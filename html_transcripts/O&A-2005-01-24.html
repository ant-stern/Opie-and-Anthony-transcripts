<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts discussing the aftermath of a New York City blizzard, mocking the excessive media coverage compared to the actual mild conditions.  Their cancelled trip to Washington D.C. was detailed, along with the FedEx mishap that lost their sound equipment.  The show featured numerous jokes about blizzard-related behaviors and traffic violations.  Intern Noah became a central target for ridicule due to his flamboyant three-piece suit and subsequently unbuttoned shirt.  Studio guests Danny and Ricky were also present. Danny contributed to the humor by bringing women's clothing from his girlfriend's closet (a pink teddy and sparkly jeans) and bribing Noah with $20 to wear them on air, which Noah eventually did.  Ricky's mustache also became a subject of mockery.  The segment included musical interludes, advertisements for XM Radio, and references to the Super Bowl and the New England Patriots.  Opie and Anthony reminisced about getting the band Days of the New drunk when they were underage.

The show then transitioned abruptly into a darkly humorous fictional anecdote about kidnapping a woman, fixated on finding a size 14, before immediately cutting to an XM Satellite Radio advertisement featuring Cal Ripken Jr.  The hosts subsequently discussed the upcoming Super Bowl and copyright issues surrounding the term.  Johnny Carson's death prompted reminiscences about his show and comparisons to Jay Leno. This led to a running gag where Noah was repeatedly sent outside in the frigid weather to fetch bananas, catering to Anthony’s preference against large ones.  A major portion focused on a controversial tsunami-themed song parody created by former producer Rick, characterized by its offensive and racially charged lyrics.  A heated on-air argument erupted between Miss Jones and Miss Info concerning their involvement and the ensuing backlash, with Miss Info highlighting her Asian heritage as a reason for her discomfort with the song's lyrics.  The song was eventually played, and the resulting controversy and potential consequences were discussed.  This segment also included continued jokes at Noah's expense and updates on his banana-retrieval errands.


A significant portion of the show featured the "Intern Runaround" bit, with Ricky repeatedly sent out for food and drinks.  The banter heavily relied on crude humor and offensive jokes.  This segment also included several parodies of children's shows and explicit 1950s sex education films, detailed descriptions of which included references to sex, homosexuality, and pedophilia.  Other topics covered included a song parody about AIDS, a critique of *The Life Aquatic*, and a caller's experience with mandatory nude swimming in high school.  Multiple XM Radio advertisements were interspersed throughout.  At one point, the hosts’ sound effects were mistakenly sent to Tennessee.


The show continued with a lengthy discussion about Wes Anderson films (*The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou*, *Lost in Translation*, and *The Royal Tenenbaums*), including critiques of the acting and comparisons to other films like *The Aviator*.  Rotten Tomatoes was heavily referenced.  The conversation was punctuated by digressions, including one on the difficulties of operating the studio’s audio equipment, which caused frustration and comedic exasperation. A call from Pauly Shore resulted in an expletive-laden rap performance.  The recurring “Intern Runaround” continued with Ricky’s errands, culminating in an incident involving a hard apple.  Audio clips from a 1950s educational film warning against pornography and its alleged link to communism were also played.

The final segment focused heavily on interrogating Noah about his dating life.  His unbuttoned shirt was criticized with sexually suggestive comments about his appearance.  The hosts aggressively questioned Noah about his ex-girlfriend Julie (including her name, age, ethnicity, location, and the circumstances of their breakup), and his first sexual experience with a girl named “A” at a house party.  Noah's discomfort was apparent, but the hosts continued with numerous vulgar jokes and sexually explicit anecdotes of their own, providing highly explicit details of both encounters.  The segment ended with a brief advertisement for the show's "WOW" stickers and the XM radio ski and snowboard report.

[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, you really are deluded.  And B-Cup.  Kind of fat-breasted and awful.  And surrounded by dullards.  Ben looks like twirly spliced film.  Oh, it's hilarious. 
[00:06:00]  Ever Steve yawns?  It looks like the back of the Batmobile and it excites.  Hawketosis.  Hawketosis.  Eric, you're not gonna cry.  Shut up.  And armed with superhuman powers.  He holds his pants down and just starts leaking into someone's garbage shed.  That's rule one.  How about if he gives you the old chin tap with his helmet?  That's all right with me.  They are living among us, average citizens, average heroes, quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place.  Controversial talkers, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:06:30]  We are just...  You better just sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  The Opie and Anthony show.  Oh.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  How are you?  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  I've been here for seven years.  She was the greatest piece of ass. 
[00:07:00]  I've ever had and I've had them all over the world.  Okay, terrific.  He was banging cocktail wakerses two at a time.  Dealing.  Dealing.  It's over, Johnny.  That's terrific.  Hello.  Exactly.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  What else? 
[00:07:30]  I'm Big Dick Blast.  Yeah.  Oh, Lordy.  Do what he says.  Do what he says.  Listen here, my Kraut Mick friend.  Yeah.  Well.  Well, good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  Good morning.  We were supposed to broadcast live from Washington, D.C. today, but we really didn't want to. 
[00:08:00]  Well, we woke up yesterday morning and there was kind of a blizzard in New York City.  Yeah.  Maybe you heard about it on the news.  So, we promptly canceled our trip to Washington, D.C.  Yep.  And we are, well, some of us are in New York.  Ben left, I don't know, Friday afternoon.  So, he's, I don't even know where Ben is.  Ben left so early. 
[00:08:30]  Why did, because we already had, like, hints that we weren't going on Saturday.  Hints?  There were already little emails going back and forth.  Hints.  Listen to the show Friday.  I told everyone, we're just not going.  We're not going.  When is D.C. going to wake up and realize we're going to get hit with a blizzard, a nor'easter,  whatever the hell they're calling it, and we're not going to be there.  But Ben's like, ah.  You know, they were predicting, like, three feet of snow in New York.  Oh, yeah.  And Ben just took off Friday afternoon, I think. 
[00:09:00]  Hurt and jerked his way all the way down to Washington.  So, he got down to D.C. early, so he's, I don't know, he's down there somewhere.  In the compound, in the complex.  What's he doing?  Is he actively working on the show today in some capacity?  Or is he just hanging out?  I don't know.  Does he have a job, like, where they put him in a room to do his job down there?  I don't know.  Did he even call anyone today?  No.  Is he sitting there, reading his email, highlighting every letter, and then not highlighting it  and highlighting it? 
[00:09:30]  Probably face down behind a bar with a crumpled Patriot's head by his beaten, fat skull.  He wasn't busy enough to make sure he got all his text messages to everyone last night.  Oh, I just opened my email.  Go, Pats.  Go, Pats.  What did he say about Brady?  Brady is that.  Tom Brady.  There is no substitute.  Brady.  Tom Brady.  There is no substitute.  He is so happy.  He's such a happy little twitchy guy.  I had to congratulate our own Joey Paisano of Paisano's and Mulberry Street, Anthony. 
[00:10:00]  Why is that?  Is he a Pats fan?  He's a massive Eagles fan.  Oh!  I forgot the Eagles.  And he's as New York as they come.  Yeah.  Joey is New York, basically.  Uh-huh.  Owns a restaurant in Little Italy, good friend of the show, you know, just good friend personally.  And for some reason, when he was a little taut, one of the first football games he ever saw  was the Eagles, and he's been a fan ever since, which is just so strange, because he's like  a hardcore Yankee fan, and, you know, he loves the Islanders, but he loves his Eagles. 
[00:10:30]  When he was a little kid, the first team he ever ran bookie on, is that why he's got  a soft spot in his hard form?  I guess the Eagles made him a lot of money when he was eight.  I don't know.  Oh, when I was a kid.  The first legs I ever broke was because someone owed me money from an Eagles game.  So we talked about it today, I don't know, in the past, I guess, but when these people  that you know, their football team wins or their whatever, you have to call them and 
[00:11:00]  congratulate them.  Like they had something to do with it.  So I called Joey, I'm like, Joey, I want to congratulate you, Eagles go to the Super  Bowl, and he's like, thank you, my friend.  And may it be a masculine victory.  He's like, thank you.  Like he had something to do with it, you know?  But he goes, I got to go.  The phone's ringing like crazy.  Everyone's calling me.  Other people calling him up.  Yeah, everyone's calling to congratulate him that the Eagles are in the Super Bowl.  I think it's that whole misery thing, you know?  If you stick with a team long enough and then they finally make it into the championship  game, then you get the congratulations. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Because as a Yankee fan, you never get people calling you up congratulating you that the  Yankees are in.  You know, they'll call you when they lose, though.  That's for sure.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  So Ben's in Washington.  All our equipment got lost by FedEx.  That's hence no sound clips in the beginning of the show.  Yeah.  Our machines that we use to do the little sound clips throughout the show, gone.  Don't know where they are.  They're lost somewhere.  Who are we kidding?  We ride those machines to make us sound good.  Oh, I know.  Oh, I love my machine. 
[00:12:00]  And now it's like, I don't have any of my crazy laughs.  You're going to be able to do this?  I don't have mini-me.  Somebody calls up and bombs.  Oh, the car crash, yeah.  I think I could do mini-me today, though.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  I can't breathe!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow! 
[00:12:30]  Oh, my God.  I'll turn it off.  Ow!  We're screwed without our machines.  But we wouldn't even have had them in Washington.  No, no.  They got lost going down there.  They sent those out Friday.  Those got lost.  So, I don't know.  So, here we are in New York City.  And, yeah, there's at least, I don't know, at least a foot of snow in the city here, right?  Yep.  A lot more out where you live, Anthony?  Yeah, a little bit more.  Not that much.  You know, they, again, made a really big deal of it. 
[00:13:00]  Well, whenever the weather says there's going to be like a little dusting of snow, there's  nothing.  When they say it's, you know, the blizzard of the century, it's going to be five feet of  snow.  You know, we got a foot of snow, pretty much.  It's blizzard 05.  Blizzard 05 has hit New York.  They could not get off of television, the news.  They interrupted everything.  24-hour coverage for what amounts to a little over a foot.  You know, some people got 16 inches. 
[00:13:30]  It says 16 inches on the weather map like where I live.  And it really wasn't 16 inches.  Well, 22 inches in Dix Hills.  That's out in the old neighborhood.  Well, you start going out east on Long Island, no one lives out there anyway.  Supposedly parts of Boston got 20 to 40 inches.  20 to 40 inches of snow.  Good.  That's insane.  It's crazy.  It's insane.  It's nuts.  It's crazy.  So then all the newscasts were basically telling everyone not to go outside yesterday.  Did they say that?  It was a beautiful sunny day. 
[00:14:00]  It was a beautiful sunny day.  Were they saying not to go outside on the news?  And if you have to, unless you have to go out, don't go out.  Unless you really have to drive, just stay at home.  Did they say that on the news less than 8 billion times?  Oh my God.  Every minute on the news they were preaching that one.  They got so screwed too because all the snow hit when the newscasts really weren't on.  You know what I mean?  They were on when it first started. 
[00:14:30]  Then there was a lonely action.  And then when the snow really hit, most of these people were in bed or whatever.  They weren't doing the news anymore.  Then the next morning, yesterday, they're all excited.  They throw all their news crews out there.  They're looking for all that great footage.  Nothing.  And all of a sudden, the sun came out.  There was no snow to be had.  And they're trying to tell people to stay inside.  And I've never seen more people outside in my life than yesterday in New York City.  It's still very icy.  Everyone was hitting Central Park with their stupid sleds and their little kids and their 
[00:15:00]  little dogs dressed up in little doggy coats and little doggy boots.  The booties.  How many times did they show that?  Dogs with their little booties.  And then they talk to the owners.  Well, you know, he doesn't like the cold either.  Ha ha.  Oh, just drop kick him in the liver.  Drop kick that dog in the liver.  Where would you get that idea from?  I don't know.  It just seems like something you would do.  By you, I mean you.  I know.  That imaginary person out there that's listening, right?  Yeah, I get it.  Yeah. 
[00:15:30]  Sure.  Chester.  So they got screwed.  They had no footage to go to.  They couldn't get the footage of the car sliding down the road.  No.  No.  Everything was fine by the time they hit the news.  One clip that I thought was great, they had a crew out of Port Jefferson, Long Island.  And it was snowing pretty good out there, out on Long Island.  And they had some woman out there, and she spent the first, I guess, three minutes of  our broadcast just talking about how awful the weather is and how dangerous it is to 
[00:16:00]  be out, how her ride there was, you know, she was put in this huge amount of danger just  getting out there.  And after about three minutes, she talks to a woman that gets off the ferry and puts  a mic in her face, and she's like, what do you think about the weather?  And the woman goes, you know, it's really not that bad.  Because it was really bad last night while going on the ferry, but I came back and it's  really not all that bad.  The woman that was doing the report got this really pissed off look on her face, pulled 
[00:16:30]  the mic away and just went, thank you very much, got her out of the shot and started talking  again and slowly got back into how bad it was.  She was pissed.  They love making it seem a lot worse than it is.  Yeah, I think people are starting to catch on that these news people are just a bunch  of dopes.  Yeah.  I think they're finally starting to realize they're just a bunch of dopes that have nothing  to report.  They have an agenda.  It's not to report what's really happening.  It's to entertain and to get more people to watch their news than watch the other news. 
[00:17:00]  People love watching the news if they feel there's an element of danger that they are directly  in that the news can tell them about.  Yeah.  So the news gets on and talks about how dangerous everything is.  All you heard yesterday, you didn't hear much about Noah.  Noah, stay out of the studio for a while.  You're distracting everybody.  Very distracting today, Noah.  We'll get into Noah's latest outfit in a little while.  Oh my God.  Go ahead, Anthony.  It's all about how dangerous it is.  They pepper in the kids making the snowman and the sledding and stuff like that and all 
[00:17:30]  the fun that goes into these storms.  But they really concentrate on, by God, don't drive.  Don't leave the house.  We could be snowed in forever.  Check the elderly.  Check the elderly.  And they panic you and they love that.  And the truth of the matter is, it isn't that bad.  What I want to understand, these reporters, yeah, that's their big thing.  If you don't need to be out here, don't drive.  It is treacherous.  Where did the news van guy get his driver's license from? 
[00:18:00]  Why is he special?  He was driving around just fine to get the dopey news reporter to where she had to be,  right?  One broadcast, they were saying, whatever you do, don't pass the snow plows.  They drive very slow, but they're there to clear the road for you.  So if you feel inconvenienced or a little slowed down, be patient.  Stay behind the snow plows.  They go immediately to a reporter in the news van with the camera out the window, 
[00:18:30]  passing a snow plow as they're filming.  Yeah, the plows are out in force on the street.  I mean, oh, it wasn't a second after this guy said this.  They're insane.  Nuts.  Crazy.  Maybe they were just trying to get footage of the snow plows just knocking everyone's mailboxes down.  That's true.  I know a lot of them listen to the program and we love you, but geez, let's relax with knocking down everything.  Driving through people's backyards, got no respect for the law.  Burying 10-year-olds and queens. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, my God.  That's true.  I did see that.  Poor little tot.  So, yeah.  And then the other observation I had.  Oh, one of the channels, they had people send in their pictures of their backyards.  Right.  With a ruler?  With the ruler.  Yeah, they were putting a ruler in the snow, taking a picture of it and emailing it to the news station.  Yeah, you sent your digital pictures to whatever channel it was.  They're all the same channel, even though they're trying to get our attention.  Whatever.  Dude, you all came in first place.  Who cares? 
[00:19:30]  Same broadcast.  Same exact broadcast.  Just different news people.  And they're showing, you know, scenes of people's backyards.  And then they show a scene of a barbecue with a foot of snow.  And it's like, looks like Johnny's not going to be having a barbecue today.  But things will be heating up on the football fields later on.  Let's go to sports.  Right, exactly.  Shut up.  Shut up is right.  And then the other thing I just want to mention, when it snows, I was walking around when the snow was coming down, I guess, Saturday night. 
[00:20:00]  You went out?  Yeah.  What are you, nuts?  It was cool walking around and stuff.  And I don't know what it is about snow, but people decide that the rules of human nature don't exist when it snows.  Like humanity's rules, laws that have been in place for thousands of years.  It snows.  Because it's like, ah, I saw a guy, I'm not even kidding, man, on a motorcycle, right, just flying down the sidewalk in Manhattan.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:20:30]  Not just driving slow, just taking off.  One of, another favorite moment I had over the weekend watching the news was a woman doing a report from the streets of Manhattan.  She's in Midtown Manhattan.  And she's doing a story, and then you hear this rumbling, and the camera turns, and it's about ten snowmobiles coming down the street.  Main Street USA, right?  Main Street USA.  It's Midtown Manhattan.  Right.  And there are snowmobiles, a gang of snowmobilers driving down the street. 
[00:21:00]  And the woman starts commenting on it, and a couple of them almost run into her.  And she's talking, and then they go back to the anchors at the desk, who are kind of laughing, smiling, a little puzzled, too, at why these people are doing this.  They go back to her.  She's hopping on the back of one of the snowmobiles and riding off.  Riding off.  And I'm home watching this, and I start laughing, like, yeah, rules don't apply. 
[00:21:30]  All of a sudden, there's a law against snowmobiling in Manhattan, I'm sure.  I'm sure.  You can't walk down the street without getting in trouble.  I'm sure you can't snowmobile.  My girlfriend turns to me and goes, I hope she gets gang raped.  She just hops on the back of snowmobiles with all these people.  She don't know who the hell they are.  Oh, it's fun.  Let's just jump on a snowmobile with these guys I don't know.  I think there's blizzard rules, you know.  There's a whole rule book for the blizzards that hit every once in a while. 
[00:22:00]  There were two guys actually walking down the road.  A newswoman found them with rifles hunting elk.  Because it's snowing.  And I guess you're allowed when it snows to just break every law whatsoever.  People cross-country skiing, pushing ATMs down the street with sledgehammers trying to crack them open,  and no one doing anything about it.  Why not?  It's snowing.  A snowmobiler was dragging a skier, you know. 
[00:22:30]  Right!  Just dragging them, sketching.  Just sketching down the street.  And why not?  Sure, why not?  It's snowing.  Rules don't apply.  Just amazing.  I love watching snow coverage because they look like a bunch of dopes.  Survival of the fittest out there when it snows.  Thank you, Eric.  Thank you.  Eric is taking over for Ben today.  Eric's not, I don't like the clothes you're wearing today.  Where's your velvet blazer and open shirt?  Danny has to come in because Danny doesn't like the, like, Danny's not going to come in? 
[00:23:00]  You're not going to?  I think he said because Danny doesn't like what you were saying, and he was shaking his head no, agreeing with the not liking.  Danny.  Danny.  Morning, fellas.  Do you want to describe Noah, the new intern's outfit?  I can't even see him right now.  Oh, you haven't seen it yet?  Well, not really. 
[00:23:30]  I just kind of ran in and heard too much at him.  Now, Noah, a lot of new people, I'm sure, turned on their XM satellite radios over the weekend.  Noah's our new intern who showed up last week in a really expensive three-piece suit.  He's new Noah, not old Noah.  Right, right, right.  Yeah, with Bruno Mali shoes and a Gucci belt buckle.  He's an intern.  Now he's laughing because I guess he's hearing the delay.  Yeah.  Well, today he, I don't know what he's wearing.  He's got a velvet blazer on. 
[00:24:00]  He's got a college shirt on with the collar up.  And the problem we're all having is that the shirt is unbuttoned pretty much to his belly button.  It's unbuttoned pretty low, showing his bare chest.  He's dressed like Robert Loja in Scarface.  Oh, very good.  Good, I was trying to figure it out.  That's a good one.  Dope.  Not a hair to be found on his young chest.  Wow.  You will be molested.  I don't have my sound board. 
[00:24:30]  No, we have no sound today.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Yeah, okay.  Danny, what do you think of his outfit?  And it is an outfit.  It's an outfit.  It's an outfit.  Pretty flammy.  But you know what?  I did kind of anticipate no one would be overdressed for today's festivities.  So I took the liberty of bringing in an alternative outfit for him to put on.  Oh.  And maybe that will be a little more comfortable for him.  Oh.  What did you bring in?  Something more like you would wear?  I think so.  It was a little dark getting everything together. 
[00:25:00]  Let me go grab my bag of goodies.  Oh.  Wow.  Danny brought in a bed, Anthony.  The interns are coming to the table, as they say.  So.  Oh, my God.  Well, Noah is getting the attention that it looks like he's looking for.  That he craves in life.  That he isn't getting from home somehow and has to.  We have to bring Noah in here.  Noah, come on in.  All right, Danny, go ahead.  What do you got?  Well, let's check it out.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, man.  Noah bag. 
[00:25:30]  Gee whiz.  You know, I feel so stupid.  It was really dark when I was getting all this together.  And I think I may have gone into the wrong drawer.  All right, Olivier.  What are you doing?  Well, I thought maybe he might look pretty.  Oh, Jesus.  What are you doing?  Well, this is probably more comfortable.  He probably feels more comfortable in something like this.  A little pink, maybe a little spaghetti strap.  Sleeveless spaghetti strap tank top.  And if he doesn't like that one.  I believe they like to call those.  It's a teddy.  It's a pink teddy.  Is it a teddy? 
[00:26:00]  Or he could maybe wear this one.  Oh, God.  That's a little, if he likes that one a little better.  Looks like from Fredericks or something.  Did you go through your sister's drawers?  Yeah, where'd you get this?  No, my girlfriend's old stuff.  She don't wear any more.  No, I really don't think I just like that.  How old is she, eight?  That stuff is tiny.  I wish.  And these little flared jeans.  Flared jeans.  Flowers and little sparkles on it.  Yeah, with little bedazzler things on it.  So, I don't know.  Dory just runs to Starbucks, so you can go and wear this instead.  I don't know if that's really up my alley.  I'm sorry to say.  There you go, Missy.  What do we want to see? 
[00:26:30]  He just threw girl jeans at him and a pink teddy, Anthony.  They're girl clothes.  What is he?  Is this like Queer Eye for the Straight Guy or something?  No, this is Straight Eye for the Queer Guy.  Now, you have to admit something, Noah.  Okay.  Your attire, especially today, is not something that you would normally see on a straight male.  Did you look at that this morning and think, like...  Well, not necessarily. 
[00:27:00]  No?  You see rock stars dress like this.  You know, like...  Rock stars dress...  Like Mick Jagger and...  Like I said, straight guys wouldn't...  No, it...  Yeah, I understand.  But rock stars are given a certain latitude for their clothes.  Because, you know, sometimes the androgyny, they play into it and whatnot.  I'm just saying that for a normal guy, an intern working on a radio show, I think it's pretty clear what hetero clothing is and what homo clothing is. 
[00:27:30]  And I believe that classifies it as homo clothing.  But I like to have my own style.  It's not about sexuality.  It's just about style.  It's a good style if you're on your way to host Dance Fever.  What I don't understand is...  Good style if you're a governor of Jersey going to the podium to announce something.  Anthony and I can't even have style at 9 o'clock at night.  No.  Let alone 5 in the morning.  I mean, you think style this early in the morning? 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  That's a problem.  But the style itself, I could see thinking style.  Even your suit, you know, though a little strange for an intern on a radio show to wear a suit, is still a guy thing, you know?  We're kind of, you know, a bunch of dopey guys sitting here.  And then you saunter in kind of wearing something that, I don't know, normally you wouldn't see a heterosexual guy wearing.  But don't I stand out from it, don't you think? 
[00:28:30]  Well, yes, you do.  Well, I'll give you that.  I'll give you that.  A little bit.  Well, maybe that's the point then.  Alrighty.  I'll accept that.  See?  All right, we can accept that, but can you just button up a little bit?  Yeah, what's it?  Did you make a conscious effort of unbuttoning your shirt so low?  Not really.  I mean, I wear it like that sometimes.  You have the chest of a little Loatian boy.  Why would you show that off?  You're not exactly built or buff.  You don't have to button it up to the neck top button.  I mean, you know.  Yeah, we want to get a little peek.  Yes.  Oh, God. 
[00:29:00]  A little glimpse of your pink skin.  Yeah, keep your neck exposed untouched by a razor.  I'm not sure I'm going to do it with these rhinestone jeans.  I don't know.  I'm sorry they're not up my alley.  Can you do Danny a favor, though?  Maybe, you know, put the clothing on for the next break?  Just try it.  If you don't like it, you don't wear it.  How much do I get paid to do this?  If you want to stand out, that sure is a way to do it.  That would make you stand out.  How much do I get paid to do this?  I mean.  As an intern?  I mean, it's all free. 
[00:29:30]  It's all free.  To where?  Maybe Daddy will give you some money.  Oh, wow.  Is he just angry?  I don't think my dad would give me money to dress like this.  I don't know.  No?  No, he's trying to get him to dress more like a man already.  I think it's a little odd that he wants him to dress like a girl.  Yeah.  Not to wear a pink tank top.  Yeah, you ever wear anything like that, a pink tank top or anything?  No, I hate to tell you not.  You ever dress like a girl for Halloween?  No, I've never had.  No?  Never had.  Just wondering.  Did you carefully pick out those colors? 
[00:30:00]  Like, ah, no, this one went with his arm.  I get it.  Did you turn something down first?  Yeah, I'm questioning Danny.  I mean, like, you know.  Your motives are a little strange there.  I don't think I've ever wanted to see a guy dress in girls' clothing and bring the clothing from home.  This outfit looks pretty coordinated.  It looks like you put a lot of thought into it, you know.  I don't know.  Well, my girlfriend picked it out.  You sure about that?  Well, I mean, how can we prove that?  Uh-oh.  How can we prove that?  You want to sniff my dick?  Oh, Noah. 
[00:30:30]  And wait.  Also, how do we know it's not yours?  Oh, hey, Danny, you're going to take that?  Hey, Noah.  You're all right, huh?  I like that.  You got balls.  Danny, you're going to take that from him?  What's this world coming to?  You got no proof.  This could be yours.  You're the one that weighs a buck twenty.  I weigh a one sixty.  There's no way I could fit into that.  That's all you, my man. 
[00:31:00]  Buck twenty, huh?  Yeah, no, just throw it on for Danny.  You try it if you don't like it?  All right.  I'll do it for money.  That's all I can say.  Do it for money.  Yeah.  Isolate that.  How much money would it take for you to fulfill Danny's fantasy?  Well, we got a dollar on the table so far.  Dollar?  I don't know.  That's not enough.  How much?  How much would it take?  Let's see.  Ten bucks.  Ten bucks?  Jesus.  Wow.  God, that sounded like some back alley somewhere, didn't it? 
[00:31:30]  Ten bucks?  Throw ten dollars down.  Jesus.  I got ten easily.  Are you kidding me?  Who got the ten bucks?  There will be no negotiating.  That's hysterical.  Ten dollars.  That's all?  Ten bucks?  But there's no guarantee I'm going to fin this.  I don't know.  Dude, this is not enough money in the world for me to throw that on.  Not to ruin it here.  Sorry.  Who's got ten?  I only have a hundred.  I only have a hundred.  I'll take that.  Which I easily would have thrown down.  Yeah.  Did you see that? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  There you go.  There you go.  A crisp twenty dollar bill.  Twenty.  I have to get in this and come back after the break.  You know what?  I'll give ten and we'll give ten because we're that type of guys.  We'll give you, yeah, a twenty.  We'll give you ten dollars each.  That's very kind of you to give me that, too.  Yeah, we're really kind.  To put me in this really nice outfit.  But I want to see both shirts.  I want to see both shirts.  What do you mean?  He's got two options for shirts.  I don't know which one I like better.  Oh, I didn't even notice the other shirts.  Oh, yeah.  That's also great.  Yeah, ten dollars per shirt, all right? 
[00:32:30]  Oh, my God.  I didn't even notice this shirt.  I don't know.  All right.  Ten dollars.  I think I might need more money.  All right, Noah.  Thank you.  Take your twenty dollars.  Oh, my goodness.  And we'll see you after the commercials.  All right.  All right.  All right.  For his big reveal, as they say on the reality shows.  Stay tuned.  It costs us a little too much money, I think.  What a dummy.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show and Noah's big reveal.  What a dummy.  Dude.  Oh, ten dollars, sucky, sucky. 
[00:33:00]  We will love you a long time.  Dude, I would have easily thrown a hundred dollars down myself, and I know you would have  matched my hundred.  Oh, when he said he wanted money, I'm automatically thinking at least a hundred.  Right.  Right.  He goes, at least a hundred dollars.  He goes, yeah, ten bucks.  Oh, didn't it just have that right outside a glory hole feel to it when he said that?  Ten dollars.  How much would you have given, seriously?  And you don't, Eric doesn't make a lot of money here.  He does okay.  You would have thrown a minimum of ten, twenty down, right? 
[00:33:30]  Dude, we would have got ten to twenty dollars a man easily.  I blow that on bananas and bagels every morning.  Huh?  Ten dollars.  He's going to humiliate himself.  Ten bucks.  Where's Steve saying it?  Why, I gave a hundred dollars to the phone guy just to take the clicking out.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  All right.  Ten bucks.  And the way he said it, ten dollars?  Oh.  Just after you hear that, the next sound is zip. 
[00:34:00]  I think he really wants to put that on.  That he was just making it look like it was about the money, but he slipped by saying ten dollars.  Ten bucks.  How cheap.  You're cheapening yourself.  Dude, we got away with murder.  Oh, dear.  All right.  Why don't we take our first break here?  People want to hear that song that we like to play.  I don't even know if it's here.  What song is that?  Craig from Tennessee is requesting it on line seven. 
[00:34:30]  Boo, boo, boo, boo.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I don't know if I can find it, though.  Jesus.  Let me try to find that.  All right, Anthony.  Why don't we take a quick break?  All right.  Do we have anything to play and to break so we can actually break?  Hmm.  Use PSAs?  Do you what?  Abuse PSAs?  They're not long enough.  No.  Where was that?  I got something off of.  Where was that cool mashup that we played the other day?  Eh.  Mashup.  All right.  I can't find anything right now.  Here.  Here it is.  Which one? 
[00:35:00]  Hives and Prodigy?  Yeah.  Let's try that again.  Oh.  That was a good one.  That was kind of cool, right?  And we'll take a quick break and we'll continue.  We'll talk a little football.  Johnny Carson died.  We got some clips to get to as far as that goes.  Anthony brought in some kind of homo.  Homo.  No, they're old educational films from the 50s and 60s about raising your kid.  The homo.  So they don't want pornography in children's life and they talk about the dreaded homosexual. 
[00:35:30]  You know, these predatorial homosexuals are at your schools.  Your churches.  Watch out, boys, for the homosexuals.  Yeah.  Who knew it was that big of a problem?  Almost as bad as communism back then.  We'll continue.  It's the O.P. and Anthony program.  It's the O.P. and Anthony program. 
[00:36:00]  Do I want, guess I can't, if I don't, because I wanna.

[00:42:00]  There's something you need to change.  I'm not the one who's trying to be.  You're an enemy.  There's something you need to change.  Days of the new, huh?  Nice.  Good job.  We used to get these guys drunk  when they were underage.  Remember those days, Anthony?  Back in the day.  Back in the day when we were at AAF,  these guys were like just  rock stars at, I don't know,  19 years old.  Travis Meeks on lead vocals. 
[00:42:30]  Good friend of ours, actually.  The band didn't get along with each other.  That's for sure.  Well, they used to have  a lot of fistfights and stuff.  It might have been all the gigs  with black eyes and bloody noses.  You know, the more I think about it,  I think you and I caused the breakup  of Days of the New  because they weren't allowed  to drink legally  and you and I were major  F-up, fuck-ups back then.  Yep.  And these guys would come up to us,  they would be playing  a radio station gig for AAF  and like, dude, we need some beer.  Like, ah, we'll get you beer. 
[00:43:00]  Why not?  We get them all drunk.  Next thing you know,  one of the guys has a black eye  and stuff.  I think we started them  down that road.  Anyway.  A little booze.  It's the only virus  spreading across America  and it cost us a whole $10,  but I see Noah walking around  outside the studio  in the outfit that Danny brought in.  He fit in that?  That Danny is claiming  the outfit is his girlfriend's  or some clothes 
[00:43:30]  his girlfriend used to wear.  and he gave this some thought  over the weekend,  like, I'm going to bring in  my girlfriend's clothes  for Noah.  The interns hate Noah.  Why is that?  They hate the new Noah  because the new Noah  is a go-getter.  And he's shaking their heads.  He's trying too hard.  He's a go-getter  and he's trying to get noticed.  He knows that these guys,  you know, Derek, Nathaniel,  and Danny,  they've been with us  since day one here  at XM Satellite Radio  and earning respect  through their expertise. 
[00:44:00]  And these interns  have dug in.  They know their roles  and, you know,  they got some respect  from you and I  and they work hard and stuff.  So Noah's trying to figure out  where he fits in.  And he figures  he's going to make headway  through his clothing.  And it's not working out, huh?  So Danny brought in  this outfit  and Noah is about  to enter the studio  in the outfit.  Should we have  all the interns in here  so they can all  laugh at him openly?  Oh, shoot.  I should have kept that  in my head  and just said,  hey, interns, 
[00:44:30]  come on in here.  All right,  we got fans in the studio.  And get the other one.  Hello.  Who's that new  creepy looking one?  Bring him in too.  Yeah, he's really creepy too.  He really is awful.  Creepy.  Yeah, look at this little creep.  Look at this guy.  Oh, Jesus.  If it means 20 minutes  of air time,  I'll come in  and drag tomorrow.  Dude, what's your name?  My name's Ricky.  Ricky?  Yeah.  Are you digging  that mustache?  Oh, no.  I've got to take care  of that soon.  Yeah, why don't we  shave it today?  All right?  It's awful.  Why not?  If you want to work  for the show, 
[00:45:00]  I think you've got  to shave the mustache.  Sure, why the hell not?  You know what?  We're like George Steinbrenner.  No facial hair.  Oh, is that it?  Except for Anthony.  That's it.  As I'm saying that,  I turn to you and I go,  oh, yeah,  Anthony's got to go deep.  I'm an exception to the rule.  Yeah, he is.  Shave that, please.  When are you in here next?  I'm in here Wednesday.  All right, make sure  the mustache is gone, okay?  All right.  You're the type of guy  that will babysit  and when people aren't looking  you just bite the baby's  fingers and hands?  I haven't babysit  ever.  No? 
[00:45:30]  You're a little creepy.  Creepy?  Maybe we're just  getting to know you.  What's your ethnic background, sir?  I'm El Salvadorian.  You are?  Yes.  Are you a fan  of this radio show?  Yes, I am.  All right.  See, I'm a rain man type.  This guy's at all our gigs, right?  No, all of them.  Some of them.  A lot of them.  I've seen him around.  All right, you've seen him around  too, I think?  Yeah, some of the appearances.  So, Tham, what do you think  of Noah's outfit today  with the shirt button  to the unbuttoned  all the way down  to his belly button?  It was a little  Austin Powers for my taste.  I don't know.  It's just very high fashion.  With the velvet 
[00:46:00]  blazer.  Today the blazer  is not velvet.  Today the blazer  is corduroy.  Oh, it is?  It's a different one  than he wore last week.  Danny, how bad  do you want to punch Noah  in the head?  Just be honest with us.  I'd love to just take  a crowbar to his stomach.  I hate people like that.  He really doesn't like him.  What do you hate about him?  Because he may be,  you know what?  No, it's not even that.  It's just, you know,  the whole attitude.  Like, he's wearing  a suit and a velvet blazer  to try and make an impression. 
[00:46:30]  This is just the wrong show  to be doing that for.  Wow.  I just, you know,  you bust on him  for wearing a blazer,  he comes in in a suit.  You bust on him  for wearing a suit,  he wears the gayest thing ever.  I just think...  It's just he's trying  so hard to get on air  because of his wacky outfits.  Yeah.  It makes me a little angry,  a little meek guy  in the booth over there.  All right.  The lazy kid back there, Derek?  No, I'm saying me.  All right.  All right, so why don't we  let Noah back  into the studio here.  Here he comes  with the outfit  that Danny brought in 
[00:47:00]  for him to wear.  Oh, Jesus.  And this cost us $10,  Anthony.  $10.  I feel pretty  and witty  and bright  and I pity  and you go  and meet you  I can't even look.  How's those pants fitting?  It looks like you've still  got a lot of room  in the crotch there.  Yeah, the pants fit pretty well,  but this tank,  I don't know.  It's a little tight.  Anthony, you want to...  I can't even explain what...  No, he's in 
[00:47:30]  He's in a pink little  girl's teddy.  Girl's teddy, yeah.  It's kind of see-through,  which is a little embarrassing.  Oh, that's embarrassing?  But the corduroy blazer  isn't, right?  No, not at all.  Dude, you fit  in his chick's jeans, man.  That is a little odd.  Yeah, but I'm a small guy.  I mean...  You put your belt on, too?  Oh.  Really?  Why did you have...  You put his Gucci belt on.  Why'd you feel like  you had to put  your Gucci belt back on?  Well, if you wear  a pair of jeans,  you gotta wear a belt.  I don't know.  You really are  a diminutive little fruit. 
[00:48:00]  Well, I don't even know.  Look, I got 20 bucks  out of this.  You certainly did.  And this wasn't hard work,  so what the hell?  Yeah, 20 dollars  and everyone gets to see  this on the internet.  I think that's a fair  trade-off, sure.  Yeah.  Your self-worth  is 20 dollars.  Good.  Wow, these interns  just are vicious.  I just don't think  they'll like me too much.  I don't know. 
[00:48:30]  I don't understand it.  They're jealous.  They're jealous of the  airtime you're getting, Noah.  Nathaniel could never  fit into that.  That's why he's angry.  He's just jealous.  That's a challenge.  Are you liked  at school and stuff?  Yeah, totally.  Yeah?  Absolutely.  Not people like this  at school  that are giving you  crap or anything?  No.  No?  Do you got a lip gloss  on or something?  Would you?  Would you?  Would you?  Would you?  I put Chapstick  on in the morning.  I mean, it's cold outside,  but I don't put 
[00:49:00]  lip gloss on.  No.  No.  All right.  It looks a little rosy.  A little rosy there.  No.  All right.  Danny, is this...  You want him to  throw the other one on too?  I think that's up to Jim.  I mean...  I...  Look,  I'm not saying  that you look  actually quite delicious  in this outfit.  I'm saying that I think  that both shirts  should be shown  just because it was  $10 a shirt.  Oh, yeah.  That's true.  That's only fair.  Or are you going to  have to make change  and give Anthony  $10 back?  So this was probably  the 20-odd.  You're like,  I've got to wear both.  Just a different shirt.  That's all.  I don't care. 
[00:49:30]  Jesus Christ.  I'd like to see  the pink model.  Some form of prostitution  is going on right here.  I don't care.  Not the good kind.  No.  Not the good kind.  He's sweating now.  Did you see him  dabbing some sweat  off his forehead  with the pink little shirt?  I do hope  the next time  you try to bang  your girlfriend  in this outfit  you think of him.  His armpit hair all over.  She doesn't wear anymore  because I had a feeling  that was going to be a problem  so I made sure  to grab stuff  that she doesn't fit into anymore.  Does your girlfriend  have small boobs 
[00:50:00]  like Noah?  No, she's...  I mean, she's all right.  She's got like  full B's.  That's okay.  Nothing wrong with that.  She's a little girl.  Yeah, she's only like  5'5'1".  I have to question that.  If she has full B's  then how am I fitting in this  and I don't have anything?  Ooh.  Yeah.  No, I don't know, no.  And this is pretty damn tight to me.  You're really splitting hairs  at this point, man.  Well, I just had to say it.  Yeah, you showed him.  I think he raises a good point.  What are you trying to say? 
[00:50:30]  I don't think he can fit  much boobage in here, really.  So you're basically saying  that his girlfriend is flat.  Pretty flat, yeah.  I'd have to say that.  Perhaps.  His man has much better pecs  than Danny's girlfriend.  Yeah, perhaps his girlfriend's  back isn't like that.  He's not...  His girlfriend is in shape like you  and has a more feminine  like back  that would fit more in the front.  Yeah, but see, women have curves.  So if you put like  a woman's curves in here  and then you put  a pair of breasts in this tank.  Wait, wait, wait.  There's something on... 
[00:51:00]  It's not going to work.  What was this motion  that you were doing?  He's digging deeper.  Like this doesn't fit.  What the fuck was that?  I'm just saying...  I'm just saying...  He's a new guy.  I'm just saying...  He's getting on him too now.  Whoever owned this tank...  Well, because he was saying  how women have curves  but he had to like  move his hands down  to his body to show like...  From his breasts  down to his hips  he moved his hands.  I was trying to demonstrate  that whoever owned this tank  really had to have  not much up top.  I'm just going to have  to be honest with you.  Dude, you might want  to do a sit-up too.  My God.  Yeah, this looks like  an outtake from Boogie Nights.  So you want to kiss me or...? 
[00:51:30]  I never said that.  You didn't just recently  get your car painted,  did you?  Want to show me?  But I'm still wondering  why you wanted to see me in this.  You know, that's...  Miss, I didn't want  to see you in that.  I just thought it might be...  I might get a chuckle  out of it.  And for the rest of the guys  here, I might have  a little giggle too.  Yeah, Danny brought in  a bit for the show.  It's great.  I'm loving it.  Not that.  I'm loving the fact  that he brought the bit in.  All right. 
[00:52:00]  So now you want to see him  in the pink shirt, Jimmy?  Just for a minute, I think.  I mean, it couldn't be  any worse than that one.  You got a crisp 20.  Yeah.  That's way it's nice.  Yeah.  I mean, this is not much work,  so I don't mind doing it.  All right.  Yeah, there you go.  All right.  Can you do me a favor?  I'm kind of thirsty.  Can you run over to Starbucks  real quick for me?  In that?  In this.  How much?  Oh, jeez.  Oh, five bucks.  I'll give you a smack in the face.  I'll let you have the change  from the coffee.  Oh, deal. 
[00:52:30]  What do I change?  Speaking of which...  Do you swear to preserve...  All right.  What?  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Sorry.  I was going to ask you  first for my change.  It's fine.  All right.  Oh, change.  Oh, look at that.  I forgot, too.  They dragged me in here  because it was like,  oh, forget the change.  Just come in here for a second.  All right.  Well, thank you.  Thank you, Noah.  It's always a pleasure  to make a fool of myself here,  so always a pleasure.  Anytime.  I can't look.  I can't look, either.  So I guess I'll be back in 
[00:53:00]  with this thing.  Oh, the pink one.  Counting the minutes.  And lose the Gucci belt, okay?  All right.  All right.  There he goes.  Oh.  I don't know.  I got this whole Mike Myers  as Steve Rebell  and 54 feeling here.  That really is it.  Why don't you come here  on the bed?  Why don't you come up here 
[00:53:30]  on the bed?  Lose the belt, too.  Oh, my God.  Dude, 20 bucks.  20 bucks for that.  That just amazes me.  There is...  How fine is the line  between accepting $20  to put on that  and accepting $10  to just...  At a truck stop.  And a truck stop turl it.  I've done...  It's not a lot of work. 
[00:54:00]  Gulp.  Not a lot of work.  Yeah, I swallow every day.  Dude, I've done a lot  of stupid things in my life.  I mean, there's just  not enough money in the world  to do what that kid just did.  And he did it for $10.  And this from a guy  that put a marshmallow  up his butt.  All right.  At least you had your pride  and didn't take money for it.  I would have been accepted  if I didn't.  Damn it.  All right.  Wow. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, you got him.  The listeners want  to comment badly.  Let's go to Bo  in North Carolina.  Bo.  Yo, Bo.  Hey, Bo.  Buttons all down  the way they're supposed to be?  That's the only reason  I've kept Bo on the line  just to make sure.  Bo?  Hello, Bo.  Oh, today's problem.  I can't click the phones.  Ah.  Can't click the phones there.  Can you do it manually?  Yeah, we'll try that.  All right.  I mean, you know,  if you're just like that  and you accept $20  from another man,  normally the next sound  you hear is 
[00:55:00]  crinkle, crinkle.  It's a little weird.  I wish I had my car crash.  I know.  It's a little weird.  Car crash here.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  Thank you.  I can't hang up  on these guys now.  Hold on.  Let's try that.  Oh, now I have to count, though.  All right.  One, two, three, four, five,  six.  Six.  One, two, three,  four, five, six.  All right.  Donnie, what's going on?  Hey, I can't believe  no one picked up on this.  He sounds like Rad  from Fast Times.  You think it is? 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, I was reading  some email over the weekend.  A lot of people say  he sounds like Rad  from Fast Times.  From Rat from...  Really?  Yeah, what would  Mike Damone say to him?  A little bit.  Hey, Rad,  where'd you get  that pink shirt?  Out of the hamper?  A little bit,  a little bit.  Punch it out.  Well, I wish I could  punch out,  but I can't.  It's the attitude.  You put on  a pink shirt. 
[00:56:00]  You want to hear,  are you about  a size 14?  Would you?  That's next.  Well, what's wrong  with putting on  a girl's skin shirt?  It has breasts in it.  You know, it's nice.  What's wrong with that?  I'll kill a girl,  make a suit out of her,  and put it on  for 30 bucks.  This is from  Silence of the Lambs,  the musical.  This one,  we don't play this one  as much as the other one,  but let's give it  a listen today.  I like this.  Are you a size 14? 
[00:56:30]  Superficial people,  I don't think  looks matter.  Some folks  weigh a hundred pounds,  but I want  someone fatter.  I want a girl  who'll fit me  to a tee.  A woman who'll look good  on me.  Say.  Are you about  a size 14?  Are you about  a size 14?  In order to get victims,  you've got to lie 
[00:57:00]  and trick you,  so I put my arm  inside a sling.  I've got her in my sights,  she's appropriately fat.  I'll wait for her  to notice me,  I hope she fed her cat.  She's perfect, yes,  but nothing remains  yet to be seen.  Is she about  a size 14?  She'll see you  with this count,  I'll get her in the van.  I'll punch her in the face  and drive away  and that's the plan.  I'll cut off all the skin  and wear it like a dress.  I'll dump her in the ocean,  let the cops  clean up the mess.  Are you about  a size 14? 
[00:57:30]  Are you about  a size 14?  If you want  to find the one,  you need to throw  the weights a ton.  And she's also  gotta be naive.  I'll keep her in a well,  they'll never ever find her.  I'll tuck my dick  between my legs,  you'll think it's a vagina.  I'll look just like a girl,  by golly,  I'll have fun,  but for now be quiet,  she'll make a sample.  closer she comes.  Can I give you  a high end without?  Mm-hmm.  You look a little  handicapped. 
[00:58:00]  Mm-hmm.  She's coming  towards the van.  I'll ask her to get in.  I'll check her tag  and if she fits  a cut off all her skin.  Are you about  a size 14?  Are you about  a size 14?  My hobbies include sewing,  if you like me,  let's get going.  And I'll put you  in a hole  where you can scream.  I'll make this  a size 14.  I'm looking  for a size 14.  She brought this  on herself  because she offered  me her help  and she's an idiot 
[00:58:30]  for trusting me.  Are you about  a size 14?  His plan was  working weight.  He's got her  in his trunk.  She took the bait  and now she's  out of luck.  What happened  to the potatoes?  I have no idea  what you're talking  about.  From O&A Pictures.  You always like potatoes,  that's not new.  A horrifying story.  Did he forget the potatoes?  Of a man.  I need the potatoes.  Without potatoes.  Danny, you forget  the potatoes?  It won't happen again,  I can promise you it.  How far will  one man go?  Well, I'm going to have 
[00:59:00]  to wait for the potatoes.  For potatoes.  The potato diva.  My potatoes are here.  Come here.  Open your mouth.  Eat.  Eat.  Eat your potatoes.  Don't eat.  That's the way  that's doing.  You say potato.  He says potato.  That's a big thing  and potatoes, Danny.  Everything's delicious.  The potato diva.  I need the potatoes.  Yeah.  Coming soon.  I want potatoes  and I want eggs  and I want hot sauce.  God, you've gotten fat. 
[00:59:30]  The stories.  Here we go.  Get ready to go to here.  The memories.  The time from the top.  The magic.  I don't believe  what I just saw.

[01:01:00]  It's everything  24-7.  XM 202.  The O&A virus.  It's everything  all the time.  Anthony,  XM 202.  What a wacky morning.  Noah, the new intern,  is now in a pink teddy  walking around outside there, 
[01:01:30]  Anthony.  Earning his $20.  The hard way.  $10 per teddy today.  Great.  All right.  Congratulations to the Eagles fans  and the Pats fans.  It's going to be a good Super Bowl,  though, no?  I just see blowout.  By the what?  By the Patriots?  You know me,  and New England,  Boston,  not a big fan  of their sports teams,  but you've got to give it to them. 
[01:02:00]  The Pats have just  blitzkrieged their way  through the season  and the postseason,  and now it just looks like  it's going to be a blowout.  I don't know about that.  Steelers had a really good year.  Yeah, they did.  The Eagles came to play yesterday.  And the Pats killed them.  Pats killed the Eagles  earlier this year?  No.  Pats killed who?  Pittsburgh Steelers.  You said the Steelers  had a really good year.  Yeah, and then the Eagles  beat them really badly yesterday.  The Jets almost beat them, too, 
[01:02:30]  so it doesn't mean much, I guess.  All right, there goes  our football talk.  All right, good.  Great.  That was great.  Got it.  Got that out of the way.  I'm looking forward  to the big game.  It's called the Super Bowl.  On radio stations,  you can only call it  the big game.  The big game.  Oh, we'll get the same memo.  For some reason,  you're not allowed  to say the Super Bowl.  They have no problem  you're promoting  their big game.  Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  But if you say Super Bowl,  they come after you  and try to sue you  for saying a word.  Some fictitious league 
[01:03:00]  out there is trying  to tell you what words  you can say or not say.  You can't say Super Bowl.  Because it's copywritten?  Yeah.  Super Bowl is copywritten.  Yeah.  I think you can say it like,  hey, the Super Bowl is,  you know,  next whatever it is,  you know,  on Sunday.  You know,  you could say it.  You just can't use it  to promote yourself  or sell anything.  We can't call ourselves  Opie and Anthony  the official show  of the Super Bowl.  Why not?  Although I guess we could.  Sure.  Why not? 
[01:03:30]  Why not?  They're showing  Johnny Carson on TV.  Big bloated Johnny or?  Yeah, I mean,  the young 1968  leather clad comeback Johnny.  The paparazzi  was onto something  because out of nowhere  they start showing  pictures of Johnny Carson  coming out of his  doctor's office  and things like that  and he was a lot bigger  than we all remember  him looking on TV.  Yeah.  and sure enough  only a week or two later  no, not even.  I think last week  all those pictures  were in all the tabloids  in the local papers 
[01:04:00]  here in New York  and Johnny passed away  at the age of 79.  Dead.  Good old Johnny Carson  who gave pretty much  every comedian  that you know  and love their break.  That's over the age of  I don't know,  40 maybe, right?  The younger guys  it's Jay Leno  giving them the break.  It's not the same vibe  that Jay Leno,  you know?  It's not the tonight  thank you for the huge banana.  It's not the same vibe.  Oh my god.  Bananas got weight to it. 
[01:04:30]  Dude, he doesn't like  big bananas.  I hate the big banana.  Mustache guy.  I hate the big banana.  Can you get mustache guy  in here?  But, you know,  because now I gotta peel it  and break it up  and eat it.  Why don't you explain  to the new intern  that you don't like  the really big bananas.  Is this the only banana  they had, sir?  It was a bunch  but I grabbed the first  one that came  first one that came  on your hand.  This is a big banana,  isn't it?  Do they have any  smaller ones?  I think that was  about all the sizes  they had.  If you want me to go  down and get another one 
[01:05:00]  because sometimes  like Nathaniel  when he has to go  he'll get two  smaller bananas  because he knows  my phobia  to big,  thick, meaty  nine-inchers.  There's only one way  the intern's  gonna learn.  Anthony needs  two small bananas  for this one, okay?  Thank you, mustache guy.  I wouldn't send him back.  Yeah, but he's gotta learn.  He's gotta learn.  And hurry up  because Anthony  gets hungry this time  of the morning.  And bring me one too,  a big one,  but not that one.  Jimmy, hold on, 
[01:05:30]  hold on.  Tell him Jimmy's  just kidding.  No, I want one.  Is he kidding?  Yeah, he's kidding.  Okay.  Can he hear me out there?  Huh?  Can he hear me out there?  Yeah, I know, I know.  Is he out the door?  No, he's in the other studio.  Oh.  What's taking him so long?  Yeah.  I need my bananas.  He needs his banana.  Hurry up.  Please.  Aw, Johnny  with the rat on his head. 
[01:06:00]  Why is she crying?  Johnny never talked  to her off mic.  Who is she?  She's the wildlife woman.  Joan Emery or whatever.  She should come on  with her animals  and crack everyone up.  He's gone?  He's gone.  All right, Anthony,  today on the program  it's intern runaround.  Oh, going to make him  go out for Jimmy's big banana?  Yeah, so he's going to come back  with two smaller bananas for you  and then we're going to go,  I thought Jimmy said  he wanted a banana  and then we're going to  send him out for that.  And then at that point  we're going to need something else  and we're going to see  how many times  we can send him out  before he loses his effing mind. 
[01:06:30]  I think it'll be  intern frostbite.  Yeah.  Like 10 degrees out.  So Johnny Carson  passed away.  It was huge news  and it was fun  to watch all the old footage  last night on TV.  Yeah, it certainly was.  I had gotten the DVDs  about a couple of months ago.  Yeah.  So I was watching all of them.  That's what they're doing  is that when they play  those clips  it's pretty much  what you can get  on the DVD.  Which is cool, man.  It's like  it brings you right back.  I grew up watching Johnny. 
[01:07:00]  Well, what was great  about seeing all the old clips  of Johnny Carson  it just reminds you  of how much of a hack  Jay Leno really is.  Yeah.  He really is.  I mean, Johnny Carson  no one  I mean, I think Letterman  is so much better  than Leno to begin with  but I mean  but Carson  I mean  no one will come close  to what this guy  was doing  with late night TV.  You know?  Yeah.  He made it look so natural.  They're saying he was  the greatest straight man  in the business  and he just made it  look so natural.  Jay Leno  a lot of the stuff  he's doing  his old bits 
[01:07:30]  that Carson did  reworked  and you can see  that he's just  trying too hard  trying too hard  and it all just  came very natural  to Johnny Carson  when he was doing it  you know?  And then they get  all these old  I mean  older than dirt comedians  all over TV  last night  that you haven't seen  in 20 years.  Dug them up  they used to sit  on Johnny's couch  and be interviewed  they're on there  like once a month  a lot of these guys.  Tonight Johnny's guests  and there they were 
[01:08:00]  the old comics  the old Vegas show people  oh they bring them all out  I grew up with all that stuff  I think everybody  you know  he was on so long  that everybody  grew up watching it  it's like such a part  of the  you know  growing up in the 70s  you know  sitting there late at night  and turning on  the Tonight Show.  I remember just being a kid  you know  watching Johnny Carson  with my parents and stuff  and the only time  I get excited  doing radio  because people say  man you guys get to meet  a lot of famous people  and stuff  the only time  I really get excited 
[01:08:30]  and it's a weird thing  with me  is when  is when an intern  is dressed in pink  and a tank top  no  no  is when we  get to interview someone  that was on  Johnny Carson  for some reason  that's what  just really gets me  excited about what we do  and celebrities in general  like we  not the Leno one though  anyone that's on Leno  is like who cares  no not really  sorry Jimmy  not that Tonight Show  the Hack Tonight Show  yeah  but I mean like 
[01:09:00]  you know  Willie Nelson  was on Johnny Carson  a million times  and then  we were lucky enough  to interview  Willie Nelson  a few years back  and for some reason  to me  I don't know  it was overly exciting  because I remember  just being a little kid  watching someone  like Willie Nelson  on Johnny Carson  a lot of those guys  you just didn't care about  as a kid either  but for some reason  it was cool to watch it  on the Tonight Show  like who cares about  George Goble  when you're a kid  you know  and George Goble  comes on  but you just watch it  you know 
[01:09:30]  because it was kind of cool  the interaction  Johnny had with those people  and he never competed  either by the way  he never competed  with his guests  he never tried  to outshine his guests  he would throw up  a softball  and step back  and let you shine  well they said  that was the beauty of him  he had no problem  letting other people  be you know  funnier than him  and that's a talent  you know  to actually know  when to step aside  and let the guest shine  yeah  oh yeah  and a lot of these people  today that do  variety shows  or talk radio shows  I could name a bunch 
[01:10:00]  of examples  they have to be  the big star always  and you know  Johnny Carson  would you know  step aside  and let you be funny  right  like we were on there  you know  but I mean  this is  yeah I remember  this is what everyone's  been saying  and yeah I get that  you know  and they showed  a clip of George  Goble  what is his name  George Goble  Goble  what did he ever do  was he a comedian  or something  half these people  I don't even know  what they did  one of those comics  from way back when  they showed a clip  of him  Bob Hope  and Dean Martin  I guess they would  happen to be down 
[01:10:30]  the hall  and just decide  to come staggering  in  you know  on a Johnny Carson  show  and they're all  drunk  drinks in their hands  they have drinks  in their hands  and they're smoking  and they're just  having a good old time  yeah they would  sit down  and drink  and smoke  and tell jokes  and you know  you could never  get away with that  these days  imagine some guy  sitting down  on a talk show  with scotch  drinking it  and smoking a cigarette  there'd be an outrage  oh this  oh people are watching  the children  if they see  blah blah blah  these old guys 
[01:11:00]  and they don't care  and look at what  look at what it gets them  death by emphysema  well yeah  they were showing  a lot of clips  where it was obvious  when they went to  some kind of video clip  Carson was sneaking  a quick puff  and then they would  come back  and you would see  the smoke around the desk  like you just know  you knew that he was  smoking during the show  there was an ashtray  that was on like  a slide or something  in his desk  and he'd smoke  and then put the cigarette  in the ashtray  and slide it back  in his desk  that's a habit  but they used to smoke  right on the air 
[01:11:30]  there were ashtrays  on his desk  and the guest  and the host  and they're just  puffing away like crazy  that's a habit  when you can't even  go an hour  while you're doing  your TV show  they never thought  about it that way though  it was kind of like  you know  it's a fixture  it's part of the set  well this was  Carson saying goodbye  back in 92  you people watching  I can only tell you  that it has been  an honor  and a privilege  to come into your homes  all these years  and entertain you  and I hope  when I find something  that I want to do  and I think you will like 
[01:12:00]  and come back  that you'll be  as gracious  inviting me into your home  as you have been  I bid you a very  heartfelt  good night  that was the last  thing he said  on the Tonight Show  and that was it  and he dropped off  the face of the earth  he didn't want to do  anything else  yeah he came back  a couple times  for just very minimal  things  and that was it  and then he went  into hiding basically  he didn't want to be  bothered  you know  did you hear Joan Rivers  because she loved him  for years  but then he never  forgave her  when she left  he went to do 
[01:12:30]  her own show  against him  yeah  but Edgar hooked up  and it bombed  and she was  the interviewer  and she was speaking  very diplomatically  about him  she's not going to  trash Carson  but they said  something about  his warmth  and his generosity  and Joan goes  you got the wrong  person  he never forgave me  so I kind of  respected about him  that's kind of good  yeah she tried to call  him he just hung up  on her  yeah yeah  she called him  to say  look I'm moving on  Fox is giving me  a shot at  late night TV  and Johnny not  good luck or anything  just hung up on her  and that was the last  time he ever talked  to Joan Rivers  hello  and Larry King 
[01:13:00]  dragged her out  of the woodwork  last night  to talk about  Johnny Carson  oh they're bringing  everybody out  freaking Don Rickles  how old is Don Rickles  he's still one of my  favorite comedians  of all time  he's got to be  80 something right  and the guy  is still sharp  and sarcastic  and dry as they come  and I freaking  love that guy  yeah  he was just hilarious  last night  on Larry King  just making fun  of everybody  we have any clips  of that  well no  we got a Don Rickles  clip but I think  it's just  him being serious  about Johnny's 
[01:13:30]  passing  let me think  oh it's really  long too  forget that  thanks Steve  for making the  clip short  like we suggested  Rich Little  Johnny Carson  as far as I'm  concerned  will never  never really  die  because  this freaking  hack  Rich Little  no one has  asked Rich Little  to do a Johnny  Carson impression  on TV  in the last  two decades  and he's  such an opportunist  like oh I'll  get my Johnny  Carson out there  for everybody  yeah oh yes 
[01:14:00]  Eric  didn't he play  Carson in that  late shift movie  yeah he was fat  there was yeah  there was a big  falling out I guess  between Rich Little  and Johnny Carson  for a while  I didn't know that  yeah  I don't know  if they made up  before he dies  over here  but yeah  there was like  a falling out  why did Johnny  ask him to get  down to 2.30  before he played  him in that  stupid film  what a fatso  he was  nothing like  Carson  and his impression  is kind of weird  Johnny Carson  as far as 
[01:14:30]  I'm concerned  will never  never really  die  because I'll  continue doing  him  and probably  Rich to the  delight of  everyone as  it has been  for as long  as you've been  doing him  not everyone  well  Johnny was  probably the  one voice  other than  Nixon  that I was  associated with  and now I'm  coming out of  character  crackly old  man voice  going  that was  really a bad  impression  of Johnny  Carson  you know  I don't know 
[01:15:00]  no wonder  you're not  really working  on TV  anymore  Rich  maybe years  ago it  worked  the weird  thing about  impressions  is  the more  the longer  you do  them  and I mean  like by  years  the worse  they get  it just  happens  your bananas  are here  oh my bananas  are here  let me see  are these  keepers  oh  hey  I think  he did  a good  job  see how  those bananas  don't look  like you know  huge schlongs  I like them  to look like  adolescents  so he still 
[01:15:30]  gets the  nutritional value  of one big  one but he  doesn't look  weird eating  it  but it doesn't  hurt going  in  so there you  go  thank you  why do you  have to thank  Nathaniel  what  oh he told  you where  to go  yeah I kind  of cheated  in a little  bit  but you  know I  had to  call him  up for  a splicision  oh my god  a splicision  a splicision  a splicision  a splicision  yes  oh ok  so thanks  to Nathaniel 
[01:16:00]  for the  splicision  why are you  carrying that  in your pocket  that big  banana  oh they  want to  take the  big banana  back  leave it  here  but I  need you  to  I want  a bagel  covered bagel  with a little  bit of cream  cheese please  where are you  going to send  them for the  bagel  where are you  going to  don't go  to that place  downstairs  I hate  that place  no I  don't go  to pick a  bagel  I get sick  that once  yeah food  poisoning  Starbucks  I don't like  their bagels  they're never  soft enough  let's go 
[01:16:30]  give me a  bagel  get it  there's a  deli on  on 7th and  56 that  has good  bagels  cream cheese  on the  side  7th and  56  right around  there  yeah  it's right  but don't  get don't  get one  right around  here man  seriously  I don't  like these  all right  all right make  sure he's  he's leaving  the air  make sure he  knows too  oh my god  it's 90  it's 10  degrees out  it's 10  degrees out  boy you  would be  really good 
[01:17:00]  at being a  prick man  yeah you  would be  really good  at it  I can't  even I  can't even  do that  I'm just  hoping that  the cold  will freeze  that awful  little cancer  mustache  doesn't he  look like  Babu from  the Seinfeld  episodes  oh that's  what it is  yeah  Babu  oh Babu  you're a  bad man  jitty  has he  left  you're just  tuning in  it's uh  all right  well we have  another clip  of Rich Little 
[01:17:30]  talking about  Johnny Carson  Carson was  the best  he really  was and  the thing  was he  had the  ability to  listen  he would  listen to  his guests  and not  look at  notes  and he  could bounce  off what  you were  saying  and he  if an  act was  dying or  just not  being funny  or very  interesting he  could jump  in and  save that  person  he had  charm  he had  likability  he had 
[01:18:00]  that little  boy quality  he was  very good  to me  and when  I did  one of  the Martin  roast  and pointed  out in  my routine  that he  had 23  mannerisms  he said  you know  after watching  Rich  I think  they should  put me  in a  street  jacket  what  where's  my  sound  effect  no kidding  we need  the sound  effects  badly  today  for this  after that 
[01:18:30]  Rich Little  should do  an impression  of our  Bud Dwyer  the Don  Rickles clip  is long  we'll start  it up  and see  what it's  all about  here  his personality  was something  else  he was a  low key  guy  that came  on  and his  attitude  his facial  expressions  were marvelous  when I was  on the show  he always  left the  space for  me to  look good  and he  never  followed  the notes  when I  come on  and say  how's  your  mother  I'd say  well it's  none of  your business  leave me alone  find a job  whatever  and we 
[01:19:00]  went from  there  and it  always  turned out  great  and even  socially  he always  had a  wisecrack  with me  and he  was the  kind of  guy  if you  gave him  a hug  he was  from the  Midwest  the shoulders  got a  little tight  because he  wasn't used  to that  but I  broke him  in  first thing  you know  we were  dancing  together  well  there  you're  not buying  curtains  however  together  not that  there's  anything  wrong  with that  you know  I'll do  the funny  thing  okay  alright  I won't  even try  tell me  about  what you  think  his legacy  will be  as a comedian  many people  many very  famous comedians  say he 
[01:19:30]  really wrote  the book  well  I think  his legacy  for me  and for  many performers  I think  his legacy  will be  that he  had a style  a great deal  of class  and he  had a charm  about him  that's beyond  belief  and I'm sure  the kind of man  he is in heaven  right now  he's looking down  and saying  why are they  making a fuss  he was so  embarrassed  with something  like this  to talk about  his death  I'm sure  and when I  meet him  which will be  someday  I'm going to  straighten him out  what are you  going to say  to him Don  I'm going to say  you got on my  nerves  the football game 
[01:20:00]  was on  and we had to  do a memorial  to you  but I loved  him  and I miss him  and what do you  think  you know  you said that  he is someone  who is very  very modest  and I think  that really  came through  the TV screen  that he really  was deeply  a shy person  I think that's  one of the reasons  why he was so  endearing  but what is it  that you think  he would want us  to say  about him  in other words  we all want to  leave some sort  of legacy  would he want us  to celebrate  his sense of  humor at least  well believe it or not  in my opinion 
[01:20:30]  I think he would  say don't do that  I think he would  like us to laugh  and kid around  about him  but I don't think  he'd like us  to be serious  saying he's gone  and poor Johnny  and he was sick  he wasn't that  kind of guy  I think he just  wanted God to  put him where  he's supposed to be  and that's it  and make God  laugh for a while  but he certainly  didn't want to  fuss about him  and as I speak  now I just hope  that somehow  he hears me speak  and I know  Johnny  we all loved you  and wherever you are  you'll keep him going  but he was the last 
[01:21:00]  guy to say  hey give me some  accolades  he wasn't at all  like that  we had a reporter  say tonight  I think rightly so  that we missed him  even before he was  gone  what will you miss  about Johnny Carson  Don Rickles  his soul  his caring for my  wife and I  and his great spirit  when I was on the  show  and how he always  always made me  look like a champion  he was something  else  people in the  business  and the public  used to say  it was an event  when I went on  because he himself  made me look like 
[01:21:30]  beyond belief  and no one  no one can replace  that  I'm certain that  if he can hear you  tonight Don  he would be glad  to hear you say  such a good thing  anyone would  thank you so much  Don Rickles  may God be good  to him  God  if he can hear you  I'm sure he can  hear you now  if he can hear you  just when she  tried to be funny  this is everything  that's wrong  with women  and humor  and she said  you know  it's a good thing  you're not buying  curtains  there's anything  wrong with that  yeah she's got 
[01:22:00]  to say that  if you two were  gay it's fine  yeah why  curtains are fine  curtains are fine  alright well  Don Rickles was  nothing wrong with it  was really funny  on Larry King  last night  that was a  more serious  Don Rickles  yes  reflecting Anthony  reflective Don Rickles  on the life of  like how we nailed her  Johnny Carson  let me do the jokes  there honey  sweetheart  I'll do the funny  I'll do the funny  Pat  it's fine 
[01:22:30]  it's fine  yes we'll all miss  Johnny  sure  alright Anthony  we got lots of  other things to do  really fast  because we were  talking about it  last week  remember there was  the weatherman  that got fired  fired  the Martin Luther King  comment by accident  yes Martin Luther King's  birthday  he said something 
[01:23:00]  very inappropriate  and they gave him  the boot  it was an accident  but  well  we don't know  I think  they said they  speculate that it was  a slip of the tongue  I haven't heard the clip  well we got the clip  but regardless  slip of the tongue  on purpose  out  it's Rob Blair  from KTNV  he was doing  the forecast  and he  slipped  badly  the next couple of days  temperature is going to stay  well above normal  after a couple of days 
[01:23:30]  well below normal  here's a look at your  extended forecast  for tomorrow  sunshine  60 degrees  Martin Luther King  junior day  we're going to see  temperatures in the low 60s  and mostly sunny skies  look at that  as we head toward Wednesday  Thursday  and Friday  an unemployment day  as I head toward  the unemployment line  as I head toward  Kinko's  that was a slip of the tongue  it was obviously a slip  that was a slip  but you gotta wonder  where  that was in his head 
[01:24:00]  that it slipped out  like had he been saying  that earlier  around the water cooler  the water cooler  you know  let me hear that again  it's definitely a slip  the next couple of days  temperature is going to stay  well above normal  after a couple of days  well below normal  here's a look at your  extended forecast  for tomorrow  sunshine  60 degrees  Martin Luther King  junior day  we're going to see  temperatures in the low 60s  and mostly sunny skies  look at that  as we head toward 
[01:24:30]  Wednesday  Thursday  and Friday  whoops  whoopsie  whoops  out the door  that's a rough one  so that guy was  not only fired  he was  so fired  so completely  and thoroughly  fired  so fired  didn't know what hit him  he knew he was fired too  because after the forecast  he goes  well the jig's up  fired again  fired  so fired  fired  fired 
[01:25:00]  fired  he went on  like the 6 o'clock news  and then the 11 o'clock news  and apologized  but  I guess didn't do him any good  it's obviously a slip up  yeah  it seems like he had  the word cool  in his head  he is a weatherman  you think  yeah I mean  why it would fit there  I don't know  but  I think it's that  ooh sound from Luther  and you kind of get it  you know you're ahead of yourself  you get ahead of yourself  perhaps  Martin Luther  cool  I think he wanted to say  cool afterwards 
[01:25:30]  and he  I don't know  yeah  well regardless  doesn't matter  he's fired  I'm sure it's running  through his head  as he's trying to  find another job  there's no way to back out  of Martin Luther Coon  you can't  you can't say that on television  and go  well you know  what I meant to say  doesn't matter  what you meant to say  what came out of your mouth  that's a rough one  alright  Noah's walking around  in the pink teddy now  yep  can he  he's still wearing the  can we get him  out of the girls clothes  where's the intern  that I sent 
[01:26:00]  far away again  he's getting your bagel  is he out of here  he's been gone  well you can talk  on mic eric  yeah  Ben would know  he's been gone  yeah Ben would be  right on that mic  yep  well we're playing  intern run around today  what's the next thing  we need  coffee  yeah what do we need  last time we did this  coffee  the intern practically cried  you're gonna need more coffee  oh you better  yeah I'm gonna need  a cup of coffee  another cup of joe  okay good  alright and  Anthony we should  we should play  Rick's song here  oh my god 
[01:26:30]  what a dope  our old producer  Rick  who's now producing  the Hot 97  morning show  here in New York City  by the way  a lot of people  wondering  we have no problems  with Rick  we just moved on  and he moved on  he actually moved on  first you know  he got a gig  with the boys  down there in Philly  for a while  and then he moved  back to New York  and he signed up  with Hot 97  to produce their  morning show  and we wish him  the best 
[01:27:00]  kind of hard to sit out  two years  you know  you gotta move on  yeah we understand that  and whatever  I mean we're doing fine  he's doing fine  and he's in the middle  of some controversy  over there  at Hot 97  just a little  as soon as I  as soon as I heard the song  I'm like it's a Rick song  got Rick written all over it  Rick wrote this thing  it's obvious  we have been privy  to many Rick  song parodies  and  they're all a bit  over the top  yeah for our  new listeners out there  the old listeners  understand Rick  our old producer  would give us some 
[01:27:30]  give us some  over the top bits  from time to time  remember his  baseball one  do we have that  I don't know  maybe somewhere  is it online  maybe Foundry  or something  OAVirus.com  maybe though  OAVirus  OAVirus.com  will post maybe  some of Rick's  over the top bits  the baseball one  was just the most  despicable racist song  ever  and it was  Rick is always like this  he'll write something  as you're going  through  we'll be joking  on the air  we'll be talking 
[01:28:00]  about something  and Rick would just  chime in with something  so over the top  and bad  things that we were  touching on  being subtle  surrounding it  letting the audience  draw the conclusion  and Rick right between  the eyes  just bam  would hit you with it  the keyword is subtle  how about being a little  subtle with this  and then he was known  as the guy that was  pretty much over the top  with his parodies  and things like that  so  he wrote a song  I'm just assuming 
[01:28:30]  he wrote it  he wrote most of this  I'm thinking  maybe he didn't  but he's definitely  one of the singers  in this song  he's singing in it  and  it was a song  about the tsunami  yeah  and I guess  very insensitive  and I guess  there's a lot of people  pissed off  and it made some of the  papers in New York  a lot of outrage  aging groups  very outraged  and I guess the latest  is that the whole  morning show  decided to donate  a week's salary  it was either this  or get fired  they were told  they were pretty much  told to donate  a week's salary 
[01:29:00]  to the tsunami victims  tsunami relief fund  yes  huh  to the tsunami  relief fund  yeah  so  yeah  the victims  don't really need  the money  now do they  no  no  I'm sorry  Anthony  that was a  that was a slip up  there  so you want to hear  Rick's song  or you want to hear  the whole break  yeah  because the break  starts with the  whole show  arguing  like there's one  girl  that's involved  with the program  that didn't want  any part of this  and is kind of 
[01:29:30]  offended by it  I think  and didn't want  to be involved  and then  and wanted to make  it perfectly clear  to the rest of the crew  that look man  this is not my thing  I'm not into this  which is perfectly  reasonable  you don't want to be  part of it  that's fine  but then the chick  that's like  running the show  what's her name  Miss Jones  Miss Jones  Miss Jones  is just all  pissed off at her  and really coming  back at her  and I see no reason  for it  but you know  she gets that  neck going  really lays into her 
[01:30:00]  and it turned out  she was right  the other one  was right  not to be involved  because now  they're in a little  bit of trouble  for this  sure  the more I listened  to it  the more I was  happy Miss Jones  was yelling at her  just because you  knew this girl  was just like  I don't really  even though she  explained herself  well  Miss Jones  just had enough  of this little  PC bitch  it was really  starting to hammer  and I kind of  enjoyed it  I don't know  I don't like  Miss Jones  in this exchange  she's not likable  yeah she's really  not likable  you just know  by hearing that  even though it's  on the air stuff  you just know  behind the scenes  there's a lot 
[01:30:30]  of yelling going on  and it's her  a lot of the time  yeah  she's got an attitude  it's obvious  so you want to  play the break  then you said  yeah let's hear  the break  and then we'll  hear the song  all right  Dr. Jeff  yes  as usual  hey  it's been a pleasure  always my pleasure  I haven't heard  the tsunami song  but I would love  to hear it myself  all right well  I would  now is as good  a time as any  starring the Miss  Morning  Miss Jones  in the morning  show players  yes  minus Miss Info  of course  okay that's it  damn it 
[01:31:00]  why don't you  just quit  why is it  always minus you  why are you  doing like  everybody else  I'd show  stop the song  that song is  really offensive  to me  and I opted  not to involve  myself  but why do you  always have to  like if you feel  that way  then why are you  even on the show  like you always  have to separate  yourself  because I support  the fact that  all of you guys  have the right  to say anything  that you want to  and make fun of  anything that you  want to  and I understand  that especially  in a tragedy  that's one way  that people deal  with things  but for me  personally  I just felt  that I needed  to opt out  of it  because me 
[01:31:30]  personally  I couldn't  deal with it  that way  I couldn't  make fun  and while  we all  respected that  because I don't  think anybody  was knocking  your door down  to come and  ask for your  vocals on the  song  wait I'll let  you finish  let me finish  please  why do you  always have to  make it known  that you're  separate  I feel like  you always  no you do  you do  you always  make it known  that oh  I don't feel  that way  even a celebrity  drama  it's always  oh  well I don't  feel that way  it's not always  a question 
[01:32:00]  of if you  agree or not  just give  the damn  gossip  but I think  you're a  journalist  right  everybody else  gets to say  their opinion  can I say  one thing  just a minute  Envy  you can say  after I'm  done  Envy  oh what a  bitch  I'm talking  over here  I'm talking  let me finish  I'm talking  I'll tell you  what though  the more I  listen to Miss  Jones  the more annoyed  I got that  other girl  because even  though the girl  gave a very  rational explanation  like you know  what you have  the right to  make fun of it  I didn't even  catch it  I mean  she's like  minus me  like that little 
[01:32:30]  bitch  she just had  to go  I'm not involved  she had to  say that  beforehand  maybe she had  a little foresight  yeah but Miss  Jones is saying  like if you don't  agree then why  are you even  working on this  show  and I think  I think a radio  show where  everyone just agrees  all the time  stinks  true  you want a little  interaction  you want a little  heat  you want a little  disagreement going on  right  yeah I just think  she's the type  that always would go  I don't really  I don't want to be  involved with this  I don't really  she's just the type  that would just  kind of mush out  of everything funny  she's backing out  of it  she's backing out  of it because  she sees trouble  I think  I think she's 
[01:33:00]  very perceptive  yeah but her  explanation was  very rational  but this song  is hacky  at best  it's hacky  so maybe she  just didn't  want to be  associated with  something that  was kind of  just hacky  no one's knocking  your door down  for vocals  god why could  she sing  the rest of them  can't  yeah the vocals  on this song  is absolutely  all horrendous  that's not what  you look for  when you listen  to a song  parody on a radio  station  I understand  but she's  claiming that  no one was  knocking her  down for vocals  they're just  showing Jay Leno 
[01:33:30]  on his appearance  on the tonight  show  wow  he had like  big afro  going or something  alright here we go  the rest of this  info's not always  about all of our  opinions  but you don't  you always make it  seem like  you're separate  if you want to  be separate  be separate  go all the way  there  be separate  and be off  you're misunderstanding  of course I am  but I'll tell you  what  let's make it clear  let's make it clear  from here on out  you don't have to  you don't have to  be a part of it  no I'm trying to 
[01:34:00]  no you're not  you're not  you're always trying  to undermine  everything that's done  here  that is so ridiculous  okay well you guys  have a nice day  we appreciate you  we appreciate you  riding with us  and you have  of course  of course  because it's the real  can I say one thing  what  this portion of  Ms. Jones in the  morning is sponsored  by Sprint PCS  brought to you by  Sprint PCS  I don't feel that way  I was out of it  who cares  nobody's asking  you always trying to  put our asses out  of the line further  than yours  no I wouldn't say that  yeah well you can't  do it but that's  what your attempt is 
[01:34:30]  anyway  have a break  very healthy thing  from a psychological  point of view  right and I  like I said I respect  that but it's bigger  than when we  but it's bigger than  the tsunami song  it's bigger than  the tsunami song  it's every time  there's an artist  asked to be kissed  or an artist  asked to be put out  there you opt  you want the  invitations to the  parties and to the  this and that  so you don't even  do the job the way  it needs to be done  because you have  a different agenda  I intend to  I take it the way  it's given  and I'm not a damn  fool and I know 
[01:35:00]  you feel you're  superior probably because  you're Asian  but you're not  you're not  I know it is ridiculous  the fact that you  could be superior  I would never say  have a good day  thank you  and tomorrow  when I say  how many stories  to be done  in celebrity drama  please follow that  thank you  Dr. Jess  sorry you had to be  here while family  is fighting  but it is what it is  but next time  just really say  how you feel  please  exactly  that's what I try  to do  always  always  even when it's  not necessary 
[01:35:30]  if I was there  mics would have  been off  I'm going to be  at the club tonight  no it's not  always necessary  well actually I do  by my time  you know what  how about this  how about this  I'm going to call  you now on the warm  line  let's necessary that  let me and you  deal like that  let's do it  you guys have a  great day  and I'm glad  you notice how  many times  a guy has tried  to start the song  anyone else  listening in the  background  and then you can  hear him stopping it  like oh boy  I want you to have  the same heart  that you're having  now  okay  this is Hot 97 
[01:36:00]  your official  number one station  for hip hop and R&B  it's 955  we'll definitely  see you tomorrow  I'll send my  some of us  well  Jesus  well the girl  had to say  because I'm Asian  how does that  not make you  want to spit  in her face  how many funny  Asian women  are there  none  well she obviously  is not trying  to be funny  she's just a  she's like  the entertainment  reporter  yeah yeah  J-Lo is at  this club  and she was  seen with  this person  she's the 
[01:36:30]  entertainment  reporter  she's Asian  and the other  the host there  Miss Jones  is pissed off  at her  because she's  not  she doesn't  want to put  herself out  there  as the rest  of the show  does  by doing  maybe these  controversial  things  not that she  was trying  to be funny  but it just  figures that's  her take  on humor  like I'm  Asian  so I don't  appreciate that  and then she  backs off  a little coward  I guess she  got a personal  stake in  the tsunami  thing  and you know  it's kind  of affected  her more  maybe than  the others  because she 
[01:37:00]  is Asian  and that area  was ravaged  by the tsunami  so perhaps  she didn't  want to be  involved in  this  was a little  more offended  by a little  more sensitive  I would think  an African  American woman  like Miss  Jones can  understand  something like  that I'm  sure there  are certain  things that  she's more  offended by  based on her  race than  other people  would be  good point  but the Asians  should still be  walking on  someone's back  and then giving  them a hand  release  stupid idiot  you contribute  nothing  not one  funny Asian  woman in the  whole country  an Asian  woman has  never made  anyone laugh 
[01:37:30]  you don't like  what's her name  Margaret  show  oh she's  terrific  flat ass and  big tits  what a dish  like a smack  of fat  expressionless face  we didn't say  do you find  her funny  I mean find  her hot  no I don't  think she's  funny  no  alright  well here's  Rick's song  finally  here it is  a lot of  controversy over  this little thing  a lot of  controversy  not much  comedy though  see if you can 
[01:38:00]  identify Rick's  voice  a lot of  controversy  over this  song  yeah  no I love  the kids  there was a  time  when the sun  was shining  bright  so I went 
[01:38:30]  down to the  beach to catch  me a tan  then the next  thing I knew  oh way  twenty feet  high  came and  washed  your whole  country  away  and all at  once  you could  hear the  screaming  chains  and no one  was saved  from the 
[01:39:00]  wave  there were  Africans  drowning  little  Chinaman  swept  away  you could  hear God  laugh and  swim  you bitches  swim  so now  you're screwed  over the  top Rick  it's the  tsunami  you better  run or  kiss your  ass away  go find  your mommy  I just 
[01:39:30]  saw a  blow by  a tree  went through  her head  I thought  all black  people could  sing  what happened  will be  sold  child's  livery  so now  you're screwed  it is a  tsunami  you better  run or  kiss your  ass away  go find  your mommy  just offending  me  I just  saw  her  blow by  a tree  right  through 
[01:40:00]  her  head  and  onion  took  the  soul  child  slavery  so now  you're screwed  so now  you're screwed  it's a tsunami  it's a tsunami  you better  run or  kiss your  ass away  go find  your mommy  can't find  my mommy  I just  saw  her  float  by  a tree  went  through  her  head  and  now  the  children  will be 
[01:40:30]  sold  in  child  slavery  oh no  please have the kids  I'll pay for all the kids  the little indonesian kids  the little asian kids  the chinese kids  the black  well not the black kids  but the white kids  the puerto rican kids  I love them more  I'll pay for everything  I promise  I won't touch them  bubbles come on  let's get these kids  I love the kids  to save the world  let's please save the world  please help us out  tsunami  we're coming to help you  all you kids  we love you  wow  all that needs after it 
[01:41:00]  is a fat guy going  you know  I thought it was funny  oh boy  I know a girl  Sue wants tsunami  threw it out there  would it have been  out of the question  to have some of that rhyme  just a line maybe  rhyme with another line  nothing  and you can picture  Rick singing  you know he had his eyes  closed and he was  holding his headphones  like he was really 
[01:41:30]  at the session  yeah  tsunami  yeah he's got to be  over the top Rick  even vocally  tsunami  alright Rick  well there's an update  from our old producer  right  I'm sure they're very happy  that they got some press on it  oh yeah  look what Greaseman said  there is a double standard  though as much as I'm all for it  you look what Greaseman said  and got fired  yeah  and you look at this  and there's no one  going to be fired over this  you don't think so  nah I don't think they should be 
[01:42:00]  I don't think he should have been either  but  I don't think so either  you know this is something  where black people  have to look at it  and go look  you know  you can't have a double standard  if you want to  allow people to do  what they do in humor  don't get pissed off  when it's you know  whatever  yeah but you know  you get that pressure  from the groups  you know  some Asian group  is really pissed off  at that song  do you think that  they're going to fire people  I don't know  you just don't know  this day and age  this day and age  yeah you don't know  I mean  you just don't know  everyone's so hypersensitive  they get this knee jerk reaction  at the stations now  at the corporate level 
[01:42:30]  not even at the stations  where they're like  what  what happened  I just read this  oh fire them  get rid of them  quick  damage control  mommy floated by  a stick went through her head  I know  that's a rough one  your child  will be sold  in child slavery  slavery  the worst part  of any song parody  I think  is when  you put the accent  on the wrong syllable  of a word  to make it fit  hey  slavery  dude what's up  with the ski mask 
[01:43:00]  that's nice  it's what  it's cold out huh  what's going on  nah I just got  Jimmy his bagel  and I had to wear this  because it's freaking  cold out there  where'd you go  I went to the  the deli  right across from  Carnegie  right next to it  oh wow  that's kind of far  wow  but there's good bagels  there though huh  yeah yeah  as long as it's not  how many blocks is that  like one and a half  it's not that big  really  it's a little further  than that  it's cold out there  and they're long blocks  I think right  nah I just kind of  got lost  I'm not familiar

[01:53:00]  Wham, wham, wham.  Oh, browsers just disappear on my computer.  How come they haven't fixed this yet?  What's the problem there?  I'm putting in a repair request.  For my computer over here.  I just want it fixed. 
[01:53:30]  I want it fixed.  Nothing works here.  Toolbag Johnson from New Orleans.  He writes, remember Rick's Muppets with AIDS song.  Christopher Street.  Do we have that?  How to get to Christopher Street.  Yeah.  Come and play, everyone.  Here is gay.  That's Rick's song.  Wait, which one is it?  Christopher Street or AIDS Muppet Show?  Christopher Street.  Christopher Street.  AIDS Muppet Show is another one. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, was that the follow-up hit?  Yeah.  Over the top, Rick, man.  Another example.  Gotta love the guy.  Really fast.  Our old producer, Rick, who's doing...  He's got balls.  Who's doing pretty well there at Hot 97.  At the morning show.  We're all gangsticking T in our age.  T-cells low, we got the HIV. 
[01:54:30]  It's a great way to lose some weight on our way to Christopher Street.  Dead in days, lesions all over my face.  Hound my angst and grab some A-D-D.  You can watch my life wither away on our way to Christopher Street.  On our way to Christopher Street.  On our way to Christopher Street. 
[01:55:00]  He was definitely funnier when he was working for us, man.  That's funny.  That's a great parody.  It's quick, it's easy.  There's a laugh in every line.  It rhymed, and it's vicious.  Yeah.  That was Rick's gay voice.  What was the Aerosmith one?  I'm so gay, I'm so gay, I'm so gay.  Yeah.  He had a few gay songs.  He had a lot of gay songs.  Better than think about it.  Very good.  I forgot about that little ditty, Anthony.  Hey, Rick.  Thanks for the reminder on the instant feedback there, tool bag. 
[01:55:30]  All right.  Anthony, you brought in the parents-to-child, parents-talk-to-child-about-sex thing?  Yeah, that's one of the many educational films I was going through.  You know how you're cruising around on the internet and you're just kind of, you don't  know how you end up at some place, but you're there?  It's kind of one of those situations.  I'm going around and I ended up on this film archive site.  They had everything.  You know, you want to see presidential speeches from the past and stuff from NASA and all just 
[01:56:00]  American history, world history, actually.  And one of these archives was educational and industrial films.  There's just a slew of them.  So I'm checking them all out and they had ones on perversion.  And there were whole films on how girly magazines and men's fitness magazines cater to the homosexual.  Don't let your child read these.  He can turn into a homosexual.  Very angry at the homosexual. 
[01:56:30]  And one of them was called Boys Beware.  We got to pull clips from that one.  It's a whole thing on how boys have to beware of homosexuals that drive around in cars trying to pick them up at the basketball court in the high school.  And they have these scenarios that play out and it's so funny.  Guy comes over and he offers a boy a ride home and the boy takes it and he gives him a gentle pat on the shoulder.  Leads the boy to believe everything's going to be okay.  And then, like, next weekend he was back at the school driving Billy home. 
[01:57:00]  He decided to ask him if he wanted to go fishing.  They went fishing the next weekend.  This is where he showed Billy some pornographic photography.  And he shows him pictures.  And before you know it, they were walking up into a hotel room together.  And he put his arm around Billy.  Oh, it's the excuse that the homosexual used.  If things happen, if things like this happen, be sure to tell your parents before it's too late. 
[01:57:30]  And you're led to believe that the kid takes it right up the keister in the hotel by the homo.  But how did he get him up into the hotel room?  He just talked him into it.  And he talked him into it.  And then the next scene is Billy and his parents with Billy with his head down walking out of the police station.  Not being able to sit down.  Billy finally told his parents.  Yeah.  And you just know he was ravaged.  What kind of good pedophile takes a kid out four times before he bangs him?  Oh, I know.  He was, like, dating this kid. 
[01:58:00]  What if it happened to a shallow grave after the first date?  Oh, God.  That was another one, which I guess ended pretty quickly.  A kid on a basketball court.  And his friends left.  And the kid wanted to play.  You know, Johnny wanted to play a little longer.  And this guy comes out and offers to play a game with him.  And it's just this big, oafish old guy with the horseshoe bald head and the glasses.  And he's playing basketball with the kid.  And he offers him a ride home.  And he goes, little did he know, he traded a little more time at the basketball court for his life. 
[01:58:30]  His life?  His life.  That's it.  This guy was thorough.  No dating and fishing for him.  Yeah.  This guy wasn't about waiting a month to see what the little boy had.  It's a hollow, hollow, shovel over the head.  Wow.  Yeah.  Well, those clips are coming.  And there was no distinction in this between homosexuality and predator pedophile murder.  It was just, they were all grouped together.  The homosexual will prey on children. 
[01:59:00]  So we got parents.  This is a little different.  This is parents being educated by these doctors on sex, how to tell their kids about sex.  And a lot of it is played out in scenario and conversation.  All right, the first clip is, Mommy talks about vagina.  Yes, she does.  Mommy, I want to ask you something.  What is it, dear?  I know that the baby goes inside you, that's where Johnny was, but he seems so big. 
[01:59:30]  What I wonder is, how does he get out of there?  Your belly button, it's too small.  Mary, the baby doesn't come out of your navel.  Let me tell you how it is.  Oh, boy.  There's a special opening just in front of the place where you have your BM.  It's very, very tiny and a little girl.  It's a special opening right in front of the hole that you have your BM. 
[02:00:00]  Your Big Moody from My Bodyguard?  How funny is that?  And you'll notice later in life that because you have that, it's the only reason men talk to you.  It is a special hole, isn't it?  Yeah.  Because it's a special hole.  Just in front of the place where you have your BM.  It's very, very tiny and a little girl, but as you grow, it grows too, right along with the rest of you.  A slut.  Until when you're grown up, it gets to be just about this size. 
[02:00:30]  Now, when the baby's ready to be born, it stretches up to be about this size.  Just big enough for the baby to slip through, head first.  Then after the baby's born, it goes back to its regular size.  No, it doesn't.  Do you remember how big my tummy stretched when the baby was growing in there?  Only if you have a good doctor.  And now, see, I'm flat again.  I'm back to my regular size.  Do you understand?  Why does Daddy beat you?  But if I forget it, you can always tell me again. 
[02:01:00]  Maybe when Tabby has her kittens, you can see how they come.  I like that, but there's something else.  How did the baby get started in this?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Daddy comes home drunk from the office, smelling of whiskey, and flips Mommy over.  Remember that special hole I was talking about?  Daddy doesn't treat it that special.  He makes it a BM, a bloody mess. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah.  The special opening that little girls have, the one I told you about, has a name, the vagina.  Aha.  Now, you know that little boys like our Johnny have a penis.  You see his penis when we change his diapers. 
[02:02:00]  Yes.  When a boy grows up and is ready to be a father, he is able to put his penis into the vagina, that special opening that mothers have.  And when he does this, he can plant the seed that starts a baby to grow.  Isn't this little girl a little too young to know this much?  It's very wrong.  It is very wrong when you watch it.  The kid's much too young.  Shut up.  Go outside and play.  The mother's leaving out the whole foreplay thing. 
[02:02:30]  The whole good stuff.  Always hold the bag, honey.  You know?  This mother stinks.  Ha ha ha.  An awful lay.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Put it in.  You just know she lays there.  Now, put it in my special hole, dear.  Plant your seed.  Oh, God.  I'm going back to my secretary.  You stink.  All right.  The next clip is about masturbation.  Yes.  Hmm.  Let me, at this point, make a clear-cut scientific statement. 
[02:03:00]  Masturbation is not harmful.  The young child often plays with his genitals.  And after puberty, masturbation is a common release mechanism for the sex drive.  Growing boys will either masturbate to get rid of this energy or have a nocturnal omission,  the so-called wet dream.  Since sexual fantasies or dreams often accompany these experiences,  the teenager will sometimes feel guilty or ashamed.  What he needs right then is reassurance from his parents that they know these things happen  and that the experience itself is not harmful to health or to normal growing up. 
[02:03:30]  Not important at all.  It should be viewed as just a passing phase.  That lasts a lifetime.  You add to guilt by terrifying the teenager with fables and myths  or by giving the impression that the genital areas are evil or taboo.  These misstatements and misconceptions are the real danger.  Writing a song parody?  Taboo.  Is he doing a radio show with Anthony? 
[02:04:00]  Tell him it's okay to put it wherever he wants.  That's creepy, man.  Yeah.  Thank God he wasn't teaching me that crap.  No.  Who's listening to that guy about masturbation?  Ricky's back with Jimmy's Bagel.  Oh.  All right.  Let's bring Ricky back in here, our intern, our new intern.  I'll hand a little out of this one here.  How'd you do, Rick?  Ricky, how'd you do?  Well, you got to get on mic. 
[02:04:30]  You went back to that other deli?  Yes.  Oh, good.  I got to change and everything.  Not toasted bagel?  Not warm.  Give Jimmy his 20 cents back, please.  All right.  Put that in your pocket, Jimmy.  Cool.  All right.  And what's the matter?  Nothing.  It's good.  What, do you have a hot bagel?  What's wrong, Eric?  There's no cream cheese.  My bagel is, like, burnt.  Oh, boy.  How do you know it's burnt? 
[02:05:00]  You didn't even open up the package.  You know how hot it is.  Nothing on it.  No cream cheese.  Did you want cream cheese on your bagel?  Yeah.  All right.  Sorry.  I'm not going to share his cream cheese.  Yeah.  Don't worry.  It's just Eric.  He's a little man on a total pole.  You don't have to go back out.  These guys understand.  If, like, one of these guys would have gone out, they know exactly what everyone wants at this  point.  I think the training process is a little rough here, but, you know, it's something everyone's  gone through.  Jimmy?  I just want coffee. 
[02:05:30]  I'm fine, man.  Yeah.  Bring the coffee in.  And you got the bagels good?  Yeah.  He didn't get the coffee when he was getting the bagel?  No, I think he did.  Yeah, he did.  Jimmy said, you know, coffee for everybody.  Where is it?  Huh?  Outside?  By the chess board?  I don't remember him mentioning coffee.  Oh, no.  We can play the tape back.  Didn't you say coffee, too, and you asked if I won one?  Can we play back that part of the show, or no?  It would be too tough. 
[02:06:00]  All right.  Dirk's going to find it.  Yeah, we asked for coffee.  I don't want any.  Yeah.  I don't drink coffee.  Jimmy, can you do without coffee, hopefully?  No.  I've been up since yesterday.  I've been up since last night at 5 o'clock.  I slept all day yesterday, and I woke up at 5, and I'm trying to stay up today so I can  get my schedule back by going to bed tonight, which I have to do.  Well, the coffee's in...  What?  That's just across the street, right?  Starbucks, yeah.  Oh, Starbucks.  Play it, Starbucks.  Okay.  Where is it? 
[02:06:30]  Huh?  Starbucks is right next door.  Well, he forgot, Jimmy.  It's all right.  He's new.  I want...  Let me jot this down.  I have to get that down.  You're here.  Yeah, you better write it down.  Just give me a tall coffee.  I'll give you a little extra here.  Keep the 30 cents for yourself, all right?  Tall coffee with milk, not cream, please.  All right.  It's no big deal.  It's just across the street.  I want a medium ice...  Huh?  No sugars?  No, I got the Splenda over here.  That'll be nice.  Medium iced latte with skim milk, please, buddy. 
[02:07:00]  Thank you.  This is four.  Just whatever's left over from his, just use it to finish up that one.  Well, you want the change back, though, I think.  No, no, I'm saying it's going to be more than four.  It's like 4.30 or 4.20.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, make sure you don't use any of your money.  That's not cool.  Yeah, just use the extra 30 cents.  All right.  Medium iced latte with fat-free.  Coffee?  Um, no.  No.  All right.  Ricky, sorry.  Sorry.  I know we said it, though, on the air.  Sorry for it.  All right, there goes Ricky, the new intern.  He's heading out for, I think, the fifth time now to get food and coffee and bagels and stuff like that. 
[02:07:30]  He's gone?  You are awful, Jim.  Why?  Jimmy, right when, like, I noticed he was almost smiling, like, oh, boy, are they sending me out again?  Is this a gag?  Jimmy puts on this face that completely made him wipe his smile off his face.  You put on this face like, you know, oh, no, I've been up all night.  Like, he's getting pissed off.  And the kid just, like, the smile went right away from his face. 
[02:08:00]  Okay.  Pulls out his little pad.  I'll write it down.  Got to get it right.  Oh, that's funny.  All right.  Well, there you go.  So, it's intern runaround today on the program.  We do this from time to time.  All the other guys are relieved that it wasn't them.  They're all like, whew.  All right, Anthony.  So, back to the...  Funky Treasure says, sometimes Daddy puts it where Mommy has her BM.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, these films are really funny. 
[02:08:30]  What is BM, by the way?  A bowel movement.  Oh, okay.  I don't know.  That's an olden days term for going to the bathroom or taking a dump.  BM.  A BM.  Or making poo-poo or poopies, as they tell the kids these things.  Toolbag Johnson from New Orleans writes, doesn't BM stand for bend movement?  Old gravy leg.  Dear, it's the special hole right in front of the place that makes you have gravy leg. 
[02:09:00]  You're going to need club soda when Ricky comes back because we're running out of things to do.  Getting a little short.  All right.  So, the next clip is the doctor talking about wet dreams, I guess.  Is this...  We really want the homosexual audio.  Oh, yeah.  We'll get to that.  That's on the way.  This is great stuff, though.  I love this stuff.  I get a strong sex surge, and the only way I can take care of it is to masturbate.  And when I do, I feel awful.  It's just like I've committed a crime or something.  And it worries me, and I say, well, I won't do it anymore. 
[02:09:30]  And when I do, it goes away for a while, and I come back and do it again.  And when I do control myself for a while, I end up with a wet dream.  Well, Jimmy Norton, what you have to do is calm down.  You're a sex addict.  Gee, like I committed a crime, Beef.  I know.  It sounds like leave it to Beaver.  You know, Wally, I was playing with myself last night, and I felt like a creep. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, don't worry about it, Beef.  Mom has to wash my sheets every hour on the hour.  I'm jerking it all the time.  Well, me and Lumpy went out behind in the house in the woods, and he was all lumpy in his pants.  And I won't even tell you what happened to Whitey.  It was all Whitey in my face.  It sounds like, because it is from the same time. 
[02:10:30]  I mean, it's in the 50s, so they get these whiny little kids.  Oh, and I didn't know what I'm doing.  Just grab it, crank it, and go out.  Have fun.  Next thing you know, I'm feeding a hooker a bran muffin, laying underneath her yelling,  Bombs away.  I felt like a creep or something.  It's okay to take logs on your chest.  Don't be embarrassed.  All right.  I don't think I can do this.  Hold on. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, man.  Cool.  Beaver!  Beaver!  Gee, I hope Dad doesn't come up here and catch me spanking the monkey, Wally.  Oh, it's okay.  Dad does it all the time.  Mom doesn't like getting it in her special hole in front of the place she has her BM.  So, is this how you do it, Wally?  Sure, Beeb, just grab on and crank away. 
[02:11:30]  Everything will be fine.  But what if I make a mess?  That's what Mom's for, Beeb, to clean up our mess.  Sure, Beeb.  The men in the house make messes everywhere, whether it's in that special hole or on the  sheets like you boys.  Mom will clean it up, because that's her job.  It's the 50s.  She's there to clean up our sexual fluids and to take my punches in the face when I'm pissed 
[02:12:00]  off from a day at the office.  Now, crank away, kids, and don't worry about the laundry.  That's Mom's job.  She also cooks a mean pot roast.  Ah.  Isn't it nice to have someone to clean up your fluids and make a nice roast at the end  of it all?  It's the 50s, and it's wonderful.  It's great.  The 50s just seemed so great.  Everyone was stupid.  If you missed the 50s, move to Toronto. 
[02:12:30]  They're still living it.  Are they?  Oh, my God.  Hey, I want to talk about masturbation, eh?  A boot.  Put a boot in your dog's liver.  What's this swimming naked clip?  Oh, well, they're just discussing things, Sophie.  The adolescent boy has other problems, too.  I'm talking about his problems in growth and development, which can be as disturbing to  him as his sex pressures. 
[02:13:00]  Boy, how do I always get the top locker?  Two boys in the locker room.  The junior team you're on looked pretty good today.  You guys better watch out.  You might make the finals.  Yeah, but we'd be a lot better if I were bigger.  I'm sure getting tired waiting to grow up.  It's no fun being such a scrawny kid.  It may sound funny to you, but...  Boy, when I change my pants, I like to crawl in that locker I feel so undeveloped.  That's not so funny. 
[02:13:30]  Before we moved here, I used to go to a school where we had to go swimming in the bear.  I was so embarrassed about the size of my penis that we used to dread the days we had to  go swimming.  Even though it was my best sport, I was good at it, too, like you.  Boy, what I wouldn't have given for a fig leaf.  For a big shawl.  Well, how do you think I feel?  He's got a little dick.  That is so funny.  What school is he going to where they swim naked?  Dude, we did this...  We talked about stuff like this in the past, and a bunch of people came out of the woodwork 
[02:14:00]  saying that they were forced to swim naked in high school.  Unbelievable that that was actually going on.  They would swim naked?  Could you imagine?  Gee, Dad, I feel a little embarrassed going swimming.  I feel like a creep or something.  I get in the pool and I got a little slung.  That's okay, Beaver.  I had a little slung when I used to go swimming, but look how big and thick and fat it's gotten.  Whoa, Dad, put that away. 
[02:14:30]  That's what your mom says right before I put it where she has her BM.  And then she just says, ouch, ooch.  And she has to wash the sheets again.  That's her job, you know.  You know, Dad, sometimes when you go to work, Eddie Haskell comes over and Mom makes the same  sounds in her bedroom that she makes when you're in there.  Well, really?  How about that, Beaver? 
[02:15:00]  Eddie Haskell's becoming quite a man.  You know, someday, those girls at school are going to want you to put it in the special  hall.  And that's when you flip them over and put it in their balloon knot.  What's a balloon knot, Dad?  Well, blow up a balloon, tie it in a knot, and look into where you just blew.  What does that look like?  Oh, I get it, Dad. 
[02:15:30]  The place where the BM comes from.  Sure.  Sure it is.  God, the 50s rocked.  Wish I was there.  Do anything you want.  Here you go, dude.  Everything was in black and white.  Hold on, hold on.  Let's go to Mike.  Hey, Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  We used to swim naked in school.  Told you.  Naked in school.  All right, so you're what?  You're 60 years old?  36.  I'm 36.  I'm 36.  Where were you swimming naked? 
[02:16:00]  We were in Cheektowaga outside of Buffalo, New York.  That makes sense now.  And what would they say?  What was the first day you had to do this?  What was that like?  It was like, what the fuck?  I got to get naked and swim with fucking 30 guys?  And the teacher just said, take your clothes off?  Yeah.  They did not give us bathing suits, and we weren't allowed to wear bathing suits because  they said that the soap clogged the filters or something like that.  Yeah.  And I know a lot of guys who all had to do with the same thing, and I mean, it was fucking 
[02:16:30]  weird.  And once I got into high school and stuff, I was like, I ain't doing this anymore.  I mean, what the fuck?  You play chicken with fucking a naked sack on your neck?  You know?  Fuck that.  Jesus.  All right.  Well, there you go.  I told you, Ant.  I didn't know that was going on.  The logic of it is crazy, but...  This day and age.  Mike in Jersey.  What's up, Mike?  Hey, what's going on, guys? 
[02:17:00]  Hey.  Hey, you really pulled a boner this time, B.  Wah, wah, wah.  Yeah, some words take on different meanings.  We had this great naked Reco-Roman wrestling when I was in school.  Don't be such a baby.  Stop it.  They did not.  I'm just joking.  Yeah.  Take care, guys.  You never know, though.  They did in the older days do that.  Not, like, really older, but in school they would have the kids wrestle naked.  Come on.  Ugh.  No way.  I read that.  Mac, what's up?  In one of those homosexual magazines. 
[02:17:30]  Opie Opie, kill the vet, man.  They're new sponsors.  Huh?  Oh, yeah.  Kill the vet.  It's a new sponsor.  Problem.  Very funny.  Very good.  That's very funny.  Sure.  Hey, Ricky's back with the coffee.  Cool.  That was fast.  Thanks, bud.  Oh, my God.  Coffee.  Cool.  Thanks, man.  Is it cold out there, bud?  It's not bad.  It's not bad, right?  It's up to 11 degrees now.  Let me see if, uh...  Excellent.  Where'd you get the, um, seltzer?  Oh, this is perfect.  Dice dip.  Daily downstairs?  Right downstairs? 
[02:18:00]  Mm-hmm.  That's not that far, right?  No.  I should have told you if you were going for coffee.  Could you grab a, um, can of seltzer, please?  Sure.  Thanks, man.  Hey, Ricky.  What's up?  You're doing such a good job.  Here's, uh, 5, 10, 21 cents.  You tell Ty Webb I'm gunning for him.  There you go.  Nice.  Perfect coffee.  I need this.  Here you go.  Ant?  Yeah, I just need a...  Seltzer?  Yeah.  A little club soda or seltzer?  Wow.  Do you get club soda?  I don't know if they have clubs. 
[02:18:30]  I prefer the club soda, to tell you the truth, as opposed to seltzer.  Seltzer stinks.  But, yeah.  See if you can find some club soda.  So, the seltzer's like, meh, meh, meh, you know.  Ricky, thanks.  Yeah, that audio is really, it's like, you know...  Don't forget it's club soda, right?  Okay.  It's like from the old days, it's just so completely, just so completely dated.  Yeah, yeah, dated.  A few seconds, just... 
[02:19:00]  As they're walking.  My nose, right?  Yeah, it's just really old stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  What is old?  What?  Just outside the audio, you can see what old...  Oh, my God.  Well, I'm making...  No, Ricky's outside, he's a little confused, because he heard club soda and seltzer.  Yeah.  No, club soda's the way to go.  Yeah, club soda.  Whatever one he brings, you gotta say, you want in the other one.  Of course I do.  Ah!  Still there?  Yeah, I think so. 
[02:19:30]  Because Eric is a dummy.  They should just turn the audio down.  Yeah.  Out there.  The boys' club always had nude swimming.  Not sure if they do now.  Was it on out there, though?  No, it's on.  Oh, it's on.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay, good.  So whatever he brings back is gonna be the wrong thing.  It's gonna be the wrong thing.  Okay.  All right, what in?  So we're back to this? 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  If you're just tuning in, we're playing Intern Runaround today.  I think he's up to five or...  I don't even know anymore.  This is, I think, his sixth trip.  You don't have to act.  Out into the tundra.  Eric's all mad.  I'm like, you don't have to act.  He's gone.  What's the matter?  It was supposed to be a salted bagel with cream cheese.  It's plain with nothing.  Uh-oh.  It's a cream cheese bagel with salt.  All right, Anthony, the next clip is about menstruation.  Ah, menstruation.  There's been a real change in our approach to education about menstruation. 
[02:20:30]  It's hard to believe what grandmother experienced, but let's hear her story.  There's grandma talking about it.  I'll never forget when I was 14 years old, I went to the little outhouse on our farm.  My new dress was stained and there was blood on my underclothes.  Uh-huh.  Hey, really, granny.  Sounds hot.  Did grandpa put it where you be him?  Or maybe it was read from slaughtering an American Indian, you rotten old bag. 
[02:21:00]  We had just returned from a lynching when I noticed I was bleeding.  The front of my underpants looked like I was attacked with a bingo splatter.  Old copper panties.  Oh, God.  All right, wow.  Blood on my underclothes. 
[02:21:30]  I ran inside and showed my mother.  And all she said was,  You're menstruating.  And turned and walked away.  I had to find out how to take care of myself from my cousin.  Were any of your girlfriends told in advance by their mothers?  No, I'm afraid not.  They were just as scared as I was.  Laura Ingalls.  Laura Ingalls.  All of them.  And some of the mother's sisters who told them.  One thing I was sure of.  I would never let this happen to my daughter. 
[02:22:00]  Why do you suppose your mother didn't tell you in advance?  Ignorance.  Just plain stupid ignorance.  Oh, calm down, Granny.  She's got some mother issues.  No kidding.  I remember.  And then this young Union soldier came by my house.  And he had fired a shot.  It went through his testicles.  It hit me in the ovary.  And I was pregnant.  You can read about me on UrbanLegends.com.  What's .com?  I have no clue.  It's the 50s. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, my big bloomers just stained.  That just sounds awful.  Disgusting.  That's funny, though.  I was dirty.  Well, here we go.  A little discussion about sanitary napkins.  Ah, here you go.  Mommy, what's this?  Well, I guess, honey, you're old enough now to understand these things.  She's one.  Those are sanitary pads for me, honey.  Yeah, really.  Mommy, what's this? 
[02:23:00]  Well, here you go.  He takes his big schlong.  Let's start over.  Hold on.  Okay.  Come on.  Mommy, what's this?  Well, I guess, honey, you're old enough now to understand these things.  I don't understand these things.  Those are sanitary pads for me, honey.  You know that mothers have a special place inside them where the babies grow before they  come out? 
[02:23:30]  Well, each month in a grown-up woman, a sort of soft, nesty place builds up.  Soft, nesty place or nasty place?  Nesty?  A soft, nesty place.  That's how she's describing her womb.  It's the 50s, though.  She should be describing the outside of it as nesty.  Nesty and nesty.  Looks like a vulture's nest out there.  You just know it's big and awful.  No hygiene going on down there.  And a grown-up woman, a sort of soft, nesty place builds up. 
[02:24:00]  And some of the nest is blood.  And if a woman is going to have a baby, she needs this nest for the baby to grow in.  Now, let me tell you what it's had you for.  If no baby has started there, then the blood in the nest isn't needed.  And it just dribbles out of the vagina for a few days.  Sometimes mommy sneezes and stains the linoleum. 
[02:24:30]  That's awful.  Do they explain crime scene sex?  Dribbles.  No, no.  No.  And then a fresh new nest place starts building up.  That's what the pads are for.  To catch the blood.  Does it hurt?  It shouldn't.  It's something that happens to every girl when she grows up.  Now have a lucky.  You're old enough.  Light up a lucky.  Pop away, dear. 
[02:25:00]  What are you now, two?  Here you go.  It's lucky children's cigarettes.  Smoke for your health.  Now included with your dolly, a pack of lucky stripes.  Soft, nasty, nasty.  A lot of great instant feedback coming in, by the way.  Big dog from Texas.  Ben didn't want to swim naked because his dong would drag along the bottom. 
[02:25:30]  Unfortunately, I can't do impressions, but Funky Treasure from CringeHuber.net.  Did you read this one?  I'm not sure.  He writes this a lot every morning.  Wally, I saw mom make a BM on dad's chest last night.  Gee, Wally.  And then J-Mac.  I don't want you to get scared by what you saw last night, Wally.  Dad, it was kind of creepy. 
[02:26:00]  Gee, Dad, I saw mom squatting over you.  And she was having a BM on your chest.  Now, Wally, although on the outside this might look odd, it's quite pleasurable when mom drops logs on my chest.  Oh, sure, we've done that ever since college.  It might stink a little, and, well, I don't tell the boys down at the office about it, but it's perfectly normal. 
[02:26:30]  Maybe when you're out on a date, you could have a girl drop logs on your chest or face if you're a real trooper.  You know, it started years ago when I used to play Monster Rain with some of the boys in my neighborhood.  Monster Rain, Dad?  Sure, Wally.  That's when you yell, Monster Rain's coming, and run under the porch, and all of a sudden we fillet each other.  Ain't the 50s great? 
[02:27:00]  Gee, I'm going to go play that with Eddie Haskell, Dad.  Sure, you go run off and play.  Monster Rain.  And grab a couple of Luckies on your way out and puff away.  I love a lucky strike.  And striking your mom.  It's the 50s, you know.  So did we play the sanitary napkins one, sort of?  Yeah, right?  Yeah, yeah, we got through that one.  And then J-Mac from Philly writes, 
[02:27:30]  Why does Ann have to tell everyone he isn't taking part in the gag?  Why does he have to separate himself from the club all the time?  I'm offended by it.  All right.  Ann talks about her period?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, let's get this one out here.  A little period talk.  Come on.  Ann, when did you first learn about menstrual periods?  Oh, I really can't remember.  I just always sort of seem to know something about it, and I knew that I'd have them someday. 
[02:28:00]  I do remember, though.  I knew that I'd have them.  Like, I don't know where this accent is from, but it's horrible.  Nothing sexy about this.  I knew I'd have them.  Yeah, yeah.  When I started to develop, my mother reminded me that I'd probably be starting soon.  And that's when she went into the sort of information that you gave in the animation.  Not as clearly as that, but I felt I knew what the score was.  And then she did a very practical thing.  She gave me a belt and a pad, and I was all set. 
[02:28:30]  A belt and a pad.  Most of my friends' mothers didn't do it this well, though.  Among my friends, it really ran the gamut about what they knew and what they didn't know.  A belt and a pad.  Ah, the good old days.  You had to buckle up like a fighter pilot when you have your period.  With a Gucci belt buckle.  We ought to give pads and belts for them.  For Noah.  Have him wear that around the office.  A belt and a pad.  A pad and a belt.  Nice.  Any ithers? 
[02:29:00]  One more?  No one ever mentions that you can wear two pads on a heavy day or that tampons are all right, even if you aren't married.  What is that about?  Well, you didn't want to put anything in there if you're not married.  Because then if you have a husband who's checking you out, you know, some husbands would actually check out the woman and make sure she's intact.  And women were afraid that a tampon would break that and make her look like a slut to a husband who's searching for a virgin.  Hold on, we've got to interrupt the show. 
[02:29:30]  Oh!  Ricky's back.  Ricky, we're in the middle of doing a bit here.  Ah!  Seltzer, my friend.  Club soda?  Club soda.  There wasn't club soda?  No, they're doing it.  Hold on, what?  We've got to turn your mic on.  Oh, boy.  What?  No, there wasn't any club soda over there.  I was looking around the store for a while.  That's why it took me a little bit.  Yeah.  See, I'm on a low-sodium diet.  Do you see 25 milligrams of sodium in that?  Club soda has no sodium.  That's the difference.  It's still bubbly water, but, you know, one or two is fine, but three? 
[02:30:00]  Seltzer stinks, dude.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I'll keep it here or something, but, you know.  Ah!  Get a buck.  Eesh.  Oh, my God.  This is, like, wasting the whole show today.  Yeah, you know.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry, dude.  I should have, I don't know.  Maybe I told you.  Rick, do you think you're cut out for this gig?  You're killing me.  I'm trying my best.  I'm trying to do what I can.  There you go.  Yeah, club soda. 
[02:30:30]  You keep that.  You keep that.  I don't even know where we were.  All right, let's start the whole bit over again.  Oh, boy.  You want to replay the audio or shoot?  I don't know.  Eric, did you interview him before we hired him?  Hired him to be an intern?  He seemed reliable.  Holy ass.  The audio's off out there, right?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I feel bad.  I can't even do this. 
[02:31:00]  Don't separate yourself from the group, Anthony.  I can't help it.  He's going to spit in your club soda like Kizzy.  I know, right?  You did say club soda, though.  He's gone?  Yeah.  Club soda, seltzer.  It's no difference.  I don't care.  It's not called seltzer water, can he?  And you're trying to say how you can't drink seltzer, and there's an empty one right next to you.  Just three of them next to me.  Yeah.  If I have to worry about 25 milligrams of sodium.  All right. 
[02:31:30]  What do we need next?  We're running out of things.  We need things.  Things?  Things.  Did he get your apple today yet?  No, I didn't.  All right.  Very good.  Well, this he could probably really screw up.  All right.  I think he's going to come back with a nice crisp apple.  Don't even say it's crisp.  I won't say that word.  Okay.  Dude, and then throw it against the wall when he comes in.  Please.  Dude.  Throw it against the wall.  Even if it's crisp.  And walk out.  Yeah, and walk out.  And walk out of the studio.  All right.  Please.  All right.  Here's another clip. 
[02:32:00]  He's not going to come back with a crisp one, by the way.  Of course he's not.  Of course he's not.  It's going to have the consistency of something you find in a dumpster behind a Planned Parenthood.  This is great.  Should this have two little eyes in it?  Little Malfoy ears?  Anthony, here's another clip on...  Apple of Dad's Eye.  Here's another clip on Anne's period.  Apple, why would you bring him a computer?  Monarchy. 
[02:32:30]  All right?  Yeah.  All right.  No one ever mentions that you can wear two pads on a heavy day or that tampons are all right,  even if you aren't married.  The fact is, a lot of girls do get cramps in the first couple of days, and I know then  I'm limited for some sports.  You mean that what you really needed to know is that menstruation is a nuisance, but not  something terribly unpleasant.  To guys.  Oh, I don't know.  But after a few periods, a girl becomes very aware of some of these nuisance factors. 
[02:33:00]  Really, they're just inconveniences for the most part.  Of course, it's nothing like my mother's day.  Not nearly so restricted.  You should hear my mother laugh about her high school gym class.  Yeah.  All the ladies who were having their periods had to get in their gym suits.  Then they sit along the sidelines, radiating their attainment of womanhood and smugly enjoying  their female-ness, while the rest of them whack the volleyball.  Whack the volleyball.  Ugh.  What an accent. 
[02:33:30]  Pids.  I wear pads.  That is weird.  That is weird stuff.  They're all whacking a volleyball, and mom and her other friends are just there bleeding  against the wall.  Bleeding against the wall.  That is disgusting.  Big, thick, double pads on there.  Dribbling out.  Looks like Dracula with Down syndrome. 
[02:34:00]  Dracula.  Sometimes I'd have to wear two pads.  It was pretty disgusting when I had to put on two pads.  It's like I was wearing a diaper.  You know, a bloody diaper.  You should tell your children about this so they're not embarrassed.  What an awful accent that was.  Sometimes I wish I'd be sexually active, but not with this accent. 
[02:34:30]  God damn it.  I'm banging Sipowitz over here.  Hey, come on.  Put it in my ass.  Come on, you lousy scale.  That's horrible.  Oh, how cute.  There's Katie doing some sledding this morning on the Today Show.  Hit a tree.  Leaving a red stripe down the mountain.  I'm having my period.  All right. 
[02:35:00]  Let's go to the phones and say hi to Greg real fast.  Greg, what's up?  Greg?  Hello.  Greg?  Hold on, hold on.  Greg?  Don't forget to send them out for the unfrosted Pop-Tarts.  Make sure they're unfrosted because they're harder to get.  Yeah, the brown sugar Pop-Tarts.  Very good.  Yeah, my blood sugar level is getting a little weird.  Let's say hi to Seth.  Hey, Seth, what's up?  Hey, guys. 
[02:35:30]  What's going on?  Hey.  I went to a boarding school up in Newburgh called Storm King.  They had three awful nozzles in the shower.  No separation.  Just three nozzles.  And I don't know what the water was up there, but all these guys had these huge freaking hogs.  And I'm sitting there with just a medium-sized normal guy.  It was horrible.  It was horrible.  I was in ninth grade.  Were they all retarded with those big hogs?  Did they all look like Ben?  It was like Ben, these big black penises just all over the place. 
[02:36:00]  It was really traumatic.  Were they all right?  That old lady on that clip is probably Lady Di.  Punch it out.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  There you go, Seth.  All right.  We should step aside and take a break.  Well, are we going to get the homosexual clips?  Is Steve still working on those?  Homosexuals.  All right.  Steve's working on the homosexual clips.  Yeah.  That's great.  That was all they had back then, education.  You don't see those anymore.  Do they still even play stuff like that in school?  They have to update it. 
[02:36:30]  We're so PC now that everything's got to be just right.  So I think they would just opt not to make these anymore.  Yeah.  I don't know.  They're damn interesting to watch.  I was watching some.  I didn't bring in any, but on wartime propaganda and some of the films back then.  They had this film that was about the Japanese during World War II, and it was supposed to  be a Japanese guy talking.  It was an American guy dressed up in makeup like a Jap, and he's like, let me tell you  about my Japan. 
[02:37:00]  We are working the war effort to beat you, America.  And it was just the most racist, hate-filled thing I've ever seen.  It was great.  Where's our propaganda music that we were playing last week?  All right.  You know some of these things are directly responsible for the A-bomb being dropped, because  they went into like, you know, so send your people over.  We will fight to the last man.  There are millions of us here in Tokyo and all over Japan that will fight. 
[02:37:30]  We will never stop.  Send your waves of soldiers over.  We will beat them.  We will kill all of you.  And it's got to be like, geez, this guy sounds serious.  Why don't we just drop a huge bomb from the sky and kill them all?  You know?  And as you land back on the safe runway of your base, you can light up a Lucky Strike cigarette.  Yes, when that match lights and the end of your lucky glows, think of the glowing Japs in  Hiroshima, writhing in pain and radiation as you draw that fresh, clean tobacco taste of 
[02:38:00]  your Lucky Strike.  And know when you go back home, the Japs will be sitting in internment camps, never to annoy  you with their funny faces.  Light up a Lucky Strike and celebrate America's victory over the animal Japanese.  They aren't really human, you know.  When you burn them out of their caves with your flamethrowers, use that last spark to light 
[02:38:30]  a Lucky.  Yes, American troops, smoking Lucky, being Lucky.  Lucky Strike.  Every Lucky you smoke stands for a dead Jap.  Lucky Strike cigarettes.  Mmm.  I ain't got nothing on.  That's right.  That was funny.  My tank ran dry.  Well, with that, why don't we play a mashup and take a quick break and we'll continue. 
[02:39:00]  Steve is getting the homosexual clips together.  Ah, the dreaded homosexual.  It's Green Day and Oasis.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  Next on Satellite Radio.  I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known. 
[02:39:30]  Don't know where it goes, but it's only me and I walk alone.  Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you.  I walk this empty street on the boulevard of broken dreams.  Where the city sweeps and I'm the only one and I walk alone.  By now, you should've somehow realized what you gotta do. 
[02:40:00]  I walk alone.  I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now.  My shadow's the only one that walks beside me.  My shadow heart's the only fear that's beating.  Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me.  Till then I walk alone. 
[02:40:30]  Every day I wake up at it's Sunday.  My heart's the only one that I am is going.  My baby's always playing on each one.  My heart's so lonely all the way.  Backbeat, the word is on the screen that the fire in your heart is out. 
[02:41:00]  I'm sure you've heard it all before, but you never really had a doubt.  I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now.  I'm walking down the line that divides me somewhere in my mind.  On the borderline of the engine where I walk along. 
[02:41:30]  Today's gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you.  Read between the lines what's up and everything's alright.  Check my vital signs and know I'm still alive and I walk alone.  Today's gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you.  I walk alone, I walk alone.  By now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do. 
[02:42:00]  And all the roads we have as you walk are winding.  And all the lies I need is there a blinding pain.  There were many things that I would like to say to you, but I don't know how.

[02:47:30]  it was so horribly done  one girl in the class actually passed out  saving us from the rest of the video  how does that happen  is the girl saying the blood will come out tomorrow  the blood will come out  your vagina  bet your bottom dollar  next to the place where you gotta be in  that's classic  sure  annie  number one  my hair wasn't red this morning  let me tell you a little story 
[02:48:00]  oh  uh  more about that  let's see  okay  are we there yet  was the number one movie in america  over the weekend  what's  oh that one  awful  with the cube  and it got horrendous reviews  didn't it  with ice cube  oh yeah  one star  one star made 18 million dollars  i guess people really needed to go to the movies over the weekend  jay moore's in it  i went to the movies over the weekend anthony  and what'd you see 
[02:48:30]  one of these  hugely popular movies  well maybe someone could help me out  i uh  i read a couple reviews  and i love this actor  and uh  actually there were  a lot of actors in this movie  that i really really enjoy  so i said  eh  sure why not  i went and saw life aquatic  why  you saw that in the movie theater  with bill murray  and uh  owen wilson  and uh  willem uh  defoe is in it  uh huh  cate blanchett  yeah a bunch of people  and uh  and uh 
[02:49:00]  i sat there  for the two hours  and um  i don't really know what i saw  and it's getting really good reviews  so i'm starting to think  i'm really just stupid  yeah  i really don't understand what i saw  at this point  i asked you what the movie was about  i really don't know  i i think wes anderson  i think he  it's another one of uh  his movies  i think this guy should be assassinated  at this point  stop throwing these movies out  out there at us  did you ever see the royal tenenbaums anthony  yep  what was that movie about 
[02:49:30]  i have no clue  didn't get it  don't care about it  rushmore you almost got  he wrote that as well  almost  and uh  i think he was  the village  did he write the village  no  did not write the village  and i think he also wrote  uh bottle rocket  which was the movie  that made owen wilson a star  which was kind of cool  i just hate owen wilson  really  you do  he looks like every guy  that has ever banged a girl  all this day  and yeah i hate him  hate him  really  well you have a reason then  yeah  well life aquatic  saw it  okay  i don't know 
[02:50:00]  well the genre alone  should tell you something  action adventure comedy  sci-fi fantasy  that's what genre it is  does that make sense  i guess  how about we just make it a comedy  okay  how about we just make it a comedy  wes  no action adventure comedy  sci-fi fantasy  wes who has to be too cool for the room  internationally famous oceanographer  steve zissou  bill murray 
[02:50:30]  and his crew  set sail on an expedition  expedition to hunt down  the mysterious elusive  possibly non-existent  jaguar shark  that killed  zissou's partner  during the documentary  filming of their last adventure  so that's the movie  yeah  they're joined by a young  airline co-pilot  who may or may not be  zissou's son  owen wilson  a beautiful journalist  kate blanchard  assigned to write a profile  of zissou  and zissou's estranged wife  and co-producer  angelica houston 
[02:51:00]  they face overwhelming  overwhelming complications  including pirates  kidnapping  and bankruptcy  i guess  some of the scenes were  funny  yeah  but the movie in general  i'm like what are they  getting at here  what are they trying to say  you saw this huh  yeah  well because i was  you know reviews  were coming in saying  oh you gotta see this movie  it's great  i saw a trailer for it  and had no ambition  to go see this  well i love bill murray  man bill murray's just  i loved bill murray  yep  and 
[02:51:30]  you didn't see lost in translation  yeah but that wasn't  did you like it  it wasn't a comedy really  true  i just like uh  pretty much everything  that bill murray's in  he does a good job  i wasn't watching that movie  for bill murray  that's for sure  no  well i don't know  scarlett johansson  yeah she was  just absolutely  stunning in that movie  she's the hottie du jour  right  i don't know  i didn't like that movie  either  lost in translation  no  i wanted to like it  because it was like  kind of different  but it was just about  a boring guy  who hangs out  with a boring chick 
[02:52:00]  and they don't bang  it was like  well that's my life  i don't need to watch  him do it  andreas  or andre  or uh  or whatever your name is  who's this  oh andre  how you guys doing  what's your name man  james  what's happening  james  really  you're spelled  james  a-n-d-r-e-a-s  especially you  you know  the critics  they're always the worst guys  you know  they don't know  what's good movies  you know  they fall for suckers  when there's a bunch  of top name actors  and they're always  oh it's a great movie  it's a great movie 
[02:52:30]  always the worst  royal tenenbaums  terrible movie  i haven't been to the movies  take it easy  alright  i wasn't listening to you  i haven't been to the movies lately  so i'm thinking  you know what  i think i need to go to the movies  yeah but why go see that  because i went to my local theater  and that was playing  and i'm like  alright  i heard this movie's pretty good  i like bill murray  i'll go see it  that's why  it was the movie  that just happened to be playing  when i walked into the theater there anthony  i want to go to  rottentomato.com  because i should have went there  because they give all the reviews  for all the movies 
[02:53:00]  it's the best website  as far as getting movie reviews  they take all the main newspapers  across america  throw all the reviews up there  and then  then you could like gauge  if it actually is going to be  a good movie or not  figure it out  yeah because you know  the new york times  could give life aquatic  four stars  and then uh  newsday or the post  could give it one  so you know what i mean  you gotta average it out  you gotta average it out  which this website does  um  did you see ray  huh  no  did you see ray  you did  i loved it  yeah  i loved it  i didn't see it 
[02:53:30]  i really did  that's another one  i want  you know something  i it has to be some  the movie  if i go to the movie theater  has to be  that you have to see it  on a huge screen  which only  to me is only like  action adventure type movies  anything else like ray  i'll wait till it comes out  and watch it on television  i don't have to see those  big  jimmy fox teeth  or whatever his name is  jimmy fox  here you go  jimmy fox teeth on the screen  wow their teeth are 10 feet tall  i love this  but you know you see an action movie  you want to see  you want it big and loud 
[02:54:00]  ray  it was good though  i really  i didn't want to like it  as much as i did  i hear it's good  i'm just pissed that he's in something  that is getting critical acclaim  because he's awful  i'll rock your world  that's who he is  wow  he's shenaynay  wasn't that  yeah  a wanda was the girl's name  yeah wanda  he played the character  oh is it  i'll rock your world  all right  then he comes up and does this  you know  and gets all critical acclaim  for a dramatic role  really fast 
[02:54:30]  uh  are we there yet  which is the number one  movie in america  just proves it's just a bunch  of dopes in america  yep  uh  the rating is 10%  eee  basically on  rottentomatoes.com  yeah  that means you get  you take all the reviews  across america  and this movie got  10% good ratings  or good reviews  i should say  and uh  and this review says  doesn't even have  the wit to be  energetic  funny  or humane  in route to being  inane  irritating  and corrosive 
[02:55:00]  corrosive  how is something  corrosive  these people get  really pissed off  when these reviewers  get really pissed off  when they see  uh  an awful movie  thank you sir  what do you get  i have  canada dry  club soda  nice  all right  there we go  look at ricky  all confident  handing his uh  anthony his money back  you keep that yourself  oh  oh  give him a dollar tip  look at that  i'm good like that  ricky where'd you go  you've been gone for like  20 minutes for a stupid  what what are you getting 
[02:55:30]  club soda  club soda  not seltzer  oh club soda  and it's icy cold  where'd you have to  just from the walk back  where'd you have to go  to get it  no i was looking around  some stores  i couldn't find any  club soda specifically  and i know you wanted a bottle  but i only found like  the big one liter bottle  but the bottle's all dirty  had black shit on it  and all of that  oh  so i just went to the  pizzeria down the street  here and just got it  oh the pizzeria down the street  now we know where to get it  yeah  well thank you sir  wash the can top  you gotta wash the can top  don't drink out of it  it's filthy  oh boy  never drink out of a can top  it certainly is  i could see that 
[02:56:00]  yeah just uh  just wash that off warm  and it should be all good  yeah you can't drink out of  a dirt off warm  oh yeah yeah  that that'd be good  yeah  thank you ricky  thanks man  you're making a comeback  because we were talking about  uh letting you go  but it looks like you're  doing better now so  oh my god  you got him bad  oof  that is just awful  let's see  i feel so bad  i don't want him to wash  the top because he might  spit on it  i always spit on it  all right anthony  i found uh 
[02:56:30]  the reviews for  washing it in the bathroom  he's probably gonna use  his own urine  he's gonna wash it  wash  all right here's the problem  i had to go wash the can  here's the problem  okay  life aquatic on  rotten tomatoes dot com  which is that  you really gotta check out  this website before you  go see a movie  okay  yeah  um 140 reviews anthony  fresh meaning  you know the reviewers  liked it  70  rotten  70  it's right down the  middle  that's the problem  that's the problem  uh smug and slow 
[02:57:00]  moving who cares about  steve zizuzu  for anderson it is all  about the boat  whatever that means  i don't know what that  means  i didn't see the movie  your whimsy tolerance  will be tested in this  movie  i don't think i have  whimsy tolerance  what is it  i am intolerant to all  whimsy that crosses my  path  i don't like whimsy  i hate reviewers that  have to be too cool for  the room  they all do  i hate whimsy americans  san francisco writes  though it looks like a  wes anderson film it 
[02:57:30]  doesn't feel like one  next time try not to  play kowtow to your  whimsy  wasn't that what mr  marshall said to ralph  something like that  when he sat on in mr  marshall's seat and he  walked in and he goes i  just want to see what it  was like to be the boss  well next time try not to  play kowtow to your  whimsy  mr marshall what a prick  boss  yeah  hors d'oeuvres  hors d'oeuvres  yeah whimsy  yeah it's what happens  when it's uh you know  the wind blows it gets  whimsy out  whimsy  i don't have any hair to 
[02:58:00]  mess up  um anthony  here's the cream of the  crop of the uh reviewers  village voice writes  it's a collage of half  measures  it's a collage of half  measures  what the f does that  mean  who said that  the village voice  the village voice says  it's a collage of half  measures  what  well collage means that  a bunch of fags read  this magazine so let's  use a word they'll like  i never went to  collage  why is ricky back in 
[02:58:30]  the studio  um i washed a can of  club soda  thanks ricky  thank you sir  all right uh boston globe  the film's meta fey title  alone is an example of  why some people adore  anderson and why he  drives others absolutely  crazy  what does that mean  meta fey  m-e-t-a  dash  f-e-y 
[02:59:00]  meta fey right  what the hell does that  mean  i don't know  meta fey  i don't like reading  stuff to feel stupid  especially movie reviews  it's not like i'm picking  up a  book on physics  why did i read this  stuff i would have  never seen this movie  usa today  it's sporadic droll  moments temp one to  view it with a charitable  eye until patience is  exhausted by the end  that's exactly how i felt  my patience is  exhausted  i was finally exhausted  uh vastly disappointing 
[02:59:30]  an uneasy mixture of  characters and events  uh blah blah blah  all right  i can't recommend it but  i would not for one  second discourage you from  seeing it  roger ebert  good old roger  talking about the movie or  me vomiting  i would like you to go see  old pudding head  you know what i like  monaki over miami  wow daily news  all right we'll end 
[03:00:00]  with this  shoot the monaki  we'll end with this  life aquatic  if there's anything more  tiresome in film today  than hip irony  it is forced irony  and here comes a boat  load  all right  i should have went  there man  rottentomatoes.com  if you guys have never  checked out that website  for movie uh reviews  it's uh it's it's great  i just go with the flow  there's a big dopey  action movie playing  i go to the movies  and see it  everything else  i'll wait  i was pissed because  the village wasn't on  pay-per-view for me 
[03:00:30]  so i wasn't able to  see it still  i should have taken  jimmy up on his offer  and uh and taken his  dvd that he was going  to smash because he  hates the movie so much  still haven't seen it  it's ruined for me  i already know how it  ends but uh i still  want to see it for the  awfulness  awfulness of the acting  i just want to see  why why must you always  speak what is in your  mind  oh joaquin phoenix  stinks  why must you always  speak what's in your  mind  well why would you  always rumble what's

[03:04:30]  life aquatic no  yeah  is that good enough  huh  yeah it's aquatic  that's aquatic  that's really a  pronunciation  life aquatic  that's not really  you could say  aquatic  that could just be my  that could just be my  regional accent  right  that must be  i had some  some douche on the  message board  thank you mike  some douche on the  message board ragging me  about the way i say  finger  because i say finger  and he's from seattle  and he goes  dude it's a hard g  ass  he goes instead of 
[03:05:00]  tooling on opie  for pronunciation all  the time  why don't you uh  look at the way you  say finger  finger  how do you say i  never noticed  because then i say  finger  and then i guess in  seattle they say it  finger finger  where you say finger  and not finger  as one word  regional accent  of course there is  you ass  gotta take into  consideration  my god you should  have you should have  heard how i used to  talk being from  long island it was a  lot worse than this  take your finger  and put it where you  bm  right behind the 
[03:05:30]  special hole  yo pussy  uh let's see uh  big kev has movie  suggestions for  everybody  oh oh big kev  yo  what's up buddy  i i was just  wondering uh you  guys are talking a  lot about movies and  and there's a movie  out there that i think  you guys would like  particularly anthony  yes it's about a guy  who makes millions of  dollars in the  entertainment industry  he's really into uh  aviation aeronautics and  new technology and he  slightly goes crazy and 
[03:06:00]  neurotic about you know  germs and other  things and yeah i'm  wondering why you guys  didn't see that i  happen i think that  was a great movie i  would have seen if i  was at the movies and  that was playing it  wasn't playing that i  would see the aviator  the aviator i've seen  it twice it's great is  it that good really yeah  really is he i had no  interest in seeing it i  don't know why i like  him but i just didn't  want to see it life  aquatic aquatic aquatic  aquatic was the only  movie that was playing  at the time i walked 
[03:06:30]  into my local movie  theater kev and what  is that movie about the  life aquatic yeah it's  about wes anderson making  film with lots of people  that he's friends with  yeah no doubt man  everybody was in that  movie yeah i didn't like  that i'm so done with  wes anderson because  soon as the movie was  over it said written and  directed or whatever  wes anderson i said  that's why now i  understand now i  understand my lack of  understanding right the  royal ten of bombs what  the heck was that about  huh it's probably not a  good idea to go cold i 
[03:07:00]  read a i've read a review  it was in i don't know  the poster one of these  places you know maybe a  magazine and said hey  uh you know getting good  reviews and three four  stars murray uh murray's  excellent in this movie i'm  like all right i'll go see  it yeah now you guys should  definitely check out the  aviator honestly if i knew  it was wes anderson i would  not have gone and we will  see the aviator thank you  kev is that better than  ray kev i liked it better  than ray yeah as a biop  movie yeah i thought it  was much i think a good  movie movie would be ray  flying planes wouldn't that 
[03:07:30]  be funny he's all blind  moving his head around  where's the airport i'd  watch that all right yeah  all right you guys can  imagine ray flying a plane  you'd probably use a hanger  like the type i hang my  jacket on you know because  i'm big humps humps mmr  big bones body to match  paul from philly hey how  are you hey good paul um 
[03:08:00]  i just want to ask jim  wasn't that movie the  village weren't they  supposed to suck at  acting isn't that the  whole point because they're  like faking the whole thing  no i i would understand it  and say that was a good  point but when they were  talking among each other  they stunk um and it just  no one would do that no no  would be that subtle especially  with that cornball a point and  the fact that they were all  wearing costumes there would  never be that subtle a  distinction so no they weren't  supposed to  i don't know i i just thought 
[03:08:30]  i mean i thought it was  pretty obvious especially the  scene when that girl talks  about she got raped behind an  alley or her sister got raped  behind an alley i just think  nobody talks like that in that  day so they clearly had no  clue what the hell like how to  do what they were trying to do  but then but then again why  would they need to why would  they need to talk like that if  they were convincing people that  were never going to see the  outside world they were living in  the 1800s  yeah they were convincing  themselves too so like they  wanted to but they were like  role players you know like the  you know that's the whole thing  okay it still stunk and it was  still horribly acted  i totally agree with you it  sucked anyway it's just you know 
[03:09:00]  that m night shaman shit  trying to  and joaquin phoenix whispering he  really should have his face  smashed  great stuff thanks jim i saw you  in ysp i love you you're the  best thank you man thanks all  right big kisses thank you buddy  take care let's go to john in  new york city hey john john  what's up john hey listen uh  hotel rwanda dude don cheetle  from oceans 11  yeah that's the best movie i've  seen all year myself really yeah  the only problem is though you  got to i mean it's not in the  big theaters i mean i saw it 
[03:09:30]  downtown at the angelica so  limited release honestly dude he's  he's phenomenal you know there's a  movie out there i'm gonna get a  lot of abuse but i'll just throw  it out there anyway man because  we made fun of it on this very  program  two men in a java log  paul giamatti and uh sideways oh  yeah yeah  and we're like this movie just looks  like it stinks it must be very good  about a couple guys uh i don't know  drinking wine and uh traveling uh in  wine country and just i don't know 
[03:10:00]  like discovering themselves or  something it just sounded awful but  people are saying this movie's really  good and really funny that's what i  hear i saw sideways as well it was  very entertaining but paul giamatti was  very good but i forget the guy who  was there with him um he's the guy  that used to be in  yeah  but guys i'll tell you i mean hotel  rwanda i mean hollywood is going to  suppress it because it's about a  genocide and all of that yeah you  know it's i tell you don cheetle  promotion to level just he hit that out  of the park as jim would say he's 
[03:10:30]  phenomenal now sideways or sideways or  whatever the name of the movie is is  it good is it as faggy as we thought  it was  yeah i mean you know it's about wine  drinking for you know an hour and a  half but i mean he's had detainium  paul giamatti's a good actor you know  yeah  still doesn't  all right well  and what's that movie do you know  florentine told me about a movie it's  about a guy it's only playing in like  one theater in new york murder  something pieces it's like about a guy  who just kills hookers  wow  it's like a real sociopath i don't know  anybody's out there has seen it but  he said it was phenomenal 
[03:11:00]  what is it jimmy murder something  pieces murder death pieces or some  weird title  if anybody out there knows uh about  some guy just kills hookers  jim says the greatest thing he's ever  seen  i know i haven't seen it but uh kevin  kevin uh  kevin what  kevin's husband kevin bacon is  supposed to be very good in the  woods but i haven't  oh yeah that was supposed to be good  too another killer  that's another one of course it's not  going to be acknowledged because  it's about a pedophile you know  right well everyone's too busy uh  watching are we there yet

[03:12:30]  not like the old days  it's everywhere now  and the the means  that people can get it  it's so readily available  to the youth of america  and this is the 50s  and these people  are still babbling  the same crap today  same crap  uh  we gotta rewind  just in a second here though  well  well jim that movie sounds very interesting  let's go to the phones  uh rev  hello rev  rev  there you are  what's going on  i just  i know the movie jimmy's talking about 
[03:13:00]  it's called murder set pieces  oh murder set pieces  okay  i'll tell you  the director of this movie  he's a hack  he's  he's going on every message board  all over the place  and he's spamming the site  and uh  he's making it out  like he's uh  his own intern  or something like that  yeah  he's a joke  but the movie's supposedly  really good  it's like  x-rated  or nc-17  and like  and uh  all the people who make the  who um  process the films  they wouldn't do it  so he had to like  spend his own money for it all 
[03:13:30]  so it's pretty crazy  alright very good  thanks buddy  thanks for the info  alright  there he goes  is it crazy insane  or is it nuts  i do want to see that now  so you know what the problem is here  by the way  like it  on the same pot  is the cd player  oh i know  and a telephone  so you're pushing  he's like emerson lake and palmer  over there opie  i'm flipping buttons like crazy  to go from the cd to the  and i told mars  this doesn't work this way  it's just not  it's just awful  because now we might want to go back to cd  so now i have to do this  but if someone else  see but then you do that

[03:52:00]  how old you did it  for  i would say a few  months  a few months  yeah  what's a few  two  six  two to three  i would say  i know my last  relationship who was  with i know how  law i know what  broke us up  did you break up  with her  she break up  with you  um  it was kind of  mutual  i would  kind of  mutual  no you seem a  little nervous  because you're  doing a lot 
[03:52:30]  you don't be  nervous we're  just talking  about  her name  is judy  no julie  okay  julie right  yes  and you broke  up  uh  but you have  no idea  why  were things  going well  well  just kind of  lost contact  like stopped  calling  so  really  so you think  she might have  tried to break  up with you  and just kind  of let it  as possible  kind of ooze  away  it didn't really  hurt me that much  she was kind of  a really flaky  person  so  yeah  how long did  you date her  before you had  sex  oh god 
[03:53:00]  or didn't you  no i did  uh  i  i don't  ask me how  ask me how long  i dated my ex-girlfriend  before we had sex  okay how long  went down on the  first date  in the car  after she was  robbed at knife  point  in washington  square park  for coke money  really  yeah  true story  true story  it really is a  nice story  but i remember  all of them  i remember  how long we  dated  what are you  trying to say  jimmy  no no  i'm only 
[03:53:30]  maybe your  memory is just  a little better  than no one's  it's weird with  like all right  so julie  you've been  single for a year  you dated julie  for a few months  not too sure  how long  and you dated  like you dated  her for a little  while  who was before  her  who was before  her  thank you  thank you  thank you  switch the  gender  i'm not  switching the  gender on you  no i know you're  not  he's being a  smart aleck  he's being a  smart aleck  her name was  alex  yeah  alexia  no what was  the girl's name  before her 
[03:54:00]  before julie  girl's name  before her  yes  i'm not  remembering  really  yeah  i don't i  don't date  that much  that's why i  should probably  stand out  see if you date  a lot  the point i'm  making is if  you date a lot  and i'm not being  cruel i'm just  really helpful  no i understand  if you date a lot  then you probably  don't like like  if you ask me  what was the name  of this hooker  because there's so  many but if you ask  girlfriends and i  remember them because  there are only a few  yeah  you know what i mean  no i know  so you remember julie  but you're very vague  on the memory so who  was before julie  i didn't really have 
[03:54:30]  any serious relationships  really before that  no  no  no  so three months  and how long ago  was this  this was  about a year ago  a year ago  so for three months  a year ago  that was pretty much  your only relationship  that you've ever had  i wouldn't say my  only relationship  i ever had  but  who'd you lose  your virginity to  i lose my virginity  too  yes  good question  gosh  really putting me  on the spot here  why  mine was michelle  i was 18 she was 15  she is now overseas 
[03:55:00]  um  you know she moved  to miami after that  we dated high school  for six months  mine was christine  they called her buzz  in california  i was i think 13  she was 19  and uh  yeah it was  actually in my bedroom  while my parents  were out  mine was uh  bonnie  freshman year in uh  geneseo  yes i was a  late bloomer  anthony  and she had a horse  mane  a horse mane  she had that  oh she was the one  with the little row  of hair down  not a little  of her back  it was an inch uh 
[03:55:30]  inch wide  and went from uh  the bottom of her  back neck  all the way to her  her tailbone  was it wispy  like an intern mustache  or was it heavy  it was some weird uh  birth defect  that i didn't notice  until i turned her over  and i was horrified  yes  it's awful  so uh  noah you  it's very  all we're saying  is it's a thing  that as a guy  it is very memorable  it's a life memory  that you take  to the grave with you  it's one of those things  oh no doubt  you just remember  we've gone through  this with everybody  by the way  you're not alone  you're just a new guy
