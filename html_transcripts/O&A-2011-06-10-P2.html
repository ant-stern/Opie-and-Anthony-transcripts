<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a chaotic "After ONA Live" segment hosted by Sam Roberts from the cramped production room.  Opie and Anthony were absent, recording commercials, leaving Sam surrounded by staff including Liam (with a guitar), Bobo (a comedian), and Danny.  Conversation was dominated by the crowded, and arguably smelly, conditions, punctuated by humorous exchanges and observations about a football player inexplicably dressed in a tuxedo.  The unexpected booking of Loverboy was a major running gag. Sam openly expressed his dislike for the band, citing a recent negative encounter on Fox News.  The producers' decision to book them was met with disbelief and much joking, focusing on "Working for the Weekend," and their past MTV music video contest.  The segment included numerous prank calls, many mistaking the show for other channels, and discussions ranging from 80's music and personalities to Casey Anthony.  The segment culminated in Loverboy's arrival for a brief interview and performance, amidst the ongoing chaotic atmosphere.

Loverboy, featuring Mike Reno and Paul Dean, then had a full interview segment.  The discussion started with "Working for the Weekend," its lasting popularity, and its use in media like *Saturday Night Live*.  Reno shared a story about the song unexpectedly revitalizing a dull performance at a Vancouver Island bar.  The hosts persuaded the band to perform an acoustic verse of the song live in the studio.  The conversation continued to their music video for "Working for the Weekend," focusing on the drummer's expressive facial expressions in freeze frames. Reno attributed this to the drummer's French-Canadian background and passionate playing style. Finally, the conversation turned to their new song, "Heartbreaker," produced by Bob Rock.  Reno and Dean discussed the collaboration with Rock and concluded the segment with a live performance of "Heartbreaker."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  You think they can hear me?  Not them. I'm in the audience.  We are live.  Whoa, that was not a good sound.  I'm Sam Roberts. 
[00:00:30]  Opie and Anthony are still in the studio.  As is Travis and Roland.  Jim's not in there, but...  Opie and Anthony are.  Yeah, you're right, Eric.  I'm not.  I'm in the production room right now,  because Opie and Anthony are cutting some kind of commercial  that they're going to run on the traffic channels.  Why?  I don't know.  They're in there making traffic jokes as we speak.  Travis is going to wave me in when they're done.  That way I can run in.  And Anthony is interacting. 
[00:01:00]  Is that on the air?  You can't hear me if that's on.  Oh, sorry.  I was listening to them.  Whoa, I was...  Was I off the air for a second?  Was that...  No, they're still on the air.  I was just listening to the other studio.  Oh.  Was that in your head...  Was that in both our headphones?  Yes, but not on the air.  But we can't do that.  Okay, so Opie...  His headphones are off.  So you don't...  You have the monitor in here to watch them,  but I don't have the monitor to watch you.  Correct.  What happened to our monitor in there?  Mars broke it.  Oh, man.  What did I do?  I keep it... 
[00:01:30]  The mic was barely even plugged in.  I don't know what's in there.  There's Liam.  Liam, we're live on the air in here.  Why?  Because the Opie and Anthony are cutting spots.  We only have the one mic, so crowd around.  Opie and Anthony are there.  Yeah, they're cutting spots for the traffic channels.  It's like a zoo.  I can see them in there.  Who's that girl?  Oh, that's my intern.  Hello, Liam's intern.  How are you treating Jenna?  I didn't realize we were live in here.  You bet we are.  It's after Opie and Anthony live.  Hi, Anthony.  Waving to Andy.  He's waving back in the...  Travis, we're live on the air.  He can't hear me.  It's soundproof.  Of course not. 
[00:02:00]  Because it's radio.  Wow, okay.  Yeah.  Well, we're going to bring Loverboy back over in a little bit.  Is that true?  Is that cool?  Of course it's cool.  I just want to make sure I sent you guys the song in case you want to...  What's...  Yeah, I don't...  I mean, Loverboy...  I'd love to play the new song.  I'll have to go back and get it.  All right, we'll play the new song.  I guess Loverboy's going to be on the show later.  They're going to perform.  They're going to perform?  I'm going to ask him to sing.  Get a guitar.  That would be great.  We'll just put some mics in front of a guitar.  That's how we do things on After Opie and Anthony live.  Just throw in and sing your hit.  I guess somebody heard me... 
[00:02:30]  Who's that guy in a tuxedo outside?  He's a football player.  Why is he wearing a tuxedo?  I don't know.  I guess somebody heard me earlier in the show watching Loverboy on Fox News and Sirius XM  had their big signage in the crowd.  And now they're coming here.  This is weird doing the show from a production room.  I mean, there's really not a lot of interaction that can go on.  What we're in right now...  We have a separate room that's attached to the Opie and Anthony studio that's just for  phone screening, and it's where Eric runs the board from while the show is on. 
[00:03:00]  Unfortunately, as I said, Opie and Anthony are in the main studio, so we're stuck in here  in this little room.  What were you just showing me?  That's the football player that's here.  Donnie Jones?  Yeah.  Why is he wearing a tuxedo?  Who knows?  To be different.  How much commercials are they possibly doing for the Traffic Channel?  Do you want to pop them up secretly and hear it?  Can I?  Yeah, hold on.  Would I hear myself still?  Yeah.  Okay.  A little Alice in Chains.  Stay there. 
[00:03:30]  Just keep us in mind.  Maybe another day you could check us out.  I don't know.  But right now, stay right where you are.  Yeah.  That sounds like a commercial to me.  Nothing going on on our channel.  Well, there is something.  They're not talking about right now.  They're doing commercials for the Traffic Channel.  I think we went above and beyond the Call of Duty with this fucking copy.  Okay.  Are they done, Travis?  Can you hear me?  Can I go back in there now?  Now, if I go back in there, Urock, you have to talk for a couple minutes. 
[00:04:00]  Can I go in there?  Well, let's see where they're at.  XM105.  Oh, they're talking about XM106.  That is this channel.  The Opie and Anthony show is live.  Right now, Opie.  Right now.  You're in the studio.  They're live because I'm like, wait a minute.  Oh, yeah, I'm one of the guys, so how can I say they're live to these people?  Yeah, if we're live right now on XM105 Series 2.  Liam's got a guitar.  Liam's got a guitar, but it's an electric guitar.  Where are we going to plug it into?  Go bring it, Ant.  Oh, yeah, you guys forgot. 
[00:04:30]  Bobo.  I got a stand-up.  Bobo, what are you doing in here?  We're live on the air.  I forgot to mention, I do got a stand-up game.  So what?  There's only one mic, Bobo.  Bobo's in here.  Look who's in here, Travis.  Travis is in the other studio.  Get away, man.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Danny's in here now.  It's utter chaos.  Nobody can hear you because we're both talking at the same time.  Nobody can hear you.  $10 for what?  Where are you going now, Bobo? 
[00:05:00]  You need to use deodorant when you come into a small room like this.  You didn't.  You didn't.  You didn't.  Well, I did.  You didn't.  I did.  I smelled you from when you were right next to me and you didn't use deodorant.  That's his breath.  Does your breath smell like armpits?  No.  Well, then it was your armpits.  Wasn't it?  Are they done in there?  Let's find out.  That's good.  But we are live right now on XM Worldwide.  How much copy do they have? 
[00:05:30]  They're just doing the same commercial over and over again.  Management loves promos.  Well, tell management they should love live shows.  I'm not in my studio.  I'm off my game.  I'm going to try to get in there, though.  Wait.  Obi's walking away.  Are they done?  Okay.  You talk.  Eric, you talk.  Okay, go.  Drop the headphones.  All right.  Sam is leaving the producer's studio.  He is now running and they're locking the door.  Oh, he got through.  He's now in the main studio and they're blocking him from getting to the console. 
[00:06:00]  There we go.  He's turning the mic on.  Can you hear me?  Yeah, you're there.  I don't like these people anymore.  I got to go home.  Who don't you like?  Oh, what happened, Sam?  We were listening to some of your commercial, but not all of it.  Oh.  On the shit hour?  It's not the shit hour.  It's after Obi and Anthony.  Yeah, we're on.  You're on the air still.  Oh, let me see.  Oh, oh, okay.  We were broadcasting out of that little room.  Wow.  Well, the room is little because E-Rock's in it.  Ah!  See?  Wow, what's that joke?  Oh, wait.  It's not my show anymore.  I forgot. 
[00:06:30]  It's not my show.  So E-Rock could just chime in and give me some ribbing.  A little ribbing.  That room would feel like a gymnasium if he would just leave.  Oh, shit.  If it was a gymnasium, he would be leaving.  Because he's out of shape.  He's not going to work out.  He's not going to work out there.  That's crazy.  This is amazing.  The cleanup is going on as we speak.  You want your charger?  Yeah, I want my charger.  Well, then take it from me.  How cool is iced tea?  He was awesome.  It was the shiznit, I'd say.  The shiznit.  That's how, you know, it's said in the culture. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I don't want to speak out of turn here, but that Coco has an amazing ass.  Whoa!  Has that been said before?  It's pretty big.  That was the best part of standing behind her is she took pictures with everybody.  Oh, did you?  Were you jerking off?  I was just masturbating while she was taking pictures.  Yes, that's what I was doing.  Where's E-Rock?  Did any of my photobombs work out today?  Oh, shit.  Are you photobombing?  E-Rock?  Where'd he go?  How could he be lost?  What the fuck?  Where'd he go?  Where'd he go?  He knew he wanted to play some basketball. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, shit.  Back to the gymnasium.  All right.  Guys, I don't mean to make you jealous.  Yeah.  Why do I play him here?  Because he booked Loverboy on this show.  Are you shitting me?  Yes.  Wow.  How sad is your job?  We booked Loverboy on this show.  They're going to play.  Wait, Loverboy is playing on the shit hour?  Yes.  Are you kidding me?  Are you kidding?  I thought it would be funny.  You're not booking Gareth?  Yes.  That is fantastic.  I saw Loverboy on Fox News, and then Eric told me they're coming in and playing, right? 
[00:08:00]  I'm not fucking talking to Loverboy.  Holy shit.  If this was 1984, I'd talk to Loverboy, but get the fuck out of here.  Loverboy's coming in in like 10 minutes to play.  This is ironic because I'm going to be working for the weekend by leaving and getting in my  car and driving home.  Why?  Could you want to listen to Loverboy quick?  Did you guys really book Loverboy for this hour?  I told Eric to book them, and they're coming in.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Yes.  How easy was it to book Loverboy, by the way?  I don't know.  I think those were here from before.  Very.  They were more than excited.  Because they had nobody else here to interview them. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Usually it's like...  Why are you making this hour worse?  Yeah.  What do you mean worse?  With the Loverboy looking.  E-Rock's Paris Hilton picture sitting on the desk.  I brought this in, so if Ant wants to take this to the shooting range, he's more than  welcome to.  Oh, I wouldn't shoot at you like that.  Hanging up in the studio.  How funny would it be?  That's your dreamy eyes, though.  How funny the picture comes back, and you can still see Paris Hilton.  By the way, Bobo's...  It's a shooting range joke. 
[00:09:00]  Bobo's still here, and he's super pissed off that you guys didn't plug his comedy gig.  I don't know, Bobo.  He could listen to Loverboy.  He can't come in.  How are you doing Loverboy?  What do you mean, how?  Are they doing an acoustic set?  They're going to come in.  There's an amp right there.  They want to talk about their new single, and then they'll perform for us.  Whose guitar is that?  I don't know.  That's the company's.  That's not theirs.  Oh, that makes it even better.  No, Eric.  What are you doing?  We would blame that on E-Rock.  All right, have fun with the Loverboy.  You're not going to stick around for Loverboy? 
[00:09:30]  No!  Because we were talking about him this morning.  Remember?  And you said, you know, we said, wouldn't it be funny if Loverboy was in here?  Can I tell you exactly what I said this morning?  5.30ish in the morning, we were driving by, was it across the street?  Fox.  Fox, yeah.  And they had a stage set up.  You might have saw it on TV today.  Yeah.  And I heard the most horrendous Loverboy music blasting all through Times Square, and I look  at Kenny, who was driving me in today, and I go, that better not be, what's his name, 
[00:10:00]  Mike Love?  I have no idea.  I have no idea.  I go, that better not be the lead singer Loverboy, because he sounds horrible.  Well, he said, who the hell's covering Loverboy?  Oh, you were covering Loverboy, too.  Yeah, and I go, it's Loverboy.  It's Loverboy.  So then we're trying to figure out, was it the people behind the scenes trying to get  the sound right?  And that's what they do.  And I'm hoping that was the case, because this was the worst-sounding Loverboy ever.  No, it was really them.  This is another example of when those guys can't hit the high notes.  Anymore, yeah.  When that part, when he goes, get ready, let's go.  Yeah.  And so I was like, go, that part. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  Couldn't hit it.  He went, go, go, and it just kind of cracked off the mic.  But is it confirmed that that was Loverboy, or could it have been sound people?  I sure hope it wasn't.  I sure hope it wasn't.  It was horrendous.  And what were Opie and E-Rock doing in the car together this morning?  Hey, do tell, do tell.  Ooh, Eric.  Spill, spill.  Giving a little information there.  Actually, I think you should bring in Kenny, because when I walked out of my building.  Kenny's downstairs in my truck waiting for me.  Kenny said that E-Rock gave him a hand release this morning.  What?  Wow.  That's what he told me.  I needed a ride, so I had to do what I had to do. 
[00:11:00]  Amazing.  Kenny drove you to work?  Yeah.  Yeah, I didn't.  I didn't know E-Rock was a star.  Kenny, E-Rock has a driver now.  His car took this shit.  Well, that doesn't mean...  I walked out of my building, and the windows in Kenny's truck were very fogged up.  That's all I know.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, K-E-N.  And then E-Rock jumped out of the front seat and got in the back seat.  That's all I'm saying.  That's what I saw.  Apparently, Eric is too fancy for public transportation.  Yeah, Casey's crying.  Who's crying? 
[00:11:30]  I know.  I feel so bad.  Casey Anthony was taken ill when she was forced to look at horrible pictures of her dead daughter.  Is that what she pulled yesterday?  Yeah, so she had to leave the courtroom.  I feel so bad for her.  Dude, if we stick around two more minutes, we're going to have to talk to Loverboy.  Yeah, let's go to the...  Just stick around.  Talk to me about Casey Anthony.  No, we think she's not guilty, correct?  We have to be at the Kajagoogoo concert.  You don't want to hear the new single?  You guys can hang out here.  You don't want to hear the new single?  I wouldn't fucking listen to the new single if me life depended on... 
[00:12:00]  Let's play the new single.  I don't have headphones, so it doesn't matter.  You're not kidding me.  You guys got four minutes.  Sam's in Cahoots, imagine.  How do you figure?  You're finding ways to make us stay to Lover.  If it was you, everyone's looking at you.  You're missing the song, Opie.  You're missing the song.  Get in on the party.  Everyone's wondering, will you come out tonight?  You can sing that song to this.  Everyone's trying to get it right. 
[00:12:30]  Get it right.  Yeah.  Oh, that is in this song?  It sounds similar.  Oh, oh.  You think...  Are they listening to this...  After Opie and Anthony live, before they do our show?  No.  They're at 80s on 8 right now.  What's their other hit?  It was, uh...  Did they have another hit?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You think the 80s guys are sick of interviewing the 80s guys?  Yeah, like it's not the 80s anymore.  What do you guys...  And you know who the 80s guys are?  They're all former MTV VJs. 
[00:13:00]  No, what's great about the 80s channel?  They could never say no to an 80s band.  They're walking around like, oh, fuck, I gotta talk to...  And they're never gonna...  It's never gonna be like, if we do these guys, we can get somebody current.  Because they're never gonna get anybody current.  Do you think the booker comes in and says, like, I got Wang Chung?  And then the guy's like, I don't want to hear Wang Chung.  I don't want to interview him.  And then the booker goes like, please get Wang Chung!  Oh, Roland, I'm sorry, Roland.  Team Fez.  I didn't mean that. 
[00:13:30]  Team Fez.  Team Fez.  Anthony's Team Fez.  The 80s channel is frozen in time.  Yeah, it really is.  It just has to stop at 89.  That's it.  Yeah.  I love to...  Because I do listen every once in a while.  Oh, they're coming in right now.  I kid.  I gotcha.  I totally got us.  I was ready to run.  And you hear the old...  Observation.  You hear the MTV old jocks on the 80s channel talking about all the 80s music and blah,  blah, blah.  But they like talking about new music and thinking, you really gotta check out...  I forgot what it was. 
[00:14:00]  Like, if you like this, you'll like that?  But it's something very current, but they're not allowed to play it.  They can't even though they love it.  They can mention it, but they can't put it on.  They can mention how great it is, and it is based on something from the 80s, but they're  not allowed to play it.  It's the curse of Leech Radio.  Liam.  Oh.  Are they almost here?  I'm not.  Yeah, almost.  Mars, you setting up for the big gig?  You can't shake the speaker.  You have to play your game.  We haven't actually asked them if they want to play, but I'm assuming...  There's gonna be...  Oh, shit.  You might have Loverboy without them playing?  No. 
[00:14:30]  Holy fuck.  I have gotta get out to the truck and listen to this.  You're gonna want to see this.  You're gonna want to see it happen.  I am leaving right now.  Kenny, I'll be right down.  All right.  I am leaving.  And you can keep the Nagel sex man fucking hours.  It's not even good enough to shoot?  We're gonna put it up in the studio.  Oh, fuck that.  Oh, wow.  Liam, do you think they're gonna play?  I do.  Because when I initially booked them to do other stuff here, they were like,  do you want them to play?  And I didn't have the facilities to do it, so I said no.  Little did you know, you could just set up some amp. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, I didn't realize it.  We could just throw it together.  Who cares?  Well, Mars is here.  Mars has got it on lockdown, so it's just perfect.  Mars is working for the weekend.  He is working almost for the weekend.  Are you pissed off that you have to do work after 10?  No.  Oh, wow.  Do you have any idea what you're going to ask them?  No.  I don't even know any of their names or anything.  Mike Reno.  That's the lead singer.  They said Mike Love.  No, that's the Beach Boys, actually.  So they do Working for the Weekend?  Yeah.  You don't know anything about this band, do you?  I know nothing about this band.  What other songs do they have, Liam? 
[00:15:30]  Did they do anything else besides Working for the Weekend?  I'm the wrong person to ask.  They're from Canada.  You could talk to them about hockey.  How long do I have to talk to them for?  You should talk to them about Rush.  As long as you want.  We could do 10 minutes, whatever.  10 minutes?  It's up to you.  I'm thinking three.  Oh.  I feel like three is the most important thing.  You should do one question live.  Can you Wikipedia it real quick over there?  I don't know.  I mean, I've got to concentrate on hosting this show.  Okay.  I mean, I have the physical ability to, but...  What do you think if Sam does one question live?  One...  That'd be terrible.  Can we not do that? 
[00:16:00]  How many lover boys are there?  There's two people.  Oh, okay.  So it's not like a full awkward man.  No, it's Mike Reno and Paul Dean.  I'm going to write that down.  I'll remember it.  Mike...  Reno, like the city?  In Nevada.  Yeah.  And then Paul Dean.  See, I was going to say...  But they're from Vancouver.  I was going to say Paul Reed.  It's Paul Dean.  Paul Dean.  I had already forgotten it since you asked.  Right.  That's good.  That was you that put Bobo in the phone screening room while we were stuck in there, isn't  it?  No.  No, I swear that was not me.  Who was it?  It was someone else on the Opie and Anthony staff that... 
[00:16:30]  Oh, it was Danny.  I saw him in there.  Well, I didn't say that either.  Oh.  Well, I saw...  Hang on.  Why did Eric leave the mic on?  Well, I guess it adds to the charm.  He left the mic on while he's phone screening.  Yeah.  But I guess it adds to the charm of like, it's after Opie and Anthony.  I'm going to get a press release so you have that in front of you as well.  Let's do that.  What do I need all that for?  To do an interview?  We're just talking about Loverboy.  How'd you get the name of your band?  Well, what time...  Oh.  Marge, what do you think is going...  This is a disaster, huh? 
[00:17:00]  Why do you sound so confused?  Because I don't know what's going on.  Like, I guess Loverboy's coming in.  Yeah, but you wanted that.  Well, I just kind of jokingly said to Eric, let's get him on the after show.  And then once O&A was over, Eric goes, all right, you got Loverboy at 10.30.  Because it never happens.  Every guest that's ever walked in here, I've said, why don't we have them on after O&A live?  And they're never on the show.  Some bad news.  What's that?  Loverboy may have to cancel.  No!  No!  Because they just got booked on another show.  What show?  What show?  Um, it's Fox and Friends. 
[00:17:30]  You're lying.  They were on Fox and Friends this morning.  We know he's lying.  Look at his face.  You just keep asking questions until...  See, I'm sure that equipment works.  I'm sure that equipment works.  Okay, I got a text message.  Ask Reno where his red leather pants are.  Okay.  I don't know if it's an insulting question or not.  It is.  It is.  Do you know anything about Loverboy, Roland?  I do.  What do you know?  They're one-hit wonders.  Oh, man.  This could go, uh, question for Sam for Loverboy. 
[00:18:00]  Um...  Hey, Sam.  Just do what Fez does, Christ, or says nothing.  This is not the place to do that.  Uh, Andrew in New Jersey.  You're on...  I wrote that joke.  You're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Hey, Sam.  You can start with this question, because they might not get pissed off.  But just ask them if they can make a living off of that one song, because every zookeeper  in the world plays it every Friday.  Oh, like on the radio?  Yeah.  Yeah, working for the weekend.  They play that song.  That's a good question.  I'm going to say, morning zoo.  Great, great question.  I'm going to use that one. 
[00:18:30]  Isn't it the whole band, Loverboy, coming in?  Like, five of them?  There's only two coming in.  There's only two?  We're making the rest stand outside.  So whether you can do one thing, play guitar, the other one, clap his hand at the drum?  Look, Roland, I haven't worked out every element of how this is going to go.  Chris in Long Island, you have a question I could ask?  Uh, yeah.  Ask them.  Listen, they're not one-hit wonders.  Hot Girls in Love.  They got Get Lucky.  I've never heard of those songs.  Do you want to keep them on so you can interview them?  You guys are, what, 30 years old? 
[00:19:00]  I'm 27.  All right.  That's probably how long ago those songs came out.  Yeah, Get Lucky's not in the system.  Ask your mom about those songs, okay, Sam?  Okay.  She probably knows.  Have her interview them.  I will.  Maybe I should call my mom and say, look, Loverboy, I'm not familiar with your work, but  my mom is a big fan.  Here she is.  And also, she makes one hell of a mean carrot cake.  Thank you, Roland.  I just screened that other song the guy was talking about, Hot Girls in Love.  Don't recognize it at all.  All right.  If you don't recognize it, and you worked in radio for a while, you know. 
[00:19:30]  I got the hits of the greatest songs from Loverboy.  The hits of the greatest songs?  The greatest hits.  He just said that.  Eric, did you just hear him say, I got the hits of the greatest songs?  He's still learning English.  Hey.  Weren't you born in this country?  No.  Turn it loose?  Did you hear his mom's name is Rosetta Stone?  Oh, you got my feelings.  Oh, my goodness.  Good comeback.  Mars.  Ray in Virginia.  You're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Who loves you, baby? 
[00:20:00]  What's up, Ray?  I'm on the show, Sam.  Thanks, Ray.  Listen, one way you can piss him off is the original bassist died.  He was in his boat off San Francisco, and he drowned.  You could always call the new bassist by the old bassist's name.  Well, I don't know if I want to upset Loverboy.  The new bassist, his name is Spider.  Wow.  And actually, you can ask Mike Reno if he caught fat from Ann Wilson when they sang Almost Paradise  on the Flashdash soundtrack.  All right.  Thanks, Ray. 
[00:20:30]  Hey.  Anthony.  Hi.  I couldn't get enough of the shit hour, so I figured I'd call him because I forgot.  I believe Loverboy is the band that had the contest on MTV years ago where they needed  a girl for one of their music videos, and she turned out to be a fat slob and pretty  much wrecked the video.  But she was only in it for, I think, under a second because she was such a dog, and the 
[00:21:00]  hot 80s video girls were being all hot.  Of course.  And they tried to put this girl in, and she was a slob.  Okay, I just wrote down MTV contest music video, so I'll ask them about that.  Yeah, ask them.  It was a music video contest.  It was win a chance to be in a Loverboy video.  And I want to know what their opinion was when they saw the girl, saw she was a pig, did  they go like, oh, fuck, what are we going to do with this mess?  What have we done?  This has been a mistake. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, yeah.  See, I need to know.  And then we could maybe make...  God damn it.  I could maybe make some kind of comparison to E-Rock in the other room, something you  could laugh at.  Uh, sure.  That's just a crutch.  But I need an answer.  I've been waiting since the early 80s for an answer to this.  Well, I'll find the answer for you.  This is Lila Ritchie.  Thank you, Sam.  Thank you, Anthony.  I still don't...  Did you notice I call on the regular line because I still don't have the hotline number  to my own fucking show? 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, E-Rock was just shouting in my headphones, pick up line one, pick up line one.  I thought it was a different Anthony.  And then I was like, you just call on the regular line.  Someone email me the hotline number.  This sucks.  Somebody's calling the hotline.  It must be Kenny.  Why would he call while you're on the air?  To plug his Facebook?  I don't know.  But let me tell you something.  It's real easy to get through to your show, man.  Well, I don't usually take calls.  Oh, okay.  Even memes, I fend them.  People are not conditioned. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, it's Joe.  It's Brother Joe.  Ant, you stay on the line.  I can take you both.  Brother Joe, you're on with your brother, Ant.  I have a great question, Ant.  How about this?  We should ask Mike Reno how they got that drummer to freeze so still on the breaks, on  working for the weekend.  Can I make stupid fucking faces?  How do you do that?  Yeah, and why did the drummer allow that video to go out like that, where he's just making  retarded faces during the freeze frame? 
[00:23:00]  I was thinking more asking him, like, how they did it.  Like, how did they get him to stop so still, suddenly?  I'm going to ask him that.  Like, they didn't freeze frame it.  It actually was...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just ask him a stupid fucking question.  That's a pretty stupid fucking question.  I'm going to ask both the Kumia questions.  Yes, yes, mandatory.  All right, entertain me.  I'm driving home.  Entertain me!  Will do, boss.  All right.  I'm on my way to Chicago.  I'm going to Soldier Field to play tonight. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, Soldier Field?  What are you doing?  What position are you doing?  All right, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, boys.  Bye, bye.  Well, both on at the same time.  And I guess Brother Joe's out in Chicago if you want to see him play.  And Joe has a hotline.  Yeah.  Brother Joe called in on the hotline, and Anthony called in on the regular line.  Mars.  Sir.  Are the techs...  Tech, is it all set up to your liking?  Is this going to sound...  Because I want this to really sound great. 
[00:24:00]  Primo sound for what we've got today.  I see.  We have an amp, and we have our regular mic pointed at it.  Correct.  Is that technically...  Have I covered all the bases?  For what we've got in this room, yes.  Yeah.  We're squared away.  This wouldn't be what we call in the business a performance studio?  No.  Do you want me to test out the drums?  There you go.  Okay, good.  All right.  Mike Reno and Paul Dean.  Liam just handed me the press release for Loverboy.  Loverboy releases iTunes single.  It's an iTunes single. 
[00:24:30]  They didn't put it out on, like, a CD.  You know what that means, Mars.  No, really.  Coldplay does that.  Yeah, but people download that.  I mean, Coldplay does it as a statement.  For free, sometimes.  Not as, like, uh...  Who's on line 10, Eric?  Oh, I bet it's Kenny.  Who's on line 10?  Hi, I just had a really long day at work,  and I was wondering if you guys could play  elderly woman behind the counter in a small town.  We're not doing requests right now, Mystery Caller. 
[00:25:00]  That's my favorite Pearl Jam song,  and it would really make the ride home that much better.  By the way, Mystery Caller,  E-Rock just whispered in my...  Listen to the radio and listen to my voice now.  Okay, thank you, Mystery Caller.  Eric, you didn't have to whisper,  that was Opie.  I know who it was.  I wasn't listening to what was going on with him.  I'm aware of who it was.  He goes, I'm talking to him,  and he goes, that was Opie.  Thanks, Eric.  Thanks, Columbo. 
[00:25:30]  It's amazing, the emotions that Roland goes through.  You can hear this joyous laughter,  or earlier this week, it was tearful crying.  I see a hand shaking out there.  Uh-oh.  Is that Loverboy?  I don't know what they look like, Roland.  I don't know if it's them.  You could put two guys in here.  Google doesn't know who they are.  That monitor's not on behind you for me to see.  I turned it off for the, uh, when I was videoing.  Yeah, we don't have that much time left,  which is probably a blessing. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, they're coming.  Oh, they are.  I was hoping they'd take a couple more minutes.  Oh, did you fix it?  Yeah, it's, the, the thing's all good.  The monitor.  Roland's opening the door like this is his booking.  This is a picture.  It doesn't even count as it.  This is a picture of back in the day.  Well, that doesn't help me.  I'll check in if they're on the way for you.  Oh, I appreciate that, Roland.  And Mars is putting up pictures of them from 1987  as if that's what they, at all, what they look like. 
[00:26:30]  Another hotline call.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  Remember when we used to play O&A clips on this show?  Oh, Anthony's back on.  Anthony, you're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Oh, wait a minute.  Is Martha Quinn there?  No, this is not the 80s channel.  I wanted to talk to Martha Quinn.  This is, you got the wrong numbers, sir.  This is not the 80s channel.  This is After Opie and Anthony Live on the virus,  and we're going to talk to Loverboy.  Oh, I thought it was the 80s channel. 
[00:27:00]  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  Thank you very much.  Another mystery caller.  I guess Eric put his name up as Anthony.  I'm assuming that was supposed to be mystery caller unknown.  Yeah, but, Mars, you could put that picture up.  I don't know who's who.  Which two of those five are coming into the studio?  We got someone on the hotline.  Hello.  You're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Yeah, I want to file a complaint to the customer service.  I just try to make a Pearl Jam request on the Pearl Jam channel. 
[00:27:30]  And not only did the DJ say he wasn't going to play the song,  he says he doesn't play music at all.  What am I paying for if I'm tuning in the Pearl Jam station  and the DJ refuses, A, to play my request,  and B, refuses to play Pearl Jam at all?  Thank you.  This is not customer...  Don't get back to me.  My number is...  Don't, don't say your number.  This is not customer service.  This is the virus.  You called the same DJ and we do not play music here.  And I believe, I believe once again that that was Opie. 
[00:28:00]  I think it was Opie.  So I don't think he was taking this seriously.  Oh, okay.  So the text message I got was right because one of the guys in that picture  is indeed wearing leather pants.  Red leather pants.  Red leather pants.  Is that the guy that I'm talking to?  Mike Reno?  You don't know, do you, Mars?  No, I do not.  You know like mariachi bands and stuff like that.  Not this stuff, right?  That's right.  Salsa bands.  You like that salsa?  What were you thinking when Coco walked in today?  I wasn't thinking because I didn't see her. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, hotline.  Hello, you're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Hi, is this Sam Roberts?  Yes.  Sam, I just want to say, you have been doing a great job on the After 1A.  Thank you.  I listen every day, and I want to just please continue doing a great show.  Thank you so much.  Oh, they got me!  Where's the phone screeners?  I can't believe I got gotten like that. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, my God.  Who's this now?  No, this is that football player who was in the tuxedo.  And, yeah, no, that's not Loverboy.  That's some guy who works here who I don't know his name.  But, yeah, that's that football player.  I mentioned his name at the top of the show.  But he's wearing a tuxedo here.  I have no idea why.  You must not realize this is a casual environment.  But, Mars, you were talking about Coco's ass.  Actually, I wasn't.  You were asking me about her.  Yeah, you were going to answer it, and that would be you talking about her. 
[00:29:30]  I didn't see her, because I was busy.  Come on.  What?  What were you busy doing?  Working.  Hotline, hotline.  After Opie and Anthony live, who's this?  Hi, is this Sam Roberts?  Yes, this is Sam Roberts.  I'm calling to inform you that your Blue Boy blow-up doll is ready for pickup.  This is a prank.  With real features?  I swear this is a prank call.  I did not order any doll.  You didn't order the Blue Boy blow-up doll with real features? 
[00:30:00]  No, I didn't order the Blue Boy blow-up doll.  But these prank call voices are very similar to a certain mid-90s Boston radio show.  There they go.  That prank caller is gone.  What are you?  Wait, what's wrong?  I think they're here.  Why did you just get, who told you that?  No, everybody's taking pictures of that football player in the tuxedo.  Mars, I still haven't gotten to the bottom of Coco's ass with you.  You didn't get to see it?  No, not like I wanted to. 
[00:30:30]  I had a good trick.  I was telling Aunt.  Right.  While she was lined up, she took pictures with a bunch of people.  Right.  I just stood behind all of them, so she had her back to me the whole time.  Take a look at the ass that way.  Nice.  It looked good.  Even though it wasn't in a very revealing outfit, I was hoping for something a little  more revealing that we see Coco in.  But I guess she is living her day-to-day life.  She can't walk around in a string bikini all the time.  That's a little difficult with an ass like that.  Yeah, I mean, it's a liability. 
[00:31:00]  How come you didn't make sure you were in this studio the way you do with the UFC fighters?  Is it a gay thing?  No, not gay thing.  I'm just asking.  Because it's like, those are very muscular guys.  You always make sure you're in the studio when an MMA guy is here.  Well, she's married.  Hotline!  ONA, after Opie and Anthony live, who's this?  Yeah, Martha Quinn, could you please?  Billy Squire.  This is not 80s on 8.  Yeah, tell Martha, you're the screener?  No!  I want to hear Billy Squire stroke me, stroke me. 
[00:31:30]  I want to dedicate it to Anthony Weiner.  Yeah, it's very funny.  I'll tell Martha that.  Yeah, stroke me by Billy Squire.  Tell Martha.  Got it.  Love the 80s.  Long live the 80s.  Got it.  Thank you so much.  But this is not 80s on 8.  And as the hotline callers have gotten through with all their prank calls, the regular lines  are all completely full of people who obviously want a prank call as well.  Look at the phone, Mars. 
[00:32:00]  Every single line is full.  Oh, look at that.  Just pick up the phone lines.  Just go for it?  Yeah.  All right, we'll take a call from...  Is Loverboy going to get in here?  It's 10.45.  I mean, 45 after the hour for those listening on the replay.  Or in a different time zone.  Derek, you're on after Opie and Anthony live.  How can you rag on somebody that hasn't put out a single?  Real much!  Loverboy sucks!  They're not even...  I'm a Weiner's Weiner!  Good one, Derek. 
[00:32:30]  Thank you.  They're not even in here yet.  I got the one minute from Roland.  I hope so.  This is good, though, Mark.  How long do we have until today, Eric?  52 or 56?  He's not even in the other room.  He's probably screening calls.  Because the phones are going crazy today.  You can go as long as you want.  Oh, shit.  But what if I want to go a lot earlier?  What if they get in here at 10.48 and I want to go until 10.49?  We can just play Loverboy until 11.  Oh, good.  Good.  Okay, good.  Tom needs to talk to the host. 
[00:33:00]  That's me.  Tom, you're on after Opie and Anthony live.  Man Cow, love you, love your show.  This is...  What kind of wacky stunt you have turd doing today?  This is not the Man Cow Show, Tom.  Oh, that...  Dot, Tom.  Shane.  Yeah, uh...  You, uh...  Albino Negroids.  Nickelodeon.  Eating mac and cheese and steak fingers with the rest of the kids.  I've been on Nickelodeon when I was young.  Oh, you need to go back.  Thank you, Shane, for absolutely nothing.  My buddy, Struff. 
[00:33:30]  I know you're not going to steer me wrong.  Struff, you're on after Opie and Anthony live.  We usually don't take calls, Mars.  Struff.  Oh, wait.  This is...  Oh, I thought this was the...  Your overnight music show.  I was going to request the Lady Gaga song.  This is not Hits 1.  You knew that, Struff.  You knew that going in.  Oh, okay.  Well, how about Movie Theory?  What do you guys do?  No!  That's...  That's Saturday.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  Well, then, I'm sorry.  My mistake.  Thank you, Struff.  Sammy.  Sammy, you giving out tickets at Hit 1 for Rihanna?  We're not giving them out.  There's a contest.  Hotline!  After Opie and Anthony live. 
[00:34:00]  Who's this?  Yeah, I'm stuck in the Midtown Tunnel, and I can't get reception.  Could you just leave me on hold so I can listen to the show?  Yeah, if you really want to stay on hold, I'll leave you on hold.  Just for, like, three minutes until I get through the tunnel.  Okay.  Hold on, caller.  Oh, thank you.  I love the voices.  I love the voices.  Wow.  The phone lines are completely...  I mean, Eric, we didn't have to screen this much before. 
[00:34:30]  Roland is walking this way.  What's the update?  Three minutes or other way?  Three minutes.  Okay, this could be good, because then I'll only have to spend, like, two minutes with them,  maybe.  Oh, they're going to perform.  They are going to perform?  Yeah.  Wow, okay.  I'll do a preview.  Working for the weekend.  Yeah.  Now, is that Roland, or Roland is Fez?  Oh, that's Fez.  Working for the weekend.  Hey!  You really think that's going to, uh, you're going to have a meeting after that one?  Probably.  You think so?  I think overall meeting.  Is there a Liam pizza party today?  Um, there's a pizza gathering for Liam. 
[00:35:00]  And who's invited?  Whoever got the invites already is invited.  Did I get an invite?  I don't think I got an invite, though.  Oh, boy.  Oh, man.  I kid.  You could come.  Uh, I can't believe how many...  See, Anthony, let this be a lesson.  Try to get through on the regular lines now.  They're completely jammed up.  Cigars and Scotch.  Holy crap.  Daytime Sam Roberts.  This is an honor.  Um, I was just wondering, with the name of the band Loverboy, is there an Ambulat tie-in?  That's a great question to ask.  I'll try to get to the bottom of that. 
[00:35:30]  Uh, Mike in New Hampshire.  Yeah, uh, you need to ask, uh, Loverboy what their thoughts were on, uh, that song they used in Saturday Night Live with Chris Farley doing the striptease with, uh, Patrick Swayze.  Oh, yeah.  The Famous Dance.  What song did they use?  They said Working for the Weekend, the Famous Dance.  They did Working for the Weekend?  Yeah.  Oh, yes.  Okay, I'm gonna write that down.  That's a good question, Mike.  Let me write that down.  S-N-L...  Is there a famous clip?  Farley...  Swayze.  Okay.  It's where they were in, uh, like, uh, Chip and Dell's outfits. 
[00:36:00]  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  Yep.  Uh, Pete.  You're on After Open Anthony Live, Pete.  Oh, dude, I'm sorry.  Is this the Grateful Dead channel?  No, Pete.  You got the wrong channel.  How can people be this careless with their phones?  Trucking is a great song.  I'm like, I need that song.  Just do it.  Help me out.  There's nothing I can do for you, Pete.  Wavy Gravy?  No, I know about Wavy Gravy, but again, this is a talk channel.  We're just...  Wavy Gravy?  We're gonna talk to Loverboy in a couple minutes, Pete. 
[00:36:30]  I'm done with you.  Craig in Texas.  Hey.  How's it going, guys?  What's up, Craig?  You know how you can tell when they're coming down the hall?  I can tell you how.  How?  They'll be the guys riding the little rascals.  Because they're very old, you mean.  Yeah, they're old.  They'll have the comb over, you know, with the bald spot.  It'll be kind of cool.  Gotcha.  Thank you, Craig.  Bob, you're on After Open Anthony Live.  This is the squeakest fucking show on radio.  The door squeaks, the mic rig squeaks.  Do you need to hire an engineer?  Do you have anybody working up there? 
[00:37:00]  Well, Mars right now is working on making sure the sound equipment is good,  but we leave all the mics on to get that sort of, you know, backstage feel on the show.  And by the way, Bob, you missed a great opportunity.  If I were you, I would have said, the doors are squeaking, the mics are squeaking, and the show's host is squeaking.  Sam, come on.  You could have done it.  Thanks, Bob.  Jim.  Hey, buddy.  I'd like to call him with an Ichiban.  That's the wrong show, Jim. 
[00:37:30]  That's Ron and Fez that does Ichiban.  They're coming in now.  Jim, I don't have time for your nonsense, okay?  I'm sorry.  Okay.  They're coming in right now.  Loverboy is on their way to the After Open Anthony Live Studios.  What's up, guys?  What's up?  Mars, which...  Where do you want them?  Do I just pot up all the mics, all those couch mics?  This is six and seven.  Six and seven.  Yes, sir.  They're on.  That's not how you count.  That's how high Mars can count, Roland says.  All right.  Let's see. 
[00:38:00]  I'm really glad we don't have a lot of time left on this show.  That door's even squeakier than...  Oh, is that the mic?  The wider you open it, the squeakier it gets.  Because why would it work?  That's not a good response.  I don't know what we're going to talk to Loverboy about.  I'm really glad that there's only a couple minutes left on this show.  Because this could get weird.  I mean, this isn't even a real show.  Roland, you're just creaking the door on purpose.  You know what I could do?  What?  Is while you're talking, if you throw the board and program over there...  Yeah?  I could just end the show and go into commercials and... 
[00:38:30]  What?  And then I have to all...  And into Ron and Fez stuff and you can just be in there by yourself.  Well, no, because I don't want to sit here and have to talk to Loverboy about nothing.  I was joking when I said book this band.  I was kidding.  No, you weren't.  Did I do that?  He did it.  I know who did it.  I know Eric did it, but I was just kidding around.  Well, how come every other guest I've ever asked for,  it doesn't happen.  Come on, you're a professional.  Get in there and do your job.  You're right.  You're right, Eric.  You can do this.  You want to prove to the management that you deserve your own show?  Well, listen, I mean, the phone lines are off the chain for right now.  Yeah, I can't keep up with the calls. 
[00:39:00]  It's amazing.  Well, I'm not going to take any calls right now because we have very...  Pee-pee.  You don't have any time, right?  So we'll just talk to them for a minute, play the tune and be out.  I don't think they're going to be able to play in the five minutes that we have.  Five minutes.  We've got time.  We'll just play like a couple licks.  No, because Ron and Fez come on at 11 o'clock.  No, they come on at 11.10.  No, they don't.  Yeah, it's around 11.10.  Oh, is it?  Yeah, I mean, Ron and Fez come on whenever Ron and Fez come on.  So you can go past 11.  Yes.  Eric says yes.  Eric says...  I mean, he's my supervisor right now. 
[00:39:30]  You see that, Eric?  That's a card I like to play because technically Eric's title that the bosses gave him is above  mine.  Even though, you know, I'm a take charge type of guy, when it comes time to like figuring  out who's responsible for this, I'm going to use that.  You know what I mean?  I'm going to use the pecking order.  In common day-to-day life, it doesn't mean anything to me.  But when it comes time to, okay, who's to blame for Ron and Fez starting late, that would  be Eric Nagel.  He gets paid more than you do.  He does.  He gets paid.  And Mars, it's good you brought that up because Eric gets paid a lot more than me. 
[00:40:00]  Correct, Eric?  So you say.  Can you play the song at the end of the interview, though?  Yes, we will.  Eric, play the song at the end of the interview.  It's on the computer over there.  Mars has to play it.  Okay.  Where is it on the computer?  It was set up.  Did you close it out?  I'll be right there.  Hang on.  Okay, yeah.  Just come here and set it up so we have it.  Because we're going to play the song at the end of the big Loverboy interview.  I guess they're going to the bathroom right now.  Hey, Sam?  Yeah?  Management's on the phone in the office here, and they said absolutely they're not going 
[00:40:30]  to miss Loverboy.  Okay, so this is a priority for the channel right now.  I hope Ron and Fez people are listening.  I don't want to step on any toes.  But who for management said that?  Is he still in there or is he coming around?  Okay, I'll ask him when he gets here.  Eric, who for management said that?  One of the cute guys.  Rob Cross.  Yeah.  Okay.  Rob Cross said that, so he's even higher than Eric.  They're coming in now.  Ladies and gentlemen, here they are.  Loverboy. 
[00:41:00]  Paul.  In the building.  Paul Dean.  Make yourself comfortable.  You can just grab that seat.  Can I sit over here by the guitar?  Mike.  Yeah, sit over by the guitar.  Mike Reno.  It's a pleasure.  How you doing, man?  Loverboy is in the house.  This is after Opie and Anthony Live.  This is, just so you get a, that's my pal, E-Rock.  Let me turn on the buttons at you.  They're all on.  They're all on.  And you are with the babes.  That's Eric.  He knows Paris Hilton.  You know, they kind of have a friendship.  We're already tuning up the guitar.  This is amazing.  This is like a show where we kind of let whatever happen, happen. 
[00:41:30]  You know what I mean?  I hear you.  Like the behind the scenes stuff.  We're going to let it go on the air.  Good.  That's why it's a little, you know, off the cuff.  All the warts and farts, so to speak.  That's right.  That's exactly right.  I want to die Pepsi.  You want to die Pepsi?  Yeah, sure.  One is coming up for you, Mike Reno.  That's lunch for me.  Die Pepsi.  Now, let me ask you guys this.  You were on Fox News earlier today.  Yeah.  What was it like being in front of the crowd again?  Well, you know what?  We play a lot of concerts.  Sure.  We did, it's the TV cameras that kind of throw you off. 
[00:42:00]  But you know what?  It was fun.  Yeah.  They played a bunch of, you know, they let us play for a whole hour and it was great.  Did you see the Sirius XM signs that says, we love Loverboy?  Yes, we did.  They were throwing them up in the crowd.  I guess that's the secret.  Like, if you book interviews after your concerts, whoever you got interviews with would just come  down with some signs.  Exactly.  Because we were watching on one of the TVs up here and we didn't see, you know, the  O.B. and Anthony show has been on Fox News a lot lately.  Yeah.  Because we, you know, the Wiener scandal. 
[00:42:30]  I know.  We're the show that let the picture out.  Are you kidding?  Yeah.  The show that people have been talking about like all day yesterday.  And there it is now.  That was us.  Is it?  Yeah.  They're talking about us again.  So we know what it's like to be in the spotlight, just like Loverboy.  What are the chances of the guy with the name Wiener taking a picture of his wiener?  This is what he's doing.  You'd think he'd have more sense than that.  You know?  Now, a couple of fans actually called in.  One, Anthony is a regular caller to the show and a big fan.  He called in when he found out that you guys were coming in because he wanted to know. 
[00:43:00]  There was a Loverboy contest on MTV.  Is this correct?  There was a few.  There was many of them.  Yeah.  The music video.  Oh, yeah.  The Loverboy's music video.  That's a great story.  Now, he was saying that in this contest, a girl got to be the girl in the music video.  Right.  And what happened was a fat, slob-type girl kind of won the contest.  Right.  Did you?  I'm glad you agreed.  And?  Did you guys realize?  Well, it wasn't that she was weird-looking. 
[00:43:30]  She was plowed.  She was.  She was waiting around.  She waited around as long as we did, probably longer.  Uh-huh.  And by the time her thing came, she was plastered.  She could hardly walk.  So that's why they...  She was drunk and a little overweight.  And she didn't want to get out of the...  She didn't want to come out of the limo.  She locked herself in the limo.  Why?  She drank all the booze in the limo.  She was nervous.  So she decided...  Did you realize it was going to be a disaster when you saw her?  I kind of had a feeling.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because the deal was, there was about 15 beautiful babes running around the catacombs in the 
[00:44:00]  Mojave Desert.  The wind was blowing naturally.  The moon was coming down.  And then all of a sudden, you know, Shrek comes out of the...  Shrek.  Won't get out of the limo.  I mean, what do you do?  Yeah.  Is that why she was only in for like a second?  Yeah.  That's exactly right.  They shot her on her.  Let's put it like that.  We actually have a fan that wants to get through, if you don't mind taking a call real quick.  This is Pete in Long Island.  Pete, you're on After Opie and Anthony Live with Loverboy.  WPLJ plays all the hits.  Did I win? 
[00:44:30]  No, this is not WPLJ.  Sirius XM.  I thought I...  Oh, I thought I won.  Hey, Loverboy.  Love the hits, man.  Love those hits.  Thank you.  But over the 80s, you guys got me through plenty of times.  Lots of chicks back in the 80s.  And even though you look like a bunch of cocksuckers.  Oh, jeez.  Pete.  You look like a bunch of faggot cocksuckers.  Pete, stop.  Oh, nice.  Jesus.  Yeah, real.  Your fucking red leather.  Pete. 
[00:45:00]  Pete.  I'm going to hang up on him.  Listen to that.  I'm going to hang up on him.  Do you mind?  I think he has some anger issues.  Yes.  Did he eat the rest of the band, you fag...  Jeez.  Okay, I hung up on him.  He's gone.  Oh, man.  That's the thing about satellite radio.  It's like you go to a live caller.  They tell a call screener, you know, I want to talk to you about...  And then all of a sudden, they think it's their show.  You know what I mean?  I hear you.  But you probably had to deal with negative criticism a lot, you know, in a famous band.  You know what?  Nobody used to like us, but the people that came to see us, all the reviewers, used to 
[00:45:30]  say something negative.  Who cares?  We just have fun.  Working for the weekend has been used by so many different people.  I mean, every morning zoo uses it to start the weekend, still to this day.  It was used on SNL, right?  In the Chris Farley-Patrick Swayze sketch.  That's my favorite.  Is that your favorite moment that it was used?  Well, I didn't know they were doing it.  I just caught it by accident.  I was packing the bag, getting ready.  The next morning, I was flying somewhere else to play some more shows, and I caught it  by mistake, and I just thought it was hilarious, and I just rolled laughing. 
[00:46:00]  It was great.  What do you guys think of all the...  Did you guys realize when you put this song out that, you know, for the next 20 years,  people would be using it to kick off the weekend on their radio shows?  I don't know.  I never thought about it.  You don't write songs to think that.  I never did.  What do you think, Paul?  I don't know.  The only thing I know is that we...  The first time we played that tune, we were playing a little bar on Vancouver Island.  We played three sets, and the first two sets, there was nothing going on.  It was like a meat market.  No dancing, just drinking.  We opened the third set with Working for the Weekend, and the dance floor was packed, 
[00:46:30]  so I figured this is probably...  It's going to hit.  This is a good song.  Now, tell me this.  Today is Friday.  Yeah.  I mean, the weekend is coming.  Some people do have weekend jobs.  We got the guitar.  We got the amp.  I see what you're getting at.  What are the odds that we could get, you know, even a verse of it?  Well, you've come to the right place.  I love this.  And you've got the right people.  Yes!  Everyone's watching to see what you will do. 
[00:47:00]  Everyone's looking at you.  Everyone's wondering, will you come out tonight?  Everyone's trying to get it right.  Get it right. 
[00:47:30]  Everybody's working for the weekend.  Everybody wants a new romance.  Everybody's going off the deep end.  Everybody needs a second chance.  Oh, you want a piece of my heart. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah!  Lover boy!  That was beautiful.  After Opie and Anthony Live, that was fantastic.  After all these years, you guys still got it.  Ah, thanks, man.  You know what I mean?  You still got it.  One more question.  Uh-huh.  In the video for Working for the Weekend.  Right.  Your drummer in the freeze frames.  Oh, yeah.  Making some very strange faces.  Animated.  Why and how?  French, Canadian, very emotional.  He just plays the drums with his face, his whole body.  He's a very physical guy. 
[00:48:30]  And he hits those drums.  He's like,  You should hear when we record.  And you just solo the drums.  You can hear him going,  Did he not realize that he'd look silly?  Ah, you know what?  Silly is kind of relative, don't you think?  I think you're right.  Yeah.  I think wrestlers look silly.  You do?  You know what I mean?  They got the funny outfits and the thingies.  But they're so tough.  They're tough.  You know?  You don't want to mess with them.  Well, we appreciate you guys stopping by.  Mike Reno and Paul Dean from Loverboy. 
[00:49:00]  We're going to close the show with your new song.  Awesome.  Because it's not like, you know,  you guys just made one song back then.  Or a bunch of songs back then.  Yeah.  You're still making music.  We are trying.  Trying our very best.  Tell us a little bit about the new song.  Paul, you want to talk about it?  Bob Rock, one of the biggest producers in the world.  Probably the biggest thing he's done is Metallica.  He did a few albums with them and he's done it.  I saw him on the documentary, I think.  That's right.  That's right.  And Brian Adams and Bon Jovi.  Well, he was our original engineer back in 1980. 
[00:49:30]  And he called us up about six months ago.  He said,  I got this tune.  I think you'll like it.  It sounds like Mike could sing the hell out of this tune.  And he sent it to us and I said,  this is perfect.  This is exactly for Mike.  So we recorded it.  That's great.  Demoed it to death.  And we got together.  We cut it in two days.  Rehearsed it and recorded it and mixed it in two days.  Unbelievable.  Two songs.  Absolutely.  And here it is.  Heartbreaker by Loverboy.  Thank you guys so much for stopping by after Opie and Anthony Lawson.  Awesome, man.  Sex Bagel.  Hit it.  Yeah. 
[00:50:00]  Come on, baby.  Come on, baby.  Well, she's crazy like a fox.  She's smoky like a wolf.  Her daddy didn't need her, so she reads a good book.  She's like a tangerine you pick from a tree.  In the Garden of Eden, you can look but don't eat. 
[00:50:30]  But she's ready and willing and it's killing me.  Ready and willing and it's killing me.  Ready and willing and it's killing me.  Yeah.  Oh, I should have known, I should have known a little bit better.  Sometimes the heart, sometimes the heart needs a heartbreaker.  Oh, if I die tonight, it'll be alright.  Cause I'm with her. 
[00:51:00]  Sometimes the heart needs a heartbreaker.  Push.  Push.  Push.  Push.  Push.  Push.  Push.  Yeah.  She talks like a man.  She walks even faster.  A devilish grin.  A beautiful disaster.  Definitely something worth getting lost in. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  She may be from heaven.  She may be from hell.  She may be from Jersey.  Yeah, I can't tell, but she's causing my whole world to sting  Cause she's ready and willing and it's killing me  Ready and willing and it's killing me  Ready and willing and it's killing me, yeah  Oh, I should've known, I should've known a little bit 
[00:52:00]  Sometimes a heart, sometimes a heart needs a heartbreaker  Oh, if I die tonight, it'll be alright  Cause I'm with her  Sometimes a heart, needs a heartbreaker  I should've known a little bit 
[00:52:30]  Cause she's ready and willing and it's killing me  Ready and willing and it's killing me  Ready and willing and it's killing me, yeah  Yeah, yeah  I should've known, I should've known a little bit  Better  Sometimes a heart, needs a heartbreaker  Oh, if I die tonight, it'll be alright 
[00:53:00]  Cause I'm with her  Sometimes a heart, needs a heartbreaker  I should've known, I should've known  I should've known a little bit  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Oh, if I die tonight, it'll be alright  Cause I'm with her
