<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts boasting about their shock jock status and disdain for politeness, immediately launching into absurd banter about a machine accelerating to 180 mph and a fleeting mention of Chris Benoit.  Technical difficulties, attributed to interference from the nearby CBSFF station whose employees were derisively described as "creepy, needy, and kiss-ass-y," were acknowledged.  A lengthy discussion ensued about Hillary Clinton's comments perceived as racist toward white voters, debating whether it was genuine racism or political maneuvering. This transitioned into a conversation on workplace humor and its boundaries.

The conversation then shifted to LeBron James and Papa John's "crybaby" t-shirts, followed by the ensuing 23-cent pizza promotion and the resulting long lines.  A substantial segment was devoted to a discussion of a cult and its sexually abusive leader, featuring audio clips from Larry King's interview with the cult leader's son.  The hosts analyzed the son's denial of his father's relationship with his wife and the leader's justifications for the girls' nudity.

The show veered into tangents about the hosts' appearances (Anthony's new tactical gear), speculation on Ryan Seacrest replacing Larry King, and a harrowing story about an Austrian man who imprisoned and repeatedly raped his daughter for 24 years, fathering six children.  Audio from an interview with the man, detailing his perverse version of "idyllic family life" in the bunker, was played.  The hosts interjected personal anecdotes, including one host's struggles with body odor and another's mother's sayings.  A caller shared a story about a cult documentary depicting murder and suicide.  The broadcast briefly touched upon negative reviews of *Speed Racer* and *88 Minutes*, with Jimmy Norton recounting his experience watching the latter.

A separate segment focused heavily on Al Pacino's acting style, particularly his tendency towards yelling, analyzing his vocal evolution across films like *Dog Day Afternoon*, *Injustice for All*, and *Scent of a Woman*.  *Godfather III* received a brief mention, with a caller incorrectly claiming it won an Academy Award.  The discussion then moved to gas prices, humorous solutions, and a satirical take on the movie *What Happens in Vegas*, its tagline, and predictable plot.

Several listener calls, including those from the "FU Line," were featured.  "Club Soda Kenny," known for dark humor, provided morbid traffic and weather reports, including a fabricated story about a garbage truck crashing into a nursing home.  A news story about teenagers using a skull to smoke marijuana prompted a humorous, morbid brainstorming session.  The segment concluded with an interview with Jamie Kennedy, promoting his documentary *The Heckler*, where he shared anecdotes from his acting career, including roles in *Boogie Nights* and *As Good As It Gets*, and experiences with hecklers and online criticism.  The interview also touched upon a chance encounter with George Lucas.  The conversation then delved into body odor, foot fetishes, a news story about torturing drug traffickers (leading to a "blank game" segment), and a video of a girl with Tourette's syndrome using racial slurs.  A brief simulcast with Don Imus promoting his radiothon concluded this section.

Another segment focused on Borat, its controversial content, and the explicit interactions with real people.  The discussion became sexually explicit, using vulgar language and graphic descriptions.  Sandy Kane, a self-identified "naked cowgirl," was a studio guest, leading to a series of increasingly outrageous and sexually explicit interactions with the hosts and a male audience member, involving offers of money for nudity and suggestive acts.  The discussion included the video of the girl with Tourette's, a soccer star's transvestite scandal, and a producer's frustration.  A band with a mentally disabled frontman and Don Imus' apparent lack of acknowledgment of the show were also discussed. Sandy Kane performed a song, further fueling the explicit conversation.  Pat Duffy, a regular contributor, received ribbing, and Kenny and "Mikey B from Survivor" were mentioned.

A later segment featured Sandy Kane's performance, interrupted by Opie cutting her guitar strings, leading to a chaotic scene.  Further sexually explicit propositions and interactions followed, including a request for someone to slap their penis against her cheek.  Mikey B and Pat Duffy volunteered (though Mikey B. later declined).  Johnny Fairplay and his girlfriend (who recently had a baby), along with other guests, were present. Crude comments about Tyra Banks were made. Pat Duffy’s attempt to fulfill Sandy's request resulted in yogurt splattering, further escalating the vulgar banter.  Johnny Fairplay defecated in Sandy Kane's hat, which she then wore for money.  A burlesque dancer then performed in the studio.


A final segment featured Patty's racially charged coffee shop story, leading to more off-color jokes and banter from the hosts and guests, including Jimmy and Flea.  Jimmy promoted his appearance on an MTV2 show, struggling to remember the host's name.  Sandy Kane shared highly inappropriate and rambling stories about her sexual encounters, dominating a significant portion. Flea discussed his unsuccessful modeling attempts and questionable pick-up lines. He performed a rendition of "Never Gonna Give You Up," prompting a caller's disgust.  References to FTD.com and AshleyMadison.com were made.  The show concluded with closing remarks.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  In the world of radio shock jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good. 
[00:00:30]  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio host, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Do you play a prostitute with bipolar?  I do.  Fantastic.  Jimmy's in love.  Wonderful.  Both qualities I look for when I meet someone. 
[00:01:00]  We are sick freaks.  All right, Chris Benoit.  Oh boy.  All right.  Anthony.  I leaned on the machine by accident and it hit a button.  This is where entertainment is going.  How fast did you get it up to?  180 miles an hour.  What's the matter with you, you idiot?  Cut this .  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, it's Friday in the big city.  Yes.  Yes.  Is that an echo?  Is it?  I hear an echo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are they putting an echo on us now?  Is that because CBSFF is in the same building as us?  How do I turn up the echo?  You got the big echo.  How do I turn on? 
[00:02:00]  There we go.  I want more echo.  Echo.  More echo.  Hello, hello, hello.  Oh.  Tim, give me some echo.  Oh, no.  He wants echo.  Does he want echo?  I don't think he knows what he's doing.  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  Thank you.  That's a good one.  Is that just in the headphones, though, or is that going out?  Your oldie station. 
[00:02:30]  CBSFF is back.  They're down the hall.  I know.  We met those creeps the other day walking back from the corporate gathering.  Like I said, they're down the hall.  They were a little creepy.  Refrain from the creep thing.  They were a little creepy, a little needy, a little too much kiss-ass-y.  There was a lot of love there, I was feeling.  And we also met Mr. G, a legend in the news business.  Indeed. 
[00:03:00]  And man, I learned more about him in five minutes.  Yeah.  Well, he certainly did.  Maybe we'll get into that another day.  See if Mr. G wants to share some of the fine stories he was telling me.  Probably not.  I don't think so.  No.  All right.  We're just babbling.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  That's what the show is all about.  As I sit here and wait for this dumb claritin to kick in.  Oh, yeah?  And Kenny goes, I wouldn't take the claritin on an empty stomach, GH. 
[00:03:30]  No.  I'm like, Kenny, I can't see out of my eyes.  They're itchy.  They're red.  I'm full of snot.  I need my claritin.  He's like, that wouldn't be a good idea.  You need to eat some food first, GH.  No, you don't.  I wouldn't do that if I were you.  And who wants to eat when you first get here?  You need some coffee.  You need some water.  And then you seg into some food finally.  Slowly get into the food thing.  Yep.  So I finally ate 15 minutes ago.  So now I got to wait, what, an hour for the claritin to kick in?  Yeah. 
[00:04:00]  When I should have taken the claritin as soon as I got here and I would have been cleared up  and cleared up and ready to go.  I'm right at six o'clock.  I take a leg rid of the every day.  You're fine.  You don't need to be a full stomach for claritin.  For a stupid little claritin.  I don't know.  It's over the counter, isn't it?  Or under the counter?  What is what?  Where is it?  Over the counter?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't.  Oh, what are you doing?  That's a dangerous narcotic.  I have a tool. 
[00:04:30]  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  So we're waking up to the news that Hillary Clinton is, what, a racist?  Is that what they're saying?  Well, yeah.  Look, this show is very, very hard on Hillary Clinton.  Yeah.  I think most people know that.  But this is complete BS that's going on in the paper this morning.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  What's the deal?  What's the big headline here?  Well, apparently Hillary was commenting on the fact that more white people would vote  for her than would vote for Obama and have, you know, in the past. 
[00:05:00]  And now she's being called out on that comment as being racist.  How is that racist?  Meanwhile, 98% of black people are voting for Obama.  Is that really a real stat?  A real stat.  Yeah.  So just along, completely along racial lines, the whole Obama and black people thing.  Sure, there's white people voting for Obama.  A lot of white people are digging them, you know?  But the fact of the matter is, black people are voting for a black guy. 
[00:05:30]  That's all it is.  It's not that these are such revolutionary ideas that they're going, wow, this is, you  know, the candidate that I think is good for me based on his policy, voting on a skin  color and a heritage and background.  And Hillary just brought up the fact that more white people are going to vote for me.  And then people freak out.  Well, you can't say that.  Well, this is all just marketing.  You don't think they sit there and go, well, what percentage of the black vote do we have? 
[00:06:00]  What percentage of the Hispanic vote do we have?  What percentage of the white vote do we have?  Yeah.  What percentage of males 18 or 34?  You know, that's all it is.  Yeah.  That's how we do it in radio.  They sit there in the back office and go, wow, you guys do very well with white males.  Is that racist?  Should we drag them into the court of law?  Yes.  It's just we've gotten so stupid with this racism thing because it's not even. 
[00:06:30]  This is what advertisers do on TV and everywhere.  It's you look at your demographics.  Demographics.  That's all she's saying with that comment.  Everything gets called racism now.  That really doesn't fit the category.  I want to see some racism.  There's plenty to plenty to go around.  There was some real racism.  Oh, I thought not the old crap like this.  I thought what you were going to say there is you want to see some real racism.  Let's start broadcasting at five in the morning.  What?  What?  No. 
[00:07:00]  The drive in or office.  Let's get some mics in the office.  There is some off color jokes that happen in the office.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  Fire us?  I guess they could.  What are you going to do?  Not broadcast it.  I don't know why.  I don't know why you're saying.  What did you just say?  You made it sound like there's a lot of people involved in this whole off color thing.  I said in the office there are a few off color jokes that go around and make the rounds.  Make the rounds? 
[00:07:30]  Or are they pinpointed?  What?  Is it just coming from my desk?  To a certain individual.  And are they really jokes more?  Or are they just more so comments that are thrown out?  It's not a joke if you don't even look up from the paper.  It's not a joke.  It's not a joke if you're not looking around the room for approval.  Seeing who's reacting and laughing and chuckling.  You know what though?  What goes on in our office before 6 o'clock, it's going on in every office in America. 
[00:08:00]  Of course it is.  Well, behind closed doors, of course.  It's got to be.  Or in that special cubicle where the cool guy hangs out.  Or you get in trouble so you don't say it.  And when you say that, a lot of people think it's just Whitey doing it.  Please.  Yeah.  The other, quote, groups are having their fun with other groups as well.  At work?  Oh my God, yeah.  At work?  It's everywhere.  Really?  At work? 
[00:08:30]  Well, when you're waiting in line for a pizza for 23 cents.  Dopes in Cleveland.  God, I love Cleveland.  But then again, it wasn't our demographic waiting in line for pizza.  No.  Yesterday.  What's that story about?  What is the pizza story?  Because LeBron James choked?  Yeah.  And they cooked.  Oh my God, is he actually going to talk on mic?  Yes.  Ladies and gentlemen, Stunt Brain has decided to take a microphone and talk on the Opie and Anthony show.  Slid over to E-Rock's...  You might as well just...  You know what? 
[00:09:00]  You might as well just make that your home.  E-Rock, get lost.  Get lost.  Stunt Brain.  Wow.  Just...  I'm freaking out now.  It was apparently a reaction to the Cry Baby t-shirts that Papa John's Pizzeria handed  out mocking LeBron James and now they're apologizing because they were called to the carpet.  So they're mocking LeBron James for being a cry baby.  Why was he being a cry baby again?  I'm a little lost here.  They call him a cry baby on the court because he tends to whine when things don't go his  way.  Right.  So they accurately called him a cry baby.  And Papa John had shirts made up and what, were handing it out at the game? 
[00:09:30]  People were wearing them and saying, hey, cry baby, cry baby.  All right.  And he cried about it.  Part of the game.  Oh, then LeBron James cried about the cry baby t-shirts.  Oh, God.  So Papa John said, okay, we're sorry.  Here's some 23-cent pizza.  See, then Papa John bailed and said, oh, now we're in a little trouble.  So now it's 23-cent pizzas.  Large pizzas.  And they showed the line on TV this morning.  Yeah.  And Mike was telling me these people were waiting hours to save $4.77 is about what 
[00:10:00]  we figured.  Because I think the pizza normally goes for about $5.  Isn't your time worth something?  Yes.  Isn't everyone's time worth something?  So if you figure your time is worth a couple of bucks an hour, so you could stand there  for two hours for pizza.  Papa John's.  I wonder if anyone likes Papa John's.  Hey, do you like the garlic butter sauce?  What do you like there, E-Rock?  I know you like something about Papa John's, but I can't quite remember what it is. 
[00:10:30]  Hmm.  Well.  You better just say it.  Yeah, you better just say it.  It's amazing.  It was like watching an elephant try to push a button.  I love the garlic butter sauce.  Yeah, of course.  The garlic butter sauce.  By the way, the Celtics beat the Cavs last night, so they're leading two games to zip.  So what were you saying?  So office, racism, Hillary with this dumb little thing that shouldn't be getting a lot of attention.  Fake racism and fake outrage for the fake racism. 
[00:11:00]  Nah, that's nothing.  She's just probably telling the truth for once.  Yeah.  Here's the audio.  How does Hillary Clinton win the nomination?  She called herself Hillary, by the way.  Well, Kathy, you know, there was just an AP article posted that found how Senator Obama's  support among working, hardworking Americans, white Americans.  Look, I can't even concentrate on what Hillary's saying because that dopey reporter, is she just 
[00:11:30]  making sound effects?  No one can type that fast.  I don't care who you are.  She's typing more letters than what Hillary's saying.  Typing messages in pal talk.  Listen to that.  Yeah.  Listen to that again.  Listen to how many keystrokes.  It doesn't add up to what Hillary's saying.  How does Hillary Clinton win the nomination?  Well, Kathy, you know, there was just an AP article posted that found how Senator Obama's support 
[00:12:00]  among working, hardworking Americans, white Americans, is weakening again.  And how the, you know, whites in both states who had not completed college were supporting  me.  And in independence, I was running even with him and doing even better with Democratic leaning  independent.  She's just going over Democrat. 
[00:12:30]  Well, where is that a problem?  Even though I don't like her, that's not a problem.  What, Jimmy?  Are you talking?  Yeah, that's not a problem, I don't think.  Like, she was basically just saying that white people who haven't graduated college  will vote for her because they all share the mullet.  Uh-huh.  And I don't think that's racist at all.  What, Jimmy?  She's basically saying that white people value their daughters not laying down with Negroes.  They vote for her.  Yeah, she was saying, but the way she put it was kind of odd. 
[00:13:00]  He goes, you know, hardworking Americans, white Americans.  White.  She didn't want to just say white people.  That's too revealing.  Yeah.  She was trying to throw it out there, but she didn't want to say white people.  Yeah, she sees her campaign going down the toilet.  Uh-huh.  And now it's time to just play the race card.  It's time.  If she had it her way, she would stand up and just say, look, white people, do you really  want this as president?  She'd show a picture of him. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Look, do you notice anything?  Obama's starting to hint that he wouldn't mind having her as the vice.  Really?  So she ain't going to say anything stupid now.  Because I think she would take that at this point.  I don't know.  A lot of people are saying that's a doomed ticket.  Yes, it is.  She spent her whole life trying to become the president of the United States, and she  would accept that in a second.  In a second.  You think?  Yes!  Yeah, he's a target.  Oh, you're thinking, maybe she's thinking because of the controversy of having the first 
[00:14:00]  black president that something might happen?  Yeah, she'd probably say, look, you ought to take a ride through Dealey Plaza.  She'd be trying to send them dead, dead, dangerous places.  A top on the car?  What are you, pussy?  Come on.  Come on.  Just kidding.  Kennedy didn't have a top on his car.  Or his head.  Or his head.  Ouch.  Yeah, it's a new day.  It's a new day in America.  You don't need that crap.  Who are you kidding?  Obama's calling up the Vatican. 
[00:14:30]  He's looking into how you get a Popomobile.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's going to be a black one, though.  Pimp it out.  Pimp it out, yeah.  Pimp it out a little bit.  So, Hillary Clinton.  One, two, three, four, five, six, two, three.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Johnson, Ohio, Texas, then on to Penn State.  Then on to Penn State.  Ugh.  Give her just a chance, she'll make it.  Nobody likes a title.  Any glass ceiling, she'll break it.  We're Kate's connection!  We're gonna be our president.  Is she? 
[00:15:00]  Hey, where are the white women at?  Nothing's gonna turn her back now.  I like turtles.  I'm gonna hand it on the track now.  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes...  With she's to make our dreams of true.  Hello, Clinton.  There is nothing she can do.  I'm the worldさん.  I love the world.  What offered you the vice presidential spot?  I got it from a negro.  Oh.  If I know, it's unfortunate.  She's gonna do it in world world movies. 
[00:15:30]  I love the garlic butter sun.  You use your tongue prettier than a $20 hole.  And punt.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Is she working for us all day?  For the past two years, she's done nothing.  Ah, I didn't think I...  No.  Not at all.  That answer is... 
[00:16:00]  Huh? Huh?  False.  Oh, no.  I'm going to miss that song.  That song's going away soon, huh?  Yeah, just like Hillary.  One flag!  Oh, no.  One flag.  What is that about?  Damn.  Bless you.  Thank you, sir.  So I was watching Larry King last night.  We haven't talked about... 
[00:16:30]  We haven't talked about you in a while, Anthony.  Frankenstein.  I got it.  What?  You got to start a cult.  You could get away with pretty much anything for a really, really long time.  Hmm.  I'm kind of trying to cultivate that whole cult thing.  What do you mean?  I don't know.  I think I got a new look going here.  It's very paramilitary.  Paramilitary.  Jimmy, what do you think of his new look?  Today, he's all black.  It's 5'11 gear.  Now, it's tactical pants.  You like this? 
[00:17:00]  You could hold different magazines in here.  What kind?  Like People magazine?  No, no.  A magazine.  A layman might call them a clip.  Oh.  You know, yeah.  See?  You can hold a couple of clips in here.  Yeah.  Here's for tactical pockets for more clips.  Good.  Car keys could be in there.  You can hold a DVD in the other one.  What's the matter with you?  Of course.  Yeah, see?  Got a big, deep wallet pocket.  How many hidden pockets does your new outfit have?  Oh, there's a lot.  There's a lot of hidden pockets. 
[00:17:30]  Look at this one.  Very hidden.  A lot of Velcro.  Yeah.  That's good.  Yeah.  That's good.  That's good.  Yeah.  That's for hiding, you know.  Can you do the sound of a lunatic again, please, for everybody?  Oh, is that the sound of a lunatic?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So we can hide one of his many magazines.  And you pull out.  Yeah, I see.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you're not lefty.  So why do you need one on that side?  Yeah, exactly.  That's pretty much just to hold other stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This isn't really set up for firearms. 
[00:18:00]  I'm not set up for firearms.  I hope you get caught up in a situation in New York City where all of a sudden the  real guys, like the real G.I.  Joes, see you on the street like, oh, thank God you're here.  Come on.  Come with us.  Oh, no.  We're detonating a bomb on the 80th floor.  All right.  I'm with you.  And you're just swept along.  I got to run up there with him and I have no clue what to do.  Yeah, that would be embarrassing.  I'm thinking, though, you should start a cult out here on Long Island. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  I don't think there's ever been a cult on Long Island, right?  Let me think.  On Long Island, probably not.  You got that big.  We've had some kooks.  Dude, you got that big empty house and, you know, you can fill it up with some very, very  young girls and you can get away with pretty much anything.  Like sex with them and having babies with them.  Yeah.  Things like that.  Eventually, the authorities will catch you.  Yeah.  So you got to understand that.  But I think you got to, I think you can do 10 or 12 years without.  A few years of being a cult leader. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, without anyone really noticing that all hell's breaking loose at your finest state.  Right.  No taxes either because it's under the religious.  Oh, yeah.  Guys.  Yeah, that's that's I like it.  They had they had.  What's the cult in New Mexico that was busted with the latest one?  Yeah.  Is there a couple of different ones?  This guy was having like sex with everybody.  Yeah.  And Larry King had only underage girls.  Larry King had the the cult's son on last night. 
[00:19:30]  Really?  And Larry goes, isn't it true that your father had sex with your wife?  And the son got all bent out of shape.  Did he?  That's not true.  We were officially separated when my father had sex with my wife.  But he did.  Yeah.  And then I guess there was a documentary and they actually had audio from the documentary  where the cult leader talks about banging his own son's wife.  So was it just a single occasion?  This literal physical consummation? 
[00:20:00]  No, it wasn't.  You consummated more than once?  Yes.  Yes.  Why is it necessary to consummate more than once?  Could you not answer that question yourself?  When you marry your wife, do you consummate only once?  Oh, boy.  There's the cult leader.  Oh, that's not good.  That's wonderful.  You have to worry about your own dad banging your wife. 
[00:20:30]  This guy was horny.  Oh, my God.  Cult leaders are horny.  Yeah.  They're just like having sex with apparently everybody in the cult.  Everybody.  Other age girls, the other people's wives, probably guys.  You think guys?  Just a little bit.  That won't be my cult.  No.  Just girls.  Just girls.  Mm-hmm.  And then...  You've got to get them to look at you in a godlike way, though.  That's...  How do you do that?  How do you pull that off?  You've got to grow a beard. 
[00:21:00]  Mm-hmm.  And you've got to grow your hair a little longer.  Yeah.  You've got to kind of look sort of like a rock star slash Jesus.  The Jesus look?  Not...  Did this guy look like Jesus a little?  Not completely Jesus, though.  Like David Koresh?  You need a little rock star in you, too.  A little bit.  A little bit.  You need charisma.  Yes.  Exactly.  How much do you love that footage of Squeaky Fromm and the other girls crawling bald to  the Manson trial?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, he really had a...  That guy had him knocked.  He had him in line.  The next clip, really fast.  Teenage girls explain what happened when they got naked. 
[00:21:30]  What happened?  In front of the cult leader.  Wow.  He needed to be literally physically naked.  Mm-hmm.  And so...  So he took me to the bedroom and laid down, and he held me, and somehow it was like all  of heaven was open to me.  Somehow I started to see God.  Well, somehow.  God had a little helmet on.  Did you know God spits in your face? 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  That's something that that guy could have that kind of power.  I want to call her a dummy, but she's too young to know.  How old is she?  She's a little...  Look.  She's a little thing.  Underage girls.  Is that the guy?  That's the guy.  See?  He doesn't have a Jesus look.  He looks like Grizzly Adams.  He's got...  Yeah, he's...  There's that whole thing where you got to kind of separate yourself from society, and 
[00:22:30]  then just get really grubby, and somehow you get these young girls coming toward you,  and they think you're like godlike.  She's not a little girl.  She's an adult.  You just described yourself.  What's wrong with you?  Oh, damn.  What?  Holy Jesus.  You just described yourself.  I think I'm a cult leader.  I think I'm a cult leader.  You've been coming in a little grubbier lately.  Really?  Yeah.  Hmm.  Well, somehow.  There's the son of God holding me.  Yeah. 
[00:23:00]  And, uh...  Giddy.  A lot of women have claimed to see God at that moment.  Ah.  Hmm.  Young ladies.  I'm glad I'm not a cult leader.  Do you know how fast God would show up and then leave?  I saw God for about three seconds.  What happened?  Where did God go?  God's sleeping.  Get out.  Get the holy towel and beat it.  Nice.  Uh...  Well, somehow.  There's the son of God holding me.  Yeah.  And, uh... 
[00:23:30]  So I'm laying there and I was like...  For the first time, I was like,  God loves me.  Mm-hmm.  He loves me.  And Michael was saying things to me like,  You're accepted.  You know, you're healed.  Mm-hmm.  And I felt so secure.  It was like,  I don't ever want to leave this place.  It was like,  This was God holding me.  Mm-hmm.  So, and then, you know,  The next day,  Father sent you.  Father sent you?  Father sent you. 
[00:24:00]  What a creep.  Wow.  You gotta be pretty creepy, too.  Wow.  Do I fit that, Bill?  Am I creepy enough?  No comment.  Uh, cult leader justifies naked girls.  Oh, am I creepy enough?  You have on tactical gear for a radio show.  Yes.  You are.  Yeah.  The last clip for now,  We gotta get more clips of this cult,  But, uh,  The cult leader justifies naked girls.  Cause he gotta justify it.  You gotta justify it?  A lot of people are gonna be like,  Hey, dude, what's up?  You know,  Why the naked girls  If we're just, uh,  Praying to the, 
[00:24:30]  The,  The,  The Holy Father there.  The Holy Father.  Well, it was God.  God came down on them  And told them to do it.  Really?  Nakedness  Is another symbol  Of our relationship with God.  We are naked  And unashamed.  I treated them  With the same respect  And deference  As if I'd been  A physician  An MD 
[00:25:00]  Who was doing surgery  Uh-huh.  Uh,  You know,  MDs  Are with naked people.  Yeah.  They're MDs.  So are rapists.  They're with naked people, too.  You can't really  Uh,  Make the comparison.  Wow.  This guy's  Got it, though.  It was,  It was an amazing hour  On Larry King last night.  I'm like, wow.  And this guy got away  With it for a long time.  How long was he  With that group? 
[00:25:30]  I don't know.  How important is the KY?  I think he made it,  Uh,  I think he was  Started in the 90s,  Uh, Jimmy.  Somewhere in the 90s there.  Oh, no.  Uh,  Yeah, okay.  Late, uh,  Wow, like 87.  He did this for more or less  20 years.  He was developing  This whole thing.  Where's Larry King?  That's not got a question.  Do we have that clip?  Yeah, where's Larry?  Larry wasn't that bad,  You know?  Really?  No, but I mean  With the kid getting mad  And getting mad  At the fucking question.  Uh, yeah,  We can find that.  I mean,  Maybe I over, 
[00:26:00]  Over described it  Or over sold it,  But  Because sheets must look  Like a Japanese flag.  Ow.  Steven S.  Is still obsessed  With Tom Chiasano  Who's been gone  A few months now.  Years, it seems.  Steven S.  Writes,  Uh,  Tom Chiasano  Left to start  His own cult  Of dullards.  Why, Steven?  Why?  Just because he didn't  Pay you?  Yeah,  It's exactly why.  Phone number  877-212-0&A  Just getting started. 
[00:26:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony  Show in progress.  Starring little  Jimmy Norton.  Gene.  Starring Opie and Anthony  Features, Jimmy Norton.  Features.  Features.  Ooh.  Jimmy Norton.  And as.  You get the and as.  And as?  And Jimmy Norton as  Norton.  Or as himself.  Yeah.  And as.  That was a big thing  being the last  in the credits 
[00:27:00]  of a sitcom  when you were  the and as.  And Tom Bosley  as Mr. Cunningham.  What about  Jim Norton  playing himself?  That would be  and Jim Norton  as himself.  As himself.  I like that.  And as.  You're a as himself.  I think Norton and Friends  sums it up nicely too.  Norton and Friends.  Now you've gone too far, Jimmy.  You've gone too far.  I'm Norton.  You're all my friends.  No, no, no.  It's honest.  I got the question 
[00:27:30]  that Larry asked  the son of the cult leader  about the father  sleeping with his son's wife.  Did you goof on your dad  and say,  how do I taste?  I'm fascinated by cults,  by the way.  I always have been.  People love cults.  It just shows you  how many kooks  are in this world.  Because you got like  moms and dads.  They join the cult  and then they bring  their own kids in  and then the kids  are having sex  with the cult leader  and the kids are underage.  It's like, 
[00:28:00]  as a parent,  as a parent,  you're fine with all that.  They don't seem to mind.  Like, how do you get like,  how do you get that voodoo?  That guy's got all the cult leaders.  That's why there's not like  cults all the time.  They just occasionally pop up.  You got to be a special  kind of fella  to get people to  just blindly follow you like that.  David Koresh,  he was one.  Jim Jones.  Jim Jones was a classic.  And then that wacky  cut off your mail parts  and lay in the bed  with your Nikes.  Marshall White Apple? 
[00:28:30]  Ah, yes.  Yeah, the Nike guy.  White Apple.  I like to call him  the Nike guy.  Because they were going to go  to the spaceship  behind the comet.  Yeah.  Which is,  if you could talk  someone into that.  I wonder who's wearing  all those Nike shoes nowadays.  You know somebody is.  They came away.  Well, somebody.  The goodwill.  There are people out there.  We knew one of these guys,  Chuck Farnham,  back in the day.  Yeah.  There are people out there  that collect all this.  Andy Gore down there  in Washington, Jimmy.  Another one.  Same type of guy.  They collect this  really weird stuff.  So, if the Nike shoes 
[00:29:00]  ended up somewhere,  these guys would hunt it down  and make sure they get  the Nike shoes.  Would you wear them though?  From the cult leader.  Or just kind of collect them.  No, you put them on display.  On display in your house?  Yeah, yeah.  You know what these are right here?  See this under this glass?  Yeah.  These Nikes.  Were on a dead body.  Were on a dead guy.  Who had no junk.  From the White Apple, yeah.  Because he cut his own junk off  to get ready for the spaceship.  Which brings me  to the next glass case.  Yeah.  You might think  those are prunes.  So, here's Larry King.  Do you know how, by the way, 
[00:29:30]  shriveled it would be  in a case if it was cut off?  Wow.  It would be horrendous.  Look awful.  Where'd you get the pig knuckle?  No, you don't understand.  Larry King asked the guy's father,  asked about guy's father  having sex with his wife.  How did you react  to that circumstance?  That circumstance?  That's putting it lightly.  Way to put it.  I'm going to miss Larry  when they boot him out the door.  I just re-signed.  Come on, now they're saying  that Ryan Seacrest 
[00:30:00]  has taken over in 2009.  Really?  There was some chatter, right?  Hollywood chatter?  No.  Is he just the go-to guy  for everything?  I guess so.  No one likes him.  Yeah, there's not one person  I know that actually  enjoys what he does.  I don't...  No one in our world  likes him,  but he's in that other world.  He's in that hater.  He's in that safe world  where they don't have couples  having sex at churches  and, you know,  he's in that very safe world  that we don't know much about.  What about Anderson Cooper?  Does he not want to do 
[00:30:30]  Larry King's job?  No one likes Ryan Seacrest.  He's not likable.  I mean, I know the American public  probably likes him,  but no one I know.  There isn't even like...  It's not even where,  oh, I can't stand this guy.  I just...  I have no feeling  about him whatsoever.  He's not...  There's no excitement factor  like, oh, cool,  he's taking over  for Larry King.  I mean,  who cares?  Yeah.  He'll stink.  His dumb smile.  He'll smile at everything.  Charming.  Yeah, a bunch of like  softball questions.  Yeah.  At least he'll be better 
[00:31:00]  than Larry's these days,  though,  because Larry's  completely lost his mind,  which makes it more entertaining.  Well, here's Larry  talking about this fine cult.  How did you react  to that circumstance?  Well,  I would like to correct  something, Larry,  for the record,  and that is that  my dad did not have sex  with my wife.  My wife...  You said he did,  that, didn't he?  Sir,  we were divorced,  separated...  We were separated  permanently  in August of 2006, 
[00:31:30]  and we had terminated  our marriage relationship  at that time,  and by the time  my former wife  was spiritually married  to Michael  and went through  the consummation  with him,  our relationship  was over.  It was terminated.  so he did not  have sex  with my wife.  Oh, okay.  That clears it up.  After she dumped you  for dad,  who's apparently  a bigger boy.  He calls Mike.  There's a lot of people 
[00:32:00]  out there  that are divorced.  So just follow this through.  So you're divorced  from your wife.  You don't want  to ever see her again.  Unless you have kids,  then you have to,  I guess.  But now...  Now, you know,  whatever holidays  they have.  She's having sex  with your father  who you now call Mike.  Can you imagine  that going over  for Christmas  at your house?  And there's dad  and your ex-wife.  Because you're,  you know,  because you're  officially divorced now,  so it's all... 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  It's fine now.  She goes to get up  to check on  cooking in the kitchen  and gives a little  smack on the ass.  Hey, sweetie.  Come here.  A little uncomfortable.  Dad gives you a wink.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, hey.  You never told me  about that thing she does.  Bargles with us.  If you find out  any more information  about this cult,  please pass it on  to us today.  Cult would be good. 
[00:33:00]  They always wind up  getting in trouble, though.  Always wind up  getting in trouble  with the cult.  They just take it too far.  Yeah.  They can't just...  You know,  status quo.  Leave it alone.  Keep your cult small,  I say.  Yeah,  you know what happens?  You bring in one person  that ruins it for everybody.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Someone's got to,  like,  rat out and actually  get some sense  in their head  and go,  this is really crazy.  Let me go to the police.  But that's human nature.  You know,  if one is good,  two is better.  If two is,  you know,  better than four is... 
[00:33:30]  Well,  awesome.  You know,  and it's the same  with these cult guys.  Yeah,  they just can't get enough.  I mean,  he's into underage women.  He gets to have sex with them.  Yeah.  Why?  Well,  I guess you got to bring in...  He's like a doctor.  I guess you got to keep bringing in  more underage women,  I guess,  to keep that whole thing going.  Oh,  because they,  well,  they do get old.  It's like a puppy.  They do grow up to look icky.  They're all cute and adorable  and then before you know it,  they're just slobbering messes  going to the bathroom on your floor.  So then you got to bring in new puppies.  Right.  In other news, 
[00:34:00]  kind of wrap it up a week  of just amazing stories.  You know,  the Austrian dad there?  Yeah.  That had his,  what,  his daughter in the basement  for how many?  18 years?  24 years.  24 years.  Right.  24 years.  His wife and his lovely,  his,  I guess,  granddaughter slash daughters  together,  daughters,  up with them.  And then the other ones  down in the basement.  This guy really ran a tight ship.  Yeah.  He had her locked away  in the basement  for a long,  long time.  He repeatedly raped her.  He had,  how many kids were there?  Seven? 
[00:34:30]  Six lived?  Yeah,  I think so.  He got her pregnant  seven times,  his own daughter.  Six of the kids lived.  What aim this guy has.  No kidding.  He's a bad,  bad guy,  but meticulous.  He doesn't play games.  At least not want,  not...  And he had  get smart type doors  leading all the way  to the chamber of horror.  Yeah.  He'd get out of one door  and there's seven more to go.  Now,  this guy will not stop talking,  which I think is awesome.  Wonderful.  Yesterday,  he was very mad 
[00:35:00]  because he said  that the media,  I'm not the beast  the media depicts me as.  He's really mad  that the media  is really,  really killing this guy  over what we have learned  so far.  And then,  here's today's  wonderful quote.  He says,  when I went into the bunker,  I brought flowers  for my daughter  and books and toys  for the children,  and I watched adventure  videos with them  while Elizabeth  was cooking  our favorite dish.  Aw.  And then I raped them.  Yeah. 
[00:35:30]  Then I raped all of them.  What books did he bring?  And there's a picture  of the son,  and they said,  what's that?  We've never seen it.  And I went,  oh yeah,  I am kind of a prick.  And then he continues,  and then we all sat  around the table  and ate together.  And then I raped them.  With one big happy family.  Yeah.  In the bunker.  Just them talking  and the terrified clatter  of their silverware.  They probably all ate silently.  Just heard click,  click, click, click, click, click,  and get to the plate.  Nobody wanted to talk. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  Because he might turn them on.  Yeah.  Probably all you try  is to say unsexy things  around them.  Oh, how's my girl?  Constipated.  Yeah, just no conversation.  Well, what could there be?  So, how was your day?  Ah, looked at the walls.  You know, because of you.  Thanks.  Thought about escaping.  Couldn't.  But you did a very good job  locking us down here  in this dungeon.  You know, I think you need  a bit of paint.  There's some chipping  on door number six. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Oh, thanks a lot.  I'll get right to that.  What a creep.  Oh, my goodness.  What a creep this guy is.  Yeah.  And someone rang the door bell,  but it was a 600-pound door,  so I couldn't open it.  Yeah.  I just kind of yelled help,  but no one heard me.  Stuck down here again.  Just another day.  Yeah.  What year is it?  I think my vocal cords  will survive maybe another month.  I've been screaming  nonstop for a decade,  and I think I've pretty much  worn them out.  Thanks to you.  Good evening. 
[00:37:00]  Ghoul.  She was very badly raped,  you see.  Yeah.  A victim of the modern age.  Poor, poor girl.  Yeah.  24 years.  As far as I'm concerned,  after a certain point,  she just got lazy.  Yeah.  How can you not figure  one way out  in 24 years?  There's got to be something  you could have done.  Yeah, I'd like to see  more of a detailed schematic  of this prison,  this dungeon.  You've got to think  there was a lot of brainwashing 
[00:37:30]  going on.  That's usually what happens  in these cases.  Yeah, that's what happens.  Right?  Like that kid from,  where the hell was she from?  Utah.  Is it smart?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She had the opportunity  to escape a few times,  but I don't know.  I think she was having fun  with those people.  Something was going on.  They're a creepy adult.  They probably smelled  under the arms a little  and they had sex with them,  but they probably let her  watch TV as late as she wanted.  Chocolate for breakfast.  Ooh.  Yeah, that's all you need.  Speaking of smelling  under the arms,  who was that 
[00:38:00]  that you were watching  Judas Priest with  that you were talking  about yesterday?  Danny.  Oh, Danny.  Yes.  She's a movie director  here at K-Rock.  Yeah, I was listening  to a little bit  of her program  and she was talking  about the fact  that you were there  watching Judas Priest  and said that  you had said  that you were a little  stinky under the arms  and she said  she actually did smell  something.  Oh, no.  But then said  she thought it was E-Rock  because E-Rock's 
[00:38:30]  the dirty one.  Thank God.  So she just like  turned on E-Rock.  I was laughing.  E-Rock, what do you  think of that?  He's too busy whispering.  I don't know  what they're talking about.  I know, I just was...  I was asking him  if he could pull  the air check.  No reason humiliating.  Yeah, get the air check.  What the hell?  Yeah.  Thank you, E-Rock.  I just thought  it was funny that, you know,  I'm home.  I'm not even, you know,  I'm not even on the air  and I could listen  to other people  goof on E-Rock.  She did smell it, though.  That's really embarrassing 
[00:39:00]  because I very rarely  pit out.  Yeah.  I just, you know,  I have very dry pits.  Dry Pits Norton  was my nickname  all through high school.  Was it?  Yeah, I self...  My nickname I gave myself.  I love it.  Bumper stickers made up.  Didn't catch on it.  Dry Pits Norton.  Jimmy, what did you say  you were?  Dry Pits Norton.  Pitted.  So pitted.  Oh, well, you mean yesterday.  Yeah, I was...  Two days ago,  I was disgusting.  Pitted.  So pitted.  Corbat!  Say bah!  Bah!  It smells like a sinkhole  from my dirty armpits. 
[00:39:30]  When you smell yourself  on a train  and think it's other people,  you reek.  Yeah, that's bad.  That is very, very bad.  The first time  I ever noticed  underarm odor,  now that we're here,  I just have a 45-minute thing  I want to cover.  I was probably like 15 or 14  and I was with my buddies  and I was wearing  a white t-shirt.  I'd never smelled myself  like that before.  You had some kind of  chemical change  in your little growing body.  Becoming a man.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Becoming a man.  Ooh.  I thought that was awful 
[00:40:00]  when I was a kid.  My mother was always  yelling at me,  clean yourself up.  You smell like chicken soup.  Wow, good call.  Ew.  Good call.  When you're eating chicken soup,  she was just familiar to you.  That was mom.  She had a lot of good sayings too  that, well, I can't say.  You smell like pot roast.  Well, you say it before.  I say it before the show.  It turned me into  the person I am today.  No kidding.  Liza.  There's a certain type of rich  that she would always say  if I had $5 in my pocket  and I would go out 
[00:40:30]  and spend it immediately  instead of socking it away.  It's a certain type of rich  that you are.  Temporarily?  Yes.  Temporarily rich,  she would call it.  What if you had to rig something?  Yes, if something had to be rigged,  maybe in the car.  That was another fine word  that she taught me.  There was,  I think they call them,  what, the Brazil nuts?  They were called something too.  The whole family actually  called them that.  Pass,  can you pass the,  they look like toes. 
[00:41:00]  So they would say,  you know,  could you pass those?  Jesus,  it was just a constant barrage.  How could I help it?  What a wonderful way  to grow up.  It was very nice.  You've got a good family.  But Liza in New Jersey  wants in here.  Liza.  Hi guys,  good morning.  Good morning, Liza.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, madam.  It almost went by  without a mention today.  People just forget.  All right.  Well, Ope,  I just wanted to tell you  about this show  I saw on MSNBC  the other day  about a cult  called The Family 
[00:41:30]  and this guy  named Rick Rodriguez  who apparently  was raised  to be the next  matriarch  of the family  by his parents  and they both  had sex with him  and he eventually  like got out  of the cult  and hunted them down.  The father  had died since then  but hunted  the mother down  to kill her.  Anyway, it was  very interesting  so I just wanted to  What happened?  Well, he didn't find her  because she ended up  being in hiding  but he found  a close confidant 
[00:42:00]  of hers  and flashed her through.  Wow.  Wow.  Wait, why the confidant?  Was the confidant  involved in the cult?  Well, he had moved  to this town  where his grandparents  lived in a nursing home  and he knew  that his mother  had been there to visit  so he picked up  his entire life  and rented this little room  just so that he could  live up the street  from the nursing home  to ever see his mother  go there  and he waited so long  and then finally  got in touch  with one of her friends  and was in the process  of finding out  where she lived  and he just lost it  and killed the confidant. 
[00:42:30]  And killed her.  Yeah.  Also, so he never  found the mother.  Is the mother still alive?  I would guess, yeah.  It's a good reality show, right?  It's great.  You know, they also had a...  Hunting down your mother  so you could kill her.  The mother's neck.  It's a nice little story  just in time for Mother's Day.  Yeah.  You know what he did  was made a video  of the last, say,  like, month of his life.  He recorded himself  every day  talking to her  and talking about  the cult and everything  and then he finally  killed himself  at the end of the documentary. 
[00:43:00]  But they also had, like,  the funeral.  At his funeral,  all of the people  that were there,  which were probably  200 people,  were all people  that had left this cult.  And, you know,  they named all of the people  that had killed themselves  that had once been  part of this cult.  I mean, it was just disgusting  and it's actually  very intriguing  but at the same time  really disturbing.  What's the name  of the documentary?  The family?  I don't...  It's called  The Rick Rodriguez Story.  Okay.  Rick Rodriguez?  Yeah, that was the kid.  That was the kid  that it was about.  Wasn't he in Menudo? 
[00:43:30]  No.  Oh.  Wow, that sounds really great.  Yeah, so check it out  if you get the chance.  Have a good weekend, guys.  All right, thank you.  Thank you.  I'll definitely check that out.  Huh?  I had more questions.  Ah, I should find out.  Can you Google Rick Rodriguez?  I want to say  that's an abusive cult.  Like, why are they  all killing themselves?  Is it like a real  sexually abusive place?  Yeah, let's...  Yeah.  Well, E-Rock's  looking up some info.  We'll go to break here  on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Don't take it down the hall.  I want to do this first.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:44:00]  Opie and Anthony's  top song of the day.  Madonna with Justin Timberlake.  Four minutes.  Time is waiting.  You've only got four minutes  to save the world.  No hesitating.  That's what I got you, girl.  Time is waiting.  We only got four minutes  to save the world.  No hesitating.  We only got four minutes.  Four minutes.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up? 
[00:44:30]  Touch Don't hit!  Hey!  Don't hit!  Al Pacino, huh?  Opie and Anthony.  I was just watching that  the other day.  Well, just before we came back,  we were looking at the  Speed Racer reviews.  Wow.  Is everyone excited?  Speed Racer opens today, huh?  Who's going?  Wow.  33% positive reviews  on RottenTomatoes.com.  Racing toward bombedom. 
[00:45:00]  That's right.  The papers here in New York  just killing this movie.  Just killing it.  People are disappointed.  They thought it was a documentary  about Harry Chapin.  Topical, huh?  Yes.  More topical than Harry.  A lot of people  have been excited  about this Speed Racer movie  and we waited for nothing, man.  I've got to be honest with you.  I didn't even care. 
[00:45:30]  I wasn't a big Speed Racer fan.  Like when I was a kid,  it was on,  I'd watch it,  but I'd rather watch  the good Warner Brothers,  you know,  see animals smashing  each other over the head  with frying pan.  I know why you weren't  and watch Speed Racer  just go,  oh, oh, oh, oh.  You weren't a big fan  because the animation sucked.  Yeah, it was horrid animation.  The idea was pretty good,  but the animation blew.  Yeah, there was a period of time  where animation  just completely sucked.  It was one still plate 
[00:46:00]  and then if the mouth  had to move,  they would just move the mouth.  So the character  would just be standing there.  Well, I don't know, Speed.  What are you going to do?  Ah!  Yeah, and then what?  They got a little  chimp-chimp thing  and a little kid  that would always  get him out of trouble  and Racer X  who was Speed's brother,  but it was a secret.  How do you remember all this?  Yeah.  Geez, for something  I really hated,  I kind of know about it.  I think I saw this twice  while I was growing up. 
[00:46:30]  Chim-chim,  I think it was.  Yeah.  But anyway,  I mentioned Speed Racer  just before we went back live  and Jimmy turned to us  and said,  I went and saw 88 Minutes,  you know.  Yeah!  And that would be  the Al Pacino movie  that was on the shelves  for I think a year  or two years.  They finally decided  to release it  to horrendous reviews.  It made, I think,  like $2 million  in the box office  with some awful number.  We've been teasing it  for a week.  We just made fun of it  for weeks.  Yeah, and you finally,  you said you had to go see it.  Only one theater  in Manhattan  is playing it anymore. 
[00:47:00]  Not the one by our place.  I had to go to 42nd Street  and watch it.  It was, you know,  the gang theater,  but it wasn't that  the theater was fine.  It's a little teeny theater.  It was like, you know,  a 60-seat theater.  And it was,  it actually could have been okay  because Pacino was subpar.  He wasn't good.  You know,  he was walking through it.  Was he yelling Pacino  or was he subdued Pacino?  Which one did we get  in this movie?  Awful Pacino.  Awful Pacino.  Even Awful Pacino  is serviceable in the movie,  but the wiggy war  was hilarious.  I wanted to take it off 
[00:47:30]  and look under it  like it was the hood of a,  it looked like the hood  of an old car.  Big hairy hood.  And everybody else  in the movie,  there was not one  other recognizable name.  It's collectively the worst,  it's the worst written movie  I've ever seen.  The story was terrible.  What's the story?  He has 88 minutes  to solve his own murder  or something.  Yeah, it's a Jack Graham.  But he's not dead yet.  No.  What?  He keeps getting  these calls  because he puts  a serial killer in jail.  It was just  quite all one-on-one.  God, that sounds like  one of those  typical garbage movies. 
[00:48:00]  But when he puts  the serial killer in jail,  the guy at the witness table,  because he's a psychologist  who testifies,  and the guy goes,  tic-toc-toc,  tic-toc-toc.  Like when he goes to jail,  that's what he says.  And you never get tired  of hearing that  every phone call  he gets years later.  And it's so bad.  And he's like,  someone calls you,  you've got 88 minutes to live.  And he's a psychologist,  a psychiatrist  who teaches a class  in a college.  And all of a sudden,  he's suspicious  of all of his students.  And he's putting  all the clues together. 
[00:48:30]  And the girl  he was involved with  wound up dead.  What's going on?  We don't know.  Oh, it's horrendous.  Wait, so he continues teaching  even though he has  88 minutes to live?  Wouldn't you like...  Sounds familiar.  Wouldn't you just like  hop a plane  to like the Caribbean  or something?  And then I think  you would add some time  onto your life.  I said, why don't you...  Now the guy has to look up  flight schedules  and who's flying  to this island  and blah, blah, blah.  Why would you continue teaching?  How about you go hang...  And then he's walking  into the garage  and his car is smashed.  72 minutes  written on his car.  So he peeks around  and he's walking  through the garage 
[00:49:00]  looking for whoever  might have a gun  to kill him.  Hey, stupid,  how about you go  to the police station  and tell the police  there's a man  who's making  inappropriate calls.  Can I hang out here  for a couple hours?  I liked the movie  when it was called Crank.  The plot of DOA?  Yeah?  It's the plot  of like five  or six different movies.  Yeah.  I'm just trying  to remember  because there was one  that sounds...  This sounds exactly like...  Oh, it's awful.  Like with the teacher  the whole thing.  Well, Crank was very similar  to that.  And being suspicious  of the students  and... 
[00:49:30]  I don't know.  At the end  it ends with some woman  being thrown off  like a ledge  or something.  This woman was...  It ended  because the killer  would like suspend you.  Oh, please don't tell me  what happens.  Wait, I...  I honestly think  I saw this.  No, you didn't.  How did I see this?  Like he would suspend you.  Yes!  The killer would suspend you.  Maybe in a drunken stupor  you staggered  into a movie theater  and you're just remembering  that you went and saw it.  I really didn't see this  and it just came out, right?  Yeah, and at the end  he saw... 
[00:50:00]  Is it a remake, maybe?  And there's two girls captive  and the one girl's hanging.  She's suspended by her foot.  Yeah!  Dude, how did I see this movie?  I think the cornball killer  gives everything away  and, well, I knew  if I did this  you'd do that  and he's like,  ah!  It was so bad.  I'm really trying  to figure this out.  Without giving away sources  this movie has been around  for a while  and someone may have...  Maybe I got, like,  a bootleg?  Maybe.  Maybe, because, I mean, 
[00:50:30]  that would be something like,  wow, an Al Pacino movie.  I gotta check this out, sure.  When did he jump the shark?  Because now when I hear  that Al Pacino's in a movie  Yeah!  I don't run out  and go see that movie anymore.  No, you used to.  It was a must-see.  But there was a time  Al Pacino, oh my God,  you gotta see this.  Not anymore, though.  What do you think, Anne?  Around Sea of Love?  Sea of Love?  When the voice changed.  No, no, because...  When the voice changed.  But even when the voice changed  he still was putting out  some quality products  or quality movies.  97, maybe,  after Devil's...  I love Devil's Advocate.  Devil's Advocate was good,  but we were just goofing on  how over-the-top he was 
[00:51:00]  with the speech  he's giving  at the end.  God, it's a big joke!  Look, don't touch!  Touch, but don't taste!  Taste, but don't swallow!  What?  Do you have to do that?  How hot was that?  He was sticking his tongue out.  How hot was that busty woman  that was supposed to be,  what, his sister or daughter  or whatever the hell  the relationship was?  Vanity!  My favorite sin!  Right. 
[00:51:30]  Is it?  And she was on the altar  all looking all busty  and bosomous.  What happened to...  That man is Luca Brazzi.  Yeah.  Yes.  He works for my father.  Well, that man's Luca Brazzi!  Works for my father!  What did he do?  What did he see that say...  He went like,  I think that's what I want to do now  for the rest of my career  is yell in a gravelly voice  instead of a little,  you know, Michael.  I have a theory on that.  Do the voice again. 
[00:52:00]  What, the younger one?  Yeah, as you do that,  your mouth is barely opening.  Yeah, barely opening.  It's almost like someone  is ashamed of their...  Now who's being naive, Kate?  I think you're doing the voice  of someone that might be ashamed  of a lot of food pockets  and smells and bad breath.  And then he went to a good dentist  and he was able to...  Thanks a lot, Doc!  Now I can open my mouth!  I'm minty fresh!  And you ruined my career! 
[00:52:30]  When you talk like this...  Yeah, when he's like that,  I'll take the gun,  I'll go in,  I'll shoot him,  I'll shoot the turkey and the cop.  That's a sign of bad breath,  I'm thinking.  Yeah!  Ah, yes.  Anyway.  And then Keanu Reeves' accent  is going in and out.  Oh.  I'm the devil's son.  And this minute he's talking  like perfect  Northern American accent.  He's killing.  He gives man instincts.  He gives you this extraordinary gift 
[00:53:00]  and then what does he do?  I swear for his own amusement,  his own private cosmic gag reason.  He sets the rules in opposition.  It's the goof of all time.  Look, but don't touch.  Touch, but don't taste.  Taste.  Don't swallow.  And while you're jumping  from one foot to the next,  what is he doing?  He's laughing his sick...  He's a tight ass. 
[00:53:30]  He's a sadist.  He's just the yelling Pacino.  I just,  I don't know why I love that stupid movie.  It is a good movie.  I really like that movie.  I, uh,  this might be a little too inside,  but you see my, uh,  my arm,  the hair standing straight up.  Yeah.  That sounded like Mel Karmazin, man.  We've been in front of that voice a few times.  How do I tell the stockholders  that my afternoon show  is going after my morning show? 
[00:54:00]  You can look,  listen,  but don't goof on him.  Right.  Goof on him,  but not on the air.  He can goof on you,  you can't goof on him.  Oh, my,  I'm not even joking.  Remember?  Remember that famous meeting  where we looked out the window  and all we saw was 666?  Yeah.  It was very much like Al Pacino's,  uh, character that day.  Oh, God.  What were you thinking?  Uh-huh.  Yelling Pacino. 
[00:54:30]  And Jeffrey Jones  was the creepy head lawyer,  you know,  old Mr. File Trade with Huey.  Oh, yeah.  Mr. Naughty Youngster File Trade.  He got his.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, what a creep.  That guy was.  Can you do Al Pacino  as, uh, as, uh,  as Mel doing the famous line  when you wake up?  What time do you wake up  in the morning  and decide...  Wait, let me get my little...  All right, you got to get  all set there.  Sorry.  Oh, you know,  it's off the cuff.  What can I tell you?  What time do you wake up  in the morning  and decide,  I'm gonna... 
[00:55:00]  Mel Calm is at?  It's a loaded question.  I can't answer that.  I don't know.  Because if I give you a time,  that means that I am indeed  thinking,  how am I gonna  Mel Calm is in?  But if I don't answer...  I don't give a time.  Right.  She's asking for a time.  Not if I think about  Mel Calm is in.  It's the question  that doesn't have  a good answer.  Those questions  are horrible.  Yeah.  Mm.  Yeah, Screaming Pacino, 
[00:55:30]  I like the subdued Pacino  better.  Yeah, of course.  Author, author.  Oof.  That was a good one.  Hi-ya.  That was between...  Well, it was way  before Scarface.  Yeah.  That was a 79, I think.  A lot of people say  incentive of a woman  was when he changed  real fast.  Andy included...  Woo-ah!  Andy.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, Andy, what's up, buddy?  Hi, how are you?  Mm-hmm.  The reason Al Pacino  started screaming  in movies 
[00:56:00]  is because he won  the Academy Award  for doing it  incentive of a woman.  No.  That was before that, dude,  because he was screaming.  Every movie,  he had a big scream scene  and he screamed  Injustice for All.  He always had a big monologue  or usually did  where he would yell.  I think Injustice for All  might have started that.  Dog Day Afternoon,  he screamed through,  which was great, though.  Yeah, but it was still  that weird voice.  But that was really,  it was younger.  It was still the younger voice.  But that sounded real.  That was real screaming.  I think it was his voice change.  I think he heard his voice.  Really?  He smokes, he's a smoker, 
[00:56:30]  and I think all that screaming,  all those takes  heard his voice.  I'm just getting warmed up.  Oh, yeah, oof.  That was brutal.  Yeah, that was brutal.  That was funny, though,  when he called for the two guys.  F you, too.  So you sat through  all 88 minutes?  Hoo-ah!  Was the movie 88 minutes?  No, it wasn't.  I wish it were.  Oh, okay.  Hoo-ah!  Hoo-ah!  Hoo-ah!  All right, I want to move on  to other things.  Sure!  Hoo-ah!  I'm a fan of man! 
[00:57:00]  Great.  Got to see that again.  It's wonderful.  We might have to do  Al Pacino Day  and get all the clubs together.  Yeah.  All right.  So gas went up again overnight.  What, another three cents  or something like that?  Yeah.  Oh, I had a whole solution  to the gas problem,  and then I forgot it.  Well, these guys...  That's something  I shouldn't have forgotten.  No.  Yeah, you could be a billionaire.  It's like a real...  Oh, I think the whole solution  was that I should buy 
[00:57:30]  futures  in gasoline.  I should buy gasoline futures,  and it will guarantee  the price goes down  because I suck  at doing that.  So I'll either make  a lot of money  because gas will go  to $200 a barrel,  but more than likely...  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  Gas back down  to $50 a barrel.  That's all right.  Yeah.  Buy futures.  That's the solution  right there.  I think I just blew  my voice out  doing Pacino.  How does he do it?  I don't know. 
[00:58:00]  I want to feed you  those grapes you're eating  like Caligula.  Anthony has a big  decadent bowl of grapes.  Feed me something  covered in lard  like Caligula.  Oh, yeah.  Nice ring.  In the Senate,  the people of Rome.  Take that, you.  Before, excuse me,  on the wedding night  when he's about to  abuse the husband  and wife,  he makes the husband  watch him  de-virginize the wife  and he goes,  open your eyes,  Proculus.  Yeah.  He's rubbing your stomach  and he stabs his stomach  and goes,  like it's a piece of meat.  Yeah.  Sick movie. 
[00:58:30]  What a gift.  Let's go to Kent,  the movie guy.  Kent.  Hey, guys.  You know,  I think Pacino  started really screaming  when he delivered  the famous  They're Pulling Me Back  in line  in Godfather Part 3  because I remember  seeing press junkets  back then  where everyone  is making him  say the line  because it was  in the trailer  and it was all over TV  and that's when  I think everyone  was like,  oh, do that again  because that movie,  even though everyone  thinks it sucks,  still won the Academy  Award for Best Picture.  What year?  Wait, Godfather 3 
[00:59:00]  won the Academy Award.  Oh, of course it didn't.  What do you...  No.  Sir, it wasn't even nominated.  You're a crazy person.  I thought Kent  was the movie guy.  What did you get won?  Huh?  Seven nominations.  Seven nominations  for Godfather 3  but it didn't win anything.  It didn't win Best Picture,  that's for sure.  How'd that get nominated  for anything?  It was terrible.  What won Best Picture  that year?  We'll find out in a second.  It wins but it was  certainly not for Best Picture.  What did Sofia Coppola  get nominated for? 
[00:59:30]  Worst Actor of the Decade.  Actress, whatever.  Thank you, Kent.  That might be where  it all began though,  that famous line  for Godfather 3.  That doesn't seem like  it's that...  I mean, I know it's old but...  I'm telling you,  it was before that.  Yeah, I think it was before that.  He was yelling  in Sea of Love.  That was the first time  I noticed it.  Not as over the top  as it became  but it had changed.  All right.  The gas story  is going to have to wait  but gas has finally  gotten to a point  where people are doing 
[01:00:00]  outrageous things  because they've got  to survive out there.  Yep.  Very expensive.  So we'll get into  that story in a few minutes.  I hit the $80 mark  over the $80 mark  for the first time  pumping gas.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Are we doing  our penny-a-gallon  promotion or what?  We should.  This station is willing  to do penny-a-gallon  because all these  dopey radio stations  doing the call letters  are like,  screw that.  Let's get right to the bottom  of a penny-a-gallon.  Yep.  I mean,  free gas is whatever. 
[01:00:30]  I really want people  to go and hand us  like 20 cents  to fill up their car.  Penny-a-gallon.  That would be hilarious  just collecting pennies  all morning.  When are we doing this?  Please don't.  A penny-a-gallon.  It's hacky.  I agree.  That's what people are saying.  I like $10 a gallon.  I like $10 a gallon, too.  I want $10 a gallon.  Ten bucks a gallon,  but today only.  It's not going to be hacky  because we're going to  pick a gas station  that completely shuts  down this city.  Hey, Reverend Al.  Oh, sorry.  Oops.  I want $10 a gallon. 
[01:01:00]  All right,  we'll figure out  our gas promotion,  but ours is going to be  a lot different  than all the other.  Oh, and Steve from Bayshore  is saying the station's  already doing  a penny per rundown.  Poor guy doesn't  make any money.  That's hilarious.  Funny writer, man.  Yes.  I saw him at FH Riley's.  He goes,  you know how you joked  about me collecting cans?  I'm getting very close  to that point.  Is he not getting his money?  It's not.  Well, first of all,  even if they do pay him  for the rundowns  on onaradio.com,  work is a little tough  in his regular life. 
[01:01:30]  He's not getting much work.  And again,  you're not going to become  a millionaire  writing rundowns,  but it's...  I think they're finally paying him,  but that's not enough  to pay the bills  and what he does  for a real living.  There's not a lot of jobs  out there right now.  No one is spending money  out there.  So speaking of movies,  we'll do the gas thing next,  but...  And also we'll do  the corpse story,  which is just  the story of the day.  It's a fun one.  Yeah, so stick around, please.  What Happens in Vegas  also comes out today.  Ooh.  Another movie  getting really bad reviews.  No. 
[01:02:00]  Ashton Kutcher's  latest book.  This guy's making  bomb after bomb  after bomb,  but you know what?  Is it financed  by his broad?  Is she the producer  of this one, too?  Is that what's going on?  Yeah, she winds up  being the producer  of a lot of the stuff  he does.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, that sounds fun, though.  With him and Cameron Diaz,  you know,  something happens in Vegas.  It stays there, too, though.  Allegedly, I don't know.  I can't wait to see it.  I know.  Won't it stay?  Won't it stay?  Who knows?  They both smile a lot.  Thank God. 
[01:02:30]  It looks like a fun rock.  I bet it all works out  in the end, too.  Oh, come on.  From your lips  to God's ears.  What happens in Vegas  stays in Vegas.  Worst slogan ever,  unless you come up  with a worse one.  Or unless you're  a tranny hunter.  No, no, I'm speculating.  No, but that's the funny  part about that whole thing  because, like, yeah,  it should be for some  horrific thing you're  doing in Vegas,  but it's because you  drank a little too much  and maybe pulled  an all-night with the gals,  you know.  Yeah.  It's not hacksawing 
[01:03:00]  that hooker apart  in the bathtub  of some seedy hotel.  As you're wearing  the bunny suit.  Yeah, this guy  has to stay in Vegas.  Right.  So you got the  chainsaw sound effect?  This has to stay in Vegas.  What happens in Vegas  stays in Vegas.  It's covered in blood.  Chopping that hooker up.  Yeah, that's...  Now, now.  Now it's got to stay in Vegas.  Now I understand the slogan.  Oh, I had one too many  sea breezes.  Ooh, crazy me. 
[01:03:30]  I hope this stays in Vegas.  What if the kids find out?  But if you're just  a bunch of broads  trying to live the  sex-in-the-city lifestyle  for a weekend,  please don't use  what happens in Vegas  stays in Vegas.  Yeah.  Oh, you know what else  stays in Vegas?  Your last period.  Betty Sue had a little  too much to drink last night.  She got a little wild.  Did she?  Went to a strip club.  She was gyrating  all over the guy.  Wow.  Wow, that's crazy.  Yeah, she slipped 
[01:04:00]  a 10 down as a G-string.  Ooh, keep that  under your hat.  Wow, don't mention that  when she gets back  to the office.  When we get back to...  Sassy girl.  When we get back  to Des Moines,  let's not talk about this.  Oh, stays in Vegas,  right girls?  Oh!  Got a little crazy out there.  Let's keep it  among ourselves.  Throw a toaster  in the bathtub  when they're in there.  They're all giggling  around the cooler.  Yeah.  At work.  What happened, girls?  Oh, you know.  You know,  what happens  in Vegas, stays in Vegas.  Right, Charlene?  Oh, stop. 
[01:04:30]  Stupid older broads.  Office biddies.  They stink.  Fat legs crammed  in a slack.  Nothing worse  than fat legs  in a slacks.  Sensible shoes.  Tucked and raging.  Were you cougar hunting  in Vegas?  Wow.  Ugh.  Cougars.  Dried up skanks.  Shut up.  You want the trailer  for What Happens  in Vegas, stays in Vegas?  Who doesn't?  Do I?  I don't want to marry you,  Joy, but I'm leaving you. 
[01:05:00]  Well, I mean,  this is my place,  so technically  you would be the one  that has to leave.  Joy just got done.  Oh, there's the...  I hate the formula  of the movie trailer.  Horrendous.  I loved the bad 70s movie trailers  because it was all action.  Yeah.  Suspense.  Well, no one happened.  This is the guy...  Charlton Heston  in A Planet of Apes.  Well, he...  Like, that was rated M.  Well, this is the...  For monkeys.  This is the new guy,  by the way. 
[01:05:30]  You know, we lost  in a small town.  Yeah.  You know, that guy  was awesome.  Now it's this guy.  Now it's...  That's so much fun.  He just sounds like  he's smiling as he's talking  because it's so funny.  But I hate that...  You're right.  The formula,  it stinks to high heaven  because it'll go...  And that's where...  It'll go...  Boom, boom, ba-boom  and the music is up.  Yeah.  Joke.  Yeah, yeah.  The formula stinks.  Watch how it stops.  They let you know  the joke's coming.  Yeah.  The joke's coming.  Silence. 
[01:06:00]  Joke.  Back into the music  and the dialogue.  It stays.  Joke in Vegas.  Oh, it's so bad.  Technically, you would be  the one that has to leave.  Joy just got dumped.  Jack, you're fired.  Don't get me wrong.  You're like a son to me.  Dad, I am your son.  Jack.  There it is.  That was it.  What happened?  Just what Jimmy said.  What happened?  What happened?  Music stops.  Right.  Joke.  Right.  Back into the music.  Only retards can enjoy this,  so you have to show them  when the joke is coming 
[01:06:30]  with the music.  Yeah.  Jack, you're fired.  Don't get me wrong.  You're like a son to me.  Dad, I am your son.  Jack just got canned.  Here's the one place  where you can step up  and be a man.  Community college?  Where can you go  if you can forget  all your troubles?  Vegas.  Vegas!  Vegas!  They were two strangers.  I'm not usually  this much fun!  Ew!  Ew!  I would only like that  if she was laying  under five guys  in a circle  and had a cracker  on her face.  Cameron Diaz. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, see,  she's quite conservative  until she gets to Vegas.  Whoa!  Oh, then she's crazy.  It all comes out.  She wants her hair down.  Whoa, watch out.  Front, the back,  and the face.  By the way,  she's yelling that line  from the sunroof  of a limo  because...  Oh, that's fun.  I usually  this much fun!  ...looking for a night  to remember.  What they got  was a morning after. 
[01:07:30]  They'll never forget.  Uh-oh, why?  I'm gonna need a divorce.  Absolutely!  We'll always have Vegas!  That was my quarter!  I put the quarter  in the slot!  What's mine  is yours, baby.  We're married now,  remember?  Uh...  That makes my kidneys hurt.  Yeah. 
[01:08:00]  See?  Wow.  They got so crazy  in Vegas  that they got married.  One sec!  Yeah.  Not much fun in Vegas.  No.  And then I guess  somehow they both  put a coin in a machine  and won the jackpot  and now they're stuck  with a situation  because they were  just gonna get divorced  and be done  with this whole  Vegas experience.  There's more.  But now they're  connected with each other  because they won  the big jackpot.  Oh, Opie,  wait till you hear  Dennis...  Wait till you hear  Dennis Miller  as the judge.  Oh, no.  I am freezing  the $3 million 
[01:08:30]  and sentencing you  to six months  hard marriage.  Oh, no!  No!  Oh, no!  That would happen.  That would happen.  Six months  of hard marriage.  Of hard marriage.  Yeah, a bit  clostical.  What?  At least they used  words we understand.  Yeah.  It's like when  the Peloponnesians...  Yeah.  What?  The who?  The what?  We get it.  You're smarter than us. 
[01:09:00]  Hard marriage.  Objection!  Welcome home, sweetheart.  If you want me to report  that you're both  working on your marriage,  you're gonna actually  have to do that.  I can get joy  to be the one  to end marriage.  Not only would you  get out of the marriage...  You will also get  the full $3 million.  Hi.  Would you mind  if we waited in here  until the locks?  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  What?  I bet this ends  with them actually  falling in love  with each other  and staying married.  Oh, no. 
[01:09:30]  Why?  You're ruining it.  Ah, sorry.  I disagree.  I'm gonna take another guess.  All right, what do you think?  I'm gonna guess  that they get  the money  and then he takes her  to a lake  and ties a rock  around her neck  and throws her  and the script supervisor  overboard.  That sounds better, see?  That's fine.  We're all laughing.  It's a comedy.  Yeah.  I would love that.  How hilarious  would that be, though?  At the end,  when they're married  and all of a sudden  they're on a romantic thing 
[01:10:00]  and then he just chokes  and puts an anvil  around her neck  and throws her overboard.  It just ends horrifically  without a hint of humor  or not even dark humor.  Just a horrific,  murderous ending.  Why couldn't you do that,  though, in Hollywood?  I don't understand  why every stupid comedy  has to have a nice message.  Just caves her head in  with a rock  as she's laying there.  And then just,  and then he throws her overboard  and then she goes away  and then he goes,  he puts the motorboat  back to the shore  and he's singing  a tiddly-dee-dee-dee-dee 
[01:10:30]  and then the credits  start rolling  and everyone's disappointed.  Everyone leaves  just wondering  what the hell  they just saw.  What was that?  I've thought for forever  that somebody in Hollywood  has got to step up  and make one of these  cute comedies like this.  It's pretty much  what you guys are saying,  but I have thought this forever  and then turn it into  a horrific,  horrific horror movie.  Horrid.  Where people are like,  what the hell happened?  What just happened?  This was a cutesy.  Why aren't they brave enough  to do that?  I think the youth of America  would eat up something like that. 
[01:11:00]  I can tell you why.  I believe at least.  Jamie Kennedy's coming in today  and he did a really cool documentary  on, it's called Heckler,  on critics.  And there's one part in there  where they say,  where Jamie is talking about,  they say focus groups  are the death  of everything.  And these stupid focus groups,  I guarantee you,  wouldn't like that  and they would take it out.  And they wouldn't take a chance  that the people would like it.  Focus groups kill radio stations too,  by the way.  They're so bad.  Just get rid of all that crap.  Because what you do  is you remove the instinct 
[01:11:30]  of the performers  and the creators of the movie  or the radio show  who know what's funny  and you get a small group of people  and you have to go by  what they say.  It's enraging.  It's too bad.  Waited in here  until the locksmith comes.  There was a hot girl party  going on in my living room.  Dude, it's a trap.  No, this happens.  No, it doesn't happen.  A comedy about two people  with three million reasons  to stay together.  He doesn't seem so bad,  Uncle Jack.  Wait, why is a dollar a reason? 
[01:12:00]  I guess, like,  so they have to stay married  and if someone screws up the marriage  then the other person  gets the money, right?  Yeah.  So they're trying to set each other up  because this scene  is, like, two really hot girls  just showing up at his apartment.  Yeah.  Or he's arrested  for, like,  that guy in the movie  with the other pouring bleach  in her soda  and giving it to her.  Yeah.  And her throat burns.  Another wonderful story today.  I believe this.  No.  You're falling for your wife,  you idiot. 
[01:12:30]  Keep your eyes on the brides.  Or for worse.  You didn't need to look real  so it seemed like she was beating you.  Jack, what happened to your face?  I'm supposed to line up the hand towels  just so,  and I didn't,  I didn't do it.  I'm sorry.  I deserve it.  What happened?  There it was.  Oh, the guy didn't do it right.  Now, that would actually be funny 
[01:13:00]  if she had a black eye  and said,  what's wrong?  And then she said,  I'm supposed to do something  and didn't do it.  Right.  Exactly.  That's the joke,  but they're too scared  to make that joke  in Hollywood.  You can't make fun  of domestic violence.  All right.  After the break,  he's standing by.  I see you, Kenny.  Traffic and weather together  on the 8th  with Club Soda Kenny  after the break,  but first,  we go to the FU line.  Thanks for calling  the Opie and Anthony FU line. 
[01:13:30]  Here's the latest batch  of FUs.  You have six  new voice messages.  First voice message.  Yeah, I'd like to send out  a big FU  to have a low-income  deadbeats  living in my properties.  Get jobs,  you rotten.  Next message.  I want to send out  a big FU  to my husband,  David,  because every time  we don't want to upset,  he makes me.  Next message.  Hey, I'd like to give  a big FU  to my ex-girlfriend.  You string me along  for a year  and then you tell me  you just want to break up.  Die, you FU. 
[01:14:00]  Next message.  I'd like to give  an FU to Jocelyn  who sent me nasty emails  accused my husband  of stupid.  You'll get yours  because karma  is good, baby.  FU.  Next message.  I would like to say  FU to Tom,  my son's father,  who decided  he's not an alcoholic  even after he went  to rehab  and f***ed his hands  on a regular basis.  Next message.  This is Josh  from Pittsburgh.  I want to send  a big f*** you  out to Lisa  from Long Island  who didn't think  the dead horse jokes 
[01:14:30]  were funny.  Lee!  F*** you!  End of new messages.  Call the Opie  and Anthony  FU line  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you  and goodbye.  It's the Opie  and Anthony  show  on this Friday.  Actually,  Friday is good,  right?  Right?  Right?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Phone number  877-212-O-N-A. 
[01:15:00]  He's making his way  into the studio,  ladies and gentlemen.  And he has  a big intro.  Here it is.  Traffic and weather  on the 8's  with Club Sorta Kenny.  Hello, Kenny.  Good morning, everyone.  Hold on a minute, Kenny.  Sorry about that.  Good morning, G.H.  What's up, Kenny?  You said today  Friday is good  but I beg to differ 
[01:15:30]  with you.  Not today.  Not this Friday.  Why?  What's going on?  Well, it's the time  everybody's been waiting for.  It's me,  Club Sorta Kenny  with the Opie  and Anthony show  Traffic and Weather  on the 8's.  Are you getting  a big head  about your bit  that's taken off?  I'm a star.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Gotta keep you grounded.  Who's better than me?  Besides you guys.  I don't know how  I'm gonna hold an umbrella  for a 6'5 goon  in the rain.  That'll never happen, G.H.  You're always first 
[01:16:00]  in my heart.  So you got  some traffic and weather?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And speaking of the weather,  when the weather's bad,  everyone's IQ lowers  and some people  can't drive  to save their lives.  That's true.  So they cause accidents  and die.  So just expect  the worst today  and say your prayers  so maybe the odds  will be in your favor.  And this morning  when I was driving  to work,  every accident  I passed,  I just pointed  and laughed 
[01:16:30]  as I went up  the shoulder  around them.  In New York City,  the bridges  and tunnels  are jammed.  And not just  because of the weather,  because of stupid people  who don't have  easy pass.  They're a major  contributor  to the delays.  Contributor?  Yeah.  Those people  should just get  explosive diarrhea  while they're waiting  to pay the tolls.  That's a bit harsh.  I'm just reporting  the facts.  They should.  Yeah.  I agree. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  In Suffolk County,  there's an overturned  vehicle at the intersection  of Nagel Lane  and Dove-Katat Lane.  Early morning rollovers  are really funny  because in addition  to being upside down,  you gotta deal  with your eyeballs  being melted  by the popping,  popping, piping,  the piping hot coffee  that popped out  of the cup holder  and flew in your face.  That is something  you'd get in a morning 
[01:17:30]  rollover  than you wouldn't  do it a lot.  See?  I just report the facts.  In Marlboro,  New Jersey,  there's an accident  on Route 9 northbound  and a fuel spilled  all over the road  and you know  that's my favorite  because when there's fuel,  there's fire  and when there's fire,  there's people  burning to death.  And don't you just love  the smell of barbecue?  In Buffalo,  a garbage truck 
[01:18:00]  plowed into a nursing home  killing most  of the residents.  What?  Yeah.  And there are reports  that some of the family  members are glad  that they don't have  to house those burdens  anymore.  Wow!  Kenny!  I understand, yes.  And here's a traffic  related news story.  Yesterday in Florida,  a box truck ran  a red light  and crashed into  a funeral procession.  Crushing the hearse  and the limo  with the grieving family. 
[01:18:30]  Everyone died  except the dead guy.  I hope they got  enough burial plots.  And now let's switch  gears to the weather.  Okay.  Baltimore,  Boston,  New York,  Philly,  heavy rain  and hopefully flooding.  Chicago,  Indianapolis,  Kansas City,  Minneapolis showers,  Cincinnati,  Denver,  Memphis, 
[01:19:00]  Nashville,  thundershowers  and hopefully  deadly lightning.  And because of the  East Coast storms,  expect airport delays  from Boston to D.C.  You know,  ideally planes take off  and land into the wind.  But weather like today  causes strong crosswinds,  which makes certain runways  unusable.  And low visibility  and heavy rain  increases stopping distance  on runways, 
[01:19:30]  which requires  grading spaces  between flights.  It's been a while  since we had a plane crash.  Oh, God.  And what,  that bums out?  It's just traffic  and weather  on the 8s  on the O.B.  and Anthony show  with Club Soda Kenny.  Thank you.  Have a nice day.  Wait, Kenny,  we got a fan of yours  on the line.  Chad in Philly.  Yes, Chad.  Oh, my God.  Get him off the radio.  I can't take it.  Hey, Chad, 
[01:20:00]  I hope you got an umbrella.  I want to mush your face  into the rooftop  like a silly cop.  That's hurtful.  I'm doing a public service.  All right, Chad.  Thanks.  I thought we'd get  a little more out of you.  On the irony of him  complaining about anyone  not having E-ZPass,  I'd like to leap across  this console  and just land on his hair.  I had to yell at Kenny  for so long  to get E-ZPass.  I'm like,  why don't you get it?  I don't know.  What good is it?  They could track you. 
[01:20:30]  Exactly.  Who's they?  Everyone knows where you are.  You talk on the radio.  I had a Kenny moment yesterday.  You know,  there's some serious stuff  going on  at the house  and my girl's like,  you know,  trying to tell me something  that's pretty serious  and I'm like openly laughing  and she's looking at me.  I'm like,  well,  the timing was horrible.  And she goes,  why?  I go,  come over here.  And I think it's on Wack Bag.  They have a picture of Kenny,  his face,  but instead of hair, 
[01:21:00]  it's,  what's the one flower  where you,  Oh,  dandelion?  Dandelion.  Yeah,  dandelion hair.  It is the funniest picture.  Could you get that  for onaradio.com today there,  E-Rock?  It made me laugh openly,  Kenny.  It's very flattering.  And very dry,  your hair.  Yeah.  All right,  moving on.  I didn't even get that  for a second.  Yeah,  you got to see his picture.  I think it's in the,  uh,  we love Kenny.  Club sort of Kenny  appreciation thread,  maybe up over there. 
[01:21:30]  Right,  right there.  Yeah.  Try to find that picture  for Jimmy.  Wait six months.  We should start rotating  Kenny in and out  with other guys  doing traffic.  He sucks.  Look,  look,  look at this.  It was funny at first.  Look at this picture.  I know it is good.  It's not a dandelion,  it's a pussy willow.  Huh?  Are you really?  No,  I think that's a dandelion.  It turns into it.  Yeah,  that's what a dandelion  turns into.  Oh,  really?  Or is that?  I don't know.  I look terrific.  Yeah,  we're going to get that picture  up on onaradio.com  so everyone can enjoy it.  Oh,  all right,  all right.  You know,  yeah. 
[01:22:00]  Good job.  That's a dandelion.  Whoever came up with that.  Oh,  sorry.  Hey,  gas prices,  of course,  just out of control.  Anthony paid $80  for the first time.  I remember when we were  paying,  what,  $50 to fill up  and we thought  that was outrageous.  Now,  $80?  80 bucks to fill up  and I wasn't even  on dead empty,  so.  Unbelievable.  There's problems  going on.  It's going to be  no time at all,  100 bucks.  Yes,  Jimmy.  I got the promo.  All right,  yeah,  we need something.  Gas.  I got it.  We need a help.  92 cents a gallon.  Well, 
[01:22:30]  that goes with the  call line.  Yes,  exactly.  That's what every  radio station does.  Right,  but you can only buy it  if you have a lit book  of matches in your hand.  Just pump your own gas  with matches in your hand.  People don't like  our penny a gallon  promotion.  No,  10 bucks a gallon,  I'm telling you.  Let's do $10 a gallon?  That's hilarious.  $10.  Just to have the K-Rock van  and no one showing up.  Yeah,  who would show up?  $10 today only.  That would be...  You don't want to give them 
[01:23:00]  a bargain.  Don't give them a reason  to line up.  Give them a reason  to drive by and go,  what is this?  What is going on?  Crap.  $10 a gallon.  Big promotion  and just run it  as if you are doing  penny a gallon.  Hire a band  and no one's there.  Ah,  Shut up.  Get off the stage. 
[01:23:30]  Fat mama singing along.  Yeah.  Well,  I'm not surprised  at this story.  Gas price is very,  very high.  This is what people  are doing.  The pain of the pump  is extending  beyond the gas station.  Authorities in Maryland  are now investigating  several cases  of gas thieves  simply going up  to cars parked  in driveways  and siphoning fuel  from the tanks.  In one case,  a car owner  was awakened  in the middle  of the night  when his car alarm  started going off.  They had a can  and that's all I've seen  was the can  so I don't know  if they had a hose  or what,  they must have took it 
[01:24:00]  with them,  but they just left  the can sitting there.  And police officials  say it's not just  unleaded gas  that's the goal  of thieves.  In one case,  police found a gas line  of a school bus  punctured.  The diesel fuel  priced at more than  $4 a gallon  simply gone.  Further investigation  revealed that  approximately 30 gallons  of diesel fuel  had been removed.  This is brilliant  and this is going  to be widespread  within a month.  You think?  Of course.  People can't afford  to fill up their cars  so they're going  to do whatever  it takes 
[01:24:30]  so they get  a tank full of gas  so they can go to work.  And it's just  sitting out there.  Just sitting there.  It's in every car  out there.  It's brilliant.  And then there's  going to be a new business  where everyone's  going to be locking up  they're locking gas caps.  Gas caps and all that.  That was a big thing  back in the 70s  I think when there  was a gas shortage  and the price  was overinflated.  Locking gas caps,  people siphoning  lines at the gas station.  Yeah.  Or just poking a hole  in the gas tank. 
[01:25:00]  I can't wait  to hear the stories  of idiots  that go to use  a little drill  and it heats up  a little bit.  Yeah, don't use drills.  Whammo.  Do the siphon thing.  It's the safest.  Well, how about this?  Instead of a locking gas tank  you go to Smartway.  You just hire someone  to sit there in a booth  all night and watch your car.  There you go.  You can do that.  That's crazy idea, Jim.  My new character.  No humor whatsoever.  Exactly.  There was also  those things,  those spring things  that used to drop down  your gas line there 
[01:25:30]  and you couldn't get  a siphon hose  down in there.  I'm not sure  if nowadays  because it seems like  they just stopped  doing that after a while  because nobody  siphoned gas.  Yeah, this is going  to start a new business.  The story continues.  These are just  crimes of the times,  of course.  Police say these new thefts  are simply crimes  of the times  and there's no  what you can do  to stop it.  But experts say  if your fuel tank  is punctured  and you don't know  about it,  it can be  extremely dangerous.  When there is  a gas leak  and you try  to start the car  up,  it's very dangerous. 
[01:26:00]  It might catch on fire.  Nationally,  the AAA says  the average price  for a gallon  of unleaded fuel  is about $3.65.  That's $0.30  more a gallon  than a month ago  and $0.60  higher than this time  last year.  Unbelievable.  So, yeah,  people are going to do  whatever it takes  to get their gas.  That was a good news report  except I don't like  the fact that  these experts say  that having a punctured  gas tank is dangerous.  Yeah, thanks.  You can pretty much  be a novice  and make that assumption.  You mean just kind of  driving around  with flammable liquid  pouring out of your vehicle  perhaps on a hot tailpipe? 
[01:26:30]  Would be a bad thing.  That could be dangerous?  That would be a bad thing.  Thank you for that PSA.  A grammar school student says.  Grammar school?  Yeah, you don't need  expert in that sentence.  Yeah, you know.  I don't know how people  are surviving out there.  I don't know, you know.  I mean, we're lucky.  We make a very good living.  I feel very lucky.  People know that by now  and we're very fortunate.  You hear horror stories, man.  These people are like,  I can't afford $60, $70, $80  to fill up my tank.  Yeah.  Get a Prius. 
[01:27:00]  A Prius.  The other day I read  that some kid got hit by a Prius  because he didn't hear it coming.  That's the problem.  That seems to be a little problem  with those vehicles sometimes  when they're in electric golf cart mode.  I'm so sorry your child was hit  by a bear driving a small vehicle.  He was hit by the car.  It was fine.  But then he was mauled by the driver.  Steve C.  I want to photograph him  without a shirt for insurance purposes. 
[01:27:30]  Yes.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, wait.  Oh, I've hit somebody.  Let me.  Are you okay, son?  Get on my lap.  Let's go.  I'll just sit here a while.  Because I have that effect too.  And now I'll take off.  Bye.  There he goes.  Steve.  In his Prius.  I think we can sneak one more story in  before we take a break  and get Jamie Kennedy in here. 
[01:28:00]  Jamie Kennedy has a very interesting documentary  called The Heckler.  The Heckler.  Really good, man.  I saw it.  Jimmy saw it.  And yeah, I think we'll have a fine discussion  with Jamie Kennedy about The Heckler.  Yes.  A lot of relatable stuff in this documentary.  That's for sure.  Absolutely.  But before that, we got a teenager story.  Teenagers digging up a corpse.  Yeah.  And listen to what they used the corpse for.  Or maybe not.  As we get an error 400 message. 
[01:28:30]  What does that mean?  Error 400?  Yeah.  Let me check the book.  Oh, no.  An error 400 message.  Is that, no, 358 is, 358 error is,  there's an incompetent trying to help you.  Teasing, of course.  All right, here we go.  Teasing, of course, then.  It's working in CD number one,  but not CD number two.  For the record.  In Texas, three teenagers have been arrested  and accused of abusing a corpse.  Houston police say they dug up a grave, 
[01:29:00]  removed the skull from a coffin,  and then they used it to smoke marijuana.  Two of the three suspects,  17-year-old Matthew Gonzalez and Kevin Jones,  were arrested Wednesday.  A 16-year-old was turned over  to the juvenile justice system.  The grave apparently belonged to a male  buried in the 1920s.  1920s.  Smoking marijuana from the skull.  Out of a skull.  How do you do it?  Like, where do you put the doobie?  There's too many holes to the doobie. 
[01:29:30]  There's too many holes.  There's too many holes to clog up.  And especially in a skull that old.  But you just, it's amazing as a human,  picture your own life right now.  You never think that people who aren't born yet  are going to be holding your skull.  Someday.  Just doing drugs out of it.  Listen, listen up.  That was my skull.  I'm so wasted.  Yeah.  A little Jeff Spicoli.  Yeah, that never hurts anybody.  Where do you think you put it? 
[01:30:00]  And the eyeball is too big.  The nose, that's all too big when you're just a skull.  This is what sucks about the news.  Like, this is really interesting.  You want to know how they did it.  I want to know how you smoke pot from a skull.  There's no, like, real ear hole in a skull.  It's kind of...  How do you do it?  I would think.  What do you think, Danny?  And it's all open on the bottom, Danny?  You probably gotta bring tape, I'm assuming,  to tape up some holes.  Tape it up?  It takes the whole smoking out of a skull thing.  Because I guess the...  Kind of ruins it.  The logical thing would be to, like, 
[01:30:30]  tape up the eye holes and, I guess, the mouth.  Drill a hole in the top of the head.  Too much ball.  Drill in holes, though.  And then pull through the nose.  That's too much work for a pothead.  There isn't really an ear hole in a skull.  All that stuff kind of goes behind by your jaw and everything.  Yeah.  Like, so...  I don't know.  I'm thinking...  You gotta hold something like a carburetor, you know?  The nose and the eyes.  Maybe you, like, hold it like a carburetor.  Then you put the...  You have your friend, because you got a friend with you.  He's gotta hold the joint in the kid's mouth. 
[01:31:00]  It's too much work.  Maybe in that little hole where your spinal cord comes through.  All right, yeah.  The little hole where your spinal cord comes through.  You shove the joint in there.  And then you suck in one eye.  And you use the other eye and the nose as a carburetor.  They probably weren't even using a joint.  They were probably just, like, lighting, like, buds,  like, directly onto the skull.  Okay, yeah, maybe that.  I was thinking kind of using it like a...  You could turn the skull, like, yeah, 
[01:31:30]  where the nose is kind of popping up.  And you could pack that, maybe.  Speaking of packing.  I don't know.  Help us out, Travis.  Packing an eye socket?  The news story that I read said that they used it as a bong.  Yeah, that's what we're getting at.  So how do you do that?  I thought maybe they were, like, putting a joint in its mouth or something.  No, I knew the whole time that it was a bong.  Okay, use it like a bong.  But how do you do it?  So then you've got to use the eye as a bong.  That's what I would think.  The eye socket is your bong.  And then you suck it out of the little thing that the spinal cord comes out of. 
[01:32:00]  And you use the nose as a carburetor.  I have no idea.  How do you smoke out of a skull?  You've got to go and try it.  Danny's right.  You've got to tape certain parts up.  Tape it.  Or block them up with paper.  Because there's just too many ways for air to escape.  You need to create some kind of air pressure in there.  Yeah.  The bottom part of the head.  I mean, where the head is.  You're kind of open on the bottom, right?  Under the skull?  No, it's kind of, like, sealed there. 
[01:32:30]  And then you've got, like, that little part where the spinal cord starts coming out.  They should do this on Mythbusters.  Yeah.  Yeah, I like it.  This would be a great Mythbusters.  All right.  You know what?  Why don't we dig up a body?  All right.  And get a skull in here Monday.  And then we'll try to figure it out ourselves.  Let's just kill E-Rock.  Chop his head off.  Get some acid.  We'll clean the meat off his head.  Oh, my God.  Imagine de-meating his fat head.  We'll boil him all weekend.  De-meating his fat head. 
[01:33:00]  How nice it would be to slice it off like just big pieces of roast beef.  Get the water boiling.  We're going to need it all weekend.  Get it nice and tender so you can just pick it off.  Yeah.  You throw a skin on the ground and you see the animals just ignoring it.  It's rotted.  We've got to get Jamie.  Sorry.  Jamie Kennedy is standing by.  We're going to talk to him next about his new movie, The Heckler.  Very, very interesting stuff.  And they interview a ton of guys that have done our show over the years.  Yeah, I know.  Why didn't they interview you? 
[01:33:30]  Why would they?  I assumed you were asked and you just were busy or something.  No.  But I actually, in fairness, think he did most of it in L.A.  He doesn't know me.  Yeah, there's a lot of L.A. guys in the documentary.  Why would they?  We really, really liked it.  We'll talk to Jamie Kennedy next.  He's also performing, by the way, the Times Square Art Center.  It's on 8th Avenue.  It's the old Laugh Factory.  It's right in Times Square tonight and tomorrow night, Friday and Saturday, 8 and 10 o'clock.  It's not the Laugh Factory anymore?  No, they lost the name.  They were only licensing the name and Jamie was involved with it.  But, no, you know, I think people who own that building, you know, knows. 
[01:34:00]  Whoa, hey.  They own Show World.  Oh, yeah.  They're just trying to use it.  6 and A on the.  Well, you know.  You know.  You know.  All right, but Jamie's going to be there tonight.  Yes, 8 and 10 o'clock tonight and tomorrow.  All right.  I want to play this before we go there, Iraq.  We'll be an Anthony show.  We'll be an Anthony show.  We'll be an Anthony's top song of the day.  George Streets.  I saw God today.  I've read to church.  I've read the book.  I know he's here, but I don't look near as often as I should. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, I should.  His fingerprints are everywhere.  I just slow down to stop and stare.  Open my eyes, and man, I swear.  I saw God today.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, let's get right back into this. 
[01:35:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  In studio, Jamie Kennedy.  Jimmy was saying before the break, Jamie Kennedy's performing live at the Times Square Arts Center.  Tonight and tomorrow, two shows, both nights.  You can get tickets through TimesSquareArtsCenter.com, right?  Or TimesSquareArtsCenter.com.  Or 212-586-7829 if you buy a phone.  Very, very nice.  You got a new movie out called The Heckler?  Yeah.  Now we got to make believe we didn't talk to you for the last five minutes. 
[01:35:30]  Coming out.  It's coming out September 9th.  September 9th?  Yeah.  Well, that's our DVD release, but we're going to probably do a New York and L.A. release.  Just like a little theatrical.  Yeah, our boy Roland gave us copies of The Heckler, and Jimmy and I really, really enjoyed it.  First of all, I want to thank you for watching it, because you know how many times you give stuff to people and they don't watch it.  You guys actually watched it, and you liked it.  That's awesome.  Thank you.  You can always tell when the first question is, so tell us about it.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, there's other stuff that they give us in advance, and then we're stuck, because we already booked the guests. 
[01:36:00]  And we're like, so tell us about it.  Yeah, like, Jimmy, why am I doing the same exact joke?  I'm an idiot.  What an idiot!  I'm an idiot.  Yeah.  Oh, by the way, real quick, Boogie Nights.  You said you were in Boogie Nights and they deleted your scenes?  No, here's what's happened.  I actually got a part in Boogie Nights, and I got a part in As Good As It Gets.  I don't know if you saw As Good As It Gets.  It's my part.  I had actually a big part, but it got cut down to one word, where I say, yo. 
[01:36:30]  And then I beat up Greg Kinnear, I hit him with the lamp.  Really?  Yeah, and he was the gay guy.  Yeah, yeah, of course.  And in Boogie Nights, I had the actual part of the guy that had sex with Heather Graham in the back of a limo.  Oh, really?  And Randall kicks me with a roller skater.  They conflicted, so I had to pick a choice.  It was like two months of a movie in New York or two days on Boogie Nights.  So I chose As Good As It Gets.  So I ended up saying, yo, but in the other one, it would have been cool to be kicked with a roller skate by Burt Reynolds.  That was the douchey guy that she went to school with or something? 
[01:37:00]  That would have been you.  You know what's weird?  Okay, so check it out.  So I get the part.  I couldn't do it.  My roommate, at the time I'm living with, I say, you should go in.  He goes in.  He gets it.  Isn't that weird?  Well, that was him.  That's him.  That keeps you up at night, I'm thinking.  That was a huge movie.  I know.  I'm sorry, but that's got to keep you up at night.  A Nicholson scene.  A Nicholson movie.  A Nicholson scene was good to have, too.  But you know what?  Good choice by you, of course, going with As Good As It Gets. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, because Burt Reynolds hated that movie.  He didn't know how great Boogie Nights was, I think, until it was finished and actually...  Fired his agent.  Did he really?  Yeah, I was with his agent, too, and he fired him and he said, you put me in porn.  And then he got nominated.  Yeah.  And then...  Bring his agent back?  You put me in porn.  No, I think he went back and did an evening shade at Best Of.  So, you want to describe the heckler before we get into this?  Sure, yeah.  Just to give the overview. 
[01:38:00]  Heckler, the movie's all about, like, basically it deals with the world of heckling.  And it starts with stand-up, and then it goes into sports, touches on politics, and then  it kind of goes into the world of criticism, and then it kind of goes into the world of  blogging, and then the internet, and then just kind of how the world is, we live in  such a critical place, now everyone has an opinion, and it's kind of like, boom.  And now you have to see them.  Yeah.  And you have to be exposed to the criticism of people that really shouldn't be critics, 
[01:38:30]  you shouldn't mind.  Yeah.  It's just someone's opinion, but now it becomes this thing that's out there.  It's a documentary, but really it's a comedy.  But it's all about, you know, anybody has the power to say stuff now from anywhere.  And it's just like, heckling the comedy club used to be considered the worst, but it's not.  It's like the best of it now.  It's like the worst is the anonymous blogger sitting in his basement in Dubuque and saying 
[01:39:00]  the worst stuff.  So, that's kind of what it is.  And it's about me interviewing these people, seeing what makes them tick, talking to other  comedians, performers, actors.  Yeah, you confront some of your hecklers, and I think going into it, you're thinking,  I can handle this.  I'm going to sit these guys down and then see what they're all about.  And then by the end of it, you're wishing like stomach cancer on them and stuff.  Yeah.  And there was one scene, too, where he's with a heckler, and I just, I wanted to wring  this guy's neck.  Yeah.  Because you're talking to him about a joke about Christ or whatever, and he's like, 
[01:39:30]  well, you want to get into it or something?  Like that guy, you almost had a physical conversation with him.  Yes.  Did you, what happened?  He just told me.  I was doing a show in, like, West Virginia, in a college, and he said, you know, what's  that joke you did about Jesus, you know?  I did this joke called, like, you know, because priests are talking about the body of Christ  and they can get you to eat anything.  I'm like, they can just be like the nipple of Christ, and we would just suck on it because,  you know, it's through God, right?  And he's like, you can't say that.  That's against religion.  And I go, it's called the nipple of Christ, bro.  It's a joke.  He goes, you want to do something about this? 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  And then we ended up, like, getting in, like, a little tiff, and, like, my assistant was  there.  Amazing.  It was really good, man, because it covers the anger performers have at hecklers because  it's almost like, it's weird.  Like, when you're on stage, you kind of have to make a quick judgment as to what the guy's  intent is because most of them are douches, but there are people that have just had too  much to drink and are really just trying to be fun with you, but you know it's in the  eyes when somebody heckles you and you know that they're jealous and they're going to  rip you down.  And you know what they're doing, and sometimes you attack them too harshly, and the whole 
[01:40:30]  crowd, who doesn't do this every night, doesn't see their face, doesn't understand, I had  to crucify that guy.  Yeah.  He's garbage.  You don't get it.  And they turn on you.  And there's so many weird things with hecklers.  Yeah.  It's a fascinating thing because it's like, you, most of them want to help.  And, you know, Jim will tell you.  A lot of them are chicks.  We talk about that, how they get drunk.  And they want to help.  And it's just like if you're saying, like, you ever get belly button lint, and someone's  like, yeah, belly button lint.  And you're like, can I finish my thing? 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, finish it, dude.  And they just want to help.  So you don't really want to go after them.  But there are, it was one, and I didn't get it on camera.  It was in Canada, and I really can't talk about it because, you know, it's a lot of  graphic.  But it was a big Jamaican dude.  And he had this white girlfriend, and I was talking crap about Canada, and I like to just  give him a little stick and a puck, and they're happy for the rest of their lives.  And he's like, screw you, man, you don't know about Canada.  And I'm like, dude, you're from Jamaica.  Shut up.  And, like, he came after me physically, and then they had to stop him.  And it was amazing.  Like, this is the only time a guy actually physically wanted to get me. 
[01:41:30]  But really, we talk about in the movie about how heckling is not as bad as, like, blogging  and criticism, and how it's really about criticize the piece, not the person.  Yeah, I like how you have a lot of examples of comedians getting heckled.  And some guys could handle it because they got some stuff they got in their head, and  they're well-prepared for the heckler.  And then other guys just lose their mind like Guitar Dude.  Guitar Dude takes his guitar.  He's a legend, that guy.  And unfortunately, it's not on camera because it was just like it was a still shot of the 
[01:42:00]  stage, but he walked off camera to take his guitar and smash it over a heckler's head.  And then he puts the pick back in the thing.  Yeah.  He puts the pick back in the guitar.  And then he thought the whole crowd was going to appreciate what he just did, and they're  like, whoa, dude, what's up?  You know, because everyone was hating this heckler, but his reaction was such that the  whole crowd, like Jimmy was kind of saying, turned on the dude, and he's like, what, too  much?  And they're like, yeah, kind of.  And then all of a sudden, the guy said something like, all right, show over, and just walked  off stage.  Yeah.  That guy struck a blow for all. 
[01:42:30]  There's not a comedian alive that wouldn't pay that guy's rent for him.  Yeah.  He struck a blow for all of us, because you really learn, it's like sometimes they heckle  you, because they, like there was a woman in the documentary who was just, it's like  the literal heckler, where you say something, and they feel the need to correct you, because  these dummies understand that humor's an exaggeration unless it's relating to them.  So the really funny one with this British woman, he's talking about a British woman,  and she's like, we don't all talk like that in England, only the Queen does.  And he's like, well, did you bang everybody in England? 
[01:43:00]  He really smashed it.  Yeah, yeah.  And she had to laugh, because she knew she had, like, got, got, as they say.  But sometimes they just try to correct you on the facts.  They just, you just want to shut your mouth.  I thought what was brilliant, and we're going to try not to do the whole movie for you here,  Jamie, but there was a heckler in the front row in one of your shows.  Obviously, you thought about this heckle thing for a while, because you have a lot of footage  of hecklers going after you.  One guy in the front row is heckling you, and you're like, all right, hey, let's see what  you can do.  And you force the guy to go on stage.  And then Jamie is now in the front row with his legs up on the table, going, boo, and 
[01:43:30]  just, like, heckling the crap out of the guy.  And the guy literally wants to crap his pants.  He's, like, freaking out up there, because he really thought he could go up there and  maybe get a reaction on the crowd.  Oh, yeah.  I thought that was brilliant, too.  And even the critics that defended themselves and stuck by it and go, yeah, your movie was  terrible.  If a critic doesn't like a film, that's fine.  But just being face-to-face with these guys, they're all nerds. 
[01:44:00]  All of them are nerds.  The one guy with that little bump on the side of his stupid nose, where you were just, like  you say, talking about the sloppy, just say, oral treats.  He was so uncomfortable with you talking about sex like that.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That guy from the Tribune or wherever you are.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A little tool.  It's funny, you know, it's true.  It's like, I hate to categorize people, but he's right.  It's like, they are all nerds.  I needed to do this movie for my soul.  Like, I started doing my stand-up, right, and I was going to do a little special for 
[01:44:30]  Comedy Central, and they're like, go out on the road for six months and get your tight  45 or whatever you can do, right?  So I started doing it, and I started filming this stuff, and the heckling became the most  coolest part of the show.  So that's how the movie just started, and I started collecting, and I started talking to  guys like Joe and different people getting their heckles, and then it moved into, there  was blogging, because I started reading about my stuff.  I had a movie come out, and I just got destroyed, and that's how the movie kind of made itself.  Right.  And I now feel so good, but what Jim says is true. 
[01:45:00]  It's like, you have to learn who's saying this stuff, because you're reading about yourself,  and it's like, Jamie Kennedy not only sucks, he shouldn't have a career, his mother's  uterus should be shut down for giving birth to him.  You're like, whoa, what the hell?  What?  You know, it's like-  Bastards, yeah.  And you find out who's writing it, and then you feel better, but you have to go through  the process.  But there are some people that are haters, like that one guy at the end is a hater to  the end.  The guy with the beard?  Oh, yes.  The guy with the beard, who is the guy who is like-  And he says he's a comedian, too, which is weirder, because it's like- 
[01:45:30]  The guy who was kind of smiling at him?  Yeah, very snarky.  But he looked like a Nazi.  I'm sure he wasn't, but you know what I mean?  Oh, the guy-  Yeah, yeah.  You wanted to bite his face.  Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely.  Because it was this defiance that was this phony, it was an over-the-top defiance, like,  oh, you're going to call me out?  Well, I'll show you.  Yeah.  And you know that the guy isn't a funny guy.  He looks greasy.  Yeah.  You just know he's like a lonely nothing.  And he's probably not even that funny of a writer, which to me, most of them are not  good writers, which is the greatest crime they commit, is not being good writers. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  You know, you can criticize what you want, but be funny with it, and they're not.  Yeah.  And I just really wanted to knock his teeth out, because it wasn't- I don't mind a guy  standing his ground and going, you know what, I didn't like your movie.  Because you are calling them out, and some of them are going, look, there was one guy  who you call out, and you're like, why didn't you like it?  And he goes, it wasn't a good movie.  That was Richard Roper.  But you were very funny, because you're like, ugh.  Yeah.  He's like, all right.  Because they have points.  There's truth to it.  It's just that sometimes they rip you personally to the point.  Yeah, but what did I-  And what do you think that's about?  Because it's one thing for a critic to say, yeah, you know, I didn't like your performance 
[01:46:30]  in this movie, and they keep it professional.  But why do some of these people, like you said a little while ago, have to get so personal  where they wish cancer on you and death to your family?  We had a situation when we did our dumb Sex with Sam bit, which was horrific, but they  couldn't keep within what we did.  They had to bring our parents into it and wish that our parents were tarred and feathered  and thrown in the river.  I'm like, what do they have to do with us messing up on our radio show? 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  But where does that come from, where they crossed that line, you think?  It comes, well, if they're writers, it comes from, they're entertainers, too, basically.  They want to grab headlines.  So, you know, if they say, Jim Norton's show is like watching herpes manifest on your  nutsack, whatever, it's like, oh, someone's going to read that.  You know what I mean?  Or Jamie Kennedy's career is worse than, you know, whatever.  So, that's number one.  Number two is, I mean, that's really what I've noticed.  Some of them are, if someone really rips me in a funny, creative way, I give them props. 
[01:47:30]  I mean, there are times on the tape I don't do good with hecklers.  There are times I do.  I mean, sometimes they win.  You got to love them.  Right, right.  But I think sometimes it's really about, Patton Oswalt says it really good.  He says, there used to be a time where you'd look at people and you'd be like, oh, Gale  Sears can run good or blah.  Now, it's like, just makes people angry.  It's like this generation of, why is Jim Norton and Opie have a radio show?  Why not me?  You know what I mean?  It's a different time.  It seems like it's that mentality of everybody's giving everybody such positive feedback. 
[01:48:00]  They think they deserve it.  Patton was right about that, too.  It's like there's people who just think they should be doing it and there's a jealousy  and you kind of know, as a performer, your instinct, you understand when someone's heckling  you immediately why they're doing it.  Right.  Like one time I was on stage at the Comedy Cellar and there's a guy to my right and I  was doing a clean set.  I was working on a Leno set.  It was a little aggressive.  And he's like, ah, that's something I said that wasn't gentlemanly.  And he was trying to be this knight in shining armor for his stupid family. 
[01:48:30]  And I laid it to him.  It wasn't funny.  You would have thought I never did comedy in my life.  I was a dock worker.  I was like Lee J. Cobb just yelling at this slob.  And I'm like, don't use me to impress your effing wife and your effing family.  Because I knew exactly what he was doing.  He was trying to show off for his family and try to shut this punk down.  And sometimes that's what you have to do.  You've got to throw the set to walk out with your dignity.  Because you're not going to allow that guy to ruin you.  You can't do it.  Now, wait, were you able to recover? 
[01:49:00]  Or was that it?  Did you have to end that?  Nah, I don't think so.  I think the rest of the set went poorly.  Who cared?  I made 25 bucks at the cellar.  It had to happen.  It had to happen.  In Heckler, Jamie Kennedy also gets to interview George Lucas.  And we called him out on it as soon as he sat down.  Like, dude, you did not set up an interview with George Lucas.  You railroaded the guy.  You knew he was going to be somewhere.  You went with a film crew and said, hey, George.  And there's people around.  So now George doesn't want to be the a-hole.  So he's like, all right, I'll give you 30 seconds on heckling. 
[01:49:30]  Wait, you know, it's so funny because everyone's like, dude, how'd you get George Lucas?  Of course, you bust me one second.  Wait, so you want to hear the real story?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I tell people that I was up for, I was like Jar Jar Banks.  I say, well, I was Jar Jar, but I couldn't do it.  He owed me a favor.  So I was doing a video.  I did a comedy video with Bob Saget called Roland with Saget.  Sure.  It was like a rap fun rap.  Yeah, and it did very well.  It did well.  So we're doing this video, right?  And I'm filming on Hollywood Boulevard.  And this Hollywood Boulevard that day was crazy. 
[01:50:00]  It was a commercial.  It was me filming something.  And there was CSI New York, right?  So we're doing this video.  All these girls and stuff.  And I'm sitting there.  And somebody goes, why is Michael McDonald on set?  And I'm like, Michael McDonald?  What?  And I look over.  And I go, that's not Michael McDonald.  That's George Lucas.  Oh, my God.  He looks like Michael McDonald, right?  So I go over.  And I go, George?  He goes, hey, how are you doing?  I go, what are you doing?  He goes, I'm just here.  I'm looking at your cameras. 
[01:50:30]  So George Lucas, every day, goes, every Wednesday, his daughter goes to USC.  He goes and has, I shouldn't tell stalkers this.  He goes and has lunch at Mousseau and Franks.  You know Mousseau and Franks on Hollywood Boulevard?  It's old-time Italian food.  He just goes and has a little bolognese and leaves, right?  So he walks to Hollywood Boulevard, and he's a big camera into cameras.  So we were using this high-tech new camera called a RED camera.  And he was like, what kind of BPM do you have?  What's your shutter speed?  And he'll just walk, right?  So he starts talking to the camera guy. 
[01:51:00]  And I know George.  He was like, you know, I was like any other guy.  We had a lot of girls.  I go, hey, George, what are you doing?  And he goes, I'm just checking out the cameras.  And I go, will you be in this video?  And he goes, what?  So I had, like, we're shooting the video.  So I actually put him in the video.  I put two girls next to him.  And he lip-synced.  And then as we were there, we were filming for Heckler.  And I go, George, let me ask you a couple things about criticism.  And I got him.  And he was amazing.  But the thing is, is that he thought he was on the set of CSI New York.  He goes, is this CSI New York?  Oh, no. 
[01:51:30]  And then we're like, no, it's our video.  It was what?  And he goes, you're my video, bitch.  And Saga comes over.  He's like, was Darth Vader gay?  He starts just asking the worst questions about Star Wars.  He's like, Yoda, was he a Jew?  Come on.  What's this?  It was hilarious.  And George was awesome.  Very comedy.  What we did kind of ambush him.  And he was great.  So check it out.  So we signed off.  We had three quotes of him.  And he said, two days ago, you can use that one.  And we used the one.  And it was really cool. 
[01:52:00]  And he let us put a link to StarWars.com.  You also got, I like the fact that you went into the internet blogging.  Because it's funny, too.  And I've noticed this about myself.  We as performers are also, we are one-sided.  And all of us are guilty of this.  I've never heard a performer who got a good review go, what the hell does that guy know?  Why is he a critic?  Right, right.  Like, it's only when we get trashed.  Sure.  And I've been trashed.  I've never once, like, when somebody writes good things about me on a message board,  I'm like, oh, that's nice.  But when they write bad things about me, I'm like, oh, those cowards. 
[01:52:30]  You know, I just, I always look at the negative.  Over and over again, you understand that most performers, you know, the whole audience could  love you except for one person.  And that's one person that's going to bother you for the rest of the night.  Isn't that brutal?  Why is that?  Isn't that brutal?  And a fan site could do the same thing, 90% positive stuff.  But one lousy dude could ruin your day.  You know, and the cure to that is to just stop reading all that stuff.  Yeah.  I mean, you look at it and you're like, you have to learn. 
[01:53:00]  I think this was a real cathartic process for me.  And you have to learn about who's writing it and why.  But when you're reading it and they're writing like, you know, not only do you suck, but  it's like you shouldn't have a career.  You're ugly.  You're this.  You're like, whoa.  And if you, you do read it and you start going, oh my God, like you, people don't think  it affects them.  But I, you know, Robert De Niro, there's a lot of cool people that I did, weren't in  this movie that I tried to get. 
[01:53:30]  And, um, Phil Jackson told me an amazing story and he's like, I'll never be in your  movie, but I love that you're doing it.  I go, why?  He goes, cause you're giving them power.  And he's like, and he told me an amazing story of how this one guy would bring the  hottest girls is a famous basketball heckler to the game, to the opposing bench.  And he would, the girls would say real personal stuff about the guy cause they would know stuff  and they would freak the guy out.  And so like, there's that.  And there's like Robert De Niro.  I know I've seen an interview says, I don't read my reviews. 
[01:54:00]  I can't, he doesn't want to know what people are saying.  And that's Robert De Niro.  You know what I mean?  So it's a fascinating world.  I don't think you are empowering them though.  I really don't because everyone knows they exist.  Yeah.  I mean, they're in the USA today.  They're in every major newspaper.  So I don't think all of a sudden you're taking these obscure figures.  They are empowered to a certain degree.  And I like the fact that you're, it's like cockroaches.  You're shining a light on them.  Um, yeah, I like, uh, and look, they, what's his name?  Hey, is it Uwe or Uwe?  Uwe.  Uwe.  Uwe Boll.  He's coming on.  Yeah, we can't wait to talk to this guy. 
[01:54:30]  He's the man.  He's, he's a German director.  Have you ever had him before?  No.  Uwe.  He, he seems like he, like he's nuts.  No, Uwe is an intense dude.  He's German.  He works out.  And he, he, he fights people all the time.  He has a petition right now.  He says, if you want me to direct him anymore, I'd sign a thousand signatures.  Well, so for, for, for your movie, he, he, he fights critics.  Yeah.  He has.  That was like the most amazing part of the movie, by the way, that they would, these critics  would actually, cause they all want their attention.  So of course they're going to agree to it. 
[01:55:00]  Well, that, I could be in a movie about, uh, you know, hecklers.  Did they know they were going to be in the movie or no?  Well, it has a couple of things.  It's like, number one is, is to your point is, is that now how everyone, like what you're  saying is, my whole thing is if someone has a paper and it's, you know, the East Texas  Christian Daly and it's 70,000 circulation and he writes, you know, Jamie Kennedy's movie  sucks, whatever.  My whole thing is, you, if you know something about my movie before you trash it, know what  you're talking about.  Because if not, there's 70,000 people just, I lost number one on the business. 
[01:55:30]  Number two is all those guys, they agreed to fight him.  And I mean, he's a tough dude.  They definitely, it's like a reality show contestant.  Like when I did my old show, Jamie Kennedy experiment, and we put people through crazy  stuff and they'd still sign because they want to be on TV.  We all want to be famous.  Yeah.  So they did sign and, uh, he ended up fighting for five guys and beating them all.  It's in a row, right?  Yeah.  Five in a row.  It's an amazing scene because you, you see the critic and what he said about this guy's,  uh, you know, uh, uh, film or his work, whatever. 
[01:56:00]  And then the next scene is this guy in the ring getting his ass handed.  And it was so well, one after another, I was, that was an amazing, amazing part of the  movie.  They would show the guy talk.  The guy would say like, they, they showed them all tough to like the, you know, the  nerd behind his keyboard, like, ah, you know, whatever, whatever it would be.  That one goth guy.  Right.  And then they show the guy, he got beat up so bad.  He's on all fours puking.  That was the great.  Oh my God.  That's how Zapruder must've felt when he shot the assassin to see that guy vomiting. 
[01:56:30]  That's the critic who was punched in the stomach, vomiting.  Yeah.  All cocky behind his keyboard.  And you know, next scene he's in the ring with this animal.  He's getting his ass handed to him.  Yeah.  They had no idea.  I mean, it was cool that they showed up, but they got beat.  And as a side note, I tried to add, I met Billy Burr and I tried to use that footage.  All right.  Cause that's coming in like crazy.  You know about that.  I'm sure.  But the footage doesn't, it doesn't, it's so hard to, uh, it doesn't look.  Cause puddle of AIDS and it's the rest. 
[01:57:00]  Of course, Bill Burr taking on 10,000 hecklers.  I saw Bill at the comedy store and he's like, you should use it.  And I'm like, okay.  And I tried to use this footage and it doesn't look, it's very hard to see.  It's barely usable.  Yeah.  But it's an amazing story.  And I was like, someone that actually shot it.  Yeah.  It was like shot on a cell phone.  Yeah.  That thing.  But I'm being from Philly.  Everything he said is true.  And it was brilliant.  And it's true.  It's like the more you crap on them, the more they, that thing is getting more and more  popular.  That was amazing.  Yeah.  Go on. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  It was amazing.  Him just, uh, he got heckled by a couple of guys.  He said, that's it.  And he just took on the entire crowd.  They are trading that video all over the place.  I think every comedian in the world has seen that now.  Yeah.  He just said, screw it.  Yeah.  I'm going after these, these animals and he ripped them apart.  And they love him for it.  Yeah.  He's not even a real person.  Yeah.  He's got a statue of Rocky.  And then he mentioned all the black people they don't have statues of that were legitimate  boxers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was great.  Oh, he ran through everything.  I was amazed he knew so much about Philly. 
[01:58:00]  I know.  He pounded them.  And he counted down the same time, like 11 times, two minutes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Five minutes left.  Billy, he was just great.  It was great to see a comedian do that.  Well, I hope we did your movie justice.  You guys are amazing.  Thank you.  Jimmy and I really, really liked it.  It was very, very interesting.  Extremely interesting.  It's going to be, what, coming out on DVD?  It comes out September 9th on DVD.  Okay.  So I don't want to know that.  But we're hopefully going to do like a little midsummer, like, you know, LA, New York thing.  That'd be cool.  Let us know.  We'll go there.  We'll check it out.  I'd love it. 
[01:58:30]  I'd love to do that.  I'd love to do that.  You can pre-order it on Amazon.com, too.  The Heckler.  And then tonight, it's live at Times Square Arts Center.  Two shows tonight, two shows tomorrow.  Jamie Kennedy.  Tickets 212-586-7829, right?  Yeah, it's 42nd and 8th Avenue.  I mean, it's right in the middle of Times Square.  It's cool.  You can't not get there from a subway.  It's the easiest place in New York to get there.  It's an old peep show or something.  It used to be Show World.  Yeah.  It still is in certain parts.  Show World.  Yeah.  It's great.  Above is the Comedy Club.  Yeah.  And downstairs, you can go and just finish.  After, yeah, you can come see me and then get a happy ending after. 
[01:59:00]  It rules.  Or get the happy ending ahead of time so you're nice and happy and relaxed.  Relax, yeah.  So you don't heckle.  So you don't heckle.  Yeah, you know what?  I bet you everyone that goes into a booth before and comes up is just going to laugh and laugh.  Oh, even if they didn't like it.  Well, it wasn't for me.  No one would be angry.  No, not at all.  Relax.  Thank you, Jamie.  Good luck.  Thanks, you guys.  Thank you so much.  All right, we've got to take a break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony on your radio dial.  Radio dial. 
[01:59:30]  I always feel bad when I don't see the movie.  You guys saw it.  That was good.  I didn't see the movie.  That movie was handed out days ago by a friend.  I got it yesterday.  I brought it home.  I didn't watch it.  It's pretty much the chain of events.  The way this works is...  You didn't have to watch the movie, though.  That was very relatable on so many levels because we all deal with idiots behind their 
[02:00:00]  keyboards.  Well, that's all I could bring up to him was the internet thing.  And then I was like, I don't want to get too involved in it because then he'll realize  that I didn't see the movie.  It's so embarrassing.  It's usually...  The way this works is this.  Normally, at least one of us is prepared.  Yes.  Rarely two of us are prepared.  Never are all three of us prepared.  Never three.  No.  And occasionally, none of us are prepared. 
[02:00:30]  This is true.  When none of us have seen the movie.  So, shot on a camera.  I liked it.  So, yeah, that's the whole thing.  So, tell us what your movie's about.  George Lucas thing was good.  It was great.  And he was good with the hecklers, too.  I mean, he really hammered them.  He had some really funny lines.  He got some stock footage, man.  He's got Ronald Reagan going after a heckler.  And I think Barbra Streisand from...  Reagan was good.  ...a Madison Square Garden show where she's telling someone to shut the F up. 
[02:01:00]  Like, really getting into some potty mouth material there.  Reagan depressed me because it reminded me of how refreshing it is to see somebody behave  honestly in political life.  Like, just as a man who's annoyed, Reagan was giving a speech and someone kept heckling  and heckling.  And he goes, oh, shut up.  The place went ballistic.  They loved it.  That's all one of these candidates has to do.  And they're going to be the next president of the United States.  Just stop. 
[02:01:30]  An honest moment.  Stop being so calculated and just be yourself.  McCain has...  I don't understand that.  Hillary...  McCain is the closest, without a doubt.  And Hillary is nowhere near.  And Obama is, like, still scared that he's the first black candidate that has a real shot.  He's scared of that?  I mean, he's not the first black candidate, obviously, but the first one that has a real  shot.  So he's being uber protective, too.  Just be a real dude, man.  And you got it.  We're all looking for that now.  Hillary gets heckled and then she just throws her caps up on the podium and asks anybody 
[02:02:00]  if they want shawarma.  Yeah.  Fat-legged idiot.  Get it, folks.  I had to explain it.  Stop looking at the polls.  Stop doing your freaking market research and look at the demographics.  And just go up there and be you.  And your dopey speak.  Your political speak.  Back, back, back, back.  Right.  Be honest for a second.  That was the greatest moment when Reagan told that guy to shut up.  Yeah.  Reagan was great at speeches and wasn't even...  Obviously, people were writing his speeches, but he was great at improv-ing lines when people 
[02:02:30]  would say stuff to him.  He could just blurt stuff out.  My favorite was, the bombing starts in five minutes.  Did he say that?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, he was checking the mics.  As a joke.  Yeah.  As a joke, he goes, yeah, they're talking about the Soviet Union.  Say, well, the bombing starts in five minutes.  Yeah, we'll get that.  That was taken...  We'll find that first.  That wasn't taken very well by the Soviet Union.  No, of course not.  Danny, one of the DJs here in New York City after we get off the air.  It's Nick Carter. 
[02:03:00]  When is she on?  I think...  I want to say afternoons.  Am I wrong?  No, Ian's...  12 to 3?  Oh, that's right, Ian.  He's great.  Ian.  Oh, so it's Nick, and then it's Danny right after...  I really don't know, and I apologize.  Yeah.  Now I'm going to check out Danny later today.  He's sexy, man.  Here in New York City.  Oh, bug me.  So you came in for the Rob Halford interview with Ian, the afternoon drive guy.  And you and E-Rock were here.  You were talking to Danny.  You think she's kind of attractive and stuff.  Very attractive.  There's a little something going on.  Very innocent.  A little flirting and stuff.  Not from me.  She wasn't flirting back.  Who knows?  We'll have to get her side of the story. 
[02:03:30]  She's being professional.  And you realized on the way home that you smelled really bad.  You were on a subway?  Yeah, I take the train.  You never take the train.  What was that about?  Joe Commuter?  You're kind of scared of the subways.  You rarely go on the subway.  No, I zip all over.  I zip all over, Ope.  And you took the subway from here?  Yeah, why do you think my nickname is Underground Jimmy?  That's weird, is it?  Yeah, I just made that up from now on.  I won't answer to anything but.  Yeah, up into what you were earlier.  What was I earlier?  I forgot.  I can't see you fill of lies.  And then you're on the subway and you're smelling this horrendous odor. 
[02:04:00]  You think it's the guy next to you.  You realize it's you.  And you're like, oh my God, I was talking to a pretty girl only a half hour ago.  She must have smelled my body odor.  And then she walked out.  When she left, she goes, oh, it's cold in here.  And it wasn't.  Here's what happened.  I stunk.  She smelled it.  She left.  She needed that.  She had to hit the bricks.  Well, she mentioned the incident on her fine radio show.  And we got the audio.  The Rock of New York, 92.3K Rock.  I was telling you earlier that Judas Priest were up here yesterday.  So many of us were in the studio. 
[02:04:30]  We were so excited.  Everyone was just staring at Rob Halford.  I mean, Judas Priest were here.  Jim Norton and E-Rock from Opie and Anthony came up.  I was hanging out with those guys.  I guess this morning on Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton was saying how he was embarrassed  because he got home after me and him were hanging out.  And he realized that he smelled.  Forgot the deodorant, maybe.  I don't know.  I totally smelled it.  But I assumed it was E-Rock.  He's the dirty one, right?  I'm so happy.  Hey, Anthony, this morning, check out the show rundown at 92.3K Rock.com.  While you're there, of course, check out the pictures of Priest. 
[02:05:00]  Hey, man, she does a good job.  She's great.  And her voice matches her body.  Yeah, matches the looks.  Absolutely.  There's a photo of Rob Halford in the foreground.  And in the background, you see E-Rock casually sitting up on the table.  Yeah.  You know, just not a care in the world.  And her head is totally turned away from E-Rock.  And that's probably because she thinks he smells really bad.  And, Jim, you are so flirting with your body right there.  I know a little bit about body language.  Look at you, all casual, hands in your pocket,  leaning up against the wall with your head tilted. 
[02:05:30]  Like, oh, really?  Looking all endearing to her.  You want to look all innocent.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, they're staring at her toes.  They were sexy.  You're making believe you're listening to what she's saying.  But I know what's going on in your brain.  You're like, I wonder what she would look like naked.  And her feet.  I was looking at her feet.  I've been looking at her feet lately.  I don't know why I'm not a foot guy.  See?  That's what I say.  I always said I'm not a foot guy, but it's part of the whole package.  Because you like mommy's cleavage when you were growing up.  No, I don't like mommy's cleavage.  Huh?  Not at all. 
[02:06:00]  I watch my sister breastfeed.  That's one of the things they say.  The guys with the feet, they're crawling around on the floor,  and it looks like cleavage when they're down that low.  Really?  Mini cleavage, yeah.  Mommy never had toenails on her breasts.  That would be disgusting.  They don't smell the same.  They say it's kind of the toes where, you know, it looks like cleavage down there.  Really?  That's one of the theories.  No, because I like a good arch and a good ankle and a good heel.  Do you know what a dominatrix told me about feet?  We were talking.  What?  Oh, you scared me. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Don't get scared.  Oh, boy.  You scared me.  This is very rare, but I'm writing it on my hand.  I got a new one.  Oh, boy.  What?  Look at that.  What?  Just writes, what?  We were talking, and I was on my feet, and I said, the mommy thing, and she goes, yeah,  but also teachers.  She's like, because when you're sitting there, you look under the desk, and a lot of times  their shoes come off, and I'm like, you're absolutely right, and she goes, a big one  a lot of clients like is when she hangs just half the shoe hanging off, like she's being 
[02:07:00]  casual, and her shoe is dangling off her foot like a teacher would.  Really?  Yeah, she had a lot of guys like that.  It reminds me of their teacher.  I just don't get that one.  It's not a fetish of any sort.  It's just part of the package.  I like, because it leads into a lovely leg, but it's part of the whole thing.  It's got to look good.  It's got to have a good arch.  It's got to be proportioned to the girl.  Yeah.  You can't have any gnarly toes or anything.  You know?  It's just going to look nice. 
[02:07:30]  I got the, probably the story of the day.  What?  No, don't steal my bitch.  Oh, Jimmy, that's a funny bitch.  Thanks.  Jimmy, don't do that.  Don't do that to me.  What?  Let's steal a bitch, Jim.  Look, I wrote it in everything.  This is my bitch.  I'm going to be doing it until the listeners start bitching about that one on the website.  In five minutes?  Well, it looks like the one-trick pony has a new trick.  Shut up. 
[02:08:00]  Shut up, you nerd.  You nerd.  You're a nerd.  You nerd.  Jamie Kennedy says so.  You're a nerd.  Bunch of nerds.  Yeah, we're a nerd.  Like a happy, no, angry type of guy.  Nerd.  More surprises coming next week.  A sadistic gang of police impersonators abducted and tortured scores of East Coast cocaine traffickers. 
[02:08:30]  Really?  Yes, really.  And how was that did?  Oh, I don't know.  I didn't get the rest of the story.  Oh, okay.  How'd they torture him?  Sounds terrible.  What happened?  No, I'm not Amish.  People are asking if I'm Amish.  Why?  Because we were talking about the Amish yesterday.  You love electricity.  Yes, I do.  A sadistic gang of police impersonators abducted and tortured scores of East Coast cocaine traffickers. 
[02:09:00]  Got to play the blank game here, ladies and gentlemen.  Forcing them to hand over multi-million dollar stashes by threatening to squeeze their blanks.  Squeeze their assets.  Oh, that's a good one.  By threatening to squeeze their blanks with pliers.  Oh, okay.  Screws on a local park bench.  Oh, I don't think that's going to match. 
[02:09:30]  Eyelashes.  Squeezed it with a, yeah, I'm going to say, let's see.  Squeeze their blanks.  This is so hard.  Toothpaste tubes.  Yeah.  Maybe.  No?  No.  Oh, damn. 
[02:10:00]  Improv skills, which none of us have.  It's amazing how we're all looking for something that is kind of squeezed at times.  Yes.  And could work both ways.  Well.  Swing and a miss, swing and a miss, swing and a miss.  I think we know.  Because it's plural.  It's the old Pulp Fiction thing, isn't it?  Pair of pliers and a blowtorch.  Well, you know.  We all know what it is.  Yes.  It's the most sensitive of areas on a gentleman.  Oh, yeah.  And there's more than one. 
[02:10:30]  Let's just put it that way.  Yes.  So, threatening to squeeze their blanks with pliers.  An indictment unsealed in federal court in Brooklyn charged eight men with robbery, conspiracy, drug dealing, and an array of other crimes.  Since the spring of 2003, the gang injured about 100 people while committing 100 holdups targeting large-scale traffickers in New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Florida.  The take, more than 1,600 pounds of coke worth $20 million.  Wow.  And $4 million in cash. 
[02:11:00]  All eight of the suspects arrested were from the Dominican Republic and faced up to 40 years to life in prison if convicted.  Taking the pliers to the old junk.  That is something that if I was in the military or anything and they wanted information from me, that would be spill the beans right there.  If I saw the pliers and the second I figured out what they were going to do with them, I would blurt out every single military secret I knew. 
[02:11:30]  I'd repatriate myself to the country that I'm invading.  I would denounce the Lord, my country, my family.  How do you take that kind of pain?  Well, let's see if, would Pat Duffy do it?  He'll do anything.  No, I think.  Get the pliers.  No, I think we found one he wouldn't do.  What?  Pliers to the, you know what?  Yeah.  We have pliers?  Tim, we have pliers?  We got a minute left in the show.  See how tight you can actually do it. 
[02:12:00]  And let's have Sam do it.  No?  Bad idea?  All of a sudden you're, errrr.  Ow.  Ow.  He punched my afro off.  How good would it be to see Sam walking bald and just holding an afro wig?  There's an afro on the floor.  He's got three little hairs.  Just rolling around like a football helmet without a face mask.  It's all fake.  Anthony will love the video, girl with Tourette's, screams the N-bomb constantly. 
[02:12:30]  YouTube search, hilarious racist girl with Tourette's syndrome.  Hilarious racist girl with Tourette's syndrome.  Okay.  Can we get that on the air before we get out of here or is that going to have to wait?  Does she have Tourette's or is it really, can we get that on the air, but how?  Yeah, can we get that on the air?  Period.  What?  What?  What?  That's an unpopular word.  And now your weather for Haiti.  Very much everywhere.  It's going to be hot.  Is that it?  And I don't need a jacket.  Thanks, Arthur. 
[02:13:00]  Arthur's a real hoot.  Stoned.  There's no reason.  Arthur, for some reason, just always laughs at jacket jokes.  It's going to be 80.  I guess I won't need a jacket.  Arthur laughs every time that that's mentioned.  I don't know why he does.  Like somebody will say, Stanley Kubrick's or I love the full metal jacket. 
[02:13:30]  What kind of bee is that?  I believe it's a yellow jacket.  What are you going to do when you go home?  Danny, what do you got, buddy?  Tourette's video I pulled for you like so long ago.  It was from this HBO.  Oh, well, excuse me.  I'm just saying you did it already.  I don't remember.  All right.  It was a while ago.  Well, let's pull it again.  Let's give it another play.  I don't want to drive my nice car through that neighborhood. 
[02:14:00]  Why?  Take my car jacket.  Oh, car jacket.  See?  He likes jacket jokes.  Yeah.  That's right, folks.  Just getting warmed up.  I dare you to come up with one more.  I'm trying so bad.  I know you are.  That's why I'm putting it on this.  Well, if you go through the neighborhood and your car gets a flat, what are you going to  have to do to change the tire?  Triple A.  Wait, did I get that wrong?  Give it to his face.  Triple A.  Ralph Cramden. 
[02:14:30]  Son of a bitch.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.  I hated that he got that one.  I love it.  So quick.  Thanks a lot, Jimmy.  But Opie, I was just helping.  We were doing jacket jokes.  Opie, I was helping.  Thanks a lot.  Sorry.  What is everyone doing this weekend?  Ooh.  Jimmy?  Hopefully sit-ups.  Anthony?  I don't know.  I got a couple of things on the burner. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  On the burner.  But I will be seeing my lovely mommy on Sunday for Mommy's Day.  Oh, yeah.  Mother's Day.  Happy Mother's Day to everybody.  Yeah, mine too.  I'll probably go out a little shooting.  Are you going to see your mom for Mother's Day, Jimmy?  No.  Why?  I'm not driving into traffic.  I love my mother.  But I'll email her.  Oh, that's nice.  You'll email her?  Yeah.  That's not nice.  That's very nice.  An e-card.  That's not nice.  She had to push you out of her body, and you don't want to be stuck in traffic to see  her on Mother's Day.  Good work, Mom. 
[02:15:30]  Vice grips?  What are you, insane?  Oh, really?  Needlenose vice grips on the, you know, area.  The old bag of roof.  Yeah, that'll hurt.  All right.  We can...  Oh, wow, that hurts.  Do you really think someone would do this with the pliers?  Why would anyone do that?  I want to be a dentist.  What?  Independent.  Oh, boy.  Now he has to do it.  He's doing the voice.  That's the guy.  Do the voice. 
[02:16:00]  It's the guy.  I don't want to do the voice.  Maybe he should do the voice.  See, it's him.  It's the guy.  He's right there.  They're the pliers.  That's a great line to end the week of radio.  So, you know, any time now.  Go.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's M202.  In the world of radio shock, Josh, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office. 
[02:16:30]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:17:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shot shots, Opie and Anthony.  killed Hey!  Oh, it's brown.  Oh, it's brown.  Smell, smell.  Oh, yeah!  This is where entertainment is going.  She's been stabbed once and shot twice.  No, I've been stabbed twice.  Shot twice.  Who's the common denominator in all these problems?  Oh, Anthony.  You have to lick a swath of the icing off 
[02:17:30]  so that bag shows through where icing was.  It's time for people to understand  these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hi, everybody on the bleachers.  Hi.  There they are.  I've got a lot of bleacher people.  I say we call them bleacher creatures.  Well, that would be outrageous.  Oh, hey. 
[02:18:00]  I see Patty's there, too.  Well, we've got a full look at her in shame.  Why are you putting your head in your hands?  Like, that's a bad thing to say Patty is here?  I should lay her head on her back like a...  Well, forget it.  Like what?  I was going to do a beheading joke.  All right.  You know, how they lay the head on the back.  But then I just lost all confidence.  As you should have.  I punched out.  As you should have. 
[02:18:30]  Exactly.  There we go.  The bleachers are full.  That means they're coming in here today  to get very up close and personal  with the Opie and Anthony show.  But we can't do it right now  because there's been a lot of chatter  in between shows.  We're going to go live with Don Imus.  He's doing his radiothon  or whatever the hell he calls it.  And we figure it wouldn't be smart  to have live microphones  in front of our listeners  as we talk to Mr. Imus.  Because one word could pretty much  destroy his career and our career. 
[02:19:00]  So after the Imus little quick little  who gives a crap segment we do with him,  we're going to bring you guys in  to check out the show very, very close.  He's been begging.  Yeah.  Begging.  Yeah, this Imus, you know,  he's got to go away and do his own thing.  Stop writing our content.  Enough.  Enough.  We got it.  You're back.  You've been back.  Great.  You have a hat on, crew.  Right.  It's been a year already?  Yeah.  No, he has not been back for a year.  No, a year or so.  A year since he was fired.  Oh, okay.  All right, good.  Yeah, it's a little over a year 
[02:19:30]  and then, what, he took six, seven months off?  I love when I adamantly correct someone  who said the opposite.  No, he hasn't been back for a year.  No.  My apologies.  Not accepted.  Hey, this is pretty cool, Jimmy.  You got a little exposure on a plane.  Dave in Atlanta, what's up?  You're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Good, man.  Hey, Jimmy, I was on a flight yesterday  from Boston back to Atlanta  and I guess HBO had done an interview of you  and they were playing it on the plane.  Wow, an interview with me,  that must have been quite a while ago  for Lucky Louie. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, really?  No, it was about the Monster Rain.  They had questions,  but they were posted on the screen  versus, you know, someone reading them.  Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah,  I did do that for Monster.  What was the, uh, what airline?  Uh, Delta.  Thank you.  Oh, a little Delta Airbill.  Delta, look at you, Jimmy.  Jim Norton on the Delta Connection.  Very nice.  Thank you, sir.  You're going places.  Explain the seatbelt.  I'm teasing, Jimmy.  Wait, explain this.  I see when the stewardess comes out  and explains buckling the seatbelt. 
[02:20:30]  He said, rather watch that  than you being interviewed, but...  No, that was actually...  I just didn't hear it.  That was funny.  I wasn't...  Go on, hurt me.  I'm an easy target.  Hey, um, yesterday,  we were watching a Borat interview.  He was, like, being interviewed  by some broad somewhere in the world.  This wasn't in the movie, obviously,  and it was just...  I don't know. 
[02:21:00]  I guess we need to set up  why we're playing this.  We just happened to come upon this yesterday  as we're just show-prepping  our asses off in the office,  and he had the greatest description  for Bryce ever.  Well, yeah.  Definitely very Borat.  But first, they took a couple highlights  from this interview  that are worth playing.  Borat talks about his mom.  In time for Mother's Day,  there's the tie.  Yeah.  People on the street,  they say,  oh, motherfuckers, motherfuckers.  You've hung out with them.  You know what it's like.  Why do they want to fuck my mother?  Oh.  Yeah, she is very tiny 
[02:21:30]  and have a...  We say to make a sexy time  with my mother  is like to throw a sausage  down a main avenue in Kazakhstan.  Oh, you poor mother.  Not tight like a man's under.  We got to interrupt  to talk to Mr. Imus?  You guys ready?  Yeah, we're ready.  No cursing, my brother.  Oh, no.  No cursing.  Come on home, boys.  Opie and Anthony.  Good morning, guys.  Good morning, Mr. Imus.  How are you?  I'm fine. 
[02:22:00]  How are you guys?  Very good.  Very good.  We're working on our radio voices  this morning.  How are you?  I'm fine listening.  Now, by the way,  thank you for making fun of me  all these years.  It's really a highlight of my...  Every time I listen to you guys,  I hear you're making me feel bad.  And I'm...  As you know, I could be...  I probably am Opie's dad.  That's one.  You're too ugly to be my dad.  So, here's...  First of all,  on a serious note,  thank you both very much  for what you did last year 
[02:22:30]  and for supporting me,  and I appreciate that.  And if there's ever anything  that either one of you need,  please don't call me.  People, maybe.  Yeah, exactly.  Not even them.  Well, we took over your  Radiothon last year  when they kicked you out the door.  Yes, and I appreciate that.  Listen, my wife is here,  and Charles and I,  we've been trying to get her  to take her top off,  but we...  She said it's like  going to the old folks' home  and taking your clothes off  for your grandfather. 
[02:23:00]  Well, that must be  a hit in the bedroom.  I just wonder how you guys do it,  you know?  Damn, Don.  You got a beautiful wife,  and you mean to tell me  you can't even get her top off?  Well, not on the radio, no.  Damn.  You know what?  You got to, like,  break out some dollar bills there,  my friend.  I think he's done that.  Because we're getting...  At least he's with her.  Hey, come on, Don. 
[02:23:30]  I'm in the same boat.  Jesus Christ.  Think girls are swarming over me  for my good looks?  Yeah, I hear you.  You know, Don,  I have to curse you, by the way.  Every old lady I run into,  oh, that Don Imus  talks so nicely about you.  Nicely?  It's like,  it's old bank tellers,  it's just...  Old broads love me  because of your radio show.  Well, thank you very much. 
[02:24:00]  I guess that was a compliment.  I don't know.  My mom appreciates it, anyway.  Listen, I'll take it.  Yeah.  Anyway, thank you both very much.  I actually do appreciate it.  Hey, we're killing here.  Why are you cutting us off already?  What's wrong with you?  Because I have a lot of helm here.  What, you got to do,  traffic and weather?  I'll leave on helm.  Great leave on helm.  Damn.  How are things going  with the Radiothon?  We're at $1,157,004.  Damn, nice.  That's good, right?  Well, we thought we didn't, 
[02:24:30]  you know, in this economy  and the fact that it's only  on my program on ABC,  why, you know.  Right.  We're happy we did this one.  Well, can we give out  the numbers, too?  Yeah, how can people  contribute?  They can call 1-877-877-6464  or go to wabcradio.com  is for the Tomorrow's Children's Fund,  which is an organization of parents  whose kids have cancer  and they raise millions of dollars  to provide everything  from social and emotional support  to primarily financial support. 
[02:25:00]  And there's nobody in this country  that doesn't know somebody  who has cancer.  Cancer is still the leading cause  of death by disease  in this country.  And also for the CJ Foundation  for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.  And while they've reduced  the incidence of death  to SIDS by about half,  still 4,000 to 5,000 kids a year  die from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.  It's a national organization  and there's nobody  who doesn't know somebody  who's lost a child to SIDS  in the I Miss Cattle Ranch  for Kids with Cancer, 
[02:25:30]  which we run by the Ribera  in New Mexico.  And we've taken  a little over 800 kids.  And it's a hardcore program  in which it's not  the camp happy phase.  We're not sitting around  the campfire singing Kumbaya,  but we take these kids out  and we explain to them  that nobody goes  through life undefeated  and don't allow themselves  to be defined  by their disease,  that they can do anything  any other kid can do.  And we take kids  from all over the world.  So those are the three organizations  we're raising money for, 
[02:26:00]  877-877-6464-RWABCradio.com.  Hey, Don, it's a great cause.  I don't know if a lot of people  know this,  but my dad lost two boys.  I was supposed to have  two older brothers  and the SIDS took  two of my dad's kids out  back in the day.  And I did not know that.  Yeah, so this is a big one.  I mean, you just depressed  the hell out of all of us.  It's already raining here  in New York  and then we had to hear that.  Oh my God,  let's try to keep it fun.  But it's a great cause  and he's doing a good thing. 
[02:26:30]  I'm just wondering  if he thinks karma  is actually going to  like even out  by being a good guy  when you've been a douche  your whole life.  All of a sudden  he drags me into sadness.  I'm admitting that  my dad had two kids  he was supposed to have.  Wait, alive.  I didn't want to admit that today.  Thanks for ruining our show, Don.  Really?  Thank you guys.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Let's post that info too.  I'm just in the morning program.  It's 27FDR. 
[02:27:00]  Please welcome once again  to the I'm just in the morning program.  Who?  Who?  Levon Helm,  the great Levon Helm  from the band.  Right.  And you're welcome  for all the support  that we all gave you.  No thanks for Jimmy.  I know too.  No thanks for Jimmy.  Jimmy's the one  reading the plugs  and everything.  What the hell, man?  Jimmy just gets shit on.  It's just like a dummy  in front of a fucking HBO camera.  It's going to be shot in the face.  That's a good card though, man.  It's 1-877-866-6464. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  And is it wrong?  He said something different.  What?  Just correct him.  Yeah.  Watch it.  Watch it.  Just gentlemen.  WABCradio.com.  They actually have really,  I was going to mention,  but he wouldn't have recognized  the name,  so why say my name?  That there's certain  things you can bid on.  Goose Gossage,  autographed baseball.  A weekend for two  at Kimberly Hotel.  With a dinner,  ladies,  diamond encrusted watch.  It really is good, man.  It's, uh...  So go to WABCradio.com.  We love Imas.  Good cause.  You know what's funny 
[02:28:00]  about doing, like,  a simulcast with Imas' show?  You can tell,  just by his tone of voice,  he is nervous as hell  that we're going to say  something really stupid.  Oh, I know.  And someone has their finger  right on the hang-up.  And then he...  It goes well,  but he's like,  all right, it went well.  Let's get him off the air  before this goes far but wrong.  Let's not take any chances  over here now.  They didn't say anything bad.  And that's why we push it  a little further  because we're like,  I know he's nervous.  Why are you getting rid of us?  We're killing for you.  He does get rid of us.  Dude, I just wanted to get  a Jim Norton reference  in there for silence.  Right.  Ah!  Ah! 
[02:28:30]  That's the noise  you would have heard.  That's Jim Norton.  Ah!  Yeah.  But yeah,  there's good stuff  you can buy.  Yeah.  Or bid on, I think,  exclusive items you can buy.  I want the goose  gossage baseball, actually.  It's a good cause.  How much is that  goose gossage baseball?  Seriously, I want that.  You want the goose  gossage baseball?  I do.  I have a few signed balls.  $15 billion.  You could have got one  perhaps less than that, Ant.  Wasn't he signing books  the same time  you were signing books?  Oh, don't be so sweet.  That was Sparky Lyle.  Oh.  But I didn't know  until I got there.  I got him wrong.  I got my pictures wrong.  You got your mustachioed pictures wrong.  Was it Rolly Fingers? 
[02:29:00]  Rolly.  Rolly.  I call him Rolly.  Oh, that's why I like you.  All right, Borat talks  about his cock.  Ooh.  Yes.  Your cock is actually  in this quite a bit.  My what?  Well, I guess he...  My what?  He came out with  some kind of book, I guess.  I don't know about  the Borat book.  In the book,  he's shown off his cock a lot.  Your cock is actually  in this quite a bit.  My what?  Your cock.  My cock.  Your cock.  My cock.  Yes, your cock.  Oh, my cock.  Yes, your cock.  My cock. 
[02:29:30]  Yes.  My cock.  Drink a cock.  No, that's a coke.  Coke, coke, coke.  Yes.  But you say my cock.  Yes.  My cock.  It's actually photographed  quite nicely in this.  I have, yes,  I have a very nice  photograph of my cock.  Yes.  Yes.  And how come?  What's with...  Are you showing off?  Is that what this is about?  Yes, I have a very nice  crumb.  I have a circumference  of 4.7 inches.  And I would like  to show this... 
[02:30:00]  My cock.  My cock.  I don't know why.  It just makes me  fucking laugh.  Also, I show the photograph  of my sons  with his glorious  crumb,  or as you say,  a cock.  A cock.  And we show also  there are photographs  of me and my sister  during the Feast of Shurik  making a romance.  Woo-hoo!  Yeah.  You know that's not legal  in most countries.  Why not?  It's an incestual thing  that they don't really like.  No, she is pretty. 
[02:30:30]  Do you have photos  of you with no clothes?  Um, yes.  I would like to see, please.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Very nice.  Where was that from?  Just some...  I don't know.  Some...  It looks like  an internet TV show  or something.  So I don't like  when they go with it.  What, the interviewer?  I liked the old days  before anybody  knew who he was.  Right.  A-W is better!  But I liked the...  But I didn't like 
[02:31:00]  the movie at all.  Only because...  You didn't like Borat?  Not even a little.  Oh my God,  it gets better  the more you watch it, Jimmy.  I just didn't like it.  But I'm not saying  it was a weak movie.  I just...  Why did you like it?  I liked the parts  that really were  with just the public.  Like, but after a while  he got so famous  it was hard to do.  Like, I didn't...  The wrestling scene  where the guy  put his ass in his face?  Nothing for me.  Really?  If that had just been  a movie movie  I would have loved it.  But knowing, like,  his clips that were  with real people  where they really hate him  and like...  Yeah.  It was hard for me  to watch that 
[02:31:30]  in a fucking movie.  Like, the Pam Anderson shit  I didn't care about.  No, that sucked.  The hooker,  the black hooker.  I didn't care about  any of that stuff.  But, like,  the scene with the way  he brought the bag  of shit down...  Yeah, yeah.  If I may,  it was a panic.  And the Jews.  I liked when he was  with the Jews  and said they were  shape-shifting  and he was throwing  money at them.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  But even that was,  like, movie stuff.  But it was still...  I guess I liked  the real stuff better.  Finally, Borat  talks about  the interviewer's chest. 
[02:32:00]  Listen to this.  Best description  of boobs ever.  You have  wonderful chests.  Thank you.  They are  like  two shaved  goat's bladders  full of urine.  Oh,  that's sexy.  Thanks.  You make  a very nice  and much cheese  from the meals.  Oh,  you know what?  I never have.  You have never  made a cheese  from your teeth?  Mm-mm.  I am sure  you would make  it a very salty one.  Is there, like,  a trick to it? 
[02:32:30]  I mean,  because I have not  been able to  laxate on my own.  You squeeze  very much.  It is important  to first  make a pregnant,  then you have  the child  and sell it  to the West,  and then make  a squeeze  of a cheese.  She's like,  okay,  I don't know  how to deal  with this.  I'm done  with you.  There you go.  I can't wait  until he does  Bruno.  Yeah.  That fucking  gay one  is really funny,  too.  Yep.  What's his other 
[02:33:00]  character again?  He's got three.  I think he's  the greatest.  He's very talented.  Very talented man.  Yeah.  Go to YouTube.  Everyone's asking  where you can find that.  I don't know.  It was one of the  top videos yesterday  in the comedy section,  I believe.  Oh, it was?  What?  Here's the girl  with the Tourette's  yelling the N-word  in front of black people.  Really?  Yeah, Danny said  we played it,  but I don't remember,  so we're going  to play it again today.  I forgot why 
[02:33:30]  this came up.  How old a gal?  I don't know.  Is she a teenager?  Yeah, late teens,  maybe early 20s,  somewhere around there.  Well, when I see people,  I sometimes say  what I'm thinking  about them,  but I don't mean it  kind of thing.  N-ca!  N-ca!  Like that, kind of,  but I'm not racist  and I just can't help it  and I feel really guilty  afterwards.  N-ca!  Yeah.  Ignoring the tics  is the best policy  because to pay attention  to them can make them worse, 
[02:34:00]  but it's easier said  than done.  N-ca!  N-ca!  N-ca!  N-ca!  Oh my God!  Are you kidding me?  That's a hell  of an affliction to have.  That last part,  by the way,  she's in a store  and she's shopping  with her mother  and the reason  she started ticking  like that  was because  there was a black person  that was shopping  probably about  six feet from her.  Wow.  Why would you  take her out of the house  ever?  Never let her out!  Why would you  let her leave the house?  Because you're going  to get punched 
[02:34:30]  in the face.  Moved to Alaska.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  What did the person do?  The black person  in the store?  Anything?  Did they hear it?  No, from what I remember,  either she was just  pretending that she  didn't hear it  or she just  honestly didn't hear it.  Right.  Unbelievable.  She says it in like  a friggin' weird  Linda Blair  possessed voice.  Why?  Not a sweet little voice.  Blurts it out like that.  I don't know what happens  but she turns  into a devil girl.  Piece of devil girl. 
[02:35:00]  We're going to take  a quick break.  We're going to bring  the crew in?  We're bringing the  audience in here  to get a little energy  for this rainy Friday  here in New York City.  Nasty.  When we get back  we got a retard  as a front man  for a band.  This is going to be  terrific stuff today.  Gotta love it.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  His name was  Stephen Carr.  How did that song  play?  Pendulum.  Pendulum.  Yeah.  Yes, Pendulum.  Hey guys,  you didn't say 
[02:35:30]  hi to Kenny  as he walked in.  You know,  the audience  usually at the same time  they say hi Kenny  when Kenny appears.  The hell is this?  Like Wonderama?  Exactly.  A walk-a-dope,  a walk-a-dope,  a walk-a-dope.  Alright,  any time now audience.  Hi Kenny!  That was good.  Very well coordinated.  And Pat Duffy,  come here before break.  You alright today?  Yeah, I'm okay.  Oh Pat,  you got so crazy yesterday  you were like a devil boy.  Insane Pat. 
[02:36:00]  You alright?  You're better today?  Uh, yeah, I guess.  I've spent a lot of time  to think about it, so.  What do you think?  Uh, it was just an epic fail  on my part.  Why?  It was not.  Are you kidding me?  We pushed every button  until we got that reaction.  I know, I sat in my car  listening to you yesterday  and I'm just like,  ugh, disgusted at myself.  Huh?  I just,  there's so many parts  where I was like,  oh, I could've said this  and I could've said this.  Let me inform you of something.  Would've been a lot better.  When I,  I'm a comedian  and I do it for a living.  When I first started  coming to the O&A show,  they enjoyed the jokes.  What really got me on the show  was I got arrested, 
[02:36:30]  uh,  I fuckin' ate an ice cube  out of a stripper's asshole.  Remember that.  So I had my fuckin' share of things.  Not on your level,  like I couldn't,  I don't have the guts  to do that stuff,  but I would've invited the guts,  so.  Yeah.  You know,  get a hold of yourself.  You're doing good.  Thank you.  Can we take pliers  to your testicles today?  Steve said no.  I already wanted to.  What is,  what is Steve doing?  His job!  He's one of the guys  fuckin' fire!  He's ruining the show!  What is the producer doing?  Not letting us crush  a guy's balls?  We're not crushing his balls.  Oh, can we kiss him?  How about the slow, 
[02:37:00]  how about the slow squeeze  until he goes out?  Oh, no!  You can take the loose skin  of the ball bag,  and you can put them  in the pliers,  and you squeeze a little bit,  and then you do a little twist.  Yeah, I wanted to,  I wanted to take vice grips  and clip them onto my balls.  That's, uh,  that's insane.  Why would you do,  why would you want to do that?  Well, the skin is okay,  I think the skin,  not the ball,  but the skin is okay.  Oh, right on a testicle,  right on a nugget.  Let's do twisties.  And just squish it in there.  Let's do plier twisties today.  Steve, what are you doing?  Plier twisties.  What? 
[02:37:30]  What, Steve?  We could twist his scrotum.  Steve, what's wrong?  We're allowed to twist scrotum stuff.  Yeah, scrotum,  as long as it's not enough  to catch the voice  and really hurt him.  What's your problem, Steve?  I have to watch out  for him hurting himself,  because he'll do it  if you ask,  so I have to be the guy  who jumps up and goes,  excuse me,  don't ask him to staple  his forehead again,  because the company  gets really mad.  Oh, I remember that one.  Yeah, that was good stuff, though.  Yeah.  Good stuff.  No.  It's not good.  Well, Steve,  you actually come in here  acting like you're all  That's right, I do.  Sorry.  My new character.  That's how you executive produce. 
[02:38:00]  I ruin things.  So what good is Pat Duffy  if he can't do his thing?  We have to encourage Pat  to do more creative things.  Boring.  Oh, boy.  No, don't listen to him.  All right.  Well, we're going to get  the crowd in here next.  We're going to get into  this retard doing the fronting  for this fine band.  Sounds great.  And other things.  Lane Bryant.  Including the soccer star  that was busted with a tranny.  Oh, Ronaldo.  Yes.  Good old Ronaldo.  Ronaldo.  It's a good story. 
[02:38:30]  All on the way.  We'd like to point out  that the actors involved  do not always exhibit  the communication,  sensitivity,  or intimacy  that are essential  for sustaining  real-life  interpersonal relationships.  It's the OPN Show.  We're retarded,  you know,  broken-down people,  but the audience  is just the fucking  drooling mongoloids  that are chained to the wall  that can't even raise  their hand up.  So we're like a little  better than them,  and they're going to  fucking listen.  The OPN Anthony. 
[02:39:00]  Is this Boundary?  Oh, nice.  What mics are on  for those boys over there?  That one?  We're back with  the OPN Anthony Show.  We got the audience  in studio today.  Say hi, guys.  Let's get a little...  Yeah, see, they're right.  Oh, wow.  They're pretty much  right behind Jimmy's head.  Jimmy can't see them.  Jimmy, you want to  face them?  I wouldn't trust them.  Oh, the fucking tunes  are kicking here.  Well, this is Boundary. 
[02:39:30]  Come on.  Boundary.  Does it ever kick in,  or is this just  the instrumental?  No.  Not even after those...  Fucking rock.  It's really not that bad.  No, it's horrid.  Oh, Willis. 
[02:40:00]  Here it goes.  No, there you go.  There it goes.  There it goes.  There it goes.  There it goes.  Yeah.  My blood's getting cold  You can change me into something  But I'm just getting cold  When you see me come  And let's get out of my way  That dance alone is bringing back the other way 
[02:40:30]  What about you, Jay?  Paint it out, paint it out, Foundry, yes.  Get out of my way.  Damien Thomas.  What's that voice he puts on?  I agree with Damien from Akron.  He says, Foundry sounds pretty cool.  That sounds a bit like Joy Division.  That's obscure, but kind of true.  E-Rock, what do you got?  Oh, hold on.  You know what?  I've always wanted to do this.  Could you leave?  Like for good?  I've always wanted to do this.  You're fired.  We're going to do sitcom rules today, okay? 
[02:41:00]  So when a character walks onto the set,  You guys got to applaud and stuff.  But E-Rock has to know when to walk in.  Like Lenny and Squiggy,  You have to listen for your cue.  You know how someone would say,  Lenny and Squiggy,  Too bad there's no one stupid.  Hello!  Right.  Yes.  We're doing sitcom rules today,  So when people come into the studio,  You guys got to pay attention.  You got to applaud like a studio audience, so.  Okay.  Like, you know,  Because I'm actually enjoying my yogurt.  Yeah, yeah.  How is that?  But I don't know,  I kind of want a pork roll sandwich,  Because I love eating pig! 
[02:41:30]  Well, hello, E-Rock!  Hi, E-Rock!  Hi!  And if you're a really big star of our sitcom,  You got to wait for the applause to die out  Before you deliver your fine line  For the Opie and Anthony show.  Sitcom rules.  I like it.  What do you got, E-Rock?  Whenever the Foundry song comes on,  Steve freaks out,  And he turns all the speakers off in the office.  He's like,  I can't listen to this,  I can't listen to this.  You're out of my way! 
[02:42:00]  You're out of my way!  That's what all listeners do, too.  Oh!  Oh!  Yes.  The pendulum is swinging the other way?  Yes.  Pendulum swings both ways.  What a wonderful name for a song.  You're out of my way!  Swings both ways,  Like Steve, yes.  Which way will the pendulum swing today?  That's right, today.  What goes in my mouth,  Nobody knows.  Boys, men.  Boys, men.  We're also doing audience participation today.  Danny is handing out the paper and the pens. 
[02:42:30]  Yes.  We need questions for these guys.  What do we got today?  Favorite ice cream.  Yeah, that's always a good one.  Van, could you get me the Lysol, please?  That's fine.  It is so bad.  That one doesn't stink.  You're embarrassing me.  No, no, it really smells very poorly.  You're making me feel bad about myself.  It's yogurt fart.  We need questions for these guys,  so what do we got?  Blueberries or strawberries?  Well, we do a lot of the sex questions.  Those are always easy.  Yeah.  How about something different? 
[02:43:00]  All right.  Get out of my way.  Get out of my way.  How about this?  Your biggest non-sexual secret.  Hmm.  Your biggest non-sexual secret.  It's sex.  We've always done sex.  That's true.  People have a lot of, like,  they've stolen from work.  There's an invalid that they go over and fucking...  Kept company with a Negro.  Well...  Oh, that's all.  I said secrets, not shame.  You laid down with a what?  Laid down. 
[02:43:30]  Have some molasses.  No, but, like, you know...  Non-sexual secret?  Yeah.  Because we always do...  Oh, let me say...  Well, you know...  Dad!  Yeah, please pontificate.  Where's Kenny?  Dad!  Is Kenny still here?  No, Kenny left.  Oh, Kenny left.  Why?  He's missing his big sitcom entrance.  No.  We're doing sitcom entrances today.  All right, so you want to do that?  Yeah.  How about a follow-up question, too?  A second question they could answer?  Because maybe some of these guys don't have an answer to that first question there, Jimmy. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, I'll bet they do.  Yeah?  Um...  Confessions are always good, too.  Yeah.  All it does.  Yeah.  Confess to something.  Murder.  What's kind of biggest secret?  Mayhem.  Right?  Yeah, it's very similar to what...  I guess you're right.  It's kind of on the same lines.  How about...  Well, I guess all this is technically confessional.  Danny, you got one?  You're pretty good.  You've been working with these crowds for a while.  Well, I think they should probably also just do... 
[02:44:30]  I'm sure they have stories that they might feel are airworthy that don't necessarily fit  the criteria of secrets.  Okay.  So they should probably write that down as well.  How about...  Good point.  How about this?  The funniest story you have.  That's real.  Don't bullshit.  Everyone has to have a funny...  A humorous anecdote from your life.  Like, let's say one time you were out in public and you realized that you had your  hands on your hips and you were wearing a baseball cack.  Baseball cack.  Baseball cack, huh?  You were wearing a baseball cack. 
[02:45:00]  I'm sorry I did that.  That's right.  And you were like, I meant to get a hat, but it's a cock.  It's on my head.  I was trying to shit on stupid for his fucking hat turned back.  You're not Johnny Appleseed.  I wish you were.  That might have been funny.  I'm not embarrassed, though, you know.  You lost him at cack.  Yeah.  No, I didn't.  Yeah, you did.  All right, start writing.  Start writing, put him in a hat, and then you don't have to admit to what you're writing  down, by the way.  That's the beauty of this game.  But if you want to, you certainly can.  Hey, Don Imus, after we got off the air, he went to a music guest, and then he had this 
[02:45:30]  to say about us.  I'm Mr. Wayne Program.  We're reporting in the final half hour of the 19th Annual Radiothon for the Tomorrow's  Children's Fund, CJ Foundation for SIDS.  I'm Mr. Cattle Rancher, kids with cancer.  We are at $1,168,951.  And thanks to Opie and Anthony, I don't know why they want to keep hurting my feelings,  but that's fine.  It makes them feel good.  It's great. 
[02:46:00]  It goes that way.  But they really have it.  They were great last year, and they've been enormously supportive.  Blah, blah, blah.  How about this?  That's nice of Don.  Yeah, I guess partially.  Why?  He didn't thank you, Jimmy?  Because he didn't thank you.  I don't even need to thank you.  How about just a fucking hello?  How about a I'm alive?  Just acknowledge that I'm alive.  Not even, but just a hello.  So, uh.  Hello, Jim.  Yeah, that would be nice.  Yeah.  How about that?  Something.  Just a hello.  You didn't even get a hello. 
[02:46:30]  I know.  Ah.  I still love them.  Got Opie and Anthony on the phone.  They do a show without a third person.  No, but I don't.  Just a complete.  Instead of not even saying hello, he just completely blows.  Blows you off.  But this is what annoyed me.  He's never heard of our show.  That's the problem.  Oh, yes, he has.  I don't think he has.  Yes, he has.  No, he hasn't.  He's like, uh.  Yes, he has.  Well, thank you both for your support.  Yeah.  What do you think?  They come in and fucking flip the switch?  Everyone supported you.  What do you think?  They supported you against the rest of the crew? 
[02:47:00]  No, fire him.  And they were like, no, keep him.  And we're like, well, all right.  I could take that cowboy hat off and take a dump in it.  I wouldn't put it back on his head, though.  I have too much respect for him.  That's good.  But I would leave it on his desk with a lot of it.  And then he would have to look at it awkwardly and try to figure out what to do.  Who's is that?  Because it's his favorite hat.  Who's shit in my hat?  And they'd go, Jim Norton.  He'd go, oh.  Oh, that guy.  Who?  Who?  Jimmy, you know a thing or two about trannies, right?  A thing or two?  How about a thing or nine, if I'm lucky? 
[02:47:30]  No, there's not much to know.  They're fucking, they're women who have extras.  Yeah.  No, they're not.  They are!  They're men.  Oh, please.  You just lie.  In dresses.  Why do you lie?  They got balls.  They got fucking dicks.  They're very courageous people.  You're right.  What makes it a chick?  Thanks, man.  What makes it a chick, though, Jimmy?  Exactly.  Because they could...  Duh!  Suck your dick.  Fucking sucking.  Lick their assholes.  What makes it a...  They got tits.  Come on. 
[02:48:00]  What are we, silly?  But they're fake tits.  Weird ones that look all...  They're fake.  They look all cockeyed.  Yeah, you laugh.  They go off, like, in two different directions.  Yeah, one's going that way, one's going that way.  Cock's in the middle.  What do you want from me?  Yeah.  Anybody in the audience have a tranny story?  No, of course.  None of these guys do.  How about fucking the shoe bomber right here in front?  Richard Reed.  You got one?  Yeah?  All right.  None of them have a good story?  All right.  Here's a soccer star getting caught with a tranny. 
[02:48:30]  One look at Ronaldo's seaside home and it's clear the Brazilian striker has done very well  from football.  But ruining his golden image took just one night and three transvestites.  This was the worst decision of my personal life.  It took on a very big dimension and had worldwide repercussions.  It'll stain my personal life forever.  This is one of the people causing Ronaldo so much trouble.  After a fight with his girlfriend, the football star met three call girls at a motel, only 
[02:49:00]  to discover those girls were actually men.  I've done something really stupid in my personal life.  We're all subject to making mistakes and I made a mistake in looking for this.  When I saw that they were transvestites, I tried to stop there and go home.  It was then the extortion started.  After nearly a week in hiding, Ronaldo told Brazilian television he didn't have sex with  any of the prostitutes or used drugs.  But police are considering whether to charge one of the transvestites with extortion after  Ronaldo was asked for money to keep the story quiet. 
[02:49:30]  Ronaldo is off football as a knee injury heals.  It remains to be seen if his public image can also recover.  Wow.  He had a bad day.  Three of them, Jimmy.  What's that about?  Oh, no.  Just a big coincidence.  You think so?  Yeah.  Three.  Trannies in Brazil are very passable.  Believable.  Yeah.  So it's not as bad as the hack jobs that happen in America?  Yeah, there's some awful ones.  Why is that? 
[02:50:00]  Is that because you feel the men have better asses?  What's that?  I don't even look at a guy's ass.  It grosses me out.  Terrible.  But they seem to do surgeries better there.  But Ronaldo is such a famous guy.  He's not as big as Pele, but he's the biggest Brazil soccer star.  He's a god in Brazil.  Right.  Where is dummy going?  Which one?  Sandy.  Oh.  Sandy Kane.  He can fuck anybody he wants.  Apparently he can. 
[02:50:30]  Men.  He already got bored.  I don't know.  Ugh.  Oh my god.  Are you just a gas fucking...  Like that 9,000 year old volcano.  It's been erupting.  Just keep eating more yogurt.  Those big blasting yogurt parts.  Just bubbling out of his ass.  I call it yoghurt.  Yoghurt.  Hey, uh...  Sandy Kane was supposed to come in for something else that got cancelled at the last minute.  Come here, Sandy Kane.  Funeral.  Funeral. 
[02:51:00]  A funeral.  Danny's collecting the, uh...  Hi.  Eh.  Eh.  Hey.  The answers from the listeners, and we should have that in front of us in a couple minutes  here.  Should she bring her guitar?  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  Yeah, of course.  Let's hear her sing.  Hi, Sandy.  Sandy Kane.  How are you?  Good, baby.  Right there.  No, you can sit over there.  It's a better spot for you.  Right there.  VIP.  Nice cheeks.  Yeah.  What do you got going on?  I have important penises.  What?  Why do you got a guitar? 
[02:51:30]  Because I'm the naked cowgirl.  Oh, good.  Okay, you want to do naked cowgirl?  Yes.  Wait, can you get in front of the audience and get naked?  Does it smell in here or what?  No.  It stinks.  Where is the homeless guys?  No, there's no homeless guys.  Wait, wait.  The big reveal in front of the audience here.  I'm a little tippy-ton, but my fart offends her.  Sandy, in front of the fucking audience.  You don't like tits?  No, we try to do this in such a way.  That's when you're breast exam.  Oh, my God.  I forgot how annoying this is.  Yeah, she'll just go on. 
[02:52:00]  You don't like tits?  Good point.  No, you don't like tits.  No, I hate them.  Sandy, microphone.  Yeah, fuck them.  What do you guys think of Sandy Kane?  This is the real deal, huh?  Too old.  Too old, man.  Man.  Hey, Sandy.  What?  I'm glad I got here, folks.  I mean, I was waiting an hour in the rain for you guys.  There she goes.  Really?  Sandy Kane.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  You didn't melt?  Some guy picked me.  I hitchhiked here, so it was cool.  From where?  I gave him a blowjob on the way. 
[02:52:30]  Sandy, from where did you hitchhike?  Are you lying?  43rd and 9th.  Yeah, she didn't hitchhike.  I said, I'll give you a blowjob if you take me to Opie and Anthony.  Oh, O and A.  Yay.  Okay.  Sandy Kane.  Sandy Kane, do you listen?  Okay.  We got a...  Cherry.  Oh, a cherry.  No.  We got a fine audience there.  I'm excited here, man.  You want to work the crowd a little bit?  Definitely.  And tell everybody out in Radioland what you're seeing in front of you? 
[02:53:00]  Take the mic and just kind of work the crowd.  You're really good at this.  What am I seeing?  Get to know people.  Yeah, get to know people.  Let's go.  You're good at this.  Okay.  All right.  I am the naked cowgirl now,  so I'm out in the street on 46th Street and Broadway  if any of you guys want to see me when the sun is out.  No.  Who are you, man?  You're so hot?  Look at all the ugly ones, man.  George Clooney liked me.  Yeah.  George Clooney liked me.  I mean, but you.  What's so hot about you?  That you're putting me...  Oh, shitty.  You know?  I'm not saying I'm hot, but Jesus Christ. 
[02:53:30]  Jesus Christ is hot.  Is he?  No, I mean, you think you're hotter than me?  Oh, yeah.  Why?  What's so good about you?  Do you have one good feature, man?  Do you have a big dick?  What?  I've been told.  You eat pussy good?  What?  You eat out?  I mean, what is so hot about you?  How come all the uglies, like, put me down and the good-looking ones don't?  I don't care.  I don't care.  You don't know?  I don't care.  You don't care.  I'm clustered.  Okay. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, you want me...  Oh, I thought you don't like me.  You want me to take my clothes off, man?  You want to see my hemorrhoid or what?  No.  Come on.  No.  Ah.  Who likes hemorrhoids here?  He's got a big dick, though, Sandy.  He said he's had a big dick.  How do you know?  How do you...  Let's see it.  Oh, no, it's quite all right now.  Uh-huh.  That's right.  If you really had one, you'd take it out.  No, it's quite all right now.  If you were a black man, you'd take it out.  What are these, 50 questions?  No, I'm just saying that you...  No, but you're the one...  In fact, you... 
[02:54:30]  You know, I'm just saying that you are not so hot, man, to say that.  You know, in fact, you could lose some weight.  You could get a nose job.  You could shave, man.  You could shave your beard.  I hate...  Except he's cute.  I like him.  He's cute, man.  Now, he's hot.  He likes Pat Duffy.  Besides, I like Pat Duffy.  Shut up.  Okay, shut up.  Thank you.  All right, Sandy Cain.  Sandy Cain.  What else do you see in the audience?  Focus.  Okay.  God. 
[02:55:00]  Anything else you see in the audience?  Okay, I know.  I'm abusing him.  Okay.  Who else?  Just speak your mind.  Okay, speak my mind.  How are you, man?  I like him.  He's cool.  He's got...  You know, he's like, I'm going to take my clothes off for him, in fact.  Ooh.  Any tips?  Ooh.  I got my first tip today for that blowjob.  So, you know, he tipped me.  That's how good it was.  But, you know, I wasn't in love.  I mean, when I'm in love with a guy, I can give a better blowjob.  But that's what I'm looking for.  My next... 
[02:55:30]  So, I don't know.  He's getting married.  Oh, wow.  He's getting married?  Yes, sir.  Oh, great.  What's your name?  Barry.  I've got one more.  Barry?  Yeah.  And where's your bachelor party held?  What kind of place?  I have no idea.  Hopefully, a place with a kiddie pool.  Oh, nice.  Kiddie, K-I-D-D-I pool?  Why, Barry?  I just wanted to get dirty.  Before you get married?  I didn't even get my cocoa.  Is your last name McMartin?  Kiddie pool. 
[02:56:00]  All right, Sonny Kane is getting...  We've got a dancer for you.  ...kind of naked.  I can't wait.  This is my red, white, and blue.  This is my new image.  You know, I just want to say that I'm very excited.  I finally got a job on 46th Street and Broadway as a naked cowgirl.  And I'm not going naked.  It's not a job.  I'm just going like that.  You're panhandling.  I got my...  Pretty much.  I got my Opie and Anthony shit on.  Yeah, I see that.  And Opie and Anthony on, you know, on my hat.  Yep.  And everyone that takes a picture not only takes me home, but takes you guys home to, like, 
[02:56:30]  Japan.  I meet people from all over the country.  Brazil, Arizona.  It's Times Square, we know.  You don't have to describe Times Square to anybody.  You guys want...  Show the hemorrhage.  Show whatever's going on in the genital wart.  You got to give it...  Yeah, you got to show it.  It's not a genital wart.  The doctor said it was.  You're right.  We're in disagreement.  What can I tell you?  Jim, Jim.  The doctor did say it was a cliff.  The conjoined twins.  It was what?  A cliff.  But it's not a wart, he said.  Yeah.  I don't believe him.  Show the audience.  She.  Show the audience.  It's nothing. 
[02:57:00]  It's a little grung.  It's just a little grung.  Show the audience.  Okay.  Ow.  Ooh.  I know I look better from the back.  She's bending over.  Don't I?

A dollar tip I need.  Come on, now.

Shoot.  A lap dance.  $2.  One for each...  Take care of him.  Now, see, that's the man I like.  How much did he give you?  I like a man like that.  Show him the fucking thing.  What do you think?  Show him the thing.  How much did he just give you?  Opie man...  I mean, I like a man who fucking...  It takes a 10 out instead of a dollar.  I want to give you the lap dance.  You got to take care of him.  He's better looking.  Sandy, you got to show him the whole...  Show him the fucking roid. 
[02:58:00]  Let's go.  Really?  My roid finally made money.  Okay.  Well, my hemorrhoid or my...  Both.  Twato first.  Twato first.  Twato got like a big write-up in Radar Magazine.  Because he...  Because it looks like a radar.  Yeah.  He said, no, what is Twato?  I've been hearing about this...  Twato's more famous than you.  Yes.  And so I told him about...  Anthony named it.  Yes.  So he said, I guess, Anthony is the godfather of Twato. 
[02:58:30]  Well, I'm very proud.  Yeah, I mean, thank you for the...  You know...  Sandy, show them.  Will you show them?  Show them what?  Twato.  You have a lot of filler in your act.  Will you just get right to the fucking Twato?  It's all filler.  I made $10.  I paid my cab fare.  $10.  All right.  Show Twato.  I really didn't give the truck driver a blowjob.  We know.  We know.  I gave the cab driver a blowjob.  But anyway, who wants to see it?  Who wants to smell me?  No.  I like that.  I think it smells very, very sexual. 
[02:59:00]  Sandy.  All right.  Do you like that, man?  You like the smell of a woman's pussy?  All day.  Okay.  All day.  All day.  Whoa.  My type of man.  What about you?

Do you like shaved, pussy, or hairy?  Not that one.  Okay.  Hey, sir, on the floor, what does it look like?  You're right there.  It looks really bad.  Okay.  In what way?  In what way?  This is a center fall.  I was in center fall.  I was in center fall.

Oh, you just bend over.  I did not eat Mexican food yesterday, sir.  I think she has cancer.  No, I didn't, no.  Sometimes it's the food.  The food you eat, it's the food.

Do you know that, man?  Pat?  Pat, come on.  You're Irish. 
[03:06:30]  You know, man.  Just shut up.  Okay.  You have no answer, man.  Don't bother Pat Duffy.  Do you ever smell the tits that, you know, they do have a smell?  Yes.  Okay.  It smells like a clean girl.  Not like yours.  How do you know?  You never smell my tits.  And I don't want to.  Okay, all right.  So just shut up and continue.  Okay, all right.  It's your birthday boy.  Yeah, okay.  I'll never forget you, man.  I am not going to forget you, boy.  I'm going to have a wet dream about you tonight.  I'm telling you.  I'm telling you.  Take the mic out of her face for a second.  I see Johnny Fairplay has entered the studio over there. 
[03:07:00]  You asked us to bring a girl in for your girlfriend or your wife or whatever, and here's who we  brought in.  Michelle, we're still waiting.  No.  What is that growth?  That's called Twado.  You know, I was interviewed by Radar Magazine.  We got it.  Right already.  No, about Twado, man.  Twado was famous.  How do, I mean, how, how did he know about Twado?  I mean, that's all he asked about. 
[03:07:30]  Well, that's Twado.  Oh, my God.  Who are you saying again?  Twado was famous.  What the hell was that?  Fan mail on Twado.  Oh, I didn't bring two, though.  All right, Johnny Fairplay, listen, so there are emails going back and forth, and you said  you want us to get some girls for your girlfriend, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, here you go.  This is the one, man.  We're still waiting.  Anyone can get a hot girl for their girlfriend.  This is a little special.  John, you get in there and start first.  I'll be in behind you.  You go.  Warm her up.  I got my boy Mikey B from Survivor. 
[03:08:00]  He loves older women.  Mikey B, would you do this or what?  Hell no.  No?  I like him young.  Why are you supporting him?  I thought you said you like older women.  Yeah.  Come on, no, no.  That's what Fairplay said.  I didn't say that.  Oh, he didn't say that.  Five and under for me.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  Good rule of thumb.  You think he's cute, too?  He's handsome, right?  Who?  Which one?  What were you talking to?  Survivor guy.  Oh, he's a survivor guy.  Great.  Do I think he's cute?  He's a nice thimple. 
[03:08:30]  He's all right.  You know, I kind of like men that like me.  I mean...  Yeah, you're looking good, baby.  Blind.  That's the last time I was asked that on a date.  The guy was blind.  I said, but you don't even know what I look like.  He said, but I could tell you, I like you.  But he really was blind.  So what's your shtick?  What are you doing here?  What's my shtick?  Yeah, what do you got?  What's going on?  What do I got?  Yeah, what do you got?  I got two big titties.  Pull out your big titties.  Where did you come from?  Where did I come from?  My mother and father. 
[03:09:00]  Did you just barge in the place?  Did you get invited?  Well, I know ONA since WNEW days.  When they stuck a middle finger in my asshole.  And it started to bleed.  And they gave me preparation aids to go home with.  And so I had to take a...  It was like traumatic.  That's the first time I met ONA.  And you came back from it.  Right?  Right.  Where's your husband?  Huh?  Where's your husband?  Uh, where's my husband? 
[03:09:30]  She's not the marrying type.  She likes to get raped and stuff.  Yeah, I do.  Yeah.  How'd you know that?  Because you talk about it all the time.  I like to get raped?  Yeah.  Yeah, you call it rape.  Meanwhile, you were picked up by a hitchhiker.  And you blew him.  And he fucked you.  And then you say, yeah, it was rape.  Then we went out to breakfast.  Right.  I know, you told that story.  I'm not bullshitting.  Well, what can you do, man?  Let me tell you...  You don't go out to breakfast with rapists.  Let me tell you something.  I watch all these things that women get murdered. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  Because they...  The reason they get murdered is because they're not nice to fucking rapists.  Now, I hitchhiked and...  No, I hitchhiked and I had to be nice to the...  You know, and then I hitchhiked home because...  But you have to be nice.  When a man has his hands around your throat, you don't fight him and...  Hey!  Sorry.  No, but I'm just saying...  You say, hey, I love you.  I love you.  You're my friend.  Because they have your life in their hands. 
[03:10:30]  Don't you think?  Unfortunately.  So, I mean, that's why I'm still alive, man.  So, you do have breakfast with rapists.  You do, huh?  You had a free breakfast.  Breakfast with rapists.  And he happened to be a nice guy.  A nice guy, the rapist?  Except his feet stonked, but...  Yeah, otherwise...  Why did he have them in your pussy?  His feet were in my pussy.  How'd you know that?  Shut up.  He was a toe freak.  Jimmy, I had a nice conversation with Bob Odenkirk about you. 
[03:11:00]  Yes, two days ago, I was doing David Cross's new sitcom for HBO.  Oh, okay.  So, we were talking about the whole video game thing, and we were talking about Grand Theft Auto 4,  and people saying how bad it was, and I was saying how Michelle said it's not as bad as playing Monster Rain.  Oh, okay.  Nice.  But Bob put you over pretty huge.  Yeah, I did an anti-competent thing with him years ago in L.A. at the House of Blues.  Awesome, awesome. 
[03:11:30]  Good times, man.  Good times, good times.  Hey, you shut up, Sandy Kane.  I appreciate it.  Right?  For a couple of seconds.  I'm the naked cowgirl.  Well, get your guitar, Sandy.  Yeah, get your guitar.  Do a song.  Do a song for us.  I do make the song.  If we like the song, we'll throw money at you, okay?  Okay, great.  But take it off your bra and show those saggy tits.  I'll tell you one thing.  On the street...  Just grab the guitar.  Stop talking.  Just grab the guitar.  On the street, I don't care.  Less filler.  Grab the guitar.  I want to go topless, man.  Okay, go topless.  Go topless.  Because we understand you don't do it on the street. 
[03:12:00]  Big titties.  We don't do it on the street.  I know, we know.  So, I mean...  It's important.  It's not...  It is...  No, but...  It's fucking zildjian symbols on our tits.  I went topless, I didn't want to, and now I wanted to, and I don't have to, so it's  really strange.  Sandy, that's not interesting.  Show your...  It's...  Show your...  Show your asshole.  That's interesting.  Yes.  Of course it is.  Yes.  No, but it is like when I started working in peep shows, I couldn't do it, but everyone  else was doing it, so I did it.  Okay, cool.  Not that I like that that much, but...  Very cool.  Men masturbating on a screen. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So...  All right.  You're just running out of steam alone.  What are you doing?  Good director.  Oh, Naked Cowgirl, I like that.  It says Naked Cowgirl.  Why don't you face the audience?  Isn't the Naked Cowboy going to sue you?  He gave me a tip.  He gave me...  No, he's very nice.  Sue me.  For what?  For what?  What are they going to take?  Yes.  I want the genital wart and our hat.  I want to take it off like that old broad.  What do they...  No, he tipped me and he said, here, you know, thank you for coming, and then he's a little 
[03:13:00]  bit in awe right now because I'm getting a little more attention...  Some attention from him.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So, because I show him a twatto.  I don't show my tits, but I show twatto.  Anthony.  That is really not something, if I was coming to Times Square as a tourist, I would want  to see.  No.  It's like, hey, you know what I saw in New York?  They mention everything.  No, you'll never guess.  The Cloverfield hooker.  All right, so any kid's going to write it. 
[03:13:30]  Okay, this is just, um...  What's the name of the song?  It's called I'm the Naked Cowgirl.  Okay, good.  Well, I could do something else, but...  I'm just saying, please.  I have my O&A song, but I'm not going to do that.  All right.  Okay.  I think you've heard those, all of them.  I've been tits or what?  Just please say...  Take one home, I got two.  Wouldn't use the word like.  This guy.  Do you have a girlfriend?  No.  No, I could understand why.  Ooh.  No, I'm just saying.  No, I'm just saying.  You don't like women.  But me? 
[03:14:00]  Okay.  I should cut my nails, because that's how you should, but...  But anyway, I wrote this, and, uh...  Ooh.  Okay.  I think my guitar is out of tune, but...  Ah, fuck it.  Sounds better.  Feel free to throw money, if you...  Oh. 
[03:14:30]  Hey, throw money, man.  I respect money.  Um, okay.  What are you...  Ooh!  Hi, my...  Hi, my...  Whoa.  Hi, my name is Sandy Kane.  From Newark, New Jersey, I came.  I always wanted...  Fortune and fame. 
[03:15:00]  Now I'm doing the O&A show.  Oh, okay.  Now I know what song she's doing.  On XM Satellite Radio.  I'll be...  There...  Oh, but...  Manhattan...  Manhattan is my home.  Hmm.  Cause in Times Square, I'm never alone. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, I'm gonna be where the sun is shining on me.  I'm gonna show you Twido soon.  I'm the naked cowgirl.  That's a hit.  Yeah, singing my song.  With hardly any clothes on.  And...  Ooh.  Ooh. 
[03:16:00]  The naked cowboy is there too.  Oh, a little plug.  Showing his dick.  Ooh.  I used to live in Nashville, Tennessee.  But I'm originally from...  That's where I caught VD.  Newark, New Jersey.  And you know what?  I also lived in Miami.  Are you Jewish?  No.  I'm playing that.  Play it.  No, keep going, sir. 
[03:16:30]  Okay.  Okay.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, and I'm going to be on...  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  And it seems...  Opie has taken scissors and cut all of Sandy Kane's strings.  Opie took scissors and cut the fucking strings.  Oh!  Oh, that's, uh...  That's going to leave a mark. 
[03:17:00]  Sandy, let me see.  You can fix that.  I'm waiting for him to cut off a tape.  Boy, that really, uh...  That improved the sound.  Okay.  Sound good now.  That was Baron Leslie Nielsen.  I like Leslie Nielsen.  Okay, what happened?  Wow.  How am I going to go out on the street now?  Without strings?  What happened? 
[03:17:30]  I got my fucking strings.  Oh, shit.  What can you do, man?  Thank God.  Jim Norton gave me $25.  I can get...  Go to Manny's and get new strings.  There you go.  Fucking, that worked like a charm.  I didn't think you could get scissors through it that easy.  You know you could do it.  He's like, you know...  What can I do?  I mean, I'm not going to cry.  I'm not going to cry.  Nah, why would you do that?  I mean, here I practiced that song all night. 
[03:18:00]  See, you have a tissue?  Tissue, I don't even know you.  I get it.  I'm queen of the body dump jokes.  Sandy, I think there's only one thing...  I'm making money to Opie.  There's only one thing you could do now,  is just blow everybody, I guess.  Okay, well, uh...  I'm going to start with Anthony.  Nah, how about you start with our audience over there?  Okay, blowjobs.  Now, after this?  Hey, wait, I have a question.  Go ahead.  No, we can't do a blowjob in here,  but would you let somebody just kind of slap their penis against your cheek?  Definitely, I'd like that.  Who would slap their penis on our cheek? 
[03:18:30]  Mikey B.  Mikey B.  Mikey B volunteers.  Mikey B.  All right, Mikey.  Mikey.  He's excited.  He said no chance.  He's already got a little blood.  What about the guy who's in me?  He's cute.  No, you're cute.  Why not?  Who has the biggest dick?  Guy with the big dick will take it out.  Any black men here?  Any black men?  She says any black men here.  How can you not notice?  There's like 20 people.  What about Jim Norton?  Sam's half black.  Jim Norton? 
[03:19:00]  You showed me your dick that time.  Nice, nice.  Go ahead.  Oh, you're dead.  You have a lot of fans, man.  I mean, you take risks.  Yes.  Come on, you take, do it, man.  No.  You have a very nice dick.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Why'd you show her your dick?  Thank you.  Why wouldn't you?  No, thank you.  Dangling a steak in front of a shark.  Come on.  You know what I mean?  You felt my titties, right?  You did that.  Take your dick out and slap it.  No.  No.  Okay.  Why not?  Because I've done it all.  I've got to get one of the audience members to do it.  Okay.  Who should we get, Jim?  I don't know.  Whichever one has any guts.  Which one of you nuts has got any guts? 
[03:19:30]  Do you slap her instead?  No, you can't hurt a dick out, man.  Just, uh...  I dare you.  Hey, uh, Johnny Fairplay, what can we do with this thing?  Uh, put it out of its misery?  Just think.  Just think.  Pull it out the window.  Okay.  What's so hot about you?  Ooh.  I bet he has no hair, so he's wearing a hat.  I have plenty of hair.  Okay, nice.  He's got too much hair, actually.  Shouldn't hide it under that hat.  It's cold, bitch.  Probably always wears a shirt. 
[03:20:00]  Probably always wears a condom, too.  Ah.  Just kidding.  You never know.  He's protecting his hair, and he probably protects his dick, too.  Oh, wow.  Safe sex.  That's uncool.  Are you right?  So, you have a good dick?  Come on, slap it on my cheeks.  I'm going to fuck with that later.  Are you kidding me?  You're going to fuck with that later?  Fair play.  Come on.  You got it, didn't you?  No, I'll touch Twado.  Ah, we've done that already.  Yeah, right? 
[03:20:30]  Been there.  We had some guy lick it.  I got it licked here.  Come on.  Oh, God.  You just...  No one wants to take your dick out.  That's it.  I'm almost happily married.  I would if that wasn't the case.  You're almost happy?  Almost, yeah.  Oh, so what?  You're afraid?  Oh, you're afraid.  Yeah, he might leave me.  You never know.  Is it all right for him to do it?  Come on, John.  You can do it.  Please, please, let this be my wedding present for me.  I want to see this.  This is your batch of...  Wedding's off. 
[03:21:00]  Thanks, guys.  He's telling you you can do it.  Let's go.  I'm newly single for the Survivor finale.  Thank you.  When is the Survivor finale?  Sunday night is the season finale of Survivor Micronesia.  Fans vs. Favorites.  You can vote on CBS.com for your favorite Survivor.  Give them $100,000 through Sprint.  Mikey B, 1-5.  I think Johnny Fairplay, number five.  I don't know.  Whatever.  So, vote me.  The big thing I'm coming to promote is tomorrow night, Ring of Honor Wrestling at the Hammerstein 
[03:21:30]  Ballroom.  I believe primetime, Sam Roberts will be there.  Wow.  Oh, really?  My favorite part of the Than and Sam show.  Oh, no.  Wow.  You were actually available on short notice?  All long time.  Primetime.  He had to readjust his whole schedule this, Sam.  Are you on Survivor 2?  No, I was on Top Model.  Ah, she's beautiful.  I just had a baby four months ago. 
[03:22:00]  Look at that.  Damn, look at that.  It's right.  You just had a baby four months ago.  Unbelievable.  Working it.  All tight already.  Is that his baby?  Possibly.  According to him, yes.  She was on that Tyra show, man.  She hated Tyra.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah, Tyra Banks.  She's so nice, though.  She's all wig, right?  All wig?  Not that old.  Close.  No comment.  All wig, though.  Yeah, she has her wigs.  I thought she'd be nice, though.  Do you?  Why was she not nice, Tyra? 
[03:22:30]  She wouldn't talk to us unless the cameras were on.  She's a cunt.  Well, to put it, yeah, yeah, pretty much.  Do you think she was?  Yeah.  When the cameras were on, she's like, oh, hey, girlfriend, what's going on?  Cameras are off.  She doesn't even look at you.  You do not exist.  How big is her skull in person?  Okay, I saw her without a weave.  Damn.  She's awful, right?  Oh, my God.  What's the problem?  What?  She just, her forehead. 
[03:23:00]  That's the only problem, her forehead.  She has a head like Predator, right?  She's a big fucking...  She kind of looks like a tranny, really.  She's got kind of a tranny look to her.  Does she have short hair without the weave or no?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like probably about an inch, maybe.  Yeah.  Are her tits real?  She says they're real.  I don't know.  Next time I see her, I'll ask her.  You don't know.  I mean...  Yeah, I don't think she's giving me a great answer about that. 
[03:23:30]  The string's hanging off.  Well, you know, I mean, even the naked cowboy, you don't talk to people unless he's getting tipped.  So, in a way, like, rich people are like that, you know?  So, you can't knock that sometimes.  You know about the rich folk?  Yeah, when the camera's on, they're getting paid for that.  Hey, you know, there's a lot of people like that.  I'm not going to mention the person I was just thinking about.  Mention one.  Howard Stern is like that.  Really?  Opie and Anthony are like that.  Jim Norton is like that.  I met Jim at Stand Up New York.  I said, will you take a picture? 
[03:24:00]  No, later, later.  So, I mean, just saying.  You're saying that we have 30 pictures together.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I'm just saying, man.  I was a big fan.  I watched your show.  I said, Jim, I love you, man.  But we know each other.  Yeah, but I still love you, man.  Thank you.  I want a picture of you.  I'm going to say he's cost you.  But I would always take a picture of you.  This is Patricia Fields.  Very nice.  You like that?  Uh-oh.  He's going to do something.  No.  So, please.  I don't like that.  Uh-oh, Opie, man.  Please don't cut this, man.  Because it's hard to get red, white, and blue.  This is Patricia Fields.  They did sex in the city shit. 
[03:24:30]  Please.  No, Opie.  Look.  Ah-ha.  Look, see?  Stick that up your ass, Opie.  I'm walking.  Come on, man.  Oh, please.  Thank you for having mercy.  See?  He does love me.  No, I'm just saying thank you because it's...  Oh, I swear.  I mean, the strings...  All right, play another song.  I can't replace this.  Oh, that's right.  You can't.  No, I'm just saying.  I'm glad you didn't do that.  Or wash them.  Huh?  Wash them?  No, this is not new. 
[03:25:00]  Are they washable or no?  Yeah, I just washed them.  So when are you going to wash...  Oh.  No, I just did.  So, um, they're washable.  Red, gray, and blue.  I think we're going to take a break.  No, you're right, but it just...  All right, we're going to take a break.  This is not new.  All right, we're going to take a break.  And then we're going to, like, see what the listeners wrote down for the answer.  You mean no one's going to slap their dick on my cheeks?  I don't know.  We're trying, but...  You know, what a whim crowd.  We finally found something Johnny Fairplay won't do.  No, we're trying to fucking listen.  Fucking a whim. 
[03:25:30]  I mean, why do you listen?  I get it, man.  For an opportunity to take your dick out and slap the cheeks of the naked cowgirl.  Exactly.  What's wrong with you people?  Motherfucker.  Come on.  Bunch of queers.  Big man.  Really?  With your fucking uniform.  Big man.  There's no...  See, a black guy would do it.  Not that I'm prejudiced, man, but...  Can we carve gang signs into your back?  Too many white people here.  They don't fucking...  White people?  No, I mean, not that I'm prejudiced.  Give me the green.  White, black. 
[03:26:00]  But, God, if a black guy would do it.  A black guy would do it.  Do they not fucking like girls?  What the fuck?  Maybe they don't like Opie and Anthony.  I don't know, man.  Where's the black guy?  He would do it.  Come on, man.  That's why we're going to have a black fucking president.  Right.  Why?  Because he'd fuck you?  Because black men...  Black people, man.  They take risks.  We're going to take a break.  We're going to find a...  They take risks.  We're going to find one of these guys...  Take your wallet.  We're going to find one of these guys to slap his dick on your face, okay?  Great.  We're going to talk to Johnny Fairplay a little bit, a little bit, and then these guys wrote 
[03:26:30]  down answers to some questions we asked him.  Do we have some good ones?  It's small.  It's great.  It's just a dick.  All right.  I'll try and...  It just goes on and on.  This is ridiculous.  Shut up.  Sandy wants a dick slapped on her, and one of these guys better do it.  Pat Duffy?  I'm in.  Oh, second Pat.  You'll slap your dick on...  I'll probably punch her in the face.  With your dick.  We're working on your anger issues here.  You know that, right?  You're hot.  I mean, you can slap her as hard as you can with your dick. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah.  We're not going to stop you from that, but you've got to control the rest of your anger.  Spin around like the Tasmanian devil with your dick out and just hit her like  a chainsaw.  I bet he has a nice dick, see?  Should we think?  I'm going to say that Irishman or not true.  Are we going to do it after the break?  Sure, I'll do it.  Pat Duffy slaps his dick on Sandy Cain's face after the break.  I love you, Nate.  Ladies and gentlemen, the one, the only, Sandy Cain.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thanks. 
[03:27:30]  Thanks.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Ladies and gentlemen, joining Sandy Kane,

Opie and Dopey.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back here on XM Satellite Radio.  We've got a real nice crowd here today. 
[03:29:30]  We've got Johnny Fairplay, we've got his future wife who had his kid four months ago,  and her body snapped right back into shape.  See, Anthony, it's possible.  Oh, yeah?  Anthony thinks kids wreck the old body.  Yeah, I think kids, like, fuck it all up.  Wow!  Look at that.  That's four months after a kid?  Yeah!  That's, uh...  I actually have a booty now, too.  What, you take the kid out after four months?  One in a million.  She's one in a million.  Nice.  Wow, man.  There's not a hint of, like, lasagna belly. 
[03:30:00]  I know, right?  Congratulations.  You must be young.  How old are you?  Twenty-two.  That's key, too, I'm thinking of it.  Mm-hmm.  Get a little older, it makes it a little harder, I'm thinking.  So I have a couple other friends.  I've got Mikey B, who's on the new Survivor with me.  I've got Chet, who is on the new Survivor, also the flower girl at my wedding, and also  he mentioned on the way in the elevator, he has an 8.5 cut cock.  Nice.  Are you willing to take it out and slap it on some whore's face?  You never know what I'll do. 
[03:30:30]  I've done worse for less.  Do you have any girth?  Yes, it's nice.  It's thick.  Sandy Kane, you want to see an eight-and-a-half answer?  White noon, yes.  All right, get over here, because we've got to get into some other things.  I'll pass this time.  I'll pass this time.  All right, get a seat.  It'll be out before the week's over.  Just show her.  Just show her.  All right, with your disposable cameras.  Here, Sandy, I want to take a picture of you in the crowd.  He's going to knife me in the back. 
[03:31:00]  Now, that was the radio.  No, I feel bad about smashing your guitar.  Just get in front of everybody.  Yeah.  Oh, no, no.  Come on, no.  Look at my Opie man.  Just sit.  Just sit.  Have mercy.  Have mercy on an old woman here.  On an old woman.  He's screaming.  So if I took home a picture of a dick, it would help.  It's not easy getting laid at my age.  All right, shut up.  Where's Pat Duffy?  He's going to take his dick out.  All right, get her in a chair.  Let's do this in a minute. 
[03:31:30]  Pat, man.  What?  Hey.  What?  Hey, Chad, you want in on this?  Never let it return here.  He's a big guy with a big dick.  All right, here you go.  Sit down, Sandy Kane.  Sit.  Sit.  Sit down.  You can stand over here.  Come on.  There.  Stand right there.  Chad wants to get close to us.  Can I get to your dick though?  You want to see?  Definitely.  Look at him.  I'll just watch first.  You look a little like Opie man.  I tell you.  All right. 
[03:32:00]  Sandy Kane, sit the fuck down.  I'll tell you.  You can't tell if a guy's a big dick.  All right, you know what?  You really can't tell.  You tell.  Sam, I hope you're rolling.  Black guys have small dicks too.  Sure do.  Oh, no.  Black guys too.  Hi, Steve.  All right, I'm going to get over there to help out.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Uh-oh.  Opie, please.  I should bring a bodyguard.  Oh, boy.  That's what I'm going to get.  Pat, are you going to hit with your penis?  Sure.  Come on.  Let's get the sexy back in the show. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah.  Right?  I'll bring in sexy back.  Well, I guess just...  Keep it sleazy, baby.  Keep it sleazy.  Pull it out and smack her in the side of the face with it.  I keep easing on the sexy.  Okay.  Uh-oh.  He's like...  Oh, I can't see Steve.  You're cock walking.  Uh-oh.  Come on.  Sandy Kane, lean back so Pat Duffy can do this.  A stiff drink.  A stiff cock and a stiff drink.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Sandy Kane is sitting down.  Okay. 
[03:33:00]  Pat Duffy is in front of her, wearing his little combat shorts.  What about you, Opie, man?  Shut up.  Now, lean back.  Does that chair, like, go back?  Opie's dick.  Yes.  Go back.

Lean back and close your eyes.  Put it away, pretty girl.  Put it away, sweetie.  There she goes.  Watch him steal it back.  In the garter.  Oh, no, no.  Don't be fresh.  Okay, not you.  Him.  Put it away.  Lean back.  She's shoving the money in there.  All right.  Lean back, please.

I saw a 20, a bunch of fives.  Another probably close to 50.  Lean back.  Oh, wow.  It's not that much, OP.  Just lean back, please.  Do you work for 50?  Stop talking.  Stop talking.  Come on.  Lean back.  What is this now?  It's your slappiest dick in your face.  Oh, great.  I like that.  That's Duffy.  I look over there to see the... 
[03:35:00]  To see if it's big?  What?  And a bunch of vanilla yogurt has just been...  Sandy look.  It's like a Bukkake video.  I hope you just do vanilla yogurt on her.  Yeah, I want you to pay for this, man.  Yeah.  I want you to pay for this, man.  I need this to work, you know?  The wig?  Next time you'll shut your mouth.  Oh, gosh. 
[03:35:30]  Oh, no.  You step in the wig.  Huh?  It's all in the wig.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  You can't work with it like that.  Oh, shit.  What a bad shot on you.  Just threw my ass, man.  Looks like she has too much sunshine on her left arm.  Oh, God.  He got it all over like the left side of her wig and her left arm.  Wear the sequins and things.  How does that guy...  That's got to get cleaned.  You know, you have a disorder.  Yeah, I know I do.  You have a fucking disorder, man.  That's right, I do.  So do you.  You can't shut your mouth.  Yeah, well, fuck you, man.  Yeah, fuck you.  I can't work with this hair now. 
[03:36:00]  Well, I understand that.  I'm supposed to go after 46th Street and Broadway tomorrow.  It's raining.  No one wants to see you.  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  No guitar strings.  No week.  What am I going to do, man?  Well, go back to him and blowjobs for $2.  Okay.  Oh, God.  Look at this.  It's in your wig, though.  That's the problem, right?  Oh, God.  That's going to be rough.  You better take your wig off.  Take your wig off.  I'm not taking nothing off.  So, Pat, are you still slapping on the face of your dick?  How do you wash that off?  How do you wash that wig?  How the hell did I miss?  It's a fucking dick.  I don't know. 
[03:36:30]  How do you wash that wig for cleavage?  I hit her left arm.  Oh, God.  He missed by fucking yogurt.  I don't know.  He got all over her left arm.  Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah.  That is the weirdest place.  I was going for cleavage.  I bet she moved out of the wig at the last second.  It looks like the glove got ruined.  I ain't going to wash out.  Anthony, how can you work with him?  Huh?  What's wrong with you?  You have a disorder.  I know.  Yeah, you have a disorder.  You once said that I have a disorder and you're right.  Yeah.  But so does it.  But, Sandy, you're not going to be able to wash it out of the wig.  How do you work?  12 years old, man.  You never fucking grew up.  That's right. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah, I mean, throwing yogurt, cutting my guitar strings.  Yeah.  What is this, man?  When he gets married, he's going to abuse his wife.  Yeah, that's going to...  And beat his kid.  He's going to abuse his wife and, you know, take her implants and just rip them off.  She doesn't have implants.  That's your trap.  No, you're fucking wrong, man.  I could tell implants a mile away.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  O and A.  I got you, man.  She does have implants because I looked at like...  Shut the fuck up. 
[03:37:30]  I said, who's that woman with implants?  And then Opie says, oh, this is my future wife.  Oh, yeah.  That's exactly what I said.  Hallelujah, man.  I'm assuming this is not the first time this has happened to you in the studio.  What keeps on bringing you back?  Because I love Opie and Anthony and Jim.  See, I'm a masochist.  Thank you, Sandy.  All right.  My ex-husband was into S&M.  All right, now we're going to...  You know how I know?  He beats me.  Beats me.  All right.  Wait a minute.  That's wordplay.  Beats me. 
[03:38:00]  Get out of here.  He was into S&M.  You know how I know?  Beats me.  I like that.  Cool.  All right.  That's bullshit, actually.  What do you mean?  How did you fucking know he's in S&M?  I heard you.  Beats me.  All right.  Can Pat slap you with his penis, Sandy?  Come on.  Where is he?  I don't know.  He's hiding his cock.  Look at this.  Hey!  Paper towels are clean up.  Oh, thank you, man.  Now, clean it up.  Now, clean it up.  Now, clean it up.  Are they really real?  Guinea Crypt Keeper?  Yeah.  Are they really real? 
[03:38:30]  Did you buy them for her?  Shut up.  I'm jealous.  I love Opie, man.  Yeah, dude.  I had a wet dream about him, so...  Oh!  What is that?  Oh, boy.  That would be gravy.  Oh.  What was that?  What the fuck?  I didn't do it.  Why?  Shit!  Shit!  Ha!  Why in God's name would anyone do that?  What'd you dump on her?  Taco sauce.  No, gravy. 
[03:39:00]  No, wigsaw.  What is it?  Hey, I made some money, anyway.  Haha.  Okay.  Hey, it's good radio.  Right, Opie?  I didn't do anything.  Uh-huh.  You started it, man.  You rocked it.  I have like a whole meal here now.  I know.  I got chips.  I can eat, man.  I got yogurt.  I got fucking taco sauce all over there.  Look at all, honey.  The trout.  I'm gonna have my own fucking hair, right?  Yeah.  We like your own hair.  I actually like your real hair better.  Oh, thank you very much. 
[03:39:30]  I do.  I think you look better without your weight.  Thank you very much.  How come Duffy's not giving you any cock in the face?  I don't know.  See, he's all talk.  All talk, no action.  He probably has a small Irish dick.  I bet you he does.  Like a fucking baby thumb.  Small Irish dick.  Pat, please.  Okay, let's go.  Pat, man.  Pat, give her a lip a slap.  Be a goose.  Oh, Jesus.  I need a shower.  Hear a thing.  Give that to Sandy.  Hold on.  Take, um...  This is to take the dick.  There.  Oh, great.  More money to take the dick.  There you go. 
[03:40:00]  That'll pay for some things.  Thank you.  Is that from you?  Yeah, that'll pay for maybe to get something cleaned on you.  Yeah, a therapist after this.  A battered woman's shelter.  Not really.  I need a lot of time.  I do.  I need a battered woman's shelter.  Oh, God.  Danny just comes in and throws paper towels at her.  I'm in here getting a...  Well, it's yogurt and hot sauce.  It's not exactly gasoline that matches.  Yeah.  Bring on the gasoline and matches.  Next.  That's next.  I hope he'll do that next.  I hear a lot of chatter. 
[03:40:30]  Hi, man.  That's good radio.  To take you inside the show, we did debate setting her hair on fire.  It smells.  And we voted against that.  Yeah.  At the last second, because we didn't have a fire extinguisher nearby.  So.  And there's a merger happening.  We can't set people on fire.  Yeah.  Showing some responsibility today.  It was homestyle gravy, roasted turkey, that Iraq dumped on you.  Good stuff.  It was just gravy.  Just gravy.  And believe me, that was a big deal.  That was his fucking drink.  Yeah.  Nothing?  I need any shallots. 
[03:41:00]  Alright, thanks.  Alright, Pat, Duffy, take your dick out and slap it on her face.  That's right.  Don't be shy, Duff.  Let's see that fucking...  Do you mind adding hot sauce on your dick?  That's right.  Fluff it up a little.  I know.  I was pulling the whole break.  It just seems to have recessed as well.  It's very shy.  It is.  It's like a fucking scared turtle.  It really is.  I got nothing here.  Oh, who cares?  It could be worse.  Let's see it.  No.  We're all gonna look at your cots.  Don't be shy.  No one cares.  Oh, no.  It's gonna be nothing, right?  Just really nothing?  The guy with 8.5 cut is looking at you and fucking scowling. 
[03:41:30]  I know.  Why don't you step up?  You fucking...  Hey!  Work it a little.  Pat, work it a little.  You might not have the dick, but you have the balls.  Oh, thanks.  Okay.  So put the balls over her nose.  Don't be shy.  She could have meatballs with the gravy.  Did you hear that?  She was like, pull it out and make something of it.  Yeah, just look at the pretty girl back there and just look at her in fluff.  Just fluff in your shorts.  No, that's not gonna work unless it's covered in blood. 
[03:42:00]  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  That's pretty good.  That's funny.  See?  See?  Pat, this is not a size competition.  No one cares.  Take your dick out, we'll get another laugh.  Good time.  See when we got the mic over here.  Danny's standing there with a penthouse now or some porno.  Yeah, she's been so hot.  Trying to get him going.  I need another word.  Alright.  Alright, let's go, Sandy Kay.  Alright, alright.  Yeah.  Sandy, fluff him up a little bit.  Why don't you let Sandy stick her hand in there?  No dick, man.  I should've brought my vibrator. 
[03:42:30]  Pat Duffy just said, I need two seconds.  He went to get some.  He's probably gonna tug it like a fucking, like he's pumping oil.  He needs a pump.  Let's take this time to announce that Anthony got his computer overnight after that rant yesterday.  Yeah, if you remember from yesterday, I had quite a tirade at an email that was received  that said that, no, we'll get him his computer on our fucking time.  We're not gonna be threatened or anything like that.  Well, I went off and I want to thank whoever it was that listened and sent over today 
[03:43:00]  a brand new computer for me.  Wow.  For PalTalk and everything else.  The rich get richer.  Mars.  Yeah, that's right, that's right.  No, it's not for me, you douche.  Hold on.  It's not for me, it's for the fucking, for the studio.  Well, I'm just saying.  You're right though.  Yeah, yeah.  Thank you, Jim.  Thank you, Jim.  I can use a computer.  Maybe someone will send it over.  Oh, you need one for.  All the rich can do is ask if they get more, right? 
[03:43:30]  Yeah, yeah, right.  The rich get richer.  Alright, Pat Duffy, where'd you go?  Pat Duffy goes, I need two.  Oh, okay.  Here we go.  Alright, good.  He got it a little hard maybe.  Hope he went to a warmer room.  Oh, I see.  He was jerking off me.  Alright.  Here we go.  Get it all set.  Pat, you have your back to us at the 50 Guys.  Here we go.  What the fuck are you doing?  He's getting ready, that's all.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Jesus.  He's beating her.  Alright, alright.  Oh, fuck.  Jesus Christ. 
[03:44:00]  He's got a fucking one foot long rubber dick that he beat her in the face with.  That was close to assault.  Now we might have gone too far.  Oh, why would you do that to Sandy?  Yes.  Where is the real thing, Pat?  I love her.  She's just...  For like a split second though, I was going, wow, what did he do back there?  Get over here.  I don't want to do it for real.  I don't want to do it for real.  Why not?  Because you have a small dick, right?  Oh! 
[03:44:30]  Oh!  Face.  Oh, boy.  Face.  So it's true what they say about Irish guys, that they have small dicks.  Yeah.  Covered it.  Shut up.  Why not?  Alright.  Because if it was big, you probably would.  Hey, Jim did it, man.  He had a nice dick.  What about you?  Come on, man.  What happened?  It looks like shit on this side, by the way.  It looks like she's leaking shit on this side. 
[03:45:00]  She fucking has diarrhea.  She's sitting in a pool of gravy.  Yeah, she's sitting in just a mess.  I'll never forget this.  Can I take this home now?  Yes.  Yes.  You can have that, Pat.  Can I take this home?  Yes.  The master in the face of a double dung dildo.  Is this a tip for my garter, or what?  Why don't we carry her out of the studio?  What's wrong with these queers?  I don't know what happened, Jimmy.  I don't know what happened.  Oh, God.  Alright, let's just... 
[03:45:30]  Hey, Pat Duffy, let's carry her out of the studio.  Just carry the whole chair out.  Ladies and gentlemen, Sandy Kane leaving the studio.  Another fine appearance by Sandy Kane.  Who's the new naked cowgirl.  Oh, fuck.  46 in Broadway.  They just threw her in the chair after they left the studio.  Oh, my God, dude.  That was like an airplane crash landing.  They threw the chair with her in it. 
[03:46:00]  Someone shit in the hat.  Is she alright?  Sandy Kane, you alright?  She broke her spine.  Anyone have to shit?  Yeah, someone shit in her hat.  Who's gotta take a dump?  I was just trying.  I don't think I had anything.  I could probably take a leak in it.  No, we need shit.  It's very expensive, that hat.  Please, give me my fucking hat.  Johnny Fairplay, what do you got?  Hey.  No, where's my hat?  Huh?  Is my hat around?  I need to get shit in it.  You can put shit on it? 
[03:46:30]  My head is...  Go in the back here.  No, right here.  Go in the office.  No, no, right.  It has to kind of...  Over there or something.  Is my hat around?  Yeah, the hat's okay.  Yeah, the hat's okay.  Who cares?  We've done it before.  Yeah.  We're professionals.  We're professionals here.  If you do it in the bathroom, it doesn't really work.  Don't put it on when you're done, though.  He left the studio.  That's not as good.  Fair play.  Why is he still a shit?  Maybe he can.  Why is he getting shy?  Where?  Where at?  Just kind of like...  I don't know.  My fan. 
[03:47:00]  Who cares?  Oh my God.  It's gonna stink in here.  Just hold his bag for him.  Alright.  I, uh...  Oh no!  Oh no!  I...  Oh no!  I...  Nice.  I direct your attention to the court.  I can hear it from here.  Johnny Fairclay is sitting.  It's sitting in Kay's hat.  What?  What?  What?  There's a little.  Come on!  There's a little, Johnny.  He's...  He's trying.  I got a nugget.  He's trying.  I got enough.  I need toilet paper now. 
[03:47:30]  Oh God.  Can someone hand him some paper, please?  Oh God.  How bad is it?  How bad is it?  How bad is it?  Don't...  Oh!  How bad is it?  Jimmy, take...  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  What the fuck?  You have like fucking diarrhea!  What the fuck?  What do you...  What do you eat for lunch?  One piece of rice?  Oh my God!  Oh my God!  Oh my God!  Oh my God!  Oh my God!  Oh my God! 
[03:48:00]  Oh my God!  Oh my God!  Oh!  Oh my God!  Oh my God!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  She dumped the little teeny log out.  Hey that was good radio.  This is the most horrific thing I've ever seen.  This is the horrific thing I've ever seen.  I can't deal with it.  I can smell it, but I didn't see it.  It was like chocolate rice.  Only on the Opie and Anthony show.  And she dumped it.  That's when XM was created.  Shit in her hat. 
[03:48:30]  Johnny Fairplay shit in her hat.  And it started leaking out  because it's like a straw mesh hat.  Nice cancer dumpster.  It started leaking out.  And now it's in there.  Wait, let me be on Survivor.  Was it Survivor or what?  Sandy, how much to put the hat on?  I'll give you how much to put it on.  100 bucks to wear the hat?  20, 40, 60, 80, 100.  It'll be the fucking smartest thing  that's been under that hat in a long time.  20, 40, 60, 80, 100. 
[03:49:00]  Put the hat on.  The 100 bucks.  Not in my seat!  There was a shitty comic there.  Another shitty comic there.  Oh my god.  Another shitty comic.  Put it on.  Put it on.  Yeah, put that hat on and wear it proudly.  Oh, don't be sensitive.  The hat feels the same way, believe me.  Put the taco and eat it.  Put it on, pull it down.  There you go. 
[03:49:30]  $20.  And Danny mushed the hat down in her head.  This is so fucking disgusting.  She smells like gravy.  She's wearing exactly the shit on it.  She has no wig.  The guitar string's got cut.  I can't take this.  I am disgusted with us.  She was all proud of her new gig and look what we did to her.  She's now got her real hair on.  She's got a shit hat on her head.  She looks better with her real hair, by the way. 
[03:50:00]  Pussy hairs hanging out the side.  Look at that.  I know.  She likes to grow in a little bit there, Johnny.  I'm more concerned about Johnny Fairplay.  I think he's got to announce that he has cancer.  Might as well announce it on our show.  Something's going on there.  You want to take that shit and put it on a worm, you'll catch a trout.  Who's shit in the hat?  Who's shit in the hat?  I think it was Opie.  No, I didn't shit in your hat.  Who was it?  Johnny Fairplay, he's a big star, this guy.  At least you got shit from a celebrity. 
[03:50:30]  You got celebrity shit in your hat.  To be honest with you, it was so small.  It's like a wimp shit.  That's not like a big shit.  That's a challenge.  A man shit.  That's not a man shit, right?  It was small, man.  What are you, a little baby?  Are you challenging?  You're not challenging us.  I expect my man to take a big shit.  You know?  Not really.  That was so tiny.  We're talking about the hat, not your mouth.  Oh, wow.  What'd you say?  Wow, face.  I don't know.  Okay, no.  He's shitting my hat, but it was so wimpy.  Go shitting your hat.  I'm just saying.  You must have a small dick because the shit was small. 
[03:51:00]  You'll never know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ever.  He had a baby, so, yeah.  Ooh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, don't worry.  That smell will go away when you leave.  You're like a man with a big shit, though, right?  Yeah.  Hey, a healthy fucking shit.  Not like that.  Right.  It was not only that thick, but it was real skinny, man. 
[03:51:30]  It's small.  What spilled out of it, though?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I think it was the gravy from the-  Oh, some gravy.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Wow.  I thought it was your shit.  That was a tiny little log, though, right?  Yeah, it was, really.  I expected something big.  Yeah.  A man-sized shit.  Don't challenge us.  Nah, I'm just-  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Where's Danny?  Danny fucking Danny?  That's the DJ radio.  Where's Danny?  Where is Danny?  More money.  We'll get you more money, but where's Danny? 
[03:52:00]  Where's Danny and his fucking-  You always take fucking horrendous dumps.  I know.  I usually do have big giant logs, but I don't know.  If I had one, I'd love to get it out for you.  He writes his name in the snow and shit.  We got some egg flacks here.  Eh, eh.  Yeah, what a little teeny shit that one.  Tell him, Sandy.  That is like skinny, baby.  You better go wash off or something.  What, did he just eat pussy? Is that it?  She's got to do what, though, to get into the bathroom?  Because, you know, the rules. 
[03:52:30]  We've got to throw something over.  Yeah, we've got to get something on you.  How about a coffin lid?  He wants to wash me.  Bring your mics in.  You did that with Robert Kelly once.  Yeah, we're not allowed to do that anymore.  Wash my pussy.  Why don't we get Sandy King out of the studio?  Bye, Sandy.  Good job.  Bye there, Sandy.  That was work.  Godspeed.  Good job.  Home safe.  Careful.  There she goes.  And there goes Sandy King.  Stalker Patty, you having fun out there or what? 
[03:53:00]  Stalker Patty, you having fun?  I am so fucking disgusted.  I got a rod.  You would.  That was pretty good on cue, right?  Yeah, I mean, fuck.  You know, being able to squeeze out a little bit, that's fine.  Yeah.  Sandy, and then she put the hat on for $100.  You see how her eyes lit up with that $100?  It's actually a tax write-off for me.  Yeah, it is.  What's this?  I gave a girl $100 to put a shit habit in her head. 
[03:53:30]  I'm going to allow you to deduct that.  That's an actual legal tax deduction.  It certainly is.  I believe it is.  Hey, one of the audience members, no one at their job knows that this person is a burlesque performer.  Sandy King.  Someone in the audience is a burlesque performer and no one at work knows.  The girl on the Clover shirt.  Which one do you think?  I think the black shirt. 
[03:54:00]  The second one in?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's me.  Well, wow.  She was the only possibility.  Look at her.  Wait, there's another girl there.  What are you saying, John?  What are you saying?  Well, I don't think any of those dudes are.  There's another girl there.  There's more girls in the audience.  Not that I'd pay to see.  Oh, no.  Nothing wrong with it.  But what about the girl on the end?  Hold on, that's very hurtful.  Who's the girl on the end?  I'm Nicole.  Hi, Nicole.  That wasn't very nice, right?  That's okay.  It's cool. 
[03:54:30]  Yeah, see?  Well, you're hurt, though?  It's okay.  No, not at all.  All right.  It should be.  So what do your burlesque thing entail?  What do you do?  We put on a show two times a year.  We do choreographed dance and find creative ways to take our clothes off.  How naked do you get?  Panties and pasties.  Panties and pasties.  Would you dance for us?  I'd love to see you dance.  If you can dance, I can't dance for shit.  I didn't bring any pasties. 
[03:55:00]  You don't have to.  You don't have to.  How about a panties and a bra?  Bra and panties.  Yeah, we would love to end the week of radio.  That'd be sexy.  And Michelle would like to sit down and you do it for her.  With a little bit of sexy instead of the disgusting display we just had.  Yeah, we got a 70-year-old woman with duty in her hat.  We'd like to cleanse the palace.  Yeah, we don't want that to be the last thing people remember from this week of radio.  We got the nice music, too.  The old school burlesque music and everything.  Um, come on.  We'll be fine.  We'll be really pretty. 
[03:55:30]  Sure, okay.  All right.  All right.  Go to the prize closet.  Let's get something.  That's nice.  I think it's just build up.  There was no shit on there, didn't there?  No, it was gravy.  All right.  Jimmy, you can't sit down anymore.  There was shit on your seat.  No, Sam said it was gravy.  I've been gassed in that seat all day.  It just stinks.  All right.  All right, here we go.  It's gravy.  Michelle's pretty happy at this point.  Yeah, I'm glad you'd be here for this, Sam.  Michelle, this will turn you on, Michelle? 
[03:56:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, come on.  I have a girl dancing for me.  Absolutely.  Right on.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  A little burlesque.  Bro, I've...  Is Michelle allowed to touch?  Is that okay?  Girl's gonna, uh...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's got a little reddish hair.  She has a three fingers only roll-up.  One.  Michelle's got the shocker.  Irish girl.

Lucy St. James.  Hey, would you still like to make out with Michelle before you put your shirt back on?  How come we can't see your ass?  Just the kiss on the cheek.  How about...  No, just to make out.  All right, yeah, let's turn off the music.  How about I put the burlesque music back on?  I want to see your ass.  I didn't play this.  I'm so ass.  Don't punish me.  Exactly.

We didn't hear from Stalker Patty today.  Patty, you have fun?  Yeah, Patty.  How you doing?  Hi.  How you doing?  Long time.  It's my first day off in about a week, so. 
[04:03:30]  Okay.  First day off in about a week.  That's strange.  Yeah.  I'm working a lot of balance lately.  Wow.  It's back.  It's back.  Sandy Kay, what?  Shit.  I just want to say one thing about Stalker Patty.  I live in a building where she works at Starbucks.  Now, that girl is there every day.  And she is a big mentor to me.  She works her ass off.  Mentor?  And a lot of people recognize her voice because they say, oh, you're an Opie and Anthony.  And I just want to say, thank you, Stalker Patty.  You're a big inspiration to me. 
[04:04:00]  You work your ass off.  How bad is your life?  Wow.  Yeah, exactly.  When she's your inspiration.  I'm more inspired by the thing that was in your hat.  No offense, Patty.  Yeah, exactly.  Compare it to little shit.  Patty had a weird story.  She is the shit beneath my hat.  I was waiting on a line of customers.  She just said I was three.  Let's keep talking on the laugh.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  Some guy wanted a coffee.  We didn't hear you because we were all laughing.  Start over.  I was waiting on a line of customers and some guy wanted two shots in his coffee. 
[04:04:30]  So I said I have a black guy here and he thought I was talking about him.  Well, a black guy is two shots in your coffee.  What kind of racist fucking dribble is coming out?  I understand all racism.  I'll have a medium iced latte.  He'd like a jig, please.  What the hell do you mean? 
[04:05:00]  What do you mean?  Shots in your coffee is called a red eye, not a black eye.  No, one shot is a red eye.  Two shots is a black eye.  And three shots is a bloody eye.  A black eye.  Black eye.  So you thought I was talking about him.  Then what happened?  Well, he happened to be a person of a different race.  So you said black guy.  Yeah, that's what he thought I said.  Oh.  Oh.  That coffee humor.  I miss it every time.  It was kind of funny. 
[04:05:30]  Everyone chuckled.  Everyone chuckled.  When he punched you in the face, knocked your hat off.  He was innocent.  Oh, God.  That's wonderful, Patty.  Thanks for that story.  Well, you said spider-up.  Yeah.  FTD.com.  Thank you for sponsoring Line of the Day.  Promo code XM if you're going to get that deal I mentioned a little while ago.  Here is a runner-up Line of the Day.  They were two strangers.  I'm not usually this much fun.  Ew. 
[04:06:00]  Ew.  I would only like that if she was laying under five guys in a circle and had a cracker on her face.  Very nice.  To the next one?  You try to say unsexy things around him.  Oh, how's my girl?  Constipated.  See, they're not laughing because it's out of context.  Yeah, I know.  Completely.  That's the beauty of this bit.  Yeah.  Linger.  We just do this to make ourselves feel better. 
[04:06:30]  Like we actually did something fun.  Another runner-up Line of the Day.  Oh.  You know what?  You got to like break out some dollar bills there, my friend.  I think he's done that.  Because we're getting...  At least he's with her.  That was fun.  Everybody talking to Imus.  Yeah.  Did you enjoy your time with Imus, Jimmy?  Yeah, it was nice.  Before you sat in the front seat.  I was just sitting back there.  Don?  Don?

Who's a black comic?  He's at Stand Up New York all the time.  Byron Allen? 
[04:08:00]  He has a new TV show, MTV.  And he knows about your TV show, guys.  What was it?  Yeah.  Right, right.  All right.  All right.  Let's thank us.  I forgot his name.

[04:09:00]  Oh, he took scissors and cut the fucking strings.  I ruined things.  Steve.  Very nice.  That was fucking hilarious.  Felice been here the whole time.  Of the guy at the show.  Oh, let me see that picture, Sandy.  Jim will know.  What is it?  Let me see the picture.  I'll tell you what it is.  Oh, yeah.  It's a new TV show, MTV2.  It's too obvious.  I'm just giving it to Jimmy.  So anyway, I sang my boyfriend's black to him.  Oh, no.  My boyfriend's black.  Oh, that's, um... 
[04:09:30]  That's, uh...  That's, uh...  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Luckily, I have another one.  He's a good friend of mine.  Who is it?

He has a brand new show.  It's Dono Rollins.  He premieres on MTV2, and he came out to Broadway and 46th Street, and we did shows together. 
[04:10:00]  What kind of show is it?  And he told me he had a big dick.  And he asked me, did I ever have sex with a black man?  Sandy.  What?  You're all over the place.  Okay.  It's, um...  He knew about your show, too.  Yes, I know.  He's a friend of mine.  He's on the wire.  Jimmy, do you blame her at this point?  What's his name?  She's frazzled.  I know he's black.  I could destroy her.  I knew he was black and bald.  All right.  What's it about?  I don't know.  He just came out and interviewed me, and the cameras were out there, and I said...  You sure he's not on the animal planet?  My boyfriend's black, I did, with him. 
[04:10:30]  Oh, the magic that must have ensued.  Oh, right, man.  And he didn't take his dick out.  But he asked me if I ever had sex with a black man, and I said, yes.  He said, was it big?  I said, yes.  He said, who was it?  And I said, DeMond Wilson from Sanford & Son.  You slept with DeMond Wilson from Sanford & Son?  He was just penis, man.  Really?  He was gorgeous.  I thought you said Pryor fucked you, too.  Oh, well, he raped me.  Why didn't you mention that?  DeMond Wilson, it was consensual.  She mentions Lamont and not Richard Pryor? 
[04:11:00]  That's why we love this thing.  Did he pink sock anister first?  Did he stick in your mouth?  He was hot.  Now he's a minister.  Why you fuck a dummy?  I'm going to stamp shit in your hat and make Gorilla Cooke.  All right.  Thank you, Sandy Cain, for the fifth time.  Thank you, Sandy Cain. 
[04:11:30]  What's his name, though, man?  What's the guy's name?  We said it already.  Oh, yeah, I know him.  I mix Sandy Cain and Ripple.  I call it Shitbull.  Shitbull.  All right, thank you, Sandy Cain.  Sandy!  Oh, God.  Why?  Oh, no, she's back.  I want a black dildo next time.  Beat me with a black one.  All right, we'll beat you with a black dildo next time.  She took a beating today.  She's all right.  She really did take a beating. 
[04:12:00]  They threw her and the chair out of the studio.  That was like one of those fucking plane crash tests  where they drop the airplane chair with a dummy in it.  Well...  That was a lounge chair.  You guys have fun.  All right, another successful live program here.  And Flea was here the whole time.  We didn't even have to talk to him.  Thank you, God.  Thank God.  Thank God.  Old piss feet.  He pisses on his feet to keep him soft in the shower.  That's what he says. 
[04:12:30]  And they're yellow.  His feet are yellow.  Want your face to be soft?  He pisses on his feet.  Oh, don't give him a mic.  No, let's hear what he has to say.  He has nothing to say.  Good point.  Flea, what do you got?  No, pissing on your feet is definitely a good thing.  Bro.  That's great.  Pissing on your feet is a good thing.  That's actually you.  I thought that was supposed to be that.  And Dr. Steve confirmed it.  And I'll see.  The time's a wasted goal.  So where you going till tomorrow when I see. 
[04:13:00]  That's Flea Man on a voicemail.  That's Flea singing songs.  That's wonderful.  You sing songs on people's voicemails.  I don't know who I left that for.  What was that?  Who's still inducing?  Oh, I know who it is now.  Never mind.  We can go through the park and have to talk.  Smoke that cup of weed.  At the marijuana burn, we can take our turn.  Singing them dirty rap songs.  Stop and hit the bone like Cheech and Chong. 
[04:13:30]  Lisa, I hate you.  I'm here to Hong Kong.  So I'll roll to 83.  I gotta like Coopsterville.  Cause if my tapes and my CDs just don't sell, I bet my cabbie will.  What song is that?  Crazy Rap by Afro Man.  Who are you singing it to?  Uh...  In the mouth of God.  Nice shot, Duffy.  Pat Duffy just picked up Sandy Cain's panties or whatever the fuck they were. 
[04:14:00]  Hit Flea in the mouth with them.  Threw it right in Flea's face.  It hit him in the mouth.  Oh God.  Do you know there was shit on that?  Flea, who are you singing to?  My friend Marissa.  Cause you really can sing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, Flea, is it true you try to become a model?  Uh, yes.  I...  For what?  I...  I wanted to go for modeling. 
[04:14:30]  After I was finished with Accutane, I felt that my skin was better.  And I tried to maybe make some money on the side by trying to get a modeling gig going.  And I was told that I was too short and too round short.  And ugly.  You're too ugly.  Ha.  Ha.  You're not...  How polite are they?  Well, you're a little short.  Yeah.  You're a fucking asshole.  I was short.  Well, your ankles are too thick.  Is it true also you ask people to come up to you while you're talking to girls at events  so you look famous?  What? 
[04:15:00]  What the hell is that?  No, I...  No, no.  Let's say you go up to a girl and you're talking to her.  Then you ask your friends to come up and...  And go, hey, you're Flea.  Hey, aren't you Flea?  I've heard you on Ron and Fez or something.  Yeah.  And it's supposed to impress the girls.  Wait, Flea, can we...  That's true?  Uh, yeah.  It's kind of a good move.  It was true.  It was true.  It was true.  Can we see your model face?  You have to make a model face.  Don't be shy.  Magnum?  I...  The one picture that I did, I was up against a wall.  So I'd have to... 
[04:15:30]  Oh, that's...  Because then the wall won.  Up against the wall.  Take your glasses off, right?  It's a lineup.  Yeah.  Glasses come off.  All right, he's doing his model pose.  By the way, this is on the show, so don't expect too much from this part of the show.  Now he's...  Oh, God.  Oh, what a total douchebag.  Do we have a picture of that?  Better.  It's actually not that bad.  Take a picture of him. 
[04:16:00]  Take a picture of him being a model.  Hold on.  I'll get a picture of Flea.  That's fucking funny, Flea.  Hold on.  I don't know if you're going for funny, but that's fucking funny.  No, it's good.  And his hands in pockets.  It looks like he's studied modeling because...  He's trying to do like a GQ thing.  You've seen this pose a million times.  Where's another jar of gravy?  Steve was leaning against the door, and Steve just pushed the door open, and Flea flew. 
[04:16:30]  Right.  You don't do it.  Let's do it.  Come on.  I want a picture of you.  Don't be paranoid, Steve.  I want a picture of you.  Focus.  You've got to be able to focus when you're a model, no matter what the circumstance or conditions.  America's Next Top Model, they put you in weird situations, and you have to deal with it.  How's he doing?  Michelle, is that good?  It's actually not bad.  That would be a perfect shot.  Gayforpay.com.  Gayforpay.com, right?  I love it.  Beautiful.  Is that a real website?  How does she know about gay websites there, Johnny Fairfoot? 
[04:17:00]  I'm on the road a lot.  Michelle, why do you know about GayforPay?  Is that a real website?  I don't know.  John told me about it.  That's weird, right?  What song can you sing, for real?  You can sing.  Give a voice.  Yeah, you're going to sing a song out of here in a second, but there's one more thing.  He also tried to get a girl back to his car by asking if she wanted to see his GPS.  Is that true, too, Flea?  Jesus.  Who is she, from fucking Zimbabwe? 
[04:17:30]  Jersey?  I'm never telling my friends anything.  What happened?  You said you wanted to see my GPS, and you figured you'd make a move?  I met somebody through a dating service, and we went out to dinner.  And I learned that a good way to get somebody to your car is probably to show them a piece  of technology or get them to listen to music or something.  So, I load Deftones in the car, and then I have a GPS system.  I'm like, oh, do you?  Wow.  AshleyMadison.com pays through once again. 
[04:18:00]  And I found out.  I said, oh, I got a GPS in my car, so would you like to see it?  What'd she say?  Well, no, but we don't.  But did you at least talk about some of the features?  What's the name of the website that you went to to fucking get this girl?  I mean, that's a brilliant move.  That's not creepy at all.  I have an iPod.  You want to sit in the empty parking lot and look at us?  No, but it's technically being nice and inviting. 
[04:18:30]  You know, if you talk about technology, you say, oh, I got a GPS.  Do you want to come, you know, see mine?  It's actually smoother to say, I have to shit.  Can I borrow your scarf?  I have parachute cord and duct tape.  That's the worst fucking pickup line I've ever heard.  It's not a pickup line.  It's making conversation.  It's an awful conversation.  Have you ever heard of Neil Strauss?  No.  Oh, okay.  I was just saying it wrong.  Who is he?  How is it said?  I don't know.  Jim, you know who he is.  It's Neil Strauss.  Yes, he wrote Fuckin' the Game.  Yeah.  Yes. 
[04:19:00]  I read that, so I'm going to say it.  I don't know how to say his name.  I forgot.  Neil Strauss?  I don't know.  Maybe you fucked up, but you said you want to come look at my guppa-esque.  Fucking dumpster.  All right, Pauline, what song could you sing for us?  We got to leave.  I could do Never Gonna Give You Up.  That's a good song.  All right.  Chicks like that shit.  All right, we're going to leave you with flea singing today.  Something bad is always going to happen.  No.  I'm terrible.  You think?  Fucking flea is a... 
[04:19:30]  I got a bunch of...  You got your fucking...  A bunch of...  Like, what did you say?  Oh, what was the term?  A bunch of hooks in the water?  It was the term you used to?  Yeah, sure.  That's what he's got with the fucking singing, the picking chicks up, the mot...  Something's going to break for you.  Yeah.  Hopefully, it'll be your neck and spine.  Oh, shit.  Swim walk, motherfuckers.  Okay.  All right, flea.  The show is yours.  We leave with flea today.  I don't know.  I'm terrified.  I'm afraid something's going to happen.  No, we promise you.  No one's going to assault you.  Just sing.  Nothing we can do is worse than what we're just going to hear. 
[04:20:00]  Okay, just start.  Sing!  Okay.  We're no strangers to love.  You know the rules, and so do I.  A full commitment's what I'm thinking of.  You wouldn't get this from any other guy.  I just want to tell you how I'm feeling.  Gotta make you understand.  Never gonna give you up.  Never gonna let you down. 
[04:20:30]  Never gonna run around and desert you.  I'm never gonna make you cry.  Never gonna say goodbye.  Never gonna tell.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  Wow.  No one's really applauding or anything.  And that's how we wrap up.  Yeah, that's it.  Not bad.  Yeah, well.  Tell me no music or anything. 
[04:21:00]  You didn't get to warm up the pipes.  Much appreciated.  All right.  We'll see you guys Monday.  Have a good weekend.  We got someone not happy.  Lisa, Long Island, what's up?  Maybe we could talk this out.  Humor is in the worst, the worst taste I have ever heard.  I can't believe the choice of humor.  The worst.  Do you think that's funny?  Yes.  Do you think that's intelligent?  Make a pie, bud.  Make a pie.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show. </pre>
