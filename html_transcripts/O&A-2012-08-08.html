<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Sam Roberts recounting a supposedly true story about his father’s encounter with Colonel Sanders in Australia, where Sanders allegedly expressed support for the White Australia Policy using offensive racial slurs. This sparked a discussion about racial stereotypes associated with fried chicken and the hosts’ preferences for various chicken parts.  Sam was hesitant to fully detail his father's story, citing potential repercussions.

The conversation quickly shifted to the London Olympics.  The hosts discussed various events, including Allie Reisman's gold medal win (and her father's crude comment about it), a German diver's disastrous performance, and the women's beach volleyball, commenting on the attractiveness of the American and Chinese players.  They heavily mocked their producer, "confident E-Rock," for his perceived lack of composure, repeatedly using the phrase "come back here and shut up" as a running gag throughout the rest of the show.  Their analysis of a cycling race further highlighted their confusion about the racers' strategies.  Callers Greg (New Hampshire) and Joe (New Jersey) joined the discussion, offering their perspectives on drafting techniques in indoor track cycling.  This led to a humorous debate about the various ways athletes could die during the Olympics, both Summer and Winter.

The show then transitioned to personal anecdotes about childhood bullying and social dynamics. A call from Wayne, who worked with the band The Toadies, led to a segment featuring their music and a discussion of the band's history, including a former member's departure due to marriage.  A significant portion of the show played clips from a past Philadelphia broadcast featuring an "oddest thing you own" contest. These clips detailed shocking and outrageous entries, including a man's interaction with a dead monkey, listeners presenting body parts, and a woman performing oral sex in public with her child present. The hosts compared their past, more unrestrained style to the limitations of their current satellite radio platform and FCC regulations.  They promoted their upcoming Chicago live broadcast and encouraged listeners to participate in a similar contest.  They also discussed Chris Rock's new movie and Opie's failed joke introducing Kid Rock at a concert.

A substantial pre-show production issue concerning the Chicago live broadcast dominated a later segment.  A miscommunication regarding staff travel arrangements, particularly Sam Roberts' arrival time, caused significant tension. Jimmy, Anthony, Opie, producers Travis and Kenny, and Gary (a seemingly higher-up in management) engaged in a heated debate, exchanging accusations of miscommunication, poor planning, and potentially lying.  Budget constraints and the possibility of staff sharing hotel rooms were also discussed.  The potential consequences of Sam missing his pre-show segment due to flight delays at O'Hare were repeatedly emphasized.  The discussion also touched on Chris Rock (promoting his movie "Two Days in New York"), Dr. Drew, and an Elton John/Madonna feud.  Eventually, a solution was reached regarding Sam's flight, and the segment concluded with promotion of the Chicago live show.

The final segment featured a movie discussion, including negative and positive reviews of various films.  This transitioned into a discussion of the Elton John/Madonna feud, including speculation about Lady Gaga copying Madonna's music.  Chris Rock then appeared in studio.  Much of the remaining time focused on his new movie, *Two Days in New York*, his stand-up career, and his opinions on the New York Knicks, particularly Jeremy Lin's departure.  Jim Norton's 40-day porn abstinence and its effects were discussed, followed by a discussion of Rock's experiences producing a show for FX.  The show concluded with final comments about Chris Rock's movie and the hosts' reflections on the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, God. It's also good advice.  Can we tell that on the air?  I would.  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  It's an alleged story.  No, you didn't come in in the middle of the program. 
[00:00:30]  We do start the festivities a bit early.  Yeah, and the mics go on, and we're right in the middle of yapping to each other.  Sam had a humorous anecdote about his father and Colonel Sanders.  I didn't know. Your dad was in Australia at the time?  Yeah, because he lived there for a while with my mom.  Oh, good eye.  Yes.  And he met Colonel Sanders down there, down under.  Yeah, in Adelaide, I think.  And what happened? They were opening a new Kentucky Fried Chicken or something?  It must have been an advertising thing. I'm sure my dad was maybe heading up some kind of campaign. 
[00:01:00]  Was your dad one of the madmen?  Oh, yeah, he was.  He was a madman.  He was a big-time madman.  An international guy.  Was it the original Colonel Sanders?  Yeah, it was the guy. The real guy.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, because I don't think they replaced Colonel Sanders after that.  They didn't, like, have a franchise like Ronald McDonald or anything.  They had another guy that kind of walked around, though.  I don't think they put him in commercials, though.  Not in commercials or anything.  I'm not even sure.  I think Colonel Sanders was pretty adamant about, hey, I'm the one guy.  Fuck that.  I'm not putting this suit around.  I think they found another guy. 
[00:01:30]  The old plantation owner? Really?  But I don't think they had him front and center, like, in commercials and stuff.  I don't know.  I'm going to challenge you on that, sir.  I am going to stick to my guns and say no one else donned the old plantation owner fucking look  and took the reins of representing Kentucky Fried Chicken.  Kentucky Fried Chicken proves that, oh, God.  You get scared.  The blacks love fried chicken, because why would you deal with this?  It's true.  It's like, wow, why would you deal with the old southern plantation owner guy, the colonel? 
[00:02:00]  Yes.  The symbol of Kentucky Fried Chicken is the plantation owner.  That's everything bad.  Is that why the other fried chicken places popped up, you think?  They finally had it?  Yeah.  As a society and said, look, we can't give our money to the old plantation owner.  Like Popeye, you mean?  That's what I'm thinking.  Maybe.  Maybe they finally were like, no, we can't do this anymore.  It really is like the Jews going to Hitler's Fried Chicken.  You know?  It just seems like it's... 
[00:02:30]  Why would you do that?  I think the blacks do get a bad rap about fried chicken, because the fact is, we all  love fried chicken.  So why is it that we focus on black people liking fried chicken?  Yeah.  I can't think of one person in my life, the people I hang with, that don't like fried chicken.  Everyone likes fried chicken.  It's fucking great.  Every single person likes it.  So why do they get the bad rap with that?  Yeah.  Why?  Anyone know?  I don't know.  I guess from the old days. 
[00:03:00]  The old days, that used to be what?  Yeah.  A cheap meal or something?  Yeah.  I think in the old days, you just didn't eat chicken?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I love...  I don't eat fried chicken ever, but it's fucking good.  I don't either.  Oh, God.  I eat it every once in a while.  I would love a piece.  I would love fried chicken.  Here we go.  We do this every time.  Here we go.  Why do we do this all the time?  I don't get to eat it, though.  I might eat one piece every six months.  It's so good.  Let's get a bucket.  We should get a bucket.  We should get a bucket.  It has to be...  Get your bucket on? 
[00:03:30]  Let's get a bucket on, yo.  It has to be white meat.  Regular has to be white meat.  Yeah?  Original recipe?  Oh, yeah.  It has to be...  I don't mind a little leg every so often.  Oh, I love a leg.  Why eat a leg when you can eat a breast?  Because, uh...  Wait, a breast's not...  Wait, a leg's not white meat?  They're sort of white meat.  Oh, boy.  No, that's considered, like, darker meat.  Oh, I like a leg, too.  I like a mixture.  I like a mixture.  I think it's more of a mixture, right?  Let's get a mixture.  Let's get both...  You know, you've got to have a leg.  When does K...  And a wing. 
[00:04:00]  When does KFC open?  How about a wing?  When does KFC open?  Probably 10.  This is all I'm going to be thinking about now.  I know.  It's eating poorly.  I really do enjoy a good...  Look at that.  They just cut it.  With some of that gravy and the mashed potatoes.  And we want old school.  None of that new shit they're trying.  Nothing new.  I want old fucking KFC shit.  We're children of the 80s.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  Sam, children of the 80s.  We go old school.  None of that new crap they've invented.  Yes.  Original recipe.  That's right. 
[00:04:30]  So what happened with Colonel Sanders and your father?  Now, what you're about to hear is an alleged story.  I think we have to say this.  Um, who's going to refute it?  Colonel Sanders is dead and it was just him and your dad, right?  Yeah, my dad was probably joking, though.  We'll just say that.  Ah, but he wasn't joking?  He could have been joking.  He could have been kidding around.  I want to see your dad on the witness stand.  Do you think he was kidding?  No, but he could have been. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, no.  See, we could just say alleged.  Right.  He could have been kidding.  No, that's stupid radio.  We keep it real here.  Yeah.  This is what your father said happened.  What happened in the men's room with Colonel Sanders?  Go ahead, Sam.  You were brave enough to tell us before the mics went live.  Yeah.  What do you mean brave enough?  I was telling a story to you guys.  Yeah, but that's boring.  Why tell a story if no one's listening?  Right.  You three were listening.  But we're not here to have cute little stories with each other.  We want to broadcast this shit to the masses. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  Yes.  That's our jobs.  Well, you don't seem very brave, then, because you're not telling the story, either.  I'm not telling the story because it's not my story.  Oh, okay.  That's fair.  I just said blacks like fried chicken.  I think I was pretty brave to start the show.  But then I defended them, saying, why do they get the bad rap, and no one has answered  that question yet, because we all love fried chicken.  I love fried chicken.  Exactly.  There might be other food groups that not everyone likes, but fried chicken, that's  safe to say most people like that.  Fantastical.  Go ahead, Sam. 
[00:06:00]  So what happened?  You, I mean, your dad, Colonel Sanders, in Australia, he's a madman.  Who is?  Your dad.  Yes.  And apparently Colonel Sanders.  Yeah, he's a lunatic.  What did Colonel Sanders say to your dad about, I guess, about Australia?  And just think of how hard you've worked to get here, Sam.  Oh, well, now I'm not going to say it.  Yeah, I don't think I'm going to say it.  You said the other day, you don't like this place.  I'm not talking about this place.  I'm talking about my future in the business.  Well, please. 
[00:06:30]  Exactly.  What future?  Future?  You think you're a shining star at 22.  Oh, shit.  Really?  I like Anthony's response better about the business being involved.  That's true.  Sam's like when you go to AAA Ball and you see that guy, and you're like, oh, God, I  thought he was going to make it to the majors.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  But he's still really good at AAA Ball, but.  I'll tell you something, of late, I've heard from a couple of people that are not in the  business that have discussed Sam and the after show and said Sam is very good. 
[00:07:00]  Hey, people are real.  No, but I mean, it's just not like us saying it or other people in the business.  It's just like people that just listen casually and like, Sam's very good with that thing.  I'm all in with Sam.  I've not heard that.  The listeners love you beat them up.  What are your reviews that you've heard?  I've heard.  I'm not saying that they haven't said that, but I've heard.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  We just love knocking everyone out, don't we?  Look at this.  It's getting exhausted.  I'm reading.  Come on, Anthony.  No one said that.  See? 
[00:07:30]  Lots of people say that.  No, it is kind of the word that Sam does a very good job on the after show.  It's entertaining.  It's entertaining, and we get to fool around with the people that you do the show with,  like E-Rock, which we're going to get to in a minute or two.  Oh, my God.  Yes, please.  And the listeners hating me has become grossly exaggerated, by the way.  Has it?  Oh, yes.  Tell the Colonel Sam story.  It's all right.  Look at that.  Yeah.  And before you do, just in case it's the last thing you ever say on the air, I want to  say that I enjoyed doing my Joe.  I don't think I'm going to tell it.  I enjoyed doing my Joe Walsh interview with Sam.  I could have done that on my head. 
[00:08:00]  I would rather do it with Sam, because he's a good interviewer.  And he has good questions.  I listened to that lunatic in you guys.  Joe Walsh is weird.  He's funny.  He's great.  Man.  Joe Walsh.  He did sound a little odd.  Technology.  Yeah.  He looks great, though.  He sounds like he sounded way older than he looks.  Than he looks.  He looks good.  He looks good.  He looks like Joe Walsh.  He looked exactly the same, because I saw him in the bathroom.  But that's because he looked weird and oldish years ago.  True.  His face is always crinkled like one of them apples that are drying on.  You carve a face into it and then dry it on the windowsill. 
[00:08:30]  We're very fortunate here.  We go to the bathroom.  The urinals are all lined up.  And every once in a while, you're just peeing next to a huge celebrity.  Celebrity piss time.  I love that.  And no one talks, because in the end, we're all men.  You just never know, though.  And you're like, holy fuck.  That's Joe Walsh.  She's peeing right next to me.  Meh.  Meh.  Anyway, Sam.  Go ahead.  Tell the story.  I just got word.  KFC opens at 9 a.m.  Nice.  That's perfect for us.  Right now.  I don't think I'm going to tell the story. 
[00:09:00]  Why not?  You have to.  That's probably not a good idea.  Because you also, you guys are terrible judges of when something is a good idea to do on  the air.  Why are you panicking?  You've learned so well.  I'm not panicking.  Why are you panicking?  You are panicking a little.  You're panicking.  Why are you panicking?  He's panicking.  Well, I'm not panicking, because I haven't said anything.  Because, how do you say Jim and I?  Jim and I.  Mm-hmm.  Why?  What does that mean?  Nothing.  Yeah, it means something, because you said mm-hmm.  Oh, I'm just saying mm-hmm. 
[00:09:30]  Why?  Say it again.  Jim and I.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Are you saying that it implies that Jim and Lady Diana are doing something the way he says  it?  Jim and I?  Jim and I?  Jim and I.  Oh, Jesus.  No, it sounds like fucking Mercury, in between Mercury and Apollo programs.  Gem and I.  Oh.  Gem and I.  Jim and I.  Jim.  Gem and I.  Gem and I.  Jim.  Gem and I.  That's getting made fun of by Jess yesterday, because she thinks I say Toronto wrong.  Oh, what?  No, you say Toronto. 
[00:10:00]  Toronto.  I think that's how I say it.  People say Toronto.  That's what she said it is, but I said no, there's a Toronto.  No one says Toronto.  No one says Toronto.  Oh, yeah, you don't pronounce that other two.  Yeah, I'm going to Toronto.  Toronto.  Yeah, no one says Toronto.  It's kind of like that badminton.  Badminton.  And then intaminenin.  Sometimes it's not worth, like, using all the letters in a word.  Yeah.  You just get to the end of the word.  Can you tell your story, please?  Yeah, so...  I don't think...  You've got a lot to do with it.  Your dad, he's in Madman and Adman, back in the day, back in the day. 
[00:10:30]  He's in Australia.  What year is it?  Circa?  Circa?  It was probably the 70s.  70s, when Australia had what was called the White Policy.  What did they have back then?  They had a White Policy.  What's that?  Yeah, yeah.  White Australia Policy.  What is that?  Look up White Australia Policy.  And let's learn a little about Australia.  White Australia Policy.  All right. 
[00:11:00]  Let's start.  The term White Australia Policy comprises various historical policies that intentionally restricted  non-white immigration to Australia.  From its origin...  From its origins at Federation in 1901, the policies were progressively dismantled between 1949 and 1973.  Oh, and when was your dad there?  It was in the 70s.  I don't know exactly.  All right, all right.  Well, I'm sure it carried over a little. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  The effects thereof were still going on, at the very least.  So your dad, Colonel Sanders, hanging out, Dan Under.  Right.  And chilling.  Chilling.  And what did Colonel Sanders say?  Bro-ing down.  What were they doing?  They were at probably a dinner or a lunch together or something like that.  And Colonel Sanders...  My dad met a lot of weird people.  Colonel Sanders steps up to your pops.  Wait, you didn't step up to them.  Let me tell you something, Mr. Roberts.  I'll tell you what happened.  He grabbed his father...  Colonel Sanders grabbed his father's balls and said, 
[00:12:00]  Trust me, I know.  Nothing worthwhile will ever come out of these.  I mean, you.  And my siblings.  Yes.  I meant more you.  It's also coming in.  The story is your dad tickled the Colonel's balls with his mustache.  Oh, man.  Listen, Colonel Sanders had just as much odd facial hair as my father did.  That's true.  It was a mutual tickling.  That's why they felt like they could bond over some racist shit. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, a little hint.  A little hint about what was said.  Here's what I'll do.  Oh, boy.  I will not give the exact quote, but I will say that apparently Colonel Sanders was in favor of the white Australia policy.  White Australia policy?  And said so with colorful language.  Can we play act it?  You're a politician, man.  You're just a politician.  Like the rest of them.  Maybe I could play the part of your dad, and you could play the part of Colonel Sanders. 
[00:13:00]  That's a terrible idea.  Maybe this is the day your career takes off, because you show the world you have balls.  Now, tell the story.  That's not the way it works anymore.  It works that way.  Besides, I'm dealing with a room full of one guy who's got comedy to fall back on, and two guys who are sick of all this bullshit anyway.  Oh, man.  Is that what we got to fall back on?  You're a person who's 28 years old and trying to come up with something in this godforsaken business. 
[00:13:30]  Some people are now speculating that you look aboriginal, and that perhaps when your dad was down there, he did do some banging with an aborigines woman, and that's where you came from.  It was the 70s.  Is that what happened?  And second of all, it doesn't make any sense, because then the woman would have to have given birth to me, and that would have been documented.  Well, they messed up a little bit, because wasn't your mom down there, too?  Of course.  Oh, maybe your mom had sex with an aboriginal man.  I wasn't born in the 70s or in Australia.  Maybe she held the jizz for a while. 
[00:14:00]  It's aborigid jizz.  It explains the eyebrows, Sam.  It really does.  Listen, my sister was born before I was, and that was after Australia.  Well, that was like a normal thing they did together.  I say, I say, Mr. Roberts, it's a pleasure to meet you.  I enjoy your campaign you have put together for our wonderful chicken company.  Something like that.  The colonel, right?  Right.  He's like, ah, I like the colonel from Boogie Nights better.  I have more in common. 
[00:14:30]  Well, maybe not.  How would you tell the story?  Come on.  I just told it.  Ah, Mr. Roberts, hello.  Ah, what a great day it is down here in Australia.  We're opening up some new stores down here, and I do like what you've done with the place.  I'll see, I'll see.  He loved Australia.  He did.  Loved it.  Apparently, he did.  Colonel Sanders loved it.  Loved it.  And why did he love it?  Well, there's a population.  As per Father Roberts, why did he love, in the words that he allegedly told your dad, 
[00:15:00]  why did Colonel Sanders love Australia?  That's another thing.  I'm not going to direct quote it and then source it to my father.  What happened?  And ruin the reputation of all the Roberts family.  Sam, what happened?  I told you.  It was supposed to be a quick story that you told us right before the mics were on.  Yeah.  I told you what happened.  We can't go on with the radio show now.  Yeah.  Just say it.  I told you what happened.  They had a conversation.  Yeah.  Colonel Sanders loved Australia. 
[00:15:30]  Why?  Because of...  Did he say to your father that he loved Australia?  Yes.  He was explaining some of his favorite parts of Australia.  So he said, I love Australia.  Right.  And he said, I love it because there are no...  Right.  You can fill in the blank.  There are no...  Yeah.  Flying cars?  That's not it.  There are no flying cars here.  That's what Colonel Sanders said.  It had to do with the immigration policy.  All right.  There are no immigrants?  That's not...  Immigrants wasn't the word, though.  Why would he say that?  I believe he is the derogatory term. 
[00:16:00]  Maybe.  He could have, you know.  There are no foreigners.  Yeah.  Did he say foreigners?  He didn't say foreigners.  Oh, so your father said, why do you like Australia?  And he said, because there are no foreigners.  I just said he didn't say foreigners.  Oh, he didn't say foreigners.  No, no.  Because there are no...  Let's put it this way.  There's only six days in the week?  Yeah, that's right.  Okay.  Well...  That's right.  I don't get that.  Yeah, he does. 
[00:16:30]  You should totally get that.  Six days.  They only have six days.  They don't have...  Oh, right.  I'll say this.  Mondays.  Yeah.  People got in trouble for saying Mondays.  What do you mean?  Who did?  That's supposedly a racist term.  Who got in trouble for that?  Who?  Who got in trouble for that?  Come on.  Come on, people.  Come on, pal.  Talk.  Sometimes you got to work, too, motherfuckers.  Wait, no Mondays is a racist.  What's that mean?  Um, it's a derogatory term for black people. 
[00:17:00]  Is it like a substitution, like Canadians, when they want to say blacks, they say Canadians?  Yeah.  Oh.  A cop at a minor league baseball game said it.  What did he say?  Something about Mondays.  Yeah.  And it's because...  It got that term because nobody likes Mondays.  This thing says it was the popular comedian Russell Peters, a Canadian of Indian descent,  who put Monday on the map.  Really?  Wow.  During a stand-up routine for Def Comedy Jam.  Wait a minute.  Fuck, we should have asked him about this yesterday. 
[00:17:30]  Peter tells of a Bostonian referring to blacks as Mondays.  Wow.  Damn, I didn't know that was him.  So Colonel Sanders might not have liked Mondays?  I'm going to say this.  Colonel Sanders and Anthony would have had a lot to talk about.  Wow, Sam's assuming you're really racist.  No, Colonel Sanders was a pedophile.  Colonel Sanders was a homosexual.  Colonel Sanders enjoyed the feeling of another man's foreskin over his genitals. 
[00:18:00]  Wow.  More importantly, we were listening to the after show yesterday on the way home.  What did you think?  I like it.  I'm not going to play the game like everyone else does.  I do like it.  And I have noticed, and I think the rest of the guys have noticed, that you get a very  different E-Rock.  It's all balls.  You get a very confident E-Rock, like, oh, he notices no one's around.  Right.  He doesn't have to watch his back.  He doesn't have to be on guard.  He's just very confident in the moment.  You ask him something, and he's right there. 
[00:18:30]  Right.  He doesn't have to think about his answers.  He doesn't have to think about how are these words going to be misconstrued against me.  Right.  Do we have a quick example of E-Rock being very confident on the after show?  Just to set this up.  So what did you do in London?  The first time we were there, we started in London and then did a...  Who's we?  Me and my family.  Oh, Mama Nagel.  We did a tour around the UK, going to different castles and stuff.  Oh, that sounds lame.  No, it was great going through Scotland, Wales, Ireland. 
[00:19:00]  You love your tourist locations, don't you?  A castle?  Yeah, if you're in England, I would say castles are tourist locations.  Yes, 100%.  It was a great time.  You don't think a castle is a tourist spot in England?  It's an historical landmark.  Right.  That's where tourists go to.  It's like going to the Statue of Liberty.  Right?  Yeah, okay.  I see what you're saying.  Opie and Jim are listening in the car, I guess, because I just got a text from Opie that  says, me and Jim hate confident E-Rock.  Yes. 
[00:19:30]  So it was the back and forth and the natural...  It's back and forth and you could hear all the places where he would just get destroyed.  Right, yeah.  But he knows that's not going to happen, so he could continue with his thought.  Yeah, he goes like, you know, hey, what are you talking about?  Yeah, hey.  Kind of fights back.  He's confident E-Rock.  He's in the moment.  Yeah.  He's very confident with what he's saying and he's going to argue his point.  Yeah.  You're very confident.  So then I sent that text to Sam.  He wrote it.  And what we got is E-Rock.  Oh my God. 
[00:20:00]  I've got it over here now.  It's one of my favorite, by the way, after show moments of all time.  Right here?  I laughed so hard.  I was listening.  Is this just...  Is this the setup and what he has to say, hopefully?  Yeah, it's the setup.  Okay, all right.  I was listening and, yeah, I was just, like, looking at my radio saying, what?  E-Rock, what?  I love that we could just text from a car on the way home and just completely destroy his  flow.  Yeah.  Because now he knows you're listening.  I love it.  Oh, no.  This is how it went down.  Opie and Jim are listening in the car, I guess. 
[00:20:30]  Because I just got a text from Opie that says, me and Jim hate confident E-Rock.  Well, then come back here and shut up.  Oh, God.  E-Rock's hiding his head.  What the fuck was that?  Shut up.  That's all it takes, though?  For the wheels to fall off.  You've got to put that on the replay.  Why don't you make like a tree and get out of here?  Opie and Jim are listening in the car, I guess. 
[00:21:00]  Because I just got a text from Opie that says, me and Jim hate confident E-Rock.  Well, then come back here and shut up.  Oh.  What a comeback.  And then E-Rock admits this shortly after that.  Well, then come back here and shut up.  I don't even know what that means.  Come back here and shut up.  Why would they come all the way back here just to shut up?  I don't know. 
[00:21:30]  You're already losing your confidence.  Oh, yeah?  Well, the jerk store called, and they're all out of you.  But he would screw it up.  The jerk store called, and they're out of me.  Out of me.  Jerk store.  I had sex with my wife.  What?  Wait a minute.  Sure you did.  I hope she enjoyed it.  Well, why don't you come back here and shut up?  Oh, boy. 
[00:22:00]  I love it.  See, how's it going?  I thought, though.  Come back here and shut up.  You're good.  Oh, Chip thinks it was a great comeback.  I would say, yeah.  Come back here and shut up.  Would you guys have considered having Kenny turn the car around so you could come back and  then scan your cards again, get on the elevator, go all the way up, pass the security desk,  down the hall, into the studio, so you could come in and shut up?  Yeah, exactly.  Just shut up.  I love how he admits that his confidence fell apart, though.  That wasn't what he had.  Yeah.  He told me off the air that he had intended to say something else, but the minute your 
[00:22:30]  names came up, his brain got completely flustered and he said the wrong thing.  He really is like a beaten dog.  He just cowers in the corner, shaking.  Well, Iraq, why would you want us to come back and shut up?  I don't understand.  I'm not saying it's not a great comeback, but why would we do that?  Yeah.  That is not what I meant.  That's not what I meant.  What did you mean?  Yeah, what were you trying to say?  I think I was trying to say, why don't you come back here and make me shut up? 
[00:23:00]  And after he's, Sam's just sitting there laughing and looking intently into the monitor, knowing  that I'm going to fuck up, that I said what you just heard.  Oh, so you meant to say, why don't you come back here and make me shut up?  But you said, why don't you come back here and shut up?  I forgot a few words in there.  Which would show a lot of confidence, right?  That would be a ballsy, confident thing to say.  Shut up!  Is that uncomfortable?  Oh, I hate that one.  Did you feel that humiliation again in young Iraq? 
[00:23:30]  Oh, my God.  Hey, Sam, you're up for just about anything, right?  Yeah.  I got a great idea that just came in from KDK3.  Yes, you're up.  Would you do a live show from the intern's pool party?  Yeah.  You would?  Absolutely.  That would be an easy setup.  Yeah, let's set it up.  Let's do a show.  So, we'll do a weekend.  I got the time slot on Sunday.  If we move the party to Sunday.  Or we'll just move your time slot.  Yeah.  Time slot for one weekend. 
[00:24:00]  I want to do the party Saturday so we can stay out late.  I don't have to get up Monday morning.  Right.  I mean, that day, Monday morning.  Oh, yeah.  What day is it?  Rob is an idiot.  He is a moron, huh?  He fucking, like, he was all upset about his invitations yesterday.  Well, he's, just so people know, he's the intern that invited us to his little pool party.  Stupid house.  As you described, needy intern.  Needy intern.  He brought in these homemade invitations yesterday.  They were made like construction paper and crayon and fucking old little cut fringes around the edges and everything. 
[00:24:30]  And we looked at them.  We talked about them, read them.  And then I threw mine in the garbage.  Opie ripped his in half and threw it in the garbage.  And Jim just left his here on the console.  Of course I did.  And then I get home and I check Twitter and Rob's got his little tweet and it says, it's a picture of all the invitations just sitting here.  And it says, thanks, guys.  Right.  And I just tweet it back.  I'm like, what the fuck are we supposed to do?  Hang him on the refrigerator?  Put a little gold star on him?  When I read your response.  What the fuck did you want me to do?  Hang it up on the fridge?  Hang it on the fridge? 
[00:25:00]  And count down the days?  Yeah.  To the big pool party?  Here's the deal.  I know when the date is of the party.  I don't have to call the RSVP.  I could just look at him and go, yeah, I'll fucking, you know, I'll go.  And I'm sure we'll be talking about it.  So we don't need to be reminded.  Yeah.  So what was I supposed to do?  Take his little invitation home?  Stop it.  We should all just go there and shut up.  Oh, man.  Shut up.  Yuck. 
[00:25:30]  One text.  He just collapses.  He just collapses.  Where is he?  Taking his shit?  Oh, there he is.  Oh, all right.  He's making, he's stirring up some kind of nice beverage for himself.  Oh, what kind of treat do you think he's making?  He's always got to stir it up.  He's got to add a little something.  Take your healthy water and putting in fun powder.  He's got to stir everything.  Yeah, I've never seen anyone stir as much as E-Rock when it comes to getting some hydration.  What are you drinking right now there, E-Rock?  It's hot black tea with honey. 
[00:26:00]  Aw.  Why honey?  You have a sore throat?  No.  I've been...  A little brandy.  Knock it right out.  Huh?  No sugar.  Oh, okay.  Well, honey has sugar.  Natural sugar, not like...  Well, natural sugar.  Natural sugar is kind of bad, too.  Oh, boy.  Do people understand that?  How much honey do you need?  How much treat do you need?  He loves sweets.  It's a cup of honey with a bit of cheese.  It's a treat.  Yeah.  Everything has a little cheese.  Everything has to be a treat.  Sam is right.  It's a fucking jar of honey with a little tea dumped on it. 
[00:26:30]  I was watching B's shows last night.  I fucking love honey, man.  It's called royal jelly.  I hate honey.  Oh, God.  Do you really?  The royal bagels.  Honey's overrated.  Did you ever eat honey?  Like, I got some out of our supermarket.  Right.  It was, like, crispy on top.  I'll try it, yeah.  Really fucking real...  That's raw honey.  Oh, is it good?  Yeah.  Is raw honey good?  I don't like honey.  It's good, but you can't have too much of it, because you'll get...  What do you mean, it's sick?  Because it's raw.  It's not fully processed.  I don't get sick, but it's delicious.  What's he talking about?  You're like, it's a lot of honey. 
[00:27:00]  And how much is so much honey that you would get sick, you wouldn't...  No human would eat that much honey.  Why don't you scoop it out of the hive with your bare hand?  Like a little bear.  Shut up!  Shut up!  How do you get sick from honey?  I never...  But I don't eat enough to get sick.  I'll have, like, one scoop with a little low-fat...  I take a scoop, I scoop out the honey...  I don't like honey.  And I dip it in fucking, like...  I chew it with low-fat ice cream.  It's lovely.  What?  Really?  You mix honey and ice cream?  Oh, my...  Dude, it's fucking phenomenal.  I'll have to try that. 
[00:27:30]  I'm not against it.  I guess I gotta try it.  So, I'm not...  But it's...  The top is crispy, like you're scraping the raw honey.  I love that.  Yeah.  The bees work.  Sometimes they sell it with the fucking bee cone in there.  Yeah, with the honeycomb in it.  I like a real fresh bee.  Do you eat the honeycomb?  Yeah, of course you do.  Well, he used to go to the honeycomb hideout.  Oh, yes.  Remember come to the honeycomb hideout?  I'm distracted, because we were gonna talk about this, and now it's on TV.  The weightlifter?  Oh, no.  How did he not break his neck?  Yeah, that looks like a neck snapper. 
[00:28:00]  I think everyone has seen this video by now, right?  None of that, but the bar brushes against this ball bag.  How many pounds was that?  He's okay.  400 and...  I gotta be 10, 20 pounds.  Oh, I would have thought heavier.  And I think he won the gold medal anyway.  For what?  He gets it over his head.  I think it was a clean lift, and then...  Being an oaf.  And then he collapses, and the bar hits him in the back of the neck.  And in the end, he's fine.  Wow.  Yeah.  How many pounds was that?  And did he win the gold?  I think so.  Pounds, baby.  I guess it doesn't matter that much, but... 
[00:28:30]  And then there's a funny clip of Allie Reisman.  I guess she won the gold for the floor routine last night, and her parents are in the audience,  of course.  And...  Those are the wacky parents that look like they were on the rollercoaster?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That video we've all seen?  Yeah.  So she wins the gold.  They stand up, and the father's like, yeah, yeah.  And there's a guy sitting behind him.  You see him sitting there, and he goes, sit down!  Like, he's pissed that he can't see.  If you're cheering on your own kid at the Olympics, that whole sit-down thing doesn't work. 
[00:29:00]  No!  Any other time, the sit-down asshole, it's not about you, works.  But if it's the parents of the person that is performing for a gold medal, guess what?  Yeah, I think it's okay.  It's fine.  I think you can fucking...  Yeah, they showed a longer video where the guy's getting really pissed because he's standing  the entire time.  Yeah.  Wait, who is...  Is that the parents?  Yeah, those are the parents.  The guy behind the father with the white shirt there is...  Watch how annoyed he gets.  Well, what, are you going to play the whole routine, Sam? 
[00:29:30]  I don't know where the...  Yeah.  Well, this just starts.  I think it's after she, like, wins or something.  She won gold, huh?  She won the gold.  On the floor?  Yes, on the floor exercise.  I hear it's the first time an American has won.  Really?  The floor exercise.  Yeah.  First time ever.  I still liked that Aaliyah, that Russian girl.  Oh, she always looks like she's going to cry.  Oh, yeah.  Give him a hug after her.  Good.  Sam is completely guessing this is the part of the video we need.  This is their final humbling move. 
[00:30:00]  Wow.  That was a good one.  That was good, right?  Yeah.  It was amazing.  Yeah.  And she's very happy with herself.  And she did the Vogue like Bill Burr said.  Now, the guy behind him, he's Mr. Fuddy Duddy.  He's so annoyed.  There's the father, so proud.  His daughter just turning in a gold medal winning performance.  And this old fucking codger doesn't want to see the back of dad. 
[00:30:30]  Well, by the way, they have a mic.  Can you back up a little?  Did you hear what the father said?  The mic by him kind of caught it.  Oh, really?  The mic by him kind of caught it up, yeah.  Yeah.  What happened?  After his daughter did the gold medal thing.  Let me see.  Play it again.  Look what fell out of my cock!  Look what my cock did!  Fell out.  You've got to be proud of your sperm at that point, right?  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's just pointing.  You guys can't see it, but he gets hands over his head, and he just keeps pointing at 
[00:31:00]  his wife's pussy.  Oh, Jesus.  I got gold medal sperm.  Yeah.  You know how horrible it's got to be for a dad to watch this when his daughter's maybe  like a fucking stripper or just some porn chick, and he's like, God, imagine what that's like  to sit there and watch your daughter win a gold medal in the Olympics, and he just knows  he's seen his daughter in interracial porno or something.  But then again, you could say that maybe this dad at the Olympics watches the other dad and 
[00:31:30]  goes, how great it must be to be allowed to jerk off to your daughter.  I have no excuse.  I just don't know if that's how you look at him.  I guess.  Shut up.  The press is always a greener.  Is there more of the guy behind the father?  A little.  A little bit.  Look, he's seriously annoyed.  He's all pissed.  He's shaking his head.  It's the father of the broad, though, man.  I know.  You've got to kind of let that happen.  You've got to let that happen.  You've got to watch the coach molest your daughter.  Yeah.  Gives her a big hug.  That's another one.  Gives her a nice big hug and kisses.  Open the butt crack. 
[00:32:00]  Kisses.  You saw the dive, right?  That video they're trying to get rid of, it pops up here and there, and then NBC or  the Olympics, whoever the fuck is.  German diver.  Why?  Because they're trying to control every clip out there.  But why?  It happened.  The guy fell.  Not fell.  His dive went a little wrong, and he landed flat on his back or some shit.  It's a great video.  Yeah.  I think they just want it on their sites or whatever, so any other site trying to post  it, they're getting rid of it.  Yeah.  It's the diver that landed on his back. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, he tries.  You see this one, Jimmy?  No, I have not.  Worst dive ever, they're saying.  Ever in the Olympics?  Worst dive ever in the Olympics.  That's amazing that people haven't done that in the past.  The timing to spin like that and then straighten out and hit the water hands first.  That's what's pretty amazing about the whole sport.  I've seen some bad dives where their legs are a little bent or they go in at a weird  angle, but this guy just completely flopped in.  Just get on with it. 
[00:33:00]  Four, three and a half.  And that's it.  Oh!  There you go.  The first calamity.  That's laughing.  Sorry about that.  How humiliating.  Oh, my God.  You think he's embarrassed?  He did a backward belly flop.  He landed flat on his back.  Holy fuck.  That had to hurt.  And it looked great up until then.  He's obviously an Olympic diver, so he probably knows how to not do that.  You think he just did like a high jump?  He did a 30-foot diving board dive off a 20-foot board? 
[00:33:30]  Or I'm suspicious that maybe he knew he wasn't going to win a medal and decided, this is  my way of making a mark.  By the way, he ought to have been judged on just the fact that he could jump on the diving  board like that.  Imagine, they're right at the edge of that diving board.  They launch themselves up off of it and have to land back on.  Do they all do it twice?  Not all of them.  Some of them just go right to the edge with their toes and jump off.  But look at this.  He's up.  You know what it's like to hit that again?  I would try to face it.  Oh, here you go.  Let's hear the announcers. 
[00:34:00]  I want to hear what the...  Calamity.  Calamity.  Oh, here you go.  The first...  Oh, here you go.  The first calamity.  Oh, oh my goodness.  It's silent in here.  Sorry about that.  I think he's okay.  I can talk you through it.  What happened?  He landed on the end of the diving board and his foot completely slipped off the side.  He probably lost a toenail or two there.  Ow!  And therefore, look at this.  Slips off the side of the board.  He doesn't get in his pipe shape.  Only has hold of one leg.  Looked a bit like the Isle of Man and then absolutely smacks himself like he's just been 
[00:34:30]  slammed in wrestling.  Oh, I think that is a failed dive.  Zero moves across the board.  Stefan Fecht is out of it.  I didn't know he slipped off the board.  Yeah.  I think the American did that too.  He slipped off the side of the board and just wound up doing a...  You saw that?  Oh, yeah.  He went over kind of backwards.  A very basic dive.  Like, oh, fuck.  Basic dive.  He's like, shit, there's my Olympic moment.  That was four years down the drain.  Yeah.  Imagine the pressure you've got to feel in these events.  Four years. 
[00:35:00]  I mean, a lot of these athletes know they're not going to medal.  To them, they're so happy they're just Olympians.  Yeah.  But the ones that know, you know, I got a chance at this.  Yeah.  The pressure and the stress you've got to feel during your event.  Yeah.  Any other highlights?  I really like watching the women's beach volleyball.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was pretty cool.  For the obvious, I mean, the bikinis are tiny, but it's just a cool sport to watch.  It's way better than...  I don't know, though.  It's just two on two.  It's pretty cool.  They don't even get into the indoor volleyball, though, too. 
[00:35:30]  A lot of face fucking smashes on the indoor.  Holy shit, yeah.  They go up to spike, and it's like they just throw their body in front of it.  Right.  Yeah.  I like the two on two, though.  That's pretty fucking...  It's amazing that they even get to that ball sometimes.  Right.  And keep the volley going.  You've got to get into it.  That's one sport I like watching.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  A lot of these Olympic sports, I don't want to watch field hockey.  No.  The water polo is fun for a little while because you don't see it usually.  Yeah, some of them are good for a little while like that.  Even the diving is pretty cool, like just a little bit of it. 
[00:36:00]  Things like that rowing, go fuck yourself.  I can't watch anything like that.  I don't like these sports where after a while you feel like they're all doing the exact same thing.  And you have to be a judge to go, well, no, that one wasn't as exact as the other guy because his leg was slightly off.  You know what I mean?  Like with beach volleyball, it's unpredictable.  Yeah.  You've seen some really cool plays.  Oh, no, the track I don't like, the running, but I like kind of the pole vaulting is pretty cool.  Some of the other shit that they do.  You don't like the sprints?  No, it's just, all right, you're running. 
[00:36:30]  It's really, there's no real oomph to that.  I don't know.  Well, Usain Bolt is making a pretty...  Yeah, but it's just, all right, look at him run fast.  Just, there's no, like there's nothing there that's going to really kind of happen.  Are you a big fan of the marathon?  Oh, Jesus.  No.  Yikes.  No, and then the, of course, the women's gymnastics.  I watched that one.  Can we see beach volleyball today?  I'm not going to wait for Bob Costas tonight.  We got two American teams playing for the gold in women's beach volleyball. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  I want to see it live today.  How do I do that?  Do I go to the internet?  Are they going to have it on TV, on one of those weird channels?  Where are we at?  And at what time?  If you go to NBCOlympics.com, they have all the events live streaming.  Live streaming.  So when is the beach volleyball gold medal match?  Because they're what?  How many hours are they ahead?  Six?  Eighteen hours ahead.  Eighteen hours ahead.  Six hour difference.  Eighteen hours ahead.  Fuck.  So they're like into Thursday already?  It's actually three days ahead, yeah.  Three days.  You should go there.  The Olympics are over, I guess.  You should come back here and have crumpets. 
[00:37:30]  Two p.m.  Our time.  Two p.m.  Our time.  I can watch it online.  But if we're all here, isn't it our time?  Nice.  I wish Spicoli had told that guy to get in here and shut up.  You wish who?  Oh, man.  Spicoli.  Oh, okay.  Oh, man.  Mr. Han, why don't you come back here and shut up?  Shut up.  Well, Mr. Spicoli, that doesn't make any sense.  Doesn't make any sense.  Any other Olympic shit? 
[00:38:00]  We've done a pretty good job with it, I think.  Come back here and shut up.  I'll leave your words up here, Iraq, for everyone to see.  All right.  Iraq.  I'm going to tell them to come back here and shut up.  Iraq, we're secretly hoping we weren't going to come back and shut up.  Oh, yeah, Iraq?  Well, I'm no band leader. 
[00:38:30]  Look, he's shaking his head.  Ah, Iraq.  And a man in my position cannot afford to come back and shut up.  And before the end of the decad, we want to go to the moon and come back here and shut up and do those other things.  Mr. Gorbachev, come back here and shut up.  Mr. Gorbachev, come back here and shut up. 
[00:39:00]  Iraq!  Ah, shit.  Oh, is that great?  You like that moment, huh, Sam?  That was my favorite.  Nice.  He knew.  It was so good.  As soon as I started laughing as hard as I did, he knew he was in trouble today.  It was just a dumb text, too.  How does he fall apart over a dumb text?  He fell completely apart. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  I need you to come back here, Batman, and shut up!  Wow, babe.  Oh, that's fucking, you know.  That was scary.  That's a little harsh.  Whoa.  Can we finally talk about how that movie was just average, by the way?  It was just average.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think we did from the beginning, right?  It was all right.  Yeah.  After Heath Ledger, it's tough to compete with that, right? 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  They were going to keep talking!  Karen, I told you to come back here and shut up!  That confidence is all we had, Karen!  Why don't you come back here and shut up and get your fucking shine box?  Ruined my fucking after-show appearance.  Don't get nervous.  Don't get nervous.  How are you feeling brave?  Come back here and shut up! 
[00:40:30]  Where's the confident E-Rock?  Oh, where is he?  Where is he?  He should be jumping in and defending himself a little bit here.  Where is the confident E-Rock?  I told you a long time ago not to come back here and shut up, you fucking little monkey!  You expect me to believe Omar shut up because Sosa said so?  It's the worst comeback ever.  I don't think there's ever been a worse comeback. 
[00:41:00]  No, it's terrible.  It just doesn't make sense.  Wait, are you guys talking about this?  Opie and Jim are listening in the car, I guess?  Because I just got a text from Opie that says,  Me and Jim hate confident E-Rock.  Well, then come back here and shut up.  Well, then come back here and shut up.  And there was the pause as if, like, oh, I'm going to think of a good comeback.  Here it comes.  And that's what followed.  The fucking virus shot went out.  Here it comes.  Hey, guys! 
[00:41:30]  Come back here and shut up!  He rocked.  Did you know right after you said it you had made a mistake?  Yes.  He took so long to say yes.  Because he got no confidence.  Because he was thinking, maybe I got something right there.  Yeah, yeah.  No.  He doesn't.  Plaza 27.  Read my lips.  Just come back here and shut up.  Yes.  That's a good one, too.  Oh, man. 
[00:42:00]  So, any other Olympic shit?  I almost texted you last night because the Americans were playing the Chinese in the beach volleyball.  And, once again, not much going on with the hair.  No, the Chinese just have the regular hairstyle.  Although, the Chinese broads are definitely hotter than our American broads on the beach volleyball.  Their asses, really?  Chinese not known for their great asses.  Well, our problem with our American beach volleyball players, they have fried eggs for boobies.  Yeah.  They have horrible boobs. 
[00:42:30]  Terrible.  And Misty, you think, is hot because of her name, but she's got a big mole and it's very distracting.  Oh, boy.  And her butt does what you used to do with the squishy sides.  Oh, it's kind of started squishing out to the sides a little bit.  They call that secretary spread.  What an awful thing.  She's got a bit of the secretary spread.  Secretary spread.  But the Chinese women last night, not bad.  Yeah?  I would love to know how tall they were.  That's all I wanted to know.  They've got to be tall, right? 
[00:43:00]  They have to if they're playing beach volleyball.  Yeah.  But isn't that a rarity for the most part?  It probably is, but God only knows that they could go over there in China.  Yeah.  Probably fly around in their fucking frontier land.  But I hope they win.  Nine tall girls.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  I hope they win the gold.  Wow.  I was looking at that Chinese.  Is that the ones that were playing?  It was 2008.  Oh, Jesus.  You're four years behind.  Oh, my God.  They had a girl fall right at the end of her floor routine, one of the gymnasts last night. 
[00:43:30]  I guess she was from the Ukraine or something.  I don't know.  But she fell right on her ass on the last fucking thing she had to do.  And it looked like she was gearing up to maybe get some kind of medal.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But then USA pulled it off.  USA.  The good old USA.  Yeah.  And then some older broad, too.  Some 24-year-old wound up getting the bronze.  Okay.  And she did pretty good.  She was wearing like they gussied her up in a little more sexy of an outfit. 
[00:44:00]  And her dance was a little sexier and seductive as opposed to the littler girls that they put in those little fucking tidy things.  They were trying to get the judges to look at the sex appeal.  Yeah, I guess if you look a little older and have a more mature body, they sex them up a little bit.  I noticed.  Of course.  Oh, I noticed.  Of course you did.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I noticed those things.  We're waiting through a commercial so you can see the Chinese broads. 
[00:44:30]  Feng Shih, 23 and 27.  Got off to a bad start, but they seem to be coming on a little, Kevin Wong.  The number two seed in the Olympics.  They're up against one of the scrappiest teams in the tournament.  Scrappy.  The Schweiger sisters.  The Schweiger sisters.  Hey, I was with the Schweiger sisters last night.  Whoa, Cunningham.  Nobody up.  Shway with a dig.  Doris digs back.  See, now we're just watching.  Watch the cut shot here.  No, she pounced. 
[00:45:00]  Damn, how did they get that?  Look at that shit.  That should have just been a fucking.  You don't like it, Jimmy?  Stephanie.  You don't like beach volleyball.  You don't like watching.  Not as an Olympic sport.  What Olympic sports do you like watching?  Almost zero.  Why?  Boxing.  It just bores me.  Who gives a fuck about beach volleyball?  I like, I guess, boxing.  I like gymnastics I get, diving I get, track and field.  Not really, huh?  No.  If it's on, I can see why people are interested, but it just does nothing for me. 
[00:45:30]  Beach volleyball?  Yeah, look at this.  They've got little bikinis on.  I get that.  They've got the music cranking.  It's all just fun.  It's just dicks.  There's a bit of rock and roll involved.  International pride in this nonsense.  You don't like it?  No.  Some tanks.  I don't take it seriously, but it's fun to check out every four years.  Although I think I like the Winter Olympics better.  Yeah?  I think so.  You know why?  There's a lot more speed-oriented sports. 
[00:46:00]  Right.  It's a lot more dangerous.  I think that's why that Winter Olympic thing is a little more cool.  Well, I love the hockey, obviously.  Big fan of the hockey.  Yeah, well.  Did you see that?  The one sport I don't understand is the bike thing.  Did you see the indoor bike thing?  No.  Where, maybe someone can explain this, where the race starts and they play like a game  of cat and mouse.  Oh, they go really slow, right?  For half the fucking race, and then all of a sudden someone decides to take off?  What's that all about?  Why wouldn't you just take off? 
[00:46:30]  Just laugh everybody a few times?  No, it's a two...  Get a good lead?  It's only two participants.  Oh, okay.  And they do a cat and mouse.  The race starts, and they go really slow, where they're almost not even moving forward.  And there's something about you don't want to be in the lead.  I don't get it.  Could you find that really fast?  Do they draft or something?  They get behind the person?  I don't know what it's about.  Ah, interesting.  You know, and it's an angled track or whatever, oval.  Yeah, yeah, banked. 
[00:47:00]  Banked, thank you, banked track all the way around.  And there's some weird strategy where you just play this weird cat and mouse game, and  then finally someone takes off, and then the race is on.  I don't understand the logic in that.  How many people have died in the Summer Olympics?  Compared to the winter?  Without it being like a physical thing, like, you know, dropping dead of a fucking stroke or something.  From the event?  From the event.  Oh, God. 
[00:47:30]  As opposed to the winter, where people have, you know, crashed in those luges and bobsleds and skiing accidents and stuff.  Right.  Yeah, I think that's why.  There's more an element of danger there in the Winter Olympics.  Yeah, you can't even compare the two, I don't think.  It really gets you kind of like, oh, man.  When they go off those big ski jumps, you're just waiting for that agony of defeat fucking roll.  Sure, sure.  Yeah.  Oh, is this it?  Is this it?  Is this for the gold medal?  This is, uh, yeah.  Remember, Australia without a gold medal for these championships.  Try to use some logic here, Ann, and tell me why they do this. 
[00:48:00]  All right.  It's a wooden bank into our track.  You can move forward a little bit.  I'm just reminding you, Pendleton can keep refocused.  Put that out of her mind.  Watch.  Race starts.  They go really slow, Ann.  Look.  Yeah, look at that.  It's fucking...  Really slow.  I think they've got to go around only twice. 
[00:48:30]  And they're way down on the track.  They're in that little blue zone.  And they just look at each other.  This is so silly just watching two people.  They're going really slow.  And then they go up the bank.  All right.  They're intimidated by the strength and power of beers.  That looks fun.  That track.  I would love to just fucking...  And the one will go on a crazy zigzag to stop the other from passing? 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, look.  And then they're at the top of the bank and they're barely pedaling now.  They're almost standing still.  What is this?  What are they doing now?  I don't know why they're doing this.  They're literally just stopping.  Right.  And then...  A move that was inevitable.  She was going to stay there for too long.  So Pendleton rolls to the front.  Now they kind of go back around.  They're not going full speed yet.  No.  Now the Australian just managing the situation.  And now they go back up the bank and they slow down again. 
[00:49:30]  All right.  They're going around.  Good tactics here by Mears.  I don't get it.  I don't get it either.  He's under pressure.  Now they're kind of going fast.  And they're right off for gold.  And now they're gone.  Now they're racing.  Pendleton leads.  Mears tries to jump her down the back straight.  Now they're...  And she's got her on the outside.  And Mears goes to the lead.  That's pretty cool.  Pendleton, I think, is a spent force.  It's Adam Mears' goal, Rick.  It's Adam Mears winning job.  What is that?  I don't know what the fuck that's about.  But it does seem to be an advantage to being second.  Why? 
[00:50:00]  You get that passing thing going on.  I don't know why.  I don't know why.  Maybe because when you're second,  you can see the whole field  as opposed to when you're barely first,  you can't see what's going on behind you?  I don't know.  This guy is saying a draft.  But they're not outside.  So how much of a draft could he get biking indoors?  Wait, wait, wait.  Is this...  Come on.  This can't be true.  What?  In the history of modern Olympics,  only one person has died during an event in the winter.  And there have been five sport-related deaths 
[00:50:30]  in the Summer Olympics.  I don't know if that's possible.  I don't believe you.  With the deluge and the bobsled?  Show your work!  The skiing?  I don't know.  The downhill?  All that crap?  I don't know.  Come on.  You're lying.  Let me say hi to Greg in New Hampshire.  Greg?  Greg!  Hey, good morning, boys.  That track shit is pretty freaking awesome.  By the time they hit the line,  they're going almost 50 miles an hour.  Jesus.  A big part of that is they actually do try to draft a little bit.  And the element of surprise when they come down off of the bank turn, 
[00:51:00]  it's just an awesome race to watch.  I love watching the track shit.  But I don't...  I know you just tried to explain it.  I still don't want to say it.  Why not just go fast?  Yeah, because, I mean, the race is only, what, two laps?  That's three laps, I think.  Three laps, but the first lap and a half, they're just playing this cat and mouse thing.  Right.  Again, they're just trying to get that one guy up front,  and then the element of surprise and any kind of draft at all that they can come off.  If they can get any kind of gap in that surprise coming down off of that bank turn,  it's over. 
[00:51:30]  They just need, like, two bike links, and then, boom, they're done.  I don't get it.  So they go three laps.  So for the first couple of laps, you just want to really conserve your energy as much as possible.  But you don't want the guy getting too far ahead of you.  Right.  And, you know, they come to those full track stands when they're just standing on the bike right there.  They don't want to be the first guy around in that belt lap.  They want to come off of the wall fast.  Any kind of draft that they can get, any kind of element of surprise, they just need, like, two bike lanes.  What's a draft? 
[00:52:00]  A win?  A win draft, Jimmy.  I mean, do you really mean, like, a win draft?  Oh, hell yeah.  They're going almost 50 miles an hour, Jimmy.  By the time they finish that thing, you can't even believe what kind of draft you can get off of the bike.  Yeah, the draft thing is real.  When I used to do a lot of road races, I used to be a runner.  I used to run almost every weekend in these 10Ks and stuff.  When you get behind someone and let them take the wind and the air and all that shit, yeah, it's a big advantage.  Oh, they're blocking the wind for you.  They're blocking everything.  You're almost in, like, a vacuum.  You can save, like, 30% of your energy riding behind the other guy like that, Jimmy. 
[00:52:30]  It's amazing.  Even indoors, though?  Oh, yeah, big time.  I mean, Jimmy, they're going, like, 40 or 50 miles an hour by the time they hit that line.  Now, they should put fans on both of them, on the bikes.  This day is no different than any other day.  Now a guy's saying there's no draft.  It's a slingshot effect.  No, that's bullshit.  I understand conserving the energy.  Why wouldn't they make it then one lap?  Like, okay, ready, set, go.  Start pedaling.  Go full bore.  I kind of like it because it's different.  But hold on a second.  We're going to put Joe on the line with you.  Joe, you're on with Greg in New Hampshire. 
[00:53:00]  Greg?  Joe?  Greg, how could there be a draft if they're going, like, five miles an hour behind each  other and for a lap and a half?  Ooh.  It's the last lap.  Stupid fuck.  It's the last lap when they're going 30, 40, 50 miles an hour.  They're not trying to get behind each other the whole fucking time.  They're trying to pass each other.  There's no draft for the pass.  When you go up the bank and you come down, it's a slingshot effect.  Ooh.  If you know anything about cycling, you would fucking know.  If I know anything about cycling, I ride a bike every fucking day, you stupid ass.  Clowns? 
[00:53:30]  What they spoke are, you got in the spokes.  E-Rock, you want to help this guy out?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we're not going to get the answer now, again.  No.  This happens every time we talk about anything.  If there's a slingshot effect, then why wouldn't you just slingshot effect on your own?  Right.  Why do you need the other guy?  Because you can see, the guy can see behind you, make his move, and then he could try and  get in front of you, which is why they go up and down, up and down.  Right. 
[00:54:00]  Thank you.  Prevent that from happening.  But why don't you just make your move?  Well, that's why I'm not an Olympian.  Yeah.  No shit.  That's crazy to me.  Thanks, guys.  Good show, boys.  Keep beating on E-Rock.  Thank you.  All right.  Joe in Jersey and Greg in New Hampshire.  Thank you, Greg.  You want the truth?  You'll come back here and shut up.  Off Twitter?  For E-Rock.  A lot of people saying they saved their energy for the end.  Yeah.  So I guess they know, all right, the first lap and a half, we're just going to fuck around. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  And then it's go time.  Yeah, yeah, then, yeah.  That's got to be it.  Oh, well.  Kind of cold, though, right?  Two deaths at Summer Olympic Games, two deaths at Winter Olympic Games, only while training  or warming up.  Didn't some guy in a fucking bobsled or something?  The last Olympics, we lost one.  The last Olympics, somebody died.  Training.  We definitely lost one.  Training.  Training run.  Oh, that was a training run?  Yeah.  And how do you die in the Summer Olympics?  In 1912, a runner collapsed from sunstroke and heart trouble at the 29 Columbus. 
[00:55:00]  But that's not what I'm talking about.  I'm talking about he fucking, he trips over a fucking hurdle and smashes his face.  Well, in 1960, Danish cyclist, I'm not going to try with that name, collapsed during the  100-kilometer team trial, fatally fracturing his skull.  All right, that's it.  That's it.  New it in a Mark Jensen.  Dummy.  I'm not a dummy.  He was on amphetamines, which decreased his blood pressure. 
[00:55:30]  See, this, no.  These are not death due to the events.  That's not fucking the event.  He fractured his skull.  He means like the volleyball getting smashed into her face and killing them.  Something like that.  The girl's on the fucking balance beam and she falls and her chin hits the balance beam  and she snaps her neck.  Yeah, why haven't they snapped their necks in gymnastics yet?  I don't know.  That's crazy.  Some of those moves, obviously, pretty well.  So I'm saying there have been 30 Winter Olympic deaths.  Wow, really?  And none.  There actually have been more lives made at the Summer Olympics.  Damn. 
[00:56:00]  All right.  That's not happening.  Oh, Tabasco sauce.  Let's eat, man.  Yeah.  Chris Rock's coming in today.  Chris Rock.  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  We're going to eat, then we'll be back to shut up.  Oh.  Oh.  Somebody tweeted something.  I left a date in Ohio.  I dreamed to come back here and shut up.  And shut up.  E-Rock, that was a dumb back.  See, it's a dumb comeback.  I understand.  That was pretty good. 
[00:56:30]  Thank you, Chip.  Come back here and shut up.  Why don't you go there and shut up, motherfucker?  Go.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The fight through the months ahead for my personal vindication  would almost totally absorb the time and attention of both the President  and the Congress.  Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.  Damn. 
[00:57:00]  Vice President Gore will be sworn in as president at that hour  in this office.  And why don't you come back here and shut up?  Hey.  President Nixon announced he would resign 38 years ago.  That was a big day, huh?  Yes.  President saying, fuck this shit.  You won't have Dick Nixon to kick around anymore  because I'm getting out of here to go over there and shut up. 
[00:57:30]  And he kind of just got on his helicopter and that was it.  Threw his peace sign out.  And the country said, what the fuck?  Peace out, niggies.  That's what he said.  Motherfucker.  I am God, bitches.  Well, not quite like that.  But he did leave.  What happened?  I'm laughing at the Nixon.  Fire.  Fire.  Yeah.  That was pretty. 
[00:58:00]  I was a nerdy kid back in the day.  And I used to watch the Watergate trials.  And there was one other nerdy kid.  Yo, yo, yo.  Yeah.  I know.  I know.  Well, I was very, very young.  Nothing sad.  At the time.  Very young.  And what happened was there was another kid, a real dorky, geeky kid,  that used to also watch the Nixon Watergate trials with Judge Sirica.  And we used to. 
[00:58:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  How do you know it was Judge?  It was Judge Sirica.  Did you just look that up?  No, no.  You always heard about Judge Sirica.  Of course.  Back then.  Of course.  You and three other guys are nodding up.  They're like, yeah, it was him.  How do you know this shit?  Yeah, I know it was Judge Sirica.  And this nerdy kid that we used to talk about and, like, joke about it and stuff  and make, like, little jokes and shit.  And then as we got older, he stayed like this really, he got, like, uber nerdy.  And he was, like, the kid everyone made fun of and stuff. 
[00:59:00]  And I couldn't hang out with him anymore.  And I joined the dark side and started goofing on him.  But we had, you know, had that moment of hanging out and laughing.  And then I just ended up being the guy that also fucking, you know, pushed him down the stairs and shit.  You were at a crossroads right there.  Yeah, yeah.  You could have been the nerdy kid and the CEO of Apple or something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know if anything ever became of him.  He was really a dork.  Did you have friends?  Did you have friends that you loved hanging out with but during school hours you didn't even acknowledge? 
[00:59:30]  Did you have any of those?  Yeah, there were a couple of them.  There were definitely a couple.  You think everyone had that?  Nerdy, geeky science and shit.  But then I couldn't fucking, you know, you couldn't do that in school.  I had a couple nerdy friends, but I just, I would blow them off during school hours.  Because I was trying to build up my cred.  I don't know why.  My coolness.  I met a bunch of cool kids in detention once.  And we all agreed that we were going to hang out with each other. 
[01:00:00]  But it never really happened.  The jock-like was in there.  I think he taped some kids' butt together.  Oh, nice.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's the breakfast club.  Oh, right.  I remember one time I lived in Edison, my friend Bruce Kenny came over.  And we were hanging out.  And some of the other meaner kids started throwing red berries at his bare chest.  And he was crying.  And the bullies, I didn't want to get bullied.  So I just joined them and started throwing berries at my friends.  And you know what's wrong, right? 
[01:00:30]  It's terrible.  I feel shame to this day that I threw berries at Bruce Kenny.  At his bare chest.  Yeah, I don't remember why.  Yeah.  But I just joined them with the bullies because I was scared.  Yeah, that's like poor fucking, what was his name?  Eric Bohannon, I think his name was.  And we used to make him crawl through mud and throw his sneakers in the big mud puddles.  And he'd have to go and get them.  It's really, really just mean.  And it was all funny.  Like, everyone's laughing and everything.  But then, like, right afterwards, you're just kind of like, 
[01:01:00]  Oh, that was fucking mean.  I don't know why you did that.  I'm sorry I did that.  But we got an invite coming in.  What?  We like invites to things.  Wayne, what's up?  Hey, guys.  We're, I work with a band, The Toadies.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Give it up to me.  Give it up to me.  Do you want to be my angel?  Yeah, motherfucker. 
[01:01:30]  I don't know The Toadies.  So help me, Jesus.  Around the lake tonight.  Why is it taking so long, Yaron?  Around the lake tonight.  By my side.  Here comes our 90s break, baby.  It's been two weeks.  It's been two weeks.  Around the lake tonight.  Too bad that's the only song we know.  Oh, there it is.  What band is this?  The Toadies.  Toadies. 
[01:02:00]  This is Possum Kingdom.  This is a great song.  I don't know this.  I still love this song.  Hold on, Wayne.  All right.  Yeah.  We got to, like, bring everyone up to speed.  Come on.  Walk with me.  This is such an AF song for me.  Oh, my God.  Around the lake tonight.  I don't know this one.  I can karaoke this one, I think.  Around the lake tonight.  By my side.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The guitar.  Yeah. 
[01:02:30]  By my side.  This is 90s?  Oh, yeah.  This is mid-90s.  This is, like, 94-ish.  Maybe a little later.  I'm not gonna lie.  I'll not be a gentleman.  Behind the boat house.  I'll show you my dark secret.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:03:00]  Anyway, Wayne.  All right.  So what year was that, Wayne?  Do you know?  I'm gonna go 96.  I'm saying 95.  Whoa.  I said 94.  95?  95 to 98, so...  Yeah, it might be...  Yeah, 94.  Yeah, I just instinctively know dates.  Damn.  Good job, Jimmy, for someone that doesn't really know the song.  I took the guitar, like, to tip me off.  Hey, did you still have that pudgy girl playing the bass?  Oh.  No, no, no longer.  What happened to her?  Who's gone? 
[01:03:30]  Married.  Gone.  Yes.  What happened?  What happened to this guy?  He said that he's basically saying they had to fire the bitch.  Like in Ramrod said that about the girl he killed with the fucking...  And Vice Squad.  Season Hubbly was, like, asking questions.  And she goes, what about you?  And he goes, yeah, I had to fire the bitch.  Meanwhile, he beat her to death with a hanger.  So, sir, what's...  Anyway, we're playing at House of Blues tomorrow night with Helmet.  Helmet!  Unsung! 
[01:04:00]  Let's do some unsung now.  What's Helmet?  Oh, you know Helmet.  Hold on.  I probably do know that.  Hold on a second, Wayne, before you give us the official invite.  Yeah, 90s music, I don't know by name, Wayne.  I have to hear the...  You know Helmet?  E-Rock, give us some Helmet.  I'm the only station that really rocks.  Even though everyone else was playing.  You know this one.  I don't know this one. 
[01:04:30]  So far, no.  I don't know this song.  Nope.  Do not know it.  Oh, yeah.  Ah, there it is.  I knew he'd know it at that point.  I like this.  I like this song, too.  It's a great riff.  Yeah.  This does rock.  I'm trying to remember the vocals.  I don't remember the vocals.  We're the thick fucking puppies.  I don't know this song. 
[01:05:00]  It's got an Ozzy sound, too.  The effect on it.  Yeah.  That sounds like Ozzy a little bit, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Just credit time for showing up again.  This is good.  It's got to get some chorus.  It's got to get some chorus. 
[01:05:30]  It's got to get some chorus.  It's got to get some chorus.  It's got to get some chorus.  Nice.  All right.  I figured that out.  So you got Helmet and the Toadies tomorrow night at the House of Blues here in New York.  House of Blues.  Yeah.  We would, uh, the guys are big fans of your guy.  We'd like to have you down as VIP. 
[01:06:00]  Damn, man.  I would fucking love to, but.  Yeah, we're going to Chicago.  We'll be at it.  We'll be in Chicago.  We're leaving for Chicago.  Right after the show tomorrow.  Damn.  Right.  Where's the House of, which House of Blues do you mean?  In Chicago or here?  In Chicago.  Oh, you.  Oh, whoa.  Oh, whoa.  Whoa.  Oh.  Really?  You guys are in Chicago the same time we are?  Exactly.  Because I was going to invite you guys to come on this show and play some Toadies for everybody. 
[01:06:30]  Everybody's going, where's the House of Blues in New York?  That's what I was saying.  What, they don't have one anymore?  No.  That's why I guessed Chicago.  When did that close?  There's never one here.  What did we think of?  Oh, yeah.  There was one here, wasn't there?  Wasn't there?  Oh, no.  Am I thinking of B.B.  B.B.  B.B.  B.B.  B.B.  B.B.  B.B.  B.B.  That's what I thought.  Wait, we never had a House of Blues in New York.  No.  No, I think.  Well, that was stupid on their part.  I was beginning to think like B.B.  B.B.  B.B.  B.B.  B.B.  B.B.  Yeah.  Wait, we never had.  Next time we're through New York, I'll definitely get the guys up to the show. 
[01:07:00]  And the place you mean is right by the very famous building in the Steve McQueen movie  where they backed a car out of that round building.  You ever see that?  Sure.  Yeah, that's correct.  Out of whatever the Steve McQueen movie is,  and they backed a car out of that fucking giant round tubular garage.  Right.  It's right below that.  It's right next to Harry Carey's restaurant.  Right.  Harry Carey.  Nice.  Well, listen.  Can you give us contact info off the air to EROC  so we can get a hold of you when we get there? 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, I'd love to have you.  Don't let EROC.  All right, remain on hold and don't let EROC insult you because he's really good at it.  Maybe he can just make me shut up.  Oh, damn.  Wayne, I've got to ask you, how's the band doing?  We haven't talked to them in years.  Awesome.  They just released a new album.  The album came out last Tuesday, and they're doing great.  Todd Lewis' voice is better than ever, and they're rocking it, man. 
[01:08:00]  Rocking it.  Where are they popular?  We're all over.  No, but I mean, are you one of those bands that went overseas  and became massively huge after the whole 90s run?  It's been a while is all I'm saying.  They went over to the U.K. once and didn't really do it for them,  so they're a U.S.-based band.  When they went over, did they, like, because, again, for bands,  it's different you can get radio play.  But what happened?  They went to a gig that just wasn't what they wanted? 
[01:08:30]  Did they kind of sense that going into it?  I think it was more label issue, non-promotional.  Yeah, that happens too.  Just throw them over there and see what happens.  And it was back in that day, in the day it was Interscope,  and they were having their own internal issues anyway.  So it's, like, just the opposite of the Ramones.  Like, they drew huge in fucking England, and they couldn't sell shit here. 
[01:09:00]  My point...  Yeah, I mean, the guys are from, you know, Dallas, Dallas-Fort Worth,  and, I mean, you...  It sells out every single time in Dallas.  So they've never gone away.  Oh, no.  Yeah, I mean, a lot of these 90s bands, they went away for a while,  but they're coming back a bit.  That Parson Kingdom song still gets 35, 40 spins a week on any classic rock radio.  Now it's a classic rock song.  Oh, my God.  That happened.  Wow.  Are you kidding me?  I mean, you hear that song every fucking day. 
[01:09:30]  It's awesome.  It's a great song.  Yeah.  All right, Wayne, tell the guys we said hi,  and maybe we'll see you all tomorrow night at the House of Blues.  Hold on, and let...  That'd be awesome.  E-Rock get your info.  Thanks, Wayne.  What do you do for the band, by the way?  I do their monitors, and I own the bus that I'm driving them.  Okay.  That's the bus.  See you again, Wayne.  All right, Wayne.  Hold on, man.  Thanks, man.  Obviously, Wayne listens to the show.  That's cool.  Nice to see.  Yeah.  I know exactly what the House of Blues is.  It's right next to a really cool...  It's in walking distance of our hotel. 
[01:10:00]  Kenny just texted me.  But I usually stay at that hotel right there.  I would love to go see them tomorrow.  They used to come in and do our show,  and they did a few of the beach parties and whatnot up there in the Boston area.  I do that song.  I do that song, man.  Yeah, Possum Kingdom is huge.  All right.  And people are saying that the bike thing,  it's all about drafting indoors.  Oh, yeah.  You still get a draft indoors.  I understand you still get a draft indoors,  but it doesn't seem like it'd be that much of an advantage. 
[01:10:30]  But what the fuck do I know, man?  I don't have no shit.  I got itchy back.  Let me get that.  Why do you keep itching your back?  It's my shoulder blade.  I had...  Oh, right under my shoulder blade, Jimmy.  No, not there.  No.  No, you're missing it totally.  No.  You got skin, like, drying?  Stop.  Don't do it.  Get away from me now.  That was creepy.  I got to use my toodly horse.  It was Edgar.  Edgar doesn't do well.  I'm itching you. 
[01:11:00]  I'm itching.  Was it a terrible scratch?  Terrible.  We actually probably could go see them,  because we're going to be in Chicago.  Yeah.  Do you want to know why?  Why?  Because Friday, we're going to be at 115 Bourbon Street,  which is in Marionette Park,  which I guess is a cool place.  Everyone's like, they do a lot of rock stuff there.  The doors open at 2.  We will be there.  Chicago time.  Oh, it's 4 p.m.  Okay, it's from 3 o'clock on. 
[01:11:30]  Let's just say.  I don't want to say until 5.  From 3 o'clock on.  Get there early, because Sam's doing a pre-show.  And the details are on the Facebook.  If you're a female and you want to participate,  there's a pig race.  We don't have a lot of contestants.  You might be the only one.  It's $1,000.  There's a chance for $1,000.  And bring the oddest thing you own.  Can I stop you there?  Sure.  Because the oddest thing you own,  we're hoping someone beats the freeze-dried monkey.  Oh, yeah.  And I'm stopping you there,  because I actually got a clip from the famous show. 
[01:12:00]  In Philadelphia.  This was at YSP.  Yeah, we've talked about this for years,  and we haven't played this clip in a while.  We love doing the oddest thing you own from time to time,  and we did it at YSP.  There were probably close to 1,000 people  outside the radio station that day.  It was ridiculous.  Fuck, you remember those appearances?  It was ridiculous.  We took over the whole street.  Fuck.  That was fun.  And then we were inviting people to come up.  Remember we had a TV set up for people outside  so they could see what was going on in the studio? 
[01:12:30]  Cha.  It was amazing.  Yeah, I remember that.  And that was the day we were introduced  to the freeze-dried monkey.  Yeah.  So I brought in a freeze-dried monkey.  And I got the clip.  And I'm playing this today,  because we're hoping we get some crazy odd shit  up in Chicago this Friday when we broadcast live.  So here you go.  All right, where's the dead monkey?  Mummy monkey.  Where's mummy monkey?  Mummy monkey.  Monkey monkey.  Guys, don't worry.  More breasts on the way for you outside.  How is that mummified, sir?  It's not.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Don't do anything. 
[01:13:00]  Don't do anything.  That is nothing more than a dead monkey, isn't it?  That's it.  That is not a mummified monkey.  That is just dead monkey in a bag.  Dead monkey in a bag.  Now, where did you get this monkey?  From a biological store.  And they are made for what?  Dicep.  And did he have the AIDS or anything?  I don't think so.  No, he's just a dead monkey.  And how do they prepare the monkeys for being sold?  Like, you would think he would just rot.  Has he been embalmed?  Are you his uncle?  He has been embalmed. 
[01:13:30]  You know what that would make him, Jim?  Ah, forget it.  Oh, the wacky horn.  You just have one at home.  I got a barrel full.  Hey, what type of business is he running?  All right, let's stop throwing a wrench in the works and let him get on with his business.  Lift up the bag.  Wait, don't take it out, though.  No.  Good thing he's not fat.  He'd be ice cream.  Oh, well, let me... 
[01:14:00]  Oh, my God!  Look at that!  Oh, my God!  A dead monkey in a bag.  Dude, he is making...  He's staring at you.  He's in mid-lamp.  He is making the Han Solo stuck in the Carbohite face.  Isn't he?  Look at the monkey.  It was like...  Dead monkey in a bag on the O.P. and Anthony show.  That's good.  Dude, F it and you are in.  Look, his yearning mouth is open. 
[01:14:30]  His yearning monkey mouth.  Look at all the fluids at the bottom of the bag.  Dude, I'll do it.  No, stop it!  He'll do it.  He'll do it.  He'll do what?  Let me put it in the monkey face.  Look at his face.  Dude, this guy will put his mule in a dead monkey's mouth.  Holy shit.  This guy puts a mule in a dead monkey's mouth.  You remember about that day we met Taylor Law, the porn girl, who was in the studio?  Yeah, yeah.  You remember how hot she was?  I wanted to fuck her for ten years.  I never got anywhere.  She had a really nice...  Juicy body. 
[01:15:00]  Nice, yeah.  And do you remember that he put...  Do we have more clips?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, okay, okay, okay.  I haven't heard this in years.  This is at least ten years old.  I remember I had a monumental...  Bomb?  Bomb, not on the show.  Oh.  Not on the show.  You'll explain in a little bit?  Yeah, a big bomb.  All right, let's continue with this from ten years ago.  We did the oddest thing in Philly and a freeze-dried monkey.  I remember the juices at the bottom of the bed.  Yeah, and this was regular radio.  This was broadcast radio. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, yeah.  There was no satellite...  FCC rules and regs.  I pretty much could guarantee we wouldn't be able to bring a freeze-dried monkey into the studio.  Hells no.  On satellite radio.  Guys, guys, is there a point to that?  Oh, shut up.  Come back here and shut up.  I don't know.  I'll put the new one...  All right.  No, no.  All right, so, yeah.  Oh, Danny's running down the hall.  He might have something to add to this.  Yes, Danny?  I was listening, and you said how you would never be able to do this here on satellite radio. 
[01:16:00]  I had to cut a lot of this clip out because it was long.  It was like 20 minutes.  So, even all the stuff that I cut out, you wouldn't be able to do here.  There was two porno chicks going to town on the floor to get this guy prepped.  I don't fucking get him a rod.  So, that would never happen.  No.  And I also cut out, there was, you guys were talking about two of the other guys who were  in contention to win this contest.  Right.  And it was one guy who wanted to eat an old umbilical cord.  Oh, right.  Right, right. 
[01:16:30]  Jesus Christ.  I love that stuff we just forget about.  In anyone else's life, that would be a memory you would never forget.  But we have to be reminded, like, oh, yeah, that's right.  And I cut it out for time, but there was a guy who, his uncle was in Vietnam, he died  in Vietnam, and his buddies killed the Vietnamese soldier that had killed him, and they had  the ear.  I forgot about the ear, too.  And the guy was going to try and chew through it.  Right.  I still don't remember that.  I forgot all of this shit. 
[01:17:00]  A dead Vietnamese ear.  So, think about, in the span of 20 minutes, this 20 minute clip, in real time, you have a  guy sticking his dick into a dead monkey's head, you have two girls on the floor eating  each other out, and a guy, and two guys on deck who want to eat dead body parts.  Wow.  None of this would happen here, ever.  No way.  Not even close.  And the FCC had no problem with this, by the way.  No.  None whatsoever.  No.  Wow.  So, we've got to go old school and get some cool shit for Chicago, is what we're thinking.  Yeah.  That's why we're playing this, to rally the troops. 
[01:17:30]  Because this is the kind of shit that we're all used to here.  Right.  You know, dead monkey, blowjobs, and gook ears.  You guys weren't around, then.  Well, I mean, I was alive.  No, but you weren't around the show, of course.  You were young, Danny.  No, I was delivering pizzas in my car.  Yeah.  It was amazing.  Felt like I was there.  And then in the parking lot, I know we said this last week, but it's worth repeating,  there was a new mom.  Yes.  Oh, I forgot about that.  Was that in the clip?  Yeah, I had to cut it out, though, because the call went on for a bit.  So, yeah, so she ends up running into a buddy of hers that she hadn't seen in a while, 
[01:18:00]  and just decides to blow him.  In front of everybody.  In front of everybody, and her 15-month-old child who's in a stroller.  The 15-month-old, she just gave to someone she thought she could trust to babysit while  she blew this old friend of hers.  Yeah, but he got blowjobs.  She's like, oh, I want them to come up there and blow you guys.  It's just like, this was the kind of atmosphere.  It was unbelievable.  It was at the show.  I couldn't believe it.  It really was just unbelievable.  That kid now is probably 10-ish.  Yeah, he's 10.  10, 11.  Give him blowjobs of his own. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, someone tweeted me yesterday, I didn't get back to him, they're like, remember you  had the countdown clock before that girl turned 18 at N.E.W.?  Whatever happened to her?  Yeah, what girl?  I remember her name.  And I wanted to tweet the guy back and go, well, she's now 30.  That's what happened to her.  Wow.  Her name is Taylor.  You remember her?  Mm-hmm.  She was a girl that came in and basically wanted to do all sorts of crazy shit, but she  was underage, so we started this countdown clock, and then we would bring her back when  she turned 18.  I think they shut that bit down. 
[01:19:00]  I think that was one where they finally said, I think Ken Stevens finally said, look.  Oh, really?  I let you guys do a lot, but this one you might want to leave alone.  Oh, man.  I think.  I think that's what happened with that.  God, we've got to write a book.  It's time.  Anyway, thank you, Danny, for all that shit that we can't do on satellite radio.  But we're going to get people up in Chicago bringing in some weird shit, hopefully.  This will motivate them.  So here's part two.  So someone suggests, was it Jimmy?  To put his mule in his mouth?  Yeah.  Did I suggest it?  I don't remember.  I don't know.  Or did he say he would do it? 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  He might have said it.  Yeah, I don't know.  But here's more of the day where we had the freeze-dried monkey in a bag in Philly at YSP.  I'll put the mule in my mouth.  All right.  No, no.  The guy's like, I will put the mule in the mouth.  He's a Kid Rock fan.  You cannot get a hummer from a dead monkey.  How did it die?  Did someone shock it?  How do you beat a dead monkey hummer? 
[01:20:00]  I will say, dead monkey hummer beats the eating of anything.  Yeah, I see that.  Dead monkey hummer beats anything.  Wait, let's ask the guys outside, maybe.  Oh, my God.  Wait, they're, they're...  What?  Dead monkey!  Dead monkey!  They're chanting dead monkey.  Yeah, I think they're dead monkey.  This is giving me chills.  Like, remember all this shit?  It's douche chill.  Now we're, now we're in a fucking veal box.  I'm getting chills.  Yeah.  Remember?  And Kid Rock, by the way. 
[01:20:30]  I mentioned Kid Rock there.  We were down there for the Kid Rock show.  And to introduce Kid Rock on stage.  I must confess.  Yes.  That was Jimmy.  That's the bomb.  Ladies and gentlemen, that's the bomb, right?  That was the bomb.  I must confess.  Save it.  Save it.  Okay.  Because it's after this whole thing.  Now I totally remember.  That's right.  In front of 5,000 people.  I just want to stop there for a second because I'm getting chills.  Like, fuck, this is what we could be doing.  By the way, hold on. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  I can tell by listening to this, I've had quite a few beers.  Oh, really?  You can just tell?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, it was afternoon drive.  Yeah.  Yep.  And at those appearances, at those broadcasts, it was just beers constantly.  Amazing.  During the show.  Oh, man.  Yeah, I can tell.  But now we got guys.  Do you really need that energy with a radio show?  Yeah.  Guys, after 20 minutes, it gets to be a little redundant.  It's dirty.  Shut up. 
[01:21:30]  It's not for you.  You're not the target demo.  You wear a jacket to fucking work.  You're not the target demo.  And sensible shoes.  Shut up.  Exactly.  Leave us alone.  The target demo is not you.  Yeah.  You're not supposed to like this.  Yeah, guys.  I don't really like it.  You're supposed to understand it.  And it's good.  You're supposed to understand what it is and who it's catering to.  Yeah.  Tim Sabian understood.  Tim Sabian was great.  With his tight fucking slacks and his constant wedgies.  Yeah.  Just following his fucking lima bean ass cheeks all over Philly. 
[01:22:00]  It was horrible.  But he was a fucking great PD, man.  But he understood what we were all about.  And he helped us.  A lot.  He didn't hold us back.  Yeah.  Yes, that's what happens now.  There's no encouraging.  It's like...  Yeah.  We're not even allowed to play this clip, by the way.  I'm going to acknowledge that.  But I'll take full responsibility.  Oh.  Because any clip that breaks these new satellite radio rules, we're not allowed to play anymore.  Even though it happened 10 years ago. 
[01:22:30]  So I guess we can't play...  I guess by that shitty rule, that idiocy, if there's audio of a murder that the news plays,  we can't play it because a murder's not allowed to happen.  Right.  Their arguments are so fucking dumb.  They make no sense.  I'd love to sit with the attorneys and run over them in a debate.  Yeah.  Morons.  That's not going to happen, though.  What is this?  Because we did try that once.  And then we were told all the reasons why we can't do stuff anymore. 
[01:23:00]  Not here, by the way.  I've never met with attorneys here.  I refuse.  Because I already know what they would say to us.  I'm not going to put myself through that again.  Remember K-Rock?  When we finally said, look, you're killing us.  We have to be able to do some of the stuff that made names for ourselves.  And they're like, all right, we'll set up that meeting.  It'll be good for everybody.  And it was a conference room in a stale building.  Yeah, Tracy Clarity was there.  Tom Chiasano.  Tom and Dan Mason, the president of whatever.  And then lawyers just sat there and explained why we couldn't do anything anymore.  I'm like, no, this meeting was supposed to be so maybe we could figure some shit out. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  That's what I knew.  Our time was limited over there.  Anyway, let's get back to this.  Oh, my God.  Wait, they're...  What?  Dead monkey!  Dead monkey!  They're chanting dead monkey.  Yeah, I think they're...  Dead monkey.  If you could see this monkey's face, his hands are up by the side of his head and in these  claw-like things, like he grabbed at the bag and went, and just opened his mouth.  His tongue is sticking out.  He's got his fang.  His eyes are...  Big bug eyes are just closed, but you can tell they're bulging, and this guy wants to 
[01:24:00]  stick his mule.  Oh, my God.  Now, you have said that you would take your mule and get some treats from the dead monkey.  I can't believe I'm saying this.  From the dead monkey.  Now, if you may have been drinking, I will do my best.  All right, go back and...  Show that monkey who's boss.  Go back and prep. 
[01:24:30]  Go back.  You have a visual aid over there for him, and...  Oh, my God.  All right, Anthony.  Somebody get me a monkey suit.  I don't know what was happening when I said, get me a monkey suit.  Well, obviously, the guy was probably trying to stick his dick in the monkey's mouth.  Yeah, you were hoping that maybe you would receive the piece.  I think what you were getting at.  I thought maybe the...  Oh, okay.  Wow. 
[01:25:00]  We got the final clip where it brings it all together, and then we'll get back to our live  Chicago gig.  We'll pump that up, but here's the conclusion.  Believe me, you don't even have to be completely ready.  I don't think the monkey will care.  The monkey's going to be insulted.  I wanted a cuter monkey.  This one's ugly.  Is the guy ready?  Because this is it.  Hey, monkey guy, at this point, whatever you got going, you know, you're going to have 
[01:25:30]  to do it.  Make sure none of that fluid, and I'm talking about the monkeys, gets anywhere.  All right.  I don't need to see this.  For some reason, the guy decided to face my way.  Believe me.  Just...  Oh, my God.  This guy's going to do it.  This guy is going to do it.  That's so bad.  I do remember this, so...  But it's real, man.  Yeah.  It's real fucking excitement and energy.  Oh.  This guy is going to do it. 
[01:26:00]  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Whatever you got to do, just do it.  That's all we got to say.  And you got to do it for a little while.  He's grabbing the back of the monkey's head.  We're going to...  Norton.  Lift your shirt up.  Lift your shirt up.  Lift your shirt up.  We must confirm.  Hot monkey action.  It's going on because...  Oh, my God.  He's doing it. 
[01:26:30]  You can tell from the...  Keep going.  Do it.  Reaction over in the corner.  What?  What?  Wow.  Oh, my God.  It's done.  He's done.  He did it.  He did it.  Put that monkey back in that other bag.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me see.  Rick's got a photo.  Oh.  That just beat the crap out of anything Boston and New York did.  That beat cancer boob.  That beat guy with spleen. 
[01:27:00]  When you're talking, a guy getting treats from a dead monkey.  What is it?  Oh, my God.  We got some unbelievable pictures.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Yeah, that's when we took it around the country.  I forgot.  How did I also go like, that beats cancer boob.  I know.  Guy with spleen.  Right.  That's like, what does that even mean?  I don't even know.  I don't remember anymore.  Remember the cancer boob came into, the guy brought in the, that was one of the things  that he brought in to show us about quitting smoking. 
[01:27:30]  Yes.  The EMS guy came in and brought in a cancerous breast from a cadaver.  Holy, another thing I don't know.  And we all felt it.  I totally forgot.  I got to feel that.  The lump in it through the skin.  Ah.  It was terrible.  It was a big bag.  It was taking off a woman.  He was trying to get me to quit smoking.  That was one of his reasons.  He wanted me to quit smoking.  That was when we did the little quick tour, Boston, Washington, New York, obviously, and  Philly to see who could come up with the craziest, oddest thing.  Yeah.  You mean before people didn't have to pre-register and send an email?  Hi, I'm coming. 
[01:28:00]  What?  I'm coming.  I'm going to be there.  When people could just come down.  You mean when you didn't have to fucking put everybody through fucking retina screening  to get them into the studio?  Yeah.  Like now, it's like if they want to come up to the studio, write us an email and send  a self-addressed stamped envelope.  That's why I'll never respect any of these people, because they just don't get it.  They don't understand what this could be.  You might have to take a little bit of a chance with your own job, but why else are you here?  There's easier, safer jobs out there. 
[01:28:30]  Why are you in radio?  If you're not trying to take a little chance, you're in there.  And I already talked to Jimmy about this.  Yeah.  I do not want to be doing this broadcast in Chicago and have any management on the fucking  stage.  None.  I don't want them in my eyeline at fucking all.  They almost destroyed fucking Cleveland.  What do you mean?  Where they just stare at you?  They fucking look at you and make faces.  And give you that look of disapproval, like you brought home a bad report card. 
[01:29:00]  And in the middle of trying to just do shit and wing it and fucking have fun and be spontaneous,  you're looking over as they're making fucking like annoyed faces and trying to convey what  they think you should be doing and shouldn't be doing.  I don't want to see them during the broadcast.  I don't want to lay eyes on any of the fucking guys in management.  I didn't notice them at all.  Oh, God.  Right?  Dude, they were right when the guys were throwing the cherries for the cherry darts.  Right. 
[01:29:30]  I had to look at the guys throwing the cherry darts.  Yeah.  And do the commentary.  Yeah.  Right behind him.  Yeah.  There they were.  Yeah.  Larry, Moe, and Curly standing there fucking giving disapproving looks at everything.  They have to understand, like, I know you guys look out for the show, but the show is,  understand, you're not the target demo.  Like, you're not the fans we're trying to entertain.  Just fucking don't be there.  The fans had a great time at that appearance.  Yeah, I thought Cleveland was great. 
[01:30:00]  We don't need, uh, if management's having a ball, we're doing something wrong.  Right.  Exactly.  Are we allowed to have a beer or two without them looking at us?  Oh, God.  Sideways?  Like, it's another thing.  I just feel like, like, uh-oh.  Like, I'm going to be in trouble.  You know how old we are?  Leave us alone.  Stop it.  Fuck.  God.  Let us enjoy the last few weeks, months, or years, whatever it's going to be.  We've done this before.  Don't worry about it so much.  Fuck, man.  So, um, the point, to bring it all around, uh, Friday, we broadcast live from Chicago. 
[01:30:30]  Yes.  And we want to, you know, we want to kind of go a little old school with this, uh, oddest  thing you own.  Yeah, so bring it down.  There's a thousand dollar cash prize.  You've heard some of the shit that we've had.  We had a cancerous boob.  We had a freeze-dried monkey.  We had a guy with an ear from Vietnam.  We had a, something with a spleen.  I don't even know.  And then what was the other thing?  Cancerous breast.  Yeah, we, I said that.  Oh, did you say, um, yeah.  I don't remember what else.  Yeah.  Remember when we had the guys that had the, uh, what was it? 
[01:31:00]  Was it Stockbroker Dave?  Vasectomy?  Brought in the vasectomy tube.  Yeah.  That they cut out.  Yeah, we ate that.  And somebody put it on a cracker and ate it.  Yeah.  For Aerosmith tickets.  That's crazy shit.  For Aero.  Aero.  Aero.  Aerosmith.  Aerosmith tickets.  Yeah, I remember that, too.  Yeah.  That was terrific.  And there's also Chip Off the Old Block.  Yes.  The big chip contest.  And worst breath, judged by our own E-Rock. 
[01:31:30]  So he won't be wanting you to shut up.  Right.  He'll be wanting you to talk.  There's a $500 cash prize, just for your breath's stinking.  And the other thing, there's going to be money for that, too.  $1,000.  Nice, yeah.  Yeah, $1,000, man.  My favorite of all time, and the hardcore listeners have heard these stories way too  many times, but it was the clam chowder contest in Boston was the most unbelievable  thing I think we've ever done.  I think that's my number one.  Yeah.  Although the 55-gallon drum challenge was way the fuck up there. 
[01:32:00]  All these things that we obviously can't do.  That's the reason you don't hear this stuff is because we're just not allowed to do it.  Trust me, we would love to do all this stuff still.  But we had Super Bowl tickets, and we had a clam chowder eating contest.  We thought it would last a while, but we didn't do our research on that one.  People couldn't, they just couldn't eat a lot of it.  They couldn't eat a lot at all.  Before they started puking.  So then we decide, we came all the way to Boston for this.  We've got to do something.  So then we got another pair of tickets, and then we had guys pass around the puke bucket. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  And you had to take a spoonful of clam chowder puke, and if you puked again, then you were out.  But you had to puke back into that bucket.  And the last person that didn't puke got the other set of Super Bowl tickets.  We also did something similar at K-Rock.  Ugh.  With XM.  Which one?  When Ed fucking, with Pat from Monaki and Magoo started eating the fucking Cheerios puke. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, it's Fruit Lock.  Yeah.  That's one of the grossest things ever, was the way it was sticking and running.  And the smell of puke in the studio.  Sergeant Magoo, right?  The only place we can't do it is here.  Yeah.  Well, they know best, though.  They took us away from that.  We did it on K-Rock.  They took us away from that amazing environment and said, no, trust me, it'll be way better over here.  I mean, it's been okay.  I'm not going to complete it.  It's just the studio itself is awful.  But it's, we're just, we're very isolated here.  We're, you know, we're a show that have always been really close to the listeners and playing 
[01:33:30]  off their energy.  And they brought stuff every day.  And now it's almost impossible to get people up here.  Yeah, we have.  And then they're like, well, we could open up the fishbowl.  But then they only allow us to bring 12 listeners in.  And that makes it awkward because they have to go through some weird email slash screening  process.  And you can't just say, come down, we have to rent the fishbowl, or get the fishbowl  in advance.  It's just, you know what it is?  It's unspontaneous people expecting a radio show to be unspontaneous because they're not 
[01:34:00]  spontaneous.  It's terrible.  That part of it's terrible.  But I love the gig.  That part of it is maddening.  Yeah, it's too bad.  Because, you know, we do a good job just talking about shit every day.  But we had so much fun just fucking around with weird shit.  A lot of fun, yeah.  But Chicago's going to be great.  That I'm looking forward to.  Finally, I love getting out and doing these.  I love it.  We played those clips because I think a lot of people have forgotten what this show has  done in the past. 
[01:34:30]  And we are absolutely looking for some real crazy, odd shit in Chicago.  Yeah.  We really are.  And that's $1,000 once again?  $1,000.  $1,000 for the oddest thing you own or bring to us in Chicago.  Yep.  Okay?  This Friday in Marionette Park.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Marionette Park.  I got chills listening to that.  I was like, oh my God.  That's fine.  I remember we showed up to YSP and people were already there.  A couple hundred people just waiting for us to arrive.  That's great.  And then for the broadcast, it was just off the hook. 
[01:35:00]  Yo.  Oh, and the bomb.  My monumental bomb.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  I forgot.  The reason we went down there was to do the whole Kid Rock concert.  So there's the monkey blowing thing.  And we go out on stage, Ope Ant and myself introduce Kid Rock.  And I said, and Anthony remembers, I said, I didn't remember, I said, I must confess, but  I said to the crowd, I must confess, that was just me in a monkey mask.  Yeah. 
[01:35:30]  And it got a zero.  It got nothing.  In front of 5,000 people.  It was so bad.  Yeah, I remember that.  We were pretty cocky back then.  We just assumed that the entire city of Philly was listening to us that day.  That's when I came up with my rules for introing bands or doing anything from the stage.  Just do it.  All you got to do is mention the city that you're in.  And the band. 
[01:36:00]  And you got to curse.  Because once you curse, they love that.  And then the band that's coming on.  That's all you got to do.  How we doing, Philadelphia?  Yeah, how the fuck you feeling?  You want to see Kid Rock?  Yeah, that's all you got to do.  Well, he's going to be on stage in 20 minutes.  In 20 minutes.  Yeah, and you got to walk off all awkwardly.  Because radio guys are never allowed to actually introduce the band.  They give you that weird spot while they're resetting the stage. 
[01:36:30]  Walking the exact footprints I just did.  It's like in an old war movie where you walk up to the minefield.  And you got to walk exactly where they tell you.  Walk exactly where I tell you.  Don't touch the microphones.  I repeat.  Don't touch the mic or the stand.  Just stand there.  Intro the band.  Walk back off.  Watch these wires.  And tell them Kid Rock will be out in a little bit.  I always thought.  Because you never just go, Kid Rock!  And then it starts, you know.  I always thought introing the band 20 minutes before the band came up was the dumbest thing  ever.  Stupid.  But radio stations demand this shit. 
[01:37:00]  Because no one gives a fuck.  No one cares.  Because you're not doing anything.  You just...  And now, ladies and gentlemen.  It's so W-Y-S-P.  Right.  And it's so self-serving.  It really is.  No one cares.  No one cares in the end.  You got to be doing shit.  Ladies and gentlemen, I must confess.  Skitter Rock.  Someone help me with this one.  Spoonful of ear pus.  Someone had a leaky ear.  Was that in Philly, too?  Oh, God damn it.  I do remember that.  I think it was Philly.  I think someone had a leaky ear. 
[01:37:30]  And we were able to get a lot out of his ear.  Yeah.  And what?  People were eating it?  Or sniffing it?  Knowing us, I think they ate it.  I love when people sniff.  Because we went from eating to sniffing.  Because we weren't...  You're not allowed to ingest anything anymore.  Yeah.  I kind of get that one.  I don't.  They don't want to...  You don't know what kind of disease can be...  We've never...  So fucking disgusting.  We've never had a problem.  Oh, God.  Body parts.  We've never had a problem.  We've never had a problem.  Anthony, you wouldn't eat it?  Oh, my God. 
[01:38:00]  It was...  I couldn't even look.  I remember I couldn't look at it.  Yikes.  That's terrible.  Wiffle ball bat challenge.  Epic fucking management, this guy writes.  Well...  Can't do that, no.  That one...  Actually, we had a meeting and decided we had to retire that.  Because these girls just didn't understand their own limits.  They wanted to win.  They didn't understand their own limits.  Very competitive, those girls.  Oh, my God.  One was slamming it into another one's fucking vagina. 
[01:38:30]  I think she was topping out.  Yikes.  We can't blame management on that one.  We actually...  I think we gave an abortion that day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We actually decided, you know what?  It's time to retire that day.  Yeah.  The fucking bat came out and there was a fucking...  There was a life attached to it.  All right.  We'll break here.  Let's not forget.  Chris Rock coming in today.  I saw his new movie.  I liked it.  I didn't see it.  Where did you see it?  In the theater?  No, it's on demand.  One of those...  You can see it before it's in theaters movies. 
[01:39:00]  Oh.  Trying to get a buzz for the movie.  I liked it a lot.  A lot of dialogue.  I didn't see it.  A lot of French in the movie with some subtitles.  Really?  Who's in it?  Chris Rock.  Oh, but it's all French.  I didn't really recognize anybody else.  Okay.  But I guess they're big stars in France.  Basically, it's Chris Rock.  He lives in New York with his wife.  And his wife's family comes to visit for a few days.  I think it's called Two Days or something.  Two Days in New York?  Two Days in New York, yeah. 
[01:39:30]  I liked it a lot.  It was well written.  Oh.  I gotta see that.  I haven't seen it either.  I didn't know it was on demand.  What?  What's the matter, Edgar?  Baguettes make my teeth dry.  Baguettes?  French.  Oh, French.  Oh, boy.  I don't like fromage.  How could you not like fromage?  Makes my teeth dry.  Let's have some water.  I like to rub fromage on my teeth. 
[01:40:00]  Fromage.  We're going to talk about Dr. Drew next.  He has another success story.  We love pointing out his success stories.  Oh, yeah.  He's doing God's work for the people out there.  What a guy.  Also, Elton John hates Madonna.  Yeah.  He can't stop smashing that bitch.  Well, I want to know why.  If someone knows, please.  How did that all begin?  Oh, I know why he hates her now, but I don't know how it began.  I want to know how it began, because this has been going on for a while, and Matt Lauer 
[01:40:30]  in trouble for saying something that people should just say who gives a fuck, but I guess  he's in a little bit of a jam.  We'll explain next.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Very excited about our Chicago trip.  We leave tomorrow. 
[01:41:00]  We land all nice.  Do a couple things.  Broadcast live Friday.  Jimmy's show on Saturday.  Should be fun, fun, fun, I say.  Absolutely.  Jimmy's a little mad.  Where is he?  Is he discussing with somebody?  I think he went to take a leaky or something.  Yeah.  Maybe.  I don't know.  We got Chris Rock coming in at 920.  Oh.  We haven't had Chris Rock on in a while.  He's done a phoner here and there, right? 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  But he's going to be live in studio promoting Two Days in New York, Out Friday in New York  and August 17th, Limited.  What does that mean?  Limited.  Okay.  The week from Friday, it'll be in other cities.  I liked it.  I liked the movie a lot.  Two Days in New York.  Well written.  Here's Jimmy.  We're waiting for Jimmy.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  Are you frustrated today?  It's just, it's mind-boggling. 
[01:42:00]  I was telling the guys, like, everyone expects me to bitch and complain.  I understand.  And when I do, I also understand.  You don't have to tell me that it loses a bit of its luster.  But when Jimmy and Anthony bitch, it's my favorite thing.  And can Travis come in, too?  Because he'll at least be able to explain.  What's the problem, Jimmy?  I just, I didn't know that a lot of the crew isn't coming in until Thursday.  Until Friday?  I'm sorry, Friday.  We're going in Thursday night. 
[01:42:30]  We're getting there early, so, you know, we could settle in and, you know.  But they literally have guys landing, and I guess they did it in Cleveland, too, and going from the airport right to the venue.  Which I think is shitty to have to do.  But Sam...  Well, they're trying to save money.  Of course.  A couple hundred bucks.  Always.  A couple, you know, maybe a thousand bucks in the end they're trying to save.  Now, did they, Travis, did they give you a limited, they said to you, two people can go in the night before?  Yeah.  Two staff members. 
[01:43:00]  And you took yourself...  Yeah, me and someone else.  And Danny, because you guys are doing a walkthrough or a run-through?  Yeah, and Danny, technically, with walkthroughs, is very good at this kind of thing.  And you guys are, right, going over the technical stuff, which I get.  So, why would they have Sam, who's doing the pre-show, and they know he's going on the air, come in day of and land at 11 or 11.30?  I can't answer that question.  I don't know.  Like, how does that make sense? 
[01:43:30]  When literally, I just had seven hour delays going to Montreal.  Yeah.  And Troy and I going to Sabbath in Chicago.  I'm thinking two and a half hour delays.  I see someone coming down the hall.  Oh, he's marching down the hall.  No, Gary may have a valid answer.  I doubt it.  But my question is, why is Sam going in on Friday and not...  Oh, well.  We're trying to figure out, why is Sam going in Friday when he's doing the show? 
[01:44:00]  Because he chose to do that.  Huh?  The only...  Oh!  Sam, you're at a...  Let me tell you something right now.  You're at a crossroads in your career.  Here it is, right now.  Gary may have a reasonable explanation.  Sam, you said you wanted to come in Friday.  I didn't know there was a pre-show until yesterday, because nobody would tell me.  It was not confirmed until yesterday.  You're right there.  And when did I...  I didn't choose in Cleveland when I came in, or this time.  I never chose.  Oh.  I was given a plane ticket and said, this is when you're going. 
[01:44:30]  And I said, oh.  Wow.  That was it.  The only people who were told when to be there were Travis, myself, and Travis was  asked to, you know, find someone else so that we could do a walkthrough Thursday afternoon  and make sure everything was set up.  Everything else was, you know, up to the team as far as when they got in.  And it worked out in Cleveland for people to show up that morning.  So I think we followed that, but nobody was told to stay away.  You do realize there could be delays, though, right?  That's the issue I'm having, because Sam's doing the pre-show. 
[01:45:00]  So I think we didn't...  Maybe it was only confirmed yesterday, but I know that we've been saying the whole time  that Sam was going on earlier.  We just didn't know what time.  Yeah, at some capacity.  And is it safe to say if there's an hour delay, you're not going to make the broadcast,  Sam Roberts?  Well, again, at 1130.  An hour delay, you'd make it.  But again, if they're calling for thunderstorms, I normally would go, eh.  But I had over two-hour delays with Troy.  Maybe three-hour delays getting in the last week.  And that was just a mechanical difficulty.  I had seven-hour delays the week before.  Seven hours going into Montreal because of weather. 
[01:45:30]  So Sam, if he's doing the broadcast, should absolutely be there the night before.  Face to Sam, though.  Sam decided.  Well, I didn't choose.  You chose to fly in Friday.  And it's not up to me.  I should have done that.  I didn't...  Gary is saying that you chose this.  I'm saying it was definitely not handed down by me or anyone else.  I wouldn't have chosen it because I don't decide how many nights I stay overnight. 
[01:46:00]  Like, it's not up to me.  Wouldn't you choose to be there Thursday if it's Chicago?  That sounds like...  Of course.  It's not up to me how many nights...  Are you calling Gary a liar?  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Crossroads.  Yeah.  Oh, he blasted past that crossroad.  Did he ever.  You know what, though?  You're on the right road, though.  Congratulations, Sam Roberts.  I mean...  Fuck management.  Because it's not up to me how many nights I stay when we go in these places.  Nobody ever said you had two nights allotted to you or anything like that?  But why would I assume that I can be like, no, I think I'm going to... 
[01:46:30]  Then I'll go tonight, then.  Why not?  And I'll just see what's in Chicago.  I choose to go Wednesday.  So I'll get three hotel rooms.  Like, it's not...  It's never been...  I didn't choose the hotel.  I didn't choose the flight.  I didn't choose what time I was going.  I didn't choose your flight, either.  So, I mean, I...  So you're saying if I had gotten there, if I had said, no, I'm going to go Thursday.  Kenny worked with Travis and the rest of you on your flights.  Oh, it's Kenny and Travis.  I'm saying...  I think you're hearing the old pass the buck.  The old pass the buck routine. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, fuck.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Please keep my name out of this.  All right?  I'm trying to be diplomatic.  You don't want me to chime in.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  This is getting crazy.  Here's exactly what happened.  All right, Travis.  Travis.  When we started planning Chicago, I was asked to create a budget.  The first sentence of my budget was, assuming we do the exact same thing we did in Cleveland,  here is the budget.  Which was myself and Danny and you guys come in on Thursday and everyone else comes in on Friday. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, boy.  Okay, so...  Um...  Because when we did Cleveland, that's what I was told to do.  Sam coming in the day of is a ludicrous decision.  By whoever made it.  Whether it was Sam's stupidity...  Why would I choose...  Gary's flubbing or Travis's mismanagement.  Whatever it is.  Or the talent's lack of interest.  I mean, it's shitting on all the stupid...  But whatever the decision was for Sam, who's got to go on the air, it's a dumb, dumb move.  Especially going into the Midwest. 
[01:48:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  How long before the Cleveland show did you get in?  Hours.  All right.  You know, like enough time that I got back to the hotel, put my bags down.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, probably about an hour before we had to go to the venue.  I was able to take a shit.  Nice.  But an hour before the venue is crazy.  Chicago Airport is known for delays.  This is coming in from a freaking flyer.  I believe it's the busiest airport in the entire country.  O'Hare is the busiest... 
[01:48:30]  It gets a little clogged.  Well, because it's the middle of the country.  It's like you have a lot of connections going through there.  Mm-hmm.  It's the busiest airport in the country.  If it's my choice, then let's switch it and go on Thursday.  Let's ask the weasel.  Let's give him a chance, Gary.  Oh, my God.  Why are you blaming Kenny?  Oh, you are.  Are you blaming Kenny?  You are an anisticator.  Kenny did the booking.  I just want to give the weasel a chance.  Kenny didn't decide when to book their flights. 
[01:49:00]  Kenny just handled it for them.  Poorly, right?  No.  Oh, okay.  Kenny's really good at that stuff.  I'm kidding, Kenny.  Kenny does that for a living for Jimmy.  He's really good at that stuff.  Kenny's been very helpful.  Yeah, I don't think he's beaten.  Kenny?  Kenny, just comment.  Use your calm voice.  Certain people know what the truth is.  If they choose to say it, they should say it.  Whoa!  Very ambiguous.  Wow.  I guess that means back to the weasel.  Weasel?  Now, Kenny, what do you mean? 
[01:49:30]  In a diplomatic way.  I mean, use the mic right there.  Turn his mic on.  That was a very vague...  Usually Eric Vagel is the one that would say something like that.  But this is a no-win situation for me.  Were you told...  The Kobayashi Moron.  Were you told...  Oh, shit.  You didn't like to do kids.  No, no, no.  Okay.  No, no, no.  We're in the middle of this.  We can't go to break.  Okay.  We can't go to break.  You've got good instincts, though.  Let's go back to Cleveland. 
[01:50:00]  If we all remember correctly, there was an issue that Sirius wouldn't even pay for the  staff to stay an extra night.  Oh, right.  Remember that?  Okay.  Let alone come in a fucking day early.  But this time...  Your mic is crappy.  And Travis, you said just a minute ago...  Change mics.  Change mics, please.  You've got to be diplomatic.  I can't be fucking diplomatic.  Wait, wait, wait.  All right.  I'm in nature.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Well, then don't do it on the air.  It's just on nature.  Wait, what happened?  She's a blab!  What was he doing wrong?  No, you just...  You've got to explain it a certain way and lay it out. 
[01:50:30]  I'm a fucking bully.  I can't help it.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  But I mean, that's not the way to do it on the...  You don't worry about it.  I know.  I know.  It's my...  It's...  You just got to just...  It's not what you say.  It's how you say it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nice baby.  But there's a way to...  You know, Kenny only has one gear.  No, but I understand Kenny being frustrated.  That's what we love about him.  But it's like, you know, I want to hear it kind of laid out by everybody the same way. 
[01:51:00]  Breaking news.  O'Hare is the fucking worst.  Friday rush hour in Chicago starts at noon.  Sam will be late.  A lot of exclamation points.  This is from a nine to fiver.  You were...  A nine to fiver.  GFY71.  Thank you.  You were told one staff member could go with you.  Yeah.  I was told only one was needed.  So it wasn't my choice whether I was going Thursday or Friday.  No.  Everybody else goes Friday.  Sam, call Gary a liar.  I did already.  Right to his face.  Oh, shit.  Right to his face.  But what was it...  It'll be freeing.  Trust me.  Is it Gary lied or Gary just delegated to... 
[01:51:30]  And just didn't realize that this was going to happen?  Either there's horrible miscommunication, which is a possibility, or Gary's a liar.  Can I...  Can I...  Can I...  After hearing all this testimony, can I chime in and say something?  Sure.  What would be the big deal if one more guy, Sam Roberts, just flew in with everyone  else on fucking Thursday?  Why is it such a big issue?  It's not a big issue at all.  Then why was it not just done?  There shouldn't have been, let's fly him in on this day and this... 
[01:52:00]  Like, everyone just goes.  Like, Sam...  I'm sure Sam's not just going to be sitting in his room jacking off.  He could go down for the, you know, for them to walk around and see what he needs for  for the show and things like that.  Like, why not just throw everyone on a fucking plane?  It just seems easier.  When it was Cleveland and we were working together on when people were going in, that  was the plan that came together.  Oh, we don't work together.  Even Cleveland should have been the same then.  Like, one day.  Like, what is being saved? 
[01:52:30]  Money-wise.  Probably a thousand dollars.  What's being saved by Sam going the next day?  Not much.  Two hundred.  It can't be that much money.  Two hundred bucks.  That's a lot of money to some of us.  You know what?  I would absolutely, just out of principle, foot the fucking two hundred bucks.  Nobody's asking that.  I know no one's, but I would just because it's better for the show.  It's less stress and fucking bullshit for the show itself.  And we wanted to do some Chicago things and I'm learning, like, we have to do it by ourselves  because none of the guys are going to be there. 
[01:53:00]  Is...  Now, here's a question.  Some of that stuff we're going to talk about on the air.  Here's a question for Gary.  Gary, did anybody come to you at any point and indicate that, hey, maybe Sam or anybody  else should go in the night before or is this the first you're hearing it?  First.  So it's kind of hard to kill Gary if nobody said to him, look, this is an issue.  Well, that's true.  It's not like he said, I know it's an issue, so fuck you.  Travis.  He's hearing it for the first time now.  That's a mitigating fact. 
[01:53:30]  What does mitigating mean?  It's the opposite of aggravating.  Well, okay.  All right, so...  Mitigating means that's something in his favor.  Aggravating would be something against him.  So now the blame goes to Travis?  I wouldn't say it's blame.  I just think it's miscommunication.  I do what I'm told.  I'm told that two people come in on Thursday and everyone else comes in on Friday.  But, you know, you do what you're told and that's the ultimate decision.  Did you say at one point, well, look, Sam is doing the show.  It might make sense for him to come in the night before.  Or let's go and see if we can get that done. 
[01:54:00]  Okay, so that's the miscommunication.  I see what's going on here.  Travis didn't want to hang out with Sam on Thursday night.  But none of us do.  I mean, Sam's a fucking drag.  That's besides the point.  But the reality is...  Sam, how do you feel about that?  I mean, I'm somewhat of a drag, but not that big of a drag.  But I know how to have a little fun, right?  I know how to have a little fun.  I can loosen up a little bit.  I don't know why Kenny's holding back.  You can't kill him.  Who?  Gary, because unless someone came to him and said, look, we have to do this, and then he went, no.  But shouldn't Gary just know stuff? 
[01:54:30]  Yes, but if he delegates the responsibility...  How do you not know that maybe it would be a good idea to get Sam there early?  Just in case he does the pre-show.  Comment?  I have no comment.  You know what?  That's aggravated.  That's why no respect.  Listen, we could have said...  It's not mitigating.  Would it have been beneficial to send everyone early, both for this and Cleveland?  Sure.  Certainly.  Would have removed tons of potential obstacles, but Cleveland worked out very, very well, 
[01:55:00]  so we replicated...  Tons of obstacles.  Where did D-Rock come into this whole thing?  Yes.  He can't help himself.  What I'm hearing is Cleveland worked out very well, so let's take another chance at flight  delays.  Let it ride.  Let's let it ride.  Come on.  Roll them down.  Roll them bones.  And I would say we were lucky the first time.  Why are we chancing that again?  Luck doesn't go away.  Tell Sam to walk?  Oh, man.  It takes so fucking long.  Wait.  How far is the airport from the venue, too? 
[01:55:30]  It's...  800 miles.  I don't know.  I know that...  I can tell you exactly.  Kenny!  Kenny can tell you in nautical miles, feet, and as the curve flies.  All right.  O'Hare Airport to the venue is 35 miles or 50 minutes with no traffic, according to Google  Maps.  Oh, no.  So that's...  With traffic on Friday, that's probably an hour and 15 minutes.  35 miles.  How far is it from downtown?  Wait.  When is the plane landing?  11.07. 
[01:56:00]  And then you've got to get your bags and stuff.  You're not out of the airport until quarter to 12.  Sam's smart enough not to check bags.  I don't check bags.  He doesn't check bags.  But, so say, 11.06, I'm out of there 11.25.  You leave the airport by 12 o'clock.  The way it works is by the time they land...  O'Hare's a big airport.  Kenny, how far is it?  The plane lands.  That's not where it pulls up to the gate.  They don't drop you out over your hotel in a helicopter.  Yeah.  And you ain't fucking...  Planes are usually early.  And you sure as shit ain't by the door. 
[01:56:30]  No.  Unless it's a choice.  I wouldn't choose first class.  Well, you know, you had that choice.  You fucked it up.  Let me ask the weasel.  Weasel.  Is there a chance we could, like, work this out?  Yeah.  All right.  What are we going to do?  Well, switch Sam's flight.  Oh.  And I would like to choose to also stay at the Trump Hotel.  Eh, maybe not so much.  I didn't realize we had all his choices.  Oh.  Well, the choice with that would have been...  This is where the guys I wish had a choice.  Look, the Trump is more expensive because we are paying full price. 
[01:57:00]  It's like everybody else.  I mistakenly thought there was a discount or a corporate rate given.  I would have assumed, too, that something might have been worked out.  No, nothing.  Zero.  Zero.  But, you know, there was never...  It was requested and ignored.  And ignored.  Oh, shit.  Well, it's not like, you know, the person's name's on the bill.  Oh, that's right.  So, um...  Kenny, what are you holding back here?  Oh, man.  I really need to know.  Fucking tsunami of hatred.  I really need to know.  You don't have to hold it back, but just say it's smart.  I'm not saying...  Try to, like... 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, just speak to myself.  I'm a soldier.  I know you've been frustrated through this whole thing.  So what are you holding back?  I'm just waiting.  You want some more facts?  I got my papers.  He does have a lot of facts.  He really does.  They gave...  The choice was this.  To stay at the Trump was more expensive.  So, the staff is being put up at a hotel, which is less expensive, next to us.  Four blocks away.  Four blocks away.  So there was the option of the staff staying in the Trump if they were willing to share rooms. 
[01:58:00]  But Gary said, no, I don't think grown men should share rooms.  Which, all right.  I understand that.  But I would prefer them to be given the option to have shared a room.  And then go, look, I don't want to share a room.  Or, yeah, I'll be happy to just to stay closer.  So my answer there was, the company's not going to tell grown men to share rooms.  Right.  Right.  Okay.  It was, can anybody come to me and said, we'd rather share rooms?  That's a mitigating...  That's mitigating.  That is mitigating.  It's mitigating.  Was that proposed to the staff that that was an option? 
[01:58:30]  Oh, it's...  No, he doesn't want to propose that grown men sleep together.  No, he doesn't want to tell.  Grown men that they have to sleep together.  Oh, right, right.  But again, for Gary to have said that, somebody had to have mentioned it to him.  So, breaking news, construction on I...  I'm keeping it local for everyone, Ed.  Construction on I-294 is a bitch you're looking at major in capital letters delays.  Oh, no.  Sam, you're so not going to make the broad.  I love how people say this, and he'll be whisked to it.  It'll take 15 minutes. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, exactly.  He'll be there at 10.40 in the morning, early flight.  Hey, wait a minute.  I have a question, because I know Chicago.  How far, Kenny, is it from downtown, from where we usually stay, to the airport?  Because I can kind of gauge.  This is for crumbling papers.  Because from O'Hare to our hotel is 20 miles or 32 minutes with no time.  So, wait a minute.  The venue is 15 miles farther than downtown?  Yeah, it's further south.  It's towards where your venue is.  Oh, you didn't know that?  No, because it takes, in Chicago traffic, it's a motherfucker, that road, minimum 45 to 
[01:59:30]  50 minutes to get from the airport to downtown where the hotels are.  Jim, may I lighten everybody with another fact?  Please do, Kenny.  From our hotel to the venue is 21 miles or 39 minutes with no traffic.  Jesus.  Okay.  As far as the Google Maps.  Okay, 20 miles.  That's far, but we're staying kind of where we want to stay downtown.  So, that's our choice.  We could have stayed in the shitty place near the venue. 
[02:00:00]  Is that our choice?  Yeah, we wanted to stay in downtown Chicago.  Did we have choices?  Yeah.  I like it.  We wanted to pop it up, have some deep dish, you know, do Chicago shit.  So, that's a big risk with him getting there on time, honestly, with the weather.  Everyone's saying he's not going to make it, but, breaking news, put Sam on the CTA train  blue line, have him transfer downtown to the Orange Line to Midway, take a taxi to Bourbon  Street.  Oh, well, that sounds very convenient.  Then you might make it.  I didn't realize that was one of the choices.  That's one of your choices.  Oh, I have no idea.  It's all up to you.  No clue. 
[02:00:30]  My destiny was in my own hands the whole time.  This whole thing is up to you.  Sam, has there been some lying going on here today?  Well, we covered the lying.  Oh, I want to make sure we covered the lying.  I think it's been made clear that I didn't make any, I didn't not make any choices.  I didn't make any choices improperly.  I was presented with what I thought were facts.  You have free will.  Did you know you were going on the air?  You assumed.  Yeah, well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.  You knew in some capacity you would be on the air.  Of course.  In all likelihood, absolutely.  Sam's mistake was, while you didn't choose it, you should have said to somebody, look, 
[02:01:00]  this doesn't make sense for me to be coming in day of.  Right.  Is there anything we can do?  And then if you're told no, then whoever said no can be the target of the rest.  Right.  But it's harder if we don't know it.  The problem is that there's so many people above me making these decisions.  I don't understand why everything that comes up, I always am told I didn't ask.  Well, no, no.  But I mean, in any situation with all of us.  It's really hard to squeak anything.  Oh, man.  Breaking news.  You have to ask, though, because a lot of times people are just making decisions and 
[02:01:30]  there's a miscommunication.  Do we have more updates from Chicago?  Yeah.  Speaking of decisions, this one is for the weasel.  Is Sirius homophobic with this grown men can't share room stance?  Ah, this is like Chick-fil-A right here.  Now, this is a Chick-fil-A.  We ought to all get together for a kiss-in in front of the hotel with chicken sandwiches.  We're in the rooms and chicken sandwiches, too.  That sounds pretty good.  By the way, I want my KFC.  Sam should fly into Midway Airport. 
[02:02:00]  Fly southwest to Midway Airport.  Do not go through O'Hare.  The bar is 20 minutes from Midway.  O'Hare way farther.  That's correct.  I didn't know that was correct.  Kenny goes, that's correct.  Kenny, was there ever a choice to fly into Midway?  What was the choice?  Midway was not a viable option as far as flight.  Flight availability, I would assume.  Yeah, O'Hare's got many more options.  Yeah.  Whose decision was that?  Midway is halfway.  Am I right or wrong?  All right, we'll be right back.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[02:02:30]  Now people are sending me traffic pictures from Chicago.  Oh, no.  Andy, that was my decision.  Live traffic pictures from Chicago.  When I make a decision, I stick by the decision.  You stick by it?  Right or wrong.  And you take responsibility for it.  Exactly.  What are you trying to say by saying that?  That's Kenny.  There's something going on there.  I just.  You're covering up something.  You're frustrated.  What happened?  It's better to make the wrong decision than no decision.  So if someone didn't make a decision in this room?  Well, and as long as we got them on the ropes.  Oh, right. 
[02:03:00]  How does Sirius feel about paying for the transportation for the staff to attend the anti-social comedy show Saturday?  Oh, that was a little odd, too.  Wait, what happened there?  What happened there?  Well, I hear tell.  I was approached with a proposal to pay for the transportation for the staff to go see Jimmy's show on Saturday because I was informed that Sirius XM would not be paying for transportation for the boys to join us and Jimmy Norton at the venue to see Jimmy's show. 
[02:03:30]  Well, we can stay the extra day, but we can't get there.  Well, pitch, motherfucker.  It's your choice.  Well, Sirius has this thing.  When you're done with why you're in that city, then they have no more responsibility to you.  True?  That's the company's policy, I think.  Once the show is over, that's it.  Yeah, I think we bent it to take care of an extra night hotel room, and I'm sure we can work something out of it. 
[02:04:00]  Do you think it's a good faith gesture?  They don't understand good faith, that Sirius XM said on radio.  I don't know.  It just seems like it's good.  We're all going to be hanging out and talking, and it translates to material for on air.  It definitely does.  Get all these guys' different takes on the antisocial tour, the casino.  It's just going to be a great thing.  It's great fodder.  Right.  Yeah, mother, too.  No, no, no, no.  You guys don't know good timing.  Yeah, we don't.  Anthony, breaking news. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  O'Hare is not the busiest airport in the U.S.  Hartsfield in Atlanta is.  O'Hare is number two.  I stand corrected.  It used to be.  And Trucker Peevo writes, Chicago traffic sucks just like their football team.  Oh, come on.  Now let's just get it personal.  Atlanta is a, I hate that airport.  That's a big airport.  Yeah.  The train.  You've got to go way up the escalator and then way down the escalator.  I do believe that the advent of private postage, you know, that whole thing with FedEx and UPS, 
[02:05:00]  has made Atlanta a busier airport than O'Hare.  Because a lot of that is commercial traffic?  Yes, I do believe, yes, more commercial traffic in Atlanta.  I didn't realize.  If we're just blurting out half-assed facts.  So now what?  Well, it's, you know, let's have a solution for once.  I think the solution should be young Sam Roberts can go fuck himself. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, without a doubt.  And not even be there.  Wow.  Or, but why penalize?  Sure choice.  So now three guys come in on Thursday, right?  I pick to not fuck myself.  Or one guy has to not come in on Friday.  Iraq, how does it feel to be so useless and unneeded that we don't give a shit when you get in?  Iraq, he's actually landing at 8 p.m. on Friday.  Iraq, you going?  Yeah, I'm going.  I didn't even know.  No one cares.  No one gave a shit.  That's not true, Iraq. 
[02:06:00]  You were next.  I mean, just because Sam was on air, your plans were being handled next.  When are you arriving?  Same time.  That's fine.  You'll be fine.  The same plane from Operation Dumbo Drop.  Why don't you get, hey, Eric, why don't you get to Chicago and shut up?  Yeah.  Good fucking comeback.  Yeah, yeah.  Why don't they come back here and shut up?  Ah, that's good.  Adding the local flavor.  So Sam goes in Thursday now.  So who doesn't get to go in Thursday? 
[02:06:30]  Roland Troyner.  Because I know how this company works.  Iraq?  Who else?  Roland Troyner.  Roland Troy?  No.  I mean, is Danny and Travis still coming in Thursday as well?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, our flights are better.  Oh, that's nice, yeah.  Yeah, we should have the Three Stooges coming in on the same day.  Yeah.  Are you calling me Sam?  It's out of love.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Two Stooges and the Stooges.  Because you like the movie so much.  Yes, G.H.  Who's to blame here, sir?  We love, like, listing everyone.  Jesus, he's burning.  It's a burning hole. 
[02:07:00]  Who's to blame?  Start with the least blame to the most blame.  I will take the blame.  Oh, look at that.  He's such a martyr.  He's such a martyr.  Oh, Kenny.  Oh, Kenny.  Oh, Kenny.  Oh, Kenny.  They know not what they do.  Neither do I.  Obviously, I can't do anything right.  How many times have you heard Kenny say that?  Not enough.  Come on, Kenny.  List to blame.  We love this game on the show.  Yeah, he still needs to make the list so he can find out who comes in second. 
[02:07:30]  I'm sure Sam has no problem doing the list, but Kenny?  No, I will fall on the sword.  Sam, list to blame here.  My list?  Yeah.  Well, is O.B. Anthony Jim tied for last?  Yeah!  For once, I'm not to blame.  I like that.  He means importance and on-air personalities in this company.  That's a fair point.  And then I would say my list would be me.  Oh.  From the bottom.  Because it was your choice.  Oh, from the bottom. 
[02:08:00]  From the bottom.  So you're innocent.  I'm not a martyr.  Me.  The least to blame.  Absolutely least to blame.  Yeah.  I'm almost in your neck of the way.  You're just handed a ticket.  I'm not happy that you were called a liar.  Was he?  Yeah, I think so.  All right.  It was inferred.  It was definitely inferred.  Thank you, Sam.  Me.  Least to blame.  Then Kenny is the next least to blame.  Really?  Travis agrees.  I think so.  I know exactly what his list is going to be.  I put Kenny even below Sam.  Kenny was just trying to do the right thing the whole time, but was frustrated because 
[02:08:30]  half the time no one even wanted to talk to him.  Kenny just does what they allow him to do or what they tell him or what we ask him to do.  Which is too bad because that's what he does for a living.  Yeah.  I put him on a zero blame list.  Kenny?  I'm like orders.  I like to give them and get them.  So, yeah.  So, me, Kenny, we're kind of both very low on totem narrative.  I know, but Kenny's a little lower than you.  Well, I mean, that's perspective.  Sam has a tough time with that.  No, I know.  But Kenny is simply the messenger.  And like anything they tell Kenny to book, he'll book. 
[02:09:00]  Kenny didn't know that Sam was doing a pre-show.  Sam knew that he was doing it.  Yeah, absolutely.  And it's not, in all fairness, it's not Kenny's responsibility to make those calls.  Kenny can only give us facts, but Kenny doesn't make those decisions.  He just does what they tell him to do.  Breaking news.  Breaking news.  Sorry.  If Howard Stern was going to Chicago, they would have been there last week with limos for everyone.  Is that true, Gary?  And a private plane.  And a private plane.  That's true.  Is that true, Gary?  It's got to be true.  I don't work with that show. 
[02:09:30]  I don't think he travels much.  And how do you feel about Howard Stern suing the company?  No comment.  Big, huge article in the paper.  Why would you ask that question?  Oh, that has nothing that's irrelevant.  Right, Kenny?  Isn't that called irrelevance?  And immaterial.  Immaterial.  He's trying to get $300 million more from this company.  How do you feel about that, Gary?  I'd like a little piece of that.  Yeah.  Fair comment.  That means he's going to join a lawsuit.  So then what?  Travis is next, Sam?  I will place Travis next.  Nice. 
[02:10:00]  And then topping the list would indeed be Gary.  Oh, wow.  Gary.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  I like that attitude.  It's great to be number one at something.  Behind the scenes, Gary, behind the scenes, will you be yelling at Sam today for being  cocky?  Oh, man.  Off the show.  Travis is just nodding his head yes.  Come on, Travis.  Will Sam be getting a talking to?  No.  I will approach Gary myself after the show. 
[02:10:30]  Do I think Sam should have stepped up and said, hey, I think it would be better for myself  in the show if I came early?  Absolutely.  I do.  I do.  I have a little more blame than Sammy Roberts is putting on himself.  Would I have to ask once a week?  Once a week?  Well, he has to ask for his raise once a week.  That was a lot.  That was the last one that I had to come to that with.  We're trying to move on from that, but the fact does remain that the reason why Sam doesn't  make a lot of money is he doesn't ask for his raise.  Let me ask something.  Let me just throw this into the works here. 
[02:11:00]  Yes.  Sam, you don't think that in some capacity, when given the ticket to arrive in Chicago  and you know, in fact, that you will be doing something on the air before our show, that  you wouldn't think maybe you should say something to them and say, you know, maybe I should go  the night before.  Is there any way?  Why wouldn't you approach them with that?  Because my desire to approach them trying to get some sort of credit for what I do or 
[02:11:30]  fair treatment for what I feel is right or anything.  Don't bring up other instances.  This instance.  This instance.  Because I'm tired of going to them and asking them for stuff.  But how about us?  This is for stuff for the show.  It's not really asking.  This is a show.  This isn't a gift to you.  This isn't a gift to you.  That's not plausible, Anthony.  Why is that?  It's always not plausible.  You hear what he said there?  It's not a gift.  Meaning this is you asking for the show.  If I give you a raise, that would be a gift.  Not what you're deserved.  I heard that shit.  I heard that shit from the way you are.  That is good.  You are a lawyer.  Welcome.  That is good.  But you're saying that... 
[02:12:00]  And there are enough people that are above me that this decision shouldn't be mine.  But don't you know best as far as what time you need and where you should be at any  given point?  I don't ultimately make the decisions, but believe me, I'm aware of my travel.  I'm aware of when I'm going and everything.  But there's no one that's above you.  All the other is.  I can't make them, as much as I could yell and scream at Gary or Steve, I can't make them  fly me.  But you are in a position of power.  If they told us we were flying in on Friday afternoon, I would be like, what? 
[02:12:30]  Are you insane?  We are also in a position of power.  But you could still raise the point to Travis, and Travis should have raised the point.  But you're missing the point from Sam, in all fairness.  He's sick of asking for shit, because it never happens.  But I understand it happens a little bit, to be fair, but not enough.  It does happen sometimes.  I understand that.  And it's not even...  I'm not saying that Gary doesn't do anything.  I'm not blaming Gary.  But the way everything is set up here is that asking for things becomes a very arduous 
[02:13:00]  process and a tiring process, not even denying it.  And it gets to the point where you have beaten down multiple bosses above you, and you get  something, and you say, okay, if this is what you guys think is right, fine.  But if we're in a position of power, why didn't you come to us and just go, look, I'm going  in.  Because of the way the companies are, it's an annoying corporate structure.  Believe me, we hate it, too.  But that's the way...  This is a much more corporate-run thing.  So when things are frustrating, we have to deal with them a certain way. 
[02:13:30]  Why wouldn't you have come to Ope, Ann, or myself and said, look, or Travis and said,  look, it would be a lot smarter if I was in there, because, you know, these fucking corporate  idiots are not going to do it.  I should be in there, because I'm fucking doing this gig.  And then let the company say no, and then we can kill them.  But they didn't say no to you for that.  Oh, boy.  More blame for Sam.  More often than not.  Kenny wins.  Less blame for Kenny.  It's just, at this point...  Give it up, Sam.  I would rather...  There's so many people who could be making these decisions. 
[02:14:00]  I get the paper, and just what I said a minute ago, I'd rather say...  You shouldn't have put Sam on the stand.  Okay.  As long as...  If you think this is right, then this is right.  You're incriminating yourself.  Well, you know, not even position of power.  I never allow stuff to the best of my ability to be run like that.  Even if I lose the point, I'll always at least be aware of it and try to get...  You know what I'm saying?  Like...  Yeah, but you guys are also in positions where you are the one... 
[02:14:30]  This is your event.  Yeah, but if you brought this to our attention, saying it's better for the show if I'm there  early...  Like, give them the chance to say no.  Give them the chance to say no.  Sam, you have to concede this point.  Ah, you gotta concede this point.  If you would have said that, even though you're technically right, Sam's right to go, why  would I have to do that?  And it's a frustrating process.  Right, right, right.  Okay, okay, okay.  I'm not saying that it wouldn't have helped.  I'm saying I'm tired of having to do it every time.  Okay.  That's what I'm saying.  The reason I didn't do it is not because I didn't think it would help.  It's because I'm tired of every time there's something that makes sense, I have to say 
[02:15:00]  something.  But that's...  You're looking at a company issue, and now Gary said to Travis, who do you gotta bring  a guy?  Who are you bringing with you?  Now, I understand why Travis chose Danny, because they're doing a walkthrough.  But it's not like Gary should go, alright, Travis, you're bringing Danny, what about...  Travis, he's going by the thing like, hey, this is what my exec producer told me.  I think what Sam's saying, though, there's some incompetence going on here.  Yeah, but another thing is, what if we all said, oh, we're tired, let's all just give  up.  What would happen then? 
[02:15:30]  Oh, man.  We have the show we have now.  We'd be exactly where we are.  What's happened?  The channel would exist as it does.  Yes.  What happened in November of 04?  Sam, you're losing in the blame game.  I think we gotta give it to Kenny.  At least the blame.  I understand Sam's frustration, though, because a lot of the time here, there is that air of  when something like this comes up, and ultimately the blame is placed on Sam, it's like, well, 
[02:16:00]  there's a lot of people above Sam, and that make more than Sam, and that make more than  me, et cetera, that they'll just say, well, you should have caught that.  Congratulations to Travis.  He just got himself an hour meeting after the show.  Yeah.  But I share the same thing.  The same thing has happened to me.  But in this business, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to carry off.  I apologize.  But in this business, this is different than an office structure.  It's a weird thing.  What we're doing is as a creative...  We chose this business.  We should...  We should...  I never asked why Mo Green flew in on Friday. 
[02:16:30]  But, yeah, we should catch that.  Like, that is our...  I don't rely on other...  I mean, I do, but I try to catch people's fuck-ups all the time.  It's like, I don't just stay on my manager and go, well, hey, how come this didn't happen  two weeks ago?  I call him up and go, what's going on with this?  I think everybody is way better at catching other people's fuck-ups than their own.  You know, like, I'll totally concede that, yeah, like, you know what, maybe I should  have said, hey, maybe we should have Sam coming on.  No, no, no, Travis. 
[02:17:00]  I should have had the intuition to know that and figured it out.  Uh-oh, that means something's going on there.  No.  Kenny?  I take the blame.  Kenny is trying to take blame that doesn't belong on him.  Yeah, Kenny likes to be spanked.  Yeah, I just saw Chris Rock.  Kenny's a big weirdo.  Chris is going into shape.  But we got it...  Who is...  Oh, Chris, you have...  Okay.  When we...  When we analyze this shit, we got to just look at it accurately and fucking, you know,  take the hit for what our part in it was.  Because if we just irrationally blame, you know, Creepy Gary, no offense, it's... 
[02:17:30]  Then it just...  You know what I mean?  If he had said no, you can't do that, I don't care.  Oh, then we could unload.  I'd be fucking killing him right now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But even...  You know what I mean?  E-Rock comment?  E-Rock, what do you feel about this whole thing?  You're involved.  Wait, E-Rock's really going to Chicago?  Yeah.  I'm not important enough to be involved in that.  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy, I'm supposed to feel sorry for you now.  Oh, E-Rock. 
[02:18:00]  So, Gary, how does Sirius feel about treating the staff to a ride to the show Saturday?  Hmm.  Yeah, why is that a problem?  How much could that possibly...  Well, we don't know if it's a problem yet, because in all fairness to Gary...  We never approached that.  Right.  It was just assumed based on past practice.  He's bringing up past practice.  But now, since, you know, the cards are on the table, will Sirius pay for the staff to go to the show?  Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. 
[02:18:30]  What, are we talking about a van?  Are we talking about individual limousines?  What are we talking about?  No, no.  It's Chris Rock.  Swear, he's looking out the window.  A round-trip van.  Is Chris Rock ready to come in here?  No, he's doing part of shade now.  If it's a choice, individual limos.  There you go.  If it's a choice.  Yeah, good fucking luck with that.  You got a better shot at getting...  Oh, something.  I don't know.  What the heck?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Gary, I got a question.  Holy Jesus.  If we were suing the company, would we be doing a radio show today, Chris?  Oh, boy. 
[02:19:00]  I just need to know.  I just need to know where we stand with the company.  It's a little more of an abstract question.  Hypothetical.  Yeah, a little hypothetical.  Should we be expecting a lawsuit?  Hypothetically, if we were suing the company, would we be allowed to still broadcast,  like others?  No, I'm not a lawyer.  I have no idea.  See?  He's not in that capacity.  I'm just wondering.  You know who's not?  I'm just wondering how powerful we are.  You know who we should throw in this blame game, who we're not even mentioning?  Please say E-Rock.  Do we?  E-Rock just kind of...  He's kind of...  Can he be everyone...  The cancer that runs through the entire thing, which makes it this way to begin with? 
[02:19:30]  Can he be everyone just punching back?  He's the reason we lost the merger.  Can you turn him into a piñata?  So everyone can feel good about themselves.  Yes, and just incompetence and sadness falls out when you hit him with a fucking scale.  One thing I like, too, on the after show, I love when E-Rock...  E-Rock has a lot of music cues on the after show, depending on what's happening and stuff.  And we get none whatsoever during a little conversation.  Maybe a song that's appropriate for, you know, some kind of blame song would have been nice to play in the back. 
[02:20:00]  But no one...  Oh, my God.  Yeah, he didn't add anything to this.  Well, he doesn't listen to your show.  He's got all kinds of shit going on in there.  He's got fan fictions.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fantasy stuff for SummerSlam.  But I noticed during your show, there's like a bevy of, like, everyone's arguing about something  and E-Rock's just popping music cues in.  Oh, man, because he really is motivated.  No, he's motivated.  He's confident.  He feels good about being part of that show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's monitoring Scott and Todd right now, isn't he?  Yeah, he is. 
[02:20:30]  Do we have a sponsor for this event?  Steven Singer.  Oh, Steven Singer is part of it.  That's who we've got to blame.  Anthony, why don't you tell him who to sponsor him?  No, no, no, but I'm saying part of the problem is...  But just hang on.  Anthony, you can tell him.  Well, you know, we're coming to Chicago.  What?  For the first time ever.  And come be a part of it.  We're going to broadcast live from 115 Bourbon Street in Marionette Park.  Doors will be opening at 2 p.m.  And the show starts at 3 p.m. Central Time.  That's central.  Do the math.  You've got to be 21 or older. 
[02:21:00]  Get there early, unlike Sam Roberts, because space is limited.  Details are at SiriusXM.com slash Opie and Anthony.  One word, please.  Brought to you by Steven Singer Jewelers.  The best sponsor we've ever had, I think.  Oh, please.  Please, visit IHateStevenSinger.com.  Oh, there was a jizz company that was pretty good.  No, I'm not saying the tastiest sponsor.  I'm saying the best sponsor.  But part of it is...  Stupid Tim Savion bringing his French company to our show.  Oh, that was great.  We just got this sponsored. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  That's why they said do the Cleveland thing, because part of it is that sales...  And I don't even know who...  I don't know if I've ever met anyone at sales.  Remember in fame, Soupy Sales is going to be at that party.  You are going to sing at that party.  Remember the old Jewish mother?  But part of it is the company is just footing the bill to send us there.  And this is in Cleveland, I think.  There was no sponsorship there, right?  Do we have anybody?  I was in Steven Singer there, too.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, Steven, they got...  But the sales department doesn't bring a lot of sponsorship money. 
[02:22:00]  They don't get us different sponsors.  So it's like up until yesterday or whatever, or a week ago, the company is paying for us  to go to Chicago.  So it's like part of it is sales not giving...  It's like if we had sponsors, this would be a lot easier to get shit done.  Oh, yeah.  That's a part of it, too.  Gary, what's wrong with the sales department at SiriusXM?  What are they such a comment?  Let's take a note from Kenny here.  I'm going to be diplomatic and just say I work in programming.  Oh!  Boo!  See, here's the thing.  Boo!  No one really wants to butt heads and communicate in different departments. 
[02:22:30]  So it's like we're all working for different companies.  Yeah, it's like the European Union, basically.  Yes.  The whole thing's fucking fun.  And poor Sam is Greece.  Just taking all the fucking blame for his incompetence.  And loving ass sex.  Gary, how many people today at SiriusXM are ignoring the big article about Howard Stern  suing the company for $200 million as he continues to broadcast for this fine company?  Oh, jeez.  Which we like, actually, in the end.  Huh?  How is it down the hall?  Everyone's just making believe that article's not huge in the paper today?  Oh, boy. 
[02:23:00]  Down the hall, it's just music programming, mostly.  Is it?  Yeah.  Just programming.  Is Scott Greenstein getting one of his lackeys to cut that article out of every newspaper  today?  How many lackeys does he have?  He does have a lot of lackeys.  Isn't fucking Zito a lackey?  Oh, yeah, he is.  He figures.  I'm going to give Gary a compliment.  At least you don't have tight pants, like Scott Greenstein.  Why would you say that?  So he got that going for you.  I'll take any compliment I can get.  You know why he doesn't have tight pants.  Very small cock.  No.  Oh, wow.  That's the man with a gigantic cock. 
[02:23:30]  Only a man with a gigantic cock throws himself under the bus.  You got a big piece?  I'll kick Confucius.  Can we throw blueberries at your nicely pressed shirt?  Jesus.  I already had to change shirts once today.  Oh, you did?  I spilled on it.  What did you spill?  He spilled an eagle.  What was his name?  Hey, so you have another really nice shirt just standing by?  That was before I left.  Oh, that's...  Oh, all right.  You spilled at home?  Oh, for a good start.  No, but...  It's only gotten better since then, let me tell you. 
[02:24:00]  No.  Oh, see, that's the article we're all supposed to ignore today.  Oh, look at him.  It's a good picture.  Wow.  Jesus.  What's going on with him?  Yikes.  But I think we...  There's a lot of other things you guys want to talk about.  Yeah, we need an answer for the staff transportation.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  We'll figure it out.  Bottom line here is...  Let's work out on that and the Sam flight change.  Sam Roberts flight change.  Well, it looks like you're going to be busy.  You better get to it now.  We need Sam Roberts flight change. 
[02:24:30]  And we need to find out if these young lads will be having transportation to go see Jimmy  Norton and the social fucking shitwoods.  Yeah, plenty of seats available.  Believe me.  Oh, no.  Come on.  Guys can spread out and enjoy.  No.  No, really?  Oh, by the way, you guys aren't allowed anywhere near the...  Ant, tell them.  You're not allowed to be anywhere near the stage for the live broadcast.  Oh, that's another thing.  You probably heard that, right?  Sorry.  All management.  Sorry.  Yeah, we don't want any management there.  And I got to tell you, I'll be honest, you were the most fun guy in Cleveland. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  It's a pretty low bar, though.  Yeah, it is a very low bar.  You also narrowed down exactly who you're talking about by a lot.  You just narrowed it down by a third.  You really did.  I'm not going to mention it.  We don't want anybody there fucking avoiding Big Ethel on the stage.  Archie's comic joke.  Oh, that's so funny.  Yeah, well, you know, my back hurts.  I think that was a...  My teeth hurt from that one.  Yeah, mine too.  That was good.  Oh.  And Gary tried something in Cleveland. 
[02:25:30]  What was it again?  Prostitute?  With Jonathan.  Goat?  Oh, yeah, I ate goat.  Oh, yeah, I ate goat.  It wasn't the first time.  Yeah.  I was going to say something there.  Oh, ate goat?  Yeah, it was a crow line, but...  Well, he does.  An eating crow line?  Yeah.  I decided not to.  Fucking auntie.  I know.  Eat crow.  Have some humble pie, why don't you?  You're too wrong.  Don't make a right.  I don't like that type of language.  It's cold in here.  There's my hands. 
[02:26:00]  What an idiot.  Could you go now, please?  All right.  That's not the way you...  All right.  Wow, he wasn't invited in here.  He came in here.  You know what?  I do respect that you came in, though.  He came in.  I'll give you the respect for coming in, and your pants aren't too tight.  See, I'm good.  Andy, I think you did a good job.  I do, too.  I do, too, explaining stuff without getting anyone involved.  Sam, I'm good with him now.  Oh, man.  He's not good with you.  I don't care, but I'm good with him.  You just spent 40 minutes insulting him. 
[02:26:30]  No, I didn't.  Kenny, could you get one of these fucking dirtbag interns to get me a cup of ice?  I'll tell you who's not going to Chicago.  These asshole interns.  That's right.  I gotta pee desperately.  Why don't we do that?  We'll take a break.  I saw Chris Rock walking into Sheed 45.  He should be here in a few minutes.  And we still gotta do the Dr. Drew thing and some other stuff.  Get us to a break room.  The headline here is a live broadcast Friday in Chicago. 
[02:27:00]  Go.  Hopefully a lot of people show up.  Including me.  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Is this us?  We're back.  We're gonna have Chris Rock at studio in a few minutes.  Two days in New York.  He's out Friday in New York at August 17th.  Limited meeting.  A few other cities around there.  Around America.  I'm annoyed I didn't know about that.  I didn't realize that you could see it. 
[02:27:30]  Because they're doing that now on demand.  Where you can see these movies before they're in theater.  Oh, I enjoy that.  I like that.  It's a good movie, man.  I liked it.  You know why I did that recently with an Orlando Bloom movie called The Good Doctor?  Yeah.  That was the movie I was thinking of.  Oh.  There was not anything believable about it.  Really?  Oh, really?  Utter dreck.  Yeah, it must have.  Terrible.  No one knows about that movie, right?  No.  But I mean, completely unbelievable relationships.  And that was the only time I've watched something before it was in theaters. 
[02:28:00]  I watched the original Bad Lieutenant last night.  It's just so fucking good.  Fucking Keitel crying.  In church?  Yeah.  I watched that scene on YouTube recently.  It's awesome.  It's fucking...  The whole movie's great.  To be so patient...  It's gonna go seven games.  I just kept thinking of Jay Moore doing that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When he's fucking...  When he's screaming about Daryl Strawberry and fucking shoots his fucking gun into the radio.  Oh, man.  He shoots his radio.  He is so fucking pissed that that thing could not win. 
[02:28:30]  Like, he just knows everything is lost.  He's done.  He fucked up.  Oh, man.  Yeah, it's such a good movie.  Couple of beautiful girls.  Could we squeeze the Elton John clip in real fast?  Elton John.  Elton John hates Madonna.  This has been going on for a while, I guess.  Does anyone know how this started and why?  Because he's a catty little bitch.  I don't know.  He is, right?  Yeah.  It comes across that way.  I mean, if any guy doesn't like Madonna, he just goes, eh, fuck her.  I think he was just asked. 
[02:29:00]  But he just got like, meow.  I think he was just asked about Madonna by...  This isn't the first time he has said shit about her.  No, but because they've got...  He has a history of not liking her.  So I think this is just the latest in...  Yeah.  I just want to know how it started.  It's all catty stuff.  Yeah.  And right now, anyway, I don't know if it's how it started, but right now he thinks that  he's very...  Gaga...  Lady Gaga is his son's godmother.  And he thinks that Madonna has treated Gaga very shittily.  He's right.  So...  Yeah, but no one cares about Gaga anymore.  What?  That's not true.  You're fucking off your rocker. 
[02:29:30]  She's still really, really popular.  I love her.  Drops.  Oh, Lady Gaga?  Gaga.  Love her.  I think she's great.  She's the best.  Love.  Her.  Love her.  Gaga.  Yes.  Here's Elton John.  In happier days, Elton and Madonna hammed it up for all the cameras.  Is this what I have to do to sell records?  Oh, please, yeah.  Now they're embroiled in a bitter feud.  She's such a nightmare. 
[02:30:00]  Sorry.  She's...  Her career's over.  I can tell you that.  Her tour's been a disaster.  And it couldn't happen to a bigger...  If Madonna had had any common sense, she would have made a record like Ray of Light, stayed  away from the dance stuff, and just been a great pop singer, make great pop records, which  she does brilliantly.  But no, she had to prove that she was like...  And she looks like a f***ing fairground stripper.  She's been so horrible to Gaga.  Well, Gaga did rip her off.  Yeah. 
[02:30:30]  But even before that...  Gaga ripped her off, so...  She was influenced by her.  I don't think she ripped her off.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a difference.  I'm not going to win with Team Gaga.  What's a fairground stripper or something?  I guess it's like a...  A stripper and a fairground.  It's a low-level stripper.  I've never heard of one of those.  It's bad enough to be called a stripper, then a fairground stripper, I guess, is even worse  than that.  What the hell is that?  But I've never heard fairground stripper.  Where's that queen seeing that?  There's a difference...  Jesus.  ...between being influenced and copying.  Oh, my God.  You could be influenced by somebody without copying them.  That is such a copy.  Yeah.  She ripped off one of Madonna's songs. 
[02:31:00]  Same way she was influenced by a lot of the Bruce stuff on this new album with the saxophone  and all this stuff.  Look.  Oh, come on.  That song is so similar.  It's not as similar as people say, though, to be honest.  It's similar, but not...  I heard it, and I didn't really recognize it.  I think the original stunk.  And let me hear a Madonna song that sounds like bad romance.  Exactly.  She doesn't rip off Lady Gaga.  Lady Gaga didn't rip off her.  That's the point.  If Lady Gaga had ripped off her, there would be an earlier Madonna song that sounded like 
[02:31:30]  bad romance.  Right.  Or how about Alejandro?  Alejandro.  Alejandro.  Alejandro.  They're fucking great.  Is this it?  And hold on.  What about paparazzi?  Hold on.  I want to hear Born This Way versus Express Yourself.  It's the same fucking song.  Let's hear it.  Good. 
[02:32:00]  Good.  Really good.  Influence.  It's similar, but it's not the same.  It's not the same song.  It's the Vanilla Ice defense.  It's very similar.  And Lady Gaga sounds like Madonna as she's singing Born This Way.  It's so similar.  Sorry, you guys lose.  It's influenced and similar, but it's not a copy.  Lady Gaga is an original.  I would say a complete ripple.  Jim and I are little monsters.  Yes, we are. 
[02:32:30]  Yes, we are.  What is the thing?  What do you do?  The thing?  I do the fucking claw.  Yeah.  We're little monsters.  Not you, Edgar.  I'm a monster.  No, you're not.  Shut up.  Is Chris coming in?  Yeah, he's coming in.  I see some commotion eventually.  He's coming right now.  Right now?  Eric just told me in my ear.  Eric's a fool.  Yeah, I didn't even realize Eric was going to Chicago.  Oh.  You don't need him? 
[02:33:00]  No.  Go to stay home.  Oh, man.  Why don't you go home and shut up?  Yeah, go home.  Why don't you stay home and shut up?  Fuck, you finally told me.  Yeah, E-Rock really knows how to straighten people out.  Oh, my God.  You're going to miss a lot of fun, though, E-Rock.  Why would you do that to yourself?  Yeah, being called fat in another city, that's fun.  You think that would happen?  Yes.  If the trunk fits.  How many cities have you been called fat in so far?  Are you keeping track?  Let's see.  At one point, we were syndicated to 20. 
[02:33:30]  So that's 20 right there.  That's 20 right there.  Now we're syndicated everywhere and in provinces.  You're being called fat in Canada.  It's like an E-Rock.  Eric has to go to Chicago.  He's judging the worst breath contest.  Poor E-Rock.  Yes, you're right.  You know what?  E-Rock is a part of the broadcaster.  Yeah.  So the fact that he's not going to be there.  Hello, Chris.  Hey, guys.  How are you, man?  Chris Rock.  I feel like I'm at the cellar.  I know, right?  How are you doing, man?  What's up, Chris?  Good to see you again.  In happier times, by the way.  In happier times.  Chris Rock. 
[02:34:00]  Damn.  Norton.  Hi, buddy.  How are you?  How are you, Norton?  See you, man.  All right, man.  You're just like the cellar with Jimmy down here, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's Norton.  How often are you down at the cellar?  Uh, a couple of times a month.  Yeah?  I kind of go when my wife didn't cook.  I get some food.  Just get out of here.  Free meal.  Free meal.  Okay, I'll do a set.  How good is the food down there?  It's good.  It's hot.  It's not great, but it's hot.  I like it.  I like it a lot. 
[02:34:30]  Last time I saw you there was when, uh,  I think LeBron James and a bunch of the Heat were in there.  Yeah, yeah.  They came in during, they were there to see Aziz,  and they were running really late,  so they were going to, uh, put Aziz on much later,  and you went on,  and those, that's the only thing that kept those guys quiet,  because they had a party of ten people when they walked in,  and Chris was on, so they were all kind of...  I did my...  Yeah, you did a good amount of time.  Whatever I did.  I did that LeBron, there's an MVP in the house set.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:35:00]  You turned up a little bit when you know, right?  Turned up a little bit when you know.  You have to turn up a little bit?  Yeah, you know, you turned up a little bit.  Do you ever think back to, like, when you were starting out,  when you go into, like, the cellar,  and there's newer comics that want to get on,  and you know they're not because you're there?  Do you think back at, like,  does it make you feel the least bit bad?  No, no, no.  Not at all.  I mean, A, first of all,  I used to get bumped by Rodney and Kennison and Seinfeld.  Like, I got bumped by everybody.  Yeah.  So, I mean, David Brenner, you know. 
[02:35:30]  Right.  So it was your turn to bump people.  That's how it works.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I'm always working on something.  I never really get on stage unless I'm working towards something.  I'm not...  Oh, is that, like, a shitty thing to do if a comic goes in there?  I was like, what is he doing?  I think it's a shitty thing.  You know the comics have been there all night,  and you're going to bump guys just so some girl can see you doing something.  Well, at least that's a good reason.  Yeah, but, you know, I'm coming there.  Everybody knows, like, okay, I'm doing Letterman tomorrow.  Right, yeah.  I'm doing something.  You know what I mean?  So, yeah, I see guys just bump people just for their ego. 
[02:36:00]  Just an ego boost bump.  Oh, that's got to suck.  I got bumped one time.  I was scheduled at the Improv in L.A.  It was probably two, three years ago,  and David Spade was scheduled after me.  And I was next to last, and he was last.  So he walked in with a girl, and they said, look, he's bumping you.  And I'm like, but, well, we're on the schedule together.  And then he goes to me as he walks in.  He goes, hey, man, you know, Robin Williams used to bump me.  He's like, really, did he?  And are you?  Oh, don't disdain me.  I don't dislike him. 
[02:36:30]  But he said to me, like, I've been doing this for two years.  It's like, Jesus, dude, just do what you're doing because you've got a girl.  I don't mind that, but don't talk to me like I'm an open mic.  I'm going up, kid.  If he just said, look, man, I've got a girl here.  I want to get out of here.  I would have been like, have a great set.  But I didn't mind as much because it was a name.  I just didn't like the way he did it.  You should have grabbed his chick while he was up on stage.  I always check.  I always check.  But no one minds if you do it.  I always check, and I always make sure the guy that was going to go on next goes on.  Then I bump the guy behind him. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, then you'll look better.  Yeah, because it does suck if you're next and then, like, you're not next.  Yeah, yeah.  I saw Chris taking a look at the TV.  You watching the Olympics?  Uh, yeah.  Does this excite you at all?  It excite.  Just all right?  I'm old.  I've seen it already.  Some of these sports are kind of dumb, though.  Yeah, some of them aren't really sports.  I noticed no one said anything about Venus and Serena's hair, you know, because they'll kick their ass. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, shit, they will.  Are they even in the Olympics?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They have tennis in the Olympics.  I didn't even know they had tennis.  They got tennis in the Olympics now.  Have they always had it in the Olympics?  That's been a few times now, right?  You know, they slip it in there.  I don't like watching sports on the Olympics that you can watch and do watch during the year.  Like basketball, people watch it during the year, even tennis.  I like shit that you don't ever watch diving throughout the year.  I've got water polo I can't take.  And trampolining is the dumbest friggin' thing.  Yeah, that's pretty high bounce.  Someone is walking around with a gold medal from trampolining, trying to get laid off of it. 
[02:38:00]  That's crazy.  But Chris is in here.  It won't get you laid by who you want to get laid by.  That is true.  Chris is in here promoting Two Days in New York.  I saw it.  No, I'm just hanging out, man.  All right.  Well, it's about time.  Hey.  It was on demand.  Two Days in New York, yes.  It's one of those choices where you can get it before it hits the theaters.  And I've got to tell you, I really like the movie.  Thank you.  And I've got a two-year-old running around the house, and this movie has a lot of dialogue,  some subtitles, and I still was able to focus with a two-year-old running back and forth. 
[02:38:30]  So I think, in a way, that's a compliment.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  What's the premise of it?  Because I didn't even know it was available to be seen.  I thought it was just, I don't know what the premise is.  I thought it was just a porno.  No, that I would have made sure I watched it.  If I could see you in a porno, I would probably actually go to see that.  Me and Fred Willard.  Poor Fred Willard.  I know, I know.  I love them more now, though, than I ever did.  I feel connected to them.  Where do you even find a theater that still shows? 
[02:39:00]  A theater.  It's very rare.  Where are they?  That's an old-school thing.  Why go to it?  Nobody under 30 has been in a porno theater.  Not under 40.  Yeah, I know.  I was just trying to cut 10 years off.  There's no reason.  Porno theater.  Yeah.  That's old school.  He owned it, though.  He owned it.  Didn't he say he wasn't masturbating?  But he's owning it.  He's having a little fun with it.  Oh, is he?  But everyone's canceling him.  It's so stupid.  Yeah.  They canceled.  You lost two shows.  He brought us laughter and joy for years.  And he just decides to fucking go into the movie theater and have a little fun. 
[02:39:30]  And what?  It's a pain in the ass for everybody?  Come on.  Lack his bag and fucking enjoy himself.  That's what he should do.  Can't figure out his computer at home, I guess.  Doesn't have a basement.  Yeah, yeah.  And fucking computer.  Yeah.  There's so much great free porn on the computer now.  Just great free.  And we went through the rough years where, you know, you couldn't see shit.  You saw a thumbnail and had to pay.  Yeah.  Now it's like free porn is everywhere.  All kinds of categories.  It's fantastic.  It's the golden age.  It is.  The golden age of computer porn. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, you think these are the good old days?  No, it's not going to be any better than this.  Because you know they're going to fuck it up somehow.  You know that.  Yeah, it's never going to be better than this.  Yeah, it can't continue how it is.  What's Two Days in New York about?  Two Days in New York is about a couple.  I live with Julie Delpy.  We're a couple.  She's French.  And I'm me.  And her French family comes to spend a week with us.  And hilarity ensues. 
[02:40:30]  Absolutely it does.  Do you go.  There's some characters in this movie.  A little nudity.  A little nudity.  And the father-in-law is pretty amazing.  It's hysterical.  And it's real acting.  And you know.  It really is real acting.  It's, you know.  Are you the only comic in the film?  Yes, I would be the only comic in the film.  Is that, I mean, for comics, acting is not an easy, it's hard, man.  It's, it is hard.  No one's to say it, but it is not an easy.  It is hard. 
[02:41:00]  You don't think it's going to be hard.  Yeah.  But, you do it, and you think it's easy, and then you watch it, and you go, oh, I suck.  And it doesn't, you're not going to be good until you realize how hard it is, and how hard  you got to work at it.  What's a hard thing for you to do?  Like, I have, like, whenever the minor shit I've done, I have trouble just standing in  a room.  Like, if I have to just stand there with nothing to lean on and just talk.  Yes.  Well, it's standing anywhere without a mic.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, you're so used to having this mic and this cord, you know, and, yeah. 
[02:41:30]  Something to fiddle with, yeah.  That is the hard part.  Yeah.  But you were great.  I saw, I saw your play, and you were, you really were great, man.  And I said this when you weren't here.  Yeah, absolutely.  It was with Bobby Cannavale, and the cast was phenomenal.  Bobby's doing a Woody Allen movie right now.  Oh, is he?  With Louis C.K. and Dice.  Dice, yeah.  We had Dice in here recently, talking about it.  And he's doing Boardwalk Empire.  Yeah.  Bobby.  Now, are these big French.  Bananas.  These are big.  Broadway Danny Rose. 
[02:42:00]  Dice.  That's fucking great.  Talking to Woody.  Let me see the Polaroids.  Everything you always wanted to know about sex.  But dig.  We just don't know how those two are going to get along, right?  I know.  Woody's going to put up with his craft.  Hey, Woody.  And we love Dice.  Don't get me wrong.  I just want a picture from the set.  Oh, man.  Right? 
[02:42:30]  Just Woody and Dice having a conversation.  Hey, hey, Jacob.  No, you don't call him Jacob.  It's going to be an amazing project or an unmitigated disaster.  It's going to be fucking amazing or horrific on the first set.  Nowhere in between, right?  No.  Nowhere in between.  Yeah.  But when he seems like he's pretty low maintenance, I've obviously never worked with him, but he  has no, like, what do they call it, director's village?  Yeah, of course, obviously.  But, I mean, even as a fucking...  I don't think I had to add that.  Yeah.  But I might have been...  I was a PA once on the set. 
[02:43:00]  But he doesn't have anything.  He just kind of sits there in a chair.  He doesn't have a trailer.  Yeah, yeah.  I talked to Louie yesterday.  He said it was...  It's...  Yeah.  He calls, action, take, and then they just keep moving.  They do, like, four takes, and they keep moving.  I hear he's old school.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, he gets it done quickly.  He knows what he wants.  Right, right.  And Louie read for him, and he said that when he went in, he said, it's fucking...  It's like your heart's beating.  It's scary.  You're waiting for Woody.  It's Woody Allen.  I met him a few times.  It's unbelievable.  What are you talking about with him?  I'm going to guess you're talking about the Knicks, because that's what he wants to hear  about.  I go straight to the Knicks.  Yeah.  I go straight to the Knicks, and, you know, if he mentions comedy, I'll chime in a little 
[02:43:30]  bit, but, you know...  You know what?  I've got to ask you.  The Jeremy Lent thing.  It hurt me, man.  It does, right?  It hurt me to my...  Because we don't even know if he's as good as he was for those five weeks.  It hurt me to my core.  All right, good.  To my core.  Yeah, man.  There's something about him.  He had that thing, man, that's not even about talent.  You know what I mean?  It's...  You know, some guys are just better from the neck up than other guys.  Right.  You know what I mean?  He had that energy, that just positive reinforcement. 
[02:44:00]  He rallied the whole team.  He rallied the whole team.  He made everyone better.  You know, like, Paul O'Neal is not a better...  Does not have better tools than Bobby Bonilla.  Right.  But from the neck up, he did.  And he had a better career, because he...  You know, some guys just know how to do it every day, man.  Yeah.  It brought me back to the Knicks, and now I'm like,  Yeah, lit a fire under New York's ass.  I mean, I like Felton.  I like Felton, but I really was excited to see what was going to happen with Lynn. 
[02:44:30]  You think the Knicks blew it?  You think the Knicks could have done something there?  I mean...  I know that third year, the contract was a motherfucker, but...  Yeah, but I mean...  Hey, man, Amari's contract is crazy, too.  Right.  I mean, he's, what, the 10th best power forward in the game?  You know, so...  And Lynn brought in so much money last year.  Plus, Lynn...  The stock of the company went up because they have...  The thing about Lynn is, you don't know how good he's going to get.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Where the guys they have right now, you know, Felton and Kidd, they're good, but this is probably 
[02:45:00]  as good as they're going to be.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Probably.  You know, I mean, not disrespectfully.  No, but they're there already.  You know exactly what they're going to get you.  You know what you're getting, where Lynn is like, wow, this guy...  Who knows what's going to happen.  If he'd have had...  Especially with J-Kid backing him up and showing him...  Showing him some shit, right?  Showing him some shit, man.  But, you know...  New York has a way of getting these players after their prime.  They do it in all the sports.  Well, you know what?  Lynn will eventually be a Knick again.  You think?  I guarantee you he will be a Knick again. 
[02:45:30]  Right before he retires.  But he's going to be 32.  But they do make good decisions, too.  Sometimes, like, remember Ricky Lede played for the Yankees?  He was the hot, young prospect.  He had a great couple of years.  And then they fucking traded him.  And I think he was a left fielder.  And you're like, why would...  Like, he almost bobbled the ball during Cohn's no-hitter.  And you're like, why would they get rid of this guy?  You never heard from him again.  No, I remember I was talking to Frank Robinson one time.  And I forget who he was managing.  And I said, oh, you just got that guy from the Yankees.  He says, the Yankees never trade good players. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, it sounds good.  It's like, oh, you got that guy from the Yankees.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he's got hepatitis.  He's fucking terrible.  Fucking narcoleptic.  Yeah, but sometimes they'll make a decision that the fans look at and go, what the fuck?  Maybe there's something in Lynn that they saw.  It's not worth the money.  He had some surgery and all.  And I don't know.  I don't know.  And he's only 23.  I know.  I'm dying.  Oh, wow.  I see that, young.  I mean, I'm always a Knicks fan, but that was the first time I was watching complete games. 
[02:46:30]  Every game, right?  I was watching the whole game.  It wasn't like I was playing with my kids.  I was like, shut up.  The Knicks are on.  It was driving my wife nuts.  I'm like, what?  You say you're a basketball fan, but I didn't realize to this extent.  I'm like, no, it's because of him.  He brought me back.  He brought me.  He really got me excited.  You think the Knicks could win with Carmelo Anthony?  And then we can move on.  I mean, they're going to win.  They're going to win.  They're going to win a championship.  A championship?  Dude.  Okay.  I know he's a great player, because I argue this point with people all the time.  That's why they shouldn't have gotten rid of it. 
[02:47:00]  I'll tell you a story.  I'm talking to Mike.  I'm just Johnny name-dropped today, right?  I do it when I can.  I'm talking to Michael Jordan years ago, right?  Oh, that's a good name.  And it was literally right after the Knicks had acquired Larry Johnson, Allen Houston,  and Chris Childs.  And I'd say to Michael Jordan, hey, we're going to get you this year.  We're going to kill you this year.  And Michael Jordan looks at me and goes, you didn't get anybody we haven't stopped before.  And once you know how to stop a guy, you can stop a guy. 
[02:47:30]  And so LeBron and these guys, they've beaten these guys before.  That's why they should have kept Lynn.  Because new people will beat the Heat.  Not old people.  Not the old people.  That's a great thought.  There's going to be some new kid.  Yeah, because the teams couldn't figure out Jeremy Lynn.  Right.  And Lynn was like, you know, you had one bad game against Miami. 
[02:48:00]  Well, you know, James Harden had five bad games against Miami.  You know what I mean?  Who did you hate more as a Knicks fan?  Or, you know, as a rivalry.  Jordan or Reggie Miller?  Reggie Miller.  Because Reggie Miller was so arrogant.  You know, just like smiley arrogant.  When Michael Jordan was like, I'm killing you.  But Reggie was like, I'm killing you.  It's like, I got a grin.  Yeah, and he's not.  At least Jordan, you can say, is the greatest player of all time.  Jordan's the greatest player of all time. 
[02:48:30]  And Reggie Miller had the model wife on the sidelines.  You know, Jordan had a wife and kids.  You know, okay, he's going through pain.  You know, whatever, you know.  And even when Jordan was playing your team, you just respected him so much because he was so damn good.  You forgot.  You started rooting for him.  Like, oh, wait, yeah, he's playing my team tonight.  Fuck.  Yeah, you always had this fantasy where he scored 50 and your team won.  Yes!  That's always what you hoped for.  That'd be a perfect scenario.  That never happened. 
[02:49:00]  No.  Well, what else about two days in New York?  Because I want to make sure people see this movie.  How much French is in it, and do you speak any French?  I speak no French.  Okay.  I speak no French.  That's what's kind of fun about the movie.  And it's part of my character, so it's not something I had to study.  Speaking of French, all right, perfect.  Someone's telling me these actors and actresses are huge in France.  Is that true?  I don't know anything about this.  Yeah, they're all pretty big in France.  I've been, you know, I was in France.  I was at Cannes and all that stuff with them, and no one knew me, and everybody knew them.  They just knew them.  Yeah.  Wow.  Did they really not know you in France? 
[02:49:30]  I mean, they know me a little bit.  But because you did, I know you did London.  We talked about that one time.  You said you went over there, and you did, who was supposed to do the, I was just talking  to a comic.  He was supposed to do the arena, and then they said Chris snuck in and did the O2 first.  Michael Jackson.  Yeah, there's 50 dates all of a sudden available.  No, it was before.  Well, he had 50.  It was before that.  It was a comedian who was supposed to do it.  Was it Jimmy Carr?  Was it somebody who just told me?  And then they said that you came in with the first comic, I think, to do the O2, which 
[02:50:00]  is a fucking massive.  Is it?  Yeah.  It's like a real arena.  Wow.  It's like playing the garden a few nights.  It's all, you know.  Oh.  You know.  You guys, you guys sell out bits.  You know, that little place, you know.  You can do your tours.  We were on stage at the garden.  Dice was nice enough.  Yes, I opened for Dice when he did the garden.  A few minutes on stage.  Yeah.  As far as selling out is concerned.  You know, I like to say I sell out, but you know, the venues, I just leave the fucking  seat count off.  You know, it's like, I've done Westbury, but of course with the curtain. 
[02:50:30]  You know, it's never the full, you know what I mean?  Sour curtain.  Exactly.  There's a section of 90 people having a ball in front.  So what was that, 16,000 people?  Yeah, something like that.  Was that your first time over there?  Yeah, that was my first trip over there.  And you went right into an arena, or did you know?  I did like 10 shows at this other place.  You know, the crazy thing was I booked the comedy club.  I was like, okay, I'll play a week at the comedy club.  I ended up playing like a couple of months, playing big places.  Wow.  But my ego was like, let's just play 500 seats and see how it goes. 
[02:51:00]  See, it's funny to hear you say that too, because you're one of the biggest names, but  you still, I guess, like any other comic, walk in and go like, fuck, are people  going to show up to this one?  Yeah, please.  Please.  Especially in another country.  Yeah.  A place you haven't been.  So I was all about playing it small.  Did you do the Graham Norton show?  I've been obsessed with this.  I love the Graham Norton show.  It's great, right?  He's the best.  The best talk show host in the world is a gay guy from London.  I agree.  Yeah, yeah.  The Graham Norton.  What makes it so good? 
[02:51:30]  I mean, besides the visual, the colors, the beautiful set, is he's just relaxed and comfortable.  And did he, we watched a clip with Gervais and Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne.  Did he bring you and the other, because he introduced them all together and they all  just kind of sat there together and interacted.  Yeah.  First of all, there's no commercials on the show.  Then they tape an hour and a half to edit to an hour.  So they make sure it works.  Right.  Yeah.  Wow.  So let's cut out a half hour of nonsense.  Oh, I didn't realize that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  So you have plenty of time to work. 
[02:52:00]  Plenty of time to be funny on it.  And it's you and two other guests or one?  It was two other.  Me and that girl from Twilight was the last time.  Kristen Stewart?  Yeah, Kristen Stewart.  How hot is that story?  Man, she didn't want me.  Jesus Christ.  I was like, what?  You mean I had a shot?  Yeah.  Everyone over 40 that's met her is like, fuck.  And they're like, I'm married.  She'll never want me.  Only I knew.  Yeah, she really went for the older director guy.  That story has been turning me on so much, because it's like, as much as I feel bad for 
[02:52:30]  Robert Pattinson and I relate to the humiliation, just to see a guy that good looking fucking  getting it stuck to him, there's something satisfying about that.  Don't you admire Robert Pattinson, too?  Because it's always great to have something on somebody.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's always great to have one on the one you love.  Well, he booted her.  He gave her the boot.  All right.  Good for him.  Yeah.  He's going to bite a new bitch.  That's right.  I think he's going to be fine in the end.  Oh, please.  They're lining up, I'm sure. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, because they were going to last forever.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, she's 22.  Four years is a long time with a fucking 22-year-old girl.  She just wanted to go out and, you know, he's probably boring in bed.  He's a little good looking guy like that can't be a good fuck.  He can't be.  Jimmy's got to think this.  You would know.  Whatever makes you sleep better at night.  All the 22-year-old boys, you fuck.  No, but I was going to say, because he's really good looking, but I'm not really good  looking, and I'm not a good fuck, so there goes that theory.  But I would say he doesn't have to earn it.  A lot of good looking women are not good, because they don't have to earn wanting them.  No, they do not have to earn it, no. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, sure.  I concur.  So they're terrible, because they just expect laying there is going to be enough.  Well, because their nakedness is an event.  Yes.  Right.  There's equity in that.  There's definitely equity in just them being naked.  Maybe there is something wrong with, because they'll just get undressed, and I'm like,  again, I need something dirty with this, but for most people, that's enough.  You've got to lay off the porn.  Oh, man.  Dude, it ruins everything.  It ruins everything.  I'm like, I think I'm, I don't know, 40 days pornless. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, you're trying it.  You're actually trying to.  Yeah.  Do you sleep?  I sleep.  But there's a story there.  Why?  What happened that you said, I've got to stop?  You just got, first of all, it's just, I don't know if I ever told a story on this  show, but I remember years ago, my good friend, another name dropped, Rick Rubin, gives me  a box of porn.  Literally, a box, like he's friends with the vivid people, and like a box of porn.  When you get a box of fresh porn, you're like, this is great.  Yeah.  We can actually relate to that.  You can relate to that. 
[02:54:30]  We've gotten the box of porn.  But it's four days later, and you haven't been on time to any meeting.  Yes.  You haven't written any jokes.  Nothing's gotten done.  And you're like, okay.  You're like, take your box of porn.  How dare you give me this box of porn?  You're like, I give the box of porn to join her, and then he curses me out in about morning.  I can't get anything done.  How dare you give me a box of porn?  Yeah, that is a distraction, man. 
[02:55:00]  It's a hard thing to not go through, because it really does become, do you sleep?  I sleep better when I'm not watching it.  Like when I don't watch, like literally last night, I was on the phone, two o'clock in  the morning, I'm having phone sex, and I'm looking at old text messages, and I was up  until four o'clock in the morning, because I can't sleep once I'm zoned in like that.  Why don't you just nut, and then you can sleep better?  Well, I mean, that would make sense, but I mean, it's like, you know.  But you hold that back, right?  Yeah, but just the visualization, the porn, the computer, it keeps me up.  I can't sleep.  Yeah, yeah, you gotta sometimes, just, you know. 
[02:55:30]  Do you not want, they need a porn patch, actually.  Just a porn patch.  Do you not want real sex when you're watching porn?  Like, I want less real sex when I'm into the porn run.  I think so, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then they start complaining.  I mean, you know, believe me, I've had girlfriends, but what's the matter?  Nothing.  I was just with the perfect woman.  That's just the matter.  Yeah, exactly.  I would do anything I want, and now I have to negotiate with you.  Exactly.  I have to look into your loving eyes.  Yuck. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah, that was always made hard for me in a relationship.  Why wouldn't you just finish and be done with it?  Well, you know, that's like saying, why not have one beer and go home to a guy who's  fucking wrapped around a pole?  It makes sense in hindsight, but, you know, in the moment.  Yes, yes.  More fun to fucking zone out.  So, 40 days, what kind of emotions are coming up?  There has to be something.  I feel good.  I feel good.  I feel like I'm getting shit done.  Really?  Wow.  I finished a book.  What's a book?  What's a book?  Reading or writing?  Tell us about books. 
[02:56:30]  Reading.  Like, I actually read a book.  Damn.  It's harder, right?  It's harder to read when you're fucking zoned out on porn.  Did you start it after?  I started it after, and it's like, oh, okay.  Wow.  I read it, like, in a real amount of time that a person, a grown-up that can read.  That is the statement of somebody who was jerking off to a lot of porn, like, proudly going,  I read a book.  I read a book.  It's a start.  I read a book.  It didn't take me four months to read.  Fuck yeah, man.  Holy shit.  Because it becomes harder to concentrate, like, on just a long-form, relaxing read than it 
[02:57:00]  does on just those quick, you ever go to, like, there's a certain site, I don't want  to say, that you just go to these mega sites, and, like, you can't even focus on one fetish  because it's all there.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And it makes it hard to enjoy any of it.  Yeah.  You're just crazy.  The kid in the candy store.  No, but, I mean, it's good.  It's good to hear.  You're always looking for a better one.  A better clip.  It has to be a better clip.  It's like Coke.  It has to be a better clip.  It's kind of like Coke.  Oh, man.  Have you been tempted to go back?  And what have you done when you're tempted? 
[02:57:30]  You know, I've been okay.  I've been okay.  I mean, I'm sure I'll go back.  I'm no fool.  Sure, sure, sure.  You're just seeing if you can do it, obviously.  Yeah, so.  And how long do you want to give yourself?  It's like a cleanse.  Yeah.  I'll have a Big Mac eventually.  Right now, this is lemon juice and cayenne pepper?  You doing that?  Okay.  This is something I do.  Have you gotten, like, angrier or no?  Like, there's no other emotions?  I mean, at first it was anger.  But now I'm actually kind of calm. 
[02:58:00]  I can kind of sit with people.  Wow, I don't even think about, like, looking at porn as being something that you'd have  to even stop because it's affecting something.  Like, I...  Maybe you're not doing it a lot.  Well, I do it enough, but it's not crazy.  And I know if I just want to fucking toss off, as they say, just finish up and be through  with it.  Just fucking go to sleep.  I got to block some Twitter accounts, then I'll be good.  But do you know how encouraging that is to hear, like, just to be off porn for 40 days? 
[02:58:30]  Man, that's a long fucking time.  Jimmy loves hearing this because you're not alone, Jimmy.  You can do it, too.  You know what?  There's a documentary waiting to happen.  Jim Norton trying to go 40 days without porn.  All right.  Now, I think God only knows what he'll latch onto.  I went 17 days without jerking off about five years ago.  It was actually really good for me, but that's a rough one because the first time I did,  it was just an ugly scene.  Like, you know what I mean?  I was right back to the races.  Tell us Chris has to go in the year because he's 18 years other times.  I don't know if we sold the movie. 
[02:59:00]  I feel bad.  We haven't had Chris in in a while.  It comes out this week, and I have another show on FX called Totally Biased starring Kamal  Bell.  Right, yeah.  This is a show I'm producing.  Is he a stand-up?  Yeah, he's a stand-up.  Oh, he is?  Okay.  So that starts Thursday.  Thursday on FX.  Oh, very cool.  We'll check that out on FX.  Yeah, once a week.  And what does he kind of do?  Just give his opinion just to give a quick run on it.  Yeah, yeah.  It's kind of like Marr or Stewart, you know, coming on it right after Louie.  Okay.  That's a great time.  Yeah.  Great time slot.  Louie's killing it again this year. 
[02:59:30]  Louie's killing it.  FX as a network is very cool.  There's that episode with what's-her-name in the truck.  Loved it.  Oh, my God.  Loved it.  It's unbelievable.  That's one of the funniest.  That might be the funniest episode of television I've ever seen in my life.  He's now beloved, Louie.  He's beloved.  Amazing.  I always knew it.  I always knew it.  Louie never doubted it for one second.  Yeah.  Even when we were making Pootie Tang.  Pootie Tang.  Yep.  I knew Louie was going to do it.  But that's also encouraging.  Last thing is to see, like, Louie got killed for that movie. 
[03:00:00]  And, you know, he told the story of how they took it out of his hand.  But it's nice to see that, like, you know, you're fucking hosting the Oscars, and obviously  everybody knows you're a brilliant comic.  And Louie's being treated as a brilliant comic.  It's just nice to see that, like, even with something that the critics shit on, there's  the fucking light at the end of the time.  I mean, you're a comic.  You know.  And you guys know.  There's only 12 good comics at a time.  You know what I mean?  Like, you know, maybe 15 is pushing it. 
[03:00:30]  I'll go 12.  And then, you know, guys you can count on to be funny.  You know, that's really.  Chris is one of my.  It's a small.  I don't know if I've told you.  Chris is one of my favorites of all time.  Yeah.  You're in my top five, brother.  Thank you.  Big time.  We were playing that clip of.  Richard Pryor.  Dane.  Cook.  Well, you put Pryor first.  I'd put Dane.  I got Carlin in there, obviously.  Pryor.  And I got Bill Hicks, who I love.  Bill Hicks.  Fucking Patrice.  Patrice.  Patrice.  Patrice. 
[03:01:00]  Patrice.  One of the funniest motherfuckers ever.  Ever.  Really.  On stage and off.  You know.  On stage and off.  That motherfucker was a funny guy.  There's a lot of reasons why that hurts.  But the one is knowing he was about ready to fucking finally hit.  Oh, he'd have fucked it up.  Yeah, but that would have been fun, too, though.  But that would have been fun, too.  He would have had his own version of Chappelle.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, Chappelle Tucker.  Cat.  He would have had his.  He has his own version of self-destruction.  Comedy Central executives. 
[03:01:30]  They acted like fainting goats when he was around.  Why?  Yeah.  We'd definitely be asking, why won't Patrice work?  I miss that voice.  Why did he do it?  Two days in New York.  It's out Friday.  And August 17th on limited release.  But probably on demand right now, I would say.  On demand right now, yes.  Right?  So watch it on your own TV.  Chris Rock on Twitter and chrisrock.com is his website.  I mean, it's brilliant.  What do we say?  We all know Chris.  And good luck with the movie.  Yeah, thanks, man.  And good luck with the Cumberbill show. 
[03:02:00]  Cut back on the porn.  It's good.  Yeah.  Get back on the porn.  That's very inspiring.  I'm telling you.  Starting Sunday when I'm back.  You'll be a better person.  Yeah.  You've got to get them out of here.  We've just got TV.  Chris Rock, everyone.  All right, thanks, bro.  Fuck.  The O.P. Anthony show is pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  But if you feel like sticking around after One Day Live is next.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes. 
[03:02:30]  Yes. </pre>
