<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a scathing critique of Impact Wrestling, spurred by Jim Norton's accidental viewing of a Sting vs. a visibly impaired Jeff Hardy match.  The hosts lambasted the show's production quality, wrestlers' apparent substance abuse problems, and the overall poor performance, mentioning Kurt Angle and TNA's frequent issues.  This segued into a discussion of the absence of staff members Eric and Roland.  Roland’s email explained severe gastrointestinal distress, prompting speculation about a Guy Fieri lunch.  A call to the also-absent E-Rock yielded a defensive response, fueling further speculation about their absences, which ranged from food poisoning to a shared office nap after a party.  A humorous voicemail was left for Roland. A lengthy segment dissected an excruciatingly awkward EC3 promo, further highlighting Impact Wrestling's low production value, especially after revealing EC3's opponent to be Taz.  The impending show party, the hosts’ schedules, a traffic stop related to window tint, and the upcoming after-show guests Bill Burr and Jack Osbourne were also mentioned.  Vince McMahon was also referred to as a "dick".


The next segment started with a discussion of bad drivers, transitioning to a caller, "Roro," describing severe diarrhea potentially caused by a ridiculously loaded cheeseburger.  This was briefly interrupted by a news report about planes struggling to land in strong winds before returning to Roro's gastrointestinal woes.  The death of Nelson Mandela was then announced, prompting a discussion of his legacy, imprisonment, and the often-self-serving or dramatic celebrity reactions on Twitter.  Winnie Mandela's controversial past was also mentioned. The hosts played and analyzed "Sun City," highlighting the many famous musicians involved in the anti-apartheid song.  More insincere celebrity tweets followed, before a call from Bill Burr, who recounted his amusing and frustrating travel experiences in Italy, including visits to the Sistine Chapel and the Coliseum.


Bill Burr's call continued into the next segment, detailing his European tour, including humorous anecdotes about the Vatican ("creepy," lacking a "lie, rape, and murder" exhibit), Amsterdam (a positive Van Gogh experience), and the challenges of international stand-up comedy. He discussed Netflix availability differences and the Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit he would be attending. Several funny stories about Patrice O'Neal, including his loud laughter, were shared.  An in-studio bit featured intern Tyler's $600 mission to buy an Xbox One, with the hosts expressing doubt due to post-Christmas scarcity.  Other news items discussed included a woman live-tweeting her husband's fatal car accident, the auction of Bruce Springsteen's "Born to Run" lyrics, the Metro North train derailment, and Reverend Al Sharpton's MSNBC appearance regarding Mandela's death.  Numerous calls offering Anthony an Xbox One proved to be jokes.


The following segment began with a debate about the best double albums, focusing on the Beatles' *White Album* and the Rolling Stones' *Exile on Main Street*, while disparaging several other albums as "shit," "crap," and "garbage".  The conversation veered into Oasis, with a profanity-laced discussion of the Gallagher brothers' relationship, musical abilities, and public personas, filled with insults like "fucking," "dick," and "douche".  A significant portion detailed a former program director (PD) who allegedly lied about the show's performance, resulting in syndication issues and a name change.  Another former employee, "Slick," was mentioned in contrast to the PD's behavior.  A disastrous West Palm Beach radio festival trip and the local PD's dislike of the show were also recounted.  Tyler's failed Xbox One mission was further mocked, emphasizing his distinctive voice.  The segment concluded with discussion of a SiriusXM year-end party, featuring a ping pong match between Scott Greenstein and DJ Sway, and included insults of colleagues.  Guest Dennis Falcone shared a childhood car accident story, leading to further crude banter.  A brief discussion of Christmas censorship in schools preceded the mention of Jack Osbourne's upcoming appearance.


The final segment featured Jack Osbourne, who discussed his *Dancing with the Stars* experience, including the grueling rehearsal schedule (seven days a week for 14 weeks), his lack of dance experience, and his use of the platform to raise awareness for his MS, "You Don't Know Jack About MS".  He detailed his MS diagnosis, its progression, and his contact with Montel Williams for support. Osbourne also addressed family dynamics, including a conflict with a brother-in-law who sold a story about his MS to British tabloids, and criticized the shift towards scripted reality TV.  He spoke about his work in TV production and directing.  After Osbourne's departure, Opie and Anthony took calls, discussing encounters with wrestlers (including the Undertaker and George "The Animal" Steele), double albums, and listener anecdotes about wrestlers. The show concluded with a jewelry commercial and closing announcements.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Gregorio!  I'm Antonio.  This is clever.  Let's get this show on the road.  Ah, good morning everyone.  Welcome to the O.P. Anthony Show.  Hi everybody.  We got a lot to do today.  Oh my God.  Are we jam-packed?  We are jam-packed and we gotta start with the obvious big story today.  Yes, I know.  That is that Jim Norton was watching wrestling last night. 
[00:00:30]  Yes.  Jim Norton was watching wrestling last night.  The big story.  The big huge story of the day.  That's the buzz.  There's a huge buzz about this.  It was an accident.  It was an accident.  I turned it on.  I was watching, just flipped it around the TV and Spike was on.  Right.  And I saw this really muscular guy doing, you know, well, that's the best way to describe it.  He's just muscular.  Yeah.  But he's in the middle of the ring doing much.  What a dish.  Yes.  Quite the beefcake. 
[00:01:00]  What a hunk-a-roo.  Yum, yum.  He was doing some mic technique.  What do you call it when you're working the mic?  He was doing a promo, yeah.  He was doing a promo.  Dude, it was so bad.  I had to watch.  I hate when they say that.  Was it bad?  Oh, my God.  Really?  Do you have the, uh, the...  This is the clip.  This is the exact clip that Jimmy watched?  He texted me last night and said, I'm watching Impact Wrestling.  And I went, oh, no.  Wait, now, Impact Wrestling.  How douchey is that compared to the, uh, the big leagues? 
[00:01:30]  The Vince McMahon League.  Whatever he calls it these days.  What is it, WWA or something?  WWA.  E, F, G.  What is it?  What is he up to?  Whatever was most profitable.  What other organization did he have to kowtow to?  How did he lose?  He changed his letters.  How did he lose to the panda bear?  He lost to the little panda bear.  What the fuck's wrong with Vince McMahon?  The panda kicked my ass.  WWF.  He had to change it because of the panda bear.  He did.  Fuck.  Poor Vince.  So, uh, this is a much lower level of wrestling? 
[00:02:00]  I try to be diplomatic with the wrestling industry, but Impact Wrestling might be the worst wrestling  that's ever been on television ever.  Well, what's above it?  WWE.  There's only two.  Oh, there's only...  We're down to two.  But it's like...  What happened to TNA?  TNA is Impact Wrestling.  Oh.  They changed their...  Oh.  That was so bad.  Who are some of the superstars of wrestling that you can see on Impact?  Mike Shepard?  Mike Shepard, really?  Deanie?  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  Well, uh, Kurt Angle.  Okay.  Ah, I remember him from the WWE.  Is he still denying that he has major personal issues?  Well, he just did a stint in rehab after, I think it was a DUI.  Oh, yes.  He's all better now.  He was on our show claiming that he's completely clean, right?  Yes, that was years ago.  His eyes were spinning in his head at the time.  Like fucking pinwheels, yes.  We don't know for sure, I have to say that, but I'm a bit suspicious at this point, considering  he was a massive star for Vince, and I don't know, seven years later, he's still trying 
[00:03:00]  to get back to where he was.  Jeff Hardy's also there?  Jeff Hardy was amazing.  With the WWG.  What about his, uh, tag team partner, Laurel?  No?  No, that wasn't him.  Larry, uh, Larry, the vendor Blardskin.  Oh, he's there?  Is there a wrestler there?  Yeah.  What was his gimmick?  He's the vendor.  He's like, you want what I'm selling?  That would be great.  Does Impact Wrestling have the Polish hammer? 
[00:03:30]  Oh.  Ivan Putsky?  Yeah.  Uh, no, but they have Sting.  Remember Sting?  Oh, no.  Oh, that old gag.  God, I like some of his songs, but, uh, he doesn't like it when people, uh, stand close  to him.  Yes, of course.  Don't stand so close to me?  That's right.  Yes.  Um.  Wait, why is Sting still doing this?  Well, there's just...  He was hot for, what, a year?  Uh, yeah, he had a good, he had a good year.  A good couple years?  A couple year run, but there's a really, there's a great clip of Jeff Hardy. 
[00:04:00]  Right.  Main eventing a pay-per-view with Sting.  Right.  And he's so fucked up.  Oh, no.  Who is?  Jeff Hardy.  Right.  That he can't wrestle the match, and it's on pay-per-view.  Wow.  And Sting is just like...  What do I do?  Yeah.  So Hardy might have some issues?  Well, things have been sad.  This is like...  The rumors are out there.  What the hell's wrong with these guys?  Wrestling cemetery.  They had great careers.  Jeff Hardy was the man.  You appreciate WWE when you watch the way they do it here. 
[00:04:30]  You're like, wow, man.  And there is a real art to what Vince McMahon and those guys do.  Let me see the Sting-Jeff Hardy clip.  Yeah, because it's like, even though it's only two organizations, this is not close to  competing.  Oh, boy.  It's like Sirius and XM work.  Oh.  They'll merge, and TNA will be the bastard children.  So Sting comes out.  Jeff Hardy comes out.  We just want to see the wrestling part, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:05:00]  Okay, okay, okay.  I'm trying to skip through.  Is it a good match?  Like, they try to stall.  Because this is a pay-per-view main event, meaning people pay money, and this was the big thing  they paid to see.  For this, yeah.  Okay.  Eric Bischoff is in the ring.  Remember Eric Bischoff?  Oh, God.  Remember him?  Who is this?  This was two years ago, maybe?  Oh, this is recent.  Oh, yeah.  By the way, you make it a no-disqualification match, because that way you don't have to 
[00:05:30]  actually do wrestling moves.  Right.  You could just bump into each other and just grab and shit.  Like, really just flub the whole thing.  Where's Eric today?  I just realized Eric's not here.  Oh, no.  He's making a personal day.  What?  Was yesterday too much for him?  A little much.  He's on a little vacation for himself.  Yeah.  What?  What happened?  Getting ready for the big party?  We're all allowed personal days, but strategically.  It seems like it came out of nowhere. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, he's not exactly a chess player, this Eric Nagel.  I'm not very clever.  When did you find out he was taking a personal day?  Yesterday, after the show.  I don't know if it was planned in advance.  It might have been.  It's very suspicious, because Roland's also out.  Ah, Roland's out.  Roland is out.  Roland was not planned in advance.  Did they do some food slobbery somewhere?  Did they practice some gluttony after the show?  Did the foodies go out for some ridiculous meal? 
[00:06:30]  I don't know for sure.  I mean, I went to lunch with Roland yesterday, but I can't speak on after lunch.  And was Roland okay?  Yeah, but then we went to Guy Fieri's place for lunch.  Oh!  Was it exciting?  Oh, yeah.  It was rock.  Yeah.  Guy's coming in next week, I hear.  Woo!  He might be.  What do you mean, he might be?  I heard he was.  I heard he was cooking for us next Thursday.  Yeah, I'm hearing there's a lot of maybes in that sentence.  Cooking with gas.  Oh, boy.  Why maybes? 
[00:07:00]  He might have heard a few clips.  Oh, shit.  I don't know.  Now it's like, he might not cook.  He might not come in.  I don't know.  I don't know.  That's Roland's thing.  What happened?  Well, we enjoyed our lunch, but then Roland texted me and he said, I've been on the shitter  ever since I got home.  Yeah.  I think Guy poisoned my lunch and meant it for you.  Oh, shit.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, because we got a...  I know we're all over the place.  We'll bring it all back together, but I'm looking at an email from Roland, who's also  out. 
[00:07:30]  We're down at E-Rock and Roland today.  Mm-hmm.  It says he sent it to Travis, Don Wicklin, and Sal.  What the hell is that about?  Why would he send it to Sal?  I don't know.  There's no real chain of command here.  No.  So he just picks a couple names?  Yes.  Wouldn't he pick Tim Sabine, at least?  I would have thought so.  And then everyone else, whoever you want to put on there, who cares?  Right.  You don't want to alert the boss.  Subject.  Tomorrow I'm out, and it reads, and I will read this word for word. 
[00:08:00]  Very detailed.  It says, hello.  I've been on the shitter for more than half the night already.  This is a corporate email.  I am down for the count, not feeling well.  I'm walking like John Wayne now after all the TP I used.  On Wayne.  I'm going to see...  TP.  But as of now, I'm staying home tomorrow.  I need home base to relax as I poo.  I think it's the flu.  I'm sweating like manic because of the fever I have. 
[00:08:30]  Signed, Roland.  Did you write signed, Roland?  Or just Roland?  I just...  Oh, okay.  Yeah, Roland.  It's okay to say that.  Yours very truly.  Dearest Roland.  Regards.  Regards.  All the best.  Warmly.  Warmly.  Like my toilet seat.  Yeah, exactly.  Did he meant to say, I'm sweating like a maniac?  I think so.  Okay.  Because he wrote, I'm sweating like manic because of the fever I have.  Yes.  So, no Roland and no E-Rock. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  Damn it.  Right.  Yep.  All right.  Although Travis told me we don't have a...  You know, I remember yesterday in our discussion, Travis, and I was talking about doing Travis's  jobs and said that Travis had sent out an email to everybody saying, here's what I need  to cover from you, you, you, you.  Right.  I was talking to Travis this morning.  He pointed out to me there was no email to cover Eric's responsibilities that went out. 
[00:09:30]  No?  No.  No, huh?  No.  So he just decides to take a, just a day of R&R and a little R&R for himself.  A little R&R.  Get done.  Just to get himself back together.  Yeah.  Under the assumption of, look, if it has to get done, it'll get done.  Eric's AWOL.  Russ.  Well, he deserves his personal things. 
[00:10:00]  A whale without love.  That's what I always say.  Kid works hard.  He needs his days.  Kid works hard.  He deserves his days off.  Yes.  Like everyone else around here.  So enjoy, you rock.  God bless.  Should we call him?  Make sure he's enjoying his day off.  We should make sure he's all right.  Yeah.  And if he's not there, just leave a voicemail.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Leave a voicemail.  All right.  Back to the wrestling thing.  So this is what?  Jeff Hardy and Sting and Jeff Hardy can't wrestle. 
[00:10:30]  And this is supposedly a great clip.  I think for wrestling fans or for everybody?  I mean, it's clear to everybody that the dude is fucked up and can't wrestle a match.  Wow.  And this is a pay-per-view.  People paid to see this match.  Are they stalling already?  Yes.  Okay.  But they're stalling because they know that this isn't going to be long.  And if they don't stall in the pay-per-view, they're at least trying to get to like 10.45  if they're supposed to end at 11.  Okay.  You know?  Wow.  Mr. Hardy's been able to prepare for it. 
[00:11:00]  That's the way it is.  Oh.  Okay, then.  So Sting starts to match by punching Bischoff.  Yeah.  That's not nice.  Is that Hardy to the right?  That's Jeff Hardy, yeah.  In a wetsuit and a face paint.  Wow.  A wetsuit.  Just as Eric Bischoff representing a mortal.  So now Bischoff is out of the ring.  So now the real match starts.  Hardy's holding out to the ropes.  Some of the ref points to things.  No one knows who he's pointing to. 
[00:11:30]  Who's facing the audience, raising something.  He's just not even looking at the guy.  The bell already rang.  Oh, no.  Hello.  Hello.  Well?  Who's this?  Hello.  Hello.  Yeah.  Hi.  Hi, Phil.  Good morning.  What's up, B-Rock?  Oh, hey.  What's up, man? 
[00:12:00]  What's going on?  How are you?  Good.  We were wondering if you have food poisoning like Roland has.  Yeah.  No.  Oh.  Roland is like in bad shape sweating and pooing at home right now.  Wrote a note about it.  Just want to make sure you didn't get the food poisoning.  Yeah.  No, I'm fine.  What do you got on the old burner today?  Well, I have stuff to do around the house. 
[00:12:30]  For the big party tomorrow, right?  Big party tomorrow.  Two days to prepare.  All right.  Why wouldn't you be sleeping in on your day off?  You called me at 625.  Oh, you.  Oh.  I turned my ringers off, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So what kind of activities are on the old plate? 
[00:13:00]  Don't do it.  He's setting up a food joke.  You know that.  No, no, no.  Be smart.  What are the activities for the day?  To a party.  Do what you want.  What do you got to do?  There's no fucking games.  I don't know.  What games do you play at a party? 
[00:13:30]  I said there's no fucking games.  Oh, oh.  I'm not saying there is.  I'm just asking what's going on.  What's the matter?  Yeah, what's with the party?  You're very defensive.  Yeah, we're just a little concerned because we got this long email from Roland where he's  like has the flu.  He's sweating.  He's shitting.  What else is in here?  Sweating like.  That's every day.  He's sweating like manic, he said.  Like manic.  Yeah.  He's walking like John Wayne after using so much TP.  Maybe he meant manics.  Right.  I need home base to relax as I poo.  That's what he wrote as well. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  I think it's the flu.  I'm sweating like manic because of the fever I have.  So we thought you guys were together yesterday so that maybe you weren't feeling okay.  Yeah.  Or maybe you're just grieving Nelson Mandela.  Yeah.  That's a personal day.  You know.  What happened to Nelson Mandela?  What the fuck?  I don't know.  What happened?  That's the flu.  He left a note about pooing and something like that.  All right.  Maybe you wanted to stay home to watch American Degenerate on Netflix.  Oh.  Whoa.  Hey.  Atta boy.  Team player. 
[00:14:30]  Atta boy.  Garnering some sympathy from a third of the show.  Team player.  Ooh.  Turned Jimmy around.  Do tell.  All right.  We're just making sure you're all right.  Yeah.  I'm fine.  All right.  Cool.  And everybody, because Travis has sent out that email about to cover his responsibilities.  So you got everything covered with email?  Sure.  What does that mean?  What happened?  Hmm? 
[00:15:00]  What happened?  I was wanting to know who was in charge of everything.  What?  For today?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wait.  Travis and Kyle got everything.  Hmm.  Yeah.  We're all set.  Right?  We'll be all right.  All right.  Don't you sweat it.  Yeah.  We'll get by today.  Don't you worry.  Yeah.  And we'll see you at that big party tomorrow.  All right?  Yeah.  Yep.  All right.  Bye.  Bye, buddy.  It was E-Rock. 
[00:15:30]  E-Rock.  He's so defensive.  He gets right on the defense.  Here's what happened.  He looked at the phone.  And he went, oh, he's fucking, let's just do it now and not deal with it later.  Hello?  Hello?  Maybe they won't call back.  Maybe they won't call back.  But I think we should call back in half hours.  To make sure he's okay.  Check out every hour.  Yeah.  Check in on him.  Just to make sure.  He hasn't started shitting or something.  Well, that food poisoning, sometimes it takes a while to kick in.  Yeah.  So let's call him in a half hour to make sure he's all right.  Half hour.  All right?  That's a good idea.  Put it on the docket. 
[00:16:00]  Make sure he's okay.  All right.  Let's get back to this dumb fucking wrestling clip.  All right.  I know it's going to go nowhere.  I don't know, dude.  The bow just rang.  All right.  And Hardy's holding on to the rope.  So what?  That makes me think he might have a tough time standing there still.  Yeah.  Maybe his balance isn't what it should be.  Right.  Okay.  Uh-oh.  He takes care of the messenger, doesn't he?  So the one guy's just looking at Jeff Hardy. 
[00:16:30]  He's reacting to the crowd, but he's not really.  He's holding the rope as he walks around.  I'm the captain of this ship.  No matter who's in charge, I'm the world champ.  Who is the champion?  Does he understand he's supposed to wrestle this guy?  The main event.  This is the main.  It's already, the match has started.  Yeah.  He's threatening to throw a t-shirt into the crowd?  Yeah, and he's taking minutes to do it.  Right.  You think Vince was annoyed when this was happening?  This wasn't this.  This isn't Vince.  Oh.  Vince doesn't put up with this shit anymore. 
[00:17:00]  Vince was laughing.  Looks, things like, right on.  I'm like, what are you doing?  But do you see how there was no sort of.  Oh, my God.  Flow to what's going on.  It's just two guys like.  Right.  Mushing together.  He just bumped his belly into Jeff Hardy like that was some big wrestling move.  He ducks under the rope and hides.  Right.  It's just the stupidest thing.  There's no chemistry.  No.  You think the other guy's annoyed?  Sting?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Whenever Jeff Hardy is trying to accomplish, he's getting right in his chest. 
[00:17:30]  Now he just continues to walk around the ring.  Holding the rope.  Enough about the t-shirt.  With the audience.  And he just drops it in the ring.  He's messing with the crowd at Victory Road.  He is hanging on to those ropes.  And now he decides he better focus on the task.  And now they're in some kind of, in that, that dumb wrestling clench.  He's holding on to the rope.  At every opportunity, he's holding on to the rope.  Wow.  They're not doing anything.  Look.  The other guy's just like, fuck this shit. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  And that was the main event?  That was it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.  Shit.  And what that is, like, that's Sting's little finishing move that he does.  Right.  And you can tell, he put his whole weight on Jeff Hardy's shoulders.  Yeah.  And he's like, fuck this.  You're not, like, we're ending this.  It's over.  You're not going to make me look bad.  Like, that was not, that was a match schedule.  He didn't want him to buck out of it.  He wasn't going to let him buck out of it.  No, no way.  Because he knew he wouldn't get anything out of him.  And he knows that. 
[00:18:30]  And that would make him look bad as well.  And if Jeff Hardy even tries to do it when he moves to Sting, he's going to break his  neck or something.  So what happened after that?  He just rolled out and left.  Did people boo?  Oh, dude.  Did we hear the booing?  Is there any booing?  I think I'm just sitting on the.  That was a championship match.  That was a world championship.  You can't fake that.  Sting's look is like, what the hell? 
[00:19:00]  Shocker.  Holy smokes.  And they're trying to make it look like it was great.  Trying to cover it.  I feel like this was the main event, you fucker.  And, like, you can see on their face.  Like, Sting is pissed and Jeff Hardy's pissed.  Like, this is a wrestling.  Jeff Hardy's sitting there.  They have to show the whole match again.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He went all the way over. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, man.  That's funny.  It wasn't supposed to end that way, obviously.  He tried to push out of it.  Yeah.  Right.  He just shot the world again.  That's funny.  Ultra quick victory for the world.  And I bet you Sting wants to get back into the big leagues.  It ain't going to happen because he's an older gentleman now.  Dude, that was bad for their business.  Right.  Who's going to buy a pay-per-view if they're like...  Did he get fired after that?  Jeff Hardy?  Yeah.  No, that's all they got.  No.  He's still the main event guy now.  Yeah, that's all they got.  That's hilarious.  They can't even fire the guy. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, my God.  Well, who's the guy we watched last...  Because this guy is an up-and-comer.  So this all started because...  Jimmy came upon some Impact Wrestling last night.  And this is exactly what you saw.  Yeah.  This guy was working the mic.  And I was like, this guy's got pizzazz.  Okay.  I always try to defend wrestling.  And when Jim texted me and said, I'm watching Impact Wrestling, I thought, oh, no.  Uh-oh.  Because I've seen...  He's going to get the wrong idea.  Dude, I've been watching...  I've seen these guys my whole life.  I mean, I know what wrestling is.  And I know a guy who's good at this.  You can watch a guy who's smooth and comfortable. 
[00:20:30]  Sure.  Rocks that mic like The Rock was always a pro.  I was out by his time.  I didn't watch...  Yeah, I was out by The Rock.  Wow, that was some good times.  It was.  I know.  Oh, my God.  That's when I was back in, actually.  So cool.  Steve Austin was great on the mic.  Fucking...  Never watched him.  Mankind.  Yeah, Foley was great on the mic.  Like, those guys, you had confidence.  Like, whatever shit you threw at them...  Oh, yeah.  They'd be able to keep rolling with it.  Keep it going.  And it was funny.  Yeah.  Do you think he got that?  Would this guy be considered better than Chris Jericho on the mic? 
[00:21:00]  Oh, Chris Jericho is just a pro on the mic.  This is...  He goes by the name EC3.  EC3.  EC3.  Okay.  Let's see the clip that Jimmy was watching and getting uncomfortable with.  I have faced a litany of competition since my arrival.  I have faced superstars.  I have faced international talent.  And I have faced legends. 
[00:21:30]  Come on.  This guy is awful already.  But there is one man.  There is one man who's been in the ring with the likes of Andre the Giant.  There is one man who's been in the ring with the likes of Hulk Hogan.  Look at his dumb...  Oh, my God.  I wish you people could see his face because he looks retarded.  Jim, you're a public speaker, I would say, right?  Yes, I am. 
[00:22:00]  What happens when you take breaks in your speech that are applause breaks and it's just a stagnant noise?  The response he got is only good if he's giving a eulogy.  That's the response you want if you're a waxing poetic about a man's life.  Yeah.  And everyone's pausing to think.  Right.  But that did not get an applause.  They shouldn't have been so pensive, the audience?  No.  I think the audience is booing for real.  Yeah.  Did he want an applause on Andre the Giant?  It sounds like he did.  Or at least a boo on Hulk Hogan or something. 
[00:22:30]  Something.  Like, it's bad when they're not reacting to what you're saying.  They're just booing the whole thing.  There is a man who has been in the ring with the likes of Bret Hart.  Bret Hart.  Nothing.  Tonight, my hand-picked opponent is...  Oh, the eyebrow raise.  Earl Hebner.  Earl Hebner?  What? 
[00:23:00]  The referee.  No one cares.  No.  I don't get it.  Look.  He's sitting on my opponent.  Earl Hebner grabs the mic.  EC3.  Oh, no.  What do you think of Earl Hebner's technique?  I would say that he's not very good on the mic either.  I can tell by the way.  He looks like me and Voss doing a scene.  I'm not a wrestler. 
[00:23:30]  Wrassler.  The shirt represents what I am.  I am a referee.  This is not happening tonight.  There's the mic back.  But he takes it roughly.  He's giving it to him.  Oh, he's wiping the mic.  He's going to touch it as Earl did.  Oh.  You're right, Earl.  Earl, you are a referee.  You are a subordinate.  You represent the 99%.  The working class.  Oh, boy.  You don't like it?  He's trying to what?  The little class warfare thing? 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, he's like a rich kid.  Earl, I'm a one percenter.  I am the nephew of the owner of this company.  Oh.  My money, it works for me.  You work for my money.  Tonight, you are my opponent.  And I know if you're perplexed, who's going to officiate this match?  Who's going to officiate this?  This is terrible.  I have a very special referee.  I just, I don't care.  I just don't care. 
[00:24:30]  Okay.  Open Anthony.  Wait, wait, wait.  So you mean to tell me after all this buildup?  Yes.  You don't want to see who the mystery referee is?  The special referee.  But if you shut this.  But he doesn't have to wrestle.  He's the referee.  You just leave, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sure he's got a contract.  This is Criss Angel shit.  Yeah, he's been a referee forever.  This is Criss Angel hokey shit.  If you turn this off right now before he announces who the referee is, I would never give it a second thought.  Are you kidding me?  I'm dying to know.  This is building up.  I could give nothing.  Do we know the guy? 
[00:25:00]  Oh, boy, do we.  No.  Yes.  They actually surprised me with who they got for this.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Did you kind of turn around?  Yeah, I was expecting, like, nothing.  And I'm like, all right, well, at least they did save something.  Oh, okay.  Is this why E-Rock was out?  Yeah, he probably...  Is E-Rock the special referee?  He's tired from refereeing the match last night.  Hoagie boy comes in with lettuce on his fucking sleeve.  And mayonnaise on his lip.  Okay.  He snapped his fingers. 
[00:25:30]  Who's the referee?  I like the way this is going.  I've got to be honest.  That's Taz.  Well, there's Rockstar Spots.  Is Taz working on impact?  Yeah, he's their commentator.  Oh, Taz.  Can we rescue him?  Let's get a helicopter and pull him out of this.  Oh, no.  Oh, here's the referee.  I am the chief of staff.  You will go in that ring.  Oh, he's British.  Don't you put down on me.  I am the chief of staff.  Get in that ring.  Get in that ring.  Get in that ring now.  Listen to Mr. Carr.  Are you a referee this match?  Oh. 
[00:26:00]  It's Earl Heppner's son.  Brian Heppner?  What?  What?  Nice job.  This is genius.  And you better listen to Miss Dixie.  Who's Brian Heppner?  Is he trying to be a wrestler?  No, he's the nephew of the...  The son.  The son.  Oh, the son of the...  What is he?  Your son.  He's trying to be a wrestler?  No, he's just another referee.  He's just another referee for impact?  He's the one referee's son.  Oh, my God.  They're both referees, but now the bad British guy in the bow tie, who works for the head  of the company, is making him come out and wrestle. 
[00:26:30]  How can you tell he's bad?  Because he's got a British accent.  He's going, you must go and write the referee, the match.  When did you tap out last night, Jimmy?  I watched it for a few minutes.  I just...  I went a little bit beyond this.  I just couldn't believe what I was watching.  How awful it was?  Dude, I was...  It was like, this is terrible.  If Impact Wrestling called you to be EC3's mystery opponent, would you do it?  Sure!  What the heck?  I heard you were talking about me on the radio. 
[00:27:00]  I didn't like...  Yeah, I didn't like your technique.  I'm Jimmy 206 slash 103.  See, because our channels...  Get a little plug in there.  I thought I would.  All right.  I guess we've seen enough.  You don't want to see what happens with the big...  Dude, you're missing something.  All right.  It gets crazy.  How bad is it?  It's horrendous.  You've watched a lot of wrestling.  Sure have.  Where's this rank? 
[00:27:30]  Nowhere.  It's not even in the scale.  In the I don't give a fuck.  That's what it writes.  In the I don't give a fuck.  Exactly.  Where's that on the scale?  He's a bad guy.  This really is an I could give one little piece of shit.  Look, he's in this...  You referee!  You referee!  Why did...  Hold on.  Some gentlemen...  Because Taz used to be a friend of ours.  Yes.  He still is.  You know, we just haven't seen him in a while.  What happened to him?  Why did he leave WWH?  Whatever.  I don't really know why he left. 
[00:28:00]  Maybe some people leave because they think they'll get to be a big fish in a little pond.  Nah, he wouldn't want to leave, Vince.  Maybe.  Nah.  Maybe WWE was done with him as a commentator.  I don't know.  He's a good commentator.  Yeah.  Did all right with radio, too.  He's trying to pump this up.  Yeah.  Well, let's see.  But I don't...  I don't see a lot of people watching this.  How are the numbers for Spike's Impact Wrestling?  They do about a...  They do...  I mean...  They do good numbers for Spike.  They do about a million a week. 
[00:28:30]  I love the darkness in the crowd to...  Oh, yeah.  To cover up the fact that no one's there.  The fact that it's a small venue.  Yes.  You want to hear about this venue?  Oh, no.  It's Universal Studios.  It's the old Nickelodeon studio.  Oh, so like people come in from like...  Yeah.  Oh, so they're not like even wrestling fans.  Half of them aren't wrestling fans.  It's like a little thing.  They're like, okay, we could catch the Wild West show.  And then at 3.40, we can go catch Impact Wrestling.  It's probably free, right?  Yeah.  To get in there?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  They tried to do a thing where they toured and they did all their TV at arenas. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Arenas?  No one cared.  Like, yeah, arenas.  No, we can't.  No one cared.  How big were the venues they were booking?  Well, they tried to book like 5,000 seat venues.  Oh.  And they like not get 1,000.  Oh, boy.  Is that bad?  Really, really bad.  Who are they?  Me on the road?  Oh, Jimmy.  They have national TV and they weren't...  Like they would do pay-per-views with like 1,200 people in a 7,000 seat building. 
[00:29:30]  Do you think it was embarrassing?  Yeah.  They had to go back to Universal Studios.  It was just echoing.  All right.  This guy's getting good, though.  I guess we're done.  This is pretty good.  Are you sure?  You don't want to see that?  I thought this was terrific.  There's a little bit more, though.  He's got...  This guy's on the mic.  You can't turn it off while this guy's on the mic.  All right.  This guy's good.  All right.  Let's listen to a little more of his mic.  This guy's like magic.  This is how it's going to play out.  I'm listening to under protest.  Earl, you will lay down.  I will cover you.  And this colossal disappointment of a son, this man who followed in your mediocre footsteps, 
[00:30:00]  is going to count one, two, three.  This is just going on and on.  No one's wrestling.  He's pinning the referee.  And why does this guy have so much power that he could say all this?  He's the nephew of the owner.  That's right, Jim.  He has power.  He's part of the one.  Oh, the wrestler is the nephew of the owner.  Oh, yeah.  He's a racist.  When I started not listening, I missed that part.  And the British bad guy works for the owner.  So he was saying that you must listen to him. 
[00:30:30]  You're good with the nuances.  You really did watch.  I did watch.  So they have no choice or they would fire the ref, I guess.  Yes.  Oh, I see.  I was very sure.  I was like, ooh, do tell.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Why does a computer work for this shit?  Does he freeze up?  I love this.  Do you?  Taz loves it.  Taz.  Poor Taz.  This kid's a genius.  Is he?  He's going to be the legend.  Earl.  Lay down. 
[00:31:00]  Earl.  You think they're pumping up sometimes the norm.  Oh, he's staring at him.  You don't want to know what's right for him.  Get on his back.  This is butt whoop.  Yeah, that works.  Oh.  What?  Oh.  He's missing.  Earl's laying down.  Look, it's happening.  Oh, no.  He can't do it.  He can't do it.  He can't do it.  Lay down.  Earl, lay down right now.  I swear.  Every fiber of my being, every power I possess, I will put you down.  I will decimate you physically.  I will decimate you professionally.  If you do not go to the ground by your own will, I will put you into the ground forever.  Earl, lay down. 
[00:31:30]  This guy takes dicks in his pooper.  He'll kill him.  He's not used to not getting what he wants.  Oh, look.  He's looking at his son.  He doesn't know what to do.  How humiliating for Earl in front of his old son.  Oh.  Oh, no.  How humiliating.  He's laying down.  Oh, he's laying down.  Not Earl.  Oh, no.  Brian.  Ring the bell.  A ride to keep fucking.  This is terrible.  It goes on and on. 
[00:32:00]  You ring the bell now.  Enough.  Ugh.  Oh, my God.  I know.  It's that awful.  He's going away with this EC3.  You think Taz knows how bad this is?  Yeah, he's sad.  He is, right?  Yeah, of course.  Oh, they do.  He's got the mic.  Oh.  One percent, baby.  Everyone in the crowd's like, when does this end?  We're going to miss the motorcycle show.  The motorcycle stunt show. 
[00:32:30]  He's holding him down with one finger, which he lets.  How many of them got lost on the back lot to her and ended up there?  What happened?  I wanted to see the jaws.  It's got to be so difficult.  Oh, he's counting.  Oh, no.  Oh, it's happening.  Oh, he doesn't want to do it.  He's objecting.  Oh, this is just degrading.  Three on his own father.  There's.  Hey, look who wins the match.  What did the audience do?  What did the audience do wrong? 
[00:33:00]  They literally just stood there and watched him.  We're torturing them.  I mean, our audience.  It's at zero impact.  Yes.  Shoot him.  What?  Oh, he's rolling him out of the ring.  Brian, stop.  Oh, the British bad guy.  Oh, he's kicking imaginary dirt on him.  Oh.  Is that his big move?  Like a cat buries a shit.  That's good. 
[00:33:30]  So he goes and resigns from the company now, right?  I don't think so.  Why?  He needs to dig that bed.  Oh, he's going to talk again.  I've had it.  The sun doesn't look at the sun.  I don't care.  He's shocked and obsessed.  I don't care.  He's obsessed.  He's sabotaging the show today.  It's terrible.  That guy's just standing like a panther in the middle of the ring with nothing to do.  We can tell that sign they just showed was handed to the fan. 
[00:34:00]  As they walk in.  Hey, man, you want to be on TV?  Hold this sign for us.  EC3, we don't need you.  Let's book him for the show.  Oh, God.  You want to hear something that will make you more depressed than the Taz thing?  Hmm.  You know who, like, one of the big stars is?  Hmm.  Bubba.  Oh, Bubba.  Dudley?  Yeah.  He's, like, he's actually really good.  Is he back to being Bubba Dudley, though?  No, he can't be.  He's not allowed.  What's his name?  Buddy.  Bully Ray. 
[00:34:30]  Bully Ray.  Ew.  I've had it.  Bully Ray.  That's all the fucking...  But he's Bubba Dudley.  We all know that.  Yeah, we do.  Oh, Vince.  Vince, you know what?  He's a dick.  Vince McMahon is a dick.  All the wrestling I can use for a year.  That was it.  That's it.  But Vince is a dick.  These poor guys have to move on from the WWE...  You know it. 
[00:35:00]  You got it!  And then they can't even keep their names.  How much money does Vince McMahon need?  A lot.  He had the name before he was in WWE.  Well, he's probably stupid to have signed that contract then.  Yeah.  How's Vince's son doing?  Shane O'Meck?  Yeah, where's the Shane O?  I don't know.  I think he's still trying to launch pay-per-view in China.  Far away from wrestling.  Really?  Yeah.  What kind of pay-per-view?  Just any kind of pay-per-view?  I don't think they have pay-per-view in China.  Man, Shane did not want anything to do with this shit. 
[00:35:30]  He is out.  What's the rumor there?  Does he get along with his father?  Yeah, I think...  I guess so.  Maybe he left so he could get along with him.  I don't know.  He's out of the business.  Completely.  Okay.  Crazy.  As bad as it seems, this is what good wrestling seems to people who don't like it.  That's what Bill wrote from PA.  And TNA gets...  They get a bum rap.  They do have some good talent.  Shut up, Gene.  Who cares?  Who cares?  No, he's right, though.  Well, let's find out.  From Gene. 
[00:36:00]  Gene's got something to say, Ant.  Let's hear it.  Yeah.  We like learning on this radio show.  Sure do.  What do you got there?  Turn us around there, Gene.  Go ahead, Gene.  Good morning, all.  What's up?  Sam, Sam, I just want to say, Sam, shame on you.  You're supposed to be one of the smart marks, and you know TNA has a bevy of talent, like  Samala Joe, like AJ Styles, you know, like guys like Magnus that can really work and  really form credit.  Just shut up. 
[00:36:30]  Who cares?  No one cares about this.  Fuck.  You not interested?  No, a great world leader died.  What?  What?  I was watching Impact.  Oh.  Yeah, but he was a Marxist.  We're talking about wrestling here.  You know, it's like, come on, Sam.  You know, shame on you.  You interview a lot of these TNA guys.  That's true.  You should have a little bit more diplomacy.  You should be a little bit more neutral with those guys.  That's true.  Bully Ray right now is the number one heel on TV. 
[00:37:00]  Bully Ray, number one heel.  If he was number one, he would go back to his regular name.  He is great, by the way.  And there are good people working for TNA.  Right.  But wrestling is about stories.  And TNA's storytelling abilities are terrible.  Oh, my God.  Well, it seems like everybody gets off on you.  This sucks.  Who cares?  All the leaders have marched on and shit on TNA.  You know, TNA sucks.  Oh, sir. 
[00:37:30]  Get a hold of yourself.  I guess we were feeling too good about ourselves on the show and decided to sabotage it today.  Oh, Gene, you're still talking.  Oh, that's right.  I have control here.  Thank you, Gene.  Wrestling is one of the topics that just infuriates people.  I never bring it up.  It's polarizing.  I brought something to the table.  You sure did, Gene.  Jim did a little show prep last night.  Yay, Gene.  Big pile of shit.  I wouldn't even have the audacity to bring up TNA on this show. 
[00:38:00]  All right.  If we bring up WWE, it's got to be something that's like, holy shit.  Right.  That's amazing.  Should we call Iraq back?  Yeah.  I think we should.  He's a wrestling expert.  I said a half hour, but I'm very concerned that the food poisoning is kicking in.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, dude, he might be sick.  I hope the party's still on.  We should check if the party's still on.  Did we ask him if the party was still on?  No.  We didn't.  That's a very good point, Gene.  Good question.  And we have to know.  He's having most of us over tomorrow for a big party.  We do have to know.  Are you going to be bailing in, or are you going to make this one? 
[00:38:30]  No, I'm going to make this one.  You got to.  I took off to go to this fucking thing.  I'm going to make this one.  The shindig.  Definitely.  I've been inviting tons of people.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Definitely.  You got to get the Who kid over there.  He's coming.  Oh, good.  The Who is coming?  Yeah, he told me to text him.  He rocks a dress.  He's going to come.  Yes.  I don't even know where it is.  I don't have his address either.  I need his address.  I just put out a thing on Twitter with his address.  Yeah, tweet his address and his phone number.  It starts at five, though?  Are you guys getting there at five?  What?  No.  Oh, fuck no.  I'll leave around five, maybe.  What time are you getting to the party? 
[00:39:00]  I'll probably get around there, six or seven or something.  Yeah, maybe 6.15 party time.  Yeah, something like that.  Hey, Rock, look at this.  The music will be playing.  Well, I start at five.  That's really strange.  Because he wants everybody out by 11.  He's probably going to watch, like, a cartoon marathon on a Saturday night or something.  He's not answering?  No, his phone's off.  Oh, no.  His phone's off?  Oh, shit.  That's got to mean the party's off.  He's a man of leisure.  Let's get the word out that the party's off.  Make other plans, people.  Make sure everyone knows the party's off.  Okay, we'll do.  E-Rock will be sitting there with a lot of soda and chips. 
[00:39:30]  Dude, I even want, in fact, I either want 6,000 people or no one to show up.  Or just no one.  Would you be happy if it was just you and the Nagels?  Happier than I've ever been about anything.  I would just interview his wife.  How do you deal with this?  They take it pretty serious over there with their get-togethers.  Yeah, I know, I got texted for, E-Rock ratted me out.  Yeah.  And his wife texted me and told me to please stop inviting people to her house.  She's trying to control the amount of people. 
[00:40:00]  And I said, I don't know what to do.  Come on.  More the merrier.  Exactly.  Everybody's invited.  More importantly, I'm very concerned about Roro.  And the shitting?  Yeah.  Oh.  Why didn't he check in?  Huh?  He should check in.  He texted me this morning.  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  Just a little update.  How's he doing?  Uh, let me pull it up.  Okay.  Why?  Why?  I'm going to call him.  Oh, okay.  He needs a home base to relax as he poos.  I'm getting it from my ass. 
[00:40:30]  I hope it goes to voicemail.  Put your finger on that button, please, Ant.  No.  What do you mean?  Hello?  You wouldn't be able to understand it.  No.  Not a good sign.  Not a good sign.  Two ringy dingies.  Turn it off. 
[00:41:00]  Turn it off.  Oh.  Oh.  At the tone, please record your message.  When you have finished recording, you may hang up or press one for more options.  Oh.  Row, Row.  Row, Row, how you feeling?  Row, Row.  Pick up.  It's us.  Row, Row.  We got your email, Row, Row.  He's saying pick up like it's an old school answering machine.  Yeah, yeah.  Pick up, pick up, pick up.  We just want to make sure you're feeling okay. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Are you still sweating like manic?  We need to know, all right?  Like manic, yes.  All right.  Call us back.  Love you, miss you.  Aw, that's sweet.  That was nice, right?  Yeah.  What's going on, man?  Seems like E-Rock and Rowland are in cahoots today.  A little cahootage?  Yeah, they tweeted some weird picture last night of them taking a long winter's nap in  the office with a blanket or something.  And then they're fucking out today.  What was that about?  It's weirdness.  The office is so weird. 
[00:42:00]  Flirtatious.  Those foodies know how to have fun.  You think so?  I am.  Oh, boy.  They enjoy themselves.  I am.  You're still a little pissed about them insulting your steak.  Not even in the least.  Was it spicy?  Too spicy?  That's what they tweeted last night.  It's adorable.  That they're in the office.  I take solace in the fact that I don't eat, like, a pig, so why would I be insulted?  I cooked them a nice, normal steak. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, boy.  They didn't like that.  Just wasn't infused with anything.  That drove them nuts.  A lot of spices.  The title of that photo is Lamoxity.  Lamoxity.  Lamox.  Apparently there were a few who captioned pigs in a blanket.  Oh.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  Good in that.  It's not nice, but that's funny.  All right.  We're going to break now.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I don't know how we're going to go to break without E-Rock today.  I don't know. 
[00:43:00]  I don't know what to do.  I didn't get an email.  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  I'm just going to push them.  Oh, boy.  One of these.  Travis, all hell broke loose yesterday because you weren't here.  You know what?  I had the opportunity to listen.  Oh.  How did we sound?  Well, you guys sounded very funny.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All three of you.  And Sam.  Oh.  Wow.  But I heard someone had a little different...  That brings down our compliment a little bit.  No, Sam was, you know, secondary.  The three of you.  Sam, you were breathtaking.  Oh. 
[00:43:30]  Breathtaking.  Oh, boy.  But, yeah, I heard somebody had a little trouble with my responsibilities.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  A lot of loaded questions being thrown out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And did Fez work yesterday?  He was not on the air yesterday that I know of.  I believe I heard the beginning of the show, and I did hear that, I guess, Ronnie got a  phone call.  Someone got a phone call.  Something about a phone call.  That he just wouldn't have been able to take being in there after, you know, what happened, 
[00:44:00]  and then after our...  What?  As...  What?  We were dragged into this?  Well, yeah, Ronnie said it was after O&A did a sports center on our show.  We pulled a sports center on the Ron and Fez show.  They started the show with Paul Simon, still crazy after all these years, which was brilliant.  Very good.  Yeah. 
[00:44:30]  But, no, no Fez.  He'll be back today, I'm sure.  He'll be all right, right?  I'm sure everything will be fine.  Probably misses the attention.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Oh, boy.  What?  That's why we do this.  That cookie read is fucking priceless, though.  You like it?  Yeah.  Mm.  Yeah.  That made the clip of the day yesterday.  The O&A clip of the day on the SiriusXM blog?  It's huge.  Blog?  Blog.  Blog.  Blog. 
[00:45:00]  It's like log, but blog.  I blog from my closet.  Blog.  Closet.  In my closet.  I blog.  I just go in there with my backpack.  Backpack.  And put on my costume.  I put on a costume.  Sam, where's he from?  Didn't you live in London for like a week?  What's wrong with you?  I lived there for four years as a child.  Ah.  But I do not have a British accent.  No, no.  This accent's made of aluminium.  But it really fucked with your dialect.  It did. 
[00:45:30]  I think I say more words correctly than you guys do.  Really?  I think so.  I don't.  What's your schedule for the day?  No, not at all.  Schedule.  Did you go to university?  You know how they say urinal?  What?  Urinal?  Yeah.  I wouldn't have thought of that if you just said urinal, yeah.  Could you find that somehow?  Urinal.  It was a clip-on, I'm embarrassed to say, but one of the Housewives shows.  Oh, boy.  It was just on, right?  There's an iWatch.  Not even trying anymore.  No, iWatch that one.  It was a guilty pleasure. 
[00:46:00]  For some dumb reason, I'll watch.  The Atlanta one is by far the best one, if anyone cares.  Isn't that the sassy one?  Oh, here it is.  Dear Lord Kyle, I pronounce it urinal.  Thank you.  Oh.  He says urinal.  No, it's urinal or something like that.  It's the weirdest fucking thing I've ever heard.  They were talking like they were building a restaurant, and they were trying to figure out where the urinals would go,  and he kept saying urinals or something like that. 
[00:46:30]  I'm like, what the fuck is a urinal?  Urinal.  Or some kind of plumbing thing.  We just called it the loo.  The loo.  Can you find him saying urinal?  I've got to go to the loo.  I don't know.  I've been driving my lorry all day, and I need to visit the loo.  I'm not near my flat.  Are we supposed to be saying urinals?  No.  The loo.  No.  Rubbish.  The loo.  Those are good words.  Yes.  Make you sound smarter.  If you can find it for after the break, great.  The tube. 
[00:47:00]  Don't worry about it.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Telly.  I still say the telly sometimes.  Telly?  Do you?  That's what they call it.  Television.  Yeah, baby.  Smoke a more cigarette and then a lollipop and still die of cancer.  Who loves you, baby?  Not God.  Exactly.  I'm sorry that Stavros is out today.  All right.  We'll break.  Coach.  Are we guest-free today, hopefully? 
[00:47:30]  Oh, man.  Jesus Christ.  We have a...  We really are old.  Oh, my God.  We have a phoner today.  Bill Burr calling out.  Ah, Billy Burr.  Some very special news.  Very cool.  Billy Burr.  And a special after show.  Yes.  Yes.  Which I will be a part of.  What?  Big guest on the after show today with Jim Norton.  What the hell is this?  Why wasn't I told?  Who?  Cats.  Mr. Jack Osborne will be on the after show.  Wow.  Yay. 
[00:48:00]  He'll get the patented Sam and Jim interview.  Nice.  Wonderful.  Did you ever?  I wish I could listen on the way home.  I got that fucking stupid rental still.  Which, by the way, doesn't have an E-ZPass.  So I have to use the cash lane.  Bill.  Yes.  Bring your E-ZPass with you.  Well, too late.  I can't go to the fucking body shop and pick it up.  Why?  Suffice to say, it was too late.  Why didn't you do that?  Well, no.  It's too far away.  I don't give a shit.  It's early in the morning.  But here's what they did this morning.  There's one cash lane open, which is fine. 
[00:48:30]  Fine and dandy.  One cash lane is perfect.  Oh, now you're supporting the cash lanes.  No, I'm supporting one cash lane.  You need one cash lane open.  But everything else should be unmanned.  I think you've said in the past you don't want any cash lanes.  He did.  Well, I have.  But now you need the cash lane.  You need one cash lane.  I've always said one cash lane.  Because you don't have an E-ZPass right now.  When I say no cash lanes, but one cash lane.  But when you have only one cash lane open, you cannot then station a cop at that cash lane 
[00:49:00]  looking for registrations, inspections, fucking seat belts, license plates.  You can't fucking do that.  But they were stopping cars right there in the one cash lane just to fucking try to get a couple more bucks.  So they got something to do.  Writing tickets.  So they got something to do.  So they have something to do.  So they could just squeeze a few more bucks out of us.  Enough already.  That's why I came trotting in here at about six o'clock.  I left at my normal time that I usually leave.  Right.  But I was stopped at that goddamn toll plaza for a good ten minutes while they inspected 
[00:49:30]  every car that went through the cash lane.  And it was backed up fucking car lengths.  Unbelievable.  Cocksuckers.  As they're looking to fuck over people.  That's why the lane was so slow.  Yes.  And one car was just sitting there for, you know, when you're online, five minutes.  Right.  It's a long fucking time.  And it was five minutes.  And I believe it was because once I pulled up, I said, what was that about? 
[00:50:00]  And she goes, oh, his windows were tinted too dark.  It's like, oh, yeah, that's a good reason to just fuck everyone's morning commute up.  Amazing.  Oh, God.  I can't wait to get my Escalade back.  I got fucked by a red light camera.  I had to pay that deal back.  Oh, shit.  At least there's no points.  Yeah, but it's just so annoying and so unnecessary because there are lights in New York City  could go fucking through.  Oh, boy.  And that's where they put the cameras because they know.  Which light? 
[00:50:30]  That's in my neighborhood.  Yeah?  Right.  And why can you go through that one?  It's safe?  Yeah.  Totally.  Yeah?  Totally.  Because the one way, it's a dead end.  Oh, boy.  So as long as no one's coming from the left.  Ah!  I mean, yeah, technically, I broke the fucking law, but it's just so, like, nitpicky.  Just another way to get more fucking money.  Oh, yeah.  More cash.  It's a till.  I don't mind the cash thing, really.  If I break the old law, even if I don't agree with the laws, what are you going to do? 
[00:51:00]  I'll pay that money.  Just fucking keep your goddamn stupid fucking points to yourself.  Jesus Christ.  I'm good with points lately.  I just watched.  I got full points right now.  Like, it's a video game.  I'm good.  Yeah, you're good?  I'm good.  I think I am, too, man.  I got full points.  Yeah?  That's nice.  Full points.  That means I'm going to get a fucking speeding ticket this weekend, I guarantee it.  Oh, yeah.  That's how that works.  Oh, boy.  How many?  Like, ten.  One more.  Yeah, I've driven with you. 
[00:51:30]  You should have ten points.  I'm not a bad driver.  Oh, shit!  Yeah, I haven't driven with you since we almost crashed on the New Jersey Turnpike.  What type of driver is he?  What's wrong with this driver?  Horrendous.  Sam's a bad driver?  Yeah.  No.  Was he the last-minute break guy because he's not paying attention?  Oh, shit!  I had one short stop on a highway, like, six years ago.  My nose touched the windshield.  Wow.  He's obsessed with it.  As long as your right ear didn't touch the steering wheel.  At least you were sitting up.  I've driven Jim all around San Diego. 
[00:52:00]  Is he a bad driver?  In San Diego, he was fine, but we were in traffic a lot, so it's kind of hard to tell  because we're going slow.  Yeah.  I'll say that in San Diego, he did a very satisfactory job.  And I had Edgar fucking fingering my hand that was on the steering wheel.  Oh, that was terrible.  Edgar was pestering him.  I had a lot of distractions.  He was poking him?  Yeah.  I don't remember.  Why don't you guys say it's Jim pestering him?  Why do you have to call him by the character?  Why can't you say it's Jim just annoying the hell out of me with some voice that he does? 
[00:52:30]  Mr. Naughton does cats.  That's not fair.  You know me.  I don't poke people.  Oh.  I'm a good guy.  But this other guy does.  Edgar does.  What do I do?  Tell him not to...  He's him on me.  I see.  Now, Chip.  Chip is a bad driver.  Yeah, Chip does fucking slam on the brakes a lot and panic and hit the horn for no reason.  At 3.30 in the morning, driving through midtown Manhattan through apartment buildings, just  slamming on the horn.  And calling people cocksuckers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sure.  I didn't feel safe.  I wouldn't. 
[00:53:00]  All right.  Let's break.  All right.  So we got Bill Burr calling in with a nice announcement and some other things.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Oh, I like this song a lot.  Can we just play it out?  Oh, the Hell's Angel thing went down 44 years ago today. 
[00:53:30]  Is this in Goodfellas or...  Yeah.  Yeah, let's see.  Your body's being dumped out, I think.  Am I wrong?  Mm-hmm.  I'm not sure either.  There's so many songs, though, that I hear.  Do you remember when the body tumbles out, when Carbone tumbles out?  Hell, yeah.  Casino or Goodfellas or something.  Yeah.  Or maybe Casino.  Casino.  By the Casino.  Some Stones.  Might have been.  Might be mixing it all up.  I'm not sure either.  In the Departed, also.  I'd be listening to a lot of Rolling Stones today now. 
[00:54:00]  Fuck.  What's the name of the song?  Do we know there's a shelter?  Oh, there's a shelter.  Oh.  Sorry.  I see that Roro is calling into the show.  Roro!  Hello.  Roro, we got your email.  I want to read it again to everybody.  You sent it...  You sent it to Travis, and you cc Don Wicklin and Sal.  Yeah.  I want to start there. 
[00:54:30]  Why those guys?  Don Wicklin and Sal.  What?  Every time.  You know, I thought I did cc Sam and Travis because of the key track, but I was thinking  of shit at the time.  That's all right.  Yeah.  I don't care.  I'm just...  It's just a weird combination of people to send this email to.  No.  It says, hello.  I'll read this.  It says, hello.  I've been on the shitter for more than half the night already. 
[00:55:00]  I am down for the count.  Not feeling well.  I'm walking like John Wayne now after all the TP I used.  He's walking like John Wayne.  I hate that.  Fuck, I forgot where that was.  That's too crap.  Yeah, I'll figure it out.  I'm going to see, but as of now, I'm staying home tomorrow.  I need home base to relax as I poo.  I think it's the flu.  I'm sweating like manic because of the fever I have. 
[00:55:30]  Roland.  Did you mean to write, I'm sweating like a maniac?  Probably, but my shoe was coming out so fast.  My shoe was what?  What happened?  The shit.  Oh.  I know.  So what, you got the food poisoning?  I don't know.  I mean, my ass was like...  I thought it was melting.  Everything was coming out.  Oh, God.  Yeah, that's food poisoning, I think, right?  Yeah, and then last night, I was like right in the bathroom, shit myself, and then I 
[00:56:00]  tell you a shout.  Sorry, we're distracted by a plane having a real rough time trying to land.  They're showing missed approaches and fucking landings where the wind is blowing them sideways,  and they're like, oh.  Oh, that's more than one plane?  Oh, yeah.  Two different aborted landings.  Two different ones.  Oh, wow.  Well, yeah, the one said, fuck that.  This is going to crash if I go any further.  But it looked like he had the wheels down.  Yeah, he was ready to land.  No, I mean, it looked like the wheels touched, and then he said, no way, I've got to push  this back up.  I'm sideways. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  One was a prop, and then one was like a real 737.  It's that windy over there, huh?  That's crazy.  Roland, what happened to you yesterday?  Can you take us through it?  Sam and I left work and said, do you want to have lunch?  I said, sure.  And we had lunch, and on the subway ride home, I started sweating so much, and then I almost  shit myself.  He almost shit himself.  Well, that's food poisoning.  What kind of food did you have? 
[00:57:00]  I had a burger.  No, you don't just have a burger.  What kind of burger did Roro have?  I told him where we went, Roro.  Oh, I had a burger.  It was a cheeseburger with, um...  It wasn't pedestrian, was it?  No, it was a cheeseburger with mac and cheese, like a little bit of it.  On the burger?  Yes.  Get the fuck out of here.  See, that's why I said he doesn't just have a burger.  These foodies always have to add a little something more. 
[00:57:30]  A little something.  Wait, so it's a burger that has a little mac and cheese on it?  That actually sounds pretty good.  Here, cheese, and bacon.  It was delicious.  And bacon.  Oh, my God.  It's delicious?  That might just be a normal shitting after eating something like that with all that grease.  Right?  You got mac and cheese, greasy bacon, and a hamburger.  That is just sitting in there, coagulating.  Wait, and a what?  Buffalo fries. 
[00:58:00]  And buffalo fries.  You can't just have regular fries.  Of course your ass hurts.  For the table.  Let me order some buffalo fries for the table.  Of course your asshole hurts.  Yeah.  Yeah, I didn't expect it.  I mean, I don't think it's a food.  I don't know what it is.  I just can't stop shitting.  I would so repel, by the way.  Now we're looking at...  Oh, they're repelling up the side of the building.  That view is scaring me.  I would repel.  That I could do.  My brother asked me just the other day if I want to go skydiving.  And for the hundredth time in my life, I said, 
[00:58:30]  Oh, Hannah.  Oh, Hannah.  Hannah.  You have fun with that.  Skydiving, no fucking way.  I would repel down the side of a building.  I don't know what you're supposed to do.  How do you stop yourself?  You're just falling.  Once you've got that grip down, you're okay.  You figure out that brake system, you're all right.  What if you don't figure it out?  You'll be all right.  You've got to figure it out.  You'll be all right.  You're pretty good anyway.  Yeah, you'll figure it out.  It's like a speed brake on it. 
[00:59:00]  Because I think you squeeze to release.  So as long as you let go, it's going to break you.  Oh, you're squeezing when you...  Oh, I see.  I believe so.  That's how that would work.  And you've got guys around and helping them, right?  Yeah.  But when you get good at it, then you can kind of bounce off the side of the building.  You get like two bounces.  You're down an entire fucking building a lot of times.  They know how to go down real fast when they're away from the wall.  And then slow down real fast again.  And before you know, you're on the fucking ground.  How do we get some rappelling done?  How do we do that?  Is there a place we could go? 
[00:59:30]  I'm sure we'll get some more.  I want to start slow, obviously.  We can't get the fucking phones fixed.  We're never going to get rappelling done.  All right.  Let's rappel down the side of this building.  That'd be cool.  All right.  Anyway, so you had a hamburger with mac and cheese, bacon, and a side order of buffalo  fries.  Buffalo fries.  And also caramelized onions.  On the burger?  Yeah.  Caramel onions.  Oh, okay.  And what were you drinking?  I officially can't say it's food poisoning.  That could just be your stomach going, what the fuck? 
[01:00:00]  What did you wash down this goodness with?  Whoosh.  I'm club soda.  Club soda.  Is that your drink of choice?  Yeah.  I know.  Why?  To keep the palate nice and clear for you?  Yes, sir.  See?  I think it is a foodie thing.  So we can distinguish between the buffalo fries and the caramelized onions.  Caramelized onions of the cheese, mac and cheese burger.  How was the food?  The what?  How was the food?  It was good. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, they do a good job over there.  Now, we're saying Guy Fieri, he might not come in.  Why is that?  Yeah, is Guy Fieri coming in?  Yeah, just his schedule is flipping.  Or did he hear some audio from the past?  We've always been pleasant.  We liked the Guy Fieri.  Or when he got into a fight with his hairdresser.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  So you got it bad, huh?  Yeah, I ate some bread, so I wouldn't shit in 40 minutes. 
[01:01:00]  So if I would shit in 40 minutes...  Bread does that?  Ro-Ro, you could still participate in the show today.  Do us a favor of, if you're going to go back in the bathroom, you've got to call us.  All right.  All right?  You know what I'm saying?  It sounds like a murder.  I know.  We want to hear that explosion into the bowl.  Oh, God.  All right.  Can you do us that favor?  I just got a new iPhone 5S.  Oh, yeah?  You just got what?  A new iPhone.  It's going to have caca on it. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, you're worried about your new phone getting caca on it?  Yeah.  It's caca-proof.  Yeah, it'll be fine.  Yeah, you'll be all right.  I'll put a baggie around it.  It's not going to get any flex of shit on it.  You'll be all right.  Put that right on the sink, and then we listen in.  Okay.  All right.  Well, I hope you feel better.  Look at the Reverend Aide Sharpton.  Jesus Christ.  Yes.  That surgery's not for everyone.  Did he get the surgery? 
[01:02:00]  Oh, fuck yeah, yeah.  He got his stomach stapled, or one of those type of procedures, and he's lost.  Oh, Nelson Mandela died at the age of 95.  I thought that was Reverend Al's weight.  Oh, damn.  I bet you he's 120 pounds at this point, Reverend Al.  Very thin.  Thin as a pin.  He looks like an old, worn-out shoe.  He does.  Oh, boy.  Are they just parading out black people?  It's amazing.  They are very...  Let's find more black people to talk to about Mandela. 
[01:02:30]  Quick.  It's a big deal, this guy dying.  Of course it is.  He's one of the biggest.  Nelson Mandela.  It's a biggie.  He's one of the biggest in the entire world.  Yeah.  He's on a short list of...  That's called Who Kid.  That's right.  You've got to put Who Kid on that list.  You're absolutely right.  Oh, boy.  But as far as people living, I mean, who else would you put on the short list of that type  of fame?  Muhammad Ali, Nelson Mandela.  Any pope.  I mean, or U.S. president.  Do you mean like non-presidential?  Not anybody of that caliber of fame.  World leader. 
[01:03:00]  U.S. presidents.  You talk about like Fidel Castro.  You've got to throw the Obama on there.  Yeah.  Vladimir Putin, maybe.  Yes, Vladimir.  Russian premier.  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  And entertainment, you've got to put Muhammad, and that's about it, maybe.  Tyson, maybe.  One rung below that.  Yeah, any of those guys are as recognizable.  I mean, any fucking world championship...  Mike Tyson is one of the most recognizable guys in the world.  Let's put Jimmy Carter on that list. 
[01:03:30]  You know what?  It's funny.  He's not, right?  Jimmy Carter could probably do certain things in other countries and not be recognized.  Yeah.  Of course.  Yeah.  All right, Roland.  We hope you feel better.  And like I said, if you have another episode, please call the show.  All right.  All right.  Oh, did you hang out with E-Rock last night?  No.  Uh-oh.  What was that picture of you guys, like, napping in the office?  Your long winter's nap or something?  Oh, Discovery sent a free blanket. 
[01:04:00]  Why would they send a free blanket?  It's very soft.  I know, but why?  That would be an expensive item, man.  Who sent the free blanket?  Discovery.  I heard him.  Oh.  I understood that way.  I hope it was a blanket like the settlers gave the Indians.  Smallpox.  All right, Ro.  Hopefully you feel better for E-Rock's party, all right?  All right.  All right.  I'll just share his place.  All right.  I'm sure he'd love that.  I blew up one of his bathrooms at one of his parties. 
[01:04:30]  Did you?  Oh, boy, did I.  Well, he invited everybody, too.  It was wretched, and it was his housewarming party, so I knew I was having a tough time  that day, so I went way downstairs.  He has a little bathroom in what could easily be his man cave someday, and I'm like, I'm so  safe down here.  There's at least two bathrooms to get to before you go to this one.  Nope.  And, of course, he's giving tours of his house, because it's a housewarming party, and what  was waffling from that bathroom, and I was the guilty party, because I was still in 
[01:05:00]  the area.  I was mortified.  It always happens when you think you're safe.  Someone will, you know.  It was horrendous.  You sneak one out, then people decide they want to fucking get right near you.  It smelled like skunk poo.  Oh, God.  Ro, Ro, we got to go.  Love you, miss you, brother.  All right.  See you tomorrow, if not sooner, if you've got something going on, all right?  All right.  All right.  Bye.  So Nelson Mandela died. 
[01:05:30]  Yes.  95 years old.  What a life this guy had.  Oh, my God.  27 years in the clink, was it?  Yeah.  Do they bring tours to where he stayed now?  I think so.  Because I saw the cell on TV last night, and I'm like, oh, yeah, they probably didn't  put anyone else in there after that.  Yeah, I think.  It would be a real big deal to kind of leave it how it was.  They didn't make money off that.  Bill Clinton and him in the cell looking out the window, and Clinton has his arm around  Mandela.  Right.  And Mandela was trying to move to one side, not to get away from him on purpose, but then 
[01:06:00]  Clinton moved over to make sure the camera still saw him with his arm on his back.  Oh, really?  It was so self-serving.  Clinton knows how to work it, though.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's a master at that shit.  But all they've been showing is the little white-haired Nelson Mandela.  And I've got to be honest with you.  That's how the world knows him.  I've got to be honest with you.  I don't know what this guy's saying.  It's like, let's listen to some inspirational words. 
[01:06:30]  I don't understand what he's saying.  It's a heavy accent.  It is a heavy accent.  It's a South African accent.  He was in from 63 to 90, I think.  Yeah.  That's a long fucking time, man.  It certainly is.  That is a lot of jail time.  63 to 90.  Yeah.  So he went in when Kennedy was shot.  Right.  Comes out when Clinton was 90?  No.  I think so now.  92.  No, 90.  Yeah, 92.  So George H. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, Bush's father there.  That's fucking a long time, man.  I am.  Well, he was in there for Nixon and Reagan and Carter and Ford and LBJ.  Wow.  That's a lot of presidents.  For treason and communism.  He was trying to overthrow the government.  And they didn't take kindly to that.  So they threw him in the clink.  But you know they wish they would have killed him.  Like, after they saw what happened when he got out and the fact that he became president, 
[01:07:30]  they probably wish we should have just killed this guy and taken the heat back then.  Yeah, they kind of blew it.  Yeah.  As far as they're concerned.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got to add that, of course.  Yeah.  And then he doesn't.  And then his wife says, all right, I'm out.  She had some weird shit happen.  Winnie Mandela had a lot of.  Oh, man.  She was a fucking nasty woman.  Yeah.  She's dead now, right?  She would necklace for those fucking opponents.  That's when you take a tire, you fill up the tire with gasoline, put it around someone's  neck and light it on fire. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  And the tire melts into you.  It's a brutal death.  It's a horrible way to die.  And that's what.  Yeah.  They would roll you.  I heard that they would roll you sometimes down a hill.  Like while you're.  Like you see, you can't do anything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She became like super militant while he was in jail.  Oh, yeah.  Like violent.  That's a hell of a way to get rid of tires, though, man.  Why not just stack them up like the rest of us?  The smell is so nice.  You could recycle them or something.  He had some.  A lot of quotes that Mandela.  Oh, yeah.  The one about no one is born hating is one of my favorites. 
[01:08:30]  I don't know the exact quote, but something like that.  No one is born hating.  It's kind of brilliant if you think about it.  He did.  Spike Lee got him for Malcolm X.  It was really a great ending.  Spike Lee really knows how to end a film.  And he was in Malcolm X, but he wanted him to deliver Malcolm X's line about in this  world by any means necessary.  But Mandela wouldn't do the whole speech.  He didn't want to say by any means necessary, I guess, because that implied that he was  willing to be violent.  He wasn't.  Right.  So the way Spike did it was Mandela stood there at the end. 
[01:09:00]  It was really amazing that he got him for this.  And he delivered the entire speech, you know, whatever.  It was very brief.  And then for the last line, he just fucking dubs in Malcolm X really quick.  And it cuts to Malcolm X saying, it was really great.  If you've never seen the end of Malcolm X, it was very well done.  But I kind of thought it was interesting that Mandela...  Can we see that clip?  I don't...  Nelson.  I haven't seen that clip from Malcolm X.  It's the last...  I think the last moment in X.  So Malcolm X slash Mandela. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, so boy, the tribute's just pouring in.  The news nonstop.  And I'm certain every world leader will make the pilgrimage to South Africa for his funeral.  Well, Michael Moore had a wonderful tweet about...  Did he?  ...Nelson Mandela and our president.  How is the United States responsible for the death of...  It was wonderful.  ...Nelson Mandela.  How are white people responsible?  Could someone look that up real fast? 
[01:10:00]  How should we all feel guilty based on...  I should have had some of these tweets printed out.  Michael fucking Fetso Moore.  He had a wonderful tweet about it.  Did he?  Oh, yes, he did.  He is a fucking asshole.  Just a fucking asshole.  I like him.  I like Michael Moore.  He's a phony crock of shite.  But he was in studio and we treated him with nothing but kindness.  Yeah.  He was nice to us, too.  Just go to his Twitter because I'm sure it's, you know...  It's still up.  Yeah. 
[01:10:30]  Like Paris Hilton's tweet?  Yeah.  That wasn't really her tweet, though.  No, of course not.  It was very funny who ever did that.  But it's being carried as her tweet and it was hilariously funny.  Somebody said, Nelson Mandela, I loved your I Have a Dream speech.  It was so inspiring.  And then she goes, I was on a plane and somebody tweeted.  Oh, shut up, you...  You dumb cunt.  Shut up.  There's no sense of humor about herself.  Shut up.  Fucking dumb large feet that I want to suck.  With your dumb fucking deer caught in headlight eyes on your porno. 
[01:11:00]  And great songs.  Horrible.  Wait.  Starting here.  Those are all the Mandelas?  Yes, sir.  All right, why don't you read all of them, then?  All right, it starts with, Thank you, Mandela.  Freedom.  Yep.  That's good.  Skip the retweets.  And then he writes, One was convinced Nelson Mandela would never get out of prison.  When he did and became president, I decided right then, anything was possible.  Who's that?  Michael Moore.  Oh, Michael Moore.  Michael Moore's saying all this.  Oh, okay.  It's possible. 
[01:11:30]  He's quoting, Love your enemy, do good to those who persecute you.  Are you dunking a basketball?  Did that become possible?  No.  Oh, here's the one.  This is the one that really got me.  This was very inspirational.  Go ahead, Sam.  This is from Michael Moore on Twitter.  Yep.  President Obama, please attend Nelson Mandela's funeral on behalf of all of us.  How about, shut the fuck up, fatso.  How dramatic. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  So dramatic.  Please.  Everyone go for their moment.  It's a little bit.  Everyone.  Yes.  Of all of us.  Don't speak for me, you tub of lard.  Christ.  Can you go to the celebrity tweets?  I go right to the celebrities when something huge happens.  You know what that's going to cost?  Because it gets so douchey.  I've got to tell you guys, Earl had a very profound...  Oh, what did he write?  Nelson Mandela's.  What did he write?  He wrote, rest in power, Mr. Mandela. 
[01:12:30]  Damn it, that's fucking powerful.  That's big.  Rest in power.  You have surely earned your rest.  Bravo, Earl.  You earned your rest?  Like being dead is comfortable.  Yeah, exactly.  You got formaldehyde shoved up your asshole.  Yeah.  Your fucking hands are folded.  You can't even scratch your bag.  It's awful being dead.  Jesus.  All right, run down some of the better celebrity tweets about Nelson Mandela, because they all  try to go for their big dramatic moment.  They're a huge, over-the-top moment.  I'll give you the celebrity.  They want to speak for all of us.  Yes.  You tell me to skip it or if you want to hear it. 
[01:13:00]  Yoko Ono.  Of course.  Of course.  Wow.  I wish I could have broken up his band.  She writes, thank you, Nelson Mandela, for your highest standard of commitment to peace  in our world.  We are so lucky to have, we are so lucky to have been on this planet with you.  Okay.  A little much, but it's not bad.  Planet.  Which is the next celebrity?  Missy Elliott?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah, she needs to wear the garbage bags.  I like this bro. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  You mean Missy Misdemeanor?  Yes.  Yeah.  Hashtag R.I.P.  Nelson Mandela.  We can't thank you enough for all the wisdom you have given to the world.  A true leader in love by so many.  Hashtag R.I.P.  Psst.  He's not reading right now.  Yeah.  He doesn't have Twitter at this point.  Let's see.  Jermaine Dupri.  No.  Katherine Heigl.  Katherine Heigl.  Oh, yeah.  She's important.  She is deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Nelson Mandela, an inspiration to all who 
[01:14:00]  value freedom, democracy, and equality.  Oh.  Hmm.  There you go.  Let's see.  We've got Marlon Wayans.  Uh, yeah, let's, uh, let's hear the way it is.  Is this funny?  Did he make a funny tweet?  A little joke?  Yeah.  R.I.P.  Nelson Mandela.  It wasn't like his movies.  Oh.  R.I.P.  Nelson Mandela.  It will take a world of people to grab the baton that you ran with to continue your tradition.  May we all grab hold. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, that's dramatic.  Maybe we all grab hold.  Bravo.  Grab my baton.  My, my dick.  I know, I know you did.  I'm reaching for it.  Charlize Theron.  Oh, who is South African, by the way.  A white South African.  So, you see her on that commercial for that fucking, uh, what is it, perfume or something?  Yeah, yeah.  And she's on the runway, kind of walking with a snobby model face.  God, she looks good.  She's wonderful.  She's working it.  All right, but she's white.  She's broad.  And she's African.  South Africa. 
[01:15:00]  So, she's African.  She was feeling a lot of pressure.  So, I'm sure this is going to be a terrific tweet.  Yeah.  What'd she write?  See, I'd fuck an African chick.  Her.  My thoughts and love go out to the Mandela family.  Rest in peace, Madiba.  Madiba.  That's what close friends call him.  Well.  That's his, uh, his clan name.  A lot of people out there using that to feel like they know just a little more than the  rest of us.  That's like when you get a tweet that says, okay, Greg.  Yeah.  A name that I haven't used since I was 12.  Yeah.  She added that in, because that's, that, Madiba is like, hey, don't forget. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  I'm from there.  Isn't there a new Madiba movie coming out this Christmas?  Is there?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Nice.  I don't think it's the same.  Madiba.  Yeah.  Is it Tyler Perry?  Yeah.  Is it Tyler Perry's Madiba, uh, Madiba Christmas?  Yeah.  Madiba Christmas is coming out?  I swear it is.  Yeah.  Samuel L. Jackson.  Motherfucker!  Yeah.  Does he have a motherfucker in his way?  Uh.  Any MFs? 
[01:16:00]  He wrote, oh, he had to, he had to, he had to name drop a little bit here.  All right.  Never met a better person in my life than Nelson Mandela.  Oh, he met him.  Did he post a picture, too?  Everyone that met, all the celebrities that met them, they just couldn't get their pictures  up, uh, quickly.  Yeah.  I would, that's a good one to have.  I would have watched it.  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck yeah, me too.  Yeah.  Uh, Hoopie Goldberg.  Did they, did they keep him, uh, did they keep Mandela in, uh, in, uh, his friend's garage  up there in Toluca Lake for a little while? 
[01:16:30]  I know.  Weekend at Bernie's?  No.  No.  Pulp.  No?  A little pulp action.  I was thinking maybe they kept, I'm there.  I'm there.  Really?  No?  I'm there.  Dan can't help himself.  Uh, Dan can't help himself.  Okay.  Justin Timberley.  No, Whoopie.  Why would you pass on Whoopie?  She's a big fucking deal, this Whoopie.  Aw, yeah.  Wake up with Whoopie.  Yes.  I want to give the, okay, you were right about this one.  I want to give the world a hug. 
[01:17:00]  Wow, that's tough.  I was told Mandiba had just passed.  Mandiba?  Nelson Mandela, R.I.P.  Time for a well-earned sleep.  Condolences to his family.  Ah.  It's not sleep.  He's not sleeping.  He's not sleeping, and they're not going to read the tweets.  Why did you say Mandiba?  She probably hit the wrong button.  He's going to be, he starts, he starts, that's his name.  He starts being dead for billions and billions of years.  Yes.  It's not a sleep.  It's a long sleep.  Is it Madiba or Mandiba? 
[01:17:30]  It's Madiba.  It's Madiba.  So she wrote Mandiba.  I know, because she thought she knew.  Justin Timberlake.  Now, Justin Timberlake is important.  JT has a lot of followers, so he was feeling the pressure, too.  And let's not forget how much of that black culture Justin Timberlake has taken on.  Embracing it.  Rips off?  Yeah, rips off.  Yeah, I'd say that's accurate.  How's Shade doing over there?  Are they okay today?  Should we all give him a hug?  I don't think the show started just yet.  I'm seeing some black people gathering outside the studio.  Yeah. 
[01:18:00]  To the people who do the show every morning.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Let's do the Timberlake.  Justin Timberlake, one of our greatest...  All caps.  ...leaders.  Damn it, that's a way to do that.  Our.  Thank you for being...  All caps.  Bravo.  ...the true meaning of compassion.  May you be at peace now.  Hashtag RIP Nelson Mandela.  I gotta say, maybe I'm playing the devil's advocate here, but that Sun City was a great  place.  Nice beach.  Right?  Fucking entertainment.  Ain't gonna play Sun City.  Why are we playing that today? 
[01:18:30]  We should play that, because that was the big...  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ain't gonna play Sun City.  That was like the We Are The World for anti-apartheid.  It sure was.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ain't gonna play Sun City.  Bono was in it.  We'll go back to the tweets, but wait.  Wait, I want Sam to play the video, because I want to see...  Yeah, I want to see what celebrities...  I want to see what celebrities were big at the time that aren't anymore.  Yes.  Yes, Sun City was like the big place to play in South Africa. 
[01:19:00]  And then, of course, they put a little embargo on that.  All right, let's look at the artists.  We ain't playing Sun City no more.  What year was that?  Oh, 80s.  Probably like 84, I'm gonna guess.  85.  85.  That was close.  South African blacks have been relocated.  Oh.  It's a lavish resort where you can relax and enjoy some of the world's gay-line entertainers.  Without Negroes, right?  It's part of the reality of apartheid.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  It's a pro apartheid.  Oh, shit. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, fuck.  Oh, man.  Now they're showing some...  Not good.  And now it's the other way around.  Now it's black people killing white people down there.  It's amazing.  They changed that all up.  This was an all right song.  Nah, nah.  Oh, man.  People get hit with crunches.  Hey, it's from D.C.  We got the ones in D.C.  All right. 
[01:20:00]  All right.  Who are those two?  Hold on.  Hold on.  That's...  Wait, wait.  Go back.  Go back.  Is that Grandmaster Flash?  It was, right?  And Africa Bambada or I'm not sure who the other guy was.  Uh-huh.  I know it was Grandmaster Flash.  Grandmaster Flash.  All right.  And the guy on the right here looks pretty...  He looks familiar.  Who's the guy on the left?  Left is a fat guy.  No clue.  Fat black guy.  Ja Rule.  All right.  Keep going.  This is old school, yo.  This is 80s, yo.  Right.  He had a big part in this, right? 
[01:20:30]  I think so.  Damn.  Bono!  Of course you got the Bono.  I'm guessing some pips right there. 
[01:21:00]  Maybe some pips.  Who's that guy?  I don't know who that guy is.  He's old school.  Hey, it's Pat Benatar.  The boss.  It's Bruce.  And who's that guy on the right?  We know that guy on the right.  Is that not a gang?  Ah.  Play some sit-tow.  Who's that on the left with the fucking... 
[01:21:30]  I don't know.  He's dressed like a space-age general.  Pat Benatar again.  Not a lot of stars.  No.  What happened?  Oh, that guy.  Is that, uh...  George Clinton.  George Clinton.  Right.  Oh, Howard Stern.  Oh, Howard Stern.  Howie!  Oh, it's Hall.  Daryl Hall.  What, Oates didn't believe?  I don't know.  Oates was like, fuck it, I'll play.  Uh, what's that? 
[01:22:00]  Uh, oh.  Look at that.  It was a very white person by the pool at a resort.  This is like Boy George or something, but it wasn't.  Uh, no.  I never heard this.  No.  Excuse me.  This was a huge thing.  This was massive.  Hey, it's, uh...  The clerk.  And there's the man himself, Nelson Mandela.  He's a young fella.  Nelson was still in, uh, prison.  That's right.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, it's Bonnie Ray.  Bonnie Ray.  With that stupid hair.  Oh, there's, uh, Oates.  All right, Oates didn't want to be with Daryl.  And Lou Reed in the back.  Oh, shut up, Lou.  Lou's not singing.  I like Lou Morton since he died.  He's starting to dig to Lou Reed.  Finally.  Ah!  Ah!  That was Howard, and now that's boy Gary.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ah!  Ah!  He ain't gonna play some city. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  With Bono.  Bono needs a big solo part.  Whoa.  Didn't Bono have a solo part in this?  It's a long song.  How much longer is this song?  Eight and a half minutes.  Oh, my God.  It's not even half over.  Still got another four to go.  Oh, they're showing, like, barbed wire going by.  It's Friday.  True.  It's a pretty cool video, though, for the fuckin' 80s.  Oh, yeah.  King's Iraq.  Is that Houdini?  Or no?  Oh, not at all.  Good people. 
[01:23:30]  God, I just don't know these guys.  Look how that's ridiculous.  Oh, it's Daryl Hall.  Oh, it's Daryl Hall.  Edwin Jackson Brown.  I mean, Daryl Hannah and Jackson Brown.  They used to get along.  Dillon.  Bob Dillon was there.  Oh, it's star-studded now.  Blue Reed again.  You know that Jackson Brown kind of understood.  That's Jay Giles.  Jackson Brown understood some of their tactics.  Yes.  He used a few of them on Miss Hannah. 
[01:24:00]  Who's that guy?  I don't know.  The guy from Hell's Have Eyes?  Yeah, it looked like that.  Oh, that was...  There's Bono.  That was Midnight Oil guy.  Oh, yes.  Lead singer Midnight Oil.  Bono with the fuckin' evil Bono beard.  And that dumb hairdo.  Yeah.  That fuckin' bouffant hairdo.  It's the 80s Bono.  Wow, who got to sing with Bono?  That guy's a nobody.  Hey, it's Ringo.  Ringo action. 
[01:24:30]  And then they probably redid the drum track.  This was back when Ringo was still accepting fan mail.  Yes.  Sure was.  Yeah, where's McCartney?  McCartney didn't care.  Yeah, he didn't believe in this shit.  He's right in Sun City.  Oh, play anywhere.  Oh, the guy from...  Peter Gabriel.  Peter Gabriel.  And that was Jay Giles.  Did you say Jay Giles?  Yes, the Jay Giles guy.  Some fat dude.  Rerun.  Oh.  I don't know.  This is star-studded.  Yeah. 
[01:25:00]  They're always doing the Jay Giles dance.  Yeah.  I don't think any of these rappers have any money anymore.  No.  Probably not.  Except for Run DMC.  You know what?  They should have played Sun City and banked that money.  No kidding.  Invest properly.  Yeah.  Oh, the Dr. Reverend Martin Luther King.  How much longer?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  This is as long as fucking Mandela was in jail.  No, that was years ago. 
[01:25:30]  All right.  Clarence.  Clarence.  That might be Boy George in the back.  Get it, Matt?  Yeah.  A younger Boy George.  Bruce Dool dancing with the black people.  Bono kissing black people.  This is amazing.  Oh, a hair band guy.  Oh, a hair band guy.  Little Reed again.  I don't know.  Some Egyptian people.  Everybody was wearing hipster hats. 
[01:26:00]  They were just cool.  Yes.  Can we go to the list of people that were in this video?  Beautiful.  Na, na, na, yeah.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Bruce.  It's just a little fucking redundant at this point.  We got it.  We got it.  We're not supposed to go there.  This really put it over the top, though.  Because it wasn't long after this. 
[01:26:30]  But they're like, man, if the celebrities won't play our resorts, we're fucked.  Right.  That's right.  Who wrote this?  It's very catchy.  It was actually Adolf Hitler's.  It was Stevie Van Zandt?  No.  Was it?  Yeah, I did.  I thought he had a lot to do with this.  He was a big deal.  Hey, come.  Wow, that's right.  Uh-oh.  Oh, they love that Lion King-sounding music.  They've been singing that in front of Nelson Mandela's home there in Soweto.  And I call it Lion King music. 
[01:27:00]  Because it all sounds like the Lion King.  Oh, yeah.  I figured that's why he called it that.  I mean, that Lion King-y music.  Let's see who he's in this.  Hakuna Matata means no worries for the rest of you.  What?  I've never seen it.  Okay.  All right, go through this really fast.  You could skip a bunch.  Well, no.  You don't know some of these guys like we do.  Yeah.  Little Steven.  I know who he is.  Oh, yeah.  DJ Herc.  Cool DJ Herc.  That was.  He was one of those rap guys.  You know cool DJ Herc? 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, he was from the Bronx.  He was a really influential guy in rap.  He had a lot to do with getting it off the ground.  Oh, wow.  Stiv Bader's.  Never heard of him.  Yeah, Stiv.  Peter Wolfe, Curtis Blow, Pat Benatar.  Oh, Curtis Blow.  That was the one with the fucking little mustache.  Ah, Curtis Blow.  Oh, yes.  That was what you said might be.  You're kidding me.  Who else?  Duke.  Duke Booty.  The Duke!  Oh, that's who that guy was.  David Ruffin.  All right.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Eddie Kendricks, Joey Ramone, Jimmy Cliff, Daryl Hall, Lou Reed, Jackson Brown, Bob Dillon, 
[01:28:00]  Nona Hendricks, Kashif.  Oh.  Big Youth, Peter Garrett, The Malipoets.  Oh.  I don't know who that is.  Some of these were South African artists.  I'm not certain.  Of course.  Gil Scott Heron, Africa Bambada, you're right, Reuben Blades, Bono, George Clinton, Peter  Gabriel, Linton Quessy, Johnson, Grandmaster Melly Mel.  Melly Mel!  Motherfucker Melly Mel!  Melly Mel was the guy that was dressed up all crazy, yeah.  Yes.  Bonnie Raitt, Run DMC, Bruce Springsteen, John Oates, Michael Monroe, Darlene Love, The Fat 
[01:28:30]  Boys.  Nice.  Ray Barreto.  All right, you don't have to continue, I guess.  Ringo Starr.  Oh, then they had, like, Pete Townsend.  Pete Townsend just played guitar.  Keith Richards, Ron Wood.  Jesus.  Clarence Clemens.  Were they in the video, though?  Miles Davis.  No, I guess they couldn't.  Herbie Hancock.  Wow.  Jam Master Jay.  Daryl Hannah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, she was going out with fucking Jackson Brown at the time, so he kind of fucking threw 
[01:29:00]  her a little bone.  His music always fucking bored me.  It's boring music.  Thank you.  Lawyers in love.  He's a real douche.  Rolling Stone loves them.  Oh, he's a genius.  Oh.  Now the seats are all empty.  Let the roadies take.  All right, in real time, you're breaking down the stage.  Great.  They're all empty because they know what you did to Daryl Hannah.  Oh.  He ran for their lives.  Wasn't he belting her around a little bit?  That's what I'm saying.  I made a million fucking punching jokes in there.  Did he?  Yeah, there were allegations of him punching up. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, you didn't know that?  No.  I made about five fucking Jackson Brown beating up Daryl Hannah jokes in there.  I said he learned well from what was going on in South Africa because he went and kind  of had some of the same stuff going on.  Right.  It was not nice to Daryl Hannah.  No.  Well, that was...  All right, let's go back to the tweets now.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Celebrities tweeting about Nelson Mandel. 
[01:30:00]  All going for the moment.  Trying to get their moment.  Trying to get their tweet quoted in the papers.  We were up to Beyoncé.  Yeah, she's a big deal.  What'd she have to say?  Thank you for all you have sacrificed to improve the lives of other human beings.  Rest in peace.  God bless.  God bless.  We're really looking for the ones that are really over the top.  I understand why people would tweet about them, but it's the ones that are trying way  too hard for the moment.  Goldie Hawn.  Okay.  What?  A light has gone out on this world.  What?  R.I.P. with the other angels, dear Nelson. 
[01:30:30]  Damn it.  That's good.  She's a fucking poet.  Paris Hilton's real tweet was...  From the girl that used to paint fucking shit on herself and dance provocatively.  Paris Hilton's real tweet.  Yes.  Not the fake one that went viral yesterday.  Fake tweet.  It has nothing to do with I have a dream.  Was it, um, Nelson Mandela passed away, but I'm still a self-centered cunt.  That should have been her tweet.  Yes.  It's true.  Just landed and heard the sad news about Nelson Mandela. 
[01:31:00]  He was a true hero, and the world is a better place because of him.  May he rest in peace.  Oh, God.  Someone wrote that for her.  Yeah, actually.  She couldn't come up with that.  You're absolutely right.  She actually wrote, I just landed.  And then he said, well, you should mention Mandela.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, this is what you're talking about.  Tori Amos.  All right.  She went for the moment.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  R.I.P.  Nelson Mandela.  A truly great and courageous man who will always, who will always to be an inspiration  to the world.  Whoops.  Sleep well, Madiba.  Ew.  Madiba.  He sleeps well.  Stop making death look fucking beautiful. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  You're going to rot.  That stinks.  That stinks.  Oh.  Because he was old.  They're like, sleep.  He needed to sleep.  He was 95.  That's a fucking great age.  I retweeted Bethany Frankel.  Yes, Bethany.  And I, well, read her tweet, and then I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll tell you what I.  A truly inspirational person who will never be forgotten.  Hashtag R.I.P.  Nelson Mandela.  So I picked her.  I tweeted her, and then I added, sorry for your loss.  Oh, yes. 
[01:32:00]  Yes, because she's, she's so in with the Mandela family.  Right.  Bethany.  You ever watch that abomination of a show?  I do watch, because we do watch a lot of daytime TV, because that's when we're kind of up  after the radio show.  It's horrendous.  It's really, really bad.  But, I mean, it's not made for us.  No.  You've got to keep that in mind.  That's true.  It's made for, you know, broads, and they are, you know, they're, you know.  It's made for gals.  They have different, they have different brains than us.  They have gals.  They have a different chemistry. 
[01:32:30]  Who else in there?  Busta Rhymes.  Busta Bust was the only one who wrote his all in caps.  Oh, man.  Okay.  R.I.P. to one of our last truly great kings and god of our universe.  What?  He's a king and a god.  Kings and god.  Wow.  All right.  The late, great Nelson Mandela.  I will forever love you, great man and great mind.  All caps. 
[01:33:00]  And also, it's like four, the number four ever.  U is the letter U.  Nice.  I see Randy Jackson.  Which Randy Jackson is that?  The dog.  From the dog pound.  Oh.  So he couldn't get Randy Jackson on Twitter, so he had to add, yo.  Yo.  Yo, Randy Jackson.  Yo, underscore Randy Jackson.  Oh, I like Ricky Martin's.  Oh.  Okay.  Uh-oh.  It's always, Ricky is always ready to celebrate.  Yeah. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  Ricky's tweet was, there is a party in heaven.  Angels are celebrating.  The one and only Nelson Mandela has arrived.  R.I.P.  You think they do that?  Someone's got to tell Ricky he's not going to heaven.  You think they plan it?  Why do you say that?  Well, you know.  Certain choices.  According to the Bible.  Do you think God took the day off?  Ricky's not going to heaven.  Do you think God took the day off to prepare for Nelson's party up in heaven?  Yeah, I think he did.  And I think he also did that while he's worried about subatomic particles and quasars and black holes.  He figured, let me take the day off. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, I'm going to take the day off.  So if he's God, he doesn't have to worry about any of that shit.  Exactly.  And there's no party in heaven.  No?  No.  Well, what kind of music they play, Ricky?  Maybe yours.  Shut up.  To bring Nelson Mandela's body to the Apollo, I saw it on the marquee.  What?  I actually believed you for a second.  Well, look at the marquee.  You tell me what that means.  Well, the marquee just says Nelson Mandela.  Right.  So that means he's going to be appearing at the Apollo Theater.  Yeah.  How are they going to get him to rub the log? 
[01:34:30]  Just rub his dead head.  Yeah, yeah.  And then the sandman comes out, puts a hook on the handle of the coffin, just drags him off stage.  Any other top celebrity tweets?  I don't know.  Kevin Hart, LeVar Burton.  What did Kevin write?  LeVar Burton.  Kevin wrote, the definition of strength is Nelson Mandela.  It was like Hulk Hogan.  R.I.P.  Greatness icon.  Nice.  All right.  We'll get back to that, but we got a big star on the line here.  Ah.  Oh.  Oh, okay. 
[01:35:00]  That's good.  Bill Burr.  Good.  What's up, fellas?  There he is.  Are you really in Amsterdam?  Yes, I am.  And perform?  I came back from the Van Gogh Museum, and I actually, for the first time ever, appreciated  something in a museum.  Wow.  What was it?  I just liked his shit.  Vinnie Van Gogh.  Good stuff right there.  I was last week to get acclimated to the time over here.  I blew all the money that I was going to make over here, and I went to Italy. 
[01:35:30]  Oh.  And I went to the Sistine Chapel that I thought, I swear to God, was the Sixteen Chapel my whole  fucking life.  The Sixteen Chapel.  And I went there.  And I went there.  Dude, I got to tell you, this is going to probably be the most ignorant thing I've ever  said in my life.  Oh, no.  It sucked.  It sucked.  Well, first of all, here's the deal.  If you ever go to the Sistine Chapel, when you go in there, go during the winter, so 
[01:36:00]  there's not a bunch of fat people from Ohio standing in front of you for three fucking  hours.  You go in there, and you have an option.  You either go right, or you go left.  Go right.  If you go right, you go right into it, and you look up, and you see it.  If you go left, like I did, like an asshole, it takes you through the whole Vatican fucking  museum.  Oh, shit.  Every goddamn pot and pan they ever fucking used for, like, the last 600 fucking years. 
[01:36:30]  And every other room you walk into, the ceiling is painted.  So you're looking up, and you're like, is this it?  Is this the Sixteen Chapel?  Keep going.  Dude, by the time I got to it, I so didn't even give a fuck.  And then you get there, and it's so small.  That picture where God's reaching out with his creepy index finger to touch the other guy's  finger in an uncomfortable way.  Dude, you could cut that out and hang it over your fireplace, and it would look normal. 
[01:37:00]  Wow.  It's not big?  Yeah, so everybody walks in there, and they kind of, you know, I can't say, well, people  were talking, looking at it, and that's the greatest part.  But you start talking, looking at it, and then the guards in the Vatican start shushing  you.  They're going, shh.  Come on.  Which, of course, you know, taps into every aspect of being a comedian where you want to  be like, I'll go fuck yourself.  In the Vatican.  Of course, because there's nothing special going on in there. 
[01:37:30]  You're looking at, I guess, a special place.  But why are they shushing people?  Everyone's there just to observe and check it out.  Yeah.  There's no sermons going on or anything.  Maybe read up on it.  I guess it discusses the beginning of life and everything.  But it's their version, which I don't buy into.  Right.  But the Coliseum was great.  But anyway.  Oh, the Coliseum was great.  You can't just blow that off.  Yeah, that's like.  What do you like about the Coliseum?  That's huge.  The Coliseum, you can see that all modern day stadiums are basically based off of that. 
[01:38:00]  I'm not saying the Coliseum didn't steal something from the Greeks or some shit.  I don't know what.  The oldest one standing.  Dude, you walk in, you feel like you're going to like the Meadowlands.  But like, and like the fucking, I don't know, whenever the hell they built it.  I apologize when I go to something, I don't get the headphones and listen to the recording.  I just want to walk through it at my own pace. 
[01:38:30]  And I think that that's why I just enjoyed the Van Gogh thing, because I went in there by myself.  I was in and out in 35 minutes.  I have a whole new appreciation for the guy.  And you didn't have to get bored.  I became a headphone guy when I go to these places.  Oh, you do?  A little bit.  Yeah.  Alcatraz turned me around.  And I wore the headphones there.  I loved it.  You know what?  I got it.  Yeah, but that's Alcatraz.  That's like a prison.  You're not looking at like, this is his spoon Al Capone used when he had cereal. 
[01:39:00]  Well, yeah.  It was a little monotonous.  You're right.  I felt like I learned something that day.  That's pretty good.  How many people would fit in the Coliseum?  It was 50,000 to 80,000.  Jesus Christ.  It was a real size thing.  And they had all these different levels to it.  It was the same shit.  You had to peak the corporate seats down low.  You had a mezzanine level.  And then you had the farmers sit way up top.  That's fucked up. 
[01:39:30]  It was just like concession stands.  Wow.  That is so fucked up that it's like the same thing.  It was ancient.  Those Romans.  Yeah, totally.  And the guys down below, you know, we're getting more ass than the people up top unless they had the gift of gab.  Yeah, yeah.  Are you allowed to walk through the seats and stuff?  Or where do they limit you?  Well, the seats, I think, were initially made out of wood or something because they don't exist anymore.  And, you know, it's basically you're walking through a ruin, but it's remarkably still intact. 
[01:40:00]  I'm not telling you, like, I've seen, I went to the Grand Canyon and didn't give a shit.  But just to put it into perspective, like, you get off the subway station and you walk out and it's like, there it is.  It doesn't even look real.  Wow.  I've seen so many pictures of it.  You're like, oh, my God, that's the fucking Coliseum.  Wow.  And then that's basically the most intelligent thing that I can say about it.  I'm like, yeah, that's the fucking Coliseum. 
[01:40:30]  I'd like to show that I'm somehow smarter for having seen it.  I'm not.  But it's definitely, and the food, the food is insane.  And Italians are some of the best drivers I've ever seen in my life.  They're fucking, they're aggressive the way Bostonians and New Yorkers are.  But it's to a whole other level where they're on, like, scooters.  Yeah.  On the other side of the double line going around cars in, like, a group of six in single file. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  And you'll be in the cab on the other side going, oh, my God, we're going to hit that guy.  We're going to hit that guy.  And the cab driver never slows down and neither does the guy in the scooter.  Wow.  It's like that game Centipede.  And they just fucking all just move slightly over.  He drifts over and they just keep going.  They're fucking maniacs.  They're maniacs.  And they had, like, three guys on a moped.  Did you see that, where they just pile them on?  No, that's more like Thailand. 
[01:41:30]  Vietnam.  Well, honestly, I saw that when I went to Athens.  They piled them on their scooters, but whatever.  How did you figure out the subway in Italy?  Oh, dude, that was frustrating as hell because, you know, you had to make a change.  And when you're in Rome, it's like being in New York.  So they just have that sense of just because I'm here, therefore I'm successful sort of attitude.  So if you ask them, they'll say it one time and then you go, wait a minute, blah, blah. 
[01:42:00]  And they'll just kind of, like, drift away.  But I've done that.  Right.  So I didn't get mad at that.  But if you go to the information booth, the people in the information booth, unlike New York, they're fucking sweethearts.  Oh, yeah.  They smile on the face, speak perfect English, and they let you know.  Wow.  We were staying over near the Vatican, which is really creepy.  It's like it's its own country.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a sovereign state within it.  It's got this giant fucking wall.  And I don't know.  I was making a lot of jokes when I was in there that was making me a – she was laughing and also telling me to shut up. 
[01:42:30]  Because we were going through the Vatican fucking museum.  I was, like, 800 yards in front of her.  Just trying to get through it, right?  Who cares?  And when we got out of it, she goes, so what did you think?  I go, it's great.  I go, they had everything in there but the lie, rape, and murder.  They didn't have the room where some little boy was getting bent up.  Oh, my God. 
[01:43:00]  I immediately left that out.  Oh, Bill, you're a rock star.  You took that with them.  They have – I don't know, but it was really cool.  Like, you could go over and – like, the Pope gives mass, and he could just show up.  Wow, that's –  I really respected that just as far as trying to sell tickets.  Like, you come out there, the guy, he's killing it.  Like, he's just fucking, like – like, Kevin Hart, Dane Cook, and all those guys combined.  He's got tickets.  Like, fucking – 
[01:43:30]  The Pope's going over big.  Yeah, the Pope goes over big over there.  Right.  Wow.  We could have walked over to it, and me and Nia wake up, and she's just – I was like,  do you really want to go to this?  And we were both jet-lagged, and I'm like, I don't even believe in this shit.  Like –  But then, you know, and I actually said to her, I go, this is like the greatest – this  would be a great Opie and Anthony stunt, not to get you guys in trouble.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, shit.  There's really nothing stopping you from going there and just heckling.  Heckle the Pope. 
[01:44:00]  Other than – the only thing that made me nervous was I was no longer in Italy.  So if I get grabbed by a Vatican guard, like, where are they going to take me?  Oh, that's – literally a dungeon.  Yeah, they have a dungeon.  Yeah, are they going to take me back into Italy, or am I going to go into the – you've  been a naughty boy room?  Yeah.  Oh, it's like a sovereign nation, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, they have their own rules, man.  San Marino, Liechtenstein, and, like, fucking Singapore.  There's a few of those.  And, of course, me, I go on the Internet, and I try to look up conspiracy, like, that's 
[01:44:30]  where the Illuminati lives.  Yeah.  Like, Liechtenstein literally is like a country of – I think that's how you say it – like,  like, 3,500 people.  Mm-hmm.  And they – so with all rules of history, they should have been overrun by a pack of  fucking Huns a long time ago.  Like, how do these guys – how do they defend their country?  Yeah.  Unless they do something with the banks or something that keeps everybody out, like,  there might be a reason that nobody fucks with them.  Maybe they serve some kind of a need. 
[01:45:00]  They have the Ark of the Covenant or something.  Oh, do they?  Yeah, I would say that they're pretty much running shit.  Yeah, thank you.  They're doing something.  They got God on their side.  Yeah.  The fear of God.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah, if you're going back to the Vatican, yeah.  Yeah.  I don't have no idea.  But whatever.  It's been a good tour so far.  Wait, wait.  I wanted to hear about the Van Gogh Museum.  So that was cool, huh?  Yeah, you know what I loved?  I immediately loved the guy because one of the first paintings I looked at, he was in  this class, and he had to draw, like, a skull, like, the skeleton. 
[01:45:30]  So he drew it in an amazing way, and then in the end, he put a cigarette in its mouth  as, like, a fuck you to the teacher.  So immediately, I liked the guy.  I'm like, all right, I like this guy.  I never saw that one.  And you're in Amsterdam performing?  I did a show here last night.  It was great.  I was going to ask you, so they completely understand your comedy and all that?  Yeah, Europe is like a mindfuck when you get over here because if you think too much 
[01:46:00]  I'm in Amsterdam, it's going to put you on your heels.  I just act like I'm in the States.  And, you know, once every ten minutes I'll say something that falls flat and they don't  get it, and then I just make fun of the fact that I didn't do any research about what they  knew or what they did.  And then they laugh, and then you keep going.  But, like, Ari Shaffir's out here next week.  You know, obviously, the further in Eastern Europe you go, it starts to get a little more 
[01:46:30]  difficult.  Like, I got one in Finland coming up, and I remember last time it was, it wasn't like  they didn't get it, but, like, it was more like, it was very, like, sometimes if you  do a college gig, you think you're bombing, but you find out later you're just at a really  smart school, and they're more, like, cerebral.  Right.  They don't laugh the way morons like myself would laugh, so you kind of get, like, a sense  that you're bombing, but you're not.  But the one I'm kind of nervous about is I'm ending up in Iceland, and I did an interview 
[01:47:00]  with them, and their language, when they did the intro, they literally sounded like, like  the new Sabbath album when they run, like, Ozzy's fucking whatever he's saying backwards.  Oh, wow.  They're like, thank you for calling.  Let me do the intro, and then we do an interview.  And I'm like, okay.  And then I just hear,  But how does it feel to have fans in Amsterdam? 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, that's got to be cool.  Yeah, well, I mean, it's, yes, it's, uh.  It's got to be, I mean, that's got to just blow your mind.  Yeah, no, it does.  It does.  Every time you come, but you guys, the thing about it is, you don't understand it, you guys  have fans over here, too.  It's the amazing thing about the internet.  Right.  It's crazy, yeah.  But we feel like we have, but we, we feel like we have, like, small pockets of fans  in all these countries, you know, not, nothing, nothing to really, you know, to brag about. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, you have to build it.  Believe me, dude, last time I came over here, I did, like, Copenhagen, and I was in front  of, like, 17 people.  Like, I flew 15 hours.  I had to play with 17 people.  Doing the Boston Comedy Club on a Tuesday night, and that was definitely depressing.  But it's got to be cool that.  It's just like the States, where you just have to keep going, you keep building it up,  you know, a new hour, but they're definitely, you know, I did a tour of some of the flyover 
[01:48:30]  states, so-called flyover states, and there's an element of, there's definitely, this is  outside my market, no one's going to know who I am, but then there's the other side,  is the people who show up are fucking rabid fans and psyched that you came out, and they'll  drag, like, two or three people with them.  Uh-huh.  This is the guy I'm telling you about, you guys.  Oh, yeah, cool.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, but.  Hey, Bill, do they run your specials over there?  Have you been running those foreign countries?  Um, I mean, only the ones that Netflix is in, but, uh. 
[01:49:00]  Does Netflix cross over, or is it just there's a U.S. Netflix and, like, a Canadian and an  Australian?  How does that work?  Like, because I've had people tell me on certain ones, like, no, you're not on Netflix  in this country.  Yeah, I think there is an element of that.  Okay.  I'm not, I'm not really sure how it works.  I just approached Europe the same way I did the United States, where it's just like, I'm  just going to keep coming back.  Right.  Until I somehow get this thing going over here, and, um, but, I mean, Jim, I've, I've been 
[01:49:30]  telling you for years, dude, you, like, you should just start with England, and you would  do great, like, like, look, like, Scotland and Ireland, in England, right there.  Like, London, that's like, they're like Manhattan, all right?  If you go up to Manchester, from what I hear, they're more like, that's like doing Boston,  or, or, you know, whatever, like, more like a blue-collar kind of city.  Right.  And, you know, you've, you've performed to the people over here that way.  There's no, I would start with those three, because there's no, there's no language barrier. 
[01:50:00]  Right.  And, um, you know, you go to Scotland, they're a little more drunk and rowdy, but you've,  you've, you've performed in front of those kinds of people.  And like I said, it's just sort of a, it's, it's more on your end, mentally, to just not  be thinking, all right, I'm in Scotland, and just start thinking about train spotting,  and that guy throwing the beer, like, that's what I was thinking when I said that to them  when I was on stage, like, that was my view of them, and they laughed. 
[01:50:30]  And I was like, that doesn't happen over here, right?  And they're like, no, no, it does, it does.  You know, you know what my, my hesitation is, like, because I am actually tempted to do  it, but they want you for, like, they wanted to put the special on somewhere, but they said  they want you to come over and tour for, like, two weeks or whatever, they want too much  time, and I can't get away from that kind of time.  Now, that, that, that was back in the day before the power of the internet.  Now, you dictate.  What I would do, if I was you, Jim, you're a huge fan of the UFC, next time, you know,  Rogan and those guys are announcing over in London, just do, go to the fight, and then 
[01:51:00]  do, like, the Leicester Square Theater.  It's like a 200, 300 seater.  First time I went there, I mean, I maybe got it, like, three quarters full.  I had him, 2,500, 30 feet, but I had a great time.  And, and, and those people are left, they talk, and, you know, I include those countries  when I do my podcasts.  I, just by making fun of them, they start listening, and then they correct me on the 
[01:51:30]  shit that I'm wrong about, and then they go, hey, you should come over here.  There's, there's this gig over here, yada, yada, yada.  And, um, it's, it's weird, it's, it's the same as trying, like, for us, um, East Coast  guys to try to break, like, going down South.  How do I still break this down the South?  I'm not one of those blue-collar guys.  I sound like I'm from fucking, you know, Boston.  How do I do this?  And it's, it's, you just gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta go where they're at.  Um, or come up with some Whoop-Em-Gangham-style song. 
[01:52:00]  Right.  That's another way to sell it.  Well, you know, I've found that the, uh, the, the emails I get are from a lot of those  countries, like, hey, come over, come over, and I guess I should, I should try it once.  Just try it, what the hell.  You should give it a whirl, Jim.  How's the, you'll be, I, honestly, you'll be surprised there'll be people who, like, fly  in, like, I had, uh, I had a couple people flew for the, uh, the Scotland gig.  They flew in from Poland to see it, which sounds insane, but that's, like, flying into 
[01:52:30]  New York from, like, Ohio.  Right.  Like, the thing is, they're so close together.  Like, last night, some people from Belgium and Germany came over, and I'm like, Jesus  Christ, how long a drive is that to Amsterdam?  They're like, three and a half hours.  And I was just like, that's fucking nuts to me.  Three and a half hours, I'm in D.C.  Right.  If I'm in New York.  Yeah, yeah.  And they're in an entirely different country, so, um.  That's pretty cool.  How's the money over there?  The language is kind of like the euro.  And how is, how is the cash? 
[01:53:00]  The, uh, it's just like the United States.  Oh, okay.  You don't sell shit, you don't make shit.  I gotcha.  Any other plans for, I was going to say, any other plans for Amsterdam as your, before you  head out?  Well, I'm only here, uh, I'm only here tonight, uh, so, I mean, I was, I, I did the gig last  night, so I was only, uh, I only have tonight, and it's like, you know, I'm 45, what am I  going to go over to the fucking red light district?  Oh, by myself. 
[01:53:30]  I think I truly would be a, uh, a pervert at that point.  But I would, I would, I would, I would, I would walk through it just to check it out.  I think they shut a lot of it down.  Isn't it not what it used to be from what I've heard?  Um, I don't know.  I don't, I have, I have no idea.  Look, I'm not going to lie to you.  If, if it's fucking within walkable distance, I will walk through it.  There's just something about a hooker standing in a window and just seeing people walking in  it.  I could never get past it. 
[01:54:00]  That fucking, I mean, it's embarrassing enough to walk out of the old days when you walked  out of a porno store.  Yeah.  To literally just walk out of that.  And then it was the other thing, why I could never pull the trigger to do it.  Cause it wasn't like they weren't beautiful.  It was, it's like when you get with the hooker, you know, she's been with somebody else, but  to literally see the last customer fucking walk.  It was, uh, it was too disgusting.  Right.  Hey, uh, Bill, I saw.  Anyways, the reason why I called up was, uh, you guys know, I don't know that any of the 
[01:54:30]  fans have gotten wind yet.  Like we're doing the second annual, uh, Patrice O'Neal, um, comedy.  Benefit for, uh, for his family and victims, um, of strokes, stroke survivors and that  type of thing.  Once again, it's going to be at the city center.  It's going to be February 18th.  Tickets go on sale on Monday.  Um, I'm going to call in on Monday.  I think I'll be in Ireland at that point.  I'm going to call you guys up and we'll hype the ticket link.  We'll do all that type of stuff.  And as always, I'm hoping, um, but you know, Opie and Anthony, you guys will do the intro 
[01:55:00]  like you did last year and we can kick it off.  And, um, yeah, fuck yeah.  That'll be great.  Do we have anybody else on it?  I mean, obviously you're on it.  I'm on it.  Who else do we have on it?  Do you know?  Oh, it's going to be great.  It's you, me, Colin, Nick DiPaolo, uh, Dane Cook, Bobby Kelly, talent.  Uh, I don't know if you guys know him.  Yeah, I know talent.  Sure.  Um, yeah, he used to do, uh, the Sunday nights at the Boston, the Uptown show. 
[01:55:30]  He's one of the funniest, naturally funniest people I ever met.  You did morning radio for BLS or something like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, who else?  Who else?  I know we got a couple other big guns there.  You know what?  I'll have all the names.  I'll have all the names by, uh.  You just, you just named enough people to sell this thing out.  That's, that's awesome.  Yeah.  Tickets go on sale Monday, you're saying, right?  That's right.  I'm going to call in and I'll have the link.  And Jimmy, I'm going to be sending everybody on the show the link too.  So if you can retweet it.  Of course, yeah.  I'll retweet it to you guys. 
[01:56:00]  And, uh, it's a great thing because, you know, Patrice was supporting his family and his mom and all that type of stuff.  And that's what he would be doing if he was still here.  So, um, we're all his friends and we're not going to drop the ball on that.  So it really means a lot to everybody on the show.  Yeah.  You know, everybody coming up, you know, buying the tickets the way they did last year.  Cause this is something that, you know, I hopefully want to do every year and get people who aren't familiar with Patrice's comedy to know about him.  Cause he was, yeah, I, I, you know, we got to figure it out, but, uh, the people are loving, you know, Patrice on this radio show over the years. 
[01:56:30]  I would love to put out some kind of like Patrice O'Neill radio box set thing with all proceeds.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I, like when people ask me about him, when they ever say, you know, what was he like?  I said, if you want to really see like a, the, the best glimpse you're going to be able to get of what it was like to hang out with that guy, watch the Opie and Anthony clips, because that was him joking around, being silly, philosophizing, um, 
[01:57:00]  being argumentative and that, yeah, getting heated, yeah, getting heated.  Being difficult.  That classic fucking argument.  Right.  It just was the whole, you know, you get, you get a pretty good, and then my favorite one of all time is the, the up and down game.  Oh, Jesus.  I still don't know how you set up a straight face.  He was just losing his fucking mind.  One of the funniest guys ever.  He had the greatest laugh.  Like, like how hard he laughed on that.  That's the hardest I've ever seen him laugh.  I remember like two other times I saw him laugh so hard that I thought he was going to pass out. 
[01:57:30]  I don't know if you were there, Jim.  Do you remember that time, uh, we were standing in front of the Boston and that Asian kid came by with, was carrying that heavy box and Voss walked up to him, asked him what time it was.  And he adjusted the weight on the box.  And right as he looked down at his watch, Voss walked away.  I vaguely remember.  Cause I remember we would do that.  I think I do remember that when Voss.  Yeah.  Yes.  Patrice fucking, he ran down half of the street and was leaning on this parked car across the street. 
[01:58:00]  And you could have heard him on the Upper East Side down in the village.  The look of fucking, the look on the dude's face when he realized Voss was fucking with him was priceless.  He had that, ah, you motherfucker.  The look on his face was unreal.  Whatever.  It was just that, that great laugh that, uh, you know, it sucks, man.  It always gets to that sad point that he's not here, but we're trying to eventually turn this thing into like a celebration. 
[01:58:30]  So, uh, people can remember, you know, just what, what an unbelievable presence he was.  I don't think we'll get it together for this year, but maybe, uh, next, next year when we do the event, we'll try to do that box set.  Cause that'd be awesome to really put it together.  Well, if you want to show, if you want to show a clip, cause last year, you know, I don't know if we, maybe we'll show a lot of the pictures from last year and everything, but if maybe if we can, uh.  Yeah, well, maybe we'll play the video of him laughing his ass off.  The up and down game.  If people understand, cause sometimes people don't understand what's going on. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, no, we'll explain it.  We'll, we'll show that clip this year.  Yeah.  Even the people that have seen a million times, they, they won't mind whatsoever.  Well, we could throw it.  We have plenty of time.  We could just do a quick intro into it.  Uh, if there's any clips that need a quick intro, cause I just found a lot of these tapes that Sam had.  And Sam get, we have the actual original shot tape, which is better quality than it is on YouTube.  Right.  So, uh, I mean, yeah, there's also a way to, to do it where, uh, someone ends their set and then you kind of, you know, boss doesn't come out.  Boss is hosting. 
[01:59:30]  I forgot to bring that up.  Okay.  Maybe you could show him.  This is probably something we should be discussing off the air.  So it's somewhere.  Nah, we're just working it out in front of the people.  Yeah.  We could, we could easily intro, uh, clips and make them work.  So that's easy for us.  All right.  Hey, Bill.  You know, at the theater, there's always, there's always a curfew and a time thing where.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  We'll figure it out.  Hey, Bill, I got to say, I got to kiss your ass.  I saw you at the Beacon Theater recently and I want all the people to know.  I texted you right after the show.  I've been a fan of yours forever, but your comedy is now on a 
[02:00:00]  even bigger fucking better level.  It was unbelievable.  That set, dude.  It was unbelievable.  And I really appreciated your text because, uh, you know, your opinion, you know, obviously  I know you've, you've been around all these great comics over the years that Jim was nice  enough to bring on to the show.  And, uh, right.  So when I got your text, I was psyched.  I showed it to me.  I guess guy doesn't give it up.  No, you were.  No, I mean, I, you know, I try to be fair, but I mean, you, oh my God, you just blew us  away.  We were loving it.  Really smart, clever, hilarious shit. 
[02:00:30]  Ah, yeah.  Well, I, I'm trying to, uh, trying to keep these plates spinning.  Yeah.  I don't think you have a problem with that, my friend.  There's a guy coming along, so.  No.  I'm going to try to, uh, you know.  It was unbelievable.  I appreciate it, man.  Thank you.  All right.  It had to be said because I was, I was like, wow, Bill is fucking doing it, man.  All right.  So we'll, uh, we'll talk to you Monday about, uh, more of the lineup for the Patrice O'Neal  benefit and, and tickets go on sale as well on Monday. 
[02:01:00]  Great.  Okay, cool.  And I'll, I'll get in touch with Roland because I got to figure out with my flight when I can  call in.  All right, buddy.  And I can't wait to hear more of your stories from, uh, the next place you're at.  Beautiful.  All right, Bill.  Bill, the explorer over there.  Talk to you Monday, man.  Yes.  Bill, Bill Burr on Twitter.  Bye, buddy.  Thanks, Bill.  Him exploring.  Yeah.  He does great phoners, man.  Yeah, unbelievable.  Phoners are fucking brutal, man.  They're really hard to do.  Bill's great at them.  Yeah.  Dice is great at them.  There's a few guys that give really good phoners and they're not easy to do. 
[02:01:30]  That's so funny.  Jay Morgan's great phoners.  I didn't know what, like, I didn't know what he was going to say about going to Italy and  going to the, the 16, the 16 Chapel.  Uh, I wasn't sure if it was going to be like, oh my God, it was the most amazing thing or  it sucked.  And apparently it sucked.  I was just, I was a 16 Chapel guy too.  Were you really?  For a while, yeah.  16 Chapel.  I was one of those guys.  I guess I got to admit it now.  I don't even know if Bill, Bill maybe was just making that up, but I definitely was  a 16 Chapel guy. 
[02:02:00]  All right.  We'll, uh, we'll break here.  Should we check in with E-Rock?  Make sure he's.  I do.  Let's check on him.  I'm worried.  Yeah.  Yeah, we should.  And Roro has a call back.  Sure.  Roro having a tough time with food poisoning.  What?  I got pissed badly.  Yeah.  Vibrio Pires.  Tienes el mono. 
[02:02:30]  Roland made it into work.  There's your update.  What did he say?  He took some what?  Kaopecte.  He didn't say it that way.  Oh, did he have to say he said it wrong?  Kaopecte.  Hey, Kaopecte.  Kaopecte.  Kaopecte. 
[02:03:00]  But he is walking a little funny as he walks down the hall.  Like John Wayne, he said.  Yeah, he's still got a little of that John Wayne in his gait.  The Duke, like the Duke.  I want to send an intern out on a mission.  I wanted to steer clear of this, but I've tried and tried, and I just can't find this.  Some compassion?  Yes, compassion, humanity, sanity.  Decency.  Decency.  Decency, all that stuff I can't seem to conjure up in myself. 
[02:03:30]  No, I've been looking all over and making the phone calls to various stores for the wonderful Xbox One.  Nothing.  Nothing.  I figure this is Manhattan.  New York, New York.  The city that never sleeps, right?  So there's got to be one out here somewhere.  Now, this is a good mission for an intern to prove his worth.  We've had this done in the past, where I send out an intern on a various mission to get 
[02:04:00]  me something.  I've done it.  You've done it.  And they then bring it back.  Sometimes they bring it back.  Sometimes they don't bring it back.  But I'm going to be looking for this.  Now, sir, what's your name?  Jim.  I'm Tyler.  That's Tyler.  A voice for radio.  Tyler.  I'm Tyler.  Say it again.  I'm Tyler.  I'm Tyler.  Okay, Tyler.  This is the first time we've heard him speak. 
[02:04:30]  I think so.  He's been interning for how long?  Two months?  Tyler?  Since the girls.  Since August.  This is the first time we've heard him speak.  I know.  He just walks around with that fucking Daniel Lonza smirk.  It's Adam.  Adam, whatever his name is.  I almost said Matt.  Daniel Lonza.  Daniel Lonza.  Adam Lonza.  Adam Lonza.  Adam.  Adam, Adam, Adam.  You stupid idiot.  All right.  I have a mission for you.  Okay.  Now, I hope you can pull this off. 
[02:05:00]  Me too.  Oh, boy.  That didn't sound very confident.  Did you hear what he asked for us?  I know you were making the transition.  No, I did not hear what he asked for.  Okay.  I am going to give you a pocket full of $100 bills.  Whoa.  You are going to go out into the streets of New York City using a phone, various other  things to call ahead, check on availability, and you will return here with...  Not happening.  ...an Xbox One. 
[02:05:30]  He's writing it down.  Xbox One.  He wrote it down.  Xbox One.  One Xbox.  Not one Xbox.  An Xbox One.  Right.  There you go.  You asked for one Xbox.  I got you an Xbox.  And he comes back with the 360.  That's a good one.  I got a 360.  Yeah.  Finally, Sam can make fun of someone's voice.  Yeah.  He's weird on the after show when he came in and I wanted to make fun of his voice.  How much are these fucking things? 
[02:06:00]  $500, I think.  Give him six.  Okay.  Here's six hundies.  So you're having trouble finding one, or...?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Keep in mind, this is the same intern class that couldn't find Cinnamon Toast in New York City.  Oh, Jesus.  Yes, I'm having trouble finding one.  I've called many Game Stops.  Sure.  Now, but I live out on Long Island.  Mm-hmm.  I've called some Game Stops, Best Buys, things like that. 
[02:06:30]  Stores that would normally have Xbox Ones.  But because of Christmas, the availability is very, very, you know, limited.  Okay.  So your mission will be to make a few phone calls, I guess, do a little phone call recon  first to various stores in the local area, and then if you get a hit on one of these,  you then go down there, lay out the cash, grab that big, beautiful Xbox One box, and 
[02:07:00]  bring it back here for me to take home and enjoy on my weekend.  All right.  I will see what I can do.  And he has to, what, 10 a.m. Eastern Standard Time?  Yes.  10 by 10.  You've got to be back here with either the Xbox or the money, because I'm, you know, I get  the fuck out of here.  Yes.  Anthony assured him that he would be back with an Xbox or the money.  Here it is.  Also, this is 600.  I guess, what is it, 500? 
[02:07:30]  It's 500.  Something like that.  Whatever you pick it up for, you can keep the change.  So, it's, but if you just come back with the money and no Xbox, you get nothing.  That's right.  See, that's your incentive to find this fucking thing and return it to me by 10 o'clock.  All right.  All right.  There he goes.  That's not going to work.  All right.  What do you think?  There's not a chance.  There's no fucking way.  There's no fucking way.  No way.  Sam is saying no fucking way.  He actually said after all that, wait, you're having trouble finding one. 
[02:08:00]  I know.  Finding one.  Having trouble finding one.  Yes.  I know, like Richard Dreyfuss.  Yeah.  I got here this morning.  Richard Dreyfuss in his voice.  I got here this morning, and in the elevator banks where they just replaced the floor and everything.  Yeah.  He was sitting on the floor in the elevator bank.  Why?  And I go, what are you doing?  And he was like, I'm waiting for the newspapers.  All right.  How else is he supposed to wait for the newspapers?  You should be fucking picky around here.  You should be doing other stuff.  Doing his duty. 
[02:08:30]  And check every couple minutes.  You shouldn't have time to sit on the floor.  You want to grab him as soon as that elevator door opened.  For what?  You guys aren't even here yet.  I am.  I'm sitting here without papers.  We like crisp newspapers in this radio show.  Wouldn't that be great if he came back all coked out and drunk and said he lost the money?  Yeah.  And he was fucking fucked up.  Yeah.  God.  He's all fucked up.  He painted black marker like he got punched under his eye.  Okay.  He's got a bad story.  He's all fucking coked out. 
[02:09:00]  It would be the first time with an intern.  I know.  Well, you're a liar.  Well, I have to have some faith in our youth.  We'll see what happens.  I'm going to say he'll bring it back.  All right.  We've got an hour.  This is going to be a terrific bit.  Not happening.  It's going to be a terrific bit.  Oh, it is?  Is this going to happen?  No way.  He's on the clock.  People are not going to be able to turn off their radios.  Oh, exactly.  We gave him a reason to listen until 10.  That's right.  He's coming back with six crispy bills.  Boy.  He probably won't even leave the building.  No.  All right.  I've got three stories in front of me worth doing today.  Oh.  I guess we will do material finally. 
[02:09:30]  Huh?  We've got the Metro North update.  Who cares?  We've got the latest thing they're banning at skeels.  All right.  That's pretty interesting stuff.  And, wow, a mother unwittingly live tweets something.  Wait, wait.  Man unwittingly live tweets something?  Woman.  Mother.  Woman.  Mother?  It says mother.  It is a woman, obviously, yes.  A woman.  But I think I know that story.  Well, you only get to pick one. 
[02:10:00]  No, maybe not.  But unwittingly.  We shred the other two.  So pick wisely.  Is it the one with the woman stuck in traffic?  Yeah.  Okay.  No?  It's brutal, though.  It's not that story?  Yeah, she was stuck in traffic.  You're shaking your head.  She wasn't stuck in traffic.  She was home.  Oh.  But I think it's the same story.  All right.  I think the details are just confused.  Is it the one where her husband's dead?  Yeah.  All right.  Jesus, fuck.  Fucking code.  What is it?  I know.  What the fuck?  A Washington state woman live tweeted a violent crash. 
[02:10:30]  That's why I think she was in traffic.  I think she was in traffic.  Thank you.  Because it says she live tweeted a violent crash.  She was following a...  She's like...  She's a big, like, scanner.  Yeah.  Oh.  See?  Oh.  That's where I make my mistake.  I only read the first couple sentences of a story.  I thought she was stuck in the traffic jam that the accident caused.  No.  No.  She was in the car, and she live tweeted it, and she flew through the windshield while  twittering.  Oh.  Eee.  Wow.  That car got fucked up. 
[02:11:00]  So she's live tweeting a violent crash that killed her husband on a busy interstate  without knowing he was the victim until the bitter end.  And I have a lot of problems with this story, though.  Huh?  Yeah.  She really loves her Twitter account.  Oh, she's so good.  And there was a time during this, uh, the details here where she probably should have  tapped out of tweeting.  Stop tweeting.  Uh, the crash happened about 1.40 Wednesday on Interstate 205 in Vancouver.  Seconds later, avid Twitter user Karen Johnson, using the handle ScanCover, started tweeting 
[02:11:30]  about the wreck.  I hate that section of I, uh, 205.  Uh, too many on-ramps, speeders, and too few lanes, she wrote.  The mom of two is a devoted scanner freak.  See?  That was the, that was the sixth line down.  That's a lot of reading.  That is.  God, she's awful.  And would often tweet about police activity.  Well, when investigating, uh, cops learned that someone had died in the two-car accident,  she expressed her sympathy.  She tweeted, oh my God, that is so horrible. 
[02:12:00]  But then she started to worry because her husband, Craig Johnson, 47, trials that same  road and was late getting home from work.  I'm trying not to panic.  So this was another tweet.  I'm trying not to panic, but my husband left work early and he drives 205 to get home.  He's not answering his phone and he's late.  Her fear mounted as she failed to reach him.  Well, he uses his Bluetooth, so he would answer his phone.  He also wasn't feeling good, so his work was concerned when he left, she tweeted, adding,  I'm a basket case.  She called work to confirm he left, and her terror only grew.  So then, of course, she has to tweet more. 
[02:12:30]  When you tap out at this point?  Yeah.  She tweets, I just called his work and he was feeling faint when he left work.  Panic.  Hashtag panic.  Uh, how long do I wait?  She had to add a hashtag to it.  It's fucking amazing.  She's hashtagging.  What an annoying Twitter woman.  Yeah, at this point, if you got, like, that strong of a suspicion, you might as well,  like, you know, go try to figure some shit out.  Yeah, put an LOL in there.  Yeah, LOL.  How long do I wait for him to come home before I call the police, she wrote.  I just called 911 and they transferred me after I gave them his license number and told me 
[02:13:00]  that they will call me back, uh, WTF?  Question mark.  And now my kids are home from school, she wrote, in a series of panicky tweets.  That's unbelievable.  Just living her dumb fucking life out on Twitter.  Right.  Like, moment by moment.  She finally got the bad news when cops informed her it was her husband who was killed.  So she tweeted that?  She tweeted, it's him, he died.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's repulsive.  Hashtag insurance.  Yeah.  Yes. 
[02:13:30]  Right.  Johnson's northbound car crossed a grassy median and slammed head-on into a Toyota pickup.  He probably fainted or something if he wasn't feeling well.  That's right.  Maybe a little, uh, hearty.  Yeah.  Or he was medicated or something.  He might have had a hearty.  Oh, right.  And he was pronounced dead at the scene.  Uh, the woman driving the Toyota survived, so.  But she tweeted the whole fucking thing.  We're losing our minds with our social media.  Yep.  It's crazy.  Yeah, why? 
[02:14:00]  Like, you'd think she would get on the phone.  Of course.  All the fucking authorities.  Of course.  Born to Run.  Wow.  The handwritten Born to Run lyrics.  Yeah?  What'd they go for?  $197,000 at auction.  It's not even that great a song.  Born to Run is a great song.  Maybe show, show to me.  He's better song.  It's, you know, it's overplayed, so that might trick you a little bit.  But that's a really great rock song.  Oh.  You never liked it, huh?  Yeah.  I like, uh, I told you Youngstown. 
[02:14:30]  I'm like, yeah, this is just okay.  Off of this.  Yeah, but when you first hear it before, I mean, our perspective is we've heard it a million times at this point.  Yeah.  It's his mission statement.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's it about, car racing or something?  I don't give a fuck.  It's about Jersey.  Of course it is. 
[02:15:00]  Another thing went, uh, you should have went for the Han Solo gun, man.  Yeah?  The blaster?  What'd that go for?  200.  200 G?  What?  It's not for sale.  Really?  Oh, that's the starting price.  200 G's?  Oh my God.  I thought they got 200,000.  That's going to be huge.  Maybe no one will bid on it.  Wow.  Yeah, maybe.  Why don't you go to 100,000 and, uh, $1?  Yeah, that'll get outbid real quick.  I'm surprised you're not, you know, getting in on some of these gun auctions, though, in general. 
[02:15:30]  There's been a few of these over the years.  Yeah.  200,000.  That's a lot of fucking cash.  Dude, that's the blaster, though.  That's the fucking...  That's the shit.  Yeah.  And all it was back in the day was some dumb little who-gives-a-fuck prop.  Oh, it probably just looks like shit.  Right.  It didn't even look good.  The description specifically mentions non-firing.  Well.  Oh, thank goodness.  I didn't think some green plasma-like goop fired out of it.  Yeah, maybe you could shoot the fucking elephant piano player with a fucking monster. 
[02:16:00]  I like Jimmy's impression of fucking George Lucas drivel.  Think of the toys you can sell.  Oh, that's pretty much what he thought of.  There it is.  Look at that.  Just sit.  Oh, it does just look like shit.  It looks like shit.  It really does.  A child's toy.  Yeah.  Pew, pew.  What do you do, though?  Now you have it in your house and you go, hey, you want to see?  Glass case.  You want to see?  Set it up with a picture.  Yeah. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  But wouldn't you just be worried all the time that someone's going to fucking try to take  it from you?  Yeah.  So those type of things you've got to put in a vault.  You don't even get to really enjoy it anymore.  No, it's a weak salary.  Who the fuck needs to lose that?  Maybe for you.  Yeah.  You insure it.  You would need your homeowner's insurance.  Your big policy.  You almost said homo.  Homo insurance.  You almost said it.  Yeah.  Anthony has that.  If he gives it and sucks a cock, they have to pay him money.  Oh, I'm rich.  So Metro North is trying to cover their ass. 
[02:17:00]  Oh.  We got that big derailment that happened.  Four people dead.  What?  Almost 70 people injured.  What?  He was barreling at 82 miles an hour when he was supposed to be going 30 around the curve.  Most people know the story by now.  Yeah.  It's a biggie here in New York City, obviously.  Yeah.  Metro North derailment engineer to undergo evaluation for sleep disorder.  Oh.  Disorder.  Of course.  So that'll help the lawsuits, right?  It's all positioning now.  I think we...  I guess we need a lawyer.  Where's our lawyer friend? 
[02:17:30]  He was amazing.  Which one?  I always forget his name.  They bring him up from time to time.  What are you...  Character?  Yeah, character.  Character.  What do you do?  Character?  What do you do for a living?  If he's out there somewhere, call the show.  We love you.  We really do.  But I think this is posturing for lawsuits, right?  Yeah.  Well, they want to...  Because if he has a real disorder, maybe that'll help them in court.  Well, they also want to know what to do with him, because if he has a medical disorder, how...  But wouldn't they have known by now?  No, not necessarily.  Not necessarily.  Sleep apnea may have caused the locomotive engineer in the deadly Metro North crash to zone out just before the train tumbled off the tracks. 
[02:18:00]  Maybe.  I mean, that's maybe what his lawyer is suggesting he do.  But it would be something, some type of a defense.  He's criminally negligent.  This is not just about getting sued.  This is about going to jail, too.  And if he literally has sleep apnea, and it's for real, and maybe it's narcoleptic or whatever, then, A, he shouldn't be doing that for a living.  Yeah.  But that...  I hate to say it.  It's a smart lawyer.  Oh, yeah.  Because the lawyer that's on this case is like, holy fuck. 
[02:18:30]  And then he looks at the guy, probably a little out of shape and stuff, and is like, thinking, go get a sleep study, man.  If you've got sleep apnea, we could work that shit.  But if he has it, I don't think you can fake it, because the tests know when you're asleep, and they can tell when you're guessing.  Yeah, but most of us, if we went for the sleep test, would probably find out we have some form of sleep apnea, right?  The numbers would be pretty damn high.  Um, maybe, but I mean, they would know how many times an hour you wake up, and when you're in REM sleep.  Like, you can't fake that test.  And see, I swear I didn't read this, and it's the next line.  Portly people like Rockefeller are more prone to suffer from sleep apnea. 
[02:19:00]  Portly.  So there's a guy going, oh my god, wait a minute.  You might be a sleep apnea guy.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  I know I am.  He's on unpaid leave, and he's staying out of sight, and he's staying out of sight since the crash.  I think that's your update.  He's out of sight.  There's no reason they should be complimenting this guy.  He just did a good job.  That's out of sight.  Complimenting him in the 70s. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, okay.  And the FAA recently announced a plan to screen overweight and obese pilots for the condition,  and ground those who have it until they are treated by a sleep expert.  Now, I guarantee you fat people will fight that in court and go,  you know, it's just a medical disability.  You can't single us out.  Yes.  They do get a little touchy.  Mm.  Yeah.  Like a cake-eating motherfuckers. 
[02:20:00]  Reverend Al just looks really strange.  Look, he's standing with all those people.  That is unbelievable how tiny he is now.  It's unbelievable that you'd want that as the face of your network.  Yeah.  Fucking MSNBC, these dummies.  Well, what are you going to do?  They couldn't get him on the air quick enough for this Mandela thing.  Well, who else are they going to get?  Yeah, I don't know.  Well, they got everybody.  Charlie Rangel came out.  What do you want to hear from?  Chuck Scarborough?  Jesse Jackson.  They got the Tom Brokaw. 
[02:20:30]  Tom Brokaw.  Nelson Mandela.  Mandela.  The face of Al-Africa apartheid.  Yeah.  Obama had some nice things to say about Mandela.  Did he?  Surprising.  And what, now he's admitting he lived with his uncle or something?  I guess that's a big deal.  Well, it's not a real big deal.  Just shows him that he said.  But they said he was never asked. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, is that it?  It was an oversight.  He was never asked in 2011.  So they finally asked him.  Who said that?  Some guy.  Maybe it's the wrong question.  Did Jay Carney say that?  As he was standing at that podium, picking each word as if he mentions the wrong one,  fucking arrows will fly at him.  He basically said, well, you guys never asked.  Never asked?  Hey.  Did they never ask?  No, I don't know.  Sounds fine.  Here's what he had to say about Mandela. 
[02:21:30]  At his trial in 1964, Nelson Mandela closed his statement from the doc, saying,  I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination.  I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together  in harmony and with equal opportunities.  It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. 
[02:22:00]  But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.  And Nelson Mandela lived for that ideal, and he made it real.  He achieved more than could be expected of any man.  And today, he's gone home.  And we've lost one of the most influential, courageous, and profoundly good human beings  that any of us will share time with on this earth. 
[02:22:30]  He no longer belongs to us.  He belongs to the ages.  Oh, that's a good one.  Damn, that's fucking strong.  We come too far!  That was a good speech.  Well, he continued.  Oh.  Just a little more.  We will not likely see the likes of Nelson Mandela again.  I think you're right.  They were all different.  So it falls to us as we can before the example that he set.  Or zombie Mandela.  Good point. 
[02:23:00]  To make decisions guided not by hate, but by love.  Well, maybe we can make a Mandela balloon.  Mandela balloon.  Never discount the difference that one person can make.  Floating around a little bit.  To strive for a future that is worthy of his sacrifice.  For now, let us pause and give thanks.  The fact that Nelson Mandela lived.  A man who took history in his hands.  A negro.  And bent the arc of the moral universe towards justice.  May God bless his memory and keep him in peace. 
[02:23:30]  I lick my sweaty balls.  Jesus.  A great man.  Jesus Christ.  A lot of people mourning today.  Yes, yes.  Yeah.  Lots of mourning.  So wait a minute.  Someone said, please tell Ant.  Called and offered to give Ant my brand new Xbox One first edition.  And the rude screener said, okay, cool.  And hung up.  All right.  Well.  Oh, boy. 
[02:24:00]  What, buddy?  That's not the right thing to do.  Who's the screener?  Trav?  It was Sal.  And Sal's admitting to it.  He thought he was fucking around.  Sal made a quick judgment with his smooth skin.  But what made you think he was fucking around, Sal?  His demeanor on the phone.  His demeanor on the phone.  Maybe he just doesn't have proper phone manners.  He's profiling.  He's obviously a gamer.  So those people don't have...  Sal?  I never knew he was a mer.  Have the guy call back and I'll feel it. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, God.  Now you're going to get a hundred guys calling back.  Exactly.  Sal, you blew it.  They never played properly, these fucks out there.  Fuck me out of an Xbox.  Exactly.  The phones will be lit in a matter of a minute when the delay kicks in.  Everybody had like five of the lawyer guys.  What a surprise.  I'm fucking...  I'm the lawyer.  I'm the lawyer.  I'm the lawyer.  Okay.  Someone calls in about a box and Sal fumbles it.  Right.  I'm not shocked at all.  Oh, and then you get this.  The new Xbox is junk. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, it's junk.  Why don't you shut up?  Exactly.  Put it in the trunk.  God.  Get it.  I'm waiting for the delay to be over because these phones are going to be lit.  Everyone's going to have your Xbox.  Of course.  Fucking Sal.  Yeah, you guys are just talking about me on the air?  Thanks.  Yeah, I got the Xbox.  Yeah, thanks.  Click.  Yeah, what ads?  Fucking Sal.  Cost me an Xbox right there.  That's okay.  The intern will be coming back shortly with one.  Yeah.  Well, he hasn't left yet.  Then here we go.  What do you mean he hasn't left yet? 
[02:25:30]  He's on the phone probably.  Sal, I'll take it from here.  You should have other people making calls.  Hi, who's this?  Hi.  Yeah.  I have an Xbox One for Anthony.  Were you the guy that called earlier, I guess?  Fuck no.  I have another one, though.  Wow.  Hi, who's this?  Hey, it's Will from Phoenix.  Were you the guy that...  Yeah.  No, no, no.  Tell Ant, because I don't have an Xbox to offer, tell Ant to call Video Games New York.  It's there in the city.  That's where I used to get all my stuff.  I'd get it early, too. 
[02:26:00]  So...  All right.  Hopefully the intern knows that.  I'll tell you what.  That is the best video game store in the city.  Why?  It's an independent game store.  They usually put stuff for sale early.  They've got a lot of questions.  Oh.  Okay.  Good to know.  All right.  Well, the phones are now lit with everyone offering you a fake Xbox One.  Yeah, I know.  What do you mean?  They're not...  I don't think they're sincere.  Well, I don't know.  Let's see.  Hi, who's this?  Nick from Indiana.  Hey, Nick.  What do you got? 
[02:26:30]  Okay.  Hi, who's this?  Oh, boy.  Huh?  Hello?  Hi.  Hi, who's this?  Yeah, this is John.  I want to give Anthony my Xbox.  Of course you do.  Cool.  Told you.  Yeah.  I'm in.  How much?  $600.  Oh, what a deal.  A great deal.  It's like eBay.  They're going for like $20,000.  $20,000?  Yeah. 
[02:27:00]  I figured $600 is an awesome deal.  That's a great deal.  Yeah.  I'm right on it.  All right.  Let's go to this guy.  Some guy from Tennessee.  Hi.  Who's this?  Hi.  I'm calling from Tennessee, y'all.  Yeah?  What do you got?  It's going to be fucking hilarious.  I got an Xbox for Ant.  You got an Xbox for me, Lyle?  Yeah.  I got a fucking new Xbox.  How much?  Uh, $500. 
[02:27:30]  I can't think.  What's a good number?  $50,000 or something.  $50,000?  That's...  I'll give it to you for free.  Oh, for free?  Nice.  All right.  What is so...  Did he not me?  He nodded me?  Damn it.  Oh.  Topsucker.  I got nothing for you.  Oh, Lyle.  Why would you do that?  Piece of garbage.  I'm a piece of garbage. 
[02:28:00]  You're a piece of shit.  He's gone.  Is he the one that tweeted?  Maybe.  I don't know.  Maybe.  Or a while.  Here comes Jimmy.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Then we've got to get into the latest thing.  Schools are banning.  Ah!  I want to get that benchwarming story, too, from the other day.  We could, like, put this together in a nice little segment.  Yes.  Douchey things that they're trying to do at SKULE. 
[02:28:30]  At SKULE.  So, if we can find that story real fast, Sam, okay?  Yes.  It's the benchwarming legislation they want to put in place.  All right.  But first, this.  Yeah.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Not here. 
[02:29:00]  Damn.  Funky.  Well.  We're back.  Yes.  What the hell is this?  Wow.  Arcade Fire.  Oh.  Is this off their new album?  Yes, it is.  How good is it?  Very good.  I love the last one.  Very good.  But I'm tapping on a music lately. 
[02:29:30]  I can't do that to myself.  You should come back in.  Do you like Arcade Fire?  No.  Noel Gallagher.  Huh?  Yeah, Noel Gallagher.  Noel Gallagher doesn't think they're very good.  Oh, really?  What is he saying?  He believes they're shit disco.  Oh, go fuck yourself already.  He wrote, like, the longest, just year-end rant.  Right.  This is kind of disco-y.  It is.  It's kind of disco-y.  That's why I didn't know it was Arcade Fire.  They changed their song. 
[02:30:00]  Damn, very good.  Do you want to hear the actual song?  No, it's cool.  Noel wrote, anybody that comes back with a double album to me needs to pry themselves out of their own asshole.  This is not the 70s, okay?  Go ask Billy Corgan about a double album.  I'm all in with Noel Gallagher.  Pry yourself out of your asshole.  And I'll tell you why.  The double album is just ridiculous at this point.  Just make it two separate albums, and then maybe don't wait as long.  Give the fans six months, and then you put out the second half of what would have been the double album. 
[02:30:30]  I'm with him.  He goes, uh...  What was the last great double album in rock?  Let's, um...  Double album.  Last great double album.  Or let's just go with...  Is there a list online?  Again, I would love to know what, like, the top ten greatest double albums were.  Yeah.  Because in most cases, they blow it by putting too much material out there, and it waters down some of the other great songs on it. 
[02:31:00]  I can name you two great ones.  Kiss Alive, Kiss Alive 2.  Oh, right.  Now, of course, they're going to put Peter Frampton.  But were those great double albums?  Or did it get a little weak because there were too many songs?  Frampton Comes Alive?  Kiss Alive was.  It was Kiss Alive 2.  He did three sides, and then the fourth side was new material.  Okay.  Only had really one...  Oh, there's an actual list?  Yeah, there's a classic rock list.  Oh, that's fair enough.  That works.  All right, top ten greatest double albums of all time.  Oh.  Ten is Tusk by Fleetwood Mac.  Dan, dan, dan.  Dan, dan, dan. 
[02:31:30]  Dan, dan, dan.  I like that song.  Dan, dan, dan, dan.  Wait, wait, wait.  We're going to slow down with this.  What were some of the songs on Tusk?  Tusk.  I know that one.  Oh, they don't tell you in the list?  I think number one is The White Album.  Oh, you don't have to do that.  That's fine, then.  Huh?  I'm guessing number one is going to be The White Album.  Oh, fuck.  Okay.  That's a strong one.  Tommy.  I liked Tommy all the way through.  It's a good album.  All right.  The Wall.  All right.  Oh, The Wall was on there. 
[02:32:00]  That's like three 1979 albums right there.  Yeah, this is all from 79.  Well, that's why Noel Gallagher said what he said.  Physical Graffiti.  Oh, fuck.  I look like a fucking moron.  This is all from the 70s, though.  Yeah, but they're all great double albums.  I couldn't even think of any when I brought up this topic.  Shut up, Marge.  Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I didn't know this was a double album.  A lot of these I didn't know.  Physical Graffiti, I wouldn't have known.  Layla and other assorted love songs.  Derek and Domino's.  Come on.  Shit. 
[02:32:30]  Garbage.  Crap.  Electric Ladyland.  The Jimi Hendrix Experience.  Okay.  That's the best of shit.  It's not him.  He's dead.  The Beatles' White Album.  See, they had to be cool and not make it number one.  That's why I hate lists.  I guarantee you it's Peter Frampton.  Number one will be...  You can't beat the White Album.  Oh, Peter Frampton does.  Number two.  Number two is Blonde on Blonde.  Nice.  A little Dylan action.  Bob Dylan.  I can handle that.  Oh, and number one. 
[02:33:00]  Exile on Main Street.  Rolling Stones.  Holy...  That was a monster, Exile on Main Street.  Okay.  Fair enough.  Wait, is that better than the White Album?  Now, that's a debate worth having.  White Album versus Exile on Main Street.  You got the Stones going against the Beatles, man.  That's some heavy-duty shit right there.  Bay City Rollers never put out a double album?  Oh, they were so good.  Should have been that.  Saturday night.  Who doesn't love the fucking Bay City Rollers?  S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y. 
[02:33:30]  Night.  Smashing Pumpkins, of course.  Melancholy and the Infinite Sadness.  That might be the last great double album.  GNR?  GNR?  Use your illusion, but that's...  I mean, that would have been one amazing album if they cut it down.  Most of these double albums.  Like, if you cut it down, it'd be one, like you said...  Ridiculous.  ...unbelievable album.  Yeah.  You know what wasn't a good double album?  Oh.  Stadium Arcadium.  Who's that?  By Red Hot Chili Peppers.  Oh, yeah.  That was a double.  That's right.  It was 28 songs.  Oh, my God. 
[02:34:00]  I could deal with two Red Hot Chili Peppers songs.  I think they tell me.  Most motherfuckers don't go downstairs.  Noel Gallagher, I think, says it best when he's talking about Arcade Fire and their double  album.  All right.  Say it again.  Well, he continues.  Oh, he continues.  He says, who has the fucking time in 2013 to sit through 45 minutes of a single album?  How arrogant are these people to think that you've got an hour and a half to listen to  their fucking record?  I went from hating him to loving him.  That's...  I like it. 
[02:34:30]  These are very...  Right up front.  ...good points.  And then I guess Arcade Fire wants their fans to dress nicely for their shows.  Why?  It's like hipster shit.  Well, fair enough.  You should look good when you're going to see those guys.  When you're going to a disco shit fucking concert.  Right.  Noel Gallagher had a different opinion than you.  Oh, he did?  Who's Noel Gallagher?  From Oasis.  What does Noel say?  Noel said, well, what's the point of that?  Do you know what the point of that is?  That is to take away from the shit disco that's coming out of the speakers.  Because everybody's dressed as one of the three musketeers on acid. 
[02:35:00]  Why did I say fuck Noel Gallagher?  He's right in my wheelhouse.  I love this guy.  That's funny.  He hates his brother.  Does he still hate his brother?  This week so.  Yeah.  And which one could do the Oasis songs?  And which guy has to do them as another band?  I think Noel Gallagher can do the Oasis songs, but he can't sing them as well, because he  would write them.  Right.  He was mostly the writer.  And then the other Gallagher would sing all the songs.  And made them huge hits, but he can't sing them as Oasis, I think. 
[02:35:30]  Right.  Liam Gallagher sings Oasis songs with his new band.  Right.  Really?  He used to not even sing Oasis songs.  Right.  But then the new shit wasn't working too well, so he had to sneak a few in there.  Right.  He did.  Champagne Supernova.  At that last Summer Olympics.  There's something like that.  One of the big stadiums.  Champagne Supernova.  A Champagne Supernova.  I'm not a fan of that.  You don't like Oasis?  No.  Shut up.  Why would you tell me to shut up?  It's whiny music.  I love Oasis.  I do too. 
[02:36:00]  I gotta go a little deeper with the band.  Maybe discover some more gems.  Good singles.  That first record.  The hits are good.  That entire first record.  Stop getting fucking whinging.  We've done this break.  He isn't here today.  He would have told us that we've done this break a few times.  No, he took the day.  Personal day.  Set up for the party tomorrow.  Sleep well.  Get a good night's sleep.  Is this the part where we talk about the unplugged, where Liam Gallagher was in the audience 
[02:36:30]  throwing beer bottles at...  I don't know.  One brother was throwing shit at the other brother.  Yeah.  Whichever one.  That's all you need to know.  Who's the real problem there?  Which brother do you think?  I think...  Well, I guess...  I think they're both...  Yeah, because I was gonna say Liam, but Noel is obviously not a nice guy.  I think Noel is more of a dick than Liam.  Well, Noel's a dick because he writes all these songs and he gets no credit for it.  Right.  And Liam's like a diva.  Yeah.  Like, Noel's an asshole. 
[02:37:00]  Wasn't Liam like the pretty boy out of the two brothers?  Liam's the pretty boy who sings.  And Noel...  Alright.  Noel was just the songwriting guitarist.  Right.  Who got no respect.  I saw Oasis once in Philly.  Or outside Philly.  I fucking loved it.  Look at Liam Galaxian.  Hey, look.  He looks more like a rock star.  Oh, God.  Is he a fucking douche, though?  Look at that.  He looks like a douche.  Dumb fucking pursed lips.  Yeah.  He's way cooler than anything you could imagine.  And Noel just beat the shit out of you over the dumbest thing. 
[02:37:30]  Just some mundane thing.  What else does he say?  Is that it?  He looks like fucking Chris Hardwick.  Yeah.  In that photo.  Wow.  Absolutely.  Very good.  That's all he's quoted as in this.  Can we find more Noel Gallagher quotes?  I do like those quotes.  He is a prick.  Maybe there's a top ten Noel Gallagher quotes thing.  You really don't like this? 
[02:38:00]  Nah.  What's your name?  I don't know.  What is that?  It's a champagne supernova in the sky.  What it looks like when I cum.  In your eye.  I'll play my lip.  He's just a miserable man.  They asked him, like, how was 2013?  And he said, this is Noel Gallagher.  Yeah.  He said, all I've done is sit around the house and become a fucking hypochondriac.  Dogshit year.  Can't wait until it's over. 
[02:38:30]  I like this guy.  He's honest.  He's great.  And what?  He talks about all the albums that came out?  Does he say something about Kanye West?  He loved Yeezus.  He loved Yeezus.  Who doesn't?  I don't know.  There was some talent that didn't love him.  Yeah.  He only got 25%.  He had 4,000 people in a 19,000 arena.  Wasn't that in Alaska?  Oh, no.  No, it was down in...  You're thinking of Pitbull.  It was down south of here, right?  St. Lou? 
[02:39:00]  Oh, shit.  Where the fuck was it?  I want to say Indianapolis.  No, that's not down.  Fuck.  What was it?  Kansas City?  Kansas.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think it was.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was.  It was Kansas City.  Kansas City?  It was a bust for him.  Yeah, but then everybody's like saying that he's a failure now.  He just did four nights of sold-out shows in New York.  He had a bad gig.  That's all I'm going to do.  Sorry, Kansas City.  I think a lot of times when the numbers are that bad, the artist comes up with some wonderful 
[02:39:30]  excuse so they don't look like idiots.  And I guess Kanye chose not to go down that road, so you've got to respect him for that.  Yeah.  He did the gig.  Because they start looking at the numbers.  They go, you know what?  You now have food poisoning.  We've got to fucking cancel this thing.  You boys are supposed to be building a railroad.  You're jumping around like a bunch of Kansas City faggots.  You know, I had some good news, by the way, about Anthony's Xbox.  I was apparently incorrect.  Because I went out there before to go to the bathroom, which was like, you know, probably 
[02:40:00]  920.  And the intern was on the computer.  And he was on Craigslist.  No, he's not.  No, you're kidding.  He was on Craigslist.  I'm not fucking getting a Craigslist.  You're kidding.  Come on.  Craigslist.  Come on.  He was on Craigslist.  You don't buy a fucking Craigslist Xbox.  Well, apparently your money does.  That's how you get robbed.  He might get killed.  That would be nice.  Craigslist.  Yeah.  Craigslist.  He's going to have a ball gag in his mouth. 
[02:40:30]  Craigslist, the Bronx.  You want to hear what Noel Gallagher thought of Lady Gaga's art pot?  Who's that?  I can't say.  A guy from our past.  Who?  He was just a fucking liar.  Who?  He had to change his name.  And he works here now.  PD.  He knows.  We look at each other.  I just go, yeah.  I actually did that in his face a couple weeks ago.  I don't want to say on air.  I wish I knew. 
[02:41:00]  He was one of our PDs.  And when we were syndicated to regular radio, he just lied through his teeth.  And he didn't really want the show.  Tim Sabian?  No.  He didn't really want the show.  And our listeners started calling us up, going, look, they're just not running the show.  So then I would call the guy.  And I'm like, hey, man, we're getting fucking fans from all over the place saying they're just not hearing the show.  And he would just lie and say, no, they don't know what the fuck they're talking about.  And then he had some problems.  And then the problems were so bad. 
[02:41:30]  And I have to talk vague because I don't feel like getting sued.  They were so bad that he actually changed his name.  And then this company hired him.  Wow.  Of course.  Can you mouth what city it was?  I'll tell you off air.  But I think that was enough for the listeners to have an interest.  But my problem was, all right, you should have been honest.  You didn't want the show.  We would have figured something out.  Because this particular market, we easily could have got the show on somewhere else.  But he kind of started burying the show. 
[02:42:00]  And then he goes, oh, well, you know, he started making another time slot for it real late in the night.  What?  I don't know.  I suck at reading lips.  No, it wasn't.  No, they loved us up in Chicago.  Huh?  No, Chicago, the PD in Chicago really did love us.  Nope.  Not the West Palm.  I would have thought that, too.  Fair enough.  Here we go.  I like this.  No, fair enough.  I'll do this for you. 
[02:42:30]  But it was mostly this, but we were hurting these two markets.  Oh, okay.  I never would have known that.  Okay.  Yeah.  And, you know, yeah.  And I called them out.  I'm like, dude, what's going on?  He goes, nothing, man.  I don't know what they're talking about.  I'm like, I'm getting so many people emailing us and calling us.  Slick.  Wasn't Slick?  Who was Slick?  Who was Slick?  I had a pull slim.  Remember Slick?  The guy with the hair and the suit.  I swear to God, I don't remember Slick.  We used to call him Slick.  Oh.  Remember that guy? 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  The hair and the suit.  We'd call him Slick.  Yeah.  We used to call him Slick.  Steve Blatter?  Do you remember his name?  I don't remember his name.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No.  He was the guy with, like, the corporate look.  Yeah.  He's doing very well, actually, that guy.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's like a big shot with Clear Channel now.  Big, way up there.  But that guy that just walked by.  Just lied through.  Oh, he walked by.  He was on TV.  Yeah, every time I see him, I just go, ugh.  Because he's just slimy. 
[02:43:30]  And, you know, he got into some shit, too.  Oh.  He got into.  Oh, God.  Oh.  Now this is, like, two insides.  All right.  Now, is this Ian Watkins type shit?  Oh, that's easy to figure out.  Oh.  Big time.  So then he had to kind of change his name.  Oh, okay.  So he could work again.  Hmm.  Yep.  I got to keep it vague, because those are the type of people that will absolutely fucking  sue you.  Okay.  But I'd have to see him in the halls.  Like, really? 
[02:44:00]  I get it.  Well, we were syndicated, and we didn't expect every city to like us.  A lot of them certainly did and worked the show properly, and we were very successful.  But the guy at West Palm Beach hated our fucking guts.  Yeah.  And he felt like he was forced to put the show on the air.  Do you remember that fucking trip?  There was no signage for the show at all when we went down there?  It was so uncomfortable.  I'm like, why are we here?  We get it.  Why are we wasting our time down here if you don't want us here?  He did not want us here.  They kind of threw us in a room, and then he put us on stage for their big festival when  it just completely didn't matter. 
[02:44:30]  Remember that?  It was like a throwaway.  It was just to have you intro the band.  There was nothing with the show.  Oh, it was awful.  Remember?  And then we did the show from their actual studio, and it was so uncomfortable, because  you could tell everyone was just like, eh, whatever.  What are you guys leaving?  Yeah.  The fun of syndication.  Yeah.  And then you go to other cities, and it was like, unbelievable.  You're getting police escorts and all sorts of fun shit.  Right?  Remember?  Yeah.  Cleveland was always great.  Take care of us.  Cleveland was amazing. 
[02:45:00]  Buffalo picked us up in a, I think it was a 1982 limo.  Remember the fucking horrible limo?  Yeah.  To take us down to the beach party.  But then they had people in route with signs and stuff that they'd set up just to make  us feel fucking pretty good about ourselves.  I love that.  All right.  Craigslist, huh?  Oh, yeah.  So back to that.  I was on Craigslist.  Sorry about that.  No, no.  I was just blurting that out.  Any update on that?  I mean, just based on my own research, real quick, you're not going to get one before 
[02:45:30]  Sunday.  Yeah, I told that that.  All the Best Buys, before you can even speak to somebody, has a recording saying we'll have  limited quantities on Sunday.  Yeah.  And, uh...  Well, are they not out yet?  No, they are out.  Well, is he still here?  What?  Is he here?  He wasn't until like night.  Why don't we see where he is, Trev?  Well, I'm sure he'll be back by 10.  We can get a little wrap-up.  Oh, well, you think he'll be back by 10?  I don't.  If he left already, if he just left, he's right there.  All right, let's bring him in.  Pull him in. 
[02:46:00]  Pull him in.  Let's get an update on Anthony's Xbox One.  Because at this point...  Paying the...  Hold on, just for the people, because they're just tuning in.  Anthony gave the intern $600 to try to find you an Xbox One.  There's your update.  And now we're going to find...  Oh, boy.  I'm trying to find one cheap.  He can keep the change.  Let me tell you, or ask you...  How's it going?  What?  Give me a synopsis of what you've done.  Yeah.  After you left with the task at hand, how did it go down?  Well, I first looked on GameStop, then I went...  I first looked on GameStop. 
[02:46:30]  Yes.  GameStop.  Act, act, act, act.  You could do cartoons, dude, for real.  Yeah, yeah.  Turn that negative into a major fucking positive.  A cartoon?  You could be a snail or something, I'm telling you, easily.  So GameStop.  Okay, GameStop, Best Buy, Target.  And then I checked Craigslist, Jamaica Station.  I hear helium.  Yeah, yeah, there is a helium thing.  Has anyone told you you've got a voice thing going on?  They said I have a unique voice. 
[02:47:00]  Do black people say you balloon-sounding motherfucker?  Red rum, red rum, red rum.  And then I checked around with some of his friends.  And nothing has panned out?  Nothing that I can get to within an hour.  Well, now it's 20 minutes.  Where are the ones you could get to, but not in an hour?  Well, I didn't check further than that.  Oh, why would you?  Because he said he needed to be here by 10.  That is true.  And his own words are coming back to haunt him.  Well. 
[02:47:30]  I did get over that voice.  It's amazing.  Thank you.  Red rum, red rum.  Did you do radio?  Red rum.  College radio?  I did, yes.  Red rum.  Red rum.  That's hilarious.  Say red rum.  Red rum.  Red rum.  Red rum.  He tried to, you know.  Red rum.  He tried to butch it up a little there.  All right.  Well, I guess it ain't going to happen.  Yep.  I'll, uh, I'll take back my cash, my friend. 
[02:48:00]  Well, you did say throws in the towel 20 minutes before the deadline.  Well, that's, it's New York City.  It's not an Xbox One to be found.  All your money.  What happened?  You lose it?  Nope.  Give him back those five bills.  Here's your money.  Five.  You better have six.  Oh, fucking.  Thank you.  Thanks for nothing.  How could you quit 20 minutes before the deadline?  You wouldn't have? 
[02:48:30]  No way.  No, just to make it look like you were trying right to the last moment, right?  Yeah, you just go, oh, wait, I just had an idea, and you leave the studio, and you come  back 20 minutes later.  You never.  It's more of that slacker mentality that's all around us these days.  Do the minimum amount.  It's like, I'm not.  I'm serious.  I know.  Even if you knew in your head, there's no way I could get this done, you, like, make  it look really good.  And go, I would love to come in and give you guys an update, but I'm still working this.  I'm still working on a few last-minute angles.  Or like, hey, look, I just found something, so I'm going to be here until 10.30. 
[02:49:00]  Oh.  Should I go for it?  No.  I'd say no.  But you got to say no.  You can't.  Well, you probably won't want that.  Yeah.  That would be a gamble.  I don't think he likes people talking about his voice.  Wow.  You could tell that, couldn't you?  Oh, yeah.  He really wasn't going for it.  Well, it's okay, yeah.  He doesn't seem fun.  He doesn't like being the punchline.  And I predict, like, time will go by, and his name will come up somewhere, and I'll  be like, who?  What?  And you'll be like, remember that intern that couldn't get you the Xbox One?  And I'll be like, I have no recollection of this at all whatsoever. 
[02:49:30]  The voice, the guy with the voice, you'll go, oh, yeah, Helium Boy.  No, I don't remember.  Yeah.  And that will be Tuesday.  And then you'll say, remember you said you wouldn't remember?  And I go, I don't remember that.  You forget the interns?  Yeah.  I have no fucking use for them.  That's not funny.  I saw Jackie in Rochester.  You did?  Oh, okay.  She's been hired, and she's kicking ass for Brother Weez.  Oh, good for her.  She's doing a lot of shit for Brother Weez's radio show.  How's her ass look? 
[02:50:00]  Speaking of ass.  Still looking good?  I asked her about her mom, actually.  My mom's ass?  Yeah, her mom's ass was all right.  It's true.  Yeah, she's doing great.  She says hi.  Yeah.  School bans.  The latest here is Christmas trees, of course.  Good.  But this school's going even further.  School bans, Christmas trees, and who wants to guess what else?  Red and green.  Menorah.  You're not a fucking star, you son of a bitch.  No, I didn't.  Menorah. 
[02:50:30]  The colors red and green have also been.  I was kidding.  Oh, they are.  I read the story.  They're banning the colors red and green on top of banning Christmas trees.  Why is that?  Because people are losing their fucking minds.  That's why.  Because it goes to our point that we have said so much that people are sick of hearing it,  that that's why you've got to fight this shit at every step, because they never stop and they continue.  What's wrong with fucking shit?  It goes with Christmas trees and like, okay, we got that done.  What else can we ban?  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:51:00]  That's why you've got to fight this shit, even if you, for the most part, don't agree with it.  Oh, my God.  An elementary school in Frisco, Texas, is believed to be the first in the state to violate the Merry Christmas law after they banned Christmas trees and the colors red and green from an upcoming winter party.  It's called the Winter Party now.  The Winter Party?  Boys and girls who attend the Blah Blah Elementary School Winter Party will not be able to make any reference to Christmas.  They're not even allowed to make references to Christmas.  Cowards. 
[02:51:30]  Or any other religious holiday.  Christmas trees are also banned, along with the colors red and green.  So you cannot show up at the winter party dressed in red and green.  That's what all the people who want, all these parents that don't call in and complain and stand up, this is what you get.  This is what you get.  But in my dumb, stupid world, we don't see Christmas, for the most part, as a religious holiday anymore.  But talk about banning the burka and watch how fast people freak out. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, yeah.  They have religious freedom to do it.  Yeah.  Christmas is one of those things.  You could just shit all over it.  The rules were sent to parents in an email from the school's PTA.  And it was first reported, maybe they got this news story there, Sam, by MyFoxDFW.com.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  What?  No kidding.  Those guys.  Jesus.  Good for them.  Ironically, the school's located in the District of State Rep. Pat Fallon. 
[02:52:30]  The author of a bill signed into law in June that codifies...  I don't know that word.  How do you spell it?  C-O-D-I-F-I-E-S.  Codifies.  The fact that students and staff are permitted to discuss winter holidays as they please.  It codifies.  Makes things into fish?  Yes.  Yeah, I think so.  Cod, I believe.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  It's called the Merry Christmas Bill.  Clearly, that didn't solve the issue, he said.  The battle rages on.  It's distressing.  Yeah.  The school district released a statement. 
[02:53:00]  The school was unaware of this.  I guess the Merry Christmas Bill.  Yeah.  And it was not an official PTA correspondence either.  There have never been any limitations on what students wear, what they bring to share with their classmates on party days,  what greetings people exchange with each other.  So I guess they're backtracking a little bit.  But did they, if they didn't say that in official communication, who sent that out?  It was, it was, I bet you it was some kind of official communication, but now they look like idiots. 
[02:53:30]  Idiots, right.  And now they're trying to figure out a way out of it.  Maybe it wasn't on the proper letterhead, so they said, oh, thank God you didn't use the proper letterhead, so this isn't official.  Oh, my God.  Watch the bullet.  But Fallon said, contrary to the school district statement, the ban remains in place.  He also said he spoke to the superintendent and learned that the school district was letting principals set their own policies regarding holiday celebrations.  Fallon said the ban of Christmas trees and traditional holiday colors remains in place and calls it unnecessary, inappropriate, and quite frankly, draconian in nature. 
[02:54:00]  Let's see.  She, the principal, said they didn't want to offend any families.  And since each family donates money, they feel this is the best policy.  Well, you know, they know best.  Huh?  They know best.  I don't know what's going on at my kid's school as far as that goes.  I gotta ask.  I'm gonna ask today.  Yeah, and you should call and complain. 
[02:54:30]  I don't really see any Christmassy things in his classroom.  No?  It's kind of still early, right?  Not really.  That shit should be up by now.  Should be.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's well within time.  What is it?  Thanksgiving wasn't even acknowledged.  So, so far, my skin, my skin, my kid's school, Hollywood was not acknowledged.  They weren't allowed to wear costumes.  Oh, God.  Thanksgiving absolutely was not acknowledged.  But I think they got together for like a meal.  Thanksgiving is a fucking American holiday.  I can almost understand religious holidays, but this is an American, like a national about America. 
[02:55:00]  How could you not honor Thanksgiving?  No, because it's...  When you're running around like a lunatic at a mall, are you thinking about the baby Jesus?  Of course not.  I always am, but that's me.  It's so more than a religious holiday at this point.  Well, Thanksgiving is very offensive to people because, you know, it harkens back to the days of the poor Native Americans.  I feel sorry for these kids today.  It's like, how do you go to school and they don't acknowledge any of this stuff?  It kind of made it fun in school, right? 
[02:55:30]  Oh, yeah.  The whole month of December, I didn't even think we had Christmas trees in our classrooms back in the day.  Right?  We have to look forward to it.  I believe we did.  It's been so many years, but I think we had Christmas trees and then we had our own, you know, decorations that we made in the art portion of school.  And we put it on our classroom tree.  And that was high school.  Yeah.  You make Santa and then take the cotton and glue it on for the big beard and stuff.  And not only did we do that stuff, we booed Jews when they walked by.  Yes. 
[02:56:00]  Well, you have to.  They'd walk by and we would just go, boo!  We'd laugh at them.  Right.  What is this?  From SiriusXM, this is an official.  Is this an official communique?  Well, it's what went out on the corporate email.  All right.  Let's read this.  I'm going to read this cold.  I don't even know why this is up there.  You are invited to a year-end gathering on Thursday, December 12th from 5 to 7 p.m. in the 36th floor lobby, which is looking terrific with that stone. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, yeah.  It looks really amazing.  On an online app still sucks a dick, but let me tell you, man, the stone work is just amazing.  Come and have a bite, share a toast with your colleagues, and watch as our own Scott Greenstein squares off against DJ Sway in the fishbowl for an epic match of ping-pong.  What?  This is a lie.  Do you know what?  I heard something happen in Hong Kong once concerning the game of ping-pong. 
[02:57:00]  It was.  I hear tell.  Oh, my God.  Greenstein loves attention.  I'll be honest.  I only want to go to that if they're playing a game I saw at the end of The Deer Hunter.  Exactly.  I think the participation from this channel is going to be a bit light.  Minimal.  You sense that?  A bit light.  A little minimal.  Let's bring penthouse pets.  Who will be the needy ones that go to this?  I'm going to put Roland on that list.  Roland loves a good lobby party. 
[02:57:30]  I'm going to put E-Rock on that list.  E-Rock.  And I swear to you, sorry, but I think maybe a Sam Roberts would be still around.  But besides that, there's no one else going.  I think Sam would be there.  Travis, I know you're not going.  Do a little recon.  Huh?  So he could come in and needle people that were there and talk about how much they ate and drank.  You would go, right, Sam?  Yeah, but I would go the way Ant watches Criss Angel.  Right.  With a heart on her.  You know who I know probably already has it on his calendar? 
[02:58:00]  Danny.  Yep.  Oh, Danny is definitely going.  Oh, my.  God.  And where's the prep sheet I had for a fucking hour ago?  What prep sheet?  Those pictures I was supposed to see.  Oh.  I think Mars will go.  No, I never...  Hell no.  What's wrong with you?  No, Mars gets the fuck out of here.  Mars will cut him, motherfucker.  Mars won't even fix the phone.  It's not going to be a fucking company.  Corporate fucking bullshit.  They'll have Mars fix the ping pong table because there's only three legs.  I can't wait to see the big square off. 
[02:58:30]  Who's going to win?  It's going to be crazy.  I think everyone will gather around.  I'd like to fill that ping pong with plutonium.  I'd love to.  I wish we could throw ping pong balls at Greenstein's asshole.  Do the old cherry fucking darts gig.  Anyway, we can lock the door and fill that up with water.  Let's just watch him drown.  Just do what you meant to do.  Oh, we got it.  That's going to be an epic party.  Yeah.  When is it now?  It's Thursday the 12th. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, god damn it.  I'm going to be in LA.  I'm going to miss the big match.  Shit.  Ladies and gentlemen, Dennis Falcone.  Oh, Denny.  Denny's got...  You all right with this, Jimmy?  Gentlemen, how are you?  Hi.  It's got his Don Corleone and Godfather 2 mustache.  Why are you going with the mustache?  I just wanted to try it.  That's what people do when they accidentally kill a hooker or a child.  They change their look.  Quickly.  Yeah.  And hope for the best.  Just give it a shot. 
[02:59:30]  Got nothing to lose.  Obviously, all the fucking rugs in his van are brand new.  Yeah.  You're going almost tight with it, though.  What do you mean tight?  You know tight.  Oh, short.  Yeah, it's a bit tight.  Yeah.  Almost like a state trooper thing.  Yeah.  Like a nice and short.  I say you go handlebars.  Nah.  Right now, it's what they call a pedo mustache.  Yeah, exactly.  It always will be.  As long as it's attached to him.  Dennis Falcone, of course, you're a company man.  Are you very excited about the epic ping pong match that's going down with Scott Greenstein 
[03:00:00]  and DJ Sway?  There's going to be a lot of food and free beer.  So I'll be there.  Free beer?  It's two hours.  Yeah, yeah.  The party just starts getting going and then that's it.  Yeah, they let the caddies into the pool in Caddyshack.  That's what they're doing here in the lobby.  It's a lot of food.  It's a nice time.  I'll be here.  I'm certainly not the only one that remembers the giant, over-the-top radio station Christmas  parties that used to go down.  Those used to be a lot of fun.  Holy fuck, it was all night and, you know, it was bad. 
[03:00:30]  Too many jobs are probably lost, though.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying, my bad.  Someone was getting fucked.  Right.  Usually on a Thursday night it was pretty good because then you only had to drag it on a  Friday.  Oh, yeah?  Well, then it led to the famous tape by Frankie Blue.  Frankie Blue.  Frankie Blue.  Who wanted to fuck one of the listeners.  That was crazy.  Frankie Blue.  Called him the night jock.  Why would he say that?  I don't know.  Well, no, he was so wasted that he fired the wasted other jock and did her shift, I guess.  I don't think radio stations have parties.  We used to trade them out. 
[03:01:00]  That's what I'm saying.  We haven't had a radio station Christmas party in, I don't know, fucking, I think it was when  we were at NW.  And a lot of companies have cut that.  Christmas was a different animal back then.  You would get a party and you would get a bonus.  Do you remember getting a Christmas bonus?  They canned you a fucking envelope with a check in it.  Here you go.  Thank you.  1993, I got a honey-baked ham for a Christmas bonus at a radio station.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I thought it was nice.  Why don't you guys throw a show Christmas party? 
[03:01:30]  You're in the position where you can be throwing the party now.  You know what?  You're right, and I will.  It's tomorrow at E-Rock's house.  Really?  Yeah!  No.  Everyone's welcome.  Dude, you should throw one at your house tomorrow and watch how E-Rock has fucking  an empty home.  Oh, no.  Let's compete with E-Rock's party.  Bash it, ants.  Chicks.  Yes.  He's going to be ass-eating, cunt-licking.  Oh, poor E-Rock. 
[03:02:00]  Oh, he'd just be sitting there all alone with his dumb fucking He-Man toys.  Oh, playing with his toys, crying.  Yeah.  Being happy he doesn't have to share all those fucking snacks.  Are you going to be at the party, Sam?  I just might.  Why should one go to a party like this, Daddy?  Why not?  Educate us, because we're not accompanying men like you.  I don't know if you know that.  So don't go.  No, I've noticed that.  You have noticed that we're not.  You guys are out the office before the 10 o'clock ID hits.  He has cankles.  What?  He does. 
[03:02:30]  I don't like your cankles.  You got big, thick ankles there, Dennis?  No, I was going to wear...  Put them up on the console.  I was going to wear chinos, so I wore tan socks.  Chinos.  And then, uh...  I got a little water weight gain.  I just wore...  Hopefully, it's a Dino.  Damn, you got some thick-ass ankles.  Yeah.  Big, giant...  What happened?  I got hit by a car when I was a little boy.  Oh, jeez.  Did you really?  Both legs.  Stop kidding.  What happened?  You got hit by a car when you were a little boy?  You got to be honest.  I'm out.  That's great.  I'm out.  You said, what happened to your ankles?  I'm out.  That's exactly what happened.  You got hit by a car.  You broke both your legs.  Yeah.  Oh, that's great.  How did that happen?  What were you doing?  I was walking home from school on Pearl Harbor Day, which is tomorrow. 
[03:03:00]  It's anniversary.  And I stopped to put my ski cap on.  I'm not kidding you.  A car, out of control, I guess, hit water or ice or something, and hit me and knocked  me 30 feet in the air into a little creek.  I kid you not.  How old were you?  The car came very close to saving this segment.  Eighth grade.  Oh, you weren't a kid.  You were in eighth grade.  Yeah.  And it snapped.  What bones did it snap?  Everything.  Leg bones.  Yeah, well...  Fibia, tibia.  Oh, it got your...  Ankles. 
[03:03:30]  Tibia and fibula.  Yeah.  So, wait, both your legs were broken.  Yeah, yeah.  And that way, your ankles are a little plumb.  Yep.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, but you can't...  I mean, as sad as it might be, you can't say it's not funny to think about tiny little  Denny getting flown through the air.  Fucking hilarious, the picture happening now.  Oh, Jesus.  And you ended up in a creek?  Yeah.  Underwater or anything?  It was just right through the water, yeah.  How about a little lawsuit?  It was ice.  How'd that work out for you?  Not too well.  Why?  Well, because the guys, it was a long time ago. 
[03:04:00]  It was like, you lent your car to Ope and said, look, Opey, whatever you're doing, I'll  let your girlfriend drive this car.  And you said, okay, because she only had a permit.  She drove the car, she had the accident, and it was like, he sued me, I sued me, I sued  So the insurance company said, well, nobody sued me, but the guy sued me.  The other guy...  You scratched my bumper.  So our lawyer said, you know, if you got hit by an oil truck, we would really have something.  I said, if I got hit by an oil truck, I wouldn't be here.  That's what he meant.  I got hit by a Ford Falcon, you know?  It was like...  Oh, Denny Falcone hit by a falcon. 
[03:04:30]  How perfect.  Wow, that is fucked up, huh?  I wish her name was Denny Traney.  But I used to have tutors.  I used to have tutors come to the house to do the assignments.  Well, it doesn't matter.  You got a front and a back door.  I get it.  I had tutors in my house.  My mom used to be cooking, and all of a sudden the tutors would go, what are you making?  She goes, peppers and sausage, you know?  She'd give them a dish of food.  I wouldn't have to worry about it.  I'd go into the other room, watch TV, listen to the radio, right down the...  What's he talking about?  I don't know.  I'd tap down. 
[03:05:00]  What happened?  We were just having a good time here.  How long were you not able to walk?  About six months.  I was in a wheelchair.  You were in a wheelchair for six months?  Well, I had casts up to, you know, both legs.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's great.  Your balls must have stunk.  Your balls stink, dude?  I don't know.  How did you take a piss?  What's that?  How did you take a piss and a shit?  They have those things that they give you in the hospital.  Like a bedpan?  You had a shit in a bedpan?  Nice.  I need a bedpan.  At home?  Yeah.  How long were you in the hospital?  Three weeks. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, wow.  Jesus.  What time of year was it?  It's obviously the winter.  Was it before the holidays?  Pearl Harbor Day.  I'm sorry.  The anniversary is like tomorrow.  You spent Christmas in the hospital?  Came home the day before.  Oh, Christmas Eve.  Yeah.  It's a little Christmas miracle that you made at home.  Aw, Danny spent Christmas in a wheelchair.  It's a funny Christmas song.  What street was it again?  It was Valley Stream.  No, Pearl Street?  What did you say?  No, Pearl Harbor Day.  Oh, what was the street?  Mill Road.  Oh, all right.  I was going to say that. 
[03:06:00]  Well, lyrical.  Miracle on Mill Road.  We could change it.  We could change it.  Danny got hit by a fowl.  Great story.  Just a story.  But yes, I am going to the Christmas party.  Do you still feel it when it rains?  Yes, I do.  Yes.  Oh, yeah?  Yes, I do.  That's so funny.  That's why I like the heat in the summertime.  I understand.  Your ankles don't hurt.  I walk around like Walter Brennan in the winter.  I surround your chubby ankles.  Are you like, do you have this underlying post-traumatic stress thing about cars?  I drive when I'm in the car.  No.  Well, we go anywhere I drive. 
[03:06:30]  What about walking, though?  What's that?  What about walking, though?  Well, I don't mind walking.  When you cross the street, you're not like extra paranoid about getting hit by a car?  Well, a couple of years ago, I was walking to work, and I slipped on the ice and broke  my arm in the winter, too.  Jesus Christ, why don't you move to fucking Hawaii?  It's like that slush that goes, you know, on the city side.  I know what ice is.  I bet you hate Jackie Gleason hitting the whole rink.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't decide which of those two things I would love to see more.  I bet you hate walking songs at this point. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  I just hate winter.  Yeah, huh?  So you slipped and broke your arm.  Yeah.  Then he couldn't get up because his arm was broken.  No, I got up.  I went to work.  Was it a broken arm?  I went to work.  I put my arm in, like, my scarf.  No way.  I'm not kidding you.  I did my work.  I put together the show that I had to put together.  Then I went home, and I went to the doctor's.  Oh.  And this kid stops at 940.  Not going to find you an Xbox.  Not going to find me an Xbox One.  That's true.  Just had to do what I had to do.  Back in the day.  You got to do what you had to do.  That guy might be good with us in the morning show if we ever do a show together, Sam and I. 
[03:07:30]  You and me?  Yeah.  The great voices we have here.  I didn't know that was on the table.  Why don't we go home?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  We're out of time.  Well, hopefully you guys come to the party.  We'll have a cocktail.  Welcome to the party, Victor.  One last call from Mr. Levy.  He's got an Xbox for you, I think.  I am.  Bob Levy.  Yes, I made a few calls.  You're not going to be able to get one at the store, but I talked to a friend of mine,  and he's going to make a few calls, so you might be able to get one on the arm for you.  On the arm.  I like that. 
[03:08:00]  That's police talk.  Police talk.  Yes.  That means he's stolen one.  Yeah, exactly.  I think I'm...  That's not stolen.  It's just misplaced.  Oh, okay.  Fell off the back of a truck.  He found it.  Yeah, I think I'll just wait.  Thank you.  I mean, you don't want one on the arm.  I don't think I want one on the arm.  Are you sure?  Why not?  Yeah.  You were taking one on the ass.  He's a joke.  You can have what's-his-name walking across the street so you can get a fucking car again.  Yeah, Denny. 
[03:08:30]  Denny, go pick this up for us.  Who the fuck stops in the middle of the street to put a fucking hat on?  No, no, I was on the sidewalk.  Yeah, that's pretty stupid.  Were you there?  I was on the sidewalk.  The car jumped the sidewalk.  I was on the sidewalk to put my hat on.  Nice reflexes.  And the guy's girlfriend was driving?  Yeah.  Was she cute?  I don't know.  I didn't see her.  How big was her clit?  Maybe they changed drivers after the accident.  The car turned upside down.  It did.  Wow.  It flipped over.  They walked away.  Wow, those are some fucking heavy legs.  They walked away.  Oh, you little broken legs.  Little broken Denny legs.  Did they get you out of the creek? 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  They did.  No, they didn't.  An off-duty cop was going to work.  What were they doing?  They got out of the car.  Hmm.  They didn't care where little Denny was?  No.  Where's the spindly-legged little mustache boy?  We just ran over.  How'd he get out of the creek?  An off-duty policeman.  He was going to work.  Right.  And I guess he saw the accident.  He dragged me out.  Apparently not a radio fan.  Damn.  A lot of love in the room today.  That's fucked up right there. 
[03:09:30]  Right.  People are picking up on the fact that Sirius XM is not a Christmas party.  It's the year-end gathering.  Yeah.  Oh, it's great.  The year-end gathering.  Oh, right.  Because they don't allow the word Christmas because it's very racist.  But are we still celebrating Christmas even though it's the year-end gathering?  Of course it is.  Everyone in the room knows what it's supposed to be called.  That's why that stuff is stupid, too.  Because wouldn't you just have a winter party like after Christmas and then everyone...  February.  It's perfectly clear that it's just a party in winter?  Yeah, we have the February winter party.  Right. 
[03:10:00]  There you go.  Then you can't associate it at all with Christmas.  I did that once for a Jehovah's Witness group in January.  I DJed their winter party or something.  Really?  And they just said don't make any reference to anything.  The Christmas time party, the winter party, make-believe it has nothing to do with Christmas  is so stupid.  It is.  Maybe that's why you're not going to go because you're standing up to those kind of beliefs.  I just don't like the people that are in here.  Bob, where are you going to be this weekend?  Anything?  I go to BobLevy.com. 
[03:10:30]  I'm doing the Parks Casino next Wednesday.  Uncle Vinny's at the end of the month.  Okay.  And I wanted to know if that ping-pong tournament thing that they're having, is that going to  be on pay-per-view for the fans to watch?  Hopefully.  Dare to dream.  Dare to dream.  Probably do better than Impact Wrestling.  I hope so.  Why don't you guys have a fucking party?  Let's throw a fucking big party.  You got one tomorrow.  Instead of a fucking kiss-ass festival.  Tomorrow in Jersey.  I'm at a big party. 
[03:11:00]  Big Christmas party over at E-Rock's house.  That's right.  You're invited.  Tomorrow?  Yeah.  I'm busy.  Christ.  All right.  I'm going home.  Jimmy's continuing.  Bye, Bobby.  Good talking to you, brother.  When is Jack Osborne coming in?  10-20, I think.  He's doing Good Morning Malik or something and then coming right after.  Okay.  All right.  I want Tim Sabian to know that we had no idea Jack Osborne was coming in.  He's booked for the after show.  And he was officially booked for the after show.  It was a very late booking and he would have come in Opie and Anthony, but he was doing TV?  Well, we couldn't figure out the time.  Yeah. 
[03:11:30]  All right.  Go to Dennis Calcone.  Thank you.  Have a good day, guys.  I'm happy your little legs are okay.  Your little dumb little legs.  Let me stumble back to my desk.  This is After Opie and Anthony Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yes.  As we wait for Jack Osborne to join us in a few minutes.  This is After Opie and Anthony Live.  This is your theme song?  Yeah.  What do you think?  What is it?  It's a Kanye West song. 
[03:12:00]  It's called Black Skinheads.  It sounds like Gary Glitter.  No, it's not Gary.  This is fucking the same as Gary Glitter.  It's not Gary Glitter.  Ba-na-na-na-hey.  No, it's just got a big bass drum in it.  Ba-na-na-na-hey.  No.  It's got a big bass drum in it, but that's the only similarity.  It's exactly the same thing.  It's not a pedophile song.  It's not a shitty Gary...  Ba-na-na-na-na-hey.  Well, when you barrel over it, it's kind of hard to...  I do love a good barreling. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, my gosh.  Jim is sticking around, obviously, for the Jack Osborne interview.  Yeah, and he was doing a, I guess, TV or something.  Couldn't come earlier.  Right.  Otherwise, he would have done O&A like he did last time for the documentary.  I never saw the documentary.  It was great.  It was good.  I loved it, yeah.  And not just because it's Ozzy.  Well, maybe just because it's Ozzy, but I mean, it was well done.  It was well put together, and there was interviews and stuff that I'd never seen.  But are you the type of fan that you'll like it just because it's Ozzy?  Yes, I am.  So you're not, like, sitting there criticizing it because you need it to be a certain level.  I want it. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, I expect it to be interesting.  Because to me, anything they say about him will be interesting.  But seeing the band members interviewed and the family and Jack talk to the kids, like  himself, of course, and his sisters, and also Ozzy's kids from his first marriage, and  they talked about, like, hey, we wish he was here more, we wish he was a better dad,  and, you know, more present, or...  I mean, it was heavy.  They said that.  Oh, yeah.  And I was...  I should ask Jack about that.  Write it down so you don't forget.  I have to, dude.  Uh, hold on, you're done watching.  Ask about Ozzy. 
[03:13:30]  Yes, Ozzy.  I'll just put Ozzy in period so I know if I'm in a rush.  Um, yeah, and I was wondering if it was uncomfortable for Ozzy to watch.  I think we asked Ozzy when he was in.  But how did that...  I don't think anything's uncomfortable for him at this point.  With the kids, though, it's always weird with people's kids.  Your kids are on camera saying they wish you were around more.  Yeah, they were saying, uh, Sharon and I think Ozzy have both recently kind of said that they did, kind of wish they didn't do the reality show.  Like, they like how much fame and money it brought them and where it's taken their family in terms of career. 
[03:14:00]  But in terms of exposure and all that stuff, they kind of regret the fact that their kids' awkward stages and obnoxious periods in their lives were publicized for everybody.  But it did set the path of Jack's and Kelly's life.  Absolutely.  They're tremendously successful now because they were recognizable figures.  Like, you kind of knew who they were.  And you either liked them or didn't like them, but you knew them.  So then when you saw them on TV, you weren't like, who the fuck is this?  You're like, oh, okay, that's Kelly from the show or Jack from the show. 
[03:14:30]  They're probably the most...  Some of the more successful, you know, rock star kids.  Yes.  Like, Jack is...  They've all...  They've gotten their shit together.  Kelly is killing it on E!  She's on every red carpet show.  She's on all the fashion police show.  And Jack, he's always got some shit going on.  He's just...  He made it through the whole season of Dancing with the Stars.  Yeah, which is pretty amazing.  I mean, the guy has fucking MS.  Yeah.  And he's dancing.  I mean, I have sleep apnea and I cry that I can't get through 20 minutes of cardio.  So tired!  I know, I know.  I'm fucking boring myself if it's any consolation. 
[03:15:00]  Let me go to the phones while we wait for Jack Osborne.  Nick in Niagara Falls.  What's going on, guys?  Hi, Nick.  Listen, I got a question.  A couple questions.  If you guys can settle a bet for me.  Sure.  Did Opie and Anthony used to do a bit where you call in, you tell a joke, and if the joke  is bombed, they give out your phone number down the air?  No, that's illegal.  I mean, they never would have been able to do that.  Never?  Not to my knowledge.  I don't think so.  I don't believe so.  I mean, they could have done it early on, but I don't think so. 
[03:15:30]  And Kathleen put your goddamn clothes back on.  Was that Opie and Anthony?  Yes, that was Paul Mercurio.  Yes, you guys got to replay that bit.  If you guys still have it, it's really old, but it's fucking hilarious.  I don't know if we're allowed to play certain bits from any W. That's the problem.  Right.  All right.  Thanks, Nick.  Okay.  All right.  Jason in Rochester.  How's it going, buddy?  Hey.  I really like the wrestling opening bit, just because I don't watch wrestling anymore.  Thank God.  I always get scared when we do wrestling bits that everybody is at home mad at me, even 
[03:16:00]  though Jim brought this one up.  I did, yeah.  But I was just wondering, like, what you guys think was the prime time for wrestling, because  I think it was the Attitude Era right after that ended, I quit watching.  But, like, just the beginning when, like, In Your House pay-per-views started and Undertaker  was coming up from the ring, I still look back and watch, like, the old Stone Cold this  and just laugh my ass off because I'm older now.  I mean, yeah, the best time for wrestling when it was actually cool and everything was  definitely the late 90s, when everybody was watching and they were making ridiculous 
[03:16:30]  money and they were doing cool shit.  They were cursing and breaking things and showing some tit and, you know, it was cool.  That was probably, that was probably...  Yeah, I think I was out by that time, so I can't even comment.  Jim preferred the mid to late 70s going into the early 80s, mainly because of Bob Backlund's  knee walk.  That's a great move.  Do you love the knee walk?  The knee walk?  Yeah.  No, I don't love...  Why would I love the knee walk?  It's an amazing wrestling move. 
[03:17:00]  But he doesn't even, it doesn't do anything to the opponent.  Yeah, it's just, ah, it's him prowling in the knee walk.  Bob Backlund used to walk around the ring and drop to his knees as he walked.  It was like doing, um, what do they call it, like the forward, not squats, but, uh...  Lunges.  Lunges, yeah.  Yeah.  I guess it was just a feat of his strength.  Yeah, he could lunge all over that ring.  He's a strong motherfucker.  Of course he is.  He still is now.  I met him, uh, I took a photo with him at like a WWE show and he put me in a move and  you could just tell, he could have broken my neck at any moment.  Do wrestling fans like Bob Backlund? 
[03:17:30]  Now?  Yeah.  They don't know who he is.  Really?  I mean, look, he's still got it when I, uh, we, he was in, he got inducted into the  Hall of Fame, uh, last year or this year, I guess in March and he was talking in front  of a sold out Madison Square Garden and it was just talking and everybody was bored being  there because they had just brought out, uh, Donald Trump and everybody booed Donald  Trump.  Why?  Anybody who's not a wrestler was getting booed.  I wouldn't get booed. 
[03:18:00]  You don't think so?  No.  You get some good wrestling jokes that you would dish out on the crowd.  They'd love me.  And Maria Menounos.  She came out right before and got booed, but, uh, Jack Osborne's out here.  Enough of this nonsense.  Come on in.  Come on in, Jack.  I think it's important stuff.  What, the wrestling stuff?  It is.  It's important to educate.  How's it going, man?  Sit down.  Okay.  Get comfortable, Jack.  You know Jim, of course.  Yeah, of course.  I'm Sam.  We're, we're live now.  We're just, we've already started and we'd like you to join us.  How's it going, man? 
[03:18:30]  Good.  Your hair looks good.  Thank you.  You look hot now.  Thanks, man.  Look at you guys just flirting with each other right off the bat.  What a beautiful thing.  I feel like I'm third wheeling this day.  Jack and I have an announcement.  So what's up, man?  How's it going?  Oh, it's, it's going.  Yeah?  I'm hanging in there.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Are you worn out after the Dancing with the Stars schedule?  Yes and no.  It's one of those things where, you know, I finished right on Thanksgiving and had a couple  days off and then came out here.  So I haven't really had too much time to, you know, take the dance shoes off. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah.  Physically, that show is ridiculously demanding, right?  Yes.  But I will say this.  If anyone in this room ever has the opportunity to do it, totally do it.  Would you do it, Jim?  I would.  They wouldn't ask me.  Like, if they ever get to the Jim Norton Dancing with the Stars, the show is ready  to go off the air.  It's never gotten that bad for them.  Right.  But the, uh, how many hours a day do you have to rehearse for that?  About six hours a day.  Oh.  That's a lot.  Five days a week?  Seven days a week.  I didn't have a day off for 14 weeks in a row.  Could you dance before that?  Hell no. 
[03:19:30]  No.  Absolutely.  I still can't dance.  Do you?  I don't.  What do you, so what are you doing basically?  You're just kind of, you're, if you're not, you're just kind of going over them almost  like a twister thing where you, we've done these moves so many times it becomes  repetition.  That, that's all it is.  It's muscle memory.  Like you, you train so hard and you do the dance so many times.  Like it's weird.  Cause everyone's like, well, what do you think about when you, when you actually would go  out performance?  Like, actually, I don't know.  I just, you just kind of.  Yeah.  Just do.  So were you planning on, did you want to go to the end or were you thinking I'd go on 
[03:20:00]  for a couple of weeks?  I'll get my charity stuff out there and that'll be that.  Yeah.  That was it.  It was like, uh, go out.  Um, we always, you know, Cheryl and I joked that I'm most likely would be going by week  five.  Uh huh.  And if week seven rolled by, like that would be the week I would go.  Yeah.  Um, so lo and behold, how many weeks was it that you actually made it?  11.  I made it to the, to the final three.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  It just came in third, which is amazing.  Cause you remember when Jerry Springer was on a couple of seasons ago and like we as a  show started trying to get our audience to vote for him every week. 
[03:20:30]  And he called our show and said, please stop having the audience vote for me.  I can't do this every week.  He was done.  Yeah.  So what do you do?  You just win money for the, uh, the MS charity?  No, that was, I kind of, I wanted to use it as a kind of platform to kind of start raising  awareness about MS and just coincidentally, I had to, I had this project in the works  before doing the show and I put it on hold, but launching this awareness campaign called  you don't know Jack about MS.  And it's kind of, um, you know, it's, uh, just to kind of bring to light the kind of 
[03:21:00]  what MS is really.  Um, and how it affects people and me in particular, and it's just a kind of an information, uh,  campaign.  Did it, did it fuck with your work schedule at all?  Or your, cause I'm, I was amazed that you got MS and you're doing this rigorous dance  schedule.  Yeah.  Um, it, what the MS or the dancing?  You hadn't, having MS, I mean, it's obviously a very physical illness.  I mean, did it affect you at all where you do a days you couldn't do anything? 
[03:21:30]  Um, there were no, I mean, there was a couple of days where I was, I was hurting a bit.  Um, and I just kind of, I had to take it kind of easy, but we were so far into the show at  that point, that was like a week, week nine or 10.  And it was like, well, I can't, I can't, I can't bow out now.  So I got to kind of work through this.  And so, you know, we took it easy and, you know, a couple of days went by and I was, I  got better and we just, what is it, what is exactly does it do to you?  So MS is a, um, autoimmune disease that kind of your body attacks its own nerves and 
[03:22:00]  essentially tries to strip down your nerve endings and, and peels away the, um, protective  layer.  It's just pain.  It, it can't, it can be pain.  It can be numbness.  It can be tingling.  It can be electric sensation.  It can be lost vision.  Um, some people have problems with taste.  I mean, it's anything and everything to do with nerves.  So how did you find out that you had it?  Um, I went blind in my right eye.  Uh, that's what prompted me to go to the doctor. 
[03:22:30]  Uh, but before that, totally blind or you were just like seeing blurry or it was gone.  I had like 90% of my central vision was gone.  It was like black.  And that's just like that.  I woke up and there was a little, I was actually, I went to, I always joke that, um, the movie  Avengers sent me blind because I, I went to see Avengers and then on the way home, stopped  at a gas station.  And as I was talking to the clerk, this like black dot just appeared in my vision, like  very small.  And then I thought it was like a migraine cause I've had like that before. 
[03:23:00]  And then the next morning I woke up and the dot got bigger.  And then over the next two days, it was just like, Jesus.  So if you hadn't gone to the doctor, would you have lost your vision or that would have  settled on its own anyway?  Um, they, they usually, when you have flare ups, you know, the common, um, you know,  probably on procedure, the doctors will do it.  They put you on steroids to help reduce the inflammation of that nerve.  And so I went on steroids, you know, three days after I'd kind of had this problem in  my eye.  And they said that if I wouldn't have, it probably would have had a, they call them 
[03:23:30]  dark spots.  Just exactly that.  Just a dark spot on my vision.  But, uh, but prior to that, the problem in my eye, my legs went numb for three months.  For three months?  Yeah.  About a little over a year and a half earlier.  But aren't there so many other things that that can be?  MS is not the first choice.  Is it sciatica?  That's why I didn't go to the doctor.  I was like, oh, I, I tweaked it cause I was at OzFest and I, I remember like I turned  around to my friend, like I was talking, I just turned my, I felt like a twinge of my  back and I was like, oh, then the next day my legs were numb. 
[03:24:00]  So I figured sciatica, like pinched a nerve in my back.  And you just let it go.  Let it go.  And I was like, whatever, it'll heal itself.  Yeah.  I started doing like yoga and Pilates and I was like, this will strengthen my, you know,  this will cure.  And I did some acupuncture and these doctors, I don't need them.  Exactly.  Who can get doctors?  They don't know anything.  Yeah.  But, um, that's a, so, so when you, when this becomes a public thing, when it's like  announced that you have MS, do people start treating you with kid gloves?  Do they start, you know, my mom does really? 
[03:24:30]  She does.  Yeah.  She thinks I'm going to like drop dead at any minute.  So she must've been terrified when you were like, I'm going to do dancing with the stars.  She actually, um, no.  Cause she thought it, she, she realized the kind of, you know, think what you want about  the show.  It gets like 12 million viewers.  And it is a great, you know, platform to kind of go out there.  And if you're trying to get a message across, it's the way to do it.  It's a great way to do it.  And she really thought it would be a good, you know, a good tool for me to kind of help  kind of raise awareness about MS.  How did you tell, how did you tell your parents?  I mean, do you, do you find out like you already know before you go into the doctor's 
[03:25:00]  office or does he say, does he give you the, uh, we're going to need you to come in  on the phone?  Um, well, I, I, after the eye thing, I went the doctor, eye doctor, cause that's where  I went.  I was like, problem with my eye, go to the eye doctor.  He sent me to the hospital immediately.  He was like, Hey, you need to go get an MRI.  And I was like, uh, I don't cure itself.  I'm not going to go.  And so I go to the doctor and, and firstly, when after the MRI, they told me that I thought  they might've had a, I might've had a stroke.  Right.  Um, and then when the neurologist kind of came in, he started talking about, you know, 
[03:25:30]  the idea of MS and then did a bit of investigating into kind of issues that are commonly associated  with MS.  And I kind of came back, uh, positive for a lot of them.  Is it just something that happens?  Like people are born with it and it eventually appears?  You know what?  There's, there's a, yeah.  I mean, essentially, yes.  Yeah.  There's like a little bit of data saying that it's hereditary, but it's commonly,  um, occurs with, um, you know, women for one, it's like a two to one ratio versus, you 
[03:26:00]  know, mental women, uh, get diagnosed with MS, but, uh, it, it's people who have a Northern  European kind of, uh, lineage.  So it's kind of cold, wet, damp countries.  Somehow there was some mutation in genes, people that came from Northern Europe that, uh,  kind of more associated with, with multiple sclerosis.  So how do you handle it?  Like, like, because your life's on a track, you say, okay, I'm going to do this, this 
[03:26:30]  and this, and you plan it out however well you can plan it out.  Especially because the track you were on before, it was like, I'm going to do this adrenaline  junkie stuff.  Right.  It's like a very physically active path that you were starting.  Yeah.  And you say, this is where I want it to go.  And then all of a sudden, like, oh my God, now this is my thing.  Like, now I'm talking about MS and how do you kind of make that comfortable?  Um, it, uh, kind of, I don't know.  It's a good question.  It's, it's, it's, listen, it's one of those things that it sucks. 
[03:27:00]  I would rather not have to talk about it, but, uh, you know, you kind of, I just realized  that when I got diagnosed, I went online and, you know, for better or for worse, and started  looking up like, you know, MS, who has MS, that kind of thing.  And, and, you know, Montel Williams is probably the most outspoken, you know, man who has MS.  And, um, and I actually, I actually contacted Montel relatively soon after my diagnosis.  And he's a huge source of, you know, information for me and really kind of helped that whole, 
[03:27:30]  um, um, you know, process.  Isn't he up and about?  He's doing okay, right?  Montel's, you know, he's had it for a very long time and he is, you know, he's a kind  of a model, you know, student of MS, if you will.  Like he is incredibly, um, active in his health and, and kind of the do's and don'ts, you know,  and he's a good sounding board.  What's a don't?  A don't, um, stress.  So, you know, stress.  I'm the, I'm the, I'm like the worst victim of stress. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  And especially being in the public eye, I would think when your whole family's in the  public eye to not stress, like every other day, there's so, especially your mom, she's  like a pit bull out there.  Pretty much.  You know, something to say about somebody and you have to be like, oh, it's just mommy,  mom.  It's just mommy, mom.  Woosha, woosha.  Um, yeah.  So, I mean, stress is a big no, no.  Um, you know, there's a, there's diet.  People say diet plays a huge role in it.  I believe that to be true.  Did you have to give up anything you really liked eating? 
[03:28:30]  Um, you know, I'm, I'm a big fan of moderation.  So I kind of look at it like, you know, don't give it up.  Just, you know, minimize, um, you know, before doing dancing with the stars, uh, you know,  I'd really kind of cut out gluten and wheat and, and all that stuff.  Cause it kind of associated with inflammation at the end of the day.  MS is about inflammation.  Did you ever think, uh, there's Joe Rogan and a bunch of guys have talked about that treatment  they're doing in Germany now where you go and they, they spin your blood and they put, 
[03:29:00]  have you heard about that?  And they put it back in.  It's supposed to help with all kinds of problems that are, are caused by inflammation.  Yeah.  There's, I mean, there's, you know, Germany is a kind of, is the, uh, you know, my opinion  is kind of the forefront of kind of, it's almost like new, new age medication and treatment.  Um, but it's, it's not kind of, you know, we don't have, you know, we're kind of confined  within the, the, the restrictions of the federal government here.  Yeah.  You can, well, you can go over there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can, absolutely.  You know, it's, uh, it's, you know, they do have some amazing treatments over there. 
[03:29:30]  Um, but, uh, you know, not to say though, that they don't have really good stuff.  I mean, in the last 10 years alone, the amount of kind of treatments they have now for,  you know, MS is, is awesome.  And the treatment that I, that I'm on is, it's pretty unique because at the end of the  day, it's just amino acids.  So it's not like a, I, you know, I'm not like pumping like some crazy long winded chemical  in me that I'm like, I don't know what that is.  And so I kind of look at it like it's, I justify it to myself because it's more holistic. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah.  But the stem cells, are they still working with stem cells to fit?  I mean, I think that's probably where they're going to cure most of these things.  Yeah.  You know, I, I, I think that down the road we will start seeing, you know, stem cells being  a lot more kind of, uh, socially acceptable in the States because I think there's such a stigma  around it here because they don't quite, you know, I think the, the public perception is  that you're injecting dead babies into you.  Right.  That's not what them open and we pour out the stem cells.  We shake out the good stuff and throw them away.  Right.  That's not what it is.  And, and, and, you know, and it's, um, you know, so I, I think why, I think down the road 
[03:30:30]  people will, when we, when they kind of crack it and really figure it out.  So how do you deal with family stress that kind of everybody becomes aware of that if you have  to specifically not be stressed? Like when, when, you know, not only do you have to deal  with, you know, your dad relapsing or your parents separating and then you think you're  done dealing with that, but then everybody becomes aware of it. So it becomes a whole  other thing.  Um, you know, by, by the time people do become aware of things, it, I'm usually like, it's 
[03:31:00]  kind of, it's just that, like I'm like over it. And so it's just kind of, you don't really  care when, when everybody else is, I don't care what people say. Like I, I know what, you  know, I experienced that and I know what it is and then we're good.  I, uh, I was on Twitter and, uh, I follow Ozzy and Sharon on Twitter. I've, I've tried  to keep it. I'm a fan of Ozzy. I've kept it under my hat, but I might as well be public  about it now. But he tweeted something, uh, recently about, uh, to my brother, my brother-in-law  and name only. I was like, somebody hacked Ozzy's Twitter. Cause that was so unlike something. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah. And then your mom, uh, uh, oh boy, do you not want to fuck with her? She Twittered  something. She wrote an open letter on Facebook. Oh yeah. And I'm only asking you  about it because it stemmed from something to do with you. Yeah. And, uh, has that situation,  what was happening to this brother-in-law was trying to help you? Yeah. I mean, it kind  of, the long and short of it is that, um, that guy's a dick. He's your, he's your mom's  brother, mom's brother. And he's like, he's just, you know, he did this whole article being 
[03:32:00]  like, I wish Sharon would, would, uh, you know, allow me back into the life. Cause I want  to help Jack with his MS cause my uncle has MS. And I'm like, really dude, like you have  my email, you have my phone number. If you really wanted to help me, you could have dropped  me a line, but instead you sell a story to the British tabloids. Right. And, but that's  just the kind of guy he is. He's like a, a total deadbeat, like, you know, criminal. I  mean, he's just glomming on to whatever. Cause Oh, maybe I get a book out of this. Maybe  I'll be able to go on talk shows. And he's had some, you know, he's had a lot of resentments 
[03:32:30]  towards my family and my mom in particular. Um, and he's just, he's kind of, he's that  guy. Does that happen a lot in like in your family? Cause I would imagine, you know, your  whole family unit has been so successful. We were just talking before you came in that  like you and Kelly have gone on from the reality show to become hugely successful on your own  and past it and everything. Is there jealousy in your family of people who are like, ah, why  do they get to be the famous ones? Right. Um, there are yes and no. Yeah. I mean that 
[03:33:00]  there's, you know, family members that are really supportive and doing, you know, enjoy  the kind of having us as family members and that's all, that's all is. And then there's  family members that are, you know, kind of have the handout type, you know, you know,  a lot. Do you ever want to tell your mom, just please don't mention plastic surgeries  about your genitals anymore in public? Cause it's not something I want to read about.  No, I, it's one of those things where I'm just, I'm choosing to put my head in the sand 
[03:33:30]  about that. Maybe at Christmas dinner, you know, I can bring that up. Well, maybe I'm  wrong, but I forwarded the article to my mother. Just food for thought, mom. For Christmas,  my, my, my Christmas gift to her is going to be me basically making her never mention  that again. Yeah. Well that's, but that's why the Osborne, there's something, it's like  you guys are so open with stuff. It's hard to, to quote unquote, get you on anything.  Okay. There's open and then there's just fucked up. Yeah. But there's nothing that 
[03:34:00]  they're going to come out with the family that the people are going to go, Oh my God,  that's terrible. Because you, whatever it is, you just talk about it, whether it was  plastic surgery or relapsing. And once you talk about something, it takes people's ability  to fuck with you over it almost completely. And that's actually kind of been something that  we've all kind of agreed on since day one. It's no matter you, you, you cannot work in  entertainment and kind of be in the limelight and have these deep, dark, evil secrets because  they, you know, inevitably they will catch up to you and they'll be the source of scandal 
[03:34:30]  and demise. And so if you just kind of own it and wear it on your sleeve, like, Hey, this  is who I am. This is what I do. You know, cause then no one can mess with you.  And it's also, it's, it's strange that people also are not interested when they find out that  nothing you're saying is true. There've been so many family reality shows that are kind  of copying what the Osbornes started, but almost all of them are all just made up and scripted  and none of them work like the Osbornes did. Yeah. I mean, it's true, but it's a, but then 
[03:35:00]  again, that that's a, that's a, it's just a different beast now reality from when we did  it to what it is now. I mean, when we did it, there was a lot more money in it and you  could afford to film seven days, you know, and 18 hours a day and just cut something  together. It was really filming somebody's life. Yeah. And now it's because of the restraints  of budgets. You go, okay, you got four days a week to film and we need to know what we're  going to be filming. So here's the script and go assisted reality. They call it assisted  reality. It's just such bullshit. And that's why, but that's why the Osbornes came off as 
[03:35:30]  genuine and really funny and honest. And this stuff comes off as just crap. And the dramatic  music makes up for the lack of true content. It stinks now. Yeah. And you guys were all so  interesting. Like it wasn't just like, Oh, look at this family. They're rich and on  television. Yeah. Watch them. You know what I mean? Well, we have to, we have to wrap  up with Jack. Um, I have to leave you guys. Yeah. They, they, they, they, they, they  see you have other stuff. Uh, stay here forever with you, Jim. We'd love you, Jack. We'd love  you to come in five days a week. Just us. Sweet TV. Uh, sweet.tv. S C H W E T dot TV is 
[03:36:00]  I guess your website. Uh, yeah, but for the, uh, but for the kind of campaign it's, you don't  know Jack about ms.com. Okay. That's where all the information is. And we made these like  little webisodes at Jack Osborne on Twitter, which I know we used to be Mr. Jacko or something.  You finally got your name. Yeah. Michael Jackson called and said he wanted, um, you, I was  gonna, I was wondering you do so much, you've gone on to do so much TV production work and  behind the scenes and you directed the documentary and everything. Were you kind of, I know you did 
[03:36:30]  dance with the stars, but were you kind of over being on camera all the time? Yeah. A lot  of that. And a lot of it comes down to control. Like, you know, you might, I might be on a  TV show, whatever it's, but you're kind of, I always say like, you're like a talking box  of tide. It's like, go out there and do this. Like, okay. Right. You've rather the input  behind the scenes. Yeah, exactly. And when you're a producer, you're a part of the creative  and from soup to nuts. Yeah. And by the way, can I say how much I hate Rolling Stone  magazine, the 50 top albums of, of this year and they don't name 13 as one. Like I just, 
[03:37:00]  oh, it really bugs me. Yeah. But it's also the same magazine that put the fucking Boston  Bomber. Absolutely. Looking like a, looking like a Backstreet Boy. Like, are you surprised?  No, and it doesn't surprise me. And what is it in music where there's this, this, like  they, where the people think like they don't give Sabbath what they should have gotten, but  in excess of geniuses. It drives me nuts. But Rolling Stone is definitely more fixated  on selling to teenage girls, even if they have to glamorize the Boston Bomber and teenage  girls aren't listening to Sabbath. I feel my, I might have a slight bit of responsibility  for that. Cause I did have a petition on change.org and got like 75,000 signatures to make 
[03:37:30]  Rolling Stone donate the profits of the magazine to the victims, but Rolling Stone just ignored  it. Of course. Well, they got to keep their profits, right? Jack Osborne, again, at Jack  Osborne on Twitter. You don't know Jack about ms.com and then sweet.tv, but it's spelled S-C-H-W-E-E-T  dot, uh, TV. Yeah. We're going to take a break. Thank you, Jack. Hey, thanks guys. Good chat.  All right, man. 
[03:38:00]  You bet it is. Jack Osborne was a lot of fun. You're out of here, Jim?  Yeah, I got to go to the gym. Bye guys.  All right. I'll see you. Oh, that's what I meant to, I wanted to have the clip of you doing  the going to the gym thing and playing it for Jack. Oh, I spaced on it. Ah, you know  what though? You can always play the clip of when I told the story on the Tonight Show.  Thanks, Jim. Way to feel proud of yourself, buddy. Fuck yeah. Way to feel proud. I'll 
[03:38:30]  see you. Roland's following Jim out, still walking a little bit like John Wayne. We got a Nick  in Tennessee. What's up, buddy? All right, man. Here it goes. Sam Roberts after show.  It's the place to go to find out all the crazy shit from the ONA show. I love that. That was  wonderful. You're on Blu-ray, buddy. You're on Blu-ray? Yeah, sure, dude. All right. I'll 
[03:39:00]  send you, uh, I'll send you Pacific Rim on Blu-ray. I got it, man. All right. Then I'll send  you, uh, I'll send you We're the Millers on Blu-ray. Do it up, brother. All right. Hold  on. A little treat for Nick. 661. Hello? What's up? You're on the air. Okay. No, your phone  sucks. 734. What's up? You're on the air. Hey, Samuel. How are you doing today, sir? What's  up, buddy? Hey, uh, all years of, uh, encountering with wrestlers, what's, apart from Virgil, what's 
[03:39:30]  been like the worst encounter you've had with a wrestler, a pro wrestler? That's a good  question. I don't know. I haven't really had a lot of bad encounters with wrestlers. Like  I have encounters that I think aren't going to go that great. You'd think some of the  big stars would not be terribly friendly, but they always are. I mean, every time I, I  don't think I've ever done an interview where they've been shitty. Um, I used to go to a  comic, little comic conventions, little small ones, whatnot, and some of the wrestlers would 
[03:40:00]  show up. And the best encounter I ever had, I live in the Detroit area. It's a snowy, by  the way. Um, these, George Animal Steel was showing up at a little comic convention. I  followed him to his table and he didn't charge for autographs. This is my greatest by like  96, 97, but he didn't charge for autographs. He said his, his opinion was that he considered  it, you know, you know, fan appreciation. Now he said, if you need to buy a photograph,  he'd tell you the photo, he never sold his autograph. As a matter of fact, he ended up 
[03:40:30]  having a service where you can buy a photo. He signed a photograph of him choking me and  even had the green tongue and everything else. And that was pretty fricking cool.  That's cool. Yeah. But he's going to go broke. You got to sell your autograph. What else do  you have? You're George, the animal steel.  I think George, you know, actually, if I'm not mistaken, I mean, I think he's like coach football  like in the Detroit area.  Yeah. Well, sell some autographs. Like it's not like, guess what? Nothing in Detroit is exactly  doing wealthy right now. Maybe sell a couple autographs to get yourself a nice dinner.  Thanks, buddy. Thanks, Noe.  All right. Thanks, man. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah. I mean, the time, the only time I blew it meeting a wrestler was I rode up an elevator  with the Undertaker one time on the way to the Hall of Fame ceremony. And I was too afraid  to say anything. I just stood there in the back of the elevator staring at the back of  his head while he wore a fedora and a tattoo on the back of his neck.  I used to love the Undertaker.  He's the fucking man. And he never does, and he never does press. He doesn't do interviews  because he doesn't really break character much. And, and he doesn't do conventions. So  that was my shot. I was in an elevator with him and nothing. I was just, he's huge, right? 
[03:41:30]  He's like six, eight, six, 10.  Yeah. He's a giant.  I mean, I would love to meet him.  He said, well, so would I, and I had a shot and I blew it. So you don't have to rub it  in.  I'm sorry.  All right. Let me do it. Jeez. The phones are blowing. Oh, everybody thinks I'm going to  give him a blue right now. Three, six, one.  Sam.  What's up, buddy?  You disappointed me. How could you not bring up Tupac? All Eyes on Me is the greatest double  album ever.  That is a good double album.  Excellent double album.  Excellent double album. Yeah. Most double albums though, especially after like the seventies, 
[03:42:00]  I, I, I can't stand most double albums. Even Jay-Z put out a double album and everybody knows  what a big Jay-Z mark I am. If you condense Jay-Z's double album down to one album, it'd be phenomenal.  I think that's the way it is with, I really do think it's the way with almost all double  albums that if you could just trim the fat, say goodbye to some songs that you like and  just put on the great ones, you would have this timeless album. Even, even Ready to Die, 
[03:42:30]  Biggie Small's double album. It's his last album. I know you're trying to push out as much  shit as you can or, and you don't want to say anything bad about Biggie. Condense it down  to one album. All right. Thanks buddy. Uh, Mike in Florida. He wanted to get a slob  over. Oh, did he?  Love your show, dude. Thanks Mike.  Fantastic. And, uh, two things. One, I met Bob Backlund many years ago at the Nassau Coliseum. 
[03:43:00]  He's a maniac.  Yeah, he was actually really cool. Yeah. Uh, he was getting ready before a match and he  was all the way up in the fucking top of the stands and we just saw him sitting there  in his tights. With the fans in the building? Yeah, it was in the building. My buddy's like,  hey, that's Backlund. So we talked and we said, hey, you know, good luck and all that. We're  little kids. But he was really cool. Really nice guy. Dude, I met, I met Bob Backlund like  I was saying at a show before the show. He was taking pictures outside and, uh, I took a photo 
[03:43:30]  with him. He put me in a cross-faced chicken wing. That's his submission move. And he puts his  arm around my neck and he pulls back my other arm and, and, and it, you could tell he was  one centimeter away from applying that pressure and just breaking my entire collarbone, just  destroying my frame. And, and he's got me in this chicken wing, so I'm not escaping anytime  soon. And they take the, the professional photographer takes a photo and then I tell  Jess, my wife, to sit there with her camera and take one with her cell phone. And so she's 
[03:44:00]  got her phone up and, and Bob Backlund completely politely with me still in the cross-faced  chicken wing goes, Oh, is that young lady with you? And I go, yeah, she is with me. And  he drags me by my neck and arm over to the cell phone. And he goes, you're going to take  a picture too. Take a picture. Take a picture of this. And I'm going, what the fuck is going  on? Has he lost it?  Oh, and, and, and, and it's my first time on the air with you. They're fantastic. But 
[03:44:30]  but, uh, Janet, uh, Janet Jameson, you, man, you guys got to do a follow-up on that. That  thing was phenomenal.  I was hoping Jack Osborne would come in here all pilled up and crying. We could get another,  we could get another rub off that, but it didn't work out. Thanks, Mike.  Yeah. All right. Take care, man.  All right, buddy. Uh, Dustin on Long Island.  Hey, what's up? It's actually Austin, Sammy. I'm wondering what you're going to sell your  autograph for one day.  However much I can get people to pay for it. I'm going to be like Virgil. I'm going to  be out there. Like, I'm not going to have a sign with the price on it. It's just going 
[03:45:00]  to, I'm going to start with something big. And then the minute I say, well, we'll do it  for 50. We'll do 50. I'll go down to whatever, $2. But if I can get some, I'll give you the  first of all, I'll give you $2 to sign my fucking, uh, Sam and Dave, uh, puzzle, uh, that  I put together. We quit dodging me on this.  All right. We give me 70, 70. We just agreed on two.  We give me 70. How about 40, 40, $40. How about $30? I said 30, $15. Give me 15.  Are you going to cut Dave some of that?  Fuck no. Dave, who's Dave? 
[03:45:30]  No, then you got 15, baby.  All right. All right, Dustin, send it in. I'll sign it for, well, I'll make it 17.  All right. Appreciate it.  All right, buddy. Uh, Sal, would you bet, pay for my autograph?  Uh, no.  How much?  You'd have to...  $9. $9.  I'll give you nine.  You'd give me $9 for an autograph?  No, I don't want it.  $9.  It would be...  Would you do it for nine?  No.  $9.  $8.  $8.50.  $8.25.  $8.00.  I'll give it for $8.00.  Yes.  Deal.  Okay, you owe me $8.00. 
[03:46:00]  Uh, Rick in Brooklyn.  Hey, Sam.  How's it going?  I used to haul professional wrestling when WCW was back in business.  Yeah.  And the best wrestler I ever encountered, uh, was Chris Benoit.  I rode up in the elevator when I'm 6'4".  Uh-huh.  And he's like five, maybe five-eight at the time.  You know, and...  Yeah, he's tiny.  Super nice guy.  Yeah, I think, uh, I think the problem that a lot of people have with Chris Benoit is that  he killed his family and himself. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah.  He killed his son.  He choked him to death, and he, uh, then hung himself on a weight bench.  I think that's kind of the, that's where that issue comes up.  I know he was nice in the elevator and all.  No, no.  Even, even outside the elevator.  He's a nice guy.  Uh, like Kevin Nash.  Huge guy.  Uh, you know, like, we had a show up in Buffalo.  And after the show, we went back to the hotel, and all the drivers stayed at the same hotel.  Were you a truck driver? 
[03:47:00]  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  So, uh, we would go down to the bar, and, uh, we would sit around with everybody and  just, I mean, it was like, not only was the wrestlers robbing the bank with that company,  but the drivers were, too.  I mean, we were making hand over fist of money.  A friend of mine met, uh, a friend of mine met Kevin Nash.  And Kevin Nash just started, you know, he played Diesel.  And Kevin Nash just started talking his ear off about Gordie Howe and all these old NHL players.  I think, I think he was just thankful that he could talk to somebody about something 
[03:47:30]  besides wrestling at one of those shows.  And you know what, Sam?  And that is the truth.  If you get, outside of your interviews that you do, if you talk non-wrestling with these  guys, like Rick and Scott Steiner, they're friends of mine, I would go to their house  and go four-wheeling with them.  And they live in the north of Atlanta.  No, I'm not bragging.  Not one bit.  But when you talk to these guys, as a human, instead of being, uh, I'm not calling you  a fanboy, I'm just saying, in general, being the fan guy. 
[03:48:00]  Well, yeah, I mean, look, I ask them about wrestling when I'm interviewing them, but I'm  not sitting there asking them a whole bunch of wrestling questions outside of it.  But yeah, I mean, they get fanboys all the time.  Yeah, totally.  Thanks, Rick.  Yeah, go ahead.  If you didn't give away that Blu-ray on Pacific Rim, can I have it?  Yeah, hold on.  Give Rick Pacific Rim.  Uh, Mike in Tampa.  Hey, how are you, Sam?  Good, buddy.  Good, man.  When I was going to school in the mid-'80s, I used to work at a Bennigan's here in Tampa,  and Gordon Soley used to come in a couple nights a week and just get blind drunk at the bar, man. 
[03:48:30]  I don't know what it is about those old announcers, but I saw, uh, when Eric and me were in Florida  for WrestleMania, we were hanging out at the Hard Rock after some press event, and Mean Gene  Okerlund was just getting plastered, hitting on every female radio personality that was there.
