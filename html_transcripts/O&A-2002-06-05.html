<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with advertisements before diving into the fallout from an incident where the hosts stole a female co-worker's wig.  Listener calls poured in, with some expressing outrage and others offering support.  The hosts admitted they went too far but also criticized the co-worker's past behavior and tendency to "play the pathetic card."  Opie promised a later apology.  A caller then recounted a humorous overheard conversation from a women's restroom stall.  The discussion returned to the wig incident, with more calls, some offering to house the co-worker, and others criticizing the hosts.  The hosts reiterated their support for her despite her continued presence in their lives.  The show concluded this segment with a caller upset about their unwitting involvement in the wig incident, and another mentioning R. Kelly's child pornography indictment, prompting a brief discussion about the dangers of taping sexual encounters.

The show then transitioned to a segment heavily focused on "Patty," a listener obsessed with Opie.  The hosts detailed her repeated rejection of job offers, housing, and financial aid to remain near Opie and the show.  They discussed listener emails criticizing her behavior and lack of responsibility.  Opie recounted Patty following him to Penn Station and joining him for breakfast.  He expressed significant frustration with her actions. This section also included tangents: a listener who films and sells sex tapes online; Opie's story about a photo of his naked stepmother; an on-air incident that angered Anthony's family; a listener's wedding with mob connections; more discussion of R. Kelly's legal issues; a call supporting Opie's harsh treatment of Patty; mention of an upcoming Jim Florentine appearance; and a listener who stalked Opie's brother.  Numerous advertisements punctuated this segment.  In-studio guest Jim Brewer, MVP of a celebrity softball game, joined the conversation.  A significant portion focused on anecdotes about comedian Tracy Morgan's outrageous behavior.  The hosts also shared their anxieties about navigating New York City's public transportation system.

Next, the show tackled Kreskin's prediction of a massive UFO sighting in Nevada.  The hosts and callers speculated humorously, referencing past Kreskin appearances, including one where he wore makeup anticipating media coverage for a Bin Laden-related stunt.  The conversation veered into discussions of kickball, a caller getting lost in the desert, and a news report suggesting the sighting might be satellites.  The upcoming Lennox Lewis vs. Mike Tyson fight was also mentioned, along with comedic banter and a caller with cerebral palsy sharing stand-up comedy anecdotes.  Several calls filled this segment, interspersed with more advertisements.

A segment featuring comedian Mike as a guest followed.  He discussed his career, including working with Paul Mercurio, and joked about driving behind slow tractor trailers.  The hosts then discussed a tape of Boss's 13-year-old stand-up routine, commenting on his appearance and drug use.  Jim Brewer briefly reappeared. A call from a man whose extended, comedically awkward conversation with his wife about his late arrival home from the studio dominated the latter half.  The show then moved to a "wow" contest, with mentions of upcoming shows, ticket giveaways, and numerous advertisements for various products and services, including Venom energy drink, the Rolling Rock Town Fair, and the Lewis vs. Tyson fight.  A conversation with "Psycho Tim" about motorcycle stickers and Laconia Bike Week concluded this segment, followed by a heated discussion about "Lady Di," a regular caller deemed not contributive enough.  They put her "on the bubble," giving her a week to improve or face removal from the show, announcing a monthly "weeding" process based on listener votes on their website.

The show continued with "Opie and Anthony Survivor," focusing on Lady Di's struggle to devise a challenge to avoid elimination.  Callers offered suggestions, all rejected.  Lady Di left a voicemail to correct a photo caption, highlighting her self-centeredness.  A segment followed where callers shared what they learned that day, including vulgar and sexually suggestive comments.  Further discussion revolved around Lady Di's challenge, with suggestions ranging from harmless to explicit, including a proposition to have sex on air. The segment concluded with promotional announcements for sponsors, a brief mention of Brooke Burke, and a preview of "Friend or Foe."

So many people want to just focus on the negative  We're here to say, look what a beautiful Whip Em Out Wednesday it is  And look at all the happiness we have brought you over the years  With this positive bit we like to call Whip Em Out Wednesday, Anthony 
[00:06:30]  Do we get letters on a daily basis, Opie  About how great WOW is  And how many people have been WOWed  And how thankful they are  That we came up with this little Whip Em Out Wednesday thing  I don't think as many people send us emails about good things like that  No, when something  They just accept it  When something good happens  Uh-huh  Because of this radio show  Yeah  They don't write us a letter  They just accept it  They just enjoy it  And assume it's what we do  Right  For them  But God had messed up once 
[00:07:00]  Holy crap  Holy crap  You are a man obsessed  I am feeling the heat  Here's us in the office  Everyone's going through the newspapers  You know, online  Checking things out  Here's Opie  Oh  Oh, this one don't look good  That's just a couple  A couple hundred more  This one  Oh

Well, then there's this  Oh, no 
[00:08:00]  Oh  Got a positive  Got a positive  And then  And then he has this  Then Opie has this idea  That perhaps  The people that are writing  With the positive emails  Are people  He really doesn't want  Writing him positive emails  Well, because they try to make me feel good  By saying, you know  I enjoyed what happened  In the last two days  Yeah  It reminded me of  When I was growing up  Next to this retarded kid 
[00:08:30]  And we threw bricks at him every day  So I really like what you did  Anytime you want to come over  And club baby seals with me  So I'm thinking  You know what?  I don't think that's too positive  I'm just like you, man  I'm just like you  No, you're not  Hey, let's go rise to the phones  Max, what's going on today?  Hey, I just wanted to say  That you guys are like the stock market  When you're going along  Everyone's laughing  And then all of a sudden  They think they're funny  They don't get the joke all of a sudden 
[00:09:00]  Then they call and complain  Call their analysts  Something's wrong  Something's wrong  Where were you when the show was good?  Yeah  Yeah  Exactly  Next time we do something nice  Why don't you send off  A cute little email to us?  Yeah  Make us feel good  No one called Henry Blodget  And said you're the best  Amazon's the best  Thanks  They all thought they were a mastermind  Then it goes down  They call up Henry Blodget  You jerk  Right  Look what happened with Enron  Yeah, exactly  You know, there was a time  Enron was rocking  I'm sure no one wrote  Nice little emails to Enron 
[00:09:30]  And you guys have been  Doing nothing but soaring  Nobody complained  When you were soaring  And they got all the jokes  They were the funny ones  You guys weren't funny  But now all of a sudden  You're not funny  You're not funny  No, we're kind of funny  But as soon as that  Enron disaster happened  Oh my God  Now  You scumbags  I'm just surprised  Patty got it  Before the retards  Hey, who knew  That she was going to react  Like that  Who knew?  You never know  Who knew Enron?  Who knew?  She has barely shown  A human emotion  In the last four years 
[00:10:00]  I didn't know  Who saw that one coming?  I didn't know  She was going to just  Take it completely  Over the top like that  You know  Who knew?  She had been out  Previously  Remember when  We shaved her head  For the U2 tickets  Remember that?  Yeah, last October  Shaved her head  Completely bald  She was walking around  And people were complimenting her  Right  On her bald head  And the nice shape  Of her head  And whatnot  And  Well, I just assumed  She  She didn't mind  Being out in public  With her bald head showing 
[00:10:30]  I'm not going to lie to you  I didn't think  The wig thing  Was a big deal  Because we had  I know  You're yelling at your radio now  Let me try to explain  I can hear them  They're yelling so loud today  I can hear them  Oh, you can try to explain  But we've had her out in public  Like you just said  Without the wig on  Many, many times  She kind of  Kind of likes showing everybody  Yeah  You know  What she did for the radio show  And then  I don't know  She just  She lost her mind  I had no idea  She was going to react like that  She then just lost her mind 
[00:11:00]  Oh, well  Oh, well  Let's go to Billy  Hey, Billy  What's up?  What's going on, guys?  You tell me, Billy  Yeah, man  I agree with what you did  I don't think it was nice  Or great  But  It had to come  Because  You know  A couple years now  She's been  Bugging you guys  And you're like  Bring her in as a goof  But next thing you know  She's on Ron and Fez  She's on  For real  I'm getting sick of it, man  That's the only way to tell her 
[00:11:30]  That it was over  The only way to do it  All right  You know what I'm saying?  Okay, Billy  Thank you  All right  Well, where do we go from here, Anthony?  Because that's all anyone wants to talk about once again today  Well  I think  I think she's okay  I wouldn't worry about it  She's okay?  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Stephanie, what's going on?  Yeah  Hi  Yeah, what's going on? 
[00:12:00]  Yeah  I just wanted to ask you  How come you have to pull up for a wig?  Why couldn't you just like  Send powers to go away  Whatever  Like, why'd you have to pull up for a wig also?  See, the wig part  I guess  Really put it over the top  And really got everyone hating  Yes  Uh, me  Right  I would love to say hating us  But at this point it's  No, hating me  I did this  I was cool when you sent her wig  But like, once you pulled up for a wig  She was like crying  I felt so bad for her  Stephanie, we  I tried to explain a few minutes ago  We had no idea she was going to react like that 
[00:12:30]  No clue  We were basing this on the prior four years  That she had been on this program  And how she had responded to other things  Similar to this  And, uh, wow  She just was in some mood, I guess  What was the point?  Like, something early  I mean, it wasn't in her life  She got kicked out of her apartment  Because of you guys  Like, you know, this whole thing  But  Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  She likes to  She likes to blame everything on us  I'm not going to accept that  We brought her a lot of positive things  And given her a life  Of course  I mean, you guys were so good  To give her money and everything  What it comes down to is  The place she was staying 
[00:13:00]  In Staten Island  If you want to look into this  Uh, they were just waiting  Uh, looking for an excuse  To throw her out  I didn't see anybody else  Forking over hundreds of bucks  To the girl  You know what I mean?  Yeah, you guys are really cool about that  Come on  Well, you know, that hurt in the email  A lot of people are saying  Look, you did a lot of nice things for her  But no money ever came out of your pocket  Ever opened  No one has a clue  How much money we gave this girl  Oh, stop it  This girl  And you know something?  After all is said and done  And after all this just goes away 
[00:13:30]  She still will be hanging around  She's going to come back to you guys?  There's no getting rid of her  We've tried to get rid of her  And she just keeps coming back  There's no getting rid of her  She'll be there  She goes to events  She's out  I swear I saw her last night at Bar 9  I swear I saw her  You saw Patty last night?  Standing there  I certainly did  Saw her last night  Now, Bar 9 is the gig that your brother Joe does every Tuesday

Well, what am I supposed to do about it? 
[00:14:30]  No, I just figured I'd tell you  Alright, she's allowed to go places  I'm not going to kick her out of Bar 9  I guess she wasn't that distraught  So, yeah, she's still going to our events  And our things and functions  And hanging with the people  Which is, you know what I'm saying?  I don't have a problem  Fine  A day after that traumatic experience  Right  She was at the next ONA event  She was there  It's not really an ONA event  Well, it's a lot  The majority of the people that go there  Are ONA fans  Yeah  And there she was 
[00:15:00]  And everybody sang her  A rousing rendition of Happy Birthday  And she was very happy  And she is absolutely fine  That's my latest report  From Patty  A lot more interesting  What happened in the bathroom  That night  Oh, you were telling us that  You got to say it on the radio  I don't know  You know something?  I know I'm not the only guy  That has done this  I'm sure guys have heard some really funny crap  Literally 
[00:15:30]  In the bathroom  I'm at Bar 9 last night  And I had to take a dump  Just say that  Men's room  In any bar  Especially a smaller club  In New York City  Disgusting  Just heinous  You whip it out  And you take a whiz  That's what you do  In those  You don't sit down  You don't use the bowl  So I look  The girls' room door is wide open  You see all the stalls there 
[00:16:00]  There's no girls in the bathroom  And there's not as many girls in the club as guys  So I'm figuring  Squeeze one out  I'm fine  I walk  I get in the stall  I shut the door  I start doing my business  I finish my business  You got to know that girls are going to come in at any moment  I know  But I'm hoping  I'm taking the gamble  I got audio of you in the  Oh, you know?  The ladies' room at Bar 9 last night  What is this? 
[00:16:30]  No  No  Alright, alright, alright  No  So you go into the stall  Without getting too descriptive  Thank God  It was one of those  That you don't got to worry about  Very quick  You're in the ladies' room  It was a fast strike  Yeah, yeah  I finished my business  How many wipes?  Did the quick  Oh, it was like nothing  One?  Believe me, yeah 
[00:17:00]  One  A quick one?  Quick one  And then the backup to make sure  That's all  Second one, not even necessary  I mean, it was really a good  It was like  It was like a bombing run  And you were surprised  Like, oh, look at this  In, out, no flack  You're like, hey, hey  I'm making it back to base  So I finished my business  The quick  Courtesy flush  Looked just like  I mean, it barely tapered  And I hit the flush  Hold on  I want to get back  To the, you know  What you do afterwards  Right  Did it look like  A little kid's 
[00:17:30]  Crayon drawing?  Or was it more like  You know  No, it was  I don't know  Was it more like  You spilled a lot of guacamole?  No  No, it was like a  Barely  Like if you had an old  Coffee stain on a cloth napkin  And it washed it many times  So you could barely notice  I was very happy  It was all gooey  No, no  It was not all gooey  Everything was fine 
[00:18:00]  So I finished  And like I said  The very quick  Push  Courtesy flush  Immediately  Immediately  Because I don't want  To stink up the joint  Just in case  Good thing too  Here it comes  I hear them coming down the stairs  Two of them  Two of them  They walk in  Now I'm like  Uh oh  Uh oh  So I don't know why I did this  But I climbed up 
[00:18:30]  Onto the toilet bowl  And held the door  And locked it  So I'm like  That's kind of odd  Because there's no feet  Under there  You could have gotten  In trouble last night  I know  They report you  Well next thing you know  They're like screaming  There's a pervert  I know  That's why  Yeah, no  I didn't start  Cranking it, Rick  So I'm  Just standing on the bowl  And I'm holding  The door shut  And  One of the girls goes  Well there's 
[00:19:00]  There's no feet  On the floor  Because I guess  They had said like  And she said loudly  There's no feet  On the floor  Is someone in there  Now I'm like  Oh boy  Here I go  You gotta say something  Now I gotta say something  So  I'm laughing to myself  As I just  Figure out  The least  I have to say  For them to know  Someone's in there  But not identify  Myself as a guy  Here's  What that sounded like  Ready  Uh huh  Okay 
[00:19:30]  Say  Is somebody in there  Is somebody in there  You did not  I did  I cleared my throat  In girly fashion  I went  You made it sound like  Someone was tied up  And  I  That's what I thought  That's what I thought  And then I had to  Put my feet down  Because why the hell  Am I so  What am I floating  Above it  So I put them down  But I tuck them  So close  And under the ball  So they can't 
[00:20:00]  Get a look at my  My sneakers  Right  Which you know  You can then look  And see that they're mine  So I put my feet down  And go  And then she goes  Oh okay  And then they  Wouldn't shut up  Talking about people  At the softball game  Because they were fans  Of the show  Talking about people  At the softball game  Talking about some people  From message force  That have facial hair  And they're girls  Really

[00:21:00]  In the girls room  After I went  I didn't give myself up  Oh that's awful  And I heard that  That's awful  Then I start hearing  A story about  Some girl  That uh  Is having problems  Because the guy  She was with  Is having sex  With another girl  That they all know  And I'm just like  This is some great stuff  This is great stuff  I should just do this 
[00:21:30]  I should just do this  One of the magazines  Does that  Yeah  What is it  Maxim  Or is it stuff  It's one of them  And they have  Bathroom conversations  Where I guess  They use a girl  A girl goes into  The ladies room  That would be easier  Sure  Obviously  Goes in the stall  Like you  Just sits there  For a couple hours  And eavesdrop  On the conversation  Then they print  The best ones  In the magazine  God we ought to  Steal that immediately  Can we do that  What are the legal  Ramifications  Of airing that

[00:26:00]  Anyway  Yeah  So  So Bob's like  On my right  Jeff Levine's  On my left  And Tony Michaels  Who pretty much  Owned the station  Was there too  And  You know  They were  Talking very nicely  To me  About the job  I was doing  For their fine  Radio station  And there was  An intern  That was giving me  A handy  Can I say that  You could say  A handy  She was  Yeah  She was standing  Next to me  But because  We're all bar level  These three guys 
[00:26:30]  Had no clue  That she was  Wait  She's giving you  A handy  At the bar  Oh yeah  Right in front  Of Bob  Jeff and Tony  Hey  Look at that  Hope  He's getting  A little handy  But no one  No one knew  You know  I once  Almost got a handy  From Pat Benatar  You know  She's  Long Island  Ray  It was at  The zebra  Concert  Speaking of  Handy  Let's give a  Hand to  Billy Joe  Anyway 
[00:27:00]  So she's  She's working  For joints  Right in front  Of these guys  No one has a clue  And I'm like  Hey look at this  Hey  Hey  This is something  That doesn't happen  Every day  Ain't that a fine  How do you do  So  So now  You quickly think  Well we gotta  We gotta take care  Of business here  So logically  The best choice  Was the  The ladies room  Ah  I don't know why  It was a full house  Man  Well the men's room 
[00:27:30]  Not a classy move  You ever seen  That scene in Scarface  Where  You know  Brings Tony's sister  Into the men's room  Not a classy move  Just a tad  Classier  Is the ladies room  But still  Very degenerate move  So believe it or not  Like yourself  I was able to get in there  When no one else  Was in there  At least you had a girl  To go  Right  We get in  We get in the stall  And I'm sitting  And she's  Let's just say  Kneeling 
[00:28:00]  Oh  Okay  Can we  Let me just say this  Was she doing  Something different  Than she was doing  At the bar  Oh yeah  Oh okay  Could she perform this  And juggle at the same time  Theoretically  Oh yeah  Alright  I think we can figure it out  If I'm sitting  She's kneeling  Just wanna make sure  So now  Now I'm  I'm completely hammered  And girls are coming and going  And I'm like  Wow there's a lot of traffic  Traffic in here all of a sudden  The reason there was so much traffic  The word was out 
[00:28:30]  Uh oh  And every single female  And I guess a bunch of guys as well  Hey hey  Had to check it out  Now could you look under  And see her legs  And your feet  And  Yeah of course  Cause it's the stalls  That what  I don't know  Oh my goodness  There's a foot of space  Between the stall and the floor  Were you hammered  Because you  Completely  Snotted  No discretion there at all  Hammered  You just decided  I didn't care if any ladies walk in  And see her on her knees  And  Do I have to explain to you  What happens when you get drunk  You think stupid  You think stupid 
[00:29:00]  Like ah  No one's gonna notice  So there was just  An incredible amount of traffic  Now they're trying to figure out  Who's in there  And  All of a sudden  My hairy  Red legs  Uh oh  Were visible  Gave you up  So all of a sudden  They're like  Well his legs are hairy  And they're red  That's red hair  Hey look at that bit  So all of a sudden  Bob Buckman's lovely  And beautiful wife  Screams  Oh my god  It's Opie  Like you're committing a crime

I never even knew that I had a line  Y'all gave me a line  And crossed it by like a mile, man  Oh, I thought we were moving on  I hope we made the analogy yesterday  About, you know  Y'all being the females  And us being the boyfriends  And y'all betrayers  It's not a fact that y'all  Not giving good hummers no more  It's the fact that y'all cheated on me, man 
[00:43:30]  It's ridiculous  I love y'all so much  I am so bitter to both of y'all right now, man  That it's ridiculous, man  This is what's weird about doing a radio show  That we do, Ant and I  You know, we're always pushing things  To the limit, to the edge  And most people are with us  They're like right behind us  Like, okay, all right  This is all right  And then all of a sudden  You go a little too far  And you look behind you  And you go, whoa  Hey, a bunch of our listeners  Just fell off the cliff  Where'd they go?  We didn't know they were going to  Fall off the cliff  I thought they were with us  Where'd they go?  You turn around 
[00:44:00]  Hey, how was that, guys?  Hey, got  Yeah, wait  I didn't know there was a hole  In the ground there  Where'd you go?  Where'd you go?  You know?  Chris  You gotta relax  Chris  Right?  You don't know  All right, let me go to town  You gotta relax  God, we had a good start  To the show today, too  We had some cute little stories  Oh, I thought we were moving on  Nice interaction between you and I  You know?  Moving on  Couple laughs in there  Moving on some laughs  We abused a couple people  But it wasn't  But it wasn't too bad  Oh, I don't know  We looked back  And people were still there 
[00:44:30]  Like, okay, I'm with you  That was a cute little radio chick jab  That was nice, okay  Very funny  I'm with you there  That's all right  Hey  A little local reference  Hey, did a few local references  Made the old gang at BAB  All happy that we're talking about BAB today  Gee, what happened?  Sally  What's up, Sally?  Yeah, hi  I'm really pissed off  At you and Rick  For taking Patty's wig  I think that you should redeem yourself  And apologize to Patty  On the air  That all of us Patty fans  Can get beyond this 
[00:45:00]  All right  You know, Sally  I'll sit back and watch  I, Opie, will be apologizing  At 5.20 this afternoon  Oh, ho  Sally, I know I screwed up  What do you want from me?  You should apologize to Patty  On the air  Water doodle there  We never thought that she would react like she did  Apologize  You knew she was upset  She said, no, I don't want you to take the wig  And then you guys did it anyway  You, Opie, were like forcing Rick to do it  You said, take the wig and run, Rick  Or I'll do it  Or whatever  Something snapped in my head 
[00:45:30]  See, I'm nice and happy again today  You need to apologize, man  Sally, you ever walk into the ladies' room  And have a guy in one of the stalls?  Trying, Opie  Oh, no, not yet  No, Sally, I know I'm in a deep-ass bucket  We like putting people in the bucket  In the barrel  I'm in a really big, deep barrel today  And I'm going to try to work  As well you deserve it  I'm going to try to work my way out  I don't know  I don't know what to say  I don't know what to do  I know after the fact 
[00:46:00]  It was an awful thing  But when we were all going through it  And when everyone else bailed on me  I should have known  I should have known  Patty was fine, Sally  I saw her last night  Whatever  I think Opie needs to apologize  And I want Patty to know  That she's got fans  No matter what people she's in life  The same people that were just bashing her  And saying, get her off, kill her  We heard all kinds of stuff over four years  Hey, Sally, where do you live?  Boston  Boston  Do you have room for Patty? 
[00:46:30]  No, I live in a one-bedroom  But, you know  I wish her all the best luck  I understand why you guys wanted her gone  But I think the wig went way over the top  Sally, big fan of Patty, right?  I like Patty, yeah  I like her voice  I like Anthony's imitation  You got a little corner in your apartment for her?  No, I don't  Why not?  I don't know, I just don't  Well, why?  You gotta help her out  There's no room  There's no room  And she doesn't want to move to Boston  You're a big fan of hers  Why don't you help her out?  I just want to hear an apology to Patty on the air 
[00:47:00]  Then I'll feel better about you guys  So you can feel good about yourself  Yeah  But if you really want to do something nice  Why don't you, you know  Invite Patty to live with you for a while  So you can use a place  No, I think maybe some listeners  We should get some money together  And send her a wig  Alright  Alright, I'll hear your apology  Norton rules  I guess I gotta apologize  So Sally feels better about herself  Yeah  I don't know  People are a little oversensitive  Don't worry about it  I understand where they're coming from 
[00:47:30]  Oh, she's fine  But even that wasn't harsh enough  Because Ant started the show  By saying he saw her last night  She's still got  No matter how harsh it seemed  That's the first opportunity  To hang out with the ONA show  And the ONA listeners  She was there  Right  So it's not like anything's changed  She's been in the barrel before  Everyone, when they get in the barrel  Has their unique way  That people abuse them in that barrel  We've all been there  That's hers 
[00:48:00]  That's the way she goes in the barrel  Part of this program  So what the hell else do you want?  Enough  Charlie, what's going on?  What's up, dude?  Hey, man  Hey, Charlie  Hey, the moulion got busted today  Mark Kelly got caught  21 counts of child pornography  Like Anthony does  Hey, Charlie  What's your ethnic background?  Me?  I'm Irish and American Indian  I'm married to a guinea, though 
[00:48:30]  You sound like one  You're Irish and an American Indian?  Yeah  Dude, how much do you drink?  Well, me?  I'm going to the bar right now  I just got off work  You must drink a lot of Guinness  And a lot of whiskey  I stopped drinking  Since they invented the funnel  Oh, man  That's a wicked combination  Right there  Everyone knows that they each drink a lot  So, Charlie  Wow, that's a shame  Yeah, but we don't rape youngsters  Well, R. Kelly 
[00:49:00]  Yes, 21 counts of child pornography  This guy is effed  Did they confirm who that was on the tape  And that it was underage girls?  It's all breaking news right now  They all  Yeah  They have definitely indicted R. Kelly  They all came forward  21 counts of child pornography  I'll tell you something  I just do not understand people  That videotape themselves, first of all  With anybody  Secondly, if you're going to be  Banging underage girls  What possesses you 
[00:49:30]  To pop a tape  Think this is a Kodak moment  This is a time I should pop a tape  In the camcorder  And let her rip  I don't think you should ever  Tape yourself having sex  No  Even if you think you're in a  Rock-solid relationship  No, no  Because you know something  At some point  That goddamn thing  Is going to get lost  How many videotapes  Have you made in your life  Of events  Holidays  Whatever  Rick  There's been probably a few, right?  Tons  Since the advent of the camcorder  How many  Holiday events 
[00:50:00]  How many  Opie  You got some at home  I know I had plenty  Comedy shows  And band events  And holidays  How many do you still have?  Yeah  A handful  Where'd they go  I don't know  I don't know  See  I don't know  You just don't know  Videotapes disappear  And you start taping yourself  Banging on them  And you don't know  Which tape is what  Yeah  Oh, I thought this was the holiday  Right  This is my banging tape  Where's the  I thought this was the banging tape 
[00:50:30]  It's  No, it's  Wait a minute  I just lent this tape to my sister-in-law  I thought it was Spy TV  From the other night  It's the nephews christening on this one  But where's the  Where's the one  Where I was just  Violating this chick's A  Where is that tape?  And you know what?  It's somewhere  Just sitting  Waiting for someone  To pop it in a VCR  And see your hairy white ass  Banging somebody  And I gotta interrupt you again  Wow  Dennis, go ahead  Hey Opie, man  Let me tell you something 
[00:51:00]  I think you're an effing tool  For telling people  Oh, do you have a place  For Patty to live?  This ain't about us, man  This is about you being an idiot  And treating people  With some kind of respect  Idiot  Well, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan  Dennis, can I tell you  The reality of the situation  And this is the reality  Of the situation  And it's just a matter of time  Anthony and I  Will continue  Supporting Patty  And giving her a life  And giving her a roof over her head  And giving her money  Every time she shows up here  When we see her outside  Here, Patty  Here's another 20 bucks 
[00:51:30]  Here's another 50 bucks  The reality is  She's not going anywhere  She will be back  I don't think that  She's asking for money  And all  She's just asking for  A little bit of self-respect  Dennis, stop it  And the people  Like us  That are listening  Dennis, Dennis  I'm not going to allow you  To say that  Because that is not the truth  You don't know  She's never wanted that  Well, it breaks my heart  You know how much  You know how much  You know how much abuse  We gave her over the years  Yeah, I know  And I don't  She's not looking for that  I don't think that that's right 
[00:52:00]  And, you know  To have that poor girl  Screaming  You know  Because she's out  In the middle of town  And you rip her friggin' hair off  That's ridiculous  Dennis, you know  As far as our show goes  I thought it was in line  And I just didn't  I didn't think  She was going to react like that  None of us around here  Thought she was going to react like that  I just decided  I decided at that point  You know  It was too late  I might as well go with it  But that's fine  I apologize for it  That you feel bad now  But don't throw it on people  Oh, do you have a place  For her to live?  It's not our responsibility 
[00:52:30]  Why not?  Why not?  Stand up and apologize  Why not?  Why not?  You're a part of this show  You're a part of this show  Right, right  And I give her respect  We've always said  You guys are a part of this show  I give her respect  Can I tell you something  Dennis?  We said it yesterday too  There's a lot of listeners  That have spilled out their love  And support to Patty  She doesn't want any of it  For whatever reason  We have found places  For Patty to live  With listeners  Listeners giving up  Parts of their homes  Patty will not live with them  Because it's too far  From the radio station  Right 
[00:53:00]  So what do you want us to do now?  Do you want us to find  A psych hospital for this girl?  No, what I'm saying is  You stand up  And you say  I'm sorry for going too far  Don't throw it on a listener  That's all I want to say  I'm not throwing it on a listener  But you know  That girl from Boston  She's showing all this concern  Well, what does she want to do  For Patty?  That's all  There you go  Hello?  He hung up  He hung up again  The reality is  You know  I mean  I guess that's why  People are so upset 
[00:53:30]  That they thought  That was the end of Patty  She never goes away  For good  Enough  She never goes away  For good  This is what she does  This is how  She is a character  On this program  Deal with it  Did I take it too far?  Duh  Of course  But you know what?  In the end  It's not even going to affect her  In her life  Why don't you call up  Like a TV show?  Next time you see a rerun  Of Seinfeld  Call up and complain 
[00:54:00]  How Jerry treats  Treats his neighbors  Oh, you want to go  With that angle?  This is showbiz  I like that one  This is showbiz  I'm not saying  It's not real people  What I'm saying  Is this is what  She does on this program  And she does very well  With a life  Friends that she has gotten  From this show  Homes that she's gotten  Money that she's gotten  A life that she's gotten  And in exchange  She knows  She knows  That she contributes 
[00:54:30]  Something to this program  And you know what?  She got another  906 bucks Saturday  Yeah  She  I hate to say this  It'll probably get  People even more pissed at me  She plays the pathetic card  All the time  There were people  Handing her money  At the softball game  Like crazy  Because they feel guilty  You know?  Yeah  So enough  Go ahead Dave  Hey guys 
[00:55:00]  How you doing today?  Alright  Hey listen  Opie  I'll lose all respect  For you  If you apologize  To her  And secondly  I think you guys  Went to great  Great lengths  To avoid buying  Dr. Patty  A birthday present  Oh is that  You're good  One more  I think you guys  Should call her  Cockroach Patty  Alright  She's always around  You got us  Thank you  Here's another guy  Here's another guy  Real fast  We want to move on 
[00:55:30]  To other things today  George  Go ahead  Yeah  How you doing  O&A  Hold on  We got people  Calling in  About what happened  To them  When they tape  Themselves having sex  I know  That's all the stuff  We want to hear  Today  Oh yeah  That story  Rape thing  I'll tell you  If you do  An underage girl  And tape it  You can never  Ever  You know  Go so far  As to say  Oh that was  So many years ago  You can't charge me  For it  Right  Yeah  Anyway  Stalker Patty  I'm married  I have children  If she's willing  To do chores  I'll let her live here  George  All right  Paul Ingalls  George  Where do you live  I live in Staten Island  20 minutes from the station 
[00:56:00]  Well George  You know what  I'll put you  I'll put you on hold  And I'm totally  Hold on  Hold on  Because you know what  Look I deserve a lot  Of the email  And the hate  And all that  I understand all that  But maybe you guys  Need to understand  The rest of this story  What I'm going to do  George  I'm going to put you on hold  We're going to take your name  And number  And your address  Just like probably  How many listeners  Close to 100 at this point  And she won't take  Any of them  My wife will drive her  To the station  Anytime she wants  As long as she performs  The little duties  Around the house  My wife needs help 
[00:56:30]  She will not take  Any of these offers  Can I express my opinion  No  And how much you want to bet  She'll be sleeping  On that couch  Or under the stairs  Because that's what  She wants to do  Within a week  I have beautiful  Accommodations for her  Like spots  She won't take your offer  I'm telling you  I understand  But I want to put it out there  For her  But I also want to express  My opinion  Do you realize  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  I'm going to let you  Hold on  And do you realize  Listeners have also  Offered her many many jobs 
[00:57:00]  That pay very well  But she'd rather work  Part time at McDonald's  Because it's a block  And a half from the station  So she can be here  She could be at the station  Anytime my wife  Would let her use the car  But anyway  I wanted to let you know  How I felt about what happened  Bro you make people laugh  For many years now  Right  Laugh  Yes  One time you do something  That some people don't like  And you're going to get asked  About it for how long now  I know enough  A long time  Had it  Get over it  A-holes  Let be let be  That's why you listen to the show  Because you never know  When it's going to go wrong 
[00:57:30]  I mean that's the reality  Of this program  It's not all that  That all  That all cushy  Nice radio  Yeah every now and again  You hit a road bump  Get over it  All that safe radio  Listen to this email  This is somebody  That knows Patty  Knows Patty  Has dealt with her  I'm sorry that Patty  Is beyond the point of help  That any of us  Can provide to her  But that is it  She has no sense  Of priorities  Or responsibilities  I have offered her  A place to stay  A job  Help to get medical insurance  And state aid 
[00:58:00]  And she won't take me up  On my offer  Because in her own words  I'm sorry  But it's too far  From the studio  She's almost 50 years old  And she doesn't have  A pot to whiz in  Or a window  To throw it at her  She won't take me up  Or anyone else up  On their offer  Because it is too far  From Opie  Or the Opie and Anthony show  Well I know  You know in this situation  Me  It's Opie  Because she's always  Had this weird thing  For me for whatever reason  And then she just writes  F it  And this is somebody 
[00:58:30]  And that's why  And that's why  I hate that I have to  Explain myself  On this stupid show  But that's why  Yeah I went for the jugular  I'm  You know  What's next  This is the girl  I was talking about  The other day though  Jen  She was the one  That has offered  Just about everything  To this  To Patty  And Patty won't  Take any of it  Yeah  And then she's  Going to be strutting  Down the hall  Within a week or two  And everyone's  Going to be like  Oh  Right  Don't worry  And all you guys 
[00:59:00]  You can feel good  About yourselves  Because she's back  That's enough  That's enough  Oh my god  American Werewolf  In London  Michael what's up  Hey  I got it  Michael  Who is everybody  Mother Teresa  Out there  It's ridiculous  If you listen to the show  You know this girl's been  Stalking you from day one  Well I  I don't  I don't think  Thanks Anthony  Appreciate that  And do you know something  You should have ripped into  Norton yesterday  I didn't call it  I don't think the new cities  Realize that  She also figured out 
[00:59:30]  What trains I take  And the next thing  She's got two arms  And two legs  She can work  Anywhere she wants to  Next thing  This is one thing  That happened  She started just  Taking the same  Subways as me  You know she has  Two college degrees  Yeah I mean  She's an intelligent girl  Thing is  She's just  Infatuated with you  She used to  Because this hasn't happened  Because I had to yell at her  This was off the air  We didn't put this on the air  It would have been a little  Too harsh for you guys  But I finally had to say  Look Patty  Stop following me  To Penn Station  Every night  What kills me  Is the amount of days 
[01:00:00]  That all these people  Have all of a sudden  Everybody has a conscience  They'll sit after the show  You know  It's all in fun  It was funny  Because I would walk down  On my platform  And there she is  And you know  You give a person one  Like oh  What are you doing  Oh I'm going over here  To blah blah blah  Drink  And then after two weeks  Straight of this  You're like okay  This is a pattern  What the F is this about  Yeah  Next thing you know  She's taking the subway  All the way down  To Macy's there  You know  And then you have to walk  A couple blocks  To Penn Station  And now she's walking me  To Penn Station every day 
[01:00:30]  Yeah  Yeah but  None of this is on the radio  Okay  You see her first thing  In the morning  When you get your breakfast  I remember that  From a long time ago  Which blew me away  And all of a sudden  Norton is all high and mighty  Going oh  Well you know  And Michael  The other thing  Ben picked up on this  There was another pattern  We were doing around here  For a while  We were having breakfast  At the Brooklyn Diner  Every day  Next thing you know  She's sitting at the  At the bar area  They're having  Like a bagel  And a cup of coffee  She doesn't have 
[01:01:00]  She doesn't have money  To buy breakfast  But not at the Brooklyn Diner  I mean the food great  But the price is just  Flat out ridiculous  Down there  Yeah  And next thing you know  She's now having breakfast  With us every day  Yeah but what I'm telling you  Is you have to be  Frosty with her  You understand  You gotta sit there  And give her the  Cold shoulder  Bottom line  Even though you do that  And what you're saying now  She's gonna be back  She without a doubt  Will be back  And you know  Anthony I had more confidence  Of you to be a little bit  Frosty as well 
[01:01:30]  But you bailed early  Anthony did what he had to do  Look dude  It got harsh  Believe me  I know  I know it got harsh  For how harsh it was  She's still  Coming to  A day later  She was at bar nine  She was at bar nine  Last night  Yeah  And our listeners  Are all sitting there  Wishing her a happy birthday  You're right  These same listeners  You know  Whatever  You guys do what you gotta do  But these same listeners  That hated her  Only three days earlier  I know  No they all want to feel  They all want to feel good  About themselves  Whatever  What I would do  Not even take the phone calls 
[01:02:00]  Anymore  Because it's repetitive  It's all  Oh you did this  And oh I did that  And you know  You're absolutely right  These people are so giving  They're all moving to your house  Alright  Alright  Love the new show  On Comedy Central  Crank Angus Florentine  Thanks a lot boys  Yeah give it all in  Yeah great  Talk to you later  Hey oh by the way  When is he gonna admit  It's Florentine  It sounds like Jim Florentine  Our old pal  Of course  Did anybody mention to you  That Patty also found out  About your brother's new job  Or something like that  Oh my god 
[01:02:30]  She gets into everybody's lives  Everybody's lives  No she  Well she's now stalking  My brother's as well  Right  My brother works at a really  Nice restaurant  On Long Island  And what was it  She wanted the address  To send him a card  Or something  Right right right  She wants the address  Where he lives  So she can send him a card  And she wants to go there  For dinner  Right  You know  Thanks  You support the show  But you know  Please stay out of my effing life  Oh well  We don't ask much  We put a lot of ourselves  Out there  The good  The bad  Come on  Yeah you know 
[01:03:00]  We put ourselves  Out there  We put a lot of our  Personalities out there  It's not always the good  Side of our personalities  We're all a mixture  Of a lot of crazy crap  And you know what  This is one show  Where we just throw it  All out there  Right  Sometimes it's real ugly  Bipolar radio  Oh my god  I want to get back  To the banging on tape  Conversation  We got to look at  Some of the calls  This guy taped himself  Banging chicks  Then he sells it 
[01:03:30]  On the internet  Alright well  That's insanity  And I have a great  Bathroom sex story  About my roommate  Who wrote this  Ben  Ben going to contribute  To the show  I also have  A story  That I can contribute  I'll put myself  Out there  As Opius put it  Of a photograph  Or two  Of my naked stepmother  From out in California  Are we allowed  To talk about  Yeah because my  Father's dead  And she's out in California  Alright  We don't 
[01:04:00]  We don't broadcast  Out there yet  This isn't going to  Lead to a death threat  From your own  Family members  Is it  No  No  We're not talking  About cringe moments  It's the complete  Other side  Can I say that part  That is a cringe moment  I think I can say  This is much  We did this thing  That didn't go  It didn't go over  So well  With Anthony's family  Another  Yeah  Another time  In the ONA history  Where we went  Way too far  This time  It was  It was  You know  Aunt messing  With his own family  He didn't know  At the time  I have my own  Mommy on the phone 
[01:04:30]  My own mother  On the phone crying  So we did  It was wonderful  We did this bit  Aunt's mom  Gets on the phone  Just crying her eyes out  And then Aunt's stepfather  Who's really close to Aunt  And all of us  I love Sal  Not only was pissed  But threatened Aunt's life  Live on this show  Live on this show  And he meant it  It happened  And I've been to  A couple of  A couple of weddings  In Aunt's family  And trust me  The guy could get  The job done  He's a retired union  Organizer  Well that's not 
[01:05:00]  Really  You know what I'm saying  I really didn't want  To piss him off at all  But he wasn't the one  I was worried about  You got uncles  That I'm surprised  That they weren't  On the front page  Of the post today  I don't know anybody  In the Gambino family  Stop it  I don't know a Gotti  They pretty much  Rested everyone  With the last name  Gotti  Yeah  Everyone with a  Last name that  Sounds like Gotti  Overnight  And I'm just surprised  That all your relatives 
[01:05:30]  Skated  That's all I'm saying  Hey  I went to a wedding  Once man  I was the whitest guy  In there by far  What?  They're nice people  Loving family I have  I love them all  They were looking at me  In a weird way  Because I was eating  Too much shrimp  What?  No  I'm like  I'm just concerned  For your health  And safety  That's all  Oh God  You want to talk  Old school  Maybe someone like  Uncle Jakey 
[01:06:00]  Who was a second story man  But you know  Nowadays it's slowed down  A little  But another example  Of us taking it too far  We don't know  We don't know  Where the line is  We keep telling you guys  My mom was pissed  And Sal was livid  You think my mom's happy  When I talk about her  Her nightmare of a mother  I can't even talk about  You know  How my mother gets all goosebumps  When she goes  Da da da da da  You know  Things like that  I'm kidding mommy 
[01:06:30]  I love you  See we could all be pals again  Right?  Of course  Right guys?  That's all  That's all we're trying to say  If you think about it  Really  So R. Kelly  21 counts of  Child pornography  Ouch  He's going to find out  That  Jailbirds can't fly  Oh  God 
[01:07:00]  There you go  That was pretty good  Watch out  Watch  Watch out  Watch out  Watch how  Watch how many  Morning zoos  Use that as a serious joke  Of course  He's not in custody  Though by the way  And the people that  Would you be?  Yeah  I know  He was having an affair  With a 14 year old  Daughter of an associate  The girl and the parents  Deny the allegations  So they might have  A tough time  Proving all this  I think 
[01:07:30]  I also heard that  Maybe some payments  Were made to certain people  You know  But this is a guy  Who married Aaliyah  When she was how old?  16  She was underage  Is what she was  And then her family  Got it annulled  You know  So this guy's into  What they call  The chicken  Likes the little chicken  Yeah  A booker  Yes  But to tape it  I mean  That  That's ridiculous  You know  You learn from  Old Tricky Dick Nixon  You don't tape stop  When you're committing crimes 
[01:08:00]  Yeah  Can we get back to that  About  Not taping things  I'm banging  14 year olds  And it's on video  John  What's going on?  Hey  What's up guys?  Hey  Yeah I just wanted to say  That if people think  That you went too far  If Patty's back  Then you didn't go far enough  I mean  That's the fact of the matter  You were trying to get her  To move on with her life  That's what you were  Attempting to do  I mean  It's just ridiculous  That she's  That she's come back  And you didn't go far enough  Well  Oh my god 
[01:08:30]  Cole  Brewer's here  Ah  Brewer  Well John  What's happening man  When it went down  You know  When I was talking about  Like tough love and stuff  That part I truly meant  But you'll find out  For yourselves  That  That  It didn't do any good  Did nothing  Oh no  That's why  Everyone says  You went too far  It's just  You didn't go far enough  And has already seen her  Out and about  And  I wouldn't be surprised  If she showed  And I'm not saying this  For a radio bit  But I wouldn't be surprised  If  You know 
[01:09:00]  If she showed up today  I wouldn't either  She's  She's absolutely  You should have heard her  Last night  I like  Everybody sang  Happy birthday to her  In the club  And  She's fine  Oh  Talking about  It's nice  Stalker Patty  She's all  Yeah  Everyone's in a tizzy  Brewer  Everyone's in a tizzy  Major walk it off  Hold on  Right  He could go off  On a 40 minute tangent  Yeah  Dude let me take a break  That's so annoying  Let me take a break

[01:51:30]  UFO sightings  If I could read  This press release  Hey hey hey  Don't judge  Don't judge  Right  I'm the spaceship man  Stoners  Start getting out  Wesley Pudge  Here it is  His press release  They're here  UFO sighting alert  New York  Listen to the man  One month ago  The amazing Kreskin  Issued a statement  Regarding the largest  UFO sighting 
[01:52:00]  Ever recorded  To TV, radio, and news media  Throughout North America  In his statement  Not only did the amazing  Kreskin predict  This fantastic event  He also  Forecasted the location  Of the sightings  As being  The Nevada desert  Sometime in May  Or June  Of 2002  Although Kreskin  First made this prediction  While on tour in Canada  In March of 2002  It was not until April 2002  That he formally issued  A statement  So sure is he  Of his ability  To predict the future events  With incredible accuracy 
[01:52:30]  He is willing  To back the prediction  With an understanding  Of turning over to charity  $50,000  Should this prediction fail  Since releasing his statement  Kreskin has received  World wide attention  Okay here it is  Is he off the  Yeah yeah  Okay don't pick Kreskin  Up right now  Because we don't want him  Hearing this  I just feel bad  For Kreskin  Since releasing his statement  Kreskin has received  World wide attention  Just like the time 
[01:53:00]  He came in  And did that  Asama Bin Laden thing  And said I got to  Run outside  Because the media  Is waiting to  Interview me  And he had his  TV makeup on  And there was  No way outside  Dude this guy  Gets no attention  From the media  He has not  Now I got a whole  New perspective  Since he had  Makeup on  Now I got a whole  He put makeup on  Because we're like  Why do you have  Makeup on  I said Kreskin  It's radio  Why do you have  Makeup on  He goes  After this  There's going to be  So much press  Outside  That is going to  Want to interview  Me Kreskin  That I have to  Put the makeup on  To meet with the  News crews 
[01:53:30]  And he did some  Like I don't know  What amounted to  A card trick  I didn't even know  Like what he thought  Was going to happen  He thought he was  Really breaking  Osama Bin Laden's  Neck or leg  Or something  And he fell down  And we thought  We didn't know  It was part of  The trick or whatever  We thought he was  Having a stroke  He actually  Yeah to make it  All dramatic  When a pin was  Placed in this  Voodoo doll's leg  He fell down  So we're like  Oh my god  Kreskin are you okay  He's like yes  I'm feeling  His glasses went  Flying and everything  And we're like  Oh it's part of  The gag I guess  His hair flew up 
[01:54:00]  Get up  Like Arba Dwyer  When he shot  Himself in the head  His hair went  There's a clip of  His glasses came off  Up on Foundry  I think  It was  Amazing  Ridiculous  It was amazing  Amazing Kreskin  It was amazing  To watch him fall down  And lose his glasses  And my shoes fell off  So did I have them  I have them  I can't see  God damn it  Kreskin's getting impatient  On the phone  Oh okay  Hold on  Hold on  Since releasing a statement  Worldwide attention  Inquiries regarding this event  Pouring in daily  It says  Because of the staggering  Number of inquiries  On this matter

I don't know  I'm just hanging  Just hanging out  Aren't you past  That residual year  Where they start  Like making it a law?  Yeah, I think  I'm into the law zone 
[02:33:30]  So  He once bought  A car  For his girlfriend  In lieu of a wedding ring  Knowing it would be cheaper  Hey, that's a great idea  Knowing it would be cheaper  It was cheaper  You know, when I got a divorce  People are like, oh yes  How much money do you make?  No, it was cheaper  When I got a divorce  My wife took all of my cars  She got the houses  The cars  And I got  Mafia car  Yeah, I never said  What kind of car it was  Yeah, my car's parked  In a mafia dude's driveway  In Philadelphia  I'm hiding from the feds  My license is expired  My insurance is expired  I owe John Elway

And they're looking for me  They call so many times  They quit calling  I used to call them back  And leave messages  Like they would leave me  30 messages a day  I would leave the messages  At 4 in the morning  For them  Right  That way you know  No one's going to be there  How come you can't find me?  What's the problem?  What's going on?  I'm making an effort  That's a great trick  I'm making an effort  How can you not know  Where I am  When I leave  Like phone ads  The only advertising  I get here at NAW  Is on my cell phone  It's O&A  And my cell phone  I do a running sportscast 
[02:34:30]  On my cell phone  Every day  You should call it  Where I just do  The sports news of the day  In like 5 seconds  And a bit of  Gambling advice  I gamble heavily  I'm going to the Belmont States  On Saturday  Friday  And the second thing is  Is that I'm going up there  I've never heard of that place  It's somewhere  And the second place is  I'm going  Your body mouth  Wow slow down  The second I'm going to the Belmont  To  Let your brain catch up  To wear a suit  And gamble heavily 
[02:35:00]  Yeah  I'm going to bet on  Every single race  Even horses I've never heard of  I'm going to bet on  The grey horse  Do you wheel the stuff  And all that man  I affect that  I do  I got a hot girlfriend  With big rack  And I'm wearing  Just massive  I'm going to wear  A green suit  I'm going to have a straw  How much time  How much time  Have you spent  In OTBs and what not  You ever go that route  Well the best part  Is when you're  Like fingernail chewing  In Fort Collins  They got one  With the old men  With hats  And they're on there  And they're jonesing 
[02:35:30]  And they drink  Scotch rocks  And they're just  You know  And you're betting  On horses  And you didn't even know  There was a track  Within a thousand miles  Of Denver  And I'm in  The foothills  Of the Rockies  I'm in some place  Eating a hamburger  And everybody's shaking  And the waitresses  Come out  And they're trying  To hold the tray  It's exciting man  I used to work  Right next to a bar  We'd take our lunch  At eleven o'clock  We would not get back  To work until two  And we'd just bet  On the horses  Because the OTB  Was next time  And you'd get  The old guys  That are like  I had the A 
[02:36:00]  With the C  With the E  I needed the B  With the A  With the D  But look how close  I came with this one  I got the D  With the A  And they rip  Every ticket up  And they never hit  Every time you go  To a track  I hang out  I glue  Speaking of glue  The horses  I go right to the old men  I go to the old men  I hang  I hang with old men  And I hang with old men  And they know  The horses  And typically  Like with the dogs  Like when I lived  In Sarasota  They have the dogs  And down in Tampa  They have great dog racing 
[02:36:30]  And the key is  When they bring the dogs  Past you  Before the race  They prance them past you  The dog that has dumped  The soonest  Before the race  Right  That's what they say  Yeah  Is the dog  A little lighter  So what we would do  Is plant like Mexican dudes  Down by the dog track  To find out  Which dog cabled last  And we pay the dude  20 bucks  And he'd give us  He'd give us all the races  With the dogs  The crap report  It's basically  The cable report  The crap report  That's nice  And it was  We did a gig once  At the dog track  They wanted to kill us 
[02:37:00]  Remember  Oh  Isn't that  What all the protesters  They get that  What the dog track  Reminds me of  Is you guys  Treating stalker Patty  With her wig  You know how  That little rabbit  Goes around  And the dogs  Chase the rabbit  You guys  With her wig  Is like her  But that dude  Her do  When you said  Leave the straw thing  On the back  Yeah yeah  I wanted to leave  Like a little skullet  In the back  That was evil man  It was  But she had that removed  I've had phone calls  About you today  Of course  People hate  They're just vicious  It's undeniably despicable 
[02:37:30]  I will not associate  With you  If this is the company  You're keeping  And you and those  Happy hours  Have got to stop  All I know  Is I peeled off  220 bucks  And put in our hand  In the dugout  On a Saturday  And I'm getting crucified  For why  You pull a wig  Off our head  We're working  Our way out of it  They told me  That I called  Too many people  Whores on Saturday  But I thought  You did great  Really fast  The Tyson fight  What are you thinking  It's real simple 
[02:38:00]  Mike hasn't beaten anyone  Or fought anyone  In over a decade  The last guy  I mean he was fighting  The pizza delivery guy  Peter McNeely  And this way  Sum it up this way  Lewis has not done  One interview  Not been seen  Not been noticed  Has been oblivious  To everyone  Stand in a mansion  Outside of Memphis  Great barbecue town  Look for the chickadees  In the hotel lobby  And B  There's too many  Black people there  And B  The problem is  Is that Tyson  Spent the whole week  Photo ops 
[02:38:30]  Hugging white bitches  Taking pictures  Hugging the gay guys  His little  You know  Little workouts  With a rope  I can do that too  So Lewis is like  Clubber Lang  He's there in the  Old dirty gym  You know his jab  Is just gonna work  Tyson's face  I'll say this about Tyson though  After watching Holyfield  The other day  I've said it on the air  Holyfield is the dirtiest  Fighter I've ever seen  And when he bit his ear  He deserved it  Because he headbutted him  That night too  Oh my god  Because everybody thinks  Mike's this criminal  And Mike's actually  A tripped out  Whacked out individual  That should be  You know going to meetings 
[02:39:00]  And being institutionalized  But the fact of the matter is  Is that Holyfield's  The dirtiest fighter  I've ever known  He's headbutted everybody  Including John Ruiz  Three times  He put a conjoined twin  On that guy's head  He headbutted him  That's how he wins fights  His only way to win the title  To try to win the title  At age 59  With 62 children  From 59 different whores  Is to headbutt people  So I honestly believe  That Tyson's only chance  Against Lewis  Is to headbutt  Or to low blow  Or to get disqualified  And the only way  For Lewis to blow it  Is to not jab 
[02:39:30]  And not to kill him  With an overhand right  Lewis wins the fight easily  Easily  All right  Scott Farrell  Look for that  Farrell  Morning's right here  On WNEW in New York  Shake it up  Shake it up  I do that in the air  In the morning  It feels good though  Shake it up  We have time to go to Mike  Thanks for the penthouse shirts too  The chicks dig me  Because they know  I like the wet cantaloupe  Come on  Yeah  I love Scott Farrell  Thanks Scott  You got to check him out  In the morning man  Overnight flower party  Cleveland free open bar  With Farrell

[03:15:00]  Yeah  Anthony a lot of people saying  We owe them a  Falling through the ceiling  Story  Ah well  We kind of got off track  Of that  We never got to talk  About the sex tapes  I want to kind of  Talk about that  A lot of people  Had great stories  Well we'll do that as well  But what's going on  With this falling  Through the ceiling  Well it kind of  Started with the  Conversation  Everyone has a bathroom  So it kind of  Started off today  Because we started  The show  I had a story  About bar nine  Last night  I went to  You know 
[03:15:30]  Hang out with my  Brother and Laird  And we were singing  Songs at bar nine  As we do every other  Tuesday at bar nine  And I had to go  To the bathroom  I had to take a dump  And I ended up  Taking one of the ladies  Room and I overheard  A conversation  Between two girls  That came in  When I was in the bathroom  So I had to hide  Kind of make like  I was a girl  In the stall  And it got me  Thinking about a story  Of a friend of mine  Steve Carney  Out there in  Comac, Long Island  We used to hang out  At a bar out there  Called Doubles  Oh yeah  I remember Doubles 
[03:16:00]  Yeah right in Jericho  Turnback  It was right next to  Where we used to work  At True Mechanical  I was about to dive  Oh yeah  It was an OTB bar too  Like there was an OTB  Right next door  So we'd place the bets  And hang out  But at night  It was kind of like  The local hangout  For the neighborhood  That was around the bar  And some hot girls  Used to go in there  And a buddy of mine  Steve Carney  Decided he was going to  Climb through the ceiling  Of the men's room  Which was right next  To the ladies room  And it was a hung ceiling  You know  The acoustic tiles 
[03:16:30]  They're made out of nothing  You know  They break very easily  So he pops up through that  Pulls himself up  And he lifts up  The tile in the girls room  And now he's got  The view of the girls  Stall  And sees the girls  Doing their business  Decides to take a peek  Take a peek  What could it hurt?  It's not going to hurt nothing  Well when the bouncer  Came into the men's room  And sees two legs  Hanging out of the ceiling  And goes to grab them  Steve figures  He's going to get away  So he pulls himself up 
[03:17:00]  And tries to I guess  Get on the wall  The little narrow wall  Between the men's  And the ladies room  He fell off of that one  And fell right through  The ceiling of the ladies room  Was anyone in there?  Yeah  On top of one of the girls  That were in the stall  That he was watching  Imagine you're just  You know how the girls go  Right?  They sit down  And they get that  Yeah it sounds like 
[03:17:30]  You're frying up bacon  You know guys  Got the altitude  You know  And the nice stream  Girls are like  I'll be a minute  Is someone in there?  Call back to 320  Sorry  Awful  So he falls  Quick thinking though  He gets to his feet  Bolts out of the girls room 
[03:18:00]  And runs out of the bar  Thinking no one will know  Who he was  No one really saw his face  Meanwhile he used to hang out  In there all the time anyway  He gets out of the bar  But then decides  He'll just brush himself off a bit  And walk in like  Hey how you doing?  Good night everybody  I just came in  I hadn't been here before  But he had acoustic tile  Fragments  And his hair  Scrape up his arm  And everything  What did the girl do? 
[03:18:30]  Freaked out  Obviously  Girls don't like being looked at  But you know something  He had also been in the  Tin knocking industry  So whenever you're doing that  You realize ways of peeping in  On attractive girls  We did a job once  It was a spa  A whole gym set up  In a hotel  And we noticed that  If you looked over the wall  And picked the tile up  It was the locker room  The ladies locker room  That is like finding gold  It was  And everyone was cool about it 
[03:19:00]  You couldn't all gather around  And make comments  You had to take turns  You had to get someone  To be able to look out  Take turns  Yeah you needed to look out  And then you had to  Get your work done too  Yeah sure  So you couldn't just  Stay up there all day  But you get your peeks  Where you could  That's what it was all about  He just got a little careless  Okay I'm not  Hello  Hello  Anybody there?

[03:38:00]  Of course, you see that on Discovery Channel  They're all flapping, going to the beach  The seagulls get them  One might just turn upside down  It's time for some of these turtles to be sucked up by the seagull  And it seems that whenever we take it upon ourselves to do this, what happens?  We get in trouble  With our own audience  With our audience  So you know something?  And so, you know what?  I think I learned something  I think we need to do it another way  Another way where it is none on us

[03:39:00]  Something entertaining  Something fun  Whatever it is  Just something that the audience might hear and say  All right, they're doing something for the show  You've got to earn your keep  Earn your keep  Because you know what I've noticed?  We have a lot of people that are involved with this program  A lot of these, we call them hangers-on or whatever you want to call them  And we really don't get new ones  Because we have so many of the old ones  Right  Time to thin the herd  And we start with 
[03:39:30]  Lady Di  Lady Di  Lady Di is on the bubble  There you go  She's on the bubble  And she better call back  We're giving her a little over a week  Now we're being fair about it  Because we could just say  All right, audience, what do you think right now?  And quite frankly  They'd probably throw a fat ass out  Right  But we're giving her an opportunity  To think it out  And come up with something  To contribute to this show 
[03:40:00]  And we're going to do this  Once a month  For the rest of the summer  Right  Here it is  The summer weeding  So by the end of the summer  We will lose three of these people  Maybe four  Yeah  We start with Lady Di  Lady Di  So she better call back  Here she is  Anthony, why don't you explain this to her?  Oh, thanks  Lady Di  Yes  Lady Di  Listen very, very closely to Anthony  Okay  Here's the deal  We are what they call thinning the herd  You know what that means? 
[03:40:30]  I heard it on the radio  Yeah  Oh, you've just heard what we said?  Mm-hmm  All right  Well, this concerns you  And you're the first one that's up  Can I ask you one thing before you get into this?  Sure  Lady Di, why do you deserve to be part of this radio show?  Well, I love your show  As we move forward  That's the same thing we heard with Patty  Okay  Love the show  Right  All right  Do you feel you contribute to the show?  Well, sometimes it depends 
[03:41:00]  Mm-hmm  What can you do for the Opie and Anthony show?  Whatever you want me to do  Oh, boy  See  See that  Whatever  Whatever you  I don't know  Whatever you want me to do  What do you want me to do?  Here's the catch  See?  Well, we're going to find out, Lady Di  Anthony, if you will  Lady Di, you are going to have  How much time?  How much time are we going to give her?  Like I said, a week from Friday  A week  A week from Friday?  From this Friday  Listen closely now  Okay  You are from now  Till a week from this Friday  To come up with something 
[03:41:30]  That you will then come on the show  A week from Friday  Okay  And do  Right  Based on what you come up with  And how you pull it off  And how entertaining it is  For this show's audience  Okay  The audience will then vote  Whether to keep you  Or  To boot you  To boot you  Oh, alright  So, you have some thinking to do  Okay  You are not to call us  And ask us if this is good or not 
[03:42:00]  You're not  Well, we'll give her that  Really?  Yeah, because it could be her last week of radio  I just kind of want her to come on  Cold turkey  And just  Do whatever she says she's going to do  I think if she has some questions  She could call  As long as she keeps it short  And doesn't wreck the whole  God damn flow of the radio show  Right  I wouldn't do that  Of course you wouldn't  Oh, stop it  You just did  Take a look in the rearview mirror  I would not do that  And Lady Di  If you choose to just blow this off  And assume that everything will be  Hunky-dory  Hunky-dory 
[03:42:30]  You are mistaken  Sadly mistaken  You will never be on the show again  Oh, no  Don't say that  So  Well, this is  This is how important this is  We go on the show once in a while anyway  You know, we're not there that often  What's this we stuff?  Because I live in New Jersey  We  We don't have to think we anymore  Marion has been very entertaining for this program  People hate her  But Marion and I are your best friend  It doesn't matter  It doesn't matter  I'm sure Tom Cruise has best friends too 
[03:43:00]  Do they end up in his movies?  And I got a best friend  You don't want to hear him on the radio  Tom Cruise  There you go  Quite frankly  How did Tom Cruise fit into this?  Right  You know, we all have our friends  I wasn't even thinking about him  I just hang out with him  I just hang out with him  To make me look funnier  Okay  So Marion has done a great job  Entertaining this program  I have to give her that  In her annoying fashion  Let's do it  Listen, she's got the lisp  She's got the little troll look 
[03:43:30]  It works  You on the other hand  What do I have?  You are kind of  You're like a Marion hanger-on  That is a hanger-on of this show  Well, I've been a hanger-on with Marion  You're a second generation  Hanger-on  Okay, listen  Listen  You're wasting more time  Right  Anthony, say what you have to say  We hang up on Lady Di  And it'll be up to her to figure it out  Lady Di, you have  Until a week from this Friday  To come up with something  That you believe the audience is going to hear  And go, all right  It's worth keeping her around 
[03:44:00]  Is that simple enough?  That's simple enough  Okay  I will do the best I can  It could be anything  Anything  Anything  It could be a stunt  It could be a performance of something  It could be anything that you believe  The audience is going to go  Wow, okay  She's a commodity  Anything goes  It could be drunk, naked, karaoke  There you go  What a naked karaoke?  Oh, shut up  But whatever you come up with  You know what?  It might put you over the top 
[03:44:30]  And it's something that you're going to  Be known for on the show  And listeners are going to look forward  To you coming back  And doing that same thing again  Yeah  Okay  All right  I will try to work on something  And you keep in touch with Rick  Rick will be keeping in touch with you  To see how things are going  Okay, exactly  And we'll get our reports back from Rick  Exactly  And if Rick could come up with something  No  No  No  See, you don't understand the rules  Listen to the rules  I have to come up with this  You must come up with this  Okay 
[03:45:00]  Do you now understand?  Yes, I do  Do you have anything in mind right off the bat?  A couple of things  Like real fast?  No, you don't  Real fast  A couple  Real fast, go  A couple of things  Real fast, go  Oh my goodness  You have nothing  No, no, no  I have a couple of things in mind  I'm just working on them right now  I really, really do  How about you give us one?  One of the things  Let's see  You have nothing 
[03:45:30]  Well, the only thing that comes to mind is shaving  But, you know, that's just about it  Shaving what?  I don't know  I don't know  Oh boy  Oh my goodness  No, no, no  Really, really  I do have a couple of things  I have to think about it  This is kind of quick  And I've got to think about it  Dave has an idea on line three  See?  What?  He thought up something quick  Oh, really?  Let me go to Dave  Yeah, maybe Dave can help you  Go to Dave  Okay, Dave  You got something Lady Di can do?  Yeah, I got something Lady Di can do  What?

Okay, so I will think about it  And I will get back to you  Lady Di, you're on the bubble  You have a little over a week  To figure it all out  I will figure it out  And I will figure it out  It's the Opie and Anthony Survivor game  Uh-huh  Here it is
