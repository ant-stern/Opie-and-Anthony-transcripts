<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts recounting a humorous, albeit disastrous, evening involving network equipment, pretzels, potato chips, firearms, and a partially obscured movie.  This segued into a listener complaint alleging the show incited racist behavior by a mentally challenged man.  The discussion then shifted to a guest's weight loss struggles and their trainer's unusual methods,  interrupted by Jimmy Norton's furious return to the studio.  Norton, visibly angered by the NYPD's inaction on a reported issue despite his past support for them, aired his grievances, leading to several off-air calls with police contacts offering assistance.  The conversation then veered towards an abandoned U-Haul on a bridge, sparking listener speculation. E-Rock's absence was explained by a mayonnaise-eating contest resulting in severe illness, prompting debate over the authenticity of his ailment and his anger towards Sam.  The show concluded this section with a discussion of a British sniper's record-breaking long-range shot, punctuated by listener calls and comedic tangents.

The next segment covered a British sniper's 1.54-mile shot, Carrie's return to work post-partum, and a quickly dismissed caller during the "Unnecessary Cruelty" segment.  The hosts mistakenly claimed it was Kevin Smith's birthday and launched into extended riffing on a weatherman's on-air gaffe ("relatively queer" instead of "relatively clear").  They then discussed the hypocrisy of anti-gay Baptist minister George Reckers and his use of male escort services, detailing the website and his activities graphically.  The BP oil spill's environmental impact and containment efforts were debated, transitioning into a discussion of phobias, particularly the hosts' fear of water and unexpected underwater contact.  This led to a detailed, graphic discussion of noodling, alligator snapping turtles, and other unusual creatures, including Komodo dragons, mud skippers (with graphic descriptions of their mating habits), and various deep-sea life.  A supposedly viral video of a news reporter experiencing diarrhea on air was deemed fake. The segment ended with further discussion of "prehistoric" and disturbing animals.

The following segment began with a picture of a large coconut crab, prompting expressions of disgust and fear.  A video of Steve-O having a coconut crab clamp onto his buttock elicited laughter and shock. The conversation continued with discussions of other unusual and frightening animals, including the aye-aye and alligator gar, interspersed with mockery of the *Piranha 3D* trailer and Richard Dreyfuss's appearance. This was followed by angry and vulgar messages from the "F.U. line."  The hosts then criticized the sexualization of children in beauty pageants like *Toddlers and Tiaras* and *Little Miss Perfect*, discussing a viral video of a young girl in a highly sexualized dance competition.  The discussion moved to Canadian game show host Fergie Oliver and his inappropriate kissing of young female contestants, with listeners providing details.  The segment concluded with a discussion of a viral video featuring a convicted child molester, further commentary on the sexualization of young girls, and a fabricated image of Shirley Temple in Nazi regalia, along with a Crispin Glover poem.  The hosts used frequent vulgar and offensive language throughout.

Two models from Beezid.com were in-studio guests for the next segment,  which devolved into sexually explicit and offensive conversations focusing on their physical attributes and sexual experiences.  Graphic descriptions of a transgender beauty contest they participated in were included.  The hosts repeatedly objectified the models.  The conversation shifted to a phone call with Ian Halpern, a celebrity biographer, who discussed his work, including unauthorized biographies and blind items involving sexually explicit allegations about political figures and Princess Diana.  A lengthy digression about Anthony Cumia's naked neighbor led to discussion of potential legal action.  The segment was highly inappropriate and sexually charged, with frequent offensive language and sexually explicit descriptions.  Halpern promoted his upcoming Michael Jackson documentary.

The final segment focused heavily on the strained relationships several staff members had with their mothers.  The primary focus was on Travis, whose mother left him and his brother to marry a Jewish man, severing contact with her family. The hosts and staff, including Danny, shared their own complex relationships with their mothers, using vulgar and offensive language.  Graphic and sexually explicit jokes regarding Travis's mother's motivations and her new relationship dominated a significant portion.  A voicemail from Danny's mother, highly critical and insulting, was played.  The call letters of Travis's father's radio station were guessed at, prompting further jokes.  The segment concluded with a promotion for the Opie and Anthony Internship Program featuring further vulgar and unprofessional interaction between Sam Roberts and another staff member.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I pride myself on my lack of blinking.  Have you ever bought anything involving a computer that has to hook up to your network and had it work immediately?  Like a router, you mean?  Anything.  Anything that you buy that is a computer or a computer-like device that plugs into your home network and then have it actually work. 
[00:00:30]  Plug and play.  Never in my life has this happened.  Using Windows?  Last night, I was going batshit trying to get something to work.  Can I come over and tweak with it?  I think I could get it to work for you.  No, I don't think you could.  Why?  I could try a few things.  No, I've seen how you fix things.  It's usually with a hammer.  Then I'd finally get the official invite to come over to your house. 
[00:01:00]  You've got the official invite.  The official invite.  Everyone's shaking their head.  I'm just trying to keep the bit going.  That's all.  I understand.  We try to do bits.  I went by.  It was really fun.  I know.  Yeah, now the pool's open.  Oh, the cleaning guy coming today, I think.  Yeah, I know.  It was just me, Jimmy.  Just you with a gun and boots in the kitchen while we ate pretzels and fucking shitty wheat  pretzels and fucking Christmassy potato chips out of a bag. 
[00:01:30]  What do you mean Christmassy?  Just that Christmassy, like that's how old they were.  No, they weren't that old.  Fucking red and green bag.  It was still.  It was awful.  It was still fresh.  Hey, can we have some water or something?  Lukewarm water out of the fucking faucet while he stands there with a weapon.  No, they were bottled water.  Hey, you want to come downstairs and watch a cutoff version of a hit movie?  You can see up to the knee on fucking Kirk.  Fucking shitty night that was. 
[00:02:00]  And I'll pass out, go to acute alcoholism, while you and your broad fucking walk out.  Awkwardly.  And hope you don't jostle me awake where I shoot you in the back.  Fucking you're an intruder.  Fucking horrendous.  That is exactly how the evening went, by the way.  I'm standing there with a fucking plastic jug of wheat pretzel braids.  Wheat pretzel braids fucking digging in and looking for some kind of a beverage.  Fucking hard to find a non-alcoholic beverage in his fridge. 
[00:02:30]  The only reason he has water is because of all the dehydration from drinking.  He has to have water.  Holy shit.  He could not have described better how that evening went.  It was just so awkward.  He was just standing there with a beer in the middle of this fucking castle by himself.  Not a friend to be had.  Just alone.  That's just the other side of this whole thing that not many people get to see.  Oh, it was fucking depressing.  All I hear about is these fucking amazing shindigs at Ann's house.  Oh, you should have been there.  The fucking Danny was there. 
[00:03:00]  The Rockettes came by.  They all took their panties off and rubbed their clits on me.  It's hysterical.  You show up at the one night, no one's there.  It's just you in paramilitary gear alone.  No.  It's fucking awful.  Ann, you invite us over at the worst times because I've been in that situation, too,  where nothing's going on.  I know.  I don't know what it is.  All we hear about.  And then we leave feeling really sorry for you.  There's fucking naked chicks running around.  There's loads being spilled.  Guns are being fucking kicked around and thrown around in alcohol-fueled frenzies. 
[00:03:30]  Keith, the cops having a ball.  And we show up, and it's just him and a bag of Doritos.  Right, because we don't drink, so he invites us in the off hours.  The fuck?  Then we drive home feeling really depressed for you.  Holy shit.  The O.B. and Anthony Show starts now.  Previously on O&A.  Hand trucks of those big brown lawyer boxes that hold all those big brown envelopes and  pulling a whack, whack, whack on the table.  Just wham, wham, these piles of files. 
[00:04:00]  I'm looking at them going, what could that possibly be?  I bet that's intimidation half of that.  Oh, it's like blank sheets and shit like that.  And you're a lawyer?  One piece of paper.  He'll come folded and crumpled out of his pocket.  With just handwritten notes on it.  With a broken pencil.  You got a sharpener, Your Honor?  No.  Did you have faith in his ability?  No.  People are saying that a mentally challenged man was goaded by the O.B. and Anthony Show 
[00:04:30]  to engage in racist behavior by asking Spanish Americans or Latin Americans to show their  papers while the hosts encouraged him and laughed.  Apparently he's a comedy fodder.  His pants have been pulled off and his penis has been spit on by an Asian American comedian.  What do you fucking want to lose this gig to?  Go home, Bobo.  What was the weight?  2.27.  Oh, 2.27. 
[00:05:00]  Wait, what?  2.27.  Three years ago when you thought he was fatted or needed to lose weight at 2.14, now he's  2.27 there.  2.27?  Yeah.  And he's had a trainer since, I think, Christmas.  Yeah.  Yes.  That was five months ago.  What the fuck is the trainer doing for you?  I went to 2.15.  It's the Ringling Brothers trainer.  He's trying to get him to stand on a box.  All right, yeah.  I'm like an elephant.  Shoving in there.  13 says.  He's making the...  Oh.  Now the faces are a lot different. 
[00:05:30]  He's making the face.  You make them like the first...  Oh.  Wait, wait.  Oh.  Oh, God.  Is he throwing up?  Oh.  Okay.  There he goes.  We have...  We have a winner.  Here.  You're right there.  You're right.  He doesn't look good.  Oh.  Oh.

[00:09:30]  To be continued... 
[00:10:00]  See, kids, smoke your pot, play your video games, and watch TV.  You'll be better off when you get R.A.  There's no ratings here.  No one cares.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, let's do just that.  Yeah, let's do just that.  Yeah, let's do just that.  What happened to Jimmy?  He walked out of the studio just as we're about to start.  He's talking to Kenny.  He's all right?  Talking to Keeney.  What's up, Anthony?  About something. 
[00:10:30]  Trying to get my headphones at a proper level.  Are yours a little low?  Mine are not.  Mine are fucked up.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, it's weird.  Yeah, it's weird.  Like, the music's really loud, but...  How's that?  And the headphone level.  There we go.  How's that?  All right.  That'll work.  What's that shirt?  Oh, I don't know.  No, I'm just trying to...  Oh, this one.  See?  I got this for my birthday from a very special man. 
[00:11:00]  See?  Am I supposed to know this?  Yes.  See?  It says...  Nostromo?  Nostromo.  USCSS Nostromo.  180286 from the Wayland Corporation.  I know it's a movie.  Of course it is.  Which one, though?  The Nostromo?  There's also another ship, the Sulaco. 
[00:11:30]  God damn it.  From the second one, the Sulaco.  You know what?  That's a movie I just gotta re-watch.  I haven't watched that in probably...  Fuck.  Easily 10 years.  You know what that was, though?  That was a...  That was a go-to-sleep movie for me.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  If I was ever trying to go to sleep,  I'd put that on.  Because I'd seen it a million times,  but it was still good to watch,  so I would just watch it and fall asleep.  Ah, fuck.  That's right.  Okay. 
[00:12:00]  Hey, that's a cool shirt then, man.  Oh, look.  You have a Sulaco shirt, too.  Holy shit.  Aliens.  I gotta grab up, like, every Alien shirt that that company makes.  That's fucking cool as shit.  How many times have you seen Aliens?  Aliens?  Not as much as Alien, but really close.  I meant Aliens as the series.  I'm sorry.  Oh, I've seen the first one the most.  The second one is great.  Seeing that not as much, but almost as much.  And then three and four.  I've seen four more than three.  But one and two, you've seen a lot. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, one and two are just mainstays.  That's it.  Easily 20 times?  Yeah.  Really?  Oh, fuck.  Beyond 20 times.  I think the only movie I've seen 20 times would be Caddyshack.  Yeah, yeah.  I think that's probably the only movie I've seen 20 times.  Jimmy is really annoyed.  Jimmy, what happened?  Yikes.  I have just done nothing but back the NYPD.  Right.  I need one thing.  And the patrolman was fine.  And the detectives just fucked me. 
[00:13:00]  Really?  It's a legitimate issue.  And I've been completely supportive of the NYPD.  Blindly so.  And I asked for one thing.  And they just fucking ignore it.  And it's a legitimate issue.  I'm livid.  I can't even, just livid.  Why?  Because they don't want to do their jobs.  That's why.  Jesus.  What happened?  The detectives don't want to do their jobs.  Hmm.  I can't even, I'm just livid.  Sorry. 
[00:13:30]  Jesus.  It's a whole legit thing.  It's not like you're looking for a favor.  Right?  No, I'm kind of needing them to do their jobs.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Sorry, Jimmy.  Ugh.  You're hot.  You're hot under the collar.  Just an asshole.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Hmm. 
[00:14:00]  Thank you.  For nothing.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Whew.  Ugh.  I'm sure someone will call.  Then I got a call.  For what?  For what?  I know cops for 20 years.  One thing I need done, and it's legit.  It's not.  It's, I need somebody to do their job.  Not somebody to do me a favor.  I don't need a ride.  I don't need something fixed.  Somebody to do their job. 
[00:14:30]  And, uh, I found out now for 17 days, they've just, they just closed it up.  They won't, they won't do anything.  They weren't going to do anything.  Ugh.  Jeez.  I'm sorry.  I'm just fucking disgusted.  No other recourse?  Nope. 
[00:15:00]  No.  No, you think, no.  The NYPD, you think, would be the recourse.  Yeah.  We have a fairly good relationship with cops.  Mm-hmm.  And you think they're not doing their jobs?  I know, I know, I know they're not.  I know that.  It's not even though I think, or it's not speculation.  They're not.  Right, right.  And they didn't call me and go, look, this is, just ignored it.  Totally ignored it.  So now what?  Nothing.  Thank you for nothing.  I'm just, I don't mean to stop the show. 
[00:15:30]  I'm just, I cannot hide how angry I am.  No, you're mad.  Just, it's, it's, why?  I know the cops like the show.  It's not about the patrolman.  You know what I mean?  I think I dealt with a patrolman.  It was fine.  It was great.  It was, it's not about the patrolman.  The detectives don't want to do what they're supposed to do.  That's the, that's the bottom line.  Why wouldn't they want to do it? 
[00:16:00]  I don't know why.  I honestly don't, I don't know what their motivation is.  For the same reason, he said, you know, hey, you know, they don't give a fuck.  They don't give a fuck.  They got other things?  Yeah.  And again, I don't expect my life to be on par with the terrorism that's happening.  I'm not an idiot.  But they've been doing nothing before that.  Want to talk to an NYPD cop?  For what?  No, I love the, no, the patrolman, no.  There's nothing to say.  I mean, the patrolman have been very good. 
[00:16:30]  Tom, he's cool with you guys.  I like seeing the patrolman.  Hey, Tom.  So what's going on?  Maybe I could assist you.  It's, it's a long story, buddy, but I got into it.  A patrolman helped me out.  Well, let me ask you a question.  How do you know what their job is to say that they're not doing their job?  Because I, because I know a guy who is a detective who's dealing with them.  Okay.  So that's how I know.  And he advised you that that is something that they are able to do or they should be doing for you?  Yes.  And also I'm 41 and I know that this is an issue that they handle. 
[00:17:00]  Uh-huh.  That's why.  Well, maybe I can help you out if you want to talk about it.  I mean, you're keeping everybody in suspense over here.  No, it's not suspense.  It's just something I can't, it's not, it's not even, it's not even important.  It's just something that's going on that they're not helping me with that they, they should be.  And, uh, again, it's not the patrolman.  It's, there's nothing that the cops that I initially spoke to can do.  I understand.  I mean, the thing is we're always having people rant on us on the radio, TV. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, but you don't have, you don't have me ranting on you.  I'm, I've been supportive of the NYPD completely and I still am.  But the detectives in this case are not doing their job.  So I'm pissed off and I'm saying that I'm pissed off and I'm telling them thanks for nothing.  Well, I, I know you, I know you support it.  That's the only reason why I would call and see if maybe I could, uh, help you out or maybe, uh, you could see things differently.  All right.  Hey, uh, Tom, what happened with that U-Haul truck on the bridge last night?  You know anything?  U-Haul, not anything about that.  Okay.  All right.  We'll, we'll get into the story. 
[00:18:00]  It seems like it's, uh, I don't know what it is.  Some idiot decides to just stop a U-Haul truck and, and, and leave it on the middle, on the entrance to, uh, one of the bridges here in New York.  What was it?  Tribor RFK?  You're stuttering.  Did Jimmy make you nervous?  Yeah.  I get, I get all, I get scared.  I know you do.  I get scared when Jimmy gets all mad.  You get like that no matter who does it.  I get scared.  When I read Rave, you do the same thing.  You get all fucking stuttering. 
[00:18:30]  My stomach hurts.  You get all stuttering.  My tummy hurts now.  It is one of the most well-spoken guys I've ever met in my life.  I bet all you have to do is yell in front of him and he starts stuttering.  Jimmy, it's like Jimmy threw spaghetti against the wall.  I feel, I'm all nervous now.  I have a nervous tummy.  Do you got a sour stomach?  Yeah, I, I can't go to school today.  I don't feel good.  I asked you about the truck and you wanted to hide from the, I don't know how many of you.  I, I, I, I, I.  I'm lucky I know it. 
[00:19:00]  I should have just called a friend of mine who's a detective.  I didn't think of it.  I thought you had to do it in a certain area.  I didn't think to call this guy I know.  Again, I don't like calling, you know, hey, could you do, I really, he's a guy I know.  And I should have called him instead of just relying on the fact that we have a good relationship with them  and that they would help me out and do the right thing.  That was my stupidity for thinking that I would make, you know, an issue would happen,  I would make a complaint about something.  Yeah, but you're confusing it again because they're not supposed to do it because we have a good relationship.  I understand that. 
[00:19:30]  They're supposed to do it because, like you said, this is a situation where they're supposed to just do their jobs.  Yeah, of course they are.  And you feel like they're not doing their jobs for you.  I absolutely feel that I'm doing their jobs.  Joe Citizen, not Jim Norton, stand-up comic extraordinaire.  Yeah, special favor.  Let's go to Richie Boy in Maryland.  Richie Boy.  Hey, what's up, Obi?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, Jimmy.  You guys are awesome.  Thank you.  I just wanted to welcome Jimmy to the rest of society.  Welcome to the rest of our world.  Well, again, this is not a case of the cops are brutal or the cops are bad. 
[00:20:00]  I'm not saying that.  I'm just really, really, I guess, surprised.  Frustrated and frustrated is a lack of concern and care that they're giving to your situation, whatever it may be.  Yeah, and complete indifference.  Yeah, exactly.  And unfortunately, because of the, you know, the nightmarish bullshit that they have to deal with,  and I don't know what your situation is, Jimmy, obviously. 
[00:20:30]  It's nothing life-threatening, dude.  It's nothing life-threatening, nothing physically violence-threatening.  It's not like that.  Maybe, do the detectives feel it's not worth their time?  Yes, they do.  Did they look into it at all?  I do not think so.  I think that...  They had better things to do?  Yeah.  Is what they would say?  And not even...  Even though it's obviously very important to you?  Yeah, and not a follow-up, no nothing.  Just basically...  Right.  The only way you're going to get anything done, Jimmy, is if you make some of those personal 
[00:21:00]  calls, because otherwise, you're going to get the typical shuffle, which is, we don't  give a fuck unless somebody's got a gun to your head.  It's just the way that it is, especially in a place like yours, where severe crime is  the order of the day.  Yeah.  We're all in the dark here.  Kevin from Connecticut wants to know if it's a foot thing that fell on your foot again.  I certainly tell him no, but thank you for his...  It's not a foot thing?  No, he's a podiatrist, so I understand why he has that.  Did a foot thing fall on his foot again, is the question from Kevin from Connecticut. 
[00:21:30]  All right, Richie, boy, let me go to Eddie.  Eddie, can you help little Jimmy Norton out?  Hello, boys.  How are you?  What's up, Eddie?  Not much.  I may be a city detective, and I'm willing to talk to Jimmy off-air if he wants a little  bit of help.  All right, thank you, Eddie.  Maybe we can get your information to Travis or something like that.  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, unfortunately, and I do identity theft and credit card stuff.  Most of the time.  Some of it, you know, some of it we can't investigate, and that's probably what happens 
[00:22:00]  to a lot of things.  No, I'm not going to get into...  I know I'm being a little vague, and I do apologize for that, but the thing is, I know  what they could have done.  Yep.  Because, again, I know a detective, and he told me what they could have and should have  done and what they did do.  So it's not like I'm not just speculating, like, bah, harumph, harumph.  They should have dropped everything.  Like, I know these guys have case loads, and I know it would have taken them.  According to the guy, I know he said it's a half hour.  It probably would have taken them a half hour.  So you want to talk...  I got no problem looking into it for you if you want, and, you know, again, I'm not 
[00:22:30]  going to take over someone else's job, but I have no problem talking to you and then  going from there.  So you want to talk to Eddie offline?  Yeah, maybe Travis can take his information.  Thanks, Eddie.  I appreciate it.  Let me put him on hold.  Maybe you should have contacted a medical examiner.  Oops.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I'm sure...  So what happened, Jimmy?  You were here all happy, and then how did this all turn, like, very quickly while I 
[00:23:00]  was asking Anthony about his silly T-shirt?  I didn't mean to.  I went outside the studio as we were starting up and asked somebody something and just  found out some information.  That's all.  It was just...  Ah!  And then I was like, ugh.  Because it's something I've been asking about.  Mm-hmm.  Something I've been asking about.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh...  You want to talk to Larry King?  I don't mind talking to Larry King.  All right.  Uh, Larry!  Good evening, Anthony and Opium. 
[00:23:30]  Opium.  Mr. Martin, I would like to talk to these officers and ask them, when looking for the rapists and  murderers throughout the city, how important is your tranny stalker?  Not a tranny or a stalker, sir.  Those would be issues that would be acceptable.  Yeah, of course.  I would understand those issues.  All right.  So, uh, the U-Haul truck was, uh, a guy.  Yeah.  He smelled gas.  This is the story.  He smells gas.  He's right before the tolls. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  He smells gas.  He goes into panic mode.  He just jumps out of his car and runs away.  Runs away.  And our city right now is a little skittish, so they shut down the entire bridge.  Does this idiot know that perhaps he should, uh, get out of his vehicle, walk up to one  of the monkeys in the goddamn, uh, uh, toll cages.  One of the preciouses.  Yeah.  Or, or, or just somebody.  Right.  Of authority over there and say what the problem is so the cops don't shut the fucking bridge 
[00:24:30]  down and leave people sitting in traffic like that.  People are dumb.  They shut it down for a few hours.  Dumb people.  Yeah.  I mean, we had a, had a little incident in Times Square.  I don't know if people know about that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, coming off the heels of that, you don't want to run away from a, a, a, a U-Haul  truck that smells like gas.  Yeah.  Exactly.  He just fucking ran for it.  Run away.  I heard they couldn't even find the guy.  I don't know if they found him.  What an asshole.  He should be, he should be fucking arrested. 
[00:25:00]  When I finally crashed, they still didn't find the guy.  So I don't know.  I'm assuming they know who he is, who this dummy is.  Should fucking be arrested.  And thrown off the fucking bridge while you're at it.  Asshole.  So we had that happening overnight and a lot of people thought, uh-oh, here we go.  Strike two.  Jesus Christ.  Uh, wow.  Jimmy's attempting to bite his own teeth off.  I've never seen that before.  He's very angry.  Just so.  How do you do that?  I'm just so irritated.  Yeah. 
[00:25:30]  No, the detectives will call you.  Okay.  I appreciate it, buddy.  Thank you so much.  Appreciate it.  We got a detective on the line.  We got a detective on the line.  And, uh, detective John, uh, uh, what's your name there, sir?  Is it detective John Kimball?  Yeah.  Stop whining.  Detective John Kimball says, stop whining.  What an asshole.  I had a better shot of him helping than fucking NYPD.  What is your problem?  What do you need? 
[00:26:00]  Right.  Remember?  Have we played the, uh, Arnold Schwarzenegger prank calls in a while?  I know.  Those are great.  Those are one for the ages.  Let's say hi to Bobby in the Bronx.  Bobby.  Hey there, Bab.  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  Listen, Jimmy, let me preface this by saying I know you're a supporter of, uh, of the NYPD and cops as a whole.  And, uh, you know, I'm sorry, uh, I'm sorry it's not working out for you the way you need it to.  But if I can give you a little bit of insight, you know, um, NYPD detects, especially in busy places. 
[00:26:30]  And, uh, I want to go out on a limb here and say that where you made your report is not a busy place.  But, uh, you know, the case catching, it's an unbelievable process.  You know, um, at any given time, a detective has 40 to 50 open cases on his desk.  And that's not an excuse, but the smallest stuff, you know, it gets moved to the back burner.  If you get a media case, if you get a homicide, you know, home invasion.  And, uh, a lot of times, you know, the decent people who have decent issues, it gets moved to the back burner.  And I, and I apologize for that. 
[00:27:00]  Also, you know, in recent years, detectives, the workload, the minor stuff that didn't used to be, uh, you know, on the detective's plate.  Like, for instance, you know, if, uh, Leticia calls Tyrone and threatens his life on the phone, you know, I shouldn't have to deal with that.  But that's an aggravated harassment.  That's something that the patrol takes the report for.  I follow up.  I have to go make the call on that.  You know, that's something that gets added to the pile.  You know, in the meantime, you know, people like you who have decent issues and need to be attentive.  You know, they get moved to the back burner. 
[00:27:30]  And what bothers me?  If I can help you, I will.  No, what happens is, it's, this is what bothers me.  It was the patrolman I spoke to, who, again, who was, who was great.  It was, it's the way it was handed off.  And because I happen to know someone who's a detective, like, you kind of know what it would have taken for them to help me and what I needed them to do.  There really was no investigating for them to do.  Um, I, I didn't need the detectives to open a case and, you know, and get out there and investigate.  Like, because, again, I do realize these guys are busy, man, and this is not on the level of fucking, you know, finding a terrorist or the million things they have to do. 
[00:28:00]  I'm not unrealistic.  And I, and I, that's why I'm very angry because I know what it would have taken because I know a detective.  So that, that's why I'm so angry.  I'm not blindly raising my fist going, oh, the damn NYPD.  Maybe it's a specific thing that they could have done and they just didn't feel like doing it.  And they closed it out without calling, without saying a word.  So like a, like a jerk off.  I've been trying to get answers for like 17 days on something and just totally nothing, nothing.  Well, we got, we got to keep in mind too, that there's jerk off in every job. 
[00:28:30]  You might've been dealing with a jerk off with busy playing solitary when he could be looking at your, uh, you know, whatever you got going on.  Well, I prefer, I prefer paper toss.  I know somebody else who had the same issue, a similar issue with the exact same, let's just say, uh, precinct.  And he felt the same way I felt with the, you know, detectives.  Well, Jimmy, um, everyone's in the dark.  So they're trying to figure this out.  Chris Johnson from Utah writes, are they looking for your chin?  Tell Chris Johnson that is not the issue.  That's insensitive. 
[00:29:00]  You want the guy that stole your chin brought to justice?  Thank you, buddy.  That is very insensitive.  Hey, we got a guy named, uh, Cruising Collin on the line.  Cruising Collin.  Hey, how's it going, boys?  Hey, Collin.  I just, just wanted to apologize for leaving my truck on the bridge.  You know, I was just going to pick up some friends in my new U-Haul and gas leak.  It's stupid.  Someone.  I was punching out, boys.  Pretty good, Collin.  Well, Cruising Collin is taking responsibility for the U-Haul. 
[00:29:30]  Cruising Collin.  Well, that went down the other day.  He was so depressed because he knew it was one for the ages.  He knew it was just going to be a character.  One for the fucking ages.  Well, yeah.  Oh, we have more on the U-Haul truck on the bridge there.  Pat in Staten Island.  Pat.  Yeah, good morning, boys.  Hey.  The detectives were, they were investigating that U-Haul truck, found cases and cases of  flyers.  And those flyers said that little Jim Norton will be playing down the Bogata on the weekend  of July 4th. 
[00:30:00]  Ah.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Tickets on sale tomorrow at 10 a.m.  Thank you, sir.  That's why, that's why the detectives couldn't help you out, Jim, because they were investigating  that U-Haul.  Yeah.  So, I'm watching out.  Thank you.  All right.  We got another detective on the line here.  Detective, who are you?  Detective Monaghan.  Oh, hi, Detective Monaghan.  Detective Monaghan.  Detective Monaghan.  Yeah, I was wanting to, I was wanting to talk to one James Norton.  Mr. Norton, did you get a good look at the tranny before it removed your glasses, sir? 
[00:30:30]  Get out of here a little bit.  Detective Monaghan.  Hi, you know, Quince, I'm not sure what I can do, because we're going to play cards  like Speed from The Odd Couple.  I'm the same guy, Quince.  It really is.  Well, a lot of sympathy coming in.  Hi, who's this?  I don't have your name on the phone thing here.  This is Digger Nick.  All right.  What's up, brother?  Oh.  I'd like to reverse that.  Oh, you get it?  Yeah, we got it. 
[00:31:00]  We got it.  Of course, yes, exactly.  So you get it.  Jesus.  Anyway, Jimmy, I want you to know that I contact the police every time they run out of chicken  and Popeye's, too.  Oh, see what happened.  It was nothing that serious, sir.  Jimmy wanted to get his bucket, his bucket in.  Got to get your bucket.  Yeah, he wanted to get his bucket.  He couldn't do that.  Get my bucket.  Uh-huh.  Let's say hi to Dan in Tennessee.  Dan?  I'm always loving the show, but why are we even discussing this if we can't even talk  about what it is that happened? 
[00:31:30]  It's talking about, not talking about what happened.  I mean, how long can that go on?  Well, it only went on for a few minutes.  I mean, we understand that you're having a situation where I ought to just move on,  and we can't even discuss what it's about.  So do me a favor.  Stop listening.  If you're not interested in what's happening, sometimes you can't do certain things you can't  discuss, so I discuss what I...  No, let me finish.  How can you be interested in what's happening when you don't even know what...  Then don't be interested.  You're not even talking about what actually happened. 
[00:32:00]  Then don't be interested.  I don't give a fuck if you're interested.  Well, then why?  Why don't you quit crying about what you can't talk about?  I wonder if there's a subject that can be talked about.  Here's the issue that can be talked about.  What happened is none of your fucking business.  The issue was, the issue was, the detectives didn't do what they were supposed to do.  That I can talk about.  What's the matter, you nosy?  You fucking woman?  What are you, a fucking woman?  Do you got to know the details?  Tell me everything!  Shut up, you fucking girl!  I'm not a drama queen. 
[00:32:30]  I just said that they didn't do their jobs, and I know they didn't do their jobs.  How many times do we have to hear that?  You're a fucking woman.  You want the details, you nosy woman?  Turn it off, you fucking girl!  Put on hits for a little while.  Sorry, fucking aunt, you didn't get the information.  Why don't you end the subject, and just say, hey, I can't really talk about it.  Because that's not the way I wanted to address it.  The way I address things, the way I address things, turn him down a little bit.  You're not going to talk over me, scumbag fuck.  Turn it down, turn it down, turn it down, turn it down. 
[00:33:00]  All the way down, please.  No, I can't really forget.  Now he's spinning.  Jesus Christ.  What do you want, Jimmy?  You want dad?  Go.  No.  No.  All right, Dan, thank you.  That's all.  That's all.  Thanks for your phone call.  All right.  All right.  What a tool.  Leave Jimmy alone.  Leave Jimmy alone.  Leave Jimmy alone. 
[00:33:30]  That stinks.  Oof.  E-Rock didn't make it in, huh?  No.  You had a little tummy ache?  I'm trying to get a...  From his mayonnaise.  I'm trying to get a mayonnaise update.  His mayo.  Yeah.  He must have been on the shitter. 
[00:34:00]  Must have been on the shitter.  The videos are pretty good.  I had a fucking hell of a time uploading last night with my stupid internet.  The gurgling sound was very good.  It was classic, yeah.  Very classic.  He did tweet that he was puking for the sixth time.  Sixth?  Yeah.  I know of three.  So I don't know if he puked six times after the show.  Yeah.  Or was just adding on and counting.  Well, mayo is something that he had a lot of. 
[00:34:30]  And even though he puked here three times, I could see how, as it worked through his system  a little bit more, he probably puked a lot more.  Yeah.  He called in sick around one.  And then...  One this morning.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Just sitting on the bowl.  Well...  His fat ass sitting on the bowl.  Shitting out mayonnaise.  I would imagine it turned into explosive diarrhea.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, the puking was the least of his problems.  I think it turned into explosive diarrhea probably sometime around, I would guess, 10 o'clock  at night. 
[00:35:00]  If I was a guessing man.  Sam!  I think he's right outside the door.  Are you scared to come in?  Look at Sam.  What is he?  He's a little pensive, aren't you?  What's the matter?  I didn't know if this was passing or if you wanted an EROC update.  Yeah.  And kind of went for an EROC update.  Well, there's more than meets the eye with EROC's sickness, I think. 
[00:35:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Because he's extremely, extremely mad at me.  Still?  Really.  He won't talk to me.  He won't say a word to me.  And he again left at 11 o'clock yesterday because I think it's because he didn't want to deal  with me.  Now, he already is taking Friday off and that was, you know, already scheduled.  So I said, you know, I'll take care of helping.  I'll build the countdown because that's when we put the countdown together for the weekend. 
[00:36:00]  Well, of course.  Very important.  And I said, just, you know, give me all the information I need beforehand.  And this was on Monday before he got mad at me.  And I go, okay.  And then he leaves early yesterday and tells Steve, look, I may be calling out tomorrow.  Oh, when he left.  Yeah.  And then he wouldn't send Steve any information for the countdown at first.  Wait, we're going to try to say that E-Rock's faking a sickness after what we saw yesterday?  But it was a lot sooner than 1.30 a.m. 
[00:36:30]  I know we all want to jump on E-Rock at any chance we get, but I think we saw why he might  be sick today, man.  I'm not saying he's faking, but I am saying that he's going out of his way to make sure  that the countdown is as difficult as possible for me.  So Steve emailed him twice saying, look, you have to send the information.  Right.  I left here at 4 o'clock yesterday.  Yeah.  Sometime between 4 p.m. and 4 a.m.  He was here because he left it. 
[00:37:00]  He came in when he knew I wouldn't be here and he left the countdown stuff on my desk.  Interesting.  Just interesting.  He came in sometime last night when he knew I wouldn't be here.  Why does he hate you so much?  That's nice.  I think it's because he thinks I spent all his money.  Yeah.  Which you did.  Which I did.  Wow.  But he wasn't responding.  I was trying to send him professional text messages last night. 
[00:37:30]  I told him, it's okay if you're mad at me personally.  But strictly business.  But I'm trying.  And no, nothing.  This is business.  And he's sick today.  Called in at 1.  What is he saying, Steve?  Oh, he just, the only correspondence I got was at 1 a.m.  I'm out sick.  Sam's got, Sam has the intros and the production for the countdown on his desk.  And that was what threw me.  I'm like, well, how did it get out?  And how did it get in his desk? 
[00:38:00]  But I wasn't about to.  Why is he emailing at 1?  Yeah.  And why is he, you know.  But look, he did eat an entire jar of mayonnaise last night.  So, yesterday, so.  But it did, he didn't actually eat the mayonnaise.  It was thrown out.  Well, he threw it out.  Fucking Danny, Jesus.  There's really no question as to why he's ill, is my point.  No.  There are some questions.  Yeah.  All right.  So he's out today.  He could be.  You know, that's just it.  I tried.  We've been.  Oh, he's not picking up the phone.  I mean, everyone wants an update after the mayo challenge yesterday. 
[00:38:30]  So we should get an update.  He's showing irresponsibility if he's not giving us an update today from his sickbed.  Yeah, I agree.  All he has to do is wake up for about 10, 15 minutes, give us an update, and go back to bed.  Exactly.  Then take care of his fucking raging asshole.  His prolapsed ass.  Mayo ass.  Oh, just dripping white mayonnaise.  Yeah.  The videos are pretty fucking good, actually.  How many scoops did he do? 
[00:39:00]  22?  Yeah, I think it was 22.  22 heaping spoonfuls of mayonnaise.  There were maybe six to eight scoops left in the jar.  That's how much he ate.  He's a fucking quitter, man.  Yeah, I agree.  How do you get that close and not finish?  He couldn't talk.  Huh?  He couldn't talk from his gurgling puking.  Yeah.  We had two massive pukes, and then he said, okay, next puke, I'm done.  Next puke, I'm done.  And then only took two spoonfuls.  Right.  But he was only six away from finishing? 
[00:39:30]  That's because we said there was about ten left when he got to 20, and then he got two  more, so there's probably six to eight scoops left.  Yeah.  You would think when you puke, though, then you're starting over.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  His stomach's all cleared out.  Yeah, yeah.  It's all fun.  Well, you would think that.  There's nothing left there.  The best part about the whole thing was the reaction to the very first scoop when he went,  ah, delicious.  Yeah, he liked the first scoop.  He enjoyed the first couple.  He was very happy.  Yeah.  It quickly turned to shite.  He was miserable by the end.  I would like to settle the beef between...  Oh, would you? 
[00:40:00]  Well, how are you going to settle it?  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  The only way to settle it is to give him his money back that he really feels is his.  It's an impossibility at this point.  Well, then how the fuck are you going to settle that?  It's a good question.  And now he's made money, so if you give him all the money back, he'll be way ahead of the  game, and I don't think that'll teach him.  Exactly.  It would just be like, oh, maybe if I pout, I can get more money.  I told Anthony yesterday that E-Rock, say what you will about him, but he was just minding  his own business, and next thing you know, he's out $500, and then to get $300, not 
[00:40:30]  even all of the $500 back, he's got to puke his brains out for an hour straight.  Give him his money, Sam!  Yeah, but if I gave him his money back, and then he did the very easy task of losing 10  pounds in two weeks, which you can do, with discipline, that would be $1,250 that was  never originally his, just for being E-Rock.  Yeah.  Just for...  All right, so he shouldn't be mad.  Yeah! 
[00:41:00]  Get him on the fucking phone, because we want an update.  We want to see how he's doing after that Mayo thing yesterday.  Plus, he won the lottery five years ago, so...  Yeah, I know.  He's doing okay.  Yeah.  It's dumping straight to voicemail.  What the fuck, man?  Bang on his fucking door.  I don't know, we want to make sure he's safe, too.  Why would he be so inconsiderate?  I hope he's safe.  I don't want to jump to conclusions.  Do you really want to know if he's safe?  Come on.  I'm busy. 
[00:41:30]  Come on.  Come on.  We got Detective Columbo on the line.  Detective Columbo.  What?  Yes.  Mr. Norton, can I call you Jim?  Yes.  Is there something about a dress?  I'm looking through my notes here.  Is there something about a dress?  Is there...  Is there a dress?  Is there a dress?  Is there a dress?  Is there something about a dress?  Can you help me out? 
[00:42:00]  Right.  Nope.  No.  Nope.  Plenty of rope.  Swing in the breeze, my friend.  I'm not bailing you out of that awful fucking call.  Swing in the breeze.  Mike in Pennsylvania.  Mike.  Mike.  Morning, boys.  Hi, Mikey.  I got to the bottom to lie.  What's going on?  Somebody kidnapped Chip and Jimmy's mad because nobody cares.  I don't care if anybody cares, honestly, sir.  And what that Dan cunt said on the phone about, oh, you can't give up. 
[00:42:30]  No, I can't.  So I don't.  My issue is, you know, that's something that they could have done, they didn't do.  So I'm pissed off about it.  And that's how I handle it.  I'm pissed off.  I talk about it on the air.  And if it's not interesting, then fucking turn something else on.  Turn something else on.  For fucking five minutes.  Sorry.  Why don't you do that, boys?  All right, buddy.  All right.  That's how we start today.  Wow.  I want to say congratulations to Craig Harrison. 
[00:43:00]  Corporal Craig Harrison.  Yeah.  Of the, um, he's from England.  He's, uh, set a new sniping record.  Damn.  New sniping record.  Killed two.  Two people in Afghanistan that were 1.54 miles away from him with a rifle.  Jesus.  Killed both of them. 
[00:43:30]  With one shot?  With, uh, well, yeah, that would have really been amazing.  Wow.  But how do they know that's a record?  Two shots.  Um, because the previous record.  But do they pace these things off?  Yeah, they just know after they kill them.  Yeah.  You kind of look and go.  They actually do measurements after these?  That's true.  These sniper attacks?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  He, uh.  1.54 miles.  8,120 feet, the shots.  They were fired well beyond the, uh, long-range rifle's effective range of 4,921 feet. 
[00:44:00]  Wow.  So he really pushed that weapon to the ultimate.  To compensate, Harrison had to aim 20 inches to the left and six feet high.  Wow.  He had to aim six feet high and 20 inches left, uh, in order to nail these guys.  He took two shots, took out two of the, uh, uh, Taliban.  And then a third shot that disabled the machine gun that these two characters were, character, 
[00:44:30]  uh, were using, uh, to fire at his troop commander.  And he was a mile, 1.54 miles away, hit both of them.  But how do you, how do you calculate that?  Six feet high, 20 inches, inches to the right, you said?  Yeah, you get, that's how.  With that scope.  It's, uh.  Yeah, but what is that based on?  Obviously, uh, elevation, you're only going to, uh, distance.  How much of that is the wind?  You're going to arc. 
[00:45:00]  Well, that's probably the 20 inches left.  That's all that is?  Is, is wind.  And then the other thing is for elevation.  Six feet high is because you're going to get the bullet arcing.  Right.  Just losing energy.  Uh, but he nailed.  Wow.  He nailed both of these motherfuckers.  You get a spotter, you get the sniper, they figure it all out.  Figure out the range, what you got to do.  They know their rifles, like the back of their hands.  Yeah, but the 20 inches, I mean, you got to, how do you figure out the wind?  Yeah, exactly.  Between you and a mile .54. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, it's a toughie.  How do you do that?  That's what makes, that's why people aren't making these amazing shots all the time.  Do you send a spotter out there with a wet, with a wet finger?  Yeah, a wet finger standing by the guys.  Yeah, it's 20 inches left.  He's right next to the guy.  He's making a cell phone call.  Yeah, you see the guy next to me?  Oh, that's, that's unbelievable, huh?  Yeah, hell, hell of a shot.  Hell of a shot.  And he was using a, um, he wasn't using a 50.  He was using a, uh, 8.59 millimeter, not a 50 cal, so it's, uh, it's not bad, because 
[00:46:00]  it's, um, a smaller bullet.  So it's going to be affected, uh, a lot more.  All right.  So congratulations.  He took the record away from that Canuck, from that Canadian.  And how did the Canadian, uh, set the record?  Eh, he did it from like a mile.  But where?  Uh, Afghanistan.  Oh, Afghanistan.  Yeah, they're just picking up.  So a lot of records are being knocked out.  A lot of them should be in the Guinness Book of World Records.  Snipers.  Way better than the fucking twins on those stupid motorcycles. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, exactly.  Who cares about that?  Or, or the guy with all the cigarettes in his mouth.  Yes.  Wonderful.  Good.  Those guys must have exploded.  Oh, this guy, uh, Tom in North Carolina.  Tom.  Tom.  Hey, part of the reason why he aimed so far to the left was because the rifling in the,  in the barrel, the bullet spins to the right.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  So the cavitation would pull it that way as it, on that, that grade of a distance.  Didn't even think about that.  That's amazing.  So you gotta, you gotta deal with the bullet rotating too? 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  The barrel, the barrel's rifled.  So the bullet will hold steady, not just tumble.  I didn't even think of that.  Wow.  Okay.  Wow.  That's something.  I don't know shit about this.  It's fascinating though.  That's a long shot.  Yes, sir.  Did you watch the, uh, that show on, I think it was on that Gio about the snipers and they  showed the guy from Vietnam when he shot the Vietnamese guy through his scope and hit  him right in the eye and killed him at about a thousand yards.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, Danny.  Yeah.  Is that the same guy where they, where they were set up, uh, they ended up stalking each 
[00:47:30]  other and then they both ended up in each other's nests.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was always the sun glinting off of the guy and he had an eyepiece on his scope and  he just aimed for the sun glint and hit him right in the eye through the scope.  And that's a hell of a shot.  Yeah.  That was a pretty cool special.  The History Channel and like Nat Geo and Discovery, they always have these like really  awesome like gun shooting shows.  It's the greatest shows.  Yes.  Like marksmanship contests and weird sniper shit like that.  It's awesome.  Wonderful.  Yeah.  I'm a big gun collector.  I kind of get into all that stuff.  Love those. 
[00:48:00]  Damn it.  Thank you, sir.  Uh, there's other factors, Ant.  You were saying wind and elevation.  Wind and distance and elevation.  And this guy's going to add a couple more things you got to kind of throw into the equation.  Oh, really?  Matt in Jersey.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, Matt.  Hey, there's other things that snipers look at, too.  They take into like relative humidity.  Yeah.  And also the curvature of the Earth comes into effect as well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Temperature and humidity affects bullets flight.  Really?  How far it's going to go. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Denser air.  It's not going to go as far.  I'm going to give it a little more.  How the fuck do you figure all that out?  It's just a fucking amazing science.  You figure out how much sweat is coming off your balls?  Yeah.  You feel the underside of your nutsack.  And then set the scope accordingly?  If it's really sweaty, yeah.  You get a nutsack adjustment.  That's your spotter's job.  They wipe up the nutsack drip.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's crazy what the spotter does because essentially the sniper himself is just doing 
[00:49:00]  what the spotter says.  Yeah.  The spotter is really the guy.  The guy with the spotting scope that's telling the sniper the adjustments that he should be  making on his scope and what he should be doing.  Those guys are amazing.  So the other guy just pulls the trigger?  He takes the shot.  And gets the record?  Yeah.  Do they both get the record?  They're just like, as a team, yeah.  But the spotter doesn't really get all the glory that the sniper gets.  And he's the guy that's making all the calculations. 
[00:49:30]  And he's got a little kind of a closer range rifle near him just in case anybody creeps up on him.  He's the guy that's got to cover both their asses.  How great was the sniper scene in Hurt Locker?  Oh, I know.  One of the best ever, right?  Fantastic one.  One of the best ever?  Yeah, where they're just sitting there.  Because I love the perspective where they, you know, usually in films they show the sniper  and you never, you never, they don't show the victim or whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  His perspective.  I thought that was so cool in Hurt Locker.  Definitely.  All of a sudden they fire the shot the sniper does and then they go to the other side to 
[00:50:00]  see where the bullet's hitting.  That was just amazing.  Look at History HD has a show called The Longest Shot.  Well, this is about the guy whose record was just broke.  Yeah.  This is the Canadian guy who hit those, the Afghanistan dude from like over a mile away.  So they're showing like a big water jug, whatever, exploding.  How far away was that?  They didn't have it at the water cooler.  How far away was that?  Oh, I don't remember the tests, like some of the recreations. 
[00:50:30]  Okay.  You could see the projectile coming out of that.  That's like that one of them Barrett 50 cals.  Imagine how fucked up that is to get shot though, because like you would, you'd get shot,  look and see blood and like, you're like, oh fuck, I'm, I'm hit.  And then you would hear the gunshot.  Unless your head is just gone.  Yeah.  That's fucked up.  Hey, thank you, Matt.  Yeah.  One more thing.  Oh, sure.  Wasn't that a, that show that guy was just talking about before where the guy got shot  down the sniper barrel or the scope?  Wasn't that from Saving Private Ryan? 
[00:51:00]  I don't know.  They might've adapted some realistic thing to a movie, but.  Right.  I don't know.  Yeah.  It's based on some fact, I guess.  That would suck those thing, a bullet coming out of your eye.  All right, guys.  All right.  Mythbusters actually did that to see if you could actually shoot through a scope.  I think it, I mean, it would have to be like a one in a million  shot.  They couldn't replicate the shot, but yeah, you could do it, but it would  have to be like the right, the exact right scope, the exact right ammo.  And I think they went with that plausible on that one.  They went with plausible. 
[00:51:30]  I hate when they go with plausible.  I hate the plausible.  It is kind of a top out.  It's either yes or no.  I fucking hate plausible.  It's either busted.  Right.  Or, uh, busted because we suck should be one of the answers.  Not plausible.  I hate the plausible.  I'm so with you.  What do you mean plausible?  You got a whole show.  Anything's plausible.  Right.  Anyone can luck out.  Motherfuckers.  I've watched some of those older ones that they have on now.  The one was, uh, last, yesterday in the afternoon, there was the one where they put  like the three or four dead pigs in a Corvette. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, was that disgusting.  Yeah.  You kind of forget some of the extremes that they, they do go to.  What were they trying to do?  They wanted to see if you could sell a car after someone had died in it.  Because they say that the smell would be just so putrid that no one would buy the  car.  There was, they did a lot more that were based on urban legends back at the beginning when  that show first hit the air.  And, uh, they just kind of run out of urban legends after a while.  So they, they went on to other things like movie myths and stuff.  They were really, you got to give it to them.  They were able to take the show and kind of change direction with it. 
[00:52:30]  Um, and not just keep doing urban myths.  Uh, but at first it was just urban legends.  And there was an urban legend that some beautiful car was in somebody's garage and they were  trying to sell it and, uh, someone had died in it and had putrefied and, uh, they could  not sell this wonderful Corvette.  I think it was.  Were they doing like a Pulp Fiction?  Um, no, it was somebody that had just died and rotted in a car.  Just rotted?  Not like Marvin with his face.  Right.  Oh, I think if you're rotting in a car, you could fucking resell it. 
[00:53:00]  Well, they put the paint in there.  Some kind of gunshot blast while you're sitting in a car.  All the specks of flesh you got to find that are rotting away.  You got to take it to the old detail shop and clean it up.  But they put the pigs in there and, um, just left them in there to rot.  Well, not only that, but they sealed it up.  Like they made sure to make the car pretty much airtight.  And then they put the entire car in like a shipping container just to, you know, just  to take out at any kind of variable whatsoever.  It's like weather wouldn't even affect it or anything.  And then like once they, I think they left it there for a few months. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  And then when it was time to.  Who the fuck opened the container?  They did it for the first time.  Biohazard suits on and respirators.  And the respirators wouldn't even work.  It went right.  The smell went right through.  Yeah.  They basically, they liquefied pigs inside of a Corvette.  Yeah.  They turned into liquid.  There was really nothing left of the pig except just a puddle of ick.  From the heat?  From just rotting.  Just the gases that you, that bodies produce when they're decomposing.  And it was on everything.  Like it had left mold and shit on like every surface of this car. 
[00:54:00]  And they got a cleaning company.  They did everything they could to clean this out.  And they even ripped out the interior as well.  Yeah.  So that way it was, it was like, you know, even if a seat was the perpetrator of smell,  the seat was gone.  Yeah.  So all the smell that remained was just, just soaking into like the frame.  Into the steel.  It was just, it's stuck.  They could not get rid of it.  They couldn't resell it, obviously.  They sold it.  I think it was plausible.  I think they sold it for a parts car. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Like some guy, he had a Vette, you know, he wanted it.  So he ended up, you know, they did sell the car in the long run.  And then what, did he boil the car for a year?  Well, it was funny because they set up hidden cameras and stuff and this one lady goes by  and like the minute she gets just to, like she crosses that threshold of stake and she's  just like, whoa, what is that?  Jesus.  I love that show.  I know, it was a good show.  I haven't watched that one in a while either.  And my chick is back.  Congratulations, Carrie.  Yeah, Carrie had her baby and she's back.  Looking good, too. 
[00:55:00]  Hell yeah, she bounced back pretty quick.  Still looks good.  She bounced back.  Hell yeah.  What, the chick on Mythbusters?  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we take our first break?  A lot of people want to talk about sniping it.  I think we did it, right?  Yeah, we told all the stuff.  We don't need the particulars.  Okay.  But that's a hell of a shot.  A new record, 1.54 miles.  By a limey.  Unbelievable.  A limey.  Okay.  We'll get into some other things in just a bit here.  Stay.  And now, Unnecessary Cruelty.  Fuck you. 
[00:55:30]  With James Norton of the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Have a chuckle as Jimmy verbally thrashes a caller for no good reason whatsoever.  Steve in South Carolina.  What do you got for the show?  Good evening.  What?  Washington State, over the weekend, a convicted murderer was released, was let go at the county  fair.  He was on a...  All right.  We fucking covered this already, dude.  Holy shit.  All right, dude.  Forgive me.  We fucking covered this.  Okay.  Later.  Yeah, right. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, did he get mad at you?  Oh, was that fun?  That was certainly unnecessary.  Stay tuned for more Unnecessary Cruelty on the O.B. and Anthony Show.  We want to hear what's inside your little brain.  Call 866-866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  The O.B. and Anthony Show on the virus. 
[00:56:30]  Sirius XM.  A little peace frog?  Yeah, that's what this is, hey?  Let's listen to Jim Morrison this time around.  Where's the kick in at?  Right about here?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  You know I'm not a big Morrison fan.  Not a big Doors Morrison fan. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, that's your problem.  Yeah, I know.  We all have our tastes.  Kevin Smith's birthday today?  Holy shit.  Happy birthday to Kevin Smith.  How old is Kevin today?  Let's wake him up in L.A. just to wish him a happy birthday.  I'm sure he'd love that.  It's not on my sheet, though.  I don't know.  Is Kevin Smith's birthday today?  Or are we a day off?  No, it's August 2nd.  We just blurt shit out with absolutely nothing to back it up with.  Stupid me just trusting instant feedback. 
[00:57:30]  Let me think.  We're off by two and a half months, almost three months.  We are the worst.  Wow.  Why do we feel compelled to just blurt stuff out as if it's fact with nothing to back it  up but a dummy on instant feedback or some dummy that's quoted here in front of me?  It's our confidence.  It really is.  We have too much confidence.  We have confidence in ourselves, our listeners. 
[00:58:00]  We can ass out of you and me.  That's what happens when you assume.  I read that somewhere.  It's clever.  I never heard that.  No.  Oh, because I don't want to call him personally.  Yeah.  I want to thank Stephen Singer from I Hate Stephen Singer.  Yes.  Down there in Philly.  IHateStevenSinger.com.  Hey, Stephen, I want to thank you for that thing.  Oh, yeah?  I want to thank you for that thing.  Do you a favor?  Because, first of all, if I do call him, it goes to voicemail anyway.  So, this is your phone call.  Thanks for that thing.  Do you use the 1-800-I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER number? 
[00:58:30]  No.  Oh, you got a special number.  I'll give it to you.  I'll give it to everybody so they can get their stuff.  I don't need that guy getting my number, calling me all the time.  Not you.  Want to hang out?  I'm going to give everyone Stephen Singer's personal fucking cell number.  Oh.  Oh, so that way if they want to get a really good deal, instead of calling the 1-800-I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER  number, they could just call his personal cell phone.  Yeah.  How would he be so pissed?  Would he?  Can I have some gold-covered roses? 
[00:59:00]  What the fuck is this?  All right.  Stephen's a good egg.  Ah, we got a weatherman fucking up.  Listen to this.  Now, you can see over the region, not much activity going on.  Relatively clear.  And it looks like we're going to continue to see some chances for some showers moving  in from the northwest as we get into tomorrow afternoon.  Uh-oh.  Oh, I better put on my rubbers.  It's going to be relatively queer out.  Let's see where is that on the map. 
[00:59:30]  Right over my house.  A bunch of raindrops with my face on them.  Foundry cogs are falling from the sky.  You should put on a complete rubber suit.  Fuck that dude.  Yes.  He's going to need rubber from head to toe.  A chance of queerness.  He's going to go outside looking like a scuba diver.  It's going to be a beautiful gay.  I better get out my shovel so I can clear the driveway and shovel it into my mouth.  What are you saying with that? 
[01:00:00]  It's come.  Yes.  Relatively queer.  That's what I am when I'm your cousin.  Not a day goes by in this place without that son of a bitch being called a homo.  Well, here's the longer version of that clip because I guess he giggles the entire time.  Oh, does he?  He can't hold it in?  He realized he made it funny and he just had to enjoy it.  Yes. 
[01:00:30]  Now, you can see over the region, not much activity going on.  Relatively clear.  And it looks like we're going to continue to see some chances for some showers moving in from the northwest as we get into tomorrow afternoon.  Here's what it looks like as far as those temperatures coming through for that cold.  It looks like we're going to see why do you go back to the last?  You're past it.  He can't help it.  No, he was holding it.  Dude, you could tell he was holding it back, trying from the second he said relatively queer until the time he started giggling again. 
[01:01:00]  He was trying.  That's not.  The picture Danny just showed is not relatively queer.  That's thunderstorm queer.  Those are two like fucking hailstorm queer.  That's not plausible.  No, I don't find that plausible.  No.  It's two men, I mean muscle-bound, biker-looking men tatted up with leather vests on and jockstraps.  They would easily fuck us up.  Easily.  And they got beards on, and they're licking each other's tongues. 
[01:01:30]  Did you talk about the leather vests?  Of course.  And the tattoos?  Yes.  The worst part is the thumb on the nipple.  The right thumb on the nipple is the worst part.  One man is diddling the other man's hairy chested nipple.  Oh, hoolly hoo.  Because he likes nip play.  Tweet-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee with his thumb.  Guys like nip play.  Oh, God.  It looks like Rogan on the left.  Yeah.  I never understood nip play.  I love my nipples play with.  Yeah, I don't, man.  They're fucking sensitive. 
[01:02:00]  Fuck.  Nah, it takes me out of it.  In a bad way, man.  I'm from the school of grab my cock.  I wish.  I wish that was enough.  My cock is not part of a three-item set.  One cock, two nipples, and it should equal me and smiling.  Yeah.  Girls gotta work you like a machine.  Yeah.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Pulling levers and turning knobs.  Switches.  Just being bored flicking two nipples gently while I make cum on her.  Make cumzies.  Is that relatively queer, this picture?  Oh, my God. 
[01:02:30]  That is.  Hey, who was the homophobe that got caught with a rent boy, by the way?  Some big Christian, I think.  But he was all against the gays.  Oh, of course he is.  It's always those guys, right?  The love when they got busted.  It's always the guys that are so against the gays that are doing a lot of gays stuff.  The ones that are protesting a little too much about anything.  If you're so personally upset with something that really doesn't concern you,  it means it really does concern you privately.  You are really into it. 
[01:03:00]  Worst excuse ever.  They said he took the guy to Europe for like an eight or ten day vacation.  He goes, I have trouble bending.  He carries my bags.  Oh, he sure does.  And he empties them too.  Ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba.  Trust the bridge of his nose.  Ten day holiday with a male prostitute.  Ten days.  Well, and this guy was, what was his whole thing as far as the gays go?  He was really, help me out here.  He's a professor, George Reckers, a Baptist minister. 
[01:03:30]  Sorry if I said Christian, I apologize.  I don't know if that's the same thing.  Baptist minister who believes homosexuality is a sin that can be cured.  20-year-old Puerto Rican as his travel companion from a website called rentboy.com.  He loves the unclicked.  We go to rentboy.com.  The 61-year-old father of three took the escort, who is known on the gay networking site as Gio,  on a 10-day trip to London and Madrid.  And he's preaching that being gay is against what?  The Lord? 
[01:04:00]  Oh, man.  Is that the guy?  And that's his little guy that he took to pick up shit because he can't bend over?  They've offered to a company to lift luggage.  He was not involved in any illegal or sexual behavior with his travel assistant.  Stop it.  That guy was sucking unclipped cock.  I think I read in one that the guy said he had eight inches uncuts.  Can you go down?  I did read more about this.  I did say that.  Yeah, maybe it's not there.  He's also a member of the Family Research Council.  Another one of these fucking assholes.  Oh, how great is it? 
[01:04:30]  And, dude, look at him.  Look at that picture of him.  He looks like he fits in perfectly with the guy that wants a young Puerto Rican to drive it home.  Yeah, the mustache is a rough one, man.  He's got the big walrus-y mustache.  Especially when you hit middle age.  You know what I mean?  I mean, that's like an old-school mustache.  Yeah.  At least you've got some stuff going on with your mustache.  You know what I mean?  I'm trying.  You know, what am I going to do?  I'm slowly getting rid of it.  I'm slowly phasing it out, making it a little thinner and thinner, and then I'll be gone one day. 
[01:05:00]  Are you going to go clean-shaving again?  Yeah, yeah.  I saw that once over the years.  Yeah, but that was bad.  I was real skinny at the time and just, yeah.  Now, you know, I'm packing on the muscle.  That wasn't a moan, by the way.  That was more of a, like, yeah, I remember.  Yeah, it was just.  I just want to make that perfectly clear for everyone.  Yeah.  You said I was really skinny at the time, and I went, mm.  Yeah, mm.  It was more of a, yeah, I remember.  Yeah.  Because I was just thin, if not thinner. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  We were a fucking mess.  I'm going to go with that Hitler.  Hitler, but it's always those guys, right?  Look at Elliot Spitzer.  He was all against the.  Prostitution.  Prostitution.  He was going after all the prostitutes.  It turns out he was, like.  Loving the prostitutes.  A great client.  This guy, to me, is worse, though, because.  I mean, technically, prostitution's a crime, so technically, even though Spitzer was a twat, he was.  Right.  This guy is a fucking.  If he's guilty of fucking, this guy is a dirtbag.  You don't find a butler to carry your fucking luggage on rentboy.com. 
[01:06:00]  So, just going to this site makes you gay.  Where is he from?  Look at this site.  Florida.  The guy was from Florida, right?  Let's find out where the Baptist minister was from and then go there and let's search out what lads might be available.  Is that guy jerking off that other guy?  Certainly.  Hope so.  In that little, tiny, little video that's playing?  Jesus.  Yeah, he's giving a little jerk job.  He's massaging his penis through his boxers.  How come there's no.  I can't see.  It's so, it's like a, it's the size of a postage stamp.  I wasn't sure what was going on in that little corner. 
[01:06:30]  There's no pictures on that site or animations or videos of people carrying luggage or bending over to pick things up.  Unless they're bending over to, you know.  But there is a lot of really nice dicks.  Save that.  Oh, I know.  You recognize him by his dick.  Oh, God.  See, the backwards dick thing, I don't know how.  Guy's laying on his stomach and he pushed everything backwards.  His balls and dick.  So it's just facing to the rear. 
[01:07:00]  It looks like he's shitting a dick.  Yeah.  Sometimes that happens.  Yes.  Is it supposed to bend that way?  I think if it's soft, it will.  Yeah, but if you're fully, you know.  By the way, could you go to the bottom?  That looks like it would be a tough fold.  The top, you mean?  The bottom.  A tough fold.  I love this guy's photo shoot.  He's standing in front of a horrible fucking plant.  Yeah, what is that?  He's showing, he's naked.  His dick is hard or whatever, but my favorite part is the horribly lit background.  It was obviously very dark and someone used a flash camera.  Yeah.  It kind of got a load of the background.  That guy's hanging out of his little fucking underoos. 
[01:07:30]  Jesus.  That's who you need to carry your luggage.  That is not a site you go to to find people to carry your luggage.  I'm sorry.  The man with his seats or underpants?  That man is a fruit, yeah.  He's very muscular.  He can carry a lot of things.  Maybe that's it.  A lot of things.  Let's go to Bill in Savannah.  Bill.  Hello, Bill.  That minister is a fucking scumbag.  Yeah, he's a real piece of shit.  This is the truth.  Going after the gays as you're fucking going to rent.  Yeah.  I've sinned against you, my lord.  Bunch of horse shit.  Bill, what do you got, buddy?  Hey, guys. 
[01:08:00]  I got another example of your news reporting when you really didn't know what was happening.  You gave that guy such a hard time the other day about the mile-long hose to the bottom of the ocean,  and today that's what they're doing.  Well, I'm going to jump in.  That guy did not say a mile-long hose.  He said a mile-long pipe.  Right.  And just put the visual in your own head.  How the fuck is that possible?  He didn't say a pipe that they're going to put together on site.  He said they had mile-long pipes.  And a giant fucking two-story high cement building that they're pretty much putting over the leak. 
[01:08:30]  Right.  Yeah, 100 tons they said it weighed.  Yeah, where are we at with this leak?  The map doesn't look good, man.  They got one of the small ones.  I think they're getting that under control with this thing.  What they do is they lower down a big hose, and on the end of this hose is this giant cement, like a building.  It's pretty much a building that they put over the leak, and then it leaks into this thing, up into the hose,  and they pump it onto a ship. 
[01:09:00]  How the fuck do they figure that out?  And how long is that going to take?  It's ingenuity.  Until they can fix the fucking leak, at least it'll keep the oil from...  How much oil could escape from this thing?  Endless?  I've heard so many different amounts, but it's a lot.  Yeah.  It's just a lot.  The guy from BP said they had no idea how much was leaking.  Yeah, they really can't tell at this point how much is leaking.  And this is just going to...  Is this going to just destroy that whole area?  No.  You don't think so?  You know what? 
[01:09:30]  When the Exxon Valdez went, people were like, this is an event that for generations and generations  to come is going to affect it.  And you can't even tell anything happened up there.  Is there crystal clear water again?  Beautiful.  Pristine.  Gotta go up there.  It happens.  The sun breaks down oil, by the way.  So if it's on the surface, the sun does break it down.  Break down.  But it takes a while.  And they're worried about the marshlands and stuff. 
[01:10:00]  Shit.  Because I think a quarter of the nation's marshlands are down there.  Jesus.  But who cares about marshlands?  Exactly.  What are you doing?  What's happening in a marsh?  Whenever you come across a marsh, you're just like, ugh, it's a marsh.  I can't do anything with it.  Can't build on it.  Ever been in one of those boats with the big fans?  The fan boat?  And fly around the marshes?  I just saw those on Gentle Ben.  On the show Gentle Ben.  Look at a few gators.  You get to see some gators.  I don't want to go on a fan boat.  And your hair just blows around. 
[01:10:30]  It's nice.  It's all loud.  It's nice.  There's some hillbilly with three teeth with a stick in his hand steering you around.  Get out of here.  I don't need that.  Why, man?  It's an adventure.  I don't need that.  You need some adventures.  I get enough adventure.  You need some different adventures, though.  I don't need enough adventure in my life.  You need a different adventure.  Yeah?  You think a fan boat will do it?  I don't know.  It's up to you.  Some fucking redneck.  Look at that.  I think it'd be fun to drive one of those things.  Fuck yeah.  It's almost like flying on the water.  You got a stick in your hand, a propeller behind you. 
[01:11:00]  You wouldn't go on one of those?  No!  And then do some noodling?  I got no noodling.  Let's go noodle.  How about some canoodling?  Yeah.  I got no reason to go down into a marshy fucking swamp with a swamp boat.  What would it take for you to go noodling?  I would never go noodling.  What would it take, though?  Could you be completely fucked up on, I don't know, booze, pot, something?  Is there something that could happen to make you put your arm in those holes? 
[01:11:30]  Nothing I can conceive of that would make me...  The thought of putting your hand in a hole underwater so something can bite you and you  pull it up is something that horrifies me.  I don't like being surprised by anything like that.  I don't even like going in the water, low tide...  No, there's monsters.  ...up to my knees.  They hurt, yeah.  I'm scared that I'm going to be stepping on something that's fucking...  I'm petrified of a rock or a piece of seaweed. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, yeah.  When a piece of seaweed brushes on your leg in the water and you go,  And you just run out of the water like a maniac.  I'm that guy, too, man.  That's me.  No noodling.  I'm that guy.  I need water shoes.  On a fucking boat with a hook in the water.  That's how I fish.  Do you have water shoes?  Not like the...  Yeah.  Scuba booties.  Do you really?  I put on scuba booties.  I haven't made that step yet, but I think I'm going to this year.  Those are great when you go to a beach that has like... 
[01:12:30]  Sometimes you end up on a beach and...  Because I take a lot of cruises.  You go to a lot of different beaches and sometimes it's like powdered sugar, the sand.  Oh, yeah.  It feels great.  And sometimes it's just a lot of rocks.  Right.  And you can...  You know, you're trying to step in the water.  You put on your little scuba booties.  Scuba booties.  And you can walk right out there.  No problem.  You want a guy with real info on the oil spill?  All right.  Tim in Maine.  Tim.  Hey.  I'm in Maine.  Good morning, boys. 
[01:13:00]  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, sir.  I called when Sully went down in the river, but I work down here now.  You know a little bit of everything, don't you?  Yes, I do.  Just like you, Anthony.  You're my hero.  I want to be like you when I get up.  Thank you.  Of course I am.  Anyway, here's what they got.  That pipe or hose you're talking about is actually in about 35 to 40-foot sections, and  they put it together, and they lower it straight down, and that thing they built, it's kind  of like a pyramid with like a 60-foot big steel section on it. 
[01:13:30]  What they're going to do is lower it down, stick it into the mud over the pipe, so that  way the oil has nowhere to go but up the pipe, and then they'll hook the pipe into it,  they'll suck it up to the ship, and then they'll process it there, throw the water over  the side, send the oil up to New York so you guys can have gasoline for your bus takes.  Isn't that wonderful?  That was like watching a school film.  That had all the interest of a school film the way you just needed.  I can send you some pictures if you want.  Or a film strip.  I wanted to get it across before you punched me out. 
[01:14:00]  I like the film strip, too.  Yeah.  It was like, and here is the oil platform in action.  Yep, yep.  And then you'd have to change it.  Somebody actually had to sit there and turn a little dial.  And wait for the beep.  And wait for the beep.  What about the teacher that A, didn't give a shit about what he was doing, or B, was too  hungover so it was always behind?  You're one behind.  And they're like, will you fucking at least make this match up for us?  Fucking film strips. 
[01:14:30]  We watched film strips, you bastards.  You don't know what we went through in school.  At least they taught us real history, though.  I'm kidding.  None of that revisionist crap we're talking about today.  You guys don't know shit.  I don't know who invented a traffic light, and I could give a flying fuck, or a wailing  fucking harpoon.  It's true, you don't pay attention to lights anyway.  What do you care?  More inconvenience.  Let's go to Adam.  Adam, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I was listening to you talking about how you guys hate water, low tide, and whatnot. 
[01:15:00]  I've been surfing my entire life.  I live up in Southern Jersey.  Man.  If you take that surfboard out from under me, I will not touch the water.  I won't go in over my weight.  Really?  But you'll get on a surfboard, and what if you wipe out man like Greg Brady?  It's the funniest thing.  When I first went, I took my girlfriend.  She was watching me.  She said, I look like an idiot in the water. 
[01:15:30]  Once I fall off the board, I flail like a moron trying to find it.  See, that doesn't make sense to me because although I have done a little surfing in my life, I'm more of a boogie board guy, and that's scary to me when you're out over your head on a board because you're wondering about the sharks underneath you.  Yeah.  The entire time, I don't give a shit where I am.  I'm like, is there a fucking great white just looking up at my dumb board right now?  There's monsters under the water.  They're real live monsters. 
[01:16:00]  If anything in the water was walking around on land, you'd be like, ah, it would freak you out.  But just because they're in water, it's like, oh, that's not a monster?  Yeah.  I like having my feet on the sand while I'm in the water.  When I am on a board, I'm way more scared, so I don't get what you're getting at it.  Dangling your feet under there like fucking bait?  Exactly.  And when I got my dumb boogie board, it was kind of like a top-of-the-line one, but it was at the end of the season, and I could only get one with a white bottom. 
[01:16:30]  Is that bad?  Yeah.  With the white bottom on, yeah.  Is there a reason all the boards were left that had the white bottom?  Because they sold them where they were different colors, and I'm assuming the white bottom looks way too much like, what do they say?  Kind of looks like prey.  Like prey, like a seal or whatever they say.  Yeah, the belly of something that is delicious.  So I need to know from an expert surfer out there if that's bad or not.  And I guess you're not that guy, Adam.  Jesus Christ, I was setting you up.  Thank you.  All right, let's go back to the weather guy. 
[01:17:00]  Relatively queer, he said?  Yeah.  Here's the full forecast he did.  He couldn't help himself.  Now, you can see over the region not much activity going on.  Relatively queer.  And it looks like we're going to continue to see some chances for some showers moving in from the northwest as we get into tomorrow afternoon.  Here's what it looks like as far as those temperatures coming through for that cold from pushing through.  It looks like we're going to see those showers and maybe a chance for a pop-up shower or thunderstorm as we get into the afternoon. 
[01:17:30]  Right around 1 o'clock, looking at a chance for that rain popping up.  So take an umbrella with you as you get into the afternoon hours.  And we clear out on Friday with better conditions but cooler air as that front moves in.  And another chance for rain will come late on Friday night into Saturday morning as those temperatures fall.  Looking at 72 in Baltimore, 72 in Washington.  Looking at 63.  I don't know.  I have the giggles.  Look at that, 63 in Oakland.  And it looks like we are going to continue to see that cooler air building from the northwest.  Those thunderstorms moving along the cold front that are going to continue to push into our region. 
[01:18:00]  And you can see how those showers and thunderstorms are popping up across parts of Ohio into northern portions of Pennsylvania into New York State,  stretching all the way down in southern portions of Indiana.  So by tomorrow afternoon, I would say take those umbrellas with you as that chance will happen through the afternoon hours.  But tonight, looking at clear conditions, temperatures right around 71 degrees points out of the south at 5 to 10,  it looks like for tomorrow, we'll see plenty of sunshine, 82 degrees.  And then by tomorrow, it's really hard to get through this, 79 on Friday, a chance for some showers on Friday night into Saturday morning. 
[01:18:30]  And then Sunday, Mother's Day looks pretty good at 64.  And then Monday, looking at 65.  I'm just going to send it back to you guys.  He just couldn't get through it.  He's cracking himself up.  I said queer.  People like, not people, this guy, I should give him credit, Alex at LSU.  If you really want to know why noodling is scary, why noodling is scary, look up alligator snapping turtles. 
[01:19:00]  What?  Those things like to take off body parts.  So you're going in hoping for what?  It's catfish, right?  A catfish.  So you put your whole fucking arm in one of those fucking holes?  Yeah.  And you're hoping for a catfish, but you could run into an alligator snapping turtle?  Yeah.  Who needs that?  Get the fuck out of it.  Look at this fucking thing.  Ah!  What is that?  Is that a real fucking animal? 
[01:19:30]  That is amazing.  You could come across one of these?  Whoa.  You might want to Google image alligator snapping turtle today.  That is a dinosaur.  Yeah, absolutely.  That has nothing to, that has no business being in this century.  Or this era.  You know what?  Why don't we do the bit?  What's the bit?  What has no business being in this century?  That!  Well, is there any more things like that? 
[01:20:00]  Look at that dumb hillbilly laughing.  What is that?  He's just giggling.  That's the alligator snapping turtle.  Snapping turtle.  That thing will snap your fucking leg off.  Yeah, it takes off body parts, they're saying.  Do they get bitten by that when they noodle?  Yeah, that's what we were just saying.  You put your arm in a hole, and instead of getting a catfish, one of these might be hanging in there.  And they like to take off body parts.  Look at the fucking, I know it's radio, I'm sorry, but you can play along at home.  That's prehistoric.  Look at the fucking jaw. 
[01:20:30]  What is that?  Wow.  It has like two horns.  One on the top, one on the bottom, and then teeth in the middle, right?  That is something.  It looks like it's floating in the water.  That's why it looks like a rock in the water with little moss and stuff growing on it.  Would you be miserable if you stepped on that by accident, thinking it was a rock?  That's prehistoric.  Would you be sad?  It's prehistoric.  What else isn't from this century, or what was your life?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It has no business being in this era.  No business being in this era. 
[01:21:00]  The Komodo Dragon.  No business being in this.  It is not an ounce of business being in this fucking time zone.  It fucking, it somehow got around extinction.  Well, that's what we're talking about today.  Things that dodged extinction.  Whoop.  Yeah.  All right.  We add Komodo Dragon to the list with the alligator snapping turtle.  Here's the picture I'm looking at right now.  There's a Komodo Dragon on its hind legs, standing, standing.  Is it taking a bird out of the sky? 
[01:21:30]  And it looks like it's eating some type of animal out of a tree, but it's standing up.  Yeah, decide, I can stand, too.  And it's bigger than a person standing there.  That should not be on this planet.  Let me say hi as we try to figure out more things that should have been extinct.  Todd in Jersey.  Todd.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Back to the weather, man.  Check it out.  I have Danny bring it up on YouTube. 
[01:22:00]  There's a weatherman actually fighting, shitting on national TV where he actually, he blows  into some diarrhea during the cast.  Well, we've seen just about every weatherman freaking out over cockroaches and all sorts  of shit.  I don't know if I've seen that one.  We'll have to look for it.  Yeah, check it out.  Watch it out.  Could you help us out with the search or just say?  Yeah, just go on YouTube.  Do weatherman diarrhea.  Weatherman diarrhea?  Weatherman diarrhea.  Are you sure it's a guy?  Because I remember seeing a girl.  The audio's great. 
[01:22:30]  He's just trembling as he's going through it.  And is it, Danny asked you, it's definitely a guy, not a girl?  Definitely a guy.  All right.  All right.  We'll check that out.  We got too much going on because now we've got to look up some of these animals in.  They're fucking horrible.  What do you want to do first?  You want to try the weatherman thing and then we'll go back?  Yeah.  That's fine.  Yeah.  We'll collect up some.  We're great at multitasking on this show.  News blooper.  Weatherman goes diarrhea on air.  We've never seen this one.  I thought we'd see all of them.  All right.  That's the volume. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  Danny just hit here.  Before we get to the seven-day planner, 50 degrees outside.  Winds are out of the northwest, 7 miles per hour.  Humidity, 24%.  Dew point, 16 degrees.  Barometer, 30.06.  Almanac, today's high, 72 degrees.  It felt a little bit warmer today than 72, but that's where we were at.  That's where it felt a little warmer.  It's tense.  69, below, 45.  Sunrise, 648.  Sunset, 432. 
[01:23:30]  Not a lot going on here.  You can see pretty clear, a lot of high pressure moving through our area.  You can see he's hurting.  Yeah.  You can see he's hurting.  A few high clouds have moved in.  He's very distracted.  Nothing of significance.  He's about to have a mudslide in his pants.  Top of the radar, you can see lots of precipitation.  And he's walking around a lot.  He's moving a lot.  A little bit in the Pacific Northwest, but things are looking fairly good.  Oh, my God.  We're having a little bit.  Christmas, lots of snow and snow.  We need conditions on the Pacific Northwest.  Oh, excuse me.  We've got to go to break. 
[01:24:00]  Okay.  Oh, my God.  He was doing, like, the pee-pee dance.  He couldn't deal with it.  He was doing, like, a dance.  Back and forth, back and forth, walking, and holding his stomach when he walked off.  Wow, did he have to shit.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that's more of a visual, but it's pretty good.  Yeah, he was just...  He was very distracted.  He was heightened.  Very distracted.  Oh, this is fake.  Fake.  Don't even fucking play it. 
[01:24:30]  It drives me nuts.  The reported diarrhea thing.  Yeah.  It's so fucking fake.  Diarrhea fail.  You can play it if you want.  Is it?  It's in a different language.  Oh, it is?  Okay.  So it doesn't matter.  It's a reporter interviewing somebody, whatever.  It's a nice-looking woman.  She has white pants on.  Of course.  What a coincidence.  And then all of a sudden, she makes the symbol of, holy shit, I just shit my pants.  Look.  She holds her backside, and now she runs away, and there's going to be a brown stain on her  white pants. 
[01:25:00]  This thing is so fucking fake, and it's sent to me all the time.  Look at that.  Come on.  Yeah.  Come on.  Don't be that stupid.  Notice how his head turns just as the last fart starts.  Are they basically trying to prove that it's fake?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  Everybody thinks every video is fake, so...  No, that one's definitely fake.  I don't know.  Yeah, no, it's real.  I like that one.  Oh, you don't think it's fake?  Corey told me.  I don't know.  I mean, it could be, but, you know...  Is it plausible, Danny?  It's definitely plausible.  I'm going to go plausible. 
[01:25:30]  Wow.  Plausible.  Wow, really?  Well, you know why?  Because it's just...  Because usually you're, like, the first one to go.  Well, because you can usually tell because, like, the production value is, like, too much.  And, like, that was just a real simple, simple thing.  And, like, it wasn't overdone.  It was completely, you know...  Wow, I thought you were with me.  Nah, man.  You think it might be real?  I think so.  Let me say, I think that she would have backed away or sidestepped away,  and not shown her back.  Yeah, they needed to show the shot of her fucking brown stain and her white pants.  That's true. 
[01:26:00]  Can we hear it?  How long is it?  A woman would definitely back away because she would be mortified.  I'll submit in 20 minutes.  Yeah, and it's, like, not much.  Yeah, all right.  Wow, okay.  I would like to know what other people think, if that one's fake or real.  Danny, look up C.  I've got to really spell this whole thing out.  Going with Anthony's a little bit there.  U-N-T.  There you go.  Oh, look who comes up.  C-O-E-L-A-C-A-N-T-H. 
[01:26:30]  Thank you, Kevin, from Connecticut.  This thing should have been extinct.  Oh, yeah, that's a prehistoric fish.  Fish are weird, though.  Like, all right.  You know, everything down there is fucked up.  Their environment hasn't changed in 20 million years.  Yeah, you know what?  That's a fish.  Yeah, fish you've got to kind of almost give a break to.  But the fish that walk out of water, okay, what the fuck is that about?  Yeah, that's a little fucked up.  Those things should have been extinct fucking a long time ago.  You got one?  Yeah. 
[01:27:00]  The mud skipper.  Oh, the mud skipper?  Yeah, these things are fucking.  I got one.  The, the.  See, the.  It has no business being in this millennium.  I think you're tired for doing Hannity last night.  What?  Because as soon as this bit started, I thought you were going to go there.  Really?  I'm like, why is he taking so long?  No, I was just looking at that.  Why are you taking so long?  I just think if you look at the, it has no reason to be on the same, you know, planet. 
[01:27:30]  I was going to ask Kenny to take your temperature because I'm like, why is he waiting so long?  It should have been extinct.  What about the armadillo?  Hmm.  Yeah, armadillos are kind of armor plated like that.  There's no business.  They got no business being here either.  You're right.  Armadillo.  Sam's dad is coming up.  That's Sam's dad with his handlebar mustache.  Is that a cuttlefish? 
[01:28:00]  A mud skipper just decides to come out of a hole.  Well, yeah, that's what they do.  They, they burrow in like the wet sand.  That has no, no business being here on this fucking planet.  That's like, we're watching evolution basically.  Look at his blinking with his dumb eyes.  What is that dumb eye doing?  Oh God.  What blue eyes that thing has.  And then it uses its fins to walk around.  That's, that's what was all over the earth for a while.  Just, hey, a few billion years and we'll, we'll fucking invent shit. 
[01:28:30]  Not a lot of time goes by and all of a sudden you're all walking around with iPhones and blackberries and stuff.  Yeah.  You know.  Hello?  Would you pet a mud skipper?  I'm a mud skipper.  No.  Look, it has to constantly make sure it has mud on it.  Yeah, it's rolling around in the mud.  Lest it dry off and die.  God forbid it dries off a little bit.  It walks three steps and has to roll around again.  It's sucking up the mud.  What is it eating?  Why is it out of the water? 
[01:29:00]  I don't know.  Get back in the water.  What's it doing?  It's disgusting.  It's cleaning out.  It's, well, because what they do is they, when they dig, they actually scoop huge chunks  of, of the earth into their mouth and excavate a nest for themselves.  Yeah.  So they're, they're constantly, they're constantly digging out their nest because it keeps getting,  it keeps getting flooded.  Why, why is it, why is he, uh, jumping in the air and why is his fucking, he's trying  to signal for a meat.  A meat?  A meat.  They want to fuck?  Yeah.  A meat?  Everything wants to fuck. 
[01:29:30]  What do the crabs do?  Crabs are looking like, I want to eat that motherfucker.  All right, what, what, what, is it?  A fish?  Is it, what is it?  It's jumping out with fucking, it's flying.  What is it?  It's a mudskipper.  Ah!  Does it live in mud, water, or on land?  Would you pet a mudskipper?  It's like a fucking unclipped cock.  Oh, look, they're fighting now.  Oh, wow, the mudskipper fight.  How big are they?  Do they like people to pet them?  Oh, look at them, they're like, ah!  Probably about six inches.  Their mouths are open and they're, and they're just biting each other.  They're just dummies.  Would you put your penis in that?  I'd love to fuck the mouth of a mudskipper. 
[01:30:00]  Wouldn't it be great?  And the crabs aren't even fucking with them.  The crabs are just looking at them.  When it opens the mouth, it's kind of invited.  Yeah.  Would you put your hard penis in that?  You big mouth mudskipper.  How far in do you think you could get it?  Wait, what'd the crab do?  Did the crab fucking eat them or what?  The crab's just looking.  Ah, the crab doesn't have a fucking chance.  So what do you want from me?  Crab in the middle?  Boy, that life was great.  Yeah.  There was another one that came up, and I can't fucking remember.  Oh, camel spiders are fucked up.  Yeah, yeah, spiders, there are certain insects that have no business being around. 
[01:30:30]  The praying mantis is just an odd fucking thing.  You see them every so often.  Every time I see one of those fuckers, I stomp them out.  It's illegal.  You could be arrested for killing a praying mantis.  I fucking stomp them out.  Get off of my curb.  No, I'm not leaving.  It's government's property.  Get off my curb.  Government's property.  Government property.  A dick.  I'm on government property.  I'm standing on your curb.  You're in front of my house.  You're on my lawn.  No, I'm not.  I'm not touching your grass.  Government property. 
[01:31:00]  That was like the kid fucking thing to use.  But was that you?  No, I was the...  Guy trying to get on the curb?  No, I was the get off my property.  And there was a dopey kid that would always go, government property, government property.  How bad did you want to have a gun at that point in your life?  I wanted to kill government property, kid.  Camel spider.  Danny, on instant feedback, I don't know, maybe it's worth it.  This guy, the address is way too long.  It says, 10 horrible deep sea creatures. 
[01:31:30]  Thank you, Greg and Tony from Hawpog.  Greg and Tony.  Hawpog.  But deep sea creatures are just...  That's just another fucking world, man.  The one with the lights on their head and you bring them up and their eyeballs pop out  because the pressure's too...  Like they're used to the pressure of being at 35,000 feet underwater.  And the whale shark definitely should make that list.  That thing is fucked up.  You ever seen a whale shark?  They're pretty big.  Pretty fucking big, Anthony.  A basking shark.  Huh?  Oof. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, look at these things.  They are.  Deep sea fish are just silly.  They have all kinds of shit.  They've got too much stuff on them.  They've got to be equipped to be down there.  What's all that stuff for?  You know something?  I'll go simple.  The jellyfish.  Get the fuck off the planet.  You're stupid.  It's a jelly.  It's not a fish and it's not jelly.  And it can't really move on its own.  It's just got to wait for someone to like push water at it so it can move around.  It pumps fucking water in and out of it and stings you. 
[01:32:30]  What kind of primitive life form is that?  I don't know.  How do they fuck?  I don't even know.  The slightest thing about the jellyfish is that the jellyfish ever gets his cock sucked.  No.  By a porpoise.  Never.  Never.  You think porpoise loves fucking sucking jellyfish?  They have to.  They are quite stunning when they're.  We haven't discovered it yet in the jellyfish because they don't really have much of a brain  or nervous system.  It's just praying that someone will discover that the porpoises are just sucking their  cocks constantly.  That thing isn't thinking. 
[01:33:00]  That thing's just like there for no reason but to ruin your day of swimming.  And what I guess would be considered some kind of a brain-ish thing is like one of those  what is it where you put your hands on the big ball the electricity like kind of.  Oh yeah yeah like a plasma ball or something.  Thank you yeah that's what they're fucking.  That's what they look like.  That's what they look like.  I am Sargon.  Cave crickets.  Cave cricket?  My brother's infested I think with cave crickets.  Isn't that what they call. 
[01:33:30]  Oh no that's a different one.  Yeah my brother is infested with these fucking things.  What?  How do you get rid of them?  What's wrong with your brothers in this infestation?  What happened?  How are the bees?  Oh you don't want to know.  What happened?  What happened?  You don't want to know.  I kind of do.  I think he's mailing us the nest.  Oh really?  Oh he took it out?  Yeah there's no real.  What was the casualty?  There's really no good ending.  I guess this is a better time than any.  We were trying to film a follow-up video to the big wasp nest video that we did. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  Turns out the winter killed them all.  I did.  The winter got them?  Yeah.  And he's mailing us the nest.  Are they dead?  So we can have it in the studio.  Or dormant?  Dead.  Are you sure?  Oh yeah.  Let me tell you something.  He got it out easy.  Those things can be tricky.  They could go dormant on you.  I wish I had a better story for everybody.  And then they come back to life.  The whole wasp nest saga is a bust.  He got the whole nest out.  There's no dug in little canals that he's got to get to?  He usually listens.  Maybe he could call us.  I never gave him the hotline because I don't think he does good radio. 
[01:34:30]  The first day...  I'm fucking with you, Scott.  Call us, though, because these guys need to know the wasp nest story.  The first nice day we had just the other day, after all that rain and kind of cold weather  and everything, bees just decided they're going to start building nests on my house.  Oh, sorry.  I'm like, get the fuck...  So what did you do?  First nice day...  Oh, I killed the shit out of them.  Do you got holes in your house now?  No, no, no.  It's like they go under the brick...  No, I mean, you know, because you take care of them with... 
[01:35:00]  Oh, no, I didn't take care of them with a heater.  Oh, okay.  I didn't use my heater on them.  My rod.  No, I just smack them with stuff.  And then I take whatever mud they put on to try to anchor their little paper nest.  It all starts with just a little bit of mud.  A little dab will do you.  They put a little mud there, and before you know it, you got this big hanging fucking pumpkin of bees.  And I got rid of that.  And it smashed the bees.  Smash them on the ground.  And I'm scared.  I'm very scared to have a can of anything out on my table when the weather's nice outside. 
[01:35:30]  Because I'm petrified.  A bee is going to fly in there, and then I'm going to drink it.  Okay, I'm soda.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That is something...  That is a great fear of mine.  Dude, I think I told a story.  I got stung in the early fall.  Yeah.  I forget how much of a fucking nightmare that is.  It just hurts.  It just sucks.  It swells up.  It's like, all right, sting me, but fucking you and your poison. 
[01:36:00]  It just sucks when you get stung.  Pwned.  One stupid yellow jacket, too.  Yeah.  It wasn't even a lot of them.  It wasn't a hornet.  I know.  No.  Get over it.  Blah, blah.  Say what you want.  But it just sucks to get stung.  I've never been a fan of the bee sting of any sort.  I think Anthony was molested.  Yeah?  The fear?  No.  I do have a lot of fear.  You don't want to put it to your mouth, and you don't want the bee to fly in your mouth.  You think that represents a cock and release the poison?  Yeah.  The poison?  Yeah.  On your tongue?  Yeah.  There's a stinger that goes in your mouth, and then there's poison. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, you might be right.  Yeah.  And it flies in and out of your mouth at a high velocity?  Yeah.  In and out.  In and out.  Keeps going.  While big bee hands hold your little head.  Steady.  Another bee's pushing the back of my head.  Uh, platypus.  No.  Platypus.  Goliath tigerfish.  Big ass fish with huge fucking teeth.  Can we take a look at, thank you, Brad, in Atlanta.  Goliath tigerfish.  Oh, that doesn't sound good.  Goliath tigerfish.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[01:37:00]  It's got a big mouth.  Yuck.  What the fuck?  It looks like a piranha.  That is a nasty looking fish.  What does it need those teeth for?  Not to fucking bite us on the ankles.  What does it need those teeth for?  What are you doing with that?  It's not eating.  Oh, my God.  Look at this.  A bunch of **** holding the thing.  Jesus.  Damn.  They must be good eating down south.  That is a fucking nasty toothed animal.  Yeah, and the fish is really ugly, too.  You're okay.  Hey, you know. 
[01:37:30]  You're okay.  Ah, shit.  Yeah, flying fish that jump out of the water and have wings where they can fly about 100 feet.  They should have been gone.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Flying fish.  What are you?  Bird or fish?  Come on.  Come on.  They just discovered a jelly...  Wait, what is this?  Allen in Jersey.  Allen.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Al.  I will.  Speak.  You're on the air.  Are you panicking? 
[01:38:00]  You all right?  Are you freaking out?  Because you're on the air?  Is it freaking you out a little bit?  You don't know what to say?  Allen?  Allen?  Allen?  Allen, you all right?  Allen, did you die?  He's still there.  Allen?  Allen?  Allen?  Don't be nervous, man.  It's a couple countries and, you know, spread out throughout the whole world.  We have listeners.  Are you just embarrassed?  Not a lot, but they're all over the place.  It's the beginning of your call, went a little awry.  Are you embarrassed a little bit?  Allen?  You could snap back.  He's still there. 
[01:38:30]  Allen?  Allen?  Imagine he's just sitting on the other end of his phone, fucking...  Sweating.  Clutching his chest.  I don't know what to say.  Trying to make it to a fucking exit.  I don't know what to say.  Allen?  You all right?  We need to know you're all right.  Wow, that's some choppy water.  Why are they flying?  Because they're flying fish.  Which is the dumbest thing.  Why are they doing it?  Why when you can just stay in the water?  There's nothing in the water.  I might be wrong, but I think it's to get away from predators.  Predators?  Oh, really?  Predators.  Where the fuck is...  Come on, do it. 
[01:39:00]  Where do they live?  Water.  And air.  No, I know, but what part of the world?  Ocean.  Oh.  What part?  The ocean part.  I've been in the ocean.  The ocean part.  Go to the piranha test bite.  Bite test.  Oh.  Oh.  Holy shit.  Get the fuck out of here.  That would be your finger.  This guy has a piranha in it, and it tried to get his finger in his hand.  It's out of the water.  And then he put a stick in the piranha's mouth, and the piranha just bit the stick right in  half, and then went to turn its head to bite the guy's finger. 
[01:39:30]  You know what that would do to your cock?  Oh, would that feel great?  I mean, horrible.  Allen?  Allen's still there.  I don't know what happened to Allen.  Allen.  I hope you're all right.  Where are you?  I'm going to keep Allen on hold.  We'll keep checking back.  Yeah, check back with Allen.  You want to say that they just discovered a jellyfish that is immortal.  What?  Yeah, that's why I want to talk to Allen.  It lives forever and ever and ever?  What's a pangolin, I think?  P-A-N-G-O-L-I-N?  Hmm.  Kind of looks like an armadillo, but with huge spikes. 
[01:40:00]  That sounds scary.  Yeah.  Oh, my.  Oh, God.  It's a piranha chasing a goldfish around in a fish tank.  Oh.  And that goldfish is swimming for its dear life, and it's going to fail miserably.  It's just the piranha.  There goes the piranha.  It just got it.  Oh, boy.  By the belly.  You know, the animal kingdom is very cruel.  Oh, it just bit it in half.  And look, it's still going, it's still sucking air, thinking it's going to be okay.  Well, the belly's the best part, right? 
[01:40:30]  You're going to be okay.  Say the fucking words.  No.  No, I don't think he's going to be okay now.  Look at the fish.  The piranha's eating it from the back end.  Instead of just eating its head.  What a fucking cruel motherfucker this piranha is.  And fish just, you bite them in half, and they just, still their lips keep moving like,  boop, boop, like, I'm breathing.  I'm okay.  They just don't even know when they're dying.  You think they feel that?  Oh, yeah.  He's got to feel that.  You think?  Yeah.  Probably.  He's bitten in half.  Yeah.  Danny, go to, I'm going to try this one. 
[01:41:00]  U-R-O.  An ass.  U-R-O.  M-A-S-T-I-X.  An X in there.  That would be a good Scrabble word.  No shit.  Use of the X.  Nah.  It's a big fucking...  No big deal?  It's a lizard.  No big deal on that one?  It's a goddamn lizard.  It's one of those lizards that look like the same from the front and the back.  That's pretty cool looking.  Oh, that's all that is?  That's dinosaur-ish.  Nah.  I used to be so into fucking lizards when I was a kid. 
[01:41:30]  I had lizards, brought them back from California, and my dad sent me an iguana for my birthday  when I was a little crybaby kid.  He sent me an iguana, and apparently iguanas get ticks.  I didn't know this.  What?  Nervous, you mean?  No, not a little twitchy iguana.  His little legs keep lifting.  Yeah, but because my dad knew I liked lizards, but I liked, you know, little lizards and 
[01:42:00]  a little terrarium, and you feed them mealworms and shit like that.  So he decides, you know, probably on a bender to get me a giant fucking iguana, and he sends  this thing from California to New York in a cooler.  It's like in a fucking cooler.  So I get the thing.  I'm wondering what it is.  As I open it up, my mother goes, oh, Jesus Christ, she's freaking out, and then I see  it, and I'm like, oh, it's a giant iguana.  Let me, like, put it, take it out, and I saw a tick on it, and I was like, someone's 
[01:42:30]  got to get the tick off.  I was just crying because it had a tick on it.  My brother called me a pussy and took the tick off.  Wait, did they get them in the house or just outdoors?  I guess it had, you know, from the outdoors, it had a tick on it.  You just pulled the fucking tick out.  Yeah, it looked like the iguana had a skin tag.  How long did you have the iguana for?  Not long.  Really?  Yeah, because I was all crying about it because it scared me, and my mother was like, ah, 
[01:43:00]  well, get rid of it.  Stupid.  Why are all this crying?  Joey, what's wrong with you?  Send them an iguana.  Out of all of us, you cried the least.  I was a sensitive child.  But as a kid, you cried the most often.  I got all my crying out of my system.  Now I just don't care about anything.  Dan, how about a alligator gar?  What are you looking at?  Alligator.  Coconut crab?  Oh, my God.  Well, coconut's delicious.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Let's take a look at the coconut crab.  I hear the...  It's got a lot of coconut crabs. 
[01:43:30]  Jesus.  I'm finding it funny today, though, for some reason.  Yeah, I know.  I don't know why.  I just love it.  What is that thing?  Ah!  Oh, my God!  It looks like a head crab from fucking Half-Life.  That's giant.  That is horrid.  Where do those live, Dan?  I don't know, but I don't want to live there.  I would guess Hawaii.  I'm going to go with Hawaii.  You're going to go with Hawaii?  How big is that?  It's as big as a garbage pail or half a garbage pail.  It's climbing a palm tree.  It's not even near the water. 
[01:44:00]  What is it doing?  It's the size...  It was wrapping...  It's hugging the whole palm tree.  That's what you got to tell the people.  It's not just climbing it.  It's just...  It's hugging it.  Dude, it was wrapped around the garbage can.  Yeah.  Why would these kids hold it?  Because look at him.  He's a...  Oh, you know.  But he was.  You know what that also looks like?  Aliens.  The thing that got on that guy's face.  Right.  Do they bite people?  I'm sure it would if you fucked with it.  God, that's frightening.  Coconut crab. 
[01:44:30]  How about...  No part of the coconut crab.  You want to move on or we...  You got something about to play here?  He's looking for a coconut crab.  I'm so sick of fucking ads on the internet.  I know.  It's annoying.  Jesus.  Oh, Steve.  Oh, God.  That's fucking dumb Steve-O.  Steve-O wearing coconuts on his tits.  No.  There's only one type of crabs I know about.  The reason why they're called coconut crabs is because their pinchers are so powerful that  they can cut through coconuts.  What? 
[01:45:00]  This guy's so mean looking.  Look at the size of that.  Steve-O is going to put his nipple in his claw?  Is that what he's doing?  He's wearing it like a bra.  Oh.  He's got a coconut.  He's taunting it.  And he's putting his fucking...  I wonder what it could do to my butt cheek.  He's going to let it...  Wow!  Why would they do this?  These guys are so strong.  He's going to let it clamp onto his ass cheek?  They're all on the side of a rock.  Fuck, that thing is big and nasty. 
[01:45:30]  He can just...  Would you allow coconut crab to grab your ass cheek?  No!  Oh, he's only got my underwear.  It's got his underwear.  Steve-O.  He's nuts.  Steve-O's fucked up.  It's hanging on his underwear.  Now it's biting his...  It's clawing his ass.  Good God!  It's crawling on him.  It's gripped his ass.  It won't let go of his ass. 
[01:46:00]  He's grabbed his ass.  He's holding his cock so the crab can't get his...  Can't get his cock.  He's got to use pliers or something to get it off of his ass.  Holy shit.  Wow, that coconut crab is not playing games.  It doesn't want to let go.  I would never help him, would you?  No.  You've got to hold that.  Oh, my God!  Oh, they're now in a panic trying to get this thing off his ass. 
[01:46:30]  He's got like a multi-tool that he's using...  Like the jaws of life to open up the claw.  He's using a Leatherman to get this crab off of Steve-O's ass.  As soon as he gets one claw off another claw...  This is a nightmare.  He's got six guys pulling a crab off his hiney.  God damn it.  God damn it.  Holy shit!  This skin is so over.  This skin is so over. 
[01:47:00]  And that coconut crab just went back to his house.  Dude, you know what?  Steve-O, biggest balls ever.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you've got to give it to him.  I don't even know who's in second place.  He had claw marks on his ass that were like...  Like deep.  Yeah.  Deep.  Oh, my God.  Can you imagine?  Like ripped.  Like it ripped his ass.  I'd have to go back to look at it, but it did look like it wasn't just like a pinch.  It looked like it was...  Yeah, like it was torn.  He was digging in.  No, that's a fucking claw mark.  That's sick.  I would hate to have a crab claw my hiney. 
[01:47:30]  Could you look up...  I hope Kevin's not fun with me.  A-Y-E, A-Y-E.  A-Y-E.  Yeah.  A-Y-E.  It's going to be the skipper.  Yeah.  A-Y-E.  I just want to make sure we spelled it right.  That's all.  Coconut crabs are fucking disturbing.  Get the fuck out of here.  Is it one word or two?  This is it.  Yeah, this is it.  Oh, it's like some kind of a rat, bat, monkey looking thing.  It looks like one of those ugly dogs.  You know what I mean?  Looks like Voss.  You know the ugly dog competition they have every year? 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Looks like that.  Like a hairless.  With fucking huge ears.  Bat-like.  Yeah, very bat looking.  Hey, can you eat coconut crabs?  You want to fucking try to catch them?  I wonder if they're delicious.  I bet you they taste all right.  King crabs will fuck you up and they're pretty tasty.  Are they big?  Oh, God, they're giant.  Bigger than coconut crabs?  King crabs are bigger.  Yeah, they got like a leg span of like five feet.  Really?  Those fucking things.  They're giant. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, yeah.  I would love to see that.  Yes.  There's a movie called Piranha 3D to trail it from Miramax if we want to see it.  I wonder if it's playing at the IMAX.  Wow, the aye-aye is fucking creepy, man.  Yeah, it looks like something that would attack you in the night.  I'm frightened.  Yeah, we've looked at scary animals.  We've educated you on frightening scary animals.  And a lot of these I don't think I've ever seen before.  No.  There's so many animals.  Could you do alligator guard real fast, too? 
[01:49:00]  Oh, we're doing this?  Okay, sorry.  Whatever you got on.  This is the Piranha trailer.  3D.  Looking at some type of Lake Victoria.  Oh, there seems to be a fault opening up in the bottom of Lake Victoria.  There's a man going for a dip.  Diver is going down.  Yeah.  Quake, open that up.  Now it's a connecting passage.  Descending fisher.  To where?  Oh, my God.  What?  It's at least 200 feet, Novak. 
[01:49:30]  Command.  Uh-uh-uh.  Ah.  Oh, boy.  Novak's in trouble, I think.  Novak's so fucked.  He's under a big underground cave that was opened up under the water.  And there's some kind of glowy thing.  Come to bit me!  Hey, what are you doing down there?  Get out.  It's a fish, you cunt.  Oh, shit.  They're all over.  Oh, my God.  They're all around him.  Oh, the piranhas just ate him.  From the hills have eyes.  Why don't you just stay out of the water?  That piranha. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  Can't get you.  Bad CGI.  That CGI was terrible.  Oh, no.  Is that Doc Brown?  Yeah, Doc Brown's in it.  There's us and his 20,000 kids.  Oh, my God.  Bing Reams is in it.  This thing's going to fucking blow.  I hope a piranha fucks him in the ass.  Ah, spring break.  Oh, yeah.  In a lake full of piranha.  Yes.  The shark has declared an emergency.  Those beaches will stay open. 
[01:50:30]  Hits the 4th of July.  Oh, this is terrible.  They're trying to do a Jaws thing with piranha.  What the fuck?  She got her asshole bitten out, see?  Bitter pussy.  Oh.  Now, that old joke.  Now we'll never get the smell out of those fish.  Everybody out!  Is he chopping up piranha with a weapon?  Wait, was that a...  That was not Richard Dreyfuss, was it?  It was?  Looking like Quint?  What is he doing?  Oh, what the fuck is this horse shit? 
[01:51:00]  It's bad CGI.  And Dreyfuss is playing like a Quint character.  Oh, no.  Oh, they stop and yell at you, the piranha, before they eat you.  Okay, that's what happens.  All right.  That looks horrible.  I bet that is going to get...  Oh, I'm sorry.  It looks great.  Miramax sending over a screener.  Get us screeners immediately.  Yeah, we need screeners for that.  So we can fucking get the shit out of this.  No, man. 
[01:51:30]  I'm pretty fucking far from okay.  I'm going to stand here with some...  Whatever, I forgot the chair.  Forgot the line.  I love when that happens to me so much.  I know.  Yeah.  God, that's terrible.  That looked terrible.  If the piranhas is chasing me, I'll probably get out some deadlifts and something.  Here you guys go.  What is that, Danny?  Chase book?  No, no.  What'd you...  No, nothing.  I don't have anything.  No, that. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, wow.  That's what I saw.  It's a big fishing.  I forget what it's called.  Hang on.  Looks like it's face...  A goliath grouper?  Grouper?  Yeah, the grouper.  Oh, the grouper.  You can see it.  Those are big.  Atlantis.  Yeah, you see them in the aquariums.  They're giant.  How about alligator gar, and then we'll move on.  We'll finally say goodbye to this.  Gar.  G-A-R.  Yeah, gar.  Oops.  That's Jim in Wisconsin.  Thank you, Jim.  No, that's Terry Gar.  She doesn't look good these days. 
[01:52:30]  She used to be very hot back in the 60s, mid to late 60s.  All right, look at this fucking thing.  All right, that's prehistoric.  Yeah, that's prehistoric.  It's got that flat, bill-like mouth.  Not, you know, hello, bill, not that type.  What is that, a shark?  Alligator gar.  Wow.  Yeah, it's got a mouth like an alligator on a fish.  On a fish!  That piranha thing is such a Jaws rip-off.  They're just trying to do Jaws with the fucking...  Well, Dreyfus looking like Quint. 
[01:53:00]  I know, that was stupid.  And what was he in, like a little rowboat or something?  With a motor?  And he was caught in a whirlpool.  Did you see the prehistoric shark they found?  No.  Google prehistoric shark.  Prehistoric shark.  Wow.  They found it?  I guess it still exists.  Yeah.  What's that sound?  I'm watching on my iPhone.  Oh.  It's a weird prehistoric shark.  Somebody sent me the image.  The video.  What is that?  What the hell is that?  What's going on?  It looks like it's smiling. 
[01:53:30]  Go to YouTube.  It's on the...  It's on the YouTube.  The YouTube?  I love when comedians act like they don't know pop culture.  Yeah.  Do you watch the YouTube?  We get your ironic little prehistoric shark captured on its film.  It's pretty and if you weren't expecting it to swim across your sideline, it's just a  little bit frightening.  You'd be bummed out if you were snorkeling and you saw that ant.  I would fucking freak out.  Wow.  But this is one of the rarest things ever to come from the bottom of the sea. 
[01:54:00]  It's a prehistoric shark which has been discovered alive in the ocean.  And it has better teeth than the English.  Of course we had to kill it.  Jesus.  Kill it.  How about you let it swim around a little bit?  Because they're Asians and they killed it.  Probably makes their penises hard or something.  Oh, yeah.  The remains of these frilled sharks in the Earth's lair that are 80 million years old.  Wow.  And it truly is.  And now you've killed it.  Great.  Oh, it might be alive.  It was laying on the dock.  Oh. 
[01:54:30]  It's alive.  It looked a little dry to be alive.  Coming up for sushi.  You eat its penis and you will have fertility for many years.  It looks like it's wounded because it has those reddish gills.  Yeah.  And its dumb mouth is open all the time.  And paper-like skin.  She's perhaps not the most beautiful species in the world, but she is indeed a truly woman.  Oh, they're swimming with it.  So I guess it's a bit dangerous.  It just looks scary.  Well, then you should have left it there. 
[01:55:00]  We will eat the gallbladder to make our penis bigger.  That's what happens when you take it out of the water.  I know.  It's a fish.  It's ancient and they pull it out and put it on a dock and talk to it.  You could survive out here, right?  I want to take a break.  Put it on some rice, wrap it in seaweed.  What a nonsense break.  I don't even know if it was fucking good. 
[01:55:30]  I love it.  It was educational.  This was like the Discovery Channel.  Opie and Anthony's Discovery Channel today.  Without the pictures.  That's smart.  We just talk, though.  People can play along at home if they have the YouTube.  I call it the YouTube, Jimmy.  Oh, it's the worst.  Do you watch the YouTubes?  Anyone, you know, got the Facebook?  Yeah.  You know, I just got on the Facebook and, boy, let me tell you.  It's like, you know it's not the Facebook.  I know.  Putting the in front of it.  Do you watch the MTV? 
[01:56:00]  What?  It's been around since 82.  Do you suck the cock?  Yes.  I'm a kneel-down comedian.  Two Jews walk into a bar.  A black Jew and it's in a bar.  A kneel-down comedian.  Yes. 
[01:56:30]  I'm checking the Twitter.  I'm checking the Twitter.  And a few people saying, we must check out the trailer for Human Centipede.  Yeah, this is like the biggest thing the past week.  I watched it this morning.  Yeah.  Is it dumb?  No, it's, I mean, it's a horror movie.  But I think it's the concept that people are, like, if I play the trailer for you, just be like, okay, whatever.  But it's the concept of the film.  It's not worth playing right now?  I don't know.  I mean, I could pull it up.  Let's just take a little look-see, and if we don't like it, we'll fucking smash Daniel. 
[01:57:00]  I trust you, Dan, if you don't think it's worth it.  No, I mean, it looks fun.  I'd like to go look.  Human Centipede?  Who's that?  He has to buy a thousand shoes.  Oh, Chip, he would have to.  Yes, um, I was wondering if I could get driving directions to a nightclub called...  Hello, sweetie.  No, we're in Germany right now.  Maybe we can talk to you later?  All right, we missed you.  Bye, Amy.  Bye, sweetie.  Acting is horrendous.  It's like porno acting.  I thought you knew exactly where we were going. 
[01:57:30]  The car breaks down.  What was that?  Black tire in the middle of nowhere.  We drive away.  We came from over here, I swear.  We just got a little lost.  Foundry music filmed.  Yes, we're not a little lost.  We're really lost.  Oh, can anyone help?  We got a black tire.  Can we come in?  Oh, nice.  Their makeup's all running.  Um, we're on a road trip through Europe. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  Can you call the emergency car service for us?  That guy looks so creepy.  Yeah, that guy's really creepy.  He's really creepy, but the acting around him sucks.  He's got a really lovely home.  Oh, shit.  A demented surgeon.  Oh.  Wild, wild, wild, whatever.  Wheeled on the instrument?  Yes, to perform the unspeakable.  Oh, my God, stop it.  He's linking people through their assholes and mouths? 
[01:58:30]  You start with cutting the ligaments of the kneecaps.  No conscience, no mercy, and no hope.  Oh, the cranky surgeon.  Yeah.  You need the help.  You're a sick man.  Oh, okay.  This is great.  Intervention. 
[01:59:00]  Ah, he's at the window.  He does look like a real creep.  He's trying to make a human centipede.  What is this?  What are you doing to us?  First sequence.  Nice.  There we go.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It's like Pacino.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, what he wants to do is take people and attach their faces to another person's ass 
[01:59:30]  and make the digestive tract just go clean through and link them all together and make  a giant human centipede.  I heard there's a digestion scene.  Is there?  That would not be feasible.  I don't think that would be feasible, no.  Dude, that guy was really creepy.  He was a creepy looking guy.  But, fuck, the acting around him sucked.  Really bad.  Got to buy a thousand pair of lifts.  Yeah. 
[02:00:00]  A lot of shoes.  Yeah.  And wigs for the asses.  Look, but don't crawl up the wall.  Oh, my God.  Who do you play in the film?  This is Richard Dreyfuss for that Piranha 3D.  Yeah.  Dreyfuss answers, is this real?  He goes, I play Matt Hooper.  No.  I play the older Matt Hooper who escaped being eaten by the shark and is now eaten by a bunch  of piranha fish.  No.  Way.  Was it an opportunity for you to bring some gravitas to something that might otherwise 
[02:00:30]  be superficial fun?  No.  It was an opportunity to get money into the initiative.  So, he did this film for money.  Money into the initiative.  Why did you take a role in Piranha 3D?  Was that a tribute to Jaws, Dreyfuss?  I had said no because I didn't want to make fun of my own career.  I was on the phone with Bob Weinstein.  Oh, it's a Bob Weinstein thing, huh? 
[02:01:00]  He's been really, really good to us.  Yeah.  And he said, we could give you a lot more money.  And I told him what I was involved in.  I was describing to him his idea of bringing civics back so that people understood their  own civic authority because if we're bound only by ideas and don't teach them, we're not  bound.  What is he saying?  It's some program I think he wants to start about civic responsibility.  What does that have to do with taking this?  And he interrupted and said, if it hadn't already been written, I would have said, you 
[02:01:30]  had me at civics.  He wrote a check that was this big to the initiative.  And I said, okay, I'll do the film.  Oh, so the guy gave, Weinstein gave him a lot of money for his initiative there?  Yes.  I got you.  But why does it say he's Dr. Gordon Raybanks?  Okay, I'll do the film.  And their names are going to be on the bottom of the website permanently.  But it says he's Dr. Gordon Raybanks.  I guess he's, maybe he thinks it's like an older Matt Hooper.  Like his opinion of it or? 
[02:02:00]  Oh, this is dumb.  Let's take a break.  I think that's fake.  You think that might be fake?  He wouldn't do that, would he?  Well, he did do Poseidon.  He looked ridiculous in the trailer.  Ridiculous.  And he was wearing the wool hat that Matt Hooper wore.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was wearing his same old wool hat.  Look at Jimmy.  That's embarrassing.  I have no idea.  Let's step aside.  We'll get into some new stuff in moments.

I got very good news for Anthony, and it's not his birthday. 
[02:04:30]  What?  Great news for you.  I didn't even tell you during the break.  What news?  TLC renewing Toddlers and Tiaras for a third season.  That's okay, but I'm not into Toddlers and Tiaras.  You're not?  No.  Turn off the music.  I'm...  What happened?  I'm more a Little Miss Perfect guy.  I enjoy the Little Miss Perfect show.  Why?  Because...  Aren't they the same show? 
[02:05:00]  No, no.  Little Miss Perfect has that faggy guy who sings the little song.  Mm-hmm.  Little Miss Perfect.  And he's, uh...  Boy, is he over-the-top gay.  Gee.  And they have the wow wear.  Now, the wow wear has to...  It's...  This is the time to wow the judges.  So dress like a little fucking whore, you six-year-old.  And, uh...  Yeah, they parade him around on stage and make him do, uh... 
[02:05:30]  Back bends and fucking...  You're describing Toddlers and Tiaras, no?  Yeah, yeah.  You know how it is.  It's like, uh...  Is it the same show?  It's like Hoarders and then Hoarders Buried Alive.  Or Intervention and Addiction.  You know, one channel has one, one's got the other, but it's the same show, basically.  Right.  That's pretty much what it is.  Okay.  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't know you were a big fan of the other one.  But I haven't really watched Toddlers and Tiaras.  I've only seen Little Miss Perfect because, um, it's hysterical.  Keeping, uh...  Keeping with this thought here, did you see the dance video? 
[02:06:00]  No.  Did you see it, Danny?  One of these, uh, one of these fuckers that follows me sent me a great video.  I think I know what you're talking about.  I should have saved it because I wasn't sure we were going to talk about it on the show,  and now we should talk about it on the show.  Some dance competition.  Yes, I am.  That's what I'm looking for now because I deleted it.  It's a viral video.  Oh, you had it too?  Yeah, it was on, it was on my, someone posted it on my Facebook wall, but I got rid of it  because it was just too inappropriate, I think.  It was really inappropriate.  It's like some big-time competition, you know, like a, like a, like a dance competition,  and it's sort of like cheerleaders, but they're like, how old are they? 
[02:06:30]  Like eight, maybe?  Dude, there was some, they looked a little even younger than that.  It looked like, like between six and eight.  And were they being hoochie mamas?  Holy moly.  Like you wouldn't believe.  All right, punch it up.  Let's take a look.  I'll be the judge.  Oh, you got it?  No, I'm going to have to find it.  I know.  Anyone have it out there?  Instant feedback would be way better at this point.  If someone has the link for that.  I had to read it off my wall.  You did?  My wall.  All right, we'll get to it, I guess, but.  Yo.  So, what are they, what are they, and you guys, and you guys saw the Canadian game show 
[02:07:00]  host Kissing the Little Girls, right?  Oh, God, that guy is so fucking, what a goal.  You haven't seen that either?  No.  What a creep that guy is.  You haven't seen which one?  Which one?  I missed it.  I think if you just put in a Canadian, oh, fuck.  Petto game show host.  Oh, that guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Canadian game show host fucking creep something.  He's trying to do almost like a Richard Dawson, how Richard Dawson would kiss all the women.  Oh, I thought you guys had seen this one.  But he's doing it on a kid game show, so there's kids there, and they don't want to kiss this 
[02:07:30]  fucking guy.  No.  But he's pretty much forcing them.  Oh, this guy.  I was almost going to.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wait, wait.  Pause, please.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  It's the Uncle Paul show.  Gotta give a kiss before you get your question.  Yeah, everyone's been making Uncle Paul references with this video.  But we're doing way too much visual stuff today, so let's paint the picture.  You got this creepy fucking game show host.  Yeah, very 70s looking game show set. 
[02:08:00]  And she's sitting in front of her little fucking microphone and getting ready to answer whatever  dumb question.  And he sort of has his arm around her to the left, probably leaning on the back of her  chair.  And he's leaning way too close, and now he wants to get to know her.  And Leanne can't be more than, help me out, Ant.  10, 9, maybe?  9 or 10, okay.  And her fucking hair is so 70s.  She's like a fucking 70s bassist hairdo.  It really is a 70s do right there.  But that's what gives you comfort.  You know she's now 35 and traumatized by this very moment. 
[02:08:30]  Exactly, in a full-blown dyke.  This man kissed her.  All right, here we go.  Easy, you're both very pretty.  I think you have green eyes.  Are they?  They're not blue.  Now, don't tell me that.  Look at me real closer.  They're green.  Pause that.  All right, all right.  Here's what he did.  He goes, they're not blue.  And he goes, let me look closer.  And he gets closer and closer, looking at her eyes, and then just strikes like a cobra 
[02:09:00]  and kisses her right on the lips.  Was that lips or cheek?  That was lips.  Lips.  This guy, you won't even question it the more you watch this, because it gets even worse.  Okay.  But why, like, how did, how did this guy get away with this?  It was the 70s.  You think he could just get away with this shit?  He could have felt her little nubs up, and no one would do anything.  Yeah, they look like little oranges.  It was, obviously, it was the 70s.  It was her fault.  Hey, no one cared back then.  Let me see that again.  That's great.  No, just keep going. 
[02:09:30]  No, no, no, no.  They'll probably reshow it.  See, I fooled you.  I fooled you.  I fooled you.  They do slow.  You talk about getting married and having a family and things like that?  No.  You don't?  What do you do when you're 11 years old for a date?  Where do you go?  What are some things you do?  You just walk home from school with each other.  Oh, you walk home from school with each other.  She's petrified.  Look, she's leaning away from him.  Do you hand out kisses, Jennifer?  New girl.  New girl, yeah.  Big slow motion. 
[02:10:00]  Like a young lady who likes to give lots of hugs and kisses out, do you?  Hey?  Hey?  Not really.  Not really.  Oh, boy.  Am I hugging a kiss?  She's shaking her head no.  She's petrified.  I can't have one?  Even if I say and whisper in your ear that, Allison, you're going to win the show, I still 
[02:10:30]  can't have a hug and a kiss?  Uh-uh.  Well, I guess you can't win the show, then, if I don't get a hug and a kiss.  Or I'll kill your puppy.  Yeah.  You hear that?  Someone's...  You hear that?  Dirty old man.  Someone just called him a dirty old man.  That's a good answer.  Oh, you missed.  Stephanie, which category?  Oh, my God, he tried to kiss her.  Here's Tracy, who's really...  She's like a seven.  Are you shy?  Can I have a little kiss, please? 
[02:11:00]  Oh, woo-hoo!  What's wrong with this guy?  Now, Stephanie.  You get a whole bunch of right answers.  It's a good show.  You give out kisses.  Uncle Paul.  Don't you, Stephanie?  You don't, too?  How come?  Yeah.  Okay, we've got Stephanie Lorraine here in the big family.  Hey, kiss.  I couldn't get that kiss earlier.  He's...  The mother...  The mother...  It's always so easy to kiss.  It's the kids. 
[02:11:30]  Okay, dear.  The mother...  Woo-hoo!  He goes, the mothers are always so easy to kiss,  but the kids...  And he made a face when the mother kissed.  I'm like, ugh.  Who is that guy?  What a creep, right?  I hope he's dead.  I don't.  I hope he's got another show.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Sometimes they tell you they're going to kiss you,  but they don't.  Wow.  He really is bad.  That's creepy, man. 
[02:12:00]  That one's rough.  Leaning in.  That's rough, man.  Yeah, but sometimes you just got to tell him  that it's going to be okay.  Yeah, it's going to be okay?  Sure.  You just stick your tongue out like an eel.  Wow.  Wow.  Like you said, man, it was the 70s, I guess.  No one thought anything of that, right?  Yes.  That guy got off on kissing kids.  Come on.  He certainly did.  More than that, I'm sure.  He certainly did.  Do you think there might be some problems that maybe they never...  Love to know what happened to him.  Yeah.  Does anyone know about that guy? 
[02:12:30]  What's...  It was from Canada, I think someone told you.  Can we get a little history on this guy?  Somebody's got it.  Him and Bob McAllister were arrested for jerking each other off.  Let's say hi to Uncle Paul on the line here.  Uncle Paul.  How you doing, boy?  Wow.  Wow, Uncle Paul.  Hi.  There's nothing wrong with this guy.  He's just a happy, loving gentleman.  You know what?  You're absolutely right.  I think this guy should be given a new television program. 
[02:13:00]  Punch you now.  He gave a good laugh.  Thank you very much.  You're doing great, Uncle Paul.  Sure does.  Sounds just like me.  Don't do that no more.  Let's go to Bill in Pennsylvania.  Bill.  Hello, Bill.  Hello, boys.  Listen, I was molested as a child, and my memories aren't as creepy as that guy.  Yeah, he is really bad.  I've got the douche chills, though.  It's horrible.  Have you seen the video yet? 
[02:13:30]  You've got to check out the video sometime today.  It's really, really creepy how he looks at him and everything.  And the girls are leaning away from him.  They don't want him near them, and he leans in and just grabs kisses.  It's very inappropriate.  He probably has bad breath, like talking breath.  All right, ready for this?  We're going to get info on this guy.  Thank you.  Brian in Canada.  Brian.  Hey, boys.  Hey, Brian.  Brian. 
[02:14:00]  I'm not by my laptop right now, but this guy, okay, his name is Fergie Oliver.  Not Oliver.  It's like Oliver without the I.  It's Oliver.  Okay.  So he was – actually, that show is from the 80s.  Okay.  Not the 70s.  And he hosted it with his wife, who was a fucking total hot, younger chick.  Like, you could Google immature.  Her name is Catherine Swing.  And, anyways, this guy was a sportscaster.  He was the Toronto Blue Jays guy. 
[02:14:30]  And one time it made the papers up here that he was interviewing Desmond Tutu for some reason.  And he says to him, how about them Blue Jays?  And he kind of slapped him on the back.  He's just totally inappropriate at all times, and everybody fucking hated him.  But he lucked out in this Toronto Blue Jays job, and so, you know, we were stuck with him  because there's two fucking channels up here and whatever.  And is he still kicking?  Yeah, he's still around, but nobody's heard from him, like, for ages.  Fergie Oliver. 
[02:15:00]  How long did he have this kid show for?  Why?  No, no, how long?  Oh, not very long.  Like, it was – it lasted probably about four or five years, but it had a couple of different hosts.  But this guy's a sports guy.  He knew nothing about shit.  He was trying to fucking make out with eight-year-olds.  Yeah, very creepy.  Very creepy.  It's one of the creepier videos I've seen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because, I mean, the little girls are just horrified.  They're just like, oh, my God, where's my mom and dad?  I love what –  Why are they allowing this to happen?  I really love what somebody did with it, though, and they slow it down. 
[02:15:30]  They show him the clip, and then he's like, Russ, you like to kiss?  He's all in their space with his bad man breath.  Oh, what a goal.  Let's go to Kevin in Toronto.  Kevin.  Yo, what's happening?  How are you, buddy?  Yeah, dude just stole my fucking thunder, man.  But, yeah, the guy's name is Fergie Oliver.  Oliver.  Yeah.  Oliver, right.  Yeah.  And, yeah, the show was on for a while, but he was an idiot, this guy. 
[02:16:00]  But he was never arrested for anything, or – I mean –  What's that?  He was never arrested?  There's, like, no –  No, no, no.  Police reports in his past?  Because –  No, no, he's just an idiot, man.  Like, people just love to watch him act like a fool.  He just –  That was more than acting like an idiot.  I bet he's not a pedophile, because a pedophile wouldn't be that way publicly.  Like, a – that's on television.  He's just –  He would do it with guys, too.  He's just an ass. 
[02:16:30]  Like, I think he –  He would do it with little –  Young men would be on that show, too, and he'd be all up in their face just like that.  Right.  With young dudes, too, so who knows, man.  All right.  That's all we got on him.  Thank you, Kevin.  I appreciate it.  No worries, man.  Ghoul.  Yeah, that's –  What a ghoul.  We've got to find the dance video, too.  Yeah.  Yes, we do.  Yeah.  Well, what have we got here?  Oh.  A game show. 
[02:17:00]  Oh.  Hey, someone is saying Google really creepy Dutch TV host video.  It's even more horrific.  Oh, we saw that one already.  We did?  Yeah.  Which one was that?  Oh, man.  I know we saw it.  I kind of recall that.  I forget what he's doing.  Oh, that's like when he's, like, biting the kid's shoulder.  Remember he's, like, singing to him?  And there's, like, a kid sitting down, and he's, like –  Oh, God, yeah.  We didn't see that.  What a creep. 
[02:17:30]  All right.  And someone sent me the link for that –  Oh, you got it?  Oh, you got it.  Good.  I don't think Danny has –  I don't think Anthony has seen this.  Some –  A huge dance competition.  Oh, no.  How do people allow their kids to do this?  Because they're shitty, vapid parents.  They're doing four moves, and they're, like, eight and nine. 
[02:18:00]  Nice ass.  And the audience goes wild.  What fucking despicable parents.  Right?  This wouldn't be bad if they were dressed, like, in cute kid outfits, but they're dressed like little fucking cabaret dancers.  Yeah.  Doing a lot of stripper moves.  And a lot of, like, kind of Britney Spears slash whoever the latest pop star is. 
[02:18:30]  They're wearing, like, little tops.  Their midriffs are out.  Like, little –  They're dressed like whores.  They're sticking their asses out.  Doing splits.  What's shit parents, man?  Bending all the way over.  Shit parents.  They are just shit parents.  Bunch of parents who ammounted to nothing and can't admit that they ammounted to nothing.  I'd be upset if I wasn't jerking off. 
[02:19:00]  The choreography is terrific, though.  I mean, they practice a lot.  If they were dressed appropriately, these are fucking parents – these are sports parents.  That's why they don't keep school.  It's about the kids not being able to handle defeat.  It's about the parents not being able to handle their kids losing.  They're on, like, go-go boots.  Yeah.  And it's red and black, all dressed in red and black.  Oh, with fucking awful parents.  Doing their fuck dances.  Yeah, it's appropriate for an 8-year-old.  They're just moving their hips in a way they shouldn't know how to move them. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, how do they fucking –  You shouldn't know how to move those hips like that for another few years.  And then they walk off with their asses jiggling.  Yep.  Yep.  Why is that okay but half that other shit isn't?  I don't understand this world, man.  I don't know.  Comments have been disabled.  I'm sure they have been.  Of course, because I'm sure there's people really angry and then other people just being fucking despicable.  That's – was that United States of America or is that somewhere else? 
[02:20:00]  I don't know the history of that thing.  I don't know.  It was obviously a big-time dance competition.  It's very flashy and –  There were those websites that were like – they weren't kiddie porn, but they were like girls in really suggestive 10, 8, 9-year-olds, 11-year-olds in really fucking suggestive poses.  But they didn't classify as kiddie porn.  I don't know what the legal classification –  Teen model.  Yeah, that's what they called them.  But they weren't even teens, some of these fucking girls.  Teen model. 
[02:20:30]  And what fucking horrendous parents.  It's like you're basically just showing your kids fucking pussy for money.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Blabbermouth.  Blabbermouth.  They call you a blabbermouth.  You're a blabbermouth.  That really fucking annoys me.  Look, I don't know what we want to do with this instant feedback, but I will read it.  Justin from Westchester, PA.  If you guys want to see creepy, YouTube – E-D-A-R-E-M.  Ederem. 
[02:21:00]  E?  I guess that's the channel name.  I don't know if this is safe.  That's what I'm worried about.  He's a convicted child molester.  It's on YouTube.  It's got to be on YouTube.  Okay.  He's back in jail now because owning video and computer stuff violated his parole.  He is the creepiest man alive, guaranteed.  It's a Radisson, so, you know, it's got to be good.  So many good lines in that film, right?  I know.  Fucking love it.  And then he's like, here's a good one to start with.  This guy's a creepy fuck that has his own YouTube channel. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, God.  He looks like Doc Brown looks now.  And he's back in jail.  He's looking around.  A very old guy.  Oh, my God.  He's doing a little dance.  He's singing Pretty Woman.  He looks like Rip Fries from Rocky Horror.  Yeah, he does.  Does it go anywhere?  Or is he just singing this song?  He's just singing this song. 
[02:22:00]  Or is this some guy just trying to get us?  Why would someone send us this link?  I want to chastise the audience.  He's not good.  Well, you know what?  He does say go a good one to start with.  There's another one where his dog is chewing on his belly and licking his nips and shit.  Yeah, but if it's just him lip syncing some kind of shit.  Well, yeah, of course.  That was a complete fail.  Yeah.  Yeah, fail.  Fail.  Because then we might as well just play Pretty Woman.  Why not?  Like, just put it on and play it. 
[02:22:30]  That's a good song.  All right.  What are you going to do?  Sometimes it's a fucking dead end, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know what it is.  Are parents putting their kids in more inappropriate things these days?  Or does this always go on?  I think it's more socially acceptable for a younger person to be in provocative poses like that.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, Miley Cyrus is a product of the Disney Channel.  You know what I'm saying?  And now there's a controversy about her latest video. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, very racy.  She's 17, though.  Yeah.  And a lot of the stuff on ABC Family, which is Disney also.  I mean, you know, and I could take a lot of things.  And sometimes I'll watch, like, a promo on that.  And I'm like, whoa.  I'm like, this is for kids?  Like, why are they learning about this?  Your cock is out.  Yeah.  I was watching a goddamn biography on fucking Shirley Temple.  And there was some inappropriate shit going on back in the 30s and stuff.  They would, well, have her with a black man.  They said she had sex appeal to people.  People actually thought she was sexy. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, yeah.  She started out doing these movies that were very popular back then.  where they would have little kids acting as adults, like in a movie where they would  play parts of, like, adults with love scenes and shit like that.  Really kind of twisted.  That wackiness of Hal Roach.  Is that real?  She's in front of a swastika?  Or is that some kind of Photoshop?  That's got to be Photoshop.  That's got to be, right?  It's actually something for Crispin Glover.  Oh, God. 
[02:24:00]  I love it.  It's a Crispin Glover thing.  It's got, like, a nude Shirley Temple in front of a swastika.  Wow.  Dressed in, like, some Nazi regalia.  Crispin Glover rules.  A little bit of Nazi hat.  Crispin Glover rules.  He was fun to watch in Hot Tub Time Machine.  Even though the movie, I didn't really dig that much.  We were watching a little Crispin Glover.  Fucking rules.  Clowny clown clown.  Yeah, yeah.  You guys want some clowny clown clown?  Clowny clown clown.  Look up clowny clown clown.  A little insane. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, we got it?  He's crazy.  It's Crispin Glover.  And the video just makes no sense.  He's smoking a cigar.  He's...  I don't know what he's doing.  There's a clown.  I was walking on the ground.  I didn't make a sound, man.  I turned around and I saw a clown.  Had a frown.  Stood on a mound.  Started barking like a hound.  I didn't make a sound, man.  When I came to it, I turned around and I saw something that was brown. 
[02:25:00]  So we became great friends.  And late in life, we got sick.  This makes no sense.  I gave him some soup, but he got worse.  It asked for its purse.  It got it.  People in pig masks.  It was empty, so it cried aplenty.  I wondered what to do. 
[02:25:30]  I don't...  I didn't know what to think.  I'm enjoying this.  Are you?  And then I showed it something that was brown.  Then it died.  A smile fell on the ground.  It's weird.  Yeah.  You think?  Just a little.  I thought those days with the clown.  I get teary-eyed.  And really snide.  Deep down. 
[02:26:00]  McFly.  I hated that clown.  Hello.  So he just wrote a poem and it became a song.  Not as much as Mr. Farr.  I'm going to go smoke a cigar.  No.  What he did was he took certain words and just found words that rhymed with it.  And strung them together.  He's going to smoke a cigar.  I was walking on the ground.  I didn't make a sound.  And then I turned around.  I saw a clown.  Clowny clown clown. 
[02:26:30]  Clowny clown clown.  Ha ha.  I hate you clown.  Your ugly frown.  What's wrong with that?  Smiley lips.  Looks like a drink.  I'm going to clip you across the nose clown.  Yeah.  The cigar will get you real far.  Stories.  Like Mr. Farr.  Get it?  Mr. Farr.  This is his density.  Clown. 
[02:27:00]  Is that new or old?  Clown.  See what a cigar will do?  Clown.  Ugly clown.  There you go.  Little sir, guys.  Clowny clown clown.  And he's just smoking a cigar.  He is fucking weird, man.  That made zero sense.  Yeah, he's a weird cat.  Zero.  Crispin Glover's the man, though.  We all agree.  No, he's weirdo.  He's the man.  He was, like, you thought, watching Back to the Future, that he was just a normal, like, 
[02:27:30]  actor.  Doing that?  And then right after that, he just lost his fucking mind.  I don't know.  How did he handle direction?  Like, how could you direct him to, all right, go ahead, do the wacky little dance at the  Enchantment Under the Sea dance.  And he's there.  Before he looks at the clock and realizes he's got to go outside and prevent a rape.  Would you think I was a jerk if I wrote one called Frowny Clown? 
[02:28:00]  Frown?  Frowny Clown Clowning.  And it was like this, but I pretended it was mine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You'd probably look pretty unoriginal.  Frowning Clown Clowny.  And would you make it all rhyme like that?  Yeah, but different rhymes.  Horrible rhymes.  Yeah.  Really bad rhymes.  Yeah, like, I was checking out a clown.  Whatever the fuck I'm saying to that.  Jesus, Jimmy.  John in North Carolina.  John, help me out here.  B-b-b-b-boy, b-b-b-boy. 
[02:28:30]  Hey, John.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hi, sir.  Oh, yeah.  All right, not...  Listen, guys, I've got a problem coming up this weekend.  My ex wants to allow my daughter to go to the car wash with the middle school and high school cheerleaders.  Yes.  They're doing a car wash?  Yeah.  Where they get in their little bathing suits and you drive the car through and they do a horrid job of washing the car,  but you don't care because there's high school girls washing your car? 
[02:29:00]  When you drive by one of those, do you just, thank God, even though you don't even...  Stop it.  Thank you, God.  What did I do to deserve this today?  And you know they're just wrecking your finish on your car.  They could be using Brillo on the fucking thing and you don't care.  You don't care because they're...  Right out of the showroom.  Because their little nubs are getting a little wet and soapy.  Hey!  They're spraying each other with the hose and giggling.  Right.  Oh, stop it.  Oh, this is so great.  Oh, stop.  Oh, we better run around naked now.  Oh.  Stop it.  What upsets me the most is when the guys stay in the car. 
[02:29:30]  Where are the guys supposed to go?  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  Just don't sit in the car like a creep looking out the window.  Why?  You're supposed to, like, stop your car, get out, and jerk off?  What are you supposed to do?  Yeah.  How else are you going to hide your boner?  You can't be out of your car.  And then everyone's going to know you've got a tent in the front of your fucking sweatpants.  Your white spandex shorts.  That you put on just for the car wash.  So you don't want her doing that?  No, sir.  She's only 12. 
[02:30:00]  Would she wash a Mustang Shelby?  Yeah.  How about a private wash?  Do they have a private wash?  A lap wash?  No, you're such a...  We almost heard Anthony quiver.  Y'all are not helping me.  You're being a real frowny clown clowning clown.  Oh, come on.  Old enough for their first haircut.  Old enough to fuck.  All right.  What the fuck?  That's three. 
[02:30:30]  What the fuck?  Bob the Trugger, Bob.  Hi, Bob.  Hey, boys.  Every day I had to stick with these parents.  I used to be an athletic director for a peewee football league.  And unfortunately, cheerleading is a part of my responsibility, too.  Pass me the ball.  Go.  Okay.  And the bombs and the cheerleading competitions.  They dress these girls up like little whores.  I'm like, I'm out.  The chair of feed.  The chair of feed.  The aunt.  And they would actually fight.  I had a mother break another mother's. 
[02:31:00]  Over whose daughter was prettier.  I would just love if Anthony's brain snapped and you went into a spiral.  You just did that for the rest of your life.  I could happen.  I could happen.  Yep.  Hmm.  Let's go to Todd in Philly. 
[02:31:30]  Hey, Todd.  What's going on with your fucking flyers?  Holy shit.  Don't even.  Don't even start.  Throw-ins kicking their ass.  Three games to zip.  What?  It's over, Johnny.  It's over.  Okay.  Oh, man.  So, my girlfriend, she ran a dance studio and I was with her for five years.  Yeah.  And that video you were watching is not unusual, man.  Every single one of these dance competitions is just like that.  I mean, like six, eight-year-old girls just prancing around when their parents are just eating it up like candy. 
[02:32:00]  I mean, because, you know, like you were saying, every one of these parents didn't have a life of their own, couldn't make it.  So, they're living, you know, vicariously through their little, like, prostatots is what they call it.  Prostatots.  Yeah.  But, yeah, it's frigging gross.  Yeah, that's what they do on that Little Miss Perfect.  There's always these big, fat women that drag their kids in there.  Yeah, everyone in these fat house-trails couldn't make it.  Yeah, it's so much more important to them than it is the kid.  And they see them up with makeup and fucking spray on tans and get their giant hair sprayed and then parade them around like little hewis. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, and if they don't win the little trophy, their mom just treats them like garbage and, like, beats them until they win it the next time.  So, for the wow-wire, we're going to put her in a little bikini and have her just go across the stage doing one of them backwards crab moves.  Now, you watch because you're really bothered and you're taking notes for the authorities. 
[02:33:00]  Why are you watching this?  Because the gay guy and the parents are just fantastic.  It's a train wreck.  It's like any other show you would watch and go, like, like Hoarders.  I watch Hoarders.  I get annoyed as fuck watching Hoarders.  But you've got to watch it.  You're pissed at the people.  You're genuinely mad at the people.  Let me get this.  You watch the child dance show for the gay guy and the parents, huh? 
[02:33:30]  Yes, exactly.  I watch the child fashion show.  The child beauty pageants is what it is.  I watch it for the gay guy and the fat parents.  Thank you.  And this is just filler.  That's my story and I'm sticking to it.  And the girls prancing around with little whores.  That's just filler.  Filler in between the gay guy.  Occasionally it is like watching the farm team.  But, you know, what are you going to do? 
[02:34:00]  What channel is this on?  A&E?  What time?  What day?  I really, I think it's Wednesday.  I haven't watched it in months.  You know, we really do go against nature, though.  Because if you think about, like, a real old dog that fucking itches all day long.  And then you see a nice, young, little puppy.  A puppy.  What are you grabbing first?  Oh, you love the puppy, don't you?  As long as that puppy isn't ODing on coke in the bedroom. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  I didn't know.  What's wrong with her?  The colonel.  Yeah.  And Phyllis Eymour Hoffman.  Is she okay?  Yeah.  She's so obviously not okay.  She's bleeding from the face.  Is she all right?  All right.  Why don't we do her?  Wow, where?  We got Ian Smith.  Hello.  Dr. Ian Halpern.  No, not doctor.  No, not doctor.  Wow, I'm all fucked up.  Ian Halpern.  Holy shit.  Just call him.  His highness.  His highness.  You want to talk to his highness today?  We haven't talked to him in a couple weeks.  Yeah, I'd like to hear what his highness is working on. 
[02:35:00]  Did we rest him enough?  Yeah, I'd like to know why he didn't know about Corey Haim dying of pneumonia and not drugs.  Did he say drugs?  No, he really didn't have.  I think he insinuated it was drugs.  What does he say, really?  Nothing.  Half the time.  Nothing.  What does he say, really?  But the good thing is, if we talk to him, that way we're guaranteed we'll hear something from him in the news tomorrow and not on our show. 
[02:35:30]  And he said a big-time politician was cheating.  Was he hinting at Obama on his last phone call?  That's a big-time politician.  This is a story that's kind of making arounds that he might have cheated in 2004 or something.  Here's what he does.  He throws out things that could happen.  Like, I understand there's someone cheating in Hollywood.  Yeah.  It's going to happen.  And then it happens and he goes, Google it.  I said, Google it.  I told you.  I told you it was going to happen.  All right.  We'll talk to him next.  What the hell?  Yeah!  We got an... 
[02:36:00]  All right.  Whatever.  Can we get to the Elizabeth Hasselbeck?  Yes!  Stuff.  We're back.  I want to hear it.  Yeah.  She was crying like a...  Oh, whatever.  It's good audio.  It's terrific.  Like a clowning, frowning clown.  It's a clown.  Oh, there you go.  Clowns that frown are clowny.  Clown.  They get me down.  And downy.  Syndrome-y.  Downy Syndrome.  That's what I fluff my clothes with.  Downy Syndrome little... 
[02:36:30]  You fluffed tongues with it.  Downy Syndrome.  What does fermé la bouche mean?  Close your mouth, but in a nice way.  Oh, it's a nice way.  Yeah.  It's not like shut up.  It's like...  Please stop talking.  Could be if someone's like just perpetually stupid and their mouth is hanging.  How do you say rudely shut up?  Tayeul.  Tayeul.  Tayeul?  Yeah, but that's in French-Canadian, not in French for France.  Oh, it's different. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  Tayeul.  Yeah.  All right.  It doesn't sound really good.  So how long are you here for Beezit?  We're leaving today.  Ah, shit.  Going back to France.  You want citizenship?  Yeah.  Yeah?  I can hook you up with some citizenship, yo.  My God.  They're lovely girls.  I know, really.  Sorry we came to crash your party.  No, you didn't crash anything.  All right.  Point to which one is exactly Anthony's type.  Go ahead. 
[02:37:30]  Both are very lovely, but I would say...  The brunette.  Yeah.  Anthony tends to...  Yeah.  Anthony tends to like...  You look like you're more damaged.  She likes the damaged ones.  More damaged ones?  Did you have good upbringing or do you have, like, daddy issues or baggage?  Do you have a lot of baggage?  No.  No?  No.  You have a stable life and everything?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No traumas early on or anything like that?  Baggage that you carry around?  Do you cry on certain holidays?  Because I like girls that cry on, like, Father's Day and Christmas. 
[02:38:00]  I cry a lot, yeah.  Yeah?  That's good.  Where can people...  I'm sorry, good.  No, no.  I was just saying, that's good that she cries on certain holidays.  Where can people see you if they want to see what you look...  Because we're talking about you and they can't see you.  So where can they see you?  Well, they could see them on my Twitter, Opie Radio.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah.  I'm fucking putting this picture up.  Are you on Beezit or on the website?  We're not on the website.  Why aren't you girls on the website?  That's insane.  We will be.  What are they, queers?  We'll get back.  We'll get something out. 
[02:38:30]  Really?  God damn.  What did you do on Howard?  Did you take all your clothes off?  No, we judged the hottest tranny contest.  Wow.  We gave them $5,000.  Who won?  Howard won.  Really?  Oh, I'm kidding, Howard.  Stop.  Who won?  I won first prize, Rob.  I was an Asian girl.  Guy.  No, no. 
[02:39:00]  She looked really good.  Really?  Any bulge or a good tuck?  Well, she had her clothes on.  She had the biggest cock, I think.  She might have been the one with the biggest cock.  Biggest cock, too?  Wow.  Yeah, they were talking about it.  Really?  Yeah.  What was her name?  Celeste.  Boo.  The Asian with the biggest cock.  What alternative reality are we in?  Jesus.  Who hasn't sent them back?  You lied.  That's not eight fully functional.  So what, how many young ladies were in this fantastic contest?  Six.  Okay.  Five or six. 
[02:39:30]  You've got six trannies in one room.  Five or six.  How much that cost you, Jim?  Oh, boy, a lot.  That's a lot of testosterone.  That's a lot of razors dipped in garlic.  They're fucking psychos.  They carry razors soaked in garlic, so if they cut you, it goes, they're not fucking emotionally  healthy.  Oh, Jesus.  No one knew that.  So what were some of their names?  What were some of the transgender names?  I want to see if I recognize any of them.  Azel?  No.  Jesse?  Maybe.  Jessica?  Celeste?  And then there was one that was really bad.  The guy that has no imagination. 
[02:40:00]  I'm Bob.  I'm Marcus.  It's just a guy with a fucking, like, a ladies' whack hat.  All right.  Do you have other places to go today before you leave?  Do you have any suggestions for us?  Ah, there's a nice place out on Long Island.  Mm.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Yeah, any time afternoon would be fine.  Oh, I'm teasing, of course.  You girls obviously have places to go.  He basically owns a whole block.  You might want to go out there.  Yeah, she's got everything you need, too. 
[02:40:30]  All right.  I'm going to Google the Tranny Celeste.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  See what she looks like.  Jimmy's been known to mistakenly rub a few broad backs.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, I mean, that's a good thing to tell the hot chicks.  Thinking that perhaps, yeah, something was going on.  Wow.  Very long legs.  Yes, and a large lady.  I don't need to point that out.  I mean, obviously, you know.  But where's Opie going?  Jesus Christ, Opie, where are you going with that camera?  I know.  Oh, he's panning up.  Yeah, he's doing, like, creepy filming. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  I'm not creepy filming.  I'm saying hi to the girls.  I'm not a creep.  Wow, those Canadians put out some good shit.  Really do.  All right.  Are the Canadians strip clubs as good as they say, or are they overrated?  There's a lot of Asians in there, though.  I like, like, why aren't girls like you?  No, there's girls like us.  Yeah?  Where do I got to go for that?  A lot of native girls.  Yeah?  Because I don't like the false advertising.  You see the pictures on the outside.  The girls look like you girls.  And you walk in, and I'm in Saigon. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, I just don't want to say afternoon.  Dude, they smell really good.  I'm asking.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah, that is her, actually.  Oh, wow.  Look at you, Jimmy.  Just Google it.  Jimmy, well, you could pick out a tranny.  Well, I just Googled, you know.  Whatever.  Googled Jimmy's last night.  Oh, what a nice, look at that.  She looks like a girl.  She got the nurse hat out.  Look how helpful she is.  She's sucking the man's penis.  What a helpful nurse.  Is that the one there?  Oh, wow.  Look at that man.  He's on his back, and she's straddled his face waiting for the police to come. 
[02:42:00]  Right.  She's a helpful nurse.  Jesus.  A helpful nurse.  I love the fact that she's just licking the guy's penis and just, like, looking at the  camera.  Yeah.  How could that help anybody?  Everything's dandy.  And you should go over there, because they smell really good.  No, I can smell them from here.  It's wonderful.  Really good.  If I go over there, I might get arrested for something.  What cologne do you guys got on?  I don't know.  Cologne.  Perfume.  Oh, perfume.  Sorry.  High karate.  I'm wearing fucking...  Would you care for a bite of my turkey sandwich? 
[02:42:30]  No, thanks.  I never know what to say to pretty girls, so I'm going to bite of my turkey sandwich.  Would you like my camera?  What else do you guys...  He's giving away electronics to the girls.  Let's take...  I want to take a photo of the girls.  Yes, take a good picture.  What do you guys do when you're not working for Beezid?  You do other modeling?  I'm saying they've got to do something else.  Yeah, what else do you do when you're not doing Beezid?  We understand you're plugging the Beezid today, and we love Beezid.  And we love Beezid.  They advertise on our show.  We're doing a great job for them.  Jimmy's getting a nice photograph. 
[02:43:00]  Okay.  A photograph.  Ooh, take a picture.  Take a picture.  It lasts longer.  Here's my iPhone.  And I'll get in here.  Yay.  Yes.  Hello, ladies.  Ooh.  This is a nice place to be.  I love this job.  Fucking Anthony.  Thank you.  What did you do?  You better be good, Daniel.  It is good.  Oh, we're taking pictures with the Beezid girls.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Oh, that's a good one. 
[02:43:30]  You like that picture?  You are fucking Jesus Christ.  Is that good?  Oh, that's a nice one, Jimmy.  Safe to say she could be the hottest girl that's ever been in the studio.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, they're very, very beautiful girls.  Remember when I said I would never get married again?  Right.  French-Canadian.  My God.  And they smell very good.  I swear.  She would destroy you.  So you're kind of like the spokesmodels for Beezid.com.  Green card?  I work.  You want green card?  You do actually work there?  Yeah, we have any products.  Any products you want to see? 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, there's some products I'd love to see.  Used white thongs.  So you actually work for them?  Are they based out of Canada?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  That's why they bring the girls in from Montreal.  Well, I'll be at the Just for Laughs festival this year on the Nasty Show.  So you should have Beezid.com send you there.  She's politely nodding at you, Jimmy.  Yes, I know.  What's that?  Politely nodding.  Ladies.  No, but they might come.  Yeah, they have to go.  All right.  Well, it was nice to meet you both.  Absolutely.  Thanks for having us. 
[02:44:30]  Thank you, Beezid girls.  We actually like your website, too.  All right, Beezid.  Look at Beezid.  You know something?  If more sponsors were like this.  Yeah.  God damn.  All right, don't get in the way, Jimmy.  Dude, she is so.  Oh, my God.  That could be.  Holy shit.  That could be the hottest girl that's ever been in our studio.  The blonde.  They're both beautiful.  Not the blonde.  I prefer the blonde.  Nothing against the blonde, but that French-Canadian brunette was ridiculous.  Oh, my God.  I preferred the blonde girl, though.  You're a couple of very beautiful girls, you know what?  I like them.  Who were you tonight? 
[02:45:00]  The Kit Kat Club?  I love the tall Nordic.  Ridiculous.  And I'm wearing a black Sabbath shirt.  You like the blonde over the brunette?  Oh, by far.  But the brunette was beautiful.  By far.  Yeah, the brunette was like ridiculous.  Brunette by far for me.  The blonde turned me on so much.  Fucking Danny.  Hey.  Danny's trying to move the mics, and they're hitting him in the head.  Danny, see if they'll squeeze their boobs up against our glass.  We haven't had a-  I want to see the ass.  A prison visit.  Yeah, yeah.  Yes.  We might have to do it.  We could probably do it.  Nah, just do it.  Fuck the curtains.  Just do it spontaneously.  This is a big sponsor for fucking SiriusXM. 
[02:45:30]  They can handle a little-  They love Beezer.  A breast smear on our-  Her ass was so-  That-  The blonde?  The blonde.  Was it tall?  She was like six foot.  Yeah, she was very tall.  Big Nordic.  She would kick me around a hotel and make me smell her feet.  She really would.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just beat the shit out of you.  I love how someone just wrote, this is a disaster.  Oh, well.  Are you kidding me?  Oh, well.  Fuck off.  You know, sometimes this show is just for us.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Sometimes we take a little time for ourselves.  Right.  Idiots.  God forbid.  No one cares. 
[02:46:00]  I'll send out-  Danny's negotiating right now.  Yes.  I'll send out the photo.  I'm just an ugly guy.  Oh, Jimmy.  No, no.  I am.  Don't sell yourself short.  Look at the photo.  Oh.  Yeah.  We're going to get shirts on boobies.  Shirts on boobies?  Yeah, I got to get shirts on boobies.  They won't do this topless.  Yeah, they're not, as far as I know, strippers or anything.  Oh, wow.  They won't do it with a topless?  No.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Why?  I don't know.  You know, the girl's so weird sometimes.  Her ass-  They're horrors.  They're just not real. 
[02:46:30]  What are you doing?  Her ass wrapped-  I'm fucking taking a picture of you.  Her ass wrapped around the thong.  Yeah.  And just-  I wanted to pull the thong out.  It sounded like a deep ass crack.  Yeah?  You wanted to see how deep it went?  I love a deep ass crack.  You want it as deep as that oil rig line that has to be plugged?  Dude, I love a deep ass-  Like, if you roll an orange, I want it to roll into the ass crack.  Oh, it's beautiful.  James.  There they go.  Oh, wowie.  Oh, my God.  Bye.  I like that blonde.  Yeah.  Wow.  Uh, who's that little fellow with them? 
[02:47:00]  Probably Ted Beezit.  Yeah, I know.  Bye.  Bye.  Je t'aime.  I forgot I was having a kid for a moment.  Did you?  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Ian, you still there?  What a creep.  Bonjour.  Wait a minute.  What?  Am I being called a creep?  Bonjour.  To the whole server.  Ian.  Now, Ian.  Anthony got his cute Anthony voice on.  Yes.  Hi.  Hi. 
[02:47:30]  Bonjour.  I'm sorry.  This is good.  Yeah.  I have a big house.  No, I didn't go into the big house thing.  You did the voice, though.  No.  Hi.  Hi.  Yeah.  You don't hear a lot about Obama and the Republicans.  It's all sweet Anthony.  Hi.  Let's ask Ian if we did well, man.  Ian knows how to fucking talk to a broad.  Oh, did I bomb with those girls?  Ian, did we do well or what?  Très bien.  Très bien. 
[02:48:00]  C'était merveilleux, superbe, excellent.  Did very good.  Les femmes de Montréal, est-ce que tu penses qu'elles sont très belles?  Uh, oui.  Oui.  Oui.  You see, Norton, when you do your show this summer, you've got to bring Anthony up with  you, and he'll have the time of his life.  Those people are from my hometown, you know.  In Montreal, they're probably making five bucks an hour doing what they're doing, but  they come to the Big Apple, everyone gives them 15 minutes. 
[02:48:30]  Ian.  Yes.  I love those girls.  You like them?  Yeah.  I want to put my face in that big blonde hiney while she cuts gassers.  It insults me in French.  I'm really surprised you went blonde over brunette.  I would think that brunette would get way more votes than blonde.  And I'm not saying the blonde was ugly.  She wasn't at all.  That brunette, though.  French-Canadian.  Dude, there was something about her height in the short skirt on a tall girl.  I mean, everyone loves that, but I mean, that just ruins me. 
[02:49:00]  Juicy fat ass.  Do you think Howard got a rise with them in their studio this morning?  Yeah, probably.  Probably thought they were attractive.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah?  He's just a man.  I know you guys are all on the same floor, and I love Howard, but, you know, we got to  wonder, with all that testosterone going on on that floor, who's really getting the most  action?  And I happen to think it's Norton.  Norton?  Norton?  You think Norton is getting the most action? 
[02:49:30]  Fuck.  Goddamn.  Norton.  Norton.  I have a girlfriend, dude.  Honestly?  Yeah, man.  Chill out.  No, I don't mind.  I'm saying he probably would be right, because I would be spending a lot of money.  Well, let's say that French-Canadian said, Jim, I want to go to your place right now.  I got a couple hours to kill before my next...  She'd be strangled right now in a bed somewhere.  I would call in a bomb threat to my own apartment.  I love that, dude. 
[02:50:00]  A bomb threat.  My favorite one ever, and this goes back a long time, was like, you want to put your  girlfriend out with the garbage because you want to bring someone home.  I forgot the exact line.  Do you know how mad my girlfriend at the time got at me when I told Heather Graham that  I would have sex with her on top of my girlfriend's coffin?  Okay, that one too, right?  I remember that.  My girlfriend's like, and I played that for my friend, and he couldn't believe you said  that.  I'm like, because he's trying to fuck you.  That's why, stupid.  You know what?  I'll tell you right now. 
[02:50:30]  That French is hotter than Heather Graham, and we've had Heather Graham in studio.  We've had the Heather Graham.  Yeah, they're very hot.  You know, French-Canadian women, and believe me, I've had my share.  I live up there.  Oh, well.  Well, I'm sorry.  Where's the girl today?  Usually, every time you call, there's a girl in the background.  Sleeping.  She's sleeping right now.  Oh, she's sleeping.  What's the matter?  Let me tell you something.  Did your highness, did you wear her out?  Yes.  Ah, see?  Not even a maybe or anything.  He just goes, yes. 
[02:51:00]  I'm just an ugly guy.  I took the picture, and my fucking neck is fat.  Oh.  Oh, Jimmy.  It's all right.  It's not about me.  I've looked at your picture five times.  I haven't even, I don't even see you in that picture.  I'm soon coming to New York, bud.  Oh, yeah?  What?  I'm going to be in your studio in a few weeks.  That'll be up to us.  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There you go.  Now that the distractions are gone. 
[02:51:30]  Sure.  We ought to get into a little something here with Ian.  Anything new happening in Hollywood or the sporting world, whatever?  Whatever it is you do?  Well, yeah.  Well, right now I'm in the hotbed of entertainment, and a lot's going on.  First of all, CNN yesterday did a profile of the three big non-fiction celebrity tell-all authors.  Kitty Kelly, Chris Anderson, and yours truly. 
[02:52:00]  We were all featured on CNN.com yesterday.  It was a brilliant piece by a writer named Brianna.  And it really gives insight into what goes on behind the writing celebrity bios, you know,  because we have a lot of detractors like anyone, but we keep, you know, we keep having these long careers.  And they wonder why we want to cover celebrities.  And, you know, you go to a newsstand, every magazine has a celebrity on the cover. 
[02:52:30]  But when you write unauthorized bios, everyone, you know, they go after the biographer as much as they do the subject.  And Kitty Kelly, I've gone on record to say, lover, hater, she deserves her day in the sun.  I mean, if Oprah Winfrey wants to boycott, you know, and rally media against her, come on, this is 2010 freedom of speech, freedom of information. 
[02:53:00]  And Larry King, Joy Behar, all these people are wimps for not having her on the show.  Well, he's Canadian, eh?  Behar-de-har-har.  So, you know, bring them both on.  Let them debate.  Give them, you know, Oprah Winfrey, if she'd have any chutzpah here, she'd go on Larry King right next to Kitty Kelly if she wasn't hiding anything.  Boo.  Sorry, Ian.  I had to boo Anthony.  He gave me the delayed, I had to swallow my drink, boo. 
[02:53:30]  Ian, let me ask you, Kitty Kelly is usually right, isn't she?  Like, she doesn't get successfully sued?  Kitty Kelly used to be, I believe, a showgirl in Vegas.  And then she...  No.  Yes, absolutely.  Wow.  I didn't know that.  Yes, and that's how she, you know, she switched careers, switched gears.  I admire her.  Look, again, my barometer for success in this business, anyone 10 years and over, I don't care if they're farting on a CD and releasing it, but anyone in show business 10 years and more, I take off my hat to them. 
[02:54:00]  The one-hit wonders I have zero time for.  Okay.  And Kitty Kelly's endured her product, you know, no one's ever sued her successfully, just like His Highness.  I have, you know, I have so many detractors, believe me, I sleep very well at night.  You know, all these people, I was up in Runyon Canyon the other day, some guy, you know, I've been on every show in the world, some guy comes up to me, recognizes me from what show? 
[02:54:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Yes.  He's following Sue.  Yes.  I got the other phone call.  Hiking.  I was hiking.  Hot girls.  Yeah.  With my girlfriend.  And the Opie and Anthony mention.  Ian.  Yes.  Last time you were on our show, you had a blind item about a politician in Washington having an affair or something, or had an affair.  Was that the Obama story that finally came out?  Well, I don't reveal blind items, but just figure it out.  Okay.  What do you think about that, Harry?  Well, let me ask you about Obama, because they're saying back in 2004 he might have been doing a little of that cheating. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, really?  Well, yeah, it was in rag magazines.  I'm not saying anything out of turn here.  He was doing a little tapioca back then.  And, look, you know, Barry Obama, he's had his share.  He was a stud in university.  You know, he's not Mother Teresa.  And Michelle, you know, she's just got to live with it.  Look.  Michelle.  You know.  My bad.  Does this guy really have a passport or what?  I mean, maybe he should be the president of Nigeria. 
[02:55:30]  I have no idea.  Is this a legal president?  Well, I don't know.  Where's his birth certificate?  They're going to spend four years trying to figure that out.  Some speculation.  A lot of speculation.  It is a fair question.  Where's his birth certificate?  I don't even care at this point.  Hawaii says they've come up with it.  Is he circumcised?  I don't know.  I don't really look at guys coming.  That's a question for you, Ian.  Let me ask you a question.  Yeah.  Barry Obama and his highness playing one-on-one, half court.  Who wins?  Barry Obama and his highness. 
[02:56:00]  So obnoxious.  I love it.  I think you would win, to tell you the truth, because Obama's proven, Barry Obama has proven  that he is not a good basketball player.  I'm not impressed with his jump shot.  I'd clean his clock, man.  All right, man.  His highness can dunk.  I'm not kidding you.  I hear you.  Now, your highness.  Yeah.  Princess Di did a little Lesbo stuff, or what?  Wow.  Yeah.  First of all, a few weeks ago, I revealed that she had an affair with a rock singer named 
[02:56:30]  Robert.  It was incorrectly reported in a lot of media.  A lot of people thought it was Robert Palmer, and all I know, it was a rock singer named  Robert.  Now, the same sort of...  Robert Kelley.  Robert Kelley.  I don't know who it was, but she was...  And she had an abortion with this guy.  She checked into a clinic in Switzerland in 1994, two years before she divorced Prince  Charles, and it was all, you know, swept under the rug, so there wasn't a big royal family. 
[02:57:00]  The abortion was swept under the rug?  Vacuumed under the rug.  A little bump in the carpet.  I need to take a mallet to it.  Yeah.  Someone left a tomato under here.  Oh, God.  So she got an abortion down at the free clinic?  Yeah.  She, they, they, they, you know, they, they shuttled her to Switzerland, and, uh, and that  was it.  She, you know...  Well, um...  But now, now the source alleges that she had something like a nine-year affair with, uh, 
[02:57:30]  a woman, and she was into women.  Did you, do you think she was a good box, uh, licker?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  There's no way Prince Charles fucked her right.  Oh, Paul.  No.  Yeah, she, she...  I got...  I like to lick pussy, there's no doubt about it.  I got a, I got a question as far as Princess Di goes.  Now, her, uh, second son there, what do you got?  You got, uh, Harry and you got, uh...  Harry's the young one.  Harry's the young one.  Chip.  Harry and Chip.  Okay.  No, it's William, not Chip. 
[02:58:00]  William and Harry, right.  And Harry thought she bought a logical shot of Prince Charles.  Well, that's what I want to ask you.  Yeah.  It's...  It's...  These guys are doing their own show now, which is fine.  I'm laughing at Prince Chip.  Prince Chip.  Oh, Prince Chip.  He comes up with Prince Chip.  I didn't hear you.  I'm sorry.  Uh, now, it's pretty obvious that the younger one there, that Prince Harry, doesn't look like  fucking the father.  Yeah, he looks like James Hewitt, another person.  Wow.  But it's never been proven, right?  Oh, this has been going around for years.  But you would think in the royal family, they would want to know and have that bloodline, 
[02:58:30]  uh, be, uh, you know, pure and true.  Yes.  You would think.  Prince likes to, you know, sweep everything again under the carpet, keep it...  Because, look, this royal family...  Lumpy carpet.  Yeah, really.  ...family on the planet.  They've been living off tax payers, hard-earned, though, for eons.  And, uh, you know, they don't want to lose their jobs.  They have the best kids.  These people have never worked a day.  Look at the Queen.  Remember back, I think it was 19...  Yes! 
[02:59:00]  Some guy would climb into her bedroom.  Uh-huh.  Do you remember that, when some guy climbed into her bedroom and didn't get caught until  the end?  Yeah.  Yeah, that was her lover.  Oh, damn.  You just don't sneak up the Buckingham Palace.  Like, Anthony just can't sneak up there, put a ladder up, and get access to the Queen's  window.  This is true.  You know, he'd be shot like a pancake.  People shoot pancakes?  They certainly do.  In England, they must shoot pancakes.  Absolutely, because they think that they're soft wheels. 
[02:59:30]  They don't know what they are.  Dumb Brits.  You thought things.  Yes.  Soft wheel, apparently.  It looks like I think it's a flying saucer.  Yes, my word.  Let's murder it.  Pancake hunting today, man.  Get the hands.  Oh, a giant jewel has dropped his yarmulke.  Pancakes.  If the Queen was in your studio now with your banger, she spread her legs.  No.  No.  I let her suck my cock.  Cockled Philip watched.  Cockled.  Cockled Philip.  As she did that stupid wave under your balls. 
[03:00:00]  That's what that's for.  That's how she, yeah, massages your balls.  Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right.  Dumb wave right under your sack.  Yeah, she takes her glove and she'll just, she has like one finger, but it's on your taint.  And it mushes your taint skin.  Like her finger dings into your taint and it wraps around it and fucking, your taint, it's like your taint's been put in a washing machine.  Yes.  It gets agitated.  Just like, just like that, huh?  Yes.  It's wonderful.  That's why, that's why she's known as, as Stinky Fingers Liz. 
[03:00:30]  That's her nickname around, around old Buckingham pal.  See, I didn't know that, Jimmy.  I'm glad you gave me a little knowledge to her.  Oh, Stinky Fingers has got flowers.  Here she comes, yes, old onion fingers.  Yeah.  Ian, I would, I would, I would bang her.  I would.  I think that's a good move.  Yeah, I would bang her.  For the story, you got it.  Come on.  It would be the all-time YouTube hit.  Maybe back in the 40s, 30s.  Exactly, she was changing, like, fucking tires during the war.  Yeah, exactly. 
[03:01:00]  She was.  She was a real go-getter, that, that one.  If you, if you had a blindfold on, would, could you tell that it's, uh, old pussy?  Of course you could.  Of course you could.  Well, apparently she shaves.  She does shave.  It might be hard.  How do you know that she shaves?  How would Ian, even, you highness?  I have very good sources.  Let me tell you.  Anthony giving it to the Queen Missionary style.  Yeah.  That would be the all-time YouTube hit.  That would be a biggie.  You know how you know she shaves?  They found a mound of pubic hair with a little crown on it, on the bathroom floor. 
[03:01:30]  Titus in the background belting out, God save the Queen.  Would that be great?  The Queen's a horny bitch.  The Queen's a gang.  She's a horny bitch, yeah.  This isn't quite a blind item, is it?  Exactly.  I didn't say the Queen of what country?  Google it.  We don't have time for all your other nonsense.  Is there any...  Nonsense?  Is there any other stories that we should be talking about, though?  Yeah.  My Michael Jackson movie's coming out in a few weeks. 
[03:02:00]  Hoo-hoo!  Hee!  Hee!  Oh, my gosh.  Yeah.  And it's been, you know, brought all over the world.  It's going to...  But I thought we were going to be invited to the premiere.  Absolutely.  When are we getting our invites?  We're giving everyone, because of security reasons, see, people are threatening to shoot  me, so they're doing a tight security 24-hour notice.  Who?  Besides our listeners.  Sorry, Ian.  You're a big star.  We apologize. 
[03:02:30]  That wasn't right.  That wasn't right.  A world premiere, and he means world premiere.  This movie's going to be all over the world.  Yes.  Eighty countries it's been bought in.  Really?  You know.  You know.  He goes, you know.  No, we don't.  We don't.  But if you say so.  When is it?  It was the cover of Variety about a month ago.  Yeah, we remember talking about that.  June 25th, the release of my film, meaning his, MJ, gone too soon.  That's right.  And is he gay or not?  Now they're saying he is, then they say he's not. 
[03:03:00]  Came on your show a year ago, whenever it was, and I said he's gay.  You know, I had death threats.  People wanted to boycott the book worldwide.  And, you know, 10 months later.  They did, apparently.  Oh.  Mike comes out on the record.  That's a joke.  One of his doctors confirms it.  And once again, you know, look, I'm not bloating.  I'm not putting myself on a pedestal.  I'm not telling everyone that, you know, I'm the number one guy in the world when it comes to gossip. 
[03:03:30]  But I was right.  When I took all that heat, no one defended me.  Not even Anthony, man.  No, I know.  I apologize for that.  Yeah.  Yeah, Anthony, you should have fucking defended him.  You know I am one of his staunch supporters.  Yes.  Yes.  His Highness, His Majesty, His Highnesses.  After my Jackson film comes out, I'm taking you on the house to Scandinavia for a summer holiday.  That'd be cool.  Yes.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Scandinavia.  But it's going to be called, Oh, Anthony and His Highnesses for vacation. 
[03:04:00]  It sounds thrilling.  Yeah, you're going to have a good time.  But getting back to Jackson, people are coming out now, lovers, saying, you know, look, I don't care if Jackson was gay.  I just mentioned it in a page of my book, and people called for my hat.  Yeah.  They sure did.  Apparently they were calling for his, too.  Get it? 
[03:04:30]  You know.  Hello.  I quoted one guy saying, quoting Jackson, saying, the King of Pop wants to lick your lollipop.  Oh.  His fans freaked out.  Yeah, they sure did.  They couldn't take it.  What a terrible dirty talker.  Yeah, they couldn't take that, right?  The King of Pop wants to lick your lollipop.  Lick your lollipop.  Pop is in there twice.  Yeah, I know.  Sounds stupid.  How about the King of Pop wants your jizz all over his face and burned off hairdo?  A bit of LIGO skin.  Yeah, the King of Pop wants the rest of his skin evened out. 
[03:05:00]  How about some cummy?  Apparently little boy cum has a lot of acid in it.  Everyone's been after me for the content.  You know, this film is under lock and key.  It's in the...  Lock and key, yeah.  Because everyone's been trying to get it, to pirate it.  You know, it's very tight security.  But I'll give you guys the first scoop, because I haven't...  I've had tons of interview requests.  I haven't even nuggeted out what this film's about.  So, let me give you a tease. 
[03:05:30]  All right, all right.  First of all, it's a tribute to MJ.  And at one point, I do a lot of undercover stuff in the film.  You know, I was the only guy really covering MJ the last two years of his life,  until the final six months.  After I announced he had six months to live,  all of a sudden there was, you know, a media blitz on him.  But at one point in the film, I go undercover with MJ's longtime personal trainer.  I told him I was a gay canoe instructor from Canada, wanting to get in shape. 
[03:06:00]  A canoe instructor.  Could you have picked a better fucking cover?  Exactly.  Would you have picked that one out of?  It sounds like an improv fucking...  A hack improv act.  Give me an occupation.  Sounds like we're...  Give me a sexual preference.  Yes.  Give me a location.  Give me something Indians built.  What was that show?  The improv show?  What's your line?  Oh, yeah.  Whose line is it anyway?  Yeah, okay.  All right, yeah, yeah.  That's exactly what he was doing.  Practicing for that show.  A gay Canadian canoe instructor. 
[03:06:30]  Instructor.  Right.  And the only person to buy into that was the incredible Hulk, Lou Ferrigno.  Yeah.  So he put me through the...  I thought you said something else is what it was.  See, because he's deaf.  You know, who reads this?  I didn't even get that.  He could not hear well.  He thought you said you were a gay Jew instructor.  He didn't catch it.  You know, Lou's ears aren't what they should have been.  They were never any good.  They were never anything. 
[03:07:00]  Lou is legally deaf, but he reads lips.  Oh, does he?  Yeah.  Yeah, perfectly.  Perfectly.  Oh.  Well, that's impressive.  Is that a blind item?  You blew it.  It's a deaf item.  A deaf item.  That's the joke.  God damn it.  Is that a deaf item?  God, Jimmy.  All right.  Go ahead, Ian.  Sorry.  Yeah.  So Lou...  Sorry we took this call.  ...workout he did for Jackson for This Is It. 
[03:07:30]  Okay.  And along the way, this is, to me, a lot of info about MJ, but in the movie, you'll see...  Wait, hold on.  He was doing Lou Ferrigno's workout?  Yeah.  So what would he do, just tape two iPod buds to his head and not turn anything on?  Something like that.  Fill his ear canals with hot wax.  Exactly.  And then just talk like a retard.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Get laughed at behind his back, never to his face, because he's muscular. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, we get it.  He can beat you up.  Yeah.  We got that, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  So, Michael Jackson was doing a Lou Ferrigno's workout.  Yeah, Lou trained him for the This Is It tour, and he also trained his highness, undercovers  a gay canoe instructor.  Right.  And, you know, in the film, I asked Lou, who's in better shape?  At the time, Michael was doing the same workout as his highness, and who do you think Lou said  is in better shape? 
[03:08:30]  Hopefully you.  Yeah, he said no contest, his highness.  Oh, yeah.  But, you know...  We learned a lot about his highness.  I want a whole list of things.  I know.  He could be the sniper for the Canadians.  Yeah, yeah.  He could beat Obama in one-on-one.  He could dunk.  What else?  Barry Obama.  No, he called him Barry Oblama.  Barry Oblama.  You know, I have my flaws, too, but I think it's safe to say the richest guy on air right  now is his highness.  So that's not one of my flaws.  So wait, now what's one of the nuggets? 
[03:09:00]  That Michael Jackson wasn't in as good a shape as his highness?  I mean, that's probably a big item, but...  The whole thing is, I actually was able to infiltrate Michael MJ's personal trainer and  get a lot of insight.  You know, Lou's actually a really nice guy.  And he is an amazing trainer.  I mean, that workout that he put me through was grueling.  I have no idea.  You know, he said Michael couldn't even get through like 20 minutes of it.  His highness did the full two hours.  Really? 
[03:09:30]  Yes.  Now, how is that?  Because it looks to me like Michael Jackson, with his dancing and whatnot, would probably  be in pretty good shape.  Yeah.  If he wasn't dead, I mean.  Yeah, well, he wasn't.  You know, Michael...  Oh, really?  Lou said he was a bit lazy, out of shape.  You know, ate a lot of junk food.  E-Rock?  It's not MJ, that's LB.  But it is a tribute to MJ, and there's a lot of good stuff in the film. 
[03:10:00]  I'm going to release the secret MJ tapes that I have in the film.  Oh, damn.  I want to hear those.  What do they consist of?  What does it consist of?  Just a lot of personal thoughts of the King of Pop.  Did they have him working out, saying, Lou, Lou, and then tap-tap, and then Lou goes,  Warrant.  Lou has no idea.  I am MJ's number one fan.  I always loved the guy, and I've met him.  He's one of the nicest people I've ever met. 
[03:10:30]  But there were just so many undesirables around them.  No matter what the autopsy revealed, I always knew it was greed that killed them.  And, you know, the sleazeballs around them, they should be held accountable.  Wow.  Well, I'm looking forward to seeing this movie, if it's actually something that's going to happen.  Oh, it's happening.  All right, good.  A few-hour flick.  Yeah.  You know, why do you think I've been in L.A. all these months?  See?  He's been hiding out, he said, over the past few months.  Post-production.  That's what he's doing.  Sure. 
[03:11:00]  Ian, we've got to move on, because we've got to take a break.  Anything else?  You good?  Yeah, there's one other thing.  It goes back to this.  I have a blind item for you this week.  Oh, we like the blind item.  The governor of New York.  Yeah, the governor.  Who's the governor now?  Oh, a blind guy.  That's why he said what he said.  What's the prerequisite for being governor of New York these days?  You have to be, and you have to be.  Okay, sorry.  Go ahead, by the way.  Yeah, I think it's, you know, you've got to be blind and have a boner on in that town to be governor. 
[03:11:30]  You know what, Dave from Philly has a very good thought here.  Yeah, let me get to my blind item.  Ian Halpern is proud of the fact that he was better in shape than a 95-pound Oxycontin addict.  Yeah, that wasn't really saying much, Ian.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, you're right.  Okay.  I understand my cock is bigger than Macaulay Culkin's when he did Home Alone. 
[03:12:00]  When he was young.  All right, why don't we do this blind item?  That's when we did Home Alone.  We're silly today.  I like the explainer.  A famous CEO who is allegedly dead is actually alive in Israel selling online kosher health care products.  Ted?  Ted, the CEO?  Yes, the famous American CEO.  I'm saying he faked his death. 
[03:12:30]  I would say that would be Eddie.  Who the fuck faked?  Eddie.  From Crazy Eddie.  What's his name?  Eddie.  Ansar.  Eddie.  Eddie Atner.  Ansar.  Antlers.  Eddie.  Is it a guy from Crazy Eddie?  No.  Is he insane over there in Israel?  No.  What's he selling over there?  Kosher.  I'm not buying kosher health care products.  Bacala.  Kosher health care products?  Yeah, they got to be kosher.  What is that?  Like what?  They just got to be blushed. 
[03:13:00]  What is one kosher?  A thermometer with no pork in it?  Eddie Atner, I think.  You can't use electricity over there in Israel sometimes, and you might have a machine that  needs electricity so that you get a kosher one.  Ah, I got you.  Really?  Yeah.  Right in.  Help me out here with this.  Yeah.  See?  They have stuff on timers, by the way.  Yeah, and they have stuff on timers.  Things on timers.  They're not allowed to turn electricity on and off, so some of these coatings, that's  right, they're on timers, so you're not officially turning it on or off.  But you are, because you set the timer.  But then the elevators. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, but you set the timer when you were still allowed to touch the electronics.  And elevators stop on every floor.  That's because they're old prime minister.  So they could just walk in.  Sharon, they're keeping on life support.  So he's the only guy with constant electricity on.  Everyone else, they're on rations.  Why do they stop?  Sharon, he's still alive, this guy.  He's been in a vegetable.  Yeah, we forgot about him, huh?  They didn't even have electricity back when they wrote this, so how do they know it's  bad?  In 2007, the guy, do you think Sharon's ever going to, you know, go to a Yankees game  again? 
[03:14:00]  I don't think he ever went to one to begin with.  Well, I think it's time we bring him to throw out the first pitch in the state he's in.  I am?  Yeah.  All right, so a CEO is doing this.  I don't even know any dead CEOs.  I know.  So this blind item sucks.  You know this guy.  We do.  This guy was a big deal.  When did he supposedly die?  Yeah.  In the last few years.  Ken Lay?  Hey.  Figure it out.  Ken Lay.  Thank you, Dave C. from New York City.  Figure it out. 
[03:14:30]  Who's Ken Lay?  Do we know this guy?  No one ever saw the body.  Who the fuck is Ken Lay?  That guy?  I don't know that guy.  How do I know this guy?  This is going to make news when I start going out with this on my site.  Yeah?  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah, ha.  CEO of Hard Rock killed himself.  Randy Kwasniewski. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, and there's a little Jewish thing in his name there.  Oy.  Randy Kwasniewski.  What about that, Ian?  Look, you guys are warm.  That's all I could say.  Oh.  Let me ask you a question.  If I get Larry King off the air, will you guys take the slot if I can get you a bit?  I don't feel like it.  9 o'clock at night.  9 to 10.  I don't do TV.  You guys are slaving away five, six hours a day.  Yeah, you're right.  What if I get you an hour a day and then I boot out Cooper and His Highness takes the  10 to 11 slot?  So you're planning on taking over CNN with our help? 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, because they're raining sucks.  They're raining sucks.  I kind of like it.  I know for a fact, if you put you guys on, and then His Highness up to bat next, and Norton  on both shows, we're going to knock these people out of the park.  So we're your lead in?  Yeah, you guys, you know, you're batting third.  His Highness only bats clean up.  I'm the A-Rod of talk entertainment.  Oh, Ken Lay's the Enron guy.  Yeah. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, I didn't know that.  Or is it Henry Ford someone's saying?  Hey, Ford, man.  I don't know.  You know what Ford's doing today?  As Norton says, he's staring at the door.  Grump alert.  Grump alert.  Grump alert.  Look, could I just say something?  Yeah, sure.  Can Keith put his fucking clothes on and get out of my backyard?  What is he doing?  With his fucking ass saying, he's laying down on one of my fucking chase lounge.  Butt-ass naked. 
[03:16:30]  What awful white cheeks.  He's just laying in my yard.  Hey, baby ass, get up.  Baby ass.  Tell baby ass to get up.  Oh, God.  He knows he's on camera and he just ran away.  He just ran away.  Goodbye, baby hiney.  Get the fuck off of my furniture.  Why is he naked in your backyard?  He's going to put desinex on his balls.  What a child, hiney.  He was like humping the fucking chase lounge. 
[03:17:00]  He ran out because those black workers were getting undressed in the other thing to come  over and give him a good rogering.  He needs some justice.  Remember, you arrested me back in uh-oh.  Oh, shit.  No, this is how they get tickets fixed.  They give him a good rogering.  He needs butt paste.  Keith likes a good rogering from Black Gentleman.  Why is he naked in your backyard?  And why can you see it from here?  Oh, I can pop up all of my security cameras.  I know.  I'm just fucking setting it up so the audience knows what the fuck's going on.  Yes, exactly. 
[03:17:30]  So what I was doing is I was watching some of the gentlemen, some of the gentlemen opening  my pool for the season.  My pool is being opened for the season.  Yay.  And apparently, oh my God.  What?  He said my neighbor lady was looking out the window and yelling.  If she thinks that's me, I swear to God.  Oh, that's awesome.  And even if she doesn't, why is there a naked man in my yard? 
[03:18:00]  Keith, could you knock it off?  She was yelling at him?  Yeah, apparently that's why he got up so quick.  You're allowed to be naked in your backyard, right?  I don't know, but sunbathing nude?  No, there's people living next door that could kind of see.  So?  That's their problem.  Build a fucking tall fence.  I don't know what the, you know, protocol is, but I don't want them thinking like, oh  my God, Anthony's out there with his ass hanging out, or Anthony has naked men in his yard.  Wow, do I hope the papers grab that rent boy scandal on Long Island? 
[03:18:30]  You son of a bitch.  Notorious homophobe Anthony Cumia and a police officer were embroiled in a sexual controversy.  Officer Keith, known as baby ass to friends and men of color.  Ian's still on the line, I think.  Oh, this is terrible.  I got breaking news.  Yeah.  Heather Locklear.  Yep.  Just in.  Had an affair with Roseanne Barr three years ago. 
[03:19:00]  Heather Locklear and Roseanne Barr.  Get the fuck out of here.  Three years ago.  Why are you saying that?  I just got a tip on him.  You just got a tip.  Yeah?  Heather Locklear and Roseanne.  And Roseanne, that's an odd thing I've never heard of.  Hold on, we got Keith on the hotline.  Okay, hold on, hold on.  Ian, stay on the line, man.  We're doing radio with you right now.  Keith.  Enjoy.  Yeah.  Keith.  What happened?  Now, does the neighbor think that I have gay, naked men in my yard? 
[03:19:30]  Dude, she's yelling out the window.  And she's from next door, the Greek lady.  What did she say?  The one to the left, if you look at the house.  And then all the Orientals are in the yard in the back, too.  What did she say, though?  Did she yell?  She just looked out the window and started yelling.  So I grabbed my clothes and I ran up to the house.  You ass.  What are you doing?  Why are you taking your clothes off in my yard?  Yeah, no, you should say that for inside the house, like normal.  Well, because I have the car club car, so I don't have keys. 
[03:20:00]  So I'm bored.  I have nothing to do.  I'm waiting for Ange to get here to let me in.  Oh, you can't get in the house?  No.  Oh, that's a...  You don't know the trick?  No, I don't know the trick.  Yeah, there's a trick.  I'll show you.  Well, I don't know the trick.  I figured I'd just lay out naked in your yard.  Tell him the trick.  I ain't going to tell him the trick on the air.  Why?  Just tell him the trick.  I'm not telling him the trick.  Anthony keeps a spare key under the little black fellow holding the lantern. 
[03:20:30]  Well, actually...  Oh!  Then...  I don't, but there actually is...  Oh, is there really?  Well, let me...  I can show you on cam.  It's great.  Yes.  No, uh, uh, yeah.  There's a trick, Keith.  I'll let you know.  I'll text you.  I keep beginning to move that little black guy when the guys to the pool come here to...  Oh, God!  They were there!  Yeah.  For a guy that doesn't like those people, they do a lot of work for you.  I employ a lot of minorities.  You're like the fucking guy at the end of Mississippi burning Clayton Towley when he's being arrested 
[03:21:00]  and his black workers are staring at him.  See?  Look at that, Jimmy.  See?  That's, uh...  My little, my little, uh, lawn jockey lantern.  They must hate you so much.  And, and...  The hose is going right until they saw it.  I know, and I'm looking, and obviously they saw it.  Oh, Keith.  You had to have.  They were all around, huh?  They were all around up there.  Oh, my God.  They're probably very angry.  Oh, well. 
[03:21:30]  All right.  Stay off...  Stay...  Stay off of my fucking chairs with your cock.  Ten bucks if you rub your fucking...  Rub, rub your dick and balls all over his pillows.  No!  Ten bucks?  No.  I'm going to lay backwards so the face is there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He'll do it for free.  What are you kidding?  Ten bucks?  And I've contacted...  And I was talking on the phone.  I've contacted an attorney about the pool because this is ridiculous now.  Yes!  Wait, have you really?  Yeah.  Yes, I did.  I just got off the phone with somebody.  I don't know where all the water goes. 
[03:22:00]  Well...  It's a full pool when they cover it, and then when they uncover it, it's an empty pool,  and no one knows where the water went.  Wow, that's...  The whole thing's horrific.  Are you contacting an attorney about that or about the fixing it, the coloring it in  or whatever issue?  And look, look at the walls, the discoloration...  Everything.  Everything.  It's horrific.  The guy that put this in is a fucking motherfucker.  That guy.  By the way.  I talked to the guy, and I talked to my lawyer friend, and he's going to talk to us when  you get home.  Sue everyone! 
[03:22:30]  By the way, real quick, when the Fios guy came to install me with my Fios, he did tell  me that he's petrified because they don't want to be another pool guy.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So he made sure to do a very good job.  Oh, very good.  That's good.  You're a part of the Fios family now, Danny.  Officially, yes.  How do you feel?  Liberated.  Isn't it great?  It's very nice.  Gotta love.  Fuck you, Cablevision.  What does that pool guy say?  You ask him time after time.  What's he been saying?  It's just an excuse.  It's this. 
[03:23:00]  And then they just don't take calls, and they disappear.  He doesn't make money off fixing his pool.  Exactly.  That's how all those...  Not all those guys, but a lot of guys...  That's how they work.  It's two seasons old, and it looks like it's been used in fucking...  It looks like fucking...  Costello's baby drowning.  All right.  Well, we'll see what the attorney says.  Andy's got here, so I can...  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Go in the house.  All right.  Good.  Go in the house and keep your fucking clothes on.  Ian Halpert's still on the line here.  All right.  Ian, you going to sing us out or anything? 
[03:23:30]  Because we've got to go now.  Yeah.  Well, I'll just say peace out to everyone.  Peace out.  I'm coming back to New York, and it's just been wild.  Bonne journée à tout le monde.  Jim Norton à Montréal, en joueur pour le Festival de Jusperville.  Thank you, sir.  Are you going to be up there at all at the end?  That's very nice.  Good luck at the festival, yes.  Yes.  Break a leg.  Absolutely.  He's going to be the biggest hit Montreal's ever had.  I haven't been there in a while.  Are you going to be up there at all this summer for the festival?  I'm going to be in the front row.  All right.  Good.  I'll see you up there.  All right.  I'm going to be bringing every gorgeous chick to your show in Montreal. 
[03:24:00]  Thank you.  You know, we're going to pack that place.  Which venue are you playing?  Plasté's Art?  It's on Club Soda.  Oh, Club Soda.  That's a good venue.  Yeah, yeah.  It sells out every night.  Is it really?  13 shows, yeah.  Club Soda.  Really?  A Club Soda.  It's called Club Soda.  It's a theater.  How many does that seat?  Like 500, 600 people?  It's a great club.  Yeah, it's about 650.  I've played there many times on saxophone.  It has amazing, gorgeous ushers.  And you're right in the heart of the action. 
[03:24:30]  There's a strip club right across the street.  It's called Cleopatra's.  I may have my brud with me.  Then again, maybe I won't.  How long have you been with this chick?  I have close to a year.  Oh, yeah?  Already?  Are you in love, man?  Do you ever get, you know, the temptation to look around or touch?  Everyone's tempted to look.  Yeah.  We all look, but it's like, you know, doing something.  It's like, eh.  Yeah, that's it.  But the key is, you know, you could look, but you don't have to touch. 
[03:25:00]  Let me tell you guys, next week, I have the biggest scoop.  I will reveal it exclusively on your show.  Why don't you do it now?  If you know there's going to be a scoop, then you know what it is.  If I reveal it now, you guys are going to wonder if it's true or not.  I'm actually going to bring the person on directly on your show next week.  And this is going to make huge headlines in the next few weeks.  I'm going to reveal it exclusively on your show.  I'm in disguise, but I'm gay. 
[03:25:30]  It's going to be a blockbuster segment next week.  I promise you.  He's promising a blockbuster next week.  A world exclusive on ONA.  A world exclusive, a blockbuster.  We would appreciate that.  All right.  Ian, thank you for being so patient.  You rule.  With our shenanigans.  All the best in the delivery room.  Thank you, sir.  And Anthony, I want to see you on CNN 9 o'clock,  because Larry King is the most boring motherfucker on TV right now.  Oh, what I'd love to. 
[03:26:00]  Rumor has it I'm taking over for Larry King, by the way.  Yeah, you guys, anyhow, next week, I promise you.  And if I don't deliver, just axe me right then and there.  Next week, it's a blockbuster.  All right, see you again.  Axe you what, motherfucker?  See, that's a black joke.  Throw me the stairs.  See, because they say axe instead of ask.  All right, here's going.  Yeah.  All right.  Next week's the big one.  All right.  All right.  Hopefully it is.  All right.  Keep that push.  All right, there you go.  Thank you.  Wow, there's Ian Halpern. 
[03:26:30]  I love him.  He was a trooper for hanging in during a long.  We had a lot of shenanigans going on.  Wow, look at how fast that time went.  With all that going on, I'm sure we only got about 18 reads to do in 20 minutes.  Really?  Yes.  When the Beezit girls was here, I'm like, I'm glad the Beezits ain't stinging, everybody.  Hey, we got another clip from the drum show. 
[03:27:00]  From the drum show.  The surprise drum show.  This is an Anthony request.  Yeah.  I lied for this one.  I mean, it's a voicemail that Danny's mom.  We talked about.  But you actually played the voicemail?  Yeah.  We just talked about it.  It was.  No, no.  I saved the voicemail for over a year.  And you don't bring it to the show that pays your fucking.  I didn't know what to do with that.  What voicemail?  Oh, my God.  What's for the drunk show?  Everybody is.  No, it's not that.  The problem with this show is that all the guys have radio shows.  So why would they bring stuff to.  They're hoarding. 
[03:27:30]  Why would they bring stuff to the actual show that is paying their bills?  Wait, what's the voicemail?  It's.  You've had this for a year.  About.  We could have made something out of this.  Maybe.  But I never wanted to hand it in being like, oh, you know, look at me.  I want airtime.  Play my stuff.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, it just would have been weird to hand it in like that.  No one listens.  No one listens Saturday.  Don't worry.  What's the show?  No one listens.  We have the voice.  It's growing.  Yeah, it's in the track.  It's growing.  But.  What the fuck?  Let's hear it.  I got into an argument.  I was busting my mother's balls when I was still talking to her. 
[03:28:00]  You don't talk to her anymore?  No.  This is the last contact I've ever had with her was this voicemail being played.  But she used to hang out with us.  Yeah, she used to.  We talked about this on the drunk show.  Wait, how?  Yeah.  Oh, a lot of these questions are going to be answered in this clip?  Probably not.  What was the last time you saw her?  Yeah.  Probably at an event somewhere.  F.H. Reilly's, I remember, the whole family was there.  You, your little brother, your mom was trying to pick up people.  Oh, boy.  I know.  I know. 
[03:28:30]  I think I know why the guys save stuff, to be honest.  I think that we don't use our resources well enough and go to them enough.  Like, why would Danny think she should say that and bring it in when we haven't talked  to him about his personal life in a while?  He might think, like, I don't want to be a burden.  You had that, though.  You're getting on the air right away.  It's not even a bridge.  It's just, like, who the hell is going to give a fuck about this message that my mother  left me on my voicemail?  But if it was an ongoing theme and we've been talking to Danny more, then it would be  something like he'd be comfortable bringing in.  Like, if it was, you know, Dan's mom, then it makes sense to bring to the table.  He's got that whole bit going, so I'm not going to jump in with my fucking voicemail. 
[03:29:00]  What the hell's wrong with you guys?  We don't like our mommies.  We like our guys that work for us to hate their moms.  That's pretty much almost across the board.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Does Travis hate his mother?  I know they don't have a good...  Yeah.  Wait.  Yeah.  Why?  Well, they don't have a relationship.  All right.  Hold on.  Everyone with a mommy issue.  Hold on, Travis.  Wow.  Everyone with a mommy issue lineup.  Yeah.  Well...  We've got Dan.  We've got Danny.  We've got Travis.  Who else? 
[03:29:30]  Sam's fine.  Sam's got to be in love.  And she makes him fish sticks or whatever.  Mother of the year, this Sam's mom.  Chicken nuggets, whatever the fuck that infant eats.  And Steve.  E-Rock?  Mommy issue?  Steve's got it.  I have a mom issue.  Steve's got mommy issue written all over him.  Steve, mommy issue?  Yes.  I want to be one.  Travis, mommy issue?  So what's the mommy issue?  She left seven years ago.  Oh, boy.  I haven't spoken to her since.  Oh, Jesus.  Why?  Why'd she leave? 
[03:30:00]  In my opinion, I think she just had like a midlife.  She had a homosexual son.  She saw the cat picture.  Don't talk about my brother.  Wait.  How old, Travis, are you now?  I'm 27.  So she was 20.  You were a grown man.  Do you have younger siblings?  Yeah.  How old?  He's a year younger than me.  Okay, so you're both grown up.  And you haven't talked to your own mom in seven years?  No.  Why?  Do you know where she is?  No.  You don't even know where she is?  No.  Why'd she leave?  It can't be just a midlife crisis.  You know, in the first place.  Oh, Jesus. 
[03:30:30]  Has she tried to contact you?  Oh, no.  I was, when she left originally, I was the one keeping contact with her.  Oh, okay.  So she left and then you were still kind of keeping contact.  But she cut off contact with everyone.  Oh, okay.  Like, me, my brother, her brother.  Wow.  Everyone.  Did she start up a new family?  Yeah.  Well, what happened was she married a Jewish guy.  A Jew.  Who I think his, like, level of faith is to cut off your previous life. 
[03:31:00]  Make my day, Jew.  When you convert.  Did she convert?  Yeah.  And when you convert, I think you cut off that part of your life.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Fuck it.  Whoa.  That is something.  I haven't spoken to her in seven years.  That doesn't sound very Christian.  Oh, it isn't.  He obviously has a huge cock.  Oh, yeah.  Jesus.  He's fucking cock.  That's what Jewish guys are known for.  That's what makes it even more amazing. 
[03:31:30]  He's knocking that fucking goyim pussy in the fucking mess with her.  They're all high-fiving him behind his scenes.  Oh, yeah.  This guy must be a stud in bed that she's given up everything for.  She fucking, she pretty much.  Cock, Travis.  I guess so.  She changed gods.  Yeah.  She changed gods.  Denounced Christ.  Denounced Christ.  Got rid of her previous family all for the cock.  Renounced.  Yeah.  She fucking never looked at it that way.  She fucking gave up. 
[03:32:00]  I like denounced.  How about pronounce?  Yeah.  How about pounce?  Like she did on that fucking Jewish fucking clipped piece of meat.  That fucking, I bet his cock is so fat it has a yarmulke.  Fucking sweaty cock head he has in a little yarmulke.  His pubes are curled like payas around his balls.  That's right.  He fucking puts a little briefcase with money and he fucking handcuffs it to his cock shaft.  He's fucking, I don't mean to be disrespectful to your mother.  Oh, none taken.  But for seven years, she has been taken from kosher seed on the fucking, on the face and in the hair. 
[03:32:30]  Sorry, man.  I became a little bit challenged.  Oh, it's his mom.  Oh, he hasn't seen her in seven years.  You know what it is, he's only fucking religious women for.  So when he got, he got a hold of her and the way she, like, he never had a finger in his  asshole before.  But fucking boy, when, when that fucking, when that, when that fucking Christian hand reached  around.  Yeah.  He's like, why are you putting your finger in your mouth?  And she went, hold on a second.  Keep your hat on and I'll show you. 
[03:33:00]  She's wetting her finger.  She's the first one to ever pull the sheet down and expose her big tits.  Say, why don't you come on these, Morris?  Oh my God.  Morris.  He's never had that before.  Ever.  Well, let's ask Travis.  Travis, does your mom have big tits?  No.  Oh, damn. 
[03:33:30]  I bet she got implants.  I'll bet you.  Morris likes big tits and she had them blown up.  Fuck.  She's like fucking Colonel Kurtz.  Yeah.  Fuck the kids.  Fuck that cat.  My faggot son.  I got Jew dick.  Anything for you, Morris.  Whatever you are.  Jew dick.  Sell the husband.  Sell the kids.  I'm never coming back.  Are you a rabbi, Willard?  I'm a cop.  She likes that, huh?  Wow.  Yeah.  Jimmy's basically saying your mom's loose. 
[03:34:00]  No, I'm saying it's true.  No, she was so taken.  I don't know.  Maybe.  She was so taken.  Yeah.  Like, so, like, you know what I mean?  It's like a lot of times you're a mom and you fucking, you know, you go through that crisis.  She's probably never had it like that.  You read her diary.  The first entrance was, oh, oh my God.  Oh, my former God.  Oh, my you-know-who.  Florida Steve from Washington, D.C. writes, she screams, I want to taste my ass. 
[03:34:30]  I never had anyone go ass to mouth before.  Oh, Travis.  Oh, no.  Seven years, you got married, and she didn't see you get married, huh?  No.  Does that bother you?  No.  Come on, a little bit's got to hurt.  No.  You must have not had a great relationship growing up with your mom, then.  No, that's the thing, is that we had a great relationship.  Oh, no!  No, she was like-  Terrible.  She was like the mom, you know, like, that you want to have.  Yeah.  I think my brother is more affected than I am.  What did daddy do to your mom? 
[03:35:00]  Nothing.  Did you ever call her and say, what the fuck happened to you?  Did they get a divorce, obviously?  Yeah.  At what age?  Uh, I was 20.  Wait, divorce, and then gone?  Yeah.  So she, like, disowned you guys before she, you know, hooked up with this guy, unless she  was seeing this guy.  We don't know.  Oh, I see.  But it was all very quick.  I'm sure it was sneaky.  Did she was pregnant?  No.  I don't believe that you're not hurt, though.  That's a very devastating thing, because all of a sudden she's gone.  No, I dealt with it a long time ago. 
[03:35:30]  Did you ever call her and just go, what the fuck did you leave for?  Painting swastikas on synagogues?  How did you deal with it?  When she left, yeah, all the time.  Nothing.  I mean, like, seven years later.  That's all right.  No.  Like, how could you fucking reject your children?  No, I will probably get in touch with her one day.  Right now, my house is like-  Oh, no, you will?  Well, I figure I will one day, but not right now.  What was her answer when you said, where'd you go?  Oh, that it's none of my business.  Hole.  Really?  Yeah.  How about it is?  Well, yeah, exactly, because when they were going through their divorce, I would try and 
[03:36:00]  cry in front of them to make it stop.  Well, he, the man that she married, luckily for her, was a divorce lawyer.  Ah, a lawyer!  So he got it into her head.  He sure did.  Your son wears a sweater with a hood?  Why would you want to go back to that?  Is he a boy or a girl?  Oh, he had her fucking face in legal pads. 
[03:36:30]  You know, the first time she ever squirted when she came was with her fucking face on  a yellow legal pad.  Oh, my God.  I never had liquid come out before.  Is that pee?  Is that pee?  She panicked.  She thought she pissed at her leg.  I'm sorry, Travis.  I know what you're fucking talking about.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  She thought she fucking pissed into her pantyhose and all over her shoes.  Never seen such a thing.  Fred Ziffel writes, the term ATM means something totally different to Morris. 
[03:37:00]  Oh, she knew it, too.  She would talk dirty.  She'd go, oh, fuck me like you're representing my husband.  Oh, fuck me like you're representing him.  Fuck me like you're Dominic Barber.  And I'm a fucking guinea radio host.  Oh, when you pull your cock out, I want half my bank account to be attached to it.  Fuck me, Morris.  Morris. 
[03:37:30]  Dickie Punchcock from Wack Bag, right?  Dickie Punchcock.  I bet she likes it in the Dirty Star of David.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Let's see.  Ryan from Cleveland.  Does she stick dreidel beads in her ass?  Yeah.  He tore a new asshole.  Oh, no.  He pulled his dick out of her ass and there was a little menorah on there.  Steven S. from Bayshore writes, they're coming in too quick now. 
[03:38:00]  Good God.  So quick, I can't find it anymore.  Oh, well.  Oh, I guess Travis is wishing the tally had been six million and one.  Oh, now we're getting into the gray area here, aren't we?  I guess we're going to have to fire Steven S. from Bayshore.  Sorry, Steven.  Sorry.  Wow, Travis, what the fuck?  You think your dad did something that was pretty wrong that made her go like this?  No. 
[03:38:30]  Really?  Yep.  Is your dad Rudolph Hess?  What does your dad do now?  What does he do now?  Right now, he...  The head of the Ku Klux Klan?  Yeah.  No.  He's looking for Simon Wiesenthal.  The head of the Nazi Party of America.  Yeah.  He's in radio.  My dad, Ivan Demjeniuk?  He's a Detroit autoworker.  Travis's dad is in radio?  Did we know this?  Really?  No.  What's he do?  Travis Stern.  Oh, wow. 
[03:39:00]  He runs a station in Jersey.  He runs a station in Jersey.  What station?  I'd rather not say.  Oh, boy.  How do we not know this?  Don't tell me it's the FM talker.  No, Jim knows.  How do we not know this?  I know, too.  Let me take a look at this.  Oh, I actually like that station a lot.  Let me see.  Yeah, yeah, I did.  I used to like it.  Oh, then I know what it is.  Oh, no, I don't know.  My first radio request was made to that station. 
[03:39:30]  That's how I know.  And I asked them to play The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald, and they never did.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No wonder.  Maybe the guy's name was Edmund Fitzgerald.  The Wreck of the...  And I suck it deep down in her asshole.  She came...  And she came like Lake Gitchaguni.  Could you wear pink socks into this, please?  Please wear pink socks into this.  Oh, let's see.  I gave her jaw a good knock in her ass a pink sock, and I wiped my dick on her son's sweater. 
[03:40:00]  Off the cuff.  Sorry.  On his hoodie.  Oh, poor Travis.  Dickie Punchcock is rocking today.  One more from Dickie, please.  Like a little Travis with the cat.  Do you see the picture of him, Jimmy?  I know.  He's so tussleable.  Hey, let me get this in.  I know.  That's center out.  Let me get one more from Dickie Punchcock in, please.  Dickie Punchcock?  He eats her ass because it smells like pennies. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, shit.  Well, you know what the thing was, too?  That he was used to probably deep fucking and getting them to squirt because he does what  they call hits rock bottom.  Like, I bet you the first thing she said, I mean, again, I'm trying to phrase this properly.  Like, the first thing while she was bent over and he fucking deep-dicked her, where she  probably went like, ugh!  I never knew a cock could go that deep.  Oh, my God.  He hit rock bottom.  Wow.  Hey, the guy's-  Your pussy's as tight as my wallet? 
[03:41:00]  The guys are trying to guess the call letters of the station that Travis's wallet is at.  WCKLD.  That's cuckold.  That's what this guy's got.  Oh, really?  You're going to be pissed that John from Virginia's going to be mad.  John, I can't see feedback from here.  No, he can't.  Very good, Jimmy.  You nailed that one.  All right.  Oh, Danny.  We go to Danny's mother issues.  Anything else you want to add to this, Travis? 
[03:41:30]  No.  I mean, this is all-  You say you want to search her out at some point, though?  Well, Jim asked if I want to get in touch with her.  Yeah, and you do.  No, not that I do right now, but I assume that later on in life-  Why would you even assume that?  You've got to assume at this point she's got a seven-year-old that is named Travis.  Maybe.  Why would they ask you to reject your former life?  Without having any feelings or anything, you wouldn't even consider that the future might hold this reunion.  Is this a hopeful thing?  No.  To be honest with you, it's not something that I think about. 
[03:42:00]  How could you not hate her guts, even if you made up with her, like, because she left her-  I would more like to get in touch with her to find out, like, because, you know, that affected me so much when it was happening.  Yeah.  You know?  Not the divorce or not the remarriage, but the rejection of you and your brother.  Yeah, just the rejection of everyone.  Like, she hasn't spoken to her own brother in seven years.  Wow.  Did you, um, when you were growing up, did you think she was a little off?  No.  Wow, so fucked up.  You never saw anything, like, that would indicate that she was going to- 
[03:42:30]  No, nobody did.  Was she like the regular mom?  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  God damn.  Boy.  Boy.  You never really look at the Jewish people as the ones that kind of come in and sweep a woman away like that.  Drowned victim from Jersey writes, uh, this is what he thinks the radio station call letters are.  W, my mom left me for cut cock.  That's a little long.  I don't think the FCC allows that.  Put that on a bumper sticker. 
[03:43:00]  Oh, my God, that's it.  No offense to your dad, but he's unclipped.  Oh, my God, that's it.  It was the first-  She actually-  The first thing she said was,  Oh, my God, it tastes so clean.  Oh, fuck.  Jimmy.  I'm just teasing.  Don't even look at him, Jimmy.  I can't.  Yeah, you really can't.  He's right there, too.  Very bad.  Don't look to the right.  He's right there.  I can't.  I have a voicemail.  Yes. 
[03:43:30]  It's not about you, douchebag.  You got enough air time last weekend, Dan.  Oh, shit.  All right, what do we got, Danny?  So we got the-  This is audio.  Chavis, we're not going to forget that one anytime soon.  No, no.  All right, hey, so Anthony did the surprise drunk show with Danny?  No, it was just a drunk-  Secret show.  Secret.  Oh, mine is a surprise show that I decide I'm not doing because it's your thing.  Yeah.  Secret drunk show.  Secret drunk show.  Yeah.  Here's another clip from Saturday night. 
[03:44:00]  She had two fur coats.  Why would you need that?  Two.  Because she's a cunt.  Oh.  So anyway, the last time-  The last-  When you call your mom that-  Dude, she ain't, though!  That's just going to escalate into mental fucking problems later in life.  And I never want to bring this up or anything.  I don't want to-  Like, it's usually this deathbed scenario that makes that tragic.  Because then, all bets are off.  You forget about the awful shit. 
[03:44:30]  You're just sitting there going,  Okay, here's the one dropping dead,  and I have years now of regret that I'm going to have to fucking sift through.  Oh, fuck.  Are you in a-  Your future stinks!  Well, you know what?  Maybe.  Perhaps.  Yeah.  But the voicemail-  And it wasn't even left to me,  and this is the best part about this probably whole story,  but the voicemail was actually left to my father,  and my father felt the need to call me and leave this for me, 
[03:45:00]  because he liked it so much on my voicemail.  Nice one.  Fits more beer!  I'm almost done with this bottle.  It's a little pissy at the bottom.  So I think we have that queued up.  Hey, Dave, it's Sue.  It's about a quarter to one.  I know you're in school,  but when you do get a chance,  please call me back,  because I had this conversation with Danny,  and I basically told him to fuck off.  And I just want to tell you about it,  because he's the cruelest,  the cruelest, heartless, 
[03:45:30]  old person that I've ever known in my life.  I can't even believe he came out of me.  I really can't.  Bye.  Holy shit.  Dude, where's the tears behind that laughter?  Where are the fucking tears behind that laughter?  Dude, none.  That is probably the worst message you could hear from your mom.  That sounds like something.  Hold on, plug it up one second.  She could say,  no, let's just talk over it,  then it sounds like we were there.  It reminds me of a voicemail I heard 
[03:46:00]  that Travis's mother left.  It's like, oh my God,  I have to deny that he ever came out of me.  Is that inappropriate?  Sorry, Travis.  I feel fucking bad.  Oh, and you should.  Poor Travis.  Such a little innocent boy.  That's why I was hiding behind that beard.  You know what I noticed on that little clip?  Is that what you're calling it?  The beard?  What I noticed on that clip is that your mom sounds very hot.  Courtney Love hot.  No, she's not.  She's got a Courtney Love hot to her voice. 
[03:46:30]  No, she was very emotional,  because she probably left that message for my dad  maybe no more than five minutes  after me and her just had a huge blow up on the...  It was just done.  What does a son and a mother argue about  at this point in your life?  Well, it had a lot to do with  just the cuntiness of the divorce process.  And just like...  My dad, he was going through some rough times.  He had a heart attack.  He had health issues. 
[03:47:00]  He lost his gig,  so he was just working like shitty jobs.  And she was still trying to fuck him  for every fucking cent that she could get out of him.  And she's doing way better than he is.  Yeah.  Forever.  And she's still at it.  Because she was still at it.  She was still at it.  And I tried, you know,  and I wasn't being malicious, I guess,  or up with her,  but I was just busting her balls.  Just kind of like, you know,  kind of having fun with it,  but it was kind of like a half...  Not passive-aggressive,  but I was just kind of, you know,  toying with her a little bit  because I felt like I had the right to  because, you know,  she was trying to fuck my dad. 
[03:47:30]  Oh, yeah, okay.  She had no part of it.  That makes sense.  Wow.  Is there a clip?  Yeah, it's probably nothing.  A message you could hear from your mom.  Dude, there's none tears.  She could say,  thank God he was adopted.  You didn't know.  Thank God he was adopted.  There's none tears.  God, I'm so sorry that abortion didn't work out.  He fucking dodged the hanger.  That's awful.  That was the last communique I've ever had 
[03:48:00]  with dear old mom.  That was it.  That was a while ago, too.  But she gave you birth.  She gave you life.  That's all she did, though.  She gave you life.  That's all she did.  Anybody could take cum in their pussy.  Anybody could do that.  Travis could do that.  His mom certainly can.  It doesn't mean that you're going to be a great mom.  And it doesn't mean that I'm now legally bound to love you  because you took a load on my dad's birthday. 
[03:48:30]  Was it his birthday?  Yeah, well, let's see.  His birthday is March 19th.  My birthday is December 27th.  You do the math.  Yeah, it was a birthday fuck.  So it was a drunken fuck, you think?  Yeah, it had to be.  That's the only reason you're here?  Because of a drunken fuck?  Yeah, because my dad wanted to get laid on his birthday.  Wow.  Okay, we did a lot today on this fine show.  Yes, we did.  Damn. 
[03:49:00]  You two, that makes Thanh's relationship with his mom look like fucking, yeah,  leave it to Beaver.  Wow.  Yeah, way to kill my bitch.  I don't want to seem normal, you dick.
