<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a promotion for Jim Brewer's Comedy Central special, followed by discussion of Jim Norton's successful, albeit oddly sedate, Boston stand-up performance.  A substantial portion focused on the hosts' ire towards Continental Airlines' pricing and service, contrasting it favorably with their experiences with JetBlue. A listener's claim that JetBlue had cameras on its flights prompted a humorous exchange, leading to the cancellation of further calls for that segment.  They then recounted a negative experience with ValueJet (later identified as AirTran), recalling a near-refusal to fly due to its history and poor facilities.

The show abruptly shifted to the shocking news that they had been dropped from a station in Austin, Texas, without explanation.  Opie and Anthony expressed outrage at the station's lack of communication and speculated about the reasons for their dismissal, suggesting a move towards right-wing programming and advertiser pressure. They vehemently criticized the station's perceived cowardice and lack of backbone in the face of complaints, launching into a broader critique of American culture's perceived lack of decisiveness and willingness to offend.

Next, the hosts discussed a Boston contest where the prize was an Aerosmith MTV Icon event trip to Los Angeles. The winning entry, a bucket containing a listener's spleen, was subsequently eaten by another listener, prompting graphic descriptions and audio playback.  The hosts expressed varying degrees of disgust and amusement, with Anthony revealing a profound phobia of human organs.  They then promoted the contest for New York City listeners, hoping for even more outrageous entries.  Lewis Black joined them in the studio, discussing his upcoming Comedy Central special and CNN appearance, sharing humorous anecdotes, including observations about casino gamblers.

The spleen-eating incident became a major focus, delving into the potential health risks, including the effects of formaldehyde as a preservative (a dialysis nurse called in to explain this).  Discussions included the possibility of disease transmission,  and other bizarre stories from the show's past were recounted, including a woman eating a piece of Stockbroker Dave's vas deferens and a previous Aerosmith-related incident.  The segment heavily emphasized the graphic and shocking nature of Mike's actions and the show's past stunts.

The final segment involved a protracted and increasingly frustrating on-air attempt to resolve a conflict with a staff member, Earl, who had ceased communication.  Despite the hosts' attempts, involving producer Frenchy and psychic Ricky, the cause of Earl's anger remained unclear until a one-sided conversation revealed it stemmed from a hidden camera prank and an insensitive on-air joke about his race. The show concluded with further discussion of both the Austin situation and the spleen incident, including a call from the spleen-eater himself, who confirmed illness and a subsequent breakup with his girlfriend.  Multiple phone numbers were provided throughout the show for listener interaction.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  A little piece of Jim Brewer, our buddy, our pal.  We were there when he taped that in.  The hokey pokey, ACDC style.  And that's going to be on his Comedy Central special, which airs Sunday, April 21st at 10 p.m.  A lot of people confused.  They thought it was the end of the show and we left early.  But no, it's the beginning of the show.  Just helping our pal out with a little promotion there, you know? 
[00:00:30]  A little Brewer bit.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including...  Yes?  Cleveland!  A place Jim Norton will be this Friday night.  Cleveland!  Cleveland, Ohio.  I don't know if we're going.  We're trying to work out details with the station.  I hope we get to broadcast live from Cleveland Friday.  Well, if it's half as fun as the Boston trip was, it would be a pisser, as they say. 
[00:01:00]  Jim Norton.  Jim Norton.  I got to compliment this guy again.  What a show this guy put on.  He killed.  Destroyed.  Only Jim Norton would make people sit down in Avalon.  In Boston.  I've been to that club, I don't know, 50 times.  I've never seen seats in it.  Yeah?  Oh, they were sitting there, they're hanging out, the whole time, dying. 
[00:01:30]  Cringing, laughing, embarrassed.  I bet you all the guys that worked for Avalon after the show were like that son of a bitch, Jim Norton.  Now we got a pulled up 850 chairs.  Bringing up these chairs for the Euro night or whatever they had after you on Saturday.  They actually, I could have done standing, but nobody wants to stand during a comedy.  Because Brewer does like a rock show.  I mean, that's cool.  I can't do that.  It's hard to stand during a comedian.  Yeah, just my nonsense.  Nobody wants to stand to my stupid Seattle jokes.  I just love, though, watching. 
[00:02:00]  I like your Seattle jokes.  Thank you.  I love watching his act and just seeing the people go like, oh, oh, oh.  It's like watching someone being tortured.  Like, the reactions you get from the crowd.  People turn their heads real fast like, did he just say that?  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  I paid for this.  Oh, that's not, that is totally not right.  So, Cleveland Norton coming to your town later on this week.  If I can get airfare, thanks to the scumbag airlines, it's, why do you have to stay over Saturday?  Why?  Even your favorite Continental Airlines? 
[00:02:30]  Dude, I hate Continental.  I can't get.  You love Continental.  What are you doing to yourself?  Imagine having to make reservations for Continental on a Verizon phone.  Norton would just, his head would explode.  This guy loves Continental.  You walk up with your little bag and your preferred customer.  They know him.  Hello, Mr. Norton.  How can you say you hate Continental on a Verizon?  I love their planes.  You even joke and go, look, I'm a preferred flyer.  Look at all those douchebags over there.  They're not preferred flyers.  They've got to sit, you know, stand in line for an hour. 
[00:03:00]  I go right up to the counter.  And they know me, and I'm ready to go.  What do you like about the planes, Norton?  Watch this.  They're new.  They're new planes.  They're new aircraft.  The youngest fleet.  The youngest fleet in the industry.  Right.  But here's my problem with the airline industry and all these scumbag airlines.  If something like 9-11 happens, and they expect bailouts, and they want government help,  but if you want to go somewhere and not stay over Saturday, well, they're going to cram  it in your balloon knot because too bad.  They could care less about people.  I absolutely hate all the pricing in the airlines.  They're scumbags.  That sucks.  $2.50 to come back on a Sunday and $8.61 to come back on a Saturday. 
[00:03:30]  Wow.  Now I can't even get that.  It's $8.61 is the minimum, and I think it's actually a little over...  What is that about?  You want to Cleveland.  Did you try...  Hey, we love Cleveland.  But it's close.  It's not a cross-country flight.  It's an hour flight.  Did you try JetBlue?  They don't go there.  I thought JetBlue went to Cleveland.  No.  That's what I thought, too.  I like the JetBlue.  I would definitely fly them.  And you know what the problem is?  I like Continental's planes, but this pricing thing that the majors do, you're scumbags, 
[00:04:00]  and you wonder why people are running the JetBlue.  What's the policy there?  That amazes me.  All the...  Saturday and Y?  All the airlines do that.  But why?  Like, why do they come up with that?  You can just pull it out of a hat.  There's got to be a reason.  Just so they can get an extra $400 off someone like Jim Norton.  And here's what they'll say.  All right.  What do they say?  That's what I want to say.  Well, the business...  For the business travel, it's really expensive.  Their excuse will be, and I just know the way these little worms think, is that they're knocking  money off for personal travel.  Oh, so it's not a lot of money for Saturday.  We're giving you a discount for this Sunday. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  That's what they would tell you.  That's great.  That's like cash discounts used to be at the pump.  Remember that?  We give cash discounts.  No.  You make us pay more for credit cards.  Right.  No cash discount.  There's no loyalty to you having been a customer of any of these big businesses.  They don't care if you've been a customer for years.  They're just dirtbags.  That's the only thing I hate about all of them.  Yeah.  Is they could care less.  You're talking to some monkey who doesn't know her job.  Just some dummy sitting there.  Gives you nothing. 
[00:05:00]  I want to know how many key entries you have to make for just a little bit of information.  Hi.  Could you check if there's a window seat on that flight?  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was meet the parents.  Yeah.  Well, you see it.  And they're hitting the strange enter or backspace key.  And then they hit it like five times.  They're like, what the hell are they doing?  They do that for everything.  Even like checking into a hotel.  Yeah.  How many keystrokes do you need a hit to get me my room? 
[00:05:30]  I know.  So we've got to give out the phone number for everyone in Cleveland and anywhere else outside  New York listening to us today.  866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW.  Look at Dan from Hoboken already.  If all else fails, you guys can take a Greyhound to Cleveland and get a free handy thrown in.  You get the old reach in the lap when you take Greyhound.  It is absolutely disgraceful the way they stick it in your balloon out like that.  They do it to everyone.  It's not just me, man.  You being a customer of silver or gold member means nothing. 
[00:06:00]  Well, you know something?  They're saying flights are up, people are flying again, and service will only get worse.  Yeah, absolutely.  Remember for like a week after the 11th?  They kissed our ass.  Good.  They'll bring a friggin' bedpan to your seat if you didn't want to get up to take a dump.  They kissed our ass.  Believe me.  But it's a...  Thank you.  Thank you so much for flying.  Thank you.  Obviously, we're getting back to normal.  Right.  They're not kissing our asses anymore.  That's it.  Now they're making up for all the money they lost, so they're hiking the rates are crazy. 
[00:06:30]  I was seeing on TV the other day.  They're just effing dirtbags.  That's why you've got to love places like JetBlue.  These little startups that have good planes.  I hope the majors just...  I was going to say they're awful.  It never happens because they just buy them up.  Let me go to...  Eventually, they do.  Or a value jet thing happens.  No, but those were awful planes.  They bought them from Turkey.  You don't buy anything from Turkey.  Awful planes?  It wasn't a plane.  It was the explosive in it.  No, but they were having major problems anyway.  They were having problems.  A value jet?  Yeah, they were having problems anyway. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, pieces were falling off those things way before they crashed.  Yeah.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, how are you doing?  All right.  I just wanted to tell you that JetBlue isn't that good.  Oh, really?  Why?  They put video cameras on the flight.  What's wrong with that?  I don't know.  It's with the Your Hometown Heroes.  Did you ever hear about that?  No.  No?  Oh, well, it's weird because they have cameras all over the flight.  I'm afraid that you're going to get caught spanking it in the bathroom or something.  Hey, thanks, Chris.  All right.  Because of Chris, we're not taking any phone calls today. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, Chris ruined it for everybody.  You ruined it for everyone, Chris.  We're flowing here on a Monday, and you effed us.  Oh, I'm sorry.  What the hell are you trying to say?  I don't know.  Don't you think...  What do you want me to say?  Don't you...  Don't you think in...  They're Hometown Heroes.  Don't you think in this day that we need cameras on planes, you idiot?  No.  Are you plugging a band, sir?  Stop whacking in the bathroom.  Who cares?  I want cameras on the planes at this point.  What?  Bye, Chris. 
[00:08:00]  Bye.  Look at this tool.  Jim, AirTran is the best new airline.  Let's break the news, Tom.  He's kidding.  Let's break the news.  Hey, Jim.  Yo.  You like AirTran, do you?  Yeah, it's American Air, don't you?  Don't you know what AirTran used to be?  He knows.  He's laughing.  No, what's that?  AirTran, they just slapped a coat of paint on the old planes that used to say,  Value Jet.  New logo, new paint job.  Get them flying again.  Remember how pissed...  Yeah, but they got great deals. 
[00:08:30]  No overnight stays.  Remember how pissed we were all?  Yeah, but we were pussies for, like, not backing out.  Well, we needed the job.  They, uh...  Uh, the people in Atlanta, was it?  Atlanta, yeah.  Yeah, that wanted us, uh, to, to do their, uh, radio show down there.  They wanted to hire us in Atlanta after we, uh, got kicked out of Boston.  Instead, they had to go with their second choice, the regular guys.  Yeah.  Two douchebags that go on FoundryMusic.com every single night to get their...  Get their crap for their radio show.  Almost boop. 
[00:09:00]  Everything from the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge to the MILF contest to the Naughty Nighty contest.  They love it.  Oof.  Yeah, we're not paying attention, you douches.  Go ahead.  They, uh, the station down there says, all right, we're going to fly you down.  We're going to fly you down to have a look around the station, get to know you a little  better, but we're like, oh, cool, you know, we go to the airport, um, we, we are booked  on, uh, Air Tram.  Air Tram.  Which is a value jet.  Yeah, but you know what?  We should have got the hint, because we're going to the airport, it was Logan, I guess, 
[00:09:30]  at the time, right?  Yeah.  And, uh, they didn't even have an area.  No, it was like, uh...  It was a makeshift area that was, just happened to be a, uh, a deserted hallway.  You know when you go up to American Airlines, a Continental...  And it feels good.  ...united.  They got all the computer screens.  Oh, computer screens, counters, as far as you can see.  You know, a big line of people, which sucks, professionals behind the counter, professional  monkeys.  I had to make sure we were in Logan Airport.  I thought we were in Calcutta.  Yeah, all of a sudden, we, we, we go, where's the Air Tram terminal?  They go, oh, it's down that way around the left. 
[00:10:00]  Right there.  Go through the closet and go see...  We go down there, it's a cubby in the wall.  It, it, you know what it was?  You ever step up to, like, uh, fly-by-night rental car service at the airport?  Oh, perfect.  They put them, like, in a little cubby hole?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was Air Tram.  The little cardboard sign that said Air Tram hanging up with a nail, crooked, and one  person there, like, bags?  Yeah.  And we're like, oh, this is great.  Meanwhile, there's some bag.  No conveyor belt for the bags.  No.  Just a guy piling them up on a, whatever, a cart or something.  Yeah, that's all.  And wheeling them off. 
[00:10:30]  Well, and some guy, some guy was on a payphone with an earshot, because we're like, what  is wrong with this airline, man?  I'd never heard of it.  And it's, it's brand new.  Yeah.  It's got to be good.  And yeah.  Go ahead.  Some guy with an earshot of us is on a payphone going, yeah, I'm on, I'm taking this Air Tram  thing.  And, uh, it's Value Jet.  Because this is the company.  It's Value Jet.  They just painted their name and changed the name.  I started.  But it's the same things that Opie goes, that's it.  We're not flying.  I F this.  I started shivering.  Uh, we had to call some people.  They convinced us, no, it's okay.  I'm like, it's not okay. 
[00:11:00]  So then we finally went to the bar and got completely hammered.  We got hammered and took our life into our hands.  That was it.  How stupid are we?  But actually put our lives in somebody else's hands.  Occasionally, you got to do that in life.  Don't that suck, though?  Like, you're pretty much responsible for your life, aside from a safe falling on your head as  you walk down the sidewalk.  You pretty much put yourself or don't put yourself in certain dangerous situations.  Because you don't want to die or you don't want to take those chances.  You mean like the time, uh, I was in Brother Weezer's car in Rochester and almost got killed  going to lunch?  There you go.  You put your life in someone else's hands. 
[00:11:30]  Whether you do it driving with somebody else, it's a decision you make.  Is the person you're going with a good driver?  Have you driven with them before?  Things like that.  But when you are flying and you're getting on AirTran, which you know was Value Jet, uh,  it's a big leap that you're taking there.  You're like, all right, for the next however many hours this flight is, I am completely  out of control of my life and I am putting it in a circumstance that I would rather it  not be in.  Right.  It happens any time you fly, but if you take a reputable airline, you figure you're a 
[00:12:00]  little safer than you are in another one.  But AirTran was like, screw that.  Yeah, it is like Sex with Jim Norton.  You never know.  You're putting your life into his hands.  If he feels like killing again, you know, you're screwed.  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  What's going on?  I used to go out with this girl who lived in Germany, so I was looking for the cheapest  flight possible.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Why?  No, I'll get back to you, but there's something going on in Austin. 
[00:12:30]  Uh, Marty, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  What's up is the only way I can listen to you is on the phone now.  Why?  What happened?  Down in Austin.  They got, uh, Mike.  Who is it?  Not Mike.  Hanish, the guy you were talking about the other day.  Sean Hannity?  Sean Hannity is on Spotify.  Sean Hannity is on when?  No O&A in Austin.  What?  What happened to Austin?  I turned the station on.  First of all, it's impossible to get the station anyway.  It has a weak signal.  You sure you got it in? 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, I checked their webpage.  We were on at this time in Austin.  I checked their webpage.  It said, Introducing from 2 to 5, Sean Hannity.  What's up?  When were they going to tell us?  It says, New to the Juice, the Sean Hannity show between 2 and 5.  That's right.  And then he comes on at 5.  Yeah, who is on at 5?  I have no, um...  Get Jeremy, man.  When were they going to tell us this?  Get that goddamn Austin station on the phone.  Listen, this station is the pits.  They play, I'm originally from Jersey, so I like to hear... 
[00:13:30]  Wait, get the lineup.  I like to hear Tiger Shulman.  I like to hear Tiger Shulman.  Dude, dude, shut up.  Yeah, hold on.  Hold on.  I'm not going to listen to anything else you're saying right this second.  This wasn't even one of the two stations that was going to drop us.  No.  That's why it's so weird.  All right, hold on.  There's the lineup.  Go up again.  They were passing out WOW stickers Friday afternoon.  All right.  They got Imus in the morning.  Sucks.  Then they got Sporting News with James Brown for an hour.  Then the Phil Hendry Show.  Then they got the Sean Hannity Show from 2 to 5.  Then it's the Sporting News Papa Joe Show. 
[00:14:00]  And then Tom Lickass from 6 to 9.  And then they redo the Phil Hendry Show at 9.  Dude, we're not on in Austin anymore.  We're on for like three weeks.  What happened to the juice?  What happened to the juice?  You're lucky not to be on the juice.  Bunch of pussies.  They didn't even have the balls to tell us.  It's a horrible station.  They just tried to sneak it through.  What happened there?  Get Jeremy in here.  All right, Marty, thank you.  Call back with that other story. 
[00:14:30]  We have to.  We're a little distracted right now.  We have to get to the bottom of this.  Austin.  Boy, Opie, that came out of nowhere.  We were on a month.  What happened to the juice on 1370 AM?  Amplitude Modulation.  What the F?  All right, we've got to take a break.  We've got to talk to Jeremy real fast.  Yeah.  This business blows.  I swear to God.  Wow, no one wants to. 
[00:15:00]  Douchebags that are all scared and do things behind your back.  No one wants to tell you anything.  Guys, if you weren't happy with the show, why don't you call someone here in New York?  Yeah.  Holy ass.  This effing business is run by a bunch of scaredy-cat douches.  Yep.  Bunch of spineless wonders.  That's why someone like Dave Dickless in Boston survives as long as he does.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Ugh.  Ugh. 
[00:15:30]  Nothing on the website at all, huh?  Dude.  Did you really care about Austin, Texas, though?  I care that someone is dropping the show without saying anything.  Without even calling our people, you know, to tell us what's going on.  It's like, how about L.A.?  Where the hell's L.A.?  All right, we'll take our first break and, I don't know, maybe.  Let's get to the bottom of this.  We'll get to the bottom of the Austin thing.  Wow.  And also, we have a trip to L.A. to give away to see Aerosmith as part of that MTV icon. 
[00:16:00]  Uh-huh.  You know what we did in Boston.  Yes.  We're going to do the same damn thing here in New York tomorrow.  That's right.  We want to see if you guys can beat out what Boston brought down to WBCM when we were there Friday.  We're looking for the wildest, the strangest, the most unusual thing you could bring to Aunt and I tomorrow afternoon between 3 and 7.  Yep.  The one thing that we decide is the most outrageous or whatever, you will win the trip to L.A. to see the MTV icon thing with Aerosmith, okay? 
[00:16:30]  Easy as that.  And there's a little side thing, too, a little side wager.  The best thing we see tomorrow definitely gets a trip, but if you could also beat what Boston brought us, we'll throw in a little booby prize.  Ooh.  A little something extra, okay?  Something extra.  And what did the winner bring down to Boston?  His own spleen.  His own spleen.  His own spleen.  In a bucket.  A bucket of spleen.  Bucket of spleen.  And then someone decided to eat a piece of this guy's spleen. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Yes, we had cannibalism on the Opie and Anthony show Friday.  Uh-huh.  And we have the audio of the guy eating the spleen in case you had a, you know, dump out of the show yesterday, Friday.  Yeah.  If you had to leave early.  And I want to point out something, Anthony, losing his effing mind while that was all going down.  We'll play the tape next.  I had a problem.  And maybe you could try to explain yourself, okay?  All right.  All right.  And more of your phone calls in New York, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Cleveland, where Jim Norton will be Friday night. 
[00:17:30]  Uh, 866-277-4WOW.  Hey, this is LaJean.  And Morgan from 7Dust.  Holler at a player when you see him on the street.  South side, double wide.  Holler at a player.  The different run.  He's bling.  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Crazy motherfuckers.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Godsmack. 
[00:18:00]  I stand alone.  Yes.  It was good hanging out with Sully from Godsmack after the Norton Show.  Yes.  At Avalon in Boston.  Sully, a huge Jim Norton fan.  I don't know if he's a huge fan, but he's like a buddy.  So he came and, uh, very cool business.  Phenomenal.  It was good to see him again.  Yeah.  Without all the BS.  Yeah.  Like, just a bunch of guys hanging out.  Station politics.  So there you have it.  Well, Anthony, uh, the juice in Austin has dropped the Opie and Anthony. 
[00:18:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show after, uh, maybe five or six weeks.  Yeah.  That's all we were on there.  This is a huge surprise for us.  I swear to you.  We're learning, uh, with you.  There's still two stations that are, uh, thinking about dropping the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah.  One needs a little time before they make the decision, I'm hearing.  Uh, but out of nowhere, Austin, uh, kicks us in the yam bag.  They started, they decided to go, uh, what they call, uh, right-wing talk.  Conservative.  Right-wing talk.  Right-wing talk.  Okay.  They're, um, yeah, they're, they went right-wing political, uh, talk. 
[00:19:00]  They don't want any shenanigans.  No shenanigans.  No shenanigans from their, uh, station down there in Austin.  They want to preach about how, uh, women shouldn't be able to have abortions, I guess.  That's pretty much the, uh, the line of sight on that one.  And they want to, uh, compete with, uh, the big talk station in town, KLBJ.  Is that it?  We want to take on KLBJ.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  So.  A bunch of, they just want to bandwagon 9-11.  That's why conservative talk is so popular. 
[00:19:30]  I mean, it's always rushed.  You know, just a bunch of faggots.  We need someone else to think for them.  Right.  How should I feel about the Middle East?  Just, you bunch of stupid hillbillies.  Eight months too late, you decide to switch.  Where were you in October making the switch when it would have made sense?  Oh, they didn't get enough people telling them what they should do.  So, I guess the Jeff Ward show starts in, uh, a half hour down there in Austin.  We're going to try to get on a show today.  Yeah.  Wish him luck with the big, uh, competition from the juice.  Right.  Why not get on the, uh, competition's show? 
[00:20:00]  This business.  I swear to you.  And wish him luck.  Against the, uh, the juice.  Maybe it just doesn't matter because, uh, only one guy called saying, hey, dude, I tuned  you in today and you're not on.  Boy, that makes us feel good.  That's another example of a crappy AM station that, uh, I just, I have no ambition to be on.  Like, that isn't what we, we intended to do when we wanted to, uh, syndicate.  You know, it's the stations like YSP and BCN. 
[00:20:30]  WJFK.  JFK.  Some solid FM signals, you know.  Yeah, let's, that's what we want.  BUF in, uh, Buffalo.  Cleveland.  Extreme Radio.  I'd rather have, you know, seven, eight solid FMs than 25 friggin' stations just to say  you're on in Omaha.  Omaha!  On some goddamn, I don't know, ham radio that some farmer uses.  Farmer!  So. 
[00:21:00]  So there goes Austin.  Well, we got a huge FM that's gonna, uh, take the O&A show very soon.  I think a week from today, we can announce it finally.  Mike, you freaking wise-ass.  Go ahead, Mike.  What's up, guys?  Go ahead, bro.  Yeah, I guess Austin wasn't laughing in the first 20 minutes, huh?  Yeah.  They weren't laughing in the first.  They had their own rules.  They weren't laughing in the first five weeks.  So we're out.  We're out!  All right, we gotta move on.  That's a surprise, though. 
[00:21:30]  Look at that.  Yeah.  I'm sure they got a couple complaints about the content.  You know, we better take it off, guys.  Down there, the Bible Belt.  It's a good place.  There's only a handful of radio guys that could, um, that know how to do this type of radio.  Mm-hmm.  I'm not saying on air.  I'm saying behind the scenes, you know, uh, that understand it and will nurture it and  support it.  Most of these scumbags, they're all scared.  They wear these $2,000 suits and they don't want, they don't want to offend anyone and they  just want to make as much effing money as possible without any problems. 
[00:22:00]  So this type of radio is doomed.  Doomed!  Mm.  So, all right.  They do have a little, uh...  Huh?  I guess they sent a little news, uh, letter or something to the listeners if you're on  their mailing list.  Oh, really?  That for financial reasons, Opie, we were, uh, dropped.  Financial reasons?  Because they weren't even paying us, to be honest.  They experienced fallout from several major advertisers. 
[00:22:30]  Is this about just our show or, uh, or other shows?  Because I just...  Says, uh, us and, uh, Don and Mike.  Mm-hmm.  That's it.  The fallout from, uh, advertisers and they buckled under.  They caved in and, uh, decided to, um, put other shows in.  There you go.  See, shows that aren't going to piss off, uh...  Right, right.  So, buckle under.  Bunch of wimps.  Bunch of wimps.  And coutowed.  Bunch of, uh, bunch of general manager wimps that, uh, you know, run their stations.  They get one complaint call. 
[00:23:00]  That's all it takes sometimes.  One complaint call.  Like, oh, oh, my God.  Oh, get rid of Opie and Anthony.  Get something a little safe.  God, when the hell are people going to get some balls?  And not even just in this industry.  I'm just talking about...  TV.  Yeah, TV.  The second one friggin' bitch with some letterhead writes a letter with a little organization  atop that her and her coffee-clotched twat bags sit around and think about what they 
[00:23:30]  could bitch about and fire off one letter.  Executives say, oh, oh, oh, we gotta stop doing this then.  We got a letter.  They're a bunch of pussies, and I can only hope people bust in and blow your brains out.  Well, they think they're doing society a favor, you know?  Yeah.  If this continues, if they start homogenizing all of entertainment, I guarantee you'll have  kids all over America strapping bombs on their body and doing the suicide bombing thing 
[00:24:00]  because they have nothing else to do.  Meanwhile, I've seen...  You start dropping Game Boy Advances in the Middle East.  They, you know, they'll have some distractions.  I've seen more death and destruction on the news in the past couple of weeks than I've  ever seen.  It's amazing.  One of the reasons...  Graphic depictions of dead, exploded, shot-up people.  And, you know, don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with it.  I sit there and watch it.  It's news.  I think everybody should know about it. 
[00:24:30]  But don't then say you can't depict it in a drama or in some other context and have  some balls.  I mean, just do it.  Don't pay attention.  The letter writers will go away if you just stick to your guns and have some balls.  Davey from Austin wants in.  Davey!  How y'all?  What's up, Davey?  Not much, man.  I'm just here to call to say we're glad you're off the air down here in Austin. 
[00:25:00]  I didn't know we're off the air.  Because I know who.  I turned on the program to catch that new program.  Oh, yeah, yeah?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yo guys ain't nothing but trash.  And, you know, if you talk about Philly's dead one more time, I ought to break your neck.  Austin sucks.  Philly rules.  You suck.  I'm not from Austin, you cool?  All right.  I'm completely in that pool when I might be on the radio talking about what you guys  are still a cop killer.  We're all going to hang up on your sorry asses.  All right.  Thank you, Davey. 
[00:25:30]  Later.  Bastard.  And you have to make the problem with the advertisers are just dirtbags.  They won't advertise like Coke and all these other stomach-ruining products.  They don't want to advertise on your show because it's expensive.  And meanwhile, they'll still sell their products in South Africa and places, you know,  like where blacks are murdered.  It's just really aggravating.  Well, that image, it's about a fake image that the advertiser wants to present.  It has nothing based in reality.  They want people to perceive them as a nice, gentle company.  Meanwhile, you have companies that are family-oriented, clothing that is being stitched together 
[00:26:00]  by some poor, legless dink kids making no money.  But they present themselves as, you know, hey, we're a nice American family company.  And the reality of it is there are kids being tortured, sewing this crap together.  Another thing, yeah, you mentioned fast food places that don't want to advertise.  They're too busy clogging up people's hearts until they explode. 
[00:26:30]  But the image, hey, it's a great family place.  You come on in, spend some quality time with family and this red-headed clown.  And, ah, it's all perception.  They get one letter and they run.  They put their tail between their legs, their Satan tail between their legs and run away.  Pussies turned into a whole nation of pussy rags.  It comes out in everything.  The goddamn Middle East policy, you see that?  We're pussies there too. 
[00:27:00]  Crap will get off the pot, it's called.  Make a decision, stick with it, where we're being so wishy-washy between both sides.  Pick a side, stick with it.  Everything sucks.  Everything sucks.  No one could have any balls.  Everyone's so afraid of pissing someone else off.  Everyone wants to be Mr. Popularity.  You could really make a stand and go here, but it'll piss this side off,  so we've got to be wishy-washy over here. 
[00:27:30]  Have some balls.  No one has balls anymore.  What happened to balls?  Where are the balls?  I got some hangers.  You got some?  I got them.  The big, beefy, hanging, swinging nuts?  I got a couple.  Come on.  Look who's writing all the shows and who's running all the shows in Hollywood,  and that's your answer.  That's why they're re-releasing E.T.  Instead of just writing a new, good, quality movie,  they've got to re-release movies.  And PC it up a little bit at the same time.  PC it all up, because you'll piss someone off. 
[00:28:00]  That really bothers me.  Well, Drew Barrymore should be stabbed anyway for complaining about the gun.  Shut your face, stupid.  Yeah.  Please.  Tooken of flesh guns to the mouth.  Growing up with that dysfunctional friggin' family she had.  Boozing at six.  I know it's hot and all, but Jesus.  And they are, in fairness, a lot cheaper to get them drunk at that age.  Oh, my God.  Another station's going to drop the show.  Don't say that.  Oh, my God.  The advertisers don't like that type of talk. 
[00:28:30]  Just have some balls.  Please.  Talk about revolution of balls in this country.  Take them back.  The station you're listening to Opie and Anthony on has the balls to have this program on.  Everyone's being castrated.  For now.  Yeah.  A couple other people don't have the balls, and they'll be dropping out soon, too.  This nation is being castrated by little friggin' interest groups.  Yep.  Little ones that don't mean crap.  The 99%, the 99.9% of the people that enjoy something aren't writing letters to say how much they enjoy it. 
[00:29:00]  They sit there, mind their own effing business, and enjoy it.  The 0.1% that rattles off a letter because they're too hung up because they were touched as a kid,  or they have a problem with certain things, they're the ones firing off letters.  And for some reason, people feel compelled to listen to them.  To chop their own ball sack off, throw it on a counter, and say,  all right, well, listen.  Yuck.  You disgust me, you nutless wonders. 
[00:29:30]  Have some nuts.  Have a backbone.  Do something.  Caving in left and right.  We're doomed as a nation.  We are so effing doomed.  If this was back in the WW2 days,  do you think we ever would have dropped the bomb with the mentality that's going on right now?  Oh, hell no.  Do you absolutely ever think we'd make a decisive decision to end a goddamn conflict by dropping a bomb or two?  Hell no.  It would be sit there and be debated, debated, debated,  as more soldiers go into meat grinders. 
[00:30:00]  No one's decisive anymore.  They're too afraid of pissing people off.  Make a god-effing decision and stick with it.  Don't be wishy-washy.  It's all the Bob Cutts soccer moms and that whole mentality about how they count two.  You don't count.  Everyone matters and counts and we have to be tolerant to this, that.  You know something?  I don't got to be tolerant to anything I don't want to be tolerant to.  And if I make a decision that looks bad, F you.  I'm sticking with it. 
[00:30:30]  I made it for a reason, you know?  People are so quick to just turn their backs on whatever ideology they had,  whatever principles they had,  and just rip your own sack off and hand it to whatever group demands it.  You disgust me.  So it comes down that two advertisers dropped out of the show and that was good enough for them?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  And it's all the group.  It's not just like, I say it's just liberals.  I love to trash liberals.  But it's the religious people and all those worms, too.  You know, I don't have a problem with someone making a decision 
[00:31:00]  that they don't want to carry the Opie and Anthony program in Austin, Texas.  That's fine.  But then why invite us to the station in the first place, Opie?  Don't have us on for a couple of weeks and then decide,  oh, this isn't right because a couple of advertisers are a little frightened by the program.  Well, you know what you're supposed to do?  Turn around and say, we made the decision to go with this program and we're going to stick with it. 
[00:31:30]  Call up the sex potion companies.  Right, the F potions will climb right on board.  And stick to your goddamn decision.  We've got plenty of people that want to advertise on the O&A show.  Just give us a call.  We can make your junk longer and harder.  Right.  And last longer.  Make you last longer.  We'll make the goddamn juice taste better.  That's right.  Tastes like a hard crisp apple.  There, I said it.  Hallelujah, Anthony. 
[00:32:00]  Hey, we got products to make your wives thinner.  Right.  Makes them tighter.  Makes you bigger.  Who wants a wife with a bunch?  We got the product that gets rid of it.  It'll take it off.  Stack or two.  And when that's gone, you're going to want to F all night long.  Don't listen.  And if she's really fat, we got enough beer to make her look thin.  Right.  Sam at them.  Drink up and you won't care what a slob you're married to. 
[00:32:30]  That's what the show's about.  Those are the advertisers with balls.  We got beds for your threesomes.  Right.  Rockaway bedding.  1,800.  Try a bed.  How many girls you want to bring into your bed?  Rockaway bedding can accommodate you.  Hallelujah.  And the Vermont teddy bear, I apologize for putting it in while you were asleep, bear.  Right.  That's what we're talking about.  Ultra violent games from Rockstar Video Games. 
[00:33:00]  You want to drive down a highway and plow over 20 people, rail an old lady over the hill with a bat and take our money?  We got the game for you.  Advertised on the Opie and Anthony show.  There are plenty of people that embrace this filth.  Booby bars out the egg.  Right.  Right here in New York, the VIP club.  You want sushi?  And then you want to see a hot gay? 
[00:33:30]  And after we get your wife thinner, you're going to want to see her.  Yes.  Go to Dr. Philitoff.  Exactly.  For the eye procedure.  God damn it, I see 2015.  And I love it.  And then you might want to fill up with food at Paisano of Mulberry Street.  With our buddy Joey Paisano down there in Little Italy.  There are plenty of people that embrace this.  So what?  We don't get JCPenney. 
[00:34:00]  Who cares?  Let himself clothing sewn together by legless leopard gimps.  That ain't what we're about on the Opie and Anthony show.  We're about filth, disgust, and debauchery.  And there are people that are willing to embrace that.  And speaking of the advertisers, if you don't like this show, then turn it off and enjoy some satellite radio.  Well, they're allowed to curse. 
[00:34:30]  Right.  It is plauder for me to be on this program with our lovely advertisers.  Plauder for me.  Okay.  Where's the art, Opie?  Where are the luscious, luscious breasts?  And there are worms in all the stations, too, because you get offended someone about wearing some type of a towel on their skull and there had to be a PSA guy.  There's a PSA about it because everyone's got to cater to another group. 
[00:35:00]  You've got to help this out.  Make a decision.  Stick with it.  That's all we're trying to say.  If you think about it, really.  Let me wipe this tear away.  I hope we got all our advertisers in that little bit.  Because now they'll be playing it for all their clients.  Listen, here's our part.  All right.  Well, we've got to get to the spleen audio. 
[00:35:30]  Yes.  We need some time to kind of digest that.  So why don't we take another break?  All righty.  We could play a Wesley Willis song.  Oh, yeah.  Before we go to break, we've got a couple more minutes to kill.  I had Rock and Roll McDonald stuck in my head.  Oh, he's the greatest.  For so long.  And I've heard about five other of his songs.  And they all have the same format.  McDonald's should be happy.  We're giving them free commercials here.  Right.  With Wesley Willis.  Mm-hmm.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's. 
[00:36:00]  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  Got a little English accent in him, I think.  Yeah, it's time for that punk feel.  Our new pal, Wesley Willis.  Yes.  All right.  You want to hear a new one from Wesley Willis?  What do you got? 
[00:36:30]  I think this one's called Cut Off Your Mullet.  Cut Off Your Mullet from Wesley Willis.  There you go.  It's going to sound a lot like all the other Wesley Willis songs we've played in the last week and a half.  With different lyrics, Anthony.  Check this out really fast.  It's a quickie.  Do something about your long, filthy hair.  It looks like a rat's nest.  Do something about your mullet.  Get out the hair, clippers jerk.  Cut the mullet. 
[00:37:00]  Cut the mullet.  Cut the mullet.  Cut the mullet.  Get the rat's nest off your head.  Get that crazy-ass mullet off your skull.  Take your ass to the barbershop.  Tell the barbershop that you're sick of looking like an asshole.  Fuck and roll McDonald's.  Cut the mullet.  Cut the mullet. 
[00:37:30]  Cut the mullet.  Cut the mullet.  Cut the mullet.  That's great.  The mullet is the reason why people hate you.  They are sick of looking at your neppy wheat sack.  Nobody wants to look at you with that mullet on your head.  Why don't you cut that mullet, you numbscore? 
[00:38:00]  Cut the mullet.  Cut the mullet.  Cut the mullet.  Cut the mullet.  We're going like that.  We're going Chicago.  Then show what?  It's Ben Show and Superstore.  You got a new little effects machine.  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  There you go.  Wesley Willis. 
[00:38:30]  Great stuff.  That's today's Wesley Willis song.  Yeah.  Tomorrow we play O.J. Simpson.  Oh, he's got an O.J. song?  He's got an O.J. song.  All right.  We just might make you wait till tomorrow.  Oh.  Ha-ha-ha-ha.  He's a conceptual genius.  I love Wesley Willis.  I love him.  Anthony, tomorrow is a big day for the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah.  We're going to see if you guys can outdo Boston.  Yeah.  Here's your chance.  I don't think you can.  We got another trip to see MTV Icon with Aerosmith in L.A.  When we went to Boston Friday, we asked all our listeners to bring down the wildest, the 
[00:39:00]  strangest, the most unusual thing down at the station.  We saw some crazy sights on Friday.  The winner was a guy who brought his own spleen in a bucket.  Yeah.  His own spleen.  He had a snowboarding accident.  His spleen was removed.  And he made some deal before the surgery.  Like, he wouldn't sign the releases unless they gave him his spleen.  Right.  So, he took it to the show on Friday.  And he showed us.  And it was his spleen.  And the most disgusting part of it, later on in the show, somebody ate a piece of his spleen. 
[00:39:30]  A nice piece, too.  Oh, spleen.  Popped it in his mouth.  A nice piece.  We were going to...  You know, he popped the whole piece in his mouth.  Oh, yeah.  We were just saying, like, eat a little piece of it.  Yeah.  Like, a little...  Oh, no.  He gobbled it down.  And I hear the guy's sick now.  Yeah.  Now, are we going to talk to him a little later?  Yeah.  Rick told me he's sick and he's had some problems with relationships because of this.  Kind of like Austin.  He was dropped right by his girlfriend because he decided cannibalism would be a fun thing on a Friday afternoon. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, cannibalism.  So, we'll talk to him.  But the guy who brought the spleen in, he won the trip to L.A. for the Aerosmith thing.  We're doing the same thing tomorrow.  So, we're seeing what New York could offer us.  Right.  And the wildest, strangest, most unusual thing will win the trip to L.A.  All right?  Amaze us, people.  And a little booby prize.  You beat spleen guy, we'll throw in something extra.  Yeah.  All right?  So, that's that.  So, oh, when we get back, we'll play the audio of the guy eating the spleen.  Yes.  And Anthony just loses his mind. 
[00:40:30]  I have a real problem with stuff like this that no one in my company seems to understand.  No.  Like, I have a severe phobia of human organs.  You can explain that.  Except the fact.  During the audio, you're freaking out like crazy.  Yeah.  You're losing it.  I know.  Like, you didn't want it to go down.  No.  I'm like, dude, come on.  We have to do this for our show.  Cannibalism.  No.  Come on.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No. 
[00:41:00]  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey.  I want to thank Philly for having the balls to have Opie and Anthony in their city.  Oh, Lord.  I want to thank WISP. 
[00:41:30]  Why do you think Tim Savion wears such tight slacks, Anthony?  To show those balls he's got.  To show those big, huge antelopes.  Right.  He has balls.  He understands what this show's about.  He supports it.  Uh-huh.  He knows how to get advertisers.  Right.  I want to thank WBCN for having the balls to have Opie and Anthony on the air.  Yeah. 
[00:42:00]  And if his sack is so huge, he has to keep it in the secret room, Anthony.  In the secret room.  He only breaks it out on special occasions.  The secret room.  He's not worried about advertisers.  They know people who will advertise with this show.  They don't cater to the special interest groups.  Right.  A couple of dopey letter writers.  Disgusts me.  What are you, crazy? 
[00:42:30]  With your language.  Well, they are.  Thank God we have the technology to dump out of that.  Lewis Black in the studio.  Lewis.  He only has...  Well, go ahead, Lewis.  Who were you yelling about?  Austin?  Yeah, Austin decided out of nowhere to just drop the show without telling anybody.  After...  How long were we on there?  Five weeks.  Five weeks.  How can Austin drop?  What is this, a TV sitcom?  Yeah, really?  That's all they give us.  How can Austin?  Austin.  They decided to go more conservative.  Right wing babble. 
[00:43:00]  Right wing talk.  They went right wing talk.  And if you go to their website, it says, the station proclaims to be a station with balls.  Right.  Yeah.  Two advertisers complain.  They're like, oh, that's it.  Got to get rid of the ONA show.  And Austin, I loved Austin because I played Austin and I'm playing it again.  And the first time I played it, you know, you go to Austin, you hear nothing.  This is a hip city.  Yeah.  This is a great city.  Music, all this stuff.  Oh, sure.  Every night, I had to stop the show and go into the audience and sit down and say that 
[00:43:30]  I was appalled that they didn't understand a joke.  Really?  I'd say, can you suppose to be...  Hey, the Jew boy's coming out in the crowd again.  Come on, Jew boy.  New York, gee.  Hey, gee.  They were unbelievable.  But then you've got to remember Austin is the hippest city in Texas.  Yeah, you know.  So...  Eh, you know.  It's Austin.  It's Austin. 
[00:44:00]  What are you going to get out of Austin?  I just wish they had the balls to tell us.  That's all.  That's all.  They didn't have the balls to tell two advertisers to, all right, go shove.  Yeah, go F yourself.  Yeah, especially since you did that celebration of Texas Week.  Go shove.  That's what I said, Norton.  What's the hullabaloo about?  You hear me?  We should move on, though.  We've got to tell Lewis what happened on Friday's show.  Yeah.  And then we want to play the audio.  We have this contest.  We're doing it tomorrow here in New York for a trip to see Aerosmith at MTV Icon in L.A. 
[00:44:30]  We're looking for the most unusual, the craziest, the strangest thing you can bring down to the station while we broadcast it.  Sort of a maze, Opie and Anthony kind of a thing.  You come down, you bring something, you walk in the studio with it, and we're like, oh, my God, I can't believe you either brought that down or how did you get that?  Kind of weird thing.  I was amazed.  Anthony was horrified.  I was completely horrified.  I cannot take things involving bodily fluids or any kind of body parts, guts, things like that. 
[00:45:00]  Well, you left the studio, didn't you, when you had that thing where they were eating that stuff?  Yeah, yeah, well...  Eating what?  It's not as bad...  Remember they had that thing, you know, you had all of the...  The smell was horrid.  The smell was horrific.  It's not bad with, like, when they bring the pig organs or the lamb brains, stuff like that.  That doesn't get me.  It's the human stuff.  Like when the girl was squirting for distance, you know what I mean?  You know, she grabs a handful of chest and there it goes. 
[00:45:30]  It goes across the room.  Well, I was so far behind and to the side of her because I knew it was going to happen and it happened to Stinky.  Stinky's standing right next to her.  That thing goes off like a sprinkler, yeah.  A shot out the side.  Stinky got it right in the face.  Who did?  Stinky.  Who?  Awesome, Garrett.  Awesome, Garrett, you ass.  And I did not need that type of milk on me.  Ugh. 
[00:46:00]  It skeeves me out.  So that when the guy brought his spleen, and just to look at it was bad enough.  Oh, and it was his spleen.  In a bucket.  In a bucket with formaldehyde.  And he kept his spleen.  Yeah.  He was so adamant with the...  The guy was a little weird.  He had a snowboarding accident.  Yeah.  And he told the people at the hospital, he goes, look, I'm not signing any release unless  you allow me to bring my spleen home.  I'm bringing all my body parts home with me.  Now, did he know that there'd be a contest? 
[00:46:30]  Was he not going to show?  No, lucky him.  See what happens when you think?  Lucky him.  Hopey and Anthony came to town.  Yeah, really.  There was something to do with it.  The P.T.  Barnum of the year.  Right.  Hurry, hurry, hurry.  We felt like P.T.  Barnum because people were coming by with all sorts of crap and we had to say yes or no.  Like, ah, not weird enough.  Not good enough.  Sorry you only have, you know, one arm and one leg.  Not weird enough.  The guy with the skull.  That's your mother?  Right.  Yeah.  The guy with the skull was a little freaky, too. 
[00:47:00]  He had his friend.  They were out in Utah walking around and his friend almost tripped over something, kicked  it.  He looks down and it's a human skull.  So they take it to a buddy of theirs who, you know, he just, he doesn't need anything  like carbon dating or forensics or anything.  He assumed it was a couple hundred year old Indian skull.  With a bullet hole in the back.  I'm like, don't you want to, and I said, I go, don't you think you should have maybe  turned this over to the authorities so they could, Lewis.  Oh, man.  And we were talking after the show. 
[00:47:30]  The skull seemed a little too new.  It looked a little new to be like something ancient.  We've all been to museums and, you know, skulls that are a couple hundred years old, they're  pretty bleached out and this.  That's been in the Utah desert.  Exactly.  I don't know how old bones have to be before they're relics or murder evidence.  You know what I mean?  It's like, okay, what, 50 years?  This one had on a Red Sox hat.  So that was a little weird. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, man.  But the spleen thing, when it came down that this guy, Mike, was going to eat.  In a bucket?  Not even in like a jar?  No, it was in a bucket.  Bucket with the hazard waste sticker.  Yeah.  And then he had a bag.  It was a plastic bag in the bucket and then it was wrapped in some kind of paper that was  all soaking in formaldehyde.  It was definitely his spleen.  Yeah, it was his spleen.  So then we decided to cut off a piece.  Get a good one.  Whose idea was that? 
[00:48:30]  Which genius?  So I know where, you know.  I believe it's the Opie genius.  Anything that even resembles something like this, you could always default that it's going  to be Opie.  Okay.  Because I cannot come up with this.  I thought it was a good idea.  Canis.  I hope no one's microwaving their food today in Boston.  Yeah, imagine that.  You pop your sandwich in the microwave.  Because the spleen exploded in the microwave.  Who knew spleens weren't microwavable?  It just went.  Look at Lewis's face. 
[00:49:00]  It did not.  It turned into a dried out brown, big hunk of goo.  So then Rick brings it in.  We only had like two minutes to do this on Friday, so that's why we're going over this.  So Rick brings it in on a little paper plate.  And the paper plate, if you've ever heated up any beef on a paper plate in the microwave,  the juice will run out of it and soak red into the plate.  That's what it looked like.  The smell coming off of it was like cooking meat, but just the thought you knew it was  a spleen made it disgusting and nauseating to breathe in. 
[00:49:30]  I mean, it's a human spleen.  And it's a human spleen.  Otherwise, it's sweetbreads, I think, or something.  I think brains are sweetbreads, something like that.  There's the picture on the website.  Ask Frenchy.  He'll know.  What website are they?  OpianAnthony.com.  This picture's from our Boston trip.  But there's a spleen on a paper plate.  So then a guy decides, and he didn't even get anything that great.  Chachi got, what did he get, Incubus tickets?  Yeah.  That's it?  I mean, that's a cool show to go see, but to eat a spleen to get them, huh? 
[00:50:00]  Oh, man.  Wow.  So he eats the spleen, and he gets the tickets.  He gets the...  I think we have video of it on FoundryMusic.com, matter of fact.  You got a guy...  So the guy who ate the spleen got the tickets.  The other guy's still, I guess, in the running.  No, the guy that ate the spleen...  By the way, he got tickets.  The guy with the spleen went to, um...  He gets to go to L.A.  L.A.  Here's the...  Here's the nuked piece of spleen.  Oh, man.  And if you look at it, see what I mean about the red juices? 
[00:50:30]  It was actually brown.  Yeah.  Was that a friend?  Who ate the spleen?  Just some guy.  What do you mean, some guy?  You had somebody in the studio just, you know, leaked that?  Yeah.  This guy ate it.  Mike.  Yeah.  What's up, Mike?  What's going on?  I hear you're sick, and you lost your girlfriend.  Yeah.  All for the show.  It was all worth it, too.  Okay.  You're going to have to explain that.  Wait a minute.  Are you being sarcastic, sir?  No.  I'm completely honest.  Yeah?  That was what frightened me. 
[00:51:00]  What type of illness are you feeling?  Well, I'm just, you know, nauseous, puking.  You're throwing up?  Yeah.  I haven't eaten in a couple days.  Well, there's a lesson.  There's a lesson for you kids out there.  If you want a diet.  If you're thinking of cannibalism, you know, it doesn't work unless it's a cultural thing.  Right.  You know?  Unless.  Hey, Mike.  Yeah.  Have you been burping and tasting human spleen?  Oh.  No, there's not really any aftertaste, which I was surprised at. 
[00:51:30]  No?  And when you're getting sick, do you think it's from the spleen meat or maybe the residual  formaldehyde that didn't evaporate fully during any microwaving process?  I'm saying that it's probably the preservative.  Yeah.  Formaldehyde is not a good thing to ingest.  Oh, really?  Yeah, but we nuked it.  We can nuking it safe.  They said nuking a male for the anthrax.  We really need an expert for this radio show.  I don't know.  We need a chemist.  What?  And a microbiologist.  We need all kinds of people. 
[00:52:00]  What could happen to you if you drink formaldehyde?  You could die.  You could die.  Chloroform.  You could die.  Yeah, you could die for me.  So, Mike, did you go to a doctor or anything?  No.  No.  I just drowned it with some beer.  All right.  That's good.  See, you survived there, Lord.  You survived.  Did you...  You don't know what the guy's got.  Exactly.  You know?  I mean, that's internal stuff.  You would think any disease that was in the spleen for such a...  How long did he say it had been in the bucket? 
[00:52:30]  I don't know.  A couple of weeks?  Yeah, a couple of weeks.  You just had it removed.  Yeah.  You would think any real diseases.  They can't live that long.  I'm talking to you.  This is like...  You know, this is what?  I'm speculating.  The male women?  I'm speculating, Lewis.  I'm speculating.  Hey, man.  In my opinion, I wouldn't think the disease is collapsed that long.  Hey, man.  Dr. Anthony.  Hey, man.  We're radio guys, not doctors.  I don't know.  What do we know?  Unbelievable.  I play one on the radio.  Right.  I mean, why not?  What? 
[00:53:00]  Have you ever heard of anyone getting AIDS from eating another man's spleen?  Who eats another man's spleen?  It's not like something happens.  Don't answer with questions.  I'm saying, I don't think there's one documented case of AIDS spread by a man eating another  man's spleen.  Maybe other organs.  Yeah, if he eats it right after he tongues the balloon up, maybe.  Eats it while it's still in.  Hey, Lenny.  Lenny was up there.  Oh, you're the guy with the thumb.  Yeah.  This guy could take his thumb and twist it all. 
[00:53:30]  No, I think it was toe.  He had the toe.  Oh, you're a toe thumb guy.  He had big toes for thumbs.  I was outside when he was outside the studio.  Yeah.  He was pounding bears and he was saying I was going to eat it.  And I knew he was going to.  He was a maniac.  And he looked like George Animal Steel.  He was going after it.  You know what the most amazing part of the whole thing was for me?  When you watch a movie or read a book about people driven to cannibalism to survive, 
[00:54:00]  the moral decision that they have to make is they toil over it to the point where they  will only eat the meat of another human if they are surely dead if they don't.  They sit there and wait until they're wasted away and they go,  all right, look, we're going to have to do this.  This guy's like, tickets?  Flock?  Human meat right in mouth?  Swallowed down it with a beer.  There's no thinking about it.  You know, the Donner Party, none of that. 
[00:54:30]  Alive, the soccer team that crashed in the Andes.  Well, you know, sure, we kick it around like a soccer ball and take a bite out of it.  It's fun eating human.  The Donner Party, you mean they ate each other up?  Lewis, why are you so shocked?  Why am I shocked?  This is the second time we've done something like this on our show.  Well, the first time we had a girl, was it for Aerosmith again?  Yeah.  Or was it?  It was Aerosmith.  Or was that the kiss thing?  It was Aerosmith. 
[00:55:00]  Aerosmith again.  A girl wanted to go to Aerosmith so bad.  We have a friend of the show, Stockbroker Dave.  We broadcasted his vasectomy live on our show.  Had a vasectomy.  And Rick was in Jersey for the procedure and decided to bring home a piece.  Brought home a piece of the tube.  Oh, man.  And somebody ate on a Ritz cracker.  Put it on a cracker and ate it.  It was a woman who came in here trailing about three kids.  She didn't have children.  Yeah, she had kids with her.  Come on, mom. 
[00:55:30]  Come on, babies.  Come on, babies.  I got to Aerosmith.  Oh, yeah.  No problem.  Ate a cracker with his vasertube on it.  Just sitting there.  Yeah, yeah.  Uh-huh.  You just, you know, why am I shocked?  You just hope that there's a point where you can stop.  Doctors and nurses are calling in like crazy now.  Perfect.  Melody, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Hi.  I am a dialysis nurse, and I just wanted to let you know, when we take the kidneys, which  is the artificial kidney, the dialysis, we process it with formaldehyde to sterilize 
[00:56:00]  it.  Yeah.  And if you don't get the formaldehyde out before you put the patient back on, they could  have such side effects such as death.  Oh, that's a bad side effect.  By you microwaving, it doesn't take out, you know, the formaldehyde.  It's just marinated in it.  So this poor guy, that's such a nasty side effect from formaldehyde.  But when you take the human spleen, make sure to marinate it in formaldehyde.  It's a wonderful flavor with some pecorino remoto cheese. 
[00:56:30]  Uh, Melody?  Yeah?  No, he's, uh, it was three days ago.  He's okay, right?  No, he's fine, but that's probably why he's feeling so sick.  Well, you know something?  Steve, on line three, has the warning label on a bottle of formaldehyde.  Let's go to Steve.  Steve, what's up?  Yeah.  Okay, on, first of all, it says danger, poison.  Yeah, well.  Okay.  In case of contact, immediately flush, uh, flush eyes and skin.  If swallowed, drink several glasses of water.  Um, do not get an eyes, skin, or anything else. 
[00:57:00]  It also says, causes irritation to mucous membranes.  Yeah, and don't drive heavy equipment.  Yeah.  Well, he washed it down with a bunch of beer.  Well, you know, preservatives are preservatives, you know?  All right, good.  He's fine.  I think the microwave, Mike, it nuked out all the bad stuff that's in formaldehydes.  I love that Opie's sensitivity is death.  You know, as soon as we get toward death, then there's a moment of, like, lucidity comes over.  Well, hell, I gotta eat. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, he's fine.  Lewis thought you took one for the team, getting arrested for 28 hours.  Yeah, but that was...  This guy risked his life for the O&A show.  Well, then, he's...  Here's a family doctor.  Let's see what's going on here.  Mark, what's going on?  What are you doing, guys?  Hey.  Listening to this.  I'm a family physician out of, uh, New Jersey.  I'm not going on.  And, uh, what this guy's experiencing, uh, can actually be fatal.  It's, uh, formatoid can be known to eat through your stomach lining.  And, uh, it could be infecting somewhere through his, uh, kidney area or whatnot. 
[00:58:00]  Let's see if, uh, Mike's okay.  Hey, hey, Mike.  Mike.  Breathe.  What's up?  Nothing.  Are you getting freaked out?  No.  Yeah, I don't care.  I drank some beers.  I'm fine.  Well, actually, alcohol can intensify the effects, so that's why he's feeling sick right now.  It's been three days, though, Mark.  The only moral decision I had was I wish you had some fiber beans and a nice Chianti.  I think he needs to be a kind of psychotic, though.  He's a sick...  Too bad he wasn't a census taker.  All right, Mike. 
[00:58:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bye.  Here's, um, some special hazards.  For the eye and skin, irritation.  Inhalation, uh, you get nose, throat, respiratory irritation.  Ingestion, harmful.  Target organs, skin, throat, nose, eye, skin, respiratory tract.  Carcinogen.  Formaldehyde carcinogen is the nickel and chromium that are in there, which I don't believe are boiled away with, uh,  with, uh, microwaving.  Nickel and chromium.  But how much was actually in there? 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, we just irradiated the nickel and chromium that was already in it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, man.  Oh, well.  Well.  Ah, good, clean fun.  Yeah.  It's three days.  It's three days.  First aid.  Something would have happened by now.  Contact physician immediately.  Uh, eye and skin, flush with plenty of water for 15 minutes.  Obtain medical attention in all cases.  Wow. 
[00:59:30]  All right.  That could, uh...  Well, you want to hear the audio?  Sounds tricky.  Yeah, this would be fun.  It's quick.  Listen to Anthony.  He's losing it.  Because, like I said, this stuff skeeves me out.  I don't like...  I like when human beings are in their own package.  Nothing leaking from it.  Nothing coming out.  Just stay in your own package.  Let me tell you, it's one of the few signs of sanity I've seen in you.  Thank you.  It's the fact that any normal person watching another human being pop another human being's 
[01:00:00]  spleen in his mouth, and it doesn't make you somewhat sick.  Right.  You have to seek some sort of help.  Thank you.  I was just like, wow, that's cool.  No.  There we go.  Sick.  There we go.  Not cool.  That was cool.  Sick.  There we go, and there he is.  We've got...  Now that he's back from death, boom, there it is, Mr. Sensitivity.  Tyler from Stanford goes, yeah, death, walk it off, dick.  Exactly.  All right, here's the clip.  Rick said that there's not much of you in here because we had to get right to the point  that...  That's fine.  All right.  I was freaking out.  All right, here we go.  Where's the guy that wanted to eat the spleen? 
[01:00:30]  Look how the juices ran out of it and soaked the plate.  You're pointing at the guy that could rotate his thumb completely around.  Me, me, me.  All right, this is the showstopper.  I've had it.  All right, what's your name?  What's your name?  I got the mic.  All right, Mike, where are you from?  Wayman.  All right, Chachi from WBCN is going to give you some fine prizes if you can get that down.  If I...  I just have to eat it?  This is cannibalism on the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, my God.  It is true cannibalism.  Yeah, it's a...  Set go?  Set go on.  It's a big piece of spleen. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, my God.  He just ate a spleen.  Just ate a piece of spleen.  He just ate human spleen.  He ate human spleen.  Oh.  One man eating another man.  Ah, why not?  Eating another man's organ.  What's wrong, Lewis?  It's wrong.  That is wrong.  It is wrong.  It's wrong.  And it's wrong for applause.  But it's Friday, so it's understandable.  You go through a week.  It's brutal.  You have 40 hours of work.  You need to take the edge off.  You need someone to pop a little spleen in their mouth. 
[01:01:30]  Exactly.  You always want that.  Go a little crazy.  You know?  Well, tomorrow we see if New York can beat Boston, because we have another trip to L.A.  to see MTV Icon with Aerosmith.  Come down with the most unusual, the strangest, the wildest, the craziest thing that you have.  It could be anything, man.  It could be a person.  It could be something that you have in your house.  Whatever.  If you go in for surgery today just to win tickets for Aerosmith, I want you to stop now.  Okay?  Stop it.  I know some of you out there are going, oh, you know what I think I'm going to do? 
[01:02:00]  I'll just have them take out part of my liver.  Stop it!  Don't even do it!  Don't even think about it!  So the craziest thing that shows up tomorrow will win the trip to L.A.  Right.  And a little booby prize if someone could beat Spleen Guy.  I doubt it.  I mean, let's be honest with each other here.  I doubt it.  But if you beat Spleen Guy, we'll throw in an extra prize as well, okay?  Right.  Lewis Block, we'll give you a duck's ass.  We'll see what's going on with Lewis.  We only have him for a few more minutes because then he's doing something on CNN Live.  CNN! 
[01:02:30]  Not Live.  Headline News.  Headline News.  Yeah.  You're going on there live, though, right?  Yeah.  And you're going to be...  So we can punch up Headline News here?  And I will be on at 510.  And watch it?  Because that's where my career is at.  The people who do CNN and then do CNN Headlines.  Are you on with that Bobby Batista chick?  No.  Yeah?  You don't know which I to look into with her.  I know, you don't.  Right?  One's going one way, one's going the other.  You're like, whoo, Bobby.  Which one?  Yeah.  And I did this show about when I was down in Atlanta. 
[01:03:00]  Have you ever been in that gym?  Never did it.  It's like a compound.  Really?  The CNN compound.  It is.  It's a CNN compound and mall.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And hotel.  CNN wear and goods.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Of course.  Very nice.  So why don't we take a break and we'll talk about that.  Also, Lewis has a special coming on Comedy Central.  We'll talk about that.  Oh, and I'm going to be in...  Oh, yeah.  We'll talk about that, too.  In Jerusalem.  Westbury.  The West Bank, what?  Where are you going?  Oh, Westbury.  A little different.  And also, we've got a surprise for you, Lewis. 
[01:03:30]  You're going to get your psychic reading on the show today.  Oh, by...  From Ricky the Pervert.  Ricky from Boston.  I'm going to be in...  The West Bank.  Wild.  Or disgusting.  The West Bank.  To Opian Anthony.  Bring the weirdest crap imaginable to Opian Anthony tomorrow.  You can win a trip to L.A. to see MTV Icon with Aerosmith.  The Opian Anthony Show.  The Opian Anthony Show.  1027.  WNEW. 
[01:04:00]  WNEW.  WNEW.  WNEW.  WNEW.  WNEW.  Corn here to stay.  This is Opie and Anthony Lewis Black in the studio.  He's got lots going on, and he's leaving us in a few minutes here.  He's got to go to CNN.  He's one of the newsmakers and shakers.  CNN headline.  Yeah, really.  Headline news.  Headline news.  People are blowing themselves up around the world.  And let's stop for a moment and talk to Lewis Black.  What are you on there for?  What are they talking about?  I'm on there because there's 96 hours of news a day,  and you're going to have to fill it with somebody. 
[01:04:30]  I'm promoing my, I did a special for Comedy Central about taxes.  About taxes.  Uh-huh.  I don't think I'd pay those taxes anymore.  It's so overrated.  You guys, you know, you guys have like, you've got that, you know, truck full of money.  They just come and collect a little.  They just take it.  You know.  You don't have to file.  They'll just take it.  W and EW is part of their deal.  They just kind of paid off the federal government.  So you're going to be talking about.  It just said keep them out of jail.  So now when we tune in to see you on Headline News, you're going to be talking about the special. 
[01:05:00]  I'm going to be talking about my gay relationship with you.  Really?  You can do that.  I'll watch.  You know.  Well, I just thought it could, you know, it could pull in a few more numbers and we move up the chart.  I thought perhaps they've gotten to the last possible person that could solve the Middle East problem,  Lewis Black.  It's like, all right, well, bring in Lewis because we've run out of experts.  We've run out of politicians.  Well, actually, I think with the passage of Milton Berle, I actually move up the ladder. 
[01:05:30]  You do move up the comic ladder of respect.  Exactly.  So, you know, somebody had to move up and I'm one of them.  Who has to die to put you on top?  Who's the guy ahead of you?  He's about 50.  Paulie Shore.  Is he above?  Paulie Shore.  Of course.  Paulie Shore.  Yeah, no doubt.  In this career, I feel like I'm smelling his butt.  I'm thinking Emo Phillips is right above you.  Emo?  Emo?  Norton is definitely.  Norton's out there looking for airline tickets.  I like getting your take on some things, Lewis. 
[01:06:00]  What do you think of the whole situation over there in the Middle East?  What's the biggest problem?  Is it ever going to be resolved?  You don't ever solve a problem in a desert without gambling.  Las Vegas.  So you think gambling.  Gambling.  Is the answer.  Casinos.  Let the Palestinians build the casinos and let the Jews play at them.  And that's done.  Isn't it?  It's done.  Good food.  Plenty of it.  It's done.  That's it.  Casinos.  Well, it's one thing they haven't tried yet. 
[01:06:30]  Well, it makes sense.  It would stop everything.  They'd go, wait a minute.  Wait a sec.  I could see where Christ was or I could play, you know, Caribbean stud poker.  I think it's a no-brainer.  The Palestinians are making money.  Yeah.  And the Jews are happy because they're in a little gambling place.  You know?  A little resort.  And then you get the, you know, and then when she got that, the Orientals show up eight minutes later.  So, to sit last at the blackjack table and draw when the dealer's showing a 12. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  And they put all their towels in their suitcases and nobody has any headwear.  They do it every time.  I am stereotyping right now, but there's a goddamn reason for it.  Hey, hit me.  Yes.  Hit me.  You stupid son of a bitch.  It never fails.  Everyone's sitting there.  You're sitting there with your goddamn, you know, your 17, whatever it is.  And the dealer is showing a 14. 
[01:07:30]  He's showing a 4, you know, her face card.  He's showing a 5, whatever it is.  The goddamn Asian guy has his, he's got his 16.  Hit me.  Hit me.  No, you stand.  You wait for the, he busts.  What does the dealer pull?  Whatever he needs to make 21.  Yeah.  No, it's exactly that.  You bastard Asians.  Well, no, that and the fact that I have never, I won't, if it's an Asian dealer, I won't play.  Leave.  I leave.  I've gotten killed by then.  Oh, Ruiz Brack. 
[01:08:00]  Sit down, Ruiz.  We have praise some Brack, Drack.  I hate when you've got a hot table.  It's going very well.  And the dealer goes, does that thing.  Oh, you're leaving?  Oh, here comes Fung.  Here comes Fung.  Are you, dear?  Mr. Fung.  Good Ruck.  Good Ruck.  No, no.  Ruck gone now.  Ruck gone.  Ruck run when you come here.  Happens every time. 
[01:08:30]  I'm on a great streak.  You know, I'm splitting stuff.  I'm hitting blackjack on both of them.  Woo.  He comes over.  Oh, you have a trev.  I keep pulling 12s.  12.  Ruck, dear, I'm Brack, Jack.  Ho, ho.  Good Ruck.  Yeah.  And you've got to sit there.  Look at this effing beaut they sent me.  The guy's got a memory like a steel trap.  All right, you want to get a reading, Lewis?  No, I've got to go.  Before you leave?  I can't.  I've got to go.  No, no, no.  It's got to be quick. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, he's got to go.  Yeah, I do.  Very quick.  Ricky.  My clock says 438.  Ricky.  Yes, sir.  All right, quickly.  We're in a big hurry.  Lewis Black has to go to CNN.  We met, real fast.  We met Ricky in Boston now, Lewis.  And he's a psychic on the side when he's not collecting cans and molesting little boys.  I don't collect cans.  I don't molest little boys.  What do you think about him?  Lewis, here's what I'm going to tell you very quickly.  Yeah.  First of all, you started up and you didn't know whether you wanted to go to comedy or news.  And then you started up and you worked out of a low-class nightclub and you started up to the top. 
[01:09:30]  And right now, you're making it halfway there.  And I see the future of you coming up good.  But you have a little financial problem there once in a while, you know, back at home, you know.  And you have to work on that.  But now you have to make a decision whether you want to stay in comedy or whether it's going to be a bomb for you  or whether you want to turn around and become a newscaster.  And I see the newscaster more on your agenda as this time as perhaps the future.  That's a decision that you've been thinking about making and you're not sure about making. 
[01:10:00]  But I'd like to do a decision that will come out.  And I do have a prediction, if you could put me in, if you want to stay on, about the Opie and Anthony show of the future.  Yeah, I get it.  The Opie and Anthony show of the future, for every station that drops Opie and Anthony,  there will be five more news stations that's going to pick it up.  Oh, there you go.  It's because when we take away freedom of speech for people who want alternative stations,  This is making me want to take away freedom of speech.  This guy talking makes me...  Because I'll tell you one thing.  Right.  People have to have the balls to write to the program director to take them off and say, 
[01:10:30]  Hey, we want them back up.  I know pontificating.  And pick it outside the station.  I see the future of Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony show in the future.  We're wearing Mylar suits.  And by the way, Opie...  That's the only change I see with the future.  Mylar suits.  Opie, you've got to stop wearing them bras.  There's no good for you.  All right.  Lewis, I didn't meet that girl that you said I was going to meet.  Here's Ricky.  You're sitting with Lewis.  I mean Ricky.  I'm sorry.  Hey, a girl?  No, she is.  She had the biggest boobies I've ever seen, by the way.  You said I was going to meet a girl Friday night. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, you're going to meet a girl Friday night, but you get too drunk, you're passed up, man.  No.  Actually, psychics don't...  It could be any Friday, because psychics are wrong in terms of time.  How's the reading for you, Lewis?  As a matter of fact, that girl is moat moat.  Yeah, how was your reading?  That reading is...  I began to think, well, am I just supposed to accept this as the facts?  It wasn't close.  Yeah, of course not.  It wasn't close.  This guy is the worst psychic ever.  But it was a good shot.  Yeah.  But I am going to...  But he was right.  I am going to CNN, and they'll probably, when I'm there, will offer me a job in news. 
[01:11:30]  Well, let Lewis go, because I don't want him to be late because of this show.  Right.  No, and then I've got to tell people I'm at Westbury, because they keep screaming,  Tell me you're going to be at Westbury.  Oh, they're going to spin you around on the old Westbury and around the stage?  No, they're only doing it in half.  Lewis Black and Kevin Meany at the Westbury Music Fair on Wednesday.  Oh, well, now...  Bobcat, go away.  I've got to talk to Kevin Meany about his airport thing.  Yeah, I'll find out on Wednesday.  Yeah, please.  I'll tell Kevin to give you guys a yell.  We're going to lose the house.

Get in the coffin, you stupid.  No, no, Frenchy, seriously, Frenchy.  You have a little fear about dying, don't you?  You're meek, right?  You're drunk, aren't you?

Shut up for a second, Frenchy.  Frenchy.  Yeah, go ahead.  Seriously, Frenchy, you have a little fear about flying, number one, and you have a little fear also about your future, 
[01:14:00]  because right now your future is doing good, but you're still not quite clear the way you want to be.  You want to try to progress more.  You got to relax more, Frenchy.  You got to kind of lay back more.  You got to lay back more and stop worrying about what tomorrow is going on.  Ricky, Ricky, something about your readings.  You say this to everybody.  Don't you assume that everyone that's alive wants to be further along in what they're doing than they are at that moment in time? 
[01:14:30]  Like, you don't hope, gee, I hope things go down from here, or, gee, I hope it just stops because I'm fine.  All right, Frenchy, you got a promotion coming up.  Well, so far you're totally wrong, so I just want to tell you that.  And another thing, you smell like a toilet, you bum.  Hey, kiss my anus.  You smell like crap.  Go to the dump.
