<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts defending their controversial, offensive style, jokingly referring to their audience as "drooling mongoloids," and speculating about Sean Hannity's potential departure from their network.  The conversation quickly shifted to Anthony's relationship with Jill Nicolini,  presenting themselves as a "power couple" and comparing themselves to Brangelina, while also making crude jokes about the divorces of Bill Murray and Jim McGreevy, and commenting on Harvey Korman's death.  They then discussed clips from Ultimate Warrior videos, focusing on his feud with Hulk Hogan.  A significant portion featured listener calls about divorce, alimony, and perceived legal biases against men, alongside satirical, offensive commentary on the "Sex and the City" movie.  Upcoming live shows in New Jersey and Boston were promoted, featuring guest appearances by Terrell Owens and Nick DiPaolo.  A producer-created "sing-along mixtape" about Anthony and Jill's relationship, and a playful jab at a local news station, concluded this segment.

The show continued with further "Sex and the City" derision, mocking a street reporter's comment about a woman forcing her husband to watch it, followed by discussions of their own mortality and frustrations with modern entertainment, including insensitive jokes about John McCain's health.  A clip of Regis Philbin farting on live television prompted more laughter and crude commentary.  Details of Opie's new relationship with Jill Nicolini were shared, including anecdotes about their dates and a "couple song."  Discussion of Clay Aiken's fatherhood, a bizarre celebrity news story, a woman ejected from a Mariners game for kissing another woman, and a Manhattan crane collapse followed.  Nick DiPaolo, promoting his stand-up act, and Terrell Owens, discussing his Alzheimer's Association involvement and career, were in studio as guests.  This segment concluded with more discussions of Owens' career and miscellaneous news items, including celebrity deaths, alongside listener calls.

Terrell Owens detailed his contentious departure from the Philadelphia Eagles, attributing the negativity to misreported contract negotiations and negative media portrayals.  He described the Philadelphia fan base and Vet Stadium in highly negative terms, and revealed he skipped the Super Bowl to enjoy a date and see "The Bucket List."  A lengthy, humorous, and crude segment followed featuring a highly ticklish guest, Roland, whose reactions to being tickled became a recurring comedic element.  Roland also recommended "Foot Fist Way," prompting a discussion of the movie and its trailer.  Roland's profuse sweating due to the studio's heat added to the comedic effect. Jokes about the Eagles, other athletes, and the hosts' personalities continued throughout. A listener called in about a fake Regis Philbin farting video.

A lengthy, sexually explicit interaction with a female listener, "Patty," followed, involving attempts to persuade her to allow a host to lick her nipple.  This exchange was filled with vulgar language and sexually suggestive comments.  The conversation moved to Patty's dating life and partner preferences, but ended abruptly.

A significant portion of the show focused on "Stalker Patty," engaging in explicit conversations with the hosts and Roland.  Patty's fantastical descriptions of her nonexistent romantic partner escalated to graphic sexual scenarios. The hosts encouraged increasingly outrageous statements and actions from Patty, culminating in challenges such as squeezing a host's penis through his jeans, and using a strap-on dildo on a fake vagina.  Nick DiPaolo was a guest during this segment.  Patty's impromptu striptease for the studio audience, interspersed with more explicit talk and jokes, followed.  The hosts solicited donations for Patty, who revealed significant debt.

The final segment involved Patty performing increasingly explicit dances for money from the audience, with the hosts providing sexually suggestive commentary and urging her to reveal more of her body.  The hosts referred to the performance as a "money shot" and joked about her sexual availability.  They then showed Patty "Two Girls, One Cup," attempting to bribe her to perform a similar act, which she refused.  The discussion then shifted to the Ron and Fez show, culminating in a bizarre scenario where Patty had to choose which show would be destroyed by a collapsing crane.  Patty initially chose Ron and Fez, leading to ribbing from Opie and Anthony.  The segment ended with more sexually explicit comments from Patty.

[00:08:30]  murray was in stripes and a bit of a jam looks like bill murray's a bad boy well who knows his wife is  bringing this up and he's going through a divorce who knows what's true his wife looks like katie  holmes with down syndrome that sounds attractive she does front page of the paper bill murray's sex  and drug scandal and of course they have to write the first line this way actor bill murray's wife is 
[00:09:00]  making sure nothing gets lost in translation oh i get it she's claiming that uh what he was addicted  to booze and drugs and going overseas for broads overseas yeah he would just leave the hell he would  just leave uh you know for a few days at a time and he would go overseas looking for uh looking for  some action good boy so uh he's getting a divorce from his wife thailand 10 or 11 years he's going 
[00:09:30]  i am southeast asia uh-oh i'm thinking hong kong allegations hong kong  and then uh the daily news slimed the headline is slimed and it says ghostbusters star ghostbusters  wow what year is this bill murray's waking up uh insulted today i think he did um you know one  two movies after ghostbusters perhaps more than that  yeah so uh that's breaking today too bill murray but i think anthony's right when when you're going 
[00:10:00]  through a divorce yeah you know it's an all-out war you're gonna make all kinds of things right  like mcgreevy and uh his wife all that that's going on that was getting me this morning listening uh  to the news like mcgreevy's wife wants to live the life she's been accustomed to  well yeah that's great a husband that bites a pillow what do you need turning over to ask questions 
[00:10:30]  and just seeing his head print in the pillow but it's empty and you just know he's going for another  drive jim loves to drive at night finding a park and ride loves to drive and then he won't talk face  to face when he comes home without lavoris but she's um her lawyer is uh they're making her out as this  poor woman who will never again live the life that she's been accustomed to and you know something 
[00:11:00]  uh where's the guarantee where's this all mighty guarantee that that is what is supposed to happen  in life with anything hell i'd like to know that uh i i would be able to live the life i've become  accustomed to for the rest of my life there's just no guarantees you never know what's going to happen  but for some reason when you get married and you're a woman uh there's this guarantee that if the  marriage breaks up you are now uh allowed to live this life you've been accustomed to 
[00:11:30]  on the dime of the the husband why that's that's a great question why why why is that a guarantee  and uh he's saying he's broke and she's saying i you know i want i want the same things i've been  accustomed to where the hell did that come from when the hell did this happen obviously we don't have  an answer for no answer because it's really a good question though it just happens all of a sudden 
[00:12:00]  women were granted this all right no matter what happens you can live the life you've been accustomed  to uh even though there's no guarantees that that i'm going to be able to live the life that i'm  accustomed to i'll i'll say this and obviously you you're not going to comment but uh why why why does  your ex deserve what she's got in the last 10 years because that's the way the courts why though  because uh the the courts have decided that that's the way it goes and that's pretty much it and then 
[00:12:30]  mcgreevy's wife also said she said something about um god what the hell oh just handed this just in  that well sorry danny right around this time every day you know hands in the latest stuff that we can  maybe go to and the first one i see sorry to completely throw you off course here uh man hit  and killed by 20 cars on arizona highway 20 cars sorry anthony continue i apologize for that mcgreevy's 
[00:13:00]  uh that story in a little bit mcgreevy's wife was talking about how oh and he neglected the family  to uh pursue his political career and i'm just thinking isn't that the political career that gave  you this life that you're accustomed to that you want to keep like what what was he supposed to do  just uh take care of the family be a working joe you know eek out a living and then you don't have  this uh lifestyle that you become accustomed to that she's trying to you know drain him of his cash to 
[00:13:30]  to keep going well she couldn't drain him of anything else well that's true call an uncle maybe  you're kind of a that's kind of a weird case man he really embarrassed her well you know something  yeah but again where's the guarantee that's called life sometimes it just sucks and sometimes so does  your husband but it's this guarantee thing life doesn't come with a guarantee no it's whatever 
[00:14:00]  happens no one gets a guaranteed life no one yeah so why should you uh allow women to get the  guaranteed life you get a divorce it's like sorry she's got the ability to make a living  right she's a educated she's an educated woman and uh you know she's got a story right she's got a  great story she could write a book there's plenty of things she can do she doesn't have to sap off the  husband she plenty of things you can do except please a man apparently he's been from the whole

[00:20:30]  divorce cases in the end yeah the guy gets screwed what do you think sure but you know  it's not just because whoever makes the most money no it's really not  no that's that's very rare where a guy makes out in a divorce case i think we could all agree with  that i just don't know where the guarantee comes from yeah come on that she needs to have  the lifestyle that she's accustomed to why why you're with the guy you get the lifestyle  you're not with him you don't get the lifestyle that's how it works right sorry

[00:22:00]  another nick hogan i'm in prison joke warrior also thinks since terry did such a horrible job  as a father in mentoring his young son mentoring perhaps he warrior because he's taken up such a serious 
[00:22:30]  interest in mentoring he should provide some advice and that advice would be  that if you drop this soap in the shower nick and you see it drifting  drifting drifting towards the drain  don't bend over and pick it up  all right we that old gag when we played that yesterday we really thought he had a brand new

[00:32:30]  at a going away party for one of the one of the uh what one of the uh staffer one of the staff members  of channel 11 yeah so i might get you know so you're gonna have to meet all these people we've  been goofing on for the last two years i don't think i've been goofing on anybody yeah i've been  watching the news and we comment on it yeah we uh we uh have it on during our show prep yeah  certainly cool they become like family it's gonna be a little awkward let's be honest with each other 
[00:33:00]  yeah let's you're right all right well anyway they did a meet linda church and tell us you're  reminds you of ozzy in 1981 okay see this is what makes awkward moments no i love ozzy it's great i  love ozzy like that makes it better no i love ozzy and what are you going to say to smug guy when  you meet him for the first time hey i watch every morning back to you but he probably doesn't know he  does that so you'll do it he'll go what do you mean what are you talking about what are you talking 
[00:33:30]  about buy a drink seller smug guy yeah i'm gonna pull all the audio of you talking bad about channel  11 hey and then i was telling anthony uh we got to get on this maybe next week we got to pull all the  horrific audio of us talking bad about jill way before there was no this whole ad anything started  there's no bad talking we complimented her a lot not by you because i think you were secretly in 
[00:34:00]  love with her a long time ago but we said some horrific things always we went right from the  time she was in the helicopter i think it could be very awkward to play some of those old clips next  week i don't know i might be counterproductive to aunt's new relationship endeavors it could be  i don't want any awkward moments all right maybe we should leave i like pleasantries because  this whole relation thing relationship thing is getting way too real so maybe we should just  do the right thing for once in our careers anyway sex in the city it opened last night channel 11 did

[00:39:00]  some willing to dish i thought it was great i really enjoyed the show uh better than i expected  all right listen that's not that's not like uh an iron worker that's that's we said it it's good  this movie's for women and gay guys yeah yeah absolutely you're not finding a a straight gay  guy uh straight you're not finding a straight guy that is going to go see this movie i know who that  guy is i recognize his voice yeah he's uh he's a legend in new york that's herb the seat smeller

[00:40:30]  nah but you know what it's not a good question because we we sort of know her just through anthony  and she's not i think she's just not gonna drag anthony to it no like if you found a good one it's not  even a question she's like this this news reader that was on the street saying he has no choice he's got  to go see the movie with me that's just not a way to handle a relationship and if any girl drags you  to sex in the city uh you're you're so whipped you're so whipped why would you go you know what

[00:46:30]  just angry steve from bayshore brings up a good point he goes anthony you sat through hundreds of  hours of taped soap operas you know how bad could a two-hour movie be i forgot about those days just  have to drive over to uh the mother's house and sit and watch days of our lives yeah and general  hospital why because they were so what was i to do go anywhere i couldn't oh jimmy because i had  to drive her home jimmy well for a little while where was i going get a slurpee where was i going 
[00:47:00]  i was going nowhere fast upstairs to the room on the fast track there was nothing going on up there  no tv i lived through that too it was the most amazing thing anthony working his ass off making  something of himself becoming a huge radio star and then after a long day he's tired just wants to  go home he would have to go to his mother-in-law's house and it wasn't a quick pickup like all right  let's go yeah it was no now you got to hang out with me and mother and mother on the couch down in  the basement for because i was living in in that house for a while and i would watch this go down and 
[00:47:30]  aunt would have to sit there miserable for an hour to two hours and then finally get to go to his  house it was horrible and she didn't have a she didn't have a driver's license so anthony had no  choice he had to wait for her to be ready to leave to go home that's the hourglass so are the days of our lives  is this mcdonald carrie i'm mcdonald carrie and anthony these are the days of your lives 
[00:48:00]  this is mcdonald carrie yeah and these are the days of our lives they really suck anthony don't  they i would just watch that hourglass going please just end please let the sand hit the bottom  didn't he just die mcdonald carrie a while ago who knows oh he's been dead a while do you wonder if  they don't do reruns do you wonder if there's anybody who's seen every episode yeah me  so i sat there the first thing i did was mix myself a giant captain morgan and coke oh yeah

[00:50:00]  sat there and cried my eyes out like a little baby that's fine it's probably a good movie i heard  ozzy like that movie he liked the notebook yeah and he ended up crying in the movie theater  at a chick flick it was a total chick flick a theater full of women i'm crying my eyes out  the movie left out every chick in the theater is coming up to me in the lobby consoling me it was  the best night of my life the notebook well that's that's a whole alzheimer thing and i do call it 
[00:50:30]  alzheimer where she's lost her memory but then it comes back for a little while right  right steve oh yeah i remember and then there's a lot of stuff in a notebook that allows her to  remember the the love she had but then in the end her brain goes numb again of course it does  oh really yeah i think so it's a pile of scrambled eggs yeah thank you steve notebook is it's a recipe  for for eggs benedict throw her head on a piece of toast all right uh thanks for nothing brain yeah 
[00:51:00]  when we get back we got regis farting on live tv we got larry king ringtones i fought it smell it  come here gelman and we got news of the bizarre after the break i just knows of the bizarre just made  that up yeah clay aiken's gonna be a father that is bizarre 
[00:51:30]  it's the opian anthony show phone number eight seven seven two one two ona chris uh patiently  waiting through the break from new jersey what's up chris hey man what's going on how are you  now i had figure skating donna summer booty and a blowfish days of our lives and the worst of all  chinese auctions with my ex-wife bro and you were forced to watch this stuff well you know what it is  man it's the same difference you feel like you're married to these people and all of a sudden you think 
[00:52:00]  this is what you're supposed to do and i know exactly what anthony went through bro it's the bottom  i'm lying this is what you're supposed to do you know i i i could see watching figure skating with  your your woman as kind of a goof like yeah whatever i i'm doing nothing else i'll just kind of sit here  and kind of watch with you but to be forced to do these things i don't get that it's not it's good  it's not a matter of being forced it's a matter of being like having no uh no it is a matter of being 
[00:52:30]  forced because i know what happens because i kind of saw this like if you don't watch then there's a  there's a problem there's an issue like all of a sudden you have to go what's wrong uh nothing  nothing exactly yeah nothing so you're kind of being forced to watch this stuff yep  it's just if you know what it is man the bottom line is when you're younger you think this is what  you're supposed to do as you get a little older hopefully you're smart enough and you call it a day  yeah my chick tried to commit suicide and that was my way out and that was the best thing that ever 
[00:53:00]  your girlfriend tried to commit suicide why you wouldn't watch something she wanted to  not jimmy it wasn't even like that dude i was out walking a dog i came back she goes honey i did  something stupid i said well what did you just spill one on the rug she goes no i took a lot of ambient  and that was your that that that was the best dude i started the whole thing then she was checked  into the flight deck for about a week wait a minute what the flight deck the flight deck 
[00:53:30]  like the cuckoo house man she was in mountainside hospital in jersey for a week and it was great  i went to see her and she was walking around like a zombie and uh it was it was it was classic dude  so classic i love that you called it the flight deck what is it supposed to be called i don't know  no i get it now it was that's just very funny i'm giving you props uh chris  good luck bro yeah but the bottom line is all the young dudes out there if you're in one of those 
[00:54:00]  relationships just bail man there's nothing there for you zero zero zero be a man once in a while  don't take out everything's cool now man all right man punch it out all right chris i think there's  got to be an understanding that like guys and and girls that we just think differently at times  both sides have to understand that well you got to compromise that's my bit idea how about  this oh no guys call in with your favorite compromises we could do that till 10 oh my god  no jimmy let's go to lydia who just drives us nuts with her dumb voice from oceanside hi that lydia 
[00:54:30]  hi lydia you know what you always say about voices the worse it is the better looking the person  i can't imagine you're good looking with a voice like that no offense  that's no offense no offense can that not be offensive  no offense something horribly offensive no offense offense though don't take offense to it 
[00:55:00]  can you imagine having sex with lydia  what lydia i said it's hard to offend me all right what do you got for the show today  i really think that anthony needs a relationship coach because it doesn't sound like he's had very  good role models in his life and i'd hate to see him screw this thing up with jill  hmm what type of uh relationship coach would i need there are people who do life coaching 
[00:55:30]  relationship coaching not a psychologist like me i wouldn't suggest that to you anthony  not again why why would i need that i don't think he's had any kind of role models that show you  how to be in a healthy relationship what they would do jimmy's nodding i will oh wait a minute  all right she's on tv but we have a radio show and he's giving you advice about your yeah i think  that his role models have been a little unhealthy right lydia uh very much so jimmy 
[00:56:00]  his mom and his dad yeah sounds like they fought like anthony and his ex-wife except anthony  handled it a different look just because anthony cried on his wedding night and then 10 years later  finally did the right thing doesn't mean doesn't mean that he needs a relationship coach yeah maybe  i've lived and learned maybe i've lived and learned there lydia uh perhaps you have anthony i just 
[00:56:30]  hate to see you screw it up with jill it seems like a nice thing for you i'm not i don't i don't  really like once i get into a uh a relationship let's say uh i i don't screw it up we all have our  fingers crossed behind your back i'll just say that lydia don't you see a real pattern of unhealthy  behavior developing absolutely just like historically what look at anthony and jill's first date yeah  what about it lydia what about it what about it well you know i think you have a boundary problem 
[00:57:00]  anthony what boundary problem you're not being specific what was a problem with uh the description  of our first date yeah well of course you both can miss work yep that's not a healthy relationship  why isn't that healthy it's sort of spontaneous fun it's exciting it's everything a relationship  should be don't you think or at least a date should be i'm not even talking relationship at this point 
[00:57:30]  i think that is what should uh i think that's what what a date should be fun exciting spontaneous  it should last longer than you think uh it's going to last it should be um every uh moment of it  should be fun right a date should be all those things but it shouldn't interfere with what we call  your occupational functioning right oh yeah that's the boundary issue not knowing when to stop and it 
[00:58:00]  sounds like i don't know jill sounds a little addictive doesn't it lydia  that's why you guys are talking to each other lydia doesn't it sound a little codependent and  addictive no he's the worst i don't want to go that far jimmy i don't know enough to say that that  that wouldn't be fair that's why i said sounds like as opposed to like you know could you speak  to the judge sure we're just chit-chatting here all right so we got to get a relationship coach for um  anthony yeah while we're at it we should get him a life coach i i don't think i need that a life 
[00:58:30]  coach maybe what what what would your idea of a good date be my idea of a good day it would be  exactly the same as yours except they get home in time to go to work right yep wait wait wait wait wait  you know something it what about spontaneity what about fun what about excitement what about 
[00:59:00]  throwing caution to the wind what about responsibility well yeah but the part of  throwing caution to the wind is is sometimes you throw responsibility out the window just  for your own uh pleasure what about responsibility to your your your friends and your co-workers and to  the radio show and and to the millions of listeners that expect us to be on the air every morning look  i knew me not showing up was going to make a great break great material i sacrificed myself by not coming 
[00:59:30]  in oh yeah because that's how you think are you kidding just worked out that way well lydia you're  saying that that he probably doesn't know when to stop what what are you saying i'm saying that because  anthony has never seen a healthy relationship or been in one he doesn't know what it feels right  yep can't i understand that a date on tuesday night that's spontaneous yep don't you understand that 
[01:00:00]  perhaps i don't need an example that perhaps people don't need these examples from their parents and other  people to teach them what they want or need in life maybe i just like uh uh the way i do things that i  don't need a teacher to do that i'm i'm i'm my own person and i enjoy doing certain things and i'll do them  that's right anthony likes being reckless a little bit and alcoholic 
[01:00:30]  i understand that just made up a word i love it alcoholic  i just think that maybe you and jill should get to know each other without alcohol and  jesus christ like every minute we spend together we're drunk all right let me ask this and you  don't you could plead the fifth anthony because i i don't know where to go with this anymore because  i i'm starting to think this is a real thing and i respect that one thing about me i do respect 
[01:01:00]  relationships and things like that uh you uh had kind of a date yesterday uh yeah how much alcohol  was involved just just following lydia's uh line of questioning well uh we were kind of doing uh like  an interview there was an interview being done with who captain morgan what do you mean interview  yeah there's like a web interview that was being done i'll let you know about it i'll i'll get the link  and and stuff to you but uh yeah what it's like a web interview with you and jill yeah for for what

[01:07:30]  york city times square two one two seven five seven forty one hundred if you can't make uh tonight's  show uh for other uh uh uh comedy dates go to nick dip dot com i was just thinking about what you were  saying about what uh the whole sex in the city thing yeah nick just had a a great rant on the  whole sex in the city thing but we're in commercials he couldn't help himself well i was listening to  you guys in the way in here laughing my ass i mean like it's news it's breaking news that it was  mostly chicks that went to the movie it's written by the gayest bruce valanche type idiots 
[01:08:00]  the show's garbage it always was and uh and it's a big oh there's no men there is that how feminized  society is really yeah that you disappointed men who's going to show up to the thing ray lewis and  art donovan and guys from world war ii vets i mean  i can't even relate to this crap i really wear their vfw hats yeah exactly walk in finally a movie 
[01:08:30]  for us right i like charlie right oh please i can relate to carrie myself we are in the height of  mediocrity that they can even make a movie like that i played this earlier and uh knowing that nick  was coming in today i was thinking about you as uh as i was listening to this clip i want to play it  again it's really quick but basically this uh this reporter was on the street and commenting that it  was only men that went to see sex in the city for the most part but listen what she she says about 
[01:09:00]  her man listen to this well you're headed out to see the new sex in the city movie tonight ladies  well don't try to bring your boyfriend or husband for that matter looks like the average  man has no desire to sit through two hours of cosmos stilettos and female bonding and all the  fashion stuff and tamsin fidel live it reaches some regal cinemas in times square with more tamsin  well good morning my husband has no choice he is sitting through it hopefully this weekend  how thick are her ankles oh kind of butch haircut but but there was no humor like she was trying to 
[01:09:30]  make a little joke she wasn't she's dead serious he has no choice he will be at the theater with me  yeah if he knows what's good for him didn't you guys say he was in a wheelchair was that just a  joke oh that's just a joke was that you know i was crying on the way in here  he'll sit through he's got no choice well he doesn't put something in the spoke so he can't  back out just chalk up the wheels yeah obviously the clip needed humor and that's you know thank  god jimmy was there to deliver did you hear her yeah oh he has no choice choice she really believes 
[01:10:00]  that really how about a short right hand to the tip of your nose that's a choice  have a seat in your beanbag chair you bon bonnie i can't wait to get off the earth i used to be  depressed i was 46 seriously closer to just leaving the planet to god it's got to be better  it's got to be better more peaceful i don't know like sex in the city that's got no men and nick goes  i can't wait to get off the earth yeah i want to overreact yeah yeah really well you know the girls 
[01:10:30]  are back in the city i want to be dead not just about that but everything in general just i don't  know this i mean come on iron man sorry you know sorry i used to like girls when i was in fifth grade  and played baseball yeah uh you know is there anything out there for me sex in the city iron  man nerdy stupid yeah anything or chick stuff raging bull too where's the next cuckoo's nest uh 
[01:11:00]  right uh maybe i hear it's sex in the city i hear they're all nuts  you know nick is absolutely right but i'm starting to also think that nick gets bothered by the sun  every day too no i'm not that all right good although that you know any other age spots on my  forehead i was up for 10 minutes yesterday any other example  i look like mccain's back i have all these welts and yeah that ozone is not the wrong i'm  starting to believe all these green hippie whale saving fags have a point because you said nick's 
[01:11:30]  bothered by the sun and he actually addressed the one no no that's what i'm saying like the sun's  fine by me yeah yeah i know i should have just not acknowledged that i'm sure you'd be saying that  tongue-in-cheek but he's right about that though when uh you get a little older and you go out in  the sun also it's like what is all these spots that appear just because i got a little sun well no i  i went out my bathrobe to get the newspaper what's that a 30 second trip i come back i had a red v  on my chest from where my robe was well i mean that shouldn't happen as strong as this sun these 
[01:12:00]  seriously man it's definitely it's uh poor mccain did you see the chart of everything wrong with him  other than his politics what he's no republican they went from head to toe with everything oh that's  right he's a tough old bugger though you're not gonna kill him no he had bayonets stuck into  his groin area yeah i think we put that up on a radio.com a day or two ago if you want to check  it out but wow there's a lot wrong with mr mccain physically i know it was like reading a checklist 
[01:12:30]  of a 77 volkswagen beetle stuff falling off and rustic you know it's like i think it's still  worth and then at the end you're like but i think it's still worth buying absolutely i could fix this  up a little bit i just like his crazy smile it's like you know after you take a good dump on a  sunday morning you got that grin he looks he's crazy is that clear i don't even know if that  clears whatever yeah we're gonna move on to something that uh just like yeah that's fine well um  funny you should say that as we move on this is a great clip regis farting on live tv what a segue 
[01:13:00]  he just lost it right there in his uh chair on his stool uh for the people that want to jump ahead  regis farts on youtube if you want to go there and it'll be up on is it up on onaradio.com  in seconds all right uh let's rate in this clip although i don't hate regis if he farted and then  just grabbed his chest and fell face first like not that you want to see the guy die necessarily oh  that's hot if he has to die what a way to go i want to see a clip of kelly ripa spotting 
[01:13:30]  well god bless kelly in this clip because you know when this type of thing happens uh your  your reaction is to make believe it didn't happen kelly's laughing hysterically and regis just wants  to move on saw me i doubt it anyway uh next week is um uh we're doing something around here  what is this all about thanksgiving's secret reveal what is this all about yeah like he had 
[01:14:00]  no control of his own ass i'm the ripper i ripped one ripper  was that piped in yeah his face looked like like gleason when mr marshall walked in and caught  him in his desk i'm not i'm not he just had a frozen smile on his face what was he wearing a  mic on his tailbone that was crystal clear man that really did come through that's what is this 
[01:14:30]  all about here what is this all about commenting about what commenting about what kelly's saying  i'm 46 and i'll i'll laugh till i'm 110 out of the fart oh yeah he always said uh fart equals funny  oh my god kelly especially coming out of a 80 year old guy yeah it's like a sewage uh treatment plant  it smells like over here kelly he should have just turned away kelly what did you do you can't blast  out farts on a show i gotta hear that again i want to hear him all right blast it out and then uh 
[01:15:00]  comment i thought it was gonna be like a little that was like it was like something out of animal  house here it is on me i doubt it anyway uh next week is um uh we're doing  that's right out of the bean scene in uh blazing saddles he might as well just lean to his left and  lift lift his cheek take that one there you go he's got new suit pants on in the next scene that's 
[01:15:30]  definitely a change of clothes required you don't own real estate these days you don't own a popcorn  thought who wanted someone step on a duck  let's do it again i doubt it anyway uh next week is um uh we're doing something around here  what is this kelly's thanksgiving and by this i mean the spot in my shorts how about kelly she  she starts laughing but she stayed pretty composed i would have been dying i would have been

[01:31:00]  one of my favorite uh jimmy stories it really is we're at the brooklyn diner after one of our radio  shows all right i like it already were we on the air again home of the 30 dollar hutton we've this  this this giraffe walks past the window like you know how tall you have to be you could just see  his belt buckle when he was yeah it was like a toys r us ad you don't you don't see anyone's head  if you're sitting in those booths unless you're looking up and over yeah this this monster walks 
[01:31:30]  by the window jimmy goes holy ass that's randy johnson no you recognize him you're like that's  randy johnson i'm sorry really so i'm like come with me let's see a picture and open such a trooper  he came out with me we follow this and i'm camera guy gargantuan nothing down the street and everyone  recognizes him because he's 6 11 yeah so i walk up to him on the corner i go hey man i'm a fan can i get  a picture he goes oh no thank you and he crosses the street no thank you thank you yeah jimmy no  thank you and and you can see jimmy just going but but but as and randy's just moving across the 
[01:32:00]  intersection at that point i hate his guts so i took a picture of randy's back as jimmy's going but  but oh that's why i don't go up to famous people ever just for that reason right there i don't want  and if it's somebody i like i don't want to hate him the rest of my life i know i hate him i swear  to god i hope he steps into a manhole and like the one leg stays outside and the other leg goes in  and just rips his groin up to his nose i hate him he's done nothing but kill the yankees when he 
[01:32:30]  played for seattle and arizona i never wanted him in his bad back sandy duncan stubbed me when i was in  fifth grade oh i never liked her work since i walked up to the wrong side she's like i hear a voice  right somebody offering me a week then that's right oh glass-eyed fool just pop that thing out  oh here's the picture put the picture up on onadradio.com there's randy john this is  jim norton's celebrity picture with randy johnson this is the best i could do that's randy johnson  all the way across the street and jimmy is somewhere over here oh did i get his back too hold on yeah 
[01:33:00]  he's in the white shirt with the red top yeah no i know his head on the traffic lights  we'll put this picture up on onaradio.com again the it was uh big monster it was a monster movie  called clover douche get it yeah all right so you want to do the mariners game this poor woman getting  kicked out of a game for kissing another woman here we go some chant some scream but one couple learned 
[01:33:30]  the hard way don't kiss he goes well there's a lady that said that her son saw you guys making out  and i've seen it too and it needs to stop i was like well we weren't making out but we were kissing  and i'm not going to stop like sabrina guerrero says she only gave her date a peck on the lips but  a mother sitting with her son complained to security and they were told to stop or leave  please says the only reason why she got called out was because her date was a girl because her date

[01:59:00]  for you boys was he looking oh is that the weatherman yeah more bragging well he sure certainly  likes to brag he's quite the braggart yeah he is mr g we did that day about what oh you jim you would  love them quite the pressure systems no well does he bang a lot of chicks all right i don't know  what mr g wants uh to admit at this point in time but uh you'd be surprised that satellite map i got 
[01:59:30]  the impression that he doesn't really give a crap about doing  he wants to talk about everything but can i see a fine weather uh reporting mr g and he bragged he was  62 years young or something like that terrell owens there's t-o looking just saunters in all  smooth hello there we need to walk around like that how are you terrell what terrell terrell i told 
[02:00:00]  him that see yeah all right of course they sent you the wrong address yeah jesus some organization we got  here that's all right what is it you're most sick of talking about because i know you're probably  getting a lot of the interview questions so we won't what are you what are you most sick of the  dumb reporters asking you about uh right right now yeah just in general like what you've been dealing  with for the last yeah that's what you've been doing this promotion um not much everything's been 
[02:00:30]  pretty cool so far you know i think uh the most thing that uh the best thing that i've been talking  about this morning is really the alzheimer's uh association uh champion thing that i've that i'm  part of this year what made you get involved with it is is it just something you wanted to do because  you want to do a charity or is somebody like close to you affected with it or what my grandmother my  grandmother i was raised by her and uh you know she's been very dear and uh you know to my heart and so 
[02:01:00]  uh you know once she got diagnosed with the disease um it was it was pretty much a no-brainer you  you know for me to kind of get involved with alzheimer's association and i i got involved  when i was in san francisco and uh basically everywhere that i've been so are people surprised  to kind of see this side of you let me let's be honest on on on the field you're not what are you  guys doing getting the mic close okay well you can signal you guys can't see but terrible is talking  and we got stunt brain is kneeling and pushing the thing in and steve's got his big greasy hands in 
[02:01:30]  the poor man's face just making sure people hear him that's all it's like the pesky crew  no but instead of just saying move your mic in they're like oh we'll do it yeah uh so like you  know on the field obviously you're not the same guy that you are well i mean for me it's really it's  not a big deal about you know me trying to um you know make people see who i am on the inside um  only i know who i am um you know as a person um versus uh the portrayal of me uh obviously when 
[02:02:00]  i'm on the football field that's my job that's what i do i bring the passion to the game and um  you know that that that's what allows me to to be able to uh produce and and and do the things that  i do in the football field um aside from that you know my personality i'm i'm pretty i'm pretty laid  back and you know i am a caring i'm i am a genuine person you know despite you know what people hear  about me do you plan on doing because some of the things you do are really funny i mean uh like  you know like mocking the uh patriots holding up the football as a camera i mean there's some great 
[02:02:30]  stuff you've done just to really irritate the other team well you know i just try to be creative man i  just to have fun uh with the game of football i think a lot of guys and a lot of fans out there you  know they they enjoy and they like what i do and um it's not offensive and by any means and you  know i just just try to go out there and just have fun and entertain the fans at the  same time how much have you paid in fines over the years uh i don't know i haven't really are you 
[02:03:00]  afraid to add it up like you like let them deal with it no i don't want to know you know it is what  it is i think uh even though uh you know we get fined i think uh they use the money that you know to  to go to you know different and various various charities you know um that they you know put it  towards but they should allow all that stuff to happen i i love uh you know seeing you guys get  creative out there well yeah i mean uh i think you know not not only just myself uh you know  chad johnson a good friend of mine and you know he brings another element and uh you know to the 
[02:03:30]  excitement of the game and so uh you know i think you know long as long as it's not offensive you know  um you know towards anybody or um they should just let us go out there and have fun but i mean i think  they're they're trying to you know take away from the fun of the game a little bit but uh other than that  yeah you try to still try to find creative ways to to do it do you have animosity towards like the  philly fans because i mean there was all this weird stuff that went on in philadelphia and obviously  the the donovan uh mcnab comments and i mean do you really resent philly or do you have nice memories 
[02:04:00]  of it or no no i i have no uh no ill feelings towards philly fans at all i just think uh they were  misled you know uh with a lot of leaks and sources as far as uh really what happened um during that  situation and my transition from you know from philly to to leading to me to where i am now with  the thallus cowboys um so you know you know with that being said you know i i really i'm very comfortable  with where i am i'm very comfortable and and how things panned out um obviously would i have 
[02:04:30]  liked to to have stayed there sure but um under you know some circumstances it didn't allow that  tarryl did did uh the cowboys and jerry jones did he when you first got there did he say look you're  not going to pull any of that crap that you did in philly he didn't give you like a lecture and  say you got to change your behavior or no nothing like that it was nothing anything like that we  know we haven't even had a conversation like that and i think uh you know jerry did did his homework  as far as you know who i am as a person through through people that he knows that that knows me and 
[02:05:00]  even uh some college i mean some college guys coaches and even some uh you know nfl coaches that  that know me on a personal level so i mean he did his homework as far as um you know background  check and all that stuff um regardless of what was said and you know who was saying it um other  than that like i said i know who i am and i know what happened you know with the things that happened  in philly and i think uh some of the fans really you know they just got misled with some of the 
[02:05:30]  information so you and does donovan you and mcnab have any kind of relationship or not at all no  man we're we're friends and you know um you know i've moved on and i'm sure he has and you know i  have a job you know with the dallas cowboys just like he has a job to uh to do with the philadelphia  eagles uh it was a situation that uh you know a bad situation that um that happened and you know  probably you know honestly if if there were some things that i probably could have done differently  then yeah but you know at this point it is what it is it's you know it's in the back of my mind now 
[02:06:00]  who would you say i know there was one time you i think you were celebrating when you're with san  francisco you're out in midfield in dallas and i think it was a george teague came and gave you  kind of a shot just for uh i think that's who it was yeah yeah yeah who gave you would you say in  your career the hardest shot you've taken um hmm i've taken a lot of a lot of shots and uh  i mean watching from the from the sidelines or watching on tv you know they're they're they're brutal 
[02:06:30]  shots but you know i've kept myself in in great shape i've always kind of just bounced back and  bounced up you know from from from the hard hits but i i right now i just can't i can't think of uh  you know one one hard shot maybe it's because of the hard hit that's the ones you forget real  quick you're like wow who's that guy getting oh that's me i've been working out and um  i can tell i appreciate that i mean i mean he's not gonna he means that yeah my abs though what 
[02:07:00]  should i do for my abs because i'm really having a problem um stop eating cake yeah that's that's  one thing a lot of people don't know you should try this guy's uh this uh his breakfast right here  he has a bowl of uh cantaloupes uh that's it you know it's all i eat if you saw what he drank it's  like a bowl of cantaloupe and then vodka until tomorrow morning i don't i'll keep you ripped  yeah uh i mean it's all those muscles in shape as you're puking every morning you know it's all 
[02:07:30]  about dieting and um i learned a lot you know since uh my my fourth year in the league you know and  that's when i obtained my my trainer who's in atlanta so uh you know i've maintained uh a good  lifestyle and obviously i've kept myself in great shape over the years and and obviously uh a big  key element as just uh just the way i train and uh you know last year i launched my own little  workout uh gym and uh you can find out a lot of information about it on uh tobands.com and uh i  use a lot of resistant bands you know now uh for the last year and a half as well as a lot of you know 
[02:08:00]  dumbbells and free weights but uh this year you know i feel like i'm really like in the best shape  of my life you know and it's uh due to you know you know the different things that i do as far as uh  my my workout regimen you like being with dallas would you say more than san francisco i mean that's  kind of an awkward question because you're playing for them now but as an organization  i mean uh uh how do they compare to san francisco and philadelphia well i think uh my my first year  uh with the san francisco uh 49ers i think everyone knows the the tradition there uh that eddie de bartolo 
[02:08:30]  and and and and that camp provided um but i really never really got a chance to really you know benefit  from it you know because i was there that one year and then there were some things that kind of  happened with that situation so uh with the playboy interview no i don't know anything about that  but uh it was sort of like a changing changing of the guard so uh um you know everything kind of  just changed and it wasn't the same and um now um i'm with the dallas cowboys and obviously you know 
[02:09:00]  tradition has you know you don't have to really have to say and speak too much about the dallas  cowboys i mean we're we're america's team uh the probably like the most uh watched team um across  the country so um just being with jerry jones and and and it's phenomenal you know i just just just  knowing the tradition and the history there you know you got troy aikman michael irvin um you know  and a number of other guys um just to be part of that is something special how do you feel about uh pac-man 
[02:09:30]  maybe being a new teammate well i mean we're just uh waiting right now for reinstatement and uh he's  gonna be a great addition to our defensive backfield and obviously with his return skills uh definitely  going to help us uh um you know with our special teams play so uh we're we're just looking for and  forward to him uh being on the field and making plays and and for all that to happen you know we're  waiting for the reinstatement how about off the field his antics do they bother you at all his past 
[02:10:00]  behavior well i think uh with the year off that he's had you know i think that really has put a  lot of things in perspective uh you know as far as his life and his career so i'm pretty sure you  know uh he's gonna probably curb a lot of things that he's uh um that he's done and and will do in  the future is there anybody that jerry jones won't sign probably not you know that's an honest answer at  least yeah you know what you know jerry's uh he's a guy that you know uh he he's just talking to him 
[02:10:30]  personally he's gone through some hardships and he told he has really just sat down and talked to me  about how he got to be where he is and it wasn't an easy road and it was all about you know somebody  giving him a chance and so i think uh you know with his life experiences he's he's more apt to give  somebody a chance that nobody else would and that and you know that's that's that's all about about life and  what you've learned about life they hated him in dallas too when he first came because he gave 
[02:11:00]  landry the boot yeah i think there was like one year left on his contract contract like just take  your hat and hit the bricks stupid scram and uh i i kind of felt jimmy johnson should have stayed  longer i wish he had kind of uh i mean after they won two back-to-back super bowls and then johnson  kind of left to go you know play with the awful dolphins i mean i think he just wanted to get  away from jerry jones but uh all right whatever but i like that he brought barry switzer in too  who i always like from oklahoma anyone who brings a pistol to the airport you have to be happy  that's what i'm saying he was a you know kind of a tough guy you went when you went with 
[02:11:30]  philadelphia i mean there's got to be a thing with you in philly because you wore an irvin jersey  he put on a michael irvin jersey and went out in public i mean that's got to be like you  couldn't have made philadelphia people madder if you just put two big middle fingers on a hat  and walk to the veteran stadium i mean they really gave you a lot of crap for that  well it was really just me just showing support and i've always uh you know since i've been in san  francisco i watched michael from afar and you know across the sidelines so uh you know for me you  know it was no big deal you know it doesn't matter you know what i what i wear i mean i could have worn 
[02:12:00]  a dress and you know i mean it would have been something said about that uh thing that really  matters is what i do in the football field well they philadelphia let's be honest we're syndicated  we love philadelphia but they're the worst people alive i mean we have to admit that i mean they're our  fans they are the worst people alive well you know they know they are they're terrible people  i mean they they they love you and they'll love you and they'll hate you at the same time yeah and  when i was there you know um there was a lot of love and then when i left i know there was a lot of 
[02:12:30]  hate and when i came back to the stadium there was a lot of a lot of booze uh and i explained to a lot  of people i mean you know they asked me that did it bother me i'm like no not really because i think  they really some people really got what what happened and what went on and you know and i tell  people there was a lot of love in those booze that i received veteran stadium has a jail in it i mean  it's like it's like it's like playing football in southern iraq why would anybody want to be involved  with veteran stadium you're probably very happy to be away from philadelphia and again we love people 
[02:13:00]  from philadelphia but they're just awful you know i i enjoyed i enjoyed are you getting the message  i enjoyed feeling when i was there and and i honestly i have you know nothing bad to say about  you know the the city of philadelphia um it was just a situation with management where you know we  didn't see eye to eye and um you know they stood their ground i stood my ground and so uh it was it  was a situation where i don't think we could have could have coexisted you know i felt like i put my career 
[02:13:30]  on the line and um you know once uh there was there were talks and leaks of me trying to demand  a new contract that was totally untrue um and that's what i think kind of got uh probably the  city you know on the bad side and so uh you know like i said i i kind of i knew what was going on and  you know when they released those uh those comments and and those speculations it was just just totally  untrue do you think that they just wanted you uh they just wanted you to leave i mean it was just  like yeah this is after the mcnab thing when they kind of did you this for what they suspended you 
[02:14:00]  for four games and what did they just they just sat you for the rest no i think it was just they just  wanted to put me in a bad position in the public eye you know and uh and and and they accomplished that  that goal and you know and i just and i found myself really trying to uh really defend myself in a lot  of ways and and so uh once you know you know they they got misinformed about what was going on then  it was just kind of just i was fighting an uphill battle um but other than that you know they they  tried to find um they tried to compound a lot of things and they tried to find everything 
[02:14:30]  and and bring up everything to kind of you know make me look bad in a sense and uh you know obviously  you know in my contract you know they if there were certain things that i did or whatnot if i was  suspended for like one or more games then you know i had to you know give back my signing bonus and  initially i was only suspended you know i wasn't even really suspended you know i was just kind of it  it wasn't a suspension it was just me sitting out a game that's not that that's not considered a 
[02:15:00]  suspension and so uh they they put their two heads together and try to figure out some things uh  to try to make that thing happen and so yeah it happened and did they get the signing bonus back  well yeah i think uh there was a situation where i have to you know repay a portion of that back and  you know i have no problem with that you know um you know like i said i'm in a better situation now  um i i i i'm with the team and um i'm with the gracious owner who who really gave me my market  value and and what i deserve and that's all i ever wanted do you get a little emotional after 
[02:15:30]  last year's game right i mean it was was it the press the way they were treating this situation or  what was it that got to you at the end yeah i think so it was more you know way they were trying to make  uh uh more of a situation more out of a situation than than it really needed to be and you know obviously  you know tony's personal life is his personal life and if somebody gives i'm pretty sure if  your boss gave you a break and told you to go do whatever then i'm pretty sure you go to tahiti  or whatever or bahamas you know brazil with jessica i'd go to newark exactly so i mean you know he he did 
[02:16:00]  what he did in his off time and i think everybody made you know too much of that you know off time that  he had regardless of of of what time it was during the during the course of the season it could have  been in the beginning of the season or the middle of the season i don't think uh what he did with  his girlfriend as far as taking time off and relaxing getting away from football had anything  to do with that with the way we played you know that day so those sorry jim those tears those tears 
[02:16:30]  you were crying with legitimate tears i mean i don't know what was fake about them i mean i didn't  have any i don't know i know in the movies i don't know you know they put some things in your eyes  to make you cry but uh you know i think uh you know that's just me as a as a person um really  caring about my teammate and you know tony and i we established a friendship you know before we even  even had the starting job so i consider him a good friend and really just i mean he's like a brother to  me let me ask you because i i've uh but i've been a cowboy fan for many years it was very difficult to 
[02:17:00]  root for the giants this year uh in the super bowl but how nice was it to see the look on brady's  stupid face bite your tongue you son of a bitch i forgot you're from boston but how nice was it  just to see them going down the toilet without that undefeated record it wasn't that come on  honestly i didn't even watch the game you didn't you didn't watch the super bowl i didn't even watch  it see that i was on a date i was watching i went to the movies uh i saw the bucket list wow oh my god 
[02:17:30]  hilarious you probably had like 30 seats to yourself i thought there was a lot of people on the bucket  yeah taro let me ask you a question as far as spy gate goes do you feel like you uh gypped out  of a super bowl ring you know what how do you feel about that possibly um you know like they say  well there's smoke there's a fire and so uh obviously there was something you know there has  been something to it so um you know you know they say sometimes you know if you're not cheating 
[02:18:00]  you're not trying i want to go back to the super bowl why wouldn't you watch the super bowl that's  really interesting i don't know it was the first one probably that i that i haven't watched i just  i just didn't really have a desire to watch it you know and i think uh especially you know just  just the way our season in uh ended you know i just i just wasn't i was kind of anti-football for a  minute i'm probably just still just going through my little phase of really just trying to get over  the loss and so uh you know i just you know more importantly how how was the bucket list  i had it we didn't see it it was a good movie uh obviously got two two great actors in that 
[02:18:30]  morgan freeman jack nicholson and uh you know and i had uh i had a pretty fine date had the date work  out yeah better it was good it's all right lots of popcorn we definitely got to get out of here  we're a little late we got to make sure we get uh the info out for the charity there yeah  terrell owens uh promoting the alzheimer's uh association organization campaign now the website is uh  alz.org alz.org or uh terrell owens.com t-e-r-r-e-l-l-o-w-e-n-s.com and uh you can 
[02:19:00]  get all the information there but i mean it's obviously a great cause and you know you know  most of us have somebody affected by it yep i mean this uh it is a great cause and i'm very honored to  be on the alzheimer's association uh uh uh board this year and i'm a spokesperson for that and uh it's  really just really to kind of educate people on the realities of alzheimer's and uh um like i said  me being involved is is because you know i've been affected you know by a family member and my

[02:23:30]  here yes look at the beads of sweat on his forehead and jimmy i gotta got jaundice i gotta start by  saying i was wrong to roland he gave me this movie uh called foot fist way it's a movie that what will  farrell uh discovered uh yeah somebody slipped it to will farrell and he washed it him and adam mckay  and he bought the distribution jimmy was right i will explain in a second what the  fuck was that jimmy was right uh foot fist way you gave it to me i i didn't really know what to 
[02:24:00]  make of the movie i have honestly resisted watching it but i i i shouldn't i'm annoyed at  will farrell because you didn't call him last time that's kind of stupid of me i admit yeah but um  i don't know that the main character of foot fist way is terrific he's like a master poe type  character yeah this is his thinking who think he's all that so what is your synopsis of that yeah  what's uh foot fist way all about it's like um yeah  this is all we're gonna do on xx today 
[02:24:30]  at the end of the commercial all right what roland foot fist way um he is like a the master of the  demo uh he plays fred simmons is that a real guy or is it like a character okay it's his character  and uh he's he's simply adorable yeah  all right go ahead and uh it's just it's really funny though his sayings and what he does what's  he say 
[02:25:00]  it's like truman capote  jesus christ it's the water coming right out of you and the movie's getting really good reviews and  i like i said i didn't know what to think of his fucking head yeah and it's uh  is a very ticklish boy he certainly is jimmy goes to me we got to get rolling in here because 
[02:25:30]  and i don't know how you knew this but you you told me that when you tickle roll in he makes  silly noises sounds like a girl scout in a funny movie i actually discovered it accidentally  what do you mean really i missed and hit his taint no i just tickled him what happens  a goof because he's just you know roland's just so lovable he was just standing i just was just  joking and i tickled him to be stupid he went and i said file that noise that has to happen 
[02:26:00]  again unbelievable by the way since roland sat down we're up to 86.2 and rising fast yeah in  the xm studios rolling right now his forehead he looks like he's testifying at a child pornography  trial  jesus you are sweating i'm a wet are you all right yeah i'm a mexican wetback you're a wetback but that  was because of the swim over the rio grande somebody sprayed pam on your forehead what are  they cooking up some eggs for everybody on your forehead i don't know oh wow so what do we should 
[02:26:30]  what should we do with foot fist way now i'm thinking we got to support this guy in the movie  he should call in he's really funny dude will he come in or no um he's filming in l.a okay  by the way his wife in the movie worst actress ever ever just a friend obviously she's never done  acting before it's so not believable when she's on screen with the guy the guy's hilarious though  how he talks to his students and everything yeah and his character is pretty funny because he does uh 
[02:27:00]  oh my god and bigger uh stronger faster got uh great reviews 100 uh positive reviews on rotten  tomatoes so far the steroid movie yeah yeah i want to see that that one and we interviewed the guy  he was he was a lot of fun that one and fist fist way are the top two musty movies yeah  this is our new bit movie reviews with laughing rolling write it down we start we do this weekly 
[02:27:30]  now it's funny if you did it while he's reviewing like schindler's list  exactly and then he said they have little hands that can clean the munitions  did you see sex in the city rolling uh i did not why not you see every movie that comes out i'll  i'll see this week and but i want you to see foot this way again yeah and we got to keep him in  here because now the sweat is dripping into his eyes and it's fucking i've never seen anybody 
[02:28:00]  spot like this looks like moses malone that's a foul line boston garden in 1986 i'm with you nick i'm  with you but the but the guy said he would call into the show yeah get right on mike there with your  sweaty forehead get him a headband oh yeah it's going into his eyes holy is it stingy yes look no one  else is sweating is this aerobic exercise for you rolling wears like fucking short sleeve shirts  it's literally 30 degrees out and he's bumbling down the street or yeah in the winter he'll wear that 
[02:28:30]  yeah they'll wear that in the winter he's never cold no but he gets hot he doesn't own a winter  coat did you just say that i'm sorry no i'm staring at this fucking crane across the street wondering  when it's our turn i know what the fuck we have one of these huge cranes literally right across the  street right behind anthony's head and if that thing fell like the one that just fell on the upper east  side here in new york we'd be it was the sound coming out of that thing would be like  you know can we do like uh i don't know i'm thinking like an all-out can we put you on the 
[02:29:00]  floor with microphones maybe allow the listeners that showed up today to tickle you for like 10  seconds no they're begging rolling they're begging no they're very ticklish come on we'll end the  tickle bit with you just getting tickled by like 10 dudes no that's awkward it is how about just one  dude how about master poe ew no who do you want to tickle you yeah how about sam sam looks like he's a 
[02:29:30]  good tickler who would you like to tickle you you don't have a choice um jimmy i guess okay but  jimmy's been tickling you can he sit on your belly he can tickle you i can see my reflection  in his forehead right yeah it really is amazing it's like a fucking mirror roland also turned me  on to surf wise which was amazing uh the heckler what what was the best movie you've seen in the  last uh couple weeks it has probably is the foot fist way foot fist way it sounds dirty there 
[02:30:00]  hasn't been i mean there's been okay movies do we have a trailer for foot fist way just to maybe  give uh people a little taste there's a red band trailer on youtube yeah all we have to do is  click and go yes all right let's give it a shot foot fist way the trailer  all right hold on let's turn this off because right now you're sucking last august a film was  slipped to will ferrell and adam mckay do you think y'all can handle this 
[02:30:30]  yes yeah taekwondo is a deadly serious killing system since then they have watched it at least  20 times it's the best of all martial arts i hear jujitsu is really good for balance  no jujitsu sucks they quote it you're just a man who is overweight and has breasts the size of a female  they obsess over it you like to party i'll give you a call mr simmons i really need to go practice my  wow you just feel that what i mean we totally just connected right there and now they want to 
[02:31:00]  share it i'm noticing that a lot of y'all are just throwing single kicks and punches what you need to  be doing is following those through with some combinations walk with the right distracting back  fist and spin crescent kick gotcha didn't you rick no i was just doing what you told me to do  i think marge and i know different don't we marge yes sir you come with whatever you got full  contact i don't think you're going to like how this ends hot shot 
[02:31:30]  we just knocked out the old lady  the trailer would have been more enjoyable but they put that stupid movie music in there like  they keep stopping the sound yeah but the red band trailer is better because it has cussing and 
[02:32:00]  everything in it oh i don't like cussing has cussing has cussing in it they show more of it  here's a question i would like to ask roland yeah just look at the camera too what is your favorite  curse  what's that about come on oh that laugh it is so ridiculous people out there are going to think  that you're putting it no it's when i was a kid my brother used to torture me just kind of so ticklish  and just feel me to death i stand in the same way but you still have the laugh as in a 
[02:32:30]  belt that you had when you were six where are you ticklish most yeah i don't know just around  it's just i'm ticklish your arms ticklish no and your nipples just my stomach area it's like ticklish  i don't know why yeah  oh my god  oh my god  oh my god  oh gave her all a good tickling  it's the cutest sound ever  it really is you want to just hold them and hold them  i know  then you realize he's sweaty 
[02:33:00]  and then you prefer not to  look at him sweat  no it's awful  well it'd be funny every time someone tickled him he came  sounds like he might be  uh trailer sucks movie is awesome i don't really know what to think of foot this way it might be  like a napoleon dynamite it gets better the more you watch it or something it does i saw  five times already five times five yeah jesus all right well rolling that's like what crazy people  do uh to a movie that many times thanks for bringing uh joy to the show 
[02:33:30]  terrell terrell owen uh to the show he's a monster and i was telling nick just before we  start here at xm i want to go back in time and beat the shit out of myself thinking that i i  actually had a shot at professional sports well you did because you see a guy like this like jimmy  said he put his arm around his back just for the picture and he was just an animal right  yeah i mean uh we got the photo together and like you know i you just touch a guy's waist  or whatever you get the photo or like his ribs and he is it's like he's like a rock what if 
[02:34:00]  he giggled like him whatever he did would have been an odd combination yeah absolutely but he  he really is there is a certain thing like you're born with that to a certain degree too plus hours  of work and juice yeah you think so no not with him he is because he's not that big like he's big  but he's like no he's an athletic yeah he looks like his biceps were as big as my thighs no but i  mean like he's not like freakishly like he has to be on roids yeah no yeah you're right he understands  what to eat i mean he looks like he could be a track star he's got that kind of lean kind of 
[02:34:30]  yeah you know i mean i love when we ask these athletes like workout advice we all know what  we're supposed to do well they just look not eat the dessert and and move around a little bit more  than we we do yeah stop putting cake in your mouth but we all ask because we're hoping for that uh  that miracle like oh just the secret thing yeah the secret thing actually if you eat too much cake  it goes the other way and you'll lose weight is that what we're all hoping for uh and uh this is  why our show is very different than other shows uh turrell said something and none of us had the 
[02:35:00]  balls to touch it none of us and i i gotta acknowledge everybody that wrote on instant feedback they they  picked up on it all did i got emails from two two of my brothers they picked up on it what was that  pal talk picked up on it uh well listen here it is what made you get involved with it  is is it just something you wanted to do because you wanted to do a charity or is somebody like  close to you affected with it or what made you get involved my grandmother my grandmother i was raised 
[02:35:30]  by her and uh you know she's been very dear and uh you know to my heart and so uh you know once she  got diagnosed with the disease um it was it was pretty much a no-brainer oh no talking about alzheimer's  right oh geez we all heard it we all heard it a no-brainer and of course of course we were all good  boys yeah what are you gonna do yeah but like but like jimmy said you make a crack there then he's  gonna get up and walk the fuck out that's true but we have in the past yeah we have but it was 
[02:36:00]  almost i wasn't there in the past when the guy's talking about his his grandma it's it's hard to  like raise them if it was just the subject itself yeah like if uh he's like look it's a very uh it's a  scary thing but when they asked me just to get involved with that if it was just like that  it would it would have flown out yeah yeah it was a little too personal yeah exactly grammy  just get up and clock you in the face no i don't think he would have please for t.o money i'd take 
[02:36:30]  a shot but now he would have just walked out i would have you know whatever i'm a pussy i'm a cowboy  fan i didn't want to terrell to be mad at me call him terrell everyone else does i mean it's not his  name what he came in he was not happy yeah he didn't yeah he was furious at that like yeah he seemed  really pissed he's tired maybe he heard the crack i made jimmy turned around remember yeah it was  okay maybe he went to the wrong address and i made the crack about all time maybe that was gonna be  all funny though that's really funny see those diamond earrings he had on those things gotta be  fucking five dollars they were fake perhaps more than that jim don't hurt him yeah he's

[02:47:00]  gravy-legged bitch dave's calling from under a pile of rubble  the motherfuckers fall because they're crooked  what's that motherfucking crooked cranes be falling and knocking motherfuckers over  job talking jimmy yeah that's right i love job talking jimmy  if you uh if you look across the street they mount the crane to the building every couple  floors yeah with a little collar around the tower uh-huh well so what happens is they're going to put  the the top one on and they slip and the collar slides down and hits the next one 
[02:47:30]  one and then hits the next one hits the next one and it knocks all the collars down to the ground  then thing falls over that's right that's why it says we only tether them with string at the very  top one little piece of string tethering got some hungover construction worker and he uh sneezes and  drops the top collar yeah all right dave thanks for the insight thanks dave thanks a lot jesus 
[02:48:00]  christ right take your collar story and go fuck your mother and it's looking out the window  by the way yeah he's kidding you're looking out the window are we uh in good shape with that crane  over there now we're fucking doomed yeah that thing is definitely i hope it's that thing every day  when we walk every ding dong day you know what uh how come i remember all these cranes being put in  the middle of the new buildings remember they used to build it around the crane and then they'd have  to you know take it apart and this is easier now all the cranes are on the outside of the building

[02:59:30]  Thank you.  I'm kidding.  Come here.  Barely.  Come here.  Her last date was Michael.  Talk to Michael Boddy.  Well, Patty and I have a weird history.  Yeah.  You don't say.  No, but I was the first one to ever touch her breast.  I was the first one to ever touch her breast.  Before her dad?  Come on.  No, she's, Patty's been very, she's a virgin.  She's a virgin.  Of course I am.  Patty is not a virgin.  Yes, I am. 
[03:00:00]  52-year-old virgin.  Are you serious?  Yeah, what about this?  What the fuck are you waiting for?  A crane to fall on your head?  Let's get busy.  No, I don't want to die of AIDS or something.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  Well, don't fuck a Haitian with a needle in his ass.  It's got to be a committed relationship.  What are you going to do about the breast?  What if I gave you something on your breast through the saliva?  That doesn't, it doesn't happen.  Of course it can.  That happened once.  Yes, it did.  That's how I lost my aunt.  You better look it up, Patty.  You better look it up.  It kind of felt good, though, right?  She had nipple AIDS.  It felt weird. 
[03:00:30]  I don't know about good.  I can't decide on that yet, but it felt weird.  Patty, what are you waiting for?  Seriously, you're 52.  I'm waiting for a committed person.  I don't want to be committed.  Committed?  Or do something bad to me.  You know, I get scared.  You don't want to beat you up?  I do.  Who's going to beat you up, Patty?  You know who Steve Freed is?  You know, I don't want a guy that's going to control me or anything like that.  I want to be with somebody that cares about me.  You've been waiting forever.  Guys like that don't exist, for Christ's sake.  I know. 
[03:01:00]  Just put on the lube and get out there.  You're sitting on the bench your whole life.  Let's go.  I want to be with somebody that I could fall in love with.  What kind of guy do you think?  Jesus.  Have you looked at a mirror lately?  Quiet, you know.  Somebody quiet?  So you're looking for, okay, a retarded guy with no dick.  Yeah, because I'm a quiet person.  You're quiet?  Yeah, I am.  You want a shy guy?  You have nice tits and they're going to waste.  I'm not shy, you know, but somebody that I could click with, you know.  I haven't met that person yet. 
[03:01:30]  Sounds like you're on a remote.  No.  You haven't met them because if they're like you, you wouldn't meet them.  Because you don't go out to meet people.  Yeah, Patty, you've got to get out there, man.  That perfect guy for you.  I thought about this.  I don't drink, but I thought about visiting one of the bars in, you know, on the Broadway.  You're going to visit it?  Visit a bar.  Or something like that.  Can we get you a brochure before you go?  You want a drink?  No, I'm just visiting.  You know, a lot of them.  You want to visit a bar?  Well, I don't know where to meet people, really. 
[03:02:00]  It's a great bar in Inwood.  I go to clubs or anything because you have to have a lot of money to get into those.  So I'm very limited in what I can do.  I hear a lot of excuses, Patty.  You know.  That's right.  I think you should get out there.  I'll give you $150 tonight.  You go to the shark bar.  What's a shark bar?  Shark.  Shark.  Shark.  Where is that?  It's on the west side.  It's popular with the brothers.  Yeah.  Brothers?  Brothers, uh...  Yeah, get yourself some, you know... 
[03:02:30]  I don't know.  Why not?  Louisiana Black Snake.  Yeah, why not?  Yeah, I'm saying...  I want to go to a nice place like the Blue Fin or something like that.  The Blue Fin?  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  Blow Jacques Cousteau?  Come on.  Talk to me.  Yeah, but I want somebody that's, you know, that I could talk to, like, about current events  and things going on.  Oh, really?  Who likes the bowl.  Sounds to fuck Mike Wallace now.  You know, once in a blue, blue moon, I like to take a little trip down to Atlantic City and  walk on the board.  What's blue, blue moon, buddy? 
[03:03:00]  Atlantic City.  Atlantic.  All right.  I want to go to a...  Atlantic.  What's blue, blue moon?  Blue, blue moon means once in a long time or once in a neon.  Oh, okay.  By the way, every walk with you is a boardwalk.  Thank you, Anthony.  No problem.  Well, she likes to talk about current events.  What's going on in the news?  Maybe we can...  Yeah.  Yeah, introduce you to some...  Let's see how this would go.  Oh, no.  What do you like about the current events?  Let's talk to somebody with a crane on his neck.  Yeah, it's... 
[03:03:30]  You know, that's because they're too cheap to pay workers' union wages and they hire, like,  lower paid people to...  All union.  And they're not qualified.  They're all fucking union.  They're all union.  All these guys are union.  They're not getting crane operators outside the Home Depot, trust me.  They're getting scabs to fucking set up the cranes around Manhattan.  Right.  Do you know the money they get for operating a crane?  Oh, please.  I know a crane operator.  I'm sure that guy was like, well, at least I'm making a lot of money as he was plummeting  to his desk.  Oh, I know, but the people that are supposed to probably secure them don't. 
[03:04:00]  Right, why?  Kablamo.  Maybe because they're not as qualified.  Right.  Or don't know what they're doing.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I want to see you have this conversation on a loud dance floor.  You know, I can dance and stuff like that.  I know.  Of course you can.  That's what I'm saying.  But, you know.  I just don't want to be with a guy that's going to take advantage of me or hurt me in  any way.  Thank you.  I get scared to death.  What's your favorite dance? 
[03:04:30]  You ever do the Watusi in a shithead?  No.  Could you imagine the first fucking time she's laying there?  And, of course, with a lot of KY.  That first cock that just slides up inside her.  Oh, my God.  I don't want to end up with AIDS.  What would you do?  Banging into the ceiling.  Would you like, oh, AIDS?  Who are you fucking?  What are you?  What are you?  Come on.  What are the odds?  And AIDS takes about 10 years.  Yeah, you'll be dead by the time it kills you.  I want to live till I'm 103.  Oh, really? 
[03:05:00]  103.  Why 103?  I don't know.  I don't want to die early.  Yeah?  104 is what?  You don't want to have AIDS.  That's it for the rest of your life.  And too many very young people have it.  They can never have a normal relationship for the rest of their lives.  Yeah, but they're all like choreographers and shit.  Yeah, you don't got to worry about that.  Two words.  Magic Johnson.  Exactly.  Look at him.  He put on 80 pounds after you get AIDS.  It hasn't stopped him.  Yeah, but I wouldn't go with him because I'd get a black.  Oh, you're a racist.  Oh, you're a racist.  You're a racist?  No, I get HIV also. 
[03:05:30]  No.  Oh, yes, you do.  It went away.  That's why they call him magic.  He's clean as a fucker.  I'm telling you.  You're contagious for the rest of your life.  Yeah.  I don't know.  He's been fucking Isaiah Thomas for like two years.  It doesn't matter.  You're contagious for the rest of your life.  Listen to her.  You can give it to somebody else whether you're doing well or not.  But they keep testing him and it comes back negative.  Yeah.  I'm not making this shit up.  It's there for life.  It might be negative because he doesn't have a flare up at that moment. 
[03:06:00]  A flare up.  A flare up of the AIDS?  Are we talking about a fucking back injury?  Yeah.  A fucking cold sore.  They're not rickets.  No.  Just because of it.  Yeah.  He doesn't have a six pound water blister on the head of his dick.  He's fine.  I just hope to meet a very nice gentleman.  Somebody a little old fashioned who will open the door for me.  Old fashioned.  Do you look at my fucking game comments?  Tesla.  Open the door for you like one of those basement ones when you're walking.  You know someone that'll let me walk on the inside of the sidewalk and he walks on the 
[03:06:30]  outside.  You know.  Is that how it's supposed to be done?  What are you going to fuck?  A crossing guard?  Jacket over the puddle.  Yeah.  Jacket over the puddle.  Yeah.  He wants a knife.  To hide the fucking exposed wiring.  Patty.  You're so funny, Patty.  And you would have sex with a person like this?  After a committed relationship and that we were the only two people together and he wasn't 
[03:07:00]  going to go with the other.  Right, right, right.  All that.  I know you're with the fucking questionnaire.  It's unbelievable.  But you would.  All that stuff is a guarantee.  You would lay there.  I would prefer to also be married to him first and then go.  Oh, no.  You're really fucking stretching it.  Yeah.  You know.  I don't know.  I just have these values.  Yeah.  There's plenty of 50 plus year old women out there just getting married.  She just talks to her.  You do have.  Your standards seem a little high.  I mean.  What if he said this?  What if he said, I'll marry you.  But first, you gotta let me put it in your shitter.  He wouldn't talk to me like that.  He might think you liked her. 
[03:07:30]  Not on the first date.  I love you or something like that.  Oh, would it be great if some guy married her and then he just was the most despicable  fucking pervert?  Yeah.  Just grabbing her by the hand.  I'm going to fuck your mouth.  I'm going to fuck your face.  I'm going to.  You're not going to suck my cock.  I'm going to fuck your face.  Come here, pussy face.  And there's a different bitch and I'm going to show it to you right now.  Yeah.  You are getting your face fucked.  And then he just grabs your hair.  No, he wouldn't.  You'd be like, whoa, whoa.  He looks like Vic Tabak from fucking Alice. 
[03:08:00]  Just choking.  That's why you go out with a person for a long time.  Hold on.  He wears a sailor hat and a fucking tank top.  And his favorite hobbies are fishing, beating immigrants, and mouth fucking.  And you never knew any of it.  And then.  That's how you can know a person who dies in love within six months.  And then he goes ass to mouth with you.  He pounds your asshole.  Yeah.  Pulls it out.  There's slight streaks of brown shit on his dick.  And he fucks your face.  He grabs your mouth. 
[03:08:30]  And you don't want to open your little chicklet teeth.  But he fucking squeezes your cheeks so hard that you got to open it.  And he shoves his cock in your face.  And you taste your own shit.  That's right.  I think he'd be in jail after that.  No, you're married.  It's legal.  It's legal.  You're stuck with the house of horror.  You'd be in the kitchen making him a sandwich after that.  And he calls your ears.  He says, bring the handles closer.  And he grabs your ears like handles.  And he holds on.  Like he's doing dips at the gym. 
[03:09:00]  The guy that I am duck with will never hurt me.  He would be my companion.  That's not hurting.  That's romantic.  Patty, this guy doesn't exist.  He's fucking romantic.  Sure they do.  Well, he did, but he died yesterday.  I want to get Roland's opinion on Stalker Patty.  What do you think, Roland?  You've been hearing this horse shit for a while now.  Seriously, it's horse shit.  I don't know.  She's delusional with that.  I mean, there's no dude like that.  What is Roland having a few values?  I don't know.  You're 52 and that shit's drying up like a dog shit on my lawn in August. 
[03:09:30]  It's not really 53 in five days.  Really?  Oh, in a few days.  So maybe you can get one in before next Friday.  You want to squeeze my penis?  No.  It's kind of hard.  No.  Patty, just squeeze his penis.  I'm not fooling you.  I'm not fooling you.  You're my fucking love connection.  Patty, what the fuck?  Through the pants.  I know.  Just to be a silly goose.  It's my birthday.  You and Jimmy have a thing.  You know that.  You can't get aced through jeans.  Oh, shit.  I forgot she had a little bit.  She knows your goddamn birthday.  Yeah, she's a psycho.  Daddy, hold the microphone for poor Patty.  Patty, you know you want to do it.  Just give it a little squeeze. 
[03:10:00]  Not too hard.  I'll teach you how to squeeze the penis.  He's through the jeans.  I'll teach you how to squeeze a penis.  Come on.  Come on.  I'll teach you how to squeeze a penis, as we say.  Yeah.  Think back to Thanksgiving when you were six at the kids table.  Go ahead, Patty.  Get in there.  I know.  That's the beauty.  You're married.  I'm Vic Tabak.  I come home.  I've spent the whole day at the fish hatchery.  I smell the showers broken.  Vic Tabak.  He's got a blood-stained apron on.  Yes.  What Vic Tabak's job is, is I have to remove the vaginas from all the salmon at the fish 
[03:10:30]  hatchery and throw them into a pile.  It's a weird job, but I'm the man who does it.  So I'm dirty and disgusting.  And I just want my Peter squeezed when I walk in the door.  All right.  Squeeze his Peter.  It sounds like an idea for a pilot.  Yes.  Come on, Patty.  Get in there and squeeze.  Come on, before it gets totally soft.  I don't even know where it is.  Yes, you do.  It's right below his chin.  Yes.  Give it a squeeze.  I think you see where it is.  I know, just gently.  Don't do it too hard.  Not too hard.  Don't do it like it's a boomerang.  Just get in there and squeeze his Peter. 
[03:11:00]  Okay, give it a squeeze.  Go ahead.  Easy.  Daris.  I know, me too.  Believe me.  Oh, Danny, could you go around the other side of her so that I'll talk people can do it?  Just pretend you're at the supermarket and pick on cucumbers.  Patty, my dick is running for the hills.  Go ahead.  Squeeze his Peter.  Come on, Patty.  It's right there.  Get in there.  Just give it a little.  Get in my jeans.  And don't just touch it and move it away.  Give it a good honk.  Give it a good honk.  One, two.  Don't.  Go ahead.  You can do it.  Go ahead, baby.  Grab it.  She really wants to. 
[03:11:30]  That's the date I had in college.  She really wants to.  Just gently.  It's not a pit bull, for Christ's sake.  Pet it.  Now, you touched it with your pointer finger and thumb.  Yeah, you just pinched it.  Much the way a coroner picks up evidence.  How about you touch it with your whole hand?  Look how excited Patty gets.  My whole hand.  Look at her.  Patty.  It's a dick.  You don't pick it up like that.  Patty, grab it.  So bad.  Patty, just grab it with your whole hand, the palm of your hand, and squeeze it a little  bit.  That's all.  Oh, you're not going to.  Come on. 
[03:12:00]  What am I going to do?  Oh, my God.  She thinks he's going to cum.  She thinks he's going to fucking cum.  Your tits not that nice.  Jesus.  She has the subtle touch.  She grabbed it the way you grab a fucking banister when you're falling.  Patty.  Patty.  A little decorum.  Get in there.  Leave your hand there a little while.  She grabbed half the head and half thin air.  Yeah.  So she pinched the helmet.  Patty.  You've got to grab the chef gently.  Not hard.  Just grab it.  Give it a shake a little.  Roland, show her how to do it. 
[03:12:30]  Show me with your mouth.  Rub it.  Rub it.  Get in there, Patty.  Rub it.  Not hard.  Just soft.  This is so weird.  I know.  Let's be honest.  You are weird, too.  No, don't squeeze it like that.  I don't know how to do it.  It's not a spider you're throwing out.  Just rub it like that.  Yeah, just rub it, Patty.  There you go.  It wasn't enough.  Shoot it like that.  Trust me.  I've more than met the expectations.  No, you haven't.  I want to come in.  I've exceeded expectations.  Just rub it like that.  Go ahead, Patty.  Go ahead, Patty.  Get in there, Patty.  Like this? 
[03:13:00]  Rub it nice.  Yeah, just rub it.  Rub it nice.  Spock.  Now with your fingers separated like that.  Spock.  She had her fucking Vulcan fingers open.  She was skimming you the spot.  It's awful.  It's like being jerked off by James Colbert.  His big fucking athletic foot.  Oh, my God.  She has fucking hands like the Starbucks cup mermaid.  I feel like I'm going to pass out.  You feel like you're going to pass out?  Just rub it, Patty.  Just rub it.  Rub it like it's a little agabadoosha.  Get in there.  You're doing a fine job yourself.  I know.  I'm trying to teach you. 
[03:13:30]  Come on, rub it.  A genie's going to come out of it.  Like that?  Yeah.  Keep rubbing.  Patting it like a dog's head.  She did it like five seconds.  Yeah.  She just rolled in her hands.  That's nice.  What are you making?  Cinnabons?  You need a rolling pin.  I'm not getting hard.  I'm getting the reverse of hard.  My guess is actually inverted running up into my asshole.  I'm probably four and a half, five goals.  Yeah, Patty, pull down your pants.  He's going to rest his penis on your backside.  He's just going to rest it on your backside.  He's just going to rest it on your ass crack.  Patty, put some tabasco on it. 
[03:14:00]  No, Jimmy's not.  Put some tabasco.  No, Jimmy's not.  No, I think I've exceeded expectations.  You don't want him leaking a little clear stuff down your ass crack?  I'll jump in here, too.  No.  I'm not resting my penis on her.  You gave it a squeeze through the jeans, and now I have to tinkle.  That's why it's soft.  It wasn't your magical touch.  Yeah.  It was the fact that I had to tinkle.  Patty, how about he leaks a little clear stuff down your ass crack?  No, he doesn't.  Yeah, just look at it.  She's petrified of the clear stuff. 
[03:14:30]  Jesus Christ.  I couldn't even watch it.  No.  Come here.  Come here.  We're going to put a little on your lips.  Patty, how about he just jacks off on your ass?  No.  Shoots a load of hot cum in your ass crack.  No, Anthony.  No?  How about this?  If I just hold your butthole open and make a wee-wee.  No.  No.  I did enough.  Patty, how about this?  It's like water in a plant.  Patty, just hear yourself.  Hear Jimmy up.  How about this?  You and I pretend we're in a race, and you're in front of me about to grab the leaky baton. 
[03:15:00]  But I run too far, and it gets stuck between your butt cheeks, and we spin in a circle,  and we make jokes.  No.  Why not?  Not think this.  All right.  Okay, Patty, how about this?  I'm sorry.  How about this?  Get in and go.  You gently just put your mouth over his cock.  No.  Come on.  Oh, God, no.  Until he shoots a wad in your mouth.  No.  How about this?  I don't shoot the wad.  A big, thick, viscous wad.  No.  How about you just hold the head, and you go...  Like a gerbil, like when they want some water in the fucking tank. 
[03:15:30]  No.  Denny, he'll tell you when he's going to come.  Yeah.  No, here's the deal.  I'll just...  Okay, I'll go as far as this.  I'll touch it for real, you know, that...  Without any pants.  Yeah, I'll do that.  No, you won't.  But you can't have contact with me.  No, you won't.  No, just through my pants.  I won't let you touch it, Bear.  All right.  Wow.  I don't want to be physically touched.  Close the doors.  I think we got something going on here.  Close the doors.  Let's lock Patty in studio.  And rape her.  Can I get out before you close it? 
[03:16:00]  No, I'm not going to tape my pants.  Of course not.  Why would you?  No.  You know, I wouldn't do that.  I can't let you do that to me.  Patty, would you let a guy come on your tits?  No.  Ever?  No.  Even like this magic man that you're married to that...  No.  I guess the shit is out now.  How about this?  I'm sorry.  I want to be a lady.  Too late for that.  What if he's fucking you, right?  Mm-hmm.  And he pulls out and just comes on your belly?  Is that okay?  No, I don't want that on me.  You want it in you?  You want it in you then? 
[03:16:30]  No.  Then what's going to happen with it?  You want to be 52 and pregnant?  No.  You don't want to use a rubber.  I don't want to do that.  I'm sorry.  A rubber with your husband?  No.  After you're through menopause and you can't get fucking pregnant?  Where do you use some KY to lube up that fucking old well?  We're not married.  Okay.  And then, no, you're married.  No, we're not.  He's pumping away with his gray ass hair fucking glistening in the nightlight.  His face is in your neck.  He's saying different names.  Tell us a good story. 
[03:17:00]  I can't let him have this.  I can't do that.  I'm sorry.  Where is he coming?  What's he supposed to do?  Where is he going to orgasm?  Shooter on a coffee table?  I can't do that.  Patty, where do you want him to come?  Where do you want him to orgasm?  Where is it going to go?  In a napkin or something.  In a napkin?  What the fuck?  Where are you going to find this guy?  At IHOP.  I'm sorry.  There's enough.  There's single men out there.  That are willing to fuck you and come in a napkin? 
[03:17:30]  Are you out of your mind?  With somebody you're in love with who cares about you.  But that's what I'm saying.  This is the guy that cares about you.  Who puts this shit in women's heads?  Unbelievable.  Who puts this in these girls' heads?  All right.  So six months he can come inside you?  If we're going steady for six months.  Steady.  Going steady?  Who the fuck are you, Sandra Dee?  Who the fuck are you, Dave Potsy?  Fucking Sandra Dee.  What, are you going to be wearing his letter jacket?  Wait, fair enough now.  Patty has said that it's...  Well, wait till we get pinned.  If you were the guy for six months and you were both in love, 
[03:18:00]  and you're monogamous...  Dr. Norton.  Yeah.  And he wanted to...  If, say, Vic climbed on and he was inside of you...  Vic...  I would be someone I was extremely in love with.  Hold on, baby.  Do you like Vic Taylor?  Your orgasm was coming.  And he said, like, in a pirate voice,  Wrap your legs around me back.  Because that's how he talks when he comes for no reason.  Between couples that are familiar with little fantasy and role-playing and stuff. 
[03:18:30]  That's kind of fun.  What kind of fantasy are you all playing?  You know, just like...  You can make believe you're a woman.  You know, like fantasy type.  Well, Patty, what kind?  Give us help.  Okay.  Fucking murderer.  I'm with the guy for a long time, and he comes home...  Are you going to use that tone of voice, the whole relationship?  ...and I would have a uniform on like a maid,  and I would have nothing on underneath.  Well, most people don't have anything underneath the uniform.  What do you think?  They put on a uniform over a prom dress?  Yeah, I would...  You're going to be dressed like a maid? 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, or dressed like a Playboy Bunny or something.  No, you're going to stick with maid.  I can see maid.  Hold on.  Playboy Bunny might be sexy.  Let's get some sexy outfits for Patty to try on.  Playboy Bunny with the little ears.  Yeah.  A little French maid, maybe, too.  A little French maid outfit, sure.  Maybe.  I'm trying to figure out the maid.  You should dress like the rabbit in Fatal Attraction.  But it would be a relationship.  Would you put on a strap-on?  Would you put on a belt with a penis?  Oh, my God.  Because I don't go that way.  How do you feel about Devo hats? 
[03:19:30]  Listen, you know what?  God damn it.  Opie asked a brilliant question.  What if your husband, Vic, or your boyfriend, who you were in love with,  when you were kissing...  This Vic is something.  If he said Patty...  I need to get popped in the shitter.  If he said...  I need to get popped in the shitter.  And you said, what do you mean, Vic?  And he said it was something that Flo would do to him at the diner.  He liked to be entered.  If he said, I need you to enter me.  And he had, like, a special strap-on belt. 
[03:20:00]  And he just wanted to put his big Greek man legs on your shoulders.  And have you fucking...  Treat his asshole like you're fucking drilling for oil.  I mean, I'm trying to say this nicely.  Yeah.  What, would you do it?  Yeah.  This is...  And before you put it in, he goes spitting it.  Yeah.  How long do you have to go steady before you would pop another guy,  another guy, a guy in the shitter.  A guy in the shitter.  Make that strap-on look like a collapsing crane. 
[03:20:30]  Six months minimum.  Six months.  Just leave a wreck on his ass.  Wait, six months, and you might pop your steady in the shitter.  Six months to get to know the person.  All right, so she might do that, Jimmy.  That gives you six months to get to.  So would it go from just talking to, on six months later,  you're fucking him in the ass with a dildo?  Or do you, like, slowly start with stories about, you know,  getting a little sexy?  Do you get sexy talk?  Do you do sexy texts?  What do you do? 
[03:21:00]  All right, Patty, take your...  I'm happy we get sexy texts with me or I love you or sweet love letters.  Love letters, but what about the dirty talk?  All right, Patty, take your jeans off.  Patty, your date is here.  There it is.  Patty, take your jeans off.  Seriously.  Yeah.  Why?  We're going to show you how to put this on.  It's not going in you.  We're not going to do it.  Don't worry.  It sticks out.  It's not going to burn you.  It's brand new.  Take off your jeans.  It's a strap-on.  Just take your jeans off.  It doesn't go in you.  Have we ever hurt you in studio?  Patty, it straps on.  You don't know a strap-on when you see it. 
[03:21:30]  It straps on you.  She thinks it's a hat.  I know.  No, it's okay.  You don't have to be.  We're doing it as a goof.  You don't have to be.  You'll fuck a guy with it.  Relax, Patty.  Get your XM panties.  Nice.  Get your fucking panties on.  Fucking nice.  All right, look at that.  There you go.  All right, drop the jeans.  Could you take the jeans off, please?  Lose the jeans.  You look like you're fucking getting an exam.  Yeah.  Let's sexy this up a little bit.  She's got fucking XM underwear on.  She's a body like Iggy Pop.  They happen to be clean.  We know.  Oh, wow.  Fucking satellite underwear.  What the fuck? 
[03:22:00]  That's her selling point.  They happen to be clean.  Step out of your jeans, Patty, please.  Patty, please.  We don't want you to trip and fall and fucking break your head.  Well, we do, but.  Yeah, we can get in trouble.  We can get in trouble for it, so.  Patty.  Do you know how that straps on?  What?  No.  I've never worn it.  Not you, Danny.  I'm trying to figure this out.  Yeah.  It's a wacky contraption.  Where's fucking stupid Dave?  He would know.  Is he side Dave here?  Yeah, he would know.  Of course Sam knows.  Sam.  Dave wouldn't know.  He just knows what it feels like from behind. 
[03:22:30]  Patty.  Maybe you do.  Don't put this on YouTube or anything.  We're not going to put it on YouTube.  Come on, Patty.  They wouldn't do that to you.  You're crazy.  They wouldn't do that, Patty.  We'll put her on ABC at 8 o'clock on a Wednesday.  Yeah.  Those are really nice doily socks.  Jesus Christ, Patty.  What the fuck?  Look how long it takes to get her pants off.  It looks like she's wearing those things that chicks put on their feet when they're trying  on shoes at the shoe store.  That's why she's wearing a sock.  Yeah.  You're not supposed to take those with you.  They're horrible.  You're supposed to give them back after you try on shoes. 
[03:23:00]  Not for nothing, though.  For 52, she ain't that, you know.  She's not bad at all.  She's hanging in here, Jimmy.  She certainly is.  I've seen a lot of dents on younger bros.  All right.  Let's go.  Let's step into the Patty nose.  Patty, now around your forehead.  There you go.  Go to that.  Step in.  Can someone show Patty how to put on the fucking strap-on?  The strap-on dildo.  Step with your left leg into that one, and then we'll try to buckle the strap.  I hope she falls over.  It bangs her head with a strap-on.  It falls over, and it goes up her pussy.  I saw this at a fucking... 
[03:23:30]  It's ugly.  It's ugly.  That was actually the dildo talking.  Wait, Patty, we're strapping the dildo on you.  What's wrong with you?  Oh, shit.  Come on, Patty.  All right.  What the fuck are you just carrying?  Ew.  That's just yucky.  What?  Now it looks like...  Is that why they call it the hot seat?  Well, that's...  Yeah.  All right.  It's being strapped on.  Now, Patty, like, fuck around with it a little. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah.  Play with it like you had a cock.  Hold it in your hand.  Yeah, hold it in your hand.  There you go.  There you go.  A few people have used that before, so just don't get shit on your fingers.  Patty, look.  You got a dick.  What do you think?  I don't like it.  No, leave it on.  Leave it on.  Leave it on.  Just stand there with a cock for a while.  That's right.  Now grab it.  Is she allowed to walk around the block like that?  Grab it and wave it, like, angrily.  Yeah, like, eh?  Act like a guy.  Hold your penis and say something like that.  Hold your penis.  Talk like a guy, though. 
[03:24:30]  Talk like a guy and grab your cock.  Grab your cock and talk like a guy.  Let's go.  What would you say?  Grab that cock and say something.  Say, thank you, eHarmony.  Yeah, I wanted to join Lava Life, but I don't know how to upload my picture.  Lava Life?  Lava Life?  I don't know how to take my picture from MySpace and put it onto there.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Well, I'll help you with Lava Life.  Can we get Patty to walk around the block with the strap on?  No, I will not.  Come on, Patty.  No, because people know me. 
[03:25:00]  What's it to you?  Who knows you?  Who?  Not outside.  No.  The crane operator's dead.  No.  She's a sexy way of saying no.  People know me.  Yeah, that voice is turning me on.  Who knows you?  Besides Rush fans.  People from Starbucks will be out there, and I've worked in their stores before.  No.  What are you hunching over for?  This looks like an army physical.  No.  Patty's going to walk into her own Starbucks with that on.  Yes.  That's some cock you're supporting there, Patty.  Patty, I'll buy you.  That's some cock you're supporting.  This is a...  Let me tell you.  It's a miracle I went this far. 
[03:25:30]  I wouldn't classify it as a miracle.  Yeah, a miracle.  Fucking miracle.  She's comparing this with walking on water, wearing a rubber dick.  He turned fucking one loaf into a thousand loaves, and Dumbbella put on a fake penis.  Dumbbella.  Patty.  It feels weird.  What?  What?  It feels weird having a cock?  How do you think it looks...  Put it in here.  What do you think it looks like when a guy jerks off?  Go ahead.  Do that.  Yeah, show us a guy jerking off.  Show us what a guy looks like jerking off.  Show us a girl. 
[03:26:00]  Well, I see it on Paltalk sometimes.  I've got into the...  Not with your camera, but you're at some point.  Yeah, guaranteed they've never seen you.  She thinks they're jerking off, but their fingers are down their throat.  They go like that, and they go like that, and they go like that, and they go like that.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Start over, because that was amazing.  Do it again.  Do it again.  Do it again.  I see them do this, and do this, and do this, and do that.  Patty's demonstrating how guys jerk off on Paltalk.  One more time.  Don't do it.  Like this, and then like this, and like this, and then like that, and then they stop and 
[03:26:30]  go like that, and then they go like that.  Hold on.  And at that point, I go click.  What happened?  You ever see somebody do the money shot and come?  No, they don't do that.  I don't see that on Paltalk.  She was moving like the fucking guy dancing in The Godfather.  I even saw one guy do this.  Like that, and then snap it back, and then I clicked off right there.  Hey, do we have any fake pussies in the office?  Yeah.  All right, get a pussie. 
[03:27:00]  All right, get a fake pussy.  We're going to have Patty have sex with him.  Let's see Patty's fucking style.  Yeah, we want to see how you have sex.  We'll get a fake pussy.  That's right.  You'll lube that up, and you're going to fuck the fake pussy with your fake cock.  Here's what we'll do with the fake pussy.  I'll put it over my ass cheeks.  Right.  You're crazy.  No, not again.  Would you really?  Why not?  Oh, that would be awesome.  You can act like you're giving...  All right, we got to sleep.  All right.  We need the big fake pussy.  Where's the big fake ass?  What the fuck is that?  Who the fuck brought the...  That's a pink sock.  What is that?  A fucking hairy queen?  Who the fuck took our fake pussy home? 
[03:27:30]  It looks like Qbert.  What the fuck is that?  It's Qbert's nose.  What the fuck is that?  More importantly, someone took the fake pussy home.  I have it on my desk.  I put pens in it.  What's up, Danny?  It's like a fucking Great Dane's pussy.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Jimmy, would you put that on your ass, I guess?  No.  Is that a tasty freeze?  Well, you know what we could do?  We could, like, duct tape it to the console so it doesn't move around.  All right.  That sounds good.  And then give it a good fuck in there, Pat.  Wait, do we have, like, a Playboy centerfold or something?  We've got to have some kind of, you know, stimulant. 
[03:28:00]  Do we have a large cardboard cutout of a wrestler?  All right, Patty's got the strap-on on.  I've got to pee real quick.  I'll be right back.  Oh, wow.  You've got to jerk off.  You've got to do something silly in there.  All right, how about a quick break as we set up for Stalker Patty's first fucking?  Yeah, that's good.  I mean, Stalker Patty wearing the strap-on will be fucking a fake pussy.  It's a long day of radio.  You guys are underpaid.  Oh, yeah.  I really want to get a fucking...  Fucking genius, this stuff.  I'm so tired.  Fucking despicable human beings we are.  All right, make a fake woman and we'll be back. 
[03:28:30]  But it is something funny.  Hi, I'm Casey Kasem.  This letter comes in from Kathy in Oklahoma.  She writes, Dear Casey, I like getting fucked in my anus and in my cunt.  Could you play anal cunt for my boyfriend?  I also go ass to mouth.  Well, we'll get that right on for you.  Here's anal cunt on American Top Word.  Okay, Anthony.  Ah, we got another good one in progress. 
[03:29:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  I want to thank Nick DiPaolo for stopping by.  NickDip.com for his comedy days.  But more importantly, tonight, one night only, two shows.  Caroline's here in New York City.  There you go.  Thank you.  You're quite welcome there, Nick.  Thank you for having me.  You're very nice.  I'm not leaving, are you?  I'm not going nowhere.  Patty's going to poke me in the fucking pussy ball.  Yeah, I don't know how we got to this point, but basically, we got Stalker Patty in studio.  She has a strap-on dildo on.  Jimmy has agreed to let Patty fuck the fake pussy that Jimmy's going to have between his ass cheeks. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, I'm going to hold it with my boxers on, because it's all sticky with tape.  And it's going to kind of feel, it looks like a proboscis.  And I'm going to hold it between my legs, which is going to poke out.  I'm going to look like a fucking, a chimp.  Have you ever seen a chimp pussy with that big red?  It already looks like you've been pink-socked.  Yeah, it looks like I'm already coming off a fucking hard night.  I saw this on Leave It to Beaver. 
[03:30:00]  Jimmy, it's the lost episodes.  Jimmy, could you put the thing between your legs just to see how it's going to look?  Yeah, let's see what it's going to look like.  Let me keep my jeans on.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  I got the motherfuckers.  I'm going to keep my motherfucking boxers on.  Jimmy has boxers on.  All right, Jimmy's falling down his boxers.  All right, always.  He's adjusting his dick, man.  All right, you're getting a big laugh.  Turn around, Jimmy.  I want to see how this looks.  Oh, my God.  Anthony, here it is.  That's what Patty's going to be, that's what Patty's going to have sex with. 
[03:30:30]  You know what this bit needs?  One more thing.  Yeah?  A real cock.  I mean, no, he slipped.  The listener's in studio for this bit.  Come on, yes.  Let's get the, we got a nice crowd.  Get the bleachers in here.  The crowd has been growing all morning long.  We got at least 20 people out there.  We're going to quickly bring the bleachers in, and then Stalker Patty's going to start  Jimmy.  Start her a fucking.  I won't really take.  What?  What's wrong?  Is this a bad time to talk about the presidential election coming up? 
[03:31:00]  Not at all.  It's what Hillary's doing to the Democratic Party.  Oh.  Get it.  She's talking to me.  I tie it all into Hillary.  All fucking sticks and butter legs.  All right, the bleachers are in studio, and the fans are filing in.  Get a good seat.  Come on in, guys.  Just like Wrigley feel, huh?  Yeah.  That's right.  This is like a Rockwell.  All right, Patty.  All right, Patty, stand up. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  Now let's put my vagina in.  All right, Jimmy's going to put his vagina in.  You bet Jimmy is.  How many times have we heard that in the last two weeks?  All right, now, can you guys get a good view?  Wait, get a mic in front of these guys.  They get a mic in front of them?  There's the best camera for this one.  Holy shit.  What a mess this is.  I'm getting queasy.  And Mrs. Voorhees is having fun?  All right.  All right.  All right, Jimmy.  Wait, I got to get a...  I'm going to go to one.  Hold on.  Just, Patty, don't get lube all over my underpants. 
[03:32:00]  Wait, are we lubing up the cock or the fake pussy?  I say you lube.  What do you think, guys?  I don't know.  Ask the audience members.  Yeah.  I'm sorry, Danny.  We have to go to the other side again.  Yeah, you vote for what you think.  All right.  Sorry.  All right.  Yeah, the audience.  It's audience participation Friday.  So should we lube up the fake pussy that Jimmy has between his ass cheeks?  Oh, I would say it has to be.  Jimmy is now bending over.  This is going to be on the Food Network. 
[03:32:30]  This is horrific.  This is horrible.  Jimmy's all the way bent over.  He's got his boxes on.  Jimmy's CD covers.  Now, Patty, I'm bent over.  My vagina is...  She's fucking mesmerized.  Patty, what are you thinking?  Get a mic on Patty.  It's called presenting, by the way.  You're presenting.  All right.  Jimmy is certainly presenting.  Hold on.  Let me make sure it's nice and snug, Patty.  I'd hate to have you think I was a loose girl.  Fucking size queen. 
[03:33:00]  That's right, Patty.  Is it nice and tight, Jimmy?  Yeah, I'm clenching my legs in an attempt to say no.  Let's just put that in that.  Yeah.  We'll let Patty lube up her own cock.  Patty will lube up her own cock.  This is actually educational.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Patty, lube up your own cock.  It's brand new lube, so you don't have to worry about nothing.  That's right, Patty.  All right.  Hey, Patty.  Patty's putting some lube on her left hand.  Even if I say no, I mean yes.  Patty is lubeing up her cock.  Lube it up good.  Yeah, lube it up.  Jerk it a little bit. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah, Patty.  Get it all around.  All right.  What are you doing?  This is going to hurt.  See how unsexy that is?  Do you love me?  All right.  Do you have the tissue?  Exactly.  A tissue.  A tissue.  Could you say something unsexy?  No, you're going to be coming into the tissue.  Correct.  It's amazing the thing she comes out with during a sexual moment.  Hey, do you got any sandpaper and a Yankee hat?  Patty, please.  I'm presenting. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah.  My pink fat lips.  Hold on.  Hold on, Patty.  Hold on, Patty.  You've got to wait for the thing to move.  Jesus Christ, Patty.  Hold on.  She goes, where does it go in here?  How many options are there, Patty?  It's either there or you're going to fuck my shoes.  Jimmy, your pussy's drooping a little bit.  My pussy does droop up.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Jimmy's pussy's drooping a little bit.  Whatever it's warm, my vagina gets crooked.  Should we go sideways so the listeners can see this or?  The listeners can see it.  Patty, Patty, the vein goes underneath.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  So Jimmy's hoisting his fake pussy up in the air. 
[03:34:30]  She's putting it in sideways.  Come on, Patty.  I'm clenching my butt cheeks.  No.  Wait, Patty.  You just don't put it in.  Say something sexy.  Let's go on, Patty.  Romantic.  Make me feel like I'm a lady.  Jimmy's bent over the console.  Patty's behind him.  Focus.  Dick in hand.  Act like a guy for us.  Shit, I'm not in this show.  Am I?  It's a little hard.  Yes, it is.  Yeah, okay.  You sound like me.  Fuck.  All right.  Think. 
[03:35:00]  Talk like you think a guy would talk.  Okay, sweet baby cakes.  Here they go.  Holy shit.  Are you doing Elliot Spitzer?  Okay, sweet baby cakes.  Sweet baby cakes.  Here they go.  What?  Fucking Harlem Globetrotters theme songs.  In Long Island.  You can do better than that, Patty.  Come on, Patty.  What are you doing?  I'm going to stick it in.  Come on, Patty.  Oh, I've been going out with you for a long time.  Yes, you have.  Oh, God damn.  She's got to establish a fucking relationship.  Even in dirty talk, she has to get the commitment. 
[03:35:30]  Let's go through the whole role play.  There was traffic on the Long Island Expressway.  I'm going to bottom out in your seat.  Oh!  Bottom out in your seat.  Wow.  Where'd you learn that?  Sesame Street?  What the fuck?  Come on, Patty.  All right, Patty.  Talk dirty to it.  Let Jimmy and Patty talk a little bit.  Patty, go ahead.  Talk to me.  Tell me that you love me and what you're going to do to me.  I love you and I'm going to have sex with you. 
[03:36:00]  I'm going to bottom out in your seat.  I don't know what seat means, Patty.  Let's talk.  Patty, we're a couple.  We don't use language like that.  All right, well, let's just try to pretend you're Vic.  Yeah.  I'm Patty.  Yeah.  I'm going to bottom out in your dippity-do.  What, in an old lady's hair product?  What's a dippity-do?  That's what I had to do when I swallowed one of my replacement teeth.  I had to dip my fingers in dew. 
[03:36:30]  Nothing on that one?  Sorry, I'm Patty, not Jim.  Jim would have had a good one.  I don't.  All right, Patty, let's go.  Let's get his headphones on.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Patty.  Patty's getting all sexy.  Oh, go slow.  Patty, it's radio, so you've got to explain what's going on.  Go slow.  I got it inside the big city.  Go slow.  I'm a lady.  Patty, call it a pussy.  Say, like, talk dirty. 
[03:37:00]  Say, now I'm going to fuck your pussy.  Now I'm going to F your pee.  What does that mean?  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ.  What does that mean?  What does that mean?  Finish my pee.  What does that mean?  Finish your pee.  F my pee.  All right.  Oh, ow.  Is it in?  Yeah, it is.  All right, fuck them.  Good.  Go back and forth.  Treat me like a lady.  Go in and out, Patty.  I am.  No, you're not.  You said you were going to bottom out.  You only got the tip in.  Come on.  Yeah.  Grab his hips and pull him in towards you. 
[03:37:30]  This is like this old house.  Like, fuck him.  Like that.  Now his hips.  Grab his hips and fuck him, for God's sake.  Not my spine.  What's the matter with you?  You're fucking my leg, Patty.  Hey, fucking Lassie, you're humping my leg.  I'm a tiptoer.  What can I say?  You're a tiptoer?  Tiptoer?  What's that mean?  I tiptoe through the tulips.  Yes, you should.  Another 40-year-old reference.  Oh, it's awful.  Jesus Christ.  Tiny Tim fucking reference.  She's just tiptoed through a fucking, an IED field and fucking set it up. 
[03:38:00]  That movie kind of love.  All right, I know.  Just put it in.  Send me.  Please just fuck me.  You send me?  Come on, hurt me.  Out the window.  Put it in.  You can't go in any further.  Yes, you can, Ricky.  Bottom out.  This is like Yankee Workshop.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Patty, pull out and shove back in.  And repeat.  Hold my hips.  There you go.  Hold his hips.  That's right.  Not his back, his hips.  You're not.  Hold him by the hips.  Fuck him.  What are you doing?  Fuck me.  You are one lousy fuck. 
[03:38:30]  All right.  She's doing all right.  She's not.  No, she's bottoming out and you see.  Go ahead.  She's got to hold the penis.  Hold on.  Let me reach under there and hold the vagina snug.  Yeah.  All right.  Jimmy's holding the vagina snug.  Patty, you hold.  Go ahead.  Push it in.  Are you enjoying this, Jimmy?  I'm Patty.  Yes, I'm enjoying it.  Make me feel like a lady.  My lips are chapped.  All right.  I think we're on our set of 20.  Twins by now.  Can I? 
[03:39:00]  Oh, my God.  Patty, you didn't come yet.  You don't say all righty.  I've been doing it for 10 hours.  Patty, talk dirty.  I know.  Well, at least she's got improv skills.  Talk about how you're going to fucking come and stuff.  Patty, come on.  You're going to go to outer space to a world that no one's been walking on before.  Very smooth.  That's some great sex talk.  Seriously.  That's really good.  Out of space to a world she's giving.  I'm trying, though.  The beginning fucking dialogue from Star Trek she's giving.  Fucking Bill Curtis says sexier things on his show.  Bill Curtis. 
[03:39:30]  On the night of November 9th.  Yeah, I'm being such a good story.  The forensic files.  I used to help me on my trip to Atlantic City next week.  I'm dating.  Oh, that's good.  Atlantic City.  Atlantic City.  Atlantic City.  How does it feel to have sex with a pussy there?  I remember seeing the diving horse off the steel pier.  I want to fart so badly.  Somebody did the lindy.  I'm trying to push a fart out.  I only have a be that you do with this rough with me.  This rough?  You fucking haven't even broken my cherry yet. 
[03:40:00]  You're fucking jabbing my cherry like it's a fucking spider web.  It's still standing.  Put the cock in farther.  Make me fucking submit.  I can't do it any further.  Yes, you can.  Push it in, you little silly goose.  Jimmy, screw farting.  I'm going to splatter all over.  Dude, I don't care.  Right now, I'm so fucking...  You don't have no idea.  Talk to me.  Teach me a lesson so I can fucking force out.  Why didn't I take my demucil?  Talk to you.  Why did she spank you?  I teach you a lesson. 
[03:40:30]  I learned you well.  Talk about how you're going to cum.  Talk about what school you're going to send your kids to.  Spank me.  Let Nick show you.  Nick, get back.  I'm going to...  Yeah?  Okay.  I just came.  No, no.  I'm going to...  I can tell by the tone of your voice.  No, that was unsexy, Patty.  Talk to me.  Spank me.  Fucking make me want it.  You want it.  You want it.  Easy now.  You might break something.  Oh, God.  Good one.  Build up to an orgasm, Patty. 
[03:41:00]  Build up like a...  You know you want it.  You've heard...  You've seen porn?  You've seen.  Yeah, you've seen it.  Build up to the orgasm.  And shoots a load?  Come on.  Put it in me.  I turn the channel too soon.  Of course you do.  You do not.  Come on.  I can't watch channels.  All right.  All right.  Make like you're shooting a load in them now.  Yeah.  I just...  Oh, I just...  Wow.  What the hell is that?  That's so good.  Did you come or just take a shit?  What was it?  It's like on a roller coaster.  Oh!  She's riding a cyclone. 
[03:41:30]  Happy breathing.  You know, Patty, this was just as important for me as it was for you.  You think this is an accident, Patty, that I'm taking one near my shitter?  I'm giving it a shot.  I've been dumped in my relationship.  I'm giving it a shot.  I might like this.  It's 39.  It's time for a change.  It'll be a whole new dimension on the Opie and Anthony show.  Okay.  Oh, shit.  All righty.  Well, all righty. 
[03:42:00]  Shouldn't it be over by now?  Yes.  Your life?  Yes.  All righty.  I got a note from Governor Patterson.  I can't get it on.  All righty.  Just...  Oh!  What happened?  What happened?  A clitorectomy.  Oh!  My pants came down.  What happened?  Patty's taking the dildo off the strap-on.  It looks weird.  And it just...  The dildo...  I mean, the fake pussy just flew off of it. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah.  Like, snapped off of it.  Oh, my God.  It feels like real skin.  Yeah, that would be...  What do you think it's going to feel like?  Oh, you like that, don't you?  It's a fucking cylindrical piece of metal?  It at least feels like it's plastic.  That feels real.  Oh, feel that, then.  Feel that.  Yeah, feel it.  Wrap your hand around it.  Yeah.  Wrap it around your hand.  No, I have to...  That's the whole idea, Patty.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now suck on that thing.  No.  Oh, Anthony, stop.  Oh, that's where she draws the line.  Yeah.  No.  Oh, fuck Jimmy and a fake pussy, but...  I just simulated it. 
[03:43:00]  Fucking ass-fucking for now, but I'm not going to put that in my mouth.  You're not a virgin anymore.  How does that feel?  Well, if I was a guy, I wouldn't be a virgin anymore.  Well, wait till your fucking future boyfriend finds out you did this in front of a bunch  of people.  Yeah, that's right.  It's going to be hard to find a nice guy now.  You fucking whore.  It would have to be somebody that...  Oh, my God.  This is where the emotional abuse comes to shit.  Now we've just got to pound it with some emotional abuse.  Holy shit, I'm witnessing a felony here.  This is unbelievable.  That was kind of fun.  Why not? 
[03:43:30]  Sexy.  Well, uh...  That was.  That was like watching the Iron Chef.  I want to thank 5-Hour Energy for sponsoring that last bit of radio.  Yeah.  That's great.  That was sponsored.  Yeah, we hand out the 5-Hour Energy to the listeners when they stop by to check out the  show.  It wakes up your brain and gets you bright, alert, and focused without the jitters or the  crash later in the day.  5-Hour Energy.  Go check it out this weekend.  I think we also have to thank AdamandEve.com for supplying us with the lovely...  Oh, the sex toys. 
[03:44:00]  Oh, really?  I thought you got those at Target.  Patty.  Into the mic, please.  Into the mic.  Into the mic, please.  Pretend it's a dick.  That's it.  Do you...  I know we've given you a vibrator.  Do you use that at home?  Yeah, she does.  Well, I got to admit it, you know.  Yeah.  Well, sure.  But I think every adult does that.  Well, yeah.  So what do you think of when you used your vibrator at home?  I guess, you know, after I've had a very stressful day, and I've been under a lot of stress lately, 
[03:44:30]  and eventually it loosens you up.  Oh, it loosens you up.  Wait, what is she stressed about?  What are you stressed about, Patty?  Not meeting Mr. Right?  No.  You work at Starbucks.  I have...  She does?  Well, I'm in a...  I'm going into a debt consolidation program next month to help me get all my medical bills  and stuff.  Wait, a debt consolidation?  So they're going to tell you, like, to fucking put the money you save for stamps?  I couldn't think of anything else really inexpensive.  How much debt could you be in? 
[03:45:00]  Tens of dollars?  Well, I'm just so much...  Debt consolidation.  They're going to give her a bunch of penny rolls.  Here.  Consolidate your...  Consolidate those in these rolls and bring them to the bank, you idiot.  80 pounds of pennies.  Oh, Patty.  You know, I have a lot of debt.  You know, on my XM bill, I'm paying them off $25 a week.  Holy shit.  So I'm turned off it the next month until I could get paid off.  She's got a priority.  Wait, how is she paying for XM?  Wait, how much...  Hold on, Patty.  We're trying to help you out. 
[03:45:30]  How much do you owe XM?  I owed them, like...  I owed 103.  I gave them 25, so now I'm down to, like, in the 80s.  She's paying off a VIG for fucking XM.  My fucking heart is breaking.  Yeah, I'm paying off medical bills and stuff that I owe for clinical tests because I have...  What kind of tests did you do?  Well, I'm developing a lot of arthritis in all my joints.  And it's painful.  Gee, I didn't notice it while you're fucking...  Jimmy.  Well, it's painful to rub my wrist or my hand.  I think we should call her a health provider. 
[03:46:00]  I don't think she has arthritis.  I'm about $3,000 in debt for...  All right, well, I'm not giving you that, but I'll give you a 60 towards your XM bill,  and then you can get 20 for somebody else.  All right, don't clap.  I'm about 60 bucks.  Oh, boy, now we've got to dig or else we look like assholes.  We look like scumbags now if we don't give our money.  As soon as the show is over, she has to make the brrr sound on my balls.  Patty, I got $4.  There you go.  That a girl, Patty.  Pick it up one at a time.  Say thank you four times.  Here's 50 for you, Patty. 
[03:46:30]  Here you go, you fucking prostitute.  There you go.  Take it away.  I'll have some on the night table for you now, scram.  You gave me a deep dick in and sang for your supper.  We got it.  All right, yeah.  Patty, I'm just a guest.  You turned on today.  Yeah, you're just a guest.  Patty, I'm just a guest, or I'd throw you a few minutes.  How much do you owe altogether?  That'll cover your arthritis right there.  Well, it originally was $103,000, but I started making payment arrangements.  No, all your debt in your whole life.  I have it all in a little green book. 
[03:47:00]  I'm about $3,000 in debt to everybody in the world.  I have people calling me up and stuff.  Everybody in the world.  Where do you live?  I live in an SRO.  My rent went up another $100, too.  What's an SRO?  Something retarded?  Single room occupancy on 43rd Street.  Do you share a bathroom with people that are also SROs?  No, I don't.  Only with my cat.  You shit in a box?  No, she shits in a box.  Oh, you potty mouth. 
[03:47:30]  You potty mouth.  You use the S word.  Everybody uses that word.  Oh, okay.  No, you don't.  Yeah.  Not a lady.  A lady doesn't use that word.  No.  Well, I'm a lady in different ways.  60 bucks.  60 bucks in a mask.  I will admit, I do have a mouth on me.  You can use it for anything.  Jesus Christ.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  So, you're dead.  I don't feel good about myself.  Well, that's why I'm in the consolidation program.  They'll take everything.  It might even reduce my debt.  Enough about the consolidation. 
[03:48:00]  Awesome.  I know.  It's that fucking accent that's going through me like a knife.  Isn't it the worst?  I hope they possess your computer and fucking chair.  Oh, no.  So, you have to just stand there, pick up pens.  I'm taking off my panty.  Let's make her work a corner or something.  Yeah.  That we did.  Do you realize you could whore yourself out and make like hundreds and hundreds a day?  No, she couldn't do that.  No, she couldn't.  Those women die early.  Dude.  Oh, she would.  Yeah, exactly the point.  She'll live forever. 
[03:48:30]  You put her on like Craigslist.  Somebody will pay good money to fuck a 50-year-old version.  Imagine this fucker showing up at your house.  I think I have an idea.  Oh, Dan.  Dan might have an idea.  They still have like live shows somewhere in New York, right?  Yeah.  Maybe we can get her in a booth or something and have all the fans go down there and pay a dollar.  Oh, like.  And she has to dance for them.  How about we do it right here?  Like a peep world or something.  A show world or something.  We've got a bunch of fans here right now.  We could like do this right.  We've got a poll.  We've got the platform. 
[03:49:00]  You want to dance and maybe the fans can throw you some money?  They're not going to just throw you money.  You've got to have to work for it.  You're going to have to work for it.  You're going to earn it.  Like a working girl.  I'll do a strip tease.  Like a working girl.  A strip tease.  I turn the bleachers sideways for the stripper poll.  That'll buy a lot of ibuprofen.  I turn the bleachers sideways.  I turn the bleachers sideways.  I turn the bleachers sideways.  I turn the bleachers sideways.  I turn the bleachers sideways.  Wow.  Here we are.  Exotic West Coast dancers.  Hey, Patty, what song do you want to dance to?  The Emperor's Club.  Yeah. 
[03:49:30]  Hi, Client Nine.  Leave your socks on.  I'm trying to think.  I can't think.  I can't think.  I can't think.  I can't think.  What song do you want to dance to?  I don't know.  How will something something by...  Feel good?  You two...  Motley Crue is always good.  No, you know the fucking stripper song.  What the fuck is it?  You two mysterious ways?  Oh, what?  The old song?  Marcy's Playground.  Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.  Chair or something.  Candy.  Candy, yes.  The candy song.  Yeah.  What's the candy song?  Oh, you'll know in a second, honey.  It was by Sammy Davis Jr. 
[03:50:00]  I don't know the titles, but I know my music.  Then you don't know the fucking music if you don't know the titles.  Exactly.  Thanks.  What do you say?  Your ear picks up sounds?  I know music.  How cute is this girl?  Yeah.  Well, we should have her warm up for Patty.  You're right.  I would have taken the underwear off and just said, fuck the fake pussy.  God, she'd get language.  Yeah.  Yes, I don't know how to ask you this, but do you ever shit in somebody's mouth for a  few dollars?  Patty?  Yeah. 
[03:50:30]  What song?  She goes, I wouldn't take money for that.  How about a George Michael song?  Oh!  Oh!  A George Michael song?  All right.  Which one?  No.  We've got to throw Marcy's Playground.  No, George Michael's.  Candy.  Come on.  Candy.  I think that candy thing.  I don't know what it's...  I don't...  All right.  It's Marcy's Playground.  How about the theme to Barney Miller?  Nobody knows.  Nobody knows.  The whole audience is like 20.  Boom.  Yeah. 
[03:51:00]  Such an awful thing.  Dickey Punchcock is very confused.  I didn't some feedback.  Dickey Punchcock?  He says...  Of the Punchcocks?  Yeah.  When I was in an SRO, I thought she had SROs, which are shriveled, rotten ovaries.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  That had a hurt.  Yeah.  That was just...  Hurtful.  All right, Patty, you ready to dance for everybody?  Yeah.  And if the audience likes what they're seeing, you can throw a buck or two at her.  Or preferably change right at her head.  He's kidding, sir. 
[03:51:30]  The fucking...  The lunatic in the Phillies had stood up with a fistful of change.  Right.  She was just kidding.  All right, Patty, ready?  Yeah.  If you do well, you might, I don't know, gain another seven or eight bucks here.  Have fun.  Can we have the music play?  She is a trooper.  I'll give her that one.  All right, turn it up.  Go ahead, Patty.  This is you.  All right, Patty.  You gonna dance or...?  Look at her.  Go.  Go, Patty.  You're not even moving yet.  All right. 
[03:52:00]  Oh, my God.  You better go.  She's kind of wiggling from side to side right now.  Yeah.  The audience is horrified.  No, it's a pretty sexy guy, Patty.  That's not bad, Patty.  All right, they're getting into it a little bit.  She's got her jean capri pants on.  I've been to Bird's Place in Ronkonkoma at 1130 in the morning and have not seen strippers  this bad.  All right, the show is off.  Patty is topless.  All right.  That's starting to throw money.  Wow. 
[03:52:30]  All right.  Don't pick it up yet, you greedy.  Don't pick it up, Patty.  Yeah.  Make believe you don't see the money.  That's what a good stripper does.  Right.  All right.  Now she's working on her jeans a little bit.  I'm gonna have to go to a shrink after this.  Yeah.  They like what they're seeing so far, eh?  Do they?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, you heard that, Patty?  You show pink, you'll see green.  Wow.  Unzip those sexy fucking Dutch boy paint shorts.  All right.  She's slowly making the jeans off. 
[03:53:00]  Last time I saw the body like that, it was chasing Reese's Pieces.  Patty's down to the XM satellite panties.  Jesus Christ.  There she goes.  Kind of wiggling from side to side.  That's good.  That's deserved a few...  There's some change going up there, but...  A few quarters.  That's you know, Patty.  Oh, my God.  She's going for the pink.  Don't.  She's sexy.  I'll give you 20 if you don't go any further.  Let's show it.  Oh, she's teasing.  She is a tease.  She's teasing.  Wow.  She's pulling the pants down a little bit, showing butt crack in the back. 
[03:53:30]  I'll give you 20 if you don't go any further.  Let's show it.  Oh, she's teasing.  She is a tease.  She's teasing.  Wow.  She's teasing.  Oh, she showed a little of the pink and then pulled her pants back up.  Wow.  Very burlesque show-like.  She's moving like she's in a body cast.  Yeah, get that hair out of the way of those pits.  That's it.  She moves the hair around a little.  Come on, Patty.  You know what they want.  You know what they want.  You know what they want.  If you did this in a tree house, you'd get arrested.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it. 
[03:54:00]  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  Apparently it's all right when it's on the fucking...  This is our tree house, yeah.  Yeah, I know.  You're absolutely right.  You guys are fucking really crazy.  All right, come on, Patty.  Patty's teasing the pink and they're not...  They're getting frustrated now.  Uh-oh.  She's pulling down her...  Now what the fuck?  There we go.  She's not having a crack.  She's thinking about pulling down the pants. 
[03:54:30]  All right, hold on.  Pull them up.  Music, pull them up.  We're going to the second song.  Now another song's got it.  All right, Patty.  A lot of money coming out for her.  All right, here's the second song.  A lady's choice.  Just keep thinking about how much your wrists hurt.  Yeah, this will pay for that arthritis medicine.  Very good tune.  Yeah.  There she goes.  She's just popping.  She's getting back into it.  She's rocking now.  She's down to the satellite panties. 
[03:55:00]  You know what's funny?  The whole audience is still watching.  Oh, somebody took their money back.  You're not happy.  I'm not happy.  He got changed.  He made change.  Oh, he made change.  I made it for the Jew in the back.  What the fuck?  She's not an ATM machine.  The fucking guy made change.  That's hilarious.  That's hilarious.  All right, Patty.  You know what you got to do if you want to get a few more bucks.  Money shot.  That's right, Patty.  You know what you got to do.  Put on your shirt.  That's why they call it the money shot, Patty. 
[03:55:30]  By the way, Patty will be available in the back room for blowjobs after this dance.  In the champagne room, also known as our office.  Patty working the pants.  Oh, what the fuck?  Wow.  Nick has turned away.  What's wrong, Nick?  That's great.  Patty, slide him down.  What are you doing?  Patty, what are you doing?  You're only getting changed because you're not giving the people what they want.  It's like you're covering...  I've seen more attractive dancers than Mos Eisley.  What's that?  That's Spaceport from Star Wars. 
[03:56:00]  Patty, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  You got to remove the panties and then the money will be a flying.  Come on, Patty.  Show the pink and the brown.  Yeah.  Some pink and some stink, Patty.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  She is totally nude.  There she goes.  Totally nude.  Totally nude.  Patty, you should bend over.  That's great.  Anthony Clubhouse.  Show them ass crack.  That's good.  Bend all the way over, Patty.  Wow.  Slap that ass.  Slap that ass. 
[03:56:30]  You got to turn around and slap the ass.  Do the ass slap.  Look over your shoulder and slap your ass.  There you go.  God.  Please, God.  Please, God.  Make that crane collapse on us now.  Wow, Patty.  Patty has a nice rump.  Jesus Christ.  Would you tag that?  Would you tag that?  Would you?  Like tag Patty?  Not if it was.  Tag it like a fucking rhino.  Like a fucking elk with a disease. 
[03:57:00]  A disease.  Wow.  There it is.  Ladies and gentlemen, that was Stalker Patty.  Make sure you tip her very well.  It was half dance, half gynecological.  Good job.  I don't know what the fuck that was.  Nice going, Patty.  Wow, Patty.  Put your shorts if you're in fucking Kentucky noodling.  Noodling.  See, Patty?  Here she goes.  Now you only owe 60 bucks to fucking... 
[03:57:30]  There you go.  You're paying off that debt.  Boy, are you.  You can make some money doing that on a nightly basis.  Danny, how much did she collect?  She made a fantastic 25 bucks.  25 bucks.  25 bucks.  Not bad.  Thank you.  25 bucks for a life.  25 dollars.  Patty, you want to do individual lap dancers now?  And uh...  I'm out of money, man.  I'm sorry.  Out of money.  There's our listeners.  Look at her picking up on money like a real stripper. 
[03:58:00]  She sure is.  She's like, do you validate?  All right.  All right, Patty.  Good job, Patty.  Thank you, Patty.  Not bad, Patty.  Seriously.  Yeah, she was working the poll.  I'm the shiest person in the world.  You're not shy, Pat.  How are you shy?  You fucked me in a fake vagina and they took off your clothes for money.  You're not shy.  You're not shy.  You're an Amish hooker. 
[03:58:30]  Really?  I'm shy.  She strapped out a fake cock and gave me the business.  How are you...  I licked your nipples.  How are you shy?  You just did two fucking dances for money.  Naked.  Completely naked.  That's not shy, Patty.  And that awful dance.  Robert De Niro.  She danced like the fucking robot on the front of that Queen album.  When I'm out in public, I don't talk very much.  What's up, Patty?  What's up, Patty?  I usually don't talk very much.  I'm a quiet person.  You don't shut up. 
[03:59:00]  Jesus Christ.  I'm emotionally scarred from this day.  Yeah, yeah.  This one's gonna stick with me.  Yeah.  I don't think there's anything else to do except line of the day.  Line of the day.  Wrap it up.  The only thing I was at was like watching Billy and Bear get on his own.  Look at that fucking mess.  I still can't get over it.  Line of the day is brought to you by.  Oh, I thought you meant Patty again.  Oh.  He's looking at the crane.  What's the bigger wreck?  The bigger wreck. 
[03:59:30]  Ricky Yam from Massachusetts.  He says it all.  He goes, she's making money to pay off XM, but XM is making more money off of her.  I love the irony.  Yeah.  It's just a vicious circle here.  Don, fucking pay Patty's XM bill.  How does Patty not have a free XM?  Like, Patty, if you had any sense of fucking pride or balls, you'd walk up to Don Wicklund  and go, hey, give me a fucking subscription and a radio.  She does more radio.  And he'd go, show me your pussy.  Yeah.  All right. 
[04:00:00]  She does more radio than Fez.  Yeah.  She should be paid.  I would never walk up to someone like that.  Oh, it's only Don Wicklund.  Oh, she's still doing the shy act.  Yeah.  Oh, I would never.  I would never do that.  I would never.  Give me your balls.  Yeah.  Let me teabag me.  I'm a shy girl.  Give me your Roman Wu helmet.  But that's the furthest I'm going to go because I'm a shy girl.  I'm not going any further.  Right.  Five minutes later, she's in a tub with a Japanese guy putting an eel in her pussy. 
[04:00:30]  And I've been paying my own bill for hours.  All right.  We know.  We don't care.  Good for you, Patty.  How about you get another girl and shit in a cup and eat it?  That's right.  I'll do that.  I'm shy.  That's it.  Two cryptic retards, one cup.  The video didn't work.  All right.  Yeah.  I've never seen it.  Oh, you haven't seen that one?  No.  I think we ought to cue.  I think we ought to cue that up. 
[04:01:00]  All right.  Patty, get over here.  Come here, Patty.  I'm actually getting queasy, I swear to God.  Patty.  Get right in that seat there so you get a good view over here.  Patty.  And you'll see another complete disaster.  Patty, I'll tell you this.  Patty, if you do what you see in this video, I'll give you $1,000 cash on the spot.  Where's Sam?  Sam's fucked.  Opie, I'll give you $2,000 if you don't make her do it.  I get an idea on what it's about.  Wait, not yet.  We've got to wait for Sam to come.  Sit down.  Two girls, one cup.  I will never do that.  Stalker Patty's going to watch two girls, one cup.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Sam maybe got against the camera. 
[04:01:30]  Yeah, let's...  Patty, get on mic, will you?  Pull the mic close to you.  She just doesn't...  You don't know how to...  Right there.  There you go.  All right.  All right.  This is two girls, one cup.  We're stalking Patty.  Put the mic near your mouth, God damn it.  Patty!  Don't look away.  No.  Turn it.  There.  There you go.  Don't close your eyes.  Don't look away.  This reminds me of my job at Deary Queen.  Wait.  Here we go.  Ew.  She went to the bathroom.  What makes you say that? 
[04:02:00]  She's not quite a bathroom.  Patty.  Patty, you gotta look.  Look.  What are they doing, Patty?  Patty, watch it.  Stop the tape.  See what happens?  Now rewind.  What are they doing, Patty?  Describe it.  It's a commercial for Tic Tacs.  They're eating it like an ice cream cone.  They must be on drugs.  Look, Patty.  You gotta watch.  Look, Patty.  Now we gotta rewind.  If you don't watch, we're gonna rewind until you've watched the whole thing.  What the fuck?  And we'll make you do this.  No.  Oh, my.  Patty, watch.  It's disgusting.  Look. 
[04:02:30]  Ooh.  Patty.  Don't make us fucking pin your eyes open like Alex.  Oh.  In clockwork.  What's going on, Patty?  Explain.  Yeah, what's going on?  He's throwing it up.  I think.  And they're eating it.  They gotta be on freaking drugs.  They have to be coked up or something.  Oh, nice shit shake right in the mouth.  They have to be on drugs.  Coked up.  Yeah, because when I've done coke, that's the first thing I want.  There's a nice heaping help of the shit.  Yeah.  No normal person would do that. 
[04:03:00]  Exactly, Patty.  It would have to be freaking high.  You know what the weird part is?  They got a clean bill of health from their doctors.  Yeah.  Do you ever think Al-Qaeda has a point?  It's still disgusting.  Okay, bring in the cup of shit.  Patty.  Oh, stop.  No.  Yeah, bring it in.  Bring in the cup of shit.  Oh, hell no.  Patty.  Do it.  For all your debt, $3,000.  Wait, wait.  What won't you do?  I won't do that.  Do what?  Do what?  Put it in my mouth.  Put what in your mouth?  The shit.  Sorry. 
[04:03:30]  For $3,000.  No.  Not even.  Cash.  Cash right here.  I will not do it.  $3,000 to eat it.  $5,000.  Five grand.  Bring in the shit cup.  Bring in the shit cup.  No.  A cup of shit.  No.  You just gotta lick it like an ice cream and then swallow what's on your tongue.  Let someone puke in your mouth for a thousand.  No.  What?  $7,000.  That's disgusting.  Patty.  No.  $7,000.  I can't.  That's disgusting.  Oh, well.  She's not protesting now as much. 
[04:04:00]  That's disgusting.  That's disgusting.  We know it's disgusting.  You don't have to sell us on the point that it's disgusting.  What's disgusting to share the price?  No one's giving you seven grand to fucking lick real ice cream.  Yeah.  You won't be in debt anymore.  Fucking cotton candy.  No.  Here you go.  Here's some Bazooka Joe bubblegum.  $18,000.  No.  It's shit.  Oh, no.  It's not giving us chunky monkey.  It's not going to make your breath anymore.  No.  Come on, Patty.  I'm throwing up just thinking about it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Maybe not.  It's got a very... 
[04:04:30]  Alright, we'll give you 12 grand to lick Iraq's tongue.  Oh, wow.  That's...  Wow.  That's...  That's mean.  That's very nasty.  I'm sorry.  You ready?  Two girls, one puke shirt.  Boo.  A boo.  They gotta be on drugs.  Yes.  How much would it cost?  No, no.  For you to eat...  Wait.  For you to lick shit?  No.  I will not do that.  How much?  No one...  No normal person in the world would do that.  Fifth...  Would you do it for $10 million? 
[04:05:00]  Yeah.  Would you do it for $10 million?  I'm gonna pee.  I'm gonna pee.  Yeah, but then the whole world would know.  Alright, alright, alright.  But you would do it.  You would do it.  I don't think so, no.  $10 million?  You wouldn't lick shit?  No.  You're crazy.  Alright.  I am.  We rarely do this, but we'll throw in an XM radio too.  Yeah.  I have one.  That's a deal breaker.  I already have one.  Oh.  Oh, well.  Well...  Look, you let us down again, Patty.  What can I tell you about?  I can't.  I'm sorry.  I'm not gonna lick shit. 
[04:05:30]  I can't believe it.  Huh?  I can't believe it.  I can't lick shit.  I can't lick shit.  Sorry.  Alright.  Can she, like, talk us through the video again?  Just, Patty, I wanna hear...  You have to describe it for the audience.  They haven't seen this video.  Yeah.  I gotta see it again.  You gotta talk through the whole thing and let us know what's going on, okay?  Could you play like your nipples the whole time?  Yeah, be a professional broadcaster, alright?  Yeah.  You talk through the whole video.  It's about 40 seconds long.  Here we go, Patty.  Tell the radio world what's going on.  Right from the beginning. 
[04:06:00]  And go.  They're licking each other's boobs.  Well, no.  The one girl's licking the other girl's boobs.  And at the same time, she's going to the bathroom in a cup.  Mm-hmm.  And they're licking it like it's an ice cream cone.  Uh-huh.  Keep going.  The tongues are going in and out.  And they're acting like they're enjoying it.  Mm-hmm.  Which I can't imagine.  And she's eating it.  She's swallowing it. 
[04:06:30]  And she's smiling.  And now they're throwing it up in each other's mouths.  And, oh, she threw it up and this other one is going to eat it.  Oh, God.  Now it's falling all over the other one's boobs.  And now the dark hair.  Oh, and now she threw up again.  And the other one's eating it.  And, of course, I'm not going to eat for the rest of the day.  The rest of the day. 
[04:07:00]  Hey.  Right on.  All right, Patty.  Nice description.  Yes.  All right.  That was good.  Are we going to do line of the day now?  Yeah.  I think it's fine.  What else can we fucking do with this thing?  Patty, let's just toss her out the window.  Right.  Wouldn't that be fun to just throw her out the window and watch her hit the sidewalk?  God, I'd laugh.  No, you wouldn't.  Sorry, Patty.  I just thought it would kind of be fun.  All right.  Line of the day is brought to you by Cardscan.  Get all of your contacts organized in just a few seconds. 
[04:07:30]  Check out the device that nobody should be without at Cardscan.com slash radio one.  Here is a runner-up line of the day.  Yeah, like he had no control of his own ass.  I'm the ripper.  I ripped one ripper.  Oh, wow.  Great reaction from the studio audience after that runner-up line of the day.  It was funny at the time.  Here's the next one.  Yeah.  Let's just say you want to see the head bob for a few minutes. 
[04:08:00]  Whatever.  You want the games on.  Right.  Get the mood for it.  Get used to it.  Yeah.  Your new girlfriend had dental surgery due to a misunderstanding about politics.  Nice.  You guys have fun out there?  Yeah.  Nice, huh?  Making us work on a Friday.  We'd call these Friday shows in if the audience didn't show up.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Terrell Owens showed up at the wrong place, so he's going to be here any second. 
[04:08:30]  Yeah, he's a half a block away.  Is he the spokesman for Alzheimer's?  Yeah, that's what he's going to talk about today.  He showed up the wrong address.  That's a damn good point.  That's a damn good point.  Nick DiPaolo, Caroline's, two shows tonight only.  That was good.  In Times Square, 212-757-4100.  Highly recommend you guys go see Nick tonight if you don't have plans.  One more runner-up.  One more runner-up.  What if your husband, Vic, or your boyfriend who you were in love with, 
[04:09:00]  when you were kissing...  This Vic is something.  If he said Patty...  I need to get popped in the shitter.  He said...  Thank you, Patty.  You're welcome.  Do you like us better than Ron and Fez?  I love you all the same.  Oh, boy.  See, it's slowly changing.  Because I love XM2.  Wow.  That's what they say first.  You're all dear in my heart.  Half politician, half whore.  If you had to choose, which show would you choose? 
[04:09:30]  If you had to.  If I had to choose...  Sean Hannity.  Sean Hannity.  My first...  Well, you know, I...  My first love was always the Opie and Anthony show.  Was.  Mm-hmm.  You know, because it would be the longest, and then Ron and Fez would be almost tied.  You know, but I love them both the same.  But you have to choose.  It's either that or a beheading.  That was a great Hillary Clinton fucking answer that she's giving.  You gotta choose.  Well, I love them both.  They're great.  Really? 
[04:10:00]  Fucking Howard Dean over here.  Yeah.  You have to choose, Patty.  I'm sorry.  I have to choose.  If you had to choose one show.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I was gonna be beheaded.  Yeah.  I would have to go with the first show that I've been involved with.  Yeah.  That's Opie and Anthony.  Let's say that crane across the street is gonna collapse and crush this studio and kill  one of the shows.  Oh, I don't think that.  Either Opie and Anthony morning or midday.  When does it happen?  It would happen at night when nobody would see you.  No.  Good answer. 
[04:10:30]  I don't want to kill anyone.  No.  One of the shows has to get crushed by the crane.  You have to because it's either that or beheading.  What show gets crushed by the crane?  I don't kill anybody.  What show would you rather?  What show?  You are God for a day and you have to make this collapse.  Anthony, let's make it a little easier.  We don't know if they're gonna die, but the crane definitely will come right through the  studio ceiling.  Yeah.  So what do you think?  What show?  Can I have everybody get away and escape?  What show?  What show?  What show gets the crane? 
[04:11:00]  What show is here live when the crane collapses?  Yeah.  What show?  Come on, Patty.  Mad money.  It's up to you.  It's up to you.  Oh, I don't want to pick and choose.  Bring in the sword.  What show?  Come on, Infidel.  Alright, we'll add big Kev's geek stuff too.  Oh, wow.  No.  There's a no brainer.  Nobody would die.  Nobody would die.  No.  You have to choose.  Pick a show.  Yeah.  Who's underneath the crane wreckage?  Anybody.  Iraq.  Who are they pulling out from the wreckage? 
[04:11:30]  You're in Iraq beheading if you don't answer.  What do you got?  They're not pulling anybody out because everyone's gonna get out alive.  Who's bloody red head are they pulling out from under the wreckage?  You're making me do something extremely heartbreaking and hard because I love you both.  Make a choice.  What show?  You have to make a choice.  I just couldn't.  You have to.  Do that or beheading.  Patty.  Patty, I got an eight o'clock show at Caroline's.  Make a fucking choice.  I'm gonna punch you.  Yeah.  Patty, it's not really happening, okay? 
[04:12:00]  But you have to.  So just fucking make a choice.  Just pick one.  Pick one.  What show?  I don't want to say it.  Just say it.  Who gets the crane?  Who gets the crane?  Come on.  Penn Jillette.  Who gets the crane?  Um.  Crashing through the ceiling of the studio.  Come on.  Come on.  Oh, God.  You're doing something with my mind.  Right.  Just say it.  Come on.  What's left of it?  Patty. 
[04:12:30]  All right.  Oh, God.  I'm.  Just say it.  Oh.  What are you sleeping with Fez?  What the fuck?  It's an obvious answer.  Patty.  Oh.  Come on.  What show gets the crane?  You got five seconds or I'm taking that duct tape and putting it on your head and tearing  it out.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Um.  Opie and Anthony.  You know, I guess the morning show would be saved.  It would be.  Oh, boy.  Ronnie's not.  Ron and Fez. 
[04:13:00]  You wish Ron and Fez got crushed by a crane?  What?  You suck.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe you wish death on Ron and Fez.  I did not.  Holy shit.  In a horrible crane accident.  We were testing you.  You don't answer that question ever.  Oh.  You don't ever answer it.  Ever.  That's why I just mean it.  You wish.  I don't know who your favorite show is.  Oh, my God.  But you know who is death on me.  I don't mean it.  I can't believe you wish the crane collapses on the Ron and Fez show.  No.  May the Lord strike you down at Starbucks.  Oh, you're horrible.  No.  I don't mean it, though.  Oh, my God.  What a horrible, heartless bitch you are. 
[04:13:30]  No.  Oh, I got to apologize to the Ron and Fez show.  I didn't make it to do that.  Fezzy is one of the sweetest guys ever.  I know he is.  And I love them both.  And you want him to be pulled dead from the wreckage of a crane collapse.  That's what you said.  Oh, my God.  That's what you said.  I didn't pick anybody.  Holy shit.  Dave is a brand new daddy.  And you want a widow and an orphan left as they pull his lifeless body out of the  bottom of a wrecked pile of cranes?  No.  Oh, you are.  And Ronnie has suffered enough trying to keep that whole goddamn show together.  No.  Ronnie would probably be the only one happy that it happened. 
[04:14:00]  He'd be like, thank God I'm being crushed.  No.  It's more painless than doing this show.  You know what?  Nobody would have a show in the afternoon.  Everybody would be on in the evening.  It's too late, Patty.  Too late.  You wish the crane falls on them.  No, I didn't.  Now it falls on them.  How are you going to do an evening show if the crane falls in the afternoon?  Right.  What the fuck, Patty?  You know I don't mean it.  No.  You said it.  Now that Ronnie and Fez and Eastside Dave and the crew, they cannot do radio anymore.  No.  Who gets to do Uninformed now?  Because now that's got to go on. 
[04:14:30]  Who does Uninformed if Ronnie can't?  You are cruel.  Well, considering that none of this is real.  All right, but who does Uninformed now that Ronnie can't?  Look out the window.  What's there?  Yeah, there's a crane.  It's a fucking crane.  Not real?  What do you see there?  I don't see a crane.  I see a building.  It's a fucking crane right there.  It's a crane.  It's got Fez's name on it.  It's not even pointed this way.  Wait, does it fall, dummy?  No.  I love them all.  False.  Who does Uninformed now that Ronnie can't do it?  No. 
[04:15:00]  I love them all.  This is like a bad father's abuse.  I have more love for everybody on XM than anybody in the world and you know that.  This is like fucking torture.  Sure.  All right.  They want to fucking let us loose at Guantanamo.  Oh, my God.  Well, Ronnie's not going to be happy when he hears this.  Look at old Governor Squinty.  Holy shit.  Look at him.  Look at him.  Oh, God.  Oh, is that awful?  He's not fucking blind.  He's exhausted.  He's exhausted.  Yeah. 
[04:15:30]  Jesus.  Let the ambient wear off before you do a press conference.  Look at this guy.  Dude.  Bloomberg is boring the shit out of him.  Yeah.  Turn him away from the sun.  He's sucking it up.  What a fucking, what a bright future this city has.  Oh, fuck.  Go to MSNBC if you want to enjoy what we just saw.  He's actually looking into the sun and he has no idea.  There's just smoke coming out of his ears.  Is that a flashlight, I feel?  No, it's a star.  It looks like he's ready to sneeze at any moment.  Oh, my God. 
[04:16:00]  Someone wake up the governor.  I'm a what?  I think he's doing this in honor of Harvey Korman passing away.  Moment of silence.  Think about that one.  Wow, he could just think.  He could just stand there.  Looks like he's dozing off.  Oh, don't try to...  Oh, and then he opens his eyes like, uh...  Why?  What's he doing?  I don't know.  There's probably bed bugs on him.  It's like Jose Feliciano when he sings.  Fucking Ty's all crooked.  No. 
[04:16:30]  The Ty is crooked.  Oh, his tie is crooked.  Oh, my God.  This is horrible.  Jesus.  And he's going to balance the budget.  Oh.  He's going to take the mic.  This is one of the worst catastrophes I've ever smelled.  I wish I could take the catastrophe.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Damn it.  He's not even near the site.  He's at like a parking lot in a Dunkin' Donnets.  He's fucking... 
[04:17:00]  As we look upon this wreckage around me...  He's saying it's the wrong way he's looking.  Yeah.  He's on a...  He's in a rest area on the fucking turnpike.  Oh, what a fucking sand sack he looks like.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  That is awesome.  He's got to get sunglasses.  He looks like he's dozing off.  He really does.  Yeah.  He's ready for sunglasses.  But that's appropriate.  He's ready for sunglasses.  Well, he just had cataracts surgery.  What?  He just had cataracts.  He just had cataracts.  Exactly.  I don't care about his car. 
[04:17:30]  It's all...  Wow.  Oh, shit, Jimmy.  You don't care about his car?  How about this one?  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  All right.  Cataract.  I think it's time for the line of the day.  Oh.  Oh, he's going to speak.  Oh, no.  Pot him up.  He's not even into the mic.  Put him into the mic.  And sympathy and our prayers go out to the family of the construction worker killed  and two construction workers who are in serious condition as we speak. 
[04:18:00]  This is a terrible tragedy.  The witnesses to the incident.  How do you know it was a terrible tragedy?  I'm informed by a poor President Springer who got here pretty quickly after the incident.  They let me steer the crane for a minute.  Were very, very auditory about the Office of Emergency Management and all the services  that the mayor's office provided.  They told me the break was on the right.  The mayor that the residents here were very, very much impressed by how quickly and how  professionally they operated.  When this is all over, we're going to have to take a look at these crane accidents on 
[04:18:30]  March 15th, two days before I was sworn in.  We take a look at anything.  Exactly.  We had to go to 51st Street for a similar incident.  I'm going to ask the Department of Labor and also the Department of Housing and Community  Renewal to look into this a little further.  Someone's got to look into it.  There's no need to speculate now on how this happened.  That will all be investigated.  The crane fell.  But certainly these types of accidents are all too frequent.  Excuse me. 
[04:19:00]  I'm headed to Pearl.  Let me just summarize and we'll take a couple of questions.  One fatality, two seriously injured.  All construction workers, one pedestrian, minor injury.  Happened about eight this morning.  It is incidentally a different type of crane from the one that collapsed on 50.  Oh, God, give him some visine.  That looks painful.  Oh, Patterson.  It's fucking high as a kite.  Look at him.  Dry eyes.  Yeah, where did he get some dust from the accident in his eyes? 
[04:19:30]  Useless ping pong balls in his head.  Yeah.  That's right.  His eyes should be coming out of a Vietnamese girl's pussy.  Oh, my God.  Bravo.  Oh, an Aggie.  All right, why don't we do line of the day and get the fuck out of here?  Get the fuck out of here.  Oh, good idea.  Jesus Christ.  That Jasper-eyed idiot.  Two fucking awful glass things in his head looking the wrong way.  Oof.  One goes this way, one goes that way.  And a big nose in the middle going, what do you want from me? 
[04:20:00]  Who trims his mustache?  Come on, Bergson.  He's not blind.  Gotta give him a Hitler mustache as a little joke.  That'd be funny.  He walks around all day with a Hitler mustache.  I am the Fuhrer of New York.  The Jews are up in arms.  Hmm.  Let's do line of the day.  Ah, line of the day.  That's right.  Here.  Comes.  Comes.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day. 
[04:20:30]  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Rowan has two emotions.  You must have to touch him the same way as brother did.  How's your dog?  Is it still dead?  What the fuck?  This is the best transformation I have ever seen.  Oh, my God.  This guy should be in a movie.  My condolences.  That is going to be a great Rowan day.  My favorite part, by the way, is when he goes, he's still dead.  He goes, here, boy. 
[04:21:00]  Did you catch here, boy?  Did he say here, boy?  Did he say here, boy?  Can you play that one more time?  Holy shit.  Let's catch here, boy.  Rowan has two emotions.  You must have to touch him the same way as brother did.  How's your dog?  Is it still dead?  Here, boy.  What the fuck?  This is the best transformation I have ever seen.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  This guy should be in a movie.  My condolences.  Here, boy.  Here, boy.  Here, boy.  What a cruel man he is.  Get me those for my replay for fucking Monday. 
[04:21:30]  That laugh.  Can I say one last thing?  Oh, we'd appreciate it.  Jesus.  Ron and Fez, 12 to 3, and I love you.  Oh, God.  It's too late.  There is no crane.  It's too late.  It's too late.  It's too late.  I apologize to Ronnie.  Yeah, Patty.  To Ronnie.  Wow.  For myself and Patty.  I didn't know the name of Ronnie's special show.  An idiot I am.  You wished horrific things on those guys.  Yeah.  I didn't wish anything.  God, how awful that would be.  You know it.  Being trapped under rubble. 
[04:22:00]  And you're all being silly.  Think of poor Fez, how he'd feel.  Right.  He doesn't like tunnels and stuff.  And he'd be trapped underneath crane wreckage.  No, he wouldn't.  Because you said so.  You are saying that.  Have fun trying to sleep tonight, along with your thoughts.  No, you are saying that.  This is relentless.  No.  And relentless.  I used to do this in school all the time with people.  Just spend hours.  All right.  We gotta go home.  Like a little Gestapo.  You guys, let's hear it for Nick DiPaolo.  Nick DiPaolo.  Nick DiPaolo.  Nick DiPaolo.  Nick DiPaolo.  Nick at Caroline's tonight.  Nick's fantastic.  Thank you for having me, folks.  I appreciate it.  And we're broadcasting live from Boston on Monday, so we'll see you guys real soon. 
[04:22:30]  Bye.  Oh.  You know, I'm starting to get hot.  Oh.  You know, I'm starting to get hot.  Oh, no.  I'm gonna give up my virginity.  I'm a sport.  Maybe take a little cock right into my mouth.  It must hurt.  Maybe take it in the rear.  Maybe bang me up the ass.  That's what they call me.  She's a freak.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi. 
[04:23:00]  Hi.  That's what they call me.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  She's a freak.  What do you want me to do?  I'm not gonna be facing the wall.  What do you want me to do?  I've always wanted a juicy cock.  Put it between the boobs.  I'm into the TF thing.  Put it between the boobs.  Put it in the pits.  Put it in the pits.  My favorite oral treat.  My favorite eating cock.  I'm hungry for a big, fat, juicy cock.  Stand the right.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag. 
[04:23:30]  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Shoot your big wad of cum right into my mouth.  Oh.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty. </pre>
