<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with chaotic banter, including homophobic slurs aimed at someone called "Hawk," before launching into a discussion about their significantly reduced listenership following their removal from DirecTV.  Eric Logan (Elo), a frequent guest and their boss, joined the show.  Logan explained their absence the previous day was due to severe traffic delays in Boston following their road show, which coincided with the Boston Marathon.  The conversation then explored the differences between the Boston and New York City Marathons, including the quirks of the Boston Marathon's bus system for exhausted runners.

The hosts and Logan then dissected the unexpected removal of their show from DirecTV, speculating that it wasn't purely a programming decision but might be related to their show's content. Logan confirmed DirecTV's decision to switch to all-music programming, replacing them with Liquid Metal and The Torch (a Christian rock channel). This prompted a debate about Christian rock, featuring several callers, some angry about the DirecTV situation, others criticizing or defending the Music Lab channel (a jam band channel), and one sharing a humorous story about being a roadie for a Christian rock band.  The hosts played and mocked a Pillar song ("Fireproof"), adding more homophobic and religiously insensitive commentary.  The segment concluded with continued ridicule of Christian rock and a search for a Weird Al Yankovic parody of "The Devil Went Down to Georgia."

The next segment started with a discussion of jam bands, contrasting their extended improvisations with the hosts' preference for shorter songs.  This transitioned into a critique of Santana's guitar solos, followed by a discussion of Pearl Jam's recent SNL appearance and Eddie Vedder's perceived "douchebaggery."  A caller, Bruce, mentioned a cover band altering lyrics to add religious themes.  The hosts then praised the realism of "Lucky Louie," leading into a profane performance of a listener-submitted song, "The Devil Went to Jamaica," about the devil's cannabis use, by "Nude Beach George."  A pre-recorded Stephen Lynch song about Satan was played.  Callers Mike and Jimmy contributed, with Jimmy complaining about online community drama involving "cock blocking."  The hosts then mocked their overly formal bathroom break procedure.

The birth of Suri Cruise and a tabloid report claiming Tom Cruise wanted full custody in case of separation sparked a discussion about the report's plausibility and included speculation about Cruise potentially eating the placenta (a caller mentioned this rumor).  The hosts also humorously reviewed the New York Post's "Top Six Things Suri Holmes Cruise Has to Look Forward To" list and praised their headline: "Subway Jerk Off the Hook."  A caller criticized their humor, leading to self-deprecating remarks.  The segment ended with a discussion of a Roosevelt Island tramway incident where passengers were stranded for eleven hours.

The following segment opened with a humorous discussion about the geography of Roosevelt Island and its access via different bridges, highlighting the hosts' initial confusion.  They recounted their own experience being stuck on the Roosevelt Island tram, describing the reactions of fellow passengers, including children.  The discussion included misidentification of East River islands (Roosevelt, Ward's, and Randall's Islands) and their history as locations for the institutionalized and diseased. A caller mentioned the movie *Dark Waters*, filmed on Roosevelt Island.  A prank call about green diarrhea followed, leading to vulgar jokes.  A TV commercial for bathing suits was played, accompanied by crude commentary.  Author Ryan Ners, author of *Eat This*, called in late, leading to a humorous and insulting exchange before a more serious discussion about competitive eating.  More callers, some relevant, some offensive, followed, including further prank calls.  The segment ended with a discussion of a *House* episode featuring anal bleeding and a colonoscopy.

The final segment heavily featured criticism of the New York Mets' new theme song, "Our Team, Our Time," with the hosts and callers mocking its corniness.  This was followed by discussion of the documentary "Lady Di Cribs," about a homeless former Budweiser employee struggling with alcoholism, including graphic details of her lifestyle and sexual encounters.  General Bam and Sergeant Magoo, credited with the documentary, participated.  Callers debated helping Lady Di.  The hosts also discussed a video showing a brutal assault on a Las Vegas casino security guard and the lack of racial commentary in the news coverage.  A caller's anecdote about disruptive children at a baseball game concluded this part.

The final few minutes included jokes about a person with short arms and a reference to a midget comedy show.  Callers shared what they'd learned from the show, including vulgar and offensive statements, racist comments, and a discussion on whether deep-fried cannibalism counts as cannibalism. The broadcast concluded with an announcement of upcoming appearances at Caroline's.

[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  I love when Hawk fucks up.  Shut up.  But more importantly, we see Derek's balls.  You just relax. Here comes the funny.  Problem, Hawk?  My cross is burning so bad.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver, let's get the show on the road.  Every single morning.  Every single morning.  He's a fag.  He's a fag.  He's a fag. 
[00:05:00]  Nobody's got eggs.  Would you kindly shut your noise hole?  Oh, you like that, don't you faggot?  He's a fag.  He's a fag.  Nobody's got eggs.  Nobody's got eggs.  Nobody's got eggs.  You're going to be okay.  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch and I bet you'd like to suck.  Mama.  Mama.  Oh, mother fucker. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Good morning and welcome to the O.P. and Anthony program.  Hi there.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Actually, the O.N.A. virus took a major hit.  Why?  We're off DirecTV.  We've got to get into that sometime today.  Oh, boy.  This is a virus spreading across America.  And every once in a while, they find one of those vaccinations or something. 
[00:06:00]  There was a virus spreading across America, but House found a cure.  O.N.A., we're bleeding from the rectum.  I'm hearing all sorts of rumors about the DirecTV thing.  Yeah.  Right off the bat, we've got to get Elo on the phone.  Where's Elo?  Oh.  Because a lot of the pests aren't believing that XM had nothing to do with it.  Yeah.  And I'm a bit suspicious.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Are you a bit suspect?  I'm just a little suspect. 
[00:06:30]  Yes.  So we've got to get Eric Logan on the phone, get the official statement from XM Satellite Radio.  We were trying to explain this in front of like three, four hundred drunks.  Well, I think anything that we said at our little road show there in Boston that was of any importance has to be repeated today.  Oh, yeah.  Because I have no clue what was heard.  Yeah, well, we'll get into that.  But, you know, we like this O&A virus thing, and we took a huge hit.  Huge hit. 
[00:07:00]  A lot of people listened on DirecTV.  We were getting a lot of emails and feedback and stuff from people that said they woke up, popped it on their TV, and that's how they got their fix.  Well, we've got to go right to the phones.  One of our biggest fans, and he happens to be our boss, Eric Logan.  Eric.  Morning, boys.  How are you, sir?  Good morning, Elo.  Hi.  How are you guys doing?  Good.  And yourself?  I'm good.  Welcome back.  You made it back safely, apparently.  Yes, we did.  Yeah, the first phone call, and the guy hung up, unfortunately.  He goes, why did you guys have to take yesterday off? 
[00:07:30]  Boston's only like three and a half hours away.  Yeah.  I asked myself that question.  It's a great question.  And I hate to admit it, because like anyone else out there, I'm lazy like anyone else, but I was wondering, like, what are we doing?  I think I talked to you seven times yesterday or something.  It was like, what should we do?  I mean, we just put our conversations on the air.  I don't know the radio.  I'll tell you why.  I was going to leave.  I was actually going to leave and come back, but I couldn't get my car.  You can't get out there because of the marathon. 
[00:08:00]  You can't get out of there because of the marathon until, like, if you want to leave at six, that's fine.  But now, you know, you're stuck in traffic.  What time are you getting home?  It took me three hours to get home, and I left at 10 in the morning, which is great.  You leave at a different time, it's going to take you five hours.  We've got to explain.  Yes, the Boston Marathon ran right by our hotel.  Yeah.  Right by our hotel.  Sounds like a scheduling issue.  And what's great about the Boston Marathon, you know, because we've got the New York City.  Well, we've got the New York City possible deaths. 
[00:08:30]  I'll tell you what's great about it, and you'll be with me on this.  The New York City Marathon happens every year, obviously, in the fall, and the Boston Marathon is in the spring.  New York City Marathon, they let these idiots run for a week straight.  Oh, right.  You get the real runners, you know, trying to do something for themselves and accomplish, you know, personal goals.  And, you know, six, seven hours into it, you've still got a few stragglers that are still really trying.  After that, you've got the homeless. 
[00:09:00]  You've got everyone else that just should not be in the race.  Stalker Patty's pushing her cart down Central Park.  Of course.  You know, you should be â€“ you should have some type of skills if you're going to run a marathon.  Absolutely.  But the New York City Marathon, they allow everybody in.  So then, you know, the city's fucked up for a week because then you've got somebody with, you know, crutches and MS that has to prove some stupid point.  And doesn't every TV station cover, like, the last runner to come across?  Oh, very happy moment.  And leave it â€“  Like, here's the last one. 
[00:09:30]  It's like, are you kidding me?  Great.  And leave it to me.  I was the one that noticed every fucking year at the New York City Marathon.  It's the same lady finishing last because she's an attention-getting whore.  Yeah, Cindy Sheehan.  It was a lady that, you know, unfortunately, she dealt some bad cards.  A few bad cards.  And she's got the MS.  And that's horrific, obviously.  But every year she has to, you know, make sure she's in last place to get a little attention. 
[00:10:00]  So people could walk the 26 miles and actually get there faster.  But this is what bothers me, and this is where I guess I'm more twisted than the average person.  Like, she slows down on purpose to make sure she's last, to make sure she's on TV.  And there's something about that that really bothers me.  How do you feel about immigration?  I'm for the immigration.  Well, it was like you were saying the other day, Elo, about how the Jews are controlling it.  That was a good point.  So here's the point I want to make really fast. 
[00:10:30]  New York City Marathon, they let you run for days, and it's just like, all right, enough already.  I was watching the Boston Marathon outside, right from my window, just checking, you know, looking down and checking out the Boston Marathon.  Hours went by with just a stream of people, stream of people.  About the six-hour mark, more or less, maybe six and a half hours into the official race, all of a sudden I see just a ton of school buses filled with runners.  Yeah.  Did a little research. 
[00:11:00]  If you're still on the course six-plus hours in, tough shit.  But they have school buses, and they pick you up.  Oh, they pick you up and get you off the road.  And they say, well, you just weren't good enough to finish the race in the allotted time.  Get on the school bus.  Bravo.  And they were picking up people right outside our hotel.  And guess what?  The people right outside our hotel only had one mile to go.  Didn't matter.  Didn't matter.  Get off.  Race is over.  We got to open the streets back up.  You know what else I noticed they did?  They were just picking up random black people in those buses, too, in Boston, and just driving them out of the city. 
[00:11:30]  That's a great excuse.  Where's the finish line?  Right here.  It says, welcome to Connecticut.  So I guess that's the official excuse why we didn't do a show yesterday, because the Boston Marathon prevented us from getting our cars and driving home.  I got to thank.  Of course, it gets the bigger question about why you were in Boston to begin with, but that's a whole different time.  Yeah, well, Elo, you got to tell everyone.  I know we had some heavy conversations yesterday, but you got to tell these guys what I asked you yesterday. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, so I'm talking to Opie.  I can't remember if it was the seventh or eighth time I talked to him throughout the day.  He said, he goes, so, Elo, why exactly were we in Boston yesterday?  And, you know, I paused for a minute, and I said, well, if I can give you the answer, albeit probably the wrong answer, I can tell you.  And he said, sure.  I said, well, last year, if you remember, we went up there because it was Patriot Day, Boston Marathon, and it was opening day of baseball with Yankees and Red Sox. 
[00:12:30]  Right.  You know, and we're, you know, Anthony and Jimmy are big Yankee fans.  Yeah, so it made all the sense in the world.  Yeah.  So we just put it on the calendar.  You know, oh, let's go up.  Patriot Day kind of was the day.  So it got thrown on the calendar.  It goes through.  Go up there.  Oh, we'll do Patriot Day.  It's what we did last year.  Bill's Bar, the whole thing.  It'll be great.  Well, you know, you get up there.  It's a Boston Marathon.  A, it's not opening day of baseball anymore.  B, the Yankees have a travel day.  They're in Toronto and then get, you know, blown out last night.  Boston's there, albeit a great game. 
[00:13:00]  Nobody really cared about the Mariners coming to town.  It just happened to be a game at Fenway.  Wasn't even the opening day at Fenway.  So we were just kind of there out of habit.  And I was in a hotel rotting for like three days going, man, I have so much stuff to do back in New York.  Why am I here?  Why are we here?  I'm here for three days.  We lived in Boston.  I like going to Boston.  So it wasn't about that.  And then I'm thinking, all right, well, we'll get something accomplished here in Boston.  And then I'm thinking, there was no reason whatsoever to be at Bill's Bar and Broadcast Line. 
[00:13:30]  You know what I didn't like about it?  It was the third day in my suite.  The turndown service was late.  And I wanted to turn in.  And the maid hadn't come in and turned down my bed yet.  So I didn't care for that.  Damn.  Wow.  So, you know, you're thinking, well, all right, we're literally right next to Fenway, the green monster.  All right, maybe we'll get some Boston Red Sox players on the air.  Or maybe somebody from Major League Baseball.  Maybe a hot dog vendor from Fenway.  Something that makes it sound like we're doing something up there. 
[00:14:00]  Didn't do that.  Like Tom Brady of Patriot.  They're not doing anything, right?  The football players?  Yeah.  We didn't have any guests, really, except for Buck Cherry that just happened to be in town anyway.  And let's be honest, I like the guys, but they're not a huge guest.  It's not like Terry Francona walked over there or anything.  We had no Boston personalities.  No.  That's what it was.  And then I'm looking at the crowd, and, you know, we love our fans.  And I saw a lot of people from the Boston area that stopped by to say hi.  But half the room was from New York.  They road tripped. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, they drove up.  So I'm like, well, we could have done this in a local bar, you know, right outside the studio here.  And not taking two days to do it.  And then you got people bitching about they hate our live shows.  Yeah, a lot of people don't like the live show.  But you know what's really true?  I got the people who didn't like your live shows.  I got so many emails because we only replayed the live show one time.  You know, I think a forwarder, you wanted an email.  The guy's like, I'm canceling my subscription.  Well, that was a decision Ant and I made.  We're like, we're not really sure the live shows are our best work. 
[00:15:00]  So we don't really want it running all day.  So we'll repeat it once and then that's it.  You know?  Yeah, then I get all the pests that email me that says, like, you know, it's 6 o'clock in the afternoon.  This is atrocity.  It's not what I signed up for.  Dude, I want to complain more.  Why don't you play it again so I can talk about how bad the live shows are?  Yeah, I know.  That's exactly right.  And I got to tell you, the Boston live show is one of our better ones.  I had no problem with it.  And I think it's a cool little peek into what happens when we hit the road. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, I think it's great.  But, I mean, you asked the question why you were there and I don't have a really good answer.  Yeah.  Other than the fact it was sort of habit, which is the wrong answer.  There was some fun stuff that was happening at that show.  It was funny.  I got to thank Opie, by the way, for telling the listeners what hotel we were staying at.  Did you get a call, Opie?  Not a one.  I got a call.  Not a one.  I went back to the room.  Figured I'd go to sleep, which was not going to happen because outside my window. 
[00:16:00]  You know those things, those foam things that people smack together at football games?  Yeah.  Dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk.  I got that and yeah, yeah.  For three straight hours.  For three hours as people ran by.  Applauding a marathon is ridiculous.  That's right.  It's ridiculous.  Unless Christopher Reeve runs by.  There you go.  He deserves a smattering. 
[00:16:30]  Of course.  But I'm trying to get to sleep.  All those people get to be stars for a day.  Yeah, they do.  Even though they're running by and you're like, oh my God, without training I can beat you.  But isn't a marathon watching like the worst spectator sport in the world?  Oh, how boring.  How boring until, you know, your little Susie runs by or something.  I mean, my wife runs marathons.  I go out and watch her.  I get why you go ahead and run around and go watch your wife run by.  I got that.  But other than that, there's like, there's no point.  I actually, I actually punched one of those balloons out of an older couple's hand and 
[00:17:00]  it almost floated away, but I couldn't stand it anymore.  We got, I actually went to the game and then after the game, we're walking back to the  hotel and the lead runners were about to run by our hotel.  I'm like, that's got to be freaking cool to check out, you know?  And they got the media truck and stuff with all the cameras and the motorcycle cops.  It's a 90 pound Kenyans.  The guy, the guy set a Boston Marathon record.  He was darker than night.  Yeah. 
[00:17:30]  He was, he was scary dark.  And his body type was like the thing that crawled out of the ship in Close Encounters with  the big long arms.  See the size of his arms and legs?  He looked like he...  And Richard Dreyfuss is at the finish line with his arms open or something.  Oh, come on.  That was good.  Damn it.  No, it wasn't.  I actually didn't hear.  Was that a Whose Life Is It Anyway reference?  No.  Jimmy.  You're not paying attention.  What was it, I missed it.  Close Encounters. 
[00:18:00]  But what was the line though?  I'm not going to get another car crash.  I'm not going to get it backwards.  I'm not stupid.  Damn.  I thought you were going to get him.  Anyway, so I'm in the hotel.  I finally get to sleep.  Yeah.  And the phone rings.  And I, you know, all groggy.  I pick up the phone and I hear, Mr. Kumia?  Yes?  Yes, this is room service?  I, like, stop for a minute.  I'm like, room service. 
[00:18:30]  I didn't order any.  Ramon!  Get this man a cup of jizz.  Click.  Like, thanks, you motherfucker.  Did you unplug your phone at that point?  No.  I laughed my ass off and left the phone on just in case somebody else called.  But he was the only one.  And it really, even though it woke me up, I was laughing my ass off.  Because I'm like, room service?  I didn't order.  Ramon!  Oh, no. 
[00:19:00]  All right.  So, anyway, so really fast, there was this older couple, as I was watching the lead runners  go by, and they were planting themselves for the next three hours because I guess their  daughter or somebody was running.  Yeah.  And they wanted to make sure they, you know, showed their support, and they had this balloon  that was like, good luck, and big, huge signs.  And it was a windy day, and the balloon keeps hitting me in the head.  Oh.  And I'm like, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk.  And they don't care because they're just proud to be there with their stupid balloon. 
[00:19:30]  So I finally just went, blam!  And they gave me a look like, what the hell is your problem?  How could you not be excited?  And I'm like, the balloon's hitting me in the face.  Can you please, you know, do something about it?  Hilo's didn't work.  Yeah?  No, absolutely.  He's typing in the background.  I am, I'm replying to pests in real time.  Nothing, nothing.  He's telling stories, and Hilo, yeah, nothing says boring story like, like hearing typing 
[00:20:00]  in the background.  Hearing typing, that's the new thing.  As you're trying to impress your boss.  No, I'm just dealing with a little anecdote from your Boston trip.  That may make a few people laugh.  Did Hilo take Poison?  All right.  What are you typing?  Well, no, John K.  Haring's yelling at me because of Music Lab going down.  Because Music Lab was the greatest channel in the world, and I have to, and everybody's  copy and pasting the XM fan and 401s telling me how much of an idiot I am and how I should  be trying to radio.  Tell him Music Lab stunk. 
[00:20:30]  No one listened to it.  No one was listening to Music Lab.  It's always the best station ever when you take it off, isn't it?  Oh, yeah.  No one listens when it's on, but then you take it off.  Oh, my God.  Best station ever.  Yeah.  Dead last meeting.  Two guys.  Nobody listened to it.  Yeah.  Two guys call up saying it's the best station ever.  Well, actually, what happens is it's four people who post something on the fan sites,  and then they call all their friends, and they email everybody in the company.  It turns into a seven-hour meeting about how we're destroying the platform. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, well, anyway, the reason you're on the air, DirecTV, what's going on, Eric Logan?  Well, DirecTV...  That was a huge get for the Opie and Anthony show.  We were exposed to millions and, well, millions of people.  It was a big get for the company, too.  Well, what DirecTV did is they went to an all-music.  Their subscribers were all-music from DirecTV.  That's what they had before.  So they had Major League Baseball, home plate, and they also had high voltage.  So what they did is they wanted to go back to an all-music offering, 
[00:21:30]  and so they dropped all-talk channels.  Whose decision was this?  DirecTV's, without question.  Now, why did they decide in the first place to put on some talk programming?  And we know that our show is doing well, so it had nothing to do with people that were tuning in or anything.  Why, then?  Well, the reason why it was put on, I forced the issue, to be really frankly candid with you,  about putting on talk channels because I said this is a totally different offering than you've ever offered before 
[00:22:00]  because they had music choice before.  So they put them on, and they got, apparently, people who just wanted music channels,  and they have their research, and they have their reasons,  and, you know, they're really the client in this situation,  and they're saying, this is the channels that we want, and we're like, okay.  They told me they were going to drop it, and I said,  I really would strongly reconsider that for a lot of reasons, you know, of which we know why.  And they said, well, you know, this is what we want to do.  We want to replace it with Music Lab and replace it with The Torch.  And I'm like...  Oh, The Torch, yes.  We got replaced by Music Lab?  And The Torch. 
[00:22:30]  No, I'm sorry, Liquid Metal, not Music Lab, Liquid Metal.  Well, I'll tell you what it was all about, Elo.  I'm pretty hip.  It was a great way for them to advertise what was going on.  They wanted us to go on and plug their product for a while.  We did, knowing damn well that in time they were going to pull us off of there.  But we were silly, and we gave them a lot of publicity,  got a lot of people listening to it, watching it, whatever, signed up. 
[00:23:00]  And then bye-bye.  Those same people can come out, too, though.  You know, that's the thing.  Those same people don't have to continue to pay.  Yeah, but they will.  Who makes the decision over there?  It's the president of DirecTV, huh?  Yeah, there's like a head of programming and a head of consumer affairs.  There's a bunch of people over there.  It's 1-800-DIREC-TV.  Those are the...  Like, if we have listeners who kind of might want to get the thing put back on,  that's who they call?  That is their customer service number, I think, yeah.  1-800-DIREC-TV.  1-800-DIREC-TV. 
[00:23:30]  So do you think that there's one or two guys that, you know,  weren't happy with what they were hearing from our show?  No, actually, I talked to the head of programming.  I don't think that's the case at all.  But it doesn't make sense.  It really was a music decision.  They could just bury it in the middle of the channels.  No one would even know.  It would still be, like, mostly music.  Well, they wanted it all to be music.  That was their choice.  And there was a few problems.  I bet you someone had a problem with the content. 
[00:24:00]  Guaranteed.  They flipped it on.  They heard something they didn't like.  And they're like, why?  Baseball is probably so many channels, or is there only one channel?  It's just one channel.  Baseball was home plate.  It was 175.  It was the talk channel.  I got the same issue from the baseball fans, by the way.  I'm very suspicious.  I think someone had a problem with our content,  and they don't want to, you know, come out and say that.  Yeah, because it would go against what they do as a business.  They wanted all music.  I'm telling you what they told me.  Then they're really stupid. 
[00:24:30]  If we're a successful channel for them,  and they'd yank us just because they wanted to be all music,  that's just not smart business.  Yeah, that's like me saying I want to have all music,  and I'll take it off the air at XM.  Right.  Let's say hi to Jason in Jersey.  Jason, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  So I called DirecTV the other day.  Since I found out you guys were off the air,  the first lady I talked to denies your channel even existed.  Then she hung up on me.  I finally called back and talked to somebody else who knows what's going on.  Says I'm the first person I called up. 
[00:25:00]  He didn't know nothing about it.  And he tells me if I want to listen to you guys,  go buy XM Radio from the store.  And they gave me XM's website.  Hey, how about that?  All right, Jason.  Thanks.  See you.  Well, we definitely want the Pest to get involved.  1-800-DIREC-TV, right?  Yeah.  And is there email addresses and stuff?  Bet there are.  All right.  Well, I guess they'll be on whackbag.com or something like that.  Yeah.  We're not happy.  This is ridiculous.  It was a great get for the show, and now it's gone. 
[00:25:30]  The virus isn't as strong today.  Oh, I think it's strong.  Someone took some airborne or coldies.  Plushed it out.  Someone discovered penicillin.  Oh, no.  Someone discovered the penicillin.  Setback for the virus.  Ooh.  Oh, well.  Well, that's the truth.  I promise you.  There was a time polio was very important. 
[00:26:00]  Mm-hmm.  Right.  A lot of people feared polio.  That's right.  Now, hopefully we're one of those superbugs.  Yeah, we'll mutate.  Superbugs?  Hopefully we'll mutate and we'll be a superbug.  Yeah.  Where you got to get the stronger penicillin to get rid of this.  Absolutely.  All right, Elo.  Anything else?  No, I'm going to go pretend I'm important now.  Oh.  Good idea.  I'm going to go back to typing.  It makes me look smart.  Somebody is angry that Torch is off XM.  What was Torch? 
[00:26:30]  Torch was Christian Rock.  Oh.  So we got replaced by that and the Music Lab on...  And you don't think it's a content issue?  They took Opie and Anthony off and put Christian Rock on?  No, no, no.  They took Opie and Anthony off and put up liquid metal.  I think you were replaced technically by liquid metal.  Jackson.  Jackson.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, Elo, I got to bitch at you for a second because you took the Torch off the air and  I'm not, like, I know this might sound like a joke, but I really like that station and  there's nothing else on the platform like it and then you put... 
[00:27:00]  You know why?  Because Christian Rock stinks.  Yeah, nobody wants to hear the Lord.  Do you want this awful one?  I like that.  Yeah.  No, let him finish.  I mean, he's going to make a good point.  Jackson, why don't you come in and just listen to regular Rock?  Exactly.  Christian Rock blows.  And you know what?  The Pope came out and said, all rock means you're going to hell.  Exactly.  So even you Christian rockers out there that think you're safe where you're...  Think you're going to slip into heaven.  Where you're rocking and you're still going to go to heaven, man.  No, you're not, according to the Pope.  No, no, but see, understand, I replaced the Torch with Southern Gospel. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, wow, that's different.  That's my problem, Elo.  You already had a Gospel-type station on there, but you also put on two more hit channels.  And if I have to, you know, there's no reason to have another station that's going to play  Gold Digger 15 times an hour.  Well, one of those stations is adding commercials, by the way.  So there's a reason why we did that.  Jackson, we could all agree, though.  Christian Rock just stinks.  What's your favorite Christian Rock song, Jackson?  Excellent.  Yeah, give us your favorite...  Hold on, hold on.  Give us your favorite Christian Rock song. 
[00:28:00]  Jimmy's on to something here.  All right.  Pull up Fireproof by Pillar.  All right.  What is Fireproof all about?  You got something to do in Not Going to Hell because you're Christian?  Fireproof.  Right.  No, it's just about the fact that because he believes in God and because he accepted  Christ into his life, he's fireproof.  He's not going to hell.  I just said that.  What's that other Christian Rock song?  I'm a fucking boring motherfucker.  But I got Jesus in my heart.  No one wants a rock star who's not going to hell.  Right. 
[00:28:30]  So make you a rock star.  What do you do?  Go on the road and...  I don't care.  What do you do?  Straighten up hotel rooms when he's on the road?  Vacuums.  Right.  Those are the windows.  No, no, no.  He's been listening.  I've got a lot of emails about the Torch, by the way.  I did.  I mean, it was a tough...  It's not a great station.  It's not a great station.  It is.  Zip it.  All right.  It is.  Sorry.  Zip it.  Zip it.  All right.  Goodbye, sir.  I won't zip it because I'm not fireproof.  He's going to go to H-E-Double Hockey Sticks with language like that.  Oh, easy.  Now we've got to listen to this song. 
[00:29:00]  Elo, you hang with us or not?  I'll hang with you.  I've got the head of our sales department in here trying to make you guys some money.  We've got to do a business meeting.  Ah.  I don't even know that guy's name.  All right.  Here we go.  It's Pillar and Fireproof.  Sounds a little demonic.  Yeah.  You're not going to heaven playing this.  I don't care what the words are.  No.  I'm not going to the Rocksville Hall of Fame either.  This is hell music. 
[00:29:30]  Here's a chance to show you how I feel.  Ah.  Chance for you to see it's real.  See just what I feel inside of you.  It isn't by my side.  Then I will never change my mind.  Try to torch me and you'll find.  You can't turn me or deter me.  No matter how you try.  You're boring.  Exactly. 
[00:30:00]  What does this sound like?  This is not his sound.  He stole it.  You know what this song needs?  Lyrics about pussy.  And then it went rock.  Gah-gah-gah-gah-gah-gah-gah-gah-gah-gah-gah-gah-gah-gah.  Now you know what I'm more proud. 
[00:30:30]  There's a chance I'll ever drown.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh! 
[00:31:00]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  I'm sure we still be an Anthony program. We're fireproof. Oh, that's funny. Give me those ribs. Oh, man. We're not Christian rock. There you go. I am fireproof. Ugh. Do they have groupies and stuff? Christian rockers? Probably a bunch of nuns. They do have groupies? Yeah. Remember Petra? Petra had a lot of groupies. Remember what? Petra. Petra? Exactly. No one. Huge Christian rock group. How big is huge for Christian rock, though? 
[00:31:30]  Yeah. Ten thousand albums, I'm sure. Petra? Yes. Look it up. Are you one of those Christians? I'm knowledgeable about Christian rock. Is that why you have your hair do like that? That's like rebellious for Christian rock. It's the Christian rock look. Right. I never got the Christian rock movement. I got to tell you. I actually never got the Christian movement. That's a whole other show. 
[00:32:00]  Fireproof. All right. I'm going to go pretend I'm important, boys. All right. Do that. Bye, Mr. Logan. There's Mr. Logan. Christian rock really bugs me. It's like, look, why don't you stop it already? If you want to be a good Christian, good for you. Get out of rock. Don't show people you can still have fun after you give your life to Christ. No, you can't. 
[00:32:30]  And they asked the Pope about the rock music, and he says, listen to rock music. And then they kind of asked him about the Christian rock. He says, same thing. It doesn't matter. It's still rock and roll.  Did he mention what happens to an organization for kind of covering up pedophilia and shipping pedophiles to other parishes? Did he mention what happened to them?  You go to heaven, and everything's fine. Yeah, you can't put a wolf in sheep's clothing. That's right. By having a hard rock band singing about Jesus. 
[00:33:00]  Let's go to Dave. Dave? Yeah, you guys are hypocrites. Yeah. All right. We sure are. Why, man? We are hypocrites. Hold on. Sorry, please.  If you like the content, it should go off. I mean, it's the same. People said the same thing about you guys.  Hey, wait a minute.  We ran rave about content.  Hold on.  Hold on. Hold on. Hold on, Dave.  We said what to who?  Dave.  Yeah.  My opinion is that Christian rock sucks. I never said it shouldn't be on XM. 
[00:33:30]  That was me who said that.  Did we say take it off?  You guys just said get rid of the station.  Yes. Who?  We meant it.  Did we say that?  Yeah.  But do it. We're talking about it.  I'm pretty sure you did.  It's the same thing.  This is not a content.  Bro, bro. It's not a content judgment issue.  And like, people own it. You can't deny are popular.  I mean, is the show vile to some? Yes.  But you can't deny it's popular.  Christian rock, as far as compared to certain music genres, it's popular, yeah, but not popular compared to others. 
[00:34:00]  And I realize it didn't make much sense.  I'm not a Christian rock fan, so I mean, I'm not...  I can't imagine there's a huge fan base for Christian rock and a huge fan base for the Music Lab channel.  And you guys, no matter what it is, should back that.  Dude, here's...  Back it.  No, we're not saying it should be taken off because of the statements they're making and it's religious and stuff.  How about Just Cause It Stinks?  O&A rule, Christian rock sucks.  That's the rule of thumb.  You are not hang-up proof, Dave. 
[00:34:30]  Dave, you like the Christian rock?  I don't. I don't. Not at all.  Are you fireproof, Dave?  How bad did that song sound?  It sounded like...  I go to church on Easter and Christmas, and that's about it.  It sounded like all the C-level bands from the 80s.  Awful.  Yeah.  You know, you had the ones that were making it, and then all the other ones that almost made it all had that same sound.  And that was it.  All right.  Well, I like someone who...  You guys, after all the shit that you guys take, that you would be a little bit more defenders of...  You know, just... 
[00:35:00]  We're not.  No, we're not.  We're not.  It's all about us.  Absolutely.  In the end.  Stink.  All right, Dave.  Thanks.  Bye.  Yeah.  Christian rock.  You're a bunch of groupies.  I'm going to have that stuck in my head now all day.  Exactly.  What do they do when they show?  What happens in the groupies community dressing room?  What do you do?  Like, just talk about the Lord?  I think they do that thing.  Awful.  You get into rock your whole life, you want to get laid.  That's why you get into a band.  You got long hair.  Yeah.  And you can't make it because you suck.  And you finally get a bunch of religious people that go, oh, these guys are nutty. 
[00:35:30]  These guys are crazy.  And your groupies don't even bang.  They probably break out the backgammon.  I think they're in the crowd doing that thing.  You ever see those religious shows where everyone puts their hands up in the air, they shut their eyes and look up, and they just kind of rock back and forth with that weird little zombie face?  I think that's what they do at those shows.  How about this, Christians?  And it's good that you do what you do.  Stop trying to have, like, Christian comedians. 
[00:36:00]  You're not fun people.  No.  Am I saying you're bad people or you're godless people?  But in the fun department, you come in behind rectal itch.  Once you devote your life to the Lord like that, you're pretty much making some sacrifices.  When's the last time you were on a date with a girl who said, my life has been given over to Christ, and you went, this is going to be a great date?  It's never followed with, ha-la-la-la-la.  No, not at all.  Unless she's talking in Babel.  Ha-la-la-la-la-la.  Well, he came to save me. 
[00:36:30]  Ha-la-la-la-la-la.  All right.  Sure.  Uh, Mike in Kentucky.  Mike.  Hey, what's up, boys?  What's up, Mike?  Hey, were you just talking shit about the Music Lab channel?  Yeah, yeah, we were talking shit.  We were talking smack.  Why?  That channel's, like, one of the best ones on XM, dude.  Explain why Music Lab is one of the best channels on XM.  Because-  Because I didn't like it.  I tried it.  Actually, it's not even around anymore, so it wasn't that good.  It's not around.  I did give it a shot, man.  I don't think so, right?  I think they got rid of Music Lab.  Why do you like it? 
[00:37:00]  Because I actually did try to listen to it, and I could not get into it.  I tried it.  I gave it a shot.  I'm not saying it shouldn't exist.  I just personally, myself, didn't enjoy it.  How long you listen to it?  All the time.  What did you actually like about it?  They played a lot of-  Because I always thought it was kind of distracting.  Actually, we do this for another 20 minutes.  It could be a hit on the Music Lab channel.  What's that?  Just put a beat behind it.  Yeah, just start playing a spoon in the background.  The interruption. 
[00:37:30]  No, Mike, seriously.  How could you possibly like the Music Lab?  Don't you ever-  You never listen to, like, the Grateful Dead or any band?  Of course.  No, who are they?  That's what the fucking Music Lab channel is, man.  It's a bunch of fucking jam bands.  No, because there's another channel for that stuff.  Yes.  Yeah, that's Music Lab.  Channel ZZZZZ.  I don't think you guys know what channel you're fucking talking about.  Yes, it's the channel that sounds like any band tuning, right?  Wait a minute. 
[00:38:00]  Isn't there another channel that's dedicated to, like, Fish, Grateful Dead?  Yeah, that's Music Lab.  String cheese incidents.  Another station.  Not Music Lab.  Shut up with the Music Lab.  I don't know if it's-  There is no other station.  I don't know if it's Music Lab.  If it is, then I gotta shut up, because every once in a while I enjoy a 30-minute Grateful  Dead song.  That's the only station.  That's all they play.  It's jam bands.  All right, you know what, dude?  I may need to be corrected, because I'm thinking of one-  Is the Music Lab is the one that-  Because I'm saying the Music Lab stinks.  Is the Music Lab the one that would play mostly, like, long, like, Fish songs, stuff like that? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  Okay, I was correct.  It does stink.  I thought Music Lab was, like, you know, Jethro Tull.  Everyone knows he can play the flute, but, yeah, he's in the lab experimenting, so he picks  up a ukulele and plays it for a half hour.  And it just goes off for a half hour.  Right.  Because it's a lab.  They don't play fucking Jethro Tull on the Music Lab.  No?  Is it really the place where they have all the jam bands? 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, bro.  It's like Fish, Moe, String Cheese Incident.  Exactly.  Who's enjoying that?  String Cheese Incident?  And what do they do?  It's like, how long is a song?  Could be 20 minutes sometimes?  No.  Nah, a lot longer.  They're usually longer.  A lot longer than one radio play.  And what is it?  Just them jamming.  Yeah.  So it's a lot of, like, just guitar leads.  And that is the worst music ever.  The most boring, self-serving shit. 
[00:39:30]  I'd rather listen to the background music in a Tawid and Jihad video as they're lopping  it off.  That music is more interesting to listen to than jam band stuff.  Which, by the way, we were listening to on the way back from Boston yesterday.  Yes, we were.  Ah.  I had XM Chill on for everybody.  Oh, really?  I had a carload of people and we had the XM Chill channel on.  Those bands are successful, man.  So somebody must be listening to them.  They are.  The Fish is a hugely popular band. 
[00:40:00]  I'm not denying that.  The Fish.  Yes, P-H-I-S-H.  I'm not saying that they're not popular.  All right.  I'm just saying that they shouldn't be.  Hey, turn it on when you guys get off and listen to it.  Ah, no.  Do we have any fish?  I'd give Fish a shot.  If we have any fish, I would give it a chance because I'm open-minded.  Well, the problem is it takes about 15 minutes for them to really get into their groove.  So do you want to sit here for 15 minutes?  No, we can just play it and go back to it.  All good jam bands know how to tune their instruments for 20 minutes. 
[00:40:30]  That's what it is.  And then all of a sudden you're like, oh, okay, they're getting into a groove here.  A big tuning session.  Right.  All right, boys, I'm punching out.  Bye, doll face.  All right, Mike.  Hey, y'all have a good one.  I enjoy the Grateful Dead show every once in a while.  Horrible.  I want to hear Fish.  And then you're like a newbie at the Dead concert and you just want to hear the hits.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, when are they going to play Touch of Grey and then someone just hits you because  they want to hear some 35, 40-minute jam?  It's like Touch of Grey.  They just started Space and Drum. 
[00:41:00]  Shut up.  Oh, they did?  Yeah, man.  Space and Drum.  I thought they were tuning.  For all the people that have dropped the acid.  This one's for you.  Awesome.  Watch.  Him who doesn't shave their pits dancing in a circle with filthy, filthy bare feet.  Dirty feet, hairy armpits.  That skirt with the hairy legs when they spin around.  The skirt billows up.  Yeah.  You just see the hairy legs.  The hair's all, like, wavering out.  Like, like, oh.  See, everyone is saying that Music Lab is a jam band channel.  A lot of fans of this program love the jam bands, I'm telling you right now. 
[00:41:30]  I'm sure they do.  Why?  But every time I tuned in that channel, to be fair, it was always some ridiculous thing.  I don't think I hear the dead on that channel.  I think I usually hear my dead on Deep Tracks.  Yeah.  It's usually, like I said, there was one time, and I keep going back to it, it was some Jethro  Tull mess, is the only way I could explain it.  Some song that was recorded and never heard until that moment. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, and I formed my opinion right then and there.  Yeah.  Because it was just Jethro Tull doing something he just shouldn't be doing.  I had no idea that it was all the jam bands, because I just gave up on that channel after  the Jethro Tull mess.  Touch up, Gray.  That is their best song.  Dead fans love to hear that, too.  Dead fans hate it.  No, they don't really.  They don't consider it the dead.  It's called Beginner Dead.  Exactly.  There's a whole thing within the dead community.  If you listen to that stuff, you're Beginner Dead, and they look at you like, oh, that's 
[00:42:30]  kind of cute.  That was like when Charlie Daniels was big in the 70s, and the devil went down to Georgia  that came out, and if you were a Charlie Daniels fan, that was it.  If anyone liked that song, they were assholes, because they didn't appreciate Charlie Daniels  before that.  I like that song, because the devil wanted to get a soul.  He couldn't get one, so he said, ah, let's have a fiddle contest.  I'll fiddle you for it.  Fiddle you.  And we all know how that ended.  That's right.  The devil got his ass kicked.  The devil did.  But that's the only way you can fight the devil with a fiddle. 
[00:43:00]  With a fiddle.  With a fiddle.  He wasn't fireproof.  Like the devil's not going to go after losing the fiddle fight.  You know something?  Go fuck it.  I'm the devil.  What, am I going to be a nice guy and go, well, you beat me.  I'm the devil.  So I'm just going to take it all anyway.  The fiddle is the devil's kryptonite.  Yeah.  Who would have thought?  The devil can't get you through your fiddle.  He's a scary mofo.  But in the middle of the night, when the devil comes for a visit, just make sure you've got  a fiddle nearby.  Not a fiddle!  He bows his head because he knew he lost. 
[00:43:30]  He knew that he'd been beat.  By some incest survivor.  And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at whose?  Johnny.  Johnny's feet.  Probably 380 pounds in gold.  And Johnny, what an asshole, he tells the devil, hey, you ever want to try again?  You know, come back.  I'll be here.  I done told you once.  I done told you once, you son of a gun.  Bitch.  It's an AM.  Why would you ever give the devil a second chance?  Exactly.  Hey, hey, come on back, mofo.  I'm a tough guy. 
[00:44:00]  I would think it'd be a hell of a fight.  It would have to be in an octagon or something.  You bet the fiddle a gold.  They forget the part after the devil lost.  He took that faggoty fiddle player and just raped him.  And why is the devil behind on getting souls?  Yeah.  What's happening?  You had to go to Georgia?  Exactly.  He wanted a stupid soul.  I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player.  Oh.  The devil has a hobby.  I also like to croquet.  Crochet. 
[00:44:30]  God damn it.  The devil's croqueting.  Might be a sin.  Well, that's confidence.  Everyone.  Yeah.  Good tune, though.  You don't like this?  You win, you get the gold.  But if you lose the devil, it's your soul.  Where are you going to sell a gold fiddle?  Yeah.  You know the asshole probably sold it for like 15 bucks at the pawn shop. 
[00:45:00]  Went to the bar.  Got to wrong.  Told his story.  No one believed him.  And they punched him in the face.  That's a sucker's bet, by the way.  Part two of this song.  That's a sucker's bet.  Of course it is.  I hate the fact that the devil had a band of demons.  Band of demons.  Big big red bus pulls up with fire coming out of it.  And who are the band of demons?  The band of demons gets horns.  The band of demons gets horns.  Don't make Satan out of me.  They're not good enough to be Satan himself.  No.  Look, they're in waiting. 
[00:45:30]  They're like the VPs.  And this guy's just got a, Johnny's just got a fiddle.  Right.  And, uh, devil, a whole band.  You can hear the bass and everything.  You think when he's playing the fiddle right now, it's blowing the devil's hair back?  Oh, yeah.  Like, oh, no.  He's looking good.  It's so hard to play the fiddle with cloven hooves.  You have to tape the fiddle thing to it.  Croquet.  Idiot.  Croquet.  When people finish, Johnny said, well, you're pretty good, old son.  Old son.  That was a compliment.  Let me show you how to do it.  Bad show.  Fire on the mountain, run, boys, run. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, well, he's kicking ass.  Do you really think the devil's sitting for this right now?  Yeah, the devil's sitting going, well, I think he's pacing back and forth going, all  right, I got my work cut out for me.  I think the devil says, I don't care if you're better.  I'm going to take your soul, because I always get it.  Because you're a human, because he always wins.  And who knows what happened after this.  This could have been in the late 30s, where the devil got a little cranky at old Johnny and  said, you know what?  That fellow with the short mustache, let's put him in charge for a while.  Yeah, you might have just pissed off the devil. 
[00:46:30]  Now he humbled him.  He bowed his head because he knew that he was beat.  Oh, boy.  He was shucks.  He laid that golden fiddle on the ground.  Why not could he hand it to him?  Johnny said, devil, just come on back if you ever want to try again.  I done told you once, you son of a bitch.  Oh, wow.  Hey, Charlie.  The kids are listening, Charlie.  Devil's in the house of the rising sun.  Yeah.  And he gives the devil a little encore.  But he even has a devil song.  Just for that occasion. 
[00:47:00]  What are the odds of having a devil song ready?  And if you beat the devil, would you really give him an encore?  No.  I think you pick up the golden fiddle and get the fuck out of, dog.  I think at this point you should be humble, pick up the golden fiddle, and just walk away.  Don't tempt him.  Don't tempt him.  Because, I mean, you've got to regroup when you lose, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They come up with a new strategy.  No fiddle playing.  Now he's going to be like, I'm going to golf.  I'll go to the golf course and bet someone a golden putter.  I'll bet you didn't know it, but I'm a golfer, too. 
[00:47:30]  The hat's all turned sideways.  Oh, that kind.  Which way is hell?  Hey, let's go to nude beach, George.  Ah, he laid the golden tiddlywinks at the ground at little Billy's feet.  He was really desperate.  He's just playing stupid games he can't possibly win.  Hey, devil, idiot, just take the salt.  Yeah, exactly.  Why don't you just play to your strengths?  Just play to your strengths like you used to.  I guess you break out the pitchfork and your fire. 
[00:48:00]  Right, stop poking the people in the ass, your mind.  Game fucking over.  He's playing that fiddle.  Just give him a blast of heat, devil.  I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a macrame or two.  Oh, I hadn't heard.  Pulls out his golden crochet hook and croquet mallet.  Makes a fine doily.  Johnny's like, oh, no.  Oh, boy, what am I going to do now?  You win a golden doily.  Devil's a douche.  He really is. 
[00:48:30]  This song is so bad.  I love that song, though.  I like the music.  You know the chicken in the bread pan.  You're picking out some dough.  You're picking out dough.  Chicken's going, why the devil's looking?  Why are we going?  What do you want from me?  Granny's in the middle going, what do you want from me?  No child, no.  I just want a plate of fillies getting fucking fresh.  Let's go to nude beach George.  What's up, fellas?  How are you?  What's up?  Hey, Hope, you remember who I am, man?  Long Island White House Beach, brother? 
[00:49:00]  Oh, Long Island White House Beach.  Of course.  Hell yeah.  Dude, what's up?  How you been?  What's up, bro?  All right, brother.  What's going on?  My wife says hello, too.  Very good.  Oh, yeah.  Wait a minute.  Don't tell me.  Don't tell me.  What's her name?  I don't want to say that on the air, bro.  I know what it is, though.  Tell her I said hi.  Well, I know she went blonde for you guys, too.  Yeah, right?  Absolutely.  What do you got, nude beach?  Hey, listen.  And there is the greatest parody of that song, which is, I think it's Weird Al Yankovic, and 
[00:49:30]  it's The Devil Went Down to Jamaica.  It's the greatest parody.  Oh, I bet it's so funny.  Is it funny?  Let's find that song.  Let's find that song.  Because Weird Al is so goddamn funny.  That guy's hilarious.  Now we got to find this song and see how great this song is.  Did you ever see, instead of Beat It, he sang Eat It?  I mean, he takes, like, the words.  He changes them, you know?  You know, I could still see that and just laugh.  You know, the song is so great that it's not in the master computer at XM. 
[00:50:00]  Master computer.  I lost on Jeopardy!  And you know how much crap XM has in its master computer?  A lot.  So to not be in this master computer, it just shows you the song.  I want to see Al Yankovic do a Bud Dwyer take and put his, and lost interest in that  one.  Yeah, you did.  You just lost complete interest.  Not even faith.  Interest.  I couldn't say the word parody.  I couldn't find it until I went, a Bud Dwyer thing, but without the word parody. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, Bud Dwyer parody.  Hey, Ope, you remember OBI?  It was the summer.  I remember it was hot.  Remember me?  Jesus Christ.  Miguel.  Yeah.  What's up?  Hey, guys, how's it going?  Hey, in high school, back in, like, 92, 93, I was a roadie for a Christian band.  Oh, get going back to the Christian rock thing.  It was, like, a hard-rocking Christian band.  Yeah.  And it was, y'all were mentioning groupies.  Well, we would, they would have some, but, yeah, they would, I'm not kidding, guys. 
[00:51:00]  They would have prayer in the back room after their little gigs.  Why?  Because you got to pray that you had a good gig.  Oh, God.  This is the funniest thing.  I don't remember all of the songs, but they would take, it was like a cover band, and they  would take, like, a normal song and, like, Christianize it.  Ah.  I know, exactly.  And I remember one of the songs, oh, man, it was hilarious.  It was a, it was a Slayer song, North, South of Heaven, and, of course, they changed it to 
[00:51:30]  North of Heaven.  Ah, yeah.  That's clever, you know?  Which way is north?  Yeah, and the funny thing is, you know, I'd be, you know, I'd be perched up against one  of the speakers, and, you know, of course, we'd be at a church revival or something, and  then, you know, it'd be a mix of age groups there, and I remember they'd be there jamming  out, you know, and you look out in the audience, and there's some old lady, old broads out there  just with their hands up in the air trying to rock, you know, trying to act like they 
[00:52:00]  completely understand where these guys were coming from.  Trying to act like they're not sitting in a diaper full of shit, a bunch of car tables  with that awful thin white cloth, but what's that little stuff, the thin plastic you put  on car tables for outdoors events?  You know what I'm talking about?  When you have, like, a chintzy car table, it's like a thin plastic table.  Oh, tablecloth?  Yeah.  And I would always catch on something and rip?  Yeah.  Yes.  That's exactly what, I don't know what it's called, a thin plastic tablecloth.  Yeah.  Anyway, do you guys have a great man? 
[00:52:30]  I work for FedEx, and we...  Uh, Spoon in Houston, what's going on?  Can you help it all, Dalton boy, Fata?  Hey, Spoon.  Hey, I want to back that guy up that just called a second ago about that devil went down  to Jamaica.  Yeah.  It's a pot song.  We know that.  It's like marijuana bill.  Well, that's terrific, but you know what?  We don't have a copy of the song, so we kind of got to end the Weird Al Yankovic discussion.  I don't want to end it, Opie.  I think he's funny.  Wait, what are you sending? 
[00:53:00]  Getting double went down to Jamaica.  Oh, terrific.  Thank God.  That's just horrific for everybody involved.  What did you get?  What did I get it from?  Douche.com?  Uh, well, we got a big jam band fan.  Oh, cool.  Keith calling from O-Town.  Bring it on, brother!  What's up, fellas?  Hi.  Hey, O-Town.  Hey, hey.  We don't want to piss you off.  You say whatever you want.  I know O-Town's tough.  I'm just going to comment on the Music Lab situation. 
[00:53:30]  Okay.  I'm a big jam band fan, but I think Music Lab actually sucked, to be honest with you.  But they didn't really play too much of jam band music.  See, I didn't have my info, because I'm like, the guy's saying it's a jam band channel.  I'm like, every time I tuned in, it didn't sound like a jam band channel to me.  It sounded like a lot of crazy experimentation going on.  Exactly.  Playing with test tubes, beakers.  But just to back up the jam band music, people categorize it as Grateful Dead, you know, laid 
[00:54:00]  back, but it's more of jazz, funk, and, you know, some laid back music.  So it's, you know, you've got to give it some respect.  I don't mind a jam every once in a while.  Every once in a while.  I can't listen to it all.  And by that, I mean none in a lifetime.  I can't listen to it all day long.  No.  It's the experience, though, too.  Like, if you're a Phish fan, you know.  All right.  Hey, thanks, bro.  I like hits. 
[00:54:30]  I like hits that last under three minutes.  That's what I like.  Under three?  Jesus.  That's it.  That's fantastic.  Make it quick, and that's it.  Make it a hit.  Catchy.  Something like that.  Something like it's heavy rotation, and you get sick of it.  That's what I like.  Are you on the crystal meth?  No, I like that.  Why do you like your music so quick?  I just, I like hits.  Yes.  And then after you're done, give me another hit.  You gotta smoke a joint and sit back, man.  No.  I want something I could sing the chorus to in the car, and then it's over, and there's 
[00:55:00]  another fun song after that.  I don't want to hear, like fucking Santana.  Shut up with that stupid guitar already.  He is always a black lady magic, really?  Black lady magic woman.  Whatever that dumb song he sings.  Got a black magic woman.  Oh, is he awful?  And then go into a 15-minute guitar solo.  That song hurts my back. 
[00:55:30]  It's so awful.  Call me for this.  I like a Santana character every once in a while.  I like nothing.  Even that big hitty head.  All right, let's be honest, because Ant's talking about the hits, right?  Yeah.  Thumbs up or down, stupid girl, pink?  No, no, no.  It's a little catchy.  It's catchy.  It's a little catchy.  I'm like, why do I like this?  Did you see SNL?  All right.  SNL over the weekend, did you see any of Pearl Jam?  Why would I watch SNL? 
[00:56:00]  Because Pearl Jam was on.  How were they?  I haven't got any.  It's a little weird, I'll tell you.  Sorry, go ahead.  A little odd.  I like the songs.  It sounds like Pearl Jam, a little updated, which is kind of cool.  It was weird to watch, though, because Pearl Jam hadn't really been in the public eye for a lot of years.  But they never went away.  They never went away, but you didn't see them.  It was an interesting band, because I just feel like they probably had more hits in them, but why didn't they go down the hit route? 
[00:56:30]  It felt like I was watching Eddie and the Cruisers 2.  Really?  It was kind of like Eddie Vedder is definitely older.  He's more mature looking.  Still got the same hair and everything, but you could tell in his face.  And then his band, Pearl Jam, they're not kids anymore.  Remember when you're used to seeing kind of like kids?  And I don't think they've replaced anybody.  I don't think so either.  I think it's the same band doing it and just loving life. 
[00:57:00]  Eddie sounds great.  Sounds just like he always did.  Didn't lose anything.  Same hair.  Hasn't changed his hair in years.  But just a little more, you know, weathered and mature.  He's a douche.  He might be.  He might have been then.  I don't know if he is now.  Why do you think he's a douche?  But I kind of liked it.  Because people say, well, he did the Ticketmaster thing, which was good.  But because I saw him accepting an award one time, and he goes, you know, you can't put art in a category.  How many years ago is this?  It doesn't matter.  That's who he is.  That's who he is.  Really?  You can't put art?  Yes, you can. 
[00:57:30]  What?  Is it a painting or is it a song?  Those are categories.  Why are those categories?  You just don't care.  So there shouldn't be a category.  So if you want a CD because it's under art, you should just go.  It's fucking potluck.  You reach into the old art bag.  And whenever you pull out, because it's art.  I want to listen to a song, but I'll have to look at the painting in my car.  Shut your face.  I wanted an independent film.  I got a collage.  I got a collage.  Let's go to Bruce in Louisiana.  You're going to love this one.  Bruce? 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, Jimmy, this will really piss you off.  That cover band that changes the words to make God songs.  Right.  They do Jesus, I'm coming home instead of Mama, I'm coming home.  Wow.  I actually like that, though, because hopefully it means that they're dying.  Oh, and Jimmy, one more thing.  I saw your Lucky Louie promo.  Good fucking line in there.  I laughed my ass off.  Thanks.  Bye.  Thank you.  What was the line?  You got to help us all out.  I keep missing the Lucky Louie promos.  I got to tell you, that looks like it's going to be a huge hit.  Of course it is. 
[00:58:30]  I love how they filmed it.  Yeah.  They're filming it like it's a sitcom, but it's very gritty looking.  Yeah.  You know, because you've seen every sitcom with the set.  It's cute.  Yeah.  It's so polished, right?  The Lucky Louie set is filmed in that same kind of manner with bright lights and everything,  but the apartment's a shithole.  And Jimmy's, so far, Jimmy's been featured in both promos.  But there's no laugh track.  It's real live.  And Louie would go out before the show and go, look, if you think it's funny, please,  we want you to laugh.  If you don't, don't laugh.  Don't fake it. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, that's good.  Yeah, it was great.  Real live audience.  Of course, shit.  No, no, no.  Even a lot of sitcoms have this big piece of plastic up.  Guys.  Yes, sir.  Great news.  Ooh.  Look what we found.  All right.  Let me sit down.  Put on your laughing hat.  The devil went to Jamaica.  He was looking to sell some weed.  He was doing fine.  They were standing in line.  It was excellent weed indeed. 
[00:59:30]  We came across a young man who was likewise peddling pot,  and the devil slid down the beach to the kid and said,  boy, let me tell you what.  I guess you've kind of figured I'm a reefer head, of course.  And after all this time, I guess that I'm a connoisseur of sorts.  Now, your stuff smells okay, but this could tranquilize a horse.  I've been a million in cash.  Against your stash, because I think mine's better than yours.  The boy said, my name's Johnny, and you ain't smoked nothing yet.  One hit of this grass will kick your ass.  You've got yourself a bit.  Johnny, roll a ball of hash and make sure it's the bomb. 
[01:00:00]  Because the devil's got the kind of stuff they smoked in Vietnam.  You'll get a million smackaroos in cash if you can cook.  But if you can't, the devil will get your dough.  Shut your goddamn pie hole.  The devil packed a bong with a little Acapulco gold and resin flew from his fingertips as he fired up his bowl.  He filled that chamber all the way and he took him out of here. 
[01:00:30]  And as they passed it back and forth, it gave them both a coffin pit.  When the bowl was finished, Johnny said, hey man, that stuff was great.  But fill your lungs with some of this and prepare to vegetate.  Cannabis sativa, sweet Mary Jane.  The devil's in the backyard frying his brain. 
[01:01:00]  Zig-zag filled with a diggity dank.  What?  Hold on tight, it'll hit you like a tank.  The devil nodded off because he knew that he was stoned.  And he asked if he could buy an ounce of the stuff that Johnny owned.  Johnny said, devil, just come on back if you ever want to catch a buzz.  I done told you once, you son of a bitch.  Mine's the best there ever was.  And they fired up doobies one by one. 
[01:01:30]  And they're gonna stop till the bag's done.  Green as a bullfrog, sticky-ass glue.  What a good shot here.  Granny, do you get high?  Yes, I do. 
[01:02:00]  Try some John Valby stuff.  Maybe those are a little bit better.  That was Weird Al?  Yeah, and he was like, he couldn't even keep up with the music.  Holy bad.  I lost on Jeopardy!  Did ya?  Did ya?  But it wasn't even like his soul.  They were betting their stash.  No Jamaican accent?  Why Jamaica? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  Because, you know.  Oh, pot.  The devil could have just went to Long Island for that song.  Well, we want to thank Weird Al for taking the energy right out of this.  Wow.  That's the best song, parody.  That was a wonderful song.  Laugh after laugh.  Thank you, Nude Beach George.  Who recommended that?  Nude Beach George.  Oh, your buddy from Long Island.  Yeah, thanks for helping out the program.  I was sitting home having some big laughs, hoping we don't interrupt the song.  Oh, my God.  Who's enjoying that?  I don't know. 
[01:03:00]  No one.  Hey, smoke the bag.  Give me a high five for you and your buddy.  Hey, you hear the song?  It's funny, man.  Yeah.  Fucking funny.  Here's the tease, because we have to take a break now.  Jack from Atlanta asking the question, did you see House last night?  Oh, we'll talk about House.  We'll talk about American Idol.  We'll talk about Lady Di and her homeless cribs.  Oh, my God.  Did you see it?  I'm depressed.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Why?  Well, we'll get into it next.  All right.  It is beyond sad, and it's just like, you know. 
[01:03:30]  I love the documentary style.  We'll get into it, definitely.  And Tom Cruise had a daughter.  No, he didn't.  And then we got to talk about the Roosevelt Island tram thing.  Or Retard Island, as they call it, as Ronnie calls it.  Ron and Fez.  Retard Island, Fez.  Yeah, you better listen to Ron and Fez today, because they talk about the Roosevelt Island tram all the time.  Yeah.  Anyway, we'll go to break.  This will make sense.  We got our old pal, Stephen Lynch, who's now the star of The Wedding Singer on Broadway. 
[01:04:00]  Is he coming in soon?  He's a Broadway star now.  He's a Broadway star now.  But anyway, here's one of the songs he did for us in studio once, and it'll tie something in that we were just talking about on the program.  Hopefully.  Well, hit it, and we'll see, I guess.  This is kind of the antidote to the Craig Christ song.  Oh.  It's because I figured since I did a Jesus song, a God-type song, I'd have to give the opposition equal time. 
[01:04:30]  So that's what this one's kind of about.  All right, here we go.  Ever since first man has walked this earth, I have been here, to whisper seeds of doubt and evil thoughts into his ear.  I am the beast, the outcast angel fallen from on high.  I go by many names, but there is one you can't deny.  My name is Satan. 
[01:05:00]  Hi, everybody.  Let me tell you a little bit about myself.  Okay, here we go.  My friends all call me Old Scratch, and I am a Capricorn.  My turn-ons are romantic walks and killing the unborn.  I got little devil horns and a little goatee.  Little devil eyes help a little devil see.  And little cloven hoots make it kind of hard to ski.  I'm Satan. 
[01:05:30]  Mephistopheles, another name I go by.  My real name is Beelzebub, but you can call me Beels.  I love to watch Fox News and then go club some baby seals.  Then I'll take a bubble bath and drink a Zinfandel.  Try to wash off that baby seal smell.  Then I'll make a toast to me.  Hey, here's to my health.  Oh, my name is Satan.  To carry on my evil ways, I went and had a son.  And now he makes his living as a singing comedian. 
[01:06:00]  I'm in every Zeppelin album.  I'm in all Rush Limbaugh's rants.  I'm the reason that the Boston Red Sox even had a chance.  And if I want to eat your soul, I'll just throw it on the griddle.  Don't need to make a deal.  I don't need to tell a riddle.  And fuck Charlie Daniels.  I don't care if you can fiddle.  I'm Satan.  The devil went down to Georgia.  He was looking for a soul to steal.  Which is fucking bullshit because I would not be caught dead in Georgia.  Okay?  It's like, oh, my God. 
[01:06:30]  Sick, sick, sick.  That's so much.  Prepare to be wowed.  What knockers.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Okay, okay, fine.  Wow.  Wow.  California, rest in peace.  Time will take me a release.  California, show your cheese. 
[01:07:00]  Choose from free to stop your face.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the latest from the red hot Chai Lai peppers.  I went local for Rochester.  And you guys didn't even know it.  No.  No.  There's a town up there that's spelled chili.  Yeah.  They call it Chai Lai.  Now, did Spud's Buckley ever visit Chai Lai?  I did Spud's Buckley when I was in Buffalo.  Oh, Buffalo.  I always get those mixed up, Opie.  I apologize. 
[01:07:30]  Speaking of Buffalo, it's Mike.  Mike, what's up?  Oh, I just met.  What's going on, boys?  Hey, Mike.  What do you say, Bill?  Well, I just want to tell you, I went to my local Best Buy yesterday, and I was rounding  the DVD.  And what do I see but your giant stand-ups over by the radio section?  Ooh.  There you go.  Marketing at work.  That's just like having a national commercial.  Our stand-ups.  It was kind of funny looking, because you guys got, you're standing there holding the  XM sign, and then you guys got these white frames around your faces, like Polaroids, 
[01:08:00]  and then littered all around both of your faces are wacky pictures of you guys making  funny faces.  Oh, is it that one?  The one that's right out here.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I want to ask why there's no ONA picture on the Javits Center.  It might be I didn't see it, but all I saw was Snoop, Ellen, and Baseball.  Why would they have our picture up there?  I want to know why.  I would like to know what's...  Why would they actually do that?  Can we ask Elo?  I forgot to ask him before.  Maybe he has an explanation.  You wouldn't want us up there.  Well, Elo, if you're still listening to the program, why don't you give us a call? 
[01:08:30]  If you could.  I want to say one thing I love...  I'll tell you why, because we're not as important as those shows in the company's mind,  and we all know that, but...  Baseball is baseball, but they'll deny that.  Ellen, Snoop, come on.  I want to say, I love Pal Talk.  It's a great online place.  It's like, you know, it's like a message board.  It's video conferencing is what it is.  You get on, and you have various people.  Everyone has a camera, and you log on.  You see each other now in full video, and you can then chat with a mic, or you can just 
[01:09:00]  type like anything else.  It's like people message board, a lot of them don't like it, but it's like a message board.  It really is.  It's like people just communicate.  This is just in real time, and you get to see tits.  And everybody, it's like a gossip thing.  Everybody does it.  It's part of, you know, look, I'm guilty of it.  We're all guilty of it.  But there are certain guys, the cock blocking that goes on, and I'm just telling you, some  of you guys that think all these things you tell people are being kept secret, the blabbing  you're doing, everybody knows you're doing it. 
[01:09:30]  It gets back to you.  It gets back to you, constantly.  And I'm going to start fucking calling out you cock blockers by name.  Wow.  Shut your fucking mouths.  Jimmy's trying to...  No, no, it's not even...  Dude, my fucking reputation on the show...  Jimmy's trying to get laid.  My reputation on the show fucking wrecks me in the palace.  You know what I mean?  It really does, because...  It does.  You know, chicks don't want to line up with you.  But that's not who Jimmy is. 
[01:10:00]  No, well, it kind of is.  And if Jimmy just wants to chat, make friends, and things like that...  I mean, please, we could goof about it.  We could goof about it, but who really wants AIDS?  Anyone?  That hurt.  No?  Don't car crash me.  I wasn't going to car crash you.  That's great.  You yelled at me just for taking this thing off.  You're going for the car crash.  No, I have a car crash on everyone.  I don't have to change the banks for a car crash.  Oh, uh-oh.  What are you giving me?  I wasn't.  I was going to do this. 
[01:10:30]  Nobody's got AIDS.  There you go.  Tony's saying...  Nobody's got AIDS.  He's a fag.  This is actually not about me getting laid.  My reputation does kind of hurt me.  This is about something that somebody told somebody else.  And it's like, to the guy that broke somebody else's trust and blabbing it, you dumb motherfucker.  People know you're blabbing.  Shut your face.  So this is very inside information.  Not really.  It's just about...  I just want to say that.  So pretty much you're...  The whole country will have to listen to that.  Yes, they will. 
[01:11:00]  Pretty much you're using our national talk show to bitch slap one guy out there.  I wouldn't say quick slap.  Because I have no idea what you're talking about.  It's like any other community.  It's like there's all these trust issues and things like that.  And it's like...  Right.  Everybody is just...  And it's not even said I really care about people.  No, I really don't.  It's just...  You know, people are just such fucking...  The point is this.  Guys that cock block are like those little cretching hen houses.  I expect that shit from women because that's what they do. 
[01:11:30]  Who is it?  Women are...  Now, I won't say until...  Maybe it will stop.  I won't bless them.  But the bottom line is women do that shit.  But when guys do it, it should be fucking punishable by death.  Just say it.  Doug out, Doug.  No, Doug cock blocks just because he doesn't mean to.  But his voice is such a mood killer.  Hey, gentlemen.  How are you, gentlemen?  He just yaps in the room.  You can't get a rap going.  Because every time you want to, that stupid Doug thing just jumps over you.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  So he cock blocks accidentally.  And you actually have another problem, too. 
[01:12:00]  The get smart thing.  Holy shit.  Look, here's what happened.  I'm so glad you finally bring this up on the air because I'm sick of it, too.  When we go on break, all right, the thing we got to do is we run out.  We usually go to the bathroom.  Master Paul gets up.  And he opens the door for us, which is nice.  It's a nice luxury.  Yeah.  But I hate it.  There's two doors to get through security-wise.  Two doors.  He opens both of them.  An airlock.  And then he takes the key and opens the men's room door in a very ceremonial fashion.  You know, the door is like a macho opening. 
[01:12:30]  And we walk through.  And we walk through.  That's what's going through all the doors just to get to the bedroom.  And then a vault door opens.  And that's being held by an intern.  Way to play the music before the line comes out.  Yeah.  But coming back in, can you turn that down a little bit?  For the love of God, we got it.  Get smart.  Why don't we just not do the show and play the fucking entire episode?  And then just...  Kiss in a phone booth.  Let me just play TV Themes Volume 1. 
[01:13:00]  So, yeah, I hate walking through.  Bum, bum, bum!  All right, we know.  We get it.  It's a get smart.  Doors, they open automatically.  And I just hate.  Bum, bum, bum, bum!  So, I hate when I'm going...  The part I hate is when I'm coming back.  How, like...  Because Paul has a little thingy, like a garage door opener, and I push.  And it kind of unlocks the door.  But the fact that when you're walking back in, you can't see who's on the other side of the door.  The door just opens for you.  Right.  And it's an intern who opens the door on cue.  And that shit has to stop.  It fucking bugs me. 
[01:13:30]  I'm not that spoiled that I need to...  It's a little thing.  It's a courtesy.  I don't need it.  Where's the...  Where's that fucking...  The awful, unshaven intern who was in here before?  You have no idea.  That fish mouth.  Where is it?  If they don't do it right, they get yelled at.  I know that there has to be a way that this is done like they...  If the timing's off...  Well, Paul makes it look like he's pushing a button and that's making the door open by  itself.  But he's using an intern.  The intern has to take that cue and open the door for Jimmy.  It's like some grip that used to slide the Star Trek doors open and close. 
[01:14:00]  Now, what is your name?  I'm Sean.  Is this your first day?  Welcome, Sean.  Thanks.  I've been here for months.  How about up on the mic?  There you go.  All right.  Yeah.  Now, you know, we'll walk and come back in.  I'm only asking Sean today because I see he was the guy I saw.  They ask Sean, they'll ask the little armed fella, they'll ask a bunch of people.  And if Paul, when he pushes that button, it does unlock the door for you so you can  just push through because the door has to be unlocked. 
[01:14:30]  So that's necessary.  Yeah.  But what happens with...  How does this whole thing come about?  Since my first day here, that's how it's been done.  I don't know why Paul needs this thing.  Now, are you instructed to stand there, look at the video monitor?  Okay, because we got cameras outside the door.  So you can see us coming out of the bathroom, down the hallway, through the video monitor.  And then right when we reach a certain point, you're supposed to open the door? 
[01:15:00]  I can see it surprises you guys sometimes.  You don't expect it to open.  No, I think I'm just going to walk headlong into it like an idiot.  It's not surprises in my mind.  I'm thinking to myself every single time, this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen in my life.  Again, because all you've got to do, once Paul hits the button, and it electronically unlocks the door...  As long as the door's unlocked...  Which it has to be.  ...then we can open it.  And that's fine.  We have to pull our IDs out and beep in every time would be a little bit of a bitch because we've got a limited time. 
[01:15:30]  And you may not have your card with you.  Sometimes you leave it in your jacket, whatever.  The bathroom key.  Yeah, it's just a big thing.  Things like that.  It has to be open.  But the door...  The door opened.  The double doors opened.  There's double doors that open up when we walk through after we've taken a leak.  Yeah, well, let me do the bit again.  We've got to play the music again.  All right.  Whoever played it.  So I hate going to the...  All right.  Okay.  No.  Loud. 
[01:16:00]  Jimmy gave the signal to make it louder.  And they made it softer.  Now I know what to do.  Okay.  Turn it off.  Oh, Iraq.  Oh, Iraq.  When we wanted it done one way, it went the other way.  Then we wanted to goof on how it was done in the first place.  You did it correctly.  And I made the little signal.  Like, you know how you take your pointer finger and thumb, and you put them like a quarter 
[01:16:30]  inch apart, and you go, scooch, scooch, scooch, scooch, scooch, scooch.  And he scooched it down.  To turn it up and turn it down.  He scooched, he scooched down.  I bring nothing to the table.  Oh.  I bring nothing to the table.  That's not true.  Is this on?  Is this on?  Is this on?  All right, listen.  Come on.  Let's get through this, because we've got so much other shit to do.  So, we...  I just want to know what your instructions were.  Yeah.  You got to stand by the door.  When you go into the bathroom, it'll open it for you.  And then, when I see you in the monitor coming, I got to open it again. 
[01:17:00]  You have to look at a monitor for us?  Yes, I do.  It's kind of a waste of manpower, pal.  Yeah.  We could actually, as long as the door's unlocked, we have no problem opening it.  We could kind of go through the doors ourselves.  That's right.  Yeah.  No, I understand, guys.  It's just that, you know, I want to make sure that you guys get in and out as quickly  as you can.  So, you go to the bathroom, you finish with the bathroom, you come back, and you're inside  the door.  Good intentions.  All right.  So, there's no delay.  A couple of times, there were some delays, and, you know, I want to make sure that you... 
[01:17:30]  He's been working on this system for months, by the way.  Because he browbeats these kids when they don't do it right.  Tell me now, let's have an instance of when you didn't do it right.  And why you fucked that up, you should be thrown out.  I remember standing there waiting for the door to open, and I didn't know what to do.  I stood there going, I...  What is told to you when it's not done correctly?  Gentlemen, you got to stand by the door, and...  Are you doing a master poem?  Is that a poem right here?  That's not...  The poem's not really stupid.  That's ballsy. 
[01:18:00]  That's about it, and...  What did he say, gentlemen?  You got to stand by the door?  Yeah, you got to stand by the door and make sure you're there.  That's all for the guys, because they're big stars, and they need to get through.  That's all.  Oh, okay.  Actually, I stand corrected.  Good job.  Good job.  Good job.  All right.  Job well done.  Thank you.  I prefer to keep up that way.  A little faster.  Now, what if one of us enjoys the door being held open, but the other ones don't?  Then they should learn that system, and see on the monitor who's coming, and get out  of my way.  Just give me a key.  That's all I need.  So, Jimmy...  All I need.  Jimmy doesn't want the door open for him.  Right.  Opie... 
[01:18:30]  No.  ...doesn't want the door open.  Me, I want that door open.  I like the system the way it is.  But you never leak.  I leak occasionally, but you know something?  Listen, I wash my fucking hands in the bathroom, and I don't want to touch pissy doorknobs.  Thank you.  Open it.  And as a matter of fact, Poe, if I may, could you add somebody to open the studio door  for me?  Not a problem.  Because I don't even want to touch that now.  We can't allow this to happen.  It shall be done.  Maybe Master Poe could carry you to the bathroom so your feet don't get dirty. 
[01:19:00]  I could walk, although that bathroom floor is a little dirty.  But...  I want to get that short-armed fella in there to do the tap.  You want like a washroom attendant where he turns it on, pumps some soap into your hand?  No, no.  Not that tap.  Oh, the tap on your penis to get the little last drips off.  The way I tap is I pull my hog farther, I squeeze it, it's really a violent act, and  I actually push under my ball vein to any little drops. 
[01:19:30]  Jesus Christ.  And I fucking shake.  And I still leak a quarter gallon into my pants.  All right, guys, that's all I wanted to know.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  This is terrific radio, but we really do have to move on.  Very good.  We had to do it.  This is just amazing.  I liked it.  It's good.  We're going to get an award any day now for our broadcast skills.  People love hearing the behind-the-scenes stuff.  That's right.  And if they don't, they can...  Now, forgive my language.  They can jump in a lake.  All right.  Here we go.  That's right.  We got Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes having a baby. 
[01:20:00]  Is this audio even worth playing?  All right.  There's the award winner then.  There you go.  That's the good radio.  Talk about something that everyone else is talking about.  Something that's on the news 20 fucking times today.  Guess who had a baby?  Oh!  Tom Cat!  Yes.  There's a Tom Kitten to talk about.  Tom Kitten is...  Did they just call it a Tom Cat?  Because it's Tom and...  Katie.  Katie.  So the relationship, because you have to have a name now for the relationship, no matter  who's together, is Tom Cat.  And now they're talking about their little kitten that they've had. 
[01:20:30]  What do they call him?  Tom Holmes.  Tommy the Wad Holmes?  Yeah.  Tom Cat.  You're doing the same thing I just did.  You're looking for name things.  Tom Holmes don't like to come up with.  I know.  Katie Cruz.  I got the homo part.  I'm just trying to think about the Kate part.  Homo.  Kate.  Katie.  Katie.  Homo.  Katie.  Katie.  Homo.  Oh, Homo.  Homo, Kate.  Cruisin' for Homo.  Cru...  You need to put words in there that don't fit. 
[01:21:00]  Why not?  Tom Cat.  Guess who had a baby?  Oh, Tom Cat.  Yes, there's a Tom Kitten to talk about.  Tom Kitten has been born.  One of Hollywood's most talked about couples waking up to a new reality this morning.  Tom Cruise.  Katie Holmes' new parents.  Katie Holmes gave birth to a baby girl named Suri.  It means princess in Hebrew.  Tom Cat's little bundle of joy weighing in at seven pounds, seven ounces.  That's a big baby.  Details surrounding the birth not disclosed.  Don't know about whether that whole silent birth thing worked out or not. 
[01:21:30]  But Star Magazine's Deputy Bureau Chief David Kaplan stopped by to share a juicy exclusive  scoop which hits newsstands today.  I'm afraid of it two weeks.  Tom Cruise has actually asked Katie to sign an agreement which states that he would get  full custody of their daughter if the two of them ever split.  And Katie and her family are not happy with this.  In fact, she was brought to tears when Tom suggested this.  He's great!  Understandably so.  By the way, mom and baby both reported doing just fine. 
[01:22:00]  Oh my God.  Well, that seems to me like he wanted a kid but he doesn't want a wife.  And looking to get her to sign over the goods.  And then after a little while, bye-bye.  And he's got a kid.  Kid that's his.  Not an adopted like the trend.  Go over to Africa for some reason.  I don't know, celebrities' planes can't land anywhere else but Africa when they've got  to get little kids.  And now he's got a kid of his own and he can get rid of her. 
[01:22:30]  Why shouldn't she get partial custody?  She makes enough cash to support it.  Do you think we'll ever get the full Tom Cruise story?  Eventually, yes.  Eventually when his movie career dies down?  Guaranteed.  Because that is just a weird, weird, weird, weird situation.  So we get the Rock Hudson version.  I need a good song.  That story wasn't coming out until he turned up.  Information wasn't passed as easily back then either, like the video and all that stuff  in the early 80s.  Brian in Rhode Island.  Hey, guys.  This is just hearsay.  I heard this from one of the guys at work. 
[01:23:00]  But he's telling me that he saw on TV last night that Tom Cruise wants to actually eat  the placenta of his kids.  I heard that too.  Yeah, but then I heard it was a rumor.  Some people eat the placenta.  Why?  No, they don't.  Some people eat the placenta.  Why?  Sometimes they fry it up in a pan.  No, they don't.  I swear to God.  Sometimes they eat the placenta.  How would you eat it?  That's pretty disgusting.  They put it in the freezer for a while and then they figure out what to do with it.  Someone call up.  Help me out here.  No.  No one help them out.  Someone help me out with the placenta thing. 
[01:23:30]  Some people eat it.  It's like good luck or something.  Ew.  Hey, the post, because they're just comedians.  They're terrific.  TomCat's new kitten, a girl.  Six things.  What is it?  Suri?  Oh, I didn't even notice.  Suri Holmes Cruise has to look forward to in life.  Are you guys ready for the funny?  Courtesy of the New York Post.  Oh, well, if it's the post, it's got to be funny.  Not only do they give you the news, they also bring on the funny.  The top six things right there shows they're not funny because they can't come up with ten. 
[01:24:00]  Not a big number.  The bit is ten.  So what?  They were sitting around in the newsroom and go, oh, shit, we only got six.  Do we run with it?  Do we go with the six?  Go with six.  Why not cut it down to five at that point?  You know.  Six.  Six.  Just shows that you don't know how to write comedy.  Six things Suri Holmes Cruise has to look forward to in life.  Number six.  The glorious day our alien leaders come back to Earth and liberate us from these human shells.  Oh, it's a religious joke. 
[01:24:30]  Number five.  Being hungrily eyed by Kirstie Alley at Scientology meetings.  Oh, she's going to eat the baby?  Yeah, because she's always hungry.  Yeah, that joke would have been, no, it wouldn't have been funny even a year ago.  Top six things Suri Holmes Cruise has to look forward to in life.  Number four.  Not being allowed to watch South Park ever.  All right.  Okay.  Okay. 
[01:25:00]  Phew.  Number three.  I thought you were up to six.  What happened?  Number three.  Mission Impossible 16.  Number two.  Jumping up and down on Auntie Oprah's couch during playdates.  This is awful.  This makes Cindy Adams look like Woody Allen's writings. 
[01:25:30]  Number one thing Suri Holmes Cruise has to look forward to in life.  Hey, where's my drum thing?  Get the drum roll.  Where's the drum?  And you got the drum thing.  No.  There you go.  Uh, fan.  Fan, help me, fan.  Fan.  Find it for him.  Got Santa Marenga.  You can't do a top six list without the drum thing as the number one thing.  With the drum thing.  You know what I barely use the drum thing.  No one does.  You know, I have over 10,000 sounds on this that I have to keep track of. 
[01:26:00]  Let's go to Peter in Massachusetts.  Peter.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey, Peter.  Where am I dumb?  Uh, I was reading about this, uh, British talk TV, uh, reality show where they, it was a cooking show.  Yeah.  And they had one of the contestants.  No?  What?  Wait, not yet, not yet.  No.  Sorry.  Dave, what on this reality show?  What's that?  What did they do on the reality show?  They took the placenta. 
[01:26:30]  They what?  With the placenta.  What?  Go fuck yourselves, you assholes.  All right.  Can you hit that thing?  Number one.  The number one thing Suri Holmes Crews has to look forward to in life, according to the New York Post, is... 
[01:27:00]  Being taller than her father by the time she's seven years old.  That's wonderful.  The freaking New York Post.  Any attempt at comedy by the New York Post just ends in tragedy.  Well, I will say there's one thing I actually realized.  I think it's Andrea Pizer's...  Hold on one second.  I want to grade the New York Post on that last bit. 
[01:27:30]  You folks fell on your face.  You get an F-minus in my book.  F-minus for the Post today.  That's a shame.  On the guy, the restaurant guy who had the photos taken of him whacking his bag.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He, uh...  Was that in the post, too?  Yeah.  Because they get an A-plus for that headline.  They certainly do.  It says...  The headline is, Subway Jerk Off the Hook.  It says, the way it is, is Subway is one line. 
[01:28:00]  Jerk off is the next line, and the hook is the third line.  Subway Jerk Off the Hook.  Yeah, they got Jerk Off right by itself in one line.  It's supposed to be Subway Jerk.  Yeah, they could have put Subway Jerk on one line, and then the other line, Off the Hook.  God, that is damn funny.  Well, they put Subway Jerk Off the Hook.  And, uh, yeah, he got probation.  That guy, uh...  A few months back, you might remember, he was on the Subway, a woman walked in the car, he's jacking off, and she snapped a picture of him. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  This scumbag guy, this guy, uh, Daniel, Dan Hoyt, actually said he's looking at himself like he's a victim of vigilante justice.  It's actually illegal to take pictures in the Subway, he said, of the victim's actions.  Yeah.  You motherfucker, you jerk off in front of some young shit, what is she, 18, 20?  You yank your stupid dick out and make this girl watch you, and you're trying to make yourself look like a victim?  Yeah.  She should have come over and fucking bitten it off and spit it in your face. 
[01:29:00]  Hey, um, we gotta go to Alabama, unfortunately.  Fred, what's up?  Hey, how's it going this morning?  Hey, Fred.  Hey, Opie, you got out of your role in the show.  You know, your role's the bad guy, but, you know, all those were funny, it was just a delivery.  Holy shit, look.  Hold on!  Hold on, listen, people have problems with me on this show, I get it.  But to actually say that those jokes are funny, that's not being honest. 
[01:29:30]  You don't mean that, sir.  Do you really?  Yeah, yeah.  You thought that top six list was funny and the problem was my delivery on it?  Because it's Opie's delivery.  I was purposely fucking up the delivery because the jokes stink.  You know, let Anthony try.  Let Patrice try.  Fred.  Right.  That'll do it.  You might want to start listening to your local morning zoo.  That's right, Fred, if you think that was funny.  It's funny.  Wait, wait.  It's funny that the number one thing she got to look forward to is that she's going to be taller than Tom Cruise by the time she's seven? 
[01:30:00]  Oh, I missed that one because I was on hold.  I turned the radio down.  Which one did you think was particularly funny?  Yeah, which one did you thought was funny?  All the other five were great.  Which one?  Name one.  It's just a delivery.  Name one.  Name one, Fred.  Oh, you guys are going to get me a ticket here.  Name one, Fred.  Name one.  Stop trying to laugh uncomfortably.  Come on, Fred.  Name one.  Come on, seriously.  Let Patrice talk.  Recite one of the jokes that were so funny but the delivery is bad. 
[01:30:30]  Recite one of them.  I'm asking for one out of the six.  I am really mad.  Katie Alley would eat her at the meeting.  What?  Yeah.  Katie Alley?  What is it?  Katie Alley.  Katie Alley would eat her at a meeting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, I'm the same way as Opie.  Katie Alley?  Katie Alley.  Dude, I don't have a car crash bad enough for you. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, you do that stupid uncomfortable laugh.  I hate the listeners that don't get what we do sometimes.  Go on.  Just let me know.  You guys.  The jokes were so bad, I purposely had no delivery whatsoever.  Blaine that, everyone knows it, but him and this one other guy, Katie Alley.  Katie Alley.  We're at a meeting.  Katie Alley.  I'll take you to the meeting.  Mora from Pennsylvania.  Hey, guys.  You know, Katie Alley, we're at a meeting. 
[01:31:30]  It's wonderful.  You guys read about this at all?  Kirstie Alley?  Katie Alley.  Impressions.  Katie.  Katie Alley.  Katie Alley.  Meetings.  Mora?  Interest.  Yeah.  Go.  Oh, great one.  A lot of people do that.  It's supposed to be a religious thing.  It's supposed to be good for you.  Thank you.  Opie's right.  People do eat the placenta.  It's good for you.  No, it's not good for you, and it's stupid.  It's part of a healthy diet.  I don't think it's good for you, but it's supposed to be very nutritious. 
[01:32:00]  Part of this delicious breakfast.  Exactly.  You want to make out with a guy after you say your baby's placenta?  Do you put a bid on?  No, that's disgusting.  All right.  Let's bring in some placenta.  Bill, we'll eat it.  Yes, Tom Cruise's.  Jesus.  Let's say hi to Theo in Virginia.  Theo.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I got a little placenta story for you.  Yeah.  With two of my kids, we did the placenta tree, where you bring the placenta home, you bury  it with the root ball of a tree.  Why?  So, I don't know.  Sometimes my wife came up with, I just went with it.  But I come home at like 7 o'clock in the morning after being in a hospital all night. 
[01:32:30]  I've been scrubbed on the front of my yard at like 7 o'clock in the morning with this  pan with a big placenta in it.  And I'm digging up this hole.  All of a sudden, the neighborhood kids start walking to the bus stop.  And they all stop.  And this one kid's like, hey, his wife was pregnant.  They're like, what are you burying?  And they come over and they're all checking it out and freaking out over the whole thing.  And I don't know.  Wait, you had to bury the placenta under a tree?  Right.  Well, before you plant the tree, you dig a hole and like drop it in there and then put  a tree over it.  Oh, so then as the tree grows. 
[01:33:00]  It's their tree or something, right?  It's the child's tree.  Oh, that's true.  And you can tell them when they're older.  Do you know your placenta was under the roots of this tree?  Right.  And then he...  Is that why the tree always throws up?  That's doing drugs.  Yeah.  Why don't you just tell your wife no?  I win with it.  What am I going to do?  She's like, you know...  Sir, why don't you say this?  She comes up with this thing.  She finds it in a magazine.  And I'm like, we can do that.  I didn't know if she was going to stick me to it.  I didn't even think they'd let us take it out of the hospital.  Why don't you just fucking throw it out and tell her, yeah, I planted this. 
[01:33:30]  You know, you can say no to your spouse.  Yes.  Yeah.  Sometimes you could just say no.  Back in the old days, the guy just paced around smoking in the waiting room and then  handed out cigars when he heard the news.  Now they got to be in there.  They got to cut the cord.  They got to fucking, a push baby.  Oh, it was a wonderful moment.  I am pushing you, motherfucker.  Yeah.  And then placenta.  They got to bury it under a tree.  Just have the kid.  Hand out a cigar.  Hey, it's a boy.  Congratulations. 
[01:34:00]  Tip your fedora to the doctor.  Push, push.  Oh, no.  Oh, the head's a little bigger than I'd hope.  Blah.  Blah.  All right.  I'm going to plant the placenta and let's see if we can make an old switcheroo in the  delivery room.  Yeah.  Let's go take what's in that basset at home.  How about we put the placenta in the crib and plant the kid under the tree?  Great.  The placenta's going to fertilize a hedge.  You know that you put the placenta in, you have a dopey willow? 
[01:34:30]  Well, hey, we got number three on the waves.  If you want, I'll send the placenta up, airmail, and you can have a contest with it.  Yeah, we'll smear it all over our faces and start laughing.  We can put it in Twitchell's hand.  There you go.  All right.  Thanks, sir.  Let's go to Tim.  He wants to defend Alabama.  Tim?  Yeah.  When you're driving through Alabama, don't call in and claim you're from Alabama when  you're actually from somewhere else.  Yeah.  Is that what truckers do?  He was trucking.  He ain't from no damn Alabama.  I mean, we ain't that goddamn stupid. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, because to begin with, Alabama gets a bad name on this program.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Yeah.  And that guy didn't help your call.  Or Bama.  No, he did.  Those jokes were horrific.  Punching out.  Thank you, Tim.  A lot of people call on saying that Cruz joked about eating the placenta.  Yes, it was a joke.  On his primetime live interview.  And guess what?  Through the magic of radio, we got the audio.  In a recent magazine article, Cruz even made fun of what people think Scientologists do.  Suggesting that he'd eat the placenta. 
[01:35:30]  Tell me you're joking.  Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  No, no.  That's, that's, we're going to do that whole family thing is we're going to eat the placenta.  Don't, don't you have friends that isn't that just normal and natural?  See, they're going to really, they're going to take this and go think he really ate the placenta.  No, we're not eating.  No.  All right.  No.  No, no.  And by no, I mean, yes.  Whatever L. Ron Hubbard wrote, that's what we have to do.  Quiet, silent birth.  Actually, no birth.  Fake thing underneath the dress. 
[01:36:00]  Why would you want a silent birth?  It's like, let her make all the noise she wants and then be silent the rest of the time you're home.  Like, what you do is this.  Here's how your marriage should be if you're a rich Scientologist.  As you point at your cock, she sucks.  You point at your stomach, she brings in chips.  I like it.  That's what a silent marriage should be.  Let's go to Bill in South Carolina.  Bill.  I think it works that way.  Yeah, you take that placenta and you batter it.  Then you deep fry it and it tastes like calamari. 
[01:36:30]  You've had this?  Yeah, I'm serious.  No.  No.  Yes, yes.  No.  It's kind of bland.  It's kind of chewy.  It's good.  It's fucking cannibalism.  It's cannibalism.  But you're deep frying it, so you don't really taste it.  Oh, okay.  Oh, great.  So if the Donner party had a deep fryer, everything would be cool.  You mean they ate each other up?  They had a deep fryer on that plane in Peru. 
[01:37:00]  Soccer players would have been fine.  Hey, we deep fried it.  Oh.  Forget it then.  Feel no guilt.  The other huge story in New York, and I'm sure it's making its way around America today.  Ta-da.  The high-wire drama.  Horror above the river.  High anxiety, as Newsday puts it.  Yeah.  High-wire drama.  Dozens of tram riders dangle over East River for, what, 11 hours?  11 hours.  Hours.  They were stuck on this stupid Roosevelt Island tramway. 
[01:37:30]  What was that Sylvester Stallone movie?  Nighthawk?  Nighthawk featured the Roosevelt Island tramway, so it's the first Spider-Man.  Oh, that's right.  The first Spider-Man.  Okay.  There you go.  So for the rest of the country, that tram got stuck.  And if you've ever been on the King Kong ride, I believe, at Universal Studios years ago.  Confrontation.  Confrontation.  I have photos of myself after that.  Confrontation.  I thought that was that Vegas video clip we watched.  Oh, you won't see any ethnicities mentioned in that story. 
[01:38:00]  Of course not.  Yeah, Confrontation.  If you've been on that, you get on the tramway.  And then in the middle of it, a big fake robotic gorilla comes up and breathes on you.  Right.  That's pretty pretty good.  Well, why did it take 11 hours to get these people down?  Because their contingency plan takes a long time, apparently.  This thing's been running for 30 years, I guess.  Had its problems.  Carries people over to a little-known shithole called Roosevelt Island. 
[01:38:30]  And it's people that kind of want to live in the city but can't really afford it.  It's also known as Retard Island on the Ron and Fez show.  Retard Island on the Ron and Fez show because there are many retards that live there.  And no matter how sunny and nice it is in New York, there's always a dark cloud and it's pouring rain over Retard Island.  And in order to get there, you've got to take a subway or a bus or this tramway.  And a lot of people take the tram.  And last night or during rush hour, a little before rush hour, it just stopped dead right in the middle. 
[01:39:00]  So now you've got people coming and going each way.  And it stopped over the East River.  And they were trapped in there.  And with no power, there's really no way to get to them.  They were able to get to one of the cars with a crane.  But the other car was stuck so far in the middle that they had to send this auxiliary car that they hook onto the cable.  And I guess it's self-powered. 
[01:39:30]  So you go up there.  Like a little squeaky wheel.  Yeah, at a snail's pace.  Right.  And offload a few people at a time.  And then go back down.  Go back up.  So I guess they were getting the kids first.  And maybe sickly.  Did they offload you at that height?  No, they would take the little cable car that they attach onto the cable.  This little box.  And then ride that thing up the cable.  It's self-powered.  Right.  And ride it up.  Offload them from the tram onto this other little thing. 
[01:40:00]  In the middle of that high up.  Oh, at that high up.  Yeah, yeah.  You know how horrified I would have been?  Oh, terrifying.  Yeah.  And then they take you down at a slow pace.  Drop you off and go back.  And it took 11 hours to get people off.  Well, we got some audio.  Because I know what you're going to get into.  Oh, yeah.  Listen to this audio.  This has to be a nightmare.  The rescue attempt is over.  And everybody that was on both tram cars is off.  And they're safe and sound.  Now, this was a very unusual rescue.  Because it involved the police officers from the NYPD's emergency service unit. 
[01:40:30]  Using a basket on the cable.  Going over to the tram that was headed towards Roosevelt Island.  And then on the tram car that you're seeing right now from this live picture.  What they did is they used construction cranes to try and get the passengers off.  Now, in the Roosevelt Island tram car.  The people were on that one for over five hours.  There's the one here on the Manhattan side.  They were in that for almost 11 hours before they got off.  It just seems this day and age you shouldn't be stuck for that long. 
[01:41:00]  It's not even the right height to get you off.  Do you have to, like, jump up into it?  Yeah, you have to kind of climb up into it.  Into the thing.  I'm sure they gave you some safety ropes and stuff.  Oh, I'm sure the safety was...  They gave you a little harness or something.  But, well, here you go.  Listen to this clip.  Now, the cops took a little bit of a different twist with this.  Not only were they concerned with actually physically getting the people off the cars.  But what they were also worried about was the people, some of the complaints that they were getting from people inside those tram cars. 
[01:41:30]  They've been in there for hours without food and water.  There were a lot of children there.  And what they were asking for was food, water, and diapers.  So early on into this rescue, just as the cops and the firefighters and the Office of Emergency Management were strategizing about what they were going to do,  they got food in duffel bags into the people as well as baby formula and diapers so that they could rest,  so they could be a little bit more comfortable as they waited for the rescuers to get to them.  Yeah, there were kids on the tram.  I swear to you. 
[01:42:00]  Now, you know if they're asking for diapers, it's because these little things shit themselves.  So now you're stuck in this tram smelling like baby shit with crying babies that are hungry.  And the thing is no bigger than this room.  Dude, so it's a lot smaller than the room.  A lot smaller than what?  Like 10 feet by 6 feet across, 7 feet across maybe?  It's just not big enough.  And I swear, again, I must bring up the last episode of MASH. 
[01:42:30]  I would have to suffocate.  I would have to have the mother suffocate the baby because I could not be in that kind of closed quarters with a screaming child like that.  Any adults have to piss and shit in the corner?  Yeah, what do you do?  Do you just all agree?  Hold it for 11 hours or you piss out the side?  You piss out the window, maybe?  No, but I mean the shit.  You got to shit.  Did you take a dump out the side?  No.  You go, hold on to my arms.  I got to take a dump.  200 feet in the air?  These are the questions the reporter's got to ask.  How do you go to the bathroom? 
[01:43:00]  You know who takes the tram?  They probably just shit in their hand and fling it at the emergency service workers.  I can't be sure, but I've never taken the tram.  I'm assuming they designated a corner.  I don't know anyone that takes the tram.  I doubt there's a first class section in the tram.  They must have designated a corner for the shit.  Just a shit corner?  Yeah.  What a nightmare.  What we're looking at right now, the tram car has moved from the position that it was 
[01:43:30]  in a little bit earlier where it had been stuck all night long since about 5.15 yesterday  afternoon, and it is starting to make its descent now back into the docking station here on Manhattan's  east side right off of 2nd Avenue.  So it's coming in very, very slowly.  Obviously, they've gotten some kind of electricity or power situation going again.  That had been a very big problem.  It was a power outage that caused the tram to stop, come to a standstill yesterday in  the first place, and then their emergency backup generator also failed. 
[01:44:00]  So now what you're looking at is that tram car that had been stuck over Manhattan making  a slow descent back over here to this station.  What a nightmare.  How can you not get power to it?  I don't know.  They just completely blew out the power, and then their auxiliary generator went, and  they were done, I guess.  And then they decided that they need some kind of full investigation, so now it's just shut  down.  And by the way, this will never happen again.  Why?  Well, you've got to wait for a tragedy. 
[01:44:30]  This wasn't a tragedy.  No one died.  But you've got to wait for something like this to happen, and then they fix stuff.  I guarantee they knew there were problems.  There was problems, and this could be an issue someday, but they only upgrade and make things  better after a tragedy.  You ever notice that?  Yeah.  Just in general, it's like, oh, okay, now we've got to fix the tram.  Is this guy calling me out?  Pappy in Jersey?  What is that?  Hey, Pappy.  Oh, it's Papsky.  Hey, Pappy.  How's it going?  What's up, man?  I swear, when I hear that phone click and I'm on the air, I get a stomachache. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, it's a little nerve-wracking.  I'm wondering how you drive a bus to Roosevelt Island, Professor Anthony.  Isn't there a one bridge?  I used to drive the whole time.  There is a bridge, but you have to go to Long Island first.  Queens.  Really?  Queens, yeah.  You have to go over the...  The Queensborough Bridge.  The 59th Street Bridge.  No, no, no.  Yes, I used to do it.  59th Street Bridge.  Yes, it's Queensborough Bridge.  And you go over that, and there's like a lower and an upper.  There's two ways to get off the 59th Street Bridge. 
[01:45:30]  One of them takes you on to like 21st Street.  I forget the exact road, but you just...  It's through Queens.  Yeah, you got to go through...  You can't get from Manhattan over there.  It's the Verrazano.  Yes, you can.  The Verrazano...  I'm not the Verrazano.  It's the Verrazano Island.  No, the Triborough.  The Triborough?  Yeah, Triborough has an exit for Roosevelt Island.  Positive.  I bet you that dumps you in Queens, though.  Yeah, yeah, it does.  It probably goes to Roosevelt Island and it probably dumps you in Queens.  And then there's a little bridge that goes over to Roosevelt Island from Queens.  A little thing?  Yeah, so you can either take the Queensborough or the Triborough if you're driving there right now. 
[01:46:00]  I would have shit my pants to have to climb up that high.  I would have died doing that.  I'd have lost it just being in there that long with that many children.  Little screaming babies.  You know what that does on a plane?  And they talk about like...  They try to make it more dangerous and harrowing than it really is.  It's a tram.  It loses power.  It's not like an airplane where it's going to drop out of the sky.  It's hanging from a cable.  It's inconvenient.  It stinks.  I sure wouldn't want to be in there. 
[01:46:30]  But it's not like, you know, the cable's going to snap.  You need Spidey.  It's just a pain in the ass, though, to be waiting that long.  We got some kids talking about one kid's testimony.  A lot of people cheered us up when we were up there.  They were making us laugh.  They were dancing a little bit.  And they were nice people.  And sometimes you can find great people in New York.  Sometimes you can.  Yes, you can.  All right.  You got stuck on the tram. 
[01:47:00]  All right.  It's not exactly like fucking being in the towering inferno.  Right.  Or, you know, come on.  It stinks, but shut your face.  It's happened before.  You know.  It's happened.  Someone's saying I'm wrong about the Triborough.  Then I'm wrong.  I went there once, and I thought I went over the Triborough.  That's all I know.  Oh.  Very important.  OB is geographically challenged.  Geographically challenged.  Tony.  Hey, what's up, O?  I don't want to bust your shoes, but.  It's all right.  I have no problem with people.  When you come off the Triborough. 
[01:47:30]  Huh?  Wards Island.  Wards Island?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's where.  Yeah.  Oh, is that where the, like, the fire department does their training?  Exactly.  All right.  Okay, then.  I saw them there, and you got the park there that they do all of the Cirque du Soleil and  all that crap.  I thought it was the same piece of land.  What an idiot I am.  No, Wards Island's between Queens and Manhattan, and they got Goldwater Hospital, which is for  all the old people there.  Yeah, watch that movie.  Goddamn, what the hell was the name of it? 
[01:48:00]  With the girl in the water tank.  What?  Yeah, Dark Waters.  Dark Waters, I think it's called.  Yeah, and it's on location, the whole thing, on Roosevelt Island.  It is one of the most depressing, ugh, atmosphere movies.  Remember Seven, how it was raining all the time, and it's dark and dingy?  Until the end.  That's exactly what this movie is.  It's just depressing.  They show, and it's real apartment buildings there that were built like they were supposed 
[01:48:30]  to look modern when they were built in the 50s, I guess, and it's just an awful place.  I don't understand who lives there or why Fez lives there.  Look, that's how they did it, Jimmy.  Oh, I'm sorry.  The other thing is to get to Roosevelt Island, you go in Astoria off of 36th Street, and then  there's a bridge that takes you.  Oh, I apologize.  Ward Island, yeah.  Brother Weez came down to broadcast live after 9-11, and there was a big presentation for  the fire department, and I went there to check it out, and it's an amazing place, Ward Island. 
[01:49:00]  Ward Island?  Well, that's where they train the fire department.  Right.  That's a huge facility there, and stupid me, I thought it was part of Roosevelt Island.  I had no idea until right now.  They have such a great history of these islands.  Like, they try to make something of them now, but years ago, any of these little islands off  of Manhattan Island were just for wayward, diseased people.  Like, they would just ship them off to these islands to rot away, like Leperville. 
[01:49:30]  They would just send sickly people there.  They would just have a criminally insane, whatchamacallit, like a Pilgrim State over  there.  Oh, really?  Yeah, in that place.  When you're coming over to Tribor, let's say you're going into Manhattan, and you make  the turn going in towards the toll booth.  On your left-hand side, you see that big building?  It's brown.  That's for criminally nutty people, you know?  And then what is that?  Like, cut-your-head-off kind of people.  What is that big refinery-looking thing with smokestacks, and there's something there that 
[01:50:00]  you shouldn't live within, like, 20 miles of, it looks like, but it's right smack in  the middle of Roosevelt Island.  Well, Ant, that's like us out on the island with Plum Island and Brookhaven National Laboratories.  Yeah, Plum Island's a great place.  The Brookhaven National Laboratories have high rates of tritium and stuff.  We're all going to die of cancer.  I know it.  Long Island.  Yeah, every once in a while, you get a glimpse of Plum Island, and it's just creepy.  There's nothing really on it.  Oh, God, they got, like, three-eyed people walking around this. 
[01:50:30]  Plum Island is the island that they have for diseased animals, or something like that.  They're doing all sorts of testing out there.  Yeah, research.  Yeah, diseased animals.  Anthrax and all kinds of stuff.  That we can drop on people and kill them.  And they got high security.  Like, you can't even get close to that island on your boat.  Exactly.  And then they got the Brookhaven Labs out east.  That whole forks on Long Island are just glowing.  They glow in the dark.  All right, hold on.  I got to go move on, because Jim is now saying I'm wrong again. 
[01:51:00]  All right.  I'm having a rough morning, I guess.  Jim.  No, you're not, Opie.  It's not your fault, bro.  That always gets screwed up.  It's Randall's Island is where the fire department is.  Randall's Island.  Between all three of them, bro.  What?  That always gets screwed up between Roosevelt, Ward, and Randall's.  So now you're telling me that the fire facility, where they train the fire department, is on  Roosevelt Island?  No, it's on Randall's Island.  No, Opie. 
[01:51:30]  Gilligan's Island, which is just north.  I'm looking at the map right now.  And you can take a bus there.  All right.  There's Roosevelt Island, yes.  Randall's Island and Ward's Island, right?  Yeah.  Have a good day, guys.  But the other guy said it's on Ward's Island.  He was a lying sack of shit.  Forget it.  It's out there somewhere.  What?  You know, look at a map.  Look at a map.  Just look it up if you even give a shit.  I'm not your teacher.  The hell are we here?  Right.  What are we doing?  John.  Hey, what's up?  I want to go back to that news clip you guys were playing.  Yeah.  Did you ever notice lately on the news, it seems they're always interviewing the fucking kids. 
[01:52:00]  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute.  Uh-oh.  Opie is pissed.  Ward's Island and Randall's Island are two different islands, but they're the same island.  Right.  Someone explain that to me.  Well, they have, like, different names, but it's the same island.  It's like the Dominican Republic and Haiti.  So how am I wrong?  And by that, I mean exactly.  How the fuck am I wrong if I'm looking at a map, and it's one island, but part of it's  called Randall's Island, and the other part's called Ward's Island. 
[01:52:30]  You're right.  I'm looking at that right there.  And this island is very small.  It's not like a, no, an island should have one name.  Right.  Manhattan.  Yes.  So how am I wrong?  Long.  Why, now we have to find out why part of it's called Ward's Island, and why part is called  Randall's Island.  I actually do know the, uh, shut up, Jim.  I do know the answer to that, actually.  There was a man named Randall.  Teddy Randall and Frank Ward.  Frank Ward.  And they had an argument. 
[01:53:00]  They had an argument and settled it in sitcom style, where they just made a line down the  middle of the island.  That's right.  And one person was mad because the bathroom facility was on one side, but Ward could cook  on his side.  It was originally called Nesman Tarlik.  Oscar Felix was another one, and I believe the Brady Kid Island.  All right.  Oh, no, that would be, um, that would be Father Girls.  I protest my wrongness.  I, uh, got to agree with you there, uh, Opie. 
[01:53:30]  All right.  Randall's and Ward, same island.  Let's go to John.  John?  Yeah.  Hey there, John.  I was just going back, I was just going back to that news clip.  Did you ever notice when I was saying anything, anything goes down these days?  They're always interviewing the fucking kids.  Like, they have anything significant to fucking say they should be fucking seen and not heard.  Good point.  Oh, and hit every so often.  Here's how every interview should go.  How about this?  Um, you be the, uh, let's see, who should you, you be the reporter.  All right.  And this is what it should sound like.  And you see the kid and you go, what happened? 
[01:54:00]  Hey, Sonny, what happened?  Well, I...  Looking back to you in the studio.  Look at me reading instant feedback.  John writes, new Tyra Banks episode, fear of being stuck in a tram with dolphins.  Oh, wow.  It could happen.  It could happen.  Jim in New York, what's up, Jim?  Hey, guys, it's definitely Randall's Island. 
[01:54:30]  I'm a farmer.  It's around Randall's Island.  Yeah, but isn't Randall's Island and Ward Island the same island?  Yeah, they're, uh, separated by, like, two feet of water.  No, I didn't see any water.  We don't see water in between the two.  I don't know.  Oh, there's a bunch of softball fields on Ward Island.  So on low tide, it's one island, high tide, two islands?  Maybe that's it.  Yeah, maybe.  Maybe that's it.  All right, thank you.  You got to fill in that obvious water park joke, too, on Randall's Island with the shwoogies.  All right, thanks. 
[01:55:00]  We'll let you do that.  Thank you.  Joe in New York.  Yeah, how you doing?  Hey.  He's going to explain the Randall's Ward's Island, thank you, finally.  Controversy, yes.  Yeah, it used to be two islands, but when they dredged the rivers, they took all the shit  they pulled out and made them one island.  Oh, so they had to dredge the river so the barges could get through.  They do that every so often.  And they took the excess dirt and piled it on top, and all of a sudden, hey, what the  fuck are we going to do?  We got one island now.  All right, now we got it.  With two names.  Now we got to figure out who wins. 
[01:55:30]  I like that one.  It's Randall's Island.  Everybody calls it Randall's Island.  That's what I thought.  No one calls it Ward's Island, right?  No.  Honestly, when I went there, they said Ward's Island a lot.  Eh, I work down there, so.  All right.  All right.  It doesn't look like there's anything on it.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Mike?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You know, the other thing about that clip, they were dancing up in that tram.  They said they were dancing?  Yeah, the kids.  It's called the pee-pee dance.  I did it when I was a kid, too.  You got to pee so bad, you just kind of dance. 
[01:56:00]  That's some poor kids, though.  First to it, like, see, this is the stuff I love.  So you're stuck in the tram, and you're the one that has to crap.  What do you do?  Do you just say, look, it's-  What you're talking about-  Like, someone has to bring it up and go, look, turn around.  I got to crap, and I'm sure a few of you, you're going to have to crap soon.  So what are we going to do here?  Find it.  What are we going to do?  You can't hold it for 11 hours?  What if you just had a coffee and a bagel?  You're on your way home.  Unless you're the guy, yeah, that got on that tram going, oh, my God, I got to get home  and take a dump.  The second he gets on, like, it's poking out, and he goes, it's a five-minute tram ride. 
[01:56:30]  I can make it.  And 11 hours, he's stuck with a dump in him.  Do you crap in your pants and hope no one notices?  No.  What do you do?  That you could do.  Maybe that's why they sent the diapers.  Maybe a kid didn't crap.  Some guy crapped his pants and goes, hey, lady, you're a kid.  I'm smelling shit.  You get that loose tingling feeling on the back of your thighs, it's so bad. 
[01:57:00]  And nothing's even poking out, because what you have is a fucking mochaccino ready to fly out.  There's no turtle poking its head out.  It can't be.  It would have to be a brown placenta.  Oh, God.  That awful.  That is horrid.  I think it's time for some Poopin' Green.  Oh, wow.  A classic.  I've been Poopin' Green.  And we have to, at one point, get to the Mets.  We're going to do that next.  Okay.  We're going to take a break with a little prank call from our old CD, Dementor World. 
[01:57:30]  What didn't we get to that we thought we were getting to after the last break?  We did pretty good.  Very important.  We got to Tom Cruise and we did the Roosevelt Darlan thing.  We're actually getting things done today.  We have the new house promo.  Ah, right.  We have American Idol.  With a great load joke from Kelly Pickler, by the way.  Did you pick up on that?  Yes, I did.  All right.  Also, no.  Also, the Metropolitans.  The Mets with their brand new theme song, yes?  Yes, the Metropolitans.  They're not the Met. 
[01:58:00]  They're the Metropolitans.  The Metropolitans.  Minnesota Man, Busted for Jackin' It.  Worst Stutterer Ever.  And Lady Di, Homeless Crobs.  Yes, that's what I wanted to get to.  But first, this.  Hello?  Hi, this is Harry.  I was in your restaurant the other day.  I got some takeout.  Yes.  And ever since, I've been pooping green.  What?  I've been pooping green.  You've been pooping green?  Green poopies?  Yes.  Lots and lots of green poopies.  And I went to a doctor and he told me to go back 48 hours to see what I ate. 
[01:58:30]  And the only thing I could think of is the takeout from your restaurant.  When is that?  I got takeout Sunday afternoon.  Sunday afternoon.  And ever since, I've been pooping green.  What did you order, sir?  Beef and broccoli.  Beef and broccoli.  And I've been pooping green ever since.  Have you ever dry heat from your butt before?  No.  Oh, my God.  After all the green poopy left, I was still getting the squirts, but nothing was coming out. 
[01:59:00]  I think after all these couple days, you are the only one complaining.  Let me know about this thing.  Well, the doctor suggests that I come down with some of the green poopy and maybe you  could identify it.  We could throw it in a strainer and maybe if you could identify the broccoli, things will  be okay.  It's okay.  You can come down with it.  Have you ever pooped green?  No.  It's not fun.  Let me tell you.  Yeah, I know something like that.  This would be pretty bad, too, you know? 
[01:59:30]  Well, I got green racing stripes in my underwear.  Jesus Christ.  It's not fun.  Are you laughing at me, sir?  No, I'm not.  I'm just, you know.  Oh, I'm turning it into a Play-Doh fun factory.  Jesus Christ.  Lots and lots of green poopies.  Jesus Christ.  What is your feet?  Wait a minute.  I'm going to be dry even for my butt again.  Listen to this.  Oh, see, nothing comes out. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, but why don't you go back to the doctor again?  See what the doctor can identify with, what is it?  Because we're not in the medical staff.  We cannot identify anything about those things.  You've never heard of green poopies before?  No, never.  This is the first case I can hear about it.  Yeah.  Would you like to hear another dry heat from the pot?  I think it should be good enough.  Well, let me do one more.  I'm in the bathroom with the cellulophone. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, did you hear that?  Yes, I hear you.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, God.  Well, this is exhilarating.  I was walking down the street, and some construction guy was shouting at me, 
[02:01:00]  Hey, show me your cans.  So I did.  And he plummeted 17 floors and was impaled on a forklift.  But my tits looked great.  Please, wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the Opie and Anthony show.  Every year, they got to do that.  Time, once again, to bring Fatty on TV and try to find a bathing suit for her. 
[02:01:30]  Look, look.  Who's she kidding?  You're still Fatty.  Oh, God.  But, you know, the cut of this suit really doesn't show the fat.  See, what we do with this is give you fake abs in front.  Yeah.  Looks like Betty Thomas.  Look at this.  Oh, look at this crap.  They do it every year.  The print suits.  And these are always issues for women.  40 plus.  Are worried about their figures.  Which suits wear that has prints?  You know, print suits are something that women avoid. 
[02:02:00]  But when you're trying to build curls or you want to be discreet about having them,  they're actually a very good choice.  You want to be discreet.  The neckline here is the issue.  You can choose a very high neckline or very low neckline and change your proportion.  Linda is wearing a suit by Spiegel that's $39.  It's an amazing suit.  Now, I see why they...  It has translucent Lycra spandex in it, a soft cup, shelf rod.  From the Spiegel catalog, yeah.  We don't want to leave it when recording anymore. 
[02:02:30]  We don't have a bravadoom.  Girlfriend, you look fantastic in that suit.  No, you don't.  All right, and Jill.  Jill's wearing the opposite.  She's wearing a plunge neckline on a Gore-Tex suit.  And you look at Jill and you think, what's the problem?  But the truth is, the print works here to help Jill build curves.  And the low plunge neckline...  Oh, they build curves.  In other words, she's a flatty, bushie.  You guys, you rock.  Thanks very much.  You got a bush in there, though.  It's something.  Yeah.  You're smuggling a fist.  Oh, my God.  That's ridiculous. 
[02:03:00]  They're trying to cover up a world of hurt.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, look at this.  Black covers up everything.  Wow, yeah.  Black is the new fat.  And JoJo's wearing a Baltex Empire Halter.  Look at that ass.  It's very chic, but it's very deceptive.  Under that armpit.  Power lining.  She drink patty water.  High leg mine.  Any woman brave enough to go on TV in this bathing suit and drink from my canteen anytime?  It's nearly droplet, but it has a little bit of a hurt when you're going there. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, boy.  And you don't get the feeling like you're losing your suit.  It's a lot of women do feel when you're hurting stuff.  Black covers up fat bellies.  That's what we're learning today on TV.  Great gay porn music.  All right.  We got the author calling in.  We have a guy I wanted to get on the phone today.  Ryan Ners, who wrote a really good book called Eat This about eating.  He was supposed to come in, but he didn't come in.  No, you don't get it.  It says, eat this book.  Eat this book. 
[02:04:00]  Ryan.  Okay.  Hold on.  Maybe.  Ryan.  Yes.  What's up, buddy?  How you doing?  Hey, Ryan.  You're an author?  I am indeed.  And you have a new book out?  Yes.  And were you supposed to come in studio with us today?  Yes.  What happened?  I do not know.  I woke up to three blaring alarms.  Yeah.  I'm very, very sorry.  Okay.  So the book, now this is obviously, a friend of ours does competitive eating. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  Who's that?  Pat from Munaki.  Oh, yes.  Of course.  I know Pat.  Turn this fucking mic on.  So did you actually, hold on.  Did you actually tour with these guys?  What's that?  Oh, okay.  Good.  Did you tour with these guys?  Yeah, I do.  Well, what exactly, what exactly, tell us about the experience a little bit.  Well, I mean, you know, I got, I wrote an article about a guy named Badlands Booker, who, uh.  Oh, we know him. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, hold on.  Wait, wait.  Yeah.  Is this?  Okay, go ahead.  Do you know who he is?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  He's a, he's a guy who, uh, looks like, um, a big, big, big black guy, 400 pounds.  Oh, yeah.  Conductor on the seven planes.  And, uh, he's got, he actually has two series of competitive eating themed hip-hop.  Don't, don't know if you've heard, uh, Hungry and Focus or not.  Oh, of course.  Yeah, he actually, uh, he actually, hold on.  Is he talked about here in this book? 
[02:05:30]  Um, he is.  He is indeed.  Uh, you also have a guy called the Emperor of Ice Cream.  It starts on page, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Wait, one, four, I don't have a page 115.  What, what is about this guy?  That's, that's Ed Cookie Jarvis.  He's also a good guy.  Cookie Jarvis, like Cookie Jar.  Oh, boy, that is to the end.  Oh, my God.  Well, where do they come up with the clever names?  Well.  Is what I want to know.  That's George Smith.  Hey, Ryan.  Ryan.  Yeah.  Why did you oversleep?  Why? 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  Why?  I mean.  We weren't important enough for you?  What happened, Ryan?  No, I swear, I swear.  I've, I've been a little sick.  I've been a little under the weather.  You know, I actually, I got to do the Daily Show last night.  Yes, yes.  Are you going to be sick for the Colbert Report tonight?  Hey, Ryan, I got, I got your book in my hand.  Yeah.  Cool.  And what, and what, what do you think?  This is what I think.  Oh, shit.  Come on.  Come on.  Get lost. 
[02:06:30]  Be nice.  That's what we do now.  I think that, uh, you could have done that without splashing milk all over me.  Yeah.  Who knew there was milk in the garbage?  Oh, Jesus.  Let's not clean this up.  Club soda.  Get out of the stands.  All right.  Why is it ringing?  I don't know.  It goes to the operator or whatever it does.  That guy.  Right.  Um, Jimmy, I'm really sorry. 
[02:07:00]  Why not?  I had no idea there was milk in there.  How you doing?  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  How you doing?  You don't oversleep.  Yeah.  Oversleep.  He's not oversleeping for the Daily Show or all the other fine programs out there.  He said he woke up to three blaring alarms.  Yeah.  That's called Get Up.  Then why didn't you call in?  Immediately.  Immediately.  Yeah.  Daily Show. 
[02:07:30]  You late for that one?  Thanks.  Colbert Report?  Of course not.  Late for that?  No.  Why?  But our little pissy show?  Yeah.  Now there's a problem.  Go screw.  That's what I say.  Not another mention of his book.  Strike it from the record.  It's struck.  So it is written.  So let it be done.  All right.  The Mets have a new theme song.  The Metropolitan.  Now wait a minute.  The Metropolitan.  I'm familiar.  The Metropolitan.  I'm familiar.  Best team in baseball, by the way.  With? 
[02:08:00]  I grew up as a Mets fan.  Metropolitans.  I'm familiar with the other song.  Meet the Mets.  Greet.  Greet the Mets.  This has to be the corniest organization in school.  Step right up and eat the Mets.  I don't know what you do with the Mets.  Greek the Mets.  That's what it should say.  Faggots.  Worst stadium in baseball.  And they're just corny.  Yeah.  They're cornballs.  That's why they don't have a good rep as one of the teams with a little bit of toughness or cred. 
[02:08:30]  Hello.  Hello?  Yeah.  What happened?  What happened there?  What do you mean?  What happened?  Who's this?  This is Ryan.  Wah, wah, penis.  Wah, wah, penis.  Wah, wah, penis.  Ryan.  He's a fag.  He's a fag.  I'm a fag?  Ryan.  Whoa.  Ryan. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, you like that, don't you faggot?  Ryan.  I just came to get something to eat.  Ryan.  Um.  Gotcha.  I'm a linda.  Ryan.  Yes.  Why are you calling the show?  Why am I calling the show?  Wah, wah, penis.  I thought I was supposed to be on the show.  Wah, wah, penis.  Oh, I give you the wah, wah, penis?  Does anyone know Ryan?  Ryan.  Wah, wah, penis. 
[02:09:30]  Wah, wah, penis.  Wah, wah, penis.  This is what I'd rather do than read your stupid book.  He stinks, and I don't like him.  He stinks, and I don't like him.  He stinks, and I don't like him.  He stinks, and I don't like him.  He stinks, and I don't like him. 
[02:10:00]  He stinks, and I don't like him.  He stinks, and I don't like him.  Grr.  He stinks, and I don't like him.  Goodbye, Ryan.  Oh, screw ass.  Go take a walk.  A long walk?  Off a short, off a short pier.  Right.  Hey, someone call Ryan back.  Obviously, we were kidding, and we should get a nice interview.  Yeah.  Can we get Ryan back on the phone?  Yeah, we just let him know that this is what we do. 
[02:10:30]  And we're just joking.  Yeah, that we're just joking around.  And some of the listeners might want to call in.  We want to promote the book.  Hello.  Hey, guys.  Ryan?  Yeah, how you doing?  We were just messing around.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  We're just fucking around with you, man.  Huh?  You just playing around?  We're just fucking around with you.  We don't give a shit you were late.  We don't give a shit that you didn't call.  We just fucked around.  If we could sleep in late, we would, too, my friend.  That's right.  Believe me.  We want to know a little bit about you, a little bit about the book, and this eating thing,  because we know Pat from Munaki, good friend of ours, good friend of the show. 
[02:11:00]  He was in the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest.  That's right.  He's done the other thing.  What is the other thing?  The ball, salty balls or something?  Yeah, there's a salty ball.  The potato things.  And then there's all kinds of things that I didn't even know of, like a bratwurst.  Yeah.  All kinds of eating competitions going on, and you're apparently part of this?  I am.  I'm an emcee.  I announce contests, so.  Do you actually participate in the eating portion of this, or you just announce it? 
[02:11:30]  Well, I did eat once against Kobe.  I'm going to deliver a line.  All right.  So you've participated in a few?  Yeah, I've done a few just for research, trying to figure out what it feels like, and  it doesn't feel good.  Did you even come close to placing or anything?  No, I got my ass kicked.  Yeah.  I was at six hamburgers when Kobayashi was at 36.  Wow.  I was terrible.  He ate 69 Crystal Burgers in eight minutes.  What do you think these guys got that you don't have? 
[02:12:00]  I don't know.  Some sort of jumbo esophagus and huge stomach capacity.  It's kind of hard.  I mean, you know, a lot of these guys train.  Yeah, so, uh.  Yeah, that's, uh, it's toughy.  You know, a lot of people don't really realize.  I wouldn't go as far, because some of them call themselves athletes.  I wouldn't go as far as that.  But they do stand alone.  I mean, it's not something everybody can do.  I mean, I would say, I mean, if you watch Kobayashi, I mean, I think that guy.  I've been fucking around long enough. 
[02:12:30]  I can't even carry on a conversation with this dude's back.  Let's get to the calls.  I muted the call.  Compare Kobayashi to Kobe Bryant.  I, uh, I delivered a line of good, but I think I might be proud of.  Yeah, uh, hey, we got a lot of people calling in, because they've been to a lot of these  contests.  It has blown up as a sport, which I don't personally get myself, but, but why don't we say hi to  Poe in, uh, Jersey here.  Poe.  Poe.  Gentlemen.  Poe, how you doing, bro?  I, uh, I do, is perusing this book, uh, is this, uh, Ryan? 
[02:13:00]  Yes.  How you doing?  Um, okay, thank you.  I eat a lot at, uh, Caroline's, because they, uh, I mean, the food is good there, and it's  free, so I go and eat, and compulsive overeating is a problem.  Do you think that the book might, uh, contribute to that, uh, at all, gentlemen?  Oh, that's a good question.  Um, when, you said what eating is a problem?  Uh, compulsive eating.  It's, that's actually a very good question.  I, I bet you you got some, uh, some detractors.  Yeah, there's definitely some people who, uh, who are concerned. 
[02:13:30]  Ramon, books about food should be written by Karen Carpenter.  Ramon, watch the record for cock sucking.  Ramon, staple my stomach.  Ramon, I'd rather read an AZT label.  Ramon, Ryan should oversleep because he's dead. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, my God.  My Lord.  All right.  Obviously, the, um, the call screener is, uh, screwing up on that one.  Uh, that was not, uh, the person we thought it was.  I thought it was Poe.  Yeah, what happened to Poe?  I don't know, because he actually asked a very Poe-like question about the food at Caroline's,  which kind of threw us.  Yeah, who saw that coming?  Something about, uh, the record for cock sucking is what I heard.  Yeah, yeah.  That guy occasionally gets through. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  And, uh...  Too bad, huh?  When we're trying to get serious questions only through the, uh, to the guests.  I actually don't know what the record for cock sucking is.  I don't know if that's in the...  Are you trying to make a joke out of a joke?  What's that?  Nothing.  I just didn't get where you were going with that.  No.  Like, how could you go anywhere with that?  It is what it is.  Well, thank you.  Any more, uh...  Well, I'm scared to go to the phones now.  I know. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  I just want to make sure.  They are, they have blown up, actually.  Let's see, let's say hi to, uh...  I don't, I don't even know who's on line six.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah, I just wanted to ask, uh, what do you think of Kobayashi's sister?  Isn't she a big-time eater?  Oh, there you go.  That's a good question.  Is that true, Ryan?  Kobayashi doesn't have a sister, but it's a good question.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, there is an Asian girl that does really well in the, uh, in the, uh, competitive eating contest.  Yeah, Sonya Thomas, the black widow. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, what's she about?  Uh, she's, she's kind of an enigma.  I mean, she ate 65 hard-boiled eggs in six minutes and 46 seconds.  Wow.  She, uh, she ate 11 pounds of cheesecake in nine minutes.  She ate 552 oysters in 10 minutes.  Wow, wow.  Um, she's, she's a different breed.  I don't, I don't understand her.  I don't understand exactly why she's doing it, but she's, um, she's a hundred-pound woman  who eats like a 400-pound man. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, let's, uh, let's, uh, take one more call here.  Steve from Yellowstone.  Steve, what's up today?  Hello, Ryan?  Yeah.  Hey, what is it, do you think it is that makes people able to eat like this?  Because, like, I can go out and, like, I actually, I, I can only eat a little bit because I had  to have my, my, my, uh, stomach stapled.  What makes people able to eat so much?  Well, I think one thing is that they have samples.  Ramone!  Ryan should dip my cock in water and shove it down his throat. 
[02:16:30]  Ramone!  Rumpelstiltskin sleeps less than this cocksucker.  Ramone!  It's funny when fat people die.  Ramone!  Kobayashi should eat bullets.  Oh, my God.  You know, the screeners today are really failing. 
[02:17:00]  I know.  Miserably.  Ryan?  Yeah?  Go, screw.  Oh, I missed one.  Oh, is that good, Jimmy?  I missed one.  I'm so mad.  Oh, God damn, is that funny?  Why didn't I say, Ramone!  Wawa penis!  Oh, so stupid!  Wawa penis!  Oh, so stupid!  Oh, brother.  Oh, yeah.  I think, I think Ryan's calling back to give us a thing or two.

[02:26:30]  cum on kelly pickler's chest joke  uh in there  very entertaining  that's all we can do with  uh kelly  kelly destroyed her uh  song last night  but she's too likable  to be kicked off  uh ace  gone  or that other guy  elliot  elliot  who i see  because he's called  that other guy  very uninteresting guy  uh gone  guy who's uncomfortable  in his own skin  either one of those  will be gone  uh  what's her name there  uh  paris  did a great job

[02:27:30]  uh the chick  the white chick  katherine uh  mcphee  mcphee  but i think  i think paris  will edge her out  paris is a better singer  and she's got  that kind of old  40s style  thing that people  seem to like  she's got the billy holiday  yeah  she's got a little billy holiday  in her  is she a black girl  yeah  uh yes  she's a  fine singer  yes  cool  here's the latest  house promo  next tuesday  it's a case  unlike any  you've ever seen  my bad  god talks to him 
[02:28:00]  one that has house  questioning everything  he's ever known  teenager  claims to the voice  of god  and people with  advanced degrees  are listening  not normal  there's nothing  in this universe  that can't be explained  eventually  god told me  no more  of man's medicine  you're watching  your son kill himself  you will believe  this diagnosis  house all new  9 8 central  next tuesday  on fox  be your discretion advised  what is house  gonna do  i won't believe  the diagnosis  again 
[02:28:30]  will i  i'll bet it's  your son's an ass  i wish it was  but it's always  some kind of  crazy illness  house  and then uh  than pointed out  something very  interesting about house  yep  for a couple of weeks  running  we've had anal  bleeding  on house  that seems to be  some kind of  maybe a running  theme they're trying  to get in there  because that says  nothing says  i'm really really  sick  more than  anal bleeding  you could  you could have  a runny nose 
[02:29:00]  a cough  a cold  earache  there's a multitude  of problems  that you could have  that would not  lead you to go  and seek medical  attention  the second you  have blood  coming from  your anus  you go to  the doctor  you know  you're in trouble  when you sneeze  and your underwear  looks like a red  paintball  and shot into it  you better get to  see mr house  get to house  jack in atlanta  jack  i could not believe  last night  a colonoscopy  on fox 
[02:29:30]  at nine o'clock  with the words  relax your anus  ma'am  relax your anus  all i could think  why don't we have  that clip for our show  we got that clip  uh...  you got to get it  sure  well than watched  the show  he actually watched  it last night  did you enjoy  house  shut up sir  we're talking  to fan now  you're done  thank you  by the way  a lot of  controversy  when we talk  about house  a lot of  people are like  i don't  i like house  dude i gotta  defend house  i gotta defend house  i'm not saying 
[02:30:00]  house is a bad  show  get that straight  it's just not a  show for me  and the promos  every week  i don't care how  big a fan you are  they all look the  same  well i'm saying  house is a bad  show and if you  watch it  you're a faggot  that's what i say  so last night  uh  there was uh  i just i watched  the first 30 seconds  it's one of those  shows you just want  to see how it  so you had to see  how it panned out  yeah  and the victim  was a lesbian  uh-huh  because they're  hip 
[02:30:30]  and um  yes she had  rectal bleeding  she had to have a  colonoscopy without  any sort of  anesthesia  now that's how  they house it up  yeah  normally  you'd be shot  full of valium  i guess  and they'd shove  a pipe up there  and see why  you're anally  bleeding  but on this  episode of house  without any  anesthesia  house shoves  a big pipe  up a chick's  ass  and could you  find a woman  with a tighter  ass than a  lesbian  couldn't it have  been a gay guy  where they just  throw a periscope  in  still on the  phone  the whole  submarine 
[02:31:00]  because house  is uh  still talking  at the doctor's  office  i'll be home  soon  he's typing  i-ming  nothing i haven't  had before honey  fucking small  pony runs out  that was a  problem  his hooves  were cutting  you  started to be  a big fan of  exaggerated humor  by the way  it is silly  of course  it's huge  to make sense  i said small  pony like a horse 
[02:31:30]  would have been  unbelievable  right  but a small  pony is realistic  you gotta keep it  realistic  sure  alright  so anal bleeding  colonoscopy  no anesthesia  why  why would house  decide it is  better to not  anesthetize somebody  getting a pipe  because they found  out that she was  although she'd been  up for 10 days  straight  uh-huh  she was sneaking  these 10 second  or you know  30 second naps  where she was  actually entering  stage one sleep  uh-huh  and house thought  that was a bad  idea  so just to find 
[02:32:00]  out what the real  problem was  he wanted to  deny her of this  little sleep  that she had  so to give her  why would house  think it's good  that she get no  sleep  i i don't know  what is wrong  with house  malpractice  why wasn't she  sleeping fam  was she drinking  too much coffee  what was happening  with the lesbian  it was a little  more complicated  than that  um first she  had to get a  liver transplant  from her lesbian  partner  well and that  seems to be a  running theme too  liver problems  always with the  liver on house  in order to  save the child 
[02:32:30]  the house  needs a liver  it's always some  big liver problem  or bleeding  from the ass  yes and they  had it all  uh last night  and um  there was a big  the big issue  that you might  have seen from  the promo  when he's like  if anybody  tells her  you're fired  yeah see now  they tease it  like that  if anyone  he's got a  staff in front  of him  if anyone  tells her  you're fired  and it's like  even i was like  who tells what  well the big  secret was that  the victim  uh wanted to 
[02:33:00]  break up with  her lesbian  partner  uh huh  but the  partner didn't  know that  but was willing  to give her  part of her  liver  but if she  breaks up  with her  she might not  want to fest  with the liver  and house  will lose  a patient  yes  house  never loses  a patient  no matter  what  wait we got a  reason why  they forced her  to stay away  Keith  alright  Keith  morning boys  hi sir  hi Keith  in midtown  reason  uh the reason  that house  wanted to 
[02:33:30]  uh  keep her from  having these  30 second  60 second  little naps  was he wanted  her to be  awake  so that she  would present  as many  symptoms as  possible  and if she  was denied  all sleep  that would  happen  so his  reasoning was  the quicker  we force  all the  symptoms out  the quicker  we diagnose  and treat  her  no what  happened  was  i saw  this one  when he  said if  you tell  her you're  fired  what was  happening  was um  as they  were doing  the probe  um  it wasn't 
[02:34:00]  a medical  instrument he  was putting  in her butt  and he  was worried  that someone  was going  to say  uh house  just fucked  you in the  ass  not as easy  to identify  if you're  very sleepy  absolutely  delusional  the medical  instrument spit  all over my  back  yeah yeah  no we know  you're tired  uh dan  new york  hey man  uh i love  the show  listen house  did have a  great throwaway  last night  where uh  the chick  on the show  said do you  have any idea  how much it  hurts to have  a big black 
[02:34:30]  pipe stuck  up your ass  and uh  house said  well no but  i have a  newfound respect  for the basketball  player you  hated in college  they really  said this on  house  yeah  a little  risque that  house  risque it  was  why would he  respect the  basketball player  yeah  for being able  to get her  to give up  the blue  knot  oh for getting  her  yeah  uh john in  delaware  john  yeah i was  uh watching  adult swim  last night  and they had  the perfect 
[02:35:00]  angry typing  guy on  they did  it was this  uh yeah it  was this guy  who was sitting  in the squalor  of his own  apartment  watching tv  reacts negatively  to what he  sees and just  does the exact  same voice  no that's not  true  oh now i gotta  send out an  email and put  it on a message  board  absolutely  perfect  sitting there  drinking a red  bull  his mom's  yelling from  the other  room  oh we gotta  get the audio  oh wait is he  that dumb  teenager who's  like got his  hat sideways  yeah but it  wasn't like the  claymation it was  actually like a  lot like a  yeah i saw him  i saw the guy 
[02:35:30]  which show was  it on do you  know  it was on a  robot chicken  no i understand  that but uh  all right we'll  have to just search  all the robot  chickens then  all right thanks  john  you're welcome  all right cool  righto  all right is that  it with house or  well just the big  secret was that  she actually the  victim had the  the plague  wait so after all  that yeah the  victim had the  plague she had the  bubonic plague she  needed a good night's  sleep yeah and house  kept her awake yeah  so and how do they 
[02:36:00]  cure that there's no  cure for that i think  they had some sort of  treatment yeah they  figured it out sometime  in about 1503 i think  they throw you in a  cart maybe even the  1400s i was thinking  about the uh the  Ebola virus right  well that would make  you a bleed from the  ass that's why i was  everywhere so the  bleeding uh from the  ass was from the  plague um that was  something to do with  uh liver failure and  why was the liver  failure because of the  plague yes oh okay but 
[02:36:30]  they couldn't figure it  out they had something  over technical  explanation and house  was like um because  she she got a plague  sore in about um an  hour yeah you know  and it was gigantic  and uh house was  making the analogy that  all the antibiotics and  stuff they were on um  was like a dam for all  the plague virus coming  in and so once they  got rid of the dam he's  like physics 101 water  rushes in so i guess that  means you instantly get  the plague how do you  use it an analogy for a 
[02:37:00]  medical problem like  that yeah it's only on  house he's just an  actor how did she get  just tonight he's not  a real type of  how did she get the  stupid plague you want  to know she would  yeah i think she went  down on coco the  gorilla did she go  somewhere no she just  got a new a new dog  from the southwest region  who brought oh she  got a new dog from  1300 i thought that  was the hunter virus  you got from the

[02:40:30]  wants me to  defend the mets  i don't feel like  it though  this is too good  all right so uh  this is the song  they're going to  play at every home  game at shea stadium  worst stadium in  baseball we said  that already  but best team in  baseball right now  by the way  uh the song is  called our team  our time 
[02:41:00]  and the song will  debut tonight at  the mets start  oh can't wait  as the mess as  the mets start a  three game homestand  against the alenta  and the braves  want to hear a  little piece of  our team  are you  bet i do  please  i'm afraid 
[02:41:30]  how are you  going to get the  white people  to come to the  stadium  yeah  have you looked  at mets fans  they're all  white  new york 
[02:42:00]  I think it's Cardinals Delgado.  He's at first base.  Cliff Floyd, Cardinals Beltran.  Playing the outfield.  Come to Shea Stadium.  Our team's the real deal.  New York Mets.  Our team, our time.  New York Mets.  Our team, our time.  Would you kindly shut your noise home?  Shut up!  You shut up!  You shut up!  That stinks.  And don't forget Tuesday is gold tooth and ankle bracelet day. 
[02:42:30]  Our team, our time.  It's just awful.  Looks like someone in the front office is a bit lazy.  Yeah.  Probably got a box of songs and went, ah, this is good enough.  This is good enough.  Fuck it.  You know, the Mets really, they are very white.  Like, the Mets fans are very white.  Yeah.  They really are.  Like Opie said, the brothers just aren't picking up on the logo.  They don't wear the hats.  They pick the worst blue possible. 
[02:43:00]  How do you wreck blue?  Blue is the easiest color to wear unless it's a Mets jersey.  They're trying to be, you know, New York, but it's really out on Long Island.  Stop it.  It's terrible.  Stop.  If my kids sang that song, I would beat them with a bat.  That's what I would do with them.  You should.  It's a horrid, horrid song.  New York.  Really trying to urban it up.  Yeah.  Can we team?  You know what the Mets theme song should be?  We're faggots.  Repeat.  Calm down.  How you doing? 
[02:43:30]  That's awful.  It's awful.  How you doing?  That wasn't an official Yankees song.  How you doing?  Those guys.  Yankees.  Yankees.  Da da da da da da da.  Right.  Yankees.  Yankees are consistent at least.  They don't try to change their image constantly.  The Mets are always trying to change their image.  How you doing?  Yeah.  Ugh.  It's awful.  But that's not bad.  But that's not.  No, but the Mets have always had theme songs.  The Yankees haven't.  Yeah.  The Mets.  How come they have a song?  Basketball teams or football teams don't have songs, do they?  It's all about the songs. 
[02:44:00]  Duke does.  See, this is what's going on.  Suck it or lose a tooth, bitch.  Baseball is all about the music now.  They're trying to make it more interesting.  So every time a pitcher comes in, he's got his theme song.  That used to be just a little thing that a few people did.  And now every single pitcher has their song.  Oh, no shit.  They come in, too.  I had to listen to a two-hour discussion on Mike and the Mad Dog about Enter Sandman  and how that's Rivera's song and how somebody else is using it.  And, you know. 
[02:44:30]  She's using it there, Maggie.  It's unbelievable that it's his home team here in New York.  You've got a guy coming out to the same song as Rivera.  Really?  Who gives a flying fuck?  Who really cares?  Why don't you just try to find out who really drank your wine that night on Long Island?  Somebody went over to the bar, broke into Mike's wine locker, and drank all of Mikey's wine.  I don't understand how this could happen in this day and age when there's supposed to be a locked door on there. 
[02:45:00]  How could another radio show come in and drink your wine, Mikey?  I don't know, dog.  $1,000 bottles of wine.  $1,000 bottles of wine behind our lock and key.  And very nice cigars.  Oops.  And two shock jocks drank your wine.  It's unbelievable, Mikey.  And passed out the cigars to the fans.  Dog.  Dog.  What a fat douche he is.  Oh, princess.  Ugh.  That dog.  Mike and a Mad Dog Show.  Why don't we do some Lady Di Cribs, homeless cribs? 
[02:45:30]  Oh, yeah.  You know, you watch shows on some of these, like HBO does them.  HBO does these shows perfectly.  They go into the dregs of society and do their documentaries.  Hookers.  All kinds of riffraff.  This was right up there.  Yes.  Because we know the person.  Lady Di.  If you don't know Lady Di, she found the show many years ago when we were on WNEW. 
[02:46:00]  Her and her friend, Marion, friends since high school.  They're now in their 40s.  And they had a little catchphrase.  They would say, yin-yang party, because that's what they used to say in high school.  Like, just two gals.  Just two gals.  And Marion's married.  She has a good life going for herself.  Her and her husband work. 
[02:46:30]  Lady Di was married.  Has a kid.  Kid is now living with her father, I gather.  And she's been a little down.  Down in the dumps.  And losing her jobs.  And just down on her luck, you would think.  She's been going downhill for 20 years.  But it's not her luck.  It's drinking, whatever else she's doing.  And she's using everyone else as an excuse.  Well, finally, she has hit bottom. 
[02:47:00]  And it is completely documented in this Lady Di Cribs from General Bam, of course.  Put this together.  And who else?  Sergeant Magoo.  And Sergeant Magoo, of course.  How could I forget?  I believe it's on Full Blown AIDS.  Sergeant Magoo.  It's on FullBlownAIDS.com.  You can download the videos.  And it is real.  It is raw.  It is wonderful.  You watch Lady Di.  Now, remember when she used to come in, when she was working?  She was working for Budweiser for some time.  For 17 years.  And we made fun of her then. 
[02:47:30]  She was a mess.  But at least she had clean clothes on.  And she had a home.  Good body?  No.  And she had a home.  Now, she is homeless.  She is living on a train platform behind a path mark somewhere in Jersey.  Oh, I used to live there.  Did you?  I know exactly where she lived.  You know that?  I did.  Chuck?  No.  Harlem.  A quick cock.  I was on the way to an AA meeting. 
[02:48:00]  I don't think she's reached bottom, though.  Really?  I think it's going to get worse.  She still isn't accepting responsibility, and she wants handouts from Wack Bag.  She knows that Wack Bag is up.  She dramatically looks into the camera and begs for you and I to help her.  And then the next scene is her chugging a beer, having a grand old time with the boys.  With the homeless.  With the boys.  And making out with the homeless guys.  Right.  With the Romeo of the railroad.  Is that what they're calling this guy?  Yeah.  The railroad Romeo, something like that. 
[02:48:30]  And she won't accept that she is responsible for this.  She's the one.  She is the one.  Drinking.  And now she's in the gutter.  I'm going to surprise a lot of people today.  I was sad.  I didn't even watch it.  I was sad.  Yeah, I don't know.  Bootstraps.  And I know that's a shock to some people, but it was...  Take your fat little fingers, shove them in your bootstraps, and pull your fat ass up by them. 
[02:49:00]  I had a tough time watching it.  Tough time.  I'm not going to help her, but...  It was great.  It was great.  It is a great documentary.  They just got to get music put behind it.  A little bit of music.  Yeah, they did a great job with it.  And then someone was suggesting that HBO guy at the beginning.  Lady Di, walk in the streets.  You know what that thing's like?  They show the hookers.  That was the hooker special.  Yeah.  You know music they should play behind it?  The music you used to play when you... 
[02:49:30]  Like the Oliver or the Laurel and Hardy music?  Do we do have that?  Yeah, somewhere.  That was my favorite sound clip ever.  Or the Benny Hill.  Benny Hill music.  Come on.  Anything but something depressing.  Something happy and jolly.  How about the Mets theme song?  Meet the Mets.  Greet the Mets.  Well, here's the first clip.  Lady Di, homeless cribs from General Bam and Sergeant Magoo.  We edited down some of the clips because some of them are long.  You can see the full version on fullblownaids.com, okay? 
[02:50:00]  Yep.  Here's...  I guess they're interviewing one of the homeless before Lady Di showed up.  Yep.  They lucked out.  They went to where Lady Di supposedly lives and stuff.  She wasn't around.  And all of a sudden, she showed up.  But first, it's an interview with one of her homeless friends.  I've known Lady Di for over 20 years.  At this time, she has drinking problems.  She's an alcoholic at this time.  And how long has Lady Di been here for?  Approximately a month and a half.  Her living conditions, as you can see, are plurible. 
[02:50:30]  It's very sad and very plurible.  Thank God they're not deplorable.  She had a child by one man who jumped in front of a train and killed himself.  A friend of Lady Di.  A friend of Lady Di.  Plurible meaning more than one.  Right.  There are two rails on the train tracks.  How are you? 
[02:51:00]  Whenever you walk in, they would play that stupid hearty face.  All right.  There are two rails on the train tracks.  Look out.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:51:30]  Time for Sergeant Magoo. Time for Sergeant Magoo to shine. Sergeant Magoo, what's up? 
[02:52:00]  Good morning, boys. How's everybody doing?  Hey, you guys did a great job at that homeless cribs.  Thank you. Thank you. The video doesn't even do it justice. You had to have been there in person.  Can I ask you guys a very, very simple question? Why film a homeless documentary on Lady Di in the middle of the night?  Because, you know, during the day they kind of scatter and, you know, they can't be seen around during the daytime.  They're kind of going out.  So you guys went there during the day?  No, no. We went there at night.  If you guys want to be good at this documentary stuff, you should have went during the day and then at night. 
[02:52:30]  During the day you get the scene and then at night you get the real interviews and then you're making it to something.  Because I was frustrated when I was watching the video because you guys were shining light on stuff, but it was really tough to see.  That's what I was about to say, yeah, because it doesn't do it justice.  I mean, at night it's when they're there the most because, you know, they're all drunk, of course.  But during the day they all scatter trying to find money, whatever they can do.  And, you know, they even told us that she hasn't been around all day. 
[02:53:00]  And right as we were getting ready to leave, we were filming the last part.  We were walking towards our cars and then, boom, she showed up.  Yeah.  Yeah, we got that audio.  All right, hold on the line, Sergeant McGill.  We might have some questions for you.  Yeah, at night it's hard to get homeless people in the daytime.  No, I understand, but at least go there during the day because I want to see, you know, what it looks like.  Oh, the living conditions.  Yeah.  Okay, good idea.  And then just take it to the interviews at night or whatever.  You know, right later that day.  Yeah.  All right.  Sorry, we just keep looking at this goddamn poor bastard in Vegas getting his ass beat by a gang of black guys.  They weren't all black, I don't think, though. 
[02:53:30]  No?  It's nice to see white and black people work together to beat up a poor fucking security guy at a Vegas casino.  But he's definitely.  Like, this guy's life isn't bad enough.  Like, this guy's life isn't bad enough.  Look at the sucker punch.  Oh, man.  Black people are the best sucker punchers ever.  And now a little kicking.  Not one racial mention, though.  I mean, in the news.  Some stomping, a little beating with a belt.  They're stomping the guy's head.  Now, why are you doing that just for fun? 
[02:54:00]  Ah, you know.  Is that him?  Oh, it's a cop.  Okay.  What happens in Vegas?  Stays in Vegas.  There you go.  Broken jaw.  Just a gang of hoods.  I'd love to know why is there no racial mention.  Why?  Are there chicks getting in on it?  Yeah.  The whole culture.  This guy.  Look at this.  Oh, my God.  Look at this.  Animals.  Why is the racial angle not mentioned?  It just annoys me.  White guy just sitting there in his stupid little golf cart, security golf cart.  Well, is he a white guy?  I can't see him.  He's a white guy in the golf cart. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, yeah.  He's a bloody white guy.  Wearing a little security uniform.  They're stomping him.  They stole his cell phone and his radio.  Oh, he's getting up.  He gets up, though.  He's like Rocky Balboa.  Yeah.  Come on, Creed.  Here they go.  Don't want no hair.  He's been missing in my corner.  Whoa.  And he gets up and staggers back.  He's a tough dude, though.  With his broken jaw.  Looks around.  Ugh.  And cars just drive by.  And look at these guys drive by like, hey, I don't know.  I'm looking for the fucking blackjack table.  Yeah.  Thank God that's over with. 
[02:55:00]  It's a golf cart.  What was the motive there?  It wasn't robbery.  Like, apparently it wasn't a hate crime in New York.  Well, the...  Because the motive was robbery.  That group of young thugs walked past his golf cart.  One of them reached in and took his radio out of the car.  And he said something.  Must have been like, excuse me, sir.  Could you please give back my radio?  Why are you taking my radio?  Why are you taking my radio?  Like, you have to say something when they take your radio.  That's mine. 
[02:55:30]  And then, yeah.  And then they decided to punch the shit out of him.  Yeah, that's how it works.  Well, this is the beauty of this.  That's how you get respect.  This is the beauty of the show.  If you go right to Vegas and see how they're handling this story.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Yeah, you may not be getting the racial angle there, but here it's left, right, and center.  It's all they can talk about.  Good.  The best part, though, was the lady on the TV last night going,  we'll keep showing you this video until we can identify these people.  And then they just show it over and over.  I think they showed it probably about four or five times in a row. 
[02:56:00]  Can I point out why the media is doing that?  They don't give a shit if they ever catch these guys.  It's great video.  It's great TV.  And, you know, that's how they're justifying playing it a million times  because we're trying to do good with our news program.  People love seeing people get beat up on TV.  It's a great clip for them.  Punch it out, boys.  Later.  All right.  I thought because he was in a golf cart and they were all out-of-work caddies.  And they were pissed out.  Oh, that's these goddamn golf carts.  Well, what do you expect?  A bunch of golfers. 
[02:56:30]  So is he allowed to join the gang now?  He's been beat in, right?  Yeah, you got to be beat in.  You got beat in, all right.  The girls are hitting them.  They're just...  Again, I wouldn't mind...  Equality, man.  Okay.  Poor bastard, man.  It's the 90s.  Yeah.  Poor bastard.  No racial mention.  Let the...  If there was a gang of white kids...  Well, we don't know, Jimmy, because we don't have the TV on.  No, I don't.  It was black.  Oh, but you're just assuming, right?  Working together.  Yeah.  You're assuming, and you're probably right.  Just from what I've read online, I'm saying. 
[02:57:00]  You're probably right.  Just from what I've read.  Yeah.  Let's go to the second clip.  It's Lady Di Homeless Cribs from General Bam and Sergeant McGill.  FullblownAids.com has the entire video.  Here's the second clip.  Interview with a guy who has slept with Lady Di.  Ends with a rival of Lady Di.  You've had sex with Lady Di?  Yeah.  Because she woke up one day with her pants down her ankles and a ponytail.  No, she didn't even remember, though.  She wasn't the only one.  You weren't the only one? 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  How many others would you say?  One, two, three, four.  That you know of.  I mean, you know.  Six.  Six total.  One, two.  About six.  Three.  About six.  Lady Di is going to know.  Three.  Three, I know for sure.  Three, you know for sure?  Yeah.  I know six.  You know six for sure?  She knows.  I know six.  You tell her more.  I know more.  Do you use a condom or?  No.  She got dried and wet.  She got dried and wet.  She would say it was.  Good?  Better than good?  Or outrageous? 
[02:58:00]  Oh, great.  Oh, you would say you broke the bed.  You broke the bed.  We broke the bed.  What do you mean?  Wait.  Wait.  What the fuck was that?  That sounded like Lady Di.  What?  Lady Di!  There she is!  Lady Di!  There she is!  Lady Di!  Killer!  They'll like chase her down with pitchforks.  Their pussy has a ride.  Yeah, I know.  Their chick.  What happened to her?  She's the only girl there.  Six in a row?  I don't understand.  Was she raped or it was consensual?  She just woke up with her pants down? 
[02:58:30]  She's a mess.  All right.  She's a mess.  Did the guy say, now, no protection.  Did he say at one point it was a little dry?  Yes.  Did you call that?  He was number two.  Said about it being dry, then wet.  Dry, then wet.  Oh.  She went through periods of enjoying it.  Oh, yeah.  And then reality sunk in for that split second before she took another swig.  Yeah.  It's wet when she has to relieve herself properly.  Jesus.  Oh.  Now, Rich, you've been at the bottom of the barrel years ago. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, I think he was also a bottom.  But what was that, 20 years ago, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you were at the bottom.  Anything even close to this where, I mean, she's lost her son.  The most they'd ever fucked me were four.  And they had homes.  Well, you know what?  It's funny because everybody's bottom.  You know, you ask anybody that is, you know, my bottom was just my bottom.  It was horrible.  You just can't, you know, she.  Doesn't that seem like a bottom right there?  If you're on a mattress under a train platform in Jersey getting fucked by a homeless guy without a condom. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, you break the bed and you're just drinking.  Isn't that how, where's more of a bottom than that?  He could have been black.  He's strong, he's this black guy.  I couldn't have been black.  We could go further.  You know what?  She's probably just gave up.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  How old's her son?  Is her son or daughter growing up, you know?  He was 12, like what?  About 12, right? 
[03:00:00]  No, he was 12 a couple of years ago.  So he's got to be in early teens, probably mid-teens.  I mean, think about this lady.  Her husband.  It wasn't her husband, I don't think.  Well, still, she has a baby.  The father of her child.  The father of her child.  Threw himself in front of a train.  In front of a train.  So that can't be too, you know, good on her self-esteem.  That must be great.  Every time she's sleeping and hearing that chugger, chugger, chugger, chugger.  Shoo, shoo.  17 years.  Going by her, just bringing up nice nightmares.  Not everybody spirals down to that extent.  I mean, people go through hardships. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  So she was drinking even when she was working, right?  Yeah, she worked at Budweiser for 17 years.  She should sue Budweiser.  Think how much Bud stock would have been up if she didn't work there.  Just pilfering.  Think how much of the inventory she drank.  Think she's still on it?  Well, there's a whole thing in the documentary about her working there for 17 years and then  getting let go.  But she doesn't even, she's not even honest with that.  She can't be honest.  She's a compulsive liar is another one of her big problems. 
[03:01:00]  Well.  Isn't that because of the addiction?  Like, aren't you a liar?  Probably.  I wasn't addicted when I lied to you.  Oh.  What are you lying about?  Wearing a condom.  Oh.  All right, here we go.  What about car?  Here's the third clip.  Lady Di explains how long she's been homeless, begs for O&A to help, then makes out with Romeo  of the Railroad.  Romeo of the Railroad.  Lady Di, so how long have you been, how long have you been staying out here for?  Since last month, maybe.  You know, but before that, I've been homeless since November. 
[03:01:30]  Open hand me, please, you've got to help me out.  You have to help me out.  Because I don't know how much longer I could live like this.  Who is the Romeo of the Railroad?  No, they call me, uh, what was it, Romeo of the Railroad.  They call him Romeo of the Railroad.  Romeo of the Railroad.  Romeo of the Railroad.  Can we find him?  Are you two, you know, intimately involved with each other?  Or, on a mutual, on an adult basis, you know, not anything nasty or anything. 
[03:02:00]  He's been keeping...  Like adult school, right?  More or less.  You've had sex with Lady Di?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's funny.  Go Romeo of the Railroad.  There goes Romeo of the Railroad.  There you go.  There goes Romeo of the Railroad.  Obviously, they're making out at that point.  Bless you.  Yeah, they were, uh, making out, drinking beers.  Um, she's filthy in this whole thing, too.  Really filthy.  Like, it almost looked like makeup dirt. 
[03:02:30]  Like, like, from a movie where you would smear it all over your face like soot or something  to make yourself look dirty.  That's how badly, uh, she was just filthy.  She's got to be in her mid-40s.  Why don't you help her out by getting her in her rehab or something?  That's how you help her.  We've tried.  We've tried so many times.  She won't even do that.  We've had guys in the program that want to, you know, help her out.  And they're trying to get her to a meeting.  And she says, yeah, you know, I'm going to be there.  I'll be there.  And then we hear from the guy.  Hey, she never called, never showed, never did. 
[03:03:00]  She just doesn't, she doesn't want it.  And now she, now she wants to dip into the Wackbag.com charity.  Now, Wackbag has been very good to people like, uh, Patty.  Stalker Patty.  Pat.  Patty makes an effort.  Pat from the Nacchio thing as well.  She's retarded and misguided, but she, she means well.  And she knows that she has to support herself and pay rent and stuff.  Uh, and she tries, but sometimes she gets behind just because of her jobs or something.  And Wackbag got together and came up with a couple of grand for her. 
[03:03:30]  To pay her back rent.  That's fine.  Pat from Nacchio lives in a shithole.  Wackbag was there.  Wackbag's like the Red Cross for retards.  That's unbelievable.  It's amazing.  And now she comes on, calls up the other day.  And she's saying, uh, I just need Wackbag, you know, you guys for money.  And you know what?  Ask for it.  Uh, and, and she's asking, and where would it go?  Where would it go?  Boop.  She would drink it right down.  Drug.  She'd get mugged.  She'd be, you know, fucked. 
[03:04:00]  Look for it.  Here's, here's the guy that tried to help her actually.  Jim in Brooklyn.  Jim.  What's going on guys?  I turned around and saw the videos.  Um, I think it was Monday night.  They went up.  Are you surprised?  Um, I'm not really surprised, but it really, I got to agree with OPA.  It kind of, um, bothered me watching it.  And I'm almost tempted to go look for a Friday night and see if I can't get her to go back  in rehab.  That rehab that Diana said she was in, uh, that, um, Marion said she was in. 
[03:04:30]  Wait, she, how long was she in rehab for?  Huh?  How long was she in for?  Marion said she was in rehab for, like, no time.  And then she just left.  Well, you could go to almost any detox for five days.  Yeah.  For, like, you know, without insurance and stuff, right?  I think that's what she said was, I think she said she was, like, there for, like, five  days.  I don't, I don't have, uh, Marion's number anymore, so I can't call her and find out.  Yeah, there she is.  She said that, uh, she was working at Dunkin' Donuts and she wasn't making enough money  there to pay her $1,000 a rent, uh, a month rent that she was, uh, I think she said she 
[03:05:00]  was making $6.25 an hour.  Yeah, she was making $6.25 an hour.  She was clearing, like, a couple hundred and change or something.  You could get a roof over your head for a lot less than a $1,000 a month.  You could get a roof over your head.  Yeah.  And then they were, they asked her, well, then why did you quit Dunkin' Donuts?  And she goes, I just didn't feel like, you know, going or something.  It wasn't even, she didn't even have a reason for it.  She just gave up.  She pretty much, the woman has given up.  Well, so you know how you could really help her and kill two birds. 
[03:05:30]  Maybe next year, throw one to the homeless shopping spree.  Well, she will be a member of it if she is still alive.  All right, Jim, thank you.  Let's go to Roadkill.  Roadkill.  Yeah, how you doing?  Hey.  Listen, I just wanted to tell you guys, uh, if you guys even think, or the people from  Wack Bay even think about helping this piece of garbage out.  In all honesty, you're going to have every piece of crap from coast to coast calling  you guys for a dime.  It's not even helping.  If it was helping, it would be one thing. 
[03:06:00]  We know it would just be giving money to someone who's going to spend it on booze and or drugs.  I think they should chip in and buy her a thing she has no use for, like a case of flip-flops.  Or something she just can't use.  Kerchips.  Absolutely.  Actually, how about a gift certificate for one trip to Dr. Kevorkian?  You did not do it.  Dr. Kevorkian.  I didn't hear what he said.  What did he say?  A trip to Dr. Kevorkian?  I said a gift certificate for one, good for one trip to Dr. Kevorkian. 
[03:06:30]  I can't believe he said it again.  Is she the only girl living out at this homeless, with all these homeless people there?  Yeah, I think she's the prize.  She's never been the pretty girl before.  She's the chick now.  All right, why don't we play the next clip?  Lady Di explains the broken bed and her drinking.  Oh, God.  The full-length video is on fullblownaids.com.  Is there a reason why that bed is broken? 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  You used a couple of times.  Have you been fucking too much?  Poor heart.  He broke it.  Thank you, baby.  I'm the one that brought it up here.  Yeah, well, I re-broke it.  I made $6,000.  Hey, how much was the rent?  $1,000 a month.  How much are you making it on your donut thing?  $6,15 an hour.  $6,15 an hour, too.  About maybe $200 something a week.  No one was able to help you out?  Parent or dad? 
[03:07:30]  Lady Marion?  No, Marion did help me out a couple of times.  Earlier, Marion was here.  And you two were in a fight.  Is that true?  Right down the street.  She was fighting with me.  I'm not fighting with her.  I mean, be honest with us, because we're kind of...  She turned around and she told me I put myself in my own predicament right here.  You're saying you didn't?  No, how can I?  Was drinking an issue also that took up a lot of your money?  No, I don't know.  How much are you spending a week on alcohol? 
[03:08:00]  I don't know.  Should I be honest about this?  Absolutely, be honest.  Yeah.  Okay, $10 a day.  On alcohol?  $10 a day.  Jugs of wine every day.  $10 a day.  Is that why you lost your job?  Because you're drinking?  No.  No, I just decided not to go back.  That's all.  That's all.  There you go.  $10 a day for drugs and alcohol.  That means there's more than that.  Yeah, that means it's more. 
[03:08:30]  She's not using probably the best stuff.  She's not sipping cognac.  No.  Yeah, but even if they say can, it's $15 or $20 easily.  So she's getting those big jugs of wine and just sitting there, getting hammered, and  then getting fucked by the homeless.  Wow.  And every once in a while, she'll wipe the hobo cum off her face.  That awful crotch must smell so she can panhandle.  Oh my God.  That is horrible.  Taking dumps, wiping with a leaf.  Oh my, look at this. 
[03:09:00]  This is just wrong.  Cigars and scotch.  Hey, there actually is a Help Lady Dice thread on Wackpeg, and people have been very,  very generous so far.  Are you kidding?  So you're going to hand her money?  What is that going to do?  We have pledges for a house, money, a car.  There's a lot of things in that thread.  But do you know what she will do with this?  Have you read the thread?  No.  She needs to go.  She needs rehab.  Oh, okay.  All right, is that one?  Oh, all right.  All right, they're not serious. 
[03:09:30]  Those wacky pranksters over at Wackpeg.com, huh?  Let's go to Doug out, Doug.  Doug.  What's up, guys?  Hi, Petunia.  Rich Voss, May 5th, Virginia Beach.  I'll be there with wow stickers.  I canceled it.  Of course you did.  Did you miss your plane this time?  No.  No, we had to move it.  I'm doing a private party.  Didn't you read it on the...  I put it on Wackpeg.  Of course he's canceled.  Hey, if Wackpeg is the retard Red Cross and full-blown AIDS is the point-at-you-in-last message  board, if that guy, John, the guy that wanted to help her, if he PMs me, General Bam, or 
[03:10:00]  Sergeant Magoo on the message board, there are full-blown AIDS, we'll be more than happy  to go out there with the camera and watch the rescue effort.  Rescue effort.  Well, that'd be nice to document.  Yeah, definitely.  I'd like to see that.  That's a good part.  If the part one was well-received and the part two attempted rescue, so we can watch her  try to lie her ass off again to somebody else.  Yeah, the website's blowing up. 
[03:10:30]  We kind of started talking about it on our show.  This is like an experience, this show.  It doesn't end with the radio show, and you guys have taken it upon yourself to build on  that concept.  The website is blowing up.  If you want to go out and help out, let one of us know.  We'd love to go with you and document the travesty.  All right.  Yeah, you guys got to get more video of her, I guess.  Thank you, Doug.  There he goes.  Here's the fifth look.  Wow, did she look dirty.  She looks like a chimney sweep.  Is that a fucking clown nose on her? 
[03:11:00]  Jesus.  Look at her.  Is that dirt, or is that like alcohol poisoning?  Because the last time I saw her, she had a really, really bad red nose.  She looks awful.  She's preparing for the brown lesions.  She's cute.  And then here's the rest of the homeless guys, the vultures, that are just picking off  her flesh at night.  Do you think she's like a 10 in the hobo community?  No.  She's a 4 in the hobo community. 
[03:11:30]  She's a pussy in the hobo community.  Yeah.  She's a hot pocket.  Hot pocket.  Ew.  All right, here we go.  The next clip.  This is where Lady Di is making out with, we're watching video of her making out with  a homeless guy, and as the homeless guy grabs her ample ass.  You know what's sad is, Norton's going to blow up tonight with sunglasses on.  Yeah.  Is Lady Di around?  I got a jug of wine.  Here we go.  She explains Budweiser firing. 
[03:12:00]  How did you lose your job with Budweiser?  Come on, be honest.  Tell us the truth.  That's a really soft issue right there.  Soft.  I had the job 17 years.  I know.  And it hurts that they fired you.  Why?  Let your story be known.  Did you mess up?  Because I had a back pain.  I went to see the nurse, and when I went to see the nurse, they decided, instead of me 
[03:12:30]  seeing the nurse, they decided, okay, she's going to sue the place, and to just say, bye-bye.  That's it.  That's it.  How did you clean yourself up?  I mean, where, I mean, do you have showers, do you have...  Two days ago, I took a shower over my dad's house.  Yeah.  Yesterday, I took a shower, not really a shower, but I washed up over a friend's house.  Which he's not here right now.  You talked to, they talked to him on the phone yesterday. 
[03:13:00]  Frank.  Okay.  Are you romantically involved with Frank?  No.  Sexually involved?  Well, you know what?  Everyone, everyone is human.  I don't know.  Not you.  I don't like her explanation for Budweiser.  My back hurts.  You're fired.  You're fired.  My backache.  Why, I ought to...  I heard stories.  I don't know if they're true, but rumor had it that she did. 
[03:13:30]  Have some kind of back issue.  Went to the company nurse or whatever they have over at those breweries.  And they just smelled alcohol all over her.  And out the door she went.  They probably don't take kindly to alcoholics at Budweiser.  No, drinking at Budweiser, yeah.  What circles you hang with that you're hearing rumors about?  I know.  Actually, I heard from a very close friend of hers.  I've been drinking. 
[03:14:00]  That's Budweiser.  That's a soft issue, too.  On the ground railroad.  Soft issue.  That's a soft issue.  Let's talk about the six guys that banged me.  Yeah.  That was all right.  How did anybody hurt it?  But our back's hurting now.  Five guys banging on railroad ties.  Oh, God.  That'll leave a kink in your back or two.  How old is their son, did you say?  Mid-teens, probably.  And what's he?  Something wasn't quite right about him, either. 
[03:14:30]  But we don't know what it is.  Fetal alcohol syndrome.  We don't know what it is.  You know something?  Now that might make sense.  He was a little off.  We met him?  Yeah.  Remember she brought him in one day?  Does he have wide-set eyes and a...  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was something.  The kid, he seemed bad.  Was he the guy that was eating the glue?  Kind of retarded.  I don't know.  We put him in a corner.  He ate some paste.  He giggled.  He left.  Well, fetal alcohol, what happens is it's holes in the brain.  So you don't know how it's going to manifest itself really later on in life.  How do you know this?  My sister's head of fetal alcohol syndrome charity in Canada. 
[03:15:00]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  It's funny.  She thinks everyone has fetal alcohol syndrome now.  Like, you know what I mean?  She's around it too much.  Now she just calls it fetal syndrome?  She told me in all seriousness that she thinks that George W. has fetal alcohol syndrome.  Oh, really?  I said, you should put him on your website.  Did she ever examine, you know, your other half? 
[03:15:30]  He said tortillas?  Look at that brain.  Let's take a look at his history.  How many drinks did she say?  That's just stupid.  It's totally different.  How many drinks does she say, does it?  They don't know.  That's why they think.  They just don't know.  They just don't know.  How come some of the most brilliant minds in our world ever were born and did these great things before we ever knew?  And, you know, women were drinking like crazy.  Like, all of a sudden pops out an Alvin Einstein. 
[03:16:00]  Well, because not every baby that mother drank has fetal alcohol.  It's just a crapshoot.  And maybe the alcoholism develops later.  But what about the holes in the brain?  That's what I'm saying.  Think how smart Einstein would have been if his mother didn't drink.  See?  Maybe the holes.  Maybe he didn't get holes in his brain.  Like, maybe she just happened to drink at times when his brain wasn't being formed in the womb or whatever it is.  All right.  That sounds reasonable.  I don't know.  So you could drink between when and between growth spurs. 
[03:16:30]  Maybe she took a lot of folic acid.  When you feel the baby kick, grab a shot.  When a lady's pregnant, what semester does she have to be in for the baby?  It's a trimester.  Did you please tell me?  I was shocked at hearing that.  That was to be ironic.  No.  He was being funny.  No, he wasn't.  He was being funny.  He was being rich boss.  No, he wasn't.  He was being boss.  You meant to say trimester.  What semester.  You know what I was talking about.  You know what I'm talking about.  What semester.  He was serious. 
[03:17:00]  Yes, he was.  No, he wasn't.  Don't defend him.  It brings you down to his level.  He's joking around.  She's not defending him.  This is her whole life on the line.  My husband couldn't have just done semester.  He was kidding, weren't you, honey?  An alcoholic chick is more articulate than he is.  You guys want to hear the next Lady Diaclip?  Of course.  Can I pee while you're playing?  I have to go badly.  I can't wait.  You're such a bait.  Dude, my bladder.  I can't do it.  I have a bladder.  I was diagnosed.  With what?  Bladder infection?  No. 
[03:17:30]  Put a breathe right strip on your dick.  Just like seal it right over the tip.  What were you diagnosed with?  I want to know.  Cuteness.  And there's no cure.  And it really makes you pee.  It's chronic tea.  Okay.  Go urinate.  Here we go.  The next Lady Diaclip.  Lady Diaclip says she just wants support.  And then she proceeds to chug a beer with her pals.  A lot of people would say, and a lot of jokes would go around, that you're a waste of life.  You don't do anything. 
[03:18:00]  You're homeless now.  You're drunk.  That is not true.  You're worthless.  You're, you know, they'd say that there's absolutely no point to your life anymore.  You've done nothing with it.  Your son's living with your parents.  You can't even take care of your kid anymore.  The only thing I can say is, you know, I need help.  That's that.  What do you want from the people?  I just want their support.  All right.  Wow.  I just want their support.  And then she starts chugging a beer. 
[03:18:30]  She means money.  Yeah.  And she's chugging.  Chugging a beer, yeah.  Chugging and making out with homeless people.  All right.  Then the guys got her to do some panhandling outside the Pathmark or the Dunkin' Donuts.  I get shit for that every time, and no one can take a joke.  Yes, Justin?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hi.  How are you?  What's on your mind?  I'm wondering, who the hell is Alvin Einstein?  The guy with the theory of relativity.  Alvin?  Alvin.  Alvin Einstein. 
[03:19:00]  Ah, that's brilliant.  Have you been checked for a fetal alcohol syndrome?  What's the problem, sir?  I'm sorry.  You don't know your geniuses through history?  I've heard of a guy named Albert.  I think Alvin was his little brother.  Albert?  He had some chipmunk friends.  Who is that?  I don't know what that is.  It's Alvin Einstein.  It always has been.  You know, I've used that same stupid joke 8,000 times, and some idiot will always call me  out on, dude, it's Albert, not Alvin. 
[03:19:30]  Don't you get the irony?  You're talking genius, and I get the name wrong.  Asshole.  I didn't even know you got the name wrong.  I wasn't even kidding.  Fucking rich.  You're a thinking man's comic.  You're a thinking man's comic.  I try.  You make the people think a little bit.  A little.  Very little.  All right, here we go.  Lady Di begs for change outside Dunkin' Donuts or Pathmark, what have you.  Here we go.  Can you spare any change, please? 
[03:20:00]  I'm homeless.  Any change?  I'm okay.  I'm going to get some.  Thank you.  Hi, hon.  Can you spare any change, please?  I'm homeless.  Any change?  What are you trying to get?  Something to eat?  Something to drink?  What are you trying to get?  Something to eat or something to drink?  Just change.  What are you trying to get?  Something to eat or something to drink?  Lady Di, go get whatever you need.  Thank you, baby doll.  Have a good one.  You too much.  I'm a beast.  So she's standing out in front of a convenience store panhandling. 
[03:20:30]  Acting it up, by the way.  And the guy was like, you know, what is it?  Something to drink or something to eat?  Because he was going to buy it for?  Yeah.  Because the homeless is going to be honest to you.  Yeah.  I was thinking of getting a burger.  I like how she goes into her Jimmy acting voice.  Do you think you could give me some change?  I'm homeless.  That's how women are.  Yeah.  I'm really manipulative.  At Penn Station, like when I was down there, I was at Penn Station and I had no money.  I was starving.  And I had like a calling card or, you know, like a spread, whatever back then. 
[03:21:00]  And people are going to make a call.  I go, look, give me the quarter and I'll dial the number for you.  Trying to get money.  You know what I mean?  Right.  Just doing whatever you can, you know.  How did that work?  I think I got like 75 cents or whatever.  I don't know.  And what would you do with 75 cents?  Try to get a hot dog to hold me over.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just a, it's kind of an hour by hour life.  Yeah.  Is that it?  If you could satisfy yourself for an hour, then you're okay?  Well, I would try, that was to get on the train to get back to Jersey. 
[03:21:30]  I wouldn't have money.  So I would just get on the train and dodge the conductor, you know, before I get back  to my...  Conductor and I'm dodging him.  That must look like some kind of fucking video game.  You're just roaming around the train trying to dodge the conductor.  Taking this shit for eight stops.  Jeez.  Would he catch you?  Sometimes?  No.  No?  You were good at it?  No.  I think one time I got caught and they just let me...  I didn't know.  They looked at me.  You could just look and go, ugh. 
[03:22:00]  Then I would get home and then go to the hot dog stand and try to get hot dogs on credit  from him.  And then just start over.  That's not healthy, Rich.  No, I know.  Hot dogs and crack is a really bad diet.  Diet, yeah.  Let's say hi to Blind Dave.  Blind Dave?  Hey.  Hey.  I hope she gets sober, straightens her life out, gets it all together, and then finds out she  has AIDS.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I was like...  I did think at the beginning of that call that it was out of character for one of your 
[03:22:30]  calls.  Oh, wow.  But what a scenario.  She finally gets on her feet.  But that was in one of those interventions.  Do you ever watch that show?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I love the intervention.  I'm addicted.  If you want to be depressed, that's the show for you.  But one of those guys, he was a math addict, and when he got cleaned out, he found out he  had AIDS.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Hey, congrats.  Why don't you just go right back to math at that point?  Might as well. 
[03:23:00]  You have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  I hate to tell you, boy, that you have AIDS.  You got the AIDS.  You may have caught it when you struck that filthy needle in here.  Or maybe all that unprotected sex puts you here.  It isn't clear, but what we're searching of is you have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  Not HIV, but full-blown AIDS.  I'm sorry, I wish it was something less serious. 
[03:23:30]  But if it's AIDS, you've got the AIDS.  What is that from?  It's Family Guy.  Family Guy.  They actually play that on television. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah.  Cool.  On, yeah, what, Fox?  Wow.  That is great.  All right, we got the last Lady Di clip.  The full version's on fullblownAIDS.com.  Yeah.  Lady Di says the cops scare her, and then she got mugged.  Yeah.  They scare the fuck out of me.  Who does?  The cops.  Why?  Because that's what they do.  They scare the fuck out of me.  Have the cops hurt you?  No.  Have the cops mugged you on the railroad tracks?  No.  Who has them? 
[03:24:30]  Somebody else.  Who?  The guy who's supposed to be your friend?  Yeah.  Please help me out.  I've got to get out of these streets.  I have to get out of these streets.  That's all there is to it.  All right.  We'll leave it to you.  Take care, hon.  Bye.  Have a good night.  Oh, we're sorry.  Yeah.  So sorry.  Should we play Press Your Luck?  Good thing she has.  And decide.  Satellite radio.  Should we play Press Your Luck? 
[03:25:00]  Press Your Luck?  She got the whammy, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, there it is.  If you want to see the video, fullblown8s.com.  Check it out.  Download it.  Watch it.  It's a...  Is it a series, by the way?  Yeah.  It's like a five-part series.  No, I mean, is there going to be new episodes?  I hope so.  I want to see it in the daytime.  That's a good suggestion.  I want to see if they send the guy to help her.  Maybe that interview caught on tape.  I'd like to see the whole thing put to some kind of soundtrack. 
[03:25:30]  I think music could really bump up the emotion level.  This could be the first Opian Anthony TV show.  Yeah.  I think it should be a series.  I think they should film some more episodes.  It's great.  I actually have...  I'm actually going to see her.  When?  This Thursday, Friday, Saturday in Chicago.  At Zaney's.  Thursday is the downtown location.  Friday is St. Charles.  And Saturday is Vernon Hills.  Vernon Hills.  I could not have walked into that better.  Well, who cares?  Where?  When?  Yeah, just my Chicago dates. 
[03:26:00]  Don't get crazy.  I'll be there.  I'll be there.  How are you?  How are you?  Who does the weekend when you're doing the other clubs?  Like, I don't understand how that works.  We did that tour.  They just bounce you all over the place.  I know, but when you're not at the club...  You're at the downtown club.  They probably have three different headliners.  I'm guessing they have three different headliners, and they rotate you in three different clubs.  You're inside the comedy mind right now, people.  You're hearing discussions on how these gigs are sorted out on the weekends.  Too small to get headliners in there for that kind of game.  I can't afford to pay you, so they put you in three.  Boring.  Boring. 
[03:26:30]  No, no, it's a good part.  And what will happen is you have to...  The hotels are different, because everyone wants to travel, but nobody...  But now you have to pack up every single night.  Good morning.  I just live out of my suitcase.  I've been in, like, a poor...  Sergeant McGoo was on hold that whole time.  So, Sergeant, thanks.  Hey, it's all good.  Are you guys going to do more episodes?  We definitely are.  We've already got stuff planned and dates planned, and we're going to be getting some more people  down there to make the next one even that much better.  You guys should get, like, a cheerleading squad to give her a nice cheer that she could 
[03:27:00]  do it.  Oh, my God.  Aw.  Get a high school cheerleading squad.  Maybe play that Mets song.  With pom-poms.  Oh.  The funny thing is, is when we went down there to do it, you know, it was nighttime, and  a lot of the guys were drunk, and they thought we were cops.  As we're going around, we're offering the guys money to talk to us and to, you know, not  kill us.  And we didn't give Lady Di a dime, and all the money they had, as soon as we were done,  they went and bought beer with it.  That's all they spent the money on.  Of course. 
[03:27:30]  What else are they going to do?  But if you're an alcoholic, why beer?  It seems like such a dumb...  You mean, you're saying you're not getting banged for your buck.  Yeah, right.  You want, like, more alcohol.  I agree.  I feel like a bottle of some comfort.  Her next step is either jail or death or an issue.  You know, she's...  Yeah, you think that's...  Oh, yeah.  I mean, where's she going?  Jail's got to be around the corner.  I hope she gets clean.  The face doesn't look healthy.  There's some stuff going on on that face, man.  Yeah.  Let's go to the West Coast and say hi to John in Los Angeles.  John.  Morning, boys. 
[03:28:00]  Morning, John.  Thanks for calling the program.  This is kind of a story for Jimmy and for Anthony, because I relate to you both.  We went to a baseball game on Sunday, got stuck behind sitting some kids, a bunch of kids  with their family that were a complete pain in the ass for six innings until they put a  pinch hitter named Ramon into the game.  And my friend Josh and I got triggered, and we sat and screamed, Ramon, every batter that  got up until the family got up and left a half an hour later. 
[03:28:30]  Very good.  You're a problem solver.  Were the kids being annoying during the game?  Absolutely.  Here's how you handle this when there's kids at the game.  No, no.  I want you to say this, sir.  You're the caller.  I want you to say, Mama, I want a hot dog.  Mama, I want a hot dog.  I like that he did it.  It's the solution for that last problem with the child.  What?  You're saying you have a problem with kids at a baseball game or something?  Yes.  Shut up. 
[03:29:00]  You guys are fucking insane.  Absolutely.  Tell them to shut up.  I'm trying to enjoy the game.  Exactly.  Yes, exactly.  We interrupt this program to bring you the Ozone Midget Sighting of the Day.  Who saw this coming?  Cool.  John, what's up?  I saw a midget.  I saw a midget.  All right.  And?  And it was, you know, I thought that seeing a midget would be the coolest thing ever,  but this one had no arm, so it was even better.  You saw an armless midget?  Yes.  It's a midget.  It's a midget.  It's a midget at Shea Stadium. 
[03:29:30]  He was also gay.  Yeah.  I got nothing.  I'm sorry.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  Can I say something?  Rich and I saw a tall midget today.  Oh, yeah.  Come in here.  You ever see a tall midget?  I've seen tall midgets.  I think he was, like, above five feet.  Hey, get that thing in here.  With the arms.  Get that thing.  Yeah, we got a tall midget.  He was a tall midget.  This is somebody that, at the last minute, when all the DNA and all the genes were coagulating,  doing whatever they do, he was supposed to be a midget. 
[03:30:00]  No, his head got stuck.  He's like that.  Yeah.  He's got short arms.  He's ill-proportioned.  And you know what?  There's a lot of midgets in Northeast Philly next weekend at the Comedy Cabaret.  Oh, Ryan.  Very nice.  See, look at his arms.  They come right up to his belt line.  He only shuffles them around, trying to move them so they look busy.  He can't even put them in his pocket.  Nope.  A little longer.  Why are you talking about me?  I'm your husband.  You just spit food out of your mouth.  I did not.  Hey, let's go to Pat in Boston. 
[03:30:30]  Pat, what did you learn on the show today?  Duke's theme song is Suck it or lose a tooth, bitch.  Let's go to Doug in Arkansas.  Doug, what did you learn today?  Today on the show, I learned that violin is Satan's prib tonight.  Eatabullet.com.  Thank you, mister.  All right, let's go to Arizona.  Jason, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned two things.  Little Jimmy taught me that a rectal witch is more entertaining than a Christian comedian.  And Ann taught me that black people are the best sucker punchers.  There you go.  You learned stuff on the show.  Best sucker punchers. 
[03:31:00]  Kenny, what did you learn?  Today I learned that it's not considered cannibalism if it's deep fried.  Yeah, very nice.  We got 10 seconds.  Once again, boss, where are you going to be?  Caroline's, Thursday and Sunday.  It's Thursday and Sunday, Caroline.  Caroline's here in New York City.  Smooth, bitch.  Thursday night and Sunday night.  And I won't be at Caroline's.  I'll be, um...  This party is over.  Everybody go home.  Speak the Beat in the show. </pre>
