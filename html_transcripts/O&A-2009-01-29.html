<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a listener email from Danny detailing his frustrating experience at a closing Circuit City, where he was sold the wrong hard drive and was unable to return it.  This led to a discussion of increasingly elaborate revenge fantasies against the Circuit City employees.

The conversation then shifted to the death of Lynyrd Skynyrd keyboardist Billy Powell, prompting a discussion about bands continuing after the death of original members.  This transitioned into a strongly critical and often offensive discussion of President Obama's foreign policy, specifically his approach to Iran and Guantanamo Bay.  Caller Freddie engaged in a heated debate with the hosts about Obama's and Bush's roles in Middle Eastern conflicts. The segment ended with a failed attempt to summarize the plot of *Lost* in 60 seconds.

The show then focused on Rush Limbaugh's perceived political opportunism, suggesting his success was tied to Obama's presidency, using offensive nicknames for the president. This was followed by a discussion of the Hotel Carter, deemed the "dirtiest hotel in America," featuring a caller, Rich, describing his horrific experience and a news report detailing a corpse found in a room.  Trucker Skip called in briefly. The hosts also dissected a poorly executed news report from New York One, repeatedly replaying and mocking a reporter's botched *Coming to America* reference.  A satirical skit about Obama shutting down *American Idol* was played, followed by a trivia segment about the Baseball Hall of Fame, which devolved into a humorous discussion about Ty Cobb's violent and racist behavior, with further anecdotes from a listener.  The show also touched upon the stimulus package and included personal anecdotes from Opie and Jimmy, including Jimmy's bizarre story about a deceased woman.  A call to action to get Anthony on Hannity's show was made.

The next segment began with a discussion of the physical contact involved in childhood square dancing. This segued into a discussion of the stimulus package, with promises of humorous segments related to STDs.  The conversation returned to Ty Cobb's violent and racist behavior, comparing his Hall of Fame status to Pete Rose's exclusion.  A clip of Opie discussing the cryogenic freezing of Ted Williams' head was played, leading to a tangent about alleged spousal abuse by baseball players.  The show briefly mentioned Hannity's show before returning to the stimulus package, with Anthony expressing skepticism about various allocations, including funding for STDs, global warming, and the auto industry.  Caller Todd debated Anthony about Obama's policies and the definition of socialism, referencing Rush Limbaugh's comments about hoping Obama fails.  A music marathon followed, preceded by further discussion of Billy Powell's death and Opie's desire to play Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Give Me Back My Bullets."  The show returned to the stimulus package, focusing on funding for government vehicles and Amtrak.  A discussion of Oprah Winfrey's birthday and the start date of her show ensued.  The show concluded with a discussion of *Life on Mars*, *Back to the Future*, and several anecdotes about Marty McFly.  Jimmy revealed he had a Stephen King autograph and shared a joke involving Marty McFly. An anecdote about an intern abusing his authority concluded this segment.

The final segment centered around the hosts' antics with their new intern, Paul, who was given the title "Executive Intern/XM Office Manager," leading to humorous anecdotes about his behavior.  The hosts played old audio clips, including bastardized versions of their names, a promotion for their Real Rock TV show (with discussions of covering up nudity), and bits featuring Anthony's brother Joe (who was in studio), including a Frank Sinatra parody.  Other clips included a listener-gifted vibrator and an old segment featuring Beth Hart, leading to a discussion of their past ban from WABU.  Throughout the segment, there was frequent use of offensive language and discussions of sexually suggestive topics.  The hosts also referenced various past segments and their broadcasting history.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Fud, fud, fud.  Ah, good morning.  Hi!  Wait, let me take a sip.  Ah!  Coffee.  A cup of joe.  I love coffee.  We've got the phone number, 877-212-ON-A. 
[00:00:30]  Yes, phone us.  We've got the website for all the visual stuff we talk about, onaradio.com.  I don't even know where to begin today. There's so much going on.  I know Danny sent out an email last night, so maybe we should start with Danny.  And it was a huge, like a mystery. It was a cliffhanger email.  It sure was, Danny.  He sent out a cliffhanger email.  I'm not a fan of the cliffhanger email.  Know who does that a lot?  Who?  E-Rock. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, but who cares? Because you know it's just going to be some stupid...  I'm not a fan of the, uh, the T's.  Oh, really?  Well, I mean, as far as, like, work stuff...  Let me explain.  When you do a radio show, you've got T's stuff.  It's just part of, you know, trying to get people to listen a little longer.  You understand that.  You get frustrated, but I've honed that craft.  Certainly.  But when it comes to emails, E-Rock writes me, he goes,  Uh, when you get a chance, could you, uh, call me? 
[00:01:30]  I got a question about the channel.  Why not just text?  Thank you!  Just text the guy.  And he does it all the time.  So I have to write back, what, what is this about?  Because you know what?  In this day and age, you don't have to make all those dumb phone calls anymore.  No.  We all have a phone that has some nice capabilities,  and you can get a lot done without having to talk to a human being.  I am all about texting.  Leave me alone.  Don't call me.  Texting, emailing.  When my phone rings like it's a phone call, I just get annoyed. 
[00:02:00]  That's weird, right?  I'm like, what is this?  Stop it.  Why would you want to actually talk?  Just text.  Well, we could just use our phones to communicate.  Yay!  So E-Rock writes, yeah, when you get a chance, give me a call.  I got a question about the channel.  I'm like, why would I ever call you?  So I have to write back, what is this about?  And then he goes, well, just call me when you get a chance.  I'm like, no.  Yeah.  No, we probably could solve it this way.  But with that being said, Danny sort of had one of those emails last night. 
[00:02:30]  And I don't usually do that either, but it was so much to type.  Like, I just felt like I couldn't just sit there and write it.  Because who's going to read a huge page long email, you know?  Well, we did get the gist of it.  It's like, I want to kill somebody.  I was at Circuit City.  So I'm like, okay.  I wasn't even home yet.  Like, I was basically standing outside of the store just going, okay.  But I think everyone could understand the difference between the two emails, the E-Rock email.  And yours at least made it go, wow, I can't wait to ask Danny tomorrow on the show 
[00:03:00]  what this is all about.  We're going to hear this cold, right?  You didn't tell anybody?  The only person who knows anything is Travis.  I was talking to him last night.  Yeah.  I had to tell somebody.  I know Circuit City is doing their liquidation thing, which, by the way, is a nightmare.  It is.  It really, really is.  And, like, the sales aren't even that great in the first place.  No, they're going to get great.  Well, now.  That's the problem.  Because everyone, when they hear Circuit City's closing, they're liquidating everything.  Everyone runs to the Circuit City's thinking they're going to get amazing deals.  But what they do, because they're kind of smart, they knock it down. 
[00:03:30]  They knock it down, 10%.  And as the weeks go on, all of a sudden it'll be 70% off.  But it'll be for, like, old Atari systems and old phones and stuff like that.  At that point, it's garbage.  There's garbage on the floor.  Right.  Like, they don't even care.  It's like you're walking into a looted store.  I thought it was this set of Slumdog Millionaire.  I went in there and, yeah.  All right.  So what happened, Dan?  Well, my hard drive had crashed yesterday.  Which, by the way, is amazing.  I don't mean to keep jumping in here, but you're the third person this week alone that 
[00:04:00]  had a hard drive crash.  I don't know.  I know three people in one week.  And a car crash.  And a car crash.  And a car crash, right.  Something else has to happen.  Yeah.  No.  No.  No.  But, so I figured, all right, well, I know Circuit City's, you know, liquidating, so I  could probably get some kind of discount.  So I'll just drive over to Circuit City.  It's five minutes from my house.  And, you know, I'll get a hard drive and, you know, problem solved.  So I go down there.  I bring my old hard drive with me because I, you know, just want to make sure I'm getting  the right thing and everything.  Sure. 
[00:04:30]  So I walk up to some fat sales girl and I say, hey, you know, and I have the one that  I picked out from the shelf.  And I'm like, I just want to make sure this is the right thing because I know you guys  are liquidating.  There's no returns, blah, blah, blah.  So I just want to make sure I have the right thing.  Right there is a problem.  Before I get out of here.  What are you doing?  You just set up your own problem.  Unless you're walking in paying for it, you've got to be like Jerry Seinfeld was with the  Soup Nazi as far as Circuit City goes now.  Walk up, hand the money, get your product and leave. 
[00:05:00]  One notebook hard drive, please.  Please.  And then step away.  Step to the side.  Just keep stepping to the side.  Give them the money and walk out.  Any questions, anything else, you're asking for trouble.  I think you're right.  No electronics for you.  I think you're right.  All right.  So you asked.  So, you know, I asked.  And so she could see my old hard drive.  She sees the box that I have in my hand.  And she goes, oh, yeah, that'll work.  That's fine.  I'm like, sure?  Yeah.  Okay.  I go.  I walk.  I pay for my stuff.  I go home.  I'm all happy.  I'm like, all right, I'll get to install new OS. 
[00:05:30]  This is going to be fun.  So I get home.  And, you know, it doesn't take much to see that it's obviously the wrong hard drive.  The connection is completely different.  And now I know.  I'm like, well, great, because it's stamped right on my receipt.  Like, no returns, no exchanges or whatever.  And I'm like, well, and I'm like, you know what?  It was at least the sales girl's fault.  So at least I have some kind of leg to stand on here, right?  Oh, certainly do.  Yeah.  Well, that's when I decide I'm going to call the store.  Oh.  Oh.  To see what, you know, is going on.  So I get a lovely animal on the phone that works for their customer service. 
[00:06:00]  What kind of animal?  Cheetah, panda, wolf.  Well.  A toto.  Why don't you just ring that bell?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I call, and I'm trying to explain the story, and, you know, I'm being nice, and I'm having  a lot of patience with said customer service representative, and she keeps interrupting  and saying, well, I'm sorry, sir, but, you know, there's no refunds, no exchanges, you  know, because you've got to take it up with the liquidator, I guess. 
[00:06:30]  And I'm trying to explain her.  The liquidator?  And I'm telling her, I'm like, it's not that I came in and bought the wrong thing, I was  like, your salesperson sold me the wrong thing, so it's really not my fault, so, I mean,  I guess you guys could probably make an exception, and she just goes, why you got to be all mad  rude to me?  You were being mad rude?  I assume so, and I asked her, I said, I didn't realize I was being mad rude to you.  Mad rude.  And she goes, yeah, well, you were being mad rude to me, and I'm just like, do you think 
[00:07:00]  that this is, and now I'm like, Joe Consumer, I'm going, do you think this is any way to  treat a customer?  You should have went, there's a ripe upstairs.  Yeah.  Oh, you should have went, there's a ripe right there, because that's what they did to you.  Yeah, exactly.  Very badly, too.  So I say, I'm like, don't you at all care about the store that you work for?  She goes, there is no store, they all closing.  Oh, God.  That's exactly it, and that's the attitude you're going to get.  And I'm like, all right, well, obviously I'm not going to get anywhere with this.  That's like standing on the bow of the Titanic and going, I'd like to speak 
[00:07:30]  to the cruise director, please.  I didn't get the buffet.  The buffet's not set up.  Right.  So now I know that this is now a losing battle, so I have some fun anyway, and I decide to  ask, you know, said customer service rep what they plan on doing in three weeks when they're  out of a job.  Oh, good.  Now you want to be mad rude.  Now you're going to be mad rude back.  She goes, I have my job for at least six weeks.  Oh, God damn.  I'm like, wow, sweet.  And then I'm like, yeah, and then what?  And then she goes, I'll go on unemployment. 
[00:08:00]  And I'm like, all right, well, this battle's lost.  So I hang up and I call back, and I think I get the same person, but I guess it's someone  else.  Yeah, it's very hard to tell.  So they pick up and, you know, start to say whatever, and I'm like, yeah, what's your  name?  And she goes, who do you think you are?  He's asking me, what's your name?  And it's a completely different person.  Wow.  And I'm like, and I just say, without explaining my situation, I'm just like, you're going to make  me come down there, aren't you?  You can do whatever you want.  I'm like, all right, fine.  Take the hard drive, take my old one, go back to the store. 
[00:08:30]  I bypass their little service desk and just go straight to the chubby sales girl who told  you the wrong thing.  Good call.  Very good call.  Completely reset.  Mr. Nice, hey, I was just in here, you know, 15 to 20 minutes ago.  Remember?  I was like, you sold me this hard drive, and it's actually the wrong one.  And so I'm just, you know, I'm just looking to exchange it for the right one.  Well, we can't do that because there's no refunds, no exchanges.  And I'm like, yeah, yeah, I get that, but you sold me the wrong one, so it's kind of  different.  It's not like I came in here and, you know, bought something. 
[00:09:00]  You actually sold me the wrong thing.  Oh, my God.  Well, I don't know.  You have to talk to a manager or something.  And I'm like, you can't be serious.  Like, you sold me the wrong thing.  So I speak to, like, the manager in that department.  He's like, well, he's like, yeah, there's nothing really we can do about it, so you'll  have to talk to, like, you know, the manager of the whole store or whatever.  And I just had to say to the guy, I'm like, can you just please acknowledge that your  salesperson just sold me the wrong thing?  And it's not like it was a $25 thing.  I wouldn't care.  But it was, you know, $100 plus tax, blah, blah, blah.  It's, you know, money. 
[00:09:30]  So now they call the manager.  They acknowledge it again.  He was just like, well, I understand, but, you know, there's nothing we can do.  He was trying to be kind of sort of nice about the whole thing.  How about here's what they do.  They box up the one.  They take it back and just give you the right one.  Right.  No one's going to care in a few weeks.  No one gives a crap.  The store is done.  It's gone.  Why would they give you that much trouble and just not just give you the give you give  you five hard drives? 
[00:10:00]  I couldn't believe it.  I just I couldn't believe that, like, this is becoming such of a big deal.  Like, it was so not an issue.  And especially not mine.  You know, like, I'm getting angry.  I'm so irritated for him already.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I know how to say it.  It gets so much better.  Because now I ask to speak to the manager.  And so I see a nice gentleman.  Okay.  Who's salt and peppery.  And he's, you know, he looks like he's the kind of guy that would be able to get something  done for you.  Certainly.  Should you be so inclined. 
[00:10:30]  And so, and he, you know, this is after some waiting, so I'm getting a little fidgety.  But here he is.  And I say, okay, well, here's the problem.  I was like, your salesperson in, you know, the computers section, she sold me the wrong  hard drive.  I was like, I brought my old one with me so that, you know, I would kind of ensure that  I got the right one.  Yes.  And I brought it home and it was the wrong one.  And I was like, I know that you guys have a no refund because you're liquidating everything.  But, you know, obviously it's not my mistake.  So I was just wondering if you could exchange it for me.  He's like, well, now we can't do that because no refunds, no exchange.  I'm like, yeah, I get that. 
[00:11:00]  But you, your salesperson sold me the wrong thing.  I was just like, well, I don't understand how you cannot exchange this for me.  Like, it's very easy to do.  He's like, well, we can't do it.  And he's just giving me a really hard time, just as hard as the time as everyone else  who I've spoken to.  And I couldn't believe that this was the kind of, you know, treatment I was getting from  like the manager.  That's what you get.  And I said, well, I was like, well, how come you have a sales girl in computers who doesn't  know what she's talking about selling people the wrong thing?  And he goes, oh, yeah, well, I guess I'll have to have a talk with her.  Oh, that's good.  That'll work.  Everybody's losing their jobs, you know, three weeks every week. 
[00:11:30]  Getting reprimanded.  What is a talker to do?  If it's any consolation, at least those people are all going to suffer.  Well, I hope so.  They're all going down the toilet.  I hope so, yeah.  Nice.  So I'm just holding the hard drive now.  And I'm like, well, what do you expect me to do with this?  Oh, please tell me.  You smashed it somewhere.  And he goes, sir, I can't tell you what to do with your own property.  Uh, yeah, well, how about I swing it into the wall, into a monitor?  I go, I go, dude, I was like, dude, it's like over $100 that I just threw away. 
[00:12:00]  And he goes, well, I wouldn't throw it away.  What are you supposed to do with it?  Yeah, so now I'm getting annoyed because he's just being an ass.  Yeah, now he's being condescending.  He goes, he's like, maybe you should try eBay.  And I'm like, why do I need to go out of my way?  You just bought it.  I just bought it 15 minutes ago.  Do the right thing.  So now you want me to sell it at a loss because your salesperson sold me the wrong thing.  They're just told to say, yeah, that'll work.  I was like, yeah, that'll work.  And I didn't even let him respond. 
[00:12:30]  I was like, and you're just going to let an inexperienced salesperson who does not know  what she's talking about sell the wrong thing to people.  And I was like, and you're just going to let that happen.  He goes, no, you're right.  I'll fire her.  Oh, boy, condescending.  So now I'm completely losing my mind.  This son of a bitch, they probably have been told if someone comes up with a question,  just tell them, yes, it'll work.  Just so they can get rid of their crap.  Just so they can sell their crap.  So they just say, will this work?  And they go, oh, yeah, this will work. 
[00:13:00]  And then they sell it.  That's exactly what they're doing.  That's what I'm thinking.  But here's the best part of the whole thing, right?  So now.  You went in and there was blood on the walls.  Well, no, because that would be the best part.  So now I know that I'm just screwed and I kind of have to accept it.  I'm like, all right, now I just have to walk out of here.  Eat it.  Suck on it.  So I just go to him.  And again, I'm like Hank Hill.  I go, you know, it's no wonder that this place is going out of business when you treat your customers  this way, right?  And so now he and the customer service reps, who I know I spoke to on the phone, you know,  they go like this, swear, swear, hey, hey, and they start clapping at me after I said that. 
[00:13:30]  And I'm just like stunned now.  I'm just like, what the hell was that?  Just bank that that, you know what you could bank on?  That is their utter frustration and pain that they are so effed and will be joining the ranks  of the un-effing ployed.  I couldn't believe it.  And I'm like, what store was this?  Circuit City.  No, where?  College Point, 20th Avenue.  Okay.  Manager's name is Russ. 
[00:14:00]  I'd love to go there.  Where is that?  Is that Brooklyn, Queens?  That's Queens.  I would love to go there.  So I'm like stunned.  I'm like, what was that?  And he goes, you know, the only customers, he's like, the only customers that complain  are the ones that don't get their way.  And I was like, that's the most asinine thing I've ever heard in my life.  Yeah, yeah, the ones that get their way and complain?  I was like, why would I complain if I get my way?  So now I know, obviously, now that this is a losing battle.  And I'm just, you know, I'm just like, well, you know what, everybody?  Have fun at your next exciting job in retail electronics sales. 
[00:14:30]  And walked out, just stunned.  And that's pretty much where that email came into play.  You used a credit card.  And I used my debit card, so I can't even put a stop on the charge.  They won't even, dude, I wanted to pay for it with my Circuit City card.  But guess who's not accepting those anymore?  Oh, really?  Circuit City wouldn't accept that.  Even though it's completely, like that whole service is run by Chase, and I think service  by Chase, but it's not Chase going out of business, so I don't know why I can't use  it.  But they're not accepting that.  There you go. 
[00:15:00]  So now I'm stuck with a 250 gig hard drive I can't use.  So if there's anyone out there that needs one, let me know.  Hey, I'll pay you 10 bucks for it.  I'll give you 20.  As he's saying that, I'm thinking, I hope you swing that into the manager's mouth.  I would have had to do something.  I would have probably, I probably would have opened up the box and smashed it right in  front of that place.  Yeah, I'd have to just, like, I understand, but in my position, I would be able to absorb  the loss a little easier, thank God for, you know, my life. 
[00:15:30]  Not about that, though.  But just to take it and smash it.  That's what I would have to do.  And I would honestly throw it into a monitor.  Really?  And then just wait for the cops.  And then explain, like, I don't know, hey, and then I would say, like, yeah, these guys,  and I explain the whole thing and go, ah, I was tossing it to a guy, it's off camera,  watch the security cameras, I was throwing it to him.  I was sitting, I'm standing there, as it's always going down, and I knew it was going 
[00:16:00]  to go bad, because when I was waiting for the manager, the customer service persons,  that I had a feeling I had spoken to on the phone earlier, they kind of, like, were  looking at me like, oh, I just saw this guy, he's holding hard drive, someone just called  about it, this has to be that guy.  So they were kind of, like, eyeing me and, like, whispering and stuff.  So they were just waiting.  They could not wait to get on me about this.  Oh, here's what you do.  Sorry.  Throw it through the monitor, pay for the monitor with the Amex, call up Amex, cancel it.  And you know damn well they can't go, there's too much crap going on. 
[00:16:30]  They're not going to be able to fight the fact that there's this charge, those investigations  go on for a while, and then you ate one of their monitors, you go, there, now eat it.  But just call the cop, so he'd run up and go.  But I paid for it.  So you know what?  No, I paid for the monitor.  Take that step out of the equation, just buy a lot of stuff with your credit card, cancel  it as soon as you get home.  You could smash it, though.  I'd pick up a monitor.  I'm just saying, get some good stuff.  I'd pick up a monitor and go, oops, and just smash it on the floor and go, I'm sorry, let 
[00:17:00]  me pay with that with my Amex.  And then I'd pay and go, and then in the store I'd call and go, hello?  Hello?  Yeah, I want to cancel a charge for a monitor I just bought from Circuit City.  Right.  They dropped it.  Yeah, they dropped it.  And they're trying to say I did, and that's just crazy.  There are things we can do.  Let's do this.  No, because they don't care.  They don't care.  They're all going to be out of jobs.  Nobody cares.  But it's so funny.  It would be funny for me to know I just screwed them, that one of their idiots have to come  out and clean it up. 
[00:17:30]  Now clean it up!  Danny was in a bad spot.  You were in a no-win situation.  Because in the end, he's right.  No one gives a crap in that situation.  They all know they're losing their jobs.  I just couldn't...  Can we have, Danny, how about, like Ann said, you buy the right one with your credit card  now in a different store.  And then just...  Cancel the payment.  Cancel the payment.  Now you've paid the right amount of money.  You can.  Cancel the debit card.  It's like pretty important.  If he used his credit card, that would be an easy move.  You got a credit card?  Regular one?  No.  I used to have some troubles back in the day.  Wow.  You know, waiting on credit problems. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  You know.  No, I purposely don't have credit cards anymore, so I don't get myself in those same troubles.  Yeah.  Well, you hit a nerve with the people out there.  The phones are lit, so...  I'm disgusted and want vengeance.  Dude, I knew...  I was like, if...  I know the cops will be called if I did anything.  Yeah.  But, like, I wanted nothing more.  It depends what you do.  I wanted nothing more.  You got to know what you can do and what you can't.  I just wanted to run...  A little slam dunk on the floor.  They're going to look for you, but you know what?  In the end, you'll be all right.  Circuit City, so Danny, clear, giraffes.  I wanted to run full steam into the manager, into his chest with my shoulder. 
[00:18:30]  Like, that would have been worth it.  Oh, yeah.  And, like, I would have got arrested just watching him, like the grape lady, trying to struggle  for breath.  No, you do, yeah.  It would have been worth it.  You put on a football helmet and just start running full speed into the huge TVs, one  after another.  Oh, God, Dan.  Until they call the cops.  Hey, liquidated asses.  I was telling another friend of mine about the store.  He's like, you know what you do?  I'm like, what?  He goes, take your car, right?  He's like, leave it running right outside the store. 
[00:19:00]  He's like, walk in like you're just browsing.  Take the right one and just run out the store.  It's like a bank robbery.  They got cameras everywhere.  That's the problem.  That's why you got to do it legitimately.  Which would be, drop something hugely expensive.  Yeah.  Break it.  Yeah.  Pay for it with the Amex.  And then call up right in front of them.  And then all loud, like the loud guy bit.  Hello!  Is this American Express?  I'd like to cancel a charge. 
[00:19:30]  I just...  Dan could do some of that robbing.  Because you look like a lot of different people.  You're lucky that way.  Someone like me, I'm screwed.  I thought about it.  I was like, I could go home.  Yeah, you saved your beard and stuff.  I put my hair up, I could shave, I could wear a different jacket.  You'd be the guy that got your debit card.  It's like, no, we know this is the guy.  What is this guy, stupid?  But I urge anyone who's looking to get a deal, screw Circus City, don't go there.  You know what?  Don't go there.  Those liquidation things never work out in the end.  No one cares.  They look like a great thing, but it's always a nightmare. 
[00:20:00]  Let's take our first break.  Like, 877-212-018, every phone is lit.  And a lot of people are having the same problems.  Well, they were a terrible store where they were doing well.  Yeah, it's true.  They always said, you know what?  They did, but I always went simply because I never really needed their salespeople.  I knew what I was going in there for, whether it was a game or something like a DVD or something like that.  I never needed them.  And this is like the first time I really ever needed them.  It took me 20 minutes to ask one person a question once in an empty store. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, well, that's why they're out of business.  We've got to take a break.  Maybe we do a little Liquid A bombing over there.  Oh, for liquidation.  Liquid A-tion.  Yeah, liquid A-tion.  They don't know where that's coming from.  Liquid A-tion.  Oh, God.  Maybe we get a few people to just kind of walk around the store.  Oh, I'm liking that idea.  There's things we can do, Danny.  I can't.  I mean, I can never do anything.  Oh, this is just for the radio. 
[00:21:00]  That would be real funny.  Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Why is there one?  You guys got some?  Or are you just standing around?  No.  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Sad news.  We lost another Skinner.  I think they're down one original member, Leonard Skinner.  One original member.  That's it, man.  One.  Keyboardist, Billy Powell.  Is dead at the age of 56. 
[00:21:30]  He looked a lot older than that.  He certainly did.  He had the frizzy, fro-y hair.  A bit on the chubby side.  Dressed very colorfully.  They almost got a...  Gayly.  Huh?  Let's say he dressed gayly.  Well, I was trying to be polite, but yes, Anthony.  I was just using it as a happy term.  He dressed like he should be on Broadway.  Anyway, so one to go, and you got a full band in heaven. 
[00:22:00]  Who's the last guy left?  Last guy standing?  That's the trivia question today for the Skinner fans out there.  Let's see.  Actually, the Skinner fans, we know that.  Rossington or Collins?  I think we lost one of them.  At least one of them, right?  And they went to Rossington-Collins.  And it's just...  Is it Rossington?  Yeah.  He's the last one?  Apparently Gary Rossington.  I was only kidding.  That's the only two, like, I know their names that weren't dead.  Oh, look at you. 
[00:22:30]  And we talk about this from time to time.  These bands will go on.  I mean, way past all the original members being dead.  Oh, yeah.  Leonard Skinner will be around forever.  I know they do it with the doo-wop bands and stuff where you...  Like, some of your older relatives, oh, I'm going to go see...  Can't even come up with one right now.  Yeah.  And then you do a little research and you find out that all the original members are long gone,  but the name continues.  But it's going to start happening with the rock bands we grew up with is what I'm getting at here.  Skinner, one to go.  They're going to continue? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, you think they're not going to continue when the last of the original members are gone?  And then it's a whole new band called Leonard Skinner.  Right.  Weird.  Really weird.  Those brothers still singing, right?  Is that the...  Huh?  What's his name?  Who's that?  Oh, yeah, his younger brother is...  He does a great job, actually.  He sounds so much like his old brother, it's ridiculous.  And then it's good to see down there in Washington that the Democrats and the Republicans are working together  just like President Obama wanted. 
[00:23:30]  Now, one Republican voted for the stimulus package?  Well, because it's not really a stimulus package, but whatever.  That's why the Republicans didn't want to go along with him.  Right.  This is a little much.  I'm just disgusted with it, but...  Why are you disgusted?  Why?  Why?  He's everyone's president.  We have to stand behind him and blah, blah, blah.  Because I don't think an emergency...  We're in a goddamn financial emergency right now, according to Barry... 
[00:24:00]  What'd you say?  Barry Hussain.  What?  I'm calling him Barry Hussain.  What?  I'm calling him Barry Hussain.  It's his name.  It's his name.  If people called George Bush...  They didn't call him President George Bush.  A lot of people said, oh, George W.  George W, right.  They didn't call him President Bush with the respect that the office calls for.  Forget about what a job he did, a lousy job, whatever.  But he's Barry Hussain to me, and he's earning that name every ding-dong day by first giving 
[00:24:30]  his first presidential interview to an Arab station.  And now, pretty much just lapping, lapping the hindquarters of the Iranians.  The dinner jacket guy?  Ahmadinejad.  Yeah.  Ahmadinejad.  That's it.  We'll fire up a letter to him.  And Ahmadinejad just stands there on a daily basis and talks about just killing the Zionist 
[00:25:00]  pigs and the, you know, the Holocaust never happened and whatever, pro-anti-Israel.  I'm not even talking about that.  And just, he's not a nice guy.  They don't like our lifestyle.  They don't like who we are as a people and the way we run our lives.  It has nothing to do with Bush did this or, you know, treat him better and they'll treat  us better. 
[00:25:30]  It's not the mentality you're dealing with.  It's like sitting down with a tiger.  You can't sit down with a tiger and, you know, you got a guy that's a lion tamer or  whatever, tiger tamer, and he's got the right equipment, the chair and the whip, and he gets  him into shape.  I never thought that was the right equipment, by the way.  No.  You should have a gun and a big friggin' trident.  I always thought that guy was a lunatic in the circus.  Oh, yeah, that'll help you.  A stupid chair with four legs and a whip.  A chair and a whip.  Great.  You're doing a chair. 
[00:26:00]  Those are weapons of desperation.  Do you think he thought that up or it just happened one day?  He's like, I got nothing but a chair.  Yeah.  If all of a sudden that door opened and a tiger came in, what would you do?  You'd pick up your chair and something that you could sling at it.  You're right.  My weapon would be sunglasses and a grapefruit.  Right.  And in the center ring with sunglasses and a grapefruit.  Yeah.  I have a hot cup of coffee I could throw in the eyes of the tiger.  That should stop him for a half a second.  See a nice little appetizer for him before he bites you.  But you're right.  If you're going to be prepared, you don't go with the stool and the whip. 
[00:26:30]  Go in there prepared.  But it's like you're dealing with a tiger and you think that having nice conversation  with him is going to give you a dialogue with him.  These people, they're way of life.  You don't give him an A for effort for at least trying.  No.  I give him an F for putting us in very bad.  His foreign policy so far, or lack thereof, or ass-kissing policy.  Well, it's only been four days.  Well, Guantanamo.  These two, you know, hey, let's shut that down before we figure out what we're doing with 
[00:27:00]  anyone there.  And by the way, a few of the people that have gotten out of Guantanamo, right back to Al-Qaeda.  Yeah.  We don't even know how many.  Well, you go back to what you know.  Go back to what you know?  Yeah.  Is that what you're saying?  What do you want these guys to do?  What I want this idiot to do.  Going on a European vacation?  I mean, of course they're going back there.  It will be so sad to have to say I told you so to this idiot, because it'll only mean...  To who?  To Obama.  You think you're going to get FaceTime? 
[00:27:30]  Barry, Barry.  You're going to have FaceTime with him, you think?  I mean, figuratively.  Oh, okay.  On the air.  Oh.  To say I told you so, because it'll only mean that there was a huge loss of innocent  He's not listening to us, though.  He's too busy listening to Rush.  Well...  Rush Limbaugh.  You know, it'll just be a huge loss of innocent lives, and that will be the I told you so.  Because he apparently doesn't understand.  You can't go from the Bush policy and transition to this happy-go-lucky, let-me-write-this-guy-a-little-letter policy. 
[00:28:00]  Well, he said, like, I want Islam to unclench their fists and accept our hand, which is nice in theory.  But then Ahmadinejad is like, well, I want a U.S. apology.  Oh, yeah.  He wants an apology.  He'll probably get it.  You can't go to guys like that, like, hey, we know that we're so wrong and we're so sorry.  It's this groveling...  You have to be willing to talk.  I agree with that.  But you have to go there in a position of, look, if you want to talk to us, we'll talk to you.  Go ahead.  Go.  Talk. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  You can't go there with your hat in your hand and go, hey, look, we understand that it's all these awful policies of the West that cause Islamic radical...  It's just, uh...  It's weak.  Yep.  It's Jimmy Carter-ish.  I agree.  And it's just going to undermine the security of this country.  Maybe he's doing a little rope-a-dope, my friends.  Well, he's got the second half.  Maybe he's doing a little rope-a-dope.  Yeah.  The dope.  Maybe he's doing a little rope-a-dope, and now, you know, the big fist right to the face.  He's not a rope-a-dope guy.  He's a wimpy Democrat liberal ass. 
[00:29:00]  What is it?  What?  What?  Barry Hussein.  Barry Hussein and his goddamn asinine foreign policy and his asinine stimulus package that includes chlamydia cures for the low income.  Is that what's going on with the stimulus package?  What are some of the things that is in the stimulus package?  Over $300 million is going towards diseases, a sexually transmitted disease education. 
[00:29:30]  All right.  Fine.  Not in a stimulus package, you dummy.  So, yeah, you think people, do you think that the Democrats got, like, a bunch of people got together and said, well, this is kind of what I want to get through.  How can I tie this in and sell it as stimulus?  Yeah.  Like, people would just, well, it's stimulus because if they're not getting VD, we won't have to give them money.  So that stimulates the economy.  It's, yeah.  I could see them actually trying to hash that through and debate it as being stimulus. 
[00:30:00]  Stimulus package is let's get people jobs.  Let's get the economy going.  Let's get people back into investing in the country.  That doesn't do it when you're just, you know, giving money to these programs.  I want to hear what some of these programs really are.  Well, another one he said.  They don't have a chlamydia.  I call it that.  The chlamydia clause.  I mean, it's funny and all, but I want to know.  Page 127 of this frigging stimulus package or something.  Well, that's what Washington does.  Oh, well, you know something?  What about transparency? 
[00:30:30]  What about his big transparency that he's not going to pork barrel these bills?  And for something like this economic stimulus package, which is supposed to take care of the country right now, it's an urgent thing to add that crap in.  It's pure democratic bull.  Bull.  I like, but you like pork.  I like pork.  I love some pork.  Is pork good in this situation?  The other white meat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The sound of that.  Oh, yeah.  I don't like ears, though.  Ear marks. 
[00:31:00]  No, the ear marks.  You ever try an ear?  They're tough.  Pork ears.  You can't really chew through it.  I like pork rinds.  No, I hate those things.  Oh, good.  I got your com.  This is good.  No.  Yeah, I got your com.  I'm annoyed at Barry Hussein.  Don't make me push that button.  Barry Hussein.  No.  No, I'm not going to om.  I'm not om-ing.  I'm annoyed.  I'm annoyed at what this idiot is doing.  You're right, that foreign policy.  Foreign policy is a joke.  Foreign policy. 
[00:31:30]  And then there was another thing in the stimulus package.  Yeah.  Or he just signed another bill, because he loves signing those, to make it easier.  Uh-huh.  It makes it easier for employees to sue their employers for discrimination.  That's what he just signed also.  So, more litigation, more lawyers stepping in.  Like, that hasn't been done enough.  What was standing in the way of people suing their employers for discrimination when every 
[00:32:00]  day you open the paper and see a new case?  What was standing in people's way to sue their employer?  I didn't think they needed another bill signed.  This guy is going right for his constituency.  Oh.  Which isn't the 53% that voted for him.  Barack gonna take dance money?  Yeah.  Well, we'll see that.  Where's my...  I want to play that.  All right.  A little bit of...  The other side fighting back a little bit.  Freddie in Belmore.  Freddie!  I'm Freddie. 
[00:32:30]  Hey, how you guys doing?  Good, Freddie.  Hey, Anthony, man.  Bush got us into this problem.  Whatever this guy, I mean, the judge said at the UN, he was totally right about America.  Bush got us into it, huh?  Not extremist Muslims who blew us up.  That didn't do anything.  Not extremist Muslims who drove their little Zodiac boat into the USS Cole.  That wasn't it.  Not the extremist Muslims that blew up our embassies and our marine barracks.  It was George Bush.  Shut up!  Lib! 
[00:33:00]  Ya effin' lib!  Oh.  Live with it when another goddamn building gets blown up!  Before we went in, how many was there?  Live with it when another...  Another few thousand people get killed because of this idiot's foreign policy.  What did you ask me, Freddie?  Because I'm willing to listen.  Okay.  How many extremist Muslims were there in Iraq when Saddam was in there?  In charge?  I always have said...  None, because he knew how to treat them.  Yes.  You killed them.  I've always said...  Dude, dude, listen to me.  Listen, please listen to me. 
[00:33:30]  I've always said that Saddam Hussein was the best person to run that savage country.  I've always said that.  He ruled with an iron fist.  If someone acted up, he killed them.  That's why they were quiet.  And those extremists just came from other places into Iraq.  That's like...  Right.  Like, oh God, Al-Zakawi, he was from Jordan.  These are guys that existed.  They existed.  They just kind of like a magnet.  They just kind of got sucked into Iraq.  But they were all over the place anyway. 
[00:34:00]  They didn't just get created overnight.  That's what he said when he went to the U.N.  Whatever he said about Bush was...  I'm a pure American, but whatever he said was right.  Yeah.  Did Ahmadinejad address the fact that Iran has been...  Or Syria has been funneling weapons to terrorists to make Iraq worse?  Did he mention that?  Listen, so we're not helping the situation.  No, no, you didn't answer my question.  By the way, you stutter and mutter at you.  You didn't answer my question.  Did he address that? 
[00:34:30]  Did he address the fact that them and Syria have been funneling weapons to make it worse?  Bush said that he was 100% wrong.  If he said that, I would have no problem.  If the fact that says what they did wrong, then there'd be no problem.  Just because Bush was wrong doesn't make Barry right.  He was wrong.  You didn't answer my question.  You're right, Jimmy.  I'm saying, did he address that part of it?  No, but...  Like, did he address the fact...  Did he address the fact that...  Not that Iraq would be good, but that himself and Syria have made matters a lot worse by 
[00:35:00]  purposefully funneling weapons and arms to people who are killing civilians and targeting  soldiers?  His point is maybe because America's over there but then where they shouldn't be either.  So why does he care?  Iran and Iraq hated each other.  Right.  Right.  That's why Saddam Hussein...  The people who gave Saddam all that stuff before, the mustard gas...  Yeah, we did.  Terrible Americans did when we were trying to help them chase the Soviets out of Afghanistan. 
[00:35:30]  That's how we armed bin Laden.  And we got into Afghanistan just talking about Iraq.  We also dropped two nuclear bombs on a country we do a lot of trading with now.  It's called history.  And we...  Yes.  Time goes by.  Things change.  And we gave weapons.  We sold weapons to Saddam because he was fighting an enemy in Iran.  Yes.  Right.  Okay, so we made mistakes.  They made mistakes.  But everything he said was true.  That's my point.  All right.  Well, go to Iran.  Tell them.  All right.  Tell them yourself.  Thank you, Freddie.  We've got to move on to Dan and Brewster.  Terrible argument, by the way. 
[00:36:00]  Horrible.  Horrible.  We gave Saddam the weapons.  That was only because he was fighting Iran.  And they were our enemy after the Ayatollah Khomeini took over.  So they were our enemy.  And then we blew up all of the weapons that we gave him.  So screw him.  And how about this?  How about the fact that we sold 80 of our best warplanes to Iran when the Shah was still  there?  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden he's booted.  And then the radical Islam has 80 of our warplanes.  And thank God somebody sabotaged them.  Or the Ayatollah Khomeini would have had 80 of our warplanes.  Oh, those morons would have just operated them. 
[00:36:30]  They would have put them in catapults and flown them.  They still had to figure out how to fly them.  F-16s flying 10 feet out of a catapult.  That's hilarious.  Dan and Brewster, how are you, buddy?  Hey, I got a question for you.  Yeah.  You know, Obama attacked us and attacked us with the coal and the towers.  So I don't understand.  You know, we knew there was no weapons to mass destruction.  Yeah.  We got democracy back.  Yeah, right.  How come we don't shift all the troops in Iraq, go to the Pakistan border, find the 
[00:37:00]  guy, and then we can finish your job in our own place?  I agree.  Now, can the people that call me an idiot and everything listen to me when I say this?  I agree with you.  Wow.  I agree with you.  I always have.  I never thought we should have been in Iraq.  Yeah, it's been saying that for a while.  No, no, no.  I did when I was sold the bill of goods on the Midwest.  But it's been a long time since you've believed that.  Yeah.  I could give a crap if they have a democracy over there.  Who cares about those people?  They don't want it.  Can you give Obama credit for trying to withdraw this?  For going?  Yeah, you really should.  No, it's Annie. 
[00:37:30]  Give him a little credit.  No, why would I give him credit for that?  It's not his idea.  Give him a little credit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  No, I'm not giving Barry Hussein any credit.  A little bit.  You got to.  No.  You got to start looking forward to, you know, W.  Looking forward.  Yeah, the guy makes a good point, Ann.  I understand.  Give him a little credit.  A little credit.  All right.  You know something.  We'll all sit here someday.  We'll all sit here someday when other buildings are coming down or when there's a bombing in  our subways or anything else happens as far as Muslim terrorists coming and killing innocent 
[00:38:00]  people because of this weak, weak foreign policy that Obama is putting in place.  And Clinton did have.  Barry.  Barry Hussein.  Clinton did have Osama bin Laden, I believe, pretty much lined up and didn't go after him.  No.  Did not.  I'm not blaming Clinton for 9-11 at all.  I'm only saying that there was more he could have done knowing that bin Laden was a terrorist  who was funding stuff and he did not do it.  He was funding stuff.  Could I sound a dumber?  Funding stuff.  You know what I mean?  He did not take action.  He did more stuff.  All right.  We got to take a break.  We're looking at the stimulus package. 
[00:38:30]  Stimulus.  So I'm going to say that in this package, they got $260 million that they're going to be  using to re-sod the National Mall.  Is that true?  That got taken out.  Oh, okay.  But it was in there.  Yeah, but that's what they do down there.  Where's the transparency?  Where's the not business as usual?  Why did the Democrats have it in there in the first place?  They put in bargaining chips so that they could keep stuff in and take it out.  It's not supposed to negotiate like that.  That's business as usual.  Well, and it's the same thing Barry's doing. 
[00:39:00]  Nothing is changing.  President Obama.  Barry Hussein.  A little respect until he says something wrong.  He hasn't done anything wrong officially yet.  Barry Hussein.  What?  Did you pick up the paper?  Yes, I did.  Stay 10 and I'm scared crapless.  Foreign policy 0 for 2 so far.  I hate to say it.  Yeah.  0 for 2.  0 for 2.  All right, we can't go to you, Mike.  We just kind of did it.  So, quick break.  Back to the phones.  Did the phone company go broke, too?  What happened?  What's wrong?  I thought his phone went out.  I thought the phone companies all went broke.  No, no. 
[00:39:30]  Getting mail delivery is going to be five days.  We're so screwed.  I told you yesterday.  Everything we know is slowly changing.  Give it to the whores with chlamydia.  Hey, hey.  That's where our money goes to.  Hey.  The whores with rotting genitals.  Hey.  All right.  Good.  Good one.  Hey, hey.  Oh.  Opie and Anthony.  A little old school here, huh?  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:40:00]  877-212-ON-A.  A bunch of people making the same point.  Whether it's right or wrong, they are saying it.  Yeah.  Victor and Belmore.  I don't have time to go to them.  And, wow.  Sobe, I guess, in Jersey.  You can only be this mad after eight years, not one week.  No.  No.  I could be mad because it's actually been two years.  Yeah.  Okay?  Are you going to write his back?  Two years of campaigning.  So I know what this guy's about. 
[00:40:30]  And now that he's starting to enact some of this stuff, it's not like he just popped out of nowhere.  All right.  You're going to write his back the entire time, aren't you?  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Well, yeah.  If the streets are paved with gold after eight years, I'm still going to call him an ass.  Why is that?  Because he's a socialist.  He's a what?  He's a what?  Yeah.  Okay.  Barry Hussain.  Yep.  That's right.  We're moving on. 
[00:41:00]  Uh-huh.  We're moving on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're moving on.  We're moving on.  We're moving on.  We're moving on.  We're moving on.  Sure is.  We're moving on.  We're moving on.  We're moving on.  We're moving on.  Oh, yeah.  I love the instant feedback.  Jamal from Connecticut, he goes, so I'm a new listener to the show, so I just want to  make sure I got this right.  Anthony is the one who likes Obama, right?  Is that right?  They love busting him.  Yeah.  I love when the other side just busts your balls, my friend.  All right. 
[00:41:30]  If you were listening earlier, we lost another Skynyrd.  Yeah.  Of the Leonard variety.  Billy Powell passed away.  He was only 56.  He looked a lot older.  Oh.  And I mention it again because, oh boy, Johnny Van Zandt has a little comment about Billy  Powell's passing.  Kind of doing our bit.  You know how we go with, I guess God needed a keyboardist or whatever.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Johnny Van Zandt, the current lead singer of Leonard Skinner, until he passes and then 
[00:42:00]  they'll get somebody else and they'll just continue for decades.  They'll keep going.  Yeah.  They're rocking up in heaven tonight.  I'm sure.  I'm sure my brother probably says, just tell him, Billy, hey, what took you so long?  No, they're not rocking up in heaven.  No.  He's also a corpse.  Yeah.  They're both rotting on Quincy's table.  The maggots are rocking on his body. 
[00:42:30]  That's what you...  Oof.  That's nice.  Depends what you believe, my friend.  But true.  Depends what you believe.  All right.  Out of his crybaby phase.  All right.  Huh?  I'm a crybaby.  Oh.  I was.  I'll give you that.  A little bit.  A little bit.  I don't understand that.  Now I need the crybaby sound effect.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow, you do that really well.  I did it enough.  Growing up.  A little baby.  Such a little embarrassing baby. 
[00:43:00]  What an embarrassment.  Yeah.  And I need your help.  What's up?  I was watching TV last night.  I was flipping around, and I caught a little bit of loss last night.  Really?  Just a little bit.  And I know there's a lot of loss fans out there, and I want to become one of those loss fans.  But I mean, I understand you caught a little bit, but if you'd catch a little bit of last  night's episode, you're in trouble.  Really?  Yeah.  How many seasons are we up to?  Four?  Five?  I think this is season five, right?  A loss?  I haven't seen the first one yet, the new ones. 
[00:43:30]  I haven't seen the season yet.  Really?  Five.  Yeah, fifth season?  It's second episode, really.  Yeah.  Maybe third, because the first one was two hours, into season five.  I decided that I want to get into Lost.  So what I want...  Do you have a week straight that you can take off and just sit in front of a TV with DVDs?  Who needs a week when I have you?  What?  Explain Lost to me in 60 seconds.  That's impossible.  No, and then I can start watching these episodes.  It's not possible. 
[00:44:00]  No, I'm going to start the clock, and you're going to try.  I can't.  I don't even have a thought in my head.  No, you've got to, because I really want to start watching this show.  And I think, I have faith in you, my brother.  I don't.  You're a very smart man.  I don't.  And I know you can do this.  Explain Lost in 60 seconds, and then I'll watch.  And then when I come in, I can be part of the little chatter that goes on.  I notice there's Lost chatter between you and Travis and other people.  Yeah, we talk about it.  We were texting last night.  Me and Travis were texting each other last night during Lost, yeah. 
[00:44:30]  I'm not going to lie.  I feel a little left out.  I want to be more part of what's going on in front of me.  Mighty.  So can you explain Lost in 60 seconds?  No.  Can you at least try?  I can try.  All right.  Can we start the clock?  That's going to explain Lost in 60 seconds.  For me and maybe some other people out there that, they take a peek, and they're like,  you know what?  This is something I might want to start watching.  Okay.  All right?  Give it your best shot.  Okay.  Oh, God.  All right.  There's Oceanic Flight 815. 
[00:45:00]  It crashes on an island.  Got it.  And at first you just think it's like just going to be a survival story on the island, but  the island turns out to be a little mysterious.  There are creatures and things going on.  Uh-huh.  Very mysterious.  And then the initial ensemble cast of characters, I'm not going to go into their names.  I don't have enough time.  They start wandering around and exploring the island and find things that indicate other  people had been on this island.  Things?  Okay.  Got it.  And then they realized there was something called the Dharma Initiative, which made these  chambers and other things all over the island that contain weird, mysterious machines and 
[00:45:30]  items and things that sometimes help them.  They give them supplies sometimes for them.  And then I found the others.  The others were people that had been on the island.  The others?  They didn't know that they were the others.  Okay.  There's more people on the island.  And they're run by Ben.  They're run by Ben.  All right.  This guy.  He's a really bad guy.  And the others start really effing with the Oceanic Flight 815.  God damn it.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:46:00]  You didn't even get to the smoke.  I didn't get out of season one.  Oh, really?  It was in five.  I didn't get halfway through season one.  That's only season one.  Holy mother of God.  I know there's numbers and smoke and the others.  I couldn't get into all that.  The hatch.  The what?  Yes, the hatch.  All right.  We're going to try this again next week.  I mean, that's a good start, though.  It's a plane crash, but maybe they never really crashed.  Well, you know, the way some of these episodes have been going, you might be right. 
[00:46:30]  Really?  No, no.  I think there was a plane crash.  See, everyone's saying I've got to start from the beginning.  No, I'm going to use Anthony.  If we do this a couple times, I think I could just jump into season five.  So now I'm going to have to remember where I left off next week, or I have to do it all over again?  All over again.  No, I have to figure out a way to do it all in 60 seconds.  Yes, yes.  You only did one season.  What did you do?  You did like half of a season, maybe.  Maybe Travis can help you.  Maybe a little thought starter.  Travis is very good.  Next week, we're going to do this again, Travis. 
[00:47:00]  Or maybe even tomorrow.  Maybe two days.  My whole goal is to watch your brain explode.  I almost did it.  Especially on the tales of Obama stuff.  I know.  I think Anthony needs to rest a little bit.  You know, we weren't even going to do this story, but...  Someone said, I'm so far to the right that I hope Rush Limbaugh fails.  I don't know who said that on Pal Talk, but that's funny. 
[00:47:30]  God, they played right into Rush's hands.  Tell me.  Rush will have ratings through the roof.  I even want to start listening to him again.  Rush was so hoping that Obama won.  Of course.  Why doesn't he at least say that?  Like, as a professional, you've got to hope he wins because it gives you...  This guy has at least four more years of great ratings, being in the news.  Of course.  When Bush was in office, he pretty much disappeared.  You just heard about drug allegations and abuse and his cochlear implant. 
[00:48:00]  And now, right out of the gate, he's back in the news.  You go to Drudge, you see links to his comments.  I read a whole thing on what he thinks his stimulus package would be.  I never would have read anything like that, you know, over the past eight years.  That's why he's a phony like the rest of them, because this is the best thing for him personally and for his radio show.  You know?  It's the best thing that could happen to our radio show.  We're not a political talk show.  We dip into the politics, certainly. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  But this is great for our show.  Why can't Rush admit that?  Has he admitted that?  Like, thank God?  No, no, no.  He'd be dead in the water if McCain was president, as far as his radio show goes.  Yes.  No one would care as much.  It's perfect for him.  Yep.  He rode that Clinton thing, remember?  Oh, I know.  That was the heyday of Rush Limbaugh, and it was all because, you know, Clinton was in office.  Clinton put him on that.  He had someone to beat up every day.  Now he's going to beat up Barry.  Barry Hussein.  As Anthony says.  I call him Barry Hussein. 
[00:49:00]  Yep, yep, yeah.  We got to do this dirtiest hotel story.  That's cute.  Because there's a nice little ta-da moment.  Ta-da!  Stump Brain, what is this?  They did some kind of survey to find the dirtiest hotel in America?  Yeah, these guys checked out every dirty hotel all over the country, and they also tried to report on the clean ones, but nobody cares about that.  No, you like the shock of the dirty ones.  And they were talking to the owner of the dirtiest hotel. 
[00:49:30]  They went in, I think they got the night manager, or one of the clerks, to show them around.  Right, okay.  Listen to this.  Dirtiest hotel is in Times Square.  It stands tall in the glow of the theater district, and for $109 a night, you can even get a room with a view at Hotel Carter.  That is, if you can see past the cracked window in filth.  Besides being a magnet for European travelers on a budget, TripAdvisor.com says the Times Square Hotel is also a magnet for mice, roaches, and bed bugs. 
[00:50:00]  The roaches and mice, I will deny it because I never see it myself.  Man, I should have kept my old place.  I could have rented it out like a hotel with the mice and the roaches.  I got to say.  And the silverfish.  These filthy Europeans that come over here and spread their bugs all over these hotels.  The bugs were there already.  Come on.  What?  Come on.  No, you know what?  For the most part, if you're staying in an upper-end hotel, you assume that the people staying there are showered. 
[00:50:30]  But this isn't an upper-end hotel.  It hasn't been an upper-end hotel since like.  It was a welfare hotel for a while.  Over vision.  I digress.  Yes.  Yes.  I've heard stories on upper-end hotels that have bed bugs.  And it's because these filthy people come over here with their horrid habits and their filthy woman armpits, hairy armpits, and sleep in these beds and give us bed bugs along with other diseases. 
[00:51:00]  What do you think?  What do you think?  Do you think we naturally get anthrax here or some guy's got to come over with animal skins to make drumheads over?  It's just people that just feel like people bring things over here.  Before, you know, we had a lot of this travel going on, a lot of this freedom of movement between countries.  We didn't have a lot of this good stuff.  That's right.  It was a bunch of Indians minding their business.  And then some people showed up.  Knocked them off.  Had a few things.  That's right.  Blankets that were questionable.  A couple of questionable blankets.  We were the first terrorist, man. 
[00:51:30]  First terrorist, man.  First weapon of mass destruction.  Started with blankets, and now look where we're at.  I have to say the Romans were probably doing it before.  Probably.  The terrible U.S. was.  Good cop chase.  Looks like so.  Oh, that was that woman from yesterday?  Yeah, the U-Haul.  The woman in the U-Haul is classic.  Where do you think she was?  She's running.  She tried to get into another car, and then the cop is just, wham, I'm going to get you, bitch.  You can't outrun, like, the cops in this day and age.  They've got cameras and helicopters everywhere.  Where are you going, Gunners? 
[00:52:00]  Where was she going?  So what happened to her?  Why did she do what she did?  Did anybody know?  Yeah, let's get that story.  She was moving.  It's a pretty big one.  I have no idea.  I turned that off yesterday.  Dirtiest Hotel, Part 2.  Erwin Lemanglis lives in the hotel and manages it.  So how does he feel that for the third time in four years,  the West 43rd Street spot tops the website's list of dirtiest hotels in the country?  We're not the dirtiest hotel in America, right?  But you are dirty?  We're not dirty.  This is a one-star hotel, so the level of standard is as for a one-star hotel. 
[00:52:30]  A what?  It's a one-star hotel.  Oh, okay.  So as far as one-star hotels go.  Hey, they're living up to one-star.  They're living up to the one-star status.  It's not like they're trying to bamboozle anybody.  Hey, we're a one-star hotel.  You want to stay here?  We got a guy.  Oh.  Rich and Buffalo.  One-star.  One-star.  I couldn't find a room.  Yeah.  I booked a brown dwarf hotel.  It's a quasar hotel. 
[00:53:00]  A one-star hotel.  Let's go to Rich and Buffalo.  He stayed at this hotel.  Rich?  Yeah, what's up?  I came back from Iraq, and a buddy of mine who was a New York City cop hooked me up with a cheap hotel in Times Square.  It was so nasty, me and my wife had to go down to Dwayne Reed and buy our own sheets.  There was a wet bag of weed drying on the outside of the window from whoever was there before us.  Nice.  All right.  That's complimentary.  A little weed. 
[00:53:30]  A continental breakfast.  Well, you would think that if you got a hotel in Times Square that it would be okay, but they still have some really dirty things in Times Square.  Yeah, they haven't cleaned up the area entirely yet.  If you're at the W or somewhere like that, that's one thing.  If you're staying at some unknown hotel, it's a problem.  Like Patty.  Stalker Patty stays at one of these welfare hotel kind of places.  Sure.  And from the looks, when she gets on Pal Talk, there's one swinging light bulb over her head.  It's like a jail cell. 
[00:54:00]  I stayed in one of those hotels after we signed our big deal.  Oh, yeah.  They gave us a choice.  They were like, all right, we want to give you guys.  Oh, remember?  These were the old days.  Believe me.  It was a thing.  It was like, we'll give you guys a little perk.  What do you want?  And Ope wanted to be able to stay in the city for a few nights a week.  To get away from.  Yeah.  And to make the commute easier.  Yeah.  You know, I was smart.  And I wanted him to pay for my parking.  That's right.  So I went for parking. 
[00:54:30]  No, but this is a different story.  It was actually the Park Central, which wasn't bad.  At the time?  It wasn't bad.  It wasn't bad.  It was doable.  I'm talking about the hotel that was in Borat, the Wellington.  I'll take a picture.  Oh, the Wellington.  I pass it every morning.  I'll take a picture tomorrow morning.  And we signed a really nice, our first big, like, wow, we're going to actually make money  and we're going places.  Oh, the good old days.  And the paper was all over it.  And we went out to celebrate.  And for once, this wasn't my fault as far as, like, not giving a crap and being cheap 
[00:55:00]  and all.  All the hotels were sold out because something was going on.  I had to get a hotel at the Wellington.  And I was drying my underwear on the radiator as I was reading about how we are, like, the  next big thing on radio.  Yeah.  Well, because I didn't have clothes.  I didn't know we were staying in that night because we were celebrating.  I think you ended up going home and I was like, wow, I'm going to stay.  It's easier.  You washed your underwear in the sink?  Yeah.  Really?  Because I didn't have clothes. 
[00:55:30]  I should have went and got underwear, I guess, would have been the move.  Dwayne Reed.  Right.  I'll wear the same underwear two, three days in a row.  Hell no.  Why, do you sweat a lot?  Oh, my God.  I can barely last a day in my underwear.  Really?  Yeah.  I do some change-outs halfway through the day.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Got to change the clip halfway through.  Yeah, I have to.  But I probably should have got underwear.  But I think I was a little buzzed and a little hungover, too.  So I'm like, you know what?  Yeah, I was.  So I just drove home.  Yeah.  So I did the right thing and drove home. 
[00:56:00]  So I had nothing to sleep in.  The hotel room was horrendous.  I was right outside, I think, one of the letters that just kind of lit up all night long.  One of those type of deals.  Yeah.  And I was in the bed completely nude as my stuff was drying on the radiator so I could wear  it tomorrow.  Bed bugs.  And then I got up and I'm reading about how great we are in the paper the next day.  I'm like, if they only knew.  Saying it, one of those red neon signs blinking in your window hotels.  All right, dirtiest hotel.  This is the big get in the story.  The whole reason why we're doing this. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  Because now where we left you, it's a one-star hotel.  They're living up to the standards.  They don't believe they should be considered the dirtiest hotel.  And then this little tidbit comes out.  Its reputation as a dump comes not just from grime, but also crime.  Two years ago, a cleaning woman found a woman's corpse stuffed in a garbage bag under a guest's  bed.  It happened in room...  Oh, in room...  237.  237, Doc.  You know, you can't really defend your hotel at this point. 
[00:57:00]  You know that day we're going to...  That's good.  What?  And he says, Opie, are you staying at the hotel from Big?  Were you crying when you heard the gunshot?  You just start crying?  With the Spanish guys arguing outside the bathroom?  Outside, you put the pillow over your head.  You're all afraid.  Look, it was a horrendous room, man.  They might have made that place a little better.  I don't know, though.  Yeah. 
[00:57:30]  No idea.  But here's the corpse story.  They would have rented out this room again if the cleaning lady didn't find the corpse  under the bed.  Stuffed in a garbage bag under a guest's bed.  It happened in room 608.  And you would think guests who know it happened here...  False.  There is no room 608.  What?  False.  Sometimes the complaints will be false.  It happened in room 608.  And you would think guests who know it happened here wouldn't want to stay in this room. 
[00:58:00]  Not the case.  It's actually in demand on All Souls Day.  Another guy will ask me.  And then I said, oh, it's already booked.  It's already...  Somebody's already in there.  Funny.  I don't know.  Creepy.  Yeah.  So now...  Creepy.  Well, now the ghouls out there, they want to stay in that room.  There's a whole society of people that like to stay in these rooms where horrific things  happen.  Ghouls.  Whether it's ghosts or...  Yeah.  Or where people died.  There's a whole thing online for dead MySpace pages. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  For dead people.  That's cool.  Murderers.  I can't even deal with that.  People that have killed other people.  Yeah.  Nope.  Like Dead Space or something.  I can't even call it.  No, thank you.  Let's say hi to Skip, the trucker.  Skip, what are you hauling?  Hey, we're hauling Coca-Cola today.  Nice.  Oh.  You got a nice load.  All American.  Yes, we do.  All right.  What do you got there, Skip?  I was going to say, I don't remember ever hearing that King Jaffee Joe forever infested 
[00:59:00]  the Waldorf Astoria.  Ha ha.  Take me.  Oh, can we play one of our favorite clips?  We got to do a whole list of our favorite clips.  That dumb anchor.  Thank you, Skip.  This is the dumb news guy, whatever he was.  Somehow, we're going to have to try to figure out our top 10 favorite clips.  That'd be tough.  This one should be right up there, man.  Top 10 all-time clips.  Wow.  Yeah.  At least in the last, whatever, four years would be good.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, the Miller, that's got to be right up there. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, that's right up there.  Miller.  The freaking Leprechaun and the Tree.  I don't know about the Leprechaun and the Tree.  It was a good one, but not one of my...  I think there's 10 better ones than that.  Is he like, take me to the Waldorf Astoria?  That's a good one, but I think that would be up there in the top 20.  For the rest of America, there's a local channel, New York One.  Ugh.  They're lame.  Yeah.  And they were doing some kind of report, and this is what happened.  The guy...  Hold on, hold on.  I guess it needs a better setup.  The guy... 
[01:00:00]  The reporter was trying to have a little fun with whatever story he was doing, threw out  a little line from Coming to America, and the guy back in the studio just left him  hanging.  He bombed.  Yeah, the reporter certainly bombed, but the guy in the studio could have helped him along  a little bit.  Left him hanging.  Hanging there.  It's just great.  So that's what's happening, but the big story is traffic, Pat.  You know, and every time I think of the Waldorf Astoria and I think of world leaders,  I think of Coming to America when James Earl Jones...  All right.  Hold on. 
[01:00:30]  Eddie Murphy.  We want to dissect this?  A little bit.  Go back a little bit.  He started losing it right there.  He couldn't really remember.  No confidence.  Now he's got no confidence.  He's rolling into this stuttering.  He doesn't understand the concept of punching out.  No, no.  This is just going bad now, right from the start.  See, if you could say punching out, you could save yourself.  Two geese just flew into his mouth.  It's almost like he sensed it was about to bomb because he should have cut it at James Earl 
[01:01:00]  Jones and Coming to America, and it seems like he meant to cut it there, but then decided  to explain it, and then it turned into a riff.  It's tragic.  It was a hard...  You could almost feel him peeling his skin off like an onion layer.  This is a slow motion wreck footage, like when they do the crash test dummies into a wall.  Because he tried to explain the joke before.  Can you just play the thing?  It's so big.  Go back a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  Story is traffic, Pat.  You know, and every time I think of the Waller of Astoria and I think of world leaders, 
[01:01:30]  I think of Coming to America when...  See?  Right there, he should have cut it.  Bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye 
[01:02:00]  other than the world of the story it makes sense for  five foreign policy for the masses i guess it is roger  yeah i mean i mean you you've boiled it all down presidents are busy with  meetings  waldorf story is a good place  chock-full of information  uh... and and of course we we know the uh... the traffic restriction will uh... 
[01:02:30]  we're going to put all this traffic information on our website as well  yeah okay thank you  it is one of my favorite yeah it's very close i just realized it all great that  all fairness to the anchor he definitely was sitting there going wow i can't make  anything  yeah he's like yeah yeah did you hear the anchor smack his face because the  anchor said up foreign policy for the masses for the masses meaning i guess you  just explained it for everyone dummy dummy like uh... and then he lists the 
[01:03:00]  childish things he's done  i forget he just listed a couple of things that the guy did wrong like like  that was just  oh  dumb  fantastic okay that yeah that clip is in my top ten now  but just the the uncomfortable pause and then  yeah  yeah  hey we're talking about obama a lot uh... this morning  barry hussein  well yeah  you call him barry  i call him barry hussein  i call him barack  obama  wow  um  we got a new bit sort of it's sort of a take on an old bit

[01:09:00]  off the ground  because we had so much fun  with jocktober  yes  we rested the bit for a while  but now i think we need to  bring it back on a  on a you know  on an every once in a while  basis  so uh sam's listening to  other radio shows  and he found a terrific bit  that really needs some airplay  right  well yeah  i felt like my uh  show prep was slipping lately  and so i started going to more  of the show prep websites  aha  kind of get myself ramped up again  and found a really funny bit  for you guys to play today 
[01:09:30]  sometimes you gotta kind of  look outside yourself like that  yeah  you know if you  if you're just uh  complacent with  your own talents  and what you do  you might be uh  missing out  so look at other people  what they're doing  i am i'm not too big  to say there are funnier  and more creative people  out there than me  like the people on this website  who make these things for us  oh  i can't wait  hey i want more  ty cobb info too  because one guy  alex in buffalo  we're gonna continue  with uh this 
[01:10:00]  this sam thing  there's a myth  and i want to know  if this is true  that ty cobb killed the guy  with a baseball bat  and then hit a home run  just for snoring  and then hit a home run  with the same bat  the next day  that's probably nonsense  but he did  who knows though  his mother did  uh murder his father  wow  and i believe  it was  there was a different reports  where ty had to uh  back her up in court  but i think what was happening  was  but ty  at least ty  wow  robert wool played uh  the guy who wrote his biography  who hung out with him  and and i think the real story 
[01:10:30]  that ty eventually told him  was that uh  his father  suspected his mother  was cheating  so he came home  and uh  caught her  and maybe it wasn't  the mother who shot him  maybe it was the lover  who shot the father  but ty said  i took a kajer blade  boy little fella  i think that ty said  the last thing my father saw  was the man who was  effing his wife  wow  before he was shot  oh  i think that was uh  he had some horrible 
[01:11:00]  childhood  trauma  guess you gotta give him  a little uh leeway  georgia peach  and the greatest quote  about basketball ever  oh  yeah  oh no really  yeah  if it was 2006  it's all i'd want to do  is play it  gotta play it a little safer  though  let me hear that one  now i'm curious  if we played that  i'd fire me  now i gotta read it  online at least  get the quote online  so you get our reaction 
[01:11:30]  when we read it  all right so uh  the bit  it's what other radio  shows are doing  do the bit  sam found  obama cancels  american idol  because  because  because why  well  you see  obama  has a thing about  stopping torture  and  oh right  some people are like  because american idol  is hot right now  obama is hot right now  so we gotta combine  combine the two  and say  combine  right  the two together 
[01:12:00]  did those auditions  the bad ones  that you have to listen to  when you're watching  the tryout shows  are just like  would be considered  torture  torture  just like  waterboarding  yeah  yeah  okay  all right let's take a listen here  this week on american idol  you'll never guess  who shows up  hello  barack obama  what are you doing here  so sorry  simon  randy  parlor  new judge  i'm gonna have to shut you down  see we've banned torture  and that's what listening to these bad auditions is 
[01:12:30]  we need to stop the butchering of mariah carey's song  you can't shut us down  we're the number one show on the telly  i can and i will  i won the election  and simon i'm getting tough on immigration  you're being deported  that's barack obama on american idol  this week on fox  do the bit  do the bit  do the bit  that's cool though  how'd they get obama to voice that  and simon  oh my god  i don't even know what to say after that  i was gonna ask how they got jesse jackson to uh 
[01:13:00]  voice it  yeah yeah  but a lot of the subtleties if you pay attention  oh  yes  you know simon's the british one  right  yeah  they call it telly  oh  that's why because if you listen closely he says  i did notice that on the telly  i didn't ask that  yeah  we're the biggest show on the telly  right  and it's like  remember he's british  we wouldn't say that here in america  no  but we're not british  no  we're american  it's that subtle stuff that really is what brings that bit home  that's where you get two or three listens out of it to you know really get the 
[01:13:30]  oh you know they play that  like hey  and people are just clamoring for the  obama american idol bit  so this isn't  an individual station this is something that a lot of stations are  many many stations  wow we gotta  we definitely gotta try harder  i wanna know who  we got some competition out there  i wanna know who  is  please list the stations that are playing that horrendous bit  and playing that bit  seriously  maybe we just debuted it 
[01:14:00]  yeah maybe  i hope so because i'd hate to think anyone in this business is playing that but i know better  not only are they playing it but they're taking credit for it as if they made it the  yeah yeah that's what these uh  that's what they do  they do with the the show prep  wow  that  was a hunk  of  like i have never heard  but they got the british accent down  they did  yeah they sure did  it sounded uh  just like them  yeah  it was  it was amazing  all right  thanks sam  my pleasure 
[01:14:30]  look forward to another one of those  what are other radio shows doing  something like that  yeah yeah  we'll work on the name a little bit  i kinda like it  well  it rolls right off the tongue  what other radio shows are doing  i like that  it's catchy  yeah  it's like what's the haps  well  nothing's that catchy  that's true  what happened to what's the haps  nothing's haps  yeah nothing's happening because it's cold outside  and nobody likes to stop and talk to people when it's cold outside  they just say it's cold  good one 
[01:15:00]  let's go to mike in reno  nice to watch it  yes mike  hey i was calling to uh  i tell you boys that ty cobb used to sit on the top step of the dugout  and sharpen his cleats to scare the uh infielders on the other team  yes he would sharpen them and he would slide really really in a way  to really stab somebody with his spikes  what an ass  ty cobb ruled  how did he die  one more thing  jimmy  happy birthday  thank you  i think he died of old age 
[01:15:30]  i mean he was very serious  again he's hooked on  it might have been morphine he was hooked on  he was injecting something into his stomach  he was had cancer  uh ty cobb's ugliest scandal  the georgia peach  once beat a heckling fan who had no hands  no way  i'm telling you this guy rules  he was a bad  wow  yeah you want to read this one  yeah sure man  in may of 1912  at new york highlander park  the detroit tigers are playing the hometown new york highlanders  in the stands behind home plate 
[01:16:00]  it was a highlander fan named claude luker  who was giving detroit's ty cobb a tough time  a really tough time  according to spectators who were there  luker hurled insults and empathetic cobb  every time the georgia peach came to the plate  by the end of the fifth inning  cobb warned the highlanders manager and the umpires  that if the man wasn't ejected from the game  there was going to be some serious trouble  oh no  nothing was done to the rambunctious fan  so when he called the notoriously racist cobb 
[01:16:30]  a half  in the bottom of the sixth inning  the ferocious outfielder  climbed into the crowded stands  leaped upon the man and began beating him senseless  other fans began pleading with cobb  to stop the physical attack  because the foul-mouthed mr luker had no hands  he had apparently lost them years earlier  in an industrial accident  and the crowd pleaded  as the crowd pleaded  ty responded as he pummeled the man  i don't care if he's got no feet  american league commissioner ban johnson 
[01:17:00]  who was at the game  immediately suspended cobb  indefinitely from baseball  in a surprise show of support from his teammates  who did not exactly adore cobb  the entire roster went on strike  the next day and refused to play  unless cobb was allowed to return to the team  the commissioner told detroit's owner frank navan  that he would fine the team  five thousand dollars for every game  they refused to play  navan pleaded with his players  but they simply would not budge  wow  i would love to know  oh  that's a great story 
[01:17:30]  yeah  he was uh  flinging out the old  you're half uh n-word  boy that's all it took to get cobb into the stands  yeah  he um  he used to bat in a really weird way  he obviously has an over 400 average  uh  i think it was a 406 lifetime average  i'm going to guess  and he would bat with his hands separated  uh  he was a really great player  oh really  he has hands like  instead of  yeah  touching your hands together  on the bat  yeah  bottom uh  pinky over top  thumb and forefinger  he would uh  yeah  i don't know how long of a separation  it almost looked like he was gonna bunt 
[01:18:00]  but not that far apart  yeah  and he would just hit the ball that way  he slapped a lot of base hits  yeah yeah  i don't think  he didn't hit a lot of homer  no he hated homeruns  he thought they were awful  really  yes  oh really  yeah  i thought they were stupid  and a great quote on babe ruth  well he ran well for a fat man  that was his quote on babe ruth  that is set on him  i love him  uh  people are saying he died of a codeine overdose  oh was it  was codeine that he was hooked on  uh  camera morphean  oh for two i was  blue healer is usually good uh  for some knowledge so  yeah he was in his 70s  he was uh  he was old 
[01:18:30]  that's old for back when he died  yeah  yeah  not a lot of guys living past 70 back  uh  back in tycobs time  all right uh  we'll take a break  we got a  we still got a lot to do  we're still looking over the stimulus package  that uh  that's going through washington there  i'm not too stimulus  there's some  there's some good things on this thing  we'll explain next  you got more too  on stump brain  yes  all right  give me some more  and uh  we got more on joe torrey  his book  wow  i'm really surprised  joe torrey's talking like this 
[01:19:00]  really surprised  but he is  he's got a new book coming out  we got some more of his uh  more of the stuff he's talking about  in his book  and i got to talk about the post office  going down to five days a week  and  blah blah blah  yeah  opie and anthony  that's right 
[01:19:30]  you got that right  opie and anthony  we're gonna go over the stimulus thing in a second here  stimulus  yeah yeah  jimmy's uh  what do you got over there  just for tomorrow morning  the uh  the artie lang show  myself and artie  doing the tower theater  february 21st  tomorrow morning  that goes on sale  that's on live nation.com  and uh  tomorrow morning  at 9 a.m  in uh  near philadelphia  me and artie  doing the tower theater  uh  that will probably sell very well  so if you want tickets  yes i'm certain  go tomorrow morning  to live nation.com  very good 
[01:20:00]  won't be having  no salty language  at that show  oh yeah  i bet  that's the new jim norton  i hate the new jim norton  ah yeah  i don't go for the salty stuff  nah  that's the new jim norton  ah  found jesus  yeah  that'd be like the worst thing  if you found jesus  and just started doing like your comedy  but it was all  but you don't tell anyone  jesus  you want them to find out slowly  oh  you thought it was funny  yeah  if i didn't understand where the joke should be  yeah  if i was like  and the plane was crashing 
[01:20:30]  and everyone lived  bless his name  now that's funny  two heathens walk into a bar  they own it  oh what a disaster that would be  please never do that  i think people would like it  i think he should do that  he recites footprints  yeah  footprints in the sand  well the stimulus package  oh my goodness  we're all trying to decipher this  aren't we now  well 
[01:21:00]  first of all  well it's 647 pages  yeah that's  when i hear about these  these things in washington  and it's like  well the  it's 647 pages  and you're  and you know  you're you're  you're hoping that the people down there  do the right thing  who's reading 647 pages of this  yeah  for real  it  uh  it's business as usual  this is the transparency  that obama was talking about  this is what um  you're you're supposed to uh 
[01:21:30]  get along  uh with uh  non-partisan  uh  um  all all the crap  that he preached  within days  i'm just seeing right through it  that's the transparency  you can see right through him now  please  well anthony  yeah  just like everyone else  we're kind of deciphering this thing  for everybody  for the people out there  yes  and uh  i'm learning this morning  that 25 million dollars of this  yeah  will go to new atv trails 
[01:22:00]  25 million  for new atv trails  are going to new  all-terrain vehicle trails  yes  how is that helping  the economy  i guess you have to  but build a trail  i don't know  anytime i've been on an atv  you make your own trail  you make your own trail  that's the fun of the whole  right  the experience  you're kind of exploring  yeah when you get on a real trail  you're like boring  oh my 
[01:22:30]  let's make some new ones  uh  well then you got 650 million  going toward uh  digital tv  coupons  what's that  oh well  that's for the poor people  yeah that's to uh  subsidize those converter boxes  for the dtv conversion  so everybody can get  all the new channels  i'm not even you know  that that  it shouldn't be in a stimulus package  uh  it should just be something  that's completely separate  uh  but you know  people need their tvs  and not everybody has cable  or satellite  so if you still have an antenna 
[01:23:00]  you're going to be left out  in the cold  without any television  um  so i don't even have a problem  with that  with spending  you know  the government spending money  to uh  allow people to watch tv  but  not in the stimulus package  sorry  well you can't really call it  a stimulus package  if uh  most of this stuff  isn't going to take effect  for what  a couple of years  none of this is going to go  into effect  anytime soon  we're going to notice this  in the next year  and the year after  i do believe  three percent of this  will hit in the next 12 months  and the majority of it 
[01:23:30]  three percent  in uh  2010 and 2011  but we need help now  yeah  let's set up for the election cycles  uh  400 million anthony  for the national endowment  for the arts  the arts  well that's what they love too  is uh  financing things like  um  the crucifix  in a jar of urine  well the NEA  is another one  uh  they just  they want to be able to do  whatever they want to do  and call it art  i guess uh  i don't know  where do you not sound like  a cranky old man 
[01:24:00]  when you're talking about art  it's really a tough one  oh it is  i don't mind what you do  i don't care if you want to  uh  urinate in a jar  and then put a crucifix in it  and uh  call it art  it doesn't bother me  i'm not one of these like  you know  or or the  the virgin mary  made out of elephant dung  was another one that  uh there was a big problem  with when they put them  on display  i don't care  what you want to call art  or what you want to make  but i don't want to  pay for it  that's the big thing  i don't want to pay for it  there's a lot of little  youngsters out there 
[01:24:30]  that want to be doing  their toodly doodly do thing  pick up a  paintbrush  and some paint  and watch bob ross  i'm gonna be an artist  um  greg brady's leftovers  from whack bag  f  in capital letters  f  i love you aunt  but your hatred  for president obama  is mother effing maddening  what  can we give him a year or so  to get things turned around  i told you before  i gave him two years  during the campaign  that started  two years ago  it's like two years 
[01:25:00]  but uh  and i've seen his platform  i see what he's done  i've seen him  uh  sidestep scandal  with people he knows  and and i've seen the press  treat this guy like the pope  and and and  he's teflon  over the past two years  whenever anything's uh  gotten in his way  so uh  no  i'm not gonna give him time  i know what he's about  what do you mean no  you can't just say no  i'm not gonna give him time  why would i give him time  if you know  what he's all about already 
[01:25:30]  give him a little wiggling room  he's a socialist  how about a little wiggling room  i don't want to wiggle  i don't want to wiggle  with obama  when are you gonna be on hannity  i want to be on hannity  so bad  go  i don't always have to do  things together  you go do hannity  i will do hannity  make that call  immediately then  please  make that call  okay  they always try to book us together  screw that  you go and do hannity  i insist  book me on hannity  i would love it  i will be  hated  people will 
[01:26:00]  call hannity right now  he will get more hate mail  from me  right on there  and not because you know  i'm a shock jock right  just my point of view  is very caustic  right  and uh  i i think um  a lot of liberals  would uh  not enjoy what i had to say  yeah  i watch his show  um  pretty much nightly  and i like that segment  where they have the panel  uh-huh  uh  and and  last night i was just watching it  just you're  chomping at the bit  to start yelling  see this is  we need to like  it's you know 
[01:26:30]  you go and do that  and i'll go do like uh  cities of the underworld  ooh  you go check out some tombs  i hate when they book us together  let's  you need to do hannity  all right  let's start there  i'm pushing you  that's  do hannity  i'll do hannity  i gotta uh  wow  i gotta cut my hair  you know  you go on like you  like  like  like  like  you  dressed like a soldier  in kevlar  in a remote location  right  deep in his bunker 
[01:27:00]  anthony refuses to leave his house  so we have to  set this up this way  i would i would love to see you on that  i would too  all right  iraq's making the call  because we do have a  a hannity connection  maybe we can even get him on the phone  let's let's  let's broker the deal right now  yeah  live on our show  let's do it  uh  maybe i could  my friend ann emailed me again  a nice thing  ann coulter  yeah you know she mentioned  me to hannity  she's very sweet to me  and uh  so if you want to talk to ann  you can talk to short  if i can use my power  my connections to help you  perfect  uh 
[01:27:30]  you hold your uh  republicans in your pockets  like so many nickels and dimes  yes  you know if you hold these pundits in your pockets  there's some  surely you can let us  you can let us  wet our beaks  wet our beaks  yeah anthony's gonna be at hannity  we're gonna make that happen  it should happen  hannity loves you guys man  20 million  i don't have any time for hannity  20 million dollars  i like him too  but uh  what am i doing on that show  20 million dollars for uh  national mall lawn  so  that's true  20 million dollars to what  yeah it got knocked down 
[01:28:00]  from 200 million  they were gonna redo the whole  re-sod it  they're gonna re-sod it  how does it take that much money  to re-sod  it's huge  that's where i'm at  they just had 2 million people  walking on it  they're probably looking at it  like the stimulus part  is the jobs it will create  i mean it's amazing how  and i didn't like russia's point  when he was rebutting  when they were attacking them  because one of the people  who were giving a bailout  were gonna use the money  to refurbish the office  or redo the office  and he's like  won't they have to pay for furniture  won't they have to hire a worker  it's almost like  that's crap 
[01:28:30]  you can't justify extravagance  when the taxpayers  are bailing you out  by going well  technically employees  will have to do this  you know what i mean  it's like 20 million dollars  or 200 million dollars  to refurbish a lawn  just because  you'll have to pay workers  to refurbish the lawn  is not a good enough  reason  no  i don't like russia's explanation  on that either  it's not  i don't know  i honestly think  i like russia's idea  about cutting taxes  on the upper end  of businesses  and i'm not talking about me 
[01:29:00]  or anything  i'm just capital gains taxes  cut those  to all time lows  then you get people  reinvesting in the country  and  trickles down  trickle down works  trickle up doesn't work  it doesn't  no  trickle up poverty  hey what do we got  i left the message form  alright let's broker it  i mean i want him  on the phone  in minutes here  and i want to book  anthony on the show  ok  we're pushing anthony  out the door  he needs to do Hannity 
[01:29:30]  i love to  use the n-word a lot  he loves that  what  he loves that  don't even say that  oh he loves that  he knows i'm responsible  and i have to be  wasn't he the one  that said he's never  even thought  of the word before  he's in a position  where he can't  i understand  but uh  but that's just silly  in that way  we all think things  in that way  we all think horrific things  i mean uh  yeah when  when somebody wrongs you  you instantly want  the worst for them  so if it 
[01:30:00]  if it's only name calling  it's going to be  the worst name possible  so you  you do  kind of  uh  get into that mode  where you're  you're just  primal  you know  it's almost like  if if you're  standing there  and some really rude  fat lady steps  on your foot  uh  and doesn't apologize  you're not gonna go  god damn you  and your short hair  and yellow  pants  yeah  you're gonna go  you fat bitch  yeah and it's not  just gonna be  wow she was rude  for stepping on my foot  like anyone 
[01:30:30]  is gonna go  oh my god  you slob  it's it's a human  reaction  absolutely  people are so  quick to just  dismiss their humanity  their basic instincts  we we we have  ingrained in us  like dogs  and cats  and everything else  certain um  things that are  just instinctive  that we do  as human beings  and and  one of them is  when we get angry  we seem to lash out  a bit  we say horrific things  and we at least  think them  you know 
[01:31:00]  unless you're a  god fearing christian  no even them  yeah  even them  they're the biggest  hypocrites  i agree  and the hippiest  crits i ever saw  uh  well hold on  now i'm gonna  take issue with that  uh  i don't think that's  the type of talk  we need here  we can have fun  and still keep it  christian  oh no  oh no  it's christian jimmy  what's wrong with  that  praise his name  praise his name  oh no no no  no no no  i hate christian jimmy  well i want to  have a fun show  that anyone can 
[01:31:30]  tune into with  their family  oh my god  christian jimmy  stinks  well you know  what really stinks  what  the the sulfur  odor coming out  of hell  packed with people  like you  praise his name  praise his name  we have some  religious music  while we talk  to christian  christian jimmy  oh no  why not  i shouldn't have  hatred in my heart  but i do for  christian jimmy  i tolerate  needs to be saved  gregory  it needs to be  saved anthony  whoa  needs to be saved 
[01:32:00]  from what  i'm doing my own  saving  from yourself  from ourselves  yeah  why we're doing  well i think i'm a  nice person uh  uh generally speaking  we do a show  that's a little  controversial but  i mean we don't  have to go to the  extreme of just  being like you  well he's forgiven  you for 2002  praise his name  born again  i hate praise his  name  why  that's true because  you're too busy  praising the name  of joe consumer  and of product  buyer 
[01:32:30]  you should praise  the name of he  who makes it all  possible  the almighty dollar  is uh  that's right that's  who you are  the church of the  almighty dollar  well i've given up  my membership to  that church  that's right  think this is  going to hurt  ticket sales  i've joined  the good lord  university  and that's where  i get my education  praise his name  praise his name  oh good god  kristen jimmy's  gonna be playing  a lot of empty  houses  i don't think so 
[01:33:00]  you make it seem  like god fearing  people don't enjoy  a good laugh  yes we do  well good luck  to you  yes we do  i can't quite see  you playing a club  and doing your act  there's a great  a great amount  of humor  in letters from  paul to the  corinthians  and the parables  there's much  hidden humor  oh yeah  you got just  uh  hymn after hymn  of uh  funny stuff  you could say  on stage  you sure do  yes  praise his name 
[01:33:30]  that's what i like  to hear  that's now  that's a radio  program  that's wonderful  christian jimmy  god are we gonna  hate that  oh i'm gonna  hate that one  i know he's gonna  catch me off guard  being christian jimmy  yeah  i'm gonna answer  seriously  well it's not me  speaking i'm simply  a vessel  ah  i'm being  i i simply convey  a message  praise his name  oh okay  oh 
[01:34:00]  didn't even have to  say his name  praise it  i'll stick with my  oh  i don't like  oh  it's a scary  church  yeah  that's that scary  church  don't put religion  in it  you're just becoming  one with yourself  do you um  when you meditate  do you um  i just started this  thing i don't know  what i do  i kind of like  no you don't  oh everyone else  is oh  and i'm like  what is that  i think it helps  block i'm guessing

[01:37:30]  them together  and then picture  the fire department  fishing  you out from  under a bed  because the  rose was  flammable  you had a  bunch of  them with  flames  people are  saying op  you're right  you shouldn't  have shared  that  now danny has  to show me  old boobs  stop  look what  happens  to boobs  when women  get old  that is  put that  somewhere  put that  picture somewhere  so people can  enjoy it  there's an  old lady  short hair  and giant  glasses and  the tannest 
[01:38:00]  face i've  ever seen  she looks  like george  hamilton's  head  on a giant  old pair  of breasts  she's atrocious  you can't  describe those  breasts  they are  completely  deflated  that's what  you got to  look forward to  all you guys  out there  that like the  big boobies  gravity  wow  i turned the  corner on that  i don't need  the big boobies  anymore  i think that's  a i think  i'm getting  well that's a  while ago  yeah you used  to be into  that  i think every  i think every  guy starts  with oh  big boobies  never  you were  never into  big boobies 
[01:38:30]  never  really  jimmy big  boobies  one time in  your life  i'm not  talking now  like i think  i don't care  how big the  rack is i  want to just  put my face  in it and  make animal  noise  oh god we're  in silly time  no it's um  you were never  into big boobies  no it's all  about proportion  yeah but i'm  talking about  you were 12  or 13 when  you didn't know  you didn't even  know anybody  you didn't even  know that fat  came with big  boobies  you just knew 
[01:39:00]  big boobies  ruled  i was always  into um  girls my own  age  so when i was  that age i was  just into girls  that were my  age  so i never  was into like  at 12 and 13  looking at women  with giant racks  like it just  didn't do me  any you know  they they they  it was too much  like a parent or  a teacher or  something that  matronly  matronly  yes  matronly  but didn't  you like a  certain part  on a girl  yeah i liked  it all  we all go  through that 
[01:39:30]  i liked it  all but it  was uh  i was more  of an ass  guy you know  i liked the  girl's nice  ass when i  was uh  growing up  do you ever  go grazing in  the hallway  it's called  frontage  where you bump  your knuckles  into the back  of her ass  cheeks and  then you go  home and you  just scrap  thinking about  it  it's the  dirty  the greatest  like kid  rape  like when  you're a kid  not kid  rape  don't get  me wrong  it's like  what you  would  equate  you're  committing  a crime  we thought  we were cool  because we  did uh  et's  we called  them  oh elbow 
[01:40:00]  yeah yeah yeah  dude and we  thought we were  the coolest  dudes  me and my  stupid little  nerdy gang  because you know  i hung out with  more nerds than  anything  and we would  uh we would get  a little et  the elbow  blank  and we would  like think it  was like  we were like  the man  but driving  a bone  into a saw  you can't  your elbow  has no feeling  yeah i understand  it was more of a  brushing thing  like crowded  hallways and  stuff and then  you would report  back to your  gang oh i got  a bunch of  et's going to 
[01:40:30]  six period  class  that's why um  just so nerdy  man that's why  we had talked  about it many  times but that's  why square dancing  was so cool  when they did  that in gym  class  uh because  it was like  full contact  on uh on  a girl  so you you  know when  certain square  dance things  you got to do  you had to put  your hand around  the girl's waist  you kind of  hold her hand  sure and  that was  so sexual  as a kid  i would just  start breathing  heavy just 
[01:41:00]  like grabbing  a girl's waist  like that  at like a  young age when  you're like 10  that was hardcore  action  in school  that for that  age that  accordion door  and the gym  opened up  and it was  like  we get to  touch girls  yeah and the  girls come over  uh and  you pair off  and then uh  you know you're  touching girls  swing your partner  promenade  and then you put  your hand in front  your your hand  on her like hip  i was i swear  i would breathe  heavy  i get so worked 
[01:41:30]  up just  because you're  touching a girl  it was yeah  wow  oh yeah  yeah  all right we  can continue  with this  and more on  the stimulus  package because  we're really  deciphering it  there's some  great ones  coming up  the sexually  transmitted disease  one  oh yeah  yeah  and uh  other ones  that are in  this stimulus  package that  will drive  anthony a  bit nutty  today  opium anthony  stay there  i'm liking the  show today man  having a good  time opium anthony  jim norton  more ty cobb 
[01:42:00]  stuff  oh my god  it's it's  you never know  where this show  is gonna go  it was just a  dumb little thing  that was in  the news i guess  today  first five members  of the baseball  hall of fame  announced 73  years ago today  for the people  that care  it was babe  ruth ty cobb  honus wagner  christy matthewson  walter johnson  and then we just  started talking  about ty cobb  and how how  much of a dick  this guy was  we had the great  story about how  he beat up a  fan because 
[01:42:30]  the fan was  harassing him  and called him  a half a blank  because ty cobb  was racist so  he kind of threw  it back in his  face and then  called him a  derogatory name  for an african  american  oh yeah  and called  half a  an n  beat the crap  out of the guy  even though the  guy had no  hands and now  we're getting  more ty cobb  knowledge you got  some favorites  here jimmy  all of them  all of them  really  it's impossible  to convey these  yeah  oh the last one  is amazing  you see the last 
[01:43:00]  little  oh yeah  the little blurb  that doesn't say  a lot  only four people  from baseball  attended  cobb's funeral  he was  at that time  undoubtedly the  greatest player  ever  I mean he was  sure  he was the  guy  four people  from baseball  which ones are  worth  I didn't get to  read these  are we going to  read them all  you really can't  there's no way  you can do  they're all brutal  they're too  brutal  and you want to  try one  because you know  what it is  it's not  they're so brutal 
[01:43:30]  that it's not funny  unless you can say  the brutality  but you can't even  say it  well the one  in 1912  we can start there  in June of 1912  three men jumped  Cobb and his wife  in Detroit  Cobb pulled his gun  but it wouldn't fire  so he chased down  one of the fleeing  thieves and beat  the man's face  to an unrecognizable  pulp  with the butt  of his pistol  pistol whipped  yes  all the other ones  are so racist  the chambermaid  can we do it 
[01:44:00]  somehow  I mean this is  history  let's see  in 1908  Cobb knocked down  an African-American  asphalt spreader  who had accidentally  spattered some tar  on his trousers  the same year  the black newspaper  the Chicago Defender  reported Cobb  had kicked  a chambermaid  down a flight  of stairs  after she objected  to being called  a  oh my god  in 1909  without provocation  Cobb slapped  a black elevator 
[01:44:30]  operator  at the hotel  Euclid  in Cleveland  when the hotel  detective  who was also  black intervened  Cobb pulled a knife  and slashed him  Jesus  this guy  how did this guy  survive  you would think  someone would have  he was  a problem  he slept with a  loaded pistol  under his pillow  alright  he was so afraid  and here it says  in spring training  in 1907  Kumia  considered a racist  by many  oh wait a minute  Cobb  fought a black  groundskeeper 
[01:45:00]  over the condition  of the Tiger  spring training  field in Augusta  Georgia  and ended up  choking the man's  wife  which intervened  what a maniac  just a maniac  wow  I don't think  I don't think  I saw the  Ty Cobb movie  I say I don't think  is this stuff in it  no  all this  all this stuff  should be in a Ty  Cobb movie  him being a racist  absolutely isn't it  yeah  Tommy Lee Jones  as an actor  oh great  I would for free 
[01:45:30]  just do the lines  he got to do  it was  he was really good  as Ty Cobb  Robert Wool was okay  as the guy  Stumpy who played  the reporter  who was  again  Cobb wanted him  to write his life  and the conflict  was  Cobb wanted it  to be  baseball  it was a game  he wanted it  to be written  like the great  Ty Cobb  oh boy  I am the great  Ty Cobb  and he was trying  to dictate  how this guy  would write  his biography  but meanwhile  this guy's 
[01:46:00]  taking notes  on how awful  Ty Cobb is  what a horrible  human being  oh he's just  a racist  and he's terrible  and he's just  just rotten  and Cobb found  his notes  and there was  a big conflict  and Cobb had  no clue  what an ass  he was  he didn't care  great  oh no he knew  he just didn't  care  oh okay  I can appreciate  that  glad you said  and he's  in the hall  of fame  Ty Cobb  first guy  and Pete Rose  can't get in 
[01:46:30]  yeah  that's why  this whole thing  is ridiculous  when they ban  players from being  in the hall  let them all in  baseball's a dirty  game  always has been  stop with the  nonsense  dirty dirty  his lifetime  average was  366  not over 400  that was Ted  Williams averaged  the last person  of 400  was 406  that was my  mistake  Mike corrected me  Ted Williams  had him by a head  I can never think  of Ted Williams  anymore without  thinking of that  frozen head  yeah well let's  just hope that  he had a little 
[01:47:00]  repentance before  he died  praise his name  oh boy  Christian Jimmy  I almost used  the Lord's name  in vain when I  said  yeah you never  know when he's  going to pop up  on the show  thank God  he's here to  keep everybody  safe  oof  saving our souls  is what he's  doing  I'm looking  for Anthony's  clip  we've been  talking about  like our  top 10  favorite clips  of all time  and we might  actually try to  figure that out  somehow  maybe we put  them online  if people are  going to do  this you know  and really try  hard and you  know help us  out but this  is the Ted  Williams clip  he said well 
[01:47:30]  you know we  don't have to  freeze his  whole body  we can freeze  his head  his head  to bring him  back to life  yeah you always  think cryogenics  is this thing  where you know  they freeze your  whole body  and it's in  pristine condition  and everything  not true  for cheaper  they cut your  head off  and just freeze  your head  so in the end  you just need  your brain  and yeah  they think that  you know  if in the future  they're able to  get the essence  of who you are  out of your brain  and put it in  some kind of 
[01:48:00]  different organism  a new vessel  because no matter  what they do  with this freezing  process  it just destroys  the cells  yeah of course  of course  so  let's just deal  with it  let's just deal  with it  we're gonna have  to die someday  good luck  Ted  Ted  Ted  Ted Williams  I like to hit  the old baseball  every now and  again  unlike my  friend Jolt Joe  who likes to  hit the old  baseball  when his wife  is holding it  in her mouth  he likes to 
[01:48:30]  dip his fist  in a Mr.  Coffee  and belt  that mouthy  snot  baseball players  you know  allegedly loving  beating those  wives  of theirs  that's why  I called  him Jolting  Joe  he had a  jolter  all right  he sure  would  he'd jolter  right out of  a Demerol  dose  hit her in the  face with a  Mr. Coffee  pot  have we booked  Anthony on  Hannity yet 
[01:49:00]  we're working on it  all right let's go  what  Hannity listens  when he's  dropping his  kids off to  school  do it for next  week though  why next week  next week  you need a  haircut  yeah I just  gotta get back  into a  fighting shape  here I'm still  you know  coughing and  my throat is a  little  well you get  the topics  the way it  works  I've done  have these  give me a  little  they say  email you the  topics a little  lot before  yes good  great  yeah  more of the  stimulus package  Anthony  yeah  I'm gonna just  read some of  the stuff that  is in there 
[01:49:30]  this is  legitimate stuff  we probably  could have done  a radio bit  and had some  fun with this  but why do  that when some  of this stuff  is fun in  its own right  335 million  dollars to  control sexually  transmitted diseases  the old STDs  let me ask you  a question  and again I know  there's a lot of  democratic  how poor  but how much  and I like the  Pelosi I like the  abortion thing  and the family  planning thing  I really do  even though that's  a sacred  coward left 
[01:50:00]  I like the fact  that that will  to me save us  money  that will save  us a lot  of money  how much  do we spend  a year on  STDs  for people  you know  and in healthcare  for STDs  how much  do we spend  a year  what  I don't know  is going to be  done  about that  we do spend  a lot  we already  spend a lot  on it  what is being  done  there are  people  that  do not  they get  STDs  we need  education 
[01:50:30]  if you put  that  in there  and that's  dirty  you're going  to get  an STD  I don't  understand  like  where's all  this money  going  stay out  of the  dirt  and again  it's  an economic  stimulus plan  this shouldn't  take precedent  it should  not  it should  it should  be  something  else  down the  road  right now  economic  stimulate  the economy 
[01:51:00]  don't  care  if someone's  got the  clap  get some  jobs  out there  Jesus  unbelievable  400 million  dollars for  more  global warming  satellite  monitoring  systems  this  one of the  biggest  scams  of  this  new century  that's what  Mr. Hannity  says  it is  I don't  know what  to believe  it is a  giant  scam  this whole  going green 
[01:51:30]  thing  and our  carbon footprint  and blah  blah blah  blah blah  look at  the industry  during the  industrial revolution  we were pumping  out more  crap  than we  are now  as far as  emissions go  we're as clean  as we can be  using fossil  fuels  and  until we  get another  form of  energy  this is what  we got  should we be  working on  other stuff  sure 
[01:52:00]  but it's not  going to  happen tomorrow  so stop  putting  put more  restrictions on  things  what Obama  is planning  for the  auto industry  thank god  the auto  industry is  doing so  well  these days  because they  could really  afford to do  a state  by state  emissions  testing  and  qualifying  he wants  to kind  of put it  in the  state's  hands  like you  know  how  California  has their  own  separate  little  emissions  thing  like the  whole  country  each  state  to have  their  own 
[01:52:30]  little  standards  on  emissions  so that  what  car  manufacturers  are going  to have  to put  out  50  different  types  of  emissions  for  every  model  vehicle  that  goes  out  for  every  separate  state  or  one  which  just  covers  the  most  extreme  state  yeah  well  whatever  it is  put more  restrictions  on  the  automotive  industry  in this  day  where  they're  just  in  the  crapper  honestly  I think  the  automotive  industry  could have  probably  moved  a little  bit  faster  on doing  a lot  of this  stuff  so they  deserve  nothing 
[01:53:00]  but I  kind  of like  the fact  that if  we're  bailing  them  out  we  have  the  right  to  say  you know  what  this  is  what  you're  going  to  do  if  you  want  the  money  and  that's  how  everyone  getting  bailed  out  should  be  treated  you  want  the  money  so you  don't  go  into  the  toilet  fine  but this  is what  you're  going to  do  for it  well  I like  them being  looked at  and see  if they're  spending  the money  responsibly  if they're  buying  multi  million dollar  jets  that's a  problem  but  you can't  have the  government  telling the  auto industry 
[01:53:30]  how to  work the  auto industry  obviously  there were  problems  in  management  but  you can't  then  have the  government  be  now  they know  everything  about the  automotive  industry  and how  to  retool  a plant  to  put out  different  types  of  automobiles  it's  ridiculous  that the  government's  in everything  now  they're  in our  banking  now the  government's  bankers  they know  how to  do  banking  they're  going to  know  how to  run  the  automotive  industry  they're 
[01:54:00]  going to  know  how to  do  mortgages  it's  amazing  what the  government  is going  to get  into  they should  be monitored  by people  who know  what they're  doing  well shouldn't  these companies  not go to  the government  begging for  money then  no other  choice  I mean  it's like  with the  auto industry  the government  runs NASA  I think  there's enough  qualified people  who can  oversee it  and see  where they're  making mistakes  and where  they're being  just wasting  money  if you  then want  to appoint  somebody  that perhaps  was a 
[01:54:30]  successful  automotive  executive  to oversee  how the  automotive  industry  is  using  that  money  then  maybe  I don't  know  I might  be talking  out my  crack right  now too  but  it just  gets me  that  he's putting  a lot of  restrictions  on a business  that's  talking about  talking out  of your  crack  just an  observation  from Todd  that's pretty  good  I'm not  saying you're  one of these  because I think  you're more  knowledgeable 
[01:55:00]  go ahead  Todd  hey  Anthony  what would  you prefer  that we have  McCain and  pale in it  and talking  about someone  who's  successful  in the  business  you probably  voted for  Bush twice  when's  Bush  ever been  successful  in any  business  I did  vote for  Bush  and I  regretted it  I understood  that I had  made a mistake  but I  wasn't going  no way 
[01:55:30]  was I  voting  for  Dummy  Barack  what  no  Barack  Obama  not Barack  Barack  so you don't  even remember  his first name  anymore  Kerry  no no  who ran  against  Bush  stupid  friggin  John  Kerry  I wasn't  going to  vote for  him  he was a  disaster  too  so you  know  it was  one of  those  things  if  they  you know  what  who did  you vote  for  Bush  he said  Bush 
[01:56:00]  I said  Bush  no no  this time  around  oh this  time around  McCain  oh wow  so we can  really take  yeah  because I  didn't want  to vote  for Obama  I'm an  idiot  right  okay  a lot  of people  voted for  McCain  my friend  yeah  it wasn't  like  just about  50-50  it was  53-47  pretty much  well now  you have  this guy  as the  president  why don't  you give  him a  chance  he's only  been  in  office  less than  two weeks  do I have  to say  it again  I've listened  to his  policies  for two 
[01:56:30]  years  of a  campaign  that was  way too  god damn  long  I know  what he's  about  he's not  going to  get an office  and change  he's already  signed into  legislation  crap  crap  he signs  he signs  he signs  a bill  he signs  a bill  that gives  people  an easier  way to  sue  their  employers  for  discrimination  that's  what he  does  that's  what he  did  come on  man forget  about the  race  part  that's  what he  did  that's 
[01:57:00]  what he  did  he used  his time  his early  days  here  I'm  looking at  what he's  doing  idiot  that's  what I'm  saying  I'm not  I'm not  just talking  I looked  at what  he did  he signed  a bill  that is  going to  make it  easier  for an  employee  to sue  his employer  for discrimination  like it  isn't a piece  of cake  now that  happens  every day  and the  stimulus  package  is full  of garbage  that he  said  would never  be in  any of  his  bills  it's  also  gender 
[01:57:30]  and sexual  orientation  god almighty  Todd are you  dumb  yes you  are  because it's  not about  anthony's  saying  anything  about  Obama's  race  or the  racial  issue  so  discrimination  could be  that you  feel you  are  discriminated  against  because of  your gender  or because  of your  sexual orientation  people use  what the hell  are you talking  about  what's that  what are you  talking about  that could be  discrimination too  yeah I know  what I'm talking  about  why do you  instantly think  discrimination  is just  race  because you're  a racist  anthony is 
[01:58:00]  a liberal  racist  everybody's a  racist  come on  if you're  not a  racist  look at  the definition  of race  of race  I mean  everybody is  a racist  yeah  you know  it's not  really a  vocal term  what I'm  saying is  if you want  Americans to  succeed  I mean  give the guy  a chance  no  he's giving  him a chance  he doesn't like  his policies  I don't like  his policies  good point  good point  this is exactly  where Rush Limbaugh  fell into that  thing  where it said  at least give  him a chance  by saying  he hopes  he fails 
[01:58:30]  because  exactly  because  it sounds  like you're  echoing  it  I am  I am  because  his policies  if they  succeed  will make  this country  a place  that it's  not supposed  to be  as America  as the  country  is supposed  to be  it would be  a socialist  nation  so I do  not want  to see  that either  it doesn't  that it works  I mean  right now  people are  losing their jobs  name me a place 
[01:59:00]  name me a place  where it works  name me a country  where socialism  works  go  go  weren't you  a union  sheetrock  a sheet metal  worker  hey Todd  answer his  question  I was a sheet metal  worker  union  not union  I didn't want  to be in the union  I could care less  about the union  I went to work  and made my money  answer his  question Todd  I'm not Mr.  rah rah union  guy  answer my question  give me a socialist  give me  give me a successful  long term socialist  country  go  no I couldn't 
[01:59:30]  I couldn't  thank you  I couldn't even  tell you  exactly  it's the new  even China  even China  had to go  capitalist  even China  had to adopt  capitalism  to survive  in this day  and age  and now  we're going to  turn socialist  with Barack Obama  handing out his  welfare tax rebate  checks  so people that  don't pay taxes  giving a stimulus  package that's  full of pork  with all your money  you're going to be  walking down the street  scared  with your guns  because  there's other people  out here  are going to be  starving bro 
[02:00:00]  I mean come on  give the guy a chance  to at least  put a little bit of money  I gave him a chance  during his campaigning  you have no knowledge  of what you're talking about  and has hit you with facts  and what he doesn't like  about what this guy's signing  no no hold on  don't back him up  if you don't know  what you're talking about  I know what I'm talking about  he wouldn't back me up  if I wasn't  he's not  you're such a knee jerk  reactionary liberal  like with Rush  what exactly  what exactly  did Rush Limbaugh say  what exactly  did Rush say  no no hold on Todd 
[02:00:30]  what did Rush say  what exactly  did he say  what are you talking about  what did Rush say  you said that Anthony  just fell into  what Rush did  so you must know  what Rush said  what did he say  well he said  he hopes that  Barack Obama  failed  what was the context  in which he said that  the stimulus package  oh jeez  say  am I wrong  yes you are wrong  yeah  yes you are  then you gotta watch  the news  because you don't know  what you're talking about  I heard the quote 
[02:01:00]  not the sound bite  not the summation  given by the biased news anchor  I heard the quote  from the guy who said it  okay  then educate me  please Jimmy  I can admit  when I'm wrong  good for you  because you had  this entire discussion  oh that was a shot  of you Jimmy  no it wasn't a shot  it took a little shot  at you  explain to me  if you know so much  tell me  Rush's quote was in context  of if Obama  if his plan  is the government absorption  of all of these different things  whether it's banking 
[02:01:30]  and the auto industry  then that is socialism  and if that's his plan  then he hopes Obama fails  because he does not  let me finish  go back and watch  I'm explaining  I hope he fails  he didn't say if  he said I hope he fails  he said  I hope he fails  make sure you know  what you're talking about  I heard the quote  you dummy  I just had to tell you  what it was about  you heard a soundbite  I hope he fails  you can't always be right 
[02:02:00]  Jimmy  I like you too  I like you guys  I like you too  do we have the Rush quote  actually you're the only one  you're the one  I normally dislike  yeah I know  you're the only one  I'm turning people around  do we have the Rush quote  how can we get the Rush quote  I'm going to end up  being the one you like  I just know that now  not  no just this moment  oh all right  all right Todd  Todd you're just  ill-informed  I'm just taking your  slight compliment  I gotta go to work  I still got a job  we'll see you  all right Todd's go  what a goddamn  fuck  Todd in Jersey 
[02:02:30]  I think Hobb would  pay him a visit  but that's what you're  dealing with out there  it's like that's what  you're dealing with  someone who actually  believes the one soundbite  and he's like  oh that's what the media  said that he said  the media that just  adores Obama  would never  quote Rush  in the full context  it's crazy  you have any  Danny  I think I have  we gotta take a break  hurry up with the  thing there  you want it  yeah go go go  if I wanted Obama 
[02:03:00]  to succeed  I'd be happy  the Republicans  have laid down  and I would be  encouraging Republicans  to lay down  and support him  I don't want  look what he's  talking about  is the  is the absorption  of as much  of the private sector  by the US government  as possible  from the banking  business  the mortgage industry  to the automobile  business  to the health care  I do not want  the government  in charge of  all of these things  I don't want  this to work  so I'm thinking 
[02:03:30]  of replying to the  guys okay  I'll send you  a response  but I don't need  400 words  I need four  I hope  he fails  well what are you  laughing at  see here's the  point  everybody thinks  it's outrageous  to say  look at even  my staff  oh you can't  do that  why not  what  why  why is it  any different  what's new  what is  what is unfair  about my saying  I hope liberalism 
[02:04:00]  fails  liberalism  is our  problem  liberalism  is what's  gotten us  dangerously  close to  the precipice  here  why do I  want more  of it  that's the  context  whether you  agree with  it or not  that's the  context  of it  I put the  word if  in there  in summation  he say  okay Obama  wants the  absorption  of all  these things  by the  government  the government  running  all these  things  he wants  these things  I want  him to  fail  because I  don't want  the government  running  everything  so that's 
[02:04:30]  what Rush  Limbaugh  said  and then  explained  after he  was talking  overall  about  liberalism  in general  but a  dumbbell  like Todd  hears the  media  just  isolate  I hope  he fails  and they  think that  he's going  well the  first black  president  I hope  he fails  it's just  a bunch  of dumbbells  who just  believe the  one soundbite  they hear  and the  in love  media  the media  that is  just in  lust  with  with Barry  oh are they  in lust  with  this guy 
[02:05:00]  Barack  Barry  Hussein  Barack  Obama  whatever  you want  to call  him  he's writing  love letters  to Iran  Todd  it said  on the screen  by the way  that Todd  he made a good  point that  everyone's becoming  a mini politician  because of  everything that's  going on in this  country  but Todd  he's stupid  because everyone's  a mini politician  when they vote  everyone's making  a decision  on what the country  is going to do  it's a little  more than usual  is what I'm saying  Barack Obama  has got a lot  of people  interested in politics  that never had  an interest  I'll give him 
[02:05:30]  that  that's true  a lot of people  talking about it  we're just going to  end up strangling  ourselves  this country's just  going to strangle  itself  all in the streets  just choking  each other  it's just going to  be a choke  fest  until it's no  longer a country  a little mopping up  next  heading toward  music marathon time  who's not excited  out there  much better than  talking about  politics  right  you're about  the lead  did you hear  the lead  yesterday  lead lunch  or something  they do now  lunch  yesterday  we'll figure out 
[02:06:00]  what they're  doing today  after the break  Opie and Anthony  we got to go over  to the other joint  Opie and Anthony  the other jernt  well we accomplished  a lot today  I think  a lot of people  out there  changed their  opinion on things  that always happens  that's one thing  you can be sure of  God bless you guys  for your passion  but  no matter how much  passion anyone has  for anything  you're never changing  someone's mind  that has an equal  amount of passion  and they're the only 
[02:06:30]  people that will  really argue with  I like Republicans  and Democrats  that's my new stance  I like everybody  you're cuddly  with your feet  on old boobs  wow that was nice  I mean weird  it's music marathon time  now look  Billy Powell died  keyboardist for  Leonard Skinner  they're down to one guy  oh you aren't  assuming or thinking  they have to be  starting with some  Skinner right there  Danny  what's the big song  they're going to  start the music marathon  off with  well the big song

[02:08:30]  moans out there  come on that's  a cool Skinner  song  Denver Pest  was actually  saying the same  one  I'm not sure  but I think  this is quickly  becoming my  favorite Skinner  song of all  time  I don't know  that song  it has just  a nice groove  man  I'll walk  out to that  I mean  no I'm going  to sit here  and listen  to the whole  damn thing  I mean on  stage  the people  are like  hey Jim  February 5th  through 8  here at  Caroline's  you want  to walk  out to that  song  I would do  it  but only out  of respect  for the death  of Powell  of Powell  Caroline's  not important

[02:09:30]  O.P. and Anthony  show  having a good  one today  hello  hello  I had more  on the  stimulus package  but I left  my notes  over at the  other joint  stimulus package  how about a  few billion  to that  organization  that community  activist organization  that got them  elected  Acorn  that's nice  isn't that  isn't that  sweet  give back  that's nice  I like that one  that's nice  the one that  really bothers me  I'm happy  not that anyone's 
[02:10:00]  asking but  the Amtrak thing  hasn't turned a  profit in 40 years  and they get  thrown another  billion dollars  at that company  that's just a  disaster  always has been  they suck  a billion more  dollars to keep  Amtrak afloat  the thing is  why are they  turning a profit  that's what I  question  seems like  every time we  go to Washington  or Philly  I do a lot of  Philly trips on  Amtrak now  and the Accela  and then  that fucking  train is packed  every single time  they take it out  on a run 
[02:10:30]  that's true  so why  yeah what the  hell is that  that's when I  start  that's what I  ask  sell it to the  private sector  yeah  well it was  privately owned  for a while  wasn't it  I wouldn't know  what was it  Amtrak  I think it was  I think the  government took  it over  and lost  more money  yeah it's just  air travel kind  of ruined the  railroad but  you know  and why don't we  have those  really fast trains  like they're doing  in New York  the bullet trains  because we'd have  to replace all  the fucking tracks  alright there's  your jobs  let's go  yeah there's a  nice jobs package 
[02:11:00]  replace every  fucking railroad  track in the  country please  with one that's  painted green  and made of gold  that's the  stimulus package  it will get  the gold market  going  we're  stimulus  stimulus  stimulus  sounds like  the way some  prude like  diddles a clit  I'm going to  stimulus you  here's some  stimulus  and they diddle it  with that one  coke nail on  their pinky  they didn't even  want to touch  the fleshy orb  where's my notes 
[02:11:30]  on the stimulus  we did the  billion dollars  on the Amtrak  and there was a  couple  oh government  cars  they spend  3.5 billion  on government  cars and the  stimulus package  is going to  bring that  number up  to 6 billion  wow  but will that  cut down on  flights though  will that  cut down on  flights  we'll get the  auto industry  up  what car  gets that  bid  Ford  going backwards  a little bit  a lot of people  are digging the  fact we played  give me back  my bullet  by Skinner  and Rob G  from New York  City  I must thank you  I mostly listen

[02:15:00]  praise his name  oh well  Christian Jimmy  where's the music  though  we got the wrong  guy up in the  seat  no offense  but  oh fuck  that's a backhanded  insult  no offense  but we do  I mean it ran  smoothly  yeah  we were on it  why don't we just  why don't you just  make an executive  decision saying  hey Derek  get in there  not butcher  get out  is our executive  intern in today  get out  get out  I didn't see him  oh my god  Sam was telling me  a story after the show  yesterday  Sam in here 
[02:15:30]  for a quick one  as we get Sam  Nick has some  info on  give me back  my bullet  listen to this  horse shit  I heard this  Nick in Georgia  you're not the  horse shit portion  of the  listen to this  horse shit  by the way  you're just  you're just  bringing the  knowledge  he doesn't like  Nick  Nick  yes  go ahead Nick  listen Jimmy  don't use that  song  give me back  my bullet  because  Leonard Skinner's  day  that song  was about  a song  rocketing  to the top 
[02:16:00]  of the charts  that is such  give me back  my bullet  and they had  problems with  they couldn't  play it in  concert  because  their audience  go figure  the rocket  scientists  that they were  would shower  the stage  with bullets  throw bullets  on the stage  all this is true  by the way  but Skinner  was talking  about  bang bang  yes  they weren't  talking about  that chart  topping  crap  whatever the  case may be  I just  whatever excuse  they came up  with to try  to get people  to stop  throwing bullets  on the stage  but the problem 
[02:16:30]  is it's one  of the coolest  Skinner songs  and they just  couldn't play it  in concert  this guy's right  because their  fans would  throw bullets  yeah  live ammo  I got a good  joke  they should have  changed the  name of it  to give me  back my dollars  praise his name  oh fuck  Chris and Jimmy  just brings a  halt  a grinding  halt  to funny  well if I was  with my real  friends I'd say  they should just  come up and say  give me back  my bibles  let them rain  down on us 
[02:17:00]  thank you  but that is a  true story  but they were  definitely  talking about  bullets  they're from the  south  shut up  whatever they had  to do to get  the song on  radio I guess  Sam  where is our  executive intern  and what was  Saturday night  special about  just a Saturday  night special  some restaurant  got a barrel  that's blue  and cold  ain't good  for nothing  put a man 
[02:17:30]  six feet  in a hole  that might be  my favorite  Skinner song  I forgot about  that one  because that was  part of the  laser light show  in Huntington  yeah here we go  and you'll see  I sang it  exactly like  you know what  fuck all y'all  it's our channel  now we're playing  this whole song  this reminds me  of my favorite song  oh what's your  favorite one  if he can wash  the feet of a  leper  then why can't  I do that  why can't I  do that  you wash the 
[02:18:00]  ass of a  leper  with your tongue  my bible  says Adam  and Eve  not Adam  and Steve  ah  that's  something  you could  talk about  there  Christian  Jimmy  gay marriage  thing  against it  right  I sure am  yeah  it's not  his way  it's not  his way  southern rock 
[02:18:30]  is such a weird  almost crossover  from country  thing  but it was  nah  nah  nah  nah  nah  it was  there were people  that liked  fucking southern rock  yeah  and people that  fucking hated  southern rock  but they were both  into rock  it's an insult to  Skinner though  you know  if you  they were doing  their own thing  other people were  labeling it  southern rock  but if you were into  like Skinner  don't say 38 special  no no no  I'm not gonna go there  I'm not gonna go there  but I will go  Charlie Daniels  Charlie Daniels 
[02:19:00]  is what you're talking  about  where it's a country rock  thing  and then once it  started real  yeah well that was  a country rock  right  but it was in the  same category  I know  you put  this in the same  category  and even  Molly Hatchet  Molly Hatchet  was kind of like  the  but that's  that's the problem  the Johnny come lately  of the southern rock  but that's the problem  with the whole  southern rock  Allman Brothers  it was more of a  yeah  but they were doing  their own thing too  you can't throw the  southern rock label  on Skinner  or the Allman Brothers  yeah 
[02:19:30]  I just can't  I think it was more  Molly Hatchet  38 special  Charlie Daniels band  they were like  those people  they were southern rock  guys  then they were like  glitter rock  and glam rock  faggots  Striker was very good  Striper  oh  that was the  Christian rock band  wait hey  what were you  talking about  you should know  Christian Jimmy  Striker  I interrupted you  though  you said  you really liked  oh I was really  into southern rock  like 
[02:20:00]  but  so  but there were  other guys  that were into  like  if you were into  like  glam rock  Bowie  and all that shit  or regular rock  like Stones  and stuff  that was a whole  different crowd  yeah but  who were some  of the  glam rock bands  I mean you had  Bowie  and then what  Bowie  and then  and then they  were like  for real  I don't know  I couldn't name them  they overused  that term too  glam rock  but there were  a few of them  like who  punk was another  thing  right  like if you're  into that  because that was 
[02:20:30]  coming around  at that time  there were a lot  of different  factions of  of rock  back then  and  you didn't beat  the shit out  of each other  over it  but you definitely  didn't want to  hear it  was Kiss  considered glam rock  at all  I think at the  time they kind  of were  because of the  makeup and shit  they were heavier  than like a Bowie  or another glam rock  they didn't fit into  like metal  at the time  either  because metal  was kind of  different back then  metal was like  fucking Sabbath  E-Rock just told me  that Steve knows  glam rock  well  of course you do 
[02:21:00]  I'm talking  old school glam  old school  like New York  dolls  yeah okay  New York  dolls  overrated  oh no shit  overrated  that's like glam rock  wasn't  Iggy  Iggy Pop  Iggy Pop  is a punk  right  he was punk  I'm gonna piss off  music fans  New York dolls  overrated  Stooges  overrated  what about  Captain Beefheart  way overrated  what about  what's his name  Bolin  T-Rex  is that  considered glam  bang a gong  move on  that's all  pedophile 
[02:21:30]  Gary Glitter  Gary Glitter  way overrated  one fucking  underrated  there's a person  though  drive-by truckers  is a band  that a lot  more people  should know  yes  AW from  Jersey  you know  who's a big  fan of  drive-by truckers  a little  author named  Stephen King  really  I read his  fucking column  all the time  on Entertainment  Weekly  we can't get  this guy on  the phone  I love his  pop culture  angle  he loves  drive-by truckers 
[02:22:00]  I paid  fucking money  on an auction  site to go  see him read  live  and got a  book sign  right  I got books  on and  everything  I got a  lot of  who's got  the book  oh shit  did you lose  the book  I might have  lost the books  did you meet  them  no they were  presents  they were  Christmas presents  anyway  no I wanted  to and I  think I could  have swung it  because it  was the same  publisher as  the whole  Viacom  conglomerate at  the time  but didn't  do it fast 
[02:22:30]  enough  it was kind  of a last  minute thing  but I  have a lot  of I  had a lot  of first  issue  it was the  first printing  wow  of Stephen  King books  some of them  signed  how'd you get  them signed  they were  signed  just signed  I bought  them signed  with just  his name  signed  and it was  all certified  obviously I  knew it was  him  he's got the  certificate and  a picture and  everything like  that  but first  printing of 
[02:23:00]  like Cujo  and  how much  was that  one  I don't  know  they ran  into the  hundreds  some of  them  they were  really rare  to get  a first  printing  of them  but  I don't  have those  anymore  so we gotta  get you  another one  man  no because  I wasn't  into it  it was  pretty much  Melinda  that was  really into  Stephen King  I'm into  him  birthday and  Christmas  and stuff  I don't  know  the fucking  first edition  it signed  get to  it  mmm  yeah  how about  you guys  hop to that  I think I  had that  my favorite  book  let's get 
[02:23:30]  that  let's get  you a  Stephen King  autograph  let's do  that  I think I  got one  at the  house  somewhere  I don't  have a  drive-by  trucker song  for the  masses  so  because a  lot of  people are  like you  right on  with the  drive-by  truckers  thing  and  Fast  Friday  of course  Stooge  is overrated  you're such  a musical  retard  I'm sorry  that's my  opinion  it is  you know  Stooges  all right  great  wonderful 
[02:24:00]  couple good  songs  yeah  I got a  couple on  my iPod  not that I'm  using my  iPod a lot  these days  sure  well if you  had an  iPhone  see then  it's your  iPod  and your  phone  and your  iPod  because it  doesn't work  as a  phone  but can I  can I  present  something  I found  I found  something  I didn't  want to say  that I had  it with  me  you got  it  I don't  want to  say it  give it  to him  I can  part with  this  look  he's giving 
[02:24:30]  it to you  I can't  believe he's  actually doing  this  yeah  wow  it's a  Stephen King  autograph  on a piece of  paper that's been  sitting in front of  Jimmy  written  I don't  I don't  remember his  autograph  looking like  this though  he sees a  little crown  over the  eye  yes  he puts a  little crown  over that  and by the  way  he misspelled  his first name  which he  spells with a  ph and not a  v  he does that  because he  doesn't want  people to  know it's  really him  he's shy  I should have 
[02:25:00]  signed it  Richie  Bachman  hey it's more  of a visual  oh wait a minute  quickly we were  just talking about  cell phones so  this popped in my  head  last night after  Lost  that horrible  show  Life on Mars  about the  70s  that's still  happening  you're still  watching it  I thought you  gave up on that  I did  completely  that's why I  only have one  example that  happened before I  grabbed the 
[02:25:30]  remote to  change the  channel from  Lost ending  to something  else  you got caught  I got caught  and there was  a guy that was  going to jump  off a building  commit suicide  so all the  70s cops are  down there  and it's like  yeah we got a  suicide  this guy  his wife left  him and  he was screwed  over with a  business proposition  yeah supposedly  he had an idea  for a phone  that you carry  with you  and then they  were like  who wants to  carry a phone 
[02:26:00]  with you  that's fucking  I'm embarrassed  and I was  sitting there  going  why is this  show still  on TV  I'm just like  what the fuck  first of all  if you're a cop  of course you'd  want a phone  with you  any person  would  yes  why  and they  not only  said it  once  they did  it twice  the why  would you  want to  carry a  phone  with you  and then  the guy  that's  from the  future  has to  say  he gets  into  a bullhorn  and tells  the guy  sir  don't worry  he goes  someday  everyone  will carry 
[02:26:30]  these phones  around  with them  we didn't  know that  shut it  we didn't  know that  back then  first of all  doc brown  would fucking  whack him in the  head for telling  people about  the future  you can't tell  anyone about  the future  of course you  can bring  people back  you can build  trains and bring  them to the future  you can do all  kinds of things  doc brown did  but you can't  fucking  it'll fuck up  the future  if you do  anything  it'll cause  a chain  reaction  yes  and you  could end  up skewing  into a  alternative  timeline  but he  was one  of the  biggest  fucking  instigators 
[02:27:00]  of fucking  with shit  in the past  right  I'm gonna  stay here  I'm staying  Marty  Marty  I'm gonna  stay  no you  can't  fucking  stay  idiot  but he  kept it  under wraps  he just  kind of  went in  and like  take a hoverboard  Marty  when Marty  went to see  his family  stay  like his  future self  yes  he stayed  in the  closet  nobody  saw him  it was  ridiculous  he chastised  everybody  for fucking  doing that  you just gotta  be very  secretive  and detective  work about  horrible  bastard  I was reading 
[02:27:30]  something online  somebody had  written like  a blog  or like  an article  about what  an asshole  Marty McFly  was  for not  giving himself  more time  to save  doc  yeah  he's like  ten minutes  you give me  ten minutes  I can't  remember the  whole thing  but the  article  concluded  with  thanks for  watching me  get shot  twice  asshole  come on  it's great  back to the  future  when does  the new  box deck  come out  oh I've  been getting  many facebook  messages 
[02:28:00]  from the guy  that runs  bttf.com  talking about  you know  that guy  well I guess  I've subscribed  to his feed  or whatever  holy shit  you're starstruck  by that  fucking asshole  dude  I have  much information  in my  inbox  here  I gotta  know  when that  comes out  it's not  a box set  isn't it  single releases  of each  movie  February 10th  what  so it's a  two disc set  of back to the future  part 1  they've never been  released before  as single  editions  it's only been the box set  only the box set  that's why this is such  an exciting release  oh ok 
[02:28:30]  alright  and then what  when is  what is the  ride  which disc is that  going to be on  it's disc 2  of back to the future  part 1  oh ok  but this is my  all I've ever wanted  is just to own  part 3  help me  just part 3  yeah that's all  I want to own  help me  you're stupid  part 3 stinks  I gotta tell you  what's going on here  what  everyone's screaming  for me to play  the phone static  I don't have it  on this side  so I'm fucked  I gotta sit here  you can play  the phone static 
[02:29:00]  yeah  well I'm looking  forward to that  and like the box  art looks like  the poster  I'll try that  one of the  I'm looking at  the bonus features  for back to the  future 3  the disc eraser  I'm hoping this is  a mistake  or a typo  because it just says  deleted scene  scene  should have been  the whole movie  it's the scene  where they explain  those glowing logs  that he got  it's the scene  where the director  breaks the fourth wall 
[02:29:30]  and apologizes  to the audience  for the heap of shit  he's pushing through  that stunk  one good scene  or mad dog  yeah  thank you  wouldn't it be a funny  one if they went  to the future  and Marty McFly  was shaking  like the dickens  and like oh  nobody will believe  this  you're a paint shaker  Marty  you're the martini  making champion  of the world  you've inspired me  to build a paint shaker  Marty  that's funny  your wrists are  scalded  from hot soup 
[02:30:00]  spillage  when I was driving  home yesterday  Marty you're an egg  beater  you broke all  ten fingers  trying to hang  a picture  Marty  you've thrown  your baby down  47 times  yes Danny  I was driving  home yesterday  trying to have  a really good idea  for something  because I had hit  my head  and I had a mark  much like  much like  Doc Brown  when Doc hit his head 
[02:30:30]  on the force  capacitor  so I was just  trying to think  of something  really smart  but it never came  do you know  what this means  what does it  mean Sam  this thing  doesn't work  of course  he had it  on his head  and he had  the plunger  on Marty's  yeah  that was fantastic  yeah  good times  good times  oh my god  I'm looking at  are they playing  something else  besides our show  right now  because I'm looking  at Pal Talk 
[02:31:00]  and people hate  what they're hearing  I don't understand it  is there a glitch  that maybe we went  off the air  and they're playing  emergency testing  a bit  or a  yeah  Marty  it's the craziest  thing I saw  in the future  you cut off  circulation  to your ankle  trying to tie  your shoes  Marty  you have to go  back to the future  I need a milkshake  poor guy 
[02:31:30]  and cut  you fucked up  the shock absorbers  and the delirious  shaking so much  Marty  Marty you gotta  you gotta go  back to the future  you shook the bill  off your meds hat  don't pop the clutch  so fast  oh that's you  and the scene 
[02:32:00]  scene  nice  Marty you have to  go back  to the future  people  would put dice  on your head  and yell  boggle  the power of love  and the scene  Huey Lewis  and the news  Marty you have to  go back to the future  every time you play 
[02:32:30]  goldfish  it becomes  52 pick up  I never ripped up  that note Marty  you handed it to me  in the future  you have to go back  to the future  Marty  your signature  looks like a heart monitor 
[02:33:00]  scene  Marty you have to  come back  with me to the future  it's your kids  Marty  your kids  they have  shaken baby syndrome  Marty you have to 
[02:33:30]  come to the future  every time you  hug somebody  they think you're  dancing with them  oh boy  and  scene  there you go 
[02:34:00]  I don't believe you  that was the scene  that's right  can't think of anything  else  it shakes  really  that's right  you know  shakes  shakes  yeah a lot  apparently  from what I've  seen of him  that's very shaky  indeed  Sam was telling me  that they're  fucking with  intern David  but he's not here today  no he's not here  he's in Monday  Wednesday  Friday  so tomorrow  that's why there's  so much chaos 
[02:34:30]  on the sabbath  they gave him a title  as what  well Kenny  he's got two titles  Kenny gave him two titles  Kenny and I  named him  executive intern  because  he must have  really loved that  which he's taking  very seriously  yeah  I mean  for real  he's pushing around  the other interns  do you have an example  of him using his power  our one intern  Paul who is actually  the only intern  we've ever had  that has some kind  of go-getter attitude 
[02:35:00]  and is actually  taking a lead on things  was telling him  what to do  he said  you have to go  staple those papers  who is that one  he's a tall guy  hippie guy  yeah he looks like  Aaron Brockovich's boyfriend  that's an Eastside Dave  observation  wow  that is a little obscure  yeah  but I like that kid  he does seem like  a go-getter  he's good  but David  David looked at him  and goes  no no no  you don't tell me  what to do  I'm the executive intern  oh  so he knows 
[02:35:30]  that he's in charge  furthermore  I gave him  the additional title  of uh  office manager  yeah  so he's in charge  he's  it's not  he's  he knows what's going on  of all office supplies  it's working  the guy plays along  what's he doing  is he playing along  yes  what do you know  we point  the intern goes to the mic  he knows  do you know  alright  get the fuck out of here  scram 
[02:36:00]  it's like  when we get interns  we can fuck with more  yeah  you gotta get the new guys  well tomorrow  when he comes in  now that we've all set this up  yeah  we can talk to him  about his new title  and his new power  as executive  he went home  and told his parents  that he's been promoted  to executive intern  oh god  and he started a facebook page  and his job title  is executive intern  slash  xm office manager  office manager 
[02:36:30]  can you get him  office manager too  right  that's kind of good  he's in charge of all  office supplies  in charge of knowing  where they are  you know that is now  absolutely on his resume  he rules  you know that  executive intern  and office manager  and then what skills  he needed for that  and what his duties were  as office manager  he was going around  to every staff member  seeing what supplies  they needed  making a list  going to the staples website  i don't know why  because he wasn't ordering  them or anything like that  he just saw that they  existed  would he want to see  pictures of it  and hang them up 
[02:37:00]  he said okay blue pens  okay they exist  he is great  he's the best  and then he went to mars  and said here's the supplies  we need  and gave him the chicken  scratch handwriting  it was like  yeah his awful handwriting  seven boxes of red sharpies  go fetch these  you PR  it's nice  he's here to read a Torah  we gotta talk to him  about this tomorrow  Paul the intern's on the phone  to talk about intern date  Paul  hey what's going on guys  hey  you know every morning  he tells me  different directions  you know  we come in  we set up the studio 
[02:37:30]  whatever  and he tells me something  you know  different papers go here  different papers go there  but the problem with David  and I do love the kid to death  is that he  repeats the same directions  87 times  while you're doing the task  he's repeating the direction  while you're doing  what he just said  but he is executive intern  so you have to listen  yeah  he's allowed  of course  you know  without his leadership  I don't know what the hell  I would do  well yeah  Paul also told me  I'm constantly reprimanding David  for being late 
[02:38:00]  because he's late every single day  David's late?  he's supposed to be in at 4.30  he's the executive intern  exactly  he never is  so Paul asked him one time  or it was this week  he goes  David why are you late?  and David goes  no no  I don't come in at 4.30  and Paul goes  no we're all supposed to come in at 4.30  and David goes  no no no  I come in at 5  because he's the executive  because he can  because he made up his own time  no but he didn't ask  nobody said that  that was something  he made up in his head 
[02:38:30]  and said  now I come in at 4.30  and what was the Facebook story  he's got two friends  or something  oh yes  well we met a young lady  at Hooters  who got him drunk  yeah  last Friday  they got David drunk  or a couple friends  wow  that must have taken like  a beer  yes  he came back here  when I told him to learn  how to cut audio  from Paul  and while Paul was teaching  him how to cut audio  David promptly passed out  in the chair  in the office  he  I've seen him drunk  a couple of times  is he good  wow  he was hammered  at the  well that was my 
[02:39:00]  my whole plan  was at the Halloween party  just to get David  ridiculously drunk  and I was  I was feeding him  like Maker's Mark  mission accomplished  yeah he was dancing  on stage  I don't know  and he was  he was dancing  on stage  asking the DJ  to play some  house and hip hop music  so he could dance  but this is the type of guy  David goes  no no  I don't want to learn  how to cut audio  he's the only  he goes  I don't want to learn  how to do that  and I go  what do you want  to learn how to do  and he goes  you know  how to like  talk on air 
[02:39:30]  and stuff  and I was like  you're just here  to get on air  and he's like  yeah  yeah  but did he try  to befriend  someone at Hooters  and  yes  our waitress  oh no  who  hip hop Ron  and David  convinced  to give us  her last name  so we could look her  up on Facebook  even though David  doesn't have a Facebook  and then I told David  if he wanted to charm her  ask her if he could  take a picture with her  ah  so I took a picture  of the two of them  and then Monday  we set up a Facebook page  for David  with his only picture  is a picture of him  and this waitress 
[02:40:00]  his only friends  on Facebook  are me and Ron  who he was with  at Hooters  and then he went  and found this waitress  and Facebook  friended her  do you guys run  his Facebook site  I do  I mean he does  he can get in there  but I set it up for him  he had to change  a lot of his options  he's going to be  a social butterfly  now on that thing  oh yeah  he's already  leaving messages  on my wall  saying  as if they're private  saying  Sam  two people  just friended me  who I don't know 
[02:40:30]  but they're friends  with you and Anthony  should I accept them  as if they're private  yes  everyone can see them  and he says  what an idiot  he leaves me a message  saying  Sam  the waitress  accepted my friendship  but hip hop Ron  didn't  that's so rude  why would Ron  do that  Sam  it's very public  yeah  I can't wait  to talk to him  about his responsibilities  tomorrow  as executive intern  right  he'll be on his game  tomorrow  alright good 
[02:41:00]  alright Sam  thank you  as if he isn't always  of course  he's executive  yeah  alright  we'll take a quick break  continue  Marty you have to go  back to the future  every time you  videotape something  it absolutely looks  like the Blair Witch Project  ha ha ha ha  ha ha ha  ha ha  and scene  I hope he spilt  his yogurt  and fucking  he spilled my yogurt  you spilled the yogurt  you fucking bitch 
[02:41:30]  alright breaky time  breaky breaky  and  go  scene  alright  we were at  Oprah  55 years old  today  55  just finding the  excuse  because Oprah's  talking about  Kate Winslet's  boobs  and gets really  into it  you want to hear this  you think she  goes that way  let's  you know  I'm going to take 
[02:42:00]  a guess  let's just kind of  take a guess on that one  let's just make  believe like the rest  of America  please  alrighty  we've got a good  friend over there  alright  we don't want to  put him in a  bad spot  uh  Oprah talking about  Kate Winslet's  boobs  here it is  and  immortal  good morning  good morning  to ya  good morning  oh  oops  wrong take  wow that sounds  like  oops  I didn't need to 
[02:42:30]  play that  that sounds like  something a little  older  yeah that's  weird  wait a minute  what was that  wait a minute  I think I have to  at least hear that  part again  what are you talking  about  I got the Oprah thing  I have to hear the  beginning of that clip  one more time  please  oh no  just the beginning  part of it again  oh no  what is it  what are you talking  about  I have to  there was a miscue  I got the actual  Oprah audio now  for everybody  but I think that  I think that  I can't be  blindsided like  oh no  what is it  what is it  I just want to  hear that part  is it 
[02:43:00]  is it yet  another  horrific bit  that we've done  from the past  what are you talking  about  I got the Oprah  audio  I don't know  I don't know  what Dillette's  doing today  they're mistaken  to let me hear  that again  because I think  just the beginning  of it again  I'm not 100%  sure what that was  oh no  is this another  one of our old  and then  immortal  good morning  good morning  to ya  good morning  feels like 
[02:43:30]  we were just  on the radio  oh wow  shut up  oh wow  shut up  what um  what  was that about  they were so  much better  oh my god  blind cc 
[02:44:00]  blind cc  blind cc  wait  what was that about  what was everybody  making that noise for  between shows  Iraq might have  told me  and I certainly  did not tell  Anthony  because this  really bothers him  oh I guess  I get the cringy  douchey chills  ahead of time  we certainly  wouldn't be  playing this  you would talk  me out of it  I get the douchey  chills  but Iraq  I guess  an old  old listener  gave him  some VHS tapes  the guy used to  record our show  on VHS tapes  ah great 
[02:44:30]  well we need  more old  O&A shows  and Iraq  where is he  I'd love to hear  some of that  I'm trying to get  rid of this  like Lucas  is trying to  get rid of  the Christmas  special  I'm trying to  get rid of  any inkling  that our  AF tapes  ever existed  what's that  somebody was  nice enough  to send me  over  yeah of course  over four hours  of material  oh fuck  but  it's already  cut down  so the music  and everything  else has gone 
[02:45:00]  from it  so this could  be days  and days  of material  on these  four hours  so wait  now  Iraq  so it's not music  it's four hours  of like fucking  it's non-stop  talk breaks  is this their  TV show  no  no  this is their  he used to just  plug the audio  into a VHS tape  and run it on  slow speed  so he could get  the whole show  on one tape  when he was away  one show  you get a whole month  you were allowed  to talk maybe  ten minutes  an hour  if that  so what was that 
[02:45:30]  we just had the radio  I couldn't make it  well  actually this is our  Saturday morning show  I wasn't aware  you guys did  Saturday mornings  yeah we were forced  to do Saturdays  we were forced  to do six days a week  and then during  the off ratings books  which was the  winter book  and the summer book  we were able to do  every other Saturday  which was so nice  of Bruce  yes good old Brucey  we had to work  six days a week  I know people out there  but when you're doing radio  and you're carrying 
[02:46:00]  the fucking station  we didn't know  we'd be doing Saturdays  and the morning guy  gets every weekend off  and he's still rotting  in Worcester  but you know  but yeah  the sounds you were hearing  by the way  were bastardized versions  of our names  that had happened  over the years  it had started out  hey old  we were only working together  like a year  all right  over the weeks  over the weeks  we had bastardized  our names  you know how like 
[02:46:30]  if you're hanging out  and you say something  a lot  it sort of takes on  a different sound  after a while  so  Opie just turned into  like it was like  hey  and Anthony was like  and that was  is explaining it worse  making it worse  it's actually helping  a little bit  so I don't know  I don't know  where that comes from  I would hear like  and I'd be like  why do you guys say that  so this is interesting  to actually hear the bit  all right 
[02:47:00]  I ended up  I ended up  naming my corporation  after that  you certainly did  and when I have to tell people  well what's the name  of your company  I'm like  how do you spell that  that's true  my company's named that  yeah  I have to look at it  to tell you how  it's even spelled  it drives everyone  nuts out there  what the fuck  is he doing  what does this mean  why couldn't you get  an easy name  ah yes  anything else  to add to this 
[02:47:30]  um yeah  Anthony is recovering  from the Rush concert  he went to  the previous night  I went to Rush  and you're going again  that Saturday night  as well  I don't even  fucking remember  going to see Rush  I saw Rush  up there  I mean  let me think  wow  your brother's there  with you too  what  he came off  from New York  to go to the Rush show  it's a total  fucking amnesia  I have no recollection  it's called  merciful amnesia

[02:52:00]  the rock twice an hour  is what they said  for commercials  and there was no music  bed under the commercials  so even though  we took breaks  people would say  hey dude  you're taking breaks  so the rock stops  more than twice an hour  but  technically  no it didn't  that's right  because the music  was playing underneath  what we were saying  we're still rocking  we're rocking  so the rock  should have been  taken  with a very firm hand  and bludgeoned  over our head  just bludgeoned us

[02:59:00]  I think five's better than four  but  Iraq knows  let's go to five  if I wasn't me  I would want to hear it  when are you gonna do your song man  another man for everybody  man dude bro  wait wait  when am I gonna do my song  is this a song  this is an original  parody  but  holy shit  okay  now I gotta leave  I'm getting hot  why  like I'm getting  from complete and utter embarrassment 
[02:59:30]  Jimmy  oh no  well maybe we should do track four then  with the plumber and a vibrator  that you happen to bring home  wow  what's the  oh  oh is that the one that was left on the table  mm-hmm  I had an embarrassing moment yesterday man  you did  yeah  and it's because of one of our faithful listeners  that actually sent us  a gift  oh  the silver bullets  yeah  somebody was very nice  we get a lot of gifts here on the Opie and Anthony show  and we appreciate them  it's a silver bullet we got  from some  some girl sent it  yeah  it's basically a 
[03:00:00]  a tiny little vibrator that you stick in places  it looks like a little silver egg  yeah  and it's connected to a remote control  and it vibrates like the devil  and I don't know where you're supposed to put it  or what the hell you're supposed to do with it  but I ain't using it  okay  so I bring it home  the other night  after we're done here  like everything else  and throw it on the kitchen table  with all my other junk  and I left it there  the next day  a couple of burly plumbers  come over to snake my bathtub  I let him in  and they look at the table 
[03:00:30]  and then walk into the bathroom  with the snake  oh it's crazy  it's insane  it's like a three company episode already  what madness you lived with  so the plumbers  may have seen this little silver egg  that you can't even tell  with a wire on the table  and thought what  I'm sticking it in my asshole  but they were burly  they were burly  well don't ruin the story  why does it get better  oh is that what I say  it could only 
[03:01:00]  fuck  and then walk into the bathroom  to snake the drain  so now you think  now I'm thinking  jeez  now they see this  they think  I'm sticking this thing  where the sun don't shine  why would I have a merry little  yeah  I want to hear  Anthony's  description of what his asshole is  stick that where the sun don't shine you  so it's the Opie and Mae West show  also  why would  they think  I'm using it 
[03:01:30]  and not your wife  yeah  I don't know  was that the portion  of our lives on the radio  where we made believe  we didn't have girlfriends  yeah  yeah  cause that made us look  even cooler  and it was  it was pretty much  because  well we want our core listeners  to think like  we're not settled down  and we're wild guys  but meanwhile  it was just  please give me something else  to fuck  the official story was  you know  the guys at the station  don't want us to say  we're married  because they want us  the audience to think 
[03:02:00]  we're just you know  young guys  fucking hanging out  going to parties  and meanwhile  it was like  I didn't want people  to think I was married  because  I wanted to  oh  foot  suck face with  Kahlua girl  foot  oh yes  one of Ant's old band  uh members  foot  hey foot  we haven't heard from you in a while  that net life  that you stole from me  bitch court  bitch court  no but the thing is  I was listening to you  through the invitation  right  I'm like  oh god  I used to do this  horrible bit 
[03:02:30]  when I was starting  to do stand up  and that's the freaking bitch  yeah  I remember  when I did it  I'm like  oh shit  I'm stealing foot spit  funny  yeah don't worry  I'm not using it  yeah I can't believe  you were calling  tell everyone that  oh by the way  I heard the show yesterday  I look lovely in a dress  yes  when you were playing  with a rot gut  in your mom's dress  it was gorgeous  of course  very sexy  you gotta get your ass in here  footy  I'll be in in a couple of weeks 
[03:03:00]  alright man  hey  a quick plug  if anybody would like to come  and see the new material  I have  I will be at  Wisecrackers Scranton  tomorrow and Saturday  so if you're at Scranton  get your ass on down there  Wisecrackers and Scranton  Joseph Curry  my good friend  Plankfoot  I'll talk to you guys later  alright  bye footy  bye  bye bye  that's my pal  I'm sticking this thing  where the sun don't shine  and having a merry little time with it  and leaving it on the kitchen table  you should have gave it to him  to snake out your  it probably would have worked 
[03:03:30]  yeah  it probably would have worked  and then I'm thinking  you know you go through this thing  where it's like  well did they see it  right  now if they saw it  and I move it  it's gonna look like  ah see  he hit it  he's doing something with that  and he felt he had to move it  but if they didn't see it  now on the way out  they might see it  right  so what do you do  so I opted for the  toss something on top of it  thing  like a natural toss  like maybe  right  like  throw your Rolling Stone magazine over  it  yeah  you read it or something 
[03:04:00]  yeah  exactly  it wasn't gonna be dignity  I was plum out of that  well why  they thought you might be having  a merry old time with it  a merry old time  putting it where the sun  don't shine  throwing your Rolling Stone magazine  because you know  we were cool guys  and of course we'd have  Rolling Stone  at our houses  I know  when we were banging chicks  because we're single  man  fucking  dudes and girls  we're living the rock  star life  the fucking hint 
[03:04:30]  you would have been cooler  if you said  hey just pretend  you can throw your hints  from a Heloise article over  how did we get ratings  with these shit  we were killing  we killed  yeah  exactly  so I threw something  in front of it  kind of over it  but I don't know  I think they left there  thinking I was  some kind of  wrangler  you know what I mean  yes I do  hey do they have  fag  I wasn't gonna  start looking at their butts  after what they saw  on the table 
[03:05:00]  please  get him away  from me Artie  he might try to do  something with the snake  well how could you not laugh  I'm doing an impression  of a plumber  sure  fucking A  when are you gonna do your song man  I don't know  I don't wanna do it like anytime  is Joe ready?  Joe's ready to go  Joe doesn't look ready  I can't do this to Anthony  I'm sorry  I'd like to hear the song  it might actually be good  no we can't do that

[03:12:00]  but I'm with you here  I'm kidding  I'm pitching a little harder than I should  considering that  you were weighing that  that was very good  Jesus  you can't  yeah I mean it wasn't that bad  that's what I did back then  okay  you got me my job okay  I learned it from you  okay  send this bit to  the morgue  the morgue  it's not that bad  that was the sunlight  it was good  that was funny  uh shit  uh Katie uh  rocks from Texas 
[03:12:30]  I'll kick her where the sun don't shine  that's not that bad  alrighty rock  burn the rest of that tape  will ya  good job  it's  you know what sucks about hearing that stuff  you have no idea what's happening next  I know that's what it is  I have no recollection of doing that  you're like so  I don't remember that  it's the anticipation of the horror  that could be right around the corner  yeah  yee  by the way  what happened  does anybody notice that uh  you rock really has a body like babe ruth now  he just gave up 
[03:13:00]  babe ruth  he just gave up  he said fuck it  anytime he walks around it's in fast motion  that's how you rock walks  all he does  he doesn't even move his legs  he tips forward  and the weight just propels him  jesus  he needs to walk until he hits a wall  now what  I don't know  I'm still recouping  that's what I'm  wow  I'd love another clip  oh that is  that's it really  really  that's all we got  god that is something 
[03:13:30]  oh he's got more though  oh he's got more  for another day  for another day  gotta like break that out  like just in uh  small doses  all right  uh the oprah thing  55 years old today  this is a good clip  that's been sitting around  so in honor of oprah  turning 55  she had a weird moment  on her show  with kate winslet  and her breasts  one of the things  I loved about this thing  obviously they're very  sexually explicit  but  I love the fact  that you have real breasts  thank you so much 
[03:14:00]  I love that you have real breasts  I love that you have real breasts  thank you so much  because in all the breast scenes  your breasts do what real breasts do  you mean that kind of thing  no no no  end up in my mouth  but she's got nice natural breasts  oprah  yeah  it gets worse  listen to this  do what real breasts do  you mean that kind of thing  no no no  and this kind of thing  no no no  but  when you 
[03:14:30]  there's that wonderful thing  you know  if you're a woman  you're lying on your back  she  Oprah sets this up with  there's a wonderful thing  if you're a woman  and listen to how wonderful  she thinks  this next  I can see where she's going  and this is  sounds like somebody  that really enjoys  looking at this  yeah there's nothing wonderful  about what she's about to say  no no  but  you know  when you  there's that wonderful thing  you know  if you're a woman  you're lying on your back  your breasts  they go to the same parts  face the same thing  yeah  why is that a wonderful thing  oh when they get under your armpits 
[03:15:00]  or they just hit the bed  on the side  they hit the bed  I know why actually  because a lot of times  a woman will use her fat tits  to steal a bratwurst  and when they part  you all of a sudden  have a german delicious snack  in between her big sweaty tits  that's the old fat woman's version  of the fucking fruit basket  yeah  she puts it under her armpits  and her nipples are sticking out her back  who doesn't love  when a woman takes her bra off  and her tits open  to find like  say a good nine inch hunk  of liverwurst  you can just 
[03:15:30]  fucking peel it off  her fucking sweaty chest  breastplate  what is that thing  on TV  what is that  fucking person  that is  I believe  a homosexual  it looks like  fucking  wow  that is bad  that is bad  you see the video  of the U-Haul lady  it's a visual  but definitely make sure  you get a peek  because when the chase  is finally over  she does the run for freedom  the running chase  is hysterical  the cop is on her  like where you going 
[03:16:00]  like fucking  you can't outrun  like helicopters  and  helicopters  that one cop behind her  caught up with her  so fucking fast  it's like when the kicker  picks up the ball  and decides he's gotta run with it  that's what it looked like  he doesn't know where to run  it's all awkward  everyone's faster than him  yeah  your breasts  they go to the same parts  face the center  yeah  but if you look at women  with not real breasts  their breasts are sticking  straight up  that's how you know 
[03:16:30]  yes indeed  god bless your real breasts  thank you too  Oprah knows a lot about breasts  yeah  on a bed  she loves them  so  I gotta pee  gotta pee  yeah  alright this is what  we're gonna do  yeah  looks like Prince  in a Tim Burton movie  ooh  oh boy  oh boy  alright  that didn't go as planned 
[03:17:00]  I'll be honest  I don't feel like  starting anything new  I think we gave the people  a good show today  I couldn't agree more  so why don't we play  I could agree  more  what my  Frank Sinatra song parody  again  it's fucking gold  Jerry  it's gold Jerry  I say you redo it  I say no  why don't we play  your favorite  Leonard Skinner song  Saturday Night Special  we'll get out of here  this Leonard Skinner song  dedicated to the late  great Billy Powell  56 died
