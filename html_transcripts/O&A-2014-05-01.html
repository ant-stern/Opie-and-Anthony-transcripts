<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of one host's allergies and medication, quickly transitioning to the Rob Ford crack-smoking scandal.  The hosts analyzed the leaked videos, comparing the situation to the Donald Sterling controversy and speculating on the motivations of those involved.  They played audio clips of Ford making crude and sexually suggestive remarks.  Listener calls followed, offering theories about the Sterling scandal (including a conspiracy involving Magic Johnson), which the hosts largely dismissed.  V. Stiviano's actions were heavily criticized.  The discussion expanded to the hypocrisy surrounding privacy concerns in both the Ford and Sterling cases, briefly touching on a P. Diddy car commercial and further clarifying Ford's offensive comments via a D.C. caller. Another caller discussed Magic Johnson's financial constraints related to a potential Clippers buyout.  Comparisons were drawn between Ford and Marion Barry.  The potential for a player boycott of Clippers games was also debated, referencing a USA Today article about a near boycott by the Golden State Warriors.  The show concluded this segment with Jim Norton's review of a Louis C.K. show, including a listener's explanation of a subway scene, and promotion of upcoming guests Bob Kelly and Sandy Cain.


The next segment began with a discussion of the Paul Simon and Edie Brickell domestic incident, followed by the arrest of Sandy Cain, a "naked cowgirl," for leaving her unattended guitar case.  Cain's planned appearance on the show to discuss her arrest and a potential lawsuit against Donald Trump was mentioned.  The hosts then dissected a controversial tweet by ESPN’s Stuart Scott on racism, debating its assertion that only those with majority economic and political power can be racist. This sparked a discussion about the complexities of racism and prejudice. A significant portion focused on offensive commentary about a Wheel of Fortune contestant, Trent, who appeared to have Down syndrome.  Shaq's apology for mocking a disabled fan was analyzed, followed by a discussion of a comedic Scott Steiner wrestling promo.  Bob Kelly was a guest in the studio during this segment.


The following segment centered on two comedians, one of whom was a guest.  The conversation included the guest's podcast, a vulgar discussion of body hair, and a detailed, sexually suggestive discussion of Jenny Hutt, a redhead known to the hosts,  centered around a recent incident where she drove her car into a body of water. A phone call with Hutt ensued, filled with insults and sexually suggestive comments.  The conversation touched upon child safety and the excessive amount of toys in one of the host's homes. A brief call from Rich Voss, discussing flooding in his area, concluded the segment.  Other comedians mentioned included Lenny Marcus, Steve C., Louis J. Gomez, and Dan Soda.  The interview with Jenny Hutt included descriptions of her physical appearance, driving incident, and financial status, frequently in sexually suggestive terms. One host detailed his extensive body hair shaving routine.


The next segment featured a phone call from Rich Voss, who expressed nervousness about calling. The hosts discussed Voss' upcoming podcast with Jim Norton as a guest marriage counselor,  bantering about Bobby's size and venue seating.  A joke Opie made about Voss' wife and Patrice caused upset.  The hosts discussed Voss' past podcast appearances, including anecdotes about his behavior and Jenny Hutt's wealthy father.  The conversation covered managing wealth across generations, gift tax implications, and crude remarks about money and relationships.  Sandy Kane’s absence due to weather was noted, with voicemails explaining her absence and detailing her recent arrest for topless performance in Times Square. Her past relationships with comedians were also discussed.  The story of Jameis Winston's crab leg shoplifting led to a discussion of stealing food from supermarkets, with the hosts sharing personal anecdotes and using exaggerated and offensive language. The hosts compared childhood games and social dynamics of different eras, transitioning to current events, social media, and smartphones. The show concluded with memories of childhood and mischievous activities, punctuated by crude humor, and plugs for upcoming shows and podcasts.


The final segment began with a humorous discussion of the impracticality of rotary phones and their perceived illegality in many businesses. Bob Kelly, a guest on the show, was then interviewed. They discussed Kelly’s comedic style, his recent Atlantic City performance, and his upcoming show with Nick DiPaolo.  Artie Lange's cancelled show and his appearance on DiPaolo's podcast, riotcast.com, were also discussed.  The hosts used frequent profanity throughout the segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  On the road.  Oh, there it is.  Morning, everyone.  Got hit with the allergies yesterday, I think.  What happened?  Got the itchy eyes, the scratchy throats, the achy teeth.  You ever get the achy teeth?  Achy teeth.  Then you get like a cold or something because the sinuses get all jammed up.  Oh, like in your gums?  Yeah, my teeth just ache. 
[00:00:30]  I just blew out my nose with some Afrin, though.  That shit's pretty good.  It's good.  You got to be careful, though.  This shit is addicting.  Just use it when you're stuffed up.  That's fucking righteous stuff.  It's a much better one, too.  It's a menthol one that comes from the pump with the two fingers.  It's a much stronger one.  Let's get that.  Let's get that right away.  Check that out.  Then I got the Vizine Eye Allergy Relief.  Vizine makes a special eye drop for allergies. 
[00:01:00]  Sufferers.  And then I threw a Claritin D in there for a goof.  I think it's the rain.  Because all that crap doesn't work.  You think the rain just pushed all the pollen down on my stupid head?  I think it's the rain.  What do we have?  Like a month's worth, they said.  In one day?  Month's worth of rain in one day.  Wow.  It's crazy.  So, I don't know.  I'm going to give this the old college try and see what happens.  Oh.  I feel like shit.  Have some brandy. 
[00:01:30]  You sweat it out.  Yeah.  Sounds like a good idea.  Why not?  Had to come in because of the Rob Ford thing.  Rob Ford's, he's great.  What a great leader.  I guess they have video of him smoking crack.  From last week.  From last week.  From last week.  Another one of these situations where, in our humble opinion, he got away with it the first  time because there's not an actual tape of him doing it the first time, right?  And then he got caught again. 
[00:02:00]  All he had to do was sort of like, you know, keep it on the down low, man.  But you're smoking at home with someone you know, your sister.  Yeah, this is somebody.  Obviously, he doesn't know he's being recorded here.  He's a drug dealer, yeah.  Yeah, more sneaky recordings going on.  Some sneaky Pete's out there with their...  Hey, man, we're all accepting this because of the Donald Sterling thing.  We love it.  We all want everyone to be taped in the comfort of their homes, and then we want that audio 
[00:02:30]  and video pushed out to the media.  We all accepted it, obviously.  But we cry about our own right to privacy whenever something pops up that might get into your shit.  Right.  You know, Donald Sterling is not a nice man, but, you know, I still have a problem with  how they call it.  It's ridiculous.  And now you've got Rob Ford being videotaped.  You know, obviously, he has no idea he's being videotaped.  Smoking crack where?  At his sister's house?  Was it at his sister's house?  I don't know.  Who's getting invited over to his sister's house? 
[00:03:00]  The story hit so late last night, I'm still trying to get to...  It's his sister's house.  It's the basement.  It was like a single light.  It was really kind of a dim, shitty room.  Right.  And the drug dealer was over there.  And I guess the...  Someone was suing...  I don't know if he was suing Rob Ford.  It might be the sister's ex-common-law husband.  Suing everyone.  Said that that's the thing that she smokes out of.  Like, the ex-common-law husband of the sister.  Ah, said, like, yeah, that's her pipe.  Yeah, I think you recognize it.  And, of course, this guy's trying to sell this. 
[00:03:30]  He's huge.  He's a fat guy.  Right.  He's sweating profusely.  Right.  His face is beet red.  Right.  And he's smoking crack.  It's just amazing.  How does he live?  How is he alive?  And he loves his fast food, obviously.  Oh, yeah.  Loves that.  I don't know.  He's on a re-election campaign.  He's trying to get re-elected in, like, a forgive and forget type thing.  Forgive and forget.  And he's, like, stepped away now.  This is probably going to finish.  Well, now he's saying he's going to go seek treatment, I guess.  I don't know.  But the Globe and the Mail, a Canadian newspaper, report viewing a second video of the mayor smoking what appeared to be crack cocaine. 
[00:04:00]  This one in the basement of his sister's home.  Early Saturday.  Okay.  What?  The video is part of a package of crack.  The video is part of a package of three videos.  Oh.  The dealer said was serendipitously filmed around 1.15 a.m., in which he says he is now selling for at least six figures.  Oh, Christ.  Fucking vultures.  Well, you can't even a drug dealer.  That's true.  The guy selling crack is a vulture anyway. 
[00:04:30]  That's true.  Yeah, no one's really freaking out as far as the...  So...  Emma Stone looks a lot different.  Huh?  Where is the Emma?  That was lovely.  That was her.  That was Emma Stone.  I know.  She doesn't look like Emma Stone, really.  Wow, there's no one at that baseball game.  Where was that?  What kind of distract do we get?  And what did it hit where the water's popping up?  Oh, it's a college game.  What?  The sprinklers went off?  Or is that a hose?  What's going on?  I don't know.  Some kind of geyser?  What the fuck? 
[00:05:00]  Man, that's a geyser.  Yeah, whatever.  Whatever.  And there's audiotapes of him saying some shit in a bar, too.  Really?  That was the first bit of info that popped up yesterday.  And then they said, oh, that's nothing compared to this videotape of him smoking crack.  It's a disaster.  He has to step aside, finish out his term, and then try to run again in four years.  A couple years later, he came back.  Try to run again? 
[00:05:30]  I mean, if he wants to run again.  He wants to run again, so he has to give himself time to clean it.  Then people might go, well, he's redeemed himself.  This guy's a goofball.  Yeah.  He'll never have a position in politics again.  Well, he's trying to run now, but is he a good mayor?  He's a goofball.  He's smoking crack.  That's what I'm saying.  If he had four years, like, no, he's not coming back from only shot.  I don't know how that Canadian stuff works, because like you were saying earlier, if this  was the United States, he'd have been gone.  Yeah.  Gone. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  The politician just knows, OK, I got to step down.  Yeah.  But they run things differently.  In the best interest of my constituency and my family, I will step down.  Yeah.  This guy's just like fucking more crack.  Yeah.  There's audio of him.  This was the first bit of info that hit last night.  But audio surfaces of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford ranting and swearing at a bar.  Ford said to mayoral candidate Stintz, I guess, who's running as well.  Yeah.  I'd like to fucking jam her. 
[00:06:30]  Does that mean fuck her in Canadian?  I'm not sure.  I'd like to jam her, eh?  I'm not sure if that has something to do with maybe stabbing.  Yeah.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  Get her in trouble.  You're going to jam up.  Like, maybe.  Jam her up, yeah.  I'd like to jam her.  I might be like, I'd just be jam your dick in her.  Sure.  Yeah, maybe.  We need some Canadian to help us out on that one.  Can we have audio?  Oh, we do.  Oh, we have the audio of that?  That was released.  All right.  Oh, man.  I went to bed too early last night.  It's on bullshit. 
[00:07:00]  Bullshit.  They went to Queen's Park.  They said, no way.  The committee that comes out says, yeah, I agree with all the gays.  I said, that's it.  I lost my concert of value.  You actually went to Queen's Park with it.  Well, they didn't exist.  You actually went to Queen's Park with it.  No, they went.  The organization went to Queen's Park.  And they're on the stands alone.  So at Queen's Park, you have to have every member to vote for it.  And Jim, I thought you were the one who-  No, no, no.  And Tim says, you know what? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, that's right.  I think it's right there.  He lost my vote.  I don't know what the fuck.  I can't vote Liberal because I don't like what Queen's doing.  Not because she's gay.  I just don't like the corruption.  NDP, I'm just not left-wing.  I just can't.  I am like Timmy Leck, but I can't.  I won't put a sign up on a phone.  I won't pay money.  I might have to vote Green.  I don't know what the fuck I'm going to vote.  I'm going to vote something.  See, that's incredible.  But I am absolutely going to vote. 
[00:08:00]  I'm probably going to vote Green.  I think I didn't say a fucking word.  But you're a Mrs. guy.  You have a Mrs. guy.  I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you.  How could you vote anything else?  No, no, I can't.  Hey, you're a gay man.  All right, I'm fine.  You don't like me that.  It's okay.  I don't mind.  Listen, man, I don't mind.  If I can vote, you'd rather vote against me than not vote on me.  I'd rather you, I'd rather you, I'd rather you lose.  This what goes on and he's, um, where the fuck is he hanging out?  He's a potty mouth. 
[00:08:30]  I don't want to vote you.  You know what you're going to do?  I'm on Karen Stitz.  I'm on fucking jam her.  But you, I can't talk to you.  I'm on fucking jam her.  Yeah.  I don't even know what that means.  So sorry.  All right.  I mean, fucker, right?  Yeah, this tape is really hard to understand, right? 
[00:09:00]  Well, it's a bunch of people yelling.  Right.  Talking over each other.  Yeah.  That was the big one, though.  He wants to, uh, jam.  Jam her.  Jam her.  I don't know what it means.  What the fuck is that about?  You're jamming me.  You're jamming me.  The Tom Petty.  Take back, joke, biscuit, boo.  Yeah, there you go.  Sal has no idea.  Look at him.  What?  Sal, you know what we're talking about?  Tom Petty, I'm pulling it up right now. 
[00:09:30]  Oh.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Wow.  Wowie kazowie.  Good job, Sal.  And if anybody has a problem with Sal's, uh, timing on this issue.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, yes.  All right.  Pitching the fit.  Pitching the fit.  Wow, I'm not used to that cue being played for the 45 minutes of saying it.  Wow.  This guy's been calling for two days. 
[00:10:00]  Jesus.  Travis, go ahead.  For two days, really.  Yeah, why don't you come back to work?  Go ahead, Travis.  For two days.  No, no, now you've got to turn it off.  Travis, go ahead.  Hello.  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah.  Hey.  I haven't been calling for two days.  First time caller.  No, you called yesterday and you were on hold for a long time.  Go ahead.  True story.  Definitely never did.  But anyways, I just haven't heard anyone talk about maybe the fact that this girl and  Magic Johnson kind of set Sterling up. 
[00:10:30]  I've heard that theory.  It's...  That's a dumb theory.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why would that happen?  Well, I just, I don't know.  I mean, they're very tight, I guess.  Well, you're bringing the theory to the show.  So why do you think that?  I just think that he wants to buy the team.  And he thought that by her setting him up, he could get, this would happen.  Because she's very trustworthy, right? 
[00:11:00]  She's a lunatic.  You understand that?  She is a crazy person.  I don't think Magic Johnson would associate with a lunatic that's walking around with a  fucking weird visor every day.  And now she's got a posse and they're all wearing hats with her name on it.  And she's just marching around LA because she's loving the attention.  That's the type of person Magic Johnson's going to associate with, right?  I thought that they were very tight.  I thought I had heard that.  That's all.  Yeah.  But you got to just, you know, think it over in your own brain.  There's no way Magic Johnson would do that. 
[00:11:30]  Nah.  Right.  All right.  Punch it out.  Thank you, Travis.  Thank you, sir.  Then there was another guy that was on hold all day yesterday with that theory.  And I'm just like, that's a ridiculous theory.  Everyone loves a good theory.  She announced, what, two days ago that she's going to be the president of the United States  of America.  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  Is she running?  I think Magic Johnson would stay, you know, clear of people like that if he was going to  do some dirty work behind the scenes to try to buy a basketball team.  Bitches nuts. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Show the picture of her walking around with the guys with, you know, with her name on their  hats.  And that picture is everywhere today as well.  Meanwhile, she was just fucking an old racist.  Right.  That's her claim to fame.  Right.  You were, if, if, I'm going to get, I can't say they were having sex.  She said they weren't, but I'm thinking they were.  Yeah.  There was something.  There was something.  Something there.  Because he said relationship.  Yeah.  She was at least trying to get his noodle hard.  Yeah.  A little sugar daddy action.  Right.  But anyway. 
[00:12:30]  Remember those candy sugar daddy, they pull your fillings out?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  The worst.  Fuck were those bad.  And Magic Johnson won't say he won't buy the Clippers.  Because all these celebrities, I mean, it's brilliant on their part.  They're all stepping forward like, oh, I would love to buy the L.A. Clippers.  I'm announcing today that I am putting my hat in the ring to try to buy the Clippers.  Hope your goddamn head is in it.  Oh, wow.  We've got to alert the media so he can be part of this.  Yeah.  Because like P. Diddy's saying he would love to. 
[00:13:00]  P. Diddy's not buying the L.A. fucking Clippers.  Someone said, oh, I'd like to hear his private conversation.  Of course.  P. Diddy.  Of course.  If there's anything racial or criminal that he's talking about.  Right.  Of course.  All these guys.  It's not a personal lie that would like their private conversations all of a sudden pushed out there.  Yeah.  To the media.  And all of a sudden you find out you've been recorded for a while now.  Right.  Would you be comfortable with that audio just being put out there on the Internet? 
[00:13:30]  Honestly ask yourself, you didn't know, the past month, let's say, someone was recording your private moments in your house.  Do you honestly think you'd be comfortable with that being put out there and think that nobody would really judge what you've been saying?  Ask the NBA players.  Exactly.  Instead of just everybody, let's just start there.  Yeah.  Is there an NBA player that would have no problem with his private conversations that he didn't know were being recorded, being pushed out there? 
[00:14:00]  The answer would be a no across the board.  But no, the answer would be sure, because it didn't happen.  Right.  So they'd be like, oh, yeah, no, I don't say anything.  Right, right.  Meanwhile, the reality of it is bullshit.  Right.  You'd be crucified.  Everyone, stop.  We're humans.  We say stupid shit when we're by ourselves or in the company of like-minded people.  Everyone loves to trash talk.  Exactly.  Everyone.  As soon as you leave the room, people are talking about you. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  What?  As soon as you leave the room.  Yep.  You think you're safe from that?  You're at a party and you leave the room or you go home?  That's why I hate leaving parties early.  It is so uncomfortable.  You've got to leave parties late.  It's uncomfortable.  You've really got to leave parties late.  You're like, all right, take it easy.  And you leave and you're like, oh, they're just rambling on about me.  You hear Colin's really, really funny bit about when you're dropping off family members.  What you do is everyone's trashing everybody. 
[00:15:00]  And then the person you trash is the one that you drop off next.  That you drop off next.  He's like, you start bashing.  They're still waving at you in the rear view mirror.  You're attacking them.  That's funny.  That's very funny.  Magic Johnson won't say he won't buy the Clippers because he wants his name in the press like anyone.  Yeah.  Anyone in public life wants to see their name in print.  And so, of course, he's not going to say, no, I'm not going to buy the team.  Here's another thing that people are stupid about. 
[00:15:30]  Look at the news cycle.  This one loses steam.  No one's going to give a shit.  Everyone's going to pull back and just go, no, I'm not going to buy that team.  I don't care who owns it, who gives a shit.  Oprah's buying the Clippers.  Really?  Sure she is.  Mayweather is buying the Clippers.  Really?  Sure he is.  None of these guys are buying the L.A. Clippers.  Maybe, maybe a Magic Johnson because he's in that world.  Maybe he'd get some guys together and they'd do it.  Who knows?  But the rest of them, no fucking way. 
[00:16:00]  I have to sell some of my movie theater.  Isn't he part of a big conglomerate?  Like he's a real small percentage of a guy.  A consortium?  Yeah, that's a consortium.  I'm sure.  Yeah.  But enough with the P. Diddy.  He's not buying the Clippers.  The P. Diddy.  He's too busy partying and trying to be cool.  Right.  He's thinking up a new name.  His whole job is to make all of us think he's the coolest man alive.  Oh, yeah.  What's the latest commercial where he has his bow tie, but it's untied? 
[00:16:30]  Because he's still partying in his...  The car commercial where they're out in the desert?  Yeah.  Yeah.  At the club out there in the desert?  It just says cool.  Oh, yeah.  P. Diddy is cool.  P. Diddy.  We wish we were as cool as P. Diddy.  Look at this.  Look at this.  They're in the desert.  And then they find an oasis.  Right.  Run by Diddy.  Of course.  What is this, a car?  I don't even know.  Is it a car commercial?  Yeah.  Okay.  I didn't even know. 
[00:17:00]  Come on.  I just knew they were in the desert walking and P. Diddy shows up.  Yeah.  A little y'all's car.  Look at P. Diddy.  I don't know.  He had a long night.  He still has his tux on.  Good song they're playing.  Your mind is playing tricks on you.  We're gonna die out here.  Oh, no.  Oh, my.  Look at that.  No, stop.  We're seeing things.  It's just a mirage.  Welcome to the soiree.  Are you sure this is a mirage?  The Fiat over there has four doors.  Oh, boy. 
[00:17:30]  The Fiat only makes small cars.  It's not real.  Yeah, you're right.  Bye, Diddy Mirage.  You're definitely going down now.  The all-new four-door Fiat 500L.  Unbelievably big.  I'm gonna take Diddy Mirage with me.  You think Pharrell makes a lot of money from this song?  Oh, boy.  He signed away all the rights, I heard.  Oh, did he?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  That was not smart on his part.  Wow.  Really.  There you go.  The P. Diddy. 
[00:18:00]  He's also selling his water in that commercial and his TV channel.  Of course he is.  Plugs for everything throughout.  Plugs for everything.  You think that was part of the deal to get him to do the commercial?  Oh, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  You can see a big, like, in the background, there's his big channel logo for his TV channel.  Yeah.  What's his channel?  Revolt, I think, is what it's called.  Revolt.  I think, really.  All right.  Well, let's say hi to Sully in D.C.  Sully!  Hey, what's up, boys?  I saw hi.  Go ahead, buddy.  Hey, I, uh, I was listening to that tape a little bit, and that broad, he's talking about 
[00:18:30]  the lesbian.  So he says, I want to jam her.  If you just listen a little bit more, he says, but she doesn't want me.  Ah.  So.  All right.  Is she cute?  Uh, I'm not sure.  My, like, my brother-in-law, he's Canadian.  He tells me they all look like shit anyway, so.  I haven't seen many, um, attractive to heterosexual men, uh, politician lesbians, quite frankly. 
[00:19:00]  Mm.  Bella Abzug?  Was she a lesbian?  Oh, boy, was she.  That one that was running for mayor of New York City?  Boy, was she.  She not very attractive.  She was, uh, I think you're right about that.  As far as, you know, what the average heterosexual male would deem attractive.  Yeah.  Right.  Now, the lesbian woman might find this fuckin' uncontrollably, uh, beautiful.  Uh, this guy's more on Magic Johnson.  Josh in Maine. 
[00:19:30]  Josh.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Uh, that Magic Johnson theory is stupid, uh, just from the fact that Magic Johnson doesn't  have the money to be a majority owner of a basketball team.  I mean, I can't imagine he'd go to all this trouble to buy 3% of the Clippers like he did  with the, with the Dodgers there.  Yeah.  Does he have 3% of the Dodgers?  Yeah.  He owns a very small percent of the Dodgers.  But if you, if you, you know, how it's reported in the media, it's like Magic Johnson owns the, 
[00:20:00]  you know, the Dodgers.  Yeah.  He's a minority owner.  You're right.  He doesn't have enough money, but, but he'll, he would, I guess, be the figurehead if, if  he got a whole bunch of people together to buy the Clippers, you know?  Hmm.  I'm sorry.  Oh, I'm good.  And yes, we all know that DC reelected, uh, you know, a crack smoker.  But he had time off.  But Marion Barry didn't just get reelected, I don't think, didn't, wasn't there like a 
[00:20:30]  period where...  Yeah, there was a few years in there.  And there was a constituency there that doesn't give a flying fuck that he was fucking...  This is Rob Ford, though.  There's just too much.  There's just too much on him.  Yeah, that's true.  There's just way too much on him.  With Marion Barry, it was like one video in a hotel room.  He's got no deniability, this guy.  Yeah, multiple videos.  I don't know.  And he didn't come across as a goofball either.  Rob Ford comes across as a complete and not a goofball. 
[00:21:00]  Pretty good.  Everyone's...  Everyone's taping him and just laughing at him.  There was a tape that came out in March we didn't even bother with, where he was drunk  on the street.  Yeah.  And they're taping him and he's saying silly shit and everyone's just laughing.  And they're not laughing with him.  They're laughing at him.  And he's the mayor of Toronto.  Yeah, a black city is a lot less likely to let a black mayor go away if they can help  it than just this big, fat, white...  You know, the people in Toronto are probably just enough with this guy.  Yeah, I think they've had it.  I just don't think he has a shot whatsoever at this point. 
[00:21:30]  No, the people have got to be thinking, hey, I don't think anything's really getting  done here.  Right.  You know?  Good for him.  So that's it on the Rob Ford, I guess, for today?  Look at us.  It's a video of him smoking crack and we're like, yeah, of course this came out.  You know?  Oh, speaking of the Sterling thing, it's being reported today that he's going to fight it.  Yeah.  He's not going down without a fight.  Yeah, I guess he talked to somebody over there at Fox News. 
[00:22:00]  Sterling?  Yeah, he talked to some sports reporter.  Was that before the thing, though?  But very quickly.  Yeah, and he was asked.  Do we have that clip?  This was yesterday.  No, he was asked and the reporter didn't record it, but he said that he heard this from him.  Right.  And asked him, are you going to sell if they sell you?  And he goes, the team is not for sale.  Well, I am not selling this team.  And this is yesterday.  So now what do the Clippers do? 
[00:22:30]  What do the players do?  They're still playing for this guy.  They just play.  They're still playing for this guy.  Of course, this will all go away.  In the end, they're still playing for him.  Uh-huh.  But they have to contractually.  It's in a couple of years, if he's still there, that's when it's going to hurt him.  I don't think they can leave now.  Like, you can't.  He would have a legitimate lawsuit against him.  If you're a basketball player and no one else is calling and you're on the Clippers, what are you going to do?  You think you're really going to be like, well, for my principles, I'm leaving and being unemployed. 
[00:23:00]  No, you're going to stay right.  I'll fuck where you are.  Because the money is nice.  Right.  It's a very nice life they got.  He knows that.  But the fact is, they're still playing for Donald Sterling.  Uh-huh.  No matter how you try to, like, spin this fucking thing.  He owns the team right now.  He owns the team, and as you guys continue to win, you're just making the team worth more money.  Worth more.  For Donald Sterling.  Putting more money in his pocket.  Right.  So you can do your standing ovations, and you can... 
[00:23:30]  Put your shirts on inside out.  Inside out.  And you can wear your black socks, and the fans can bring any sign they want to the game.  But the fact remains, everyone is there supporting the owner, Donald Sterling.  Every night that you go out there, you're pretty much stepping out into that proverbial cotton field, as they've been saying.  Right.  Yes, that's it.  That's right.  Back on the plantation.  Right.  Why is she hiding her face, though?  Why is this woman... 
[00:24:00]  I think she wants to make it her thing.  She's an idiot.  But, you know, it's a...  Yeah, she's an attention seeker.  Everybody wants a little bit of their own privacy and their own...  They want to control when their image and their shit leaks out.  Isn't that funny?  Yeah, she's doing that for her privacy, meanwhile.  I strongly think she doesn't give a fuck what Donald Sterling said, but she realized she had gold and went, oh, man, this is going to be my time now.  She don't care.  And then she went visor shopping.  Yeah.  Because that's her thing out there.  Did you see the picture?  That might be the one where the guys are all wearing the hats around her, Jimmy. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, I'm looking at that right now.  Yeah.  So she's got a posse and all the guys have a hat with her name on them.  And a bodyguard.  They said that she was trailed by cameras rollerblading around this $1.8 million duplex that Sterling had bought for her.  Right.  Yeah, he's not the real...  Look, the guy's an asshole, but he bought her a $2 million place.  How do you not be in a relationship?  You're not fucking a guy who bought you a $2 million place?  What's going on there? 
[00:25:00]  Maybe she's just good at leading someone on.  Yeah.  She's a genius if she did that.  I'll get you some juice, baby.  I don't know.  Let's say hi to David in Connecticut.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, David.  You guys should take a look online.  If you just Google the Sterling depositions, he's got depositions out there.  Where he's talking about prostitutes sucking them off.  All sorts of stuff.  It's crazy.  I don't even know if it's this woman V or not. 
[00:25:30]  I'm trying to find the one I tweeted a few days ago.  It was hilarious.  Yeah, I mean, and there's multiple.  I mean, it's not just one.  There's a bunch of these things.  There's one where he just went off, and they said,  that's not what we were asking you.  I'm just trying to find it right now.  I don't know, because I have to go way back in my timeline.  If you can find any of those depositions online, Sam, that would be good.  Oh, wait.  This might be it right here.  Let's see. 
[00:26:00]  Well, I fool around sometimes.  I do.  When a girl seduces me and tells me all of these hot stories, it's hard to read, sorry, and dirty things,  and tells me how much she wants to suck on me, and takes my shoes off, and licks my feet, and touches me.  When I'm in a limousine, she takes all of her clothes off.  The limo driver said, what is going on?  And she started sucking me on the way to Mr. 
[00:26:30]  Really?  Mr. Coon's house?  Is this fake?  Mr. Coon's house, and I thank her.  I thank her for making me feel good.  And then the guy, the lawyer, whatever, says, sir, the question was, is this your handwriting?  Is that real?  Come on.  Is that real?  Come on.  No, I think it's real.  Mr. Coon's house?  Which goes with the thing we brought up again yesterday, that the name always fits the story.  Oh, yes.  Look out. 
[00:27:00]  I don't know if that's real.  Come on.  I don't know.  There's other depositions that are pulling around out there.  It's not just that one.  Right.  I mean, you know, is it incorrect?  It could be, but I think it came from the smoking gun, and that site's pretty...  Is it the one I read, pretty much?  Yeah.  Okay.  I think so.  Yeah.  I'm not...  I've got to be honest.  I'm not certain that...  I'm not completely sure it's true, but...  All right.  If you're saying the smoking gun has it, that... 
[00:27:30]  Oh, man.  That's what I'm talking about.  All right.  Thank you, David.  All right.  Thank you.  And now we get this question again.  Bishop in Chicago.  Bishop!  Good morning, boys.  Good screwing around.  I was just going to say, do you think there's any possible way Sterling knew he was on tape?  They sound set up.  He didn't say anything that bad.  He wasn't dropping end bombs or anything crazy like that.  No, he did not know he was on tape.  I don't think so.  This show, I think, across the board.  You know, we have differing opinions on all sorts of topics on a daily basis here, but 
[00:28:00]  I think all three of us are convinced that he did not know he was being taped.  And I think TMZ needed something from that woman, you know, before they posted it, because they might be in a bit of trouble for even just posting that shit.  They cover their ass.  Depending on the law.  I don't know what the law is in L.A. where TMZ is.  But I have no doubt in my mind that he had no idea he was being taped.  There's just too much to lose.  And they're also saying there's a lot more audio out there. 
[00:28:30]  And maybe those audio tapes, maybe, we don't know, maybe he is saying the N-word.  And maybe they're holding that back.  Who knows?  All right.  Well, thanks for taking my call.  All right, Bishop.  But then we'll get more people saying, but they're saying he did know.  Yeah.  It's what's the upside of him knowing and being recorded and saying things that he knows would get him in trouble.  I watch the news.  They tell me something. 
[00:29:00]  And then I immediately believe the opposite.  Yeah.  And then I go and I try to, like, you know, figure this shit out on my own.  That's how I go about my day.  Yeah, that's the safe way.  Or I know they're being incredibly dramatic to keep their viewers.  So then I see, okay, where is this story?  Where does it actually lie?  Yeah.  You know?  Like CNN, everything is now breaking news.  Yeah.  There's not that much breaking news. 
[00:29:30]  No, no.  They have breaking news on the Malaysian air disaster still.  There's no breaking news there.  Yeah, well, the Fox News alerts are just now at the top of the hour.  Right.  That's all they do.  And that was their breaking news for a while.  During the war, you know?  Because someone's...  Breaking news.  Because someone figured out, you know, when you...  The old days...  We're older gentlemen.  When you saw breaking news or a special report...  Oh.  You interrupt this program for a special news report.  Everyone stopped what they were doing.  Right. 
[00:30:00]  And these guys, you know, on these cable news outlets, they understand that mentality.  Gong!  A special alert.  A Fox News alert.  I do get tricked, too.  If I'm at the gym or whatever and I see breaking news, I'll go to the TV and go, oh, that's  right.  They do this all the time.  I'm a dummy again.  The president is speaking at a factory.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who gives a shit?  That's not breaking news.  It's not breaking news.  Who cares?  It usually meant a president got shot.  Right.  That's what it meant.  Or a plane went down.  Something huge.  There were only a few things, you know, that fell under the category of breaking news. 
[00:30:30]  A special news bulletin.  Not even...  I guess the over-the-top, huge A-list celebrities, too, got a little breaking news action.  John Wayne, dead.  Yeah, maybe.  But for the most part, it was meant for some serious shit.  Right.  We're going to war or whatever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not this horse shite.  Snowy from Michigan.  I'm kind of with Snowy a little bit here. 
[00:31:00]  Snowy, go ahead.  Morning, gentlemen.  Hey, buddy.  Yellow.  I'm kind of with you guys.  I mean, if these players really hit the owner that much, Jimmy's right.  You can't not play.  But why don't you tank the game?  You can't do that.  I think this is...  No.  But they're saying, you know, this is bigger than the game itself, so...  I don't know.  Imagine the game's tied.  You got a guy on the foul line.  He can win the game.  Let's say there's no time on the clock.  And then he just kind of looks toward the owner's box, even though he's not allowed to be at the games. 
[00:31:30]  And then just fucking throws two air balls from the free throw line.  These guys are good enough.  They can throw the game and not make it look like they're throwing it, is what I'm saying.  But you're letting down your fans if you do that.  You're letting down your own personal legacy.  Yeah, this is what you've worked for your entire life.  People are supporting you, not the owner.  When they go to those games, they're not trying to support the owner.  It's about the team and the guy's playing.  I don't think...  That's what I do.  They're going to the game, though.  Your money's going in the owner's pocket, though, isn't it? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, I understand that.  They got a good team, but I don't think they're going to win the championship, so...  Yeah.  You know, you want to talk about a legacy.  All of a sudden, you know, you're the team that says, we're not playing anymore.  Oh, my God, what a story that would be.  That would get things done, yeah.  Yeah, but like I said, they're good enough.  They can mask it and make it look like they won't.  But, I mean, it's crazy.  Somewhere right now, they're feeling good about themselves with everything that went down.  But, like we said only a few minutes ago,  the fact remains, they're still playing for Donald Sterling, period. 
[00:32:30]  And the guy has come out, you know, either yesterday, I guess yesterday,  and said he's not going down without a fight and he's going to fight this thing.  He could ask for trades and stuff like that,  but, you know, there's a camaraderie I'm sure that those guys have as teammates.  Even though he's a scumbag, you don't want to just be a footnote.  Like, oh, yeah, they lost in the first round.  These guys are competitors.  They want to compete and win for their own, all those years they've put into it.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't play basketball for your whole life just to fucking miss a free throw on purpose.  Because the owner fucking, yeah. 
[00:33:00]  The 80-year-old owner is a racist.  Like, half of the owners probably are.  Yeah.  That's why I, that vote's going to be very interesting.  He's going to fight it.  Will it be unanimous?  This will be tied up in some kind of...  But what will the rest of the owners do?  Yeah, why is it an anonymous vote?  Like, why can't they, why don't they have to say, oh, that's right, they want their...  Uh-huh.  I see.  Oh, they want their privacy?  Yeah.  Of course, Jimmy.  Of course they do.  Oh, that'd be great if it was unanimous, like, in his favor. 
[00:33:30]  Oh.  All the owners, his vote.  Yeah, let them keep the team.  Then what do the players do at that point?  They realize that all the owners are racist.  I think, I think a lot of these players know they're, they might be playing for a racist  owner.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes, I think they have a pretty good idea that there's, there's more than one Donald  Sterling.  What happened?  As Oprah said, we're off the plantation.  Well, she's going to buy the team.  The plantation.  Like that fucking, like that floor of, of, of, when they play basketball, like that wooden 
[00:34:00]  floor is, is a fucking cotton field.  The plantation.  They go out, they play, it's a game, people.  And they make ridiculous amounts of money.  To equate that to slavery, because the owner said some off-color remarks, is so over-the-top  ridiculous.  You know, we were talking about this last night.  Like, there's, it's hard to get, like, someone, you never get, get them.  Like, you know, like, Patrice always said, I never met a racist.  Like, you can never nail somebody on it. 
[00:34:30]  And this is one of those shots where you, oh, it's confirmed.  Ah, there we go.  And that's why he's being sung, because you could, there's never real proof.  Right.  Or rarely is there proof.  But this time, the guy said it, it's on tape.  It's just never.  Gotcha.  Yeah.  It's one of those things where, like, this is as close to getting someone in the act  as we're ever going to get.  Right.  And privately, I guess, is the only way you can get somebody, because they're never going  to go, like, I don't want blocks at my games.  Thank you.  I'll take questions now.  Hear ye, hear ye.  And a lot of these players will continue playing just for their own, you know, greed. 
[00:35:00]  Let's be honest with each other.  Their lives are very, very good.  Hells yeah.  They make millions of dollars playing.  Nice gig.  And they don't want to fucking ruin that whatsoever.  Let's say hi to Charlie in Jersey.  Charlie.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey, man.  Hey, I heard a crazy rumor yesterday that it's, you know, the team is really going to play  because they're going to play for solidarity and they're going to play for their brotherhood 
[00:35:30]  and they're going to play really, really hard.  And the rest of the teams are going to, like, back off a little bit, let these guys win.  They wind up going to the championship, winning the championship.  The team's value triples in value.  And this guy gets even more richer, but the story is not the guy getting more richer,  but it's the solidarity of the team sticking together to out this guy,  and they become NBA championships.  What do you think of that?  That's a great movie script.  Wow.  Yeah, really. 
[00:36:00]  Look at that.  Does the water boy make a shot when the star breaks his knee  and the water boy's throwing the ball in and it dumps off the head of someone who goes in?  And everybody applauds.  Yeah.  And then the dream that the value triples,  it's $150 billion or whatever that frick it is,  and then they wind up winning the championship and look what they did.  They stuck together, they held firm,  and they stayed with their rights and their brotherhood.  I don't know what he's getting at.  He's all excited.  I think people are genuinely offended by this guy and genuinely bothered by what he said. 
[00:36:30]  Sure, sure.  But, you know, they can't just not play for him.  You have to.  You're contractually bound to play for this guy.  Oh, I mean, they're parading all these players on these news shows.  Are they ever?  They should go,  Hey, man, you know,  how do you feel with the fact that these players are still playing for them?  Mm-hmm.  How would they spin that?  Well, no, because...  No, they don't have a choice right now.  Right.  No, I'm just saying, 
[00:37:00]  especially now,  the playoffs,  what are they going to do?  Like Jimmy said,  he'd be a footnote,  a season championship footnote,  because the owners are racist.  Yeah, it's everything I worked for since I was,  you know,  a kid,  to be in the NBA  and get to the championships,  and I'll just, you know,  throw it away.  Yeah, and it wasn't even like the owner said it at a team meeting to the team,  where they're like,  okay,  it's ridiculous.  They have to do what they have to do. 
[00:37:30]  Work your whole life,  you get out of a terrible neighborhood,  and you don't want to win the championship,  because, like,  that's even giving the guy more power,  because, like,  I allowed this guy in conversations he had in his home.  Right.  Like,  how naive am I to think that an 80-year-old is this great guy,  this 80-year-old billionaire is a terrific...  As long as the business of the Clippers was being run legitimately and without any problems,  without any more problems than any other team, let's say,  why should they give a shit what the opinions of a doddering old man are? 
[00:38:00]  Well, UCLA gave him money back.  They gave back money from kidney research.  Kidney research.  Because this guy donated kidney research money,  and I guess you're better off dying than having a racist money.  They're giving back all of his donated money,  and that's a funny Twitter I read.  It's like,  oh, are they going to give back his fine?  Right.  They'll keep his fine money.  Right.  That's ridiculous.  You shouldn't give back money that's been donated.  By the way,  why would the NAACP give the money back?  Isn't using a racist money the best way to get back at a racist? 
[00:38:30]  You're using his money for something else?  You'd think.  Who cares if it buys him piece of money?  For the advancement of the colored people.  And the whole boycott of the game is not far-fetched,  because USA Today had an article.  I think it was yesterday.  I think I just found it.  According to a report from Bay Area News Group columnist Marcus Thompson II.  This is in the USA Today.  It's not one of those, you know, dumb blogs.  The Golden State Warriors had a dramatic plan in place to boycott tonight's playoff game, 
[00:39:00]  meaning last night's game, two nights ago, I guess, at this point,  against the Los Angeles Clippers,  had NBA Commissioner Adam Silver not adequately punished Clippers owner Donald Sterling.  Silver's decision to issue Sterling a lifetime ban changed their plans.  The Warriors concerned the plan, concocted the plan in a 30-minute team meeting,  and were hoping the Clippers would join them in their boycott.  USA Today Sports Sam Amick reports that there were discussions for every playoff team to boycott their games tonight as well. 
[00:39:30]  Wow.  The Warriors' actual plan was stunning, and had it gone down, the sports world would have just about melted down.  So that would have been a reaction to him not doing anything.  Right.  The Warriors were going to go through...  But now I'm wondering that, you know, now that everyone knows Sterling's going to fight this,  if maybe, you know, this is making players think again.  Who knows?  The Warriors were going to go through pregame warm-ups,  take part in the National Anthem, and starting lineup introductions.  They were going to take the floor for the jump ball, dropping, dapping, dapping up the Clippers' players as is customary before games. 
[00:40:00]  Then once the ball was in the air, they were just going to walk off, all 15 of them.  Wow.  I bet the Clippers would have scored a lot of points that game.  And there's a 1,500 to nothing block.  Can you imagine the Clippers kept playing hard and smiling at the owner's booth?  Looks like it's legit.  It would have been our only chance to make a statement in front of the biggest audience  that we weren't going to accept anything but the maximum punishment, Curry said. 
[00:40:30]  We would deal with the consequences later, but we were not going to play.  So this wasn't as far-fetched.  The plan was organized by Curry, David Lee, Jermaine O'Neal, and Draymond Green.  They were planning on reaching out to the Clippers about the idea,  but Silver's action was enough that they decided to go ahead with the game.  Wow.  That was yesterday in the USA Today.  I saw that as a tweet, and then I just assumed right off the bat that it was some silly block. 
[00:41:00]  The USA Today especially, they play it pretty safe in general.  All right.  Go for them.  That's where we stand with that whole situation.  It'll start losing steam.  It'll get a few more mentions when he decides to appeal some decision or calls in the lawyers,  uses his billions or billion dollars to fight this.  What else has he got to do?  I don't think he's going anywhere. 
[00:41:30]  He's an old man.  He's not going to accept the last years of his life being a complete and utter disgrace.  Why would he accept that?  He has nothing to lose.  If he was a younger guy, he could probably figure some shit out, right?  He's got a lot of money and time.  And some time.  Right.  What else is he going to do?  And his family.  He's probably worried about his...  Like, why would he want to give this team to his kids?  Right.  He hasn't.  Right.  Or his ex-wife.  Right.  His ex-wife has a legitimate suit. 
[00:42:00]  Sure.  And then what?  The NAACP wants to meet with him or something?  Because it's never enough, right?  It's never enough.  You've got to keep going and going and going.  They want to meet with him because if he apologizes, then they can accept the money that he's giving.  They want to meet with Silver.  Yeah, here's the article.  Yeah, they don't want to give that money back.  Okay.  Those groups still want to meet with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver to discuss diversity in the executive ranks of the Professional Basketball League  and to figure out ways to ensure such situations don't happen again. 
[00:42:30]  But diversity on the floor.  Oh, Silver, I'm sorry.  I think you meant Sterling.  My fault.  Diversity on the floor?  That's crazy.  That's the only place.  Sports is the only place where they don't acknowledge diversity on the playing field.  Right.  But why not?  Uh-huh.  We get fire people here in New York City that are not, you know, the best qualified for the job.  Sure.  What's wrong with sports?  So how about the NBA to have a little diversity? 
[00:43:00]  Let's get some short Jews on the floor.  Right.  That's the only place where there is no diversity.  But then they say, well, but in the front office there should be, or the owners, there should be some diversity.  Why?  You're in the sports world where you openly acknowledge it's not about diversity.  Right.  It's the person who's the best at their position.  Yeah.  Why should that be different in another job?  Right.  Across the board, I think.  Uh-huh.  Diversity is ridiculous. 
[00:43:30]  The best person should get the job, period.  Correctamundo.  Period.  What do you want?  Yeah, whatever.  Okay.  Yes.  I can't believe this fucking Louis review.  Oof.  What?  What happened?  Just the things you're talking about in this review.  Oh, Jimmy, you made the review.  Oh, I didn't even notice that.  I read it.  I hadn't even noticed.  I was going to get to that.  Oh, no, but I didn't even notice.  Oh.  Jim Norton.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, this is a good review.  Jim Norton made the Louis C.K. review, which was a great review in what paper? 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, it's a good review in the Post.  In the Post.  How smart he wants to take that time off.  I saw all four episodes last night that they gave us, and wow, Jimmy, great job.  Oh, yeah.  The show in general, it's Louis C.K.'s show, man.  Wasn't that open arrow with the fucking garbage truck?  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  Yeah.  Really good.  What balls are they to take that time instead of, and she put it right, instead of force  riding, like what, that was a ballsy move, man, to just say, fuck it, I'm going to sit 
[00:44:30]  for a little while and let it breathe a bit, and he did, and what a smart dude.  Yeah.  He is.  He's coming in next week.  I only have one question I've got to ask.  Oh.  I'm obsessed with how things are filmed these days.  Yeah.  And is Louis so famous that he could just get a subway car to film for the day?  I know.  And how do they do that?  I thought the same.  You did?  Okay.  I'm like, look, they've got to close down that subway platform.  But how does that work?  Because other movies use subway cars and stuff. 
[00:45:00]  So there's got to be, like the city has some kind of plan in place, I'm assuming.  Yeah.  Is it in the middle of the night?  Where is that subway car?  I can ruin it for you.  Oh, yeah.  It's off Chelsea Piers.  There is a, it's like a studio, and they have stuff like that.  They have like a mock-up of the, what's the 59th Street fucking bridge thing?  The 59th Street Bridge?  No, that thing that goes across it.  Oh, the tram.  Yes, the tram, whatever.  The Roosevelt Island tram or whatever. 
[00:45:30]  And they have like a four subway car thing.  It's like, that's just for sets.  But does it move?  They have an actual tram?  Yeah.  I made the whole thing up.  April Falls.  But you were good.  Why can't you hold it?  I saw you breaking down again.  You started getting cheeky.  It's just so stupid to lie about that.  There's a dumb thing to lie about that.  They have a fucking tram.  Yeah, a fake tram.  I couldn't think of the word tram. 
[00:46:00]  Subway.  I'm like, what am I doing?  And I'm like, why am I doing this?  There's brilliance in the first four episodes, and all I want to ask is about the subway car.  Subway car.  And how you get that done.  That's all I want to know.  There's a whole bureau of movie making for the city.  Like some guy is in charge of handling all that shit.  Right.  You want to make a movie, you've got to go to them.  Everybody's in this season, too, man.  The first four episodes.  Everyone we know. 
[00:46:30]  My God.  Bob Kelly, Jim Norton, Nick DiPaolo.  Fucking Charles Grodin was hilarious.  Charles Grodin was.  That was the doctor.  That was an amazing scene.  That was really good.  He's just fucking like, not even looking him in the face.  The writing for the Fat Girl episode is fucking brilliant.  Did you see Jimmy?  He goes, ugh.  Yeah, yeah.  It's so funny.  But the writing for that episode is fucking brilliant.  Patel is outside the fucking. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, right.  David Feller.  Yeah, we shot that on the same day.  I remember seeing Dave before.  Yeah.  Yes, Kenny.  Kenny.  I just found an article online.  There's a, about that Louie subway shoot thing.  I sent it to Sam's Gmail.  Oh?  Oh, good.  Well, maybe we'll find out before Louie comes in.  Yeah, I mean, it's not, if you want to get a subway, it's like, you know, whatever.  Here you go.  They only serve sandwiches at a certain hour.  FX Louie and the case of TV's fake NYC subway solved.  Randall's Island Fire Academy Subway Simulator? 
[00:47:30]  No kidding.  Oh.  There's the answer.  Oh.  I knew it'd be, it's just not easy to just get on a subway and film all day.  They say we need to take your subway.  What do they say in there?  You don't have to read the whole article.  Just the death, it's a fireman's training.  I went there once, Randall's Island.  Brother Weezer's broadcasting after 9-11 on Randall's Island at the Fire Academy over there.  Yeah.  It's a sick, sick facility. 
[00:48:00]  Really cool.  But I didn't see the subway thing.  That's pretty cool.  But they got a subway simulator.  The whole thing's set up with a platform, and I guess if they have an emergency, that's how they practice.  Right.  And yeah, he said they just got five heavy grips up there to rock it.  Right.  To look like it's moving back and forth or whatever.  Wow.  And that's it.  It's a good one.  Five guys can move that thing.  Yeah.  Five big brawny firemen.  Five big guys.  Right. 
[00:48:30]  Very cool.  That's a third of the way to a regular subway car anyway, so five guys with the handles can...  You got cheeky so fast.  Diane Sawyer is going to be interviewing Louis C.K. on Friday, I believe, as her person of the week.  And they're going to be eating pizza at Ben's Pizza.  Which is Ben's Pizza.  What about it?  That's how they're going to get together?  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, Diane Sawyer is interviewing Louis at Ben's Pizza.  It's airing Friday, I believe, as her person of the week. 
[00:49:00]  And Ben's Pizza, of course, is in the opening shot.  And it's also right down the street from the Comedy Cellar.  It's really good, too.  I don't eat there often because I'm trying not to eat pizza.  But I've eaten there a few times.  It's very tasty.  I think we all have had a few slices at Ben's Pizza over the years.  I love pizza.  I do, too.  Oh.  Pizza rules.  All right.  We've got to talk about the crab legs.  Oh, yeah.  We've got to take a break, and then we're going to talk about crab legs.  Can I say how doucey it was?  And I said, I love pizza.  And I went, me, too.  Me, too.  Me, too.  Yay. 
[00:49:30]  We all love pizza.  Pizza is so good.  What a debate you're setting up.  There's just no reason for me to answer that.  Me, too, doesn't make it a pizza party.  We've got a great day today.  We've got Bob Kelly coming in.  He's got a lot of big shows.  And he's playing at the Stress Factory this weekend.  Oh, yeah.  And tonight he's at Harrah's in Atlantic City.  And also we've got Sandy Cain.  She's got a hell of a story to tell.  Oh, man.  Hey, man.  Come on, man.  We haven't talked to her in a while.  Yeah, well, she was... 
[00:50:00]  Oh, you guys.  She was in jail.  Oh, shit.  Really?  Yes.  She'll tell the whole story in about an hour.  She's got a bone to pick with the NYPD.  Oh, I bet she does.  Impersonating a human there.  Oh, God.  She rules.  And don't forget, our podcast is out there.  I hear it's doing very well.  People are loving the Best of Rich Voss ONA podcast.  So go get that in all the usual places, okay?  Wait.  Yeah, it was yesterday.  It made the paper. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, well, two days ago.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll read that story next.  Page six.  I didn't know that.  All right.  Fantastic.  We'll find out what happened to Sandy Cain, and we'll interview her a little later today.  Ah, let me think. 
[00:51:00]  Forty-three years ago today for this song.  Yeah?  Yeah.  A little brown sugar.  That's something.  We're learning more about Paul Simon, too.  Yeah, what happened?  Him and Edie Brickell had a little tiff.  Well, Edie...  The last we heard.  Yeah, Edie Brickell, and they were hauled in for what?  Domestic...  For disturbing the peace.  That was the charge, or the possible charge, or whatever.  Yeah.  Turns out, Edie Brickell gave Paul Simon a nice smack across the face. 
[00:51:30]  Smacked him?  Bitch slapped him?  It's in the paper today.  For saying something, um...  What the hell?  How'd she put it?  Oh, God damn it.  She insulted him?  No.  Or he insulted her?  In such a way that she couldn't take it, so she smacked him across the face.  Wow.  They were in a recording studio.  Oh, boy.  And she said that he can't take criticism.  Uh-oh.  Oh, here it is. 
[00:52:00]  Okay.  I slapped Paul for heartbreak.  Heartbreak.  Okay.  Uh, Edie Brickell said she slapped Rock and Paul Simon in the face for doing something  that broke her heart.  Uh-oh.  And they were in a recording studio.  So I'm filling in the blanks myself.  They're recording some shit together in a home studio.  Uh-huh.  She criticizes something.  Maybe a lyric, or maybe his voice or something.  Right.  He don't want to hear that shit.  So he probably said something like, who are you?  You had one stupid song.  Right.  Look at yours.  And that broke her heart, because she probably wants to be known as a, you know, as a successful 
[00:52:30]  songstress.  So she smacked him across the face.  Bitch slapped him.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  And then I guess her mother called the cops?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Fucking mother-in-laws.  Dusted up because he couldn't handle being criticized in any manner and became confrontational.  That's got to be about his singing or something. 
[00:53:00]  Her one-hit wonder.  He probably said that, too.  Right.  You were a one-hit wonder.  What do you know?  You only had one hit.  Yeah.  I'm Paul Simon.  God damn it.  You're a Scarsboro Fair.  Me, motherfucker.  That's right.  What did Santa Cain do?  What did she do?  What is the paper reporting?  Naked cowgirl Sandy Cain was thrown in the slammer for six hours on Saturday for leaving 
[00:53:30]  her guitar case unattended on the corner of 45th and 7th.  Well, her money's in there, though.  I think she puts her money in her boots.  Oh.  Yeah.  So how far away was she?  She told me it was, like, right behind her.  It was maybe a foot or two away from her.  If she puts that money in her fucking boots, that tells you right there that Mom was right  when she says, don't put that fucking money in your mouth.  You don't know where it's been.  Right.  Oh, who?  That's in circulation somewhere?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So she confronted the cops? 
[00:54:00]  Well, she said, it was like I was on Law & Order.  The Times Square performer complained to us.  My guitar case was maybe a foot away.  Meanwhile, there are a million criminals out there.  Criminals.  Cain, an outspoken former stripper, may have attracted cops' attention because she was brawless  and wearing pasties at the time she was cuffed.  Jesus.  I can't wait to talk to her.  While it's her regular work uniform, she says this is her first arrest and, quote, I  don't know if it's the new mayor or what. 
[00:54:30]  I started crying.  It was so humiliating.  Oh, no.  It's crying, man.  It's crying, man.  It's crying, man.  Yeah.  She said she wants to talk about how the cops treated her and she would also like to talk  about being part of a class action lawsuit against Donald Trump.  Trump.  What?  That's what she told me on the phone.  I don't know what that's about.  She rules.  She said that she paid $5,000 to be a member of Trump U.  What is that?  Well, she said Trump U more like fuck you. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, that's funny.  She'll repeat it.  Don't worry.  Trump U, my fuck you.  She'll say that.  Yeah, she will repeat it.  What, you don't like it?  What, are you gay?  What are you gay?  Jesus.  I said she's got a problem with Trump, the police, and the mayor, maybe.  We're going to get into all those things in about 45 minutes.  Oh, yeah.  Hang around today, will you?  Oh, boy.  Got a tweet from Unexpected P.  He writes, have you seen this tweet by Stuart Scott? 
[00:55:30]  Stuart Scott.  All right.  What's that about?  Everyone knows who Stuart Scott is, right?  Who's that?  He's a guy.  Oh.  He loves playing sports.  He's a good dude.  He's that guy.  He's blessed.  He's blessed.  I have no idea who that is.  He's an ESPN.  I'm telling you who he is.  Oh, I've seen his face.  He's blessed.  He has a job he loves.  Uh-huh.  Invaluable family and friends. 
[00:56:00]  He loves playing sports.  And most importantly, two great daughters.  Being a dad is the best.  No close second.  Uh-huh.  He's an idiot.  Who's that?  That's his profile.  Stuart Scott from ESPN.  The true racism, this is what he tweets, is group with majority economic and political power discriminating against others.  Uh-huh.  Blacks, Hispanics, can be angry, rude, but not racist. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, God.  What a cop-out.  Tell me.  That's such a cop-out way to, again, rude.  Did I say majority or minority?  Because I might have messed up.  It's a majority.  I did.  True racism is group with majority economic and political power discriminating against others.  Blacks, Hispanics, can be angry, rude, but not racist.  That's always the, uh...  Yeah, of course, because this way you can say and do what you want without having that same label attached to you. 
[00:57:00]  Zero accountability.  So it's only anger if a bunch of black kids beat the shit out of a white guy because they want to beat the shit out of...  It's like, why are you removing that motive from these individuals?  It's such a lie.  Black people can't be racist.  Really?  Such bullshit.  There's no black people in, um, in positions of power where they have used their racism against, uh, people that weren't, um, African American?  Is that true?  Oh, well, no, we're talking systemic racism. 
[00:57:30]  Shut up.  President's black.  Stop it.  Oh, yeah, I think black people could be racist.  Of course they can.  There are fucking, there are plenty of black racists.  Seen plenty of them.  I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna tweet them and say you're stupid.  Yeah.  I'm lazy today because I get an allergy attack, so I'm just gonna say,  I'm gonna say, hey, Stuart Scott, you're just stupid.  See how he handles that.  Blacks are so quick to pull out, uh, 
[00:58:00]  hey, what, hey, that white motherfucker.  Hey, white motherfucker.  Look at that white bitch.  Right.  Fuck that white bitch.  Right.  Get you white bitch.  Yeah, it's, that comes out, like, instantly, uh, during any kind of altercation.  And why is racism only a systemic thing?  Why is it only a, a government form of oppression?  That removes day-to-day hatred.  Right.  Like, why, why are you saying...  On an individual basis, yeah.  Why are you saying that people can't have that individual dislike? 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  You know, he, that's, it's just a, that's just a fucking, a lie.  That definition of racism has been floating around for a while now, and it's such a cop-out.  It's such a fucking, oh, you're a racist.  Oh, we can't be racist.  Really?  Really?  If he said that blacks aren't capable of, uh, instituting, uh, I guess, institutionalized  racism, I should have said institutes twice, but, uh, that's, okay, I have an easier time  with that, because blacks don't run most of... 
[00:59:00]  Oh, yeah, the black president, right.  But, no, no, but they, I'm saying in a society that's been set up, they, they haven't set  up where, uh, set up a society where white people aren't going to get, but he's not talking  about that.  He's not just saying that.  No.  He's saying on a day-to-day basis...  That black people can't be racist.  And he's saying all races have hate, bigotry, prejudices, only those with political, economic  power can be racist.  Institutionalized racism or, or systemic, not just...  He said beautiful souls in every race, bigots in every race.  Just my opinion, but racism takes power, prejudice only takes anger or fear. 
[00:59:30]  No.  No.  Sorry.  Incorrect.  He's making up his own definitions.  Can't do that.  I'm going to make up my definition.  A pencil is now a fork.  Oh.  There.  Nice.  There.  I just made a new definition for pencil, you eat with it.  Sure.  I do anyway.  Oh, okay.  So I pick up my sushi.  He's an idiot.  What was the Wheel of Fortune thing about? 
[01:00:00]  I saw all the tweets.  Yeah.  I just didn't...  I just couldn't go there.  What was his name?  Trent?  Trent was on Wheel of Fortune and what?  He was on Wheel of Fortune.  Well, Trent was a...  He's a little slow.  ...individual with...  No, it looked like Trent had Down syndrome.  Okay.  And he was very excited to be on Wheel of Fortune.  Right.  I guess.  I don't know how this worked out.  Like, they didn't do a Down syndrome day or a handy, capable day, as they say. 
[01:00:30]  But, because it was two women and then this kid, who, again, very rambunctious and very  excited to be there.  Huge Wheel of Fortune fan.  Huge Wheel of Fortune fan.  And then the women who were standing there, like, looking like, why are they making us  playing in this game?  I would assume Stuart Scott was for Zimmerman, right?  I don't think so.  I mean, against Zimmerman is what I'm trying to say. 
[01:01:00]  Yes, that is more...  Yeah.  So, obviously, wouldn't he consider him racist?  Would he consider...  Well, only half of Zimmerman.  He would consider half of Zimmerman probably racist.  The black, the Hispanic half.  The white half is racist.  Hispanic half can't be.  I would love to ask him about that.  Yeah.  Which half is the racist?  Because I'm sure he was all about, you know, Trayvon and all that.  So, did he look at Zimmerman as a racist?  We are all Trayvon.  And Zimmerman wasn't a white guy.  No. 
[01:01:30]  Hmm.  Hmm.  All right.  Back to Wheel of Fortune.  Yeah.  So, this was yesterday.  Yep.  And Trent had a great time.  Didn't win much money.  Was he excited to be there?  He was very excited to be there.  I think one of the women won $10,000 and change.  Another woman won $12,000 and change.  And I think he won $2,000.  Why didn't they let him win?  Well, he was trying.  Yeah, but...  And every answer must have been at the tip of his tongue.  Because he was...  The woman would give the answer out and he'd go like, oh. 
[01:02:00]  Really?  He was all disappointed.  Like, I had that one.  But, you know, guys like Trent...  Yeah.  They, you know, all of a sudden are given the ball.  Mm-hmm.  And they could go run for their touchdown.  Run with it.  So, why didn't they let him win Wheel of Fortune?  I don't think they let you win Wheel of Fortune.  I don't care who you are.  But Trent had...  Oh, Trent's...  I mean...  If parents want to do their children a favor,  if your children has any kind of mental handicap, 
[01:02:30]  any other hairstyle,  any other hairdo,  holy shit, Trent had the hairdo.  He had it.  The Moe Howard.  The Pete Rose.  I'll be honest with you.  I wake up with the hairstyle every morning.  Do you?  Yes, I do.  The hairstyle.  I do.  You know, I gussy myself up to get in here.  But, man, sleeping doesn't...  Oh, crazy. 
[01:03:00]  Doesn't hold a hurt on your hair when you wake up.  I got it in the morning.  I think most of us do.  He has that fucking...  It's shaved on the sides.  It's right across the fucking brow line with the bangs.  Right.  What the hell are you thinking?  All right, let's go with this.  Okay, our first toss-up is coming up.  It's worth $1,000.  And the category is phrase. 
[01:03:30]  Here we go.  Trent.  A smashing success.  Yes, sir.  All right, there's Trent.  Good job.  And then Trent would, like, bow down and...  Here we go.  Trent, you're on.  Yeah.  You want $1,000.  Thanks.  I can't even tell if my mic is working, but...  Well, that's okay.  We take care.  We have highly paid professionals who would take care of stuff like that.  From Peoria, Arizona.  From the hair. 
[01:04:00]  Right.  A big game show fan, and they tell me that you know everything there is to know about Wheel  of Fortune.  Well, pretty much anything, yeah.  Yeah?  Let me ask you...  Okay, let me try...  I'm going to try it.  This is...  Go ahead.  You don't know...  Can you name...  There have been a few.  Can you name a category that we used to have that we no longer have on the show?  Oh, Jesus.  Uh, please promise you won't cringe, Pat.  What is he...  Mega word!  Mega word!  He's killing.  It's the worst category we ever...  What's he doing?  Very long and obscure word.  They keep cutting away from him.  He's just shaking. 
[01:04:30]  You have two dogs?  Yep.  Mr. Maloonigans and...  Thank you.  Rosie.  One's a schnooter.  No.  All righties.  Guys, you have the same letter as the category, everybody.  And Trent.  You're going to start...  Sheet wheel of questions.  All right.  Spinning!  Yeah!  I can't believe the show's still on the air.  What a shitty spin.  I used to watch this when I was homesick from school.  Yeah.  It was the only time I watched.  So, that's going to be a $1,000 gamble.  You also have that wild card, which would be at stake. 
[01:05:00]  If you cared to take a look back there, 50-50 chance of 10 grand, but it could be a bankrupt.  Trent, what do you think?  Together, Pat?  All right.  All right.  One.  Oh, it's heavy.  Let me get it for you.  One, two.  Oh, I mean, is it bad news?  What do you think?  Oh, well, he obviously didn't win that.  No?  What was it?  No.  $10,000.  All right.  But he's got to win the puzzle to win it.  I call that good news.  You can't spin any of that, Trent, so you need to spin the wheel here. 
[01:05:30]  And I can't use it, so...  No.  All right.  Spinning!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Oh, bankrupt.  Well...  Well...  Well...  Yeah, I'll get that.  I can take your wild card.  Well, that's what's called starting fresh.  It's your turn.  And now this woman's got to be like, I'm playing...  I'm playing against the stand-up.  Oh, bankrupt.  You've got it, too!  Yeah, join number two.  Yay!  And now... 
[01:06:00]  900.  R!  There's an R!  Oh, R.  That's a bad letter.  I'd like to buy a vowel pad.  An E.  Uh-oh.  There's seven of them in that puzzle.  Is there a T?  I'd like to buy a der pad.  Kid tries to buy a seven.  Oh, bankrupt.  Okay, he's back up.  Oh, no.  Trent.  Come on, Trent.  Do this.  You can do this.  Come on, Trent. 
[01:06:30]  Three-fitty.  Three, please!  Four C's, yes, sir.  All right.  Yeah.  Come on, Trent.  That's one.  That's one.  Eight, please!  Let's see.  Two eights.  All right.  Here he is.  All right.  Carpeake.  I risk another spin.  Cream, cheese, coffee, cake!  That's it!  Cream, cheese, coffee, cake!  Yeah, what am I going to do with that?  He's like, uh...  Trent's having fun.  Like Rain Man. 
[01:07:00]  Someone's saying that Trent sounds like Lady Di.  Oh, yeah.  Looks like her, too.  Right.  Ah, well, you know, that's good for Trent.  Hey, he's a little hero.  Boy, does he shake his head a lot.  Yeah.  Trent is a little chubby.  He wears big, black, corn-rimmed glasses.  You know, get him some hipper glasses.  Get him a fucking haircut that doesn't look instantly like it belongs on the head of somebody with some issues, perhaps. 
[01:07:30]  What is with that fucking haircut?  I don't know.  It's like it's the barber.  It just goes, yeah, I know what to give him.  Could everybody use low maintenance?  He's just going to comb it and you don't want to do anything?  You think that's it?  All right.  All right.  At least that's something.  At least that's an explanation, perhaps.  Low maintenance.  Yeah.  But just shave his head, then.  That's low maintenance right there.  Sure.  Wow.  All right.  Well, good for him.  He enjoys the Wheel of Fortune and you've got to live out his dream of being on it. 
[01:08:00]  Finally being on the wheel.  I watched it last night because people were saying, oh, you've got to watch this.  Right.  So I tuned it in and, you know, what are you going to do?  But they had a, I guess it was the 6,000th show or something.  Yeah.  More than that, was it?  I think it's 6,000.  Yeah.  And they showed clips from the 3,000th show.  Oh.  And that Vanna was a lot younger.  Vanna's got to be what?  She's got to be fucking old lady. 
[01:08:30]  She started the show when we were kids.  Yeah.  How many years has Wheel of Fortune been on the air?  She's got to be five years at least.  She doesn't look bad.  She's 57 years old.  Wow.  She doesn't look bad.  Yeah, let me check out the elbows.  Put that early footage of her.  She was pretty hot.  And she was in, what, Playboy or something back in the day?  Right.  She showed her gage, didn't she?  She did all right in the Playboy.  She started in 82.  Wow.  82, yeah.  I was a kid.  Child of the 80s. 
[01:09:00]  Child of the 80s.  Right in my fucking wheelhouse.  I mean, like a kid?  Yep.  I was a kid, all right.  Let's say hi to Steve in Texas.  Steve.  Hey, I had a question for Anthony there.  Yeah.  Sure.  Under Stuart Scott's explanation of racism, the apartheid wouldn't be racist because the  ruling class was a minority.  Well, that's true.  There you go.  Well, did he say majority?  Mm-hmm.  He did say majority.  They held all the power, though, didn't they? 
[01:09:30]  Oh, boy.  It's just a stupid tweet.  That would be his excuse.  There's...  Yeah.  I like that.  There's a video online of some black woman walks into a store, and she's just yelling  at the people that they have a store in the black neighborhood, and they shouldn't even  own it.  Black people should own it.  And that her grandmother was a slave.  She's like, my grandmother was 104 years old.  She was a slave.  She...  It's like, oh, do the math.  That doesn't quite work out.  But it turns out the people in the store were white, but they were from South Africa. 
[01:10:00]  And then to have the black woman gone, you know, go back to your country.  It's like, she wants to send white people back to Africa.  It was just this weird whole thing of...  I gotta see that.  ...thing of...  Is it funny?  She was very...  It was like, yeah, some woman at a gas station or...  Let me take one more of these phone calls, because the Stuart Scott tweet is really dumb.  Jesse in Mexico, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey. 
[01:10:30]  I'm a private citizen, and if...  Go in with Stuart's rationale.  If I'm to insult a black man on race, so does that make me racist?  No.  I don't believe it does.  What's the voice?  Are you just...  What are you doing?  What are you doing with your voice?  You got a lisp?  It's just my natural way of talking.  Oh, I wasn't sure if you were, like, changing your voice.  Yeah.  Don't put fucking words in my mouth.  Oh.  Sounds like dentures. 
[01:11:00]  Punching out.  Yeah.  I think he was being wacky.  I don't know.  I mean, but a white guy that doesn't have any power, and he says racist shit...  Right.  ...is...  Isn't a racist.  ...according to Stuart Scott, then you're not a racist.  You're not a racist.  You're right.  You're right.  Yeah.  What is he talking about?  That works both ways, then.  Yeah.  If you don't run anything where you could use your power to be racist, then you're not  a racist.  Where's this woman with the neighborhood store?  Is the... 
[01:11:30]  She's a black woman.  Where did you find this video?  Of course it was online.  I think...  No, I think I actually found it on Facebook, but you never find it on Facebook.  There's too many videos on Facebook now to just search willy-nilly.  Right.  She was so angry.  Let me say...  I wouldn't even know what...  Oh, she was angry.  Yeah, if you put angry black woman in, a lot comes up.  Naomi Campbell is the first. 
[01:12:00]  There are a lot of angry black women on video.  Mm-hmm.  Let me tell you.  Ah, can't find it.  We'll find it at some juncture.  We should play the video of the reporter, though.  The shirtless guy, Sam.  Yes.  Shirtless guy.  Yeah.  This is very funny.  And quite ridiculous.  Yeah?  Yes.  I don't want to give it away.  I don't think I've seen this. 
[01:12:30]  You might not have.  I like a good tasering video, too.  We haven't had any of those lately.  No, you can really search them out.  All right, here we go.  Oh, there's reporters, you know, talking to a guy that's holding a dog and he's shirtless.  Well, they're in Los Angeles for the wildfires.  Sure, right.  Trying to grab somebody on the street.  So she grabs this guy, and she grabbed the wrong guy.  Oh, yeah?  Not really.  A guy with no shirt on who's holding a pug. 
[01:13:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Just ask the residents to stay inside.  Sir, do you live around here?  Yeah.  Wow, you're super pretty.  You want to go on a date sometime?  We're on the air live right now on East TLA, actually.  Do you live in one of these houses?  Are you evacuating?  I live down the street.  I was just checking out the fire.  What do you think of it?  It's pretty cool.  Cool.  I'd be really...  All I know is we've been talking to several people coming out of here, and they are really scared.  I mean, just looking at the fire, it...  They're not that scared. 
[01:13:30]  The guy's casually walking around with his dog.  He described the fire as cool.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  Yeah, but then she's got to do her job and pump this shit up.  Uh-huh.  That guy was not even close to scared.  No, you don't want that guy.  You want somebody that's panicking.  Yes.  You've got to show it as a...  There it is.  Oh, and you found the black one.  That's her.  Oh, shit.  She's sassy.  All right.  Let's see this.  You're a slave.  You're always a slave.  I don't care about that.  My grandmother lived 104. 
[01:14:00]  Do you know how long...  Here.  Right here.  My family and grandmother live, and she just died this year.  Okay.  She was a slave.  Okay.  You're right here in Stone Mountain.  You can go and you can see...  Who says that all ancestors want slaves?  Hold on.  I'm talking about in this country, they've built this country, and we don't get no reparations.  But y'all come over here.  Hold on.  McDonald's, okay, which is a very huge...  McDonald's.  That was a slow...  That was a small...  But they don't charge you for no water.  You come over here, you get all kinds of tax breaks, but then you charge us for the water? 
[01:14:30]  Are you serious?  We're the one that built the pipes under this building, baby.  Wait.  Come on, man.  We pay for it.  Slaves built the pipes?  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Just because the law doesn't make you right.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Slavery 104 years ago, by the way.  What happened?  What's the truth?  I didn't know that.  I didn't know that.  You're right.  You're not a slave.  You're not a slave.  My right.  I come from slavery.  No, you didn't.  We do too.  We're African, so we know.  You don't know where the fuck we're from.  Just because we're brown, dumb, stereotype.  Can you leave?  I'm going to get my African-American. 
[01:15:00]  Can you leave?  My parents were born in Africa, but good job.  We're African-American.  Thank you very much.  If you want to.  Our parents were born in Africa.  Okay, in Africa.  Yes.  In Africa, not African-American.  What the hell is African-American?  What does American mean?  Your ancestors were about over here.  No, it doesn't mean shit.  It doesn't make any sense.  Yes, it does.  No, it really doesn't.  That's what it does.  That's what it means.  You're African soldiers.  My dad.  My dad is a Nigerian, okay?  Okay?  For real.  My dad's from Uganda.  But my grandmother, my ancestry comes from slavery. 
[01:15:30]  My grandmother was here with slavery.  What's this got to do with anything?  I know she wasn't.  Who's yours?  Who's yours?  Who's yours?  I'm saying your ancestry.  Your ancestry.  Where are we from?  Your ancestry.  Don't catch you.  You're not from here.  Where is that?  You're not from here.  So where are we?  You're not from here.  Where are you from now?  Your mother, your mother's mother wasn't raised here.  My generation only go back one generation.  You know where my mother's mother is raised?  Why are you screaming?  Do you know where my mother's mother is raised?  She honestly thinks her grandmother was a slave. 
[01:16:00]  That's insane.  You think that, the only thing I'm saying is, y'all come over here and I'm saying y'all  because the majority, we can go in my community, I live in Latonia.  When I go in my community, it's not me that's owning it, okay?  When I go to the nail shop, it's like the man said, it's the Vietnamese.  Try to run a business.  People don't want to work.  People don't want to work.  But they come over here, you own an Indian.  Look how fat she is too.  She's fucking fat.  The Indian is coming over here, they own a hotel.  She's shoving food in her face. 
[01:16:30]  That's what, but I'm asking you, why is there an industry of you?  Who has opened the market to you?  Those people that want jobs.  People that want jobs.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Hold on, hold on.  If you go back, go all the way back, okay?  At one point in time, it was us that owned it, okay?  In our own communities.  You got to go back in our history of who we were.  Hold on, but let me tell you, when crack was brought into our communities, it broke up  our families.  Ah, crack was brought in and broke up the families.  But you wreaked the repercussions and you wreaked the benefits of crack being brought into 
[01:17:00]  our communities.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  It's a system.  Why are you screaming at me?  Because you don't understand it's your system.  No, you don't understand it's your system.  This is a fucking mentality that's out there.  I don't give a fuck.  You go to the back.  You go to the back.  This blood ain't alone.  You go to the back.  You get alone.  You get a gas station.  Excuse me.  Let me ask you why I can't get alone.  Why?  And I'm supposed to be a...  Why the hell?  What was...  What was...  What is it called?  I don't even know.  Oh, God.  Why can't you get alone?  Something about affirmative action. 
[01:17:30]  Why was affirmative action here?  Because you're so fucking smart.  And you know some motherfucking everything.  And you think that our black people, we just can't own shit.  And we don't want to be a part of our own shit in our own community.  What was your own shit in our community?  Imagine her walking into a bank and asking for a loan.  I give it to her.  And sounding like this ignorant fucking cunt that she is.  Could you imagine the banker saying, sure.  I'll give you some money.  Sure.  No.  No.  Tell her grandmother was a slave. 
[01:18:00]  Because of the system, you mean?  Because of the system.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, it keeps going.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She just goes.  And she just wants free water?  She wants free water.  That's what she wants.  How do you get free water these days?  I don't know.  She came in and wanted free water.  And why would you want...  Where does she want the water from?  A gas station.  Oh, my God.  Who would drink that?  I don't know.  Go out to the fucking hose that they fill the radiators with.  Meanwhile, her fucking mouth is getting dry from yelling like... 
[01:18:30]  From yelling.  You get that dry mouth.  So what?  She came in and said, I want free water?  Yeah.  Why?  But because white people own the store, they weren't giving it to her because they're racist.  But they're more African than she is.  Yeah.  Keep going with this thing.  All right.  Hit her.  Oh, my God.  This was done.  Oh, no.  On the black community.  Why we don't own this?  You're right.  Why we don't own this?  Why we don't own a hair store down the street?  That's your fault.  You know what I'm about? 
[01:19:00]  I want to own a hair store.  Well, guess what?  When I get ready to go trying to own a hair store, who controls the industry?  The Chinese, they got to sell it to us.  The Chinese.  But they don't want to sell to us.  Who's talking about?  No, no, no.  It's not our fault.  You have to have opened up opportunities, which is an open market.  Okay?  Okay.  My thing is...  The opened up opportunities, which is the open market.  Who's going to come?  Who's going to come?  Where are you from?  Just understand what I'm saying.  Go do something.  She comes back.  You don't know where the fuck I'm from, motherfucker. 
[01:19:30]  You don't know where I'm from.  Go back to your country.  Go back to your country.  Go back to your country.  Make your money.  Go back to your country.  Go back to your country.  Why do you think there aren't a lot of black-owned businesses in black communities? 
[01:20:00]  Look at this woman.  You think she could run a business?  Try it.  Try it.  Try it.  Try it.  I want to see your face in the AGC tomorrow.  Fuck you, bitch.  Okay.  Fuck you, bitch.  Come back to your country.  That's fine, because I'm still going to be here, and you're still going to be in your situation.  Get out of the black community.  This is my life.  Get out of the black community.  Excuse me.  Go back to your home.  This is private property. 
[01:20:30]  Look at that fire hydrant shape she's got.  No, we own it.  Well, sell it to us and go back home.  No, thank you.  Sell it to us.  It's making me mind.  Let us get alone.  Let us get alone.  Go home.  If she owned that place, if they sold it to her, it would be open for a week.  I do love the way the guys are just filming her and just kind of laughing at her.  Oh, yeah.  We ain't got this.  Don't have change.  Get a job.  Why?  We got a little section, ain't it, bitch.  Why?  Fuck you.  Why?  Check the fuck off when this kid's wrong number.  Hey.  No.  No. 
[01:21:00]  Oh.  Okay.  So what, she came in with her own cup to get water?  Yeah.  Yeah, she came in with a cup to get water.  Who does that?  Yep.  Somebody that wants a problem.  Oh, wow.  I love that, though.  It's like, go back to your country.  It's Africa.  It's Africa.  That's just a fun video.  That is a fun video.  I loved that one.  It doesn't bother me or anything.  It's just a fun video.  The thing is, it's that mindset.  I've seen that.  That's not a one-off. 
[01:21:30]  That woman, if it's just one crazy woman, you're like, ah, ha, ha.  But that mindset and that ignorance and that lack of knowledge about your own fucking past,  that gets used in discussions and arguments and whatnot on race and business.  It's just ridiculous.  Could you imagine her trying to run anything with that fucking attitude?  Good luck to you.  Where was that?  Looked like a very nice store. 
[01:22:00]  The store looked nice.  Oh, was it one of those mini-marts, gas stations, 10 places?  Yeah, that's what it looked like.  Yeah.  Mini-mart.  World Star Hip Hop?  Yeah, and it was World Star.  That's who posted it.  World Star.  I love the World Star.  When are we starting World Star Rock and Roll?  Yeah.  I think we got something there.  I really do.  Well, it's hard to find thousands of videos of thousands of people doing horrible things.  A lot of fighting on World Star.  No, it's a lot of fighting.  Not one-on-one either. 
[01:22:30]  One guy punches one guy, and then five guys kick him and stomp his head and try to kill him, literally kill him.  Could you imagine?  I could imagine fighting.  I can't imagine the guy falling down and then stomping on their skull without knowing there is a real potential here of killing this person and going to prison.  Like, you'd think that would flash through your head to not do that.  Yeah, you'd knock him out.  You'd fucking put him down.  I don't know what the reason for the fight is.  Whatever. 
[01:23:00]  But then to continue stomping on a person's head, it's just bizarre.  Let's go to Mike in Florida.  Mikey.  Hey, guys.  I've liked the show for years, and I kind of agree with what Ant says, but I just say that I'm just disappointed and saddened by the lack of success economically with the black community.  I'm not really angry about it, and I don't really think Ant is either.  I think the better word is we're just kind of disappointed that they haven't done better. 
[01:23:30]  Well, it's frustrating, and it's an economic drain.  So, yeah, you know, when you see all this tax money that we spend going to these programs that do nothing, throwing money at things like education when the United States pays more in education than any nation in the world,  and throwing money isn't, that isn't the fucking solution.  That isn't the solution.  The only thing makes me happier than seeing a successful black entrepreneur, and, you know, that makes it through hard work. 
[01:24:00]  And so, but I'm not angry about the people that don't.  I'm just kind of sad for them.  Yeah.  And that's all I've got to say.  He's sad.  You're sad.  Aw.  Buck up there, champ.  Aw.  Got Bob Kelly at 8.30, Cindy Kane at 8.30.  I guess we've got to look at this amazing wrestling promo as well.  What?  I would if I were you.  From Big Papa Pump.  Scott Steiner. 
[01:24:30]  Well, there's this thing now.  Oh, and we've got the Shaq thing, too.  Shit.  Shaq balloon?  Well, remember yesterday we started the apology clock?  Oh, yeah.  And what, we're going to try to go 10 days without someone apologizing?  Uh-oh, we didn't make it one day?  No.  Shaq is apologizing for a retard face.  He made a face mocking a man with obvious mental and physical problems.  Shaq apologizes.  What's the headline there, Sam?  Bottle doodle? 
[01:25:00]  The headline is Shaq apologizes for mocking disabled fans' selfie.  They should have said retard face.  Oh, boy.  Shaq apologizes for a retard face.  It's the R word.  You don't say that.  True.  He tweeted saying, made a new friend today when I called and apologized to Jamel Binion.  Great dude.  He seems like a great dude.  Great dude.  Had the opportunity to talk to Jamel Binion yesterday and apologize about the post on Instagram. 
[01:25:30]  What did he, I wonder what he said.  This is Shaq.  I'm sorry.  Yo, this is Shaq.  I made a stupid face.  I'm sorry.  That's the great conversation.  Yeah.  What could he say?  Like, I apologize.  And then did he have to tell him what he was thinking?  Right.  You was making a stupid face, too.  But I didn't realize that you were, uh, you know.  I didn't realize you wasn't making a face.  Right.  Like, my face, I was making a face.  That is your face.  I learned that it is your face. 
[01:26:00]  See, you wake up in the morning, you look at that face.  I just make that face.  I make that face.  And then I stop making a face.  I'm Shaq.  I was being funny, but you was being you.  Yeah.  Right.  You were being funny looking.  I was being funny.  And now that I know that's how you really look, I apologize.  I apologize.  How do you do, how do you make that apology?  Yeah.  You got, because you got to say, here's what I was thinking.  Right.  I was thinking that you were making funny face. 
[01:26:30]  I thought you were making funny face.  So I decided to make my funny face.  But now I see that you continue to make that funny face.  You don't stop making the face.  Right.  That's your face.  It's made.  That's a tough apology.  Oh, that's a rough one.  Oh, Shaq.  I just didn't realize.  Didn't realize.  I didn't realize that your upper lip never goes down.  Oh. 
[01:27:00]  I would do it to buck teeth, but.  Buck teeth face.  Your teeth is buck normal.  Crinkly nose and the one shut eye.  That's, for me, that's a funny face.  For you, it's a face.  For you, it's a Tuesday.  It's a Tuesday.  Oh, Shaq.  The photo has been belated.  I belated the photo of me making funny face at your face.  Anything else on the article? 
[01:27:30]  Did he invite him to a game or something?  He probably threw a lot of money at him or something.  No, and then they just go into the story.  That fucking bulbous head of his, wow.  Well, I mean.  That is bizarre.  Not a pleasant looking head.  No.  Shaq's been in studio.  I like Shaq, but he's kind of stupid.  How did he not know?  Yeah.  How did he not know?  Oh, my God.  And was it like one of his friends sent him that and said, don't Shaq, check this shit  out?  No one's explaining it.  I don't know.  Yeah, like how did he get his hands on it? 
[01:28:00]  He probably just found it.  Maybe Waka Flocka sent it to him.  Waka Flocka.  Waka Flocka.  Check out this motherfucker.  Check out this motherfucker's funny face.  He thought it was just a meme and didn't realize that everybody knows who Shaq is, so obviously  this is going to get back to that kid.  Did Waka Flocka apologize, too?  I don't think so.  Why isn't Waka Flocka Flav apologizing?  Because it's flame.  Waka Flocka Flav.  Because Waka Flocka doesn't apologize to nobody.  Oh, all right.  All right, then.  So we went one day. 
[01:28:30]  One day.  So we've got to restart the apology clock.  Restart it.  Restart it.  And we're only going to 10.  That's the clock.  Yeah.  10 days.  Yeah.  I mean, with the wrestling thing, 100 days, but I don't think we go more than 10 days.  People have thrown out apologies like crazy.  And is this just in the United States, or is this everywhere?  U.S., I think you've got to keep it.  Mostly U.S., but if it's a big international story.  Yeah, because what if it's like Rob Ford?  Yeah, Rob Ford would certainly fit the criteria.  Okay.  He actually owes one. 
[01:29:00]  Yes.  He'll be apologizing today for his behavior.  So we'll reset the apology clock.  Oh, I guarantee we reset it tomorrow again.  So that leads us to the Scott Steiner wrestling promo we did with a wrestling fan.  Yeah, well, the thing is that, like, these wrestling conventions that the old wrestlers  go to, they now do so many of them.  Like, you're good for a convention every three months, and it's the only place these guys  can make any money.  Sure.  Signing autographs.  But it's always the same people going to them.  Virgil.  Right. 
[01:29:30]  And it's always the same fans going to them.  So everybody's like, I got his autograph, I'm not paying for it.  Right.  So they're trying to figure out new ways to make money.  Oh, good idea.  So for, like, somewhere between 30 and 50 bucks, they set up a video camera, and you  can cut a promo with a wrestler.  Right.  And so Scott Steiner shows up, who's known for his just promos that mean nothing.  Like, just shouting words.  I was a big fan of his.  Yeah.  He made me laugh. 
[01:30:00]  He was funny on the mic.  Wow.  By the way, why didn't they give that lady the water?  Is it explained?  Um, I don't know.  Maybe she came and goes, give me water, motherfucker.  Because it's not one of those things where every other person is asking for water, so you  get to the point where, like, no, we're just not giving water out.  Yeah.  It's very rare that you see someone actually ask for water.  Yeah, I, I...  And why wouldn't they just give her the water?  Who knows what a cunt she was acting like before that.  Maybe she was being a real twat.  She comes in with her cup, though, and asks for water. 
[01:30:30]  We got water.  Yeah, we got water.  But it wasn't explained in that video?  No.  I'm just wondering.  All right, let's play this video.  But yeah, if you ever get a...  If I'm not in a Mike Francesa YouTube loop, I'm in a Scott Steiner YouTube loop.  Oh, wow.  All right, let's see.  Ready?  Ready?  Right.  That's how he looks nowadays?  Yeah.  Jesus.  He still wears the chain mail.  You thought he would have fallen off by now.  No, dude, he's still...  I mean, you know, who knows how he's keeping his physique up. 
[01:31:00]  How is he keeping that physique?  Yeah.  If you don't know him, he's the one that's just ridiculously ripped.  You may know him as the, uh...  Big Papa Pomp.  Big Bad Booty Daddy.  Right.  We've played his audio over the years.  Oh, yeah.  His shit is funny.  It's insane.  Is he wrestling?  Uh, he'll do indie shows, like high school gym shows.  Yeah, he doesn't have an ounce of fat on him, still.  No, none.  All right.  He has chain mail hair.  Yes, he wears the chain mail thing that they wore under armor all the time.  Right, but it's his hair, like...  Yeah, that's his thing. 
[01:31:30]  His head is shaved, right?  He's been known for that.  Yeah, that's great.  Ready?  Harlem Heat!  Booker T!  Stevie Ray!  You hurt my brother!  You put him in the hospital!  And I had to go to Parts Unknown and find a new partner.  Well, I found that partner in Smith Toticle.  Come on in here, boy.  Tell him what we're going to do.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  You're talking about Trent on the Wheel of Fortune.  Wow.  There's everything wrong with this guy. 
[01:32:00]  This guy is hugely fat.  With a horrendous pencil mustache.  Terrible mustache.  Pencil-thin mustache.  He's a ginger.  And he almost looks like he has a comb-over, but I can't really tell.  Is he a ginger?  Yeah, there's ginger going on there.  Dark.  Very dark ginger.  He's got rosy cheeks.  He's got a full head of hair comb-over.  Comb-over.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  It's really strange.  He's very overweight.  Oh.  Very overweight.  What would you estimate his weight at?  Uh, I don't know.  350? 
[01:32:30]  I would say 400 pounds.  Okay.  Chubsy-ubsy.  He looks like Chubsy-ubsy.  Big Papa's at least 220, I would assume, right?  He's bigger than, yeah, he's bigger than Big Papa Pump.  Oh, God.  And Big Papa Pump is like...  He's pushing 400, I would say.  He's, like, really doing the promo, yelling and stuff.  And then he calls for this guy to come in and he just lumbers...  Lumbers in from the side.  ...like a fan.  Hi.  Oh, God.  I'm here.  He's a new partner.  Yeah.  This is how bad it's gotten for the wrestlers.  He's got a big fat guy shirt on.  Yeah, yeah.  These wrestlers should have a... 
[01:33:00]  Just smock.  ...have a 401 or something.  Oh, no.  Why are they doing this shit?  He's got to get it, yeah, between 30 and 50 bucks.  You can't be happy that he's doing this.  So there's a bunch of people online and it's like, all right, here's the promo.  Can everybody hear the promo that you're making as you make it?  Yeah, I mean, it's not an impression.  Have you done one of these with one of your wrestlers?  No.  Why not?  Oh, come on.  You've got to do it.  I make...  Yeah, maybe I should just do it for the goof.  That'd be great.  You have to do one of these.  All right, next time they do it, I'll do it for the show.  So over and over again, they step in front of the camera with him and do the promo,  and then they take the tape home with him? 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, it's like...  Then what do they do with the tape?  They put it on YouTube.  Oh, God.  It gets laughed at by radio shows.  And they watch it while no one is fucking them again.  I'm sure he put it online and he was all proud of it.  Oh, yeah.  Now we have to mock this.  Yeah, he's got a whole series of them, but this is the one good one.  All right.  You know who else is doing these?  Huh?  Our pal Mick.  Mick Foley?  Really?  But he doesn't...  Mick doesn't need the money.  He's just cheap.  He loves...  He's a cheap fuck.  He's cheap.  He wants to make it while he still can.  He's smart. 
[01:34:00]  Uh-huh.  All right.  Back to Scott Steiner and his new tag team partner.  Come on in here, boy.  Tell them what we're going to do.  Stevie Ray and Booker T.  You know what?  We're going to take you out before you even get to the ring.  We're going to go out drinking, partying, getting up and having all the fun with all the hot ladies.  Fuck you.  Oh!  He's not good.  We can't do it.  Oh!  I'm so...  Are you embarrassed?  I'm douche...  I'm douche chilling out. 
[01:34:30]  Oh!  He's not good.  Jim, you're not a giant wrestling fan.  What do you think?  Wow!  I don't think he's very good at this.  You don't?  No, I don't think he's very convincing.  We're going to go out partying and drinking and the ladies...  Oh!  Oh!  The ladies...  Oh, God.  And his boys, he tried to come in all powerful and everything.  He's got nothing.  You come in powerful, but then you don't know what you're going to say next.  Then you don't know what you're going to say.  Like, he knew he needed energy.  Right.  But that's all he thought of.  No confidence, though.  Let's hear from his beginning again. 
[01:35:00]  He needs to hear.  From when he walks in.  And you see that they're off-centered and had to move the camera.  Yeah, yeah.  But the guy has to look straight ahead.  The wrestling guy has to look straight ahead like it's a legit thing for the video.  Right.  All right.  Here we go.  Stevie Ray and Booker T.  You know what?  We're going to take you out before you even get to the ring.  We're going to go out drinking, partying, get up and have all the fun with all the hot ladies.  Fuck you, women.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:35:30]  Good.  There's plenty of fucking going on tonight.  Oh, what is he...  That's his dream.  Him and the wrestlers getting some girls together.  Yes.  And plenty of fucking going on tonight.  Oh, this is not a promo like I hear on WWE.  That's smooth.  Wow.  You never heard them leading up to a big pay-per-view with some overweight guy saying,  plenty of fucking going on.  Plenty of fucking going on.  No. 
[01:36:00]  I think Scott Steiner's messing with him.  Is he?  I think so.  To God.  Drinking, partying, getting up and having all the fun with all the hot ladies.  Fuck you, women.  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead.  Plenty of fucking going on tonight.  And guess what?  We're going to screw you over.  We're going to give you all the nasty ass leftovers.  And they're going to...  Then what we're going to do?  We're going to fuck the women again.  We're going to fuck them again.  But guess what?  All those nasty women, we just gave you a bunch of STDs. 
[01:36:30]  So you're so weak, we're going to just beat your ass in the ring, break your legs, count  one, two, three, and this is for you, Rick.  We're going to bury them.  You got STDs.  Scott Steiner just looked at him and he goes, you got STDs.  He just paid all this money for a promo.  What does the women have to do with them?  We're going to go in the ring and... 
[01:37:00]  He said he's going to weaken the opponents by giving them STDs.  What is he saying?  The women are going to give them STDs.  Right.  He's going to...  But his logic is they're going to fuck the women and then the women will have STDs.  And then they'll pass it on and then they'll be weak in the ring for the one, two, three.  But that means he has an STD.  Right, of course.  And that's why Scott Steiner said, you have STDs?  I don't...  Why are you trying to figure this out?  How much did he pay for this?  Between 30 and 50 bucks.  Probably 50 because Scott Steiner stole a good name.  50 bucks.  And like Scott knows you paid 50 and instead of going with it, you got STDs too. 
[01:37:30]  Why don't we do that one day?  50 bucks, you get to do the radio show for a minute with us.  Oh, man.  Yeah, we'll throw a topic out there and let him fucking riff.  We'll film it and you can bring it home with you.  Part of the Opie and Anthony show.  We should do that.  You know what would be fun?  Yes.  Are we on the same?  If one of our own people did a wrestling promo?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think the E-Rock would be very good at doing a wrestling promo.  Can E-Rock do one of these at a convention?  I had a different idea.  Oh. 
[01:38:00]  My convention, pal.  Lyle Tripperson did it.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  Have you fun?  Fuck, yeah.  We're going to knock you guys so senseless you're not going to have any sense.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'd chip could do it.  That would be a...  An E-Rock.  You got it.  E-Rock's the way it was.  That's the gag.  Maybe Bobo.  Oh, God.  Just bring my whole gang up.  Right.  Those dumb details from the show that even we don't know. 
[01:38:30]  Talking to girls on the bus.  I'm going to go to the...  Why are you talking about this?  Do the Bobos have a birthday?  It was the Bobo's birthday.  Happy birthday, Bobo.  Hopefully it's last four.  Was it yesterday or something?  Yeah.  All right.  Happy birthday.  Yeah, the little Bobo.  All right.  And they're going to...  Then what we're going to do?  We're going to fuck the women again.  We're going to fuck them again.  But guess what?  All those nasty women, we just gave you a bunch of STDs.  So you're so weak, we're going to just beat your ass in the ring, break your legs, count one, two, three. 
[01:39:00]  And this is for you, Rick.  We're going to bury them.  Oof.  Oh, hell, not me.  I'm going to give them that.  They have STDs, really?  Yeah, but if you got STDs, you've got to give it to them.  No.  You can't have not have STDs and not give it to them.  All right.  No, hell, no.  You just tell them what girls you're fucking and I'll stay away from them.  No, no.  We fucked the pretty ones.  They fucked the ugly ones, remember?  The ugly ones have the STDs.  Oh, Jesus.  Is this guy...  Look at T, Steven Ray, you guys are going down. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, he has nothing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's pretty funny.  That guy had nothing.  Oh.  Like, if you're going to get online, pay 50 bucks to stand there and then...  And then do a promo, wouldn't you think, like, oh, I've faked it before.  I've done these.  I've riffed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, what...  Not like, okay, here's the 50.  Okay, let me think of something. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  Let me think of something.  Now, you know, bring up wrestler names.  Yeah.  Hey, you, guy.  But instead, he's just like, I'm going to follow Scott Steiner's lead, and Scott Steiner's  leading him down into terrible roads.  Nothingness.  Yeah.  There's going to be a whole lot of fucking going on.  Yeah.  He was really bad.  You've got to watch it.  It's on...  If you look up Scott Steiner fan promo, it's also on ONA Show on Twitter.  Perfect.  With that, we've got to take a break.  Bob Kelly joins us next.  Nice.  And is Santa Cain here?  She should be.  All right. 
[01:40:30]  All right.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  The gentleman...  You're jamming me.  Oh, there it is.  Bob Kelly in studio.  He's playing Harris in Atlantic City tonight.  Harris with Nick DiPaolo.  The great Nick DiPaolo.  Nice.  Nice.  Very cool.  That's a nice bill right there.  Tickets should be good.  Tickets are going, yeah.  So you'll get some Harris tonight, and then...  And I had to follow him, too.  Right.  It's a fucking nightmare.  I don't know.  I think I'm allergic to you.  You're playing the Stress Factory this weekend. 
[01:41:00]  Friday, Saturday.  And the last time you played locally, I had every intention of seeing you, because I haven't  seen you in a while, and I was sick.  And I got a dumb allergy attack or a cold today.  Yeah.  So I'm hoping maybe it'll get better so I can see you at the Stress Factory.  Stress Factory is a good club, as long as you don't mind going up after the owner who does  75 minutes in front of you, of fucking new jokes that fly.  I've never had...  He doesn't even do that. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, because you have a fucking nine-foot fucking asshole from Jersey going, you're not going  on before him.  No, he's not even there half the time.  Yeah, but...  He'll be out there on the gigs.  He loves Vinny.  I love Vinny, but he's actually cool, because I'm doing my special...  He takes pride in his place.  ...June 17th at the Village Underground.  I'm doing my special.  Oh, you shouldn't...  Ah!  For you.  Yeah, so we're going to do it.  We're going to run it this weekend.  I fucking hate my act.  Why?  I get to the point where I get sick of it, too.  Not you, but mine.  Oh, man.  Do you really?  I just get sick of it.  You write shit. 
[01:42:00]  You're very topical in the last couple of years, too, which is great.  You know, you'll bring...  I'm sure the radio helps.  Anytime you do this show for a couple days, all of a sudden, there's something that opens  up creatively.  Yeah.  Like, on stage, because you have to look at these papers and come up with shit.  Yeah, you kind of get hip on the news.  You know what's going on.  What about the podcast?  That should happen to you.  Let's do your podcast for Riotcast.  Podcast for Riotcast.  Nice.  Nice.  I like that. 
[01:42:30]  We don't really get too topical on my show.  You just fuck her up.  I haven't done your show in a while.  What's that about?  Come down.  All right.  We're redoing the studio.  Nice.  We're going to redo the Riotcast studio above the comedy.  Do I have to do the podcast with 80 guys again?  How many do you want to do it?  Like me, you.  Who else?  Me, you.  Oh, you want to do a one-on-one.  Me, you.  I do the special one-on-one series.  Oh, that's nice.  I don't want a special one-on-one series.  Yeah, a little uncomfortable for you?  Not really.  You want Dan Soda? 
[01:43:00]  Dan would be all right.  How about a Louis J. Gomez?  He's all right.  He's a very funny guy.  First time I did it, it was me, you, DeRosa, and Soda.  It was perfect.  Four guys.  That's a good one.  I like four.  Yeah.  Let's go with four guys.  You got it.  Four guys.  And one chick.  I didn't even have a seat.  We were all sitting on each other's laps because that space is so tiny.  Last time I did your podcast, there was one, two, three, four, five, six.  At least eight.  Yeah, eight people.  Maybe nine.  I know.  I have a lot here.  Wow, really?  Yeah, yeah.  I can do eight people on this.  I think you're fighting for mic time, right?  It's very, it gets, well, it gets very like the table. 
[01:43:30]  Like I wanted a career, like a comic.  I understand what you're going for.  It works.  A comic hang, but sometimes you can do it.  No, Bob wants us to control a group of people.  All right, go ahead, dude, you, dude, you.  You, next.  Bob wants to have like a small kingdom of people that he rolls over.  It's funny, though.  Certain, most people know how to do, like I had to learn how to do radio.  Like you learn to shut the fuck up.  You know what I mean?  But it's hard when somebody's attacking you.  You want to talk over them.  Right, right.  And certain, like I had Link Hoplitz on the other day.  You got to hit her in the head with a frying pan to get her to shut up in between people. 
[01:44:00]  That's good.  And it's just that, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Stop.  I think we got to talk about Jenny Hutt for a second.  What's going on with her?  She's exhausting is what she is.  She is fucking exhausting.  Do you know who Jenny Hutt is?  Exhausting.  No, who is that?  We kind of like her, but she's also kind of needy and stuff.  She's that redhead that runs around here.  Yeah.  She's on CNN occasionally.  And she's got a fiery red bush, according to Anthony.  No, I want to see her fiery red bush.  Or you want her to grow it back in, right?  But she lasered it off. 
[01:44:30]  So they got like nothing down there.  Yeah, great.  Now you get to just see the blood pumping into it.  Like it's a heart.  It sucks.  I hate redheads.  Do you really?  I'm not a, look, redhead, I get it, but I just, I don't, I don't like how pale the skin  is down there.  You can see the root of the hair.  You know what I mean?  Like even when they shave, you can see the root hole.  It's like, blech.  The root hole.  Just a big, just some artery just flowing into it. 
[01:45:00]  I just like the fact that it's, uh, it's rare.  It's like the white tiger.  It's like, you know, it's not every, every girl is pretty much dark hair.  Even some blondes.  It's surprising.  It's like, Hey, a blonde is brown down here.  What happened?  Does that fucking work?  But a redhead is like, ah, the fiery red bush.  I want to see it.  It's not that good, dude.  It looks like somebody poured like ketchup on it.  Well, I've seen some before, but I just, you know, I'll always take the opportunity 
[01:45:30]  to look again.  Right.  I like seeing that.  So she's got, you know, the red hair and everything.  So I assumed the red bush and then she's like, no, I had it all lasered off.  It doesn't even leave you any options.  Are you sure it's, she's a redhead though?  Cause a lot of girls, she's a redhead.  She's a definite redhead.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She dyes her hair.  I know that.  I'm surprised like more girls aren't have red.  You know, like when a guy will grow a beard, he has like blonde.  But then I'll grow a beard and it's like red.  Red beard.  Yeah.  Red beard. 
[01:46:00]  Like, I'm surprised it doesn't happen down there with their box.  Maybe it does.  Like some blonde girls have like big red bush or something.  Just a big red bush and it gets lighter towards the tip from the being out.  I got red pubes.  Let's see.  Let me see.  What's he doing?  What do you got?  Oh my God.  What is that?  Red pubes.  Sort of red.  Like in carrot top down there.  You have a tranny belly.  Oh God.  I have lost weight recently.  So Jenny Hut.  You have a smooth stomach, dude. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, I shaved it.  Yeah.  You have like a little smooth stomach.  You shave your belly?  I shave the whole thing.  Do you really?  I got twink.  I get a...  No, and then I let it grow in a little bit.  Oh my God.  Because my chest hair just continues to grow.  It doesn't stop growing.  Right.  It would be this long.  Like an Asian guy's face.  It's ridiculous.  Now it's going to grow back even more because you shave it.  Yeah.  I've been doing it for years.  I think you've got to trim it down a little bit.  No, no.  I don't have that coarse shit.  Thank God.  Look at it.  Look at it. 
[01:47:00]  It's pretty smooth right now.  It's got to grow in a little bit.  What are you shaving?  Just a razor?  An electric razor.  Just trim it all the way down.  It's usually in the winter and then let it grow back a little bit.  How long does it take?  Not long.  It grows out of control.  Sometimes I...  I've got hair on my shoulders.  It's probably this high.  Are you kidding me?  It just keeps growing.  Wow.  You know some guys that are really hairy but you know their hair just decided to stop?  Mine doesn't for whatever reason. 
[01:47:30]  Wow.  Yeah, Lenny Marcus, the comedian, very funny guy.  I remember we were doing a festival together and I went to his room during the day and he  had no shirt on.  He's a werewolf.  Yeah, some people really.  Like from the neck down.  Hairy shoulders and his back.  Mine's patchy though too so there's no rhyme or reason to it so it's better to just kind  of keep it all trimmed.  Steve C, he had a massive amount of hair.  He was one of those that they had to decide where the beard was going to stop to stop shaving 
[01:48:00]  because it's like, all right, I guess my beard stops here and then it turns into chest,  neck hair.  I don't know.  How far down should you go?  Do you shave your arms?  No.  See, I have to shave my, look, you can see it on my arms.  I haven't done it in a while.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  It just keeps growing.  Yeah, that's weird.  I stopped shaving.  Can you, look at it.  Look, you have no hair.  Like, mine just continues to, it just continues to grow.  I've got to trim it down all the time.  It's because the alcohol killed the roots. 
[01:48:30]  I'm glad I didn't come out one of those real hairy Italian fucking guys.  Yeah, I've got a lot of hair on my arms too.  Yeah, you're going to do it.  And I go into these, if I shave like my chest, I just keep going sometimes.  Yeah.  I just keep, I get addicted to the buzz.  Really?  Yeah, I'm just digging in my ass trying to get out.  I go nuts when I shave.  I shave my arms.  I shave my titties.  I've shaved everything.  Really?  There's just a pile of hair in the bathroom. 
[01:49:00]  On the floor.  You supposed to pick that up or is that the maid's job?  You think you're supposed to pick up most of it?  I leave it out my window and hope a bird's going to make a nest out of it.  A big red, you just see a red nest in the tree.  Oh, boy, does it pile up.  Wow.  I'll take a picture next time I do the complete shave down.  Two sparrow eggs and a fucking red bush.  I've got to do the legs too.  No, you don't.  But you've got to be careful with that.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  No, not down to skin.  Relax.  What do you do with anything?  I have to.  I'm telling you, I've got this hair. 
[01:49:30]  That's cool.  You shave your legs.  It's fine.  You don't know what a man is shaving his legs and belly.  It just continues to grow.  There's nothing wrong with a man who shaves his legs and belly.  Yeah, it's fine.  Nothing wrong with that.  You want to smooth up for the summer.  I understand.  I have to.  Legs, though.  Hatching shit.  No, I don't really care if a guy's legs are hairy.  No, the leg's not as much.  But, I mean, the hair will get really long on the legs, too.  Can I say something?  All those guys.  Dana White shaves everything.  He shaves his arms.  He changes his legs.  He's fucking Dana White, though.  Yeah, that's true.  He also trains him to jigsaw.  Right.  Roll around on the mat, so. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, probably less hair, the better, if you're rolling around with another man.  Yeah, but a lot of guys shave everything.  I do the summer shave, though.  Just get it all nice.  Twice a year, maybe.  You know, and then maybe a late fall, and then that's it.  Getting caught shaving your legs by your wife.  Oh, boy.  You got to be careful.  No, it's more of a trim down, to be honest.  The razor.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  The electric.  Yeah, with a thing on it, so it doesn't go too short.  The thing.  You don't foam your legs up.  One of those things.  You don't foam your legs up.  No!  Do you put one leg up on the bench?  So what do you use to exfoliate your legs with, Oph? 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  What kind of lotion afterwards?  What scent?  What kind of bath do you take?  Yeah.  I like taking a good bath.  You do not!  You like a good bath?  Absolutely.  A bath?  I don't know why.  What the fuck?  I come from a bath family.  Oh, you put oils in there?  I soak.  No way.  I turn my whole body lobster red.  Do you understand a bath is the shittiest thing in the world?  That's like shitting in a hole.  No, because I don't like standing.  So get a bench like a man.  You know what I get in my new shower? 
[01:51:00]  I lay in the water and I check my numbers on my phone or read a little book for a little  bit.  Oh, my God.  You're a fucking divorced woman.  Then I rinse off with a shower and I'm good.  Do you have an Opie candle?  Divorced woman.  I do take more baths than my wife.  Are you shitting me?  Every day.  Every day.  Wow.  Every day I go in for a soak.  Wow.  I rip my bath out in the new house.  It's gone.  I put a walk-in shower that four guys can stand tummy to tummy, tip to tip in. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  And you thought that out.  And then I got a bench.  And this time I put a shower over the bench.  It's own shower head.  So when you sit on the bench, you don't have to turn the thing towards you.  Yeah.  You have your own shower massage head right over your body.  I like to soak.  That is...  Here's what my...  You say Japanese soaking tub.  I like to soak.  People can't tell you.  Here's what the tub is for.  And this is the only time I've ever taken a bath. 
[01:52:00]  It's a prelude to sex.  You fill up the tub.  You pour in an entire bottle of Mr. Bubble.  You get a bottle of wine and a couple of glasses.  You get in there with a, you know, a good friend.  And crank the jacuzzi motor up.  The whole bathroom fills up with suds.  Like it overflows the tub.  Wait, you let it just overflow?  Yeah!  It overflows...  How high does it get?  About two feet high of bubbles in the entire bathroom. 
[01:52:30]  How the fuck comes that up for you?  Dumb bathrooms like a rave?  No, and then it...  Yeah, it looks like a rave.  And then, you know, the lights are out.  There's music playing.  So it's kind of cool.  And it's fun.  You just like...  What if you had to take a shit?  You had to get out of the shit in the bubbles?  I have more than one bathroom, sir.  That's the video you got to make.  Or at least take pictures.  It's fantastic.  And how are the women not cracking their skulls on the slippery fucking floors?  You got to watch that.  Oh, boy.  Me cleaning that mess up.  That's the second thing for a bathroom.  Chopping up the body.  Chopping up the body and you throw it. 
[01:53:00]  No, and then I had a mishap because the motor for the jacuzzi  got all wet with the bubbles and everything that went in there  and it blew the breaker, the circuit breaker.  I don't like baths.  You know why?  There's always that top drain that lets me know how fat I am.  Just...  If you start hearing...  Fat fuck.  The one that won't let itself overflow.  I get in, there's fucking...  There's an inch of water. 
[01:53:30]  That's funny.  Then my little dick is hanging out of the top like the Loch Ness Monster.  And the tip of my dick is cold.  And I got a little tiny cock.  So it's just this little mushroom sticking out of the water.  Sticking out of the water.  You got a small one?  Really?  I got a small tub, yeah.  Oh, you mean dick?  Yeah.  I got a little one when it's little.  Plus, when you're in a tub, you can't fuck in a tub.  It looks bored in the tub.  Your dick just floats to the top, and I'll look at it and just get bored.  There's no sex in the tub.  Your dick does have buoyancy, that's for sure. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, it floats.  The mushroom head will pop up.  Yeah, yeah.  The only way a tub is great is if it's dead.  You're a fucking alligator.  What?  Can you fuck an alligator?  No, your penis pops up like a...  Oh, your dick looks like a...  Yeah, like a pop-up out of the fucking...  You're going to have fun before.  Put a flashlight on and there's two little red eyes.  It's just a pee hole in part of the head.  You're not sexy in the tub.  It's like...  The tub is just, you know, you put the foam on your head, and you're like, ah, look at  me.  I got my cone head.  Right. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, look.  See?  He likes a good bath every once in a while.  Do you?  You know, yeah, it's fun.  What he's doing and what you're doing.  No, but he's trying...  See, I have no problem throwing myself under the bus.  I have a feeling he does take a bath every once in a while.  Not alone.  Yeah, but you're playing every once in a while.  No, but I wasn't alone.  I would never take a bath alone.  That's silly.  You have a sound...  You have a sound machine?  No, I don't.  Like waves of the ocean and the...  If you need to say that for the bit, it's okay.  But I don't.  You get a little Blackberry. 
[01:55:00]  I will check numbers.  I will play Candy Crush.  And every once in a while, I'll read a couple pages of a book.  Read a nice...  You read a book in a tub?  Not like a...  The Joy Luck Club.  Not like a romance novel or anything.  I'm really wrong with that.  And he grabbed her and hung her over the side of the mountain and kissed her passionately  as the werewolf howled in the...  What with the long-hair-illustrated guy on the cover?  Holding the woman in some fucking southern belle dress.  Love making the harlot.  He looks like Opie with faded jeans and long hair on the cover of the book. 
[01:55:30]  I'm reading Bob Saget's book, actually.  Oh, God.  I'm trying to get back into reading.  In the tub with Bob.  Trying.  Fucking reading is...  Wow, that's...  Trying.  It's not easy, though, with kids running in and out.  That's like probably also...  I want to jump in my fucking bath.  The alone time, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's really what it's about.  Just go soak for a little bit.  It's a motherfucker.  And all it is in the house now is just the same toy voice over. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, really?  Because every toy has that one lady.  It's that one.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.  Oh.  Fucking...  I want to murder her.  Her fucking tone.  Oh, the shape of a square, if you really care.  It's the same girl.  Yeah.  Close and coverage.  A, B, C, D, E, F, G.  H, I, J, K.  I don't know, P.  They do it in this fucking weird, addictive tone that you can't get out of your head all 
[01:56:30]  day.  Who do you want?  Brenda Vaccaro?  You just wanted to say Brenda Vaccaro.  Yes, I did.  Are you throwing toys out yet?  In the middle of the night?  You know what's weird?  When he's not looking?  No.  No, we haven't thrown any toys out yet.  I've thrown complete...  Oh, he's the anti-Santa.  I've thrown complete sets out.  Really?  Really, yeah.  That weren't even close to broken.  How about the toys that people...  I'm like, he's not playing with this thing.  Yeah.  It's got to go.  Wow.  No, that's a good one.  Because everybody, when you have a kid, and God, I love them all, but they all need to 
[01:57:00]  shower them with gifts every time they see them.  There's no room left in my house.  You don't take it to little poor kids?  Nah.  To a church?  Nah.  You don't fill up the box to the Goodwill?  Drop it off.  Actually, I do.  But it's not fun to see.  I used to do that with my dog.  You get to keep one gift, Tina.  The rest must go to the orphanage.  I used to do that with dog toys.  I throw out a lot of the broken shit, and then, yeah, we make a pile.  I would stab the dog toy, the little squeaky thing, in the middle of the night, I'd go  and stab it, so there'd be no more squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak.  You know, when he bit it? 
[01:57:30]  Have you had the toys go off in the middle of the night because the batteries are a little  low?  No.  I'll wait for that.  Really?  That's going to sound creepy.  It scares you a little bit.  Yeah.  Your house is all dark, and you hear some voice coming from somewhere, and you're like,  what the fuck is that?  And you find out it's some, like, I don't know, a Toy Story toy or something.  Did you hear that the guys are hacking into the baby monitors, and they're screaming  at the people?  Yeah.  And waking the baby up in the middle of the night?  I don't think there's anything, I would be fucking on the ground laughing. 
[01:58:00]  I heard some guy going, wake up, you little fucking cocksucker.  You probably did when you were a baby.  I would laugh, too, to be honest with you.  You have to laugh.  Yeah, that's kind of funny.  That's just too fucking funny.  If I was woken up in the middle of the night because some asshole tapped into my baby monitor,  I guess I'd have to laugh at that one.  Just some creepy Jersey voice? 
[01:58:30]  Oh, shit.  Hey, shithead.  Do you know who the creeps are yet, when you walk around with your kid?  No.  What do you mean?  You just know now.  Yeah, but I live in Westchester.  Something pops in your fucking brain, you know exactly where the kid touchers are in your  neighborhood.  I'll tell you what's real weird.  I was going to...  I bet you nine out of ten I would be correct, too.  Wow.  You'd probably get one wrong every once in a while, but you just know now.  Right.  Which ones are the problems?  Just how they look, how they talk to you, how they slow down their walk. 
[01:59:00]  Look, it's fucking creepy.  Tom Papa said that, too, in a story.  He did?  Yeah, he said you could just kind of look, and you see them look at your daughter a certain  way, or whatever, like, even if it's just a quick look, but you get it.  You just know.  You just get, yeah.  You just know.  You're lucky that you're not walking around the city with your kids.  I could be careful.  But I get weird, though, because I feel like I've looked at kids, like, hang on.  Yeah!  Go ahead, Bob.  But you look at a kid, like, oh, what a, like, especially after I had a kid, or when  I was about to have the kid, I've looked at kids, like, oh, look at a kid and say, oh, 
[01:59:30]  that's cute.  It's cute.  But I'll smile.  Like, I feel, you know, hey.  Yeah.  Smiling, and I feel, I want to make sure, I always make sure the parent is looking at  me, too.  Yeah.  Because I don't want them to turn around and see me and their kid waving at each other.  Waving, yeah.  Some bald guy in a dungary jacket that doesn't fit.  Right.  And you can't touch, you can't touch kids.  Well.  What do you mean, hey, hey, hey?  I was.  I wanted that to sit there for a second.  Bill Burr explains it perfectly in that bit, where, like, if a kid needs help or something,  you just can't help him. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Touch him.  Yeah.  You know Nick Schwartzen?  Yes.  I used to walk around Santa Monica with him, and we both lived in the same area.  He would walk behind kids and just pat their head.  What?  Like, a mother would be with the kid, and he'd walk by, and he'd just walk away.  What the fuck?  And the kid would turn around.  Well, that's fucking creepy.  That's creepy, man.  Yeah.  They'd get arrested.  Brother Joe wants in on this.  Joe.  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Hey, Joe.  What's up, Joe?  How old is your kid now? 
[02:00:30]  Ten months.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Throwing out toys you're talking about.  I can't even tell you.  My daughter, she's six now.  She'll be six on the 15th of this month.  Unbelievable with memory.  She knows.  She has inventory.  I don't know.  She's got everything ten times.  She's got every toy she could possibly have ten times.  I had to build a room over my room in, like, attic space and put a door in to store everything  that I've hidden, like, taken out of her room and put away. 
[02:01:00]  Out of circulation?  Right.  To take them out of toy circulation?  The memory is ridiculous, man.  She knows when it's missing, too.  She'll be like, yeah, Daddy, where did my creepy crawly go?  We made creepy crawly.  Where the creepy crawly go?  Your uncle is out on Long Island.  It's weird how he's starting to take over.  Like, we just got this house.  We just unpacked.  We just...  What was that smoke smell, by the way? 
[02:01:30]  I don't know, dude.  This is the weird thing about that.  If you...  Really quick.  We had it again at the same time on Sunday.  Same exact time this Sunday.  I saw it at Bobby's house with his wife watching Game of Thrones.  That's ghost shit.  It smelled like a little electrical burning.  You got an electrician in there.  Oh, shit.  No, but it went away, and all week, nothing, and I was going to call it, but nothing, and  then on Sunday, at the same exact time, same day, same time, just before Game of Thrones,  it smelled...  Maybe there's a timer on something you don't know about.  No. 
[02:02:00]  It clicks on and goes...  It's a ghost.  It's a ghost.  The ghost is pissed off, because Sundays used to be, you know, his day.  It's creepy.  It's creepy.  I checked all the lights.  There's nothing, but...  You should get an electrician in there to check the wires.  Hey, Joe.  Yeah?  I know you got something to plug.  Oh, the tent.  Yeah, yeah.  Yes.  That's good.  Yeah, we're doing it with me and Anthony.  We're getting a band back together, man.  This is a nice little fun.  This is all covers off of fun.  It's not the rock cut thing. 
[02:02:30]  No.  Yeah, we're doing everything.  A little bit of every song ever written in the world.  Down in Patchogue.  Down in Patchogue, a place called The Village Idiot on Main Street.  Yes.  Patchogue, a very cool place to play.  That'll be fun.  A very cool place to play.  I'm looking forward to it.  A bunch of guys we haven't played with in a long time, too.  Yeah, we did a rehearsal this past Sunday.  Yep.  Anthony was probably sitting there the entire time.  Yes, of course.  He didn't make it.  Oh, please.  I cut you a little.  Oh, my God. 
[02:03:00]  Total lack of dedication.  Total lack of dedication right out of the band.  You know what's the creepiest thing I ever did with a kid?  I got it.  Uh-oh.  Oh, jeez.  Hold on a second.  Let me get ready.  I probably appreciate this.  You guys will appreciate it.  It's a quick story.  I was walking through a supermarket one time.  This was before I had Layla.  This was before I had my daughter.  And, like, way before.  And there was this little kid sitting in a basket.  You know, one of the shopping carts.  And as I'm passing by the kid, like, the mom had her back to me. 
[02:03:30]  She was, like, you know, looking at the food.  And I'm walking down the aisle.  And this little kid, maybe three years old, flips me the fucking bird.  He flips me the finger.  Plain as day.  He looked at me, makes a face, and sticks his middle finger up at me.  I was so fucking.  I got it.  It just.  It made me laugh.  But at the same time, I was pissed off.  I go to the lady.  Now, the kid, there's a look of horror on this kid's face at this point.  I said, excuse me, miss.  Your son flipped me the bird. 
[02:04:00]  He gave me the finger.  She was fucking amazed.  She was like, what the fuck?  You got to be kidding me.  He would never do anything like that.  Okay.  I know that you guys are talking.  And I'm on.  No.  What are you talking about?  We're listening to.  Don't.  You fucking.  Oh, my God.  He's so paranoid.  You know, you guys are actually listening to my story.  It's the first.  Jesus Christ.  This show fucking takes down the best of them.  How do you fuck with Joe?  He's all like, oh, what are you guys doing? 
[02:04:30]  His self-esteem just fell off the fucking head.  I love it.  We're just listening.  So the lady was absolutely incensed.  She got pissed off at the kids.  Yeah, what happened next?  The kid on his ass.  Well, as I was walking away, I turned around, I flipped the kid to bird and made the creepy  laughing face.  That was it.  Whole story.  Done.  Finished.  That was a good story, how you matched the witch with a three-year-old.  Wow. 
[02:05:00]  Wow.  We're going to be the village idiot on the 10th.  Yeah.  We're going to be.  Yeah, we're going to be.  End of story.  So to speak.  Have you seen Fargo yet?  Did you watch any of that?  Yeah, I kind of like it.  That was good?  The TV series.  Yeah.  Three episodes.  Really good.  Billy Bob is always good.  He's always good in what he does.  All right, fellas.  Have a great day.  All right, Joe.  The living room is taking over now.  Like, my nice house is done.  I had to put an octagon in the middle of the living room. 
[02:05:30]  Really?  With just throw the toys in there, throw him in there, and lock him in.  But he's not walking yet, right?  He'll crawl and then grab.  Wait till he walks.  No, he stands up on everything.  You're going to lose at least another room.  At least.  What do you mean?  You're going to lose another room.  You'll see.  I'm not losing another room.  I don't have another room.  Check back with me.  What do you mean another room?  You'll be able to do that.  Whether it's a dining room or a guest room, you're losing another room to your kid.  It's a guarantee.  He's got his bedroom. 
[02:06:00]  And then the backyard.  So you've got the bedroom and the dining room.  Oh, you do have a backyard.  I've got a backyard.  You might be all right.  You might be all right.  You might.  Give him two blocks and say, play with these.  Right.  That's his toys.  That's what I grew up with.  That's right.  Make something.  I remember my mom gave me a spoon and put me in front of a tree.  A spoon?  She says, finish this.  Spoon.  That's where it all will be.  When Jim hears me come up with the excitement in his face, I wish somebody could record just 
[02:06:30]  slow motion him when he hears me mention anything with food because his eyes widen and then  it's like, because she wanted you to finish it.  Can we get to the Jenny Hutt thing?  And can we get her on the line?  Does Jenny Hutt?  I don't understand her at all.  The fiery redhead.  Yes.  We were talking about a little earlier.  Big red bush that should be down there but isn't.  She tweeted, I may or may not be stuck in a small pond of water en route to my kid's  school. 
[02:07:00]  Tow truck on the way.  A lot of flooding here.  I mean, she's turned on.  Oh, she's moist.  Yeah, exactly.  A small pond of water.  A vagina has a fucking mop bucket dumped into it.  So she drove into a lake.  Yeah, but you could see the road where it's not that deep.  What's wrong with this broad?  Did she hit it a little fast and the engine got wet?  I don't know.  Is she driving a fucking 1980 fucking Pinto?  It's one of those little, what do they call those little fucking cars that you park?  They're like two feet long.  Oh, the smart cars. 
[02:07:30]  Smart car, yeah.  And then she said her kid had to be, her son rescued and on way to school.  I'm still here.  That's pretty deep, dude.  I'm an idiot.  Look into the right side.  You can tell that it's not that deep.  It's almost dry on the right side.  No, that's a wave, dude.  That goes all the way to, the water goes all the way to, you can see the reflection of  those rocks in the water.  That's a wave.  That's not the, that's not the line.  What about this line in the middle?  Is that, that, that's the, uh, that's the middle, right?  Of the road?  No. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, that's a, that's a lake, dude.  Oh, come on.  No, that's a legitimate pond.  Oh, come on.  Here, we got Jenny on the line.  Jenny.  Hut.  I'm a moron, okay?  Just call me what I am.  I'm an idiot.  I'm a moron.  You're not going to like it.  I'm all those things, just say it, I'll take my luck, I'm an idiot.  Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, what happened?  What happened?  What happened, dummy?  I thought, yes, dummy, that's right, say it again.  How far can we take this?  Can we call you the C word?  Oh.  Can we go all the way up to the C word? 
[02:08:30]  You need to go for it, basically, but you'd have to put dumb in front of it or stupid.  See, thank you, and you guys were defending her.  I knew from the get-go she was just stupid.  Let's hear the story.  Let's hear the story.  Go ahead, you idiot.  I went through one body of water and thought I was fine, and then I didn't realize that  this next one was deeper than what I was in, and I am a loser because I thought my car  would get through it, and it didn't, and so my son and I were stuck in a pond, and now 
[02:09:00]  I've been resting.  It's not a pond.  The water was on the road.  The guy fly fishing didn't tip you off?  Yeah, exactly.  Did the car just-  What?  What?  What?  I'm not proud.  Did the car just stall on you?  It just died out?  Yes.  The battery works, but the car does not.  I don't know what's going to happen.  How deep was the water?  It didn't cover- the door was able to be open.  Oh, God.  What kind of car are you driving that dies out in a little puddle? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, you go slow through that.  I did.  It shouldn't have died, and it did.  But I think-  You should have your kids take it away.  What kind of car do you drive?  What is this?  An old-  What does your husband give you?  That old piece of shit car?  Guys, I drive a fancy car.  It's radio.  I do it for the radio.  You drive a fancy car.  What kind of fancy car?  It's an X5.  A BMW X5.  She wanted them Jew broads.  Drives a fancy BMW.  BMW X5. 
[02:10:00]  Damn, you got money.  Oh, okay.  It's true.  And, yeah.  You got the money.  All right.  And then you're just stuck in a puddle.  Oh, boy.  Were you embarrassed when the tow truck came?  Embarrassed?  I was embarrassed.  If I tell you guys the worst part of the story, there was another car stuck before me,  and I thought that I would get through it, even though the camera stuck.  You need an SUV for that shit.  Right.  I have an SUV.  It should have worked.  And it did it.  Anyway, there were lovely people who helped, and my sister helped, and the tow truck helped.  And I have video on someone's back taking me out of my car. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, there you go.  Where did you leave the world?  Oh, really?  How did that feel?  You like that, huh?  Did you rub your bush against his back?  You got no bush.  In my pajamas.  Oh.  Were you in your pajamas?  For your pleasure.  You left your house in your pajamas?  I did.  I'm a regular mother.  She leaves her house in her pajamas to drive her kid to school.  Not knowing that maybe, you know. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, there might be something might happen.  Yeah.  And you need to be in clothes.  You look silly.  Let's say it again.  Did you ever watch The Walking Dead?  Yeah.  She'd be in pajamas.  Stuck in pajamas with The Walking Dead chasing her.  Did you have slippers on?  Practically, yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean, not slippers.  Were you wearing panties?  I sleep in, like, sweatpants, but without panties.  So you didn't have panties on.  What about a bra?  It's a bit swampy.  No bra, no panties.  Just some little PJs. 
[02:11:30]  Like a limp arm.  They're not little.  I mean, I'm, like, gross.  And then you got up on a guy's back.  He definitely felt your pubis.  Oh, great.  Your pubic mouth.  And your warm clit.  He felt your labia majora.  Yeah.  I'm going to throw up.  So that's what he was thinking.  Yeah.  Swollen hood.  He felt your vulva.  Yeah.  Mushed it in his back like a fucking face up against the window.  Yeah.  Her legs all spread with just pajamas on.  Yeah.  It's up against their fucking pajamas like a bank robber. 
[02:12:00]  She probably had more than before they got to higher ground.  Yes.  Oh, that's sexy now.  Throwing a prosciutto over your shoulder.  Oh, that's hot.  Oh, Jenny.  What are we going to do with you?  It's like being attacked by leeches.  By the way, I should be put in the corner for like a month and all that.  Oh, yes.  How about over a knee?  You need a spanking.  You really do.  Jenny, you're going to come in here and I'm going to give you a spanking.  That's right. 
[02:12:30]  To teach you a lesson.  I've got to teach you.  So this doesn't happen again.  Never go out in your PJs.  Yes.  Across the face.  Yeah.  Get your ass as red as your bush.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nice.  Right?  Oh, boy.  Oh, man.  Oh, did I inadvertently slap your pussy?  Here, I'll kiss it all better.  Yeah.  Well, you know you slapped it because you feel the tip of your fingers wet.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, stop making believe you hate this. 
[02:13:00]  Exactly.  You're in a puddle again, aren't you?  Yeah.  You've got your own puddle.  Yeah.  So are you okay now?  Yes, I'm fine now.  Oh, look at her blushing.  Your car running?  No, my car does not run.  I don't know what's going to happen.  At least I have insurance.  I'm sure Daddy will take care of it.  You're all right.  There are people for that.  I don't worry about it.  There are people for that.  Right.  Insurance.  Yeah, it'll be fine.  Daddy will just tell you to throw that one away and he'll get you a new one.  Right, right.  Just leave it where it's stalled.  We'll buy you a new one.  Yeah, we don't give a fuck. 
[02:13:30]  That wealthy, hot money.  She's got a lot of money, Bobby.  A lot of money.  Oh, yeah.  How much is she worth, Jenny?  Are we done?  No.  How many millions?  I don't know any of that.  Are you?  It's true?  Oh, yeah.  She's got at least eight figures.  Really?  At least, right?  Wow.  You're good for eight figures, right?  What does she look like?  Can I see a picture of her?  Pop-up Jenny.  Got it.  She lives on a compound next to her dad.  Her dad built a house next to his.  That's how the story goes, right? 
[02:14:00]  I was actually right.  Oh, that used to be.  That used to be her, Bobby.  See, there's hope.  She lost weight, though.  Look at that.  I just loved how Sam Googled her.  But I think she's kind of sexy as a fat broad.  I think you were a sexy little fat chick.  You were a sexy fat broad.  Yeah.  I didn't feel that way.  Oh, man.  Let me see her now.  Oh, she got her shit together.  Look at her.  She looks all right.  Oh, yeah.  She looks good there.  She looks good.  As much as we beat the shit out of her, she looks good. 
[02:14:30]  All redheads love zebra print.  They like that zebra print, huh?  It's so loud.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Showing some cleaning.  It's nice with the ample titties hanging down.  I love those, like, old, broad, freckled titty things.  You know what I mean?  Like, Nethaven, that porn girl.  Yeah, like, they just never put sunscreen on when they light up.  That's a calling card for a cock right there.  That really is.  You're bending over, showing so much cleaning.  That's the other one.  Right?  Do you let her titty fuck you?  What?  Do you let your husband titty fuck you? 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, you can do whatever you want.  She's married?  Yeah.  What the fuck are you guys getting me into?  He's married to, like, a male model.  She's married to, like, a supermodel.  Can I see him?  This guy is fucking beautiful.  He's a supermodel, and he probably could kick her ass.  He's very nice.  She's probably a...  Jenny's probably a trooper in the sack.  Oh, you put fat Jenny Hut in there?  That's how they came up?  That's how we Googled her.  I thought her fat pictures just came up.  She used to be a fatty.  No, it's good, though.  Like, your fat picture is being taken over by the new ones. 
[02:15:30]  Jesus Christ.  Her husband's huge.  Yeah, he could kick her ass probably.  Yeah, he's a big guy.  He looks like he would be a problem.  He's all handsome.  No, he's a problem.  I know.  What are we doing?  He's got that fucking Joe Rogan 5 o'clock shadow at 10 o'clock in the morning.  Has so much testosterone fucking pumping through his body.  He's just flying out of his face.  I don't know what we're doing.  We're stupid.  He doesn't even fit in the seat behind on the...  No.  Oh, my God.  He's a giant head like a George Clooney head.  Yeah, honey, good for you that you lost the weight.  I bet he has a big penis, too.  Uh-oh. 
[02:16:00]  Great feet.  Oh, jeez.  He's all good.  I like him.  He's much cooler than I am.  Hey, did Oprah get back to you?  We saw that you tweeted Oprah.  Yeah.  He did not.  And by the way, you have to understand that I had gone to a premiere of The Butler, and  then I did speak to her in that premiere, and so that's...  What did you have her get you?  Yeah.  Why is she rich?  That's what I'm talking about.  By the way, last night you tweeted.  Old money.  You didn't think that Sterling should own a team. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, because it came out, but I don't like how it came out is what I'm saying.  Right.  I understand that.  I think that's my logic on the whole thing.  Yeah, yeah.  But now I'm kind of bothered, because everyone says shitty things, and a lot of these NBA  players have done shitty things, and they were never banned for life.  Right.  Latrell Sprewell choked the shit out of his coach.  That's right, PJ.  PJ Carlissimo, and I don't know.  I think you've got like 60 days, that's it. 
[02:17:00]  60-game suspension or something.  Right.  I think it's a...  And I think Anthony also said this yesterday or the day before, that private conversations  are private conversations, and everybody in every household says to their...  Horrible things.  ...conversations, things that are horrible.  Imagine the Hutt household, what gets thrown around there.  Absolutely.  Terrible things about people of certain ethnic backgrounds.  Absolutely.  She's rich because her dad owned a record label or something.  Right?  Yeah.  What's your story again? 
[02:17:30]  You had like Lionel Richie or something at your Sweet 16?  Run DMC.  No, no, no.  Run DMC and Beats with...  I can get Run DMC.  You can get him now, but when she turned 16, they were on top of the world.  Run Aerosmith?  And they played at her Sweet 16 party because Daddy got him.  They were on their rock tour.  And told Run DMC to get the fuck over to his house for his daughter's 16th birthday.  Spoiled little brat.  And she ran like a retarded girl to get a fucking pony and a...  What?  Her dad brought her a little oven and a brush. 
[02:18:00]  Jenny, you're about to be taken.  Can we play the Jenny Hut video clip from when she was 16?  I love that one.  Oh, it's so effective.  It's embarrassing.  Why?  It's good.  It's so good.  It's great.  You're about to be taken.  I'm so obnoxious.  And then what?  Daddy built the house right next to his because he didn't want you to go too far?  It's a long story.  Like his?  It's a Jenny Hut.  It's a goddamn country mansion.  That's a mansion.  That's her house?  Is that your house?  It's the house they grew up in.  Oh, my God. 
[02:18:30]  It's a castle.  It's a castle.  How many of you have 17 brothers and sisters?  You look like you're doing a special report in front of Buckingham Palace.  Yes.  Wait, but explain.  So then you guys had so much land, he built you a ridiculous house right...  No, no, no.  We bought property next door and then merged it.  Yeah.  And then he merged it and then he built a house for you guys.  How big is your house?  I don't know.  It's a normal apartment.  She has a microphone that cost probably $40,000 at the time.  Yeah, at the time, no one was doing this. 
[02:19:00]  She's got a mic and a camera.  No, that's what her dad brought her to sing into.  Oh, right.  She wants to be a singer.  Her real dad brought her that.  Go back here.  Dumbo trotted away to her fucking...  I just want to thank you so much for my party.  It's not Long Island, this is.  I'm really excited and I'm mostly excited because all my friends are here and everyone's going to be here.  And it should be great, I'm hoping.  And I left it in your hands and didn't know anything about it.  It's one big surprise.  Every girl I grew up with sounded exactly like this.  And I'll be so candid.  We know.  Amazily. 
[02:19:30]  Speaking with her top upper teeth only.  You're incredible for living with me for 16 years.  And Brian, you two, the same thing.  You lose your virginity that night?  Grandma and Grandpa, of course.  How can I get you guys?  Six years before.  How are you going to lose your virginity wearing a fucking curtain?  Three years later.  Hi again.  How are you doing?  Well, we just had a little technical difficulties a minute ago, but hey, that's why.  Did you have a nose job?  Grandma and Grandpa, you're unreal and I love you and you're great. 
[02:20:00]  Wow.  Jenny was a nice girl, though.  She's not snotty.  No.  Kim, Liz, Anna, and Sarah.  And she's good on the mic.  Sarah.  It's like a Nazi propaganda film.  You're not here, but you can be watching the tape.  So how do you two?  She's some pretty German shepherds walking the background.  And everyone.  Hitler painting.  She's adorable.  And I hope you all had a good time.  Well, now have a good time, but in the end, have a good time.  Did you shave your pussy back then? 
[02:20:30]  Jesus.  And I can't believe it's here.  No?  Big red bush.  This is my sister, Stacey.  Oh, my God.  There you go.  There's Stacey.  Look at that house.  Wow.  Castle.  Yeah.  Two years ago.  April 7th.  You guys look like you should wrestle.  I love her.  She'll say Marion, Stacey.  A conversion of Marion.  Oh, isn't that sweet?  Are we just the loving sisters?  Oh, boy.  I see them backing up into each other.  I don't want your feelings hurt, Harris. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, you mean people are going to see this when?  Yeah.  After.  In 2014.  Yes.  Mommy, Daddy, we love you again.  And Felicia Eisen.  I mean, why?  Don't say that.  Felicia Eisen.  Okay.  Felicia and Perry.  I'm horrified.  I just want to stress.  No.  Don't say stuff.  Be quiet.  Pipe down.  Right.  Look at the house.  House is great.  Okay, scratch.  But it's okay.  It's got one of those driveways.  Yeah, it's one of those driveways that, like, Eddie Murphy pulls up into. 
[02:21:30]  Hi, Mars.  Hi, Nancy.  Hi, Jane.  Hi, me.  Hi, Lisa.  I wish I was a fucking meteor.  How did you know so many people?  You were very popular.  Well, let me tell you that.  Well, she was rich.  I'd be like, hey, Joe Curry, Simo, Frank, Tit.  I can't hear you.  Be quiet.  We're almost done.  I hope the limo backs up over both of them.  That's cool.  You're staying next to Sammy Hagar in 2006. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, you're getting in the limo now?  She does have the lead singer of Warren's teeth.  Wow, that's a hell of a party right there.  What a nice, grateful girl, though.  Wow.  Oh, and I'd like to say thank you, and I love you to Bob.  That's a crazy, that type of rich.  Yeah.  At that age.  It's like, when you grew up with that type of rich.  That house is worth how much now, Jenny?  Come on.  I really don't know.  I don't know. 
[02:22:30]  Millions.  Try at least ten.  Ten.  At least.  I was nice.  I was not bratty.  My parents would have never tolerated that.  No.  No, you were brought up right.  Did that house have a pool in the backyard?  Yes.  Any pool videos of Jenny?  Yeah.  Want to release some more tapes?  A little bikini?  No.  Doing a split over the jacuzzi, Jen?  All right.  Oh.  Huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're welcome.  You live near me.  You're welcome to come by any time.  You've got to check out the hut estate. 
[02:23:00]  I've got to check out the hut estate, yes.  Do you still live in that house?  I don't live here, too, but you don't live here.  Yeah, I live next door to it.  So your father lives in that house still, and you live next door to that house.  Is your house as big as that house?  No, of course not.  Did your father buy you your new house?  No.  Your husband did?  Yeah, this is going back.  I've lived here since 2000.  We lived in the city first, and I'm married for almost 17 years.  What does your husband do for work?  Insurance.  Okay. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I see.  Very good.  I see.  Well, you're welcome to come over to the compound, too, you know.  You can come over to the compound any time and, you know, hit the pool and jacuzzi there.  Likewise.  Slumming it.  Right.  You are welcome here.  Nice.  I would love to go.  Oh, I thought we had something special.  Come on over.  All right.  All right, Jenny.  Watch those puddles, huh?  All right.  All right.  I know.  We're glad you're safe, okay?  Thanks.  Thanks, guys.  Go make fun of me. 
[02:24:00]  Goodbye.  No, no.  We're good now.  We need to really take her up on that.  Yeah.  We need to all go up there and bring everybody.  Yeah.  We need to bring Keith.  Oh, shit.  We need to bring everybody and really teach her not to ever do that again.  She's in my neighborhood.  No.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  She's in my neighborhood.  And Keith, that might be a problem getting him into the neighborhood.  Really?  Yeah.  Can we smuggle him?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He could do that.  I think they only allow one at a time.  Really?  He's four.  They like keeping the numbers down. 
[02:24:30]  He's considered four.  Yeah.  That's why Carlton's the only one that comes over.  Because his name sounds white.  Yeah.  Carlton.  I'm here with my friend Carlton.  It's a banker.  Oh, and then, you know, he'll get up to sing karaoke and he's doing like air supply songs.  So, you know, he's safe.  You got to train him?  Well.  You have to learn these songs.  No, I got.  You can't come this summer.  I didn't have to train him.  But whoever trained him before did a great job because he's not a problem.  Where do you want to hang out?  In the city or in the suburbs? 
[02:25:00]  Well, then you sing this song.  All out of love.  I'm so lost without you.  It really is.  Her husband was in a bodybuilding contest in 2012.  Got this in front too late.  Yeah.  That guy's a problem.  Yeah, he's an issue.  I don't know what we're doing.  He's a problem.  He's a problem.  Well, you're not as stupid as Anthony.  I'm just, you know, I'm just putting it out there.  You know.  Dude.  He ought to be flattered that somebody else finds his wife attractive.  What?  That's not how it works. 
[02:25:30]  No?  No, not when you're talking about a fire red bush.  I always hated my wife, so I don't understand what it's like to give a flying fuck what anybody  does to her.  Let's say hi to Mr. Rich Voss, who is featured on the Opie and Anthony podcast this week.  Go get it.  What's up, Rich?  Oh, my God.  How's it going?  Hold on.  That's him?  Yeah.  That's great.  Oh, jeez.  We're going to stop talking about her.  First of all, here's the deal.  I can't get out of my town. 
[02:26:00]  It's taking me over an hour.  Every goddamn fucking road is flooded.  And I can't get out.  It's a one rich town.  Move out of the sticks, gentlemen.  I don't have XM in my car, so I figure if I call, I get to hear you guys for a while.  Yeah.  Oh, is that it?  You're going to pay for XM on your phone.  Yeah, man.  I pay for it on my phone.  I have it on my phone.  Oh, I'm a clicking happening.  I don't have unlimited service, so it costs too much to download it. 
[02:26:30]  Unlimited service?  Yeah, you fucking idiot.  I got to pay for it.  How am I the idiot when you call unlimited data, unlimited service?  Fucking dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.  It's the same thing.  I like Bobby fighting the earth to say Jew there.  He just said dumb, dumb.  I'm sorry, Rich.  Now, yesterday, I heard you did a best or rich, Voss.  Yes.  I guarantee it wasn't me fucking killing and like trashing any of you guys.  I guarantee it was all my mistakes. 
[02:27:00]  I guarantee it wasn't my mistakes.  That's right.  It's an 11-day podcast.  Why would you call?  I don't know.  I just don't call.  No, it's scary to be on the phone with this radio show.  No, I would never.  I don't call.  No, it's not a good place to be.  Oh, boy, this is real scary.  I'm telling you.  I'm telling you.  This is scary at the times when I used to come back in Harlem. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, he did.  Put himself in some situations.  Hey, Voss, you're doing your show coming up, right?  At the Village Underground again.  May 20th, we're doing a live podcast with Jim Norton as our guest marriage counselor.  Nice.  Oh, nice.  Yeah, I talked to them yesterday.  Tickets sell it fast.  There's only 200 seats.  And it sold out last time.  So.  It'll sell out again.  Yeah, if you guys want to go.  Yeah.  It's going to be fun.  When is that?  And if Bobby sits, then there's only going to be 140.  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:28:00]  Bobby, you take up that many seats now?  Yeah, 60 seats.  Bob's a little heavy set.  Well, I lost weight a little bit.  Well, I think you're only taking up about 40 at this point.  40?  Yeah.  40 seats, I'll take.  All right.  Jesus.  There's cops everywhere.  Like, it's everywhere.  I know, right?  How do you resist not hitting the fucking red button?  Well, listen, I got to go because this isn't going well.  This is good.  It's so scary calling into you guys. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, yeah.  Look out.  All right, Rich.  We'll see you soon.  All right, buddy?  I wish it was boss, not Patrice, calling in.  Oh, Rich.  Oh, Rich.  Yeah, yeah.  What the fuck?  Yeah, that doesn't hurt a little.  I'm sorry, Rich.  I made a joke the other day on the air.  What was it?  It was something about, somebody said, oh, I wish Patrice was still around or something.  And I said something that would have led people to believe that Bonnie would have liked to have been married to Patrice instead of Rich and that Rich be dead. 
[02:29:00]  Jesus.  But it was, you know, set in a humorous fashion.  Did you giggle at the end of it?  Yeah, that was it.  Jesus.  It's so funny when something completely is out of line.  And you go, no, it was humorous.  Yes, there was much jocularity involved at the time.  It was jovial.  You guys are my... 
[02:29:30]  Oh, did he hang up?  I guess he was going for a bit there.  It's even worse that you didn't hang up on him this time and you just let him.  Let him.  I just looked over at Opie's on his phone playing some game.  No, no, no.  Swing.  I'm not playing.  I was getting...  Eric actually texted me about the Boss podcast.  It's car on eBay, comedy tour Starbucks.  Remember when he used to just go into Starbucks?  Oh, yeah.  That would be a good one.  So, it's not us just making fun of him.  Getting his teeth fixed at the dentist. 
[02:30:00]  Oof.  Comedy tour when he did it at Rue 57.  Walked in and just did comedy for strangers.  I've heard a lot of people commenting on him giving out his password.  That's on there?  His Facebook password.  Hilarious.  Which is hilarious.  I don't know why somebody didn't pick that up.  Like some network or some internet company didn't pick up him just popping in doing stand-up  at Starbucks or whatever.  Random place.  That's hilarious.  Brilliant.  Okay.  Brief case of ex-girlfriend pics. 
[02:30:30]  Voss used to do crack and much more on the Opie and Anthony podcast featuring Rich Voss.  Jenny's...  Jenny Hutt's dad is worth...  Don't give his name out or anything.  $300 million.  That's it?  What?  Wow.  He's worth $300 million.  He's considered a mogul?  Yeah.  $300 million is a mogul.  Wow.  A mogul.  You'll never, ever, ever, ever be...  Be a mogul?  Your kids' kids' kids won't be poor. 
[02:31:00]  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  You've got to really fucked up to lose $300 million.  Your kids...  Like if you had kids...  Like your kids...  My kids' kids will be poor.  Your kids' kids...  It'll go away that fast.  Right.  Your kids' kids...  I've already figured this out.  Yeah.  You did the math.  My kids will be all right, but my kids' kids, not so much.  If your kids don't...  Not so much.  If your kids don't take your money and make it into more money...  Unless they do their own thing.  Yeah.  And they're successful.  If they're successful, then...  But if they're counting on me, man, no.  My kids' kids will be... 
[02:31:30]  Their kids...  Your kids' kids...  We'll be right back in middle class.  No problem.  No, you'll be right in community cars taking a tub.  No problem.  Taking a tub with a candle.  I did think that.  I'm like, oh, man.  How far would this money last?  Yeah.  My kids are right.  Not so much extra.  Well, your kids are right.  I'm looking at my kid every day.  I'm trying, kid.  I'm trying.  Boy, she...  Did she go by that last name?  Yeah.  Wow.  Really?  Amazing.  Do you know that last name?  It sounds familiar, but...  You've heard that last name.  It just sounds like a rich guy's name. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  It just sounds like a rich guy's name.  Yeah.  I think I caddied for him.  Yeah.  Really?  I feel like I caddied for him.  I got to ask if he played a certain golf course.  Her brother wrote that?  When I was growing up.  Okay.  If I had that much money, though, I would...  If I met just a random...  Like, say, I can't...  About this show, and I met Jimmy, and I was hanging with him a little bit,  but I'd just throw him a hundred grand.  You'd have to.  Yeah.  I'm going to hang with you.  If you were just a fan.  Three hundred million is fucking... 
[02:32:30]  That's Arthur money.  Wouldn't you just give away some of that money?  No.  Can you legally give somebody a hundred thousand?  Yeah, I'm sure you can.  There's just certain gifts that are not taxable.  I don't know the laws...  You can give up the tax implications.  For the most part, you give up to, like, twelve a year.  And then after that, they have to get their little fucking greedy hands.  So I can't just give you...  If I wanted to give you a hundred thousand dollars, I couldn't give it to you.  Not...  Without getting hit with taxes.  I'm not...  Yeah, it would be a little complicated.  I don't know the exact answer, but I think it gets a bit complicated. 
[02:33:00]  I don't know what they might do.  There might be some workarounds I'm not sure of.  Isn't there one time giving things...  I'm certainly not giving out a hundred thousand dollars.  If you had three hundred million dollars, you wouldn't give a hundred thousand dollars to somebody?  Like a friend or somebody.  I've given...  I've given that out.  And I'm nowhere near that to help people get started in certain things.  Yes.  Yes.  They have to earn it if they want it.  I'll give it, but I don't care who you are.  Friend, family, you want some money?  Get my dick out and tug it. 
[02:33:30]  Jesus.  Money for yourself.  Friends and family?  Absolutely.  Something personal.  Tug my prick.  Nothing personal.  Tug my prick.  God damn it.  Let's take a break.  Let's get the plugs in for Bob Kelly, who's going to be here.  Where's Sandy, by the way?  Is she here?  Oh, no.  Piece of shit.  Sandy's not coming in.  Why?  What happened?  Well, I got voicemails from her.  Is she mad at us?  No.  Oh.  She's super enthusiastic last night.  She's probably a little scared.  No, not so much.  And then late, late last night decides that it's raining. 
[02:34:00]  She's a mental patient.  Do you know that she used to fuck a lot of comics?  She used to fuck her?  Yeah.  Like, guys, she was, like, fuckable.  Oof.  Yeah, like, well, no, the generation before me, before me, before me.  Yeah.  All right.  You know what I mean?  Well, she talks about Richard Pryor fucking her.  Yeah, like, a lot of comics in New York were fucking Sandy Kane.  Yeah.  And I can see, you can see it if you look at her and squint. 
[02:34:30]  Like David Brenner?  Yeah.  Like David Brenner would have fucked her.  He did fuck her.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Wow.  He fucked her.  He admitted fuck her.  Robert Klein would fuck her?  I don't know.  But if you look at a comedy club now, you can see Sandy, like, the Sandy Kane.  The Sandy Kane of now.  Of now, at the club, like, hanging out at the cellar bar.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  Bobby's going to be at Harrah's Atlantic City tonight.  Tonight.  Nick DiPaolo.  Nick DiPaolo.  That's a great show, man.  That's a crazy show tonight.  All right.  Go get tickets for that.  And then over the weekend, it's the Stress Factory in New Brunswick, New Jersey. 
[02:35:00]  Friday?  Saturday.  Yeah, Friday.  But go Friday.  Fuck Saturday.  Why?  I don't know.  I always like to fill Friday up first.  And then, because the club owner's like, I can fill Saturday on my own.  All right.  Go ahead, then.  7, 3, 2, 5, 4, 5.  Ha, ha.  It's Vinny's Club.  Oh, yeah.  Get it?  Yes.  Easy to remember, though.  More with Bob Kelly.  Nice. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, this is good stuff right here.  Oh, this could be the anniversary of the crucifixion?  No.  Uh.  Ma.  It's a dark sounding.  Why are you playing this, Sal?  I don't see it.  Just because I like it.  Thank you, Sal.  Ma, na, na, na.  All right.  We got Bob Kelly in studio playing Harrah's in Atlantic City tonight with Nick DiPaolo.  DiPaolo.  It's going to be a good show.  Hey. 
[02:36:00]  Very good show.  And we were supposed to have Sidney Kane in to talk about the NYPD arresting her and  throwing her in the old slammer for the weekend.  I guess she wasn't close enough to her guitar case when she was performing in Times Square.  But do you think they arrested her for that or when they said something to her, she might  have been like, what the fucking thing's right there, man?  Oh, sure.  Yeah, maybe she was belligerent.  Wow, that's a great impression.  Maybe she was belligerent.  Yeah.  If she probably would have said, oh, sorry, officer, let me bring it right over.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I doubt she did that.  Well, we got voicemails because she was supposed to be in today. 
[02:36:30]  And even a voicemail from her is kind of fun.  So.  Yo, hi, Sam.  Sandy Kane.  It is a Wednesday night in the rain.  And I'm looking forward to being there and talk about, I don't know if you read the post  today in page six that they did now, Blues Get Cowgirl.  And just talk about this unintended package that if you have an unintended package for  even, you know, walk away for a second, come back, you can be arrested. 
[02:37:00]  And it's not even in the books.  It's this law.  They made it up, and all of a sudden, I'm arrested.  And it was so devastating for me.  So they wrote about it in the post.  So let's talk about it.  I thought it would be great.  And maybe even download Jailhouse Rock by Elvis.  And I just talk about going to jail in New York City.  She's so old school.  It really takes a lot.  I mean, years ago, it took a lot.  You had to murder a cop to get arrested. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, I wasn't even doing anything.  But as the article said, I was topless.  So maybe that was the reason.  They can't arrest me for that.  So they'll arrest me for some ridiculous law.  I mean, it was my guitar case, and I'm playing the guitar.  It's a foot away.  So anyway, I'll see you tomorrow.  And I just thought I'd give you those ideas, and we'll talk about going to jail.  Ooh, bye.  She sounds very normal and coherent. 
[02:38:00]  Then she called a little later, and this is a quicker message.  Yeah, Sam, it's still raining like crazy.  I might not make it today.  And I can't sleep.  So I'm looking at the window.  It's still raining.  If it's still raining, 4, 30, 5, 6, I don't think I'll be able to come.  So maybe we'll make it some other time.  What, does she melt?  Yeah. 
[02:38:30]  Does she melt in the rain?  What, is she old?  She probably doesn't like walking in the rain, I guess.  She doesn't want to spend the money on the cabs.  Her wig probably gets all fucking wet.  What about the guy, you know, who fell in love with her once?  You know there's a guy who, she was like, look, I've got to stop this.  I've got my career to think about.  Yeah, you've got a big career coming.  Yeah.  Yeah, I've got to go play your time, man.  The fucking bullet that asshole dodged. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  Right.  Do you understand the bullet that that motherfucker...  You ever look at girls now that you were really liked back in the day, and you're like, oh my God, did I dodge a fucking, just a massive bullet?  Oh, yeah.  And then you see some that still look good, and you're like, all right, she turned out well, but 80% of them just fucking oinkers.  Fell apart.  That's because they never got over us.  It's just a mess. 
[02:39:30]  What's going on with the Heisman Trophy winner and the crab legs?  This is a fucking story, man.  Something about that he's broke and hungry?  Well, a lot of these athletes, it's been said, you know, the sanctions and all that crap, they're looking closely at all these universities.  These players just don't have money, man.  Where is the story?  I've got to find it first.  I should have been prepared.  I heard he was, like, broke and hungry.  Well, with the crab legs, that's the story you're looking for. 
[02:40:00]  They want to take back the Heisman Trophy.  Really?  Why?  Because they say if you were running with crab legs, you had an unfair advantage.  Wow.  I'm embarrassed that I thought that, much less said it.  Wow.  Yes.  You think that was a good one?  That was so bad.  Winston issued citation for shoplifting.  $32 worth of crab legs.  Florida State's Heisman Trophy winning quarterback.  Is that James? 
[02:40:30]  James with an I in there?  James?  James Winston.  J-A-M-E-I-S.  Jameis Gum.  James Winston.  James Gum.  I don't know, man.  It could have been just another way to spell James.  They get some crab legs.  Those people get fancy with their names.  Would you?  Oh, yeah.  Mr. Littman, oh, she was a great big four-legged person.  She liked her claws.  I'll go with you.  Mr. My mother's a crustacean.  She'll pay you. 
[02:41:00]  That's not Jameis, I guess, right?  Jameis Winston has been suspended from the university's baseball team after being issued  a citation for stealing crab legs.  He won the Heisman Trophy and he's stealing crab legs.  Winston was caught shoplifting at Publix Monday night and was issued a citation.  They are good.  Major Michael Wood said during a press conference that Winston told authorities that he just  forgot to pay the $32 for the crab legs and other seafood items.  Where do they have them? 
[02:41:30]  I don't believe he forgot.  It's kind of hard to forget to pay for shit.  Especially when they're in your hoodie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, man.  You put it down your crotch.  Crab legs?  Yeah, they're dead.  They're not going to fucking pinch you.  And there's no way to walk out of a supermarket without knowing you didn't pay.  Because you've got to either walk through the checkout thing.  Right.  Or you have to walk out the indoor.  The indoor.  Or, yeah.  You have them down your pants and your fucking cock is freezing.  Yeah, yeah.  You're getting poked.  Or you've got to go past that customer service thing. 
[02:42:00]  Right.  Where there's that little area.  You are right.  It's very hard to do.  Very hard.  I just forgot because I was walking past everybody else paying.  Yeah.  That's why they put the registers there.  It's to remind you.  Yeah.  Don't just leave.  You shithead.  It's just a college kid.  Even though he won the Heisman.  Just getting some free food.  You should fucking pay those guys.  I agree.  The amount of money they make for the universities, of course they should.  They should make.  And most of these guys will never make money off their sport.  They should just pay them.  He should have walked out the door with the crab legs under his arm with his arms straight out. 
[02:42:30]  Kind of sideways.  And what a dick, too.  Like, the manager of the store could have been like, I know who you are.  What the fuck is happening here?  Just take the crab legs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Give them the crab legs.  No.  Why not?  I know what you're saying, but no, if you're stealing crab legs, the manager's got to go  give back those crab legs.  Stop saying crab legs.  I like that word.  But it's a fun word to say.  I don't have the opportunity.  Just take crab legs. 
[02:43:00]  Fucking chicks, you fruck.  You should do fruck.  What chicks do I fruck?  I got excited.  I got excited.  I know.  Chicks, I fruck.  I got fucking excited.  Clab legs.  Crab legs.  I don't know.  It's fucking stupid.  It's sad that a guy who's that talented and achieved that much, which is insane, should  have enough money.  He should have money in the bank.  He might.  Maybe he just wanted to steal them.  How does he have money? 
[02:43:30]  I don't know.  What do you mean?  Maybe he just wanted to steal them.  Some people like stealing things.  I love stealing things.  I mean, it is a fucking, it's a high.  I've stolen stuff.  Recently?  No, not recently.  Jokes?  No, I wish I did.  I actually should.  Obviously.  He hasn't stole jokes.  Big ticket items?  I don't know.  I like that you did my joke better than me.  I know.  Sorry.  Big ticket items?  Or what?  It's rewarding for you.  No, when I was a kid, I was on the street, so I used to steal food. 
[02:44:00]  Candy was like money when you were a kid.  It was like bank robbery.  You were so excited to get a fucking candy bar and steal it.  Remember in the supermarkets, they had the big bins of chocolates and candy, and you could  walk over and just eat them at your will?  We have a handful.  I sampled throughout the whole supermarket to this day.  You still do it?  Do you know what's a great one?  I eat radishes, because I'm like, I'm not going to buy a whole bunch of radishes. 
[02:44:30]  I just want one.  You want a rad?  You eat a rad?  That's the fucking whitest thing I've ever heard you say.  That is everything in the supermarket you could grab and nibble on.  We're talking about eating chocolates and candy.  Well, those you got to wrap and stuff.  You're pushing your cart as you hop along.  Do you make a little doody in the cart?  Do you shit out little balls while you eat your radish?  I love a good radish, but I don't want to buy them, because I don't eat that many.  Who eats one radish?  I don't know.  How do you eat a raw radish? 
[02:45:00]  And then it's obvious that I pulled one off the bunch or whatever it's called.  I can understand the grapes.  You pass by those.  Oh, I do grapes.  Grab some of those.  That's rookie shit.  Even string beans and stuff.  Grapes are raddish.  Grapes, that's easy.  But you grab an onion on your way out.  No.  Yeah.  You don't like a good radish?  No.  Not a dirty radish?  I don't like a radish in a salad.  You can go fuck yourself with a radish.  I like a good radish.  And radish is a dirty.  You're supposed to wash them.  Of course you are.  Nah, I like the dirt.  It kind of adds to it. 
[02:45:30]  Just a little bit.  You ever just pick up a potato and lick the outside of it and put it back?  And grapes are easy.  I do grapes.  Yeah, those are easy.  Yeah.  Well, if you go to...  What's the...  I open up the blueberries, because blueberries can trick you, and I squeeze them a little  bit, and make sure they're cloudy enough?  Never buy them.  I go to the supermarket that has the little water jets.  You open up the blueberries, right?  The what?  You see the water jets that are over the fruit and vegetables, and it occasionally goes and  sprays them down with water?  Yeah.  That's the ones you go to, because it's like they're self-washing, you know? 
[02:46:00]  And then you grab a handful of fucking grapes or a radish.  What's the place near us, the supermarket that...  What is it called?  The one up on the hill?  A&P?  No, the one on the hill that has all the samples.  It's a million samples up in Yonkers.  A&P?  By the...  The Home Depot.  What's so many other supermarkets we got?  Shop, right?  Ralph's.  Whole Foods?  No, Sam's...  What's it called?  Sam's Club.  Food Emporium.  Stu Leonard's.  Stu...  Stu...  Stu...  Stu Leonard's. 
[02:46:30]  Stu Leonard's.  You want to go to a fucking...  You're a film critic.  It's...  All they do is sample everything.  There's a million people, and they're just sitting there with the most amazing fucking  samples.  With the little toothpicks and...  That's all it is, is samples.  Whole Foods does that here in New York.  Stu Leonard's will fucking blow any...  You can have a whole...  You can have a whole lunch.  Yeah, Stu Leonard's, same thing.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  You don't need to buy anything.  But you can't be like a homeless guy and just walk in, they'll be like...  No, you gotta like...  You gotta like...  You have a little variety.  You can't keep going back to the same station. 
[02:47:00]  But you can get a nice meal in.  I'd want to get full just standing there.  I have like disguises.  I have a mustache.  A different hat.  You just come back with different like disguises, but it's like a vegetable mustache.  You use some celery and broccoli mutton chops.  You come back.  Hey, I'd like to try that.  I come back with a radish in my nose with a cancer.  Opie's eating it.  A radish.  I hope you choke there because I'm using it.  There's so much to pilfer.  I don't buy radishes, though.  So much to pilfer. 
[02:47:30]  One every once in a while is good.  You have a cookie.  I can't even get a cookie.  Open up a fucking cookie.  Yeah.  Do you guys...  Look at a piece of bread.  Do you eat as you go and then have to like give them the wrappers to...  Why would you do that?  To skin the wrappers?  I've done that.  Do you have to piss off a Puerto Rican chick?  No, I wouldn't do that.  I'm trying to think of like, I don't know, like maybe a...  A condom.  A condom.  A protein bar or something.  Yeah.  And I'm eating it as I go and then I have to hand them the wrappers to skin.  I wouldn't just skin the wrapper.  No, I love getting away with things.  I'll steal a radish, but I'm not going to steal a protein bar. 
[02:48:00]  We put your parties.  Sometimes you wheel that cart out with a fucking case of beer underneath.  No.  Yeah, they don't see that shit.  And if they do, then you're like, oh, fuck, it was terrible.  Well, I thought you saw it and rang it up.  There's so many excuses for that under compartment.  I think it will come back.  I truly believe it comes back to you.  Comes back to haunt you.  Like immediately.  I've done stupid shit like that and immediately get like a flat tire. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, shit.  Or some fucking stuff.  Karma chameleon.  I believe in it.  The best is when I'm checking out and my kid is still in a cart or one of my wheelie things  that I wheel him into the supermarket with.  And get home to realize that, you know, they might have taken a few hours.  Oh, they might have taken a couple of things.  Actually, it's the...  Finsta, you naughty baby.  And what do you do then?  Do you go all the way back to the supermarket and be a good guy?  Or you go, ah, fuck it.  What are you going to do?  Maybe next time in there, you're throwing for it.  I didn't know.  What did your kid grab without you looking at him? 
[02:49:00]  A ham.  The candy shit.  Right at the register.  Case of beer.  It's actually Japanese chocolate candy if you need to know the exact thing.  What is it?  It's all right on the counter as you check it out.  Oh, the impulse buying stuff he grabs?  Yeah, right there.  That's why I love being out in the city, too.  The grocery stores are so much better.  There is a showcase of meat where I go shopping.  It's like you go up to the meat set. 
[02:49:30]  Poking through holes.  You can't say you're kidding me.  Is that a London broil coming through that hole?  Oh, my God.  Delicious.  That is so fucking good.  Ooh, I'll take that.  One of those.  I'll take the sausage with the sweater on it.  Oh, those come in a pair, I see.  New York City supermarket meat just looks sad.  Yeah, yeah.  It just looks sad.  Yeah, they don't even dye it.  It's just the original gray. 
[02:50:00]  And neither do you.  I had to get it off me.  Oh, my God.  I'll take it.  Jimmy, it hurt me deeply.  Do you know how fucking smart that joke is?  Do you know how fast you have to be to come up with diet, which is two fucking words,  and you put them into one and made them into a fat joke?  Oh, no.  That is fucking brilliant.  Sorry.  Jesus Christ.  That's a good one.  Wow.  That was fast.  So the meat's good, huh? 
[02:50:30]  Yes.  I love the meat.  Yeah.  There you go in there.  But, yeah, because the city supermarkets are so small.  The narrow little aisles.  They have those little carts that have to be small little carts to wheel them down there.  It's horrible.  And the hand thing.  I never use the basket.  When you walk in, it's like, I don't need enough for the cart, so I'll just have the  basket on your arm and fill that up.  I've never used the basket.  Yeah, because you fill it up, and then you're going to walk like a Guatemalan with it attached  to your head because it's so heavy.  I don't care if I'm getting three things. 
[02:51:00]  I'm a fucking cart.  I went to a super stop and shop, and it's like, what the fuck?  Aisle after aisle of fitness.  Aisle after aisle.  And the vegetables and the little spritz you were talking about.  Some dude with an apron that knows everything about everything in his section.  And just in his section.  That's it.  Oh, the bakery section.  And then they got the seafood and meats.  But then you got the little other grocery stores.  Like, I have DeChico's, which is just a family-owned place. 
[02:51:30]  And then there's an Italian place.  You go in, they still have the meats hanging, and some guy named Anthony will be like,  That's good shit right there.  What do you want to do the porcho?  Let me bring him in the back.  I'll tenderize him for you.  That's what you need.  A real fucking giggio.  In case you fucking put stuff in the back and you jerk off into it.  Enjoy.  There's some accountant on the table half cut up.  See, because he's a mob guy.  Yeah, you got to get out of the city, Ope. 
[02:52:00]  I would love to.  You got to get the fuck out.  I would love to.  I don't know why you live in that building.  You live in a hotel room with your family.  That's pretty much what it is.  That's what it comes down to.  Yeah.  No outdoor space, and these kids will drive you insane without a backyard.  You need to open a door and say, Go!  Right, go.  Where you can see them.  Yeah.  See them from a window as you're watching something.  Yeah, I did.  You need to get out of the city.  I'm ready.  Yeah, I never thought of that. 
[02:52:30]  In the city, your kids are literally with you the whole time, right?  Yeah, because if you go out.  You can't send them out to play.  You can't send them out.  You have to go with them.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's like your dogs.  Dogs, same thing.  Wow.  I had to walk my dogs three times a day for 12 years.  So in the morning, in the afternoon, and at night, you had to go outside.  Open that door.  And pick up the dog shit.  Now you just fucking go.  Open the door.  If they come back, they come back.  When we were growing up, we saw a coyote to fucking.  You'll pick it up when you're playing touch football over the summer, and you fall face 
[02:53:00]  first, and you're all, I miss this one.  When we were growing up, around our houses, right?  We saw our parents for maybe an hour in the morning.  Maybe.  Yeah.  Then you were gone.  And then maybe you would come back in if you were close to the house for a snack.  Yeah.  And then you wouldn't see them until dark at dinnertime.  And you're right back out again.  There's that video on YouTube about if you lived in the, what was it, the 70s, 80s, and  90s, you were a tougher kid.  Yes.  Because you didn't have video.  You had to go out and play and meet other people. 
[02:53:30]  Do you remember all the shit that used to happen that you didn't even bring up to your  parents?  It was just part of, you know, being a kid?  Do you think kids ring and run anymore?  No.  They're playing Call of Duty.  And remember how hard it was to make a new friend?  It was fucking nuts.  I think it's like, oh, this kid.  It's like, all right, I guess we're friends now.  You had to go find friends.  And then you had to come up with games.  You had to invent.  All right, we're going to take this ball. 
[02:54:00]  Monster Rain.  Oh, Jesus.  That was a fun game.  You had to play the shame game.  Some games are better than others.  But it was.  There was this whole fucking, like, um.  You had to socialize.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You had to work it.  There was a kid's socialization, Lord of the Flies thing going on.  What was the game where you'd be on, there was two bases, and you'd have to run from  either base?  Oh, back and forth.  What was that?  That was just called, um.  What was that called?  Not Tag.  Not Tag.  Oh, what the fuck?  I used to play it at my grandma's beach house.  Wasn't that something you had to say before? 
[02:54:30]  Oh, yeah.  Red Rover, Red Rover.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  Oh, come on.  Send the little, send the little feck you get over.  That game sucked, because the fact had always won.  Was it just called bases?  Tag was, you know, home base.  Maybe, I don't know, it was two bases, you had to run from one to, like, you had to run  from, and once you got to the base, you were safe.  You were safe.  That sounds like Tag to me.  But, no, there was, like, ten people doing it at the same time.  Yeah, so, like, yeah, you had to.  Running bases or pickle?  Running bases, I think.  Oh, pickle, not pickle. 
[02:55:00]  Running bases.  No.  I think it was just called bases or running bases.  If you tagged somebody that was running, then they were in the middle, and they had  to get something.  You remember that game?  Yeah.  I was more a, uh, just tag, or, um, play Army a lot.  In the woods, yeah.  Army?  Yeah, you know, you'd have your fake toy guns, and you, yeah.  You're just in your own backyard with a .50 cal.  Something brought in a bikini.  Yeah, pointing at a dinosaur.  Yeah.  Yeah, you can't talk about what you used to do.  You're still doing it.  You have a fucking toy helicopter, you know. 
[02:55:30]  You're a fucking child.  You're like a pedophile with full metal jacket fantasies.  Yeah.  When you were a kid, you actually worked on a farm.  You lived your life backwards.  You did manwork at 10, and now you're just a child in the backyard swimming all night.  As a boy, you shoot a horse, and now you're 58, and you want to play jackass.  On the patio, you're fucking crying, because there's no mustard for your hot dog.  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  When you were a kid, you hitchhiked across, you fucking filed your taxes on time. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah, I know, exactly.  You fucking drove a car when you were fucking 14.  Now you just have somebody drive you around, you baby.  Yeah, I am a baby.  You should have a big baby seat in the back of your fucking caddy.  I like toys to play.  I know, I know you do.  My friend Kevin out of Rochester just wrote me, he said, hold on, yeah, kids from a different  block were like a rival gang.  Yeah.  Remember that shit?  Yeah.  They'd be a block away.  Oh, yeah.  But they were like, it was a whole different crowd.  It was a whole different world.  Remember when you'd actually... 
[02:56:30]  But then when you would mingle with them, it'd be kind of cool.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And then your gang would get bigger.  Yeah.  But then when you had to figure out their tree fort and shit, did you do that?  We're like, hey, man, we're going to go...  Yeah, there was an instance, yeah.  Like you knew your woods and your tree fort, but then every once in a while, like, hey, we're  going over whatever.  It was like alien territory.  Right.  Oh, man, yeah.  I remember one tree fort.  The ladder was so fucking high up.  They put the tree fort way the fuck up in a tree, and I'm climbing this thing, and I  was a little kid, and I was scared pissless, but you couldn't, you know... 
[02:57:00]  You couldn't say that.  Yeah, you couldn't say you had to do it.  Well, we didn't...  We lived in the city, so we didn't have...  You're called a faggot.  We didn't have tree forts, so we...  I remember one time we dug a hole in the kids, but we were going to build a fort underground.  Oh, the underground forts.  But we got tired.  Crazy.  We didn't realize how fucking hard it was to dig a hole, so we wound up just digging  like a fucking huge hole in this kid's backyard, and his mom came up.  So instead of a fort, it was a shallow grave.  His mom came up, what the fuck did you do? 
[02:57:30]  All the grass.  We didn't know grass was, like, valuable.  Yeah, it's just grass.  It's just grass.  It's just grass.  It grows back.  What the fuck is she having a conniption for?  Did you ever break windows?  Me and my friend Dean used to run through the apartments, and we lived for just throwing rocks  through windows.  Jesus, no wonder you're fucking...  Kids do have an attraction to a breaking glass.  When you could throw a rock through a big fucking window.  The sound, like when you would haul off and throw it, and there was that pause while it  was still flying through the air.  Oh, fuck, I'd still love to go do that. 
[02:58:00]  That's it.  There's a lot of windows in New York.  Let's do it.  We used to pick up...  You remember the one-way street, and cars would park on both sides back in the day.  So there was room for one fucking car down the street.  We'd go down the one end and pick up a car and swing it into the middle.  And then the car would come down and get stuck, and then we'd run behind it and swing another  car behind it.  So it would just be stuck.  And there's no way they could... 
[02:58:30]  How are you picking up cars?  There's like 20 of us.  Friends of the Justice League?  You can pick up a car with 20 kids?  Yeah.  Fuck it.  We used to pick up cars all the time.  Pick up cars.  Did anyone ever drive off onto the lawns?  What do you mean?  To get away.  How did they get their car out?  No, you couldn't.  It was a fucking...  You're boxed in by four cars.  You're boxed in, and it's a one-way street, and it's cars.  They had to just beep their horn until the owner of the car would come out and go, what  the fuck?  Me and my friends did that with track the trailers.  You didn't.  No, you didn't, Chip. 
[02:59:00]  You didn't have a fucking trailer.  Couldn't happen.  Mother's a whore, Chip.  Very, very heavy, Chip.  I love being a kid.  Being a kid now must suck.  I don't know.  They're all inside.  It's all relative.  When you drive around in the suburbs, you don't see kids, right?  Nope.  On their bikes and shit.  Or in the backyards or anything.  I saw a kid playing, like, three weeks ago.  It was lonely.  It felt weird, right?  Yeah, he was, like, kicking some can with a stick, and then I was like, this lonely little  motherfucker has no friends.  But back then, yeah, but now they have access to everything. 
[02:59:30]  We didn't have computer games.  I would have loved to have had.  Me and my friend were playing television.  I would love computer games.  Yeah, but you would go out and play a game physically.  Like, you would go and actually do the game.  Like, you would play army.  Yeah, there was no Call of Duty, but you bought, like, your toy guns.  You'd have them, and you'd break up into teams.  All right, you're the Vietnamese.  Yeah.  See, with me, it was the Vietnamese and the Americans.  Right.  You know.  Koreans.  Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.  Koreans.  It was the Nazis. 
[03:00:00]  Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.  And then, you're hit.  No, you missed me.  Yeah.  You little fuck.  How do you miss?  There's no bullets flying.  Man, just suck it up and lay down.  Even if you sit at a table now, everybody's on their phone.  Yeah.  Like, even look, everybody's.  It used to be rude.  It's not.  Well, now, no, back in the day before phones, people would actually, you would have to talk.  Oh, God.  Because there was nothing else to do.  Like, oh, you just stare at each other at a table.  That is brutal.  You'd have to go, what's up?  What are you doing?  What happened? 
[03:00:30]  When I would go visit my friend Roy in Flushing, and it was my parents and his parents, they'd  get together, friends for forever and ever, and we'd go out and play and stuff like that,  but I couldn't imagine.  I was like, oh, how boring is it to be an adult?  Because they would just sit there at the table for the entire time talking.  Yeah.  Smoking cigarettes, drinking coffee, having some coffee cake and stuff, and just yapping  for hours on end.  But everybody's, you're so self-involved now.  It's all about you, and not about, it's like, what is my Twitter doing? 
[03:01:00]  What am I looking at?  What am I reading?  You're not even sitting there talking to somebody.  You had to, even if you fucking weren't, had to be interested in your friend or the person  across from you.  You had to listen to the conversation.  Look at the train.  Nobody fuck, a bus, nobody talks to each other.  The only difference is this.  Now, all you're doing now is what we used to do, but now it's visible.  Because we would always zone out and think about other shit.  Now you can just see somebody physically doing it. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, but there's a zoning out.  No, because if you zoned out in a conversation, if we were all hanging out at a table and there  was no phones, and we were all talking, and you said, what are you fucking zoning out?  We'd be like, what's wrong with you?  Yeah.  But now, I know what you're doing.  You're reading your Twitter feed, or you're emailing somebody, or you're reading some type  of website, you are about you writing.  Yeah, yeah.  Whatever was going on, you're like, fuck this.  I want to do this.  Well, it makes your person better be interesting.  Like, the guy you're out with had better be an interesting person.  Oh, yeah.  Like, that's how you, you know, otherwise you're both looking at your phones. 
[03:02:00]  I'm just a fucking drool then, because every time I look up at the cellar, everybody's  on their phone.  Oh, shit.  No.  And you just want to have a little conversation.  Well, that's the worst, too, when you're telling a story to your friend or somebody you're  talking, and then they, they, you look, and they're just in their phone, and they keep  looking at, yeah, uh-huh, yeah, yeah, what the hell?  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  People are listening.  It's just, it's really hard to get used to this ability to see everything.  It's really fucking hard, because you're getting news and information in real time.  It's, it's, it's, it's irresistible.  That's the cost of social interaction. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Even in a club, like, I get mad when somebody's on their phone.  Don't get mad, get even.  I, I used to get really mad when I would see some broad on her phone.  But now it's like, how do you resist the urge of instantly talking to your, or finding  out what's going on with your kid, or finding out what the fuck is happening later?  How do you, how do you resist that when you hear it buzzing in your fucking dumb purse?  Or seeing what they're saying about you on Twitter.  Could you imagine being a parent back in the old days? 
[03:03:00]  Hmm.  Do you have babysitters yet and all that?  We had one.  Well, you're out, and you could, like you just said, you could do a quick text, all right,  everything's cool.  You would have to leave the restaurant, find a phone, I'm going to go check in with the  babysitter.  Check in.  And then there were no videos.  You weren't watching, like, fucking, popping, popping in cartoons.  Could you imagine being a babysitter?  Yeah.  That would be fucking boring as shit.  I don't know how parents left their kids back then.  That's crazy.  It was just, you had to. 
[03:03:30]  It was just the way it was, you know?  It was great.  The shit that went on back in the day.  It was fucking fantastic.  It was scary.  He used to have sex with the babysitter.  No, no.  Joe was, he was just to make out with the babysitter.  I would drink.  How old were you?  We were kids, you know, fucking, I don't know, 11, 10, 9.  You really lived your life backwards.  You're fucking a babysitter.  No, I never fucked the babysitter.  Did you see your titties?  No, I wanted to.  Were you drinking casually at 9?  No, that was like a special thing. 
[03:04:00]  I didn't even like it.  That used to scare the fuck out of me to even just take a sip.  I didn't like it.  Just the fact that we could do it, the liquor cabinet.  But the babysitter would invite all her friends over, and they would be drinking and fucking  partying, playing music.  Did you, did your brother, was your brother banging the babysitter?  I don't think he was banging the babysitter, but he was, he was taking some liberties.  Taking some liberties.  When she was passed out?  The only consolation is half of those dumb fucking friends of hers that brought over  probably all dead in the nom.  Good for them.  Jesus Christ. 
[03:04:30]  Jesus.  I'm teasing, of course.  Let's go to Craig.  It's hard to get off your phone.  Everybody's fucking, you just, it's like you're just texting and stuff.  What the fuck?  Let me see it again.  What did he show you?  He just showed me a fucking brilliant picture of his cock.  Brilliant.  You know, they had to snap one.  That's what we do on our phone.  I tell you, though, Norton's got a good piece.  We've all seen his piece.  But it's a good piece.  Yeah, I don't think anybody has not seen it at this point.  Craig in Louisiana.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hi, Craig.  Kind of going back to what you guys were talking about, a few years ago, Jimmy told a story 
[03:05:00]  about an old man with chocolate ice cream, and I don't remember the details of it, but  I remember laughing my ass off, and I was wondering if he could tell that again.  It's with, actually, my buddy Stanley, who I've been in contact with.  I hate Stanley.  Who's, no, Stanley.  Stanley.  Stanley.  Who, he wants to meet up.  I'm going to see him soon.  He's a fucking steel bender, and I would hang out with him and his younger brother, and  when I was just when I was 13, we would do mischief.  And one of the times we decided, we were outside somewhere in a parking lot, and me and Mike 
[03:05:30]  were 13, and we found this fucking, like, picture of an empty dish of chocolate, melted  chocolate ice cream.  So we're walking around in this parking lot looking at open car windows, and we found this  open car window, and we took the melted ice cream, and we dumped it all over.  It was like a, one of those things, like the seat back covers, like a fur seat back cover.  So we dumped it all over that and then laughed, and we came out of the store, and we drove 
[03:06:00]  by the car, and there was an elderly couple standing in front of the car, and the old  woman was wiping Charlotte off her husband's back.  That's not right.  I know that that comes back to you.  She's wheezy laughing.  I'm just remembering.  How is that hilarious?  Just her standing there, and her wiping.  Oh my God.  The whole picture unfolded.  It unfolded.  Exactly what happened.  We used to find. 
[03:06:30]  Did you guys laugh?  Were you?  Oh, we couldn't have been happier.  It was even more than a laugh.  It was the victory you feel.  It was how Boston felt when they won the World Series.  Yeah.  And we used to go with margarine dishes full of oil.  What?  They would get, they had a pickup truck, and they would get like margarine, like a parquet  tin of, tub of motor oil, and then we would look for cars with open windows and just  dump it all over the dashboard.  Holy shit.  Oh, is that fucking mean? 
[03:07:00]  So we would dump it like on the inside of the windshield and all over the buttons and  knobs.  What a way to destroy the inside of the car.  We used to get rocks and put them in a motorcycle's gas tank.  Just fill them to the top with rocks.  You know the railroad train rocks?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'd get those rocks and just stick them in any motorcycle.  We'd just take the top off and fill the gas tank up with it.  Damn.  Yeah.  It was called Running Bases.  That was the name of the game.  I think that's what we called it, too. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  Running Bases.  Some were saying it was called Pickle, as well.  Pickle, no.  I think we just said, hey, you want to run bases.  Yeah.  I miss being a kid.  Why don't we start wrapping up here?  Fun.  Bobby's got a couple of great gigs coming up.  One tonight with Nick DiPaolo at Harris in Atlantic City.  Yeah.  Nick DiPaolo.  So you've got to leave now, I guess, huh?  Or soon?  No.  One o'clock.  You're going back home?  I've got to go home, yeah.  Oh, what a pain in the ass that is.  You should have brought your stuff in your head.  You should have just went from here.  Take the life.  Take the baby.  You go down.  I'm going back.  I've got to see the kid. 
[03:08:00]  I've got to do something else.  And then I've got to go.  I'm going to grab Nick, and we're going to go up together.  Okay.  Like two fucking men.  You're fucking fucking mom.  What about getting back to the stress factory?  That's tomorrow night.  Right.  So what are you doing?  I'm coming back tonight.  Oh, my God.  You're out of your mind.  Why?  I probably would have stayed there, drove in, drove right to New Brunswick.  Right.  I've got a kid, dude.  I can't.  Can you bring them or no?  I don't want to bring them.  No.  No.  If I had my option, I'd hunker in for a year and a half and not go anywhere. 
[03:08:30]  Really?  Yeah.  It's just because you get so comfortable with where you're at, your environment, and then  when you bring them somewhere else, there's a ton of shit that goes into that.  What's that one, Roro?  Additional Scenes Commentary by Mel Brooks.  Mel Brooks movie.  Blazing Saddles.  This is dirty.  What are they doing with this?  40th anniversary edition of Blazing Saddles.  What a funny movie.  Yeah.  Clevon Little is dead.  What are they adding to this?  Documentary and all stuff.  Mel Brooks commentary. 
[03:09:00]  All right.  Who wants mine?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Young Sam Roberts.  It was empty, and I caught it.  I wish it was a fucking glass of a kit, whatever.  Wow.  It really did.  I couldn't think of what I wanted to hurt Sam.  Like, what would be in that tin container that would have scalded him for life?  Jesus.  Stress Factory for Bob Kelly, yeah.  Tomorrow and Saturday night in New Brunswick.  I might try to make one of those shows.  We'll see.  All right.  And, of course, on May 10th, Saturday, May 10th, at the Village Idiot Pub in Patchogue, 
[03:09:30]  that's me, my brother Joe, my sister Dawn, and a bunch of the other guys from various bands  over the past.  We're going to be doing nice shit from everything.  70s, 80s, 90s, 2000s.  Yeah, she sends her ass off.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't understand.  It's like third-part harmony on some of this shit.  No shit.  Yeah.  It's fun.  So it's you, your brother, your sister, your partridge family.  Yeah, Joe Curry, Alex, Mikey. 
[03:10:00]  There's a bunch of Bill, Cowbell Bill, remember?  Is Joe going to wear that outfit?  I don't think Joe's going to wear the outfit.  What do you wear?  What outfit?  What would he wear?  His dress.  Oh, Joe Curry.  No, that's for Rotgut.  This is different.  What would he wear?  He would wear a dress and, like, a big chapeau.  And, uh, because he was out of his fucking mind.  He is out of his mind.  Yeah.  His little Rotgut band was a lot different.  It's a little nuts.  That's great, dude.  I want to come see that.  It'll be fun.  It's just going to, you know, hang out, play a bunch of old cover tunes and drink. 
[03:10:30]  What are you going to wear?  I'm just going to wear regular clothes.  You should wear, like, six shooters on your shirts.  Should I?  Yeah, well.  Okay.  Six, come on.  Eric Stang will wrote me, too.  Oh, no.  He said it's running basses.  All right.  He's funny, that guy.  He's very funny.  Very good follow on Twitter.  Very funny.  And also, Bob Kelly's got the podcast with Rycast doing very well.  Yeah.  You know what?  They're playing this weekend, I think, on your station.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  I think so.  And, uh, Roro, when do I get my Samsung?  Uh, in a week or so. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, or so.  Are we still white gloves?  Yeah, yeah.  He's coming there.  That glove's getting a little dirty.  We're not white gloves anymore?  Exactly.  I've been using it to fucking fist somebody.  Well, we want them, uh, ASAP.  I got the Galaxy Note 3, which I like, and I don't feel like it's that big anymore.  I love that phone.  I'm going to get the, uh, the Samsung 5.  I so hope iPhone 6 is big and fucking nice like that.  If it's not, I'm out.  I'm out.  Do you feel this is big?  Nope.  I want the iPhone to be that big. 
[03:11:30]  Are you a little tired of the iPhone?  I'm out.  If it's not big...  Aren't the apps that are on this?  Huh?  The apps are, uh, I think more reliable.  The apps are catching up, finally.  The functionality's more reliable.  The, the, the, I think...  I think the interface is a lot easier on an iPhone.  Yeah, absolutely.  Because you're used to it, too.  But it's just a learning curve.  Yeah.  When you first got that, and you're like, how am I gonna...  I remember you.  How am I gonna type with my thumb?  What?  I can't do this.  But now you can...  You're, you're fucking a master at it.  Kenny still has the BlackBerry, which he'll take out of its awful case.  He'll rub, like, he'll talk, and then he'll rub it to get his fucking cheek grease off 
[03:12:00]  it, and then put it away.  His cheek grease.  I turned everyone on to the iPad on this show, so...  What?  I did, too, actually.  You're out of your fucking minds!  Yeah, me and Jimmy.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Thanks.  Wait a minute.  Bye!  The Opie and Anthony Show has drawn to a close.  Stay tuned to reflect, relive, and get the story behind the story of the finest moments  of today's show.  Sam Roberts' Opie and Anthony post-show begins in moments. 
[03:12:30]  Screw that guy.  Hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  That's all right.  Your mom spoiled you.  Now it's time to spoil your mom with berries and flowers.  You can spoil...  Wow.  What?  Wow.  Now.  Now.  Now.  And look back on another legendary day of broadcasting.  This is the Opie and Anthony post-show.  Post-show.  With Sam Roberts.  Roberts. 
[03:13:00]  They're red.  Make it red.  Oh, it's red.  Make them red, baby.  Welcome to the post-show.  The Bob and Sam show.  Ahem.  Why did you do the ahem?  Huh?  I should have said ahem.  I interrupted you.  Oh.  So then you ahem.  Aren't you supposed to ahem before you make your interrupting say?  I don't know if any of the heads of the company are listening.  Oh.  Make sure they know?  Yeah.  It's the Bob and Sam.  Hey, what?  Hey, look who just showed up.  See you guys.  There you go.  Bye.  You never know what's going to happen here on the Bob and Sam show. 
[03:13:30]  What gesture?  Ah, Jesus.  That fucking chip sucks.  I wish you knew what was going to happen.  866-WOW1-WOW.  866-WOW.  9-6-9-1-1-1-9-6-9-1-1-WOW.  And you could be a part of the post-show today.  Why would you give the number out?  Because people, I mean, people don't realize that if you just spell it out like on a Blackberry  or whatever, it calls it.  Yeah, those people, you don't want calling.  The people that haven't realized that yet, that there's actually letters on a phone and 
[03:14:00]  you can spell shit, fuck them.  Well, what about the rotary phone people?  They don't have that anymore.  They don't even make it.  No?  It's actually illegal, I don't know if you know this, to have a rotary phone.  Why is it illegal?  Because it takes too long to call 9-1-1.  So it's illegal.  Illegal in many businesses.  Who's going to call 9-1-1?  It would take too long.  It would take too long.  Right, so you won't get caught.  That's too much.  That's a great impression of a rotary phone.  That's actually an impression of 9-1-1, not just the rotary phone. 
[03:14:30]  No, I know.  Because I did.  I got it.  I mean, it was really.  See, that's the thing about Bob Kelly.  What's up?  Detail oriented.  That's my thing.  That's your deal for day one.  Before you even thought of one punchline, it was like, first, let me get the details.  Yeah, I don't have punchlines.  I have details.  Right.  I have details that make you laugh.  There's no jokes.  There's descriptions.  Details.  Right.  A friend of mine went and saw you the last time, I think, you were in Atlantic City.  Yeah, Bob.  Right around New Year's time, maybe. 
[03:15:00]  Is that right?  I don't know.  Maybe.  You may have been in Atlantic City?  Yeah.  Oh, at Revel.  That sounds right.  Yeah.  You said you were very, very good.  I said, no surprise to me.  No surprise to me.  I saw that one coming a mile away.  Yeah.  So where are you going to be tonight?  Tonight, I'm at the Atlantic.  I'm at Harris.  Harris.  Yeah, they're running and doing a great comedy series.  They have really fucking crazy great acts.  And tonight, it's me and Nick DiPaolo.  That's a big show.  You're only doing one show, right?  One show.  Me and Nick.  Nick is one of the funniest guys on the fucking planet. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, he's just a killer, man.  He is a fucking killer.  How's his podcast been doing?  Unbelievable.  They did a show yesterday, you know, because unfortunately, the Artie Lang show got canceled.  Yeah, I read that.  Artie's show got canceled from DirecTV and all the stations and everything.  Yeah, got canceled.  But the good news is he was on, you can go to riotcast.com and get Nick DiPaolo's podcast.  And him and Artie did a show yesterday.  That's huge.  And it was great.  But it was hilarious.  And he actually talked about what happened.  I guess, you know, he, he, he's doing, he sounded great. 
[03:16:00]  Artie sounded so fucking good, too.  Yeah, it sounded great. </pre>
