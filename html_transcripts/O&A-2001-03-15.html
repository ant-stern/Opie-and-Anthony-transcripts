<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a deep dive into Bob Costas' HBO interview with Vince McMahon. The hosts and callers relentlessly mocked Costas, labeling him a "wimp" and "tool," for his criticisms of the XFL and WWF's content, particularly its sexually explicit nature.  They played audio clips from the interview, highlighting McMahon's aggressive responses and Costas' perceived unpreparedness.  The discussion included vulgar language and centered on McMahon's denial of an XFL pre-game show, a show Opie and Anthony themselves were involved in.  The Florida child using wrestling moves incident, brought up by Costas, was also discussed, along with McMahon's counterarguments.  Henry Rollins and Frank Caliendo were announced as scheduled guests.  The hosts heavily promoted their upcoming road show at the Vanderbilt in Plainview, emphasizing the "Musical Dildo Chairs Rock" event and the 21+ age restriction.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about censorship of pornography in Times Square, with callers Lydia and Christina arguing against it.  This segued into a humorous rant about the irritations of children in public, especially on airplanes, followed by a discussion about minivans and the challenges of parenthood.

Henry Rollins joined the show.  Their conversation covered a wide range of topics including parenting, American society's shortcomings (racism, homophobia, semi-literacy), school shootings, the impact of media, Napster, and Rollins' charitable work.  He shared anecdotes from his travels, and the hosts joked about his serious demeanor.  The segment concluded with further promotion of their road show, including details about the venue, age restrictions, and the inclusion of "smut" and musical chairs.

A chaotic segment followed, beginning with announcements about their upcoming Long Island show and its connection to a local radio station.  This was punctuated by calls from Edison, Scott, and a caller likened to a "George Carlin or Dennis Miller on steroids."  A heated exchange dominated the segment, featuring an angry call from "Vinny the racist" attacking Henry Rollins for focusing solely on the KKK.  This led to a shouting match with Opie and Anthony, escalated by calls from Gary, and involved extensive personal insults.

Frank Caliendo then arrived. The show devolved into a "Best Ass Contest," with various contestants displaying their buttocks while the hosts and Caliendo provided crude commentary and jokes.  Calls from Jim Florentine (opening for Caliendo) and others were interspersed.  Caliendo performed several celebrity impressions, including John Madden and Adam Sandler. The show concluded with more calls, including one about frequent caller Dice, ending with a Dice answering machine message.  The show promoted Caliendo's upcoming performances and teased online photos from the "Best Ass Contest."

Finally, a segment detailed the firing of an intern, Brian (or Bill Heathrow), for faking a motorcycle accident. His increasingly absurd explanations for his fabricated injuries provided much of the comedic material.  The hosts discussed upcoming events: the Plainview road show, a bikini softball game, and airing Brian's "accident" on their "Worst of Show" segment.  They promoted Caliendo's shows and Scorch's radio show, "The Kingdom of Nakedness," including its "Show Us Your Hole" contest.  Listener calls, filled with off-color humor, were interspersed.  Discussions about Marv Albert's sideburns and a hidden dead fish in the studio rounded out the segment, concluding with a call to action for the "musical dildo chairs" segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O&A Show.  Hey.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  Thank you, your line's coming.  We have a very busy show today.  Very busy.  So we've got to get right to it.  Henry Rollins will be in studio today.  Yes.  Hence the liar to start the show today.  I've been taking some knots for playing that. 
[00:00:30]  Cool song.  Frank Caliendo coming back on the show.  That incredible impressionist that did John Madden, Al Pacino, Adam Sandler.  Yeah.  He was really good.  He's coming back in today.  We're going to be announcing the road show.  Which will be happening a week from today.  A week from today.  So we've got to get our S together for that.  Yes.  And more importantly, 26 hours, less than 26 hours away from musical Dildo Chairs Rock. 
[00:01:00]  Can't wait.  And I think that's it for today, right?  And of course.  And the wonderful callers.  Yeah.  And the regular debauchery that you all know and love normally happens.  Let's start off with Bruno.  Bruno, what's going on?  Oh, hey.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  How are you?  You guys watched the show last night on HBO Bob Costas? 
[00:01:30]  Did we watch?  Of course.  What did we watch?  Well, what was going on?  I thought it was great.  I thought it was hysterical, man.  We were laughing so hard in the back office.  We watched it today before the show.  So to see Vince McMahon put Bob Costas in his place, you can't buy better entertainment than that.  I'm leaning forward to shut your mouth.  I think Bob had to change your shorts after the show.  What do you think?  Bob Costas, what a little wimp.  Well, he was all tough.  He was going to ask all the tough questions. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  And he wasn't ready for the answers now, was he?  At one point, Bob Costas is backing up in his chair because Vince is getting in his face.  Let me ask you one question, though.  Yeah.  Bob Costas, he asked McMahon about the game they showed, the pre-game show.  Yeah, we got audio of that.  And at first, McMahon's like, no, there isn't one.  Then he goes, yeah, but on week one, there was a show.  Right.  And then Vince is like, oh, yeah, he kind of backpedaled.  That's all right.  But here's the deal.  If the show was at the WWF restaurant.  Right. 
[00:02:30]  So how can McMahon backpedal?  Yeah, but Vince McMahon's not really involved with the WWF restaurant.  There's a lot to it.  We'll get into it.  It was, yeah, it was an NBC show.  It really was.  But Vince answered the question honestly.  It is a local show put on by NBC that affiliates picked up.  And Vince did not see the pre-game show.  We even asked him.  When we had him on and interviewed him in week, what, three, I think, of XFL pre-game,  he told us to our face he hasn't seen the show. 
[00:03:00]  I thought he was the one that picked you guys out, though.  That's what we heard.  That's what we heard.  All right.  I don't think he ever saw it, though.  Whatever.  He definitely did not see XFL game day because we asked him to his face week three,  and he told us he hasn't seen it yet.  It's on film.  I thought Vince was leaving you guys hanging for a little bit by denying all that.  Nah.  Vince has his own problems.  Yeah.  He doesn't need us alongside of those.  And I just think after what he did to Bob Costas, I think it was great. 
[00:03:30]  I like the part where he leaned forward and he pointed his finger at the guy.  I thought he wanted to strangle Bob.  It was great.  Bruno, I mean, you know, the fact is, you know, XFL game day wasn't setting the world on fire,  so we're not going to sit here and be insulted.  You know, it's okay.  It was what it was.  We had fun doing it.  It wasn't as bad as Bob Costas would like to think it was.  I actually denied any knowledge of the show in an interview last week.  I know. 
[00:04:00]  But, I mean, more importantly, just to see Vince McMahon put down Bob Costas was great.  That was awesome.  I mean, Bob Costas, you know, I mean, Vince said it all.  I mean, we have some clips.  We'll play it for you just in case you missed it on HBO last night.  It was great TV.  Yeah, Bob Costas came into the interview without doing his research.  He's talking about suck it and crotch grabbing and yelling suck it.  That made him look so out of touch.  Here you've got Vince McMahon on your program. 
[00:04:30]  You're going to interview him.  I mean, at least do your research.  Like Vince said, they haven't done that in over a year.  Vince is like, Bob, we even said that for a year and a half.  What are you talking about?  Right.  And when Bob Costas, you know, stated that to Vince McMahon, I'm screaming at the TV in  the back office like, oh, my God, you know, WWF hasn't done that in over a year, year and  a half.  Yeah.  And I'm so glad, obviously, Vince, you know, picked up on it and slammed Bob.  All right, guys.  Listen, good show.  I'm going to go listen to myself.  All right.  Later, guys.  Suck it.  Hangs up.  Is that Bob Costas doing suck it? 
[00:05:00]  Suck it.  All right.  Suck it.  Suck it.  We could probably find him saying suck it.  Suck it.  Suck it.  I like to suck it.  Suck it.  Nice.  All right.  Where's the audio of Vince talking about XFL game day?  Something that Anthony and I was hosting.  All right.  Here it is.  The XFL doesn't go anywhere near where the WWF goes, that it's a low rent form of television.  Have you seen any of the games? 
[00:05:30]  Tell me what is low rent.  Not so much within the games.  The pregame show, especially week one, was one of the most mindless things I've ever seen.  Thank you.  We don't have a pregame show.  Week one, there was a pregame show.  We don't have any pregame shows, which is one of my problems.  Anymore?  No, we've never had a pregame show.  What was the pregame show that aired in Los Angeles, in New York, and in other markets a half  hour prior to the first game?  A local thing that the NBCONOs put together, of which we had nothing to do with.  A little distance there, Vince. 
[00:06:00]  A little distance, but you know.  There is no, there never was a game day show.  But it was a show that was produced locally.  Yeah.  But he did know about it, because he said there never was.  Didn't he say there never was in that clip?  Come on, Vince.  Never was.  Fess off.  Yeah, there was a pregame show.  We're trying to get Vince McMahon on our show, and there's a good possibility it's going  to happen next week.  So, yeah.  We'll ask him some of these questions.  We'll talk to him about it.  I want to put his finger in my face and go, you shut your mouth. 
[00:06:30]  Right.  You want to hear some more audio?  Of course.  Bob Costas interviewing Vince McMahon.  This is Bob talking about maybe fixing the football games, because the XFL is so bad right now.  Right.  Bob Costas.  If you could be guaranteed that it would increase ratings, would you fix the games?  What a ridiculous statement.  It's not a statement.  It's a question.  It's a question.  I beg your pardon.  It's a question.  No.  It's either football or it's not. 
[00:07:00]  Now, if it's entertainment, then no different than I did a long time ago, when my predecessors  tried to pawn off that wrestling was sport years ago, you know, I mean, that's absurd.  And you came out and said it's sports entertainment and the matches are staged.  Right.  Absolutely.  So, how could you possibly script a football game?  You know, boy, you're giving me credit for a lot of talent that I don't think I have.  I mean, you have to catch the ball. 
[00:07:30]  I mean, you have to run with the ball.  You can't script football.  It's a great point, really.  Like, oh, could you fix the game?  What, are you going to fix a pass?  You're going to need some great actors to fix football.  Yeah.  He's got to catch the ball.  He's got to be able to run.  You know, it was so good to see Bob Costas looking like a complete tool.  He is such.  He was unprepared.  He's on his high horse.  He thinks he's the moral friggin' leader of sports now. 
[00:08:00]  Is that his place?  Let's go to Lewis.  Lewis, what's up?  Yo, dude, I watched that interview last night, and the one thing that busted my rear end was  McMahon just out and out, not admitting that he had anything to do with that.  I mean, granted, maybe NBC put it all together, but the guy knew about your show.  What, the pregame show?  Yeah, the pregame show.  Oh, we'll ask it for ourselves.  Yeah, that just blew me away. 
[00:08:30]  But, you know, I'm starting to think that Vince is getting too wrapped up in the character that he plays.  Because he was, like, bending forward, like, you shut up or I'll tear your head off.  You know what, though?  Was it a character, Lewis?  Bob Costas was scared S-less.  He had that look on his face.  He turned whiter than a frickin' KKK hood.  You ever been in school?  This is a perfect example.  You ever been in school?  You have the kid, like the nerdy kid, that finally stands up to the big bully guy, but gets his ass beat anyway. 
[00:09:00]  And he's got that look on his face, and he's so scared, but he's got to go through with it.  That was Bob Costas' face.  He looked, whenever they went back to his face, when Vince pulled his chair up and got right in his face, he had this scared look.  But it's my show, so I've got to kind of keep going.  But I am so scared that he's just going to pop me with his coffee cup.  Bob Costas should have realized that if Vince wanted to, you know, rape him, he would have.  Right.  Because nothing Bob would have been able to do. 
[00:09:30]  Bend him over his little chair.  I loved that last night.  Yeah, that was...  And, Lewis, you talk about characters.  Let's say Bob Costas is talking to De Niro, and De Niro plays that tough character and gets in his face.  At least Costas would be able to say, well, it's De Niro, and he's, you know, he's doing a little character thing, you know?  Yeah, but when the man...  No, no, man, we've seen Vince McMahon.  That is the real Vince McMahon.  Oh, yeah.  When you get him pissed off, he fights back, and that's what I love about him.  He's a son of a bitch.  Yeah, it was a cool interview.  It's just the only thing that really stuck me in the side that it is that he turned over on you guys. 
[00:10:00]  Well, we'll ask him about it.  Yeah, you've got to fuck his thoughts about that.  The things that are true are it was an NBC show.  NBC got together with the affiliates and thought it would be a good lead-in to have something XFL-related for their broadcasts.  It wasn't a WWF or a Vince McMahon show.  Well, and we should explain it further, too.  It was only supposed to be shown in New York.  Yeah.  So, I mean, the XFL, obviously, all over the country, and New York decided, well, this might be a cool little thing to help out the New York market. 
[00:10:30]  We'll do a little pregame show before the game.  But the fact that there was never a pregame show, or he doesn't know of a pregame show, that's bull.  Yeah, that's bull.  I stood there for, like, a minute with my mouth wide open and said, you lying little sack.  But, Lewis, you've got to see the overall picture here, okay?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No, no, no, no.  Hear me out, because, I mean, I know you like to joke around and stuff, but let me give you some facts, okay?  The XFL pregame show was shown in six to eight markets, tops, okay? 
[00:11:00]  The XFL games themselves were shown in every state in America and overseas and all that, all right?  It's the much greater picture.  Technically, there was no real pregame show for the XFL.  There was no pregame show.  You know what amazes me?  There was one in a few markets, but, you know.  You know what amazes me is that Costas, along with all those other empty-suit jackasses, couldn't see beyond, it was a screwed-up pregame show was the most pathetic joke I ever saw.  I mean, please, they didn't get it, because it wasn't what they would do. 
[00:11:30]  It wasn't that bad.  And I personally thought that the show rocked.  I personally thought that they were a bunch of jackasses, but not giving it a chance.  You know, you can't expect something to be successful.  You know, much in line with what McMahon said, you can't expect something to succeed in just four or five weeks.  I mean, come on.  Right.  Right on.  All right, folks.  Thank you.  Take care, dudes.  Bye.  We have more audio.  This is when it really gets heated last night.  Bob Costas and Vince McMahon.  And, yes, quickly, instant feedback, wasn't Vince on one of the clips in the pregame show? 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, Vince was on one of the pregame shows that never existed.  Friggin' Vince, man.  Well, I love, you know what?  I love the guy.  You've got to love him, though.  I mean, the attitude, where are you going to get an interview like this?  When you do this type of radio, you've got to appreciate someone like Vince McMahon that pushes the envelope.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  We'll ask him for ourselves, because there's a very good possibility he'll be on the show next week.  Dave, what's up? 
[00:12:30]  Hey, Dave.  Hello.  What's up?  All right.  Am I the only person that thought Vince McMahon was going to punch Bob Costas in the face?  No, everyone did.  Everyone thought.  I was waiting for something like that.  Especially when he shook his hand, he started grabbing his hand.  I mean, look how big Vince McMahon is compared to Bob Costas.  Oh, you know when the whole thing ended and they shook hands and Vince just squeezed down.  Oh, yeah, I know.  I thought it was one of the most hilarious things I've ever seen in my life.  He's got soft hands from counting money all his life.  And Dave, you know what's cool about that?  It would have been really cool to see Bob Costas take a shot to the face.  Oh, yeah, right?  But Vince destroyed him with his words, which I thought was great. 
[00:13:00]  But what really made me think about it, how Bob Costas was saying that whatever, that  murder about the kid trying out the wrestling moves, I'm sorry, but I don't think that's  feasible at all.  Oh, we'll get to that.  That was a big part of the interview last night.  Thank you.  I know.  It was one of the parts that I thought that Bob Costas was trying to put words into Vince  McMahon so he could say it back to him so he seemed like he's the right person.  Right.  Thanks, Dave.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  We do have that clip of the kid in Florida. 
[00:13:30]  Okay.  Here's Vince really going ahead with Costas.  If this turns out to be a grand scale failure, what impact will that have on you?  Well, you know, I get knocked on my keister.  I dust myself off.  And I get back up.  What do you mean what impact is it going to have on me?  I'm going to do the very best I can every single day.  I'm a fighter.  Okay.  I enjoy fighting, by the way.  So I like to fight. 
[00:14:00]  And he gets right in his face when he said that, too.  Yeah.  The look he gave him.  Yeah.  And then Costas went into the whole WWF thing.  This is really good.  Oh, it starts off with the clip of Trish.  Yeah.  Just in case you haven't been following the WWF lately, Trish, suck it up to Vince McMahon.  We'll do pretty much anything that Vince asked just to get herself some more popularity in the WWF.  Uh-huh.  And this is what went down on a recent episode of the WWF. 
[00:14:30]  No idea how far I would degrade myself for the right cause.  I would do anything for you, Mr. McMahon.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Personally, I love fantasy women.  Yeah, absolutely.  Fall around like a dog.  You want to prove your loyalty to me, right?  Now take your blouse off, Trish. 
[00:15:00]  Come on.  Take it off now.  What kind of man is this?  He's my hero.  I can't go like this to these days, and I'm going to get this deep punch.  I'm wondering what color panties you're wearing tonight, Trish.  You're sorry.  Take your blouse and take it off now.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  Oh, my pleasure.  Damn it, I said take it off, Trish.  He's going to do it.  Now, I should point out that, in fact, she did not remove her bride. 
[00:15:30]  You removed your sports jacket and draped it over her because perhaps we wouldn't want  to do anything that would be in bad taste.  Because I'm the constant gentleman, right?  No, I would never want to do anything in bad taste.  What's the possible justification for what we just saw?  It's part of the storyline.  What you see is a soap opera.  Bravo.  Now, you take me out of the XFL world, okay?  Now, let's take Vince.  Let's find not some of the other material which you could present from World Wrestling Federation 
[00:16:00]  Entertainment.  Let's find the most salacious, out-of-character kind of thing you can possibly put.  Let's edit it and put it right up here.  Not every moment is like that, but enough moments are like that for it to be fairly typical.  People crotch-grabbing, people grabbing their crotches, pointing in that direction, and  saying, suck it.  All right, let's stop right there.  This is when I'm screaming at the TV.  I'm like, Bob, you didn't even do your research.  They haven't done this in the WWF in well over a year.  Unbelievable.  He's so out of touch. 
[00:16:30]  And you're going to do a story on the guy.  At least know what the product is that he has out there right now.  And that ain't it.  The current product.  I got to say, the current product, that Trish thing, we were just watching it.  Probably one of the hottest moments on the show ever.  I mean, she looked great taking that off.  And the people are going insane.  That's what it's all about.  Bob Costas doesn't realize, oh, holier than thou, Bob Costas.  It was very titillating.  Like, he wouldn't enjoy looking at that. 
[00:17:00]  What male in this country, unless you're gay, wouldn't enjoy looking at Trish half-naked?  She had a little friggin' thong on.  That black bra.  It looked great.  What guy wouldn't want to see that?  Bob Costas.  It was a bathing suit, too, basically.  Yeah.  Close to a bathing suit.  Bob never looked at a Playboy?  Bob never spanked one out to something?  But he doesn't think it should be on TV, Anthony.  Oh, please.  Why not? 
[00:17:30]  It's what people want to see.  Jackass.  It's a simple concept.  If you don't like what you see or hear, rise.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  And then 12-year-old kids in the audience emanating that behavior.  Hang on a second.  Don't make me raise my voice here.  I don't want to do that with you, okay?  Even though you're doing it with me.  If you want to play that way, boy, I can play.  Yeah.  But when you get in a situation that you don't know what you're talking about because you don't watch,  you're no different than Phil Mushnick, who's some sort of moralist out there who writes about stuff, 
[00:18:00]  and he doesn't watch either, okay?  Phil Mushnick.  F-ing Phil.  Now, Phil makes it a career, just laying into Vince and the XFL and the WWF,  and he's another hypocrite.  Look at the paper.  Phil Mushnick's in.  I enjoy reading it.  It's the New York Post.  A lot of fun.  Phil is obsessed with Vince McMahon.  And writes an article on him once a week, Anthony. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  All just bashing and bashing the sex that's in there and the violence.  He's attacked us and our radio show as well.  Yeah, and the pregame show.  And if you look at his articles in the Post,  many times there's ads for strip clubs right on the same page as his column.  And gambling sites and stuff.  I mean, all the stuff that he criticizes for being on TV and everything else  is right there in the newspaper.  You know, what do you think?  Some of those pictures that they post in the Post are there because they fit the story 
[00:19:00]  or because the chick's cans are hanging out?  Okay.  And why doesn't he go to the Post and go,  you know, I will not work here because this paper has things in it that are against my belief.  Because he enjoys his paycheck too much.  Of course he does.  He's a hypocrite tool jack-off.  Those pictures are there for one reason, to sell newspapers.  Look at that.  I saw it.  He should clean up clubs.  He should clean up his own backyard.  You know?  No, he's too busy getting on Vince and, you know, other forms of entertainment 
[00:19:30]  that the majority of people and men enjoy watching for sexual content and action  and whatever else it is.  That's just the way we are.  But he's too high and mighty, but not high and mighty enough to go to his bosses  and say he doesn't want ads for strip clubs on the same page that his articles appear.  Let's see.  Flash Dancers ad.  Right there.  Nice.  Good.  Private Eyes Sports Cabaret.  The Upscale Gentleman's Club. 
[00:20:00]  Right there.  Slow Dancing, Table Dancing, and more.  All nude.  There you go.  Our adult fantasy playroom is open.  Nice.  Right there in the post-sports section where Phil Mushnick resides.  There's enough smut going on right around you.  Not that I mind.  Don't get me wrong.  Not that I mind at all.  I will frequent these clubs.  I don't care.  But what a hypocrite.  Well, clean up your own backyard first. 
[00:20:30]  Sure.  You're upset with this whole thing.  Quick.  Run to your bosses.  Oh, what's the matter?  The paycheck.  Oh, that's right.  Whoops.  Phil Mushbrain.  Jerk off.  Ass.  See.  And then when someone reads something that, you know, someone else writes...  Things don't happen?  They haven't happened?  You want to let me finish here for a second, pal?  I'm asking you the question.  Go shut your mouth and let me answer the question, all right?  I'll be happy to answer.  Go ahead and answer it.  Good.  So you've got a situation where you don't watch.  Come on.  How good is that?  How can we rewind that?  He tells him to shut his mouth. 
[00:21:00]  How great is that?  I love when these holier-than-thou guys get put in their place.  Oh.  Oh, you just screwed it up.  All right.  Hold on.  Now it's going to take a minute.  Shut your mouth.  Let me go to the phones while Rick gets that part of the tape.  Come on.  How good is that?  Sal.  Shut that radio off.  Sal.  Yeah.  All right.  Listen.  Everyone on hold, you've got to shut your radio off.  That's a delay you're listening to. 
[00:21:30]  Sal, what's going on?  Yes.  How are you doing?  All right.  You know, it's funny that you mentioned it.  You know, Newsday does the same thing.  They criticize McMahon and the wrestling and everything.  And then, you know, you turn the page over right by the box scores.  And they've got all the nudie balls and stuff.  You know, it's a bunch of balls.  They're hypocrites.  Yeah.  In the interview, Vince said, one thing about me is I'm brutally honest.  Right.  I like that in a person.  He knows what he is.  He knows what he's doing. 
[00:22:00]  And he tells you.  He'll tell you himself.  Thanks, Sal.  Hello?  Sal, come on.  Get with the program.  All right.  Here's Vince going after Bob again.  There, who writes about something.  He doesn't watch either, okay?  And then when someone reads something that, you know, someone else writes...  These things don't happen?  They haven't happened?  You want to let me finish here for a second, pal?  I'm asking you the question.  Shut your mouth and let me answer the question, all right?  I'll be happy to answer.  So you've got a situation where you don't watch. 
[00:22:30]  We haven't done watch-grabbing.  We haven't done that in over a year.  We haven't done the suck it chant, as you talk about, in about a year and a half there,  Bob.  Oh, at one time, it was part of the show.  Absolutely.  You did it.  Yeah.  And you know what?  This show that you're on right now, what precedes the show?  The Sopranos in this particular case.  Amen.  Another hypocrite.  Hypocrite.  Clean up your own backyard.  How about sex in the city?  How about real sex?  How about, oh my God, those real sex shows? 
[00:23:00]  You just see guys junk all over the place.  A lot worse than you ever see on WWF.  Why doesn't Bob go, hey, you clean up this HBO?  You're missing the obvious.  And if he gets into a...  You're missing the obvious.  What?  Oz.  Oz.  G-string divas.  I mean, and if he tries to push the whole thing, oh, well, people have basic cable, but  they don't have HBO.  Do you know anyone that's got cable and doesn't have HBO?  I don't know anybody. 
[00:23:30]  And you could parental lock any channel you want.  What an ass wipe.  I hate these people.  We haven't done box grabbing.  I mean, we haven't done that in over a year.  We haven't done the suck it chant, as you talk about, in about a year and a half there,  Bob.  Oh, at one time, it was part of the show.  Absolutely.  You did it.  Yeah.  And you know what?  This show that you're on right now, what precedes the show?  The Sopranos in this particular case.  Amen. 
[00:24:00]  How many times do you hear the word Sopranos?  That was great.  I like the show.  Okay.  It's a soap opera, right?  All right?  That's what we do in the entertainment world.  We're a soap opera.  Bob, come on.  And if you've ever watched soap opera, even on daytime television, compare that with also  HBO.  I love HBO.  But prior to Sopranos, Sex and the City's on.  How many orgasms were there?  Okay?  Your stuff is geared in large court toward youngsters. 
[00:24:30]  My stuff is geared for a broad demographic.  Okay?  A very broad demographic.  It's not on a pay service like HBO.  It's on basic cable.  Basic cable, not a pay service like HBO.  What's the difference between that?  There is no difference.  Because when you buy your cable package, HBO is thrown in there with your basic cable.  I don't know anybody that gets cable service from CableVision or Time Warner or whatever  it is and doesn't get pay services like HBO offered and takes the offer. 
[00:25:00]  You don't just get regular channels.  You get cable, you get HBO.  It's right there to flick to just like any other channel.  You can say, oh, it's a pay service.  Get out of here.  Everyone's got it.  It's on basic cable.  Right.  Basic cable, not a pay service.  No, that's a big difference.  It is a significant difference.  No, I don't think so.  People can say, people have said to me, I'd like to watch your show, but we don't have 
[00:25:30]  HBO in our home because we don't want our kids channel surfing past this.  It's real simple.  And to see stuff that isn't appropriate for them.  It's real simple.  On your channel surfing, go click.  Anyone who doesn't want to watch World Wrestling Federation Entertainment just turns it off.  How easy is that?  No one's being forced to watch it.  The question is, if you're not being forced to watch it and people enjoy it, then why are you, you know, why are you on your high seat here, your high chair with people who enjoy it?  You know, as a matter of fact, research will indicate that more families, you want to talk about the family hour type situation? 
[00:26:00]  Go ahead.  Well, this is going to, like, knock your socks off.  All right.  You ready for this one?  I'm ready.  Okay.  In a situation where a television show brings the family together, meaning more than just one person watching TV, the most watched family-oriented program, entertainment-wise, not a sporting event because, like, the Super Bowl does, outdoes this and stuff like that, is SmackDown on Thursday night on UPN. 
[00:26:30]  There you have it.  There you go.  There you have it.  God, this was better than an orgasm, watching this last night and today in the back office.  I just loved seeing Bob cringe.  Well, here's Bob cringing some more.  We recognize what we're doing and who the audience is.  There is an audience for something that doesn't justify it.  There's an audience for pornography.  There's audiences for minstrel shows.  How many people, you know, enjoy on a global basis World Wrestling Federation Entertainment that aren't elitist? 
[00:27:00]  Like you.  You know what?  As you personally know, I was a wrestling fan for much of my life.  I enjoyed the tongue-in-cheek type of soap opera that wrestling was.  And it could still be that, without the vulgarity, without the minstrel, it could still be, you know, you got your own show back here and you get paid for doing your little show and bringing people out here and being some sort of, you know, highfalutin type guy.  I'm down with that.  That's cool.  Because I love freedom of expression.  This is great. 
[00:27:30]  Okay?  I like this.  At the same time, you can't tell me how to run my business and what people want to see.  Because if they wanted to see your kind of wrestling you're talking about, that's what we would have out there, Bob.  Okay?  But as things progress, as you make it more of a soap opera.  Or regress.  Or devolve.  You can say regress, whatever you want.  You know, or devolve, whatever you want.  That's your prerogative.  Just like it's your prerogative not to watch.  Okay?  Okay?  God, he killed him.  Bob should do his next show with a dress on. 
[00:28:00]  The Florida kid stuff's really good.  I know this is getting a little long, but all cable is a pay service, isn't it?  I mean, you're going through it, you're getting, it's a pay service.  My God.  I know we're going a little long with this, but he makes some great points.  Recently in Florida, a 14-year-old boy has been on trial for killing a then-six-year-old girl,  using wrestling moves, which he saw on television.  I don't know if for sure he saw them on the WWF, but he could have. 
[00:28:30]  No one is saying, and there isn't research to back up any direct causal relationship between seeing that or seeing war movies.  But, does it give you pause at all to read something like that?  You're supposed to come here and know your stuff, okay?  And if you're going to jump me, and jump all over me, then you should have watched some of this.  And you should really know your facts.  I've seen some of it.  Vince, I've seen some of it.  Would you let me finish? 
[00:29:00]  Absolutely.  What I'm going to say there, pal, okay?  With a big smile.  This is amusing me.  No, it's amusing you.  You're amusing me.  Okay, good.  We're both amused.  It's your show, so, you know, you've got to have the forum here.  I understand that.  You know, I understood that when I came on.  And I've given you the forum as well.  So, to answer the question, if you stop to interrupt me, let me answer the questions here.  You've got a situation that you don't know what you're talking about.  Is the child not on trial in Florida?  No, the child's been convicted.  Right.  He's a murderer.  What an idiot.  He doesn't even know the trial's over. 
[00:29:30]  The trial's over.  No, the child's been convicted.  You're an ass.  I have to tell you that.  And if you'd have done the slightest bit of research, you would have known, you would  have known what the polling of the jury was, that this absurd notion that this child  was practicing wrestling maneuvers was a complete hoax.  Let me finish.  They rejected that as a defense.  Let me finish.  They rejected that as a defense.  Would you please let me finish?  Absolutely.  You know? 
[00:30:00]  You are?  Well, you sure?  You're not going to interrupt me if you let me finish?  Just because I inject something doesn't mean you're not going to have time to respond.  You've got plenty of time to respond and continue.  What a move!  I know this is radio, but what a move!  God damn it!  You hear the ice tinkling in the glass.  You can't learn stuff like this.  It's Vince.  It's classic Vince.  So Bob finally lets him continue and he decides he's going to take a long pause and take a drink  of water.  A drink of water after the whole, and don't interrupt me thing, let me finish. 
[00:30:30]  Bob Costner's like, okay.  And then he slowly picks his glass up and takes a drink.  You can't learn this anywhere, in school, nowhere.  Your parents aren't going to teach you this.  You're going to have it or don't.  Classic.  Listen to this.  Just because I inject something doesn't mean you're not going to have time to respond.  You've got plenty of time to respond and continue.  To the jury.  And he slams down the glass of water!  What a smartass.  What a smartass. 
[00:31:00]  God.  I hope you realize how brilliant that is.  You can feel that pause.  You can feel it.  You can't keep that.  So the jury says, sure, not only did we reject it, this had nothing to do with the murder  of this child.  As a matter of fact, from a defense standpoint, the attorney didn't even raise that defense  for quite some time.  That's what I said.  Now then, take it one step further and listen to what the judge had to say. 
[00:31:30]  The judge had to say the same thing, that this was an absurd hoax, this whole wrestling  theory.  This child, this six-year-old child, didn't die because there was horseplay.  This six-year-old child died because of the brutality of the 12-year-old, I believe, at  the time.  There was no practicing wrestling maneuvers, and you can't fool a jury and or a judge.  And they all said that this was absolutely an absurd notion, should not have been raised  to begin with. 
[00:32:00]  So those, and don't take it from me, go back and do something you should have done before  you brought me out here.  Go weed the facts, Bob.  Those are the facts, too.  Well, this guy Keith is a little upset.  Why?  I think you guys are great, usually, but you guys are really showing your ignorance and  what kind of white trash you really are.  The interview you are loving makes your hero look like a retard and did not get the better  of Costas.  I mean, okay, he's a Costas fan.  The point you are making is so wrong, I wish I could correct you, but you wouldn't get it. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, that's right.  Another one.  Keith, we couldn't understand your intelligence, I guess.  What?  Making our hero look like a retard?  No.  It's making Vince look like Vince, and that's what we're loving.  Whether he comes off looking like a retard or not, he made Bob Costas look like a pussy  jerk-off.  He is what he is.  He's real.  Yeah.  Bob Costas looked like the phony.  Nick, what's going on?  Nick?  I don't know how you guys can get up.  Going off on Costas and all these other guys? 
[00:33:00]  Right.  Yeah.  I love you guys to death, but you're fine.  Hold on.  Don't curse.  Don't curse.  We'll let you fuck.  I'm sorry.  All right.  You know, and Nick, let me explain something about our show.  We don't, you don't have to agree with everything we say or do.  Yeah, I hear you.  We're not here trying to convince you guys.  We're just giving our opinions.  We thought Vince looked great last night, and Bob Costas looked like a tool.  Oh, I think he made him look like a tool, too, because Costas shouldn't have Vince on.  All right.  It's too tightly different field.  All right.  So what's your problem? 
[00:33:30]  Because you're cursing at us here.  What's wrong?  I'm just pissed, because just the whole XFL thing, you know, I don't know.  You guys are sports entertainment, or entertainment, right?  We're entertainers.  We're like a Vince McMahon type.  Ah, that's part of what we are, sure.  Part of what you are.  And then going into the XFL and football, I don't know how you guys take that.  You know, I hated the XFL, you know, and I'm 17, so.  Right.  And I sort of fit in the demograph that they have there. 
[00:34:00]  So because of the XFL, we should hate Vince and what he stands for?  I think it was a great opportunity, you know, but.  What the.  I don't know.  I definitely.  What, our participation in the XFL?  Yeah.  We were hosting a show.  Yeah, I agree.  We didn't look that bad.  It was fun.  What the hell?  Why not just go do something for the fun of it?  Nick, I'm trying to understand your point.  Yeah, what's the point?  What are you trying to say?  I don't know.  You should just stop playing ping pong.  Basically.  All right. 
[00:34:30]  Thanks, Nick.  On you.  Okay.  We're just about done.  This is too good, though.  Come on.  It was funny.  You watch Vince just making Costas all scared.  I thought it was great.  Contribute in some way to a lack of civility and maybe even perhaps to violence within society.  I don't think it contributes to violence as far as a lack of civility.  Now, I'm sure, knowing you, your definition of civility and mine are probably two different things.  Perhaps.  Okay.  No, I bet on that one. 
[00:35:00]  Okay.  I bet on that one.  And finally, one more clip and then we'll move on.  But we were just so excited watching this.  It was too good.  I don't think that we in any way, you know, contribute to the violence.  Violence, to me, is just what I've said.  Guns and knives and rape and robbery and murder and that sort of stuff.  We don't do that.  What about degradation or objectification of women?  Generally speaking, if you stay with our storylines long enough, unlike you taking one little segment, okay, just to smear me, just, you know, just to absolutely smear me with this one thing. 
[00:35:30]  And thank you very much for that.  That's a real class move on your part.  So when you take that, okay, and you do that.  If I were to resort to your type of responses, it's interesting to see you lecturing somebody about class.  No, I don't have class.  I'm saying you're a strange one to be delivering that lecture.  I'm responding in kinds of the sort of things that...  So now you've interrupted me again, right?  Proceed.  No, no, proceed. 
[00:36:00]  You know what?  This is the Bob Costas Interrupt Program, right?  It's a characterization I think few would share, but it might work for you in this instance.  It worked for me.  I mean, take a look at the tape when you play it back.  How many times did Bob Costas interrupt Vince McMahon before he let him answer the question?  Just to try to keep you on point.  Go ahead.  Sure.  Oh, man.  That's pretty much it, right?  Just the end.  All right, these are real quick.  Let's end on this.  We have to end. 
[00:36:30]  I'm having fun.  We have to end.  I'm enjoying it, too, but Bob Knight is waiting, and he deserves his time as well.  It's Coach Knight.  Coach Knight is waiting.  It's Coach Knight.  Vince, we've got to go.  Oh, it's too bad.  This is such a delightful show, Bob.  Thank you so much for having me on.  I appreciate your coming on.  Oh, it's a great...  Thank you very much.  And there is more just ahead, my friends.  Right there.  He's squeezing his hand as hard as he can, I bet.  Whatever.  There you have it, I guess.  I thought it was funny.  I think people are...  Some people... 
[00:37:00]  Most of the people get what's going on, but some people are getting the wrong idea.  What?  It's not like we're rah-rah-ing behind Vince or anything.  I found the interview entertaining.  I thought it was funny.  I thought it was Vince McMahon being Vince, which is funny.  It has nothing to do with us being on XFL or associated with it in any way.  I could give a crap.  It was just funny to watch and to listen back to now.  I took great pleasure in seeing Bob Costas look like... 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  You know?  Right.  Here's a guy that didn't do the basics and just likes to do research on the guest that's coming in.  Yeah.  That's all I'm trying to say.  You know, we have careers without Vince McMahon.  Yeah.  We don't need to suck up to Vince McMahon.  It's just he's...  It always comes across as very funny whenever he's on TV.  No, why?  Because he's brutally honest.  Yeah.  He doesn't hide behind things. 
[00:38:00]  It's just him going from trying to get his points across to Bob Costas to then them playing that clip.  Take off your blouse.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Fall around like a dog.  And then they come back and it's like, okay, now that's the Vince that's in your head.  Now he's trying to make his point.  Now take your blouse off.  Come on.  Take it off now. 
[00:38:30]  Kevin, what's going on?  How you doing?  How's it?  What's up?  What's up?  This guy that called me for, he was talking about how Bob Costas,  is supposed to be talking about what he knows.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  The guy goes on and he tries to set him up, set Vince McMahon up.  And Vince McMahon comes off.  He's well-spoken.  He knows what he's talking about.  He has all the facts right.  And he just, it's the opposite.  Yeah.  You know, and I mean, I'm not even a big wrestling fan.  I'm like from the old school wrestling in the old days with, you know. 
[00:39:00]  Bruno San Martino.  Yeah, Bruno, all the old guys.  Ivan Putsky.  And I really don't watch his stuff today much.  But I'll tell you, it's all melodrama.  Just like Vince said.  And it's just for entertainment value.  You enjoy it.  And this guy tries to crucify him.  Bob Costas made himself look like an ass.  It's a soap opera, you know.  Absolutely.  It's enjoyable to watch.  I'm enjoying the storyline with Trish.  I've been watching it a lot more lately because of that.  Yeah.  I'd like to watch it a little more if I had the time to get into it a little more. 
[00:39:30]  But, you know, I don't.  But, I mean, it's still.  Take it for what it's worth.  It's entertainment.  You enjoy it.  All right.  That's it.  You got it.  Take care, guys.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  We got to get to some other things, huh?  Chris, real fast.  Chris, we got to wrap this up here.  First, you're dopey and he's ain't funny.  Oh, God.  That one.  Wait a minute, dude.  Let me tell you something before you even move on.  Chris, we heard that one probably seven years ago in Boston. 
[00:40:00]  Come on.  It is probably the oldest one out there.  Let me get to my point then, all right?  Because that was just absolutely awful.  First of all, wrestling is the stupidest form of entertainment.  I'm embarrassed for a country in the world to even watch that crap.  All right.  Number two, this man skirted the topic.  The fact that when you were a fan a long time ago, wrestling was focused on what kids  could understand.  When we told you, brother, I'm going to pick his ass. 
[00:40:30]  Whatever.  That's what they talked about.  Now there are people looking at him.  Chris, Chris, can I wait?  Chris, Chris, Chris, slow down.  Okay.  I'm all excited.  All right.  I'm all worked up in the fast way.  I'm sorry.  I've been watching wrestling my entire life.  Don't ever, don't say it was, wrestling was ever for kids.  Maybe the Hulkamania stuff in the wild.  When I first started wrestling, those guys were bleeding like mother-effers.  Yeah.  They were cutting themselves.  But that's not adult topics.  You know, the first woman walking around with her breath hanging out, to me, was Elizabeth 
[00:41:00]  with the martial man.  But you said when, you know, wrestling back in its day was meant for kids.  I just gave you an example where I remember seeing Bruno Sammartino and Chief J Strongbow  and these guys bleeding like crazy.  That's wrestling.  It wasn't so much as a soap opera, Mr. McMahon.  So why did it...  It was more of wrestling and blood and...  All right.  Hold on.  Chris, why does it bother you and why don't you just not watch it then?  I don't, man.  I just, I like a show.  All right.  You know, I'm embarrassed for my, for everyone I know that watches that time. 
[00:41:30]  Hold on.  You can't curse.  Come on, man.  So why do you, you know something, the ratings, I don't watch it myself anymore, to tell you  the truth.  But the thing is, there's still a lot of people that are watching it.  So who are you to say you're embarrassed by him or you don't...  You guys are talking so much about how he did well.  I'm sorry.  My cell phone's cutting out.  I don't know if I'm interrupting you, but do you think he interviewed so well?  I think he skirted the issue. 
[00:42:00]  To call it progression...  Did we say it was a good interview by Vince or was it entertaining, which said, God, listen  to me.  We said it was funny to listen to.  Bob Costas is this poor little guy that was all scared.  It was funny to see Costas scared.  And you know, Vince also made some really good points.  God.  Was it a great interview?  Probably not.  Well, you know what, man?  I want to say you guys have a good show.  And that dumb joke earlier, it's weak.  It was weak.  Have a good day.  Thanks.  Here's a guy.  All right. 
[00:42:30]  Let me tell you what he's all about.  He's a parent now.  And it's...  Anytime he sees any sex on TV, he loves it because he's a guy.  But he's all...  He's all engrossed in his kids.  All you people with your children make me effing sick.  We got to all now put what entertains adults away and take it off TV and radio and everything  to make this into Barneyland or something.  Put your kids in a friggin' closet and duct tape it shut or something.  Get them out of my face. 
[00:43:00]  I don't have kids.  I want porno on my TV.  I want violent video games.  I want violence on TV.  And I don't want to be...  I don't want to take it off because you had kids.  Go screw.  Take your bar off and hear it.  Buy your Barney tapes and put them in your VCR.  Stick your little drooling tea factories in front of it.  And let me watch my violence and sex.  Bingo.  I didn't decide for you to have kids so it could screw up my entertainment. 
[00:43:30]  I'm tired of it.  America.  Get on your hands and knees.  I'm wondering what color panties you're wearing tonight.  Right.  Put your kids in the closet and shut up.  Two quick things.  Wrestling always had a soap opera element to it.  Yeah.  And it was always edgy.  Right.  Right from the beginning.  Exactly. 
[00:44:00]  Turnp off.  Guys try to say that it used to be for kids.  Kids.  Well, tricks were for kids too and the rabbit got it occasionally.  Right?  Am I wrong here?  Unbelievable.  No.  Dan from Hoboken.  You're not getting me back on this all along.  More violence and sickness going on with boxing than wrestling.  Yeah.  Something I'm sure Costa supports.  And real life. 
[00:44:30]  There's plenty of sex and violence going on on real life, on the news, on everything else.  What do you think?  What do you think?  They just put the sex and violence stuff on the news because it's news and it's happening?  They know it draws ratings in.  What's that line from that 15 minutes movie?  If it bleeds, it leads.  That's the...  And what do you think?  They made that up for a movie?  I'm sure that's commonplace in all the news...  All the unnews stations.  If it bleeds, it leads.  Nakedness.  Nudity.  Whatever.  They love it on the news. 
[00:45:00]  Ass apps.  That was a great speech, Ant.  Let's take a break, okay?  We have to talk about Henry Rollins coming in.  Yeah.  Henry's going to get into some of this stuff today with us.  Yeah, he's somebody that has a unique take on life.  Yeah, we'll get into that.  He's very interesting.  Yeah.  Frank Caliendo coming in.  Great comedian that does a lot of really funny...  Impressions.  You might remember him from his last appearance on our show 
[00:45:30]  doing John Madden and Al Pacino and Adam Sandler and all that.  He killed and he's coming by to say hi.  And we also have to talk about musical dildo chairs, Anthony.  Speaking of why, the winner of that will be going to...  WrestleMania in Houston.  Yeah!  WrestleMania is going to kill this time around  and it's going to be on pay-per-view, okay?  Someone's mad at me.  Why?  Anthony, put my kid in the closet, violence and porn on TV.  F you and goodbye. 
[00:46:00]  I'm done with your show, scumbag.  What language are you using?  What if a child was walking by this computer?  And I didn't say just put him in.  I said put him in and duct tape the door shut.  Hello?  Yeah.  Who's this?  This is Jack.  Hey, Jack.  What's going on?  I've got to agree with Anthony.  I'm embarrassed to say it, but I'm a parent.  I have two young kids.  And my values have changed.  Absolutely.  I'm careful about what I want my kids to grow up to see. 
[00:46:30]  So it's your job to make sure they don't say it.  It's not your job to take it off for the people that decided not to have kids  to take away their entertainment.  Absolutely.  And I do travel and for business.  I go on the road or I'm happily married,  but as soon as I get to my hotel at night,  first thing I put on is Spanktivision to see what porno's going with,  so I'm missing that out at home.  Spanktivision.  Well, you're doing your job, too.  You're doing some parenting.  And when I'm home, there's no pornos in the house.  I got rid of them a year ago.  I had to cancel my Playboy and 10th house. 
[00:47:00]  She won't even let me get Maxim, which is kind of ridiculous.  Wait a minute.  Oh, she won't?  Wait, you can't even read Maxim?  Well, I can't get the subscription at home.  Oh, wow.  You see, women are responsible for this, too, people.  I'm not going to let them off the hook.  The men become so pussy whipped,  and a lot of them are very into the kids and what they should see,  but it's the women that get on the bandwagon  and try to get it taken off the TV and everything else,  like the PMRC and all that happy horse crap.  A-poo-sa!  A-poo-sa! 
[00:47:30]  The ones with the a-poo-sa!  Go through the chronological.  When I was dating my wife, I had Playboy.  I had Penthouse.  We lied in bed together.  We admired the pictures.  We even read the articles.  There you go.  We get engaged.  We still have them.  We get married.  I still have them, but she gets pregnant.  You know, maybe you want to stop renewing your membership  you've had for the last 10 years.  Oh, my God.  I don't know about that, but what are you going to do?  I'm a tool now.  I'm a freaking hooky whipped tool.  Oh, God.  A beaten man. 
[00:48:00]  Do you drive a minivan, my friend?  Oh, Christ.  You want to get pregnant again, and that's the next thing.  A minivan.  Once you're in that minivan, it's over, John.  He's so embarrassed.  So embarrassed.  All right, bro.  We'll let you go, man.  What bastard.  We'll let him go.  Ross, what's going on?  Hello?  We're trying to take a break.  This is the longest we've ever gone without a break.  Ross.  Yeah, man.  I want to know why these stupid idiots in this wrestling world still try to pretend like  it's real.  No, I don't think anyone is.  I think everyone knows it's entertainment. 
[00:48:30]  It's entertainment, but up until a couple of years ago.  You know, they always.  No, up until about 15 years ago.  They have all this secrecy around it.  They try to protect all their stupid little storylines.  It's like any other show on TV.  You turn on TV, you turn on a soap opera, like Vince was saying, in the afternoon.  What are you going to see?  You're going to see sex.  You're going to see rapes.  You're going to see abductions, murders.  That's part of the soap opera.  That's storyline TV.  If they had that on wrestling, you think it would be better or worse? 
[00:49:00]  They have it on wrestling.  They have a lot of those elements.  But what's the difference?  There's no murders and rape on wrestling.  Vince made sure he mentioned that.  Thank you, Ross.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Lydia.  Lydia.  Yes.  What's up?  How are you guys?  Hey.  Well, you know, as far as this whole wrestling business is concerned and all that stuff,  it's been around forever and ever.  It's never going to go away.  It's going to come back in different forms, no matter what it is.  And you just take it for what it is. 
[00:49:30]  And it's going to be here because the public wants to see it.  Exactly.  I mean, you know.  This is what we want to see.  Right.  For whatever reason.  Right.  Because somewhere along the line, life got boring.  Yeah.  And we need this type of entertainment to get us through our days.  Oh, sure.  Something where you don't have to think at all.  And it's not just the wrestling because a lot of people are like, oh, wrestling, I don't like it.  It's a lot of other things that you do in life that you enjoy.  If you like looking at naked pictures, screw it. 
[00:50:00]  Why shouldn't you be able to?  If you like the violent video games, why shouldn't you be able to play them as an adult to go in?  And if you're a kid, your parents should keep tabs on what you're playing if they have a problem with you playing those games.  Anthony, I'll tell you why.  I totally agree with you.  The violent video games are the reason why there's school shootings.  Oh, yeah.  That's what it is.  No, that's what the media told me.  Sure.  Sure.  I believe it.  Well, take away the games then.  Sure.  I agree now.  Guys, I'm a parent.  Yeah.  I have a two-year-old child.  Yeah.  And, of course, I want to, you know, keep certain things out of his way. 
[00:50:30]  And that's your job as a parent.  Right.  It's your job.  My mom busted her ass to bring us up right.  Right.  But that doesn't mean I have to take away...  We have some wacky stories.  But you know what?  My mom did her job, and she was a parent.  Oh, sure.  And she made some incredible sacrifices.  But that doesn't mean that you have to take away things for yourself as adults.  Right.  Right.  Of course not.  But that's what a lot of people want to do.  No.  They shouldn't do that.  You know what?  The thing is, is you want to, you know, have discretion for yourself then.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  You don't want to look at porno? 
[00:51:00]  Then don't.  You don't want to, you know, watch violence on TV?  Then don't.  Then shut it off.  You have that right to do that.  But don't take that away from other people that want that stuff.  The people that have the biggest problems with this stuff are the people that are so hung  up on it and so obsessed with it.  When you get an activist that is so against any kind of pornography, any kind of nudity,  they are the people that are so hung up on it that they can't handle themselves.  They go crazy.  Right.  So they assume that everyone acts like this and goes berserk when they see nudity, so 
[00:51:30]  they have to take it all out of Times Square.  Well, you know what the thing is?  These are people that have never masturbated.  Oh, there you go.  Loosen up.  Pop the cork.  Okay.  They've never done it themselves, so why would they want to watch other people do it?  Exactly.  All right, Lydia.  Thank you.  Sure.  One more lady, and then we really got to take a break.  Christina, Ben's freaking out.  Christina.  Hi, guys.  Hi.  I just wanted to say that I agreed with Anthony.  I'm only 22, and I don't have any kids yet, but I grew up, and my dad had his thing of 
[00:52:00]  pornos and stuff, and I just think that it's a huge, huge cop-out for people to, the huge  activists who are trying to take away stuff.  And I think there are a lot of people with deep-rooted issues who, you know, are just  looking for things to blame that, you know, realistically, it's their parenting skills.  Yeah.  Things like entertainment.  I think entertainment evolved into what it is because that's what people want. 
[00:52:30]  Exactly.  If people didn't want it, it wouldn't be here.  Who the hell wants to see a Fred Astaire movie?  Yeah.  Who, oh, I want to go to the movies and see a musical where people just break into song  out of nowhere.  No, I want to see action.  I want to see some smut.  Exactly.  I mean, I'm a female, and I like porn as much as my boyfriend.  Yeah.  It's just, you know, I think that kids should definitely be protected from some stuff, but  I think that banning it is not the answer.  Once the kid slides down that fleshy water slide, it's all over. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, yum.  You know what?  See, it's by hiding it.  You're creating a whole new pool of problems, you know?  We the people will decide when we don't want to watch WWF anymore.  But you're going to start reading the preamble to the Constitution.  We the people.  But that's what it is.  It's there because we want to see it.  And if there's not enough people watching the WWF, guess what?  It's going to go away.  Just like anything else. 
[00:53:30]  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  Just like XFL Game Day.  If there's not enough people watching, it'll go away.  You know why there's no doo-wop on the radio anymore?  Because no one wants to hear it anymore.  Right.  It's just what it is.  It's easy, guys.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  Let's take a break.  Yeah, but after that rant of yours, man, you got people riled.  All right.  Roadshow.  Details next.  Musical. 
[00:54:00]  Dildo.  Chairs.  Details next.  Hey, New York.  This is Vince McMahon of the WWF, and you're listening to the greatest tag team in radio.  Opie and Anthony on 1027 WNEW.  Ah, some Henry Rollins in the background.  Opie, I got to give props to somebody that works here.  Pete.  Pete the engineer.  Pete the engineer.  What do you see?  Oh, my God.  What do you see?  Holy cow.  You know, when he doesn't have a dildo, you know, strapped to his forehead. 
[00:54:30]  A chin dildo.  He's a pretty talented guy.  I have my own headphone jack.  It is right here by my seat.  And I can adjust the volume accordingly.  And I give it till tomorrow, till you crack your knee into it and you start complaining.  No.  Not even near the knee.  Great job, Pete.  Thank you.  Henry Rollins is going to be in studio in seconds.  Here's somebody that could talk about what we were just talking about. 
[00:55:00]  He's got great timing.  He can get right into this discussion.  He's got a CD out.  Spoken word, Anthony.  I'd like to know what his feelings are, this whole parental thing and entertainment for  adults and having to temper it for kids.  Whether you have them or not, we all got to deal with other people's kids.  I don't even like dealing with them in movie theaters, airports, or anything else.  I made a conscious decision not to have kids.  And you sit down at a movie and you just, oh, great. 
[00:55:30]  Movie's starting up.  You're going to have a great time.  I've been waiting for this one.  Oh, good, good.  Oh, you took your kid to the R-rated movie.  That's good.  Because you couldn't find an effing babysitter.  Because now you get the price of a movie and a babysitter all in one.  Oh, why not?  You want to wrap him in the head.  Or then flying back from California that time?  Remember that?  With the baby right behind me?  Oh, I was praying for the scene out of Castaway. 
[00:56:00]  You don't have all the details of that story.  We're flying back from L.A.  The baby cried for half the flight.  Then the baby fell asleep for a good start.  No, I found some chlorophyll.  The baby fell asleep for like two straight hours.  The mom, as we're making our approach to JFK, decides to wake up the kid.  So now the kid starts crying for the last 40 minutes of the flight.  And it's like, oh, the baby's ears are popping.  Oh, with his head popped. 
[00:56:30]  Enough with the crying.  They ought to have a separate section, I think.  It's called cargo.  Ian.  Hey, Ian.  Yeah.  What's up, man?  You guys got to help me, man.  What's the problem?  I'm picking up my first minivan tomorrow.  Rock.  Sucks.  When I was 20 years old...  Shut up, jerk-off face.  Wait, what happened?  They caught me.  I went reaching over to turn my volume off.  What can I say?  They jumped out of that. 
[00:57:00]  Ian, sorry.  Back to you.  When I was 20 years old, I was driving a 71 Chevelle with a big crag of tires on it.  And now I'm picking up a minivan tomorrow.  Tomorrow you pick up your minivan.  I pick it up.  Oh, I'm so excited.  You know what the down payment is on those things?  You're balls!  You know how much they go?  A lot of money.  Yeah, I know, but they look so cool these days. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, I know.  Mine's got a roof rack, too.  You see the way they try to sell them now?  It's like it's almost an SUV.  Yeah.  Yeah, I got...  Sure.  The salesmen know, because I walk in, you know, and if they know, because my head is hung low,  and the guy's like, oh, yeah, yeah, minivan, but it drives like a Lexus.  I'm like, yeah, but it's a Lexus, but it's a minivan.  It doesn't matter what it is.  It drives like a Lexus.  It's a Toyota.  It's no Lexus.  It drives like a Lexus if you were a real big pussy.  It's amazing. 
[00:58:00]  Well, good luck with you in the minivan.  I'm going to go listen to myself then.  All right.  That old gag.  Cool.  Let's move on here.  It's WNW.  John, what's going on?  John is proud of his minivan.  John?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I'm here.  What's up?  Hey, man.  I'm 29 years old.  I'm a regular guy.  Wrestling, football, the whole shooting match.  Loving it.  Hey, man.  Ain't no shame in your game.  You got a minivan?  Drive it.  Ain't no shame your game? 
[00:58:30]  No shame in your game, brother.  No shame in your game.  Dude, you drive a minivan.  You shouldn't be trying to talk all cool.  Hey, John, you convinced me.  I'm going to go out and get one.  I'm doing my best out here.  I got two kids.  My brother-in-law tries to tell me how cool his minivan is.  Yeah, everyone with a minivan tries to tell you how cool it is because they have to justify it to themselves.  This thing drives like a car, man.  It's my Cadillac.  I got none of my best.  I have a monitor and a VCR in here.  All right.  It's backed up. 
[00:59:00]  Boom.  Video.  I'm alone with my wife.  Boom.  Porno.  Come on.  All right, John.  Thank you.  Yeah, porno.  Sure.  Yeah, that's what's going on.  Yeah.  The Barney tapes are going on.  I got the kids.  There's Barney tapes.  There's candy, sticky stuff all over the back seat.  Blue cruise or blue clues.  Blues clues.  Blues clues.  Crayon marks so your kids are coloring your back windows.  Blue goods.  Blues clues.  Goose.  Spooge.  Well, my brother-in-law does that to me.  He tries to, you know, he tries to tell me how cool his minivan is. 
[00:59:30]  I'm like, look, look, Mike, I understand you've got a couple of kids and this is what  you've got to do.  Oh, this is great.  Oh, yeah.  It's not a minivan unless you turn around and look.  Through the windshield, it's just another vehicle.  Right.  I can be in a Ferrari.  It's only a minivan when I hear the kids screaming and they're throwing crayons at the back of  my head.  He took me and my brothers on a tour of his brand new minivan.  There you go.  Showing all the features.  And I'm like, who are you kidding?  It's a minivan.  There are vehicles you shouldn't take your friends on a little tour of unless you just 
[01:00:00]  bought a goddamn Ferrari.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  You ever see somebody buys a Saturn or something?  I mean, it's all nice and well and everything, but just wait until they go, hey, nice car.  Dude, you've got to come out and see my new car.  The Saturn.  You want to see my Pinto?  I've got a family truck store out there.  It's great.  Taking the whole kids to Wally World.  Taking all of them to Wally World.  Let's go to Drippy.  Drippy, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How you doing?  Good. 
[01:00:30]  Hey, let John know that as soon as he buys that minivan and he pulls out of the dealership,  he's going to see a huge sign that says, you are now leaving Coolville.  Coolville.  You're never to return again.  Is that next to Whoville?  Coolville.  It's a one-way trip out of Coolville, I tell you.  All right.  Thanks, Drippy.  Kevin, what's going on?  Hey, O&A.  Hey.  What's up?  Hey, I used to have a minivan for 12 years when I first got married. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah?  I used to get something.  We got divorced.  That thing became a whorehouse on wheels.  I used to, I had a VCR and a thing.  We used to play porno tapes, portable cake parties.  You are not the rule, though, my friend.  But see, now I'm married again, no more minivan.  Don't need it anymore.  All right.  And you put the word mini in front of it, and it becomes geeky.  But in the older days, Opie, having the van was like the coolest thing ever.  You had to have a guy in your crew that you used to hang with in school, and he had to 
[01:01:30]  have the big 40-conoline van with the bubble window on the back, and the Kragers, and the  shag carpet, the bed.  Remember the bed?  You'd open up the back.  It's like, dude, you've got a bed back here.  Have the big lanterns on the paneling on the side of the van.  What about the artwork on the side of the van?  Or you had to have the airbrushed big gladiator guy with the hatchet or the wolf howling at  the moon.  That was a pool time machine.  That's right.  But now we've got the minivans. 
[01:02:00]  Wow, look how serious he was.  Look who's here, man.  Henry Rollins.  Henry, what's up?  We met a while back.  Yeah.  I remember up in my Boston.  Opie was sick that day.  I think my whole radio career was about a month old, and you came in.  Yeah, I remember that was the afternoon, and we played a couple of songs off my new record.  Yeah.  Wow, look at that.  You've got a good memory for that.  It was a while back.  Why are you so mellow?  I'm pretty intimidated.  Why are you mellow?  Why am I mellow?  Yeah, you're making us nervous, because we're, like, really hyper right now.  Well, yeah, but you're talking like a bunch of chicks. 
[01:02:30]  Chicks?  That's what we do.  We cackle all day.  There you go.  And I'm just trying to be the calm before the storm.  You don't have any...  But you talk when you do your spoken word.  You get up on stage and talk.  Yeah, but I'm getting paid.  Well, we are, too.  We get paid to talk about minivans and stuff.  Pretty lousy.  So I'm just kind of hanging out.  We're talking about parenting.  That's kind of cool, right?  Are you guys, are either of you...  F no.  F no.  No.  Someday.  Are you looking to be a dad someday? 
[01:03:00]  Someday, yeah.  And what are you going to do with that little truck that I spawned you?  I don't know.  Are you going to drive it to the soccer game to be used as a ball in one of those soccer  parent vehicles?  The van with the rounded edges?  That would be the minivan.  The minivan.  Say goodbye to your balls.  It's very clear.  That's it.  You grow up.  You're proud of your vehicles, having fun, hanging with the guys.  And then once you get married and have kids, you cash it all in.  Your wife tells you what to do.  And then you can't even watch what you want anymore. 
[01:03:30]  And then they try to pawn it off on everybody that didn't have kids.  What do you think about that?  Taking away entertainment.  People trying to get out there and take away sex and whatever.  Violence on TV.  It is an easy solution to all that.  Instead of getting married, you just go to your local strip mall, get some roofies and  some duct tape, get a few new recruits, throw them in the trunk of your minivan, and you  take them back to the waiting kennels in the compound that is your house. 
[01:04:00]  Every once in a while, you scrape them down, hose them down, feed them lean beef, and you  let them out, and you raise them right.  I have to go with that.  And then you have a harem that does what they're told.  I got this from Jerry Lee Lewis.  This is not anything I came up with.  That was a practice of Jerry Lee Lewis?  Well, he said you get them young.  Get them young and train them right.  Well, he did that.  That's exactly what he did.  Tony, what's up? 
[01:04:30]  What's up, O&A?  What's up, Mr. Rollins?  Big fan.  Oh, thanks.  Dude, man, you got the biggest set of grapefruits going, so there'll be a difference between  Joe Schmoe's kid and your kid because he has a cooler dad.  You know what I'm saying?  You could maybe pull off the minivan.  I can't.  Dude, I've seen my brother cry twice in his life.  When I bought my SUV and the day he bought his minivan.  It is pretty sad.  Dude, your sack goes south, bro, with a minivan.  Yeah, Darwin, if he was alive, he'd cry if he saw a minivan. 
[01:05:00]  It just means you gave up.  Yeah.  Dude, Rollins, man, never change, man.  You're the man.  Thanks.  Play the O&A.  He fit three mans in there.  Rollins, man, never change, man.  You're the man.  You must be the man then.  Taking the new CD, Henry.  Oh, thanks.  Henry Rollins.  Spoken word, doing the spoken word thing.  Yeah, I'm doing that till about June, and then I get back in the music thing.  Right.  I was reading your bio, and this is some F-dub facts about you.  13-hour practices with the band? 
[01:05:30]  Well, I don't know.  That's a long time.  It's on and off.  Isn't that just hanging out?  Some of it is, yeah.  At the point, 13 hours?  We would do, you know, six days a week, get in there in the morning and leave by dinner time sometimes.  And sometimes, when recording, you get into 17-hour days, whatever it takes.  Yeah.  Yeah, but, you know, you've got to get it happening.  Right.  All right.  Why don't we take a break, and we'll get into Henry Rollins and what he's up to, okay?  Cool.  All right.  Uh, 2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone number. 
[01:06:00]  Dudes with Tudes.  All right, we're hanging with Henry Rollins.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  He told us he hasn't slept.  Yeah.  This is yesterday's show at Town Hall, which was a huge success.  Yeah, it was a fun show.  Doing the spoken word thing.  You've got a new CD out called A Rollins and the Rye.  And we were listening in the back office.  Some good stuff on there.  Oh, thanks, man.  A lot of people want to say it's a comedy album, but I think it's more than that.  Yeah, it's got a lot of funny stuff. 
[01:06:30]  It's the way we edit the material.  We've put in, took two nights of a show, two different shows, and just took all the funny  stuff and made one CD in 65 minutes or whatever it is.  Bam, it's funny, and you're done.  Never really did that before.  So it's kind of cool like that.  Yeah, you've got some good observations on Clinton.  Clinton, these things.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, interesting guy.  Never met him, huh?  No, I don't hang out with many of the rich and things.  You know, there's really no politician I'd ever really want to meet.  Politicians never really did it for me. 
[01:07:00]  What about the body in Minnesota?  No, I don't want to meet some ex-wrestler.  I wouldn't mind meeting, like, you know, some African leaders or some, you know,  Kofi Annan from the U.N. or something.  That might be cool, but no American politician.  They're probably exactly the same.  You know, they're probably all the same old politics.  Well, I just think that in different countries, when they're dealing with a lot more life in  debt, that'd be an interesting guy to meet who's dealing with, like, you know, what's  going on in Rwanda or something.  What's your problem with American politicians in general? 
[01:07:30]  That they're full of it, and they're just basically self-promoting and not always looking  to do the job, which is to better the country.  That's the job.  It's a really dirty job, and they shouldn't be having such a grand old time.  I mean, they should be looking like Lincoln toward the end of his administration when  they're done, because that's what this country needs, to be able to really whoop some ass.  What do you see, like, wrong with the country?  Well, semi-literacy, homophobia, racism, 2% of the country. 
[01:08:00]  You're talking about the country or this show?  Wait a minute.  No, no, no.  What do you say?  I'm talking about the country.  No, I know you guys are open and cool, but you know what I mean?  There's just the same grinding problems year after year, and it's really boring.  After a while, you're like, it's 2001.  It's time for the Klan to be over with.  It's time to make Johnny learn how to read.  It's time to, like, evolve and get with it.  But is that what you think a country can do that, like a politician can help that out,  or isn't this just the way people are?  It's just the animals that we are, and some can be. 
[01:08:30]  No, man, it's the way Americans are.  You think so?  Yeah, I go all over the world, man.  There's other countries where people are way more on the ball in general.  I think any country you go to, there's going to be a group of people that hate another group  of people and want to kill them.  Sure.  And I don't think there's any politics or anything that's going to stop that, you know?  No, but I think you can culture young people and give them enough intelligence  where they can make a rational choice and go, well, the Klan's not for me.  It's too stupid.  Homophobia is too corny a concept to get into.  Hating that guy for his skin color or being afraid of that guy because of his skin color 
[01:09:00]  or religious affiliation is not a weak spot I'm going to go into.  And maybe that's the kind of sentiment you can impart to young people with better teaching,  better learning environments.  I'm not trying to sound like some guy in a soapbox.  I'm just saying things could be better.  It should be.  We live in a really great country.  I don't know how much you ever travel, but if you go to any third world hangout,  I try not to.  We're rocking.  We really got it going.  Oh, yeah.  And I don't think, if you could hang out in Calcutta or parts of Africa, 
[01:09:30]  these places I've been, you come back here and you're like, man, we're laughing.  We got it happening here.  And it's something to be protected, you know?  Yeah.  I see this kind of like we've come pretty far.  I think a lot of the problems you bring up, it's not as widespread as it was.  No, but you still got work to do.  Unless we're Vulcans, I don't think we're going to.  Kids are blowing each other away at school.  Yeah.  Got work to do.  16-year-old kids shouldn't be shooting kids. 
[01:10:00]  Hey, all right.  Who do you blame that on?  Well, blame, I don't know.  Well, I mean, but the media wants to, like, you know, point to blame.  Yeah, but the media always wants to point to blame because the media always sees themselves as judge and jury.  The guy who has the hardball show isn't judge or jury.  He's a talking head and he should just shut his mouth with his corny theories.  All those guys should, you know, it's just supposition.  Bravo.  But I'm saying Henry Rounds, what do you think is causing these school shootings?  All I know is when I was that age, I was very easily riled, but I never thought of shooting anybody, 
[01:10:30]  nor did I have access to guns, nor was I buying records that was telling me to shoot guys and slap women and all that.  So I'm not into censorship.  I'm just saying maybe young people have got a different slant on the value of life from the media they're getting.  You know, they're seeing a lot of stuff blow up, a lot of gratuitous sex shots, and access to guns.  I mean, all these guns that have been killing all these kids are belonging to parents, not kids. 
[01:11:00]  And so I think there's got to be, something's got to change.  I don't have any solid solution.  That's a bitch of a problem.  And there's no switch, you turn, and fix it.  I think it's just basically a general awareness and everyone realizing that American kids got a lot of questions  and they're not getting the answers.  And, you know, what kid doesn't have a million questions?  That's why I like, you know, shows like Loveline, kid can call in and figure out what's wrong, you know, with his parts, you know, 
[01:11:30]  and go, okay, I need help.  I need a number to call because I can't talk to my mom.  Some people would say a show like that is bad, you know.  You're hearing stuff, oh, it's sexually explicit.  My God, it's going to turn them into a waitress.  Sexually informational is what it is, and you can't ever be afraid of good information.  A lot of people don't see the difference.  It's true, but, you know, if you sell young people on this information, you always pay, like we're paying now.  I don't know, a lot of the guys I grew up with and a lot of people I grew up with and went to school with,  we really didn't have shows like that, but you figured it out yourself, and you didn't go around, like, you said, shooting people. 
[01:12:00]  Also, you didn't have a disease that could kill you either.  You got a shot and you were good.  Hey, remember the herp, though?  Well, you feared pregnancy.  You didn't, you know, getting your girl pregnant, you didn't fear getting killed by, you know, a good time.  Yeah, but, you know, because AIDS wasn't around then, you didn't think about it, obviously, because it wasn't around,  but you did have herpes, things that didn't go away.  Yeah, it didn't kill you because you sure as hell didn't want to get it. 
[01:12:30]  You had a war, you know, yeah.  We don't have to worry about that.  Well, it's going off to be a job for now.  Well, in general, it's not a week.  Wait until George W. goes abroad and starts calling, yes, your Arafat buddy and stuff like that.  Bomb our own people.  What the hell happened?  We just friggin' dropped a couple of bombs on our own guy.  Yeah, well, apparently that happens a lot.  And there's apparently some alarming statistic of Americans killing Americans in peacetime,  just, you know, Apache helicopters, like, hitting each other and stuff, really corny stuff. 
[01:13:00]  Like, you know, hangers blowing up because of a gas leak with everyone inside.  I just, you know, the wrong thing to have happen.  Right.  This guy wants in bad.  Tom, what's going on?  Oh, big fan of Henry Rollins, O&A.  I'm a big fan of you guys.  But, Henry, ten years ago I moved out here, and I ended up in a men's shelter out in Jersey.  And I graduated from that to a basement that had human sewage coming up from the hole in the floor or whatever. 
[01:13:30]  And all I had...  Some of them were in the Schrager Hotels.  Yeah.  All I had, I had a couple of tapes, and one of the things I had was a spoken word performance of yours.  And I just listened to it over and over, and you helped put things into perspective for me.  Oh, thank you.  And, you know, I really, I mean, I guess I'm saying thank you because, you know, I'm a totally different, you know, I'm an upstanding member of society.  I pay my taxes, yada, yada, yada.  And you're out of the basement.  Oh, I'm out of the basement, and the human waste goes where it belongs. 
[01:14:00]  There you go, right to the Republican Party.  Good man.  Also, just real quick, I saw you at the first Lollapalooza out in California.  And one of the biggest thrills was on the picture on the back when you're just, you got, like, this really intense look on your face.  And you could see my face in the crowd.  I just, I mean, I was just, just, you're awe-inspiring, just your intensity, and, dude, you're as American as apple pie, man. 
[01:14:30]  Thanks, man.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  He just smiled for the first time.  He's got an intense look on his face right now.  He finally smiled, don't wait.  All right, Tom, thank you.  All right, thanks.  All right, let's go to John.  John, what's going on?  Hey, man, how you doing?  Rollins, I want to let you know, back in 1993, I was going to Syracuse University,  broke up with my girlfriend, pretty cumulatious relationship.  The night that I broke up with her, I went to see you do a spoken word thing at Syracuse.  And you, exactly, I mean, you put everything in perspective for me. 
[01:15:00]  You were talking about the murder of a friend of yours.  And, I mean, you were very funny most of the time, but then you just blew my mind with that,  and it really got me through, and I just wanted to say thanks, man.  Oh, right on.  Thank you.  Have you ever been thinking of starting a cult, Henry?  Yeah.  You could probably whip one together pretty easy.  No, I just, I'm just an old American folk hero at this point.  Marissa.  Hi.  Hey.  What's up?  How are you guys?  We're talking to Henry Rollins.  What do you got?  Hi.  I was just talking before about his book, maybe like two or three weeks ago, Get In The Band. 
[01:15:30]  My boyfriend read it, and it really, it inspired him so much.  He's in a band, GFY, it's a hardcore band, and we document everything.  We go to Massachusetts to see our friends and play in band, and he plays in his band.  And we just document everything.  He writes now, ever since he read that book during Christmas, and it just really inspired him.  I just feel like I'm saying everything these other guys said.  Well, do you have a question for him, Marissa?  No, I just wanted to say that it's an amazing book.  I think everyone should read it.  I got to look at it, and it's just some of the stuff that you talk about in that book, 
[01:16:00]  about going on tour and what it's like.  It's just really down to earth and gritty and everything.  It was written on the road, so it's right from the field.  Yeah, no, that's what he does.  We put together a tape of all his shows, and he writes and everything.  Cool, thanks.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You do come across as like a guy that's always very thinking.  What do you do for mindless fun?  I'm a loser who lives alone, so that leads to a lot of introspection. 
[01:16:30]  I know you know what I'm talking about.  No, what do you do for mindless fun?  I mean, you've got to have an hour.  What, when I'm home, and there's nothing going?  Yeah, when I'm home.  Really listen to music.  You know, hang out, watch the birds in the trees in the backyard.  See, because you seem pretty intense most of the time.  Do you ever just let loose?  I'm on a schedule.  Like what?  Go get like nine Jägermeisters in me and fall overs?  That, or just sit in front of a lousy movie? 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, yeah, sure.  You know, when I'm home, I try and watch...  Mindless fun, you know what I'm saying?  I do a film at night.  You know, a lot of weird videos accumulate while I'm gone until I come back and check them out.  So, yeah, sure, I like to watch movies at the house or, you know, get a good workout in  or just listen to music without having to shut the phone off.  Just listen to like five LPs in one night and really listen to them and get into it.  What was the last album you listened to?  The last album?  Or CD, whatever, that you got into. 
[01:17:30]  The CDs, okay, the last CD I really got into was right before I left on this tour,  and that was by a guy who was in that band, Dinosaur Jr., Jay Mascus.  And it's his album, Jay Mascus and the Fog.  It's called More Light.  And he's just a great guitar player, a great songwriter, and it's like the best thing he's done in years.  And he always has a good record, but this is like an exceptional record.  Why is it so good?  Just great songs.  And he's just got a good thing.  The songwriting?  Yeah, he's just a good...  He's just one of my favorites.  I buy his stuff as soon as it comes out, and this is just a great...  Another great installment in, you know, like ten really good records by one guy. 
[01:18:00]  So, right.  You were talking about that.  I'm a fan.  You were talking about Napster before.  What do you think on that?  What are your feelings on that whole thing?  Well, if you're in my business, if you're a musician guy, you're used to people ripping you off.  You know, if it's not your slave owner, record company guy, it's a promoter, it's somebody.  But there's always somebody up your tailpipe moving around.  And so the Napster guy, you know, you get to get artist music for free. 
[01:18:30]  Well, he's just the new boss.  One day, you know, you're all bent over, and you look over, it's the Napster guy pummeling you.  So you're like, hey, go easy on me.  That's a take I haven't heard yet.  You know, so to me, it's just like, yep, here's the new guy screwing me.  You know, people go, yeah, man, I love your talking record.  I go, uh-huh, yeah, man, I downloaded it off Napster.  I'm like, wow, thanks a lot.  But, you know, if it gets them checking me out, cool.  Quite honestly, I really don't care that much either way. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  But do you Napster yourself?  No.  No?  We asked Aerosmith, and Joe Perry admitted, yeah, I download all the time.  But they weren't big fans of the whole thing either.  Yeah, they stated they're not big fans, but they have downloaded it.  I really don't think at the end of the day, anyone's going to go broke.  Anyone else is going to go broke as a Napster.  And if it brings people to music, that's kind of the idea about music anyway.  I'd rather be heard than paid.  You know, I'd rather, like, I'd rather 3 million people hear the record than, like, half a million people buy it. 
[01:19:30]  If, like, 100 people, 1,000 people buy it, great.  But if, like, 6 million people just hear it, greater.  Isn't that a tough...  At the end of the day, you just want people to check you out, you know?  Isn't that a good definition of an artist?  Well, yeah, that should be the definition of the artist.  That's why the whole commercial art thing, that's a weird line to tread.  Like, I need to get paid, guy.  I need food, you know?  I need to do all that stuff.  So when you are constantly releasing artistic work and putting a price tag on it,  it's just a weird gig when your art turns into commerce. 
[01:20:00]  And as a commercial artist, that's just your reality all the time.  So you see your baby with a price tag on it, and someone goes, this is a dollar too much.  It just sounds like blasting.  You're like, oh, my God, I'm so sorry.  It's just weird.  Or it's really weird to get, like, every once in a while you do some gig or something,  you get grossly overpaid for, like, some menial bit of work, like a voiceover.  All of a sudden, they're just handing you this tremendous wedge of cash.  And you're like, okay.  Man, this is, like, was nine months of my early, you know, my first ever job. 
[01:20:30]  And you're like, okay.  Well, that's cool.  It's just, it's a weird, it's a weird set of balls to keep up in the air, you know?  Yeah.  Do you do things for charity and stuff like that?  All the time, yeah?  Like, the CDs I put out from my own company, a dollar from each CD goes to a different cause.  Like, we did, Bandit Alive album this summer, came out a few months ago.  A dollar from each CD goes to the Southern Poverty Law Center, who battles the Klan in the South.  And the new Talking CD, which just came out on the Internet and at the shows, 
[01:21:00]  a dollar from each of those CDs go to the Hollygrove Orphanage, a cool little orphanage in L.A.  You know, it helps out kids.  So I'm just trying to, you know, start little fires here and there.  Just work out and go down and start kicking some Klan ass yourself.  Well, you know, pop up.  I have some ideas, you know, to deal with a Klan.  I've been coming up with some.  Anything you want to share?  Well, yeah, sure.  I mean, you can't leave a tag with that.  That's ominous.  Yeah.  Well, no, no, no. 
[01:21:30]  I don't think nailing him in the head with a baseball bat is any better than being in the Klan, you know.  So my concept was if I can get about $7 million and get Hilfiger and Versace and all these guys  to design some really hot, racy Klan outfits, I would organize a Klan chaos team,  which would be about 5,000 people strong.  And unfortunately, to be in this team, you must be gay.  But you get to be either black or Jewish.  And embodying three different food groups the Klan hates and fears, blacks, Jews, and gays. 
[01:22:00]  And they would come to any Klan rally in pink, wild-looking Klan outfits on pogo sticks, hoppity-hops, or figures.  All right.  That's one way.  So boinging into the parade as soon as the CNN cameras are there, everyone whips their hoods off,  starts deep soul-kissing, and the CNN cameras hit the crowd with it and see all the men making out  and getting down on mailboxes and, you know, the soundbite as well.  The Klan came to town, and the Klan, you know, went into their typical Klan activity. 
[01:22:30]  There was pogo sticks.  There was kissing in the street.  There was man love, and that's what the Klan stands for.  And so when the Klan would go back down south to their homes, they'd go back to the barbershop to hang out,  and everyone would be like, we saw you up there kissing that man.  Get out of our town, and no one would want them anymore.  And we'd have fun, and the Klan would be so innervated by being such corny, white-powered morons.  They would just have to stop.  No blood gets shed.  We'd get some cool outfits going. 
[01:23:00]  People got to take home some pogo sticks, always a premium.  And, you know, if I was president, this is how we'd be kicking it.  Interesting.  Yeah.  Britney Spears would be mowing people's lawns, and John Tesh would be running for dear life.  You don't like the Britney?  He would be in prison.  Well, I agree with you.  And Yanni would be swinging from a yard arm.  I might send him to Luxembourg.  Yeah.  You know, cool stuff like that. 
[01:23:30]  It would be interesting.  Shaheed.  Hey, how you doing?  How's up?  What's up, buddy?  Hey, Rollins, how you doing, man?  Good to hear you, man.  Good to hear you, man.  Good to hear you.  Anthony, what's up, man?  What's happening?  You really don't think that racism is as prevalent as it was back in the days, man?  Not as much as it was.  I mean, it's certainly not like the 60s.  It gets brought out in the open a lot.  I think it's more subtle and deep-seated, therefore more dangerous.  There you go.  There you go.  Well, I mean, when you have a black man, when you have any black man getting hung down south 
[01:24:00]  in the year 1999, you've got a real problem, man.  When you've got a black man getting dragged by a truck in Texas just about two or three  years ago, that's heavy, man.  The sensational events, I don't think, are as prevalent as they were years ago.  But here's what's worse, is just the inherent racism in the American tapestry that's so  deeply sewn in.  People are kicking a racist vibe, and they don't even know it. 
[01:24:30]  Right.  You see black comedy stereotyped on TV, and you're seeing the shuck and jive thing.  Well, you know what?  I don't want to excuse black people either, because you've got a lot of blacks that are  stereotyped.  A lot of blacks are responsible for keeping that going.  Sure.  If you put on Showtime at the Apollo or...  D.E.T.  Yeah, and you watch a lot of black comics, I mean, that's pretty much it.  Yeah, but you know what?  Nobody dies as a direct result of that. 
[01:25:00]  You know, we still have a lot of racist organizations out there that are straight up just killing  black people.  Yeah.  You know, we have a girl that was down in Florida, a six-year-old girl got shot in the  head, man.  And also...  Just because, you know, I was living with, you know, a black girl.  And you have a thing like, you know, the Nation of Islam, Fruit of Islam, who is, you know,  gets to be reactionary against this stuff, so that message comes out kind of veiled and  strange, like...  Right.  You know, and so it's just more things to untangle, so you get this more kind of a nebulous web 
[01:25:30]  where people got to start talking to one another and getting down to a ground zero plan, and  kind of everyone has to come out.  Like, Chuck Deese, as always, says it best.  He says that...  Some guy said, why are you so black?  He goes, I'll stop being so black when you guys stop being so white.  Well, you know, I couldn't have said it better.  Well, he goes, I'll back off a little when you back off a little, and maybe there's a little  airspace we can meet at and talk like human beings.  And I...  That, like always, that guy speaks volumes to me.  He's one of my heroes.  But, I mean, is that realistic, though? 
[01:26:00]  Hell yes, it is.  Well, we got...  Very realistic.  We got to meet in the middle of something.  If you want...  Somehow.  If you want change, you'll have it.  It's just that a lot of people...  But if you're not going to budge and I'm not going to budge, how are you ever going to  get anything done?  Well, some...  I think people should question why they're not budging.  Yeah.  And it's a tough call to make people forgive and budge.  I mean, I grew up in Washington, D.C. through the 60s and 70s.  To be white was to run from black kids.  That's all there is to be.  And I'm not racist.  I just got mugged all the time. 
[01:26:30]  Well, you know something?  I grew up in the suburbs.  I'm up in Rockland County.  And for me to be black and date a white girl...  You know how many times I've been pulled over by the police, man?  And they'd yank the girl out the car and ask her if I was abducting her?  Of course.  If I was raping her?  If she was there willing?  I mean, you know...  That would get you killed in the wrong place.  Of course.  Well, you know what?  Let me just say one quick thing, man, to Opie and Anthony.  Look, I call these guys every now and then.  You know, I yell at them, use the pseudonym every now and then.  But let me tell you something, Rylans.  You're on a good show, man.  Thanks, man.  You and two guys, man, I think it's going to blow up. 
[01:27:00]  You know?  So keep it moving, man, and keep it going, all right?  All right, man.  All right, take care, yo.  There he goes.  Shaheed.  John, what's up?  John?  Yeah, what's up, man?  We only have a few minutes left with Henry Rylans.  All right.  I just wanted to ask him if he's going to be in the area anytime soon,  besides that event he was just doing, doing any spoken words.  The New York area?  Yeah.  No.  Like New York, New Jersey.  No, I'm sorry, man.  There's more shows I want to do out here.  I've got to get to them later in the year.  I'm going straight west.  Straight west day after tomorrow. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, man.  That really sucks.  But with the whole racist thing that was just coming up,  like, I don't think anybody's going to budge.  I think some people are just so set in their ways.  Even if you question them, they can't give you the answer  because they're just ignorant.  Thankfully, there's young people,  and the old folks die off when the new ideas come in.  Yeah, hopefully that happens.  We don't burn witches anymore.  Why?  Enough cooler heads prevailed eventually.  This is true.  And so there's...  Now we've got witches all over the place.  Yeah, Wiccan all over. 
[01:28:00]  Well, but, you know, then there's guys like you  who would never go that way, right?  No.  Well, there you go.  See, it's like that.  It's not that I wouldn't go that way.  I know a couple of Wiccans,  but that doesn't mean I stereotype against them  because of what they believe.  No, no, no.  I'm talking about the racism.  Yeah, I know.  Thanks, man.  Change comes subtly and slowly,  but you've got to work towards it.  Where do we begin?  By just realizing you don't really have any enemies around here,  and it's time to get off that  and stop listening to fear media,  stop plugging into fear TV.  Like, you've ever seen those cop shows? 
[01:28:30]  Man, those are edited in such a way.  Some of those are pretty dodgy.  And, like, they show the liquor store hold-up video footage,  and they'll show it four times in one show.  I love that show.  Yeah, but it's like that inflicts fear into white suburbs.  When the going gets rough, the scared get conservative,  and that's why, you know,  the whitey just puts up the castles and arms the doors.  Do you think they honestly pick black guys  on the surveillance cameras to put on the shows?  Or is that most of the surveillance tape that they get? 
[01:29:00]  Or, there's a great guy.  His name is Hamill.  He has a one-man band called Hamill on trial,  and he wrote a great song.  He goes, watched a thing on TV last night.  Black guy robbed a grocery store.  And he said, in my town, this girl shot this guy over crack,  and this guy abducted this girl and killed her,  and they were all white.  And then he goes verse after verse of all these crimes,  and they were all white.  You know, it happens on both sides.  I think those shows can be edited in such a way,  it's one of my conspiracy theories, 
[01:29:30]  that there's such a thing called fear TV.  Because when you have a lot of fear,  you can make a lot of money off someone who's scared.  You can sell them on Mark Furman.  You can sell them on, you know, weapons they don't need.  You can just sell them on just a whole fear lifestyle,  which means divide, separate, stereotype.  I don't see the good part of it.  He's on to us.  B-3, plan B-3.  Part of the conspiracy.  Yeah, yeah.  Security, security.  I'm scared of a guy with puka beads. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, great.  Those aren't pukas.  This is, I like this.  It's from Abercrombie.  No, it's really nice.  Abercrombie.  Because you got me shaking like a leaf.  I didn't say that, I was saying that.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  How's it going, Henry?  All right.  Listen, I just wanted to share with you  a little off the racism subject,  and everything.  Yes, please take us off that subject.  When you wrote the books,  Now Watch Him Die,  at that time when that book came out, 
[01:30:30]  I had just lost a very close friend of mine  to murder as well.  And reading your book,  it was like looking at your words on paper  was exactly what was going on in my head,  and I didn't know how to say what I felt.  And the book did you some good then?  Yeah, it really, really helped me out a lot.  And you personally have had a lot to do  with changing my life.  I was very into drugs and alcohol  and just being generally a bad person.  And since being introduced to you 
[01:31:00]  musically and spoken word in your books,  I've been able to give up drugs and drinking.  Sounds like you're talking about Jesus.  Yeah, no, the spoken word, the books.  I'm glad you got off the toxin, man,  because you know how it kills people.  Absolutely, absolutely.  You're not supposed to be out poisoning yourself,  and I was,  and you sort of inspired me to change all that.  Thank you very much.  That's good.  Thanks.  All right, man.  All right, Rob.  Well, we've got to get you out of here, Henry. 
[01:31:30]  So you can sleep.  Yeah, one of these days.  On my way up to beautiful Toronto tonight,  I'll get some sleep.  Oh, no.  That's a nice city.  It'll just be me and all the Thai hookers on that.  What's your favorite place in the entire world?  Because you do a lot of traveling.  My favorite country to be in?  Or America.  Or, no, just place.  Oh, just, well, I'll give you like 10 places I love.  I love being in Sydney, Australia.  I love being in Tokyo, Japan.  I love being in Hamburg, Germany.  I love being in Paris, France, London, England. 
[01:32:00]  New York City, America.  I'm sure there's others.  Calcutta, India.  I've got one of those places.  Just, yeah, I've got to get out.  He's got some good stuff on Israel.  Israel's a fascinating place, man.  You've got to go, man.  You make the comparison between Israel and America.  Can it, like, just really fast?  Well, yeah.  Two intense war-like cultures, except in Israel, it is on the line all the time.  Because the border skirmish is right over there, not on a distant CNN image. 
[01:32:30]  It's, like, down the road.  And when you're walking around seeing hot-looking chicks dressed up in Castro outfits with that huge gun with a banana clip,  it makes one pause.  Because, A, you want her to let her hair down, but, B, I don't want her to shoot you.  It's really intense.  It's just a different vibe over there, like a doctor walking to work with a machine gun.  Yeah.  And that's just like a watchdog on his shoulder.  It's just different.  Also, you say, you know, you can visit places where Jesus walked. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, and in America, we have nothing like that.  Well, you see where the Hooters used to be before the wind knocked it down because there's only one brick thick.  Well, you get to see where Jimi Hendrix stood 35 years ago, and that's cool.  But when someone says, Jesus walked around this corner with that cross, it's kind of like, that's pretty cool.  Because it's a tight right.  It's right around the way Veronica tells them off.  And you're trying to fit the piano around the corner.  How did he do it? 
[01:33:30]  He must have had it together, that little vegan body dress.  That big old cross up the hill.  Makes you like him even more.  It puts it in perspective, doesn't it?  Yeah, or when you go to, you know, Giza and you see the pyramids and the sinks, it looks good in a picture.  When you're standing in front of it, you start thinking, well, yeah, extraterrestrials did build this because man can't do this.  Because you can't even climb up one of the blocks of the pyramid.  It's like that cool.  Yeah.  And that's why you've got to get out and see this stuff before you drop so your head gets expanded so you stop falling for a lot of the corny stuff people throw at you around here. 
[01:34:00]  Well, we've got stuff like that.  No, you guys got it all.  Right here in this room with you two, your dynamic intellect.  The way you two tightens are radioed, the way you guys go at it.  It's so damn inspiring.  We have like the Empire State Building.  The Empire State Building.  Yeah, so.  All right, relax with my beads.  See, what we have here in this country is skyscrapers, which is this architect finally being so tired of being emasculated by their women, they build the biggest phallus they can.  They're like, see, baby, try and make this go down. 
[01:34:30]  Call this little, will you?  Yeah, all those big skyscraper building architects are just frustrated men who got told their thing is little.  This is pre-Viagra stress relief.  Let's get you out of here.  Henry, it's been a pleasure.  Right on, you guys.  Very interesting.  I could listen to you all day.  The new CD's called Rollins and the Rye.  It's spoken word, observations, comedy.  It's nice.  Thanks.  Liked it a lot.  I was listening on the train the last couple of days, so. 
[01:35:00]  Well, thanks.  I think we're even going to leave with a track called My Gay Neighbors.  Oh, yeah, that thing.  Hello?  Yeah, I thought I'd inject a little intelligence to this conversation here.  Yeah, there's no place on this show.  I know that.  Opie and Anthony.  More stupidity on the way.  1027 WNEW.  N-E-W.  All right, we're going to get the energy back up, Anthony.  That was cool, though.  You know, very intense man.  I'm not dissing Henry Rons. 
[01:35:30]  That was cool, but now we're going to get the energy back up.  I have to check out a picture here.  Brody, what's up?  Yo, dude, this is why I live in New York.  Okay?  Both of you guys, on both hands, much respect.  Intense.  That was freaking intense.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was pretty intense.  Got to say.  Man, just like two different spectrums, two different types of people, but, man, just  getting down on a forum and just kicking butt. 
[01:36:00]  And that's why I'm in New York.  That's why I love New York.  That's the only reason.  Forget all the...  Sorry.  That's all right.  Go ahead.  Forget all the other stuff that goes over on CNN and all that nonsense.  This is what I want to hear.  Real people...  Yeah.  ...point to you, and this shit...  It just rocks.  I'm sorry.  It just rocks.  All right, Brody.  All right.  So you enjoyed Henry Rollins?  No.  Have him on as often as possible.  I couldn't imagine having a, like, going through life like that. 
[01:36:30]  See, I thought...  Well, I thought I was a pretty serious guy and intense at times.  Please.  He takes it to a whole new level.  I think it's like, okay, what do you do for fun and stuff?  He smiled once.  Yeah.  What do you do for fun?  Sometimes hang out.  Listen to music and stuff.  But not tear it up at all, or...  But he's got some interesting stuff in that brain of his.  Some good observations.  I like observations. 
[01:37:00]  Trying to figure out ways to save the world.  I got games to play.  You know?  Robert, what's up?  Hey, I wonder if management bringing in Henry Rollins like that to straighten you guys out,  or are you still going to do the dildo chairs tomorrow?  Oh, please.  He didn't get to you guys, did he?  Huh?  He didn't get to you guys, did he?  Yeah, he's an interesting guy.  I'm only kidding you.  And I enjoyed listening to him.  I did, too.  In fact, I'm going to look for some of his stuff out there on Napster tonight. 
[01:37:30]  All right.  Thank you.  You guys be good.  All right.  No, musical dildo chairs tomorrow with John Valby.  It's happening.  Yes.  One lucky lady is walking away with a trip to WrestleMania in Houston, Texas.  It's going to be a great show tomorrow.  Less than 24 hours before the festivities start with musical chairs tomorrow.  All right?  Nice.  That's what we need.  Some smut.  Also, Anthony, we should announce the road show. 
[01:38:00]  A week from tonight.  Make your plans now.  We haven't done one in nine months.  Yeah.  We're back on the road, finally.  Here we go.  An O&A road show.  It's not going to be like the live taping for the XFL show.  That's for sure.  No, this is all about having fun and showing you a lot of the people that make this show so good.  And smut.  And smut.  Lots and lots of smut.  Yeah.  The road show is happening a week from tonight at the Vanderbilt in Plainview. 
[01:38:30]  Right.  In our backyard.  Long Island, baby.  Yes.  The retard Laverne Shirley will be there.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Pete Radovich from NBC putting together the bloopers from our XFL game day.  All the little outtakes, the things you didn't get to see.  Me cursing a lot.  Anthony's band performing.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  The guys are going to come up.  They're going to be like the Tonight Show Orchestra. 
[01:39:00]  I'm up there.  You know, when we introduce people, they'll have appropriate music and whatnot.  You're thinking war pigs for the tart of Laverne and Shirley?  They could play that.  Yeah.  It's going to be a lot of fun, so make sure you show up at the Vanderbilt in Plainview.  21 or older.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Yeah.  It's the way it is.  We did give you guys 21 and under, you know, some good stuff at the WWF Restaurant.  That was 18 and older, but we've got to go back to 21 and older for this one. 
[01:39:30]  No cover charge.  The Vanderbilt in Plainview.  We should have directions up on the websites.  We'll get that all up, you know, by tomorrow, I'm sure.  But it's going to be unbelievable because we haven't done one of these in a long time.  We're going to have a lot of the comedians, just everyone you know and love from the show.  Yeah.  As many as possible, anyway.  Cool.  All right.  Some of the girls from the Best Ass Contest will show up.  Yeah.  That's going to be great.  That's going to be great. 
[01:40:00]  Edison, what's going on?  Yeah, hello?  Hey, Edison.  Yeah, man.  What am I listening?  It's W-L-I-R-R over here with a Vanderbilt.  A Vanderbilt?  Whatever.  Is this L-I-R or any W?  It's out on Long Island.  Why?  It's just every time that usually I hear about that, it's L-I-R guys talking about,  oh, we got another 80s band coming back.  I think there's some, I'll tell you what it is.  I think some of the L-I-R guys are on the Vanderbilt.  Do we care?  No.  So who's going to, there's no admission?  Is that what you're saying?  No cover.  Right.  So you just show up?  Show up and drink and have fun, yes. 
[01:40:30]  You just walk right in?  Right.  Like a casino in Vegas?  Right.  Edison, we're a little bigger than W-L-I-R, so don't worry about it, okay?  All right.  I want to get there, man.  I hope it's going to be good.  All right.  All right, guys.  Bye.  Later.  But I believe there's some of the guys from L-I-R or whatever own the place.  Who cares?  Mm-hmm.  I don't care.  It's a great venue.  Right.  They want to have us, and that's where we're going.  And if they want to promote it on W-L-I-R, I could care less.  Feel free.  Feel free.  Scott, what's going on? 
[01:41:00]  Scott?  Yeah, yeah.  Let's go.  Hey, how are you going to work this thing?  Are they going to velcro these things to the sea?  Are they going to work it themselves, or what?  What do you think is going to happen tomorrow with the musical chair game?  Oh, it's going to go over good.  Huh?  I'm just wondering how you're going to work it.  Don't you worry about the logistics.  All righty.  I'm just making sure.  I want this to go right.  We're going to take care of it.  It's going to go right.  It's going to be a great bit tomorrow on the radio.  All right.  Later, guys.  All right, man. 
[01:41:30]  We should get Frank Caliendo in here.  He's been waiting outside.  What about the ass girls?  And the ass girls?  We can do a little of that.  John, what's going on?  Hey, man.  What's going on?  I called about the minivan.  I just wanted to check if you guys were all right.  Who is that?  George Carlin or Dennis Miller on steroids?  Holy cannoli.  Gee whiz.  Guy, come on.  Save the world on your own time.  He wasn't just talking about saving the world.  He was interesting.  No, you're absolutely right.  You're absolutely right.  Expand your mind, brother.  Absolutely right. 
[01:42:00]  But I was wondering if he has a tattoo of Mao Zedong like Mr. Mike Tyson does.  All right.  Very good, John.  Thank you.  Vinny the racist is pissed.  He's instant feedback.  And he's on the phone.  Yeah, I'm pissed.  Well, come on, Anthony.  You let this guy ran on.  This guy's talking nothing but garbage about his, uh, yeah, he's watching the video cameras  at those 7-Elevens and they're just putting the black guys on.  Yeah, I'm sure.  I can't believe you guys even let that skunk talk.  I asked him about that.  I said, do you think that's because they edit it? 
[01:42:30]  Wait, I asked him, do you think that's because they edit it or that most people talk?  You should have started laughing and said, what are you kidding me?  I mean, come on, Anthony.  This is ridiculous.  You let that.  I was never so pissed in my life when I heard this garbage going on.  Oh, Vinny, Vinny.  No, but I'm talking to you.  Vinny, Vinny.  This time, this is it, man.  Vinny, you sound a little intense.  Are you still pissed off that you bombed at the WWF restaurant?  Oh, okay.  Well, yeah, a little bit, yeah.  Okay.  At least you're being honest with yourself.  I mean, I really want you guys to put me on with this guy because I notice that this 
[01:43:00]  guy's put a lot of money towards the KKK, but I notice he's not putting any money towards  Farrakhan, Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, and all those racists.  Well, maybe not.  I hope that stum is listening to me talk right now in his cab or wherever the hell he is  because he's full of garbage, and I know all your fans out there cannot be believing  that piece of garbage.  All right.  If he's listening, he'll call back.  Wow, Vinny.  Yeah, I doubt it.  Vinny, Vinny's on a tear.  We like, but this is the, I was, I've never been so, I don't like to hear this garbage, 
[01:43:30]  and, you know, Vinny, Vinny, Vinny, Vinny.  I've got to, like, be a little nice to the guy, but come on.  No, no, no, no, Vinny, it made you react.  That's what our show's all about.  We let people, we let people talk on our show.  That's his opinion.  And Anthony confronted him on it.  Vinny, perhaps it is a conspiracy.  Oh, come on.  You're such a dick.  I love getting wound up.  It's hysterical.  I mean, I'm not kidding.  This is no joke, man.  I mean, you know, guys like that. 
[01:44:00]  Hold on.  Gary wants in on this.  Gary, yes.  Hey, Vinny.  Yeah.  Wash your mouth up a little bit.  This guy's good.  He's cynical.  Oh, shut up.  You're not kidding me.  He's good.  How come he's not putting any money towards Farrakhan?  What, only the whites are...  Who does put money towards Farrakhan?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, this guy was, I've heard this guy all day.  He spoke nothing but the truth from this morning at 8 o'clock all the way through to 522.  You're out of your mind, Vinny.  You shook your...  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, tough guy. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, I'm not...  Vinny.  Hey, no, no sweat going on, Vinny.  You're just acting like a moron.  Hold on.  You can't say that.  No cursing.  No cursing, Vinny.  Come on.  Be more funny.  Vinny, you can't curse, please.  You're killing us with the delay.  Vinny, strike two.  One more.  We've got to hang up because none of this is going on the radio when you curse.  Yeah, Vinny.  Well, you're not for me.  I'm here more.  I didn't...  Let me tell you something.  I didn't hear the whole speech that Scott gave.  It was in my car.  I caught the latest half hour. 
[01:45:00]  And when I heard, this guy was saying nothing but KKK mentioned him about 20 times.  Vinny, you should have been looking for the guy all day like I could get in the car.  Because I'm looking for the guy all day, and the guy makes sense.  He's passing me on a thing, a hoodie, saying about how fast it is.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on, Vinny.  Get it.  All right, hold on.  Let it...  Gary, hold on a minute.  Vinny, yes?  Yeah, I just asked a question.  I caught the last half hour of this guy talking. 
[01:45:30]  I don't even know if he's a white or black guy.  But all I know is I heard him say to KKK about 20 times.  I didn't hear him say Sharpton once, Jesse Jackson, Farrakhan.  I didn't hear any of them names.  Did he mention them?  No.  Vinny.  Oh, I wonder why.  You know why, yeah.  Because only the white guys are racist.  There ain't no black racists out there.  Blacks can't be racist because you need power.  And what's the other thing you need?  The ingredients? 
[01:46:00]  Intelligence.  Go ahead.  Throw it out there.  No, it isn't.  Like, there's some reason I've heard a lot of black people say black people cannot be racist.  No, they can't.  Because you need the power to be a racist, and they don't have that.  Yeah, only the white man can be the racist.  That's not true, Vinny.  I see it every single day.  Vinny, I enjoyed Henry Rollins.  I think everybody...  I don't have to agree with Henry Rollins, but it was interesting to get his take on things.  You know, I've got to be honest.  I caught the last 10th hour, and then I was trying to dial in as much as I could when I... 
[01:46:30]  Because what I heard...  I saw you on the phone, and I didn't realize you were going to go off.  I would have put you right in.  Gentlemen, I've got to say, have a good night.  We love a good confrontation.  All right, Gary.  Have a good night, gentlemen.  All right, Gary.  Good night, Gary.  Good night, Gary.  All right.  Vinny, can we...  Vinny.  Vinny's very, very riled up.  Vinny.  Did Vinny leave, too?  No, I'm here.  I just want to say...  All right, Vinny, listen.  Vinny, this is what I'm going to do for you, okay?  Yeah. 
[01:47:00]  Henry will definitely be back at our show.  Oh, good.  Oh.  Yeah, go ahead.  Not today, obviously, but, you know, he'll be around again, and he'll be on the show again,  and I promise you, you can confront him, okay?  Great.  No, I'm serious.  No, I think I will be...  You know why?  Because it's one thing, you know...  I didn't hear the whole...  I don't know how long it was.  You take this stuff pretty serious.  He takes it to the other end of the spectrum.  You do.  I mean, I, you know...  I mean, from what I heard, for the half hour I heard this guy talking, I mean, it just 
[01:47:30]  sounds like your typical...  Is he a white guy or a black guy?  He's a white guy.  Oh, man.  You've never seen Henry Rollins before?  No, no, I never heard of him before until today.  Oh, all right.  But, you know, not...  I mean, the guy might be a great comic or whatever he does, but, I mean, you know...  No, no, no.  He's not a comedian.  Oh, what is he?  Some of the things may make you laugh, but he's all about, you know...  It's called spoken word.  Observation, some laughs, you know, a little of everything. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, well...  All right, Vinny.  Vinny, next time he's on the show, you have our word, all right?  That would be nice.  Okay.  I love you guys.  There you go.  Vinny, I got something for you.  Be more funny.  You guys are bad.  All right.  Remember when 300 people were screaming that?  Come on, Opie, cut it out with that.  It was a long time ago.  It was a long time ago, huh?  It was funny, and you handled yourself very well, all right? 
[01:48:30]  Thanks a lot, fellas.  All right, Vinny.  Love you guys.  All right.  Later.  Anthony, moving on with the show, look who's in the studio, Frank Calderon.  Yes, Frank, how you doing?  Look what you got to follow.  What you just walked into.  All right, Frank, be funny.  I missed most of Henry Rolins because I was looking at the best ass pictures.  Yeah.  You know what that, right?  Yes.  Yes.  You should have seen Rick trying to take him.  That's always funny.  He would actually show, do a little more of this.  Move his ass around.  Oh, I know.  He does that.  It's disgusting.  He puts his hip out. 
[01:49:00]  He goes, you got to do this.  Now, turn around and give a pouty face.  Looky nice.  Yeah.  Isn't that terrible?  It was scary.  Frightening, right?  Well, we have some of my contestants, though, out there, man.  Okay.  All right, we'll bring him in.  Yeah.  God, the show's intense today, Frank.  I apologize.  Right off the bat.  That's right.  You walked into an S-storm.  Vinny and Henry in there is like a matter, anti-matter.  You know what I mean?  That would have been some great radio.  If I knew we were going to get that, I would have put Vinny right through.  Oh, yeah.  That would have been explosive. 
[01:49:30]  You know, what am I supposed to do?  Sit there and beat Vinny's mouth?  Oh, my God.  I don't think we have the same beliefs, Vinny.  Know what I'm talking about.  You know.  There were certain things I did disagree with, and I called him on it, asked him about it.  I don't believe in any nationwide conspiracy as far as convenience store security tapes go. 
[01:50:00]  Frank does.  You believe in the security?  It's a huge conspiracy.  He would tell me outside.  Yeah, it's a big conspiracy.  Interesting.  Put me on the spot now.  I do voices.  Come on.  What are you thinking?  I haven't put together some bits.  Am I a waste of energy?  I'm here trying not to look stupid.  And then you say there's a conspiracy.  Yeah, there's a conspiracy.  Al Pacino's looking at every single security camera on Earth.  I can't believe this guy is looking at me and talking like that. 
[01:50:30]  It doesn't make sense.  Vinny, I'm Italian.  Just like you're Italian.  We both know that there's no conspiracy.  We understand the game.  We understand how it's played.  And neither of us knows the rules.  We just make them up as we go along.  But the feeling here is that everything gets better as long as you ramble on.  It keeps going.  There's never going to be a joke.  Why would there be a joke?  This is Frank Kelly.  I know.  I don't do jokes. 
[01:51:00]  I do voices.  I look straight ahead.  It's kind of like I'm looking at somebody else.  You guys are missing the visuals.  I'm waiting.  If you guys could understand what I was talking about, I'm not looking at anything right now.  I'm doing that same damn thing I did instead of a woman and I've done ever since then.  Did he really?  Oh, yes, he did.  Al Pacino kicked.  There's a guy with a sign looking at me.  I wasn't looking.  I was looking at it straight ahead.  And I wasn't looking at the sign.  And in heat, I kicked Henry Rollins' ass. 
[01:51:30]  I kicked his ass big time.  So don't tell me I don't know about Henry Rollins.  Don't tell me I don't know about Tree Rollins.  I'm an old NBA guy.  I love the NBA.  It's a great thing.  The NBA.  Just be there.  Isn't that what it was?  Wait a second.  That's NBC.  For all those of you who watch your what's going on right now, neither am I.  I'm just sitting here.  I haven't even made Anthony laugh yet.  I hope he's on the ground.  Anthony's going, why do we get this guy?  He doesn't make sense.  It's Vinny still there.  Maybe Henry Rollins could put together some words that he's spoken. 
[01:52:00]  And maybe, maybe he could describe the idiocy that has been involved in this little place,  this little cubicle of media that is here since I walked in the room.  Sorry about the rants.  He's still going.  Bravo.  Jesus Christ, Frank Caliendo.  Are you playing anywhere, Frank?  Sure.  I'm playing at Bananas Comedy Club in Hasbro Heights, New Jersey, Friday and Saturday, 8 o'clock 
[01:52:30]  and 1045.  I almost said 1015.  That would have been wrong.  You killed on Conan after our show.  I think it was fun.  Killed.  Yeah.  It was so much fun.  Everyone called us the next day going, oh my God.  How is that?  It was scary.  It was interesting because I had to go on after Kevin Pollack, who has impressions as well.  And he's really good.  You know, because, let me say it, you are better than Kevin Pollack.  Come on.  I know, you're a fellow comedian, so you can't really, you know.  No, I signed a deal with him that says I can't say that.  But I'm telling you, I mean, you blow him away. 
[01:53:00]  Well, he was also doing this.  He's a talented guy.  But he was doing panel and stuff like that.  It's nice of you.  Oper.  Hey, Oper.  I'm going into like some bad Nathan.  Hey, Oper.  What was that?  That's like Uncle Arthur.  Uncle Arthur, yeah.  Like Nathan Lane is Uncle Arthur.  Hakuna Matata.  Don't worry, Samantha.  We showed up in the oven.  What was that?  Here's a guy who sometimes he does a voice and it doesn't make sense.  Whap.  Pow.  Hey.  John Madden time. 
[01:53:30]  When does this guy ever talk about something that makes sense?  You want to talk about asses, John Madden?  Hey, asses is a great part of the body.  As good as the breast.  And sometimes a neck can be good, but really I like to, I like to, I like to, I like, I'm an ass man.  Anthony's laughing.  Hey, when I started spanking some asses, whap, pow, smack.  Hey, that's going to, hey, hey. 
[01:54:00]  Jason, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Frank, you're hysterical.  Thanks, man.  You're not one of those guys who was driving up the road last time, huh?  No.  What was that?  Remember those guys?  I don't want to say this is wrong or something like that.  I don't want to sound as good as a song wrong at the beginning here.  But, uh, Frank, you're so funny you're making me drive off the road.  Stop.  We want to see, we want to see proof of those guys driving off the road.  We hear it all the time.  But, uh, I talked with my friend and, uh, he said he can't play his Madden 2001 game on PlayStation anymore 
[01:54:30]  because all he does is hear Madden say the same stupid thing go over and over again.  Hey, that guy looks like he got hit by a freight train.  That's the one thing that's been in every Madden game ever.  Whap.  Hey, that guy looks like he got hit by a freight train.  So true.  That's Stinky.  He plays the game every damn day.  Right, Stink?  Is that on or what?  Oh, you guys.  They're on it all the time.  It wouldn't have been fourth down if he didn't convert on third down. 
[01:55:00]  It wouldn't have been fourth down if he didn't convert on third ground.  It's even third ground.  Hey, see, that's a different kind of thing when you try to repeat what the guy just said.  Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, someday.  Apparently he likes that, too, I've been told.  He likes the impression?  Mm-hmm.  He likes the man.  That's very cool.  I don't, I, I, more I've been told he doesn't dislike it.  Mm-hmm.  So I don't know if he likes it.  He's got to be flattered. 
[01:55:30]  Who does John Madden?  Frank Caliendo at BananasCon.  Yes, Frank Caliendo at Bananas in Hasbrook Heights, Friday and Saturday.  Two shows, that's it, or two shows each night?  Two shows each night.  Okay, Friday and Saturday, two shows, 8 p.m. and 10.45 each night, okay?  Mm-hmm.  Quick break and we'll be back?  Super.  We're getting back into the laughs, finally.  And bring in some ass.  And you want to see some ass, Frank?  Oh, God.  I don't even have to look in the same direction.  Wait a second, that's a joke I already did five times.  Here's a guy who, if he practiced more, crap like this wouldn't happen. 
[01:56:00]  Opie.  I'm the dick.  Anthony.  Yeah, well, I'm an ass.  We have lots of asses around this place today.  Not talking about you, Frank.  Frank Caliendo in the studio.  He's playing Bananas, Hasbrook Heights, Friday and Saturday night.  We highly recommend you go see Frank Caliendo.  Is this true?  Florentine's opening up for you?  Yeah, I think, yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[01:56:30]  We love Florentine's.  He's on the phone.  Jim.  Yeah, what's up?  You're opening up for Frank?  Yeah, I'm opening up for you, Frank, this weekend.  That's going to be awesome.  I don't think we ever met before.  I hope our material doesn't clash, because I do a John Madden impression, too.  Here's a guy who's messing with me.  No, seriously.  I'm going to bring a trough on stage and eat from it.  Hey, here's a guy who has a little different material than I do, but at the same time, it's nothing like it.  I like John Madden, but he's always circling stuff, and especially food, too. 
[01:57:00]  Nothing wrong with circling stuff.  Yeah, well, you know, it's always burgers, fried chicken.  It's never anything healthy.  You want to be circling some guy jogging in the parking lot?  Circle some broccoli, or you've got some corn there, and this bit's going nowhere, Frank.  He's getting heavier, too, John.  Well, yeah.  When I see Madden on the screen, my TV gains 10 pounds. 
[01:57:30]  Good on the...  Made that goddamn rim shot.  All right, Jim.  So, yeah, all right.  So, yeah, I'll see you there this weekend, Evan.  That sounds great.  Thanks.  All right.  Don't let that last joke be an indicator of Jim Florentine, because he is actually funny,  unlike that last joke.  Sometimes the phone muffles what you're saying, and it sounds different than what it is.  It's very funny, and it's going to be a good show.  Bananas Hasbrook Heights, Friday and Saturday.  Two shows.  Do you want to, you know...  Can we give out that number for random reasons? 
[01:58:00]  That's what I was going to do.  I got distracted.  There's so many hot chicks out there.  Are we bringing them in?  Bring them in while I give out this phone number.  For reservations, 201-727-1090.  201-727-1090 for Bananas and Hasbrook Heights.  Bring on the asses.  Ladies, hello.  Wow, look at this.  Hello.  I forgot we were doing an ass contest.  See?  Look at all the girls.  Rick's been snapping pictures outside the studio for the last hour. 
[01:58:30]  Are we going to get new pictures up on WNAW.com?  Yep.  I just gave Scott another clip, so more pictures are going up.  Another clip.  And a couple of girls are having their pictures redone as well.  Because, quite frankly, the pictures we have up already are horrific.  Hi, ladies.  Who do we have here?  Hi.  Can we see your stuff?  Like your butt?  Can we see your stuff?  How many different variations of that do we have?  Turn around this way, then.  Hey, how are you talking?  Well, show Frank Caliendo your butt. 
[01:59:00]  And he's going to comment as, I don't know, Adam Sandler or something.  Right?  Right, Frank?  Hey, here we go.  This is going to be a great bit of some assy-ass action.  Here we go.  Hey, take it off.  Come on.  Yeah, yeah.  Say your name.  Wait a second.  I don't know.  I feel like a porno team.  Your name's Amber?  Uh-huh.  All right.  Say your name, and then, yeah, drop your drawers.  Oh, my gosh.  She's starting to do it.  Oh, hey, so nice.  Hey, so nice.  It's all curvy.  It makes me want to smile. 
[01:59:30]  I've got a smile on my face.  Oh, there it goes.  Pull the pants back up.  Pants are up, and the beautiful fleshiness has become gray matter.  Well, if you came down just to walk around for yourself.  Maybe that would be a great suggestion.  I guess Opie and Anthony would love to see that.  A walk around, talk around.  Minus the talk around.  There you go.  Take a little jog.  Yeah, you could take a little jog. 
[02:00:00]  What are you wearing there?  Oh, their little thong.  It's got, what is it got?  A sequin thing?  Is that, would I dare to say that's see-through?  Yeah, I saw the front of that.  Oh, and can I also dare to say, I can play Guess What's in Your Pants without a phone?  Yeah, I see that.  Can I say wood floor?  Yep.  Yeah.  You notice that, Bryce?  That's freshly done, right?  She's two feet away from you.  Talk about the Boston Garden.  There you go.  Wow.  Hello.  Welcome to New York. 
[02:00:30]  Bravo.  Amber.  Who else do we have?  I'm Melissa.  Hi, Melissa.  Where are you from?  I'm from Jersey.  Okay.  Did you say hi to Frank Caliendo?  He's a very funny guy.  How you doing, Frank?  Hi.  Way to rock.  It's my understanding that you're going to have a preview here, but before I show you  anything, I need you to understand that I did go tanning today.  So minus the right.  You went tanning?  I did.  Oh, and you stayed in the thing a little long and your butt cheeks got all red and all right?  Yeah, but I thought it might add something.  Sure.  Oh, why not?  A little rosy.  Yeah.  Well, look at this.  Brian Regan's going to comment about your butt. 
[02:01:00]  Somebody went to the tanning salon.  Went to the tanning, got a little red, got red on her ass.  Got a red ass like Rudolph in reverse.  Takes a second, but it gets to.  You take a little time.  Maybe if I bend over, add the quotient to ten, cross my eye a little, be a little funnier,  huh?  Anthony.  Anthony and I were talking about that while the break was on.  Well, during the break, we were talking about it.  Show me your ass.  Almost forgot about the ass contest. 
[02:01:30]  Ass contest going on.  He doesn't do that.  Why would I do that?  Yeah, he doesn't.  All of a sudden, it was Captain Kirk.  Well, it seems to be the problem.  I...  Somebody got confused what impression he was doing.  Forgot.  Yeah, he doesn't do that blue material, Brian Regan.  He keeps it clear.  You're the guy who wanted me to do an ass contest.  Okay, time for the butt contest.  Oh, I thought we forgot.  All right, Melissa, let's take a look.  Where are you from?  Let's see her red ass.  Jersey, okay.  Damn red monkey ass. 
[02:02:00]  Yes.  Yes.  She brought the pants down.  There's an ass there.  Let's see.  There you go.  Nothing wrong with the leg.  That is red.  It looks like it's been freshly smacked.  Yeah, and you know, like, you lay and you get this part, like, pressing flat.  Oh, yeah, I understand.  It's always barbecued, yeah.  I understand that when you're laying, yes.  Brave out.  Got to be careful with the ass contest prep time.  Things they say are pretty dumb.  Sorry about that. 
[02:02:30]  I'm not the real Regan.  The real Regan would have said something interesting.  I didn't say anything interesting.  It just kind of said the same thing over.  Back to Adam Sandler.  Here we go.  What's going on?  All right.  Who else we got?  I'm just here for moral support.  I'm Deb the Dyke.  Hey, you're Deb the Dyke?  Wow, Deb the Dyke.  You've called our show.  There you go.  And we said, come on by so we can take a look at you.  Who has the mullet haircut?  What did we ask you?  We said that she, we asked if she had the mullet haircut.  Sure. 
[02:03:00]  But she doesn't.  She's more like a lipstick lesbian type.  I thought you guys would be a little surprised.  Yeah.  Yeah, we asked you if you had the mullet.  Yeah.  And she doesn't have the mullet.  Hey, look at that.  Chris Farley wants to say hi to Deb the Dyke.  Deb the Dyke, how are you?  Doing good.  Without a mullet.  Kind of surprised all of us.  We weren't sure what to look forward to.  But now we've seen it all.  You have a weight problem, okie doke.  So what are you doing with us here, Deb? 
[02:03:30]  Deb the Dyke today?  What are you doing?  Well, I brought Allison with me.  Allison?  Well, she's going to show us her patootie.  Time for a patootie showing.  Take a look at the...  I forgot the word, but I was going to put it in the quotes.  But that's ok, we're on radio.  People aren't sure what's happening.  Okie.  Well, as they say in a lot of places, show us your goods.  Alright.  Here she goes, lifting up that... 
[02:04:00]  Wow.  Very good.  Yes.  Hey.  Hey, Deb.  What do you do for a living there?  Oh.  I'm going to prepare a makeup.  Oh, yeah?  Effects.  I just finished working on independent film.  Oh, yeah?  Can I give that a little plug?  Hey, sure.  Yeah.  www.sinsofthefather.net  Sins of the Father.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  That's a different kind of movie to me.  Yeah.  How do you get it?  Forget it. 
[02:04:30]  Going back to Regan.  Sorry.  Explain Sins of the Father.  Um, it's a, uh, a mob, church, corrupt, cop, slash, slash, slash.  You know, it's sort of...  Wow.  Is there a monster in it, too?  I mean, there's a little bit of everything.  What kind of sins, though?  Well, it's, uh, falling in love.  Ah.  Really?  The forbidden.  But there's no, you know, small children involved, so it's okay.  Hey, uh, look at this.  Robin Williams has a comment about, uh, sins of the father.  Oh, God, it's amazing and wonderful. 
[02:05:00]  If you watched it, you'd understand there's so much going on, so little to absorb.  It's an amazing thing.  I've seen so many movies that need to be redone all at once, and that's the one.  Sins of the Father.  Look out for Sins of the Mother.  It's like the same, but you same age, slightly different.  You know, that didn't work out.  Okay.  Sometimes...  That's exactly what Robin Williams does.  Sometimes there's a joke.  Sometimes there isn't.  Sometimes you are one.  Okay?  It's a more accurate, Robin, if there isn't a joke there.  Come on, man.  It's got to talk.  But, man, we're friends, you know?  We go way back to... 
[02:05:30]  See?  See?  It's like the Regan bit.  Can't ever finish it.  Don't know the words.  Well, what's going on?  This is all so weird, you know?  All right.  Who else do we have?  By the way, great ask.  Okay.  Yeah, that was very nice.  Thank you.  Sinsofthefather.com, right?  Thank you.  There you go.  Who are you?  My name is Adriana.  Hey, Adriana.  Yes.  And you're entering the best-ass contest.  Yes, I am.  Yes.  Yes. 
[02:06:00]  Do you know who you're staring at over there?  Who, Opie?  It's Newman from Seinfeld.  Hello, Opie.  So, do those deals come off?  Yes, very easily, too.  It's the whole cast of Seinfeld.  I can't believe it.  She's going to take off her clothes.  Why don't she take off her clothes?  She's going to show us her ass.  Yeah.  That was a good time to play that song.  I know. 
[02:06:30]  Let's go.  Drop the Gina Rudings.  Okay.  There they do, Kenny.  Hello.  Slowly, but no slower.  There it is.  Oh, hello.  Hey, look at that.  Yes.  Another fine ass.  She just let the cat right out of the bank, if you know what I mean.  Okay.  Ron. 
[02:07:00]  We don't even know who we are anymore.  I know.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  It's okay.  Don't worry about it, Oprah.  That was very good.  Who else do we have?  This just in, Sins of the Father, already made more money than Cherry Falls.  Jay Moore's movie.  Yes, your name?  My name is Debra.  Hi, Debra.  How are you?  Pretty good.  You know, that's Jay Leno.  Jay Leno.  You weren't even sure how to put that one together.  Thanks a lot, Opie.  Let's see what you, here on the Tonight Show, we're doing something a little different. 
[02:07:30]  We're going to be doing ass contests as well.  Could you give us a little preview of the ass for the Tonight Show we're going to be doing?  Is this bit not working with anyone?  Do you guys get it?  I said ass contests on the Tonight Show.  That's the funny part.  They really wouldn't do that on the Tonight Show from explaining it.  Maybe if I did it like Regan.  It's going to have an ass contest.  It's going to have an ass contest.  It's going to have an ass contest.  Not an ass contest.  That'd be a picnic contest.  Wait a second.  It's only got silent in the... 
[02:08:00]  It's only got silent in here.  Ladies and gentlemen, I was trying to do it regularly, Jay Leno, when it came out.  It's Regan again.  Sorry about that.  Do you realize the longer you do that, the longer she's waiting to take her pants off?  Yeah.  Done.  A ding.  Yeah.  Oh, yes.  Now, have you been told you have a nice ass?  Yeah.  See, I think of all the girls that are entering this contest, somebody has told them that, 
[02:08:30]  wow, you've got a nice ass.  Right?  There you go.  Well...  It's going to be very hard to pick finalists over.  So why don't we ask Al Pacino over there?  My God.  I'll tell you what, that's Thanksgiving for a guy like me.  Right there.  Hello.  She just bent down and showed me where it's coming from, if you know what I mean.  Wait a second.  Do that again.  I was turned away.  Oh, my God.  Someone's got a stiff friend.  Got a little gift coming at you.  And I'm looking straight ahead, and I'm seeing everything she's got. 
[02:09:00]  All right, Al, that's called Scent of a Woman.  Hoo-ah.  You can beat me to it sometimes.  Sometimes the guy with the voices needs you to write that on a piece of paper so he gets  a joke.  Sometimes the guy with the voices can't think of the funny jokes, the funny material.  So maybe, instead of you being the damn funny one...  Actually, I think that was deserving.  Nice job for the Uber.  Come on, give him a clap.  My headphones for love. 
[02:09:30]  Sorry about that.  You know what I love about you?  The fact that your pants are still down.  Well, that's because John Madden wants to draw circles.  See, right there's a lot of places, great places to draw circles on there.  They're jiggling around.  It's like Jell-O.  That has nothing to do with anything except for me enjoying myself. 
[02:10:00]  Clap.  Yeah.  Whah.  You can't do that anymore, and you're going to get wet.  Just stop it.  I'm like an inch away.  She's slapping it like I can't.  Hey, isn't that?  Wow.  Oh, my God.  I'm hearing a rumor that John Madden does Schwarzenegger.  What?  What does that even mean?  Hey, there's a bomb.  Hey, I don't say a lot in the movies. 
[02:10:30]  I'll be back.  Look out.  I'll be back.  He'll be back.  See, it's a voicing.  Yeah.  Well, that's a very nice...  All the ladies have nice asses.  Thank you.  What?  I thought you were going to help me put them back in.  You know what?  More see-through panties.  I wish.  See that, Anthony?  All see-through panties.  Yeah, look at the...  Okay, can I play a guess what's in your pants?  Wood floor.  Mohawk.  No, there's a... 
[02:11:00]  What's in there?  There's a little, isn't there?  There's a little...  There's a seam, so it's hard to see.  Not that big.  It's a Hitler mustache.  Exactly.  Hitler mustache.  It was hiding in there, Opie.  Hitler's hiding.  I see that.  It was in the bunker.  It was in the bunker.  I couldn't see.  Ray?  Ray?  Yes, Ray?  Hey, I wonder if Norm MacDonald could tell me about that girl's ass.  Oh, my God.  Maybe...  Hey, could you take your pants down again there? 
[02:11:30]  He needs to be...  This girl...  What's his voice on?  What are you talking about there?  Norm MacDonald.  Hey, take a look at that.  That's a crack whore there.  That's a...  I'm just kidding there, lady.  It didn't mean about you there.  It was a crack joke about the ass there.  Not about you there.  God.  Oh, God.  Can somebody help me there?  You're a great...  No, lady.  Lady, you got a great ass, you know.  But, uh...  But, uh...  But, uh, what?  But, uh, I don't have any... 
[02:12:00]  But, uh, I'm in a what?  But, uh, I'm in a what?  But, uh, I'm a little bit out of, uh, things to say here.  You do?  Opie, could you write something down for me there?  Opie, give it up.  Well, it's got...  She keeps doing this shake, and I start shaking, you know, like, oh, my God.  Come on.  You know how to work your body.  That's obvious.  I hope so.  Yeah, you're doing a good job.  You ever, uh, you ever work that thing there?  That's a stupid question.  What do you think?  Well, it's Norm MacDonald, though.  Yeah, you know.  It's like, uh, it's like, uh... 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  Hey, I gotta go back to Madden, because I can't remember anything to say.  I can't believe the, uh, the Norm guy, his speech was there.  Is our ass red from smackin' it?  That's a...  Come on.  Hey, yeah.  I told you.  Hey, I got a lawsuit pending for something like this already there.  Yeah, that's good.  Keep doing that.  Very nice. 
[02:13:00]  Keep doing that.  Well...  Yeah, keep doing that.  Well, we have to take a break.  I do believe we have a room full of finalists, Anthony, for the Best Ass Contest.  Absolutely.  Now, see, this is taking up the Ass Contest.  Seriously, we say it to all the ladies, but these asses are very nice, right, Ant?  Bravo.  And, uh, the final...  Very nice.  The winner's gonna go to Vegas.  Yeah.  Vegas, thanks, uh, thanks to Gear Magazine.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, and the Best Ass Contest is sponsored by Hornigot Weed.  Pinnacle of Hornigot Weed, right?  Good job, ladies. 
[02:13:30]  Very nice.  Rick's gonna have these pictures up on www.com very, very soon.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  You know, you bitches can leave.  You know, you did your job where you take your pants off there.  Now it's time to get out of the room.  Or stay.  Do whatever you want there.  But, uh, that's the normal procedure.  And Frank Caliendo hanging out with us.  He's, uh, gonna be at Bananas in Hasbrook Heights Friday and Saturday night.  Two shows, 8 p.m. and 1045. 
[02:14:00]  Call for tickets.  They go fast.  I'm telling you.  201-727-1090.  You're hanging for a little while, right?  Oh, you love it.  Hey, what?  I should have said it like that.  Like, hey, I'm cool.  Yeah.  We're getting a lot of requests for something you did last time you were on the show.  What was that?  The whole Seinfeld thing.  Oh, you want me to do it again?  No, we'll get it on tape.  Oh, good.  So you can't even have to do anything.  Anytime you can do less work, do it.  What are you doing?  So you can rest and just drink your soda.  We'll be back, all right?  All right.  It's Frank Caliendo.  I did, like, a whole cast of Seinfeld in, like, an anti-drug episode. 
[02:14:30]  If they never did stuff like that, that would have been funnier, like,  Tonight, on a very special Seinfeld, Jerry's been doing drugs.  Now, ding, ding, dong, ding.  Why do my fingers look like little people?  Who are these people?  What are they doing?  They're talking to each other.  They're talking about me.  What are they saying?  George, help me, George.  I have no idea, Jerry.  No idea.  Somebody help me.  Hey, Jerry, you look like you've been seeing little people on your fingers.  All this comedy all these years.  We thought you're making this stuff up.  Well, I guess you just let the cat...  Right out of the back.  You can't tell. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, I can tell.  It's written all over your face.  I'm wondering on my face.  Well, maybe that was the little people on your fingers.  They're going to tell this to me.  Newman.  Hello, Jerry.  Hello, Newman.  I said, we'll roll some set up.  Jerry, go see it.  Break the dead.  Come over to the stabs.  Have you seen them?  Have you seen them?  I licked them.  Now, I'm seeing little people on my fingers.  You guys, you ruined my life.  You ruined everybody's life.  In fact, you're the guy who dropped that thing and ruined Jurassic Park.  And you guys got it. 
[02:15:30]  The first radio station ever to get my bitch.  Come on.  That's great.  That was Newman.  Bravo, man.  Newman screwed the whole damn thing up.  Jerry, I'm back again.  She's driving that Jeep in the mud.  Yeah.  There's nothing better than a good Newman.  I love it.  We're still stupid.  Well, if that's what it takes to get good ratings, we'll continue being stupid.  We don't care.  We don't care.  I've been expecting you to make exactly that asinine statement.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:16:00]  Theater of the Mindless.  1027.  WNEW.  By Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027.  WNEW.  New York.  What a show today, Anthony.  Yes, Opie.  I have to fix my headphones.  That's all right.  We've been all over the ball field today.  Henry Rollins.  Now Frank Caliendo, who's going to be at Bananas in Hasbrook Heights Friday and Saturday night. 
[02:16:30]  Two shows.  8 o'clock and 1045.  Call 201-727-1090 for reservations.  Frank is hilarious.  And we recommend you go check him out, okay?  Yes.  Um, I need an answer quickly.  Somebody around here is a rat.  Rat.  Who gave my number to Dice?  Who gave my home phone number to Dice? 
[02:17:00]  You know it wasn't me.  Did you?  Yeah.  Sorry about it.  What are you going to do?  Kick my ass.  Who did it?  I got some good ones.  You know it wasn't me.  Dice didn't have my number.  I moved.  He had my old number.  I don't know how he got my new number.  But when the phone rings last night and I pick it up and I hear, hello?  Like, yeah, hello?  Ha, ha, ha.  How you take it?  Like, what?  I didn't even know who it was. 
[02:17:30]  How you take it?  Take what?  Medium or well done?  Medium.  Now, you haven't talked to him in a few months.  No.  This is how he starts.  This is how he starts the conversation.  Okay.  I go, medium?  Uh-uh.  How you take it?  Well done.  Uh-uh.  And I'm waiting on the phone and I'm wondering what the right answer is. 
[02:18:00]  How you take it?  Medium or well done?  Then I'm thinking how I'd really like it.  So I go, medium rare?  Yeah!  Yeah!  You see now?  I'm like, no, I don't understand what you're talking about.  How you take it?  I want to reach through the phone and smack him.  And then I'm starting to think, who gave him my number?  But you forgot the best part.  You or Rick?  No, you know.  When I tell you I didn't give him the number, you have to believe me. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  That's how we've been for seven years, okay?  How you take it?  Don't insult me.  You forgot the best part of the conversation, though.  What?  After he was done, what did he say to you?  He goes, isn't that ridiculous?  That's my new thing.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's my new thing I do.  I go around and I say, how do you take it?  Medium or well done?  And it's never the right answer.  What?  That's what I do now.  That's what I do now.  And no matter what you say, you go, rare? 
[02:19:00]  Uh-huh.  And I make you wait.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Until you say medium rare.  And then he goes, yeah!  The guy's out of his mind.  And someone gave it.  I was safe.  I was safe without any calls from the dice man.  Well, when he calls Rick, it's a two-hour conversation.  Did you give Dice my number?  Did I give Dice my number?  Did you give Dice my home phone number?  No.  I haven't spoken to Dice in months.  Don't look at me.  You can look at me.  Someone has now subjected me to screening my calls again. 
[02:19:30]  There wasn't one person I would screen calls for.  We all know who Dice calls.  Me, usually.  It's Opie.  But I didn't give him Anthony's number.  Now I've got to wait.  Does he really do this?  This is fine.  And, Frank, it goes on for hours.  Like, I was on the phone last night, and I'm trying to work myself through the...  You've got to understand, because it happens to both of us.  You would think it would be a pleasure to answer your phone at home and talk to Dice. 
[02:20:00]  You know?  How do you take it?  Hello?  Are you in?  Right.  Medium or well done?  Can't you do, like, a fake static or something?  Medium.  Right, right, right.  Ah, ah.  Medium.  That's my new thing.  You cannot get off the phone.  Minimum of two hours of your time.  It was an hour and a half last night.  And most of the time, I got the phone, and I got, you know, my neck, shoulder thing, so my hands are free. 
[02:20:30]  And I'm running through the lands that are the game of EverQuest.  And I'm killing gnolls, and I'm doing stupid things.  And Dice is talking to me.  Every so often, I just go, yeah?  Oh, yeah?  How about that?  And then every so often, I hear him just talking, like, because I'm not listening.  And then I just go, medium rare?  Yeah.  And I keep playing.  The best is, he calls from his garage, and throughout the conversation, you hear him yelling at his family. 
[02:21:00]  He's never interrupting him.  And then, how about this one?  Yeah, okay, two minutes.  I got to get off.  That, when you hear that, you know that it's only a half hour left.  Right.  I got to get off.  The wife's all pissed off at me now.  I have to go.  Because he has to take her to dinner or something.  Yeah.  But then he's like, all right, hey, hey, come on, I'm talking over here.  And then it's another half hour.  And then I start going, hey, Dice, you know, I better let you go. 
[02:21:30]  No, I got a couple of minutes.  A couple more minutes.  Like, no, Dice, I don't have a couple of minutes, Dice.  I can take it.  He loves the Dice Dice baby, right?  Oh, that's what he was saying.  He called up.  He goes, Opie left it on my machine.  I love that.  It's a good beat.  Dice Dice baby.  So he wants a copy of that.  Well, let's play it.  Because you left it for him on the answering machine.  Yeah, we'll play it really fast.  And then we'll get back to Frank Caliendo.  Yes, I just had to call someone out because somebody's a goddamn rat around here and gave  my phone number to Dice.  Girl. 
[02:22:00]  Dice, Dice baby.  Dice checking in from over here.  Dice, Dice baby.  Oh, it's so nice.  Dice, Dice baby.  Oh.  Nice, nice, baby  Nice, nice, baby  Nice, nice, baby  I'm in the heat, my  Nice, nice, baby  Gotta love the time 
[02:22:30]  Look at it!  Look at it!  I got a hat, man.  I got your legs.  Okay, terrific.  Don't just stare at it, eat it.  Just look at me like a chick with bulls. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, that's nice.  Dice Dice Baby.  He's a jack-o-fix point, you'll see.  Dice Dice Baby.  He's a scumbag.  Dice Dice Baby.  I'm over here.  Dice Dice Baby.  I'm good like that, my friend.  Get full of crap.  Look what we did to you again.  There you have it.  Dice Dice Baby by Drew Boogie.  He wants that.  I know, I know. 
[02:23:30]  He wants it bad.  I know.  We'll be sending it out to L.A.  Immediately.  I'm just wondering.  Frank Caliendo.  One appearance away before you get your own remix.  From Drew Boogie.  Oh, yes.  Drew Boogie will put a remix together for you.  What?  It'll be kind of like that with your voices and stuff.  Oh, like Caliendo, Caliendo, baby?  Caliendo, Caliendo, baby.  Joe, what's up?  He's got a couple of more songs, maybe.  Yeah.  Joe?  Frank, you're funny as hell.  Thanks. 
[02:24:00]  I've got a question for you.  Do you ever get confused with your impressions?  Like you mean to do Madden, but it comes out as like norm or something?  I think that's happened like four times today.  I was going to say.  Yeah, and on stage, sometimes they'll mix and it becomes a new bit somehow.  They'll be doing like Rick Moranis and something else.  It'll be like Rick De Niro.  Yeah.  Great.  That was okay.  I've got to have a shower.  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Hey, Anthony, I was talking to Al Pacino during the break. 
[02:24:30]  Of course you were.  Yeah, he's right here.  Is that tongue in your cheek or what?  And he was telling me that John Madden and Pat Summerall do some kind of like Titanic thing.  Oh, really?  It would be great to see those guys do a movie for men and women.  For men, it would be the football.  For women, it would be Titanic.  So here we go.  I think it would go something like this.  Pat Summerall and John Madden. 
[02:25:00]  Are you guys ready for this?  Yeah.  That was one of those times where I was going to go into something and I did the wrong thing.  Whap!  You get confused a lot, don't you, Frank?  All these voices in your head talking to each other.  No idea.  Yeah.  No idea.  Pat Summerall and John Madden in Titanic.  We've had a nice...  Wait, wait.  You know what?  Let's stop it.  Let's play the music.  Yeah, we need music for it.  Make it a little more realistic.  Might help you through this one.  And if I weren't here, professional. 
[02:25:30]  But to Frank, everything's on through.  Frank can't do something.  Oh, here we go.  All right, wait.  Take care.  No, no.  Oh, that's all there is?  No.  Oh, no.  Better not be.  Pat Summerall and John Madden in Titanic.  We've hit an iceberg.  There's a leak in the ship.  The water's to the 20.  To the 25.  We're going down.  See, if your ship hits an iceberg, what's going to happen is water's going to fill the ship over here. 
[02:26:00]  It's going to break in half over here.  This part's going to come across.  The guy's going to fall off the top and hit his head on the propeller on the way down.  You're going to laugh and feel bad about it.  And then lead out of the capital's going to die and girls will get pissed off.  Thanks, John.  I'm near, far, wherever you are, far across the water.  I don't know the words.  Here's my remix, guys.  The Cali and the Remix.  Hey, don't sing the words while they're going on. 
[02:26:30]  Just sing your own thing.  What the hell are you there?  What happens when I talk?  That was good.  That was good.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey, I was wondering.  He was doing all the Saturday Night Live guys.  Does he do a real cool one like Tim Meadows, maybe?  Yeah, I got a great Tim Meadows.  If you haven't noticed, Frank does funny people.  That's my point.  That's my point.  No, he's been great.  Hey, can I do a quick one for him?  Yeah.  Can I ask him a question?  I got a question for John Matt. 
[02:27:00]  Hey, go ahead, Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hi, this is Pat Summerall from I've took the end of bed.  No good?  Hey, that's pretty good.  I love our Michaels.  Yeah.  I'll leave it to the pros.  Goodbye.  Actually, yeah, it was pretty good.  I'm not going to...  I'm not going to...  I'm not going to...  I'm not going to...  I'm not going to...  I'm not going to diss you.  All right.  Texas Stadium.  Thank you, Joe.  This guy keeps going on and on.  Yeah.  Brian.  Hey, what's up?  Hey. 
[02:27:30]  I heard you talking about Dice a few minutes ago.  Yeah.  And, you know, I just noticed, like, I've been listening to the radio for a long time now.  And, like, the early morning show that's on, that, you know, it's still on now.  Right.  I don't want to say the station or nothing, you know, but a long time ago, he was involved  with him.  And, like, you know, he was doing good and stuff, and then they had, like, words between  each other, and then you didn't hear about Dice for a long time.  All of a sudden, you two guys bring Dice up, and, like, everybody...  You know, he's going all over the place again. 
[02:28:00]  What's up with that?  Now, you know, you guys are having a little bit of problems, and it seemed like he was,  like, you know, like, you don't talk about him as much anymore, you know?  Oh, because our show goes in many directions.  Yeah.  There's people that come on the show, and then they're gone for a while, and they come back,  and...  I'll tell you this.  Dice is coming back on the show in the very near future.  Really?  Yeah.  And he's been busy.  He's been all over the place and doing stuff, so...  It's just what our show is.  People come and go.  Yeah.  You guys are a person when he's on the phone.  You think Frank wants to hang with us?  Who's Frank? 
[02:28:30]  Who's this guy?  I'm only kidding.  Oh, that's a good joke.  I liked it.  How do you hang up?  We're like...  Our show is like a Navy port whore.  You know what I mean?  We're there.  We're there for you.  You know, the ship is going to go away.  It's going to sail around the world.  There are other whores around.  But when you're back in our part of the globe, you'll give us...  You'll throw us a bang in again.  Yeah.  That, by the way, is my new favorite analogy ever.  Ever?  Ever, ever, ever.  It's a show like Navy port whore. 
[02:29:00]  All right.  The show must go on, guys.  That's unbelievable.  All right.  I want to talk to Abby, but...  Abby, come on.  Thank you.  Abby, what's up?  Hello?  My name is Tom, and you guys don't treat Angel very good.  All right.  Who's screen of the calls?  Yeah.  Who is that screen of the calls?  Who would let that brew?  Was that a jerky boy wannabe?  Sounded like it.  Very injured.  Who doesn't know the jerky boys anymore? 
[02:29:30]  I know.  Hi.  Could I have a pizza?  Is this one of the jerky boys?  Yeah.  You have to know it's them.  Otherwise, you haven't been on the planet.  Is your refrigerator running, sir?  Who's your...  Yeah, jerky boys?  Who's getting fooled by us?  She got fooled.  Tell her.  That's why I wasn't putting it through.  What?  Because I thought that it was somebody making fun of us.  Oh, so you put it...  You were screening the calls?  Yeah.  Isn't that cute?  And then you're like, who's Abby?  Who's Abby?  So I...  Oh, now that's okay if you do it. 
[02:30:00]  Because you're cute and stuff.  And look, the girl does it.  If that was one of the guys, you'd be like,  Dude, what are you, an effing a-hole?  These socks, you cut it.  What are you screening the calls?  You jerk off it?  She does it like,  Oh, I let it through because I thought he was going to go by.  He's okay.  That's okay.  You go back to screening.  You know...  Guys, that's what I love about you guys.  Total honesty in this.  You see how we're smiling? 
[02:30:30]  You're going to yell at us.  We're so intense when someone makes a mistake right here.  We threw a guy on for wearing a goddamn bandage on his head.  He didn't have a cut underneath him.  He took the bandage off.  There was no cut.  He was fired.  I swear to God.  And then he flushed somebody through like that.  He's okay.  Frank seems a little confused.  But yeah, want to explain to him really fast?  One of our interns, he said he got in a car accident.  And he comes in. 
[02:31:00]  Now, when you say you're in a car accident, wouldn't you wrap your leg up in an ace bandage or your arm?  Something.  He comes in with this big Warner Brothers cartoon bandage on his head.  And if that wasn't enough.  From the Acme medical kit.  Yeah.  Just one of those big block bandages.  And if that wasn't enough, he felt he had to add a pirate eye patch to complete the whole thing.  I swear to you.  It was a black R. Mady pirate eye patch.  You can't write stuff like this, Frank.  So he comes in. 
[02:31:30]  He says he was making a left turn.  A motorcycle came up on his left side as he was turning and hit him in the door.  Hard enough that his head went through the driver's side window, cutting his forehead and needing the patch because he got glass in his eye.  So he's walking around.  And before the show, we're all looking just going, this kid is so full of crap.  There's nothing.  There wasn't even those.  If you get stitches from a car accident and it's under a bandage, there are other injuries that don't warrant a bandage. 
[02:32:00]  But you can see the other nicks from the glass and whatnot.  He's fine.  There's not a bruise, nothing.  Who was the one who took it off of him?  Well, we called him in on it.  He said, all right, get in here when the show started.  So we go, okay, we got him on mic.  He's talking.  And we said, we're not really buying the car accident thing.  Could you take the bandage off?  If we see stitches, we know it's legit.  If we don't, you're fired.  He goes, I can't.  My doctor said not to take it off. 
[02:32:30]  So we were just like, ah, take the patch off your eye.  Lift it up.  And he's doing this fake blinking thing.  Doing the big fake blinking thing.  And we go, hold it open on the bottom just so we could see.  It looked like the healthiest eyeball I'd ever seen.  Not a trace of red, no bloodshot, nothing.  So finally, he admits that maybe he exaggerated the accident a bit.  And his head didn't go through the window.  Wasn't he late for work?  Is that why?  He missed a day.  He missed two days the week before.  Now, you got to, maybe you fire him, but maybe you give him a little something for initiative. 
[02:33:00]  That's funny.  This was just so out there.  This was like, we were calling him single white male.  It was like that weird.  Wouldn't you have done the same thing, though?  But you banded your arm or something.  Not an iPad.  And he's doing stuff we could really see.  A thin layer of band-aids.  You're right.  You call in and do the sick voice, anything.  You don't show up with an eye patch and a bandage on your head.  A pirate eye patch.  So, Frank, we make him take the bandage off.  And it was so awkward because he was still believing in his mind that he really had stitches on him. 
[02:33:30]  We also had problems with the accident because we said, okay, what happened to the motorcycle guy?  If he hits your car hard enough where the car now slides over enough where your head goes through the window, that bike had to be effed up.  He drove away.  The motorcycle guy drove away.  I saw him later.  He had a band-aid on a pinky.  Yeah.  Gary Busey hit him. 
[02:34:00]  So, when he pulled the bandage off.  Yeah, we finally got him.  He goes, okay, yeah, I exaggerated it.  I don't have stitches.  Okay, let's see the cut.  So, he slowly unveils this cut, peels the bandage off.  The whole time, though, he's working.  Yeah.  Nothing.  He's working.  He's got to go, see, right here, right here, right here, right here.  And then the bandage is off.  He's like, well, nothing.  And then it was this awkward silence.  It was like, pick any part of your body where you have never been cut in your life.  That's how pristine it was.  Well, that's where you go.  That's where nothing's right.  I go, well, it really affected my brain. 
[02:34:30]  Right.  Yeah.  I'm a head trauma.  I've got a head trauma.  Because the way you've got a head trauma, I'm not thinking clearly.  I'm not thinking clearly.  Voice mixed up in my head.  I was hit by a moosin'.  A box of moosin'.  A box and a moosin'.  Donut lady.  Hit me, a donut lady.  Are we replaying that on Saturday?  Which one?  Brian, the intern?  If you want to, yeah.  Yeah, we've got to replay it. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, no.  I miss work.  What am I going to do?  I've got to get a big patch for my eye.  I've got to get an eye patch for my eye.  A big patch for my eye.  I could get a scooter.  A scooter.  I could get a driving scooter.  Motorized scooter.  Maybe a scooter.  A scooter.  Maybe a scooter and a body bag.  And it'll look real bad.  It'll look worse than the patch.  Tone it down.  Tone it down.  Bring the guys a scooter pie.  It's an apology for my fake wound. 
[02:35:30]  He was...  And then he talked about having some kind of a surgery on his ankle the week before.  And he goes to therapy for it every week.  So he said, let's look at the scar on your ankle for the surgery.  He pulls it up right before.  He goes, well, it was orthoscopic surgery, so there's not much of a scar.  We're like, okay, we'll buy that.  He pulls the sock down.  He pointed to a mole on his ankle and said, well, here's where it is. 
[02:36:00]  Swear to God.  And then friends of his were calling, going, that's why we call him old Lion Brian.  His name's Brian.  Lion Brian.  Actually, his name's Bill.  But they figured Brian.  He told us Brian.  That's Bill Heathrow.  He's been around for a while.  We call him Lion Brian because his name's Bill.  He said it was Brian.  And it didn't fit Lion Bill.  So, yeah.  We're going to replay that Saturday, hopefully, during our Worst of Show, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., I believe. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, okay.  You know, it's funny, too.  If you see the clip, we have the clip up on the website.  As he pulls the bandage off, and we start pointing out there's nothing there.  He goes, really?  Yeah, you're like you've been healed.  It's a miracle.  He had the incredible Hulk kind of healing.  It just happens.  It just goes away.  He doesn't even realize it.  All right, Anthony, we've got to remind everyone we're doing a road show next Thursday night  at the Vanderbilt in Plainview on Long Island, 21 and over, no cover. 
[02:37:00]  It's going to be great.  If you've never been to one of these road shows, come on down and enjoy the festivities.  Yes.  A lot of the people you know and love from the show will be on hand, including like the retarded Laverne.  Shirley, old Dirty, a bunch of the comedians, the Ants Band's playing, some of the girls  from the Best Ass Contest.  It's just going to be great.  It's going to be a debauchery mania.  And we'll have directions on the website and all that, okay?  Do you guys do a softball game or something, too? 
[02:37:30]  You want to play?  Matt Frost was telling me about that.  Frosty.  We played last year.  Yeah.  Bikini softball.  Just picture, it was in Newark.  I don't even know if we're invited back this year.  Are we?  Newark Fair Stadium.  Yeah, they actually liked us.  Really?  Picture 6,000 people showing up for a softball game and no one watching what's going on on the field.  Who cares?  Yeah, it was amazing.  That's awesome.  You've got to play.  When is it?  In the summer sometime.  Maybe I'll even get an announcer and do some Harry Carey for you. 
[02:38:00]  Do you do Harry Carey?  I've got a Harry for you.  All right, let's take a break.  I would love to hear you, Harry Carey.  We love Harry Carey.  By the way, Opie struck out Jay Moore last year.  Yeah, Jay struck out his first at-bat.  Does he do his at-bats like walking?  I'm going to hit now.  Why is it everybody on Earth does a Jay Moore, Christopher, walking now?  He's got the best walking, like thousands of people.  I'm sounding like Jay.  Yeah. 
[02:38:30]  Why do I sound like Jay?  Even walking, like, I sound like you.  All right, we'll take a quick break.  Frank Caliendo, he'll do his Harry Carey next.  He's playing Bananas, Hasbroke Hikes, Friday and Saturday, two shows, 8 and 1045.  We highly recommend you check it out if you have nothing going on this weekend.  201-727-1090 for ticket info.  David Duke doing stand-up at the Apollo.  Oh, we'll get more laughs in this crowd.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:39:00]  Hello, T7-WNEW.  Saturday night, starting at 7, WNEW gives you wheeze.  Hey, what's up, wheezer?  And cheese.  Cheese, my, terrible.  7 to 10, it's Brother Weave, endorsed by Opie and Anthony.  At 10, Eddie Trump cranks out the best variety of metal.  Cheese, my, terrible.  And cheesy airbands on Saturday night rocks.  Cheese, my, terrible.  Nice.  And cheese.  107-WNEW. 
[02:39:30]  Want to thank Frank Caliendo for stopping by today.  Very funny.  We needed this relief after Henry Rollins.  We enjoyed Henry, too, but I mean, you know.  Want to end the show on an up note.  Yes.  I think someone has a comment about our road show.  Quickly.  On line two, Chris. 
[02:40:00]  Chris, you got a question about the road show at the Vanderbilt next week?  Yeah.  I'm curious.  Are we going to have a laser light show there or no?  See, I think he's confused about the Vanderbilt Planetarium.  Long Island, boy.  Long Island in the house.  No, no.  We will not be having our road show at the Vanderbilt Planetarium.  It's the Vanderbilt.  Okay, okay.  I'm sorry.  I was confused.  Are you going to the road show?  Of course I'm going to go.  Give me two seconds if you don't mind.  Yes.  One, you've got to remember, Black Flag was an A-kicking band. 
[02:40:30]  Right.  Okay?  Anthony, come on.  Black Flag was a good band.  Okay, thank you.  Yeah, I have no comment on that because I never really got into Black Flag.  Okay.  And Opie, you're the Malcolm in the middle of the youth family.  Ciao.  Thanks, Chris.  I think that's a compliment.  Our buddy Scorch is checking in, Anthony, if he's still there.  Scorch!  Hey, man.  Scorch is our rock and roll buddy from Utica. 
[02:41:00]  Stop saying Utica, God damn it.  It's Syracuse.  Syracuse.  I say that just to get under your skin.  I know you do, and I love you for it.  And Ben was checking out your website, and he noticed that you're doing your 5,000th show,  is it?  Oh, God.  My 5,000th show is tomorrow morning, yeah, from about 6 to 10.  And it's a big deal.  We have Frank Caliendo, a very funny comedian in the studio.  You've got to explain your radio show to him, so he's in on this.  Explain what?  Your radio show.  Yeah, what's your show about?  My show is about absolutely nothing.  My show is about me making a lot of money for doing a little work. 
[02:41:30]  He calls his show The Kingdom of Nakedness.  The Kingdom of Nakedness.  Actually, tomorrow what I'm going to do is I'm going to have a Show Us Your Hole contest,  which is a...  I'm looking for the most strategic and placed holes in central New York, and there are a lot  of them, so I'm sure that'll be interesting.  What else we're going to have to do?  Holes?  Yeah, Show Us Your Hole contest.  I thought that was the same thing.  Show Us Your Hole contest.  Show Us Your Hole, right.  Yeah, yeah.  And, of course, what do people have to do for Show Us Your Hole?  Well, it's really, as you guys, it's similar to what you're doing about your nicest ass contest, 
[02:42:00]  but in central New York, you really can't say that because there ain't many nice asses  in central New York, on women at least.  But it was pretty good to all other point, and I have nothing to do with my show.  I was listening to you guys a little while ago, and it's funny.  In the big city, they talk about prejudice, the KKK, and this and the other thing.  Here in central New York, they're all yelling about,  that's my cow you're capping, dude!  I mean, that's...  Do they yell that loud when they do it?  Do they scream?  You don't even know. 
[02:42:30]  It's like...  They go from quiet to the couch.  Oh, God.  How will you celebrate 5,000 Kingdom of Nakedness shows?  I am going to get ripped.  I'm going to get ripped, and then I'm going to just keep waiting for you guys  to work your magic in New York City and get me down there.  Because, you see, I've got to thank all your listeners.  I get, on an average daily basis, I bet you I get 15 or 20 emails  from people that have heard me on your show.  Yeah, you've got to come down and hang with us.  I am definitely going to... 
[02:43:00]  You invite me anytime you want.  You invite me in, and we're going to see how powerful you are.  You go talk to your management, and they're all telling me to get rid of...  Who's the sports babe?  That's all I get.  It's like, we should get rid of the sports babe.  We need you here.  Or there's a couple other people there.  Sports babe?  Hey, Scorch.  Scorch.  How high are you today?  How high am I right now?  Yeah.  Actually, you know what?  I'm not even buzzed right now.  What's your problem?  I've been hanging out at the supermarket all day.  I've been hanging out with...  What do you do?  You go on road shows.  I hang out at supermarkets. 
[02:43:30]  That's the difference between...  What are you doing at a supermarket, Scorch?  I'm hanging out with one of my co-workers.  We're doing a live remote broadcast at a supermarket, dude.  Are you kidding, Scorch?  Oh, no.  Hey, man.  It's a live remote broadcast.  We're here giving out free samples of soda bomb.  Hey, we're here today.  Let me tell you, Scorch, the king of the nakedness.  We're here at the supermarket.  Come on down.  I've got to tell you.  I'm here in the produce section.  You wonder why I want to get out of here.  This guy is miserable. 
[02:44:00]  I've got to...  I mean, so many different stories.  Between the Dave Douglas story and, I mean, I've had everything done to me.  When I was in Nashville, New Hampshire, I had the owner of the station tell me that,  you know, this shaking is...  And this guy is old.  I'm like, Jesus Christ, what the hell are you talking about, man?  That's what we're saying right now.  So I've had it all done.  But, I mean, I appreciate the fact that...  I appreciate the fact that it's been 5,000 shows, man.  That's legitimate.  I've been doing this.  Out of control. 
[02:44:30]  How nice are we that we're promoting a show that none of our listeners will be able to hear tomorrow?  They can hear it.  K-Rock.com.  www.krock.com.  You'll be able to hear it live and in living color from 6 to 10.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Just as always.  There's going to be a cool band there.  Actually, there's a band that's going to be playing in Greenwich Village.  Yeah.  That's coming up.  That's actually playing my show tomorrow.  Their name is Joe Mama and the Soul Train.  So I want to give them a plug, too.  How did your station in Syracuse get K-Rock?  There are like 1,000 K-Rocks all over the country. 
[02:45:00]  There's one here in New York.  There's one in L.A.  How did you get K-Rock?  Because you have your New York K-Rock.  You have your L.A. K-Rock.  But, come on, face the facts, guys.  The Utica Syracuse K-Rock is the big one.  So if you go to www.krock.com, you will get your show tomorrow morning.  You'll get my show tomorrow morning.  Hey, Scorch, do you have one of those radio stations in town called Froggy? 
[02:45:30]  Oh, man, yeah, we have a couple of Froggy's, but they have it.  See, that's the big one.  Every town has to have a Froggy.  Froggy.  Froggy 105.  Hey, we're here on the Frog.  It's 74 Frogrees outside.  I was like, Jesus Almighty.  The first time I heard that, I was like, get me the F out of Central New York.  84 Froggy.  Froggy.  Froggy.  And every one of them is like, jump along, Cassidy.  And what was the guy's name? 
[02:46:00]  There was a guy that quit my station that went to work for the country station.  They started calling him Rivet Redford.  That's funny.  Yeah, there's a frog in every town now.  Remember on the old music radio ABC, 77,  when they used to love when the temperature out was 77,  so they could go, it's 77 ABC degrees.  It really was.  That was like the biggest thing.  If it was 77, they loved spring,  because if it was 77, 77 ABC degrees.  Whoa. 
[02:46:30]  I wonder if they fudged it when it was 76 or 78.  But that was their bit.  I've got to get the degrees thing.  That was their bit.  I've got to have that AM talk thing going on.  But I think you guys are doing great.  I keep telling you.  Of course.  Early in my career, I had to work at one of those Fox stations.  The Fox.  Yeah, the Fox.  There was a Fox in every city, too.  Fox.  The Fox.  You know what I think when I think of Fox.  I think of the guy that used to come out before me at Boston.  It was like, that's the only Fox I really think of.  Whoa, explain Fox to Frank Caliendo.  Everything that is bad about him. 
[02:47:00]  There's one of these guys at every radio station in America, a guy that just stayed in the game way too long.  Yeah, he looked like Iggy Pop, except a little bit taller, maybe a little bit more strung out than Iggy himself.  He was at the station for, I don't know, 25 years.  His voice was shot.  He had, how many different drivers did he go through?  Because he kept getting arrested for drunk driving.  He had to have like, he had 80 different drivers.  There's a guy like this at every station.  And explain Fox, what he, Fox would screw up so bad. 
[02:47:30]  Like, you'd be listening to Fox's show, and there'd be sweepers and promos for a certain day.  You know?  And he would be like, you know, it would be like, party every weekend.  Here, or you're partying this Saturday night with Fox.  And he played on Wednesday.  Like, he wouldn't get it right.  The station that works at work.  And it's Sunday.  Yeah, it's a Saturday afternoon show.  He doesn't know.  He's just throwing things in.  And with the new music on AAF, and he'd go into a classic rock song. 
[02:48:00]  Right, right, right.  Oh, God.  But that's why he is actually, believe it or not, one of the, that's, I got totally sidetracked,  but that's the second reason I came to this supermarket is because Fox is here working.  What's he doing?  He's a bag, he's a, he's actually, he, like, restocked the plastic bag.  He's in the produce aisle.  All right.  Scorch, we're going to let you go.  Go ahead.  Hey, but thank you very much once again.  It's krock.com, and you talk to your boss, because I expect you guys to work your magic.  I want to be in New York City on your station the weekends by middle of April. 
[02:48:30]  One person at a time.  We'll get to you.  You're the man.  All right, Scorch.  Peace, guys.  Later, Scorch.  There you go.  A lot of people saying Scorch still sounds like he gargles with thumbtacks.  That's his voice, though.  I'm miserable.  I like when he goes into his fake voices.  His whole show, he calls it the Kingdom of Nakedness.  Kingdom of Nakedness.  Scorch here in central New York.  When Anthony and I, we went to Boston to work at the same station Scorch did, and we're  driving into town, and we're like, well, let's check out the station. 
[02:49:00]  And here's Scorch doing the Kingdom of Nakedness, telling everyone he's nude.  Totally out of control.  I'm nude radio here.  It's totally nude radio.  Totally nude playing the rock and roll for you.  Scorch.  And we're going to be in the studio within minutes, and we're like, what the hell are we going  to say?  You know who he sounds like?  It's the bus driver from The Simpsons.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Hey, buddy.  Otto, right?  Otto.  Yeah, there you go.  Hey, we were supposed to get a little Harry Caray.  Hey, we need a segue. 
[02:49:30]  John Madden had a video game.  I wish Harry Caray would have had a video game, not a baseball game, because that would  have been too simple.  I wish he'd done play-by-play at Super Mario Brothers, because it would have scared the  crap out of everybody.  He was like, holy cow, Mario, just ate a mushroom.  He's doubled his original size.  Hey, he's going to go kick a Koopa Trooper's ass.  I'd hate to be a Koopa Trooper right now.  Hell, I'd hate to be a Koopa Trooper any time. 
[02:50:00]  They're all green and slimy.  Hey, and this is brought to you by Horny Goatweed.  Hey, and Mario just got to the, wait a second, it wasn't really in case there's a lawyer.  Hey, Mario just got to the end of the level.  You know how I can tell?  He just banged his little Nintendo nuts on a flagpole.  Hey, you might be seeing fireworks, but Mario is seeing stars.  That's great. 
[02:50:30]  That's right on.  Harry Carey.  Hey, everybody.  It's Frank doing another dead impression.  Hey, I got to look out.  We should leave with that.  We can't even play What Did We Learn today.  Oh, I don't even get to.  There were some great ones, too.  I don't get to throw in a Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen reference.  We have to have one every day.  Every day.  There's got to be a Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen reference on this program or something horrible will happen. 
[02:51:00]  And something else we've got to tell everyone.  No, the fish has not been found yet.  Nope.  Not yet.  There's a fish hidden somewhere in this.  In the building.  In the building.  What?  Do you see it?  No.  It's just a fish.  There's no water.  No water.  It's an amazing cloning thing.  It's a dead fish about this big.  And someone's going to discover it very soon.  You don't worry about Luca Brassi.  I'll take care of him. 
[02:51:30]  Ah, man.  Some great ones.  All right.  All right.  Let me try to get a couple in here.  We're running late again.  Frank, what's up?  Hi.  I learned that Opie and Anthony is like a naval whore port for comics.  Right.  I also learned that if I hang up and say I'm going to listen to myself, you'll call me a tool.  There you go.  All right.  Thank you.  Dick.  Tool.  Jimmy, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey, don't.  All right.  Good.  I got a word of line for you.  I got Pat Sumrall and John Madden at Backdoor Action on the off-season. 
[02:52:00]  Hey, that guy knows what he's talking about.  Hey, boys.  Did he have something else?  Yes, John.  John?  Gone now.  I messed him up.  Okay.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  I learned that Rockaway Bedding is 10 more gooder.  Right.  And Anthony, you were wrong.  The Trix Rabbit never got the Trix.  No, the Trix Rabbit got the Trix once.  I remember there was a contest on the back of the box.  You had to vote and cut out the little ballot and mail it in.  If you wanted the Trix Rabbit, they'd get Trix and he won.  And he was able to get Trix. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, what tools.  All right.  Very important things we cover here.  I know.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  All right.  We'll wrap up.  Okay.  Okay.  I don't believe the Lucky Charms.  Leprechaun ever got the Lucky Charms, though.  I'm getting a little nervous.  Do we need more girls for musical dildo chairs?  Well, we got about 10 girls confirmed.  Hey, does it have to be a girl?  Oh, jeez.  Was that bad?  No.  You look at me like, don't say that here.  No.  We like watching the girls sit down in chairs. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  On the chairs.  On the chairs.  They're going to be sitting on the chairs.  Sitting on the chairs.  Oh, no.  That wasn't me that time.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  They're sitting on a chair, but not really on a chair.  Did Dice do in Regan, then?  That's the best.  Hey, they're sitting on a chair, but it ain't really a chair.  You see there?  Because the chair.  Now, what they're sitting on is the chair.  But they're sitting on the chair, in the chair. 
[02:53:30]  And there's a thing on the chair, and it's a cup of dirt.  Okay, donut lady?  So I'm on a line at the donut place, and the donut lady goes,  Oh, how many you want?  I go with ducks and donuts, donut lady.  You got some donuts?  Oh!  Hysterical.  One of the funniest improvs I've ever heard in my entire life from the Boston Square Garden. 
[02:54:00]  Sorry.  Forgetting where I've worked the past 20 years.  I got Anthony coming up with a spectacular improv.  One of the funniest, one of the funniest improvs I have ever seen in radio or even stage.  Wow.  Get on him.  Well, yes.  Who cares now after hearing that?  But what I was going to say, I went to the Knick game on Sunday.  I had an all-access pass through NBC, and I got to meet all the guys. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, wow.  And before the game, Marv Albert comes out.  I get to shake his hand and just say hi.  No big deal.  But I noticed he had sideburns.  Yes.  Like long, almost 70s-like sideburns.  Like, wow, Marv's sporting a new look, okay?  The strange thing, and we've got to get to the bottom of this somehow.  Game time, he comes back out.  He went, you know, went into the locker room or whatever.  Comes back out.  No sideburns.  I'm wondering if he has a hair piece with sideburns.  A spectacular piece. 
[02:55:00]  A friendly piece that lets me walk the streets of New York.  Right.  Without being completely...  I'm thinking he has a hair helmet with the sideburns.  You're thinking the sideburns are built into one of his wigs?  Why sideburns, no sideburns within an hour?  And he wears...  Poor Nicky.  He wears that.  Well, what would have been more amazing is no sideburns.  And then sideburns.  Yeah, then they would have been confirmed.  You're right.  Right.  But having the sideburns and then not having them.  Maybe he was just sick of the sideburns and shaving.  Yeah, you're right.  They could shave them off.  The Madison Square Garden Green Room. 
[02:55:30]  A great place to groom.  Yeah, you would think maybe he would do that at home.  One of the finest.  I just found it a little odd.  That's all.  Sideburns, no sideburns within an hour.  Yes.  I really wish I had an answer for you.  But unfortunately, the time is almost up.  Are we still doing what I learned today?  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  We're totally out of time.  By the way, Mary Kay and Ashley Olsen say hello. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  They're getting hot.  It's better when it comes from someone else.  Jay, what's up?  I learned Ant likes to stay medium rare.  Yeah.  Under some station called K-Rock.  All right.  And that's what he does now.  And finally, Savage.  Yo, boss.  Yo.  I learned that it's about 20 hours to the greatest radio of all time.  Yes.  Musical dildo chairs.  For a trip to WrestleMania tomorrow on the O&A show.  I'm going to go listen to me call Anthony a homo. 
[02:56:30]  Okay.  Homo.  Hey, can we get a few more girls down last minute?  Yeah.  If they want to call up, we've got a couple seats available that girls are canceled.  Oh, seats.  Very funny.  We have a couple seats available for tomorrow's festivity.  A miracle.  Yes.  Oh, way back at that.  You've got to call the show immediately tomorrow.  Actually, they can call right now.  Call right now?  Yep.  All right.  Rick from downtown with that one.  Yes.  I'm now doing cheesy from downtown. 
[02:57:00]  Cheesy.  Setups for the impressions.  All right.  We've got to go.  Frank Caliendo, thank you very, very much.  Seriously.  Can I mention FrankCaliendo.com again?  No, you cannot.  Okay.  Oh.  I'm kidding.  Who would mention FrankCaliendo.com?  Last time I...  But they don't know how to spell Caliendo?  C-A-L-I-N-D-E-A.  See, last time I did it, last time I sit around here, because it's always great, I had, I think  I had 700 hits in like two hours from your listeners. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, we're very, very interactive listeners here.  Yeah.  That's the reason I came back.  They're all sitting right in front of me.  Wait a second.  How do you spell Caliendo again?  C-A-L-I-E-N-D-O.  D as in dog.  Do you have a message board or anything so they could leave serious comments?  No.  No, because God, would that be terrible.  Yeah.  They would leave just serious inquiries.  Maybe club dates or any recorded material.  If you guys ever looked at it, it's kind of wacky.  It's okay if you haven't.  I don't care.  No. 
[02:58:00]  It's my brother did it.  It's actually funny.  Yeah.  Tell them to put a little message thing on there so people can leave their thoughts about it.  I've actually read messages on someone before about me and I don't want to ever see them.  Suck Big C.  Yeah.  Does Marv Albert sound like J-1-0?  No.  No.  No.  That was great.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 if you want in on the musical dildo chair game for tomorrow.  Frank Caliendo.  Very important.  We highly recommend you go see them at Bananas and Hasbrook Heights tomorrow and Saturday 
[02:58:30]  night, two shows, 8 and 1045.  The phone number if you want tickets in advance, 201-727-1090, okay?  Frank, thank you.  Thank you guys for having me.  Come back and see us soon, all right?  Frank Caliendo.  I know I'm a loser.  And entity.  I can't get a city of my life to turn it on.  The Opie and entity show.  Isn't that radio stuff wacky?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  1027.
