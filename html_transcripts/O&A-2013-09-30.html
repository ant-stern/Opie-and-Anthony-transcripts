<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with the hosts' self-deprecating humor about their controversial reputation. Opie detailed his allergy struggles, while Anthony clarified a misunderstanding about a recent dental procedure.  This segued into a discussion of *Breaking Bad*'s finale, complete with spoilers and critiques of the Daily News' premature reporting, drawing comparisons to *The Sopranos* and *Dexter*.  The hosts then reviewed other films and TV shows, including *The Wire*, *Gravity* (praising the special effects and Sandra Bullock's performance, and speculating about George Clooney as a guest), *This Is the End*, *50 First Dates*, and *The Purge*, offering their opinions on plots and casting.  The discussion moved to New York City street performers, their aggressive money-soliciting tactics, and CD scams, before concluding with anecdotes about Opie's kitten's biting habits and a listener call recalling the show's past spoiler stunt regarding *Marley & Me*,  and another referencing a Harry Potter drive-by spoiler stunt.

The show continued with more discussion of Opie's kitten and a "sloppy" Naked Cowboy impersonator in Times Square.  Studio guest Roland shared his overwhelmingly positive review of *Gravity*, prompting further discussion of the film's special effects and plausibility.  The conversation then jumped to the impending government shutdown, followed by a comedic tangent about Cronuts and Dominique Ansel.  Several cold calls ensued: failed attempts to reach Barry Williams and E-Rock, and a successful call to Paul Williams confirming his upcoming studio appearance for a Muppets promotion.  The segment concluded with critiques of various commercials (Honey Nut Cheerios, Swiffer, and a Kiefer Sutherland tequila ad), a discussion of the Yankees' playoff game, George Brett's baseball career, and a comparison between iPhones and Samsung Galaxy phones, spurred by one host's recent Samsung purchase.  The segment finished with a discussion of Apple's brand ranking and the most innovative companies.

The next segment began with a discussion of Coca-Cola's falling brand ranking, transitioning to highway lane widths and the dangers of high-speed driving.  This led to a discussion of self-driving car technology, its benefits and drawbacks, and listener calls detailing the malfunctions and unexpected braking of crash warning systems.  Anecdotes about sleeping in cars, distrusting strangers (especially NYC taxi drivers), and parental discussions about children's developing bodies were also shared.  The segment concluded with Sal attempting a prank involving a supposedly severely injured man in a slingshot video, which was later revealed to be fake, sparking a debate about Sal's intentions.

A later segment focused on Sal's slingshot video prank, followed by a replay of a past interview with a misidentified Corey Worthington.  Listener-submitted Dickie Goodman/E-Rock mashups were critiqued, and the hosts dismissed news reports about Jesse Ventura and Howard Stern's potential 2016 presidential runs as publicity stunts, also discussing Seymour Hersh's claims about the Bin Laden raid.  The arrest of Dominic Barber, Anthony's ex-wife's lawyer, for allegedly choking a woman was discussed, along with a call from Colin Quinn who criticized the hosts' overly formal interviewing style with celebrity guests, and mentioned a planned "surprise" visit to Bobo's Thanksgiving.

The final segment addressed Colin Quinn's criticism, transitioning to a discussion of a viral video of a hawk stealing a released baby bunny, questioning its authenticity.  The show then transitioned into "Jocktober," with Sam Roberts detailing the challenges of finding and preparing daily content, and the potential backlash from targeted shows.  Listeners called in to suggest bad radio shows for "Jocktober," engaging in banter with the hosts.  Sal recounted his slingshot video prank, revealing his awareness of its fakeness and the hosts' knowledge of it.  The conversation revisited past "Jocktober" segments, including one targeting Opie and Anthony fans.  The show concluded with further "Jocktober" discussion, listener calls, a brief digression about *Hogan's Heroes*, and a final mention of the impending government shutdown.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's O.P. and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  O.P. and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:01:00]  O.P. and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:01:30]  O.P. and Anthony show starts now.  O.P. and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:02:00]  O.P. and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:02:30]  O.P. and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:03:00]  The out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans. 
[00:03:30]  At the controls, O.P. is the father.  Oh, this is perfect.  This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me!  I worked here!  I'm glad I got that one out.  Are we on live now?  Is it happening?  This is it?  The three men make up the O.P. and Anthony show, a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment and having very few limits.  I like where this is going.  I'm seeing a lot of options here. 
[00:04:00]  This is different than any other radio.  No telling what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's just not like radio.  It's just like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why.  This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people.  Real excitement. 
[00:04:30]  This is the O.P. and Anthony show.  Yeah, good morning, everyone.  Hi, everybody.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony show.  How's everyone doing?  I feel like shit.  I just want to tell you right off the bat.  What happened?  It was a beautiful weekend in New York City, right?  It was.  I want to know that.  Nice weather.  Because I get seasonal allergies.  Oh, are you a seasonal allergy sufferer?  I get seasonal allergies.  Oh, God, that's the tiniest, crappiest sounding fucking mic I've ever, ever had. 
[00:05:00]  Do you hear it?  It's like, oh, Christ.  Mine doesn't sound much better, but I just.  Who's fucking with stuff?  I just assumed it was my voice.  Nah.  What are you going to do?  I don't even care.  Scratchy throat.  Yeah, you got that.  Heavy chest.  Fucking.  Fucking clogged nose.  And then I don't know if it's a cold.  I don't know if it's like an early flu. 
[00:05:30]  I don't know if it's seasonal allergies because I guess they're all the same symptoms.  I just assumed I got sick every year at the exact same time.  And then finally someone said, hey, stupid.  If it's happening the exact same time every year, it's probably seasonal allergies.  Seasonal allergies.  Right.  And then I don't know what fucking combination of things to take.  Is it grass or is it elm?  I don't know what the fuck.  Is it ragweed?  I don't know.  Whatever fucking.  Whatever happens when those stupid leaves go from green to fucking brown. 
[00:06:00]  They throw something off.  Yeah, they throw a little dust off or something.  I don't know.  Yeah.  It's not pollen, obviously, right?  Pollen's in the spring.  I don't even know.  So, fuck.  And then I don't know what to take.  And I drive Dr. Steve crazy because.  Ah.  You know, you can take two different things because they do different things, but they seem like  they do the exact same thing.  Really?  Does that make sense?  No.  Someone tried to explain that to me.  Like what? 
[00:06:30]  Like, uh, like Benadryl and something else?  Like, uh, Singulair.  Singular.  Singulair.  And then, like, kind of a prescription like Zizol.  Zizol?  And you would assume they do the exact same thing, but they don't do the exact same thing.  No.  I don't fucking know.  It's so annoying.  It's annoying.  It's annoying.  I had my in-laws up from Philly yesterday, just sat around like a lump on the log.  Or lump on a log, right? 
[00:07:00]  A lump.  And it was a beautiful day to, you know, wander around.  It certainly was.  Actually, we got a little pool time in this weekend.  Really?  Crazy.  But fall is dangerous to me and my little, my little body.  Fall.  The season of fall is dangerous.  Too many allergies.  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  If it was another time, fall would take me out.  Yeah.  I would just be dead from fall.  Oh, man.  Whatever. 
[00:07:30]  I feel a little better, though.  I woke up like there's no fucking way I'm coming in today.  But I figured, you know, with you and nine missing teeth, I needed to be here to help you out.  Oh, my God.  I needed to help you out.  Oh, my.  So I'm here for you in your time of need.  I had to feel so many fucking, not only just dumb Twitter fucking people.  What do you mean dumb Twitter?  You had nine teeth pulled and people were very concerned.  Yeah, yeah.  Nine teeth.  Nine teeth.  They were very concerned.  That would be insane.  Why? 
[00:08:00]  Why would that be insane?  That's a lot of fucking teeth.  I know.  Who has nine teeth pulled?  You would have had to have, like, really fucked up.  Uh, with, with your fucking oral hygiene to, uh, have to have nine teeth pulled.  I was fielding, um...  Oh, wait.  Let's slow down.  How do you fuck up that bad that he had nine teeth pulled?  I think it's one of the...  I think it's those people that just have, like, like, crack, crack teeth.  And, like, like, Voss.  Like, Voss's teeth before he got them done.  Yeah.  You have to look like that before they pull your fucking teeth out. 
[00:08:30]  Just start yanking them.  In this day and age, they don't really pull teeth.  They pull wisdom teeth.  But, uh, they do...  Oh, God.  They really try to save, uh, you know, the teeth.  Why?  These days.  I don't know.  It's just the technology's there to do it.  Mm-hmm.  Why fucking yank teeth out and put false teeth in...  Right.  ...someone's head?  Um, no, it was like wisdom teeth.  Those get pulled.  True.  And, uh...  Not mine.  Mine came in fucking perfect, man.  Oh, man. 
[00:09:00]  Straight as a fucking arrow.  That rules.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, perfect.  I love the people that they come in sideways.  A little sideways.  A little...  Fucking going up into their nasal passage.  An impacted wisdom tooth or...  They have to cut open their ear to remove wisdom teeth.  It's like, how do they go so awry?  I understand they come in a little crooked, but...  Yeah.  Some of these people, they come in sideways.  What the fuck?  And then, and then I had to field, uh, questions from people that I know. 
[00:09:30]  Like, like, and family members and, and friends.  They were texting me going, oh, I heard the, the show, uh, hope you're okay if you need  any...  Well, when you get nine...  What the fuck?  When you get nine teeth pulled...  I didn't have nine teeth pulled!  When you get nine teeth pulled, it's okay.  Holy shit.  We'll all live with it.  You learn who really cares about you.  I did not have, and for the record...  Yes.  I did not have nine teeth pulled.  How do you know?  That's insane.  How do you know?  I know, because I, look...  I have choppers. 
[00:10:00]  I have real teeth in my head.  You're using the rest of your teeth.  The same teeth I've had.  You're using the rest of your teeth pretty well.  That's good.  No.  I've had...  It's the same teeth I've had.  Prove it.  Prove it?  Prove it.  I have to go back next Tuesday.  Yeah.  And get a crown, three crowns put on.  And then I think...  Wait, so you gotta get another three teeth pulled?  No, they have the, um...  They have the temporary on there right now.  Ah.  And then they pull that off, and then they pop on the three crowns, and then there's 
[00:10:30]  a bridge in here from, like, 19...  No, 1992.  Wow.  Or something.  And, uh...  They're gonna put a new one in.  Why?  That replaces, like, one tooth.  Why?  The old bridges do well.  I know.  I'm figuring what the fuck.  Oh.  And then...  Laminates.  False teeth.  That's what...  They're not false teeth.  The false teeth.  They're individual teeth placed artistically in the direction of your teeth cut.  How false are they gonna look? 
[00:11:00]  Not at all.  Yeah?  They're gonna look just like my regular teeth.  Except...  They're gonna be a few shades lighter and a different color, because I had discoloration  when I had to take tetracycline from my zit face when I was a kid.  So I took the tetracycline, and it discolors your teeth.  I don't like that at all.  They didn't know that shit back then?  No!  Oh, way to go.  They just give you fucking shit.  Way to fucking go, man.  Hence thalidomide babies.  Right.  You know?  They just fucking toss that shit down the old broad throats. 
[00:11:30]  Little flipper-footed people come out.  Are you guys over your dumb TV show obsession?  Oh, my God.  Finally?  Oh, my God.  Walter White's dead.  Jesse gets away.  Hey, uh, who got the ricin?  What's her name?  Uh, the chick from the car dealership.  Yeah, Lydia.  Lydia got the ricin.  Why are you, uh...  In this day and age, you can't hold back spoilers.  Too late.  Sorry.  It's the last one.  Go fuck yourself.  Well, my first...  Nazis are all daddy. 
[00:12:00]  Puts a machine gun thing in the trunk and kills them all.  And Todd has a terrible ringtone for Lydia.  Todd has a horrible ringtone.  That was one of my favorite ones.  And you hear it after Jesse takes his fucking shackles and strangles him to death and on  the floor of the Nazi place.  Well, I...  My first fuck you is to the Daily News.  They couldn't help themselves.  Like, there are people...  There are people that haven't seen the final episode of Breaking Bad for whatever reason.  Well, now you don't have to.  For whatever reason.  Yeah, but...  Final shot pan out from dead Walter White laying on the floor. 
[00:12:30]  Eyes open.  Yeah, I know that.  Like lost, but better.  Because the Daily News has the picture.  Oh, it does?  And I'm one of these assholes that have just decided that I'm going to watch Breaking Bad.  Yeah.  I'm like, you know what?  I'm going to just watch Breaking Bad.  But stupid Daily News couldn't fucking help themselves.  They had to put it right on the front page that Walter White is dead.  And then they have the last shot of the show.  There he is, right?  That's how the show ended?  That was it.  With him laying there with his eyes open dead?  Laying there.  See, I now know that. 
[00:13:00]  Pull away from his dead face.  He's pretty satisfied, though, at that point.  I think his end.  He was done.  He was finally done.  He did everything he needed to do.  What journey song did they use?  Don't Stop Believin'.  They went with Don't Stop Believin' as well.  Yeah, yeah.  That's kind of dumb.  Oh, actually, I'm sorry.  No, it was Wheel in the Sky.  Oh, they went Wheel in the Sky.  Wheel in the Sky.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.  They didn't go with a song? 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, they did.  They went with...  Any song we know?  What was it?  Baby Blue?  Is that what it was called?  Bad Finger Baby Blue.  Really?  Yeah.  It was good.  I'm a fan of the Bad Finger.  Now, picture a spinning, kind of slow camera thing, pulling away from a straight-down look  of Walter White laying there, prone on his back on the floor, with a kind of satisfied  look on his face.  He's dead, but, you know, he did everything he needed to do. 
[00:14:00]  Hooked his family up with some money.  Yeah, he figured it all out.  Figured it all out.  Killed all the bad people.  It couldn't have been more fulfilling.  And Jesse's fucking driving away at 100 miles an hour, fucking woo-hooing.  Jesse's totally going to jail.  He's so going to jail.  Well, you don't know.  Doesn't everyone know?  Like, it's like Jesse Pinkman.  Fucking Hank's wife knows about Jesse Pinkman.  I think she's the only one that knows, though.  The two DA agents that were working with him are dead.  Yeah, but she knows. 
[00:14:30]  Exactly.  She's the only one that knows.  And Skyler.  Skyler knows.  Skyler's not talking.  She's gonna sit there chain-smoking him.  What about Flynn?  That fucking idiot.  I know Dirty Pinkman.  He works with Dad.  And how great is it that right till the end of that whole series, Flynn is still completely  oblivious to what's happening around him.  What adult.  Thank God we didn't have to hear word one out of his dumb mouth.  We just saw him hobble off a school bus.  All I wanted was a hit and run when he got off the school bus. 
[00:15:00]  Mow him down when he got off the bus.  Exactly.  Exactly.  What are you still alive, right?  Dad, you killed Hank or Hank.  I don't know what you're talking about.  I know.  I know.  It's like listening to fucking French.  I have no idea what's going on.  But I was gonna start watching.  Well, you know what?  By the time you get to the last episode...  I might forget.  You won't forget that Walt's dead, but you'll forget all that other shit. 
[00:15:30]  Plus you knew.  I mean, when you go into that last scene knowing Walt's dead, there's so many ways for him  to possibly die.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That doesn't even...  No, exactly.  It wouldn't have spoiled it if you knew 15 minutes before it ends.  What everyone just assumed he was gonna be dead, right?  Yeah, everyone knew he was gonna die.  It was just a matter of how it was gonna go down.  What was gonna happen and what he was gonna do before he died to kind of wrap things up.  Are you guys satisfied with the finale?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's tough to make everyone happy with the finale of a show. 
[00:16:00]  Remember The Sopranos?  Yep.  I would say the majority of the people did not like the final episode of The Sopranos.  And you had to kind of sit with it for a while.  And then I think it turned a lot of people around as time went by.  It's a very difficult situation.  But you guys are pretty happy with the final episode?  Final episodes are very weird because you could...  If it isn't so insanely crazy, you get pissed off.  And if it completely ties everything up, wraps everything up, and leaves the end like a book or something, 
[00:16:30]  then people are pissed also.  Because it's like, oh, you know, that's it?  So you're never gonna make everybody happy.  But I think they did a great job.  They really shit the bed so bad that it makes you regret ever watching a show.  Dexter?  Dexter.  I heard Dexter was a horrendous one.  What happened at the end of Dexter?  He...  His sister died.  And he faked his own death and ended up in a log cabin in Oregon.  It was so bad. 
[00:17:00]  That sounds like fucking...  That's kind of cool.  It sounds like the two episode...  Like, it sounds like the mid-season of Breaking Bad.  Yeah, yeah.  Terrible.  I've never watched a worse final season.  A lot of people said they hated the Dexter finale.  I don't know anyone who would like it.  That song, by the way, Baby Blue, number 52 on iTunes right now.  I don't go to number one.  Oh, my God.  Moving up the charts.  Can you imagine they'd ended that series with Walter White in New Hampshire?  That sounds like...  I know.  That would have just...  That's basically how Dexter ended. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, ended with him up there.  Like, okay, well, whatever.  I thought it was going to end with him in Witness Protection, and he's now Malcolm from Malcolm  LeMille.  Oh, boy.  We get it.  How many of those tweets say, wouldn't it be...  No!  It'd be great.  I bet.  I bet.  No.  I bet.  No.  Tell you, though, could have used a little more Robert Forster.  Yeah.  Uh, that's the guy that hooked him up?  Yeah. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, that guy moved him.  That guy was cool.  Yeah, what an awesome character that gets to know, like, for a couple of scenes in the  second to last time.  I know, right?  I know, right?  He said that he wrote that character based on Robert Forster's character in Jackie Brown.  Right.  And then they asked him if he could do it, and he said yes.  What was he in years ago?  Jackie Brown.  I know, but he was in something else.  He's been in a lot of stuff.  I think that was, like, kind of a big show, I think, or something.  I don't know.  It was pretty good, though. 
[00:18:30]  I liked it.  What's Mars doing?  You watch Breaking Bad?  What are you doing in here?  What's going on?  I'm just, uh, paying attention to Jimmy's audio, I mean, Anthony's audio.  Your mic is fine.  Oh.  The headphones were out.  They were out, and they were loud.  That's what it...  What happened?  What happened?  Someone else's headphones were out?  No, no, no, no.  Jimmy's headphones were out, and I thought he was still coming.  Oh, so it was going through there.  Oh. 
[00:19:00]  And I had Jimmy's mic on.  Oh.  Out of habit.  That's why.  All right.  Much better now, though.  He was in Heroes.  That's better.  He was in Heroes.  Right.  Right you are.  Okay.  Did you watch Breaking Bad Mars?  No.  Unfortunately, I used to watch Dexter, and the ending sucked horribly.  Not the finale.  Horribly.  Yeah.  But Breaking Bad is the show to watch, I guess.  That's, uh...  Or it's over.  Well, now it's done, Ski.  Yeah.  But, uh...  I got... 
[00:19:30]  I started watching The Wire late.  I'll be good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'll be good.  Yeah, I didn't watch The Wire when it was on at all.  I had to pick it up.  And from doing this show and having guests from The Wire on this show...  Like, there were a fuckload of spoilers.  Yeah.  But as I watched it, it was still okay.  Like, I didn't remember, or I didn't know when it was gonna happen, or...  You know, you don't know.  So fuck you with the spoilers.  And there's gotta be some statute of fucking limitations.  And for me, it was the next fucking morning for the final episode. 
[00:20:00]  That's why I gave out the whole thing.  I'm not gonna sit here and be hostage to people that haven't seen the goddamn show!  I think for a show like this, where it was like...  It was a cultural event, almost.  Like, you could not escape Breaking Bad talk over the weekend.  I think it's okay to talk about it the next day.  Yeah.  You know?  Because this is the biggest finale by far since The Sopranos.  And when The Sopranos ended, it was like...  Sopranos?  Sopranos?  It's like, of course you're gonna talk about it.  No, he's got it.  It's Sopranos. 
[00:20:30]  Sopranos.  Sopranos.  Yeah.  It's like, of course you're gonna talk about how the show ended.  Like, that's all you were talking about.  But now everybody DVRs and Netflixes.  That's just it.  Yeah.  Right.  So they think they have this God-given right to not have their show spoiled, when the fact  of the matter is, it's more your job not to get it spoiled than it is for me not to  spoil it.  That's it.  Don't get too cocky, because I got a spoiler too, man.  I could fucking throw right at you.  Love Boat?  I could spoil the shit out of something. 
[00:21:00]  What?  Uh-oh.  Don't tempt me.  What's he got?  I'm gonna tempt you.  Tempt!  Tempt!  Really?  I don't know.  What is it?  I don't know where I'm at with spoilers these days.  I know.  It sucks when it happens to you.  I understand.  I do have a spoiler.  Yeah?  Yes.  It's a biggie. 
[00:21:30]  Uh-oh.  In this day and age, though, you can't keep them back.  How do you do that?  You can't.  Because no one could stay off their Twitter for, you know, more than 10 seconds.  That's true.  So you get fucked that way.  Yep.  You turn on your stupid TV, and there's some kind of scrawl giving a spoiler away.  Yep.  Because people can't help themselves.  They just have to get that info out.  No, they have to tell you.  Spoiler used to mean to spoil it before it becomes public information.  It was never this thing of after it airs.  Dude.  Right.  But everyone's promoting how you can watch your shit on demand, so you can't, you know. 
[00:22:00]  So you just can never talk about anything?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what it's gone down to.  You can't talk about anything now.  I've also learned.  They've promoted this on demand to the point that, like, oh, okay, I'm going to watch my  shit on demand.  Everyone just stands around the water cooler going, oh, oh.  You saw it, right?  Huh?  Oh, did you say, oh, no, don't say it.  Water cooler talk.  Oh.  Blah.  Blah.  Oh, Bill hasn't seen it.  Yeah, but it was good.  I've learned not to mention whatever I'm watching on Twitter unless I'm done with it. 
[00:22:30]  I'll tell you.  Yeah.  You know, like, there's plenty of series that I haven't even watched yet, and I'm not,  I don't say.  Why would you mention it?  Don't say, oh, I'm just starting up Breaking Bad because you know there's going to be an  asshole that's going to be like, oh, there's going to be those at the end.  Correctamundo.  Well, speaking of spoilers, you'd think The Sixth Sense would be as successful today.  Oh, man.  Because that was before social, you know, networking, obviously.  You'd fucking log on, and it would be, he's been dead the whole movie.  Look, man, I was able to see the movie before someone spoiled it for me, and I don't think  I went opening weekend. 
[00:23:00]  No.  You know?  But that, you couldn't hold that info back nowadays, and would that affect the movie?  Right.  Because when that shit went down, you're like, you were blown away.  Yeah.  If you were one of the lucky ones to know, not know, I guess, that Bruce Willis was dead  the entire movie.  Spoiler.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So how do they do that nowadays?  Because that element of surprise is awesome in movies and TV shows.  It certainly is.  When it hits you, you're like, holy fuck.  But people these days, oh, boy. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, I got a spoiler.  What is it?  What?  What does it entail?  What show?  I just got a little power today.  Don't fuck with me.  I'll spoil the shit out of something.  What media?  If it's a book, it's probably not as big a deal.  A book?  What the hell are those?  I'm going to keep it very vague, unless there's some misbehaving in the studio today.  Oh, my gosh.  I'm going to fuck you all up.  I'm slaying them.  That is a lot of pressure.  Be nice.  I got seasonal allergies. 
[00:24:00]  I think my Jets have seasonal allergies.  Oh, what happened?  They shit the bed?  Yeah, they took a beating yesterday.  And the Giants, who I'm not a fan of, they're 0-4, which makes me very happy.  Jimmy Johnson already put a fork in the Giants.  Said that's it, huh?  Yeah, he did before the game yesterday.  Spoiler.  Oh, yeah.  He's like, it's the fourth week.  And he was like, no, they're finished for the season.  They're done.  They only play 16 games.  It's very rare to come back from 0-4.  Yeah. 
[00:24:30]  They're done.  Why fucking even play the rest of the season?  And the Jets are on the cusp of being done at 2-2.  There was some high school football team that put out a video because one of the announcers,  maybe it was Strahan, said the Giants are playing like a high school football team.  And one of the good high school football teams put out a video about how disrespectful it was to them.  Of course.  Because they actually want to win games.  So why doesn't the high school football team make fun of his lisp?  That giant fucking gap. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, there's a lot of air passing through those two.  His twofuses.  If you have a lisp like that, you can't make fun of anything.  Because then they can make fun of that.  Yeah.  True.  Yeah.  Football sucks this year for me.  Fuck!  Why?  Because the New York teams stink on ice?  We got Geno Smith.  He's an all-right quarterback.  So we got to give him his time.  I like the Broncos, though, man.  I might be a huge Manning fan in another week or two.  Are you going to bleed Bronco orange?  Fuck yeah.  They're 4-0 and looking really good. 
[00:25:30]  And Peyton Manning, it's the best start of his career, believe it or not.  Even though, like, he had his neck rebuilt or whatever the fuck happened.  Bionic neck.  And he's having a hell of a season already, and they're 4-0.  Imagine if Peyton Manning gets a Super Bowl with another team like that.  That would be pretty cool.  Is that, like, crazy?  I think it's pretty crazy.  That would be crazy if that happened?  Yeah.  Who's your team this year?  I'm going to go with the Buffalo.  The Bills?  Yeah, I'm going with the Bills.  They finally, it's their year.  They had a nice win yesterday. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's a New York team, technically.  I like the Bills as well.  More Canadian football league, but.  For my 10 years in Western New York, I still take a peek at the Bills.  They did all right yesterday, man.  Yeah, I'm going with Buffalo this year.  Beat the fucking Ravens, man.  Are the Ravens good this year, Travis?  I don't even know.  They're okay.  They're just okay, huh?  They lost a lot of guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They lost to the Bills.  They lost to Anthony's team.  Like the Nazis in Breaking Bad?  Yes, they lost a lot of guys.  They lost a lot of guys? 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  After Walt mowed them all down with a machine gun?  Oh, my God.  In his trunk?  Yeah, but spoiler.  The one dude was still twitching.  He was twitching.  I'm like, what's...  That's a no loose ends.  No.  That was so funny.  Look, I hid the money.  You're not going to...  You won't find it if...  And they did the old blood splatter on the camera lens trick?  Yes.  I love that.  So cool.  That's great.  Why didn't Bryan Cranston ever come back on our show?  The show got too popular?  Huge show. 
[00:27:00]  He didn't come to New York for a press.  Nobody came back.  He had a good time on our show.  It's not a big market.  He just hasn't been...  He did LA Press.  He doesn't have to promote that show.  You know what I want to know?  That show.  What happened to Huell?  He's just sitting in that safe house.  What happened to Huell?  Huell, the big, fat, black guy.  The big, fat guy.  And what happened to...  He's just sitting in that safe house.  Where's Bill Burr?  Bill Burr's fine, but they told Huell to stay put while they go fix everything.  He's just going to stay there.  And then he died.  You know he ain't moving.  No.  He was scared.  He was scared.  He doesn't know that everybody's dead except for the guy he thinks is dead, which is Bill Burr. 
[00:27:30]  He's just sitting there.  And there's 70 million bucks somewhere.  I don't know where it is.  Oh.  Did we ever play the Harry Potter video where the guy drives by the movie theater  and spoils it?  Oh, yeah.  We did that when it came out.  Yeah, okay.  Someone just tweeted that to me.  Spurlers.  Did you find that?  Spurler.  That is hilarious.  One of my favorite Opie and Anthony moments from before I was here.  Oh, we certainly did it as well.  Yeah.  Was Earl going down. 
[00:28:00]  They're throwing pens at the van.  Yeah, we might have spoiled the Harry Potter movie back in the day.  Yeah, yeah.  And our van got attacked.  Yeah, I thought we did this too, but another guy did a drive-by.  Yeah, it's the second one down.  A drive-by.  This one?  Yes.  Speaking of spoilers.  I'm here at the Barnes & Noble, and you can't see it from here,  but there's a giant crowd outside.  And I am about to ruin the Harry Potter ending for them. 
[00:28:30]  It is 1.02 a.m. Central Time.  This is Dallas, Texas.  Let's see how pissed off these people get.  He's a little nervous.  He is.  He is.  He's swallowing.  He's not...  Is he in his car?  Yeah.  He's doing a drive-by.  Oh, I see. 
[00:29:00]  It's a very slow drive-by.  And I suck at driving.  This was a couple years before cameras were awesome, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You could tell he's having some trouble.  And I have a friend up there that's probably never going to forgive me for doing this, but oh well.  He needs a good editor.  He does.  This is all garbage.  Covering room floor.  Here he goes.  He's on the move. 
[00:29:30]  Where are the people?  Oh, yeah.  Where's the huge crowd?  Yeah, right?  What's he talking about?  What's he doing?  Snape kills Dumbledore!  We did it way better.  That's it?  Yeah, we did it way better. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, that was terrible.  Sorry for wasting your time.  But that's an actual spoiler because the book wasn't out yet.  Well, that's a spoiler, right?  It wasn't like people are just sitting there like, oh, read the book when I get around to it.  Yeah, don't spoil it.  Don't spoil it.  Don't, don't, don't spoil.  Those Harry Potter people were.  Yeah, they were a little nutty.  A little nutty, right?  A little nutty.  Let me say hi to Tom on Long Island.  Tom!  Hey, what's up, boys?  What's up?  About seven years ago, you saved my aunt from having to go see Marley and me by spoiling that,  and I greatly appreciate it because I love little dogs, and I'd have to watch that one die. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, right.  Yeah, they fucking killed off the dog, right?  I never saw that movie.  I wouldn't watch that.  Like, why do you want to put yourself through that?  I have no idea.  For a dumb movie.  Dogs dying are brutal.  Horrible.  That's just brutal shit.  Yeah.  Fuck that noise, yo.  You get to see it when it's a puppy, and then a dog, and then all that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're literally getting attached to the dog in the movie, like a condensed version of if 
[00:31:00]  you really owned it, and then they kill it at the end.  Right.  Fuck you.  Yeah.  I don't need that kind of fucking misery.  I'm looking for punishment.  I got the call over the weekend, and I was lucky enough to see Gravity, one of the first screenings  of Gravity with George Clooney and Sandra Bullock.  Right.  I think there's like four people in the entire movie.  Yeah.  And fuck, was that awesome.  Good one?  Yeah.  I really liked it.  Yeah, it's 90 minutes of just action.  I gotta see that.  Is that the spoiler? 
[00:31:30]  Huh?  Is that the spoiler?  That's a spoiler.  Oh, no, that would be too obvious.  Stop it.  They're in space.  Spoiler.  Yeah.  Yeah, it looks pretty good.  They got that special effects shit down when they put people in space in movies.  I saw the 3D version.  Holy fuck, man.  It was terrific.  IMAX?  I think it was just regular 3D.  Regular 3D?  What do they do on 42nd Street?  Regular 3D?  I don't know.  They don't got that IMAX down there, right?  No, no.  I think they got that.  The screen was really big, so I'm not sure.  Yeah.  But there's a difference, right? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm just fucking around.  No, it wasn't in IMAX.  I can imagine in IMAX it would be even better.  Yeah.  I can't see this movie doing well if you're not seeing it in 3D or IMAX, though, because  you need that shit.  Yeah.  Because you're up there in space.  Space.  The opening shot is just beautiful.  Absolutely beautiful.  I was telling you about it.  Yeah.  You're kind of seeing space from, I guess, the space station.  I mean, seeing Earth from the space station.  And you're just looking at Earth and that, you know, that fucking just blue, marbly thing. 
[00:32:30]  And it's all just beautiful.  And then it catches your eye that there's this little dot to the right that's slowly but surely getting a little bigger.  And then, you know, your attention is drawn to that, obviously.  And eventually it's the opening shot where it's the space shuttle with George Clooney outside the space shuttle doing a spacewalk untethered.  Oh.  But it just shows you how vast the space is. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, and how tiny.  I don't know how the fuck they shot that movie.  They do a lot of underwater shit because they were spinning the whole movie.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Nausiating.  Because someone asked me to, you know, give a little clue about the movie.  So I told them.  It's a lot of spinning and a lot of suspense.  Do they, do they, is it nauseating, like, to watch?  Not at all.  Would people get sick that, like, normally, like, oh, I couldn't take the shaky camera in that. 
[00:33:30]  No.  In that stupid Cloverfield.  Cloverfield.  Or what was the first one with the shaky camera?  Blair Witch.  Oh, Blair Witch.  Blair Witch.  It's like, and people that see Blair Witch are saying that, by the way, everybody in  Blair Witch dies at the end.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck.  They go in, they see the little fucking kid handprints and.  Right.  Become witches.  Face the wall.  But the thing with Cloverfield, because we're obsessed about that movie from time to time.  Didn't they do screenings where people were like, this, this is awful.  It's too nauseous. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  And why wouldn't they, you know, fix that just slightly?  They're like, ah, who cares?  Because the movie itself was a good concept.  I'll, I'll, I'll stand by that.  I kind of liked the concept of the whole thing.  The shaky camera was a bit much.  It was way too much.  Yeah.  Half the movie, I'm looking down like a pussy in my fucking shoes.  You can't look.  You get all nauseated.  It was horrible.  But I like Gravity.  I think it's going to fall short of being an amazing movie.  Yeah.  But it's a really good movie, I thought.  What about the Sandra Bullock casting?  I'm not a huge Sandra Bullock fan. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Really not.  Don't like her usually.  With the girl from the bus.  Yes, but she was, she was, she was excellent.  She was absolutely excellent in this movie.  And I thought believable, you know?  Yeah?  Yeah.  Because she usually, like she, to me, puts a movie in another category.  It's like, I can't, I can't take it seriously as a real movie.  What about Clooney floating around up there?  Clooney, a little weird, but I could at least take him seriously.  No, Clooney takes you out of it too, because I know what you're getting at. 
[00:35:00]  Clooney, I know, yeah, yeah.  When the actor is so famous, it takes you out of some of these movies, because you can't  get past the fact, no, that's George Clooney.  Yeah.  Not a veteran, you know, astronaut.  It should have just been some guy where it's like, I think I've seen this guy in a movie.  Exactly.  Right, right.  I think the, you know, somebody.  The guy from District 9.  That would be good, right?  That would be good.  It's like, oh, that's District 9 guy, but I could play, I could take him as an astronaut.  No, the whole movie I'm going, that's Clooney.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm like, oh, that's George Clooney.  George Clooney.  He's going to try to rob a casino with his famous friends any minute. 
[00:35:30]  Ocean's fucking 14.  They're trying to rob the space station.  And what's Miss Congeniality doing up there anyway?  Miss Congeniality's up there.  It's crazy.  She's fucking, the space station can't go over 50, 55,000 miles an hour.  Exactly.  Or it explodes.  She's going to adopt a big black kid in space.  Big black kid in space.  Because when I saw the preview for, you know, Gravity, I'm like, how are they going to pull  this off?  Yeah.  You see her, you see there's a problem and she floats away and like, okay, that's the 
[00:36:00]  whole movie.  There you go.  What else could they fucking do?  Goodbye.  And I want to know, like, you know, we got to wait for people to see the movie, but then  we're going to have to have a discussion.  How much of this shit is possible?  Oh, we have to get Kaku on.  Yeah, because you're going to have a whole bunch of people coming out of the woodwork  saying, look, that's not possible.  You can't do that.  That would be ridiculous.  It is, uh, actually, this could happen.  Ah!  Could you just stop him on the street and have a friendly conversation?  Yeah, why don't you do that? 
[00:36:30]  As he runs away.  One day I was very good and I was trying to introduce him to my kid.  It was just me and my kid.  Ah!  Yes, yes.  He was polite, like, ah!  And that just started walking faster.  I'm like, I want to go, I want to say, hey, that's really insulting.  Yeah, what are you doing?  I'm not going to hurt you.  You can just walk away, but you don't have to, like, start walking faster.  Jesus.  Some people would find that very insulting.  Ah, he's a nervous Nelly.  A little scientist guy. 
[00:37:00]  What do you expect?  I'll tell you this, this Gravity got a great review and I'll tell you why.  I went with Roland.  Oh, boy.  Roland wrote me.  He's like, you want to go see Gravity?  It's going to be a big fucking movie.  I'm going to see Gravity.  They're talking Oscar.  He's saying they're talking Oscar.  He says that about every movie.  Yeah, he was sure that Hugh Jackman was going to get the Oscar for Les Mis over.  Oscar not.  Well, I mean, you've got to give, like, Gravity all the special effects awards.  Well, yeah.  You have to.  I can't even imagine.  I mean, not all the movies are out, obviously.  Yeah.  But I can't see anyone beating that shit. 
[00:37:30]  So I think they do walk away with some Oscars.  Uh-huh.  And I go, Roland, I'm going with you if you don't fall asleep.  You've got to promise me you're not going to fall asleep because I can't do it anymore.  Of course he's going to fall asleep.  Because people get so mad.  Because he snores really loud.  He's very loud, yes.  And I'm like, I can't do this anymore with you.  Because I promise, you know, I forgot what he did.  He mumbled something like, I don't know, sugar, fucking coffee, something. 
[00:38:00]  I don't know.  I'm here to say that Roland stayed awake the entire movie.  Wow.  That's your good review right there.  That is a good review right there.  That's your good review right there.  That should be in the commercial.  Yes.  Where it's like Rolling Stone says, amazing, that Roland stayed awake.  He stayed awake.  Yeah.  Through the entire fucking movie.  Nice.  It's going to be a hot Oscar season.  Because he also stayed awake during the whole movie of Prisoners.  Oh.  The Hugh Jackman movie.  Yes.  Really?  Which leads me to believe that both those pictures will be nominated for Best Picture. 
[00:38:30]  He does like his Hugh Jackman.  Roland stays awake.  I think that's a good omen for Oscar season.  Yeah.  And then I lost $100 because he stayed awake for that other thing.  What was that?  I already forgot.  Oh, right.  I bet him.  It was Star Trek, wasn't it?  No, I didn't see Star Trek yet.  But you bet him, and I had to tell you whether he fell asleep or not.  Oh, right.  I think it was Star Trek.  Was it Star Trek?  It was 3D, IMAX.  You couldn't fall asleep.  It was amazing.  Plus, he was just pinching himself the whole time to try to win the bet. 
[00:39:00]  That doesn't count.  He won the bet.  Yeah.  So Gravity was, I give it a huge thumbs up.  I liked it.  Let's see that.  Like I said, I'm not a huge Sandra Bullock fan, but she was really good in it.  Take it out.  Yeah.  She was really good.  And George Clooney as George Clooney.  So weird.  As George Clooney.  She plays himself.  Yeah, I think so.  I think it was just a goof.  Like, now, so I was like, ah, let's just have George Clooney up there flowing around.  Was he gay in space?  Uh, no, he was not.  Oh, okay.  Just wondering.  Why?  I wondered if he was gay in space. 
[00:39:30]  We might.  We might get George Clooney on the show.  What?  Supposedly.  Oh, God.  Who said that?  Yeah, sure.  Well, that was one way Roland got me to see the movie.  Oh, come on.  If we take, he's like, you know, George Clooney, my face.  Could you, look, look at that door.  Let's all look at the studio door.  We've seen some famous people come through there.  Any reality.  See that door open and see Mr. George Clooney walk through there and sit down.  Hi, guys.  Roland says it's possible.  It's impossible. 
[00:40:00]  Impossible.  Look, man, there's no one in this movie.  So it's either Sandra Bullock or George Clooney.  Oh, no.  He'll be like, hey, guys, the executive producer of Gravity wants to come in.  Or they'll send, like, real astronauts out to talk about it.  Yes, yes, yes.  And then one other guy talked a little bit.  Oh, well, guess who's the press guy then?  Yeah.  The one other guy.  Other guy.  Other guy is not.  I'm not taking other guy.  Other guy.  That's who's coming in here.  Was George Clooney there?  There was three speaking roles, except for, you know, some NASA shit over the radio. 
[00:40:30]  That's what we'll get.  We'll get NASA.  Radio operator three.  We'll get NASA shit over the radio guy.  Yay, TB.  Yeah, but if you take him, you're going to get George Clooney for another project.  For the next one.  Ooh.  Yeah.  I like it.  And Adam Sandler will be with him.  Adam Sandler.  I saw that Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore movie it was on.  Which one?  50 First Dates?  I don't know.  The one where she's fucking dope every day.  Yeah, 50 First Dates. 
[00:41:00]  50 First Dates.  She's just a dope every day, and they have to, like...  Why would it matter if she figured it out?  Why do they have to get the fucking newspaper every day, the exact fucking same newspaper?  And why do they have to cover up her artwork every day?  And why do they have to watch the football game?  Oh, that's stunk.  How about they fucking tell her, look, man, you were in an accident, and your fucking  memory's all messed up.  Yeah.  But, you know, it's good you know that now, and we're going to try to figure this shit  out.  Yeah.  Plus the fact, like, if they told her, the next day she wouldn't know anyway, right? 
[00:41:30]  Right.  So just tell her.  Tell her every day.  Tell her every day.  I felt so old over the weekend.  Yeah.  His record, They're All Gonna Laugh At You, was 20 years old yesterday.  No.  Yeah.  I remember playing that nonstop.  Damn.  Wow.  Yep.  So that's probably the last time we talked to him.  We talked to him back in the day.  We used to talk to Adam Sandler before he became Adam Sandler.  Huge. 
[00:42:00]  I saw that movie Purge over the weekend.  Which one was that now?  Did we have any?  We had, yeah, we had the head guy, the lead guy.  What's his name?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You didn't like that movie?  What liberal drivel shit.  Oh, okay.  Because, of course, the bad people are the, it was the white people, the rich little white  guy and his white crony friends.  And who was the, the hero, the homeless black guy that, uh, came into the house. 
[00:42:30]  But they did throw in a, a, a rich black neighbor that was a bad person.  Yeah, married to the white guy.  She was, she was so not black.  Like, she was the, the, it was so fucking crappy.  Reverse Oreo, you mean?  Yeah, yeah.  It just stunk.  Wait, who was, who was the main guy?  Ethan Hawke.  Ethan Hawke.  It's the movie where they let.  Oh, Ethan Hawke came in.  One day a year, they, they let people go crazy. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, right, right, sure, of course.  Get some violence on.  It's already getting a sequel.  Is it?  Like, that shit's in production.  Yeah, because it made $65 million and it cost $3 million to make.  Wow.  Tell you what, I did like the daughter in that movie.  Yeah?  She was kind of hot.  Who was that?  She was a slut, too.  Her boyfriend came over.  Fucking fucker.  Yeah.  She was pretty, uh, she was pretty hot.  What's her name? 
[00:43:30]  Oh, yeah.  Look, look.  See, right?  What do you think?  Adelaide.  Wow.  Right?  She's kind of cute.  Hello there.  Yeah.  What do we got here?  Yeah, well, what have we got here?  Oh, it's Rolly.  I'm going to use my seasonal allergy voice to get something done here.  What do we got?  Rolly, what do you got here?  Rolly.  It looks like a pistol case.  What the fuck?  Uh-oh.  It is.  No, it's, uh, This is the End.  It's a survival series.  What is it?  This is the End.  Seth Rogen.  This is the End.  Oh, I thought you said, This is the End. 
[00:44:00]  Wow.  This is your boss.  Your movie.  Wizard of Oz.  Yeah.  You wanted one.  Aw.  I didn't want one.  You said, I want to see one.  You said, I want to see Wizard of Oz.  What are you, a faggot?  Well, it's in 3D now, I guess.  Is that the 3D?  Yeah.  Oh, man, I want to watch that.  Yeah, give it to Anthony.  I got, I got, I got 3D.  I could be a man.  Nine missing teeth.  I don't have nine missing teeth.  You have food in it.  Whoa, look at that.  Look at, look at this.  It's all the things from the movie.  There's a little Cinnamon Toast Crunch. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, look.  Did you guys see the movie?  Wait, do they give you a camera or is it a fake camera?  No, it's not a camera.  It's a flashlight.  It's a Milky Way.  Let me tell you something.  This is all the shit from them.  This is the End, which was, I liked that movie a lot.  Did you end up seeing it?  Yes, I did.  It's on demand, and I saw it, and I thought it was very funny.  With a little bit of, I was a little annoyed at the self-servingness of the whole thing.  What do you mean?  It's very self-congratulatory, like they're all kind of, look at us.  But they're goofing on that. 
[00:45:00]  Yes, but no.  Really?  Just to have the ability to goof on it puts it in a weird category.  I don't know.  I found it a little, like, weird that they, I don't know how to describe it.  As I was watching it, though, I'm thinking, all right, we know they're all awesome, and  they're all friends.  We get it.  It was like, they were goofing on themselves, but they knew how cool it made them to goof  on themselves. 
[00:45:30]  Thank you.  That's what I meant.  Nope.  That's what Justin Timberlake does.  Yes.  JT.  Yeah, he goes on SNL, and it's like, see, I'm just a funny guy.  Look, I'm a goofy guy.  It's like, yeah, but we can't be funny, we can't wait.  But don't goof on me.  Right.  Don't you goof on me.  Right.  Right.  What about when Danny McBride shows up?  He's great.  Is he a rock star in that movie when he shows up?  He's fucking cool as shit.  It's one of the greatest entrances, well, that's exactly it, but one of the, you know, when  he appears on screen.  Oh, yeah.  Holy fuck, what a badass.  So they put this whole kit together just to promote the fact that it's now on DVD? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, pretty much.  What else is in there?  Nutella.  It has the wind-up flashlight clock.  Cinnamon Toast Crunch.  Clock.  Got tape.  Does that work?  That's cool.  You wind it out.  Nice.  Look at that.  You wind it, and it's...  Really?  Not like...  And it does whatever.  It does whatever.  I don't know.  It's additional.  I can't do the wrong laugh today.  Fuck.  That's great.  What else is in there? 
[00:46:30]  It's got a Milky Way James Franco special food.  Yeah.  What's that thing right there?  This?  No, the white thing.  I think lotion?  Probably suntan lotion.  I'm in a lotion, so...  So you could jerk off?  Yeah.  Yeah, you could jerk off.  Wow, you're really sweaty already today.  Roland, what's up?  It's warm in the subways.  Yeah?  Yeah, it's pretty warm in there.  Do you mean, like, spiritually?  No, like, hot.  Figuratively?  It's super hot down there.  Oh, I thought people were just really nice down there.  Oh, it's warm.  It's warm in the office, too.  They don't believe in air condition. 
[00:47:00]  The bongo guys gave me a headache after the fucking Gravity movie.  Yeah, I hear that.  In the suburbs.  In the suburbs.  In the subway.  Usually I enjoy a good street musician.  Oh, boy.  I really do, actually.  Yeah.  These fucking guys with the paint cans.  It smells bad.  But it was so loud, it gave me an instant headache.  And they're holding up everyone for money.  Dude.  Their new thing is, like, they're basically saying there's a new law in New York City, they're  basically saying, without saying it, that it's like, look, you know, if you take a picture 
[00:47:30]  or video of a street musician, you need to give some money.  Get the fuck out of here.  They said it in a way where most people would think, oh, my God, it's a new law.  And it was working.  People were taking money out of their fucking pockets.  I see rubes every day, and it fucking makes me sick.  They were good, but they were so fucking loud.  Help the homeless.  Help the homeless, man.  Come here.  Hey, you big fella.  Big fella.  Come here.  Help the homeless.  That money's not going to the homeless, you fucking idiots.  Well, they rent out those tubs. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  That specific person is getting all the money that they collect.  Right.  Uh-huh.  But they make it look like they're-  You're helping the homeless.  Like you're helping everyone.  Yeah, they're collecting it for their pals.  But we all know who you're talking about.  It's a guy right outside this building a block away.  Yeah, yeah.  And he sets up, and it's such a prime time spot.  He gets there really early.  He's there when I drive through around 515, 520.  Three hours of the morning.  And he's already set up.  Yep.  And everyone gives money thinking he's helping a shelter or something. 
[00:48:30]  Help the homeless.  Help the homeless.  Travis is absolutely right.  That guy gets all that fucking money.  He gets all the money.  And then there's the-  I saw the rap artists.  Oh, yeah.  With their fucking CDs.  I love those.  And I saw some fucking poor little rube kid.  He looked like he was from the Midwest.  And the two of them were on him.  And they're handing him, and he's holding the disc.  And I just looked like, oh, you dummy.  Just leave.  What's your name?  The autograph.  Yeah, what's your name, man?  What's your name, man?  Yeah, this is all music.  You're supporting our music, man. 
[00:49:00]  What's your name, man?  Oh, Billy Joe.  And then they sign it.  Yeah.  And go, yeah, yeah, yeah.  My man.  My man.  It's a signed copy.  It's $10.  And then, of course, they get home and play it, and it's empty.  It's blank.  Usually it's blank?  Oh, yeah.  They buy fucking bulk quantities or steal bulk quantities of fucking discs.  Put them in a little sleeve with some printed out fucking artwork.  I thought there was at least music on there.  You think the scam artist is honestly giving them music?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, yeah, nah. 
[00:49:30]  They get Virgil'd.  Yeah, they get Virgil'd on that one.  And then there's the fucking, that Zamfir flute guy that plays through the amplified fucking.  That's a totally-do guy.  Dude, it's so loud.  And there's a subway thing, right?  His speakers are pointing at it.  You could go down three fucking flights of stairs, and you're still hearing, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Dude, I made a totally-do video with one of those guys.  Hate him.  The guy was really fucking annoyed, but I did it. 
[00:50:00]  He's so loud.  It was an homage to you.  Homage to me if I had fucking 20 Marshall stacks behind me.  That guy is fucking loud.  You ever see my tootally-do video?  I go right up to the guy when we were tootally-doing our asses off.  Is it the guy on Broadway right there?  Yeah.  I don't know how to find it because I totally-  Yeah, yeah.  How do you spell tootally-do?  Tootally-do.  It's on my fucking page.  A tootally-do.  I mean, it's not a cute kitten video, but it fucking did all right for the time. 
[00:50:30]  Little Beavis is fetching a pen.  Pop-O-B radio in the old search engine.  He fetches.  Little Beavis is going to be the worst cat.  Oh, he's going to be horrible.  I call him bitey now.  He's just a bitey cat.  Oh, God.  It's going to be not cute like so soon.  Oh, it's adorable.  Shut up, Sam Roberts.  You're just raising a terror.  And six months when you've got a 30-pound cat just biting you.  Yeah, you're trying to watch television.  You're going to-  Honestly, you're going to try to justify to yourself reasons to euthanize your cat. 
[00:51:00]  No!  Yeah, sure.  He's adorable little Beavis.  You'll probably break his leg on purpose by mistake, and then we have to put him down.  You're going to be like, well, he deserves a family.  Is it bad that I'm screaming like, Beavis, no!  You're already starting that shit?  Because he bites really hard.  You're in trouble.  Because he didn't put boundaries and limitations.  And he'll grab your pant leg and bite it, and then like a dog, he shakes his head.  It's weird.  I think he's got a little more wild animal in him than I thought.  Especially when you teach him that that's cute. 
[00:51:30]  It's adorable.  Yeah, I mean, at least you're training him.  Yeah, he climbs up my leg when I'm getting the cat food.  He's like, meh!  And I'm like, look, he's climbing my leg.  This is so cute.  But before the winter, you'll be coming in with marks on you daily.  Well, look.  See, I'm already pretty scraped.  Look, see?  These are all little bitey marks and scratchy marks.  It's going to get a lot worse before it gets any better.  He's adorable.  What could he do?  He's a kitten.  True.  He is going to either get lost in that Christmas tree of yours, or he's going to tear the whole thing down. 
[00:52:00]  He's already climbing that other tree that I have in there.  He gets in there and climbs.  It looks like a leopard sitting in the tree.  He's waiting to attack.  I know.  He does jump right at your face.  It's crazy.  Sitting on your floor when you get home one day.  I can't find the video.  No?  It's an older video.  Yeah, it got right in the guy's fucking face and totally dude it right to him.  He fucking, he's so fucking loud, he's annoying.  How did the cops not, like, shut him down? 
[00:52:30]  It goes way back there, Sam Roberts.  It's an old video.  The cops should shut him down.  They don't shut anyone down.  Times Square, he's fucking blasting.  If he's got amplifiers, he might have a permit to be there.  He might have a permit.  They don't shut any of those guys down.  I got a new one.  Yeah.  Have you seen the out of shape naked cowboy guy yet?  No.  Is he franchising?  There's an out of shape naked cowboy guy with all sorts of moles and skin shit going on.  And he was walking up to the women on 42nd Street right outside Gravity when we went and saw that. 
[00:53:00]  And he had the exact same fucking underpants that naked cowboy has got.  The exact same hat.  I mean, it was identical.  I thought it was the naked cowboy dude.  Oh, man.  And then this guy came closer, and he's a fucking wreck.  He was the naked cowboy's let himself go.  No.  Is he franchising?  He said he was going to, but I think there's probably a high likelihood of some dude just stealing the gimmick.  And saying, fuck you.  Well, that guy is not going to allow it, though.  He tried to stop Sandy Kane. 
[00:53:30]  It didn't work.  That's true.  But this guy had all sorts of moles and all sorts of shit going on.  Yeah.  And the women were horrified that he was walking up to.  Horrified.  I was laughing.  Oh, shit.  Hey, Roland, what did you think of Gravity?  I thought it was awesome.  The best movie of the year.  I loved it.  Yeah.  Best movie of the year.  Way better.  Wow.  It's all about space.  It's all about space.  What else is it about?  Better than Cats?  Better than Les Mis?  Yep. 
[00:54:00]  Was Cats a movie?  Give us a...  Somebody...  I think there was a commercial years ago for some Broadway show.  Oh.  And they went, better than Cats, better than Les Mis.  I have a hard time believing that, whatever it was.  Oh, well, please.  Give us, like, a description of the movie without, you know, giving away anything there, Roland.  Sandra Bullock and George Clooney.  See?  George Clooney.  Not another astronaut.  Right, right.  He just had George Clooney float around up there.  To fix a satellite.  They were already in space.  Hold on.  They were already in space. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, yeah.  They didn't go up to space.  Oh, yeah.  The movie starts...  I described the opening scene.  The astronauts use it.  They're already there.  In space.  Yeah, they're in space.  They're already there.  And then something happens.  Ooh.  Uh-huh.  And then what?  And then you get really dizzy with Sandra Bullock floating in space.  Oh, you do get dizzy.  There's some spinning going on.  Oh, you got dizzy by that?  Yeah.  I didn't get dizzy by that.  You didn't get nauseous?  No, I did all right with that.  I got a little dizzy.  I was like, ooh.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. 
[00:55:00]  And you stayed awake.  Yeah.  And you saved amazing seats, by the way.  Yes.  I go, whose seat is that?  No one's.  Whose seat is that?  No one's.  He had buffers for us.  He has buffer seats.  And this thing was so, like, sold out or whatever the hell.  No one had to pay, but you know what I mean.  The balls on you.  There's a buff to screen.  Every seat was taken.  Yeah.  Not near us, man.  No.  A set of balls on you.  And there's Roland telling people, no, people are coming.  People are coming.  They're having two more screenings of this today and Wednesday. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, man.  You should go.  You should go.  I think you would really enjoy it.  I think I'm free maybe tomorrow.  I really think you should go.  Wednesday they're having the IMAX screening, which I'm going to go to.  Oh.  Really?  Yeah, up there.  I'll go.  I'll go again.  I want to see that in IMAX.  You think it'll look even better in IMAX?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I can't wait.  Because that screen is two times bigger than what we saw it in.  We saw the giant one.  Yeah.  In Times Square.  Wait, IMAX, do you have to wear the glasses?  I always forget. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, yeah.  For 3D, yeah.  They give you those giant glasses.  So it's IMAX 3D?  But can you do regular IMAX?  No, it's IMAX 3D.  I always forget.  Because the space shuttle goes by.  You're like, ooh.  Mean Hatter.  Mean Hatter.  Dude, you realize how old we are, right?  Yes.  When we were in Boston, they were getting that whole IMAX thing together, and we had to  see that stupid shark guy.  Because they didn't have movies yet.  Oh, they didn't have any movies that were made in IMAX.  Remember?  Yes.  There he is.  There's the Tootally Doo guy.  Oh, where is he? 
[00:56:30]  This is what you're talking about.  Tootally Doo.  That's him.  Yes.  All right, watch this.  Oh, it's annoying.  Tootally Doo!  Right to his face.  Oh, he's looking right now again. 
[00:57:00]  And I didn't give him any money.  Oh, that guy is so annoying.  They sell the CDs, though.  It's a CD?  I thought he was selling the toodly-doos.  No, no.  He sells the CDs.  Oh, how annoying.  Yeah.  Who wants that?  Toodly-doo!  Thanks for taking me to Gravity, Roland. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, no problem.  It's awesome.  Clinty goes by in 3D.  He goes, psst, psst, psst, psst.  It was a space pack.  He goes, psst, psst, psst, psst.  Oh, right.  He stays right in front of you.  Like, ooh, Cluny.  Do those guys do their spacewalks untethered?  I don't even know that.  There's different types.  But do they?  Yeah, they have.  They actually are doing that now?  They got those.  Yeah, that's what was in the movie.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But they're actually using those now.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  Fuck yeah.  How long have they been using those?  I don't know. 
[00:58:00]  Actually, they've done untethered spacewalks.  That's going to be scary.  For a long fucking time.  It's going to be cool as shit, but also scary, man.  Really?  You know?  You're just hurtling through the cosmos.  So he's right.  George Clooney with the psst, psst, psst.  Yeah, it was awesome.  She was amazing, Sandra Bullock.  Yeah?  It's an Oscar movie.  You think Oscar worthy?  Every movie you see, you say it's Oscar worthy.  And what's that accent?  Yeah, what was that accent?  If you want me to...  Oscar.  They needed to develop the characters a little more.  They kind of pushed a storyline, you know, forward quickly. 
[00:58:30]  You didn't know, like, any background?  You got background, but it was the way they did it.  It was almost, as you like to say, shoehorned in there.  Like, all of a sudden, so tell me...  Like, he's like, so where are you from?  And I'm thinking to myself, well, if they're both in space together, they probably know that already.  Just that unnatural dialogue that's obviously, let's inform the audience of our characters.  Yes, yes, yes.  Ham-handed.  I didn't feel that.  I felt like they trained separately, and they just met each other. 
[00:59:00]  No, they don't put people in space.  Roland, don't worry.  I gave it a very good review, but I'm just saying, there was a better way of doing that,  because I'm like, what do you mean, where are you from?  I think they would have fucking...  They're already in space.  And Roland, now we'll get to know each other.  Right.  Opie said, perhaps George Clooney might be coming in.  Oh, he does radio?  What the fuck?  You're changing your tune?  You got hoodwinked.  You got bamboozled.  There's no way we get George Clooney, right? 
[00:59:30]  I don't think he does barely any interviews, even for TV.  He doesn't...  He doesn't need to.  He's George Clooney.  Yeah.  Right.  But him being George Clooney, I knew that he was George Clooney.  Yeah.  In space.  I didn't think I was looking at an astronaut.  I was like, oh, wow, look, cool.  George Clooney.  George Clooney in space.  Yeah.  He's so famous that NASA said, fuck it, let's put George Clooney up there for this movie.  Right?  Mm-hmm.  It's like one of those Richard Branson trips.  Oh, right, man.  The effects were awesome, though.  The explosions, you're like, oh.  It really was. 
[01:00:00]  How did they fucking film the movie?  Was there a lot of underwater shit to get them all, or did they do the...  I don't know.  There's a lot of floating scenes.  You're like, ooh.  Do you think that they were flipping, or was the camera moving around them so it looked  motion tracking?  Maybe they got some new technology, because I was completely convinced they were just kind  of twirling around the whole fucking time.  It was flawless.  Pretty cool.  It really was.  Yeah, but I saw Jurassic Park, and I was like, where'd they get those velociraptors from?  Exactly.  His backyard.  They didn't go in the...  What is it called?  The puke comet?  The vomit comet. 
[01:00:30]  The vomit comet.  Yeah.  There's no way they're getting George Clooney and Sandra Bullock in the vomit comet to film  some scenes, right?  Yeah.  And those are like, for very small spaces, like, who used that?  Apollo 13.  Apollo 13.  Yeah.  They used that, because they were in...  They were able to build the set inside the vomit comet, and when they did it, it's like,  okay, now go through this tunnel, and it looks like a weightless.  But if you're in space, like...  She was doing some of that shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She was, like, swimming in the air. 
[01:01:00]  That's the only way I could explain it.  Like, how the fuck do they do that?  Even, like, when she had the water, she used to float.  Maybe they've gotten good with suspending people in front of green screens.  I don't know.  It doesn't look like a wire anymore.  It was pretty impressive.  It was pretty impressive.  Yeah.  It was really impressive.  Very natural motion.  They were able to...  And what were you telling me?  The director wanted just no sound in the whole movie or something?  Yeah, but that's where, like, when...  Because space has no sound.  Right.  So when it's out in space, you hear nothing.  You don't even hear... 
[01:01:30]  You do it in your head, you know.  You'd hear inside your space suit.  You'd hear stuff.  You do hear it when they plant Sandra Bullock's video.  Yeah, you'd hear that.  But outside, you wouldn't hear anything.  I think there's just the wind blowing through your ears.  Probably.  Something could explode, and you wouldn't hear it.  Yeah, they did have that.  You'd hear the explosion, and there's no sound.  And when you see Earth from space, you just realize how stupid it is that we're all just  killing each other.  So dumb.  That the government is shutting down tomorrow. 
[01:02:00]  All that shit.  Yeah.  We're pretty dumb.  It's so stupid when you realize we're just...  I mean, you can't even...  People try, but like I've said many times, we're not even a piece of dust floating in  this room right now, Earth.  No.  And we insist on fucking killing each other.  Yeah, fucking bacteria.  Just bacteria.  And I'm talking more like, you know, over religion and all that shit, more than anything.  That's where I find it completely ridiculous.  Those are goofy beliefs.  People are going to kill. 
[01:02:30]  Animals are going to kill for whatever.  But that over the top, I have to kill you because your religion is different than mine  is so ridiculous.  It's so ridiculous when you see Earth from fucking space.  Yeah, it is fucked up.  Let's smoke a joint.  Government shuts down tomorrow, huh?  Does that mean...  You think they're going to let it all go to shit?  They're not because they, you know, their careers are on the line, so they're going to have  to figure something out.  But the Republicans are going to do what they want to do, and they know that they'll still 
[01:03:00]  get the votes from the Republicans and vice versa.  Right.  Democrats, same thing.  And each is blaming the other side.  Right.  Well, we want to defund Obamacare, and if you don't negotiate, you're the one shutting  the government down.  Right.  And then, well, you can't shut the government down because you want to defund something,  so, eh.  Do we have to pay our taxes?  Oh, yeah.  Why do we get fucked in the end?  If they're shutting everything down, shouldn't we, the people, go, well, fuck you then? 
[01:03:30]  The IRS has shut down.  No, I'm going to figure out exactly how much of my money goes to taxes every day, and I'm  going to just fucking deduct that.  You get a speeding ticket, and you go, fuck you.  Because the government shut down.  Government shut down.  They're not working.  You get a discount.  Like, when the cable system goes down, you call them up and say, I was without cable for  three days.  They go, all right, well, credit your account.  They do that now, huh?  So I want the IRS to credit my account.  Of course.  You shut down, we shut down.  That's it.  That's what we do now. 
[01:04:00]  What happened, what was it, 17 years ago when the government shut down?  Do we have any-  Totally anarchy.  Was it anarchy?  Yep.  Did the world end?  Yes.  What do you mean?  I thought we shut down the government recently.  No, almost recently.  No, almost.  But we didn't get there.  The last minute, they came in.  Oh.  I mean, what happens when there's no teachers or principal in the school?  Mm.  They get to run amok.  They get to go to school.  Hmm?  It's government jobs.  What about the army?  What about-  No army.  What about, um- 
[01:04:30]  No army.  What about, like, air traffic control and-  Nope.  What?  No mail.  What?  Oh, my God.  Government shutdown's a government shutdown.  This is like Y2K.  What about the FBI?  No FBI.  CIA?  Wow.  No CIA.  Forget about Homeland Security.  That's done.  Cronuts?  Flair Danes is out of job.  What about Cronuts?  What about the Cronuts?  We're so good.  Here's a new one.  Cronuts.  Pinecone.  Actually, I believe-  I know where he got the Cronut idea from.  Uh-oh.  Oh, shit.  From France?  From me. 
[01:05:00]  That Papa Bear's place on the Upper West Side.  Papa Bear's.  Papa something, yes.  He stole it from Papa Bear?  I will bring in something that is just as tasty as the Cronut.  Oh, boy.  I say to you.  Ha.  And it was around way before the Cronut.  Cronut killer?  No.  He's got a new fucking dessert.  Pinecone.  I thought the-  Pinecone.  The dessert he brought in here was the new dessert.  That was a new one.  And then people were, like, fading out.  They go, here's a new one.  Boom.  Hot again.  So that wasn't that hot, so he had to go with the Pinecone?  Yeah.  Gotcha.  I think in the event of a government shutdown, the Cronut guy is actually the next person 
[01:05:30]  in charge.  Probably.  Line of succession.  I'm in charge here at the White House.  Yeah.  I'm the Cronut guy.  Dominique Ansel comes in.  Hello, hello.  Cronut guy.  He has a new apple Cronuts tomorrow.  I'll write with his dumb new Cronuts.  It's delicious.  He's never going to have another hit.  You know, someone said I was very disrespectful because I called him the Cronut guy.  That's what he is.  Thank you.  He's the Cronut guy. 
[01:06:00]  When we introduced him to Hugh Jackman, I'm like, hey, the Cronut guy.  Yeah.  And someone said it was very disrespectful that I didn't call him by name.  Oh, fuck.  At that point, I didn't even know his name.  Fuck them.  Fuck him.  He's like the Cronut guy.  Cronut guy.  That's a good title to have, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, your pastry is more famous than you are.  Right.  You're the Cronut guy.  Don't make it about him.  He sells Cronut posters and everything.  Who's hanging up a Cronut poster?  Quite frankly.  I'm surprised there's not one in Roland's office already.  You think Roland would have one?  Yeah. 
[01:06:30]  There's one in my room.  Yeah.  Could you sign my Cronut poster?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I remember maybe, you know, Cheryl Teagues.  I don't.  No.  This guy's going to clear up a lot of things about the government shutdown because he thinks  we weren't kidding.  Paul in Massachusetts.  Paul.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Paul.  I sell.  There are certain people that are exempt from the shutdown.  For example, the military, the air traffic controllers, certain security positions and 
[01:07:00]  things like that.  Yeah, I know.  Those were all jokes.  Oh, were they?  Sorry, man.  I missed it.  Whoa.  Well, I think what made it very clear was when I said the Cronut guy would be in charge.  You know, that was to push our concept forward in case people weren't understanding what we  were doing there.  Then you go over the top with one and people go, oh, they were fucking around the whole  time.  Now I get it.  Cronut guy. 
[01:07:30]  I'm quite certain that nobody thinks 17 years ago we lived in a state of complete anarchy.  I don't know.  It was a long time ago.  Pew, pew!  Listen, I just tuned over and I caught the end of it.  Oh.  It's all right.  Aw.  My bad.  Hey, I really don't know this.  Did the Patriots win last night?  I'm not a football fan.  They did win.  Travis is telling me.  Yeah.  What was the score?  30-23.  Really?  How was Brady's receivers?  Are they coming along, Travis?  Strong.  Do you know? 
[01:08:00]  I was watching Breaking Bad.  Oh, right.  Right.  And then I watched Talking Bad.  I did too, yeah.  You know what was so great about Breaking Bad?  It was the only time you could tweet about watching something on a Sunday that isn't football  and half the people on Twitter are going, don't you know football's on?  Hey, homo, there's football on.  What are you, a faggot?  I got one of those for something.  Football.  Except Breaking Bad.  Breaking Bad, you're okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, this time you were the homo if you were watching football. 
[01:08:30]  Hey, idiot.  Isn't the government kind of shut down right now, sort of?  Because they're just babbling about shit instead of actually getting shit done?  Yeah, don't we have some kind of fucking dumb thing going on?  Like, they weren't shut down, but, like, the money wasn't being used, or...  Oh, God, I hate them all.  Well, there was a filibuster last week.  Oh.  Dude was reading Green Eggs and Ham.  I just know they're going to start furloughing people.  Like, I know some people. 
[01:09:00]  I know some people.  FBI agents are going to be furloughed for a few days.  What does that mean?  Well, that means every so often, you don't come in, and you don't get paid for it.  Boo.  And regardless of what happens, it could be the hugest terrorist event ever, they can't  come in.  They're not allowed to come in because they would literally get in trouble.  Wouldn't the bad guys know this?  I would assume.  They do now if they listen to the Opie and Anthony program.  And they do.  Oh, yes.  You know who would break that furlough? 
[01:09:30]  Who?  Jack Bauer.  Jack Bauer would.  Yeah, but he's too busy tackling Christmas trees.  If he gets injured, then it's his own dime.  He's not insured.  He's not fucking...  He's not going to get injured.  That's the chance I'm willing to take.  He's somewhere shirtless in a bar right now getting drunk.  Haven't you guys learned anything?  Whose idea was it, by the way, to let Kiefer Sutherland sell tequila?  Have you seen the commercials?  No.  But Kiefer Sutherland's like, yeah, fucking...  He's selling tequila like he's a responsible drinker? 
[01:10:00]  I mean, he knows his drinks.  Like, that's what the tequila company wants as its impression, as a guy that dives into  Christmas trees in the lobbies of hotels because he's hammered drunk?  I haven't seen that yet.  Yeah, look.  Here it is.  Get a little volume.  Cuervo.  Now, this is a guy who got drunk and melted the prototype of his own action figure, correct?  Yes.  This guy has numerous stories of his drunkenness and his inability to handle his alcoholic beverages. 
[01:10:30]  Selling booze now.  Have a Cuervo.  Have an adventure.  What's he doing?  That's the loot.  Have an audience.  Wow, you're really good.  Oh, thank you.  Educate in the checkup!  Have a disagreement.  Makeup.  All night long.  Oh. 
[01:11:00]  It's the long version.  Have a souvenir.  Have a sensitive sign.  Have some friends over.  All right.  He's going to make out with an old man.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Have a second thought.  Oh.  That's something he never does.  No fight for.  I don't have any regrets.  No regrets. 
[01:11:30]  Have a story.  See, he goes, just don't have any regrets.  Have a story.  They're kind of tying into the fact, like, look, I'm an asshole and I'm drunk, but I have no  regrets.  He's not an asshole.  He's probably the nicest person in the world when he's drunk.  Oh, my God.  I mean, we're, we're, he's basically saying we all know you get really fucked up on tequila.  Tequila will fuck you up.  No regrets.  No regrets.  Just have a story.  Have a story.  It doesn't matter what that story is.  As long as it starts with, so I was fucked up on tequila.  I'm 100% sure that in his life he has been on the back of a public bus playing the lute 
[01:12:00]  before.  Probably.  All fucked up.  Probably.  Oh, sure.  Yeah, this is from his own life.  Yeah, these are his stories.  He came to the meeting with all his own stories.  Except he didn't walk away from that fight club.  He got his ass kicked.  Oh, I'm sure.  Yeah.  I say we do the, uh, the, uh, tequila commercial, like the Honey Nuts Cheerios commercial.  Oh, make it like, you know, if you're drinking the fucking, uh, Cuervo, it's like drinking  with your abusive alcoholic grandfather.  Yes, yes, it is.  She gets all choked up. 
[01:12:30]  I saw that commercial again.  Oh, isn't it terrible?  I would have never noticed that commercial.  Cause I am Mr. Commercial.  I tune out commercials.  Like, I think they're a complete waste of time, even though we do commercial reads on this  show.  I think I actually get more into a commercial than the show sometimes.  Really?  Like, I, I fucking, I love looking at every little fucking thing in commercials.  That Honey Nuts Cheerios, like having breakfast with Nana crap.  Yeah.  Well, Cheerios the same when you were young.  Did your grandma give you Cheerios? 
[01:13:00]  Did Nana give you Cheerios?  Oh yeah, it wasn't Honey Nuts.  It was the shitty version.  Yeah, it was Cheerios.  Where is it?  Cheerios.  Here's the one we're talking about.  Honey Nuts Cheerios.  Mom, did Nana ever give you Cheerios when you were a little kid?  Yeah, she did.  Were Cheerios the same back then?  Cheerios has pretty much been the same forever.  Oh, they're swallowing.  So, when we have Cheerios, it's kind of like we're having breakfast with Nana.  Yes, it is.  It is.  Yes, you're right. 
[01:13:30]  Wouldn't you slap the kid for the memory?  Yeah, stop it.  Look, I didn't want to think of Nana today.  Asshole.  Your Nana was a fucking cunt.  Right.  Great, now I gotta remember Nana on her.  That's fucking.  Is that one of Kiefer's tequila stories?  There's a picture of him.  It says, caught with his pants down.  He's sitting at a booth in a bar, whatever, restaurant, bar.  With a bunch of dudes.  All dudes.  His pants is an underwear. 
[01:14:00]  And underwear.  Below his knees.  Pulled down below his knees as he's sitting at this booth with his pants down.  Still technically on his body.  You know what?  Have a story.  No regrets.  Have a story.  Yeah, no regrets.  Come on.  With his hand on his penis and testicles.  Yes, he's touching himself.  With Time Warner Cable.  Hey.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I decided to come in your living room with some of my bad acting. 
[01:14:30]  His horrible hand gestures.  Oh, my God.  They just will not stop with that Bill Cowher shit.  He's awful.  With Time Warner Cable.  That, yeah, there's just a few commercials on now that really get me.  I love the fucking Swiffer.  Yeah, yeah, Lee and Morty.  Morty.  That one rules.  Morty, are you listening to me?  Morty?  Oh, he's going to wait until she's on one of those chairs reaching and just fucking kick it out from under her. 
[01:15:00]  Morty, my hip is shattered.  Love Morty.  Morty and Lee.  Actually, I like Lee.  You like Lee?  You like a clean kitchen.  I don't do any cleaning.  I make dirt.  Dirt.  I'm not big enough or strong enough for this.  There should be some ways to make it easier.  Here's a box, babe.  Open it up.  Oh, my goodness. 
[01:15:30]  What is it?  Oh, my goodness.  Some kind of a mopping device.  Some kind of a mopping device.  There's a lot of dirt on here.  Morty?  Nails and scraps of metal just fly everywhere.  Yes.  Oh, that would be great.  And then they dance in the kitchen.  And they do that old person.  How many different Mortys are there?  Oh, my God.  I heard something there.  I want to go old school and maybe do some beeps with that.  Oh.  It might work.  Yeah, that could be.  You want to give it a try? 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  There's another version, too.  Maybe put the two versions together and maybe try to make one super version where it sounds  like they're talking dirty.  Yeah.  Or Lee and Morty.  Dirty, dirty.  Talking about sex.  It's Greg Brady's birthday today.  What?  Well, I haven't talked to him since the famous cold call.  Well, today seems like a good day for that.  How old is he?  59, it looks like.  59.  Wow. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, I mean, he needs to know that somebody's thinking about him on his birthday.  You think?  Absolutely.  You called Paul Williams.  Yeah, if he finds out that you called Paul Williams on his birthday.  That's true.  And you didn't call him.  This is a man who's invited you into his home.  That's a really good point.  Plus, he's old.  He's probably up.  No, he doesn't like being woken up.  Oh, boy.  How do you know?  Oh, boy.  I was a little nervous.  He does not like the cold call in the morning.  Because you called him at 5 a.m. Branson time?  Yeah, that's right. 
[01:17:00]  Hey, we haven't spoken in a while.  You're on the air.  And something tells me if you're asleep in Branson, you want to remain dreaming and asleep as long as possible before you open your eyes and go, oh, fuck, I'm in Branson.  You look over and your Johnny Bravo jacket is hanging off the closet.  You realize what your day is going to be like.  You pick up your phone.  You go to check the weather.  And you look and it says Branson, Missouri.  And you're like, oh, right.  It's not Los Angeles.  It's not New York.  I'm Chicago. 
[01:17:30]  I'm here in Branson, Missouri.  Well, he would be stupid to have his phone on again, right?  Oh, no.  Oh, this is terrible.  Right now he's panicked.  Why?  Is my family okay?  Something happened to Jan or Cindy?  What happened? 
[01:18:00]  What was that, Alice?  Hi, this is Barry.  Please leave a message.  Oh.  Did we leave it?  At the tone, please record your message.  When you finish recording, you may hang up or press 1 for more.  We'll call later.  Barry, Opie and Anthony, happy birthday.  Hey, we'll try to call you again later.  20 minutes.  But happy birthday, my old friend.  Happy birthday.  We didn't forget.  Love you, miss you. 
[01:18:30]  Love you, miss you.  Oh, man.  That's good, right?  Happy birthday.  Cold calls are my favorite bit of all time.  Oh.  Hi, it's Barry.  We should call Paul Williams if fucking Barry's not picking up.  But what do we have to call Paul about?  He's coming to the studio this week.  What?  Yeah, just say, you know, we just heard you're coming in.  I got it.  I don't know if you knew this, but it's Barry Williams' birthday.  Hey, where's my fucking Paul Williams number?  He's promoting the Muppets.  Wow, he wasn't important enough to put him in the phone last time we did this? 
[01:19:00]  What are you, Paul?  I sleep.  Just an old-fashioned love song.  Coming down in three-part harmony.  Just an old-fashioned love song.  One I'm sure they wrote for you on me.  There it is.  How many years ago was the Love Boat theme?  That was last week.  Love, exciting in you.  Climb aboard.  We're expecting you, the love boat. 
[01:19:30]  It's probably the 25th anniversary of the Muppets on Wednesday.  Soon, we'll be making another run.  A love boat.  It was released in 79.  1979?  That's 21, 34 years ago.  All right, I got this.  You know Paul is taking every call it comes in, too.  Oh, yeah.  He doesn't let voicemail pick up.  No way.  He's a go-getter, mover and a shaker.  His little legs take a little longer to get to the phone. 
[01:20:00]  He's okay.  He'll be there, though.  He's jumping out of the back.  Who's calling me on the phone?  Someone's ringing my phone.  Hi, it's Paul.  Leave a message with your phone number, and I'll get back to you as quickly as possible.  Leave a message after the tune.  Hey, Paul.  Did you realize that it was 34 years ago you came up with that Love Boat song?  Amazing.  Paul Williams, we love you, man.  Opie and Anthony, 34 years ago, the Love Boat theme.  You're coming into the show when? 
[01:20:30]  When, Roland?  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  We're very psyched to see you again.  We'll see you Wednesday here in New York for the Muppets thing, I think, right?  Yeah, probably the Muppets.  25 years of the Muppets.  That's what we're doing.  All right, Paul.  The Love Boat.  Give me a call back later.  Soon we'll be making another run.  The Love Boat.  All right, Paul.  Love you, miss you.  Love you, miss you.  How insincere is love you, miss you. 
[01:21:00]  If we spent the next three hours leaving voicemails on celebrities' phones, I'd be totally fine with it.  I'd be as satisfied as the fucking Breaking Bad finale.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, well.  Yeah, yeah, boy.  Why didn't he answer that time?  I don't know.  Fucking mad now.  Well, maybe he's very busy.  Not answer.  Touring.  Writing.  Yeah.  Sleeping, because it's early in the morning.  And where does he live?  L.A.  L.A.  Oh, Christ. 
[01:21:30]  It's 4.30.  4.30.  He should be up at 4.30.  Or maybe he's not in bed yet.  Right.  Yeah.  All right, we should break.  Yeah.  And let's take a break.  Baseball's almost over, right?  Uh, yeah, it's pretty much over for them.  Well, the Rangers and the Rays have to play one more.  Yeah.  God, 162 games and it comes down to one fucking dumb game today.  Poor stupid Yankees had to play their fucking extra innings and you know they were just like, 
[01:22:00]  come on.  We just want to go home.  Just stop.  We want to start our vacations.  This is nothing.  And then what?  Andy Pettit did all right.  He wins his last game.  Did he win that fucking extra innings?  Yeah, complete game.  Yeah, complete game, huh?  That's a complete game for his last.  You know what that does to a guy?  You know, maybe I could come back next year for a little.  I still got it.  I think you want to go out not in style.  You want to get your ass kicked so you have no doubt in your head that it's over.  It was time to go. 
[01:22:30]  But you know, after that game, he's like, you know what?  If I work out a little extra hard this winter, I think I might be able to get a few more starts in.  I'm going to work at it harder than most, but I think I could still do that.  Yeah.  And then they just get rocked.  You know the athlete's mind.  He has to think that shit, right?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll break.  I don't think there's any question.  Who's going to be filling that slot?  We got any good E-Rock songs overnight?  Somebody, I haven't listened to it yet, but somebody sent me an E-Rock, what's his name, game. 
[01:23:00]  Dickie Goodman?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  I know, the guy tweeted me a hundred times.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, Jesus.  A hundred fucking times.  Don't worry.  We see your tweets.  Yeah, it stayed on the air, so hopefully they'll stop coming in.  Right.  The tweets, I mean, from that guy.  Right.  We can play it.  It's all right.  Where is the E?  He's out today?  He's out.  I think he's out all week.  Till further notice?  Which is not going to sit well with... 
[01:23:30]  Where's he going on vacation?  The new boss.  I know where he is.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Is he at Disney?  Yeah.  I don't think he wants people to know.  You know how secret.  Why don't we call him?  Is it Disneyland or Disney World?  Cold call him.  I mean, if I had to guess, it would be World.  Whoa, is he at that too much?  Disney World.  I'm guessing.  Oh, so he just flew home.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's from Florida.  Florida, where he was originally from.  Born and raised.  Then forwarded to an automation.  Oh.  E-Rock.  Oh, he's on to us this time. 
[01:24:00]  E-Rock's on to us.  E-Rock.  Do you know what resort he's staying at?  I bet we could call him.  Uh, I think I do.  The Nagels, please.  Oh, he's on to us.  Not even a ringy-dingy-ding.  Is he there already now?  Yeah.  He was texting me last night.  Oh, he's on to us.  He knows how jealous I am.  You should try to call his hotel room from there.  I think I know what resort he's at.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, it's a big guy in a small world. 
[01:24:30]  You think he gets on a little boat ride and goes, pretty cool, huh?  Well, it's a food and wine festival over there right now.  Oh, it is?  Yeah.  At Epcot.  At Epcot?  Yeah.  That's awesome.  Yeah, I was there once for that.  Delicious foods.  Is it good?  Good stuff.  I'm going to the New York Food Festival in a few weeks.  Hey, can I have the This is the End DVD?  I don't need all that other shit, though.  It's mastered in 4K.  Who gives a fuck?  That's a good pistol case right there.  Does it make the comedy better?  Yeah, because it's nine minutes of extra footage. 
[01:25:00]  That's outrageous.  That's nothing to do with the 4K.  Extra footage usually sucks.  There was a reason why they didn't put it in the actual movie.  Did you see how...  Dude, over 50 hours of bonus footage for Breaking Bad coming out.  What do you mean?  DVDs that they're putting out?  You know what they do?  What?  When they say hours of bonus features, they count the director's commentary as hours of  bonus features.  So when you get a DVD that's got a director's commentary on it, if it's a three-hour movie 
[01:25:30]  right there, three hours of bonus features.  And it's like, no, it's the same movie.  Yeah, but you know what?  There's a two-hour documentary in that set that I can't wait to watch.  And it comes in a little barrel.  They send you the barrel.  Yeah.  Are we getting that?  Can we get like eight barrels?  They send me one.  Tell them we need like 18 of them.  We need a lot.  We need seven of them buried in the desert.  The commentary thing went away for the most part.  Remember, that was such a cool feature when it first hit.  Kind of was.  Yeah.  And now people, not so much.  Right here.  Not so much.  That's where we're going to comment.  Hey, whatever happened to Ron Howard? 
[01:26:00]  I thought he was calling our show for Rush.  Oh, boy.  I thought he was directing another movie right now.  That's why he was impressed for Rush.  Well, screw him then.  It was a good movie, though.  That Rush doesn't look very good.  It's pretty good.  It looks like I don't care.  It's like I don't care.  I see the trailer and I go, all right.  Race cars and stuff are cool and all, but.  Based on a true story.  But I don't care.  Yeah, the real guy was racing six weeks later.  It's tough because it's F1 and that's not really popular here. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, it'll do good in Europe.  I bet you it does good in Italy.  Eh?  Yeah.  Eh.  Yeah, just wait until Thor 2.  I liked that other race movie.  The racing movie.  Cool Runnings?  Then the Thunder thing?  No.  Tom Cruise?  The Thunder thing.  The Thunder thing.  He's the best.  That's it.  No, the Ballad of.  Ballad of Ricky Bobby?  Ricky Bobby. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, yeah.  Talladega Nights.  Talladega Nights.  Talladega Nights.  I like that one.  Baby Jesus.  Ricky Bobby.  It's a great movie.  That is so stupid and hilarious.  I piss excellence.  Invisible fire.  Eh, shit.  All right.  Well, our cold calling is not doing well today, Sam.  Oh, Obi, what's that?  What happened?  We have.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:27:30]  Oh.  We'll explain next.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony show will return in a moment.  After all, millionaires have been pissed, too.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Oh.  Oh.  Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I know. 
[01:28:00]  You appreciate a good jam band, don't you?  No.  I think we've established that I don't.  You're a liar.  No.  You had nine teeth removed, and you love jam bands.  I did not have nine teeth removed.  Not even close to none.  I didn't even.  I had one tooth removed, and one kind of root canaled.  It's Trey's birthday. 
[01:28:30]  Fish.  Little fish.  This is such shit.  There's only nine more minutes, so let's relax.  Oh.  What's the name of this?  This is Stash.  I just don't know fish.  No, they all sounded the same to me when I was trying to pick one.  He's 49 today, the Trey guy.  Oh.  Godspeed.  You don't have his number?  We can call him up.  Wish him a happy birthday. 
[01:29:00]  George Brett had his 3,000th hit 21 years ago today.  21 years ago.  Any excuse to play the George Brett shit stories?  I already have it loaded up.  All right, good.  Okay, good.  The shit stories.  Going into break, we'll play the George Brett shit story.  Please, we have to.  We have to do that.  It's a tradition whenever we mention George Brett.  Yes.  So I see you might have got one of these.  Oh, my goodness.  Yes.  Of course, over the weekend, I decided I needed my iPhone 5S. 
[01:29:30]  5Cs are out there en masse.  Yes, en masse.  But the 5S is, you can't find one.  Okay.  So I went to one of the stores that wasn't the Apple store.  Went to a Verizon store to look for one.  And they didn't have them either.  So I start poking around.  I'm like, you know, I've been talking about wanting to check out the old Galaxy S4. 
[01:30:00]  So I was poking around a little bit.  And I'm like, you know what?  I'll take it.  Wow.  Yep.  So I bought one.  Wow.  And now I have two phones.  Right.  And I've been using both of them.  Mm-hmm.  And I'm doing a little comparison.  What do you think so far?  A little comparison.  Listen, well, they both do have their own unique features that I like it.  I like it a lot.  Where's my... 
[01:30:30]  What?  Taste?  I told you so.  No, it's not an I told you so moment.  We're not in that situation right now.  I don't think so.  You said you like it.  I've been telling you about this phone for two years.  Yeah, but I know, but...  I don't even have the S4.  No?  What's the difference between the S3 and the S4?  One.  One better?  Just one number.  One better, though.  Yeah, it's one more better.  Well, that's good.  I just...  I like my S3 so much, I just didn't upgrade it.  Yeah.  I probably should, though. 
[01:31:00]  Like, well, I don't know, because I didn't have the S3.  The Note's coming out in a couple days.  I got to take a look at the Note.  Yeah.  And if the Samsung people make the Note, I mean, just a...  I'll go with a smidge.  Yeah.  A smidge smaller, I think I might go Note.  I was looking at some of the Notes.  They're pretty cool, right?  Yeah.  But they didn't have the new one out yet, so I wasn't going to get that.  And they do fit in your back pocket.  I don't know.  As long as you get that phone in your pocket, you're good.  But you'd crush it if you sat down.  You think?  Yeah.  I like the front pocket. 
[01:31:30]  I like the shirt pocket, things like that.  And this fits in the shirt pocket, so that's fine.  I put all my stuff in the penis pocket.  Oh, do you?  That little penis pocket?  Oh, not the little pocket.  I just call it the penis pocket.  I put all my shit in my front pockets.  Yeah.  So if you're robbing me, that's where my shit is.  Oh.  I just feel like I could...  It would be nice of you to tell them.  I feel like I could get...  Someone could pickpocket me easily.  I know.  The back pocket?  So I put it all in my penis pocket.  I'm not a fan of the back pocket for things that aren't, like, really shoved in me. 
[01:32:00]  I'm just convinced.  I've seen a couple of those videos.  Like, how do you not notice the guy taking the watch off your arm?  Yeah, pretty good.  Right?  So I'm fucked.  A wallet out of the back pocket's got to be a piece of cake if some of these guys could  take a fucking watch off you.  Anyway, go ahead.  Sorry.  Well, I have...  I now understand what people are saying when they say that the iPhone's new iOS 7 is kind  of trying to emulate what...  The Android.  What the Galaxy has. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, the Android system.  Right.  And they're failing miserably, I think.  Right.  I like the customizability of the Samsung Galaxy.  It's very cool.  You're not pigeonholed to all Apple products.  Nope.  Which is good.  I like that.  I love the big screen.  God damn.  Yeah, I can fucking sling box shit from home.  Netflix and videos look great.  Yeah, I don't understand why Apple hasn't come out with a phone that just has a bigger 
[01:33:00]  screen.  That would get people...  Well, they don't need our help.  No.  Because they're selling just fine.  But I don't know.  Maybe they're holding that technology back.  I don't know.  Until they see an actual drop.  But that's the one thing I do like about the iPhone.  I could just use my thumb and without even an effort, I could get to every part of the  screen.  You gotta stretch a little bit with the Samsung.  This is like, you know, you're playing fucking piano.  You gotta stretch a little bit.  You gotta really kind of stretch to reach things. 
[01:33:30]  True.  On this.  But the videos look great, right?  Videos look great.  But your Metallica video you shot on your...  On the iPhone, that looked fantastic and sounded great.  Now, I have a question for you.  I Instagrammed my videos at Metallica.  Yeah.  Is there different...  This is gonna sound dumb, but whatever.  Because I really don't know.  Is there a different technology when you're using the Instagram app?  I think they compress it.  They do, right?  I think it's compressed more.  Yeah.  Because they're not expecting you to try to get a little taste of a concert? 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  You're not getting the high quality that YouTube can give you.  Because I couldn't believe how bad the audio sounded.  It was terrible.  Not even close to what you got out of your iPhone.  And then I'm thinking, man, if I used just a Samsung video, it probably would have came  out better, I think.  Yeah.  And then upload it to YouTube, high quality, and put the link up.  It would have been good.  Just going for quick hits while I was there with my Instagram crap.  And it just didn't work.  I hated it.  Yeah.  I got to delete those, not let it think about.  But what else do you like about the Samsung? 
[01:34:30]  The way you can hook up all your pages and the apps and move them around.  And move them around.  Just the fact that you can really customize the shit out of it.  The Samsung bloatware had to go.  Like, their stupid store that they have there is just the worst.  But I guess you use Play Store.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah.  That works good.  And, yeah, like, my security camera stuff, drop cams.  I could punch them up. 
[01:35:00]  And, like, big fucking screen, nice video.  I like it.  My typing is taking a little getting used to.  I like typing on the iPhone better.  It seems a little easier.  I don't know.  It might just be.  My big, stupid fucking wide thumb is a nightmare with the Samsung.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because their keyboard does seem a little, like.  Anyone that gets a text from me knows that I have a retard thumb.  Get a different keyboard.  Getting letters wrong all the time.  And I push send before I can fix it.  Someone's telling me to get a different keyboard. 
[01:35:30]  Okay.  I'll do that.  What do you mean?  Yeah, I guess you could download a different keyboard so you could use a different keyboard.  I didn't know that.  Isn't that cool?  That is cool.  I had no idea about that one.  Oh.  I don't know.  Swift key?  And what's going on?  Swipe?  What's going on with Apple?  When are they going to get new phones in?  Oh, man.  There's people in my family.  They're waiting for their new phones and they just can't find them.  I'm here on end of October.  What are you talking about, end of October? 
[01:36:00]  Get those little Chinese kids working.  What the hell is going on?  It is ridiculous.  Why didn't they make enough?  It's fucking ridiculous.  And look what they made me do.  They made me go out and get a Galaxy.  Yeah, that's what they do every time.  Are they really saying end of October now?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's available to ship.  Like, online, it just says October now.  Well, October is tomorrow.  Yeah, but it's not tomorrow.  But they mean end of October, yeah.  They really mean end of October for the new iPhone 5?  At least the middle, yeah.  You're going to push people to the sand? 
[01:36:30]  There's people that still need to buy their fucking phones.  They do this every single time.  I hate that they do this.  But it never...  Hold it back a little bit.  I get it.  But there are people now just annoyed.  Yeah, completely annoyed.  You have them as customers, and they've gone to your store a few times now.  They need their phones.  Exactly.  Apple's made a business of annoying customers for a long time, and it's worked very well for them.  All right, make them go, oh, man, not today.  Sorry.  But the next time they come back, you should have the phone there.  Nope.  People who accept one or two times. 
[01:37:00]  Tops.  I don't know.  Not with Apple.  People in my family are up to three or four times going by the store going, what the fuck?  Because like Ann said, and I saw for myself, these assholes that work in the glass boxes,  they don't want to give you any info.  Right.  Their whole thing is to keep it as vague as possible.  But this is every release they do this, and it takes, I mean, it takes weeks and weeks.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah.  But it never hurts business.  Right.  No.  Like Apple customers keep coming back because they want an iPhone. 
[01:37:30]  Because even, you know, Samsung might do this better, it might do that better, but at the end of the day,  it's just not the thing that they want.  The thing that I want, whatever.  An iPhone.  It's not that.  Oh, this guy got an iPhone yesterday.  He's going to tell us where he got it.  Oh.  Just in Florida.  That way it'll be sold out again.  In Florida?  Justin.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I've been searching for the phone because I had the 4S, and it wasn't really working well,  and I run a business from the phone.  I'm so crazy I couldn't find one. 
[01:38:00]  Sounds crazy.  I went online, and I started searching, and someone said, go to Radio Shack.  What?  They sell them at Radio Shack, and people never go into Radio Shack.  Yeah, Radio Shack's just a shitty store.  Yeah.  I don't even know what half that stuff is they sell.  Right?  Who goes there?  I guess this guy's right.  Why would they sell, uh...  Yeah?  Yeah, they sell them at, like, Radio Shack, Best Buy, all those stores.  Best Buy?  What the hell is that?  It's a big media, big box store.  No, it used to be.  Wouldn't you just buy shit online? 
[01:38:30]  You can't.  But you can't buy the iPhone online.  Well, no, you can't.  All right.  You know what?  I might just try that today.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Great show.  Yeah, I know.  Of course it is.  We know that already.  Stop it.  Jesus.  Right.  Apple became the number one company in the world.  Oh, yeah?  What?  As far...  Hello?  As far as what?  I don't know.  Like money?  They just said it on the news, so I just repeated it to sound smart.  Yeah. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, the...  You know what was number one for the longest time, and they're no longer number one for the  first time?  Guess what company?  Exxon.  Don't look down.  Nope.  Was the number one company in the world for a long time.  In the whole world.  And now I think they're third or fourth.  Oh, my goodness.  They dropped down a few places.  Not only did they lose...  IBM.  IBM is, if I'm not mistaken, number two, believe it or not.  Oh.  Why is IBM number two? 
[01:39:30]  For what?  I don't know.  That sounds like an old company now.  Yeah.  I don't think IBM is number two.  Vandelay Industries.  Vandelay Industries.  I heard IBM number two, Sam Roberts.  Oh, this is...  And latex.  Don't make me look like a fool.  You look down.  You look down.  No, I was looking at other things.  No one has it.  No one has it.  They really don't have it.  No.  It's a treat.  It's a treat?  Mm-hmm.  McDonald's?  It's a company that makes a treat. 
[01:40:00]  All those Burger King fries are a bust.  They're still shitty for you.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  What, 40% less fat and...  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  They're still shitty for you.  Satisfries, they're calling them.  Yeah.  Are you...  Apple is named most innovative company.  Oh, boy.  No.  Number one company in the world.  They were named number one company in the world in 2011.  Wow.  What is this one, then?  I think this is the most innovative...  Because in 2011, they were named number one company in the world, and they beat out Exxon. 
[01:40:30]  Oh.  Exxon.  So what is this poll, then?  I get...  The news that I'm reading is global execs have named Apple the most innovative company.  Number one brand in the UK?  No.  This is in the world.  So the most innovative company in the world is now Apple?  That's what some global executives say, yeah.  Yeah, that sounds like the fucking artist of the Millennium Award right there.  Is IBM two?  Hmm. 
[01:41:00]  I don't think there's a number two.  No, there's a number two.  And then the company that used to be number one is either third or fourth.  It's third.  Oh, Travis knows.  They make treats?  Of course they know.  Is IBM number two?  Uh, no.  What's number two?  Let me see.  They make things you eat?  Uh, Google.  Oh, Google's number two.  IBM's number three.  They make things you eat?  IBM's number four?  Yes.  Oh.  The mystery company is number three.  Is it Things You Eat? 
[01:41:30]  It's the most valuable brands.  Most valuable brands.  Yes.  That was close.  Oh.  You gotta...  Yeah, there...  You gotta highlight the newspaper article next time.  I was tired.  I know.  You know.  There's 1010 wins.  I just woke up.  I'm suffering from seasonal allergies.  He gets seasonal allergies.  Isn't that crazy thing that bought Hostess?  What?  The, uh...  What's that company?  The Toast People?  Yeah.  The Bimbos?  The Bimbos?  Is it Bimbos?  It's not Bimbos.  Bimbos.  It's something...  Well, this will give it away.  It's...  They make treats.  They make treats.  They make a nice treat. 
[01:42:00]  Lots of treats.  So it's edible.  Oh, yeah.  Treats.  E-Rock would love this company.  Um...  Mmm.  Wow, this is...  I'm boggled.  They've never been not number one.  That's right.  That's why it's a big deal.  And now they're number three.  Yeah.  Coca-Cola?  Maybe.  That is correct.  Ah! 
[01:42:30]  Well.  Coca-Cola has dropped for the first time ever,  and Apple is now the most innovative company in the world.  Damn!  IBM was number...  Number two is the Google?  Number two, yeah.  Apple, Coca-Cola...  Uh...  Apple, Google, Coca-Cola.  IBM drops from four to number three.  Where does PepsiCo come in?  This isn't my first time at the rodeo, boys!  But what does Coca-Cola make besides the soda?  They make other shit.  Oh, yeah.  Coca-Cola is huge.  The Microsoft is five still.  Then you got the General Electric. 
[01:43:00]  Then you got the McDonald's.  GE used to be huge.  Samsung is up there.  Wow.  Number eight for Samsung.  Intel.  Oh, Intel was the...  Okay, yeah.  Samsung, then Intel.  Excuse me.  Sirius XM?  Then Toyota.  Sirius XM satellite radio?  No?  Not up there?  It's the exact same list as last year,  just scattered a little bit differently.  Yeah.  It's the same...  Yeah.  You know, they fool.  It's all the same good old boys.  You can't make Stairway to Heaven number one every year.  You got to fool around a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  I wish Mike Harrison would read this list.  You got to move Freebird into that spot every once in a while, 
[01:43:30]  just to change it up and make people go,  oh, my God, can you believe it?  Yeah.  Where does Cramerica come into play there?  I'm not seeing...  I hear they're trying to come up with a bladder system for oil tankers.  Is that right?  So that if they get a hole in the oil tanker, it contains the oil.  Ketchup and mustard in the same bottle.  That's another thing they're working on.  Cramerica.  Is that the same company responsible for the wider highway lanes?  Well, yeah, you know, a subsidiary thereof. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, this is so luxurious.  I'm sure it is.  There's so much shit land in America.  Why can't we make our highways wider?  Oh, this is so nice.  I would love an 18-lane highway.  Look, people are on the highway, right?  By the time you make it all the way to the left,  there's got to be less assholes.  But people are on highways right now, right?  And they're probably in traffic because we're looking at 8 o'clock on the East Coast.  Look to your right right now.  That's just shit.  That's just shit land.  What is that?  Make that another lane. 
[01:44:30]  More lanes.  There's no houses right next to the fucking highway.  I mean, in most cases, no.  So you're not advocating for the wider lanes.  Well, you know what?  Maybe.  Like turning a four-lane highway into a two-lane highway.  When you really think about how close together you get with all these cars on a daily basis,  it's a little frightening.  It's like, hey, I'm doing like 80 miles an hour,  and I'm pretty much just a couple of feet away from the next guy.  It's amazing these things don't bump into each other a little more often.  I don't feel like trusting my fellow man anymore. 
[01:45:00]  You ever fucking, your closing velocity on a fucking road is like 80 miles an hour if you're both doing 40?  Sure.  And it's one lane one way, one lane the other way.  Right.  And paint.  Right.  That's the only thing separating you.  Yeah.  From the other guy deciding at the last minute he's going to turn into your fucking.  Yeah.  We're very trusting with these machines.  I don't understand why we didn't like, you know, fix that.  Yeah.  It made sense when things were going 10 miles an hour.  Right.  Get a little bump in every once in a while.  But you're right. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  And then they make the roads curvy still.  Yeah.  Curvy roads.  Curvy roads with cars coming right at you.  That's the dumbest thing ever.  Every road should just be straight.  Point A, point B.  Fuck yeah.  Straight fucking road.  Fuck yeah.  You look from space, it looks like the fucking Borg.  Mm-hmm.  That's what I say.  Do it that way.  I guess they're working out the automatically driving, self-driving cars.  That would be really cool.  I think they have.  Like they figured that shit out and it's fucking, they're, they're, they're actually marketing. 
[01:46:00]  But how?  These things.  I don't know.  Magnets?  No, I don't think they're inlaying things in the street yet.  They have them in, what, California?  Um, yeah, GPS.  Mm-hmm.  They, they give in a man GPS.  Yeah, they, they, they use GPS.  Um, I guess other shit too.  But what if a car's coming right at you?  Cameras.  There's cameras, sensors.  Yeah, magnets too, probably.  Magnets.  But what if a car's coming right at you? 
[01:46:30]  Then what does your car do?  I guess it swerves out of the way.  It reads the, the roads, swerves out of the way, steps on the brake, whatever.  Just, it does probably what you would do, maybe.  I don't know.  That's what I'm wondering.  Mm-hmm.  What if there's no room to swerve out of the way?  Because it, it, it's deemed as a car right next to you.  Well, what would you do then in that situation?  I'd probably jam on the brakes.  Then it would jam on the brakes.  I'd probably go faster.  Well then, no, I would go faster.  Probably make a sharp left turn. 
[01:47:00]  That would be crazy.  Well, there's some options there is what I'm saying.  Yeah, but I think that, I think the computer assesses the situation in a split second.  Right.  Assesses all the options and follows through with the best option, whereas you would be  like, oh, what do I do?  You can't even assess the situation that quickly.  I mean, that sounds like a great idea, but the problem is that they're going to have to  go the speed limit, though.  I would if it becomes, oh yeah. 
[01:47:30]  But you can't have a self-driving car and do your 80 miles an hour.  You're 75 to 80.  But you could probably-  When you got those long fucking, you know, road trips, that's, that would suck.  I bet they, uh, you turn them off then and you want to fucking go fast and do shit like  that.  But if you're just driving-  Why is it self-driving at that point?  This is a real question.  Probably not.  Instead of the goofball shit I've been doing.  I bet it won't break the law.  I bet it won't fucking drive fast.  That's why it sucks.  But then you turn it off.  Manual override.  But then, then, like, all right. 
[01:48:00]  Ow.  It's something.  In my dumb world, I did the, uh, Long Island to Buffalo trip more times than I could count.  Or, you know, Rochester as well.  So that whole Western New York thing.  Yeah.  And, and the beauty of that is it's open road.  There's no one around.  So you're going 75, 80 miles an hour to get there a hell of a lot faster.  Yeah.  So now you got the self-driving car because you don't want to do the six, seven hour ride.  But now they're going to fucking force you to do the speed limit, right?  But who cares if you could just lay your seat back and go to sleep?  There's no way I would trust my car to take a nap. 
[01:48:30]  Can you imagine going to sleep?  Something.  That'd be hilarious.  You're just fucking, all right, I'm just going to go to sleep.  And then the sleep, so the other thing, when someone else is driving.  Yeah.  Can you sleep?  Uh, yeah, I've done that before.  I have to be really tired because as soon as I close my eyes and my brain starts fading  away slightly into the sleep world, I'm convinced that the driver is now sleeping.  I'm convinced like some horrific thing is happening that they can't control.  Yeah.  It's the worst. 
[01:49:00]  I can't sleep in cars.  I can sleep anywhere.  I got to be exhausted and then I can.  I'm the sleepmeister general.  Cause so many people like, I had to go out to, I had to go out east for some shit last  week and I was lucky enough to have a driver and the person I was with is like, we got  a lot of stuff to do today.  So, you know, I know you just got off work.  So you just take a nap.  As soon as I tried, I was convinced like the, the, the, the, I had a whole backstory.  The driver stayed up all night.  He's still drunk. 
[01:49:30]  He did drugs.  So I couldn't sleep.  See, but the thing is on a, on a, maybe a daily basis in New York city, if you're in  New York city, you hop in a car with who is amongst the worst drivers I've ever seen  your, your New York city cabbie.  Yeah.  But because they're in a cab, you just assume they're good.  They're okay.  Drivers.  You just decide to trust your life.  We're a complete fucking stranger.  I was in a cab last night.  Yeah.  But that might have a shitty life going on and decided that day is the day he's going  to take him himself and everybody else out. 
[01:50:00]  You don't know this person, but you'll jump in his car.  Like, like it's nothing.  Last night, a guy was doing, he was doing fucking like 80 down, uh, central park West.  And I'm just like, Jesus Christ.  But no one ever says anything.  They drive like assholes.  They they're horrid drivers.  A lot of these cab drivers, but you just get in.  What is it?  You don't know this guy from a hole in the wall and you're like, Hey, drive me.  Right.  This guy has a crash warning system on his, wait, I got to go to this.  This guy, this shit's really going down, huh? 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on boys?  Hey man.  Yeah.  I drive a 18 wheeler and I drive chemical tankers and, uh, on these new trucks they have  on there, what they call a crash warning system or a crash sensor system.  And it's a radar and it's on the front of my truck in the bumper.  And whenever I get too close to a car, maybe one's going slower than me, it will not only  start beeping, but if I get too close, it will actually slow my truck down.  And if I'm not paying attention where I can override the system by having my foot on the 
[01:51:00]  pedal, it will actually throw the brakes on and the jake brakes on and just about throw  me through the windshield.  If somebody was to pull over in front of me and hit their brakes.  Wow.  Damn.  Yeah.  So it's, it, it, it makes me really be more spiked.  If you're in front of me and you're going to turn and I'm behind you, say 50, 60 feet.  If once you turn and you're tailing of your car kind of get sideways to my radar, if I'm  too close, even with my foot on the pedal, it will throw on my brakes and actually almost 
[01:51:30]  stop me.  All right.  Here's the other problem with that, because we all drive a little too close to the cars  in front of us.  So with this new technology, I bet you it's breaking your, your truck way sooner than you  would.  Right.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  That would be annoying.  Not if you're snoozing.  You're riding behind somebody, you know, they're turning.  So you don't slow down because you know, they're going to make the turn.  Right.  Well, before you get there, well, then my truck, if I get too close and do that, it will actually 
[01:52:00]  throw my brakes on it, it will, it scares the hell out of you the first time it happens.  Did you fucking know?  What's the question that in the driver's test?  It's like, if you're going 60 miles an hour, then you have to have six car lengths between  you and the car in front of you.  Right.  And that's what the technology would follow, I would assume.  So now you're like five car lengths in back of the car in front of you, it's going to  start breaking.  Here's what happens.  That'd be a pain in the ass.  If you leave six car lengths between you and the car in front of you, five cars are 
[01:52:30]  going to cut in on you.  Of course.  It's fucking ridiculous.  That's where this technology will fuck you up.  Yeah.  That's what happens to me.  When I leave enough room between me and the car in front of me so my system doesn't activate,  right, sure enough, especially when I'm up there around y'all and you're part of the  country, people jump in front of me and of course it just, I have to just back off  and then, you know, I get clogged up or I get, my system activates and of course all  that's recorded and they ask me, well, why were you so close to that car and why did 
[01:53:00]  your system activate and then you got to go through the BS?  Well, somebody jumped in front of them and, you know, and all that.  So it's, it's a real pain in the butt.  I think it's pretty cool, but I think they got to work out a few, a few of those bugs.  Well, this is another problem I've been having with this about, I've had this for two years  now, or no, excuse me, one year, at midnight one time going through Texas, nobody around  me whatsoever.  I'm in the middle of nowhere on the interstate and I'm cruising along, my foot's off the gas  pedal, I'm not worried about it.  All of a sudden, I think a bug or something went in front of it and my jake brakes and 
[01:53:30]  my brakes applied to my truck and I mean, I was up against the steering wheel, it threw  me up against the steering wheel.  I mean, it just happened for like a second, but it was enough to, you know, mess you up.  Was it a bug or was it an animal on the road?  It doesn't sound like a bug would do that.  Well, I told you, but there was no animal in front of me.  I mean, I was sitting there just cruising along, you know, listening to the radio, you  know, watching down the road.  I didn't see anything.  Right.  If it hits the little radar sensor, it fucking... 
[01:54:00]  That auto braking is scary.  They don't have that figured out, man.  That's what I said.  And when I got this truck, nobody informed me that it was even on here.  Nobody told me how it worked.  Nobody told me nothing.  I just got this truck and they said, I said, well, what's this?  They said, oh, that's your...  They call it a collision safety system.  I call it a crash warning system.  It's from OnGuard.  And...  I call it a Kajer blade.  Sure.  Remember the...  Remember that brake fucking technology they finally had to do away with? 
[01:54:30]  With the anti-lock braking.  The anti-lock brakes.  They still have, but they figured it out.  But no one knew how to use that when it first hit.  Because when you're supposed to tap...  Your brake pedal would go like...  But no one taps when...  Don, don, don, don, don, don.  But yeah, it would just...  Yeah, exactly.  And it felt fucked up so you'd take your foot off the brake.  Exactly.  You're supposed to keep it on.  Which go against what it was meant to do?  Yes.  That was so fucking confusing.  All right.  If the cabs in New York had this system on their cars, they would actually... 
[01:55:00]  Because if my mom has it on her Toyota minivan, actually, if they had to require these cabs  to have this system, they'd probably be a lot less, you know, wrecks and stuff because  they'd be more scared to get up behind somebody.  I see that the technology could be great, but it seems like it's a little buggy still.  Yeah.  All right.  It is.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let me go to Roger in Ohio.  Roger.  Yeah.  I've got the OnGuard system in my truck, and it will pick up bridges, other trucks that 
[01:55:30]  are beside you, and it'll slam on the brakes when it picks these things up at 70 mile an  hour.  Jeez.  Wow.  This doesn't sound like they have that down yet.  No, not quite.  I've tried to have it adjusted three different times, and it gets a little better every time  they adjust it, but it'll still pick up.  It likes to pick up tanker trucks when they pass you at big bridges.  Oh, so if something's going, you know, in front of you from above, it'll pick that up 
[01:56:00]  sometimes?  Yeah.  From above, it'll pick them up occasionally, and it's not regular so that you can be prepared  for it by putting your foot on the pedal.  It's just every once in a while, you'll go under a bridge, and it'll try to throw you  into the windshield.  Oh, my God.  Shit, that's crazy.  You know, you go down the road, you're doing 70 mile an hour, a tanky truck comes around  you, it gets halfway around you, and it slams on the brakes. 
[01:56:30]  They should just come up with a road that only these self-driving cars could use.  Yeah.  How cool would that be?  That would be pretty fucking cool.  And then you know everyone's got the car, and then it's a no-brainer, and nothing could  possibly go wrong.  And then at that point, they probably could have raised the speed limit.  Take the humans out of the fucking equation.  Right.  Right.  How fucked up would it be to hop in your car, just fucking put in a destination and go  to sleep?  That would be...  And then you wake up, and you're fucking there. 
[01:57:00]  That would be amazing.  All right.  That really would be cool.  And then wouldn't you be able to just get fucking hammered drunk and just, like, fucking  set the car?  Why not, right?  Can't get a D-Wee.  It's like, I wasn't driving.  This guy's talking about the Infiniti G50.  What's up, Toby in Utah?  Hey, you have a G50...  Toby Wong?  Toby Wong.  By the way, a lot of...  Toby Chang?  Yeah.  Fucking Charlie Chan.  I deliver these things for Nissan, and the G50 is going to be the car Nissan is using to  do it, and they use lane departure at the yellow lines in correlation with the... 
[01:57:30]  GPS, and you have to be sitting in the seat, the left seat, for the thing to work.  It doesn't completely work on its own yet, but that is the car they are going to use to  do it.  Hmm.  So, check it out.  Well.  That sounds fascinating.  The future.  Very futuristic.  Self-driving cars are right around the corner.  They say that in, like, the 40s.  Right.  Soon, we'll be buzzing down the highways in self-driving automobiles.  The newest radar technology. 
[01:58:00]  It's got, like, fucking big radar dish on the roof, spinning around.  For a goof, we're going to have a broad in on the discussion here.  Ah, this ought to be cute.  This is going to be very cute.  Aw.  What's up, Lisa?  Hi, guys.  Hi, broad.  What do you know about driving?  Well...  What are you going to tell us about?  Self-cooking ovens?  Right.  What are you going to tell us how to put your makeup on while you're driving your car? 
[01:58:30]  The new self-washing dishwasher.  Right.  Ah, you broads.  Ah, you silly broads.  You're driving.  Go ahead.  Get in the kitchen and bake me a pie.  Good.  Talk about technology and machines.  This should be cute.  Oh, that's horrible.  Aw.  Okay.  I have this on my car.  This crash warning system, and you can adjust it where, depending on, you know, you can adjust  the car lengths.  But it will sometimes if you're going, like, under an overpass, no other cars around, it'll 
[01:59:00]  throw on the brakes.  Wow.  And another thing it's got that I turn off, I don't use at all, it's got this thing where  if you switch lanes, but you don't activate your signal, it'll start going off then, too.  But I don't use that.  Oh.  That guy's great.  Does that push your boobies into the steering wheel?  Oh.  Those big, firm boobies.  Does it step on the brakes if you pass a hunk of a guy with nice buns?  I wish. 
[01:59:30]  I wish.  I wish.  I wish.  Oh.  God, I love the accents around America.  I break for garage sales.  What?  Do you break for antique and yard sales?  Oh.  No.  I don't do that stuff.  Oh.  All right.  All right.  Well, that's adorable.  I'm sure everything she said is wrong because it's a girl.  I know.  What are you going to do?  I don't know.  Just humor them.  You guys are lucky you can vote.  Really? 
[02:00:00]  All right, Lisa.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Let's go to Bill and Indy.  Hello, Bill.  What's up, Bill?  Hey, guys.  How's it going this morning?  I got seasonal allergies and I didn't eat the Lucky Charms on one weekend.  There's your update.  Hey, I drive a 2008 Acura TL, so when I get it to work on in the shop, they give me a loaner.  So they gave me a brand new 2014 MDX, and this thing has some new bells and safety mechanisms on it.  It was just so pissed at me because I drive like an asshole. 
[02:00:30]  I got so close to people, it would automatically brake for me.  It would let me know if I was veering out of the lane.  Whenever I cut in front of somebody to get into traffic, it would automatically hit the brake.  There's all these warnings that go off.  It just was not happy with the way I was driving.  Oh.  Well, how did it work, though?  Did it work?  It worked great.  You know, it's funny.  The day I got it, I had to drive two hours out to Dayton, Ohio and back, and it really, by the time I got back, I was like, I'm tired of this thing beeping at me. 
[02:01:00]  Why did he have to say that?  What did he say?  Wait, where were you?  Dayton, Ohio.  Dayton, Ohio?  What the hell happened there?  Nothing.  Just a factory that we have over there.  Oh.  Poor Travis.  I'm not paying attention.  It's like D-Rock.  What?  Wait, Dayton, Ohio?  That sounds very familiar.  What goes on in Dayton?  Some 18 years ago, I was Dayton, Ohio.  Oh, he did.  With two very bad knees. 
[02:01:30]  I was late, guys.  And a dream to become a Major League Baseball player.  I don't think it happened.  Spoiler.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Don't tell me what happened.  I think God, the dream came true.  Oh, I thought it didn't.  All right.  Whiny fucks out of Dayton.  Shane in Ohio, our whole discussion is about what you're about to say.  All.  Sir?  Go ahead, Shane.  Yeah, I've got that sensor system on the front of my big rig. 
[02:02:00]  Right.  And it'll go off when you get about four to five seconds in front of a car, and it'll count down and slow you down as well.  But the whole thing, if you keep your foot on the pedal, it overrides that system.  Pretty much makes it null and void.  I know, but that's what I'm talking about.  I mean, if you're going to have the system, you want it to work for your advantage.  So if you're on the gas pedal, it overrides the auto braking? 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  That seems silly.  Yeah, then why have it at all?  What I'm saying is this seems like cool technology, like Ant's saying.  Imagine, like, really barely paying attention because they've got this shit figured out.  But it sounds like they don't really have it figured out, so then you would override it.  Right.  But then you might as well not have the thing.  Yeah.  I mean, when you're cruising down the interstate at 65 and somebody passes and cuts in front of you within that five-second range,  it becomes a pain in the ass because the truck will slow itself down. 
[02:03:00]  Then you've got to get back up to speed.  Right.  And when you're loaded with 40,000 pounds, it takes a little bit to get back up.  Right.  So you just keep your foot on the pedal, and it overrides the system and creates less of a headache.  We got a little off topic, too, because we're talking about where the whole fucking car drives itself.  I thought you guys were talking about the...  Nah, we moved into this area, you know.  Yeah.  With the cruise controls and stuff, we understand...  Self-braking. 
[02:03:30]  Cars are getting some really cool fucking shit in them, though.  We're getting there.  I'm looking forward to it.  Thank you, Shane.  I think the 2015 Escalade.  There's a lot of mystery behind what it's going to be.  I think the body style's changing, the electronics inside.  So I've always been pretty fucking disappointed with the lack of, like, real cool instrumentation and gadgetry inside it.  You know, all these other cars have great fucking shit.  You pay through the nose for an Escalade, and it's like, oh, thanks for the nav system. 
[02:04:00]  And that's pretty much it.  I was in the brand new Land Rover.  How's that?  One of our pals is driving one around right now.  Oh.  The thing's not even out yet.  Is it nice?  Holy fuck.  Is it nice?  Yeah?  Mm.  It's like, I think it was 130 Gs or something like that.  Wow.  This thing was rich.  Jesus.  Ridiculous.  It's a lot of cake.  It looked really nice, too, man.  A lot of cashage.  I got to get a new car.  Yeah.  I don't know what to get.  I need, like, a bigger...  I need, like, a bigger SUV. 
[02:04:30]  Well, I've got to tell you, Escalades.  They're pretty big, though.  They're pretty nice.  It's being revealed next week.  Next week, yeah.  October 7th.  But why hasn't anyone revealed it?  They're in the factory right now.  Why isn't anyone talking?  There's a release date.  They want to, like, you know, make a big deal of it.  Yeah, but they have disgruntled workers like anywhere else.  Why isn't one of those guys going, well, here it is.  Here's a picture of it.  Well, they keep it all camouflaged, too.  Like, when they take it out on the test tracks,  they paint it in these weird patterns 
[02:05:00]  so you can't really see body lines  so that when car and driver guys  take the telephoto lens and take pictures,  you can't really make out the body style and shit.  Come on.  Seriously?  No kidding, man.  Yeah, I'm looking at a photo right now.  Yeah, they painted it like a kaleidoscope kind of a thing  and with weird bent lines and...  Yeah, but can't you color that shit in  after you get your picture taken?  Maybe, but you can't see the body lines.  And then they cover up the grill with, like, this big,  like, you know, one of those bra things  that they put on the thing.  They cover up the front. 
[02:05:30]  They don't want you seeing.  Wow.  Can you show me the picture?  Yeah.  Yeah, they do things like to screw up the body lines  so you can't really get a good grasp of what it looks like.  But I hear it's supposed to be pretty cool.  See, like that.  All right, you can kind of figure it out, though.  Well, you can, but it makes it that much more difficult.  It kind of looks...  Doesn't it just look like a block?  Yeah, I guess.  Like a big block.  I guess.  Yeah.  That's pretty cool, though.  Yeah, I'm more interested in what they're going to put inside 
[02:06:00]  and as far as the electronics go and all the gadgetry.  I want gadgets!  Like a good gadget.  I just want a bigger car.  Yeah?  A little bigger, but not too crazy  where I can't get into some of these parking spots  in New York City.  Get a Hummer.  What happened to the Hummers?  They were all the rage for a little while,  and then, like, you don't even see one on the road anymore.  Yeah, yeah.  They don't make them anymore.  Really?  But you don't even see, like, the old ones.  We got one in our neighborhood. 
[02:06:30]  Do you?  Yeah, just, you know,  someone that has to just fucking be an asshole.  Yeah.  That just says asshole.  They tried with the H2 to make it a little more subtle,  but the original Humvee that, like, Arnold made famous  because he bought one.  No, we got an H2 in our neighborhood.  It's crazy.  You just know the person that drives that is an asshole.  It's a bright yellow one.  One of the stations we had,  one of the stations we were at when we were syndicated  had one as a station vehicle. 
[02:07:00]  I remember that.  Remember that?  Yeah, I do.  And we were in it, and it was fucking pretty cool.  I don't remember what city.  I don't know.  Back in the glory days.  Right.  Yeah, like that.  What are you going to do with that?  You just look like a jerk.  Driving a military vehicle.  Right.  Why?  When gas prices started going up,  all these giant, absurd cars became...  That's what happened.  Yeah.  Yet the Escalade still sells.  They do well.  But they use them a lot.  I think a lot of it is, like, cabs and limo services and shit. 
[02:07:30]  People love it.  Rap Stars.  What about the Suburban?  Should I get a little Suburban action?  The Suburban.  Should I make a smaller Suburban?  I don't know.  You should get a Range Rover.  Sub Suburban?  Range Rover.  Range Rover.  Range Rover.  That's the shit.  Oh, boy.  If I had money, I'd have a Range Rover.  You'll never have a Range Rover.  Why?  I'm just assuming you'll probably never have money.  How come?  Eh, it won't be successful.  Range Rover. 
[02:08:00]  There it is.  Oh, boy.  Whoa, that's kind of rap looking.  I bet the black people like that.  Well, Range Rovers are expensive.  So, yes, black people do like that.  Oh, boy.  They love expensive things.  Yeah, you got to get a Range Rover, dude.  Range Rover?  If you're going to be a millionaire.  What's that?  I'm sorry.  They're $130,000 fucking dollars.  Yeah, dude.  Fucking righteous.  Yeah, Range Rover's the way to go.  Range Rover?  It does look nice.  Can we play the E-Rock song? 
[02:08:30]  The Dickie Goodman thing?  Oh.  Oh, wait, no.  We got to play George Briden to break.  That's right.  We're looking for E-Rock Dickie Goodman songs.  You know, the old Dickie Goodman.  We could play this.  Hello, Mr. Jaws.  Well, that's so bad.  Maybe I was in a Range Rover, not a Land Rover.  Could have been a Range Rover.  When I said Land Rover?  Land Rover.  What does a Land Rover look like?  Are they boxy?  Yeah, I think they're boxy.  Yeah, I mean, they're made by Range Rover. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah?  The same people?  Oh, yeah, I think so.  Well, that's more, you know, you're out in the outback.  That's a Land Rover, yeah.  But you got to get a Range Rover.  You're not a Land Rover.  Range Rover greater than the Land Rover?  Yeah, Range Rover.  All right, then I was in a Range Rover.  Yeah, get that Range Rover.  I was in the brand new Range Rover.  That thing was ridiculous.  But it was $130,000, Sam Roberts.  That's why you could say chilling in the range.  Like, you can't be like, I was chilling in my Grand Cherokee.  Is that what they say?  Yeah.  I don't feel like being carjacked. 
[02:09:30]  That's true, too.  Yeah, you're going to be carjacked.  That says carjacked all over it.  They might as well just have a fucking decal on the side.  Yep.  Fucking cracker-ass cracker caught slipping.  That's why when I get a brand new car, I put that first dent in right away.  Yeah?  Oh, God.  By hitting a black person?  You just got to fucking ding it up a little bit.  Oh.  And then you don't lose sleep at night worrying about that shit.  I hate the first ding on a new vehicle.  That's why you do it yourself.  I love it, Dan. 
[02:10:00]  Do it over with.  I'm telling you.  It's the greatest thing you can do for yourself.  The first new vehicle I ever bought in my life was that fucking Thunderbird in Boston.  I thought it was a jet ski.  It was a jet ski.  It was.  A Sea-Doo.  It was up in Massachusetts, and I was driving back to New York with it.  And I stopped at one of the rest stops, McDonald's area and shit.  And I came out, and the person that parked next to me just must have flung the door open.  Right there in the middle of my driver's door.  Bink!  I came out. 
[02:10:30]  I'm like, you mother fucker.  Oh, I'm so pissed.  Were they gone?  Of course they were gone.  Of course.  Bastards.  People just suck.  I know.  All right.  We can play the E-Rock, or we can play George Brett.  What do you want to do?  Well, we can play the E-Rock into George Brett.  That wastes a lot of our material.  Yeah.  Well, we could do E-Rock now, George Brett next break.  I want to be able to, like...  Why don't we do E-Rock next break so you guys can talk about it? 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, we got to talk about E-Rock.  Because then, if we talk about it, then we'll get more Dickie Goodman songs.  Exactly.  And maybe we can try to call E-Rock's hotel.  Oh, you know his hotel?  Travis said he might.  Really?  Oh, I hope so.  What?  I hope so.  Yeah.  Just because I don't know if E-Rock's heard this or not, and I would love to find out.  Oh, yeah.  Good, good.  Okay.  So, George Brett, it was 21 years ago today that he got his 3,000th hit.  The only reason we mention that is so he could play this, the George Brett shit story. 
[02:11:30]  Right side.  Back to the right, gentlemen.  Both hands.  Right side.  I shit my pants last night.  I did.  Went out and had a great meal.  Just a great fucking meal.  I had to go to the bathroom so bad in the car, I'm going, travel, hurry up, man.  I got to shit.  I had fucking shit in my pants.  I'm good twice a year for that.  When was the last time you shit your pants?  Yeah. 
[02:12:00]  Been a while?  It's been a while.  I was in Vegas a couple years ago.  Just an honest to God, true story.  Staying with Bellagio.  I went over to Mirage for dinner, met some friends of mine over there.  Went to Kokomo's, a great little steakhouse.  The guy brings out some fresh crab legs.  He just came in, I got to give them to you guys.  I'm eating them.  Then we go play gamble a little bit.  I had a tea time early in the morning.  So I said, look, I got to get going.  I'm walking back to the hotel.  I get three quarters of the way out of the lobby and all of a sudden I go, oh, fuck. 
[02:12:30]  And I'm standing here like this.  I got my butt pinched so fucking, I'm fucked, I can't move.  All of a sudden, you know, felt all right.  I went just like this.  Water.  I had some food poisoning from the crabs.  Take off my leather jacket.  Tied it around my waist.  I'm just standing there and it's just running down my leg.  I got jeans on, black bucks, no socks.  And I just start fucking walking. 
[02:13:00]  Every time I'm walking, something's coming out.  It's water.  Straight fucking water.  Then, just tell you how sick I was.  Tell you how sick I was.  Then I'm standing outside and I got on my cell phone and I called the guy.  I said, Larry, you won't believe this.  I'm standing outside the fucking Bellagio.  I can't move.  I got shit everywhere.  I shit all over myself.  And Larry's about a 48 waist.  So he brings me over a pair of pants and some towels and some towels.  And so then he comes over and he meets me.  I tell him where I'm standing. 
[02:13:30]  He finds the closest bathroom.  When you go up the escalator, you go into the fuck.  I can't get in the elevator.  It's 12 o'clock at night.  So he goes in and he finds the closest bathroom in the lobby of the hotel.  And then I get in the escalator and he kind of pretends like he dropped something so no one gets behind me.  Tells me where it is.  I go in there.  He goes and gets the towel all wet for me.  Throws it over the fucking stall.  I take off all my fucking clothes.  Just wipe off.  Leave my shoes.  Left my shoes, my pants, everything right there.  The towels right there in the stall. 
[02:14:00]  And I'm walking barefoot with my shirt and his pants that are 48 waist through the lobby like this.  It's midnight.  Got up in the morning.  Took the most perfect double tapered shit I've ever had in my life.  True story.  Who's the pitchers in this game?  We'll return after these messages.  Nobody is supposed to touch your private parts.  Don't touch me like that.  Don't touch me like that. 
[02:14:30]  No.  Nobody is supposed to touch your private parts.  You know I really like you.  But I don't like the way you touch me.  Touch me.  Touch me.  No.  Touch me.  Touch me.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Touch me.  No.  Do you ever hear anything like this?  This?  This?  This?  Anus.  This is a useful thing indeed. 
[02:15:00]  We all have an anus.  All have an anus.  Remember that anus is the proper word.  Anus.  Give relief in time of need.  We all have an anus.  All have an anus.  Penis.  No.  Vulva.  Vulva.  Vulva.  Vulva.  Is what girls have down below.  Vulva.  Vulva. 
[02:15:30]  When she's naked it will show.  When she's naked it will show.  Penis.  Penis.  Here's what boys have down in front.  Penis.  Most people call it vagina.  Some children call it Virginia.  Nobody is supposed to touch your private parts.  Nobody is supposed to touch your private parts. 
[02:16:00]  No.  No.  Oh, stop.  If you don't, I'm going to tell my dad.  Touch it. 
[02:16:30]  No.  Touch it.  Stop it.  Touch it.  No.  Touch it.  Period.  Nobody is supposed to touch your private porch.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah, this is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Sure is.  That little production piece by Troy Kwan. 
[02:17:00]  Did a great job with it, by the way.  Should have him come in and talk to us.  It's not a bad idea.  I want to know what goes behind any production piece.  No, no, no.  It's a boring story.  Are you sure?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He just kind of put it together.  People like that inside radio stuff.  Yeah, they don't like it as much.  He just put it together.  If someone doesn't like it, maybe they can debate it on the air here.  Go back and forth a little.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  That would be fun.  We got too much stuff to do.  Oh, strange.  Can I go first? 
[02:17:30]  Oh, yeah, go ahead.  And then we go to that.  Sure.  But then we also do the Iraq thing.  Oh, yeah.  Last night I had a discussion with my young son on how to adjust his penis.  Ah.  Now, what would bring that up?  He's growing up.  Oh.  We're watching TV late last night.  And he goes, Daddy, my penis hurts.  Uh-oh.  And it hurt because he's having one of those, you know, boners. 
[02:18:00]  Jesus Christ.  An erection.  He's having one of those baby boners.  Oh, man.  Not that he's a baby.  Well, he's still baby-ish.  Oh, yeah.  And he doesn't understand that when, you know, when he pops a boner that he has to adjust it.  Oh, you got to get that unobstructed.  Right.  You can't have the pants in the way holding it down.  Oh, he had it off to the side, all willy-nilly, just in an uncomfortable spot.  So I had to, like, explain to him carefully because you never know how this shit's going 
[02:18:30]  to come out down the road.  Jeez.  You got to, like, you know, you got to move it and get it up next to the belly.  It'll sit nice.  Oh, man.  So then he tried it and he goes, oh, it feels much better.  I'm like, all right, there you go.  When that happens, you got to figure out, you know, how to adjust it.  Oh, no.  You got to adjust that shit.  Did you tell him not to do it in, like, you know, public?  Oh, yeah.  We're already-  You can't shove your hand down there, you know. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, God.  We're already having those discussions.  Oh, man.  Making sure.  That's why that production piece is not fun anymore for me.  Ah.  Because you have to have those discussions from an early age, man.  Those little talks.  Yep.  Oh, boy.  And then we were at a diner yesterday because we had some people up.  And at the end, I don't know.  Ah.  So we're about to leave the diner.  And the old man, who, nice enough, but I don't know, seems a little creepy. 
[02:19:30]  He goes, does your son like lollipops?  I go, oh, yeah.  And then he just, without even asking me, he goes, come here, come here, come here.  And then my son, he's still a trusting kid.  Oh, no.  He doesn't understand all this shit yet.  He goes running behind the counter to pick out his lollipop.  And I'm like, that's training him for the creeps on the fucking streets.  Come here, come here.  Because they use that exact same tact, right?  You don't want that.  So I don't know how to handle that one.  I'm confused by that one.  Hmm.  I said on the way out, I'm like, it was okay that time, but make sure it's okay with 
[02:20:00]  mommy and daddy before you go running off to, you know, pick your candy.  Right?  How do you do that?  Don't take candy from strangers.  That's what we always learn.  But this guy, I mean, he has a whole bucket of those dum-dums.  Dum-dum.  He picked out a dum-dum.  Was that cool or not?  Yeah, as long as you told him, you know.  Can't be fucking trusting anybody.  Can't trust anyone.  Especially when they're trying to give you candy. 
[02:20:30]  Right.  Such an old hack thing right there, the candy.  Yeah, but it's tried and true.  Oh.  Kids fall for it like fucking crack.  Oh, my God.  They didn't need to update that one ever.  No.  That one still works like a charm.  My son pissed all over his own face because he didn't point the pee-pee in the right direction.  Can we take one of these?  Sure.  Chris of Rochester, the home of Brother Wheeze.  What's up, Chris?  Morning, boys. 
[02:21:00]  Hey, man.  Home of Jackie, right?  Home of Jackie, you're right.  Who I think is back on the Brother Wheeze show.  Oh, I can't even.  So it all works out in the end.  Why do you even remember her name?  Aw.  Sydney, Jackie, and the dude.  You should have a good Wheeze segment during Jacktober.  I think you'd get a good laugh out of it.  You don't like the Wheeze, huh?  That's too bad.  No, no, no.  I didn't say that.  I do like Wheeze.  It's good.  Prostate talk in the morning is always healthy.  You know what I mean?  I think he's being sarcastic.  Yeah, you don't like the Wheeze.  We get it.  So what do you got there, Chris? 
[02:21:30]  You know, my kid, he's four years old.  He still wears pull-ups when he sleeps at night.  And he's pulling it up at night.  And I got to teach him where to point the pee-pee.  Because it was pulling straight up.  And about five minutes into him falling asleep, he wakes up screaming because he had pissed in his own face and all over the bed.  It was awful.  You know, the boys, I don't know where he gets it.  It must be from his mother because he's got a big one.  And I don't know what to do about it.  His mother's got a big penis?  Yeah.  What do you mean?  She's got what I like to call a Jimmy clit. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, God.  You know what I mean?  It looks like a little four-year-old.  This guy just digs deeper.  Yeah, he really does.  Yeah, yeah.  But he doesn't like Brother Wheeze.  See, it's not easy to do, is it?  He's mad at me.  Yeah, now he's mad at Sam.  I don't know.  All right, Chris.  Good story.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, keep it up, guys.  Love you.  All right.  We will.  We will do just that.  Yeah.  Well, Sal brought something to the show.  Well, it's about time.  Which is pretty amazing. 
[02:22:30]  Where's Sal?  Where's Sal?  Sal.  Sal.  Sal.  That's how Jackie used to say his name.  Sal.  Sal.  Sal.  Jackie used to walk in.  They'd be down there in the intern room and stuff.  Hi, good morning.  Sal.  How about the girl interview?  We purposely did not look at the video ahead of time.  Cool.  So what do you got?  Just my friend showed me this video yesterday.  This guy has all these contraption videos on his YouTube channel, like things that shoot 
[02:23:00]  rubber bands, all that sort of stuff, and this guy shoots his slingshot, and something happens.  What's he shooting with?  What's he shooting out of the slingshot?  I forget.  It's like a little pellet of some sort.  It's like homemade weapons?  Yeah, he has little contraptions and stuff like that.  Yeah, it's a pretty good YouTube channel.  And then, whoa, did this go bad for the guy?  Yeah.  Seriously?  It's really bad.  It looks like one of those.  You know how when you have marbles, there's the one big marble? 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  It looks like he's firing big marbles.  Oh, man.  This is like a crazy slingshot that he makes.  Yeah.  It's like a wrist rocket.  Sal's bringing this to our attention.  We'll put it on our Facebook page.  All right.  Yeah, you can fast forward a little bit.  Fast forward a little bit because he's talking about making it.  Either from the backside or from the top.  So, he's explaining his homemade contraption.  Today's ammo, 20 millimeter steel balls.  Oh, man.  All right.  They're big ball bearings.  As you can see, the slow motion camera.  And on the top of my catch box, we'll put different bottles. 
[02:24:00]  Here we go.  All right.  So.  Whew.  Wow.  All right.  That's pretty fucking strong.  It went right through a plastic water bottle.  Look at that.  The ball is in the bottle.  Next, we'll use a glass bottle.  A glass bottle.  Pretty impressive invention.  Shattered the glass bottle.  Right.  So, now the champagne bottle.  Champagne bottle.  Champagne bottle.  What the fuck happened there? 
[02:24:30]  All right.  It bounced off the wall.  It hit him on the head.  Hello?  Hand weg.  Hand weg.  Hand weg.  Oh, my God.  That's a lot of blood.  So, it ricocheted off the wall.  Wow.  Hit him right above the eyebrows.  Yeah, look.  Leaving a pretty impressive fucking wound.  Oh, it's just gushing blood.  Right.  Huh. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, see this?  Wow.  That was the glass.  Right.  There's the champagne bottle.  I guess he missed it and then it bounced back.  Yeah, there he goes.  Oh, you can see it come right back at his head.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  You can see it when it falls.  I guess the camera falls.  Right.  His head's right there.  And he's bleeding profusely.  He's got a hell of a wound on his head.  Right.  If it probably would have gone, like, maybe two inches lower, it would have hit him right 
[02:25:30]  in the eye.  Really?  That probably would have killed him.  I think if it hit your eye.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's very lucky where it hit him.  Finally bringing something pretty impressive to the show.  Oh, God.  Look at this fucking porn.  Oh, my God.  Is he okay?  Does he have brain damage?  Oh, look at him.  He's alive.  He's alive.  He's alive.  He's sitting up against a wall, all bandaged up with blood everywhere, all over his face,  all over his shirt.  Oh, my God.  He looks like the victim of somebody in, like, a horror movie monster. 
[02:26:00]  Right.  Like fucking Syria.  Right.  Yeah.  He looks like he was in Syria.  Damn.  What do you think, Sal?  Chuck?  Yeah.  I just...  I kind of like watching those gory videos.  Yeah.  You know?  So my friend showed it to me.  I was like, it's one of those things you can't look away, you know?  Of course.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  Yeah.  That's right.  I don't know.  Pretty gullible, are you?  Jesus, Sal.  Is that gullible?  I had a feeling you guys wouldn't like it.  Sal.  No, it's not that we don't like it.  Wait, should I play the follow-up?  Yeah, play the follow-up video. 
[02:26:30]  Because he did make a follow-up.  Online.  Yeah, because everyone wants to know what happened to him.  Yeah, is he okay?  Yes.  Welcome to the Slingshot channel.  Oh, wait a minute.  You see, I'm alive and kicking.  Wait, wait, what?  And in particular, I have no head wound.  Hey.  Of course, the video was a fake.  Oh.  Sorry.  Sal.  Oh, Sal.  You don't even know it was fake?  No, I knew it was fake.  What?  Of course I knew it was fake.  We watched the exact video right afterwards.  You didn't know it was fake.  But you told us that you thought it was just... 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, I know.  I was just trying to have some fun.  That's all.  You're such a lie.  What?  Come on, Sal.  Sal, you...  That's all.  I'm not lying to you guys.  You were trying to prank Opie and Anthony?  Were you pranking us?  I was just trying to...  I was going to show you this afterwards.  No.  I was hoping to say that.  You thought this was real.  When you came in...  No, I knew it was fake.  That would kill the guy instantly.  How does that not break his skull?  No, you said if it was two inches lower and hit him in the eye, it would have killed him  instantly.  Yeah, yeah.  He was pretending that it actually happened. 
[02:27:30]  And he's lucky it didn't happen.  Hit him two inches lower.  Yeah.  Obviously, it didn't kill him.  Sam, what do you think?  Do you think Sal thought it was real?  I'm trying to figure that out either way.  Is he acting?  I wasn't trying to prank you.  I was just trying to...  I was going to show you the making of afterwards.  Well, if you were telling us it was real...  Right.  ...and then you're sitting here watching and commenting that it's real, then you're trying  to prank us.  That's punked.  So you're either trying to punk us...  I'm sorry.  You're either trying to punk us or you got caught and just realized for the first time 
[02:28:00]  that it was fake.  No, I was trying to mess with you guys.  Either way, you don't look good.  I was just trying to play it up a little bit, I suppose.  That's all.  Sorry, guys.  Sorry, everyone.  I don't get Sal.  He's so confusing.  I think...  I think he was had.  And I think he never clicked on that other video.  And now he's trying to cover?  I watched it with my friend yesterday.  I think he's trying to cover.  The cover is kind of worse than the reality.  But in all fairness, I don't know. 
[02:28:30]  Well, here's a good way to tell if he watched it.  What happens in this video?  I don't remember.  My friend just literally...  He skimmed through it.  He just said it was fake afterwards.  That gives it away.  That so gives it away.  Come on.  You can't even tell us what happens in the making of the fake.  He had it.  He was like literally in my living room.  Why wouldn't you watch the making of the fake video?  I was...  Because it was pretty impressive.  Because it looks like...  It sort of looked like the thing was flying right at him. 
[02:29:00]  Right.  So then wouldn't you watch the whole video to see how he pulled it off?  See how he did it.  My friend literally had the same reaction.  He was like, oh, it's fake.  So then he was playing that.  And that was it.  I was working while we were doing this.  It's always a friend.  It's something.  Something.  Friend.  Just out of curiosity, are you trying to get a pool party together for everybody?  Oh, remember that?  That was a lie.  I apologize.  Sorry for bringing this.  You thought it was real, right?  What?  You thought it was real?  When I first watched it yesterday, yes, I did. 
[02:29:30]  But you thought it was real as you were presenting this to us?  No.  I was just trying to play it like bring a little something to the show.  Opie, you're big on body language and human psychology, right?  Tell me what happened.  Like Ant said, I mean, I'm with Ant.  He's really hard to figure out.  He's really strange.  When you pose a question that somebody hears, and then they go, what?  And then they answer it?  I think the part where he goes, if it was two inches lower, it would have killed him.  I gave it away that he thought the whole time this was real. 
[02:30:00]  See, either option is so strange.  It's so weird.  I'm telling you guys the truth.  And we didn't, I know how me and Ant work, and we didn't really work them because we  thought we had enough info to go with the, you got had.  All right, so.  Does that make sense?  Here it is.  Here's the deal.  Sure.  Okay, we think it's real.  Let's say that, that we watched it and thought it was real.  What's your end thing here?  I was going to tell you it was fake and that there's a making of video that I didn't watch.  When were you going to tell us? 
[02:30:30]  Right after, as soon as the video was over.  Then you said, let's watch it again, so we replayed a few seconds of it, and I was going  to tell you, like, right after that, pretty much.  And then what were we going to do?  Like, go, oh.  I don't know.  Just, I don't know.  Whatever.  I don't know.  I told you what happened, and that's it.  I love this.  It's so much fun.  What's the real answer?  I'm telling you the truth.  No, I'm being completely honest.  I don't know, though.  Do you see that?  I don't.  Because, like, okay, so if he's telling the truth now, then the idea was, okay, I got in 
[02:31:00]  deep shit last week, so I'm going to make up for it by playing a trick.  No, it wasn't to be a trick.  It was just to show the video and present it in such a manner.  But we're smarter than that.  I mean, right on the screen, it says, you know, what does it say exactly?  Do you think this is real or fake?  Look here.  In the annotations.  So to us, we were like, okay, obviously it's fake.  In the annotations on the original video, it says, like, think this is fake? 
[02:31:30]  It says it right there.  And the thing when I said he looks like he was a victim of a monster in a horror movie.  Right.  It's because it doesn't look.  It looks like he must have done it a few times because in the video, right at the beginning  of the video, he has, like, fake bloodstains everywhere.  Yeah, we noticed that.  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  So it's obviously fake.  All right.  Then you did a really shitty job trying to prank us.  I wasn't trying to.  I was just trying to bring a little something.  And then how come right now, like, when we were watching it, you winced when he got hit?  You went like, oh, oh, and turned away. 
[02:32:00]  Because it looks pretty convincing.  Were you acting?  I wasn't acting, but it looks very convincing.  It doesn't look convincing at all.  Because the camera would never fall like that, so it's perfectly where his head's in frame.  Yeah, well, obviously, his lady friend or whoever was holding the camera, why would  she fall with it, like, at the exact same time?  Yeah, it makes sense.  Well.  But it just looks pretty convincing when you're watching it.  No.  It's pretty, it's better than most, like, horror films, like, that you see in theaters now.  No.  I disagree.  Acting.  Acting. 
[02:32:30]  So I was acting.  You were acting.  You winced.  No, it was kind of gross.  I turned away and went, oh, man, oh, that was acting.  I don't know, maybe I got caught up in the moment when everyone else was doing their part  of fake reacting to it.  I don't know.  Sorry.  I went along with the crowd a little bit.  I apologize, guys.  Went along with the crowd.  A little peer pressure.  That's all.  Yeah.  All right.  Well.  You're right.  I can't figure this out.  I can't figure him out.  In neither way.  What was your endgame?  That we would be like, oh, my God, and then you would be able to give the big reveal 
[02:33:00]  that it was fake?  And we're like, oh, Sal, you got us.  Sal, you got a million of them.  Damn, Sal tricked us.  Bringing some media to the show.  That's all.  Which I did.  You brought material.  And then, yeah.  In a different way than probably you wanted to, but you certainly brought some material  to the show.  Were you laying in bed last night with your head, your hands behind your head, thinking,  I got him.  Yep, I got this.  I got him with this one.  I got him tomorrow.  I'm going to wait until they start running out of material.  I'll be a hero.  I'm going to be a hero.  I'm going to bring this in and I'll fool them.  And wait until they see how smart I am. 
[02:33:30]  That's real.  Watch out.  Oh, yeah.  That's great.  You really thought it was real?  Good.  The first time I watched it, I did.  Oh, my God.  Did you think it was real when you came in with it today?  No, I knew it wasn't real.  I think for a second did I think that was real.  Right.  When I watched it yesterday, I was fully convinced it was real until my friend said two minutes  later, hey, look, there's a making of video.  It says it right on the screen. 
[02:34:00]  I know.  Even in the annotation, when you're watching the video, it says, think this is fake.  Obviously, it's probably a link to this.  Were you getting hit in the head with balls, too?  No.  At that moment?  No.  With your friend?  Just on the chin.  Just the chin?  And the reason why he had to make...  See, I know how this YouTube works.  Yeah.  If YouTube thought it was real, they would fucking yank the video.  Ah.  That's why he had to do that shit.  And he's got like 300,000 subscribers.  He's not like just a random dude getting hurt.  He's a guy who makes videos to trick people. 
[02:34:30]  YouTube doesn't have bloodshed like that.  They don't allow like crazy shit like that.  Maybe Sal was thinking, that guy tricked me.  Now that I know, I'm going to turn around and trick, though.  B-b-b-boys.  Yeah, because last commercial break, he came in.  It was like, hey, guys.  Yeah.  Have you seen the slingshot video?  He was definitely going for the trick us thing.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  He's 0 for 2 as far as excitedly running in here with stuff. 
[02:35:00]  People are calling you a liar there, Sal.  Oh, that's great.  I'm not really sure.  Oh, Sal.  I'll go work on something else.  I'll go find out where E-Rock is staying right now.  Fizster writes, what would showing you a fake video bring to the show?  It's a great question.  But a little bit of entertainment, that's all.  And then I'm getting slammed now, so that's entertaining the audience.  But that wasn't your endgame.  No, obviously not.  See, that's our endgame.  No, but this is just what it's become at this point.  Remember when Steve was so convinced that that gunshot video was real? 
[02:35:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  He also stuck to his gun.  He did.  He insisted that that was real.  It's real.  And Corey's on the phone from Australia.  I knew that was a different Corey.  Yes.  That's how you executive produce.  And he sat back in his office as we took the Corey phone call.  Oh, was he proud.  And put his feet up right there, and that's how you executive produce.  He literally looked at me in the eyes and pointed at me and said, and that's how you executive produce. 
[02:36:00]  They're on the phone right now with Corey from Australia.  We got to fill the listeners in.  We get new ones all the time.  Oh, was that fun?  That might be a good podcast.  That would probably be a good one.  You got to listen to it first to make sure.  Well, I mean, even without the Steve stuff, that video, his interview is hysterical.  Yeah.  Corey's interview.  Yeah, could you get Corey's interview again?  So this guy, I mean, he was hot for, like, what, two days?  He threw some crazy party.  Yep.  And then Steve thought he had the real guy on the phone, which would have been a huge. 
[02:36:30]  Whoa, it's the real life.  Huge coup for us, man.  Because it was the story of, like, two days.  And what was the big reveal?  The guy finally admitted he wasn't the real Corey, or we were suspicious after we hung up with him?  How did it all play out?  I forget now.  I don't remember.  I remember you thought that you had spoken to Corey.  It wasn't after you hung up on him.  But then I think we did a little further research, and people started sending a few emails.  And by the next day, we realized that that was certainly not the same person. 
[02:37:00]  That's how you executive produced.  And who was the Corey that we got?  Just some guy named Corey in Australia.  Oh, we called him.  Yeah, we called him.  Gotcha.  And he was faking it.  And he decided, fuck it, I'll just fake this shit?  Yes.  Oh, that's great.  Here's the original Corey, the story anyway, which it's absolutely worth playing.  Risky business.  A teenager holds an alcohol-fuelled party for hundreds of kids while his unsuspecting parents  are on holiday.  Holiday.  16-year-old Corey Worthington is now facing not only the wrath of mum and dad, but a $20,000 
[02:37:30]  fine from police.  I spoke to him a short time ago.  Did you?  Corey, thanks for joining us.  The only question that I can think to ask, what were you thinking?  Um, I wasn't really.  Did your parents say you could have a party?  No.  Um, no.  No.  So, why did you?  Um, I don't know, it was just a get-together with a couple of mates at first, and then we  thought we might as well just have a bit of a party, and then it sort of just got out 
[02:38:00]  of hand, and yeah.  Well, 500 people turned up, the air wing of the police force, the dog squad, your neighbour's  cars were being destroyed.  What have your parents had to say, Corey?  Um, I haven't really talked to them, because every time they call, I don't answer.  Because, yeah.  Because, yeah.  So, that's a short-term strategy.  You're going to have to talk to them eventually.  What are you going to say? 
[02:38:30]  Um, sorry.  Are you sorry?  It's a waste.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, I am.  You don't sound very sorry.  Oh, my God.  Well, I can't be exactly blamed for everything that happened, because it wasn't in the house,  it was out in the street, and I didn't do it.  Like, the police said, you stay inside so you don't get in trouble, so I did what he said,  so.  Why don't you take this opportunity now to apologise to your parents and to your neighbours,  who have said today that they were frightened?  Well, I've already offered, like, to say sorry to them and stuff when I see them, so I will 
[02:39:00]  say sorry now for everything that happened.  Why don't you take your glasses off so we can see you, and then apologise to your neighbours  for frightening them?  Nah, nah, I'll leave these on.  Nah, I like them.  They might be fined $20,000.  Are you going to try and pay that for them?  Yeah, but I don't think it's fair they'll be fined it, because what happened, it was my  party, but it could have just been any random person walking in the street doing it. 
[02:39:30]  What happens all the time?  Your parents were out of town.  You put out the invitation.  You started it.  Why don't you make a grown-up decision now and accept responsibility, take off those glasses  and apologise to everybody that you frightened, to the police who were forced to retreat and  whose cars have been damaged, and to the community who have had to pay for this.  Take off your glasses and apologise to us.  I'll say sorry, but I'm not taking off my glasses.  Why not? 
[02:40:00]  Because they're famous.  Because your glasses are famous.  Yeah.  Why are your glasses famous?  I know, everyone likes them, so I don't know, I'm not taking them off.  You're pretty happy with the way you look and the attitude you've got, are you?  Yeah, my parents aren't, but I am.  Okay, Corey, we've got to wrap this up.  What would you say to other kids who were thinking of partying when their parents are out of town?  Get me to do it for you.  Get you to do it for you.  Not don't do it. 
[02:40:30]  Nah, get me to do it for you.  Best party ever so far.  Well, that's what everyone's been saying, so.  Well, we've got to go, but I suggest you go away and take a good, long, hard look at yourself.  I have.  Everyone has.  They love it.  They love it.  They love it.  They love it.  Oh, he's a man.  Yes, that's how you executive produce.  So then we got Corey on the phone, but it was the fake Corey.  Yeah, it was not that Corey.  It wasn't Corey.  And Steve was so happy with himself. 
[02:41:00]  And that was the day that I went back into the office and he was in there.  And while you guys were on the phone with him, he pointed at me and said, and that's how you executive produce.  Boy, did we never let that line go.  Never loved it.  Holy fuck, man.  Thanks, Sal.  No problem.  Yes, thanks for the amazing video.  Amazing slingshot video.  Crazy.  I'll bring something else.  We'll put it up on our Facebook page.  Better next time.  Hey, we got the E-Rock Dickie Goodman song that this guy tweeted a million times over the weekend. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  So we're looking for E-Rock Dickie Goodman songs now, right?  Change it up a little bit.  Sal showed me this cool fucking picture.  It's this helicopter, right?  And he's lowering this fucking diver down.  Yeah.  And a giant shark is jumping out of the water.  Whoa.  Grabbing the guy.  Yeah, yeah.  It's crazy.  Wow.  Sal showed that to me.  Pretty amazing.  He showed me this boss documentary that was on cable.  Uh-huh. 
[02:42:00]  You know mermaids are like real?  Whoa.  Wow.  That's true.  I heard about that documentary.  Haven't seen it yet.  Sal says it's good.  He gave me a tape.  I'm sure he can make you copy.  All right.  I'm on.  I'm on that motherfucker.  Yeah.  Wow.  I'm still thinking he might have spun that quickly.  I think he was trying to spin, spin, spin.  So.  Yeah, but if he was spinning, it was like getting stuck in the mud and just that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right.  Slam on the accelerator.  Because either story doesn't work.  No.  It's like he, he, if he made up a story, he made up one that didn't work either.  Like you don't come in here and try to trick you. 
[02:42:30]  You tell you guys what the punchline is, and then you guys with him try to trick someone  else.  I don't know what the goal was with that one, but.  There was going to be a big gotcha.  Gotcha.  By the way, look at this video.  Fake.  Gotcha, guys.  He was acting.  Yeah.  I liked his acting.  Raise your hand if you're not an asshole.  Guess just me.  Did you hear the Dickie Goodman E-Rock song? 
[02:43:00]  I have not heard it yet.  Well, here it is.  Breaking news.  This is SLOBO Channel 5 Breaking News.  Good evening.  Tonight we bring you a Channel 5 Breaking News exclusive.  Hey, this is Chad the Weatherman, and we're coming live from the interstate where Slabo's  fat ass is blocking traffic.  Mr. Nagle, just where were you going in such a hurry? 
[02:43:30]  I take you to the candy shop.  I see.  And what was your reason for going there?  I want candy.  What?  I want candy.  Uh-huh.  That makes sense.  What were you going to buy there?  She make me like a lollipop.  And what do you eat your candy with?  I'll eat my candy.  Should we go with the critique?  Yeah.  I want candy you do once, not twice. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  And you just say lollipop, not treat me like a lollipop.  Right.  He's leaving in the syllables before.  Uh-huh.  Right.  So it's like, what were you trying to buy?  She licked me like a lollipop.  Yeah, no, you just say lollipop.  Yeah.  And everyone knows what song you use.  And he's staying with the one topic much too long.  Plus he goes, where were you going to?  Yeah.  And then the answer is, I'll take you to the candy shop.  Right.  And you don't need to play the I want candy twice.  That's what I said.  No.  Yeah, I said that one.  Look, the guy tweeted us a hundred times, and now he gets the big over-the-top critique. 
[02:44:30]  I told him.  Dude, he tweeted me like five times in the span of eight hours.  Yeah.  I got a bunch too.  Trust me.  When you guys send in really good stuff, we see it.  We see it.  Well, let's continue.  All right.  All right.  Mr. Nagel, it's no secret you're an exceptionally large man, and our viewers want to know, just  what did you eat that caused you to balloon to such an enormous size? 
[02:45:00]  Cheeseburger in paradise.  Oh, true.  He just put cheeseburger.  And you'd say like, just eating a cheeseburger doesn't make you that big.  What if he said like-  A lot of cheeseburgers.  Like you should say like a garbage truck or something like that.  Right, right, right.  And then he plays like so much of the song. 
[02:45:30]  No.  Why would Dickie Goodman do it?  He just said, I'm just a cheeseburger in paradise.  I guess Dickie Goodman did have a talent.  Yes, that this guy does not seem to possess.  Okay.  Surely that can't be all.  What else did you eat?  No.  You just used Southern Fried Chicken finger licking. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, sure.  Boom.  Like-  We're using this guy to get better ones.  Sorry, buddy.  There can even be a couple where it's okay if-  What is that song?  Oh, I think I know that one somewhere.  The answer still has to make sense to the question.  Yes.  Of course.  That's the whole thing to it.  That's the whole thing.  If you wouldn't answer that question like that, why would you leave all that extra shit  in there?  What's all that red jelly around your mouth and chin? 
[02:46:30]  No, just my cherry pie.  There you got it.  You got a clean drop right there.  Sweet cherry pie.  That's it.  That's all you need.  That's all you need.  Not half the fucking chorus.  Although that one works a little better than the other ones, but still.  Still here.  You want to keep it moving.  Cool drink of water.  What does that have to do with cherry pie being around his mouth?  Nothing.  He just likes the song so much.  He wants to hear them.  Yeah. 
[02:47:00]  Uh-huh.  And what are those stains on your shirt?  Mom's spaghetti.  I see.  That's it.  E-Rock, a lot of people have accused you of sneaking into the studio at night and stealing  a certain item.  Do you care to say what exactly it was you stole?  Milk and cereal.  Milk and cereal.  Milk and cereal.  Cereal and milk.  Well, here come the police.  I can see them now.  Oh, and yes, it looks like they're placing E-Rock under arrest.  Slobo, is there anything you'd like to say?  What is the charge?  Eating a meal?  A succulent Chinese meal? 
[02:47:30]  Well, that's all we have time for.  I gotta get back to the station by 8 o'clock, but my watch is broken.  E-Rock, do you know what time it is?  It's peanut butter jelly time.  Peanut butter jelly time.  Of course it is, E-Rock.  Back to you, Opie.  Well, you know, we'll get better ones now.  See? 
[02:48:00]  We'll use that as an example.  There's the bar.  Right.  There's where the bar is right there.  It's gotta be like this.  It's gotta move.  Right.  I mean, you know, they did a pretty good job, I guess, whatever.  But that's why sometimes you send one tweet.  Right.  Let people listen to it off the air.  And then if it doesn't make the air, maybe it's better.  Don't fucking beg to have your shit played.  Because there's usually a reason.  Now people know what not to do.  What's his name?  With their Dickie Goodman E-Rock songs. 
[02:48:30]  Tannerite Mike.  T-A-N-N-E-R-I-T-E Mike.  He's a good dude.  Whatever.  I mean, he tried.  He was a little excited and anxious.  Tannerite Mike.  It wasn't bad.  Wow.  It was bad.  Yeah.  I would say it was bad, too.  I'm trying to be honest.  I'm going to say it was bad.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it's the easiest topic in the world.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like guaranteed laughs.  And you can't make a Dickie Goodman song if you don't understand the Dickie Goodman formula. 
[02:49:00]  And how, you know, you put together the clips.  Oh, that was too long.  Okay.  Well, thank you.  Thank you to that guy.  And, you know, we'll get more, hopefully, in the coming days.  Thank you for your service.  Oh.  Yeah.  Did you just read my mind?  What happened?  I was about to say, I need to make a request.  Stop sending me the Ventura Stern for president shit.  Oh, God.  I know.  I've gotten that a thousand times.  That is so weird.  You just did the impression. 
[02:49:30]  I know.  That's literally the next thing I was going to say.  Anytime I hear thank you, I think, you know, thank you for your service.  You know, I mean, Stern's smart enough to know what the media will bite on, but it's just a goof.  Stop.  Oh.  I have no desire to talk about it at all.  It's a dumb, silly fucking thing they're doing.  I get so many fucking tweets about that.  What, they're actually running for the presidency?  Are they?  Are they really?  I didn't even fucking.  Really? 
[02:50:00]  They're going to do this?  I wouldn't even read a story like that.  Oh.  Because it's just.  They tweet us enough about it.  I know.  I just couldn't even deal.  Really?  That's happening?  On InfoWars?  And what is InfoWars saying about it?  It's Alex Jones' website.  All right.  What is he saying?  Is he at least saying it's a stupid goof and that they'll get a little press out of it?  No, this is former Governor Jesse Ventura and radio personality Howard Stern are set Wednesday.  on Stern's radio show to discuss the serious possibility of a 2016 presidential run. 
[02:50:30]  No, no.  To goof on it.  There's nothing serious about it.  Well, talking on and off air to Alex Jones, Ventura made it clear this is very serious and not a stunt.  Uh-huh.  And they're going to try to sign on a Secretary of State turd.  So Ventura's going to run for president and Howard's going to be his VP. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, because Howard loves being second cheese.  Thank you.  Howard's ego will not allow that.  We all know that.  This is a stupid goof.  It's such a stunt.  Please.  Can we wake up Alex Jones?  Can we cold call him now?  Oh, boy.  That seems fair.  I mean, Stern has indicated that he will probably quit his current show in 2015 anyway, leaving  the path clear for a presidential campaign to begin the same year.  Yeah, sure.  All right.  Like a real campaign. 
[02:51:30]  President Stern.  Okay, sure.  Of course.  Of course that's going to happen.  Wasn't he running for governor once?  He did.  He didn't follow through because he didn't want to release all of his financial information.  And wouldn't he make a better first lady at this point?  I was going to say pernt.  At this pernt.  At this pernt.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't.  I don't even care they're doing it.  I care more that some of these almost legitimate sites aren't saying, like, obviously this is a complete and utter goof. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, well, Alex Jones is Jesse Ventura.  No, but it's on other sites, too.  Yeah, yeah.  It's on other sites.  But because Alex Jones was, he broke it, right?  Didn't Alex Jones break the story?  Yes, he did.  We talk about the goof ticket all the time.  Every election, you get kind of a goof ticket.  It's fun.  And those people get a little press.  Because for whatever reason, everyone likes to play along.  Yeah.  But they're not serious about it. 
[02:52:30]  They like to make believe it's real.  No.  Stop it.  All right.  Good for them.  Jesse the body.  Like, Jesse would have any credibility to run for office anymore.  He, you know, he was the governor for a while.  The governor of fucking, what, Minnesota?  Yeah.  Which kind of amazes me.  Which is amazing.  I mean, we've had him on enough to realize how.  He comes off as certifiably insane.  To realize how amazing that actually was.  Right.  At the time.  Because, wow. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  Jesse the mind.  Yep.  Jesse the body is now Jesse the mind.  And he was the governor.  But then, like, he almost seemed sane when he was the governor.  He seemed crazy during the wrestling years.  But he had to be because he was a wrestler.  It's crazy.  He was able to keep it pushed down.  He toned it down.  Just enough.  Just enough.  He cut off his riffraff hairdo and went with the shaved head look.  And he was always well-kempt and putting a nice suit and everything. 
[02:53:30]  And then once he got out of that office, he just went completely batshit crazy to where,  you know, no one's going to.  You hear him debate on, like, some of the talk shows.  And he's just, he's a fucking madman.  Or was he always batshit crazy?  That's just it.  Maybe he was.  And they were able to cover that up when he was the governor.  Where he jumped the shark was, he said it on our show, I think, that his son or somebody  close to him showed him the Loose Change documentary.  Oh, God.  And that set him off down this path.  Loose Change.  Well, we got a guy now saying that Bin Laden's story is all bullshit. 
[02:54:00]  What, the killing of Bin Laden?  Yeah.  Which journalist is saying this?  An acclaimed journalist saying that the White House version of Bin Laden's death there  is one big lie.  I do.  If you look at the way the White House handled things like Benghazi and the Syria situation,  you realize that if the White House and Obama was involved in that, like they like to say  he was, it would have been a clusterfuck.  Because everything this guy does is a clusterfuck. 
[02:54:30]  I find it really strange we never saw a picture.  No.  No picture.  No fucking.  I find that strange.  And their reasoning for that very strange.  Meanwhile, when they showed the video of Saddam Hussein being basically tortured at the end  of his life.  Being hung and we got that.  We got Gaddafi getting a fucking...  Although that was from a cell phone, so it makes it harder, obviously.  I get it, but...  Gaddafi getting something shoved up his asshole in the back of a fucking pickup truck after  they got him.  And then the most wanted man on the face of the earth? 
[02:55:00]  Nothing?  I don't know.  I always found it a little strange.  It's a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, Seymour Hirsch.  Contends...  Seymour Butts?  Seymour Butts.  Hey, would you blow me?  Well, Heywood was there, but he didn't have a lot to do with this one.  Paddy O'Furniture?  Paddy O'Furniture was definitely involved with this one.  Alcoholic!  Contends the 2011 U.S. Navy SEALs raid that resulted in the killing of 9-11 Mastermind Osama Bin Laden  is one big lie. 
[02:55:30]  Wow.  And he won a Pulitzer.  Who was that, Sal?  Did Sal say this?  Oh, yeah, Sal.  He knew it was fake, I heard, and...  He knew.  He knew the whole time.  Yeah, he wanted to play a gag on everyone.  He was just waiting for us to realize.  Fucking Sal.  Not one word of it is true.  Hirsch told the Guardian newspaper in an interview meant to drum up publicity for his new book  about national security.  Nothing's been done about that story.  It's one big lie.  The 76-year-old Hirsch told the Guardian.  Dixie Normans. 
[02:56:00]  Dixie Normans.  I like that one.  Okay.  He's basically saying that the account hasn't been appropriately looked at by journalists  or looked into.  Oh.  The Pakistanis put out a report.  Don't get me going on it.  Let's put it this way.  It was done with considerable American input.  It's bullshit.  Wow.  So what's the...  It's a bullshit report.  What's the bullshit?  That it never happened or it happened differently than...  It doesn't really explain that part.  That's what's frustrating about this story. 
[02:56:30]  Than the White House says.  The book will also discuss Hirsch's view that the U.S. media hasn't committed enough resources  to investigate journalism.  Horses.  It's pathetic.  They are more than obscure, Hirsch said of the American media.  They are afraid to pick on this guy, Obama.  Well, yeah.  It's obvious.  It used to be when you were in a situation when something very dramatic happened, the  president and the minions around the president had control of the narrative.  He would pretty much know they would do the best they could to tell the story straight,  he said.  Now that doesn't happen anymore. 
[02:57:00]  Now they take advantage of something like that and they work out how to reelect the president.  Mm-hmm.  So I always found that one strange.  I think you have to show the picture, man.  Yeah, because we really don't have any, like, eyewitness kind of proof.  Right.  I mean, it pissed off people no matter what.  So what would showing the picture do?  Right.  Really get everyone outraged?  They're pretty outraged that we took them out.  Dump them in the ocean. 
[02:57:30]  Don't see them no more.  Won't see them no more.  Yeah.  Government's shutting down, huh?  Well, the clock is ticking.  CNN has a fucking disaster clock going.  Right.  They put time to a countdown to a disaster.  I don't know.  That countdown clock?  Yeah.  Oh, I thought it was when that big bitch was going to go on a diet. 
[02:58:00]  That bitch is big.  That bitch is big.  Is she a big bitch?  Oh.  Oh, no.  Well, breaking news is this?  Is this breaking?  Sal just sent it to me and said, this one actually is real.  Oh, Sal.  Jesus.  Dominic Barber arrested.  Fuck this guy.  In choke try?  Dominic Barber was the lawyer that represented Ant's ex.  Yes.  A complete and utter twat.  Oh, he's a fucking disaster now.  And his life is just getting worse and worse by the month. 
[02:58:30]  He's been arrested.  This time he is accused of choking a woman.  I'll choke a bitch.  Wow, look at him.  He doesn't even look like the same fucking guy anymore.  No, look how angry he looks now.  He looks angry and crazy.  He was trying to come off like, it's okay, like in every interview, but it finally caught  up with him, I guess.  And then he loved calling our show to talk about no hard feelings with Anthony.  Hey, Anthony.  I tell him to go fuck himself.  I remember that day.  What a twat.  What are the circumstances?  Yeah, what's the latest on this? 
[02:59:00]  It was made at 11 p.m. after a woman.  Last night?  Yeah.  Okay.  Called the police, and she said that they'd gotten into a verbal argument, and then  Barbara put his-  I'm Heisenberg.  I'm crazy.  I watched the Breaking Bad, and I fucking just figured I'd choke a bitch.  Tread lightly.  Tread lightly.  The woman was at his home.  That's important, I guess.  Yeah, and so they were in a verbal argument in his home, and then he put his hands around 
[02:59:30]  her throat and applied pressure, quote unquote.  Nice.  He soon released his grip, police said, and the woman was able to flee.  He's already facing other charges.  Oh, yeah.  Stemming from what?  Well, he shoplifted-  Run-ins with the law, you're just saying.  Okay.  He shoplifted a YSL pocketbook, Yves Saint Laurent.  Yeah.  From a high-end boutique.  Oh, yeah.  He's down to shoplifting.  Shoplifting.  Holy fuck.  And choking a bitch. 
[03:00:00]  Plus, he harassed, stalked, and tried to extort $200,000 from one of his ex-wives.  And now he choked a bitch, allegedly.  Allegedly.  According to this article.  That's breaking news, huh?  I can't believe how much money I had to give that fucking guy.  And he went through it all.  Oh, yeah.  He went through all your money nice.  Oh, yeah.  Mine and a bunch of other people's.  Wow.  And apparently, he got in trouble for kind of misappropriation of funds when people would  give him a retainer, and he wouldn't do a lot of the work, and he wouldn't pay the 
[03:00:30]  retainer back.  Man.  So, he got in trouble for that.  He is in Dutch.  Man, when he used to come fucking strolling into that courtroom, smiling.  Anthony, hi.  Come on.  Do the imitation.  Go ahead.  Do it.  He loves the publicity.  He'll do the imitation.  He loved being in the spotlight.  Now, where's a cop to put me in cuffs, you dumb fuck? 
[03:01:00]  Good.  Good for you.  What happened to the fucking, wasn't he born again or something?  Last we were reading, he was born again, and he found Jesus.  Jesus said,  And Jesus said unto thee,  Choke a bitch.  I saw another footprint, sets of footprints next to me during the times of my life.  And the most difficult ones, there was only one set of footprints.  Jesus, why did you leave me? 
[03:01:30]  He said,  I did not leave you.  I went off to choke a bitch.  He was just carrying the bitch by her neck.  Yeah.  At that point in his life.  Life.  Allegedly.  Her feet were swinging in the breeze.  Right.  Allegedly.  Oh, God.  It couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  There's this whole karmic thing, you know?  Karma, whatnot.  And it works both ways.  You really don't wish bad things on people. 
[03:02:00]  But when they do happen, you have to look and say,  It could not have happened to a more worthy asshole than the likes of a Dominic Barbara.  Take it easy, funny man.  Did they release him?  Is he in jail?  Did he make bail?  I should bail him out.  Go down there.  How great would that be?  Hey, Dominic, come on.  Hop in.  Hop in.  We're going to go for a ride. 
[03:02:30]  Just me and you.  You fuck.  All right.  We'll figure out if he's in jail or not.  He faces arraignment today.  Oh, then he was probably still in the slam overnight.  And he don't have any cash, so.  Where is this going down?  We should go to the.  Hempstead.  Let's go say hi.  Hempstead.  It's close.  I should sit in.  Oh, sit in on his arraignment.  That like he fucking called the press to sit in on my fucking divorce case.  That fuck.  I get to sit there. 
[03:03:00]  He pulled out all the tricks.  How you doing?  You still want me to do the voice?  Hey, let me do the voice.  He called in the press.  They were sitting in the front row for Ant's case.  That's nice.  That was fun.  That's a good tactic to take.  Yeah.  Thank you.  All right.  We'll wrap up the show next with a couple other doozies.  We've got a couple more doozies.  Do we have a Lulu?  Maybe a Lulu.  Definitely a doozy.  All right.  Do we have a Whopper?  Sale will tell us a Whopper.  Because it's a lie.  Get it? 
[03:03:30]  The Open Entity Show continues in moments.  And now these messages.  The Open Entity Show continues.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  Oh, yeah.  Wham.  Wham.  Wham.  Wham.  Wham.  Wham.  Wham.  Got a very special guest on our phone line.  Oh.  The great Colin Quinn.  Colin.  I like when Opie says we have a very special guest.  It always makes me laugh.  Yes. 
[03:04:00]  Colin.  First, I was driving up to a gig last week.  And there, I'm listening to the radio.  The show's on.  First, it says, which thank God my Twitter follows.  I don't even notice.  Twitter people notice and point it out to me.  So I get curious.  It says Bobo and Colin Quinn.  I have second bill of the Bobo.  Now, that's bad enough.  Then, my name is misspelled.  Oh, no.  That happens a lot.  How do they spell it? 
[03:04:30]  Two L's.  Who's in charge of that, Sam?  That's either E-Rock or Sal.  No, I'm not in charge of it.  Sam, you're in charge of that, are you?  No.  Colin's saying you are.  Look, I host the show.  I don't do all the technical stuff.  There is a lot of misspelling.  In all honesty, though, E-Rock, of course.  You just look at E-Rock and you know he can't spell.  Yes.  He just has that look of like a dumb speller.  You know what I mean?  They're constantly screwing up the spelling on that. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It kind of ruined my fall a lot.  I remember my fun fall ride with Norton years ago.  It's the same route, you know, and how he made that into a nightmare for the stupid cynicism, you know?  And he has to stop at every service area.  Oh, I told you, that's a crowding point of my whole life.  Because Norton screwed me a week before on a gig by not stopping at a rest area when I wanted to get to McDonald's or Wendy's. 
[03:05:30]  So I passed right by, I pulled into the service area, like we're going to Starbucks, you know, you have to have a stove, and then pulled right out onto the main road.  Good for you.  By the way, on my trip, I was listening to the Michael Shannon interview.  Yes.  He sounds like Stephen Wright.  You guys, yeah.  I give you guys credit.  You guys are the most forced, worst interviewers I've ever heard. 
[03:06:00]  That was the worst interviewer I've ever heard.  Because you're in the middle of doing what you love, busting bobos, busting people's balls, harassing people.  And then a guest comes on, and you're sitting there with your hands folded like phony little Catholic school kids, and trying to be nice and civil for 15 minutes, and hope they can get out to you if that's what you love doing.  You know what?  I'm so glad you bring this up.  He's right.  No, you're absolutely right.  We changed gears with some of these people, like they're royalty, and it's like, fuck. 
[03:06:30]  Well, it happened to you with the Mark Cuban.  Colin Quinn looks at me like, what are you guys doing?  This isn't your show?  Yeah, and the whole audience is just waiting.  We're all sitting there waiting.  Okay, I'll be gone soon.  Whoever the guest is, Mr. Serious Guy.  You know what I mean?  He's right.  Yeah, I don't.  The most infuriating part might be Norton, who pipes in with his little questions like he's a serious entity. 
[03:07:00]  He really thinks he's Charlie Rose.  Oh, man, I hate what Colin's right, but he's right.  I know.  There are so many times.  We've thought about this for years.  I don't really like having a lot of guests on this radio show.  I get it to him with Paul Anka, too.  What do you mean?  You left him on hold.  Well, you know, it's Paul Anka.  Then we, like, you know what?  We have Paul Anka in that day, and we panic because you're calling in.  We're like, oh, my God, we can't possibly put these two together, even though that would have been good. 
[03:07:30]  Right.  Oh, my God.  No, you were right.  Your instinct was right.  It would have been horrible.  No, horrible in a good way.  Every show.  Yeah, the Paul Anka.  I can't believe you guys are throwing that back in my face.  Sorry.  I think that's my fault.  I panicked.  I'm like, oh, my God, we've got to make sure we do a proper Paul Anka interview.  Yeah, that's what happens.  You know, we feel like we have to do a real interview.  You guys decide to become professional for 15 minutes every show, and it's uncomfortable.  I personally hate it because, you know, our history, we used to beat the shit out of guests 
[03:08:00]  to the point no guest would come on our show anymore.  That's true.  It was kind of like the Morton Downey Jr. thing, you know?  People weren't on to Morton Downey Jr. at first, and then when they were on to him,  he had to take all the shitty guests because no one in their right mind would go on that  show anymore, knowing everybody was against the person.  Right.  So then we had to, like, start being nice to guests, and now I think we're overly nice.  But even they noticed there's an uncomfortable air. 
[03:08:30]  They're going, what's going on here?  They see in the corner there's, like, some splattered chocolate.  There's, like, a half-naked hooker looming in the background, and you guys are like, so?  It's like going into a house where there's, like, a murder victim just happened.  We can sit down and have a nice chat.  We're going to have a chat before we get back to the debauchery.  Yeah, there's a weird inability to transition really comfortably between those things.  I don't know what to do with guests instead. 
[03:09:00]  You know, you just fucking interview them.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Maybe you guys could do something like, you know, say, hey, we have some wacky times in  here, and just say, wait a little crazy thing.  It's not what you actors do, but you don't have any crazy times like that.  Yeah, that would be good.  I mean, you're right.  Other than the Barbara Walters of comedians going, so, you play a scary guy on the show.  I've also, shut up. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, we are tools when it comes to the, I don't know what to do, but what do you do?  But more importantly, are you guys in production, you know, riding around with Bobo?  Is this in production yet?  Yeah, the show.  Yeah.  He wants to have a surprise Thanksgiving.  We're going to burst.  We're going to burst in on him on Thanksgiving.  Right.  That's what he wanted.  Colin Quinn to burst in on him for Thanksgiving.  What?  And then people suggested we make that Anthony's house and that Anthony's house.  And I could shoot him, yeah. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, I blocked.  Home invasion.  That's what I missed on Twitter, because I blocked him again.  You block him.  I know.  That's what I missed, because that's kind of fun.  Dude.  He wants you to blow off your family or wherever you go for Thanksgiving.  Yeah.  To show.  Oh, my God.  To bust into his house.  So, of course, I retweeted and went, wow, Carl, this seems like a good idea.  It does.  Just to get Bobo going, of course.  But it's true.  But he loved Anthony the most, obviously. 
[03:10:30]  The lack of logic in these people.  It's amazing.  Bobo has his issues.  What are you going to do?  Yeah, but we've got a bunch of people like that.  I don't know what they listen to.  Plus, if I burst in, it's his idea to burst in.  It's not really that much of a surprise burst, you know?  No, no.  It's his idea, so it wouldn't surprise.  He'd be like, oh, it's Colin Burstigid.  Right.  Yeah.  Although his mother and sister probably would get a little shaken up. 
[03:11:00]  No.  The mom's a big Colin Quinn fan.  She'd be out of her mind happy.  Well, then she would be happy.  And then you've got Bobo on the barbecue, barbecuing up some stuff for the Thanksgiving meal.  It's beautiful.  Having two beers and getting hammered.  Huh?  It's beautiful.  He'd start throwing up on people's floors because he's had two beers.  Right.  You're sitting there awkwardly as the dog's barking.  You know how happy I am that Anthony didn't even get mad when Bobo's trouble. 
[03:11:30]  It was so perfect.  How could I possibly get mad?  It was, you know, and it was on like a linoleum fake wood floor.  Easy cleanup.  So I really didn't care.  Him yelling, I told you I wanted to pace myself was hilarious.  He was drunk 10 minutes into the party.  10 minutes in.  He almost drowned.  There's a video of him almost drowning in Anthony's pool. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, when he jumped into my pool holding a hamburger.  That was way earlier.  He was holding a hamburger and jumped in my pool.  Fucking Bobo.  Never a dull moment.  That motherfucker.  I was going to say.  That's hilarious, guys.  Excuse me.  Now we have to break.  Hugh Jackman's coming back.  You didn't like our Hugh Jackman piece?  You didn't like our...  I didn't see the Hugh Jackman.  That's a big A-lister.  Oh, it was a big one.  The name of somebody that I thought would be, you know. 
[03:12:30]  We got a couple pop culture things that came together that day.  You got the big Hugh Jackman, and then he's trying out a Cronut on our show.  It was amazing.  It was like the Today Show.  Yeah.  It was pretty good.  We could do that Today Show stuff.  Oh, it was fantastic.  It was terrific.  We asked him, you know, acting or singing, what was your first love?  Sure.  Sure.  I've been saying this for a while, man.  Yeah.  I have been saying this for a while.  I'm like, what's wrong with us? 
[03:13:00]  None of these people want to be friends with us, so what are we doing?  Yeah, what are we doing?  It's hilarious.  You guys are like Kathy Leonoda.  How embarrassing.  That drivel.  Oh, man.  Why is that on TV?  Yeah.  I watched that shit at the gym just to be annoyed.  I know me, too.  You do, right?  It's so stupid.  It's the dumbest thing on TV.  But it's the best because they're like, woo-hoo, yo, have another drink. 
[03:13:30]  YOLO.  Everybody love it, too.  And even on other morning shows, I was like, hey, watch out.  You're going to be like Kathy Leonoda with that drink, and everyone's cackling.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, they think they're edgy because they've got a glass of wine on TV.  Look out.  That they barely touch, by the way.  Because I bet you someone gave Kathy Lee a talking to.  Yeah, you think she was lushing it up too much?  I would imagine.  Look out.  Wild women. 
[03:14:00]  She's still trying to get over that whole...  What, gift getting fucking the prostitute in the hotel room and trying to fuck her in  the ass on film?  Yeah, that was like the first setup of those things.  Yeah, that was like the first celebrity, like, I'm going to fucking set you up with it.  I'm going to fuck you over.  Yeah.  Oh, that was a good one.  She's on fucking Regis with her dumb kid and talking about this great life.  And then there's GIF on the cover of the National Enquirer or the star wanting to fuck a hooker 
[03:14:30]  in the asshole.  I don't know why that happened.  Don't you wonder why that was the first one?  Like, who got pissed off at who?  Right.  You know?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, they obviously could have done that to a thousand people in the past 20 years.  Yep.  Yeah, really.  You know, it just happened to the GIF.  Did he hear from Squartz?  Did he find his fax machine?  I did not hear from him.  I thought after we talked about this on Friday that we would get the answer.  Need a fax machine. 
[03:15:00]  Anywhere in the Manchester area, I'd get a fax machine.  If I need it fast, I got to get some important stuff out.  There's a show there, man.  We got to get all these people together and just film them.  Like, don't you need a fax machine to be where you're faxing to?  Like, if you have one fax machine in the whole world and Squartz has it?  They kind of work together, don't they?  Yeah, yeah.  Because then you should expect the fax back from that person with the answer.  Yeah.  I think that's kind of a question-answer thing, the fax machine. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, shit.  I got an important fax, but it was on that rolly paper,  and it rolled up and rolled under the counter.  Oh, my God.  Match figure.  Hey, you want to – should we bring back the retarded Laverne Shirley?  Are we ready yet, Kyle?  Yeah.  It was fun last time we were in.  I think we're ready again.  Although Marion is very mad at us because we recorded her saying the N-word.  I remember when she was doing the twerking.  She was twerking in the elevator with Who Kid. 
[03:16:00]  But the husband called.  And she's like, yeah, that's right, my niggas.  She was all kinds of fucked up.  She said it – wasn't the black dude encouraging her to say it?  Yeah, of course.  He gave her a pass.  DJ Who Kid.  Marion's got a ghetto pass.  Yeah.  Yeah, she got the ghetto pass.  She has street cred.  But then the husband called us.  He was mad.  And they were like, well, let's talk to Marion.  But she went to work, but it was obvious she was still there.  Well, I think it's also, you know, the times we live in, he's more outraged about that than 
[03:16:30]  the fact that we were talking about certain, you know, hygienic problems that were happening  that day, too.  Oh, God, that's right.  Fucking lady died.  Well, we're looking at the video right now.  She's trying to throw up gang signs, and she looks like one of those people afflicted  with lobster claw hands.  Yeah.  She's so fucking –  And she's got her –  Disgusting.  She's got her monkey's concert T-shirt on.  Yeah, yeah.  The Davy Jones Memorial.  It's the Davy Jones Memorial concert T-shirt, because the band went on without Davy. 
[03:17:00]  Of course.  It was a –  It was a discharge.  What a dick move to do.  Well, yeah, I had a discharge.  Yeah, yeah.  But I'll tell you the truth.  It's also a dick move.  The first time I came out, I came on with them, they were hardcore parrot heads.  Right.  Uh-huh.  I'll tell you, obviously, they've switched to the monkeys.  Yes, yes.  They're all about the monkeys.  And she's –  This puppet needs all the love he can get, you know?  And she's proud that she knows a lot of his songs.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, yeah, Davy Jones, I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  I think I got my friend.  Oh, that was so disgusting.  She got her last period on our show, right?  No, I think she fucking had an orgasm.  I think Colin was right.  That turned out just to be a discharge.  Well, she came on our show.  Yeah, I think she was so excited.  I thought she was having a –  It's been so many years, you know?  Yeah, she was squirming and, you know, the pants are rubbing.  Oh, my God.  Before you know it, I feel a little – 
[03:18:00]  Bring back Hugh Jackman.  I'm sure there's a pastry we can talk about.  Oh.  So, Hugh, during Les Mis, when you were filming Les Mis, now, I'm fascinated that you all sang your own lines in that.  What was that like?  I kind of hate Colin's honesty.  Oh, I know.  I mean, you keep your honesty to yourself.  It hurts too much.  How do you go between a movie like Prestige and a movie like Wolverine seamlessly? 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  Literally during – and I'm sure I'm speaking for a lot of listeners – during the Michael Shannon interview, I wanted to drive right off – right into another –  I mean, it was a good interview, but –  He wasn't a bundle of energy.  No, it was a horrible –  Oh, okay.  I had a different angle on it.  I'm like, no, it was a good interview, but it just doesn't belong on the show.  No.  But you're saying it's just a bad interview, and it still doesn't belong on the show.  It's not possible if it was like a first date.  You guys would have said, yeah, that didn't work out. 
[03:19:00]  We just didn't click.  We say yes to a lot of guests because Jimmy wants to get those pictures taken.  I feel like we're being held hostage.  Yeah, and the worst part is Jim thinks because he watches Boardwalk Empire, he's going to have the insightful questions.  But instead, the night before he does it, set at the cellar, he runs home, falls asleep too quickly, and wakes up.  He comes up with an awful question.  So in his mind, he really preps because he watches the show. 
[03:19:30]  Right, right.  But he doesn't do the prep of thinking like, hey, what would be an interesting angle question?  He has a question that he thinks in his mind is interesting, but it's not.  Unprepared horse shit.  Unprepared.  I'm scared that Colin's consulting our show right now.  Unprepared horse shit.  Bullshit.  He swells his shit.  You can just see him on the show. 
[03:20:00]  On episode two, there was a...  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I see him on the show.  The guy just looks him like, shut up, fanboy.  I don't care.  He really does.  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  Unprepared by watching the shows.  I'll give him that.  All right.  Yes.  He doesn't sit down and go, what would be the angle on this?  You know?  No.  Was Providence good to you there, Colin?  What's that now?  Was Providence good to you?  Oh, it was fantastic. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  It was great, guys.  It was great, guys.  Liked it?  Yeah.  It was great.  Where's the next stop on the big tour?  Oh, next stop, which we went to Ridgefield, Connecticut.  Okay.  Then we're going to the soap pack, Jersey, of course, and then the Virginia, North Carolina.  I'm hitting all the 13th Colony store guys.  Yes.  You got to hit them all.  You got to hit them all, right?  Yes.  Yes.  And I told you the big joke about Rhode Island was how they weren't even at the convention, 
[03:21:00]  so we had a good laugh over that one.  We're 13.  We're about 14 hours away from shutdown.  Yeah.  From the government shutdown.  Oh, that's right.  It's perfect for my show.  Yeah, yeah.  It kind of is.  It's a good tie-in.  Oh, man.  I don't know what's going to happen in 14 hours.  What happens?  They have a countdown clock.  Like, when it reaches zero, something's going to happen, right?  You can't get your passport. 
[03:21:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  What else?  Just a couple of things.  Oh, so you're not going to be able to do, like, some government-related things.  Some of them, right.  Some.  But, I mean, you know, the Air Force is still going to be flying.  And if you've got the government job, you don't get paid.  What about the post office?  Delivering mail?  I think they...  Yeah, go to the mail.  All right.  So what the fuck is the big deal?  Oh, gee.  I don't get it.  How about we just have a shutdown?  That means everything's shut down. 
[03:22:00]  But if there's a clock...  They have special rules.  When you have a countdown clock, I'm seeing it on Fox, on CNN.  They're all counting down.  There's a clock on the screen constantly.  Wouldn't you think that when it reaches zero, something happens that is this big thing?  Devastating.  Well, like, you know, like, I mean, a lot of people don't go to work as far as in, you know, like, about, I think, like, 500,000 people don't work.  All right.  Okay.  And who's going to do the fun part of the countdown?  You know, the 10-9-8 thing. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, yeah.  Will they have some special person doing that?  It can't be Dick Clark.  Yeah, unfortunately not.  Dick Clark.  Scorch.  I'm starting to think that CNN is pushing some fear forward here with the countdown clock.  That's what I'm thinking.  It's a little fear right there.  Shutdown countdown.  13 hours, 55 minutes to the shutdown.  I don't know.  Oh, that's what it is?  It's a countdown?  Yeah, there's an actual countdown.  It's smart.  That's what it keeps people watching.  Are you kidding me?  We'll be talking with Harry Reid in the upcoming... 
[03:23:00]  Wouldn't that be great?  We'll do an interview.  So, the shutdown, sir.  Now, all I'm thinking about is our interviews.  Well, you know what?  If you guys had political people on, it would actually work fine.  Well, we had Rumsfeld on.  Ant was going for the real interview.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Because he's a big fan of the Rumsfeld.  And Louis C.K.  And Louis C.K. was asking him if he's a lizard or not.  Right, right, right.  That was a classic moment on the show.  Yeah, the politicians.  So, you're saying more of that type of thing.  More politicians.  He's a politician's on, yeah.  Yeah, okay.  But it's the fluff actor bullshit that Colin does not think works well on this program. 
[03:23:30]  I think Opie got to the root problem.  Norton wants autographs.  We feel guilty.  We're like, oh, if we say no, he's not going to get the big picture.  Yeah, Norton wants a picture.  That's all it is.  I am so scared the next time we got to interview anyone now.  Oh, no.  You're going to be in the back of my head.  You're going to be in the back of my head.  Oh, no.  I know.  You're going to be out there somewhere, which is creepy, counting on us to just blow it up. 
[03:24:00]  No, not even blow it up.  Just, I mean, the stilted dialogue.  Oh, he's right.  What happened?  I hear him.  And everybody politely waits.  Each one of you politely waits for the next guy before you ask your next question.  Yes.  And then if you step on somebody, you're like, oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  What?  You were saying?  Ask your bit of importantness here. 
[03:24:30]  Shit, he's right.  Fuck you, Colin.  I'm getting out of here.  Yeah, I guess.  I'll see you later.  All right, Carl.  Thanks.  Thanks for nothing.  I am Colin Quinn on Twitter.  Go there now.  He's brilliant.  Fucking gang.  We didn't get to the bunny story.  Is it good?  Is there a video?  Yes.  Oh, I got to see the video.  What happens?  It's good.  Yeah?  Yeah, I don't want to give it away.  Something happened?  I didn't realize there was an actual video. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah, this is a little bunny that this family found about a week before.  Okay.  And so they were taking care of it.  Nursed it back to health, and now you've got to do the right thing, and you've got to  put the bunny back in the wild, Anthony.  Yes.  A little baby bunny.  You know, that's the thing to do.  Yeah.  All right?  Don't walk in the bevels.  We've got to let Kermit go so he can find his mommy.  Mommy.  You want to put him out in the grass?  This is the little baby we've been feeding for a week.  For a week?  Mm-hmm. 
[03:25:30]  So now she's going to let the bunny go.  You hear the birds chirping.  That's the mommy.  Go with her.  And that's the mommy?  But it's your front lawn.  It's there?  And now they let the bunny go on the grass.  I'm going to mommy.  Going to mommy.  This is such a wonderful moment.  Just a wonderful, wonderful moment.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Fucking hawk took it. 
[03:26:00]  Holy shit.  Real?  Real?  Fake?  Almost 11 million views.  Real?  Fake?  I looked at it a bunch of times.  It looks real.  I know, but the one video where they took the kid away.  It was fake, yeah.  No, I know.  Why wouldn't that lady react crazy at that point?  Damn.  You see the bunny goes off into the distance and then a hawk swoops in and grabs the bunny. 
[03:26:30]  They've only got two videos.  The baby bunny.  It's not like they have a bunch of videos.  Well, I just get suspicious when the camera ends so quickly.  I get so, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because wouldn't there be a whole scene going on after that?  Right.  People going, what the fuck was that?  Oh, my God.  I get it to, right.  Some kind of reaction?  Huh?  He sold a child off camera.  Yeah.  I mean, it could legitimately be a hawk, but there could have been something done where, 
[03:27:00]  you know, the rabbit was replaced or something else.  Gotcha, gotcha.  I know.  We should get Sal to it.  Door to the end of that again.  Yeah.  Like, why would they stop rolling the camera?  Why?  All right, there it goes.  He's running.  They obviously are kind of attached to the thing.  They...  Where's your mommy?  The guy laughs, but then doesn't say anything. 
[03:27:30]  And you get one.  I think it's real.  Yeah, me too.  Because you don't want to panic and freak out the kid.  So she audibly gasps really, really loudly.  Yeah.  But, like, being in, like, that kind of situation.  There are a lot of parents that don't want to make their kid look stupid for YouTube hits.  And it's not a sensational fake kind of thing.  It could happen.  I mean...  Wow, that's pretty fucked up, then. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah, it is.  Remember, Colin's listening somewhere right now.  Hope he handled this properly.  Oh.  What?  Colin.  And this is just a prequel video of just a girl playing with the bunny.  Hmm.  Let's put the video up on our Facebook page.  Opie and Anthony.  What do you guys think?  Why let it go on the grass like that?  Huh?  That's right.  I mean...  Why are they letting it go? 
[03:28:30]  There's a yard.  And there's a road right in front.  Yeah.  And why would you only have the bunny for a week?  They found it.  Yeah, feed it for longer.  Wouldn't you feed it for longer?  No, I want to tell them.  And then why are they saying, oh, there's its mom over there?  Do you see the mom bunny?  No, but it was probably down further.  I mean, there are bunnies all over the place in the suburbs.  Why were they feeding it?  And why would they say there's mommy bunny over there?  And we don't see mommy bunny in the shot.  Because bunnies are small.  And then the bunny's running toward the supposed mommy bunny, but then the hawk gets it. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, I mean, you can barely see the little baby bunny anymore after it gets a certain length.  Well, that's where they do the old switcheroo.  The old switcheroo!  The old switcheroo!  Still, I don't know.  Yeah.  Switcheroo.  It's not the old switcheroo.  All right, y'all.  That was fun.  Yeah!  Back to bed for me. 
[03:29:30]  Fuck out of here.  I've got to deal with this seasonal algae shit.  All right, that's right.  Does Singulair work for this or not?  And what else can I take if I'm on the Singulair?  Could use the help today.  Singulair.  Bed rest and laughter.  Bed rest.  Best medicine.  Yeah.  Bed rest, that's stupid.  Bed rest.  What is that?  Laughter, plenty of fruits and veggies.  Yeah, I could do that.  Yeah.  Lucky charms?  Lucky charms.  Anything with colors.  Laughter is the best medicine, but don't tell the guy that was like, didn't take penicillin 
[03:30:00]  for his infection.  He just laughed.  He's just chuckling at it.  And then he died because it's really not the best medicine.  It's one of the worst.  Sometimes an antibiotic is, you know, things like that.  You hear Colin Quinn?  Colin, he says we do shitty interviews.  I thought you were going to have a heart attack in the back office hearing that.  No, I thought you did fantastic interviews.  I know Colin just LOLing.  Colin's pushing for much fewer guests.  Colin just LOLing.  That's just Colin. 
[03:30:30]  It's funny.  Oh, that Colin.  We do change the whole gist of the show to do an interview.  Yeah.  They're great interviews.  Yeah, we're like assholes just fucking off.  And then all of a sudden we, what?  We become fucking interviewers?  We become very polite.  You guys become professional broadcasters.  We become very, very polite.  I like that.  All right.  I say bravo.  I say bravo.  All right, I'm getting out of here.  Yep.  Don't let the South fool you.  Have a nice day.  What?  Don't let the South fool you. 
[03:31:00]  Is that what that was?  I know what he said.  Don't let the South fool you?  Don't let the South fool you.  Don't let the South fool you.  Don't let the South fool you.  Got it.  Fuck.  The Opie and Anthony show is pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  This show will be available later today with Sirius XM On Demand.  On Demand.  On Demand. 
[03:31:30]  After 1A Live is next.  This is After Opie and Anthony Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Boy, oh boy.  Only 13 hours and 38 minutes.  Before we no longer have a government in the United States of America.  I'm pretty sure government or no government, the show will continue as usual.  I can't confirm that, but Sirius XM not being a government agency I don't think will be affected. 
[03:32:00]  This is After Opie and Anthony Live.  Join us, won't you?  866-WOW1-WOW is the phone number.  866-969-1969.  And this government shutdown couldn't be coming at a worse time.  Everybody's all revved up from playing GTA V.  I know that's how I'm feeling.  Like, everybody's just looking for an excuse to act like a vigilante.  And now there's going to be news that there's no government, although that would be hilarious if people didn't really comprehend the full, you know, government shutdown thing, which basically just means, like Colin Quinn said on the phone a little earlier, that, you know, you won't be able to get passports. 
[03:32:30]  If it snows, it might not get plowed right away.  Luckily, it's still September, so it probably won't snow.  Although, technically, it'll be October by the time the government shuts down.  And we did have that snow at Halloween, but odds are we won't need the plows.  Other than that, I mean, public schools will still be functioning. 
[03:33:00]  I'm pretty sure you can still send mail.  But I don't know why passports wouldn't work.  You get your passports, you go to the post office for your passports.  So what, they're just going to close off that little closet that they turn into the passport office?  Doesn't seem rational at all.  But I would, it would be great.  And you know what'll happen if they close down, if they do this government shutdown, and there are people that are only going to half listen, or they're just going to have no idea what they're talking about or what they're hearing, and just go out and start committing crimes.  And then, much to their chagrin, the cops will be there. 
[03:33:30]  What do you mean?  I took the government shutdown.  What are you guys doing here?  Well, I can't wait to see it.  Sal, how are you doing?  Doing great, Sal.  You tell me.  Yep.  When did you know everything had gone south today for you?  Actually, before I went in.  So, the video you suggested, it was a video where a guy makes a slingshot.  Right.  And then he shoots himself in the face.  Yes.  But it was fake. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah.  And there's a video that follows it that is him explaining how he did it.  He's like, not only does he, he's some weird, like, where would you say he's from?  Germany?  No, it's not Germany.  It's probably one of those Nordic countries.  Yeah, something, his name's like Jorgen or something like that.  Yeah.  So, Jorgen sits around and he makes odd weaponry for himself.  He makes slingshots, but not just like he tears a branch down from a tree.  He makes super weird, like, any other, any, if he were in the United States, government agencies would be looking into exactly what he's doing on his weird Nordic compound. 
[03:34:30]  Because he's just, he's fashioning weapons out of wood and bands and screws and stuff like that.  Anybody that has giant ball bearings like he used to shoot out of his slingshot is worth questioning.  Why would anybody have those things?  It's a, when you live in a boring country, you have to entertain yourself. 
[03:35:00]  So, you just go to his hardware store and you're like, you know what?  They have massive steel marbles.  I'm sure I could find a purpose for these.  Yeah, people make, like, potato guns, all that sort of fun stuff.  It's like Homer Simpson when he was shopping for his kids when he had no money on Christmas.  Pads of paper.  Bart could think of a million things to do with these.  And so, Jorgen sits at home making weaponry and, I guess, demoing it on YouTube.  But, obviously, also, he likes to, you know, use movie makeup and video editing and stuff like that. 
[03:35:30]  So, Sal walks in during a commercial break.  Keep in mind, the last time that Sal came in during a commercial break, he ran in.  And I can't remember exactly what it was, but it was to report something that Denny was doing.  And they were like, okay.  And you were very excited, Sal, that day that you did that.  And Denny came in, and it was a bust.  It was a big time, like, who cares?  And, of course, Sal caught some shit for it. 
[03:36:00]  Then, today, he comes in during the commercial break, and he's like, you guys might want to check out this video.  Can I show it to you?  Bah, bah, bah.  And he pulls it up on the computer, and Ant takes a look at it during the commercial break.  Like, and immediately, before any of us brought Sal in, we all knew it was not a real video.  And so, Sal comes in.  He shows us the video.  We watch it with him tonight.  We watch it with him in the studio.  And we're all pretending it's real. 
[03:36:30]  And Sal is acting like it's real, too.  And when we let him in on the fact that this is fake, we all know it's fake.  Fake, fake.  Totally fake.  Fake, Sal acts like, yeah, I know it's fake.  We go, what are you talking about?  And he goes, I was just going to, I was going to tell you guys later.  That's weird.  That's, you're sticking to that.  Yeah.  You, there were two signs of, uh, forgery.  Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Fuck the, the whole concept.  There was two signs that things were going south before I walked in studio. 
[03:37:00]  My original question.  Right.  Okay.  Yeah.  Uh, during the break, I heard, I heard some screaming and all that sort of stuff.  If, you know, we, and was it, was it the typical Anthony going, what is he doing?  I couldn't hear.  I just heard like screaming, like, you know, like something unusual.  Like, so I'm like, what's going on, Travis?  And Travis was like, nothing, nothing, nothing.  So I'm assuming Travis was listening into the, to the studio.  So I was like, okay, that's one, one suspicion.  Okay.  When, yeah, when you hear something and Travis is insisting there's nothing happening, you  go, this isn't good for me.  No, there's something, something's up.  I know exactly what's going on. 
[03:37:30]  And it's not like it's out of the realm of possibility that you're about to get shit  upon.  Right.  I'm always assuming that.  Right.  Why, why like out of the realm?  That's just always understood.  So anyway, and then as soon as I walked in studio, everyone had like a, everyone had like  a very welcoming vibe and a very nice like grin and all that sort of stuff.  I'm like, fuck.  I knew it.  I knew it instantly.  I'm like, this ain't going anywhere.  I'm just going to get killed.  So me, so that's so funny.  So you see right, right through all of our tells.  It's not necessarily tells.  It's just you, you sense it. 
[03:38:00]  You know, you, you just feel that vibe.  As soon as I walked in, I was like, this, this is too welcoming.  Something's not.  If, if, if, if we're welcoming you into this studio going, Hey, Sal's here.  Come on in, Sal.  You know, it's the only reason we could be that happy is because we have something bad  on you.  Yeah.  I'm getting fucked.  Now, did you figure out that what was going on was we all knew it was fake and, or did  you not know?  No, no, no.  I didn't know you guys were doing that to me as of yet.  Like, like I said, after, after I was going to show it and you said, Oh, it was pretty  convincing, blah, blah, blah, whatever. 
[03:38:30]  I was just going to say, yeah, it's, it turns out it's fake.  And that was pretty much it.  And you're, you knew it was fake.  You're saying.  Yes.  And your plan was to what?  Just say after it.  Yeah.  It's pretty convincing, but the video is fake and that's it.  But wouldn't Opie and Anthony then be like, well, why would you not tell us that in  advance?  But how am I going to walk in saying, Hey, there's a fake video.  Let's watch it.  No, they're not going to want to do that.  I guess.  But then why show it to him in the first place?  Cause it was pretty, it was pretty, I thought it was pretty convincing when I first saw it.  I totally believed it. 
[03:39:00]  But you don't think you can go in and be like, there's a pretty convincing video online.  It's tricking a lot of people.  You should take a look at this.  I suppose I could have done that in retrospect.  Yeah.  Because you're never going to get over going like, like trying to stay one step ahead of  the class.  I wasn't trying to stay, I wasn't trying to, you know, outwit them or anything.  It was just that I was going to present it like, yeah, afterwards it turns out.  But that's what, but that's what happens.  You're like, I want, there's a video that I want you to see.  And then in your head, you're going, I know something they don't know. 
[03:39:30]  I mean, I don't have it that, you know, that menacing.  You got to.  But you got to.  Now, you know, I mean, you have to, and I have do this still to this day.  Like when you come in with some content for Opie and Anthony, you have to be thinking,  okay, what are, what's every possible outcome of this scenario?  You have to.  Yeah.  It's the only way to survive.  And you have to be prepared for every possible outcome.  And one of those is going to be, I'm going to have to take some, I'm going to have to 
[03:40:00]  just sit there and take my legs.  Yeah.  They are absolute masters at picking apart every little fine detail and examining, you  know, the, the subtleties of it.  Dude, I've been here for eight or nine years and they'll still pick an angle on something  where it's like, oh fuck.  Like that's what they're going with.  And you get frustrated because you go, what about everything else?  This all works fine.  Wait, wait, no, this is what, how it played out in my head.  And they go, no, buddy. 
[03:40:30]  No, welcome to hell.  Well, I guess that's why it's so entertaining is, you know, you never know what the fuck  is going to happen.  Not for us.  It's not entertaining for us.  It's torture.  Like I got, Jocktober starts tomorrow.  Yes.  I'm very excited about that.  You're excited about it.  Opie and Anthony are excited about it.  All the listeners are excited about it.  Let me tell you, Jocktober is our celebration of all the jocks.  I should get with Troy to make sure we have production ready.  Jocktober is a celebration of all the jocks throughout America and I guess Canada too. 
[03:41:00]  And what we do is we just choose random radio shows that are bad and then make fun of them.  But you know what happens?  I'm the one who has to supply all the content and I've opened this up a million times.  Please, listeners, you can tweet me at NotSam.  You can call into this show.  Any way that you can get a hold of me to suggest radio shows, please do it.  Because I'm being held responsible to find a new show each show. 
[03:41:30]  Like every day of the month, theoretically.  I'm sitting there every year.  I go, Opie, maybe we just do once a week this month.  Maybe this year we just spend October and do Jocktober once a week and keep it fresh.  And he goes, no, I think we'll do it every day.  I think we're going to go every day this year.  And I go, oh, fuck.  Not because I don't want to do the work.  But because without fail, even the shows that are legitimately bad, Opie and Anthony are going to get tired of hearing the same bad show every day. 
[03:42:00]  I've been here for two Jocktobers.  I think it's within 30 seconds of hearing the first show on October 1st.  It's like, oh, my God, why are we doing this again?  Right.  And then what happens is if you don't have some kind of new creative angle on things, they go, Sam, this isn't working.  And they look right at me and I go, oh, no.  I mean, I think we all remember.  And I know people have put it on YouTube. 
[03:42:30]  There was one year where I brought in a show.  And I thought the show fit all the criteria of Jocktober.  But we find out that these guys are fans of Opie and Anthony.  And they call in and they go, yeah, I know our show sucks, but we're fans of you guys.  And they figured out that that is the only way to get out of Jocktober because immediately they spent an hour trashing me instead of them.  And I have to sit there looking through shows all the time.  So I'm sitting there looking down the barrel of a gun. 
[03:43:00]  And people are like, Sam, you know, you're such a prick.  Why are you so obnoxious?  Like, do you understand that especially for Jocktober, if I'm not sitting there trying to pump shit up, trying to hurl out as many insults as I can, trying to make it as bad for somebody else as humanly possible, that that gun is pointed right in my direction.  That's the only way to survive, especially for something like Jocktober when you have to provide this content every single day. 
[03:43:30]  I love Jocktober.  I know.  I mean, when it works, when it works, there's nothing better.  But then it's like and then you have to have a guilty conscience.  And I always have a guilty conscience.  I never mind Jocktober.  But I always feel bad for the Facebook pages.  I know I always laugh and I definitely think it's funny.  But that's the one thing that gets me every time.  I always feel bad when listeners attack Facebook pages because now, like, you've invaded those shows' lives and you've made their day, week, month a horror show. 
[03:44:00]  All their normal, like, hacky, like, radio promotional things and flyers.  And then all of a sudden it's just, like, gaping assholes and, like, scat porn.  It's kind of fun.  Yeah, because it's so easy.  It is so easy to live a life in a town outside of New York, outside of Los Angeles, in some small town somewhere, say Syracuse.  And you've got a moderately popular radio show and you can just get by doing the same schlocky thing every day. 
[03:44:30]  And you leave with a smile on your face and it's all, okay, Mary, we're all great.  And you go home and you spend time with your kids and you have a white picket fence and everything's fine.  And you just lie to yourself about the fact that nothing you do has any integrity.  They can maintain this illusion of anything that I'm doing has any credibility to it whatsoever.  And it's easy. 
[03:45:00]  But then Jacktober comes and they can even ignore Jacktober.  Oh, I hear some big show in New York is bullying us.  That's an easy thing to get by on.  But when it starts infecting your Facebook page, then you're doing your show.  And all of a sudden, truth starts pouring in to you via the Internet, thanks to Mark Zuckerberg.  Truth just starts pouring in in the forms of cockpictures and gaping assholes and defecation and everything else you could imagine. 
[03:45:30]  And you have all this this house of cards, this delicate house of cards that you've built for yourself made of lies comes tumbling down in a hurry.  And it's it's it's not good for a person psychologically to be hit with that much reality in one shot.  No, I think it is good.  And it's mean.  No, it's good because people should know that.  Like, you know.  Yeah.  But you got it.  That shit.  Like, you got to hold someone's hand when they've been. 
[03:46:00]  So and some of these people have been doing it for so long that they don't know how horrible what they're doing really is.  So you kind of got to hold somebody's hand and walk them through this when they get hit with that kind of reality all in one shot.  It's like.  They're going to end up with PTSD.  It's like bad.  It's bad.  Phil in Michigan.  Hey, Sam.  How are you?  What's up, buddy?  Hey, a suggestion for Jack Tover.  WWCK, CK 105 FM out of Flint. 
[03:46:30]  They got a couple 50 year old plus geezers hosting a morning show on a top 40 station.  It's these guys in their 50s.  It's like you're watching.  Like, I can't I can't stop watching X Factor.  I know I should.  But that's the one sort of singy, judgy show that I can't stop watching.  And you watch the show.  And like the 60 year old woman, because there's no age limit on that show. 
[03:47:00]  And inevitably, the 60 year old woman is going to go and audition.  And, you know, it's not going to go well for her because she can't sing.  And she goes up on stage and she's been living this lie where everybody's telling her that they enjoy her.  And she's been smiling for so long, bubbling herself in from any sort of reality.  That she gets up on stage.  And when Simon tells her, you know, you're horrible at this singing thing, he might as well be slamming her in the kneecaps with a sledgehammer. 
[03:47:30]  It's that damaging.  And that's what this is.  You got these like 50 year old dudes.  Is it two guys?  No, it's a guy and a girl.  That's even worse, dude.  Yeah.  Very embarrassing.  And the thing is, one of the low rated weekend TV morning shows has them on on the weekends, you know, about what's hip and what's new at the movies.  And they put them on video and this guy used to be a top 40 jock, all probably 20 plus years ago. 
[03:48:00]  He was cool then.  He's so out of touch now.  It is pathetic to listen to.  It's a cumulus station.  They actually bought some other another top 40 station in a market.  And the rumors going around was they were just going to simulcast because they are so bad.  They have not done it yet.  Because they're so bad.  It's a joke.  But it's like these these 50 year olds, this guy and this girl have never like they know what they're doing is horrible and they know they're way too old to be talking like this. 
[03:48:30]  But they've built up this delusion long enough and they've been kept in that position long enough that they can live in a reality where they are who they are portraying themselves as.  And Jocktober comes along and just crushes dreams and just reminds them exactly of what life has done.  And they've been lying to themselves for so long that they don't know what what's going on in life.  Like they haven't had to keep checking themselves because they found this comfortable position. 
[03:49:00]  The funniest thing though, Sam, is the geezer, the male geezer, for the most part, they'll be talking about the latest in pop stars and Katy Perry or they'll be having banter with, you know, the female news anchor or, you know, weather person.  And he comes across as creepy.  He comes across as Chester the molester.  The weatherman?  Chester the molester.  That's when he comes across as, you know, trying to try to act cool.  And I'm like, you're just making a fool out of yourself, dude. 
[03:49:30]  And, you know, I mean, that said, like everything I've said about, you know, how damaging this can be for somebody.  I'm going to listen to that station.  I mean, that's this is a great tip.  And I thank you, Phil.  And and I mean, and I've been in cars like when I travel around the country, as I do, I'm a bit of a jet setter.  I don't know if you heard, but I listen to other radio stations all the time and they're all horrible.  And I always, you know, write down a little radio station or try to remember it, because all I'm doing is putting in a city and a radio station format and then taking a listen. 
[03:50:00]  And if it's good or if it's decent or if it's whatever, I just skip by it.  But if it's bad, you're in trouble.  Matt in Virginia.  Sammy, the man with the sexy ass mom.  How are you doing?  I think good.  But how are you?  I'm well.  I'm great.  I just got a phone call from my brother maybe 20 minutes ago, and he works in radio in around the D.C. area.  OK.  And the cluster of stations that he's at, he said they've already had a meeting warning all their IT guys to stay on top of the Facebook, stay on top of Twitter because of Jocktober. 
[03:50:30]  They have no idea if one of their shows, one of their stations has been chosen.  But you do have people, at least for this, in the D.C. area, nervous about Jocktober.  Is that true?  Yeah.  My brother called me 20 minutes ago.  That's so cool.  They had a meeting.  He told me that they had already been warning anything that is – he called it – how did he describe it?  That's not show typical, shut down the Facebook and Twitter page immediately. 
[03:51:00]  See, and a part of me – because there is a part of me that sits there going like, why are we going out of our way to ruin people's days?  But then there's another much bigger part of me that takes such pride in the fact that we've been able to accomplish that much.  I think that's a wonderful thing.  I think we should all give ourselves a round of applause.  And I think that there's very few radio stations, radio shows, especially here in New York, that can put fear into the hearts of radio markets around the country. 
[03:51:30]  So thank you, Matt.  You got it, buddy.  Oh, man.  Denny, are you going to be a part of Jocktober this year?  I'll help you out.  It sounds like fun.  Have you been listening to shows?  See, what I want from you –  I haven't done a thing yet.  What do you mean?  I haven't done a thing yet.  You're supposed to be prepared.  I'm working on the Christmas channels.  Who cares about the Christmas channels?  The Christmas channels should be featured on Jocktober.  They're horrible.  You don't like Christmas music? 
[03:52:00]  Christmas music is fine, but what do you need to work on them for?  Just put some Christmas songs on and then you're finished.  How many Christmas songs have been released this year?  Albums are coming out left and right.  Anyone's that are worth playing?  Kelly Clarkson's got a good one.  Just play the same songs that you played last year.  Okay.  You know, just take that line up from last year.  I'm going to bring you into the programming meeting.  Oh, I can't imagine how horrible it must be.  The fact that there's even a programming meeting.  You should raise your hand.  In the next meeting about the Christmas channel here at SiriusXM, you should raise your hand 
[03:52:30]  and say, gentlemen, has anybody thought of just playing the same thing we played last year?  That's a good idea.  I think so.  Bring that up.  It would save a lot of time.  It would save money.  And it would leave you more free time to scan the country looking for shows that you like.  Because that's what I want from you.  Okay.  Is some of your favorite things that radio stations across the country are doing.  I mean, one day you could even bring in some of your favorite jingles.  Oh, yeah.  Now we're talking.  That's the type of thing we could feature on Jocktober. 
[03:53:00]  One day we'll give it to Denny and do Jingle Day.  Okay.  You know, that could be a lot of fun, don't you think?  Oh, that could be a lot of fun.  And maybe listen, figure out some of your favorite bits that are going on.  Some of your favorite go-to marquee bits that radio channels do, radio stations.  And just see how many different shows we can find across the country doing those very bits.  And steal them.  And steal them.  Let's do them ourselves, right?  There we go.  No new ideas.  Just call it something different.  Right.  Right.  Exactly. 
[03:53:30]  War of the Roses.  Diane on Long Island.  Hi.  Hey, it's Jimmy Lover.  How are you?  Oh, good.  How are you?  I have a great idea for Jocktober.  What's that?  All your bloops.  I mean, I don't know if we can...  I want to hear all yours.  That'd be a great day to start off.  Diane, I don't know if we can start off that way, but it's happened before.  And I'm telling you to be...  If that's what you're looking for, that's what I was talking to Sal about.  Be near your radio.  Because the minute any of these Jocktobers go south, all they want to do is throw me under 
[03:54:00]  the bus, Diane.  I know.  I'll be the first one to push you, honey.  Why?  Because I love you.  Thank you.  I appreciate that, Diane.  But if you love me, I wish you wouldn't do that to me.  Denny, do you have any old air checks that I can...  Yeah, I can bring in some stuff.  Can I have some?  And then it'll just be to honor you, really.  No, of course not.  We can destroy them.  That's what we're going to do.  That's what the show's all about.  Can you bring me a few-year-old air checks and stuff?  Of course I can.  Because Jocktober is a time of the year.  I started getting tweets about Jocktober, like station suggestions, in August. 
[03:54:30]  Okay.  I mean, this is how...  If you have some stations, I'll take a list from them.  These Opie and Anthony fans.  Yeah.  After Opie and Anthony live fans, too.  Just love Jocktober.  It's Christmas.  Wow.  You hear Sal...  I mean, Sal has been beaten to the ground on this show.  And well-deserved.  And well-deserved to write about that, Denny.  Fuck you, Dan.  I mean, you got to give Denny some credence to that.  All right, fine.  That was a good jump in.  Did you think that...  Did you hear today's Sal's little blunder? 
[03:55:00]  The video, huh?  Yeah.  That was great.  Did you understand what he was getting at?  I had no idea what was going on.  A friend, a guy I know, told me about it.  Not me, but a guy I know, a friend of mine.  Even if Sal was telling the truth.  He should have taken the onus.  He just should have owned it.  Said, look, I thought it was good.  I screwed up.  Right.  And even if he was telling the truth and he knew it was fake, does it make any sense  to you that you would give them a video you know is fake and just tell them it's  real?  I think he was trying to put one over on the boys.  Right.  But that doesn't...  Even for you...  That's not right.  No, I don't try to put anything over on those guys. 
[03:55:30]  No, it's not a smart thing.  No, no, no, no, no.  Because best case scenario, you get them, it's only going to make them more upset.  It's like Kanye and the Jimmy Kimmel thing.  Yeah.  Jimmy's going to win.  He is.  He is.  He is.  He is going to win.  Jimmy's going to win this thing.  He's going to win this.  Let him have the laugh.  Done.  Yep.  Oh, yeah.  Because you're not going to get one over on him.  See if you can do anything sneaky behind the scenes, whatever you could do.  But if you're trying to beat them at that game...  Man's got to know his limitations.  Never going to happen.  Right.  Like for you, it's all about the Christmas channel. 
[03:56:00]  Yeah, Christmas channel.  Come in here, talk about radio, talk about fun, and that's it.  And that's it.  You're an expert on fun.  That's it.  It's part of the fun patrol.  I'm sure there's a morning show that call themselves that out there.  Yeah, if you could find a fun patrol morning show, that would be great.  Yeah.  Sal, you were not...  You had your hands in the air when Denny walked in today.  I like Denny.  Sal, he waved me in.  I would never just barge in on this new show.  No, I know, I know.  I was just wondering why you were going in.  Everybody's welcome.  I enjoyed what he was talking about, and he waved me in.  Right.  When I see Denny coming up the hall, every time, it's, come on in. 
[03:56:30]  I don't have anything planned.  It was like the Pope, the papal wave.  He sort of just said, come on in.  Let me go to Larry in Louisiana.  And it was very papal of me, wasn't it?  Yes, it was.  Larry.  Sam Roberts, professional broadcaster.  There he is, buddy.  By the way, great call to O&A the other day.  Great call.  Well, Jimmy might have a lot of trouble finding these books.  The book I recommended, and I got to warn him.  I didn't warn him then, and I want to warn him now. 
[03:57:00]  It can be a very, very difficult read.  Some of it's rough.  Well, Larry called in the other day when Jim was talking about Nazi documentaries and some of the books and stuff.  And, yeah, I would assume that reading and watching and, I mean, you know how Jim is.  Like, you don't have to talk to Jim about it being a rough read.  I mean, this is a guy who sits at home watching beheading videos.  You watch beheading videos, Denny?  No, no.  You don't?  No, no, no.  Back in the 70s, they used to have the snuff movies. 
[03:57:30]  Do you watch those?  No.  Faces and Death?  No.  A little bit?  No.  No, the most thing I get out of watching the, from the Nazi prison camps and things, Hogan's Heroes.  You like that?  I like that.  You like Hogan's Heroes?  Because, you know what, they take something that was tragic, but at least they put a fun  spin on it.  Yeah.  I would have liked to have been in the production, the programming meeting back in the 60s.  All right, it's about a concentration camp, but it's a comedy.  You would buy it.  Yeah.  Why not?  Yeah.  Hogan.  You love it.  I love it.  Sal, you a Hogan's Heroes guy?  I don't even know.  He doesn't know. 
[03:58:00]  Sal, I was looking at you.  Who is that?  Colonel?  Colonel Clink.  Colonel Clink.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Sergeant Schultz.  I know nothing.  Oh, Larry, Hogan's Heroes?  I watched it as a young man.  It did receive a lot of criticism at the time for taking something where prisoners were dreadfully  treated and making a comedy out of it.  But, hey, you know, the majority of the people didn't live through that particular experience  and the misfortune of a minority can be uniquely made fun of. 
[03:58:30]  Right.  I mean, Denny got a kick out of it.  Let's show all the German is buffoons, and everybody loves to see a Nazi turned into  a buffoon, the preening in front of General Burkhalter and the fear from the Gestapo man  and the fear from the SS guy.  Is that what you like, Denny?  The Germans being buffoons?  Yeah, it was just a funny show.  Yeah.  You loved it.  Richard Dawson was on that.  Sure.  America first came to find out about him.  Didn't he used to make out with people on Family Feud?  Yeah, I love Richard Dawson.  That's fucking weird, man.  That was so good.  He was a weird dude. 
[03:59:00]  He was just kissing little girls on the lips and stuff.  That's some weird shit.  Am I right?  That's weird.  It was weird when he started doing it.  Yeah, but those women got so excited when they would get a chance to finally kiss him.  They got aroused.  They loved it.  They got very aroused.  But Hogan's Heroes was the same concept of the TV show F Troop.  F Troop was just set back in the days of the Civil War.  Yeah, I don't think about any of these shows.  Well, they're 60s TV shows.  Yeah, I wasn't watching TV in the 60s.  Ant would know.  He could sing you the song.  He could tell you all the characters.  I'm sure he could, but I think I'm about nine generations behind on this conversation. 
[03:59:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And I'm not sure if those shows would be behind me.  I mean, if we're talking about Charles in Charge, if we're talking about Darkwing Duck, I'm right there.  Right.  Well, that's your generation.  Do you know about Darkwing Duck?  No, I don't.  Let's get dangerous.  But I wouldn't go on the radio and talk about it like the guy was talking about the morning show with the old disc jockeys.  Right.  You're not going to do that.  How about that swinging T-Pain?  He's coming up now.  You can't do that.  No, you sound like a fucking asshole.  Exactly.  I mean, you're not going to say those words.  No.  But the sentiment is there.  Yeah.  You're going to stick to the 60s channel.  Exactly.  Because that's your shit.  60s, 70s, sure. 
[04:00:00]  Right.  So what's going on, Larry?  Well, Sam, I'm mystified as to how you could possibly become a subject for Jocktober.  I've never heard you made an error.  After all, you are a professional broadcaster, first and foremost, as well as being Sam Roberts.  You're Sam Roberts.  Thank you, Larry.  I need you to thank you for my affirmation.  I appreciate the call.  Hey, Sammy, you the man.  You know that.  You are Sam Roberts.  I'll talk to you later, buddy.  And by the way, one more thing. 
[04:00:30]  You are a world-renowned professional wrestling expert and originator of the blatantly stolen Lonely Virgil concept.  That's exactly right.  Thank you, Larry.  You see, Denny, you need people like Larry in your life to remind you.  You need that confidence up and –  You got him on the payroll, huh?  No.  No.  No.  He's just a guy who tells it like it is.  He's good.  Yeah.  He's a good caller.  No.  A lot of –  He's smart, too.  He knew a lot of stuff, but he was talking about the Nazis with Jim last week and – 
[04:01:00]  You like Larry.  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  Good, good.  What do you think of Larry, Sal?  He's all right.  He's all right.  Denny, though?  I liked him the other day when he was talking about the history of like Jeremy and so forth.  Yeah, I just said that.  You know what?  Denny was just saying.  You didn't have to be repetitive about it.  Oh, I'm sorry because Sam asked me my opinion, so Denny's got to fucking open his mouth.  Salty, huh?  Wow.  No need for the potty mouth here.  What's a potty mouth?  What's a potty mouth?  You fucking dope.  A potty mouth.  He said potty mouth, though.  Potty mouth.  It's not like you to make a mistake. 
[04:01:30]  Potty mouth.  That's why taping for the music show is a little easier.  You could go over and gloss it.  Oh, pre-producing.  Yeah.  You like that?  I'd do that.  Sure.  Sure.  Why not?  Perfection.  Kevin in Arizona.  Hey, thanks, Tim.  Hey, Matt.  I've got one for you.  94 Rock in Albuquerque.  94.1.  Their morning show consists of Swami Rob, the Rain Man, and Skyler.  Skyler for Breaking Bad? 
[04:02:00]  No, I don't.  I'm saying I know one Skyler who lives in Albuquerque, and that's Skyler White.  Oh, no.  No.  It's not her?  This is just, no, no.  No.  It would be a vast improvement if it was, but this is just, they took over for a guy, but  he went by T.J. Trout.  T.J. Trout.  You like that name, Denny?  It's just, no.  It's just bad.  I was flipping through the channels one day. 
[04:02:30]  I've been listening to, you know, you guys since I got asked them years ago, and I hadn't  listened to this show, and I was just flipping through the channels the other day, and I heard  this, and it's like, you've got to be kidding.  I can't see how anybody listens to this for shit anymore.  Well, I'm going to have to listen to it.  Thank you, Kevin, and I'll look into it, and that's the thing about Jocktober.  It's so funny, because you hear from people who, for years, have had these same radio shows  on in their areas, and they feel like they're being held hostage, like they're being forced 
[04:03:00]  to listen to this shit.  And this is, you get calls like this every time.  It's like it's the only pizza parlor in town, so it's the best.  That's right, even though they piss all over their pizza before they serve it to you.  That's not grease.  Soggy.  I know.  It is soggy.  Listen, Ron and Fez are coming up next.  That is a wonderful radio show, so stay tuned for that.  We'll be back with more of this drivel tomorrow.  You were on, and now you're gone.  Thank you, Denny. </pre>
