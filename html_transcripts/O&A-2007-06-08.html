<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about Paris Hilton's early release from jail, sparking a debate about the influence of wealth and fame on the justice system, using O.J. Simpson and Martha Stewart as examples.  This segued into a conversation about the lack of police presence and community cooperation in high-crime areas of New York City, prompting a call from a police officer.  The hosts then played an audio clip of an awkward interview with the Spelling Bee champion, followed by a recounting of Rich Voss’s failed Michael Bolton joke.  They also announced the return of the "Red Rum shower cam" segment and heavily promoted their upcoming "ONA Traveling Virus Comic Tour" at Jones Beach, mentioning several participating comedians and the $10 ticket sale starting at 9 am via Ticketmaster.  Studio guests included Rich Voss and his pregnant wife, Bonnie, Stalker Patty, and later, Billy Connolly.  The show also touched upon a Boston radio delay and Curt Schilling's near no-hitter for the Red Sox.

The show continued with a darkly humorous account of Voss's experience with Bonnie's injury requiring an ambulance, including fabricated stories about disposing of a bloodied person.  This was followed by a recollection of Voss's past on-air mispronunciations (like "hysterectomile" and "tortillias") and nonsensical comments.  Stalker Patty, present in the studio for her birthday, was the subject of significant ribbing about her age, social skills, and lack of family and gifts. A listener's request for a "rock scream" from Patty led to a humorous exchange involving headphones.  Her alleged online IQ score of 132 was questioned.  The hosts arranged a birthday shopping spree for Patty with show employee Danny. Voss’s upcoming stand-up performance at the Stress Factory was briefly mentioned.

The "Story of the Day" involved a wheelchair-bound man who rode on the front grill of a moving semi-truck for several miles.  911 calls detailing the incident were played, showcasing the callers' contrasting reactions.  Billy Connolly joined the conversation, sharing anecdotes about avoiding unwanted attention. He also promoted his new zombie movie, *Fido*.  The hosts speculated on the ending of *The Sopranos* and recounted their history of spoiling books and movies with bullhorns.  Further jokes about Stalker Patty concluded this segment abruptly.

A significant portion of the show focused on Stalker Patty's birthday shopping spree, documenting her visit to an adult bookstore and her selection of a vibrator, with the hosts providing detailed and often vulgar commentary on her purchases and reactions.  This segment also included a lengthy discussion and replay of the bizarre 911 call about the wheelchair-bound man and the truck, along with an interview with the unharmed man.  Guests Billy Connolly (promoting *Fido*), Rich Voss, and Bonnie remained in the studio throughout this segment. The show continued to promote the Jones Beach comedy show.  The entire segment was characterized by vulgar language and sexually explicit descriptions.

[00:05:00]  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much. 
[00:05:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:06:00]  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  I'd have to say, hey, how about a fresca?  My favorite.  What an awful bunch of stuff or something. 
[00:06:30]  Fresca.  But he says it like, huh?  Yeah.  It's arrived.  Yeah, I know.  We're pals.  How about a fresca?  How about a fresca?  Fresca.  So don't forget, $10 tickets, 9 o'clock this morning, through Ticketmaster,  for the ONA Traveling Virus Comic Tour at Jones Beach a week from tomorrow, okay?  Good.  So write that down somewhere.  Goodly.  And once again, brought to you by Bud Light.  Always worth it. 
[00:07:00]  Well, the big news, and it happened as we were talking to Nicole Richie yesterday.  Yeah, boy, if we would have gotten...  Thanks for nothing, Nicole.  A few more seconds of airtime, we would have been able to break that to Nicole Richie on the phone and say,  hey, by the way, Paris out of jail.  No, this is why Nicole Richie stinks, even though we had a good interview with her yesterday.  Great.  I found out everything about the big clay head from Lionel Richie's hello video.  So everything I've ever wanted to know.  For years, I've been sitting on that.  That was a great angle to take with her.  Love the big clay head. 
[00:07:30]  But as she's talking about the simple life and all that and the clay head and trying to keep calm when I said that she looks hotter when she's chubby.  A little chubby.  Well, that's why I was hoping she was pregnant, because there's rumors out there.  And I said, well, I hope you're pregnant, because you look a lot hotter when you're chubby.  Hotter chubby.  She took it like a champ, though.  I guarantee, while she was talking to us yesterday on the radio, she was getting text messages that Paris was free.  Because it was all going down very early yesterday while we were on the radio. 
[00:08:00]  So Paris is free, and there is outrage all over the place.  Outrage.  I'm outraged.  Are you outraged?  Oh, my God.  Can you be outraged?  Dude.  I don't think we're allowed to be outraged.  I am outraged, because I never had money.  This is about money and fame, like you were just saying before the mics went on.  Yeah.  It's about money and fame.  And don't bring color into it, because I read a few things in the paper, and it has something to do with her being a white girl and all that. 
[00:08:30]  No.  No.  It's more about money and fame.  It's absolutely about money and fame.  I think color is in it, too.  Stop it.  I do.  How?  Because, like, she's just a little rich, spoiled white brat.  And that's, it does, I think, you know, I just can't see it.  Well, look at people like R. Kelly.  That's true.  Who got away with what he did.  Jesus Christ.  This is bad videography.  Yeah. 
[00:09:00]  Bobby Brown.  True.  Well, you've got to go with the biggie.  What?  O.J.  O.J., I was, of course, that was my big closer.  My big closer was the O.J.  O.J. was all about his notoriety and his money.  He got a ton of money to hire an unbelievable legal team up against the bumbling L.A. prosecution. 
[00:09:30]  And it was all about his money and his fame.  It had nothing to do with race.  And this Paris thing is the same thing.  What about, who was the model recently that had to do community service?  Naomi Campbell threw something at her maid or it was some problem with her domestic, her domestic help.  And she didn't go to jail for it.  She had to pick up garbage for a few days. 
[00:10:00]  That's what they do to celebrities when they get in trouble.  It doesn't matter what color they are.  It's how rich you are and how much fame you have.  I was amazed that she even made it to jail with all the power and money that family has.  Yeah.  So they couldn't get the job done before she got in there.  And it took another, what, four or five days.  And they finally figured out something to get her out.  It's so obvious.  It went, didn't this go a little far without a bunch of appeals and a bunch of this, that, and the other thing?  I think on the outset it sounded like a good publicity stunt idea for her. 
[00:10:30]  Like, hey, look, Paris goes to jail for a little while and it's going to be kind of a cool thing to get her name in the news.  And then when the reality sunk in, when you hear the head and the door shuts and she was cold in the cell and the food was bad and it's lonely, you know.  And then she started realizing, uh-oh, there's a problem here.  Get my lawyers to work. 
[00:11:00]  The lawyers started working on some people and getting, you know, the health angle because that's what they went with.  They brought a psychiatrist in, said she was suicidal.  And the sheriff decided that he was going to let her go home with an ankle bracelet on and serve out 40 days of her sentence.  Well, she's under mansion arrest.  Yeah, mansion arrest.  Yes, that's coming in a lot.  Thank you, Kevin and everyone else.  Yeah.  Coming in with that one.  It's not like she was in danger because they said she was locked down for 23 hours and out for an hour. 
[00:11:30]  I can see them not wanting her to mix with general population because she is famous.  And if she got her face slashed or she got, you know, that could be really bad looking bad.  I mean, if she got really hurt badly.  Oh, there were worries about staph infection in the place, rashes and staph infection.  Have you seen her videos?  That's the least of her worries of staph infection.  What kind of infection you're going to get?  She's going to get conjunctivitis from what just went in her eye.  Just do the time. 
[00:12:00]  Do you know what it says here?  Here's the explanation.  She was crying a lot, the medical provider said.  She was depressed.  I don't belong here.  I don't belong here.  I want my mommy.  Is that a real way?  She was Anthony when he was a kid.  Yes.  Is that a real way?  Just a whiny crybaby.  Yeah.  I needed that head, the head screw in the prison to beat me senseless.  Hey, go to jail for DUI and all the stuff that she went to jail for, and then try the crying 
[00:12:30]  thing and see if you get out early.  Yeah, I don't think it works.  No, it's not going to work.  Say you're suicidal.  Say you need to talk to a therapist, which she was doing, what, three or four, five, six,  ten times a day, whatever it was.  She was driving them insane is what happened.  She drove them insane to the point that, like, oh, my God, just come up with you.  Get her out of here.  Get her out of here.  But other people on the other side of this are saying that it's ridiculous that she got  jail time in the first place, and it was wasting jail space for people that actually 
[00:13:00]  might have been a danger or could have been kept behind bars.  Oh, man.  She was drunk driving, which to me is a big problem.  Nothing happened to her.  She went to jail for that.  But then when you're flagrantly driving, especially with her money, where she can just hire someone  to drive her on the revoke list, and then you're just arrogant about it.  It was like Martha Stewart went to jail for her arrogance as opposed to what she did.  I think if she hadn't lied all along, she probably wouldn't have went.  And if dummy hadn't been so...  It's like you can't just flaunt that in front of the LAPD that, like, they're going to take 
[00:13:30]  away your license or whatever, and you're just going to drive anyway.  They have to do something.  Well, how about that?  You know, Martha Stewart, she has fame and a hell of a lot of cash, and she did all of  her time.  Five months, yeah.  Yeah, she did five months.  She did an easy five months.  Let me tell you something.  She was making stuff with the inmates, if you follow that story.  They were making Afghans and stuff, and it was like a country club.  It's still...  It's still prison.  It's still prison.  A little shank carriers.  Shank carriers, crocheted.  Dude, it was barely prison. 
[00:14:00]  Did you see the video of Martha Stewart walking around?  It looked like a country farm.  Look, you're hysterical.  It would be lucky.  Most people would be lucky to live how she did in, quote, prison.  I don't care what the thing is.  If it's prison, it stinks, and I want no part of it, and Martha did her time.  I don't care what the hell the place was.  Oh, please.  She'd do it for her.  She was, again, not a violent criminal.  I mean, she shouldn't have went anyway.  I don't think Martha Stewart should have went to jail at all.  You know what, though?  When someone like Reverend Al comes out and talks about race in there, I don't... 
[00:14:30]  I'm not buying it.  I'm sorry.  It's wealth and fame, and if you happen to be white or black, that's going to play into  things and going to help you out when sentencing comes around.  That's just the way it is.  It's wealth and fame and has nothing to do with color at this level.  You know, you could debate the fact that at the average Joe level that it makes a difference 
[00:15:00]  if you're white or black.  That's a debatable fact.  I'll give him that, but not in this case.  And maybe Al, you know, for him to comment on this situation when here in New York seven  black people were gunned down in one day, his lack of outrage in that is amazing.  I was listening to 1010 Winds on the way in, and there were people in the communities where 
[00:15:30]  these killings happened yesterday just screaming that the police aren't here.  The police aren't here.  There's drugs.  There's people being killed.  Where are the police to stop this?  And I started thinking, like, where are the police?  The police really don't have the gumption to go into these neighborhoods and enforce the  law anymore because there's a good possibility they could end up in jail. 
[00:16:00]  Not just ruining your career or, you know, going home or having to get a security job or something.  End up in prison because they might have to shoot somebody and something happens because  any time a cop shoots a minority, there's a problem.  But apparently, gangs, drug dealers, they could shoot however many people of color they please  and there's never this outrage.  There's never a march.  There's never, hey, why can't we as a people get together and stop this? 
[00:16:30]  And that's the thing that just really irks me when it comes to these civil rights leaders,  these self-anointed and appointed civil rights leaders.  Where are they when seven people in New York City were killed by gunfire?  In 24 hours?  Yeah.  Wow.  And then people are screaming, where are the police?  The police are now put in this situation that a lot of, and I don't want to make this seem 
[00:17:00]  any less important than it is.  These are dead people we're talking about.  But when you look at the radio industry, a lot of people have lost careers over a couple  of years from people being outraged.  It seems to me that the police are put in a similar situation where instead of wanting  to take a chance to make things better and go into a neighborhood and maybe try to clean 
[00:17:30]  up an area of drug dealers and killers, they might say to themselves now, you know, screw  this.  Why am I going to jeopardize my life, not even my career, my life?  I could end up in jail if I go in and try to protect these people.  So they're not doing it as much as they used to, is what the stats are saying.  And the neighborhood, I mean, let's be honest. 
[00:18:00]  You see a lot of times the cops arresting somebody in the projects and there's 75 people  around screaming, taunting the cops, throwing crap at them.  It's like, what are you supposed to do?  And then if you pick out a nightstick or you pull out your weapon, you know, you're in civil  rights violation.  There's no way to win.  There's no way to win.  So why would they put themselves in this situation?  Well, because it's their job.  Yeah, it's their job.  But if you do your job, there are a few times, and please, barring any circumstance where 
[00:18:30]  it is a blatant miscalculation or a very bad move by a cop with a shooting, I'm just talking  about cops going in, like Jimmy said, they're taunted, they're not allowed.  They said during these recent shootings, they're getting no cooperation from the community.  Okay, how are you supposed to get these people off the street and make sure your neighborhoods  are safer?  Because there are, you know, families here that are worried about it. 
[00:19:00]  Legitimate families living there that are worried about their kids and everything else.  But they're the ones getting hurt because the cops aren't going into these areas anymore.  But not cooperating with the cops, all of a sudden, who do these people think they are?  Like Italians?  Right, exactly.  We got a cop on the line.  What's up?  You're on the Opie and Anthony show.  I don't know your name, sir.  What's up, gentlemen?  Hey, what's up?  Hello, sir.  Not for nothing, I work all over the city.  And we'll get profiles in certain areas where, okay, there's shootings here. 
[00:19:30]  We're going to go and target this.  There's robberies here.  But then as soon as we go into these areas and you start asking people questions and you  want it better the neighborhood, they're like, yo, don't hassle me.  Don't harass me.  We'll kill it.  Well, that's just it.  You start making stops.  You start looking at suspicious activity.  That cops, believe me, they know when people are dealing drugs.  They know the areas.  They know the people.  They've seen them before.  They got previous arrests.  And the second they make a move to try to get these people off the street, unless they're 
[00:20:00]  being shot at, unless the police are being shot at at this point, there's a problem with  any move they make to frisk people, to make sure they're not selling drugs, to follow  up on leads that people might be selling drugs.  And it ends with a day like yesterday where numerous people are just gunned down in the  street and then the people start complaining that there's not enough police protection.  I'm a little confused.  They did this because Paris Hilton got out? 
[00:20:30]  Exactly.  It was the Paris Hilton.  There was a lot of outrage.  There were supporters.  Yes.  Yes.  All I know is we went from Paris Hilton to...  Well, because Reverend Al threw his hat into the ring here, commenting on Paris and stuff,  where, meanwhile, he should be outraged and rallying the community that he says he represents  and figuring out why black people are killing other black people in such large numbers like  this.  Sharpton, though, in this one was probably... 
[00:21:00]  Because you know what just scum the media are and how they just love to stir things up.  I don't think Sharpton really went out of his way to comment.  They probably called him because he said, like, I think that it's both another glaring  display of how race and money seem to get different treatments.  There seems to be a different criminal justice system for some than others.  That's probably what he said.  And that I'll give him.  That's true.  There is a different criminal justice system for some than others.  Wealthy.  Famous.  I won't say the race has nothing to do with it, but I don't think that's true. 
[00:21:30]  Not at that level.  Not at that level.  If you want to bitch about it, there are plenty of other glaring examples you could probably  point out aside from that.  But, you know, you bring up a good point, Jim.  The media, in their feeding frenzy, probably did call him up and just want some kind of  comment so they could stir the pot.  You're right.  It seemed like an answer he gave as opposed to, like, a rally cry.  Right.  We've got to take a break.  So Paris is out, and they're trying to throw her back in jail, by the way.  There's a lot of outrage.  Yes.  And they're going after the prosecutors. 
[00:22:00]  No, they're going after the sheriff, actually, that signed off on releasing her.  But, I mean, the prosecutor's jumping back on board.  Like, what are you doing?  And the judge that made the initial sentencing, he's very angry with this, that it was overturned.  But he's probably just some guy that looks at her and goes, I'd never get a piece like  that.  Right, right.  And it annoys me and put her in jail.  Ankle bracelet in her mansion.  That's a tough sentence right there.  Mansion arrest.  So I think they're going to bring her back to court today.  And don't be surprised if they throw her back in. 
[00:22:30]  I sentence myself to the same thing every day at about 10 a.m.  If they throw her back in jail, you want to talk about a taunting, this dummy, she should  have just stayed there, shut her mouth, three weeks, she would have been out.  You know what I say?  Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.  Oh, very, very good.  Don't do it.  Very good.  All right, we're just getting started.  And keep your eye on the sparrow.  When the going gets narrow.  How appropriate to keep your eye on the eyes. 
[00:23:00]  Keep the correct eye.  Everyone is having fun with the Paris thing.  Our buddy Leno is just on fire.  Yeah.  As we go to break, here's some Paris Hilton stuff from Leno.  And folks, our long national nightmare is over.  Paris Hilton has been freed.  Apparently, everyone in jail couldn't stand her either.  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  She'll now spend 40 days under house arrest.  Oh, shut up.  Have you seen her house?  Couldn't they have punished her a little more than that?  At least give her guest house arrest, okay?  Stay in the little guest house near the pool.  No, they said Paris was released for medical reasons.  She suffers from a rare disorder only trust fund babies get.  I believe it's called rich bitch-itis.  Hey, good morning. 
[00:24:00]  Lots to do today.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We'll give the phone number out.  It's a very interactive show.  We love your phone calls.  877-212-5762.  Don't forget, today it's Air Guitar Friday.  And starting at 9 o'clock.  Hold on, hold on, Jimmy.  It's also Point and Laugh Friday.  Let's not forget.  And Mispronunciation Friday as well.  Yes, Jimmy, go ahead.  Well, we have Took It on sale starting at 9 a.m. 
[00:24:30]  for Jim's Beach.  See, mispronunciation.  You're mispronouncing it.  I'm going to point at you and laugh.  While you were doing that, I was playing air guitar.  Wow.  It should have been beat the joke into the ground Friday.  Friday, baby.  $10 tickets for Jones Beach, which is the 16th.  They're on sale.  9 a.m.  It really is a thank you for the way the fans have been disgustingly supportive.  Yes.  Affectionately.  So thank you guys very much.  And there's a very limited amount of tickets going on sale for $10. 
[00:25:00]  We really want to do something nice for the fans here in the New York area.  So we figure we'd, I don't know, have 10 or 12 tickets on sale for $10 each.  10 or 12?  And these are not, there is no lawn seats at Jones Beach.  No.  They're actually all for, I think, covered tickets.  Yes.  So it's brought to you by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  But basically, $10 tickets going on sale for the Jones Beach show, which is a week from tomorrow.  You got Bob Kelly on the lineup, Bob Saget, Frank Caliendo, Jim Norton, Louis C.K., Otto and George, Patrice O'Neill, Rich Voss, Stephen Lynch. 
[00:25:30]  Then you got the O&A Village, the tailgating, all for just 10 buckaroos.  That would be cool, man.  Say clams.  10 clams.  10 clams, man.  I like it when you're jazzy.  9 o'clock, they go on sale through Ticketmaster.  Make sure you're on the phones right away, because they're going to go really fast.  And when they're gone, that's it.  We can't do any more specials, okay?  King James lost.  Yeah.  Who?  King James.  Oh.  King James, Anthony. 
[00:26:00]  Please.  That's that basketball guy.  Well, Cleveland's going to have a really tough time with the Spurs.  Spurs, I mean, their lineup is just stacked.  Just ridiculous.  Is it?  But I'm pushing for the Cavaliers.  Is Michael Jordan with that team?  You're not that dumb, are you?  You know a little bit about everything.  I hear that Michael Jordan kid is pretty good.  You've got to at least know that much.  And while we're talking about sports, hello, Boston.  Hello, Boston.  Yeah. 
[00:26:30]  I got an email yesterday, actually, from somebody in the company.  And they said, check out the Red Sox game.  Kurt Schilling has a no-hitter going into the ninth.  Oops.  So I go and check out the Red Sox game, because someone told me to.  And whoever sent out this email, I don't know his name right now, he jinxed it for Kurt,  because two outs in the ninth.  Goodbye, no-hitter.  And I think he waved off a pitch.  Rumor has it.  Yes.  Is that what happened?  What do you know, Thane?  Quickly, Thane.  Yeah, he waved off Veritek's first pitch suggestion. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, boy.  And threw what he wanted.  He coughed it up.  Well, I'm sure he did that throughout the game, too.  I mean, that probably wasn't the first wave-off he did.  I'm sure these guys wave off every at-bat, almost.  Yeah.  But apparently he's beating himself up over the fact that he waved off that pitch.  But then again, if he didn't, he'd be beating up Veritek in his own head.  And I don't know why I'm yelling at you.  You're not the guy.  Stop yelling, Jimmy.  I have a really mixed review, because I don't like Schilling.  I despise him when he's with the Phillies.  He's spiced.  And I don't like him now.  So I'm glad.  Why don't you like Schilling?  Bloody socks. 
[00:27:30]  Shut up.  Because he hurt my team badly when they were my team.  Yeah.  I can never like him.  Like, I can never like stupid A-Rod.  He's not a Yankee.  He's a Mariner.  Schilling is a very, very old friend of mine.  So old of a friend of mine that he probably wouldn't even remember me.  That's how old, and that's how far back we go.  Schilling.  Good house.  Well, we used to drink together in Rochester with Brother Weasel, the gang, when he was  playing for the Rochester Red Wings.  He's a great guy.  Is he?  Oh, yeah.  Nothing but the best for Kurt Schilling.  Good.  You know, he never had a no-hitter.  I didn't know that.  No.  As I was reading about the game this morning. 
[00:28:00]  Because God hates him.  That's all right.  He killed the Yankees.  What was it?  What was it?  0-4 was 3-0, and I hate Schilling.  With his stupid, bloody foot.  Awful.  The rumors came out that that was fake.  That it was fake for drama.  Was it?  A rumor.  Rumors.  It's another one of these conspiracy theories.  We'll never know the answer, just like the JFK thing that we were just talking about  during the break.  Manny's, people know Manny from the cellar. 
[00:28:30]  JFK never threw a no-hitter either.  If that's rumor, I'll say it right now.  He actually threw a two-hitter.  One to the throat, one to the back of the head.  Get out of here.  Give me those ribs.  And Noam, who's Manny's son.  Manny was an arch-conservative, and he was an Oswald.  He believed Oswald did it.  He would always argue about it at the cellar.  And Noam bought me this book by Vincent, though, who did the prosecution, what, the Bugliosi?  Yeah.  It was like a 1,600-  Skelter-skelter.  Right, for the Manson trial.  Yeah.  And he bought me this 1,600-page book about the JFK assassination. 
[00:29:00]  I'm like, oh, that was nice.  And now I found out today that it's to prove Oswald.  Yeah, it's pretty much just to prove that.  So why don't you go burn that book?  No, I want to read it.  Conspiracies are-  The problem is too much time has gone by, and now things are way too foggy to really  get to the bottom of it.  Yeah, we'll never know.  A lot of the witnesses are dead or way too old to really remember.  And it's just like, I can't get- I can't- I can't be bothered with new info as far as  the JFK thing goes.  I'll tell you what works, though, with JFK stuff is the computer animation is so good.  Now, computer stuff is they do stuff with- if you know the conspiracy, there's something 
[00:29:30]  a guy called, I think it was Black Dog Man, which is one of the shots, it looks like there's  a little black silhouette of a figure who people say is wearing a police badge who might have  done some shooting behind the- in the grassy knoll.  Behind the fence?  Yes, and that was it for many years, the conspiracy theorists grabbed on to that guy, but computer  graphics have done a lot of stuff, and they say that the computer shows that if this guy  was actually a guy, he'd be two feet tall.  Oh, really?  Yeah, like that's one thing that-  So what is it then?  It's just a shadow, I think. 
[00:30:00]  Just a shadow.  Something, I mean.  But computer graphics have gotten better.  Yeah.  So the better- so you kind of do get a teeny bit more info.  Well, I saw this show on Discovery where they set up a bunch of targets of ballistic- they  used that ballistic rubbery stuff to make people out of, and they set up a Kennedy and  a Connolly in the car and everything, and then fired a shot, and went to see if that magic  bullet could actually hit all the areas that it supposedly hit, and it pretty much did. 
[00:30:30]  So it's possible?  Yeah, it was definitely plausible.  I have no idea what you said, because the pal talker is beyond excited today, because  it's the return of the Red Rum shower cam.  Oh, I love her.  The Red Rum shower cam has returned.  I guess she took some time off to have a kid or something, and now she's feeling good enough  about her body to let us watch her shower again. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, there we go.  I got there just in time to see her scrubbing the good parts.  Her bosoms are shiny.  Thank goodness for the pal talk.  For the newbies, Red Rum used to shower for us pretty much every morning through the pal  talk cameras.  You know, you got the people with their pal talk cameras.  They get to watch us as we do our radio show.  We get to watch them listen to the radio show and do other things like shower.  And Red Rum went away for a long time because she went and had a kid.  Yeah.  Didn't feel like her body was up to speed or something. 
[00:31:30]  I don't know.  But now she's feeling confident enough to bring back the shower.  Snapped back.  And she's looking fine.  Is she going to be doing any shaving today?  We'll have to wait and see.  Brooklyn Ace, what's up?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  Opie, you turned around and said you're going all the way for the Cavaliers.  Sorry, Cleveland.  I'm really sorry to you.  Oh, that's right.  The Opie sports jinx.  Wait, is it 1-0 now the game?  The series?  Huh?  1-0 series?  Yeah, yeah.  It just began.  Yeah, well, there goes my sports curse again. 
[00:32:00]  Yep.  I do go for a lot of underdogs, though.  I want to defend myself.  Oh, is that it?  Spurs are heavily favored in that.  All right.  Moving on.  I'm starting to really wonder what the hell Boston is doing with this radio show.  They're telling me now that by the end of the show, they're 10 minutes behind.  10 minutes?  10 minutes behind the actual broadcast.  They can't be.  That is not smart, if that's true.  So, right now...  We've got to talk to someone in Boston, see if it's true, because I don't want to, you  know...  Here's how to figure it out. 
[00:32:30]  We need a couple of fans, to be honest with us.  Right now, as I'm saying this, it's 6.40.  So, as you hear this, tell me, look at your clock and tell me what time it is through,  like, instantly.  Well, it's not bad right now.  Supposedly, as the show goes on, they add more and more promos or maybe some commercials  or maybe local content.  I don't know exactly what they're doing.  But by the end of the show, they're 10 minutes behind.  Wow.  This show has too much clutter to begin with.  You can't add more clutter to this show.  That is ridiculous.  We'll get to the bottom of it and try to find out what's going on. 
[00:33:00]  Bottom.  Well, I mean, if you want...  We're trying to do a very interactive radio show.  So, we kind of need the show to be as close to live as possible.  We understand there's some delays to protect us and this and that, blah, blah, blah, and  a network delay.  We get that.  But if you're adding more and more onto that...  Because I wonder, some mornings, like, why don't we get a lot of calls from Boston?  It's because they're, like, 10 minutes behind the subjects.  Yeah.  That's great.  By the end of the show.  They actually called to discuss the sex for St. Pat's thing yesterday. 
[00:33:30]  Hey, this is a quickie.  By the way, we've got Rich Voss and Bonnie.  They're in the green room.  They're coming in to hang with us today.  Also, we've got...  She's pregnant.  She's pregnant.  She's very pregnant.  She's very pregnant.  And we've got Billy Connolly coming in at 8 o'clock.  He's one of our favorite guests.  He is hilarious.  He's a funny dude, man.  One of the best things he ever said...  Remember he was talking about...  He noticed that we just beat the hell out of our listeners.  And he said it was just pure brilliance.  It's brilliant.  It's brilliant.  They hate their listeners. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  So I can't wait to see what he's been up to.  We've got Carl Smitz calling to talk about the ONA Childing Virus Comedy Tour.  We've got Stalker Patty.  Is she here yet?  I think we're doing something special with Stalker Patty as well.  So...  But we have this...  She's here.  Oh, she is here?  Okay.  Oh, thank goodness.  We want to get this out of the way.  This is hilarious.  The Spelling Bee Champion.  Travis found this?  Yes.  Travis, man.  This was a great find.  Oh, God.  We were laughing so hard in the office getting ready for today's show. 
[00:34:30]  The Spelling Bee Champion goes on CNN.  And there's one of the most awkward and horrible interviews ever to be done on CNN.  Yeah.  The newsreader, you know, they think, I could do this interview.  I'm going to wing it with a kid.  It'll be great.  Hey, Henry, I got this one.  Don't worry about it.  Kids say the darndest things and I'll be able to riff with the kid.  It'll be funny.  It'll be like a Letterman segment when he has a kid on. 
[00:35:00]  So, Spelling Bee Champion, the CNN anchor, some woman, I don't know her name, split  screen with the kid.  And the kid is giving up nothing.  There's this awkward silence.  And she gets, you can just see how uncomfortable she's getting as the interview goes on.  You know why?  This kid is like one of the, he's an Uber nerd.  He's an Uber nerd who obviously has some type of social skill difficulty.  Yeah.  Because I gather he's homeschooled.  We learned that from the little interview. 
[00:35:30]  And he doesn't really, it doesn't seem like he knows how to communicate with people.  Why the interview?  I'm sorry, why?  He won the Spelling Bee.  He's the type of kid, he could tackle like, you know, college chemistry at eight years old.  Oh, yeah.  But he can't have a conversation with a girl.  Yeah.  You know, we've all had these kids in school when we were growing up.  Can he spell, can he define D-O-U-C-H-E?  Because that's what he is.  I'm just spelling properly, you little dork.  Well, this is just so worth playing today. 
[00:36:00]  Here we go.  Reporter introduces kid and gets his name wrong.  And listen to the kid.  Well, here he is, America's newest letterman, beating 285 other spellers to win it all.  Evan Dorney, the 13-year-old king of the words.  He had no problem taking the crown as America's Spelling Bee champ.  Evan joins us this morning.  He is from Danville, California.  He joins us from Washington on the morning after.  Evan, thanks for being with us.  You're welcome.  Did you say my name wrong? 
[00:36:30]  My name is Evan O'Dorney.  Evan O'Dorney.  I am sorry if I said it wrong.  That's just the beginning.  Believe me.  Did you say my name wrong?  Almost sounds like Sam.  It's Evan O'Dorney.  I got a camera.  My head's full of candy.  See, we all have different priorities.  You know, someone can pronounce my name wrong.  I'm like, whatever.  But for a kid like that, it's everything.  Like, hey, I'm on the news.  Hey, hey, hey. 
[00:37:00]  Evan was a surprise he won.  What did it feel like when you heard the word and you knew that you knew how to spell it?  Um, I saw that I was going to win.  And I just saw that because I had been studying really hard for two years, it just seemed like a natural conclusion.  Were you surprised that you won?  Not really.  I know what he is.  I wasn't surprised that you won either.  You were quite confident.  He's, he's somebody going through a sex change operation. 
[00:37:30]  Just, I love the kid's voice.  It sounds like he's the worst person alive.  I want, I want his voice on my iPod.  It's that damn good.  I, uh.  He is somebody trapped in the body of the other gender.  It can go either way.  Yeah.  And he doesn't know how to, like, handle anything with any tact or, like, she'll say something and he'll pretty much just be, no, you're an idiot. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  I, I knew I was going to win.  Right.  I hope this kid will be ruling the world in another decade.  Oh, he's horrid.  Evan describes training for the bee in a long, boring way.  What do you do to train for a spelling bee?  Spell?  Well, we've gone through the dictionary and written down any of the words that we think I might have trouble with.  And so, um, and during the phase of the dictionary, we don't attempt any memorization. 
[00:38:30]  And then, um, uh, once we've gotten through the dictionary, uh, we started to use different coloring systems to help me remember the words and indicate which words were still giving me trouble.  Oh, my God.  And, and, and I feel that, that if God had his way, he would have given me a vagina. 
[00:39:00]  Ah.  But the fact that I was born with this unsightly thing.  Ah.  Ah.  All into this childhood.  He's just, actually, he sounds like Roland.  Yeah, he sounds a little like Roland.  I know I am.  He sounds like, Friday, why?  He sounds like, uh, if Roland and Sam had a kid.  Yeah.  There's a little of, uh, both of them in there.  God, he's just an uber nerd, man.  He's got no social skills.  None whatsoever.  He could not carry on a conversation with, uh, this woman, uh, interviewing him or, or anything. 
[00:39:30]  Right.  It's interesting, though, that they use colors, like, to, to memorize.  That's kind of, uh.  Yeah, that is weird for spelling.  How the hell you do that?  I don't know.  It's weird how the brain works.  The G is green.  I don't know.  Maybe that's how they do it.  And when you say we, you're speaking about your mother, right?  You're homeschooled.  Yeah.  What is that like?  Do you like, uh, getting homeschooled, or would you rather go to school, just a public school?  She's dying here.  No, I like being homeschooled.  What did your mom say when you finally won?  Well, I don't know what my mom said. 
[00:40:00]  I thought he said, I don't know, my mom's dead.  What?  I thought he said, I don't know, my mom's dead.  No.  But he said, I don't know what my mom said.  Yeah.  Okay.  At first, I thought he was laughing and said, no, my mom's dead.  She's dead.  I don't know what my mom said.  You better ask my mom if you want the answer to that question.  All right.  Let me ask your mom.  It's combative.  You're making this tough for me today, Evan. 
[00:40:30]  See?  Yeah.  She's just like, oh my God, I'm alive and this kid is a zero.  She did all right, though.  I mean, that's a rough one.  It's giving bumbling, one-word answers.  This is CNN, though.  It's not local news.  You can take this from the local news, definitely.  In this next clip, Evan and the report discuss tuna subs.  Well, here's one thing I hope I'm right about.  You like to eat, apparently, a Subway tuna fish sub before every competition. 
[00:41:00]  You didn't get to do that yesterday?  What did you just say?  I said you didn't get to do that yesterday?  No.  Why not?  I'm not sure.  We just...  Well, they had the...  They had a special dinner before the bee.  I got you.  So you didn't get a chance to eat your brain food?  The special dinner before the bee.  Before the bee.  Can you see her losing her patience? 
[00:41:30]  I got it.  She didn't get to eat her brain food.  All right.  Look, kid, couldn't you just say, yes, I ate the same thing?  I ate a sandwich, and it was great, and I eat it because it makes me think better.  Oh, he's all about details, man.  And meanwhile, right there...  That's what Uber nerds are about.  They can't go with the flow.  And the dopey kid right there in that one sentence just blew a huge Subway endorsement.  Right.  Like, Subway sandwiches probably would have been...  This is great.  The kid wins the bees on CNN.  He's talking about eating Subway sandwiches before that. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, no, he didn't.  Okay, forget it.  He doesn't have the street smarts, though.  No.  It's all about details and getting them right.  Getting that...  Spelling that word.  Right, right.  I would say Blimpy uses them now.  He didn't eat a Subway, and he won everything.  Simpy.  Subway.  Food for retards.  Here we go.  This is getting better and better.  Listen to this.  Can I ask you about whether or not you can spell this word that I'm about to give you right now?  Are you ready for it?  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  Scombarday.  It's a noun.  Marine food fishes, like mackerels.  Perhaps some of the things that are in a tuna sub.  Can you spell it for me?  Okay.  Now, she's trying to do it like they do it in the contests, right?  Yeah.  She goes, okay, it's a noun.  Sombarday, or whatever she said.  It's a noun.  Something with the fish in it.  Like, you've got to give them this little bit of information, and the kid can't even play along with that.  Right.  He's got to be combative.  Right.  This dopey woman reporter is just trying to, like, do the piece. 
[00:43:00]  And here, spell a word.  We'll have him.  Okay.  We'll ask him about the Subway sandwich.  Right.  How he prepares.  How he prepares.  His mom is proud.  Yeah, yeah.  And then we'll end it off with him spelling a word.  We'll give him a hard word.  Yeah.  And what do they do with the spelling bee?  You give, what is it, a noun or something?  Okay.  This will be good.  He'll go with this.  This is his forte.  Yeah.  And no, he's got to be combative.  Right.  He's got to be combative because it's not like the bee. 
[00:43:30]  And she probably, like, you know, went for a two-hour lunch going, ah, I got the spelling bee.  Yeah.  That's easy.  Spelling bee, kids, easy.  Easy.  It's an easy one.  But this was ten painful minutes on CNN.  I'll take ten of these, aside from one presidential candidate.  Right.  It's going to be a piece of cake.  It's a breeze.  Don't worry about it.  We'll ask him to spell a word.  Wow.  All right, listen.  So she goes, spell scomber day.  Tuna sub.  Can you spell it for me?  Well, let me make sure I'm saying it right. 
[00:44:00]  Stomber day.  Scomber day.  Scomber day.  Yes.  So it's plural?  Yes.  Scomber day.  It's French?  I don't know that part.  It's the, basically, it's the family of fishes that tuna is a part of.  See, you know, because in the spelling bees, whatever questions these kids ask, the person 
[00:44:30]  that, I don't know, moderates the spelling bee, I don't even know what you're calling, they  have all the answers.  So if you go, origin?  Right.  Well, it's from the Latin, like, oh, okay.  And that stuff is really important in the spelling bee competition.  It goes into how words are spelled.  Is it French, a French word of Latin origin?  Yes.  French word of Latin origin.  Use it in a sentence, please.  You know, they got all these things.  And this woman just figures she's going to pull out this word.  Yeah.  And the kid's going to spell it.  And he's going to spell it real fast. 
[00:45:00]  And they can move on to something like some dumb Paris story or something.  But the reason these kids can spell these words is because they know the format of a  Latin word or a French word.  So they would know how the word ends or begins.  You can't just throw a word out to a kid.  She's like, is it French?  I don't know.  Hey.  Hey, kid.  Come on.  She's ready to have just a crying fit on TV.  Just get me the Paris story and get rid of this kid. 
[00:45:30]  Get rid of this kid.  Well, here he goes.  Evan tries to spell.  Scombra Day?  That's right.  Unless I'm saying it wrong like your last name.  I hope not.  Scombra Day.  You want to just give it a try?  Yeah.  If you're not saying it right, I'll probably not spell it right.  Blaming her.  But I can't spell it without the language.  Is it Latin?  They're telling me it's Latin.  Okay.  S-C-O-M-B-E-R-D-A-E. 
[00:46:00]  You got it right.  There it is.  Yes or no?  B-R-R-R.  Oh, you added an extra E.  I'm sorry.  We have another clip, don't we?  We have another clip when a joke bombs.  When one just misses.  You got it right.  You got it right.  Oh, no, wait.  You left out an E.  She thought she was finally out of this uncomfortable interview. 
[00:46:30]  Here it is.  Yes or no?  Who are.  Oh, you added an extra E.  I'm sorry.  But you know what?  That was pretty darn good.  Oh, but you know what?  It doesn't end there.  He can't walk away with her blaming him.  Right.  It's like, bitch, you have the word in front of you.  Yeah.  How do you not just read it while you're saying it?  Right, right, right.  You got it right.  I don't care.  Get rid of this kid.  All excited.  That's what she was doing.  Yeah, that's right.  Hey, leave.  We have one more clip.  And of course, Evan, he's all about the details. 
[00:47:00]  He ain't going to just sit and walk.  He's not going to take that.  Oh, well.  He's not going to take that from the news editor.  I'm not going to take a good try from you.  Good try?  No.  Did you say scombra day or scombra day?  Scombra day.  Scombra day?  Yes.  You want to try one more time?  Are you saying it's S-C-O-M-B-R-I-D-A-E?  Ding, ding, ding.  That's it.  You got it.  So not only did you win the most important one, the one that gave you the cash, you won  the Little American Morning one as well. 
[00:47:30]  But really, I...  It's because I couldn't hear you.  I thought you were saying scombra day.  I got you.  That's why I did the E.  I needed to pronounce it better.  But you know what?  You're a champ, and congratulations.  Hope you're enjoying the victory lap, Evan.  Oh, Dorney.  I'll get it right from now on.  See you later.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  You just blamed her at every turn.  And she's like, okay, you got it a second try.  Good try.  Yeah.  You got it right.  I'm sorry.  You got it right.  You're not talking to a regular eight-year-old or ten-year-old. 
[00:48:00]  Guy can run circles around you as far as knowledge goes.  All right.  I don't know.  I can't get enough of that kid.  Yeah, he's good phrase.  Right?  All right.  We got to take a quick break.  We got Rich Voss and Bonnie joining the program next.  We got Stalker Patty.  We'll bring her in next.  We got a surprise for her today.  Don't forget, nine o'clock.  We have a very limited amount of tickets going on sale for $10 for the Traveling Virus Show,  which is a week from tomorrow at Jones Beach out there on Long Island. 
[00:48:30]  Brought to you by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  At 9 a.m. this morning, $10 tickets while they last.  They're going to go really, really fast.  So make sure you're ready to dial right at nine o'clock.  Okay?  Rich Voss, your word is at.  At.  Rich Voss.  Are you?  Do you mean, is it the type you wear on your head?  Rich joins the program next.  He's one of the nine comedians you can go see for a lousy $10.  Nice.  Starting at 9 a.m.  Those tickets will go very, very fast.  It's kind of a thank you to the New York fans. 
[00:49:00]  I don't know.  I do.  And now we're setting a precedent.  We got to thank everybody across America eventually with all sorts of things.  Yeah.  We'll figure it all out.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Good morning.  How is everybody today?  Good, buddy.  I said, how is everybody today?  They said fine.  You didn't hear?  Yes.  They did?  Yes.  Okay.  Jimmy, what do we got going on?  We got to push this hard. 
[00:49:30]  Well, we have besides, of course, Rich and Bonnie in studio.  What?  I know it.  They snuck in and they're here.  Hi, guys.  Hi.  Here we go.  Traveling Virus Comics.  I've lost $10 tickets for Jones Beach only.  Your chislers.  Starts at 9 o'clock.  $10 for Jones Beach June 16th.  You know, all the comics you know.  Voss, Stephen Lynch, myself.  Louis C.K.  And on the promo, could they stop pronouncing it Louis?  It's not Louis. 
[00:50:00]  I know.  He's a Mexican.  Did they say Louis C.K.?  Yes, it's Louis.  He is Louis.  We can't get anything right.  I know.  I just gave up trying to get things right.  How about just calling him what he is?  Redheaded dope.  A dirty Mexican.  He is.  His words, not mine.  He's right.  He calls himself a dirty Mexican.  Otto and George.  Yeah.  And $10 tickets.  Here's the bad news, though.  $10 tickets.  I just got an email from Pete.  We're only putting 25 tickets on sale at 9 a.m.  That's right. 
[00:50:30]  An odd number.  Yes, an odd number.  And they're all in a row.  You have to look at the other cheapskates.  And they're all behind each other.  In one line.  In one line.  Actually, I got another email.  There's only six of them behind the soundboard, and you're facing away.  Right.  $10 tickets.  Go to Ticketmaster, and then shut your faces.  Tickets are too expensive.  We can't give out the number that we're giving for $10.  Yeah.  Wait.  Why can't we?  You better just call it 9.  All right?  They're going to go real fast. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, I think about the phone number we couldn't give out.  Oh, no.  It's Ticketmaster, whatever.  Oh, the number of tickets.  I got you.  The number of tickets.  Because then you're going to call us cheap.  That's right.  9,000.  That's all we have.  Yeah.  It's brought to you by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  Right?  Yes.  Really fast, because we were talking about this before the break.  In the right field, a base hit.  Unbelievable.  Curt Schilling went eight and two-thirds innings without giving up a hit.  The Red Sox ace.  40-year-old Curt Schilling one out away from a no-hitter. 
[00:51:30]  But it's not to be today as Stewart breaks it up in the ninth.  So close.  That's soft.  Where was he?  He'll do it next time.  That's soft.  Yeah.  It's very easy, right?  Where was he?  Was that in Boston?  Or was that cheering?  The cheering didn't sound like it was in Boston.  He was on the mound.  Curt Schilling.  Okay.  He was in Oakland?  Yeah.  Actually, I might have been cheering.  No, that definitely wasn't a home game, man.  I don't think he slept last night. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, you think maybe they would have cheered that he got that far?  Yeah, they'll always cheer.  Yeah, they'll cheer.  That's just...  But you would have heard like a, oh, before that.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  And then the plight.  And then, yeah.  All right.  Come on, let's give him a hand now.  You did it.  That sucks, though.  No one remembers one-hitters.  No, you're right.  They don't know.  They really don't.  Last time I was in, there was a guy.  Who was the singer, the boss at Fenway Park that messed up the words he was singing at  Fenway Park?  You had a tape on him?  Oh, uh, uh, uh, uh. 
[00:52:30]  Bolton had to look at his hand.  Michael Bolton, yeah.  Michael Bolton had to read his hand.  Yeah.  I felt...  Because I heard he was singing there to audition to sing at Yankee Stadium.  Um, here's my problem with that.  Okay.  Is that you didn't know who it was?  Who's the guy?  It's too much set up.  Well, because that's why I wanted to make it look like it was ad-libbed.  Oh, God.  Because when I go, who's the guy?  Oh, God!  No!  No!  Oh, my.  I'd tell you something.  How did that not go in? 
[00:53:00]  I'll tell you, it was funny watching Rich, because his hand was propped up on the couch  in confident form.  Oh, he was so confident with that one.  And yet there was no confidence with it.  No.  You got it right!  There it is!  Yes or no?  Oh, you added an extra E.  I'd say we get to use it already.  Thank you, Rich.  We were chomping at the bit to use our new one.  That's a good line.  If, like, the story got read, Michael Bolton, and you just fired that out. 
[00:53:30]  But it's like, he woke up knowing that's how he was going to start his appearance on  the Opie and Anthony show.  No, I'm listening.  You woke up going, I got a doozy.  Because you sat back all relaxed.  You looked at Bonnie like, hey, watch this.  I'll handle this one, baby.  I'll handle this.  We'll get this going on the right way.  Just sit back and enjoy.  Right.  Here's the thing.  When that story was being read, the last time I was in the studio, I was working in Providence.  And the line hit me right there.  But I go, I can't do this this close to Boston. 
[00:54:00]  Because if I do it, then the line always stuck in my head.  Don't worry.  That would universally bomb.  That would bomb in Taiwan.  It doesn't matter where you say it.  What did you think?  That people were going to go, we're not going to see his performance because he made a joke  about Yankee Stadium.  What's the matter with you?  I don't know.  I've never heard a wormier thing said by anybody about anything.  I've heard pedophiles have more dignity than trying to explain away their actions. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, yeah.  So you listen to a recording of yourself.  Steven S. from Bayshore is now calling you...  Why'd you say that now?  You should have come back in six weeks and said, remember when Norton said that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, because we didn't even remember what you were referring to.  You think we remember this crap after we do it?  We're on to the next show.  Steven from Bayshore is calling you Rich Screeching Halt Voss.  When Voss's play comes in, he goes, speaking of baseball, you hear that funny home run call  the other day?  The Giants win the pennant.  The Giants win the pennant. 
[00:55:00]  That's when he hears the topic and then he goes through his Rolodex and I have a joke  anywhere near this area.  I have a joke for that.  How about that Mickey Mantle?  Luckiest man?  How could he feel lucky?  He died of Lou Gehrig's disease.  What a coincidence.  And the baby's, you know, what are we, five, six weeks out?  You were telling me before the show, Bonnie?  Yeah, six and a half.  Six and a half.  She fainted last week in the post office.  Yeah?  What?  Did you finally tell her how much you made? 
[00:55:30]  I finally all just, you know, meshed that it was going to be Rich's baby.  I'm Mrs. Rich Voss.  I thought she fainted because she saw the real father in line at the post office and  went, oh, awkward.  Better do something here.  I was outside in the car.  Yeah.  I sent her in, you know.  Why would you send?  You're pregnant.  It's been like 100 degrees in New York.  We're driving around in our convertible.  Okay. 
[00:56:00]  And doing errands and I went into the post office and I said to the lady behind the counter,  I said, oh my God, I think I'm going to faint.  And I just all of a sudden felt really sweet.  Yeah, I did.  But I guess I have low blood pressure and going from hot to cold.  My body has a hard time.  God, you women with those aliens inside of you.  And I am.  With those aliens.  I know.  It like screws you up.  You don't have to guess you have low blood pressure.  That's what they told you.  But here's the thing.  Oh, but I mean, I guess that's why I.  Well, I was sitting in the car. 
[00:56:30]  I was sitting in the car and some lady comes out and says, I think your wife fainted, right?  So I go inside.  I run in and I just see these legs laying behind a table or a counter with her sweatpants on, right?  And I look at her.  So he deduced that it was me.  Very good.  So I looked.  I go around the counter.  She's laying in a puddle of blood like her head was split.  As she fainted, she hit the corner of the table.  Jesus Christ. 
[00:57:00]  Who are you, William Holden?  So I'm telling you, I walk in and she's laying in a puddle of blood, right?  And I'm thinking, ah, I really have to be nice to her, right?  No, I know what you're thinking.  It's like it's scared.  What?  You were thinking, ah, I got a tea time at 1230.  This is going to ruin everything.  No, listen, we had actually, we had meetings that day.  But, you know, you sit there and then the ambulance came and stuff.  So what?  He was freaking out and I could hear him freaking out.  And I could hear people going to him, relax, you're going to freak her out and stuff. 
[00:57:30]  And I wanted to say, but I couldn't really get it together to say, that's just him.  Don't worry about it.  You couldn't drive her yourself?  What?  What's that?  You couldn't drive her yourself?  What?  She had.  The ambulance.  I don't know.  She was laying in a puddle of blood.  I just want to hear him say ambulance again.  Ambulance.  Ambulance.  All right.  First of all, we just sold our car.  I'm not going to put her in the car with blood all over the place.  The guy's going to renege on the deal.  There you go.  There's the rich we know.  Put her in the trunk like Billy Bats and then hose it out in your driveway. 
[00:58:00]  It's just us as squirrel.  So was Rich handling this well?  No.  No.  The first thing he said when he came in was, why is there so much blood?  And I heard some lady go, you're going to freak her out.  And then he was like, where's the ambulance?  Why isn't the ambulance here?  And they kept saying, what, sir?  And he goes, the ambulance.  The ambulance.  And they're like, how old are you, sir?  Are you her son?  I got to go to the library.  We had just had some biscotti.  Oh.  Okay. 
[00:58:30]  I was with my girlfriend in Morton's the other night.  And the maitre d' was a fan of the show.  And he's like, I got to come over and say the funniest moment that he was a long time  ago when Voss was on.  And he was talking about it.  And he goes, and she had a, is it called a hysterectomile?  I didn't say that.  Yes, you did.  Why would you doubt that you said that?  Don't make us go find the audio now.  Hysterectomile.  We got 12 years of audio to go through, but we'll find it.  That was what the guy said. 
[00:59:00]  I've never laughed when people quote, my response was like, no, stupid.  So I never laughed at like exchange things.  I howled all night at that.  Hysterectomile.  And then I remember, I was making a list of Voss flubs.  And then we got kicked off the air.  And I think, I forget how many, I know I had lean cuisine.  Lean cuisine.  And there was another one.  Tortillias.  Tortillias.  You pronounce the silent L.  Yeah.  We were watching Almost Famous.  And we're in the hotel room.  And the guy, you know, he's the, the, the. 
[00:59:30]  Do you mean the movie or the home thing you did?  Almost Famous is kind of a compliment, Rich.  So, so the guy, the, the rock series, you know, when he was really high and he's talking  in the, in the kitchen of that house party and he's going, this machine, I can't remember  the exact line, but he's saying like, this machinery, you know, he's talking about life,  the machinery of life, you know, and Rich goes, look, that's what they used to talk  about before computers.  Oh God. 
[01:00:00]  What an idiot.  And he was so like, disdainful of them.  Oh.  Like what kind of machine do you think that he could have been talking about?  You know, we, we weren't sure if we had time to do this today, but we want to play,  are you smarter than Rich Voss?  We want to play it.  Can we get, we're wondering if Seth is listening today.  Our little, our little, our little fellow, our little friend, we want to play, are you  smarter than Rich Voss?  But the key is we want like, uh, I don't know, 10 to 12 year olds, kind of like the fifth 
[01:00:30]  graders out there for some other time.  We don't have to do it right now.  No.  Yeah.  Look at you.  Look, you're panicking.  He wants to study.  And when I got to the hospital, she was laying.  Remember?  Oh yeah.  Well, I was in the ambulance, I couldn't get them to check the, the baby's heart rate.  So I started freaking out a little bit.  They didn't have the, the heartbeat monitor for the, they couldn't listen or whatever. 
[01:01:00]  So when we got into the hospital, I started crying and I was like, I need somebody to get  a heart rate monitor for the baby.  And so they leave me in the gurney and they go off to get it.  And then Rich comes running in and my, my head is bleeding all over the pillow and I'm  crying and he goes, what's wrong?  What's wrong?  Like, this is how I, I started laughing so hard because it seems so much like now what?  That's what Rich Voss's like great, great, great grandfather said when Lincoln was laying  on that pillow after the, what's wrong?  What's wrong with you? 
[01:01:30]  Did you bang your head?  Yes.  I slipped and hit it on a bullet.  But you're all right now there, Bonnie?  Everything's fine.  Stitches?  Everything's totally fine.  I had five stitches.  Five stitches?  Yeah.  I took them out yesterday.  You feel the baby kicking and stuff, right?  Yeah, the baby kicks a lot, which I actually quite like, but it's the pinching and the  name calling.  I think it's out of line.  And the good thing is we, uh, we mailed the letters.  We got the letters off.  Yeah, good, good, yeah.  Do you feel the baby's kicking?  You like to feel it kicking and stuff?  I, it's, it's creepy.  He doesn't, he doesn't touch me. 
[01:02:00]  It's, you know, some men have like a fetish.  Yeah.  Pregnant women?  Yeah, no, it ain't rich.  Not this one.  Wait, you don't want to have, you don't want to have, uh, sex with Bonnie?  Uh, you know, we're busy.  We're so busy lately.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  You know what he said?  That's what happened the night before she got hurt and then the doctor said, anything  unusual been going on in your life?  I said, well, we didn't have sex last night.  But I, you know, it's just, it's, cause you just don't want anything to do with that  right now?  No, no, no. 
[01:02:30]  Some guys have no problem and they, they go right to the end, man.  Wait, what do you think is going to happen?  Something bad is going to happen?  No, no, no.  No, it's, it's all, it's all visual.  He, he just, he, you know, he's scared that I'm going to get stretch marks.  Like he's, he's obsessed with me putting on a cocoa butter.  It's like, uh, you might get stretch marks.  It's like, it's good that you're at least keeping this in the right spirit.  Yes.  He called me a beast.  Oh, I didn't call her a beast.  That's smart though.  Cocoa butter stops stretch marks. 
[01:03:00]  Oh yeah.  They got all sorts of things.  Somebody, somebody at the hospital, somebody at the hospital commented.  They said that you were rubbing her belly in the hospital and the doctors thought one  of the baby's hands were coming out.  See, cause he got small hands.  Sorry.  It's point, it's point and laugh Friday.  Hey, uh, all right.  Hey, listen, there's boss and Bonnie, uh, joining the show.  Obviously we got stalker Patty over there. 
[01:03:30]  We're going to do something for stalker Patty.  Why?  It get to a microphone, Patty.  We don't have much time.  Come on, Patty.  Get on up there.  There she is.  And by the way, do not go anywhere.  We got the story of the day.  It's wheelchair dude on the, on the front of the, uh, the semi.  What a story.  It's one of the greatest stories ever.  And we have exclusive 911 audio from people that called because they saw this, uh, semi  and this wheelchair guy.  And a great observation from, uh, Anthony this morning in the office. 
[01:04:00]  It's like, you know, people handle like, uh, you know, emergency situations.  Well, we just learned right here, uh, very different, very differently, depending on their  personality.  Yeah.  You got some casual 911 calls about what happened to this kid in his wheelchair.  Just the facts.  And then I'm out there.  And then others just making it about them and just losing their minds, lose their minds.  Yeah.  Stalker Patty, what's going on?  Speaking of law, losing lines, Patty.  Hi.  I see you're due now.  Uh, I, I saw Patty on a pal talk or, uh, was it, was it one of the message boards or 
[01:04:30]  something talking about your hair?  I was, uh, one of the message boards.  It was whack bag.  And, uh, it was a thread about gray hair.  I guess one of the posters was talking that, uh, he had some gray hair coming in and Patty  decided to chime in.  And, uh, Patty, you, um, you, you, you look like you're due for a touch up.  Well, I am going to get the Miss Clairol and have my friend do it again.  She does it for free.  And then it lasts about two months.  The Miss Clairol. 
[01:05:00]  But I'm 52 years old.  That's normal.  For your hair, your hair looks like it's going to blow in front of a saloon before a gunfight.  That's how I feel like it is.  Wow.  Wordy, but good.  Yeah.  Paints a picture, doesn't it?  Yeah.  Well, your, your roots are, uh, probably.  It looks like a mountaintop.  Yeah.  You know, where you can still do some spring skiing.  Oh, it doesn't look that bad in the mirror yet.  It looks bad.  You got a few trails on there I like to attempt.  But everybody my age does.  I just simply color it. 
[01:05:30]  You know.  The world's jump out of trees and try to have sex with your hair.  No.  I don't see anything.  All right, Patty, what did you do for your birthday?  Oh, my friend took me out to lunch from work.  Um, I got a million birthday threads and a million messages on MySpace.  They were all very sweet.  I was so happy.  That's a great present.  I spent two hours just reading them all.  Were you really happy?  Yes, I was.  I was very happy.  I get happy birthday in MySpace messages.  I'm like, all right. 
[01:06:00]  All right, I'm ready.  Oh, no, I'm happy because I don't get very much in the way of cards and stuff.  So it's recognition.  All right, what did you get for your birthday, though?  Like, what kind of gifts did you get?  Oh, I didn't get any gifts, but I never do.  I don't have family, so I don't expect anything like that.  You don't have family?  No.  No, no.  I mean, it's normal to me.  It's been that way for years, you know?  It's Point and Laugh Friday, you know.  Oh, no.  Special day.  Not one person gave you a birthday present. 
[01:06:30]  No, I got taken out for lunch.  That was nice.  And my other friend's going to take me out to dinner.  To where did you go to lunch?  We went to one of my favorite places, Chipotles, which I love.  They get big, huge racks like this, and I love the vegetarian.  I would never attempt to say that word, because I know that's not right.  What's it called?  Chipotles, right?  Chipotles, or I can't pronounce it.  It's an Italian joint, right? 
[01:07:00]  Let's ask for it.  Did you say Chipotles?  Yeah, that's Chipotles.  Is that how you say it?  Oh, okay.  Chipotles.  And it's your favorite restaurant, right?  Chipotles?  Well, not my favorite, but I love the stuff there.  My favorite restaurant of all time will always be Circles Cafe on Bay Ridge Avenue.  No one cares.  No one cares.  Do you like Brugierkine, or how about McDonald's?  I don't eat at those places.  But when she said Chipotles or whatever, Vos goes, oh, I know that joint. 
[01:07:30]  I actually like the upper crusty places like Martone's Steakhouse.  I cannot eat at those places.  This is over my income level.  Income level.  That's too expensive.  Do you know the pronunciation?  Chipotles, right?  Chipotles.  Chipotles.  I want to assault you for that.  This is one of my favorites, though.  Patty, you enjoy Japanese food, like sushi or stuff like that? 
[01:08:00]  I'm afraid of raw fish if I don't eat sushi.  But they do have something.  It is beans, little soy beans.  You know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.  And you pop them in your mouth.  What are those called?  Soy beans?  Oh, my God.  It's like string beans almost, but you pop the little.  Oh, anime.  What is it?  Anime.  E-D-A-M-E.  Anime.  Yeah, Japanese animation.  It's great.  It's Padme.  It's a character from Steel Wars. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Anime?  It's Ed-A-M-E.  I like the Ed-A-M-E.  I thought you called it Ed-A-M-A-M.  No, Ed-A-M-E.  Ed-A-M-E.  Ed-A-M-E.  Yeah.  Everyone knows what you're talking about.  Yeah, somebody pronounced it one time.  I heard some idiot go Ed-A-M-A-M-E.  Yeah, yeah.  It's Ed-A-M-E.  See, I eat mostly vegetables and seafood.  Carats.  Little or no meat.  I like carats.  Turkey.  And cucumbers.  You like shrimp?  I don't like junk food.  I don't like that stuff.  No one cares. 
[01:09:00]  No one cares.  Let's say hi to Nick on Long Island.  Nick, what's going on?  What's up?  Me and my partner every day from work are waiting.  Every day we're waiting for someone to give a Jim Gillette rock scream.  And I would love to hear her say it.  Or give us a good one.  Oh, well, Patti's a very good singer.  You might have heard her sing White Rabbit.  Yeah, I was asked to sing at Dave's wedding.  Of course you are.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you be asked?  That's very nice.  That's an honor.  Are you going to do it?  To sing at a wedding?  Yeah, it's an honor. 
[01:09:30]  What song?  I don't know if I'm supposed to say anything.  I'm going to sing Ave Maria.  Yeah, that's it.  Yeah, is it?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Is it right?  No.  Yeah.  Oh.  I'm not allowed to talk.  I want to take Patty to Morton's for dinner.  Do you?  What?  I want to take you to Morton's.  Why?  I'm not going to.  I'm just saying I would like to.  Oh, okay.  Theoretically.  I've never been to an expensive restaurant.  I know that, but it's really fancy and really good. 
[01:10:00]  You've never been to an expensive restaurant, huh?  It's the best place you've ever been to.  People don't understand the joke.  I say birthday as it.  Don't bother.  Like you're making fun of Voss and you said birthday.  Don't bother.  Someday the listeners will actually understand the show we do.  Hey, you want to do a rock scream for us, Patty?  Because you do sing.  A rock scream?  You know what the rock screams are?  I'll give you an example.  Get your headphones on.  Whoa.  Oh, boy.  She's almost dropping them. 
[01:10:30]  Because then we have to take a break and then we've got to give you your surprise.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  She can't figure out the headphones.  Oh, they're slipping all over her head.  All right.  Here you go.  Okay.  This is a rock scream.  Okay.  All right.  We want you to imitate that, okay?  Very easy.  Eee.  Yeah.  Very melodic. 
[01:11:00]  Best one yet.  All right.  Let's see.  Wait.  Well, you didn't tell Anthony what the fanciest place you have ever had?  Yeah.  Fanciest restaurant you've ever been to.  Yeah.  I've never been to any.  Maybe Red Lobster.  Do you like steak or no?  Oh, no.  Wait a minute.  Bubba Gump is better than Red Lobster.  Ah, you went to Bubba Gump Shrimp there in Times Square?  Yeah.  I've eaten there four times.  Well, that is fancy.  Four times.  Wow.  You must have had a lot of different shrimp.  Yeah.  What did you have there?  What kind of shrimp did you have there? 
[01:11:30]  My favorite is the shrimp that comes in a basket with the corn on the cob.  It's really good.  It's called shrimp in a basket.  Exactly.  The side of corn on the cob.  Do you like steak?  I eat it, but I can't have that much of it, though.  Why?  I can't have food.  It's too heavy.  Well, number one, it's too heavy, and it's a lot of fat and stuff.  Not filet mignon.  That's a nice lean cut.  I think I had that once, one time and one time only. 
[01:12:00]  Did you like it?  Yeah.  I remember enjoying it, and it came with a lot of spinach, my favorite vegetable.  Oh, wow.  By the way, we're not taking advantage of the retarded.  There's new listeners checking in.  They're going to contact the authorities.  Hey, I took an IQ test online, and I scored 132, so I'm happy.  No possible way.  Yes, I did.  That you can get online.  No, she's kind of like the spilling bee kid.  Her social skills stink, but she actually is very intelligent in other ways. 
[01:12:30]  Because I got 141 online.  Stop.  Those are three scores in a row.  Just listen.  My IQ is wonderful.  You left out the decimal point.  Your IQ is not 141.  It's 141.  No, it's not.  It is not.  I guarantee it's 141.  Listen to me.  Oh, my God.  Listen.  Okay, I got the printout.  If you meet me at the Stress Factory this weekend, I'll show you the printout I have.  Wait.  You're playing the Stress Factory where?  In New Brunswick, Friday and Saturday.  There you go.  Rich Voss.  But I'm 141.  My IQ. 
[01:13:00]  732-545-4242.  He would say, hey, hey.  732-545-4242.  Who are you with?  Bonnie, you working or no?  Yeah.  Okay, she's Bonnie.  Rich, who else?  Hey, that's cool.  Maybe you'll have the baby on stage, man.  Now that would be a treat.  Give people their honey's worth, man.  Yeah.  Hey, Patty.  Can we just move on with Patty?  She's really annoying me.  Yeah.  Why?  We'll just get into the reason she's here.  We're going to get you a birthday gift.  Yes.  So just leave.  Danny, go. 
[01:13:30]  Danny, well, we're not going to say where.  No.  Danny's going to call from his cell phone.  You two are going to leave, hit the streets of New York, and I decided to give you a little  shopping spree.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yep.  I need summer things.  Yes, you do.  I have no money for it.  I know.  Patty, you never have money, so we figured, you know, there are things you need.  We'll get you a little shopping spree.  Yeah, so Danny's going to, like, call from the store we chose for you.  Okay?  I'm going to throw something in for your summer shopping spree. 
[01:14:00]  Ooh, a whole $5.  You're going to be peeling off those bills.  Oh, wow.  I'm going to give Patty $50.  Wow.  Patty, look at that.  You just got two and a half t-shirts.  That's right.  That's great.  $50 for Patty.  Yeah, let me hand.  You hand Patty that $50.  Of course, I got to take my take.  You take your take.  There's a little skim going.  That's the way it happens on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:14:30]  So $40 to you, $10 to me.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Fair enough.  All right, Danny, why don't you hit the street with Patty, and we'll check in with them next,  okay?  Happy birthday.  But you have to spend the money at the store we choose.  That's all.  Okay.  All right, because it's a sponsor and stuff, you know.  Okay.  All right, we got to take a break.  We got Billy Connolly stopping in in a little while.  Also, Carl Schmitz, you're checking in.  Ticket special.  We're only an hour and a half out there, Jimmy. 
[01:15:00]  That's right.  $10 tickets.  That means Patty can buy five of them.  Yeah.  Yeah, Patty.  I'm choking my own spit.  $10.  Go to Ticketmaster's for Jones Beach only.  A week from tomorrow.  Yes.  Nine comedians for $10.  And let's just say it's not a large amount of tickets, and it's embarrassing to admit how many  are actually going on sale for $10.  It sounds cooler than it really is.  It makes us sound like superstars, but the reality is you better get to a phone right  at 9 o'clock and hope for the best.  Call quickly.  To get the $10 tickets.  Three $10 tickets.  All right, Patty. 
[01:15:30]  Go.  Go.  Go shop.  There she goes.  When we get back, story of the day, wheelchair dude.  Yeah, I love it.  This is funny on so many levels.  Thank God he wasn't hurt.  Trust me, don't go anywhere, and don't go to another station.  They're not going to do a good job with this story.  I guarantee you.  Patty's rump is looking pretty good, actually.  You always loved her rump.  I didn't love it.  I mean, let's slow down a little.  I'm just looking maybe.  You've commented about her ass many times over the years.  It's the only redeeming quality she has as a person.  Do you realize if her ass wasn't good, I wouldn't acknowledge she was a living thing. 
[01:16:00]  I'd look at her the same way I'd look at a tree root.  When you gave her that $50, did you feel weird that you weren't handing it through your car window?  Yeah, it was kind of odd that I wasn't like, you fooled me.  I thought you were a chick.  All right.  Go ahead.  We're running late, but story of the day next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock.  Yeah, it's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:16:30]  I'm the Instant Feedback.  We got Laura from Philly listening on WYSP.  Laura writes, I hope you guys are not jerking Patty's chain.  Patty worships you guys, and a shopping spree to her is like a five-star, two-week trip through Europe for the rest of us.  And if you're going to embarrass her again, again in capital letters, you guys suck.  Laura, keep listening.  Rich Voss and Bonnie in studio. 
[01:17:00]  We've gotten from Oswald, and we also have coming up shortly the great Billy Connolly.  Yeah, he's here.  We've got to get him on immediately.  Just so we know, Voss is, Oswald is keeping score.  Greg Guineer, Bangladesh, Worcester, as in like Worst?  No, no, I think that was Worcester Mass.  Oh, Worcester Mass.  He called it Worcester.  Worcester.  A very amusing mispronunciation of Nicorette gum. 
[01:17:30]  Lean Cazine.  Multiple Sclerosis.  Sclerosis.  I don't remember these.  Multiple Sclerosis.  I don't remember these.  He says.  Tortillias.  Oh, that one.  And one of my favorite, Matty Graw.  Matty Graw.  Oh, oh, Sherlock Holmes.  Sherlock Holmes was another one.  Sherlock Holmes.  Well, Patrice was in that day, and we must have gotten you to say that guy's house, and 
[01:18:00]  he said, Sherlock Holmes.  Sherlock Holmes.  Like, we were all, I've never been happier to hear anything in my life.  I was only talking about one of them.  Hey, we should get Billy Connolly in for this next story.  Yes.  The story of the day, definitely.  Yeah.  God, he did our show, I don't know.  A while ago, next time he was very, very young.  Way too long ago, and then I think we got a phoner from him.  We love this guy.  Billy Connolly is hilarious.  And he fits in perfectly with this radio show.  Yes.  And he had that observation about how we just beat up our listeners, and he thinks it's 
[01:18:30]  brilliant.  Did you know we're on XM?  We're on XM right now, so we can't curse.  Yeah.  Well, you know, it would be good if in the green room, maybe somebody-  Billy!  Hey, Billy.  There he is.  Hey, Billy.  The gathering of the work shy.  How are you?  Good, good.  Come on, sit down.  Billy, take a seat.  We figured we'd get you in, because we're about to do the story of the morning, and  I'm sure-  Please, I see you all in the news.  What?  I saw you all in the news. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that was us accepting the Nobel Peace Prize, I believe.  Yeah, wasn't it?  Yeah.  The chain gang.  It was that one.  It's like you were phoning somebody.  You're always preoccupied.  Nothing beats the phony phone call.  That was a phony phone call.  When you don't want to draw attention to it.  If you ever don't want to draw attention to yourself, in any situation, regardless if  it's news cameras or just at a party or something, you take out your cell phone and just start 
[01:19:30]  blathering into it.  That's a wonderful thing.  It's great.  Because people won't talk to you when you're on the cell phone.  No, it's funny.  I took a phone call, and Anne took a phone call while they were filming us.  I did mine first.  And I didn't know that you did it first, and then I said, hey, you know, I took a fake  phone call there.  He goes, dude, I did the same thing.  We should have just called each other and just started chatting about our walk.  An old actor told me once on the set, he said, if you don't want anybody to talk to 
[01:20:00]  you, if you're looking at your script or something, you don't want people to bother you,  put your tongue out.  Really?  Yeah, if you're reading your script, you stick your tongue out.  People don't approach you.  When your tongue is sticking out.  Yeah, your tongue is a sort of barrier.  It must be something like I'm really concentrating, or it's just...  Yeah, it must send some weird signal.  Or it's intrusive that now that tongue that's just kind of relaxing and hanging out is going  to have to be used if I come over and he's talking.  Yeah, it's like a kind of fleshy warning.  Yeah, yeah, a fleshy warning.  Isn't it? 
[01:20:30]  You know what I do when I go to the gym now?  I wear the iPods, you know, the buds or whatever, and it's attached to nothing.  The other end is just in my pocket.  I swear to God.  No one bothers you, though, man.  Oh, that's excellent.  That's a good one.  On days I don't feel like listening to music, I still put the buds in my ears and it's just  dangling in my pocket, attached to nothing.  The last time I was home in Scotland, I saw a couple in the street, a young guy in his  twenties with his wife, and she was pushing a baby in a chair. 
[01:21:00]  But he had the iPod on.  And I thought, he's walking along with his wife and his kid.  And doesn't even want to talk to them or hear anything they have to say.  I thought that was horrible.  That marriage is doomed to last forever.  Yeah.  I use the phone for a lot of things.  My cell phone, like if I'm walking down the sidewalk here in the city and there's somebody,  I just don't like people behind me when I'm walking.  Like if they're right behind me, if I could see a little out of my peripheral vision, I'm 
[01:21:30]  okay, but right behind me kind of freaks me out a little.  So I'll take my phone out and make like I dialed and start talking and step to the side  and stop.  Because I think, like I could do without the phone, but if I do, then I'm thinking, that  person's going to think that I'm stopping to let them pass me because I don't trust them  behind me.  When the fact is, that's exactly what I'm doing.  But if I pull the phone out, it's like, I'm making a phone call.  Don't worry, just pass me.  I could do this without you feeling that I'm being prejudiced. 
[01:22:00]  You know what I've done on the phone?  I swear to God, I've gotten weird vibes.  I've actually been faked on the phone and said, look, I can see your window.  I know.  Oh, like they're watching you so you don't get attacked?  Yeah.  Oh, is that horrible?  Yeah, I really am a douche.  One day, our phones are all going to just get snatched from us.  We're pulling them out for safety.  That's wonderful.  Hey, nice phone.  All right, we got to do story of the morning.  Yeah, this one.  And it's not Paris Hilton, whatever.  That's what we talked about already.  Yeah, she's a lot of outrage that she's been let out very, very early and now is under house arrest in her mansion. 
[01:22:30]  I wish it was Paris Hilton.  That would have been interesting, a 911 call about how a tractor trailer is leaving a slug trail behind it.  Did you hear about wheelchair kid on the front of a semi?  No.  This is a freak accident that could never happen.  Like, it was a perfect chain of events.  I don't know if they describe how it happened in the story or –  I think the kid was – we got the news story to bring everyone up to speed, but I think he was trying to cross the street. 
[01:23:00]  He was trying to cross the street.  And you know how tractor trailers have to make the wide kind of turns around there?  Yes, yes, yes.  And he couldn't see over the front of his cab and actually bumped into the kid in the wheelchair, but hit it directly in the back of the wheelchair and then got around the turn and cranked up to 50 miles an hour.  The kid is sitting in the wheelchair on the front grill of this semi doing 50 miles an hour.  Did you hear the update with that, though? 
[01:23:30]  It turns out that the truck was off and the kid was just wheeling and was very strong.  What a strong kid.  How far did he go?  Five miles.  About five miles.  Actually, he made it to the toll booth and they wanted him to pay extra for the extra axle.  And that's when he knew that something was amiss.  I saw the story and I saw the kid.  Yeah.  And I'm thinking it's going to turn out to be the greatest day of his life.  A lot of people are like, can't believe it happened.  But I think in the kid's eyes, he's like, this is the coolest thing that will ever happen to me. 
[01:24:00]  He's an angel to know that.  Yeah, he wasn't even injured.  And the chair is fine.  Yeah.  And he just like flew 50 miles an hour down the highway just in his wheelchair.  You know what a rush that would be like?  Can you imagine?  He had dead bugs all over his throat.  His teeth.  Seven inches of dead bugs.  Oh, God.  Well, here's the story to bring everyone up to speed.  And then what we got, which is...  Up to speed.  Good one.  Yeah, there you go.  And what we got, which is different than anyone else talking about, we got the 911 call. 
[01:24:30]  911 calls.  This is hilarious.  You'll notice the 911 calls.  Some people are cut out to handle catastrophes on 911.  They know how to get the facts out, very calm, cool, collected.  And other people lose their minds.  Oh, you mean people actually at the accident.  Yeah, they were standing on the side of the road, saw the tractor-trail, and they're sitting  there going like, oh, my God, there's a wheelchair on the front of us with some kid flailing 
[01:25:00]  his arms.  Who's going to believe you?  Exactly.  I would think it was like a movie stunt or something.  I wouldn't give a second thought.  I'd be like, ah.  Especially New York.  Like, there's no way that just happened.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was thinking it was a hood ornament or something.  A hood ornament.  All right, here's the news story.  It's quick.  A Michigan man in a wheelchair got the fright of his life when a semi-truck took him on  a wild ride.  Ben Carpenter was crossing the street when the handlebars of his wheelchair got stuck 
[01:25:30]  in the truck's grill.  The truck driver then pulled out without realizing he had an unwilling passenger, and he headed  down a highway at 50 miles an hour.  Oh, that's brilliant.  The parking driver caught 911, and four miles later, a cop stopped the truck.  Four miles?  He went four miles.  That's far, man.  That's a long, long way.  Do you know how long that is for him sitting there?  It must have been like, this has to be an hour.  This has to be an hour that went by.  The trucker, like, probably a lot of people are beeping at him and stuff.  He's like, oh, why is everyone beeping at me?  What is your problem? 
[01:26:00]  He's just like, ah.  Yeah, you too.  I know how this goes.  Yeah, right back at you.  Hey, you bunch of asses.  All right, I'll let him by.  Go ahead.  Go around me, idiot.  And the cop pulled him over, and he's like, get off the chair.  Come out with your hands up.  Here's the rest of the story.  A cop stopped the truck. 
[01:26:30]  Well, that was pretty scary.  It was, well, I was saying help, yeah.  I was saying help.  Amazingly, Ben was not hurt, and his wheelchair survived the entire ride without any damage.  I love his voice.  Help.  I was saying help.  You were inhaling help.  No, yeah.  50 miles an hour.  And no one heard him over.  Help. 
[01:27:00]  Help.  Help.  Help.  People were going, hey, he's already in a wheelchair.  What's the big deal?  Oh, God.  It's going to try to correct his spine.  I know.  You think this song went through his head?  A little Jerry Reed from Smokey and the Bandit.  Now, we've got to get this cripple from Texarkana to Georgia. 
[01:27:30]  That's right.  And, of course, a Jackie Gleason song pass by.  That's an attention getter.  It certainly is.  What we're dealing with here is a complete lack of respect for the Lord.  Yeah.  Yeah, baby.  Oh, my God. 
[01:28:00]  You've got to see the video, though.  I mean, when you see this kid, you're going to realize this will be the greatest day of his life.  Yeah.  It will be the greatest day of my life.  Hey, break your break, your old turnip leg grill.  Break your break.  Break your break.  Break your break.  Break your break.  Break your break.  Break your break.  Break your break.  You had to see the smoke coming from his hand and the wheels.  I still love the bizarre hood ornament.  Rich Voss.  Yeah, that's Rich Voss. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, God.  He's playing Stress Factory this weekend.  Tonight and tomorrow.  New Brunswick.  Oh, my God.  Well, this is only the first part of the story.  So then the 911 calls come in.  We should probably take a break or we're going to rush through this.  Yeah, we've got to get the 911 calls.  Yeah, because they're just terrific.  They really are.  And then we'll check in with Danny and Sam.  They're out there with Patty.  Stargirl Patty.  Yeah.  She's having a birthday shopping spree today.  On us.  I forgot to give my money, though.  What are the odds?  Does she have enough money? 
[01:29:00]  I've gotten better, Rich.  She's got 50 bucks.  Yeah, but that was just...  By the way, did you make the egg salad sandwiches?  No.  You made them?  Yeah, why not?  I make...  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We were...  Billy, we were playing golf recently, and Rich packed me a nice little lunch to have after  nine holes.  An egg salad sandwich.  Well, I'm not going to bring my own sandwich and not bring you a sandwich.  Rich is cheap.  Am I cheap?  You're cheap.  No, he's not.  That's cheap.  You've got to go in and get something at the clubhouse. 
[01:29:30]  I did.  I insulted him, because I'm like, I don't like egg salad.  It's 95 degrees out, so I got a nice grilled chicken sandwich, and he was insulted.  What are you, was it a grandmother?  I was like his date or something, man.  Oh, that's why...  Because I did...  I ate it, and I was like, why was there an extra egg salad?  I don't know.  Oh, you ate it after it sat in a golf bag in the heat for...  And then I fainted later that day.  Yeah, no wonder you fainted.  Yeah, but he had little trail mix snacks and little napkin for each sandwich. 
[01:30:00]  He has a little cooler.  A little drinky.  I think it was like a sippy cup drink for us.  First of all...  A little checkerboard sheet so you could set up a picnic.  I brought a basket.  I'm cheap.  It was very thoughtful.  I did return...  Tell him about the...  All right, we've got to take a break.  You guys are organizing.  Which goes into a story.  All right, we'll take a break.  And Billy Connolly, what are we promoting today?  A zombie movie.  Yeah?  Yeah, my new zombie movie comes out on the 15th. 
[01:30:30]  It's called Fido.  Fido?  Yeah, that's my name in it.  I'm like a boy's dog.  I'm his pet.  The family pet is a zombie.  All right, we're going to talk about that a little more.  I'm reading a little snaps.  It looks good.  It's very interesting.  It was...  We had a screening the other night and it was brilliant.  Really?  It went down a storm.  Yeah, it's a very...  It's a comedy with zombies in it.  It's not a zombie movie, you know.  You can't go wrong with zombies.  That's what I always say.  People love zombies, man.  There's a whole zombie culture.  Yeah.  I didn't know about it until I had to do the interview.  Zombie magazines. 
[01:31:00]  People love zombies.  Yeah, and they show up like zombies at the movie with the big holes in the head and all  that.  I don't want any fans.  Just our fans.  They just want to say hi.  All right, we got so much going on.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll regroup.  And don't forget these $10 tickets for the Jones Beach Show, which is a week from tomorrow.  Eight or nine comedians for $10.  It's a special.  We don't have many, but they go on sale at 9 a.m. through Ticketmaster.  That's true.  And it's brought to you by Bud Light. 
[01:31:30]  Always worth it.  It's Opie and Anthony.  A real busy morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Rich Voss and Bonnie in studio.  They're playing the Stress Factory, New Brunswick, New Jersey, tonight and tomorrow night.  And we're talking to Billy off air about...  Billy is promoting on Fido, where he plays the zombie, which comes out June 15th on limited  release.  And we're talking about The Sopranos.  And I thought Rich was kidding.  Billy's like, I don't want this show to end because it looks good.  And Voss is like, well, I'm like, you have to watch it the night it happens because you'll 
[01:32:00]  know the next day.  And Voss goes, no, not me.  I'm waiting until it comes out on DVD.  He did...  What?  What are you talking...  Everyone...  Are you kidding?  Wait, first of all, we buy every season on DVD.  Fine, but you're going to know what happens.  How do you not even watch it?  It's going to be on the front page of the New York Papers.  I'm not going to...  So...  Oh, reading the newspaper.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot who you're talking to.  You're right.  Rich Voss.  You're right.  If they started writing reviews on the stalls in Men's Room by the whole...  Right at eye level.  I don't know exactly what it is. 
[01:32:30]  It'll even be on the rest area wall, so you better avoid those rest areas for the next  six months.  You know, Sharipa used to book comedy.  The guy...  He got shot.  He's dead.  I know him.  Bobby Bacala's dead.  Oh, Jesus.  You ruined it for me.  How do you not know?  Bobby Bacala got shot.  He was holding a train.  They killed him.  And Christopher's dead, too, because Tony held his nose.  Tony killed Christopher.  I knew that one.  You knew that one.  You knew that one?  Look how bummed out you are.  How do you avoid this stuff?  Yeah.  It's disappointing.  The mother dies, too, after season two. 
[01:33:00]  I've seen it.  Nice language.  She's the greatest character ever.  But she died in real life before she died on the show, so then they had some kind of animated  superimposed head down there.  It was creepy.  Any of it's better.  We get 24 on DVD.  Okay.  You could watch three or four a night.  Who's going to watch 24 and wait until the next week?  Rich, we understand that.  But what you're doing wrong is we all have box sets that we're watching right now in the  studio, but we don't tell each other.  You don't say it on the air.  You don't say which box set you're watching because then, of course, it's our job to blow 
[01:33:30]  up your spot.  I went through three seasons of Lost in about a week and a half, and I never mentioned it  on the air because I know scrolling on the website would be every spoiler because people  just love wrecking it.  They love wrecking it.  They love it.  I love doing it.  Yeah.  We all do it.  I know.  We all do it.  I know.  You're kidding.  We all do it.  When the Harry Potter book was coming out, we went down to the line that people were standing  in at the bookstore with a bullhorn and just yelled out all the spoilers, the big 
[01:34:00]  surprise person that died in that book, and we're just yelling out, and these little  geeks and nerds are going, you bunch of, you know, a-holes, they're calling it.  It was just the worst.  I love it.  Oh, you got the clip?  Oh, hold on.  Yeah, go ahead.  With dorks yelling at us.  Snape kills Dumbledore.  Snape kills Dumbledore. 
[01:34:30]  Hey, Snape kills Dumbledore.  Hey, you were the glasses.  You bitch.  You bitch.  Little kids are yelling, you bitch.  Our greatest one ever, though, is the Star Wars.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Which movie was it?  Damn, the first one of the remakes.  Oh, the first one that came back?  Yeah.  So we sent our guys in a van down to the Star Wars line.  You know, they hang out for days and they're all dressed in the costumes like you were saying 
[01:35:00]  with the zombies, and it was Earl, and it was Ben and Earl.  Was it Ben and Earl?  Yeah.  And stupid Earl, though, he parks the van in such a way that he can't get out quickly.  He, like, parallel parked it with an inch between each bumper.  Or, like, he allowed someone else to double park a man.  It's key to the story.  So then they get out and they get on the bullhorn and do pretty much the same bit, giving away  the whole movie.  And these people have been online for, like, a month or whatever, two weeks.  They lost their minds to the point. 
[01:35:30]  And they did this, which was stupid.  They gave out, like, radio station pens before they decided to.  Yeah, they gave out, like, swag and stuff from the station to, like, lull them into a  false sense of security.  Yeah, we're like, hey, we're here.  You guys have been here for weeks.  We want to give you some stuff from the radio station.  So we hand out all this stuff.  And it's like all sorts of weapons.  Yes, Senator Palpatine is the emperor, the evil emperor.  And it's just, you mother of a...  They're yelling, and they just started heaving all of the stuff that was just given out  at the van. 
[01:36:00]  All the pens.  Yeah.  They were being pelted with pens.  So our guys jump back in the van, but they can't get out.  To make their escape.  But they're blocked in, so now they have to deal with it.  And all you hear is, like, pens and stuff hitting the side of the van.  Then they started pounding on the van and rocking it.  Thank God they were Star Wars geeks.  So they couldn't...  They didn't have any real power.  Yeah, yeah.  It's wonderful being a spoiler, though.  All right.  It's a wonderful piece.  It really is.  I don't know why, but it is.  A friend of mine was in jail, and he said the worst thing about jail was all of the mystery 
[01:36:30]  novels in the library, the names were underlined.  Like, you know, you're at the sixth page, and you notice this name is underlined all the  time.  The guy who did it, you know.  I can't remember that one.  He just goes for a record for you.  He's got nothing else to do but underline his name.  It's right through the whole book.  It's just some name that's, like, on page three that you don't even bother to even concentrate  on.  Oh, is that a great gag?  It doesn't figure in the story yet, but there's a highlight that's going on here. 
[01:37:00]  You're just smart enough to know, oh, man.  I guess it beats getting raped in the shower.  My book got ruined.  It could be worse.  I'm in prison.  But that's worse if one happens right after the other.  At least while I'm healing in the hospital, I can read this Agatha Christie.  Oh, it drives you to the shower.  You're so depressed.  Yeah.  Like, I'm going to the shower.  I'm going to take a shower.  I'm going to get raped.  Oh, not this.  And Billy Connolly was saying he's going through withdrawals as far as The Sopranos go, even 
[01:37:30]  though the final episode hasn't hit yet.  Yeah.  How do you think it's going to end?  I don't know.  I think it looks as if there's going to be a massive wipeout.  You think it's going to be crazy?  Tony, the wife, everybody.  Yeah.  The kids.  A lot of people saying it might be Janice that takes out Tony.  You've got to think they're going to take out Tony.  I'm thinking.  In a surprise way, something you never saw coming?  Nope.  No?  I already know.  Paulie Walnuts will shoot him.  We're being involved with his death.  Yes.  Oh, that's a good idea.  I think so, because he was talking to Brooklyn for a while. 
[01:38:00]  I think it's going to be Paulie Walnuts.  That's to throw us off, bro.  I don't know.  Do you know Paulie?  They're that good at that job.  Oh, there was a meeting about a year ago with the Brooklyn people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where Paulie.  Yeah.  And when they said, should we kill, we're going to kill Tony, Bobby Bacala, and Silvio,  and they said, and Paulie goes, no, not Paulie.  He's just those three.  Brooklyn said, don't kill him.  Because they only wanted the head.  Why wouldn't they want Paulie?  He's a soldier.  Yeah, I know.  That's true.  I think maybe that might be to distract you, but.  When Stevie Van Zandt went, I lost the will to live. 
[01:38:30]  I couldn't believe.  Well, he's not dead yet, but I think he will die.  But yeah, he's just in bad shape.  He satisfies whatever happens.  Janice shows up, and Tony's there to help her through her grief, and then all of a sudden  she turns around and just kills him.  I think this is what's going to happen.  Because Paulie, the character that actually plays him, said when he re-signed, he goes,  I'll re-sign for the show, but I don't want to be a guy that turns or rats or anything  like that.  So he kind of.  He didn't know that.  Yeah, he negotiated that.  He's a real mob guy, though. 
[01:39:00]  Allegedly.  He doesn't want to look like that.  Another thing, and here's what I think is going to happen.  If you notice, they ordered pizza right before the last episode ended.  I think there's a rat in the house that's kind of going to tell people where Tony is  and everything.  And I think Paulie's going to get killed defending Tony.  There's probably going to be a massive gunfight at this house, and I think somehow Tony's going  to get out of it.  I don't know what happens after that, but I don't think Tony's going to die at that house.  Yeah, maybe you're right. 
[01:39:30]  I think Paulie's going to actually sacrifice himself for Tony.  Maybe.  Protecting him.  Okay.  Because I heard he was a real tough guy, Sirico, in real life.  He did jail time.  He was like a bonafide ass kicker.  Yeah, he was a real thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Listen, we're moving real fast today.  With his little wings.  We've got to get the 911 calls with wheelchair dude.  Oh, yeah.  And Tammy's very upset with me because I said it's a kid.  It looks like a kid if you're seeing the video.  How old is the guy?  He looks like a kid.  Thank you, Anthony.  He looks like a fat little kid.  But Tammy's obsessed with accuracy with our radio show.  All right, Tammy. 
[01:40:00]  I thought it was a kid.  I guess it's an adult.  No, he is a kid.  He felt like a kid that day, though.  He sure did.  Thank you, Reg.  The Stress Factory, New Brunswick, tonight and tomorrow.  We've got Stalker Patty on the line.  Stalker Patty.  Hey, how are you?  Say hi to Billy Connolly.  Hi, Billy Connolly.  Hi, Patty.  How are you doing?  She's an actual stalker.  We met her about almost 10 years ago, and she was stalking our program.  We said, I might as well keep her close.  Oh, absolutely.  Always know where your stalker is.  And that's my motto.  I don't know about you.  Yes.  They think it's a made-up character, but she actually stalked the show back in the day 
[01:40:30]  and continues to stalk her.  She's 50 years old.  52.  52 now.  That's right.  Years are going by.  52.  She's a virgin.  She's untouched by man.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  And this is because she grew up in this Catholic, strictly Catholic foster family  after her mother, who was some kind of prostitute.  Hoochie Mama.  Hoochie Mama.  Some kind of Hoochie Mama.  Hoochie Mama hooked up with this Wall Street guy and got pregnant.  And then the Wall Street guy left, and her being what she was, couldn't have a baby, 
[01:41:00]  so she left the baby, Patty, on the counter of a diner.  Yes.  The baby, then left on the counter, ended up in the New York City Foundling Center.  Sounds like something out of our gang comedies.  I just saw it the other day.  The New York Foundling Hospital.  There's still a foundling hospital?  Are you serious?  It's on 18th.  Come on.  18th.  Wow.  Yeah, it's on 18th and 5th. 
[01:41:30]  Well, she was there.  She was there.  She was a foundling.  The New York Foundling Hospital.  Foundling.  Doesn't that sound like something from the 1800s?  I always think of...  It's like Mary Ingalls Blind School.  I've got this picture of...  It's next to the foundling.  I keep getting this picture of the foundling fathers.  The foundling fathers.  These babies have got hats with buckles on and flying outside somebody's door.  Bill of Rights, I want my papa.  She should be stalking more active people.  Yeah, exactly.  If she's a virgin at 52, she's stalking the wrong people.  52. 
[01:42:00]  And it's safe to say that she'll be a virgin until she dies.  Yeah, until she dies.  She grew up in a very strict Catholic foster home.  They tried to, like, pound this religion into her.  And because of that, nothing else gets pounded.  Although I didn't think Catholic foster homes were big in virginity.  Judging by the publicity.  Well, maybe if she was a boy.  Tell them when the blood poured on her head at the prom.  Uh, no.  What?  Carrie reference.  At the road show when we dumped blood on her head. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, I wasn't using that.  I was just saying...  Carrie reference.  Yes.  It's fairly accurate, except Carrie was, like, a high school student, and Patty's just cryptic.  And we did that to her.  We did that in front of 10,000 people.  Yeah.  All right, listen.  Here we go.  Patty, we're sorry.  We're sorry for another day.  We're just asses.  I don't remember everything you do.  All right, listen.  Patty.  Stalker Patty's 52.  Her birthday just passed, right, Patty?  And what did we tell you we were going to do for you today?  Take me on some kind of a shopping spree.  She doesn't have a lot of money, Billy.  No.  You know, and we found out, you know, she's very popular as far as the listeners go. 
[01:43:00]  And none of the listeners gave her a gift.  They gave her, like, happy birthday wishes on her.  On her MySpace.  MySpace.  That was great.  And she gives gifts to us every birthday we have.  So we figured, you know, we'll give her a shopping spree.  Right?  Right.  All right.  Do you know where you're going yet, Patty?  Not yet.  I'm on the corner, but I don't know where we're going.  You're on the corner of where? 
[01:43:30]  33rd and 7th.  33rd and 7th?  Action Avenue.  Isn't that interesting?  What kind of shops are around?  All kinds of shops.  Eateries.  A lot of bookstores.  A lot of clothing.  Oh, good.  Good.  Clothing.  So good.  Books.  You're, like, reading, Patty.  Very good.  And so where do you think Danny's going to take you?  I mean, you're looking around.  You see all these stores.  What's your guess?  Where do you want to go, too?  I don't know. 
[01:44:00]  I can't imagine.  I'm waiting to be surprised.  And you said you need some summer clothes, right?  So you're hoping one of those clothing stores in the area, you're going to walk in and get  to spend your money, right?  I do need.  Yeah.  What, Patty?  You just stepped all over Oak.  What?  Have you ever talked on a phone before?  And now she doesn't talk when she's supposed to talk.  We hate her, Billy.  Yeah.  We hate her.  She's mousy, and we wish her dead.  Just in case you haven't figured it out yet.  We can't stand this one.  All right, Patty, it's talk, listen, talk, listen. 
[01:44:30]  They're not simultaneous.  Now, what were you saying?  Because we didn't hear you because we were listening to Oak.  I'm sorry.  Can you repeat that?  Oh, please, God.  Let a wrecking ball just get her in the chest.  I want the same thing to happen as happened to wheelchair kids without the wheelchair.  They'll call her shoe lady, and when they find her, it'll be up to her kneecaps.  Patty.  Stump blood.  All I said was, you've got a bookstore, you've got clothing stores, you've got eateries. 
[01:45:00]  Where do you think Danny's going to take you, or where are you hoping he's going to take you?  To find her mom.  I don't know.  I guess to a clothing store, right?  Well, a clothing store, because you did say you need summer clothes.  Please tell me there's an office there that says Kevorkian on the front there.  I would like to see her just get rammed by a truck and look like Dorf on golf when she's done.  What do stalkers wear?  Camouflage clothes.  Yeah, city camouflage clothes.  You've got pictures of doorways.  Army surplus store. 
[01:45:30]  She's dressed like something that should have been scooped up after a dog walk.  Danny.  Well, that's terrible.  By the way, happy birthday to you.  It is a great birthday wishes.  Yeah.  All right.  We've got Danny out there with her.  Danny?  Hey, guys.  How are you going to do?  All right.  You want to tell Patty live in front of a lot of people where you're taking her?  Yeah, I think we should just walk there and let her see for herself.  We're only at a couple of storefronts down.  I agree.  All right.  Go take a little walk. 
[01:46:00]  Now put her on the phone.  In a few seconds, she will know.  Put her on the phone.  She's on the other phone.  Patty, are you excited?  Okay.  We're walking down 33rd Street.  We're just passing the store.  Right now, we're next door to where she's going to be spending her birthday money.  Here we are, Patty.  Are you excited?  Yeah.  Let's go inside.  Wait a minute.  We're going into an adult bookstore. 
[01:46:30]  Yes, happy birthday, Patty.  Happy birthday, Patty.  Oh, no.  I'm going to bring Patty to where she should be shopping.  No.  Patty, what's this?  It's a fest.  Well, they're either in a black power store or you've hit paydirt.  A lot of ding-dongs and all kinds of things. 
[01:47:00]  Cupcakes.  And a mini shark scooter.  I don't know what it does.  A what?  A shark scooter, but I don't know what it does.  A scooter?  Patty, describe what it looks like, Patty.  I know what it is.  It's a double-headed phallic symbol.  Patty, what color is it?  Black.  Of course.  Double-headed, right?  Yeah.  That's nice. 
[01:47:30]  Well, Patty, that's where you get to spend your money.  Nowhere else.  What are you going to pick up?  Batteries.  Oh, that's a little too big.  What?  What were you looking at, a pen?  Yeah.  All right, Rich.  Oh, wait.  I see vibrators with pearls in them inside.  Ah, those are the ones that spin around inside.  The little pearls spin around inside.  And the outside, it gives you a little texture. 
[01:48:00]  It whips around like a roto-rooter.  Why would you know that?  Why would you know that in detail?  Because I've been doing this stupid radio show for 10 years,  and I've seen every kind of sexual contraption brought in here.  I've seen that one with the beads inside, and they spin around.  It's like a spaceship.  Remember the time the guy tried to make a homemade toy?  Oh, God.  And we almost used it on a girl, and we just-  It was a Sawzall.  We just assumed that the guy was an expert at this. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  It was a Sawzall, a reciprocating saw.  The girl was ready.  The guy was ready.  With a fake, a rubber man's unit put on it,  and then he'd hit the trigger, and it would move forward and backwards really quickly.  It sounded like a good idea.  But the way he put it together, he took the actual Sawzall blade,  which is like a hacksaw blade, and just shoved it inside the rubber thing and glued it  so that within two seconds, the blade punctured through the side of the rubber device 
[01:49:00]  and would have just torn it up.  It just would have looked like a horrible scene out of a horrible horror movie.  Billy, it's going to be one of the chapters in our book, The Near Misses.  Near Miss.  That was a near miss.  That was a near miss.  Who's your Sawzall?  I would have given her one of those things, Sophie.  What's it called?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, now I forgot the name of it.  Apesiotomy.  Apesiotomy.  Yeah, we were sharing.  Right up to the throat.  We were sharing pregnancy stories, Bonnie and I. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, were you?  He's been pregnant three times.  Yeah.  It was real nice.  Patty.  Yes?  All right, so what do you got?  Anything else you see?  Well, I'm hoping this thing in my hand called My Vibe,  and it says,  Blush's line of vibrators were made with you in mind.  Each one is designed to keep you happy.  And once more, enjoy this magical product.  You deserve it.  Yeah, Patty's really holding on to this like she really wants.  Oh, that's the one she wants. 
[01:50:00]  That's the one she wants.  Everyone's happy today.  You phoned your new best friend.  Yeah.  We're trying to turn her into a...  There's a part on it that I don't think she's noticed yet.  What is it?  Patty, what do you think that part is for?  That?  I don't know.  Oh, is it toward the base?  Yeah.  And it kind of sticks out a little above?  It says multi-speed.  Yeah, that's for multiple stimulation on different parts of the body is what that is.  She sounds like she's shopping for like a blender. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  This one has multi-speed.  This is good.  This one can puree.  What?  Huh?  Maybe there's a set of...  Hey, we didn't hear.  She said she's going to need an instruction manual.  Oh, an instruction manual.  What do you need?  Because I don't know what parts of the body that other thing are.  Oh, your ear.  Danny.  Danny, is there any peep booths?  People working.  Oh.  Any what?  Any peep booths there?  Any books? 
[01:51:00]  No, peep booth.  I don't know why I can't say it.  Peep booths.  Oh, you guys got to go in.  Take her in a peep booth, man.  Take her to a buddy booth.  Show her a little movie.  Yeah.  Well, get into one of those and we'll talk to you next.  Make her go in with bare feet.  Oh, God.  And then pick her gun up off the floor.  Yeah.  Okay, no problem.  All right.  All right.  After the break, we'll check in with you guys in one of the booths.  Nothing better than hammer-toed footprints in a bunch of goo.  Oh, God.  Oh, no. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, she has hammer toes.  Oh, that'd be great just watching her corn chip toenails scrape little ruts in the goop  on the floor.  Oh, at least she got it in.  Very good.  Had to get it in there.  It's a corn chip toenails.  It's a corn chip toenail thing we're doing on the show.  Her toenail fungus.  All right.  Patty, you ready to go into one of those boots?  Yeah.  I'm looking at this really sexy, cool-looking underwear.  Sexy, cool-looking underwear.  Yeah.  Then it does not belong on you. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, I know.  Leave that to the pros.  That's polka dot brought top and tie side thong set.  Yeah, polka dots are so sexy.  Yeah.  How old year is this?  I'm looking at a nice swimsuit with a camisole.  Yeah.  She can dress like 1906 on Atlantic City.  I wear this on the steel pier and watch the horse diving.  With the handy zipper pocket.  For your ID.  All right.  Listen, we got a lot to do. 
[01:52:30]  So, Danny, when we get back, we'll have you guys in a booth.  All right?  Yep.  You got it, guys.  Show her a few movies.  And we got Billy Connolly.  We got Rich Voss and Bonnie.  They're playing the Stress Factory tonight and tomorrow.  And we got the 911 calls with the wheelchair guy.  The story of the day.  We'll play these next as well.  What do you think we should...  What movies do you think she should see?  Something gay?  Something...  What do they got there, Danny, to choose from?  Yeah, Danny, what do we got?  Oh, they got everything.  If you want, I could read off some of the titles that they have because they haven't displayed 
[01:53:00]  so you know what you're getting into.  All right.  Read off a couple of titles quickly.  Obviously.  Okay.  Let me try and get some that aren't going to get dumped out of.  Hardcore Partying.  Okay.  That sounds wonderful.  I can't say that.  Give it a try.  Okay.  Blackballed.  Blackballed.  Okay.  Okay.  You could say that.  Hmm.  BBW Dreams. 
[01:53:30]  The classic taboo.  They have a gag factor.  Gag factor?  Yeah, that's a good one.  Uh-huh.  Is it about practical jokes?  It could be.  Surprise.  I'm gone.  Gotcha.  Just kidding.  Any hardcore gay action?  Oh, yeah.  I just found that.  Yeah, I think she ought to see two men going at it. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  I found, let's see, bareback moments.  Ah.  Very nice.  And real urban stories.  All right.  I don't like that one.  It was shot poorly.  All right.  We got to take a break.  We'll get back to you guys after the break, okay?  Okay.  You got it.  Hey, in just over a half hour, we got...  Shot poorly on the guy's back?  Just over a half hour, we got $10 tickets going on sale for our comedy show at Jones Beach  a week from tomorrow at Jones Beach, okay?  Brought to you by Bud Light.  Always worth it. 
[01:54:30]  Nine comedians for $10.  A limited amount of these tickets going on sale at 9 a.m. through Ticketmaster.  And we got Voss and Bonnie will be at the Stress Factory this weekend, and Billy Connolly  is promoting Fido the movie.  It's out next Friday, June 15th, and his website is billyconnolly, C-O-N-N-O-L-L-Y.com.  I wish they gave us a screener's copy so we could talk about the movie a little bit.  I wish they did.  You'd like it.  It's a funny thing.  I'll definitely be checking it out.  Is it in New York showing?  Yeah, I guess.  I don't know.  I don't know why they do these things. 
[01:55:00]  He don't care.  He just does his thing.  I know where it is.  A quick download away.  That's right.  Damn computers, right?  Get rid of the middleman.  That's it.  Go right to the source.  It's Opie and Anthony.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  We'll check in with Stalker Patty and Danny right now.  Ant, you want to explain?  Maybe people are tuning in for the first time. 
[01:55:30]  What's going on with Stalker Patty today?  Stalker Patty's birthday was the other day.  We're celebrating a little late.  She's 52 years old.  Of course, she's a virgin untouched by a man's hands at 52 years old.  Sort of a social outcast.  And we figured we'd do her a favor, let her go on a little shopping spree.  She's broke.  She needs clothes.  She needs things for the summer.  So we decided to take her on a shopping spree to an adult store.  You know?  And you know what? 
[01:56:00]  She's not bummed out at all.  We're really turning her.  When last we heard, she was clinging on to this device.  She wouldn't let go.  This vibrating device that has these beads that rotate around inside of it.  And then has this little thing at the base that kind of sticks out because it's supposed  to hit multiple parts of the body.  No, it defluffs your belly button.  You've got to clean the lint off when you're done. 
[01:56:30]  She's holding on to it like she held on to her first stuffed animal.  Oh, yeah.  She wasn't going to let it go.  She wasn't going to let it go.  Oh, behave.  Oh, you love it.  Hey, Stalker Patty.  Yes?  All right.  So where are you now?  Are you in one of the booths?  Not yet.  They're going to take me into one of the booths now.  Ah.  I don't know.  It's just going to be another lady.  It's not going to be that exciting, but, you know.  All right.  Well, we'll be the judge of that. 
[01:57:00]  I've never been in anything like that before, anyway.  All right.  Danny?  You've never done anything.  And I saw a DBT, Granny's Gone Wild, number three.  Granny's Gone Wild.  That's a good one.  So many unanswered questions in one, too.  So I'm glad they got the trilogy finally figured out.  Granny number three.  That's just laziness, man.  You can't come up with a new granny title.  Well, you know they're all new in every movie because they die. 
[01:57:30]  Right.  Oh, I got a recast for granny again.  It's a guaranteed snuff movie every time.  We can really go out loud.  You never have to send a residual check out.  All right, Danny.  Recorded live at Forest Lawn.  That's good.  They don't even know what they're doing.  They think they're being washed.  The whole world's a vibrator when you're that age. 
[01:58:00]  It's called Parkinson's.  Granny's Three starring Pete the Mortician.  If we don't get these 911 calls in, people are going to kill us.  I know.  Danny, are you with Patty?  Yes, I'm with Patty.  They don't have a buddy one, so she's just going to have to go in by herself.  All right.  You can squeeze in there, can't you?  You can't squeeze in?  No, they won't let me.  I don't think they'll let me go in there with that.  Oh, like to peek over her shoulder? 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  Well, I'm going to see if they'll let her do it with the door open because obviously she's  not going to be doing anything.  So I'm going to give her five bucks.  Five dollars?  And she gets to watch as much as possible.  Here, Patty, here's money.  Patty, pictures don't come out either.  This is your birthday gift.  Enjoy.  Yeah.  Put the money in there and you change channels with those buttons.  How do you know, Danny?  There's a TV at home.  I've been here before.  May I call you Gumshoe? 
[01:59:00]  Gumshoe.  All right.  She's making her way in the little buddy booth.  All right, Patty, what do you got?  All right.  Wait.  I see a guy.  Yeah.  He's standing next to a yellow car.  Oh, I think I've seen that one.  That's a legendary one.  Patty, try to keep it clean for the radio. 
[01:59:30]  You know.  I don't know.  He's wearing a set of boxers or something.  All right.  Well, maybe you want to change the channel.  Maybe there's nothing going on in that one.  Jesus.  She found an episode of Taxi.  Yeah.  Let's go.  There's Al Roker.  Let's get the TV on.  But it's Taxi with three X's.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Couple, silly, nasty.  Oh, a couple. 
[02:00:00]  What?  A guy and a girl.  And they're doing the nasty thing.  The nasty.  Oh, the nasty thing.  Oh, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Hello?  Yeah.  What?  What?  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  What?  Uh-oh.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Why?  What's happening, Patty?  The girl on a guy.  Can you say that? 
[02:00:30]  Wait a minute.  No.  It's about four of them.  What's happening?  Oh.  Four guys.  They're going in the wrong way.  Oh, yes.  I've got to change the channel.  Change the channel.  She can't take it.  I don't know what's making the radio.  I think that Al had to dump something there, unfortunately.  Oh, my God.  Patty's seeing stuff she's never seen before.  Patty?  What?  Patty's doing a number one.  Huh?  She's doing a number one. 
[02:01:00]  And she's getting comfortable on a guy's lap.  Okay.  I don't understand.  I know that voice.  I don't think that'll make it.  No.  They're out in the middle of nowhere to outside.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What language are they speaking?  Oh, wait a minute.  Yes?  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  What now?  Definitely missionary. 
[02:01:30]  A what?  Missionary.  Wait a minute.  This one puts oil all over herself.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Can Danny hear us?  Probably very good for the skin, but...  Something else happening.  She's thinking of exfoliating.  Yeah, great.  Danny.  Yeah.  Find German films.  Something with a horse or caviar on the title.  I need something on every channel.  The girl is doing it both ways. 
[02:02:00]  What would you expect?  Green Acres to be on?  Patty, change the channel more.  ABC Family?  What is she looking for in there?  I'm looking for the prices right.  Change the channel.  All right, Patty.  Like, it's going to go away.  Should we, uh...  Patty, anything else?  Once in an office, they're doing a little bit of office thing.  Office thing?  Yeah.  What a way to go to work.  In an office.  I love how you can kind of hear the noises behind, you know, in the background. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, a little bit.  I'm trying to find her a good one.  But they have a pretty big selection here, so it's taking me a little...  There you go, Patty.  Wait a minute.  It's a guy on guy.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Two guys.  I don't know how to put it.  Breakfast.  Oh, he does.  Eating breakfast.  He's eating breakfast?  He's eating breakfast.  I've never heard it put that way.  Is that the latest prison term?  Does it look like he has a face full of grits?  No.  Does it look like he's enjoying his oatmeal a little too much? 
[02:03:00]  He's having a ball.  Did he just order turkey sausage?  I hope so.  I hope he's not eating dessert for breakfast and having some chocolate pudding.  Oh, too far.  Too far.  It could happen.  No, it's the boogie woogie bagel boy.  Hey, Patty, before you leave the booth, could you take your dry hair and mop up the floor?  Cactus head. 
[02:03:30]  Patty.  Oh, my.  Yes?  How is the floor in there?  Like, move your feet up and down.  Is it making noise?  My feet?  Yeah.  Nothing's making noise.  No?  It's not sticky on the floor or anything?  I brought her into one that was freshly mopped.  Oh, okay.  Why?  That's nice of you, Danny.  Patty, anything else?  Because we've got to move on to something else, and then we'll check back with you guys.  All right.  It's just a bunch of, wait a minute, this one's on a couch, a zebra couch. 
[02:04:00]  Zebra couch, nice.  Yeah, and there's two zebras.  Zebras?  Yeah.  Oh, wait, that one's wearing the Victoria's Secret type thing.  Aw.  She's talking about the clothes.  I know, and the couch.  The color of nail polish.  Yeah.  It's wonderful.  This one looks painful.  It's like we've been on hold.  All right.  We'll put them on hold.  This one looks painful, she says. 
[02:04:30]  A zebra will do that to you every time.  It certainly will.  We'll check in with them before we leave.  Hey, so the 911 calls from the wheelchair thing.  Yeah.  I saw the wheelchair guy on TV.  They put mud flaps on the back of his tires now.  I just saw it.  I saw the pictures on CNN.  His tires were on the highway.  Yeah.  The wheelchair tires were.  That's what I said.  His hand was smoking when he was holding it.  If you're just tuning in, wheelchair guy trying to cross the street.  Truck doesn't see him. 
[02:05:00]  The handles get stuck in the grill of the truck, and then he proceeds to go 40 to 50 miles an  hour with the wheelchair dude on the front of his truck.  Down the highway for four miles.  Four to five miles.  We had the story.  Now we got copies of the 911 calls, because now this thing is flying by people, and they're  like, oh my God, we've got to call 911.  It's like a FedEx commercial.  We'll get your cripple there in a day.  Yeah, listen to this 911 call.  911 emergency.  I'm at the corner of Hayden and Red Arrow. 
[02:05:30]  There is a westbound truck dragging a man in a wheelchair.  He did not see them crossing in front of him when the light changed.  He's out in front of the middle school right now.  He's westbound?  He's westbound.  Who doesn't know he's dragging this man?  Okay, we'll get help on the way.  Thank you.  Yep.  Now, you know, the man did not get hurt.  He had the ride of his life, you know, four or five miles, 50 miles down in front of  a...  This is just an amazing story.  That woman got a little emotional, but she was able to get the information out.  Right, right. 
[02:06:00]  Well, she got it wrong.  The truck was pushing him, not dragging him.  Right.  So they're looking at the wrong end of the truck, and they go, there's no wheelchair.  No, no.  The truck's fine.  This is not him.  This kid's on the front.  All right, let it go.  So she had a little panic in her voice, right?  Yeah.  What we're going to learn today is people handle tragedies a little different.  That lady had a little panic, but the next one...  Wow.  The next one's not a woman you want to be behind in any emergency on a plane or in a fire where 
[02:06:30]  you have to get out quickly.  Yeah.  Because she's the one that they just show screaming and crying in the middle of a disaster  in everybody's way.  Right.  911 emergency.  Hello?  This is 911.  Where are you?  I am on.  I have no idea.  I'm on the...  I'm in Pawpaw, obviously.  I'm on an office.  You're dead, you're dead.  So I'm with my client.  Okay, okay. 
[02:07:00]  Stop yelling.  I can't understand you.  Where are you?  I'm sorry.  I don't know.  I'm in Pawpaw.  It looks like I'm by the middle school.  And my client, he's been a wheelchair.  He went to class this week.  And somebody didn't stop.  And it's still going.  He's on the phone.  I'd hang up on her.  Okay, on Michigan Avenue in front of the middle school?  Yes, I'm in the middle school.  Okay, what is your name?  My name's Jeremy.  Okay, we'll get help over there.  Sounds like she's being chased with us.  Yeah, what is it?  She couldn't even get it out even remotely. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Where are y'all?  Where are you?  The United States!  It's a middle school.  It's a truck.  It's a wheelchair.  I'm like, what?  If that truck hits somebody, who do you sue?  The trucker or the wheelchair?  I think technically the wheelchair rear-ends somebody.  That's right.  It's his fault.  Any idea how the guy got in the wheelchair in the first place?  Like, what was...  Just lazy. 
[02:08:00]  How'd he get their bed jeans?  Mother had one shot too many.  Someone didn't stop smoking when they were supposed to.  Fainted in a store and hit her head.  Oh!  Oh, no.  Wow, nice callback.  Callback of the day.  How is he, the guy?  I mean, is he...  Completely fine.  They just interviewed him on CNN.  We got that audio, too.  Ben Carpenter was unharmed, but was taken to a hospital as a precaution. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, he has a muscular dystrophy.  His eyes are still watering, though.  That's just mean and hurtful.  Oh, by the way, this is Jen continuing with her 911 call.  I'm calling to Dessie and CI.  West Michigan Avenue in front of Papa Nightfield.  Jen, you need to calm down.  I have help on the way.  She made it about her.  Now the 911 operator has to calm her down.  Yeah, instead of, like, maybe trying to save this kid from... 
[02:09:00]  Meanwhile, this guy's still just zooming down the street at 50, while this woman is just...  The operator should have egged her on.  Oh, my God, yes, we know the case.  He's also holding puppies.  Oh, my God!  And if the truck goes over 70 miles an hour, you know, everything's going to explode.  My colleague's advising me, semi hit a subject in a wheelchair, the semi continued westbound 
[02:09:30]  on Michigan.  Jen?  Yes?  Okay, what direction did the semi go in?  Did it go westbound?  I don't know.  It's going, like, I'm...  I don't know what direction it is.  Is it going out of town or into town?  It's going out of town, I believe.  Okay, can you give me a description of it?  It was just...  It was like...  It didn't have a trailer.  It was white.  Okay, white semi-tractor.  Yes.  Yeah, it didn't...  It's got a wheelchair on the front.  It wasn't holding a trailer.  Okay.  Like, the cat...  Hold on. 
[02:10:00]  Yes, it's a Kenworth.  It looked to be white with a bit of rust, and there's a cripple on the front of it.  How much description do you need?  Yeah, really?  Truck, wheelchair, end.  I know.  Like, there's five of these out there.  Yeah, they put one over the guy in the wheelchair.  He's like, no, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  I just decided...  It's going to work like this every day.  Right.  And if it saves on gas mileage, it's terrific.  And if it's going out of town, that means it's going into town somewhere, too.  Right, right.  What's it matter?  She continues. 
[02:10:30]  Jim, where are you at right now?  I'm standing, like, I'm just past, um, through the street.  I can't see.  I'm, like, across from Game and Blaze.  Did she just teleport there?  She's just the worst.  I don't know where she is.  She's terrible.  She's from Nevada, 1536.  It's a very late summer, a tractor with no fireworks.  Sounds like what I was playing in Patty's Buddy Booth.  That's exactly what I was thinking. 
[02:11:00]  That amazingly similar to porn movies.  Oh!  Would it be great if you realized she was laughing?  Are you okay?  Yeah, this is just a scream.  You'll never believe this.  This guy's in panic.  I'm sorry.  I'm trying to call you and take pictures with my cell phone at the same time.  My friends aren't going to believe this.  Oh, my God.  Some amusement park's going to have truck wheelchair rides pretty soon.  Hey, Kevin from Connecticut on the Instant Feedback. 
[02:11:30]  Was the guy in the wheelchair going,  Whee!  Yeah.  All right, finally, the last of this one from Jen.  There you go again.  She lost it.  Okay, Jen, I have an officer in front of the middle school.  Where are you?  No, look at me right now.  I just saw him turn around.  I'm, like, to any corner.  Like, I'm right in, like, the whole getting search agency.  Huh? 
[02:12:00]  Huh?  She saw him turn around?  The cop.  Oh, the cop.  Yeah, the cop finally said, wow, I think I might have to stop that truck.  It's a lunatic.  Why would 911 ask where the caller is?  They did.  Because she's panicking.  So they're saying, where are you?  They assume you're by wherever it is.  It's a problem.  Because she needs an ambulance, too, now.  Yeah.  For whatever's going on with her.  Lost her mind.  Hey, we're running out of show, but they talked to the kid on CNN a few minutes ago.  First of all, tell us exactly how this happened. 
[02:12:30]  Well, I was crossing the light for the traffic was red.  I crossed in front of him.  It must have turned green as soon as I got out there.  Ah, okay.  So he had no idea.  Right there.  Right there.  Sorry.  I drive in Manhattan, and I can't stand pedestrians in the first place.  And if you're in a wheelchair or you're an old person, this might sound insensitive,  but it's for your own safety.  You've got to look.  If that hand is flashing, it means it's going to say, don't walk pretty soon. 
[02:13:00]  Don't try to cross.  Yeah.  Wait.  The second it turns green, then you go.  Or you're going to end up getting run over.  Well, obviously, this kid has a death wish.  Anthony, that doesn't sound insensitive at all.  It is.  I understand what I'm saying.  This kid sounds like a rambunctious punk.  At the time, what happened after that, you obviously became entangled in the grill,  and then, what did you do?  What?  What? 
[02:13:30]  By the way.  I put on my iPod and just enjoyed the ride.  What do you think I did?  Exactly.  Mexican food and a flu.  You do the math.  So you think I did.  Let me tell you, we're talking seriously bad hair.  What did I do?  I started yelling.  I'm planning my jump over the Caesar's Palace fountains.  By the way, this is the same CNN anchor that interviewed Spelling Bee from earlier this morning.  She's got her plate full today.  She just knows what question to ask. 
[02:14:00]  It would be a great ride at Disneyland, wouldn't it?  Oh, absolutely.  Here it is again.  We're running out of show.  Just sit in that wheelchair.  He needs to handle it.  Back to the future.  Well, the good thing, the people at the bus stop didn't have to wait for that lift to  come down.  Wouldn't it be funny if the trucker actually used, like, stepped on the guy's leg and then  his face to get into his hood?  By the way, we got it.  Any freeze in there?  We got to speed up.  Old Buzzkill's going to be coming through that door any second. 
[02:14:30]  He was uninjured until the little metal bulldog fell on his head.  Little metal bulldog up your ass?  It's become one of those stories about people who turn up at hospital in the middle of the  night.  You'll never guess how this bulldog ended up here in the X-ray of my pelvis, sir.  I was crossing the street when a tractor trailer.  Minding my own business.  Right.  When a reporter asked, how did you feel?  He said, well, from the waist up. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, oh, wretch, wretch.  I scuffed my previously unused sneakers.  Oh, oh.  Not good, not good.  Let's try to get through this before old Buzzkill comes through that door.  Buzzkill.  What happened after that?  You obviously became entangled in the grill and then...  Entangled.  How sensitive could you get?  You don't even realize how funny this is because the same lady... 
[02:15:30]  That lady was interviewing Spilling Beat dude with the same dumb, awful questions and observations.  Is it true that a wheelchair kid actually got caught in Tom Chiasano's braces when he was  walking?  What happened after that?  You obviously became entangled in the grill and then, uh, what'd you do?  Oh, I guess I just went along for the ride. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, that's my hero!  That guy's great.  That guy's great.  My hero!  He's great.  Love this guy.  What did I do?  I checked my messages.  I texted a friend.  What did you do?  What did I do?  I had flashbacks of how I got here.  I at last made a start on War and Peace.  Well, I guess I just went along for the ride.  Oh, my hero! 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, you're so cool and calm about it, but you must have been terrified.  No.  Yeah, I was.  Yes, but I have muscular dystrophy and I can't do anything but this expression.  Are you paying attention, lady?  Yeah, really.  Did you see that happening to Stephen Hawking?  Please stop the vehicle.  Could you please stop the vehicle?  I was yelling for help.  Help.  Help.  Please help me.  Earth is doomed.  Let me see how fast I'm going. 
[02:17:00]  Velocity plus time divided.  Doing like a formula.  The driver's all, why are you all up in my grill?  One more quick clip here.  The tickets are going on sale in seconds.  We've got so much to wrap up here still.  What did the truck driver say to you afterward?  I don't remember what he said.  Something about the mess and the hood of the car.  Yeah, I mean, I'm sure it was the...  Sorry.  Probably couldn't remember what was going on because it was so overwhelming at the time, 
[02:17:30]  but they say four miles, hitting speeds of 50 miles an hour, and at no point, the semi  didn't hit anything, and you're not hurt at all this morning, are you?  At no point.  Did you crap your pants?  She just wanted to get something out.  And the kid's like, hey, it was a great ride.  What did the driver say?  Just leave the fuel and walk away.  Just walk away.  Lord of the wasteland, humongous.  Or if the driver came out and went, you scratched my paint, clumsy boy. 
[02:18:00]  Two days ago, I saw a rig that'll hold that cripple.  He probably came out and went, oh, cripples.  Smokey in the burden.  Oh, wow.  With that, we're going to wrap up.  Stalker Pat, are you still there?  Yeah, I'm still there.  Did you enjoy your shopping spree at the adult bookstore?  It was kind of fun.  It was interesting. 
[02:18:30]  It wasn't a pair of shorts or sneakers, but it was something far more educational.  All right, what are you going to buy?  What?  You're buying that thing you...  Well, I got the purple thing.  I don't know if I can say it.  All right, the purple thing, sure.  I got the grannies gone wild so I can see what old people do.  Look in the mirror.  Oh, my gosh.  She went with grannies gone wild.  Look in the mirror.  All right.  Yeah, really.  All right, listen, Patty, happy birthday.  Danny, really fast because we've got to get off the air. 
[02:19:00]  Danny, lost you?  Anything to add?  No, but Patty, I just want you guys to know that she picked out her DVD on her own.  We did no coercion.  That was all her.  So she's into that old woman fetish thing.  That's good.  Hey, Patty, we want you to give us a review of the movie on Monday, okay?  All righty.  No problem.  All right.  Have a good weekend.  We've got to get off the air.  Thank you, Patty.  Real quick.  Happy birthday.  We've got to promote real quick a couple things.  First, Billy Connolly.  The movie is Fido.
