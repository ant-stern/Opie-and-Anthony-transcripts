<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion about Art Bell's departure from SiriusXM, with Opie and Anthony attributing it to technical issues with the online player, a limited listener base, and difficulties for international listeners—problems they'd experienced themselves. They contrasted this with their own improved working conditions following a management change. The conversation then segued into a discussion of Richie Incognito's behavior, initially focusing on hazing allegations, before escalating to details of racist and threatening voicemails, text messages, and a video of Incognito's erratic behavior in a bar.  The hosts' initial reaction evolved from mild criticism to stronger condemnation as more information emerged.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a heated debate with a caller, Steve from Chicago, about the n-word. Steve argued that the hosts' condemnation was insensitive and cliché, citing its casual use among young Black people in his neighborhood.  This sparked a lengthy and contentious exchange about the word's context, power, and historical significance, involving several callers and excerpts from songs containing the n-word. The discussion broadened to encompass wider issues of race, racism, and cultural norms.  This topic reappeared later, with further discussion on the n-word's prevalence on Twitter and in a YG song, its use as a term of endearment within some communities, and its varying usage by different racial groups.

The show also addressed radio stations' reactions to tragedies, specifically the removal of songs deemed insensitive following events like shootings or plane crashes.  The hosts debated the appropriateness and effectiveness of this practice, contrasting reactions to the JFK assassination and 9/11 with more recent events.  A news report about a mall shooting where the perpetrator died by suicide was also briefly mentioned, along with the subsequent discussion about playing music related to the shooter's name.  The hosts also mentioned an upcoming SiriusXM event celebrating Art Bell's birthday, highlighting the irony of celebrating someone who had sued the company, and shared anecdotes about attending previous SiriusXM events. A Jimmy Kimmel Halloween prank segment about parents eating their children’s candy was played and discussed.

The broadcast included discussions on parenthood, featuring anecdotes from Opie, Anthony, and a caller, Steve, about their children's behavior.  They reviewed *Grown Ups 2*, criticizing the film and its cast, particularly Melissa McCarthy's performance.  A segment featured a clip of Opie seemingly bullying a cereal-company employee (Roland), leading to social media criticism and an apology from Opie. A near-catastrophic skydiving incident caught on video was shown, along with a news story about Lee Harvey Oswald's widow still living in Dallas.  Mike Francesa’s radio show, his perceived dislike of hockey, and a caller's question about Aaron Rodgers and Diet Coke were also discussed.  Clips from the Ron and Fez show, featuring discussions about bearded animals and a caller’s incoherent blueberry description, were played.  Kanye West's use of the Confederate flag in his merchandise was debated, exploring its historical context and various interpretations. The North's motives during the Civil War were also discussed.  Governor Chris Christie's political prospects and perceived stance on gay rights were discussed.  An anticipated guest appearance by Oliver Stone was ultimately canceled due to his lateness, leading to an early end to this portion.  Throughout the show, there were interspersed discussions regarding holiday gift ideas and Steven Singer Jewelers.

A significant portion of the show revolved around Oliver Stone's late arrival.  The hosts devised a punishment for lateness, involving signing numerous items.  They recounted encounters with unsuspecting celebrities, including a potential sighting of James Cromwell.  They briefly discussed Art Garfunkel's age (incorrectly) and a Russian teen allegedly auctioning her virginity online.  The impromptu interview with Oliver Stone covered his documentary "Untold History of the United States," his views on Truman, Eisenhower, the JFK assassination, and the Cuban Missile Crisis, and his filmmaking process. This was followed by an unexpected appearance by DJ Who Kid, who shared his conspiracy theories about the JFK assassination and 9/11, and his perspective on George W. Bush's role.  Listener calls and further banter ensued.  The hosts speculated on the impact of Oliver Stone’s perceived judgment of Sam Roberts.

Finally, Sam recounted his impromptu interview with Oliver Stone, mentioning his on-the-spot preparation and pre-interview research.  A caller, Chris from Georgia, discussed Dick Cheney and Halliburton.  This transitioned into a humorous advertisement read for Steven Singer Jewelers by DJ Who Kid. The show concluded with a segment featuring a former intern, "Handsome Rob," who was in the studio.  They discussed his infamous last day as an intern, which involved showing up in a pig costume, throwing Egg McMuffins and Monopoly money, and yelling "I'm nagling it," stemming from a prior incident involving a pool party lie.  Rob revealed he received a "Do Not Hire" evaluation from his supervisor, Eric. The segment, like much of the show, was punctuated with vulgar language and sexually suggestive humor.

[00:01:00]  the gossip ball around a little bit before the show big throw it or we like to throw it around  like the ladies do right down the hall the girls the chicks i'm uh i'm a fan of art bell and i guess  he's leaving serious xm right he's had it and my my question was didn't he just get here yes the  answer is yes he got here september i want to say like september 16th middle of september whatever 
[00:01:30]  yeah and he's had it he's leaving what are aliens taking him away is that what it is uh no no he's  very frustrated by the technology around here you know really and and we're mentioned in the article  as well as uh howard and jay thomas all having similar complaints about serious xm wow yeah art bell  leaves serious xm i was just listening to him this morning i love art bell now i didn't even listen to 
[00:02:00]  him ever before and he's already leaving well art bell the radio icon that joined serious xm's lineup  on september 16th oh no is leaving the air after just a month and a half while passionate satellite  radio fans may not want to hear it his reasons for leaving boiled down to three main things and these  are the points we have been making for wow okay let's see what art says serious xm's web player is  notoriously unreliable causing a loss of subscribers and a degraded uh listening experience for those who 
[00:02:30]  remain listening online i don't know what he's talking about that's crazy basically the online  listening is a nightmare we get we get complaints every single day about that every day every single  day we get complaints about that where i don't even pass them along to those um can't say idiots  anymore because that's right the idiots down the hall remember them yeah i can't really call them  idiots because we have you know tim sabian is trying to well tim sabian is still collecting info but 
[00:03:00]  eventually he's going to start working for the channel is he still collating he's still collating  collating information he's having individual meetings with uh the entire staff including club  soda candy everyone gets about an hour exactly he's he's gathering he's gathering info and eventually  he's an idiot and eventually he's going to get on it and make this channel way better yeah but just  having him aboard has made the show a lot better because we feel like we're in good hands well i like  the fact that we don't have to deal with the idiots down the hall no that that to me is such a plus 
[00:03:30]  how nice is it to just wave go hi dude how are you how great has it been since because they have just  had nothing to do with this show because i'm i'm a motherfucker some would call me a psycho  but you know when it's over it's over right like you know i have nothing bad to say about gary and  steve and and because remember the rob cross guy i i guess he's not here which one was he i i have not 
[00:04:00]  seen him since the change erot comment rob stops by once in a while he's still very uh very friendly  with everybody oh that's nice now that there's no management role uh between him and us so he's very  cool he comes and he hangs out everyone else doesn't even acknowledge when we say hi with the  tumultuous relationship and then all of a sudden uh you break up but you still see each other and  then it's just like that weight is off your shoulder it's like yeah i don't have to deal with this 
[00:04:30]  anymore so it's fine but gary avoids us at all costs i've seen him once since the change i think  maybe twice maybe twice but hi gary how are you and it doesn't even matter i'm not gonna kick him  anymore not seeing not seeing them them outside right like like vultures on the branch of a dying  tree uh uh outside that door when we leave here every day it it's so special to me i think it  really proves they really didn't want anything to do with us nothing because don't you think after 
[00:05:00]  after the management change if they were really into the radio show and what we're doing they would  have said something since like i know i'm not involved anymore but i just want to tell you  you know when you guys were talking about that thing or whatever they don't even know we're still  on the on the platform you think they still work here what you think you think we're off their  presets yeah yeah the open the opian andy show right is that that was that them yeah they're having 
[00:05:30]  this conversation with each other isn't it nice to see those two assholes of course and i'm so i'm so  fine with that i'm not not thinking this is one-sided they're they're they're freaking having a blast oh  they're talking about us do dying out this door every fucking day they love they have nothing to do with  this show anymore by discussing you know my blood pressure has dropped uh drastically my high blood  pressure seems to have gone away since uh leaving that show my wife says i look younger right asked  if i changed my hair i think i got a hint of a hair follicle since leaving that channel 
[00:06:00]  i do believe there's a possibility i might get a few extra hairs out of it yeah he's got a full head  of hair now he's got a charlie brown thing happening a couple of sprouted out of his head jesus um  anyway so art bell supposedly is leaving he all right he didn't like the uh the app uh three main  reasons sirius xm's web player is notoriously unreliable i don't understand why this is still 
[00:06:30]  an issue it's run by the i could easily care the affordable health care website i could easily go  uh and look back on my twitter from yesterday and i'm sure there's a few complaints from yesterday i'm  sure so he's like frustrated by that uh then he says uh for a caller driven show the caller pool for  art show is just too small ah we we have uh run into that we knew that when we first started here  now coming from any w right uh we we had fucking thousands of callers it was a at any given moment 
[00:07:00]  reminds full remember when our show started three the phones were already lit with a whole bunch of  things people want to talk about yes i think it's just different uh i i do think it's probably a  smaller audience than our new w heyday although now it's spread out across the entire country which  we didn't have in the past uh but i mean when we get on a kind of a hot topic then the phones  definitely light up yeah they're there but in general they're not they're just you know wanting 
[00:07:30]  to shoot the shit but i don't think but i don't think people use the the phone in the same way  the same way they used to and and art bell i think especially if you're just moving over here  it takes a while to cultivate an audience uh and especially one that's going to be proactive and  call you in the middle of the night in the middle of the night right right and he is a very you know  caller based kind of you know interaction with the audience guy i swear to you at this point  and maybe you can back me out i think i i think i make one phone call a week maybe 
[00:08:00]  yeah yeah i'm not i think that's about it every once in a while i gotta you know check in make  sure everything's cool at home and and that's about it i was everything else is just text messages  to people yes i was on the phone yesterday and and it was with the verizon so you know you got to  sit there on hold for a little while and stuff right three times during the call i when i was on  hold this is no bullshit three times right during the call i went to look for my phone to look at 
[00:08:30]  twitter and stuff oh really it's at my ear it was at my ear oh that's hilarious but you i was looking  like oh i'm on hold i need something to do where's my phone oh it's on my ear and do it like five  minutes later like oh where's my phone it's like clicking on the light switch when um when the lights  are out when you have no power right it's this just a habit now but but you don't you're not used  to making phone calls anymore i mean looking back a bunch of years ago you think could you imagine 
[00:09:00]  that we'd have this amazing technology where you could just tap in a few numbers and then you could  like talk to someone you know wherever the fuck they are in the country but then you move forward  and go you know what that's that's dumb i don't want that i gotta write to them i need to just send  them words that's ridiculous it's ridiculous so uh for a caller driven show the caller pool of art show  is just too small and then uh it says uh international listeners have no legitimate way 
[00:09:30]  to hear the show international listeners yeah because satellite doesn't really go overseas we  have we have quite the audience overseas now how but they have found other ways right right the show  and you know you know he that would happen with him but it takes eventually takes a little time for  the for the boys to set up shop how was it how was he getting an international audience before  iraq comment iraq student of radio probably had the bbc yeah bbc a lot of the stations that he was on 
[00:10:00]  were streaming online okay you could get through all right all right yeah that makes sense okay  but you can't you can't like subscribe over in like fucking oyerland uh but if he just had a website  that way all right i'm in well i mean technically if you had a login you could work around or what  but not i hear you legitimate way right right oh god de blasio is oh there he is afro kid today 
[00:10:30]  fucking big-headed let me finish this let me get into de blasio we're about to get a shitty mayor here  in new york city enjoy new york a shitty mayor and we made fun of bloomberg my god i wish bloomberg  was around for another four years it's gonna be snake pliskin city right uh the departure of  art bell as unfortunate as it is should be a signal to sirius xm ah this is uh one of these  i told you so moments that's about to be uh said here by the way it's on his uh website oh he oh did 
[00:11:00]  he write it uh no i guess serious buzz which kind of writes about so i got you yeah or now just  sirius xm i think they used to write for you know uh for both uh stuff about both companies  um the company has a compelling product great content and great potential that sounds good i  absolutely agree with that oh that sounds very nice but in some ways has lost the edge that it  once had i've said that you've said that as well we had a huge lead over all the other all the other 
[00:11:30]  um entertainment uh options that right there yeah uh see the frustrations of bell can be heard on  other channels as well opian anthony howard stern jay thomas and others have all at times expressed a  great deal of frustration in some ways the complaints of on-air personalities ring back to  the old fm days of terrestrial radio a path that many consumers and on-air personalities could not wait  to get away from true that true that yeah i believe sirius xm had a huge lead yeah and now 
[00:12:00]  like you know everyone's kind of catching up and we bitch and complain about the the web player and  it's still not not i want to say perfect i guess it's never going to be perfect but it's still not  efficient yeah you know what though art's got it like it's it's a fucking month i mean i think he's  got a he should give it a little time and and be resourceful try to find some workarounds like we  have right you know there's things you can do to boost your audience and right and shit like that 
[00:12:30]  you're in a new if he went to if he went to another fm station it takes time to build an audience and  have them find out where you are and stuff why so quickly i understand being frustrated and stuff  but how about bitching at him and stuff a month doesn't even give you time to to fucking get through  any corporate smoke screen are you are you actually asking why have you ever heard art bell  all right his brain his brain works a little differently doesn't think like normal people 
[00:13:00]  okay but isn't he under contract so what is he talking about that's what i'm thinking maybe all  this shit that he's pouring out there is some kind of breach of contract thingy right he retired in  2003 and like you said he's been back for a month and a half the reason the caller pool is small is  because he hasn't built a show that's true you got to really kind of sure build up a fucking audience  all right so that's uh that's going on i i hope art bell stays because uh i i love art bell  yeah he's a weirdo i used to listen to him a lot back in the day not so much uh you know since 
[00:13:30]  september yeah actually i gotta admit i don't think i've no i have not heard him since he came to  serious xm yeah i haven't either i listen to him when i'm driving in yeah oh do you what was he talking  about today he's talking about uh how his hobby he had the caller on the phone because he keeps the  one guest on the phone for the whole two or three hour show what and then he takes callers to call  in and talk to him but this one guy had evidence that human humanity started on mars okay sure so 
[00:14:00]  that was the whole gist that's believable yeah all right human race actually started on mars yeah i  don't think we're from here i don't i just don't think humans are from here i happen to think that  the solar system uh you got kind of uh you know earth right now yeah and and i i think that the  the planets like they trade off like mars was the big fucking the big wig of the solar system  they were the rock star for a long time they were the ones with the life and the fucking everything  like that they were like the led zeppelin right and then as things change with the sun maybe and 
[00:14:30]  other things of the different planets gravitational pull this that the other thing life on mars kind  of dwindled away and then life on earth starts up and then before you know it like you know  maybe fucking venus will get it or or fucking saturn or some shit and the mars people they  had the technology and they did a little skipperoo right i was reading uh yesterday there's like  billions of planets just like earth just to start to figure out i forgot the exact number but it was 
[00:15:00]  in the billions land water atmosphere billions of planets out there that are just like earth yeah  of course there's life out there's gotta be something crawling around see we don't need uh neil degrasse  oh we could use our own brains there's life out there it's obvious it's gotta be come on and the  grays like that's what they call the aliens the great grays they've been uh you know kind of with  us ever since we uh started recording time that alien look is silly the grays the grays and if you 
[00:15:30]  think about them in like spaceships in flying saucers or or what we typically think of some  extraterrestrial ship right it doesn't make any sense right their body type their big long fingers  aren't conducive to buttons and switches and things they all gotta duck their heads yeah we we put these  aliens with different body types and and appendages into these machines that we would be familiar and be  able to work in and if you have and if you're so advanced technologically why would you why would 
[00:16:00]  you make yourself look so damn ugly well you think they should gussy themselves up i don't know like  you know pick your favorite broad and you know all the all the grays look like that broad and pick  your favorite dude out there for for the people that are into that and why don't some have beards or  makeup or fucking like different hairstyles they all look exactly the same exactly the same yeah  there's more to this art thing than than the article oh a conspiracy all right let me uh let's go to 
[00:16:30]  patrick who's a fan of art bell he probably knows more go ahead patrick why don't you call him you  fucking idiot you may really you're the reason he's leaving give the give the poor sap a phone call  holy shit about this on the show right um but george nori from coast to coast which was part of that  clear channel block that just left xm also um our bell's been talking george nori told uh a lot of the  guests which they share between the two shows that if they go on our bell show they can no longer be 
[00:17:00]  on coast to coast so our bell's been losing all of his guests because obviously coast to coast was a  bigger show and those guests you know they're have a small niche anyway so they don't want to leave  the george nori coast to coast show so they've been leaving our felon he's been having a hard time  getting guests well he's got to give it a little time to get roland right i agree what's coast to  coast by the way that's our bell's old show that now the other dude hosts oh so wow so they just 
[00:17:30]  replaced art bell yeah they just put in another idiot another idiot all right that's that statement  has plenty of implications i don't know something with the grays yeah aka aliens yeah they find them  on like cave walls and stuff yeah is that do they really or is it like those things because i've  seen those too remember the ancient astronauts uh movie that came out yeah chariots of the gods  years ago and and they're like here is paintings on a cave wall that obviously shows a man in a 
[00:18:00]  spaceship it's like ah could be some guy sitting on a log oh really yeah they're all very um well why  can't just be their imagination like they're bored in a cave and they're like you know what yeah we  could we could think up some shit here yeah they like to make our day go by a little faster right  well i'm not drawing fucking like saber-toothed tigers uh when we're hunting that i'll draw something  like we're flying all right look you could just fly like a bird all right you could you could draw 
[00:18:30]  like a weird head look i'm doing right now look look some weird really long squiggly arms oh that's  proof of ancient aliens right there if that was on a fucking cave wall you go obviously aliens were  walking around prove right there ancient aliens here put this on a wall i want this to be found  someday yeah why couldn't they just have imaginations yeah let's pump this shit up no it always comes  why did it have to be everything that was perfectly happening at that time very literal instead of 
[00:19:00]  people maybe fucking around and going oh let's uh you know let's make our life experience a little  a little more interesting yeah hieroglyphics can never just be some fucking egyptians version of  a comic strip yeah some goofball something that yeah i want to fucking write some fantasy here on  this yeah yeah some fan fiction some fan fiction like eric right art uh what the reason that he quit  because he said it did he officially quit yeah it said this is his quote then what were you listening  to an old show yeah they're replaying his show oh they got 20 of them in the can yeah 
[00:19:30]  um he goes uh i started the show with the expectation that my listeners would be able  to stream the show since then we're coming from a.m and then he said they started the 30-day trial and  found out it was dropping out on them every few minutes after the 30-day trial most did not renew  why would they face paying 180 bucks a year for something that was not working right what would  you do so i lost my base my show is based on colin if all i am left with is truck drivers 
[00:20:00]  love them but their cell connections are not good with cell phones going down the road at 70 miles per  hour well you get the idea good point and then he says so i asked sirius to allow free streaming for  a year until they could fix their problems and they said no the show was simply not viable under  these conditions wow so he just he left so he's like yeah you have to offer your subscription  service for free or i'm gone wow yeah so he's looking for a listener that has a hard line at home 
[00:20:30]  yes yeah so the signal doesn't drop out he wants old school that's ridiculous yeah and then he's acting  like his conditions like yes i want you to make this viable for oh like they used to get calls  from all these women who are like i just hooked it up at my 97 year old mother's house the other day  right right they all bought all their equipment and year-long subscriptions and all this stuff yeah 
[00:21:00]  he's just like well until you can offer it for free can't have this right you know what you know  it's great it's very reminiscent though when you when you read that remember when we first started  on satellite it was the only calls you got were from truck drivers the only calls yep everyone was a  truck driver they were incredibly dedicated to the service very dedicated they were really the first  ones that got it because they're driving cross country they right they don't like uh having to  retune in their radio every few miles so satellite's a very good option for the truck drivers and but 
[00:21:30]  that's the only people that had it back then i totally uh get that because when we were off the  air for the two plus years yeah i did a lot of just driving around it was perfect yeah holy shit  wait i can listen to this show from here to florida which i did i did that drive a couple times  but they're the first people they're the first people that are going to sample a new show or  right stuff like that so they're the first people that are going to be calling in and then they uh  share the info with each other cell phone going down the road 75 that's a well conjures up a great 
[00:22:00]  image how do you it's kind of where we are right now in our civilization yeah how do you just make it  work how do you guys feel your show was on xm a month and a half into your contract we were  miserable oh yeah you should have walked it was uh we had no choice that's true we were miserable we  were talking to nobody yeah that was real we were on a premium on top of it yeah i remember they they  had a big cardboard cutout announcing that they had two million subscribers i think was it two million 
[00:22:30]  over the entire platform over the entire platform and then you do the math and go fuck we have like  if we even have ten percent of that which we didn't we didn't even have that it was that would  be two hundred thousand uh you know listeners and there was no way we had anywhere near that  we were told like oh we got twenty thousand oh that's what it was and it's like oh that's right  we were on the premium channel so they would give us numbers and go good news twenty thousand people  have signed up for for your channel and that's people that signed up they're never all listening at 
[00:23:00]  once right so i mean we were talking to nobody a few thousand probably yeah yeah and then eric logan  thank god he came around and showed you panero the way thank god it's like this is ridiculous you got  to open these guys up to everybody i'm hearing a lot of from a lot of people that um are saying they  can't get us anymore on the new radios in the new car and i don't know what that's all about i don't  think that's true i think yeah in the new cars they just have to get the package so it's a serious 
[00:23:30]  radio in the car right if you call up and get the best of xm package yeah but that's that's the other  point i've been making for a long time and actually i told sabian and he's like well that's crazy and  supposedly he's gonna get that done too i i told his face i'm like you know i i i wish you nothing  but the best and right obviously me and aunt respect you and we've done good things with you in the past  but i i told him i don't believe anything you're saying and i go it has nothing to do with you it's  just like we've been told so many different things over the years it's really hard to believe anybody 
[00:24:00]  around here yeah but but my my point to him was look you got to make this shit easy for the people  they don't understand they they have a car with an xm unit yeah to the company it's everything but to  them if they go and get a car that has serious they just think that they can't get our channel they  don't understand these best of packages and all that shit yeah yeah i don't even understand and i work  here right so you think they're gonna erot comment they don't tell you when you buy the new  car about the packages right right my brother got a new car with the serious unit in there and he 
[00:24:30]  didn't know to switch over of course no one knows that they just assume oh i got my satellite radio  in my car great all right let me tune into where are they my opian anthony yeah and it's not there  so they're like oh my new car doesn't get it yeah that's where that stuff's coming from that the  you know the subscribers are not educated enough to understand all this stuff they're so stupid and  the one thing you learn about business you got to make it easy extremely easy or you're gonna lose  customers and that's uh what's happening as i told sabian like i mean could you at least get us on uh 
[00:25:00]  the same channel on both units yeah and he couldn't believe it he's like wait that's not the case right  i'm like no no and they i go they switched the channels around recently and those guys down the hall  thought it would make perfect sense to have us on is it 105 now no 103 yes all right well i'm not  even joking i'm really not even joking for which platform 103 is xm yes and 206 yes okay oh but  see i said 105 and i really meant it i really meant it it's easier to remember now because you just 
[00:25:30]  double one right 103 is 206 if you double it's fine i told bladder and i told greenstein i'm like look  you're now moving channels around that why don't you just make it easy have us on the same one you  own the company you could do that oh we can't some reason well we can't do that so i don't know the  serious technology we were able to do that but the xm is weird man i would just make it extremely easy 
[00:26:00]  just really really easy yeah and upgrade the web player and then you know oh the web player  fucking that fucking word times out because it assumes you're not listening anymore is that  no when when you're listening to a talk show it's kind of there all day when you have that kind of  a show on there yes he rocks you know how they promote the music channels where you can have it  on your house uh for parties or like the holiday channel yeah it's exactly what hope said so you put  it on like oh this is great it's good 20 minutes all of a sudden all all of it goes off and says are 
[00:26:30]  you still there so you have to go running back to the computer i've done this okay i've done this in  my house i've put on uh serious uh at my house downstairs from playing poker or whatever yeah  and um i've had to stop and put on like pandora or something because because it'll just stop every  20 minutes like what what the fuck is that about it's the only radio that assumes you're not listening  active and fucking you gotta have a little more confidence it's like a hatch and lost you gotta punch 
[00:27:00]  in the numbers our product that we're asking you to pay monthly for it's so good that we assume  you don't listen no as a company you gotta have more confidence and just assume they might be  listening you sure you're listening we can't afford to sacrifice that kind of bandwidth if we don't  know you're listening it could be best used to somebody that's actually changing the stations  every 10 minutes like netflix allows you at least three episodes automatically before it says are you  still watching this you click okay then it goes another yeah yeah a little pop-up comes up you're 
[00:27:30]  not still listening are you yeah can't possibly can't possibly be switched to something else by now  right have confidence in your product yeah they're listening relax right shit so art bow by the way i'm  looking at his twitter he was i was only here a month and a half he already was tweeting about shows  he was missing like he was already taking shows off really one show he took off because he said the  studio in dc was down so no phone lines no show he just said fuck that i ain't doing a show that's 
[00:28:00]  great and then like a week ago he tweeted uh there will be no show tonight my back locked up and i hit  the floor like a sack of webs but he can't blame serious for that wait what happened his back locked up  so he canceled the show oh man i'm adding that to mike's that is a good one hey my back locked up  right back this morning that's beautiful and the other thing uh this uh richie incognito thing  i i i the the twitter people they just gotta stop they just gotta stop we gotta stop right 
[00:28:30]  because we didn't have all the info yesterday no we didn't remember when we talked about this  yesterday we're like look i i even begged i'm like anyone please call and give me  info because this seems really strange and weird to me it was breaking news and all we had yesterday  was like that you know he had to pay uh that the dude that he was being that was being bullied had  to pay for i don't know a three hundred thousand dollar dinner remember that from yesterday and a trip 
[00:29:00]  to vegas and this and that so we're like well okay that's some hazing shit it sucks but you got to  deal with that and then we learned that he's you know he's not a rookie anymore and they still treat  him like shit right so we were kind of we were kind of like leaning toward the fact that the guy  was being a fucking baby and that he should just deal with it and suck it up and eventually it'll be  over because we didn't have all the info so people attacked oh you still you think he's a baby really  he was called the half nigger and i write the guy back i'm like we didn't have that info yesterday 
[00:29:30]  well when not enough people called up to give us the story we all should have left the company  well that too right we should have just left but we didn't have all that info no and can't you  fucking figure that shit out in your own brain is that what he called him yeah jesus yeah on voicemail  on voicemail see how you just said that's what he called him yeah yeah we didn't have this yesterday  didn't have that you're still supporting the bully i'm like obviously not but yesterday yeah we kind 
[00:30:00]  of were because we didn't have all the info because there's now uh there's voicemails and now  there's a video of him in a bar with with his shirt off just yelling and screaming and dropping  n-bombs and dropping n-bombs really he dropped one oh i gotta what's the headline look at the  head what a big oaf he is look at that i can relate to this guy less richie incognito drops the  n-bomb and acts like a psycho i can relate to acts like a psycho is there is there audio of him 
[00:30:30]  with the telemarketer is that what it is is that what he's being the psycho is  oh man crack cocaine with a crack i think the most amazing thing is his last name really incognito  yeah that was an amazing last name i was i was trying to fool fool around with a wordplay joke  and then decided to fucking yeah just try i decided to not go for it but wow that's kind of a wicked  name but it's not it's something we've talked about the last name always works out in some strange 
[00:31:00]  way incognito yeah so i mean now that we got more info i i don't support him you can't support a guy  that's a complete and utter lunatic is he that crazy they yeah i mean more coming out that you  know he had a problem when he was on the chargers okay and that this was his like his kind of second  chance to get his shit together with the dolphins they kind of gave him a chance and uh you know he  kind of blew it and the dolphins are now saying he'll never play it for them again wow really he's 
[00:31:30]  done the nfl is starting to hint that he might get a lifetime ban yeah yeah suspended indefinitely  by the dolphins on sunday okay uh he allegedly left martin a voicemail in 2013 calling him a half  nigger piece of shit wow and saying he wants to shit in his mouth he went he went on to say fuck  you you're still a rookie i'll kill you oh man we did not have this info yesterday violence to the 
[00:32:00]  people that were attacking me you're supporting the bully yeah uh he also called marna a half  half again uh in text messages the nfl has heard the voicemail and seen the text messages and have  had upper level meetings on the case he also made reference to tracking down members of martin's  family and harming them gee incognito also reportedly got martin to contribute fifteen thousand dollars to  help finance a trip to las vegas that's the info we had yesterday for several dolphins players even 
[00:32:30]  though martin opted not to travel with the group instead martin allegedly gave incognito the fifteen  thousand dollars because he feared the consequences of what would happen if he did it and yesterday  we had that info and really just thought you know it's some hazing shit that'll get over it sure  so uh incognito voted dirtiest player in the nfl in 2009 2002 incognito bullied a teammate so badly 
[00:33:00]  that the teammate left football practice while he was a freshman at nebraska he allegedly plowed into  lineman jack uh limbaugh's back during practice for no apparent reason uh he's been ejected from  games for fighting that happens a bunch though right you want an animal like this on your team though  don't you yeah i think so not when he's doing it to his teammates yeah maybe that's not good uh the  rams oh i said the charges i apologize fuck it was the rams uh the rams gave up on him after he  headbutted two opponents in 2009 he committed 39 penalties with the rams in four seasons the bills 
[00:33:30]  then claimed him but dumped him after three games so wow uh i did not know that this guy was kind of  a problem over the years yeah of course i i i'll speak for myself i don't yeah i don't i can't support  the guy of course not do we have audio of him uh saying these horrible things uh we don't have the  voicemail but we do have uh him acting like a maniac in a bar shirtless i'd like to um this kind of  made me laugh yeah sure tmz gets all he seems like he's a bit drunk and he's just kind of 
[00:34:00]  ranting and raving and moving around the bar without a shirt yeah his shirt's off he's got the big  fucking i don't bruiser barrel body but i don't understand what kind of bar this is because  then they kind of panned the the bar and there's other guy shirtless what the fuck's going on well  what'd he say there he said mike pouncey nigga oh but why are they saying this is shocking 
[00:34:30]  yeah well because now he he i hear him using that word in a in a friendly way of course he's being  but in the context of he also did that thing right now they have him using the n-word in any context  and they got but look at tmz's headline they made this sound like shocking like he was calling  someone right there is a big difference he's celebrating yeah yeah like i'll be home and go 
[00:35:00]  like yo where's the remote nigga like just shit like that it's not shocking it's not shocking silly  it's not in context of hate speech no you just like yo you know that's what he's doing right there i  mean obviously he has other instances where he is using it in a very offensive manner right but  that's just him being an asshole right here there's nothing really not even being an asshole he's just  kind of i mean just being a dude seems like he's under the influence a little bit he's just having a  good time oh yeah 
[00:35:30]  oh he's a problem look at him he's just bouncing around the bar he just kicked a billiards table oh  yeah they're all kind of laughing at him  you're the best man at my wedding 
[00:36:00]  imagine he wants to fight you at a bar oh he's a problem  he's a fucking problem wow but i mean  running around the place kicking pool tables well what was going on in that bar that day 
[00:36:30]  it looks like some kind of little party yeah they're not even really explaining the video  no no out of context seems like he had he's had a few he took his shirt off and he's just kind of  bouncing around a bit yeah yeah i don't think anyone felt uh threatened there look at the tmz  with go down drops n-bomb on video in crazy bar rage no it's just a douchebag that you've seen get  that jock douchebag very good time yeah that's what he is they're fun and they dropped the n-bomb 
[00:37:00]  in kind of a in a different context yeah absolutely there's a lot of people would like to have you  believe that there is no context for that word but there is there is the offensive calling somebody  uh and then there is the using it like just fucking you know yeah there's a there's a black  high school in my neighborhood oh shit what are your taxes jesus christ and you know 
[00:37:30]  you know we and most of us uh you know locals understand from three to five it's best to kind  of oh you can hunker down you hunker down hunker down just to school that's out yeah you know what  are you gonna do and being as white as i am it's a bit intimidating oh you got it you know i don't see  any i don't see anything going down yeah to be completely fair sure but i'm not you know completely  stupid yeah you know i see some things maybe not like you do but head on a swivel during those 
[00:38:00]  times a little bit on a swivel but i and i swear to you the amount of times i hear that word between  three and five it is it is unbelievable yes in a sentence that word is being used way more than any  other word any other word and then if you watch any world star hip-hop videos but it's every other  word in a sentence yes absolutely it seems exhausting to say the word that many times in one sentence 
[00:38:30]  but you just walk around and that's all you hear the kids are just they throw that around  to them i i just don't believe they think that word is powerful is offensive all right i just don't  believe it you say it too much for it to be offensive if anyone is saying it right it's not  that big a deal because it's being used so much but but but i i think it's an excuse to but we hear  from that we hear from the you know the black people that are about our age and it's obviously 
[00:39:00]  different to them they've tried to explain that to us but but for the youth there's no fucking way it  has the same meaning when you just pepper your language like that yeah all day long there's no  way it's like you could you could be walking down the street and say that but then you can't like if  you're at work and you get in the elevator and it's like yo hit lobby nigga right you know the people  in the elevator probably can be a little offended i'm trying down the street it's fine i gotta figure 
[00:39:30]  out how i can record it yeah i gotta i gotta just sit in an area and just push record because you  record me oh yeah that would be a problem so i gotta figure out how to do this be careful be  careful because i'm like there's no way yeah they pretty much laugh at that word yeah the young is  the youngins we use it as a joke too around the house at like parties and stuff you know  and even around my uh my black friends my black friend um no you had a couple over of course i saw 
[00:40:00]  some of the instagram videos you had a few very diverse party halloween party i had uh i think  it was three i had four black people at my house congratulations count them oh drew boogie  five oh yes including drew boogie that's five five and an eighth well four and yeah now it was five  i'm pointing towards sam oh oh you definitely have some black in you i don't give a fuck what the

[00:41:30]  we had a weird mall shooting overnight yeah this is just a weird thing that uh richard shoop i think  is his name shoop shoop shoopadoop it was i wonder if uh dennis falcone would play a shoop song he'd play  shoop you think he would well i didn't mean any harm by that hey a little mall shooting today but  we're we're gonna feel up and good about it by playing shoop let's ask him how he would spin  that shit is he around he should be yeah man by the name of shoop all right shot and killed himself 
[00:42:00]  in the mall all right we get before we go on the mall shooting i knew this was gonna happen which is  fine uh let's go to steve in chicago steve what's up how old are you steve okay uh i'm about i'm i'm in  my lower 20s you know around 20 25 black male in chicago that's 25 congrats why can't you give us  your age why does it have to be between 20 and 25 just say late 20s huh just late 20s wow 
[00:42:30]  wow that audio depressed me all day yesterday i'll explain a little later maybe uh steve all right so  you're in your your low to almost mid 20s yeah whatever and um you know i'm here in  deep in the heart of chyrak well i'm actually on the edge of gentrification there's a few white  people walking around and everything that's nice and and i just wanted to say like why do you guys  have to be so cliche when it comes to the n-word what do you mean like you guys are i mean like 
[00:43:00]  first of all we played a video of a hyper violent extra dangerous white guy going crazy in a bar  screaming the n-word you guys rationalizing it like it's um it's really disturbing hold on did you see  the video because it's laughable no one was scared in that bar if he's if no one was scared in that bar  of this guy they they thought he was a goofball again there is a context to it if he was going up to 
[00:43:30]  a black guy and yelling that in his face that's different that's a problem just going around the  bar going yeah i'm partying nigga you know as a black dude that's been in chicago that's been  witness to plenty of white guys going crazy like that oh stop there's more black guys going crazy  blurting that blurting that word out blurting that word out every other word every other word  out of black guys mouths or nigger and and and and and in chicago it's a lot it's 99 black guys 
[00:44:00]  hurting other black people it's not it's not dangerous white guys in chicago killing uh black  people stop it first of all you need to calm down i am but you're talking over me calm down dog i'm  trying to talk i don't like you calling me dog nigga oh okay i don't like you calling me nigga uh  dog what it's just a friendly thing black people call each other that all the time i'm just trying 
[00:44:30]  to dude you're not being friendly i'm just trying to be i'm just trying to be fucking friendly  i'm using the vernacular i'm using the urban vernacular no dude i'm in i'm in an urban environment  black people really only say the n-word to each other when they're you know trying to like  highlight that you know there's some dumb shit going down no it isn't it's every other word  in conversation stop it um but i think that's really out of vogue what i'm trying to say is this 
[00:45:00]  look you're being really really really typical when you are trying to rationalize i'm not being  typical because most white people are scared shitless to say that oh no no dude it's 2013 i just got  done is it 2013 and everybody was in blackface like it wasn't a big deal everybody was in blackface  this guy is so fucking where was everyone in blackface where was everyone in blackface  if it was chicago because they're probably real black people what are you talking about 
[00:45:30]  no it's not even it's not even worth debating because like we just see completely different  ways i i'm just telling you my experience when i walk around my neighborhood when the high school  gets out every single kid is throwing that word around like it's nothing but he'll tell you my my  point would be if the word is so powerful and such a no-no then why why is why do every  almost every black kid i see in the neighborhood just throw it around like that like it's no big deal 
[00:46:00]  comment what you're doing what you're doing is you may see one or two and you think oh my god  i swear to you that's not the case i swear to you people in the black community use that word  like it's going out of style i'm trying to talk to open open what i'm saying i've been fucking  i've been chastised i'll embrace this one i like him  you are one of the most disgusting kind of races you just got done telling us that you're scared 
[00:46:30]  shitless to go outside at a certain point in time when all the black did you say you're scared  shitless steve you didn't say oh you didn't say he was steve steve this show is based on hopefully  comedy and humor i didn't actually mean that okay i did that i did not actually mean that that was a  dumb maybe some people laughed probably not it was a dumb attempt at a joke you know it conjures up  an image scary white you know us scared white people were in our homes with the shades down 
[00:47:00]  waiting for the high school kids to go home conjures it it was so obviously it was it was a joke opi's  hiding behind trash cans right trying to get home the fact is i i you know people around here beg me  not to do it i take bike rides through harlem during the day because because it's fascinating up  there in one instance yeah one thing every black person is dropping the n-word like the word duh  and then in another instance white people are scared shit yeah that part wasn't a joke by the 
[00:47:30]  way i do i do i do hear that word a lot every single day black people use the word nigga  a lot my friend dude are you sure yes positive positive of it my experience yes i'd be willing  to bet large amounts of money affiliated with you are not affiliated with young black people at all  yeah okay all right i know nothing i think i know nothing i think you're in denial if you if you think  that you're so special young young black people are are not using that word a lot you're crazy 
[00:48:00]  i think you're in denial dude i really do white people and you're in denial if you think that white  people using it is a-okay which it is in certain contexts i think it is fine i think if one group  of people use a word then another group of people should be exactly same word there's no course there's  no i don't believe there's a divide in language whatsoever i absolutely don't believe that do i  personally use the word not really i i said it today for the first time in a long time because it's in a 
[00:48:30]  in a huge news story i i choose not to use that word usually yeah in the way that it was intended  to be used and it shook me to my core i i use it i use it around the house sometimes if i'm like uh  we're hanging out with friends and i'll be like i'll be like uh somebody comes in i'll be like  yeah nigga and it's kind of fun it's kind of fun and you i know i know the kind of characters you  hang out with you do yeah how do you know just by listening to the yeah how do you know i don't 
[00:49:00]  know anything about young black people but you know the kind of people i hang out with the one  thing you are the biggest you are one of the biggest fucking hypocrites you're the exact type  of people that make it so so that your entire community cannot assimilate to uh uh american society  because of dumb fucks like you hold on dumb fuck hypocrites like you hold on hold on i'm going to  put you on with a teacher are you willing to listen to a teacher by the way every phone line is lit and 
[00:49:30]  they're all on our side going this absolutely happens oh could we give some to art bell but i guess  we have a come on let's help him out let's go to matt in new york who teaches ufo question where do you  teach high school matt i teach on the i'm on the island so i have friendwood they use it  in other words i've been called it and i am the typical middle-aged jewish guy you're ever going  to want to meet oh so a jewish teacher is called it what what high school what's the makeup of the 
[00:50:00]  students there it's um you're acting in certain ways i would say a quarter or two i'm just saying  25 25 25 25 black all right about a quarter um um a lot of yes oh and by the way what's your name  sir wait a second what's your name sir it's not going to give his name yeah man by the way uh i  should say that there are white kids saying the same word around the black kids as well yeah  you can dude you can say a lot of white kids actually say yes just never okay i'm telling you 
[00:50:30]  well it's never okay shut up it is too it is too okay then talk to you stop with this taboo  fucking word bullshit i'm sick of it everyone's sick everyone's sick of it don't say it the end  we're shut up my in certain context it's fine for a goddamn nun to use it my my point is is simple  if the if the word truly is not okay then you got to tell your peers to stop right throwing the 
[00:51:00]  word around like it's nothing because it's losing its power no no trust me there's no power behind  it but it's just wrong why why is it wrong why is it wrong because because it's wrong why give me a  fucking reason why why why a slave and tell me shut up with your 200 year old bullshit for a fucking word  you don't even know slavery so shut up your father didn't know slavery your grandfather didn't know 
[00:51:30]  slavery his father didn't know slavery so shut the fuck up with slavery god damn enough with that  fucking excuse shut it reality is things are not fair things are not right in the same city where  you're so scared to walk outside i'm not scared i already explained that you did steve i explained  that i'm not actually scared it was a dumb fucking attempt at humor oh god with this slavery shit 
[00:52:00]  let me say hi to not in dc who's on with steve in chicago go ahead todd even i'd like to ask you a  question i'm a middle-aged white man government employee um if your own word is so uh powerful  he's not unemployed he said he's a government employee used in this in society in black society 
[00:52:30]  what what what what's going on in black society  hello i love that what is the what's the question yeah if this word is so powerful i'd like to ask you  why it is continued to be used in society um racism is powerful i'm sorry racism is powerful  why is it why is it mostly black people using the word i doubt that you doubt that shut the 
[00:53:00]  fuck now you're talking you're talking about your fucking ass you're delusional going up with the n  word i'm i'm offended shut up what a fucking delusional he's not being honest man he's not  being honest he's being a fucking you're just blatantly lying now if you think white people are  using the word nigga more than black people you're fucking out of your mind out of your mind 
[00:53:30]  in 2013 it's been a crazy year we just watched we just watched a white jury let a man go for killing  a yeah for for self-defense we watched the jury let a man go for self-defense yeah and and and  and a man that was being beaten a man that was being beaten shot another fucking man uh and killed him  and and a jury a jury found him innocent so shut up look look that was that was a miscarriage of 
[00:54:00]  justice no it wasn't not seen in public yeah yeah and if and and if you were having your face if you  were having your face beat in i think you'd have a different uh take on the whole thing another  hypocrisy another hypocrisy based solely on race if if it was the other way around you would  completely support the shooter shut up you're basing everything in your life on race get the fuck  over it jump in and join the big team the u.s of a no look

[00:56:00]  talking to right there because he works for the government obviously what the fuck does he know  where in urban areas tony is how you sound first off look at how you sound  will you let tony speak for one second tony tony tony what's your point what's your point  first off i'm just saying man i i'm a 90s kid i grew up in that shit too well everybody  says nigger like it's nothing man i'm mexican i heard that shit my entire life of white people 
[00:56:30]  and they all agree with that shit hey could you stop talking for a second this isn't a movie theater  that's what i did there you see the only bad thing about it is when you say nigger that  fucking takes it a little too far but when you say like oh at the end of it look at how you sound man  you sound like a white guy trying to be black shut your fucking ass up already you're a fucking  joke dude you don't know nothing about what's dead in the fucking street you work in the government 
[00:57:00]  bro where do you that's it most of the people here today yeah you urkel ass motherfucker  all right tony you got george zimmerman on the line trying to all right george zimmerman all right well  uh get over it in the time in the do you know there's been over 10 000 black people killed by  other black people in this in the time since george zimmerman got off for self-defense do you even  understand that but you don't care you don't care about that you'd like to think there's this giant 
[00:57:30]  problem of white on black violence that doesn't even fucking exist okay you i know that same  trite point trite point it's called a fact it's called a fact there's a huge problem of black on  black violence why don't you delve into that can you can you can you can you shut up for a second  how about you shut up for a second no fuck you you shut up for a second you're yapping over everybody  you're yapping yapping over everybody anthony what okay so you're trying to use the same argument 
[00:58:00]  about the n-word when it comes to killing black kids in the street no i they're two different  they're two different points i was i was addressing two different points two different points  to kill black people in the street it's not okay for any black person to die in the street it's not  okay for anybody to die in the street ten over ten thousand over ten thousand what's going on is a 
[00:58:30]  tragedy but when you go down there and then you see how it's being handled how it's being dealt with  how how the right right because it's somebody else's fault right because it's always someone  else's fault it's always some other reason aside from the fact that there is no civility  no fucking uh family structure family structure i'm sorry hey uh steve could you explain something  because you seem to be in the know i'm going to play something for you and you just explain it to me 
[00:59:00]  okay all right listen all right please  oh  that's 30 seconds of a very popular song seriously that's 30 seconds and it was probably 
[00:59:30]  said uh 12 to 15 times in the first 30 seconds of the song so you explain to me why that is such a  horrendous word now you like that don't you i'm not saying i like it but it's a very popular song  it has 18 and a half million views on youtube okay so now you explain to me why that word is such a bad 
[01:00:00]  word there now it's being thrown around like that in pop culture now no one's going to talk over you  so now go please make your point racism is wrong i don't know why you're what do you say racism is  racism is wrong no no i honestly but this goes to my point if it's such a powerful word why is it just  thrown around in pop culture why is it being thrown around when uh black kids are just walking  around with their friends it's a preferred word it's not even like it's being thrown around and 
[01:00:30]  people are like on i don't want to have to use this but i'm going to use it it's a preferred word to use  in the urban community there's a lot of young people that just love that word right and they say  like it's nothing do you know more black people use the word than white supremacists more black  people use the word than white supremacists do all right let's listen you're out of your mind  let's listen to the next 30 seconds of this song the next 30  this rap shit cracking i love my niggas you're looking for some rain let me call my niggas 
[01:01:00]  he's selling for the i need all my niggas some niggas smoke smoke some niggas drink  niggas on the block would drink like they don't think  get some bottles up in this motherfucker let's stop popping bottles  yeah  all right that's another like 12 uh times the word is used  and we're not even a minute into the song are you looking to will wayne to justify your  that's yg son that's yg motherfucker i'm saying this i'm saying this 
[01:01:30]  wow look we can pick a bunch of these songs by the way this is just the you know one of them  i do there's a ton of songs so why that's so why why is this okay why is this okay go  i never said it was well uh you know what then you're in the minority  you're a minority of the minority you're in the minority because uh it's a very popular song  no one's no one no one are you seriously this racist to think that i speak for every single 
[01:02:00]  black person no but but you really aren't even close what i'm telling you is this yeah you know  it's wrong and you feel a certain no don't try to tell me that i feel this guilt that it's wrong  you're not finding an ounce of white guilt in me motherfucker not an ounce i love it  all right well i'm sorry you do you know no i don't i use i use the word i use the word and i don't 
[01:02:30]  care i don't give a fuck right and i'm racist ow ow i wear it like a badge when people call me  racist like a badge because i don't care because i know the real me motherfucker  uh i'm glad that you i'm glad that you expose it all right well i don't expose it you think you  think you know what i'm about you think i'm racist and i'm not going to sit there and argue i'm not  going to argue with people that i'm not racist why would i do that why would i fucking do that i 
[01:03:00]  know what i am and and the best way to deflect an argument is to call someone racist and then have  them stammering trying to explain why they're not a racist and it deflects from the actual conversation  fuck you i ain't playing it okay so maybe maybe uh maybe you know playing that song is a little over  the top so now i go to something else that's pretty popular these days in pop culture and that  would be twitter so i all right i just put uh n-i-g-g-a in the search oh boy there's over a 
[01:03:30]  hundred tweets that have come in in the last minute alone using that using that word oh and i bet if  you look at the profiles of the people using it it's all white people right well there's wait a  second so everybody on the internet is exactly who they know it's a great sample it's a great way to  take a quick sample of something right and and and if well it here's here's one last night i was  singing uh made to be together and i thought jay was sleep when the chorus came on this nigga came 
[01:04:00]  out to cut singing oh yeah that's a white guy any uh nigga out here getting this illegal money like  this shit is right i salute you my nigga these are all that came in the last minute alone won't trust  the nigga that's why i wake up say my prayers and be like fucking nigga and argue people change when  they get into relationship they forget who was there before the nigga these are black people's  tweets dude they're black people's tweets and yes yes i'm absolutely positive i'm just stop it 
[01:04:30]  just do it yourself put the word in twitter it is being thrown around like it's nothing and that's  my point today i don't know the makeup of any of these people but i could tell you this much  every time you hit refresh there's another hundred that come in right it's pretty much being tweeted a  hundred times every single minute yeah it's all white people pretending to be black would you stop it  would you stop it you're like you're either you're either you're either stupid lying to yourself 
[01:05:00]  or completely delusional what are you are you delusional lying to yourself or a fucking moron what are you  what a fucking moron yeah a fucking moron you you can't see you can't see shit that's right in front of  your face you're blinded by race you're blinded by your own race you're blinded by your own race  you have a racist tv show a racist radio show which yeah that's what it is  that's what it is well of course point that you've been reciting since the 1970s since you 
[01:05:30]  were knocking in you what in the 70s wow how old are you the only tin i was knocking in the 70s was  an erector set i believe right you're disgusting you're disgusting there wow all right we showed each  other and so we showed each other there let's end it there because you both uh called each other  disgusting i think that's let's just let's just agree to hate each other you're not off the hook  either oh powering you you will be cowering later this afternoon no i really i know you will be 
[01:06:00]  cowering later this afternoon see i've been around long enough to understand what you're trying to do  there but i already i already explained myself so you can continue down that road if you like but  i already told you i was just going for a dumb little joke and that was it okay all right go out  go be the joke of the community go ahead you be the joke of the community thanks for your time go  out and be the guy that uh everyone laughs at go ahead time my point was extremely simple today 
[01:06:30]  drew can't make a song out of that and no one could explain this to to myself yeah like if the word is  being thrown around that easily right what is the issue with the word these days exactly it confuses me  and i want someone to just explain that right there explain that because it seems a bit hypocritical  is all i'm saying i personally don't like using the word it's one of the biggest hypocrisies in  society by the way it's like a bit hypocritical it's look at one of the biggest hypocrisies in today's 
[01:07:00]  society i keep refreshing yeah with that search and i can't keep up with it you can't it's unbelievable  how many times it's being tweeted every single minute the word and this guy thinks like like  white people are using it in a greater instance than black people and he's insane and we've talked  to you know older black guys and they say yeah it's not okay and they get frustrated by the fact that  you know um the youth of today you know just throw it around like that i've i i heard those guys 
[01:07:30]  loud and clear when they called yep jesus holy mother of god how many uh how many times is the  word used in uh yg song i mean it's a hook it's got to be hundreds a song you think they'd have it in  there a hundred times we can count i guess but that song's pretty fly yo have somebody count real fast  outside the studio oh man but it's amazing look i just i just refreshed again again and it's just 
[01:08:00]  hundreds of times per instance about a hundred times every minute on twitter yeah and if you go  to the profile like that guy was talking out his ass of course if you go to the profiles on twitter  it's obvious these are black people it's obvious a majority black but then also there's definitely  some uh white white kids yeah but not there's a white broad but not in a detrimental way they're  using it in in a way like oh of course they're just you know honestly as i go through this i don't  really i don't really see it being used in a hateful way right in general exactly in general i'm sure i 
[01:08:30]  could find a few that's the big point but as i scroll here it's just all being used like it's you  know yeah it's just a way to way to describe oneself it's an exclamation it's yeah a way to describe  oneself it's um it's it's just a way to this nigga mixtape goes hard this guy writes yeah i don't see  any hate there as he uses the word  it's absolutely a power tool that's used in a community that feels a bit powerless that's what 
[01:09:00]  it is and and and and to say that white people can't use it is just a it's a childish way to be  like oh look we finally have something to hold over your head and i i'm not buying that it's  bullshit baby shit yeah do it yourself if you want throw the word right and you'll see you don't like 
[01:09:30]  it uh then don't use it you can't tell a group of people they can't you can't you shut up fucking  infantile even coming up with that uh argument all right now all right hold on sam go to  this guy writes i like the youtube video yeah uh and then it's the link and then it says nigga birds  i gotta know what this is just update on the song yeah i'm a minute and 46 uh it's a yg song right 
[01:10:00]  into yg song and there's a 60 uses of the word so far 60 and it's not even half over no it's not  half over so we can assume there's more than 120 can you put the instances nigga n-i-g-g-a bird  on youtube birds in in youtube i have no idea what this is it just it just caught my attention 
[01:10:30]  this could be a dead end there's um hmm it's there it's that cartoon yes oh okay looks like angry  birds look at them nigga birds them eggs though and i'ma get those eggs buzz buzz buzz buzz oh look  a nice place to poop this motherfucker they're doing like an angry birds uh parody all right like i said  you know sometimes we have dead ends i love when people do that i do dance you gotta see this i'll 
[01:11:00]  click the link and be like do you even listen to the show and know that this is dumb that was just  stupid just stupid hey wow man what the yeah what the hell's going on i don't know  so look it's incendiary these this argument so the garden state plaza mall oh yeah we got a guy  a 20 year old kid richard shoop shoop goes in there some say you know he had armor on others saying it 
[01:11:30]  was a black leather jacket some saying he had a helmet on yeah it seemed to be a bicycle helmet  or something and just a jacket when he would walk toward nordstrom's and he started firing in the  air i guess and yeah he fired some shots in the air he said to people that uh don't worry i'm not  gonna hurt you i'm not gonna hurt you i just want to get out of here yeah something like that said i  guess and then he he got out of there shot out some security cameras and then uh swat team and  everybody you know he went to the mall there yeah and then they uh they found him dead in the basement 
[01:12:00]  or something yeah yeah some basement area self-afflicted gunshot wound the guy he got himself  yeah i left a note so i'm sure we'll we'll hear more yeah later today dennis gentlemen hey would  you play a shoop would you play a shoop song for richard shoop you pull all the songs that have  anything to do with that that is the dumbest thing ever pull the song why because you're being 
[01:12:30]  insensitive all the songs i want to be insensitive it's the stupidest thing ever oh boy no shoop songs  today the only the only time i almost agree with it was uh 9 11 obviously right but besides that is  the dumbest thing when they start pulling songs as they think they're insensitive all of a sudden  yeah gotta put the safe list out no uh no shotgun shoot him for he run now junior walker and the  all-stars motown so a program director actually goes and just takes all the songs out depending on the 
[01:13:00]  the big event that went down yeah i remember if uh if there's ever a plane crash god forbid you  make sure you go through the commercial log and pull all the uh you know airline commercials  well yeah why uh you just do you just very insensitive up and you pull up up and away by  fifth dimension oh would you play this no no you didn't play this why oh man no well i wouldn't play  this version i played the hit version by uh peter paul and mary number one hit music from 1969 
[01:13:30]  is this john denver john denver he wrote the song though yeah isn't that ironic wait john denver  wrote that song yeah and that's how he went out yeah he went out in a plane yeah so did jim croce  another great uh singer songwriter yeah we know that jim croce died of course but why would you have  to pull all those songs uh you do because if it's insensitive it mentions uh shootings or something  for guns from mr miscarriage over here for the listener oh man for the listener i never understood 
[01:14:00]  that like i said 9 11 right yeah of course it's a little different i mean that was an over-the-top  ridiculous big event but so you wouldn't play janey's got a gun no oh no bang bang by share  bang bang no huh no you can't do that you can't you can't do songs like that it's very insensitive  you have to be more sensitive oh so here's a little dedication to the uh jersey mall gunman 
[01:14:30]  you wouldn't do that no no no it's insensitive yeah for who though for the listener for people  for you know for the for the victims the family of the victims but are they're not listening  but they'll you know they can find out about it they get some things it's always interesting you  know he's got a request here could i uh could i request that he ain't heavy he's my brother my  uncle just died an hour ago people feel compelled to call a radio station right that's terrible yeah  but i guess that's their escape and that's the relief because as a disc jockey you're their friend 
[01:15:00]  on the radio you're their friend you don't want to reach out and make them feel bad no no no you  make them feel good you want to try to connect right right i don't know i think it's kind of an  over-the-top reaction it really is an over-the-top reaction i mean i think if it's an event that  affects a lot of people locally yeah okay i get it i remember in 1963 when president john f kennedy  was assassinated the radio stations just were very somber just very even music radio but at that point 
[01:15:30]  you kind of want some upbeat stuff really yeah it's a little somber i don't i've never you wouldn't play  like bang your head on that day well even though it wasn't written you had it recorded no no nothing  like that right no you wouldn't you try to uh you know you try yeah yeah give me back my bullets  something like that you want to play that no what about andrea yates would you play a splish splash i  was taken a bet was that her or was that the one at the lake can i always get those two confused can  we talk about the somber thing for a little bit okay so all right president kennedy gets shot and all 
[01:16:00]  the radio stations go somber but at that point when you want some kind of uplifting ring up a little  music because everyone is so bummed out right and then if you want to be a somber asshole then guess  what then you don't listen to the radio station that day no i mean it's still there like i never  understood you go to a wake and and you know it's someone you obviously love dearly and it's already  a somber sad thing and then they bring all the music down to a point like let's make you sadder here 
[01:16:30]  today terrible and i'm not saying you you throw on some fucking dance song but it seems like you  could do something in between well don't the irish folks uh do something after a wake don't they  usually have well an irish way they have a little you know exactly well i think that makes it makes  the most sense because you always they should be doing that at the funeral parlor having the wake  having the wake and having a little bit of a party well some of them you know maybe bring a little  flask yeah you go in the back oh you want to take a maybe a little nip maybe i could pick up some 
[01:17:00]  business you know yeah yeah a little sip of courage yeah ah sip of courage but why do we do that as  humans i guess we're somber and sad so let's make ourselves more somber and more sad oh i hate that  yeah i guess that's just the way it's always been  oh this is terrible is this any they used to play this all the time after 9-11 this was on every  station oh what happened on uh 9-11 some uh september 11th oh oh yeah i don't understand i don't 
[01:17:30]  understand the purpose of this i really don't why be sad no i mean it's okay to be sad that's not my  point i mean why why make it extra sad yeah yes yeah humans have that emotion to be sad extra sad  and then we as humans decide no i don't i think you need to be sadder so we're gonna put some  menu on the radio and hoping that everyone will be just fucking crying their eyes out as they drive  around new york well in this day and age people also have a lot of other different places to go so 
[01:18:00]  if uh you know they feel that uh what are you talking about they might listen to their ipod or  something with songs that make them uplifting where they might go online or they just might do  so you're saying the dj doesn't have the the important role he used to have well it's been  it's been watered down because there's so many more places it was always watered down so many more  places to go that's where we're going to continue to butt heads but you're still they were never  friends yeah but you could listen to your ipod all you want you still can't get that personality 
[01:18:30]  between the song people don't really listen to their ipod i want a personality you got an ipod  who has an ipod anymore spotify motherfucker so yeah just on the phone i just switched over from  a walkman i don't even know why we call our phones phones anymore there's just no other word for it  right it's like oh i have my phone what md multi-device how about that yeah multi-device  it's also a muscular dystrophy why do we want to multi-device bad suggestion so what do you listen 
[01:19:00]  to up when you're back at your crib oh wow that was good those those aircats are good no i'm not  no that's all i want from you just fight back that's good stuff that's a good job yeah that's  fun that audio really really hurt my soul yesterday that's so funny we didn't discuss that for like 10-15  minutes before the show well don't you go home and listening back to your air checks don't never  you know not since um do that really you don't have air check parties no i used to i used to no

[01:20:00]  we know when i was coming up the business assessing yeah i would listen a lot to my air checks on the  way home and stuff and like pick up on stuff yes good it's good not so much these days well you know  you know you could always learn and you could always grow  yeah  hello  Fuck you, Iraq 
[01:20:30]  Oh, fucking Iraq  Uh-oh  This is how Iraq gets me back, by the way  With STP  We don't go toe-to-toe  This is his way of getting me back  You can't go toe-to-toe with Iraq  True  Never reach him  I know, the bellies would fight first  We all figured it out  Alright, Dennis, terrific  Anything else going on?

[01:28:30]  I'm voting for  Ed Mangano  Do the same please  Because  I don't like  Tax and spend Democrats  My taxes are high enough  And I don't want to  Go through that Swazi again  I'm voting for de Blasio  Because he's a regular guy  Just like me  Well he's a picture  There's a picture of him in the paper  This must have been with Swade  You're right up  Yeah yeah  He's a regular guy  He's doing his own laundry  He's got this big laundry bag  Over his shoulder  As he's walking to the laundromat  Yuck  Or something  Some asshole around him 
[01:29:00]  Said hey man  Perfect photo op  Day before the election  Where you get a picture  Of you doing your own laundry  Get the fuck out of here  Stop it  Everyone just lies  Everyone  Just a bunch of bullshitters  All over the place  I'm stunned that it  Looks like it's going to be  A landslide here  For de Blasio  No one's really looking at this  And saying  Wow  We've had these  Pretty  I don't know  Republican-y  Conservative-y 
[01:29:30]  Kind of tough on crime  Mayors  In New York City  It's done the city  Very well  If you look back  Before Giuliani got in  The city was a fucking disaster  And between Giuliani  And Bloomberg  We've had our problems  With Bloomberg  His personal ideology  Kind of slips in  A little too often  Into his policy  But for the most part  He's been very good  For revenue  For New York  And business  Very business friendly  Very tough on crime  He's been very supportive  Of the NYPD 
[01:30:00]  And it's made  New York City  Kind of a very safe  Tourist destination  That people like to come to  And now you're getting  De Blasio  Whose whole philosophy  Is the opposite of that  Big business  Are bad people  He's very  I'm going to just say  Communist  He loves communism  Oh my god  And he does not like  The NYPD  He does not like  Being tough on crime  He's a bleeding heart liberal 
[01:30:30]  To the point of being  Either socialist  Or commie  Oh he loved  The fucking  Sandinistas  And he honeymooned  In Cuba  He took a trip  Over there  To the Soviet Union  During the height  Of the Cold War  Cuba  Really?

We rectified this yesterday  I said

[01:33:30]  Yeah  When it's at the cost  Of social interaction  Right  When you're telling pregnant women  About stillbirth  And things  Maybe less preparation  A little more  Figuring out what  You should say to people  A little more social skills  Yeah  Interactions with peers  Yes  On a social level  Right  Alright Dennis Falcone  Dennis Falcone  Take care gentlemen  Take care  Have a lovely day  Enjoy the rest of your day  Here at Sirius XM Saturday Radio  Enjoy your two for Tuesday  Oh yeah  It's Tuesday isn't it

[01:48:00]  They ever earn anything  So a few years ago  We had an idea  For a massive prank  That parents could pull  On their children  I asked parents  To pretend they ate  All their kids  Halloween candy  Record video  Of their child's reaction  And uploaded to YouTube  With the title  Hey Jimmy Kimmel  I told my kids  I ate all their  Halloween candy  Why would a parent do that?  I know  Because Jimmy told them  We got an avalanche  Of great responses  It took us the whole weekend  To go through them  But we did  And we pieced together  Some of our favorites  And so without further ado  The candy monster  Strikes again

Let that shit defrost for a while  Keep the lid off  Oh, okay  And take the dry ice out of there  Yeah  Alright  Mmm  Let's mush him up a little bit  Oh, that's pretty goddamn good 
[01:59:00]  I'm still not gonna watch Grown Ups 2  I wish I had an edited version  Where it's all Colin Quinn's parts  I'd watch that  That's a tidy two minutes  Oh, really?  Yeah  They didn't give him a lot of time in that movie?  Grown Ups 2  Look, they were all jumping around  And the first one  They were going down the water slide  Oh, look, we're kids  Shut up  Looks like shit  Thanks for the ice cream sandwich, sucker  Right  Yeah, you should've sent shit sandwiches instead

[02:00:00]  Julius Irving  He's got a terrific book out  Mm  He's, uh  He's, uh  He's, uh  He's talking  What is he?  OB-GYN?  What kind of, uh, doctor?  Um  Cardiologist?  What do we got?  That's a very good question  He's not  Dr. J  He's not a Dr. Rang thing anymore  What?  Oh  Retired  Why did they call him Dr. J?  I should know the answer to this  I don't know  Um  Is it just kind of a, you know 
[02:00:30]  I don't like basketball  Cause on the court  I don't like basketball  It's like a doctor  Like a doctor?  Yeah  That's my answer  Cause on the court  He was like a doctor  That's the most ridiculous answer  What?  It makes sense  Oh  He surgically got around everyone  That's right  Oh, that's good  Oh  His finesse kind of  Dissected  The defense  Here's the answer  He got that shit done  It's not true  He's an actual doctor?  Yes  Doctor of basketballology  No, he, uh 
[02:01:00]  Called his buddy  The professor  Back in Roosevelt  Long Island  Because he was always  Very talkative  And argumentative  I like how they give  These fucking degrees  To each other  When they probably  Didn't even finish high school  What the fuck  I could have saved  50,000?  Right  All I had to do  Was call myself a doctor?  One day his friend  Returned the favor  And called him  And called him the doctor  Yeah  Because of the way  He could slice through defenses  And operate on his opponent  Wow  Wow  Yeah  Especially in a one-on-one situation 
[02:01:30]  Told you  Because he was a doctor  Damn  That's right  And you said it was ridiculous  Why not like  The abortionist Jay?  That would be good  Because he slices his opponents  Out of his way  He tried to have sex  With eight women  In eight days  I know that much  About the book  Wow  Did you see that?  He also choked out Larry Bird  By accident  Did you see the braces story?  Why he had a daughter?  What?  Did you see the story last week?  Like why he had a daughter? 
[02:02:00]  No  Is it in this article  That I gotta read still?  Uh  I don't know  Why did you?  Because the girl that he was with  Had braces  So she couldn't blow them  On her legs?  Yeah  Oh  Wait he admits this in the book?  Yeah  That's the only reason  Why he has a kid?  Yeah  So they had sex instead  Oh my god  Oh  How old was she with braces?  Ten  Oh my god  Iraq  Iraq  He was very irresponsible  With his seed  Unlike yourself  Right  Right  Dr. Nagel 
[02:02:30]  He kept his seed  Right  That's what  He was able to  Fucking dodge  Those fucking ovaries  Right  Dodge the fallopian tubes  Is that what they call it  Dr. Nagel?  Dr. Nagel  Dr. Nagel  You wouldn't  You wouldn't have  You know  Come in a girl  Just because  She couldn't blow you  Right?  No  Of course not  There's other holes  Oh  Jesus  I'm talking about anal sex  What an animal  Oh  The C-Roc's an animal  Dr. Nagel 
[02:03:00]  The proctologist  Dr. A  Dr. A  Ah  The ass man  The scary part is  He said there's other holes  When the mouth was off limits  Because of the braces  And he wouldn't go into the  Puh-ha  Right  The pussy  So what are the other holes?  There's one if I can count right  That's why I think  Yeah  I'm a little sick that he said holes  Okay  You know what I meant  Eric were you just trying to be cheeky?  How are the ice cream sandwiches? 
[02:03:30]  They're good  Pretty fucking righteous  Are they getting softer yet?  They are  I can barely bite into this one  Yeah  I got red velvet and chocolate chip  Cookies and cream here  Mmm  Pretty goddamn good  I want it all mushy  Where that  That wafer shit gets on your fingertips  If it gets too mushy though  With this type of thing  Where it's a thicker cookie  Than just that regular ice cream sandwich stuff  When you bite it  It squishes out the sides  So it's very difficult to eat  That type of ice cream sandwich 
[02:04:00]  I like your basic  Rectangular ice cream sandwich  But that shit gets on your fingertips  No the chipwitch  Love a chipwitch  What's that?  It comes off the sandwich part  And then you got it on your fingertips  If I was casting spells and stuff  And flying on a fucking broom  A chipwitch  Fuck  Hello  Wish chipwitch he had a laugh  Hello  Hello  Hello  Yeah  Yeah  Fucking dick  Fucking dick 
[02:04:30]  You know it right  Uh oh  Uh oh  I love it  Do ya  It's nostalgic  Is it?  It reminds me of days gone by  Yesterye  Yesterye  I guess the  Howard Stern party  Is not even on his actual birthday  No  Now I'm being told  He was born on January 12th 
[02:05:00]  But the company's thrown on the 31st  I don't remember that  Yeah they moved it  Why?  Two weeks after your birthday  It's like whatever  Time  Probably busy on the 12th  Yeah probably  Celebrating his birthday  Yeah  Yeah  Two week vacation  Right  This is more of an event  Uh  Thinks Ant  Needs to  Well let's say hi to Steve  And then we gotta go to break  Uh Steve  What's up buddy?

You know that Hugh  Hugh Pinero actually told me and Anthony that  Yeah  That we'd have a better perspective on life  If we had kids  And that we really need to have kids  You said that?  Oh he hated us  Yeah when he was yelling at me  One of the many times on the phone 
[02:06:00]  Fuck him  You know  I took the phone calls for us  Yeah  You're welcome  Fielding those  An hour of him screaming at me  On the phone  And one of the things he said was  You really  You guys need to get married  And have kids  Great thanks  I decided to get married  And have kids  Because I just wanted to  Not because  Hugh Pinero told me  Yeah  But Steve my perspective  I mean I would have been  Right there with Ant  Before I had kids  I would have been laughing my ass off  Yeah fine  But my kids  Anyone that has kids  They cry at the 
[02:06:30]  Dumbest stupidest things  I mean your perspective  Travis knows  Oh yeah  But it breaks your fucking heart  Not all the time  Yeah  Oh not anymore  Well your kid's a little older too right  Yeah but I mean  You know  Still breaks my heart  She's being whiny just to be whiny  Oh no no  The whiny shit  Travis won't have it  I've seen it too  Alright  Yeah knock it off  He's like  She's just being whiny  No don't confuse the issue  The whiny shit  I don't deal with either  Oh the crying  Yeah crying  Over just this  Like they just have no concept  Yes  I can relate  Because when I open that can of cat food

[02:07:30]  Yeah yeah  He cannot even understand why I would do that  Why?  Why?  You know little Beavis  He goes into the bathroom  And claws at the toilet paper roll  And it just flies off the roll  And he's just scratching it  And he doesn't understand  When I take it off the roll  And put it on the back of the toilet tank  That I'm saying  No Beavis  Don't do that  So I can understand  Exactly what it's like  You are right on point with Opie  Oh yeah yeah  You know  Alright guys man  Well you have a great day man  And I look forward to meeting your children one day

[02:20:00]  With the new husband  That's not the article  I  It was either in the daily news  Or the paper there  Whatever the fuck  It's called  Marina Oswald Porter  Does she  She calls herself Oswald  Yeah she kept Oswald  Why would you do that  She doesn't think  He killed him  So she's like  Fuck you  I won't do what you told me  Alright  I hear ya  Alright  That's kind of  In your face  Like yeah  I'm proud of the name  Hey man  Bulls on Parade  Is off limits today  Why is that

[02:21:00]  Yeah  Mike Francesa  Well  I've known this  For a long time  By the way  Gay  Okay  Oh boy  Okay  Hmm  Mysterious  Yeah  No  He's a man of mystery  A man of mystery  I have no fucking idea  Anyway  This happened on a show  Yesterday  Yes  Can I get your take  On the Rangers  Stuff scheme tonight  No  No you can't  Because no one cares 
[02:21:30]  Why did he do that  It's a sports show  He doesn't like talking hockey  Well there's one thing  Not liking talking hockey  Another is  You do a sports show  Someone calls  With a question  Or even  For you to comment  On a hockey game  And he gets belligerent  And wouldn't that be  Your skills  To make it interesting  Yeah that's his job  Maybe most people  Want to call  About the Giants  And the Jets  Because New York  Sports show  He's not syndicated  Is he  No but he's on 
[02:22:00]  I guess on Yes Network  It's just a New York  I guess  Yeah so  Alright so a lot of people  Want to talk football  But if you get a  Hockey call coming in  You're a sports guy  Yeah yeah  You run with it  You spin it  And make it kind of  Interesting right  Sure  He's just  It's just him  For like five and a half hours  Right  You can't give the audience  Sixty seconds of time  To talk about  Rangers hockey  You think you want to  Like you know  Whatever the listeners  Can say to help out  With the show  Yeah  He acts like his time  Is so valuable  Yeah  I used to be  I wouldn't 
[02:22:30]  I wouldn't say  Well I guess I was a fan  Of Mike the Mad Dog  Back in the day  That's kind of funny  You know you were a fan  Of the show  Get it  On my way to  Doing radio at BAB  I would listen to them  I guess  Oh  Because they were on  In the afternoon  And I would  I would do a lot of  Bike riding  And I would have them on  Yeah  Listen to it  Whatever  But uh  Yeah they don't like  Talking about  They didn't like  Talking about  No never  Talking about hockey  Back then either  Never hockey fans  Why  I don't know  It's a pretty big  It's weird  You got three hockey teams 
[02:23:00]  Yeah  Three  I think  I know it's early  In the season  And all that but  You don't have to  Treat your listeners  Like shit  For bringing it up  Like that wasn't a bad call  That was like  Right he wasn't asking  About a soda  Although I think  A prank call  Got in yesterday  I did see that  The Aaron Rodgers  I saw him asking  A caller calling in  Asking how much  He thinks tickets  Would be  To a Jets Super Bowl  And he said  Please not this early  Not this early  Not this early  That's funny 
[02:23:30]  And then he  I think  A caller got through  And asked  If he thinks  Aaron Rodgers  Drinks Diet Coke  I think that  What happened yesterday  Is that up there yet  He loves his Diet Coke  Yeah  Well I drink the Diet Coke  Who cares  Who cares  If you're going to call  They're calling about this stuff  You waited all this time  To say that  Yeah I did  Yeah  Yeah I did  It's my time  Is that okay with you Mike  Do me a favor 
[02:24:00]  If you find a book  Read it  He's an asshole  I love it  It's not up yet  No  Alright  Can we play the other clip  Oh what is this now  Yeah  Can we just play a cold  Doesn't need a setup  Okay  No  No  No  No  Somebody's going to be  In trouble today  Craig you're on the run  Of Fez show  Oh  Hey what's going on guys  Yeah  Fez you were about to say something  Right when they were talking  About goat steaks  Before Pepper over there  Started saying how much  He loves fucking goats  And Pepper  Before you defend yourself  Let Fez say what he's going to say 
[02:24:30]  I'm trying to think of what it was  Oh  It was  I believe a lion  Has a beard  I think that mane  Goes into sideburns  And stuff  So I would think  That would be another animal  That falls into the beard category  Or at least  Some sort of  Seventies hairdo  Where it's kind of  It looks blown dried  And  With the big 
[02:25:00]  Mutton chops  But it is  An animal  With facial hair  I don't think  It's part of the goat family  And even though  It's not hair  I would say  The turkey  Looks like it has a beard  With that  Red stuff  That just hangs down  Below it  Below it's chin  Below it's beak  So that's all  I was going to say  That was all I had

[02:30:00]  That black people  Do not like  That confederate flag  Well he's going to explain  Why he's wearing the damn thing  What do you mean he's wearing it  On stage  He kind of  Drapes himself in it  Well he's wearing it  On stage  He's wearing it  Out in public  And he's got  His concert t-shirts  His  Yeezus  Concert  Concert t-shirts  Have the  See here's what he's doing  He's trying to own it  Okay  He's trying to own it  So that  It doesn't have that power  To be  Racist  To black people 
[02:30:30]  The confederate flag  So he's trying to own it  Kind of like  The n-word  Much like the n-word  How we start our show today  Exactly  What a surprise  I don't think it's going to work  As far as the people  That actually  Do enjoy displaying  I don't think he's trying to  Own it  I think he's trying to make  A lot of money in merch  You think  Yeah  I think he's trying to say  Look  If I drape myself in this  And I own it  Then the southern  Racists  Won't be able to use this 
[02:31:00]  As their symbol anymore  Because people look at it  And go  Oh that's the Kanye flag  Right  Instead of you know  The flag of the south  That has been representative  Of the confederate  For many many years  A lot of people say  He's a genius  But doesn't he have to  Take away from that fact  When he  You know  Gets engaged to the stupidest  Well that's true  Woman on earth  You could be a genius  And still like a fat ass  Well that's true too  But Kim Kardashian's stupid right  Yeah but she's got that fat ass 
[02:31:30]  I think it's pretty much  Been proven at this point  She's kind of stupid  And the titties too  But he's supposed to be  Some kind of genius  But he still likes a fat ass  But he couldn't find  Like a fat ass  With maybe  Half a brain  I don't know  Generally  Like a  Generally  A woman with a fat ass  Tying it right into  The whole confederate flag thing  Fucking brilliant  Yeah that was good  Sam  Thank you very much  A woman with a fat ass  Doesn't need to be  All that smart  Cause she's got that ass  Exactly 
[02:32:00]  But there's down time  You gotta talk to that ass  Yeah there's down time  What do you do  During the down time  Go to the studio  Just leave  Go to your house  Full of monsters  Exactly  And fucking  Wax figures of sci-fi writers  Baby I got music to make  When the opster  Was putting up numbers  He had a few bird brains  But the down time  Was brutal  Oh yeah  He leaves  He says baby  Fucking brutal  I got music to make 
[02:32:30]  Make sure that fat ass  Is waiting for me  When I get home  Yeah  That's it  Word  So now  Is Kanye  Like anybody  Can just pop the  Confederate flag on  And sell it as merch  I guess  I guess  Well you gotta mix it up  A little bit  Yeah  But I mean  Anyone can do that  You don't have to  I guess there's no one  To really pay for it  I was gonna ask  Who owns the copyright  Yeah you could do that  With any flag  Of any nation I gather  Well let's see  How he explains it here  Oh nice  The tour merch  I read  Which I thought  Was kind of like 
[02:33:00]  Hmm  But people  I feel like people  Just want to find  Something to get  Yeah  You know  They just want to get  All riled up about something  But it was about  The tour merch  And the confederate flags  And the skeleton imagery  And things like that  I mean do you think  People are overreacting  With this  React how you want  Like I said  It's making them react  I guess  Right  Any energy you got  Is good energy  You know the confederate flag  Represented  Slavery  Good  In a way  The way  My abstract  That's my abstract take  On what I know  About it  Right  So I made the song  New Slaves  So I took the confederate flag 
[02:33:30]  And made it my flag  It's my flag now  Now what you gonna do  Well  Now what you gonna do  He's an idiot  Now what you gonna do  Display it prominently  In the south  Where they hate you  That's all  That's what they'll still do  I don't think  You're gonna be  Taking that flag  I don't think you're owning it  From the people that  The people that don't like  Black people  I don't think they're gonna  Consider it his flag  He's just an idiot  Kanye's gonna be wearing  A fucking Klan outfit  On stage  It's mine now  I just like the Kuka Klan 
[02:34:00]  Motherfucker  It's mine  Nah  I own this shit  Now what you gonna do  Look I'm lynching  Motherfuckers  Now what you gonna do  It's mine  That's what I do  There's a long history  This shit  Yeah  Just trying to  You know  Drum up some attention  They all do it right  What is the Gaga  Doing these days  For her attention  She's going out  Looking fucking crazy  She's walking around  With potatoes on her fucking face  What is she doing  Yeah what is her thing  This week  Right  She's going around  Looking like monsters  And stuff  What do you mean  Well it's Halloween  Oh look at her

[02:35:30]  Colorado  How is he gonna  Let's see how this is  I know  What is the other  Hey there  Well it was the flag  Of the south right  Yeah  But not all of them  Were into the slave thing  Right  But they all  Listen  It was all about  States' rights  The confederate flag  Of course  Nothing to do with  Slavery  Or the civil war  It was all about  States' rights  And that's it  And everyone loves  This fucking  Revisionist history  Kanye West is a cunt  A fucking dumb  Cunt  Yeah  Well I won't disagree 
[02:36:00]  With that  But one of the  States' rights  That they wanted to  Maintain was the right  To have slaves  Right  It's one of them  Just one  I mean that was  That was the sticking point  With a lot of people  I think  Yeah you know  I don't know  It's uh  The civil war  Was based on  Quite a few things  Slavery was a tactic  That was used  I mean  The north  Um  Wanting to take away  The south's slaves  Would have just  Whittled down their manpower  You know  If you got  Uh  The guys in the south 
[02:36:30]  Not allowed to have slaves  And then they have to  Work their fields  That's less men  That could be out there  Fighting the north  So obviously  The north  Not being so  Fucking noble  That they just  Wanted to free the slaves  They wanted to  Take power away  From the south  So they couldn't  Secede from the union  Every  Every tactic  That they could  Possibly use  They wanted to use  And that was one of them  You're trying to say  There was an ulterior motive  There  Of course  Yes  There wasn't this  Noble idea  That everyone  Didn't think  Let's free the slaves 
[02:37:00]  Like  Let's fuck the south  And uh  You know  Take away their  Their manpower  I saw that movie  Lincoln  He seemed noble  Lincoln  Yeah  Lincoln  I pronounced the L  By the way  Both of them  Lincoln  Lincoln  What is with that L  Hard to believe  That people were actually noble  Yeah  You're talking about like  No nobility there  And the fact of the matter  You're talking about like  People  Doing your stuff  Right  For free  It's pretty handy  No I understand that 
[02:37:30]  But as a human being  You know  Right  That's tough to give up  Oh man is it  You have to be extremely noble  To go  Ah damn it  Now I gotta do my own stuff  Just think of it  When you're growing up  And your mom is doing your laundry  Making your bed  Cooking your meals  Everything like that  And then you move out  And you're like  Wouldn't it be great  To still have somebody  That could do that for free  Sam you're out of this conversation  Because your mom still does your shit  That's true  Forgot about that  I'm sorry  Yeah  But you know what I mean  So you're trying to tell me  Human beings were so noble  So noble  That they were willing  To give up the fact 
[02:38:00]  That all their stuff  Would be  Yeah  You know  Done for them  Yeah  Or was there an ulterior motive  Going well look  You're gonna have to start  Doing your own stuff  But  Yeah  We're gonna win this thing  If you're a war  If you're warring  Against some people  And you know  You have a way  To keep them  From picking up a gun  And fighting  Because they have to  Right  You know  Still  Still make the resources  To keep that army going  You're gonna do that  Not so much for the reason  That you think  All men are free  But you don't want 
[02:38:30]  People shooting at you  I hate how we  Romanticize  Stuff that happened  In history  And then Lincoln  With the Great Emancipation  Proclamation  And then  He wanted to actually  They were considering  Sending all the  Former slaves  Back to Africa  Lincoln himself  Had discussed that  As a viable option  Just hard to believe  That the whole conscience  Of the country  You know  Thought it would be  A noble thing to do  Yeah  That's hard  That's hard  A majority  No 
[02:39:00]  In the end  In the end  Yeah  I will summarize  Then I will hand in my paper  And see what the  See what the teacher  Gives you  In the end  It was obviously  The right thing to do  Okay  Yeah  But the reason for it  But the reason for it  I just don't buy  Yeah  That everyone got together  As one  And said  This is a noble thing  To do  No way  DDL seemed  Very noble in that movie  Yeah  Oh no  No  DDL  No no no  DDL 
[02:39:30]  Yeah  Yeah  Daniel Day Lewis  Daniel Day Lewis  I want to talk to  Oliver Stone about that  Why  Because he's a history dude  Yeah  Let's ask you about  The slave thing  Yeah  And here's another  Thought on the Kanye  He's got the confederate flag  And he's going to be  Touring in the south  Yeah  That's not going to go well  He has security  Check his dates  But someone is going to  Have a problem with that  Perhaps  Or they'll be like  Yeah  I will assume that 
[02:40:00]  You're representing the south  Yo  There's going to be a bottle  Of two thrown  But maybe not  Because you know  He's not doing a ton of dates  In the south  He's doing three dates in Texas  Texas is different  It is  Texas is pretty much  Their own country  That's Georgia though  Westy  He is doing Georgia  It all depends though  That's Atlanta  ATL  Atlanta  Nashville  Atlanta hasn't been in the south  Since they set it all on fire  And shit  My point being  As you look at his tour schedule  He's not that brave  Yeah  I'm looking  He's squeezing a little 
[02:40:30]  Atlanta in there  Wow  Look out  Brooklyn  Wow  He's going to upset  A lot of people  Brooklyn  St. Louis  Missouri  I don't see the Carolinas  In there  No  I don't see fucking  West Virginia  I don't see the Alabama man  In there  No  We should all go as a show  Where's Louisiana  I don't see the Louisiana  New Orleans  Yeah  New Orleans  He's got New Orleans up there  New Orleans  Alright  Those are very calculated southern cities 
[02:41:00]  Very  Very urban  Oh yeah  Well I mean  Very calculated  He's going to his audience too  Of course  But look at most of the dates  Are up north  Canada  Like I would say  Most of the places  That really embrace  The stars and bars  Yeah  Probably wouldn't go check out  A Kanye West concert  Probably wouldn't  No matter where it was  Right  Look it's  I mean  This is why the guy's  Such a fraud  Denver  Fraud  Minneapolis  Chicago  Columbus  Ohio 
[02:41:30]  Chicago  Detroit  Toronto  Toronto  Montreal  It's my flag now  What you going to do  What you going to do  Toronto  Philadelphia  Boston  You're going to have to get a passport  Yeah  Brooklyn  Brooklyn  Washington D.C.  New York  New York  My flag D.C.  And you finally get some  South action  Nashville  Miami  That's scary  Miami's a scary place  Tampa's a scary place  Atlanta  Then it goes up to St. Louis  Back to Kansas City 
[02:42:00]  My flag Anaheim  Then New Orleans  Phoenix  Dallas  Houston  San Antonio  Phoenix  And Anaheim  Yeah you're fucking brave  Jesus  Just  The fucking worst  I don't know  That whole slavery thing  Just really  It was a big misunderstanding  Just  It's a bee in my bonnet  What are you talking about  In your bonnet  Can I just  Can I just condense  The whole slavery thing  Down to being a bee 
[02:42:30]  In my bonnet  What can we have  Just changed it into  Like I don't know  Cheap labor  Yeah yeah  Well there were indentures  I got cheap labor  I got cheap labor right now  If they went away  I'd be kind of fucked  Be pissed off right  Yes  Yeah  Why weren't they smart enough  To go  Alright alright  The slave thing's crazy  But let's  Let's pay you  Pay you a wage  Right after slavery  They had indentured servitude  Yeah  Which was also bad  Well  Well  Because people would  Just go into debt  And know the landowner 
[02:43:00]  Forever  I don't know  Yeah  What  You give them room  And board  Right  It's nothing worse  Than Alice the Maid  Had on the Brady Bunch  Sam you relax  Because you wouldn't  Be here today  If Mr. Jefferson  Yeah  Didn't have a slave  Of his own  What Jefferson was saying  Is hey I gotta fuck  Some of this  Black quim  That I got around  The plantation  Make a young  Sam Roberts  Maybe you're right  Maybe it all  Did work out  For the best  Here's Jefferson  Ah what's your name

[02:45:30]  I was watching all about  Eisenhower last night  Yeah  He just used to take over  Countries  Non-stop  It was the time  He was just overtaking  Fucking people  You had to  Non-stop  All day long  It was the time  You know those commies  Not to be trusted  Yeah we should have  Made them into states  He took over  He killed Patrice Lavumba  What  Well  He was hilarious  I loved when he was  On our show  No  He was some  La Mumba  Oh  In the Congo 
[02:46:00]  I think Eisenhower  Was my dad's  Favorite president  Not Oliver Stone's  Really  Well we're gonna have  A problem there  Uh oh  We're gonna have  A fucking problem  With Oliver Stone's  Could be a fucking problem  I think Oliver Stone's  Least favorite presidents  Yeah  George W. Bush  Uh huh  Then Truman  Then Eisenhower  Why Truman  He hated Truman  Because of the bomb  Yep  Hated Truman  Because of the atomic bomb  You gotta watch the bomb  Documentary  He hated Truman  But the bomb  Made everything nice  Oh the bomb  Ended that fucking war  And it made everything nice  For those people 
[02:46:30]  Lickety split  They got nicer stuff now  They did  He said the Japanese  Probably would have surrendered  In like two weeks  No they weren't surrendering  In two weeks  No  That I know  Probably  In a couple weeks  Maybe not two  Even after two  Even after two atomic bombs  They weren't ready  To fess up  With unconditional surrender  There  That'd be a lot  Of talking going on  And  The emperor  Was all for it  But the military  Branch of Japan  They didn't want it  And they actually  Sent people over  To fucking  Fuck with the emperor  That's how  That's how much 
[02:47:00]  They didn't want to  End the war  So  If there wasn't  Two atomic bombs  We'd have had to invade  Can I take it  One step further  I think  They owe us an apology  Who  The Japs  The Japs  That's what they call them  That's what they called them  Back in the day  They called them the Japs  And the Germans  Were the Jerry's  Right  Jerry's  The Jerry's  Ah  Some Jerry's  Are over the hill  Let's kill those Jerry's  Yep  I think they owe us an apology  They got some kickass stuff  Over there now  Yep  Brand new shit  Do you know how far 
[02:47:30]  They came from  Nice subways  That's made in Japan  It's Japanese junk  Right  To  Oh cool  I did some good  Japanese electronics  And you know why  It's cool  Because  Brand new factories  Oh yeah  We hung out  How do they get the space for that  Well we destroyed the old ones  Of course  But you know  The phoenix rose in that area  Marshall plan  So we get credit for the rising of the phoenix  In that area  Yep  Yeah  And they owe us an apology  We hung out  The way of life is way better in the end  Because of this  After World War II  We hung out for a couple years  To make sure no shenanigans were going on 
[02:48:00]  Yeah  And that they built everything  Back up  And everything was nice and nice  Yeah  I was learning all about the satellites  I think in the year  Because of the little satellites  That we put all over  Yeah we had to  Because the Soviets  Were making their own grab  You know  Just a little one  Like just a little  I'm sorry  But you know  A little one  So sorry  That's all we want  Okay  I appreciate that  So sorry  I think that's fair  We gotta get ready for Oliver Stone  We gotta prepare 
[02:48:30]  By the way  We fucked over the Soviets  Good  How do we do that?  We could have fucking been on their side  From the beginning of like World War II  And we were like  No way Stalin  We don't trust you  But he wasn't to be trusted  We knew that much  And we were a little busy  With the fucking Pacific War  And a European war  And  So when the Nazis decided to stab  Old Stalin in the back  And attack Russia  What were we supposed to do?  Pour troops in there?  They had fucking millions of Russians  That fought them off  And they wound up fucking kicking 
[02:49:00]  The Germans ass anyway  Did you say Pacific War?  Yes  Can you please say  The Pacific Theater?  Thank you  The Pacific Theater of Operations  Thank you  It was the Pacific Theater  And our victory in Europe  Yes  Pretty much actually a Soviet victory  Well it was  The Soviets actually  Well actually  The final push into Berlin  Right  Were Soviets  Right  But  The ability to get to Berlin  Was because  So many troops  Had to be pulled off  Of the Eastern Front 
[02:49:30]  Because of the invasion  That took place  The Nazis  Had a two front war  And that was directly  Because of us  And England  Going in there  So the Soviets  You know  Though they did  Step into Berlin  First  I mean who really  Fucking set it all up for them  Just don't get him  Started on Truman  That's all I'm saying  Well  Capote  What's the problem with him?  With that said  We gotta take a quick break  So we can get ready  For Oliver Stone  And Canada  I'm sorry  You fucking Canadians  Of course  Alright  You took the easiest beach

Hey boys  Hey  First off  Do your research  The flag he's using  Is a rectangular flag  Which makes it the  Confederate naval battle ensign  That flag never was  The Confederate  Government flag  At this point in history  That becomes  Inconsequential 
[02:53:00]  The stars and bars  The stars and bars  In any incarnation  Is looked at  By certain people  As the Confederate flag  The flag of the south  The flag of the Confederacy  The racist flag  Of America  Whatever the fuck  You wanna call it  But that's  That's perpetuating  Ignorance though  Anthony  Well  I'm just saying  It's  Alright well we cleared  It up here today  Yeah  Alright we cleared  It up though  Yeah  So maybe he's picking  That version of the flag  Cause then it's not as bad

Ricky Gervais  Ricky Gervais  Oh yeah  That guy  No we did it  To somebody else too  Yeah we did  The list is long  I know  A long and prestigious list  There was one  The beauty of doing radio  A lot of these guys  Don't know  You know  What we look like  We walked out  And they were standing  Outside the door  It wasn't Ricky Gervais  No you're right  This was somebody  Waiting to come in 
[03:02:30]  And we awkwardly  Walked past them  And they didn't know  It was us  It could have been  Tom Hiddlestrom  From Thor  It could have been  David Tyree  From the Giants  No I ducked my head down  And I knew who it was  It was an older guy  It was a biggie  It was a James Cromwell  James Cromwell  Ah James Cromwell  Jim and me  Interviewed James Cromwell  But then we interviewed him  And we had a blast  I liked it  Anthony goes  You're going to have  A good time in there  And he's like  What's he doing  I did  What's he doing  You're going to have  A good time in there  What's he doing  Yes  I'm like  Girl walk fast  I'll be listening

[03:03:30]  We might have time to  Play an Art Garfunkel song  For his birthday  Uh oh  Is it Art Garfunkel's birthday  How old is Art?  72  No he's not  No  Brian Adams is 54 today  Is Art Garfunkel 72  Are you kidding me?  No  Wow  That's about right  That's about right  What?  Prepare muchachita  I would have put him at 68  I don't know why  I would have put him at 70  Bridge over troubled water  Is that his biggest song?  I think we did everything today actually 
[03:04:00]  And then we have a Russian teen  I'm assuming she's ugly  Because she only got $27,000 for her virginity online  That's it?  That's the new thing  Euros or American?  I guess it's $27,000  She's got to be homely, right?  I would think  Russian teen allegedly auctions off virginity for $27,000 online  Here, pop the screen on 
[03:04:30]  Where's that?  Oh  Thank you, Iraq  Is that her?  Oh, okay  I was completely wrong  20 what?  $27,000  You could have had that  $27,000 large  She looks like a young Teresa  And she did it?  With ice?  Yeah, good ice  Is this all done?  Yeah  Why?  You want to make one final bid?  Yeah, I might throw a few  But no  I'm just saying  Like 
[03:05:00]  It's not bad  But  Uh-oh  Oliver Stone is right outside the studio  Alright  He's right there  Where is he, Roland?  Tell Kenny he gets a car  Where is he now?  Let's go  He's still stuck in traffic  Kenny!  We're just wasting time  I'm out of here, Kenny  Alright  There he goes  Look, Kenny's taking the walk  So  You get one  I'm giving one to Travis  Alright  He wants to  Look how flustered he is 
[03:05:30]  You get one  But Roland  He's still got to know that  We will stay late  I don't do that  Johnny never did that  He did it once  What?  He didn't stay late  No, he just left  He was like  Fuck this place  Oh, what time is Frank getting here?  I'll wait for Frank Sinatra  No  He left  But he is Johnny Carson  But we're Opie and Anthony  Well  That used to have some juice  Not so much these days  Alright 
[03:06:00]  Are you kidding?  Jesus  We'll try again tomorrow, boys  Try again tomorrow  Who do we have tomorrow?  Jason Statham and Dr. J  Oh, Jason Statham  Can't we just replay  The Last Night of Zion?  With a fast-driving car  Fight movie?  Adrenaline thing  I bet you we could play  The Jason Statham  Oh my god  Interview from last time  And just put in the new movie  Where we talked  And it would be  It would be  First of all  It would make sense  It would make sense  Yeah 
[03:06:30]  We should do that  No  Can we do that?  No  Can we do that?  No  We've been so good  A real bad fucking  I'm telling you right now  Dubbing in of the new movie name  If a radio show did that  I would be all in listening  That'd be hilarious  So let's take the last  Jason Statham interview  And every time he mentions  The old movie  Put in the new movie  Put in the new movie name  And let's see how  How it works out  Oh my god  We should do that  That'd be hilarious  That's incredible  That's destructive 
[03:07:00]  It's hilarious  That's destructive  Destructive  We might just throw  A serial item  And just yell at them  What's his new movie?  What's his new movie?  The  I forgot the name  The fast car  The fight  E-Rock says he's been in twice this year  Yeah  So we could take a pick  From either interview  That's true  I actually like her  I like Jason Statham  He's cool  But now I want to do  Now I want to do that bit  Just to see how it would sound  I know  It'd be funny  It could be a boss  I know  But  What's the name of his new movie?  The Lone 
[03:07:30]  Lone Ranger  Gunman  I don't know  My brain just  Lone Wolf  Wolf  How you doing Roland?  You know  Jason Statham  I love  His new movie  Redemption  Fast and Furious  Redemption was the last one  Homefront  Oh that's just like  Lone  That sounds  Former DEA agent  Moves his family  To a quiet town  Where he soon  I bet it's not going to be quiet  I bet it doesn't stay quiet  What happened?  He soon  Tangles with a local meth drug lord 
[03:08:00]  Damn  Played by James Franco  Uh oh  James Franco  Jason Statham would kick the shit out of James Franco  Not even a fucking issue  Franco's alright  He's funny  I like him  You diggin' Franco?  Yeah  I love him  This is the end  He was good  I can't get that Academy Award thing out of my head  You didn't like this is the end did you?  I loved it  I liked it  It was okay  I absolutely  It was more than okay for me  It was okay for me  I thought it was very self-serving of all of them  I loved that movie  It's like  It was like going to a party 
[03:08:30]  Having everybody at the party be so buddy-buddy  And you're just kind of on the outside looking in going  I don't belong here  Yeah but it was like telling a cheat though  They were goofing on the whole thing  But they were  That's just it  They're goofing on it going  Look how cool we are  We're so cool that we can goof on how cool we are  Yeah  Ah  Ah  We do that every day here  Yeah but that's us  True  He just checked in so we could bring him back to the after show now  Or we could wait  Roland is freaking out  I swear to you today 
[03:09:00]  I can't say it  I can't either  Sam can do it  Because I see it in your face  You need us  But I swear today  I really can't  That's alright  I can't  Leave us a hand  No I'd love to  But I can't  How about that to Sam  Sorry I'm prepping for an Oliver Stone interview  Yeah you gotta prep  I'll go get him then  Can't wait to listen to this  He's coming upstairs now  He's coming upstairs now  He's pretty famous though  To walk yonder  You want us to walk away  He wants you guys to take a hike 
[03:09:30]  Hey you know what  Tell him sorry  The show was fucking 10 o'clock  Right  It ends  I don't stay late for nobody  No  No we know that  Wow  He said adios muchachitos  I uh  Yeah  I mean really  I just don't care about  Like  I don't know  His movies are awesome  I talked to him already  Alright  And  Can I meet him  I need a picture  Oh Jesus  Tell him you're the engineer  You look tired  So maybe next time  Oh damn  I'd love to 
[03:10:00]  That was low blow  No  Damn that was  That was mean  That was mean  I just knew that  There's a sign  Yeah for Jimmy  Yeah  So when he's here talking  He's like  Oh my guys  Oh no no no  Oh god there he is  Oh my god  Uh oh  Now you're being pointed at  There's a problem  Okay  There's a problem now  What the fuck  I don't see Howard  Staying late for a guest  Okay  Maybe he does 
[03:10:30]  I don't know  Easy transition  Easy transition  There we go  Now  It's the after show  I guess so  Look how quick that was  Like a  Like a moth  Metamorphosizing  From a  From a fucking  Whatever  Thank you  Alright  Okay  Can I see in the corner  Watch the interview  What  Imagine you can just  Sit here and watch it  That would be great  Alright  Have fun  I'll be listening  Okay  Do us proud  Oliver  Taking a pic  Alright

[03:11:30]  He can come in later  Sal you got that  Taken care of  Apparently ladies and gentlemen  This is the after show  And I'll be interviewing  Oliver Stone today  As he comes in  This is a test for me  Because  You think so  Oh yeah  Alright  Rolling  Are you nervous  No  I mean  Cause what's  What's gonna happen  Have a shitty interview  With Oliver Stone  Everybody laughs at it anyway  So  Sam  Yeah  Since we got a moment  Can I just hit the intro 
[03:12:00]  So we can separate this  No  No  This is  I'm not  This is gonna sound so awkward  When we cut it out  Alright  Let it sound awkward  I like that  It should be awkward  Alright  This isn't my fault  You can sit him in  The guest seat  Not the merch chair  It's like 50 things  Yeah  Yeah  Oliver Stone's making his way in  I've been on this show before  But not with me before  No  No no no  I've been in this room  You have been in this room  Mr. Stone  How are you  Welcome  How are you 
[03:12:30]  Who are you  What's your name  My name is Sam Roberts  Okay  It's a pleasure to meet you  Huh  Who are you though  Opie  No no no  Opie  I'm filling in for Opie and Anthony  Oh what the hell  Well you  I came to see Opie and Anthony  I know  We all did  But they have a stringent schedule  That they have to adhere to  Oh shit  Is that the  Is that the  Ones I talked to before  Yes  Oh too bad  That's alright  They wanted to give me a turn  You have fun  Don't worry about it  Your name is Sam  My name is Sam  I'm happy to have met you  You're listening to the show  Oh yeah 
[03:13:00]  Oh there's tons of people listening  Everybody  Yes we are  We're live  We're live all this time  Oh yeah  I walked in  Oh yeah  Well that's why people listen  They like the  The realism  And the naturalness  And the  You have to be excited  Is it nice  To be able to go out  And have a ton  Of stuff to promote  Do you like that  No  You don't like that  I'm not a very good  Promotional person  But I try  I feel like we make  The best effort  Do you like working  On a lot at once  Or do you like  Do you tend to just focus 
[03:13:30]  I'd like to be retired  Wiggling my toes in the ocean  And just taking it easy  With beautiful girls around  See that sounds  Great  But I don't believe that  Because  Anybody who wants to be retired  I would think  Isn't going to say  What's wrong with retirement  I think it's a good thing  But I don't think  That somebody who wants to be retired  Says I want to make a  12 hour documentary  On America  Believe me  After doing that  I think I have  I met my maker  You know  That was a tough one  Yeah  Now you strike me  I was watching  Yeah yeah  Go ahead  Put the headphones on  Join the show 
[03:14:00]  Have a great time  You strike me  Give me a coffee  I just come from  Democracy Now with Amy  Somebody bring Mr. Stone a coffee  I've been at it  Since 7 this morning  Jesus  And how long  All day press  And all night  All night tonight too  I was hanging out  Last night  This is what happens  You get to New York  I did Piers Morgan last night  How was that  9 to 10  And then I did  Piers is great  You know him  Yeah of course  He's been in before  Very charming  And you guys  Probably line up the same  On a lot of your  Opinions politically 
[03:14:30]  Possibly  I would think so  We didn't get to the bottom of that  How difficult is it for you  To try to separate  Because  I watched the  Untold History of the US  I've been watching it  It took me several days  Did you really  Oh yeah yeah  That's fabulous  Very few people  Actually sit and watch  Because it's really  It's a lot  It's a lot of work  And it's a movie  It's a real movie  But it is  It is good in the sense  That like you're telling stories  You know what I mean  It's not that sort of  You don't feel like  You're in history class  There's no  And no  You know as a documentary 
[03:15:00]  There's no talking heads  Which  Yeah  Always slows down films  And make these heavy  Tedious points  I mean it is a flow  It goes like poetry  The imagery  The cutting is like JFK  The  You know  Remember the scene  And mixing documentary  Yeah  With narration  It flows  Yeah  It's got poetry  And you did an amazing job  Of the found footage  That you got  Not just in the newsreel stuff  But in the animations  Yeah  And the sort of  Like the World War II stuff  Where you know  Russia's taking over  All the land and everything 
[03:15:30]  I would assume  Most of that was not  Originally produced for you  It was  No we did  Of the time  We looked for all the maps  We could get  But some of them  Are difficult to render  We also did modern maps  Which is to say  We went back into those eras  And we did modern creations  Of those maps  Which were even easier  To read for the audience  Because maps are crucial  To understand  The  With the biggest land  Grab  Was the British Empire  You know  Let's be honest  When you said  The Russian Empire  It was the British Empire  That had the most amount 
[03:16:00]  Of territory  Now how long did this take  The whole thing  From start to back  Five years  Off and on  I did W  I did Wall Street  Money Never Sleeps  And Savages  As well as  The South of the Border  But during this period  I was always working  In terms of going back  To history  And did you treat  Because the documentary  Is broken up into  Ten  And then on the Blu-ray  Twelve chapters  Right  Did you treat them  Like individual pieces  When you were building it  Or did you treat it  Everyone had to be  Fifty-eight minutes  And thirty seconds  It is discipline 
[03:16:30]  It's like television  Right  You have to tell  You know  Set your hook  Sell the story  And you have to go  You have to go  Stick to the big picture  What you think  Is the big picture  All this has been  Fact-checked  More than once  It was a tedious  Rewrite job  And to simplify  I mean you see  The prose  I mean the book  Is eight hundred pages  You know  How to get that down  To fifty-eight minutes  For each decade  Right  Is the key  So you have to stick  To the big picture  Big narrative line  And we use movie clips  Don't forget  And they're very helpful 
[03:17:00]  To cut through  Because the movies  Are of that time  Right  And it kind of like  You know  They'll show  Whatever  Mr. Smith goes to  Washington  Or whatever movie  That relates to  The era in the issue  That they're talking about  How hard is it for you  Though  To remove  Opinion  Because this is something  You're passionate about  And obviously  You have opinions  On the stuff  And the opinions  Do bleed through  You know  And that's part of  What makes it  Oliver Stone's  Good  Well  You know Sam  I have to say  Really  That I was  I approached this  With a historian 
[03:17:30]  And I never  Considered myself  A historian  I was a dramatist  I was dramatizing history  But I worked very closely  With Peter Kuznick  Who wrote the book  With me  And wrote these chapters  And he had a staff  He was an American  University professor  Of history  He taught it for thirty years  He's a director  Of the Nuclear  Studies Institute  At American  He's specialized  In the atomic bomb  And scientists  And you know  Everything we did  Was just refined  And refined  Now there's a lot  A body of facts 
[03:18:00]  We select the facts  That we think  Are important  Sure  And we give you  You know  There is a flow  And at the end  Of each chapter  Sometimes in the middle  We do speculations  And opinions  As you say  And as I was watching  I mean  And the kind of  Overall thing  Like it's no secret  To me  That you were not  A fan of  Of Harry Truman  For example  I think we did show you  A body of evidence  That he was not the man  That you had  That you thought he was  Right  That he was not up  To that  Vision that Roosevelt  Had started 
[03:18:30]  And stood for  As the grand alliance  Between the Soviet Union  The British  And the Americans  So and is that a goal  Of yours  For people to come out  No there were no goals  There were no goals  I mean Peter has been  Signing this thing  Felt strongly about  The atomic bombs  That the two original  Atomic bombs  Did not have to be dropped  But we made our case  And by the way  I would like to say  This is not Peter's history  This is  He studied under  The revisionists  The revisionists  Came into being  Really around the Cold War  But they started writing  A lot of them were younger  And they started writing 
[03:19:00]  In 1959  You had people like  Like Fleming  Like Gar Alperovitz  Richard Appelman  William Appelman Williams  Lloyd Gardner  Gabriel Coco  It's a body of history  That we built on  It's not like  We went out there  And decided to attack Truman  That's what you make it sound like  It's not at all  No  Truman had been attacked  And Walter Lippmann  Who was one of the great  Minds of that era  Was very critical  Of Truman's doctrine  The Truman Doctrine  In March 1947 
[03:19:30]  Lending 400 million  Giving 400 million dollars  To Greece and Turkey  Saying look  We're going to be fighting  Communists and terrorists  He used those words  Everywhere in the world  Everywhere in the world  He made it a principle  Basically  And by doing that  He was fighting  The people who had in fact  Fought the Nazis in Greece  You have to understand  It was a huge  At that time  In 1947  That was a divider  And people of Walter Lippmann's  Stature were attacking Truman  So we're not out there  In left field  Coming out and saying  We're doing  A real  You're not uncovering this 
[03:20:00]  This stuff is old  It's been written about  But it's been ignored  And basically  American government  And American history  Has moved to the right  And this  The body  The so-called  Assumed evidence  Has moved more and more  To the right  We're trying to do justice  To history  And say no  Keep in mind  What was really happening  In that time period  Where do you think  Network news now leans  Obviously you have  A channel like Fox News  That I feel like  Unapologetically  Leans to the right  But do you think  That  We're living in an age 
[03:20:30]  Of you know  That's  It's hollow  Hollow news  I don't  I think  In general  Study history  You can't get  The patterns  Of things  You can't understand  What's really happening  Unless you look  At history  Well yeah  And part of going  Through all the documentaries  Is that you kind of see  Where things start to change  And you kind of see  After World War II  It becomes  Things become  Shrouded in secrecy  And there's a lot more  Right away  Yeah  Do you think though  First of all  Do you think  We're also promoting 
[03:21:00]  JFK  The big  Director's Cup  Blu-ray  Box set  Huge thing  That's coming out  On Tuesday  The 50th  Anniversary  Of JFK's death  Do you think  That that was  An inside  Job  Do you think  You're jumping around  A lot here  I know  Yeah  But in historical terms  It's very  I don't know  How serious  You want to get  But you know  Look  Truman comes along  And we go  Quickly from  World War II  Situation  We accelerate  Into a national  Security state  Eisenhower  Comes into office  In 52  And continues  The growth 
[03:21:30]  Of that national  Security state  We become  Armed to the teeth  And the thing  That was interesting  About Eisenhower  Is when you watch  It and you see  In the context  You see that  This is where  This whole trend  Of going into  Countries  And overthrowing  Leaders  And all that  Started  Yeah  Under Eisenhower  And his  Secretary of State  Dulles  We had a  Huge  Interventions  In Iran  In Guatemala  We tried  In Indonesia  To get rid  Of Sukarno  We tried  To get rid  Of Lumumba  In Angola 
[03:22:00]  Yeah  We repeat  And in Vietnam  We participated  With the French  We supported  Their war  We financed  Most of it  Nuclear threats  Were made  Against China  Were made  Against Russia  Eisenhower  Is not at all  What he seems  Although at the  End of his regime  He does  In his farewell  In dress  He does address  That horrible issue  About the military  Industrial complex  Which he helped  Create  Yeah  We went from  Approximately  More than  A little more  Than a thousand  Nuclear weapons  Under  In 1952  To approximately  By 1962 
[03:22:30]  Under Eisenhower's  Budgeting cycle  30,000  Nuclear weapons  We were 10 to 1  At least 10 to 1  Stronger than the  Soviet Union  Although the Soviet Union  Was pictured  As threatening to us  And it's insane too  When you think about it  In the context of  Only a few years  Before that  The whole idea  Of a nuclear bomb  Was this sort of  Foreign  Sci-fi movie weapon  Well that was  The Jewish scientists  In Europe  Had been developing it  And we brought  Many of them  To America  To get it here  And they were brilliant 
[03:23:00]  And what Henry Wallace  And Oppenheimer knew  Is that this was  Not a secret  They would  They would eventually  Everyone would  Eventually get it  Because scientists  Are bringing men  They work for  Different countries  And so forth  And so on  And there was  Espionage too  So  But I ask you  About the JFK  Conspiracy  Let's go back to that  But I'm just saying  That under Eisenhower  And Truman  You have two older men  Who build up  This  We are the most  Formidable power  On earth  In 1960  A young man  Comes in  And he's facing 
[03:23:30]  All of a sudden  A military  That has essentially  Reached a place  Where  And I'm going to  Cut right to the chase  And their thinking  Is look  We've had five or six  Major crises  With the Soviets  Now  The communists  Are definitely  Our worst enemies  And they're going to  We have to deal with this  They are going to  Get stronger over time  We now have this  First strike capability  We can take them out  And this is hard thinking  Now  And we can  And we can  If they retaliate  We can sustain  The casualties  This was the basis  Of that movie  Dr. Strangelove 
[03:24:00]  Which  Of course  So brilliantly  You found  The General Jack Rippers  The General George C. Scott  In that movie  They were talking  In these terms  Kennedy found himself  In a similar situation  He was a bit like  That president in the movie  He was more of a  A peace man  And he  He did not want war  He did not want to support  The Bay of Pigs invasion  Which Eisenhower  Would have done  When we went in there  They needed air support  From the US  To carry through the invasion  They didn't get it  They thought they'd get it  Kennedy did not give it  He fired Alan Dulles  At that point 
[03:24:30]  You begin to see the split  Right away  Between Kennedy  And the CIA  And the military  Sure  That's a big thing  And so  Because I wonder  You know  We were talking about  The secrecy  That came into the government  Before  And I feel like  As far as  Grand conspiracies go  Especially when you're  Talking about a JFK  When you're talking about  A 9-11  Whatever it is  The bigger the conspiracy  The more people  That have to be in  On this thing  And I find it hard  To believe  With a lot of these  Especially with JFK  It's been 50 years  Sure  That nobody 
[03:25:00]  Would have by now  Well people have talked  I mean there's all been  All kinds of leaks  It's just  You know  I mean you're jumping  Ahead  I mean I'm just trying  To tell you  That let's build  The story a little bit  So you understand  The hostility to Kennedy  Because that's what we do  In Untold History  We don't go into  The assassination  Yeah but I don't have  12 hours  But it's important  To understand that  Kennedy had made  Many enemies by  1963  When he refused  To go into Laos  He sent non-combat advisors  To Vietnam  They wanted a war  We had built up 
[03:25:30]  This place  Where we really  Wanted to go to war  We wanted to lock in  And do the final solution  So there was a reason  To people not want  Kennedy to be in his seat  I would say  Yeah  I would say  And that's not debatable  He fired Dulles  And he fired  The three other  Top people at the CIA  He thought his generals  He made critical comments  On his generals  Which is historically factual  We're not making this up  He was  And by the time  Of the missile crisis  In 1962  After the Berlin scare  We almost had a war  In 1961  With the Berlin crisis 
[03:26:00]  And Kennedy said  That famous quote  He said  I'd rather have a wall  Than a war  He meant it  Yeah sure  So you know  A nuclear war  Is not for fun  I mean in Cuba  The 1962 situation  It was much heavier  Than we thought  McNamara  After that crisis  When he found out  The facts  That they were  Much more armed  Than we thought they were  They had 100 nuclear  Battlefield weapons  40,000 Russian troops  Commanded by the  Commander of Stalingrad  The Cubans  Were 270,000 soldiers  Well armed  Yeah  We would have had  Much more casualties 
[03:26:30]  Than we had planned  We wanted to invade Cuba  Because  If we couldn't invade Cuba  Which is 90 miles  From our shores  We consider ourselves  Impotent  With all this weaponry  We had  Here we were  Defeated by a little David  And we were Goliath  You know who you remind me of?  You remind me of my dad  I'll tell you why  My dad was like  And this is a good thing  My dad was just  Was an ad executive  For a long time  And he spent all his time  At work and everything  But whenever  I had history homework  To do  That was where  He was passionate  I never saw him 
[03:27:00]  Passionate  Until he was talking  To me about  United States  And world history  And I feel like  There are guys like him  And guys like you  Who have these  Amazing jobs  You're a film director  Yeah I have to tell the story  And I feel like  But your passion  I feel like  You should have been  A history teacher  Is that something  You always wanted to do?  Perhaps I was  I consider myself  A dramatist  But I love history  Yeah  And I like to dramatize it  Yeah  My father was also dramatic  But he was very conservative  So I had the  I had the anti-Roosevelt  Point of view 
[03:27:30]  And do you think  That that's  Bro Eisenhower  Do you think  That your dad  Being conservative  Very much  Pushed you in the other direction?  No  Because I had to find out  It took me 30  Until I was about 38 years old  I was not  Before you like  Really established  A good opinion?  Yeah  I mean it was slow  It was not easy  To do  I had to go to Vietnam  I had to learn  My own way through life  Were you a history buff  Growing up?  Yes  Yes  You were  So even in your party days  I loved the cowboys  And Indians  Yeah  I did  And I saw the  Viet Cong  In Vietnam 
[03:28:00]  As Indians  Let's be honest  I mean put it primitively  What do you think  Of the Redskins  Name change?  I think it would be  A good idea  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  But yeah  So Kennedy  Had reached a place  Where because of  The missile crisis  He was considered  A soft belly  A guy who could not  Stand up to communism  He was nobody  He was not of the caliber  Of Eisenhower  That was the time  To do this war  Eisenhower told him  To go into Cuba  When they had those  Missile sites in there  And the Russians  Put him in  He said go 
[03:28:30]  All his older men  Dean Acheson  All the people  The wise men  Of our administration  Said go  Go  But we didn't know  What we were headed for  We would have headed for  A hundred thousand casualties  Probably  And they would have  Escalated into a massive  Thermonuclear winter  It would have been  The end of civilization  Of course  But we did not know it then  And Kennedy  We didn't have an idea then  That  No because  We really didn't  Once you start  The nuclear weapon thing  No because  They didn't think  The Soviets had  That kind of weaponry  We were a ten to one 
[03:29:00]  Military superiority  Sure  But still  They had subs  They were crude subs  But they would have  Done some damage  Yeah  And the thing is  We would have attacked  We would have wiped out Russia  We would have wiped out China too  Because that was definitely  In our PSYOP plan  And we had 600 million  Casualties planned on that  I mean  Eisenhower built up this thing  He had been  Eisenhower didn't want to get  Into a conventional war  He wanted a nuclear war  To solve things quickly  He wanted the threat  Of nuclear war  To keep us out of war  But now we'd escalated 
[03:29:30]  Past Eisenhower  To this point  Where we're willing to use  Curtis LeMay  Was the  Air force chief of staff  LeMay had been  The terror bomber  Who dropped  Who wiped out  100 Japanese cities  And civilians were killed  And so forth  He had no compunctions  About not dropping these bombs  It's amazing to me  That this is all  Like  I would think  That a person  To come into an interview  With this kind of information  You'd have to research it  The night before  And figure it out  But this is all just  All these stories  Are just right there for you  Well  Within reason 
[03:30:00]  I mean  Come on  There's a lot of facts  In the book  There are tons of facts  I'm trying to cover this  In a sound bite  You're telling me  Well I'm trying to say  That Kennedy said no  Right  When he said no  This was a huge thing  It was  He  62 was a turning point  And then within a year of that  He was doing a limited  Test ban treaty  With Khrushchev  Khrushchev and he  Were starting to  Moving towards  A detente  Of the Cold War  Which was very crucial  He was moving towards  He said that very famous  Speech Kennedy  Called off the space race  With the Soviets  He said why don't we  Go to space together 
[03:30:30]  He made the peace speech  At American University  He's the first president  Who finally  Finally  After Roosevelt  Recognized the Soviet  Contribution in World War II  Which was to win the war  Basically they took  27 million casualties  Fighting the Germans  So you know  He did a lot  To close the Cold War  Out  He was moving in that direction  And he was stopped cold  In Dallas  On that day  Because he would have  Been re-elected  He was popular  By the way  For having said this  And done this  But what do you think 
[03:31:00]  So you think the reason  That more hasn't been  Made of this  Is because the people  Who are coming forward  With information  Are kind of  Being silenced  Not taken seriously  Well  Let me finish my point  And you'll  Believe it or not  Your questions are  Refining themselves  As you're listening  Well I am listening  But I'm trying  They're in my headphones  Telling me  You have other interviews to do  Okay  I would sit here  With you for three  Fucking hours  If I could  The point is  That there was  We had an interest  In maintaining our superiority 
[03:31:30]  Maintaining the Cold War  Yeah  It's a financial interest  We've had a very strong interest  In going into Vietnam  And staying there  And making  And creating  And fighting communism  On all fronts  Across the world  Which we did  Lyndon Johnson  When he took office  Continued exactly  In the vein  Of Eisenhower  So in other words  The torch went back  To the old men  From Johnson  To Nixon  To Ford  To Reagan  It's more and more  Conservative people  This is where  In the United States  In that brief three years  With Kennedy 
[03:32:00]  Had a shot  To go in another direction  And that was it  That was it  And it was the last one  If you look at it  Clinton had a brief moment  Carter had a brief moment  Obama talked that way  But none of those guys  Have succeeded  In moving the country  When these guys come in  And talk about it  And get you excited  Like maybe he's the guy  That they're told  Something that we don't know  That stops them  Do you think Obama  Has shown something  Behind a door  Yes I do think  A lot of that goes on  I think you're surrounded  As president  With military security  And intelligence  People who are telling you  24 hours a day 
[03:32:30]  Focus on this  Focus on this  There's a threat  From this country  There's a threat  On your life  I mean that's constant  I do think  We have a monster  Shadow government  That we can't control  And I think this NSA thing  With Snowden  And all this stuff  It's out of control  I mean you have to understand  That the more you give  The military  The more you give intelligence  The more they take  And they don't know  The line  There's no end to  What they will do  Well listen  They're yelling at me  In my headphones  Because I'm supposed  To release you  I would talk to you  For hours  I think you're  A fascinating man  I saw you as a hard case  I'm trying to just get you 
[03:33:00]  Thinking in more  In some new directions  Yeah I like it  I like it  I like what you do  Now JFK  50th anniversary of his death  The commemorative  DVD, Blu-ray  Everything box edit's huge  It's in stores on Tuesday  Untold history of the United States  The book and the Blu-rays  Are out now  In the JFK thing  Commemoration  Is chapter 6  Of untold history  The Kennedy chapter  Which is a great chapter  It is a great chapter  So check that out  Oliver  Now let me ask you  Real quick  Are you glad  That you made a sequel  To Wall Street 
[03:33:30]  Yes  You are glad  I do  Okay  Because a lot of people  Were worried about it at first  But I think  The movie went over pretty well  See it again  It shows you Wall Street  In 2010  And the other one  Shows you 1987  There's a contrast  And is the Martin Luther King Jr.  Biopic  Is that happening  Is that the next thing  I can't say it's happening  But I'm writing  Hopefully that's your next move  Yeah  Oliver Stone  Thank you so much  Thank you  We're going to take a break  Sam  And we'll be back  The O&A show continues  Sort of  This is After O&A Live  Stay tuned 
[03:34:00]  Sirius XM  Sirius XM  And now  The Opie and Anthony show  Continues  This is After O&A Live  We have our own  Coming back from break sweepers  We've just never used them  Yeah  I never take a break  Yeah  Holy shit  I'm sorry if you're not  A history fan  I could have  I could have  Talked to him for hours  He is what you call  I mean to me  An easy guess  What did you think of that Eric  That was great  Okay  There was still a lot 
[03:34:30]  That we should have  Got through  Yeah like  I wanted to talk to him  About cocaine  I wanted to talk to him  About Wall Street  I wanted to talk to him  About Platoon  Like Oliver Stone  Is not like  There's a lot of guys  That have been thrown at me  I'm not even going to say  It's a hypothetical  That have been  Thrown at me  That I'm like  I don't know  What to do with this person  But when Oliver Stone  Walks in  It's like  I could have done  Another three hours  With that guy  He has a commanding presence  Yeah and he's smart 
[03:35:00]  He's a guy  A lot of the people  Who come in here  Are dumb people  So it's like  A lot of the actors  And the actresses  And the musicians  When it comes down to it  They're stupid people  So when you're just  Trying to relate to them  As a human being  It's just a void  It's just vapid  You know  There's nothing there  But with Oliver Stone  I swear to God  I felt like I was  Talking to my dad  Like I'm like  Well the question here is  What started the Cold War 
[03:35:30]  And I can't find it  In the chapter  And then my dad  Get the hell out of here  That's how  Like you know  Sixth grade was for me  We get the  Social studies homework  And it says here  That we were fighting  Germany and Japan  In World War II  But  Why don't we  We're fighting the Nazis  And then my dad  Keeps me up  The rest of the night  Talking about World War II  And explaining the whole picture  You're a very weird child  You think so?  No white  That's how 
[03:36:00]  You know  We were taught things  In the house  This book is thick too man  I don't think black people  Gonna read this shit  DJ Who Kid has stopped by  I saw you  It was funny  I saw you right outside  The studio  When Oliver Stone  Was in here  And I was like  I was thinking to myself  Who Kid is welcome  To come in anytime  I'm good  But he will be swimming  In the deep end  And we all know  Black people don't swim  If he comes in here  When Oliver Stone  Is in here  Drowning  But first of all  Like this is like random  And I'm not prepared  Right  Just like you stated  There's like 20 things 
[03:36:30]  You could talk about  So like  Yeah if I'm sitting there  Saying like  So you wrote Scarface  While you were on cocaine  Let's talk about that  Then Who Kid's like  What up  What up kid  But  If I  If Who Kid walks in here  And I'm like  So Eisenhower  Was the first too  Who Kid's like  What the fuck  Did I walk in on  I would be like  Yo who shot that nigga  JFK yo  Tell me son  I know you know  There's no way  He don't know  That's why  And I'm  You know I'm a conspiracy  Like buff  So I didn't want to  Come in here  I'm very scared of like  Cause people like him  They have information 
[03:37:00]  That get people killed  And I don't want  Oliver Stone does  Yeah I don't want to be on the show  And he states something on air  And we all get killed together  Gotcha  Okay so you're saying  Like Eric gets shot  You know  Everybody here is gonna get killed  You're saying Oliver Stone  Knows these secrets  That get people killed  Yo forget about it  You're dead  See I was gonna ask him like  How much responsibility  Because you hear in arguments  When people are saying  JFK was definitely  An assassination  An inside job  Yeah  You hear people argue  Facts that they saw  In Oliver Stone's movie  That are  The driver did it 
[03:37:30]  Yeah but they're dramatized  Yeah  Like Oliver Stone wrote a movie  Like some of the characters  Are based on characters  It's not all  It's not a  It's not a documentary  It's a film  It's a biopic  So  I mean  But what are you gonna believe  The media  Or  Well that's it  But they don't read books  Government cover up  But they don't read like books  They don't do research  They just watch the movie  So I wanted to talk to him  About whether or not  He feels responsibility  For people taking his movie  As facts  I wanted to talk to him  About 9-11  I wanted to talk to  That's 150 things 
[03:38:00]  You can't have him  For 10 minutes though  How long you had him for  But you got a lot  I didn't have him  For enough time Eric  How long did I have him for  You had him for  I feel like it was  Less than 20 minutes  He came in  How long did I have him  For Roland  You had him  Less than 20 minutes  You had him  I mean  16 minutes  20 minutes  My god  Your brain didn't explode  I need  Overload  So you figure this  Is just you  POTUS  P. Dominic  Oh dude  I'm not complaining 
[03:38:30]  It's a huge deal  My god  Next time he's around  Let's do 3 hours  Can you do that for me  You  That's why Charlie Rose  Did like  3 parts  Dude you have to  With that dude  He's got a lot to talk  He can't rush him  Like he said  He got upset afterwards  He's like  Because I needed to  Point  He wasn't  Not at me  He wanted to make a point  About some Libya thing  He said  I could have got him  But why did you rush me  He was upset that  Spencer was rushing him  Out of here to do  His next interview  He was like  Don't you want to get  To the bottom of some 
[03:39:00]  Shit here  Yeah  It's funny  And then  We squeezed in  The Wall Street 2  Yeah I was like  Look  At the end of this interview  We're doing some  Movie questions  Period  Nick in Tennessee  Wow  Prime time  What's up buddy  How you doing  Hey man  You did an exceptionally  Good job today  Considering  How fucking awkward  That started man  He's like  When he walks in  And he goes  Are you Opie  Yeah  And I'm like  What the fuck  This guy doesn't even know  Who he's supposed to be 
[03:39:30]  He walks in  And he goes  Hey I've been here before  And he remembered the room  But he didn't remember the people  So he thought we had spoken  Like he thought last time he was here  We had hung out  And I was like  This is the first time  I've ever talked to you in my life  You're like a legend  And he walked right by me  So by that time  It was like too late  But it feels good to have  Reverse racism 
[03:40:00]  Like white on white racism  That's true  He's stating that  All white people look the same  We don't all look alike  Who kid  You don't look nothing like Opie  Thank you  And I survived  Who kid's driving  So I'm very happy  There is a God  Mike in Canada  What's up buddy  I just watched a two hour documentary  About the JFK and the magic bullet  And all that stuff  They actually deduced that  There was two different bullets fired  One was the full metal jacket  The magic bullet 
[03:40:30]  And they sorted out  How that actually worked  And then the one that actually  Capped Kennedy in the head  Hit and fragmented  Meaning it wasn't a full metal jacket  Military bullet  I can't get into this in 16 minutes  I can't get it done  Even I can't get it done  And we don't want to get killed  Leaving here  But you did your job though  Thanks Roland  Plus I got your box that signed  Oh well that's  That's the most important thing  Isn't it  Yes  Yeah  High five  How long will it take  To kill Roland  If there was an assassination  Attempt on Roland  Done  How many bullets 
[03:41:00]  He's a full bodied individual  So  Eric  How many shots  Do you think  Will take to kill Roland  If he was the president  First of all  They're not going to get him  In one headshot  Oh shit  Second of all  I don't even  Were you born here  Austin, Texas  Okay  Alright  I don't know if you were born in Mexico or not  Okay  Justin in Philly  I can be like Obama  I graduated from Yale  What's up  You didn't  What's up Justin  Yeah first of all  Oliver Stone was kind of a dick to you  But whatever  Good intro  He was a little bit 
[03:41:30]  But you know what  He didn't think it was that  Because  I was trying to be like a little charming  But I think he was like a little put back  When  He was like  You know  This is what we get into  In history  Of the  The untold history  Of the United States  And then I responded to him  Yeah but I don't have 12 hours  Yeah  I think because you're a younger dude  He just wanted to talk down to you  But  I need to  I need to ask a question man  Why  Why are you coming at Fez  Because  I took a clip today  Honestly  I was walking on the street yesterday 
[03:42:00]  Listening to that  Just started laughing  Right  I mean it's funny but  Let me tell you a quick story  When I was in a sleepaway camp  There was this one kid  That was like  Kind of half retarded  And me and my buddy  Convinced him to pee  On this counselor's bed  Because we  What  That's funny  And this kid got kicked out  But he only did it  Because he was half a retard  Right  So when they found out  They kind of came over to us  And they couldn't really get us in trouble  We knew that all along  But they had to explain to us like  Fez isn't retarded  It wasn't the right thing to do  Fez isn't retarded  He's a host of a show here 
[03:42:30]  On Sirius XM  He's a radio legend  And a great guy  And a great guy  He's not  If you get away with it  Doesn't mean you should get away with it  Look  Fez isn't retarded  And  I don't know why everybody thinks  That I'm the  Library of Fez clips  Play that clip again  And then let's have  The discussion of  Okay  Alright Justin  I think that's you making it  Look  Fez had a Fez moment  It was played on the  Opie and Anthony show today  Okay  And that's the whole story  Why are you bullying this guy? 
[03:43:00]  It was funny  There's no bullying  I saw him last night  After the Eminem thing  And he was chilling  Look  He's a chill individual  Yeah he's cool man  I never said he wasn't cool  But some of the shit he says on the air is funny  And then it gets played on the Opie and Anthony show  And that's the end of the story  Better leave him alone yo  God damn  Making me mad  Bob in Texas  Hey thanks for salvaging the snooze test fam  Good god  Good job  Not a history guy huh Bob  Yeah you are 
[03:43:30]  Hey  So based on your assessment of women  You were talking about  Women either have a fat ass  Or they're smart  I'm curious  You know I said that  Hang on Bob  I said that earlier today  Who kid  Okay  Opie and Anthony questioned Kanye West  They said  Okay  If Opie says  People say Kanye West is a genius right  And I said  Yeah  And he said  Well then why did he marry a moron?

[03:44:00]  You could be a genius  And still like a fat ass  And then  You know  Opie was talking about  Kim Kardashian is this big idiot  And I said  You don't need to be smart  And have a fat ass  If you have that ass  Right?  That makes sense  Okay  So go ahead Bob  And that is more interesting  Than Oliver Stone  Stop shitting on Oliver Stone  He's a legend  And he's a very smart man  His passion happens to be history  My passion happens to be  That ass 
[03:44:30]  True  So I'm curious if Jess  Is smart  Or if she has a fat ass  I'll tell you Bob  My wife Jess  She's somewhere in the middle  Okay  She's nice  She's beautiful by the way  Thank you very much Who Kid  You got to meet her over the weekend  She doesn't have the fattest ass  You've ever seen  But she's also not in Mensa  You know what I'm saying  So she's right there in the middle  A nice little round ass  Yeah  And you can still sit down  And have a nice chat with her  I wasn't looking but yeah  You were looking a little bit 
[03:45:00]  And it's fine  That's your wife man  I'm not looking at your wife ass  I appreciate that  But you had a conversation with her right?  Yeah  She didn't strike you as a moron did she?  No I told her that my dick was at my house  But she's cool  Okay  Alright Bob  I'm glad we got that straight  She's hot though  You know  My wife?  I'm happy you got married man  To her?  Yeah  Thank you very much  I appreciate you saying that  Now you Who Kid  And then Who Kid  After the Oliver Stone interview  Who Kid walks in here like  Yo yo  I just had to stand outside  Cause you were talking about all that smart shit 
[03:45:30]  I'm just in here to get a picture though  And then Oliver Stone's looking at him like  Okay what?  Who are you?  And then Who Kid goes  I'm that nigga  He goes  He goes  No  He goes  No  But you ain't gonna have to worry  I know all that conspiracy shit  And I'm going  What?  No but  Yo I don't like  Who Kid just walked up to Oliver Stone  I refuse to hang around with people  That know like  Information that could possibly get you murdered  Let me ask you  Who Kid  Do you think JFK  Was assassinated by the United States government? 
[03:46:00]  Yes  You do?  Like  Definitely  Cause he loved black people  You think that's what did it?  Anyone who loved black people get killed  Is that right?  If he didn't fucking love Chinese  So how did Al Sharpton stick around so long?  Or Russian or  He would have been a riot right now  How did Al Sharpton stick around so long?  I don't know  He's a bobblehead  I don't know  He does look like he's dying  He looks crazy  But you think JFK was an inside job for sure  Cause he liked black people  Yeah they don't care  Like white people don't care about AIDS victims  Like you know  Al Sharpton  Like he looks like he's diseased 
[03:46:30]  Gotcha  So they're like  He's taking care of himself  But if a sexy white guy like JFK  Like gets all the bitches  All the bitches  We're talking Marilyn Monroe shit  That's some real shit right there  But if he fucking says he likes the n word  It's over  Over  Bye bye  Okay I understand  What about 9-11  That's your boy right there  Who?  Mr. Bush  You think that George W. Bush did that?  He did it God  Fuck him  And what  Now what gives you that impression?  Yo  First of all  When that shit was coming down 
[03:47:00]  He was at some fucking school reading  So like come on  What does that mean?  Yeah  He's reading like kid stories  In kindergarten  You know Obama's never read kids a book before?  Not while the buildings are coming down  How would he know the buildings are coming down?  They show that video  Well I  Yo  I can't believe everything you see on TV  But what they showed  Us ignorant black people  Right  The  The secret service agent  Went and told him that  Yo  Shit came down  God  And he's  And ladies and gentlemen  He's like what?  Ladies and gentlemen  I want you all to take note 
[03:47:30]  Of the difference in conversations that just happened  Yes  Before the break  That was Oliver Stone  With me now is DJ Who Kid  From G-Unit Records  That's right motherfucker  Well  George Bush did that shit  That motherfucker  You're out of your mind  You are out of your mind  Alright  One of the conspiracy theories is  I'm ignorant  This is what I see on TV  Right  This is what I see in the media  You see it on YouTube  I'm not like saying that it's a factual situation  Sure  But he owns like you know  All that  Red  You know the colors 
[03:48:00]  The different colors of the alerts  He owns that company  What?  The company that makes colors?  No  What company?  Whatever it is  It's like in the red  Or it's in the yellow  Or whatever  I thought the United States government  Pick what color it is  What color is it  If it's extremely fucked up out there?  Red  Okay  So he owns that company  So  What company?  Everything  Every time something fucked up happens  Yeah  They hire his company to  Fix that shit  Not only to fix it  But to provide security  So you're telling me 
[03:48:30]  All the technical shit  I thought they used  He makes money off that shit  I thought they used  The United States Army for that  No  They don't use the military  They're talking about the digital shit  Like he runs that  Oh  Not the actual slaves with the guns  I think you're talking about the  I mean  I wish  I think you've made me a little dumber  I think  You're talking about the company  That manufactures  Weapons  That  What's his name worked for?  Now we both sound like idiots  I can't get into this with you  By the way  That color thing you're talking about  Go ahead  Is the Homeland Security Advisory System  And he owns it 
[03:49:00]  He owns Homeland Security  He owns that shit  Homeland Security is a function of the United States Government  George Bush's dad is chilling up there drinking some rock  Laughing at us  He's a rock  Andy  Get me out of this  Yes  Thank you  Yeah  I'm gonna tell you this for you  I like watching Who Kid's Eyes  Because you can tell  Hang on Andy  I'm talking shit right now  I love watching Who Kid's Eyes  Because he starts on something  And then I start questioning  And he starts going  Oh shit  I'm in too deep  I'm in too deep  Alright  They just had a documentary  On this whole bullshit 
[03:49:30]  They just called  Oliver Stone  One of the most irresponsible pieces of media  Both 13 Days that he did  And JFK  They set up  They set up this whole thing  They said that  He did the movie 13 Days?  Yes  He did  I didn't know that  Look that up Eric  That's an Oliver Stone movie?  I believe it is  Yeah  It's called 13 Days Eric  Yeah it's about the Cuban Missile Crisis  Yeah it's a great movie  Yeah and the whole thing with that  Sam is that  Kenneth O'Donnell  Who was an advisor to JFK  Right  He played football 
[03:50:00]  At Harvard  He didn't do 13 Days  But go on  Who did?  I'm sorry  Who did the movie 13 Days?  The director is Roger Donaldson  That's what I thought  13 Days is not an Oliver Stone movie  I knew that  That's not kind of weird  Matter of fact  I'm done with you Andy  You can't be spreading misinformation  Like that on this show  Who do you think you are  DJ Who Kid?  Bye bye  I got the real news  Joker in Louisiana  Hey Sam  I just wanted to let you know  That I thought  That that was an awesome job  With this interview  He's a difficult interview  At best

[03:51:30]  When he saw you  What was his impression  Like did he like  Look at you up and down  Well I think especially  After I told him  I'm not Opie or Anthony  Damn  And he was like  So why the fuck  Does your hair look like that  If you're not famous  That's what I think  Was in his head  And then he realized  I was also young  And it was like  Alright  I'm just going to have to  Talk to this guy  About Eisenhower  For the next 16 minutes  Fuck God  Marshall  You're back  I'm sorry  It's alright man  It's alright man  I'm a stupid motherfucker  I know I'm stupid

He's just got young boys  Hanging out in the studio with him now?  You about to touch him?  Well, no  Oliver Stone left him  I'm kidding  Oliver Stone is  He's too busy  Shitting all over Truman  To be worried about any of this stuff  No  This is  Intern Rob 
[03:56:00]  Handsome Rob  How's it going, buddy?  Good  Now a lot of people  May or may not remember  Handsome Rob  Just a couple things  What was your favorite moment  Of your internship?  You interned for the  Opie and Anthony show  How long ago?  It was  Summer of 2012  Summer of 2012  About a year  Almost a year and a half ago  Wow, he's back  But he made an impact  Who, kid?  What was your  Impact moment  Would you say?  My impact moment?  Ah, yes  When  Well, impact moment 
[03:56:30]  Not favorite moment  What moment do you think  Made the most impact  On the people?  I'm not asking you  Oliver Stone questions here  These are much easier  Was he impacted?  Or you mean  Look, this shouldn't be  That complicated of an issue  Okay  No, you mean impacted  I thought somebody fucked him  Get with the question  When I  Dressed up as  A pig  Oh, hell no  Okay, so you  Dressed up as a pig  What did you do?  I threw  Egg McMuffins in the air  Uh-huh  And said I'm nagling it up 
[03:57:00]  Yes, this is intern Bob  Rob  Bob  Who came in one morning  Yeah  It was his last day, I think  Because he had a bad internship  Because Opie and Anthony  Thought he was a liar  Because he invited them  To a pool party  And then when we  Interrogated him about it  On the air  His entire story fell apart  Get the hell out of him  Will you tell me now  If you were lying about that or not?  No, I was gonna have it  But then my brother  Okay  I can't be involved in this  He still lies  All this time later  However  Was he at Anthony's party?  He wasn't there, right?  No  Fuck no  See, the guys got totally 
[03:57:30]  Creeped out by him  When they thought he was a liar  And they stopped talking  To him altogether, correct?  Pretty much  That's crazy  On his last day of his internship  And this is a lesson  For all potential  Opie and Anthony interns  And our current crop  Who are here now  He said  I do not want to leave  This internship on a bad note  And I feel like he didn't  So you know what he did, kid?  What do you do?  He barged into the studio  In the middle of the show  In the middle of the  Opie and Anthony show  Without telling  Opie and Anthony about it  Get the fuck out of here  Wearing a pig suit  Throwing Monopoly money 
[03:58:00]  In the air  And handing Egg McMuffins  Out to everybody  Saying  I'm nagling it  In this bitch  You know what  Nagling it means?  What the fuck is that?  Is that a pig term?  E-Rock's last name  Is Nagel  Oh, hell no  E-Rock, were you happy  About that day?  No  Sorry, Eric  How did E-Rock  Respond to you  After that one?  Oh, it was not good  It was not?  No  Now  How was the review?  Were you reviewing interns  At that time?  Uh, what?  For new candidates? 
[03:58:30]  For him  Oh, for him  Yeah, I never handed in  His final, uh  Review  And I'm especially glad  That I didn't  Because when he decided  To leave the very last day  He decided to come in  To the office  Under somebody else's guide  Saying, um  Go fuck yourself  Wow  And then left  I have no such thing  Did you or did you not  On your last day  Say, Eric, one more thing  Before I leave  Go fuck yourself  I don't think I did  And if I did, I'm sorry, Eric  No, you did  Because the guy 
[03:59:00]  On the other side  Of that console there  Was telling you  It was a good idea  Oh, who kid?  Do not be telling him  Those ideas  Anyway  And then after that  I, uh  Quickly changed his evaluation  What did he get?  Um  Do not hire  Really?  Yeah  Ouch  Sorry, bro  That happens  Life's good?  Life's not bad  Alright, well listen  We gotta let Ron and Fez  On the air now  But I'm glad we were here  To reminisce  With that pig suit  You didn't bring it today?
