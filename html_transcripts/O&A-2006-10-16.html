<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a comedic news report about a fictional "ONA virus" spreading rage.  The hosts then discussed a recent Buffalo blizzard, featuring a caller who recounted drunkenly driving a snowplow.  This segued into a debate about global warming, with the hosts mocking perceived inconsistencies in climate change arguments.  Opie then launched into a lengthy rant about his terrible experience at a Jets game, specifically the nightmare of Parking Lot Y,  with Anthony and guest Patrice O'Neal largely disagreeing, arguing Opie should have arrived earlier.  A supportive listener call reinforced Opie's parking complaints. Patrice then began a story about attempting a threesome with his girlfriend, detailing the complexities and frustrations involved, before the segment was interrupted by a commercial break.  In-studio guests included Patrice O'Neal and Vinnie Brandt.

Following the break, the show continued with Patrice's unconventional relationship philosophy, using a "karate class" analogy to explain his relationship with a lesbian girlfriend and his plans to add another partner – a plan his girlfriend surprisingly supported.  He compared his happiness distribution to trickle-down economics. The conversation, punctuated by frequent interruptions and humorous asides, became sexually explicit, covering threesomes, swing clubs, and casual sex.  Vinnie offered contrasting viewpoints on long-term relationships and marriage.  Listener calls added diverse perspectives on relationships.  The segment concluded with brief discussions of Steve Lyons' firing from Fox Sports and the show's "Fatty Pig Fatty Contest."

A subsequent segment began with a discussion of Steve Lyons' firing, comparing it to other controversial statements by public figures like Rush Limbaugh and Jimmy "The Greek" Snyder (whose racist remarks were played).  The hosts then critiqued Rita Cosby's voice and ranked female news anchors' attractiveness.  An interview with Screech (Dustin Diamond) followed, focusing on his sex tape scandal.  The show also promoted "Tourette's Day" and the "fattest girl" contest, with a caller offering a 541-pound woman as an entrant.  Further discussions with Patrice and Vinnie included jokes about a listener's broken pinky finger,  observations on clothing choices reflecting sports allegiances, racial stereotypes, and a humorous critique of Sting's previous lute performance on the show.  The hosts ended by discussing their lack of preferred soup at the studio.

A segment focused on the hosts' and callers' overwhelmingly negative experience at a Sting concert, particularly criticizing his lute playing and reinterpretations of The Police's songs. Callers shared similar negative experiences with other artists altering their setlists.  A humorous segment involved guessing the meanings of country song titles, highlighting the hosts' lack of knowledge of the genre. A recurring bit involved the phrase "to die," and a fictional radio drama about a "black ninja" was also included. A caller offered to bring his mentally-challenged brother to participate in a football-picking segment.

Finally, a segment featuring Patrice O'Neal and Vinnie Brandt involved guessing the themes of various country songs, employing crude and offensive language, sexually suggestive and violent jokes about lyrics and singers.  The hosts' interpretations centered on sex, death, and relationships, with frequent references to "ass sex" and "poop shoot sex." They made numerous derogatory comments about country music listeners' intelligence.  Brett in Brooklyn and Janet from Boston called in, met with hostility from the hosts.  Vinnie, referred to as "Vinny the family man," expressed discomfort with some jokes. Listener “Cult 45” won “Line of the Day”. The segment concluded with promotion of Bodogfight.com and upcoming television appearances.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony and James Norton.  Right from the beginning you knew this was different.  The infection was everywhere.  It was in the street outside.  It was coming through your windows.  It was a virus.  Terrible viral infection gives people this incurable disease.  Fills their veins and blood with pure rage.  By the time they tried to evacuate the cities, it was already too late.  Jesus Christ, five hours?  It infects, replicates and kills this fast?  These numbers can't be right.  The numbers are correct. 
[00:00:30]  I wish to God they weren't.  It's that one.  There is no God.  It's like some kind of horror movie.  It's such a great virus that you want to infect others like your friends and co-workers.  Sometimes it leaves pustules.  There's nothing you can do about it.  God almighty.  You've got to stop this outbreak before you take it.  They're highly contagious.  What's this rash from?  We're facing a new strain.  It can cause life-threatening bleeding or even asphyxiation.  Where is it spreading?  All over the place.  All right.  We're coming out. 
[00:01:00]  Here we go.  I'm a boredom.  Anthony.  I'm a little dirty.  Wipe me.  James Norton.  Boom.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  What the taser. 
[00:01:30]  What the taser's rule.  It's better. 
[00:02:00]  All right.  Let's run through this crap one more time.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  It's Monday.  Hello, Buffalo.  They dug out yet?  I guess they missed Friday's show.  Are they dug out of the snow yet?  They lost their power in Buffalo on Friday, so they missed one.  You missed a great radio show on Friday. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, probably the best we've ever done.  Yeah.  Yeah, you missed out on that one.  Sorry, Buffalo.  We focused our whole show on Buffalo, then realized that they couldn't listen to us.  They had no electricity.  No.  They're sitting in their houses freezing.  And then when we realized they couldn't hear us, we said, screw Buffalo.  We said, forget it.  And started talking about Chicago and Detroit.  That's what we do.  Plenty of cities to talk about.  I'm sure they're dug out by now, right?  They gotta be.  Right?  You're dug out?  They're professional. 
[00:03:00]  You live there, right?  You live there.  You know how professional they are with plowing themselves out.  I see it right here.  Thought I was lying.  Scott in Buffalo.  What's up?  Dude, I was drinking during a Friday morning, pushing snow with my truck, and I didn't even  have a plow on.  Drinking, driving, pushing snow.  Hey.  Very good.  At 20 miles an hour, what are you gonna hit?  That's Buffalo for you.  Yeah.  Are you dug out?  Yeah.  Everything's pretty much melted except for a lot of water everywhere. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, a lot of water.  All right.  Lots of generators are gone.  People are kind of sticking in there.  And I watched the corner stores.  They sold a lot of ice cream because they were giving it away.  And then most people were just buying beer and heading home.  Who the hell wants ice cream after a blizzard?  Well, it was free.  You kind of got it with the 12, 18, 24-pack that you bought.  Was there any looting?  Did you see someone with a big tub of Heinekens walking through a river?  No.  None of that, really. 
[00:04:00]  It was pretty good.  My favorite looter of all time.  Most snow ever for the month of October for Buffalo.  It was beautiful, dude.  If I had got my snowmobile out, it would have been better.  How do they tie the...  I don't care what he's saying.  I don't know.  How do they tie the global warming into the most snow ever this early in October?  Well, the global warming is happening today when all the ice is melting.  Yeah, see?  See?  I don't get it.  One way or the other.  Because I've heard them use the argument, well, the fact that the Earth's atmosphere is warming 
[00:04:30]  brought this much snow.  Like, they say it's warming, so there's more moisture in the air, so then when you get  a cold blow from Canada off the lake, it gets more...  But you can't have it both ways.  Either it's global warming or it's getting cold.  I don't want to hear both.  I don't want to hear...  Because they use...  Whenever it's too cold or too hot, they use global warming.  Yeah, I just leave it to the scientists.  Whatever.  Scientist schmientist, I say. 
[00:05:00]  I don't believe any of them.  I just think Earth is going to do what it's going to do, where flees on its back.  I still want my hurricanes.  Yeah, we didn't get any hurricanes.  We feel like we got chipped this season.  No hurricanes.  It's supposed to be the big hurricane season this month.  You two millionaires, shut up.  What's the matter?  You want the Earth to stay right where it is.  It's not good.  No, I want my hurricanes.  I don't want it to...  I want it all messed up.  You want excitement and chaos.  I want hurricanes.  I want blizzards.  I want my earthquakes in Hawaii. 
[00:05:30]  Just like everybody else.  Everyone loves disasters.  Get rid of house invasions, but not earthquakes.  Yeah, no home invasions.  No home invasions, but plenty of hurricanes for all.  I don't like what people do.  What this planet does is fantastic.  Wipes out a quarter of a million at a clip just by going like...  A little shake.  The Earth can just go...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There you go.  A quarter of a million people dead.  And it's going to do that.  But people always want to attribute it to something. 
[00:06:00]  They can't just accept the fact that this stupid planet hurtling through space is going  to do as it pleases.  And no matter what we do or don't do as we're sitting on it, it doesn't matter.  It's just going to do it.  There's going to be earthquakes.  There's going to be tsunamis, blizzards, hurricanes, tornadoes.  No, no.  All that crap.  The government's working on weather machines.  That's what it is.  The government will figure out weather.  I'd like to see that.  They're going to finally figure that one out?  What do they throw stuff into the tornadoes to slow them down? 
[00:06:30]  That'd be great if they could because the weather forecast...  You don't think they're working on that?  The government is.  And then there could be a reality show where you get to vote what weather you want that  day.  And the more people that vote, like, I want a sunny day.  I want some rain.  Oh, sun just beat out rain today.  What about the sad people out there?  They would root for a cloudy day.  Or a sunny day to make them feel better.  Yeah.  I think you don't...  Whatever.  So, all we're getting at, Buffalo has dug out.  Who cares?  That's right.  We were talking about stupid Buffalo.  If we start talking about weather, we are lame. 
[00:07:00]  Especially, like, weather that doesn't make sense.  Right.  Let's go to Jay in Cleveland.  Jay.  We don't know crap.  Remember that.  Dinosaurs had weathermen.  See, we didn't know that.  Yeah.  Dinosaurs did everything we did.  Same thing.  Hey, Jay, is it snowing in Cleveland?  Not yet.  Not yet?  No snow yet in Cleveland?  First of all, I got a few points.  First of all, I want to say Cleveland does rock.  Yeah.  Sarcasm, I guess.  I mean, can I say that? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, you can say it.  Wow, we're going to take the listeners out of the show today.  Sarcasm is another dirty word.  No, just Cleveland listeners.  I don't know.  Buffalo is excited.  Buffalo is pretty lame, too.  It's not snowing yet, but it does rock in Cleveland.  All right, we know that.  Let's go.  That's not sarcasm.  I like your Stephen Wright delivery.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Jay, say what you want to say so I can set up what I want to do.  What do you want to do?  I'm using you.  Doesn't it say, let's go Mets?  Excuse me as long as you want.  Yes, it does have to go with go Mets. 
[00:08:00]  Why are you a Mets fan, being in Cleveland?  Because I'm, yeah.  Monday, Monday, blah, blah, blah.  I want to think.  What?  Hey, Patrice, you fat.  Yes.  Monday, Monday.  Jay.  Let's go Mets, girl.  All right.  Okay.  Get back to drinking.  That's not where I'm going.  Listen, give me a hat if I could FedEx you a pistol.  Let's shoot yourself in the face.  Listeners are 0 for 2.  Wow.  By the way, in case you had to go to bed to get up for work, this is what you missed. 
[00:08:30]  Nothing?  One ball, one strike on Rodriguez.  0 for 2 so far in this series.  To the second baseman, Valentin.  Out at second and out at first.  The Mets with a loud victory here in game four.  A 12-5 final.  Two home run night for Beltran.  Home runs by Delgado and Roy. 
[00:09:00]  Boring.  And it's a seven-run victory to even this series at two games apiece.  Look, I know it was kind of a blowout last night, but can you show a little more excitement  there?  Yeah.  Just a little bit?  Help us out a bit?  I know it was a blowout in St. Louis, but there you go.  Mets won last night.  Congrats.  They're still...  I think they're going to win.  I really do.  I think it's going to be Mets.  Do you really?  St. Louis or the whole thing?  No, no.  Not the whole thing.  Oh, okay. 
[00:09:30]  I think Detroit's going to roll right over.  I like baseball, and I know Detroit's going to smack them.  Yeah, Detroit's just a monster.  I'm a huge, huge Mets fan.  I don't have hope with this team at this point.  Tigers all the way.  This series?  You think they'll win this series they're in, though?  Maybe.  Yeah.  We had to go to a pitcher that was 3-13 during the regular season last night.  3-13.  That's right.  Glavin's back on the mound.  The pitching staff's falling apart.  Everyone's injured on the Mets.  Very injured.  If we even make it to the World Series at this point, I'll be really, really happy. 
[00:10:00]  But then it's just luck.  Like, Detroit's just been rolling over everybody, but then they could just have, like, a bad couple  of days.  It's all it takes.  Baseball's so stupid that way.  We were talking about that.  It just doesn't matter.  Any sports like that, they're all the same thing.  Yeah.  You could be, it doesn't matter.  Worst team is going to beat the best team at some point.  Detroit's going to win this off.  They were hot in the beginning.  They're hot now.  Well, that's obvious, yeah.  I want the Mets to lose.  I don't mean to.  It's all right.  The Tigers are looking really, really good, and the Mets are just kind of, their wheels 
[00:10:30]  are falling off as the days go on here.  I'm just, like, hanging there, guys.  Just hanging there.  Come on, you're champs.  Gotta believe you're amazing.  Shut up.  Yeah, man.  When you have to start a guy that was 3-13 in the regular season, you know that there's  problems.  Yeah.  There's some late season problems.  There's some late season problems.  Throw him in there.  Anyway.  All right.  I went to the Jets game yesterday.  I want to say hi to everyone we met at the Jets game.  I took Than.  Oh.  Oh, you took Than, did you? 
[00:11:00]  I haven't got.  What kind of special gift was that?  Wow.  Yeah.  What did you do to deserve that, Than?  Oh, I'm sure.  That's the praise that then goes along.  Go get Opie his hot dogs and his pretzels.  Sissy.  Yeah.  I just want to call him something else.  I can just picture what was going on.  And you snap and go, hey.  Not at all.  You're telling him, soon as old Butter Arm threw a long pass.  Oh, Butter Arm.  Go get me a dove bar there, punk. 
[00:11:30]  Not at all.  You know, the slap on the snout with the newspaper doesn't mean anything unless you give him a  treat occasionally.  As the Jets do something good and Than touches Opie and he looks at him up and down like,  come on, man.  I didn't bring you here for this.  Yeah, don't touch me.  I'm going to put your filthy hands on him.  I'm certainly no treat to hang out with.  I'll be the first.  Kenny was unavailable.  I did call Kenny.  Yeah, I did.  Did he buy you a foam finger there, pumpkin puss?  I actually called Kenny.  He would have called you from the snack bar. 
[00:12:00]  He called you a seat.  G.H., do you want the Golden's mustard or the yellow on your hot dog?  Because there's a choice of both here.  And I'm confused as to which one you would need.  Golden's.  Golden's it is, G.H., back in a flash.  That would be like his whole job during the game, watching it on that little TV over the  snack bar.  Just waiting on line the whole game. 
[00:12:30]  I think that's probably why I called Kenny, to go to the game.  Secretly, I was hoping he would do all the waiting on line for me.  What choice was Tham?  Be honest.  Let's see.  Tham was, yeah, really.  My chick said no.  The Philly, the people that came up from Philly.  You asked your girl first.  Oh, yeah.  And then there were extra tickets for the Philly crew.  They had one extra.  They couldn't find anyone to go.  And then I called my brothers. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, Jesus.  They couldn't go.  Jesus, Tham.  And then Opie didn't even call me directly.  Kenny called me saying, Opie would like to speak to you.  Oh.  You know what, Tham?  G.H. is requesting your presence at the Jets game.  This is a huge honor and privilege that you should accept.  This is a favor he is doing.  Now, someday, and this day may never come, Opie may ask you for a favor.  No.  I did call Kenny. 
[00:13:30]  Kenny said he couldn't go.  And then I asked Kenny to call you because I didn't have your number.  And it was just easier at that point for him to call.  I don't know why I don't have your number.  I've already had it.  Do you even hear yourself?  I'm not trying to fend myself.  He used Tham as an Ottoman.  That's what he said.  He bought him a jersey that said Ottoman.  No, no, no.  That's not.  He's the second star in left guard, Ottoman.  And he's just like, get on your knees so I can put my feet on you.  Taste his hot dog first. 
[00:14:00]  He's just not poisoned.  I got some shifty-eyed guy working the snack bar.  I hope he used him as one of those Roman juice people.  The taster.  The royal taster.  Tham was the 75th choice.  Wow.  Did you enjoy the show, the game?  Great seats.  Yeah.  Tham and I realized we don't really have much to talk about.  That's a shame.  Actually, it was a good time, but.  A few beers?  Not really.  One or two, but. 
[00:14:30]  One.  Tham?  Oh, yeah.  One.  Because they closed the, they stopped selling beer pretty early.  They stop at halftime?  I hate that now.  They stop at halftime or a little after halftime.  They actually get security guards to end the line, so you can't even sneak on the line real  fast.  Because I guess they were getting away with that for a while.  Yeah.  Where, you know, all right, they have to end the beer sales a little after halftime,  but, you know, the guys are going to sneak you a couple.  Come on, man.  Well, that's directly attributed to some jackass that had to get completely loaded, drive home 
[00:15:00]  and kill someone on the way home from the game.  And then the family sued the stadium.  Right.  Won.  So now you get your beer cut off.  Oh, it's always one person.  The second pass of the game, your beer gets cut off.  Yeah, it's always one person that ruins it for everybody else.  Yeah.  That's always the case.  Jets fans ain't bad, though.  No, it was a Giants game when that happened.  Yeah, yeah.  But, you know, it's the same stadium, so they just got to figure they got to.  I haven't been.  No one could drink.  I haven't been to a Jets game in four or five seasons now.  It is so not worth going there. 
[00:15:30]  How is Noodle Arm?  Is he still doing?  What is he doing?  He did all right.  The defense collapsed once again.  They stink.  That arm is all the way up.  But it was so not.  Fan, stay there because I'm going to need your help with this.  Oh.  Is that how you treated him at the game?  Stay there, boy.  The line's really long here at the – stay there.  Do they sell whips at the consensus there?  It is so not worth going there for a game unless you leave at, like,  nine o'clock in the morning for a four o'clock game. 
[00:16:00]  That's what tailgating started.  It wasn't the fun of hanging out.  It was that you didn't want to wait on line.  Living in Manhattan, you could pretty much see the stadium.  You could pretty much – there's a little hill on the way.  That's about it.  But you could pretty much see where you're going.  You get up a few floors in the building.  You'll see it.  What time we leave?  Like, around three, right on the nose?  Yeah.  We left at three.  It's a 15, 20-minute ride.  We're outside the stadium.  I could practically touch the stadium.  I'm on a little line to get in the parking lot.  What time is that, at 3.15, 3.20?  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  Let's call it 3.15, okay?  It's an official time checker, too.  Yeah.  So –  You can't have anybody in that car.  No, but listen to this.  So we get online.  We wait about 15 minutes to pay our $15 to get into the parking lot, right?  That's what I thought.  And I'm, like, looking at them, like, we're all happy at this point.  I'm like, cool.  It's a great day for football.  We're here kind of early.  We can walk around the parking lot, check out the festivities, see what's going on.  We're meeting people.  We'll meet up with them.  We'll have a beer, a little tailgating.  Nice.  Maybe throw the football around, right?  Throw the football around. 
[00:17:00]  So I pay my $15, and now I'm on an access road for the next hour and 15 minutes.  You want to kill someone.  Dude, by the time we parked, I was like – if I wasn't meeting other people because I had all the tickets that Tom Chiasana gave me,  I would have just said, let's just go home.  Let's just go home and catch the game at a bar somewhere.  But, I mean, you left at 3 o'clock to see a 4 o'clock game.  That's the kind of idiot that causes that bottleneck.  If you had left earlier –  Oh, good point.  It is because that's – 
[00:17:30]  No, I was – no, I was there at 3.15 paying my money to get into the stadium.  With 79,000 other people.  So – no, the parking lot – the parking lot was already packed, okay?  So we were on an access road for over an hour.  We ended up parking in parking lot Y.  Now, I'm guessing –  Parking lot Y is –  I'm guessing A is the closest.  Yeah. 
[00:18:00]  Y is the letter next to Z.  Dude, they had to make up parking lot Y.  Did you take a bus?  Did you have to take a bus?  Well, hold on.  Let me get to the end of this story.  Parking lot Y is freshly made.  I don't know what the hell is going on over there, but parking lot Y.  They're building it as you're pulling in.  It's right next to parking lot Indian letters.  Scribble, dibble, four dots.  So this is the first time I'm hanging out with Than, you know, kind of socially, so I don't want him –  Will you stop –  So I don't want him to see that I'm an ass. 
[00:18:30]  I'm a complete ass.  So I'm trying to play it nice, right?  We know you treated Than like garbage.  Stop making a disclaimer every five seconds.  I'm in –  Say, Than, I tickled Than on the way there.  Dude, I'm going to throw myself under the bus, but what I'm trying to say is I'm like, all right, you know, I could probably use some new friends.  I'm hanging with Than.  You know, I can't show him my real side.  So we're in this traffic.  I'm still happy.  We're watching – listening to the pregame show.  And we're just stuck in this traffic over an hour.  I start rolling down the windows, and I can't take it anymore. 
[00:19:00]  And I just start yelling, when does this end?  Because I'm in a line with everybody else.  Everyone is miserable because we're like, where are they taking us?  Because I was right next to the stadium.  By the time we parked, the stadium was just this little thing way in the distance.  You get further and further away.  Way in the distance.  So, again, I rolled down the window.  Yeah, because there would be parking guys waving people around.  And so, Ope, some people sort of drive up and say, hey, where is this going? 
[00:19:30]  Ope just drives by at 20 miles an hour, yells, when does this end?  And as they're trying to answer, he continues to speed away as they shout at his moving car.  Because it wasn't about the answer.  I mean, you can understand that much, right?  He may have known you were an ass when you had the fifth or sixth person that said, no, they couldn't go to the game.  Call them.  Call them and ask.  At that point, sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  So.  What?  Well, it's just that you said you didn't want to say you're an ass.  You asked nine people to go to the game, and then you finally ask him. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, no.  Yeah, he already knows that much.  Everyone knows that much.  Yeah.  They know their place.  Yeah, it's their self-esteem.  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  It's as low as it needs to be.  Stan doesn't care if he was the hundredth person to ask.  He was going to the jet game.  That's all he cared about in the end.  God bless you.  So then we get into parking lot Y, and then we have to go to the back of parking lot Y.  I think we're officially in another state at this point.  And then everyone's looking around like, well, how do we get to that stadium that is now a little speck in the distance?  Like, oh, we're going to bust you in. 
[00:20:30]  So you pay $15 for the privilege of being bust into where the game's at.  It's now 4.15.  The game has begun.  I was there at 3.15.  And then as we're walking toward the stadium, there was a line of cars still trying to get into this parking lot Y,  and everyone is just over the top, miserable, honking their horns, just pissed off.  You're right, though.  They can't believe it.  You've got to get there two hours at least earlier.  It's like a frigging airport now.  But then if you get there two hours early, you can't get out. 
[00:21:00]  It's three hours to get home.  Yeah, then you're stuck by the stadium, and everybody else is trying to leave.  Right.  Well, you know, I think if you get there 3.15, it's not crazy to think you could park in 45 minutes.  No, no, because everyone's there already.  Dude, the parking lot was packed.  Just about everybody was there.  Yeah, that's why you had to park 18 billion miles away.  This was probably the last 15 to 20,000 people going to the game is what it comes down to.  The moral of the story is what?  There was just leave at 12. 
[00:21:30]  Leave at noon and tailgate.  No, dude, if I was the only one going into the stadium at 4.30, missing pretty much the whole first quarter, then it's my fault.  I get that.  But if you've got a sea of people that are just still marching into the stadium and still a huge line of cars waiting to get into this parking lot Y.  I'm sure it goes up to parking lot Z.  Why stop at Y?  And then AA.  Then it's not my problem at that point.  It means that the stadium is effed up, and they need to figure out how to make this easier for people. 
[00:22:00]  Wait a minute.  There's 50 other thousand people who's saying, get in with them.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  Like, do you hear what a mech-o-mech you sound like?  No, I'm sorry.  I'm not accepting that.  If you're at the stadium an hour before the game, that's plenty of time for you to be able to get to your seat.  Hold on.  By game time.  Obviously, it's not.  I'm not talking.  Dude, I'm not talking.  I got there at 3.45.  I was there an hour before game time.  I can't touch the stadium. 
[00:22:30]  It was out my window to the right.  Still not good.  Listen, you're passion right now.  You're nuts.  You guys are nuts.  But you said it yourself.  I'm sticking up for the-  Let me say something.  I'm sticking up for the regular Joe, you asses.  You said it yourself.  Because even Ben looks at me and goes, holy shit, can I talk for a minute?  Go ahead.  You weren't in traffic for an hour and a half.  I'm saying.  And two and a half hours of the way home.  I'm a little acidity this morning.  You said the parking lot was full.  So obviously, those people are in watching the game. 
[00:23:00]  When did they get there?  Dude, he's not going with the logic.  I can feel it.  No, dude.  He's just anti-logic right now.  They are the lunatics that get there at 9 in the morning with full-  They brought their whole living room, taking up three or four spots,  because I figured it out on the way out of there.  Why are they lunatics?  Because they did what they had to do.  Look, the tailgating is getting out of control.  When you've got satellite TV in the parking lot and couches and-  Big screens.  Yeah, they pull out the big screen TVs on the tailgates. 
[00:23:30]  And massive 20-foot grills.  You know, these are all parking spots for someone like me and Thann.  Don't be trying to add sanity.  I was poor Thann.  Right, Thann?  I'm with Hope.  You guys are nuts.  Shut up.  Hope, you wrote Thann.  You didn't go to the game.  You wrote Thann's back from wide to the-  Give him a piggyback.  Yeah!  Come on, you!  Yeah!  Come on, kid.  Oh, damn.  Everyone's saying, no, it's not plenty of time. 
[00:24:00]  But what I'm trying to say, if you were there an hour before the game,  and we're not on a massive line, we're pretty much in what is the parking lot  after we paid our $15, I'm saying that the stadium has a problem.  They need bigger roads to go to the crappy parking.  No, I understand what you're saying.  Obviously, I need to get there earlier, because I didn't make it to my seat,  and I missed pretty much the whole first quarter, even though I got there at 315.  The game started at 415, by the way, not 4.  So I get it.  I personally should have got there earlier.  But if they're having this problem, and I wasn't the last person in, 
[00:24:30]  there were people that didn't even get to their seats until way into the second quarter,  then the stadium has a problem.  They've got to figure out what to do.  Wider roads to parking lot Y.  Access road for an hour, bumper to bumper, not even moving,  just slowly inching along, that's a problem with the stadium.  Thank God they have such smart people waving you on to the parking sites, too.  You pay $15 for the privilege of getting on a bus for the mile and a half back to the stadium.  That's how far this parking lot Y is. 
[00:25:00]  It's on the other side of the racetrack, way on the other side of the racetrack,  if you know the area.  So then on the way out, I'll get it then.  I was going to, this is sort of maybe what I was trying to say,  but shouldn't there be a way for somebody who's a fan,  who's willing to get there early, but not spend the entire day in the parking lot  to still, you know, somewhat efficiently get to park for the game?  No.  So I'm stupid to think that, you know, I'll get there an hour early,  an hour before game time, and I'm not going to be able to get to my seats in time for the kickoff? 
[00:25:30]  How long do you take?  Apparently not.  Wait, wait, how long do you think, just off the cuff,  how long do you think it takes for each person as you go into a game?  Yeah.  In a, what, 70,000?  That's a lot of people.  How many?  One minute.  Wait, 30 seconds.  30 seconds.  That's 35,000 seconds you have to deal with.  I don't even know what that means.  See.  But get there.  If you guys were in my situation, it's, it's.  We've been in that situation.  Have you been there?  When was I time to go to a game there? 
[00:26:00]  Not a game, but life.  I went to Star Wars 2.  I drove to Yankee Stadium, and I had to park so far away and walk through Deathville.  I get the life thing.  I get it.  Trust me.  I went to an Islander game on Saturday night, and same thing.  I get there about an hour early.  Well, you can get there about 10 minutes early.  Well, yeah.  I mean, they didn't even sell out their home opener, which is pretty.  They couldn't start the game without you.  You were goalie.  So then really fast on the way home, which, you know, you could see Manhattan from the parking spot. 
[00:26:30]  You really can.  That's where Y was.  It was so, it was like right across the river.  It's no more than 10 miles back to Manhattan.  Two and a half hours.  Two hours?  Two hours to get home.  Oh, my God.  Just leaving the parking lot was another.  I mean, yes, it's a crowded place and a lot of people trying to leave.  But hold on.  And really fast?  Sure.  Because it was a blowout, but then Miami came back at the end.  But by the time Miami started coming back, you know, half the stadium just was gone.  You have to start going, all right, let's get out of here. 
[00:27:00]  Well, they did.  And I'm thinking, okay, you know, we're not going to have that much of a problem.  I want to stay to the end.  And, you know, half the people were gone by the time we got back to our car.  And we had to walk the mile and a half back to, you know, parking lot wide.  But you guys think this is completely logical, which is insane to me.  But anyway, go ahead, man.  But the parking lot is organized.  There's absolutely no dividers in it.  So it's a parking lot with probably, I don't know, 300 cars in it and one exit, two cars wide. 
[00:27:30]  So what you end up with is kind of a Japanese fan of 15 different lanes of self-made traffic trying to get out this two-car wide space.  Oh, no one lets anyone in like it matters.  It's one of those massive fences that you can just, it's on wheels and slide it all the way open.  But, you know, why slide it all the way open when you got an empty parking lot?  Why?  When it's so much more fun to have only enough space for possibly two cars.  They do that on purpose.  So what you get at the end is like everyone just inching forward for about 45 minutes, even though I'm like 100 feet from the exit. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  And inching, inching.  And then you get to the point where you could maybe leave this and you realize what really is going on.  Everyone is crunching each other's cars at that point.  My front bumper is so effed up it's not even funny.  Banging into each other?  Yeah, people just crunching into each other because they're all trying to, you know, converge at the same time.  One guy's knocking the fence open more, you know.  Good for him. 
[00:28:30]  He just took out the side of his car with the whole fence because that's the only way he could make a right turn from where he was.  If it's your front bumper, that was messed up.  That's you doing the bumping.  No, the guy actually cut in front of me.  Vinny's just trying to beat me up.  Good luck, Vinny.  We'll play today.  Trust me.  No, I'm not trying to.  We'll have some fun.  I go to the stadium all the time.  You've got to go two hours early.  It doesn't make any sense.  What you're saying is that you should be able to walk in at the last hour.  I'm not trying to pick on you.  Not to laugh.  Yeah.  No, I didn't expect. 
[00:29:00]  Well, it's stupid to me.  I did expect that if I'm there at 315, I'll be in the parking lot by 330, 340, enough time to hang.  Yeah, that's stupid probably.  But to think that I'm not going to get to my seats by the time they kick off, you know, do the kickoff is ridiculous.  And that's a problem with the stadium.  I'm sorry.  But I don't know.  I think you're talking as a guy who's not a faithful goer to these games.  So, okay, I understand that maybe realistically, okay, I'm going to leave two hours early.  It takes 15 minutes.  I'm there an hour early. 
[00:29:30]  In reality, maybe, you think.  But I think everybody who goes to football games will tell you to shut up.  Nah.  No way.  I know I'm sticking up for a lot of people because when we were walking, you saw all those people in their cars just miserable.  Like, what is this about?  Yeah.  None of these people.  And they were – look, I haven't been to a game in five years.  These guys, they're all dressed in, you know, in their Jets garb and stuff.  These people are used to going to the game.  So, something – I guess they're building a new stadium there or whatever, right?  So, they broke construction.  These people in their cars, you could tell, were like, what is going on? 
[00:30:00]  This is not normal.  So, eh, whatever.  Go after yourselves.  I'm not sharing nothing.  I'm just sitting there going, there's no one agreeing with them except for –  Poor Sam.  Just call me left, dog.  Yeah.  That's what you're looking for.  And Sam's looking at me going, you know –  Come here, Sam.  Sam's pretty much looking at me like, you know who you are, right?  Like, why aren't you, like, trying to, like, go on a VIP passing and stuff?  Oh, hang on.  I never think of this crap.  I'm like – we probably could have, like, parked –  Yeah, when you get the goddamn tickets next time, ask whoever gave them to you for their VIP parking because they got that too. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  That would have been nice.  They got that too.  It's right near the entrance.  Right.  That would have been nice, but –  I told Opie should have just brought –  And, you know, sometimes I park in a VIP if I go to, like, a Nets game.  I don't have one.  You just say hello to the guy with a –  Hey, how you doing?  $40 in here.  And you see you grease him.  You grease the parking guy, and you will get a spot.  All right.  We're late already, so why don't we take a break?  Patrice O'Neal sitting in today.  Oh, yeah.  Where's Jim Norton?  In Cuba?  He's in Cuba. 
[00:31:00]  All right.  He'll be back tomorrow.  He really is.  He's in Cuba.  He's playing in Guantanamo.  Yeah.  How un-Cuban does he look?  Oh.  That little white –  He had a flying on a military transport plane.  Yeah.  We'll talk about that after break because we're real late.  And we got Vinnie Brandt from the Stress Factory in studio today, the owner of the fine comedy club that I love, the Stress Factory.  Sure.  In New Brunswick, New Jersey.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A uncut and live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern. 
[00:31:30]  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  The phone number 1-866-313-3.  Let's say hi to Bob in New Jersey.  Bob, what's up?  Hey there, Bab.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, Bob.  How you doing, man?  All right.  I am a faithful game-goer.  I go up to the stadium at least twice a month. 
[00:32:00]  Parking lot Y is part of the racetrack.  Part of the racetrack.  Yeah.  So why am I paying $15 to be in a parking lot that's part of the racetrack to be bussed back to the stadium?  I don't know.  You spend that extra $10, you get the premier parking, and you're good.  See, I don't know any of this stuff.  I'm not a season ticket holder.  I was lucky enough to get a few tickets for the Jet game yesterday, and I thought it would be an enjoyable experience. 
[00:32:30]  Instead, it was kind of a nightmare.  Kind of a nightmare.  And these guys are like, oh, that's just how it is.  I'm here to say it shouldn't be like that.  Oh, no, it's not like that.  It is an experience.  The same people that talk about, you know, just trying to get out to Long Island from Manhattan.  Oh, that's just how it is.  I say that it shouldn't be like that.  And we should maybe as a society try to figure out how to make things better.  That's what shoulders and sidewalks are for.  Get around traffic, my friend. 
[00:33:00]  If you're going to a Jet game, they should try to take care of the customers, is what I'm saying.  Wow.  You shouldn't pay $15.  Pretty idealistic.  You shouldn't.  Well, I know.  That's stupid in this day and age that people would actually try to take care of the customer.  This day and age.  But, I mean, you know, you pay $15 to park in a parking lot that's parking lot wide to be bused back to the stadium.  They don't give a crap about the customer.  They don't give a crap about the commuter, you know, when you're trying to get out to Long Island.  Those roads are a nightmare.  But no politician in the world is going to take on that as an issue. 
[00:33:30]  Can I ask you something real quick?  What?  Can I ask you something real quick?  Yeah.  If you had to got in very fast, maybe they said, oh, that's Opie.  That's Opie.  Come on in.  Got in.  Everybody got in.  Your family, friends.  Everybody just got in.  Yeah.  Would you be concerned about the other people?  Because all of a sudden it's us and the people.  And we the people.  All of a sudden you got on a white wig and wooden teeth and it's all about us. 
[00:34:00]  At that point it'd be screwing up.  Screw all y'all.  I'm trying to figure out, would you see other people suffering and care?  Honestly, I would have enjoyed myself a lot better, a lot more yesterday.  But I would have had the same observation.  It's just nuts over there.  That's all.  That's all.  That's all I'm saying.  And I just hate the people to say, well, that's just how it is.  You got to leave at 7 in the morning for a 4 o'clock game at the Meadowlands.  Everyone knows that.  Well, I'm here to say that's BS and they should try to make it a little nicer for the customer.  But what would.  That's paying over $100 for a ticket, paying for $20 for a freaking beer. 
[00:34:30]  All right.  What's some kind of a solution?  I don't think there's any way to make it better.  How about this?  You don't charge $15 to get into parking lot.  And you tell the people, look, you're going to be parking pretty far from the stadium and we're going to have to bust you in.  So we're going to we're going to waive the $15.  How about that?  That takes care of the customer and makes it like, all right, this sucks.  But all right.  That was kind of cool that they're trying to at least look after me.  Look out for me. 
[00:35:00]  That's all.  Maybe everything after T could be free.  Yeah.  See anybody who's from T to Z.  Some like that anyway.  And they got there late.  So they don't have to pay.  And then some thrifty people might just park there to save some money and leave the spaces open for the people that are willing to 15 to grease.  By the way, I grease now for everything.  Everything.  By the way, everything I friggin reach into my pocket.  You hit you slip someone some money.  You're getting better service.  Look, today. 
[00:35:30]  I grease the guys at Giants Stadium.  At Yankee Stadium, I've greased successfully.  Giants Stadium, I could never.  It doesn't matter.  I've offered a guy 50 bucks VIP.  Really?  Could not get it.  Today, I'm the average man.  And the average man can't be greasing palms.  They can't afford to.  Yes, the average man.  The palms.  You know what?  The average man just paid $100 to see this awful team.  Every man.  And $4 million for a cup of noodles.  $10,000 for a pretzel.  He can afford $15 in grease.  A little grease. 
[00:36:00]  I lost a guy because you guys are ganging up on me.  He goes, I've had season tickets for three years.  I gave him up because of exactly what Opie's talking about.  He just couldn't take it anymore.  Getting in and out of that place.  Who was that?  Curtis Martin?  Nah, he hung up.  He was good.  I know, right?  He was going to help me out, but he's gone, unfortunately.  Hey, so I'm a little tired today.  And I kind of brought this up with Patrice before the show.  And then Patrice said that he's really tired today as well.  And your story is much more interesting than my horse, S.  What? 
[00:36:30]  With the argument with the, are you allowed to go there?  Yeah, I could go there.  With the chick and all that?  Yeah, I could go there.  I definitely could go there.  Well, just tell people why you're a little tired today.  Well, me and my, I don't know if it's so fresh and it's so real, too.  It's so fresh.  It's still fresh.  It's fresh.  Brand new stuff.  Yeah, because you know, I've been trying to, my pickup line now is to any chick I go,  look, me and my girlfriend are not seeing anybody.  That is an interesting way to put it. 
[00:37:00]  Me and my girlfriend, just to open line, me and my girlfriend are single.  And what I'm trying to do, I'm just trying to stay, if this even sounds right, faithful.  Mm-hmm.  By, like, look, she's into that.  So I'm just trying to, what I did is, like, what happens is anybody out there who's trying  to get into threesomes, the protocol is that your girlfriend or your wife, she solicits  women.  Mm-hmm.  And if y'all want to do a little train thing with your wife, you solicit the guys.  Because what's happening is when she's soliciting the women, she's realizing how dumb women 
[00:37:30]  are.  Like, how, like, she's a trooper.  But she goes and goes, I want to, other women must be like me.  And women treat her like they treat a dude.  Like, hey, how you doing?  She's like, hey, I'm pretty, and would you like to?  And they go, I don't know.  And she realized, like.  And you would think it would be easy, because she's a girl.  Because she's a girl.  Yeah.  And she's starting to realize how annoying women are in terms of sex.  So, basically, I met a chick, like, five months ago and put a little work in. 
[00:38:00]  Now, we only talk, like, three times.  But the first time I met her, I'm like, hey, look, why don't you come on with me and my  girl?  We're single.  Blah.  She's like, I can't.  But she'll call me on the phone.  And my girl got mad, because why does this girl have your number?  But I give my number out all the time.  Like, if a chick, I'm very accessible.  If people know me, I'm really, a lot of people got my number.  So, it's like, I say, here, you need to call me.  Call me and find out when I, you know, work next.  What happens is I then talk to this chick, and I say, look, she finally gives in a little 
[00:38:30]  bit.  I say, go to my girl's job and.  Oh, my God.  There's so many problems with this story writing, man.  Go to your girl's job.  I say, look, go to my girl's job and just go in and meet her.  Because I understand, like, if you wanted me to sleep with you and you had a boyfriend,  and I'd be like, ugh, some strange dude.  And then I would want to meet the dude and say, okay, this dude's cool. 
[00:39:00]  I would knock your wife up.  Right?  Right.  So, I said to the girl, I said, you know, it'd be cool for you to go and see her down  her job.  My girl's a trooper.  I'd call my girl to say, hey, look, somebody's coming down to check you out, you know, and,  you know, see if you like her.  So, it was on.  She almost got fired from her job because she went down and said she just went bananas.  So, we're arguing and trying to make sense of it all.  And I'm telling her, look, if we're going to do a threesome, which we want to, we can't 
[00:39:30]  keep buying hookers.  We're trying to find.  What I'm trying to do is big love.  You seen that show?  That's what she's afraid of.  See, she likes to hook us because it's like, bam, beat it, whore.  But I'm trying to get a square broad to be our girlfriend.  And I'm like, look, if I take you shopping, listen, baby, if I buy both of y'all panties,  I'm going to buy you four and her two.  You know what I mean?  Right.  Just to keep.  You're still a little better than she. 
[00:40:00]  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Like, I'm going to keep.  She's going to be.  And I told her, I said, look, you are our girlfriend.  And when people ask you, do you have a, you say, no, I don't have a boyfriend.  I have a couple.  And you are treading on some dangerous ground.  But by the end, logic wins, man, because she, she can't do it because she keeps playing  around because she's frustrated about how dumb women are.  And she thinks that since I set up the situation, that this opens up more for me to be spending 
[00:40:30]  time with this girl.  But I'm like, even if you bring a chick in, I could spend time with this girl.  So finally, I end up telling her, look, I don't see other women.  If I wanted to, first of all, I sent the broad down there to you.  Oh, well, of course.  That makes you the gentleman.  Makes you the perfect gentleman in this whole thing.  Oh, well, it's all in the open.  This is fine.  Oh, man, listen to me, man.  I sent the broad down there.  I sent her down.  We all understand what you're saying, but we also understand why the girl's not going 
[00:41:00]  to accept what you're saying.  My girl should be more understand.  It's like we're a team.  Look, the bottom line is, your girl, you're getting 100% more girl.  She's getting 50% less guy.  Absolutely not.  That is just the way it works.  And four panties compared to two is not going to keep her happy.  By the way, at least 50% less guy.  That's the best she can do. 
[00:41:30]  Normally, it's probably going to be 25, 75, 75 to the new chick.  You know what it is?  Me and her get 50% more love for each other.  For each other?  And our relationship gets 100%.  So we're up 200% because me and her are going to love each other 50% more just because the  excitement and the thing.  And this girl gets 100% of a couple. 
[00:42:00]  This is our girlfriend, man.  She's going to hang out.  So you're looking for a longer term thing with the same different girl.  So instead of hookers or some one night stand thing, you could call her up or she could call  you and go, hey, let's go out and then we'll all go back.  Or maybe they become friends.  And the thing is, what if I like her?  She says, what if I like her more than you?  I'm like, what?  That'd be great.  If they both dumped you, that would make me so happy.  You know what?  You suck.  Like, why are we with this guy? 
[00:42:30]  We love each other.  We love each other.  But then they'll just be walking around like two fruitcakes with their heads bobbling.  No guidance.  You're the runner.  Hey, Ope, I know it's, I didn't expect to tell the story.  But Ope, man, I'm saying she thinks, I said, look, and this is to your girl, your girl.  I don't, I don't get, I can get another girl if I feel like it and there's nothing you  can do about it.  But the problem is. 
[00:43:00]  To protect yourself.  So your girlfriend is mad that you were talking to this girl on the side, even though you were  talking to her on the side to set up the threesome.  Yes.  And you feel like your girlfriend should understand that.  Because two guys, right?  If she was, if she was in the vein, like, because she is.  What do we all want to live in Patrice's world?  I mean, Patrice's world is just a special place that it's way out.  You got it.  You need a passport to get there.  It's far away.  You need to live in Utah.  You got to take some connecting flights. 
[00:43:30]  Or some third world country somewhere where you're the king.  Get your shots.  It's just so far away.  Ope, the only thing, the only thing she was mad at is the idea that this girl would get  attention beyond her.  Like, all of a sudden, I'm walking around with this girl, which we're eating by ourselves.  That isn't a viable concern of hers?  Yes, but everything is a viable concern.  And I'm telling her, have faith that it ain't going to be.  Because why would I send this girl down there to exercise the faith in the threesome? 
[00:44:00]  I send her to her.  I said, go to see this girl.  I love how he's putting so much credence in that.  Oh, yeah, he gets so mad.  Like, why doesn't this dumb broad understand this?  Patrice, do you understand?  Really?  You sound exactly like Opie's parking lot story to everybody.  And I'm talking about stupid parking.  No one's agreeing with you.  I'm just, well, we understand, but we also. 
[00:44:30]  Right.  It is very similar to what I'm talking about.  Look, all I want to do is get into parking lot B.  He's justifying it by saying, look, I sent you.  I sent her over there.  Yeah.  You know, so the honesty is there.  The you're being very forthright with this.  You could you could just go out and cheat.  I could just I could I could easily, easily because this girl likes me, man.  I could easily just go.  I don't have a girlfriend or my girlfriend.  She's on the way out. 
[00:45:00]  And I could just schmooze this girl.  And it's possible that we'll be.  Don't you understand?  That's kind of gunboat diplomacy you're using there.  You're holding that threat over your girl's head.  Like, it's not so much an explanation of, look what I could do.  It's like, look what I could do.  But I'm not.  No, no, no.  It's there.  The gun's in your head.  The gun's in your head.  But I'm not going to pull the trigger because, you know, I'm invited.  No, I'm not holding her hostage with that.  I am not holding her hostage with what I'm saying is why if me and like we're two people 
[00:45:30]  who are into it's like Bonnie and Clyde, man.  We are into what we're into.  Right.  But it's like Bonnie breaks protocol.  Clyde breaks protocol where he shoots the cop first.  She goes, I always want to shoot the cop first, but we're doing what we do.  But this time I messed up by shooting first.  But we're both shooters, man.  We're both out to kill.  Yeah.  But you know what?  You're wrong because if you had just a girlfriend on the side, you wouldn't be having a threesome.  You found a girl that wanted to have another girl. 
[00:46:00]  You want three at one time or two at one time.  You wouldn't get that with just a girlfriend.  What are you talking about?  If you had just this new girl on the side, that wouldn't be a threesome.  Oh, see, that's just another girl.  You're going laterally.  No, no, no, no.  You want to go up.  Wait a minute.  Time out, Vinny.  Time out, Mr. Family Everybody.  All right?  You kiss your wife in the mouth the same way you kissed her 10 years ago?  Yeah.  No.  Yes, I do.  Shut up, you.  There's so many kids.  You liar.  I'm sitting at kids every nine months.  Let me tell you something.  Nobody kid, nobody. 
[00:46:30]  How fine that girl is.  After a few years, man, you want a little strange.  I'm a fat hog.  I'm a mess naked.  I make me sick.  And my new house got big mirrors.  You're a mess dressed.  My girl should not be in the bed.  My girl should not be in the bed.  She shouldn't be loving me this much.  I'm telling you, man.  Hold on.  Save that rant for when we get back because we're late.  Damn.  Stay right there because we're not done with this.  By a long shot.  There's a bunch of people calling out threesomes are a disaster. 
[00:47:00]  All women.  No, that's a guy.  All women.  It's a disaster because...  Wait, Bruce in PA says threesomes are a disaster.  During Connecticut, some of us live just like Patrice.  So just hold that thought because we're a little late right now.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  And we'll continue with this thing in just a bit.  I can walk on my hands.  I can fart and chew gum.  I play the over.  I can ride a unicycle.  I wear a bra and laced panties.  So your talent is being queer, Travis? 
[00:47:30]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Walkover Talent Show.  If you have a unique skill, talent, music group, or physical affliction, we want to exploit.  You can email steve at foundrymusic.com with your ideas.  Or you can just show up during the walk to XM and start shucking and jiving.  Shucking and jiving?  Jesus, Danny.  I don't write this sh**.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Wow.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:48:00]  That last eight minutes could have been on the radio, but we had to play commercials.  Peltalker's heard it.  We're trying to do something for XM.  We're still waiting for the equipment to come in,  but we're going to do a thing where we start recording the stuff that happens during the commercials  and then playing that stuff back.  Yeah.  Because sometimes things happen.  Oh, my God.  It sucks that we had to take a break there, but Patrice O'Neal is in the middle of an amazing rant.  And a lot of people are saying that his rant is just like the rant I started with. 
[00:48:30]  I'm talking about a dumb park a lot.  He's talking about a relationship, but it's pretty similar.  With trying to get a threesome together.  And it is the same thing.  It's personal entitlement.  You feel entitled.  But there's a difference, man.  The difference is this.  All right.  O.P.'s like, hey, I can't get in this stadium.  This is making me sick.  It should not be like this.  I am angry about it. 
[00:49:00]  All right, O.P., what are you going to do?  Nothing.  Nothing, but it should be better.  All right, Patrice, I want to do threesomes.  Preferably have two girlfriends.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Or basically one girlfriend and we have a girlfriend.  So your relationship has a girlfriend.  Yes.  You and your chick, your girlfriend, have a girlfriend.  Have a girlfriend.  All right.  That's what I want.  I am trying to make strides in doing that. 
[00:49:30]  I am trying to make it happen because I think that –  You're trying to park closer to the stadium.  And the only –  That's all I see.  I want parking.  I want parking space.  He wants VIP parking.  And your girl is at every single aisle waving you further from the stadium.  And you're trying to explain to her that you'll be happy if I'm closer to the stadium because I'll be happy.  Because she's in the car with me and she's always going to – she's riding with me. 
[00:50:00]  So my happiness is happiness, man.  A woman's happiness is not based on anything except for trying to figure out how to be happy.  So if I'm happy and I have to cause her – I have to bring happiness to it, I have to be happy so that I'm in this mood to give her this happiness, to give her what she needs.  So how does this come into another girl dropping in and having sex with you too?  Because that makes me super happy. 
[00:50:30]  And I'll have enough happiness to give two women now.  So you're using the Reagan's trickle-down economics.  Trickle-down, man.  With happiness.  Trickle-down, man.  Because a woman's happiness, she just so not – she doesn't know, like, what makes her happy.  She just – okay.  Women go from place to place, specific to specific.  When me and my girl argue, I always try to argue the context of the entire thing. 
[00:51:00]  But is she allowed to argue with you?  Absolutely.  Oh, it doesn't seem like it.  I got a big mouth.  In Patrice's world, it seems like you shut your mouth.  And let me rule the whole place.  When I met her, when I met her, okay, I had a few women, okay?  She asked me – and I think I told you that she asked me how did she end up being my girl.  And I said, because you hung around.  You know, because you stayed in there.  You hung in there.  Oh, my God.  And what it is, it's like karate class. 
[00:51:30]  And this is women –  This relationship's a disaster.  Karate class.  Oh, man.  It's like karate class, man.  It's like you meet – look, would you agree that men deal in numbers when it comes to relationships?  When we have – we have to go find women.  We can't sit around and wait for women to come to us.  Right, right.  We have to actively go surround.  Yeah, you got to go seek and destroy.  It's like having a human resources department.  You may have the secretary you need, but she might leave your ass without two weeks' notice.  And see, you stuck. 
[00:52:00]  What, your company going to go out of business?  So what happens is when I met my girl, I had six – about five or six girls that I had been –  By the way, there's actually people out there saying you're full of ass.  Of course.  We know Patrice for a long time.  No, no, no, no.  He lives by different rules than most people.  I know there's a few out there also saying I live just like Patrice.  But in general, the average guy is not getting away with what Patrice is doing with his relationships and his life.  Did you ever think that your girl, your current girlfriend, just wants you and that's it? 
[00:52:30]  She does.  But she's playing these little games to keep you happy, hoping that maybe someday you're going to like give up on all this other crap and just settle down with her.  Can I tell you what my girlfriend is?  Yeah.  I'm going to tell you what she is.  All right.  She is a lesbian who is in love with me.  She hates men, but she loves me for whatever reason.  Because I was the first dude to be into her without being sexual with her.  She would hang out with me. 
[00:53:00]  I'd give her guidance.  She would go, don't I look good in this?  And I'm like, you look good, but you do.  But I would be honest.  You do.  But I would be honest.  I would be honest with her where other guys would lie to her to sleep with her just to sleep.  And she'd be like, well, why?  I'm a cool chick.  I do anything.  I'm down.  I don't play sex games with nobody.  But why is these dudes not making me their girl?  And I was telling her why.  And as I was doing that, she was falling in love with me. 
[00:53:30]  And I was just being frivolous.  So once I realized she was in love, I added her to the karate class.  And she happened to be, after I flip everybody, right, and they go, I'm getting out of this class.  By the end of the thing, there's two girls left and they're both black belts.  Once one loses and she's just like, out of here.  So now I have a black belt.  And she has a black belt in my crap because I can't feed her.  So that's why I don't cheat on her.  Because if I go out and I go talk to some girl I just met and I give her a white belt, like, lies. 
[00:54:00]  Hey, baby, some old easy white belt, yellow belt.  Yeah.  I come back to my girl with white belt mentality.  I come back to her.  I go, you know, hi-yah.  And she goes, she kicks me in the face and goes, I've never been able to kick you in your face that easy.  What you doing?  Talking to a white belt?  I got to stay focused with her.  Because she has a black belt in you.  She has a black belt in me.  She knows I'm not, like, I was going to say jiving her.  But I ain't jiving her.  I'm not playing games with her.  And she's not doing this for, she's a soldier, man.  I went to Brazil with her. 
[00:54:30]  She's not doing this for me.  She is definitely getting enjoyment.  She is a soldier.  All right, there's the answer.  I'm just asking, now I understand a little more about your relationship.  But now that's Brazil where, you know, you're paying for things.  There's a hooker out there that likes me.  She didn't like her.  I said, are you out of your mind?  You could have gave her $100.  She would have took it and you could have smacked her around and made her and say, yeah, you like my man, you whore.  Smack upside the head.  She didn't think like it.  Yeah, what's this don't like stuff? 
[00:55:00]  You're paying.  She did.  She just, there was a chick that just, she was my play girlfriend.  She had a girlfriend out there.  Yeah.  And she had more than just, I want your money.  She was like, I want your money and I, who's this?  And my girl's like, who's this?  Well, looking at you like, she'd like you like that.  So she's getting into a third world whores when they give her that vibe.  But the ones, the ones that don't give her that, all she wants is not to be challenged, man.  And she won't be.  Let me ask you.  You're bringing another girlfriend.  Yeah.  That's what's going to happen. 
[00:55:30]  Let me ask you.  I was just going to say that.  Now, this other girl comes in.  Your girl digs her because she's a lesbian that's in love with you.  You love the situation because now you got the two chicks.  But you are, well, let me just say, okay, you got one chick.  And we have one chick.  And you have one chick.  You don't have one.  Yeah, but she only gets two panties.  The other one gets four.  By your logic, by your logic, by your logic, you are so fantastic that this girl is going  to have to fall in love with you because you are a master of women. 
[00:56:00]  You will understand this girl.  You will start treating her.  Here's the trickle down.  She will fall in love with you.  It can't be two queens, Anthony.  There's one queen.  So are you going to have them duke it out?  So my girl, my girl will guide her through, like, okay, I love my nipples licked, right?  All right.  Now, we was in Brazil.  Go back to talking about parking lot.  Wait a minute, though. 
[00:56:30]  My girl's licking the nipple and there's another, there's a hooker licking the other nipple, right?  And my girl looks at the hooker and taps her on the top of her head and goes to let her  know that he likes to...  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.  So what will happen is if we find us a girlfriend, my girl will trickle down what I like to her.  I'm not going to have that much access to her.  So you're not even going to...  It's going to be all filtered through your chick.  She's going to have a little relationship daughter.  Your wants, needs, everything else. 
[00:57:00]  Filter through your chick.  Filter to your two...  Absolutely.  The new chick.  Yeah.  And that way you don't have much contact with her so she can't fall in love with you,  but she will know to do your bidding through your real chick.  Yeah.  Patrice's main girlfriend will be like the manager and then the girl will be like a worker  bee and she can tell her what's going on.  Yeah, yeah.  And Patrice can fire her through that manager.  You're out of here.  You need a reality show, man.  Oh, hell yeah.  Your people should be freaking...  Are they crazy not having Patrice on a reality show? 
[00:57:30]  They should be like pushing a reality show, Patrice O'Neal and his chick.  That would be a reality show I've watched.  Damn.  I pitched it.  Because there's some honesty there.  I went to Comedy Central, pitched it, and my girl came to the thing and they looked at  me like she came in and looked at me like y'all would look at me.  You know, when I'm talking and I go, look, I go, look, the show is going to be me,  God and women, right?  But I have a girlfriend and all I'm doing is trying to find a woman that might, this 
[00:58:00]  could be my girlfriend if I was looking for one.  Go to VH1.  Go to VH1.  Hustler or Playboy TV.  You can't go to Comedy Central.  Go to VH1.  Yeah, because this is no joke.  This is just very serious.  So this started with Patrice saying that you didn't get much sleep because you had the  argument with your girlfriend because she found out you were talking to another girl,  but you were talking to this other girl to bring her as a new girlfriend, but not as  important as the main girlfriend.  She only gets two pairs of panties. 
[00:58:30]  Your girlfriend that you love gets four.  She's always better.  So how did it end?  We had one of the best sessions we've ever had.  Oh, it ended with just...  She walked to the bathroom limping.  She crawled to the bathroom.  We had one of the best sessions we've ever had where she gets tired because I never get  tired arguing and she got tired and she's...  When there's logic involved because she feels how she feels.  And so she was just saying, look, I feel how I feel.  I don't want you hanging out the perception that this is some other girl and I look like 
[00:59:00]  a fool and this, that, and the third.  And I'm like, look, it's not going to happen.  And my logic was, why would I bring her?  It's too easy.  I'm just telling her, it's too easy to cheat.  It's too easy to cheat.  I'm not a nice guy with that particular situation.  Yeah.  You know, I'll get a little side, but I got a girl that I don't want to...  Losing her is important enough. 
[00:59:30]  But still, if I'm going to sacrifice the fact that I like to go get strange...  You'd rather just have it all right on the table.  This is what I'm going to do, so I need this from you.  Yes, but I got lucky and found a soldier.  What the hell does she see in you?  I'm a trooper, man.  I don't...  What the hell does she see in you?  She is a free...  She's free, man.  She's a free woman.  She's a lesbian, basically, so she doesn't like guys.  But she loves you. 
[01:00:00]  She loves me.  Why?  Because of your honesty?  Because I'm...  Because you take care of her bills?  Because you buy her nice things?  Like every other woman who falls in love with me, I guide them.  I don't leave them hanging.  All right.  I told her, if we break up, man, some lucky man's going to get a good woman.  Some of you dudes out there, if I go...  If you break up with your girl, I got to get a maniac that I got to fix.  All right.  Now let's get back to...  Now let's get back to what you said about Vinny.  I got to fix.  You said something else there that you don't kiss... 
[01:00:30]  No one...  Look, man.  My girl is lovely.  Vinny's wife is lovely.  Everybody got lovely women, man.  And after a few years, you cannot...  It's scientifically impossible for you to kiss your wife.  Science is being brought in now.  I read a book.  Yeah.  It's scientifically impossible to kiss your woman with that same, I just met you passion  if you've been with her for a few years.  So you got to find ways to jack it up. 
[01:01:00]  See, you got a family, Vinny, which kind of gives you that obligatory kind of, you know,  I'm a...  You're a dad.  You know, you're a family man.  But you kiss your wife like you just met her.  Don't lie, Vinny.  Well, you understand.  With kids, I can't kiss her that often.  So you're wrong.  When I get the kisser, it's fine.  Did you hear that?  Did you hear?  Yeah, because...  Did you hear the roller skating he did?  Well, I have kids.  Blah, blah, blah.  Shut up, Vinny.  You don't understand that because you're not...  There's something disconnected in you.  You're not a normal human being.  Yeah, that's why we love him.  We love you.  No, I... 
[01:01:30]  We love the Patrice.  Go ahead, Vinny.  No, listen.  You're not normal.  People don't like you when they meet you because you're not normal.  You're very...  But you like me, Vinny.  I love you.  You like me wideo when you met me.  You know why?  Yeah, because I wear the punch in the mouth.  Because it wasn't status quo.  It's like you meet some little intern in the elevator over at the Viacom building.  Hello, how's your morning?  How's it?  Shut up.  It's six in the morning.  Why?  Because you are raping me with your niceness.  Why is my bitterness in the morning so bad? 
[01:02:00]  Why is my bitterness different from your...  Hey!  Subjugate me with your fake...  How you doing?  Listen, you lost me somewhere.  No, because you want to go,  Hello, how are you?  Good morning?  Da-da-da.  And that's status quo.  But I met you and said,  Look at you, you short idiots.  And you go,  But that's what kind of guy you really are, Vinny.  You're a guy who gives people...  You mess with people all the time. 
[01:02:30]  And you go,  Wait a minute.  You had to get used to the fact that we didn't go through the social contract.  And all I'm trying to do...  This is what I'm trying to do, Opie.  I'm trying to eliminate the social filter and go from,  This is how I feel, to saying it.  And sometimes it still gets blocked and choked into the contract.  But I just want to come up and say...  You're not going to get an argument from me.  We relate on that level.  Right.  I just want to say what I feel like saying.  And if my girl asked me,  You know, you just want to be with two women and make two women your girlfriend. 
[01:03:00]  I go, Yeah.  Yes, that's how I feel.  All right.  Wow.  You were asking me about the dumb parking lot.  What's the solution?  So what's the solution to keeping the passion going in a relationship?  I think it's possible, actually.  I really do.  You tell me.  So far, I'm beyond happy two years in.  So I'm not at that point.  I mean, Vinny's trying to say...  How many years?  Twelve years.  Twelve years later, that it's exactly the same, the kissing?  This is what I do. 
[01:03:30]  Like, the other day...  Now, look, you're going to fucking jump...  No, I'm not.  You're going to jump...  Just listen to him and watch this unravel.  All right?  You're going to jump over me because you're going to say...  The other day, I got up.  I sent my wife flowers just to send her flowers.  That keeps her happy.  That makes her happy.  She got the flowers.  Why did you do that?  Because I love you.  That's why.  That's how...  That's protocol.  Because you know you've got to court your wife.  All you have to do, Opie, you've got to court your wife.  Look, I take care of myself.  I keep myself in good shape. 
[01:04:00]  That's how I keep it fresh.  You court.  Corey.  Exactly.  It's not boring.  It's easy to court your wife.  It's a $7 million house, Vinny.  Wow, you're really...  It's easy when you live in a house where you can ride around in the house.  You have a roller coaster in your house, Vinny.  Wow, you just gave all the guys out there a blueprint to keep their relationships going,  Vinny.  Give your wife flowers.  Flowers.  Flowers.  You know how...  That's hacky after a while.  I mean, sure, flowers are good, but you've got to do a little more than flowers.  It's not just flowers. 
[01:04:30]  Just give her a credit card.  Tell her to spend the money.  You go fake...  Exactly.  That's what you do.  You can't get in a relationship and get bored.  What happens, Vinny, right, when the money...  If the money runs flat, man, you ain't got no guidance.  You gotta work.  You don't...  See, you don't need guidance because you got...  You have enough money to...  That's the guidance.  You can buy her stuff.  You can send her on her cruises.  You can do all that stuff.  But where's the guidance?  Where's...  Where's...  Because you have to constantly figure out ways to buy her new stuff. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, Vinny, thank you for a new...  This is a diamond washing machine.  Thank you, Vinny.  And you said the same thing.  Four panties, two panties.  You're buying.  You said the same thing.  No, no, no.  You've got to keep her happy.  I don't keep her happy with buy.  I keep her happy with guidance because you know what?  What kind of guidance?  Here's what it is.  Once your girl...  Here's your guidance.  I'm bringing another girl.  Here's your hunt.  You train her how to lick my nipples.  And you don't think that's exciting for her to train another broad?  You're going to mess up.  You're going to lose that girl because you're trying to have two girlfriends. 
[01:05:30]  You're going to blow it off.  And here's the reason I'm not going to lose her because I'm trying to have two girlfriends.  I'm not trying to have one each.  You'll get four or two and then you'll need three.  He's trying to have a girlfriend for his relationship.  Can I speak for Patrice?  I think I know him.  If he loses his girlfriend because she's not into the girlfriend with another girlfriend thing, right?  Four panties, two panties.  So the other girlfriend's not as good as the main girlfriend and the main girlfriend leaves because of all this?  And Patrice's world is going to go, you know what? 
[01:06:00]  She wasn't worthy of this anyway.  I'm back out there.  The dojo opens back up.  That's right.  I'm back out there.  And he trains another black belt.  In his mind, he believes this is how he wants to live.  And he also believes that he's going to make it happen, whether it's with this one that he's currently with or with someone that he hasn't even met yet.  So to answer your question, Vinny, if he does lose that girlfriend, he doesn't care in the end.  Oh, I don't think Patrice does that.  He doesn't care in the end.  Yeah, I don't think he cares at all.  I don't think he cares about anything.  But I do.  I love my girl, man. 
[01:06:30]  I love my girl.  I tell her, look, man.  Look, I love my girl.  I watch too much Maury Povich, right?  I love my girl 90% because I need 10% to think that she is garbage, meaning that she could cheat on me.  She could do something foul to me.  But I give her 90% of my love.  I need 10% for me to function so I can look through my files and human resources and get me some more secretaries, get me some more candidates.  And it's not going to be easy, but I'm going to supplement. 
[01:07:00]  That's your insurance policy.  My girlfriend fills up 90% of me, 90%, okay?  Maybe 80% because I'm trying to muscle another chicken.  So she fills me up 80%.  That means you figure if it was 10 women, 10 women, it would take eight women, eight women to fill up the space sheet.  So I would actively go out and find eight women to fill the void.  But you love this girl.  I love my girl.  Let me ask you something.  You love her.  She comes to you tomorrow and says, look, Patrice, I love you too. 
[01:07:30]  I can't have a girlfriend for our relationship.  I say fine.  And if you want to talk to her, I've said it to her.  I said, sweetie, last night, I said, look, man, you can, let me tell you what a trooper she is.  All right.  I said, look, and you think this is reverse psychology, but I said, look, I don't want no trouble.  Just, we'll cancel this, man.  I'm sorry.  When I was out of, and she said, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm just saying.  She wants a piece of this girl.  She's sorry.  She was a hot mama.  A little Amazon, six feet, nice booty.  And Patrice almost has it all figured out.  You almost have this puzzle figured out.  But there's some pieces that got to be put, like, rearranged. 
[01:08:00]  Is that it?  But Patrice's main girlfriend is more lesbian than straight, and that's what's making this  whole thing kind of work.  That's what's kind of making it work.  Patrice almost has this puzzle figured out completely.  Almost.  You're almost there.  Would you accept a show on XM where it's you and your chick trying to find a third girl?  Did you?  I mean, yeah, another girl in the relationship?  No, because they'll just come out the woodworks, man.  It's the hunt.  It's the manipulation.  He doesn't want him, like, fishing a barrel. 
[01:08:30]  He's got to go out.  He's got to find a trooper.  He likes the game.  It's the game.  Yeah.  Finding the trooper, man, is exciting.  That's the game, friend.  All right, listen, we've got to get one person that agrees with Vinny.  There's one out there.  James in Oklahoma.  One.  James.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  I've been married 17 years, got four kids, still have sex three, four times a week.  Oh, he's really selling his life.  Listen to him.  He sound like there's a razor blade to his throat right now.  You listen to me, man. 
[01:09:00]  Let me copy how you sound.  I'm 17 years, man.  Four kids.  We've been doing this radio show a really long time.  I can tell you what's going on right now.  His wife is in the passenger seat.  You call him.  You call him.  You know you're happy.  It's been 17 years.  Get on the phone and defend our long relationship.  I love the show, but this isn't necessarily the show you should gauge relationships on.  Oh, we had a big fight three days ago.  All right.  Well, I'm telling you, maybe. 
[01:09:30]  It comes and it goes, man.  We have seen that, though, where all of a sudden a guy will call up and be like,  hey, that's pretty cool, and then you find out that his wife's going to work with him.  You call that show because we've been together, and I want people to know that you can be together  for 17 years and it can still be allowed to.  This is the radio show you listen to?  Well, you call them right now.  He's calling from his minivan with his car seats in the back.  And, sir, sir, if you're in the car listening, two things you ask yourself.  If she left you, what would you really miss?  Oh, my God.  And, two, if you told her how it was, where would she go and what would she do? 
[01:10:00]  She can't get another you.  You can get another her easy.  That's what I'm talking about.  You're not a normal person.  Wow.  That's not normal.  If your woman left you, Vinny, she could not find another dude to take with another beauty.  Vinny, I haven't been to your house.  Vinny has the best house I've ever seen in my entire life. 
[01:10:30]  Me, personally.  I mean, I haven't been to the other.  All right.  Yeah, we've got to take a break.  Can she find another you easier than you can find another her?  You tell me that.  Yeah, yeah, listen, she's listening.  Yes, she could.  All right, with that, it's the only virus spreading across America.  The O.B. and Anthony Fatty Pig Fatty Contest began like a stampede of hungry rhinos.  But now it more closely resembles a sleepy, winded elephant. 
[01:11:00]  The current heavyweight in the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest is Crystal from Cleveland, who weighed in at 430 pounds.  We're so sure there's someone bigger out there, we put up a fatty finder's fee in the amount of $1,000 to the person who brings in the heaviest girl by the end of the contest.  So grab your sonar equipment and find us a whale.  Remember, the heaviest girl at the end of the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest gets $10 for every floorboard-shattering, tear-inducing, self-esteem-destroying pound on her body.  Fat bottom girls, you make the rockin' world go round. 
[01:11:30]  Go to opieandanthony.com for contest details.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show!  Hey!  How you doing?  It's the O.N.A. virus.  Hope he's got his mouth full and we're all laughing here.  Wow.  Man, it doesn't stop during the breaks.  Patrice just keeps going on and on, just with all this knowledge and wisdom of relationships.  That is from the planet Krypton because it's nothing that can work here on Earth. 
[01:12:00]  If some reason, I think it's our oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere that just screws this whole plan of yours up.  Maybe you got to go to like Venus because you are just talking fantasy world.  It can happen.  Whatever you're talking about, let me tell you.  There's somebody out there living it more than I want to.  No.  Whatever you're talking about is possible. 
[01:12:30]  It can happen.  But it's the after effect, the repercussions, these things.  You're making it sound like you do this and then it follows up with this.  No, you do this.  It's like, all right, we got to clear out a spot here to build a house on.  So let me nuke it and then I'm going to build a house without thinking it's going to be irradiated for 8,000 years.  And you're like, well, it cleared the ground and now it's clear.  When you look at it like that. 
[01:13:00]  That's pretty funny.  You, like your plan is good up until the repercussion point.  We're just after repercussions.  You're kind of assuming too much on, you're planning too much on what this girl that you're bringing in is going to be all about.  Don't forget one basic thing.  That I am not putting on her to know anything.  I am guiding.  Right.  I am driving.  But you're not going to get an empty vessel.  So what will happen is she has two choices. 
[01:13:30]  Mm-hmm.  She ride or she gets out.  That's what I was saying earlier.  Well, we asked a question during the break about your, can we say?  Go ahead, man.  I don't know what you want to air or not.  It's fine, man.  But basically your girl.  I'm not going to say a name, you know what I'm saying?  But she's a good girl.  Yeah, basically a girl.  We asked if your girl's been with another dude and if that bothers you.  And then you said, what? 
[01:14:00]  I've seen her pop another dude.  Yeah.  I've seen her with another guy.  We went to a swing joint and I was, because of what I wanted to do, I had to.  There was no logic.  It would have just been pure hypocritical to say you can't sleep with another dude.  I didn't even want to put that in my head to say that.  So I said, okay, we're going to do this.  And what happened is the dude, what happens is when you're swapping, you know, when you're  swinging, you know, you're going, he goes in with his girl and I go in with my girl.  We go and we start with each other. 
[01:14:30]  You get the sex vibe going.  And we kind of, you know, switch, you know, trade up, switch up.  And he was very gentle with my girl.  Very, she liked him.  No funny, no strange fingers, no weird action.  And she, she, she nailed him like a soldier.  And he was very good to her.  And I was very good to his girl.  Hey, when you're in these situations. 
[01:15:00]  All right.  Now, I'm thinking like, what is it?  You're just sitting, standing there watching.  When you're in these situations and people look at you and go, oh, damn, that's Patrice  O'Neal from Web Junk.  Do you get recognized in those situations?  Whatever.  Like most people that watch, I mean, look, most of the people, my fans are more the fans  of this show and my fans like from HBO or some of them, Web Junk.  Web Junk people are like the little kids and the teenagers.  Yeah.  But a lot of those college boys, they crazy, man.  And they just know me.  I'm honest, man.  That's why I got Web Junk. 
[01:15:30]  It's like, I'm trying to be honest.  As honest as I can.  Well, you absolutely are.  I'll give you that much.  Somebody might call me out and I might have lied about something.  So I might have, you know, I've got these girls out there that mush my heart.  A couple when I was young.  And you just learn.  You live and you learn.  And my happiness, I just want to be happy.  It must have been a hell of a mushing.  What's wrong with some happiness?  It must have been a hell of a mushing because you have gone like in a wacky direction, Patrice.  All right, let's go to what?  Nothing wrong with your happiness.  Yeah, let's go to Jerry in Connecticut. 
[01:16:00]  Jerry.  Hey, boys, what's up?  Hey.  Is this my boy?  Patrice.  Hey, man.  What's up, man?  This guy's a trooper when I was doing a Black Phillip.  This is my boy.  You know this guy?  He's on my top eight.  Never took him off because he's living it.  Tell him, Jerry.  Listen, boys.  I've been living.  I've been married for 10 years, two kids, and I got a girlfriend living in a house for  the last nine years.  There you go.  What?  Nine years. 
[01:16:30]  Vinny, you got a 10,000 square foot house.  You can't have another girlfriend in there running around?  I think you might find her eventually.  Who's that?  I keep seeing that girl.  Just a fleeting glimpse down a hallway somewhere, a long corridor.  This guy's a soldier, man.  She live upstairs like, what's the thing from Pulp Fiction?  The Gimp.  The Gimp.  She upstairs.  They don't, him and his wife.  I remember the whole thing.  Him and his wife.  The girl and the wife have a little thing going.  He doesn't care that they mess around. 
[01:17:00]  You know why this works?  Let me tell you why this works.  Because Jerry is like one step away from serial killer.  Like, it's got to be.  He's a black guy.  We don't serial kill.  Well, the mentality is that of a serial killer.  How can you say that?  Because it's so out there.  He's got a kept woman in the attic.  No, she's not kept.  They know each other.  They hang out together.  They watch movies together.  They go shopping together.  Jerry, four panties and two, baby. 
[01:17:30]  You're like a Mormon then, in the old days.  No, he's happy.  Happy.  Very happy.  How does a fight happen in that house?  Like, in other words, does you ever get like two girls, they ever argue with you, the  two of them?  Team up?  Double the bitching?  Gotta.  Well, yeah, but I straighten that out.  That comment, I straighten that out.  Why is that a serial killer, man?  Why?  It's just some kind of weird mentality.  Why?  No, I'm exactly, exactly what Patrice is saying is exactly the way it is.  It just doesn't seem to... 
[01:18:00]  I train both of them.  I train both of them.  I train them.  I'm training.  It's this...  He's raising a good bitch.  He's raising his girl.  And you know what?  Neither one of them would leave if I asked them to.  Why did you marry the one?  Did you know the other one before you got married?  I did know her, but we weren't sexually involved.  And then after one year of marriage, you got this girl moved into your house?  Well, we started having sex first, so probably two years or so in the house. 
[01:18:30]  Just you and her, or are you her and the wife?  Me and the wife were living together.  We started having sex with my girlfriend, and then within two or three years, she moved  into the house.  Delicious.  That's my plan, too.  I just got a house myself, Jerry.  It has a nice attic.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  And does she come to you and say, like, I need money for, you know, something or clothes?  No, we just started living together, and I started taking care of her.  I bought her a new car.  I bought her...  What does the third person get out of this? 
[01:19:00]  That's what I don't get.  A new car.  I can see what you get.  A new car.  I can see what the wife gets.  But the girl, you know, in the attic with the chain around her ankle, what does she get?  She gets a fulfillment, man, that she's not going to get.  He has enough guidance to lead two women.  He can guide these women to something that they...  That virile feeling that they don't understand.  If you ask them why they love Jerry, they won't be able to tell you, because there's some 
[01:19:30]  kind of weird nature happening.  You don't think she's waiting for the wife to, like, die or something?  Oh, yeah.  After 10 years, of course.  Yeah.  She's been slowly poisoned, like flowers in the attic.  She's been giving him arsenic in the cookies.  He's a trooper.  Why can't you understand that?  I'm trying to understand this.  I can't understand it.  I mean, does this...  You have kids?  Yeah.  You have kids?  And you got kids.  What do they call her?  Aunt...  What's her name?  Aunt Whore? 
[01:20:00]  Aunt Whore.  What, Jerry?  They just call her by her regular name.  And what are you...  How old are your kids?  One's 11 and one is 7.  All right.  And what do they think about this relationship?  What are they being told?  She's the nanny.  No, it's perfectly normal to them.  They don't...  Wait, wait.  It's perfectly normal.  How much do they know about this relationship?  They...  I've had my kids go...  Uh-oh.  Is that your new girlfriend when I have a girl come over the house?  Who goes to back to school night?  Yeah. 
[01:20:30]  Who goes to the PTA meeting?  Look at Vinny.  That's all he cares about.  I can't understand that.  He can't wrap his...  You do understand it.  He can't wrap his arms around this in any way.  Jerry, man.  I'm sorry.  I left us hanging.  One of these days...  So who does the laundry?  And if I bring flowers home, who gets what?  Yeah.  Are there shared duties?  Dude, do they...  And Jerry's not a...  Jerry doesn't...  It's not like, hey, baby, then if they get out of line, I'm going to smack him in the  top of the chops.  I don't...  I've never touched my girl.  I'm threatening my girl, man.  None of that, man.  It's a guidance. 
[01:21:00]  It's a thing.  It's tapping into this thing where she's just looking at you, man.  Like, this is so sexy.  I've seen...  Look, I've seen TV shows about Mormons and people that are into polygamy and stuff like  that, and the women are always a little screwy in the head.  Stepford.  Which...  I'm sorry.  Yeah, they're like...  I'm sorry.  Which woman do you know that's not screwy in the head?  I'm sorry.  No, in a different way.  I'm talking...  They're a little, like, way out there, a little screwy in the head as far as, like, their relationship 
[01:21:30]  with the man is very submissive, very submissive, and they have a relationship with each other  like, almost sisterly, and Patrice isn't saying anything wrong.  He's like, yeah, and this is great.  So, they're not actual...  They're not real women.  They're puppets.  They're Stepford wives. 
[01:22:00]  Why?  Why?  Because there's two of them.  So, if he did the same thing with his one wife...  You're not getting a loving relationship from...  Are you loving, Jerry?  He's on hold because I wanted to go to Joe.  You're not getting a real loving relationship.  You're getting sex from two different women.  How do you know what you're getting?  Have you ever done it?  How do I know?  Wait a minute, Anthony.  Have you ever done it?  You was...  Now, for what I understand about...  I pay through the nose every three months because of it.  Why do you think I got divorced?  I'm saying, but did you experience any of this action with your old wife? 
[01:22:30]  Did you find out if this is wrong?  Didn't I just explain everything?  Do you think I'm talking out my ass about this whole thing?  No, I'm saying, did you do a threesome with your wife?  I am so experienced that...  Of course I did!  All right.  I know everything.  What happened?  What happened?  I write huge checks every three months.  You got divorced because of a threesome?  That was part of it.  That was the straw that broke the camel's back.  Threesome was it?  Yeah.  That was the straw that broke the camel's back. 
[01:23:00]  There was a lot going on.  Joe and Jersey.  That was the one where, when the questioning came about in the courtroom, and I would watch  the news and the post reporters there, I said, let's go in the back and settle this  immediately.  Joe, what's up?  I just want to say, Patrice sounds exactly like every cult leader I've ever heard.  Cult leader.  That's what I...  I'm sorry.  I said serial killer.  I meant cult leader.  That is absolute...  Bravo, sir.  Sounds like you.  Cult leader. 
[01:23:30]  You're a cult leader.  He's got nothing to say.  He's been found out.  Look at him.  Wow.  That's right.  He's proud of that, though.  Because once he swings two, do you think it's going to stop?  That's right.  The hunt is going to go, like, stop there?  He's going to then go, you know, if I could get three girls...  And I got some poison Kool-Aid waiting for the hole right now.  The FBI is going to be lobbing grenades through your window.  No, they're not.  They're going to be joining me for dinner.  Come on in.  Come on in, Lieutenant.  Have a little peace here. 
[01:24:00]  He doesn't seem to be hoarding weapons.  He's hoarding bitches.  Is there a law against this?  Officer, put that down.  Come on in.  Let's go to Edward in Queens.  Edward, you want to have her over there?  Go ahead.  Edward, parking lot Y.  I can't believe it.  Good morning.  Yeah.  It all started with parking lot Y, by the way.  Let's remember that.  Fair enough.  All right, Edward.  What's up?  Yeah, what's up, gentlemen?  What's up, man?  Yo, Patrice, I've been married for about nearly six years now.  I love this woman to death, but I want to get away from her now.  Yeah.  And you know what will keep you from not getting... 
[01:24:30]  Because you're not sexually explosive towards her no more.  And so now you're figuring that it's getting bad because you're not sexually feeling the  way you used to.  That's because innately we need...  Look, God don't make mistakes.  There's five or ten women born to every one guy.  Because God knows we will sleep with five or ten women to keep this world going.  All you got to do, man, is talk to her and say, look, I just need...  Here's what...  You go to a swing club. 
[01:25:00]  Go to La Trapeze, man, right?  And let me tell you what it'll do.  La Trapeze.  What's that?  I don't know where it is, but it's...  Just look it up.  It's very...  It's not one of those...  It's not one of those things where you knock and say, Joe sent me.  You can go in.  And here's the thing, dude.  Let me tell you what you need to do.  You need to watch another guy want your woman.  And you will be excited again.  And she needs to watch another woman want you.  And y'all will want each other again.  It will last an extra five more years of excitement.  Because you're living this married life of what you're supposed to be living. 
[01:25:30]  If you go out and you find strange guys that want to pop your wife, you're going to be  like, oh, I want her.  That can't be done like you're talking about one extreme.  Can't that be done at a mall?  Right.  Can't that be done with her looking real good, walking around and guys look at her?  No.  No, because it's going to be filtered from the other guys.  You got to take her someplace where the protocol is some dude in a towel.  And his chick, with her breasts hanging out, say, listen, your girl is gorgeous. 
[01:26:00]  And you go, yours is too.  And y'all go in a room and you watch some other dude want your woman.  Well, it's a little further than want.  He's getting.  Hey, well, what are you going to do?  Can't have everything.  And I'm telling you, that'll spark y'all up, dude.  I'm telling you.  Jesus.  No, I'm not lying to you, man.  I'm telling you.  We're talking animal stuff here.  We're not talking.  Let's get socially.  Let's clear our minds.  Vinny, are you taking notes over there or what?  I'm listening.  I'm going to try and sell this to my life tonight. 
[01:26:30]  Let's clear our minds socially, man.  Let's just clear the social contract.  Let's talk about animal.  Let's talk about what you feel, man.  I don't know what you feel, but whatever you feel, you just aren't into her.  And, you know, you're a good guy and you love her, but you're questioning yourself.  You're going, why?  You know what?  I'm going to tell you why I feel like this now.  Because for the last month, it's just been beefing, beefing, beefing.  And last week, we got into a fight so bad that I locked out of the house and she had  me committed for the night.  You're done, dude. 
[01:27:00]  Get out of it.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over.  Don't get out of it.  This is your fault, dude.  It's your fault because that's what they do.  You have to guide them.  You have to let them know anything crazy she does, you have to dismiss it with logic,  man.  You have to beat her down with logic.  I'm telling you, man, your marriage isn't over.  She's got some thing where girls get a little like, I need excitement.  Let me tell you something.  Any emotion is an emotion for a woman.  Hatred is the same thing as love for them.  If a girl hates me, I know I can get her because I'll flip it over. 
[01:27:30]  It's yin and yang, man.  Flip your wife.  I'm telling you.  Hate is love.  Work is freedom.  I love it all.  I'm telling you, man.  Dude, don't give up, man.  I'm telling you, man.  Try that out, man.  Because let me tell you, she's got to throw this one back.  That's what I'm saying.  She cannot.  Yeah.  You're watching people out of the house.  Let me tell you something.  You're not going to find a woman who won't do that.  You got to make every woman you with, you got to make her into your girl. 
[01:28:00]  Your wife is your wife, Vinny.  If she left you, she'd have to become someone else's wife.  And I don't mean just I do.  She has to know what makes you mad, what makes you happy, and she has to care about what makes you mad and what makes you happy.  His wife doesn't care because she thinks he doesn't care, so she's doing dumb stuff for drama to get attention.  And that's your fault because you started off like that.  If you're going backwards, it's hard to turn around, man. 
[01:28:30]  But now you got to start turning around and you got to take an L.  Patrice wants every guy out there to be a pimp.  This is like pimp mentality.  But not hit your wife or put her on the avenue.  So what's he supposed to do now?  Let's see.  Here's an example.  She walks up to him and, you know, what the hell do you do?  You didn't vacuum the floor.  This place is up.  You know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  She's bitching.  What's he supposed to do now after six years of taking that?  Bring home a new girlfriend.  Apparently.  What haven't you been listening to? 
[01:29:00]  Apparently.  What am I, stupid?  I know.  The answer was right in front of me.  Somebody wants to call your cult, Cult 45, by the way.  He doesn't have a name, but he did it from his cell phone.  Can I have that for the book, Cult 45?  Some girl from Austin.  I watched my husband F2 women on Saturday, and he still F'd me when he got home.  This does happen in real life, and Patrice can get what he wants easily.  Many couples we know have a girlfriend.  Delicious.  God bless. 
[01:29:30]  God bless.  It's a big world.  A lot of people out there.  A lot of people.  Go to Adult Friend Finder.  Go to Pal Talk on whatever lonely room and watch some broad somewhere taking her boobs  out just to be loved.  I've seen it on Pal Talk, yeah.  Mammy Pellegrosso.  Let's go to Paul in Brooklyn.  Paul.  Hey, what's up?  You got people joining your cult like crazy, by the way.  Yeah, man.  They're calling in.  Yeah, Paul.  Hey, he was talking about that place, Lodger Pease. 
[01:30:00]  It's on 27th and 5th.  I've been there.  Delicious.  Another soldier.  Another soldier.  Paul, what's this place about?  Hey, you know, the place is what is, just like he says, you go there, you have to go in  there with a woman, or if you're a single woman, you can get in.  Yeah, no guys just walking in.  Hey, I want to see somebody.  Well, hey.  I got nothing to trade.  Yeah.  I want to pick someone up on waivers, if you don't mind. 
[01:30:30]  So you go in, you bring a chick.  Right, but the deal is with me, I'm married, and the girl I go with is married.  I know her husband.  She knows my wife.  But her and I get together, and we go there, and then we swap with other couples, and then  we go back to our perspective of others, like, you know, whatever, and we just have a good  time.  It's hard to explain.  It is.  You got too many others in there.  I couldn't.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:31:00]  The other.  Okay, here's the one thing, though.  Do your wife and her husband know?  No, of course not.  So then it's a little bit, you're kind of cheating with each other, but here's the thing.  Listen to this.  Let's boil this down.  All right.  Let's boil this down.  He is cheating on his wife, and he still needs extra booty.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  Guys.  Wait, are you sleeping with the other guy's wife?  Are you just taking her out and swapping her? 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  Because you know why?  Because he's a winner, and this other woman's a winner, and they're with two people that  guys goes, his wife goes, and her husband goes, no, and they both ran into each other  and went, hey, let's do something crazy.  It's still not enough.  Let's swap each other, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's go down there and swap each other.  He's just using her to swap.  I could get a lot more for you than I can for my wife.  Come on.  You know what I could get for you? 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  You know what else is great?  Yeah.  She loves other women, too.  She's all over the place.  Do you hear how happiness...  Wait a minute.  Time out.  Do you hear how elated this guy is to talk...  He sounds like a straight, lazy dude, right?  Did you hear Mr. I Love My Wife, 17 years, four kids?  He sounded like death warmed over.  He sounded like he was praying for cancer.  He sounded like he was practicing to have cancer.  Night of the Living Dead. 
[01:32:30]  I Love My Wife.  Four kids.  And everybody throws their four kids and everything.  Like, that's the validation for your misery.  This dude's like, dude, I'm cheating on my wife.  I love it.  I love my best friends.  And we're swapping.  He's getting her to the swingers club.  He's happy to get this out.  It was like a sickness on his soul.  He gets to say it and not be judged because I'm in his corner.  Go get him, Tiger.  All right. 
[01:33:00]  Thank you, Paul.  All right.  Later, guys.  Yeah, we got to take another break.  Maybe we'll get into some other things.  Amazing.  Hey, Steve Lyons got fired.  You know what that's about?  We'll talk about that after the break.  Did he get fired, fired?  Or did he get fired from just doing the...  Well, we'll get into it after the break.  It's pretty interesting.  And Rita Crosby's interview from...  Rita Crosby.  It's Rita Crosby.  You got her audio from Rita Crosby.  From MSNBC.  MSNBC.  Join me, Rita Crosby.  I talk about nothing because I can't talk.  What the hell is wrong with her? 
[01:33:30]  I constantly have a sore throat.  Jesus.  Does anyone have a lawsuit?  I'm a talk show host.  How ironic is this?  I can't even talk.  That's hysterical.  Well, she interviewed Screech.  She interviewed Screech.  Isn't that ironic, too?  And a little observation.  Some people out there will get it.  How many people tell you, Vinny, you sound just like the father from Little People, Big World?  Yeah, I hear that.  I didn't hear that.  I was like somebody.  I haven't watched that show yet.  Have anyone come up to you yet? 
[01:34:00]  The show's starting to take off.  Yeah.  The Midget Family.  It's a reality show with a midget family.  Actually, the husband and wife are midgets, and they had one midget and three normal kids, right?  Or two.  Three.  Three, yeah.  That's got to be hard to disappoint your children.  Oh, I know.  Towering over you.  When you sound just like the father.  Just like the father on that show, Little People, Big World.  Yeah, the mom gets, she's four foot tall, and her son's already like six foot, and she's yelling at him.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  It's got to be hard.  I'll dribble you like a basketball. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, mom, what are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  All right, it's the ONA virus.  On my big head and throw her.  Yeah, right?  Spreading across America.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA uncut and live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.

[01:35:00]  Patrice O'Neill in studio for Jim Norton.  Jim will be back tomorrow.  Vinny Brandt in studio.  Owner of the Stress Factory in New Brunswick.  Very funny comedian in his own, right, Vinny?  Absolutely.  I've said it over the years.  You run just a great club down there.  Yeah, it was fun.  Patrice was there this weekend.  I wonder why he wouldn't start.  You went on the air on Monday to promote a show you did last weekend. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, what do you want to do the worst ever?  These guys are busy.  I've got to get in with him.  Patrice don't care, though.  Whatever.  He's like, he doesn't see the big picture.  I don't know.  He cares when it's check-writing time.  Believe me, he cares then.  He knows damn well he could have called us Thursday and then got a nice plug-in, but he was too busy scouting.  Scouting women for a future threesome.  That's more important.  By the way, I hate you.  You screwed up my football picks.  Dude, I am sorry. 
[01:36:00]  You were here, what, two weeks ago, and you did my football picks.  One for five.  You went one for five for me.  I was in hives going, oh, my God.  He's probably calling me the biggest dummy ever.  I felt bad.  I really wanted to pick one.  Dude, I was in this competition.  We got $10,000 that we're going to give somebody.  I'm in with the other guys.  Ant's not in.  And whoever gets the most picks by the end of the year gets $10,000.  And if I win, I'm throwing it out of a helicopter somewhere.  Are you still in the lead?  Now, I got $14,000, right? 
[01:36:30]  Steve's got $17,000, and Bill's got $15,000.  I'm kind of in it.  We're all kind of in it still, I guess.  Hey, man.  I went two for five this past week.  I picked the Jets and the Steelers out of a hat, actually.  I took my picks out of a hat this week, and I did better than you.  Damn.  Not much.  I only went two for five.  You went one for five for me.  I was hoping to get out of that one, Scott Free.  I want a waterhead to do my pick so bad, but we can't find one.  The football picks are sponsored by Dish Network. 
[01:37:00]  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  That's 1-888-GET-DISH.  Don't forget, $10,000 up for grabs for one of these guys behind the scenes.  And the competition's getting fierce.  You saw the emails yesterday, Ant?  Oh, yeah.  One of them was from Travis, and it just said,  Dummy Steve beat everyone this week.  He's still on top.  Dummy Steve.  Well, supposedly, Travis is supposed to be pretty good at the football picks.  Mm-hmm.  Is he still in it, then? 
[01:37:30]  For Travis?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  That was terrific.  Thanks.  No, he's three behind.  Oh, he's three behind?  Okay.  And Steve went four for five this week.  Wow.  All right.  So what's the deal with Steve Lyons?  Well, you might remember a few weeks ago, we talked about him because he had commented  on a guy in the stands during the playoff game early on.  He said, hey, look at that guy.  He's got a digital camera stuck to his face.  And it turned out, and it turned out it was that poor old gentleman who was blind who has 
[01:38:00]  to wear this big goggly thing on his face so he can see the game.  Some futuristic apparatus.  Yeah.  Something that helps the blind see.  And he made this remark about how, hey, look at the old guy with the camera stuck to  his face.  Yeah, they made fun of the guy.  So he caught a little bit of hell for that, but he kind of skated.  Everything was cool.  But this past weekend, I guess he just said something that was a little too appropriate, 
[01:38:30]  inappropriate for air.  I thought he said something about Lou Piniella.  That's what it was.  This was the second thing he did.  Oh, Jesus.  It was about Lou Piniella.  Oh, man.  Steve Lyons has been fired for making a racially insensitive comment directed at colleague  Lou Piniella's Hispanic heritage on the air during Game 3 of the American League Championship  Series.  Steve Lyons has been relieved of his Fox Sports duties for making comments on air the company  found inappropriate.  Lyons have been working in the booth for the ALCS alongside Tom Brenneman. 
[01:39:00]  And Piniella, the number two broadcast team for this Fox Post season, in the second inning  of Friday's game between Detroit and Oakland, Piniella talked about the success light-hitting  A's infielder Marco Scutaro had in his first round of playoffs.  Piniella said that slugger Frank Thomas and Eric Chavez needed to contribute, comparing Scutaro's  production to finding a wallet on Friday and hoping it happened again next week. 
[01:39:30]  Later, Piniella said the A's needed Thomas to get en fuego, hot in Spanish, because he  was currently frío or cold.  After Brenneman praised Piniella for being bilingual, Lyons spoke up.  And this is where the problem occurred?  And here's where the problem starts.  Lyons said that Piniella was hobbling espanol, butchering the conjugation for the word to  speak, and added, I still can't find my wallet. 
[01:40:00]  I don't understand him, and I don't want him to sit too close.  And I don't want to sit too close to him now, Lyons continued.  Like, joking that he might steal his wallet?  Yeah.  Who cares?  Come on.  This guy should have a job.  Right now, somebody's got to give him a job.  Fox executives told Lyons after the game, he had been fired.  For that?  Oh, geez.  Just for that.  That's nothing.  I think we actually got it here.  Let's take a lesson.  You're a shock jock.  Oh, that's genius.  One and two to cap.  Almost found back out of play. 
[01:40:30]  The bilingual, Lou Piniella.  It's funny there.  Lou's oblonged some espanol there, and I'm still looking for my wallet.  Oh, boy.  I don't understand him, and I don't want to sit close to him now.  They're yucking it up in the booth.  And I don't know why the other dude is still working.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's funny.  You know how those spics could be.  Wasn't that Lou Piniella laughing? 
[01:41:00]  Wasn't that Lou Piniella laughing?  No, I think that was the other guy.  He got fired over that.  That's nothing.  We all got a little too sensitive here.  He's insinuating that Puerto Rican steal wallet.  Right.  No, but he was doing a callback, though.  Yeah.  Come on.  What's the problem?  Are we a little too sensitive here?  Are we a little too racially sensitive here?  I think so.  I think so.  I think so.  You think so?  I think that shit. 
[01:41:30]  Look, man, I love.  I just love when white people get in trouble, but I got to be fair.  Yeah, let's be a little fair, though.  That was nothing.  That was nothing.  I wasn't upset about Rush Limbaugh when he was talking about, you know, a couple of years.  Oh, yeah.  Like, black quarterbacks.  Because I was like, there's enough black quarterbacks for a white guy to say something bad about a black quarterback now.  Like, it's not a special thing anymore.  It's like...  There's not yet one black quarterback that you're bashing.  It's like, everybody's a black quarterback.  And they all don't scramble.  Look at Goofy.  What's his name from Jacksonville?  He's just a slow white boy, but he's black. 
[01:42:00]  And it's like, that statement, that's what people do.  You know what?  That's what people who watch a baseball game, that's the kind of humor you would have.  I always daydream about having enough technological ability to just take over some type of broadcast and just be foul.  Hey, we didn't read this part of the story.  You know, when you get fired, then they have to tell you, they list all the other things this dope probably did, right?  Oops.  The network apologized for Lyons' remarks at the time. 
[01:42:30]  Earlier in the playoffs, while working in the Mets-Dodgers game, Lyons unwittingly made fun of a nearly blind fan who was wearing special glasses to see the game.  We talked about that.  All right.  He's got a digital camera stuck to his face, Lyons said.  He also once pulled down his pants on the field during his playing days.  Pulled his pants down?  What's so bad about that, either?  Well, they have to add it to the story, though.  See, he's out of control.  Well, he put him over a little kid's head as a hat. 
[01:43:00]  We've got to just calm down.  Once had a couple have sex at St. Pat's.  Oh, wait a minute.  That's our tag.  Just get a robot to call the game, because these guys are going to screw up from time to time, God forbid.  Yeah.  A base hit.  He didn't really say much, and it was a callback to something that was said earlier.  That was a double.  Look, that dead spig still my wallet.  Look at that monkey, Ron. 
[01:43:30]  Those mechanical voices.  Well, that's...  That was a base hit.  They pitch high and wide for ball two.  Black people are better athletes because they were bred that way.  They have bigger muscles in their thighs and the buttocks.  Why did he get fired for that?  We were bred to be strong bucks.  And people didn't like it.  And it's paying off.  Jimmy the Greek. 
[01:44:00]  Thank God for sports and slavery.  Do we have the Jimmy the Greek?  Yeah, we got it.  Oh, let's listen.  This is a classic.  And you know the cameraman was on Jimmy, and I had seen the clip so many times, and Jimmy was drinking.  He was having a few cocktails.  It was at some kind of an event.  He was on top of the world, by the way.  He was on top of the world back then.  They always used to go to Jimmy the Greek about any sport.  And he's talking, and you know the guy with the camera's just going, oh, my God, I'm taping the death of Jimmy the Greek right here.  Here it is. 
[01:44:30]  This is gold.  And he's Jimmy the Greek.  Yeah.  They wouldn't even have that name.  Exactly.  He's not even James Smith.  Jimmy the Greek.  By the way, really fast, as we move on here, a lot of people are saying that that was Piniella laughing in that clip.  Was it?  Yeah.  A lot of people are saying that.  I'll have to see this.  All right, let's go to Jimmy the Greek.  The black is a better athlete to begin with because he's been bred to be that way because of his high thighs and big thighs that goes up into his back. 
[01:45:00]  And they can jump higher and run faster because of their bigger thighs.  And they sell for more money.  This goes back all the way to the Civil War.  When during the slave trading, the big, the owner, the slave owner would breed his big black to his big woman so that he could have a big black kid.  Oh, Jesus.  You're supposed to be mad at that, but he's only saying it's just the way he's giving it.  Right.  It was the way he said it when he said it.  Yeah.  It's big black to a big black woman. 
[01:45:30]  You know, you're big black like he's got some at home.  I got a black breeding farm at home I just opened up.  He should have just named him.  See, when Leroy was smacking Bertha's booty, things was happening.  They had a little Cleophus and this nigga can't run.  God damn Jimmy the Greek, man.  Gone after that.  Disappeared from the face of the earth.  Written out of every friggin' book that you don't hear about him. 
[01:46:00]  Nothing.  He never existed.  Stalinism took over.  Like Russian history.  That's it.  Gone.  Gone.  And your boy dressing up in women's clothes and stuff made a comeback.  Oh, yeah.  You're the figure.  Jimmy made a comeback.  Marv Albert made a comeback.  Marv Albert was biting chicks, leaving bite marks in them.  Jim O'Brien?  Oh, Pat O'Brien.  Pat O'Brien.  Pat O'Brien leaving dirty phone messages on there.  Bill O'Reilly continues.  It's not about sex.  Race will get you screwed.  Well, it's about sex with, you know, but it was more about religion than sex with our problem. 
[01:46:30]  Right, right.  It wasn't about the act.  They did it in 20 other places around the city, but no one cared about that.  It was the church.  But anything with race, religion, things like that, that will get you in trouble.  And people are looking to get pissed off.  People want to get annoyed.  They want a mission in life.  We got Howard Cosell's nephew, right, Colin?  No, grandson.  Oh, grandson.  I always mess that up.  Howard Cosell's grandson.  Sounds just like Howard, too.  Yeah.  Look at that monkey runt. 
[01:47:00]  Look at Strahan, climb the Empire State Building.  Hey, Colin.  How are you guys?  Do your grandfather proud and do the line.  I've got to say, there's no bigger abomination than calling Howard Cosell a racist.  But you can say, look at that little monkey runt.  Now, why is it?  I have a question for you guys.  Why is it that every time I call in or I hear my grandfather imitated on the show, Patrice is in, and you guys start playing the race card? 
[01:47:30]  I don't know.  It's just when Patrice is in.  It's just fun.  We feel safer.  It is fun.  Your granddad was fantastic.  Look at that.  You've got to love Howard Cosell.  Stop the fight.  I love that.  There was just something that Cosell added to the event you were watching.  He really did.  Yeah, the fight couldn't be better.  And there's Howard.  Stop the fight.  Stop the fight. 
[01:48:00]  Down goes Frazier.  And a nigga has my wallet.  I think Joe is her.  Angie Dundee, Ali's trainer right next to me, is saying that you may hear him.  Down goes Frazier.  Down goes Frazier.  Down goes Frazier.  I love that call.  I just made my day with that clip.  See?  Isn't that great?  It's fantastic, man.  A lot of people think that was Ali, but it was Foreman, right? 
[01:48:30]  It was Foreman.  That was bouncing him all over.  A lot of people think that's a famous Ali clip, but it was Foreman knocking out Frazier.  Foreman knocking him out and up.  Huh?  That was Foreman, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But thank you guys for letting me come on and defend my grandfather as not a racist,  unlike Jimmy the Greek, who was calling it and telling it like it is.  Thanks, Colin.  All right, Colin.  Come in and see us.  We still haven't met you face to face.  Oh, well, one of these days I'll get in there. 
[01:49:00]  All right.  Thanks, Colin.  All right, man.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  He's got the jacket, too.  Yeah, he's going to bring in the jacket and stuff.  The ABC jacket.  I love how it was great, man.  It's just funny to do that.  I know.  Look at that.  Monkey run.  Look at Michael Stray.  Let's talk about Rita Crosby.  All right.  Let's talk about Rita Crosby.  How does she keep her job with that?  I don't know.  I don't know, man.  It just sounds like she's been on an all-night bender every day that she has to work.  She's growing polyps as we speak. 
[01:49:30]  Just big.  She opens her mouth.  You just see cauliflower down there in her throat.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  And you got to sit there and pretend like that voice isn't a distraction.  Horrific.  A complete distraction to what she's saying.  Because you're sitting there like you're not listening anymore because you're like, I don't  even think she's going to get to the end of this sentence.  Guys, I've been handed the cure for AIDS.  Here it is.  You need one part.  And people just be like, I don't care what she's saying. 
[01:50:00]  And the thing, and this is what I'm saying about socially, now it's like, not only do  we have to look at that mess, she can't even have a sexy voice now.  No.  It has to be complete, non-objective sexuality with some, like, Greta Van Susken has a sexy  thing about it.  She's hittable.  Are you?  Is she?  Greta is a little hittable.  She's more hittable than-  She had that surgery, though, the plastic surgery.  Yeah, she sleeps through her eyes open now. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, that's real hot.  She's the most hittable chick going with you on the bottle alters out there.  Who's better?  All right, I'll tell you a couple of that.  The chick from CNN.  Yeah, yeah.  What's her name?  I don't know her name, buddy.  God damn it.  That channel's wrong.  Diane Sawyer.  No, not Diane.  I would do Diane Sawyer before Greta.  She's an old bag.  Thank you for saying, at least, at least I'm not as crazy as I would sound with Greta.  What?  No!  Nancy Grace!  The one with his panicking. 
[01:51:00]  What's wrong with you, Eron?  He's like Hispanic.  He's got dark hair, kind of shoulder length.  I don't know.  Tells her name.  Oh, uh, she's very popular.  So-  So-  So-  So-  So-  So-  So-  So-  What?  Soledad?  Soledad.  Soledad O'Brien.  I'm saying-  She's hot.  All I said was Diane Sawyer over Greta.  Then the other-  The copter bitch from the news.  Ah!  From, uh, CW11, whatever.  No, we're talking about-  We're talking about- 
[01:51:30]  Network.  The major majors.  All right.  Right?  I'll still go with the, uh, Soledad O'Brien.  Just give me a voice.  If she's gonna look like that, give me a voice like, hey, you know, sit down.  This is, you know, blah, blah, blah.  No one was worse than that Batista girl from, uh, CNN that was on for years with one eye  going one way, one going the other.  You can't listen to a word of news she's saying.  Bobby Batista?  Is that her name?  One guy going one way, the other guy going-  She was cross-eyed or something.  Yeah, the news in the middle going, I can't understand what she's saying.  Paul is on.  Thank you, guys.  What do you want from me?  Paul is on.  What do you want from me?  Paul is on? 
[01:52:00]  Yes.  Over Greta?  I think I'd agree with that.  There's a lot over Greta, believe me.  Uh, yeah, Fatty Picks.  Katie's getting, uh, long in the tooth.  Yeah, but she's-  Katie Couric.  Over Greta.  Yeah, absolutely.  Katie Couric over Greta, I would say.  Over Greta?  Yes!  I'd put him in the same exact category.  Meredith Vieira over Greta.  Meredith Vieira, try to drag her out of a minivan.  We're not talking about supermodels here.  All of them.  You didn't give me much to work with, okay?  You'd have to take off their mom jeans.  Diane Sawyer.  The one with the bunt already cut in.  Yeah, Diane Sawyer, and I'll defend that all day over the other messes. 
[01:52:30]  Diane Sawyer.  She's filmed every day through that swat of Vaseline.  They smack on the lens.  That's right above Walter Cronk.  Yeah.  Thank you, Opie.  This is fantastic.  I have no doubt in my mind that the listeners in general would agree.  No.  Freaking Diane Sawyer over Greta.  Same category.  Yes!  I don't think so.  Same category.  You're insane.  What's better to eat?  Uh, uh, uh, dog crap or cat crap?  That's the same choice you're being given here. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, cat crap.  If you have to make a choice.  Yeah, cat crap.  It's more nibbly and chunky.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Less of it.  You're pretty much asking us to bake a cake with cat crap.  It's the same thing as what I'm saying.  We gotta eat this damn thing, so I'll figure something out here.  It's just the worst.  All right, listen.  Here we go.  Rita Crosby interviewing Screech.  This is sex tapes, Patrice.  Right down your alley, probably.  Screech was losing his house.  You got the sex tapes?  You got sex tapes?  Yeah.  You tape yourself?  No. 
[01:53:30]  Nah.  We live it.  You just live it?  All right.  Well, Screech was losing his house, so he made a sex tape and all that.  Yeah, but it goes a lot deeper.  He was trading tapes with on what I hear.  It does.  He's supposed to be well-endowed.  Yeah, supposedly he's got a Johnson on him.  Yeah.  That's what somebody was telling me that.  Yeah, he's like the new head of Hollywood, as far as that goes.  It went Uncle Miltie.  It went Uncle Miltie.  And then it went Forrest Tucker from F Troop was supposed to be, like, next in line.  And then since Uncle Miltie died, James Woods now has taken over the biggest in Hollywood. 
[01:54:00]  All right.  Well, let's get right.  But Screech, right in there.  Yeah, they want us to break it.  So Screech was talking about a sex tape with Rita Crosby.  Rita Crosby.  Says, Screech, how big is it?  Four years ago, I was...  Wow, her voice has really gotten bad.  A little set up.  Yeah, here's Screech explaining he was part of a group of celebrities who made sex tapes as a game.  Stop it.  Four years ago, I was part of a club of high-profile people that we treated it like a poker game. 
[01:54:30]  We called it Pokem.  We thought it was fun to videotape exploits and then put money into a pot and then score different things you could accomplish on tape  and give point totals to it.  And then the one with the highest point total at the end of the month would get the pot of money.  Oh, no.  And so it could have been any...  Over four years, it could have been misplaced.  Someone could have shown it to a friend during a drunken night or something. 
[01:55:00]  And that friend was an opportunist.  An angry girlfriend could have found it.  I don't think anyone directly involved with the group would have done it themselves, though,  because they wouldn't want their name out there.  Really?  You don't think Corey Haim would?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, Corey Haim or...  We finally got to read it.  Everyone's talking over.  We had a comment on the Screech portion, though.  Yeah.  Because it was just...  He's lying, by the way.  That's obviously...  He put this out to get money.  To get money.  Just stop it already.  Everyone that's bombing, that needs cash quick, all of a sudden a sex tape appears out of nowhere 
[01:55:30]  and they talk about, I don't know how it got out.  Well, what does she have to say?  What do you think they grew up with?  Him?  Alan Thicke?  Yeah, who else is in this group?  I don't think it's probably a good call.  The girlfriend from Wonder Years.  Oh, no, the little Jewish boy with the big nose from Wonder Years.  Yeah, him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It can't be anybody.  Hall was his name, was it?  Nancy from Facts of Life.  Mindy Cohen. 
[01:56:00]  Mindy Cohen.  From Facts of Life.  It's that one.  Mindy Cohen.  Oh, my God.  Look what I do to this guy.  This ought to be worth some points.  She wins every week.  They've done it themselves, though, because they wouldn't want their name out there.  You know, obviously part of a game.  I can't.  You know, everybody.  Everybody's saying.  Oh, my God.  Does this woman have a frigging lozenge endorsement yet?  Her name out there.  You know, obviously part of a game, and I don't want you to be too graphic, but from 
[01:56:30]  what I understand, it's pretty sexually explicit.  She's learned how to use her voice, too.  She deepens it up so it doesn't sound so crappy, but occasionally it does get so slow.  Let me tell her.  I'm going to ask you this.  I'm going to ask you this.  Oh, no, man.  How do you do it?  She should just be drinking motor oil every day.  Just lube that.  Lube those vocal cords up.  Lube it up, baby.  They are shot.  How does she elevate to that level?  What happened?  Not pretty enough to have, you know, blown away to the top. 
[01:57:00]  No.  And that awful voice.  How did it happen?  She's a great journalist?  You know how hot you have to be for that voice to be hot?  Like that smoky barroom voice on a really hot chick?  Well, Demi Moore.  But Demi Moore was like, yeah, she was hot, and the voice wasn't nearly this bad.  That's what I'm saying, but it's in that same category.  She has to deepen it up to get the rasp out.  Yeah.  You know, obviously part of a game, and I don't want you to be too graphic, but from  what I understand, it's pretty sexually explicit. 
[01:57:30]  And what, two women in there, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Just right out of there, right?  Two women in there, right?  I can't breathe anymore.  Your turn.  All the interviews is just like that pause.  And then the one, do you agree?  In there, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm just, sorry, I'm laughing at the way you talk.  Yeah, fella.  We were very rambunctious.  And any sexual exploits are explicit by nature, right?  Oh, ah, very good, Screech.  Yes, very explicit. 
[01:58:00]  All right, we'll take a break.  We'll get petrified vocal cords.  We'll continue with the Screech interview with Rita Crosby after the break.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  Hey, what's up?  It's Louis, Twitchell's, Santani.  Shut up!  Tourette's Day is coming to the Opie and Anthony Show,  which is to say that we've discovered a new excuse to point and laugh at people who are different.  To help us understand a little bit more about Tourette's,  we've enlisted the help of hearing-impaired Chicago reporter Karen Meyer.  Tourette's been drawn into a new radical disorder.  They're scared twice by involuntary sticks and repeated vocalizations.

[01:59:00]  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Patrice O'Neal now lounging on a couch for the last 15 minutes of this portion of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, yeah.  Dan, you want to repeat what you said about Patrice O'Neal?  Yeah, why don't you, buddy?  Go ahead.  Because I don't think Patrice heard you.  Go ahead, Dan.  Ow!  Well, just with you lounging like that, I refer to you as Cleofatra.  Oh! 
[01:59:30]  You know what, Dan?  God bless him, that abused Negro.  Good one, Kunta.  Speaking of Cleofatra, the Fatty Pig Fatty contest is moving along.  We might have to just end it early or something.  I don't know.  We got a winner so early.  Yeah, we got two weeks left in this contest.  So, come on.  Let's step it up a little bit.  We're looking for the fattest girl to come through that door and show us what she's got. 
[02:00:00]  And the winner's going to win $10 a pound, courtesy of H57 Hootia.  Lose weight for free at H57.com.  And we have $1,000 finder's fee for the person that brings in the fatty.  Right now, you've got to beat 430 pounds.  That's Crystal from Cleveland.  She was a real trooper.  She was great.  So, bag yourself a pig.  Bring her in.  You both walk out of here with...  Yeah, someone surprised us.  Let's get a nice fat girl over at XM today.  Come on.  Come on.  We'll be nice.  A biggin'.  We beg you.  All right, back to... 
[02:00:30]  Rita Crosby.  Right.  Oh, my God, Screech.  People adored you growing up as this character, Screech.  And Saved by the Bell.  And how are you giving a girl a dirt...  What you...  It's called Saved by the Smell because you give a girl a dirty...  A dirty...  Oh, that just feels...  It just feels like it hurts.  Yeah, it's uncomfortable to watch is what it is.  Does she strain actually with her own voice? 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  Or is it pretty fluent?  Or does it look uncomfortable watching her talk?  It looks uncomfortable.  It looks like she's in pain talking.  What's wrong with her?  Why is she like that?  Is that just it?  Ugly.  No.  I don't know.  No disease?  No throat?  Yeah, ugly.  It's got to be...  Ugly ripped down into your throat.  It's polyps.  Ugly ripped down into your throat.  To your throat.  She got the ugly ripped.  It's got to be polyps.  It's polyps popping like popcorn in that throat of hers.  They're just popping up everywhere.  Yeah.  You think it's polyps?  No.  It's got to be, right?  You can get them cut off.  Why wouldn't you get them cut off?  Oh my God, it might affect my voice, my career. 
[02:01:30]  I can't do that.  All right.  He wasn't worried about the tape being released.  This is Screech talking.  What does he have to be worried about?  It's not like...  He's not an A-list celebrity.  He wants the attention, right?  Yeah.  And he needs money.  Weren't you worried that this would get out?  I mean, you're doing a game with other people having the tape.  Weren't you worried that it could be made public?  Does it look like what's going to happen next?  Now she's almost putting on a Kermit thing in order to keep from sounding like... 
[02:02:00]  Because if she talks normal, it's like this.  So she's got to cut a sucker voice in.  How does she have a job?  You think she has meetings about her voice?  Like they just go read it.  Like Rita, you've got to do something.  I mean, you know, you're a smart girl.  You're, you know, you get the subject, but people want to hear about that.  You think when the camera's off her, she's just gargling olive oil?  Just anything?  Something.  It's about time we got on to read it.  Because now she's getting this thing going where it's different. 
[02:02:30]  It's not as crackly, but it's completely, equally as ridiculous.  A woman talking like this.  I have no idea what she said.  Sounds like a tranny trying to sound like a woman.  Yeah.  So we've got to start over again.  Here we go.  Weren't you worried that this would get out?  I mean, you're doing a game with other people having the tape.  Weren't you worried that it could be made public?  Like what's going to happen now?  No, because I had tapes of them too.  So, I mean, it was, it was a mutual trust thing.  I mean, I wouldn't, I wouldn't reveal their tapes and they wouldn't reveal mine.  And I didn't think that anyone would actually keep them. 
[02:03:00]  I mean, you figured you'd just erase them or, you know.  Who wants to see an Eric Boghossian porno anyway?  You think he was one of the group?  He explains why he signed with Red Light District.  Oh, that's a good, that's a good.  They're distributing the tape, right?  They're good, though.  They're very good.  Yeah.  You did not sell this tape.  I mean, do you have any role whatsoever in releasing this video?  No, but at the same time, yesterday, we, we talked with our, our friends over at Red Light District and, and David Joseph over there. 
[02:03:30]  We, we sat down.  It was a battle of, David Hahn Schmidt had received the tape that we could spend a fortune fighting it in court with little bits already being leaked out on the internet and everything else.  Or we could suck it up and say, you know what?  It could be a losing battle.  We'll make money. 
[02:04:00]  We'll just side with it.  That's the, how many people?  Since no one's watching Saved by the Bell anymore.  You know, this guy is the biggest liar.  With it, with it leaking out onto the internet, this guy, he pushed send.  Yeah, this is everything, everything that happened, he did.  You're right, man.  And I, I think they tracked it back to the, where, his hometown or whatever, where this came from, the leak.  The leak.  Stop.  And he's, and he's packing.  Yeah.  Huh?  And he's packing wood.  He's packing. 
[02:04:30]  That's what they say.  Yeah.  Yeah.  People are saying.  Does Rita, does Rita bring that up?  Now you're packing a lot of wood.  Is that, is that something that was going to make this tape worth seeing?  Can I just have to knock some of these pops off the back of my throat?  Yeah.  Jesus, look at Vinny.  Wow, Vinny.  He can't even do an impression because his voice is all screwed up, too.  Sounds like Kermit, but he has no problem making fun of Rita.  Vinny sounds like a young Rita Cosby.  Right.  I'm just proud that Vinny's finally taking shots at somebody. 
[02:05:00]  Every time he's on our show, we go down this road.  That's what you guys do.  You guys sit in the back of the bus.  I don't sit there.  It was already the retard stuff.  I was branded a bad guy for not doing retard jokes.  Right.  You aren't branded.  You guys make fun of retards.  I got to figure out what flowers I'm buying my wife today.  Vinny tried to do a Rita Cosby impression.  I didn't know.  He just did him.  She's doing me. 
[02:05:30]  All right.  Finally, Screech says the only good past is that.  What?  Screech says the only good past is that he's proud of his prowess.  All right.  Oh, it's Jimmy.  All right.  Are you, though, obviously a little embarrassed at yourself now?  You look, it was a game back then.  And then you think, oh, God, all this is going to be coming out visually.  People are going to be clicking onto this.  You know, like I said, people are going to dig and dig and dig.  I'm not a druggie.  I'm not a drunk.  I've never been arrested.  I made a sex tape when I was younger with a group of guys that we thought was funny. 
[02:06:00]  It was stupid.  That sounds good.  And that's the only thing I can be accused of is I made a stupid choice way back when.  If I have to look at a positive aspect of having made a video and having it been released to the public,  I think that, you know, I mean, I'm proud of myself, prowess speaking.  I mean, so it's nothing to be embarrassed about.  I guess life could be worse.  He's just so excited that people are talking about it again. 
[02:06:30]  He's proud.  He was on our show, and he was labeled worst guest ever to appear on the opening of the show.  Yeah.  I had nothing to talk about.  He sucks as a comic, too.  Yeah.  He's not in a comic, yeah.  No.  He'd just make pornos.  He'd make a lot of money.  Really bad.  Well, this is what it's come down to.  He wants to still be in the public eye.  He can't make it on TV anymore.  He can't make it with his comedy.  So this is what he does.  Hope you make a fortune.  Yeah.  Everyone's saying they want to see Tara Reid interviewed by Rita Crosby.  Tara, your show is canceled.  What are you going to do in the future? 
[02:07:00]  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's something I've got to do.  They were sending me all over the place.  But it's very difficult for you now to get a job with this whole stigma that you have  as a drunk because you're out every night smoking cigarettes and drinking.  Well, that's true, Rita.  But I think there's still a lot of people that want to see Tara Reid.  Are there?  Yes, there are.  Who's talking right now?  I have no idea.  I'll do the voice like this.  Just two horrific women voices. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, my God, you guys.  Oh, my God, you guys.  We've got to take a break.  Oh, my God, you guys.  We're taking a break.  Oh, my goodness.  You've got to love her.  How can somebody with a voice so distracting just have a job?  It's completely distracting.  I don't care what she's saying.  And it's worse to watch than it is to just hear it because she is straining.  Is she old?  And you're like, it can't be.  No, it's just that she's not an old broad. 
[02:08:00]  All right.  I mean, she's a little chunky.  All right.  Let's see.  Let's see.  I think we did just about everything we needed to do over here.  Let's not forget our Letterman thing is re-airing tomorrow night.  Oh, that's right.  Let's see.  What else?  Tigers in the World Series.  We talked about that.  Of course.  Mets won last night.  Hawaiian earthquake.  We had nothing on that.  Who cares?  No one cares.  Although they're saying it's one of the biggest earthquakes in recent years.  Right behind the L.A. earthquake, by the way.  Yeah, but apparently we really don't consider Hawaii a state.  It would be all over the news. 
[02:08:30]  Like, right now, if there was an earthquake of that magnitude in California, it would be all over the news.  They would show it.  It would be constantly playing.  Right.  Hawaii, it's just like, eh.  We don't care.  Closed.  No one cares about that except aging hippies.  CBGB's has been closing for 20 years.  It finally happened.  A couple of AIDS victims from 72.  Yeah.  Like, the owner was bitching about it, and he's 74 with lung cancer, and he's sitting there just saying, you know, it's a horrible day that we've got to close CBGB's. 
[02:09:00]  Did anyone give a crap about that place after, like, 1981?  Like I said, it's been closing for 20 years.  It finally happened.  And if people still wanted to go there, the place would still be there, is what it comes down to.  There's something about the lease, anyway.  Yeah, they're arguing about it.  Well, because they're raising their rent.  It started at $600 a month back when they opened.  Because they're pushing them out to get the condos in that area.  Now it's something like $64,000 a month that they're supposed to pay.  He's going to try to reopen in Vegas, whatever.  Yeah.  Whatever.  He can get some more junkies to go in there. 
[02:09:30]  Good luck to you.  More bathrooms with stuff on the wall.  Hattie Smith played, and it was just, like, her mustache.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's a big looking broad.  Wow.  Yeah.  Did you see the picture?  Oh, my God.  Did I ever.  I want to thank the father from Little People Big World for doing the show with us today.  Someone out there is appreciating that.  A.K.A.  Rita Crosby, A.K.A.  Kermit DeFront.  A.K.A.  Midget Father from Little People Big World.  Bob in New York, what's up?  We end with you, I guess.  A.K.A. 
[02:10:00]  Ray Romano.  Yeah, I've got a 541-pound black girl who wants to try out for the contest.  Dude, that's $5,410.  What the hell is she waiting for?  For her, and $1,000 for you for bringing her in.  Right, and her concern is coming down there and being outweighed by four or five pounds  at the end of the contest.  How is that going to happen?  Get her ass down here.  We've had this 440-pound woman, right?  30.  30, whatever.  Well, just in case there's a 440-pounder that's in her car right now. 
[02:10:30]  I don't want to wreck it for everybody.  430, that's still like been, she's had the lead.  For two weeks, two and a half weeks now.  When's the contest up with?  I guess we're going to end Halloween.  Halloween.  Where are you guys?  Upstate New York.  Well, get your ass down here, man.  It's $1,000 for you.  And if she wins, $5,400.  Roll that girl down the thruway.  Come on.  Hold on the line.  We've got to talk you into this.  All right.  And make sure she knows we'll be nice to her.  Ride that animal down Route 17. 
[02:11:00]  She's ready?  What town are you in?  Binghamton.  It's what, three and a half hours maybe?  Yeah.  Isn't that worth the...  She just doesn't want to make an ass of herself, then be beat out by a 540-pounder on Halloween.  All right, Bob, let me tell you something.  I would love for someone even bigger than 541 pounds to come in.  I'm telling you right now, my money's on this girl winning everything.  I don't think we go higher than 541.  She's a quarter of a ton.  Yeah.  I don't think we go higher than 541.  We're talking the winner of the contest.  You see her. 
[02:11:30]  Putting those terms.  Now, can we come down Halloween day?  No.  No, come down before that.  Let's make it interesting.  Bring that bitch down and hold the onions.  I want extra pickles and cheese.  I have confidence that she'll win.  How about this?  If she comes in second or third place, what is she going to get?  How about this?  Someone talked to age 57.  H57.com, and see if they'll just give you $1,000 for showing up.  That's what I'd say today.  H57.  So you're guaranteed $1,000, and then if you win the whole thing, we'll throw all that 
[02:12:00]  other money at you.  Hold on the line, man.  We got a wheel and deal, man.  Did we say H57, oh?  H57, yeah.  Jesus.  Did y'all already talk about that was Heinz 57 sauce?  H57.  I can't compete with that.  That's the ketchup diet.  Of course you're eating less.  So if we bring her down and she's five over...  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Someone work with this guy.  We need to get this lady down here. 
[02:12:30]  She's going to win the whole thing.  Who's beating 541?  Yeah, someone says she walks around town every day not being embarrassed by being 540 pounds,  but she won't come into the studio.  No, she's not embarrassed.  She doesn't want to waste her time thinking she comes down here, shows off what she's  got, and then she loses by four pounds.  That's her problem.  Get down here.  I say that I think she wins the whole thing.  I really do.  I don't see anyone beating that.  I would love for someone to be, you know, fatter.  You want the biggest mess, you know.  Certainly do.  Fatty pig fatty. 
[02:13:00]  You got to love it.  We'll talk about that over at XM.  Today's football picks were sponsored by Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  Vinnie Brandt, thank you so much.  Are you promoting anything besides that fine comedy club of yours?  No, no.  What are you going to do?  I'm doing some fundraiser on Friday for Operation Smile.  Making money for people.  What do you want me to tell you?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I'm trying to make money for kids.  That can't smile?  No, these are bad.  Shut up.  Well, let me ask you.  I didn't ask you. 
[02:13:30]  Vinnie's a good guy.  Go see Patrice.  He's a good guy.  He's doing comedy so kids can smile.  Oh, they don't have the face muscles?  No, they're bad.  They're like people with a 200-pound tumor.  In where?  On their face.  Jesus.  I swear to God, there's something like that.  Yeah, no, I never want to.  Wow.  Hey, everybody.  Vinnie's just a good guy.  Vinnie, 200-pound tumors. 
[02:14:00]  Hey, come on, folks.  Hey, kid, where are you from?  I don't know.  Help me.  Vinnie's just a good guy.  And he runs a great comedy club down there in New Brunswick.  I haven't been there in a while, Vinnie.  I'm going to stop by and check out one of the shows in the near future.  Are you lying?  I am not lying.  How many times have I been in your club, Vinnie?  You've been there a lot.  Thank you.  And you would have come this weekend if Patrice let anyone know, but he didn't want to make 
[02:14:30]  any money.  I did.  I was lying about Stand Up New York the last time you were here, but that's what I'm not  lying about.  He comes in.  Patrice, what do you got?  Anything?  Yeah, I'm doing Helium in Philly in November.  November.  San Francisco in November.  November.  I'm doing something next week.  You have a website where these dates are?  I'm trying to help you out.  Yeah, patriceonell.com.  I'm going on there.  My space, whatever.  I'm at the comic strip this weekend.  And if you want to bang Patrice and his chick, where do they go? 
[02:15:00]  I don't know.  Badhole.com.  Go to Patrice's MySpace.  Slip you a note at the show or something.  All right, throw a note in his back pocket.  No stalky white girls.  All right.  Patrice, you killed for us.  We continue over at XM.  Oh, yeah.  If you're not joining us over there, have a great day.  See you over there.  See you over there.  The Opie and Anthony Fatty Pig Fatty Contest began like a stampede of hungry rhinos. 
[02:15:30]  But now it more closely resembles a sleepy, winded elephant.  The current heavyweight in the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest is Crystal from Cleveland, who weighed in at 430 pounds.  We're so sure there's someone bigger out there.  We put up a fatty finder's fee in the amount of $1,000 to the person who brings in the heaviest girl by the end of the contest. 
[02:16:00]  So grab your sonar equipment and find us a whale.  Remember, the heaviest girl at the end of the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest gets $10 for every floorboard-shattering, tear-inducing, self-esteem-destroying pound on her body.  Fat bottom girl, she'll make the rockin' world go round.  Go to opieandanthony.com for contest details.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  I sound low. 
[02:16:30]  It doesn't work.  Can you hear me?  Is it low?  I don't know.  Sometimes the music's loud, right?  Yeah.  And then you can't hear yourself until you crank up the volume and it blows your eardrum out.  Where's she from?  Where are you from?  Colorado Springs.  Colorado Springs.  Colorado Springs.  I went there once.  Very nice.  Jared.  Say hi to Jared in Colorado.  You just been.  Hi, Jared.  That's where white girls say my mother's rape.  Vacation in New York.  Very nice.  I'm going to Denver.  That's where they get Cobster.  The Cobster over there. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  I've been there.  Thank you, sir.  Hi, puppy.  Look at the doggie.  The guy ties him up every day on that short little leash.  Look how, yeah.  The old man that looks like he's from the Six Flags commercials.  What happened to Andrew, man?  I don't know how this guy took over Andrew's spot.  This guy kicked Andrew with his ass.  Yeah.  He got a new box, though.  That's a better house than he had.  He's got cat litter outside his box.  Because he's got a cat.  He's one of those homeless guys that uses the animals to try to garner sympathy.  Yeah.  From the people he likes. 
[02:17:30]  It's not for me.  Feed my cat.  Look at the cold-ass Opie.  Yeah, Opie didn't bring a jacket.  Opie really's trying to just, he really tries to be a hero for white guys.  Put a jacket on.  What the fuck, Opie?  I didn't think it was going to be this cold today.  The weather.  Stupid day.  It's on every morning.  Yeah, at four.  And it says that it's going to be 46 degrees in the morning.  And then it's going up to like 60 today.  So you've got to assume by this time it's not hot yet.  When I wake up in the morning, they're still talking about Sunday's weather. 
[02:18:00]  That's how early we get up.  It's still like the Sunday night weather.  Right.  Because I heard this morning, I heard the weather and it said it's 45 degrees going down to 43.  Mets.  Big win last night, bro.  Ow.  Jesus.  Guy punched you right in the hand.  He really slugged you.  I could take a punch, but my God.  Jesus.  He just broke my pinky.  Look at this.  Here's my friend.  But that guy was wearing a brand new Mets cap.  Bandwagon jumper, you think?  That's what I'm thinking.  Yeah.  That's what I'm thinking. 
[02:18:30]  You know what you're going to see?  When.  You cold motherfucker.  Opie is freezing.  I think he's freezing trying to be a soldier.  How many fucking Detroit caps are you going to see after they win the World Series?  If, you know, they win.  That's when you know that whole bandwagon thing is real.  Brand new, crispy Detroit caps.  No one wears Tiger's caps.  Nope.  No one.  What does that mean in the community?  Do you know?  If you wear a Tiger's cap, does that mean something? 
[02:19:00]  Nothing.  All right.  Did you like the Tigers?  Exactly.  Or did you like the colors?  Why is John Cusack's father behind us?  Which team colors am I not allowed to wear as a white guy, Patrice?  What team color?  Yeah.  There's some that is off limits for white guys.  Oakland.  Absolutely not.  You don't wear Oakland.  Like a Portland Trailblazer jersey.  Fucking nothing, man.  Am I safe with that?  Look at this monster.  What the hell are you trying to do?  You're parking in the goddamn crosswalk there, lady. 
[02:19:30]  Look at those legs right there.  Is that too much legs, little white boy?  Uninspected.  We got a cop here.  Give her a ticket.  She's uninspected.  With the mohawk oak.  Which one?  Where am I looking?  This mohawk black girl right here.  Is that too much body?  No.  She's fine.  Yeah, I like that.  You like that?  That right there.  I like that.  She's limping.  Good.  I'm trying to fix it up.  She's limping.  Patrice, show her a picture of your girl.  Maybe she'll dig her girl.  Yeah.  Snapple pussy right back in the place. 
[02:20:00]  She's got to be a fan of yours.  Oh, she took a picture of you.  Yeah.  Because we don't get the black girls.  Hey, would you be number four?  Are you a fan of Patrice or us?  Yeah.  Oh, I knew that.  Patrice.  That was easy.  Me and my girlfriend are still single.  Look at this look.  Oh, yeah.  Look at the look.  Yeah.  She gave me the look.  You could be number four.  Yeah.  That's right.  You could be number four.  I probably have to treat her with too much respect.  She's already making excuses. 
[02:20:30]  Talk to a boy in five minutes.  I don't want it to happen.  You just want some kind of magical shit to happen.  Look at this.  This is nice.  A little third world look here.  What's up, gorgeous?  All right, Kenny.  Invite some of these people up.  I'm going right in today.  Yeah.  Too cold out here.  I want to grab some soup.  The Colorado Springs couple.  And then whoever else is from out of town.  We'll let you upstairs and check out the show.  All right.  Second half of the Open Anthony program about to begin with Patrice O'Neill and Vinnie Brandt. 
[02:21:00]  Stay there.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps.  Ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow.  How long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right. 
[02:21:30]  All right.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Cornwall.  Three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  Opie.  No, I can't have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt. 
[02:22:00]  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll see you next time.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Thank you.  We'll see you next time. 
[02:22:30]  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  You'll see you next time.  And it's not happy.  No, I love the soup, man.  I really love the soup, man. 
[02:23:00]  Because it's delicious soup.  It's delicious.  I want a banana and a parfait.  But I wanted chicken chili.  Now, they got split pea.  I don't like split pea soup.  Ever since I was a kid, wah, no.  I don't like split pea.  And then they got, like, shrimp bisque, which I'm sure is good.  But it's a little too, you know, thick and creamy and stuff.  I wanted the goddamn chicken chili. 
[02:23:30]  Or the turkey chili.  Which one are you getting, fan?  Broccoli?  Yeah, and then they put broccoli and cheese.  You're eating the broccoli.  I don't want broccoli and cheese either.  Look, I love the soup, man.  I would never touch broccoli and cheese.  Now, Than is going to eat it and love it.  You're a fan of broccoli and cheese soup?  Good stuff, but I enjoy certain types of soup.  Why can't they include those?  Now, someone's going to have to go back to the soup man and get soup for me. 
[02:24:00]  Special soup.  Where's your plebe?  Now, I've got to eat dry bread because I'm hungry in the morning like some kind of prisoner.  I'm drinking bread and eating bread.  I'm drinking bread.  I'm drinking water and eating bread.  Bread and water.  Do you understand?  I am a thousandaire.  Why didn't we get good soup? 
[02:24:30]  Who's in charge of the soup?  They are.  They send it over.  Yeah.  Who dictates what soup goes in in the morning?  Do we know?  Is there a name?  Is there a name?  No.  I'm assuming it's somebody on their side.  I don't want to be angry with that person because it could also be split pea and spit soup.  So, I don't ever want that to start.  No, never.  But, I really would like some chicken chili soup.  You know.  Oh, man. 
[02:25:00]  You got club soda Kenny all stressed out.  No.  It's one phone call.  You sure?  It's a phone call.  But, in the interim, I would like a smoothie.  Kenny came to my abode today.  Did he?  Was he cleaning?  He was so bummed out that he couldn't find any fruit for my cereal today.  Wow.  He was stressed.  Look, yeah.  Yeah.  How's that Denver thing we're talking about?  How's that working?  I hope to have it rectified by today. 
[02:25:30]  What happened?  The thing we're talking about?  The other thing?  The first thing or the second thing?  The first thing.  Yeah, and the other thing.  What happened?  This, that, and the other thing.  The thing with the Denver thing.  Yeah.  What happened?  Yeah.  All right.  What happened?  No, it's going to be all taken care of.  It's taken care of.  Kenny takes care of it.  What happened, though?  No, you just worry about you.  What happened?  This is me and Anthony.  Yeah.  What happened?  I don't question your cut-up strawberries.  What happened?  You don't question Denver.  What happened?  Yeah, no.  What happened?  What happened?  No, there's a little piece of work I got to take care of. 
[02:26:00]  I've also taken to using the services of Mr. Club Soda Kenny.  I told you he's the best.  He is.  I told you.  Absolutely is.  I never doubted it.  Yeah.  That was the greatest.  We stopped eating dry freaking bread.  Do you know, for you to say to stop eating anything, I should be able to sit here and eat  Captain Crunch with no milk into a microphone.  The man that is looking for Cuban hookers right now is the worst.  I think you are. 
[02:26:30]  No way.  No way.  I would say, as far as eating on mic goes, you're worse than Jimmy.  No.  That's personal.  No.  I might be wrong.  No.  You with the scraping of the yogurt cup?  No.  I don't do that anymore.  The public will.  Let me know.  Let me get on pal talk.  I've been shirking my responsibility.  All right.  Sit down, boys.  Hey, you know what we're going to do today, Patrice?  Hello, boys.  In the elevator, you're like, man, we need to, like, maybe keep the magic going at XM.  We need something that'll make this show fly by.  Top 10 country songs. 
[02:27:00]  Haven't done it in a while.  Oh, yeah.  Haven't done it in a while.  I want to talk to my boy, Keith.  Meow, meow, meow, meow.  I hate that shit.  We're doing top 10 country songs today with Patrice O'Neal.  It's a great bit.  My password.  By the way, to finish up on a discussion we had, I think it was about a week ago now.  Ah.  Got a little music for everybody today.  Come again, the sweet of love that I now invite, thy graces that we pray, to do, we do delight. 
[02:27:30]  Here it comes.  To see, to hear, to touch, to kiss, to die.  To die.  What?  Oh.  This is why we're not getting a police reunion tour anytime soon.  Because Sting is now playing the lute.  He's too busy with this drivel. 
[02:28:00]  Jimmy and I went to R's Confidential.  Uh-huh.  I don't know when it's airing.  Maybe someone can help me out.  Because there are people out there that care enough to check out the R's Confidential with Sting.  Playing his lute.  The lute.  Like it's 1,500.  See again, in sweetest silver, I've seen my hair.  To touch, to kiss, to die.  To die.  That's my favorite part. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, that is a real awful line.  Don't step over my favorite part.  So affected.  To die.  To see, to hear, to touch, to kiss.  To die with me.  Oh, and he really worked on making it sound like that.  What a dick.  What a dick bag.  Come again, that I may cease to water.  Hey, would ye like to hear some more?  Fucking Renaissance Fair music. 
[02:29:00]  I bet you Roxanne's like, what happened to this faggot?  Yeah, what happened?  Yeah, where's Roxanne?  Well, at the end of this.  She's back to selling pussy.  Put back on your red light, bitch.  To die.  I got a lute.  To die.  I got a fucking lute now.  They negotiated with Sting to do this R's Confidential on XM.  And they just wanted the guy to play a couple police songs at the end.  Should have kept it confidential.  They wanted to play the police songs at the end to make everyone happy.  And they had to go through hell and back. 
[02:29:30]  And then he finally agreed that he would throw everybody a bone and do one police song and one solo Sting song.  Great, thanks.  And then he did Hell's Hound, I think it's called, by Robert Johnson.  What?  Hell's Hound, I think.  An old blues number.  But before that, we had a listen.  How about you do a message in a bottle?  Yeah.  Roxanne.  And you do the other one.  Don't stand so close to me.  And then, you know, there's plenty to choose from, Sting.  Not... 
[02:30:00]  Do the...  I got to hear it again.  Through thy unkindest shame.  For an elephant forlorn.  I sit, I sigh, I weep, I faint, I die.  Popular song with the brothers.  Someone will fucking sample that shit, though, and turn it into a hip-hop song.  Yeah, where's Jay-Z?  Come on.  Too fucking open for him, the half-goat, half-man boy. 
[02:30:30]  It's...  This shit sucks.  It's Christmas music without the Christmas.  Motherfucking Patrice is dual souping it.  You are dual souping.  I taste the shrimp biz, didn't like it, but this ham and split pea is magnificent.  Ham and pea, split pea?  It's magnificent.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  That broccoli and cheese stinks.  I had to get the, uh...  I had to send out for a special.  They didn't have my chicken chili.  I'm very upset.  All right, let's get a Peter in Massachusetts.  No soup for me.  No soup for me.  Peter. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, good morning.  Good morning.  You fuckers, this song was stuck in my head all last week.  I finally got rid of it, and fucking Monday morning, you play it again.  I hope all week long you're going to be at work miserable, and you're going to hear  that in your head.  To die!  To die!  Let's say hi to Jim in Denver.  Jim.  Jim.  Chad.  Oh, Chad.  Sorry.  What's up? 
[02:31:30]  Hey, boys.  Hey, that kind of sounds like my vagina.  My vagina.  My vagina.  I sit, I sigh, I weep, I faint, I die.  In daily pain, and endless misery.  Let's try now.  Ah.  Faggot.  Let's try now.  To die.  For China.  For China.  Ah, the day, the sun that lands me shine. 
[02:32:00]  My frowns, you cause me pain.  And these mewings.  Here it comes again.  For smiles, the springs that makes my joys to grow.  A frowns, the winter's of my world.  For smiles, the springs that makes my joys to grow.  All right. 
[02:32:30]  A frowns, the winter's of my world.  You sure that's not Vinny telling his wife how much he loves her?  No, not even me.  That's fucking horrible.  This is what Vinny's...  Yeah, this is what Vinny's playing as he gives his flowers to his wife.  To die.  That lute stinks.  Eddie Murphy made it cool to like Sting for like five seconds or two.  What?  Yeah.  From 48 hours.  What do you do?  Yep.  Sing Roxanne.  Sing Roxanne in the jail cell with the Walkman. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  To die.  He didn't do that in like a concert setting, did he?  Huh?  People went to see that?  Yeah, Art's confidential.  Albie went to see it.  Albie went to see it.  Albie, did you think you were going to see Sting doing Sting?  Jim, Jimmy went to see it.  No, I knew all the politicking that was going on.  I knew.  I knew pretty much what was going to happen.  Ah, that's just brutal.  We got to meet him, and then the guy was mad because I took a picture with him in the  flesh didn't work, so I actually went to the back of the line, and then I apologized  really nicely, and I'm like, look, Sting, can I take another one of my flesh didn't work? 
[02:33:30]  And he was so annoyed.  I'm like, wow, I'm sorry.  Jesus.  I got to get back to my flute.  That's terrible.  The lute is the harp if it was cool.  Yeah.  The lute is hoping it was a harp.  Right.  No.  All the night.  I've got to hear how this is.  Do we?  My sleep's are full of dreams.  My eyes are full of streams. 
[02:34:00]  My heart takes no delight.  My heart takes no delight.  It is triumphant return to the park next to this tree with three people listening.  Wearing tights with just a huge cock shoving out the front.  That's what I picture.  Yeah, every night. 
[02:34:30]  That's it.  That was the other song.  Who's that curl in the front?  Yeah, curly shoes.  To die.  Little court jester hat.  Like a blousey type of shirt.  Yeah.  Ooh.  And then a king.  He's just missing a king sitting there.  Yeah.  King sitting there.  Uh-huh.  Brother.  Let's all try it.  You can try it at home.  To die.  You got to like, can we not?  You got to work your voice.  To die.  To die.  If I ever became famous, I wouldn't want to go down so far to where people, like, say  to me, shut the fuck up.  Yeah.  Knock it off.  Like, that's where Michael Jackson is now. 
[02:35:00]  There was a point where that motherfucker, people would cry if they seen him.  Yeah.  They'd see him and just, look at this stupid motherfucker.  Shut up.  All right.  How many yes men around him now?  Springsteen, I saw that metal ends.  He played a harpsichord.  Yes, see?  There's no fucking harpsichord on Born in the USA.  What the fuck?  Oh, it was horrible.  He sang the song into a harmonica.  He yelled into a harmonica.  You couldn't understand the word.  Are these guys out of their fucking minds?  This is the conversation we had when we were talking about Sting.  It's like, you remember these guys.  I was a huge police fan growing up and stuff. 
[02:35:30]  And then these guys get so famous that they think they could go off on these tangents  and charge top dollar to see them when, you know, you and I, you're going to see  Bruce Springsteen and hear fucking Born in Iran.  Go fuck yourself.  Go fucking play that in your castle somewhere with, like, ten of your friends.  Right.  When you saw Springsteen.  Or at least on the ticket, say, well, the ticket prices are, you know, are 50% because  I'm going to be playing a lot of crap that you don't want to hear.  But I'm so famous now.  I get to do whatever the fuck I want.  At Springsteen, we saw him. 
[02:36:00]  You weren't allowed to get beer.  At 10 to 8, no beer sales.  And you weren't allowed to get up to go to the bathroom.  Well, that makes me even better.  Bruce Springsteen show.  Yeah, I swear.  And then.  Back in the day.  Fucking self-important ass.  Back in the day, they were all drunk on stage when they were singing all those songs.  This is the best part.  Everyone around us.  Swinging the fucking whiskey in between songs.  Yeah.  Good.  Everyone around us was sleeping.  It was horrible.  Worst show I've ever seen.  Fucking Neil Young did that to me.  To this day, I'm obsessed and pissed off that I didn't get what I wanted from my Neil Young.  No.  Go fuck yourself.  It doesn't say on the ticket, guess what?  I'm not playing anything you know.  Sorry.  None of the hits. 
[02:36:30]  And guess what?  I'm going to try 10 different instruments tonight because I can.  Yeah.  Self-important.  Self-serving.  I mean, if you're going to do that, you got it.  See, I'm going back to fucking parking lot.  Why?  You got to let us know what's going on.  Here's the best part.  At Springsteen, you couldn't go to the bathroom during a song.  You had to get up while he was talking.  So I'm coming back after the rules.  I swear to God.  During the song.  When you gave your ticket in, they gave you a list of 10 rules.  No.  I swear to God.  Coming back from the bathroom, the lady would not let me go. 
[02:37:00]  And he was talking.  I go, lady, he's talking.  He was singing.  She said he was singing because he was talking while he was strumming some fucking bizarre instrument.  Oh, you dope.  I'd have pissed all over her legs.  Did he have another story about Wendy that we haven't heard yet?  Hey, Wendy, I signed a big record deal.  Did you?  I will.  Shut up.  Who cares, Bruce?  I was born in a place of peace.  What?  They get all positive.  Yeah.  What happens to our rock heroes is what it comes down to. 
[02:37:30]  Bon Jovi's even worse.  He's really.  Really?  Yeah.  He's really pussed out.  He's, you know, he's got the answer.  Is he ever really a man, though?  He has all these political fundraisers at his house and it's like, whatever.  At least on stage, he's still, you know, I'm a cowboy on a steel horse I ride.  Yeah.  He knows what songs we need to hear.  Sing it, monkey boy.  Sing for your supper.  That's right.  Even stupid Paul McCartney.  When he gets out there, you're going to hear Let It Be. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  You came to see Let It Be.  Right.  Not Paul McCartney trying out an opera song.  Yeah.  Or whatever.  playing his wife's old leg.  A couple of sticks.  Well, that would be kind of fun.  That would be a big fucking wooden log.  That would be fun for everybody.  Hey, how are you?  Hey, what's up, Ben?  What's happening?  What's up, Bill?  Not much, man.  I'm just picturing the real hard police, hardcore police man hearing this for the first time.  You know, it's like, what?  Who? 
[02:38:30]  You dick.  You dick.  Well, I was at Desar's Confidential, and everyone was sitting on their hands, and then  we're like, I guess we're supposed to applaud now, because, you know, this thing is, you  know, treating us to his creative energy.  Yeah, because how do you know when a lute song is over?  Well, I told you the story last week.  As soon as it starts, it's over, Johnny.  One of these songs ended, and it didn't end, but the crowd thought it ended and started  clapping, and then the lute player, the main lute player, got so pissed, he puts his 
[02:39:00]  hand up really harshly, like, shut up, we're not done.  Hey, I'm not done.  Don't you know how this song ends?  Don't you know how this song ends?  I don't know, I thought it ended when the two horses passed each other, and one jousted  the other one.  You fucking idiot, this is a 10,000-year-old instrument.  Oh, man.  What's next, the pan flute?  Yeah, the master of the pan flute, Sting.  What's that guy's name?  Zamphir.  Zamphir.  Zamphir.  Zamphir.  He's sold over 7 trillion records. 
[02:39:30]  More than Elvis and the Beatles combined.  KTL records and tapes present.  Zamphir, master of the pan flute.  Now you can see that happening.  Yeah, man, you stole my leotard line.  Ah, you had your leotard with the big cock in the front line?  All right, Phil.  Hey, by the way, I hope you hit that note pretty good.  To Jive.  It's horrible, isn't it?  It's just awful. 
[02:40:00]  All right, fellas.  Lay the wheel.  Does he even know?  Afterwards, does he go, ladies and gentlemen, thank you, and I apologize for being a complete  fat.  Yeah.  I'm sorry for just completely fucking your evening up.  What did tickets do that cost?  Did you have to buy tickets?  No, but, well, I don't know.  People had to buy tickets.  It was a special XM event, because they taped this R's Confidential thing.  But people were going there thinking they were going to hear some police.  You know you do?  You go seek out a police tribute band.  That's good.  You know what the singer looks like, all the rest of the guys kind of look like, and the 
[02:40:30]  band sounds like it.  Yeah.  And then you go, ah, this is just as good.  Better than seeing fucking Sting, because Sting's going to sing shit and play a lute.  Emo F from Staten Island.  Opi, it's called increasing estrogen levels as you get older.  They turn into women.  They turn into women.  They get all sensitive.  Well, finally, two hours in, I guess, Sting decided to play a police song on the lute.  Do we hear a little of that?  Oh, shit.  You want to hear this?  See, good.  Because I didn't, I didn't, I couldn't, I could not even fathom what this would sound 
[02:41:00]  like.  So I'm glad we have a piece of it.  What song?  We should talk about this, too.  I'm sure people have stories out there.  I saw Bob Dylan once back in the day when I was living in Rochester.  He was singing all his songs that you know and love, but you didn't know that.  No.  You had no idea.  Like, people were whispering, like, what song is this?  Yeah.  And someone would have to go, that's Positively 4th Street.  Really?  I've heard Positively 4th Street about a thousand times.  Just as angry.  I have no freaking clue.  Positively not it?  Well, no. 
[02:41:30]  Well, Bob Dylan, he likes to get up there and just completely do the song completely different.  If it's a fast song, he slows it down and it's, I don't know.  I don't even like when the words don't line up like they do on the album.  Because then you try to sing along.  I don't go to concerts.  And you're all fucked up.  I hate it because I want to hear what it sounds like on the radio.  Just like the record.  That impresses the shit out of me.  When a band can get on stage and do it exactly like you hear it on the fucking CD.  That's why I don't go see Rap Live.  It's like, I can't enjoy Rap Live.  Rap Live is so bad. 
[02:42:00]  Rap Live?  Those five brothers marching around the stage, stepping on each other, blurting lines out.  It's not mixed right.  It don't sound right.  Just sticking on albums, man.  You're getting shot.  Yeah, I was going to say, a good drive-by.  You're getting shot in the audience.  Beaten up and robbed because you're white and I'm there.  What's that really famous Bob Dylan song?  That really famous.  I mean, help me out.  Like a role.  Right.  Like a role song.  He did that at this show.  Oh, the one that.  Wait, the one that he actually tried to sing on. 
[02:42:30]  Lay, lay, lay, lay, lay across my big brass bed.  It's like, wait a minute.  This isn't Dylan.  And that's unfair to a motherfucker.  Like, I'm a pseudo rock fan.  You know, I like a few.  Like, if I went to see Lev Zeppelin or something, man, I don't want to see these motherfuckers,  you know.  Let the sun be down.  Down, down, down, down, down, down.  No.  You don't mind if, like, they take one and fuck around with it.  Nah, man.  I mean, that's how I feel.  But I'm more like Anthony.  You want to hear how the songs, you know, how you've heard them a million times. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  If they want to experiment with one for a little bit and then jam a bit, whatever.  That's fine.  In my life, anyway.  You don't want to hear the hits that you know and love bastardized.  Butchered.  Yeah.  Completely butchered.  And Zeppelin was a great one for that.  Zeppelin sounded like the record for ten minutes.  And then something happened with Robert Plant and he couldn't fucking hit the notes anymore.  Yeah, it was called heroin.  Was it heroin?  And what did he inject it into his throat?  Probably.  Fucking Rita Crosby singing fucking Zeppelin. 
[02:43:30]  The guy couldn't hit the notes anymore.  So they tuned.  Only Patti LaBelle.  They tuned him down, right?  Yeah.  Aretha Frank.  Only black women could sound just like their records.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Only, only, only.  I think a lot of them might be able to.  They think it's artistic.  They're not.  That's the whole problem.  I'm like, Springsteen, the concert I saw, he's like, well, let me reinterpret this.  No, no, no.  I want you to not reinterpret.  Don't.  Do the fucking song.  Stop it.  Hey, someone's talking about Tool.  You're right.  Scarecrow from Houston.  Have you seen Tool?  They even make the guitarist's feedback match the album. 
[02:44:00]  Very true.  See, that's what you want.  All right.  Well, here is Sting on the lute doing a police classic by everyone haters.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Who's clapping?  Thank you.  Get the fuck out.  That's horrible.  I can't tell you what that is.  Name the song.  Oh, God.  No.  I can't fucking come close.  No.  Don't stand so close to me.  I'm guessing.  Yeah.  Tell me when you recognize the song.  Raise your hand, okay? 
[02:44:30]  Okay.  Don't stand so close to me.  Nope.  That's.  We're 15 seconds in.  Message in a bottle.  You recognize it, though?  I recognize one note.  One note.  I fucking recognize the note.  I didn't just pull that out of my ass.  Get the fuck out of here.  I fucking got it.  I could name that tune in one note.  Name that tune. 
[02:45:00]  I got news for you.  Now that I heard it that much, it's really fucking good that way.  You're kidding, right?  No, it's horrible.  But I did recognize it.  I barely hear it now.  Barely.  Just a cast away.  They didn't know.  They didn't know. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  No, they didn't know.  Because when you're in that situation and you finally recognize the guitar part of that  song, you start going crazy.  I'll tell you one thing.  Thank God.  I'll tell you one thing.  The fucking vocal kicks in.  That is cool.  Now that's what people, all of a sudden, they freaked out at because that's what they wanted  to hear all night.  With that voice singing the songs they fucking know.  Because he's using his Sting voice, too.  God damn, that sounded good.  Not to die.  That really sounded fucking good. 
[02:46:00]  His vocal.  Yeah.  See, now he changes it.  I know.  He loots it up.  He loots it up.  He tricked him.  He fucking tricked him.  He did.  He gave that first line.  It was like, wow, that's good.  Excuse me before I fall into despair.  Too late.  Dispale. 
[02:46:30]  Dispale.  I'll send dinosaurs to the world.  I'll send dinosaurs to the world.  I hope that someone gets my.  I hope that someone gets my.  I hope that someone gets my.  That message.  I hope you sing it like it was.  That message should read, never see Sting.  He sucks.  You can fuck.  Roxanne. 
[02:47:00]  You better fuck.  Here.  Roxanne.  You don't have to hear about a red light.  That's a leak.  Those days are over.  You don't have to sell your body to the nun.  Put an ocean in the back.  Roxanne.  You don't have to put on a red light. 
[02:47:30]  Roxanne.  You don't have to put on a red light.  Don't stand so close to me.  To me.  I can't.  I can't.  I can't stand losing.  Proper English ass.  Perfectly enunciating douche.  Oh, wait.  That's Steve.  I can't.  I can't. 
[02:48:00]  I can't stand production.  I can't.  I can't.  Message in the bottle.  Oh.  You can really hear what it takes to turn when it works.  Oh, yeah.  He sang that first fucking line the way the song goes, right? 
[02:48:30]  To rope you in.  I can't.  I can't keep me together.  Love can mend your life.  But love can break your heart.  I'll send dinosaurs to the world.  I'll send dinosaurs to the world.  I hope that someone gets my, I hope that someone gets my, I hope that someone gets my message. 
[02:49:00]  Message.  Message.  It's not how you sing it, idiot.  Message.  Now everyone's all disappointed sitting there.  You know everyone that went, woo, at the beginning, sitting there going, oh, fuck.  He turned this into shit, too.  Art is confidential.  We didn't know the show was going to suck.  Keep that quiet. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  Keep it on the QT.  That's the confidential part.  This sucks.  When I saw the Springtee show.  One sec.  Playing a lute.  A million bottles washed up on the shore.  Seems I'm not alone in being alone.  Oh, that's the oldest thing.  Another line.  He gave us two good lines.  A million cast away.  Looking for a home. 
[02:50:00]  I'll send dinosaurs to the world.  I'll send dinosaurs to the world.  I hope that someone gets mine.  Yeah, we know.  I hope that someone gets mine.  I hope that someone gets mine.  I'm still here.  Goes on for another.  Of course it does.  Jesus, man.  Oh, that's just.  Holy shit. 
[02:50:30]  Brother Joe.  Elkabong him with that lute.  Brother Joe.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I don't know, man.  Sting takes it to the extreme and it really sucks when he does it.  But a lot of guys, what they'll do is they'll change things up just because they get so fucking bored.  You know what?  They get bored.  But the people that are paying for the tickets, they may be seeing them once, twice.  Right.  So they want to see.  And I know when I go to a concert, I want to fucking see and hear the record.  That's it.  I don't want to fucking, I don't want your experimentation thrown in that you could do at home in your studio. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  Well, he doesn't play at home in his studio for, you know, for money, for live money.  You know, he's got to do.  You know, Ant, when a musician goes on tour, it's the same thing over and over.  Yeah, it gets boring.  That's why they're getting paid so much money to fucking do it.  Yeah.  Not to be self-serving.  And that is so selfish as an artist.  But you should do a special, you know what you should do?  If you do that, you should do a special, when you're that famous, you should do a special venue, you know, where you go, this is Sting. 
[02:51:30]  This is exactly what you're going to get.  Let everyone know.  Let everyone know.  That's all.  Doing shitty things and experimental things and being good.  With all the money that Sting gets thrown at him, you think he gives a shit about, you know, who's doing what?  Obviously not.  See, he wants to get top price for his tickets still.  That's why he's not going to tell you what you're going to get.  Yeah, true.  You know.  How much money do you need?  A lot of bands do it right, though.  A lot of bands do it well.  Like, well, yeah, U2. 
[02:52:00]  They, you know, they break out acoustic versions of some songs that everyone's used to hear on Electric.  Yeah, but they got eight billion hits.  And they'll be on stage.  And they'll play all those good hits.  There's a reason why U2 is still great.  They know exactly what their audience wants when you go to that show.  It's also a good show.  They're working.  It's one anthem after another.  They know exactly how to play these songs.  Hello, hello.  No, Vertigo.  They perform Vertigo exactly as they're supposed to. 
[02:52:30]  Right.  Hello, hello.  Hello, Vertigo.  You never heard the banjo version of Vertigo.  There is a banjo version.  I swear to God.  But they did it as a goof or like one of those YouTube videos or something.  They did a banjo version of Vertigo.  It was pretty funny, actually.  If they tried to do that live on stage, it'd be pelted.  Joe, I don't have your guitar song here.  Oh, oh well.  Well, I have, I can't even say, Guitarther Park.  Guitarther Park is one of them. 
[02:53:00]  Guitarther Park.  Yeah.  MacArthur Park.  Follow up to the Guitar Father.  But you said there's another one that's even better.  Yeah, that was A Taste of Honey.  You want me to send it over to Steve?  Do we have it?  You send it to Steve.  Did you send it?  Yeah, sure.  I'll send it right now.  All right, cool.  Yeah, we'll play that.  All right, fellas.  All right, man.  Talk to you soon.  Bye, man.  Later.  Oh, my God, why?  It's not going to change. 
[02:53:30]  I'm hearing it.  Please?  Can we stop it or something?  No.  Because it's really, really bad.  What station would this be played on on XM?  Do we have XM Shit?  Watercolor.  Is that a station?  XM Shit.  Watercolor.  Watercolor.  Suicide, 203.  Yeah, music is going to fucking bleed out by. 
[02:54:00]  Could you send the SOS out to your other two bandmates in the form of a,  can we get a reunion concert together?  Because this really ain't working, Sting.  Imagine Andy Summers and Stuart Copeland just sitting at home practicing their instruments,  going, well, any day now, he'll fucking call us.  Calling up and going, can you play a lute instead of the guitar?  You've got to be done with this nonsense by now. 
[02:54:30]  Is anybody out there, like, that supports this, though?  I'm sure.  This?  This whole thing.  So few.  This whole thing.  You know what?  This is like classical stuff.  This is in that classical genre.  You know what, though?  Here's what happens.  Sting puts out this album.  It fucking tanks.  He realizes, uh, I got to go back to the old, uh, the old shit.  And then they do a reunion.  They're clapping because it's Sting.  If that was fucking John Smith up there playing a lute, people would have walked out. 
[02:55:00]  That couldn't be played in a fucking restaurant.  Only if they were surprised that it was John Smith, the lute player.  The lute player.  If they went to go see John, the luteist, it would be different.  But if it was like this, let's go see this dude, John Smith.  This mother, I heard he's a hard-rocking motherfucker.  Yeah, he rocks, man.  Listen to some of the old shit.  Sounds like the police.  Let's see.  Guys, this proves you're not tools for the company.  This is Earthbrown, FBA from Buffalo.  Oh, we are. 
[02:55:30]  XM did a lot of work to get Sting, and you guys rip it all up.  I can imagine XM management not being too happy with these anti-Sting breaks.  Screw them, too.  We have a lifeboat like we care.  Sting and Buffalo.  We work for two companies now.  We work for two companies.  Both of them can go fuck themselves.  Not at once, though.  That's right.  One at a time, if you're listening.  Just one at a time.  All right, why don't we take a break?  Yes. 
[02:56:00]  Men at work played songs with harps.  All right, whatever.  Who cares?  Who cared then?  Whip it good.  Do, do, do, do, do, do.  We're going to take a break.  Whip it.  Grab that whip.  Into shape.  Shape it up.  Get straight.  Go forward.  Go forward.  Move ahead.  Whip it good.  Bling, bling, bling, bling, bling.  Bling, bling.  Bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling. 
[02:56:30]  Come on, Eileen.  Oh, I swear.  Come on, Eileen.  At this moment.  You mean everything to everything.  Okay, this is going to lead into one of our...  Come on, Eileen.  Oh, oh, oh.  Bling, bling, bling, bling.  This leads to one of our favorite things to do when Patrice is here.  Top ten country songs in America.  Basically, we read...  We don't know anything about country songs.  We have a lot of truckers that are into the country music that listen to us. 
[02:57:00]  So they love this because they see how just stupid we are when it comes to this genre.  But basically, we give the title of the song and then we try to figure out what the song is about.  Everybody have fun tonight.  Everybody have fun tonight.  Everybody wang chong tonight.  Everybody wang chong. 
[02:57:30]  Bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling.  All I hear is radio glue glue.  I'm on a Mexican radio.  I'm on a Mexican whoa, whoa radio.  Bling, bling, bling, bling, bling.  I want to be your sledgehammer.  Why don't you call my name? 
[02:58:00]  Walk like an Egyptian.  Walk like an Egyptian.  Bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling.  99 loop balloon.  You know you're rock, Patrice.  Jesus. 
[02:58:30]  Nice.  Oh, shit.  From the far east of Long Island comes a new breed of hero.  This is Greg Opie Hughes.  A legend.  I'm a mess.  An uncommon warrior.  Na, na, na, na, na.  His skin is the color of converted rice.  That's right.  His blonde locks flow like morning sun through a wheat field.  Way to know your audience.  His shrouds are as dark as his tortured soul.  I'm a black ninja, fuck face. 
[02:59:00]  In a race against time, the black ninja challenges his deadliest foe.  An old cobra back.  He's in a mansion and he has a bunch of get-ups fighting for his love.  Training daily in his minimalist Upper East Side dojo.  I just whack it and whack it and whack it.  Accompanied by a mayonnaise slurping apprentice.  A boy trapped inside the body of a man.  What's wrong, Eric?  My cross is burning so bad.  Ew, ew.  On a mission to find the thief who stole the XM unit out of his car. 
[02:59:30]  Holy shit.  Now I'm mad.  A fearless warrior who refuses to back down.  We're all fucked.  A master of disguise blending into his surroundings.  Say, anybody seen that ninja?  Right here, you asshole!  No one can escape the wrath of the black ninja.  Coming soon to a dojo in Jersey.  Jersey?  I live in Jersey.  I'm a goddamn black ninja.  Bring it on.  Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na. 
[03:00:00]  Church-o-i!  Alright.  Bring it.  Bring it on.  Bring it.  What?  We hate all motherfuckers in June.  Oh, this rocks. 
[03:00:30]  This rocks.  Anthony and Yonkers.  Hey, what's up, Bill?  Hey, Anthony.  Listen, my brother's retarded.  If you like, I'll bring him down.  He can pick your scores for you.  How old is he?  He's 33.  33?  33?  I don't mean to laugh, sorry.  What type of mental retardation does he have, sir?  He doesn't look it, but he was down there before, but he has a mind of like a 13-year-old.  He doesn't know how to read.  Wait, he was...  But he's the rain man of wrestling.  He was down here before?  Yeah.  You allowed him to come see The Rock when he had the whole debacle and he got mad at you guys? 
[03:01:00]  No idea.  What?  Back in the day.  He was down there.  We were down...  Remember that day when Rock was down there and he stormed that on you?  Yeah.  Yeah, he was down there that day?  Yes, he was.  All right, well, bring him by for the football picks on Friday.  Yeah, bring him in.  Okay.  Show and tell.  Bring in your retard.  Oh, you fucking bastard.  I pick Willard-Delfia.  All right.  Thank you, Anthony.  Willard-Delfia.  I pick Wainsaw City.  You make fun, but he can't do any worse than you did. 
[03:01:30]  One for five.  One for five, motherfucker.  I got $10,000 and I got to win.  One for five.  One for five.  Goddamn retarded.  Yeah, you really...  One for five.  Fuck that up.  I'm going to put it.  Ah, fuck off.  I tried.  You beat me.  Shit.  I'm going to just be retarded picking.  Let me pick it for you again.  There was no research put into that.  You just went, I think that's good.  Circled it.  The Wets.  What?  The Wyans.  The Wyans.  The Glyans. 
[03:02:00]  I think the Knicks are going to win.  You want to look at some country sauce?  Yeah.  That's what I want to do.  Now, don't mention number one or two or three.  We got to count down.  It's very exciting to the radio audience when they're not sure which one number one is.  So we count them down.  We also play a little game here with country music.  We don't know country music at all.  We have a lot of people listening that enjoy country music and listen to it.  Because we are nationwide and Canadian and all over the world, this fucking show. 
[03:02:30]  Because it's such an important program.  And we don't know what the country songs are all about.  So we take the top ten country songs and we look at the title.  And then we try to guess through our stereotype we have of country music what the song could possibly be about.  And then we play a little of the song and see who is correct.  That's our little game.  It serves two purposes.  It shows how stupid we are as far as country music goes. 
[03:03:00]  And it gives the people that care the actual countdown of the top ten country songs.  And it shows how stupid country music is.  Exactly.  So the top ten country songs in America starting with number ten.  It's the band Rascal Flats.  Rascal Flats.  And a song called My Wish.  My Wish.  All right.  I'm going to just say this is exactly what it is.  My Wish.  It's the band's kind of telling what they wish the world was like instead of what it really is like. 
[03:03:30]  Absolutely.  Fucking absolutely no.  Okay.  My Wish.  Patrice never agrees.  But let me tell you.  Last time Patrice knocked these out of the ballpark.  I'm going to challenge Patrice today though.  My Wish is some pussy motherfucker who wants his dumb relationship to get better.  And he's been fucking up.  And he wishes you can forgive me for all the shit I did.  So my wish is that you love and then you love and then we can love again. 
[03:04:00]  My Wish.  My Wish.  Almost like a song Penny would write.  Bling, bling, bling, bling, bling.  My Wish.  My Wish.  Do Too Shy, please.  That made us all laugh.  You're too shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy.  Bling, bling, bling, ya'll too.  Shaw, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy, shy.  No, My Wish.  Someone is dying in this song.  All right.  Oh! 
[03:04:30]  Someone's dying.  Holy shit, I didn't even think of that one.  Man, there's going to be a daughter left behind.  No.  That needs a little Moment.  I Will Wish.  This group is new.  They're not touching on that.  That is old school.  Good strategy.  Jeff is old school.  That's for an old school guy that don't give a fuck.  These guys are like, this is an upbeat.  You think it's upbeat?  Upbeat.  Upbeat, but how could it be upbeat if he wants his chick back?  That's what they fucking do  It's like they sing the reverse blues  Like they can sing  Happy shit  But it'd be miserable  I think it's something about world 
[03:05:00]  The way the world is  It's gonna be slow  No fucking way  Country people sing about the world  They don't know about the world  There's death  They were at the sing concert  They wish he never played that fucking lute again  And that there's world peace  I say world peace  World peace  There's no fucking way  It's just  They don't know what  These Kentucky boobs  We don't know about the world  I like this  I like when we all have different ideas  Death and a kid involved  Death  Oh fucking dying kid  Not the kid dying  Death and a kid would be good though  And a kid's gonna be left behind 
[03:05:30]  You know  If it is death  I think you're right  I think death and a kid  But I don't think it is  Death and a fucking kid  And a kid's gonna be left behind  With dead parents  What are the odds?  It's not death  It's absolutely not death  What are the odds?  You're saying relationship  What are the odds  That the song's about  Poop shoot sex  My wish  My wish  That could be  Or maybe  A girlfriend  For your relationship  Right  My wish  As written by Patrice O'Neal  My wish  My wish is that  I can go knuckle deep  Lyrics and idea 
[03:06:00]  By Patrice O'Neal  My wish  That you'll see it my way  And I can bring a girlfriend  Into the relationship  Alright  Rascal Flatts  Coming in at number 10  Rascal Flatts  My wish  Let's see  Slow  A little plodding  So I'm gonna say  And I wish  She wasn't my sister  Like from Kentucky  It's slow  I'm not sure  If I call that slow 
[03:06:30]  This is slow  I hope the days  I hope the days come easy  And the moments pass slow  And each road leads you  Where you wanna go  And if you're faced with a choice  And you have to choose  I hope you choose the one  That means the most to you  And if one door opens  To another door closed  I hope you keep on walking  Till you find the window  If it's cold outside  Show the world  The warmth of your smile  Oh shit  But more than anything 
[03:07:00]  More than anything  Uh oh  Here we go  My wish  For you  Is that this life  Because  All that you want  Until your dreams  Stay big  Your worries stay small  You never need to carry  More than you can hold  And while you're out there  Getting where you're getting to  I hope you know  Somebody loves you  Yeah  Patrice is the closest here 
[03:07:30]  I am the closest to this  Patrice is the closest  Say what  It's not so much about  Nothing about cancer  It's not so much about  Him wanting to hook up  With this chick  Again  Or a break  Or even a break  It's some chick  He's in love with  And just wishes the best for her  So Patrice  I think is closest  Is it a daughter though  It's not about a kid  It could be either  With these motherfucking hicks  Daughter and lover  I see someone tapping his foot  In the other room by the way  Who  Bring in Steve  Oh Steve  You fucking 
[03:08:00]  Faggot  Steve  Remember when we first did this  Steve likes  Yeah Steve likes this shit  When he's on his treadmill  This is on his iPod  For three hours  When he runs on that treadmill  It's a treadmill Steve  You can't run away  From anything on it  When he's popping  Those pills  But it doesn't  Keep trying  You're always in the same place  You're not going anywhere  You're not running away  From old Steve  Or those horrid ideas  In your head  They're right here  I know  I keep trying  Faster  Beep  Beep  Beep

[03:10:00]  I can tell you  That's a little bit of Opie then  That's all Opie then  Yeah but I didn't have death  No  No  He based his whole thing on death  I wish you don't die  Because that's more of a world view  In fact  In fact when I saw them live  The guy actually brings up  Brought up a five year old  Little girl from the audience  And sang the song to her  His wife?  Aw  Maybe he's a pedophile girl  So did it was me  Fucking John Carr brought her  Alright  I'm going there  My wish 
[03:10:30]  That's great  It is kind of a combination of things  He is wishing the best for the world  But he's wishing it because  Well  For someone  My wish is that this isn't illegal  So  Let me tell you something  I think  I think we all kind of hit a piece of this one  Fucking  My wish is that  This is not illegal  Where the fuck did the soup go?

[03:11:30]  I said mine was that  He wishes the world would be a better place  Which is really  Which is kind of what it is  But it's based on the fact  That he says for  His child  He's just wishing the best for his daughter  Oh god  I wish  I don't have to even give a shit about this  Anybody  Fuck it  We all win  I'd say we all lose on that  Next  Number 9  No one was close enough  I don't think  Oh goody  What's that one?

[03:17:00]  We could think it through  But I don't want to  If you don't want to  We could keep things just the same  Leave here the way we came  With nothing to lose  But I don't want to  If you don't want to  Uh platonic relationship  No she's a whore who needs guidance buddy  Jesus Christ  It's a rape fantasy  It's like  Rape fantasy  Listen to me

[03:18:00]  If they do it  They might ruin the friendship  That they have  But if you want to  Go ahead  What the fuck  He's  He  Rape fantasy  Jesus Christ  I'm not with Patrice  She wants to fuck badly  But she doesn't want to  Look at it as a whore  So she's waiting for him  To make the move  I don't think so  He's not making the move  So she's like  Alright if you don't want to  I don't want to  But she wants to  She wants to  Right in the poop chute  I'm thinking more  Calm down version of that  Right in her sugar land  They've been out  They're fun  They've been having fun  They've been going out  It's not like  She's a fucking rapist  She just landed 
[03:18:30]  She just told you  They took her daddy's boat  This ain't no normal shit  They've been going out  For a while though  It's a cocktease song  Yeah yeah yeah  She  On his part  She wants it  Cause he's a fact  Because he's  He's a faggot  Nigga  Come on  Maybe he's a faggot  I can't  She wants to take this  To the next level  It could be a lot of things  I don't think it's a rape fantasy  She's like  And I think you need to  But she said  If you don't want to  Then she don't want to  And everything can stay 
[03:19:00]  She wants to know  No  We all know  But she doesn't want to be  Looked at as the talent  He said everything  She goes if he don't want to  She don't want to  Just to keep it the same  Will be cool too  Yeah she also said  We have a relationship  But it's not cool though  But it is  She says it in the fucking song  But the reason I said  Oh these country assholes  The reason I said rape fantasy  Is not to be rape  Rape fantasy is just  Exhume a woman from  Responsibility of  Right  Of fucking  Alright listen  She wants to fuck  This woman is fine  With the platonic relationship 
[03:19:30]  Or if it goes further  Either suits this bitch fine  But it's up to him  No  He's holding her  And he's rubbing the top of her head  And her pussy's wet  And he keeps thinking  He has to rub the top of her head  And she wants him to push her head down  Nigga make me do something  You faggot  That's what she's saying  You know  I think it's the fucking Scott Peterson  At the Modesto fucking marina  Hold on  With the boat  I just gotta peek at the chorus  This might  Help us all along here  Go ahead Derek  See 
[03:20:00]  She don't want to  If you don't want her  She wants 
[03:20:30]  She wants  To do anything  This fucking sissy wants to  Yeah but if you don't want  To do anything  That's fine with her too  What guy  Doesn't  She's like  Apparently this motherfucking  Faggot  Because he hasn't done it  For fucking years  The guy's been taking her out  And fucking  In picnic baskets  And boats  And they haven't done shit  And she's like  You want to  And he goes  No  And she goes  I don't want to  I don't either  You fucking  Sissy  She wants  Cog  This is a girl  Fucking song  You guys are thinking 
[03:21:00]  Guy  Yeah  This is a girl song  She's thinking  Friends are fine  If we're just friends  And you want to  Keep it that way  Fine but if we start  Kissing  Everything's gonna change  Think about how women  Run the world right now  Think about how they  Run shit right now  You guys  So wrong on this  And the strength of women  They can say  Look  Pussy  Come on man  You guys got this  So fucking wrong  I don't want to say  It's about high school kids  And they had that  Like flirtatious  Like high school relationship  And then  Someone opened fire  In the school then  Please  But now she wants to fuck 
[03:21:30]  She wants to  It ain't about her fucking  It's a woman  Singing the fucking song  Here's more of the lyrics  I got your ring around my neck  In a couple of nights  I don't regret  You got a dream of a degree  And a shirt that smells like me  Yeah we both got dreams  We should chase alone  Or we can make our own  She wants a relationship  She wants a relationship  She wants to fuck  She wants this motherfucker  She wants threesome  She wants  Deep inside her sugar land twat  That's right man  You guys  And she wants someone  You are reading this 
[03:22:00]  So fucking wrong  She wants to go  You've infected  Everybody's thinking  With your  Yeah  She wants to go  You're fucking  You're absolutely sick  In the head  You're rape  He's got Patricianitis man  Yes  I'm telling you  Patricianomics  I took her down to Opie  I saw it  He got his own brain  I see it  And he  She hears it  You don't hear that  Nice shit  She's not saying  This is not about  Fucking anything  She wants  She knows she is  Okay ready  We'll back it up  From  She wants more  That's right 
[03:22:30]  Or not  There's not  She's fucking trying  Holy fuck  Where do you get this  Where she's so adamant  About fucking  And doing everything  Because she's  Because a woman  I want to  If you do  But it's not  Women cannot just  Control the shit like that  She doesn't want  A guy  That she has to tell  To fucking make a move  She's like  Come on  You fucking  I'm right here  My legs are open  Let's go  They have a fine relationship  Get into this redneck hole  They have a fine relationship  The way it is 
[03:23:00]  But it's not  Like  Love  It's not fine  And she's saying  That if we do  Take that extra step  That other relationship  Is gone  There's no going back  Well yeah  She's scared a little bit  But  But it has nothing  To do with  Fucking double penetration  And fucking  Joking on this guy's cum  Jesus Christ  Holy shit  Wow  We have to  We have to agree  To disagree  Shut up  Dude she doesn't want 
[03:23:30]  To be known as a slut  So she can't make  The first move  The women can make  The first move  In general  Especially in country songs  Only on number nine  Who would say  If I want to  If you want to  If I want to  Who even says that  A girl  It's a girl song  You fucking idiot  What is she giving  She's giving him  A little bit of confidence  It's like  Hey can I come  In your face  Can I come  In your face  Hey look  If you want to  She's explaining yeah  I would  I would  Have a relationship  With you or not  Can I come  In your face  Let's move on  If you want to 
[03:24:00]  If you want  You can do  Spider-Man  You can do  Spider-Man  If you want to  If you want to  Well again  We got to agree  To disagree  Alright  She really puts  The cunt in country  By the way  Mike from Denver  One of the last phrases  In the song  We didn't get to the end  Is but I want to  Thank you  Thank you  That's  But I want to  I want you  There is  The last  But I want to  But I want you  That's how the song ends  She wants  That's how the song ends  She wants some  That's her opinion of it 
[03:24:30]  She wants a man  I have to say  I have to say  The last line  Shed a lot of light  I think  She wants some  Granite  I don't think she wants  Double penetration  But maybe you know  I think she'd still be fine  If he said  She wants to  But  Everyone's  Well not everyone  She's going through the whole song  Saying if you don't want to  I don't want to  But who had that  No one saw that anyway  I forgot what anyone guessed now  After this heated debate  I know I was very wrong  You were very wrong  I was very wrong  Patrice is so far off  Into another galaxy 
[03:25:00]  No way man  I see it Patrice's way  This time around  Thank you man  Alright  Well we'll have to  Just let that one sit  The next one is  Brooks and Dunn  With Sheryl Crow  And Vince Gill  This is too easy  Building bridges  Building bridges  Come on  That's too easy  That's too easy  What is it  Big bridge  So a big park  Can be trucked  Into our pussy  Or some shit  An 18 wheel  Into Sheryl Crow's pussy  A dildo

[03:26:00]  Happy  With this line up  You could be right  Liberal ass  Everyone loves each other  Exactly  And we're wrong  A little bit of  We're wrong thrown in there  We gotta build more bridges  Instead of  We understand  And we're white  So we gotta be wrong  Yeah  I understand whitey  Sorry for what  I did in my people zoo  Building bridges  Oh yeah  And you two Indians  Well my granddaddy  Whipped your grandpappy  For that I'm sorry  We gotta build bridges 
[03:26:30]  Unless they're building bridges  Back to Africa  Because that  Sounds more like  A country song to me  We'll make the walk  A little easier  And the chorus  Is them just going  Damn this is a big bridge  Lucky Slide Smith  From Quorum  Ah dude  Just change the channel  Then I don't know  What to tell you  He writes  You guys are killing me  With this shit  Get this hillbilly shit  Just updated

[03:49:00]  I took a Louisville  Slugger  To both headlines  And slashed a home  And all four tires  Maybe next time  I'll pay for you  What a lunatic  Wow  She beat the shit  Out of his fucking truck  And maybe he'll think  Twice before he cheats  Oh  This guy ain't thinking  I thought she was leaving  He's cheating  And he don't give a shit  What you do to his shit  I had part one  Now why would he  Bring this chick home  And introduce him  Why doesn't
