<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, centered around the three-year anniversary of the "Sex for Sam" incident, began with a retrospective on the event and its media fallout.  The hosts revisited the arrest of Brian Florence, Loretta Harper, and producer Paul Mercurio following their participation in a contest to have sex in public places, culminating in an incident at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  They played news reports and the audio of the call with Mercurio at the Cathedral, highlighting the discrepancies between sensationalized media coverage and the actual event.  Listener calls contributed to the discussion, along with a mention of a fan-funded billboard.  The hosts’ firing from WNEW and subsequent move to satellite radio were discussed, interspersed with criticism of media personalities like Julia Barber who covered the story.  A Jack Black song containing offensive language was played.

The show continued its focus on the "Sex for Sam" aftermath, featuring a live phone call with Paul, who recounted his attempts to get arrested as well.  The hosts reflected on their firing and the hypocrisy of other radio personalities, particularly Mancow Muller, whose criticisms were contrasted with his own past controversial stunts.  Audio clips of Sean Hannity and Mancow commenting on the incident were played.  Other topics included listener calls, the use of a "balloon knot" euphemism, recent box office results, and a discussion on judicial inconsistencies using examples like Russell Crowe's large payout for a minor injury versus a smaller payout for a woman wrongly diagnosed with breast cancer.  Planned guests Cal Ripken Jr., Tony Raimondo, and psychic Chris Fleming (whose appearance was cancelled) were mentioned.

A significant portion of the broadcast was dedicated to criticizing Howard Stern for his perceived unfair disparagement following their firing and to discussing  Clear Channel's offer and Infinity Broadcasting's counter-offer that ultimately led to their departure.  The hosts recounted anecdotes about Stern's complaints about others “cloning” his show.  They also discussed Mancow Muller’s hypocrisy, playing several audio clips to highlight inconsistencies in his statements. The story of the listener’s participation in the St. Patrick's Cathedral incident was revisited, with increasingly absurd speculative scenarios and a call from Nick the Brit confirming the story's international reach.  The hosts spent considerable time discussing "pervertedjustice.com," finding humor in its methods and highlighting a case involving a SiriusXM hat; future segments featuring readings from the website were planned.  A caller, Chris from Minnesota, explained semaphore flags. Nick the Brit was a guest in studio.

The show included a segment mocking stereotypical female contributions to male-dominated radio, followed by a discussion with in-studio guest Tony Raimondo, editor of *Sync* magazine.  They discussed a giveaway promotion featuring free items and a segment analyzing used hard drives, revealing private information of previous owners.  This transitioned to further discussion of Perverted Justice and a sex toy with a USB connection.  Cal Ripken Jr. called in for an interview covering his post-baseball career, youth baseball initiatives, his radio show, his record-breaking consecutive game streak (including security concerns), and a humorous debunking of a Kevin Costner urban legend.  The interview concluded with plugs for Ripken's baseball camp and radio show. The segment ended with a highly profane and offensive clip of Earl Weaver.

The final segment began with a discussion of radio personality Bob Edwards, followed by a story about a man who falsely claimed to be an Oompa Loompa from the 1971 *Willy Wonka* film.  The man's admission and motivation were discussed, along with the fates of the original Oompa Loompas. The segment concluded with vulgar jokes and offensive comments regarding the Oompa Loompa impersonator.  Brief mention was again made of *Sync* magazine.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Remember yesterday we were talking about those two morons on the radio station WNEW?  They had this contest where they encouraged people to have sex in public places.  Well, they're toast. It's over.  They apparently went way over the line when they encouraged a couple to have sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral  and then broadcast these activities on their program. 
[00:00:30]  Opie and Anthony, out of here.  The couple has been charged with obscenity and public lewdness.  They're due back in court in October, having sex in the church  while worshippers observe the Feast of the Assumption.  What a tasteful experience this whole thing was.  The radio show offered a prize for listeners to have sex in public places.  When public outrage reached the boss's desk, the head of Viacom dropped the axe on the show.  And the postscript is the Catholic League says the punishment fits the crime  and it will now drop its complaint with the Federal Communications Commission. 
[00:01:00]  Much, I'm sure, to the relief of the people who own the WNEW radio.  How many of you are here for the open tennis in Queens?  How many of you are here for...  Okay.  How many of you are here for the open sex at St. Patrick's Cathedral?  How many of you are here for the open sex at St. Patrick's Cathedral?  How many of you are here for the open sex at St. Patrick's Cathedral?  How many of you are here for the open sex at St. Patrick's Cathedral?  All right, that's fine.  I'm out.  What?  Hey!  Don't ask if you don't want to hear the tough answers. 
[00:01:30]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Yes.  That's right, kiddies.  Happy anniversary.  Three years ago today, we ruined our careers.  Right.  We would never work again.  Yeah, we're going to go down memory lane a little bit today.  Three years?  Three years ago today, yeah.  Jesus.  Three years ago today, we did our Sex for Sam thing and got fired! 
[00:02:00]  Wow.  And then had to take two years and three months off.  Can't believe that was three years.  Three years ago, man.  Jesus.  It's kind of fun to look back a little bit because everyone said that we wouldn't work again.  Well, it's fun now that we're working.  Of course.  It wasn't fun for a couple of years when we weren't working to listen to that.  Wasn't that a bittersweet thing like that Letterman?  All of a sudden, you're getting some type of recognition and people are acknowledging it like Letterman. 
[00:02:30]  But you're fired.  It's kind of like, all right, we're getting some press on that one.  We sure are.  But what good will it do?  None.  Yeah, well, that stunk.  That whole two-year period stunk.  Here's another one.  Which one was this?  Hardball.  Most people come to St. Patrick's Cathedral to pray.  But last week, one couple allegedly came to the New York City landmark to have sex. 
[00:03:00]  Brian Florence and Loretta Harper were arrested for public lewdness after their carnal communion, a few feet from worshipers, was described live on the radio.  Shock jock's Opie and Anthony had encouraged the couple to have sex at locations where a producer was waiting to call in the play-by-play.  The radio team, part of Infinity Broadcasting, is off the air, and their managers have been suspended.  But religious organizations are demanding the station's license be revoked.  This is outrageous.  Not only does it involve obscenity in the most extreme form, people having sex at 4 o'clock in the afternoon at St. Patrick's Cathedral on a holy day, but the nerve of these people to actually have it as a setup. 
[00:03:30]  For its part, the station says, WNEW regrets the unfortunate incident that took place.  We apologize to anyone who has been offended and have taken measures to ensure that it does not happen again.  All right, maybe playing these clips isn't fun after all.  Yeah.  That was Ken Stevens' quote, that awful, we're sorry if anyone was offended.  Yeah.  I don't even know if that was Ken Stevens. 
[00:04:00]  I don't know who that was.  I think they even told him to shut his trap.  I think that came from way, way, way up.  From the backpedaling jerk-offs.  Oh, we apologize.  Everything should be hunky-dory now.  No, it shouldn't.  No.  We're fired.  Here's another one.  The radio station that fired shock jocks Opie and Anthony is still under investigation.  The Federal Communications Commission says it's being flooded with complaints regarding WNEW-FM.  The station broadcast a couple allegedly having sex inside St. Patrick's Cathedral, 
[00:04:30]  and now the FCC is looking into whether to strip the station of its broadcast license.  But experts say never before has the station lost its license based on an indecency complaint.  Right now, WNEW is filling the slot once filled by Opie and Anthony seen here with a nationally syndicated talk show.  Meanwhile, the couple involved in the alleged sex stunt is facing charges of public lewdness and obscenity. 
[00:05:00]  It should have done NEW a favor and pulled the license.  It'd probably have more listeners than it does now without a license.  Yeah, that's one thing.  The radio station we did this on has never, never come back.  It just crashed and burned, and that's it.  It does not come back.  It's still suffering three years later.  Ratings in the toilet.  It still has no audience.  Good move.  Absolutely no audience whatsoever.  They're doing, like, classic hip-hop dance, Puerto Rican style, if you're a black person living in a white neighborhood. 
[00:05:30]  That's their format.  Enjoy.  Enjoy it.  The guys, oh, they're such good guys.  They only ask people to have sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Well, you know.  Everybody can make a mistake.  Priests are doing it.  Why not?  That's what I say.  I'd make the hetero joke, but I will not.  Anyway, you know, those are the guys who had a little contest on their show.  They wanted people to have sex in surprising places.  And St. Patrick's, I found that rather a surprising place to have sex. 
[00:06:00]  They also had their listeners.  Yes.  Somebody wrote this copy and I didn't change it.  Do it.  Okay, let's not put it that way.  Do it.  Ask their listeners to have relations in a Disney store.  Oh, now, see, that's out of line.  That bothers me.  Yeah, that bothers me more than the church.  That is blank and goofy.  There's stuff.  That is blank and goofy.  And in the Cinderella section.  Oh.  That's just wrong.  Okay, you know what?  Actually, I've changed my opinion.  I don't believe these guys.  Do you know why that is almost more disgusting than St. Patrick's? 
[00:06:30]  Not more disgusting than God's house, but close because there are so many kids around.  Yeah, exactly.  And these guys love that idea because they also had a couple do it, as we say, in FAO Schwartz, in Tiffany's.  Tiffany's I can live with, but a kid's store.  Carnegie Hall.  That's just not, you know, I just, you know, I have a little kid that's not cool.  Yeah.  That's not cool.  If I was in Toys R Us last night and had it been going on, there'd have been trouble.  Someone would have choked on a Winnie the Pooh doll because I had taken them out.  Not around Mike.  They also had their listeners have sex at the Hard Rock Cafe, which I didn't actually find 
[00:07:00]  that surprising, and McDonald's.  So just a little mixed sex.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  This is the fucking, the worst dialogue I've ever heard in my life.  It's horrendous.  It's a national TV show.  What show is that?  This is Fox Good Day.  Oh, Fox Good Day.  It's local, I guess.  Oh.  Oh, is that?  This is a local news show here in New York City.  That is atrocious.  There would have been trouble.  Yeah, someone would have choked on a Pooh doll.  They try to portray it like they were children in plain view of people having sex. 
[00:07:30]  weren't they in closets and, like, elevator mechanical rooms, things like that, that were  in FAO Schwartz?  It wasn't like they were standing on top of kids' toys with children watching, having sex.  It was in, like, little nooks and crannies in closets of some of these places.  It wasn't like they made an announcement and made sure all the kids gathered.  Gather around, children.  We're going to show you something that you usually don't see at FAO Schwartz.  Ho, ho, ho, ho.  God, they tried so hard to make it something it wasn't, you know? 
[00:08:00]  Tried so hard to boost this up because the story, the reality of it wouldn't have been  that titillating, exciting, dangerous.  The reality is, yeah, they went into places like FAO Schwartz and the Disney store, but  they were inside rooms, in closets, dressing rooms, things like that.  No kid is going to see them having sex in.  Ridiculous.  Just like the church, just like the church.  It wasn't in front of people that were there to pray. 
[00:08:30]  They were in a vestibule.  There was no one around.  Like, the security guard was around.  He came running into the scene, but that was it.  But they liked to pump it up and make it seem like it was more than it was.  McDonald's.  So just a little make-sex.  How do you have sex at a McDonald's?  My God.  I don't know.  I worked at Burger King.  There are a lot of little crevices you can get yourself into.  Now, some poly-esque uniform near the grease fryer is always a very thing.  You just melt to it and you stick. 
[00:09:00]  That's right.  You can take your shirt off.  And if you want to hear the tape, I don't know why you would, but if you want to, if you're  missing Opie and Anthony, I've screwed up so many times I can't say it right now, you  can actually hear the tape of the couple having sex at St. Patrick's on the internet.  No, you can't, you assholes.  You actually can't.  Again.  Again, wrong.  That's, I think.  Can we get the fucking phone call?  I don't think we've ever re-eared it.  Here's the, yeah, let's get it.  I don't know if I have it yet. 
[00:09:30]  We'll have it in a few minutes.  We've got to show people because they, they talked about this like it was live sex being  broadcast over our airwaves that day.  That's how they described it.  Look, and you could download it off the internet and hear the couple having sex at St. Patrick's  No, you can't because that, it didn't happen.  There was no audio.  It just, what actually got broadcast was nothing.  It was probably the tamest thing we've ever had on the air. 
[00:10:00]  And I'm, I mean, with any dialogue of us talking about anything, there was nothing  there, but it didn't make a good story.  All right.  We're waiting for that audio.  Hopefully we'll have it soon.  Who's that?  Who's the broad?  Who's this broad?  Who is that broad?  I don't know.  I don't think she does TV anymore.  They're just terrible.  Just completely uncompelling and uninteresting.  We handed them one of the best stories, one of the best New York stories in recent memory.  Well, except for the biggie, obviously.  And they, they had nothing. 
[00:10:30]  They had nothing.  Yeah.  Having sex at St. Patrick's on the internet.  And some people think that it's not real, that they really weren't.  But when you listen to the tape, I think it's fairly clear that they were.  The woman was found without any bottoms on.  And the security guard walks up and the security guard is like, what is going on here?  And the guy from their radio show is saying to him, it's okay, leave them alone.  It's their right.  Wow.  You know, I think, uh, my opinion about this is that you don't need to be dirty to be fucked.  You can't.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[00:11:00]  I don't know.  I'm just dead serious.  You can come up with another bit than that.  That's all you had?  That's it.  Hey, people.  Hey.  Because that's all we did on the radio four hours a day, five days a week.  You don't need to be dirty to be funny.  It was just having, uh, couples have sex all over the place.  That's all we did, you fucking asshole.  And he never, no one ever said it was their right to have sex.  She's just blurting out bullshit.  Right.  Just blatant bullshit coming out of that mouth.  And it turned out the security guard that found the couple that day had a very shady past. 
[00:11:30]  He was, uh.  Oh, he got thrown out of St. Pat's.  He got fired.  Not many people know that.  He made a horrendous witness.  He was stealing from the poor boss.  That's what I heard, supposedly, yeah.  He was stealing from the poor boss.  That's what the papers reported, when he got fired.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, so he got fired.  They would have kept you on the air.  Do you understand how fucking fast that would have been to play up?  This is the guy who, this is your witness?  Yeah.  Stop.  Boy, did they screw up by yanking you guys.  Chick name is Julia Barber.  Oh, Julia Barber?  Kenny!  Yeah.  You're talking about, that was Julia Barber from L.A.? 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, she was on that show, Good Morning, or whatever, or whatever.  Okay, I think her L.A. show was canceled.  They were trying to bring her to New York.  I know who she is.  Yeah.  And what she wanted to talk, she's talking about having sex on that extreme dating show  at night.  Oh, really?  Well, she was also the one they tried to team up with Regis before they found Kelly.  Oh, really?  Yeah, Regis couldn't handle her energy.  Her energy is, like, completely ridiculous.  All right.  Well, she, yeah, she's had a pretty much failed TV career, so. 
[00:12:30]  Yes.  All right, thank you, Kenny.  What, does she have, like, a high energy?  She's, like, really peppy.  Really high energy.  She's an older lady trying to still look hot and sexy through the TV.  She's awful.  Absolutely awful.  Here's another one.  Another sex scandal in the Catholic Church tonight, but this one involves a radio stunt.  Three people are under arrest for having sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral while radio fans  listened in.  Why would anyone want to do this? 
[00:13:00]  Well, Alita Lopez is live right now at St. Pat's to explain.  Why would anyone want to do this?  Let's do this.  Why?  Can't wait for the answer.  Here it comes.  Kylie, Opie and Anthony, the duo from 102.7 WNEW, has long been known for their antics, most  recently for having a voyeur bus filled with barely clad women cruise around Times Square.  Now, that got a lot of press from City Hall, but tonight's sex in public places stunt that  got all the way here to this holy place may have gone too far. 
[00:13:30]  Now, police say 37-year-old Brian Florence and 35-year-old Loretta Lynn Harper, both of  Virginia, were arrested for having sex on a vestibule outside St. Patrick's Cathedral  during the live Opie and Anthony show this afternoon around 4.45.  A security guard discovered the pair and 42-year-old Paul Mercurio of New York City, who was working  with the station and apparently was on a cell phone relaying the act on air.  Tonight, the trio are at Midtown North Precinct, and the couple is charged with obscenity in the 
[00:14:00]  third degree, Paul Mercurio for acting in concert.  Now, the incident today was part of the radio show's Sex for Sam contest, seen here on this  website.  It challenged people to have sex in public places Thursday, August 15th, today, with  the spotter from the show tagging along.  Now, couples will accumulate points for where and who was involved in these acts.  The couple with the most points, the prize, was a trip to Boston.  Well, she described it accurately.  All right.  That's exactly right.  Absolutely right. 
[00:14:30]  She got all the facts.  It was Paul.  It wasn't someone from the show.  It was there.  That was a great description.  It wasn't in the actual church.  Very good.  The message was relayed from him over the air, not the couple.  You couldn't hear them.  Wow.  Perfect.  To Boston.  Now, again, tonight, the trio is in the Midtown North Precinct and is expected to be arraigned  tomorrow morning.  Now, police also tell us that Florence, the man from the couple caught in the act, was 
[00:15:00]  also taken to St. Clair's Hospital to get prescribed medication for, of all things, a back pain.  Now, no comment tonight from St. Patrick's Cathedral or the radio station.  We're live tonight at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  I'm Lolita Lopez for the WB11 News to 10.  Peter, back to you.  All right, Lolita.  The prize was a trip to Boston.  Go figure.  Oh, wow.  Hey, shut up.  What's that guy getting at?  Go figure.  WB11, the only one that got it right so far.  Yeah.  Well, that's just the tip of the iceberg. 
[00:15:30]  I mean, there were so many news reports and commentary and, you know.  Oh, it just went on and on.  People just discussing our lives.  Whether we should work, whether we will work again.  We're done in the business.  I like those guys.  We've gotten those after each of our firings.  The guys that get on and just say, well, it's over for them.  That's it.  You'll never see them again.  They're done.  And they're going to have to find another career.  They're done.  Oh, well, we're back. 
[00:16:00]  We're back again.  We come back.  Satellite radio spreading the virus once again.  Slowly but surely rebuilding our radio career.  It's getting more gooder every day.  More gooder.  Remember we thought we might be arrested?  That night the phone was still, Billy Mac was still going, look, they might arrest you guys.  They might not.  And, of course, Ben was fueling all that with his pen.  Ben was, you know, it was like, you know, don't do it.  They might come out and arrest everybody.  He had no facts at all.  Don't, don't.  I'm going to bet horrifying everyone on that little phone. 
[00:16:30]  It is a little phone.  Let's say hi to Jerry.  Jerry, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Pretty good, Jerry.  Good.  I wanted to remind, I guess, the new listeners or you guys that the guy was taken out, the guy who had sex in the church was taken out a couple of years or maybe a year ago, two years ago by a heart attack.  Yeah, the guy that was in that contest and arrested, he ended up dying of a heart attack.  That is a fact.  I can't remember his first name.  Brian. 
[00:17:00]  I don't really know the details, but I heard that he had a rough life in general.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Something tells me he wasn't going to the hospital for back medication.  I think it was like methadone or something.  I know some facts about that, but we'll just let it be.  But he ended up passing from a heart attack.  And boy, the city raked those two through the coals.  I mean, the way they handled the city, for over a year they dragged it out.  They really couldn't get them on much, so they just really made them come up from Virginia about eight, ten times.  They just wanted to make their lives a living hell because they had nothing on the couple. 
[00:17:30]  They were found innocent for the most part, right?  They had a little community service, but they were found innocent of the major charges.  And, yeah, the fact is they knew that, so they were like, well, let's just make them come up here for a year back and forth, you know, taking time off from work and everything else.  That girl's name was Jillian Barbary was her name.  Yeah.  The guy was saying Julia Barber or something.  I knew what he was talking about.  Thanks, Jerry.  She's a little dirty girl. 
[00:18:00]  Why?  Looking at pictures of her, she's in, like, bra and panties, bikinis.  Yeah, she tries to.  She's got, like, a huge camel toe.  No.  Yeah, look.  She tries to dress really sexy.  Look at her.  Oh, she doesn't look like that anymore, bro.  Look at her huge camel toe there, Jimmy.  You like that?  Yeah, she doesn't look like that anymore.  No, because there's plenty of pictures of her up there.  She's nice.  See?  She's definitely hot.  Looks like she has Leno's chin in her panties.  Because it wasn't, like, a split toe. 
[00:18:30]  It was, like, one of those just big fat ones, which could be, like, you know, just big meat or it could be a toboggan.  Whatever it is.  I want to go.  Meaty.  We're waiting for that audio.  I hope Eric has it soon.  He's going to have it in a minute.  All right.  Let's go to Chucky from whackbag.com.  Chucky, what's going on?  We should have the billboard up this afternoon in O-Town.  These guys are obsessed with O-Town.  What is the billboard going to say in O-Town?  This is what's so funny.  I guess I've got to tell the brand-new listeners. 
[00:19:00]  We're getting new listeners every day.  We're not getting much marketing these days.  We get a splash of marketing every once in a while.  XM will throw us a bone.  Well, our fans have taken it upon themselves, and they bought themselves a billboard.  Right, Chucky?  Right.  And you're putting it up in O-Town, Orlando.  Actually, it'll be in Maitland where the studio is.  Where the studio is?  Yes.  Yeah?  And what does it say? 
[00:19:30]  Mr. Phillips, the Pets win.  You lose.  Good day, sir.  The Opium Anti-Army commemorating the past battle of O-Town.  It's in school bus yell against black, and it's going up on a clear channel billboard.  Wow.  And you're down there just to make sure the billboard is put up right?  No, I'm not.  Oh, I thought you were down in O-Town.  No, I'm in Philadelphia and about to fly shortly to Atlanta.  No, I mean, the appreciation is huge for this little thing you did. 
[00:20:00]  And I think I saw what the billboard is going to look like, and there was something missing.  I hate to be picky, but is there any mention of where Opium Anthony can be heard?  No, there's not.  We weren't sure whether there are any legal issues on XM and 202, so we decided just to do attack with him.  We do want to check with Eric Logan on what they'd be.  The Pets are emailing you, Lola.  What they don't prosecute us on. 
[00:20:30]  Okay.  Because we know they have to protect their rights.  Lola loves your emails, by the way.  He does read them.  He reads all the emails from the Pests.  All right, sir.  That's pretty cool.  Thanks very much, man.  And wait until the other ones.  Oh, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Oh, thanks, man.  I appreciate that.  What do you mean, wait for the other ones?  How many did you guys buy?  Oh, just for other Pat Battles.  Oh, other plans.  We've got something special for Russ Martin.  Plans, and we've got other things planned down the road.  And how much does a billboard cost?  This one was $1,000. 
[00:21:00]  For how long?  One month.  Wow, that's not bad.  That's pretty cheap.  It's a small one.  And out of the way, most of them are about $3,000 to $4,000 a month.  That's all a bill.  I'm not saying that's all to minimalize.  I'm just saying when you're looking at a company, I thought it was a lot more than that.  That's not bad, man.  Thank you guys for doing that.  Yeah, and New York will be a lot more.  I wonder how much is for a month in New York.  You think probably $20,000?  Something like that.  We're checking on it.  It's got to be way up there.  So this billboard's going to be right outside the studios down there?  It's going to be about two miles away or three miles away. 
[00:21:30]  But we have been advised by the guys at Cleo Channel that he will definitely see it.  The sales rep seemed to pick this up after he knew what it was for it.  And they'll make sure that he knows who it is.  But he's likely to see it before they tell him.  All right.  Chucky, you guys rock.  Thank everyone at Wackbag that donated for our billboard.  Okay.  Let us know when the next fund is.  Maybe we'll be willing to throw some cash in. 
[00:22:00]  How great would that be?  Oh, the next fund is already collected for the next project.  We're waiting for a third one.  All right.  Let us know.  You guys have a fucking union going.  Pests.  I miss you, too.  Mayhem.  I love the pests.  They've taken it upon themselves to make this show big again.  All right, Chucky.  Thank you.  Thanks, man.  All right.  The pest thing is getting out of hand.  Where's the Starbucks thing?  We started talking about this, and then Howie Mandel came in on Friday and just kicked ass for our radio. 
[00:22:30]  He was great.  He was unbelievable on Friday.  Hopefully, you heard it or heard it during the replay, whatever.  Anyway, we were talking about the Starbucks machine.  Remember that?  Yeah.  We were talking about how I spend about $50 myself a week on Starbucks easily, and Jimmy's got to be even higher than that.  And it's got to be, even though you don't drink coffee, you like their apple cakes and this and that.  I love the apple cake.  You're probably doing an easy $20 a week, no problem.  Sure.  So between us three, we're probably over $100 a week spending on Starbucks and mentioning Starbucks on every single show. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Giving them free advertising.  And down in Washington, they got these great Starbucks coffee machines.  I'm like, we want one up here.  We've been asking for one for about four months now.  And, you know, we're not getting anywhere.  So one of the pests actually wrote Starbucks.  Yeah.  After hearing the many morning shows about coffee, Starbucks, Starbucks coffee machines, et cetera, I took it upon myself.  This is one of the pests writing this.  To send an email to Starbucks concerning the O&A show getting their own machine, I got this response today. 
[00:23:30]  Dear Mr. Shaw, thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts with us regarding your idea to give the Opie and Anthony show on XM channel 202 a barista machine.  I guess they're called barista machines?  Yeah.  Your feedback is essential to Starbucks' continued growth and progress.  Therefore, I documented your comments in order to inform our retail marketing department.  Should you have additional questions or concerns, please call our customer relations department at blah, blah, blah to speak with a representative or email us at. 
[00:24:00]  And I don't have the email address for some reason, but there you go.  What does that mean?  Is that an answer?  It's a form letter, basically.  That's nothing.  It's a form letter.  But at least the pests are trying to get us a Starbucks machine, right?  What does that mean?  When does the coffee flow?  I don't know.  When does the coffee start flowing?  In Washington, they got like five of those things.  They're great.  And we have enough people up here.  We need one. 
[00:24:30]  So the pests, you know.  At this point, we don't even have to tell the pests to do stuff.  No, they know.  They understand the show.  They understand what's going on.  They understand the battles we're facing.  And they take it upon themselves to email ELO, email Starbucks, get a fund together for a damn billboard down in Orlando just to rub it in a little bit.  Yeah.  I guess they got a billboard going up in Dallas in the near future.  They're amazing.  And I think they're working on something for New York.  You know, ELO writes these guys back, too.  ELO has, like, relationships with some of these people. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, I know.  Writes them back.  When do you see that happening?  He respects the pests.  You have to.  They might turn on you.  Barbary was in Playboy.  Barbary is a big Hollywood whore.  She is.  Rob in Boston.  What's up, Rob?  Hey, what's up, little Jimmy?  Hey, you know that Julian Barbary chick you guys were talking about?  Yeah.  I was like, she's telling you down the river.  Apparently, she's, like, fucked, like, everybody in Hollywood trying to, like, further her career and still has gotten nowhere. 
[00:25:30]  She's, like, a huge slut, like, at parties and shit.  She'll come up and, like, go leave with one guy, come back, and pick up some other, like, C, D, E-list star.  Nice.  And she's trying to sweep her way through Hollywood and still getting nowhere.  Really?  Exactly.  All right.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  And this guy, Ellis from Philly.  Ellis, what's up?  Hey, Jillian Barbary.  She was the weather girl on the Fox football shows on Sunday afternoons, and also, she was recently married to Ryan Seacrest. 
[00:26:00]  Speck and Zetak?  Oh, again.  Oh, again.  All right, Ellis.  Thank you.  I must have nailed him with that one a year ago.  Well, I'm in stall mode because we want to play the actual phone call.  The actual phone call.  But it's so filthy, right, that we have to edit it?  Is that why?  No.  No?  I figured it was so filthy with all the talk of sex.  Explicit sex. 
[00:26:30]  Hmm.  Well, it is the anniversary of the Sex for Sam thing.  Yeah.  And I actually had to come in here at six and tell everyone that we might want to play clips from this.  I had no idea that it was even the anniversary.  Hey, it's been documented.  I don't remember anniversaries very well.  I understand that.  That's a big day.  I mean, some of the radio message, radio board sites are basically saying our little stunt started changing radio, as everyone knows it.  You see this little blurb? 
[00:27:00]  What paper was this in?  Daily News.  Daily News.  Morning co-host Goomba Johnny of WKTU here in New York, noting the sex scandal with the St. Patrick's priest, joked that, quote,  he should be ashamed of himself.  He stole the idea from Opie and Anthony.  Very good.  Thank you, Goomba Johnny.  Goomba Johnny has always been like a friend of the show.  Yeah.  He's what you call a good egg.  Right.  Kind of strange, because he's doing a morning show as we do a morning show. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  How does that work?  I don't get that.  Let me get room.  Because he does like a very, he's kind of happy and fun on the air, and yet you know he'd be happy to break your thumbs with his teeth.  That fucking animal.  He really is.  He's a psychopath.  All right, I'm going to go into stall mode.  We've got a Jack Black song here I want to play for everybody.  Uh-huh.  I've got to warn all the ladies out there, this song pertains the C word.  Oh, Jesus.  This song pertains the C word.  Don't you have a warning or something for that, Ope?  The song pertains, yeah, where is that? 
[00:28:00]  Pertains?  Pertains?  Pertains?  Pertinence?  Well, um, what you're saying pertains to the song, but the song contains the C word.  I mean contains, contains, you're right.  It's a little, it's still early, though.  I know.  Contains.  Contains the C word, you're right.  Contains the C word.  Oh, there are several ways to irritate a lady.  You could mention that her act has gone out of style.  Oh, that's sure to get a myth.  It's bound to cause a tip. 
[00:28:30]  But here's a little trick to go the extra more.  Give her just a little kick in the cunt.  A kick in the cunt?  Ah, kick in the cunt.  That's about a nice kick in the cunt.  You'll sure have a stunt if you go for the punt with a jolly good kick in the cunt.  Now a lady of grace will show utter distaste for a slur or a randy suggestion. 
[00:29:00]  But if you call her a whore, it may do nothing more than make a subtle change in her complexion.  So give her a kick in the cunt.  A kick in the cunt?  Ah, kick in the cunt!  That's about a lovely kick in the cunt, eh?  If you ain't to annoy, there's no better ploy than a rousing good kick in the cunt. 
[00:29:30]  Now you might want a sucker or clopping the choppers.  A sucker for making a grab at a knockers.  But she'll hold the coppers and you'll in the jail where you eat bread and water and shit in the pail.  So if you've enough of a womanly guff, no need to be rough.  It'll be quite enough to call her bluff with a huff and a puff.  Just snuff your foot straight into the muff.  Just an old-fashioned kick in the cunt.  A kick in the cunt?  A kick in the cunt!  As about an ice kick in the cunt. 
[00:30:00]  You'll sure have a stump when you go for the punt  with a jolly good kick in the cunt.  Oh, my God.  There you have it.  Jack Black.  We'll be playing that a few times.  I like that one a lot.  It just ended abruptly as you guys were talking about something.  What was that?  A website.  I know we had to do this first,  but there's a fine website that Ant and I sent up with some listener.  Oh, it's hysterical.  It's the greatest website ever.  Okay.  I just ran in here. 
[00:30:30]  How was that song?  It was good.  I didn't like the language, though.  Yeah, it was a little harsh.  Yeah.  Well, Eric's getting some of the clips from the famous Sex for Sam show.  Anthony, for the first time in three years, we get to replay this.  This is the actual phone call.  All right.  This is the phone call.  We got it.  This is it right here.  Here it is.  Now, you might have heard the newscasters saying that this is live sex.  By the way, if you're just tuning in, I got to let everyone know.  It was three years ago today.  We did Sex for Sam and blew up our careers.  It was a huge day in the careers of this fine radio program. 
[00:31:00]  Would have been one of those real big parts of our timeline where they would have had to have a picture and a big paragraph of what happened.  Wow.  Very important day.  You might have heard the newscasters talking about the broadcast, the actual broadcast, what went out over the air.  And some of them said it was a description of pew-rocking sex at St. Pat's, live sex on the air from St. Pat's, a graphic description of a couple having sex at St. Pat's. 
[00:31:30]  Well, all that is bullshit because the fact of the matter is there was nothing graphic, nothing that couldn't be said today over regular radio airwaves.  And I guess we have it here.  All right.  Let's go to Paul and the Juicy Lips before we take a break.  His team is representing D.C. today, Marshall and Lynn.  What's up, Paul?  We're in St. Pat's, and he's doing the balloon nut inside, and the security guy is coming up to us right now. 
[00:32:00]  There you go.  That was it.  That was it, ladies and gentlemen.  Hold on.  You could let the kids out of the room now.  You could let them out of their bedroom, back in the living room to listen in with you once again because that whole graphic description of sex is over.  That was it.  That was it.  It was reported so much differently. 
[00:32:30]  How many of these motherfuckers got on the air and said it was pure rocking sex described live on the airwaves of the Opie and Anthony show?  Just a few feet from where people were praying.  People were praying.  That was it.  There was nothing more.  That was the live description of sex that was carried on our airwaves.  Got to hear it again.  This is the reason we had to take two years and three months off. 
[00:33:00]  Here it is.  All right.  Let's go to Paul and the Juicy Lips before we take a break.  His team is representing D.C. today, Marshall and Lynn.  What's up, Paul?  We're in St. Pat's, and he's doing the balloon knot inside, and the security guy is coming up to us right now.  All right.  All right.  Hey, come on.  Let them go.  They're okay there.  No, let them go.  They were just looking for the restroom.  That's all.  I need to do it.  Really?  No, no.  I need to do it.  I need to do it.  I need to do it.  I need to do it.  What's the problem?  Come to the south side, please. 
[00:33:30]  I need to do the restroom.  No, they were just looking for the restroom.  I thought the door was open.  I'm talking to them.  Well, I can talk to them.  Yeah.  You can talk to them.  Come to the south side.  All right.  Listen.  We'll just split.  All right.  We'll go.  We'll go.  Who's coming right in?  I can't even hear you.  Listen.  You just need to use the restroom.  Don't be such a good reason.  What are you being so difficult for?  Oh, thank God.  He said he would never.  This is a sacrilegious place.  He would never do anything like that.  This is the Catholic Church.  Hey, listen.  You want to be averted? 
[00:34:00]  You'll be quiet, all right?  No.  I'm not going to be quiet.  I have a way to say whatever I want.  See?  That's what ended it all.  Wah, wah, wah.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  In that situation, leave.  Paul and the couple should have just walked away.  Just walk away.  But that anti-Catholic stuff or whatever, which I know he was only saying in the moment.  I mean, I don't think he's anti-Catholic.  He was just saying it in the spirit of what was going on.  But that was what they grabbed onto.  And I'll never say it because it's not illegal. 
[00:34:30]  But that is what I guarantee you they grabbed onto.  And they said, we are really going to hurt these people for this.  But where was the sex?  And it sounded like he was going to talk his way out of it.  It's like, hey, we're just using the bathroom.  We'll leave.  We'll leave.  And at that point, he should have left.  And I think we would have been all right.  Where's the pew rocking sex?  Yeah, where is it?  Where's the sex?  Oh, babe.  They all reported that there was a description of sex.  We gave a graphic description of the sex at St. Pat's.  Nothing. 
[00:35:00]  How much they bullshit the news.  I'm a big fan of getting reporters on the air.  I mean, I think we should try to get some.  I mean, I don't know if we can do it today.  But why not call them out?  They're never called out.  And they're bullshit.  Why did you play the clip of what they said and then play this?  Why did you say that if you hadn't heard the tape?  Chuck from Pittsburgh, if Paul would have kept his smart mouth closed when the security  guy came over, you never would have gotten into hot water.  He was a smart aleck.  Chuck is calling him a smart aleck.  All right, let's continue here.  Listen, you want to be arrested? 
[00:35:30]  You'll be quiet, all right?  No, I'm not going to be quiet.  I have a way to say whatever I want to say.  Just because you have a blue jacket on with a patch on doesn't mean you have authority  over me.  When they give you the walkie-talkie, that doesn't mean you take away my constitutional rights.  We're going to go, all right?  We can do whatever we want.  We walk out.  There's no harm, no foul.  Not a problem with priests due to kids, though, is it?  Yeah, that's right.  That was it.  Hello.  Sealed our fate right there. 
[00:36:00]  But again, in that, no, there's one more line.  Yeah, yeah.  That sealed the fate.  But again, that was just in the moment.  And as much as he and I haven't really hit it off since then, I can't blame it.  I know what he was doing in the moment.  It's like a roller coaster, though.  I was like, all right, he's going to get out of this.  Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.  Shut your mouth.  And then once again, he's like, all right, we'll get out of here.  But then he has to, like, give him a parting shot.  This is like watching the end of Cuckoo's Nest for me.  I can't watch the end of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest because I always say to Nicholson  and Chief, when the window is open and Billy kills himself in the other room, just go! 
[00:36:30]  Just leave.  The window is open.  Go, Randall.  Go.  This is exactly how I feel.  Yeah.  Just walk out.  But you know it always ends the same way.  There's a scream and he has to run in and try to choke Ratchet.  I got a confession to make.  What, Opie?  This is the first time I'm hearing this audio since we did the show.  I couldn't listen to this.  I think I've heard it once on a computer somewhere during the break.  In the past three years, I saw it there on websites.  All I had to do was click. 
[00:37:00]  It's a graphic argument.  Click.  With security.  There's no sex, though.  All I had to do was click, but I just couldn't do it for the last three years.  Well, not a problem with priests due to kids, though, is it?  Yeah, that's what we're doing.  Hey.  I guess when the doors are closed, it happens on the altar, right?  That's what happens right now.  Yeah, it's nothing like meat and potato sex during that church around, right?  No, a heterosexual sex.  Can you bring everybody out here?  I'm a scum guy?  Yeah.  With the proper church, you've done the church for 35 years?  How could you be part of that?  You're culpable. 
[00:37:30]  You should be ashamed of yourself.  They're mean potato sex is what the church needs.  Step up!  Be counted!  And that was a balloon knot, just so you knew.  You're not.  Where's your god now?  Oh, boy.  And we're just laughing like idiots.  Yeah.  I knew we were fired.  We were just laughing like idiots.  There were tears through that laughter.  Was there?  Yeah.  Me, too.  I knew it was over, Johnny.  Where's your god now?  That's wonderful.  Yeah, that's a good one.  That's what a 50-year-old police captain will hear and really get upset. 
[00:38:00]  Just in case you're wondering, it was the balloon knot.  Oh, boy.  Ouch.  All right, we're moving on.  We'll call you back.  All right, Paul.  Wow!  Oh, my God.  27 points.  25 points.  A two-point conversion.  It should be an eternal damnation.  We should be allowed to just give him 200 extra points.  Oh, my God.  The guy has a sack that is too huge to believe.  You cannot... 
[00:38:30]  You cannot...  How the hell?  Did you hear him?  Yeah.  We'll just let that sit.  And you can see how at least we knew something was wrong, so the radio show condemned it immediately.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, exactly, right?  That's great.  Fantastic.  Let me give the point count.  We really were fucking Eddie Egger.  We do just think.  Oh, man.  That was terrible.  It's doing math instead of going, oh, let's see.  25, two-point conversion.  Yeah, 27 points. 
[00:39:00]  Let's keep the game going.  I just want to give them the title at that moment.  I'm not even thinking.  Ben was...  Ben, before the show, I got to say, Ben knew it, and I remember him saying it.  Yeah?  Yes, I do.  But he said it shouldn't be on the list.  Don't do it.  Do not do it.  Ah, don't.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  I'm telling you.  Don't do it.  And he was right.  He was right.  It hasn't been since.  No, it was the last good decision Ben almost made.  All right, let's go to Joe on Whack Bag.  Joe?  Hey, how's it going, man?  Hey, man.  How's it going?  Happy birthday, little Jimmy. 
[00:39:30]  Thanks.  Yeah, I was calling in.  I remember the last day you guys were actually on the air.  I think it was the following Monday.  I remember, it might have been what you guys signed off with.  I hope he said something like, yeah, well, we think everything's going to be okay, guys.  Yeah, it was a rough weekend, but everything's going to be all right.  And then I went and I turned on the radio the next day, and it was Cousin Ed playing the best rock in Philly.  Yikes.  Well, he couldn't have said worst weekend.  I believe it happened on a Thursday, and our last live broadcast was on a Friday.  They actually let us on the air the next day, which is just amazing. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, we had Brian Regan on.  We had Brian Regan on, and we couldn't even refer to the event.  Don't mention it.  And that's, by the way, that's why I don't hate Donahue like I thought I would.  I much more fault the company for just handling it so horribly and not just seeing what would happen,  just panicking like they do in all of radio and just backing out immediately.  They're just like cowards.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think you guys were on for like two more broadcasts.  No, one.  No, trust me.  We know.  We know. 
[00:40:30]  Dude, it was best of for a week.  Yeah.  Or until the following Thursday, and then it went off.  Okay.  All right, guys.  Have a good day.  Thanks.  So then that's what happened.  And then, of course, we come back from commercials, and we have to get Paul back on the air.  We've got to go back to the Juicy Lifts.  Yes, Paul?  Yeah, I just, the cop just came in.  He left.  He said if we go back in, he's going to arrest us.  Oh.  They call the cops. 
[00:41:00]  And I told him, you know, we weren't doing anything.  We were just, you know, observing the, what is it, the Sabbath?  I don't know.  Whatever.  All right.  And they said, you know, you go back in, and you've got to retow it.  All right.  He's just coming back to play.  Hey, Paul, can you go back in and get your poor box money back?  Like, I think he was kind of standing there, like, just kind of enjoying the moment, instead  of just hopping into a cab and amscraining.  Beat it. 
[00:41:30]  And for years, I was pissed that he didn't get out of there, but they were going to, they  were going to, no, I'm still angry on many levels, but they were going to find this couple  no matter what.  They would have found them, dude, but an actual arrest there, I think, made it so much more.  Or to have them come in and go to Virginia, it just would have been deluded a little bit.  They could have scrammed.  You've got to understand, after Paul did what he did, yeah, everyone's on their walkie-talkies.  The NYPD has been called, and they're now on their way to St. Pat's Cathedral. 
[00:42:00]  Shoulda, coulda, woulda.  So they should have got out of there.  I hope for the best, but they were just kind of hanging around.  And one of the funniest things is how Paul wasn't getting arrested through this whole  thing, and he couldn't understand why he wasn't getting arrested.  Yeah.  I hate to say it, but he was looking for a lot of attention that day himself.  Hate to say it.  I've been saying that for three years.  That was what my problem with him was.  Not that he went into the, and I've told him this.  I mean, it wasn't that he went into the church.  It wasn't that he went over the top, because again, I understood what he was doing.  It was the fact that when I started coming on your show and things started going good for 
[00:42:30]  me as a comedian, you started selling tickets, and other guys see that and go, wow, this is great.  And the voyeur bus for me, that arrest, was a huge moment on Opie and Anthony.  Well, then you have this opportunity where you see, like, this is a moment.  You know, sometimes you can sense, this is a moment.  What am I going to do with it?  And that went into play, and he would never admit that.  But that went into play, I think.  Yeah.  It was that desire to all of a sudden hit that home run and go, wow, now I'm a major part  of this show.  Yeah, he was thinking this would blow him up. 
[00:43:00]  Great press.  Right.  He would blow way up.  Yeah.  So you guys are okay?  Why don't you do that?  You guys are all right?  Yeah, they're cool.  It was a little dicey, but we're cool.  They're really cool, man.  They blew me away.  I thought I had the dead ones.  They're insane.  All right.  It's a trick.  I'll call in a minute.  I've got something else going on.  I'll call in a minute.  Thank you.  There you go, the juicy lips.  It looks like they're going to be okay.  It's so weird to hear this.  Way to read it. 
[00:43:30]  Like I said, I haven't heard this in three years.  Way to read it.  Still, we're not reading it.  Okay, good.  They're going to be all right.  Yeah, no, everything's fine.  Looks great.  Maybe we'll get a little mention in David Hinckley's tiny little radio column.  You know.  It looks fine.  I think the cops put their hat on him and they're eating an ice cream cone down at the station.  Everything's fine.  Sitting on the hood of the car.  What dopes we are.  Ah, it looks like it's just going to be fine, everyone.  And then Paul called back. 
[00:44:00]  Right before commercials, we had Paul Mercurio.  Now here we are exploiting it.  Yeah.  Like I said, I haven't heard any of this in three years.  I had no idea we started playing cops.  We stink.  The cops theme.  Right before commercials, we had Paul Mercurio in St. Patrick's Cathedral, Anthony.  The St. Patrick's Cathedral.  And his couple allegedly did the two-point conversion.  The two-pointer. 
[00:44:30]  And there was a little altercation between Paul and the guard that was in there.  There was some words.  And Paul's got a big set of brass balls because he doesn't back down.  And now I'm getting reports of police.  Paul.  Paulie.  Yeah, well, listen, officer.  I don't understand.  If you're going to take us down to the station, then take us down and do the investigation.  But we're standing here and you're taking one person's opinion.  Yeah.  Here, I have my money card that has my name on it. 
[00:45:00]  And a credit card and a money card.  I don't have enough picture ID.  He's talking to six cops right now.  They want to take all three to the station.  Yeah, at this point now, they've got six cops.  More on the way.  There was plenty of time to leave.  They just converged on the scene.  And then Paul's asking to be taken down to the station house. 
[00:45:30]  Because the cop, according to the call, the cop originally said, if you go back in there, I'm going to arrest you.  If he would have just said, no, no, no, there was nothing.  They had to pee and whatever.  Yeah, just be called about and go, yeah, whatever.  Jump into a cab.  The cops are going to chase a cab.  What happened?  That was a couple of hours.  They left.  You know, they don't want to deal with that shit.  Hell no.  If I pulled up, you would see that I'm swollen.  I asked you, we went in there to try and find a restroom.  The place that we went up into, I thought that that was a restroom. 
[00:46:00]  What is he saying that he saw?  What is the security guy saying he saw?  It's really hard to hear.  I can hear it.  What's your relationship?  These are friends of mine.  I'm taking them around the city.  I'm giving them a tour to the city.  We put them into the church.  And, you know, what are they doing?  The church is their business.  And this guy, he comes up from behind them and he gets on the walkie-talkie.  And, you know, suddenly, you know, he's a Lone Ranger.  And he calls in the city.  He calls in the cavalry.  And you guys show up. 
[00:46:30]  And there's five guys in a squad car.  And if you're going to take it to the station, take it to the station.  You're going to arrest us.  Let's arrest us.  Let's get it over with.  But I don't know what the basis is for the arrest.  You can't.  I said to him, you were trying to get arrested.  And he said, no, I wasn't.  I was trying to do compelling radio.  That is trying to get arrested.  Yeah.  I know, because I have this weird grasp of English language.  And when somebody says, arrest us, that means you want to get arrested.  Yeah.  You can't challenge the cops to arrest you.  The basis is for the arrest. 
[00:47:00]  And I don't think you can know either, otherwise you'd be arrested by now.  Let's be honest.  I'm not trying to be a spot-off.  But, you know, bring him over.  And if he wants to talk about this, look me in the eye and let him tell me what he thinks he saw.  But if you're conducting an investigation and you're about to arrest the three of us, don't you think you should talk to us?  You don't need to see what he's doing right now.  Well, look, I think it's going, honestly, no disrespect.  I think it's going in one ear and out the other. 
[00:47:30]  And you've already made your decision.  So let's get in the car, in the air condition, and let's go.  Okay.  You're entitled to your event.  Yeah.  You know what?  Frankly, I am.  If I want you to wander around you, you would be in the account.  You would be in the account.  Well, I haven't made that determination.  No.  They haven't decided to arrest you.  Why don't you start getting yourself all excited to take my advice?  Take a breath.  Until it all comes down.  Why don't you mind now?  Well, this is 15 minutes of nonsense.  We left the church when we were told to leave. 
[00:48:00]  We walked down the sidewalk.  He called that gentleman, and that gentleman came tearing down the sidewalk for us.  It's like you guys are looking to do something with us.  We left, and we were told to leave.  Three guys escorted us out.  On top of it, it's the Catholic Church.  How can they be moral about sex?  We can't have that for a minute.  That's what he was saying.  He should just...  Oh, he should have just shut his mouth.  Oh, my God.  Now he's bringing up the fact that it's the Catholic Church to the cop, and... 
[00:48:30]  They can't be moral about sex.  Yeah.  Don't try to explain it to him.  Just be courteous.  Understanding with the cops.  Talk to them nicely, and they would have let you leave.  That's what happened.  Oh, it is painful to listen to.  Church, how can they be moral about sex?  Speak about God for a minute.  That's what he was saying.  He was saying that we were having sex in there, to us, to our faith. 
[00:49:00]  That's not what you said.  I'm trying to get your side with the door.  I'm trying to get the story.  If these people are in there looking at the church, he had to go to the bathroom.  He's saying that they were having sex.  There's a show going on outside here.  Patrick's Cathedral right now.  Should we put him on hold for a second, Andrew?  Is that right if we just go out?  No, no.  I kind of want to hear that.  Okay.  I don't understand what the basis is for detaining us, then. 
[00:49:30]  Someone would like to tell me that.  That would be great.  Anytime today.  Jesus.  Oh, man.  Now you see why nothing gets done.  All right.  Bad guy standing around trying to figure out what the charges were.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We're being.  We're being.  All right.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  We're back live here.  We're listening to the tape of three years ago.  Sex for Sam.  It's the anniversary today.  And you remember how you asked one time, how did I get to go on Infinity Stations and plug gigs?  Yeah. 
[00:50:00]  Because the guys that listen to the tape really weren't familiar with the show.  Yeah.  So they heard this whole thing, and they didn't hear my voice.  That was probably how they allowed it.  Not a peep out of Little Jimmy.  Yeah.  Were you in that day?  Oh, certainly was.  I haven't heard you yet.  I'll tell you why.  I did a gig for the Cleveland Browns with Bob Kelly the night before.  Yeah.  It was me, Bob Kelly, and LL Cool J.  And I flew home that morning.  And I was on no sleep.  I was exhausted because I was coming right off a flight into the studio.  Lucky you.  Yeah.  You didn't say a word. 
[00:50:30]  It's like you knew.  No, I didn't.  It's like Jimmy knew this was going to happen and let us hang out to dry.  Not at all.  So now it's a complete mess outside St. Pat's Cathedral, and Paul's pretty much wondering  why they're being held.  Mm-hmm.  Begging to be arrested.  Begging to be arrested.  I believe he had to take his own cab down to the police station because they didn't arrest him.  He didn't arrest him.  He had to drive himself to the station.  He drove himself to the station.  Well, he had a cab get him to the station, and then finally the police were like, all right, 
[00:51:00]  dude, Jesus.  Yeah.  And he arrested him down there.  It's the first time someone ever said to a cabbie, follow that car, and it was a police  car.  Right.  Exactly.  All right.  We have a little more here.  Here, let's go back to Paul.  The Juicy Whips.  Outside St. Patrick's Cathedral.  This guy.  Paul.  Yeah.  Can you hear us?  Yeah.  What's going on?  I have not wanted to talk.  Now, I've got to just be careful because they haven't told me to take my earphone out 
[00:51:30]  or anything.  I don't want them to know that I'm on the air.  But there's just like five cops are standing around like debating this at this point.  But they kicked us out, and then they came tearing down the sidewalk, and they put us  against the wall.  The front car, they put our hands against the wall, and that whole nonsense, and potted  us down and everything.  And now they brought a sergeant in, and now another guy's showing up in another car.  Oh, you're dumb.  And they're like the security guy from the church.  Yeah.  And by the way, the guy I'm with, the guy of the couple is on probation. 
[00:52:00]  And he's freaking out.  And he's like, I'll tell him we did it, and then we'll just say it's a radio prank.  I'm like, no, if you admit it, no, no.  He's about to collapse.  I like you.  All the sex and the heat and this, I think he's going to have a stroke.  I like your take on the whole thing.  There's nothing, the guards saw nothing, and there's no crime.  Yeah, no, exactly.  And I think we'll be, I think we'll be okay, because if he's just going to do something 
[00:52:30]  right now, he probably would have.  Yeah, Evan is saying, Paul, just show them your Emmy.  All right, hold on.  Yeah, good call.  Yeah, everything will be fine.  Legal evils.  Yeah, no, I see.  No crime has been committed.  That's right.  They'll let you go.  There's sergeants pulling up.  Did you know at that point, I started feeling a little like, uh-oh, they're going to get arrested. 
[00:53:00]  It's kind of weird to listen to this for the first time in three years, because I swear,  after we hung up with him the first time, I was thinking we're done.  Yeah, but obviously not.  I know, because it sounds a lot different, what we're hearing now.  You know what it is?  It's that fine line.  I think I had just adrenaline and energy after that, so I think I was just kind of going  with the radio show still, but inside, deep inside, I'm like, oh, man, we are so screwed.  There's a fine line in radio, in talk radio.  It's you kind of know that you're going to get in trouble, but the moment is so good for 
[00:53:30]  radio for what you're doing, that you stay in it, and you want to milk it for all it's  worth, you know, because you're thinking, hey, this will get press, you know, you're  not thinking you're going to get fired.  I think I knew we were going to get press about it, especially if they got arrested,  and we'd probably catch some flack, but I thought they'd supported us enough where  they wouldn't fire us.  You've got to remember the environment of radio, too, when this went down three years  ago.  So, you know, a show like ours being syndicated to close to 20 cities across America with 
[00:54:00]  huge ratings and all the demos we needed to have huge ratings in, making millions and  millions of dollars for the company, you just didn't fire a show for that.  No, no.  For anything.  You'd somehow figure out, you know, how to get through it.  They fired us.  It was the first time that, you know, a show with a lot of ratings was fired in that way.  Yep.  And then after this broadcast and after our firing, you know, radio definitely changed  a bit, and they started firing people for doing things that was a lot less worse than 
[00:54:30]  this.  And there's actually, now people think this radio show has gotten soft and changed, but  we're having this big contest today that, like, but there's no sex.  You have to go to, like, places in New York wearing an Opie and Anthony hat.  Oh!  Now, now.  We'd get into big trouble.  Get a picture with your thumbs up somewhere, maybe with a hard rock.  Let's say hi to Alan.  Alan, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, Alan.  Hey, Mike.  Hey, I hate to backtrack, but what is a balloon knot?  Ah, the balloon knot. 
[00:55:00]  That's a term we used to have to use on the air, because you couldn't say what it was.  Let me see if I could have you guess what it is.  I don't think I could do it.  All right.  Well, let me help you out.  You ever blow up a balloon?  Yeah.  And then you tie the end in a knot?  Mm-hmm.  Now, look at the part that you just blew into.  What does that look like?  That helped.  That helped.  We're a little slow out here in West Texas.  That's all right.  Sheep have that, too. 
[00:55:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  Let me know, boys.  You're a new listener to the show, Alan, huh?  Yes, sir.  So you had no idea about this thing?  No.  That's kind of weird.  All right.  Trying to spread the virus here in Odessa.  We appreciate it, sir.  All right, yes.  The balloon knot is, of course, the asshole.  The actual hole part of it.  Let's go to Frankie.  Frankie, what's up?  A little tight-up balloon.  Frankie.  Hey, Frankie.  Frankie.  Yo, what's up, guys?  What's up, Frankie?  Nothing.  I'm just listening to the show now.  About a year ago on Wackbag, there was some sort of email from Opie saying that you said 
[00:56:00]  something to the effect of We're Fucked before the show went on the air.  No.  What?  Not conspiracy stuff.  No, it's not a conspiracy.  It was a letter I wrote when?  Buddy, this letter came out after the show, after you guys got fired.  I guess you were recapping on the message board and said that you said something about 
[00:56:30]  We're Fucked at the beginning of the show.  Yeah.  Because of the church being on the list.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, the following day, yeah.  Oh, that'll happen the following day?  I believe so.  We went on the air the next day and I said something like, I guess what happened during  our intro music or something, you could hear me in the background going, we're effed.  Yeah.  Or something like that.  I don't know.  I forget now because I haven't heard this audio in a long time now.  But yeah, something like that. 
[00:57:00]  In the background, you could hear me going, oh, we're effed.  Something like that.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  All right, bro.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Here's another call from Paul.  Let's go back to Paul.  Listen, I'm going to go with him.  Can I go down with him?  Can I go with him?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is, you know.  Now they're arresting the couple.  And there's Paul pleading with the cop to be allowed to go with them.  He is trying his best to be arrested.  Because he cares so much about the couple.  Can I go with him?  And the cop says, take a cab. 
[00:57:30]  Can you hear that in the background?  Yeah.  The cop says, take a cab.  Take a cab.  Well, that sounds like the cop's really trying to arrest you.  Take a cab and make sure you do.  Let's go back to Paul.  But listen, I'm going to go with him.  Can I go down with him?  Can I go with him?  No.  Can I go in the car with him?  Well, if you're going to arrest them, arrest me then.  What's the difference?  I don't care.  This is ridiculous.  You don't want to take me because they're afraid to say anything.  And you know that you guys are wrong.  Go ahead and take me.  I don't care. 
[00:58:00]  This is ridiculous.  You guys got to have something better to do than this.  Look at me.  I'm 5'8", soaking wet.  I'm 150 pounds.  I can't do anything.  And you're like, getting all tough.  This is ridiculous.  Oh, man.  He's crying.  Officer.  Officer.  Can I talk to you for a minute?  I won't even talk to me now.  What happened, Paul?  He took them in handcuffs and put them in a car.  They're taking them to Midtown North.  Oh, no.  Oh, one of our teams is arrested. 
[00:58:30]  Can I go down with him at least in the car?  Can I go in the car with him?  Yes.  All right.  Well, I'm going to go down.  I'm going to take a cab over there to the precinct.  Why?  All right, Paul.  All right.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  Well, that's the first time one of our teams have ever been arrested.  Well, someone send someone down there to get them out of jail.  You could hear in our voices.  Right there, it was like. 
[00:59:00]  Our voices finally dropped.  The adrenaline is going another way now, and you could tell.  That was my biggest complaint.  This is going to get ugly.  Right there.  Arrest me.  Boy, if that isn't a guy really trying hard to be arrested.  And not that it wouldn't have been bad otherwise, but that was the direct tie-in to the show,  because then they kept saying the producer was arrested with them.  It just.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  That was brutal.  When we got arrested on the voyeur bus, you know what I did when the cops came on the bus? 
[00:59:30]  I shut my fucking mouth.  That's what you do.  Because it was a real event.  It was like everybody shut up.  Psycho Mark called from the back of the paddy wagon.  He called you guys.  I'm like, just fucking hang up, stupid.  What are you doing?  Fuck the show.  We're going to jail.  I remember that, Jimmy.  You took your pinch like a man.  You kept your mouth shut and you didn't wrap.  Let's say hi to Brian.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Real quick question.  I mean, if you could go back and change this and, you know, get the last two years back and whatnot and not go to XM, would you do it? 
[01:00:00]  Or, you know, at the end of the day, was this actually worth it?  It was.  I might let those guys answer, but I got to say, it actually, corny, but it's the best thing that ever happened.  And I know it sounds cliche, but first of all, they would have been fired anyway.  I could speak for the boys.  There's no way that this fucking radio show would have lasted in that climate.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, because especially after the Janet Jackson thing.  Yeah, how you guys would have been.  We would have been fucked. 
[01:00:30]  I mean, I think at some point we probably would have done something that would have gotten us fired.  Yeah, we were on a runaway train.  We just were out of control.  We know that.  And if we survived somehow the Sex for Sam thing, then we would have had to top the Sex for Sam thing.  Yeah, we were on a can you top this train ride.  There was no winning.  We were doing a can you top this type of radio show for three or four years straight.  It started with a little thing, and then the next thing was a little bigger. 
[01:01:00]  And then we got the C word on live TV, then the voyeur bus, then it was just out of control.  So every time we made the news, it had to be bigger than the last time.  I don't see where we were going to just sit down one day in a back room and go, all right, guys, enough with this out of control type of radio.  Yeah.  We've taken as far as we can.  We just our mentality back then was, all right, what can we do next?  Yeah.  What can we do next to get our names out there and just shock people and make people cringe, you know?  Yeah.  I love the show, boys, and I'm spreading the virus for you here in North Carolina. 
[01:01:30]  Take care.  Thank you, Brian.  It made me a better comedian, as corny as that is, too, because it forced me just to do material.  I did Tough Crowd for two years, which forced me to write.  I mean, it was just no choice.  I mean, that's what you do when you're off and you're ready to shoot yourself.  Yeah.  You know, you just, yeah.  I mean, so in hindsight, it worked out, but in the time, it was the worst thing that ever happened to me.  Yeah.  I want to hear the Regan show, part of the show the next day.  Like, at least the first break, if we, how we sound, because I knew we knew the jig was up. 
[01:02:00]  It was over, Gianni.  Well, you know, we should have had all this prepared before we walked in today, so we'll try to get some of that audio, too, for you, Anthony.  Yeah, I'd like to hear, like, our first break from the show the next day.  Okay, and also the last break that day would be fun.  Yeah.  First break, last break.  Do we say your mom's box?  Yes.  Oh, hell yeah, we do.  That's the last thing we said.  The last words we said on the live radio program for, like, two years and three months.  It's very painful to listen to.  It is rough.  So, there you have it.  You want to take a break?  I got to tinkle.  I got to tinkle. 
[01:02:30]  I got to tinkle.  He's scared.  On the way, we got new stuff to do today as well, but we're kind of taking a look back, because it was three years ago today, and it was obviously a big, big, big day for us, our fans, the stupid media, radio in general.  Later on in the program, our enemies spoke out.  Yes.  And we're going to play some of their stupid comments.  Freaking idiots thinking they know what's going to happen to us.  All right?  Bastards.  And also on the show today, Cal Ripken. 
[01:03:00]  Yes.  Calling you at 10 a.m.  Wow.  Tony Raimondo is coming in.  He's the editor of Sync Magazine.  He's always a lot of fun.  Also, Chris Fleming.  He's a psychic in studio in a little while.  So, what?  A psychic.  Is that this guy?  Yeah.  He's the dead famous guy?  Dead famous ghostly encounters.  Ghostly encounters.  It premieres Tuesday, August 16th at 10 p.m. on the Biography Channel.  Detects paranormal events beyond the range of five senses? 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, we'll see what he's about.  You remember the Chris Angel we had in?  Yeah.  I felt like, what kind of show is this going to be?  I watched it.  It was good, man.  I only watched, like, 10 minutes of it, but, I mean, I don't know how much of it's real, how much of it's cameras.  I have no idea.  He's insane with the meat hooks in his back.  He's a fucking problem.  I enjoy the show.  Mind Freak is a good show.  Yeah, it's really good.  It's a really good show.  So, all right, why don't we step aside?  We'll regroup.  We'll continue.  Hi, this is Jay Moore.  Hey, this is Chris Jericho.  This is Bernie Getz.  This is definitely Flavor Flavor on your radio. 
[01:04:00]  This is Bill Burrow, the red-headed white boy from Chappelle Show.  This is Lois Griffin from Family Guy.  Hey, this is adult film star and former gubernatorial candidate, Mary Kay.  This is Jeffrey Ross.  Hey, this is Terry Jones here of Multibus.  Hey, what up, y'all?  This is Tracy Morgan, a.k.a.  Brian Fellows.  Hey, this is the game, Triple H.  This is your big baby girl, Patrice O'Neal.  How are you, sweetie?  Hey, it's Colin Quinn.  This is Samset Thomas.  Hey, this is Seth Green.  Hey, this is Ridge Boss from Last Comic Standing, season one and season three.  Hey, this is Tommy Jones.  Hey, this is Larry the Cable Guy. 
[01:04:30]  Hey, this is Ozzy Osbourne.  And y'all listening to O.P. and Anthony.  Said you're smart.  You're not dumb.  Let's see what they think.  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?  Is someone taking the faith?  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you? 
[01:05:00]  All right, thank you for listening to the O.P. and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio  as we rebuild our radio careers.  You're listening to the pioneers of satellite radio.  So I guess maybe it was the best thing that ever happened to us.  I don't know.  Take a look back today.  It was three years ago today that we did our Sex with Sam thing.  That turned out to be an international story, by the way.  Yes.  It was all over the world, reported all over the world in many, many different languaged newspapers. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Haywood Jablomi, of course, from Melbourne, Florida.  That's not his real name, Anthony.  Of course it's not, Jimmy.  He says, you should have had the psychic on three years ago.  That's very funny, sir.  Ass.  Rub it in.  Yeah, sure.  Very good.  All right.  Well, we'll have more audio.  We're going to get the audio of our show after the fact. 
[01:06:00]  The next day.  The next day, yes.  The first break from the next day and the last break from the next day.  Yeah.  So we'll get into that as well.  There was something else I wanted to say about this, but blah, blah, blah.  I can't think offhand.  Can't think.  Can't think.  Can't think right now.  Russell Crowe, to pay hotel employee $11 million for throwing phone at him.  Is this true?  Lotto.  Lotto.  The guy won Lotto.  Yeah.  You're just sitting down there in the hotel.  What, he was at the desk or something? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  And Russell Crowe comes down and throws a phone at you.  You get a little bruise to the side of your face.  $11 million.  For $11 million, I'd let Robert Reed throw the phone at me while he was on the phone at the hospital going, help me, I'm bleeding from the ear and mouth.  Jesus.  $11 million, I'm sorry.  I just don't get it.  That is, it's gone beyond compensation. 
[01:07:00]  It's gotten into extortion.  Because what this is, is that's this guy's lawyer turning around and telling Russell Crowe's lawyers, hey, you pay this guy money or we're going to make a thing of it.  We'll take it to court, we'll, we'll, you're going to have problems working in the United States again.  And, uh, they extorted $11 million out of this guy.  I'm trying to find another story too, which I had and I'm so annoyed.  If you want to make a relative comparison to just how much life sucks. 
[01:07:30]  But there's a woman who had, she was misdiagnosed with breast cancer.  She didn't have it.  And they, they chopped off her breast in some type of like a radical quick surgery.  She sued $800,000.  That's it.  That's what she got for having a breast accidentally removed.  $800,000.  $11 million.  She was $85,000.  I mean, so maybe it's a different compensation than it would be if you were $20,000.  Jesus.  But $85,000 and they cut off the, well, she has that tit for $85,000 years. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, I mean, I think they were doing her a favor if she was $85,000 years old.  Yeah.  That thing must have been hanging.  Yeah, I'm sure it didn't look right.  Oh, sorry, ladies.  Oh, please, you're right.  It's fine.  Just, even they're going, eh.  No, I guess they figure all that crap out though.  Figure it out.  How valuable, valuable you are, you know, based on your age.  When some of this stuff happens to you.  Yeah, but that guy gets $11 million.  That's nothing.  That is completely based on the fact that it's Russell Crowe.  Yeah. 
[01:08:30]  Who has a lot of money.  And this guy wasn't really that injured.  What did he get out of it?  Like a bruise or something?  To the side of the face.  He goes to the side of the face.  That was it.  Which, you know, fine.  Give him something.  But $11 million for that?  $11 million.  Stop it.  I don't blame the guy though.  Because if I was on the phone, if I was down there and some douchey actor just came and  threw the phone at my face.  You know, that's got to make you go, you motherfucker.  All you guys who come into this hotel are making this kind of money and I'm making basically  shit except for tips and you throw a phone at my skull. 
[01:09:00]  I mean, that's got to really just make you want to take the guy to the cleaners.  But this just makes other people look at it and no matter what happens to them, they  start suing everybody.  The city, this, you know.  And it all trickles down to the taxpayer eventually.  So it's just, I don't know.  I don't see $11 million for a bruise on the face.  I agree.  Loss of life?  Something like that?  Sure.  $11 million is fine.  But something like this?  No.  I don't see it.  Jesus.  Give the guy free movie tickets.  All right. 
[01:09:30]  Give him a copy of Gladiator.  What's Elo doing on TV?  Oh my God.  There's a guy on CNN right now who's just got probably the worst hair.  That's got to be a wig.  It has to be a wig.  That's a wig.  Elo's hair used to look like that.  That is a wig.  Until he changed barbers.  But it's on backwards, that wig.  That is the worst thing I've ever seen on somebody's head.  And this guy's also wearing the Elo starter suit.  Yeah.  Which is like...  Elo used to wear suits like that when he first got to Exxon.  Who is this guy?  This guy is the head of some...  He's an editor of a newspaper. 
[01:10:00]  This guy is out appealing his manslaughter conviction, the Klansman for the Mississippi Burning.  Yeah.  How the fuck is this guy out of jail and Fat Nick still in jail?  How is this guy who killed three civil rights workers out of fucking jail while stupid Fat Nick they won't give bail to?  Free Fat Nick.  I'm really sick of this guy sitting in jail.  This ex-Klansman free on bail.  Holy shit.  They figure he ain't going nowhere.  You know, he's in that wheelchair.  There is no consistency in the judicial system in this country. 
[01:10:30]  None.  None at all.  800,000, 11 million.  All right.  Jackson, Mississippi, too.  Good point.  You know, they're a little different down there.  He said he was sorry.  All right.  Let's take a look at the movies over the weekend.  The box office receipts, as they like to say.  I'd like to guess.  Can I guess what the number one movie was?  Well, yeah.  But let's start with...  We'll go with 10 because I don't know half these movies.  What the hell is going on? 
[01:11:00]  Hopey.  You must have plunked a phone line down.  I don't know if I did, though.  Yeah, I'll be his hand was not there.  That was weird.  10th place.  The Great Raid.  Yeah, that's an army movie.  That's an army movie.  Well, it made $3.3 million.  I know what number one is.  Deuce Bigelow.  Wrong.  But who's in The Great Raid?  Don't know who's in that.  It kind of looked like a cool movie.  Oh, we don't have the psychic today? 
[01:11:30]  Oh, boy.  See, this is why I hate psychics.  Stop.  Stop.  Come on.  What happened?  Why can't we ever have a guest?  Every guest has an excuse.  Why they can't make our radio program.  This is great.  He foresees a bad segment.  Don't look at number one, by the way.  Chris Fleming is this guy.  His show's called Dead Famous.  Premieres Tuesday, August 16th at 10 p.m.  on the Biography Channel.  Why doesn't he call us?  He was supposed to come in.  He's a psychic.  Chris Fleming stuck in Chicago due to the weather last night. 
[01:12:00]  But if he's a psychic...  Bad old gag.  If he's a psychic, shouldn't he...  And then he...  I need an earlier flight out.  I foresee bad weather.  Right.  That's exactly what I'm thinking.  He stinks.  He's awful.  If he's talking to dead people, you would think he would know that a storm's coming.  Because you could even do some research online.  Yeah.  He says he's chit-chatted with dead celebrities.  Sightings of legendary figures. 
[01:12:30]  James Dean, Lucille Ball, Jim Morrison, Marilyn Monroe.  What about Dr. Frank Fields?  How about you have a little conversation on what the weather is with that guy?  Oh, God.  All right.  So The Great Raid, a war movie, ninth place, must love dogs.  Ugh!  Chick Flick.  Chick Flick.  Mm.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Yeah, that's an awful movie. 
[01:13:00]  And it's a new trend in Hollywood, by the way.  It's the older woman with the younger guy.  Whoa.  Mm.  You know, they're going with that angle again.  Yeah.  Then you got Sky High in eighth place.  Sky High.  Which one was that?  I don't know.  Who's in that?  It's like all the superhero kids going to the same high school.  And they have, like, powers, too.  Like, they're parents.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Not the Incredibles?  It might as well be, yeah.  They have parents.  Like, they have, like, they have parents.  Fuck me. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, you screwed it up.  I certainly did.  You didn't get it far enough into it for me to realize you screwed up.  I was going to say they have powers like their parents, which means they put on capes,  and then they drink and beat their spouses.  But, of course, it was a mediocre joke that I fumbled anyway, which makes it an awful joke.  Suck.  Kurt Russell's the star in that, I think, right?  Ah, then it's got to be good.  All right.  So, seventh place.  Yeah, baby.  March of the Penguins.  March of the Penguins is in seventh place.  People still marching to the movies. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, baby.  Oh, baby.  March of the Penguins.  Let's see.  Sixth place, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  That movie has made $183 million thus far.  Total bomb.  Fifth place, Anthony, Deuce Bigelow.  I'm sorry.  Deuce Bigelow in fifth place.  See, I thought that would have debuted number one.  How much did it make?  Had to make, what, 20 mil?  It made $9.4 million.  $9.4 million.  What a bomb.  But that shows you where Hollywood is if that's fifth place. 
[01:14:30]  Deuce Bigelow.  Wedding Crashers.  Oh, still there.  Another $12 million for The Wedding Crashers.  Jimmy, comment?  Jimmy's favorite movie.  I'll see it.  I know I'm trashy because I have a weird thing with Owen Wilson, but he is a good actor.  And I've actually heard it was funny, so I can't shit on him until I see it.  I have to, you know, be fair.  Wayne in Chicago?  Yeah.  Go ahead, Wayne.  I live in Chicago.  Beautiful weather last night. 
[01:15:00]  No rain, no clouds.  Just a gorgeous night.  It wasn't the weather that you're taking off in.  It's the weather you're landing in, sir.  Oh.  The weather here was atrocious.  Oh, you know what?  It was like a friggin' apocalyptic weather we had last night.  You're right.  The thunder and lightning.  And then I'm sitting in front of the computer a couple of times, and we have one of those  two-second little blackouts.  Yeah.  So you're sitting there, and all of a sudden the monitor goes, and the speakers go, and  the subwoofer hits.  It scares the shit out of you. 
[01:15:30]  The lights go out.  Frightening.  There was a lady on TV that said that it felt like it was raining so hard.  Cats and dogs?  Hold on to your hats, people.  Okay.  It was raining so hard that she felt like she was under Niagara Falls.  Yeah.  Wow.  Niagara Falls.  It was that bad, she said.  So the rain, what, pulverized her against rocks? 
[01:16:00]  No?  And we all had that experience of walking under Niagara Falls, so we would be able to make  that comparison, right?  Who's the other reporter that said it rained so hard she felt like a fly on a toilet seat?  Third place.  This is a huge surprise.  The Dukes of Hazzard.  I thought this movie would do a little better.  How much did that open, though?  Huh?  When did it open?  Last week?  Maybe last week, so it's the second weekend?  Yeah.  So it's made $57 million to date. 
[01:16:30]  Good.  Stupid Keith Robinson bet somebody that it wouldn't make $30 million.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  What an idiot.  Because there's a Confederate flag on the roof of the car.  That's his motivation right there.  Someone once said you'd never go broke underestimating the stupidity of the American public.  Is that what it is, or is it overestimating?  Is that P.T. Barnum?  Yeah, it might have been him.  I said someone, like it was just some fucking jerk-off online in the Crousers.  Some guy I was talking to downstairs by the elevator.  Well, I'm glad I didn't say I was talking to him.  What's that?  A penny saved is a penny earned. 
[01:17:00]  Well, a penny's on the dollar.  Second place, The Skeleton Key with Kate Hudson.  What's that?  Oh, that's a horror movie.  Yeah.  They said, I don't know, the reviews are awful for the movie.  What's the number one?  Like the scenes aren't that scary, blah, blah, blah.  Number one, Four Brothers.  Oh, yeah, that looks realistic.  But the preview looked really good in the movie.  Mark Wahlberg.  I like you.  Some black guys. 
[01:17:30]  Huh?  Mark Wahlberg and some black guys.  Yeah, why not?  And they share a mother.  Yeah, why not?  For some reason.  It was an adopted mom.  She gets killed.  She gets killed, and then they go figure it out.  Find who killed her.  Yeah, it's like a murder mystery thing.  Yeah, that sounds good.  Put guns and gangs and drugs.  I'll see that one.  Lots of violence.  I'll go see that one.  The preview looked really good.  Let's say hi to John in Utah.  John, what's up?  Yeah, you guys getting fired back.  She was the best thing that happened to you.  I was a Seattle boy before I moved down to Utah, and I would have never heard of you 
[01:18:00]  guys if you hadn't gotten on XM, and you guys are awesome.  Thank you, my friend.  Thank you, sir.  And I like toast.  All right, you like toast.  He likes toast guy.  Let's say hi to the movie reviewer.  What's up, movie reviewer?  Hey, I watched Deuce Bigelow this weekend.  Funniest movie I've seen I couldn't tell you in.  You're the guy.  Funniest movie I've seen I couldn't tell you in.  What movie?  Deuce Bigelow.  Deuce Bigelow.  Metal Jigelow.  All right. 
[01:18:30]  Thank you, sir.  He's the guy.  That movie's going to be a complete bomb.  All right, here we go.  Let's play some more audio.  It was three years ago today.  Sex for Sam.  Blew up our careers.  Yeah.  Three years.  And radio hasn't been the same since.  Now it seems like it's zipped on by.  It's taken quite a while during the time, wasn't it?  Every phone call to Bob, we'd be on the road, open, take a phone call, it'd be Bob, and I'd  be like, oh, I wonder if this is the good news.  Yeah, there was always like phone calls and stuff, and we'd have meetings, and there was 
[01:19:00]  always like the hope that we were getting back on the air pretty quickly.  And then as time went on, and the story faded from the news, and Bob's calls became less  frequent as far as, you know, prospects for getting back on the air, you just kind  of realized, oh, shit, you know, we're in this for the long haul.  We are not getting on the air anytime soon, and just, you got to start doing something  else. 
[01:19:30]  Thank God you didn't have a five-year deal.  Oh, my God.  Could have been worse, man.  I guess.  I think they'd have held us to five.  Yeah.  Well, it was such a big story that everybody was scrambling to get radio DJs to talk about  us, and pretty much most of these guys had no clue what we were about, what we did.  Most of them never heard our radio show, but they were experts, nonetheless.  We start with Sean Hannity, who had Man Cow on. 
[01:20:00]  Ugh.  Man Cow.  One of the biggest hypocrites in the radio business.  One of the biggest cocks, hypocrites in the business.  Another lying sack of shit on the air.  Let me make this perfectly clear.  I have never talked to Man Cow in my life.  Never.  Never.  We share the same agent, unfortunately.  That's about as close as it gets.  I've never spoken to him.  Never seen him in person. 
[01:20:30]  Never.  Never.  Never.  He's a lying sack of shit.  And after we got fired, he hated us so much in our radio show that he attempted to hire  a lot of the guys that worked for us behind the scenes.  Yeah.  So he's another fucking lying sack of shit, hypocrite, dishonest radio douchebag.  Now he's trying to go legit or something?  Yeah.  And he's denouncing all the stuff he did that made him semi-famous?  He's denouncing it as producers came up with it and his PD made him do these things? 
[01:21:00]  Right.  Cop out.  What a liar.  Shut up.  Yeah, because the environment and radio changed so drastically, now he doesn't want to acknowledge  all the stuff he did in the past.  Yeah, so he's saying other people came up with it.  He was forced to do all the shocking stuff, and now he's trying to turn around and be some  kind of a political guy.  I don't even know what he's going for, but it's failing miserably.  The guy just doesn't have the credibility or actual intelligence to discuss things like  Hannity is a smart guy.  And you know our stupid company, our ex-company there, they're going to hire him to take over 
[01:21:30]  for Howard in a few markets?  Oh, good luck.  Have fun.  Boy, if that isn't a disaster in the making.  Stern fans cannot stand this guy, and he doesn't have the juice to back it up and turn him around.  Ain't going to happen.  Infinity, but they're awful, and they're so unprepared for Howard leaving.  There's nobody really to put in that play.  All they're doing is they might as well just send out serious flyers.  They are doing such a shitty job of covering those markets.  All right, so here we go. 
[01:22:00]  Without further ado, Hannity talking to Man Cow.  And I also want to talk about how far is too far on radio.  We have the situation in New York with two guys, Opie and Anthony.  We share the same agent.  Now, I studied to be a minister.  You know this.  I studied to be a minister.  And I couldn't believe the company.  Look, it's had a devastating effect on radio.  The fact is it's had a devastating effect on adult male radio.  It's affected everybody.  But on a personal level, what monsters?  Sex and a church.  My God.  Shock Radio. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony.  Now, they were very talented.  They did very well in New York.  And you can't dispute their success.  Yeah, I really can.  I love Sean Hannity because whether you agree or disagree with his show, this guy is a very honest broadcaster.  I didn't realize that he was a fan of ours way back then.  I had no idea.  I thought he became a recent fan of the radio program.  But he obviously was listening enough to know that we did a lot more than the shocking stuff.  And we were funny and entertaining.  And as he said, very talented. 
[01:23:00]  He's a smart guy who backs up what he's saying with research and facts.  The guy doesn't just jump like all these other radio people with lines of bullshit that just because they say it, it's got to be true.  Like Mankow.  Right now, Hannity's going, you can't dispute their success.  And he said their success.  In New York, they're very successful.  Whether he researched our other markets, I don't know.  But in Philly, Boston, we were very successful.  And now Mankow is going to try to dispute that? 
[01:23:30]  That is fact.  It is written in Arbitron ratings.  It is written in stadiums full of people that came to our appearances and our softball games and stuff.  It's fact.  And now this asshole Mankow is going to try to dispute it.  You can't dispute their success.  Yeah, I really can.  They weren't.  No, no.  I was up against them.  I'm telling you, they had good ratings.  Look, we have the same agent, a guy named Bob Eatman out of L.A.  I don't think so.  I really don't think so.  But I read their ratings. 
[01:24:00]  I'm telling you, they did well.  Well, okay, great.  You know what?  Hey, the Christians and the Lions sold out every night.  That's easy.  What they did was easy.  Sex in a church is easy and it's evil.  I don't want to get into that.  You brought it up.  But should they be off the radio?  Well, you know, it's a tough call for me because in a free society, we have to have everything, don't we?  And you don't have to listen to Sean Hannity or Mancow Muller.  That's right.  Or Opie and Anthony.  My personal taste, I'm fine with them back under the rock from where they came.  But should they have a right to do it in a free society? 
[01:24:30]  Yes.  Hell.  What a douche.  What a complete asshole.  Man-cock.  So you don't like to be compared with, quote, shock radio hosts?  No, because shock is shock for the sake of shock.  It's, I'm going to kill a Girl Scout to get attention.  I have always, look.  Yeah, of course.  That's a great example, you ass.  This guy did his share of shock radio.  He's going to make believe he never did any shock radio stuff? 
[01:25:00]  He was known as a shock jock.  Stop it.  He's going to make believe he didn't stop traffic on a bridge to get a haircut or whatever he did?  Like that was his big thing.  Yeah, he stopped traffic on a bridge.  That's done just to be shocking and get your name in the paper, you ass.  Shocking.  You had a friggin' stunt guy named Turd on your show.  Ugh.  That went out and did wacky things.  Just shocking things.  Stop it.  You fucking idiot.  So you don't like to be compared with, quote, shock radio hosts? 
[01:25:30]  No, because shock is shock for the sake of shock.  It's, it's, uh, I'm going to kill a Girl Scout to get attention.  I have, man, I'm telling you, look at the TV, look at these happy phones.  But do you, but wait a minute, do you worry when, when you're attracting men 18 to 34, wait a minute, and you're doing all your sex stuff when you do it on the radio, are you concerned kids have the ability to listen to mankind?  I don't do that much, no.  Yes, of course I'm concerned.  I don't want children to listen.  Uh, and I tell parents, when, when they tell me, oh, my family listens, I say, you know what, you're a bad parent. 
[01:26:00]  It is, there's a hundred different radio choices in Chicago.  My idea of shock is talking about how Clinton was a rapist, uh, sticking, having Juanita Broderick on.  That, that kind of a thing that got me labeled as a shock jock.  Makes my blood boil.  Another dishonest guy.  And he's on Hannity, so he's got to say, my idea of being a shock jock, and he's got to bring up something political.  Because he's on Hannity. 
[01:26:30]  These guys are just a bunch of opportunists.  Obviously we're going back three years, but it still, it pisses us off when we hear this type of thing.  You know how many times Anthony and I have been called when another shock jock or, or edgy DJ does something stupid and gets fired?  They want us on TV immediately.  We've turned every single one of them down.  Yeah.  You're not going to see us going on TV to comment about another radio guy's firing.  It's not our gig, man.  It's not our, it's not the thing we do.  But these guys are desperate for attention, so, you know, had any calls in there? 
[01:27:00]  Sure.  When?  Oh, my God.  Yes, of course I will.  Anything to get my face on TV.  Mancow's never, never gotten over the fact that he can't succeed in New York.  He can't fucking do it.  It's the number one radio market.  For people out there in Radioland, if you're in radio, your goal is to get to New York.  That's your fucking goal.  And he's never been able to do it.  He's never been successful. 
[01:27:30]  He can't do it.  And that's always killed him.  And we come out of Boston on fire and get a gig in New York.  Huge station.  New York City.  He's never gotten over that.  He is a jealous fucking prick that has never gotten over that.  And he's done nothing but envy what we have done.  Always will bash us because of that, because of his own failure. 
[01:28:00]  Radio stunts turn bad.  The party is over for Opie and Anthony, as we've been discussing.  Radio show canceled after that sex stunt in St. Patrick's Cathedral.  And now that the plug has been pulled, will we be seeing kinder and gentler shock jocks?  Joining us now from Chicago, nationally syndicated radio talk show host, Mancow.  The opportunist.  The opportunist.  Just making the rounds.  He was on for a week straight because of us.  What a dick.  On a week straight. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  And he says he doesn't do that shocking type of radio.  He completely took our Whip Him Out Wednesday thing and made it his own for a while there  in Chicago.  Didn't you, Mancow?  What about that one?  Shocking.  That's pretty shocking to have girls flashing on our drivers if they have a wow sticker on  their car.  Did you or did you not take that bit and try to make it your own, you ass?  So, Mancow, was this like a shot across the bow of radio everywhere?  What do you mean by that?  What do you mean by that?  You know, guys all over the country who looked up to Opie and Anthony, are they chastened now? 
[01:29:00]  You know, I don't think anybody looked up to Opie and Anthony.  I've got to be honest with you.  I think it's...  Oh, stop already.  Just stop.  And when you have to say I've got to be honest with you, that means you know what you're saying  is full of shit.  Just stop.  You know, I'm...  If you study speech or any of that or communications in general, if you have to say to be honest  with you, that means you really don't believe the crap you're about to spew.  Here's the deal.  I am probably one of the most I don't think I'm successful guys ever. 
[01:29:30]  Like, I'm not the pat myself on the back, talk myself up guy.  I'm mostly the type of guy that kind of sees where I'm at and goes, gee, I hope this lasts  long, you know, because I'm such a fucking self-deprecating ass that I am.  But even with that mindset, I know we were successful at what we were doing at that time.  Abso-fucking-lutely. 
[01:30:00]  For man-cow to go on these shows, and the guy doesn't even realize, hold the phone a minute  here, man-cunt.  You're fucking...  You're on shows all week long that are talking about us.  If we weren't successful and doing well in the business, the news wouldn't even be covering  this fucking story.  So stop it.  You're lying.  It's another one of these guys that are trying to play it off like we were nothing and that...  It's just not the case. 
[01:30:30]  We were doing very, very well.  And that's the only reason you're on these shows talking about it.  Anthony, are they chastened now?  You know, I don't think anybody looked up to Opie and Anthony.  I gotta be honest with you.  I think it's like...  We heard from other shows all the time that they looked up to us.  Other shows coming up in the business.  We were their influence.  Look at the golden ticket thing you're talking about.  How many radio shows are responding to that? 
[01:31:00]  A lot.  He just...  I gotta be honest with you.  I think it's like, do other corporate guys look up to the Enron officials?  I think these guys were bad eggs.  Opie and Acne.  Not a fan.  Didn't like them as people.  And I think this is as easy as it gets.  Shocking.  Didn't like them as people.  Now, what is that based on, man, Cal?  The many times we hung out?  Yeah.  Are you bitter because our agent begged us to fly to Chicago to meet with you and you were  going to take us out to this big, huge steak dinner in Chicago? 
[01:31:30]  And we said, no, fuck that guy.  Because you wanted us to put in the good word with Infinity Broadcasting so you could get  in a real radio company?  Did that happen or not?  Did you not try to set that up with Bob to get us to fly to Chicago for a nice big steak  dinner?  A nice powwow where we get to know each other and then we would go back to New York and  we'd go to our bosses and go, you know, I think you guys should hire Man Cow on WNEW because 
[01:32:00]  they were looking for talk shows.  Did you not try to make that happen?  That's a lying.  A lying sack of shit.  Opportunist douchebag.  You don't like us as people.  What is that based on?  What is that based on?  There's not many people listening to this program right now that know what kind of person I  am outside this studio.  But you know, even though you never met me?  Never.  I think these guys were bad eggs, opium acne, not a fan, didn't like them as people.  And I think this is as easy as it gets.  And what scares me is the woman, you got that email, Karen from Michigan, you put that up. 
[01:32:30]  Let's get rid of all of them.  The fact is, you know, Dan Rather called what I have to say, hate radio.  They call Bill O'Reilly hate TV.  What I do is not shock radio.  I have an opinion.  It doesn't go along with the liberal media.  And so therefore I'm labeled a shock jock.  Look, I study being minister, John.  These people having sex in a church.  What does that even mean?  They're filthy.  They're animals.  And I don't like being lumped in with them.  And frankly, I don't think they should ever be allowed to work again.  Ha ha!  Ha ha! 
[01:33:00]  What does that mean?  Not only are we working again, we'll be much bigger than you.  I study to be a minister with your hack fucking radio voice.  I know a lot of people out there are like, dude, it's chill.  It's been three years.  No.  No.  No, we're not going to chill.  Our old company, they wanted us to.  We could have got out of the contract they were holding us to if we signed a little piece of paper that said,  we will never talk about Sex for Sam, and we will never talk about past or current employees of Infinity Broadcasting. 
[01:33:30]  It's a fact.  And if we did sign this paper, they would let us out of the contract earlier so we could get our radio careers back.  Anthony and I said, no fucking way.  Yeah.  This was a big fucking thing that happened to us in our careers and affected our lives.  If we have to sit so we get to finally talk about it and rip these guys a new ass that had all these dumb things to say about us,  then so be it.  We'll wait it out.  And then they said, well, if you do sign the paper and then you do start broadcasting somewhere else and you slip in, 
[01:34:00]  you mention Sex for Sam or you mention Howard Stern, we're going to fine you $100,000 per incident.  Guess what?  We said, no, we'll sit out.  What a tool.  You know, at one time or another, back in my ancient history, there were some fairly bright lines in radio that the FCC had painted.  They're not quite so bright anymore, or maybe after this they are.  I mean, look, I guess that whole sex in a church thing I had planned for Monday is done. 
[01:34:30]  You know, look, the line is very blurry.  I mean, guys have always complained about that.  I don't know what your experience was in radio, but the lines are something.  There's a lot of gray area.  But one thing I know, I mean, for God's sakes, let's just think about this as a human being.  You're in New York City, sex in a church.  I mean, the Catholic's a pretty big group in New York there.  Stupid.  It's just stupidity.  All right.  I'll give him that.  Poor man, Cal.  He didn't get the laugh there, though.  No.  That's why, you know, when guys talk that fast and they have to, you know, make sure there's no space in between everything they're saying. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, well, I love it.  Oh, with that voice, that hacky voice.  That's usually a person that is very insecure about what they're doing, and they don't want to stop because they don't want to see the reaction they're going to get for what they're saying.  You understand what I'm saying, Jimmy?  Certainly do.  You know, if you study speech and communications, I mean, you can learn all this stuff.  People that have to fill up all the air and leave no spaces are very, very paranoid and worried that they're going to be looked the fool for what they say. 
[01:35:30]  Until Howie's listeners get a shot at this guy.  Man, oh, good luck.  Good luck, man, cunt.  Well, and what kind of blew me away about this deal was, as you know, on Fox and Friends in the last day or so, one of the guys that works here, also works on that former show, said they had been told, and they sent these people out to do the stunt, don't go in St. Patrick's. 
[01:36:00]  And when they called in, they said, we're at St. Patrick's, and these two guys said, go on in.  It just kind of makes you wonder, what were they thinking?  You know what they weren't thinking, and I mean, again, this is the problem with being lumped in with these guys.  You know, should we get rid of Rush on the radio?  Should we get rid of Sean Hannity?  All of these shows are being lumped in, and I just don't think.  What?  What is wrong with you?  Yeah, they're lumping in Rush and Sean Hannity.  See, this is what he's trying to do right here.  He's trying to put himself in the same category as Rush and Sean Hannity by saying, I don't want to be lumped in with those guys, and they're lumping us all in. 
[01:36:30]  Sean Hannity, Rush, no one is mistaking you for Sean Hannity, man, a cock.  No one.  You don't have what it takes to be an intelligent talk radio host.  He wants to be the next Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity. 
[01:37:00]  He so wants to.  Sorry, you fucked your credibility up already.  It's over, Johnny.  How are those ratings in L.A. there, man, Cal?  Ooh, how's that working out for you?  On that tiny little A.M. station.  That's pretty impressive, huh?  All of these shows are being lumped in, and I just don't think it's fair.  These guys are dirtbags.  I know these guys.  No, you don't.  By the way, and I, unfortunately, you know, if this does happen, they're going to look at my brothers, but this is a fact. 
[01:37:30]  One of my brothers, if he ever sees Man Cow, will beat the shit out of him because of what you're about to hear.  Will beat the shit out of Man Cow.  Not the coolest thing to say on a national talk show.  I understand that.  I know these guys.  But my brothers were so infuriated by what you're about to hear that one of them, because, I mean, you think I'm whacked?  There's a side of me that's whacked.  I openly admit it.  I have brothers that are way more whacked than me.  One of my brothers was looking online for a flight to Chicago just to beat him up because of this statement. 
[01:38:00]  Being lumped in, and I just don't think it's fair.  These guys are dirtbags.  I know these guys.  We have the same agent.  These guys are dirtbags.  I know these guys.  He's never met us.  We have the same agent.  He's never met us.  So he's just flat out lying through his teeth because he has to make up some good stuff for his TV appearance.  I know these guys.  We have the same agent.  That's the only thing I feel bad about. 
[01:38:30]  How do you know us?  Man Cow, how do you know us if we've never met?  How do you know us?  Know these guys.  How do you know us?  He doesn't.  More lying.  I don't want my guy to lose money over these two jag-offs as we would call them in Chicago.  You know, they're bad guys.  Say la vie.  Goodbye.  Don't lump everybody in with these idiots.  How do you know we're bad guys, man Cow?  How do you know we're bad guys?  He knows us personally.  The only time you wanted us to meet, we said no. 
[01:39:00]  And that's because we didn't get on the phone with you.  We said it through Bob.  We've never talked to you once in our lives.  He's scorned like a fucking little bitch.  Like a little bitch.  He's scorned.  Let's back up here a little bit.  Everybody has bosses.  And the FCC is the boss of the radio station owner.  And the owner is the boss of radio station management.  So what are managers saying today now that they've seen this can get so ugly?  Here's the thing.  I do want to bring up something very important. 
[01:39:30]  And it does relate to your question.  I don't believe that we need more government.  I mean, all of us have had to deal with the DMV or the post office.  It's a disaster.  I don't think this is a case of big government.  I hope not.  I hope there's not a witch hunt.  Because, you know, who will be next?  But I think the people have spoken.  I think it's community standards.  And the people of New York said enough is enough with these guys.  My conversation with my managers, they know I'm never going to have people having sex in a church.  I mean, listen to what we're saying.  Listen to the fact that we're debating this.  Is it so many years of Clinton that we even debate this? 
[01:40:00]  Because they had sex in a church, you're done.  You don't deserve to have the tool of radio anymore.  Goodbye.  See you later, losers.  Don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.  So I can't even believe we're debating this.  I'm going to put that one down.  And what are managers saying?  To me, they're saying nothing.  Because they know I would never do something so stupid.  I love hearing this stuff because everyone thought we were done for good.  Every single one of our fucking enemies.  You're not going to hear from those guys again. 
[01:40:30]  That's it.  They're done in the business.  It's really, now we're going to be bigger than ever, eventually.  They're done in the business.  We understand that.  It's growing every day, though.  You just watch what happens next.  Let's say hi to Wayne in Illinois.  Wayne, what's up?  Wayne, let's go.  Yes.  Hey.  I just want to comment on what kind of a douche this guy is.  You know, one of his skits was he had somebody shave somebody's ass and turd ate it.  I mean, what kind of a hypocrite is that?  Shaved someone's ass and his little sidekick turd ate it? 
[01:41:00]  Yes, exactly.  Yeah, and I'm not a shock jock.  What I like doing, I like being compared to Russ Limbaugh and Sean Hannity.  Not a shock jock.  Yeah.  Hey, shave that guy's ass and then turd, you eat it.  Oh, look, turd's eating it.  You shut up.  Punch it out, guys.  Thanks.  Bunch of hypocrites.  Oh, man, I'm disgusted.  That's a funny bit, too.  I like the idea of that.  Shaved his ass.  And have a guy eat it?  I would really laugh if someone did that. 
[01:41:30]  Especially if it was Steve's awful Lebanese ass.  Big furry mess.  Eric in Philly, what's up?  What's up, dude?  Hey.  Hey, happy belated birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  Hey, I don't know if you caught the episode, but Cat House on HBO, Man Cut was on there.  He was on with that big, fat fuck that owned the place.  Hey, he's my friend.  Dennis Hoff is my friend.  He's a good egg.  So he went on some show about a whorehouse?  Well, I'm studying to be a minister.  Yeah. 
[01:42:00]  But you're doing a show that's all about a whorehouse.  Oh, yeah.  He's Mr. Moral America now.  Punch it out.  There you go.  Because he's a liar.  He's trying to be a chameleon.  He's trying to change his colors because of the climate in radio.  And he can't do it.  He's incapable of doing it because he's stupid.  The guy wants to lump himself in with Hannity and Rush.  Stop.  Just stop it. 
[01:42:30]  Now, there's a time and place for everything.  And a couple found out today that St. Patrick's Cathedral ain't the place for sex.  Cops say the couple from Virginia were in the vestibule of the cathedral and were observed performing a sex act.  37-year-old Brian Florence and 35-year-old Loretta Lynn Harper were charged with public lewdness.  42-year-old Paul Mercurio was allegedly recording the act and was on the phone with the Opie and Anthony radio show.  He was charged with acting in concert.  The stunt didn't sit well with people outside of St. Patrick's Cathedral.  That's crazy. 
[01:43:00]  Not in the church.  In the church, that's kind of bad.  Other public places, whatever you want to do.  But in the church, that's a little off.  I don't know.  Archdiocese spokesman Joseph Zwilling agreed.  His only comment was that it was, quote, disgusting.  Terry Sheridan, 10-10 wins at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  10-10 wins.  You know that it would take all week to play all the audio from news broadcasts,  and we'd still only be just touching the surface there?  Yeah.  So there you have it.  We made the news in other countries. 
[01:43:30]  The only word you recognize, or the only words you recognize are Opie and Anthony.  Because it's such a famous cathedral in New York.  You guys picked one to fuck up, and you certainly picked the cream of the crop.  Yeah.  This week, a couple was arrested for having sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York.  It's part of a radio contest put on by two local DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Hey, they sound wacky.  You know, I saw a picture of these two people who bonked,  and all I can say is they've got bodies built to fuck on radio. 
[01:44:00]  I mean, what's next?  Getting a rim job on the Jefferson Memorial?  Yeah.  Okay.  Wheezy, of course, not George.  And, uh...  I mean, where do we go from here?  Turning tricks on the police scanner?  Cunnilingus with semaphore flags?  I mean, seriously.  What?  What's the world coming to when people are illicitly fucking in church? 
[01:44:30]  That is a privilege reserved solely for priests.  No.  There you go.  What's a semaphore flag?  I would assume it's part of the way they communicate on ships with those flags.  You know, the different symbols on them?  Because they said on a police scanner, and then the semaphore flags.  He's got to throw in some obscure reference every time.  Yeah.  Some far flag. 
[01:45:00]  Well, we're having fun today.  It's a look back.  It was three years ago today that we did our Sex for Sam thing,  and we're getting into some old business, finally.  Hope you're enjoying or at least bearing with us today.  And what gets me more fucking ticked off than the whole St. Pat's thing  is listening to that asshole man cow.  That lion bag of shit.  He was one of many, though, bro.  One of many.  I haven't said bro in many years. 
[01:45:30]  Yes, you did.  Peter Jennings.  Peter Jennings.  Not only did you say it, but he killed himself right after.  Good luck, bro.  Yeah, but I don't say it a lot on the radio anymore.  Let's say hi to Nick the Brit.  Nick, what's up, buddy?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey, Nick.  Good morning.  Good morning.  How are you?  Top of the morning to you.  Yes, and the bottom of the rest of the day to you.  All right.  First class.  Underweight.  Yeah, I was over in London.  The lifestyles of the Roots and Farmers. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, right.  I don't know.  Actually, that guy, no one's ever heard of him over in England.  Really?  Really, yeah.  Anyway, I was over in London at the time when this story broke.  You guys made the news headlines there as well.  Really?  Really?  Just confirming what Mr. Jim Norton was about to say there.  See, that's what would be really fun because, you know, we got hundreds and hundreds of news clips from America, but if we could get some of the ones from London and other countries, how funny would that be with the bad accents and stuff? 
[01:46:30]  Well, the accents we're not used to.  The bad accents.  We're this ugly American guy.  Hey, gentlemen, I haven't got an accent.  I've got a voice.  I got the accent after I got off the plane.  Yeah, right on.  Right.  Yeah, right, right, right.  But I've got to tell you, though, that when I first started listening to you guys here on XM, my antibodies were quite strong, and I had a tolerance level for about, to start with about 10, 15 minutes, but you've got me. 
[01:47:00]  You've got me.  Those antibodies are found.  I've got the virus.  Don't call me dim no more.  Ah, officer, call me.  All right, thank you, Nick.  It's Nick.  Oh, Mitch?  Ready for love.  And then the lyrics change, and he's still going, ready for love.  Ready for love.  A pitiful rookerful.  A pitiful rookerful each.  The shiny stuff, the ice, the big, big money. 
[01:47:30]  Ah, there was a great instant feedback.  A little child.  Someone's sticking up for Anthony.  Anthony.  Oh?  Well, it's like, it's always Opie and something.  Oh, I know.  Opie and Dopey.  It's like, why does Anthony always get the short end of the stick with the...  It's got to be Opie so you can identify what they're trying to talk about.  But then I could get the slam.  Right.  It's always my name second.  But nothing rhymes with Anthony either.  Yeah.  You know what I mean? 
[01:48:00]  Schmanthony.  Yeah.  But that really doesn't work very well.  Believe me, if your real name was Fumbel, if it was the Opie and Fumbel show...  Oh, no.  We should just change the name of the show so we throw them all off.  Yeah.  Oranges and xylophone.  What?  Can't rhyme anything.  Let's go to Chris in Minnesota.  Chris, what's up?  Hey!  Hey!  First of all, you know, I just bought my XM satellite radio, man, and you guys fucking  kick ass. 
[01:48:30]  We don't give a shit!  That's right, you don't.  Well, anyways, the semaphore flags, yeah, I was in the Navy myself and used them.  They're used for communicating between ships visually.  You put them in different positions to spell out different words.  Right.  You know, I had a feeling that was what it was after Anthony said it.  But this is what Anthony does, because he doesn't want to embarrass fucking the two other  dummies he's in the studio with.  And he's, like, humble.  He goes, you know, I think what it is is that when it's, it could be, it's like, you're 
[01:49:00]  not yanking that out of thin air.  You're not guessing it's a communication between ships.  You know that.  But he's a nice guy, and he's, like, trying to go, like, you know, gee whiz, guys, we're  all kind of guessing.  Here's my stamp in the dark.  He gives us the chance to kind of nod along, like, yeah, you know what?  I think you're right, Anthony.  Like, the three of us are kind of coming up with this concerted effort.  We're all in this together, you know?  I think if, you know, help me out, guys, if I'm mistaken.  But he knows.  Yeah.  And then he gets the nice nod back from us, and we all feel good about ourselves, but  we're on to your fucking clever rule. 
[01:49:30]  Because if one of us had said, no, it's not, he would have went, well, you know, you might  want to rethink that.  It's awful.  It's like fucking, it's like doing radio with one of your parents.  He's always talking to you, like, nah, you're doing good.  Two fucking dopes we are.  That makes me feel terrible.  And when Anthony goes down that path, Jimmy and I just take a look at each other, like,  oh, here he goes again.  More info we have no fucking idea about.  Is that what a semaphore flag is?  It's good.  That's exactly what I would have guessed if you gave me 500.  Oh, yeah.  Boat communications.  Forget Aristotle. 
[01:50:00]  The fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  Oh, is that classic?  Something like, I think.  But how would they communicate?  I think, but helping out guys on this.  Yeah, and then we say something like, yeah, when they're in the water together.  And you go, yeah, yeah, that's when the boats are in the water together.  If you listen really closely, you'll hear Jimmy and I try to be part of that.  Like, yeah, yeah, you know.  But it's so not believable.  Jimmy.  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.  That's how we contribute with those fucking, what are they from? 
[01:50:30]  The Sesame Street thing?  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.  He comes up with the calculations and we just, yes, I'm to death.  But his math stinks.  But you're right.  But it wouldn't matter what he said right there.  We would have agreed.  If Anthony would have taken his SATs, he would have had like 700 verbal and like 50 in math.  50 in math.  Let's go.  I'm just not good in percentages.  Let's go to Staten Island.  Jimmy.  Yo, yo.  Oh, hey, Jimmy.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Jimmy, good morning.  Jimmy Miller is the fucking worst because I remember when he did Monday Night Football and 
[01:51:00]  one time he was calling a play and he said it remained him.  Yeah, babe.  Look at him.  Just cut through there like the sword of Damocles.  You think a fucking inbred watching Monday Night Football doesn't understand what the sword  of Damocles is?  It was cute in the beginning and then it got to a point where he just wanted to just get  as obscure as humanly possible.  All right, Jimmy.  Thank you.  All right.  Well, we're going to take another break here.  As we go to break.  Remember that phenomenal thing that that listener came up with? 
[01:51:30]  No one's helping us out in studio today.  So, I mean, I can't find it myself or we'd play it now.  Do you have it in there maybe?  I found another phenomenal clip too.  I was listening to my geezer interview and there's one in there too, which we'll have to  isolate.  What a fucking boob I am.  Well, Matt from South Jersey came up with that.  I think people have heard it by now.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, Matt has picked up on the fact that we all have crutches.  They're called crutches in the business, Opie.  And Jimmy loves to say phenomenal a lot. 
[01:52:00]  And now Matt from South Jersey is pointing out the fact that I like to say classic a lot.  Really?  Oh my God.  It's to the point every time I say classic, I go like this.  Oh, you wince.  I do a, yeah, I cringe to myself like, oh, another classic.  So Matt came up with this.  Classic.  Classic. 
[01:52:30]  Classic.  I used to have a crush on Candace Cameron back when I was in fifth grade.  So, so far he had his girlfriend on the line and she had the big orgasm for him.  And then he's now hitting on this chick and his girlfriend's still on hold.  This guy's a classic.  Classic.  Classic. 
[01:53:00]  You guys want to get Francine in here to do the news or what?  That's what she's here for.  Francine's a classic.  She's a classic.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Let's see how this comes out.  They have the paper towels.  All right.  They're right there.  All right.  Here we go.  I got a spring.  Ah, this is nice.  This is a story about a man, and he always was so lonely at night, but his voice was rowdy, you could hear it all through his train station, and I'm gonna sing this one, this is about Tippy Toe Tommy. 
[01:53:30]  Let's go, while we're young, while we're young.  You laid that night, and I have nowhere to go. 
[01:54:00]  Our money's gone and off for all my friends.  And the cop says to me, hey, you smell bad, get out of here.  And he says, and you know I have an angel, and he says, bad angel.  Shelter me from the falling rain. 
[01:54:30]  You have bombs.  This is my life.  I'm living with so much pain.  That's just a little piece. 
[01:55:00]  Ah, yes.  There's a song you can hear on Ethel.  Ethel, my favorite station on XM. 
[01:55:30]  Dandy Warhol, smoke it.  Loving the Ethel.  Loving the Ethel.  Ethel.  I got a text message during the break, Anthony.  Yes.  A location check from Elo.  He's down in D.C., and he wants to remind us that golf is alive and well.  The PGA channel.  Channel.  Uh-oh.  What channel?  Channel, I'm going to go with channel 46.  I'm totally guessing. 
[01:56:00]  It's either 46 or, or, or 2-0.  Uh, I couldn't tell you.  I think it's, I think it's 46.  I'm not positive.  Within 50 channels one way or the other.  Well, we had unbelievable storms that came through, so they had a postponed play at the PGA thing.  Yes, they did.  The PGA tournament, so they picked up coverage this morning at 8.  So if, uh, you're listening to us live and you're bored with us, you know, we don't care because it's not Arbitron stuff anymore.  No.  Go to the Golf Channel for a while and see who wins the PGA championship, okay? 
[01:56:30]  Right.  I think it's, uh, 46, but I'm not positive.  Golf.  About the L.  All right.  What else is going on today?  We got Tony Raimondo coming in from Sync Magazine.  He's always a lot of fun.  You sure he's coming in, or is he canceling, too?  He's going to talk about gadgets.  He's the, uh, editor of Sync Magazine.  America's Gadget Guide, Sync Magazine.  And what the hell are we going to ask Cal Ripken?  He's calling in in about, uh, an hour.  Oh.  Any questions for Cal?  I only have one so far.  What do you got? 
[01:57:00]  Uh, I'm just going to ask him about, uh, something along the lines of how him and Cy Young have the only records I think will remain unbroken forever.  Oh.  Which I firmly believe Cy Young's will never be broken, and I don't think Ripken's will either.  Could ask him about the steroid controversy.  Could ask him about, um, let me think.  What else?  Oh, you know what?  Sorry.  Golf is on 146.  Wait, isn't 46 my favorite station, Ethel? 
[01:57:30]  46?  What channel's 46?  Is it Ethel?  I don't know.  47 is squids, right?  I have no idea.  46.  Travis is, no.  Travis is just shaking his head.  No, no.  What's 46 now?  You're giving out all the wrong numbers.  All right, let's start with this.  Golf is now on, as we speak, if you're listening to us live, on 146.  Uh-huh.  All right, because we have PGA Golf now on XM.  46 is Top Tracks.  Thank you, Ben.  47 is Ethel.  And 48 is Squiz, I believe.  Okay. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, man.  Way to go, Ope.  What about this website you guys were talking about during the break?  One of the listeners sent me a link to my favorite new website.  It's called pervertedjustice.com.  Yeah.  Dash in between perverted and justice.  Now, what these guys do is they pose as kids, 13-year-old boys, 13-year-old girls.  They go into these kids' chat rooms, and they wait for older gentlemen to contact them.  Wait for the predators.  To come in and say hello, and what they do is they save the entire chat. 
[01:58:30]  They try to get the predator to send a photo of himself and his home information, his phone number, and these guys do.  And a lot of them are cautious, and they save the entire chat, and they put it on a website with the guy's photo and his home phone number, and they send it to his job.  It is fucking great.  And they just hang these guys out, man, and I was tooling through the site last night.  Really, really funny how they just nail some of these guys. 
[01:59:00]  Sometimes they leave the end of the transcript, and they leave it open for, I guess, a future venture, and sometimes the jig is up.  They just say, what are you doing trying to fuck a 13-year-old, and then the person starts backpedaling.  Hey, I was just chatting here, flirting, and then they'll say, well, remember when you said, you know, can I stick it in your ass?  That's flirting.  It's supposed to be a 13-year-old, you fucking pervert.  I have your picture, your phone number, your address. 
[01:59:30]  It's all going up on this website that we have.  We're contacting your boss, and it really, really nails these people.  Can we get somebody in here to, like, get the computer so they can click it on so we can get it?  I know Eric's busy.  He's isolating clips and stuff.  Is there somebody that can do that?  One of the funniest things I saw on this site, though, last night was they have a top five sleazers.  You can vote on how sleazy each of these guys are, and they have a top five.  But I went to the top ten, and number seven, the guy that came in at number seven. 
[02:00:00]  You don't have it on your computer?  No, I'll pop it up.  All right, go ahead.  The guy that came in at number seven, they have a picture of him, and they're all these bad sitting at their computer because it's a webcam.  That's how they get them to send the pictures.  It's him sitting there with a Sirius hat on.  Sirius doggy logo on the phone.  No, are you serious?  He's number seven out of all of them, and he's wearing a Sirius hat.  That's some good advertising for your company.  Isn't that great? 
[02:00:30]  Wow.  That should be the new logo for that company, Sirius, when your wife's pussy isn't enough.  Are you serious?  When I saw that, I was like, oh, you're kidding me, man.  Oh, that's funny.  That's how he gets little kids into the house.  He's like, do you want to just pet my hat?  Pet the hat.  I believe he's, what's his name?  Oh, let's make sure we get this up on opianthony.com because I'm sure this is something that the little doggy company doesn't want out there.  You got number seven? 
[02:01:00]  Wow, we must have a lot of listeners.  Yeah, they just jammed up the website.  Why did you have to say the URL, Anthony?  We announced the website.  That's why I know this show's growing, by the way, because in the beginning, we would mention websites, and we could still go to them and click on all the links and download huge video files.  No problem.  Now you just mention the damn thing, and we're done.  We're done.  My computer's jammed over here, too.  Mine says unable to connect.  Oh, man, rash, the pervert site.  The people at that site, though, they put a disclaimer, we don't condone harassment, and obviously this show doesn't condone harassment either, but I just think it's great that they do post the information of these people and their photos, and there's a great six-part news thing there that they did that this perverted justice did where they actually rent a house. 
[02:01:30]  The news helped.  This is like a time where the media is actually doing their jobs, and they have these guys come over, and as they show up, they open the door, and there's a fucking reporter with a microphone sticking out.  Oh, no.  And a camera.  And they think they're going to meet a kid. 
[02:02:00]  A 14- or 13-year-old, these guys, they have the whole chat printed out, ready to go, so this old guy will show up, and the reporter goes, what are you doing here?  And the guy's like, and I wish I had the clip.  I sent Ben an email last night.  There was one guy who, this fucking guy is my hero, even though he's a pedophile, because he was so caught.  He goes, I'm just here to spread the word of the Lord.  Oh, no.  And this motherfucker was so busted, he went to his car and started going door-to-door and handing out Bibles and talking Bible talk because he was so caught, he had to act it out. 
[02:02:30]  And the camera shows him on another porch trying to spread the word of the Lord to another.  Wow.  I was like, you have to love this guy.  He's just so trying to get out of this.  Yes, trying to just snake out of it.  Oh, he was so busted.  He's like, yes, I'm just here to spread the word of God.  They're like, well, we have this chat printed out with your picture on it.  He's like, I don't know about that.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Praise the Lord.  There was a guy, I was reading one of the transcripts last night, and I thought he was talking to a 13-year-old girl. 
[02:03:00]  His name was something like Yankee Dad.  It was really bad, like really bad.  And he's talking to what he thinks is a 13-year-old girl and says how he's getting all horny because of the conversation and that he wants to jerk off and would she like to see it.  And the camera goes on and there's pictures on the site where you click on him and he's just jacking it.  Oh, they show nudity?  I didn't see any of it.  You know what it is?  You scroll down and there's pictures, but then in the dialogue it'll say link, link, caution, nudity. 
[02:03:30]  Okay, okay.  And you click on the link and the last one is a money shot and it goes, here it is, a cum shot for a 13-year-old.  And there's all of it.  Holy crap.  And it's a picture of him with his cock out and on the top of the page is a picture of his smiling face like, hey, looking into the webcam.  And now it's all over the internet.  And what they do is this site's so cool because they actually have a girl that works for them because a lot of these guys think they're slick and they're like, all right, let's talk on the phone first. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, call me.  I mean, that's what I do with, you know, 18-year-olds.  But they have a fucking girl, actually, that will call and I guess she sounds young so now the guy feels like, all right, well, I really am talking to a young girl.  And it's so amazing because, like, they'll read the chat and then this really weird blue font, like italicized blue font, they editorialize a little bit.  Yeah.  This way you know that was not part of the chat.  Like, he'll say something like, you know, hey, do they pick on you at home?  And then they'll say, wow, this guy's a great groomer. 
[02:04:30]  Like, I guess grooming the kid.  Yeah.  Or one guy's like, hey, I really hope you're for real.  And they're like, he really hopes this is a 13-year-old child he's talking.  Yeah.  Oh, this site is fucking ruthless.  It's great.  I sent an email to them last night saying, you know, with the Opie and Anthony show on the subject heading, said we'd love to get you on and promote this site.  It's a great site because these predators, I mean, they're fucking kids.  They're just total scumbags.  And it's entertaining as hell to go to and read some of these.  Look at you trying to produce the radio show.  I like that, Jimmy. 
[02:05:00]  I like your initiative.  These are guys that are just, I mean, come on, we're perverts and we fuck with them.  But these are guys that just do something that is so, so savage and they're so against society.  They just, they prey on fucking weakness and they really should just be rounded up and executed.  But since you can't do that, you might as well humiliate them publicly.  Well, hopefully we'll get them on the show tomorrow or something.  Yeah.  I mean, they might not have gotten the email until, who knows, they might be West Coast based.  I'm not sure.  But it was so great to see that news report.  We got to get clips of that for later in the show or tomorrow. 
[02:05:30]  But they're so funny, some of these clips.  All right.  We'll work on that for tomorrow's show.  How's that?  Yeah.  I encourage people, pervertedjustice.com and definitely support these guys, man.  This is a great thing they're doing.  Well, they're supporting the website because we can't even do it.  We can't do anything with the website right now.  Yeah.  Just sitting there.  Check it out later if you want to.  Just sitting there.  Number seven, wearing his serious doggy hat.  Oh, this should be.  Really funny.  XM should have that as their webpage with the dialogue.  Well, we got to get that up on opianthony.com.  And you got to put the dialogue. 
[02:06:00]  It's hilarious.  I'd say it's hilarious even though it's, because I know he wasn't really talking to a kid.  I just know.  It's funny because you know that this motherfucker is being set up for a bust.  That's the way you can look at it.  Otherwise, you're going to want to throw up when you read it because it's like, this guy's  talking to a kid.  I mean, what a piece of shit.  Someone's saying that should be a Dee Dee's job to make the phone calls.  Yeah, absolutely.  She'd be perfect with a little kid voice.  Then they'll think it's Bobby from Howie Mandel's act in 1988.  That's what she sounds like.  Why haven't we had Dee Dee on lately?  I don't know. 
[02:06:30]  She called me to do something.  I forgot.  Well, you're like the new producer of the show, Jimmy.  Could you get that done for me?  No, no.  It was unrelated to this show thing.  It was actually about doing a gig somewhere.  All right.  We got more man-cow stuff, Anthony.  Eric is good.  He went out there.  This kid went to the computer, and he finds stuff.  This is the paper I shake.  Good job, Hawk.  Eric is working his ass off behind the scenes today.  Juicy young boy's ass.  We like to acknowledge when he's just sucking on mayonnaise packets.  Hi.  Is this Mayo Boy 141? 
[02:07:00]  So we should acknowledge when he's actually working his balls off, which he does on a regular  basis.  I bet you all Eric would say if somebody was trying to sexually abuse him online is he'd  be too shy, and he would just type in yepers.  Yepers.  New name for whackbag.com.  What are you wearing?  Yepers.  A little button-down shirt and an eight-year-old's cap.  That's right.  A sailor suit, sir.  Do you like white stuff on your face?  Funny you should say that.  I do. 
[02:07:30]  Squeeze it out of packets.  I think he's hit pay dirt, but it's just a 27-year-old.  How old are you now?  27.  27-year-old guy dressing like a little boy.  Because Eric's too shy to send his face, so he sends it from the neck down, and the  guy's like, are you sure you're nine?  Or will you be in two years?  Oh, my God.  Here it is, Anthony.  The wannabe pedo tried to solicit Marky, a 13-year-old boy, or so he thought, and there  he is sitting there giving the webcam his best pose with his Sirius satellite radio hat 
[02:08:00]  on.  Sirius hat.  Dude, we got to get some of these printed out.  We have to get some of these because they're so good.  I just thought, again, it was kind of late last night.  Can we get the top ten and just have them in the studio?  I would love to.  That would be hilarious.  Yeah.  Top ten scumbags in America.  We should maybe get some people in here to read a little bit of them, like the dialogue  back and forth.  Maybe, you know, Big A could play one guy and someone could play the other.  Because, again, it's a pedophile. 
[02:08:30]  Holy crap.  You're producing.  Dude, I'm going to have to give you two salaries.  You're producing and doing a fine job on air.  But you got to realize, too, that these are.  That's what we're looking for in a producer, to come up with this shit.  These are adults they're talking to.  And that's, to me, why there's some kind of comedic value to it.  Because you just know that this guy, with every filthy question he asks, he might as  just be going, shh, with a shovel and tossing dirt back over his shoulder.  Yep.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Big A has to play the part of the victim. 
[02:09:00]  And I think we should go with, you guys want to go with Paul?  Ooh.  Is that a good combination?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of the voices that we have at our disposal?  That is good.  All right.  Let's set that up.  We've got to get Paul in here with the Big A to read some of the transcripts.  What's the website again?  Pervertedjustice.com.  And there's a dash in between perverted and justice.  And thanks.  I've got to give credit where it's due.  Whichever listener out there sent me that link.  Thank you.  It was really great, man.  You know what would work well also is Big A as the perpetrator and someone like Didi with 
[02:09:30]  the voice like that because he's so creepy.  God damn it.  You're right.  With him doing all the, you know, I want to fuck you in the ass.  Yeah, that's good, too.  I think it works either way, but you're right.  I want to hear you.  Well, how about Steve as a perpetrator?  I just wanted to know, will you put your pants down so I can put my cock in your ass?  Actually, you know what?  If Martini Steve will play one of the roles, I think that would work. 
[02:10:00]  If Martini Steve, I think Steve sees mortgage payment and understands what happens is you're  a booted motherfucker.  Ramon, get me the puppy and drugs.  Because it'll be great because Steve will just be so annoyed trying to do the bit.  All right.  So it's Martini Steve and Big A.  Later this week, reading from these trans.  Pervertedjustice.com.  Okay.  Also, Didi.  All right.  Here we go.  So you pointed something out, backing up a little bit.  Mancow had to talk about us. 
[02:10:30]  It was three years ago today.  We did the Sex for Sam thing, blew up our radio careers.  We had to sit out two years and three months.  Yeah, that's right.  And then the satellite radio companies came a call in and we chose XM Satellite Radio over  the little doggy company and we couldn't be happier.  Right.  And we're going to be bigger than ever eventually.  We know that now.  So Mancow was on all these TV shows saying we're done, blah, blah, blah.  And you pointed out something during the break here, Jimmy.  Yeah.  It seemed like in the one, and I noticed there's only one hearing them back to back, but in  the one clip with Hannity, Hannity kind of pinned him and said, well, what about, should 
[02:11:00]  they be allowed to do this?  And he's going, yes, in a free society, yes, they should.  And then it seems like in the next clip, he's like, they should never work.  It was just an odd inconsistency to hear when you hit back to back.  Inconsistent?  Mancow?  Hmm.  Should they be off the radio?  Well, you know, it's a tough call for me because in a free society, we have to have everything,  don't we?  But should they have a right to do it in a free society?  Yes.  No.  All right.  And then?  These people having sex in a church, they're filthy, they're animals, and I don't like 
[02:11:30]  being lumped in with them.  And frankly, I don't think they should ever be allowed to work again.  Free society should be able to never work again.  Why?  With sex in a church, you're done.  You don't deserve to have the tool of radio anymore.  Goodbye.  What happened to the thing about free society?  I was studying to be a minister.  What happened there?  He didn't finish?  What happened with his studies?  I don't know.  What a dickbag. 
[02:12:00]  And he's trying to claim that he's not a shock jock, and he never did shock you.  I'm not a shock jock.  I don't like being lumped into that.  What I find shocking, and why I get pegged as being a shock jock, is because I bring  up Bill Clinton.  Oh, Bill Clinton, that's what made you a shock jock.  That's what gave you the label.  It wasn't this?  Thank you for calling the information center.  This is Cindy.  May I help you?  How you doing, Cindy?  Just fine.  You, uh, this is a tampon hotline?  Um, yes.  Okay, because I'm, uh, I got a problem here. 
[02:12:30]  Mm.  Mm-mm.  My wife got a little bit of a problem with one of these tampons.  Mm.  Can you help me?  I can.  I, uh, I can't get the cotton out of my teeth.  Mm.  What an ass.  Help.  Not only trying to do the shock jock thing.  Fake.  Also doing a fake phony fucking phone call.  Fake.  That was some of the worst acting I've ever heard.  What an ass.  He doesn't do shocking stuff, huh? 
[02:13:00]  Hello?  Yeah, Miss Hand?  Yes.  Hi.  Hi.  Are you the woman offering the job?  Uh, no.  And the man told me to call you.  Call me for what?  Something about a job.  Uh, no, this must be the wrong.  This is Hand.  Hmm.  This is the Hand's residence.  Yeah, I've been looking for a hand job.  Yeah.  No, there's, uh, nothing available.  This isn't the place to call for hand jobs?  No.  All right.  Goodbye.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  You don't lump me in with Hannity.  You will fly with me and live here. 
[02:13:30]  And since you cannot remember your name,  I will call you Bird Boy.  There you go.  Yeah.  A couple examples of him doing shock stuff.  Tampon in the mouth.  Hand job.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're right up there with, uh, Limbaugh.  Yeah, because that's exactly what Sean Hannity does on his show.  Jackass.  And Rush Limbaugh does.  Yeah.  Welcome to the Excellence in Broadcast Radio. 
[02:14:00]  Is this the Hand residence?  Shut up.  Right.  What an ass.  Wait, let me get you the music, Ant, just for a second here.  Because it's just so much fun to hear the music.  There we go.  Welcome back to the Rush Limbaugh program.  Excellence in Broadcasting.  Is this the Hand residence?  I am looking for a hand job. 
[02:14:30]  Please don't get me.  Don't lump me in with the likes of Opie and Anthony.  The most shocking thing I ever say is,  Bill Clinton is a rapist.  Now that I'm through with that.  Hello, bowling alley.  Do you have 10-pound balls?  How do you walk?  Please continue listening to the Rush Limbaugh program  on these stations that you listen to every day. 
[02:15:00]  Do you have Prince Albert in a can?  Will you best let him out?  He's suffocating.  What a dick bag.  Man ass.  Too good, too good, too good.  Well, everyone got to talk about us three years ago today. 
[02:15:30]  Got somebody else here that had a comment about our Sex for Sam thing and our demise.  People want me to comment on the firing of Opie and Anthony.  By the way.  Opie and Anthony.  Here he comes.  Look, we'll never deny his success and his talent.  You can't.  I don't think it's the same show as it was.  I don't think it's anywhere near how good it used to be.  But the funny part is, like, we went at it for years. 
[02:16:00]  Well, like two or three years.  And the guy refused to mention our names.  Right?  Yep.  Now that we couldn't defend ourselves and we were, you know, just at our houses and had  no forum, no radio show.  We weren't going to go on TV.  Now he was brave enough to mention our names for the first time.  Yeah, there it was.  There it was.  Because we were out of the mix now.  Right.  So, boy, real brave, Howard.  What about all those times we just made you look silly on our show when we were doing  afternoons for the same company and to have us shut up or fire us? 
[02:16:30]  Right.  When we made fun of your daughter, you didn't have the balls to say our names, did you?  But as soon as we were off the air and we couldn't defend ourselves, then it was easy  to say our names, right?  People want me to comment on the firing of Opie and Anthony.  Personally, I'd rather not talk about it, but I will since everybody's asking me what  my feeling on it.  Oh, this was a very happy day for Howard and the crew, by the way.  Oh, for everybody on radio.  Extremely happy day.  They were waiting for this day to happen. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  And it happened.  I'll talk about it.  I'll save that for later.  People also...  Is it a real firing?  Is it a real firing or a radio firing?  I don't know anymore.  I can't wait to get out of radio.  That's all I'll tell you about it.  I just can't wait to get out.  I got three years left and I'm gone.  He's got three years that he's gone.  So this happened three years ago.  Well, look at that.  I guess he's leaving broadcasting, isn't he? 
[02:17:30]  I guess he's leaving it.  Shut up.  I'm gone.  And I can't wait.  I'm sitting there.  It's so funny.  It would be, you know, the cloning of the Howard Stern show.  How many Howard...  I mean, the whole radio dial basically sounds like Howard Stern.  Tell him, Fred.  Go to 1010 Winds or any news station.  It sounds like Howard.  Go to anywhere.  Go to a rock station.  It's Howard.  Across the dial.  Everywhere.  Just Howard Stern clones is all you're going to get, Robin. 
[02:18:00]  That's right.  Oh, shut up.  Shut up.  Oh, my God.  He has just been doing this forever.  Enough already.  We get it.  Hoo-hoo, Robin.  Hoo-hoo, Robin.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo-hoo, Robin.  Robin.  Hoo-hoo-hoo, Robin.  Right, Robin?  Tell him, Fred.  Tell him, Fred.  I invented everything. 
[02:18:30]  Put a bandana on your car.  Sirius sucks ass.  And I thought those guys had the cushiest job in radio because they got handed every one  of my radio stations that I syndicated and worked so hard for.  Oh, yeah.  And they just handed it to somebody for the hell of it.  Right, Howard?  You fucking asshole.  They just, what?  They threw all their names in a hat and said, well, we'll pick out a name.  That's it.  And that show gets to be syndicated where Howard's syndicated.  That's what they did. 
[02:19:00]  And within a week, Mel just gave them every goddamn station on the dial.  Why don't you tell your listeners why Mel gave us all those stations, Howard?  Why don't you tell them the real story?  Why don't you tell them that Mel got word that we were going across the street to Clear Channel  to Q104.  To do mornings.  To do mornings right up against you.  Head to head for once.  Finally.  Finally.  The big radio battle that everyone wanted to see at the time.  Why don't you tell them?  Because we were doing afternoon.  Why don't you be honest with your listeners, Howard?  We were doing afternoon, so people were listening to Howard in the morning and us in the afternoon. 
[02:19:30]  We split a lot of the audience, is what happened.  And we were going to be pretty much the first show going head to head with Howard with a proven audience already in the market.  It's very hard to come swooping into a market, especially New York, out of nowhere, do mornings and beat Howard.  It wasn't going to happen.  But we had been there for years already cultivating an audience, the same audience he had.  A lot of people, it was a crossover audience.  So they were shitting their pants knowing that we were going to go to mornings. 
[02:20:00]  I remember our contract was ending, and Ken Stevens came to us, and he showed us the new number for the new contract.  And Anthony and I are like, what?  And Ken's like, look, this is our final offer.  This is the best we could do for you guys.  Final offer.  And this was after just bringing in huge ratings, huge, for afternoon drive in New York, okay?  So we're like, all right.  So within a day or two, our agent, Super Agent Bob Eatman, had a massive offer from Clear Channel to go do mornings.  Yep.  A massive offer to do mornings in New York City right up against Howard. 
[02:20:30]  Not only that, we'd be syndicated to a bunch of Howard's markets.  Yep.  Guess what Infinity did?  They came back and offered us, I'm embarrassed to say it, but I'll say it, about ten times more.  Ten times more.  Yeah.  The offer went up about ten times.  Because they were shitting a brick that we were going to go up against Howard.  And then Howard finally gets a chance to talk about it.  And he's like, oh, Mel just handed them the markets.  Yep.  Howard had his hand in that whole deal.  That's what they did. 
[02:21:00]  And in the end, a lot of people go, why didn't you go to Clear Channel?  They just didn't have their shit together, to be honest with you.  No.  So, you know, we got what we wanted to continue an afternoon drive where we had a huge loyal audience.  And we got to spread, like we like to call it, spread the virus to many other cities across America.  So to us, it was a win.  From every goddamn station on the dial, and they had afternoons, it was a cush job, and they blew it, and deservedly got fired.  Because, you know, even I know, as whacked out as I am, I know I can't encourage people to do something illegal. 
[02:21:30]  If once I do that, I'm gone.  There would have been a whole lapse in judgment because they had sponsors.  Listen to the whole, by the way.  This is my favorite part now.  You get to hear the whole contribute absolutely nothing.  The whole.  To a very deep discussion.  Lapse in judgment because they had sponsors for this illegal activity.  Yeah.  It was approved by the station.  Yeah, it was, yeah, but all of a sudden, but, you know. 
[02:22:00]  That's all she had.  That's all she had.  Facts that anyone could read in a stupid newspaper.  You know, all of a sudden, then it wasn't approved by the station.  So, you know.  How could you have sponsors if the station wasn't approved?  Something illegal sponsored by Pepsi.  I forget the sponsor, but they had to take out an, oh, it's Samuel Adams.  Samuel Adams Beer, one of our sponsors.  That's right.  They had an ad in a paper up in Boston.  Apologize.  Apologize.  She's actually saying what you guys would have said, which is this was a sponsored event 
[02:22:30]  and the station knew.  And the station knew about it, so where's the problem with us?  Yeah, why are you guys getting it all thrown at you when the company knew, obviously, and  the station knew and approved it?  What kills me about all these guys is that none of them have a good word to say about me.  They all grew up listening to me.  I did.  They all took the act.  They all took the act, and then they want to get on the air and badmouth me and talk  about it.  Because that's part of the act.  Yeah, because that's what you do. 
[02:23:00]  That's what I did with Ima, so you know what I mean?  It's part of the whole album.  That's right.  You've got to hate everybody.  How about the fact that...  You've got to hate everybody, Howard.  We're not stupid.  I grew up listening to Howard, of course.  I grew up on Long Island in New York.  Of course you grew up listening to Howard.  The respect was absolutely there doing radio.  Especially coming into New York.  Like I said before, he likes to ignore that part of it, because when we were doing afternoon  drive, we did give him his boss, but then we started calling him out on all his ridiculous 
[02:23:30]  things that he did.  Hypocrisy.  Hypocrisy.  You come into New York, especially listening to Howard growing up and then getting into radio,  you knew you didn't come into his city and badmouth him.  It was counterproductive.  His fans aren't going to give a shit who you are.  You don't come swooping in and badmouth the guy.  And before we knew him personally, well, not personally, because I don't want to sound  like man douche, you know, I sat down and talked to Howard Stern, but there have been  a lot of things that happened where he went to Mel Karmazin and other infinity executives 
[02:24:00]  and had us shut down.  Had us to shut up about certain things.  And that stuff, that hypocrisy had to be pointed out.  And that's what we pointed out.  And the way he responded to it, that's why we started badmouthing him.  When we first came into New York, we had nothing but good things to say about the guy.  What were you going to say bad?  The guy did great things in radio.  How were you going to badmouth him?  Plus the fact that we were working for the same company.  So we acknowledged what he did in radio.  And he never did anything to us.  So fuck it.  And then we started doing our own thing.  And he didn't like the fact that we were building an audience. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  Right in his backyard with the same company.  Yep.  Getting a big time buzz.  So it wasn't like we just came in and badmouthed Howard for the sake of badmouthing him because  he badmouthed Imus?  No.  You gave us reason to badmouth you because you were being a dick.  And you cried to the bosses.  You were worse than the way he portrays Imus in private parts.  He's ten times worse than Imus ever was to him.  Ever.  Stop.  The loser of the week during the Opie and Anthony firing had to be Jay Moore, a comedian 
[02:25:00]  who used to, as you reminded me, used to stand on line to get in the door here to try  to be on my show.  He used to hang around hoping we'd notice him.  But those guys put him on.  So then all of a sudden he's giving interviews, how bad I suck.  And when he turns on the E! show, all he sees is naked women.  But those guys got fired for naked women.  You're having sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral.  It's like, I said, it's like literally Attack of the Clones.  What? 
[02:25:30]  I'm just too busy listening to the whole.  She has absolutely nothing.  What was he getting at, though?  Attack of the Clones.  Well, we're all clones of him.  But what was he getting at?  Like, how were we clones?  Sex in St. Pat's, naked women on E!  I don't know what he's saying.  I don't know.  He's trying to claim that no one did naked women on the radio before him.  And it's just not true.  No one did anything.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot.  I forgot, Anthony.  No one did anything. 
[02:26:00]  Well, what killed me was Opie and Anthony were working for this company.  And they came here, their whole act was bad-mouthing me.  And I went, wait a second.  Aren't you the two guys who came down here for the Jackie Martling song parody contest?  And aren't you kind of the same age as me?  They were like 42.  It took you 40 years to figure out the image?  You know, I mean.  Wow.  I don't even have to explain that.  We prove over and over again that he just lies through his teeth.  42.  The fact is we're about 10 years younger than him.  Jesus.  I don't know his exact age. 
[02:26:30]  I don't know what age he's using these days.  No, I'm serious.  So it took you 40 years to figure out to imitate me?  I mean, you know, so anyway.  So they got fired.  And so on said to me, well, what do you think of the firing?  And I go, what's the difference?  They're just going to replace those guys with more clones.  They got more in the wings.  Who cares?  I just think they blew it.  They had a good deal going.  No one will hire them now.  Why?  Because bad judgment.  Dude, don't encourage.  All you have to do is not being illegal.  No one will hire us, huh?  Yeah, that's what it is. 
[02:27:00]  Really?  But it really doesn't impact me because, you know, what am I going to tell you?  I'm just dying to basically get off the air myself.  Remember, kids, this is three years ago.  Unless it's, you know, half a billion dollars.  Right.  Then I'm...  This guy doesn't have the desire to do radio anymore.  He didn't have the desire three years ago.  The air myself, the company hires anyone who sounds like me. 
[02:27:30]  I think that all of these guys...  They don't sound like you.  They bring them here and they say, please sound like him.  And all of the guys, I think, suffer from little man complex.  What I mean is, for now, until the time I leave radio, I will be the guy.  I'm the guy who started it all.  I've done it all.  There are guys who imitate me from 20 years ago.  There are guys who imitate me from 10 years ago.  There are guys who imitate me how I sound now.  I mean, it's just mind-blowing.  Who would imitate him now? 
[02:28:00]  Who's that lame show?  Like, why wouldn't you imitate him when he was good?  And who's going to be imitating who, by the way?  Yeah.  Who, who, Robin?  I believe you're following us now, Howard.  By the time you get on The Little Doggy Company, we've been doing this for over a year.  Yeah.  So who's following who now?  Are you really the pioneer of satellite radio, Howard?  And what was in the trades the other day about us being, the downloadable show? 
[02:28:30]  Oh, audible.com.  Audible.com.  And then it was mentioned in one of the trades, and it said, will Stern follow?  Yeah.  It said, Opie and Anthony available on audible.com for download.  Will Stern follow?  But he'll have invented that, too.  As long as he says it, it's got to be true.  The tides are changing.  Now he's following us.  Yeah.  In fact, an absolute fact.  We're a year into satellite radio already.  He hasn't been on it yet.  Who's, who's starting this? 
[02:29:00]  Who's the first high profile shock show?  Stop it.  And now you can download our show.  So you hear a show that's particularly good and you want it.  And you want it for your iPod or whatever you're using to download your stuff.  There you go.  Yeah.  For a slight price, you could get, you know, entire shows.  In early June, XM Satellite Radio and audible.com, the Internet's leading premium spoken audio source,  announced a multifaceted strategic relationship, part of which include XM content being delivered through the audible website. 
[02:29:30]  That agreement has come to fruition with Opie and Anthony and the Bob Edwards show.  You mean people can download Bob Edwards?  Stop mentioning us with Bob Edwards.  Now available at audible.com.  Oh, my God.  I just looked up.  Regis is playing drums with Tommy Lee.  What a douche.  Single episodes are available for $2.95, or there are monthly and annual subscription rate options.  In related news, is Sirius Satellite Radio looking to do something similar with Howard Stern once he arrives? 
[02:30:00]  Do you need a prescription to download the Bob Edwards show?  Is that what it is?  Like Vicodin?  Or something?  You can't just be allowed to download that and put it on an iPod.  You might be driving.  We just pound the guy over and over again.  And the fact is, the guy has never done anything to us.  No.  Nosferatu.  Every time he sees us, he's very nice and waves.  Of course he is.  And then goes and smokes his cigarettes.  That chain-smoking ghoul. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, Jesus.  He casts no reflection, and you have to invite him in your house.  His lungs must look like a dump in Rio.  And I'll always be the guy.  And if you've ever gone to the gym to work out, and you see a little tiny guy who's all pumped up.  Right.  Muscles are way too big.  Muscles are way too big because he's got to prove something.  That complex.  Most of these guys will self-destruct, especially if they can't talk about me.  You know what I mean?  It's just very frustrating. 
[02:31:00]  If they can't talk about me.  It's all about me.  Yeah.  Everybody.  See, he was so brave.  You know, he could talk about all these guys that were bothering him.  And he made sure these guys couldn't talk back.  And that's kind of like a weird slip.  The problem there is, you know, Anthony and I, in general, don't listen to people.  But in this case, we had to listen, or we wouldn't have a show.  And then what are we really proving?  But then they started to threaten Ken.  Like, all right, you guys can say what you want.  But then Ken's going to get the ax if he can't control you.  Yeah.  Now you're going to get your boss fired if you guys chime in. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  So he gets everyone to shut up as far as talking about him.  But then he's allowed to go on the air and talk about whoever he wants.  Yep.  And that was supposed to make sense.  That's how it worked.  But they were just so scared of Howard.  That's what they had to do.  At least Imus never ran to the boss and made you shut up, Howard.  Imus was able to take it.  The guy could dish it out and take it.  You, on the other hand, you dish it out your whole career.  And then the second somebody tries to give it back to you in an effective way, 
[02:32:00]  you run to Mel Karmazin, your daddy.  You run to daddy and start crying.  As far as those two guys go, I resented the fact that there was not a nice word coming from the camp.  I think that I had set up syndication.  I think I had set up a lot of nice opportunities.  You did not.  They gave us syndication because they were scared that we were going to go up against you, you lying fuck.  Wow.  These people just, can we get one guy? 
[02:32:30]  It's amazing what these guys could do on the air.  And their listeners have to believe it as fact because they're being told it by their hero.  Let me say it again.  And the reason we were syndicated to all those cities was because the company was scared we were going to Q104 here in New York to do mornings.  End of story.  I think I had set up a lot of nice opportunities within the company.  And it really was unnecessary to sit there and go through the Howard Stern clone attack of Howard Stern.  You know what I mean?  It's that bit irritating. 
[02:33:00]  They robbed you blind, those guys.  They did everything that you do.  Everybody robs me blind.  Everybody robs me blind.  That's your buddy, right?  Who?  Who was that?  That sounded like Gary.  Huh?  No, I was...  I don't mean to say that, actually.  I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said that.  Who do you think it was, Artie?  And go through the Howard Stern clone attack of Howard Stern, you know what I mean?  It's that bit irritating.  And they robbed you blind, those guys.  They did everything that you do.  Everybody robs me blind.  That ain't leaving?  No.  Okay. 
[02:33:30]  Absolutely not.  It might have been John.  Ah, you know what?  That might have been John.  Kind of sounded like him.  All right.  Yeah, definitely wasn't leaving.  Sorry about that.  It's fine.  I want to go out with some grace.  I don't want to be Imish.  I don't want to get too old and be mumbling into the goddamn microphone like some kind of freak from my ranch.  If I get a ranch, I won't ask the listeners to pay for it.  I'll buy my own ranch.  Thank you.  None of you are young men.  He is old at this point, so just get off it.  Because the guys who got fired were busy calling me old when they got here. 
[02:34:00]  And I'm reading the paper, Greg Cumia.  Come on, yeah.  Oh, wow.  That's really funny.  Oh, the Cumia joke.  I get it.  You're going to take my first name and Anthony's last name.  Oh, my name again with the last name.  You might want to rehire Jackie to write for you again.  She's not doing a good job on your own.  That's the best you can come up with.  Greg Cumia is 42.  And I'm going, wait a second.  How are you a young upstart? 
[02:34:30]  Who's Greg Cumia?  Oh, that's Opie.  Oh.  I never bothered to learn their names.  I don't know why.  Well, I learned it.  It was all over the newspaper.  Greg Cumia.  No.  Cumia.  Oh, by the way, I saw a picture of those guys.  Oh, my God.  Greg Cumia.  Come on, yeah.  They better stay on radio.  Oh, my God.  I was going to move to major motion pictures.  Right.  I've got to listen already.  Well, I've got to stay where I'm at. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, my God.  Lying about our ages.  Best I could come up with with our names.  Oh, my goodness.  What happened?  I don't know.  So, I have nothing.  I had nothing against them.  I had nothing.  I tried not to give it a second thought.  Yeah.  I'm completely irritated by the whole state of radio.  You lost sleep over us, Howard.  Depressing to me.  But that's it.  That's my comment.  I mean, I don't know what to say.  What can I say is I know that when you, if you, listen, if I got on the air and I said  to you today's kidnapping day and you do it, I'm responsible. 
[02:35:30]  You win.  Yeah, you win.  It's inciting a riot.  And that's what happens.  I mean, I don't know what to tell you.  Oh, that hole.  She has nothing.  She made some good points, though.  She made some salient points.  Yeah.  Because he said something and she went, yeah, and then laughed.  It was three years ago today.  That's why we're taking a look back.  Our enemies got involved.  Everyone had fun at our expense three years ago.  This is a little late, but Eric Logan checking in.  Just a reminder, pedophile-free programming, alive and well on XM Kids Channel 116. 
[02:36:00]  Well, they're actually giving the pedophiles their own channel.  Oh, really?  That's the new thing, yeah, to honor the Canadian excursion.  But it has to be Canadian pedophiles.  That's where all the pedophiles go.  Canada.  Yeah.  Wow.  Man.  Speaking of that hole, Robin, you know how we talk about the woman that just ruins every  radio show?  Yeah.  Excuse me.  We had Moya here in the Howard clips where she has absolutely nothing to add of substance 
[02:36:30]  except stuff that you could read in a paper.  Yeah.  Well, someone, I guess this is sassy, came up with this bit, isolating the typical female  on a radio show.  Right.  Just isolating what a female would be saying, as the guys are doing all the heavy lifting.  Guys doing heavy lifting, trying to get edgy, talking openly, and there's always that woman  in studio to keep everyone under control. 
[02:37:00]  The mother figure.  The balance.  Of course.  To get the ladies listening.  Right.  This is everything that the PDs that know nothing about broadcasting think is the way to go.  You've got to have a room full of guys.  No, you've got to put a girl in there, a woman in there to keep you all in check.  Why?  When you're hanging with your friends and you're laughing, how many times does the chick come  in and fucking contribute?  Just wreck it.  All they do is their energy is just not funny. 
[02:37:30]  It stinks.  It's just completely nurturing and dull.  I've heard it before.  And when you hear the woman in the mix, it sounds like she's part of the show.  But if you actually isolate what they're doing, you realize they have nothing to add.  Absolutely nothing to add.  So this person, Sassy, came up with this bit.  It would be just a woman isolated as the guys are doing the heavy lifting on a radio show.  Listen to this.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Well, I was just about to say, yes. 
[02:38:00]  Yes, exactly.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Boo.  You know, Marilyn Monroe was a size 14.  Uh-huh.  Now, now, hold on.  You're going to get us all in trouble.  Uh-huh.  Oh.  Oh.  Well, you get your mind out of the gutter.  Oh, that's perfect. 
[02:38:30]  No, that's not right.  Ha ha ha.  Oh, that's.  Oh, you guys have to stop.  Oh.  Boys will be boys.  Oh, please.  Women only do that in porno movies.  you know you're right yes uh-huh this is very accurate right yeah oh wait wait wait no come on

[02:44:00]  besides he stinks and i don't like him that's probably the greatest clip all right tony romando  magazine special issue win it every gadget in this issue is free every one of them what you're  giving away stuff this month the whole magazine everything in it's kind of our uh our shameless  promotion all right i'll take the car what do i do you uh go to the editor's letter there's a code  on it uh take your code go to the website enter for you i could rig it but uh not sure if it's legal  well if you want a car don't you have to sell the most amount of uh real estate for the month 
[02:44:30]  girl scout cookies second prize is a steak knife and uh third prize is you're fucking fired  it's actually it's one of those things that we we used to give away a lot of stuff and we realized  we'll just give away the whole issue and uh the amount of stuff that we're able to like acquire  either buy or just get for free was amazing everything from a like a tricked out ford fusion  to a year supply of bud uh select uh year supply of bratwurst flat screens phones you name it  motorcycles so it's the same issue that it's the same thing that we always put out but at the end of 
[02:45:00]  the day this one you can basically win every single thing in it everything in it like every  advertisement no no no there's a there's a little no to that uh all right can't be a butthole you  can't win the models i was gonna say can you win the broads can't win the advertising i never thought  that i thought like if there's an advertisement for a pentax camera here no but we you know the  advertisements are good but we got the same stuff in the editorial basically we did keep all the  underwear bras bikinis you can win that don't get so defensive i understand i get it all right so 
[02:45:30]  why don't we go through uh some of the the highlights of the latest issue there tony cool i think one of  the big things is uh last time i was here i was telling you guys about those hard drives those  computers that we bought and then we sent them out to get dissected oh yeah remember this ant yes we  came back we printed it basically sent them all out to the secret service where'd you get where'd you  get these uh hard drives from again we bought them all off uh ebay craigslist yeah this was well  because we got a lot of new listeners since you were last in basically they found uh people's  hard drives that they were selling on ebay and they bought them all and then they sent them to a lab 
[02:46:00]  to see exactly what's on them right yeah exactly all your old great idea so this yeah whole can be  you'd buy computers yeah yeah you know people the hard drive and see what people were and a lot of  people thought they got rid of everything but they didn't everybody thinks they got rid of it so this uh  secret x-secret service agent just tore them apart for like six months and i think the greatest thing  other were the emails like 100 of every every computer on their head at least 50 60 emails  that were buried somewhere in the back i mean i'm talking raunchy dirty you know i think the ones we 
[02:46:30]  printed like i can't hang out anymore my knees are swollen my feet hurt my back hurts from the stuff  you were doing to me i mean really embarrassing shocking stuff so what we did then was we took all  their information because everyone who had information on here had their phone number and all their you  know there's so we called them all to ask them what they thought about it and to see some of these people  uh kind of i mean smart people lawyers who know better with like divorce contracts scams  offshore accounts uh dirty photos of people uh it's pretty good it's pretty good to know that you  are never uh your stuff's never gone you're basically screwed how did they react to it most of a couple of 
[02:47:00]  the girls cried uh one lawyer threatened to sue us which he couldn't um but i mean other stuff like  people's full-blown account like their bank their bank account number their pin number things they  they would never expect now i mean if a bunch of you know retards at our magazine can get these  computers send them off to one guy you know a bunch of hackers could take you to the cleaners you know  it's probably worth buying one online or a few online for for the info you're going to get out of it  absolutely yeah so i mean you know at the end of the day we're not dateline so we're not trying to 
[02:47:30]  scare anyone but the best thing is to read people's emails and just watch how you know the interaction  guys cheating on their wives you know guys who are like you know my kid sucks at baseball you know i got  i mean the stuff that really hits home that you always think information you don't want to know  is the stuff that kind of blows your mind there's there was something else that hadn't didn't have  to do with it um that's i was when i got here you guys were talking about some kind of what was it  porn online or what was the pedophile site we found the pedophile that jimmy found yes it was actually 
[02:48:00]  sent to me by somebody pervertedjustice.com you gotta do something about this in the magazine it's good  stuff yeah i can only hear a bit from out there but what's the what's the gist they uh these guys pose  as uh kids 13 12 year old kids and they wait for some pedophile to approach them in a chat room  they talk as this person and they even have a girl that will call the guy if they can get the number  just to verify that it's really her and uh they get the pictures of the person and they get the uh  phone numbers of the person and then uh sometimes they tell them at the end sometimes they don't but 
[02:48:30]  then they post the whole thing on this very popular website transcripts of the conversation that  they have everything addresses and they send stuff to the guy's boss there's one i'm trying to sign  up their webcam pictures that they took and sent to them naked it's like an updated version of the  blotter when guys get busted with hookers and they run names exactly yeah i'm trying to sign up for the  chat room for some reason it's in my email no there's a chat room because they have updates about  how they flyer the homes and stuff to some of these guys with the information and the pictures  but is this like a religious right or is it no they're trying to get pedophiles it's nothing about 
[02:49:00]  politics or religious they're trying to get law enforcement no not even they're just people who  just i guess are uh with both guys trying to fuck 13 year old yeah because there's nothing you don't  need uh search warrants you don't need this is just people going hey we had a conversation online  this guy freely sent his pictures to me uh we're gonna post them on a website if the guy's got a  problem i'm sure he can sue right but he's gonna then draw more attention to it and like high-tech  vigilantes i guess yeah that's pretty much what they are and they put the flyers i guess with the 
[02:49:30]  pictures and all the information maybe of a guy jacking on his home um you know all over his  neighbors and stuff i mean they really humiliate you send that stuff to a boss that's it your  career is over fried yeah what a great idea though we actually covered this new website it's kind of  creepy but they're trying to promote it as good for the um sailor soldiers everyone's overseas it's  called highjoy.com and basically i don't know if you've heard this you you basically buy a vibrator  that has a usb attachment to it that plugs into your keyboard or like a they call the sailor's best  friend pocket pussy and yeah guy for a guy and a girl and basically you log on to this 
[02:50:00]  it's a chat group of thousands of people and you have like controls kind of like your radio controls  where you like an equalizer and you basically pleasure someone from millions of miles away  through you which is super creepy you manipulate the pocket pussy exactly with something on your end  so you could be given a hand job or something like that exactly from millions of miles away well  they try to they try to what planet are they on they try to claim it's for like those uh you know  husband and wife duos they're split on coast to coast or sailors who miss their wives but at the 
[02:50:30]  end of the day it's just a bunch of pigs in there like it's bad enough chatting with somebody and and  they turn out to be a guy instead of a 13 year old girl oh billy yeah imagine you're sitting there  getting a virtual handy by some big fat construction worker on the other end yeah those things always go  do you want to see my picture surprise you know how awful someone gives a hand job in person you  imagine a cyber hand job yank your dick once and then go to the side then back down into your pubes 
[02:51:00]  how awful that would be i'll just do this myself thank you did you guys try it out though have  anyone at the office one of the guys tried it out and it worked he didn't take his pants down the  office but he did take it home try it out but i mean at the end of the day it's so sterile in it and  you don't know who you're dealing with and it was it's kind of a bust you know we busted on it  ourselves but you got to start somewhere and then the next gadget they come out with they'll be a  little better we know how this works yeah you'll be strapped in like a fully automated woman but uh  no it's got to be like the old 80s movies where you put on those ridiculous virtual reality goggles 
[02:51:30]  and lay back and it's a perfect image of a woman sitting on top of you and you're feeling it with  your dopey virtual reality gloves i say right now it's a good idea it's going to take some time to  figure out the bug so guys in the lab hang in there and keep going that's it because think  about it 10 years from now i think it'll be a lot better experience it'll really feel like it i think  so i think so if the girl has like a dildo right and it's hooked up to her computer and you slide 
[02:52:00]  something over your schlong and she starts sucking on the dildo it'll feel exactly like a bj i think  eventually they'll they'll figure that out yes i think there isn't something more important to work  on right now well the robots are getting better you know the first robots were all  and falling down and stuff could barely you know go forward and now they're kind of waving and stuff  oh my god that was you i thought a robot actually walked into the room i thought it startled me  that was an awful robot impression all just wobbly 
[02:52:30]  ah will robinson ah there you go  robot tony what what else is in the magazine basically just uh more of the same motorcycles  atvs flat screens uh we we started something new we do the top 10 cameras cell phones tvs but  i guess the real gist of this this issue that goes on sale tomorrow is that it's uh it's just all free  you know you don't there's no strings attached i'm not trying to capture information there's 
[02:53:00]  you just have to sign up to win all this uh fine stuff in the magazine that's very cool yeah buy it  go to the uh get your code out of the front of the magazine just hit what's you giving away one of  each sometimes multiple i mean you know one car one motorcycle what's the uh what's the hottest  gadget out there right now in your opinion out of all gadgets whether it's a phone mp3 player  satellite radio hottest gadget for me is that there's this thing called the motorella ojo and basically  it's a it's a video phone it stands about 16 inches maybe 12 inches tall put it on your desk 
[02:53:30]  it's like the first time that you know you see these crap video or their phone video cameras that  you're supposed to be able to talk to someone from across the country and they're always blurry and  they don't work this one's like the true it's like true time it's the first one that actually  doesn't blur and the voice catches up with the vision i sent one a buddy of mine in chicago who  the guy's a total pig and he's oh he's single he's always out picking up girls and  he claims that each one is always the hottest chick ever so he has one so we did like a month-long test  where every time he brought a girl home we had to you know you present her in front of this camera 
[02:54:00]  but basically you plug it in through your internet and uh uh you're good to go it's uh it's true  life so if you have like a sick mother across the country good for families but also good for  catching your friend with fatties yeah that's what you use it for your sick mom  not only is she irritating and talk to but you want to look at her laying there with her fucking  feet up in a bed yeah tony please some people enjoy family time nobody wants to talk to their  mother on a video phone you talk to her on the phone how are you supposed to make up an excuse  if you can see you hey look ma i gotta go the guys are here then you're sitting there by yourself 
[02:54:30]  but where are the guys put them in on the camera and we all know all new technology is about sex to  begin with and then eventually you figure out other ways to use that technology they talk about the  printing press and the the one thing that it was used for the most out of anything was just telling  sex stories right back in the day and then eventually like whoa hey we could write down  other crap with this thing you know but it always starts with sex the internet same thing man i mean  when we all got our first computers what were we doing the whole porno thing slowly downloading  but now it's like wait you could uh do online banking and you could uh get a flood you know now 
[02:55:00]  finally you're figuring out other other uses yeah porn drives it all the same thing is going to be with  the video phones obviously you know it's gonna be people that are separated and then eventually  all right let me see the goddamn grandkids yeah i mean the thing actually works the new baby and stuff  it's quite impressive i haven't uh used it for sex yet nor sick mothers but uh yeah it'll come around  well the beautiful thing is if you have a certain kind of family maybe you could use it for the same thing  what are you wearing mom orthopedic shoes and a diaper 
[02:55:30]  uh what else you got in here tony we got uh we also took we took three women there's i guess this  guy across town up there is this like magic scientific machine that hold on we got to break  into you this exclusive interview with uh tony uh romando from sick magazine because we got a uh  hall of famer on the line here it's cal ripton jr everyone cal hey good morning welcome to the  show we got uh little jimmy norton in studio and uh tony romando who who's the editor of sink 
[02:56:00]  magazine which is a gadget magazine so all right how are you mr ripkin i'm doing pretty well thanks  how long you had a show uh next time now not long enough oh really um no uh you know we're once a  week and uh we're getting up and running and trying to feel uh um where our place would be  different uh different type of business huh oh absolutely i mean uh i never had any judgment 
[02:56:30]  one way or another how difficult it would be but once you get into it um it is pretty much a full  time job it seems pretty easy radio up until uh right up until you have to do it like everyone  thinking about radio it's like oh that seems like an easy gig and then you get in there and realize  you have to talk for so long and it has to be something of substance most of the time well that's  that's the big problem i think is that you have to prepare for it you have to look at the issues you  kind of comb what you think you want to talk about but then you really don't know that once you start  having to fill time uh the worst thing that can happen is you start rambling and we actually start 
[02:57:00]  off with our we have a section in the first part of the show is we call ripkin ramblings because  darn if we weren't rambling so much um early on that we just decided we're going to call that segment  of the show uh rambling but but the more you talk and the less you think about it the less  substantive your uh message becomes do you do you uh is it mostly sports or you guys find yourself  just going off on uh politics or just lifestyle no we're very narrow-minded you know we only know 
[02:57:30]  about uh one thing that's baseball uh-huh but actually i joined in uh you know i think xm's a  great uh product and we had talks in the early stages about uh you know me coming on to support  and endorse um you know that as a spokesperson but also the the show uh platform uh i had the ability  to talk about major league baseball billy certainly has the same sort of credentials that i that i do  but i i uh i jumped on board because i wanted to have a segment about uh youth baseball i want to  have a platform in which uh all the youth coaches uh you know could uh tap into and we could actually 
[02:58:00]  talk directly to the to the to the coaches at the grassroots and the kids at the grassroots and  uh whatever that was on their minds uh we would like to discuss because all the issues whether  you're in you know where i am in aberdeen maryland um the local rec rec issues are the same here  as it is in any other uh part of the country yeah you well you've kicked off uh a baseball camp  haven't you well i mean since i've retired uh i have uh taken on a pretty herculean task which is  uh to try to grow baseball worldwide and really what uh and that's our mission but uh i think that's a 
[02:58:30]  little lofty uh but but i have a whole league that's named after me you know babe ruth baseball  renamed uh their lower division six years ago to california baseball i was gonna say your name's  babe ruth named after me babe ruth i changed my name to babe ruth that's true it used to be called  the bambino division because babe ruth used to be 13 and over and then they went to a younger division  uh early 80s and uh they wanted to to really grow that part of their um and that is the largest  division so they decided they were going to take a chance and name it after me and uh we've been 
[02:59:00]  growing we're the only youth baseball league that's growing i guess we're considered technically  competitors of little league although i don't look at it that way i think whatever good ideas  that we might bring to the table for for the kids and uh uh and in a teaching sense or a  philosophical sense i think uh if anybody else adopts that then you know and all the legs of  the kids went out and that's who we're really targeting now cal i i know you you you have a  great image um what do you ever see a kid though i know you wouldn't say anything to him but you 
[02:59:30]  see one kid and just go wow this kid has no place in baseball whatsoever and what do you do  well an image comes from um you know consistent behavior over a long period of time and it doesn't  mean that you're goody two shoes right from the beginning and a lot of people would argue that i'm  not goody two shoes anyway and uh your image tends in the in the in the marketplace or the media  to be a little overblown and maybe exaggerated either way you enjoy a blue colored joke every so 
[03:00:00]  often right sure actually anthony brings up a good point because i have a nephew his uh name's jd7 and  he already has a incredible skills on the uh on uh you know the baseball field and i i go to a lot of  his games and you just see those other kids that you just wish maybe someone would you know pull  them aside and go maybe you should try another not to discourage them i don't i don't believe in  that but maybe try to uh steer them in a different direction like some skates yeah like my my uh 
[03:00:30]  nephew's getting down on the ground balls and digging in and and you know he's just got really  good skills at seven and then you got this kid who runs the first base and then he starts like  spinning around like a ballerina you know what are you doing that you're looking at skill levels not  attitudes or reputations or yeah what what are you doing you you're cal rip can do and you you see  this happening at one of your uh one of your baseball camps and and what do you do well the reality  is uh kids develop at all different uh levels and you want to keep an open mind as much as you can 
[03:01:00]  to give them an opportunity to develop i can't tell you how many people that i played against  that i thought were just true absolute superstars but all of a sudden their development stopped  really abruptly the guys that are superstars at 12 uh most of them don't even make the high school  team and you would think you would think that that would be the wrong sort of thinking so you have  to keep an open mind and you try to give them enough of the skills but certainly there are there are kids  that you know just don't doesn't have the hand-eye coordination but i still want them to try to enjoy  the sport uh most people that do play the sport and i want to try to encourage them to play the sport as 
[03:01:30]  long as they they are able uh because they're the next generation of baseball fans they're going to  share their experiences or their fun or their love of the sport with their families down the road  and they become the next people that tune into the tv and watch uh watch the game at the ballpark so  i think truly uh like any other any other thing it really starts at the grassroots level and baseball  would really you know uh do itself uh justice for the long term by really focusing on the grassroots  and trying to get kids uh excited and interested in baseball again you know they start to slip to 
[03:02:00]  other sports uh football and uh basketball seems to have uh captured some of the interest of uh of the  kids and it'd be great for uh for baseball and you know for every guy everybody that has played  baseball to try to focus on um you know showing the kids how great a game it is yeah when did you  know that you had uh had something as a kid how old were you do you remember well i think uh relatively  speaking uh when you look around i always knew that i had a little bit more talent and i grew up in a  baseball family genetically i was very gifted and i was at the ballpark in and minor league baseball my 
[03:02:30]  dad was a minor league manager then and i got to catch and throw a whole lot more than the other kids  yeah and uh but i knew i had a little bit more more of a talent just because things came a lot  easier to me but as you go up those levels that you're challenged at get harder and harder and  harder and most people can remember the levels of play in uh in in little league at 12 years old but  they can't uh they don't fathom what it's like when you leave high school um and they leave high school 
[03:03:00]  and in some cases you go to college and then you start all over again when you get to pro ball  every time you make another jump you were the star of your team when you were there and you go up to  the next level you become less of a star and more like one of the one of the persons there  it was a it was abrupt awakening when i left high school to go to pro ball i was the star on my high  school team sure then you're assembled with stars of all the other high school teams and all the other  college teams and you don't feel so good about yourself anymore so you got to go back and work a  little harder you i mean you you broke i i think what is probably going to be this two records in 
[03:03:30]  baseball i think will probably never be broken cy young and i and i think this one now i don't think  anybody will ever play as many games in a row as you did when you when you hear a kid like who's  like he says he doesn't want to play a game because he has a cold or something you ever just want to  grab him by the shoulders and scream you know toughen up fag i've never had that urge you know it is it  is really interesting because the expectations um i didn't i i wasn't someone that had a 10 uh 100  attendance in high school i wasn't someone that played every single game all the way through youth 
[03:04:00]  baseball and even in the minor leagues first time i played every every single game in the season was  in double a and it was the longest and hardest season i played 144 games and the reason i played  in all those games wasn't because i set out to do that it was just my dad said this is your job this  is your role um as a baseball player you're supposed to come to the ballpark ready to play  and available to the manager and if you really look at the streak and how it was defined you know i had  some very good managers early on in my career that kept writing my name in the lineup and the 
[03:04:30]  streak was really established because those managers kept wanting me to play and i kept playing and i  honestly believe all players in the big leagues should come to the ballpark with that simple  honest philosophy and the manager's job the reason you hire that manager is for him to choose those  nine players on a daily basis that can uh they can help you win so so i i don't look in and i and i  really don't judge even my own son or anybody else you got to sit back and say learn the game  love the game and hopefully you have the skills that uh will put you in a position that i was in 
[03:05:00]  in uh in my life how far into it were you when you started to realize like i actually have a shot  at garrick's record like where you might like any injury that say may have kept you out under normal  circumstances that you started to play through and say look i can't blow this now like how long  into it before i started thinking started to happen i never i never said i can't blow this now  but all the way through when you play 162 games and you come to the ballpark again with that  attitude there are there are most of the days you're not a hundred percent and it's impossible  for anybody even the reserve players that sit on the bench and does and get 200 bats for the course 
[03:05:30]  of the season when you travel and you play and you practice every single day you're not going to be  at your uh your your hundred percent it's it it's how you play in those games that you feel the worst  and luckily enough for me when i uh would have a small injury or i would have uh something i'd have  to get through somehow your ability to focus and concentrate would go up and i would actually play  better when uh when the expectations were were a little bit lowered i remember i hyper extended  my elbow one time sliding in the second base and when i went to the on deck circle i couldn't swing 
[03:06:00]  the bat comfortably in the on deck circle and i was really concerned that i wasn't going to be able  to hit i immediately figured out when i swung and missed it hurt like uh uh like it hurt like all get  out okay you could say whatever you want satellite actually a lot of people are begging you to curse  it would make their year if you just said one curse they know i do on a regular basis  the uh when you uh swing and when you swung and hit the ball it didn't hurt so therefore you became  i became more selective at the plate and i really focused it every time that i was going to swing 
[03:06:30]  the bat which might be a really good way to hit anyway yeah but i made sure that i hit the ball and  i got hotter than i had ever been in my career because of a hyper extended elbow  did you at one point i know i think you need to start traveling separately from the team at one  point were there security concerns like i know when uh i think it was uh it was maris was uh going  for ruth's record he was getting like death threats and there's just somebody and hank aaron got him i  mean there's so many sociopaths out there did you get any of that crap yeah the uh during the uh the 
[03:07:00]  year that the record was broken uh there were many kind of crazies that uh that gave in uh those sort  of threats that uh and then they came into the form of the hotels or the ballparks and all of  them didn't check out but i mean it doesn't mean that you you are all of them weren't very they  didn't mean anything uh but at the time you had to really take it sort of more seriously and i guess  because you go through an experience like that you become a little bit more security conscious and  you make decisions in in your life um and and some of that stuff got all all blown out of proportion 
[03:07:30]  but uh you know you make those choices and you try to do what's best uh uh for you and uh what's  best for your family and you know i didn't stay in a separate hotel because of uh security reasons  when i started to get more attention and my daily routines were thrown off staying in a team hotel  environment was uh for my personality in a way that i tried to give i tried to give everything i could  to the people in an autograph form and to the media and also to uh me as a player and you needed some 
[03:08:00]  downtime to recharge and when you went back to the team hotel that sort of situation kept escalating  and escalating where you wouldn't get any sort of peace away from the ballpark and one time that  and when my wife would travel with me on the road i'd always stay at a different place to take her out  of that environment one time uh she didn't join me on the trip and i was there at a hotel by myself  and it was in new york and i came down and i and i found there was a certain peace that i felt was  really healthy for me that uh in certain cities when uh when when those situations were at its 
[03:08:30]  worst that i would take advantage of that and so i didn't stay in all hotels away from the teams but  the ones that uh were the were the hard ones for me to recharge you know i would go ahead and and  take that into my own hands and and i was very upfront about it i told everybody so everybody knew  where i was going to going to be and never missed the team bus never missed you know uh um any sort  of uh game and and uh we're all adults anyway after all yeah what do you do to get away from  baseball because i mean it's got to be it's got to be frustrating that everybody that talks to you 
[03:09:00]  has to talk about baseball uh what do you do you like astronomy cal what like what else uh interest  you what do you do to get away from from it well i wasn't kidding so much when i said that i really  have a narrow existence sports has been my life yeah baseball i do enjoy talking about and  examining and and looking into um so as a hobby you know if you're looking at other hobbies other  sports are or my hobby i love basketball i built a gym inside my house uh you know partly uh to 
[03:09:30]  rationalize that i needed to train in the off season but it was really so i could play basketball at  home i see something off the wall though like you like chemistry and have a chemistry set in your  basement or something no i hate chemistry it's crossword puzzles crossword puzzles this is times crossword  i was very good in math and so now my kids are going through uh through school and they got to  come home with homework uh when it comes to science things i don't like science things at all no i didn't  seem to get it so i'm not very helpful there you play chess when it comes to math chess uh intrigued me  for a little while but uh let that go a long time ago this is an important baseball question sure why do 
[03:10:00]  they call randy johnson the big unit i've heard different rumors i have heard different rumors and it's if it's  if it's because of the reason i'm thinking of uh i just love the fact that they'll call that on  national television they have no idea why well i've never been a teammate of his so i really don't  can't answer that question but is that what the rumor is right that he's a big hog oh i have no idea  sorry i had to ask you that you're a hall of famer and i asked about another man's penis but i mean  i've heard that's awful that's what that's what the rumor is on randy johnson it's just funny on 
[03:10:30]  national television i always assume it was because he was 6'10 right i think that's how they get away  with it but i think you know it's like a little nod and a wink so what were you guys talking about on  your show yesterday cal what's the big baseball story that you guys are focusing on well we  examined uh uh everybody wanted i was in the bahamas when the rafael palmero store came out  yeah and everybody wanted my reaction to that and when we came back i uh i was promoting a uh  a champion's tour golf tournament here in town uh with constellation energy and then i became available  to the media so um i uh they were able to get a response from me but we in the show we we really 
[03:11:00]  looked at the public relations aspect of uh some of the decisions and how you go about it  we don't know a whole lot about the legal uh ramifications because it seems like the  lawyers seem to say you can't say anything because it might affect the case or you know  there's a perjury trial going on or the congressional hearing uh information but just from a straight  public relations how uh rafi seemed to look more guilty by the way that he was handling it  and my reaction was i was hoping that there's some sort of plausible explanation  you know uh as an as uh someone that uh uh and from a common sense standpoint you start to wonder 
[03:11:30]  whether that's really going to be the case or not and the longer it lasts the longer it goes you  realize there might not be an explanation for it but uh we looked at the public relations aspect and  how uh we had a guy by the name of john maroon on that uh was the director of public relations when i  was going through in 1995 who also works for for us now at ripian baseball but he has a good good  perspective on how he would advise players during tough situations and he has some good good 
[03:12:00]  experience with that so we kind of examined that from more young players coming to the big leagues  they don't really know what to do but they have to handle the media the media is way more savvy  and they know how to actually work the different angles and kind of get people to say you know  things that they want them to say they're more experienced at it on a day-to-day basis and it seems  to be a little bit more of a mismatch so we just examined you know what might be the right way  if raphael uh you know was was totally guilty guilty we looked at the hypotheticals how would  he actually come clean and uh and uh you know say you're sorry and and move on with his career and 
[03:12:30]  or but more importantly how how he could go on with his life hey uh that was a long-winded  explanation wasn't it but it was good i could ramble hey cal what what what do you think of that  urban legend about you and uh kevin cosner what do i think about it yeah the rumors you're talking  about yeah it's like it's urban myth now it's one of those like urban legends that obviously is  false but uh it must come up a lot what is what do you and your family think about that one i don't 
[03:13:00]  i mean uh there's a small urban legend around here that i sold my house to uh will smith really and  people have actually come up and uh asked for will at my front door a couple times but um i don't  know i mean i guess at some point when you reach a uh level of popularity and uh you become more  interesting uh to other people uh in many different ways and i can't really begin to fathom  uh i've never been a gossipy person or someone that would actually talk about people uh unless 
[03:13:30]  you really knew but uh that seems to be a symptom of popularity so you uh you live it you uh accept it  there's not a whole lot you can do about it you can just uh control what you do in your life and  what you stand for you ever meet kevin cosner yeah and have you ever talked about it  let's go laugh you must go laugh about it i think that's how the whole all the rumors started is  that uh early you know i did uh meet him and uh you know we became uh pretty good friends there 
[03:14:00]  early on uh and uh then he got busy we got busy and uh so he was coming to the ballpark a couple  times he was seen uh you know in my seats right and uh we had done done a couple things together but  you know i have talked to him about it and and his his uh way to deal with it is say look you know i'm  gonna go out there you know i'm tired of this let me just set the record straight and i went i went  well to me you know it is what it is and uh it's not true and you only bring more attention to it by  screaming and yelling yeah why don't you just let it uh let's stay where it is so we have two 
[03:14:30]  different ways of handling it well for your uh i don't know for your peace of mind it's on what's  called snopes.com which is an urban legend site and it's clearly marked as false yeah well it is false  but uh there was no blackout that day no at the stadium you're talking about the lights well yeah  well that's that's that's a really uh um if you really just looked into it just a little bit the  lights that uh when they canceled the game to preserve my streak because of my personal issues 
[03:15:00]  supposedly right yeah with kevin costum in life yeah in that particular game alone it's really really  interesting because uh we had to make a decision whether we'd play with uh the bank of lights  out and you know who was pitching the big unit randy johnson was pitching in that game  and we had to decide uh we'd make up the game tomorrow the next day uh in a day game and i had  the idea to say look i'd rather face him with a little bit lower lights in nighttime because uh the  background's better in camden yards a lefty throwing out of the bleachers out of center field 
[03:15:30]  is not good when a guy's throwing 100 miles an hour so i was actually out on the field testing  whether we could play so you actually wanted to uh play more than i guess yeah well i was out there  standing on the field playing catch while the umpires were viewing okay i was helped determining  whether to determining whether there was enough light to actually play and i said there was and  where was kevin costner sir i don't know but i think that's the lupinella that thought the game 
[03:16:00]  was canceled i think a couple of their guys started drinking a couple beers and that was it hey did you  ever play for uh cal your play for all weaver you did right i did yes did you ever hear that  great clip it's our favorite sound clip is it uh i'm sure i've heard it uh up front and live  oh yeah yeah he had quite the potty mouth yeah we'll play that going into break actually he's a  good motivator yeah hey i have a question that's kind of off the record i met you uh once in uh in  the xm thing in uh vegas and we took a picture together so if i send it to you would you autograph it 
[03:16:30]  sure but you don't you'd have to send it to the right address you're in dc right uh yeah you can  send it there i might as well give out your home address right now how do you feel about signing  things especially with people really profiteering on uh on signing i mean do you make a distinction  between a kid that wants an autograph and some guy that's obviously a collector well over the years  with enough experience you can see which ones are doing it for a living which ones aren't  but uh if there's any doubt i would always uh err on the side of thinking he was uh not a collector 
[03:17:00]  oh that's cool all right we should let cal go cal thanks uh so much hold on we got to get the uh  the plug in 2005 cal ripkin world series is happening now right cal that's right that's where i'm heading  from here i'm going up there to uh the final game is uh on the 21st but we're deciding who gets there  right now it's a small version of camden yards they built oh it's cal seniors yard it's a beautiful  beautiful facility i think it's it's uh unlike any other uh little guy's field uh in this country  or anywhere else and for tickets you call 410-547 seat 410-547 seat and let's not forget you're doing 
[03:17:30]  the radio thing on xm uh channel 175 right yep 175 uh it's uh on it's uh saturday mornings at 10  it starts at 10 it says 8 to 10 8 to 10 saturday morning and sunday 9 to 11 i misspoke right  okay yep cal this was a pleasure for us you have no idea man continuing success with uh all the  stuff you're doing there thank you thanks for calling in it's cal ripkin jr have a great show 
[03:18:00]  take care bye-bye pretty cool what was that talking with the legend dude in a hundred years  when they look in record books his name is still going to be there yeah no one is breaking that  record nobody i gotta be honest we're all a little timid to bring up the kevin costner i had to bring  it up come on you have no and was great guy handles it i'll be honest i'm i'm i'm holding  up a note to jimmy jimmy backs off i'm like anthony you know i wasn't gonna do it i didn't even know  about it basically something to do with like they actually turned the lights off at the ballpark  because here's what the story is all right you got it on snopes uh it's false it says cal ripkin jr 
[03:18:30]  was allowing kevin costner the actor to stay in his house following the wrap-up of the postman  one day ripkin left for camden yards to play in a game somewhere between his home and the stadium  cal realized that he had left something back at his house turned back to retrieve it upon arriving  at his house he found kevin costner in bed with his wife kelly cal then proceeded to beat the crap  out of costner to the point that costner was unable to make any public uh appearances for a time cal  then called the orioles and told them he wouldn't be coming into play that day upon hearing this 
[03:19:00]  the owner reminded cal about the streak telling him the streak would end if he didn't play that day  cal told him it was impossible for him to come in so there went the streak reportedly the owner  told him not to worry because he would take care of it that night the game was canceled due to  electrical failure with some lights on the field the caller said that there was no problem with the  lights uh and that everything else including the hotels and restaurant are a part of camden yards  worked perfectly the next day the lights were fixed cal was able to play and the streak stayed intact 
[03:19:30]  um obviously it was all fake that uh never happened that way like uh cal said there was a problem with  the lights that's why they called the game he was there wasn't a problem with uh kevin costner at his  house isn't maybe what assholes fans are like the lights go out and they have to find a reason to  like make some kind of a sexual awful scandal you know what it is it's typical conspiracy theory public  they love a secret that they figured out and this is just another one light failure what the streak didn't 
[03:20:00]  end because of the oh that's what it was kevin costner all right why don't we take a break and we'll  continue with tony from sync magazine after the break and then um  totally nailed him oh no oh you want to play games yeah i'll play games  point jimmy that's right damn it i play in the majors you go play in the little cow league  is that the reason for all the lysol yeah oh yeah we all have our own lysol well what about opie he

[03:24:00]  they've given away a lot of free stuff a lot of free stuff pretty much everything in the magazine  as you read it hey i win i didn't know was the cosner thing a touchy issue huge yeah is it like  touchy you're still i still think it was good to ask because i had no idea i like i i just blurted  it out but i didn't know what is is he like who told you it was a touchy you know not to talk about  that around him or who said that i don't know it just seems like it's a i don't know issue iffy  a lot of people i think it depends on how you address it and the way you do is was really 
[03:24:30]  respectful and not like a dick i mean if someone like came out right ago so what's this you know  yeah look it's a legitimate question it was it was a giant rumor uh a bullshit rumor but in the  middle of chasing one of the most you know the one of the most unbreakable streaks in all sports  so i mean it's not a crazy question it's not like something from childhood with a you know whatever  it was uh i think it was a legitimate question he asked yes he asked it uh well  he did because you're very good at that you asked it well and he did jimmy and he answered it well 
[03:25:00]  he didn't freak out he knows he was friends with cosner had a lot of respect for that  the rumor came up definitely um all right tony did we cover everything you think are we missing  anything how often should i get a new phone good point and good question i keep getting phones  and then like a month or so later i'll look at someone else's phone and go motherfucker you'll  never that's a better phone than mine you'll never catch up to no everyone else has but now that you  have like a sim card in it you can switch every six months you don't have to you know switch services 
[03:25:30]  and all that you just pop the card out and put it in sim card isn't going to give me a better  display and i'm not going to be able to like you know get live video on it it depends on what you  want i mean there's you know if you're looking just surf the internet or take video or yeah i like  surfing the internet on the phone but i don't like surfing the internet with that stupid servers that  are only available to like wap you know those horrible servers that you get you can't get to any  real websites you know you get to these phone websites i like regular websites but i don't want to  carry around something that's you know the size of uh one of those a trio what are they called

[03:29:00]  through the groundbreaking medical experiments we have succeeded in resuscitating your mother  uh from her lifeless state but when she pressed for more information from dr schneider head surgeon  at columbia presbyterian the person wrote back no actually you stupid cunt bitch she's fucking dead  yeah uh which way is north oh all right why don't you put the right template on there what is wrong  with this today it's actually me i can't blame anyone else i screwed up you have template one on there 
[03:29:30]  right i set it for one what are you set for i thought you're set for three i thought i had a  one i was hoping to get the studio audience on that one i know that's the one i was going for  that was the good one you got all right let's let's just finish the last one you can't opie i'm  telling you they'll laugh timing i screwed you up jimmy no you didn't i get a failing mark on today's  radio show cut it out you it'll still work i was hanging in there with the c minus but i'm i've

[03:30:30]  word there so it went out over uh tv wait wait it was a graphic they put up the text yeah and they  left cunt in yeah someone screwed up wouldn't you just type dot dot dot right obviously someone  just typed it up as it was you know as it was really supposed to be right and sent it to the  newsroom and no one uh double checked it to go whoa hey yeah well that must have looked great  that was a big story over the weekend so yeah the c word was on cbs tv what kind of scumbag would do 
[03:31:00]  that i don't know what kind of idiot thinks there's some process that uh you never know you got an  older person she's 89 who knows you know i don't know it's hello we have a life-saving  experimental surgery you can contact me at bob edwards at xm radio  poor bob edwards ghoul he never did anything wrong nothing other than turn into a small flying 
[03:31:30]  mammal and leave the scene of a biting i don't even think the guy gossips behind our back horse  he doesn't at the water cooler nothing saint nothing from him and we just slam him every  chance we get he's the nicest dude i've walked by his studio he's just sitting there drinking a glass  of blood apparently  pulpy kool-age  i had to make up for the the wrong button i pushed oh bob edwards is a vampirish creepy 
[03:32:00]  can we get the oompa loompa in before we leave unfortunately we're running out of show here  let's see a guy claims that he was one of willy wonka's oompa loompas in the original 1971 motion  picture uh the willy wonka movie uh back then uh and he's uh he's been selling himself as this guy  for years ever since then he's obviously a fidget  and uh someone called him out on it finally and he's come forward and said yes  he was lying and he was not an oompa loompa 
[03:32:30]  that's terrific  that's terrific  little fidget yeah he said it was not for the fame or glory he never made profit or earned financial gain  from this so they can't arrest him or anything  uh asked why he did it there's something so special when a child looks at a little person  and they're not scared or feel like they're looking at a freak  when you say you played that part they look at you and smile they see you as a human being 
[03:33:00]  he never intended harm to anyone uh or his community while he told this little white lie  but it became uh my haunted nightmare he says constantly trying to cover up the fact that he  wasn't an oompa loompa because he was five eight can i say how great it is how fucking far down the 
[03:33:30]  scale is your life that your idea of getting dignity is falsely claiming that you played a chocolate  making midget with green hair who rhymed a lot this guy's a little jizz bucket  he uh he was 23 at the time when he uh told his agent to pad his resume with an acting credit from  uh willie wonka and the chocolate factory do you know how this guy should be punished instead of  being arrested he should be forced for the rest of his life to dress like an oompa loompa  while large negroes dress like willie wonka and rape his mouth 
[03:34:00]  the real humorous note to this though they found out what happened to the original uh 10 oompa loompas  and uh apparently let's see eight of them are dead uh one of them is in seclusion and the uh other  one is in a nursing home blind and with alzheimer's there is a god that's gonna be a great version of that  song oompa loompas 
[03:34:30]  And I just can't see.  Yeah, a little Alzheimer blind midget running around screaming things from the past.  I'd like to go and hug that Oompa Loompa and then just pick it up and throw it on the hospital floor and scold it.  Smash its head on the corner of a porcelain sink. 
[03:35:00]  Don't we have the music?  That would have been cool.  I like that.  Oompa Loompa-dee-doo.  No.  I can't remember.  I have to go poo.  Oompa, Oompa, Loompa-dee-doo.  I've got a perfect puzzle for you.  Oompa, Oompa, Loompa-dee-dee.  If you are wise, you'll listen to me.  They can sing.  All right, we've got to get out of here.  Yeah, we have no time to go off on 800 Oompa Loompa.  I was really hoping we could die.
