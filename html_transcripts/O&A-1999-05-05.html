<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show featured a segment centered around a bizarre and physically aggressive stunt.  Two men, "Paul" and an unnamed contestant, were chained to chairs, minimally clothed, and subjected to a series of groin kicks.  The kicks were administered first by a woman named Ellen, and later by an unnamed "Grandma."  Before the kicks, at least one of the men was also whipped. The segment heavily emphasized the men's reactions to the pain – their yelps, expressions of shock, and overall suffering – which were met with running commentary from Opie and Anthony, who oscillated between simulated concern and boisterous amusement. The hosts provided detailed descriptions of each kick and its impact, focusing on the men's responses and endurance. The final discussion speculated on the men's pain tolerance and whether such experiences were generally enjoyable for men.  No other guests beyond Ellen and "Grandma" are mentioned in the provided summary.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Two guys getting kicked hard, right in the crotch, with no protection.  All right, I guess he's ready to be kicked.  He's ready to be kicked.  Oh no, this is just wrong, man.  Oh, how did this degenerate into this?  He is on his knees.  He is chained to the bottom of the chair.  His stuff, as it would be, is a little too prominent in those bikini panties.  Girl panties.  He put on his sister's, his little sister's panties today. 
[00:00:30]  Isn't that cute?  She's putting a thing in his mouth to bite on.  Panties.  Oh, panties.  Oh, I didn't know.  Oh, those are your panties?  Spike.  Yeah.  She's got the whip, too.  She's bending his head back, straddling him, and she's whipping his body, his tummy and lower region.  Oh, that's got to hurt.  That has got to hurt.  Oh, that got him. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, that got him.  That got him.  That got him.  That got him.  Look, he almost fell down.  If he wasn't chained up, he would have fallen down.  Spike, stay up.  Spike is comforting him now.  I am.  Spike's comforting him.  Did you see him flinch?  And he hasn't been kicked yet.  That was just the whip.  He's lining up.  Oh!  He's just kicking him.  Oh!  Oh, he just buckled over.  He just doubled over in pain. 
[00:01:30]  He's breathing really heavy.  I have never seen anything like this.  He's lining up again.  Oh!  Oh, he's flinching.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  All right, Paul is still on his knees, and Ellen's going to start kicking now.  She's been done wrong by a lot of guys.  Here she goes.  She's lining up.  Oh! 
[00:02:00]  Paul goes, you didn't even make me flinch.  And then she kicked.  And then she went for it.  He's flinching now at the drop of a hat.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, that was a good one.  That, he almost fell over.  Oh, look, look, he's ready to woof, I think.  You all right, Paul?  Oh!  I just hope I get a seat on the subway.  Are we ready for contestant number two?  I'm a little scared.  I'm ready.  All right, I guess we're ready for more of this.  I would miss this for the world. 
[00:02:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, my God!  Oh, it's the right one.  I'm going to need some water suit.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Spike, don't shake it too hard.  Oh, God! 
[00:03:00]  Oh!  Ah!  Oh!  Oh!  I can't take any more eyes.  That was a bad one.  I can't take any more eyes.  That's a flash.  Is that me or the camera? 
[00:03:30]  I can't see it light.  That's got to be it.  That's got to be it.  I got a shot of that on the video.  That will make you cringe. 
[00:04:00]  All right, let's see if we can't get a good kick in from Grandma.  Grandma is lining up.  She just gave us three quick shots.  She gave us three quick shots.  Grandma gave us three.  All right, hold on, Grandma.  How are you holding up?  I'm not.  I'm with Grandma.  Grandma is pretty good. 
[00:04:30]  You missed, Grandma.  He's down.  He's down.  He's down.  You don't call Grandma like that.  Come on.  Grandma is a good shot.  Oh, yeah.  She got the bullseye.  I'm still got a chance, right?  Let's hear it for Grandma.  Grandma, put him down.  God, did she line up and kick him?  Someone's got to put a stop to this. 
[00:05:00]  This is just not right.  It's really not right.  We must say, because we have a lot of ladies that listen to us.  Yeah.  Ladies, not all guys enjoy this.  He's a freak of masculinity.  Oh, sure.  A man, a man.  Well, then call me a pussy.  I found my women. </pre>
