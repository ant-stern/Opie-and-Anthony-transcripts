<pre> Two guys getting kicked hard right in the crotch with no protection.  Alright, I guess he's ready to be kicked.  He's ready to be kicked.  Oh no, this is just wrong, man.  Oh, how did this degenerate into this?  He is on his knees, he is chained to the bottom of the chair.  His stuff, as it would be, is a little too prominent in those bikini panties.  He put on his little sister's panties today. 
[00:30]
 Isn't that cute?  She's putting a thing in his mouth to bite on.  Panties.  Oh, panties.  Oh, I didn't know.  Oh, those are your panties?  Spike.  Yeah.  She's got the whip too.  She's bending his head back, straddling him and she's whipping his body, his tummy in  lower region.  That's gotta hurt.  That has gotta hurt.  That got him.  That got him.  He almost fell down.  If he wasn't chained up, he would have fallen down. 
[01:00]
 Spike is comforting him now.  Spike is comforting him.  Did you see him flinch?  And he hasn't been kicked yet.  That was the whip.  He's lining up.  Did you see him kick him?  He's not kicking.  He's not kicking.  He's not kicking.  He's not kicking.  He's not kicking.  He's not kicking.  He's not kicking.  He's not kicking.  He's not kicking.  He's not kicking.  He's not kicking.  He's not kicking.  He's not kicking.  He's not kicking.  He's not kicking.  He's not kicking.  He's not kicking.  He's not kicking.  Oh, he just buckled over.  He just doubled over in pain. 
[01:30]
 He's breathing really heavy.  I have never seen anything like this.  He's lining up again.  Oh, he's flinching.  Alright, Paul is still on his knees and Ellen's gonna start kicking now.  She's been done wrong by a lot of guys.  Here she goes.  She's lining up.  Paul goes, you didn't even make me flinch. 
[02:00]
 And then she went for it.  He's flinching now at the drop of a hat.  Oh, that was a good one.  That he almost fell over.  Look, he's ready to wolf I think.  You alright, Paul?  I just hope I get a seat on the subway.  Are we ready for contest at number two?  I'm a little scared.  I'm ready.  Alright, I guess we're ready for more of this.  I would miss this for the world. 
[02:30]
 I'm gonna need some water soon.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Spike actually hit his heart.  Oh, my God. 
[03:00]
 Oh, my...  Oh, my God.  I can't think anymore.  That was a bad one.  I can't think anymore.  That's a flash.  Is that me or the camera? 
[03:30]
 I see light.  That's gotta be it.  That's gotta be it.  That's gotta be it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  This isn't right.  I got a shot of that on the video. 
[04:00]
 That will make you cringe.  Alright, let's see if we can't get a good kick in from Grandma.  Grandma is lining up.  She just gave a three-quick shot.  She gave a three-quick.  Grandma gave a three.  Alright, hold on, Grandma.  How are you holding up?  I'm not.  I'm with Grandma.  Yeah, that's pretty good. 
[04:30]
 You missed, Grandma.  He's down.  He's down.  You don't talk Grandma like that.  Grandma's a good shot.  She got the bulls eye.  Grandma still got a chance, right?  Let's hear it for Grandma.  Grandma put him down.  God, did she line up and kick him.  Someone's gotta put a stop to this. 
[05:00]
 This is just not right.  It's really not right.  We must say, because we have a lot of ladies that listen to us, ladies, not all guys enjoy this.  It's a freefall of masculinity.  Oh, surely.  I'm gonna be a pussy.  I've found my limit. </pre>
