<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with Jim Norton, engaging in crude and sexually suggestive banter.  This segued into a discussion of wildly inaccurate predictions from a 1950s *Popular Mechanics* article about the year 2000, mocking projections like flying cars and $5,000 houses.  The impracticality of flying cars and three-dimensional air traffic control was debated at length.  A significant portion detailed Anthony's graphic and extremely detailed account of a severe hangover and vomiting episode from the previous day's show, triggered by a staffer's ("Sergeant Magoo") consumption of spoiled milk.  The hosts described the sounds and smells in vivid detail, and even admitted to attempts to worsen his condition.

The show included listener calls and announced upcoming guests Ron Jeremy and Brian Regan.  A prank involving a banner reading "Tyra Banks is a fatty pig fatty" placed outside Tyra Banks' show was discussed, with audio clips from her show about flatulence played for comedic effect.  The show returned to mocking the *Popular Mechanics* article, further highlighting its absurd predictions about future technology and society.  This section also included a humorous look at other famously inaccurate predictions about technology, such as IBM's assessment of the computer market and Western Union's view of the telephone.

Anthony's hangover was revisited, attributing it to a late-night poker game and drinking. The broadcast then included audio clips of a viral video of a staff member, E-Rock, undergoing a painful waxing, encouraging listeners to view it online. Fan-made edits of this audio, including one set to a *Star Wars* clip, were discussed.  A news story about a former NBA player coming out as gay prompted discussion about the surprisingly low media coverage, followed by a lengthy conversation on the popularity of fantasy football compared to other sports. A story about a woman attempting to kill her husband with wasps in his truck led to a humorous contrast between the idyllic image of weddings and subsequent marital discord, playing wedding songs interspersed with listener stories of marital strife.

Ron Jeremy and Brian Regan then appeared as in-studio guests. Ron Jeremy's segment covered details from his book, "Hardest Man in Showbiz," focusing extensively on a pornographic film allegedly shot in Howard Stern's radio studio, including graphic details about the production and Stern's reaction.  He also recounted making a porno in a radio studio wearing a Gene Simmons mask and using a microphone, reviewed an old Swedish porn film detailing specific scenes and comparing older and newer pornography,  and mentioned Dennis Hopper's reaction to his Woodstock appearance.

Brian Regan's segment discussed his stand-up career, including casino performances, views on gambling, and Las Vegas anecdotes.  The conversation touched upon fantasy football, vague sports injury reports, and bizarre political advertisements, with examples of misleading claims played for comedic effect.  Heckling in stand-up, the Michael Richards incident, and broadcasting censorship were also discussed.

A later segment opened with an anecdote about oral and anal sex, followed by a call from Brian, who had a medical emergency and needed to take an urgent call,  before shifting to details of his elaborate swimming pool construction.  A comedic bit involved a listener's remix of Paul R. Nelson's name repeatedly being said.  The hosts recounted their night out with Brian Regan, which involved significant milkshake and alcohol consumption.  Listener-created audio edits of E-Rock's waxing continued, including sexually explicit and violent content, leading to discussion about censorship and potential restrictions on the show. The cancellation of "So Your Pussy's Got Talent" was attributed to a listener's death and ensuing legal issues. Nancy Pelosi's request for a larger airplane was criticized, and the hosts discussed various aspects of pop culture and media, including MTV, VH1, and "The Insider." Listener calls complained about MTV's lack of music and suggested a "Ramone" call-based show and a best cover song ranking segment.  The segment ended with more listener-created audio edits and ringtones.

A segment featuring in-studio guest Earl, who did daily Black History Month segments on another show,  included discussions of his segment choices, which were mocked by the hosts.  The conversation became increasingly vulgar and racially charged, with jokes about sex, drugs, and Elvis Presley allegedly stealing from Black artists. Numerous offensive racial remarks were made.  This segued into a discussion of top cover songs, peppered with more racially charged comments and vulgar language. The segment concluded with a recording of a man yelling at his cat and the announcement of the "Line of the Day" contest, featuring highly offensive and racist entries.  The final moments involved logistical discussions about the show's ending, upcoming shows, and post-production tasks.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Obi and Anthony.  I want to throw up with failures.  The most annoying thing on two legs.  What a bore fest.  Who cares about the funny?  Just bring me the porn.  Aren't we dumb?  We hate.  Obi.  Oh, do you want to play?  Anthony.  I will beat children about the head.  Jim Norton.  I'm dancing.  I'm dancing.  I'm just, I'm a naked whore.  It's indescribable.  I'm trying.  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance.  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for.  Why are you crying?  The virus finally hit him. 
[00:00:30]  Well, with Jimmy, you never know.  It could be AIDS.  No.  Yes.  Yes.  It's the Obi and Anthony show.  The virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. today.  And.  I hate you.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Razzle-dazzle. 
[00:01:00]  Razzle-dazzle.  The Negro.  Who is your daddy and what does he do?  Now we are going to do something extremely fun.  Marijuana is the bomb.  Hi.  How are you? 
[00:01:30]  What are you people?  On dope?  Go ahead.  Stretch.  Everyone stretch.  Ah.  Ah.  Stretch.  One.  Two.  Three.  Stretch.  One.  Two.  Three. 
[00:02:00]  Palisthenics.  What is this?  1955?  Might as well do that too because radio is going back to 1955.  Stretch.  One.  Two.  Three.  Palisthenics every day.  That'll help.  This reinventing yourself stinks.  Reinvention.  You actually got to try and stop.  No phoning it in. 
[00:02:30]  Over the wireless.  Stretch.  One.  Two.  Three.  We got to get in awkward looking bathing suits and throw big beach balls at each other.  Yeah.  Do that kind of German exercises.  Our ancestors were just stupid.  Yeah.  Dumb.  Uninformed.  Couldn't figure things out.  Couldn't build anything that made sense.  The A-bomb.  Yeah, but you look at some of these old inventions though.  Like the old cars and stuff. 
[00:03:00]  They don't even look practical.  It's like, why couldn't they figure out like a car that was a lot smoother right away?  See the USA in your Chevrolet.  It was, yeah, they thought it was really good to have fins on your car.  Well, that was a little better.  I'm going back to like where it was just like a big, huge box.  Cars.  It was like a model T.  It was like a rectangle and a box.  No design whatsoever.  I think they pretty much took it from an old like horse-drawn wagon. 
[00:03:30]  That's exactly what they did.  And just grew up the new internal combustion engine.  Yeah, but why couldn't they figure out a better invention right off the bat?  Yeah, aerodynamics.  I don't think they were into that.  Or something.  Something that made a little more sense.  Sleeker and smoother.  Because even in the 50s when they tried to go sleek and smooth, it's nothing like it is now.  Right.  You know, where you get all the good aerodynamics and ground effects and stuff.  They thought just by, you know, airplanes have fins. 
[00:04:00]  If cars have fins, it will glide through the air.  Will it?  Really?  As they put a huge 10-cylinder monster motors in there.  I think we're going to talk about inventions today.  Little inventions.  Or things we were supposed to have by the year 2000.  Yeah.  And we're seven years past that now.  And nothing.  Still nothing.  It's disappointing.  Although you do do a little of that reading and you learn a lot.  Uh-oh.  Read.  Feeling the static already.  No. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, boy.  Yesterday's show ended with, uh, with, uh...  You're pretty much getting electrocuted.  Yeah, well...  It was wonderful.  I hope you got tased.  That's good for me, though.  A little shock therapy never hurt me.  Um, but if you do some of that reading, you do learn that we are moving forward.  Yeah.  It's more information than, um, than, like, hardware, I think, though.  I think that's what it is.  We're getting more, um, like, uh, the computer, of course, has just opened everything up.  But, um, I want the cool inventions that we were promised. 
[00:05:00]  The flying cars, I know.  The flying car is big.  There's no way to keep it organized, though.  No.  It's never going to happen.  You need to organize people.  People can't drive in two dimensions.  Right.  You can't expect them to pick up that whole three-dimensional driving thing.  You can't, like, uh, jump in your flying car in, let's say, Huntington on Long Island.  Right.  And decide you're going to fly into the city.  Yeah, what road do you take?  What road do you take?  Will there be roads all stacked up? 
[00:05:30]  Right.  And then when you've got to get off an exit, you're going to get off and then come down  on top of somebody, you know.  And where is everyone supposed to land at the same time?  Yeah.  What about, like, parking garages for all these flying cars?  And, you know, you're afraid someone's going to bump your door.  We will never see flying cars.  It's just not practical.  Think of flying buses.  Unless you get-  Called airplanes.  Huh?  You got flying buses.  They're called airplanes.  No, that's true, I guess.  But the individual flying car, I don't know. 
[00:06:00]  No, no.  I doubt it.  You may need all that space and highways to build houses.  They may have to build flying cars.  Oh, stupid houses.  Enough.  Enough of the immigration.  I just like contributing that.  That's very good.  Yeah, I guess Travis was looking through an old 1950s copy of Popular Mechanics, and they  had a whole thing on what to expect in the next 50 years up to the year 2000.  And, boy, did they just swing and a miss. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, man.  Swing and a miss.  It was that whole 50s ideology taken to the year 2000, instead of how it just kind of  slowly progresses up to that point.  When you think of what the future is going to be, it's a completely different picture  than it kind of mutates into once you get there.  Yeah, well, he's going through the article.  He was reading some of that to us during the prep session of the O.P. and Anthony show.  Yes.  Uh, it seemed like it was a joke article, but that was a real article? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, those are things I think they completely expected to happen.  Rocket ships that got you from New York to California in two hours?  In two hours.  That old gag?  Not airplanes, but rocket ships.  I read an article recently about that, where they're working on, what, aircraft that goes  pretty much straight up in the air, waits for the rotation of the Earth, and it comes  back down.  Yeah, that was another biggie.  Just stop already.  They keep talking about these planes, uh, every few months, popular mechanics will have 
[00:07:30]  a cover story on that.  Yeah.  You know, uh, New York to Japan in an hour?  In 43 minutes?  It's like, oh, okay, and it goes up into space, and I don't know if I want to go up into space.  No, I don't need to go.  I don't fly.  Just make the trip more comfortable.  I'll sit there a few hours, but, um, the whole space thing, and especially in the 50s  when they had this plan, it was probably one of those stupid sci-fi spaceship looking things  with all that unnecessary headroom.  They would put them in these rocket ships, and they'd sit down, and the set in the movie 
[00:08:00]  was like, from the top of the people's heads sitting in their chair to the top of the rocket  ship, there were like these steel beams everywhere, and you had like 20 feet.  Well, that's kind of usable space, isn't it?  That's why I could never watch Star Trek and all those, uh, space shows.  It took me out of it.  I'm like, there's no way you could have this much room in a spacecraft.  Like, you would utilize that headroom.  Right.  You look at the shuttle and the International Space Station, they don't have 20-foot  cathedral ceilings in these places. 
[00:08:30]  There's stuff that's got to be put in there.  They've got like four inches of headroom when they're sitting down.  Yeah, they're banging their heads on things, they're crawling through little tunnels, because  it takes a lot of stuff to make those things work.  But in Star Trek, they could all do calisthenics and stuff.  Oh, stop.  Engineering in the Enterprise was, the empty space took up more room than the stuff that  made the ship work.  Right, right.  And they'd just walk around and turn a few knobs and look at lights, and that was fine. 
[00:09:00]  The ship was working perfectly.  Well, let's talk about the super train.  It's Rich in New York.  What's up, Rich?  Rich?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Tell us about the future and this super train.  Oh, come on, guys.  You know, in Asia, they got that train that goes like 200 miles per hour.  That's impossible, Rich.  Everybody knows if man attains a speed greater than 30 miles per hour, he will surely perish.  I actually used to say that. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  That people couldn't do more than 30 miles an hour because the forces on their body would  kill them.  They didn't know what would happen.  30.  Oh, what, like G-Force?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't even know about that.  I think they thought spirits would enter your body.  Something stupid.  It couldn't be something as, like, realistic as G-Forces or something.  Once you do 30, spirits of the dead get jealous and will kill you.  Will they?  You know what?  You'd think we'd be further along the way because, you know, think about it. 
[00:10:00]  Most of the rules of physics and, like, even Einstein, these smart people, you'd think  they'd have, like, what we think to hovercraft.  You know, something, I don't know.  Some kind of way.  What about a...  Let's be realistic with the flying car.  It would never work.  We can't even get people to drive on roads right.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  That's why that'll never work.  You got to take the people out of the equation.  It takes 20 years to get one lane built on a highway.  I mean, how are they going to construct some type of airway for people?  Ain't going to happen. 
[00:10:30]  No, you're right.  Not in our lifetime.  Why can't they make a little platform that defeats gravity?  Like, that seems like something that could maybe be done in some way, shape, or form.  And I don't mean some kind of stupid magnet thing that gives the illusion that it's faking out.  Yeah, magnets are going to take over the world soon.  You think magnets are the big...  It's going to be all about magnets.  All about the magnets.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  I'll keep my eye out for that.  Popular Opie magazine.  It's all about the magnet. 
[00:11:00]  Big graphic on the...  You watch.  Opie holding a magnet.  You watch.  It's going to be all about the magnets.  It's going to be a horseshoe magnet, too.  You know, one of those oldie-style cartoon ones.  That's how they get the trains to go faster.  And they're just at the beginning of the new...  Magnets.  Magnet technology.  I saw an article in Popular Mechanics where they were talking about magnets and the magnet rails.  Yeah.  Where they actually have a bunch of magnets.  And they're in a big line.  And what they do is they turn on one magnet and then turn it off. 
[00:11:30]  And right when it turns off, the next magnet in front of it turns on.  And it repeats doing that.  And it drags something, like a train, down this track just using the magnetic pull of that.  And it could be really fast because they could turn on and off those magnets like in fractions of a second.  So, it pulls it along pretty quickly.  Then somebody's got to come up with a harebrained idea to build on that.  They thought for a spacecraft, what you would do is because every action has an equal and opposite reaction, you take the metal asteroid. 
[00:12:00]  You take a metal asteroid.  You land people on it.  Build some kind of little base on there.  And then build this magnet thing that takes chunks of this asteroid and launches it into space.  And because in space, when you launch that piece of metal out the back end of the asteroid, the asteroid will be propelled forward.  So, you are using an entire asteroid as a spaceship to get somewhere using the asteroid's metal being launched off as fuel to get you somewhere. 
[00:12:30]  So, by the time you get somewhere, you don't have an asteroid left and you're at your destination.  Right, sure.  It's like you need a big enough metal asteroid.  But, like, it's like, stop it.  Just stop.  What year is this happening?  We haven't even come back to the moon yet.  We just get gas.  It's just gas.  In space with gasoline.  Let's say hi to Dan in St. Louis.  That's great.  Could you top me off?  I'm going to Jupiter. 
[00:13:00]  Hey, Dan, what's up?  I saw Scientific American from 1950.  There's all this stupid shit in there.  And then Isaac Asimov predicted the internet.  Huh?  What was that?  We missed it.  Isaac Asimov predicted the internet in 1950.  What type of internet did he predict, though?  Because some people say the internet was predicted in the 50s.  And then you read a synopsis of it and it's nothing like the internet is.  Well, it's like that article you were saying.  It had all this stupid shit.  But then he goes, you know, I said...  Oh, God, Dan, stop cursing, please. 
[00:13:30]  You know, no one's hearing what you're saying.  At this point, you've got to be educated enough not to curse so people can hear you on the radio.  Please.  And it really has nothing to do with the conversation.  There are times where that word is completely appropriate and we would love to use it.  But you're just throwing it in.  When you use it like the word the, it's not helping anybody.  But they had all these stupid ideas that were just bizarre like you're talking about.  And then Isaac Asimov comes in.  Well, I think we'll have all our computers linked up into one organizing network all over the world.  So, I guess you got it right. 
[00:14:00]  Hey, Inbred from Pennsylvania, what's going on?  You're on the O.P.  Anthony, Sharon.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I think the great thing is that we're supposed to have these crazy rocket ships that will get us across the country in a matter of minutes.  Yet, in reality, our astronauts are driving 900 miles in diapers.  Yeah, it drives you a little crazy, maybe.  How great is that story, man?  The front page of the Daily News.  Hussy from Houston.  Hussy. 
[00:14:30]  Disgraced astronaut blame for breaking family's heart.  Aw.  She is a kook.  They're starting to say she's Amy Fisher all over again.  Really?  Another Amy Fisher type.  Well, she really didn't have a good plan just to kind of mace her and then hit her with a mallet.  Was that what she was going to do?  Hit her with like she's a crab?  Like she's a little crab that you're trying to get the meat out of the leg?  What do you do with a mallet?  You play whack-a-mole.  Yeah.  You break open crabs. 
[00:15:00]  And that's pretty much it.  And hit bitches over the head with it.  And hit the bitch over the head that's got your man.  Unbelievable, though.  And she was, yeah, she was an astronaut.  For whatever that means these days.  I don't know.  You don't know your astronauts these days.  You folks are here on a special night.  And thank you very much for showing up.  The entire balcony at the Ed Sullivan Theater tonight is filled with deranged, lovesick astronauts.  She was in court today and the judge let her go free on bail.  On bail?  Talk about a flight risk.  She's an astronaut.  She could leave the planet. 
[00:15:30]  She could be on Mars by tomorrow.  After hearing about it, NASA officials said,  we may need to add a new question to the astronaut entrance exam.  Thank God the kidnapping attempt failed.  And of course it failed.  I mean, let's face it, she's no rocket scientist.  Well, they're having a lot of fun.  Oh, they certainly are.  They're having a lot of fun with that doozy.  All right, let's say hi to Andrew all the way out there in California.  Andrew, what's going on?  Andrew. 
[00:16:00]  Hey.  The Knights of St. Andrews gave me this jacket.  They called it golf without the L.  Go ahead, Andrew.  What's up, Andrew?  Are you, is Anthony doing okay?  Yeah, if you were listening to the program yesterday, Andrew, yeah, Anthony was a little  under the weather.  I was okay for the FM portion of the program, for the broadcast.  Oh, yeah, we should update everybody.  Yeah.  You got through the FM portion pretty well.  Yeah, right toward the end, though, it was looking grim.  The walkover did not help.  And then once I got over to the XM portion of the program, I fell apart. 
[00:16:30]  It was over, Johnny.  No, no, no.  Opie and Jimmy decided to break you and ruin the show.  Yeah, I might have been able to...  No, we broke you.  ...be there, but it worked out for the best because I would have been completely useless  sitting there.  I had nothing.  We broke you like a bronco.  Anthony had a poker game Tuesday night with some fans and some old pals and stayed up  way too late and drank maybe a little too much.  The beers were flowing and, you know, when you're drinking beer, especially, you don't 
[00:17:00]  go, you know, maybe I'm having too much.  Because you're playing poker, it's fun, you're not like falling down drunk, but then I woke  up and felt like crap.  Well, you never really slept, though.  Yeah, and that was another thing.  If you went to bed at 2, 2.30 and you're getting up at 4.15, that's really not sleeping.  A couple of hours.  So you made it through the FM portion of the show, and then by the time we got over to  XM, his color changed and he was not doing well. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, it was a mess.  So Jimmy and I and the rest of the gang decided to break you.  We decided to break you.  We started talking about all sorts of awful stuff you don't want to hear about when you're  very, very hungover.  They brought over turkey, gravy, soda, and Jimmy started eating.  Here's the worst thing.  When I'm on the verge of throwing up from a hangover, if I smell food, it's over.  And Jimmy brought in, what was it, you got an egg salad? 
[00:18:00]  No, no, I kept saying egg salad because that's gross, but in reality it was turkey on rye.  Turkey on wheat with lettuce, tomato, and mustard.  It didn't even matter because it was this strong smell of food, so that hit me.  And then you guys just would not let up, and the worst was Magoo.  Yeah, well, we were describing a lot of very, very greasy things you would eat when you're  hungover.  And then, yes, Sergeant Magoo, one of the ONA pests, he came in, and we just happened to  find some milk that was in the fridge. 
[00:18:30]  Sour milk.  That was well over a month past its date.  There were clumps in it, and Magoo started chugging it and gargling it, and then he attempted  to try to puke it up, and he couldn't.  He couldn't, which is just amazing to me.  But that was gross, too, because he kept putting his fingers down his throat to vomit, and  he would make the blah, blah sounds, and then have slime on his fingers.  Yeah.  That kind of grossed me out, but believe it or not, it wasn't what put me over. 
[00:19:00]  I'll tell you exactly the moment that put me over.  Not the other stuff, like the puke sound effects, the baby crying.  The puke sound effects.  Me and Jimmy just screaming into the microphones.  The puke sound effects and the screaming hurt my head because I had a pounder.  I had a pounding headache.  Yeah.  But what got me to actually puke.  Jimmy?  What?  When he pulled his pants down?  No, that's sexy.  No, Jimmy kept pulling his pants down and then bending over. 
[00:19:30]  I saw things that a man should not see.  Unless you play in the NBA.  Oh, wow.  But, again, that wasn't what made me sick.  It was the pizza talk.  You guys started talking about the greasy pizza.  Pepperoni pizza that was coming in.  Yeah, okay.  And you guys are talking about I was trying to hold back, and then Than said something about the greasy pepperoni pizza.  And right after you said something, I can't remember what it was, but you kind of described it. 
[00:20:00]  And I felt that wash come over you, the nausea, and then, like, okay, here it comes.  It's over, Johnny.  There's no getting away from this.  And I had to run to the bathroom.  You didn't run to the bathroom.  I didn't run.  It was this calculated.  You shuffled to the bathroom like an old man.  And then I looked at it.  Who are you kidding?  I looked for the key, and it wasn't there.  Yeah.  So then I'm like, I looked in production for a garbage pail, because I was losing it.  And I was able to wait it out just long enough to get a key. 
[00:20:30]  Went in there, and, of course, I hear people by the door.  What?  What?  With the microphone.  So I knew.  So every time I chucked, I flushed the ball to try to.  Yeah, Anthony has.  So he wouldn't hear me going.  Anthony has very bizarre bathroom habits.  Only when there's a mic on me.  No.  I don't do it at home.  At home, I let it fly.  There was another.  Actually, yeah, this didn't make the radio, but I think I was in the bathroom with you  at the same time or whatever, and you were doing what you have to do, but you were flushing  as you were doing it, which was so bizarre to me. 
[00:21:00]  I don't like the stench.  Once things are done, like the second it's done, and you have a splashdown, as they call  it in the space industry.  Splashdown, flush.  And then flush.  Yeah.  Just get it out of there.  It doesn't have to sit there.  I've never heard of that before.  Get it out of there.  Send it on its way.  And as far as, you know...  Do you like sitting at an airport waiting for your plane?  You think that thing wants to sit there?  Send it on its way down to its friend.  It's just kind of weird to send it on its way like he does before he's done. 
[00:21:30]  He was scarred as a child.  I'm telling you what happened.  Yeah.  He was a little...  When it was little Anthony, he did something in the bathroom that should have been figured  out in a Quincy episode, and right after the girl he likes walked in and made a comment,  or a girl he had a crush on made a comment about how stinky Anthony was.  You know, I might say that's a viable little scenario, but I've always been like this as  far back as I can remember.  I mean, in like kindergarten, it probably happens.  I mean, no, no, I have no recollection of anything like that. 
[00:22:00]  I just...  Send it on its way?  Why sit over it?  Why sit there with it a mere few inches from you?  Once it leaves your body, it is disgusting and should be rid of...  People just do, though.  Yeah, I know.  You're trying to turn everyone around.  You're like part of a minority, a minute minority.  Also, here's another reason, and I hope I can do my best to describe this. 
[00:22:30]  You can be done with, I will call it, phase one of the operation.  Phase one, okay.  In a multi-phase operation.  Gotcha.  So you're done with phase one.  Now, when phase two starts coming about...  I'm with you.  Sometimes phase two will do this notorious thing called splashback.  Okay?  You with me?  You don't want the water that is sitting there with that in it splashing up on you. 
[00:23:00]  But no one thinks this much.  I do.  No one thinks this much.  That's my job.  No one thinks this much.  You don't want that dirty water that has that in it to then splash back on you.  But it's so weird because I heard it for myself.  Let's say you have four stages.  Yeah.  Stage one, done.  Flush.  Stage two, done.  Flush.  Stage three, done.  Flush.  Stage four, done.  Flush.  Yeah.  And then one last flush to make sure everything has been flushed.  Well, then you got to flush because you got to clean up. 
[00:23:30]  But anyway, getting back to yesterday.  So when you were puking, same thing was happening.  You had a few stages of that, but you were flushing after every stage.  I was constantly flushing because just seeing it will make me more sick.  My logic is to keep it all there because it helps you get through all the stages.  Helps you along.  Helps you.  How is that?  What is it, talking to you?  It's not a pleasant thing visually or this way. 
[00:24:00]  Well, I'm talking about like the vomit.  Yeah.  That's one thing.  Yeah, no, no.  I got to get that out of there as it's happening.  I say you leave it because it helps you with the rest of the stages that you're going to go.  No.  Because it's not a pleasant experience anyway, and you want to get it over as soon as possible.  You're right.  I want to get it over as soon as possible, but I'm not going to like sit there because  that will unnecessarily make me puke more.  Yeah, all right.  Just seeing it.  I can't see it.  I don't want to smell it.  I don't want to look.  Boom.  It's gone, gone, gone, gone.  But ants feel much better today.  Oh, 100%.  Everyone's asking for the puke audio because it's very rare when you allow us into your personal 
[00:24:30]  life like you did yesterday.  You had no choice.  We pretty much knocked the door down to get mics.  I was at your mercy because I was powerless to do anything.  I was weak.  I was like a concentration camp victim.  I had no power.  I could do nothing.  We had a pepperoni pizza on the way, too.  It was too early to get one.  We really wanted to open one of those ovens.  You know what?  Order one today.  I'll have a slice or two with you.  Hey, if the boys are listening at the other joint, we really need some of this audio for 
[00:25:00]  today.  Just little snippets of Jimmy and I trying to get you to puke and then finally get old  and puking, okay?  I was trying to get some air out of the window and it was just too cold out.  And then I left the studio.  I was just walking around hoping I could walk it off.  And then Sergeant Magoo was drinking rancid milk in front of me.  There was nowhere to go.  I was trapped in this puke factory.  Jimmy is opening up parts of his body.  We're showing you horrific pictures.  Just eating things.  We had pictures of Tub Girl for Anthony to look at. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, the Tub Girl pictures.  We had a picture of Rich Voss and just some nasty thing that came out of his own nose.  That was something I couldn't look at either.  That was unbelievable.  And we finally got the job done, huh?  Anthony was dottering.  I was.  And then you finally got me.  You finally got me.  And that was the end of the show.  All right.  Hopefully we'll have some audio of that a little later on.  Also today, Ron Jeremy stopping by to say hi.  An old friend.  Also another old friend, Brian Regan.  Brian's coming in today. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, Brian will be here.  We always do this to him, too.  He's trying to be like the.  He is the clean comic, obviously.  And then we just throw him in.  We just throw him into the filth.  Ron Jeremy and Brian Regan walking through that door at the exact same time.  Polar opposites.  Polar opposites.  It'll work, though.  Yeah.  All right.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and Live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe. 
[00:26:30]  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  The O.P. and Anthony virus.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  Our phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  If you got anything for the program, give us a call.  Yeah.  We were just talking about magazines really fast just before we got back from break.  And I guess we're in the latest FHM magazine.  It's a follow-up.  A follow-up.  Well, they did a huge feature on us for Thanksgiving.  And they had us wearing very, very, very ugly, awful sweaters as part of the picture. 
[00:27:00]  Yep.  It was basically Anthony and I serving Thanksgiving to our comedian friends.  And, you know, the gag was to get everyone in really awful sweaters.  So, FHM and the latest issue, the March issue, March 2007, they're having a little contest.  But, unfortunately, this is the last issue for FHM.  So, what?  They're going to run this contest online or something?  Yeah.  I mean, they're still going to have their websites up.  And it's still going to be printed in the U.K. 
[00:27:30]  But the U.S. publication of FHM is gone.  It's gone.  Basically, they're looking for you and a picture of you in a really, really awful sweater.  And then they're going to get the best ones online and vote on it.  And then, I don't know, give them a trip away or something.  Maybe that's why they're out of business.  Because they considered that to be like a really interesting contest.  Yeah.  Well, it was supposed to be a really big deal for us.  But then the magazine went away.  And now it's like, well, they promised people this.  So, they're going to do the contest online.  But the March issue has a little blurb on it.  It has a little tiny, tiny, God, I think this picture is smaller than a postage stamp of Anthony and I in our ugly sweaters. 
[00:28:00]  Opie and Anthony's Thanksgiving dinner in the December issue featured some truly hideous sweaters, writes John Rose of Hoboken, New Jersey.  But none of them are as ugly as the one grandma got me.  I dare anyone to top this wool atrocity.  And then they ask, is there a horrendous holiday knit buried in your closet that can top this one?  Send photos of your sweatered self to letters at FHMUS.com. 
[00:28:30]  The owner of the Ugliest Garb will be flown to New York City to meet Opie and Anthony?  How about that?  When were they going to tell us?  That would have been nice to inform us.  In their XM studio.  Three runners up will score this XM radio with a free one-year subscription.  For official rules, go to FHMUS.com slash win.  You don't have to say backslash.  Wow.  It's a backslash.  There's a picture of that guy's sweater.  Yeah.  He's wearing it. 
[00:29:00]  That is an awful sweater.  Mm-hmm.  Looks like some kind of Indian blanket.  Yeah.  But FHM's going away.  The last issue is on newsstands now, and I was telling these guys, all these magazines are slowly but surely going away because back in the day, these magazines were websites.  Yeah.  Like what you see when you pick up an FHM or a Maxim or a Stuff magazine, now there's websites dedicated to all that stuff.  There's no real reason to go to a newsstand and pick up some of these magazines anymore. 
[00:29:30]  And they don't have anything sex.  I mean, to me, most of them, I hate them.  Like, Penthouse is trying to do it now, and it's abysmal because you can get complete nudity online.  You don't need to see someone in a bikini or some cute little snippet.  They're all little snippets.  Little sexy.  Little funny snippets.  Keep some of the mystique in there.  Yeah.  Just little funny guy at the office humor crap.  Just stinks.  Yeah.  That's interesting, though, that websites were the – or magazines were the websites of the past.  That's basically what it was.  You'd pick it up if you wanted a subject like science, you know, or something a little saucy. 
[00:30:00]  Nudity.  Yeah, nudity.  Sports.  You'd get Penthouse, and there were different degrees, you know.  You could get Playboy for your classy nudity, or you'd get swank.  And now you just go to various websites and get whatever you want there.  So the magazines are really having trouble subscribing.  Who likes subscribes to – I do, though.  One magazine.  Which one?  Popular mechanics.  It makes good toilet bowl reading. 
[00:30:30]  No one makes good toilet bowl reading.  Us Weekly.  See, that's another one that probably does very well because you need to have a magazine that has a lot of little things in it.  Like, I can't imagine subscribing to Time where you have to sit there and pretty much commit to reading an entire article about something on the bowl.  Because that's where people do their reading, I think, magazine reading especially.  I read Time magazine and Newsweek every once in a while, but it makes you feel like you're reading something for school. 
[00:31:00]  It's just written really, yeah.  Like, you start reading this stuff, and it's kind of interesting, but then you get all that feeling like, oh, God, I'm going to be tested on this.  When's the test?  When's the pop quiz?  You start panicking.  It just feels like school when you read those magazines.  And again, that kind of stuff, you just get online.  Anything that's in there, you can pretty much get online.  Why bother?  But if you're sitting for a little while, you need something quick. 
[00:31:30]  So you want us, something like that?  Oh, let me read, what's Brittany up to?  I should be done by then, by the time I finish this one.  Or, hey, how does that piece of aircraft work?  That's it.  Let me just read that, and oh, I'm done.  Goes right back behind you on the tank, and you go about your business.  Until next time.  Until next time.  Hey, really fast.  This will lead to something, but just in case you weren't listening yesterday, we're going to do this one last time,  and then we're going to kind of move on from the Tyra Banks thing.  But we were on a mission, and the pests out west. 
[00:32:00]  The pests out west.  P-O-Ws.  The P-O-Ws, the O&A Pests, they got a sign outside that studio that Tyra Banks does her fine TV show.  Fine.  Her Oprah Winfrey wannabe TV show.  Basically, the sign read, Tyra is a fatty pig fatty.  Fatty pig fatty.  And we made the Daily Ten on E!, which was quite an accomplishment for the Oprah Winfrey Anthony show. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, saw that.  They gave us a couple of jabs, but like you said, I think they liked us.  And I was very, very surprised that I said I would pay $500.  Yeah, you certainly didn't want to hear that.  No.  On tape.  I was so excited, too, because I heard in advance, well, heard in advance, they called us,  and they were looking for audio and pictures and stuff.  You know, I knew we were going to be on, so I couldn't wait, and I'm watching the thing, and I'm all excited.  And Jimmy throws out the, I will pay $500 for the person that gets, you know, Tyra is a fat pig or whatever on TV. 
[00:33:00]  And then I seconded.  I'm like, what?  Crazy, man.  It must have been under cold medicine or something.  Yeah.  I don't remember saying that.  No, I didn't say it only on TV.  I was like, where she had to see it, Latifah.  Oh, right, right, right, right.  That was the one with the CBS sign.  Well, I mean, she pretty much had to walk right by the sign.  She saw it.  So, just in case you missed it, here it is for the last time.  While Tyra Banks caught a fair bit of comedic ridicule on the back end of her now infamous bathing suit episode of her daytime show,  I really hope she doesn't subscribe to XM Radio. 
[00:33:30]  At number eight, Tyra's swimsuit-clad on-air plea caught the attention of shock jock morning DJs Opie and Anthony,  who decided that Banks was right for their own brand of low-brow public humiliation.  I want her to see a sign that says, Tyra is a self-centered fat pig.  Yeah.  I'll pay $500.  Oh.  $500.  It makes the news I got another $500.  No problem.  Oh, man.  Pay up, boys. 
[00:34:00]  After issuing that challenge to their listeners, one group of fans calling themselves the POWs, or Pess Out West,  went so far as to put up a giant banner out front of CBS's LA studio, where Tyra's show tapes and it read,  Tyra Banks is a fatty pig fatty.  Very classy.  The insulting sign has since been taken down.  No word yet on what Tyra has to say about the stunt.  She subscribes to XM.  Isn't her awful show broadcast on XM?  Yeah, she pretty much has a show.  Yeah, she has a subscription. 
[00:34:30]  Or a simulcast on XM.  Who knows?  I'm sure she subscribes.  Who knows?  But that was a lot of fun when that happens for the radio show.  That is really great how you say it.  Yeah, and if it makes the news, another $500.  No problem.  And there it is.  And then, yeah, the other day when we found out that this was going on, I'm like, ha-ha.  I'm like pointing and laughing at Jimmy.  You've got to pay $500.  I swear to God, I had no clue that I said that.  So Kenny got my money, and it's off to Jewish Monkey, I believe.  Oh, you already sent it? 
[00:35:00]  Jewish Monkey gets it?  I don't mess around.  I've got to send mine.  I'm sorry, JM.  I'll make sure I send mine.  Good old Jewish Monkey got that done.  Money order?  No, check.  Personal?  Sure.  No, no, not my address on it.  Oh, okay.  That wouldn't be happening.  Watch out.  I'll give you my address right now.  It's 220.  Yeah?  I had to send a listener a check once, and I was like, you know something?  I better send him a corporate check, because I don't want him to know my address.  So he has our agent's address.  He's probably represented by Bob now. 
[00:35:30]  Anyway, I wonder if he stalked and killed Bob.  Stupid Bob.  Never saw it coming.  That would happen.  The nut had my address.  How did that happen?  All right.  Use the money I gave him to fund the whole thing.  We have a moment from Tyra's show yesterday, and then I think we're going to rest on the Tyra thing for a little bit.  Enough about Tyra.  Well, you know, we play these things out on the show, and then we move on to some other silliness.  But yesterday, I couldn't help but notice I was trolling. 
[00:36:00]  I've got to give him credit.  I was trolling Whackbag, and they've got a great clip of Tyra talking about farting.  Yep.  Just talking about farting on TV.  A little gas.  A little gas action.  And it was just completely ridiculous.  Why was she talking about this?  She was on with Janet Jackson.  And was it a subject that just came up, or was this something planned?  This is just how dumb she is.  She's just dumb.  She is.  She probably thinks she's talking about politics. 
[00:36:30]  She probably thinks that she's getting something done.  Rattling around in her head.  We learned some awful things about Tyra.  Really?  Yeah.  Not only does she not have self-control, she, well, doesn't have self-control.  I should have got one of these wacky whistles or something for that one.  Oh.  Or sound effects. 
[00:37:00]  That one's appropriate.  All right.  Here we go.  So Tyra, talking about her fart problem is what it comes down to.  Keep your friends close.  Keep your sound effects closer.  There you go.  Listen to this.  There we go.  Ready for this?  This is what makes for really good TV in the year 2007.  You're in a room.  Yes.  Okay?  Yes.  And you fart.  And it stinks so bad.  Kill. 
[00:37:30]  Do you own up to it?  Or do you go, mm, it stinks.  Damn, who did that?  No, no.  I'll own up to it for sure.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You own up to it.  No, you guys.  What is Tyra's demo?  Five to nine-year-olds?  Same as ours.  She's doing a little, yeah.  Isn't this stuff you used to talk about in, like, third grade?  No, you guys.  This is really embarrassing. 
[00:38:00]  But, you know, I'll own up to it.  Let me just stop there.  I'm going too far.  No, no.  Tell me.  You farted recently, Ann?  No, no.  They're laughing at me.  No, but I'll say, you guys, I have really bad gas.  Me too.  And they'll say, let it out, girl.  And you let it out.  Yes.  Yes.  Dirty panty party. 
[00:38:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Panty party!  Kiss my fat ass!  Kiss my fat ass! 
[00:39:00]  Yes, same audience.  Well, we've always said fart equals funny.  And Janet Jackson talking about how embarrassing it is.  Yeah.  Maybe she shouldn't be embarrassed by farts when you have a brother that loves sleeping with  children.  There's other things to be embarrassed about.  Yeah.  Your whole family is an embarrassment.  Yeah.  All right.  Wow.  Here's a little more audio.  Are they loud like trumpets? 
[00:39:30]  Are they silent and deadly?  I don't think they're as loud as Gil.  Oh, Gil?  Gil, you have loud fart.  Loud fart.  Well, Janet, I'm very gassy.  I have a, not a disease, but like a, I don't know what you call it.  This thing.  The carton disease.  It's called IBS.  It's called irritable bowel syndrome.  Ew.  Y'all know how far I'm in the makeup room.  She, she's like stinking out the makeup room.  Ew.  She's so self-important too.  You know, she just lets him go and doesn't care who's around. 
[00:40:00]  Tyra, lift your head up.  Okay.  Now look up with your eyes.  Look up.  I just want to put on a little.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  All right, Tyra.  We're going to powder your forehead.  Bring it back in the powder truck.  Oh.  Oh, Tyra.  Kiss my fat ass.  All right.  We'll make that up too.  Oh.  Oh.  Poor makeup guy. 
[00:40:30]  The hair is floating back.  That's got to be disgusting.  This irritable bowel.  And everybody has to make believe like it's cute.  Way to take this.  Oh, Tyra.  You did it again.  I'm thinking we should go with this segment that I am going to be a person on the street  that is in a fat suit. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, oops.  Oops.  Oh, Tyra.  She farts again.  I'm going to punch her in the face.  This room stinks.  Big smelly conference room with her just letting loose.  Here's what I want to do for the next show.  Right.  Guys, you know I can't help myself.  Help myself.  I got the IBS.  Fanny Porter.  Woo.  Well, here we go. 
[00:41:30]  This is just the last clip and it's just terrific.  Oh, you do?  All the time.  Is it funky?  You know, I feel like I can telegraph my fart.  Inside, I know if it's going to be funky or not.  You can just feel it.  So, like, if it's not going to be funky.  Why am I telling you this?  I can't.  You hear them laughing in the back.  If it's not going to be funky, I just let it out.  And if it is going to be funky, I'll let it out.  And I'll be like, dang, who did that?  What's that?  What's that?  What's that?  So you don't own up to it.  I don't own up to this thing. 
[00:42:00]  Ew.  She's got a sour stomach.  She's scared of signs in front of her studio.  She's trying to push out some courage.  What does that sign say?  Tyra Banks is a fatty pig fatty?  I'm scared. 
[00:42:30]  I love this one.  Wait for it.  Wait for it.  There it is.  Don't get it.  Not full.  Wait.  Wait.  It's done.  You know what that is?  You started by sitting down.  And then, you know, you just realized you've got to, like, stand up at the end.  Stand up.  Play it again.  You're sitting.  You're sitting.  You're sitting.  You're sitting.  Stand up.  That's what that one's all about. 
[00:43:00]  Here, play another one.  We'll try to figure it out.  Jimmy, help me along here.  Here.  Wow.  That sounded like popping those little plastic bubbles that you get, the packing material.  After that one, you're throwing clothing into the garbage.  Oh, no, this one. 
[00:43:30]  It's a nice one.  Yeah.  A lot of them.  Cancer patient.  This, I just don't understand.  That is, like, desert dry.  That's when you're on a plane and your ears haven't popped yet.  And there's ones that make no sense.  They're not even human.  That's like the alien.  Ebola.  That's good.  That's good. 
[00:44:00]  That kind of flattens out.  Yeah.  That's double layered.  And then...  Wait for it.  That one.  And then the final one.  Rocket propelled.  Into the future.  The future. 
[00:44:30]  All right.  Let's step aside.  Yeah, that sounds like...  That sounds like Donald Duck getting mad.  All right.  That's wonderful that she could be so open and free.  She's just a regular person like all of us.  Yeah.  Are we going to get to the Popular Mechanics thing from the 50s?  I hope so.  Yeah.  I want to talk about some of the inventions that we were supposed to have by now.  Maybe we could look forward to them in our future. 
[00:45:00]  Maybe they were a few years off.  Maybe it's 2010.  This will all show up.  And I'm hoping we get some audio of you getting sick.  I hope not.  Well, we have it.  We just got to get it over here.  So, yeah.  Whatever.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Jim Norton from the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, Angel.  Hi.  Hi.  This is Jim Norton.  I will be in Albany, February 9-10. 
[00:45:30]  That's this Friday, Saturday, at the Comedy Works.  Box office, 518-689-0490.  518-689-0490.  This Friday, Saturday, February 9-10.  The Comedy Works here in Albany.  For more info, visit eatablein.com.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:46:00]  All right.  Lots to do today.  We got Brian Regan coming in to say hi.  He hasn't been around in a while.  No.  Also, Ron Jeremy.  He's got a new book out, writing about his life.  Should be interesting.  Yeah, he did stand-up at that point.  He's a pretty interesting life.  And if you got something for the Opie and Anthony Show, give us a call.  1-866-313-FREE.  We have the bad predictions.  We got stuff we were supposed to be using or inventions, I guess. 
[00:46:30]  Things that were supposed to be commonplace in the year 2000, as per an article in Popular  Mechanics from 1950.  It was supposed to be like, you know, in the next 50 years, we'll see this happen.  And boy, they didn't quite have it down.  They kind of got close on a couple of things, but because of the day, they couldn't really  wrap their minds around certain things.  So they only had like what they could work with then and kind of think of that in the 
[00:47:00]  future.  Because they have one example that's almost like the internet.  Right.  But not quite.  They pretty much couldn't understand how to make things smaller.  Yeah.  Like the inner workings of machines to try to get those things smaller.  They couldn't really comprehend that back in 1950.  That's the problem.  To make it commonplace.  But we were talking about Star Trek earlier, and that stupid show is more accurate than  this. 
[00:47:30]  With things like the tricorder and the communicator.  Our communicators are better than stupid Star Treks.  Kirk always had problems with them.  He was losing the signal, and that was, you know, way in the future.  Sure was.  Never quite get him.  Twisting his little knobs.  His communicator nods, Scotty, Scotty.  I actually saw him tap it a few times, though, where he hit it.  Scotty.  Oh, man.  In the future, we got to tap stuff that doesn't work.  Tap things and turn dials, and they go, boo. 
[00:48:00]  It's all analog.  So here it is.  Miracles.  Miracles you'll see in the next 50 years from Popular Mechanics 1950.  Mm-hmm.  And the old year 2000 passed us by, and we didn't get any of this crap.  And where is this?  For example, towns are illuminated by electric suns.  Electric suns.  Suspended from arms on steel towers 200 feet high.  So the whole town, you got these towers.  Yeah.  And there's pretty much nuclear reactions happening. 
[00:48:30]  Right.  And these suns will light up the town.  I guess instead of individual, what, streetlights and stuff?  Streetlights, things like that.  They decide, no, we'll just have a sun per town.  Yeah.  That'll illuminate the whole thing.  That didn't happen.  No.  No.  Mm-mm.  Some cooking is done by solar heat.  Is that, do we use solar energy to cook?  No.  Solar energy really took a back seat.  It was big in, like, the 70s. 
[00:49:00]  People were real like, that's going to be it.  Solar energy.  And, no, didn't quite take off.  But it is being used to power some of the shuttle and stuff like that.  So that was kind of accurate.  Yeah, but that was always, I mean, spacecraft, it always used some kind of solar panels.  You can't get batteries up there to change.  So they used solar panels.  But down here on Earth, please.  I kind of remember, too, in the 70s, like, some neighbor would always decide to put this  abomination on his roof that was big, like, water went through it. 
[00:49:30]  And the sun heated the water.  And he saved, like, pennies a month.  And it was just this huge mess on his roof.  Yeah.  Big square tank.  How about wood, brick, and stone are too expensive to use to build homes?  Because they assumed back then that wood, brick, and stone are just this archaic way of building things. 
[00:50:00]  Sure.  So there's got to be something better in the future.  No, we're still using that stuff.  Homes cost only $5,000 to make.  And would last only 25 years.  Nobody in 2000 sees any sense in building a house that would last a century.  That's kind of true.  Because you never know what neighborhood you might be building in.  Why build a house that would last a century when things like, oh, the Negro might move in next door? 
[00:50:30]  Well, you'll have to knock your house down.  These houses are disposable.  When too many undesirables move in, your house will instantly sense them and dissolve.  Don't worry.  A new house will immediately form in a nice, clean neighborhood.  A white neighborhood.  A white neighborhood.  Lily white with sidewalks of gold. 
[00:51:00]  And pale children playing in the street.  It's the 50s.  Where every home has a German shepherd and a fire hose.  Men will use depilatory to shave.  No razors for him.  He'll just put some cream on his face, wipe it off, be called faggot, and go to work.  No, we're still using razors. 
[00:51:30]  When a woman cleans the home, she simply turns on a hose.  Why not furniture, rugs, draperies, unscratchable floors, all made from synthetic fabrics or waterproof plastic?  After the water has run down a drain in the middle of the floor, she turns on a blast of hot air and dries everything.  Of course, the hot air could be hot and her friends just talking.  It's the 50s.  Smack her in the mouth.  And if you come home and she hasn't hosed down your house, it's time for the beating. 
[00:52:00]  And then off to the bedroom where she performs her wifely duties before cooking you dinner.  They really thought that was going to be possible in the year 2000?  You just hosed down your house to clean it?  Yeah, apparently everything, because they were so up on this, on plastics, that everything was made of plastic.  It was supposed to be all about plastic.  Yeah, so your rug, although it would look like a wool rug, is made of plastic. 
[00:52:30]  Pretty much astroturf in your living room with a drain in the floor.  Right.  And your couches and everything, everything in it is waterproof, so just hose it down.  This next one...  Hell, you live in a monkey cage?  You've got to hose down your living room?  This next one makes me think that this is just a goof article.  Yeah.  It says, discarded paper table linen and rayon underwear are bought by chemical factories...  Chemical factories...  Chemical factories!  ...to be converted into candy. 
[00:53:00]  That's right.  Mmm.  Depends on whose underwear it is.  Tasty chocolate treats.  What kind of underwear?  Rayon and linen, how is that turned into candy?  Yeah, this is the one we need more info on.  This can't be true.  It can't be true.  I don't know what is in linen or rayon that can be used by a chemical factory in making candy. 
[00:53:30]  Maybe someone just looked at it one day and thought, well, I'd like some chocolate and lemonade.  That's a tasty treat.  Might as well read Tyra's.  Anybody!  Oh, God!  Good for it.  We need more info on that one.  That just doesn't seem like it's a real one.  All right.  More on.  Here's a close one. 
[00:54:00]  Okay.  This one they got a little close, but because it was 1950, they just had what they had to work with.  But the television is connected with the telephone as well as the radio receiver.  So when talking to a friend in a distant city over the telephone, they could also see each other.  And shopping is also done by television.  Hey, look at that.  Hello.  One out of a hundred.  All right.  Hello, television.  I would like a pizza pie. 
[00:54:30]  Hello, television.  Get me some slacks.  Television, I need spats and shoes.  Why isn't my television shopping for me?  Or talking back to me.  Shopping is done by television.  A bunch of televisions pushing around shopping carts at a wall bombs.  Television, pick me up some oranges while you're out.  They didn't see that. 
[00:55:00]  But the idea of hooking your television up to your telephone and then using that as some kind of communication device,  that's all they had to work with, not knowing that the computer would be available to everybody.  But right now I'm sitting in front of PalTalk.  What am I doing?  I'm looking at people wired through not telephone, but cables.  And I could talk to them.  They could talk to us.  So they almost got that one right.  They almost got that.  Although the computer is the new television. 
[00:55:30]  True.  All right.  What else here?  I like this one.  It is easy enough to spot a budding hurricane.  In the doldrums off the coast of Africa.  Before it has a chance to gather much strength and speed as it travels westward toward Florida,  oil is spread over the sea and ignited.  There is an updraft.  Air from the surrounding region, which includes developing hurricanes, rushes in to fill the void.  The rising air condenses so that some of the water in the whirling mass falls as rain. 
[00:56:00]  I guess this would be a way to keep the hurricanes from coming over.  You ignite the sea with burning oil.  Great.  And the heat.  And you kill all sea life.  That's wonderful.  That's it.  We take an aircraft and throw baby seals into the center of the eye of the hurricane.  The whirling mass of baby seal hides it blood and guts.  We'll slow the hurricane down.  Of course, in the event we don't have seals, we can use the Negro. 
[00:56:30]  It is 1950.  Our ancestors weren't too smart.  Flooding is a problem.  Yeah.  Instead of building dams with valuable resources, we will plug up the places where the floods come in with bald eagles.  Pile up stacks of bald eagles to keep the flooding out of your city. 
[00:57:00]  And again, in the event we can't find bald eagles, the Negro will suffice.  What about space travel there, Mr. Future Man?  Again, turn to the Negro.  Every last one of them and put them on a spaceship to another planet.  That is our space program here in 1950 when we are very intolerant.  Not like today.  Where we're very, very, very tolerant. 
[00:57:30]  There's no reason to be tolerant.  We're all just humans.  This February.  I better shut my mouth.  Space travel.  Yeah.  Nobody has yet circumnavigated the moon in a rocket spaceship.  But the idea is not left down.  In 2000, we will still not be laughing at the idea of going to the moon.  The hell?  By 2000 and 1950, we were supposed to be on Mars.  I saw the movies.  The big stupid spaceships with all that headroom. 
[00:58:00]  Well, here's our cars.  This is what our cars were supposed to look like in the year 2000.  Cars are teardrop in shape and driven from the rear by a high compression engine that burns cheap, dentured alcohol.  What?  Denatured?  Denatured alcohol.  Did I say dentured?  Yeah.  That's my denaturizer.  Denatured alcohol.  The car is used chiefly for shopping.  So your TV drives it? 
[00:58:30]  Is that what I'm to gather?  For shopping and for journeys of not more than 20 miles.  You will never drive more than 20 miles.  And do you know why?  You will use the family helicopter, which is kept on the roof.  Hoo-hoo, Robin.  I'm going out to the Hamptons in my Howie-copter.  I just signed a deal, which gives me $20,000 a year.  My God, it's 1950.  I'm rich.  Hoo-hoo.  I invented the helicopter, Robin. 
[00:59:00]  All right.  In the year 2000, we were supposed to live to 85 years old.  Women and men of age 70 in A.D.  2000 look as if they're 40.  Wrinkled, sagging cheeks, leathery skin are curiosities or signs of neglect.  70 is the new 40.  Lifespan has been lengthened to 85.  I guess that's pretty accurate, right?  Well, late 70s, I guess.  Serious virus diseases as influenza, the common cold, polymyloiditis, and dozens of others are cured with ease. 
[00:59:30]  With ease.  Cancer.  Cancer not yet curable in 2000.  Sorry, folks.  Well, we really can't even lie about this one.  No.  Everything they've just made up, the suns that are hanging over cities that illuminate them on 200-foot-high towers,  but they can't say that cancer is going to be curable. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  And then multiple sclerosis or palsy are no longer regarded as incurable.  Electrochemical methods of stimulating and reactivating nerves so the victims of Parkinson's disease are no longer an object of pity.  He just said they're pitying them.  Oh, man.  One thing, they got close.  One or two, yeah.  Hey, do the bad predictions, Ant, as Mr. Future Man.  This is really good.  This will wrap up this segment here. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, these are actual predictions that were made?  Yeah, from people.  This one comes from Thomas Watson, chairman of IBM, from 1943.  I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.  A world market.  This coming from Popular Mechanics 1949, where a calculator on the ENIAC is equipped with 18,000 vacuum tubes and weighs 30 tons.  Computers in the future will have only 1,000 vacuum tubes and weigh only 1.5 tons. 
[01:01:00]  I cannot wait for this future.  That's some laptop.  The telephone has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication.  The device is inherently of no value to us.  That's a Western Union memo from 1876.  And Sir William Preece, chief engineer of the British Post Office in 1876. 
[01:01:30]  The Americans have need of the telephone, but we do not.  We have plenty of messenger boys.  Yes.  Messenger boys.  That's really looking at the future.  This guy is David Sarnoff's associates in response to his urgings for investment in the radio in the 1920s.  The wireless music box has no imaginable commercial value. 
[01:02:00]  Who would pay for a message sent to nobody in particular?  Wow.  You got that one wrong.  Yeah, you sure did.  H.M. Warner from Warner Brothers in 1927.  Who in the hell wants to hear actors talk?  That's a great quote.  Here it is again.  William Thomas, Lord Kelvin.  British scientist.  British scientist, 1899.  Radio has no future. 
[01:02:30]  Heavier than air flying machines are impossible.  X-rays will prove to be a hoax.  And he was a scientist.  Oh, that is great.  This wasn't some guy at the local pub.  It was the scientist of the day.  Heavier than air flying machines are impossible.  So you have to figure out something lighter than air.  Only dirigibles can fly.  That is fantastic.  How about this one from Edwin L. Drake?  Tried to enlist to his project to drill for oil in 1859. 
[01:03:00]  Drill for oil?  You mean drill into the ground to try to find oil?  You're crazy.  Where is it supposed to come from?  Oh, my God.  This is a surprise.  Albert Einstein, 1932.  I was going to leave the name as a surprise.  I'm sorry.  One of those little teases as to who would have said this.  I'm sorry.  Albert Einstein in 1932.  Yeah.  There is not the slightest indication that nuclear energy will ever be obtainable. 
[01:03:30]  It would mean that the atom would have to be shattered at will.  Who said that?  I'm going to let you guess.  Albert Einstein.  Can you believe it?  Airplanes are interesting toys, but of no military value.  That's the...  Who is this?  I'm not even going to try.  Some dummy.  Some professor of strategy.  Some dummy. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  And a Boeing engineer after the flight of the 247, a twin-engine plane that holds 10 people.  He said, there will never be a bigger plane built.  And this is from Pierre Pochette.  Go to the one above that.  That's kind of interesting.  Oh.  Office of Patents.  The U.S. Office of Patents in 1899.  1899.  Everything that can be invented has been invented.  Some people say that is an urban legend. 
[01:04:30]  We should add that.  Yeah.  I'm sure in 1899, they probably thought everything they have was probably it.  That's all you need, right?  Yeah.  This guy...  Don't you kind of think that today in the year 2007?  It's like, what else can we possibly invent?  What can we invent?  We can elaborate on things we already have.  That's what I mean, make the planes faster and more convenient and the computer is smaller  and maybe move everything to the computer.  Stuff like that, sure.  But what else could we possibly invent?  But if you had the answer, you would have invented it and you'd be ready. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  But these idiots had no foresight.  Like, right now, you can't, like, say, transport people.  Yeah.  But we'll know that you will eventually be able to transport people from here to L.A. instantly.  But back then, it was as ridiculous as right now, let's say, okay, I foresee us traveling  the speed of light and in a day getting to some of the outer reaches of the solar system  when we can just...  That's ridiculously impossible.  It ain't going to happen.  That's a bigger stretch than we have a 10-seat plane. 
[01:05:30]  We'll never build an 11-seat plane.  I know, right?  I thought you meant like the covered wagon phase where they were going cross-country  and then imagining an aircraft taking them the same journey in four hours or something.  But, yeah, okay, the 10-seat, 11-seat argument.  Wouldn't you just make the seat slightly smaller to get the 11th seat in there?  A bigger plane will never be...  A bigger plane has just been built.  This is Pierre Pache, professor of physiology in 1872. 
[01:06:00]  Louis Pasteur's theory of germs is ridiculous fiction.  Didn't believe in germs?  Yeah, well...  Died of an infection.  All right.  Sure.  It goes on and on, but there's a few of the doozies.  Yeah, those are great.  Boy, they sure did not know what the hell was going to happen.  And then a lot of the stuff we thought would happen just never did.  Everyone really concentrated on computers.  Thank God. 
[01:06:30]  All right.  Just a little taste.  I got a little taste for you, Anthony.  Oh?  If you weren't listening yesterday, shame, shame, shame on you.  Oh, no.  Is this me?  Anthony was very, very, very hungover yesterday.  Under the way.  Actually, this part of the show, you weren't hungover.  You were still drunk.  Let's just be honest with each other.  This part of the show, you were still drunk.  I wound up going to sleep at about 2 o'clock in the morning.  And I get up at 4.  So I had a poker game over the house. 
[01:07:00]  I was drinking some beers.  Not drinking any booze.  Just a steady, you know, had a beer in my hand for the whole poker game kind of a thing.  Like you'd normally do on a weekend, maybe.  Not on a school night.  And then it was 2 in the morning.  Got to sleep.  4 in the morning.  Wake up.  Now I'm feeling hungover and still a little tipsy.  But more hungover than tipsy.  So I get in.  Feeling like crap.  But able to pull off this portion of the show. 
[01:07:30]  And then once we got over to XM, it was full-blown hangover.  Where I was just ready to get sick.  Couldn't do anything.  Couldn't move.  My head was pounding.  Felt like crap.  And at that point, it was our jobs to make you puke.  To put me over the top, yeah.  I can't breathe out of my nose.  If I smell that sandwich, one more time.  I'm going to...  Oh, it's delicious.  I shouldn't have got so much cheese on it, though.  Fucking...  Oh, my God.  Okay.  All right.  Who's responsible for that? 
[01:08:00]  Oh, my God.  Who's responsible for it?  Ow!  You got that, right, Ow!  Who did it?  Oh, boy.  That was me, and I caught it.  Oh, what, what, what?  What happened?  I burned it, caught it, edited it, and then re-burned it.  So I must have somehow...  You know what?  Wrong track.  All right.  We're going to have to wait till it.  So does that mean every curse is still in that one?  No, just the first one.  I don't believe you.  I don't either.  Oops.  Sorry, Danny.  Danny.  All right.  Well, we'll have to get into that after the break.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:08:30]  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!  Ryan Regan on his way.  Ron Jeremy on his way.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Or an egg.  This E-Rock thing has taken off.  It's got a life of its own.  What?  We're talking about the waxing that E-Rock did pretty much as a goof on Monday.  Lost a bet.  You know, that old gag. 
[01:09:00]  It's been done a million times.  Yep.  And E-Rock got waxed.  It was supposed to just be a Brazilian wax.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But that didn't work out too well because he's kind of hairless in certain areas.  So we decided.  Somebody came up with a brilliant idea of waxing his chest and then his armpits, which turned  out to just be the most painful thing.  He's screaming like he's being hacked apart with a machete. 
[01:09:30]  The video is unbelievable.  It's on opiananthony.com.  It's on YouTube.  We're trying to get this video to go viral.  So we need the help of the O&A pass because we think it's got something.  We had a five-minute version.  We knocked it down to a minute 20.  That version's up on YouTube.  It's getting viewed nicely.  It's really, really funny because then the end of it is kind of a montage where E-Rock  kind of falls off the toilet into a wall over and over again. 
[01:10:00]  It's worth a chuckle.  Just in case you missed it from Monday, here's some of the audio.  It's like 50 seconds here.  Listen to this.  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh, he had a curse.  Did I hear a curse?  He cursed again.  Did he think something inappropriate? 
[01:10:30]  Wait, what?  Oh, God.  E-Rock, you cursed.  E-Rock, you cursed.  He fell off the toilet.  You closed your other arm. 
[01:11:00]  So if you're new to this show, you've got to understand we like things to take on a life  of its own.  And we're taking this to the next level now, okay?  So the video's up on YouTube.  Check it out, please.  It's really, really funny.  It's also on opanthony.com.  The audio's also up on opanthony.com, just the raw audio.  And that's where we take it to the next level.  People are now taking that audio.  As they usually do with audio from this program that makes it up on the website.  They take it, and they add to it, and send it back to us, and see if it floats. 
[01:11:30]  So I would love to give this guy credit.  I don't have a name in front of me, unfortunately.  Is it on the disc?  This guy needs to get credit.  I'm sure he'll come forward.  Nope.  It just said, well, I won't even tell.  Should we tell the people what it is, or just play it?  No, just play it.  Obviously, they took the clips of him screaming, but they threw it into a movie.  If you will not be done, you will be destroyed.  Now, young Skywalker, you will die. 
[01:12:00]  That's a good job. 
[01:12:30]  A little Star Wars clip.  That's a good job.  Featuring E-Rock as young Skywalker.  Got to thank Terry from Mississippi for sending that in.  Terry from Mississippi, great job.  Little fat Luke falling off a toilet, getting trapped in between there and the wall.  I don't think we're going to get a better one than that.  No.  This guy raised the bar really high.  Now, young mayonnaise eater. 
[01:13:00]  Now, young no-walker.  Poor E-Rock.  You know I tease because I love, right?  We love you.  I see his little cap nodding up and down behind the monitors.  I never get to look at him.  I just get to throw papers at his head every so often.  And dodge balls.  It's just enraging the way his hat and head pokes over those monitors.  I know.  You just want to throw a stick of dynamite over him.  Oh.  A good sword. 
[01:13:30]  Just sever that so I don't have to look at it.  Yeah.  And chop his head off.  Okay.  By the way, it's a really slow news day.  The headline in our paper is, I was gay in the NBA.  Ex-player comes out of closet.  New book.  Yeah.  It would have been good because I know nothing about basketball.  I admitted it.  We could talk a little baseball, a little football.  Very little.  I'm not a big sports guy.  Basketball, nothing.  Hate the game.  Nothing.  So I had to ask this morning.  I go, is this guy known?  Does anyone know this guy? 
[01:14:00]  I love my hoops.  So it says, see page three.  And I'm thinking like a shocking picture.  Like it's a.  Come on.  Michael Jordan.  Yeah.  Somebody like that.  That's what I would know.  Akeem.  Patrick Ewan.  I'm like, oh my God.  Who it is?  Who is it?  I mean.  Who's the gay guy?  It's John Amachi.  What?  Exactly.  John Amachi was gay?  John Amachi or Amachi.  Here's how you knew it was a nobody because they didn't say his name.  I knew it was a nobody because they had to tease it to get you to look in. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  They wouldn't have teased it.  Right.  They said Patrick Ewan gay.  It would have been a big name on the front.  Everyone's buying the paper.  You're right, Jimmy.  It should have been Muggsy Bogue, though, because of his height.  How perfect to be a homosexual and only 5'8 or whatever he was in the NBA.  5'8.  He wished.  I think he wished he was 5'8.  He'd be like heaven just a few inches above your face.  Was that the short guy who could dunk?  Yes.  Well, there were a few in the league that were.  See, I'm trying to show that I know something.  I don't think Muggsy was 5'8.  Maybe not.  I think he was like 5'4.  Yeah. 
[01:15:00]  He was way down.  Spud Webb was the big.  Yeah.  The famous.  Oh, okay.  Whatever.  But it turns out this guy, I was gay in the NBA.  He played 5 years.  Oh, they're saying he played from 95 to 2003.  Yeah, 8 years.  For four teams.  He was one of those journeymen.  Yeah.  This is a non-story.  One of those teams where the pink team.  Is this really shocking?  There's probably some really big names that are playing in the NBA.  Of course there are.  Or played in the NBA that were gay. 
[01:15:30]  Or baseball, football.  All of them, I'm sure.  All of them.  Gay guys.  But we get this guy who no one heard of.  Nobody.  I mean, he played for the Cavaliers, the Magic, the Jazz.  Oh, those guys are fags.  Was traded to the Knicks, and the Knicks never suited him up.  Of course not.  Charles Oakley probably raped him.  That's what we get today as far as news.  There's really not much else.  Except maybe for this.  Except maybe this cute little story that we're going to throw at you. 
[01:16:00]  The boy fights for the pink team.  The boy fights for the pink team.  Dan's a big basketball fan.  And did you know this guy?  The gay guy?  Yeah.  No, besides me.  Been over the house?  In your personal life.  Did you know him?  Yeah.  I walked into one of the office, too, when I said he was on my fantasy team.  Yeah, yeah.  He had to say that.  He was on my fantasy team.  Oh.  Could you spell out the fantasy in graphic detail, please?  Yeah.  No.  It was a very lean year for centers that year, and he was on my team.  Mm-hmm.  And completely unmemorable. 
[01:16:30]  Fantasy football just taking over the world.  So all the other sports are trying to get into the action.  It's just, I don't know.  Is it as good as fantasy football?  No.  No.  Of course not.  The whole concept was really dumb to me.  Sorry.  Fantasy football people out there.  I just.  Oh, they live for their fantasy football out there.  I don't know how it works.  They live.  I don't even know how fantasy football, like, works.  I know you own a few players.  You have a draft.  So you get together, and you have a nice draft.  Yeah, but then how does it work once you own the players? 
[01:17:00]  Then you get a whole bunch of different players from different games, which makes watching  football every Sunday really exciting, because you have interest in every single game.  But what happens?  So now your player does something.  And you get points for that.  And you get point values for what he does?  Yeah.  Each position has stats attributed to it.  Uh-huh.  You know, defenders will get points for tackles, and, you know, QBs will get points for passes  and whatnot.  Right.  And so your team, made up of different players on different teams, gets points.  And you either, I mean, there's different ways to do it. 
[01:17:30]  You play somebody else each week with your fantasy team.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you have sort of a win-loss record.  Oh, I got you.  So you're playing somebody else, and if you get more points because your players did better,  then you win.  I think I'm message boards, and they beat each other up all week, leading to Sunday.  It's, you know, it's huge.  Talk smack.  Yeah.  I'm a big football fan.  What happens if, like, you have conflicting, like, what if one of your players makes a touchdown,  and the other one throws the ball, and it goes out of bounds? 
[01:18:00]  The touchdown would probably be worth more points.  So now the draft, that seems pretty damn important.  Yes.  I mean, you obviously want the good players.  Yes.  What determines the draft?  The coin toss?  It's like a lottery system, almost kind of like the normal draft.  Yeah?  Yeah.  But, you know, fantasy football, they got it all figured out, but then they're trying  to do it with baseball and basketball.  It just doesn't really wash.  Not really.  Well, baseball, you got 162 games. 
[01:18:30]  I mean, you could probably...  Well, they got some cool, like, home run, like, fantasy baseball things going on where  you pick home run hitters and then see who gets the most homers for the year.  Aren't there guys, though, in football that, like, do nothing?  I mean, they're on the field.  They're playing the game.  But, like, every player playing has something he can do that can be attributed to some kind  of point value?  No, not really.  I'm getting from the booth, no.  No, no, no, no.  Yeah?  Like, the bigger defensive...  It's actually, you pick a defense usually, right?  You pick one defense and, like... 
[01:19:00]  One defense.  Oh, oh.  So you pick the Rams defense.  Oh, you pick the entire defense of a team.  Okay, now that makes more sense.  I was like, what the hell is he doing?  I don't think he...  You have one guy and he just kind of, yeah, just kind of runs around.  The center.  How many times he snapped it?  Did you gamble for money?  Or is it just the winner eats the cracker?  What happened?  The cracker and the...  Henry from Manhattan.  It was fantasy baseball that started it all, you freaking goof.  Oh, he showed you.  And then he writes, uh, free FM blows. 
[01:19:30]  Right?  Thanks, Henry.  Yeah, we played for money, just like a pool, whatever.  It might have started with baseball, but the football is the one that really just completely  took off.  Fantasy radio.  Fantasy radio.  Fantasy radio, yeah?  Fantasy radio.  All right.  I'm taking whoopee.  I'll be swapped out for a Chuck Knife for an Artie Latin.  Neighbors say Angela Nelaney and her husband Paul had a turbulent relationship.  A few expected her to land behind bars. 
[01:20:00]  She's accused of allegedly planting wasps in his truck, wasps he's allergic to.  Tonight, we knocked on his door.  He saw us, but did not want to talk.  Investigators say she or someone else put the potentially deadly creatures in a soda  can, left it in his truck.  He got inside and turned on the heater.  The wasps flew everywhere.  Her husband wasn't the only one inside the truck.  With him, their 18-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son.  Nice.  All of them made a run for it.  Investigators say this isn't the first time the woman tried to kill her husband. 
[01:20:30]  Wow.  With a wasp.  Bunch of lawyers.  White Anglo-Saxon Protestants.  In a soda can?  My God.  My God.  How did he not notice that giant soda can?  The future.  The future.  Wasps will be in soda cans.  What the hell is that?  Wow.  What a bitch.  With the kids in the car?  Granted, what a bitch, but what did this guy do?  My young son in the car.  You got to look at it from both angles here.  I wonder what the guy did that she went to this extreme.  Adultry. 
[01:21:00]  Or she just nuts.  Yeah, but what kind?  What do you mean?  Maybe her sister.  Her face in the pillow.  What do you mean?  No, her sister, her mother, her stepdaughter.  It sounds like this is...  A woman scorned, it sounds like.  We talk about this all the time.  We love these stories because we all know it starts with that wedding song.  That just nice wedding song.  And then it just ends with something horrific.  The time of my life.  And you're dancing with your girl at the wedding. 
[01:21:30]  Fast forward, you're putting wasps in his car.  You're putting wasps that will kill him in the car.  That's it.  How many years went by?  Did they say how long they were married?  Well, there were some kids that were up there, so they were married for a while.  Where did it go from the end of the night?  It's up to you.  New York!  New York!  With all the bridal party doing the kick line.  Right.  And all right, have a good honeymoon.  Yay! 
[01:22:00]  All right, how could I kill my husband?  And then time, 1990, 1991, 1992, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98.  And it leads to wasps.  Collecting deadly wasps in a soda can.  I have to kill this bastard.  Oh, get this bastard.  What happened to daddy's little girl and dancing with your father?  All stars, you got that one?  That's why weddings are just crap.  Ah, there it is.  Oh, look, and here's the people sitting at the table.  Oh, look, they're dancing.  Oh, look at the happy couple.  I wonder what they're whispering in each other's ears. 
[01:22:30]  Look, they're giggling to each other.  Oh, it's so...  They're in love.  You could see it in their face.  They are in love.  Fast forward 12 years.  Come on, everybody.  Kill this son of a bitch.  Kill him.  How do you get wasps into a soda can?  I was just thinking, like, I pictured tweezers.  Yeah.  What is she doing?  How do you calm wasps down enough to shove them into a soda can?  Get into a soda can. 
[01:23:00]  Someone is going with your fantasy radio thing.  Yeah.  Tony from my Subaru.  I had Stern and Greaseman on my team.  Bad year.  Waddle Doodle.  Waddle Doodle.  Fantasy radio.  My point value, zero.  What about next year?  Zero.  Look at the draft.  Here it is.  Somebody just chose the Greaseman. 
[01:23:30]  Hey, why are you rolling that piece of paper up and throwing it away?  Take the Grease.  Take the Grease.  I'll say something outrageous that'll get me fired.  Waddle Doodle.  Bone dry.  My point value is bone dry.  Steven from Bayshore.  Of course, he's always good for one.  One minute you're dancing to Always and Forever.  Next thing you know, there's a hornet's nest in your cornflakes.  Hornet's nest.  We love this scenario.  One of our favorite ones on this radio show. 
[01:24:00]  Because it all starts at that wedding song.  And we do the bit every once in a while to the people that are in hell out there.  Yeah.  You know, what horrific thing is going on in your life now?  And what was your wedding song?  What was your wedding song?  That started it off.  It's a great bit.  I love the idea of just taking that moment, the wedding, and then the attempted murder,  and just eliminate the middle.  Just take all that crap out of the middle and look at each of those side by side.  Yeah.  What a contrast.  Oh, it's great, isn't it? 
[01:24:30]  Our love will last forever.  Your husband and kids are running out of the car because deadly wasps are chasing them  because you hate this man now.  You hate him.  Oh.  We could take a few calls after the break.  If you want to play, it's really easy.  You've got to tell us what your wedding song was.  And we play a little of the wedding song.  And then you tell your horrific tale.  My love, I never... 
[01:25:00]  Where's the wedding song?  You need a wedding song?  Yeah.  All right.  Give us a wedding song there, E-Rock.  Every day, love me your own special way.  Everyone has their camcorders out.  Why not?  They're looking into each other's eyes with nothing but love.  Nothing but love.  Thinking of the possibilities. 
[01:25:30]  Thinking of their future together.  Aw.  What are they going to name their first kid?  Oh, this is so wonderful.  They can't wait to get on their honeymoon to do some of that effing.  Will you have the chicken or the steak tonight?  I'll have the chicken, please.  Thank you.  Look at them.  They are just so...  Ah, fast forward.  You're a filthy whore. 
[01:26:00]  I know tomorrow will still be the same.  A negro.  Oh.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  A couple of great beautiful girls, huh?  Show me with your mouth.  Show me with your mouth.  Every day.  Show me your own special way. 
[01:26:30]  Aw.  You'll do what we tell you to do, you dirty, low-down sluts.  I was only joking.  Wasting your time with a black.  Huh.  What the heck are you guys doing?  Trying to ruin my life and make me... 
[01:27:00]  Hello, exactly.  You have something to say.  I have something to say.  All right, so let's just talk.  What the heck are you guys doing?  Would you?  Would you?  Would you?  Would you?  It gets the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.  Just horrors.  Well, we got the phones just lit, so we should take a break, get into some of these horrific stories.  It always starts with the wedding song. 
[01:27:30]  Certainly does.  It's a lovely wedding song.  Well, more fantasy radio coming in.  Oh?  For your fantasy radio teams.  We're trying to help people out today.  Is it draft day?  Jay from Syracuse.  I'm looking to trade Mancow.  Any takers?  No one wants the trade.  All right.  Very good. 
[01:28:00]  Ron is here.  Oh.  Ron Jeremy is here.  And Brian Regan is here.  In the same room.  Yeah.  They're both...  Don't let them touch.  They're just...  The universe will end.  They're just both looking at the ceiling, whistling.  So, what do you do for a living?  Oh, that's great.  That's good.  No, whatever, you know.  That's nice.  I tell jokes.  All of a sudden, he just picks up his phone awkwardly, see if he has a text message. 
[01:28:30]  Someone's calling me.  Someone's making a phone call.  I better answer this promptly.  So, what do you do for a living?  Is that what you said you did for a living?  No, that's...  You know...  I guess every, you know...  Every job is good as long as you're working.  Oh, my God.  Will people please listen closer?  Opie, you're a tool.  Fantasy baseball started it all in 1980.  I said that.  Yeah.  But it didn't take off like fantasy football has. 
[01:29:00]  Right.  That's the point I'm making today.  Silly.  Henry already corrected me, butt nugget from Jersey.  He's been corrected.  The point I'm making is you didn't hear about fantasy baseball as much as you hear about fantasy football.  End of discussion.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.

This week on the Razzle Dazzle Variety Show, it's the Musical Adventure Hour,  where you'll hear one O and A staff member pick the songs while the rest of the staff picks them apart.  On this week's Musical Adventure Hour...  Is it Daniel?  Oh, is this a promo?  I don't know what the fuck it is.  It sounds like it's a promo.  No.  Oh, he's a fucking idiot.  Oh, he's such a fucking idiot. 
[01:30:00]  Oh.  Why do I bother?  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM 202.  Opie and Anthony!  Opie and Anthony!  Now this is going to be interesting.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:30:30]  In studio, two friends of the show.  Living very different lives.  To say the least.  We got Brian Regan over here.  The Brian Regan.  Hey, hey, hey.  The porn star.  And we got Ron Jeremy, the very, very funny comedian over there.  Well, well, well, what happened?  Well, no, you got the bios, the bios.  Oh, what?  What happened?  No, you got them in the wrong order over there.  Ah.  Really?  I pulled on my pants and people laugh hysterically. 
[01:31:00]  They cry.  Please.  Yeah, they cry.  What are you going to do with that?  What?  Get away from me.  Have you guys ever met before?  No, man.  We're lovers.  Made a film, Romeo and Julio.  No, I'm kidding.  Have you met before?  We have not, but it's a pleasure to meet you, man.  Nice to meet you.  Same here.  You ever seen Ron's work?  Any of Ron's work?  Yeah, we've got the video library at home and, you know, sit down with my wife and kids.  Hey, I'm honored.  The wife and kids is like a Disney movie.  I'm honored to be in the comedy film, The Aristocrats. 
[01:31:30]  You know, when I'm in the, you know.  Yeah.  I'm in a DVD.  I did a poem.  Penn Jillette, a freshman, did a poem for it.  And I actually lasted in the actual movie up until Sundance.  Then he had to cut me out and put me in the DVD because he said we couldn't cut the poem  down.  We had to keep it as is, so I was on the DVD, not on the movie.  So you were in the extras?  Yes.  On the DVD?  Yes.  It's called It Was On A Lovely Day by Ron Jeremy.  And I'm sure it could not be spoken on your standard radio.  Oh, I have to be stopping every two seconds. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  Actually, a lot of it could be said.  I bet not.  Ron?  You've got a book, though.  You wrote a book.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right now, it's doing really well.  It's at Barnes & Nobles.  It's at the Virgin Megastores.  We had a big, big signing over at the Virgin Megastore over in Union Square.  Yeah.  A lot of people showed up.  It was great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They want to see you.  It's the story of my entire life.  The legend.  Yeah.  Well, the interesting thing is, I mean, I've been watching you since, like, the early  80s, you know, with, like, Dorothy LeMay.  I'm, like, an old-school porn freak. 
[01:32:30]  Like, what point did you realize, like, you were going to go...  I like how you looked over...  I'm sorry.  I like how you looked over at Brian, like...  Jimmy just made an expression, like, he goes, I'm an old-school porn freak.  And he looks at Brian and nods his head with his eyes open real wide, like, right, Brian?  Right.  Me and you.  You know what I'm talking about.  Old-school porn...  Old-school porno freaks.  If anyone in the room knows what I'm talking about, it's Brian Regan.  It's Brian Regan.  You saw Taboo 2, huh?  Yeah.  Taboo 2.  You made me want to write a book?  No, no, no.  At what point did you realize, like, when you're working with John Holmes and all those guys, 
[01:33:00]  that you're going to become probably the biggest name that business has ever seen?  I mean, it's like, what point do you go from just being a guy who's getting laid on film  to all of a sudden, like, wow, I'm the biggest porn star in the history of the business?  The cult thing.  When, you know, Jay Leno and different people make jokes about you on TV, rock stars put  you in their albums and in their songs, like Sublime did, Tommy Lee did.  Yeah, but how did that happen is what you were getting at.  It could have been anybody.  It's from, uh...  Just, again, from doing mainstream work, not just doing porn.  You know, from doing, like, 12 music videos.  You know, I did a rap song that was on Billboard 27 Weeks. 
[01:33:30]  You guys know about that.  You know, and things like this that make you more known in the mainstream media than just  doing porn.  Doing the John Bobbitt movie, for example, was huge, Worldwide News.  And then the Divine Brown film, we called it a Doc-Hugh drama because of Hugh Grant.  So things like that gets you out there in the public.  And being an average-looking guy, getting lucky, you know, created some attention as well.  You see the gorgeous, you know, when you're a kid, you see the football player, the lead  captain of the football team gets the cheerleader.  Then you see me with these gorgeous girls, it's like, hey, hope for all of us. 
[01:34:00]  So you were like the name that everybody kind of used as the generic porn star name.  If you needed to have the generic porn star name, if you weren't into porn, you would  just say, oh, that Ron Jeremy.  Well, John Holmes was first, right?  John Holmes was that name, yeah.  If you needed that John Holmes.  He died on my birthday.  That's bizarre, huh?  Really?  Yeah.  He died in March 12, yeah.  What, 83?  88?  I don't know the exact dates.  I don't know.  No, but it was, uh...  Yeah, so the thing, that's, uh...  Yeah, so things like that.  Otherwise, I would just be another Peter North or Tom Byron or Randy West.  It's doing the mainstream stuff and some cult films, like, you know, the film Boondock 
[01:34:30]  Saints.  Mm-hmm.  You know, it was so huge in colleges that 20th Century Fox picked it up five years after  it was released.  You know, I'm in that film.  Yeah.  I mean, a lot of people don't know it because I look a little different, but that's a huge  film in Orgasmo, the South Park film.  Yeah.  These are cult films in colleges.  Right.  So that's my biggest audience.  Okay.  You know?  And that's what does it, not just the porn, you know?  Jimmy, tell us a little story about, uh, about you.  Oh, I love that story.  Yeah, he's, I've told it in front of him, um, yeah, but we've never gotten, uh, both  of you guys in the same room at the same time, so. 
[01:35:00]  You know, there's some of the quotes in my book.  Drew Carey, Sarah Silverman.  There's so many comedians that have done Ron Jeremy jokes, and I love them.  I mean, Drew's is funny, a bit insulting.  Drew Carey says, uh, you know, Brad Pitt, I heard, is in doubt.  That's just not fair.  You should either be good-looking or have a big one, not both.  Look at Ron Jeremy.  That's fair.  And Sarah Silverman used to say, she has on her comedy album, because why does Ron Jeremy,  you know, do things with his pinky in the air?  Yeah.  He's a classy guy.  And I've only, a lot of, you've made a great routine. 
[01:35:30]  Eddie Murphy did a routine about me doing that, and George Lopez, me kissing myself, you know,  that kind of thing.  And Comic Relief, do you guys see the latest Comic Relief?  I heard you on the subject of, uh, quite a bit of, uh.  Five times they made jokes about me right there in the audience.  Robin Williams did it twice.  Yeah.  So that stuff is what makes you, and the more that happens, the more that happens, and  it's like, the more famous you get, the more famous you get.  And you become part of the mainstream.  Right.  It's a vicious cycle that feeds itself.  But also, you're very eloquent.  I mean, you, you, you, when you do get interviewed, you, you know how to speak, which probably  a lot of the porn stars are negative. 
[01:36:00]  Obviously, I have six years of college and a master's degree and two BAs, so people are  surprised to hear that.  I could have been a doctorate until he was in graduate school.  Damn.  And you just decided, screw it.  Yeah.  Literally.  Quite literally.  Listen, I've got to do something else, because if I just stay as a teacher, Jim Norton is  not going to do one of Jeremy jokes.  And so I had to be funny.  Were you impressed with Jim?  Oh, he's just funny.  We had a great, a great time.  He held in there.  He held in strong.  Well, we've got to explain this, because there's a lot of people on there that have no  idea what we're talking about.  The pros.  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy got to play with the pros one night. 
[01:36:30]  I love that.  It's a true story.  In 2004, after I co-hosted the AVN with Jenna Jameson.  Brian Earmuffs.  Earmuffs.  Earmuffs over there.  Oh, Brian's done the same thing.  Stop.  Anyone who knows who's gone, any wives or girlfriends, please cover your ears.  Continue.  And Dennis Hoff, who owns the Bunny Ranch, is a mutual friend of ours, so I walk up to  Dennis' room, and Ron is with a girl.  You have to be careful how to say this.  And Ron invites me.  Not just with a girl.  He's with a girl.  You know, Ron, it's on.  He's doing what he should be doing with a girl. 
[01:37:00]  Right.  It's on.  And you just walk in, and it's no problem, because it's...  Because they're holding hands.  Yeah.  It's what you do with a girl.  Oh.  No, you know what it was?  She was choking, and he was heimlicking her.  He was helping her.  Very radio savvy.  Yeah.  And he looks at me, and he goes, hey, man, and we're talking, and he goes, I think she  needs, and he implies that I should jump on the other end and make the letter H.  Nicely done.  And, yeah, he complimented me.  Wow.  Yeah. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He complimented me.  That's a nice compliment from Ron Jeremy.  Certainly is.  He held in there.  He was doing good.  And then I just, I did it to goof around with him.  You know, I did a couple of, you know, bolts, jolts, whatever you want to say.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He did, you know, just a mess.  Oh, yeah, because you do a bit about that, and it is so funny.  I'm here.  He's doing the President Clinton definition of sex.  Right.  Not really sex.  Not really.  I'm doing the real sex.  Yep.  And I'm doing an extra, you know, giving a few bolts once in a while to make it, to 
[01:38:00]  make, to watch Jim Norton jump.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just to scare Jim a little bit.  How do I affect her?  Who affects him?  Right.  It's like a little, a shock wave that is sent through.  And how did Jim, how did you explain it?  The punchline.  There's no way to do it on, let me think, I can't do it on regular radio.  Yeah.  I can do it on XM.  A man can affect another man's sex life is how you said it, right?  No.  But the implication that you're an impressive boy. 
[01:38:30]  There's no way to get it on regular radio.  I tell the story as it happened, completely true.  It's the greatest sexual thing ever because it was just to pull up, to be involved in  that, let's just say a shish kebab with Ron Jeremy.  I mean, come on.  Yeah.  No more famous guy to deal with.  Yeah.  To just sit there eye to eye.  It's like skateboarding with Tony Hawk, that kind of thing.  It's like fantasy baseball camp or something.  Fantasy porno league.  All right.  A-Rod pitched to me.  I should have said a pitcher for the joke. 
[01:39:00]  Ah, well, yeah.  When it came time for the happy ending, one of us had to duck.  Can we see that on radio?  I bailed out.  I was such a coward in my suit, holding my hands on my hips, trying to be brave while  Dennis snapped pictures.  There's photos of it, too.  Is there really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that'd be interesting.  Wow.  Which website can we see this?  Eatabullet.com.  And the book, it goes through what?  What periods of your life?  Don't you love that title?  Everything?  Hardest Man in Showbiz. 
[01:39:30]  It goes from the very beginning.  You know, for me as a child, it mentions things that, a lot of things besides porn.  You know, my parents both being, you know, veterans of wars.  My mother was a spy during World War II.  Really?  Her picture's in there and her trench coat.  She was in the OSS.  She was a cryptographer, you know, a decoder.  She spoke many languages after graduating college at age 19.  So she worked for the war, became a lieutenant.  You know, my dad said that's why he married her, to screw an officer.  That was his name.  You know, but he was a sergeant in the war.  And then I had a cousin who died as a hero, got the Purple Heart and stuff in the Battle 
[01:40:00]  of the Bulge.  A lot of that stuff's in there.  An uncle who was a gangster, who was a partner for Bugsy Siegel.  Also related to the Greengrass family, which people know here in New York, Barney Greengrass,  Sturgeon King, you know, his relative.  So a lot of stuff like that's in there.  And then, of course, you know, a lot of interesting stories about celebrities.  You know, some of the biggest names in Hollywood and some fun, salacious, scandalous, sexy stories.  And the thing is, I really emphasize saying that they were single at the time.  So nobody could say I outed them or ratted them out. 
[01:40:30]  You know, I didn't say anybody cheated.  I give fun stories, but I go out of my way to say that they were single at the time.  And I never lie about that.  Who's a famous actress that you, or famous Hollywood, like regular person that's not  important that you banged?  Well, I would never say who actually banged.  I would say who I've been involved in fun situations with.  All right.  You know, some of the guys, some of the male stars, or I would say like some of the women  I've gone out with.  Like I mentioned that, you know, I've gone out with, you know, Faruza Balk.  Now, I'm not saying anything sexual, but I took her to the premiere of Boogie Nights. 
[01:41:00]  I took her to Larry Flynn's Christmas party.  You know, Faruza Balk was Adam Sandow's girlfriend in Waterboy.  You know, she was the lead singer of the, a lead singer.  She was the lead of the craft, you know, John Sopranos.  You know, so I mentioned things over.  American history.  We've had conversations with Courtney Love at Larry Flynn's wedding.  So there's a lot of fun stories involving a lot of big names, you know, and some sexual,  some just fun.  Probably the best story in there is a story with Sam Kennison.  You guys are comedians.  I love Sam Kennison.  Yeah, of course.  Well, he died in a car accident.  Yeah.  And this is a true story.  And this is one of Bill Kennison's favorite stories. 
[01:41:30]  And Sam, this is years ago.  You know, Sam was late for a gig at the Catch Rising Star to meet up with Robin Williams,  right?  It's raining out.  We're discussing God because, you know, Sam being a Pentecostal minister, me being a  Jewish boy, he knew a lot about my religion as well.  And he's speeding and it's very wet out.  And I said, I wish I had more proof, you know, about the Lord above.  You know, I think he's there.  I kind of think he's there.  Well, he skids off the side of the highway, you know, 20 minutes later.  Car turns upside down.  You're in it with him?  Yes.  Shoots down an embankment at a vast speed. 
[01:42:00]  Somehow miraculously avoids all the trees.  Coasts to a stop in the middle of a farm upside down.  As we get out of the windows, the car sinks down.  I gather my phone book first.  We're picking glass off of our bodies.  And this is his girlfriend's mother's brand new car.  You know, Corey Ugler, I think her name was.  And so then the car sinks down.  We're now hitchhiking on a mud path.  We get to it.  We're picking glass off of our bodies.  Not one scratch, not one piece of blood, not one break, nothing.  And the car was totaled.  So Sam goes, hey, Jeremy, you believe in God now? 
[01:42:30]  He says, Sam, you've got a great length to prove a point.  And then it was Carl Above.  You know Carl Above?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Phil Kennison, who said 20 minutes later, Sam wasn't the one proving the point.  Goosebumps, huh?  You're like, oh, yeah.  Yeah, right.  So that's one of the stories in the book, you know?  Carl did a good joke on you two, I remember, years ago.  Yes.  Which one was that again?  That's something about a diving board.  It was like long and bouncy.  Diving board.  So Brian, how you been? 
[01:43:00]  I'm doing good, man.  Do you believe in God, Brian?  Well, I just slid in a car upside down, so yes, I do.  That's the test.  As nice as Brian is, he probably burns black churches.  And guess what?  We hitchhiked, got a ride, and we're 10 minutes late for the gig.  10 minutes late to the Catraiser Star.  Is that bizarre?  Yeah, after a car accident, it'd be 10 minutes late to a gig.  Impressive.  Yeah.  And Robin Williams would actually keep Sam in a lot of shows. 
[01:43:30]  You know, they were very good friends in the old days.  And Robin, you know, would tell some of the clubs that you've got to play Sam.  And a lot of clubs didn't want to.  And Robin said, I won't show up if you don't play him.  So Robin helped him.  In fact, all of a sudden, Robin owned a home in the hills of Hollywood that Sam Kennison rented.  This is about 18 years ago.  I shot a porn film at that home.  And Sam was there and watching and, you know, hanging out there, writing some of the dialogue.  And this is another wild story.  And, you know, one of the girls showed up next door by accident instead of where we were shooting in a sexy little lingerie outfit. 
[01:44:00]  And the house she walks into was the home of David Hasselhoff.  He was doing Knight Rider before he did Baywatch.  So she knocks on the door.  Before he got good.  Walks into the house.  He lets her in.  She goes, and she's wearing a sexy lingerie, big, giant double D's.  She goes, is this where the porno shoot's taking place?  And Hasselhoff says, well, it is now.  And I asked him, 18 years later, do you have this mansion if that really is a true story?  He said, yes, it is.  I said, that is great.  The Hoff.  The Hoff.  The Hoff.  I like the true story.  He told me this just about four months ago. 
[01:44:30]  Because originally I had it in the book as rumored to be.  But when he said to me that that's true, bingo, it's right in the book.  Now it's just, yeah, fact.  So I got a lot of stories.  Speaking of filming pornos in certain locations, I believe Radio Studio once.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  Right here.  Exactly.  That's what we're getting at.  This chair?  Not the one that he used to use.  No, we did a.  Howie's old chair.  Yeah, and we discussed that.  And again, I didn't write that story out because when the producer of that show would call up the different companies, 
[01:45:00]  he would say it was a shot in the studio.  So they knew this years ago.  And when he also was booking the girls to be in the movie, Taylor Wayne, Tabitha Stevens, Christy Lake,  he said this is a shock jock studio porn film.  So they already discussed that.  But whenever I was asked about it as a courtesy to the people involved,  let's say I can't confirm or deny the existence of a movie.  But then they decided to shelve it.  You know, maybe, you know, I guess Cabby felt bad that maybe Howard wasn't into it like he thought he was  or might affect his job at this stage. 
[01:45:30]  How did they get – how did you get – or did you have any kind of corporate permission or anything?  In all fairness to Cabby, he wasn't there when we were shooting the hardcore scenes in the studio,  but he was there to shoot the hardcore scenes outside the studio.  But just to open the – did he just say to you, hey, I'll let you in at night?  No.  And he could do that?  Or was it management actually allowed this?  No, I don't think they did or not.  Oh, good.  Bastards.  I'd hold that over their heads.  We were in the impression that the powers that be were totally okay with it and would even promote it.  In fact, when they made deals with Jill Kelly's company, there were two price tags attached to the porn film. 
[01:46:00]  It'll be this much if the shock jock, you know, acknowledges that it exists,  but we'll pay you this much ten times if he promotes it on radio.  Yeah.  And that's why this thing was already well known.  But when I was called by all the different personalities, I'd say I can't confirm or deny it,  while the film was being edited.  Alien Ant Farm was even in the film.  Some of the guys from the band, I think one of the road crew does a sex scene where the band is playing in the background.  And I didn't use their music.  The producer said you can use Alien Ant Farm's music. 
[01:46:30]  I said, no, you can't.  It's not their decision.  It's the record label.  They say, are you nuts?  Of course you can't use it.  So we didn't use the music.  And so, you know, so basically I was just telling the truth on telling what actually happened.  So where is the movie?  Well, it was edited and then it was shelved.  It was shelved.  It was sent to a guy named Brett.  And then there may be a VHS in existence.  Actually, there is one that the editor held on to.  It'll end up on YouTube.  Why didn't they release it?  No, no.  I have control over that.  It never will.  As a courtesy to the Pew Powers that be.  You know, we felt bad because here the performers flew 3,000 miles across the country because it was a shock jock porn film. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  We find out later on, after we hear him yelling at Elephant Boy for messing around in the green room, I'm going, I did a scene in the green room.  And then we realize he's not into it.  He was not totally happy about it.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Great.  I even wore a Gene Simmons mask during my sex scene.  My tongue's taken out of the mask.  And I got Gene Simmons permission in writing to use his mask.  Wow.  How much did that cost?  Free.  Free.  I was in Detroit Rock City.  You know, I was in that movie with him.  So I've known Gene many years. 
[01:47:30]  He hosted the Ponderosa with me, the Miss Nude North America.  I was hung out with Gene in various events.  Yeah.  You know, what film?  Oh, I dropped the name.  Gene Simmons.  No, so there, so that, but it was, it was, it was a big deal, this film.  And it was very disappointing when we all found out that, you know, that, that he was not into it.  Yeah.  So, you know.  He must have gotten flack from management.  Oh.  That must have just happened.  But as a courtesy to Kambi, I did say that he was not there in the actual studio doing the hardcore.  And we didn't use a microphone in any sex scenes.  That was a strong concern of everybody because of germophobia. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  We did shoot it on his chair, though.  And what I did do, I didn't say this at all on the air, but I'll say it now, we do, we pull one joke, me and Taylor Wayne, we do a sex scene on a chair, on a towel.  But then, as I'm ready to finish off, she jumps off the chair, we pull the towel off, I think I'm going to let go right smack on the chair, and I'm going, oh, oh, oh, just kidding.  You know, so we did a little fake out.  I figured he was going to, he, he was going to watch this.  Right.  And we find out later on that he was not into it, and we all felt a bit betrayed. 
[01:48:30]  You could say Howie.  We felt betrayed.  Howard was not into it.  No.  We thought he was.  Why wouldn't he be?  I would never care if people had sex in my chair.  Yeah, that would have been kind of cool to do, man.  I wanted 10%, Robin.  He offered nothing.  When he yelled, when he yelled at Elvis, what, messing around in his green room, saying you cannot have sex inside this studio ever, I'm on the radio back in Los Angeles going, what?  Uh-oh.  We just did a set, we just did a porn film there, you know, just a week ago.  Yeah.  I talked to Brett, Brett goes, well, he's not going to promote it.  That's great.  Now we find out a little bit later that he might not even be into it, might not even have given his permission. 
[01:49:00]  You know, staffers let us in, like at 4 o'clock, 4 o'clock in the morning, you know?  Yeah, that sounds like it.  They're all scum.  Snackers.  I don't know who they were or why.  It was, again, Brett's one of them.  We all walked in with him, you know?  Brett was Cabby's business partner.  But that's a large part of the book, you know, that discusses that.  And again, and I specifically say, you can see right there in the book, it says, since Brett  himself was booking talent, mentioning the studio and Howard, and was trying to sell the  movie using the name of Howard, he already ratted himself out. 
[01:49:30]  I was just, I'm putting it in a book, but he already, people already knew.  Yeah.  This isn't like earth striking.  It's not like you're breaking anything.  And Howard admitted he had inklings and heard things about it.  I never told anybody.  I never confirmed it with anyone, ever.  When Gary had asked, Casey had asked, you know, Stuttering John, Melrose, Larry Green  had all asked, I said, can't say a word.  And they really said, but I got to know this, if you ever did do a film, would you use the  microphone, like inserting that?  And he says, no.  I would never, the millionaires do that no matter what, if I ever did direct a film, 
[01:50:00]  you know, so.  Yeah.  That was the truth.  What year would that have been if it ever happened?  It did happen.  The book says it happened.  This is like the OJ interview.  If I were to make a porno movie in a radio studio.  Coincidentally, HarperCollins did that book and did my book.  HarperCollins dropped his book.  Yeah.  Judith Reagan.  That's the difference.  My book still exists.  It was, I don't remember exactly what year it was.  It was right around the time, it was about a year or two before Camby did that fight 
[01:50:30]  with Stuttering John in Atlantic City.  About a year and a half, two years before that.  Remember that Donald Trump?  I think his problems are a little more, a little bigger these days, Cabbys anyway,  than they were back then.  So, I think it matters.  I defended the fact that he's not the one who let us in and he was not in the studio at  the time.  He is in the movie.  He does do sex scenes.  But they're at a hotel with Taylor Wayne and in a warehouse that I made look like the  studio, like just pacing back and forth.  He was, you could see clearly in the film, it's not the studio.  Really?  It could look like a studio.  So, you know, so that's in all fairness to Cabbys. 
[01:51:00]  He was not actually in the studio.  So, I broke in here late at night and had sex on all these chairs.  You did.  I knew it.  Alone.  Brian.  Late at night.  You're an animal.  Did you wear the Gene Simmons mask?  And he did use the microphone.  I had the Gene Simmons mask on the whole kit and caboodle.  The whole deal.  You know, one of my first pornos that I was addicted to that I was like, that I saw at  my friend's house and I actually had to go into the bathroom by myself. 
[01:51:30]  I was so blown away by it.  It was actually a scene that Ron was in.  It was, you were a piano teacher and there was two girls, one had braces and that was  a Swedish erotica film.  I know exactly what you're talking about.  I remember that one.  The one with the braces, I for 20 years have been just, more than that, 25 years.  She's fantastic.  Those two girls.  That scene.  It's amazing how the early day porn stuff just sticks with you.  The stuff that turns you on a radio.  I love his review though.  The girls are better looking.  I had to go to the bathroom immediately.  Right.  It was an amazing film. 
[01:52:00]  He's an Indian boy and I was laying on his parents' bathroom mat in the bathroom.  Are you kidding, really?  Oh, no, no.  I wish I were.  You know how like in the paper they have to have like an icon to show the review?  Yeah.  They put a picture of a bathroom door closed.  Yeah.  Or a guy really running with the like streak marks off of him like he's got to run to the  bathroom.  And then maybe if it's not that good, he's just like this sulking kind of guy just walking  slowly to the bathroom.  But did I play good piano, Jim Norton?  I don't remember.  Yeah.  The voices were.  Are you a pianist? 
[01:52:30]  I play very good piano.  Good piano, violin, harmonica.  It's funny though.  You could tell the films from the early days because what?  The first video.  Well, the first thing you notice about old porn in like the early 80s.  A lot of hair.  That's number one.  A lot of hair.  And also, you notice that the girls were really into it then a lot.  I mean, they are now too.  The girls are much better looking today.  I mean, look at the girls up today.  The Jessie Janes, the Janine Lindwellers, the Jenna Jamesons.  The more ordinary looking girls back then.  Yeah, they're not really doing it for drugs anymore.  Not like the good old days. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, right.  I need rent money.  Oh, you.  It's true.  It's true.  Now the girls are pulling in a million bucks.  Back then, it was more like a hippy-dippy, fun, revolutionary, you know, against the Vietnam War, Woodstock kind of attitude.  And now it became, now it's a big, big business.  You're against the war.  All right, open your mouth.  Now there's acting involved.  Go to Vietnam.  Eat this instead.  They're too perfect now, a lot of the girls.  They're too perfect.  The lighting's too perfect.  Too perfect.  The women are too perfect. 
[01:53:30]  I like some of the old days.  You need a little skank.  Yes.  Just a little.  I want to hear a really fast great Dennis Hopp story in the book.  Real quick.  Yeah, hurry up.  We've got to take a break.  I was at the original Woodstock when I was 16 years old.  I was there for half an hour because, you know, I was working in the castles as a waiter, like all good Jewish boys.  So Fred Durst invited me to introduce him at the new Woodstock many years later.  And last minute, they canceled me.  They were using Mini-Me instead, Vern Troyer.  I was so depressed.  I was going to face a quarter million kids and go, please welcome, Limpus.  So I got canceled.  And everyone thought they were going to see me on the show. 
[01:54:00]  So Dennis Hopp, for the next year, had all the little Bunny Ranch girls call me on the phone like every week saying,  Ron, I'm real horny and I want to do you.  Oh, Mini-Me's here.  Got to go.  He put, when I did like a talk show with him at some studio in Hollywood, he'd have my star taken down and put their name Mini-Me instead.  So I'd eat at a restaurant and pick up my cup and saucer, Mini-Me's place setting.  You know, he was on my case for one full year about that.  Yeah, but it paid off and all the free sex he probably got you.  Yeah, probably.  Yeah, no kidding.  All right, so the book, Ron, Ron Jeremy, the hardest working man in showbiz, but working is in parentheses, obviously. 
[01:54:30]  I read like eight pages and honestly.  It's a good read.  It's brilliant.  Absolutely.  And great pictures.  A lot of great photos of some of the biggest stars in Hollywood are in there.  Right.  You can sell a lot of these.  Yeah, I think so.  Thanks, thanks, guys.  Are we promoting anything besides that?  Surreal life?  Surreal life fame games, which you can see on every Sunday and Thursdays on VH1.  Yeah.  And I got a couple of films coming out that were at Sundance that hopefully will do real well.  All right, very good.  Ron Jeremy, everyone.  Thanks, guys.  We'll talk to Brian Regan next.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:55:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Brian Regan in studio.  Hotty mouth, Brian Regan.  What happened?  Hotty mouth.  Hotty mouth, Brian Regan, right.  I'm sorry.  Brian's playing the Stanford Center tonight in Stanford, Connecticut.  Tomorrow, the State Theater in New Brunswick, New Jersey. 
[01:55:30]  And then it looks like, what would that be?  Saturday at the Borgata, Atlantic City.  That's very cool.  It's a little place called the Borgata, huh?  Nice.  I'm a circus barker.  I don't know who's headlining.  I'm supposed to be out front handing out leaflets.  You gamble?  Uh, not really.  When you play the casinos?  Oh, we've been, maybe, you know, 10, like, you know, 10,000 on the Super Bowl.  That's it.  I'm just picturing every comic that plays out at a casino blows all their money in the casino. 
[01:56:00]  See, I think of you people as being stupid and irresponsible, is what I'm saying.  But you've got to remember, Brian lives in Vegas.  I know.  That is a lot of temptation.  And he pretty much hates the casinos.  He's, like, part of that Vegas no one has ever seen or heard about, like, where normal people live.  Before I lived there, I was working in Las Vegas.  And, you know, there's, like, a bunch of comics at different places around Las Vegas.  And we all got together, and we were all playing craps.  And, no, no, no, roulette.  You know, the thing where you bet on the thing. 
[01:56:30]  The spinny wheel.  The spinny wheel.  And we're all coming up with various things to bet on, you know, pick your favorite number, whatever.  And we're all getting, having a couple, well, you know, drinks and stuff.  And everybody said, bet on how many minutes of your act you're proud of.  And we all piled it on eight.  And, of course, it didn't hit.  Of course not.  Eight minutes is about all we got.  And that's what I, I'm sorry.  No, that's it.  That's why they paid entertainers so much money in Vegas. 
[01:57:00]  They know that most of them are going to throw their money right back in the casino, man.  They're just going to go, especially, yeah, if it's not an in and, you know, you're in, you do your act, you leave.  Like you, you fly in, you do something, and then you're out.  You know, there are people there, though, for months on end.  Like my brother, for example, I know he likes poker.  And he's been playing there for about a month now.  And he should be back next week.  He's not playing poker for a month.  It's lasting a month.  Yeah, a month-long game.  No, he's playing, he's in a band, but he's playing at a casino hotel out there. 
[01:57:30]  That's cool.  And I just picture him coming back with less money than he left with because I just know him.  He's probably playing poker and taking the gig money and losing everything that he makes.  Yeah.  It's just that kind of thing.  I know I'd be tempted.  I kind of like playing cards.  And it's a good thing I don't live like right near a casino because I would probably just be one of those people that just end up destitute.  I just don't have that feeling. 
[01:58:00]  I mean, I like to sit down and play blackjack.  You know, like a good like run on something where you're sitting there for hours and hours on end.  I'm like a $200 guy.  You know what I mean?  It's like play blackjack with $200 if it's gone.  I am too.  A hand.  You play fantasy football?  Yes.  Yeah.  I heard you guys were talking about the fantasy thing.  You know, and I'm not overly into it, but you know how you have to check the injury reports, you know?  Yeah.  I guess that would be important.  Sure.  Start your guy or whatever.  And it kills me how, you know, they boil down an injury to the name of a body part. 
[01:58:30]  I mean, can you imagine a doctor giving you that diagnosis?  You know, you're sitting on the table and he walks in.  And we got the results back, CAT scan results are in and the blood tests.  We had to analyze those.  And, of course, we were waiting on the results of the stress test as well.  And you might want to sit down because you have what we in the medical community refer to as knee. 
[01:59:00]  What the hell could that be?  How many different bones and tendons and things there are in a knee?  And they just say, he's got a knee.  He's out.  What's the matter with him?  Knee.  It's his knee.  It's probably the most complex bending joint on the human body.  Well, what's the matter with it?  Well, your knee.  Your knee hurts.  And I thought I knew that when I came in here. 
[01:59:30]  A list in the paper, yeah.  Yeah.  Knee.  Elbow.  Elbow.  Go to your psychiatrist.  We figured it out.  It's head.  Your head.  You're all mixed up up in there.  Just try to straighten yourself out.  What do you do if one of your players in fantasy football left, Dan?  You sub?  Yeah, you just pitch your lineup every week.  Don't you say it to me like I should know?  That's why I'm asking.  He's a sub, Anthony. 
[02:00:00]  You sub, idiot.  We're just psyched that we finally got something on you.  So we're going to push it hard.  I know nothing.  He knows everything.  And this came up.  He knows a little bit about everything.  So we finally got something on him.  Of course it's going to happen.  Nothing about fantasy football.  And it came up the other day in conversation.  I was talking with my girlfriend about it.  And we were sitting there.  And, of course, she knew nothing of fantasy football.  And I know nothing.  And we're trying to figure it out between ourselves.  And nothing was working.  I go, no, it can't work like that. 
[02:00:30]  Because then this wouldn't.  You know, what happens if this situation.  We're just coming up with situations why it wouldn't work.  We came up with a brand new fantasy football that would be fun to play.  And completely unintelligible to explain.  Just the worst version of it.  We got to get the word out on that.  What kind of shoes was he wearing?  But thank you, Thang.  Now I know.  Yeah.  Now I know.  You know what kills me, too, is, you know, with the steroid thing.  When the, you know, obviously it's a problem with all the sports. 
[02:01:00]  And when an athlete says he never knowingly took the word.  I completely don't understand it.  How naive can a human being be?  Excuse me.  Why do you keep sticking that needle in my butt?  Ow.  Again.  With the needle in the butt periodically.  How come you don't answer my queries?  He didn't know what was going on.  He didn't know.  Not knowingly.  Not knowingly. 
[02:01:30]  I wasn't aware of this.  Oh, right there.  That tells you.  Not knowingly.  Yeah, that is.  I like how they try to pawn it off on something just like.  Something ridiculous.  I did have some Avion water.  How about the, what was it, the guy who won the Tour de France?  He had like.  Yeah.  Like four days in a row.  He had a different reason.  You know, I had two beers.  Well, that wouldn't raise your levels.  And then they tell him, yeah.  Well, then I overslept.  You know, I've got hay fever. 
[02:02:00]  Well, none of those explain the high levels.  Yeah, everybody.  I had a lot of coffee.  I had a lot of coffee that day, you know.  Well, coffee in very high doses could do it.  Coffee, then.  Then I'm sticking with the coffee.  Let's go to Chris in Florida.  Chris, what's up?  What's up, boys?  How are you?  Pretty good.  We got Brian Reagan in studio.  Brian, I'm sorry that you don't spend any money gambling.  I think you spent it all on your car, didn't you?  Oh, no.  That car, I have to commend you.  As a car guy, that car is amazing. 
[02:02:30]  If Anthony don't know about it, it's just.  I will know about it shortly, Brian.  What do you have?  I'm not sure.  I've got a Gremlin.  That's a nice car.  The old AMC Gremlin or Pacer.  I'll punch you out, boys.  Thanks.  Well, what do you mean by this, Chris?  Is there.  I don't know.  Is he trying to set you up for a bit?  I think he's setting me up on a bit, but I don't know.  You don't know the bit.  Are you a car guy?  Not really.  Did you spend a lot of money on a vehicle? 
[02:03:00]  I have a car.  That's about it.  You're a practical guy.  Yeah.  You really are.  And you know what I have, too?  A home.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I got the family, so I got both those things.  A house and a car.  Don't you hate when you're driving your car to go home and you see some stupid political ad?  It's aggravating.  Yeah.  And it starts making you think, maybe if I hadn't had those Pop-Tarts this morning, I wouldn't 
[02:03:30]  all be hopped up on sugar worried about this political ad.  You know what?  When you see a political ad on the side of the road, a billboard?  Yeah.  I like the way they have a candidate's name and two one-word qualities.  That's all you need to make an informed decision.  Steve Roberts.  Leadership.  Integrity.  Say no more.  Say no more, you.  The only way that would be helpful is if his opponent had a billboard right next to it. 
[02:04:00]  You know, Bobby Wilson, laziness, thievery.  I don't think so.  No.  Not with this one over here.  When you compare those qualities, this one over here is a little better.  Did you see the political ad?  This is true.  During the last election, you know how they have the negative ads? 
[02:04:30]  Oh, yeah.  And there was one.  I'm not making this up.  You know how they just try to find something that the guy voted on.  So this is an actual negative political ad.  They said, he voted to allow seven-year-olds to be tasered.  That's the absolute truth.  And they interviewed the guy.  And he said, oh, that.  Well, I meant like if a little kid gets a gun or something, you know, you don't want to hurt the kid.  Worst case scenario, you know, you taser him so you don't kill him, you know.  As if that was the guy's platform. 
[02:05:00]  I want to taser seven-year-olds.  He's talking with his staff.  If I'm elected, can we have the seven-year-olds on the stage with me?  Can I swear in and begin tasering them?  Yes, I said.  I want to taser.  How many seven-year-olds can we have for the induction ceremony?  That's brilliant.  We talked about that during the campaign.  Love the political ads.  Because they don't explain why they have them.  Yeah, they never explain anything.  30 seconds.  It's 30 seconds. 
[02:05:30]  They can't possibly.  30 seconds.  And a lot of those, they'll say, like, he voted against funding AIDS programs.  You know, like, what the?  Who would?  Right.  Why would you say something like AIDS?  Don't even care.  Go ahead.  Or, you know, he voted against voting for money to go to childhood diseases.  It's like, how do you get that bill and go, nope, that's not it.  And then you realize you do a little, I mean, a micro research on the subject.  And you realize it's one of those bills that was attached to some highway bill that gives 
[02:06:00]  this guy a lot of money that's attached to another thing.  It's like a line of bills that the guy said, no, this was one of the things on it.  Part of it.  Yeah, part of it.  But they pull that one out and go, fuck.  There was one I heard where they said he, what?  He voted to kill kindergarten legislation.  Kill.  When you hear kill.  That doesn't explain what the legislation was.  What do you hear kill in kindergarten?  He voted to kill kindergarten legislation. 
[02:06:30]  What is he, Satan?  How could you vote against kindergarten legislation?  What legislation?  You get those guys, they just don't spell it out for you.  No.  And they do like key words like that, like kill kindergarten.  You think he's killing kindergartners?  What did I do?  I barely heard that.  Wait.  Oh, no.  This is the one that wants to kill the kindergartners.  No, we don't want to vote for him.  Wait, we want the one who wants kindergartners to live. 
[02:07:00]  That's the one we should vote for.  My favorite ones, though, and it's a new attack that they're taking on this one, is to take any audio they have of their opponent.  It doesn't matter if it was a speech, a conversation on an interview show, and they make it staticky and very high-end-y, so it sounds like some hidden tape recording wiretap.  And you hear the guy going like, a Smith guy is somebody we've got to make sure doesn't get in our way. 
[02:07:30]  It's like, he doesn't want the Smith getting in his way.  How will he eliminate him?  You're just thinking, oh, my God, they tapped his house, and he's planning a hit.  He's part of the mob.  He's planning a hit.  He's planning a hit for this guy.  No one talks with that type of tone.  Here he is talking with Democratic bosses about legislation.  There's no way we're going to have this pass.  If I've got to see this go from...  Well, you heard it yourself.  In a squeaky, staticky way.  That can only mean evil. 
[02:08:00]  What the hell?  Guys, can you say the most innocent thing?  Honey, I'd like to have dinner by 6.  I'll be home a little late.  I'm at a meeting.  A meeting?  What was that meeting about?  What the hell?  He's calling his wife.  They are the worst dregs.  We love the election because we did nothing but nonstop play that.  Oh, we had fun with that.  Good old Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  We pushed the candidate. 
[02:08:30]  We had no idea what his platform was, but we pushed it just for the fact that he sounded  like a dope.  Because his stuff was so ridiculous.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  We had to push the guy.  We got him on the phone.  He seemed like a fun enough guy, but he was one of the real right-wing conservative guys.  And he wouldn't fess up much to anything.  And he didn't have a chance in hell of winning, but he was so fun to talk to.  Well, we got to move over to XM.  You joining us today, Brian?  Are you...  I can join you for a bit.  A little bit?  A little bit.  All right.  We'll walk in the cold.  Yeah.  Brian Regan's going to be at Stanford Center tonight in Stanford, Connecticut. 
[02:09:00]  Tomorrow night, the State Theater in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  And Saturday at the Borgata in Atlantic City.  Brian Regan, I mean, just go and see him.  Absolutely amazing.  One of the funniest guys we know, easily.  I will not be here tomorrow.  I'm glad at all.  What?  Oh, no.  What happened?  I will be in Albany tomorrow and Saturday night.  I don't have to compete with Regan.  I'm very happy.  Albany?  At the Comedy Works in Albany.  So if you're around, go.  All right.  See Jimmy.  All right.  Jimmy, we'll see you next week.  Yes.  Oh, no.  We'll see you over at XM. 
[02:09:30]  We continue.  If you're not joining us, have a great day.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:10:00]  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. 
[02:10:30]  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Thank you. 
[02:11:00]  Thank you. 
[02:11:30]  Thank you. 
[02:12:00]  Thank you. 
[02:12:30]  Thank you. 
[02:13:00]  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:13:30]  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver. 
[02:14:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  All right.  We got something to talk about.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thanks for joining us here over here.  Over?  Over here.  Over here.  Over here at XM Satellite Radio.  Brian Regan joined the program.  Very, very, very happy to see that he made the walk with us.  Oh, it's so nice to actually sit here and feel good.  And Jimmy and Brian are talking about doing comedy for a living. 
[02:14:30]  And because of that, you fly all over the country every weekend.  And you're in first class.  And you're sitting with guys in suits and ties.  I don't always fly first.  But a lot of times I'm able to upgrade.  Or a lot of times I'm able to if it's not crazy.  Nice to be afforded the lifestyle.  Able to a lot of times.  To upgrade or to just be able to.  You know, if you travel a lot, especially you guys, you can't put yourself in this situation.  It's not like you're going on one family vacation a year and you all just get in to coach and fly that way. 
[02:15:00]  It's nice that you can afford some of the amenities that are available to you frequent flyers.  And Brian raised a good point about just flying up in the front.  Flying up front.  Well, you're sitting there and, you know, we can wear jeans and sneakers and T-shirts.  And everybody around you has got business suits on and ties.  They must think, how the hell did this guy get up here, you know?  But you feel, you know, you don't say anything. 
[02:15:30]  But you want to rub it in.  You know, those ties.  How do you tie them?  Because I don't have to in my world.  What's better than dressing like a bum in sweatpants and a fucking Sabbath shirt and sitting next to some shithead?  I almost caught myself into some shithead who went to medical school and I'm like, he saves lives.  I know.  A shithead.  And that's why he's a shithead.  He has to work really hard.  But what stinks is when you're boarding, you know, and it's like everybody, the first class gets to board first.  And they just keep stepping in front of you because you've got, like, sneakers on. 
[02:16:00]  And it's like, excuse me, excuse me, coach boy.  No, I have a ticket for it up there, too.  Well, I could sit in the front.  Why do the people insist on lining up like that when they know first class board's first?  And believe me, that is the only reason.  Seats are nice, everything.  But just that I could get on first.  That's what I like about it.  And then people line up and kind of block the way.  I'll tell you what.  There are frequent flyers who are getting in a platinum call, a call for the elite call. 
[02:16:30]  So they're going to get on before the rest of coach.  Not before me, motherfucker.  That's what I say.  Everybody has the upgrade.  There's like three people on the whole plane who don't have pre-boarding.  They should just say those three names.  You guys just sit and wait while the rest of us get on.  Everyone else upgraded.  We will now begin boarding the rest of the aircraft, seat 23B.  You can board.  You can go work your way back to your middle seat. 
[02:17:00]  When I used to fly to open for DICE, one of the perks for Club Store to Kenny was he flew first class.  Andrew flew him first class.  And I remember one time we were flying, and sometimes I would upgrade,  and Kenny was trying to cut the line because they had already started boarding coach and he got there late.  And they're like, well, so you're going to have to wait?  And I'll never forget.  He goes, but I'm first class.  That's not fair.  That's not fair.  Fucking asshole.  What is he, five?  What a dick.  But people are idiots, man.  The way they mob around that door. 
[02:17:30]  I completely don't get it.  You have a boarding pass with a seat assignment.  You're getting on the plane, and you're going to sit where you're supposed to.  What is this?  And the gate agents try to organize it.  They try so hard.  They try so hard.  It's like, ladies and gentlemen, we're about to begin our boarding process.  If everyone could just please remain seated.  Everyone, please, please remain seated.  Please, please, back away from the gate.  Please, back away from the gate.  I think they just need to start shooting people.  Just take one out. 
[02:18:00]  You get one.  All you need is one.  You just want that example.  You shoot one person, and then everybody goes, oh, my God.  That's why all the rest of the crap is just, it's bullshit.  When, you know, leave, let's say, because everybody, you know, if there's a disaster,  God forbid, and the plane goes down, everyone's dead anyway, but if on the rare occasion you  did have some type of emergency landing where people did have to leave in an orderly fashion,  you can't get on the fucking plane in an orderly fashion. 
[02:18:30]  How are they getting off when it's smoldering, could explode at any moment, there's injured  people, and you're going to, I'll just wait here until you, you first, because I know  that the children, I'm working the emergency door.  I made a deal with the person that I would help people get out.  I've given my solemn vow.  Yeah.  Boy, is that the most, like, noncommittal thing that could ever be given to somebody.  You're sitting in an emergency row.  Yeah, I know.  You know how to work at this, and you will help other people get out. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, sure.  And that's it.  That's the whole job interview.  For the most important thing on the plane, they just say, would you be willing to do this?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, why not?  It's not even a sign here, or anything, just a verbal.  And you're hired.  There's no, they don't, they don't check your background, nothing.  No.  And the only reason you say yeah is because you don't want to move.  You want the leg room?  You want the leg room?  I'm already here.  And in the rare instance that there is disaster, you're so out there first, it doesn't even 
[02:19:30]  matter.  You're just going to shake the door and panic anyway and go, help, help.  They don't even tell you how it works.  You know, I wouldn't be able to open that thing.  I was on a flight to Houston recently, and everyone is so fucking selfish.  They said, look, we're a little late, so we have connecting flights that are just about  going to make it.  Can you please, everyone who does not have a connecting flight, please just stay seated  for an extra five minutes.  I don't even know why they say that.  Why bother?  Apparently every piece of shit on that flight, including me, had a connecting flight.  I was on a flight from baggage to hotel. 
[02:20:00]  That's a flight I had to pay.  Every piece of shit stood up.  I got to catch my shuttle over to my hotel room.  It only comes every five minutes, and I really want to make that one that's out there.  I got to be there, man.  We don't care about each other at all.  No.  Hey, we were talking about political ads over at the other joint, and we got the Paul  R. Nelson clip.  We haven't played in a long time, and Brian's here.  Is it the ad?  This is the guy you were supporting.  This is the actual ad.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  This is, yeah, we heard this, and we're like, we got to get everyone voting for the 
[02:20:30]  guy.  Ten years ago, liberal lawyer Ron Kind was elected to Congress, and he's done almost  nothing in the Congress since.  And that's a good thing, because just about everything he's tried to do has been wrong.  Ron Kind voted to take the words under God out of the Pledge of Allegiance.  He voted to strip the Ten Commandments from our public buildings.  Ron Kind repeatedly voted for gay marriage and to force the Boy Scouts to accept homosexual  leaders. 
[02:21:00]  He even voted to let illegal aliens burn the American flag.  For Congress, Ron Kind is the wrong kind.  Ah.  The right kind of Congressman is Paul R. Nelson.  This former Marine is a father of four who supports Wisconsin values.  Paul R. Nelson will work to stop illegal immigration, to end our dependence on foreign oil, to win  the war on terror, and to defend traditional marriage.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, and I approve of this message. 
[02:21:30]  Paid for by Paul R. Nelson for Congress.  Oh, is that crazy?  That's not the one with the sex study.  That music.  The music.  I'm going to think of what that instrument was.  He wants gay men to come in and have sex with your children.  Roar.  And the great line about Paul R. Nelson is he voted to win the war on terror.  Like, Ron Kind was like, we have to somehow get more troops killed.  We need to lose this war. 
[02:22:00]  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I think that was the first one.  Then he really got aggressive.  Yeah, I believe.  With our servicemen and women facing death every day,  what kind of congressman would try to gut military spending?  The wrong kind.  Ron Kind.  That's right.  Congressman Ron Kind is repeatedly voted to deprive our troops of the funding they need to fight for us.  But Ron Kind has no trouble spending your money.  He would just rather spend it on sex.  That's right.  Instead of spending money on cancer research, 
[02:22:30]  Ron Kind voted to spend your money to study the sex lives of Vietnamese prostitutes.  Instead of spending money to study heart disease,  Ron Kind spent your money to study the masturbation habits of old men.  Ron Kind spent your tax dollars to study something called the bisexual, transgendered,  and two-spirited Aleutian Eskimos, whoever they are.  Ron Kind even spent your tax dollars to pay teenage girls to watch pornographic movies  with probes connected to their genitalia.  Ron Kind pays for sex.  But not for soldiers. 
[02:23:00]  If Ron Kind had better priorities, you wouldn't be having to hear this.  Ron Kind is out of touch, and soon he'll be out of Congress.  I'm Paul R. Nelson, and I approve of this message.  I would love to see that stack of bills that he voted for,  and they all just say that one thing on them, you know,  attaching the electrodes to the genitalia.  Yes, where do I sign for that?  Teen genitals, electrodes.  Give me my pen.  Quickly.  I'm Ron Kind.  We had so much fun with that ad. 
[02:23:30]  How the fuck does anybody put an ad out like that, and it's serious?  By the way, Paul R. Nelson, he lost.  Lost.  Wrong Kind won by a landslide.  A landslide.  They believe in Ron Kind.  They want electrodes hooked up to teen girls' genitals.  In Wisconsin, apparently.  Only Aleutian X knows they have to do.  Do they suck pussy?  Do they suck cock?  What are the Aleutian X?  I don't know what they do, but I want to know.  I have to know.  Only Ron Kind can let us know.  Paul R. Nelson wants to pay for troops or something. 
[02:24:00]  He'll be family traditional wedding vows.  The masturbation habits of old men.  Of old men.  And the whole condescending delivery that guy has.  Ron Kind wanted to...  Listen to this one.  Here's a hot one.  But Paul R. Nelson in the music channel.  It's all patriotic.  Listen to this dolt.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Listen, I'm Paul R. Nelson.  So like the report about the masturbation habits of the old men. 
[02:24:30]  Are there actual like big report books, you know, like with binders?  Like there's seven of them you'd have on a desk.  Here's the results of the scientific study of the old men masturbation story.  We'll have to paw through these for quite a while.  But hurrah, hurrah, hurrah.  We got the results.  Right.  Oh, man.  They just don't...  America just seems to eat this shit up, though. 
[02:25:00]  I love it.  I love a good negative mud-slinging campaign.  Anyway.  The Jersey one was fantastic, too.  That was one where they were doing a lot of the mob boss kind of delivery.  We haven't played these in a while.  And Brian got us going with this.  Where it sounded like they were tape recording someone with a wire on.  And then they morph like half the guys into Hitler.  You know, they just take the right space.  Yeah, yeah.  That's another one.  Yeah.  And then just morph it into Adolf Hitler.  Because...  Someone else had these priorities. 
[02:25:30]  Someone you might have known as Adolf Hitler.  What?  It's easy to do the hair swoop and the mustache.  You can photoshop a 10-year-old.  You can photoshop that.  The candidate's eating strudel.  And they somehow connect that to the slaughter of Jews.  Let's go to Tony in Wisconsin.  Tony.  Did you say Paul R. Nelson?  Oh, he must want to hear a wild song.  Yeah, but Brian doesn't have much time.  We don't want to waste Brian's time. 
[02:26:00]  We'll play that later, though.  Maybe going into break, we will.  Yeah, we'll definitely want to hear it.  If you want to break, someone else call up and ask for it, and we'll do that.  All right.  Let's go to Shwuggy in Jersey.  Shwuggy.  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Hey, Shwuggy.  Hey, Brian.  What's going on?  What's going on, man?  Hey, Brian.  Speaking of cars, I was coming to work today, and it was a big traffic jam, and I'm so sick  of that.  Any ideas how we can clear this up?  Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  Every city, and I do this in my act, but I truly believe that every city should do this. 
[02:26:30]  Every city should invest in a magnet copter that all it does is patrol the city, this  big, giant, industrial helicopter.  Because, you know, a lot of times you're stuck behind, and it's like a broken down car.  It's like a overheated car, and you've got 10,000 people who are waiting because of this  thing.  Every city should have an industrial magnet copter.  All it does is patrol, and there's a big cable that dangles with it with a magnet.  And all it does is pick up these garbage hunks of jalopy and just toss them over on the  side of the road. 
[02:27:00]  Good luck with your problems over there.  The rights of the thousands of motorists behind you must supersede whatever additional  damage we just did to your garbage vehicle.  And that's all it is.  It just drops it in some grassy area and then goes off to another part of the city to unclog  the arteries.  That is brilliant.  The highways for jalopy.  Not only is that a joke, that is a brilliant invention.  I truly think they should do this. 
[02:27:30]  Just clear the arteries, man.  Getting stuck in traffic is a staple here in New York because of the Long Island Expressway  trying to drive out.  It's notorious.  Known, the whole country, as one of the worst roads ever.  It's an abomination.  And it's mostly because people don't know how to drive.  I would love it if it was a mechanical problem or something.  At least then the guy's got an excuse.  When it's just someone in the left lane doing 45 miles an hour, there's no one in front of 
[02:28:00]  them.  So don't even think about your rear view mirror.  But the fact that there's no one in front of you should tell you there must be a lot  of people behind me because I know this road is used to commute into the pinnacle of the  free world, New York City.  So I believe that there's a few people.  If they glanced in the mirror, they would see it.  I kind of like the idea of having, I thought of a trap door, but I thought that would be  a little bit, some injury might happen if a trap door opened up and the car would just 
[02:28:30]  plummet.  But it could be a ramp that would open up and now your car like, and it surprises you.  You're doing like 45 and there's someone watching on a traffic camera who goes, here  he comes, here he comes.  And boom, you hit the button.  A ramp opens up.  You go down to a road that consists of nothing but people that drive like you.  Slow people.  It's one lane of slow people that now have to stay in that lane to drive wherever they  want.  And everyone else can just go as fast as they want. 
[02:29:00]  But what about the guy doing 70 behind you beeping?  He'd probably go down the ramp with you.  That's a very fast ramp.  It snaps right back up again.  It's like a mousetrap ramp.  It's a mousetrap ramp.  It's science you can't understand.  It's a map.  Yeah.  Jimmy, it's light years ahead of your thinking.  Don't even try to absorb it.  And a big problem is people rubbernecking is a problem.  Even if they move the thing, even if that worked, people would just rubberneck it.  You had the same traffic.  Look at the helicopter.  He's flinging the jalopy.  And everyone would slow down and we'd need more helicopters. 
[02:29:30]  More magnet copters.  Magnet copters.  Hey, let's say hi to Chris in Toronto.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, everyone.  How are you?  All right.  Hey.  Hey, Brian, is your show all ages?  I got tickets for your show on March 2nd.  It's ages 75 and up.  All right.  No, it's weird because there are some theaters that every now and then somebody might bring  a kid in.  But, you know, I do talk about, I'm not dirty, but I do talk about things that would make 
[02:30:00]  kids' eyes glaze over, you know, cholesterol jokes and buying a mortgage, you know.  I mean, they won't be offended, but I don't know how much.  And I have some stuff that they would like as well, so I don't know.  You know what's good?  Infants.  Bring them to the show so they could start crying in the middle of a comedy show.  By the way, sorry, Brian.  I thought that was a setup to a bit.  Oh, it might have been.  And I'm so dumb, I don't even know.  I mean, I thought you had a PG-13 bit or something.  How long is your set?  On tickets to the show bit. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  I do about an hour and 15, I guess.  You have an opener or just you?  An opener.  Cool.  Yeah.  Probably really filthy.  Some dirty fucking Otto and George and Brian Regan.  Sometimes his brother.  Oh, sometimes Dennis Open.  Yeah, who's terrific in his own right.  Let's say hi to Ron and, oh, he's part of the NYPD.  Ron, what's up?  How's everything?  Hey, good.  Listen, Brian, I remember a couple of years ago, he talked about driving.  You got pulled over and you had a suspended license in Manhattan.  Do you remember that? 
[02:31:00]  Suspended license and a what?  No, your driver's license.  Didn't you get stopped in Manhattan one day and get a suspended driver's license?  I did.  That was me.  This must be the cop.  Who?  Oh, you did?  I did, yes.  That was Norton.  And I got stopped going up to the studio and they were going to arrest me until I proved  I was on the Opie and Anthony show.  Wow.  Is that the criteria?  Either driver's license or are you a member of the Opie and Anthony show?  All right, you're free to go.  License and registration or else some type of certification that you're a regular on 
[02:31:30]  the Opie and Anthony show.  All right, see your ONA card for you're free to go.  I would love to just come out of a bank with a bag of money and a gun and a mask and  just go, ONA, Opie and Anthony show, I'm Anthony.  Okay.  All right, you're free to go.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Love that show.  They don't seem to, okay, we're above the law.  I agree.  What is a no-nonsense judge?  I hear that all the time.  A no-nonsense judge presided over the trial as opposed to what? 
[02:32:00]  A typical judge, you know, who starts a trial.  Okay, I would like to let everybody know I am a nonsense judge.  I will be encouraging all types of nonsense.  In fact, if anyone says anything that makes sense, I'll overrule it.  Let the nonsense begin.  And then he spins a propeller on his beanie.  Woo-hoo!  I want a no-nonsense judge. 
[02:32:30]  I don't have a comment for that.  I'm pondering it.  I'm pondering the nonsense judge.  Why do they add in those stupid words like that?  You know what was killing me during the Saddam Hussein trial?  Yeah.  They could not get the man to stop standing up and yelling.  You know, they're trying to form a new government.  They're trying to, you know, show that they have some authority. 
[02:33:00]  And every ten seconds, he's just,  You're done!  We're done!  Can you sit down, please?  Do we have any laws against this?  Do we have any laws yet?  Can that be the first law?  That he has to stop doing that all the time?  I think it hurt him in the end.  Yeah.  I don't think his technique.  I don't think it worked out.  It really played well.  I don't think.  He didn't get the sympathy.  If that was what his defense attorney was suggesting, 
[02:33:30]  I don't, it's malpractice or something.  Stand up and yell.  Yeah, and I don't think the appeals process really was long enough  to address the fact that his attorney was telling him to stand up and yell.  Excuse me, the appeals process, I'd like to start by,  It's over?  What?  Put my coat and hat on, I'm going where?  To Applebee's?  Yeah.  They did that quick, didn't they?  Oh my God.  When you walk into the gallows,  I mean, that's the...  When you walk into the gallows with your,  we're going out to dinner coat and hat on, 
[02:34:00]  I don't think you're being told the truth as to where you're going.  They don't play games, man.  Oh!  Over here, it's what, 10 year minimum or something like that?  At least 10.  There are people who've been 20 years on death row.  And there, it's like, okay, well, you've been convicted, Saddam,  this is kind of serious.  You do have an appeal.  That will last two days.  And then you have to be executed within,  I think it's 30 days of the appeal.  And they did it five days later. 
[02:34:30]  They didn't even give him the 30 days he was allowed.  Up to 30 days.  Yeah, up to 30 days, which means immediately.  There are some, I saw one time they did an execution here in the United States,  and they did it at 7 o'clock in the morning,  which I just thought was like an added amount of torture to the guy.  7 a.m.  Is the guy supposed to get some sleep the night before?  Yeah, I think I'm going to hit the rack.  Yeah, I got a short day tomorrow. 
[02:35:00]  Turn in early.  7 a.m.  Do it at midnight, man, you know?  Give the guy one last break.  Is that an all-nighter?  Yeah.  Do you just pull an all-nighter when the next day is your execution?  Wouldn't that be like the ultimate cool story that you sleep until 6.30 that day?  And they have trouble waking you up.  Man, he's sleeping soundly, man.  I hate to wake you up, but...  Trouble waking you up to kill you.  Did you forget what we had on the schedule? 
[02:35:30]  Did you remember we had to go over the upcoming schedule for the week?  I told you to set two alarms.  Oh, man, I'm sorry.  I forgot.  That's today?  Oh, I set one near the bed, and I got to set one away.  I got to have two alarms.  Remind me to set a backup alarm.  Tom, I am so sorry.  I'm embarrassed.  Let's go to Tom in Jersey.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning, Tom.  You guys suck.  Thank you, sir. 
[02:36:00]  You're very welcome.  I saw Brian Regan.  Hi, Brian.  Hey, man.  I saw Brian Regan on many occasions.  Thank you.  One particular time at the Stress Factory in New Brunswick, we pushed him to the point,  you know, as typical ONA fashion, the fans, pushed him to the point where we were screaming  out bits.  And one particular point, he was up to drink a sip of water.  And a buddy of mine who was with us said, drink water.  And Brian slams the water glass down on the stage and says, I'm not doing that one. 
[02:36:30]  I'm not doing that one.  I didn't remember that.  That's cool.  Yeah, the fans got to leave him alone to do his act.  The best thing you could do is sit down and shut up and watch Brian.  Hey, man.  That's like a good problem, though, man.  I'm glad people seem to like it.  No, it's not.  You want to kill them.  He's got a lot of great new material, too.  Smoke and Fish from Dallas.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey, I've seen Brian Regan down in Dallas twice, and I cry every time.  I feel like the biggest baby. 
[02:37:00]  It's so hilarious.  But every time he comes to the end where he's yelling out bits, I always yell out the same  bit.  I feel like an idiot.  But Godzilla, man, that's an oldie.  Godzilla.  I haven't heard you do that in a long time.  And when you talk about how the sound for Godzilla came up.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I enjoy the Godzilla movies.  And I don't know how they came up with the noise that the monster makes.  You know, the...  And I just imagine, well, they must have held auditions.  I figure the Japanese movie producers held auditions, you know, and it's like, we have 
[02:37:30]  a scary monster movie.  We need a scary monster voice.  Do you have a good one?  Well, let me try one for you.  All right.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  He's a bigger monster.  He's a bigger monster.  I have to be more scarier. 
[02:38:00]  More scarier.  Oh, okay.  I got a big monster.  Okay.  Oh, girl.  I'm bigger and scarier.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  He's a huge.  He's a huge monster.  I have to be...  Okay.  That's a...  That's a perfect.  That's a perfect.  And I just wonder, the guy who got the part, if he had to...  When he was learning his lines, like if he would practice his lines with his wife. 
[02:38:30]  Honey.  Honey, I got the Godzilla part.  Yeah, would you read lines with me?  Oh, sure.  Sure, okay.  Um, oh, no, here, here he comes.  Oh, no, this is going to be bad for the whole town.  Oh, no, he's, he's going the other way. 
[02:39:00]  Thank goodness.  No, no, you don't have, you don't have a line there.  You know, it says Godzilla exits.  Yeah, but I thought, you know, as my tail was going over the hill, or, you know, like,  ah, no, no, it says Godzilla exits.  There's no line.  You don't have a line there.  Yeah, I know, but I thought, you know, ah, no, it says, it says you don't have a line there.  No, there was no improv-ing with the Godzilla lines. 
[02:39:30]  Do you know what I love about that bit is watching him turn red, and also the fact that all of a sudden the actor and his wife are not Japanese.  It's like they learn for the first second of the bit, and then they just are no longer Japanese.  Think about that.  I wonder if people in the audience are going, there's some inconsistency here.  Right.  The actor should be obviously Japanese.  Well, at the beginning of the audition, the actor is, I have a noise for you.  And then, like, ten minutes later, he's like, I don't know what to do. 
[02:40:00]  So, they're all works in progress.  Let's go to Eric in Pennsylvania.  Eric.  Hey, I just called to say, again, love the show, and I just wanted to say I saw Brian a few months back in Scranton, Pennsylvania.  Yeah.  And I remember hearing about you guys saying how the pests always give him such a hard time when he's on stage.  And it got me worried because he said, well, tonight my family's here.  And I was thinking, great, they're going to jump on him, and his family's going to think, oh, my God, you know, what's he going to do? 
[02:40:30]  And I was just wondering, you know, he said he was from Scranton?  My dad is from Scranton.  Wondering where?  Oh, okay.  My mom and dad grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Binghamton, New York.  So, I've got a lot of relatives from my dad's side of the family up there.  So, it was kind of cool playing there, you know?  Yeah, that was a great show.  Thank you.  And one other question.  Your set was just amazing.  It was all brand new, but it seemed to be a little bit edgier. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah?  It seemed to be, it didn't seem to be so many character, child-based stories.  It was more up-to-date and edgy.  Oh, wow.  Thank you.  What made you decide to go that direction with this new set?  Well, I knew Jim Norton wasn't around, so I stole all his stuff.  Thanks for the call, Charlie Rose.  Thank you.  I know.  Are you a reporter?  You got that reporter delivery there.  Jesus.  Can you ask the worst question to a great comic?  Well, technically speaking, he sounds like a reporter, doesn't he?  I appreciate the compliment. 
[02:41:30]  Are you getting edgier, Brian?  A little bit?  You know, that word, everybody likes to throw that word on themselves, so I don't know, man.  I just like to keep writing, you know?  Yeah.  And hopefully it's new to people who are familiar with the older stuff.  It's nice to do some new stuff.  You run through phases.  Like, sometimes he's a performer, you write a certain way, your head's working a certain  way, other times it's working another way.  It's just weird.  I heard you hit the stage now like Michael Richards, and you just go off for a little  while.  I have a foreword in the audience.  Don't talk amongst yourselves at a table.  Yes.  I will release a racist tirade that will be on the news for weeks. 
[02:42:00]  Man, that was rough, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  That was even rougher us.  Yeah, I mean, everyone watched that, and as a comic, you guys just watching it, oh,  no.  It's weird because, you know, we've all been on that side of it where people won't shut  up, so you could, I can relate to the anger, you know, but, you know.  But how far he went with it, obviously.  Maybe you ought to, oof.  I just can't relate to his courage and honesty.  I mean, oh, boy, if I wanted to yell that in the cellar, fucking yapping in the back. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, no funny at all.  Just hurt people on a fucking deep level and then go.  One time I felt really guilty because these people, like, wouldn't shut up, and I, you  know, finally I had enough, and I went, shucks, fellas.  Wow.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And I'm just glad somebody didn't have a cell phone camera because that would have been  your career right there.  That would have been all over.  Shucks.  I could see the people on the news with the graphic up behind them of your face with triple  X, red X's over it. 
[02:43:00]  That's right.  The S, S, H, asterisk, asterisk, asterisk, K, asterisk.  How does that, you know, when they bleep out a word, what is the offensive part of the  word?  Because sometimes they'll literally have the first consonant sound and the last consonant  sound and get rid of the U in the middle.  Yeah.  That was our trick.  That was our old trick.  It's like, oh, go fuck yourself.  Oh, stop, you piece of shit.  It just makes it a little sing-songy. 
[02:43:30]  It softens.  It's just enough.  We would show them the piece of tape we cut out.  Look, that was the curse right there.  It was.  Leave me alone.  Right.  What a set of teats on her.  It's just the eye.  We beep the eye.  And then everyone becomes a musical note.  We got away with that for many years.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  And then they decided the entire word had to be removed.  But now on TV.  And the context of it and everything revolving around it and everything.  And then sometimes you'll hear like, pop, pop, pop, you know, and you go,  that to me is more offensive than hearing the word.  I don't want to hear duck noises. 
[02:44:00]  So this girl was sucking my cock.  It's like, what is a cock?  I didn't hear what you said.  There was a noise in the middle there.  What did you say?  I said cock.  I'm sorry.  I can't hear you because there's like a beeping noise and I'm not hearing what you're saying.  This girl was sucking my cock.  And I came right in her mouth.  And then I f***ed her in the asshole. 
[02:44:30]  You know, the problem with your daughter, she's a n***er lover.  Oh, she's a n***er lover.  Hey, whoa, no.  Whoa, hey, hey.  Jimmy, what the f*** are you saying?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You're a f***ing potty mouth f***ing.  What am I saying?  No, I'll just say f***.  I'll just say everything.  F***, f***, f***.  I didn't say it.  No.  No, you didn't.  There was a beep in between which makes everything easier.  Makes everything okay.  I knew I'd be hurt over the beep, which could also get my teeth knocked out.  So I edited.  They're nice white teeth.  Yeah, they are shiny. 
[02:45:00]  Your head whitened.  I know.  Listen.  I think Brian's being polite.  Do you have to do that thing at 10?  Yes.  All right.  It's 9.43.  Get the f*** out.  Do you want to do it here or you got to go somewhere else?  Oh, that's what he wants to do.  Do a phone or live with us on the air.  What, what, what happened?  Ruin your career.  What, what?  It's like a half-hour phone conference kind of deal-y.  Ooh.  I got to do.  Show pitch?  Something big?  No, not that, but...  Medical results?  Yeah, right. 
[02:45:30]  Something very important.  Yeah, I got to find out if I'm going to be living another year or not.  You might have me.  He's building a swimming pool, and he's got to talk to the guys.  I want the gunite to be a darker blue.  It's supposed to look like a lake.  It's horrible, like, if you actually got a tape of the phone call, and it's like,  I want two diving boards.  Yeah, we're looking at this, like, maybe you're pitching a movie or a TV.  No, I'm just getting a pool.  Enough.  The waterfall isn't big enough.  I want it grandiose. 
[02:46:00]  Bastards.  I got the help.  You know who I am?  It's a home improvement project.  I'm not going to live like a s***.  I'm going to live like a...  All right.  Yeah, we'll break.  We'll break.  Go into break with Paul R. Nelson, because I got to hear that.  Okay.  That was one of the best, like...  Someone took this simple little sound clip.  We loved the guy.  We loved him. 
[02:46:30]  He lost the election.  His name.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  How could you add spark to that delivery?  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  One of our listeners was able to do it, though.  Before we do it, plugs, Brian.  We got Stanford, Connecticut tonight.  What do we got there?  Ah, we got the sheet.  Stanford Center.  Yeah, the Stanford Center tonight in Stanford, Connecticut.  Tomorrow, the State Theater in New Brunswick.  And Saturday, the Borgata.  And Sunday, somewhere.  Community Theater.  In Morristown, New Jersey.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  You're all over the place. 
[02:47:00]  Thank you, guys.  Very good.  The great Brian Regan.  Thank you very much, man.  You guys are cool.  And he's fun to hang out with after the show, until the sun comes up.  Man, holy Jesus.  We must have had four milkshakes that night.  Could have been maybe more than that.  A couple more than that.  All I know is we left Caroline's.  Uh-huh.  And it was just starting to turn that bluish color out of daylight.  And instead of deciding to just go to our respective hotels and maybe go to sleep,  it was a better idea to go to another bar. 
[02:47:30]  We left, and it was pure daylight out.  That dark blue thing is supposed to be like, that's like an internal warning signal.  Very primal, yeah.  It's like, you know, it's like time to wrap things up, but we just didn't, we didn't do that.  Didn't even do it.  It was shots and, man, were we having fun.  Brian can actually hang out.  He can hang out.  That was the first time I tried it.  But Anthony was telling me, he was saying, have you ever had alcohol? 
[02:48:00]  And I was like, well, I don't know what you're talking about.  What is that called?  This is a new thing, alcohol.  It was, I just had a lot of fun.  Yeah.  Amazing.  Brian, we were talking about the people in the group that kind of peel off during the  night.  And you're the ones that aren't doing that?  It's like one of those fighter jet things where there's seven of them, the blue angels,  and they're all with you.  And then two o'clock, one's like, he's gone.  And then three o'clock, another one peels off.  And then there's only two left.  Two left and a flaming crash at the end of the tank. 
[02:48:30]  Jet fuel and metal.  Everybody else is home safe and sound with their families.  If you're staggering down Broadway.  Too bad he can't stick around.  We made Anthony puke yesterday.  Yep.  Very rare.  That was yesterday when I was very hungover.  Which, by the way, the second time I was drunk, the first time was with you.  Twice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You've got to be careful with that stuff, man.  Watch that.  Brian's out of here.  He's got his conference call.  Hey, guys.  Thank you.  And we've got the Paul R. Nelson, Funk Soul Brother, Megan Mix, as we go to break.  Yep.  Check this out.  Right about now. 
[02:49:00]  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Check it out now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Right about now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Check it out now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Right about now.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.

[02:50:00]  Paul R. Nelson is dead.  Paul R. Nelson, tear down that wall right about now.  Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  I'm Paul R. Nelson. 
[02:50:30]  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Paul R. Nelson has left the building.  There's a virus spreading in our area.  Will it affect you?  Find out on the next Opie and Anthony show.  The virus made my genitals rot off.  I don't really have the virus yet.  I'm kind of itchy and stuff, but I don't really have the virus.  That virus you're always talking about.  El virus, the Opie and Anthony. 
[02:51:00]  You know, today was the day, right?  Today was the day we were supposed to do So Your Pussy's Got Talent.  Oh, ah.  Those motherfuckers.  Those motherfuckers. 
[02:51:30]  And we never heard from Elo.  He called me yesterday.  I used to chat, I guess, but I believe I heard from him on that subject.  I haven't heard from Elo in probably a month.  Really?  Yeah.  I've talked to him a lot in the last few weeks, just sexually.  Phone sex?  Yeah, nothing business.  I'm jerking off.  I always know it's a dirty call when I pick up and I go, hello, and he goes,  all work and no play makes Eric a dull boy.  Well, we were supposed to do So Your Pussy's Got Talent. 
[02:52:00]  It's not happening today.  It fucking blows.  It really pisses me off.  Some stupid listener has to go and die and wreck it for everybody and ruin it.  I'm not even kidding.  That's the reason.  That was the beauty of it.  Another facet of radio.  That's the reason.  So they got lawyers that are scared shitless down in Washington and they're basically saying  no to everything.  Everything.  What's this deal with the Pelosi fucking airplane? 
[02:52:30]  She wants to fly in the same type of airplane that Dick Cheney flies in.  That Dick Cheney flies in?  Yeah, that, what do they call it?  The Lincoln Bedroom in the Sky or something it's called.  You're the fucking, you're the Speaker of the House.  There's a big drop-off between the President and Vice President.  And then the Speaker of the House.  Yeah.  Big drop-off.  There's something wrong with her.  President, Vice President gets like all that shit.  You don't get anything.  Pelosi wants large plane to fly non-stop to California.  That's where she has a house.  So she wants to commute between Washington and, Department of Defense agreed to provide, 
[02:53:00]  speak with military plane in the wake of 9-11.  But she wants like the fancy schmancy, she wants the luxury, like Air Force One type plane.  There's something wrong with this lady.  She's a crazy person.  When is it going to come out?  There's something not right about Nancy Pelosi.  Last Speaker's request for the access to large Air Force plane. 
[02:53:30]  That's, see this, they're all the same.  It's going to come out.  Something is not right in that girl's head.  That lit girl, Jesus.  They're all like that, though.  You know what?  They all make these requests.  It's probably not as, I mean, I don't like her either, but she's probably just said,  I would like to use it for this trip.  And they're making it look, oh no, I think she's making a big stink of it.  They even offered to give her the same size plane that the other Speakers had.  That's it.  Speaker of the House's plane.  It's what you get.  Yeah.  You don't get the Vice President's plane, jackass?  Yeah, you're not the Vice President.  No.  No.  You don't get his plane? 
[02:54:00]  Brod.  It should be done by gender.  What?  You don't get a man's plane?  Right.  Just to fly in a pink one and clean the toilets?  Hey, can some of you guys out there do me a favor?  Do us a favor?  The girl that was going to do So Your Pussy's Got Talent?  Yeah.  She's been hanging out in New York for three days.  Can you believe this?  Fucking blows.  So can you go to shockergirls.tv?  Got that lucrative dot TV.  Shockergirls with a Z dot TV and check it out. 
[02:54:30]  Shockers.  Is she still in New York?  Shockergirls.  Shockergirls with a Z dot TV.  And you can call 888-SHOCK-11.  And get what?  What is it?  I don't know.  Flowers?  The perfect Valentine's Day gift.  The girl fucking herself with a stick.  If you're trying to buy a pussy for Valentine's Day, call 888-SHOCK-11 and mention this fine  program so you can get the savings. 
[02:55:00]  That's right.  And free chocolates.  Who's going to come in?  Which one?  We had a picture of it.  Oh, this is for the DVD?  What's on the DVD?  It's like a slightly racier Girls Gone Wild type...  Slightly racier?  So this girl is obviously a pig.  She would have no problem with us messing with her vagina.  She knew...  So why did Washington have a problem?  She said yes to everything.  And said yes to...  From what I understand, I think she said yes to the whole list we gave her.  And then XM had a problem with it. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, God.  You watch.  This is going to be just like regular radio.  Regular radio in no time.  Fast forward a year to 18 months.  It'll be the same fucking thing.  First, it'll start with like ideology that you talk about.  And then it'll start with language.  Yep.  And then you won't be able to talk.  And then they'll sell a bunch of commercial time.  It won't start with profanity though.  It'll start with hate speech.  They'll say no hate speech.  Exactly.  Hate speech.  That's what I mean.  Like ideology and like that type of shit they won't let you do. 
[02:56:00]  All right.  What?  What?  What?  Look at me for you.  What happened?  Look at the website.  Oh, okay.  They dragged Buzz Aldrin out to talk about Crazy Astronaut Lady.  The hell's he know?  I had to get to the moon and back.  Yeah, what does he know?  I don't know what your reaction was when you first heard this story.  I love Buzz Aldrin.  Well, it was very sad to see such a complicated issue come before NASA as it's struggling right 
[02:56:30]  now with the budget and a transition from finishing up the shuttle flights.  I guess he's on because he's an expert at wearing diapers.  He's worn diapers.  Probably wears different ones now.  But at the same time, embarking on a whole new program.  You know what I like?  You know what I like, Buzz Aldrin?  Some guy came up to him, walked up to him, and said, why don't you admit that the moon  landing was a hoax?  And Buzz Aldrin punched him right in the face. 
[02:57:00]  Just punched him in the face.  You don't mess with Buzz.  And this wasn't that long ago.  Yeah.  I mean, he was an old guy then.  What is he, like mid-70s at this point?  Guy's got to be in his 80s.  Upper 70s?  Really?  I would think.  That's 80?  The guy's in real good shape.  That's pretty impressive.  All right.  Anyway, the E-Rock audio is taking on a life of its own from him getting waxed.  People are requesting the thing we played a little earlier.  Oh, yeah.  No problem.  But we should play this other one as well.  The raw audio is up on opianthony.com. 
[02:57:30]  You take the audio and do something fun with it for us, okay?  You know the deal by now.  And make sure you check out the YouTube video.  We're trying to get that thing to go viral.  It's also up on opianthony.com.  Don't be confused.  There's a long version of E-Rock getting waxed.  The short version is really, really funny because it gets right to the nuts and bolts  of the whole thing.  Nuts.  And then the ending with him falling off the toilet into the wall screaming in pain  is just worth the price of admission.  Of course it is.  Just go to YouTube, throw our names in the old search engine, and you'll find it.  Okay. 
[02:58:00]  So this was the first one that was done by Derek.  Took the Diesel Washington interview and the E-Rock waxing audio.  Diesel, big black porn star.  That just raped guys.  Gay porn star.  In their fuck holes.  Don't forget their throats, Opie.  Grapes that part, too.  The Opie and Anthony Show proudly presents an intimate moment with adult video star Diesel  Washington and our own E-Rock. 
[02:58:30]  You can make this easy, or you can make it hard.  You're going to do everything I say.  If you don't do anything I say, I'm going to smack you across the face.  Start off on your knees first.  Sniff my balls with your nose first.  Then I'll pull out my cock.  Stiff it in the back of your throat.  Smack it across the face a couple of times.  Then bend you over.  Spit into your asshole.  Work two fingers in there.  Open it up in a circular fashion.  Then I'll work my fist in you. 
[02:59:00]  That last scream is the clincher.  Oh, is that great?  Look, we've played it on the radio maybe four or five times now.  We've heard it at least another ten, and it just gets funnier.  Still fucking funny.  It gets funnier.  Fist sound going up the ass.  Thank you, Dan, for PA.  Buzz Aldrin, 77 years young.  77?  All right.  Pushing 80.  All right, so the new one came in today.  I forgot his name.  Terry from Mississippi, I believe, gets the credit for this one. 
[02:59:30]  This is the latest one, and you can do the same if you have some talent.  Sure.  Go to opianthony.com and get the raw audio.  This is Terry from Mississippi.  Came in today.  If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed. 
[03:00:00]  Now, young Skywalker, you will die.  That's really good.  That's really good.  I want to hear E-Rock in Goodfellas.  I want to hear him in the rape scene in Clockwork Orange getting his face slapped.  There's so many great things.  Yeah, this thing is taking on a life of its own, and it started off as a dumb waxing bit 
[03:00:30]  that you've heard many, many times on radio and in the movies and all that crap.  And on TV.  On TV.  E-Rock, what's the latest one we got?  This is from...  A new one.  From Flo.  Ooh.  From Montreal.  All the way from Montreal.  Ooh.  Our neighbors to the north.  Mm-hmm.  As they call those Canucks.  Qu'est-ce que c'est?  Ooh.  This one is...  Speaking Canadian?  This one is Clips of Me.  Up.  As Timmy from South Park. 
[03:01:00]  I don't like it.  Doing a song with Lords of the Underworld.  Right?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  And Timmy's like the lead singer.  Mm-hmm.  Or they're working him into a...  How did that work again?  I don't remember now.  They were practicing in a garage, and he just rolled up past their house, started doing  his retard noises, and they thought he'd be the lead singer for their band.  Right.  Okay.  Classic episode.  There you go.  Let's do it from the top!  What was that? 
[03:01:30]  I don't know, man.  That one's cute.  Yeah.  Cute.  We got some good ones coming in.  Keep them coming.  There you go. 
[03:02:00]  I think a full metal jacket, the soap in...  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that could be a good one, yeah.  In the pillowcase, sure.  Let me see your war face.  Yeah, let me see your war face.  There's plenty.  And, of course, more gay porn, please.  Absolutely.  The more, the better.  The more, the better.  And also with Erox Clips.  25 Most Embarrassing Moments in Black History.  Are we doing our little salute to Black History Month?  We haven't really done it yet.  This is not going to be...  I do it usually, but it's not on the air, and it's before the show in the office. 
[03:02:30]  Well, we could do this, or we could do top cover songs of Black History.  Black History.  Black History.  Black History, yeah.  I say, out of respect for the African American and his sacrifice in this country.  It's Black History Month.  You have to.  When does it start, Jimmy?  If it was February 1st.  Oh.  Right up until the...  29th.  15th.  I don't know how long this month is.  I don't know how long is February.  Is it a leap year?  I hope not.  One extra day of thinking about it. 
[03:03:00]  And what do we say about learning on this show, Jimmy?  It's for queers.  That's right.  It's learning for fruits.  You want to learn?  Put on some fucking...  Why don't you put on a pair of girls' underpants, Mary?  Go learn a little something.  Tweedledled.  That's my new favorite thing.  Learnings for queers.  We're just so obnoxious.  Obnoxious on this show.  Learnings for queers. 
[03:03:30]  All right.  We'll start with this one.  Most embarrassing moments in black history.  Rick James is the king of punk funk.  But he got punked himself by crack.  That crack ain't no good for you.  You ain't got no kind of judgment.  He burned the chicken with the crack pipe.  With the crack pipe.  Yeah, that's a bit much.  That's crossing the line.  Rick was caught.  Not with one, but several women.  It wasn't just one girl.  He'd take out to the spot.  Tie the girls up. 
[03:04:00]  And burning with the crack pipe.  And his girlfriend was down with this as well.  She wanted to leave.  They didn't want her to leave.  Sometimes your friends don't want you to leave the party.  She said she wanted to hit the pipe.  So he was like, bow.  Here you go.  You know what?  Bow.  This is a fucking VH1 type.  Yeah.  And I know why you're pissed off.  Yep.  For the obvious reason.  Yep.  They do 25 Most Embarrassing Moments in Black History.  So they make sure everyone that's talking is black.  Right.  And the stupid music is annoying. 
[03:04:30]  And then you have people that never had a career, a real career, talking about...  Critiquing.  Talking about people that actually did something in entertainment.  You should get some white guys.  I think when that girl, when them students insisted on going to that college.  Yeah.  These aren't really embarrassing moments, I'm thinking, either.  No.  They keep it safe.  They're fun.  You know what?  It'd be great if number one was Rosa Parks.  If they said something really brutal.  We're not doing this.  No. 
[03:05:00]  What was number one?  Do we know it?  So we can just blow it?  Just to see how fucking awful it is?  Yeah.  See how bad it was.  Give us number one.  Let's just see if we can...  That's not right.  That's not right.  It could be Marion Barry.  Yeah.  Smoking crack.  They'll play the fucking sound effects.  Just stop with that VH1.  Your show's on VH1.  Stop.  With the quick in, quick out.  Quick in, quick out.  You know, hey, how are you?  Oh, quick flash commercial.  What the fuck was that shit?  Hey, how'd they do?  I think that.  I know.  Faggot. 
[03:05:30]  There's only some faggot who isn't funny.  We don't need your so-and-so fashion.  And her dress was to die for.  Shut up.  Faggot.  I wouldn't be caught dead wearing a VH1 outfit.  Yes, you would if you continue that lifestyle.  Faggot.  Fucking annoying.  This is Ted Perez of GQ.  And I just don't know what that girl was thinking.  Flash.  Whoa, J-Lo. 
[03:06:00]  Faggot.  It stinks.  They did that with the Golden Globes.  What's his name?  Kaka-Kakachari or whatever the hell his name is.  Kaka-Kaka-Hari.  The fashion expert.  I want to hear a fashion expert talking about the type of gun Kunanan used.  That's what I want to hear a fashion expert talking about.  They're just so dangerous, those people.  They're awful.  It's the same safe shit. 
[03:06:30]  And she wore this to the Grammys.  And we looked at each other.  Remember that?  Yeah.  When J-Lo said, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Little clip.  I don't know.  What is that?  It's just drivel.  Their entire network.  It's FHM type of Maxim Magazine type of drivel.  Hit them quick.  No substance.  Go to something else.  Pop-Up Video was a really good show.  That was conceptually great.  VH1 had some great fucking behind the music.  Some really cool stuff.  Yeah.  And then they just turned into this fucking, this, it's great for the Stairmaster. 
[03:07:00]  That's what everything is.  Just really quick, mindless, unfunny, safe remarks.  I did a few of those.  It was everything edgy they cut.  Every rape, cancer joke.  We did one.  Yeah.  They cut everything, right?  They cut out everything.  And then it was like some dumb thing that I, we don't even remember.  It was a who cares moment in TV history.  That's a, I think that was the show.  Yeah.  Oh, that's really funny.  We made it.  I watch The Insider every night.  That fucking show is one big commercial for the show you're watching.  Coming up.  How the fuck do they pull that off? 
[03:07:30]  It's a half hour commercial for what you're watching.  It's amazing.  Coming up on The Insider.  Dad, stand with the music and the, yeah, flashy graphics.  They never get to anything.  And they don't get to anything.  And when they do, it's two seconds.  And then they're off to promoting their show again.  Well, then, yeah.  Well, it's The Insider, which is a half hour commercial for the show you're watching.  And then that show ends.  And they do the exact same show in the exact same way.  They just call it entertainment tonight.  Yeah.  And they get away with this night after night. 
[03:08:00]  Those shows are god awful.  I can't watch them.  I know I should be up on them for the show because it is popcorn.  That's why I take a peek.  Of course.  Just to see what they're goofing on or whatever.  Well, they're not really goofing.  They played safe.  That's the problem is they're so soft.  The only guy that has any courage with that stuff is that David Spade.  Boy, he tears Tinseltown a new one.  Oh, boy.  Ooh, that guy's edgy.  Oh, boy.  I think he's being sarcastic again.  Tearing Tinseltown a new one.  A new one.  Wait, that's his line.  By one, he means asshole. 
[03:08:30]  But that was the posters on Comedy Central.  Tearing Tinseltown a new one.  A new one.  Ooh.  That guy shreds Tinseltown.  How about Islam?  Shit, dick, fuck.  That's why the internet's so great because, you know, you don't have to answer to anyone  yet.  Eventually, you're going to have to answer to someone on the internet.  Already, some of these sites are starting to go, that's a little too mean.  We're not going to host that video or do this.  But in general, you could just, you know, say whatever the fuck you want and you don't 
[03:09:00]  have to answer to nobody.  You know what kind of celebrity gossip stuff is funny?  If someone created like a Nicole Brown Simpson Pez dispenser and you just fucking, you  know, you push the nose and it goes, wah, wah, and tears come out of it and fucking  Pez comes out of the neck and you all laugh and have a candy.  I don't know what that means.  Let's go to Steve in Canada.  Steve.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  Evening.  I just want to comment on that MTV stuff.  Like, you turn it to the MTV channel.  There's no music. 
[03:09:30]  What happened to the fucking music?  What's with MTV and the music?  Why call it music television if you're not playing any more music?  It's not fucking TV.  It is TV, sir.  It's not music, but it is TV.  There's not many people really that want to sit and watch music videos anymore is what  it is.  A few of them, but they're a much younger demo and not the demo they're shooting for anymore.  That's not even true anymore because they're cancelling TRL.  Are they?  Are they really?  Yeah. 
[03:10:00]  Does this window open?  I have to jump out.  I have to jump out a window.  They are cancelling TRL.  And that was a show with music videos that they only played like a just a snippet of  the video.  And that wasn't even good enough.  Music videos are a thing of the past.  We've lived through the era of the music video.  It really is kind of a thing of the past.  Made bands years ago.  Yeah, absolutely.  Now it's going to be about online.  Take your video, put it online. 
[03:10:30]  The only videos you want, like on New Year's Eve, maybe you want to stay home and watch  Mexican radio.  I mean, everybody's face comes up to the beans.  You know, radio.  Radio.  All right.  MTV is brilliant though.  You got to give them credit.  As much as a PC shit annoys me, they changed the way television was shot with the camera  work.  MTV fucking, the real world was like one of the first reality shows.  Yeah.  They changed the way TV works.  The real world now just fucking stinks.  Yeah.  I don't even, like originally it was. 
[03:11:00]  They took normal people from a city, threw them in a house and they interacted together  and that was fine.  And they drank every once in a while.  Now it's all about just getting them completely drunk and showing them in bars.  And putting them in, oh, they get back and let's get them in bikinis and in the hot tub  and let's get these hot fucking auditioned girls into the hot tub to make out and, which  is all well and fine, but it's not a reality show.  Call it what it is.  It's a scripted fucking Girls Gone Wild show or something. 
[03:11:30]  No reality there.  It's like an episode of the fucking OC.  I hate that show.  I've never watched it, but I assume it sucks.  Oliver.  The OC.  Just from the commercials.  On the next OC.  Is it Orange County?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the guy in it is supposed to be in high school and he's like 35 years old.  Is that the student?  I'm going to the powder dance this Saturday.  Yeah.  I'm going to the dance.  I'm going to the dance.  I got to shave again today.  Oliver St. Louis.  What's up? 
[03:12:00]  What's up?  Oh, St. Louis.  Hi.  What up?  What up?  Yeah, I got an idea for Pest Radio, man.  All right.  Pitch a show.  It's called the Ramone Show or maybe the Ramone Hour.  It's where people send in the Ramone phone calls and we Ramone people live on the air.  Sir, as the creator of, not of Ramone, but of the Ramone phone issue, I will say that's  a funny thing for a few minutes.  It's a nice aside to have or perhaps a feature on a show, but I don't believe it's a strong 
[03:12:30]  enough or interesting enough topic to sustain a show.  So I would have to even say that a couple of moments of that are great, but anything  in moderation is great.  You've just been, if you were a chef, you just introduced the parsley dinner.  Yes.  That's what you've done, my friend.  It's like salad without a dressing, maybe?  No, worse than that.  Absolutely.  You could make a meal out of a salad.  You certainly can.  What you've given us is shit.  That's right.  It's shit without a dick? 
[03:13:00]  What are you doing?  What is he doing in the background?  What are you doing in the background, Oliver?  Getting high, brother.  All right.  Okay.  Nothing wrong with that.  Goodbye, Ollie.  Nothing wrong with the weed.  Bye, Ollie.  God bless.  God bless, Ollie.  All right.  Oliver.  Well, speaking of music, the top cover songs of all time.  Cover songs.  Okay.  Now, what is your favorite cover song of all time?  I'm confused.  Confused.  I don't know what this means.  What's your favorite cover song?  Is it the song itself that has been covered, or is it the cover version of the song? 
[03:13:30]  Oh, boy.  I'm confused.  All right.  The cover version of the original song.  The cover version of the original song.  Yes.  So the original song might suck.  Right.  The cover version's good.  Right.  So you pick that.  Well, what's interesting about this list, there's a bunch of songs on here I never knew were made  famous by someone covering that tune.  Ah.  Oh, some surprises in there.  I would say so.  Oh.  I would say so.  What's your favorite cover song of all time? 
[03:14:00]  That's the question today.  I would say, let me give you a couple I like.  I love, believe it or not, and then she kissed me, Kissed It, in the 70s, which is a great cover.  Of course it's Kissed.  No, no, no, that's a great one.  If it wasn't odd.  Did Black Sabbath do any covers?  Evil Woman, but that doesn't count.  Favorite one, probably Hurt by Johnny Cash.  I'd have to say.  That is one of the most amazing cover songs ever.  Although his version of Cats in the Cradle is great, too.  I don't know if it's in there, but it's probably not.  Hurt made the list by Johnny Cash. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, he did.  You know, Nine Inch Nails did originally, of course.  12th place.  I'm trying to think of a cover song.  I love...  All I can think of is Tesla's signs.  Ew.  Well, there's like the obvious ones.  I Shot the Sheriff, I clapped it.  Marley did that originally.  Marley's version is so much better, though.  Hard Handled by the Black Crows, Otis Redding did that originally.  Did he?  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  Trying to find some more.  Live and Let Die, Guns and Roses.  Of course, Paul McCartney did that originally. 
[03:15:00]  I Will Always Love You.  It's originally a Dolly Parton song.  Don't be original.  Knockin' on Heaven's Door, another Guns and Roses song, but it's originally, of course,  a Dylan song.  Higher Ground.  There you go, Ann.  Higher Ground.  Ah, there you go.  Stevie Wonder did it originally, but Red Hot Chili Peppers did a fine version.  So what's your favorite cover song of all time?  Oh.  Oh.  Um.  Oh, why am I put on the spot like this?  I don't have one.  I don't know. 
[03:15:30]  Cover.  Let me think.  Nirvana did a great one, too.  Cobain did a great Lead Belly cover.  I like that one a lot, too.  Fucking In the Pines.  In the Pines is an amazing song.  Oh, that's a cover.  It's a great one.  Yeah, it absolutely is.  I like Lead Belly.  It's a good one.  Yeah.  The Nirvana song that made the list, though, is Lake of Fire, originally done by the Meat  Puppets.  Oh, fuck yeah.  That's a good tune, man.  I forgot about that one.  That came in, like, 22nd place.  For example, Black Magic Woman by Santana.  Did you know that that's...  A cover?  Yeah.  Did you know that?  No.  Who did it?  Fleetwood Mac?  No way. 
[03:16:00]  Fleetwood Mac originally did Black Magic Woman back in 68.  68?  Do we have that?  Santana made it a huge hit in 70.  This is Fleetwood Mac's version?  Two years later, they covered it?  Assholes.  Fuckers.  I hate Fleetwood Mac, and I hate Santana.  This is Fleetwood Mac.  I had no clue.  Yes, I got a black magic woman.  Got me so blind, I can't see.  But she's a black magic woman, and she's trying to make a devil out of me. 
[03:16:30]  Don't turn your back on me, baby.  Don't turn your back on me, baby.  At least he doesn't have a 20-minute fucking Santana guitar solo in the middle of it.  Right.  Enough Santana.  Most overrated guitarist in rock and roll is Carlos Santana. 
[03:17:00]  You're insane.  Most overrated guitarist.  Why?  Listen to his leads.  20 times ago.  That was the sound back then in the 70s.  It stinks.  Clapton also overrated.  And they went on and on.  Clapton, much better than fucking Santana.  But, oh, I hate Santana.  Anytime a Santana song comes on, I cannot get to that button.  What's the problem with Santana?  Songs are too long. 
[03:17:30]  I just don't like it.  I don't like that they're Hispanic.  Anthony.  I'm kidding.  See, I got you for a minute.  You're looking at me like, really?  Like, that's a hell of a reason.  All right.  Never thought of that one before.  Except that, sir.  Sir.  No, it's, I just don't like his, the songs are much too long because of his self-indulgent  crap leads.  Yeah.  All right.  The kinks had some bad leads in there, too.  Do they?  I swear, sometimes, I don't even know which kink did the leads in there.  Because it sounded, there are kink songs where the leads sound like the guy's fingers 
[03:18:00]  are stuck in the strings and he's trying to rip them out.  Awful guitar leads.  He might have thick fingers.  Well, then don't play a kink guitar.  It's got a problem.  Here's another one that's on the list.  Did you know that Baby, I'm Gonna Leave You by Zeppelin is a cover.  Fleetwood Mac?  No.  No?  Who did that?  Joan Baez?  Joan Baez?  Joan, I hate her, too.  Please tell me.  Do we have this?  Please tell me.  Yeah, I think this is it right here. 
[03:18:30]  All right.  Joan Baez from 1962.  It's not going to be.  Don't get excited.  Before Zeppelin made this a huge song.  What year?  1962.  62.  I might have the Zeppelin version.  Yeah, this would be the Zeppelin version.  Wow, that Joan Baez can play.  Yeah.  Wow, Joan Baez is really.  This is terrific.  I'll say what I love is.  Jesus fucking Christ.  Me and Bobby McGee by Janis Joplin is a great cover.  That was Chris Christopherson's song.  Chris Christopherson.  Are you kidding? 
[03:19:00]  No, it's his song.  Bill, if you don't find that one, then we give up on this bit.  That's right, Bill.  Busted flat and batting roots.  Oh, yeah.  Weird here.  Getting for the train.  Stinks on ice.  Feeling lily fears.  I'd rather see Janis Joplin in the Blade movies.  Bobby thummed a diesel down just before it rained.  Took us all away. 
[03:19:30]  Jeez, this must.  How long is this fucking song of him doing this dirge?  This came in eighth place, by the way.  Top cover tunes.  Janis is fucking.  How long is this song?  Unbelievable.  We still got 3.30 left.  3.30 left.  Fuck that.  Because it's kind of a long song.  Yeah, he probably doesn't do it at the end, which he does.  Na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  That's why Janis Joplin doesn't.  We finally sang or failed a song that drives. 
[03:20:00]  More a writer than a singer.  Yeah.  Chris.  Yeah.  Freedom's just another word.  We have the freedom to turn this off, too, don't we?  How about this one?  Another surprise.  Did you know that Take Me to the River by the Talking Heads, 1978, is a cover?  Really?  I love that song.  Does that seem like a cookie?  Give the original here for Jimmy.  You've heard this, right?  I don't know.  I mean, I may have.  Talking Heads are very eclectic. 
[03:20:30]  Back in the day, as they call it.  You're weirdos in school would listen to Talking Heads.  Like, you're a weirdo. 
[03:21:00]  You know this?  You've never heard this before, Jimmy?  I kind of like the Talking Heads song.  Yeah, they're all right.  And this song, I bet.  They do Psycho Killer, right?  Yeah.  That one.  That one.  I haven't seen you.  And then this one.  You know this part?  Right to the chorus.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  Any minute now. 
[03:21:30]  Up, up, up, up.  It's here.  Here.  You've never heard this.  I know.  I swear to God.  That is so weird.  That is so weird to me.  Yeah.  All right.  The original was done by Al Green.  Al Green?  Believe it or not.  Yeah.  Do we have Al Green's version?  We do?  I'm going to guess one, too.  All right.  Fuck it. 
[03:22:00]  I don't think I've ever heard this before in my life.  Yeah, yeah.  1974.  Come on.  I'm going to get this song.  Bring it.  A little Junior Park.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A cousin, man.  It's going on.  The people act up.  Rosalto play for you now.  Here you go.  The hell is it?  I don't know why I love you like I do.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  The changes that you put me through.  Used all my money in my cigarette. 
[03:22:30]  And I haven't seen how to have you yet.  I don't know.  Don't you tell me.  It's a cool version.  Better.  You know what?  I think the talking heads ruined this song.  I reckon the original is all right.  There you go. 
[03:23:00]  Good horn section.  We've got a know-it-all out there.  All right.  Know-it-all.  He's got knowledge.  That means he's a queer.  What is fucking Pantyway saying?  Dan from South Jersey.  Joan Baez didn't write, babe, I'm going to leave you.  It was a traditional folk song that was from the early 1900s.  No one can actually pinpoint who wrote it.  But I guess she was the first person.  Wait.  It's not saying that it's who wrote it.  Hey.  Tell this dickhead. 
[03:23:30]  Is it about who wrote it?  No.  It's the cover.  It's covers.  He's one of those learners.  You queer.  Proud.  Proud Mary by credence.  Can we make the word queer popular again because of Jim Norton?  For learners.  Because I read that yesterday.  I think it was on Wackbag.  Someone has that as one of their quotes.  It says learning is for queers.  Queers.  Like we've got to bring that word back.  That should be a billboard.  Can we get that on TV?  Yeah.  Get that on TV someday. 
[03:24:00]  All right.  I'm going to say Proud Mary by Ike and Tina Turner.  The original was Credence.  I'm going to say that the version done by Ike and Tina would be a great cover.  I had another one too in my head.  I fucking asked.  Yeah.  Jimmy, that didn't make the list.  A shit like this that I just cannot even think about.  I'm sorry.  I can't come up with one.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  And then when it's said, I'm like, oh, yeah.  We did I Shot the Sheriff.  Jimi Hendrix, Hey Joe, was originally done by Billy Roberts.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Do we have that? 
[03:24:30]  Just a taste?  From 1962?  Probably the original.  Most of the Hendrix popular songs were done by somebody else.  Purple Haze too?  I don't know if Purple Haze, but All Along the Watchtower was, I think, a Dylan song, right?  Are they interviewed?  They went from Buzz Aldrin to Dr. Drew Pinsky about this astronaut fucking love scandal.  Is that Dr. Drew from the...  Yeah.  Yeah.  They are running the gamut of fucking people to yap about this stupid astronaut bitch.  Holy... 
[03:25:00]  Who fucking does his hair?  Teflon?  Jesus.  Good improv.  It's funny.  It did look like Teflon.  We don't have that?  Bill's panicking.  He should be.  All right.  Hard to handle.  We did.  Twist and Shout by the Beatles.  I got one.  Isley Brothers did that originally in 62?  Yeah.  I want to say Elvis' version of My Way, which is a remake of a Sinatra song.  Well.  It should be up there if it's not on there.  Yeah.  It's great.  Is it?  I like it better than this.  I hate Sinatra song.  Jimmy?  My Way is up there. 
[03:25:30]  Okay.  You go into Frank's place and you fucking say that.  I don't know where Frank's place is.  I'm not that serious.  It's in the closet right down the street.  Oh.  Down the hallway there.  Down the street.  I wish it was.  My Way is on the list.  It's number five.  Top cover songs of all time.  Okay.  This version of My Way, though.  All right. 
[03:26:00]  Is this the Sex Pistols?  Sid Vicious.  Closing credits music to a lot of 80s movies, right?  And to the movie.  Yes, and Nancy.  Goodfellas.  Goodfellas.  Goodfellas, right.  That's better than Elvis' version?  What are they talking about?  And the song was originally written by?  By Apollinka.  And Sinatra did it.  But the thing is, Elvis' version, he was so doped out when he intros it. 
[03:26:30]  I don't know if we have the clip.  I love it.  He goes, we're going to do a number now, originally recorded by Frank Sinatra.  It's called, and you can hear one of his band members go, My Way.  And he goes, My Way.  My Way.  I don't know the lyrics, so I'm going to have to read it, if you don't mind.  And he belts out My Way.  It might be his last performance.  Right.  He belts out My Way, fat, doped out of his mind, reading it.  Bloated, just, yeah.  Do we have that?  It's Elvis live.  It's a drug-induced bloat.  It's so cool, though, because he doesn't know the name of the song.  It's called, and he's called My Way. 
[03:27:00]  It's called My Way.  It was recorded by Frank Sinatra.  And he's called My Way.  My Way.  My Way.  My Way.  My Way.  I don't know the words to it, so I'll have to read it, if you don't mind.  From an arena full of people.  Right.  I might eat the lyrics.  I kind of do mind.  And I paid $200 for the scene.  The end is near.  And so I faced the final toilet. 
[03:27:30]  My friend.  Learnings for queers.  I stayed my case.  You know one of the coolest things fucking Elvis ever did is, after this, the next song  he closed with his, uh, Can't Help Falling In Love With You, is like his updated version.  Yeah.  And when he says goodbye to the people, instead of adios, he says adios.  Adios.  Fucking coolest thing I've ever heard a guy say.  How the Mexicans say it.  Adios.  Adios.  I did it my way. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, I regret.  Regrets.  I've had a few.  But then again, too few to mention.  He's reading this, huh?  I've seen him do it.  He's holding a paper.  I mean, he knew it already, but he just couldn't remember on stage.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Saw it through.  Couldn't remember on stage.  He should.  Without one exception.  It's the drugs.  I plan.  Each charted course. 
[03:28:30]  Nice.  Each careful step.  Along the byway.  Along the byway.  Oh, and more.  Much more than it.  Stupid dice got me in the Elvis.  Now I love him.  I did it.  Yeah.  I see that.  Byway.  Byway.  Byway.  Byway.  Day experiences.  I've had a few.  You.  That again, I don't want to mention.  Ready for the next cover song? 
[03:29:00]  I've traveled each and every bisexual way.  Here's the next great cover that made the list.  Okay.  Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.  Who originally did this?  Oh, he was a cover song.  What was his name?  Who did it?  Uh, Bobby McFarlane.  Oh, right.  Bobby McFarlane.  That was covered by the ass. 
[03:29:30]  Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.  I like this version better.  Much better.  Done by a lemon each.  Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.  That's terrible. I'm sorry. 
[03:30:00]  By the way, it's official. Drew Boogie is brilliant.  Yeah, that's amazing.  That's a Drew Boogie original.  When is he going to start making money off this crap?  That's my ringtone, and about five or six people want it already.  Five or six?  Stop it.  I've only had it for a day, but people in my stupid world...  Guys, he knows what he means.  Yeah.  People that are here in the ring are like, where the fuck did you get that? 
[03:30:30]  We actually tried doing...  Drew and I did a ringtone thing for about six months,  made a grand total of, I think, $70 for him.  Wow.  The markup on ringtones sucks.  The markup on ringtones sucks.  How much percentage did you give him?  You probably ripped him off.  No, I didn't.  It wasn't me at all.  We took that meeting.  Dude, you guys can make a fortune.  You've got to get into ringtones.  See, that right there is the perfect ringtone.  Right.  That's the perfect idea for a ringtone.  It's catchy.  It's fast.  You don't have to hear a lot of it to get it. 
[03:31:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So, some ringtones, you know, in order to even get it, you'd have to hear...  Like, people wanted some of our bits or something for ringtones.  What, are you going to sit there while your call goes to fucking message  because you've got to sit through a 20-minute fucking bit ringtone?  But that's perfect.  Metallica ones are funny, though.  Oh, well, that's kind of them doing the...  Even that, at least it's short.  It's like you can't have these long fucking ringtones.  Yeah.  And the phone companies.  I have Kitty Pwn on my computer.  I have Kitty Pwn on my computer. 
[03:31:30]  That's a good ringtone.  People love that one, too.  But you have to sell so many of them to make any kind of decent mark.  Yeah.  Because the phone companies, the way they have it set up,  they take 50% right off the top, if not more.  So, you've got a ringtone section on your site where listeners can just take them?  If you search on ringtones, you'll see them.  No, where they can just take them for free.  Yeah.  Well, we do put audio up.  And if you know how to get an MP3 in your phone, yeah.  Good point.  You know who's selling and buying ringtones.  Oh.  Enough said.  The Japs.  It's not.  No.  It's their month. 
[03:32:00]  No.  Yeah.  No.  It's a lot of hip-hop.  A lot of that.  Look at all the commercials at night.  Oh, yeah.  For the ringtones.  Just dial 8002 and text it to whack effing ringtone shit and shit.  I'd be style on you.  And then you realize at the bottom it says like 850 per second that you're on the line.  And 850 every time your phone rings.  Got a black history moment.  Oh, okay.  Boss, you got to speak to somebody just to speak to me.  Listen, dog.  You can't eat with me. 
[03:32:30]  And if, listen, I advise you don't really want to beef with me.  Please.  Oh, you mad because I'm styling on you.  You got to have better get and get styling on me.  Listen.  Plus the cow is on me.  So act up and you will fucking have to lay down.  What was that?  That was a great, great clip.  One of the greatest punches you'll ever see in your life.  Two guys are having a little rap, you know, kind of a contest.  Battle.  Battle.  Rap battle.  I don't know the Negro lingo as far as that goes. 
[03:33:00]  But I'm having a rap battle.  A rap off.  A rap off.  And one guy was just tearing up the other guy.  And you could hear him.  He's just like, no, listen, listen.  You're just mad because I'm styling on you.  Like he degraded the guy.  And the guy answered it with just punching him in the face.  He got so pissed that he was losing so badly that he punched him in the face.  And it's on video.  Really funny.  Yeah.  And the new video that's out is adorable. 
[03:33:30]  What?  Have you seen it?  No.  What?  It's a little black kitten.  And he's up on his hind legs.  And he's using his two front paws and kind of like thrusting them towards this orange cat.  Big orange cat.  And they're playing that in the background.  And it's like the little black kitten's going, I'm just styling.  You're mad because I'm styling on you.  That's correct.  And right when the fight starts, the orange cat lunges at him.  Look at this little kitten.  He's adorable. 
[03:34:00]  Oh, so they dubbed the audio we just heard over this video?  Over this.  All right, gotcha.  And then the orange cat has just had enough.  Just put in styling on you.  They dubbed it perfect, too.  In the YouTube search.  That's where the fight kicks in.  Oh, that's hilarious.  How cute are little kittens frolicking?  Did you see?  Steve will probably like link that.  Did you see the guy yelling at his cats?  No.  Oh, I didn't want to laugh at it.  He's not hurting the cats.  He's just screaming at them.  Oh, my God.  But he's walking around his house just screaming at his fucking cat. 
[03:34:30]  Get the fuck down!  Oh, I got to see it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, good.  Link that one, too.  It really is funny.  Yeah, I've got it.  And it gets funny as you're watching it.  You're like, oh, this guy's great.  Is it on YouTube?  I got to check it out right away.  He's not hitting the...  I like animals.  What are you throwing the search for that one?  Do you remember?  Scream at cats, I think.  Yeah, it's...  Or cat yell, yell a cat.  Cat yell or something on a house.  Watch him.  We'll find it.  Hey.  Oh.  And Steve will link it on opianthony.com.  All right, back to the cover songs.  Lake of Fire, we did that.  Up on the roof. 
[03:35:00]  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  How about Rolling Stones?  Oh, the Stones probably did a lot of covers, sure.  Time is on my side.  I thought that was a Rolling Stones original.  It's not.  Wow.  Who did that?  It was a...  Winding.  And we have to have that available on the line, right?  This poor bastard performed a song in 1963.  The Stones did it in 1964.  Oh, and just stole his lack of thunder.  Stole his lack of thunder.  Time wasn't on his side. 
[03:35:30]  We don't have that one?  Time is on your side.  Not the original.  One year.  What's wrong with XM?  I don't know.  It's your company.  It's your company, Opie.  Where'd it go?  Well, now that you've announced it, Opie has bought XM Satellite.  XM Satellite Radio.  It's called OM.  Bill just announced it.  OM.  Well, I say fuck them in their fuckholes.  Right away.  Wow.  That's the new motto.  Wow stickers out.  Fuck them in their fuckhole stickers.  Why wouldn't they have this stuff?  They brag about having a million songs in the computer.  We got it with Ronnie Bowman and Ira Thomas, but not in... 
[03:36:00]  Ira.  Oh.  Ira.  I'm is on my side with a deposition, of course.  Yes, it is.  All right, we'll run down the top ten and get out of this bit.  It's...  Rainbow Connection is in tenth place.  What's that?  Well, you remember that dumb song by Kermit the Frog?  The Frog.  Oh, no.  And they say that Willie Nelson, this is the tenth best cover song of all time.  Have you heard the Willie Nelson song of Rainbow Connection?  No.  It's from 2001. 
[03:36:30]  Yuck.  How hack of him to cover this.  No kidding.  But he smokes a lot of pot.  Why are there so many songs about rainbows?  And what's on the other side?  I want to choke him with his ponytail.  Well...  Rainbows are visions, but only illusions.  Right.  And rainbows have nothing to hide. 
[03:37:00]  It's like something he'd do just hanging out at his house as a goof.  So we have been told.  Yeah.  All stones.  And some choose to believe it.  They released this.  Let's see if they buy it.  I know they're not waiting on the scene.  All right.  I'm light already.  We get it.  Stupid rainbows.  Yeah.  Learnings for...  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, Bill.  Earl said that the Ira Thomas version is the original version of Time Is On My Side.  Earl said...  Really? 
[03:37:30]  Whatever Earl says goes.  How the fuck would he know?  Earl knows everything about music.  Yes.  And life.  And nothing about anything else.  I adore Earl.  There'll be no bad talking Earl on this show ever.  Let's hear the original version of Time Is On My Side.  Time Is On My Side.  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.  Time Is On My Side. 
[03:38:00]  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.  Now, you always say that you want to be free.  Oh, God.  Like I hoped you would, baby.  Oh, God.  I don't have to try no more.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Time Is On My Side.  Wow. 
[03:38:30]  She's kicking that out.  Or is it a he?  What is that?  Back then you couldn't tell.  Hello, Negro.  Happy History Month there.  Thank you.  Why don't you sit, Earl?  Earl's been just a treasure trove on the Ron and Fez show during Black History Month.  He is, I listened to your Black History Month moments.  Yes.  That are on.  They have one every day.  And Earl talks about black people and what they've done to contribute to our society during this month. 
[03:39:00]  And what's the date?  It's the eighth?  What is it?  The eighth?  Yes.  He's already run out of people.  Have you?  He's down to, I swear to you, I heard him paying tribute to none other than Freddie Boom Boom Washington from Welcome Back, Cotter.  Please tell me.  The actor.  Sorry.  I just wanted to jump in.  Please tell me the bid is that they're going to force you to have one every day to the end of the month.  Bid?  That's what it is.  But you have to go to the end every day? 
[03:39:30]  Oh.  Every day.  And of course it started out nicely.  Who did you start with?  Rudy Ray Moore.  Rudy Ray Moore.  Wow.  Not Rudy.  Yeah?  Dolomite himself.  You skipped Malcolm X and went right to fucking Lawrence Hill and Jacobs.  How did that go?  Yeah.  He doesn't want to, you know, he doesn't want to take the obvious route.  Okay.  Good for him.  You know, obviously everybody's going to say Martin Luther King, Malcolm X.  Rabble Rouser.  The Peanut Guy, George Washington Carver.  Myth.  You didn't do anything.  And then I just have to go back to Martin Luther King.  Yeah.  I have no idea. 
[03:40:00]  Yeah.  Jackie Robinson.  Ah, there you go.  Jackie Robinson.  By the way.  We're doing our own thing with Earl at 11 o'clock today.  Yeah.  We replay the time Black Girl Quit Our Show.  So we're doing our own tribute during this Black History Month of Earl.  It's old school Earl.  It's terrific.  I've listened to the clip of you and the picture controversy from N.E.W.  It is hysterical.  Very funny.  And Earl is also, if you didn't know, growing his hair in to a big afro.  How much longer are you going to grow it? 
[03:40:30]  End of March.  End of March.  So this is the most hair I've ever seen Earl growing in.  Big afro with a baseball field.  Well, he's a little fertilizer up top.  I think the groundskeeper's been negligent.  Oh my God.  He's a little touch of the gray there.  But I think once it fills in, you'll have a pretty good fro going.  Can we see the top, Earl?  Well, Jesus.  Just a little.  No, no, but you're saying that it's not as full as it used to be. 
[03:41:00]  From the top, he looks like fucking Ozzie Davis in Jungle Fever.  It looks like they're starting to gather for the March on Washington.  Oh, shit.  They're starting to gather.  It looks like some of the crowd is gathering on a mud field.  Right.  Well, they're staying out of the mud.  No one wants to get into the middle. 
[03:41:30]  Just in case there's some violence.  Silence the violence.  Increase the peace, I say.  Wow.  All right.  That's what I say.  Do you know this bit?  Do you know any of these songs?  The top cover songs?  Yeah, some of them.  I don't want to ask you.  What do you think is a great top cover song?  Great cover song.  I mean, obvious stuff like Hendrix and the...  Did he write any of his hits, Earl?  Well, he wrote Purple Haze and...  He wrote Purple Haze.  He didn't write All Along.  He didn't write... 
[03:42:00]  Hey Joe.  Hey Joe.  He didn't write...  What's that?  All Along.  Oh, he wrote Voodoo Child.  Voodoo Child he wrote.  What else?  When Cries Mary.  He wrote that?  Yeah.  What's a great cover song?  We're trying to figure out the top ten of all time.  I hate this...  Wow.  I mean, you guys have played something like...  I like the Talking Heads version of...  I never heard that song before.  Take Me to the River?  Al Green?  Al Green's is better.  Al Green.  Al Green's is better.  I like that version.  You know, Elvis Hound Dog is really good over to Big Mama Thornton, even though I love 
[03:42:30]  Big Mama Thornton.  Oh, I didn't know Elvis' song?  No.  Elvis ripped off the black man.  Oh, I didn't know that.  He might as well have just taken a gun and shoved it in black people's faces and just  stole from them.  Because that's what Elvis did.  Didn't he credit black people too, though?  What happened was music and radio in general, they acknowledged that the black people had some  great songs, but they just couldn't sell it.  So they invented people like Elvis and stuff.  Right, Earl?  No, it was a completely segregated country.  What?  Yeah.  It was called race music, called the good old days.  It was called race music, because they were singing about sex and drugs. 
[03:43:00]  You people were all...  We were bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.  Yeah.  And you guys were singing about drugs and fucking and shit.  And then it scared whitey.  Earl will tell you, where does the term rock and roll come from?  That's what it means.  And don't say Alan Freed.  He was the one that used it on the radio.  But where did the term actually come from?  Oh, it used to meet...  It was a euphemism for sex.  For sex?  That's right.  Yeah.  Rockin' and rollin', rockin' roll.  That's right.  Rockin' and rollin' all night long.  And Alan Freed used to like some of that race music, start playing it and calling it rock 
[03:43:30]  and roll.  White people really do stink.  You're right.  We were doing Bob, Bob, Bob, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang,  Earth Angel.  And they're like...  It ain't nothing but a hound dog!  Yeah.  Singing about real pain and agony.  Oh, yeah.  Sweaty fucking.  Singing about stretching out pussy and shit like that.  What?  Yeah.  A house dress raised up.  Fucking banged down on her head.  Good stupid whitey.  Teen Angel.  Yeah, Teen Angel. 
[03:44:00]  They're singing about sweaty asses.  What's that song of?  Oh, yeah.  Like, listen to the lyrics throughout that song, 60 Minute Man.  Yeah.  That's pretty obvious what it's about.  What is it about, Earl?  60 Minutes.  Andy Rooney.  Yeah.  No.  You never notice.  Yeah, we notice.  You never notice black people when they're singing about fucking.  That's what it was all about.  You never notice that no one has noticed that I'm useless?  You ever notice I'm hunched over like I'm trying to suck my own cock when I walk these 
[03:44:30]  days?  I saw it at a party.  Oh, poor guy.  All right.  Enough with this dumb letter L.  I want to hear what the top five are.  All right.  Well, Midnight Train to Georgia.  Gladys Knight and the Pips.  That isn't from Gladys Knight and the Pips?  Who did that?  Ted Burberry.  And the Pips.  Sissy Houston, as in Whitney's great-great-aunt?  Aunt?  Or cousin?  Was it?  Midnight Train to Georgia?  But without the Pips going, woo, woo, it just don't feel right. 
[03:45:00]  Is Grapevine on there?  Heard it through the Grapevine?  Fuck yeah.  That's a Creepy song.  Yeah, it's on there.  What's that Marvin Gaye song?  It didn't make the top ten, though.  There's a couple of...  Gladys Knight did a version of it.  Me and Bobby McGee in eighth place by Janis Joplin, Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young Woodstock.  Of course, that was originally done by Joni Mitchell, yes.  Joni Mitchell and Joan Baez I put in the same category.  Hippie.  Yeah.  Hippie, just garbage.  Jesus category.  Joan Baez gets up on stage and talks about her husband is still on a hunger strike in prison.  It's like, who gives a shit that fucking troublemaker? 
[03:45:30]  Some anti-government hippie bullshit they were into.  Yeah.  Trying to stop our war.  Six more.  Me and Ronnie locked in that fucking cage.  And her and Jane Fonda mouthing off with the gooks when me and Ronnie are looking at each other,  trying to figure out how to get out of those cages in the Nam.  Right, Earl?  Yes.  Thanks for fighting our wars, by the way. 
[03:46:00]  That's what I say on this...  Which one?  ...wars.  All of them.  One time Ronnie shot a gook right in the head.  Yeah?  During a little game that they were playing.  What the hell is that?  Russian roulette.  Russian roulette.  And then he got down and got me out of a cage full of rats.  I was losing it at that point.  I was screaming, almost drowning.  Rats would get me and he pulled me out of there.  Got me on a helicopter.  I'm not looking for an answer.  No, okay.  I barely talk about this stuff ever. 
[03:46:30]  Really, uh, it's hard to talk about.  Get our place on.  Go ahead.  Get the fuck down!  Fucking jump!  Jump!  Oh.  Get the fuck down from there!  That's...  Fucking jump!  Jump!  Do it, you bitch!  Do it!  He's yelling at his cat.  Jump!  Jump!  Do it!  You fucking pussy! 
[03:47:00]  What's the cat doing?  Just staring at her.  Jump!  But he yells at his different cats.  Just...  The cat's terrified?  Well, yeah, the cat's probably used to him.  Oh, no.  But he's got a few different cats.  Look at me.  Look at me.  Up here.  Up here.  What the fuck are you looking at?  Don't fucking run away from me!  Oh, my God.  I'll end you! 
[03:47:30]  Where'd you fucking go?  You son of a bitch!  Where'd you fucking go?  Fuck!  Don't fucking go in my closet!  My favorite one.  The cat runs back out of the closet.  Oh, that's horrible.  You are a fucking piece of shit!  I'm going to rape you!  Fuck you!  Holy shit!  Run! 
[03:48:00]  Fucking run!  Yeah!  Oh, this guy's a lunatic.  It's really funny.  Don't fucking stare at me!  You fucking bitch!  Holy shit!  Oh, what's wrong with this guy?  I love when the cat runs into the closet.  He's going to run into my fucking closet and the cat runs out.  Cat yelling is officially up on opianthony.com. 
[03:48:30]  Oh, that's horrible.  There it is.  Poor cat.  Cat doesn't know what to do.  He's being yelled at.  He's scolded.  Where's E-Rock?  Is it too late?  They run away.  Where did you fucking go?  Don't stop fucking staring at me.  Is it too late?  Oh, God.  That's great.  Is it too late?  Too late?  You want us out at a certain time to play the black girl a bit?  Oh, we're cutting it close.  What happened?  We can do it now. 
[03:49:00]  What about line of the day?  Was it good?  They're always good.  All right.  Good answer.  Ah, screw this list.  What's number one?  I don't remember.  All right, me neither.  Greg.  What?  Greg.  No, don't waste time.  How about the...  Greg.  Greg.  Greg?  I'm not with the list.  Stupid list.  That was a fucking cover?  Give me that.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  That's so funny.  The cat went in the closet.  Yeah, and then just runs back out. 
[03:49:30]  He's got to tell us that.  All along the watchtower.  No cliffhangers today by Hendrix.  Originally done by Bob Dylan.  Number one cover of all time.  No lines of the day today?  Hotel California.  Okay.  Three?  Wow.  What's going to happen, Iraq?  Tell me.  We can...  We'll cut off the end.  What's at the end?  Maybe the end's the whole punchline.  Might be the funniest, like, bit.  We could skip line.  Just tormenting her off.  Huh?  We could skip line.  We could skip line of the day?  What happened?  Oh, Derek, yes? 
[03:50:00]  Well, instead of discussing it, let's make a quick decision here.  I know.  We're just running out of time.  What happened?  Tick tock.  Well, it's 49 minutes, and then you've got 12 minutes of break.  And then it's...  I don't think it's...  Why don't we cut out the inane, stupid break stuff that doesn't make any difference?  Why don't we cut out the same commercial that has to play three or four times?  Yeah, cut out that.  It's a timing issue.  Cut out that.  Cut out everything.  Cut out promos for every show that everyone knows is on this channel.  Do we have to break it all?  You have to break three or four more times. 
[03:50:30]  Three or four more times?  A double out of this, and then one more time.  So we can talk about NCAA basketball for five straight minutes?  That's a bunch of bunk.  Harry?  When I listen to replays, and they have to pad by playing the same thing over and over again,  I want to jump out a window.  Just fucking...  Don't play it.  Granted, I live on the first floor, but I still want to jump out the window.  You would just look silly.  You would be the embarrassment.  Lindsay, you'd look out.  Honey?  Yeah, I'm just...  I can't take it anymore. 
[03:51:00]  People walking down the sidewalk looking at you all stupid.  Brushing glass off me.  You're fine, but your hat is askew.  I didn't want to hurt myself.  I just wanted to look silly.  All right, let's do line of the day.  You'll have to play the Earl bit another day.  That's what happens.  Earl quits the show tomorrow.  How's that?  Okay.  Because Friday, we'll leave early.  We'll sneak...  You know, that'll be our excuse tomorrow why we had to leave early.  Dude, you know, they make it seem like it's a joke, but I think it's serious that they  leave early. 
[03:51:30]  Shut up.  Quiet.  Line of the day sponsored by Bodogfight.com.  Here's one of the runner-up lines of the day.  You're sitting in an emergency room.  Yeah, I know.  You know how to work at this, and you will help other people get out.  Yeah, sure.  And that's it.  That's the whole job interview.  For the most important seat on the plane, they just say, would you be willing to do this?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why the burp? 
[03:52:00]  Why the burp, Bill?  Bill, comment?  That's left for the actual line of the day.  Yeah, it's saved over by accident, because when we were doing the...  Always a reason.  When we were doing it, so we...  Notice how he says we.  Yeah, we.  That includes other people.  Me and Dilett were in cahoots together.  Exactly.  All right, carry on.  It's obvious that you'll never get fired, so what the hell.  Have fun.  Bodogfight.com.  Look, he's freaking out.  He's freaking out.  Sponsors line of the day.  Why don't you go check out Bodogfight.com.  Here's another runner-up line.  Yeah, Billy boy.  Hey, hi.  What the fuck was that shit? 
[03:52:30]  I think this.  I think that.  I know, faggot.  There's only some faggot who isn't funny.  We don't need your so-and-so fashion.  And her dress was to die for.  Shut up, faggot.  I wouldn't be caught dead wearing a fat outfit.  Yes, you would if you continue that lifestyle.  Faggot.  That's just mean.  Anyone else notice all the lines of the day come from this part of the show?  Yeah.  Even though everyone says we call it in? 
[03:53:00]  Yeah.  We have another runner-up line of the day?  No, I think it's line of the day now.  It's time for line of the day, huh, Bill?  Please.  All right.  I've got 18 hours of production to do.  Whatever you want to hit it, Bill, no rush.  Apparently it's the fucking B&B show.  No, no, I don't know what I am.  Here comes line of the day.  Line of the day.  You're too tired, I'm not me. 
[03:53:30]  We take an aircraft and throw baby seals into the center of the eye of the hurricane.  The whirling mass of baby seal hides its blood and guts.  We'll slow the hurricane down.  Of course, in the event we don't have seals, we can use the Negro.  Jesus.  That was just mean, too.  Wow.  People are picking angry, nasty, mean lines of the day. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Jimmy, have fun in Albany.  I hope, you know, Godspeed.  I mean, you know, tomorrow and Saturday, two shows each night.  Let's just hope it goes well at the Comedy Works.  That's all I care about.  Safety.  And you're doing radio up there, hopefully?  Wolf tomorrow morning.  Bob Wolf?  I hope you.  Is it Bob?  I think so, yeah.  Or Dick?  Bob Bob.  That police shooting thing in Utah, that video they got.  Any cops get hurt?  Wow.  I don't know.  That's a year old, too, huh?  Is it?  That old?  I believe so.  All right.  Bye, guys. 
[03:54:30]  Have a nice evening.  We'll see you next week, Jimmy.  We certainly will.  We have another day of radio to do.  Monday morning.  Me, too.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  We have another day of radio to do in production.  How much?  We have to do those phone call things where somebody from various company will call, and  we have to do, like, an interview with them, like we're talking about the product with them,  and go, so, how easy is it to order?  And then they tell you and go, what is it about these that people really love?  And they talk, like we're conducting an interview. 
[03:55:00]  Have you noticed that they sometimes slow down our voices or speed them up?  Is that because it has to fit, like, 60 seconds or something, Steve?  The slowing down and the speeding up of Ant and I's voices?  We try not to do that too much.  Great for Valentine's Day.  No, it's great, too.  Did you hear something like that?  I don't know.  Maybe it was just me.  I was on acid at the time.  Oh, okay.  Might have just been me.  No, it's the greatest.  I listen to commercials on 202 during the replay. 
[03:55:30]  Yeah.  And I'm like, oh, wow, that's what Ant said after I said what I said.  Oh, I know, yeah.  Yeah, we're not even in the same room.  We're not in the same.  I'm driving.  I'm like.  I know, too, because Derek will just go read the highlighted part.  So I read my highlighted part.  Ant reads his highlighted part.  And it's supposed to be me and him talking back and forth.  I'm like, oh, wow.  That's my phone.  With that ringer?  Who's calling the gay men's health crisis?  It really is an awful one.  I got a text.  It's a beauty bill. 
[03:56:00]  Da, da, da.  Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.  Anthony, your truck is ready.  Poe.  Who else would say?  Why do they have to sign it?  His name comes up.  Can you do the quick Poe thing you were telling me this morning?  Which one?  I forgot about that.  Oh, yesterday when I was sick?  Everyone remembers Anthony had a tough day yesterday.  Holy shit.  Ends up puking and then he decides, you know, fuck driving home.  I'm going to crash.  I'm staying at the hotel.  Right.  So I just crashed at the hotel.  But I went to the front desk and, of course, Poe escorted me across the street. 
[03:56:30]  And when you're feeling like you did yesterday, all you want to do is just lay down in a bed.  But you still had to sign in.  It was check in.  Yeah, get the key.  Check in or whatever.  And she had a little problem.  Not a problem, but she wanted to check on the rate that she had given me.  So she went into the back and that took forever.  So I'm just standing there and Poe is standing next to me.  And he goes, yeah, you're not feeling too good.  I'm like, no, I feel like crap.  I just want to go to sleep.  I want to go to bed. 
[03:57:00]  And he goes, I know how those hangovers are.  You know, your head just spinning and spinning and you're all nauseous.  Your stomach's just kind of rumbling like you're going to puke and all the headaches that you get.  I turn around and I go, Poe, Poe, stop.  Because I swear, I was just standing there.  I was close to puking all over the desk.  And I had to concentrate not to puke on the desk.  Oh, that stomach, that nausea that just wipes over you.  You feel it just hit you. 
[03:57:30]  You're going to vomit.  And the head pounding, just pounding.  So I'm like, Poe, please, darling.  He goes, oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize.  And pats me on the back.  He hit me so hard in the back.  I guess I don't know my own strength.  Good to see you, Anthony.  Yeah, it's good to see you, Ralph.  From Utica.  I was going to vomit.  I was like, thank you.  Thank you, Poe. 
[03:58:00]  You can go now.  All right.  I swear, he almost made me vomit all over the desk of the Parker Meridian.  That's really funny.  Let's get the hell out of here.  We're out.  Albany.  See you tomorrow.  See you Monday.  All right.  It's time for another Opie and Anthony Show scream along.  Shut up.
