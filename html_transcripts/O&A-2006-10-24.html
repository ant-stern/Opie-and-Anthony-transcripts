<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  It began with a humorous bit about a rage-inducing virus, quickly shifting to a discussion of negative political campaign ads, using the Bob Menendez and Hillary Clinton campaigns as examples.  The hosts played clips of these ads, highlighting their misleading and often absurd nature, and lamented the lack of substantive political discourse.  This led to a discussion of similar tactics in other contexts, including violent video game advertising.  They played news clips debating the impact of violent video games and received calls from listeners, including a GameStop employee who recounted anecdotes about parents buying mature-rated games for their children. The hosts also highlighted the hypocrisy of the government’s stance on violent video games while simultaneously using them for military recruitment.  A significant portion was dedicated to the Opie and Anthony Fatty Pig Fatty Contest, announcing a new winner, Honey from Binghamton (initially misreported as weighing 55 pounds, prompting humorous discussion and a suggestion for a “lightest listener” contest).  The show also promoted their upcoming Halloween party and solicited listener-submitted negative campaign ads about themselves. Guests Ryan Starr and Howie Mandel were mentioned as being present.

The broadcast continued with the hosts observing a woman exercising in a nearby building, leading to a discussion about a New York City policy allowing transgender men to use women's restrooms in the MTA system. The hosts expressed their opinions on this, using offensive language and stereotypes.  They then satirized a lawyer's reaction to a controversial Yankee Christmas ornament released after a Yankee pitcher's death in a plane crash.  Ryan Starr, a musician, was interviewed in studio, performing two songs and discussing his career.  A heated exchange occurred with a caller named Debo, who accused the hosts of racism and perpetuating stereotypes.  This argument continued throughout multiple segments of the show, with Debo rejecting the hosts’ Arbitron ratings data.

The show featured multiple discussions about sex offenders concentrated in low-income areas of Long Island, fueled by calls from listeners, including Debo, whose calls were characterized by intense arguments and offensive language. The conversation also touched upon perceptions of black entertainers befriending white people.  Howie Mandel called in, sharing anecdotes from his career.  The show included the Opie and Anthony "walk-over" to their XM radio studio, filled with street encounters, including an interaction with a woman in stockings, the appearance of Opie's cousins, and Opie destroying a homeless man's cake.  Numerous listener calls, some expressing outrage at the cake incident, others finding it hilarious, punctuated the show.

The segment featuring the cake destruction was a focal point, with repeated references to the video recording of the incident and Andrew’s reaction. Jim Norton was a guest, promoting his appearances on *The Late Show with David Letterman* and a stand-up show.  A brief call from someone identifying as Ed Asner was mentioned.  The show also included a discussion on male and female circumcision, with graphic descriptions and personal anecdotes from the hosts and callers.  A news story about a beer keg explosion resulting in a fatality was briefly mentioned, along with further promotion of their upcoming Halloween party.

The broadcast included a phone call from Jennifer, discussing her son's circumcision and its effect on his penis size, resulting in a sexually explicit conversation.  This transitioned into a discussion of Anthony's political choices, the Iraq War, and President George W. Bush's "stay the course" policy.  A montage of Bush using this phrase was mentioned.  The show also featured a call from a couple, Brad and Darlene, hosting a 17-year-old Vietnamese exchange student, which led to a sexually suggestive conversation about their expectations and the student’s potential sexual preferences.  The concluding segment included promotion of upcoming guests (again including Jim Norton’s appearance on Letterman and their Halloween party), and a post-show meeting between the hosts containing sexually explicit and offensive language.  The show utilized various audio clips and referenced online platforms like YouTube and MySpace throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  I didn't know this was different.  The infection was everywhere.  It was in the street outside.  It was coming through your windows.  It was a virus.  Terrible viral infection gives people this incurable disease.  Fills their veins and blood with their pure rage.  By the time they tried to evacuate the cities, it was already too late.  Jesus Christ, five hours?  It infects, replicates, and kills this fast?  These numbers can't be right.  The numbers are correct.  I wish the God they wanted. 
[00:00:30]  It's that one.  There is no God.  It's like some kind of horror movie.  It's such a great virus that you want to infect others like your friends and coworkers.  Sometimes it leaves pustules.  There's nothing you can do about it.  God almighty.  You better stop this outbreak before it mutates.  They're highly contagious.  What's this rash from?  We're facing a new strain.  It can cause life-threatening bleeding or even asphyxiation.  Where is it spreading?  All over the place.  All right.  We're coming out.  Here we go. 
[00:01:00]  I'm a border.  Anthony.  I'm a little dirty.  Wipe me.  James Norton.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Outrage over Yankee playing Christmas Ornament. 
[00:01:30]  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Helena is happy today.  Huh?  Used to be known as Henry.  Oh.  See?  Going with the same type of name when you have your sex change operation.  Hillary is ugly.  Again.  See? 
[00:02:00]  What was Hillary's name before she got the sex change?  Hank.  Violent video games.  Take them out of the hands of teenagers.  What is this?  The best of?  No.  Jesus Christ.  We talk about this all the time.  Oh, it must be.  Oh, that's right.  November election is coming up.  They got to hit the hard-hitting, important issues like video games.  Negative campaign ads.  All right.  That I like.  It's the only fun thing about the elections.  Are the fact that these sleazebag politicians go after each other tooth and nail. 
[00:02:30]  No holds barred until they're elected.  Then they're the sweetest guys in the world.  You see the most heinous ad just lambasting some other guy.  And then they go, my name is blah, blah, blah, and I approve this ad.  And then the election's over.  And he's a nice guy again?  Or is he the same scumbag that approved the bashing, lying ads?  And it's both sides.  I'm not taking sides on this one.  Both Democratic and Republican ads are nothing but mudslinging now. 
[00:03:00]  I have no idea what any candidate really stands for.  But you know what trouble the other candidate got into based on who he's running against,  what stories they're spinning.  We got a great negative campaign ad we'll get to in a few minutes here.  I can't imagine this guy actually said, you know, I'm going to go into politics.  Because based on the other guy's ad on him, he should be locked up in jail, not running  for any office. 
[00:03:30]  So it can't be true.  I guess we're going to start with this.  This ad we saw, what, 15 minutes ago?  Oh, 15 minutes ago.  And I was looking at it.  My jaw was dropped.  And I just said, I go, how can this guy have said to his friends, yeah, I'm going to get  into politics?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Because it can't be true.  This is the other guy that made this ad.  He's lambasting this other politician and trying to tie him into all kinds of shenanigans. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, he's a bad boy.  Oh, it must be.  According to his opponent.  You want to hear this?  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, by the way, good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Of course it is.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Our first negative campaign ad of the season that we're playing.  This is the one that finally got our attention.  Oh, this one did.  Bob Menendez believes sometimes you just have to break the law.  Right away. 
[00:04:30]  The guy's a lawbreaker.  Good for Bob Menendez.  Bob Menendez believes sometimes you just got to kill a hooker.  What did he do?  And so that caught my attention right away.  I turn around and go, all right, I got to see what this guy's up to.  Bob Menendez says if there's grass in the field, play ball.  And he's not talking about baseball.  This is why I don't vote, by the way.  Bob Menendez took trips to Thailand with John Carr. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  Did he?  Can we get some ominous music so we can do this?  I think they got it in the background, don't they?  No, so we can do our version.  Oh, yeah.  And then people won't know which one is real and which one is open-ended.  Oh, I'm sure they won't.  Tim Norton, I don't think we're campaigning.  So he likes to break the law.  But this is why I don't vote.  I can't be bothered.  I can't be bothered with politicians in general.  Is there one thing?  I hate them all except for Obama! 
[00:05:30]  Stupid Obama.  Is there one?  Jimmy's eating right now, and I thought he was Obama for a second.  It's a joke for the room.  But rest assured.  No, it's a joke for white America.  I'm holding it with my hand.  All right, here we go.  Isn't that horrible?  Bob Menendez believes sometimes you just have to break the law.  Is that why he brought a convicted cocaine trafficker with him to the Senate? 
[00:06:00]  Wait, a what?  A convicted cocaine trafficker.  Oh, I thought he said a cooking chef.  That wouldn't be bad at all.  That's not breaking the law.  That's just silly.  Bob Menendez likes his eggs over easy.  All right, we'll play this all the way through.  Bob Menendez believes sometimes you just have to break the law.  Is that why he brought a convicted cocaine trafficker with him to the Senate for his swearing in?  Or why he used his office to do favors for imprisoned mobsters? 
[00:06:30]  Or why he wants to give your Social Security money to illegal aliens?  Or why he's under federal criminal investigation?  Well, Menendez believes sometimes you just have to break the law.  New Jersey deserves better.  I'm Tom Kane, Jr., and I approve this message.  Tom Kane, Jr.  Now, someone tell me from that ad, what does Tom Kane, Jr. stand for?  Yeah, I want to know what you stand for, Tom.  What is he going to do for Jersey?  There is not one ad that I see ever that has anything to do with what these mudslingers are actually going to do for their state. 
[00:07:00]  But you know what the other guy's been up to.  Oh, you know the shenanigans he's been up to.  Now, I want to know what the real story is behind the cocaine trafficker.  Is it some guy who got busted, like, in 1968 with, like, a half a gram on him?  Probably.  Because that's usually the way these stories end up.  And then the other thing, he wants to give your Social Security money to illegal aliens. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  That's probably another one of those bills that we talk about that it sounds good, but then it's piled up with other bad bills.  So there was this thing where Social Security money wouldn't be deflected to illegal aliens.  But attached to the bill is like something where nuclear waste will be buried in all of New Jersey.  And the guy decides, no, I'm not going to sign that.  I can't sign that.  They don't talk about that side of the bill.  They just talk about the thing that's attached to it.  And going back to the cocaine thing, you think this guy might have been, like, a drug mule or something? 
[00:08:00]  There's probably a couple lines at a fraternity house in college.  Yeah, that's always the way.  It's not like he's bringing up, what's his name, Escobar or something?  Right, right, right, right.  The Olympian drug cartel is up there going, hey, this is great.  I like this inauguration.  This is good stuff.  Shoot that son of a bitch.  That's actually not true.  I did see an interview with Bob Menendez.  Oh, did you?  And he said that he did indeed approve of drug trafficking.  And an old lady went, what about my Social Security?  And he said, I'm giving it to a foreigner. 
[00:08:30]  Beat it.  Oh, okay.  Well, then vote for the other guy.  What can I say?  Hey, we got a pro Bob Menendez.  Ooh.  Really?  Yeah, they just ran it in.  Let's listen to this.  So what we learned about him from what?  Tom?  Is it Tom Keen?  Tom Keen Jr., yeah.  Tom Keen Jr.  Keen or Keen, whatever.  Keen.  Oh, it's not Tom Keen.  Wasn't there a Tom Keen?  I don't know.  Oh, Tom Keen, let's say.  See what happens?  You know the other guy's name more from the other guy's commercial.  So he does favors for the mob. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  With Bob Menendez.  He'll break the MMMMMM.  MMMM Mendez.  Breaks the law.  Right.  Breaks the law.  Right.  Cocaine.  Brought cocaine's guy to his inauguration.  Used his office to do favors for imprisoned mobsters.  Yeah.  And gives Social Security money to illegal aliens.  All right.  All right.  Pull the lever.  Not according to Bob himself.  Really?  Here's his pro ad.  I'm Senator Bob Menendez, and I approve this message.  Federal Prisoner 250-38050. 
[00:09:30]  He's Tom Keen Jr.'s newest advisor.  He's Tom Keen Jr.'s.  He's Dope.  He's Dope.  They give him the number.  It's just the number they give out.  What a dope.  How are you supposed to make a decision?  The majority of the people out there are not going to pick up different magazines and newspapers  and read about these guys.  This is what they base their voting on. 
[00:10:00]  Right.  Who's bashed least?  Do they tell you what these guys do?  What their plans are for the state?  Holy Jesus.  Punch a friggin' – they're all criminals.  Can't wait to see the ads in Florida.  My opponent likes girls who are over 18.  Yuck.  I'm Mark Foley, and I approve this ad.  Oh, God. 
[00:10:30]  Newest advisor.  The Star Ledger reports Keen Jr. conspired with a convicted felon to smear Bob Menendez.  The Times says Keen Jr.'s smears are, quote, wholly unsupported by the facts.  The truth?  Keen Jr. sides with George Bush, would stay the failed course in Iraq, privatize Social Security,  and Keen Jr. will say anything to hide that.  So they're tying him to Bush, which is bad.  Well, that's what the Democrats are doing in this election.  The Democrats try to dig up every bit of video of their opponent with Bush. 
[00:11:00]  Doesn't matter what the hell he's doing.  He's passing him on the street.  They do the slow motion, grainy, black-and-white photography of them just passing on the street.  He once got this close to George Bush.  He's in the same stadium for a baseball game.  Satellite photo.  See?  He's sitting in left field, and George is behind the plate.  One of Bush's buddies. 
[00:11:30]  Unbelievable.  What do they stand for?  I have no idea.  I don't care.  They stand for the fact that they just love beating up on the opponent.  Right.  And it's an insult to their constituency to do this.  It really is an insult.  But that's all it's turned into these days.  And Jersey especially.  They learned from that last election.  Who the hell was that one?  Courtesine.  Yeah, Courtesine.  And Forrester.  That was one of the dirtiest campaigns I've ever seen and most hysterical, hilarious. 
[00:12:00]  Didn't they get, like, mistresses and ex-wives?  They brought in everything.  They brought in a guy's ex-wife to just spill the beans.  One of them was accusing the other guy of being, like, not cavorting with criminals, being a criminal.  Never fast enough.  I saw one the other day.  It was pretty interesting.  Did you see the Bob Menendez one?  No.  It said, Tom Kane, Jr.  His wife is a f***ing lover. 
[00:12:30]  Wow.  Jesus.  Well, who I'm voting for.  Yeah.  I don't even live there.  What was the other one we saw, I think, last week?  The mob tape?  Yeah.  This is another strategy they're using in the election campaigns.  They take the opponent and use some kind of recording of him and make it sound like using sound.  They go into the studio and grainy up the audio and make it sound really like it was a hidden. 
[00:13:00]  Just to make it sound very naughty.  Like there was a scam going on.  Yeah.  And they had to hide a tape recorder.  Right.  And they make it sound that way.  Like they had to get a bug in a light.  As he's talking about somebody in his own party that maybe isn't in the best of light right now.  Yeah.  And they talk about it like there's a scandal going on.  And they double up some of the words.  Like, yeah, he came over for a meeting and, you know, we got to do what he tells us to do. 
[00:13:30]  Got to do what he tells us to do.  Get the papers.  Get the papers.  Get the papers.  They double up the incriminating part of the conversation.  And it's all – there's another grainy black and white photograph of the guy.  And the tape has obviously been tampered with to where it's grainy and hard to hear almost.  Yeah.  But you can hear the key words.  They show the tape rolling and then they have to, you know, transcribe whatever.  Yeah.  What's on the tape.  They put subtitles on.  It sounds like the FBI listening in on the mob. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, because, you know, the FBI tapes are always the worst quality tapes.  Yeah.  Way to go, guys.  Jesus.  They're the ones.  You can go to YouTube and see anything you want perfectly clear.  Right.  But for some reason when the FBI is involved or anything, it's all grainy and you can't see any video or hear any audio.  So they try to make it sound like that because people know that that's kind of a – well, they must have had to hide the tape recorder.  He must be under some kind of investigation if they're hiding tape recorders.  But no, it's just some kind of a tape phone call or public record, something like that.  But if you make it sound like it's supposed to be evil and hidden, then people get this – where did they get this? 
[00:14:30]  Where did they get this tape?  Oh, this is a coup.  I've got to vote for the other guy.  Oh, wait a minute.  Here's a commercial for the other guy.  Oh, my God.  He's a criminal.  Oh, he eats children.  Oh, my God.  He's a child.  Rapist.  What?  He chewed right through a baby's neck.  Oh, it's just the worst.  But it's a lot of fun to listen to.  Oh, you've got to love late October early November.  You can't take any of these ads seriously.  They just bash each other and you get no info on what their stance is on anything. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, and the next week we want to start playing negative campaign ads.  And this happens everywhere.  Every city in America.  Every little town.  Jersey is exceptionally bad.  Well, maybe, Bob, well, the challenge is that maybe there's another city out there that  has a race and the negative campaign ads are worse than Jersey.  Yeah.  You can send them in by emailing, I guess, Danny?  Danny at foundrymusic.com or steve at foundrymusic.com.  Send in your negative campaign ads from your local races, okay? 
[00:15:30]  Right.  Danny at foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Let's go to Joe.  What's up, Joe?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Those tapes, there wasn't even Bob Menendez on the tape.  It was some guy that supposedly worked for him.  That was just, and they keep repeating the same thing over, and Bob Menendez wants you  to do it.  Yeah.  Bob Menendez wants you to do it.  They try to make it sound like he's a mob boss.  Right.  Remember in the last election, they actually used Dem bosses, like as the Democrat bosses. 
[00:16:00]  Dem bosses.  Dem bosses.  He goes, and he caved in to Dem bosses, trying to make a boss.  Boss is a mob term.  Right.  He must be.  Here it is.  Cocaine trafficker.  Look, watch it.  Menendez sworn in Diaz.  Menendez assisted members of crime family.  They have like now black and white, like almost night vision of illegal aliens running through 
[00:16:30]  a fence.  Federal criminal investigation.  Menendez believes sometimes you have to break the law.  They showed illegals running across the border waving.  Yeah.  With night vision.  Like Menendez is holding the bottom of the chain link fence up.  Right.  And letting them in.  And then they show like elderly people going hungry.  Yeah.  And I think they're probably trying to slant the little race, use the race card because  his last name being Menendez.  Sure.  Trying to, you know, scare Whitey into the fact that, look, you know, he might have sympathy 
[00:17:00]  for these people.  He's going to use your social security money.  Look, I'm a nice white guy.  Keene's my name and I'm white.  Vote for me.  I got a nice white name.  Bunch of white hands pulling that lever in the voting booth.  That's right.  With nice manicured nails.  Of course.  Let's go to Jim.  Paper cuts from money.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, Jim, what's up?  Hey, Jim, you're on the air.  How you doing, Jim?  Come on, we're off to a great start. 
[00:17:30]  We need you listeners to be on the same page as us.  No, the guy running against Hillary Clinton yesterday said she had face work done.  Yeah.  He's trying to claim that Hillary had, what, a facelift or something?  Said she, yeah, yesterday the headline was ugly.  Yeah.  Like ugly or something.  And this guy's claiming that she was ugly and she got all kinds of surgery to make herself  look like she does now.  Is this guy really reaching? 
[00:18:00]  I mean, she was never, you know, the looker, but she was just your average brainiac looking  student from the old days.  There it is.  Getting ugly.  Spencer's wacky charge.  Hill needed millions in surgery to make her pretty.  Now, you look at an old picture of her.  She looks like any average girl out of a yearbook from 1930.  Whatever the hell.  Like she was on the yearbook staff.  Yeah.  She just looked like.  The class, like, vice president.  Goody gumdrops. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  She was, you know, the drama club, maybe.  She looked better then, actually.  She doesn't look bad.  I know.  That's it.  She looks better in the older picture than she does in the recent picture.  So.  Yeah.  I don't know.  This guy.  But that's just, that's the gist of all of these ads.  It's just how can you bash the other guy and not let anyone know what I actually stand  for?  Because you know something?  I don't even know.  Because it's too scary for a politician to take a stand.  If a politician made an ad saying, here's what I want to do, bump, bump, bump, and spelt 
[00:19:00]  out what he wants to do, he knows too many people would go, no.  No, I don't like that.  I don't like that.  I don't like two out of the five.  Yeah.  So I might not vote for him.  Right.  So what they do is completely eliminate what they stand for.  That way it takes out of the mix any chance that someone's going to not like him and bash  the other guy so that everyone doesn't like him and you win with people having no knowledge  of what you're about.  That's what politics has turned into.  Thanks a lot. 
[00:19:30]  And occasionally they jump out on TV during this time too to complain about things like  video games, violent video games.  Yeah, we got a video game story in a little while.  And all the easy targets, shock jocks have come up in the past, things like that.  The easy targets that anybody is going to get behind the way they present it.  Like they know parents are going to be like, well, I want to protect my children.  Right.  This guy seems like a nice man.  He wants to take violent video games off so there's not another Columbine.  Oh, is that what did it? 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, that's exactly what did it.  It was an awful parenting.  You dope.  More government, please shove more government down our throats.  Can we do that?  Here's the mob tape that we were just talking about.  Oh, you got that one.  Oh, yeah.  Listen to this.  Listen carefully to Bob Menendez's top lieutenant pressuring a doctor.  Lieutenant.  Okay.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Again.  A mob term.  Yep.  Lieutenant.  His top lieutenant.  That's a mob term.  I would vote for the mob every time, by the way.  You got it.  They'll kick your ass.  No problem. 
[00:20:30]  I vote for the mob every time out.  Does anyone see the sleaziest?  They're more honest than the stupid politicians.  The sleaziest form of campaigning you could possibly.  It's fear tactics.  They're scaring you.  They're trying to make it sound like this guy is in the mob.  Bob Menendez dozed off while eating salmon.  He sleeps with the fishes.  This November, you can act like a man and vote for Keene. 
[00:21:00]  All right.  Here we go.  Listen carefully to Bob Menendez's top lieutenant pressuring a doctor in a Menendez kickback scheme.  We always have to put my daughter in the room.  We always have to do it.  We always have to do it.  We always have to do it.  We always have to do it.  It would make sense for you.  By the way, you're not supposed to understand what is being said because I'm sure people out there are going, what?  But on the TV commercial, they transcribe what is being said.  There's subtitles.  And you can hear where the tape is doubled up. 
[00:21:30]  You can hear it.  Where they cut it, double it.  Because the strategy is if you can't understand what is being said, they had to go really deep into the organization to get this audio.  Right.  There's a wire on somebody.  Right.  They wired someone up.  Right.  And it's so hidden because if the wire was found, of course, Menendez would have killed them personally.  Yeah, of course.  Personally.  So as you sit here and try to understand what's being said, you're not supposed to understand what's being said.  No.  They tell you what is being said.  Yeah.  Because they know because they have a crystal clear version of what you're hearing. 
[00:22:00]  Of course they do.  How is that legal?  It shouldn't be.  Well, I guess it is legal when it comes to negative campaign ads.  They are running them like crazy today.  Well, please send them in.  If you've got one in your town, send them in.  Send it to danny at foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  All right.  Here's the rest of the tape.  The tape from the lieutenant.  I'm Tom Kane, Jr., and I approve this message. 
[00:22:30]  You did, you scumbag.  You did.  Bunch of dopes.  And, of course, the other guy is just as big a douche to me.  I have no idea.  I have no idea.  He's smearing also, and no one knows what they stand for.  Good luck, Jersey.  Good luck.  This is your choice.  In his spare time, Anthony dresses up like a Nazi. 
[00:23:00]  I do.  Vote for Opie, most popular person on the Opie and Anthony show.  What?  What happened?  There have been allegations that I dress like a Nazi.  No, actually, you never hear them talk.  It's always somebody else talking.  There have been allegations Anthony dresses like a Nazi.  He's collected some memorabilia because he just likes the era.  Ask yourself why Anthony hangs out outside the junior high school. 
[00:23:30]  Wait a minute.  That's where my office is.  Office schmoffice, kid toucher.  Opie yells at people a lot.  I'm Iraq, and I approve that message.  All right, we're on to something.  We'll continue in just a minute.  We're just getting started today.  We've got some nice energy.  Let's keep it going today.  Negative campaign ads, though.  I'm telling you, because we're broadcasting pretty much around the world.  If we do the Howie math, we're being heard in, I don't know, the whole solar system at this point. 
[00:24:00]  You know, radio signals do leave the atmosphere and travel infinite amounts of distance, so you never know.  There could be alien worlds listening to this show.  Absolutely.  But we know there's some good negative campaign ads in your town and your city, so please send them in to us.  Once again, Danny at foundrymusic.com.  Are you going to vote for a man who can't even get an apartment in New York City?  Vote for a man with a home.  Vote Anthony. 
[00:24:30]  Or most popular person on the Opie Anthony show.  Jim Norton, have you seen what he has sex with?  I'm any opponent of Jim Norton's, and I approve this message.  By the way, Hillary, I'm looking at this picture.  I'm not saying she, if I had to guess, I would guess Botox more than a, yeah, they do Botox.  Yeah, get a few of the wrinkles out.  Yeah, the old broads do the Botox.  She has a little chubby cheeks around, she looks like, you know, she looks like, she looks like Anthony Hopkins puppet in Magic. 
[00:25:00]  Hot.  With a little chub around the cheeks and a little thin, it's thin around the mouth, she looks like a puppet.  Yeah.  Oh boy, we get it, campaign ads are negative, move the F on.  Why don't you move, you move the F on and go listen to a morning zoo.  Yeah, mister.  You douche.  John in Tennessee, what's up?  Yeah, last night on TV, I saw an ad.  I think it was Republicans against the Democrats. 
[00:25:30]  And they said this guy was, the Democrat was in association with some foreign producer.  And then at the end of it, there was this nice blonde chick.  And I looked in the camera and said, call me.  So I don't know if he had some association with her.  If he did, you know, that would be fine with me.  Well, you think it was Democrats versus Republicans, sir?  Who else would it be?  The Green Party versus the Whigs?  The Whigs. 
[00:26:00]  The Whigs had some good ideas.  I like, I'm a Whig.  The Whigs.  They had a good idea.  Let's bring them back.  Well, you know what stopped it?  Is actually, if you were in that party, you were called a Wigger.  All right, we got lots to do today.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  I can walk on my hands.  I can fart and chew gum.  I play the over.  I can ride a unicycle.  I wear a bra and laced panties.  So your talent is being queer, Travis?  It's the Opie and Anthony Walkover Talent Show.  If you have a unique skill, talent, music group, or physical affliction, we want to exploit. 
[00:26:30]  You can email steve at foundrymusic.com with your ideas.  Or you can just show up during the walk to XM and start shucking and jiving.  Shucking and jiving?  Jesus, Danny.  I don't write this sh**.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA Uncut and Live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit xmradio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:27:00]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  1-866-313-FREE is our phone number.  Write that down.  You're going to need it eventually.  The Opie and Anthony Halloween Party is brought to you by Saw 3.  If it's Halloween, it must be Saw.  In theaters everywhere Friday.  I haven't seen one Saw movie, by the way.  You've got to see them.  They're pretty cool.  Real creepy.  A bunch of uncomfortable situations that people are put in. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Very uncomfortable.  Uncomfortable is kind of a...  Maybe I should have used a different word.  By the way, a lot of confusion.  Life-threatening.  Our Halloween Party is going to be at the Hard Rock Cafe, what, a week from today?  Yeah.  Is it a week from today?  Halloween is a week from today, I believe?  Yeah.  Okay.  And I don't know how they're giving the tickets away.  I'm hearing you've got to listen to this station here in New York after our show to get tickets or something.  Really?  That's interesting.  Can we just give away tickets?  We want to give away tickets on our show to our people. 
[00:28:00]  Can we do that?  We also want people to be able to get tickets night of the show.  Yeah.  A lot.  We also want half the tickets for our XM listeners.  Right.  There's wheeling and dealing going on behind the scenes and we weren't even involved in it.  When do they expect us to do this?  We have less than a week or a week as of today.  We're not here for Saturday, Sunday.  Supposed to push things like this for like a month. 
[00:28:30]  I guess we should just mention it Monday at 8.20 and people will show up.  Yeah.  And we're a bunch of dopes because we didn't even want to broadcast the thing.  Now we're broadcasting our Halloween party, which means we have to worry about putting on an actual radio show.  When last year was just kind of a hang.  We did throw it on XM last year, but we told everyone, look, it's going to be a cluster app.  Yeah.  But you get to listen in and they still complain.  But now we're syndicated across America.  We're pretty much the hottest show on XM and now we have to worry about making our Halloween party sound good for a radio audience. 
[00:29:00]  Making it sound good.  We told people like right when we were hired over there at XM, we said we're going to do some events and things and just kind of turn the mics on and it'll be voyeuristic.  We won't be doing a show because we have to entertain a live audience and do things in a live venue.  But, you know, we turn the mics on and it's kind of voyeuristic.  Right.  Something different.  People just didn't understand that.  They don't understand the concept.  They think every time you turn on the radio, it has to be perfect.  Why?  This sucks.  I'm hearing like, you know, dead spots. 
[00:29:30]  And then you can't hear someone because it's off the mic.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Then don't listen.  Don't listen.  What do you want?  We told you we weren't going to do a polished show.  Yeah.  But they still complained.  But this year now we have to, you know, have to worry about how it sounds.  We're wimps.  I didn't want to broadcast a Halloween show, but they beat us down.  They beat us down.  Had no desire to broadcast the show live.  It's the crossover point we have to reach. 
[00:30:00]  We have to reach that.  It can all be graphed out.  It's our power to the crap we have to eat kind of graph.  And when those meet and then we pass in power, which of course means ratings and things,  then we, you know, turn into the old Opie and Anthony.  So at the beginning we had to kiss a little ass, you know, agree to certain things, compromise,  because we were starting our careers over again, Opie.  Right, right, right.  And then time goes by and they'll get the ONA that Infinity Broadcasting remembered. 
[00:30:30]  Don't you worry about it.  All right, Charles, or Charlie, sorry, Charlie from Philly has a great idea.  We're going to run with this.  We love listener ideas.  Charlie writes on the instant feedback, this S is hilarious.  There should be another contest for best production piece, negative campaign ad,  for favorite member of the ONA show.  So you've got to bash another member of the show. 
[00:31:00]  You could use anyone.  You could use myself, Anthony, Jim Norton.  You could use E-Rock.  Maybe E-Rock is your favorite member of the Opie and Anthony show.  That's right, Mr. and Mrs. Nagel.  Maybe Than.  Sarcastic Than.  Maybe he's your favorite member.  Maybe it's Steve C.  Maybe it's Club Soda Kenny.  But you're not campaigning for these people.  It's against the other people.  Well, but you have to go, you know.  Yeah.  Steve C. approves of this message.  Paid for by friends of Steve C.  That's right.  Yes, it is. 
[00:31:30]  Let's do negative campaign ads as far as the Opie and Anthony show goes.  Negative campaign ads.  Send them in to Steve at foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Is that email up on opiananthony.com?  We make it easy for the people?  All right.  There you go.  Charlie, very good idea from Philly.  Let's make negative campaign ads that have something to do with the Opie and Anthony show.  Okay?  Like it.  All right.  Moving on.  Stay the course.  Yeah, whatever. 
[00:32:00]  Sex offenders.  Stay the course.  You know what?  We're talking about politics.  Why don't we do the video game story?  I'm done.  I'm done with these politicians.  It's, here's the easy.  Going after the soft target.  Easy target.  It gets their name out there.  Gets them some FaceTime on TV.  Close to the election.  And no one can debate them on it because it's an issue that you have to stay on the same side with.  Yeah, what politician's going to debate?  No, we need more violence in video games.  And we need it accessible by the children.  Pornography is good.  It's always the safe way to go. 
[00:32:30]  So it's a safe bet.  Let's ignore drug use in our junior highs and our high schools.  Let's not try to take care of that problem.  The real problem is violent video games.  Yeah.  Violent video games getting in the hands of minors.  That's just setting the world on fire.  You understand what's going on in your schools?  The politicians know, but they don't want to get too involved.  No.  It's too much heavy lifting.  So they go after these obvious easy things like stupid violent video games. 
[00:33:00]  Because if they say something that they're going to fix something of substance, then they have to come up with the money for it.  And that's a problem.  So that when they can't come up with the money for it, then they never make their promise of fixing whatever it was they said they were going to fix.  And the next election comes around and his opponent calls him a liar.  Right.  There you go.  So the best just not touch it at all.  All right.  Well, here's the latest.  Is this, like you said, is this like a best of Opie and Anthony show?  Yeah, I know.  Because they constantly come out of the woodwork around election time. 
[00:33:30]  We're talking about video games whose content is such we can't show you a lot of it here on TV.  Really?  Really?  You showed pretty much all of it.  It's guys shooting.  Guys shooting.  That's pretty much it.  They showed Grand Theft Auto, the king of violent video games.  There was small sexual sequences, but they had to be unlocked.  And the main gist of the game is the shooting and violence.  You could show that.  Show it every day on the real news. 
[00:34:00]  What, once you animate it, it's a problem?  Yeah, I'm proud to say that all of us are going to be part of the new Grand Theft Auto game.  Yeah.  Sight and proud to be part of it.  It's a great, great video game.  So that bowling alley brawl where two gangs were beating the crap out of each other with bats and poles and everything?  That was the video of the day yesterday.  Yes.  So that, and that was on TV.  That was real people.  But once you put them in computer form and have them do the same thing, then there's a problem.  Yeah. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, why don't you go after gangs and gang violence?  Yeah, how about that?  Why don't you go after that?  Mm-hmm.  Ain't gonna happen.  Wouldn't touch that now, would you?  Here on TV, and noting that, one legislator says those games need to be more tightly regulated, but not everyone agrees.  What you're watching is a video game rated M for mature.  Like all games with that rating, it's packaging warns players about graphic violence and sex, but one local legislator says that's not warning enough. 
[00:35:00]  We have to give parents every advantage possible and every piece of information that they could possibly have to help them be better parents.  No one, once they see these video games, wants their child to have them.  What?  No one, once they see the game, wants their child to have them.  Now, they said it's rated M for mature on the box.  It says contains sex and violence on the box.  But for some reason, this guy is saying, parents need more. 
[00:35:30]  What more do you need?  What more do you need?  And how about poking your head in to your kid's room to see what he's playing?  See what they're playing and only you know what they can handle.  I tell the story of my nephew all the time.  He grew up playing Doom as a little kid, and back in the day, that was the violent video game.  He's now 19, and he's pre-med.  He's totally normal.  You know why?  Because my sister and my brother-in-law knew exactly what Jason could handle as a kid. 
[00:36:00]  He was watching R-rated movies as like a six or seven-year-old.  It would be funny if Jason becomes a male nurse and just smuggles people.  But it comes down to that.  You parent, and you try to figure out what your own kid could handle.  And if your kid comes home with a game, and he's playing on the computer, you would think a parent could just poke his head in.  Say, hey, what did you get today?  Let me look at that.  I think there's a little too much for you. 
[00:36:30]  It shouldn't be up to the government to regulate what's for sale out there.  Because, again, if the gaming companies have to regulate their product so much, they're not going to make a profit.  And they go down the drain.  And what you end up with is the adults that like playing these games, because for some reason they figure it's only kids playing these games, get a crappier choice of game.  They get crappier games, cheaper games.  Because no one's buying them.  Right. 
[00:37:00]  And they're regulating the games.  They already are regulating the games.  They got them right on the box.  You don't need more.  But now they're trying to explain that most parents don't understand what that means, and they need to be educated more.  They don't understand.  Big M.  He's proposed legislation requiring signs listing what each video game rating means be posted in every store which sells video games.  But not every store sees the need for the legislation.  It can't hurt, but who would read it? 
[00:37:30]  People don't read signs already.  He's not convinced that the proposed requirement for signs would help.  He is convinced what's needed is greater enforcement of the current warnings.  If a little kid comes in on his own, I won't sell him a game that's rated mature, what's his gore, violence, sexual content.  They have to come in with their parents.  But the legislator says more warnings promote more safety and fewer hard feelings.  They have a responsibility to the community and to the parents of these kids to let them know exactly what's on the video games they're buying. 
[00:38:00]  Because once they buy these video games and take them home and try them out and see what's actually on them, then they can't return them.  He says his legislation has already gone through committee, and he hopes it's passed by the full Nassau County legislature before the Christmas retail season.  Oh, God.  God.  God.  I didn't buy something as a kid and just have it taken away back in the old days.  I remember buying a wrist rocket. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, was I happy.  A wrist rocket?  They used to just sell those.  You'd go into, like, a store and buy a wrist rocket.  It's a slingshot, but it was kind of a modernized one made out of aluminum.  And there was a brace that came off the bottom of it and went over the top of your wrist so you could pull that thing back.  And it's braced on your forearm.  And it was surgical tubing connected to this metal tubing.  And you could.  Oh, OK.  I mean, this thing was potent. 
[00:39:00]  And I brought one home at, like, 10.  And I remember just my father, you know, going, what is that?  He goes, oh, it's a slingshot.  He goes, oh, yeah?  Let me see it.  He looked at it and said, no.  No.  And I'm like, but I spent my money.  He goes, tough S.  And that was the last I saw the wrist rocket.  I think after a few Schaffers, he had some beer cans set up on the fence.  And him and his buddies were knocking him down with my wrist rocket.  Just the same dad that gave you guns when you were 12. 
[00:39:30]  And a hooker.  And a hooker.  She wasn't a hooker.  She was a friend of the family.  Buzz was a hooker.  You just didn't know it.  She wasn't a hooker.  Buzz was a hooker.  She was not a hooker.  That was her name?  It was Christine.  Oh, all right.  But her nickname was Buzz.  I think she liked vodka or gin.  Or she was Devin Rattray.  Hey, we got Walter.  Buzz from Home Alone, you tool.  Let's go to Walter.  Walter. 
[00:40:00]  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Morning.  Morning, Walter.  I got three kids here.  I got my oldest one is 21 and my youngest one is 13.  Of course I want my oldest one to have the game so I can play it on his nice computer.  But I don't want my 13-year-old to have it.  He's not ready for it yet.  I'm the responsible parent.  I know what's going on.  Wow.  What do you do without a congressman in your house?  Holy Jesus.  You mean you have to actually do your own parenting?  Yeah.  Wow.  It's a tough job.  You know, it was 20 minutes of pleasure. 
[00:40:30]  I got 20 years of hell with the kids in the house.  It's people like you that ruin it, my friend, because people like you make it so government  doesn't have to come into your house.  God, what would we do if there were more people like this guy?  I don't know.  I don't know.  We'd be in so much trouble.  I don't know.  I don't know.  That's all I got.  I don't like this, man.  I don't know.  Bunch of wastes.  Let's go to Sean on Long Island.  Sean, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I used to be a store manager at GameStop, and I used to have to tell the people that 
[00:41:00]  they, when they were coming in to buy the game for their kids, that it was a mature-rated  game, and I had a lady once tell me that I had it all wrong, that Grand Theft Auto 3  taught her seven-year-old Tyler Reeves.  Oh, there you go.  That's awesome.  All right.  All right.  Very good.  Punch it out.  Let's say hi to Kyle on Long Island.  Kyle, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  I also work at GameStop.  I have parents every single day.  Tell them that the game's rated M.  There are about 30 parents a day buying their kids M-rated games. 
[00:41:30]  They really don't care.  They don't care.  No.  And they know it's not affecting their kids.  It's not a big issue.  The politicians try to make it sound like it's a big issue, and it's not.  We just tell them, and you know what?  They say, oh, they watch horror movies all the time.  I tell them there's sexual content.  Oh, they say, oh, that's great.  The fact is, we all love living in the fantasy world, whether it's going to movies or playing  our video games, it doesn't mean that we're going to turn into, you know, freaks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's usually the black parents who have about 18 kids, so it really doesn't matter. 
[00:42:00]  You check out old cartoons lately and see all the violence they have taken out of the  cartoons?  Yep.  Why?  Why do they do that?  We grew up on those cartoons.  Yeah, look.  We're normal.  With society completely out of control because of Bugs Bunny cartoons, but now you watch an  old Bugs Bunny cartoon and all the violence is taken out.  Some of the great racial references, they change everything, take all that stuff out.  They're editing them.  Yep.  Yeah.  They're editing all those out.  You could get them, though, on DVD, but you'll never see them on TV.  Like Wabbit Season, Duck Season, classic episode where Elmer Fudd just shoots Daffy square 
[00:42:30]  in the face, point-blank range with a shotgun, and his bill goes around the back of his head  and he puts it back in place and says he's despicable.  But now they cut it out.  They actually show a frozen frame of Bugs Bunny sitting on, like, the edge of his rabbit  hole, and it's a freeze frame.  It's just a still picture, and you hear a gunshot, and then it goes to Daffy's face all 
[00:43:00]  blackened and his bill moved, but you never see him shooting Daffy in the face with a  gun.  Yeah.  Because, oh, perish the thought.  It's funny that we're complaining, why did they take the man shooting the other person  in the face with a gun reference?  And we're saying, why did they take that out for kids?  It's not a person, it's a duck.  Well, you know what I mean.  Yeah, but we saw it as kids, and it didn't affect us.  It didn't.  I never looked at that.  Like, wow, this is something that I have to do.  Or, oh, wow, if you could do it, if he could do it to the duck, then I could do it, you know, 
[00:43:30]  to a person.  You could shoot him in the face.  Growing up, you just, you figure these things out for yourself, or you're taught these things.  It comes down to this.  You could do all this stuff.  You could ban violent video games and try to have this perfect society, but the reality  is there's just bad eggs out there.  Yeah, and it doesn't matter what's out there.  Unfortunately, there's a very, very, very tiny, small percentage of bad eggs out there.  That's it.  No matter what you do, that's going to continue through society. 
[00:44:00]  Let's go to Matt in Boston.  Matt, what's up?  How much, dude?  I mean...  You're 14, Matt?  Huh?  You're 14 years old?  Yeah, I'm 14 years old.  And whenever I go to, like, Best Buy or anything to get a violent video game, because, like,  I love them.  I'm addicted to them.  Who doesn't?  They always tell me and my mom that this is a violent video game.  Do you still want to buy it?  And she's like, yeah.  So, I mean, politicians can't really do anything more than that. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, you're being warned.  What's your favorite video game, Matt?  I have to say Grand Theft Auto and maybe, like, Black or something.  I mean, it's just awesome video games and you can do whatever you want.  GTA's great.  It's just so open-ended, you know?  You can jump on it at any time that you don't have to, like...  It's not like, oh, I forgot where I was.  You just jump on and start racking head.  Yeah.  Do you have a desire to shoot people out there, Matt?  I have a desire to shoot people every day, but I don't do it because I'm not stupid. 
[00:45:00]  See?  That's just...  That is as honest as you can.  That's everybody.  Yeah, he's just growing up in America.  Hey, Matt, wait a minute.  Did you play bully yet?  Do you want to play bully?  Yeah.  Uh, no.  Okay.  All right, thank you, Matt.  All right, thanks a lot.  Jimmy's in that game.  I just want to know if it's any good.  Jimmy's voice.  I keep seeing posters for it.  I wonder if it's...  There's a review in the paper today.  From bully?  Yeah, I didn't read it, but I think it's...  Is it by Linda Stassi?  I hope not.  I'll want to get into her a little later.  Smash her again.  Yeah, we'll do that.  Jay in Boston, what's up? 
[00:45:30]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  What's up, man?  All right, so I guess when the kids turn 18, it's all right to play the real game of shooting.  They're killing, but, you know, when they're 15 or 16, they don't approve of that?  Yeah, Jay's talking about, obviously, Iraq.  If violent video games had an effect on society, don't you think kids would be lining up to  join the war?  You could legally do exactly what you're doing in the game.  Right.  Come on, it's great.  Where are all these kids that are being influenced by violent video games?  The line would be down the street.  Right. 
[00:46:00]  You don't be a politician.  There are a lot of very popular military games.  Some of the most popular genre out there are the military games.  Isn't that how they train a lot of the soldiers?  The Army has a very popular one out right now.  What's the name of it, Dan?  America's Army.  America's Army.  And the United States Army put it out, and it's great.  It's really good.  It teaches you tactics, and you've got to work in a squad.  All right, Jay.  Thank you. 
[00:46:30]  Good point.  Thanks, guys.  All right, we've got to take a break.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We've got Ryan Starr here today.  What's Ryan doing for us?  Playing in and out of breaks or something?  Yeah, I think so.  All right, we'll talk to Ryan Starr.  We've got Howie Mandel calling in today.  Just don't understand that.  How the government can come up against violent video games like that, yet the United States  government put out a violent first-person shooter.  I mean, it's blood, it's shooting, it's, it's, how do they justify that one? 
[00:47:00]  Unbelievable.  Hypocrites.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony Fatty Pig Fatty Contest has been rejuvenated thanks to a visit from  a very girthy honey from Binghamton, New York, who tipped the scales at 505 pounds and obliterated  the competition.  But this doesn't mean there isn't someone larger who can't pry herself off the sofa, hoist 
[00:47:30]  her barely-breathing blubbery body up to our studios, and limp away with the grand prize.  Remember, the heaviest girl at the end of the contest gets $10 for every memory-repressing,  artery-clogging pound on her body.  So if you spend more time upholstering your flesh with cupcakes than you do looking in a  mirror, sign up for the Opie and Anthony Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  Details on opieandanthony.com.  Sponsored by H57 Hootia. 
[00:48:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  You are checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up?  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Fatty Pig Fatty, brought to you by H57 Hootia.  Lose weight for free at H57.com.  Good news, if you weren't listening yesterday, we got a new leader in the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  Yes, we do.  Pretty much all of us were pretty scared of Honey from Binghamton. 
[00:48:30]  She made the trip down, and she weighed in at what?  505.8.  505.8 pounds.  Yes.  We'll call it 505 pounds.  She is the current leader in the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  We're paying $10 a pound, so that's $5,050.  Yep.  And $1,000 for, what was the guy's name?  Big fan of the show.  Bob, I think?  Yeah, I got the mustache.  He gets $1,000 finder's fee for bringing Honey into the studio. 
[00:49:00]  He looked like a fat Hitler.  Supposedly, we got two more girls that are going to be coming down next week.  That'd be nice.  And supposedly, they're much heavier than 500 pounds, so we'll see what happens.  Won't they have to be down Monday or Tuesday?  We're off Wednesday, and I think...  Oh, wait a minute.  Contest ends?  Wait, Tuesday is our Halloween party at the Hard Rock Cafe, so we're not...  Are we doing a show Tuesday morning?  Yes.  We are.  Wednesday, we're off.  Oh. 
[00:49:30]  We're doing two shows Tuesday, right?  Is that how it's...  All right, whatever.  So Tuesday is the last day of the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest, a week from today.  There you go.  Okay.  By the way, I was checking out opianthony.com for the latest videos and pictures of Honey,  the new leader in the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest, and Steve, it says that she weighs 55 pounds.  55 pounds.  Yeah, what happened?  When I saw it, it said, Honey, current leader of the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest, she weighs  55 pounds.  That's an important zero to leave out.  How ironic. 
[00:50:00]  You missed a zero, and you are one.  Thank you, sweetie.  And it got me to thinking that we should continue the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest, and we go the  other way with it.  The complete other direction.  And we just try to find the lightest girl listening to the opianthony show.  The lightest girl.  The lightest girl.  The slenderest girl.  Who's with me?  Who's with me?  Yeah.  I'm completely with you.  We want your fingers to smell like stomach bile if you get my drift.  All throat liquid knuckles. 
[00:50:30]  That slime on the back of your hands.  By the way, we're not kidding, because I know they love selling everything on this show.  Yep.  We want to continue the contest after Halloween, and we want to go the other way.  Other direction with it.  Got to be, what, 18 years or older?  Of course.  And we want to see who the lightest girl is listening to the opianthony show.  The lightest one.  Yes.  Before we run this contest, can I get a couple of those things you play a xylophone with?  I have an idea.  What are they called?  What are those?  Not sticks.  Sticks. 
[00:51:00]  They're called sticks with wood circles on them.  They've got little puffy things at the end sometimes.  Yeah, they're wood circle sticks.  All right, I've got to communicate.  Okay, winner to be announced on Tuesday morning.  H57 will present prize during the CBS portion of the show.  Nice.  All right, very, very good.  So, ladies, if you're out there, you've got to beat 505 pounds.  Current leader, Honey, from Binghamton, New York.  The contest is great, isn't it?  It's going well.  Yes.  H57's a weight loss thing, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, why do people take that?  Like, after they win the contest, why don't they give them some H57? 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  Take it.  Well, it'll be up to the winner.  Some of these girls want to be fat.  They want to be fat.  Yeah.  They don't want to be bothered.  Didn't look like Honey was going to be trying that hard to drop any pounds anytime soon.  She was sweating just standing there.  Yeah.  She dabbed herself with a towel just standing there.  It was really intimidating, man.  I don't know what it was.  I don't know.  Because I know she couldn't catch me.  I know what it is.  What?  She could get you.  No.  She'd be able to get you.  No.  You know how good she is at cutting the room in half?  Like Foreman. 
[00:52:00]  He had good footwork for a big man.  That's it.  The same way.  She just turns left and the room is cut in half.  You have nowhere to go.  Well, moving on.  By the way, we got Ryan Stark coming in in a few minutes here.  By the way, with Honey, you better get in the bathroom first in the morning.  You don't want to follow her.  I don't know.  It's not like rotted meat.  It's a weird news day.  It's a really weird news day.  Yeah.  You want to talk about Helena?  Oh.  Hey, man.  People are out there.  They got causes.  They got some important causes. 
[00:52:30]  They're getting things done for you and I.  Well, Helena Stone, formerly Henry McGinnis.  Sorry.  A little distracted.  What happened?  That completely naked girl in the apartment.  But she's a slob.  But we still look every morning.  Now she's standing right in front of the window, completely naked.  She is on a scale, I think.  Now she's turned around.  She's walking completely naked.  Where'd she go?  She went to the edge of the window. 
[00:53:00]  To the left.  Can you still see her?  Oh, there she goes.  There she goes.  Now she's turned her back into the bathroom.  She goes into the bathroom a little bit.  She doesn't look like she's very well clothed.  You see that?  Oh, she looks like she's very au naturel.  But she lost some weight.  She's on the bicycle, the stationary bike every morning.  And then she does.  Oh, she's walking around naked brushing her teeth.  I got something she can brush them with.  Sure you do, Mr. Norton.  She looks like she shaves with miracle grow. 
[00:53:30]  I think she's getting braver.  Because when we first started up here at Free FM in New York City, about five, actually we're  almost up to six months.  She was a lot chubbier, wasn't she, Ann?  Yeah, I think...  That bike is paying off for her.  That bike must have been new.  Here she comes again.  Get out of the way.  Do you think she likes being looked at naked?  She has to.  She has to.  Why would she be...  There's no shades.  There's no curtains.  It's the only lit up window in the whole building.  Facing this building that has a ton of windows.  It's still dark out enough where it's really obvious. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  And you can see perfectly clearly into her apartment.  And yeah, she's facing a building that is a complete glass building.  So there are offices in here and people are working.  So I think she's on to it.  You've got to be completely aware.  There she goes.  If you live in Manhattan, you're completely aware that people are peeking into other windows.  You just know.  You're just walking around.  You walk around Manhattan and you look up, you'll see a ton of telescopes. 
[00:54:30]  They're not...  A lot of astronomers.  They're not astronomers.  Next time you're walking around New York, seriously, look up a little bit.  Some of those outdoor spaces and stuff, they all have telescopes.  Well, you've seen my apartment.  I have like a windows.  I'm kind of surrounded by windows.  And I was...  For the first six months I lived there, I had no shades.  And you know what I do on the computer, and I know people had to look in and see it.  I know they had to.  I just got to a point where I didn't care.  Yeah.  I was not going to not do it.  Yeah, but how she walks around...  So you're just walking around.  Yeah.  How she walks around, she's not like running across a room real fast. 
[00:55:00]  She knows exactly what she's doing.  No, she's just walking around.  And hopefully she's listening to the show.  We say bravo.  Amen.  The exercise bike is paying off.  It certainly is.  She does the exercise bike, then she gets off the exercise bike and does a headstand against  the wall for ten minutes.  Headstands are supposed to be amazing for you.  Headstands are supposed to do something with your blood that makes you so much healthier.  It could give you a headache.  Oh, I know, and from your lips to God's ears.  And then she goes into the bathroom, showers, I guess, and then comes out and brushes her 
[00:55:30]  teeth.  Pukes.  Brushes her teeth.  Yeah, well...  She could have started working out with a razor and some shaving cream with one foot  propped up on the tub.  And she's alone every morning.  Yeah.  She doesn't have a guai.  She has no guai in her life.  No guai.  All right.  Weird day in the news today.  That's why a lot of these strange stories.  We got the sex offender story still.  And we got Helena Stone, formerly Henry McGinnis.  Henry.  Stayed on to her ground yesterday. 
[00:56:00]  They got a great picture in the paper.  What's the matter?  He didn't want to go with Henrietta?  She looks like Chief J. Strongbow.  I said, this mess should be on the side of a highway crying with garbage at his feet.  Well, Helena, formerly Henry, stands her ground yesterday outside Grand Central Terminal's  ladies' room.  That's right.  Ladies' room.  Which can now be used by transgender men.  Get me a dress.  It can, huh?  Get me a dress. 
[00:56:30]  I want to test this out.  There you go.  Get me a dress.  Transgender men free to use all of MTA's loos.  Loo's.  The Loo.  Why are they calling it the Loo?  Because it's the Post.  And they try to English up the Post because it's owned by Murdoch.  It's the only reason.  Is he British?  Yeah.  Why don't the politicians go after this?  A lot of our listeners.  Or he's Aussie or something. 
[00:57:00]  A lot of our listeners.  What is he?  Australian.  Same thing.  Why don't the politicians go after this?  Yeah.  A lot of our listeners have hot piece of ass young daughters out there and they need to  use the ladies' room and then you got these freaks.  They're freaks.  Scary man in a dress.  Well, now let's not rush to conclusions.  And I wouldn't call you a freak if you changed your sex and you actually look like the sex  you changed into.  Then I'd be like, all right, whatever you're into.  Whatever, dude. 
[00:57:30]  Whatever, dude.  I mean, but.  Whatever, dude.  But I mean, what is this proving?  Totonka.  Totonka.  That is just a disaster.  The headline reads, girls' room, his too.  The line for the girls' room just got longer.  Get it?  God.  Men who live as women can now legally use women's restrooms in New York's transit system under 
[00:58:00]  an unprecedented deal revealed yesterday.  Thank God we got this done.  Yeah.  Thank God.  You're not women.  This is important.  You're not women.  Doesn't matter what you turn inside out.  You're still a man.  Someone's had the operation.  I don't mind them using the ladies' room.  I think this guy's had the operation.  All right.  Then I got no problem.  There's actually a group that filed a complaint against the MTEA on behalf of a 70-year-old  telephone repair technician.  We've been following Henry for a while, by the way, who was arrested for using the women's 
[00:58:30]  room at Grand Central Terminal.  But is Henry just a guy who dresses and lives as a woman, or has he had surgery?  There's a big difference to me.  I think Hank has had the surgery.  All right.  He says he's a 24-hour woman.  Wait.  Transgender people.  That would mean post-operative?  I don't know.  No, I don't think.  Because transvestite is.  What is different?  Transgender, I don't think, committed to the chop.  No, I think transvestite.  No, transgender is the same thing as transsexual, I think. 
[00:59:00]  I think, too.  Transvestite is just a guy who likes to dress like women.  But I don't think transvestites have to be into men sexually.  They can be into women sexually.  No, transvestite can cover a guy who just likes wearing panties and doing that.  Or the over-the-top drag queens are also considered transvestite.  Well, Henry explains it right here.  I'm a 24-hour woman.  I just feel like a woman, and I like to wear women's clothes.  He's not had surgery.  I like to wear women's clothing.  What's going to stop a guy from putting on women's clothes and hanging out in the ladies' room and being a creep? 
[00:59:30]  Nothing now.  Nothing now.  And poor Gloria.  Put on some little boy shorts and walk into the bathroom.  Hot shorts.  Try to tuck.  Poor Gloria.  I would not like that, said Gloria David, a retiree from Connecticut.  I have nothing against gay men or drag queens, but they can use the men's room.  I just don't want to go to the bathroom next to a man.  How about if you make that decision in your life and that's what you want to do? 
[01:00:00]  There are going to be embarrassing moments.  You have to go into the men's room.  I know it's awkward, but what's more important, your right to not be embarrassed or women's right to use the bathroom without a possible guy standing in there?  Yeah.  God almighty.  The human rights groups are so out of touch with what's going to happen.  Yep.  This guy says it all.  I mean, a rider, I guess.  They interviewed people.  One rider feared predators.  It's actually a woman.  Predator.  One rider feared predators might dress as women and lurk in a women's room. 
[01:00:30]  First woman.  Come on.  Do it.  After the first woman is raped or assaulted by some guy in a dress, I guarantee you that this is going to be called into a task.  And then the tranny group will protest.  Looking like Sylvester Stallone.  And Nighthawk.  I just said called into task.  How old am I?  Called to task.  That was believable.  Just look at the shoulders, you silly goose.  They're huge.  Oh, at the end when he was a lady, but it was Sly.  Yeah.  He's good.  Yeah, exactly.  So, that's good news for you, you far rakes. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, anybody that's decided to lop anything off, salute.  It's your day.  Yeah, once you've lopped something off to me, you can use the restroom.  Yeah.  Yeah, if you chop, if you have to sit, that's the bathroom for you.  If you're able to stand, well, then you have a decision to make.  Go before you leave the house.  And you should be tested.  There should be a test outside the ladies' room.  Absolutely.  Really?  The ladies' room.  Yeah, I want to make sure you have to sit down.  Got to take a look-see?  Have somebody to take a look-see? 
[01:01:30]  The old peek-a-boo, as we call it.  The old peek-a-boo.  You, sir, can use the men's room.  You have to drop those panties and give the old peek-a-boo.  That's right.  Not the oopsie, the old peek-a-boo.  Make sure no one's tucking, though.  Oh, good.  That's why you got to go for the test.  So, someone's got to actually reach and pull.  And you just grab.  Just give a little juggle.  Like you would test a cow udder for milk.  Just jiggle.  Blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:02:00]  All right.  You left.  You go right, you trickster.  We're on to you, sir.  You got me, daddy.  Well, another crazy story.  It's just...  What story is this?  Foul fly ball.  Oh, okay.  Yankee plane ornament.  This Santa Claus Yankee plane Christmas ornament is still on sale despite the death of pitcher  Corey Lytle, whose small aircraft crashed into an Upper East Side apartment building. 
[01:02:30]  What does one have?  They make it sound like Corey Lytle crashed his plane, which was a very unfortunate incident  here in New York City.  And then they decided to make a Yankee plane with Santa driving.  Yeah.  Or flying, I should say.  It was completely disconnected.  Of course.  Why shouldn't they make this?  I mean, he had an accident.  He died.  Okay.  What if it was a car?  What if Corey Lytle was killed in a car?  Should there not be any matchbox cars with Yankee insignias on them? 
[01:03:00]  You jackasses.  Well, this lawyer in this story is just a dope.  Of course he is.  Talk about bad timing.  A new Yankee Christmas ornament sanctioned by Major League Baseball.  Uh-oh.  And bearing the team's official logo features a beaming Santa waving as he pilots a plane.  My reaction at first was, I don't believe it, said Midtown lawyer Dennis Guerin.  Really?  Who yesterday received glossy literature touting the Yankees' victory plane.  A limited edition annual holiday treasure in the mail. 
[01:03:30]  Well, Guerin shuddered as he recalled the horrific event that unfolded October 11th.  Can I be Guerin?  Yeah.  There's a plane running.  Ah!  Oh!  Oh!  October 11th!  You shuddered.  Guerin said he and his wife were shocked and dismayed.  That was October 10th, wasn't it?  Again, when they opened the mailing featuring the Yankee Santa in a plane.  He said the plane appears to be going into a Christmas tree.  Can you just be dismayed?  What?  He's a dope.  The plane appears to be...  Let me see that picture.  Well, because it's a catalog. 
[01:04:00]  I'm sure with all sorts of stuff you can buy, right?  Ornaments, whatever.  I don't think he hit a Christmas tree.  He said the plane appears to be going into a Christmas tree.  No, it's hanging from a Christmas tree, you dope.  And Santa's a better pilot than Corey Lytle was.  Yeah.  He lands on roofs successfully.  That's right.  Every time, you've never heard of one Santa crash.  You certainly haven't.  There's been a few incidents, but they're covered up by the media, man.  Man, it's a conspiracy.  And it was October 11th.  I was wrong.  Sorry.  According to the advertisement, the 2006 annual Yankees ornament makes the ideal gift for 
[01:04:30]  every New York fan on your Christmas list.  Your team's spirit will soar with the plane on your tree, it says.  That's also awful.  We looked at it with our mouths open and said, how could this have happened?  It's very insensitive.  How could they say that with their mouths open?  Try it.  Two of them just talking like that in their house.  Mouths agape.  It was in production already, you idiot.  It's not connected.  It's ridiculous. 
[01:05:00]  I don't think it was intent.  All right.  At least he's admitting.  I don't think it was intentional, the season ticket holder added.  It's just a terrible mistake and terrible coincidence.  What a douchebag.  So what do you want?  What do you want them to do?  Do you think anyone really, really, how many people would have put that together?  I never would.  If I saw that ornament, I would think, oh.  I'd be like, hey, that's kind of cool.  Something different.  With a Santa Claus.  The only people that care are Lytle's family and friends.  And two apartment owners in that building.  That's right.  I like to be in the apartment over and take this ornament and just throw it at the window  and giggle. 
[01:05:30]  So, Merry Christmas.  And the Yankee officials aren't commenting because it has nothing to do with them.  No.  This actually was developed probably over a year ago.  It's just awful, said Pete Siegel.  George Costanza.  It's George Costanza's idea.  They're going to have this plane, and they're actually going to have a Yankee helicopter with 
[01:06:00]  Steinbrenner being thrown out of it like Omar and Scarface for the awful decisions he  makes with his pitching staff.  Randy Johnson is 60.  Oh, my God.  Season's over for the Yankees.  Oh, I'm so happy it is.  Go Tigers.  Bunch of douches.  It's almost sacrilegious about the incident, he said.  You're going to have a Yankee plane on your Christmas tree, he said.  Who's sanctioning this stuff?  Who do you think?  And Gurren, the lawyer, said he couldn't imagine anyone buying it either.  Well, I'm going to buy one. 
[01:06:30]  Watch.  Really?  I think they're going to sell out in Boston.  You don't think anyone's buying them?  Are you kidding me?  Not only are they going to be on trees, they're going to be lit on fire in Boston.  How do you like them apples?  They'll sell just fine.  What a killjoyed Dennis Gurren is.  These people have nothing better to do.  And dismayed?  Yeah, I was shocked, dismayed, I awed and upset.  And I shuddered with my mouth agape.  And I said all in one thing.  This guy really doesn't. 
[01:07:00]  How does he handle legal cases if this is how he reacts to a Christmas ornament?  The judge didn't side with me.  So I vomited on the floor and screamed racial epitaphs.  All with my mouth agape.  All with my mouth agape.  Yeah, could you imagine that?  Here are the pictures of the deceased here in this murder case.  Just shaking around the courtroom.  That's insensitive.  I'm suing you.  Dennis Gurren is a horse's ass. 
[01:07:30]  This is how the news is reporting it because they love this stuff.  Well, it seems like a good idea at the time, but due to the magic death of Yankee pitcher  Corey Lytle, the timing could not be any worse.  We were talking about a Yankee Christmas ornament that's down still.  The Yankee's playing.  Instead of wearing a Santa outfit like the ornament is.  The timing could be worse.  Yeah.  It could be the same day that he crashed.  It could have come out.  That's right.  He could have been in a plane that had pinstripes on it.  Yep.  And he could have been dressed, yes, like Santa Claus. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  The timing also could have been better.  It could have happened in Tampa when Cashman was signing certain contracts.  Wow.  Christmas ornament that's now on sale.  The Yankee's victory plane was designed more than a year ago.  Earlier this month, Lytle and his instructor pilot died when their plane slammed into a building  on the Upper East Side.  Yankee's officials have refused to comment.  Victory plane.  They should have put out the Hindenburg ornament.  Yeah.  Goddamn team.  You stink. 
[01:08:30]  Stupid.  It's like a prop plane, and Santa is almost as big as the plane, and he's waving, looking  to the left.  He's too big to fly that plane.  He's much too big.  I think him is sticking out of the plane.  Let me see the picture.  That would definitely affect the aerodynamics of that plane.  I don't think it would get off the ground.  Santa has a water head.  Yes.  Big water head.  The wings are too small for the plane.  There's no real engine.  It's just hollow.  Santa doesn't have any genitalia. 
[01:09:00]  Santa uses the ladies' robe.  Santa's a fat, tranny MTA worker.  Or Verizon worker, whatever company that was.  But he can use the MTA bathrooms.  Santa's alter ego is Santana.  Santa's a douche.  Santa stinks.  I really want to dress like a Santa and go on a killing spree and just spoil it for all 
[01:09:30]  the children.  Ruin it.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to Ken.  We got to make it fast.  I got three phone calls to do before we go to break.  Come on again.  I got to get Ryan Starr in here.  Ken, what's up?  Come on again.  All right, boys.  Hey, I've seen these ornaments for about 10, 15 years.  What happened?  Didn't Al Thurman Monson go out in a plane crash?  Yes, he did.  Yeah, but see, enough time went by, man.  It's all about time.  Canton, Ohio.  That's right.  Let's go to Carlos.  Carlos.  Yo.  Hey.  Yo.  Hey, Carlos.  I got a quick question about your new contest coming up. 
[01:10:00]  Okay.  You said the age requirement is going to be 18 and over.  Yes.  Why didn't you have a 70-pound midget walk in there?  We're just looking for the lightest person.  And this is a person.  Not even girls anymore.  It's guys and girls.  The lightest person listening to the Open Anthony Show.  I think we want to start up right after Halloween.  And we still want to call it Fatty Pig Fatty, by the way.  What if a midget comes in?  I say go for it, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, mini Pedro died the other day.  If midgets ruin this contest, if some midget comes in here and he's just an average midget 
[01:10:30]  and he wins because he's lighter than a skinny broad.  We're hoping some girl in anorexia wins, yes.  But midgets can be fun, too.  If they ruin the contest, they've ruined family photos.  They've ruined rides or Coney Island laws.  How could they not ruin this?  Might as well ruin this contest.  Spoilers of all that is good.  By the way, what's not mentioned in this story, and everyone's calling in, they make  those ornaments for every team out there.  Yeah, exactly.  Every team.  They should make them for a soccer team in 72.  We'll see. 
[01:11:00]  Where the little pieces eat each other up.  Yeah.  Nice.  Nice callback.  Holly, Maine, what's up?  Milk chocolate passengers that you could just eat at Christmas.  I just wanted to clarify between the whole transsexual, transvestite thing.  Yes.  Thank you.  We know the difference, but go.  Oh, well, if you know the difference, but...  Yeah.  Well, anyway, transsexual is, you know, the type that actually goes out and dresses up,  and they really believe in their mind, but a transgender was born that way. 
[01:11:30]  Like, it's kind of like a genetic thing.  Oh, see, I thought you were going to talk about the difference in pricing on Craigslist.  All right.  Thanks for nothing.  I don't know if you were supposed to learn either, so, like, we did a whole course about  this, and there's actually a mental, like, it's a mental thing.  They actually believe in their heads that they were born as a female if they're a male and  vice versa.  Where did you take a course on this?  What college was teaching this?  Nonsense.  It was actually a Catholic college in Maine.  Oh, God.  The 13th grade.  What were they saying at Catholic college?  One should be shot and one should be burned at the stake?  Yeah, right?  Yeah, tell me about it. 
[01:12:00]  All right.  I wanted to let you guys know Maine loves you.  I know I love you guys.  Oh, thank you.  What do you like about the show, Holly?  I think it's awesome.  Oh, no, she was intimate.  You know.  She was talking.  Thank you, Maine.  Someone from their cell phone.  You've got to write your names down if you're instant feedbacking from cell phones.  That will go great with the Bob O'Hita motorboat.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Oh, boy.  We're going down that road today.  That ornament.  All right.  Joe Peppato and Mule.  We've got to take a break, and we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony show featuring 
[01:12:30]  Lowell, Jimmy.  Oh!  Who's going to be on Letterman next week.  Yeah.  Jim Norton will be appearing on The Late Show with David Letterman, Wednesday, November  1st.  Check local listings for showtimes.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America. 
[01:13:00]  In studio, let's say hi to Ryan Starr.  What's up, Ryan?  How's it going, guys?  We had to get some radio done, so sorry that we made you wait a little bit.  So good.  But we have a lot of people listening right now, so this is prime time on the Opie and Anthony  show.  So good.  Hey, admit it to everybody once again.  We helped you with that.  You guys helped me.  On Rockstar, right?  I mean, you guys brought me back.  It was mainly due to your misunderstanding, I think.  Would it take 10, 15 minutes just to figure it out?  The whole cell phone thing had to vote for me, but man, it worked. 
[01:13:30]  You got like 10, 15 minutes, people just pounding the lines.  Well, the ONA Pest, they have a new project.  It's the Jerry Springer project.  Yeah.  Vote for Jerry.  Today's the day, right?  I think so.  You got to vote for Jerry today?  Yeah, I think today's the day.  We're trying to keep Jerry in that stupid Dances with the Stars, Dance with the Stars show.  You can do it.  You guys have the power.  You guys have the listeners.  Yeah, but he's so annoyed.  Like, you kind of wanted to come back in.  He doesn't want our help. 
[01:14:00]  He wants off the show.  His knees are bad.  He's complaining the whole time, and we just keep...  And that's a weird setup, because 50% of the vote is the judges.  And the judges hate him, obviously.  And the judges give him the lowest scores every week.  And yeah, the audience, they are our listeners and stuff, just keep pounding and pounding and  keeping him in there.  And he's so aggravated and annoyed.  He called us from the airport the other day, just bitching, just saying, stop, please.  No, really, it's not even funny anymore. 
[01:14:30]  Because he's, you know, he's taping his Jerry Springer show.  So now he has to fly from L.A. to Chicago, do his show for a while, and then go back to  L.A. to tape Dancing with the Stars.  So against his will, you're really keeping it up.  Well, he looks like a freak show now.  It was fun at first, but now he just looks silly on TV.  And that's why we're loving this.  I think we've got a tough week ahead of us, though.  I don't know.  It's going to be really tough to keep him going.  Every week is tough.  Who else is on the show?  We don't even watch the show.  We don't care less.  Oh, we don't watch it.  We don't care.  I couldn't tell you.  Yeah.  It's just a matter of making it happen.  I know that Broad had a...  This is what I know about the show. 
[01:15:00]  The Broad had to quit because her nanny's having an affair with her husband.  That's all I know.  And some guy from Saved by the Bell, right?  Or one of those shows.  Screech.  Not Screech.  Emmett Smith is in.  Screech is in another project.  Yeah, he's in the indie film circuit.  Yeah.  And Heather Mills is doing the electric slide next week.  But to the O&A pass, vote for Jerry, ABC.com.  I guess we've taken over the message board, and then the real fans of the show are pissed  off, and they're trying to fight the O&A pass, but they're losing. 
[01:15:30]  Good luck.  We've got all these little battles in cyberspace every day.  It's great.  There's no fighting the pest.  No, of course not.  But we've got a tough week ahead of us, so vote for Jerry.  Let's see if we can get him.  How do you fight with Conor's anchor or something like that?  It's just no way to do it.  One of those awful names.  Old gravy legs checking in, and you lose, sir.  So Ryan was telling us you're going to Malaysia.  I'm going to Malaysia, yeah.  I just came off a West Coast tour with this girl. 
[01:16:00]  She's 16 years old, really talented.  Her name's Cheyenne.  I was seeing her on TV.  She's beautiful.  She's on MTV.  I hopped on her tour.  You hopped on her?  Got on Cheyenne, and then toured a few weeks.  And yeah, now I'm here.  I'm doing a sold-out show tonight at the Valerie Ballroom in New York City.  And then I do some East Coast dates, get to Canada, and then I'm off to Malaysia.  We're going to wing on over to London and jam with the stones.  Pretty much.  It's up next, hopefully.  I mean, I'm going to Malaysia and Singapore, where the show Rockstar was so big that they're 
[01:16:30]  preparing me for just something so bizarre, like a Beatlemania, like security guards and  all this crazy stuff.  So it's going to be a good experience.  And then I come back here for Thanksgiving.  And they're starved for entertainment.  Nothing against you and Rockstar.  I mean, whatever, man.  But if they're following you around like one of the Beatles, they're just starved.  They need some sitcoms or something in that damn country.  No one goes there so damn far.  No one bothers.  So I'm excited.  They don't want to get blown up.  Seems to be a thing that goes on over there sometimes.  Doesn't Malaysia have the tallest building in the world? 
[01:17:00]  That's all I know about Malaysia, right?  Is that it?  Yeah, Nakatomi Plaza.  Two of them.  No, I haven't.  It's from Die Hard.  I think Malaysia has the two tallest buildings.  Every building reference I make.  You guys are so smarter than me.  Wait, Pai Yang?  Pai Yang it is.  Yeah, there you go.  Something like that.  Inside the two buildings, they're joined in the middle.  Connect the middle with a little bridge.  A little bridge.  A little bridge that you can cross over at 18 billion feet.  Looks like an age.  Yes.  No, it doesn't.  A very tall age.  Well, no, the building is...  The bridge is...  It's low.  The little thing with connecting is like the 30th and 40th floor, I think. 
[01:17:30]  I'm guessing.  I have no idea.  I assume there were a couple.  Look it up, Hawk, before you get slapped.  And they were very high up.  Just Google it.  We don't care.  I'm curious.  The fans want to know.  Ryan's from Long Island, from our town, Ant.  Our area, Ant.  That's right, yeah.  Huntington.  Huntington boy made good.  Made good.  I was 14 years old playing at the Roxy, where you guys remember?  Yeah, played there a few times.  Frank Cariola.  Frank Cariola with the big hair growing out of his ears.  Looks like two party favors in his ears.  His earmoss.  He would steal our money. 
[01:18:00]  We had to put people out there counting.  Oh, of course.  You didn't bring anyone tonight.  Yeah.  I didn't.  The place was packed, and they were all here for us.  Right.  What happened?  Well, we had a big guest list.  Oh, I did?  I had 300 people on the guest list?  Well, they drank a lot.  Oh, you shyster.  I feel sorry for you guys, you musicians.  You get screwed out there until you make it, right?  I mean, you know, well, I'll see.  I've never made a dime doing music.  You still haven't made any money?  I mean, now for the first time, people actually think I'm worth something when I come play their 
[01:18:30]  town, so that's exciting.  So, next up is I'm going to record a record.  I'm going to come home after Thanksgiving and get in the studio and do it the right way.  Well, what is Dark Horse about?  Dark Horse is awesome.  It was kind of like the show, when I was done, when I got kicked off the show, Mark Burnett,  who is amazing, you know, he's pretty much my hero now, he got me in the studio right  away, did a live album, not in the studio, in a live stage, and we did songs from the  show and also some original stuff to kind of make that bridge, that little tiny H bridge 
[01:19:00]  to see where we're going, you know, the show that I'm going to be a solo artist, I guess.  And that was, you know, kind of a moment, captured what I did on the show.  And I also have another album on my website, rstar.net, called Songs When They Have  an Elephant, which is just me on a piano, you know, just kind of a sketch album, it's  pretty great.  rstar.net, just the letter R, then S-T-A-R.  Exactly.  Simple lines intertwining.  It sounds good.  You know.  It's beautiful.  Do you want to play a song for us, Ryan?  It's called Lick My Love Pump. 
[01:19:30]  What do you want to play for us today?  I can play a song, you know, it's a rock and roll show now.  Yeah, yeah, you rock.  Do you want to play some rock and roll?  Oh, you rock.  Do you have anything by the fine young cannibals?  This is called Back of Your Car.  This was actually an original I got to play on the show, which was kind of exciting, and  it essentially was what you guys brought me back on the show to do, which was the encore.  So, I'll call Back of Your Car.  It's the perfect time of night to be losing your clothes now. 
[01:20:00]  If you carefully take them all, and I'll carefully show you how.  In a minute we'll be gone, so we might as well just hug.  Because the churches, they're all filled.  Empty prayers are out of luck. 
[01:20:30]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're not yourself, you're not yourself tonight.  Whoa, whoa, you got your life, now get yourself in mind.  Whoa, whoa, you won't be sad, but you won't be satisfied.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[01:21:00]  It's the perfect time of night to be losing your mind.  Now as the curtains finally fall, will you kindly take your bow?  So love our time, don't waste your life.  It's the perfect time of night to be losing your clothes. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, you're not yourself, you're not yourself tonight.  Oh, you got your life, now get yourself in mind.  Oh, you won't be sad, but you won't be satisfied.  Oh.  Oh, I'll wait for you in the back of your car. 
[01:22:00]  Let's find out who you really are.  I'll never change if you want me to.  You'll better change if I ask you.  So tell me, what is the matter with this?  They say it starts with just one kiss.  We're never gonna be here again.  Again.  Again. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Whoa.  Whoa, you lost yourself.  You lost yourself tonight.  Whoa.  Whoa, you got your life, now get yourself in mind.  Whoa.  Whoa, you won't be sad, but you won't be satisfied.  Yeah, that's all right. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, that's all right.  I'm just kidding, man.  Singing his ass off.  Ryan Starr from, what is it, Dark Horse, right?  And Back of Your Car, the song you did on Rockstar.  Actually amazing.  rstar.net.  Nice one, yeah.  Wow.  What do you think, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  Yeah, you can sing.  I don't know how the hell you sing at 7, yeah, whatever it is in the morning.  I'm on Malaysian time, trying to get used to it.  How's that it?  Did you try out for American Idol?  No, I did not. 
[01:23:30]  I did not.  You know, all my friends over years, I was in a rock band called Stage.  That was my thing from Long Island.  And we had, you know, success.  Madonna signed us to her record label a few years ago.  You ever meet her?  Yeah, I mean, she signed us.  She ever gave you a small black child?  She adopted the bass player, and that's why the band broke up.  So we toured the country, did that whole thing.  And then afterwards, I was doing my solo thing in New York City.  This was about two years ago.  I started doing, like, a solo thing and building an indie thing.  And everyone's like, you should just go on that show.  And it put something in the back of my head, and that was enough for me to say, well, this 
[01:24:00]  rock star show's kind of a little more credible.  You get to play rock and roll on TV with a real band.  And, you know, so it all worked out.  But, yeah, it was never the American Idol type.  You know, I don't think I could bring myself to that.  Yeah.  I'd rather be a starving artist.  Sitting there with Barry Manilow as he arranged as one of his songs for you.  You know, he gave it his own special twist.  Did he?  Did he give it a twist?  Barry Manilow, songs to sing while you drink the cocktail.  Hey, you're getting rave reviews there, Ryan.  Let's say hi to Adam in Jersey. 
[01:24:30]  Adam.  Hey, Ryan.  What's up, man?  What's up, Adam in Jersey?  Oh, and hey.  What up, Adam?  Hi.  Yo, Adam, I'm playing in Jersey on Thursday.  Really?  Where are you playing?  Starland.  Awesome, bro.  Listen, I just turned the radio on.  I'm on my way to school right now.  But, dude, you're fucking awesome.  You're awesome, bro.  You're awesome.  Thanks, dude.  All right.  He cursed, but Adam basically said you're awesome.  Where's Starland?  Not basically.  That was an exact quote.  You know, Starland's like 20 minutes outside of Manhattan. 
[01:25:00]  Okay.  And all the dates are on the website.  But, yeah, I'm doing some of these East Coast dates before I get out of here.  Very nice.  Can we get another one from you?  Yeah, man.  Can you hang through a commercial?  You want to do it before a commercial?  Do you guys got to go anywhere?  No, it's too commercial because it's a new song.  I'm going to get the lyrics out.  I wrote it a few days ago.  I tried it here on the air for the first time.  Are you nuts?  Pulling a Janine Garofalo.  You know, look, he's getting a stool and putting the words up on it.  It's a good song.  Come on.  All right.  I don't know.  We'll ask the listeners, I guess.  And then you've got to play something very familiar to end the whole thing, you know. 
[01:25:30]  Surely.  Which one do you like off this?  Off the Dark Horse album?  Yeah, yeah.  Geez, I don't even know.  I've never even listened to it.  What's your favorite cover that you like playing?  Actually, I've played Candy Shop by 50 Cent.  That's been good.  It shows.  But I guess on there, you know what?  I have no clue, dude.  I don't like playing covers.  I think I saw you play Clocks on Rockstar, right?  That was a good one.  That was pretty good.  In the air tonight, you got on here.  Iris.  Yeah.  Very nice by Goo Goo Dolls, right?  Yeah.  And Losing My Religion. 
[01:26:00]  Enjoy the Silence.  That's a great one.  Is that the Depeche Mode song?  Yeah, that's a great song.  I think you did that on Rockstar, too, right?  I did.  All right.  See, I watched the show.  And then Head Like a Hole.  I'll do Head Like a Hole.  How about that?  Yeah, that'd be actually really cool.  Nine Inch Nails.  Head Like a Hole is a great, great song.  All right, more with Ryan Starr in a bit.  You know what I heard yesterday?  It's called Osaka's Pop Star.  It's a band.  It did The Insects Will Get You.  Remember the song that the retarded children say?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:26:30]  You better watch out of The Insects Will Get You.  Yeah.  It's done.  I think it's Marky Ramones' band.  I heard a version of that.  I'm like, wait a minute.  What the hell is this?  This is The Insects Will Get You song.  Now we got to find that.  I know.  I want to take a listen to that.  Try to find it.  Congratulations, by the way.  I heard you do in the Hammerstein Ballroom on November 10th.  No, that would be Jimmy Norton.  Wait a minute, Jimmy.  Jimmy Norton is doing the Hammerstein Ballroom on November 10th.  I mixed him up.  Let me open for you.  Let me play one song and open for you.  Yeah, that would be great.  And then 1,800 chicks will file out. 
[01:27:00]  It'll be me and 200 fat guys.  Yeah, you guys got different audiences.  You haven't seen my fans.  Are they disasters?  No, they're not disasters.  No, it's all good.  They're all hot young youngsters.  You're the best fans.  The chicks love this guy.  I know.  Bumps me out.  It's the one virus spreading across America.  Hey, what's up?  It's Louis Tuchel's Santana.  Shut up!  Tourette's Day is coming to the Opie and Anthony Show, which is to say that we've discovered  a new excuse to point and laugh at people who are different.

It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Dad told you he'd be back, fam.  The show's back!  The show's back! 
[01:28:30]  The show's back!  The show's back!  Don't have to worry.  You can hear it inside.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ryan Starr in studio today.  Hello.  He's going to play another song or two for us.  I've got to get my belt back.  Who's back there?  You came in with your pants half on.  I've got to take a leak.  Talking about Long Island, and I'm like, wait, it's a break.  I've got to go to the bathroom.  At the end of a break.  I know.  I finally realized, wait a minute, we're going to be back on the radio. 
[01:29:00]  All right, we've got another cute story to get to.  Then we're going to get some more music out of Ryan Starr.  Yeah, it's just a weird news day today.  We've got one of these sex offender stories.  Yeah.  We love the sex offender stories.  There's so many of them.  Listen to what they're doing on Long Island.  Well, imagine finding out that 27 sex offenders lived in your neighborhood.  That's what the people of Hempstead discovered, along with other neighborhoods on the south shore of Long Island.  And many are finding out for the first time. 
[01:29:30]  Sex offenders dumped in shelters like this one in Hempstead.  Residents had choice words for the agency responsible.  They've got to live somewhere.  I mean, what town's going to be the one town that accepts this with open arms?  No one.  East Hampton.  No one.  He's responsible.  Shame on you.  It's, okay, so far Hempstead?  Huh?  So far Hempstead?  So far Hempstead, yeah. 
[01:30:00]  Didn't we do a story where they were in Mastic?  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Seeing a trend.  Well, they said poor towns all over the south shore of Long Island.  We'll see if the reports have been done differently.  Imagine you're a sex offender and you find out all your neighbors are ****.  Choice words for the agency responsible.  Shame on you.  Because you're deteriorating actually lives by the hundreds in these urban areas.  Newsday reports the largest. 
[01:30:30]  Wait, deteriorating?  They're deteriorating?  Wow.  What are they going to do next?  Go look at the fall foliage?  That's a common mistake, though.  Foliage and foliage.  Yes, but people under the age of seven frequently say that.  People who used to carry guns professionally never do.  Deterating.  Hundreds in these urban areas.  Newsday reports the largest clusters of sex offenders are concentrated in low-income areas of Long Island's south shore.  We see the existing Freeport, Roosevelt, Hempstead, Uniondale, all areas of middle to lower-income areas. 
[01:31:00]  Middle.  These offenders are level two and three, those most likely to strike again.  They're placed in neighborhoods with little political power.  It's unfair, and it's not put in neighborhoods where they are more affluent.  Another problem in these neighborhoods, rents are cheaper, and landlords are more willing to...  Of course.  What do you want them to do?  What do you want to put them on Park Avenue and have them pay $3,800 a month?  $3,800 a month on Park Ave?  I don't know.  I don't live there. 
[01:31:30]  Maybe for a closet.  $10,000.  Yeah.  Start at $10,000.  What about the really rich sex offenders, though?  That's a good point.  They probably pick up their own digs somewhere.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're in Thailand or something.  Yeah.  Out of the country.  I think people should be forced in low-income neighborhoods to have sex offenders living  in their kid's room and chipping in for the rent.  Put it this way.  The sex offender is going to be scared to go out.  I think they've got a strategy here. 
[01:32:00]  What do you want?  Do you want them in nice, affluent parts of Long Island?  It ain't going to happen.  Nope.  This is all based on what you pay your taxes for.  If your tax bill is really, really low, your services and who lives in your neighborhood  is going to be a little off.  If your taxes are really high, you're paying to not have a bad element in your neighborhood  and to have all of your services working well. 
[01:32:30]  That's just the way this country works.  Who's surprised by this?  You're actually safer, though, when you live near them.  I lived next to a rapist for a few summers.  Sexy now.  Yeah, and it was then the law came out.  You had to tell your neighbors.  Hello.  Statistically, you're a lot safer living right next door to a sex offender than...  Yeah, it's kind of hard to rape someone and run next door.  Yeah.  He's on the lam.  There he goes.  Next door.  Lights on.  Let's get him.  That is stupid. 
[01:33:00]  Did you tease him a little?  Did he rape girls or guys?  No, I remember one day, though, he came up to me.  It was my family.  It was like one of those, like a summer thing in Montauk that we went out to.  And we're out on the beach.  And I remember one day, my sister, before we knew this, he asked my sister if she wanted  to take a boat ride with him.  He had a boat ride.  Oh, that's good.  And then two days later.  The old Peterson cruise.  We never went back.  The lost son.  Or maybe the guy's just into boating.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, you have many different hobbies.  Boating and rape.  Yeah, but it doesn't mean he's going to take your sister on a boat trip to rape her. 
[01:33:30]  Maybe he just wants to go out and enjoy the water.  I mean, we did live next door, so I'm sure it was fine.  Maybe he fancies himself a young Alan Hale.  Another problem in these neighborhoods, rents are cheaper, and landlords are more willing  to take on sex offenders as tenants.  And what about notifying people?  Right now, police only do it once when the sex offenders move in.  So if you move in after the time they do a notification, which is quite possibly, you  know, very likely, then chances are you're not going to be notified. 
[01:34:00]  Well, the Department of Social Services said, how often do they expect you to be notified?  Every 20 minutes you get a phone call?  Did we mention it?  Yes, I get it.  Yes, yes, we know.  And he didn't, he didn't, we know, I heard.  Thank you.  You should know when your tax bill comes and it's easy to pay.  That's when you know that your whole neighborhood is full of people that might cause you some  type of harm.  And someone has to stick up for the sex offenders.  These guys got to be scared assless living in these neighborhoods. 
[01:34:30]  I don't stop at lights in these neighborhoods.  Right.  I keep going.  You think these sex offenders are walking out and walking the streets whistling a happy  tune?  No.  And everybody knows why you're living there.  I feel like all of a sudden you're a middle-aged white guy with a mustache and a bad gut.  Everybody knows why you're in that neighborhood.  You know, and you smell like Similac.  Old baby powder breath.  Let's go to Debo from Patterson, New Jersey.  All excited about Halloween.  Yeah.  Debo. 
[01:35:00]  Hey, what's going on?  In front of your pants goes as a M.A.S.H.  You guys talk about how scared you are about being around black folks and stuff like that.  Did we say that?  No, it's terrifying.  South Jersey is full of redneck white boys that are pouring in dirt.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  And they don't pay their tax.  They don't pay taxes.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Are they desirable?  No.  I said undesirables.  I didn't mention any.  We don't know what you mean.  We don't know what you mean. 
[01:35:30]  What do you mean?  I said undesirables.  It goes for white trash, too, my friend.  Oh, now it goes to white trash.  But every other joke, every morning, I get on.  Oh, my God, Debo.  Talk about black folks, man.  I mean, come on, man.  You're really?  If it was funny, I'd laugh.  It's not always funny.  Sometimes it's just rude.  Why don't you call a hip-hop station and complain or call WLIB if it existed anymore and complain  and all they do is tell the white people.  I was pissed off when they got Star off the radio because Star at least brought it to the  forefront. 
[01:36:00]  I mean, at least he brought the N-word to the forefront.  And he said, look, why are we exploiting this word?  You know what I'm saying?  It's retarded.  But, I mean, come on.  You guys are funnier than that, man.  Every other joke doesn't.  Do you understand?  Every other joke is a black...  You're not being honest, Debo.  And you're also a little too used to white radio shows that don't do any black jokes,  dude.  That's right.  You're used to people being PC.  You guys did.  There was nothing in Anthony's rant there or whatever where he said he was talking about  black people.  Nothing.  You heard black people.  You heard black people. 
[01:36:30]  We all thought it, but you heard it.  I say lower tax areas.  Yeah.  And undesirables.  I live in a higher tax area.  Okay.  Well, good for you.  See?  Then it has nothing to do with you.  Then it has nothing to do with you.  How about the white trash you were talking about?  Would you feel safe going there alone at night?  Yeah.  I ain't scared of them because I don't crap on them.  I mean, why would I be scared of them?  Oh, so wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  So any, you're saying that if I turn that around, any white person, as long as he doesn't crap  on black people, can go into low income, high crime areas and not worry because he doesn't 
[01:37:00]  crap on black people?  No, no.  Because of the situation which you guys perpetuate.  I mean, everything.  We perpetuate it.  We perpetuate it.  Stop.  That's it.  All right.  This might not be the radio show.  Don't take any responsibility or accountability for anyone's actions.  And I don't mean anyone of any color.  I'm just talking about people in general.  Just don't take any responsibility for any of your actions.  It's always someone else's fault.  How are we perpetuating it?  I'm not saying any, I'm not speaking for the black race. 
[01:37:30]  I'm just speaking for myself personally.  How are we perpetuating it?  Huh?  How are we perpetuating a situation?  I mean, even when you have Patrice O'Neill on the radio, he's an N-word every five seconds.  So what?  He's like a personal porch monkey.  You know what I mean?  Patrice?  Look at the hip.  The angle he takes, the porch monkey, the fact he, are you kidding me?  All he talks about is how black people are mistreated.  What are you talking about?  And he's probably one of the most educated people as far as.  Five and six thousand times.  Yeah, so?  And so do 8,000 hip-hop guys.  Is there a problem? 
[01:38:00]  Why?  Because it's on this show?  Can I say the word again?  Any on a radio?  Yes.  What, me?  Of course.  I don't hear him saying that.  Holy jeez, then you're not listening to the show.  How many times have we got one of some of these, one of these gavones from Brooklyn calls up  and I call him a stupid guinea.  Yeah, but guinea doesn't mean you don't get a job.  Guinea doesn't mean, okay, well.  Oh, stop it.  So empower the words.  Empower the words some more.  Empower the words some more.  What's worse, dude?  Go ahead. 
[01:38:30]  Why don't you worry about what hip-hop is doing, dude?  Yeah, how about hip-hop?  I'm just off about that, too.  Why doesn't hip-hop, why don't you call a hip-hop station and bash them?  What's that?  I don't listen to them.  One star left the radio.  Well, why don't you pick up the flag and start a cause against hip-hop songs using that word.  I'm too busy out here working.  I gotta shop, man.  Then why are you calling, why do you worry about what this show is doing when we're doing no damage?  We're just doing dumb jokes.  You guys are doing damage because it's, honestly, because it's annoying. 
[01:39:00]  Okay, well then don't, then don't lie.  Then don't lie.  You say we're perpetuating a situation.  We have no influence in the black community.  Hip-hop has a big influence in the black community.  They are perpetuating a situation.  If you think that you don't have an influence, now, I'm not trying to crap on you guys, not like that,  but before you guys were just in the afternoons, and Howard Stern was in the morning, right,  and the OJ trial, I was in construction, okay?  Now, Howard Stern personally had an effect on the black community. 
[01:39:30]  Why?  Because every five phone calls were, oh, yeah, I just laid off three of my ends.  You know what I'm saying?  Oh, my God.  Yes.  He had, wait, wait.  He had an effect.  It wasn't, it wasn't the racial division that the trial caused.  Are you a mad person?  You're insane, Debo.  I'm like you, Anthony.  I'm like you.  Why don't you call it the conversation, dude?  Stop using the word perpetuate.  Sicilian.  Until you really, like, understand what that means.  Really. 
[01:40:00]  Seriously.  Excuse me, little Jimmy.  Dude, we don't perpetuate a situation.  We do jokes about what is already there.  Hip-hop.  I'm using the word perpetuate.  If I got another one, not to nitpick, but I mean.  What white guy did you wrong?  Yeah.  That's the word you used.  Which one?  I mean, how many of you got to?  Well, that's not our problem.  Some white guy did you wrong.  What can I tell you?  So you hear things that are just not there.  Some white guy.  No.  Let's say all white guys.  All white guys.  All right.  And then we'll say all black guys are.  That's right.  Look at the news.  Look at the news. 
[01:40:30]  And it's all black people with all the crime in the city.  And then you'll turn around and say, that's just how the news portrays it.  And we'll, you know, this could go back and forth.  We're doomed as a nation.  Why can't we just all accept that, that we're never, ever, ever going to get along?  Why can't we just accept that?  Here we go.  We don't want to get along.  We'll agree to disagree.  And someday in the future, kill each other.  We don't want to get along.  We're being forced to get along.  Take some more calls on this subject.  And see if I'm wrong.  No, no.  Because it's foreign radio, dude.  You're one guy.  We don't care if we annoy you. 
[01:41:00]  You're one guy.  Don't listen to the show.  The show's not for you.  We make fun of pretty much everyone and everything.  You have to listen to what other people are listening to.  I mean, I'll tell you how it's true.  Put Velcro on the ceiling.  Three if you slice him thin enough.  Wet his lips and stick him to the wall.  An empty boat.  That'd be a good start.  It's really not funny.  It's hilarious.  Oh, trust me.  People are laughing in Debo.  Listen to another show.  If Star didn't get fired, you guys wouldn't have a job. 
[01:41:30]  But he did.  The bottom line is, he did.  And you guys were ronky for it.  Wait, what?  Do we don't carry the way of it?  Wait, what did he just say?  He thinks that he's just...  He should have started and get fired.  We wouldn't have a job.  What?  That's idiotic.  Are you crazy?  What are you talking about?  No, I'm not.  Yes, you are.  Dude, we...  Some more calls on the subject.  Some more calls.  Keep them on.  No one cares about Star.  He got fired.  We didn't think he should have been, but he did.  Too bad.  We wouldn't have a job if Star didn't get fired.  Why don't you follow our careers?  Why don't you go Google our names and you'll see that we had... 
[01:42:00]  I want to hear his logic on that one.  We had a fine career before Star didn't.  What's your logic, bro?  Dude, what's your logic on those?  If Star didn't get fired, we wouldn't have a job?  Besides the fact of what he said about DJ Envy's kid.  Go ahead.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  I mean, come on.  Go ahead.  Go.  Wait, wait.  How?  You said we wouldn't have a job if he didn't get fired.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  You wouldn't have...  First of all, your ratings have dropped.  They have not.  They're going up, people.  Oh, my God.  Are you dumb.  We've been on for six months, and they've gone up every time.  Ah, okay.  That's one. 
[01:42:30]  Where do you get your...  Delusional.  Where do you get your info?  Delusional.  That was delusional.  Where did you get the...  Time for the old Blackburn.  Where did you get your ratings info?  Okay.  Well, okay.  Why don't you answer one...  Answer the fucking question.  Why don't you answer one question?  Why don't you answer one question that is presented to you?  From the news media.  You know who you are?  You're uppity.  You're uppity.  Why don't you answer a question?  You're a reverse racist jackass.  You're a dumbass.  Answer a question.  You're a racist, Debo. 
[01:43:00]  A racist.  You're right.  And you're holding your own people down.  That's what you do.  It's people like you that hold your own people down.  Stop blaming Whitey.  Stop blaming Whitey.  You're racist.  You're a racist.  Don't blame me for what my grandpappy did to your people.  I had nothing to do with it.  You're the reason I still scream that word out my window when I'm driving home.  Enough, Debo.  Myself.  Dude, don't bellyache.  Debo, don't bellyache because you didn't deal.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Don't bellyache because you didn't deal with whatever white guy wronged you. 
[01:43:30]  Don't bellyache about it now.  You had your chance and you didn't do it.  So don't snivel about it now.  You're lying.  You're losing the argument and you're lying.  Everything we've asked you.  Okay, how are we working?  Only because Star was fired.  Oh, your ratings are dropping.  You didn't answer one question.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  I called because, first of all...  Oh, now the pot's calling the kettle an African-American. 
[01:44:00]  The word out of your mouth is a black joke.  That's so wrong.  Every word.  Oh, so what?  Every word.  So bad, turn on a guilty white radio show that's afraid to make fun of black people.  Right.  Watch MTV, Comedy Central, or VH1.  None of them will make fun of it.  Or turn on a militant black station and listen to them talk about Whitey and how...  By the way, Debo, I get my ratings from Arbitron, okay?  That's right.  New York.  We'll just go with New York.  12 plus.  Winter, 06, when David Lee Roth had this time slot, 1.2. 
[01:44:30]  Hold on.  Debo.  Spring, 06, 2.1.  Summer, 06, 2.6.  How about we go with the men, 18 to 49?  That's where we're supposed to succeed.  That's right, Debo.  Winter, 06, when David Lee Roth had this disaster, 2.5.  Spring, 06, 5.0.  Summer, 06, 6.4.  That's from Arbitron.  Where do you get your info, Debo?  That's right, Puster.  Where do you get your info?  We could have had you shot.  You guys are something else, man. 
[01:45:00]  No, you are.  I blame Lincoln.  That's right.  I blame Lincoln.  Not the president, but the car.  Right.  Damn Lincoln.  Buzz kill.  Debo.  If you don't like the show, don't listen, man.  That's it.  You're in your neighborhood, banging your women.  Go ahead.  Who cares?  See?  And you've got to come down to that.  Stop trying to find an Achilles.  You're trying to be street now?  Debo.  You're trying to be street now?  Debo.  That's what I'm saying.  Debo, go listen to Whoopi, man.  That's the type of show you need to listen to. 
[01:45:30]  Wake up with Whoopi.  When I said I was street, come on.  Come on, Anthony.  You lost what?  You're delusional.  That's what you're saying.  Yeah, yeah.  We don't feel like doing city for radio.  Sorry, Debo.  Put your legs on.  No.  I want white people to feel guilty when I call.  No one cares if you're upset.  Yeah.  I don't want you to feel guilty.  You picked the wrong show.  You picked the wrong show to get guilt out of us.  Don't listen, stupid.  It ain't going to happen.  You guys.  Call a militant black station and commiserate with them, and they'll go, yeah, my brother. 
[01:46:00]  I hear what you're saying, my brother.  Yes, my young soldier.  We were princes and kings.  Yeah, yeah.  Call another station.  Call another station that cares.  Or call the restaurant that I just invested in Cracker Barrel.  Shut up and let my friend laugh.  There you go.  That's what you should be listening to.  Here you go.  With Whoopi.  Shut your face.  Wake up.  With Whoopi.  You're a racist, Debo.  And a silly goose. 
[01:46:30]  You're a racist.  No, you're not.  At least I admit it.  You're a racist.  I think everyone is racist.  Of course they are.  I'm not racist.  Yes, you are.  Shut up.  Somewhere along the line, someone decided that you have to be white to be a racist.  Wrong.  Exactly.  Wrong.  You just have to be white to be in banking.  Everything else is open to everyone.  Every single person has racism in them and a little hypocrisy.  That's right.  Goodbye, Debo.  Thank you for nothing.  Thanks for the call.  Stop listening to this show. 
[01:47:00]  This one's not for you, man.  Go listen to Whoopi.  I didn't like the fact that he wouldn't listen to the ratings.  That's the only thing that bugged me about Debo.  He wouldn't listen to that and he wouldn't answer any questions.  Besides his name is awful.  Like, he'd call us out on something and then we'd ask him, you know, where did that come  from or anything and you wouldn't get an answer.  And to call Patrice a porch monkey, look, as much as nobody likes Patrice, to call him  like some sort of a sellout is just silly.  Well, that, you know something, that is what a lot of people in the black community do  with black guys that are friends with white people that hang out, like would be on this 
[01:47:30]  show as a regular guest.  He's got to be some kind of Uncle Tom or something.  And what do you, you know, your, your, your, your candidate of choice there, Obama, wait,  Obama, just wait what he's going to be called though, dude, because he's going to have to  assimilate.  But Debo's calling me a racist.  I'm all for Obama.  Yeah.  And they'll call him an Uncle Tom.  And to call Patrice that, I mean, how funny is he when he walks in here holding a tray with 
[01:48:00]  hors d'oeuvres and stuff on it?  I mean, who doesn't love him?  Wearing white spats.  Hey, uh, the, the rest of this clip, by the way, about the sex offenders and the poor.  Oh, we said poor neighborhoods, but Debo's, uh, you know, assuming we're talking about  black neighborhoods.  Is Hempstead a black neighborhood?  It's black.  Good point, Debo.  Good point.  Get him back on the phone.  He's right.  Stupid.  OJ trial.  Shut up.  Could you mention something else that's not relevant anymore?  Jesus. 
[01:48:30]  Police only do it once when the sex offenders move in.  So if you move in after the time they do a notification, which is quite possibly, you  know, very likely, then chances are you're not going to be notified.  Well, the Department of Social Services says there's only so much they can do given the  legal and financial constraints connected with sex offenders.  In Hempstead, Dick Brennan, Fox 5 News.  What did Jimmy say?  What do you want?  Them to call you every freaking day?  They got a system that think, uh, they think that works and that's what they go with.  Yeah.  Plus, you move into a neighborhood, as your neighbors bring over an apple pie, I'm sure they'll 
[01:49:00]  let you know about the guy next door.  Oh, of course.  By the way.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Have a little task.  Like, hang up little girl panties on your clothesline.  See if they survive the night.  Put a camera on them.  Yeah, put a night vision camera.  And if he starts to circle them like a fly would a pest strip.  And circle under it.  It's up to you to, you know, see what your neighbor's all about.  Set up little traps for them.  God, that guy bugged me.  Why?  It just, it, because it's, it's, it's that whole attitude. 
[01:49:30]  There's no, there's no accountability on anyone's part anymore.  And I mean anyone.  No one wants to take accountability for themselves anymore.  You spill a cup of, a cup of coffee in your lap because you're driving like an idiot.  You got to sue who you bought the coffee from.  There's like, no one's just an idiot anymore.  And, and, and I, I was thinking about this the other day.  You got to blame all the government interaction and, and regulations because what they're doing is making this country safer for stupid people. 
[01:50:00]  So they, they take away certain things and make, and take away things that used to be dangerous that you just knew to stay away from or not do or use, you know, putting seatbelts in cars, helmets on bikes, things like that would weed out stupid people.  Now we just got this huge influx of stupidity because the government is making, uh, the country, um, less dangerous.  Now the government wants to dump society.  1984.  Thank you.  Then again, lawyers are scumbags for suing everybody, but lawyers don't make the final decisions. 
[01:50:30]  Juries do, which is made up of, of dumb citizens.  Right.  So we kind of do it to ourselves.  Yeah, but that's what I'm saying.  Like the, the country's getting dumber.  It's just getting dumber and dumber.  And, uh, it goes along with the lack of any accountability.  And I, I, I'm disgusted on a daily basis.  Shut up.  Sorry.  I, I want to bring it back to the comedy.  Someone on their cell phone.  Guarantee they have the best candy on Long Island for Halloween.  Yeah.  Remember you would like, you know, the word would get out like, Hey dude, you got to go 
[01:51:00]  to whatever deer park.  They're, they're, they're handing out the best candy.  Giving away the full size Milky Ways.  That's how you figure out who the sex offenders in the neighborhood are, man.  Yeah.  The stuff they're giving out.  They set up a haunted house in their, uh, house.  You go in the front door and it's a full candy store.  Come on in and pick what you like.  One family's giving out granny Smith apples and the other, the other guy is giving out  cotton candy and repressed memories.  I'll give you a chin print and you're back.  30 years of therapy.  Let's go to Pete on Long Island. 
[01:51:30]  Pete.  Hey, how are you guys doing?  Good, Pete.  What's up?  Anthony.  Yeah.  My Sicilian paisan.  Listen, do me a favor.  Please tell Opie to stop saying Obama.  Obama.  Oh.  He's into Obama.  What's Barack Obama?  I'm saying it because it's annoying.  Oh, well that, well it's working.  Well, Opie, I've been with you since your BAB days.  Come on, please.  I can't effing take it anymore, right?  Obama.  What's wrong with Opie rooting for Barack Obama?  Yeah.  And for the people trying to figure it out, yes, I do things to be annoying. 
[01:52:00]  Yes.  All right.  That's one of my little duties on this show.  Thank you.  Well, mission accomplished.  All right.  Hey, Ryan Starr in the studio.  We got to get another song out of him.  I'm going into break here.  This is a new composition.  I'm hoping I don't misread the lyrics I just wrote.  Yeah.  It's called The House Next Door to Me.  It doesn't smell like that, doesn't it?  I'm going to give you a shot.  Oh, okay.  It's called Debo.  Debo's a racist.  Debo?  Debo?  What was that guy's name?  Oh, Debo.  Oh, okay.  Debo.  I mean, I'm, yeah.  Stupid man, like, Debo.  Debo.  And you're playing the Bowery Ballroom tonight at 10 o'clock. 
[01:52:30]  For tickets go to, isn't it sold out, though?  It's sold out.  Oh, I'm just, I'll announce it here.  It's probably a bad move, but there's a little place that I started out a year and a half ago  playing in front of five people.  And it's called Rockwood on Allen Street.  And I'm probably going to go over there after the show at, like, midnight, play a little  set, private set.  You're that famous?  Ooh.  Uh, no.  But it seems like you're that famous.  The place only holds 40 people, so I'm hoping you guys come.  And I think we're going to work it out where Ryan Starr plays a song or two at our Halloween  party a week of tonight.  Yeah, let's do it.  At the Hard Rock Cafe. 
[01:53:00]  Ticket info coming soon, I guess.  And we can announce.  All right, Ryan Starr, let's hear what you got.  It's called what?  This is called Somebody's Son.  All right.  Brand new.  Brand new.  I've got your picture.  I know your song.  I'll sing it to myself when they're dropping bombs.  I know you love me and I'll be strong. 
[01:53:30]  It's just so hard to fight when you know it's wrong.  Hey, hey, head of state, send me home.  Take that freight back where I'm from.  Wake me up.  I want to lie by your side.  I want to see you when I open, yeah.  My eyes under the same sun.  We're under the same sun. 
[01:54:00]  Under the same sun.  We're under the same sun.  Somebody's sun.  Somebody's sun.  The note you wrote.  I memorized.  I say it to myself when they light up the sky.  And all your pain.  And you'll be strong. 
[01:54:30]  We can only pray that it won't be long.  Hey, hey, head of state, send me home.  Take that freight back where I'm from.  Wake me up.  I want to lie by your side.  I want to see you when I open, yeah.  Oh, my eyes.  We're under the same sun.  We're under the same sun. 
[01:55:00]  Under the same sun.  We're under the same.  Somebody's sun.  Somebody's sun.  Somebody's sun.  Somebody's sun.  Oh, oh, oh.  Ryan Starr. 
[01:55:30]  Nice, man.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Where's the old band?  What's that?  Where are the other guys?  The other guys.  From Long Island.  I'm always curious about that.  When one guy breaks out and decides to do his own thing,  you leave your old band behind where you sweat it in someone's garage  and in their basement for years.  That's what it was, man.  We played our first show.  We were like 14 at CBGB's.  And, you know, my bass player does my website.  He does rstar.net right now.  So he's still a good guy.  And he's my best friend. 
[01:56:00]  You know, he does all my stuff.  And he's doing his own thing as a graphic designer.  Another guy moved to Florida to work at Starbucks and be happy.  You know, I mean, they're all happy.  That's the thing.  I'm the only miserable, you know.  You don't look miserable.  Trying to make it.  No, I'm not miserable.  I'd say Starbucks guy.  Look, I'm still.  You're trying to tell me Starbucks guy is happy.  Starbucks guy.  As he sees you on Rockstar.  As he sees you on Rockstar.  You know, I'm really happy making coffee for people.  I like to hope he's happy.  You're on Rockstar.  He's hitting a mochaccino to a fatty.  Right.  And he has to deal with, like, asses. 
[01:56:30]  There's not enough foam in this.  Not enough whipped cream.  I said dry cappuccino.  This is.  Feel this.  This isn't dry.  How do I become a barrister?  Where is it a barista?  I'm sure he's happy there, Ryan.  Who are you kidding?  They're happy in the real life.  He looks at his phone every day going, when is this guy calling me?  Let's get the band back together, man.  To get me out of this hellhole.  Oh, man.  You know it's not that easy.  You know it's not that easy.  I mean, look.  It sounds great, but, you know, just a week ago, I'm driving 22 hours from San Diego to 
[01:57:00]  Seattle, you know.  That's cool stuff, though, man.  It's great, but, you know, over time, you're just like, man, when's it going to get easier?  And I don't think it ever does.  It doesn't.  Look at you guys.  You're waking up at 4 in the morning and you're more successful than ever.  Well, the worst part of our day is getting up.  When that alarm goes off, I curse everybody I know.  How long does it take to get out of it?  And I bang my legs and my feet.  What?  Five hours.  How long does it take to get out of it?  I clear up at about 10.45 every morning.  Yeah.  I'm hilarious for 15 minutes.  The truth of the matter is, you're like, the second the mics go on, you're on, you're 
[01:57:30]  ready to roll.  The second we're done for the day, done for the day.  I mean, exhausted, tired, driving home, falling asleep at the wheel.  It's just done.  But when the mics are on, you know.  We're on.  You got to go.  That's right.  It doesn't matter.  Right.  You know how it is.  You hit the stage.  You got to be on.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it for me.  That's it.  But he's happy at Starbucks, huh?  I would hope so.  I'm sure he is.  You know, he was working at Starbucks while we were pursuing.  I mean, it's part of the reason the band had out of their minds. 
[01:58:00]  They have good benefits.  They were all working at Starbucks.  Starbucks broke up the band.  Yeah.  Ryan's having a threesome with Tommy Lee and a chick.  And he's going, would you care for a pastry with that?  They may say that the cinnamon muffins are delicious today.  I haven't had one.  I'm trying to watch my weight.  Yeah, Ryan.  They have nuts and I'm allergic.  Ourstar.net.  We still have lots of show to go.  We're going to have one more from Ryan Starr.  Are you going to do Head Like a Hole?  Head Like a Hole, yeah.  All right, well, cool.  He's going to play us out with Head Like a Hole in a few minutes. 
[01:58:30]  And I think Howie Mandel is calling to say hi in 10 minutes.  And what happened to John?  He's in Malaysia.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Well, why is he not on a microphone?  Roland.  Why the hell is Roland not on a microphone?  Right.  He's going to try to call back tomorrow because we had Howie calling at the same time.  So John's still rehearsing in Malaysia.  John Mayer.  John Mayer.  So what was it?  You know, go in there to play with him.  Like, we're doing some stuff out there together.  Are you?  That's it.  Yeah.  As the guy at Starbucks, you know. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, is he going somewhere?  He's happy about it.  I mean, he's going to make coffee.  Dubai, I'm sorry.  What's that?  He's in Dubai.  Who is?  John Mayer.  So what's he doing now?  Rehearsing for tonight's show.  What time is it there?  I don't know.  Dubai time?  It's Dubai time.  Wow.  That's Roland.  He's, he is what you say.  He chokes up on Mike.  Really?  He panicked.  He's in the middle of the night there.  Yeah.  All right.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  I can walk on my hands. 
[01:59:30]  I can fart and chew gum.  Hi, baby.  Over.  I can ride a unicycle.  I wear a bra and laced panties.  So your talent is being queer, Travis?  It's the Opie and Anthony Walkover Talent Show.  If you have a unique skill, talent, music group, or physical affliction, we want to exploit.  You can email steve at foundrymusic.com with your ideas, or you can just show up during  the walk to XM and start shucking and jiving.  Shucking and jiving?  Jesus, Danny.  I don't write this.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:00:00]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Ryan Starr in studio.  He's going to play us out with head like a hole in a few minutes here.  We got Howie calling in to say hi?  Hi, Howie.  Wow, just like one of the models.  Yeah, I'm trying.  There he is.  Howie Mandel from Deal or No Deal. 
[02:00:30]  Well, originally from Canada, and then I moved to Deal or No Deal.  And, um, been very, very famous for a very long time.  I've been, yes, I'm hugely, uh, hugely famous for an eternity.  Now you have a giant hit television show.  Like you guys in radio.  Look what happened to you.  Howie, what was your first break?  I remember seeing you years ago.  Make me laugh.  I came out, I was on vacation.  I was on vacation.  I was in the carpet business.  Make me laugh.  The truth is, do you remember the show Make Me Laugh? 
[02:01:00]  Yes, Gary Mule Deer was on that.  Yes, the same time as me.  The thing I was on, it was actually.  Bobby Van.  Absolutely.  Was the host.  Right, but the one I was on, I was on with, uh, Mike Binder.  Do you know who he is?  No.  Very, the director right now is on with Mike Binder and Gallagher.  Wow.  It was my first to, uh, then Gallagher, wow.  Yeah, in 1978, I went on and did that.  It was on a dare.  I was actually down in, in, uh, Los Angeles on a, uh, I was in business. 
[02:01:30]  I owned carpet stores and then I tried to get into the novelty business and I had this,  I don't know if I talked about this with you before, but I had this Uncle Sherman Flasher  doll.  Did I talk about that?  No.  I had this Uncle Sherman Flasher doll that somebody showed me.  I was down in Florida and I bought this.  It was this little stuffed doll.  It was a little man and he had a trench coat and you opened up this trench coat and you saw  his, his flash.  Yeah, he saw his nuts and, and, and, so I thought, oh, I'm going to make a fortune if  I bring these into Canada because this will be really cool. 
[02:02:00]  So I, so I made a deal with the company and I, uh, shipped them to Canada and they got stuck  at the border and I got accused of bringing, uh, pornography into Canada.  So I went down and so I went down and had a meeting with these people and I said, here's  what we're going to do.  Cause it was, it was like fabric.  It was a fabric doll.  So I said, you ship the doll with a trench coat and the little, the little, uh, cotton nuts  and penis, you ship, uh, separately.  And then I will have somebody assemble them in Canada. 
[02:02:30]  So lo and behold, I got these cases and cases and crates of all these Uncle Sherman dolls,  nutless uncles, Sherman dolls.  And then I had to go down, I got a call, I got a notice to go down to the border to  claim these cases of essentially nuts and penises, but they didn't know what they were.  And I didn't know how to describe what they were.  And I, you know, I was laughing and the guy didn't let me, I couldn't release them.  So I went, I flew down to Los Angeles to have a meeting with the manufacturer, very serious, 
[02:03:00]  uh, corporate meeting on how we were going to get all these nuts into Canada.  And I was staying at the, it's the Hyatt on Sunset.  I don't know if you know that.  Yes, of course.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So right next door, it's on the same, it's on the same lot as where the world famous comedy  store is.  Wow.  And it's also the hotel where the comedian tried to, well, he did jump from the ceiling,  from the, from the roof, excuse me.  And he wanted to land in the, uh, the front stoop of the comedy store.  Steve Levitan.  Oh, no, not Steve Levitan.  That's a writer.  I can't remember. 
[02:03:30]  Levitan.  Steve Levitan.  Did you know him?  Uh, no, I only saw The Stain.  Must have really bombed.  I only saw The Stain.  No, it was a comedy strike or something that once they went back to work, he couldn't get  on stage anywhere.  Something like that, right?  Yeah.  We used to always work for free and then all the comics went on strike and we showed them.  We got, I got to the point where we were getting $10 for a set.  Wow.  Thank God for that strike.  Yes.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you.  $10 in Westwood and $25 in Hollywood because Hollywood was where you wanted to be. 
[02:04:00]  You could make an extra $15 if you did a set there.  So this comedian was distraught.  He went up to the roof and he jumped.  Tried to jump onto the comedy store.  Yeah.  You know, when you're up on a roof, you look like you can, you know.  He looks makeable.  Yeah.  He didn't make it.  He made it to the parking ramp.  Yeah.  That's about it.  But I made it all the way inside and it happened to be amateur night.  I thought I was going to see all these big star comics and it was amateur night.  My friends dared me to get up and make a fool of myself because I was 3,000 miles away from home.  And I had done sets at a place called Yuck Yucks in Canada. 
[02:04:30]  So, and I went up and there was a producer there from that comedy game show called Make Me Laugh.  And he said, would you like to do television?  Wow.  And I thought I was just.  How the hell does that happen?  Jesus Christ.  I know.  I thought it was a joke.  But he invited me the next day to his office and me and my buddies went to, I'd never been at a studio before.  And I did the show and it was a great story to tell about my vacation.  And as luck would have it, it aired and people started calling me because they saw me and I flew down.  I did the Merv Griffin show and I did the Mike Douglas show. 
[02:05:00]  And Diana Ross saw me on one of those and hired me as their opening act.  I didn't have an act.  And they hated me.  Every night I was at Caesar's Palace.  I didn't have anything.  I had a rubber glove I pulled on my head.  So pretty much you're telling us today that you just lucked out.  I did.  There's no reason.  One thing led to another and now I'm on your show.  Yeah.  I'm a big fan of Deal and No Deal.  I don't think we discussed this with you.  The episode was Celine Dion.  Right.  Is that your favorite episode?  It was.  It could be.  It was a bit strange. 
[02:05:30]  She was like on a big screen from Vegas cheering on the contestant.  It was like.  I saw that.  You saw it, Ryan?  Oh, come on.  That was weird.  It was a win.  Now you can win.  You were asking her for her opinion.  Like, what do you think?  It was the finale.  But the girl that was the contestant was like lived, ate, and breathed Celine Dion.  Who doesn't, Howie?  She had her lucky pen and she was her lucky Celine Dion pen.  She should have thrust it into her ears. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, please win the money that my husband lost.  Yeah, she should be on the show.  She's got to make some money back still.  Really?  I can't remember what she won.  That was last year.  You know what happens is they all seem to flow together.  We're in the midst of this year.  I'm actually pretty far ahead in this year.  So I don't remember too much about that game.  Yeah, we do.  Don't worry.  Hey, the first show this season was unbelievable with that Teamster or whatever.  Yeah, the Matty.  Matty, yeah. 
[02:06:30]  He was great.  Oh, was he great?  He was $3 million, went for $3 million, take these and those and don'ts and these.  And he wins, I can't remember what he won, but $300 and something thousand.  But the best for me was the next day I saw him on CNBC on some financial show talking about what you're supposed to do with your money.  All of a sudden this guy becomes an expert.  What was great about Matty, he picked the right case.  He said that whatever the number was, it was an important number for him.  He picked it and he goes, Howie, the $3 million is in this case. 
[02:07:00]  And it turns out it was, but he didn't get in the case.  Yeah, he just didn't go the distance.  Yeah, you opened up that case and there it was.  One of the funniest ones.  You know, they have to because they have to fit it in an hour.  So you don't see some of the stuff that's edited out.  But this is also from last year, but I can't remember specifically what the woman's name is.  But this woman, she picks a number and then halfway through the number, the husband says to me, tell Howie why you picked the case.  And she says to me, I'll be honest with you.  Jesus Christ, our Savior, came to me last night, sat on my bed and told me to pick number 17. 
[02:07:30]  She was telling me this on the, we didn't air that.  Of course.  And I thought, wow, you know, how flattering is that?  Christ could choose any of the game shows to play, but the fact that he's involved.  Yeah, funny.  So she picks that case and she's going through the game and she's screaming, which they cut out, you know, you've got to have the faith.  You've got to have the faith.  Our Lord, our Savior has chosen the case and I've got to have the faith.  And then she starts opening some big numbers.  She goes, I don't care, Howie, I've got to have the faith. 
[02:08:00]  I've got to have the faith.  And then she finally opens the one with $750,000 in it.  And she goes, I'm going to be honest with you, Howie, I lost the faith.  I'll take the deal.  And whatever the money was, she took the deal right then.  As it turns out, when we played the end game to see how good a deal she made, she had $1 million in her case.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  It's funny.  Christ didn't do anything to stop the beheadings in Iraq, but he sat down to tell her about where the money is. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, you could have done something.  Isn't that amazing?  Wow.  He works in strange ways.  He sure does.  How did you not air that, though?  And he had some tapes in shows.  Pardon me?  Yeah, what's the matter?  How did they not air that?  That's hilarious.  The faith stuff, they should have aired that.  I know.  But, you know, they didn't want to get too, I guess, we're a non-secular kind of show.  Wow.  Man, TV is just the oddest thing.  If you ever get a chance, if anybody who's listening ever gets a chance and you want to go see a live taping,  the live taping is as great as the show is, and I'm a huge fan of the show, and I enjoy it in myself. 
[02:09:00]  Well, I am.  I sit down again with my wife, and I could sit and scream and say all the things at the screen that I'm not allowed to say.  I would love to see that.  But the live taping, well, because I'm just not allowed to sway people.  I mean, I cannot believe it.  I can't tell you how many times where I say, you know, tell me a little bit about yourself,  and then somebody says, you know, I'm in debt.  I have a, oh, I've never owned a home.  I have three kids.  I don't know if I'm going to be able to send them to college.  I don't have a car, and I'll, at a certain point of the game, you know, I'll say, you know, listen,  the bank offer is $250,000, and they got like three cases to open. 
[02:09:30]  There's one giant amount left, and they'll turn to me adamantly and go, Howie, no deal.  I came with nothing.  I'm going home with nothing.  I can't tell you how many times I just want to grab them by the neck and go, you idiot.  What the hell is wrong with you?  Yeah, you got nothing at home.  Leave with the money, you jerk.  I can't say that, but, you know, I feel like it sometimes, and that's the hardest part of the job for me.  That would be great if you could just smack someone in the back of their head real hard. 
[02:10:00]  No, I'm making the choice for you.  You moron.  Get out of here.  You're too stupid.  Go back to Hempstead.  It's a lot of money, but what happens is these people, they get, you know, they see $1 million  in the offing on the board, and all of a sudden, you know, $200,000 doesn't mean anything to them.  Yeah.  You know, and that's real.  $200,000 is there.  It's the offer.  That's the cash.  That's the guarantee.  That's 100%.  You know?  Yep.  Your odds in that million, at that particular point, if you have more cases to open than 
[02:10:30]  large numbers, are not going in your way.  But, you know, I guess that's what built Vegas, and that's what built Atlantic City.  Hey, thank God they're there to do that.  It would be boring.  Yeah, I wouldn't have a show.  You know, you got to watch and go, ah, look at this idiot's leaving with nothing.  You make for great TV, but you know what?  When I'm looking at somebody in the eye, it's really hard for me not to just scream and smack.  But apparently, there's a little sign.  You just shut your eyes at night.  Hey, Howie.  I'm snoring.  We got to cut this short.  We're ending this part of the show, unfortunately.  Okay. 
[02:11:00]  You're always a good guest.  What are we promoting today?  Come see me at Town Hall Live.  Thursday, November 9th?  I'll be at Town Hall Live live.  You know, unlike a deal or no deal family show, my show is not a family show.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, you're hilarious.  His stand-up is great.  Well, come see me, guys.  We will.  November 9th, Town Hall.  And you should come in and do the show live while you're in town.  I will, too.  You know what?  I was going to come in that day, but I'm flying in right before the show.  Oh, boy.  But next time I'm in New York, I would love to come in live.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations on all your success.  Thank you.  Howie Mandela.  Thanks, Howie.

[02:15:30]  Check local listings for showtimes  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Oh, let's walk.  All right.  I want to say hi to my cousins.  The twins.  You're related to these twins?  Yeah, I'm related to these cousins.  Oh, my God.  That's Jason.  That's James.  You know how I talk about my Uncle Tom?  Oh, I'll be.  No, I got an Uncle Tom.  Oh, right, right.  Remember Earl used to get really pissed off when I would refer to my Uncle Tom? 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  This is my Uncle Tom's kids, Jason and James.  Wow.  Hello, gentlemen.  Hi.  The beauty.  That's like identical.  How old's Uncle Tom now?  54.  My 54-year-old uncle just had a kid.  Wow.  God bless.  And how old is his wife?  31.  31.  Jesus.  How old are you two gentlemen?  Huh?  How long has he been with her?  25 years.  23.  You guys 23?  They have worked out the dress exactly the same thing, except for the sneakers. 
[02:16:30]  And the undershirt.  And like, because they got the same mustache, same hair.  Yeah.  Like, you'd think one guy would grow the long hair and not have the mustache.  The other guy would have the short hair and the mustache.  But no, these guys are working it.  That's great for crimes, I hear.  Yep.  Alternate rapists.  Like, you can commit a crime and then say it was the other one, and they can never figure  it out, and you both get off the hook.  These guys smile a lot, but they are a problem.  Are they?  Yeah, they could be a problem at any second. 
[02:17:00]  A couple of beers in a bar, and they're racking some head.  Oh, yeah.  They're a problem.  They're racking some head.  Or it could start off with maybe a little bit of a fight between the two of them, and  if someone jumps in, they both jump on the guy trying to help.  Don't let the matching outfits fool you.  Yeah.  They are a problem.  Or if one guy is fighting a guy and knocks him down, and then the other one shows up,  and the guy's like, what the fuck?  Yeah.  Are you saying someday they could wear matching outfits with inmate on the back?  Well, let's just put it this way.  They have the potential to be the first serial twins killers or whatever. 
[02:17:30]  Wow.  Has there ever been, Jimmy?  No.  You're the expert.  Serial killer twins.  Wow.  Hey, guys, work on that.  Yeah, all right.  That's pretty good.  What happened to your body?  What happened to your body?  Holy fuck, Opie.  Opie just walks over like he's saying, hey, how you doing?  Where are you from, bro?  Detroit.  Detroit?  Go Tigers.  All right.  You're visiting New York City?  Yeah, we are here for the Jets game.  Got to watch the Lions get beat up, and now wait for Tigers-Cardinals. 
[02:18:00]  I was hoping Tigers-Mets.  Yeah, so was I.  You have the torso of a 50-foot-tall man with a long torso with short legs.  Yeah, you were supposed to be, like, 7-foot-tall, I think.  I was.  I'm just a little short for my weight.  Yeah, no, it was your long torso.  It's not your weight.  I got to ask you another thing.  The hat looks like a bandwagon jumper hat, my friend.  Yeah.  That is a new Detroit hat.  I bought it a couple summers ago.  It just hangs up.  Usually I wear it a couple of summers, huh?  A couple of man's hat.  It looks pretty new, but are you noticing more of those around? 
[02:18:30]  A lot more.  Yeah, a lot of people all of a sudden are fans.  I think it's the only hat that could fit that skull of his.  Yeah, he has a big-headed boy.  It protrudes outward.  You have to hit him with a fucking Bulek to knock him out.  What are you guys doing in New York?  Just visiting, seeing the sights.  Yeah, yeah.  Tourist crap.  Yeah, right on.  Yeah, tourist crap.  What, Times Square?  Times Square.  Central Park.  Boat tour around the island.  Hey, I did that Saturday.  Which one are you doing? 
[02:19:00]  We did the three-hour yesterday.  That turned into four-hour because the bridge was all blocked up.  They had to turn around and go back.  Oh, Jesus.  Thrill a minute here in the city.  Sailboat or?  No, the circle line thing.  Oh, the circle line.  You know where you go?  Yeah.  Go to the Museum of Natural History.  There's a display called the Ascent of Man.  See where you fit in.  Yeah.  I'll try that.  Yeah, give it a whirl.  It's fun.  Actually, he looks like that fish.  That fish with the teeth.  Help me out there, Anthony.  A nurse shark?  Not a nurse.  Well, that's pretty close. 
[02:19:30]  A what?  A hammerhead.  Not a hammerhead.  It's like the fish with the vicious teeth.  A piranha?  Kind of piranha-ish.  Can we take your picture?  A barracuda?  Can someone take his picture?  I've got to match his face with fish.  He's so sweet to be a fish.  He's a sweet boy.  You are a sweet boy.  Are you here with your...  My wife.  Hello, miss.  Hello, ma'am.  How are you?  Good.  Enjoying New York, are you?  I am.  Yeah?  How long have you guys been married?  Good mic technique, Danny.  Three years?  Very good.  First child, or? 
[02:20:00]  Fat.  Oh.  Oh, no.  OB?  Well, I took a guess.  I'm sorry.  What?  It's just the jacket.  Do you have any children?  No.  No.  Good.  See?  Then you're able to do things like this.  Come to New York and have some fun.  I'll rent a child from another country soon, though.  Are you?  Like permanent?  No, just for a few months.  And then you give it back?  Yeah.  Send them back.  Make a few movies, send them back.  LOL.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No?  Oh, no. 
[02:20:30]  It'll be fun.  Show them everything.  We would have brought them to New York, but we don't get it.  Where are they coming from?  Vietnam.  You're getting a little Vietnamese kid.  Yeah.  How old?  17.  Nice.  Whoa.  That's a little old for a show them around kind of a thing.  Yes.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Enjoy.  All right.  What the hell's going on here, man?  Holy Jesus.  What is going on here?  Does she have napalm scars on her back?  Not yet.  17-year-old Vietnamese girl, and she comes over, and what do you teach her?  Does she go to school?  Go to the school, take her to all of our crappy museums and sporting events. 
[02:21:00]  Sporting events in Detroit.  That's right.  I didn't know this was going on.  Where do you sign up for this?  Craigslist?  Just found it online.  Yeah, Craigslist.  You found it online?  Of course.  And what is it?  Is there a cost to this?  Not just supporting the kid while they're here.  And what?  Do they have parents over there, or are they orphans?  No, they have parents.  And what do they get in exchange?  An education and learn better English.  Oh, so they go back after a while.  If they're still alive. 
[02:21:30]  And what do you get besides an empty ball bag?  A horrible international incident, on my record.  Now, I've got to ask the wife here.  Are you a little worried about a 17-year-old girl in your house?  No.  No?  That will do anything to stay in America?  Exactly.  Exactly.  Now, I would think once she sees the wonders of this country, instead of her hooch that she lives in now, she might be a little desperate to do anything to stay in the country.  Well, I hope not, but you never know. 
[02:22:00]  Are you speaking Vietnamese now?  You sound like that woman that pawns shot in the head.  No.  No.  We're nice people.  We'll take good care of her.  How long is she an American for?  About five months.  That's five months.  You can't teach a lot in five months.  Yeah, teach her enough.  Teach her a good lesson is what you can teach her.  Teach her how to not sit comfortably.  Give me those ribs.  Are you guys XM fans, or?  XM.  Back in the $2 a month days.  Oh, wow.  All right. 
[02:22:30]  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  Then come walk with us.  Yeah.  We'll let you check out the XM show today.  Yeah, you come up and hang out.  Look in the window.  Cousins.  Hi.  How you doing?  The cousin's making the walk today.  I like it.  Oh, my God.  What is going on?  Look at Roland's physique.  Oh, my God.  I was telling someone, his physique is almost unbearably awful.  Just short of unbearably awful.  What's going on?  She looked pregnant, though.  Come on.  Dude, you lobbing insults.  What's with the Vietnamese thing, though? 
[02:23:00]  I don't know.  That is such a...  What's going on?  That guy's going to be banging a 17-year-old Vietnamese girl.  So will she.  Why not?  The three of them.  You think?  Yeah.  Betsy?  Me, you.  Betsy, the gook.  Me, you, the hole.  The slope.  The IUD.  IED.  Fuck me.  I suck.  It's not like she's a real human or anything.  Jesus.  Oh.  Is this Andrew?  Hey, Andrew.  Wow, where have you been?  Look at this.  How you doing, Andrew?  I love watching the decline of Andrew.  Andrew, where the fuck you been? 
[02:23:30]  Andrew, they're taking your spot over there.  The guy took your spot with a box and a cat.  And my spot is a lost spot.  Oh, yeah.  They're taking...  God bless me.  Paid that to me and his money.  Are you cold?  Are you cold today?  I'm cold.  Of course I'm cold.  Are you a little drunk?  You look a little woozy today.  You look a little drunk?  No, I'm not drunk, but I had a couple of views.  A couple of when?  About an hour ago?  Last night.  Oh, last night?  Yeah, I always get my dogs, you know?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box? 
[02:24:00]  What's in the box?  You guys, freak yourselves out.  What is it?  Wow, that looks good, but I am not touching it.  You ate it, Andrew.  No, it's some kind of a cinnamon...  Put it down for a second.  I had to walk away.  Oh, no.  I'm leaving.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, he didn't do that.  Oh, he did not do that. 
[02:24:30]  I'm there.  Oh, no.  He did not just fucking...  Oh, no.  You knew it was coming, right?  Oh, and Opie goes, hey, let me see that.  It was a full cake.  It was a full cake.  He opened it up and was offering a slice.  Opie grabbed it, put it on the sidewalk, and jumped as high as he could and landed on  top of the cake.  Oh, no.  Opie throws money at him, and as it's going towards him, the wind picks it and blows it 
[02:25:00]  down.  Oh, no.  He's like, just go fuck yourself.  As soon...  Oh, was that awful?  Oh, I know.  As soon as you said, put it down, I actually walked away, and I saw you jump up, and I  walked away.  And just heard that smashing of cake under his feet.  You are despicable.  Oh, what a piece of shit.  That was his whole meal for like a week with that cake.  He was happy to show everyone the cake.  Both feet. 
[02:25:30]  Both feet landed right in that cake.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that was beautiful.  It was so cringe-inducing, yet fun to watch.  Oh, my God.  You are horrible.  Please get that video up on YouTube immediately.  Thank God it was on tape.  Oh, no.  Oh, that is going to be a great download, man.  He jumped on the cake with a ball.  Right when he...  I got it right when Opie said, oh, let me see it.  I'm like, that cake is fucking gone.  That cake is dead.  You know where I knew I was in trouble? 
[02:26:00]  When I heard, what's in the box?  Oh, dude.  Watch your back, bro.  What a horrid man.  Dude, you have fucking issues.  We got a good video?  God damn.  You got issues.  That makes me just so happy.  Wow.  He was so proud of his cake.  It was all like sliced and everything.  Oh, my ribs hurt.  It was all pre-sliced.  He was so proud of his cake. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, that was a fucking fantastic cake.  Two big feet.  That's the fucking...  That was the holy grail for homeless people.  It was an unopened, plastic-covered, sliced crumb cake.  God, that looked good.  I'm fucking starving.  Oh, my God.  Oh, the poor bum.  You know, he was so looking forward to that.  He was offering everyone a piece.  Anyone keeping score now?  Opie's feet has claimed a cake and a dog.  But that was both feet.  Yes.  Center of... 
[02:27:00]  Right in the middle of the cake.  It was such a good jump.  The plastic popped.  And the cake squeezed.  Of course, she doesn't want to laugh, but...  Oh, it was awful.  Hey, bonjour.  Oh, hi.  How are you?  Bonjour.  I'm good.  I'm late.  Bella.  I'm barely.  Bella.  Bella.  At work, I'm late.  I have to go.  Oh, you have to go?  Yeah.  Bye.  Have a wonderful day.  What?  Where do you work?  What?  Here.  Fifth Avenue, 57.  Arrivederci.  Arrivederci.  Arrivederci. 
[02:27:30]  Drop a log on me.  Arrivederci.  How long you been there?  How long?  I'm from September until December.  Okay.  Until December.  Very short time.  50 bucks to eat a box.  Are you going back to Italy soon?  Well, I have to go to Madrid for six months.  Madrid.  Oh, no.  You leave?  When do you leave?  I live in Italy.  I live in Italy.  It's a strange year.  But when...  Because I've actually paid for scat.  I'm saying, when do you leave here?  Where?  When?  Where?  Like, when do you leave the States?  Ah, December.  December. 
[02:28:00]  Oh.  December.  You're very sweet.  I have eight.  Are you wearing...  You also.  Are you wearing stockings?  Yeah, because...  Oh, because you're Italian.  Ah, they're stocking.  They're black.  I was thinking...  Yes, because I'm starting to...  Melanie Griffith.  What?  Melanie Griffith, working woman.  Do you remember?  Oh, working girl.  Yeah, working girl.  Ah, so you're trying to, like, be like that.  You want to act like a working girl?  Melanie Griffith is actually a very good actress.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  But please, I'm late. 
[02:28:30]  That's custom here in America.  It means we like you.  We untie your shoes.  We untie your shoes.  And then when you bend over to tie them, we fill you full of shame.  Bonjour.  Oh, that's French.  Wait a minute.  Arrivederci.  Arrivederci.  Just for the audience at home, as those guys are talking to her, I bent down and undid her shoelaces.  No, Jimmy's already got a scope on the blonde at the bus stop.  It's the guy from the Goodfellas painting. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, I'd like to redden his beard with an axe.  Douche.  Oh, shit.  What is going on at the bus stop there?  I don't know.  She's got these stockings with this fish scale thing.  Is she a working girl?  Oh, no.  She's just a chick.  Very expensive?  No.  You think something like that? 
[02:29:30]  Stockings are all cramming the hair down.  Oh, my God.  What a fun walk today.  Oh, that's going to make me laugh all day.  Smack dab in the middle of a fucking...  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Do you know how unsanitary these phones are?  You don't have a cell phone?  Where are you from?  Where are you from?  England.  Oh, England.  Oh, okay.  Hello.  We're just saying hi.  Hi.  Hello, little lad. 
[02:30:00]  But those phones are so dirty.  Ooh.  Who are you calling?  Do you want to use my cell phone?  Who are you calling?  Do you want to use a cell phone?  No?  No one uses the public phone.  Don't look for change in there, because some people do awful things in the change dispenser.  No, thank you.  No, thank you.  You don't have to be shy.  Don't worry.  Don't worry.  We're okay, people.  You guys want to play the lava game?  Who wants to play the lava game?  What's the lava game?  You've seen it on YouTube.  We haven't done it in a while.  As soon as she connects to the party, it's the lava game. 
[02:30:30]  What?  You're just loudly...  You don't remember?  Yeah, we did it once before.  All right, let's play the lava game.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Dialing.  She's dialing the phone.  She's got some kind of a calling card, I believe.  And she's got a daughter and a young son with her at the phone booth. 
[02:31:00]  And Kenny's looking over her shoulder very menacingly.  Kenny, don't upset the family.  Yeah, it's...  They're from England.  They're far away from home.  And they're making a phone call.  It's got to be very nerve-wracking to be in a big city like this from England.  All these people.  It's got to be very helpful.  It's got to be a takiego mom with trying to protect her two children.  And Kenny lurking like a fucking monster over her shoulder.  But at least we're all white. 
[02:31:30]  Yes.  You wouldn't have a job.  Could I say something wrong?  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  to make the call.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, 
[02:32:00]  la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Well, just hung up.  All right.  That was mission accomplished.  Oh, is she an angry limey.  I hope that was a medical emergency.  I'm having a cunectomy.  I'm removing my personality.  Kenny, make sure the cousins come up.  Make sure the creepy couple from Detroit come up.  And any chick who's not with a guy who's willing to suck a cock for a few bucks. 
[02:32:30]  That's right.  There you go, sir.  We'll see you upstairs.  Opie and Anthony, XM202.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go. 
[02:33:00]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of talent on PM.  Opie.  You know, I can't have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt. 
[02:33:30]  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I'm dead.  We'll así all get it. 
[02:34:00]  We'll do it.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  guitar solo 
[02:34:30]  Hi, just logging on to Talituck.  Hi, welcome.  XM.  It's the XM side.  What a fun walkover.  Wow.  Hopi and Anthony show.  XM satellite radio.  You're on the satellite?  Yeah.  What's the satellite?  I've heard you on the radio, but you also, what do you do, the satellite? 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, we do.  And here it is.  Wow.  That was funny.  Between the cake, the la-la game, and our little Italiana.  We had three bits.  I'll be untying her shoes.  We are tough guys.  We pick on the homeless, fat women and their children, and foreign girls.  Yeah.  Poor woman from England trying to make a phone call. 
[02:35:30]  First, she's got Kenny lurking over her shoulder.  And then the la-la song, so she couldn't hear anything.  She had to hang up.  She was very upset.  But those will, those have to get up on YouTube.  By the way, could Wackbag do me a favor and eat their own?  This guy, No Fate 301.  He's just trying to, he's just trying to be a buzzkill every day at this point.  He writes, yeah, way to bring something to the show, Opie.  If you can't be funny, just annoy people and take food away from the homeless.  You are an ass. 
[02:36:00]  He's probably not even a real Wackbag member.  He probably isn't, actually.  That's the insult.  That's why we ask for you guys to eat your own at times.  Yeah, sometimes they just write down.  Let's say hi to Max in Dallas.  Max!  You guys are low-life motherfucking son of a bitches.  Goddamn, I love you guys.  Oh, there we go.  I knew it because he was from Dallas.  I knew he was going to like it.  That's right.  Thank you, Max.  Very nice.  I need some food today.  That's right.  I'd like some crumb cake. 
[02:36:30]  That was a damn, I gave the guy money.  Well, you've got to give him money because that was a fucking brand new.  You know how much it cost?  You know something?  It looked simply delicious.  And you know me.  I wouldn't eat anything within 20 yards of that guy.  And it looked like, wow, that looks very tasty.  It was in plastic.  It was the way it was sectioned off.  It was meant to be sold in a diner.  That was the type you see.  He probably stole it.  In a diner, right.  They put it out behind the glass. 
[02:37:00]  It was sectioned off with little pieces of white cardboard paper in between each slice.  It had cinnamon crisp on top and looked almost like angel food cake.  He sounded very proud of his cake.  Crumb cake.  He was so proud of it, he opened it.  And for some reason, well, he doesn't know Opie.  So whenever Opie asks for a second, can I see that?  You say no.  But he gave it to him, Opie placed it on the sidewalk, jumped up with both feet, came 
[02:37:30]  smashing down onto it.  Where's Sam?  I gotta see the video.  Oh, is that horrid?  If he didn't get this video, he's so fired.  It'd be funny if he had that.  I hope that Sam, as much as I want to see the video, just to see Big Feet squirm, I hope  he had it aimed at fucking E-Rock's coat collar.  That was really uncomfortable.  Yeah, yeah, followed by the biggest laugh you've had in a while.  As I walked away, I just kept going, oh no, oh no.  No, don't do it.  Oh no. 
[02:38:00]  That was a pristine, delicious, if people knew what that is to a homeless guy, that was,  you know, he'll be telling that for over 20 years.  You mean there wasn't one piece missing?  Not one piece missing.  There wasn't.  Not one piece of cake was missing.  Someone is saying, Jim from New Brunswick, did he hear Andrew say he earned that?  I think he spent a week's worth of change on Opie's shoe cake.  Oh, both feet.  Both feet.  With his horrid, dark, bony fingers holding that cake. 
[02:38:30]  What was he, he kept saying a lot, that was mine.  Oh, I know, I couldn't hear what he said after.  Like, what?  No, why?  Like, why?  He couldn't figure out why you would do something like that.  It was so beyond him.  Egg white turkey, one little piece of cheese.  Look, and now he's ordering food.  And get a piece of crumb cake, please.  Yeah, get a piece of crumb cake.  And a piece of crumb cake.  What?  Platter or bagel?  A little platter.  But make sure we got some crumb cake today. 
[02:39:00]  I'm hungry.  Yeah, let me see this.  Did you get it?  Yeah.  You're confident?  Yeah.  Sam's confident.  Very confident.  I'm very confident.  Push play.  Yeah, I'm going to have to look.  Can you turn it this way a little bit?  Wait, you got it at that point?  Oh, okay.  Get the setup.  I guess I'm going to have to look.  All right, what's in the box?  I'm kind of kicking it a little bit.  Andrew is looking up.  He's very proud to show us his cake.  There it is.  A perfect cake.  Individual slices, all wrapped nice. 
[02:39:30]  With the, like Ann said, the paper in between each slice.  Yeah, perfect.  Perfect cake.  Oh, my God!  Oh, no.  Perfect chunk.  Oh, no.  Okay, can I see it, Sam, please?  Dude, you've never seen two feet land more perfectly centered.  They land.  Yeah, and actually, he slips a quarter of an inch because the landing in the cake is so perfect.  You stuck the landing.  I stuck the landing.  And the outside, like, kind of balloons out a little bit from the fucking pressure.  Oh, no.  Please get this up. 
[02:40:00]  That is proud cake.  Get this up, too.  Yeah.  Oh, why did he put it on the ground?  Why?  Oh!  Did you see it slip?  I don't know.  I would have laughed my ass off if I fell back and cracked my skull.  The fucking...  Did you see it?  It sounds like that marathon runner in Chicago.  It was such a perfect jump, he slipped forward.  He slipped forward a little, and cake just came out the sides of your feet.  That is an unsalvageable fucking piece of cake.  No.  Cake.  That's a cake like that in New York. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  They sell by the slice.  That was sliced off to be sold individually.  What does a slice of cake cost?  $2.50.  At least, right?  $3.00.  Say $3.00.  Say $3.00.  12 slices.  That might be a $35, $36.00 cake.  Yeah.  $35.00 cake.  Yeah, let's say hi to Jim in South Carolina.  Jim, get Sam to get that up online immediately.  Jim, what's up?  Jim.  Hey there, Jim.  Yeah.  Talk.  You're on the air, Jim.  Jim, South Carolina.  Phone's working?  Yeah, we already took one, right?  Jim, you're out, right? 
[02:41:00]  Did we take one?  Ed Asner wants to say hi.  Ed Asner.  Hi.  Hi, Ed.  I told you he was a fucking destroyer.  Yeah, Ed Asner did call me the destroyer of all good things.  Jeff in Pittsburgh, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I got to tell you, that might be some of the funniest 20-odd minutes of radio I've heard in a long time, guys.  Make sure you get that entire walkover on YouTube.  We had a really, really good walkover today.  Sometimes we just walk and nothing happens, and sometimes things are thrown at us, and that was great. 
[02:41:30]  We had three things.  Thank you, sir.  That might be one of the most evil things we've ever done.  That was pretty nasty.  Nah.  I got to say, that was pretty nasty.  What?  Doesn't be take the wig.  That was probably the evilest thing I've ever seen Opie do.  What?  Oh, so when did the broadcast start directly from hell?  Oh, wow.  Years ago.  True.  I heard Anthony actually say, you have serious problems.  Yeah, you have serious problems. 
[02:42:00]  No one jumps on a homeless man's cake.  I don't think it's ever been done.  Why?  Like Jimmy said, why would you do it?  You know, when that video hits the internet, people are going to be like, yeah, that's set up.  There's no way anyone would actually do that.  It's just, and we hadn't seen him in a month because some other guy took his spot.  Yeah, the refrigerator box that we reference every once in a while on the walkover, that's where Andrew used to be.  Yeah, but that guy obviously is higher in the pecking order.  Yeah.  On the plains of the Serengeti, he is the lion, and Andrew is the hyena. 
[02:42:30]  Right.  And he had to move.  He had to move.  So he moved, and we hadn't seen him in a month.  He was so proud of his cake.  That's what makes me feel bad, is how proud of his cake he was.  They were the fruits of his efforts.  Oh, he's like, and then, no, why?  Why?  Why?  Do you understand that he's replaying that?  He's looking at that cake still.  He's replaying it over and over, and he's looking at the shoe prints in it. 
[02:43:00]  And not only was there a shoe print in it, but you slid forward, which just mushed it.  You know what that's like, Jimmy?  I guarantee he's going to eat that cake.  Of course he will.  It's cake soup for him.  You know what that's like?  Take your caddy and drive it somewhere and have someone drop a huge, like, wrecking ball in the middle of it.  That's what that's like to him.  And then throw not enough money at me and walk away.  Yeah, 200 bucks and walk away.  Let's say hi to Eric in New York.  Eric.  Hey, boys, good morning.  What you're really missing is the audio part of it. 
[02:43:30]  It sounded like a blown-up tire.  Yeah, you heard a plastic pop.  Because it was wrapped in plastic.  Right.  So the plastic kind of held the cake in one spot when Opie jumped on it.  So he slipped a little bit, but it also popped open.  So, yeah, it sounded like a tire blowing out.  Dude, it was a fucking perfect wrapped plastic brand new cake.  If there was an Olympic event for homeless cake destroying, I think Opie would have gotten a 10.  All right.  I've been obsessing. 
[02:44:00]  Or you just talk.  I've been obsessing ever since, I think it was Friday show, a guy.  Were you there for the can guy?  No, I was away.  A guy who's making his living by collecting cans.  He had probably, how many really?  400 cans?  Like two huge bags.  Yeah, I was there.  More than that.  And I asked to see the cans and I was going to throw them all on the road on 57th.  All in the middle of 57th.  And they got me on video and I failed miserably because just as I was going to commit to my  cruel act, a freaking NYPD cop car, you know, made the turn. 
[02:44:30]  How funny would that be though?  If you threw it in the street and got arrested?  Oh, got arrested for littering.  Hey, we got Hitler checking in.  Hitler!  First, Anthony, I appreciate your support.  Right.  Opie, that was just evil.  Even Hitler.  Yeah.  You lost your accent down there.  Yeah, you're not Hitler.  You lost your gumption.  What happened?  Who the fuck?  He doesn't have that.  Hey, born and father.  Yeah, same.  Verve.  Zest for life that he had.  All right. 
[02:45:00]  That's good.  All right.  Let's go to Troy in Kansas.  Troy?  Hey, boys.  Good morning.  Morning.  Just when I think things can't get any evil or they just get worse than worries, that's  why I'll keep my subscription for sure.  All right, sir.  I can't wait to see it with the audio.  All right.  You know what?  Why don't we take a break?  I want to hear that audio again.  Can we, like, the whole bit?  We'll do the whole...  Yeah, not the whole...  I mean, it's only a minute, right?  24 seconds.  24 seconds?  That's it?  Okay.  Man's life can be destroyed in 24 seconds. 
[02:45:30]  I want to hear what happened afterwards because I was laughing way too hard.  My cake!  Why?  Did he say that?  Why you hurt my cake?  Did we have a mic on him?  Sort of?  He said...  I heard him.  Yeah?  I don't know if the mic picked it up, but I heard him say, like, why?  Oh, you can hear him?  All right, we'll listen back to that after the break.  No.  Oh, it's...  The virus is out.  Tell your friends.  He's infected.  That's right, Opie. 
[02:46:00]  Hey, you f***.  Shut your mouth.  I love the homoerotic nature of the whole event.  The virus made my genitals rot off.  Whoa, dude, don't come near me.  We're your celebrity skin cancer connection.  It was better than my first kiss.  Okay.  Laugh until your energy spill out on the chair.

[02:47:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  You want to hear that audio back?  Oh, yes.  What are you doing over there?  I was trying to text and keep the cop in the middle of my text twice in a row.  Fucking text me.  So, I go to...  You know what happens when you get text in the middle of texting? 
[02:48:00]  What happens?  Your text goes away.  Yeah.  I don't know how to bring it back.  Yeah.  So, I had a nice long break to fucking text.  Yeah.  And now, uh...  I'm done.  Did you send it?  Yeah.  But I bounced...  I bounced Keith from the room.  Good.  You should.  God damn it.  I fucking blasted you with one.  I was really...  I was watching you type away.  You should get a...  These fucking phone companies suck.  I'm eight feet away and my text didn't make it.  I'm watching him text and I sent one to him.  I'm like, oh, he's typing away. 
[02:48:30]  Thank you.  Oh, please God.  It didn't work.  No.  That sucks.  Fuck if they didn't get their fesna.  All right.  Cake stomping on the Opie and Anthony show, just in case you missed it.  Actually, we're playing it because we want to hear how good it sounded on the radio.  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  What's in the box?  You guys.  Oh.  What is it?  Wow.  That looks good, but I am not touching it.  You eat it, Andrew.  No.  Some kind of a cinnamon cakey thing.  Oh, come on. 
[02:49:00]  I had to walk away.  Oh, no.  I'm leaving.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, he didn't do that.  Oh, he did not do that.  I earned that.  I earned that.  I earned that.  He did not just fucking.  Oh, no.  You knew it was coming right when he goes, hey, let me see that.  It was a full cake.  You'll hear him. 
[02:49:30]  It was a full cake.  He opened it up and was offering a slice.  Opie grabbed it, put it on the sidewalk, and jumped as high as he could and landed on top of the cake.  Oh, no.  Opie throws money at him, and as it's going towards him, the wind picks it and blows it down.  Oh, no.  He's like, just go fuck yourself.  As soon.  Oh, was that awful.  Oh, I know.  As soon as you said, put it down, I actually walked away, and I saw you jump up, and I walked away.  I just heard that smashing of cake under his feet. 
[02:50:00]  You are despicable.  Oh, what a piece of shit.  That was his whole meal for like a week was that cake.  He was happy to show everyone the cake.  Dude, both feet.  Both feet landed right in that cake.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that was beautiful.  My favorite part is Jimmy just yelling, what a piece of shit.  What a piece of shit.  And then you just hear him going, ah, ah, ah, ah. 
[02:50:30]  You can't really hear words.  It's just, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  He sounds like a James Bond villain.  Sam's getting the video together for OpianAnthony.com.  He's got to have some of that stuff that happened after the cake stomping.  Definitely.  Maybe he can mix the video audio with the radio audio.  and really do it upright.  Yes.  That's not a bad idea.  Sink it up.  Sink it up or something.  Yeah.  Oh.  But you want the reaction after the cake stomp. 
[02:51:00]  Thank you, Ken.  It's egg whites.  I thought that smell was coming out of Jimmy's asshole.  He blasted one before we went on the air.  That just sounded horrific.  Oh, really?  It sounded like an earthquake.  All right.  We're going to move on finally.  Ooh.  You will.  What do you got there?  Egg whites?  Egg whites.  Is there cheese in there?  No.  You're not a cheese guy.  Sometimes cheese.  Yeah.  What happened to the turkey, though?  Everything in moderation.  Uh-oh. 
[02:51:30]  No turkey?  Where's the boss's turkey?  Oh, wait.  There's some turkey in there.  All right.  All right.  For turkey.  Why?  Why are you still texting?  No, I'm not.  Oh.  I'm done.  Did you get mine?  Yeah, finally.  That's what rang.  And I can't look that.  God damn slow phone shit company.  All right.  What's going on with Africa?  That's a fucking, just a, ah, I'm so sick of it.  Why? 
[02:52:00]  Here's the headline.  Yeah.  Cute story.  Dad stands trial over daughter's mutilation.  A father stands accused of the unthinkable.  He brutally cut, cutting his daughter's genitals.  The girl was two.  What?  Um.  By the way, Madonna is adopting the genitals.  Oh.  As we speak.  That's.  She, ah.  Nothing.  That's very funny.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Monday, activists from all over the world focused on Gwinnett County courtroom is Khalid  Adem, accused of cruelty to a child and aggravated battery for allegedly circumcising 
[02:52:30]  his daughter.  He goes on trial.  Now, this guy was accused of cutting her clit off with scissors when she was two.  Oh.  That just gave me that tingly feeling.  Yeah, I know.  I got a little heart in my heart, too.  I hate that.  I don't mean like that.  Well, he actually is denying, and he's saying he did not do it, um, that the wife's family  did it, because they're all African, I think.  Um.  So, I can't, I don't know if he did it or not.  But.  Just the fact that there's a culture that still does it.  He was born in Ethiopia, where circumcision is a common procedure for young girls. 
[02:53:00]  What savages.  If that isn't the definition of savage.  If you're cutting your daughter's clit off, your culture is shit.  If you cut the clit off your fucking daughter, your culture is shit.  Do you think they cut the clit off, and then get into their suit, and take their briefcase,  and hop in their car, and go off to IBM?  I certainly doubt it.  I doubt it, too.  How awful. 
[02:53:30]  That is a horrid practice.  Why do they do that?  Is it like, um.  I'll tell you why.  Two, one is to make sure that the woman doesn't get that much sexual pleasure, because they  don't want her cheating.  Yeah.  There's so many places in the world where there's fucking, these weak fucking men.  If you're not a good enough fuck to keep your woman faithful, that's your own problem.  Eat her pussy for once, you silly geese.  Well, that ain't gonna happen.  In the Middle East, they make them dress, showing only their eyes, because none of those  fucking weak-minded people can avoid fucking a girl if they see her. 
[02:54:00]  They can't avoid it.  They can't help it.  Well, what's the, it's like here, they think the women won't be able to help themselves.  Um, they don't want the women going out and cheating and fucking early, so they cut their  clits off to cut down on sexual pressure.  And if one person compares male circumcision to this, I'll fucking scream for breeze on you.  Don't do that.  We got it.  No.  No way.  I need some feedback.  Whoever's comparing it, don't even read it to me yet, let me say.  I do think male circumcision is barbaric and outdated as well.  But it's more done for a hygiene thing. 
[02:54:30]  It is not, and it's stupid, agreed.  But it's not done to keep men from feeling sexual pleasure.  Man, I'm circumcised.  And believe me, I've spent a lot of money.  I certainly get sexual pleasure.  It's not done to keep men from cheating.  It's not done to repress men.  Am I circumcised?  Um, you're clipped, as I like to say.  Clipped?  I don't know.  Well, what's the guy say on instant feedback?  Oof.  I mean, it doesn't look like an anteater.  Oh, no, no.  It's nice.  It looks like a little, uh, looks like a little pink building.  Doesn't it give you more pleasure when you get all chopped up?  No.  No, I think that the foreskin is better.  I think circumcision sucks. 
[02:55:00]  Why?  Because your dick was made that way.  You don't need it cut off.  I, uh, I'm very happy with my cock.  Yeah, I mean.  I, uh, don't, uh, you know, it's, uh, it's a circumcised model.  Um, but, like, it's not like, oh, it's circumcision.  Oh, I wish I wasn't, uh, circumcised.  You know, I don't care.  But if I wasn't, I'd probably be like, ah, I'm happy with that, too.  I'm sure you're supposed to be made that way.  It's not an accident nature put foreskin on.  It's just a stupid religious ritual.  We should not have our cock tips cut off. 
[02:55:30]  It's ridiculous.  But it's not done for the same reason as female fucking circumcision.  It's not done by a culture who completely dominates one gender in the culture to fucking completely keep them from fucking anyone and to not feel sexual pleasure.  So what's the instant feedback saying?  Have some kind of power over them.  I just say, you know, it pisses him off that we circumcise boys.  Oh, yeah, I do.  I agree.  Greg in Jersey.  Hey, good morning, fellas.  Hey.  Hey, Greg.  I was going to say that getting clipped is not just about hygiene.  It's also about looking like everybody else in the locker room, too. 
[02:56:00]  You don't want to be the only guy with the unclipped dick.  Well, a lot of people did get made fun of back in school in the shower if they weren't clipped.  Walking around there with the uncircumcised penis.  Yeah, it's ridiculous.  I don't think chicks like that.  Too bad what they like.  Dude, the rest of the world, men are uncircumcised.  And chicks do like it.  Hey, what happened?  I don't know.  The whole world has been fucking going for millions of years.  What do you think? 
[02:56:30]  Only uncut penises are getting pussy?  What's wrong with you?  Julie in Kentucky, what's up?  Hi, how are you guys today?  Hello, Jewel.  Hi.  Now, you guys, for one and everything, my son wasn't circumcised when he was born because  my first husband was not circumcised.  He didn't want our son circumcised.  Okay.  It's horrible to pull the foreskin back, though, because you have to pull that foreskin back  and it's stuck to the head of their penis.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  It can stink.  It can be unclean.  Sure.  Like anything else. 
[02:57:00]  Why don't you just...  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  What I'm saying, though, is you have to pull that foreskin away from the skin so it's red  and it bleeds and everything else.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Nice.  What is it bleeding from?  Enjoy that smoothie.  It's because it's attached to the head of the skin.  It's attached to the head.  It's attached to the head.  Well, how unclean was the...  You mean when you're born, it's attached to the head?  Well, no, but the reason that they make you pull it away, because if you don't, then 
[02:57:30]  it could possibly close up around the hole of the penis to keep them from going to the  bathroom.  All right.  Well, maybe, but...  You have to pull the foreskin back for...  Just get rid of that foreskin.  No, leave it there.  Oh, it's like an appendix.  Keep it clean.  I heard it can smell cheesy.  Keep it clean.  It can probably trap a good piss scent, but just make sure that you keep your cock clean.  I'm sure you could collect enough yeast for bread.  Yeah.  You don't understand, though, and everything.  When they're born, that foreskin is attached to the head.  You have to pull it back and get it pulled back. 
[02:58:00]  All right.  And you have to put Vaseline in there every time to pull it back.  To keep it from growing back.  Give it a little tug.  Oh, listen.  Yeah.  All right.  It gets ugly here.  This guy got...  Thank you.  This guy got circumcised at 14.  Eric.  Oh.  Yeah, guys.  What's up?  I'm 14 years old.  Came here from Mother Russia, and the Jewish community leaned on us, on my parents, and I  had to get circumcised.  Why wouldn't you run away from home?  I should have. 
[02:58:30]  Believe me.  At 14.  I was walking one month like Robert Reed in the room.  Does it hurt?  Oh, it's brutal.  You know, full anesthesia.  Full?  So you're completely under, and what do you think of your new cock?  I love it.  You love your new cock?  Brand new model.  Do the stitches keep breaking?  Oh.  Dude.  And my cousin was circumcised at 28.  What an idiot.  Hey, is there any difference sexually in the pleasure you feel?  No.  Okay, is it not? 
[02:59:00]  No.  I always look like the foreskin, because it's skin going over the head.  So I think if you would jack it up...  I have a friend who's not circumcised, and it just needs a bit more cleaning to do, you  know?  He just has to pull it back and clean it in, you know?  Clean the head.  A horse.  Like a horse.  Yeah, you got dirt and gravel.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, you've got some dirt.  Yeah, Anthony knows what it is.  And a Lego.  In your sheath.  You've got some brambles.  I actually wrote a list called Goofy Gags to Play on Your Uncircumcised Pals. 
[02:59:30]  Where is this list?  I don't remember.  I remember one of them was putting itching powder in it and stapling it shut.  I don't remember.  One was putting crazy glue on the foreskin and attaching it to a tailpipe.  Not to interrupt you, Jim.  Okay.  What I got for my circumcision from the Jewish community was a nice Timex worth 19 bucks.  Oh, God.  That's awful.  You can count the hours away as you're screaming in pain.  Yeah, I believe I love it.  I've been in agony for two days. 
[03:00:00]  And they got to keep the piece of galamah.  And the galamah.  All right.  And they had a good year.  Did you get a moil who sucked it out?  No, I was done in the hospital.  Oh.  All right.  Well, we got a guy that was 26 when he got circumcised.  Wow.  Isaac, Charlotte, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Isaac, oy.  Why 26?  Oh, your friend.  Your friend was 26.  Yeah.  I had a buddy.  Two weeks ago, yeah.  He's 26, and he's getting married, and his wife didn't like it cut.  So she asked him to go for the surgery to get it cut, and he said he would. 
[03:00:30]  Well, his wife is an emasculating twat.  And if she can't accept him for the way he was fucking born, hey, could you cut your cock  tip off and then I'll love you?  He's going to have an awful marriage.  An awful marriage.  She's a castrating witch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's about as close as you can get to castration.  He said it's the worst decision he ever made.  Now he wants to back out of the whole marriage.  He said he should.  Why would he marry such a cunt?  She wouldn't, what, did she not want to put it in her mouth?  You know what an awful fuck she must be?  Oh, wow. 
[03:01:00]  God, does that annoy me.  You know, there's a society that is like a club almost, some type of thing, an entity  that wants to bring back their foreskins.  Yeah, where they weigh it down and shit.  So they have different fixtures and clamps and things.  Yeah.  And they wear weights a certain part of the day, which is supposed to stretch the skin  around the penis back over the head of their dick.  Can you fucking believe that shit?  Is that real?  Yes.  Saw it on HBO, real sex, gotta be real. 
[03:01:30]  But what they don't show you is that the hairline moves back on your head as your back is slowly  sucked down and under.  What do you think, you're creating extra skin?  It constantly looks like you're pulling your ass cheeks apart.  Every time you step down and make a point, your dick jumps.  Dave in Virginia.  Dave.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, Dave.  My wife's a doctor.  She said if you don't get circumcised, it can cause a really nasty infection.  It probably can do, but the rest of the world is not circumcised. 
[03:02:00]  And look what savages they are.  Good point.  They're decapitating each other, hijacking planes.  Bad example.  Your wife's a doctor.  What are you?  I work at missions.  As what?  I get kids in the college.  Okay.  Missions.  Missions.  Admissions.  Oh, admissions.  All right.  So you work at admissions at a college and she's a doctor.  Exactly.  Okay.  Ouch.  That's great.  Guys, I also saw Voss in Richmond this past weekend. 
[03:02:30]  Voss and Bonnie.  Where?  What do you do?  They had a great show.  All right.  Good.  You do the EZ form during tax time and your wife has to have it sent out to an accountant,  right?  Guys, I have no idea how much money I make or anything.  It all goes to her and she does all the books.  Yeah.  Good thing.  I think you might have a huge cock.  Yep.  Yeah.  She probably looks at your paycheck and thinks it's cute.  Thrown in with hers.  We'll get some groceries.  That's a doctor.  She weighs it every freaking month. 
[03:03:00]  Doesn't make much money, but he's got a huge hog.  What do I do?  What do I do?  All right.  Thanks, Dave.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  See ya.  He's a fucking cock like the tail of a Komodo dragon.  Where's the...  Oh, yeah.  This is a great story for today.  It's quick, too.  It's cute.  What is it?  It's a cute story like the circumcision.  Yeah.  I like stories.  Two-year-old girl circumcision.  We deliver keggers.  We deliver keggers. 
[03:03:30]  Police in Connecticut looking for the person who threw a beer keg into an open fire.  It happened in Milford on Sunday.  The keg exploded, setting chunks of metal into a crowd of people at a party.  The blast killed 22-year-old Sean Caselli.  Seven others are hurt.  One neighbor said the explosion was so loud it shook the windows of nearby homes.  Wow.  What?  You threw it into a fire?  Probably not on purpose.  Just to be a dick.  Just to be idiots.  You don't think it's going to kill someone.  But you got to think... 
[03:04:00]  Who wouldn't think that a sealed metal container thrown on a fire isn't going to explode?  I don't know.  It's one of those things.  Especially if there's beer inside of it.  Who's around it that didn't move?  Yeah.  I mean, it's fun to watch for like 30 seconds.  And you've got to start thinking, this thing might explode.  This is going to explode.  Why don't we get it out of there?  There's always some idiot...  We used to hang out in the woods when I was a kid.  It was a big thing to just go into the woods with a little bottle of whiskey or something  and just hang around, smoke cigarettes, drink whiskey around a fire in the woods, get 
[03:04:30]  naked, hug each other, whatever you're into.  And there was always some asshole that would be like with the paint can and his lighter,  making the flamethrower.  And then, yay, guys, throw the paint can into the fire.  And you'd all have to run for your life.  Literally.  You couldn't sit there.  And boom, the fucking thing would explode and metal would go flying.  You'd look at the trees and see chunks of metal in there.  People don't think. 
[03:05:00]  They just don't think of consequences.  Throw a keg in a fire.  Fuck.  Now that guy's dead.  I remember when I was a boy, a friend I palled around with, there were some leaves and he  set them on fire.  Yeah.  And then what happened?  Oh, that was it.  That was all.  Sure.  There was a...  We had to throw dirt on it.  There were seven leaves.  All right.  I wouldn't even throw snowballs at cars like people would do that.  Because even as a kid, I'd be like, well, what happens if you throw one and it hits his 
[03:05:30]  windshield and he gets surprised and kind of swerves and crashes?  So, yeah, like I would always have that in my mind.  So, I never did shit like that.  You're a fun kid.  Yeah, I was kind of the stick in the mud.  Don't do that.  You're a wet blanket.  Until I was introduced to the wonders of alcohol.  Well, then that kind of got it to the point where I started backing my truck through garage  doors and stuff like that.  I didn't care.  My mother did that when she was learning to drive. 
[03:06:00]  She was learning to drive in North Brunswick.  It was a big move for her to get her license.  And she just stepped out of reverse in the driveway and just crashed the garage door and  bent the whole thing in.  And I'll never forget, me and my father just looking at it and looking at each other and  fucking howling.  Good laughing at mom.  We just laughed at her.  Typical woman driver.  Right into the...  I don't know.  There's two ways to go.  Into the street or into your home.  Mom. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, 50-50 shot, mom.  It was really funny.  Hey, Matt from Goose Bay.  I don't like what you're writing.  There are five of us and every one of us voted that Opie is most likely going to throw  propane tanks into a fire.  That could happen.  Why me?  I don't know.  You might get a little rambunctious.  Jennifer Connecticut, what's up?  Jennifer?  Yes.  What's up, Jennifer?  Hey, how you doing?  What's up?  Your name sucks ass.  I'm sorry.  Everybody in 1971 was Jennifer or Michelle. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, shit.  Or Brandy.  So I just wanted to tell you, I'm a mother baby nurse and I'm very anti-circumcision and  I actually go out of my way to...  All right, hold on.  We got a girl, Stacey, from Connecticut.  I prefer a cut.  So why don't we get Stacey to talk to Jennifer?  We got one pro and one con as far as tearing apart the penis.  I actually go out of my way to convince parents not to circumcise their babies.  Can we get Stacey on the line?  Blocked cock blocker. 
[03:07:30]  No, the phone's frozen up.  Nothing.  Shit.  Ah, the phone's frozen up.  Most doctors try to convince parents to have their...  Oh, where'd she go?  And then the phone jump to line three and all by itself, there's a ghost in the machine here.  What's happening?  We didn't hang up on you, miss.  Can you call back?  Maybe it's God calling.  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah.  All right.  No.  That was weird.  I don't know why that happened.  It's God.  Why'd you jump on the cake?  I provided that for him. 
[03:08:00]  He was hungry.  One dip and double.  I earned that.  He'll still eat it.  Of course he will.  Spit and gravel out.  He eats it and that crunch sound, that loud crunch of a little pebble in your tooth.  Can we send a scout out to see if he's eating it?  Oh, yes.  Send them a scout.  We absolutely should.  We have a scout.  Send Craig.  Craig.  Go see if the homeless guy still has his cake.  Wait, should he have the camera too?  Yeah.  We should get Craig, should have the camera, and we should film that man eating his foot 
[03:08:30]  cake.  Can you go see if the homeless guy still has his cake?  Footprint cake.  Yeah, yeah.  He's between.  Someone show him where it is.  Between here and there.  I don't know where it is.  You want me to carry?  You want me?  Bring a video camera.  Sam's going to go.  Yeah.  What kind of tread is on your shoe?  Just tell him it's waffles.  You just made him waffles.  Oh, wow.  They're my brand new Timberlands.  Oh.  Oh, cool.  Nice.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nice for the win.  I thought it was a toy pistol.  That's why when Thomas was selling a customer coffee, he continued the transaction while 
[03:09:00]  the masked robber just stood there.  But when the coffee sale was complete, everything changed.  And that's when the robber put the gun in my face.  At that point, I grabbed the .357 Magnum that's next to my register and pulled the hammer  back.  In a flash, the robber lunged for Thomas' gun.  The two wrestled over the counter for it, and the Magnum went off.  The robber fell as he was leaving the store empty-handed, but police aren't sure if he  was struck by a bullet or not.  The thief is believed to have left in a car waiting outside. 
[03:09:30]  The store is right next door to a preschool for at-risk and special needs children.  They find today's events unnerving.  Oh, it's very scary, because anything can happen.  You know, the police can go any direction at all.  Thomas Humphrey was focused on the safety of the two customers who were still in the  store.  They were fine, but the attempted robbery has left store workers feeling angry.  We're trying to help the community as it is. 
[03:10:00]  You know, we're trying to make sure there's stuff being located for other people.  And here we are having other people trying to rob us for what little money that we actually  have.  I know it's next to a special needs school.  What's that got to do with anything?  Nothing.  They just wanted to say that and get the reaction.  Wanted to get a tart on camera.  It's scary.  So what happened?  I had the boom boom.  I made one in my pants.  Some guy came in to rob the place, and I didn't know the guy behind the register had a 357 Magnum. 
[03:10:30]  But what an idiot.  He pulls it out and cocks it and lets the guy lunge at him?  Yep.  Come on.  Don't think.  You got that in your house, in your hand, and you cocked that thing back.  Boom.  Gone.  Goodbye.  See ya.  Shoot him right in the face.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We're going to get into some other things.  Shoot him in the face.  Some other things today.  Vince, shut the fuck up.  We got to think about the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  Do we continue after this contest is over and do the thinnest girl?  I like the, and I like still calling it Fatty Pig Fatty. 
[03:11:00]  Absolutely.  To really get them all.  Fatty Pig Fatty Part 2.  Yes.  Part 2.  And please get a treadmill that we can give away.  How about a...  The guiniest girl.  Wait, wait, wait.  Yeah.  A toothpick.  All right.  Fatty Pig Fatty.  Okay.  We can keep calling it that.  I don't know.  Maybe it ought to be like Fatty Pig Fatty and then, you know, kind of a second name, like  the second chapter, like Electric Boogaloo.  Yes.  Or something.  How about Fatty Pig Fatty, the bile knuckles edition? 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  Edition.  Something like that.  Yeah.  We'll come up with something.  And don't forget negative campaign ads about people on the Opie and Anthony show.  About the show.  So, yeah, we're collecting those starting today.  Yes.  Go to opiananthony.com and send them in, okay?  Right.  All right.  It's time for another Opie and Anthony show scream-along. 
[03:12:00]  Shut up.  Shut up.  Okay.  Terrific.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Jim Norton from the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi, Angel.  Hi.  New York City.  I'm coming back.  November the 10th.  Hammerstein Ballroom.  Tickets are on sale now at Ticketmaster. 
[03:12:30]  Here in New York, November 10th.  Hammerstein Ballroom.  I'll be performing with our own Nathaniel and another guest who I have to figure out yet.  For more information, check out Jim's website at eatobullet.com.  We'll be right back. 
[03:13:00]  We just got to figure out how it's going to work.  Creatively, I like it.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  But creatively, it's good.  Yeah.  Dynamite's good, too.  All right.  We're back.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, it's not going to blow things apart.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  You know what?  We haven't talked about Bush.  Bush.  His name.  Bush.  What?  Stay the course.  Stay the course.  Stay the course.  Stay the course.  Stay the course.  Stay the course.  Stay the course.  What's he been saying now for years?  For years, Bush.  People are saying that the cake jumping incident was a dramatization.  I'm here to say it was no dramatization. 
[03:14:00]  I wish we could be that creative and clever to stage something on the walk like that or do  something.  People are saying.  It would really be nice if we actually had that motivation.  But no, we just walk.  Wouldn't we then plan something real fun every day?  Some of our walks suck.  All it is is a walk.  Some.  And us commenting on the weather.  What are you listening to?  Because we have to walk from point A to point B. 
[03:14:30]  Sometimes things happen.  Right.  What the fuck?  I want to get a baby and put pit bull bait on its feet.  Ooh.  Nothing says good radio show like my cousin's falling asleep on the couch.  I got to tell you.  Thanks for the support, guys.  Jesus.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jennifer in Connecticut.  Jennifer.  Hi.  Hi.  Hey, regular guys were fired?  Were they really for that?  Come on.  Come on.  Go to regularguys.com. 
[03:15:00]  I don't have to.  I got an email from one of the guys.  What?  Hi.  How are you doing?  Yeah, we got fired.  I never met you, but we share an agent and had a link to the site and what is written  on the circumstances that they got fired under.  Fuck those guys.  You know how many things they blatantly took from our website over the years?  Fuck them guys.  I, uh.  Did you really get an email?  Yeah, I don't know.  I guess you must have.  How did you get my email?  I don't know.  My question is this opening slot in Atlanta, one of the top 10s that we're not on. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, we'll be on.  That's what we do now.  We take your job.  Let's go in Atlanta.  Atlanta.  Ask him about the wiffle ball bat challenge.  I did that.  They, we start there, but if we, you know, say too much, then we sound like you know  who, so.  Who, who.  But they know what they do.  Jennifer Connecticut, what's up?  Yes, you fuckers hung up on me.  No, I swear.  We have stupid phones.  All right, Jennifer, you hate.  Circumcision.  All right, you hate circumcision. 
[03:16:00]  And you're a nurse, right?  Yes, I'm a registered nurse, and I've been a registered nurse for nine years, and I've  always done neonates.  When, when you have a, when you have an uncut, uh, cock in your mouth, uh, like it or hate  it?  Honestly.  Disgusting.  Disgusting.  Disgusting.  But you know what?  Um, I've seen babies bleed out and almost die from circumcision.  Wait, now, do you in your personal life prefer a man who's circumcised or uncircumcised?  You know what?  Honestly.  Definitely uncircumcised, I, I, because I know that it's painful, and I did it to all 
[03:16:30]  three of my children, and I regret it.  I wish that I could have, uh, made a different choice.  Well, have you ever held an unclipped one in your mouth?  Yes.  I have to be honest, yes.  Good girl.  But, well, uncircumcised and circumcised, and uncircumcised is definitely...  You whore!  Well, your mouth is a, is a penis weigh station, but now, now, do you, uh, you do prefer uncircumcised? 
[03:17:00]  It's different, you know, that's different from my professional opinion, because I've  seen babies bleed out and, and almost...  What the hell are you getting circumcised, uh, seeing circumcisions?  Pencil sharpeners?  Yeah, what the fuck, how they almost bleed out.  Alright, we got a girl that loves cut penises.  Uh, Stacey, you're on with Jennifer.  Hi.  Hi.  Stacey?  Hi, Jennifer.  Have you ever seen a baby getting circumcised?  Uh, unfortunately, I never had any boys, I only had girls.  Well, they strap them down.  Nice.  Okay, arms and legs.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:17:30]  And, um, they cut their foreskins off, and, uh, they scream and cry in, in pain and agony.  Whoever says that it doesn't hurt is lying.  Of course it hurts, but you're a kid, you don't remember.  I don't remember.  Aren't there little, aren't there little, like, trays they put them in with the shape of a baby in it?  And they, and they put straps on their arms, straps on their legs.  They what?  They put straps on their arms and straps on their legs.  Yeah, you can't have them kicking or, you know, grabbing at themselves.  It is fucking barbaric.  They gotta strap them down. 
[03:18:00]  It's barbaric.  It's the worst thing you've ever seen in your life.  And they bleed all over the place.  And, uh, one time, one baby almost died, and they had to, um, you know, cauterize the, uh, blood vessel because it was kicking out.  It was really bad.  Yeah, I, I understand that it's bad, but it's, it's just much better in the long run for hygiene and, and everything.  I mean, I, I, there are a lot of nerves underneath the foreskin that are taken off with the foreskin, and it didn't.  All right, well, Stacey's a fan of the cut penis, right, Stacey? 
[03:18:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Well, when you're giving head, it's a lot better.  Yeah.  Why is that, Stacey?  Why?  It's a lot better than the taste of an uncut penis.  It's disgusting.  Well, what does an uncut penis taste like, Stacey?  They didn't clean well enough.  All right, shut up, Jennifer.  We get your point.  Stacey, what does an uncut penis taste like?  Um, like, Stacey.  Stacey.  Is your name Stacey?  I can't compare it to anything.  Still talking.  It's just, it tastes like, like rotten cheese. 
[03:19:00]  Mmm.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well, who are you, who are you blowing, cabbies?  Well, apparently, some people were not taught how to clean their cocks correctly.  Yeah, but you don't understand something.  Let me just jump in and play double as an advocate.  I like having my ass eaten.  I love it.  I really do.  And I like to stick on a girl's mouth and make her lick it.  But, I'm sure every girl out there who's eating an ass would have a horror story about it.  Not with mine, you wouldn't, because I'm fucking Hank Hygiene.  I'm fucking Kenny Clean. 
[03:19:30]  You know what I want to tell you guys?  All right.  You know the person who called before and said that their kid was bleeding because they pulled  back the foreskin?  Yeah.  The foreskin naturally separates in about two years.  You're not supposed to pull back a foreskin until then.  Yeah.  Until it naturally separates.  Yeah, everyone knows that.  Of course.  What sort of shit like a snake skin?  Oh, God.  I can't even.  Imagine pulling back your dick skin and ripping the skin back.  No.  It's like taking a piece of, a corner of a piece of construction paper and poke it in  your dick hole.  Stop it. 
[03:20:00]  And slicing.  For that reason, I would make sure that if I had boys, they would have it.  I did it to all three of my boys.  Yeah, we know.  And watching it being done, I was horrified.  I couldn't believe how pain.  That toughens them up.  Hey, do they really.  It's a cool world out there.  When your boys grow up and they're receiving head, then trust me, the women will be happy  that you had it.  No, but women suck uncircumcised dicks.  Well, I'm trying not to think about that.  Well.  My son is, you know, 17. 
[03:20:30]  How big a boy is he?  He's 250 pounds and six feet tall.  That's a big one.  When was the last time you saw his penis?  What did you say?  Yeah, what did you say?  When was the last time you saw his penis, Jennifer?  I haven't seen it in about 10 years.  Oh, and you're bummed, right?  So, I really don't know what it looks like, and I don't want to know.  I want to know if any mom...  I think you're wondering just a little bit.  Are you ever curious?  Honestly, I'm not being creepy.  Are you ever curious as to how big his penis is?  Actually, I took him to the doctor and had him checked because I was afraid that maybe 
[03:21:00]  it was like a little bit on the small side.  Wait, why did you think your own son's penis might be a little on the small side?  It was just a suspicion, and I just had him checked.  How old was he?  He was about 10 years old, and he came out after getting checked, and he said, everything  went okay except for the part when he went under my underwear.  Oh, my God.  And I was like...  And then he giggled.  The doctor giggled. 
[03:21:30]  There's some things going on with Jennifer.  Wait, Jennifer, let's get to the bottom of this.  Yeah, why do you think he had a small penis?  You had a suspicion.  Why does this happen to be circumcised?  It's interesting.  This is interesting, real-life stuff.  I think her husband has a small penis, and she was wondering if her own kid has a small penis.  Why?  When kids are really overweight, it can make your penis look a lot smaller, and after  you lose the weight, you'll see that you have a regular-sized penis, and he was always  a bit on the big side.  So you had a chubby kid with a little cocktail frank dick, and how did you know this at 10 
[03:22:00]  years old?  Why were you still looking at his penis?  I wasn't looking at it.  It was just an accident.  Aren't they all small at the age of 10?  What happened?  How did you accidentally see your son's penis?  Well, my son had a habit of coming out of the shower and standing in front of the TV  and just letting the towel fall.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, of course.  I mean, no, I don't.  It was the same time that I walked in, and I was horrified, and I looked away as fast as 
[03:22:30]  possible, and I said, you know, what the hell are you doing?  Not fast enough, obviously.  The windows were all open.  So wait, he's a little exhibitionist?  He's a little dick, and he's an exhibitionist?  You know, he was young at the time.  He was an exhibitionist.  He was 10 years old, and you saw enough, you looked enough, that you said, wow, that's  a real small dick my kids got.  You did a quick math calculation.  Yeah, you really quickly assessed his penis.  Very quickly.  Very quickly.  And how long was it before you were on the phone with the doctor? 
[03:23:00]  It was quick.  I took him to, because I worked in a clinic with the doctor.  Holy shit!  You see him naked, dragging him to the doctor.  Oh, I'm such a bitch.  Oh, my God.  That's the thing I could do.  And what did the doctor say?  He said that it was fine.  He said that when a child's overweight...  Yeah, we got that part.  I thought it was something else, though.  The pubis gets fat as well.  Ew!  Old fat pubis.  Fat pubis. 
[03:23:30]  Old fat pubis.  Old fat pubis covering up the dick.  Ew!  Old fat pubis.  So she said, you know, when you milk it out, your fingers, it's a normal size.  Well, did you do that?  No, the doctor did it.  But he made me stand in the room and turn my back to her, because you're not allowed to  do that in a room alone with a child.  Wait, it was a woman doctor?  What did the woman do?  She had to squeeze the boy's fat pubis.  Wait, wait.  Did she push in on his fat pubis? 
[03:24:00]  Fatty pubis fatty.  And his little wee-wee poked out?  It's like one of those stress balls, you squeeze it in the eyes, pop out.  The eyeballs pop out.  What?  This has nothing to do with circumcision.  It was a woman doctor?  Fuck circumcision.  You're a freak.  Wow, old party favorite penis.  So the doctor had to squeeze the boy's pubis and cock to make sure it was normal size,  while the boy's mother stood in the room facing away.  Wow.  Hooker strangulations, here I come. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah, you really fucked up there, lady.  So it's a normal one in the end?  My other kids are fine, because they're normal weight.  So I don't know what, I haven't seen it, you know, but I have a six-year-old who runs around  the house, nude, before he gets into the bathtub.  Nice hog on him.  Normal.  But when the doctor circumcised him, he left a little foreskin.  So this way, you know, when he's older, his erections won't be painful, because people 
[03:25:00]  who have really tight circumcisions, they have painful erections later on in life.  See, my foreskin was cut, but they did a good job.  And actually, I got little bumps on the back where they cut, they didn't do a great job  with that, but there's enough skin where my fat cock gets rock hard.  That is a really gross mental image.  I'm getting a rod right now talking to her.  Wait, let me, mommy.  Because you're talking dirty to her.  Mommy, let me ask you, did you ever get curious, like, about how big your son's penis is now? 
[03:25:30]  Not in an incestuous way, but just curious.  No, it's not.  No, I mean, there's a natural curiosity only because I want them to be normal, and I want  them to, you know, be the effect of ridicule, you know what I mean?  So when's the last time it occurred to you where you were curious?  I mean, I know that it's not for a bad purpose.  Just, you know, because my oldest kids are 16 and 17, and I know...  Sweatpants, tight pants, did you look? 
[03:26:00]  Did you ever look just to see, like...  Look, it's sweatpants, or if they're wearing tight pants, you look and go, okay, that's  normal.  You want to?  I try not to.  But you have, though, right?  A couple times?  Like, it's pretty normal.  I can't believe we're having this.  I can't, Jimmy.  Well, no, no.  I'm just wondering if you'll...  Sit down!  I'm trying to talk to you.  Sit down, Jimmy.  I don't want to look at your eyes.  I'm not being dirty.  Mother, I'm just wondering, Mother.  Do you ever... 
[03:26:30]  What's wrong with you?  Mommy, Mommy, do you ever look...  You sit down.  Jimmy, when was the way for your mother to throw you a penis?  Oh, God.  Probably when I was, uh...  Last week.  Yeah, no, no, no.  She didn't see it.  She was blindfolded.  It's a game we play.  It's called...  It's called Earn Your Pension.  No, no, no.  It's called Measure With Your Mouth.  It's called If You Want Old Jimmy's Checks Every Month.  That's right.  It's called If You Don't Want Dog Food in Five Years.  If you had boys, you would want to make sure that they were normal because you wouldn't 
[03:27:00]  want them to be made fun of and ridiculed.  That's enough problems.  And I'm sure...  Enough about the penis!  I'm sure being told, your mother's saying your penis is too small and dragging you to  another woman to also point at it and laugh, pointing at it while you stand in the corner  like the Blair Witch Project.  And she pinches, your fat pubis.  So the little worm can poke out of the hole and say hello.  His cock looks like an apple with a worm in it.  That's what it looks like.  Old apple pubis. 
[03:27:30]  Apple pubis.  We just told him that he needed to get checked because everybody has to get their genitals  checked when they're a child.  Everybody.  Why are you so obsessed with genitals?  You are so into genitals.  That's all you think about is young boy cock and what it means to you.  I love you.  All right.  I'm here to tell you that circumcision is barbaric and it should be outlawed.  They shouldn't be allowed to do it anymore.  I saw a moyal on TV.  He got arrested because he actually sucked the... 
[03:28:00]  Yeah, well that's barbaric.  Exactly.  He'd be done in a hospital.  And he did it before the circumcision.  He had herpes on his mouth.  What?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then he gave the kid herpes and the kid died.  Right.  Oh, well.  It's not a safe thing to do.  There's more of those things.  Well, Jennifer, you should get...  What do you want us to send flowers or something?  Yeah, what kind of good parents bring their kid to a doctor who's going to suck their cock?  Well, you know, we didn't know he had anything in his mouth.  We thought he would just cut the boy's penis off and suck the blood responsibly.  You fucking idiot parents.  Those are really orthodox that do that. 
[03:28:30]  Whatever.  They're fucking savages too.  Just savage.  All right, Jennifer.  All right.  It was nice talking to you guys.  Bye, you too.  Yeah.  Sit out.  He loves the cock.  Do mothers ever wonder about their son's penises?  I'm curious.  Because you always hear about...  Mothers ever wonder about penises?  Give us a call.  You always hear about stepfathers or fathers checking out their daughter's tits.  I mean, it just happens.  But do women...  Yeah, man.  And we talked about that.  Do mothers ever wonder about their son's...  I mean, I know it sounds creepy.  And the fact that I'm, like, packing six and a half right now and filling up... 
[03:29:00]  That is really creepy.  Sit back down, Jimmy.  All right.  It's one of those, like, fucking incest stories.  Yeah.  Wait.  I have to let the air out to sit down because it's all like a heart.  Yeah.  Stacy.  You are just a disgusting machine.  You are a disgusting machine.  Anything that disgusts humanity will come out of you.  Stacy.  Normal guy.  Final word to you, Stacy.  I just...  I prefer them.  Cut. 
[03:29:30]  I mean, like I said, they're a lot cleaner and they taste a lot better.  What kind of pubis do you...  I love the word pubis.  Fat pubis.  Pubis.  Oh, Jim.  Jesus, Jim.  Wow, that was a bad one.  Thank you, Stacy.  Jennifer has issues.  She certainly does.  Fat pubis.  Her boy has a fat pubis.  Do you think that's going to be a name on Whackback?  Of course it is.  Fat pubis.  I'm sure someone has that already.  Of course they do.  Fat pubis.  Why are we making Corky sit out there? 
[03:30:00]  What?  Why are we making Corky sit out there?  Jesus, that really stunk, Jimmy.  Oh.  Why are we making Corky sit out there?  Corky hasn't been on our show in a while.  I can't see.  I can't see.  Damn, why are we making Corky sit out there?  I can't see from this angle.  Huh?  Huh?  Why won't anyone answer me?  Corky, comment.  Corky stopped by and we should have him in.  Derek, comment.  Travis, anyone?  Comment?  Comment?  No? 
[03:30:30]  Jimmy?  I don't know.  I don't know what you mean.  Maybe in a little while then.  Oh, I don't know what you mean.  I don't think I can see.  Bush.  Yes, Bush will not be saying stay the course anymore.  Is that what this is about?  That seems to be what the story is.  He's been saying stay the course, stay the course, stay the course, stay the course.  Yeah.  And now, no.  No more stay the course.  No more stay the course.  Because, see, that was his big catchphrase for the war in Iraq. 
[03:31:00]  You know, stay the course.  He wanted it to mean that we're not pulling out.  We're going to stay there until the mission is accomplished and the job is done.  But stay the course.  Because now, it's almost like his confession that the war is going poorly.  Yeah.  Because if you say stay the course, it means, oh, the way it's going now, with record numbers  of soldiers dying.  October was a bad month over there.  A real bad month.  You know, at least he finally sat down and had a meeting with the fucking generals that 
[03:31:30]  are supposed to run the war with the military.  The problem with the way this country runs its wars is the politicians, like they get involved  with every fucking other thing.  They have to be so important with what goes on in this country that when a war is started,  they have to get involved with how it's run.  Instead of letting the people that have been trained to do it, the generals and the rest  of the officers, run the fucking war.  If a general tells you, hey, we need more troops, you know what you do? 
[03:32:00]  You give them more fucking troops.  If he says, hey, we need our armor for our vehicles and our men, you give them what they  fucking need to fight the war.  You don't worry about this motherfucker.  His district has money already allocated to some fucking project and we can't get the  money for that.  It doesn't work that way.  That's the only way we win wars is by giving the generals and the officers what they need  to win the fucking war.  Well, the stay the course thing now hasn't been working because stay the course now means 
[03:32:30]  what?  Keep soldiers dying in record numbers.  So he's changed it by not really saying he's changed it, but he's saying now not stay  the course.  Different course now.  Different course.  We're now on a different course.  What the fuck?  Different course.  Is this video on YouTube?  The video's up on YouTube?  The video's on YouTube.  It's a montage of him saying stay the course.  Way to montage!  Montage!  Way to montage!  I got it here somewhere, but.  Is it a montage of stay the course? 
[03:33:00]  It's a stay the course Bush monter.  Oh, really?  Well, we got the audio.  That's exactly what I wanted to ask you about because James Baker says that he's looking for  something between cutting them and stay the course.  Listen, we've never been stay the course, George.  We will stay the course.  We will stay the course.  We will stay the course.  We will stay the course.  We're just going to stay the course.  We're going to stay the course.  We must stay the course.  We'll stay the course.  This country will stay the course. 
[03:33:30]  We will stay the course.  We will stay the course.  But we will stay the course.  Because we'll stay the course.  We'll stay the course.  Wow.  Wow.  So the beginning of that is him saying, I never said stay the course.  He goes, no, stay the course.  We're not stay the course.  Right.  Well, you've been fucking saying that since the war started.  When did he change that tune, by the way?  Very recently?  Right then and there, as you heard it.  I know, but when is that clip from?  Very recently, two days ago.  Oh, two days ago he said this, and then they followed up with the montage. 
[03:34:00]  That's exactly what I wanted to ask you about,  because James Baker says that he's looking for something between cutting run and stay the course.  Listen, we've never been stay the course, George.  We've never been stay the course.  We've never been stay the course, but then you hear a montage of just stay the course, stay the course, stay the course, stay the course, stay the course, stay the course.  We will stay the course.  We will stay the course.  We will stay the course.  We will stay the course.  We're just going to stay the course.  We're going to stay the course.  We must stay the course.  We will stay the course.  This country will stay the course. 
[03:34:30]  We will stay the course.  We will stay the course.  But we will stay the course, because we'll stay the course.  We'll stay the course.  Oh boy, D.B. from P.A. doesn't like Anthony  This is very rare, so I better read this  Very, very rare  Anthony, you voted for Bush, you dickbag  How about a little foresight next time?

Listen, man  It's unbelievable  Listen to what Obama has to say  Alright  He's got some good ideas  No, he really does  He probably is a good candidate  I just don't think he's been  He's a great speaker  He had one good fucking speech  And everyone's all over this guy  I know  I know, which was what?  About how we as Americans  At the Democratic  Or the convention 
[03:36:00]  Yes  Yeah, great speech at the convention  White people love a fucking dark fellow  Who can speak  Who can speak  Well  Like white people  We love it!  We don't like the shucking and jiving  Whitey  Whitey hates shucking and jiving  So people like Colin Powell  We love that  We love our Condi Rice talking  Oh boy, she's so well spoken  Obama  Oh, listen to him speak  He's so articulate  You know?  You don't want the shucking and jiving  I want Farrakhan  You'd better hurry 
[03:36:30]  I love him  But I hear he's not gonna be around too much longer  He's a good speaker  He don't shuck and jive  And he's well-dressed  And he's a bright guy  Alright, listen  I love him  He's a little extreme  He is, but I do like him  Where do we get that montage?

[03:42:00]  Come to their place in Detroit as a foreign exchange student  And then they had the Freudian slip of saying she'll be sharing the bed with them  How did you get hooked up in this?  I just started interest because you saw it in the paper  Whose idea was it?  Mine  You first saw it  Are you nuts?  So you saw it in the paper  And you said, this looks like something I'd like to do  Yes  And you approached your husband  Are you guys Christians?

Yeah, my parish used to do the same thing  Oh, so it's like a nice thing to do  It's a Christian thing  Yeah, yeah, yeah  You help somebody out  And they take care of  For some reason, our parish was obsessed with the Shwugi  But your parish, it's the Vietnamese  So to the wife  Now, how did you approach your husband?
