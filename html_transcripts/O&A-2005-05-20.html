<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a discussion about the unsettling imagery of near-nude men on men's underwear packaging, sparking debate about the target audience (potentially women buying for their partners) and the similar use of topless male models in Abercrombie & Fitch advertising.  A former underwear model caller described the techniques used to create the "perfect" bulge in photos, involving padding.  This transitioned into a caller's unsettling story of a near home invasion disguised as a pizza delivery, followed by Opie's recounting of a terrifying incident where a stranger entered his unlocked apartment.

The show then featured a recurring bit with "retarded Laverne and Shirley" characters (two female guests) playing movie scenes for listeners to guess.  This game continued throughout the broadcast, with scenes from *American Psycho* and *Full Metal Jacket* included alongside earlier rounds featuring *Jaws* and *Rambo: First Blood*, all resulting in comedic confusion and mockery from the hosts and callers.

A significant portion of the show focused on the discovery of a "pickled punk" (a preserved fetus) in the studio.  Mars detailed his disturbing experience with it, leading to a lengthy discussion about its origin (Andrew Gore), the perceived bad luck it brought, and the various, increasingly elaborate attempts to get rid of it.  This involved sage, robes, and even the retrieval of a buried human finger bone necklace.  Andrew Gore eventually arrived in the studio to retrieve the fetus.  John Cena (voice only) briefly promoted a restaurant, and Liddy made a short appearance.

The hosts then described their experience at Chiller Theatre/TV Expo, mentioning encounters with Lou Ferrigno (whom they missed interviewing), Tanya Harding, and other B-movie actors.  Two female guests, Katie Ketchup (who revealed a significant ketchup fetish, including a ketchup bottle tattoo) and Jungle Jim Kim (who prefers mustard), joined the show.  A substantial discussion followed concerning Kirstie Alley's "Fat Actress" and the ensuing controversy with the National Eating Disorders Association, including Rich Voss and Andy Gore (who brought more gifts including a pillow depicting elephantiasis of the scrotum and offensive novelty t-shirts, one with Adolf Hitler).  The debate centered on whether obesity should be classified as a disease, comparing it to alcoholism and drug addiction.  Andy Gore's presence also brought renewed discussion about the "pickled punk."

The show continued with a discussion on addiction, particularly alcoholism and its hereditary aspects, featuring Itch Voss and a caller, Brandy, who shared her experience with overcoming addiction.  This segued into a segment featuring absurd 911 calls â€“ one about a sibling fight leading to an inappropriate joke from the operator and another about a Burger King order.  The hosts and callers mocked the calls extensively.  News of Billy Joel's release from rehab briefly preceded the "What's Happening in Your Town" segment, which featured listeners recounting bizarre and violent local news stories, including murders, a pastor kissing a goat, and a teen bear attack.  The show then concluded.

[00:11:30]  you yearn for the day of just grabbing that fruit of the loom in that plastic bag at a duane reed or  something and just you know wear that you don't want to stand in front of a hundred boxes with  nude men on them it's men in their underwear with huge hogs and you gotta stand there and pick and  choose and you feel like you know all right what style should i get should i get the one that's cut  this way or that way and the only way you have to make that decision is to look at the guy well it 
[00:12:00]  looks hot on him you know what you don't want to have to be put in the position where you're looking  and deciding what underwear you want because it looks hot on that man no just put a picture of the  underwear on there you ever seen the invisible man you ever seen an invisible man movie yes and movie  i'm like how can you see the invisible man of course not i saw a hat once silly yes so i had just floating

[00:13:30]  again all right one last thing you guys mentioned abercami and fitch i've never been in that store  because one the pictures are appalling but two that just seems like the whitest white guy store  well well are you a white white guy um by no means we're gonna go out and buy some fubu  oh of course not but i mean like that store i mean i don't know everybody looks the same in that  store like you guys were hinting yesterday oh you you uh shop at banana republic don't you 
[00:14:00]  uh actually kind of all over the place you know like i said i'm a big guy so it's hard to find  clothes that fit you're right about abercrombie and fitch i'll take a peek they got some stuff that  other other people aren't really uh wearing that's that's what i go for i guess all right  all right we got to go back to uh all right yeah we'll do this mark from queens what's up  are you guys insane i think you guys are absolutely nuts and this whole howard hughes  uh lifestyle's gone to your head what happened to just going into target ripping off a three pack 
[00:14:30]  of fucking fruit of the womb and just walking out the door i gotta disagree with you dude  abercrombie and fitch and the gap to buy underwear you go into target one two three you're done oh my  god let me tell you something i mean going to the gap for underwear it gets a lot worse than that  i mean you know you go you do like the ralph loren or the perry ellis or and that's that that  underwear is way way up there yep i mean the gap words gentlemen and fruit of the looms i know what  see what i'm saying was i just wanted to step up uh a notch as far as my underwear went 
[00:15:00]  i didn't like fruit of the looms the material's very thin the elastic isn't very good i just wanted  a few pairs of comfy thick uh cottony underwear why not why not put some of your most valuable  items that you own your cock and balls into something a little nicer why are you spending  so much time on underwear shopping you know you're only going to wear it once i didn't and then throw 
[00:15:30]  them away then i incinerate them look jimmy's nodding dirty dirty underwear no i wear i i go i you  know they get washed and i wear them again yeah sure you do but and it's not like you threw away  a couch because it had a booger on it yes you know what's going on in your underwear i'm not not  people wiping their boogers in there it's my own stuff going on in there and they get washed  that's all i'm saying they really get washed of course they do they get bleached the bleach gets in 
[00:16:00]  there washes all the dirt away washes all the dirty memories uh all the dirty things anthony needs  everything bleached now it's gotta be bleached bleaching his hand no look i'm not saying all  i wear i'm wearing fruit of the looms right now i'm not saying all i wear these underwear but  occasionally especially if you're maybe going out and dressed nicely you want to complete the  whole thing with some very nice underwear i got go ahead jimmy fruit of the looms are awful and people 
[00:16:30]  have to start realizing thank you jimmy they look like diapers and i'm sorry but you have to  understand folks we're fancy people get used to it we're fancy people fancy fancy what a lame word  i gotta tell you something i am fancy i thought this was like just a throwaway subject the phones  have exploded because i've hit a nerve they've absolutely exploded let's go to christina long  christine hi guys i want to see you guys are complaining because for what maybe two years 
[00:17:00]  you have to look at half naked men in advertising when women have been doing it for like 30  oh you think i want to look at a woman bouncing around in a bikini to splash soda  yeah but that's hot and and all girls have that lesbian thing in them right girls don't mind as much  looking at nude or semi-nude girls i totally agree with anthony there's something going on with you  girls you guys could get naked together you could get you yeah yeah you kiss your girlfriends when  you're out right drinking and stuff and me and opie barely ever kissed  i guess this is the new trend though in uh advertising is to get uh get the guys uh uh with less clothes on 
[00:17:30]  yeah yeah and that's supposed to sell to guys well it's trying to show guys like you'll look  like this in this which is unrealistic it is no first of all you got to be delusional to think you  can ever attain that look it they're models they're paid huge amounts of money to look like that 
[00:18:00]  and it's genetics and and uh the gay lifestyle and the gym you want to see someone that looks hot  and underpants get a copy of yellow discipline that's right there you go now you're talking  the average joe i was at that photo shoot i've never laughed harder there was this really really  hot photographer put that on the calvin klein box oh my god this really hot photographer that had all  these great ideas for jim norton's yellow discipline cd yellow roses and and got him like a kind of like 
[00:18:30]  a james bond type like a suit coat suit to wear and yeah and uh and so jimmy goes back behind the  curtain to change and he comes walking out with just his underpants on pulled as high as he possibly can  his gut at the time just awful just overtaking all the underwear so all that's just sticking out  of course and he's basically going i'm ready here's what i want to do  and the picture's up on uh i guess it's up on your websites right somewhere yeah yeah go to eatabullet.com 
[00:19:00]  somewhere i don't know how young young almost completely nude men are selling to other men  how the average guy that wants to walk in and get dressed buy some clothes is is making a decision  based on these nude men that's so i don't get it you nailed it it's funny and you have to deal with  now matt from jersey what's up how's it going guys hey i didn't want to say you're right about 
[00:19:30]  abercrombie not only is it the guys on the wall that are shirtless but then you get the stuff from  the store and the bag they give you usually has two shirtless guys playing volleyball with each  other and then you got to walk through the mall it's awful and you catch like a glimpse of yourself  in the mirror oh my god i forgot about the bag now you have to walk through the mall with the bag  with gay porn on it that's hilarious you can't even put it in the bag and get away yeah cause do those 
[00:20:00]  two guys really want to be playing volleyball yeah running into the ocean with a surfboard and then  you got to look like that as you walk through the mall you should just be walking around with a bag  with a picture of a guy sucking another man's cock on it yeah just did some shopping well you see the  new bag they have now where there's not there's not two guys anymore there's only one and he's  walking out of st vincent's with a tear on his face jesus you're just an awful human being you  really are oh christ let's go to rooster the trucker rooster hey guys how you doing hey good hey first 
[00:20:30]  of all i'd like to say uh... it's so refreshing having uh... you guys on the air and powered man cow they  suck anyway uh... it's bad enough going into a mall and seeing uh... pictures of guys but uh... i was in  a mall in chicago and they have half nude live models on the floor men and women yeah that's what you 
[00:21:00]  need that's gonna sell that really sucks when you walk with your lady past some guy standing right there  with his underwear hanging out you know i know nothing about marketing or anything like this but  as far as uh... men's underwear goes i bet you they would sell a lot more if they made these boxes less  provocative with the uh... the men on them i bet because there are guys believe me there are guys  that will not buy them because they will not walk up to that that that display and pick up a box with 
[00:21:30]  this naked guy on it and with his huge hog in his underwear there are guys that will not do it just  for that reason well someone is uh... that was a good point someone was saying that they hung up that  they're they're actually marketing this stuff for the girlfriends and the wives is that what it is  because maybe they're the ones doing a lot of the shopping doing the shopping yeah well i must say  that uh... i always started with me and she's the one i made her take the boxes of underwear off the 
[00:22:00]  shelf and bring them up to the register i did not want to hold these and carry them around the  store that's a good point i bet you that's what they're going for the girls are out there doing  all the shopping and taking how much underwear do the girls buy for men like is it more are more  girls buying their underwear for men or do more men buy their own underwear dude because that that  then that would make sense i only started buying clothes for myself two years ago you still  i know me so me too so you know that that person might be onto something there scott from jersey 
[00:22:30]  what's up my mother would buy me the under two seconds scott my mother would buy me uh the designer  underwear for christmas right so i would open up the present at grandma's house when we all get  together on christmas eve and it was embarrassing there too because i open it up and i'm like oh and  i gotta pick up this box there's a guy with a huge hog on it and like thanks mom yeah thanks for  the man with the huge hog picture anthony show everyone what you got i got this picture  ka-ching ka-ching ka-ching yeah gay pornography mommy got me gay pornography scott from jersey what's up 
[00:23:00]  hey guys uh for about six months between uh high school and college i actually was a uh i was an  underwear model for uh j crew yeah great thanks uh now you guys gotta be think about one of these photo  shoots now when you're talking about the armadillo in the front of the guy's pants first of all if you  think about what you look like when you're just wearing underwear it doesn't look quite as round i  mean there's some hills and valleys in there so they actually place little pieces in there to make 
[00:23:30]  it perfectly round not a full piece but so you got the uh gi joe or the ken doll kind of bulge going but  no real distinction of balls or what is it some kind of like a like a cup almost no it's like an epoxy  like it's like a it so it's perfectly rounded but it's not like hard it's almost like a gibbs  because it's got to look a little like like skin and then think about me i'm standing there and you  got this guy who's undoubtedly gay who's shoving this stuff around my junk holding tickle around 
[00:24:00]  i mean because i don't do it myself they have to mold it perfectly like they were doing a sculpture  it's obscene yeah it's so you guys buy it but it is marketed towards girls it's not marketed  towards guys i'm heterosexual male i like to say that on the air you better say that if you're  yeah disgusting oh whatever all right scott thank you punch it out bye a lot of times i'll go to  the store like abercrombie or something like that and i'll see the clothes the guys with those shirts  and i think like i want to look like that because the girls will like me better sure because i kind 
[00:24:30]  of i want to look like ashton let's say hi to that body without the shirt you want to play volleyball  i want the hair like that and stuff it's cool derek from kentucky what's up what's up man hey  hey ope i gotta call you out on something yeah go ahead uh let's see you've been getting on ant  about uh shopping buying all these nice clothes because he's changing what's up with you shopping  at the gap for underwear all of a sudden are you going here to look at the gay guys or what the  hell's going on um no i take a peek at the gap every once in a while i needed some underwear i went 
[00:25:00]  over there honestly i don't remember seeing any of these uh pictures that anthony is discussing and  at the gap it might be there i'm not i'm not sure but i'd deny it too no you can see him anywhere  dude you can see it in macy's it's a freaking macy's you go in there and they have the underwear  section and they're just loaded with these boxes and every designer box has the the the gay guy with  a huge hog on it every single one it's amazing that ant seems to know all these gay guys hang out

[00:27:30]  this was the time that someone was ringing my my buzzer at 11 30 at night which to me is the middle  middle of the night when you're getting up to do a course a morning radio show and uh it was quite  scary there was he had ulterior motives yeah there was an intimidating uh black fellow with a pizza box  a delivery man well i don't know if he was a delivery man did he cook the pizza  it was a little scary though take a listen it's the worst of opie and anthony 
[00:28:00]  lo mas mal de opie en anthony en xm2 cero dos  anyway uh last night i go to bed real real early because you know we had the atlantic city weekend  and stuff and i'm in bed around nine i've been i've been staying up a lot later with these new hours  have you yeah it's been nice it's been working out well i don't stutter and uh fumble around with my  words as much i'm getting a good night's sleep but uh so i'm sleeping for a good two to three hours 
[00:28:30]  all right and also my buzzer and  over and over again and i'm in such a deep sleep i'm thinking my alarm clock's going off i can't  figure out what the noise is and i finally uh wake up sounds fine on the air to me okay you could just  grab a mic and say that i don't miss that apartment living huh i don't miss that apartment living i  remember that man man oh so maybe uh i might have to talk to the nyp uh the nypd after the show 
[00:29:00]  today is all i'm thinking really yeah the more i think about it scam so uh yeah ben is with me he  thinks scam so uh the buzzer's going off like crazy and i finally like realize it's my you know my buzzer  and i stagger stagger upstairs my two-level abode oh oh it's just a basement relax so um so then i hit  the uh you know the talk thing i'm like yeah what do you want those things work so well 
[00:29:30]  yeah what do you want  what he either said fedex or i'm going to murder you what what  i'm going to have a package i'm going to kill you wait you have a package for me or you're going to  kill me  i don't care about that i'm going to murder a fucking knife  what  so understand a word they say through those well here's the problem i'm hitting talk like yeah  what do you want something like that and all i hear is 
[00:30:00]  he's not he's not hitting the talk button back on the intercom just yelling and but i could hear  him outside okay and he's trying to tell me that there's some kind of delivery or whatever delivery  like food delivery that's all i can understand did you hear the voice uh yeah very well could you  imitate maybe what he sounded like did you order a motherfucking pizza  was it like that well maybe could you put a little inflection on it to imitate maybe what 
[00:30:30]  the voice sounded like everyone knows i don't do a lot of voices on this program so i will write  i will write what kind of uh gentleman this was and then maybe you can help me out  oh just based on on n  oh okay all right something on the paper that now completely explains so he  was there but he's not pushing the talk button and now i'm thinking now now i'm thinking now 
[00:31:00]  that i'm wide awake that this is part of the scam probably uh-huh so uh so i i keep pushing the  button what do you want because i was woken up from a deep deep sleep right sleep right and and i could  hear outside the window that he's telling me in this in this voice that there's voice some kind of  delivery right some kind of i think pizza delivery okay  yeah god pizza pie motherfucker  did it sound something like that uh yeah similar sure yeah i got some delivery 
[00:31:30]  is it something something to that effect yeah something similar all right so  so again hitting trying to get this guy to talk to the intercom what what do you want i didn't order  anything and he's he's insisting that i order this uh this pizza all so now i'm like god i can't hear  the guy through the intercom so now i leave you can now i leave my apartment see here's where you get  really stupid now i leave my apartment here's where no matter where you live now it is completely 
[00:32:00]  understandable that you grew up on long island right so because you shouldn't have gone out  now here's the confusion um it turned out it was only 11 30 at night but because i was in bed and out  cold i really didn't know what time it was and in my stupid brain i thought it was the middle of the  night do you think a cowboy at a fort years ago hearing would open the main gate and go outside  do you really think so no you stay in you send some uh guys up to the towers with guns and you protect 
[00:32:30]  yourself within your fortress so i leave my apartment and go to the front door which is double  doors and it's relatively safe you know considering okay uh and he's inside the first door and he's  just looking at the second through the second window yeah right at me and this guy was one of the scariest  mofos i've ever seen in my life but he had your pizza carrying a domino's pizza box uh the warm bags i 
[00:33:00]  don't know what the fuck was in that oh geez this guy had gold two faces yeah he had domino's pizza  with glock topping he had gold teeth he looked like he stepped right out of one of these rap videos  okay no no that's not even true because now all the rap videos they're all polished and nice yeah and  this guy old school this was old school scary looking dude with a domino's you know bag with pizza  trying to convince me that i ordered the pizza maybe you didn't you forgot and i'm like look and 
[00:33:30]  now we're yelling through the glass i'm like i didn't order the you know the pizza he's like no  you ordered the pizza and then he's giving my address he goes yeah see you ordered the pizza it's  right on the box your address you ordered this man just just open the door we'll talk about this  we can talk about this if you open the door i don't think so and then he's getting scared of you  sir yeah exactly i'm scared i'm scared of you this is this is me talking through the glass i'm scared 
[00:34:00]  of you sir and i'm protecting myself i am protecting myself i am scared of you please follow the police  so he's he's really trying to convince me to open up the the final door anthony you don't want to  hire niggas that's all the final door now let me just explain to get to me you have to go through  four locked doors four locked doors it's down to three are all open and ready to go oh boy there's  only one to go one safety door left this now it all makes sense to me you know this morning with 
[00:34:30]  a clear head uh-huh so he's like he's trying to get me to open that final door to try to figure out  this pizza situation yep showing me the address right on the box i had to order there's my address  what's in the box this is what i wanted to tell him you're a phony hey this guy's a great big phony  hey you're a great big phony you know that that's right you're a big fat phony taunt him through the 
[00:35:00]  glass now what if some uh resident of the building would have come up at that point and and open the  door to get in that would have been a sticky situation well then well then there's you know two of  us so i don't know remember when uh noonan was in the cage and denunzio walked up and he wouldn't  give him the coke then you get a no coke huh and he's making fun of him calls him a jerk and the head  of the caddy uh shack came in opened it up and told him to get out and then there was that thing would  have happened to you fight with the bloody knife no bare feet so this guy is just kind of throwing his 
[00:35:30]  arms up and down and he's getting really pissed off and like you know just screaming through the glass  i didn't order the pizza man you know and then he finally he gave it he gave it a really good try  and then he finally left and then i went back to you know my apartment just kind of freaked out about  the whole situation and then all night long just kind of listening with half an ear like wondering if  he's coming back and all that and then when i was and then when i left this morning i was too i was 
[00:36:00]  kind of scared to leave the place yeah i definitely was because i didn't know what the hell that was all  about well not in the morning yeah like he was hanging out there dude i don't leave one of those  i don't want to somebody else let me explain something jimmy when i leave my apartment it's  still dark i know when you get here the sun is uh shining nice and high there's a big difference  when we leave our apartment no no no i know that but do you understand six hours later you're still  there with pizza who knows don't do you understand things are scarier at night yes you know you get here 
[00:36:30]  it's bright sunshine you have to put sunscreen on when aunt and i get to work and get sunscreen  when we get to work and start you know preparing for the show it's still pitch dark you just start  hearing the birds a little bit just a little bit because they're waking up with you  so what do you think uh this could have been uh a home invasion do you think it could have been a  legitimate mistake or a setup well no joke the guy was scary it sounds a lot of the delivery guys are  scary yeah but it sounds like it could have been a mistake but you don't know better to air on the 
[00:37:00]  side of safety and not what we you didn't want to pizza so you don't let him in anyway right the fact  that he's ringing your buzzer i used to love the guys that would come to deliver and just smash a  hand two hands over all the buzzers just so they could get in the door and some idiot just man buzzes  him in you know the whole security system falls apart because there's one idiot one idiot in your  building just man i don't care right i'll hit the rape rob kill button over here and let him in 
[00:37:30]  right it's there for a reason you jackass but if you let him in uh then he comes to your door and  knocks you open that door kick it in that's all invasion that's what i'm thinking and hopefully he's  just there for your property that's what i'm thinking oh maybe he's a big guy maybe he just  intimidates you into paying him for the pizza that you didn't order he's upper west side you know uh  white people would be scared of him and he correct me oh maybe look man i got this pizza  he walks around with like one pizza well you know i've told the story a bunch of times on the radio 
[00:38:00]  but i i i'm pretty you know safe because of what happened in buffalo what the famous story in buffalo  well which one was that you remember the famous story in buffalo and when i was working oh i do now  all that's creepy dudes what i'm about got your victim of the new listeners for for what i'm about  to tell you is no radio exaggeration this is exactly how it happened what you're about to hear is shocking 
[00:38:30]  this is exact okay i was i was doing overnights in uh buffalo and so i was sleeping a lot of days and  stuff blah blah blah i was in this brownstone that had you know in a crappy neighborhood north pearl  street which was like there was a lot of happy neighborhood buffalo yeah well it was like a lot  of heroin addicts a lot of druggies you know i wasn't making much money in the buffalo and my  apartment was very close to the station so it was convenient but it was a safe building you had to  get through two doors and then your apartment door to get to you know to get to the person okay right 
[00:39:00]  and uh opie is a should have called dominoes eric from miami i was too tired went back to bed yeah  keep the door locked go to sleep and uh you know and then just wonder all night that's all yeah  anyway so i'm in buffalo and um it was a brownstone and yeah the front two doors were always locked but  um i didn't i didn't lock my door for for some stupid reason i have no idea to this day why i have  no idea it was just dumb you know i was like on the fourth floor in the back i figured i don't know 
[00:39:30]  i just did it it's insanity so uh asking for it around this time in buffalo there was a uh a rapist  that they were very very concerned about a black rapist swear to god very very concerned about they  did some stories on the news you know he raped here he raped there he raped here blah blah oh no  so uh so i'm sleeping on a i think it was a saturday or sunday in the middle of the day right 
[00:40:00]  and uh some idiots in the building like anthony was just talking about they were moving out so  they didn't want to be inconvenienced so they propped open both the bottom doors and why not  so they're getting a load from upstairs and they they have the bottom doors propped so they could  get it into their station wagons and stuff it was it was one of those cheap moves where you get all  your friends and you try to get it all in a couple of cars you know the only problem is we lived in a  really bad neighborhood so this was uh you know gave somebody the opportunity to sneak in while 
[00:40:30]  you're going back upstairs uh to get more stuff right so this is all i remember i'm out cold  laying on my side and i wake up because i guess i feel a presence in my room oh this is the god's  honest truth man i open my eyes to see a black guy in a hooded sweatshirt with the hood you know  pulled down really tight around his head staring at me two to three inches away from my face did you go 
[00:41:00]  my heart was in my throat of course and i opened up my eyes until his cock pushed it out  i opened up my eyes and uh and the only thing i can say is uh uh what are you doing here oh that's  a good one well what else are you gonna do how many times has he heard that before i was like well 
[00:41:30]  i'm like what are you doing here and i had long hair back then you know i was doing the rock thing  we oh my god what you were almost raped yeah that's what he's getting at jimmy oh my god  all right wow way to wake up you all right yeah oh yeah guys right there in the room well this is  this is what yeah i i could figure out uh what happened here so he's you know very close to my 
[00:42:00]  face i open my eyes i go what are you doing here i didn't know what to do you're not gonna i didn't  i wasn't gonna make the first move i didn't know what you know i was waiting to see what the hell  this is all about and obviously it couldn't be good why else would he be no it couldn't be good  why else would he be in my room you know he didn't even have a pizza box so i open my eyes  i go what are you doing here he looks at me i look at him and then he jumps up and bolts and runs out  of my apartment i'm like oh my god oh my god i jump out of bed like holy crap what the f and i remember  um i had some kind of like uh metal you know shelves whatever right inside my apartment where i always 
[00:42:30]  just threw my keys in my wallet when i came in just like dump that you know whatever and i'm i'm away  from home and all that crap so i'm thinking right away now i'm thinking oh my god oh my god  you know nothing's gonna happen to me but what the fuck did he you know take from my apartment uh-huh so  i jump out of bed because i hear the front door kind of you know slam uh closed again or whatever  and i run and my wallet and my keys are missing so but fast forward a little bit turns out i found them 
[00:43:00]  it was in my jeans or something i i just didn't put them you know there okay um he runs out he didn't  take anything from my apartment is the key to the story so now you know thinking about everything  that went on that day i'm thinking he was looking to rape again yes and he saw this opportunity you  know this this brownstone is wide open because these people are leaving blonde haired girl laying in bed  exactly so he he goes into this apartment starts you know trying for doors that are unlocked bingo mine's 
[00:43:30]  unlocked he goes in you know carefully you know it sneaks into the bedroom sees me maybe with my  longer long hair on the pillow i don't know it's flowing and now he's looking now he's looking you  know real close to see if i'm a chick or not that's the only thing i could think of man good thing you  said something he might have plastered your face in the pillow and still not knowing you're a guy just  thrusted up your ass oh can you imagine do you know how close you came yeah that was that what if 
[00:44:00]  the guy didn't care guy or girl true wow that was the scariest moment of my life right there oh the  scariest moment of my life so and then i was able to like run out of the building to see him sprinting  down the road yeah and that was the last i ever saw the dude obviously so oh the last you ever saw of  him do you miss him he never even came back thing hard to get that was going through my mind last night  with this weird dominoes experience man yeah i wouldn't even now yeah i wouldn't even have left 
[00:44:30]  the apartment like what who no no pizza go away well he kept he kept bringing the buzzer over and over  again it was getting you know obnoxious stop ringing the buzzer call the cops there's a man there's a  negro at my door i don't know what to do when a negro comes to my door joe from jersey what's up  hey good morning guys oh come on man splurge the extra money and go for this there's a high 
[00:45:00]  class apartment with the concierge there to keep those guys out uh yeah well norton's like it's  time to get a in a building with a doorman all right take it easy punch it out all right thank you  and let's go to angelo in brooklyn angelo hey listen uh i love the show guys got news for you it's  gotta be a scam dominoes takes your number when you place the order and i've had it happen if they  can't get you to the door they'll call your phone no really for your phone absolutely had it happen  repeatedly huh well what was going to happen you think the guy was just going to roll me for home 
[00:45:30]  invasion yeah it was looking probably for a home invasion or just maybe just want the 20 bucks  all right look take this pizza give me 20 bucks yeah right right all right thank you buddy  go over pizza guy steal his pizza and then you go and sell it all right we have audio of the uh  black guy that uh walked into your apartment in buffalo yeah after uh opie woke up  hey where are the white women at  that is harsh man all right uh matt from long island hey did you run and hide in your panic room 
[00:46:00]  yeah you need a panic room all right well man that is a that's a frightening story that buffalo one  yeah that one is uh that one's the real deal man that was just uh did you start keeping a weapon by  the bed or something after that no locked your door i just uh oh yeah yeah oh yeah i've never on  kept my door unlocked since then i have weapons anyone have weapons in their house you got any weapons no 
[00:46:30]  no jim no well you'd probably use them on yourself in some throes of depression believe me that's the  only reason i don't own a pistol i don't own a pistol it's a lot easier than jumping out a window or  something yeah just one second i don't think we want to admit to what weapons we have i know i  understand i'm just saying if anybody needs you know a protection it's you know somebody that's opening  up their doors for pizza delivery guys you know how much of a pain in the ass it is to get a gun the real 
[00:47:00]  way ah well yeah i have a weapon but it's a slow acting weapon and it's in the bottom of my balls  but this guy hangs around for six months to a year or two  freeze anyway why don't we take a break anthony all right we're just getting started i want to  congratulate jim norton he had a great great show at atlantic city at the bar gotta oh thank you uh  had a lot of fun got remind me about uh the gambling experience with joey joey paisano of mulberry

[00:53:30]  no that's not even a good one because he chooses not to have hair we've both been like if he was  bald then you might be onto something but he just chooses to shave his head I think it's something to  tell him because all the other fellas shave their head like that right we've both been lacking the  gym all week I only went once this week really well I had I had a lot of appointments I had to keep  this week so on your planet how long is a week in our time yeah exactly uh now I see you're wearing  I see you're wearing a Jim Norton t-shirt though you can bitch and uh complain about him all you want 
[00:54:00]  but you're wearing his shirt and she's so fat it's actual size and you're always online with  him too so you're online with him at least once every two weeks all right listen I talked to him  once in a while all right can we play the uh the movie game it was such a great success last time we  did it open shut up as you recall we gave you your time now you gotta listen a little bit lady dying  marion uh will be given scripts yep to famous scenes from famous guy movies right they will then 
[00:54:30]  uh go back and forth with the dialogue from the movie and we will go to a lucky caller on our screen  right and that caller must uh figure out what movie that scene is from based solely on their  what is going to be an academy award-winning performance right of that scene you know guys  you know marlon brando whistles clearer than you speak hey i don't know how to whistle that good do  you okay we're ready to play come back marion well you know all right now now look look i i got i 
[00:55:00]  gotta be i already see a problem with this is this the same one they have now why did you print this  because they're going to read this and ruin the whole game yeah you did do not read anything that  his cross that do not mean anything that may quimp down we got you anthony we won't do that now when  you when you look at the paper don't mumble on don't read a thing aloud you guys are crazy you know  they're going to mess it up anyway i know i try shut up we got billy from oceanside what's up billy 
[00:55:30]  what's up guys ready to play the movie game yep all right listen closely to this scene that will be  enacted by these two and uh try to figure out what the movie is now uh marion you will be playing the  part uh that starts first don't say it don't mouth it don't say it and uh lady die you're playing  the second one you see that don't say it now uh start your scene um when we say action 
[00:56:00]  and billy you know what you're doing right yeah no problem okay all right let's go ladies go ahead  all right go you like ewe lewis in the news they're okay the early work was a little too new  way for my god cut cut uh marion marion hello if i could ask you please play it up a little more  you're just reading it very monotone you were acting last time what is your face out of the page  as they say you're acting you're acting have a connection with the other actor all right 
[00:56:30]  this let me just say without giving anything away your performance as you read this these lines  you should be very analytical very very into what you're saying yeah be very into what you're  passionate passionate about what you're talking about you should have a little passion for what  you're talking about because you're built like gamma you don't have to read like him  built like king kong oh she understood the movie monster though she got right  godzilla movies very good marion okay take two take two quiet on the set and action 
[00:57:00]  you're like ewe lewis in the news they're okay their early work was too new way for my taste but when  sports came out in 83 i think they really came into their own commercially and artistically the whole  album has a clear crisp sound and a new sheen of kind of consummate professionalism that really gives  uh songs a big boost he's been compared to elvis costello but i think he has a far more bitter  cynical sense of humor hey yes alan why are there copies of the style section all over the place 
[00:57:30]  you have a dog a little chow or something no alan  is that a raincoat yes it is in 87 ewe lewis released this released this for their most  accomplished album i think their undisputed masterpiece is hip to be square a song so catchy  most people probably don't listen to their lyrics but they should because it's not just about the 
[00:58:00]  pleasure to comfort me and the importance of friends it's also a personal statement about the  band itself hey paul ah they're getting your reservations at dorcia now you effing selfish  bastard you effing selfish bastard you girls are passionate there it is i'm glad she took my uh  advice and read it with a little more passion you did nothing you did not emote anything emotional  range of an autistic that was horrible you should drive the car slow on saturdays you didn't sound 
[00:58:30]  into what you were saying you were again just reading i didn't disagree and i don't disagree  i think it was awful i thought she asked me about that one well no because the whole thing is you  doing all right she showed me and um uh billy from motions i what movie were they uh acting out  don't you stare at it eat it american cycle oh american cycle with uh marion playing of course  uh bateman they don't even know the movie jesus hold on the line they're gonna get your info 
[00:59:00]  it's about a guy who found find you attractive i like the way she did what about a woman i could  find hey paul ah what's the women stupid all right hold on hold on go ahead did you like the part  where she went hey paul ah you're getting your resume it's like no it's like hey paul and then ah  the guy he's killing him at that point yeah he's screaming as he's acting i don't know how to get  into the acting all right listen shut up so we have a reference point this is the scene you like 
[00:59:30]  huey lewis and the news they're okay their early work was a little too new wave for my taste when sports  came out in 83 i think they really came into their own commercially and artistically the whole album  has a clear crisp sound and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a  big boost he's been compared to elvis costello but i think huey has a far more bitter cynical sense of 
[01:00:00]  humor oh yeah we're just trying yes alan why are there copies of the style section of the play do you  give a dog a little chow or something no alan is that a raincoat yes it is  in 87 huey released this for the most accomplished album i think their undisputed masterpiece is hip to  be square a song so catchy most people probably don't listen to the lyrics but they should because 
[01:00:30]  it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of friends it's also a personal  statement about the band itself  god damn what a movie i think the ladies nailed that i think you guys hit it on the head now that 
[01:01:00]  i listen back you nailed it you did very well man you hit it on the head that the game was being a  little too harsh in the news i had forgotten what the actual scene sounded like opie so now hearing  it you guys nailed it you got you guys were right on okay problem thank you is that not one of the  best scenes in any movie ever i can't get enough of that movie why you look all right shut up we've 
[01:01:30]  talked about mr book we're running out of time though and this this game is too priceless this is this  game's too close to my heart i like this game all right now i want to exploit it to its fullest potential  keep your mouth shut don't read a thing till we tell you and just read what we are from philly  you want to play the movie game you know it all right cool all you have to do is listen to these uh  two uh lovely ladies who are whales act out a scene from a uh a very popular movie and if you guessed

[01:24:00]  and he was in the back office  and uh  he found it  he  started really freaking out  cause he didn't know  what the hell it was  uh huh  called washington  the fbi  lawyers  it was  it was a mess  building security  it was a pretty interesting story  interesting enough  to throw it on our stupid radio  then he opens the jar up  and touches it  yes  you remember he touched it  and the whole  the big bill  we're back  and eventually on a later episode  he did come back 
[01:24:30]  and take the pickled punk  but not during this one  right  well the next segment  will be Andrew Gore  oh picking up the punk  okay  oh  well we'll introduce that  at the proper time  okay yeah  not right now  ours finds the pickled punk  and touches it  the worst  of opie and anthony  yeah  awful  all right  uh  we gotta get danny in here  danny  i see you let the head roll a little  a little bit  what do you do during it  it's like boss's awful jew hair  it's not bad  you work 
[01:25:00]  yeah these guys work  these guys work for free  while they enjoyed the uh  damn you didn't go on a cruise  the two week vacation  nope  came here a couple of days  i was helping ziggy out  with the store  dude i'm walking the beach  trying to  you know figure out  if i should start smoking pot again  i'm searching out  the coconut man every day  i'm dining with the captain  and these  for free  working for free  back in new york  on a slaves  very good  well there was a controversy 
[01:25:30]  yes  yes danny  what happened  the fbi was almost involved  pretty much  apparently  uh you guys know mar  here  uh he wanted to tell me a story  uh he said it was pretty funny  so he was telling me  that somebody had moved  a box that was in here  into the room in the back  and uh  it was uh  yeah into one of our offices  that we don't use  all right  one of the offices  that we demanded from xm  we demanded that they build  all these offices  well we have an office  but me and opie 
[01:26:00]  needed another office  that's right  uh  so we demanded  we have an office  with just two desks in it  for us to get away  from the riffraff  and you know  if you listen to this program  we make it sound like  there's no one else  in this facility  it's all about  anthony and i  and jim norn of course  and uh  you know  they had to make a lot of space  for the opie and anthony show  here in new york  and it was a small space  to begin with  and uh  that wasn't good enough for us  we're like no  we need uh  we need to take over  the entire conference room  we need  we need the whole kitchen area  as our private offices  we need  need  need 
[01:26:30]  need  build  build  build  or we're not coming  right  so then the rest of the gang  had to be shoved into  tiny little cubicles  their  their space that was small  to begin with  got smaller  now the  area where the coffee machine  and everything was  now it takes up like  a two foot spot  on a shelf  pretty much  their lunch room  so they build these  really nice offices  so aunt and i could get away  we haven't used them once  so i guess a box from the studio  has moved into one of these offices  you got it  and uh...  mars was kind of curious 
[01:27:00]  of what was in the box  because it was kind of bulging  on the side  what's in the box  tell me what's in the box  don't we have that somewhere  no i think  i think you think that somewhere  we should get it though  no we had it  i played it once  all right go ahead  so mars  mars opens the box  and sure enough  inside is the pickled punk  oh  the pickled  punk  no  where do we get that from  uh...  andrew gore  and i  andrew gore  and i  i openly admitted that 
[01:27:30]  it  has brought me bad luck  for the two and a half years  uh... that he gave it to me  he gave it to me like two and a half years ago  and there's been some weird things  that have happened  it's like the great brady tiki  and i'm thinking  that you wear it around your neck  and i was thinking it was in my closet  in my uh... new york apartment  i'm thinking you know  who knows  maybe it would be smart  to just give it back to the guy  and maybe  maybe it will help my luck  maybe  it is taboo  maybe it will help my luck  taboo  so i brought it back in here  because he was supposed to be in uh... 
[01:28:00]  new york to  do pitch  does everyone know what a pickled punk is  i don't know if all our listeners know  it's from an old circus term  it's uh... yeah  it's from the old side shows  you would pay your dollar  or back then  what was it a quarter  or a nickel  it was like a nickel or something  yeah a nickel  and you'd go in and see these  they're  deformed fetuses  you know  maybe spontaneous  uh...  spontaneous miscarriage  or something like that  or what  did they  did they have abortions back then  who knows  how did they get these things  they give them cute names and stuff 
[01:28:30]  two headed  yeah they'll have two heads  and three legs  they'll just be so deformed  they'll look like lizard baby  or something  yeah the lion head boy  things like that  yeah lion head boy  and it's really disgusting  so uh...  andrew gave one to opie  because i had a fascination about it  had a fascination with it  and was asking for one  and got one  and in andrew's old crib  and thank god he  finally moved  so if the fbi wants to  question me  i have no idea where he lives now  uh-huh  he had  a display in this old joint  that was just unbelievable  yeah 
[01:29:00]  we've talked about the siamese babies  with the diapers on them  yeah little diapers on them  in a fish tank  and uh...  these things were so old  they had like really  really old locks on them  and stuff  from the original owners  and stuff  these things have been  passed down  you know  generations  yeah  pickled punk  very funny name  yeah  yeah  dead  peters  yeah  so he finally gave me one  it's a little present  little pickled peters  well that's where  this gets interesting  by the way  oh jesus  so you found it was  bringing you bad luck  as you had it hanging 
[01:29:30]  around your neck  when you went surfing  so i thought it  it couldn't hurt  to bring it back  and give it back  to the owner  take it back  so it's been just  kind of laying around  it's been a ton of  they give you directions  to the cave  right  and then what happened  with tiki  your TV dad  took it and wore it  around his waist  and  well i had a discussion  i had a discussion  with vincent price  and uh  yeah vincent price 
[01:30:00]  he was in that episode  we all went to a luau  i do nothing wrong  let's do nothing wrong  so um  it is taboo  so we brought it  i brought it back in  yeah  and it ended up in a box  because no one really  wanted to look at it  and then  you know  this place is kind of  cluttered  and it was just  forgotten about  yeah i definitely  did not want to  uh  look at that thing  anymore  so the box  uh  was moved to this office  that anthony and i  don't use  and then what happens  sorry danny  getting back to you  finally  that's alright  so mars opens it up 
[01:30:30]  sees that it's a  indeed a fetus in a jar  and doesn't remember  that you had brought this  in and spoke about it  on the air  fetus in a jar  so he proceeds to  freak out  and uh  grabs poe  and brings him in  to ask him  poe wrestled it  to the ground  real if it's fake  they're freaking out  poe wants to call  the police  and uh  oh my god  so yeah  so mars finds us  in the back office  because he had to go  get something  and he looks into the box  and there's the pickled punk  and yeah  did they ever hear us  talking about this thing  that's why i'm surprised 
[01:31:00]  so then master poe got involved  and then bruce who runs  the new york facility  got involved  and they're all just  staring at it  master poe put a little  gee on it  taught it a few kicks  so then what happened  there danny  well apparently  some calls were made  down to washington  oh jesus  oh boy  here we go again  that's all  washington needs  now with phone calls  oh what's the problem  equipment thing  no there seems to be  a fetus here  in a jar  in a mayonnaise jar  looks like it might have  been born this week  great 
[01:31:30]  oh boy  and no one could figure out  if it was real or fake  and mars decided that  he just had to find out  for himself  no way  yep  are you kidding  put on a glove  cracked it open  and started poking it  why would you open that  that hasn't been opened  in decades  yeah  probably 90 years  if you look at it  it looks like it's plastic  yeah so  so he poked it  and realized it is real  indeed it was  well he was telling me 
[01:32:00]  that uh... the night before  he was in bed  what did it feel like  and he was just  he couldn't fall asleep  oh my god  my puke  oh  oh it just hit me  oh what did it feel like  oh my god  like a raw chicken leg  dude look at my arm  where it kind of skin moves  around a little on the bone  yeah  it takes a lot to get me  skeeved  i just  i just like  wow  that was the beginnings  of a puke  that is really bad  he was telling me  the night before  he was just thinking about  whether it was  fake or not  and he just could not  fall asleep  and he was just saying  to himself  all right tomorrow  i'm just gonna go in  i'm just gonna have to  i gotta touch it 
[01:32:30]  you will be molested  you will be molested  you gotta touch it  yeah  so he's poking at it  yeah if we want  i guess we could ask him  what it felt like  if you guys want to know  what does a pickled punk  feel like  i just like the way  danny tried to direct  the show  i kinda like that  yeah  guys get him in here  bring him right in  it's a good point  all the other interns  laughing  they revel in others  failure  he hasn't seen ben  in three hours  he figured what the hell  i'll give it a shot  i like the fact that 
[01:33:00]  young danny and his new  carmine ragusa hair  so what'd you do  when he found the  pickled punk  that you slide on the  floor and sing  rags to riches  wow  marge is in the studio  how you doing  so  are you on  i don't know  i hear myself  talk again marge  hello  hello  he's on  he's on  they're a little long  i want to adjust that mic  okay 
[01:33:30]  no not your headphone volume  silly  so what happened  you found the pickled punk  in the back office  yeah  and the thing was  that i didn't know  how i got there  you never heard us  talking about the  pickled punk  on the show  unfortunately did not  so um...  my concern was that someone dropped it off  maliciously because maybe we're making jokes of lacy peterson  and all  because someone dropped off the pickle park i'm wondering how long it took the  pickle park to fill out all the paperwork  and poet taking pictures of it 
[01:34:00]  it actually started when it was in the guy's balls  went through the whole pregnancy and the abortion  and the formaldehyde  you forgot to sign here little thing  and what kind of id did the pickle punk actually have for paul  i need a photo photo id  gentlemen  yeah  all right so  so um... after that uh... what the first thing i did of course was a pull paul over and  uh...  he was like oh i don't know if that's real and i kept saying that it is real and then i spoke  to bruce as well 
[01:34:30]  and  you found out it was real by poking it  well actually uh... you can tell it's real i've seen one of those in uh... germany when i was out in germany  really in it yeah  and it looks very real  but you still had to poke it  and ultimately to actually really find out if uh... if it was real well actually i was  what part of the body did you poke  the head  of course  the head  that's good  uh... that's good  did it go back into the left  jesus you're poking the head of a fetus that's real smart  well you know i had to find out again like i said i had no knowledge that it was here before 
[01:35:00]  so i thought it was a malicious act so  uh...  i noticed that i was very uh...  very detailed  uh... saw the genitals it's a little girl  oh yeah  that's why to take it out of the jar  uh... no i did not i have moved the jar around  you wanted to see its genitals that's why you touch it  uh... you didn't poke the head you open the legs  sicko  has a little tiny anus  uh...  uh...  nice  yet keep talking all the details of that show that this story 
[01:35:30]  so uh... so it was a pervert in jesus jewish  actually i was trying to smell and if it's that  pete  but from on the high but it's not too much of a strong smell from on the high  the shadow of a alcohol based  and that  but you do you lost sleep though the night before you decided to have molest this  thing well the the thing was that uh...  so my higher-ups but that i everybody wanted me to believe that it was fake and i  was determined to uh... prove that it was real  uh... it's real yeah 
[01:36:00]  it's real  it's absolutely really should take a bite out of it  uh...  you sink your teeth into like halfway through the head and just bite through the  ears and the bridge of the nose and you chew it  oh my god  stop it  you know the stench that would come off of that into your mouth and your molars  cook it up like hot wings  no you just eat it raw  just take a bite  she wasn't aborted  you know what it would come apart like i don't know how many people get this reference but 
[01:36:30]  remember when damon  went to visit uh... his pal there a rat in the restaurant when he was on the date  and he bit into that thing  at the table he goes hey rad how you doing  yeah i come here all the time  and he bit that thing and it kind of popped and water shot out of it  oh my god  hey hey you forgot your wallet  you forgot your abortion over my  well i want marsh i want to say dr marsh  uh... said that the uh... the tiny anus appeared to be of normal size and uh... consistency  and he's saying that it wasn't aborted um... how do you know it wasn't aborted 
[01:37:00]  well i think it's not aborted um... because you will see bruise on the fetus  if it was aborted uh-huh uh-huh and there are no bruises on the fetus  except for the finger marks you put in its head  now it probably has bruises  but isn't it gray  no it's uh... whitish  it's white  it's whitish so it doesn't really have any pigment on it  it's well preserved it's uh... yeah it's disgusting  sandwich  so then what happened when  what did you guys decide to do  so ultimately what happened was uh...  let's drop it out the fifth floor window 
[01:37:30]  oh  spolat  long of our careers  spolat  we spoke to dc and uh... they wanted to ask one of you guys  but you guys were on vacation we didn't bother  by the using on a cruise ship  and be bothered with  that fetus questions  so when i come in on monday first uh...  person that i see steve  and i say steve uh... by the way on there was a box in the back and he said oh  yeah the fetus  and i freaked out 
[01:38:00]  and i was like oh you know about it  and he said yeah it's been with us all this time and he explained the story to me about  andy gore and all that good stuff  what happened to the fetus  it is still in opie's office  oh it is  yeah why don't you give it back that's just creepy  get that thing out of here  i've been trying but  get that god damn thing out of here  give it a proper burial  they won't let me get out on a boat off of modesto and drop it in the water  he won't let me travel uh... with it or anything  so why because you got to pay for another ticket  so we'll be afraid of a break in his bag  you pull out a duffel bag the fetus is stuck to the back of one of your books 
[01:38:30]  see like one of its little feet has fallen off  it's got the ipod headphones on  that make a great commercial  all right well thanks  yeah thank you  for that  thanks danny  poking  poked his head  the whole head's a soft spot isn't it  on something that old  oh you did not come back  he's been doing that to you for six months  walking back  i want you to poke him in the head 
[01:39:00]  removing the curse of the pickled punk  yes  ah right  we have a whole discussion on this pickled punk that andy gore gave me  personally because i said i had a fascination for pickled punk  so he decided to give me one as a present  we still have this thing  oh oh i got you now  yeah  oh oh no i thought you said spite i'm okay  i thought  no i thought you said spite i'm okay  here's the bit where we talk about removing the curse of the pickled punk 
[01:39:30]  yeah  so hit it  when they're not awful  okay terrific  the worst of opium anthony  no more of that it's bad for you  let's go to yukon the trucker  yukon  hey what's going on fellas  hey yukon  hey i want to know uh opium what time did you bring that pickle punk to the studio  the punk has been here  almost since day one  pretty much the first or second week i brought it back uh...  i brought it back in from my house 
[01:40:00]  uh... okay i was just thinking that maybe it was jinx in the studio  maybe he should get past him and knocking his nine toes to pedal down the d.c. with his  splinter feet  i completely agree that the pickled punk is uh...  is disrupting my life  it's jinxing  and now i think it's disrupting the life of everyone in the uh... new york facility  yeah  uh... you know what i'm getting a lot of people asking about the pickled punk they want to take it off my hands  can you just give it away  i don't know  i don't know  that's  shouldn't we get some kind of uh... one of those people 
[01:40:30]  uh... with like a  an exorcist  something like maybe somebody with a crystal ball or something  some kind of voodoo  yeah maybe read the palm of the pickled punk see what uh... life it was supposed to have  i think  some type of decent burial  is in order for the pickled punk  i... nope  nope  no  nope  i'm not taking a chance  on what  it might need a christian burial or something  like you figure if you just bury it  yeah  it'll be haunting 
[01:41:00]  i don't know what religion it is  i don't know either  you know i really think the only solution to the pickled punk  thing is to have andy gore come back and get it  and claim it  yes  he really jinxed you by giving it to you  because now i think he maybe he had a problem with it  identified it as the jinx pickled punk and gave it to you  and now you know  how do you get rid of it  how do you dispose of a fetus  i think if you give it back to the person who gave it to you then then then 
[01:41:30]  oh is that what you're saying  it's never that easy in movies  it's never that easy  you can't just give  once you give somebody a bad luck thing it's not as simple as just going  hi i'm returning this thank you  why not  because you gotta go through some ritual or some very difficult thing or activity or go to some strange faraway place that's dangerous to get to  get to  that's the only way you can cure that  like the brady bunch we're talking about the tiki idol  they couldn't just put it back  they had to give it to mr hanalei and had to tell him to go to the cave and and vincent price was there and it's very dangerous for the kids but how about we burn something in all the corners of the room 
[01:42:00]  like sage  like sage  is that the thing they burn  i think they burn sage  but it has to be burned in every corner of the room  you can't just walk around the place with sage burning it you have to burn it into each corner of the room  you know that  i do some of that reading sometimes  what the hell you burn it in the corner of a room 
[01:42:30]  yeah it gets rid of the badness  i thought you just had to wave it around  no you don't just wave sage around  what am i learning something new here  of course not you burn it and then you make sure it hits every corner of the room  well  someone will back me up on this one  i'm not i'm not denying it i'm just saying i don't think that'll work unless you get rid of the pickled punk first in the appropriate fashion  i think as soon as we get rid of the pickled punk it all is going to be good with the show  could you imagine you get rid of it and everything miraculously just works here in the studio 
[01:43:00]  oh  all of a sudden we have no  we're not butting heads with anybody at xm anymore  it's just everything is fine with the world  you gotta get rid of that thing  i blame it on the pickled punk  it is the pickled punk  that nasty little face  rrrr  what do we do  i think  give it back  i think we just give it back  but there's gotta be some kind of ceremony  i think we give it back with some kind of ceremony with maybe some sage burning in the corners of the room  burning sage in the corners of the room  yep 
[01:43:30]  give it back  i like it  at the sage you kind of sold me with the sage  because i'm thinking you can't just give it back but a little say but there's something missing  i think we need to uh... all come into work one day with robes  with hoods  maybe like a robe with a purple hood  and then we all just walk around the sage  ah...  oh  something like that  and you guys will follow me  whoa turn the lights back on  you're freaking me out man  scaring me  holy shit 
[01:44:00]  they're turning the lights down  and i didn't even know you were turning the lights down  like what the fuck is going on in here  yeah okay  all right sage  sage  hoods  hoods  but there's no real element of danger involved  usually there's some kind of danger that has to be involved when returning these evil things  getting rid of it  well we could all like uh... i don't know  uh... eat pea soup and see what happens  see if we vomit it back up  see if someone's head starts spinning around the room  in evil fashion  no we're all gonna get uh... robes with hoods 
[01:44:30]  yeah  with some kind of weird like uh...  an emblem  some kind of weird emblem  that's just silly  that might be either good or bad we don't even know you know  like the druids  maybe with like some kind of a star like a half  no a half moon  half moon  half moon a star  and a plus sign  nope  plus sign  no pentagram though  no no no no  no evil  no because we all know what that is  yeah  it has to be some kind of emblem you really don't know what it is 
[01:45:00]  okay  but you know it's gonna work  and you guys will have to follow me around the room as i'm burning the sage  into each corner of the room  how come we're involved in this  it's your punk  yeah but uh... obviously it's affected the show  it's affected this place  and you know people's lives are  a little strange these days  now the punk has been touched though  by mars  yeah that's not good but i had nothing to do with that  but  i had nothing to do with someone actually poking the pickled punk  he might have been sleeping and stuff and now you woke him up 
[01:45:30]  hey look we're looking up emblems online  yeah i like that one  i like the cross symbol with like the noose at the top  is that called an onc  i have no idea  how the fuck do you know it was an onc  forget  aristotle  socrates  here comes  professor anthony  i just know it as a cross with like the  i like a noose thing at the top and you know  do you even know  do you know how to spell it  uh... no i i i'm awful at spelling opie 
[01:46:00]  all right  sorry  that's one thing professor anthony needs to study  this is spelling skills  thank god for spell check  god i used to get railed  uh... when i used to have to write things  i use spell check now  i defy you to find misspelling in the past  even couple of years i would say  well i can break out the xm satellite radio contract  i i think you barely spelled your name right  i was probably drunk at the time  all right so i understand years ago i was you know very bad 
[01:46:30]  and but when i had to write things off just awful  now spell check is so easy  just pop it right in there it calls you an idiot  gives you the right spelling you move on  look like a genius  all right we got to figure out something with this pickle punk  it's uh... it's obvious  yeah i i am a little  i'm a little frightened  it has really kind of put a damper on the show  thank you  why did you even ask for it  it's the worst thing you could possibly have  is a fetus 
[01:47:00]  staring at you through a glass jar  it's cool if you go over uh...  what's his name andrew's house  and you know go on his tour of all of his pickled punks  but to have one  you don't want to have one  nine  you walk through a freak show  you look at the bearded lady  you're not thinking of taking her home  you  just kind of look at it  admire it as a freak  and move on  and all kidding aside a lot of bad things happen after i got the pickle punk  yeah so i'm partly serious here by the way  i don't want to give you the laundry list but it was a really bad two and a half years 
[01:47:30]  but there's no  guidelines as to what you do with it to get rid of any evilness that might be a spread around  in the movies it's easy  they go  oh and i'm reading in this book that you have to do a b c d  all right well why don't we go down to one of those ancient bookstores somewhere in the village  and maybe talk to the person behind the counter  and they'll go  oh yeah  who's been alive for like four hundred years  but he still fits into society  right  that's mysterious  yeah 
[01:48:00]  and then maybe he can direct us to a book  that book  yeah a book that he has to go  the necromonicon  oh i got just what you need  and he goes in the back  and also comes out with his book with a leather like  leather case or something  necromonicon  yeah and this goes  blows it off  and there's the title of the book  and it's perfect for our situation  and then get thumbed through to  pickled punk removal  pickled punk removal section  there's never a  it's never like that  you never  it's never that simple  i can't wait to start smoking pot again 
[01:48:30]  because this sounds great  it's like the old asian guy in gremlins  yeah  downstairs  yeah  you gotta kinda you know  find an out of the way spot  we have to go to a bookstore somewhere  it's an out of place bookstore  but the guy has to have some kind of like  like long beard  long weird beard  long weird beard  and it can't just be an old bookstore  it's gotta be like an occult place though  doesn't it?  no  that's the beauty of it  it could just be an old bookstore  the gremlins guy  he was just kind of in this cool little shop 
[01:49:00]  little shop  and then it had that  you know  yeah exactly  alright so it's an old bookstore  yeah  but it can't be like a borders or something  nah nah  it's gotta be like an independent bookstore  independent  you can't like go in there and get some coffee  nah nah  an independent bookstore  that might have some children's books off to the side a little bit  really?  yeah just a little bit  just to create the illusion  that you might be using this bookstore for other things  but then what's like the secret word to let the guy know 
[01:49:30]  look we need a little more than what you're showing out here  hmm  a scar on my body  what?  I don't even  what?  some kind of scar on my body  and you show it and he goes  oh  I got what you need  exactly  and he goes around back  and he's been waiting a very long time for me to show up  like his whole life  isn't gonna work?  his whole life has been just waiting for this moment where I show up to show the scar  what scar do you have? 
[01:50:00]  I don't know  I got like this  I got a really bad scar from when I was a kid where I tried to open an orange juice can  that isn't his  you mean that back then you were opening an orange juice can and that was sealing your fate back then?  who knows now I'm starting to think  it has to be something odd  and a little strange  and I tried to push the lid down and the edge of the orange juice can almost took my whole thumb off  look it's still there twenty some odd years later  that  dude that means nothing  it would have to be some kind of strange occurrence  if the orange juice lid mysteriously flung off the counter and zipped like a saw blade into your finger 
[01:50:30]  that's one thing  you're opening up a can as a kid and that's putting this high sign scar on your thumb to show the guy in the shop?  I believe it set me down the road and it brought us to this moment  you're gonna put your thumb up and he's gonna be like yeah?  what can I help you with sir?  you know what I never really noticed what this scar spells out or something 
[01:51:00]  maybe we should get a little ink and I'll press it down on a piece of paper to see what it's all about  by the way that's gonna be my new autograph when we go out  oh is that it?  yeah  just gonna dip it in ink and give a thumbprint of your orange juice lid scar  because now the scar, because we've talked about it on the radio, is very famous  we have learned that if you talk about something it gets famous  how many people are gonna ask me to see the scar now?  let me see the orange juice lid scar  out and about  here it is, the orange juice can't scar  alright so you're with me or what?  no not with the scar  I was up to 
[01:51:30]  I'm feeling it because I want to get rid of this too  but the scar thing  alright what are you feeling?  are you feeling like some weird emblem thing on our purple rose?  oh that's good  no because we gotta walk into the place and have some kind of weird emblem  maybe something around your neck  like a necklace thing or a ring or something that  I got this cool thing on my, this cool cross thing that I wear all the time  it's a cross  which by the way I've been walking around Manhattan and really bothering people  I just will hold it up and go for the Pope, for the Pope 
[01:52:00]  really?  yeah  and they look at you like you have three heads  yeah  this pot thing's gonna work out just nicely  you think it's gonna be good?  yeah, I gotta start smoking that pot again  I'm thinking a ring, some kind of ring that you gotta give the guy something and he sees the ring and goes oh okay  like a decoder ring?  yeah  something like that  maybe I have something in my apartment that is the missing piece of some kind of  some kind of ancient puzzle  well somebody has it in their possession of course  because fate would have delivered it to you years ago for just this moment 
[01:52:30]  unlike your stupid orange juice hand scar  it would actually mean something  so I should look for some kind of  have you come across any piece of jewelry or something with an emblem on it that you probably would like  why am I keeping this? I should throw it away  but you just keep it and it's a little weird  well I got a shark tooth necklace when I was in the Bahamas over vacation  yeah that's uh... no  seemed like just a thing to buy but maybe that was it  you know what probably would have been it?  that finger bone necklace that you got years ago 
[01:53:00]  dude that's buried  you buried it where?  in my parents backyard  see? you gotta dig that up  no way am I digging that up  wear that to the bookshop  of course it makes total sense now  it was always the finger bone  I had a human finger bone necklace  right  that Chuck Farnham gave me  Chuck Farnham was selling these things  he actually went to um...  I know exactly where that is  a supplier  I did bury that  of bones  of human bones  he called it cannibal wear 
[01:53:30]  and Opie in his sick fascination once again  decided he was gonna get one of these things  he wore it for a while  but noticed it stunk  he would sit doing the radio show  sniffing this thing all day  to my disgust  he'd hold this finger bone up to his nose  and just...  he'd be sniffing it all day long  maybe it's the missing bone  that brings some kind of skeleton  to life  ooh  now you're getting a little far-fetched  why not?  you think that would be it?  but I think it's the bone  that you have to wear around your neck 
[01:54:00]  to show the guy at the bookstore  that's gonna then let him know  what we need  to get rid of the  bad karma  and the fetus  the pickled punk  I think you gotta dig up the  the finger bone  you know where it is?  yeah I do  it's still got the leather around it?  it's kinda buried in like  the pet cemetery section of our backyard  really?  oh great  you can dig up a cat bone  by mistake  the guy's gonna go  that's a cat bone  I can't help you  I think it's  yeah I think it's  buried close to one of my cats 
[01:54:30]  that we buried  or one of the goldfish we lost  did you bury it with the rawhide  that tied around your neck?  oh yeah  did you put it in a box  or did you just bury it in the dirt?  no man  let nature take its course  the dirt?  alright well it could still  I don't think it decompose that fast  how long ago did you bury it?  dude that's years ago right?  yeah  I'm trying to remember  probably 3, 4 maybe?  oh at least  could be 5 years ago?  I think it's 5 years  dude you gotta dig it up now  and put it around your neck  and we gotta go to the bookstore  imagine I walk in with like 
[01:55:00]  my hair all askew like Ben  and  and I got this necklace around my neck  that says rotting  and dirty  and  but that'll tip him off  little maggots  crawling all over it  and it makes sense  because it's not easy  alright it's not all that difficult  but it's not something sitting around like the scar on your thumb  you gotta go back  you gotta find where you buried it  you gotta dig up this thing that's been gone for years now  it's a human bone  buried  dig it up 
[01:55:30]  put it back around your neck  now we gotta go to the bookstore  now it's all coming together  this makes sense now  so the guy is gonna recognize the bone necklace?  he'll see the bone necklace  then he'll know what our problem is  because this whole thing is tied together  so then he'll get that book that no one has really looked for  right  and then in there will be the instructions  how to get rid of this pickled punk  and the bad luck that it has brought  this is beautiful  this is gonna work 
[01:56:00]  alright  dig it up  when are you going out?  what if I can't find it?  you have to  you always find it in the movies  I will try to find the bone necklace  I gotta find it  Opie Potter  it's our only hope  can we see the pickled punk today?  no!  I don't want to look upon it  I don't want to look upon it anymore  I just want to make sure Mars didn't wreck it by poking it too hard  dude don't look at it  leave it sealed up in the box 
[01:56:30]  is it still in the box?  do not gaze upon it  I don't think it's cool that we disrespected the pickled punk  what's this wee shit?  I didn't touch it  I want whatever's in charge of the pickled punk to know  no!  get it out of here  dude you're suffocating it  don't bring it in here  let it breathe  no!  let the pickled punk breathe  no!  let it see the light  why are you doing this?  get it out of here  why is it sealed up like that?  you're sending it to the FBI?  it's got a rubber band around the box  it says punk this side up with an arrow 
[01:57:00]  what disrespect  the punk has to see  has to see  no!  no!  if he sees then he does  put the punk back  it's in a box  for some reason though  it's got this mystic rubber band around it  that holds it  it's able to hold it  hold it all the goodness  it's some chain with an ancient lock  lock of you know  something that holds it in  and if you take that off  then the evil gets out  this is a rubber band 
[01:57:30]  from the supply closet  shouldn't it be some kind of ancient lock  where only one person has the key  dude that should be in some crafted wooden box  with carved emblems on it  with some weird lock  that's ancient golden lock  with a key that is only held by the high priest  of blah blah blah blah blah  who could just be one of our interns  and we didn't know he was a high priest  it's in a god damn ipod box 
[01:58:00]  with a rubber band around it  no wonder it's pissed  we stink as being sorcerers  years ago this thing  for years this thing has been on this earth  this punk we've been told  could be  it's at least 90 years old  could be over a hundred years old  and it's been here on this earth  think of where it's been  what it's seen  what it's been contained in  and it ends up in 2005 
[01:58:30]  in a cardboard box with a rubber band around it  of course it's pissed  we're not giving it the respect it deserves  that's why I think we have to get it out of the box immediately  no no  immediately  look  keep it in the box  let it get some sunlight today  it's pissed off but you gotta leave it where it is  you don't just pull it out all pissed  we gotta figure  you gotta dig up that bone  we gotta go to the bookstore  where's the bookstore?  I don't know  that's part of the mystery  we're gonna be going into ten bookstores 
[01:59:00]  and go hello to the counter guy  and he's gonna ask  can I help you?  and then you'll just tap the bone with your finger  are the hardy boys still working?  perhaps you haven't seen this around my neck, sir  that's lovely, what can I help you with?  I will be so disappointed if somebody doesn't look upon that bone around your neck and go  oh, I know what you need  and I just know it's not gonna work  because shit like this never works 
[01:59:30]  maybe we should just, you know, just, I don't know, to finish this up  maybe we should just come up with our own ceremony and hope for the best  it's gotta be based on something though  you know, it's gotta be based on some ritual that's tried and true  it's gotta be some kind of burial ritual  I think, I think  I don't wanna keep, you know, pounding this into the ground  but I think we have to give it back to Andy Gore with some kind of ceremony  right, okay  you have to give it back to that 
[02:00:00]  I can't take the responsibility of thinking it needs a burial  right, no, I agree with you on that  but this needs to be some type of ceremony  whether it was a burial ceremony or some other kind of  a passing of the, a passing of the  somewhere along the line, the link was broken  right, so the link was broken when Andy Gore gave it to me  right, so I have to give it back to Andy Gore  the punk belongs to certain people  it's their fate to possess the punk throughout history 
[02:00:30]  Andy, of course, is one of those people  that is meant to possess the punk  you, on the other hand, were not  obviously  you weren't meant to  so we bring it back to Andy  so Andy gets it back  and then he'll find the next person that was really supposed to have this thing  right, or actually that, it just happens  like, how did Andy get it?  I don't know  do you remember?  you didn't even get a history of this punk before you got it?  you're taking possession of something that's probably a century old  and you didn't get a history like, alright, where did it come from?  it's not even a good pickled punk 
[02:01:00]  shhh  it's a fine  it's a fine punk  it's a fine punk  shhh  Landru will hear you  there are witches  there are witches  I love that Star Trek  that's like two episodes  Landru will hear you  it's a wonderful punk  someone suggesting we bury the punk next to Chester 
[02:01:30]  no, Chester isn't buried  Chester is  cremated in an urn, by the way  and for you people that are keeping track  my ex-mother-in-law has kept Chester's ashes  and when she passes  she has told people she wants the ashes buried with her  there you go  someone wants Patrick Monaki to drive it down to Louisiana  someone wants to know if Andy Gore has been having good luck ever since he gave me the punk  someone is saying give the punk a proper burial 
[02:02:00]  and of course, Pat from California  send the punk to Scott Peterson  oh, Jesus, he knows how to get rid of him  Melanie from Cleveland says  don't go digging up any bones  I'll write a spell for you  it will take care of everything  and yes, you can find spells and witchcraft books at Borders  or go to a metaphysical shop  a few candles, a spice, and a chant  and it will be okay  what kind of spice?  is it sage?  yeah, what am I going to use?  a little cinnamon? 
[02:02:30]  if you guys want a cinnamon  oregano, take the fetus  now add a little oregano  this is going to be wonderful  we're going to get rid of all the evilness  that has entered your life  take this little, now a little cumin and some cinnamon on here  wonderful, now whisk the little guy up with some  what spice do you use?  yeah, you can't just...  now put the blender on for a pay  I got a really good spice that makes your pizza taste really good 
[02:03:00]  oh, maybe that'll work  I think it's called like a pizza spice  take the bite out of the head that Jimmy described yesterday  and it'll be tasty  it has a little red pepper in it  a little oregano and some other things  I don't think we'll be putting any spice  well, if you guys want to send in your chants  maybe we can pick the best one  a chant?  is that what she said?  yeah, do a chant  someone says, um  Rev, from Whackbag  I'll be seeing Andy at the end of the month  at the Chiller Theater convention

[02:32:30]  Speaking of, uh, fat people  Oh!  Nice segway  I was trying  I don't think it really worked  But fat people are not diseased  Yeah, that was the subject of this bit  Fat activists are upset with fat actress  With Rich Voss in studio  The guy's comment on fatties and eating disorders  Get compared to drug addiction and alcoholism  I just wonder if Voss tries to sound smart  There's always a problem  Yeah  His little stiff claymation hands go straight 
[02:33:00]  Let me tell you something  What?  What?  It's always like  It's always some childlike observation  Childlike  It really is  It's all his mind can really wrap around  You know, really, if you drink too much  Wow, aww, that's cute  You wanna just hold his hand  Little hand  Little rotten gargoyle fingers  Those fingers look good over a library entrance  Awful hands  Non-bending  The worst of Opie and Anthony 
[02:33:30]  This is some sexual reference  Kirstie Alley, fat actress  What do you guys think?  Yes, she is  She is  She is  The show is just awful  Of course it is  It's absolutely awful  It's getting horrible reviews  The acting stinks  They're kinda doing like  A Curb Your Enthusiasm thing  Which is so stupid  To try to even copy that format  Yeah  But you're gonna see a bunch of these shows come out now  Just like Curb Your Enthusiasm  Of course  One good concept, 50 rip offs  So here it is 
[02:34:00]  Kirstie Alley is poking fun at her own weight problems  In the new series Fat Actress  We all know that  But members of the National Eating Disorders Association  Are biting mad at the show  She's fat  Making fat jokes  End of story  But there's a group out there  Pissed off that Kirstie Alley  Who's fat  Is making fun of her fatness  Yeah  Because she has a sense of humor  Why can't these people organize  If they're gonna have an organization  Why don't you organize  And go to a gym  Yeah  Why don't you all get together  Oh it's never that  Let's meet at five  And get on a treadmill  For a few minutes 
[02:34:30]  Wait to hear these clips  Wait to hear these clips  The head of the Seattle based organization  Isn't seeing the humor in Alley's show  And believes it might even be harmful  To people with eating disorders  Uh  The character appears to be suffering  From a binge eating disorder  Said Lynn  CEO of the association  That's not funny  She's eating a cigarette  So she could clear her stomach  It's appalling  I'm meeting people  Who lost their children  To eating disorders  There's nothing funny  About eating disorders  There's just no punchline  What does CEO mean?  The current elephant on duty?  Fat cunt 
[02:35:00]  Shut your mouth  I don't drop the c-bomb very often  In the series which premiered Monday  Well I think this is an older article  Alley is seen gorging herself  Overdosing on laxatives  And sticking a feather down her throat  So that she could purge  Without running her  Without ruining her manicure  Sorry  There you go 
[02:35:30]  The association has gotten  Jimmy where are you going?  To throw up  Oh  Where's he going?  This is perfect for him  The association has gotten calls and emails  Complaining about the show  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  I just said why don't we get one of these  We have an article like this  We should get like  Let's try to get one of these people on the phone  Oh that would be nice  It would be nice  But why not?  You know if we're going to do an article  Get the spokespeople  I'm going to want to come on  And give their point if you want a radio show  They probably would  Right  Especially if set up like  We were sympathetic to their cause 
[02:36:00]  The Greg and Anthony show  Yes  The Tony and Greg show  The CEO Lynn was very pissed off  With the feather seed  I guess  Kirstie Alley  Well they stick it down her throat  You should not make light of bulimia  And that sort of thing  The purging and binging opiates  It's a harmful disease  You know but why can you make fun of alcoholism  And drug addiction  And skinny people  But fat people are out of the collection  That's right  I used to live with an anorexic  She took 80  No 60 laxatives a day  I'm not lying 
[02:36:30]  She shit to bed one night  When I was sleeping  Hot  Dude I went out with a girl  For  Ugh  Are you binging and purging over there Ovi  What are you doing  When I was in college  I went out with her for like a second man  This girl was  Knocked down gorgeous  We called her  Well I can't say her name  I shouldn't say her name  That's fair  But we would go to Red Lobster for a really nice meal  And she was real thin  And she would just  Red Lobster for a nice meal  Dude I was eating 
[02:37:00]  Christ  Did you put your gold teeth in  No  I was 20 years old  We had a homeboys go for a nice meal  Yeah I know  What's the matter  You couldn't get a reservation at the Sizzler  You guys are delusional  All the sangria  You guys have changed man  What  You don't think there's listeners out there thinking that Red Lobster would be a good meal for them  Yeah they work 10 hours a day, 6 days a week  Right  Well that's what I'm saying  I was 20 years old  I used to go to the one on Jericho Turnpike  All the time  Dude I sold my 
[02:37:30]  All the time  I sold my books in college to get  You know spending money to drink  To go to Red Lobster  To go to Red Lobster  And then to go to a Red Lobster  Thinking I was going to get laid at the end of it  Are you kidding me?  Are you kidding me?  Things are different now  Back in the day Red Lobster was a  You know that's a good date  You're right  Nice dessert at Baskin Robbins after it  Yeah  Now it's the Olive Garden  It's a hot place to take a meal  You guys are just not in touch with the common man anymore  Dude we certainly are  I completely  I used to go to the Red Lobster all the time  Anthony's bitching and complaining because he has 24 hours to pack for his 10 day cruise  He has 
[02:38:00]  He has  He got the best room available  And he's pissed off that he didn't get the one with the grand piano  He's got like a 2 level suite  And that's his big complaint today  That he's got 24 hours to pack for this unbelievable vacation  That he's been looking forward to for 2 years  And I'm trying to share a cute story when I was very poor  The Red Lobster  And I appreciated the Red Lobster meal when it happened  And today I still appreciate it  Oh 
[02:38:30]  There you go  Today you would never go  No  Yo give me some more of them shrimp  That's what you get there  Some catfish  To make a long story short  No great ending to the story but you know she would just stuff herself at the  Well this one particular time  It happened a few times but this was the one when I knew  Yeah  And she went to the bathroom  She was gone for 15 minutes after we gorged ourselves  And came back and you just could tell that she was just puking it all up in the room  Really?  I would punch her in her fucking face 
[02:39:00]  You could tell  I could tell in her eye  Her eye  I mean you just could tell  I'm like what am I getting myself into  You just watch them push the food around the plate Dan  They don't eat it  They just  You could tell when you kissed her and tasted scallops and bile  Well the back of their teeth are always rotting out  Yeah  Stomach acid that's coming up  Their esophaguses are all messed up  But they're nice bodies  And they're always hot  They should look good  Those titties look really great until they go a little too far  So I encourage you to continue puking for a little while 
[02:39:30]  Sure  Did I ever tell you that I lost a chick to John Stamos too?  Did you?  Really?  That's not bad  Yeah I lost a chick to John Stamos  I was going out with this  She was gorgeous man  Do you think he took her to Red Lobster?  Well what happened was I was doing radio in Rochester going out with  I mean she was in a couple magazines let's just put it that way  Oh  She won some competitions  Yeah  And uh  But she was a coke whore  Well I don't know the whore part 
[02:40:00]  Right  Well I got something  But I didn't have to do the coke thing  What's the but?  Uh  Where's the problem?  So  I'm  I think I found my  I found my dream woman  Except for the little problem she had  Yeah  But she was like a 10 so I was like ah  You don't notice things  You look past stuff like coke addiction  So then uh  So then she comes down to New York for I don't know  I'm trying to remember like a vacation or something  Yeah  Ends up hooking up with John Stamos before he was famous  Before he was famous  Oh  Lost a chick to John Stamos 
[02:40:30]  Before famous John Stamos  When he was like  When he was blacky  On the general hospital  Yeah  Yeah  Still a handsome guy though  Used to watch that show years ago  Sure  Anyway getting back to this  Gave me red lobster money  Getting back to this  Some of that red lobster money  And yes her pictures are out there somewhere  Yeah  Good luck finding it  Anyway  So Lynn the CEO of this organization Anthony  She's pissed off about the feather scene  Where Kirstie Alley you know  Shoves it down her throat to puke 
[02:41:00]  They're offering advice about purging without ruining your manicure  Said Lynn  When I saw that I thought  Oh no I promise you somebody will try that  Because people with eating disorders are not thinking clearly  Apparently not  Wow  They can't stop shoving food in their fucking fat faces  They're not thinking clearly  So then  We got some audio of these organizations bitching about the show  Listen to this one  The show is insulting to fat people everywhere 
[02:41:30]  I would hope that people would be outraged by this  This is promoting hatred  It's promoting self-hatred and hatred of people that are fat all over the place  Yes  Yeah  And  Yeah point is  What promotes hatred of fat people is a cross-country flight next to one of you  That is what promotes hatred of fat people  Yeah  You slovenly gorillas  You know people have to understand  If you're fat 
[02:42:00]  You're going to be made fun of  Yes  It's just the way it is  That's life  You're going to be made fun of  Because you're fat  Unless you're fat  And don't try to pawn it off like she does  As a disease  Unless your thyroid is melting down  It's not a disease  There are some people honestly  But it's such a small percentage of people  That are overweight because of some real medical problem 
[02:42:30]  The disease angle is the same as alcoholism or drug addiction  Right  In that it is this mania, this obsession  However, being an alcoholic and an addict  I understand the disease  And there has to come a point where you go  You know what?  I'm going to do something for myself  You are still consciously making the decision to do nothing for yourself  Right  So while there is a sickness element to it  That is an obsession that is beyond rational thinking  You're still making the decision to not help yourself  Or to try  I think  I don't buy the word disease 
[02:43:00]  You know something?  It is something  Right  I'll say it's something  So give it another word  But to call it a disease is an insult to somebody that has diseases that they can't just cure by themselves  Yeah, if you're like getting radiation shot into your face to get rid of a disease  That's a disease  If you could just put a Twinkie down and you're cured  That ain't a fucking disease  If you could put the booze bottle down and you're cured  You're cured  Wow, you're talking to two addicts there  I saw them look at each other like 
[02:43:30]  Well, no, call it something else  I saw them look at each other like  I saw them look at each other like  Wow, you're going to speak up or am I going to speak up?  Call it an affliction?  Call it something else than a disease?  My only disagreement is that you're cured once you put the bottle down because you're the same person underneath  But all that said, there still has to be a decision you make as an individual to not engage in that behavior  No one ever poured booze down my throat  No one ever put drugs in vows  Right  You make that decision  And you know when you're doing it that it's not a good thing that you're doing 
[02:44:00]  And you should stop  But there's diseases you can cure  But you can't cure alcoholism or addiction  You're always going to be an alcoholic or an addict  And you're always going to...  You can arrest the disease  You're using the word cure though  I don't think that word should be used either  It's not like that  It's something different than a disease  Alcoholism, drug addiction  I don't see it as a disease  Well see fat people too, they compare it to alcoholism or addiction  Addiction like I've given hand jobs for the addiction  Fat people do it for the desperation 
[02:44:30]  They don't do it because they're addicted  You know what I mean?  There's a difference  I just don't see it as a disease  Something like you say there's no cure for it  Because you're always going to have that in your head  But that's why I don't see it as a disease  I see it as some type of...  I don't know  Maybe you could call it a mental disorder  Okay  Something like that  There is a physical aspect to it  Like the American Medical Association I believe is...  I don't know if they've officially called it a disease 
[02:45:00]  Alcoholism they have  Okay, simply because there is a physical thing  Where if you stop drinking  And I know guys this happened  I was in rehab with one of them  And you stop drinking for 15 or 20 years  Your progression acts as if you never stopped  You don't pick up where you left off  You pick up as if your body had never stopped  So there is some type of a physical thing there  Which may all go back to dopamine in the brain  I really don't know what it is  And the semantics of...  Is it disease?  It doesn't matter  It is something  I don't know...  You know what it is though?  You can make a conscious decision in your head  To not get a tumor  Right 
[02:45:30]  You know what I mean?  You can make a conscious decision in your head  To not pick up a drink  Or not pick up a food  Some people can't make a conscious decision  No, no...  Everyone can  I don't want to hear the bullshit  I'm an addict and it's so hard  I can't...  I gotta...  You're making a conscious decision  Maybe there's a few people...  No, no...  Once you're on health  It's a physical decision at some point  I never go  I never want to...  You know...  Cover everybody  I'm sure there are people  That are addict addicts in their life  But I gotta say  Most know  That when they are putting something in their body 
[02:46:00]  Like drugs or alcohol  That they are doing something bad  They shouldn't do it  It's making their life and their body worse  And if they just didn't do it  They wouldn't be doing it  It's that simple  It is and it isn't  I agree with you about the decision  You are making a decision whenever you pick up  I mean the bottom line is this  Addicted or not  You still know  That there's self-help groups out there  There's rehabs  There's hospitals  And detoxes  No one in modern society doesn't know that  You are making that conscious decision  Like Lady Di  She's an alcoholic 
[02:46:30]  But you know what?  She's making the decision to not help herself  Right  But there is something that happens  Once you pick it up  That is just...  It is beyond...  They say obsession  It's like an obsession  Like rational thought  Has no power over it  It's like...  Me...  I'm not a victim  When I'm home on a computer  Believe me  You think I don't know  That I shouldn't be jacking you off for 8 hours  Rationally  I'm a smart guy  I know that  I'm into this zone  I'm like...  I'm high  That is such a thing  No, no, no  But you know what I'm saying? 
[02:47:00]  I'm just saying that same mental obsession  Right, right  Which is no one's fault  I don't blame anyone  I don't blame other people for my sickness  But it is there  You're like a monkey  You're like a monkey  But fat people are...  I really am like a chimp  Fat people are rewarded in this country for losing weight  They're rewarded  Oh look he lost...  You know what I mean?  What about when you were gaining the weight  And just throwing all that garbage down your mouth?  Yeah  TV shows are giving them prizes to lose weight  Some of these fat people  They actually...  They start making themselves believe they don't want to lose weight 
[02:47:30]  And they don't want to be...  They stand there and say  No, I'm proud of who I am  And I walk around if you don't like it  But you know deep down  They look at people who aren't fat  And want to live life not as an eyesore walking around  They want to be...  Everyone has the want to be normal  You know, where you're not looked at like some kind of freak  Well don't you think you're also born with a body type too?  Like I can't...  To a point 
[02:48:00]  I can't get as big as Ralphie Mae if I ate between now and the time I died  Really?  Are you thinking you could get as fat as Ralphie Mae?  I think there is something to do with his body type  But I think if you had some massive calorie diet and didn't do exercise  Anyone I think could get that fat  If you just lay on a couch  Up to the size of Ralphie Mae  I think you're born with a body type  And then it's up to you to figure out what you're going to do within that body type  Again, you're crossed to bear then  If it means you can't have cake 
[02:48:30]  And you have to eat maybe vegetables  And then that's what you have to do  Everyone has the shit you're fed in life  You know, the shit you've got to just suck down and eat  Because that's your lot  That's the hand you were dealt  If I could find another cliche  You're right though  But that's what you've got to deal with  You can make the choice to take that hardship and deal with it  Or you can shove the cake and cookies and crap down your mouth into your fat slob  And the fact is we all had problems growing up  I'm so sick of hearing that 
[02:49:00]  Everyone has their shit  Everyone had a tough time growing up  Right  It's child abuse  Because kids grow  Kids are force fed that food when they're little kids  That's child abuse when you're feeding a kid that much and that bad  A lot of times you see a fat kid  You see a fat parent that's feeding them the same crap  The best was the Snapple lady  Talking about the reason she is overweight and fat in her adult life  Is because her parents, when she was three, decided to have another kid  Oh yeah  Yeah, that got her so troubled 
[02:49:30]  So troubled  That she had to get fat  That's her excuse why she's a fat pig now  Self-hatred, whatever causes it, is what most of this stuff is based on  You're running away from something  I have empathy for food addicts  Because as an alcoholic, as a drug addict, I can't touch it  I'm fucking ruined if I touch it  But food, it's like if you're that addicted to food  It's really hard because you have to eat to survive  You have to eat a little bit of it, right?  Yeah, that's it  Food is a really tough one, man  As much as fat groups make me nauseous  I mean there is something to be said for the fact that  If I had to do a line of coke every day 
[02:50:00]  And then that's all I could do  I would be a fucking maniac  So I mean there is something  Herking and jerking around the studio  Absolutely  Sweating, hair all a mess  Gossiping pointlessly about something  Opening windows in five degree weather  Will I drop a log the size of a patient family?  Well, but most  Most anorexic or eating disorders come from dysfunctional alcoholic families  Where they're trying to take control as kids  You know, because they're not getting that attention  I feel like a doctor  And they do it with food  You certainly don't sound like one 
[02:50:30]  Well, they do it with food  You know  Let's play another clip from this fat group, okay?  We need to talk about the imagery of women in Hollywood  Why it is so easy and okay for us to laugh at a large sized person  Why aren't we seeing more diversity?  And to know that bulimia and anorexia and compulsive eating are serious diseases  We're not seeing diversity in Hollywood because no one wants to watch that crap  By the way  Right  Um...  Carlin has the best bit on anorexia  Yeah 
[02:51:00]  Yeah  He did it at Live Aid  You know what's it called? Comic Relief?  Yeah  Because there are all these just, you know  Oh, yeah  Carlin comes out and he goes  What do you say? Anorexia  What a disease  Rich cunts don't want to eat?  Fuck them  I know  It could be the most brutal moment in comedy I've ever seen  He's just, his bit on bulimia  He has a whole bit on it  Is genius  I'm sure a lot of you have heard it  Do you think there's, you know, and this point's been brought up plenty of times  I'm not breaking any new ground here  But in impoverished nations  You don't find anorexics 
[02:51:30]  Or people with bulimia  You don't find it  Where's that disease?  Is there a cure over there that we don't know about?  Well, Anthony, they have a low-fat diet  Oh, is that it?  No  Don't forget, you don't find a lot of coke addiction either in tribes  Because most of them  But the sickness  See, it's not about the substance  Like alcohol, food addiction, drug addiction  It's all the same thing  That's all the symptoms  The problem  Whatever makes you that  You don't understand that addict  Yeah  That, I'm sure they have in those nations  So in some tribe in Africa 
[02:52:00]  It's an addiction to cutting off women's clits  Yeah, absolutely  And using them as jaspers  Jesus  Here, one more clip  And agony  Laughing because, you know  Oh, haha, it's so fast, that's not so funny  Diminishes people  We're not in our cards eating all the time  And we're not talking about how fat we are all the time  We're strong, empowered, loving, alive human beings  Empowered  You're not empowered  You're not strong  You're weak  You're loving and alive  But you're not strong and empowered 
[02:52:30]  You're absolutely right  Stop it  You have to admit  That's the way you start to fight addiction  You have to admit that you're finished  And it kicked the shit out of you  Yeah, there you go  It won  I can't  Bow to it  I can't do it  I can't do it  One and I'm finished  It smashes my fat face every time  Kicks your ass  Every time  Let's go to Carrie in Vegas  Wonderful booze  Hey  Wonderful strong booze  Morning, morning fellas  Hi Angel  Hey Carrie 
[02:53:00]  Hey, hey, hey there, squishy tits  How are you?  I'm good, thank you  I'm eating some yogurt  Hey, uh  You know  Being fat  Being fat is a disease  Yeah  Yeah  How much do you weigh, Carrie?  How much do you weigh?  No, no  Can I?  It's a muscular disease  Because I have it  My arm muscles keep putting fucking Big Macs in my mouth  There you go  Very funny  You need to stop putting the fucking Big Macs in your mouth  You'll lose weight  It's a simple thing  And you know  I hate to beat a dead horse 
[02:53:30]  But I can barely hear you guys  Uh huh  Are you guys doing a gag toss or is this real?  No, I called in  Remember I called in from the cell phone the other day  Just to hear it myself  All right  George, what's up?  I hate to eat a dead horse  Hey guys, sorry  Good morning  Go ahead, George  Norton and Voss  You guys should be jumping up and down  I mean  You guys know better than this  Anthony  You are so damn wrong  It's frightening  All right  It must be nice to live a life where you don't understand addiction  But for the rest of us that are addicts 
[02:54:00]  Whether it's food or drugs  It's something we have to live with every day  I just don't  I just don't  I'm not saying  It's not  It's nothing  I'm not saying  It's anything less than you're saying it is  It absolutely is  I'd be stupid to say it's not  What I'm saying is  It is not a disease  It's like schizophrenia  You don't get  You know  Just because it's not a tumor  Doesn't make it a disease  But dude, what do you mean we should be jumping up and down?  We are explaining  I'm explaining my point of view  My mania for alcohol  I'm not a doctor  I don't know the medical things that go into it 
[02:54:30]  I just know what happens to me  I don't understand  I got 13 years of sobriety  Timmy  You probably got a bunch  I got 18 years  You know the drill  Absolutely  But I also understand  What I'm trying to explain  It's hard to explain  That the underlying sickness  That the problem  Whether it's booze or drugs  Or food or gambling  It is all the same  They're all like subheadings  Under the same illness  They're a symptom of you  It's absolutely impossible to explain to somebody who does not have a disease  No, you've explained it fine  I can understand it  Believe me, sir 
[02:55:00]  I understand  And I agree  I think it's an insult to people with diseases to call it a disease  It isn't, but why can't you call it a disease?  It's a semantics argument  It is a semantics argument  Anthony doesn't feel it's a disease  I know medically it has been classified  But to me  It doesn't matter either way  That's irrelevant as to what they call it  You understand what I mean?  I don't care  Some people want to accept that it is  Accept that it's okay to me either way  I don't care  I just know I have it  And I know what it does to me  It doesn't matter  The reason it's called it for some reason too 
[02:55:30]  Is also for insurance reasons  And for rehabs and stuff  I'm not saying you're wrong about that  I think eating is probably harder to change your behavior than drugs or alcohol  I agree  If you walk through a day without drugs or alcohol  You have to eat  That's what I'm saying before  And being able to change that  Jimmy you know  Don't take a drink  Don't take a drug  I know that  But I can't not eat during the day  Well I was just saying that a couple of minutes ago  I mean I do have empathy for people  But as you know as an addict as well  There is a decision we have to make to go look  Like when I quit smoking 
[02:56:00]  When I quit smoking  I quit off  I think what happened in the opening  I had the moment of clarity  And I stopped  And I was going to finish the pack  And Anthony actually said to me  Just put the fucking things down  And dude it was such disgust in his voice  Well I said I'm going to have one more cigarette  Which normally doesn't work with an addiction  But I had one more cigarette  I went down to the cell  I made the decision  Esty helped me  She took me got the patch  I did the patch program  The way it was suggested that I do it  And I had the willingness to quit  So you know what I mean  We have to make that decision  But also too you say you have to eat 
[02:56:30]  But also you can eat right  There's a difference between eating healthy  And eating you know  Bundt cakes all day long  Yeah see that's about  That's the argument you should be able to drink right  No no no no no no no  No that's not the same argument  Because I know  I'm with Vos  Because I see these people in the supermarkets  Like okay you're fat  You need to eat  You have some kind of fucking chemical imbalance  Whatever you want to call it  An addiction  But why are you you know  Filling up your cart with enemans  I've seen  But at the end of the day guys 
[02:57:00]  It's an addiction  You're right  You're right  Hold on hold on  What did you say dude  Did you say what?  You end up  You and I  You know we all know that  I mean I suffer from the same kind of addiction  Jimmy that you do  Sitting in front of a computer  Oh yeah yeah absolutely  You replace one with another  Substitution  The problem is  You can't really  You know trying to change  Addictive behavior  Takes a lifetime  No but wait a second  Didn't you say  But you still have to eat on a daily basis  If you're a food addict  Right?  Obviously you have to eat  I don't have to drink everyday  But if I have to eat 
[02:57:30]  I'm going to make a choice  Do I want to lose weight  And eat right  Or am I going to take  You know ten Oreo cookies  And put peanut butter on them  And then something else  If you're going to have to eat  You might as well eat right  And that's how you're going to lose weight  Yeah there's will power man  You know I  To a point  I mean when you're making conscious decisions  To eat nothing but junk  Yeah  And Big Macs and all that  And then hide behind the excuse  That you're addicted to food  That's ridiculous  You know I can't have a drink  I can't have a drug  If I have one I'm done  But now George brought up the point 
[02:58:00]  Before about  You have to eat food  You don't have to do drugs  He said if you have one drink  You know it's over  But if you eat food  You have to eat everyday  Jimmy  You take cold medicine  Right?  Not with alcohol  No I know  But you do take cold medicine  Yes  Which is  Like a pill  Yeah and somebody who's a drug addict  They can take some over the counter drugs  Because they're reasonable people  That know what limitations there are  What I'm saying is  It's the same thing with food  You can look at the food 
[02:58:30]  And say I can take a healthy type of food  Right  I don't have to binge because I'm an addict  You know if you're a drug addict  You could still take some over the counter drugs  And not go into this full blown relapse  Well if you melt it down and shoot it  Then that's a problem  Right  You're right  You're right  Medication and stuff like that  I mean that's a very individual thing  And it's like  That's a real tough decision sometimes  Like when you've got to take  Very rarely will I ever take a narcotic  Unless I have absolute pain  Like if they provide  And I'll always take less than I have to 
[02:59:00]  It's all motives  It's all like what are my motives  Am I doing this  And you can only lie to yourself  You want to lie to yourself  Go ahead  I'm taking something  Because I'm genuinely sick  And I'm genuinely in pain  But I can't mess with alcohol cough medicine  I can't do it  I've done it  I can't do it  If they say you know  The doctor says one every four hours  And you're taking seven every four hours  Right  Then you're you know  You made a conscious decision to relapse  That's basically  Alright  Well I see it as some kind of mental disorder  Or affliction  That's not wrong dude  You're not wrong  As this physical disease  It's both 
[02:59:30]  There is a physical combination too though  Alright let's go to Scott in Jersey  Scott  Yeah how you doing guys  Hey  I'm all over what Anthony's got to say  It's just bullshit  You've got to make a decision  It's a disease or an addiction  You know  And like Anthony says  You can't tell somebody that's got cancer  That I'm fat because I've got a disease  It's just bullshit  Yeah  I'm not saying even you're wrong  But there are different kinds of diseases  Like you have to understand  If there's no physical thing  Why do people die going through alcohol withdrawals?  I mean why do people shake until they have a first drink? 
[03:00:00]  There is a physical element to this sickness  It's not just a bunch of dumbbells who can't say no  There is a balance  I'm saying there's a physical  There's something physical to it  But it's the alcohol  It's the drug  It's not some enzyme  You know  It's not something your body is creating on it's own  It's the alcohol and the drugs you put in it  And the body's reaction to it detoxing itself  It's what you put in it  That's screwing it up  That's making the shakes  That's what  We're making the shakes 
[03:00:30]  But what actually causes the mania for the alcohol  The mania of all this stuff  Goes way beyond the actual substance  And they're actually starting to look  I don't know what it is that makes you  Physiologically  We don't know that yet  We know tumors, cancer  But look at all the things we don't know about cancer  You know  Why do you get it if you don't smoke?  There's a million things about cancer we don't know  A lot of stuff about alcoholism and drug addiction we don't know  But they're starting to think that it's something  A chemical release in the brain  So what if they find out  Let's just play devil's advocate  And find out that it is a physical thing that happens  That causes you to develop this type of a thing 
[03:01:00]  That you then  Well it's hereditary  It can be yeah  Alcoholism is hereditary  It's what?  It's hereditary  I heard hereditary  I heard hereditary  I heard hereditary  You left the H off hereditary  It's only a letter  It's only a letter  Alright, Andrew Higgins  You really are an homo  It's hereditary, eh?  Ain't it, Gardner?  We got Itch Voss in the studio today  Jesus  I thought I was dead  Oh my god  Hereditary  I at least try to pronounce the letters 
[03:01:30]  Some mother fur  Oh my lord  Wow  Wow  It's hereditary  Alright, let's go to Brandy  You're no doctor  Brandy's from Oklahoma  5'4", 180 pounds  Brandy  Yes, hello  Hi  Hi  I can hear the fatness through the phone  Oh  She sent an email with gravy on it  Go ahead, sweetie  I talked  I guess it's really good I can't hear you  No, what's up?  Go ahead  It's okay  I just want to say that last caller was such a douche  Why?  I agree with Anthony completely 
[03:02:00]  Ooh  I've had drinking issues  And I knew to put it down because I was on the road to becoming a horrible alcoholic  Uh huh  I've been fat all my life, but you know what? I know to put the damn Twinkie down sometimes  Uh huh  Not if you're still fat  Yeah, but not all the time do I put the Twinkie down  And not, by the way, knowledge is no defense  Yeah  A lot of people, I knew smoking was bad, but I continue to do it, so knowledge is nice to have, but it's not an action  Do you drink every once in a while, though, have a wine or something? 
[03:02:30]  No  Not at all?  Nothing  Nothing?  I have not drank in probably about four to five years  How about marijuana?  Nope  I am a smoker, though, which makes it even worse  It's like I just transfer my addiction and that's all it is, is an addiction  You know, how come the addictions are always for great stuff?  Let me tell you something, smoking rocks, kids  It feels good, it's cool, don't let them kid you, it does make you look cool 
[03:03:00]  And it's just a fun thing to do with your hand while you're drinking in a bar somewhere  It's very good  Things that make people fat, you don't see these fatties that are my addiction  You don't see them wailing down huge piles of broccoli and bell peppers  It's always the sweet stuff, the stuff that tastes good  Alcohol, drugs, that shit makes you feel great  Well, same with sugar, too  Yeah, but that kind of comes from what I was saying  Why isn't anyone addicted to putting a hammer across their face a few times a day? 
[03:03:30]  Well, that may be  Some people are  A lot of people are  A lot of people have amputee sicknesses  They cut their own fingers off  I mean, they, you know  They cut themselves, too  Yeah, absolutely  Cutters  For the most part, you find a lot of people with these addictions are fat people  Because they like to taste the cake  Yeah  Once it goes beyond  And that's where you're right  That's the beauty of addiction  You gotta give it to addiction  It knows what it's doing  It ropes you in with this great shit  But when you're drinking and missing work  When you've lost your wife  When you're gambling and you lose your house  No intelligent person says 
[03:04:00]  You continue long after the party was over  And that's what the addiction is  That's what the sickness is  It's like, believe me  If I could just fucking drink and have a good time  And oh, I got silly last night  I farted and pointed at someone and laughed  But you know, when I was drinking and cutting myself with a razor  And going, I got  What the fuck am I doing?  And I'm still drinking  That's the mania  That's the insanity  Nobody wants to drunk drive and kill people  And yet people do it and they continue to drink  It's insanity  That's what Peter was in for in Oz  Good point, Jimmy  Yeah, I mean, it's like 
[03:04:30]  It goes long beyond where the party stops  Alright, Brandy  Yeah, I just wanted to say that  I have recently found the Opie and Anthony diet  Oh  And my goal is to lose all the way that I can  So I can play what's in my pants  That's right, we make you sick  Thank you  The Opie and Anthony diet  I fucking love it  If you have sex with Jim Norton  And whatever he gives you  Causes you to lose weight  Long beyond where you want to  I love you, Norton  You're back  Thank you, sir  Thank you, Bob  Brandy, we hear this feather thing helps though  As far as, you know, purging out all the food 
[03:05:00]  That's right  Yeah  That's what I learned today  For all those fatties out there  Looking for a new way to  For a new way to lose weight  Those fatty  Those  Those people complaining  Whatever that organization  How come they don't complain  About those shows like Biggest Loser  You're still making fun of fat people  Trying to, you know  Mm-hmm  It's all just a freak show  Freddie B from Philly  What happened to the phrase  Bad habit?  Remember when it was just a bad habit?  Yeah  Now everyone's got groups  And organizations  And they're empowered  And it  He used to just be 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, that guy's got a bad habit  He's gotta kick it  How did you kick that habit?  Goddamn, good  Let's go to Clay in Vegas  Clay  Nah, he hung up  A bad habit?  Only because there are people  That when they're drug addicted enough  Will suck a cock to get the  And that goes a little beyond bad habit  Yeah  Nobody puts the dick of a stranger in their mouth  To fund a bad habit  That looks like a bad habit over there  My goodness, look what he's doing  Gotta kick that  You don't need drugs so bad  You're like, alright, come here  Alright, thank you for the 20 
[03:06:00]  That's a bad habit  That's a bad habit  Oh, Jesus  Picking your nose is a bad habit  Alright  Picking jism out of it  Yeah  Hi, this is Jay Moore  And I'm supposed to say something witty and funny here  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony  And...  And...  And...  Suck it  Fuck, I can't do it, Steve  Opie and Anthony, XM202  Hey guys, bad 911 calls  Yes  People call 911 for ridiculous things 
[03:06:30]  One lady called 911 because Burger King can't get her order right  I've been waiting for this replay  Because I thought this was really, really funny  Yes  This call  Because Burger King didn't get her order right or something  She called 911, right?  Yep  Or is this the one...  Oh, and then there's another call  That's right  It led to another 911 call  911 call  Where a mom called because she couldn't control her kids  Wasn't that the first one we played?  Was the mom that couldn't control the kids and the 911 operator made a little joke? 
[03:07:00]  Made a little joke  And then we played the Burger King one  You know what? I really don't know  We really don't know  Well, why don't we listen and learn?  Alrighty  Here's Opie and Anthony when they don't suck  Good for what ails you, what what?  The worst of Opie and Anthony  I want to play this 911 thing for Tracy  I know, I want to hear some of this  Because Tracy, you're a parent  Do your kids fight a lot?  Mm-mm  They do long  No fighting?  They do not whoop their ass  That's true  It's usually like this call is, the 911 call 
[03:07:30]  It's the 911 call  It's this white trash  From the south  And they call the cops all the time  Because of these god damn kids fighting  Which is no reason to call the god damn cops  Is this grown up gutty?  No, this is a 911 call  This woman is very angry at the 911 operator  Because he tried to make a little joke  He tried to make  It's a great joke  It's a great joke  Now if you're a 911 operator  You probably shouldn't be making jokes at all  I think they should 
[03:08:00]  Because I think they hear a lot of shit  But I got to tell you  I got into a little argument  With my girlfriend last night  About this call  I played it  And the first thing I said was  This friggin' bitch  Should shut her mouth  She's trash  She should do some parenting  The whole thing is  Her kids are fighting  She's got two daughters  One's 12, one's 14  They're fighting  And from the call  I assume  They're done fighting  She said they were fighting  One of them kicked a hole in the door  And you don't call the cops for this 
[03:08:30]  You grab them by the hair  You bang their heads together  You do whatever you gotta do  The cops are busy  They don't need this  And the only reason  The 911 operator made the joke  Is because he's probably heard this  A thousand times  It's not serious  It's not like he was joking  That one daughter fell on a knife  And she's bleeding  And he's making jokes  This is two white trash girls  Pulling each other's hair  And this bitch is wasting cops time  By calling  That's it  So he makes a little joke  Then after the joke  This woman gets so pissed  And she is rag and severe 
[03:09:00]  Now she's getting the guy's name  She's gonna report him  This, that  Now the fight is a total backseat  Now it's not an emergency  To call the cops  If this was an emergency  Where she should've called the cops  And he made a joke  She would've blown off the joke  And said hey look  It's an emergency  I'm very pissed at what you said  I'm gonna deal with you  But look  I got an emergency  Send the cops  She completely forgets about the emergency  That she was calling the cops for  And now her whole life  Is getting this guy in trouble  And the guy also  When you hear it  Right after the joke 
[03:09:30]  The guy realizes  In a second  You hear a second  When he realizes  Uh oh, I fucked up  And he starts the apology wagon  Yeah  But it don't work  It's a very interesting call  Yeah, she's gonna cause trouble now  You gotta hear this Tracy  Let's go to this call real fast  It's a shorty  911, what is your emergency?  Yes  I need a police officer over here  What's going on?  I've got two teenage daughters  And I just got home from work  They were physically fighting with each other  And one of them kicked a hole in a door 
[03:10:00]  And they're 12 and almost 14  And the 12 year old is completely out of control  And I can't physically, if she's as big as I am  I can't control her  Okay, did you want us to come over to shoot her?  Ha ha ha ha ha  Yeah  There it is  See that's  That's the joke  Ha ha ha ha ha  Alright  That's the joke  Ha ha ha ha  Now  Look  She's laughing during the fucking call  She's saying  Look 
[03:10:30]  I just got home from work  This isn't an emergency  This is not a reason to call 911  911  911  Very important  It's very important  You don't want to cross the lines  Right  Call your husband  Call the neighbor  Knock their friggin' heads together  You don't call 911 for this  And she's laughing  I got home from work  This isn't an emergency  So the guy makes a joke  Is she laughing? I didn't hear that  I didn't catch that  At the beginning she goes  She's kind of like that nervous titter  Like I just  Like she's almost trying to justify this 
[03:11:00]  Can I just say this one more time?  I can't believe this  Absolutely  We'll play it from the beginning again  And let it roll all the way through  Fuck  Here we go  Here it is again  911 what is your emergency?  Yes  I need a police officer over here  What's going on?  I've got two teenage daughters  And I just got home from work  Right there  They were physically fighting with each other  And one of them kicked a hole in a door  And they're 12 and almost 14  And the 12 year old is completely out of control 
[03:11:30]  And I can't physically, if she's as big as I am  I can't control her  Okay  Did you want us to come over to shoot her?  Are you there?  Excuse me?  That's a joke  Okay  Who are you?  What is your name?  I hate her  I hate her  Now that's where he  I hate her  That's where he realized  Uh oh, I fucked up  And you hear him trying to cover  What was the emergency again?  What's the emergency again?  911  What's the problem with us?  Can I help you?  She needs a stiff one 
[03:12:00]  You're right  And now the emergency takes a complete backseat to her and her new mission  Which is getting this guy in trouble  Why did this dumbass answer the question?  He should have just hung up the phone  Yeah  Which is bad to do on a 911 call  I know  But you know what?  You gotta feed your own family  Hang up the phone, stupid  He was probably feeling good, you know  He was having a good day at work  Right, right  He said, what the hell?  Let me throw this one out  He knew it wasn't an emergency  Right, exactly  That's what it is  He knew because he's done this thousands of times  He knows this call  Now, also, I'm not saying the guy isn't an idiot 
[03:12:30]  You're a 911 operator  It's not time to do open mic night, you know  You're trying out some new material  You're trying out some new shit on the 911 operator  How out of control is she?  I owe the 12-year-old money and I'm dodging her  It's probably not a wise thing for this guy to test out his new stuff  Good point, Anthony  Good point  But that doesn't stop  That doesn't give her a reason to now turn into a mission 
[03:13:00]  This mission she has now to get the guy in trouble  She turned into the Incredible Hulk, man  She did  All of a sudden now, emergency is emergency  It's so funny because it was just that moment of silence  It's like she's on the phone  You can just see her face like looking at the receiver like  Oh, yeah  Well, if we could go back a little more and get to the part where  That's about it  That's about it  Where you realize  That same attitude probably cause a divorce  Right  And the reason why her kids are animals  The backlash 
[03:13:30]  The backlash of the divorce  There you go  The kids are out of control  Here, let's go back to the tape  Here it is  The uncomfortableness  Are you there?  Excuse me  That's a joke  Okay  Who are you?  What is your name?  Mike Forbus  Okay, that's not funny, Mike  I'm sorry  I'm going to file a formal complaint  That's  I don't blame you a bit  Hey, because you know what?  This is really not very funny  I know it's not, ma'am  I apologize  Well, guess what?  It's not going to be very funny when I go in front of your supervisor  And tell him 
[03:14:00]  I understand  I guess he can just listen to the tape  Yes, he can  I'm sorry  No, it's great  There's another call  There's another call  Excuse me, lady  Which is probably real 911 calls  Like, yeah  Help me, help me  Yeah, I got a guy  Yeah, there's some electrocuted worker up on a line somewhere  That's the best part  You hear the phone ring in the background  And this guy's like  Fuck that  I gotta save my job now  And there's real trouble on that other line  Yes, I'm an asshole woman  Yes, you're right  I'm going to file a complaint  I don't blame you, ma'am  I don't blame you, I guess  Why would he give his name? 
[03:14:30]  What a dummy  He actually went by the book here  And that'll probably save him  That might save him  That might save him  If he doesn't  You know, if they don't just blow him off completely  Just for doing what he did  If there's any chance of being saved  The fact that he did apologize  Gave his name  Here it is  And not just, you know, hang up and hide  Like one of those prank calls gone bad when you're a kid  It's like, you know  Wow  You've got ten pound balls  Yeah  How do you walk?  I got caller ID  Your phone number is 516  Quick, you hang up and wait in the corner for your pop to come home and punch you 
[03:15:00]  I can't believe somebody would do something like that, man  I know, yeah  That's terrible  Just listen, I think it's hilarious to hear the phone ring in the background  It's another call coming out  I know  This guy's supposed to answer  Go ahead  Mike Forbus  Okay, that's not funny, Mike  I'm sorry  I'm going to file a formal complaint  That's  I don't blame you a bit  Hey, because you know what?  This is really not very funny  I know it's not, ma'am  I apologize  Well, guess what?  It's not going to be very funny when I go in front of your supervisor and tell him  I understand  I guess he can just listen to the tape 
[03:15:30]  Yes, he can  I'm sorry  I apologize  Hold on one second  Hold on one second  Hold on  Three  Hold on  Yeah  Ma'am?  Yeah?  Okay  12 and...  10 and 12 or 12 and 14?  12 and 13 and a half  Okay  All right  Get police officers on the way  They're on an emergency call right now  But as soon as I can get one free, I'll get them on the way  Oh, well, don't rush or anything 
[03:16:00]  Well, I apologize  I apologize for my smart remark  And I will get them in route as soon as I can  Okay, and what is your name again?  Mike Forvis  My number 605  Thank you  Yes, ma'am  Ma'am  There's some crazy people out there, man  Don't rush or anything  Yeah, don't send them away for maybe a car wreck or something  Don't rush  Send them over here and parent  And parent for me  You're a parent  Bang their heads together  I'm with you, aunt  Thank you  She's totally frustrated, man  Bipolar 
[03:16:30]  Calling the cops  I guarantee you she's a divorcee too, man  Oh, absolutely  That dude wasn't putting up with that  No  Imagine that  Husband walks home  How you doing?  Yeah, had a hard day at work there, honey  Oh, hard?  Not as hard as me  I had to deal with these two  Oh, shut up  And she probably threatens the kid with the cops all the time and never calls them  Right  And they're like, ah, shut up, Paul  I'm calling you  Because you did  Well, I will call 9-1-1  You know, 9-1-1  Somebody should just like put a little piece of fecal matter on her car  I agree, Ron 
[03:17:00]  Two weeks straight  Two weeks straight  9-1-1 is for emergencies  9-1-1 is not a joke  There you go  Thank you  Can we get it?  I wish we could have a follow up on what happened with this guy  I know  Because now all these radio stations are playing it  He is cooked  It's pretty, like, recent news  He's finished  I know  Mike Forbus  Yeah, poor Mike Forbus  He got, like, huge like that, man  I don't know  Now he's, you know  We should support him  We should support him  Because 9-1-1 is there for emergencies 
[03:17:30]  And that does not  That is not an emergency  He said the police are out right now on an emergency call  They'll get there when they can  And she said that they're not fighting anymore  Yeah  They're not fighting  So what, the cops gotta go over there now and give them a talk?  No, you listen to your mom  And no fighting  Meanwhile, there's shit going on down the road  There's probably some, you know  Somebody's cat is up in a tree  Oh, some real emergency  Some prostitutes getting armed, though  He gave her a little, you know 
[03:18:00]  Hey, you call 9-1-1 with this crap  And I'm gonna joke about it  It was so awkward, though  Because he's like  You want us to shoot him?  And she's quiet  Look, I didn't mean that  I'm sorry  He felt like he could get away  I think he felt like he could get away with the line, huh?  Yeah  It was a great line, too  It wouldn't be a bad idea  You know, it wouldn't be a bad idea  Hey, this is Adam Ferrari  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony  The worst  It's absolutely awful  Enjoy it  Hey, you have an update on the 9-1-1 guy? 
[03:18:30]  Yes, I have an update  That gentleman that made that little joke about  Come over and shoot her  He was reprimanded, Opie  Reprimanded  He's a dispatcher for five years at the  Watauga Department of Public Safety  Where's that? Washington?  Let's see where that is  They had to reprimand him for the joke, right?  They had to reprimand him  They had to, right?  They did  But they didn't fire him  Good  You know what, Anthony?  He got a letter 
[03:19:00]  We've been in this situation  Oh, yeah  Tell him what happened  He got a letter  From Police Chief David Van Laar  He wrote to the operator  This type of response cannot be tolerated  And this letter shall serve as notice  That any future unprofessional responses  While answering the 9-1-1 line  Will be cause for termination  And we  We've been there  Know what happened with this guy?  We've gotten this same letter  Behind closed doors  His superiors were going  Hey, dude, that's really funny  And, you know  We understand 
[03:19:30]  We know this job sucks at times  But  We've got to make it look good out there  So we're going to give you this  We've been through these discussions  We're going to  We're going to  Release this letter  You know  To calm everyone the fuck down  But let me tell you  And pat him on the back going  Dude, that was really funny  Right  I guarantee that's what happened  Exactly  You guys knew  You guys knew  You was coming back to radio though  Did we?  Yeah  Really?  That was great, man  People listening to you guys, man  You get us going in the morning, man  Hey, Steve brought in another complaint call 
[03:20:00]  Yes  What?  Another 9-1-1  Yeah  Another  There's a woman calling the cops  Because of a problem she had  With her Burger King order  Uh-oh  What?  That's what Steve's telling me  I'm a little worried that everything's okay  Can you believe these people?  The cops  Cops  You know  I love when they go around  And just throw people beatings  Use the tasers when they're not supposed to  Things like that  Because the shit they gotta put up with sometimes  And a woman calls 9-1-1 
[03:20:30]  Somebody could be dying  But please respond to this woman  Who didn't her burger order went awry  That's apartment  How can I help you?  Yeah, I'm over here  I'm over here at Burger King  Right here in San Quimini  Uh-huh  No, not San Quimini  I'm sorry  I live in San Quimini  I'm in Maguna Niguel I think  That's where I'm at  Uh-huh  I ordered my food three times  They're mopping the floor inside  And I understand they're busy  They're not even busy  Okay, I've been in the only car here  I asked them four different times  To make me a western barbecue burger  Okay 
[03:21:00]  They keep giving me a hamburger  With lettuce, tomato, and cheese, onions  And I said, I'm not leaving  Uh-huh  I want a western burger  Because I just got my kids from Taekwondo  They're hungry  I'm on my way home  And I live in San Quimini  Uh-huh  Okay  She gave me another hamburger  It's wrong  I said four times  I said, I want it  Can you go out and park in front?  And I said, no  I want my hamburger right  So then the lady came to the manager  Or whoever she is  She came up  And she said, um  She said, um  Do you want your money back?  And I said, no  I want my hamburger  My kids are hungry 
[03:21:30]  And I have to jump on the toll freeway  I said, I am not leaving this spot  And I said, I will call the police  Because I want my western burger done right  Holy crap  Can you even believe?  That people are just hopeless, pathetic people that do shit like that  Yeah, yeah  This woman obviously needs a life  The way she's babbling  Just babbling  She needs an outlet  She needs someone to talk to  You think that's frustrations?  That is an absolute frustration  She's dealing with her little kids all day  Nope  What? What, Opie? 
[03:22:00]  No  She thinks her shit don't stink  You think she's so important  She's one of these rich bitches in a big SUV event  San Clemente Laguna Niguel  Yeah  Very well to do area  I disagree  I think that when you order a burger and you want something specifically  If it's not done, the police should be called  You are an ass  She has a fine life  Oh my gosh  But you're an asshole  You're an asshole  This woman has a fine life that looks down on people  Maybe you didn't hear specifically, oh, but she'd requested the burger more than once  The western, she said western barbecue 
[03:22:30]  Right, western  She wanted the western barbecue  And they're in there mopping the floors  Yes  They're in there mopping the floors  She asked four times  She asked four times  In there mopping the floors  That's right  Uncircumcised I'll bet  And she picked a little lad up from Taekwondo  And he wanted a burger  A western as Tracy pointed out  And he's not getting the burger  Well there's more  Uh oh  Now is that so hard?  Okay, what exactly is it you want us to do for you?  I send the officers down here  I want them to make me provide  Sam, we're not going to go down there and enforce your western bacon cheeseburger 
[03:23:00]  Good  What am I supposed to do?  This is between you and the manager  We're not going to enforce how to make a hamburger  That's why  That's not a criminal issue  There's nothing criminal  So I just stand here  So I just sit here  You need to calmly and rationally speak to the manager  And figure out what to do between you  She did come up and I said can I please have my western burger  She's a spoiled bitch  I would so quickly tell this bitch to shut up  Can you hear it now Anthony?  I just can't believe it man  I just can't believe it  I'm listening to this  I can't believe it 
[03:23:30]  That people are out there like  Yeah  Well maybe you didn't hear that she already spoke to the manager  And she said she wanted her western burger  And the issue wasn't resolved  That's what 9-1-1 is there for  She want the cops to come and make her burger for her  Yeah, making the burger for her  That's right  What did she expect the cops to  What scenario played out in this woman's head  When she fantasized what would happen after this call  The cops come screaming up  Dude, she's one of those chicks that want to take somebody down 
[03:24:00]  That's it, right?  Yeah man, they want to take somebody down man  Throwing people on the floor, cuffing them  You're going down  You make that burger  Yeah  You make that burger for this bitch  You're going down  Yeah  Unbelievable  There was a breaking news last night  Desperate housewives didn't come on  Please send somebody over here  Why not?  Please  The rational call  Desperate housewives didn't come on last night  We need somebody over here now 
[03:24:30]  Yes, and my father's cut his finger off  But never mind that  He's okay  Unbelievable  I can't believe it  The problem with all of you is that you hate women  And you're not addressing the issue  She asked for her burger to be done a certain way  She's in the drive-thru  Shut up  Shut up  She picked  Had a hard day  Picked the kids up from Taekwondo  From Taekwondo  Alright, let's go back to the call  There's more  Of course there is  He said I'm not dealing with  She walked away  Because they're mopping the floor 
[03:25:00]  And it's all full of beds  And they don't want to run  They don't want to go through there  And  Ma'am, then I suggest you get your money back  And go somewhere else  This is not a criminal issue  We can't go out there  And make them make you a cheeseburger the way you want it  Well  That is  That  You're supposed to be here to protect me  Well, what are we protecting you from?  Oh, man  This woman has never been told no in her life  You're supposed to be here to protect me  She's absolutely right  Shut up  The police are there 
[03:25:30]  To make things right  And she's not being protected  Drop the mop  And pick up the burger  Drop it  Make this woman her burger  Or we'll send in the SWAT team  Maybe you don't realize  But Burger Kings are the ones that said  Have it your way  Oh, well, now  Well, hey  Now I might have to agree with Jimmy  Did she make that up?  Now I might have to agree with Jimmy  Not have it our way while we avoid suds  Have it your way  Suds on the floor  That's right  Have it your way  Well, now you might have turned me down 
[03:26:00]  What happened with the rest of the soap?  That is  That  You're supposed to be here to protect me  Well, what are we protecting you from?  A wrong cheeseburger?  No  It's just like  Is this a harmful cheeseburger or something?  I don't understand what you want us to do  Well, just come down here  I'm not leaving  No, ma'am  I'm not sending the deputies down there over a cheeseburger  You need to go in there and act like an adult  And either get your money back and go home  I'm not asking like an adult herself  I'm sitting here in my car  I just want them to make my kids a Westenburger  Now this is what I suggest 
[03:26:30]  I suggest you get your money back from the manager  And you go on your way home  Okay  Okay  Bye-bye  Good  Yeah  Nice  Good  I hope that operator was reprimanded  What are we protecting you from a bad cheeseburger?  I think she understands the problems in the service industry  And I didn't like her attitude at all  Really?  It's not professional  You asshole  Look, you guys can do what you want  She should have sent the deputies down  And they should have dragged this woman out of the truck  And then raped her mouth 
[03:27:00]  Just raped her mouth  They absolutely should have sent the car down there  And arrested the woman making that call  Yes  For tying up police resources  That should be obstruction of justice  Absolutely  There should be some kind  Penalty  That woman should have been put in jail  Her kids should have been taken away from her  Because she obviously isn't responsible enough to have children  And they should have had their little taekwondo uniforms ripped off  While they were bodily searched for evidence of burger malfunctions 
[03:27:30]  Send them to Neverland  Have Michael watch that while she sorts out her legal problems  Just open that little yellow belt  And rip down those little white taekwondo slacks  These women are divorcees, man  Yep  They've got to be frustrated  No, I think this woman  I don't think she was divorced  I don't think there's any frustration in her personality  I think this woman is married  Her husband probably knows nothing about her  Doesn't care about her  It's a loveless marriage  She's got the kids  She's got some cash  Living down there in Laguna Niguel  Or San Clemente 
[03:28:00]  Nice area in Southern California  She drives home to her big house  She has a husband that doesn't even talk to her  She doesn't talk to him  Yeah  So she's probably lonely  She's spoiled rotten  She does get everything she wants  But she doesn't get the attention that she needs  Right, right  So this was reaching out for attention  And being spoiled and trying to get what she wants  And what she should have gotten was an egg sandwich in a cell  That crappy egg sandwich they give you  Right, Jimmy?  You know what that tastes like, don't you?  No, well, we had bologna when I was in the school 
[03:28:30]  Bologna?  Oh, the afternoon menu  That's right  I didn't know they changed that over  But I didn't eat it  Because I had a log  The size of Heather Mill's leg  Logged in my colon  Imagine if I take one bite of anything  I'm going to shit my pants  In a jail cell  Yeah, you don't want to be  30 crips  Yeah, it was really awful  Oh my goodness  30 crips  I don't want to be doing that  But that woman absolutely should have been there  Is that amazing?  Arrested  It's the type of woman  That you just want to see somebody drink  Like five Pabst blue ribbons  Not even a good alcohol  A bad stinky breath 
[03:29:00]  Wow  A real  Like I drank eleven Meister Brows  And I plowed into her car with a bulldozer  I don't know what happened  But I'm sorry that she can't move below the neck ever again  Little bloody geese in the backseat strapped in  That's right  That's right  Two yellow belts and a million questions of what could have been  Somehow in the  Somehow  Somehow  In the wreckage  A little Barney video is still playing on the screen of the SUV  I love  I love  It sounds like 
[03:29:30]  A little skip  Shrek 2  Just still playing as the bloody geese are strapped safely in their seats  The little character is still talking  No idea that there's two headless geese staring at him  You see a little Westenburger roll across the street  Still in its package  That's right  The woman is  The last thing she ever did was clutch the bag with the burgers she didn't want in it  That's it  A couple of sudsy Mexicans try to help her out of the wreckage  That's right  How ironic  She can't feel anything below the neck so they squeeze her tits while she stares openly 
[03:30:00]  Like she's on succinylcholine  Like the exorcist 3  Lady we hate you  Wow  Just a filthy burrito breath in her face  See  Well that's the way we play out what would have happened  They just give it a little squeeze while the police come  The Opie and Anthony Show  Is that her name?  Whose name?  Why we uh  What?  Because we uh  We were just talking about it in real life 
[03:30:30]  Not in this fake tape thing that we do  Can't you keep up the illusion for one lousy day?  No we're not here  One lousy day  This is fake  It's not fake  If we were here we'd be doing a show  Oh yeah  Not introing this stuff  Good point Anthony  Good point  Thank you  This is the day Billy Joel  Uh was released from rehab  Yeah  Take a wild fucking guess  What does that mean?
