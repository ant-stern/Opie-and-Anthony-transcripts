<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a defiant rejection of "nice" radio, launching into rambling banter and a poorly executed intro.  They discussed *Kid Nation*, with Opie mentioning his niece's friend winning a prize, sparking reminiscences about their own abusive summer camp experiences, filled with dark humor and vulgar anecdotes.  This segued into stories about topless sunbathers and awkward childhood encounters with girls, revealing insecurities and regrets.  The hosts shared numerous personal stories of childhood failures and romantic mishaps, peppered with crude humor and offensive language.  They touched upon Ike Turner's death and the upcoming Mitchell Report on steroid use in baseball. Listener calls from Scott and Ray corroborated Anthony's negative summer camp experiences. The segment ended with a discussion of the hosts' regrets and an announcement of Anthony reading letters from a past long-distance relationship.


The show continued with a discussion of the Mitchell Report, featuring jokes about players hitting tumors.  This transitioned into commentary on Kiefer Sutherland's imprisonment and humorous speculation about his jail behavior.  Sports commentary followed, focusing on the New York Knicks, Jets, and Patriots, with controversial opinions and discussions of their fan bases.  This was followed by a discussion of a woman's large HIV misdiagnosis settlement, contrasted with a smaller settlement in an Isaiah Thomas sexual harassment case.  The hosts then discussed a study on distrust between minority groups, before dedicating significant time to the aftermath of E-Rock's cinnamon challenge, including its online popularity and potential legal repercussions.  Further segments covered glow-in-the-dark cloned cats, a caller suggesting glow-in-the-dark deer, and Led Zeppelin's reunion.  A lengthy discussion about holiday tipping in one host's building highlighted the perceived pressure and cost.  The segment concluded with a caller interaction and the playing of an audio clip of a man's angry post office outburst.


A significant portion of this segment focused on the aforementioned post office outburst video. The hosts and callers dissected the man's aggressive behavior and profanity, speculating on the provocation and potential employee culpability.  The conversation broadened to customer service interactions, reactions to frustrating situations, and the lack of bystander intervention.  One host recounted a physical altercation with a cab driver, while another shared frustrations with inconsiderate people in lines.  They also discussed E-Rock's cinnamon challenge video, playing a humorous audio edit portraying his first day in prison.  Time Magazine's "Top 10 Cringeworthy Moments of 2007" were discussed, including moments from Britney Spears, Rudy Giuliani's children, and David Hasselhoff.  The hosts detailed plans for a "Tranathlon" contest, using offensive language, and introduced a new game, "Name That Poon," involving identifying celebrities in sex tapes, using highly offensive and sexually suggestive descriptions.  Audio clips from these tapes were played.


This segment featured a game where, with guest Jimmy, the hosts guessed the identities of women in pornographic video clips based on Opie's vulgar clues.  The clues focused on the women's sexual performance and physical attributes.  The women included Gina Lynn, Paris Hilton, Jenny Piccolo, Jenna Lewis, Beverly D'Angelo, and Halle Berry.  Short segments of the videos were played to reveal answers, with Opie winning.  Following the game, they speculated about which New York Yankees players would be implicated in the Mitchell Report, using humorous and crude speculation about steroid use.  The show concluded with a promotion for the "Money Honey" contest, involving nudity and honey, a discussion about a producer fired for a controversial bit ("Queer Eye for the Retarded Guy"), and a promotion for the O&A Shorts podcast.  The broadcast ended with more vulgar banter and a bizarre, unrelated audio clip.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their offense.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock shots, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock shots, Opie and Anthony.  Shock shots, Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock shots, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock shots, Opie and Anthony.  What?  Hold on.  Whose fault was that delay?  No.  No.  Is it?  Correct, open, humiliate.  What do you mean right in front of me?  When you just end like that, I had to tie it up.  Dude, I looked at you and went, boom, like go.  That was sloppy.  If you had to say a celebrity that you most resemble, who would you say?  Jodie Foster? 
[00:01:00]  If she ate the real Jodie Foster.  Silence of the hams.  This is where entertainment is going.  I do not touch that.  The only things that may touch that is toilet paper and baby wipes.  I am right now.  Oh my God.  They are sick.  Freaks.  How close did you get to having relations with a dog?  You have to put oven mitts on all the German shepherds so we don't scratch bars up.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial. 
[00:01:30]  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  That intro makes us chuckle.  Off in mitts.  Damn you, Jimmy.  They do that in those awful movies to keep the people from being scratched up.  The German shepherd has to have mitts on because they get so excited they'll just grab the person and pull up the side.  The old dewclaw.  Walking around doing that horrible shaking of foot every time they take a step. 
[00:02:00]  Not understanding.  And here we are.  Hey.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Good morning.  Coming at you.  Good morning.  Good morning to everybody.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A. 
[00:02:30]  We love taking your calls.  They have begun calling already.  On our program.  They don't got much to say, but they're calling already.  Rob in New Jersey.  What's up, buddy?  Good morning, guys.  How are you?  Real good, Rob.  It's awful chilly up today, huh?  Yeah, it's awfully chilly.  This morning.  Yeah.  It's winter.  Yeah.  How were your nights?  My night was pretty good. 
[00:03:00]  I shed almost a tear watching the finale of Kid Nation.  God!  I missed the finale of Kid Nation.  If you need to know.  Oh, wait a minute.  That's right.  I don't care.  Oh.  Phew.  That was close.  Just a little bit of a...  Almost a tear.  It was like kind of welling up, and then I was able to control my emotion.  And my, yes, thank you, E-Rock.  My niece's very good friend, Sophia, won $50,000 last night on Kid Nation.  She was the big winner? 
[00:03:30]  She got an extra big gold star.  Yeah?  So she won?  They were giving out gold stars all season long that were worth like $20,000 last night.  They gave away $50,000 gold stars.  Yeah.  And Sophia, Kelly's friend down there in Orlando, won one of the big 50 grand gold stars.  Were they got to take these things to smelters or something and melt them down?  What are they going to do with these gold stars, man?  They were living in here.  Take it to Toys R Us and just lay it on the counter?  They were living in an old mining town. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Like a deserted mining town.  I don't know.  It was like the Old West.  They'll figure it out.  Were they all upset to leave each other?  Yeah.  A lot of hugging and crying?  Yeah, that's what got me a little bit.  Aw.  Because I've gone to like camp.  Why don't you sit down in that seat right there and tell me about it?  Have some lemonade.  It brought me back to being a kid and you go to camp or something and you hang out with  these people for like a week, two weeks and you think like...  You went through the NOM together?  Yeah, and it's just a week of playing, you know, dumb sports and canoeing and crap. 
[00:04:30]  And making pottery on days it rains.  And then your parents come and then you say goodbye and even as a little kid you realize,  oh no, I'll never see these people again.  I'm real sad.  I'm real sad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm extremely sad.  This is...  I don't know what this means.  But if you really step back and think about it, you know, especially if you went to camp  as a kid, it was only a stupid week in your life.  Who cares if you don't see these people ever again? 
[00:05:00]  I went to summer camp so it was longer than that.  It was like...  You got to go all summer?  Yeah, it was pretty much the whole summer at what was called the Paul Bunyan Day Camp.  Ew.  When I was living in Central Islip.  Paul Bunyan Day Camp.  Babe the Blue Ox.  Wait, was it on Long Island?  Yeah, yeah.  So you didn't even get to go away?  No, we had to take a bus there.  But it was just like...  It wasn't that far.  It was in the middle of the woods somewhere.  And the counselors were all a bunch of pot-smoking dope fiends. 
[00:05:30]  So you took a bus a couple exits down the highway to camp?  Yeah.  That's not going to summer camp.  You have to go over a bridge and start going up the mountains and stuff.  No, we came home every day.  Ew.  It was day camp.  You didn't even get to sleep over with all your hormones going crazy in your body?  No, no.  I think I was a little young for the hormone things going crazy, but... 
[00:06:00]  Oh, my God.  It was day camp.  So we take a bus there, and then they bus us back.  That's summer camp for poor people.  For poor people.  We tend to live in clusters.  Right.  Yeah, it was real boring, too.  Like, after the first week, they ran out of stuff for us to do.  And we didn't have a...  It wasn't a cool camp with, like, canoeing and archery and things you see at, like, cool camps. 
[00:06:30]  It was pretty much...  You either played softball or, like, soccer or kickball outside.  But when it rained, they took you inside where you made, like, ashtrays out of clay.  Yeah.  And that was it.  Nothing fun about it.  That's retard camp.  It really was.  My mother just sent us there because she wanted to, like, have fun a summer.  And she didn't want the kids around.  What do you mean by have fun?  Probably have sex with multiple partners. 
[00:07:00]  I have no idea.  I don't know what she was into back then.  She was being groovy in her culottes.  I don't know.  It was...  Yeah.  So she just, you know, sent us all off to day camp.  What was that?  It sucked.  I did a little of that day camping, too.  Yeah.  Camp Alvernia, I think it was called.  I don't know.  The one on the lake?  Down by the lake?  Well, on the harbor there. 
[00:07:30]  Instead of port.  I think it was Moose Lake.  It's closer, so I made that assumption.  Yeah.  The one that's right by the lake there with the...  Because that's one that they...  Like, it's a camp for nannies, I think.  Or pairs.  I don't know.  This is going right back.  It's right by Centiport.  I used to take my jet ski by there, and they would all lay out topless, because that's  what they did in Europe, and they were all from, like, Sweden and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  So they'd lay out there, and you saw nothing but, like, these puttering jet skis doing circles. 
[00:08:00]  Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr.  And I was one of them.  Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr.  Thing could do, like, 60 miles an hour on the water, and I'm just doing...  Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, a mile and a half.  In front of this place.  Of course you got to.  Of course you have to.  This place is legendary.  Remember, back in the day, when we were working at NEW, Ben discovered that the Park Meridian,  the roof pool...  Ah, the rooftop pool!  Because a lot of Europeans stay there, they would sunbathe in the nude, basically. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  With maybe a tiny, tiny little thing down here.  But they were definitely topless, and we would go there and just eat lunch.  And watch babes sunbathe.  They just don't realize.  They like...  They think they're in Europe.  Where no one cares or pays attention.  To them, they were wearing bathing suits.  To us, it was a holy-ass moment.  Yeah.  Every afternoon when it was sunny out here in New York City, we'd...  Instead of show prepping, because, you know, people think that we used to show prep.  We never...  No.  For the most part, we've never show prepped.  That's crazy. 
[00:09:00]  We would spend an hour up there just having lunch.  And for some reason, they never kicked us out, which was kind of cool.  Yeah, nice.  We'd pull up a table with our dumb sandwiches and watch, you know, European babes sunbathing,  topless.  It was awesome.  It is fun when they're kind of out of place.  I tried doing that a couple years ago, going back up there because of 9-11.  9-11, now you can't get up to the roof without the key and this, and then it's all sorts  of security things going on.  Permits to get up there. 
[00:09:30]  I don't know what the hell the deal is.  So they took my topless boobies away from me.  Stupid 9-11 messing up my topless boobie thing.  I went to camp when I was a boy.  My mother sent me to camp when I was 13.  I didn't want to go.  And I remember we were such dorks that one of the guys thought it'd be cool if we all  pretended we were dead when the counselor came in.  So we all laid out like we were dead.  What was wrong with you?  I don't know.  What am I?  Yeah, I just played along.  You just did not have a normal childhood, Jimmy.  You guys were playing dead because you heard the rumors of this guy touching kids probably, 
[00:10:00]  and that was the only way you could think of it.  Play dead?  Yeah, play dead so he didn't violate you.  No, he was young.  He was like 16 or 17.  He was a young dude.  He was like one of those guys up in the summer trend.  And how old were you?  13.  Not perfect.  Summer creep.  Perfect for the hormones that are raging through your body.  But you, what, did he come in and wake you up every morning?  No, but I forget what he walked in and we all just pretended we were dead.  Like, what? 
[00:10:30]  Did it work?  No.  Of course it didn't.  We should have been.  Oh, watch out.  These guys are nuts.  Did you put ketchup around your neck or something?  I don't think someone did do that.  Not on my neck, but yeah.  Oh, no.  We were posing hacks.  What did he do?  Just dip his lunch into the kid's neck?  No, the worst.  For a little extra ketchup?  The worst out was when he walked in and he heard the, eh, of the screen door and he  looked around and then just, eh, and he walked out.  It was nothing.  No.  And you thought it was going to be so cool and he went, oh my God, they're dead.  There was just nothing.  By nothingness. 
[00:11:00]  No, the dorks had to just get up and go, all right, well, it had no impact.  So Kid Nation ended with kids just crying and saying goodbye forever, and they all know.  They're like, we'll never see each other again.  They'll have a reunion show or something, hopefully.  Well, I was kind of hoping for the reunion show.  You know, when these reality shows end, it's followed by the reunion show.  Not last night.  No reunion show for this Kid Nation.  No?  I want to see what these kids are about.  They're all like, well, that was done about 15 years ago.  Right.  Yeah, they'll have their reunion show. 
[00:11:30]  Let's have them be on the dope.  The other ones will be on the pole.  And then, you know, of course, they'll have to show you the kids that died.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Because it's the real world.  Yeah.  That's what's going to happen.  They'll follow these kids for the next five or six years.  This kid got arrested for drugs.  This kid is doing this.  This kid is dead.  This kid's pregnant.  Yeah.  They're going to spoil the innocence that was Kid Nation.  Aw.  Let's say hi to Scott on Long Island. 
[00:12:00]  What's up, Scott?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey.  Hey.  I went to that Paul Bunyan death camp myself.  Oh, you did?  I did.  And it was no picnic.  And Anthony, don't you BS.  You know it was no picnic.  Well, I know.  What do you have to add to this?  The instructors, they throw you in a pool, whether you knew how to swim or not.  If you didn't, you know, if you didn't get to the front and back, you know, you wouldn't 
[00:12:30]  get no lunch.  They throw you in the woods and they take off and leave you in there for hours.  Hey, yeah.  That happened to me.  Oh, yeah.  It happened to everybody.  It really was terrible.  I got tied to a tree.  And then this big, fat counselor took his big, meaty paw and smacked my stomach until  he gave me pink belly, where you just go, bam, bam, bam, and then left me tied to the  tree.  That's what you remember from that incident. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  You blocked out everything else.  I hope so.  You blocked it out.  I hope it stays repressed forever.  Wait, why did you add?  Because they were all a bunch of, I've used the, you know, used the scum word, and that's  what they were.  They were just a bunch of lowlives that were put in charge of these kids at the day camp.  Well, who else is going to do that job in the summer?  I know.  Like, cool kids were, like, lifeguarding and caddying and doing all that other stuff  that was kind of cool.  It was a crap day camp that had the worst counselors ever. 
[00:13:30]  I remember that guy.  He was, like, I think he was Russian or something, and he had this big, like, meaty wrestler  hand, big, fat mitt, and he just, like, smashed me in the stomach as I was tied to a tree.  He tied me to a tree.  Did he tell your mother?  Yeah.  What'd she do?  She didn't care.  She had a date.  She was wild back then. 
[00:14:00]  Wild, I tell you.  Probably with him.  She probably paid him to do that to you.  All right.  Thank you, Scott.  All right.  Sorry to bring up some bad memories.  Oh, yeah.  Thanks.  It's all good.  Paul Bunyan death camp.  They held it to Paul Bunyan death camp.  Yeah, let's see.  We arrived in boxcars.  Let's say good afternoon to Cleveland.  What's up, Ray?  How you doing, boys?  Hey, ma'am.  Hello, Jimmy.  How you doing?  Can't wait to see you on the 29th of February.  Thank you, Ray.  Wanted to call you for, of course, it's Anthony's favorite day of the week. 
[00:14:30]  Mm.  Day before Friday?  Oh, no.  Phone call Thursday.  We really did try to get rid of phone call Thursday, but the listeners will not allow it.  You know why?  It's the easiest way for them to contribute without having any creativity whatsoever.  Yeah.  So they come to the phone in droves to just say, happy phone call Thursday, because they  got nothing.  Anything else there, Ray?  Yeah.  Also, I used to go to a day camp out here in a suburb of Cleveland. 
[00:15:00]  And it was the worst camp I've ever been to in my entire life.  The counselors had no control of the kids.  They thought they did, but they never did.  You had counselors picking on kids, putting them down, all that stuff.  So I really relate to what Anthony's saying about, like, camps and stuff.  I think we all pretty much went to a camp growing up.  Oh, yeah.  And why did you...  You didn't need to control the kids.  Let them be.  Let them be wild.  It's camp.  Camp, huh? 
[00:15:30]  I used to fight all the time with kids.  It was amazing.  Yeah, there were a lot of fights.  There were...  You know, there was a bunch of kids being bussed from Central Islip to this Paul Bunyan  day camp.  So there was a lot of trouble.  A lot of racial trouble back then.  Even when you were, like, 12?  Dude, it was Central Islip.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And we'd be on the bus, and it was just like, the black kids controlled the bus.  At 12 years old?  Yeah.  Little skinny white kids.  We were just sitting there like, oh, boy. 
[00:16:00]  Don't mouth off.  Don't mouth off.  Oh, why did I get smacked in the face?  I didn't say a word.  I didn't even eyeball them.  You would get smacked?  Yeah.  Occasionally, you'd just...  Just as one guy was walking by, you'd get smacked in the face, and they'd all laugh  and go, ah!  As they walked...  Sorry.  As they walked to the back of the bus, oddly enough, you know, they had the freedom to  sit wherever they want, but wanted to sit in the back so they could pull shenanigans  on the poor little white children of Central Islip.  You slapped in the face?  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  I guess that's a lot of slapping stories in your childhood.  And just walked by.  I was constantly being slapped and crying.  That was my whole childhood.  Poor Anthony.  Poor me.  Thank you, Jimmy.  That thing was basically a punching bag.  I was so just abused.  It does explain a lot, though.  The mental abuse.  And then, like...  We're finally seeing where the seed was planted now, Jimmy.  And I have so many, like, regrets that I remember in my head.  Like, moments that probably could have been happy moments that I just didn't do the right 
[00:17:00]  thing or something.  There was...  I was in Central Islip, and it was a lot...  Just a lot of racial trouble.  I guess it was, you know, during the early 70s, and, you know, the races weren't getting  along very well back then.  And blacks were coming out onto the, you know, this new sense of empowerment.  And it was time to get back at Whitey.  Yep.  So, you know, us white kids kind of had to stick together and everything, but we never 
[00:17:30]  did.  We never could.  And then, I remember one time there was a little white girl named...  Her name was Dawn.  It kind of grossed me out a little, because that's my sister's name.  There's nothing worse than, like, being in love or lust with a girl that's the same  name as your sister.  I've said just the opposite.  I've said...  In Jimmy's case, it allows him to just relive the fond memories.  Nothing better.  And I would just...  I was telling people how I really liked this girl. 
[00:18:00]  And I guess the word got back to her.  And I was sitting at my desk, and we had this thing where we all had to make these little...  Kind of like a scenery, a little scenery thing of Thanksgiving or something.  So, I made little pilgrims and everything and set them up and glued them to some construction  paper and did a whole nice thing.  And then they brought in other classes to kind of look around at our thing.  So, I'm sitting at my desk all proud of my thing. 
[00:18:30]  And this girl, Dawn, comes by, and she looks at me, and she must have gotten word that I  liked her, because she looked at my stupid little construction paper thing and then looked  up at me and gave me this smile.  And I swear, I had to be probably nine years old at the time, but the smile she gave me,  I still remember.  It was one of the...  It sent, like, chills down my spine.  And I was like, oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:19:00]  And she kind of, like, looked at me a little more when she walked away to the next person's  stupid display.  That was probably a friggin' bodega or a crack dealer.  So, I was sitting there thinking, this is great, and I'm going to talk to her.  Dude, I never mustered up the balls to say a word to her.  And then it was just, you know, she goes along her merry way.  I had that one moment of a smile.  And I was like, hey, it's 80,000 years later, and I'm still regretting not talking to this 
[00:19:30]  girl at nine years old.  Where's she at now?  Ah, probably dating one of the black guys.  Absolutely.  Well, she's probably dating a pilgrim.  That had such an impact on her.  I turned her off to white kids.  Yeah, no go-get-em-gumption idiot that I was.  But that might have changed your life.  See, the good thing was, if you would have talked to her, you might have dated her and then  had self-worth, and you never would have been funny.  You wouldn't have needed to be funny.  That might have changed the course of your life. 
[00:20:00]  You might be right.  That little dumb kid might have wrecked her.  You might be right.  And you would have had five kids by now, too.  It could have been.  It could have changed.  You know, that is odd that there's that little, that might have been one of those forks in  the road in your life.  And another situation happened in California, and I talked about this one a while back.  Like, when I was in school, and this girl, very cute girl, was at her locker, and she's  bent down getting her stuff, and some douche just kicked the locker door and hit her square 
[00:20:30]  in the head, and she started crying.  And I was like three lockers away.  And all I wanted to do was go over there and comfort this crying girl that got her head  smashed by the locker.  And again, just what a pussy, I couldn't muster up the confidence that a girl that just got  her head smashed, that if I gave her a little comfort, she wouldn't just reject me.  So I'm sitting there, and I, should I, should I, should I, moment over, moment over, idiot. 
[00:21:00]  Just shut your locker, go to class, and regret it for 50,000 years.  Are you having a nervous breakdown?  No.  No, this is the stuff that keeps you from having a nervous breakdown.  You just vent it all out.  It's just memories of your childhood that, like, don't go away.  And for some reason, it's odd that they stay with you so vividly for so long.  But those are the things that made, here's the thing.  It makes you who you are.  It makes you who you are, because now the way to get the girl is make her laugh, is do 
[00:21:30]  this.  So that stuff kind of goes into making, that stupid, that big-headed chick in the locker  who probably deserved it, and the one who would have hated you after two dates anyway.  Not talking to them did change the question.  That made you who you are.  You never would have been as funny as you are if you had that kind of self-esteem.  There would have been no need for you to be funny.  I guess so.  The girls liked you because you had cute hair?  You would have just relied on your stupid hairdo.  Just let him vent, though, man.  Of course not let him vent, but I mean, I relate to him.  He's finally venting, getting this out. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  Getting all this crap out.  It's just...  And had an awful childhood, let's be honest.  There's so many stories like that.  But I just...  Sorry to ask mom, but...  But I wanted to have a really good, fun childhood, so I did, like, with myself and a few friends  and stuff.  Like, I think of a lot of times that I enjoyed.  I had a lot of fun growing up as a kid.  Did you ever enjoy your dad?  But they were punctuated by...  Yeah, I enjoyed my dad a lot, but with this reservation, with this impending doom feeling. 
[00:22:30]  Because it was just like, being around him was a lot of fun, but there was always this  element of danger.  Like, I always felt like I could be killed at any moment.  Either killed in a horrific drunken wreck, or shot accidentally, or starved to death, or  thrown from a horse.  There was always just this element of danger that he felt, in order to make me the guy  he wanted me to be, he had to put me through this training course that put me on the brink 
[00:23:00]  of death many times.  So it was kind of odd.  But I definitely enjoyed it.  12 through 16, around those years.  I was thinking of your dad when you were talking about that Thanksgiving display.  Mm-hmm.  How long did that last when you brought it home?  Oh, who knows?  He was probably having sex with his gomar up in Connecticut.  What a matter.  Jesus.  What's the matter, Joey?  Because he used to fill vending machines. 
[00:23:30]  That was his job.  Sure.  It's like, where were you?  Oh, Connecticut.  I don't remember your roots being up in Connecticut.  I had to pick some stuff up.  Oh, did you?  Why did it take two days?  Joey, don't think I'm stupid, Joey.  I know what's going on.  Shut up, bro.  Oh, I got a stomach ache.  Could you stop and tend to my tummy?  No, we can't.  Dad's having sex in Connecticut, and mom's pissed.  You'd fake injuries to get love and stop the fire. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, it was always a stomach ache.  I never had a new one.  I never had a new good one.  It was always, I got a stomach ache.  No, you don't.  That's the worst thing to tell a father, by the way, that you have a stomach ache.  I have a stomach ache.  You can tell your mom you got a stomach ache, but your father doesn't want to hear you got  that lame stomach ache thing.  It's a stomach ache.  Because men don't get stomach aches.  It was a tummy ache, and he would turn around and go, you don't have a stomach ache, and you  wish you could just project yourself as an adult into that kid to go, yeah, you're right. 
[00:24:30]  I don't.  I said I have a stomach ache because you two are ruining me.  You're just yelling.  It doesn't end.  It doesn't stop.  Could you just leave each other so we can grow up in an environment not filled with hate?  There.  My stomach's fine.  Put the Pepto away, mom.  The stomach's fine.  You two are jackasses, and you're destroying your children. 
[00:25:00]  That was 30-some-odd years ago.  You really should get over it.  Was it?  You really should just get over it.  Well, I have a question.  Wow.  I want to ask.  It seemed like yesterday when I was saying it.  No kidding.  Now, you saw this girl.  After she smiled at you, did you see her in the hallway all the time and just be afraid  to walk up to her?  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't even make eye contact after that.  Well, that's normal crap, though.  Dude, it might be normal crap, but everybody's an individual, so to me, it was like.  It's not normal.  And then there was, what was her name? 
[00:25:30]  Oh, my God.  Diane, I think, or Denise or something.  And she was in the apartment complex that I lived in in Central Islip.  And we went down in the basement and kissed in the basement.  Yeah.  And I was like, wow, that's pretty cool, you know?  First time I ever did that with a girl, with a little girl.  And then she takes off, and then I see her with this kid named Keith doing the same thing.  Yeah, that's just normal crap. 
[00:26:00]  You little slut.  But it adds up.  Yeah, but it's normal crap to be scared to talk to a girl when you're growing up.  I used to follow this girl home from when I was in junior high.  I had a massive crush on this girl.  I don't want to say her name.  I would follow her home.  I would keep my distance.  And it wasn't like I was stalking her because a lot of people walked home.  I want to know her name.  No way.  Why?  It's her first name only, of course.  But what's her name?  No, it's all right.  It's not Frank, is it?  No, it's not Frank.  And I was never brave enough to walk completely up to her. 
[00:26:30]  I would keep my distance.  And the whole time, I'm like, come on, you could do it.  I would have these conversations with myself.  You could do it.  And I would start walking a little faster.  I'd get a little closer.  Still pretty far away.  Still a couple hundred feet away.  And then I'd back off and have almost like a panic attack.  And I never told this girl how much I liked her.  Yeah.  Never did it.  But I followed her home for a long time.  See, you remember those things.  Oh, yeah.  And like Jimmy said, they all add up to make you the person you are. 
[00:27:00]  But all that's normal crap.  We could do an hour on this.  Yeah, but I was constantly doing it.  It was a part of my personality that I couldn't make the move.  I had no confidence as a kid to interact with girls in that way.  You didn't want to confront anything because of your parents.  Well, maybe, but I just didn't have any confidence.  And I think that was from growing up in like that household environment. 
[00:27:30]  It was probably not the most conducive to building a child's confidence.  All right.  We have to take our first break.  No, we can't.  I'm in the middle of a crisis.  I want to hear more of this when we get back.  Oh, absolutely.  Jimmy, yeah.  Very interesting stuff.  Anthony is finally venting and will continue to discuss.  I've vented about my stupid childhood for years.  Nah, it's a little different.  Oh, God.  You're like a 13-year-old kid today.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're having a nervous breakdown.  If I was like a 13-year-old kid, I'd be in the bathroom doing what 13-year-old kids do. 
[00:28:00]  By the way, if you're going to have a nervous breakdown, make sure it's around 730.  730?  That's when we have our biggest audience.  All right.  All right.  You will let us know if that lamb takes a look at your little display, won't you?  It's Opie and Anthony.  Good morning.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:28:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Battlefront  Battlefront  Battlefront  Battlefront  Battlefront  Battiness  Infigrating me  All I see  All I see  All I see  All that die  Tell my step  Find my holdings  Never get it 
[00:29:00]  Ah, Ah, Ah  Ah, Ah, Ah  Ah, Ah  Ah, Ah  Dad line  That's提ает my sight  Today's place  This has taken on a life of its own, hasn't it?  You could throw...  How good is it that you could throw retarded Steve in there and it still rocks? 
[00:29:30]  Oh, man, it rocks even more now.  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  We got Kelly from Michigan.  She wants in on this discussion.  I don't know, Kelly.  The Kelly Leak wasn't.  Kelly.  Good morning, guys.  Yes, it's a she.  She's a broad.  Hi, Kelly.  Hi.  What's up?  Hey, you know what?  I thought this was the Dr. Phil show.  The Dr. Phil show?  Yeah. 
[00:30:00]  Did I tune into the wrong station?  Well, it's venting a little bit.  Possibly getting close to a nervous breakdown, I'm thinking.  I don't think so.  I'm just kind of remembering and venting.  And not even like memories coming out of nowhere.  This is stuff I've remembered my whole life.  I look back fondly on a lot of it.  It's nostalgic.  It's very Wonder Years-ish.  But, you know.  I'm not sure how it still affects you.  You still get that feeling.  You'll think about that girl looking at the thing, and that smile still means something. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, it was so sweet and nice.  I was thinking about, you know, the girl I would follow home during the break.  And as soon as we went to commercial, I told Jimmy the name.  And then I realized, why didn't I just say the name on the radio?  Her name's, well, I'm still scared of saying it.  Well, no.  Her first name's Ann.  Because I think it brings you right back.  Like, oh my gosh, you might be listening.  Oh, jeez. 
[00:31:00]  I could give a crap.  I got a call.  I could give a crap about this girl I used to follow home.  But it brought me right back because Anthony had reminded me of something.  And I was scared to say her name because I'm thinking she might be listening to the show.  And I don't want to know what she really thinks of me.  Oh.  It was 20 some odd years ago or whatever it was.  Just want to keep that in that time capsule where whatever it was.  Right.  How old were you when you followed home?  Like junior high.  Oh, you're older than like seven, right?  Okay.  You're like.  Oh, no.  I was like 13.  You followed her home last week.  Yeah, last week.  Right. 
[00:31:30]  I follow her kids home now.  All right, Kelly.  Thank you.  You can have.  Yeah, it is time to get over it.  Oh, I'm.  You know something.  The truth of the matter is I'm really over a lot of stuff.  It's just there are kids that went through a hell of a lot worse than I did.  These are just these are just childhood moments.  Like Ope said, a lot of kids go through the same things, but it affects you and kind of  not so much now. 
[00:32:00]  You're not sitting there now still freaking out over anything, but it kind of made you  who you were.  You kind of bounced off of these events when you were growing up and all through your life  you bounce off these events and it kind of guides you down whatever path you end up  at the end of.  And, you know, those little moments are one thing.  And it was directly because I didn't have any confidence to go out and really, you know,  assert myself and say, hey, I'm sorry that idiot hit your head on the locker. 
[00:32:30]  You know, let me let me let me rub the bump on your head.  You could rub the bump in my.  If it's any consolation, hold on to it.  The guys that would have walked up to her and comforted her or smiled back and went,  oh, I'm glad you like my little project.  And there are plenty of kids like that.  None of them are funny.  Yeah.  Almost none of them could make anybody laugh.  It's a total lack of confidence that you just have to start making stupid jokes. 
[00:33:00]  It is a desperate reach for love.  It's a plea for attention.  Of course it is.  It's like, this is what I have to give you here, here.  But you know what?  35 years later or whatever, it's better to have that than a stupid high school football  jacket, which you would have gotten.  Who cares?  Fucking over the glory days.  I ran for 65 against Central.  Bunch of douches.  So good for you not to say hi to her.  I'm going to tell you who you are.  Central! 
[00:33:30]  Jimmy puts things in such great perspective.  Remember the big win over Central!  Look, man, it's weird.  It's like, when I think of the girl that I liked when I was a kid, I still have a feeling  for her, but I don't picture her as an adult.  I picture her as a third, fourth, and fifth grader.  Like, I had that little pic image of her in the school picture, and that's how you think.  So yeah, it's still very affecting.  Yeah.  There was a girl that I really had a huge crush on growing up, and I did try, and she  wouldn't give me the time of day. 
[00:34:00]  And then you fast forward many, many years, and I'm at a high school reunion, and this  girl is completely following me around the entire time.  Loving my ass.  Loving my ass.  That's because of who I am now.  Oh.  And I was like, you know what?  She wants the Hugh's fortune.  I'm like, you know what?  Go F yourself.  And I...  Yeah, reunion.  Go F yourself.  How old were you when you liked her? 
[00:34:30]  Honestly, from kindergarten all the way from most of high school.  Oh, okay.  I would keep going back to this one girl, like, wow, man.  And we, you know, when we were in kindergarten and the grammar school, we would talk.  We'd go to each other's house.  You know, nothing big.  No kisses.  None of that.  Never got to that.  But always had something for her.  And man, when I went to this high school reunion a few years back, wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  And I'm like, get lost. 
[00:35:00]  You don't think I see this coming?  Do you know that it's how it affects you?  I was kind of in love with this girl when I was in fourth and fifth grade, whatever.  And now I look back on it, and I realize that she didn't like me as much as I liked her.  And I remember going to her house one time, and we were going to hang out.  And then her and my friend kept going down to the basement, and they're like, just wait up here.  So I was like, okay.  And I waited up there.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Oh, God. 
[00:35:30]  Years later in high school, he told me, like, yeah, that day she and I were downstairs making out.  And I got, this is, you know, it was years later.  I got so angry.  I didn't tell him I got angry.  I knew that made me a kook.  But I was, like, so angry.  And it's like, I don't trust women.  And that's probably why.  You were just.  The one girl I really liked, all of a sudden.  I never want to be the guy that doesn't know.  Right.  Like, the guy that's like, oh, my God.  I thought.  I never want to be the guy that has the revelation and realizes he's been made a fool of all this.  Right, right.  I look back, and that day.  God, you were innocent, Jimmy.  And she's downstairs basically losing her virginity. 
[00:36:00]  Or what would be your virginity at that age.  Oof.  Like, stupid, non-kissable chapped lips.  So that's not crazy stuff.  No.  It really isn't.  There's one more of these horrid little stories of no confidence or anything and not being  able to see my hand in front of my face.  Before I left to go to California, I'd been living in Huntington, right behind Fred's Diner  over there.  Ope knows where that is.  And there was this girl, Leanne. 
[00:36:30]  Me and Leanne were buddies from the time I moved in there as a kid growing up into, like,  you know, pre-teen-dom, kind of junior high-ish age around there.  And before I went to California, I was like, all right, take it easy and stuff.  We'd always hung out, and I was really just in love with this girl.  Um, and then I went to California, and I get a letter from her, and it's just her writing,  I can't believe you left, uh, I'm so in love with you, and she was circling where her tears 
[00:37:00]  were hitting the page as she was writing.  And I'm like, I'm an idiot.  I'm 3,000 miles away now.  I'd have, like, you know, I'd have stayed in New York, probably, if it was, uh, uh, if  I knew how this girl felt.  And we hung out, like, every day.  Well, did you like her like that?  Yes!  But I, we hung out all the time, but I was just in an inept, complete lack of confidence 
[00:37:30]  douche who couldn't see, like, what was going on.  I thought we were friends, and I never wanted to make that next step because I, I didn't  want the rejection, or I just, uh, didn't have the courage to do it.  It's just, you know, an ass.  How old were you and showed you that letter?  Uh, 30?  No, no.  It's always funny to say you're older.  I know.  It makes you seem silly.  I love exaggerated humor. 
[00:38:00]  Probably 12 or something like that.  When's the next time you saw her after that?  Oh, man, when I came back from California, and then forget it, you know, everybody's just  having their own good time and off on their own, own ways, and it was, you know, completely  over.  But my mother told me, she goes, uh, Leanne came to, because when I was on the phone with  my mother from California, and she goes, Leanne came to the door and asked where you  were, and I told her you were in California, because I, I told her I was going, but I guess  I didn't say the day or anything like that.  And then I left, and she goes, and she just started crying. 
[00:38:30]  I was like, oh, that's odd.  And then I got the letter.  My baby, she wrote me a letter.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Wait, did you ever see Leanne?  I have to know what happened to Leanne.  Yeah, I saw Leanne after that, because I had kind of came back from California, moved into  the same neighborhood, but I was at the same house.  Tell you the truth.  She still lived like across the street.  I moved into the same house after I came back from California, went to the same school, and  I come walking in, and there's a big difference between 12 and 16, so I came walking in, and 
[00:39:00]  people were kind of like, I think I know this guy, but I'm looking around going, I know  you, I know everything about this person, I know this, so I'm kind of walking around,  because I disappeared from the face of the earth for a few years, according to these  people, but they were different people, too, you know, they were all older, and yeah,  I kind of picked up with old friendships, but for the most part, just made new friends.  Leanne, I kind of talked to her and stuff, but she was in her own crowd.  She ended up being, like, very hot, so she hung out with the, you know, hot girls, and 
[00:39:30]  perished the thought.  I approached them.  I'd rather stand in the back hall in my army jacket, smoking pot with guys, wondering why  there are no girls around us.  Where's Leanne now?  I don't know.  You don't want to know.  I don't know.  Can I be honest with you?  Where's Leanne?  You don't want to know where these girls are now.  No, probably not.  I think it helps sometimes, though, to kind of not feel bad about it anymore, and you  look at them now, and you go, oh, yeah.  They're middle-aged women heading toward menopause. 
[00:40:00]  You really, let's be honest with each other.  We have these memories of what they used to look like and what they used to do for you.  I don't want to know where these broads are.  No, I'm saying that's good with regret, though.  If you have regret, if you look at them now, it's like, ah, how can I regret that?  Look at you.  You're a pig.  Look.  It's like, we got everyone fooled.  They think we're in our late 20s, early 30s, but let's be honest.  Oh, really?  Some of the girls we dated are heading toward menopause at this point.  It's right over the hill. 
[00:40:30]  It's right around the bend.  I got it.  There was this girl, I mentioned it recently on the show, when we talked about long-distance  relationships, and I just am convinced they just don't work whatsoever, because I had  one when I was going to Geneseo with this girl.  She lived in Utica, and we wrote letters all summer long, back and forth with each other.  I got a stack.  I just remember this.  A stack of letters from her, still tied up in a bow or something, at my mom's house.  I'm going to bring them in, and I'm going to read a letter or two. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, yeah.  Because now, knowing what I know, as she's writing these letters, she went back out with  her ex, who was the star football player for Central!  Central!  She was banging him all summer long while she's writing me these awesome, like, romantic letters.  So now, I got to bring these in and read them on the air.  Wait, did she circle other things on the paper?  Right.  Where he had left a little mark.  It's where he hit my back, and it fell on the paper. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, she played it perfectly.  She wrote nice things, she quoted lyrics from Hot Songs of the Day, and perfume on the letters,  all that stuff, and then I find out, like, you know, later on, that the whole time, she  was banging her ex, who was the quarterback of Central!  Central!  He was behind her, and her face was pressed into the paper so hard, it looked like the  Shroud of Turin.  Right, right.  She must really love me.  Speaking of not trusting women, because now I just assume, like, they're naked together, 
[00:42:00]  and I was the joke the whole time, where the guy's like, oh, here, write this, write this.  Like, they're writing the letters together, because I was so effing gullible, I guess.  I will bring them in and read them on the air.  Yeah.  That'll be fun.  Definitely.  That would be fun, knowing, you know, what I know and what the listeners know.  I'll make some chills.  I wish I would have saved, like, letters and things, but too embarrassing.  There was a girl that broke up with me that I wrote a letter to, and you don't realize 
[00:42:30]  to later how just, how completely impossible it would have been to get that girl back.  Like, it was just over, you know?  She had moved on, and you are just a distant memory.  But you think there's this chance if you write this nice, like, letter or something,  and it was just, ugh!  Just talking about how, you know...  Hoping she'll forget that you had sex with her best friend.  No, it was even like...  No, it wasn't anything like that. 
[00:43:00]  It was just like, you know, it was that...  It's that time when they just decide, you know, or you decide, eh, you're just gonna leave.  It's done.  You know, you're early teens, you're in school, it's those school relationship things, and  then they just find someone else, you know?  One day they'll walk down the hallway and go, ah, okay, I'll go out with him.  And then you're just left there, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, so you write your little letters,  but we're so made for each other.  Made for each other?  What?  At 14? 
[00:43:30]  I'm not even completely made yet.  Yeah, I'm not even cooked.  I'm made for each other.  Made?  I'm not made.  This thing still needs a few parts.  It still has some ingredients.  Right.  But you know what?  When you look at this low self-esteem and not talking to a girl, then you look back at  the times you talked to them and shouldn't have.  Like, my self-esteem being low was justified.  When I was in high school, I liked this girl, Michelle.  I loved her.  And I couldn't ask her out, but I finally had the courage.  I looked her up in the phone book.  Oh.  And I called her.  And I was like, ah, hey, it's Jimmy. 
[00:44:00]  And she's like, hi.  And I'm like, ah, you don't want to go out with me, do you?  Oh, there's some confidence.  She actually was kind of nice.  She's like, no, I don't think so.  But she wasn't hateful about it.  Yeah, well, you put her in a great position.  And I think I told you this.  I tried to be careful.  I was like, well, that's the way the ball crumbles.  Like, I tried to be funny.  Oh, by mixing them up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thinking she'd go, oh, wait, on the other hand, you're funny. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Plenty of just embarrassing, douchey moments.  My most self-esteem was telling me the truth.  All right.  Now that we got therapy out of the way, we're going to start the Opie and Anthony show after  the break.  That's true.  We're all in our periods.  Yeah.  Convention, like, waiting to exhale in a half a circle.  What is going on in the world today, we'll tell you after the break.  How's that?  Yes.  And on the way, we've got a brand new Grammy moment, an Opie and Anthony Grammy moment,  because the Grammy nominations were announced recently. 
[00:45:00]  But here's the one from yesterday one more time, because it's really good.  It's our own club, Soda Kenny, getting involved with the Grammy moments.  We'll be back.  I don't know.  Oh, it's that bad.  It's an Opie and Anthony Grammy Minute.  Song of the Year.  Before he cheats, Carrie Underwood.  And I took my key into the side with his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive.  Carved my name into his leather seats. 
[00:45:30]  I took a Louisville stronger to both headlights.  Slashed a hole in all four tires.  Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats.  Expand your Grammy knowledge base with Opie and Anthony.  What?  What?  What? 
[00:46:00]  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What? 
[00:46:30]  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  Oh, I didn't realize.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony show.  That's the great Drew Boogie.  We call him the great Drew Boogie now.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  What's going on in the world?  Well, right off the bat, we've got to say good morning to Tina Turner. 
[00:47:00]  First good night's sleep she's gotten in 35 years.  You think?  I don't know.  How much of a wallop could Ike have packed at 70-something?  How old was he?  I think Tina Turner was living in fear right up until she got the news then.  Ike Turner died at, what, 76?  I remember my Ike Turner history is this.  I was in a motel one time with a prostitute, and she's doing things to me.  And I had to turn the TV off because there's an Ike Turner interview on,  and I caught her as her head is moving, her eyes were to the left. 
[00:47:30]  She was watching the Ike Turner interview while she was earning her keep.  You should have given it to her and scents around.  You could suck at a jaw.  Yeah, why not?  And people are saying that he architected the old rock and roll for everybody.  But we don't know that because we know about him smacking Tina Turner around.  There was a song that he did back in the day that they said that was pretty much one of the first songs  that started rock and roll on its way. 
[00:48:00]  I don't know the name.  I don't have it in front of me, but maybe we have it in the system.  We can play it for everybody today.  Is it before Bo Diddley?  Because Bo Diddley got ripped off a lot by a lot of people.  This was before Bo, I'm thinking.  I was in the 50s.  Where's the Ike Turner story?  And, yeah, Jessica Alba is ruined.  Almost 50.  Jessica Alba is pregnant, we're learning today.  I saw that in the office reading through the papers just going,  well, here goes another one.  Yeah.  Here we go, back to Ike Turner.  They're saying he made one of the first rock and roll records back in 1951, 
[00:48:30]  a song called Rocket 88.  I know a lot about rock and roll.  E-Rock, are you searching?  I don't think I've ever heard Rocket 88.  What's the 88 thing I wonder?  Rocket 88.  I have no idea, but they said that after this song came out,  people started thinking about this rock and roll thing.  I know what 88 means.  What?  Well, it's used as a greeting to some people.  Is it? 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  I'm so lost.  You don't know about that?  Am I supposed to stay lost?  See, it's the, H is the eighth letter of the alphabet.  So a lot of white supremacists will say 88, meaning HH, Heil Hitler.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Maybe you weren't supposed to say that.  Why?  Because I think that was supposed to be top secret stuff.  It's a secret.  No, it's not secret.  People know that.  You can't keep a secret.  No, no.  People know that.  It's been on documentaries.  But they don't know it.  Now a lot more people know it today. 
[00:49:30]  It's been on those documentaries where they play a lot of that music by, like,  Screwdriver and stuff.  Screwdriver?  You ever hear them?  No.  Yeah.  You ever see American History X?  Yeah.  I didn't pay that close attention.  Right?  Where I wrote down, like, bands and stuff as the credits were going by.  When My Name is Earl's Brother is singing that nice little tune in the van.  So Ike is dead at 76.  What did he die of?  Anyone know? 
[00:50:00]  Don't know.  Doesn't really matter, right?  You ever hear River Deep Mountain High?  Teen Turner did that.  It was in the movie.  It's when she did it with Phil Spector.  I thought Celine did that.  River Deep Mountain High?  You're kidding, right?  Oh, yeah.  I know she did it.  But she did remake it.  She remaked it.  But she remaked it.  I'm almost 40.  She remaked it.  She remaked it.  But in the movie, it's great.  He heard the song and he knew it was so good.  He's like, damn.  Oh, Anna Mae, that's a good song.  And then he beat her and sexually assault her on the console.  Yeah, really?  This song caught her a beating. 
[00:50:30]  I think he realized that she didn't need him anymore.  Yep.  She did this with Phil Spector.  Oh, okay.  Right.  So I...  Another great guy.  Did she hook up with any guy that liked women?  Ike dead.  The Mets report, that's not out yet, right?  What time did that come out?  Oh, it comes out this afternoon?  Yeah.  We're going to find out who was on the roids?  Yeah.  They say that the report names a bunch of current ballplayers and ballplayers from the past.  But they don't say in what context. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, really?  Yes.  I'm thinking it's not going to be this big list of, you know, outing people for steroid  use.  I think it's going to be, all right, this guy said this about this guy, so you include  his name in there.  Yeah.  I don't know, though.  And everyone in the office is like, oh, I hope Jeter's on it.  I hope Jeter's on it.  What do you got there, Travis?  No, it's going to be pretty big.  It's going to have MVPs and All-Stars.  But are they going to say, this MVP, steroids?  That's what I need to know.  It's not going to be, like, an accusation. 
[00:51:30]  It's going to be more, like, linking someone to steroids.  Yeah.  Because you can't prove anything.  Yeah, this is going to be a big letdown.  It's still going to be damaging to their reputation.  I think it's going to be a letdown.  You know what I've noticed as far as this whole steroid baseball player thing goes?  As long as there is an inkling of an element of doubt, people are willing to just not care.  It's like you've got to have video of the guy shooting up steroids, or else people are  like, I don't care.  And I think even if you saw that, the normal fans still wouldn't care. 
[00:52:00]  I think it's just the commission, and they're the ones that have a problem.  But no one, like we've said in the past, who cares?  Keep the balls flying out.  I want to see him hitting cars in other parking lots around the ballpark.  I did my rant yesterday, which is, yeah, who gives a crap as long as they're hitting 600?  I love 600-foot homers.  Knock them out.  I love the fact they hit the ball so far you have to get a canoe to go find it.  I want to see him bring Chief Nakahoma out every time someone's up at bat. 
[00:52:30]  I don't know.  Nakahoma.  I'm not related, or I don't know a ball player.  I don't give a crap they get cancer because they're taking this crap.  As long as they hit those monstrous home runs, I'm happy at all.  As a matter of fact, when they do get the tumors, I hope they give that to the pitcher  and let them pitch the tumors in and let the ballplayers hit that out of the stadium.  Hit that mushy tumor.  It would sound like a wet beanbag getting hit. 
[00:53:00]  Walks splat.  It breaks up into five pieces.  The outfielders all catch a piece.  Yeah.  If you can find, E-Rock, if you can find...  Minutes high!  Minutes!  Minutes far and...  Well, that piece is.  If you can find some audio...  Is it a tuber?  It is!  If you can find some audio from the great Bill Hicks, I'd appreciate it.  He talks about this whole thing about drugs and stuff, and I think he does a bit on how...  Can you imagine if they took drugs out of music? 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  How awful that would be.  And it should be the same thing for sports.  Let them do whatever the hell they want.  I don't care.  None of my beeswax.  It's not affecting me personally.  I like to say.  But then they say, well, the children, the children.  Well, what about all the children that are picking up guitars and stuff?  Or drinking.  But players can drink alcohol.  Right.  You don't take steroids and do, you know, drunk driving to a family.  Yeah.  No.  Alcohol advertised in the...  You just choke them to death, apparently.  Oh, yeah.  Well, yeah.  Oh, that little goose.  Oops. 
[00:54:00]  But in general, you know, alcohol, they sell at the stadiums, and you can't even...  You can legally drink it, but you cannot get in your car after you have it.  So they should sell steroids.  Everybody be big and strong and walk home.  At least we sell.  Carry their cars.  At least with...  At least with steroids, it takes 20 years, so, you know.  Right.  It takes 20 years for something to happen to you.  Yeah, you got a little time.  Yeah.  You're all big.  So the Mitchell Report comes out today.  Hopefully, it'll be interesting.  Not worth reading.  Just somebody else will do the reading for us, I guess, and give us some bullet points, 
[00:54:30]  right?  Watch it be Mitch Mitchell's report.  The guy just comes out with something about Jimi Hendrix that's irrelevant, no one cared  about.  A Mitch Mitchell joke.  He did die of drug overdose, yes.  Yes.  Finally.  Well, what?  What else is going on?  Golden Globe nominations, who cares?  Kiefer Sutherland receiving over 100 letters in jail.  A day.  A day.  Yeah.  A day.  And they're all written by Travis.  Travis, did you send your letter?  No, but I think I'm gonna.  No, you wrote a letter to... 
[00:55:00]  No, I'm gonna.  Oh, you are so, so in love with this man.  My wife wants me to send the picture.  Oh, bring up your wife.  You had to, like...  My wife wants me to...  My wife, you know.  Remember, this is all like a bit that I'm in love with a man.  No.  Don't want to confuse anybody out there.  You're in love with Kiefer Sutherland.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Would you let Kiefer, if you were in a bathtub, would you let Kiefer sit on the edge of the  tub and gently just rub, like, scented lotions into your shoulders?  I like the idea.  Travis hunched over in the tub, and Kiefer's got one of those big sponges, and he rings 
[00:55:30]  it out so you hear the splashing of the water, and then he just rubs his back.  And Kiefer's nude on the edge of the tub, with a towel around his waist, with a towel  around his waist, and a tent in the front of the towel, and he sees your Fiona Apple-ish  form.  Oh, was that horrible?  What an awful image this conjures up.  Sounds like a good image.  No.  Jail.  What is it?  Has he served his time yet?  No, he's probably got, like, 40 days left. 
[00:56:00]  40?  You think that many?  Yeah, he just started this thing.  Yeah, but...  So, Travis, celebrities, they get out quick.  Write your letter, because he's getting 100 a day, and then you read it on the air before  you go to the post office.  I will do that tonight.  Oh, please, you rookie.  People are commenting, does Travis, has he seen the Christmas tree video?  Yes.  Oh, here's, does Travis imagine he's the Christmas tree Kiefer tackles in the video?  There's some great Kiefer solo videos.  Oh, some drunk Kiefer video is fantastic. 
[00:56:30]  Nothing wrong with that.  Well, they say he's a model prisoner, too, but what do you think?  He's been there, A, he's been there a week, and B, he's tight.  What, is he going to run the Aryans?  He's just a dummy with a great acting father.  You bring up a great point, the model prisoner crap.  Of course he is.  You're in prison.  Why would you risk what you got going for you on the outside?  Is Kiefer going to stir up a little static with the Latin Kings and the Crips in his seventh  day of jail?  I'm taking over, boys.  He's in protective custody.  He'd be the, what he's going to be is the perfect woman in jail. 
[00:57:00]  If he's anything, they'll pass him around.  The model invade, yeah.  The joint.  The model.  How funny would it be if he does go the other way and he's just an animal in prison?  Oh.  You mean, uh, size queen?  Kind of a...  No, just, whatever.  Just, I'm just thinking, just, yeah.  Oh, like, like, buffed up and kicking ass?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It comes out with...  Like he runs the joint?  It comes out with neck tattoos.  Teardrop tattoos.  Teardrop tattoo and TCB on his arm.  He killed someone in there.  What does TCB mean?  Take care of business. 
[00:57:30]  That's like what some of the guys in prison put on there if they've killed somebody.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I know a little bit about everything.  I try.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  I gotta get rid of my BTO tattoo.  Oh.  Bachman Turner Overdrive?  Yeah.  That doesn't mean anything.  That could be a problem.  Here's, uh, Kiefer Sutherland.  Hey, Kiefer.  You a pirate, man.  That would explain everything.  Come on.  That would explain everything.  And then he jumped into the Christmas tree, right? 
[00:58:00]  And tackled it and made out with it, whatever the hell he did.  Do you always have a photo with him?  Huh?  No, I have one, too.  Do you really?  You do?  Yeah.  Where did you see him?  Um, one of the days that you guys went to Philly, and I didn't go.  Oh, kismet.  He, uh, he was on JV and Elvis.  Oh, wow.  That's a pretty good get.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, it worked out.  Very cool.  That's cool.  Oh, yeah.  Do you have a picture with him?  Oh, yeah.  That's nice.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That was great.  Oh, yeah.  Travis's one leg raised. 
[00:58:30]  1940s side hug.  In other news, the Stupid Knicks lost to the Sonics, who are an awful,  uh, basketball team this year.  I mention this because, uh, at this point, you gotta think Isaiah Thomas is, is done.  Done.  Coach.  You gotta start thinking that.  He cost her $12 million and he's not winning games.  That's not good.  And Jimmy brought up a great point about the $12 million thing.  That, that, uh, woman that accused Isaiah Thomas of sexual harassment, she got $11.6 or whatever,  $12 million.  Oh, yeah.  And, uh, and there's another case in the paper and, and we're, I guess we're making some kind 
[00:59:00]  of comparison.  Well, there is a connection.  Just to show you, like, how stupid America, we really are just a completely inconsistent nation  of just dopes.  A jury awarded $2.5 million in damages Wednesday to a woman, and this is in Massachusetts, who  received HIV treatments for almost nine years before discovering she never actually had the  virus.  It's bittersweet news.  Yeah.  I mean, it's not like it's six months.  I mean, nine years to have acted like, I mean, that's a long hunk of your life.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:59:30]  And she gets $2.5 million.  This horse-faced woman from the garden, and she was a horse-faced woman.  Oh, yeah.  She had a long head.  Yes.  I want to sit on her back and go, yeah!  It's $11.5 million.  Yeah, where's the, that, that, that's nothing.  Why?  Because it was a high-profile case.  Holy Jesus, I didn't even realize that.  Yeah, we didn't see it.  The woman that thought she had AIDS for nine years doesn't get as much.  Imagine this woman turning into a slut because she had nothing to lose. 
[01:00:00]  Doesn't get as much as, as you couldn't take some ribbing at work woman.  Ugh.  Yep.  That's a justifiable amount of money.  I think 2.5, when for nine years doctors are treating you for HIV and you don't have it,  that's not, I mean, that's a long time.  Wow.  That is pretty, uh, pretty crazy.  And then, of course, we're three days away from the big game.  The big game.  The Jets and the Pats.  Oh.  A lot of attention.  Oh, I thought you couldn't say Super Bowl.  No.  F saying, not saying Super Bowl. 
[01:00:30]  I say it all the time.  Super Bowl, Super Bowl, Super Bowl, Super Bowl.  Yeah, it's silly.  The big game.  So if you're going to sit down with friends to the big game, watch it on a, all right,  we get it.  Super Bowl, because it's in an ad or something?  Yeah.  What a bunch of pompous asses.  You can't use it for any promotional thing.  Promotional thing?  You're promoting their big game.  You're promoting their stupid big game.  Anyway, uh, Super Bowl.  And as a Jets fan, I want to see the Jets lose by 50 points. 
[01:01:00]  Wow.  You should root for them to win.  You know how annoying the Patriots would be?  I don't want the Jets to beat the Pats.  Why?  I just don't.  Oh, boy.  I just don't.  Oh, no.  I just don't.  Oh, no, this is not good.  Call me a Fairweather fan.  No, I'm calling in the sports curse.  I told you a while ago I'm a free agent fan at this point, and this year I decided I like  the Pats better than, you know, the Jets, and that's just how it goes.  I want to see the Pats go undefeated.  I absolutely do.  Can I say the Jets, you have a right to be a discredited Jets fan. 
[01:01:30]  To me, they have been a disgrace for all these years the way they're, they don't have their  own stadium.  No.  They never, ever improve the team.  They have to cover up the Giants' logos when they have home games.  Yeah, it's sad.  It's pretty lame.  Is that they're the only team, right?  I would imagine.  They're a disgraceful organization.  People, their fans should stop going to the games until they get a stadium and start behaving  like a real team.  They have to share a stadium. 
[01:02:00]  It's annoying.  Why do?  It's so weird that, like, football teams get a brand new stadium for, you know, eight  games.  Eight days.  Eight days a year.  If you really think about it on very basic terms, that is a waste of money.  Wow.  Yeah.  I mean, and you can call up and go, well, yeah, but the Stones come every summer and  fill up the stadium, and you two does too.  But if you really think about a football stadium.  It's being built as a football stadium.  And how many days a year it's actually used, it's insane. 
[01:02:30]  And they throw the high school football teams a bone, and they do some high school football  and this and that.  But for the most part, it's eight days a year these stadiums are used.  How crazy is that?  Can't get it on a stadium.  A couple playoff games, obviously.  You know, you throw that in there, it's no more than ten.  That's something.  They're in another state.  You understand the Giants, too, but at least they have the Giants on it.  Don't tell anybody.  What?  They really should be called the New Jersey Jets.  Well, that's not New York's problem.  That's New Jersey's low self-esteem. 
[01:03:00]  You know that, yeah, New York has one official football team.  Buffalo.  Buffalo.  And Dallas, because they're America's team.  No.  F. Dallas.  Okay.  Hate the Cowboys.  I know.  Jets used to play at Shea.  Of course they did.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who are the Cowboys playing this weekend?  A team.  Who knows?  A team.  A team.  I would like to see the Cowboys pass Super Bowl.  Yeah, the Patriots would win. 
[01:03:30]  Who's going to beat the Patriots this year in the Super Bowl?  Nobody, I don't think.  I don't think so either.  Unless Brady pulls it.  I hope Brady goes to tie his shoes and both his Achilles roll up to his spine.  I hope he hears a snapper.  And they both go.  Because I want the Cowboys to win the Super Bowl.  And that's the only shot they have.  Is if he hurts his Achilles in the locker room.  Putting on his shoes?  Wow.  Guy's amazing, dude.  That's rough.  It would be funny that the Cowboys win the Super Bowl after Parcells is gone. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  I mean, look what the Patriots are doing without him.  Pretty well.  What are we talking about?  We're just like a football show now.  We're just babbling.  It's a sports show.  We're just babbling about sports.  Sorry to the listeners for that last five minutes.  It's all right.  I'm here and I'm bored.  On the way, we've got to talk about the boys, 11 and 14, charged with sexual assault on  a 60-year-old woman.  What were they thinking?  I don't know.  Raging hormones?  What is that about?  No.  We'll try to get some details on that.  And three main minorities.  This is a big story today.  Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians don't trust each other. 
[01:04:30]  Of course not.  Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians don't trust each other?  Of course not.  It's weird.  Why is it weird?  All looking over each other's shoulders.  We all look over each other's shoulders, our shoulders, whatever.  I'll tell you why they're amazed at it.  Where does Whitey fit into this?  A lot of them actually like white people more than they do the other minority groups.  Really?  Yeah.  And this is probably an interesting or surprising.  Where was this study done?  I don't know, actually.  I can't find mine.  I have it.  The Institute? 
[01:05:00]  The Institute.  They're saying it's so surprising, but probably because people just can't believe  that minority groups, people are so guilty about being white, they can't believe that  minority groups have any negative feelings for each other because they think white people  are at fault for everything.  Yeah.  They do wrong things, too.  So they just lump them into one category.  There's some great quotes here, by the way.  44% of Hispanics and 47% of Asians are afraid of African Americans because they're responsible  for most of the crime. 
[01:05:30]  More than half of black Americans polled and 46% of Hispanics said Asian business owners  do not treat them with respect.  And half of African Americans said Latin American immigrants are taking jobs, housing, and political  power away from the black community.  Wow.  Catch-22.  Yeah.  Hispanics and Asians' populations make mostly of immigrants.  They're positive about the American dream, saying if you work hard, you're going to reap  the rewards.  But in contrast, more than 60% of blacks dismissed the American dream as not working for them. 
[01:06:00]  They kind of came here under crappy circumstances.  Yeah.  And all three ethnic groups viewed white Americans in more favorable light than they did members  of another minority.  It's interesting.  Wow.  I thought we were like the most hated.  61% of Hispanics.  Wonderful.  54% of Asians and 47% of African Americans said they would rather do business with whites  than members of the other two groups. 
[01:06:30]  So.  Hmm.  Well.  That's out and about today as well.  I think that could also be because of financial reasons.  You know.  Yeah, the Jews kind of fall into white.  Can I trust them?  Pay the bills.  Things like that.  I didn't curse the Pats, by the way, there, John in Connecticut.  My sports curse has...  People are getting a little nervous.  My sports curse has gone away.  It was broken.  Yeah.  I believe it has been broken.  I would love to keep that storyline going.  For now.  But I think it's broken for now.  Jeff by six.  And by the way, F the stupid Sabres. 
[01:07:00]  Thank you.  What is that?  Are you a dope?  He didn't do it.  Are we still on?  Eric, you don't have to put your hands up.  You can just say it's not me.  Do they all run off?  I'm excusing you of touching someone.  Are we on off?  Where are we?  We're still live?  Yeah.  Who hit that button?  Are we on everywhere?  Oh.  How are your eyes?  Eyes are fine.  We can't hear you, Eric.  He's just talking to us. 
[01:07:30]  He has a Wi-Fi microphone.  The whole country can hear him.  When we talk to you, we're talking to a big audience.  I'm glad we're all back to normal today.  Because yesterday we had to handle E-Rock with Kid Glove.  Yeah, because we almost killed him.  Because we almost killed him a couple days ago.  So now we're back to normal finally.  But the E-Rock video getting a lot of views on YouTube and other video sites.  I hear Break is not happy with us.  Break.com.  Right.  According to Steve, Steve says that Break.com invented the cinnamon challenge 
[01:08:00]  and copyrighted or what do they do?  Why don't they stop?  So they're a little mad at us that we actually A, did it  and B, promoted another video website.  Well, it was the one that we saw it on.  Well, they said they were responsible for that video too.  All right.  What are we supposed to do?  Know every video that goes on these sites?  Steve, what happened with our friends?  They're running rampant.  What happened with our friends at Break.com?  No, they're not upset with us.  I actually talked to them last night. 
[01:08:30]  I should be upset with you.  You corrected me.  Corrected?  Yeah, I was corrected.  All right.  What did they say?  They said, yeah, they heard the segment.  They said, to be honest, we were the ones that created the whole cinnamon challenge thing.  All right.  So they'll be sued when someone dies from doing this.  Great.  Yeah.  I wouldn't fess up to that.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know if they own the rights to the name, but they own the rights to a lot  of the videos that are out there.  And so when I presented the E-Rock thing, they're like, yeah, that's cool.  But we're into the hot chicks getting the cinnamon challenge now.  That apparently guys having cinnamon challenge.  And this is all news to me. 
[01:09:00]  But guys doing cinnamon challenge is all passe now.  It's all about hot chicks doing cinnamon challenge now.  It's not passe to the masses.  It's passe maybe.  And when you almost kill somebody.  Right.  Our video is better than anyone I've seen out there.  It is very good.  And it's labeled best cinnamon challenge ever.  Yep.  It's labeled that for a reason.  E-Rock Chokes on Opie and Anthony.  You can check it out for yourself on YouTube.  Getting lots of views today.  I didn't know about the cinnamon challenge until it got brought up the other day.  Of course not.  I'd never heard of it.  I'm on the internet constantly. 
[01:09:30]  I've seen it on every single video site out there.  I've seen a variation of people putting spoonfuls of cinnamon in their mouth.  So do we hate break.com now?  No.  Not at all.  No.  Not at all.  They're not mad at us.  They just.  That was a joke.  Calm down, Steve.  Jesus.  Sorry.  Relax.  Ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne-ne.  I don't understand sometimes.  No, I know.  You're a little slow.  I know.  No one has done the cinnamon thing yet, huh?  What?  It can't be done.  No, supposedly people have done it.  Sure they have. 
[01:10:00]  I personally just want to.  It can't be done.  I want to go on record and say maybe you shouldn't try this at home because of what we witnessed  a couple days ago.  Never do it.  A couple days ago, it was pretty horrific what was going on in front of us.  You can check it out for yourself.  The video's up on YouTube.  And is it up on break now or not?  It is.  It is.  It's not featured, but I'm working on that.  Tell him to feature it.  Okay.  We give him enough plugs on this show to the point Tom thinks we're in cahoots with them.  Go to YouTube.  It's called what?  Best cinnamon challenge ever. 
[01:10:30]  Wait, you can't go to break?  You can.  It's up there.  It's right there.  Yeah, but YouTube's getting a lot of honors and stuff, which is fun for everybody.  Gotcha.  All right.  And as we go to break, we got another Grammy moment.  This one featuring Roland.  Listen to this.  It's an Opie and Anthony Grammy Minute.  Best male pop vocal performance.  Dance tonight, Paul McCartney.  Everybody's going to dance tonight.  Everybody's going to feel all right.  Everybody's going to dance around tonight. 
[01:11:00]  Expand your Grammy knowledge base with Opie and Anthony.  We'll be right back. 
[01:11:30]  Anthony show.  Hopefully at this point, we don't even have to explain what that's all about.  I don't think we do.  I'll tell you right now.  We can go to the phone zone.  People will go, what was that?  Even though we've been pushing these things for the last three or four weeks. 
[01:12:00]  That's true.  Some people are stupid, but for the most part.  It's just how radio works.  Phone number 877-212-0-&A.  Hey, someone's mad because I didn't promote Break there, but I did promote Break.com.  So relax.  Relax.  A lot of people are going to YouTube to check out E-Rock Choking on Cinnamon.  If you want to go to Break and check out E-Rock Choking on Cinnamon, that's fine.  Whatever.  We just know we have a really good video and people are definitely checking it out. 
[01:12:30]  And that's all that matters in the end.  Jimmy, you all right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Was it successful back in the back office?  We've got a really funny story.  I'm just going to read what we have here.  South Korean scientists have cloned cats by manipulating a fluorescent protein gene, a  procedure which could help develop treatments for human genetic diseases, officials said  Wednesday.  In a side effect, the cloned cats glow in the dark when exposed to ultraviolet beams. 
[01:13:00]  So South Korean scientists have cloned cats that glow in the dark.  Okay.  Any other stories you want to talk about?  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, that's it.  That's it.  So if revert.com.  Can I tear down a wall?  Basically what Jimmy's getting at, we could have done 20 minutes on that.  Yeah, yeah.  And Jimmy's now biting himself.  Ah!  He's spitting on the floor.  Oh, boy.  Americans are revolting.  Where we sit.  Where we sit. 
[01:13:30]  But we just want to acknowledge we could have done easily 15 or 20 minutes on that.  God, are we a fraudulent.  So instead, we'll just talk about the Golden Globes.  Why wouldn't we be able to talk about glow in the dark cats in where?  It says South Korean scientists.  I would not.  South Korean scientists.  I ripped up the paper.  Made glow in the dark cats.  Now, there are certain humorous little things we could throw in there about stereotypes. 
[01:14:00]  But, lest we offend, we must steer clear.  Even though what we want to actually turn into a comedy little bit, a funny comedy thing,  is actually true in certain parts of Korea.  It is fact. 
[01:14:30]  The thing I cannot even say is fact.  Don't worry.  South Park will say it.  Yes.  And they'll get away with it because they're cartoon characters.  I'm telling you, we've got to turn into cartoon characters.  Yep.  South Park would say it.  You know what would be great?  If American cattlemen could make a glow in the dark cow, that would be fantastic.  Maybe this technology can be brought here and we can have glow in the dark cows so that 
[01:15:00]  way we can all eat in the dark.  Imagine.  Your steak would just sit there and you'd be able to eat it in the dark because it would  be glowing.  That would be funny.  That would be.  Or all of a sudden you're out in the field and you see your dinner in the dark running  around in a circle.  It's so easy to catch.  Yeah.  You don't even need night vision goggles.  It's glowing.  Of course it is. 
[01:15:30]  You could just rope them right there at night.  A bunch of glowing cows.  How nice would that be?  Right here in Brainerd.  All right.  So that just turned into a news story.  That's fine.  That's what the news does.  We could just read news stories on the show.  Yeah.  This it's just again, Breabard is not a site that I love.  No.  I do think that the majority of it is, I mean, fairly news news newsy stuff.  I don't think it's like blogs, but I'm only reading it as it says, South Korean scientists 
[01:16:00]  have cloned cats by manipulating a fluorescent protein gene, a procedure which could help develop  treatment for human genetic diseases.  The ability to produce cloned cats with the manipulated genes is as significant as it could be used 
[01:16:30]  for developing treatment for genetic diseases and for reproducing model animals suffering  from the same diseases as humans.  We'll be right back. 
[01:17:00]  And guitarist Jimmy Page slapped each other on the back and were handed giant mugs of hot drinks.  But then the rock fighting talk began.  They discussed returning to Madison Square Garden in New York, where they did three sellout shows in 1973.  So whether or not Zeppelin will continue the tour to the U.S., I'm hoping they do. 
[01:17:30]  But that's what they're saying, you know, that they overheard him backstage.  Yeah, but talking about a New York show.  That sounds like such hype.  That sounds like something that was pre-planned.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it was quite a guest list at the Zeppelin show.  That must have been a heck of a show.  Although I will say that dumb Led Zeppelin, that really, the marketing idea behind it works, because I did go out and get a greatest hits. 
[01:18:00]  I've been craving Led Zeppelin lately after, because they're not on iTunes.  Guy forbid they should be.  Yeah.  You know, or it would be convenient to get them.  They're, I guess, still holding out.  So I went out and bought a Zeppelin greatest hits.  Ooh.  You're putting more money in their pocket books.  I was lining their, I'm lining their purse strings.  All right.  Well.  Are you kidding me?  We don't eat cows.  What?  We eat male cows. 
[01:18:30]  Okay.  We eat cows?  Tom in Jersey, what's up?  Now, a cow is a female.  We do not eat cows.  We eat steers.  Of course not.  Yes.  Well, we don't eat cow.  What are you talking about?  No, we don't eat cow.  Most cows, when cows are done producing milk and birthing calves, they go towards commercial grade seats, meaning making dog food, cat food.  Dog food?  You've got to watch your language.  Oh, hey.  But when they take a steer and they want to make little baby steers, what do they mate the steer with? 
[01:19:00]  Ah, he's gone.  He might still be there.  You there?  I'm here.  I'm here.  Oh.  So wait.  What do they mate the steer with when they want to make baby steers?  Cows.  Thank you.  That's all I care about.  It's a cow.  How about cow tongue, by the way?  What is that?  Yeah.  It's still a steer tongue.  Is it?  It's disgusting.  All right.  I didn't know that.  Nyeh. 
[01:19:30]  It's just sitting there in the meat counter.  Nyeh.  I love that.  I saw footage of a burned cow.  You know, it was like a burned cow.  It was a Mississippi burning.  It was a fire scene.  And at the end, the cows, they say, just stand there until their bellies explode because they're  so dumb.  And there's nothing funny than seeing a burned, stiff, dead cow with no lips.  Just big, dumb cow teeth.  Like, eh, how do you know?  And you close your pants down.  Like, you can almost see the cow shrugging.  Like, I don't know how to run. 
[01:20:00]  I just stand here.  It's stupid animals.  They are dumb.  They don't even have real horns.  It's just those two little fruity things you can hang, like, tinsel off of.  Let's go to Tony.  Tony, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  Oh, morning, guys.  Hey, you guys are kicking this morning.  Yeah.  Hey, if they're going to make something glow in the dark, they need to make the deer glow  in the dark so we stop hitting the damn things.  There you go.  Let's go to Drama Daddy. 
[01:20:30]  Drama Daddy, what's up?  Hey, I was just thinking, now that we have, you know, glow in the dark pussies, if they  could just make, you know, roosters glow in the dark, we'd have a glow in the dark cogs,  too.  Yeah.  That's true.  He didn't.  Did he?  Did he actually try to do the cat rooster joke?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, what do you expect?  All right.  Better from our audience than that.  What do I expect?  The sound of a self-inflicted gunshot at the end of that one.  That would be more of a, have a roly-poly Christmas type of joke. 
[01:21:00]  For the people who blinked along.  That's what we want to hear at the end of that bad joke.  Oh, anyone doing a rooster cat joke.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Looks like the moral of the story is, you know, never grab a pussy with a, you know,  a, we get it.  Right.  We understand.  Let's go to Chuck.  Chuck's next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up, Chuck?  I don't get it.  What's up, Chuck?  Throw-up joke. 
[01:21:30]  We still allow you to throw-up jokes.  What?  What?  Sorry to call you guys out on this one.  I got to correct you.  You guys keep saying steer.  Steer is a sterile bull, so steers don't have sex with anything and reproduce.  Yeah.  You've never seen me on a farm behind a steer.  Just taunting it.  What the hell is this?  The farm report?  We don't care.  Exactly.  When we say eat cows, we know what I'm talking about.  That's right.  All right.  Thank you, Chuck.  A big, juicy steak. 
[01:22:00]  That's right.  Go take your agricultural report and get hoofed in the mouth by an angry horse.  Take a nice, angry, stallion hoof right to your jaw.  All right.  Hey, speaking of Led Zeppelin.  Oh, are we?  Oh, that's right.  Just trying to find an excuse to replay this.  Kenny, in honor of Zeppelin doing their first show in 28 years, he did this the other day.  It's quick.  There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold, and she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
[01:22:30]  And when she gets there, she knows if the stores are all closed with a word, she can get what 
[01:23:00]  she came for.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.  Thank you.  You know what?  Kenny's my best friend today, though.  I know he sounds awful, but...  He carries a phone book a lot better than he carries a tune. 
[01:23:30]  Police beating joke.  Did you get your building tips together yet?  No, but I will.  Kenny did mine for me, thank you.  What?  Thank you very much.  You doing cash or checks?  Cold hard cash.  Oh, are you?  I can't do it in cash.  A bunch of people know that I finally moved into a real place.  That's about five or six months ago, four or five months ago, something like that.  There it is.  There is the reason.  Here's the reason why Kenny is my best friend today. 
[01:24:00]  All right, hold the phone.  What in the love of all that is holy do you tip that many people to do?  This is what you have to deal with if you live in a building in New York City.  And I know some of them...  It's extortion.  It's exactly that, Anthony.  And I know some of them listen to the show and they're fans of the show.  And there's some of the people that I like.  And they absolutely deserve a little something-something around the holidays, okay?  But you move into a building in New York City and you start hearing things. 
[01:24:30]  You hear a little chatter.  Chatter?  You hear a little chatter somewhere around July or August where they start hinting that, you know, around Christmas time, people are expecting a little something-something.  You have a stack there that...  I'll tell you how many.  There are 37.  There is no way.  37?  And I haven't even taken care of the garage people yet.  You tip 37 people?  37 people!  Including you? 
[01:25:00]  30 in a row?  37.  Come on.  Jimmy knows.  Jimmy knows.  So you hear this chatter like, you know, you've got to tip these people around the holidays, blah, blah, blah.  It's like kind of living like in a hotel.  Well, and sure enough, about right around Thanksgiving, all of a sudden, the happy holiday card comes with a whole involved pamphlet of everyone's picture, what they do.  I like that, though, because you know who's who.  Look, I can't imagine there's 37 people doing stuff that they deserve to be tipped. 
[01:25:30]  Who?  It is extortion.  What?  Okay, hold on.  That would make your life a living hell if you're the dope that doesn't tip everybody.  Here's all I could think of.  Here's all I could think of.  Where's the pal talk camera?  There you go.  The doorman.  Can they see this?  The doorman, right?  There's a bunch of doormans.  Okay.  There's like six.  Don't show me.  Okay, so there's six.  Six of them got to be tipped.  Sure.  Doorman.  Okay, I thought you give your doorman. 
[01:26:00]  The one that you see on a daily basis.  Concierge.  Concierge.  Behind the desk.  They have door.  It's a big building.  So they have a guy that works behind it.  It's not like some buildings have one guy that does both.  But this is a big.  There's a lot of people.  Concierge.  What do you call them?  Garbage removal.  Garbage.  Health club.  Maintenance guys.  Maintenance.  Electrical engineers.  Security guys.  Electrical engineers.  That bring up my takeout.  37 envelopes, my friend.  This is what you have to do.  And I lick them all. 
[01:26:30]  And Kenny licked them all.  He picks me up.  He goes, here's your gratuities, GH.  GH, 37 of them.  And I licked every envelope.  I had to have an ice cream cone to get the taste out of my mouth.  What a child.  What a child.  God, everybody can have a salad.  What a child.  And then I had to visualize all the way to work today.  Kenny licking an ice cream cone.  Just him with a dunce cap licking an ice cream cone.  It don't taste too good, mother.  Do you have to give them to the people physically? 
[01:27:00]  Or is there like a deposit box?  You put it down there.  No, you give it to, you know.  You give it to them?  You give it to the bag man.  It doesn't jingle when you shake the envelope, does it?  I wish I could jingle.  You tell Ty Webb I'm gunning for him.  You do cash help?  Cash, I don't want them having my personal checks.  Oh, you know what?  Maybe that's the best way.  Cash.  They'd probably rather give cash.  Cold, hard cash.  37 envelopes.  And I still got to take care of eight guys in the garage. 
[01:27:30]  Eight!  I don't want to give cash.  Eight guys in the garage.  You know why I don't give cash?  Because it's easier to steal.  Like one of them, I mean, chances are they wouldn't.  But people could steal from each other and then they'll think you didn't tip them.  So that's why I do check.  Because I'm afraid of somebody stealing.  Well, here you go.  And you felt the pressure since Thanksgiving.  The pamphlets.  And then they're right, as soon as you walk in my building, they're right there, too.  In case you threw it out, if you got it as mail, thinking it was junk mail.  Oh, my God. 
[01:28:00]  Their pictures, what they do, their titles.  With the Happy Holidays thing.  It's like, shouldn't you just tip people?  I'll say this.  I recognize most of them.  Like, it's Cash-22 because it's a lot of people.  But it is a large building.  And it's like, I've worked in the industry where you relied on them.  I certainly did with being a caddy.  It's like, yeah, you got to do it.  It's one of the downsides.  It sucks.  That's something.  But you have to do it.  I got to do the mailman, the garbage man, and the landscapers, I guess. 
[01:28:30]  There you go.  And that's it.  Where can I convert money, dollars to pesos, for the landscapers?  Deutsche Marks to dollars.  Is there a Deutsche Marks to dollars for us?  Deutsche Marks.  I haven't seen those in a while.  And someone's asking, don't you pay maintenance?  Yeah, we do have maintenance.  You're right.  But you're paying the guy.  It's just tipping.  You pay for a lot of things that you tip.  Dude, no choice.  I felt like I had no choice.  Here you go.  Here you go, Kenny.  37 envelopes. 
[01:29:00]  Has the electrical engineer done anything for you?  I don't know.  Who knows?  I'm just thinking, shouldn't you know if you're tipping somebody?  I know all their...  I don't tip.  I've seen all their...  So that I'd be.  I'd be Buscemi's character.  I've seen all their faces, and I know I got money in those envelopes for people I've never  met before.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I lived in a building.  But I'm not even going to take a chance.  You can't take a chance.  I don't know what they do to you if you don't.  I lived in a building in Brooklyn.  I never tipped.  Oh.  I never tipped anybody.  And you know something?  I got just as crappy service as the people that did tip. 
[01:29:30]  Believe me.  But that's...  In the building I live in, they're actually really good.  Like, they're all nice.  They're all very respectful.  Yeah.  They're really great.  I mean, it's like...  And I don't mind it as much, because they all make your life easier.  And I like them.  And I'll say the same thing Jimmy said.  I live in a great building, and I do like the people.  But I just felt...  I feel like it's...  They put a lot of pressure on you.  It's like, all right, we get it.  It's not a tip anymore.  It's a mandatory charge, is what you're talking about.  Don't disguise it as some holiday gift or tip. 
[01:30:00]  It's a mandatory charge that comes...  It's a tax that is put on you at the end of the year.  When you hand out a pamphlet with their pictures and stuff, Anthony's absolutely right.  Because you know what?  I would do the right thing.  I would definitely tip people in my building.  No problem.  It's not even about that.  You just nailed it, Ant.  That is what is really pissing me off today, that it's turned into a mandatory thing.  So just put it into the maintenance fee and let it go throughout the year or something. 
[01:30:30]  Right.  And then divvy it up that way.  Now I'm worried there's not enough money in some of these envelopes, because you don't  know.  You didn't give them all the same?  No, because some people do more stuff.  Yeah, there's guidelines.  There's guidelines.  Did you know?  Did you make suggestions, Kenny?  No, this is a big thing.  He had to talk to a guy to figure it all out, because we don't know.  So he gave us some guidelines.  There's guidelines in everything.  How much is the most you put in there?  A couple hundred in one envelope.  Okay. 
[01:31:00]  That's effing crazy.  That's like for your super, though.  Gentlemen, let's not...  You're making it sound just, but that's for your super, though.  Gentlemen.  Your super what?  Superhero that saves your life on a daily basis?  He might deserve that.  Let's not lose sight of the holiday season and what a joyous occasion is.  It's better to give than to receive.  Really?  Holiday season.  When it comes to beatings...  Yeah.  Oh, jeez.  Now they're all behind the couch.  The rubber band broke.  Uh-oh.  Look at the interns are going to come scrambling. 
[01:31:30]  There's your holiday season.  This holiday sucks.  They were in alphabetical order.  Of course they were, you creep.  Go get another ice cream cone.  You've got some work ahead of you.  I don't want to tip the...  I've got to tip the gym people.  Those are the ones I don't know.  Of course.  I'm in the gym.  Just look at you.  You know you don't know the gym people.  I know the garage people I don't know.  But you know what?  They get my car fast.  Gee whiz, Jimmy.  I call down.  They'll get my car in like 12.  They make your life easier.  Yeah.  And you're around them constantly.  We do pay a pretty hefty maintenance charge to begin with. 
[01:32:00]  I agree.  And our car's not sitting there for free either, by the way.  Of course not.  But I mean, it's one of the few annoying things.  I openly hate Christmas every single year.  But these guys, you know, they're going to...  Look, I would hate to open the door for people all day and like just serve people.  So would I.  It's called a job.  You're getting paid for it.  You know.  Wait.  And I don't want people to confuse the issue.  I like the service.  And I'll take care of people for that service.  But I just felt like, holy crap, we're being pressured in. 
[01:32:30]  And aren't they all union anyway?  So they're probably making an arm and a leg.  Dude, I don't...  Making an arm and a leg.  Yeah.  A lot of money.  They're making a lot of money anyway.  And it's not like...  Just listen to Buscemi's friggin' speech in Reservoir Dogs when he talks about tipping  and the waitresses.  The fact that they get tipped is because they make crap money.  And he goes off on this whole thing about tipping.  And these guys make a lot of money probably throughout the year. 
[01:33:00]  And then to tip them for what?  I don't like being...  For what?  For what?  I don't like being told that I got to tip people.  I would tip people on my own.  Maybe it's for the other people in the building that don't know any better.  I don't know.  Don't forget.  But there you go.  Look.  37 envelopes.  One of the reasons...  Did you find them all, Kenny?  No.  There's more back there?  Oh, no.  Wait.  One of the reasons is this.  Kenny's on all fours looking for the tip envelopes I threw up through against the wall. 
[01:33:30]  Some guys work the night shift.  And they wouldn't wind up making any because people don't recognize their faces.  But they do a lot for you.  It's like, you know, I don't know.  I hate doing it because it's like I don't want to spend the money.  But it's like, eh.  You know what happens?  Whenever anyone goes above and beyond the call, I tip them.  And I've always done that.  Like, if there's a big package that has to be brought up and the doorman or the maintenance  guy gives a hand to bring it up or a delivery guy comes to the door and delivers something, 
[01:34:00]  I'm the first guy to pull out cash and tip people.  I tip as I go, too.  Yeah.  You tip as you go.  It shouldn't be this mandatory tip.  Then it's not a tip.  The guy comes up, unclogs the toilet real fast for me, he gets a quick 20.  He's elbow deep in the bowl?  Jesus, you're going to give that guy some cash.  He gets a quick 20.  He's like, no, no, no, no.  I'm like, no, here.  Quick 20.  Go.  Have lunch or something.  I take care of those guys, too.  Yeah.  I tip on the way.  But.  As I go.  I don't tip when the doorman get me cabs. 
[01:34:30]  They do all the time.  I do.  At five in the morning.  I do.  I don't live in a building like that, but as far as hotels go and stuff, absolutely.  You tip the guy if he gets you a cab.  Well, I would do the same thing at the.  I don't.  In the building, because I'm going to tip him at the end of the year.  That's why I don't.  In the building.  Because those guys, for every time they put bags in the car for me, or take, or open  the door, bring your luggage in for you, all that stuff.  To me, that's what you're tipping them for at the end of the year.  Call your women that.  What's that?  Don't call your women that. 
[01:35:00]  Put a bag in the car.  It's a bag.  A whole.  No.  You know what I mean?  To me, you're tipping because of all the things they do for you over the years.  And, you know, over the year.  Yeah.  So it's just easier to do it at the end of the year.  It's a nice Christmas tip.  All right.  I bet it was such a different spirit of that years ago.  Sure.  Before it became this mandatory thing.  Is that a tax write-off, by the way?  Does anybody know?  I don't know.  A gift?  I would guess it probably is.  Hopefully.  And, yeah, well, Christmas used to be a different thing, too, back in the day.  Oh, they're calling me Anthony Kumiawitz. 
[01:35:30]  But he's not there.  Anthony's a generous guy.  It's just the fact that I'm being told to do this.  Let's go to break with that laugh right there.  That's a good one.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Opie and Anthony, bad boy radio host.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony, bad boy radio host.  Opie and Anthony, bad boy radio host.  Opie and Anthony, bad boy radio host.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:36:00]  Phone number 877-212-O-N-A.  Let's say hi to Jim in Buffalo.  I said F to Sabres before.  Someone couldn't figure it out. 
[01:36:30]  But their ice skaters were better than my ice skaters last night.  Their ice skaters.  That's what I was getting at.  What's up, Jim?  Hey, what's up, guys?  And to Mike.  And to Mike from FMQB, F you.  Taunting me before the game like you were.  Go ahead, Jim.  You know how Jimmy said that he pays once a year, you know, he tips once a year?  Like with those guys, yeah.  Does that mean he moves like every 10 months?  No, Jimmy's settling down finally.  He used to move a lot. 
[01:37:00]  What do you mean, sir?  But you don't have to pay.  Oh, okay.  Oh, no, no, no.  No, I don't mind it that much.  It's a little irritating.  The moving expense would be more than tipping.  Of course it would be.  It'd be silly.  The change of addresses, I'd lose checks.  It wouldn't work out, sir.  That'd be ridiculous.  Hey, Jimmy, are you coming to Buffalo?  Yes, early next year sometime.  The tour dates are on my myspace.com slash Jim Norton.  There's a bunch of tour dates that are tickets going on sale Saturday morning, I think.  Yeah, you're moving to bigger rooms in the new year. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, this Friday.  I'm hearing things.  This Friday, Saturday, I'll be in Scranton at Wisecrackers.  You know, because I'm going to crack Wise.  You're going to crack Wise, and it's Wisecrackers.  Yeah, it's Scranton.  Oh, that's funny.  It's the name alone.  After the new year, I'm not doing any more small rooms.  I used to drive through Scranton all the time.  It's a fun place.  I don't know.  I used to drive through Scranton all the time on my way back to western New York.  I want to slide down the hill like that guy in the Harry Chapin song, 30,000 pounds of bananas. 
[01:38:00]  I want to slide down on my back and just die before I hit the bottom.  I want to slide under a tractor trailer like Harry Chapin.  Oh, yeah.  Good old Harry.  Old heart attack on the road Harry.  Don't lose your hopes too late.  Hey, you got tickets for the New Year's Eve show to give away, Jimmy?  This would be a good time, I'm thinking.  Okay, yeah.  Yes, how about this?  Wow. 
[01:38:30]  I'm sorry.  You know, it's so fun watching you try to pull it together and failing miserably.  All right, here's the prize pack for my mediocrity on New Year's Eve here at the North Fork Theater on Long Island.  One pair of tickets to my show and a pair of VIP passes and a VIP parking pass, so you get to come back and say hello.  I'm happy to meet you, take pictures, whatever you want.  And we're going to give away two of these, the first two callers.  And the, what's the word?  Phrase that pays?  Phrase that pays.  I was going to drop the C-bomb. 
[01:39:00]  What?  Cats glow in the dark.  That's the phrase that pays.  Wow.  You call Travis and say that now, but you have to yell at this stupid ear.  Sharpton is getting, his people are getting subpoenaed. 
[01:39:30]  I don't know exactly why.  Yeah, it's some kind of deal with the tax and contributions when he was running for president.  Matching funds, things like that.  He's managed to skate every time.  Every time.  I hope they get him on something.  How great would it be to see him go to jail?  Mm-hmm.  He's guilty of something.  He's guilty of something, that guy.  Well, obvious reasons.  And because he's...  It might be for not paying parking tickets, but I'm telling you, there's something going 
[01:40:00]  on there.  His lawyer is saying, or his people's lawyers, whatever it is, saying that he hasn't been  not under investigation.  Like, he's constantly under investigation for something.  And he never is found guilty of it, which I don't think is true.  I think he's had some problems in the past.  He had to return $100,000 because of the election money that he gathered up during the presidential  election.  But, I don't know, maybe they'll get something on him this time. 
[01:40:30]  So, I think, I always thought with that thing he has, what is it, the Action Network, the  friggin' whatever.  Action Network.  Yeah.  Something's going on there.  He's very well dressed.  He takes limos places.  I've heard tell of many expensive restaurants that he's been spotted in.  And where's this money coming from?  Where's it come from?  Contributions.  Yeah.  The point is, he has white people figured out.  He certainly does. 
[01:41:00]  He knows what fruits most white guys are.  We will not, yeah, for the most part, will not question what he does.  Occasionally, someone comes in like this, has an investigation, but everyone's too much  a baby to really pressure him.  There you go.  Hey, we got a couple other things we want to get to.  Danny brought in some audio of a man losing his mind at a Brooklyn Post office.  He says this is really, really good.  Really good.  The guy just loses his mind. 
[01:41:30]  And anyone that has, you know, waited online or in line.  Drives you batty.  Drives you nuts, doesn't it, Jimmy?  Batty.  Oh, the people, they don't know what to do when they get up to the counter.  It takes forever.  I know.  Going postal in the post office.  Perfect name for it.  Watch out.  Just going postal.  Does that mean really slow?  Get out of here.  Give me those bricks.  Get it.  Danny, what do we know about this guy?  Unfortunately, not too much, simply because the clip starts with him in mid-tirade. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  So I don't know exactly what it was that set him off, but, I mean, if you ever spend time  in the post office.  I know.  Whoa, whoa, watch out.  Hey, you're postal.  First and funny, it has a lot of packages.  Yeah, I know.  She's got to get out for the holidays.  Oh, God.  What are you, who are you, working for Santa Claus?  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Shouldn't you let the elves do that?  Whoa, hey, whoa.  Who am I to say?  How many stamps do you need there?  Two million?  I will say, though, the post office and the motor vehicles have both been easier experiences  the last times I've gone. 
[01:42:30]  They've seemed to, especially motor vehicles, there's like, you know, computer updated, a  lot of it.  Yeah.  Much easier experience.  Boring.  All right, let's listen to this guy losing his mind.  Goodbye to you forever, because I have your job.  Yeah, same to you, honey.  Same to you.  Get the manager over here.  I want the manager.  Is this real?  It sounds...  Oh, yeah.  This is real?  Oh, yeah.  Is there a video of it?  Yeah, there is.  Is it just the person trying to make their YouTube video? 
[01:43:00]  I'm very suspicious.  No, I don't think so.  I'm one of these very suspicious guys right now.  I have seen this clip in the past.  It just kind of resurfaced.  Yeah.  The past couple of days.  But I've seen this before.  It's totally real.  You can tell by the video.  This isn't...  And what?  This guy started losing his mind.  Someone, what, turned on their cell phone or whatever?  Yeah, I guess he had started to lose his mind, and that's how the video kind of came  about, because I guess the guy saw what was going on and just got a cell phone and started  recording, so that's why it kind of starts right in the middle.  Right.  But, yeah, it's totally real.  I mean, cops do show up at the end of this clip, so... 
[01:43:30]  You don't try to make a YouTube video in a federal building like this.  Like this, you know what I mean?  Like if you're trying to act wacky, you do it like on a Walmart.  Yeah.  You probably don't do it in a government building like a post office.  All right.  Manager.  See how long you have your job, sweetie.  Ha!  Who the hell do you think you are?  Who the hell do you think you are?  I'm the customer.  That's who the hell I am. 
[01:44:00]  And so...  You know, and so...  We'll see when your job comes up for review.  Oh, God.  It's Don Wickland.  Oh, yeah.  That's your job.  That's your job, sweetie.  Ha!  I love this dude.  Ha!  This guy is an ass.  He's the greatest smug employee.  Good for you, pal.  We all like to think we get somebody fired, but nothing's going to happen. 
[01:44:30]  Not at all.  She's going to take her beating.  You're going to move on, and that's that.  That's your job, sweetie.  That's your job.  Do your job.  That's your job.  You go to hell first, bitch.  What's that?  You bitch.  Get the manager out here.  Ha!  Out here!  I want to hire this guy for voiceover work.  I want to have him voice track, like, one of my commercials for a gig.  He's the greatest. 
[01:45:00]  I want him to say my name.  Jim Norton!  Jim Norton, sweetie!  I just love how, through the entire video, that little bell keeps going off so that they  could help the next customer.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  What's he look like, Danny?  You could really only see him from the back, but he's, you know, some just balding Jewish  gentleman setting him off.  He's a Jewish guy, yeah.  What?  She's not going to be working much longer.  How dare she?  Who the hell does she think she is?  Who the hell do you think you are? 
[01:45:30]  I'm the customer, you stupid bitch!  We need t-shirts made.  I'm the customer, you stupid bitch.  You stupid bitch!  I would love to know what led up to this, what she did that annoyed him so much.  Yeah.  She didn't have any three-cent stamps.  No, it's probably, I'm going to say it's her fault.  Probably is, yeah, yeah.  These people behind counters, man, they get on these power trips, and every once in a while  you get somebody, they just, you know what, you lose your mind. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  You're right.  I'm just saying, I wouldn't know from personal experience or anything, but, you know.  This guy seems like he could be a little nitpicky, I bet.  This guy seems awful, though.  But, uh, there's probably a combination of the two.  You put them both together, ah, like a snake and a mongoose.  You ever, uh, you ever wait on line at the bank and, uh, hey, with my tongue and it's  and you, uh, yeah, linger longer.  And, uh, that's a linger longer.  And, uh, you go up to the teller and then she gives you an attitude because she didn't, 
[01:46:30]  she didn't push the light, turn the light back on and makes you go back to the front of the  line and then waits a few minutes knowing that she's just effing with you and then she  pushes the light.  Uh-huh.  Does that happen to you and you want to, like, reach through that weird, you can't  get your hands through a glass thing and choke her out?  Why do they think it's like that?  It'd be a bunch of choked out employees behind the counter.  But they actually get pissed if you walk up before they put that light on for the next  customer.  Mm-hmm.  That never happens to me because I always have a gun and a note. 
[01:47:00]  Let's go back to this guy.  I, uh, we got a bunch more from him.  Yeah, the customer's always right.  You were wrong.  The customer's always right.  You were wrong.  You were wrong.  You're an ass.  You stupid.  And there's a whole generation, you stupid bitch.  I want to speak with the manager.  I have the postmaster on the phone.  I want the manager at the door right now.  Right now.  Give me one of each. 
[01:47:30]  Give me the manager and I'll calm down.  I want the manager.  How dare she speak to me?  You're not the manager.  I'm Mr. Sook Dio.  You're not the manager.  Who's the manager now?  No, we'll speak.  Oh, she look gay.  Oh, yeah.  She's the manager.  What's her name?  I know she's there.  I have eyes.  Your name, you're the manager. 
[01:48:00]  What's your name?  I want the manager.  Right now.  I have the postmaster's number right here.  I want the manager right now.  I have the secretary on the phone.  I want the manager.  How dare she speak to me like that?  I'm the customer.  We're all the customers.  I went to her window.  I asked for a manager.  I have to have more clerks come to the window.  How dare she speak?  Who the hell does she think she is?  Someone's suggesting, give it to Stephen Jackson from Jersey. 
[01:48:30]  It's the penguin from Batman Returns.  That's a good reference right there.  But isn't it amazing like how, and I've been in this situation too.  You really can't say it.  As I'm saying this, I wish someone would just go, shut the F up.  But in that situation, you don't understand.  Plus, I don't know what she did to make this guy this angry.  But I was in a Rite Aid, and there's a guy in front of me, and I was trying to get my stupid sinus medication.  And he said, I'm the customer, and I'm here for your help.  And he was giving up.  He was not this bad. 
[01:49:00]  But he looked for it.  And I almost said to him, shut your mouth.  I was just, my jaw was shifting.  And I didn't because I was afraid it would turn into a fight.  And he didn't look like a very threatening guy.  But it's like, you can't just punch him in the face.  You're going to be fighting in a drugstore, yeah.  I'm 39.  Yeah.  I'm going to hit a man for being crazy.  But do you ever say it?  See, my problem is I say it every once in a while.  I'll tell you why.  And then I'm like, oh, boy.  Is this the day I get my teeth knocked out?  They're not venting it at me.  I'm only annoyed because I have to hear it.  But they're really not addressing me. 
[01:49:30]  And I could, A, see myself in their shoes probably half the time.  And, B, it's like, you don't know.  If someone is genuinely crazy, they're scary.  If someone's really crazy, we'll just bite you.  I just want to know why whenever I walk up to a counter,  whenever I walk up to pay for something, to get a prescription,  whatever the case may be,  I am there for the absolute minimum amount of time it takes  to complete the transaction physically, 
[01:50:00]  for me to physically hand something over,  to be physically handed something and leave.  Because you're considerate.  When I'm behind somebody, it's this big to-do.  Yeah.  The people in front of me, everything is this big project  that just takes forever.  There's a problem.  This one doesn't have this.  And then the women that don't know how to get the F out of the way  before you start shoving crap back in your purse  and rearranging your goddamn life in your stupid bag, 
[01:50:30]  slide that whore bag over to the side  and let me start my business.  These old, old hags.  Yeah, they get their changed purse.  They got to put that back together.  They got to put that.  Then they got to get their wallet back together.  And they're arranging it.  They're arranging everything while you're sitting.  It's inconsiderate people.  The world's full of them.  Slide over.  Full of them.  This guy's being inconsiderate because when you see the video,  we'll give out the link in a minute here,  there are people now being just, you know, 
[01:51:00]  Steve from Bayshore.  No, but there are people now that have to wait a lot longer  because this guy's losing his mind.  But it's amazing how, like, there's a great movie called The Incident.  It's an old movie, 1967, with Martin Sheen.  I think it's his first film, and Tony Missanti,  about two guys that kind of overtake a subway car.  And it's mild compared to what you see today,  like where they're taunting each individual person on the subway car.  And it's so weird in public how people will not help each other. 
[01:51:30]  People have a mob mentality, and they'll attack something horrible  because there's safety in that number.  But it's weird how people won't –  and I'm not saying this guy should have been a tackle  because he really wasn't threatening it.  He was just yelling.  But it's like we don't come to each other's aid  until it's absolutely necessary.  Until it's absolutely too late.  Like on the train.  Like all those –  if there's something happening on the subway or whatever,  like nobody will come to anybody's aid.  Yeah, yep.  We just don't –  we're really self-centered and distant when it comes to stuff like that. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, when somebody's yelling like that in the post office,  wherever you are,  you'll rarely see someone step up and say,  hey, hey, keep pipe down.  Well, their emotional level is so far beyond where yours is.  There's nothing worse than having to fight some guy who's in a rage  when you really are just annoyed because he's yelling.  But there should be like five people at least that should be going,  hey, hey, you.  Why?  This is a very strange conversation.  Shake their fist to me.  Well, it's –  I'm one of the guys –  Oh, really?  Not every time, 
[01:52:30]  but I'm definitely one of the guys at Pipe Up.  Absolutely.  I can't take it as a human.  It depends on what he's yelling at.  It depends on how big he is and whether he looks nuts or not.  I wouldn't even yell at a woman for that.  I told a story where I actually got in a fist fight with a cabbie  through the little square,  like we were trying to punch each other through the square.  It's impossible.  You can't punch each other through that.  He gave it a pretty good shot and I gave it a pretty good shot.  Let's just put it that way.  And then I finally got out of the cab and he got out of the cab and I was effed. 
[01:53:00]  I'll be honest.  I'm not going to sit here and be a tough guy with black belts.  I was effed.  You know, this guy pissed me off.  I spoke up.  Next thing you know, like I'm telling him to give me the exact change back.  He goes, I don't need your money.  And then we start like kind of fist fighting through the little square.  And now it's time to get out of the cab.  And he gets out of the cab.  He would have killed me.  I'm not going to sit here and make believe he wouldn't.  He would have killed me.  Another cab driver came by, saw what was going on, slowed down.  Everything all right here?  And he gave me a look like, oh, next time. 
[01:53:30]  And jumped in his cab and got out.  One time.  Because now I had a witness, I guess.  I don't know why.  But he definitely said, all right, I got to move on from this.  Sometimes you just know, like Keith Robinson's a good buddy of mine.  And Keith, for all his faults, and he's an awful person, is not a coward.  I mean, Keith is an animal.  He's just one of those guys who literally will tangle with anybody, which is a fault.  And one time he said he was coming to the Holland Tunnel.  And he was having a thing with this other guy in this car who was cutting him off. 
[01:54:00]  He did something he didn't like.  So Keith's yelling at him.  And he said they went through the tunnel.  And the guy, they were staring at each other.  And the guy rolled down his window.  And Keith started yelling.  And the guy went, do you want to have a happy day?  Do you want to have a happy day?  And Keith said it chilled him.  Oh, wow.  Because the guy was basically saying, like, if you want to feel good, just leave.  Leave this situation.  And he said it was because he's not a guy that's going to be psyched.  That's a good line.  He just said it completely killed him. 
[01:54:30]  And he said, all right, man.  Well, Keith, you've got to add, Keith is very street smart from Philly.  Absolutely.  So he knew in the tone that this guy wasn't effing around.  Because some people will say stuff like that.  But you're like, you call their bluff.  But Keith would know the difference.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  I mean, he's from an awful area in Philadelphia.  And Keith needs to be, you know, added to the conversation.  Oh, yeah.  He's been arrested.  He was fighting the cops.  He just keeps, he's just a blabbermouth.  He's a problem.  He's a major problem.  I'll yell at old people.  And I'll yell at women. 
[01:55:00]  That's pretty much where I draw the line.  Me too.  Even when they don't do anything wrong.  My team loses.  Yeah.  I mean, who wasn't thrilled on the train that day?  When I just lambasted that old elderly couple that was sitting in the seats in the first class section of the train.  Yeah.  Oh, I was so angry with them.  I'm looking around for a seat.  Like, it's full.  And then the conductor guy comes walking through.  And he goes, tickets, tickets.  And he goes, oh, I'm sorry, sir and ma'am. 
[01:55:30]  But this is first class car.  And you don't have first class tickets.  So I'm standing there with my first class tickets and going, oh, good.  I'll have the seat.  And the guy goes, we'll pay the extra to get the seats.  And then the conductor goes, all right, I'll see what I can do.  I go, nope, wait a minute.  Here's my first class tickets.  And I go, you two can move.  Just get up and leave.  And they were, like, looking at me.  And I was aggravated because we had almost just missed the train and everything. 
[01:56:00]  And I was like, get up.  Get up.  Leave.  Yeah, it was pretty uncomfortable.  Yeah.  And then I was the jackass.  Kind of weird to see Anthony in that situation.  I'm the bad guy.  But, yeah.  I don't yell at people like that.  Sometimes I will.  Because I think if they were 6'5", would I?  I try to talk to old people.  Yeah.  Like, so, like, would I do that if they were 6'5"?  I monitor myself in the car.  Oh, yeah.  We all do.  I wouldn't.  No.  No.  You kind of size up the person you're going to mess with and hope for the best. 
[01:56:30]  Hope they don't know a little karate.  Did you ever feel like, so I had a cat who made me so angry.  Like, do you ever feel like physically, we all think, like, yeah, I could kill somebody.  But did you ever think, like, if I had a gun, I understand completely that I would murder this person right now?  Like, for real.  All kidding aside, no banter, nonsense.  Like, I know I would shoot this person.  That would make me feel better.  A good punch to the face makes me feel better.  Really?  Fight club mentality.  To point a pistol at a cab driver.  Really?  Oh, my heart is weeping right now thinking of that. 
[01:57:00]  How bad they'd feel.  Ah!  How they'd panic with a pistol pointed at them.  Let's go to Cigars and Scotch.  Cigars.  Hey, have you ever seen the video of that crazy blonde-haired guy punching the token booth?  Linger longer.  There's no video.  I'm sure there is some surveillance video they laugh at.  Well, Cigars and Scotch is definitely bringing up something I talked about in the past.  And then someone on Instant Feedback is pointing out that I do get in fights in very strange situations.  I did try to go after a subway guy in the token booth. 
[01:57:30]  In his token booth, yeah.  Which is, like, the safest place to be in all of New York City.  Well, they figured out a way to get them.  Yeah, with the gasoline.  Gasoline stuff.  What a bunch of creative people.  Yowch.  That's how they used to get the token booth people.  Because those guys thought they were safe and they would give you a lot of crap and  someone figured out you squirt some stuff in there.  Squirt some gas in there and throw a match.  And they open the door and come out and, you know, go in and steal the money.  Well, I taunted this. 
[01:58:00]  Wow.  It was perfectly scooped to just all splash right into their faces.  Right in.  And, yeah, there have just been people horribly burned.  Really?  Yeah, it was going on for a little while.  But it's being brought up that I get in some weird fight situations.  You're right.  I try to get the guy in the token booth.  I try to get him out and I start punching the token booth, which just hurt my hand.  Of course.  I had a fight through the cab window, that tiny little square.  And, yeah, I fought the French guy underwater.  French guy underwater, yeah.  Yeah, my fights do take place in very strange areas.  The odd.  Odd areas. 
[01:58:30]  Hey, a little more from the Brooklyn guy in the post office before we go to break.  I'm filing a report.  I'm on a filing report right now on her.  She's losing her job.  Give me those filing papers right now.  Firing papers?  Give me a filing report right now.  Right now.  She's lost her job.  I want those papers right now.  Right now.  I'm filing them on the report.  How dare you, sir? 
[01:59:00]  I'm a customer.  I am speaking in a front manner.  And she's still commenting.  Tell her to stop commenting.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  Wow.  Commenting.  Tell her to stop commenting.  In the video, you see a guy.  He's just trying to get his package mailed.  He's ignoring him and trying to get this lady to just take care of him.  The video is going postal in Brooklyn on YouTube and other fine video websites. 
[01:59:30]  It goes on forever.  It goes on for a little longer, but the police show up.  He's not quite as vocal.  Ah, yeah, see.  Of course not.  Yeah, why would you be?  Of course not.  That was a cell phone, it looks like.  Yeah.  Somebody was very clever and decided to, hey, this is good stuff.  How long ago do you think that happened?  You know, for years?  You know, I do remember seeing it probably about a year ago.  So, it's been around for a little while.  Right.  Oh, I would love to bring him into these meetings with the lawyers and the management and stuff 
[02:00:00]  just to argue for me.  Why can't he say that?  He should be able to say that.  Where are the firing papers?  Like, there's papers she can hand them.  Right.  Like, you would hand a gentleman these papers to get you fired.  Yes, fill this out, sir, and I will be let go.  Just hand them back when you're done.  How much do you want to bet later that guy was thinking about this experience while he  had sex with his face in a pillow?  Oh, of course.  Please.  Pushing his hips back angrily. 
[02:00:30]  All right, we've got to take a quick break here, and we'll play What Did We Learn on  the Opie and Anthony show.  Hopefully, we'll get to the top cringe moments of 2007, according to Time Magazine, and another  grimy moment from Big A this time around.  After the break, it's Opie and Anthony.  It takes me away to that special place, and if I stare too long, I'd probably break down  and cry. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, I didn't realize.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  The bit is starting to fade away.  Don't worry.  It's fading away on us.  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony program. 
[02:01:30]  We're in speed round mode.  We're going to play What Did We Learn?  We got E-Rock's first day in prison based on the Cinnamon Challenge thing.  That might start the new bit.  Old bit going away.  New bit might start.  I don't know.  Well, let's see.  Let's see if there's any potential here.  Tim took E-Rock's audio from the Cinnamon Challenge we did the other day  where he almost died.  No exaggeration.  You can check out the video for yourself.  This thing is very close to going viral.  We were just talking about this during the break.  Almost ready to bust wide open.  Almost. 
[02:02:00]  It's getting honors on YouTube.  It's getting there.  It's called Best Cinnamon Challenge Ever.  E-Rock chokes on Opie and Anthony.  This was a real situation that happened two days ago.  He had to go to a doctor.  His throat was closing.  It was bad because he inhaled all the cinnamon powder.  That's what it came down to.  He was coughing out cinnamon clouds, making horrific noises,  where it was obvious he was just begging for a breath of air,  and he couldn't get it.  Check out the video.  It's Best Cinnamon Challenge Ever.  E-Rock chokes on Opie and Anthony. 
[02:02:30]  But Tim took the audio, and it might start something, it might not,  and he did this with the audio.  ONA Films presents Eric Nagel in E-Rock's first day in prison.  Just open your mouth.  He was a man alone on the inside.  They laughed as he struggled with his new daily routine.  Taking on the whole cell block D will not be easy for E-Rock on his first day in prison. 
[02:03:00]  Read slow.  Three of those, f***ing, right?  E-Rock's first day in prison.  Open Friday wide.  Open Friday wide.  Tim lingers longer.  He certainly does.  Very good.  So that might start something.  People taking the audio of E-Rock during the Cinnamon Challenge and doing something with it.  All right.  Hey, the cringe factor.  Time magazine has a list of the ten most awkward moments of 2007. 
[02:03:30]  Would you like to guess one of the moments?  Little Jimmy Norton.  Most awkward moments of 2007?  A few minutes ago, Jimmy in Tom Chiesano's office.  No?  Didn't make the list?  A little late?  God bless Jimmy.  He's a true soldier.  Of course he is.  I'm not allowed to complain anymore because people think I'm...  Don't ask, don't tell kind of soldier, but...  Absolutely.  Because people think I got problems.  I don't want to go to war.  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  God bless you, Jimmy, for that, by the way. 
[02:04:00]  Thank you.  Ten most...  A little passion for the radio show.  I like that.  I do.  Ten most awkward moments of 2007.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  According to Time magazine, so...  I wish I would have more time to think about this.  Yeah.  Go with some of the obvious ones.  Well, I'm thinking...  How about this?  Britney Spears beating up the car with her umbrella?  No, but Britney Spears is in there, so you're on the right track.  Shaving her head?  Her zombie dance at the MTV...  Oh, I forgot. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, that was pretty bad.  That was awful.  That's number six on the list.  Okay, you're there.  You're there.  What else there, Jimmy?  Um, Condoleezza Rice having that, uh, that paint thing put in her face.  The what?  Wait.  The person with the red hand, those...  Oh, my God, no.  I forgot about that, though.  Very good.  Don't tase me, bro.  No.  Don't tase me, bro.  Maybe this list stinks.  Well, it's a fun moment.  Don't tase me, bro should be on there.  Well, maybe that is more fun.  Wasn't awkward.  That was funny.  Well, yeah.  How did I laugh? 
[02:05:00]  Well, number 10...  Well, Brittany's was too.  What's number 10?  Number 10 is, uh, Rudy Giuliani's kids, uh, saying that they're not gonna back him for  president.  That was a bit cringy.  His own, uh...  Oh, okay.  His own kid saying, uh, the one kid said he, or he or she, I'm not sure which one, would  vote for Obama, and the other one said, I will not campaign for my father.  That's good.  Stupid, spoiled children.  Yeah.  Number nine, you got...  Father wants to run the country, and you're gonna campaign for Obama.  Obama, how...  Just, what a face slap they need.  Yep.  Your father was the mayor of New York during 9-11. 
[02:05:30]  Maybe he's not perfect.  Maybe your mother wasn't doing the right thing.  Hubba, hubba.  There you go.  God almighty.  Support the guy publicly, you disgusting kids.  Where do you think the clothes you're wearing come from?  Just rich kids.  You think the name...  Maybe they don't use the name Giuliani.  Maybe they use the name Hanover.  Hanover.  Who knows?  Yeah, but, uh, that made the list.  Uh, number nine, if we have the clip, I should have gave this list to Iraq ahead of time.  Miss Teen South Carolina says Americans don't know about geography because they lack maps.  Okay.  Mmm. 
[02:06:00]  Might remember that.  Fox Censors, Sally Field at the Emmy Awards.  That's eight.  I think that was one of the most cringeworthy.  But this is Time Magazine, you know.  They gotta play a little safe, you know.  You figured they'd be in touch, though.  True.  Well, seven.  Rosie O'Donnell calls co-host Elizabeth Hasselbeck a coward on The View.  That made the cringe factor list.  Who wrote this up?  Linda Stacey from The Post?  Yeah, these are all the...  Sectoral moments.  It's because it's time.  Yeah, I know.  Look at the source.  But they have, like, political stuff. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  Number six is Brittany.  Five, family values Senator David Vitter.  Yes, good old David Vitter admits his number is in the so-called D.C. Madam's Little Black Book.  Oops.  All right.  Well, that's another holy roller idiot that got caught with his pants down quite literally.  And cringe factor that Larry Craig didn't make the list.  How did that not make the list?  Come on.  Now that I think about politicians here.  Yeah, I guess that's not quite as cringeworthy as Sally Field having her speech cut off. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  I guess a senator toe-tapping with a handsome cop.  How about a little...  And then saying, no, I'm not gay.  And then eight more guys come out and go, I did it.  I did it.  I did it.  He did me.  I was the bottom.  I was the top.  That's not cringeworthy.  But Sally Field, I'm getting to finish her speech.  Idiots.  Number four, David Hasselhoff, drunk in the shower.  All right.  That's a good one.  And eating the hamburger and all that.  Wait, what's...  Hold on.  What's another...  Right, right.  I was just...  What?  Dog the Bounty Hunter's phone call? 
[02:07:30]  No.  No, of course not.  Go with the funny...  No, the other one where...  What's his name?  Calls his daughter a little pig.  Alec Baldwin?  Alec Baldwin?  That would be number three.  Oh.  A rude little pig.  Yes.  It's amazing how Dog the Bounty Hunter's not.  No, I missed stuff.  No, of course not.  No, I missed stuff.  That wasn't awkward.  Not at all.  But Sally Field, not getting that final statement in because she was babbling, the flying nun  couldn't finish her sentence.  Right.  That deserved to make the list.  Number two, Paris Hilton cries for her mommy before going off to jail. 
[02:08:00]  Whoever wrote this list should have their feet severed.  It's the ten most awkward moments of 2007.  Wait, you forgot number...  According to Time Magazine.  Four.  What was number five and four after Britney?  No, we did it.  The senator and David Hasselhoff.  Oh, okay.  And number one is the Columbia University president, Lee Bollinger.  He invites the Iranian president to speak on campus.  That's number one.  Cringe factor.  But that wasn't cringy because he smashed him.  Why would that be cringy?  No.  He smashed him.  Lee Bollinger won me over with his awful...  Yeah.  ...with that stupid throw rug on his head. 
[02:08:30]  I'll give you the...  I'll give you the number one cringe moment.  Yeah.  I'm sorry I did that.  I'm embarrassed that I did that.  That was a cringe moment.  But they're trying to be smart by doing the Lee Bollinger thing.  They're trying to...  You know, like they put that and Britney in the same list.  Yeah.  Morons.  And then suggested a new number one that we forgot about.  Oh.  And that would be reading this list on the radio.  Yeah, that really was.  Damn! 
[02:09:00]  We just had a who gives a crap moment on the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, wait.  Can I say thank you to someone on the air?  My friend Dr. Steve sent me a marble chess set, which was so nice for Christmas.  Really?  Thank you, Dr. Steve.  I appreciate that.  How do the pieces stay on?  Wouldn't they roll off?  I haven't opened...  I just got the box.  Oh, material.  Okay, that's silly.  I thought they were marbles.  No, it's not Chinese checkers.  Remember that awful game?  Oh, I hate that.  I love Chinese checkers.  Oh, I'd love to make 80 jokes about it, too.  I used to love that game. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, of course.  There you go.  Hey, what's that?  I don't know.  What the heck was that?  I was going to make a joke at how, you know, the checker pieces would look different.  Sure.  Checker pieces.  How come these checkers have smaller genitals than your normal checkers?  Stupid board games.  It's just like chess. 
[02:10:00]  Hey, why don't we do another Grammy moment?  Play checkers with almond-shaped pieces.  I don't know.  I don't think anyone's hearing this, so...  Maybe.  It's all right.  All right, listen.  Here we go.  Another Grammy moment.  This one features Big A.  This is worth playing before we get out of here today.  He looked good yesterday, though.  I've never seen anyone look more like a psychopath than Big A yesterday.  Sarcasm.  I've got to really keep that in my head.  You looked... 
[02:10:30]  Because his hair was matted to his forehead.  Andrew, you looked crazy yesterday.  He has really like Adolf Hitler hair.  Yes.  It is just...  After he's done with one of his Nuremberg speeches, it just...  It's pasted to his forehead.  Oh.  And he's got a Herman Goering body.  A little history joke about fat people.  I want...  I want to...  I want to compile...  Wow. 
[02:11:00]  My Volkswagen just flew off the Autobahn.  Well, we don't all know the actual pant size of war criminals.  Don't get it, man.  Oh, my God.  Who was that joke for?  Ivan Boesky?  Oh, wait.  I have a wrong reference.  Can you crash me, please?  Yes.  Oh, fuck.  Pant size of war criminals.  I meant to say Ivan Damienyuk.  I said...  Damienyuk.  Yeah.  We should compile a list of the top ten craziest Opie and Anthony listeners by look  alone.  Wow. 
[02:11:30]  But we were just talking about the other guy.  I look alone.  Big eyes.  Eight through one is Andrew.  We need two more.  No filter, Paul.  Now, people would step up and go, I'm the craziest Opie and Anthony listener.  No, we're looking for the people that look the craziest.  No filter, Paul is one of them because he has a head like a chihuahua.  He has a tiny head with giant eyes and nothing going on in between the ears.  That would probably be no filter, Paul.  A head like a chihuahua.  Yeah, it's just tiny.  I might have to put Cromwell up there on the list.  Cromwell.  Cromwell.  Who's the guy that hangs outside?  He looks like Bluto. 
[02:12:00]  He's really a good fan.  He's always at the events and stuff.  He gets us to sign pictures.  I don't know.  I've signed like 30 pictures for him.  For the same guy.  I know who he is.  He's a good fan.  He's just nuts.  Yeah, I know exactly who you're talking about.  Of course you do.  He looks crazy.  Good reference, actually.  Here is the Big A Grammy moment before we get out of here today.  It's an Opie and Anthony Grammy Minute.  Song of the Year.  Hey there, Delilah.  Plain white tees.  Hey there, Delilah.  Don't you worry about the distance.  Right there, you get lonely. 
[02:12:30]  This song, another listen.  Close your eyes.  This is my voice.  It's my disguise.  I'm by your side.  Oh, it's what you do to me.  Oh, it's what you do to me.  Oh, it's what you do to me.  Oh, it's what you do to me. 
[02:13:00]  Expand the Grammy knowledge base with Opie and Anthony.  All right, listen.  These Grammy moments, it's supposed to be fun and stuff.  Now we're all, that one just creeped everybody out.  Yeah.  That one was a bit too creepy.  Yeah.  It's the type of thing he would sing while he was quietly strangling a woman named Delilah.  Like he would sing it to himself, not her.  What you do to me?  You hear his voice going, oh, what you do to me?  Oh.  As the bone saw just cuts, cuts through. 
[02:13:30]  He should be wearing like Leatherface's, like apron.  That's a big Asian hat on, Leatherface's apron.  It's all stained with ancient blood of hookers gone by.  Well, we didn't get to play.  What did we learn?  We'll do it real fast.  Bob in Jersey, go ahead.  Hey, boy.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, boy.  I learned today that if I'm ever in a weird place and an angry blonde-haired whiskey boy  comes by, get the F out of there.  Yeah, I want to openly admit I'm just stupid.  I don't think I'm that tough. 
[02:14:00]  I'm just stupid, though.  Thank you, Bob.  Let's go to Mike in Missouri.  Mike.  I learned that Anthony is gay because he couldn't ask girls out, including Charlie.  All right.  And finally, dead bent.  We end with you today because we're running out of time.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  I learned E-Rock gagging on a Tuesday sound.  No difference from him choking every other day.  Oh.  You guys suck.  Another E-Rock.  Joke.  All right. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, check out the E-Rock video.  That's what we say today.  Best cinnamon challenge ever.  Oh, yeah.  E-Rock chokes.  Watch it, man.  Almost died.  E-Rock chokes on Opie and Anthony.  It's almost going viral.  So, we're out of here.  We'll see you at XM.  If not, have a good day.  Lance.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  I love you. 
[02:15:00]  I love you. 
[02:15:30]  I love you. 
[02:16:00]  I love you. 
[02:16:30]  I love you. 
[02:17:00]  I love you. 
[02:17:30]  I love you. 
[02:18:00]  I love you. 
[02:18:30]  I love you. 
[02:19:00]  I love you. 
[02:19:30]  I love you. 
[02:20:00]  I love you. 
[02:20:30]  I love you. 
[02:21:00]  I love you. 
[02:21:30]  I would love you. 
[02:22:00]  I love you. 
[02:22:30]  I love you. 
[02:23:00]  I love you. 
[02:23:30]  I love you. 
[02:24:00]  I don't know you at all. 
[02:24:30]  I love you. 
[02:25:00]  I love you. 
[02:25:30]  I love you. 
[02:26:00]  I love you. 
[02:26:30]  That's a very funny name. 
[02:27:00]  I don't know what criteria is used for scoring. 
[02:27:30]  You look at that picture. 
[02:28:00]  I love you. 
[02:28:30]  I love you. 
[02:29:00]  I love you. 
[02:29:30]  I love you. 
[02:30:00]  I love you. 
[02:30:30]  I love you. 
[02:31:00]  I love you. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, I love you. 
[02:32:00]  I love you. 
[02:32:30]  I love you. 
[02:33:00]  I love you. 
[02:33:30]  I love you. 
[02:34:00]  I love you. 
[02:34:30]  I love you. 
[02:35:00]  I love you. 
[02:35:30]  I love you. 
[02:36:00]  I love you. 
[02:36:30]  I love you. 
[02:37:00]  I got the old man. 
[02:37:30]  And they're like, yeah, sure.  Like, I thought I was going to have to go through, like, a thousand.  Well, I'll explain it because I'm giving it away. 
[02:38:00]  Okay.  All right.  The Tranathlon is a contest where multiple trainees compete in a three-part event in  order to be crowned the first Opie and Anthony Tranathlon champion.  The first round will be a talent portion up to the individual trainee.  The second round will be a swimsuit competition.  I had a little funny joke.  It's just minus points for visible duct tape.  I wasn't going to read that, but I figured I had to.  And then the third round.  That's a safe way to get it out there.  Who do you think you're doing?  Who are we, your fucking aunts and uncles we don't recognize who you just did there? 
[02:38:30]  And the third round will be a bench press competition.  The winner, the trainee, being who benches the most.  Rounds one and two will be scored with 10-point scale.  Round three, 10-point scale, but extra five points for the most benching.  The judges, there will be three judges, hopefully consisting of comedians from the show,  who will be responsible for giving the scores,  but more importantly, giving the trainees the ridicule that they deserve.  Good luck ridiculing trannies.  They're nuts.  I've caught you with a fucking razor soaked in garlic. 
[02:39:00]  Do you mind?  They're men.  I'm kidding, of course.  I'm kidding, ladies.  You're not.  I've heard you've...  Ladies.  I've kicked in myself, didn't I?  I've heard you've been online, kind of like trying to find some contestants.  Yeah, I have.  Actually, let me see.  I'll tell you how many I got right now.  Have you talked to some of these people?  Yeah, and surprisingly...  You keep tranny numbers in your wallet.  Yeah, I got it.  That's great.  It's mixed up with my massage card.  Let me get it out of the way.  Hold on.  I walked in on him, like, weeks ago, and he's just on the phone, and he did his own idea. 
[02:39:30]  He just picks up the phone, and I look at what he's got on the computer, and he was  trolling through Craigslist, looking for trannies and calling up their phone numbers and saying,  Hey, I'm with the Opie...  No, I'm with XM Satellite Radio.  Ah, yeah, there you go.  Contest in studio.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.  Six out of the seven said they would do it.  They just need a date, and the other one wants to know about money, so, you know, I figured  that the Rately Hour...  I didn't say anything about the money. 
[02:40:00]  Rately Hour?  The Hour Rate.  Hourly Rate.  Have you been with a tranny?  No, no, no.  I've never been with a tranny.  Okay.  But I just know...  You know, I've been on Craigslist before, so I've seen, you know, the trannies when you're  trolling by all the time.  How'd you find the trannies?  What'd you search in the Craigslist search engine?  Just tranny.  That's it.  T for M.  You know what I'm talking about, right?  T for M?  No, gee, I've never seen that one.  Why don't you just ask me if I use DOS prompt to log in? 
[02:40:30]  Fuck.  So, I mean, yeah, I don't think finding them would be a problem.  It was a long time ago that I talked to these ones, but they were so, like, not really concerned  about it that they would do it.  And what are the three events again?  Bench pressing?  Well, that's the payoff.  The first one, you know, they come in and do a talent and then a swimsuit.  So, I guess they kind of think it's real.  And then we bring out the bench press.  And whoever.  Yeah, that's like the one who's going to win, really, because they get extra bonus points.  I didn't tell them. 
[02:41:00]  I just told them it was going to be a talent, a swimsuit.  I didn't mention them.  And they're ready to go.  Yeah.  Like I said, six out of seven.  We're like, yeah, just tell me when and let me know.  Oh, my God.  We might have to do that one.  That's right.  Okay, and then there's the bonus part where everyone has to sign and say, whoever recognizes  Jim has to pretend they don't.  No, that could be it.  I just want to make 100% sure that another show didn't do it.  That's all I care about.  No, I mean.  So, it's a big concern.  If I'm sure somewhere along the line somebody is at a tranny and they're like singing or something. 
[02:41:30]  But I don't, the big payoff for me, I'm thinking on this bad.  Because the connections are big.  No, I think bench pressing.  I don't think tranny's bench pressing has ever been done on the radio.  Okay.  Yeah.  If I had to think about it.  I mean, if we have the guys in, I think it would just be hilarious.  But you said, I don't know, maybe they'll punt somebody.  So, maybe you've got to think about that, too.  You know.  Okay.  All right.  I think it'd be funny.  There's definitely something to do with transsexuals. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  Sure.  I like Homeless or Penthouse the best.  Yeah, that's a good one so far.  You like the name?  I thought it might have been a little too hacky.  Penthouse Pet or Homeless Bull Sweat.  No, whatever.  We can fucking rework the name.  Pet Sweat.  Actually, the name is pretty funny.  I like that.  Shoehorn a few words in.  I like that.  I like the fucking, I like the crab one.  And I like the transsexuals.  There's three of them I like.  The duty one is fine.  It's very creative.  Yeah.  Okay.  You got more?  Yeah.  Well, I have the name that poon we could do. 
[02:42:30]  Name that poon.  Yeah.  You got all the other ideas out?  Yeah.  The other ones I have, I just have another one, but it's not really done.  And I was kind of right.  You know what?  I'll just do it.  Just do it.  Take a risk.  Nah, let it rip.  Yeah.  All right.  It's called Here Comes the Bride.  You know, everybody knows a wedding can be very stressful, and it's also taxing on the  old pocketbook, you know, especially for the bride.  From making all the arrangements, to writing her vows, and most of all, picking out her  special dress.  This bit allows the bride to relax as well as save lots of money. 
[02:43:00]  So, you know, we get somebody in here to sponsor dresses.  Now, Opie, we all know you're getting married, so congratulations, by the way.  Thank you, sir.  I will not be part of that.  Oh, we can find a sponsor to supply a dress, and the groom could try it on in front of her.  Oh, wait.  You don't need money for a dress, and you're the star of the show.  Oh, he's going into a bit mode.  Only if we had someone else who was getting married.  Oh, boy.  He's improv-ing.  E-Rock's getting married. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, is he?  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  That changes everything.  That changes everything, doesn't it?  No, but that's why.  I just kind of, I don't have it.  What the fuck was that?  What is that?  I don't know what you did.  That's Tony writing.  He wanted to get an E-Rock joke.  Let me sit.  Let me sit.  Let me sit.  Here comes the bride.  He wanted to sound like he just came up with it.  Yeah, yeah.  No, but I never really finished it.  It was like, you know, we get a sponsor to bring in dresses.  He actually wrote, now Opie. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, this is the conversational piece.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's, you know.  You should be shot with a shit gun for this.  Hold on.  Let me.  Now Opie.  We try to do diarrhea fucking super soaker.  Remember they said no to that.  Now Opie, we know you're getting married soon.  Congrats.  He actually wrote with a little carrot, a little upside down fucking boomerang.  Congrats.  You squeeze in congrats.  Congrats.  Congrats.  It's too long.  We will find a sponsor to supply multiple dresses for the groom to try on in front of  her as she relaxes and kicks her feet up. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, the groom will try on dresses.  Oh, wait.  Uh-huh.  You want me to try on a fucking wedding?  And you're the...  He actually wrote that?  Oh, wait.  Is it written?  Oh, wait.  The worst part's coming up.  Okay, okay.  And I guess you didn't know if you were going to read this at CBS or over here.  Yeah.  Oh, oh no.  Oh, and then he puts like three dots.  Wait.  Three more dots.  You have plenty of money and you're the star of the show. 
[02:45:00]  Darn.  Yeah.  It's CBS.  Darn.  Darn.  All right.  They can't help you.  What's this?  What's this?  Are we going to do this after the fucking festival in Doc Hollywood?  What the fuck is this shit?  Darn.  Oh, well.  You actually wrote out your reactions.  Hold on.  Oh, well.  If that's an H and a bunch of M's, I'm spitting in your face.  Is that what that is?  Right there.  No, no, no, no.  I scribbled out the word. 
[02:45:30]  Okay.  I was going to spit on you.  Oh, well.  Only if we know of someone else that's getting married soon.  Did you fucking improv a little joke?  Like you wrote down like a little funny reaction.  Yeah, yes.  A little.  Hold on.  The reason why.  Like you and the boss were going to bond and he was like, come on, you know I can't do  that guy.  And you're going to go, darn.  Honestly, I'm not even kidding.  I wrote that.  You guys were watching me write that thing in the same way.  I was planning on presenting that bit the same day or the next day.  You say present.  Very weird. 
[02:46:00]  It has to be brought to everyone's attention.  I say present, but I should say present, right?  Doesn't matter.  No, you say present.  Present?  Present, yes.  Look, I fuck up a lot of things, so I'll acknowledge that.  But he's got prezazz.  But I'm noticing the present is said a little differently.  Oh, darn.  Oh, darn.  All right, go ahead, Tony.  All right.  That's it.  So now I have the one that we flushed out here.  Ready to go.  Did you finish the one you were just trying to describe, though?  Oh, well, yeah.  It's really funny because the banter he wrote in was so organic. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, well.  Only if we know of someone else that's getting married soon.  I hope the sponsor brings some sample sizes.  Say, are you about a size 14?  I like that.  He liked that bit.  Is that written?  He liked that line.  It's written.  If it would hurt the paper, I'd bite it.  We got a name for your homeless game, though.  I think Dana from Minnesota nailed it.  Dana, what's up?  Morning, guys. 
[02:47:00]  Dana.  You're hilarious.  I can't wait till you come to Minneapolis.  Thank you, buddy.  Hey, I got a good name for your underwear game.  You guys can call it Penthouse or No House.  Oh, that's good.  Penthouse or No House isn't a bad idea.  Shorter.  Punch it out, gentlemen.  Brings in the homeless angle.  Homeless.  Brings in the hotness angle.  All right.  All right.  We're going to do one of your bits.  All right.  We decided to do Name That Poon.  All right.  Sounds good.  Do you want to do it after the break so we can take leaks?  I got to take a piss.  And me and you should do a little naming of our own.  All right.  Now, Jim, will you be participating in one of these games? 
[02:47:30]  Will you?  Yeah.  Well, now, you make enough money.  I don't think you should.  Let me think of somebody that could.  Well, I'll tell you.  Well, now, Ant, since you're the host of the show.  I think we could find someone else, parentheses.  E-Rock.  Oh, shit.  I read that.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Dot, dot, dot.  Dot, dot, dot.  We're actually going to do one of your ideas next, Tony. 
[02:48:00]  It's Name That Poon on the Opie and Anthony Show.  In just a bit.  Lovely Nordic nymph, jiggly Jimmy Norton.  Know that paltitude is real.  It's real.  Smooth, amoeba-like skin.  Smooth where it counts.  Shaved like a booksome baby.  As hairless as a toad.  Too much for one man.  Without a bastard.  Shaved like a booksome baby.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:48:30]  Ah.  Getting ready to do Tony's Idea here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Name That Poon.  Tony's Idea.  How do we play, Tony?  Like that.  All right.  What I got is, I got some audio from Celebrity Sex Tapes.  Did you?  I used to play this game.  Yes.  The host is going to, which will be me.  I'm going to read a clue for a clip and the players.  Who decides you're going to be the host of Name That Poon? 
[02:49:00]  Oh, well, I don't have to be.  I just have the cards.  Anybody else?  You might want to, said, if it's okay with you guys, I want to be the host of my game  that I came up with.  You know, by telling us these, you are also giving up all rights to said games.  They are now in possession of us.  We own the rights to them now.  It's almost like a band with their first record deal.  You get fucked in the ass.  Yeah.  Teasing, of course.  All right.  I'm going to read a clip. 
[02:49:30]  I'm not.  Read a clip.  And then, all three of you guys are playing, right?  O'Bain and Jim.  Yeah, didn't you write that dialogue again?  Oh, well, Wade, you're all three of you.  Oh, I forgot to.  I had to get more seats.  Oh, drats.  He's got to write everything he says.  Oh, he's the worst.  There's little dots so he knows where to pause.  You never spoke of English.  You write English, but I would have to write German.  Like, he wouldn't know to pause if he didn't.  Give me that paper one more time, briefly. 
[02:50:00]  He would just plow right through it.  All right, whatever.  Damn it.  All right.  Like, if you didn't write your pauses in, like, he wrote it like, uh, kicks your feet  up.  Oh.  Wait.  You have plenty of money.  You would have just barreled through that.  Oh, wait.  You have plenty of money in your star of the show.  Darn.  Oh, well.  Only if we do.  Hey, uh.  Oh.  Wait.  Oh, wait.  Spock.  He's doing fucking Shatner impressions of me. 
[02:50:30]  That's right.  Oh, wait.  You're Bones.  You're the doctor.  Bones.  You don't need this.  Yeah, I need the guys to look into the Mitchell Report.  I don't know if this is true, but Crisco from Grand Rapids writes, stupid Roger Clemens'  name is featured prominently in the Mitchell Report.  Dot, dot, dot, dot.  Goodness gracious.  Goodness gracious.  Well, who doesn't think Clemens is taking steroids?  He's 57, and he's still fucking striking everybody out.  Of course he is.  He should be.  Of all the dramatic things, Roger Clemens is moving his foot like a horse and Steinbrenner's 
[02:51:00]  walks.  Roger Clemens, his buttocks are showing.  We look at the dugout syringes are in everybody's asses.  We got anything on that yet?  I was not part of this last five seconds.  Oh, boy.  No, that's good.  The Mitchell Report might be out.  Steroids, baseball, that whole thing.  Okay.  You know something?  I'd rather get that than one of the EROC where he tries to cover.  It's like Dan was like, no, it wasn't part of the last five seconds. 
[02:51:30]  I was doing something.  I came in.  You can respect that.  What do you got, Travis?  It's not out yet.  Shut up.  I don't know what he's talking about.  All right.  Well, that's why I'm asking.  That's all.  Not yet.  All right.  All right.  Name that poon.  Let's go there, Tony.  Don't let Anthony compliment you on the air.  It's degrading to the host.  Now let me call him to see if it is.  It's a flip you the bird.  Dan, have a talk with Steve.  He flipped me the bird.  Will do.  I'll just text him. 
[02:52:00]  Yes, sir.  Sorry to interrupt.  Okay.  Yeah, so you guys are going to alternate bidding on how few seconds you guys are going to need  to identify the celebrity who's getting banged, as in, I can name that poon in three seconds.  Oh, like name that tune.  But instead it's poon.  Yes, it's poon, which is slang for pussy.  I get it now.  All right.  Oh.  How about we just play, like, how long is each track? 
[02:52:30]  I think the longest one is a minute and a half.  Dude, but that doesn't go by the rules of name that poon.  He was fairly insistent on going by the right time.  You got to go like, I could name that poon in, and then a certain amount of seconds, I guess.  And then the person goes, well, dot, dot, dot, name that poon.  All right.  I'll, I can name that poon in zero seconds.  Oh, you want to hear the clue yet?  Jesus.  Oh, oh, the clue.  Zero seconds.  You're ruining the game.  Zero seconds.  All right.  There's only four sex tapes out there. 
[02:53:00]  I'm going to take a shot here.  I'm going to go with Pam Anderson as my first answer.  No, don't ruin it.  My second answer is going to be Paris Hilton.  My third will be Kim Kardashian.  And my fourth guest.  Amy Fisher.  Amy Fisher.  And fifth is China.  Go ahead.  And fifth is China.  There we go.  All right.  Name that poon.  Go ahead.  All right.  Let's just go clockwise here.  I'll read the first clue.  And then you start the bidding.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Once gracing the pages of Playboy, this annoying bitch rose to fame in the early 90s. 
[02:53:30]  Jesus Christ.  I cannot, I can name that poon in zero seconds.  I got more.  Okay, good.  This is tough.  Oh my God.  Fortunately for us all, the only thing that fell faster than her career was her pushy husband  in order to fuck her doggy style in this video.  Okay.  Now let the bidding start at one minute and 30 seconds.  I will name that poon in 30 seconds.  Anthony, name that poon. 
[02:54:00]  One second.  One second.  What?  All right.  So he has to name it because one second there's no more.  Jim, name that poon.  All right.  Pam Anderson.  Hold on.  I got to play the clip.  I got to play the clip.  Go ahead.  I'm trying to stick with the game.  Go ahead.  Pam Anderson.  And it is indeed.  You are indeed wrong, sir.  You are wrong.  You are wrong.  Now.  Say smart asses.  You'll play the rest of the clip and I guess whoever just says it first wins, I guess. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, all right.  Hands on buzzers.  Hands on buzzers.  Dakota Fanning.  Baby, no.  My scar is on there.  Hey, come watch me see the scars and see the difference.  Here, this is the scars.  God, you're a fucking mouth.  Take the bra off.  Now.  Drop the candy.  Just let him go. 
[02:55:00]  You are.  You've been.  You're going to freak me.  See this.  Oh, my God.  Turn.  All fours.  Peter is sticking out.  I got it.  Dorothy Stratton right before he shot her.  All right.  I guess nobody got that one.  No.  Tough one.  Gina Lee Nolan.  Yeah, but we didn't hear the fucking part.  Well, he was flipping around.  All right.  Hold on.  We got to at least, you know.  Gina Lee Nolan?  Got to get something out of this bitch.  Which bitch is that?  No one knows who she is. 
[02:55:30]  No, baby.  Go on all fours.  All right.  Hold on.  Doggy.  Go doggy.  My babies are hurting.  Oh, my God.  I'm really bad.  Stop your bitching.  Okay, prick face.  God, you know.  Selfish one.  I'm in pain.  See the ass.  Smile for daddy.  Move towards that wall.  Daddy.  Stop.  Stop.  Face the camera.  Perfectly framed.  Put your hands forward.  Stop.  I don't feel comfortable here. 
[02:56:00]  Baby, you're going to hurt me.  You're hurting me right every minute.  You're doing that.  I mean, I can't see what you're fucking doing.  Creep.  I'm in pain.  Is that you care?  No.  I am.  I'm in pain.  Who's fucking it?  My bra is hurting.  It's an old dude.  What?  I think it's her husband that she divorced a while ago.  She just had tit implants.  That's what she was complaining about when he was fucking her. 
[02:56:30]  They were bouncing around.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  What's that?  What year is that?  93.  93?  94?  Cool.  I just guessed.  All right.  You got to open it.  I'll say I'm keeping track.  So I get a point for that.  How?  You didn't guess it.  What?  You didn't guess it.  Yeah, I said Gina Lynn.  Okay.  That's important.  Gina Lee Nolan?  What?  That's it.  Who is she, by the way?  She's on Baywatch.  She was on Playboy.  All right.  That describes everybody that's made a sex tape or a drunk tape. 
[02:57:00]  All right.  Here's the second clue.  Oh, we'll start with you, the bidding, after I'm done.  This multi-talented gash made her fame through sports, music, and reality TV.  Even though she has not succeeded in any of these, she certainly succeeds in making your  dick limp in this video.  I could name that poon in a half a second.  All right.  Well, it's 102.  You want to go with the one second?  One or two?  No.  102 is where you start at.  One minute and two seconds. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, I'm going to go with one second.  One second.  All right.  Then take a shot at it.  Go ahead.  All right.  You'll stop it after a second?  Yes.  One second?  That's ridiculous.  One night in China.  Bang!  Give me one for the boss.  Wow.  One for a rope.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Wow.  And I even cut out the obvious part of that fucking.  Which was what?  Cock or wrestling?  What obvious part?  I heard silence in my one second. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  You heard nothing.  No, no, no.  I mean out of my clue.  All right.  Now we get to hear her get banged.  Okay.  Looks good.  Does that feel comfortable?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know what you're going to do.  Ugh.  You want to hold that?  Yeah.  Ew.  That looks so hot.  Awful cock. 
[02:58:30]  Her awful cock.  That was nice.  No.  It looks like a fleshy dunce cap.  Fucking juicy clip.  Meatpack.  I'm going to leave the faucet running.  What is she watching? 
[02:59:00]  What up, baby?  What is she watching?  How long is this clip?  No.  One minute.  It's kind of big right there.  Man, it's big.  Why wouldn't you get like the real crazy like screaming?  There really wasn't that much in that video.  She was like terrible.  All right, Tony.  All right.  Clue three.  Jimmy, this one will be for you.  All right.  I'm done.  They say money can't buy you happiness, and apparently it can't buy you dick-sucking skills  either.  This slit shows us why sometimes it's just better to go home and jerk off. 
[02:59:30]  Start the bidding at one minute and forty-nine seconds.  Ten seconds.  Really?  It's a mess.  Five seconds.  Wait, wait.  Can you guys say I can name the poon?  I can name that poon.  Oh, thank God.  You OCD freak.  I can name that poon in five seconds.  I can name that poon in two seconds.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You got to turn.  But I already said it.  No, you said ten.  He said five. 
[03:00:00]  Now Oaks got to be five.  I didn't say I named that poon, so I said it the only way you wanted to.  Oh, nice.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Thank you.  I got five seconds.  I apologize for yelling at you.  Five seconds.  Out of time.  But you said ten.  I know.  No, I didn't.  You can't change it.  I said five.  Wait, hold on.  You know, you're a good host.  You should be like Ray Combs.  Someone find this kid a closet.  I can name that poon in ten seconds.  All right.  I can name that poon in five seconds.  I can't name that poon. 
[03:00:30]  You got to tell him to name it.  Why?  You're going to play it.  Because if you don't think you can beat it, you say name that poon.  What about Jimmy, though?  Yeah.  Does he go back to Jimmy?  Yeah.  Back to Jimmy.  So what do you need me to say?  You don't want to guess lower than five.  You tell him to name the poon.  Name that poon.  I can name that poon in four seconds.  Jimmy?  Go ahead and name it.  Me?  Now it's to me.  Can I hear the clue one more time, sir?  Sure.  They say money can't buy you happiness, and apparently it can't buy you dick-sucking skills either. 
[03:01:00]  This slit shows us all why sometimes it's better to just go home and jerk off.  So she didn't suck the cock good.  That's your clue in there.  Okay.  Well, I can name that poon in one second.  Wow.  Let him have it.  Yeah, his first clue was too obvious.  Go ahead.  All right, ready?  Turn off the Tony music.  Yep.  Yep.  I hear it. 
[03:01:30]  That poon is Paris Hilton.  We got a tie.  Nice job.  I didn't get to guess.  I knew that.  Because you should have then bid zero or one.  Oh, I actually thought it was Terry Schiavo.  Oh, my God.  I don't like coffee, huh?  I don't like coffee.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  This is tremendous shit.  Fuck your fault. 
[03:02:00]  You know what I'm saying?  You know what I'm saying?  You know what I'm saying?  Why don't we just nod?  We don't need to listen to this fucking thing.  Fucking spray.  It stinks to hear it.  It's supposed to be that.  Yeah.  You can see better now.  That should be face punches.  Yeah.  He's breaking our fucking copies of our CD in half.  It's hard to think. 
[03:02:30]  It's hard to think.  Can I just turn around to go back?  No.  I don't like it.  That's hard.  All right.  Knee on top, baby.  Mm-hmm.  You just get behind.  Just get behind.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  She started shitting all over his dick and pubes.  He just jostled loose some of that fancy, rich buffet food. 
[03:03:00]  She started shitting brown brie cheese all over his fucking shaft.  Fucking Velociraptor-footed slut.  Okay.  Do I have it over here?  Come on.  I want to come right up.  Uh-uh.  Yeah.  I'm going to drop off.  Fuck it.  All right.  Where's my neck?  I don't want to do anymore. 
[03:03:30]  So she had bad cock sucking in that?  Yeah, she wasn't very good.  I disagree.  I thought she sucked a pretty good dick tongue.  She had to really be coerced into it.  I like that.  Well, Rick Solomon is packing a huge mule.  I wouldn't want to fucking work on that if it was her, either.  She just wants to relax in the sun.  All right.  Silence was actually more than I deserved.  You should have attacked me physically and I couldn't have complained.  Fucking running out of steam zilch. 
[03:04:00]  Son.  How many more of these we got?  We got five.  I have five.  Wow.  It's up to you guys, whatever you want to do.  It's up to you.  You're the host.  Yeah, you're the host.  That's pretty well so far.  Let's do skip one, go to the next, go to the one after that.  Okay.  All right.  Hellstar, you went after the clue.  Her boyfriend's bushes in the first jungle this cunt has had to live in.  Her appearance on this certain show might have been a sleeper, but her appearance in  this video sure isn't.  Yeah, that's right. 
[03:04:30]  She's a fuck pig.  Why so angry?  One minute and 11 seconds.  Wow, that's a tough clue.  That's a tough clue.  Can't really get much out of that.  I'm going to have to say I can name that poon in eight seconds.  What's the clue again?  Her boyfriend's bushes in the first jungle this cunt has had to live in.  Her appearance on a certain show might have been a sleeper, but her appearance in this  video sure isn't.  Okay, I have no more needed.  Oh. 
[03:05:00]  I can get the answer.  No.  In seven seconds.  Oh, would you just say the poon?  What happened?  It's not how you're supposed to say it, I don't think.  Well, Tony was all right.  You all right with that, Tony?  That's fine.  That's fine.  I can name that poon in 3.5 seconds.  Ooh.  That's going to be a tough one for Than to figure out the .5 when he plays the clip.  I can name that poon in 3.3 seconds.  Oh, jeez.  I'm going to get the answer after listening to 2.7 seconds of the audio. 
[03:05:30]  Wow.  2.7 now.  Why are you getting itchy?  Because I'm not following the rules?  The OCD freak?  Another OCD freak among us.  I can name that poon in one second.  I know the answer.  Ooh.  Name that poon, Jimmy.  Let's play the clip, man.  All right.  Play the clip, man.  Jenny Piccolo.  I'm sorry. 
[03:06:00]  That's incorrect.  Now, I got to...  You guys just go whoever says it first.  All right.  Let her rip.  God, you motherfucking great dick.  She lived in a jungle on a reality show.  Survivor.  Survivor.  Huh?  Get the moose.  Moose.  I'm stuck.  Oh, jeez. 
[03:06:30]  You know why your mom and dad are getting all the credit for genetic?  What the fuck?  I'm the moose.  You're not talking to my mom.  Can't be fucking moose.  Take the fuck me harder.  It's the broad with the...  She had twins.  I think she was on the first season, and her name is...  Beverly D'Angelo.  Beverly D'Angelo.  Her name was...  She did our show.  Tam or something. 
[03:07:00]  I forgot her name, but she had twins.  I know that.  That hose bag that used to come in?  Hose bag that used to come in.  No, that was Kim.  Yeah.  No, not Kim.  All right.  That was the hose bag I was talking about.  From the first season, she's got a weird nose.  Nice hose bag.  It's like her nose...  She's almost cute, but she has a weird blocky nose.  Yeah.  I win?  Blocky nose girl?  You need a name.  Get ready.  I'll give you another hint.  JL initials.  Yeah, I know.  Jenna.  Last name?  Give it to the boss.  Gina Lola Brigida. 
[03:07:30]  Jenna Lewis.  Jenna Lewis from Survivor.  She used to do our show.  John Lovitz.  Let's hear how she...  Jack LaLane.  Jake LaMotta.  Joey Lawrence.  Jerry Lewis.  Jerry Lundergaard.  I didn't get on the job.  I didn't get on the job.  For your camera?  Yeah.  Oh. 
[03:08:00]  Fuck.  God damn.  Jesus.  Like.  Back.  Oh.  So fucking good.  Yeah.  She likes that.  Yeah.  Lib.  All right.  Let's, uh...  All right.  Let's hang this game up.  Okay.  That's it.  One more.  Well, that means I win, which is...  No, we got one more.  That would be a good place to end this time if I win.  Go ahead.  What?  One more.  One more.  All right.  All right.  One more.  All right.  Play the last one there, Thane.  Is it nine or eight? 
[03:08:30]  Eight's the last one, I believe.  All right.  All right.  Who do we leave off on?  Oh, this is for you here.  The Academy...  This Academy Award winning slut didn't start out in Hollywood making cinema classics.  She started out like a good girl should, sucking cock on camera for real.  57 seconds.  What?  An Oscar winner?  She was Academy Award winner.  That's a fucking Oscar.  Fucking Oscar.  I'm sorry. 
[03:09:00]  I'm nervous.  I'm just reading from the paper.  Academy Award.  Oh, not an Oscar.  An Academy Award.  Shit.  What a douche.  Academy Award winner.  Someone wants to know how he managed to make fucking boring.  No.  All right.  Wait.  What's the cool again?  I know this for anyway.  This Academy Award winning slut didn't start out in Hollywood making cinema classics.  She started out like a good girl should, sucking cock on camera for real.  57 seconds to start.  I will guess... 
[03:09:30]  I must remember this.  I do know that.  You do?  Mm-hmm.  Of course.  I know a lot about the Oscars.  I'm going to go with...  It's one you wouldn't think.  I'm going to go with Estelle Getty.  You have to...  How many seconds?  Going back a ways.  Yeah.  You got to say, I can name that poon in, and then you give seconds.  The answer will be given to you after listening to this for a mere 65 seconds.  It only goes up to 57. 
[03:10:00]  You're not playing by the rules.  Oh, my God.  You can't get the rules.  55 seconds.  You got to get the rules.  I can name this poon in 10 seconds.  Wow, really?  I can name this poon in zero seconds.  Wow.  I don't even need to hear the clip.  I know I can name this poon, but I don't feel like naming this poon.  If her initials are T, although I will hit you.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Ant.  What do you got?  Halle Berry.  Sorry.  Hold on, hold on.  What did you say, Jimmy? 
[03:10:30]  If her initials are T, L, I'll hit him.  Oh, okay.  With that, I can name this poon in one second.  All right.  Play the clip.  All right.  Tracy Lartz.  Sorry.  That's why I saw it.  Tina Louise?  It couldn't be.  You said TL.  I'm trying to think.  Oh, no way.  Fuck.  So I think Jimmy automatically gets the point, right?  Yes, he does.  Why?  He's got to guess it.  He don't win anyway.  He only got one, right? 
[03:11:00]  I didn't get any.  No, I knew it wouldn't be Tracy Lutz.  Tony LoBianca.  TL shit.  It's not T.I.  I don't know where that came from.  Oh, fuck you then, Jimmy.  What's the first initial?  C.  Yeah.  Charo.  Charo?  Wait.  CS.  Oh, oh.  I have no idea.  Wait.  CS.  Carmen Santiago.  Where in the world is Carmen Santiago?  Getting fucked. 
[03:11:30]  Brown Bunny?  Hmm?  Brown Bunny?  No, Chloe.  Chloe Sloving.  Yeah, give one to Jimmy.  What's our final score?  Chloe Slover.  Hold on a minute.  I don't think Jimmy should get a point.  Did she start in porn?  Well, it was the first.  It was the Brown Bunny film we all know about where she actually gave head to.  That was a mistake.  Because it was her boyfriend at the time.  Vincent Gallo.  That avant-garde director douche.  He's good.  He did one called Buffalo 66.  It was a good movie, though.  Oh, that sucked.  You didn't like that?  No.  Oh, I like Vincent Gallo. 
[03:12:00]  With Christina Ricci.  Was she in that one?  I like her, too.  I heard she was fucking Lennox Lewis or was that bullshit?  Really?  Was Lennox taxing that pussy?  I heard he was.  Yeah.  Taxing that.  You know Lennox was giving that pussy a beating.  Are you kidding?  Politely.  Going to mash your pussy like...  My.  Potatoes.  Holy shit.  Well, cheer for Tony.  Well, who's the big winner, Sam?  Whoever tuned this out.  Yeah.  Whoever was smart enough to check out the Zeppelin channel. 
[03:12:30]  The final scoreboard has Jim at one, Anthony at one, and Opie at three.  Wow.  Okay.  That's the big winner.  Hit the music.  Why?  There it is.  Congratulations, Opie.  All right.  Tony, good job, really.  Thanks, guys.  I like some of your ideas.  Yeah, you're a clever guy.  Thanks, guys. 
[03:13:00]  All right.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  I just don't care about this.  Well, you know something?  Some people...  Do.  No.  Well, this is a big name.  Source says Clemens will be named in Mitchell Report.  This is from ESPN.com.  Look it up for yourself if you don't believe us.  Former New York Yankee strength trainer says information he supplied to the George Mitchell investigation  regarding supplying Roger Clemens with steroids is included in the Mitchell Report, scheduled 
[03:13:30]  to be released later today.  Brian McNamee, who worked for the Yankees and as a personal trainer for Clemens and Yankee  teammates Andy Pettit also told investigators that on at least one occasion, Clemens was in  possession of steroids from another supplier.  Whoa.  Pettit ratted him out?  What?  No.  Is that what he said?  No.  This guy was a personal trainer for Clemens and Yankee teammate Andy Pettit.  Oh, okay.  Oh, I thought it said Yankee teammate Andy Pettit also told investigators... 
[03:14:00]  No, no.  Oh.  Comma.  Fucking rat.  The comma saved Andy Pettit in that sense.  It certainly did.  The source said McNamee told investigators he supplied Clemens with steroids while Clemens  was with the Yankees and prior to Clemens joining the team.  Also, the Bergen Records, citing a baseball industry official, says several prominent  Yankees will be named.  Oh, my God.  Goodness gracious.  It says...  Giambi is absolutely in there.  We know that already.  It says it's going to be a rough day in the Bronx.  The paper recorded the source is saying. 
[03:14:30]  The babe.  The Bambino?  No.  Who do you think?  Who do you think?  Joe DiMaggio.  He would inject steroids into his fist so he could hit Maryland better.  I'm going to go with...  So when she came home with fucking Bobby Kennedy's seat on her lip, he could punch it off her.  I'm going to go with Don Zimmer.  Do you think the Zim was shooting some roids?  Right into his skull. 
[03:15:00]  He was in position of hemorrhoids.  Or Mickey Mantle.  Sitting on the fat ass.  Mickey Mantle was shooted into his liver to make it more adept at soaking up alcohol.  The Mick.  Yes.  Prominent.  Several prominent Yankees.  So we're not talking, you know, some pieces of shit here.  I know the answer.  Yeah.  Billy Martin. 
[03:15:30]  He would inject it into his forehead to make it more windshield resistant.  Wow.  Oh, I think they're going to uncover that Thurman Munson was found in possession of steroids.  Yeah, he was injecting it in his armpits to try to grow wings so he could fly out of a plane in trouble.  The needle flipped out of his ass and hit the altimeter.  It's being pointed out that this guy's name is McNamey.  McNamey is naming names.  What a McDouchey. 
[03:16:00]  McDouchey, yeah.  McTattletailer.  Oh, this guy, I bet he gets some death threats.  Ah, those death threats are boring.  But Yankees did steroids.  I say bleep it.  Giambi.  A-Rod.  Giambi Clemens.  A-Rod might be a biggie.  You think A-Rod?  I hope so.  Might be a biggie.  Probably in dozens of his cocks when he goes to Toronto and he can fuck properly.  This will change baseball as we know it. 
[03:16:30]  Oh my goodness gracious.  They're just going to allow steroids after today.  They should.  Yeah, they're going to have to.  They should.  They're role models.  It would be bad for the children.  Our buddy BJ Shea lost his producer?  Steve, why?  You know the guy?  Yeah, he's not dead.  No, no, no.  Sorry.  Roger Wood from Seattle writes, BJ Shea's old producer was fired for a bit where they make  over a Pete Rose haircut and send the big-tongued mongoloid out on a date. 
[03:17:00]  Uh, this kid was fired just after the promo aired.  Why?  That's funny.  Holy shit.  Wait.  We got to get BJ on the phone.  Uh, and the bit was called Queer Eye for the Retarded Guy.  That's pretty funny.  Supposedly they, you know what?  They make over on someone that was a little slow.  You know, yeah.  Well, you know why that would get dumped?  Because they're actually addressing it honestly.  Because that is just a voyeuristic thing.  But you, you do it on TV and you pretend you're compassionate, you're, you're, you're sweet. 
[03:17:30]  But if you do it honestly and goof on it, you're fired.  Oh, I did Steve, who's the guy that's his producer now.  Okay.  That's funny.  Wow.  Well, they're saying old producer, but is this new news?  I have not heard it.  Yeah, okay.  Some people are saying Cecil Fielder.  Corey Lytle was on the juice to try and give him the strength to complete left turns.  Jay from Florida.  Sheffield was one who will be named.  And the article does not say that Andy Pettit said Clemens did it.  I know we've corrected that.  Yes, we corrected my misreading of the comma. 
[03:18:00]  Joe Pepitone injected into his nostrils to make them bigger and stronger.  Joe Pepitone.  Joe Pepitone.  It's going to be a bad day in the Bronx, they're saying.  Wow.  That's going to be very interesting.  We'll be all over that tomorrow.  You'd like a wow sticker, Anita.  Jesus.  Do we even give those out anymore?  Oh, hold on.  Someone's calling me while I'm on the radio.  What? 
[03:18:30]  Hi, Mark.  Who is it?  Yes, you are, but I'm on the radio, so I'll have to give you...  Bye-bye.  Oh, I was going to yell curses.  No.  Like you do when I'm on the phone.  No, no, that's a man who's to be taken very seriously.  Mark.  Yes.  He does finances.  And he's a fucking wacko.  Mark.  He's a brilliant dude, and I sat there with him, and he's like, he kind of looks like  fucking, a little like Grandpa from the Munsters, but he's younger, but he's insane.  I hope so.  And he's like a fourth degree black belt. 
[03:19:00]  He's a real weird little fella.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Sounds it.  Yeah.  All right.  You hung up real quick, though, so we couldn't yell curse words.  Of course I did.  I don't like how you do that, because me, it's always, uh, cunt this, and...  While you're in luck, hold on.  Oh.  Hello?  No.  Right.  He's fucking busy.  I just got shushed by Jimmy.  I'm on the radio.  Don't shush me.  I can't, uh, I can't talk right now, but yes, I will be there. 
[03:19:30]  Just, he's busy getting his cock sucked.  Um, ignore that.  I, um, I'll be there by two o'clock.  Did I ruin a part for you?  What?  I hope not.  No, there's no one on the phone.  Nah.  You douche.  You're douchey McDouche douche.  I was good acting, you know what?  You're a great actor.  No, I...  It's Fabasham.  Yeah, maybe I picked up two...  Yeah, it was a little too soon, Jimmy. 
[03:20:00]  Uh, hello!  I can't be with you on that one.  Well, for my time, never...  I answer the phone like that, so...  Right.  It's like...  No, his dramatic, uh...  You are in luck.  It just happens to be ringing right after it said that I was there.  Embarrassed, uh, yet he wants to get the information.  Full Out thing.  That was good.  All right.  You were definitely, uh...  It's obvious that we have to go home early.  Let's, uh, get the fuck out of here.  Look, before this tremendous blizzard comes, uh, blowing through...  Is there a blizzard or no?  No.  This is gonna be about, uh, an inch of, uh, rain.  Line of the Day brought to you?  Are they falling from snow?  Yes. 
[03:20:30]  It's gonna start snowing, um, if it isn't already in our area.  Line of the Day is brought to you by BodogFantasy.net.  It's College Bowl season.  Put your football skills to the test with Bodog Fantasy's College Pick'em Contest.  New copy.  New fucking copy.  Register for the contest in the College Bowl Public Prize League with your Bodog account,  and you can win up to $100,000.  How do you win $100,000 doing this?  You should probably go ahead.

All right?  It's College Pick'em or something like that.  College Pick'em Contest.  Pick'em.  Pick'em.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  She wrote nice things.  She, uh, quoted, uh, lyrics from Hot Songs of the Day and, uh, and perfume on the letters,  all that stuff.  And then I find out, like, you know, later on that she would, that the whole time she 
[03:21:30]  was banging, uh, her ex, who was the quarterback of Central.  Central.  He was behind her, and her face was pressed into the paper so hard, it looked like the  Shroud of Turin.  Shroud of Turin.  She must really love me.  Uh, Shroud of Turin.  Very good.  Reverend Al Sharpton's gonna have a press conference in moments about the trouble he's in.  I bet he's outraged.  I bet this is, uh, uh, uh,  Chargers are unfounded?  Yeah.  It's a, um, witch hunt, um, eh, it's unjust, it's racially motivated, blah, blah, blah, blah, 
[03:22:00]  blah, blah.  I wanna pet a little llama.  Do you really?  What is that little animal?  Oh, those are one of those little things.  Stop, stop shaking, you faggot animal.  Look how cute it is.  That's a paca.  It's a paca.  Alpaca.  Alpaca.  Those things are fuckin' ornery.  They're adorable.  Look at his little haircut.  Yeah, but they are, they're not even tempered, or we'd all have them as pets. 
[03:22:30]  Are they ornery, really?  Oh, they're motherfuckers, I hear.  They look good, but they're motherfuckers.  Yeah, that's a real baby one, too.  Well, they have his fuckin' mouth sewn, is held shut by the...  No, he's just wearing a little bridle.  To lead him around with.  Well, I only like leashes if they're on the neck with spikes in them.  Artie K. from St. Paul writes,  Most of the Mets were on the list that's coming out, the Mitchell Report.  Oh, yeah.  But after their historic collapse, the commission decided they have suffered enough embarrassment  for one season.  That hurts.  A reindeer. 
[03:23:00]  Rachel Ray's bringing out a big reindeer.  Oh, he looks so happy to be there.  Fucking petrified.  He's a fucking, he's a moose with a dumb hat on.  Do you know how fucking annoyed he is with his antlers?  Look at his eyes.  All you see are the whites of his eyes, all scared, shitless.  Yeah, he's like, what the fuck?  He's eating.  He's not even eating it.  He's just kind of pushing it out of the guy's hand.  Oh, do I want him to impale somebody with those fucking antlers?  Yeah.  He's gotta think that God cursed him with that weird fucking antler thing on the top of his head.  Oh, he just wants to pull the sleigh and get the children their toys. 
[03:23:30]  How would all those reindeer land on a roof?  It'd slide off.  I don't know.  His hooves are slippery.  Oh, if he charged at Rachel Ray and just impaled two of her tits, two.  Like, there's more.  Exactly.  Those antlers have gotta be the weirdest thing on an animal.  That's the bit we'll do maybe tomorrow.  Weirdest thing on an animal.  I'm gonna go with the antlers.  Antlers are pretty strange.  It looks like it fucking ran into a branch and it got stuck in his head.  Well, I'll say weirdest thing on an animal is a mouth and horse gag. 
[03:24:00]  Look at this fat-nosed reindeer.  I'm gonna go with oven mittens.  Just to bring the show back to the beginning.  I love oven mittens.  Weirdest thing on an animal.  The kangaroo pouch.  Yeah, that is silly.  That's a little weird, too.  But antlers...  Silly.  If you just take yourself out of it a little bit and kind of think basically about antlers on a fucking thing.  It's kind of weird.  Any kind of horn.  Extremely weird.  Any kind of horns on something.  It's really weird.  It's like a hat and you can't take off. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah, you can't take off your hat.  Oh, look at the little monkey.  That's Rachel Ray.  No, it's not Rachel Ray.  That's what I said.  There was a little monkey on the television.  Just rewind your tape about five minutes.  All right.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  Made for each...  Made for each...  What?  At 14?  I'm not even completely made yet.  Yeah, I'm not even cooked. 
[03:25:00]  Someone was saying alpacas don't have antlers.  We know.  No, we're talking about two different animals.  Andy from Kentucky.  An alpaca has a long neck.  They brought out a reindeer after the alpaca.  The final runner-up line of the day.  Who do you think?  Who do you think?  Joe DiMaggio.  He would inject steroids into his fist  so he could hit Maryland better.  Good call late in the game, these guys.  That was a good one.  They're on their game today. 
[03:25:30]  They don't fudge around.  BodogFantasy.net, thank you very much.  Here is your line of the day.  Here comes...  Here comes...  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Yeah, you're having a nervous breakdown.  If I was like a 13-year-old kid,  I'd be in the bathroom  doing what 13-year-old kids do.  By the way,  if you're going to have a nervous breakdown,  make sure it's...  Just might.  Make sure it's around 7.30  because that's... 
[03:26:00]  7.30?  That's when we have our biggest audience.  All right.  All right.  You will let us know  if that lamb  takes a look at your little display,  won't you?  What the fuck was that?  What the fuck is that from?  It's a good one.  That's going way back, no?  What is that?  That was Poe and Opie.  Wow.  Why me?  I guess you might have been mucking his us.  Or his ki-i, rather.  Oh, his...  Yes, his little yell of power.  Hey, who's giving us the money for money, honey? 
[03:26:30]  We've got to give them a plug  and we've got to try to get contestants for this thing.  It's a week from today, right?  Yep.  2,500 from bodog.net  and a five-day ski package  from skicoloradonow.com, right?  You got it.  Okay.  Just all in my head, I'm so smart.  Do we have any contestants for money, honey?  One.  Well, she'll get all fucking $2,500 then.  If she gets naked,  we're going to, like, smear honey all over you  and then you roll around  and pick up as much money as possible.  We got two?  We might have two.  I just got another email. 
[03:27:00]  Contest on.  $2,500 plus that trip to Colorado to ski  for five days.  That trip alone's worth a grand minimum.  $4,000, they're saying it's worth?  $4,000 ski package.  $5,000, it's going up.  Wow, look at this.  Inflation.  How many euros?  $2,500 cold cash  that you roll around and pick up  if you're willing to, you know,  get smeared with honey  and wear almost nothing. 
[03:27:30]  If you want to be completely naked,  that would be an extra bonus for us in studio.  I'm getting a report.  It's ice storming out.  Leave the city.  Really?  That's what I just heard.  That's my reports that are coming in.  And that's not a weapon.  Oh, God damn.  Was that you?  Yeah.  What happened?  Holy shit, it sounded like a top fuel dragster  warming up its tires.  You farted like...  Bubbles.  It was weird.  You fart bubbles too?  I just did.  I didn't hear it.  My asshole was thinking in a cartoon. 
[03:28:00]  Mine come out sometimes like bubbles in like a mud pit.  Oh, ah.  Yeah, yeah.  It's going to come to the surface and just...  Money, honey is a week from today.  So, ladies, if you want in on this contest,  need a few extra bucks and possibly a trip to Colorado.  Come on.  All you have to do is kind of get naked or get naked.  Please get naked.  And then you smear honey all over your body  and then you roll around the fucking studio for,  I don't know, a couple minutes  and whatever's stuck to your body, you get to keep.  Then you show your titties. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  Show your fucking titties.  Everybody sucks them.  How do people do this?  Suck your titties.  Travis, you can email travis at foundrymusic.com.  That's it?  And who's in the contest?  Red Rum is one of the contestants, I believe.  Oh, nice.  Sexy Red Rum.  So as far as getting nude,  we already have someone setting the bar.  She'll fucking drive nude from Jersey.  She rules.  Yeah, she'll get naked.  She'll walk into the building naked.  I miss her on Pal Talk.  I want to start seeing her again.  She's not shy.  I love Red Rum.  All right.  All right, it just hit me. 
[03:29:00]  What are you doing?  Jimmy's percolating.  That was from before.  I have not farted again.  No, that's what happened.  It took a while to get over here.  It was so thick and viscous.  Yeah.  It's like Pepe Le Pew's fucking coloring  that comes off his tail.  Took that long to get over here.  Hey, Coke Logic,  because I guess he's privy  to some fine inside information.  Or maybe not.  Maybe everyone can do this.  The O&A Shorts on iTunes.  The O&A Shorts podcast  is kicking Bob Edwards' ass.  Good.  How many views, Coke Logic? 
[03:29:30]  Coke Logic is good.  Yeah, Bob Edwards.  Yeah, how many?  XM is probably displayed on iTunes  all this week  as they launched their podcast business.  Go and support that,  because it'll be better for the show and stuff  if you go and support that podcast.  Go learn the podcast business.  Mike!  I'm just waiting for an answer,  then we can leave.  You don't go to iTunes  and run out of steam 
[03:30:00]  on a bit like that!  Wow.  I fucking hit a wall.  The wall was called  The Reality of Mediocre Talent.  I fucking ran  chin and no writing pen  first into it.  Fucking cunts.  Can I finish a thought  before I say it?  I don't think we're going to get our answer.  Are we on a delay?  How long is our delay?  How long it takes  to bounce off the satellite?  A few seconds.  What, Steve? 
[03:30:30]  Steve is suggesting  that perhaps in the meantime...  Well, in the meantime,  did you play  Derek's Anthony  home defense bit?  I thought that was old.  No.  It's new.  All right, we'll play it tomorrow.  Yeah, because of the storm.  I don't know how many views,  but when you sort by popularity,  the shorts are first.  Thanks.  All right, so whoever is checking out  the CokeLogic's animation  on iTunes,  thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thanks, CokeLogic.  He does great work.  Yes, he does.  And thanks to us  for being talented enough 
[03:31:00]  to make cartoons out of.  I mean,  I think he needs to be heard.  CokeLogic deserves an apology.  Turn your friends on  to the ONA shorts.  They're being featured  on iTunes,  the front page  in the podcast section.  We're out of here.  Oh, Cinnamon Challenge.  Keep pushing that video for us.  It's almost,  it's getting ready to go viral.  We're almost there.  What is it called again?  Best Cinnamon Challenge ever.  E-Rock Chokes on Opie and Anthony.  You can find it on YouTube, 
[03:31:30]  Break.com.  Where else there, Steve?  OpieandAnthony.com,  LiveLeak.com,  LiveVideo.com,  fucking 30 other sites.  I don't know.  Really?  It's good.  It's a lot of places.  And what's the feedback so far  from those guys?  Because these guys  have seen it all,  but are they impressed a little bit?  I mean,  like anonymous internet feedback,  it's all fake.  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm talking about the people  that run the websites  that you are in contact with.  Are they sort of impressed?  Yeah, they like it.  Because they've seen everything.  Yeah, they like it.  But we think we have 
[03:32:00]  a good one on our hands.  E-Rock Almost Dying is good.  Yeah.  It's good for everybody.  E-Rock Dying is great.  Yeah, well.  That's not very nice.  I'm just kidding.  No, you weren't.  Eric, I'm sorry.  All right, Eric,  get us out of here.  We'll be right back. 
[03:32:30]  I gotta run.  I gotta run.  I gotta run.  I gotta run.  Don't bump it,  but I can hop at it.  We can really hurt bad.  So do kids grab ass.  Was it like a number?  Why was that?  Was it like a number?  Why was that?  Where is the bell?  Wait for the bell. 
[03:33:00]  Danny's a bell.  Where is the bell?  Dying by the gun.  Dying by the gun.  Dying by the gun.  Dying by the gun.  I was a book a game making.  And paper whoppers.  I was paper.  Would you like a number?  Why was that?  Would you like a number?  Why was that?  Dying by the gun.  Dying by the gun.  Dying by the gun.  Dying by the gun.  Dying by the gun.  In 2002, darkness covered the land. 
[03:33:30]  The Catholic League is praising Infinity Broadcasting for cancelling the Opie and Anthony show.  And evil reigned supreme.  Who, who, Rob Bin?  Until one day, they returned and all hell broke loose.  Bullshit!  Can you hear me?  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio.  Shut up!  One Wednesday, I picked up a guy in a dress and he sucked my dick.  You just sit back and watch what happens next. 
[03:34:00]  Opie.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Anthony.  Away with you!  Away!  Away!  Away!  Leave!  Leave the fucking studio!  Jim Norton.  Every one of you is a time-wasting cocktease.  I will beat children about the head.  And the O&A Army.  Our fans are a bunch of jackasses.  Three men, leading an army from the pits of darkness.  You are shit. 
[03:34:30]  You are worthless.  We're all losing.  I could give a fuck.  Fighting the evil nemesis, poisoning the land.  Tell him, friend!  You're a fucking, you're just a little scumbag and I'll just spit in your fucking face.  I'd love to spit in your fucking face.  Fuck him!  And a battle that almost separated them forever.  I'm an actor.  You're insane.  You don't know how a show works and then you have these stupid opinions.  I understand you trying to do a radio show.  We're not gonna do that, you ass!  Aw, don't get all angry and yell. 
[03:35:00]  Jim, you're fucking pissing me off.  Whatever.  Holy shit.  What happens when love pushes you over the edge?  I gotta feel the tits!  Nowhere to run.  Who is this idiot on the radio?  Nowhere to hide.  You're shit out of luck.  And no way out.  Dance, motherfucker, dance.  Yeah, look at my cock.  The most anticipated thriller of the year.  Give to me the money.  I will make for you the like I fuck.  Ah!  No!  The Opie and Anthony Show.
