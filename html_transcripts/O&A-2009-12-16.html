<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a discussion of Tiger Woods's scandal, comparing its media saturation to the O.J. Simpson trial, attributing the vast reach to the proliferation of cell phones and the internet. They highlighted a Facebook page titled "I Had Sex with Tiger Woods" boasting over 1200 members.  The hosts then heavily ridiculed a poorly made "Don't Go Home With Nope" sign commissioned from "Starker Patty," contrasting it with a professionally done version submitted by "Jimmy the Creep."  They moved on to planning their "Homeless Talent Show," grappling with logistical hurdles like venue booking and audience management, including security and liability concerns, and debating the selection process for attendees.

The show transitioned into a critique of their former station's hiring of Nick Cannon for a morning radio show, mocking the idea of celebrity DJs, and further deriding Citadel Broadcasting's decision to hire Scott Shannon as VP of Programming, given their bankruptcy.  Audio clips of Scott Shannon's show were played and mocked. A brief discussion followed regarding a radio report about a couple having breakfast with President Obama at the White House.  The hosts then covered Barry Williams' (Greg Brady) restraining order against his girlfriend. Professional wrestler MVP then arrived in the studio, prompting a discussion of his recent "Tribute to the Troops" trip to Iraq.  Other tangential topics included Jesse Ventura's 9/11 conspiracy theories and a Smithsonian Channel documentary on the atomic bombings.

The conversation with MVP continued, beginning with a movie-inspired discussion of confrontations, leading into a story about his encounter with Hulk Hogan (initially unnamed). The conversation delved into prison life, prison rape, and humor as a coping mechanism.  Jeff Ross's comedic style was briefly mentioned. MVP discussed his friendship with Sherry Shepard, his views on the Tiger Woods scandal, and the contrast between celebrity image and reality, using Whitney Houston as an example.  They covered wrestling's global appeal, especially in the Middle East and China, and the shift from the "Attitude Era" to a more family-friendly PG rating.  A Burton Love snowboard was given away, with much comedic banter surrounding the selection process.  This segment also included extended, humorous attempts to choose appropriate depressing Christmas music for a Tiger Woods-themed segment, featuring discussions of various artists and songs, including Bing Crosby, and numerous digressions.

A listener's vehement dislike of a Christmas song by the artist Sleeves dominated the next segment.  The song's repetitive "la la la" sections were described as depressing and an "abomination," sparking a debate about its merits.  The discussion strayed into other disliked songs, including a 60s novelty song one host intensely disliked, leading to a guessing game. A listener revealed Sleeves' explanation of the song's meaning on another broadcast. "I Christmas Thee" by Sleeves was also discussed, compared to Tom Waits' style. Opie's stringent ticket acquisition process for an Islanders/Rangers hockey game was discussed at length, interspersed with calls from listeners offering tickets. A sexually explicit song by Dan Warhead was played, followed by a "Guess the Sound" game featuring a graphic audio clip (identified as a vaginal sound) and a call from Victoria, who offered one host a prostate exam and discussed her sex education DVD.

A significant portion of the show featured Dr. Z, a sex expert promoting her "Dr. Z's Guide to Great Sex" DVD.  The hosts and Dr. Z commented on the DVD cover model's breasts. The discussion involved a vulgar conversation about the average duration of male intercourse (less than four minutes) and suggestions for improvement, including oral sex and sex toys.  The legality of the show's content, especially a previous prostate exam on a guest, and potential obscenity complaints were discussed, leading to a crude discussion of various sexual acts.  Tiger Woods' infidelity was briefly touched upon.  The conversation returned to sex advice, covering techniques for prolonging intercourse, finding the G-spot, and various sexual positions.  Dr. Z explained the DVD's structure, based on viewer letters, addressing penis size and compensation strategies.  The segment contained explicit descriptions of sexual acts and vulgar jokes, with listener calls about sexual practices and enhancing sexual experiences.  The DVD and Dr. Z's nightclub appearance were promoted at the conclusion.

The final segment discussed hangover sex, with Dr. Z attributing the enhanced pleasure to endorphin release and relaxation.  The hosts and Dr. Z shared their personal experiences with alcohol and aging.  A caller's questions and anecdotes about semen, its properties, and effects on women were extensively discussed.  Further calls addressed semen consistency, with Dr. Z offering advice.  The segment concluded with a focus on the guests' appearances, particularly the hosts' fascination with Lainey's body and a playful request to see her buttocks ("Heini"), leading to a humorous exchange and comparison with Jimmy's buttocks, also shown on-air.  The hosts expressed appreciation for the guests and planned for a future show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Ah, good morning.  Hi.  Hopi and Anthony, Jim Norton, ready to broadcast what will happen today.  That's what I say now.  Hi, Jinx.  Me trying to fix my mic.  There we go.  Hilarity.  On some hilarity.  Observations.  Yes.  Tiger News, I guess.  Oh, my God.  Tiger News.  One, two, three, four, five, six.  Six new bullet points on Tiger Woods. 
[00:00:30]  We'll get to it in a few minutes.  And another cover for Tiger Woods.  On both papers.  So, I mean, how many days in a row?  It's astounding.  Nineteen in a row.  Nineteen days in a row this guy has been on the cover with this situation.  What's our record?  For real.  I think our record's two or three.  That's not bad.  In a row.  We've had a few in a row.  We've had a few in a row.  I was telling you before the show, Tiger Woods is starting to be almost bigger than OJ Simpson 
[00:01:00]  for the simple fact that we all have cell phones and the information that is being passed around  can't compare to the OJ Simpson days.  As far as information goes, as far as scandal goes, OJ fucking minced up a couple of people.  So, it's just, and the stories that came out, you know, what OJ was up to. 
[00:01:30]  Dude, the whole country watched him right away.  Oh, I know.  But the whole country is twittering and facebooking and emailing and it's everywhere.  I'm holding out hope that this Tiger Woods story is bigger than OJ Simpson.  The thing is, you've got to look at it realistically.  This story is everywhere because of the internet and cell phones and everything like that.  But so was, you know, hand-holding otters.  Right, right.  That's a good point.  You know, I didn't know about this, Spectro, Michigan. 
[00:02:00]  Good morning, fuckers.  There's a Facebook page called I Had Sex with Tiger Woods.  Oh.  Apparently, 1,200 people have had sex with Tiger Woods so far.  1,200?  1,200.  Okay.  Are part of I Have.  I Had Sex with Tiger Woods.  I wonder who's part of that.  Little observation come in today and there's a fine sign over the clock.  Was Starker Patty made that?  When did Starker Patty come in here?  She called me yesterday after the show and she said that she would be coming by to drop off a sign that you had requested. 
[00:02:30]  You know, she's terrible.  Why is she terrible?  She's talentless.  Why?  She wrote it in like a calligraphy type of font.  It's horribly done.  I can't even read it.  It's not centered.  It's, it's, her lettering stinks.  It's not supposed to be.  Size sucks.  It's not supposed to be centered if you're an artist.  Man.  It should look like that fucking, you know, like needle point, like in fucking the warden's office in Shawshank. 
[00:03:00]  But it's fucking, you can't read the final important word.  No.  It's black.  Capitalized.  Don't go home with nope.  What does that even mean?  Don't go home with nope.  Don't go home with nope.  That's advice to anyone leading with E-Rock.  Looks like it says don't go home with hope.  With hope?  Oh, Jesus.  There's a lot of different variations of the now famous saying don't go home with hope.  It doesn't look like an H at all.  No.  No.  It looks like an M.  It's horrendous.  Don't go home with nope.  That's every letter but an H. She sucks. 
[00:03:30]  That is a weird H.  That is a weird H.  That sign fucking stinks.  It stinks.  Yeah.  Oh, you uncentered piece of shit.  It looks like don't go home with nope.  Bones, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The D is like, the part of the D that's supposed to be bulging is going in a little bit so it  looks like bon't.  Bon't go home with nope.  Bon't go home with nope.  All off center. 
[00:04:00]  She is a fucking asshole.  What?  I'll scald yourself on coffee.  But she's not the biggest asshole, believe it or not.  Believe it or not.  Over the clock we got this sign, don't go home with hope.  Bon't go home with nope.  We got a, I forgot who was sending it.  Someone emailed, Jimmy the Creep I think, sent a professional one.  He mailed it yesterday so we should have that in studio.  Hopefully by tomorrow or Friday. 
[00:04:30]  But then someone else decided to go with the don't go home with hope saying.  Yeah.  And this picture is hanging around everywhere.  It's so famous.  There's three or four in studio alone.  There's some outside the studio.  But the picture itself is very famous.  Yeah, of course.  Of course.  The little kitten holding on.  And it went with the logo, hang in there baby.  If you remember way back when.  And it's the little cat holding on with his little paws.  Right.  And you're supposed to hang in there. 
[00:05:00]  Inspirational.  But yeah, this one is supposed to be the don't go home with hope logo.  Or bon't go home with hope.  Still figuring it out.  But wow.  A little mistype.  Yeah, which messes up the whole fucking thing, by the way.  Yeah.  Because everyone really liked the don't go home with hope phrase or whatever.  Yeah.  This one says don't leave here with hope.  What? 
[00:05:30]  It's not the saying.  That's not the saying.  It's exactly right.  Who came up with this?  That'd be intern Paul.  Paul never fucks up.  Paul as an official fuck up?  Paul never fucks up.  How does he mess up don't go home with hope and turn it into don't leave here with hope?  Wow.  His popularity is dropping like tigers now.  He never screws up.  And he fucked up.  And he was so proud.  He's going to lose my endorsement deal.  Yeah.  He was so proud.  This was hanging everywhere.  Yeah.  He couldn't wait to hang these up. 
[00:06:00]  And for us to see him when we came in here today.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  There you go.  Mope.  She stinks.  Stupid.  She tried to make it all fancy schmancy.  Yeah, yeah.  It's it's.  She thinks it looks fancy.  It's in a frame.  She put it in a frame that is matted.  It's a matted frame.  I know with both go home with Mope in the worst fucking Halloween orange colors. 
[00:06:30]  Can I see that?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not going to break it for real.  It's fucking hilarious.  I do want to see because I can't see.  Take a picture of it.  You got to fucking let people appreciate the awfulness of this retards arts and crafts project.  You feel how fucking cheap this frame is?  It's going to be the cheapest fucking feel is.  Oh, God damn.  What kind of frame is that?  It was probably housing the picture of the fucking foster father that touched her. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, and hold it up so I can tweet this fucker.  Too late, oh.  I know you tweeted it.  All right.  Hold on.  Yeah, OK.  Got it.  Got it.  Don't go home with Mope.  Look out.  Up close, it's even worse.  Dude, look at the hope up close.  What is that word?  What was she doing?  She was trying to do like fancy swirls and like calligraphy. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  But it looks like a lowercase H at the end or an L.  It looks like Mopele.  Both.  Bunker home with Mopele.  Patty stinks.  Oh, Patty, you're a goddamn fool.  She's useless.  Bunker home with Mopele.  This frame is shitty.  Piece of tape on the back of it holding it in.  I just sent out the sign to the Twitterverse. 
[00:08:00]  Terrible.  The Twitterverse?  What is it called?  The Twitter world?  The fucking whatever.  All right.  Hey, so I guess we're doing the Homeless Talent Show.  Yes.  It's believe it or not.  When we last left you people.  Yeah.  They didn't know what was going on.  I mean, we had people running around.  Sam was running around getting us intelligence reports, which is very hard to come by here.  And he comes in and says, well, the fishbowl, which is the big performance area, is booked up. 
[00:08:30]  Well, because of the sweater fashion show.  Sweater fashion show from Cosmo.  With trumpeters.  With trumpeters and a runway and Christmas sweaters for the fashion show.  And apparently the Cardinal has something to do on the other day or time or something.  No.  Wasn't it a tape piece?  But they need a big, huge performance center to run the tape.  To run the tape.  I have no idea why.  Right.  But when we last left you, I guess when Sam spoke to the people in Cosmo, there was no way they could change the date of their event. 
[00:09:00]  Correct.  And somehow, I don't know how, who, what, where, or when, but this has all changed.  Of course it all changed because they realized we were right.  And realized, holy shit, we better run around and get something done here.  So yeah, they did change their sweater fashion show and they're taking it somewhere else. 
[00:09:30]  Well, I want to thank the people from Cosmo for giving up their fishbowl time and letting us do the homeless talent show.  I know, because we need a big space like that because there's going to be listeners involved.  That's right.  They're coming in for the first time since we were at the old studio.  We're actually going to have a live audience. 
[00:10:00]  Well, we're going to have 12 listeners.  No, we've got to have more than 12.  No, we're going to have 12 and they can bring a guest.  So, oh, it's going to be 24 total people.  Oh, there's the maximum for that.  I don't know if I like the idea of, and bring a guest.  I don't like that either.  Some people can.  I like individuals.  Yeah, but they'll work fucked up.  They'll work together.  Yeah.  24 people.  Yeah.  I think we could fit twice as much as that in there. 
[00:10:30]  That studio is bigger than where we used to broadcast and we used to have a hundred easy.  There's, you know, I guess capacity rules we must adhere to.  But look, I said what I had to say yesterday.  So, this is wonderful.  24 people will be watching our broadcast.  24 people who we can then interact with again and like we did at the old studio.  I'm picturing fun, fun, fun.  Space is limited.  24 people total and winners will be chosen on the first emails received. 
[00:11:00]  Uh-oh.  Oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  Each winner may bring one guest.  So, the first 12 emails to this email address.  Wait, what?  Wait, what?  But what if now that they, what if they don't, what if they RSVP but don't show up?  Like, we need some backups.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't we want to have people just outside and then, you know, say, hey, you can come in. 
[00:11:30]  Hand pick some people that would be interesting.  And what if we want to bring people up.  By the way.  Everyone relax.  Everyone take a deep breath.  What if we want to bring people up for, say, a half hour and then rotate because they have to leave.  People have to go to work.  Sometimes they don't come for the entire time.  That is true.  They might be able to come for 20 minutes or a half hour.  What about guests that we want to have in there anyway?  Like the likes of, you know, Stupid Patty, Big A, things like that. 
[00:12:00]  What is this?  Oh, my God.  Have you ever seen what you just heard?  Do not give out the email address because then we're fucked.  That's the solicitation info that I was provided with.  Look, I know the guys are trying down the hall.  But honestly, this is my real issue.  We can do way better than this.  We really can.  Yes. 
[00:12:30]  Because it's not just inviting the first 12 to email.  We have, like, special, like, fans and people that we would want to invite up because they would actually help the broadcast.  And if there's some nut that wants to come in, we would love to have him.  And you have to have a rotating thing because people really very...  Some can stay for the whole time.  A lot can't because of work.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And some people, they want to come in for a little while and then go, you know what? 
[00:13:00]  I want to go home.  Exactly.  They'll take some time, walk around the city a little bit, and then come here and show up and, you know.  Yeah.  We have to be a little less rigid with it.  Of course.  Rigid.  This thing has...  This smells like a lawyer.  This is like a legal disclaimer.  I'm not reading this.  I'll read it.  No, don't read it.  I just won't read the...  Because if you read the email address, you're fucked.  I won't read the email.  Steve, you wish to bring this microphone here. 
[00:13:30]  What, Steve?  You guys will have final say on whoever comes in as long as, you know, as long as you can  peruse that beforehand.  I sent them all a long list after I got this, which they never responded to.  So I'll make sure you guys get final say on who comes in.  But also, it should be...  We should be able to rotate a little bit.  Again, because people have to come and go.  Sure.  Some people will just have to leave.  They'll have things to do.  Places to go.  People to see.  Events to attend.  Friends to visit.  This is all just the ridiculous security protocols that have to go on because of this building 
[00:14:00]  that we're in.  Everyone's got to have an ID.  Everyone's got to get signed in.  Everybody's got to get put into the system.  Everyone's got to get checked.  Oh, cool, boy.  The 92.3 is doing a great job in the morning off the subject.  Oh, I know, yeah.  All right.  Oh, boy.  Oh, we can talk about that in a second.  Great idea.  Good job, guys.  Our old station just hired Mariah Carey's husband to do mornings.  Good job.  And, well, it's Nick Cannon, who's one of the people that does America's Got Talent. 
[00:14:30]  But the problem is, Nick Cannon has many jobs already.  And he goes, well, I'll just add another full-time job to my work day.  Go ahead.  Have fun.  And Nick Cannon thinks he could do it.  These guys don't understand how hard radio is to do, especially celebrities.  They think it's a fucking piece of cake.  Most celebrities just fail miserably at doing radio because they don't have the work ethic  that it takes to do a radio show.  And I don't blame Nick Cannon for thinking he could do it.  That's true.  I blame, once again, management, not here, of another company. 
[00:15:00]  They know this shit doesn't work.  They've seen it before.  The celebrity radio thing, it really doesn't work very well.  They're fucking terrible.  It just doesn't work, and they should understand that by now, especially them, because they  did the David Lee Roth experiment.  So now Nick Cannon's going to be doing mornings.  I mean, the article in the paper is like, I won't be able to sleep.  I'll just be taking power naps.  How long will that possibly make for good radio? 
[00:15:30]  How long will that work before it's just a complete disaster?  And why didn't they have him come in for the fugitive thing?  That would be a great kickoff for him.  Right.  Well, that would mean he would have to work.  Yes, of course.  It's a horrendous move.  It really is.  It really is.  Whenever he gets fired, it's always just the talent.  Never the fucking guy has to make the decision.  They should just find whoever is really good at doing that type of radio and put them in mornings. 
[00:16:00]  An actual radio guy.  Enough with celebrities doing radio shows.  It just doesn't work.  They don't have the work ethic.  This is a fucking tough fucking life.  What do you think they do?  I know you have a tougher life out there.  I'm not trying to say that.  But this is a lot harder than people realize.  What do you think they're paying them?  Oh, wow.  I mean, seven figures.  Easy.  Easy.  Easy.  Oh, it's a fucking...  And no one's head will roll over this when it fails miserably. 
[00:16:30]  Nope.  He's married to Mariah Carey.  When it fails miserably.  He's going to, what, not spend time with his wife, Mariah Carey, to put in the time to get a good radio show together?  They'll voice track a lot of stuff, I bet.  Yeah, fine.  The listeners are going to know that, though.  Yeah.  They're not stupid.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  But that's not the worst move in radio yesterday.  Oh, my God.  There's even a worse move than that that happened yesterday.  Citadel, who's officially, I guess they officially filed for bankruptcy. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, they did.  Which means our stock certificate is now worth just pennies.  The $100,000 investment Ant and I each did, each, that means $100,000 each, is now worth basically pennies.  I got some value out of it.  You sold?  No, no.  I ran out of toilet paper.  And it was right near me in the bathroom, so I just wiped my fucking ass with it.  Citadel filed for bankruptcy and they made a programming change. 
[00:17:30]  Yes, they did.  They hired a guy to be the vice president of programming for the entire company.  Wow.  That's important.  It has to be at least 100 radio stations.  Boy, let me tell you.  They hired Scott Shannon to be the fucking vice president of programming.  We've played his audio from his New York show on this fine radio show of ours.  There it is.  The guy. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, I'd love to hear the meeting between him and Fareed.  That must have been a nice little chit chat.  What is he going to do programming-wise for Citadel Broadcasting?  He's fairly involved in his own radio show.  It says Scott's contributions to radio are legendary.  They are legendary.  I'll give him that.  And his successes are many.  He has a proven resource for us.  The best music programmer in the industry today.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, they've got accolades, accolades, accolades. 
[00:18:30]  Shannon, a long-time broadcaster.  Host shows all over the place.  We'll work with Citadel's major market programmers on overall programming and content direction.  Good luck to you.  Have fun with the stock certificate and the shitter and the company filing for bankruptcy.  I want to hear more of his audio.  Oh, yeah.  Let me say, I accept this job with such a fool.  All his teeth fly out of his head. 
[00:19:00]  Speak fake teeth.  All right.  Please, can we hear more of his audio?  Can't they just grab a minute for me?  Just send it down the hall.  Just say it.  They're listening to you in the office.  Guys, please.  Just go, Sam.  Please get me some Scott Shannon audio.  He'll be on it.  Pronto.  Sam or Iraq.  Fuck.  Yeah, we'll have some Scott Shannon.  We'll show you how great he is and that he's worthy of this amazing position that Free just gave him.  Program a bankrupt company.  What an honor.  And then our pal. 
[00:19:30]  So what are we doing with the 12 listener thing?  Well, it's 24 listeners.  I don't want this to really sound silly.  No, it's 12 listeners.  But it's going to be 24 in there.  Right.  It's 12 winners.  12 plus one.  Right.  Like, well, 12 each plus one.  Right.  We've never done a radio show for 24 people.  I mean, I don't mind that because it's like a physically limiting space.  But the problem is, again, you need more than enough people because... 
[00:20:00]  Because we want to...  I mean, I want to blow it out.  Like, change the rules and have people outside the fishbowl.  Is that crazy?  We'd never allow that.  There's another freaking entrance to this place on the other side.  We would never allow it.  Never.  Safety issues.  My God.  Are you insane?  People standing?  Yeah, they can put chairs out there.  Someone's knee could give.  A chair?  What if a leg breaks on a chair?  You're liable, my friend.  Oh. 
[00:20:30]  Yes.  I stand corrected.  So we'll figure that out.  But I do think we should...  Wow.  We've got to get people quick.  12, 12, you know...  That could take...  12 emails?  That could take a half a second.  Damn.  We've got to get also a bunch of homeless folks.  Yeah.  For their talent show?  Yes, we do.  Because without the homeless, it's just us in the fishbowl with our listeners.  But I have no doubts that with the promise of cold, hard cash, that the homeless will show. 
[00:21:00]  To show off their talent.  Can I say this, though?  Sure can, Jimmy.  Let's just say that the homeless come and we do the talent show.  We also say we have other prizes for them if we want to.  Certainly.  Is there a way, if we decide to, impromptu...  Uh-oh.  Say we find some listeners...  Yeah.  ...who happen to come, and we realize that they, too, have a gift...  Certain talent? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Perhaps to do a secondary portion of it.  If we find that the talent pool...  Right, is a little shallow.  ...in the homeless...  In the homeless...  Exactly.  I was thinking more of a fucking riverbed...  Infected?  Yeah.  But let's say that a homeless thing runs its course by a certain time...  Yes.  Well, and the poor sponsor may feel like they've just, you know...  Missed out.  Yeah.  On a big opportunity.  I am totally game for getting the listeners involved. 
[00:22:00]  Even when we just hand them microphones, it's always been magic and gold, Jim.  It really has.  You know that.  What happened?  Fantastic.  I'll figure it out as the day goes on.  I want to get this out of the way right away.  I've got to say hi to my buddy, Deco Bill.  Deco Bill?  Deco Bill.  He sounds like a real creep.  Deco Bill.  How could Deco Bill be a creep when he has sent me more Nazi memorabilia than I've ever seen in my life?  Oh, good point. 
[00:22:30]  Wow.  Just pins and magazines and books and a giant stamp collection.  Thank you, Deco Bill.  Wow.  This is genuine stuff.  Yeah.  Look at this.  Hitler for Bayer.  What a weird button.  There's all kinds of stuff.  Pin some on your lapel and walk around.  Now, I understand that Nazi was an amazing era and all that, but they're just such, you know, terrible people. 
[00:23:00]  Well, no one's denying the fact that they were awful people, I must say.  Let me see this.  I mean, some of that stuff is cool from a historical point of view.  I watched last night, just for the hell of it, the 1936 Nuremberg documentary called Triumph of the Will.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  How, in a few short years, it went from that to, well, putting a bullet in your head in the bunker.  All I kept thinking was somebody was going to peek in my window and watch me watching black and white Hitler footage. 
[00:23:30]  Weeping.  I'm sure they can hear it down the block.  You fucking...  You know what I watched recently, historically, which is not a Nazi thing, but I'm reading the book.  After Jesse and I talk, I mean, I started rereading Vincent Bugliosi's book about the JFK assassination.  It wasn't an assassin.  All right.  The book is so good, dude.  Yeah.  We interviewed him about that.  I forgot.  We were on KROQ.  We interviewed him about that.  Yeah, we sure did.  I watched JFK's inaugural speech in 1961, the one where he makes the famous, ask not what 
[00:24:00]  your country could do for you, what you could do for your country.  Ask not.  Not.  What a...  You forget what a great speaker he could be.  We always think of, like, Martin Luther King and, you know, all these other guys as being  an amazing speaker.  He was a fucking great speaker, man.  Yeah.  People loved him.  God damn, was JFK.  I'm very passionate with what he said.  We will put a man on the moon by the end of the decad.  He didn't say that in that speech.  I know.  Civility is not a weakness.  I was like, God, that was a great...  What a great fucking thing to say. 
[00:24:30]  But he was a guy who was...  A human skull is a weakness.  Yes.  Yeah, that is true.  A human skull.  Yes.  A head with a doggy door.  That's a weakness.  Yes.  Yes.  Terrible.  A head that opens like a little puppeteer's box is a weakness.  It's got a little...  A Jack...  A Jack Kennedy in the box.  You twirl the little handle in my ear and the top of my head pops off.  Yes.  When you sneeze and your head falls over the way two condoms do when they're attached. 
[00:25:00]  But, uh...  What a great speech, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was really fucking good.  He was the man.  You know what channel I'm really getting addicted to now?  God damn Smithsonian.  Oh.  Have you seen Smithsonian HD Channel?  They got a Smithsonian channel.  Yes, they do.  And it's some of the best history crap ever.  It's all, like, from Smithsonian archives and everything like that.  The museum in Washington sucks. 
[00:25:30]  It could be so much better than it is.  Apparently, all the good stuff is still, like, tucked away.  They're too scared to display it or something.  I think the air and space one.  A lot of the museums in Washington are great, but the Smithsonian was a big disappointment  when I saw it.  Last night, they had...  Archie Bunker's chair.  Yeah.  Great.  I did like that in the mash tent, though.  I was like, those are pretty cool.  I sat in the chairs, filled coffee on it.  Actually, I didn't mind it.  I'm just saying.  But I don't even remember half the stuff, because it was like, who cares?  Who cares stuff?  Yeah.  Last night, Men Who Brought the Dawn. 
[00:26:00]  And it was the story of delivering the two atom bombs to Nagasaki and Hiroshima.  Oh, my God.  With, like, film clips I've never seen before, interviews with Tibbetts and the bombardier  and the communications engineer and everything that happened.  Well, obviously, we know what happened, but all the ins and outs of them finally dropping  it and turning around.  Like, Tibbetts is just such an old fucking military guy.  He's talking.  He goes, I know we were up to about 160 miles an hour on the runway, and we take off at 
[00:26:30]  140, but we had such a big load, and the co-pilot started pulling back on the yoke.  I turn around and go, God damn, let go of that thing.  I'm flying this plane.  Just a man's man.  Just a crotchety old fuck that killed hundreds of thousands of Japanese.  The people who say that we could have not dropped that because the Japanese were ready  to surrender, and that was more to show the Soviets what we had and that we were willing  to use it.  Exactly.  I'll be talking about that, too.  They stick to it. 
[00:27:00]  I mean, the people on the Enola Gay and Boxcar, they stick to the fact, or their opinion,  and a lot of people's opinion, that dropping the two bombs on Japan saved more Japanese  than an invasion would have.  Oh, of course.  And more people were killed in the fire bombings of Japan than were killed by both atom bombs.  Couldn't they just drop one, though?  After they dropped one, the motherfuckers weren't surrendering.  Oh, okay.  So it's like, hey, guys, they weren't even acknowledging the fucking thing. 
[00:27:30]  So you dropped two, and then they were like, and there was a third one, and it was on its  way over to a fucking base to be dropped when the surrender came through.  And they turned around at the California coast, put it back in storage.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, they were ready to fucking drop it.  Where's that bomb now?  I'm going to find out.  Shut up.  He's going to be looking through the windows.  Is that show tonight?  I don't know, man.  Wednesday night, 10 o'clock.  Wednesday is a busy, busy night.  So we'll have audio of that show tomorrow. 
[00:28:00]  It's our new favorite bit.  Tomorrow he talks about, what's the subject of the show tomorrow?  No, tonight.  Oh, tonight, I'm sorry.  Did he do 9-11 yet?  9-11 was last week.  How was that?  Oh, this one is global warming.  Is it a hoax?  Cool.  Yeah, so we're going to talk about that.  It'll be good.  How was the 9-11 one?  It was good.  It was about two hours.  It was pure Jesse Ventura psychobabble about thermite paint and all the other stuff. 
[00:28:30]  He goes to, I'll quickly tell you this.  We went over it, but you've got to hear this.  He goes to JFK Airport, where apparently in one of the hangars, they store metal from the trade  center.  And he calls his camera crew, come here, come here, I see it.  And he's looking through a window on a door in a hangar at JFK going, there's what they  don't want me to see.  It's right through the window.  You're seeing it.  It's metal.  He goes, if we could only test that dust for thermite.  And then he twists the knob and goes, well, the door's locked. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, a locked door at JFK.  Holy shit, Jesse.  You're turning the world on its ear.  It's an ass.  You wanted to test it for thermite dust?  Thermite dust.  Because it was exploding.  But wait, you act like nobody had access to the trade center.  I went, I walked down there.  The biggest crime scene that was cleaned up so quickly.  Giuliani was proud of how many tons went out.  Yeah, they had to clean up fucking the lower half of Manhattan, idiot. 
[00:29:30]  If you're trying to hide a crime scene, you don't collapse the buildings in the middle  of the city.  Exactly.  It's silly.  He was pissed at how quickly they got away.  And then they show him down at Ground Zero, now, going, I was hoping to find a piece of  metal that we could have run tests on.  Eight years later, you dummy.  There's new buildings there.  Wouldn't the rain have washed it off?  Dude, we did all this last week.  Idiot.  We did all these points last week.  And where were you in 2001, maybe? 
[00:30:00]  We did that last week, too.  Where were you?  We did this whole bit.  Where was he?  Yeah, it was ridiculous.  Fantastic, though.  We did two hours.  We killed him last week.  I strongly recommend you find it and watch it and chuckle along with Jesse.  Find it.  It's online.  It's on YouTube.  It's everywhere.  But, yeah, we did it.  I mean, we can't wait to see the global warming one tonight.  Super thermite.  That's what he called it.  And we'll be all over that tomorrow, certainly.  Hey, why don't we take our first break?  Because we have about 14 live reads today.  Wow.  So we have to, like, I think we have to break more than usual to squeeze them in. 
[00:30:30]  Let me just explain to the listener, though.  Now, don't tune away.  No, of course not.  For the live reads, because we try to make them very interesting and fun.  You won't even know it's a read.  And we got stuff we give away during the commercial breaks now.  Oh, it's amazing.  We just pop in and talk about our whores.  Things like that.  So don't you go anywhere during these.  Speaking of whores, your Tiger Woods update after the break.  Amazing.  One, two, three, four, five.  We have six to go through today. 
[00:31:00]  Six events that have changed over.  Six new events since yesterday.  Fantastic.  By the way, before we break, I found the best way to annoy your girlfriend.  All right.  Well, you're going to tell us after the break.  Okay.  Opie and Anthony.  We'll be right back. 
[00:31:30]  Opie and Anthony, we've got a busy show.  We've got MVP for the WWE coming in in a few minutes.  I guess he's doing a tribute to the troops.  That's very, very solid, man.  WWE is doing a whole tribute to the troops.  And MVP is one of the participants. 
[00:32:00]  And it's going to be this Saturday, 9 p.m. on NBC.  NBC?  Got the WWE?  That's pretty fucking cool.  Well, Jimmy, I'm sorry.  It's from Iraq, I think.  Yeah, yeah.  So we'll talk to him about that.  And then we've got our old friend, Victoria Zedrock.  Z-D-R-O-K.  The sexpert.  Yeah, she has a very sexy porn tape out.  Really?  What?  Really?  Yeah.  Porn tape?  She kind of hosts it where it's like a guide to sex and stuff. 
[00:32:30]  But she does, I believe it's a lesbian scene at the end.  And she's a fucking dirty one, man.  Oh, yeah.  What the hell's her name again?  Victoria Zedrock.  She flops out.  Is that Dr. Z?  Yeah, Dr. Z.  She flops out her tits when she comes in here.  They're fucking fantastic.  Dr. Z.  Yeah.  She was willing to put a strap on and bang Patrice up the ass.  All right.  Patrice is like, go fuck yourself.  I ain't doing that.  I remember that.  But, well, Patrice kind of...  But she had the whole strap-on on.  Patrice made it sound like he wanted to have it done. 
[00:33:00]  I lied.  And then he lied.  Oh, yeah.  That was the famous line.  She's all ready.  And he goes, I lied.  Hey, Scott and Todd, you asked for the audio, Jimmy.  We got the audio.  So, a lot of news in the radio world.  Two big stories.  Yes, giant.  Nick Cannon, who's Mariah Carey's husband, will be doing mornings at our old joint,  nine, two, three, now, whatever it's called.  Great job.  I think it's a lame move. 
[00:33:30]  I think they've got to wake up.  Celebrities don't know how to do radio shows.  They're not going to wake up, does it?  I would love to get a list together of celebrities that have done radio shows and have failed miserably.  Whoopi's a huge one.  Oh, my God, right?  She didn't last.  Not at all.  Ugh.  David Lee Roth.  David Lee Roth didn't last.  There's a bunch of them, too.  I think we could get a little list together.  Yeah, and they know that over there because, you know, this radio thing, it's hard work.  And someone like Nick Cannon, they're interviewing him in the paper, and he's like, well, I got 
[00:34:00]  a lot of full-time jobs already.  I'll just, this is just another full-time job.  I guess I just won't sleep.  Yeah, people seem to.  How's that going to work in the end?  Have the misconception that you just kind of, you know, come in and wing it.  Oh, wait a minute.  No, somebody like him is going to start coming in, realize it's early in the morning, it  sucks, and not be able to handle the hours.  Right.  Yeah.  I mean, celebrities in general are lazy.  RuPaul?  They don't want, RuPaul.  Wow.  They don't want to, they don't want to, like, freaking put in the time. 
[00:34:30]  You know?  Did Alec Baldwin do radio?  What?  No.  Is Alec Baldwin totally bombed?  Doing radio?  I don't know, maybe, was he on one of those liberal fucking, Al Franken?  That whole fucking, that whole thing.  Janine Garofalo?  That's right.  Wow, yeah.  On that lib radio?  Mm-hmm.  Our America?  Our America.  Yeah.  Alice Cooper?  Alice Cooper did radio?  That's what I'm just reading things.  No, Wendy Williams was the other way. 
[00:35:00]  She did radio and does a show, and apparently it's pretty successful.  That stupid fucking man show of hers.  God damn.  Who knew?  And the other, the other thing that happened in radio yesterday, Scott Shannon, who is  a legend in this business, and we should respect him a little bit.  He's an older gentleman now, though.  Yes, yes.  And his creative years are way past him.  Way past him.  A little in his wake.  So that's why I'm a bit surprised that Citadel Broadcasting decided to make Scott Shannon 
[00:35:30]  the vice president of programming for all their properties, all their radio stations.  You're surprised a bankrupt company made a silly move?  Why?  Extremely surprised they would do that.  Instead of getting some young programmer to take over the company, they went with Scott  Shannon, who hasn't done anything creative in probably a decade.  It's been a while.  Doesn't he program PLJ, though?  Yeah.  Which is actually doing very well.  They probably thought we have nothing else going.  What does that entail? 
[00:36:00]  Programming PLJ?  Oh, there's lots of things.  For real.  I don't know.  You know, there's nothing there.  It's just basic shit.  It's just basic shit.  No.  You just play the hits.  So Jimmy requested some Scott and Todd audio.  So this is a break they did 15, 20 minutes ago.  Another breach of security publicized from the White House is a couple from Georgia were  there for a White House tour. 
[00:36:30]  And before they knew it, they were sitting at breakfast with Barack Obama and his wife.  In the private dining room?  Yeah.  It left the White House again explaining how people who were not on the event guest list  wound up.  Guest list.  You might need to make a change over there.  Something's wrong.  Yeah.  It's starting to scare me.  Yeah, make a change.  The improbable adventure of Harvey and Paula Darden from Hogansville, Georgia happened on 
[00:37:00]  Veterans Day two weeks before the Salami family.  We're not on the list, you know.  That's all right.  The White House and the Secret Service both said they went through appropriate security  screenings, were allowed into the breakfast as a courtesy because there were no public  tours that day.  Oh.  However, that explanation was news to Mr. Darden.  Harvey is a retired pharmacist, said they were never told about a breakfast.  They thought they were simply starting their tour, which was arranged through the congressman. 
[00:37:30]  And they were ushered into the East Room, told they'd be meeting with the president.  Wow.  A big breakfast there.  They met with the president?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Harvey and Paula out of Hogansville.  So it wasn't really a breach because they were told that they were going to be.  Oh, yeah.  They didn't do it on purpose.  Are you listening?  I'm just saying.  They approached the White House aide and said, you know, we're not supposed to be at the  breakfast with the president.  The guy said, just go with the flow, will you? 
[00:38:00]  I told him, just go with the flow.  Nice.  Don't worry about it.  I wonder if I, now, is that a breach or did Obama say just want to do something weird  like get a couple of citizens and have breakfast with him?  All right, Jimmy, hold on for a second.  Yeah, who cares, Jimmy?  We got to talk about how uncomfortable that was.  You know what?  The clip was being played because it was Scott Shannon.  Jesus, Jimmy.  What the fuck's wrong with you?  I don't know.  But I have to defend Jimmy on something. 
[00:38:30]  Why the fuck would you pick an interesting story?  Because that, I've got to tell you, it's kind of an interesting story.  Of course it's an interesting story.  I was dying to hear what was next.  Yes.  It's an interesting story, but it was very uncomfortable to listen to.  Right.  I've got a very uncomfortable feeling listening to that.  There's no energy behind what they're saying.  That's the story of the day.  And so to read it, for a morning show to read it as if they're news readers, you just  turn on the CW for that.  Here's the problem, though.  When we play clips of news people, they're like, and two people were in the White House 
[00:39:00]  that don't belong there.  Sure.  It's boring and dull anyway.  Right.  So that, to me, could have been any boring and dull, like, news station, just to go like,  if we ever went, hey, there's a story about, you know, a couple in the White House, let's  go to the clip.  It would have sounded just like that.  Exactly.  So that wasn't a good example.  No, I submit to you, that was not a good example of Scott Shannon, because the story  was too interesting, and it took away from really listening to how badly he trips over  his choppers.  But here's why it is a good example. 
[00:39:30]  We put it into the context of, they're supposed to be doing what this show does, meaning add  the pizzazz to the clip, not just do the clip.  But you don't know that.  No one knows that listening.  They probably, if someone just tuned in, they wouldn't go, they wouldn't have gone,  oh, wow, they're goofing on Scott Shannon or some other radio show or something.  They would go, oh, here's a story about the White House.  Yeah.  You fucked up.  Should we get another clip?  You fucked up.  You fucked up.  You fucked up.  Yes.  Oh, I wanted to do more. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, Jimmy.  I hate, I got to.  It's the worst when I wanted to keep the chant going and none of the guys did.  I know.  Don't you hate being the last guy chanting?  The worst, especially when you're four hours later, you realize everyone's gone home and you're  still chanting.  Well, you want another clip, Anne, or what?  You want more Scott?  Yes.  I want Scott with a story that isn't, like, compelling.  Yes.  Please.  It's kind of a compelling story.  I wasn't compelled.  Thank you.  I wanted to know what happened.  You weren't compelled.  The energy was really weak.  But like I said, did you hear Todd's jokes?  Play that AP guy. 
[00:40:30]  And today, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  No, I understand that.  Blah, blah, blah.  I understand that.  But I think the listeners understand they were listening to a morning show that should be all  peppy and energetic and I don't know.  And some kind of chemistry going back and forth.  Hey, that's the one thing we do have is energy.  I don't know how.  Peppy and bursting with love.  That's the one thing this show always will have is the energy.  Are we back in five minutes with a boring story?  Please do.  Thank you.  We're happy and peppy and bursting with love.  Happy and peppy.  Like a little pup.  We go down at that park. 
[00:41:00]  Like a little pup.  Happy and peppy and bursting with love.  A terrible song.  You want to do Tiger Woods or do you want to do a story about our old friend Barry Williams?  I'd rather do that Barry Williams.  Barry Williams.  That's a great one.  Barry Williams is our old pal.  Maybe we could get him on the phone.  I still have his number, I think.  Does he still have a station here or no?  Should I show?  I think he was on the 70s channel for a while.  I don't know.  I haven't heard him on there in a while.  I check out the 70s channel.  He was hiding from his chick. 
[00:41:30]  He was chasing him by the fucking medieval mace.  When I went and saw him in L.A., he was married to some kind of international investor,  investor, banker, investing, I don't know.  Import, export.  Yeah, some kind of international banker.  Let's just put it that way.  You had leftovers with him.  That's right.  No, he had a brand new meal.  I had the leftovers.  You had leftovers.  Yes, that is a true story.  But he was married.  He had a kid.  And that went horribly wrong. 
[00:42:00]  I don't know what happened there.  And now he's dating again.  And Barry Williams just filed a restraining order against his chick or his ex-chick.  What?  Not his wife, his ex-wife, his ex-chick after the wife left.  So the wife left, he starts dating.  Yeah.  And then things get so out of control, he's got to file a restraining order against the  chick.  Yeah.  What happened?  Well, we're going to find out right now.  Oh.  How about Greg Brady?  It's a story about restraining orders. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, my God.  Who thought that Barry Williams would end up in the news today?  But he actually has a restraining order against his girlfriend who he claims has been violent  to him in the past.  He claims that she pulled a knife on him in August and almost tried to stab him and he  had to restrain her.  And he's saying he's breaking up with her and he knows she's going to flip out.  And he was granted a restraining order of 100 yards.  So he wants nothing to do with her or her knives.  Or her knives.  It's funny how like a girl chased the guy with a knife and they joke about it, but yet 
[00:43:00]  the fucking Snooki clip, if you joked about it, they'd say it's insensitive because it  has to be violence.  Well, on the way around.  By the way, she freaked out about a beauty contest that she didn't win.  And I'm looking at her, it's like, who'd she lose to?  Mr. Ed?  What a fucking long face.  She's not the most attractive.  She shouldn't be doing beauty contests.  She's not.  She's fuckable, but it's like, come on.  Yeah, for Greg, I can't see her body, though, in that shot.  Well.  Big toothy gal.  Poor Greg.  She's alright.  He's in hell.  The restraining order is because she's not groovy. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  No, she came in and she caught him smoking.  Yes, yes.  In his little bearded room.  Big trouble.  What's going on with his hair?  He's got like cotton candy hair.  It's like each follicle seems to have a one inch around it.  His follicles like breathing room, it seems.  He's, uh, same thing he had to do against the fucking, the TV Mr. Brady.  Final restraining order.  See, apparently his hair looks like it's covering his entire head, yet the forest is very sparse. 
[00:44:00]  It sure is, Anthony.  It sure is.  A lot of, uh, a lot of sunbeams hitting the skull.  Yeah, yeah.  So she didn't win.  Okay, there's a little body shot.  Let's take a look.  She's all right.  Yeah, she's all right.  Yeah, she's got a fucking Sarah Jessica Parker chin going on there.  She does, yeah.  She didn't win a beauty contest, so she goes after him with a knife?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Well, apparently it was...  WTF.  Apparently it was like, um, she wanted the $10 Monopoly card that she won the beauty contest, 
[00:44:30]  and she didn't get it.  So her fucking face is shaped like the Monopoly iron.  Jesus.  Salvage that one.  All right.  Well, so that's going on today.  Maybe we can get Barry on the phone to discuss it further.  I doubt it.  He wouldn't be able to.  Why not?  It's a restraining order.  Usually, you know, lawyers get involved and say you can't talk about shit like that.  Is MVP here?  Who?  Is that MVP?  Let's get him in. 
[00:45:00]  Let's get this over with.  I mean, let's talk to MVP.  Yeah, I think he is here.  Is that him coming down the hall?  I don't know.  And then we'll do...  All right, then we'll do the Tiger Woods update after we have MVP in studio, okay?  What are these people?  An MVP?  Who are these people?  That's MVP.  I have no idea.  That's E-Rock.  Yeah.  With his horrendous haircut.  It really is awful.  What is he doing?  MVP and F-A-T. 
[00:45:30]  MWP, most worthless person.  E-Rock.  Bring him in.  Yeah.  Bring him right in.  I want E-Rock in here.  Here we go.  How you doing, E-Rock?  What's up, MVP?  How you been, man?  Oh, man, exceptional.  Very good, huh?  Hi.  How you doing, man?  Can I see you all around?  Doing all right?  What's up, brother?  No, it's inconvenient, but...  Yeah, yeah.  Long extended hands.  Yeah, yeah.  The studio isn't conducive to shaking hands, apparently. 
[00:46:00]  Now, you want an E-Rock in here?  Well, we never really want...  I don't want to just look at his haircut.  What's wrong with that?  It's a cool look if you're fucking doing a...  You're like the rich kid in a fucking 80s movie.  That's good.  That is pretty good.  It's awful fucking good.  Yeah.  Hi, Sam.  Oh, good.  Scott and Todd talk about an overdue library book.  See, this is the type of clip we need, Sam.  Now, that's the type of thing we're looking for.  Perfect.  Are you going to Iraq?  Just got back from Iraq.  Oh, you came back from Iraq.  Yeah, it's done, Jimmy. 
[00:46:30]  Now they've got to show it on TV.  It's Saturday.  Why don't they show it live?  Or is it just the time difference?  It's crazy.  It's like...  Yeah, you've got to cut it up.  It's an hour time difference.  You've been there?  Editing.  Yeah, you've got to cut it up and make it look good, right?  Make it into a show.  Turn it into something.  Okay.  So where were you guys in Iraq?  We were at the Balad Air Force Base.  That was where we were based.  And then from there, they split us up into groups.  And we went to a few different forward operating bases.  My group went to Al-Assad Base, which I think is primarily a Marine base. 
[00:47:00]  How did you get there?  A C-130 cargo jet.  I mean, like, how did you get from base to base?  C-130.  Oh, C-130?  Oh, okay.  That's all I took when I was in country, as we say.  In country, yes.  I didn't take any...  Did you take any Blackhawks?  I didn't take any helicopters.  It was all C-130s.  This time, we didn't.  I think some of the other guys may have.  But I didn't fly on any Blackhawks this particular trip.  When you took off, did you notice that they put guys in the back of the planes?  And there's two...  There's, like, windows.  When you take off, there's, like, these guys looking out your windows. 
[00:47:30]  And when you ask them what they're doing, they're like, that's to make sure that nothing...  Yeah, no incoming.  Yeah.  Nothing's firing at you.  Wow.  Very comforting.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's good.  First time in Iraq?  Yes, it was a...  Excuse me.  What was your first impression?  Uh...  But, yeah, you know, it's funny, because when we got there, they, uh, uh, one of the colonels  or majors, or I forget who, but he was basically telling us that at that particular base, on  occasion, you know, they get mortar attacks.  You know, they hadn't had any in a few days, so we should be all right. 
[00:48:00]  And I'm laughing to myself, like, yeah, we hadn't had any days.  We should be all right.  Mortar attacks, you know, on base.  Sure.  But, I think my, uh, the thing that got me the most, man, was just how appreciative,  you know, the troops over there are, because they don't get anything.  I mean, periodically, you know, you get comedians, and, you know, we go over there and visit  them, but just to be so far from home, and just, they were so, uh, so appreciative, just  the gratitude, over and over, man, thanks for coming out, everybody, from privates to generals,  everybody was very thankful for us coming out. 
[00:48:30]  And they're all polite, they're all, they really are the best audiences, man, they really  are so happy you showed up.  Well, did you hear this?  Now, this is, this got me, I thought, this is kind of bizarre.  One thing I kept hearing is that how cool it was to be normal, or around normal people.  Did anybody say that to you?  Uh-uh.  Well, that's, that's what I was saying.  I've never heard of that.  I was wondering, because, oh, man, it's just so nice to be normal, to be around normal people.  I said, if you think we're normal, you guys have actually lost it.  Yeah, you've been here a little too long.  You've been here too long.  It's probably because you're around guys, you know, it's all military there, it's all aggressive, 
[00:49:00]  and we didn't go to any forward bases, though.  We went to, we tried to go in a blog, we couldn't land because of the fog, but those forward  bases, man, you're in the middle of nowhere.  Man, you know, it's funny, because I was talking to one guy, and, you know, last time I was  here, I talked to you guys about my past, my, you know.  And I was talking to a few Marines, and I said, guys, you know, this, I can't exactly relate,  but to an extent, as I'm looking around, and I see, you know, razor wire and guard towers,  and, you know, you guys are in uniform, and you've got, you know, certain times you've got to eat, 
[00:49:30]  and, you know, this is kind of like being in prison, right?  Yeah.  It kind of sucks.  Well, no, I mean, it sucks, but just to say, I was just like, man,  and for as far as you can see, man, it's just dirt and sand.  Nothingness.  Nothing, man.  Nothing.  I think it sucks that they're in a country where, you know, because of the respect of the religious beliefs,  they can't have a fucking beer or something.  You know, you watch good old NAMM footage and shit, and the guys are sitting at their firebases,  just, you know, getting a little fucking buzz on, having some fun, smoking a little weed. 
[00:50:00]  We see how that worked out in the end.  Well, yeah, that worked out real well.  At least if it's going to go that way, at least be able to drink.  I got a kick out of the fact in the chow hall they had non-alcoholic beer.  Really?  Now, what's the point?  Oh, really?  Yeah, because beer doesn't taste good.  Maybe if you make some alcohol and dump it in there, stir it up a little bit.  I'm sure they could make all kinds of things that would work.  I got a kick out of the fact.  I went to the PX, and we were originally supposed to go to Afghanistan, 
[00:50:30]  but they said it was, you know, a little too hot there now,  so they kept us in Iraq.  And I went to the PX, and they had a jewelry store that had all, like,  the cheap flea market bling.  And one of them, there was a marijuana leaf all blinged out with glass or whatever it was.  And I was surprised by that, and I asked the captain who was escorting me.  I was like, man, are you guys allowed to have that here?  And some random civilian guy said, oh, man, you should go to Afghanistan, man. 
[00:51:00]  They got this everywhere, man.  It just grows.  It's all over the place.  It's great.  Hmm.  Uh, you know, it was bittersweet because, like, now, you know, with our drug testing policy,  if you test positive for marijuana, it's a $2,500 fine.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  They're pretty stringent.  You could pay that, though.  Yeah.  That's easy, I'm thinking, for some of these guys.  When you stack them up, though, after a while, it's just going to be kind of redundant.  Sure.  All right.  I have a question about, I have a jail attitude question. 
[00:51:30]  How do you know when you're in, I've always wondered this, when you have to fight a guy?  Like, when, like, what is the moment, you know, like, ugh, I just watched a show on this,  this movie on this guy called Bronson, who's a British prisoner.  I don't know if you've ever heard of him.  He's, like, the most violent guy.  Charlie Bronson.  Charlie Bronson, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's a guy in England, legendarily the most violent.  Charles Bronson.  Well, that's where they got the name from, obviously.  His real name is Steven something, I think.  Seagal? 
[00:52:00]  No, no, no.  Although he is a better actor and a fucking better deputy sheriff.  This guy is a legendary sociopath.  Like, he just literally would put butter on his body and get naked and wait for the guards  come in.  Come on in.  He was a loved one.  He's been in prison, like, over 30 years now, right?  Well, he's done 30 in solitary confinement.  He's done, like, 36 years.  He's a fucking, he's not a nice guy.  What did he do to get in there?  He never killed anybody.  Wow.  It was probably just a traffic ticket.  Yeah.  He just never got out.  Yeah.  He never got out because he just couldn't behave. 
[00:52:30]  That library book, he just won't give it back.  Yeah, exactly.  Now it's a 30-year sentence.  What is the moment, though?  Wait, I want to know more about Charlie Bronson before MVP answers the question.  The movie is just called Bronson, and I've seen footage of the real guy.  It's a documentary?  Oh, it's a movie.  Okay, gotcha.  It's a really weird, artsy movie where the guy kind of plays him, and he was one of those  guys that you just couldn't befriend because he would eventually hurt you, but he did not  kill anybody.  They sent him away to a mental institution because he just kept beating up guards, and  he's a guy who loves to fight. 
[00:53:00]  He's just a violent, violent man.  And, you know, it was a decent movie.  Get him in the squared circle.  What's that?  Get him in the squared circle.  Is that a ring?  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, of course.  So back to MVP.  And so it got me, I saw it like four days ago, and it's got me thinking, like, when you're  in and, like, you know, you're going for lunch or whatever, what are one of those moments  where, like, you just want to do your thing and eat, and all of a sudden you know you're  in a fight?  Like, somebody does something that if you don't address, your time there is going to be miserable.  It's one of, it's just one of those moments you just know. 
[00:53:30]  It's not a situation where you go, hmm, let's see, this guy just called me a bitch  and took my brownie.  Maybe I should fight.  Case in point, years ago, when I was just breaking into business, I was sitting in a  locker room getting dressed, and this other wrestler who is a little well-known, he's  washed up now, but he stands over me and says, hey, you're sitting in my seat.  That's a fight.  There's nothing to discuss.  Right. 
[00:54:00]  Wow.  Because he's just trying you.  You're in my seat.  Fuck.  We're on Saturday, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're fine.  We're fine.  Fuck you, man.  You don't try me like that.  Nah, you know, he's just trying.  You're in my seat.  So you just get up and punch him in the mouth.  That's all.  That's nothing to discuss.  That's the only way to really handle that is just to get up and sock the guy in the mouth.  And that's what you did?  Well, what I did, because I was trying to get a job, it was the other company, TNA.  And I said, well, I find that hard to believe because I just moved that chair.  I just moved this chair here from over there and I stood up.  And his whole demeanor changed. 
[00:54:30]  This guy was known for kind of being a bit of a dick to like the young green guys, you know, trying to start out.  And he goes, oh, no, no.  I was just saying it every week.  That's my normal seat.  That's normally where I sit.  Whole demeanor changed.  Bitched out.  Yeah.  Who was it?  I got to know.  What's it rhyme with?  You're not saying anything bad about the guy.  You're just saying that he rhymes with Maven.  Shit.  Hogan.  Hulk Hogan.  No.  No, no, no.  Cliff Clavin?  Hulk Hogan doesn't dress good.  Rhymes with Maven.  Maven.  Shit.  Sam?  We all know.  Oh, I know. 
[00:55:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know what the rest of it is.  R with an R.  Okay.  It's just.  Oh, that's amazing.  You guys throw the bags out of the locker room, stuff like that.  It just shows that he has balls.  Rhymes with Maven.  Oh, man.  So there's no way when you're in jail something like that happens.  You have to just stand up and fucking pop up.  Pop the guy in the mouth.  No, you don't have to.  But I mean.  But you probably would be better to do that, you know, because, I mean, just deal with it  then or, you know, there's going to be backlash.  Yeah, but, you know, I don't get that.  So let's say you do have to fight in prison. 
[00:55:30]  Then is that guy backing down or is he going to want to fight you again because now you fought?  No rules.  Or is it kind of like hockey?  Hockey, these guys go at it and then they're like, okay, that's it.  We're done with this now.  Now, most of the guys that do that, you know, they want to take the path of least resistance,  you know?  So if you, you know, have a nice little mashup with a dude, you know, usually it's done.  Like, okay, man, I'm going to leave that guy alone, you know?  Hey, I remember, you know, I got an old buddy, Jimmy.  Jimmy was a redneck from Fort Myers and, you know, I used to say that a cracker will crumble  but a redneck will rumble. 
[00:56:00]  And Jimmy was a redneck.  And I remember he and I got to be cool because one day he was in the back hiding and he was  smoking a J and three guys, you know, three brothers stepped down on him.  Give me some of that.  And he was like, nah, you can't have my joint.  And they jumped him.  And I'm watching the whole thing.  I didn't know him yet.  You know, they beat him down good.  He got up, wiped the blood off his mouth.  That's all you guys got?  They came back, they jumped him again.  He got up, he said, man, we can do this all day.  They never bothered Jimmy again.  Never again.  You know, they were like, man, now he'll fight.  Let's leave him alone.  That's too much work. 
[00:56:30]  That's a headache.  Because even if you pop the guy and get the shippied out of you, at least he knows,  all right, you know, there's going to be a fucking issue.  Yeah, you're going to fight.  You're not just a pushover where they can just come and, okay, I'm going to take it.  If a guy is going to take yourself, he's got to be prepared.  Okay, well, this guy may actually fight.  Or, you know, if you stab somebody, then the guy might be like, all right, well, I can take it.  And he might not do anything right now, but then I've got to worry about maybe he might  want to, you know, catch me from behind later or what happens.  Path of least resistance.  Yeah, at least resistance.  What happened, now, this is what I've always wondered. 
[00:57:00]  We always feel prison rape and you're a big guy.  That probably wouldn't be something that you have to worry about.  I'm not a big guy and my ass is nicer than most people would think it is.  Believe me, I'm in trouble.  What would happen?  This is now, how do you get out of that?  I always thought, like, I would pretend I like it and then just try to get that fucking,  get that helmet by my mouth and sink my fucking teeth into it.  Now, you'll probably be all right because you're funny.  Yeah, you know, you ever heard Richard Pryor do that bit?  The fucking greatest bit, yeah.  Made him laugh all day to keep their minds off the booty.  You'd be that funny white boy.  Hey, man, he's all, man.  Hey, tell me some jokes, man. 
[00:57:30]  You'd just keep him laughing.  Jimmy would have a sore throat.  Under that pressure, I know I'd bomb.  Under the pressure of ass rape, I'd probably just tell awful jokes.  Knock, knock, boom.  You'd be writing like a maniac every night.  Jimmy just did a 200-hour set.  Yeah, I guess being funny helps, but I don't know if that would, you know.  Oh, that's just a nightmare.  That would be really funny.  Fucking nightmare.  You guys seen Jeff Ross lately?  Jeffrey Ross.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I saw him actually in L.A. 
[00:58:00]  How's he doing?  Good, good, good.  Yeah, I was, uh...  Yeah, he came in here to promote his book.  Okay.  Yeah, you know, the last time I was here, he, you know, made some comments about my fashionable attire,  you know?  Oh, yeah, that's right.  You had the big, uh, the gold on him.  God, you don't forget, huh?  No, I don't, I don't, never forget.  There's guys from junior high school I still want to run into.  No, but actually, it's funny because I just wanted to say, and, you know, prior, I mean,  I was familiar with your work, I'm a fan.  I wasn't really familiar.  I'd heard of Jeffrey Ross, but we're not really familiar with his work.  But after the fact, I thought, man, this guy's actually pretty funny. 
[00:58:30]  He wasn't funny that day in studio, but, you know, he's pretty funny, man.  He's actually really good.  I saw some of the roasts and stuff.  Yeah, he's really good at the roasts.  Oh, he's outstanding.  Outstanding.  So, give him my regards.  Tell him, uh, tell him I won't punch him in the face.  Absolutely.  We'll do that.  That's what you should do.  You should write your funny one on each fist and just fucking...  You like, say, you like prior.  Oh, that's, you know, but I think the, the, my, the two, my personal opinion, two greatest  comedians of all time, prior and Carlin. 
[00:59:00]  There you go.  I agree.  That's pretty much what we say.  Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, where do I come in on this?  Oh, he doesn't know who I'm doing.  He's doing dice.  What happened?  Yeah, exactly.  What happened?  Yeah.  What happened?  Look at Jimmy's, like, oh, fuck.  No, I don't mind hearing that.  I mean, you can make fun of dice if you want to, even though he changed my life.  I love the dice, man.  No, dice, dice, have his time, man. 
[00:59:30]  You know, it's, it's, it's actually kind of unfortunate, you know, that I was watching  that, uh, that show we had for a little while, you know, a guy sold out the garden and, and  yeah, now it's sad.  Can't, you know, can't fill up.  Sort of Kip Winger.  Local.  Those anomalies of life.  Yeah.  You're, you're an athlete, a professional athlete who obviously girls, you know, look,  girls like athletes.  Uh, they, they just do more than they like comics.  Um, what is your, uh, you know, you married guy? 
[01:00:00]  No.  Uh, no.  Okay.  So what did you, what's that?  Married man.  Married man.  How about, uh, uh, first of all, I have to ask you, cause Sam put down that Sherry  Shepard has been seen at a few of your shows.  And so of course I have to ask.  Yeah.  Uh, Sherry Shepard and I are really good friends.  Uh, you know, we had a few pod, we had, uh, she came, we did something together on SmackDown  and then, uh, I took, when I was still on SmackDown on Raw now, but, and then we had a thing  where I took her to her high school prom and, you know, we got a lot of coverage off of 
[01:00:30]  that.  And then, uh, I was her date to the BET awards.  And we're just really, really good friends.  You know, we're, we're cool.  She's an, you know, awesome person, but, uh, when friends with benefits, no, no, no, no,  no, no, no, no.  We, uh, you know, she's an awesome person.  Is she still on The View again?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's still on there.  She's on The View.  She's got her, uh, her, uh, sitcom now.  Sherry comes on the Lifetime Network.  She's, she's, she's, she's hustling, man.  She's going hard.  She might live in my building.  I saw her on the elevator one time and I couldn't remember, like I knew where I knew her from 
[01:01:00]  and I'm like, I, uh, and then she got off the elevator.  Um, um, uh, what'd you take on, uh, on, on this Tiger Woods situation?  I mean, you, uh, leave the guy alone, man.  That pisses me off.  It's none of your business is between him and his wife.  Although I do find it amusing that his wife kicked his ass.  I thought that was funny.  Yeah.  But I mean, really, man.  I mean, if, if, if I had his money, I would just have a harem in, in, on, on premises.  You know what I'm saying?  I wouldn't even, are you serious? 
[01:01:30]  Might be where he's headed.  He may.  You know, I, you know, when, when, when, when the president gets censured before Congress  because he gets a blow job and this is a headline news, we're concerned about this, you know,  the moral decay of, of, of our society and what, really is this, we got nothing.  We got, oh, wars in, in Iraq and Afghanistan and you got corporations dumping waste in your,  your backyard, all this other stuff going on.  And they're worried about Tiger Woods's infidelity and how many women he may or may have not. 
[01:02:00]  This is exactly what Tiger told his wife.  Hey, there's wars going on.  What are you doing, huh?  He's got a war in his house.  There was a war in his living room.  Yeah, no kidding.  The vestibule, the bedroom, the bathroom.  Oh, you know, she threw one of his golf trophies at him, you know, one that he really liked.  It's just, but it's a, the story's just amazing just because we thought we knew who Tiger Woods  was or the image they portrayed on TV, obviously.  You never know who anybody is.  And that whole thing is bullshit.  Oh, no, I, I, I'm not that stupid, but with this Tiger, it, it sounded like he had a squeaky  clean fucking, you know. 
[01:02:30]  Those are always the ones that are not.  Are the worst, right?  Yeah, you know, and these, you know, these religious, these preacher guys come out and  you find out they were in a crack house with, you know, with a whore or whatever.  And to me, it's ridiculous.  You know, in the end, I don't care, but I do find it very fascinating.  You know, where he was and where he is today within, what, less than a month.  And, you know, I, I, somebody that I know said a long time ago, like you, you look at, uh,  like Whitney Houston, she is as ghetto as they come, but you didn't know that for years because  her people had her hidden. 
[01:03:00]  I mean, they did a great job of presenting her as this classy, educated diva.  You didn't really know how hood she was.  And then it comes out, oh my God.  No, she's always been that way.  You know, and, and, you know, in our society, we're, we're intelligent enough to know that  everything is packaged for your entertainment, you know, your, your favorite singer or whatever.  And when you do have a performer that comes out and says, Hey man, this is just how I am.  Then, you know, they're a bad boy or, or, you know, they're, uh, cutting edge or whatever.  Man, you know, most people, you know, are, have issues that publicly wouldn't be accepted, 
[01:03:30]  you know, more questionable morals or what have you.  But give me a break.  You're right on with that.  You're right on with that whole thing.  And it's so weird.  How are the wrestling groupies?  Uh, they, they're, they're, they're, they're at every, uh, right now, you know what?  I gotta be honest with you.  It's, uh, I'm a day late and a dollar short, man.  We're, we're PG now, you know, during the attitude era.  Oh, right, right, right.  They were, you know, you didn't have to leave the hotel lobby.  They were there waiting for you, but now we're PG. 
[01:04:00]  We're family oriented.  So, you know, we got to wait another 10 years for our groupies to grow up.  Goddamn Vince.  What did he do?  No more pussy for anybody.  That's right.  No one's getting any more pussy or you're fine.  We are family oriented entertainment.  That's right.  For the money is no, no, no, you know, the whole Disney thing.  I like when Moolah had a hand fall out of her vagina.  I can't lie.  Actually, no, it was, uh, the good old day.  May Young.  May Young gave birth to the hand. 
[01:04:30]  That was when we were all in.  I gotta be honest, man.  MVP, uh, the, uh, the, the edge they had, the, the attitude, the storylines.  Wow.  We loved it.  It was insanity.  It was nothing but sex violence.  And, and why did it change?  What happened?  I forget now.  Uh, there was, there was some, well, there are two things.  One, the WWE is now a publicly traded corporation.  So there's a board of directors and, and it's not a family operated business anymore.  There are people to answer to.  And two, uh, Vince wants to take the company corporate. 
[01:05:00]  I mean, he, and you gotta think he took a regional wrestling promotion and turned it  into a multinational billion dollar corporation.  You know, we're, our program is on a hundred countries translated in over 20 languages.  And I tell people all the time, you know, when I was a heel, I challenge you to find Luxembourg  on a map.  Most people have no idea, but in Luxembourg, those people knew how to say MVP sucks.  You know, they got that.  And we go to places, you know, it's, it's amazing. 
[01:05:30]  And when we were in Iraq and, and the chow halls, you know, uh, somebody coined the term  LBM, little brown men, all the, the staff that work in the kitchen, uh, it looked like,  you know, the, the scene from the Titanic where like the, the passengers in the lower  decks are all trying to get out.  Every window you pass, you know, they're all there trying to see and everywhere in the  world we go, they know who we are.  And Vince did that from just a little regional promotion to cable TV.  And that was getting rid of the edge.  Well, you know, he wants to take, he wants to major corporate sponsors. 
[01:06:00]  He wants to make it, you know, top tier the entertainment.  Where do you think where, like, where is a place that you wouldn't expect wrestling  to be huge where you've gone?  Oh my God, the Middle East.  It is big in the Middle East, right?  Oh yeah.  What, what was the documentary I saw?  And it was on all the TVs.  What the hell was it?  Where in the world is Osama Bin Laden.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I haven't seen it.  Where in the world is Osama Bin Laden by, uh, Morgan Spurlock.  Yeah.  It was, it was Spurlock's documentary.  And he's in these just local houses in, in the middle of some scary places in the, in the 
[01:06:30]  Middle East, uh, Middle East and, uh, and, and wrestling's on the TV and they're all wearing  the wrestling t-shirts and everything.  Oh Jesus.  They, they know, man.  When we were walking through the PX or I was walking through, you know, all the, the,  the local Afghanis, uh, MVP, MVP.  Oh, really?  They knew you in Afghanistan?  Yeah, yeah.  No, I'm sorry.  The Iraqis.  The Iraqis.  I'm sorry.  The local.  Wow.  They, they, they knew who you were.  It's, uh, in, we have an office, WWE has opened up an office in China.  And they're about to expand into, into China.  Yeah, her vagina's big enough. 
[01:07:00]  Sorry, I thought you, uh, I misunderstood that.  Have you seen The Night in China?  Stupid China.  I loved it.  I like a girl like that.  Jimmy loved it.  Jimmy, it was terrible.  Yeah, thank you.  Yeah, it turns a little bit, a little big, but I prefer a girl like that.  It's a penis.  No, it's not.  It's a penis.  She's just a girl with fun panties.  MVP, you like that?  Nah.  Thank you.  None of us did.  Jimmy liked it, though.  I like girls.  For the record, Jimmy loved it.  I mean, no, I'm not intimidated, but I'd knock it down, you know what I'm saying? 
[01:07:30]  You know, get enough alcohol for him, but.  I would imagine it just doesn't smell right.  Hey, you know what?  I have to, I have to, I'd imagine it'd be a weird smell.  Like, wait, that's not, that's not, that's not, that's not a female smell.  No, you'd be surprised.  Jimmy, you'd be surprised.  You'd be surprised.  I like a girl with a little fucking gaminess to her.  Oh my God.  I really do.  Just a gaminess.  Yeah, I like that.  I've never heard of it put that away before.  I just went running.  Aaron, forget that shower.  Please, man.  No deodorant. 
[01:08:00]  I like a girl not wearing deodorant.  Let's get back to this China thing.  So you guys opened up an office in China?  Yeah, we're going to expand into China.  We were supposed to do a tour there a while back, but they ended up putting it on hold.  Part of the problem with China, they prepped us beforehand and said, you know, if you go into China, we have to be, if we did a tour in China, you have to be exceedingly cautious about what you say.  Or they were saying in interviews, be very careful.  Don't criticize the government or anything like that.  Oh, yeah.  The problem with China is, I think part of the reason they canceled our tour was because they, I guess there was some band that went there a week before and right before they were supposed to play, the government just came in and said, nope, you guys can't play. 
[01:08:30]  So, what are you going to do?  You know, the Stones had to change a couple of lyrics, too.  Like, yeah, they had to change a couple of their lyrics for their songs because the Chinese government found it to be offensive.  Like, I think it's let's spend the night together.  It was let's spend some time together.  There's a couple of things that are really weird.  They had to do that on Ed Sullivan.  Yeah, they did that on Ed Sullivan.  Then there was another change they had to make for China. 
[01:09:00]  Maybe I'm mixing up the changes, but they had to do it in China, too.  You should tell them it's my way or nothing.  Or the highway.  Yeah, absolutely.  Well, not when you've got a billion potential customers that want to buy pay-per-views and merchandise or whatever else.  And don't make fun when they call it Ressering.  It's horrible.  Well, you know, the cool thing about it is even if he's not laughing at that, Vince, don't worry.  Don't worry, Vince.  No, no, sir, I'm not.  The thing that's so cool about it is you can watch it with the volume off, and you get it. 
[01:09:30]  This is a good guy.  This is a bad guy.  This is a guy I want to win.  So, I mean, it's just the good old-fashioned story of good versus evil.  And usually the good guys win in the end, at least in our version.  That's a billion potential customers.  You're right.  That's the way they look at it.  How about you guys, mixed martial arts is huge now.  We love the UFC and stuff like that.  And Dana's kind of done the same thing Vince has done.  I don't know if it's to the same size yet.  No, not.  But you know what I'm saying?  It's like it's the same thing.  Taking this local thing and making it international. 
[01:10:00]  Are they in China yet?  MMA or no?  No.  I don't believe.  Well, didn't they kind of like invent it?  Yeah.  It kind of came from China.  It's what they do during weddings and birthday parties.  Martial arts, of course.  Well, yeah.  You know what I'm saying.  Jesus.  Of course.  That's a good point.  Has martial arts made it to China yet?  Good question.  I'm very in touch with what's happening.  That's great.  Yes.  Hey, have small dicks made it to Japan yet?  All right.  Thanks, Dan.  Yes, shit.  Unbelievable.  All right, well, the special is, it really is great, man. 
[01:10:30]  It's WWE, tribute to the troops.  MVP went over there, and it's this Saturday.  It's 9 o'clock.  It's on NBC, which is us.  NBC, yeah.  In a nutshell, we went and visited the bases, and on the third day, we did a show in front  of about, I think, 7,000 troops.  Nice.  And they taped the matches, and they put it together, and turn it into a special.  They'll take footage from our time on the bases, interacting with the troops and whatnot,  and turn it into a pretty cool special.  And I got to tell you, on a personal note, if you don't have relatives, if you don't have 
[01:11:00]  family, or if you don't have a personal connection, then when you watch it on TV, these are just  nameless faces that are a million miles away.  But after having an opportunity to go there and meet some of the guys and hear some of  their personal stories there about their families, you meet a kid that's 25 years old, and he's  a captain.  You know, he's responsible for thousands of people.  You're 25.  You can't even shave yet, barely, you know?  It really changes your perspective, and it was a humbling experience, man. 
[01:11:30]  It was all the way around.  You just, you take things for granted, but when you're over there, and you know, you're  hearing about, you know, this guy was in the National Guard, and he just, you know,  used to work at the drugstore, and now he's in Iraq with an M4, and he's, you know, literally  fighting for his life.  It really changes things, and the Tribute to the Troop Special is our most patriotic show  of the year, and you know, the WWE, all our live events, anywhere around the world, we  give free tickets to active service, active military people. 
[01:12:00]  So just to let your listeners know, if you're in the service, and you're active duty, and  there's a WWE show in your area, show up, show your ID, and man, we'll take care of  you.  Awesome.  That's cool.  Excellent, man.  Right on.  MVP from the WWE.  We've got to take a break here.  When is that air?  Saturday.  Saturday, December 19th.  NBC.  Very cold.  Very cold.  It's this Saturday.  Thanks a lot, man, and thanks for going over there.  You know, again, the Troops always appreciate it, but, you know, it's just nice to see  guys still going over there and not fucking forgetting that they're still over there fighting. 
[01:12:30]  Absolutely.  It sucks.  All right, let's take a break.  Thank you, MVP.  Hey, thanks for having me.  There's always a good time on this.  I greatly appreciate it.  Saturday, 9 o'clock.  Hit it.  All right, let's do this.  So, we've got another Scott and Todd clip.  Want to give this another shot?  Yes.  I do.  All right.  Well, I didn't like the earlier shot we gave because it was kind of an interesting story.  They didn't make it any more interesting.  They didn't elaborate on it.  It was just like a boring news report of a story, but I kind of, you know, found the story 
[01:13:00]  a little compelling.  And this comes from the fact that Citadel Broadcasting, a big radio company that I think  they filed for bankruptcy the last day or two, named Scott Shannon Vice President of Programming  for their radio company.  And they wonder why they had to file for bankruptcy.  It's a dumb move.  That's great.  It is.  It's like being named Captain of the Titanic after the iceberg.  Well.  Exactly.  Yeah, but I.  See, it wasn't meant as a joke, more as a metaphor that people can understand. 
[01:13:30]  One would hope.  Scott Shannon was a very creative programmer many, many years ago, but he hasn't been creative  in well over a decade.  It's been a while.  And his own fucking show is really lame here in New York City.  It's extremely lame.  Lame.  So why would you, you know, take that and go, you know what?  We need more lameness.  We need this guy.  We want to spread your lameness across America to all our property.  Well, I guess so.  Also, they're thinking we can only go up.  Nah.  We're bankrupt. 
[01:14:00]  Just dumb.  Radio in general, dumb.  I disagree, Hope.  I think they're doing a terrific job.  Well, here's another clip to prove.  This is from Scott and Todd this morning.  This is what they're doing with their show.  There was a fellow by the name of Stanley Dudek in Massachusetts.  Stanley Dudek returned his overdue library book 99 years, 7 months, and 12 days after  it was checked out.  Did he check it out?  No. 
[01:14:30]  His deceased mother did.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  He was sifting through her possessions, found the book, Facts I Ought to Know About the Government  of My Country.  It was due back May the 2nd, 1910.  Oh, boy.  Shoot.  They were happy to have it back.  What's the fine on that?  I don't know.  We've got to send a book crook over to it.  Amnesty month?  I think so.  Probably.  10 cents a day for 100 years.  I'm a little bit late.  99 years ago, my mother checked this thing out.  You're welcome. 
[01:15:00]  Okay.  That's much better.  All right.  Now, I have a full appreciation of the suckdom that is that show.  So, I would assume he would suggest to the rest of the radio stations that they read wacky  news stories.  Yes.  Right.  And maybe he could have mentioned what other books were available at the time.  Well, if you've got some creativity, you certainly could at least take that and run with it and  make it into something.  Yes.  The Health Benefits of Smoking. 
[01:15:30]  Why the Negro Must Not Be Allowed to Purchase Marmalade.  It's a great book.  Ah, shit.  Yeah, that's pretty...  That was the clip I was looking for.  All right.  Yeah.  So, there's your example.  Let's get your Tiger Woods update out of the way.  Tiger.  This is going to take a while.  And we got some kind of snowboard to give away?  What is that?  Well, it's a thing...  What is it, Jimmy?  It looks to me like a giant emery board. 
[01:16:00]  I was filing my nails with it.  No.  Oh.  It's a big snowboard.  Very cool snowboard.  Yes.  It says I heart something on it.  I heart.  There's a space to write something in.  Yeah, it's a love board.  Oh, I see.  It's got like a babe on it.  It says love on it.  Yeah, so we give it away.  I'm not sure to who, but I mean, we do give it away.  I'm not sure for the snowboarders.  It's a cool gift, though.  Yeah. 
[01:16:30]  A couple of beautiful girls.  A couple of beautiful girls.  Oh, there's two bras.  Yeah, there's a blonde.  There's a brunette and a blonde, depending which way you're going down the mountain.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I'm not sure what the push of it is.  Like, what exactly, what company is it?  I mean, I want to make sure we give it away right.  I mean, it's really a cool thing, though.  If you're a snowboarder.  I don't snowboard in particular, but I mean, this one is actually.  Well, maybe there's some more info on the board. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, hold on.  Yeah, maybe the other side.  Get it off the ground.  Yeah.  It says here, when you turn it up, get lifted, 2009, 2010.  Buy this snowboard and get a free lift ticket.  Oh.  I don't know if that means anything, because we're giving it away.  That's cool.  All right.  So what exactly is this snowboard we're giving away, and what do people have to do to get  it, Dan?  Do we know any details?  It's a Burton love board, Jimmy.  Burton love board.  Burton love board.  These are good, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Burton's the best ones?  Okay.  Yeah, that's a good one, man.  This is a brand new snowboard.  How much do these things cost?  I would say about $550.  Wow.  $550, I'm going with. 
[01:17:30]  Wow.  All right.  So what do they have to do to win it?  Because obviously, a lot of people are going to call up and want it.  Do we have a contest or something?  What should they do to have to get that great gift?  You guys can do whatever you want.  You can take a caller or...  Just so we want to enjoy the last day.  Hold on a minute.  How about this?  Hold on a minute.  Yes, Jimmy.  See here.  Yeah.  He's got these little markings on here.  Is this where you would put your... 
[01:18:00]  There's grooved markings, like these little...  That's where...  Yes, that's where you would have to put your, you know...  Skates?  Not skates.  I don't know what you...  Your bindings.  What are bindings?  You put your bindings there, and then you can step in onto the board.  Yeah.  And be attached to it.  But dude, you're fucking...  Won't this hurt your legs?  Huh?  These are supposed to be very fun.  Yeah, yeah.  What are you talking about?  You put your bindings in there.  A boogie board.  Yeah, yeah.  You're riding a boogie board.  Yeah, you're riding a boogie board.  It's a snowboard, not a boogie board. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, you're snowboard.  You're riding...  You've never snowboarded?  No, I'm just doing...  What's Scott Chatton?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Never snowboarded.  I understand the impression.  I laid on a rock once.  I made up my trip.  Jimmy, it's the Burton Love Board.  Yeah.  And gift card giveaway.  That's what we're talking about here.  I'm not a good snowboarder.  But this is fucking cool.  This actually looks like it'll be fun.  Yeah.  Yeah, doesn't it?  What do they get?  The gift card?  They get a free lift ticket, right?  Well, with that, I guess.  Okay. 
[01:19:00]  Well, what do we have to do?  How do we give this away?  This is nice.  I don't know.  How do you want to give it away?  We ought to have some kind of thematic thing.  Yeah, like what?  Oh, I'm watching people do it.  Oh, no.  How do we give this one away?  Oh, see?  That's somebody snowboarding, Jimmy.  Very cool.  Look at that.  This is actually really nice, man.  These girls on here are sexy.  Yeah, they sure are.  What should we do?  Well, God damn.  Do people spit in the air like this?  Yeah.  Fat air.  This makes me want to fucking try it.  What should we do, though, like, to give this away? 
[01:19:30]  What's wrong with them?  I love this.  Two beautiful faces.  How about we just do this?  Because we've got a lot of show to do today.  Tenth caller gets it.  Why not?  Be caller number ten right now to win a love board and gift card for Burton Snowboards.  Can't we do something fun with it, though?  Check out the latest gear and find your local dealers at Burton.com.  Believe in snowboarding.  The prize is valued at just under $550.  Must be at least 18 years old and a listener or subscriber to enter. 
[01:20:00]  We're not open to residents of Alaska, Hawaii, or Canada.  Well, Hawaii, I guess, yeah.  Lava board.  Yeah, what are you going to do in Hawaii?  In Hawaii, there is no snow.  But Alaska and Canada, that's where you get the most snow.  You can just snowboard to work.  Why say no to those people?  I know, the Alaskans, what are you going to do, snowboard all over Juneau or something?  What, they don't want to pay for the postage to send it over there?  I guess so.  I was thinking we should probably have, well, you already said how we're giving away. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, but we've got more to give away.  So the next one will get a little better with this.  Give it away to whoever calls from the coldest place at that moment in the United States.  Yeah, I agree.  That stinks so they could just lie.  No, they can't.  They can lie.  No, they have to give their address to get the snowboard and we can check the weather.  I've got the idea.  I've got the best giveaway.  I have an app for that.  Me too. 
[01:21:00]  Yes.  What's the best way?  You call up.  Right.  And you give your best snowboarding story.  And the one we find to be the most inspirational.  Are you all right?  Yes, I am.  Are you having a nervous breakdown or something?  I'm really not.  Could you pick up the snowboard?  Sure, I just got some good snowboard jokes.  Yes, we can do with this.  I like it.  You can ride this down to some mashed potatoes.  You'd look very cool with the chicks on that board, though. 
[01:21:30]  Like, could you see sliding up?  You do that thing by the lodge and then everybody looks at you and you got two, like, sexy chicks on your snowboard.  Yeah, no, it's actually really cool.  I mean, you'd probably look really cool zipping around on this.  It's a lot different than the other plain ones.  Yeah, yeah.  But, all right, we've got the 10th caller, I guess, and it's a Burton.  These are supposed to be, I don't know anything about snowboarding, but apparently these are very good.  And it says, it's very subdued, you can see blonde brunette, blonde brunette all over the board. 
[01:22:00]  It says that.  Look in her hair and you'll see it.  I prefer not to, that's, uh...  It's, um, not that hair.  Oh.  The hair.  And she is, uh, more than life-size photos of these women, by the way.  Their heads are just giant, huh?  Jeez.  I've never snowboarded, but, uh...  Yeah.  Danny, do you snowboard?  What the fuck is going on?  I've never snowboarded.  Look, Burton.com, thank you.  Phones are, uh...  They're lit.  Because people like snowboarding.  Yeah, I know they do. 
[01:22:30]  Let's do the tires.  But it's not good in Canada?  Or Alaska?  Or Hawaii?  But where would you...  Go ahead, Chip.  They can do a...  Do Waikiki snowboarding or something?  That's Chip?  Yeah.  Yeah, Chip is a, what, a comic?  No, he's just a guy who says some funny stuff.  Oh, okay.  You know, well...  Go for it, it's Chip.  Yeah?  Hates.  Is that what you were mentioning earlier about...  Something Annoying that your girlfriend does?  No.  Oh, no.  I was just going to say, how do you annoy your girlfriend?  When she's watching a reality show, find the girl that she hates the most and just talk 
[01:23:00]  about how hot she is.  Yeah, that'll do it.  What reality show?  She's watching Bad Girls Club and she hates this one girl.  I'm like, why?  She's really pretty.  Bad Girls Club is actually pretty good.  I know.  She's a pretty good show.  I mean, she's beautiful.  She's not.  She looks like a fucking boy.  And does she fight with you like, no!  She was so aggravated.  She looks like a tranny.  No wonder you like her.  Oh, she was...  Oh, good shot.  Yeah.  Couldn't argue.  Let's do some Tiger Woods action.  As long as we don't poke fun.  Tiger Woods!  Be nice.  So, here's the bullet points for today. 
[01:23:30]  Uh-oh, duck.  Uh-oh, Jimmy.  It's not real bullets.  That's a name.  Several...  Chip.  Shit.  Several.  Women, say Tiger, regularly pay them between $5,000 and $20,000 a month for their silence.  Ah, they regularly pay them $5,000 and $20,000.  Yeah, that's a lot of money. 
[01:24:00]  Really, it's amazing that there's so much money that you can pay in Tiger Woods.  Yeah, why don't you just use that money to buy yourself a house, sir?  His teeth are ready to fly out of his head.  I can hire somebody to hold my teeth in my mouth for that kind of money.  Good luck at Citadel.  Good luck.  That's a lot of money.  That is a lot of fucking money.  And are any of these girls coming forward and yapping?  Yeah, they're absolutely yapping. 
[01:24:30]  You can't prove it, prove it, because it's a wire, uh, uh, wire...  Wire transfer?  Oh, very clandestine.  But it was just a known fact that he was wiring the money for what we just said.  And what, uh, there's no...  What record do you get of that?  I'm sure there's records of wire transfers.  Yeah, yeah.  So I don't think it's something that Tiger can deny.  It's, you know, he...  The money has...  It's just...  Oh, my God.  It's been said a lot. 
[01:25:00]  It's just...  It's amazing.  It's just amazing.  All from turning...  From seeing that thing on the little ticker, breaking news...  Tiger in an accident.  Tiger Woods in an auto accident.  Right.  And you're like, oh, okay.  And then it goes from that to where we are now.  I think we're 20 days in.  Yeah, and he's been on the cover.  And there's new facts coming out still every day.  Right.  Still.  Yeah.  And this money, I don't think, is involved with the new broads that came out.  I think this is for old broads. 
[01:25:30]  Old broads.  That aren't talking because they got their paydays, for the most part.  Yeah.  I believe.  What do you think the number is for real?  Like, like, totally...  Oh, for the last...  Just in the time he's been married.  The time he's been married...  Because who gives a shit?  Who gives a shit in general?  It's got to be in the hundreds.  At least three, you know, three digits.  It's got to be...  Do you think he's had sex with 100 girls since he's been married?  Absolutely.  Wow.  Really?  These are high-profile ones that are coming out, talking, yapping, you know, shit like 
[01:26:00]  that.  There's absolutely more that just aren't saying anything.  Maybe took the shut-up money and are shutting up.  Maybe still taking shut-up money.  How many girls that, if they came out, no one would believe them, but they really did have  sex with Tiger?  Right.  Fucking Denny's waitress?  Right, right.  Wow.  You think 100 in the last five years?  I would say...  Since he got married?  Yes.  I would say, yeah.  Why not?  Why not?  Is that crazy?  This guy is fucking like a maniac.  Well, we're pushing 20 girls that have come forward. 
[01:26:30]  Absolutely.  And just about all of them saying they had sex with him while he was married.  Yeah.  So that's almost 20 right there.  Got her.  Wow.  Okay.  Elin will take the kids.  This one is just amazing.  Elin will take the kids and go to Sweden for Christmas.  Oh, boy.  And Tiger's going to hang out with his guy pals.  Oh, his guy friends?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you think he's going to be doing with his guy friends?  Depressed. 
[01:27:00]  Where's some Christmas?  Give me some Christmas music.  Give me a little bit of Christmas tunes.  Like festive, nice holiday music.  You could need one that's a little somber.  Yeah?  Because I know what you want to do.  A little somber.  No, I'm just thinking of how Tiger would feel.  Because think about it.  There's going to be festive music playing.  He's been married for how many years now?  30.  Jesus.  A long time.  I don't know.  Four or five years?  Four or five years.  He's had that first Christmas with the girl. 
[01:27:30]  Dude, he's got a 10-month-old.  He's had, yeah.  He's had baby's first Christmas.  Yeah, that's a special time for family.  Baby's first Christmas.  If baby's first Christmas, we'll be in Sweden.  We'll be in Sweden without daddy.  Without daddy.  That can't be good.  With a wedding ringless mommy.  You think I'll meet her in Sweden?  No.  No.  She does not want this motherfucker near her.  I don't know how they're going to work this one out.  They said they were trying to work shit out, but it's not looking like the shit is being  worked out. 
[01:28:00]  So she's going to be in Sweden with her family and probably getting all kinds of attention.  And Tiger will just be sitting at home.  One of my friends coming over.  Got the tree.  My wife left me.  My kid.  There's Christmas presents to the kids wrapped, not being unwrapped on Christmas morning.  Because the kid just fly all the gifts over to Sweden. 
[01:28:30]  Oh my God.  She probably doesn't even want to open up any of those.  He'll put this on like this.  Yeah.  And just be like, maybe I'll just go to sleep to Christmas music.  Remind me of happier times.  Oh, it's Christmas morning.  Oh, I better get down before the kids get there.  Oh, we're going to make hot chocolate.  My wife took my children and I'm spending Christmas alone.  Oh dear God.  What did I do? 
[01:29:00]  Play a happy, play an upbeat Christmas song.  Just to see.  There we go.  Oh, this is terrible.  How about a fucking jingle bell rock or something?  No, this is perfect.  Fucking Christmas music.  Yeah, jingle bells, you fucking cunt.  No, this is a good one.  Christmas time.  I hate this song.  Is this Paul McCartney?  I know.  Yes.  Thanks.  Smell his wife's leg stump.  That's what she wants for Christmas. 
[01:29:30]  Lice off of the leg stump.  I hate this song.  Put on Christmas music.  You don't put on fucking jingle bells.  I'm going to bite your cock.  What's wrong with that last one?  That's terrible.  It's not traditional.  What is this?  No.  What are you doing?  This isn't the jingle bell song we all know.  No.  There is.  I want a Christmas song that just is fucking Christmas songs.  This is what Bing Crosby's kids would hear in their head as he beat them with a liquor,  fucking with a whiskey flask.  Well, they were coming to it again. 
[01:30:00]  Here we go.  Laughing all the way.  Ho, ho, ho.  Get over here, you little fuck.  Yeah, the kids weren't laughing.  No.  Not this jingle bell.  You know what we want.  Give us another jingle bell.  Oh, I want a fucking...  What about like I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas?  Just a musical version.  Something fun.  I don't want to get the Andrews sisters.  Well, let's see what he comes up with.  Reminds me of an Allied victory.  Yeah.  Boy, that singing technique went out, didn't it? 
[01:30:30]  That's not around anymore.  What happened?  See, the problem is I don't know what White Christmas is just an instrumental in here.  Why don't you just play anyone before you're immediately terminated?  Yeah, think on your feet.  What do you got?  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  This could be the worst one.  Can we go on YouTube and find Jingle Bells?  No, I'd rather work with Travis here.  He's doing a horrible job.  This could be the worst pick ever. 
[01:31:00]  What are you doing?  What's this from?  Yeah, what is this?  A manic depressive Christmas?  It's fucking horrid.  This is the Drifters.  I don't care.  The Drifters?  Exactly, you fucking old man.  Get something younger.  All right, let's see what he comes up with.  It's like Lead Belly.  You got Lead Belly's Christmas?  I have a crash test dummy.  No.  No.  We're doing traditional.  We don't want some fucking stupid remake.  All right, pick one that you think would be traditional.  Jingle Bells, your clit face. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, we forgot.  Isn't Travis half a Jew or something?  Yeah, he doesn't know.  Oh, no.  His mom took off with a Jew.  My proxy.  Yeah.  She took a fucking, she took a dreidel in every hole.  That's what the menorah was.  She had one candle in each hole and fucking five extra candles.  One for each hand and one for each foot.  Holy shit.  And one on her belly.  Sorry.  Travis, come on.  Another one.  Come on, Travis.  Another one, please.  Come on.  Not the drifters. 
[01:32:00]  Oh.  Has potential, Ant.  Potential?  I'm dreaming.  This is traditional.  It is, but we asked for Jingle Bells, which is kind of upbeat and fun.  Half of you were asking for Jingle Bells.  The other half won.  There's three of us.  How did half do anything?  1.5 of us?  Who is this?  This is just labeled Holiday Inn.  Holiday Inn?  Yeah.  Then it's from the movie Holiday Inn.  Probably.  Yeah.  So I think it's Bing again.  Okay.  It is Bing, right? 
[01:32:30]  You want Jingle Bells or you want Jingle Bell Rock?  Hold on, Ant's doing something.  I'm sorry.  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  He was...  Oh, he was quite the vermudgeon.  You want to talk about a guy that was very different than the image on TV.  Yeah, exactly.  They talked about Tiger.  Fuck that.  Bing was a bad, bad boy.  He sure was.  Have a belt of booze. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, yeah, man.  Fucking...  Get your kid's blood all over the reindeer on your sweater.  His kids hate it.  Yeah.  His fucking...  The white snowflakes on his sweater had speckles of sunblood on them.  From a good batch of the chops.  Oh.  And remember, everybody, smoke Lucky Strike Cigarettes.  Let's all have a Negro-less Christmas.  Wonderful.  Snowmen are white. 
[01:33:30]  Is it?  What?  Trees?  Who knows?  And children listen.  And children listen.  Now listen to me.  Oh, punch in the face.  Yeah.  Repeat what I said.  To hear sleigh bells in the snow.  Ba-ba-ba-ba, you missed the note, cunt.  Oh, he's whistling.  He's Steve the Whistler.  Wait, what did he do?  With every Christmas Finance in the New Yorkic Express.? 
[01:34:00]  Do something we didn't realize in the winter?  Do anything we'd know in the spring?  May you truly feel good with the snow.

[01:45:30]  spray painting  subway cars  in Brooklyn  does  I'm a fan  of the graffiti  because I was  an old school  graffiti artist  myself  graffiti  graffiti  my specialty  was the  t-shine  just the word  the who  the backwards  swat sticker  just the word  the who  right  repent 13  the hell  yeah those  type of things  it's a guerrilla  movement  that's the way  it goes  and it's the  heart getting  up  getting known  and then you  take that  vehicle 
[01:46:00]  and you go  all the places  once they know  you  the higher  you can tag  something  the more  respect  you're going  to get  the more  outlandish  you tag  the more  respect  you're going  to get  in the community  I know a person  everywhere they go  they tag  Mighty Horse  Rocks the Fat Ass  Mighty Horse  Rocks the Fat Ass  Mighty Horse  Rocks the Fat Ass  Mighty Horse  Rocks the Fat Ass  Mighty Horse  Rocks the Fat Ass  Mighty Horse 
[01:46:30]  Rocks the Fat Ass  When Mighty Horse rocks, he rocks a fat ass.  When Mighty Horse rocks, he rocks a fat ass.  Everybody else can live by the rules, except for the graffiti artist.  When you see the Mighty Horse rocks, you don't spell rocks, R-O-X.  When Mighty Horse rocks, he rocks a fat ass.  What about my tag, Monkey House?  Only I pronounce it like this, Monkey House.  When Monkey House rocks, he rocks a fat ass.  When Monkey House rocks, he rocks a fat ass. 
[01:47:00]  Monkey House?  Because that's the name I tag with.  Monkey House of D-Sippers.  When Monkey House rocks, he rocks the D-Sippers.  When Monkey House rocks, he rocks the D-Sippers.  I like this.  See, his voice fits something like this.  Mighty Horse rocks the fat ass?  I could do without this part.  Mighty Horse rocks, he rocks a fat ass.  Fat ass.  Mighty Horse rocks, he rocks a fat ass.  Mighty Horse rocks the fat ass.  All right, then here's what I want you to do. 
[01:47:30]  I want you to get a plane and tag the sky.  Shot a boot break.  There you go, man.  See, that's enjoyable.  But his voice is good for that.  That Christmas song is fucking depressing.  I would like the Christmas song if he just changed some of the lyrics.  I don't dislike the Christmas song.  I just don't like that he says,  Holy, holy.  I don't like any of it.  That's my favorite part.  No, that's my favorite part.  Travis, play that again so we can discuss it.  Which one?  Duck, play the video with it or the animation at the same time. 
[01:48:00]  I want to see the animation.  Hold on.  Great.  No, you know what it is?  His voice is not conducive for Christmas music.  I'm sorry.  Call me a traditionalist.  Call me an asshole.  Call me an asshole traditionalist.  I don't care.  I don't like it.  Oh, you like the Christmas song?  I tell you why I would like it if it wasn't for that one lyric part that bugs me.  I don't dislike his voice in it.  I like the tone of it. 
[01:48:30]  La, la, la, la, la.  See, it's catchy.  No, it's catchy, all right.  It's catchy.  So is H1N1.  It's catchy.  I don't want it.  Come on.  This is the animation?  This is CokeLogic's animation of the Sleeves Christmas song?  Oh, good.  You can put Sleeves Christmas song in YouTube.  All right.  Piano play.  Maybe, maybe a visual.  I was feeling pretty good.  La, la, la, la, la.  Taking my time on the la, la, la, la, la.  Snow falling down in the la, la, la, la, la.  Everybody's singing like la, la, la, la. 
[01:49:00]  Taking on a heart with the la, la, la, la.  Making my way to the la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  He's going to a happy place.  He's forgetting his troubles.  He's in a depressing shack.  Yeah, it doesn't matter where he lives.  That's terrible.  That's the point.  I'd like to drink a little beer at the end of the day.  We're all walking in the town.  Be like a million miles away. 
[01:49:30]  Not as cold as like a sea.  Like a sand above the beach.  The lights walking in the trees.  The people shining in the street.  And the people in the light.  All the children in the light.  Singing holy, holy light. 
[01:50:00]  I was feeling pretty good.  La, la, la, la, la.  Taking my time on the la, la, la, la.  Snow falling down in the la, la, la.  Everybody singing like la, la, la, la.  Taking on a heart with the la, la, la, la.  Ah, shut up.  I can't take it anymore.  God.  I enjoyed being told my father was dead more than this.  You're good at the sound of that.  What is wrong with you?  This is horrible.  It's not horrible. 
[01:50:30]  I like to sit out on the pier.  It's terrible.  It's really not.  It stinks.  Look across the bay of snow at your dutty.  That's why it's cool.  Go inside.  I hate this guy.  You don't like snow.  You don't like Christmas.  You don't like...  What if they put a swastik in the video?  Would you feel better?  No.  I'm just annoyed. 
[01:51:00]  This is annoying.  Six million in the la, la, la, la.  Night.  There you go.  Oh, shit.  There you go, man.  I actually like this song.  He doesn't have a worry in the world.  Because it's the Christmas season.  Ain't no water because it's la, la, la, la.  If I could have just saved for la, la, la, la.  The hands of small clean out the munitions.  I'm essential to the la, la, la, la, la.  I got one arm. 
[01:51:30]  I can't shovel.  La, la, la, la, la.  See?  You get it.  See?  You get it.  So you can pardon, pardon you.  I left a ring around the tub and la, la, la, la, la.  I shot in the back and la, la, la, la, la.  I wouldn't let them capture you for la, la, la, la.  I shoot you in the head.  Uh, shit.  You get it.  No.  Because you're using his concept.  No.  To do other things with it.  I'm using it as, as, as, you don't understand. 
[01:52:00]  La, la, la, la, la.  It brings a physical reaction.  Yeah.  I have a physical reaction.  That's why we need Lydia on the phone.  Why?  Hatred.  Why?  To this song.  See, you either, I understand not liking something, but the hatred part.  That's why we need Lydia today.  No, this.  See, to delve into this a little bit.  All right.  I'll tell you one other song I could think of in my entire fucking life.  That annoyed me.  This reaction?  That annoyed me this much just to hear it.  Wait, let me guess.  Christmas song?  No.  No.  Rock song?  Uh, no.  More of a, um. 
[01:52:30]  Novelty song?  Novelty song.  Okay.  Novelty song.  Old.  Not how you doing, meet the Mets?  No, no.  He's going old.  He's, he's, he, uh, I would go with the, uh, uh.  The Jaws song.  The Dickie, uh.  No, no.  The Jaws song is bad, but, but it doesn't.  The Jaws song is so bad and nostalgic enough where it's like.  Wait, I want to guess the novelty song.  Oh, that's terrible, but it's not, that gives an emotion to me of, of pure hatred.  It brings out hatred.  I understand not liking it.  I get that.  No, no.  It's what, it's beyond.  And that's fine. 
[01:53:00]  Beyond not liking it.  Because it's music taste.  That's fine.  Everyone has different tastes, but to have this reaction of hate, I don't get it.  And he goes, feeling pretty good, good, good, like his foot, feeling pretty good, and the  la la la.  You don't like that?  No!  I hate it.  All right, all right.  What's the other song you don't like?  Oh, my God.  Wait, I want to kind of guess, though.  Novelty from the 70s, obviously.  No, it goes back further.  Well, from the 60s.  I was a little, little kid, and used to fucking cry when this came on.  What subject?  Christmas?  No. 
[01:53:30]  What's this song?  The 60s.  I will never guess it.  It could be anything.  Hold on.  Let's give it, like, one more minute before we fail.  No.  Oh, wait.  Was it, um...  Yes, that was it.  I hated that one.  La la la.  La la.  Jimmy's ass opens and a la la la la.  It smells like Iraq's bra la la la la la.  60s novelty song.  Yeah.  I thought the novelty songs...  No, it wasn't Yellow Polka Dot Bikini.  Give me, uh...  It wasn't The Lion Sleeps Tonight.  All right, give me a, uh, a topic. 
[01:54:00]  Subject of the song.  I'll tell you something.  There was something personal in it that included me.  Ooh.  Anthony.  Yes, yes.  Child of an alcoholic, la la la la.  Spaghetti on the wall, la la la la.  Mom's yelling at the la la la la.  He's calling her a fucking la la la.  La la la la.  Was molested, but he can't remember, la la la.  Trying to make a puppet and a la la la la. 
[01:54:30]  They called a little faggot and a la la la la.  Was a sensitive kid and a la la la la.  Cryed all the time and it's la la la la.  A Mexican fucked his mouth in the bushes, la la la.  Fucked a big fatty on a horse, la la la.  Made believe he's sleeping in the tree for it because his friend wanted a la la la la.  His shoehorned lyrics into la la la.  A jeep, jeep, jeep, and a la la la la.  Can I suck your cock?  A jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep.  He eventually turned around and a la la la la la. 
[01:55:00]  We should die of AIDS and a la la la la.  Christy McNichol has a mullet la la.  It's not Alice's restaurant.  Nope.  Okay.  Is it, uh, they've come to take me away?  Ha ha.  No, why would that, uh, I, the clue I gave away, I gave away a good clue.  Anthony, I know, uh.  Now, Anthony is.  I know what it is.  No, you don't.  The name game.  Oh, you did know it. 
[01:55:30]  Motherfucker.  It's not Anthony, it's Tony.  Tony, Tony, by bony, banana, faddle.  I still, I still don't like it.  Thank you, Debbie.  Let's, uh, could we play that?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  There's a lot of songs you don't like.  Like, there's the only, there's only two songs you fucking get a reaction of hate.  Two songs that, yeah, hatred comes out when I hear it.  La, la, la, la, la.  When I hear it.  And it took 40 years to get your second one, and it's, and it's poor Sleeves.  Yes.  And he's just trying to make a living?  It's Sleeves.  I don't, oh, no. 
[01:56:00]  What do I hate this?  This is groovy, man.  And they would turn it up.  They would turn it up and make me cry.  They would turn it up.  Because the, the Tony part would turn it up.  They're going to turn it up.  Ha, ha, ha.  Yes.  He was a full thinking.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Come on, everybody.  Ha, ha, ha.  I say, now, let's play a game.  I betcha I could make a rhyme. 
[01:56:30]  Out of anybody's name.  Oh, that's good.  The first letter of the name.  I treat it like it wasn't there.  Ha, ha.  This sucks.  It really, like, because they would turn me up and, they would turn it up and taunt me.  What is the Tony part?  Oh, it comes up.  Hitler, Hitler, Bob Hitler.  Ha, ha, ha.  Fiddler.  Ha, ha, ha.  I've got the name again with an F-3 plane and a B-5.  Oh.  She's got to explain how it's done.  All right, we get it. 
[01:57:00]  Stop it.  Oh, no.  Here we go.  I think.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  All right.  But if the first two letters...  And they can never do fuck.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Then say the name like Bob.  Bob.  Where the fuck are you, Bob?  We're having problems, you asshole.  Pick up the phone, you incompetent, soon-to-be-fired motherfucker.  Get your head out of the sand, you idiot. 
[01:57:30]  Read the fucking contract so we know what's going on, Bob.  No.  Then banana family spoke.  Then you say the name again with an F-3 plane.  Then a B-5.  See, they used my, like, kind of my name to explain it, and it hurt me.  Why would it hurt me?  Here it goes.  Everybody do Tony.  No.  Tony, Tony, B-5.  Banana family spoke.  Tony, B-5, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe. 
[01:58:00]  I hate it.  Tony.  I hate it.  Let's do Billy.  Billy, Billy, Billy.  Billy, Billy, Billy.  Red hair and a fucked up childhood.  Ha, ha, ha.  Dang, Billy.  Let's do Bob.  Bob, Bob the slob.  Ha, ha, ha.  Fucking.  I really, I hate this.  Marsha.  Oh, Marsha.  A little trick with Nick.  Nick, Nick.  Oh, Big hates anything that's not white.  We really miss Nick.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  It's a name. 
[01:58:30]  Game.  Oh, gotta do a Bob Kelly, though.  All right.  Oh.  At least you're a little finking.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, people saying Sleeve sounds like Tom Waits.  How can you make that fucking voice, Anthony?  I don't like Tom Waits.  You don't like Tom Waits?  No.  What with you?  You don't like the fact that the Christmas song is, like, non-denominational and...  Yeah, groovy.  We get it.  Love all around.  Yeah.  Shut it.  Let's go to Ken in Montreal. 
[01:59:00]  Montreal.  Yo, buddy.  Kerbos, kerbos, bo-verbos, banana.  China, bo-verbos.  Richard Gere likes gerbos, gerbos.  Himla, himla, bo-bimla, bo-bamla.  Oh, who else was there?  Eva, Eva, Bo, Beva.  Danced in the Bunker.  Oh, you're going to...  Oh, boring.  Wait a minute.  Yes.  All right, Ken, what do you got?  I didn't want to step on the magic there.  Exactly.  You wouldn't need a big foot to do it.  I'm an asshole.  Thanks.  You could step on that magic with a gnat toe. 
[01:59:30]  All right, go ahead, boo.  Oh, my God.  I already brought it up, but Tom Waits has the same exact vocal quality as sleeve.  Like, it's the same feel to it.  That's terrible.  Tom Waits is a legend.  Patrice, Patrice, Bo-beast, banana-eating Patrice.  Oh, wow.  That is, you know, it's always got to come back to that, these fucking people.  Matt at Ohio.  Matt.  Hey, guys.  Just want to let you know, I kind of like that tune.  It seems to me like it's an apathetic view of Christmas that La La La could be replaced 
[02:00:00]  with...  That's true.  Fucking...  Wait, well, let him explain it.  Let him explain it.  Come on.  Matt, what?  This fucking explanation.  It seems to me that the Fa La La La could just be another way to say, you know, whatever.  Oh, really?  I was feeling pretty good in the Fa La La La.  What is that?  What is that?  What could that mean?  Go ahead.  Tell me.  Well, it's like I'm feeling pretty good.  Where?  Where?  Go ahead.  Use your mind, man.  Tell me what it means.  Look, look.  This guy's life in general sucks, but because of the holiday, he's able to forget all his problems 
[02:00:30]  and just enjoy the season.  Oh, so why is it a funeral dirge sounding song?  How about fucking an up-tempo number coming out of a goddamn Christmas song?  Yeah, I gotta have a dead dog Fa La La La.  What are those Fa La La La's I was supposed to say?  Guys, get Fa La La La's.  Don't make a fucking Fa La La La out of me.  I can't stop saying it.  Dude.  And he's just slowing down because he knows his problems are going to come back as soon  as the Christmas season's over.  Before the Christmas season, he gets to forget for a little while. 
[02:01:00]  That's all it's about.  You guys are getting way too deep into this.  That's all it's about.  Sleeves, not a deep guy.  Sorry.  Stop it.  And Coke Logic understood because he lives in a shitty little fucking shack.  Exactly.  Never leaves the house and La La La La.  All right, I like that part.  I don't know.  Even Coke Logic.  I've seen much better stuff out of him.  Now you're going at the Coke Logic video.  I did just one shot of the guy's fucking face.  He's a loner. 
[02:01:30]  I actually like that.  What?  The subject in the song is a loner and has a shitty life, but Christmas isn't going to  bring him down.  Where does it say that?  Christmas isn't going to bring him up.  Washington, D.C. going to burn in hell off.  Should we listen to it again?  No!  You want to hear it again?  I would say so.  No, I don't.  Now that I described.  Fuck.  Now that I explained the song.  That's true.  You did.  Now it's going to make a lot more sense.  I don't know.  He's just kicking back.  When he's sitting on that dock, he should fucking put a chain around his leg with a rock  on it.  I feel pretty good. 
[02:02:00]  La, la, la, la.  Taking my time on the la, la, la.  Taking his time on the la, la, la.  What's that mean?  Come on.  Use your minds, man.  He's taking his time.  On what?  He wants to just slow down and enjoy the fact that he has no worries in the world.  No.  No.  His home is in foreclosure, but it's Christmas.  I didn't hear that.  Me neither.  I didn't hear that part.  You can afford some beers.  Yeah, true.  Having a Bud Light.  Everyone can afford beers.  You know that. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Walks into town.  Yeah.  Like a million miles away.  What does that mean?  A million miles away from his problems.  Stop.  No.  I'm telling you.  Ow.  Oh, wait.  This guy's fucking in the trees?  Why?  Jerome in Florida is going to explain.  By the way, this is the exact same break we did last year.  Exactly.  We do this annually.  All right.  Turn this down for a second.  Jerome in Florida.  We have about 250 breaks. 
[02:03:00]  We just repeat one every day.  Jerome.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Happy birthday, James.  Hey.  I believe that it is a holiday season.  La, la, la, la.  Yeah.  That's the obvious part.  I don't get it.  It represents that.  Shut up.  This is.  No, no, no.  I'm not buying it.  Why the hatred?  It's a depressing.  Listen to me.  Why the hatred?  It's crazy.  It's.  Yeah.  Sleeves is a talent.  My God. 
[02:03:30]  He's an American treasure.  No, he's not.  Yes, he is.  I like to molest little.  La, la, la.  Oh, Uncle Lala.  Gina loves the song.  Let's see what Gina knows.  Gina.  Gina.  Yes.  Hey.  People want to know if you were an overweight kid, Anthony.  No.  I know.  Sorry.  That's pretty funny.  Skinny guy.  La, la, la, la.  Not you, Gina.  Jesus.  I think it's the same thing everybody else has, that the holidays suck for me, and I 
[02:04:00]  love hearing that song.  Why?  Because the holidays suck for you?  What sucks about it?  Yeah.  What sucks about it?  Yeah, go ahead.  I'm by myself.  My boyfriend left me, and my job sucks.  So, I like the song, and listening to you guys.  That's it.  All right.  Why'd he leave you?  See?  It proves it.  She likes, she's, she's fucking in a down-ass mood.  She don't want to hear happy shit, so she's listening to this fucking, bleh, bleh.  But Sleeves is also simplifying Christmas in general.  It's not, it's not about buying, and he just didn't- 
[02:04:30]  How, when did you find that?  I just visualized.  You are finding all kinds of hidden treasures in that song, aren't you?  Well, well, yeah.  No, there's nothing in there.  He's not talking about the commercialization of Christmas.  That's a lazy fucking song.  Back to the basics.  It's snow, it's Christmas lights, it's Christmas trees.  He didn't write words.  It's reflecting, it's forgetting about all the other shit going on in the world.  Do you know that whole song was just, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  And he wrote a few words, couldn't rhyme them, and left the la, la's where he couldn't fucking write. 
[02:05:00]  Uh-oh, breaking news.  Keith has something on Sleeves.  Keith.  What's it called?  I Christmas Thee.  I don't think I've heard this yet.  I Christmas Thee?  Do we have that, Travis?  Wait, wait, wait.  Start over.  Start over.  Right now.  What?  Does this guy have a merry fucking bone in his body? 
[02:05:30]  Do you hear that?  I Christmas Thee.  Do you like Leonard Cohen?  I do.  What?  All right.  Only when he's collapsing on stage.  Leonard Cohen doesn't sing happy songs for the most part.  They're all very...  He doesn't sing Christmas songs with that name.  They're kind of dark and...  What?  La, la, la, la, la.  All right, let's listen to this.  I Christmas Thee.  Christmas ain't a holiday, a decorated tree.  It ain't about branches or a special on TV. 
[02:06:00]  No.  Is a stand-in for another word.  You know this secretly.  I won't come out and say the word.  That's your discovery.  Now I'm with you. 
[02:06:30]  I don't like this one.  I don't mind this.  I don't hate it, but...  I like the la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la, la.  Yeah?  Pirates and sailors and those lost at sea.  What?  Cowboys and civilians drunkards, they're free.  Know what I mean and so I Christmas Thee.  Doctors and dentists, those lost in a dream. 
[02:07:00]  Fishermen bury them and crossing the stream.  Know what I mean and so I Christmas Thee.  Know what I mean and so I Christmas Thee.  I don't know what you mean.  What is I Christmas Thee?  You don't like that?  This word is secret.  You got another two minutes.  Holy shit.  Yeah, of course.  If you fucking bumped it up a couple of...  Play it fast.  Can you play it fast?  I'm, uh...  Play it in fast motion.  Play it even faster. 
[02:07:30]  No, that's as fast as it goes.  It's not really fast though.  It's kind of just up-pitched.  Yeah.  I'm with you on this one.  I want to hear it as the fucking chipmunks.  Now that would be good.  Robbers and brigands of skullduggery.  Oh, okay.  Criminals, vandals of darkness.  Alvin!  Know what I mean.  Alvin!  I like it now.  Tara, Mikey. 
[02:08:00]  Hey.  Aljo and Alice, hot top and...  Right?  Chapter and AJ, sponsor.  I might even like the La La La.  Play the La La La song fast.  Whoa, someone's saying the La La La La is crack.  Paul in Florida.  Paul.  Oh, stop.  Yes, you guys are completely missing the point.  It's not even a Christmas song.  He takes a lot of time on the La La La.  Kill yourself.  Kill yourself.  Kill yourself. 
[02:08:30]  All right, this guy's going to let you know what song's about it.  James in North Carolina.  James.  How's up, folks?  Hey.  If Anthony would listen to this program on Sunday, it was Sleeve's Christmas Story.  It was the La La La La was about his life.  Gives a shit about his life.  What do you mean?  Wait, he...  Wait, he actually...  Hold on.  Did Sleeve's actually explain the song on this channel?  Yeah, everything in the song was about his story.  The dancing on La La La La was his skin on the ice and all that. 
[02:09:00]  Who killed what this guy, Mr. Fucking Important?  Can we find the actual explanation from Sleeve's?  Sorry, Hemingway.  We're not interested.  Why are we trying to interpret it when the artists can interpret it for everybody else  and tell us exactly what he was doing at?  Is she smiling or frowning, La La?  What now?  I'm going to do it.  Thanks.  She's screaming on the bridge and La La La La.  The runaway runaway.  I want to hear it in fast motion.  Go ahead. 
[02:09:30]  I want to see if I like it any better.  Look, see, it's a little more festive.  Wait a minute.  I feel pretty good.  La La La La.  Taking my time on the La La La La.  Theodore!  Simon!  Alvin!  La La La.  Taking on a hardwood to La La La La.  Making my way to the La La La La La.  La La La La.  La La La La.  La La La La.  La La La La.  La La La La.  La La La La.  See, it sounds a little better.  I like to drink a little beer.  Yep.  At the end of the day. 
[02:10:00]  It sounds bright now.  Doesn't it sound bright?  This is happy.  I don't mind it now.  The best walking in the trees.  The people shouting in the street.  And the people in the light.  All the children in the light.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Holy night.  No.  It's, it's, it's, it's more happy.  I feel pretty good.  La La La La La.  Taking my time on the La La La. 
[02:10:30]  La La La La.  The snow falling down in the La La La La.  Everybody singing like La La La La.  Taking on a hardwood to La La La La.  I think we made our point.  All right.  I still don't like the words or anything, but it sounds happier that way.  But maybe after the break, we can get Sleeves explaining what the fuck he's singing about.  What?  Why not?  Oh, oh, good.  If he did it on our channel, we might as well hear it.  Yeah.  I got another Christmas song in front of me right here.  Which one?  Yeah.  This is, this is going to be a hit.  Is it, um...  Oh, this is...  Who did it?  This is going to be a hit. 
[02:11:00]  Who did it?  Pant legs?  Dan War...  No, that's pretty good.  Dan Warhead.  Turtle Ned.  What?  Dan Warhead.  Sleeves.  Sleeves.  Listen to Dan Warhead's Christmas song.  You're going to love this one.  Santa's got his big brown bag.  It's not what you make think.  It's not to hold and present it for hiding some young swing. 
[02:11:30]  Off they go with much glee to the men's men's stall.  The belt holds it steady so the lad won't fall.  You may think he's taking a break from a day of shopping.  He'll be full just like a dress while his pants are dropping.  It's a set of feet of seeing his cool dad's decision.  He's a lad that stands in the bag and makes the Kringle's at position.  And he's telling that he's coming down.  This is going great. 
[02:12:00]  It's a barrel, Kringle, Kringle.  You better run away.  The Kringle will stand you in the lad bag.  And that thing gets rid of your eggs.  The Kringle will stand you in the lad bag while I'm sitting on the toilet.  This is more perception so hard you don't spoil it.  When you're in the bad news fall you'll hear a slurping sound.  You'll make me have a nice pop.  What a joy that you get found.  Who goes round the park at night a jingle in his feet. 
[02:12:30]  Dance with any interest.  Feel beyond his knees.  Snack with the speed hookups.  Feels almost uncanny.  A shoehorn and everything.  But really it's a tranny.  Hi daddy.  The kid's lad tries to turn around.  Look at his feet and make a funny sound.  It's Kringle, Kringle, Kringle.  Who did this?  You better run away.  Dead warhead.  Stand you in the lad bag.  And then things get real gay.  Do you like it? 
[02:13:00]  It's terrible.  Do you hate it though?  It's not even like...  Like it's not trying to be good.  So...  Do you think it's funny though?  No.  You guys fucking hack.  Kringle, Kringle, Kringle.  God, how many fucking verses?  Stop.  Four minutes to go.  Oh, shut up. 
[02:13:30]  Just if you're a fan of the show and don't like certain words,  it doesn't mean it's funny to put it in a song.  File that thing.  Thank you.  There it goes.  Oh, what a waste of a disc.  We're going to go to break.  We're going to break.  What do they find?  Like a penny each?  Just so much hard work.  Fuck him.  What a waste of a disc.  They could have been used to a much better thing. 
[02:14:00]  They could have been.  There it goes flying across the room.  The guy works hours on that.  Come on.  Yeah, he's a fan.  Thank you.  Guys, thank you, Dan Warren.  He gave us a little laugh.  All right, thanks.  All right.  Did you have a little laugh of it at least?  Not a one.  Not a piece of one.  It's just a fucking douchebag, man.  Oh, no, that piece of thing got me all fucking agitated.  You didn't get any, like.  Look, my shoulders are up.  You're just the worst.  I'm actually sitting with my shoulders up.  I'm all tense.  La, la, la, la.  My final statement is simple.  I understand if you don't like it, but the hatred is just, I don't get it. 
[02:14:30]  To have hatred over someone's song.  I know, but it really brings a physical, like, pain to me.  Like, it's physical, not just mental.  I don't think there's a song out there where I would fucking feel hate.  I think it's lovely, Gregory.  You do, Ted.  I certainly do.  You like the la, la, la, la?  I certainly do.  I have an emporium.  La, la, la, la.  I sell extra lyrics in a la, la, la, la.  You should have bought some.  I sure should have.  What does the la, la, la, la mean to you, Ted?  I don't know.  It means something. 
[02:15:00]  Well, what?  It means I have hats and false teeth.  I'm feeling pretty good with my hats and false teeth.  Put in your own words, Gregory.  That's what I always do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm tired of hearing that fucking explanation, by the way.  That, no, man, it's like, you just come up with your own, like, no.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  I think he's...  He's lazy.  That's just more of a feeling he was going for.  Hey, we're going to go to break with a little Guess the Sound.  We haven't done Guess the Sound in a while. 
[02:15:30]  We're going to try to figure out what this is after the break.  We're going to try to figure out what this is after the break.  Kenny's sleeping. 
[02:16:00]  We've all seen Kenny do that.  Oh, fuck.  We'll let you know next  Sleeves 4th of July song  Jesus  Leave the guy alone  Terrible  Is he bothered that Dan hates him?  Oh  His feelings have to be hurt  I don't know  Fuck him  It's just the hatred  I can't understand it  I love everything on Rana Fez's show  Except Sleeves  Jesus  That's harsh  He might hurt Mr. Killings though  Yeah I would think so  He's making me hurt  What about Ding Fries Are Done  I love that one  Oh now there's a fun song 
[02:16:30]  How about we play that going into break  It is the Christmas season  Certainly is  Little Ding Fries Are Done  We'll do this as we go to break  And we'll tell you what the  I guess the sound thing is  And also Victoria's  Was that sound  Was that overlaid anything?  Or was that just  I don't think so  No that was  That's a single sound  That is a single sound  Holy motherfucker  I have no idea  And it's not a sleeping thing?  No  Yeah I don't think so  That's why I just want to  Make sure people know  It's not a sleeping thing 
[02:17:00]  It's a cat being fingered  You wish  Wow  Well we'll tell you after the break  But first I think we got  Ding Fries Are Done  Hit it  Nice  I love that one  Back with the O.B. and Anthony show  Quickly  Does anybody out there  Radio Land  Have tickets to the  Islanders  Rangers game  At Madison Square Garden  Tonight?  I bet somebody does  I asked this fine company  That we work for  Sirius XM  But it's complicated  I just want to go to  A hockey game tonight  It's complicated 
[02:17:30]  It's complicated  I guess they want me to appear  On the NHL network  Which I would love to do  Sure  I can talk hockey  Yes indeed  But they said  You show up there  You do some radio  With those guys  And then that'll lead to  Tickets eventually  I want to go to  Tonight's game  First of all  And second of all  We talk hockey  On our own show  So we're already  Promoting the NHL  And then you can hear  A lot of games here  At Sirius XM  It's a big thing man  Rangers Islanders tonight  And then Rangers Islanders 
[02:18:00]  Tomorrow night  But I got tickets to that one  Because I got season tickets  Oh so you want to go  To both games?  It's like a home and home  Series they call it  Anthony  So one is at the  Gaden  And one's at the  Coliseum  I got the Coliseum  Tickets covered  I got those  Why do you want to go  To the Garden?  Because I live here  Yeah but I mean  It's easy  A subway  I'm down there  I check out some hockey  You know something  I didn't even think of that  I'm just thinking of  Where I live  I know  I live here  I'm like why would you  Want to do that?  It's pretty close  Honestly it's more  Of a pain in the ass  To go out to the  Coliseum for me 
[02:18:30]  Of course it is  It's a two hour ride  Even though it should be  A 20-30 minute ride  I wasn't even thinking that  You kidding me?  I could just relax  And jump on a subway  Be at the Garden  In 10 minutes  And watch some hockey  Yeah that's why  Alright that makes  Perfect sense  Hold on this guy  James on Long Island  James?  James?  James whatever  I don't fucking care  Yeah my dad's actually  Got two tickets  He's trying to sell them  But I don't know  Alright  Where are the  Trying to sell them  But I don't know  Hold on  That's definite  Anthony understand  I'm very picky  With my stuff 
[02:19:00]  And we're going to get  Into how picky I am  In a second  Because we got wine  In front of us  Oh boy  But my tickets  Need to be  Where the Islanders  Shoot twice  First of all  Boo  If your tickets  Are where the Islanders  Only shoot once  Then I don't even  Want to talk to you  What a prick  What a prick  And I have to be  At least halfway down  I'm not picky  As far as that goes  But halfway down  I need at least  Half the fucking  Fans to be behind me  That's not asking for much  It's not halfway down 
[02:19:30]  It's like  300  You're the last row  All the way to the top  Goodbye  Goodbye  Later for you  Someone's saying  Just buy tickets  400 fucking dollars  For two tickets  What?  400 and how much?  50?  450?  When I could do  A little plug holder  Or pay holder  Why would I spend  The money?  Oh Christ  Oof  That's the joke  It's a little joke  It's a little joke  Humor  It's a little joke 
[02:20:00]  The cheapest ticket  At the Garden  Is 68.50  The most expensive ticket  Is 11.29.50  $11.29  No  $1,000  50 more cents  That's $11.00  I'm saying it  As you were saying it  They actually got tickets  For $1,100  $1,129.50  For one ticket?  Where do you sit?  On the goalie's lap?  I don't know  What the fuck is that?  $8.79.50  $2.75.50  $2.50  $2.50  $1.50  It's a hockey game  Exactly  $1.95.50 
[02:20:30]  Where the tickets  Where's section 318  Because someone's offering me  Their 318 seats  318  That's  That's  You should  That's where the farmers sit  That's where the farmers sit  I'm not sitting with farmers  What are you even calling?  Yeah, he's a fancy man  Yeah, what  Ron, why are you calling  If you sit at 318, really?  Let's be honest with each other  They're really good seats  No, we're looking at  The friggin' chart  In the garden right now  They stank on ice  All right, hold on  318 isn't that bad  What's the section behind that? 
[02:21:00]  It goes up to 400s?  That's bad  All the way up in the top  Oh, really?  Dude, that's bad  Wait, are you low 3?  We're on the aisle  You sit with your feet  Out in the aisle  Okay  You've got full leg room  I like that  Great beauty ice  $62 a piece  What row?  $62  Row J, it's the last row  You've got nobody behind you  Last row?  Ah, nobody behind you  What does that matter?  Are you going to turn around  And try to watch the game?  And do you watch  Do you see reclining?  How about no one in front of you  Is the goal here? 
[02:21:30]  And do I watch the Rangers  Shoot at that goal twice  Or the Islanders  Shoot at that goal twice?  The end of the Rangers  Shoot twice  Goodbye  Hopefully they shoot a lot  Goodbye  Later for you  Good luck selling your  Shooting tickets  He didn't even listen  I have demands  It has to be where  The fucking Islanders  Shoot twice  Why don't they just  Give you tickets here?  What?  Why don't they just  Give you tickets here?  I asked  And I asked a while ago  Because everything has to be  You know what?  I'm not trying to be  The fucking  Debbie Downer today  So I'll just shut my mouth  But everything is complicated  Around here  That's the headline

[02:36:30]  Four minutes  Is an average  For an American male  Jesus  Is that  Is that  Average  Guy that  Hasn't  Gotten rid of the poison  In a while  Well  It's probably  An average guy  Who's been married  For like  A while  Well no  Here's the question  I am getting to some  So if it's  The average is four minutes  But let's say the guy  Now has  Sex  A second time  How long  Is it  How's average then  Usually people  Do last longer  The second time  No I know that  But I  You know what  I honestly don't know 
[02:37:00]  How they collected  That statistic  How they measured it  I  Whether they ask  The guys  Or the wives  I'm not sure  But that's the statistic  Keeps popping up  I gotta go  Stacy  I gotta go  So you say  Men come in less than  Four minutes  And women need  Eight to ten minutes  Of thrust  To have an orgasm  Yeah on average  So there is a gap  That's not  Yeah there's a gap  A big one  And if it's half the time  She's halfway there  And you're done  Yeah  How awful is that  You gonna start the car  Back up  So she  So should you just 
[02:37:30]  Finger pop her  For four minutes  Well you can do  Fingers  You can do  Vibrators  Various sorts  You could add oral  You could do  Different things  You don't like oral  I mean  There's different techniques  I'll fucking lick an ass  Like a madman  Are you kidding  You'll get right in there  Right  Oh I don't care  Like I've always said  Tailbone to belly button  I'm in  You like your ass licked  Sure  Who doesn't  Those who

[02:38:30]  No  I don't think I'm a fool  I'm supposed to say that  Condoms are for fags  Yeah  Attaboy  That old Tiger Woods  Didn't believe in him either  No  That's a guy who likes  To fucking risk  That's a guy who likes  To compete  Oh yeah  Yeah what do you got  On Tiger Woods there  Dr. Z  What do I got on him  Yeah what do you think  What do you think  Of the whole thing  Did you fuck him  First of all  No  I didn't  So you ever meet him  I never met him  I guess the big question  Whether he has a sexual addiction  I've been on a bunch of 
[02:39:00]  TV stations  No he doesn't  Covering that  And what I said  Is that  They're confusing addiction  With overindulgence  I don't think that he is addicted  I just think he's  Rich  And he likes  He's narcissistic  And he likes  Instant gratification  And he has opportunity  And access  So I don't think  He's addicted  We took a sex quiz  Yesterday though  His wife looks  A little frigid  To me though  Really  There's something  About her  That's  She's a model  Yeah I don't know  She's beautiful  That's not the issue  She's not sexy  Something  She's not sexy 
[02:39:30]  I'm saying the same  That you are  As a model  I don't think  That they are  I think women  That beautiful  Sometimes don't have  To work in bed  So a lot of them  Tend to be  Fucking horrible fucks  They just kind of  Lay there  And want to look  Pretty and smile  And they suck  Yeah I just  Maybe  So she should have  Licked tiger's ass  Yeah she should have  Just been more passionate  After like a fucking round  Yeah after winning  The British Open  She should have  Got right in there  Oh god  Well he still  Had the green jacket on  Maybe at least  Giving him a good  Prostating exam

[02:40:30]  Which is  Protected here  On satellite radio  Indecency  Which if you  Commit indecency  On regular radio  You get an FCC fine  Indecency is allowed here  Obscenity isn't allowed  On any type of medium  Right  Really  Technically  But there has not been  An obscenity  Fucking case  Sam go get more info  That has ever been  Brought against  A fucking radio station  Or anything  I know my FCC rules  I know all my rules  There's never been  An obscenity 
[02:41:00]  Especially when a doctor  Is doing a prostate exam  You're not gonna get  An obscenity  Fucking  Rap on that  Just stop already  We had Dr. Steve  Shoving fingers up  Homeless guys  Of course  Checking their prostate  So you know  It's a bit  We've done already  I wanna know  What the fuck  Where that  Where that  And this is why  I won't go  I won't go for  20-30 minutes  But this is why  We have rookies  Around us  What is he  Talking about  That's a rookie  Fucking statement

[02:43:30]  Obscene with who  Meaning a person  No obscene with who  A person listening  Could file  An obscenity complaint  Not an FCC violation  It would be with the government  And then  Right  We'd be in trouble  Those are all  Boy you hear about those  All the time  Really brother  I don't  Everyone is calling  Saying their local  Fucking show does it  On regular radio  Here's what it is  Oh my gosh  If we had people  Come in here  And start fisting each other  In Roman orgy fashion  And describing it  In graphic detail  Believe me  I would love it 
[02:44:00]  I'm all for it  I think it's great  But in  And we described it  In graphic detail  And perhaps there were  Pictures and things  Then maybe  There'd be grounds  For some kind of obscenity  But to have a doctor  Administer a prostate exam  To somebody  Is the furthest thing  From obscenity  It's not even indecency  You could do it  On regular radio  As long as it's described  In a medical fashion  This is  This is  You know  I'm a student  Of FCC law 
[02:44:30]  And government  Obscenity laws  Yes this is  Obscenity law  It was made clear  To be not  FCC law  I understand  I know both  Okay  Does the rookie  Understand that  Is regular radio  Doing this  All over the fucking place  I'm going to say  That I don't know  Who you mean by the rookie  Because that would be  Your terminology for him  But I could ask  Our legal liaison  If he knows that  Basically hired a guy  To make sure  It's really hard  To do a radio show

[02:47:00]  You have to  Well yeah  I mean we're talking  There's some trickery  You got to know trickery  To last  Median average here  So obviously  There's some  Premature ejaculators  There's some  With the delayed  Ejaculation  We like to call it  Cumzies  Cumzies  Cumzies in your pants  Making cumzies  And now this one  Women  Many women  Prefers shallow penetrations  To deep thrusts  That's true  Yes  Now what if you  Mix it up a little bit  It's always good to make  You like  You like that  You like to make a surprise  Like  Ding ding ding ding  Ding  Oh  And then they get  Like  Oh  But you got to

[02:48:00]  That you did it  Yeah  Just cause you know  You kind of fuck it  You hit her back  Yeah  Hit her sparring  Can't go to school  The next day  Jesus  Why  It could be college  Exactly  Alright  Good point  No it couldn't be  Any girl that fucks you  Is too dumb to go to college  Believe me  Same for me  What do you teach people  On this DVD  Fucking  No but how do you  Here's the thing  This is true  Cause Voss comes quick  How do you teach somebody  To not come quick  If they come quick  Voss comes quick  He's legendary 
[02:48:30]  As a quick shooter  He hates himself  Wow  For real  Everybody can  You know anybody  Can train themselves  To last longer  And I talk about it  A little bit  In the video  About this  And the main thing  Is your masturbatory style  Will translate  In intercourse  So guys  Who have like  Okay I have three seconds  Right now  So I have time  To jerk off  Cause I have three seconds  So they do it  Fast and hard  And dry  That doesn't translate  Well in intercourse  So what you gotta do  Is you gotta train yourself  During masturbation  Lots of lube  Take your time  Build up arousal 
[02:49:00]  Bring it up  Then let it  Let the arousal subside  And that's what  Actually I've interviewed  Porn stars  And that's what  A lot of them do  In their spare time  They just sit there  Masturbating  Taking their time  To build things up  Okay  So learning  To identify  Your point  Of ejaculatory  Inevitability  So getting to the point  Where you know  It's gonna  You're about to  Explode  But then  You know  Allowing the arousal  To subside  Then back up  But you know  What do you do  During that time  You know  You're fucking  You feel like 
[02:49:30]  Uh oh  Here it comes  And then  What do you do  You just gotta go  Hey hold on a minute  I'm just gonna  Sit here like a statue  No no  You can go down on her  You can play with her nipples  Exactly  Lots of things you could do  Meanwhile  Yes yes  So when you're feeling  You're getting close  You know  Then you focus on something else  Or you could just  Come and apologize  I'm so sorry  Or you just change the subject  Like as you're getting close  You're about to come  Just pull out  And go  How about them Mets  Right  You hear about the trades  So uh 
[02:50:00]  All right  But here  So yeah  But I talk about  What I do  I talk about  Different sizes  Because you know what  This video is structured  According to the letters  That I receive  So I take real letters  And I answer real letters  And then the videos  Cut through  To illustrate the letters  And one of the main  Concerns that guys  Have is size  You know  I'd say about  60% of letters  I receive  Is like  How do I make myself bigger  I'm not big enough  So I talk about  Different sizes  In different positions  That work best  For each size 
[02:50:30]  Oh  And then the actors  Demonstrate them  Little tiny cock  What are they  What's position  Should they  Well  One of the  Like  On the stool  With a rope  Missionary style  With the legs  All the way in the back  Or doggy style  So we talk about  Let me think  Missionary style  With the legs  All the way back  All the way back  So you see  Gymnose  That's because  That's so you can fool her  Into thinking  You're fucking well  As your weight collapses  And you're hurting her  Like back  Leg  And she's going  Ow  And you're like  Yeah  Or doggy  Now that seems 
[02:51:00]  Doggy seems a little  Rough because  You know  You gotta have a little bit  Of length  To get in there  Not really  With doggy  You can manipulate  Doggy allows for  Pretty deep penetration  And that's also  So you can't see her  Laughing in your face  As you vainly attempt  To hurt her vagina  With your fucking  Minuscule penis  Little pinky dick  What about  Big fat cock  Now what do you do  Oh well  I talk here  Obviously woman on top  Is great for this  Because she can  Herself  Regulate  How deep 
[02:51:30]  Or decide  How much is going in  Yeah decide  How much is going in  So she doesn't feel threatened  And like  Oh my god  I can't take this  What is it when you take  Too long to come  Like a lot of times  I can't come  Like I'll fuck for a while  And I get close  But then I'm like  I can't go over the edge  And it's not about  Fucking  Because then I just lose it  Like after a while  I'll just lose it  Without coming  What do you do to  Normally what you've got to do  For some people  Is adding additional stimulation  Maybe playing with your nipples  That's what I mean  Or you know  Prostate stimulation  Whatever it takes  To put it over the edge  You have to figure out 
[02:52:00]  For some people  You know  A penis ring works  A vibrating penis ring  To put it over the edge  That just looks silly  It does look silly  You can get those  At Steven Singer  That's why I hear  The  You can get them  At penthousestore.com  Sorry  Where?  Penthousestore.com  There's plenty of those  Oh you guys are in trouble  They're one shot  They're one shot  I love those  You just throw them away afterwards  Because I  You know  The worst thing about sex toys  Is cleaning them after  Who wants to clean them?

[02:54:00]  And then  Everybody  Believes it  And that's it  They're telling us  We can do fake radio  What?  Yes  Fear of the mind  Would imply that  Yes  It's just sort of  Painting a picture  For the listeners at home  Because I mean  We are on the radio  Can I have some on hold music please?

Something like Bach  Beethoven  What's wrong with you?  I mean something  This is a function  Well whatever  It's with a Russian accent  Beethoven  It's called on hold music  Beethoven  It's just on hold music  It's our classic on hold music  I know I know  But make it at least  Something stimulating  Something inspiring  Nah it's gotta be like  Elevator type music  Hold music  It's gotta be lousy 
[02:56:00]  That's how it is  Every time you're on hold  You haven't been on hold  And gone wow  This is fucking  This rock  Yeah  No never  You never listen to Bach  Beethoven  Beethoven  Beethoven  I'd rather listen to Bach  And Beethoven  Beethoven  What's our  What's a really unsexy thing  Hold on  We have to talk about  What we just  So the lawyers said  We could make believe  We're doing it  Yeah  Yeah  At first they said  We couldn't even make believe  We couldn't even like  Actually act out  And actually not do it  But act it out  And through our talents  Of acting  Make it seem like 
[02:56:30]  We're doing it  But we're working with people  That find it acceptable  To do fake radio  Like to make  Yeah  Yeah  Where am I  Um  Just remember that  Don't go home  No  Oh  Don't go home  With  Mope  Mope  Just remember that  They think it's acceptable  To do fake radio  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  And they don't understand  Where our frustration  We just don't  Um  Look  If we can't do it  We can't do it  But we're 
[02:57:00]  Absolutely not doing  Um  Fake  We're not going to do fake  Uh  Radio  And do that  Nope  But what we can do  In it's place  Opie  Is to get in a big dirigible  And start dropping  Fucking bra bombs  On those people  I understand  But that's also  15 years ago  I'm kidding  That's what I mean  Yeah  Sam  Jesus  That was it  Fake radio  That was  That's what they came back with  That was the offer  Fake radio  There's no  No insertion  Yeah  No insertion  But the guy said  Look  The good news about me  Is I

[02:59:00]  Yeah  Yeah  Theater of the mind  Is not fun  No  Especially with face sitting  No  It shouldn't be  Then again face sitting  Is not fun for the radio listeners either  It shouldn't be suggested  Fun for me  Theater of the mind  It shouldn't be suggested  That's ridiculous  Theater of the mind  Is fun when like  Dead Ronald Reagan  Used to make a phone call  Right  I think people understood  Dead Ronald Reagan  Wasn't really calling  Yes  So you act it out  And have some fun with it  But something like a prostate exam  If we're going to say  We're doing it 
[02:59:30]  And to not do it  Puts us in that  Category of radio personalities  That we're really  You know  It's just  It's not  It's not real  It's not funny  It's not fun  It's stupid  Well you just have to start  That Proctober months  If we start Proctober  And maybe get some sponsors  Yeah  Then I think  I'll be more than allowed  Yeah  Make a fist  Run at them  That's it  Get some  Get some pharmaceutical companies  To sponsor it  With big bucks  Maybe if we can get  A car company

[03:02:30]  A bumpy surface  Oh yeah  Yeah  Obviously if she's more aroused  It's easier to find  Yeah  So first  Go down on her first  When she's nice and wet  Then that's  That's a good time  To find a  When you feel around in there  And it usually  She'll get wet  Usually  And then right when you find it  Do you yell out  I got it  Yeah  That's sexy  Get ready to cum  Toots  That's the Grafenberg spot  I got the Grafenberg spot  I got the Grafenberg spot  You get the extra  Points for the

[03:03:30]  Come here  In my hand  Yeah  This is a play on words  But I didn't know for years  A lot of guys finger  But you just jam your fingers in  And go straight  A lot of guys  Do that  That actually does nothing  High school  Yeah  That does nothing  That's chewing a high kid  Just  Put a finger popping  A lot of guys  Just jam the fingers in  And pull them out  Yeah  And they don't know  To curl the fingers up  No they're afraid  Of hurting somebody  Yeah  You girls are pretty  Durable in there  Oh yeah  Durable  That was a good one  That was a good one 
[03:04:00]  What did I say  So do you like  How do you find  Humiliating people in bed  Do you like that  I don't mean that  In a bad way either  It's part of role play  Sure  It could be a lot of fun  I'm a big believer  In role play  I think otherwise  Sex life gets boring  You gotta change it up  A little humiliation  What kind of role play though  Yeah  Humiliation  No I'm talking about  A little domination  A little bondage  It's always good  Even for vanilla people  It always seems so hacky  It's like  Oh tie me up  To the bed  And you're like  Well I'm tied  Ooh  Ooh I'm in danger now 
[03:04:30]  So hacky sex  No no but  You don't have to do that  You can just sort of  Pin her hands down  I mean that's kind of nice  Fucking choke a bitch  A little choking  Yeah  Not strong but  No I mean  Fucking choke a bitch  No  A little domination  Is good  Some women like that  It goes both ways  And some guys like that  It's nice to switch it up  I like the hair  I like  I don't like  Some girls go  You know  I like to have my hair pulled  Yeah  And I don't  I don't like pulling it hard  But sometimes I want it pulled harder  And then it's like 
[03:05:00]  Alright  Maybe you're feeling good about this  But I'm kind of feeling  Not good about this  You gotta grab it  Right behind the back of the head  And just fucking wrap it  In your fist  That's why you're not  Pulling it from  You know  Five inches back  Pulling her scalp  Off her fucking  Mayan  Jim likes his hair pulled  I do  Yeah he likes it  Literally pulled  I'm actually very dominant  I mean I'm very very rarely  Submissive  Occasionally I like to go  Submissive just to break it up  But I tend to be  Everything you talk about  Sexually is submissive  But I really  Even when I'm being pissed on  I don't feel like 
[03:05:30]  Oh I'm a naughty  Submissive  It's not  It's fetish  I'm dirty  No I don't feel ashamed of it  If you ask any common Joe  If a girl pissing on a guy's face  Makes the girl or the guy  Dominant in that  Everyone would say  It makes the girl dominant  It all depends on  Whose limits you're pushing  I mean  It doesn't matter  Which way you're laying on the floor  Like I like to choke  I don't like to be choked  I like to choke  I like to slap  You know  And I kind of like  Getting slapped a little bit  But it's very rare  What about defecation  Well please  What about it  That's 400  We all know that 
[03:06:00]  I mean  You know come on  If you have to plan a day in advance  You have to say  Look make sure you eat properly  That's not what I'm saying  You still don't feel submissive  When the girl is doing it for you  I don't want any shit  I don't want to shit on somebody  That's gross  I've pissed on girls before  But I just like  I like getting it  More than I like giving it  Because it doesn't do anything  For me to give it  Yeah  No because nothing's happening  I'm just standing over here whizzing  I would rather  But what if she digs it a whole bunch  Like you  I'll do it  Like when she pisses on you  Yeah  It's probably not like  Oh wow I'm really getting off on this 
[03:06:30]  She's probably just like  Oh I'm taking a piss  And you're like  Ha ha ha  Ha ha  Well what if the chick likes it  And you piss on her  You know  Would you do that  I sure would  Right after eating asparagus  I'd really straighten her fucking  Fix her wagon  You'll never ask for this again  Will you  Yeah no no  It's just that  I don't think it's a submissive thing  No  I find that strange  But  A lot of people would agree  Like it's a very domination thing  But to me it's like  If someone's got a pussy in your mouth  And they're pissing  It's not  They're doing what I want them to do  Yeah but so is somebody 
[03:07:00]  That's being whipped  Yeah it's true  Yeah slaves are all topping from the bottom  I mean that's the whole thing  You're fulfilling their desires  Yeah I mean I guess so  In a way serving their desires  So it's  When you look at it like that  I guess so  But I don't  Like the rest of the thing for me  Unless it's  If it's not a session  If it's actually like a real sexual experience  The rest of the thing is like  You know  Alright it pisses on me  It pisses on my mouth  And then I'm back to slapping  And choking  And doing  It's just part of what I like  So what do you think about that?  Do you find it  I find it  I think it's good  I think all role play is good  A little dressing up 
[03:07:30]  A little  That's silly  Pretend make believe  That's all good  That's silly  I never role play per se though  Like I'm going to be  Alright I'll be  I'll be the milkman  And you'll be the lady  Role play  Well I mean  What about like a French maid outfit  Her cleaning your house  That's kind of sexy  You know when  That's really sexy  When the fucking outfit comes off  I like naked  No I don't  I like an outfit  Naked naked naked  I like an outfit  Really?  Yeah weird outfit though  I wanted to dress  What about Bill Cox's outfit?

[03:09:30]  Let's go to Cell Medic  Cell Medic  What do you got for Dr. Z  Hey how you doing Dr. Z  Merry Christmas  And happy boobalicious New Year  Well thank you  That's a nice greeting  Who's been listening to our show  Well thank you  I have a question  What are your thoughts  On piercings  Specifically cock piercings  Female genitalia  Tickercings  I'm not opposed to them  I think they  For a lot of people  They heighten sensitivity  Actually my sister 
[03:10:00]  Has had her clit pierced  And she loves it  She said she likes  The stimulation  When she walks around  So I hear it  You know  She's a big fan of it  Is your sister hot  She's very hot  When you're walking around  Have you ever been  Hotter  Have you ever been  With a male  Dr. Z  No I have never  Personally been  With a male  Who has piercings  But I assume  That it's probably  You know  Probably adds  A certain thrill  I mean  Are you pierced  That's pain  Yeah he's pierced  That's why  Crazy 
[03:10:30]  What do you got  Cell medic  Prince Albert  No not a prince Albert  I have a  A frenum  And I had a lorem  But I just recently  Took the lorem out  It's part of a  We don't know what that is  Dr. Z  It's part of a  Jacob's ladder  It's on the underside  Of the shaft  The frenum  Is the top ladder  Or the top rung  The lorem  It's very sensitive  You're an angry man  You gotta be an angry man  You hate your cock  You hate it  You hate your cock  Put a clip on  Put a clip on 
[03:11:00]  I like grandma  Being in the medical field  I did it years  Trying to figure out  What piercing  I was gonna get  And doing the  Rejection rate  That the body  Was rejected  Or which one  Was the most  Safest to get  Prince Albert  Is the most  Famously known  For it's name  But from what I understand  It really hurts females  Because it punches  The cervix  A lot of guys  End up taking it off  It's also  Anyway  The one that I've got 
[03:11:30]  It's probably been  The most pleasurable one  You get the girl  Into a doggy position  And you can rock  That G-spot  G-spot  Right  That's what I was thinking  I was visualizing  That's what he's got  Oh yeah  You can sit there  We're looking at  A picture of that  Well that's a  Prince Albert  He has  No he's got him  Going this way  On the bottom  Of his shaft  Yeah like a ladder  Oh Jacob's Ladder  Yeah no it sounds  Exciting  Like I said  I have not had  Personal experience  But  What do you think  Of the guys  That split their cuck  Oh  No I don't know 
[03:12:00]  I wouldn't mess with that  Exactly  That's a Jacob's Ladder  Why would you do that  I don't know  You know some people  You know are into  Body modification  That makes me hurt  For psychological reasons  I mean that's  No no no  I'm telling you  Every girl that I have  Been with  I've had to fucking  Beat them off  With a stick  I am not  I am not  No I couldn't see why  It would add stimulation  Absolutely  I mean if  If you're  Up for  I mean some people  Can handle  The pain better  I mean  Did you feel 
[03:12:30]  It didn't hurt  It didn't hurt much  Oh stop it  No it did not hurt at all  And that was my  Midlife crisis  And yet  It changed my  Sex life dramatically  Interesting  Can I ask you a question sir  Had you been  A chronic  No lube  Masturbator  Who had lost  Some sensitivity  Which is why  It didn't hurt going in  Uh  No  I had been a  Like Tiger Woods  Fucking sex fiend  And I sort of  Became one  Even more after that  Had you lost  I mean before  You got your piercings  You hadn't lost  Sensitivity at all  Yeah 
[03:13:00]  No I didn't  And that's why  It took me a year  To decide which one  Did I want to get done  Because I was  I'm a big  I'm a big  Wimped pain  I'm like  Did you have  Lidocaine  I mean did you  Have anesthetic  When you did it  Or  No  I've got a video  Somewhere on one of my  Hard drives of it  And you  It just  It was like a  It's like somebody  Just pinching your  The underside of it  And then bam  It's over with  There was no  It's done  Alright  Let me get Melissa  On the phone here 
[03:13:30]  She's got  Alright  You could have stayed  But let's go to Melissa  She's got the female  Perspective on this thing  Melissa  Your husband has a  Prince Albert  Yes he did have one  When I first met him  When we were in college  And I just want to say  There's not much difference  To be honest with you  From a female  Can I ask you a question  Do you have a Prince Albert  In your mouth  I was going to say  Have you ever been  Having anal sex  And the phone rang  And they said  Yeah Prince Albert  Can  Thank you  I  Nigh  Wait what were you saying 
[03:14:00]  No I was just going to say  When it was fixed  For a female  It doesn't make much difference  No  And he didn't  He didn't seem  Too faced by it either  So  Okay  I mean some people  Just get turned on  By the piercing itself  I mean I don't know  It's the same thing  With the tongue piercing  I've been with a few women  With pierced tongues  And I can't say  That they're necessarily  That much better at all  I got one hole in my dick  Right at the tip  That was given to me by God  You tell them  That's the way it stays  You tell them 
[03:14:30]  That's the way it stays  So you didn't like  The Prince Albert there  Melissa  No  No it didn't  It didn't make a difference  So he got rid of it  The only thing you need  For oral sex  That's good  You don't need a tongue ring  You just need a very wet mouth  If you're a woman  Blowing a guy  A tongue ring doesn't do  Anything for me  No  Let's go to Heather Height  She's always good  For one of these  Heather Height  What do you got today  Hey guys  How you doing  Good evening  Hello  I as we all know  Have been using a strap on  On my boyfriend  Yeah she's a dirty girl  This Heather Height  As we all know 
[03:15:00]  Sounds sexy  We all know  What I want to know  Is my goal  Is to get him  To ejaculate  Just by stimulating  His prostate  Is this a possibility  Is this a real thing  With a jackhammer  No for some men  It is again  It varies  From guy to guy  Some men  Will ejaculate  Just from prostate stimulation  And some say  It's amazing  Others feel like  They need  Simultaneous penile stimulation  So again  It varies  Same thing  As like  Some guys 
[03:15:30]  Can orgasm  From oral sex  And some  Still require  Like hand stimulation  Or additional stimulation  So I guess  It depends on  But keep on trying  I would think  It is probably  A possibility  I'd love to  Be able to  Think myself  Into coming  Just like  Think yourself  Think about  You know  Hotness  Things like that  And just  Be able to shoot  Without even touching yourself  Be amazing  Well if you go without sex  For a few years  Abstinence will do that to you 
[03:16:00]  You'll get to the point  Where just thinking about it  Yeah  Wet dreams  Wet dreams  Yeah  So what do we have  For Heather Height  No I'm just saying  That there is  I can't say that he will  Or he won't  If he's enjoying it  There's a good chance  Some men do  And some don't  It's the same thing  No way  Is there any particular  Like position  Or method  Obviously  Pressing down  Down stimulation  Is more pleasurable  For most guys  Than upward stimulation  What are these guys  Watching at the same time 
[03:16:30]  Huge penis  Jesus  Some guy with a big mule  Is just ejaculating  Can you turn it this way  The guy actually came  Without  Without  Stimulation  He did do a little move though  He did kind of  Well in this case  I think what he did  Is he has  A lot of guys  Are able to train  Their pelvic muscles  And they're able  To stimulate themselves  I know if you guys  Have you ever seen  Puppetry of the penis  Yes  It plays off Broadway  These guys are incredible  Their muscles  Are so well trained  They can literally 
[03:17:00]  Retrag the penis  Inside the cavity  And back  So with  There's a  If you train  Your pelvic muscles  Sufficiently  You can  You can orgasm  Fucking guys  But his pubic hair  Is awful  He has a tough  To fucking  Red pubes  Terrible pubes  Shave it idiot  He's able to come  Without touching himself  So yeah  With  Heather's boyfriend  I would say  Also if he doesn't  Orgasm for a few days  The longer he goes  The more frustration  Is built  The more likely  He's to orgasm  From prostate stimulation 
[03:17:30]  I don't want to  Maybe she needs  To use something  Bigger or something  Exactly  Get a black one  No I don't know  I mean obviously  You don't want to  Get to the point  Where it's painful  Or uncomfortable  Fucking use your fist  Yeah  Get in there  Degrade him a little  Call him a bitch  Do you call him a bitch?  Only for my own thrill  I think he just indulges me  And I don't think  He's into being called a bitch  That can be kind of hot  Yeah  Yeah  But he lets me  Call him a bitch  Just you know  Because I like to  Alright Heather

Uh  Just driving down the road  Right on  You got Dr. Z  What's your question?  Yeah Dr. Z  Uh  I just wondered  If you had any information  On e-stemming  What is it again?  E-stemming  With uh  Electrolysis  Like a TENS unit  And electric pads 
[03:19:00]  Using that  Stimulation with um  Uh  You know  I personally  Never  I've never tried it  I know that for  A lot of people  But what is he talking  Electric shock  In yourself  It's very  Yeah the stimulation  With TENS unit  Some people  Uh  Get  You know  They do enjoy  I mean there's a couple  Of ways  Some people  Will use it on the legs  First  To build up arousal  And some people  Like direct genital  Stimulation  I've never personally  Tried it  So I can't  I can't  Um  Tell you 
[03:19:30]  Any particular  Technique or anything  Ow  Do you like having  Your dick slapped  I've gotten my dick  Slapped a little bit  Which is kind of hot  Oh no  Danny found  Sir  No Jimmy  Just uh  You tie the  Electrode around your dick  You know  And then you just  Turn it on  A little bit  There's no reason  For that sir  It's very light  And kind of ticklish  At the beginning  Obviously  So  And then you turn  That shit up  Right  Yeah  Your face is on fire  On top of a train  In India  Yeah  He must have had  A great orgasm  As he was dying though  An anal probe 
[03:20:00]  That's hooked up  With electronic  And if you can get it  Right on the prostate  That you can get  What they call  A ghost fuck  Sir  I don't want to use  Anything on my dick  That is actually  Part of legal executions  In Florida  I'm actually watching  This on your computer  Oh god  At the same time  Hey uh  Hey doc  Did you say  Public muscles  Public muscles  Pelvic  Someone said  You said  Public muscles  No  No  No  And who's the  Who's the classic musician  You like  Classical 
[03:20:30]  Beethoven  Beethoven  Beethoven  Beethoven  Beethoven  Beethoven  I like Mozart  Let's say how to  Louis in Medford  Louis  Hey Louis  Oh my god  They're shocking  This guy's a dick  With a paddle prod  To fuck you up to Louis  Hey uh  I got a question  For Dr. Z  Yes  This girl  I've been seeing  She's kind of like  My girlfriend  She wants to  Stimulate my prostate  And she doesn't know  How to do it at all  Is there any tips  Yeah sure 
[03:21:00]  I mean the first thing  I would do  Is I would  Get her gloves  Latex gloves  And then use  Lots and lots of lube  Because it's not  Going to feel good  Can I slow you down again  It goes back to  The silly factor  What's that  All of a sudden  Your girl's got  Latex gloves on  Yeah I would do that  For the first time  Because some girls  Have nails  And some girls  Will feel uncomfortable  It's really true  But now you're  In the silly zone  It's just all silly  No I would do that  Especially at the beginning  When you're just  Exploring that  You don't know  How it's going to feel 
[03:21:30]  Especially if she has  Sharp nails  Put the gloves on  So she doesn't look  Like she reached  Into her purse  And there was a  Melted Hershey's kiss  In there  Yes that's another one  You don't want her  Pulling out and going  Oh I got all this stuff  Under my nails  That's what faucets are for  But I would do it  That way for the beginning  And slowly inserted  Obviously  And I would combine it  With other stimulation  So that it's kind of  A little jerking off  A little jerking off  And I  Obviously most guys  Enjoy the pressing down  Downward action 
[03:22:00]  More than upward  But yeah I mean  That's really all  You got to do  But I would recommend  The gloves first  Because I know  A lot of women  Who freak out  Because it just feels weird  Or something  I'm feeling something  Strange in there  Dumb idea  I get very self-conscious  When I'm having my  Even if my ass is immaculate  I'm hyper  Yeah that's what I'm saying  So some guys just  Won't feel comfortable  Of course  I would recommend  That you wash it beforehand  With some soap and water  Shower  And stick your own finger  And clean it up  Really nice  So you don't have to worry 
[03:22:30]  About her getting grossed out  This guy's electrocuting  His dick now  Oh guys  You're pulling out  Some disturbing images there  That's a guy  Who has a fucking  Healthy sexual outlook  Yeah  His dick looks like  That Faces of Death video  Of that fucking  Faked electrocution  I wish it was like  The Green Mile  And he forgot to  Wet the sponge  And his dick  Just catches on fire  Alright we're gonna  We're gonna go to  Rick in California  We're gonna talk to  Hey Rich  Dr. Z  Guide to Great Sex  On DVD  Rick what do you got? 
[03:23:00]  Yeah Dr. Z  How can a guy  Get more volume  When he comes?  Well I know  This question comes up  Well first of all  Your fluid intake  Has a lot to do  It is to drink  A lot of water  Beforehand  And the other thing  Is the more  The longer you go  Between ejaculations  Obviously  The greater your volume  Will be  And the more aroused  You are  The greater your volume  Will be  So obviously  Have her build up  Arousal for a while  Build it up  And also tease you 
[03:23:30]  The longer you are aroused  The greater the ejaculate  Will be as well  I want it to look like  A civil rights fire hose  What do you think?  How much water  Do I have to drink for that?  A few gallons  People flying across the room  What's that?  Any vitamins  In that area?  Oh vitamins  I don't  I've never actually  I've not read anything  About the vitamins  I know it's really fluid  I don't know  I don't know  That the vitamins  Would really make a difference  I'm sure they'll sell you  Just about anything  Just drink a lot of water 
[03:24:00]  And wait a month  You'll have a nice load  All right  Let's go to Ben  In PA  Yeah  My wife  She'll humiliate my prostate  And it's great  But a lot of it  Is what she has to say  While she's doing it  That adds to a lot of it  Yeah  Like what does she say to you?  Does she humiliate you  Or call you a bitch?  Or what is it?  No  She usually pats me  On the back of the head  And tells me  I'm a good little altar boy  Really? 
[03:24:30]  It's exciting  No way  No  What does she say to you?  What does she say?  I'm dirty  Or she'll say  She'll say that I'm a good  Little Cub Scout  Or something like that  Are you kidding her now?  Of course  What's your trigger  For real?  She'll just like  Do it real slow  And say you know  Do you like that?  And does that feel better?  And then  I don't know  It's just  Once she talks  It's just like  Ten times better  Well is she degrading you  Or is she being very loving  And nurturing?  Kind of loving 
[03:25:00]  But it's like  It's like you have to  A little patronizing  At the same time  She's like  In total control  Yeah  And you have no control  Over me  She's like  In total control  So it's  I'm gonna make you  Come so good  Just wait  Till I stick my finger  All the way in  It's gonna feel amazing  I like that  But I ruin every mood though  I ruin every  Every time there's a finger in me  I wreck it  Like it starts getting  Really sexy  And I break the mood  By going  I have to shit  I have to shit  I have to shit  I have to shit  Stop letting me up 
[03:25:30]  Let me up  Let me up  Sorry for everything  Swoogie's got a great question  I've never heard before  On our show  And this is a good one  Go ahead Swoogie  Hey Dr. Z  Why does sex feel so good  Right after a hangover  Like the next morning  It doesn't feel good for me  I got a major migraine  The next morning  I'll answer that  It takes your mind  Off the hangover  While you're having sex  It does seem to be a little better though  You think so huh  Yeah  Even Laney's saying  Yeah  Hangover sex  What is that about 
[03:26:00]  Maybe something to do  With the endorphin release  Because there's  I mean  You're also very relaxed  When you're hungover  Kind of completely  No tension whatsoever  So maybe it has to do  With just ultimate  You don't have an answer  You know what  I'm not a big drinker  They finally stopped you  I really don't know  They finally stopped you  Dr. Z  I have to tell you the truth  I don't remember last time  When I had a hangover  That's why I look so good  Why do you think  I look so good  Healthy lifestyle  I don't drink alcohol 
[03:26:30]  You gave it a shot  You really don't drink at all  No not anymore  I'm into this  I'm on this like  The whole anti-aging campaign  So I can't drink anymore  You do look  Better than last time  You didn't look great last time  But you do actually look  Your skin glows  You look great  Usually though  You don't want to stop drinking  You want the men  To drink more  Then you'll look better  This is boring  That's usually what it is  There's your anti-aging  Right there  Anti-aging  Anti-aging  I don't know  Because I have an experience  That the few times 
[03:27:00]  I've had hungover sex  Why don't you want to age  Why don't you want to age  Because I know what you're going to do  And you're going to  Don't stop  Just  I mean stop  Just stop  You look good right now  Because the women  They keep doing the Botox  And the lips  And shit  And you look ridiculous  I'm not talking about that  I mean obviously  You can get a ton  Of plastic surgery  I'm really talking  About healthy living  Because I want to  I want to remain vibrant  And healthy  And active  You know  Into my  You know  I want to live  A hundred and more 
[03:27:30]  And I want to be  An active person  So I'm more into  Like the real health movement  I'm eating healthy  I'm working out every day  The looks too  But the looks too  I think  You know  Actually the latest research  Shows that people  Who look younger  Actually are younger  Their health  Health wise  All the tests come back  So our health  Reflects on our face  Sure  Right  So yeah  So I haven't been  I don't remember  The last time  When I got drunk  To tell you  So I really can't tell you  Why it feels good  Is sperm good for the face? 
[03:28:00]  No  You know  That comes up a lot  I actually researched  That many times  And there is  It's not bad  But it's not like  There's nothing  Wonderful about it  I mean it has like  Vitamins and protein  But the thing is  That it won't cross  The skin barrier  So  So  No  But  However  There is research  That shows  That when guys  Ejaculate  Women whose guys  Ejaculate inside of them  Have fewer incidents 
[03:28:30]  Of depression  So there is something  That has  Hormonal regulating  Effect  So it's good  It's good inside  Let's just say  Put it that way  So good for swallowing  And coming inside  But isn't it nature too  Like they're probably  Less depressed  Because as women  It's the instinct  To want to come inside  So they feel like  They're getting  Like they're  Instinctively  Your purpose  Is being fulfilled  And they're taking your cum  It's not psychological  It's a hormonal issue  Somehow the  The factors 
[03:29:00]  In the ejaculate  Regulate  Female hormones  And her moods  And so forth  So it is good for you  However  On the face  It won't penetrate  The skin barrier  So we'll do anything  For your face  Gotta get them in the eyes  In the eyes  That's right in there  So literally  If your girl is depressed  You should say  I'll cheer you up  And you put a load in her  Right  Absolutely  The other thing  I did also  Saw this study  Where women  Who had difficulty  Getting pregnant 
[03:29:30]  One of the ways  To  They had some sort  Of allergy  To the sperm  Where the  The bodies  Were rejecting the sperm  That after they  Engaged in swallowing  Their allergy lifted  So they were able  To get pregnant  Easier  After  Injecting  Ingesting sperm  It's an allegoracy  So it's somehow  Aided in the fertility  That I had read before  That's not good  One more call  And then we're out of here 
[03:30:00]  Hey Dr. Z  We got a dribbler on the line  Help him out  Oscar  Yeah Dr. Z  I got a question for you  Yes  When I shoot a load  It kind of just  Blurks out  Real thick  And straight  Blurka blurka  Yeah  Well  It might be dehydrated  Yeah that does sound  Like you need to drink  More if it comes out  And  Blurkers  But you know what  I tell guys  That most of the time  You know  The guys will like  Write me these long letters 
[03:30:30]  Describing  Oh well  My sperm  Comes out like this  And it looks a little  Greenish  And it has this and that  And I tell them  Fine  Don't obsess so much  Chances are  There's absolutely  Nothing wrong  With your sperm  I got green sperm  There's a fucking problem  That's gotta be a problem  Stop eating Christmas cookies  But you know  Guys obsess too much  Over the way it comes out  As women  We couldn't care less  Which way it comes out  And what it looks like  To tell you the truth  Just drink lots of fluids  Eat a lot of pineapple  And lots of fruits 
[03:31:00]  So it'll taste better  And there's all the risk to it  And you're fine  Is this normal  When I come  It comes out really slow  And then it creeps down  The back of my dick  Like a slinky  That's impossible  I'd like to see that  Yeah it's really slow  And creepy  Let's observe that  For clinical evaluation  I'm a fucking shooter  Yeah  Yeah  You gotta time  You gotta time  Your contraction right  Yep  You gotta time that shit right  And you gotta hold back 
[03:31:30]  As long as you can  You gotta like  And then bam  Yes that helps as well  Like it's a frustration  Building a little frustration  If I don't come  For a few days though  It's thick  And it doesn't do that  It's like  It's weird  It's like  If I come the day before  And I hold out  For a while that day  Then it's like  And it's really shoot  But if I  Why do you guys  Study a sperm  Way too much  That's all I think about  You gotta  My goal is to  Make myself a sperm hat  Why don't you just  Examine it under  The microscope  To see
