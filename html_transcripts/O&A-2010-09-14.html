<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts complaining about technical issues and Opie’s broken camera.  This segued into a lengthy rant about perceived unfair treatment by Sirius XM, comparing their workload and compensation unfavorably to that of Eminem, Oprah Winfrey, Rosie O’Donnell, and other less active, higher-paid personalities. They highlighted the lavish treatment received by celebrities while complaining about their own lack of resources, even mentioning the absence of coat racks in their studio.  A phone call from a station employee amplified their complaints about excessive live reads. The conversation veered into discussions of a sports reporter’s attire, a celebrity's ashes, and a Jay-Z and Eminem concert attended by colleague Sam, further fueling their grievances about inequitable treatment within Sirius XM.  The segment concluded with a detailed, albeit crude, description of the concert experience.  Offensive language and crude humor were prevalent throughout.

The show continued with a discussion of a female sports reporter's attire and the ensuing catcalls from football players, leading to a debate about the appropriateness of such comments and the reporter’s perceived responsibility.  This sparked discussion of double standards between male and female reporters.  The hosts played and discussed the music of Biggie Smalls, comparing his style to other artists, and briefly mentioned Eminem's radio show. A phone call from someone claiming to be Dougie Fresh occurred, followed by commentary on colleague E-Rock's weight and eating habits. The conversation then shifted to Lady Gaga's meat dress, prompting further off-color jokes and tangents. The segment ended with a teaser for the upcoming appearance of comedian Bill Burr. Offensive language and sexually suggestive topics were frequent throughout.


Comedian Bill Burr joined the show, launching into a musical tribute to Patrick Swayze, followed by discussion of Burr's new Comedy Central special, "Let It Go."  The conversation then devolved into vulgar and offensive commentary on a female celebrity's appearance, expanding to critique Fiona Apple and Sinead O'Connor in similarly offensive terms. A substantial portion focused on a recurring bit involving listener-submitted, often offensive, "happy birthday" messages to local news stations.  The hosts and Burr reacted with amusement to the newscasters’ unwitting broadcast of these messages.  The discussion moved to the New York Jets, Rex Ryan, Michael Vick, and Denard Robinson, with extensive use of offensive language.  The show concluded with a discussion about the size of college football stadiums, punctuated by vulgar comments, and a return to the “happy birthday” messages bit.  The segment was rife with offensive language and vulgar commentary.

A significant portion of the following segment was dedicated to a rambling, vulgar discussion about defecation. Opie, Anthony, Bill Burr, and a caller, Brother Joe, shared graphic anecdotes about their bowel movements in various public and unconventional settings.  This was interspersed with a brief, tangential discussion of imagination, a parody of a Disney Imagineers' commercial, and a discussion of a hot sports reporter. The latter part of the segment included discussion of Oprah Winfrey and a promotional stunt involving a trip to Australia with John Travolta, along with commentary on old Hollywood films and actors.  Bill Burr and Brother Joe were the only notable guests in this segment.

The final segment started with vulgar commentary on a photo of Miss America 1935, Henrietta.  This transitioned into a critique of modern plastic surgery, particularly "duck lips,"  using derogatory terms. The conversation turned to the New York Jets, followed by an introduction of Bill Burr and promotion of his Comedy Central special.  A discussion of a "To Catch a Predator" clip ensued,  with highly offensive language used to describe the participant and situation, expanding into a broader discussion about child molesters. The segment concluded with continued crude jokes, including a discussion of an encounter with a listener named “Uncle Paul,” and a commercial for Carbonite, where the hosts maintained their vulgar commentary.  The segment was heavily laden with profane and offensive language throughout.

[00:05:00]  they're penny pinching the hell out of us and then they pay this guy a shitload of money to not  even show up the guy doesn't even know this channel exists i don't think he'll be in today  no of course fucking not and the guy's in new york for a couple days yeah he's gonna get up early  and i know because that things are happening here i know the company's trying to save money  stop at the horse shit i'm speaking for myself stop at the horse shit the horse shit and the horse  shit is this shade 45 is well established right now does very well for serious xm stop with paying

[00:35:30]  upset why because no one's looked at her mother's face of course goodness gracious no one has pinched  her hiney or throwing a jock strap jock strap at her ever how much radio does martha stewart uh do  before we get into this it's a few hours it's gotta be a few hours a year that's how she dresses and  she and she's bitching that guys are looking at her this is that mexican reporter that ass  ass for days look at her and she's pissed off shut it how much how much money is series xm

[00:36:30]  the uh yeah the day the day uh we weren't allowed to look at oprah i realized my place in this whole  business oh i realized that way way before that that's true emerald lagasi come in for his cooking  show that guy's good on the radio they pay a guy to cook to say radio to say bam and you get mad  these guys get mad at us when we look at a video and describe it could you imagine  fucking listening to some guy cooking omelet yes holy shit you know something danny can't find when 
[00:37:00]  she's on and for how long because the company probably doesn't even know they just signed the  name and said whenever you can make it yeah it looks like she just does ask martha right which  looks like it's a one hour that's more about how much we are looking at the bank we are looking at a  grid of what would you ask her we're looking at a grid of the martha stewart channel right now  we can't find her name you know how you yeah you fill in where you're gonna work yeah we can't  find her what are your own channel because she doesn't do morning living live how do you keep 
[00:37:30]  your pussy clean in the joint so it looks like the only thing she does is uh ask martha live which is  a one hour show a one hour one hour a day a day no well it looks like from where oh she must  have a shitty agent if she has to work one hour a day oh that's crazy everyone else works one hour  every year slave driving that one wow she's not doing it apparently she has an isdn at her place so  she could of course of course there you go those those are pretty expensive i'm surprised she's footing 
[00:38:00]  the bill for that just to broadcast here i don't think she is dude that probably oh literal james  of course literal jim is actually a show on the wellness channel yes what is the wellness  channel doing right now did we find out it's not a channel it's wellness radio you're right you did  see what are the names of some of the shows on it on stars i know wellness radio i think wellness  radio is just him he's the whole oh okay it's his name is show but i'm sure he has guests on you 
[00:38:30]  know they talk about like yoga pilates yes here's wellness here's ted bickram he invented a certain  type of yogurt yoga yoga or yogurt it's all about wellness i like to sweat a lot deepak  regular yoga didn't do it for me that would be entertaining though there's a problem there it sure would  250 degrees in here i'm doing the downward dog my testicles smell like onions 
[00:39:00]  uh whatever what do we know apparently nothing obviously  uh yeah we and we're not even asking for anything outrageous oh that's the headline today trust me on  that we definitely trust me on that we definitely have to get into that um that mexican girl's ass 
[00:39:30]  all right why don't we take a break we got a coffee mexican girl's ass yeah because that's  going to be some hot radio man yeah no surprise here we don't see it like the like uh the mainstream  media oh of course well we'll tell you you know what it's all about really you know the  fucking all the guys on uh all these local news channels can make believe that's an outrage really  it's outrageous that a woman should be treated in this day and age like that is um half these guys except  for the gay weatherman would put their nose right in that juicy hiney even the gay weatherman would 
[00:40:00]  after a full day of work out on the field exactly because there might be shit in there oh you never  know probably is they gotta show their fake outrage on tv today oh they have to work with these holes  that's why they sit and sit there and listen to these fucking broads day in day out and pretend  they're interesting oh let's get into this next man yeah and we go back in history the female  reporter in the locker room so it all started with the patriots if you don't if you remember  fantastic so help me out boston by the way i'm a little fucking edgy today because my stupid jets 
[00:40:30]  lost a fucking game last night hurts doesn't it ten nine ten fucking nine what they what happened  they lost no but what they the the thing didn't happen just three field goals the thing there was a  thing where do they get a touchdown and a safety i don't know what i can have ten nine that is an  odd where they get two touchdowns and get back five and i think they had like 40 and i think they had  like 40 penalties it was just what's the flags all day all day long i used that one already so i 
[00:41:00]  had to stop yeah yeah i love that one all day long what what danny three field goals yeah just three  field goals yeah what's worse than a monday night football game with three  fucking field goals what are you doing just take the field goals out of football who'd they lose to  ravens ravens 10-9 that's an exciting monday night game 
[00:41:30]  i'm embarrassed by my tweet now because the jets lost i said my team rules and your team drools  did you know it rhymed or was it like accidental gift  fuck stupid jets we were supposed to have the super team this year we had big hbo i'll take the  soup yeah we had the reality show oh no that's an old joke hey man your cowboys how about your 
[00:42:00]  cowboys you want to talk fucking teams jimmy it was it wasn't much better for your cowboys it was  so enraging and then somebody i think actually had that guy first of all he'd be he didn't block the  fucking guy right but had he not just choked the guy roma would have gotten sacked i mean i i do think  that right but how about if you block the motherfucker right yeah right and roma you know he did a little  scrambling and and that touchdown and i had a moment of ecstasy because it was at zero and they  it's uh just put the ball in and i'm like oh my god but i knew yeah and that fucking referee and 
[00:42:30]  i knew it had to be offensive holding yeah they gotta get rid of the holding call too half the  holding this one was deserved though he literally was yeah the obvious holding calls of course but  some of these calls you're like really they show the replay like what come on yeah holding stop  already he literally had him from the back with his arm around his neck like i actually threw a flag in my  living room no it was just a little yellow thing i wear when i want to get pissed on and cruising 
[00:43:00]  i just like to watch  come up with uniforms where you can't hold anything right make them real  and a vaseline something they have to be nude yeah the seals against the otters  slippery came right there sure is oh the john sterling call yeah we'll do that after the break danny  it needs some special it is fat it is juicy it is her big fat mexican rump  oh yeah we'll be talking about that next that piece of ass 
[00:43:30]  poor susan susan wallman god bless her yeah i'll get all the people put bowling balls in her wig  when she leaves it upside down i think it's a bowling ball carrier or a netting i think it's a hammock  her fucking hairdo sucks she's awful oh she's terrible  pasada's not looking at me she's actually puts on a horse mask hoping a bat gets shoved up her ass now  yeah all right we'll take a break yes i gotta 
[00:44:00]  the  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  Oh, I want you to get to the party 
[00:44:30]  I ain't no, no, no  Candlebox, right?  Is that Candlebox?  Why would...  Wasn't everything set nice  and then Mars adjusts everything  so now we've got to readjust again.  Stop!  Readjust.  Readjust your headphones.  How's it sound?  Fine by me.  It's okay, but we got past the initial  this is different than yesterday.  I just got to turn it up a little bit.  Mars is what you call a boob. 
[00:45:00]  He does a good job, actually.  El boobo.  Whatever.  Hey, what happened a year ago today?  One year ago today.  We made love for the first time.  I'm going to show you how fast a year goes.  I would say...  A year ago, today.  We lost Patrick Swayze.  You heard it on the way in today, huh?  That's a year ago?  I actually read dumb Travis' fucking email.  He sends out emails?  Yeah, I know.  What's his email address?  I've probably been to my spam folder. 
[00:45:30]  F-A-G.  You don't get his email?  I didn't know he had an email address.  Send it to your spam folder.  Yeah, that's my thing.  Spam it, Gmail.  Gmail.  No, I read his email.  Yeah, I get T-Dogs.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Okay.  Patrick Swayze died a year ago?  That was a year ago?  Yeah.  Wow.  A year ago.  Oh, boy.  Speaking of like the wind, where were those ashes scattered?  Oh, boy.  We've got to go full retard, though. 
[00:46:00]  Into break in honor of Patrick Swayze dying.  All right.  Thumbs up from Travis.  He knows.  Oh, we love to you.  See, I can't hear this version.  I need the retard.  She picks up the girl as she runs towards him in the finale, and his pancreas falls out  his asshole.  Oh, there it is.  She runs at him with a fucking, with like an IV thing.  With a needle on it. 
[00:46:30]  No one puts my ill-fitting clothes in the corner.  Get it?  Because they're too big.  He lost a lot of pounds.  Poor Patrick Swayze.  God bless you.  We'll play the retard version of this going into break.  If you've never heard it, it's terrific.  Fantastic.  Anthony, we also are getting more info on the Eminem thing.  Don't you know that?  Shade 45, Eminem's channel that he doesn't have to actually do broadcast for.  Right.  Or he does. 
[00:47:00]  What is it again?  Six hours a year we heard?  Six hours a year, dude.  Inside Source gave us the fact that he does six hours of radio a year.  How do you get up for that?  For a channel that is named after him.  Like, oh, you wake up and go, oh, God.  I've got to do one of my hours?  What month is it?  He's actually on every day.  They just break it up.  He's on from 6 till 6.04.  I would love to have to set my alarm for April.  It's a tough one.  Better get to sleep early tonight.  Exactly.  Just don't stay up too late in March. 
[00:47:30]  We know we have easy gigs.  Yeah.  I didn't know it could get a lot easier.  Amazing.  We could actually get paid to do nothing.  Amazing how easy it could get.  But we found out that Shade 45 broadcasted backstage at the Eminem show.  Oh, did they?  But did they have Eminem on the channel is what I want to know.  Yeah, because that's the big thing.  Because then it would be even worse.  What do you mean?  If they broadcast from backstage and didn't get Eminem on the show. 
[00:48:00]  On his own channel.  That's worse than them broadcasting from the studio and Eminem not coming in.  Yes.  Because, I mean, then it's just a matter of, can we get Eminem for his own channel?  They actually brought his channel to him.  To him.  And if they didn't have him sit down and talk to him, that's a disgrace.  Sam's moseying down the hall.  I wonder if he knows anything about this.  He is moseying.  Look, it's very, look at those feet.  Mad Magazine feet.  Those feet are enraging. 
[00:48:30]  Just big.  I want to tie his feet together like socks.  Sam.  Damn, you walk like a penguin.  You went to the Jay-Z Eminem show last night?  Yes, it was incredible.  What was Eminem's opening song?  One of the new ones off his new album.  Oh, that's always great when they do that.  Yeah, thanks for that.  Open up with a new song.  Yeah, he did a lot off recovery.  Did the crowd like him?  Yes, they were very fond of him.  But let's be honest, New York is Jay-Z's town.  I don't know Jay-Z's stuff, though.  Oh, my God.  How about New York?  Yeah.  Let's. 
[00:49:00]  There were a lot of celebrities there, so I'm assuming that Eminem will be booking them  for his shows.  Oh, wow.  His radio shows.  How easy would it be for him to just go, hey, come on my show?  Because Eminem was able to bring out Dr. Dre and 50 Cent.  So all these guys are going to be doing his channel today.  Dr. Dre.  Listen to this.  Wow.  Also backstage, because Jay-Z brought them out, was Kanye West.  That's not what I look like.  That's exactly what I look like.  It's a Mad Magazine creep.  It was a Don Martin cartoon.  Yeah.  Kanye West.  Bitch-ass motherfucker. 
[00:49:30]  Sorry.  Who came up with this one?  This is great.  Mad Magazine.  Yeah.  As far as it looking like Sam, though.  It totally looks like Sam.  Oh, my gosh.  I did.  Yes, Sam.  We had Kanye West.  Yeah.  Nicki Minaj.  Yeah.  Who's that?  Drake.  Nicki Minaj is the hottest female rapper in the game.  Motherfucker Drake?  Yeah.  Fucking motherfucker Drake.  Motherfucker Drake.  Gotta love the Drake.  Drake's very popular.  Chris Martin from Coldplay.  Where was CeeLo?  Did they clap politely for him?  Who was he? 
[00:50:00]  No, they were-  Coldplay.  No, but I mean for Jay-Z.  Oh.  Jay-Z is actually friends with Chris Martin and has incorporated Chris Martin into a lot  of his stuff.  I know.  Ripped off fucking Coldplay.  No, he didn't rip-  He was performing with them.  He was performing with them.  He was performing with them.  Kanye West and Jay-Z have both done songs with Chris Martin, so they're bringing their-  You know, that's where hip-hop is going.  They're branching out.  Are they paying the Bungles or the Buggles or whatever the hell the name is?  Remember Video Kill the Radio Star?  Yes.  Some rap artist.  That's Nicki's new song, Nicki Minaj and Will.i.am. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, really?  Nicki Minaj, motherfucker.  Is the Buggles getting money for that?  Because they're ripping off the whole fucking song.  They got it.  Yeah.  Why can't they write their own music there, Sam?  Oh, come on.  What do they call it?  Borrowing?  Sampling?  It's not-  He's ripping them off.  You pay-  I understand Led Zeppelin ripped off the black man, but the black man is now ripping off  all these artists that haven't seen a dime for their songs in years.  No, because the black man pays for the songs, and Led Zeppelin just stole them.  Have you heard Video Kill the Radio Star?  Yeah, it's now the internet killed the what? 
[00:51:00]  I think it's-  What is it?  Do you have that, Travis?  The internet killed the video star?  Will.i.am.  It's called Check It Out.  Oh, yeah.  Sounds like-  When does it kick into rap mode?  Nikki gets on it.  It's gotta be right now.  Right now.  Here it comes.  One, two, three, four.  Yeah, yo.  It's all auto-tune, though.  It's auto-tune, and it's someone else's music. 
[00:51:30]  Why is she famous?  What is she doing in this song that's important?  Well, this song is-  I hear the bungles of the bungles.  Sounds like Lady Gaga through the auto-tuner.  If you want to hear a good Nicki Minaj verse, you would have to listen to Shakin' It For Daddy by Robin Thicke, featuring Nicki Minaj.  Featuring.  She hasn't even come out with an album yet.  She's a big star.  Oh, good for her.  How much is Sirius XM paying her?  I don't think they're paying her yet, but-  I'm sure they're already paying her. 
[00:52:00]  Her album drops.  With the hope that she might do an hour of radio every once in a while.  Her album drops on Pink Friday, so she'll be huge at that point.  Drops.  What's a Pink Friday?  It's like Black Friday, except since Nicki Minaj is dropping her album, now it's Pink Friday.  Oh.  In November?  Yes, November 20th.  Can you be a popular album?  Very popular.  Hall in North Carolina?  The promo for the Shade 45 broadcasting at Eminem's show last night ran on 202, which is this fine channel.  Or 197, depending on how you listen to us. 
[00:52:30]  And the promo announcer even said, and I quote,  And if we're lucky, we might even have a quick interview with Eminem after his show.  How does that have to be luck?  It's his channel.  He doesn't like doing a lot of press.  Press?  He's getting paid for a channel.  Right.  And if we're lucky?  He doesn't like doing interviews.  But it's his channel.  Huh?  Holy mother of gods. 
[00:53:00]  And if we're lucky, Eminem will do us a favor and actually talk on his own channel.  Wow.  If we're lucky.  Check it out.  Okay, we get it.  It's a good song.  I mean, it's decent.  Not a good song.  This is horrible.  It's horrible auto-tuning.  I'm not a fan of the sampling there.  It's terrible, dude.  Sambo.  Not a fan.  And not Matt's song.  That Oh Wow Oh is so annoying over and over again.  I mean, it's not my favorite song by Nicki Minaj.  This is not a good one. 
[00:53:30]  Rap used to be fucking Big Daddy Kane, who I took my name from.  Oh, yeah.  Could rap his balls off without auto-tuning.  Eminem fucking raps without auto-tuning.  Nicki Minaj can rap without auto-tuning.  Maybe.  Pull the phone because T-Storm has the promo.  T-Sol, what do you got?  T-Sol.  All right.  Turn this horse shit off.  Hey, T-Square, play it.  That's unfair.  What?  T-Bone.  He was kidding.  No, we had it, but they changed it in profit.  In profit? 
[00:54:00]  In profit.  That's one of the systems.  Where they changed it to, we weren't lucky enough to get Eminem to talk on his own channel.  Some college sports.  It's still labeled that, though.  If we're lucky.  Yeah.  If we're lucky.  Beyonce was there, too.  Imagine if we ran a promo, and if you guys are lucky, Open Anthony will actually do a show  for their channel today.  I love that the system's called profit.  It's the only profit this place knows is the system that holds the music.  I don't know about that.  So did they get the big interview? 
[00:54:30]  I haven't looked at the books, I'm assuming.  That I don't know.  Because, again, he doesn't like doing interviews, and he had a very busy night.  He had his whole set, and then he also joined Jay-Z to perform the song Renegade.  What's Renegade?  Well, it's the song.  No, no, no, no.  Oh, I thought it was the classic Styx song Renegade.  I'm sure that's coming soon.  Dennis DeYoung fucking comes out in a white robe.  Bleeding from the ears.  Yes, and the asshole.  They sing, Babe, I'm leaving. 
[00:55:00]  The crowd riots.  Is he allergic to sound or light?  Pussy.  Isn't one of these guys allergic to light or something?  He had to stop performing.  Which guy was that?  No guy that I know.  It was a rock guy.  It was fucking Van.  That dude, Van.  It might be Dennis DeYoung, all of a sudden got allergic to light.  Yeah, yeah.  After all those years on a stage.  It was him a big headache.  Van couldn't do it.  T-Storm now does have it.  Here's the promo that ran on our channel.  Hey, yo, this is Eminem.  I'm not afraid.  Eminem and Jay-Z's home and home concert series is coming to New York City's Yankee Stadium. 
[00:55:30]  Make some noise!  Shade 45's morning actor host, Angela Yee, will be there with exclusive coverage of this historic concert event.  I'm going to be kicking it backstage with the artist, celebrity guest, and maybe I'll even get to interview my boss, Eminem.  Hey, Ange, how you doing?  Later today, 6 p.m. east.  Did you hear him say, hey, Ange, how you doing?  Is that actually him?  That's him.  It's like, you can't really be on his back too much.  That is him saying, hey, Ange, how you doing?  Shut the fuck up. 
[00:56:00]  They got, they probably have maybe three minutes of audio of Eminem on his own channel that they just spliced in a million different ways to make it sound like he's there all the time.  You hear, hey, this is Eminem.  And then that was all he had to say.  To bring the fucking recording device in when he was signing the contract.  Right.  Hey, could you just please say this?  Before we never see you again, could we get some audio as you leave the building?  Here's your copy.  The drinks truck is outside.  Right. 
[00:56:30]  Motherfucker.  Yeah.  G-Unit was there too.  Yeah.  That's right.  Was Who Kid there?  No, because Eminem had his DJ.  So Who Kid?  I mean, he was probably there, but he wasn't on stage because G-Unit didn't need their DJ.  All right, Sambo.  We got to talk about chicks.  So why don't you leave now?  I got this CD.  Who's Eminem's DJ?  Huh?  He was just a touring DJ.  I don't know.  Was he good?  He was good.  I mean, he was just playing the beats off of, you know.  He's got his own channel.  He's great.  I've never seen rap live. 
[00:57:00]  I've never seen rap live.  Like, I don't.  Jay-Z is incredible live.  You have to see Jay-Z live.  I've heard he's good.  I mean.  I would.  You know what?  I have to say, I would go see Jay-Z.  Eminem and Jay-Z?  I would see that.  I would see that in a second.  It was an amazing concert.  I really would.  How much time did they just do?  They each do like over an hour and a half.  The concert didn't end until 1 o'clock in the morning.  Well, no one has to work, so.  Oh, well.  That's not fair.  I mean.  It must be nice.  I was there.  To have nothing to wake up to.  Could Jay-Z follow him?  Jay-Z destroyed him.  Really?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:57:30]  Destroyed him.  Yes.  I mean, if you compare the two sets, Jay-Z annihilated Eminem.  Damn.  Did he do Empire State of Mind?  You bet he did.  What did he close with?  Or New York State of Mind?  Who was singing the Alicia Keys part?  He has a touring female singer.  But it's not Alicia Keys.  I actually know her name.  But then Alicia Keys does the song when she's alone.  And just has some dyke rapper come out.  Well, she's got a remix version that's her version.  It's like two songs.  I'm confused.  I think Jay-Z should force her to tour with the band. 
[00:58:00]  Who owns the song?  Do they call it a band?  I don't even know.  Who owns that fucking song?  That's Jay's song.  It was on Blueprint 3.  That's Jay's album.  But I've seen Alicia Keys do it, and it sounds more like the song I'm used to when I hear Alicia  Keys do the motherfucker.  You've heard that's the remix.  And what?  She makes it into a real song, right?  Yeah!  Out of all that rap crap wrecking the song.  Out of all that rap crap.  Oh, yes?  Kenny!  Sam has some good news about that song.  Oh?  I don't know what it is.  Oh, boy.  He listens to you on that channel. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, yeah.  What are you on?  Hits 1 or something?  I don't know.  Look at the pictures out front.  Sam's is up there, I bet.  I'm sure.  It's a big exclusive at 7.30 on the morning mashup.  Yeah?  They're going to play Empire State of Mind sung by Glee.  The cast of Glee.  Really?  Yeah, big exclusive.  The morning mashup made Perez Hilton because they are premiering Glee's version of Empire  State of Mind, which nobody's heard yet.  But, again, I didn't bring that to this show because it's a different audience. 
[00:59:00]  I don't know why Kenny.  Slightly.  Yeah.  He fraternizes with them.  He went with them to the concert last night.  Oh, did you?  Yes.  And how much does this company pay you to be a traitor to our show?  We need a traitor.  I'm on the show now.  You've got audio.  Yeah, but you're on another channel.  I only got one hour of sleep so I can do this show.  I'm allowed to be on more than one channel, right?  I don't know.  I hope so.  Yeah, right?  Can't put your eggs in one basket around this joint. 
[00:59:30]  Well, sure you can.  I'm in different baskets.  They just step on every one.  See how nice this song could be without all that crap?  It's like what it is.  It's like...  This song is not going to sell out Yankee Stadium.  What?  This song won't sell out Yankee Stadium.  No?  Jay-Z will.  Jay-Z has some power.  I was telling Ant that he should force Alicia Key to get in a goddamn van and go from city  to city just to play that one fucking song with him. 
[01:00:00]  Just has to fire her own piano.  Right.  Yeah, she's got a roadie, her own shit.  Her husband, Swiss Beats, was there.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I'm fucking Swiss Beats.  I'm fucking Swiss Beats, was there?  He's a rapper producer.  Pretty much a producer, but he does hooks, too.  Swiss Beats.  Yeah, he's pretty good.  He did on to the next one.  Oh.  Is Kenny okay?  No.  You okay, Kenny?  Yeah.  Oh.  Why?  I was just wondering, because I didn't get my V8.  So I was assuming...  Oh, yeah, he's too busy plugging the morning mashups to get your drinks. 
[01:00:30]  What about my second coffee?  I didn't get that either.  Nice, Kenny.  Real nice.  I am delinquent.  I'm sorry.  Delinquent.  What are you doing with those glasses, by the way?  Are you writing the Declaration of Independence?  Those fucking glasses are horrible.  I really are.  Hey, Miss Meany, I want to talk to you.  He's awful.  He's dipping his fucking ink pen.  They're on the tip of his nose.  He's got a quill.  Oh, it's terrible.  The Negro! 
[01:01:00]  Writing it out?  Who's Dougie Fresh?  I like Dougie Fresh.  Dougie Fresh is a legend.  Yeah.  There's a guy named Dougie Fresh on the line.  Motherfucking Dougie Fresh.  Is he actually Dougie Fresh?  It's not Dougie Fresh.  Let's get him.  I only talked to people today that have rap names.  If you're calling our show, you need a rap name.  Dougie Fresh, what's up?  I'm four and a half minutes on.  What?  Hi, Doug.  I'm four and a half minutes on.  Yo.  What's up, Dougie? 
[01:01:30]  Is that supposed to be a play on six minutes, Dougie Fresh, you're on?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Didn't go good.  Are you the real Dougie Fresh?  Obviously, he is.  Yes.  Yes, I am.  I have a peg leg.  He has a peg leg.  It's got to be Dougie Fresh.  It's got to be Dougie Fresh, then.  Good evening.  All right.  There goes Dougie Fresh.  Doug!  That was our exclusive interview.  You got it longer than the Eminem interview was on Shady.  Jesus.  You got to see Jay-Z live. 
[01:02:00]  I don't know any of his stuff.  I mean, I bet you would if you heard it.  He's a hit machine.  He really does touch every New York aspect.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I just like going, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Hard Knock Life?  Yeah, see, this is the Jay-Z version.  And since I made it here, I can make it anywhere.  Yeah, they love me everywhere.  Don't call him.  He does look a little like Joe Camel.  He doesn't like it when people say that.  He does look like Joe Camel. 
[01:02:30]  Why does he wear the same glasses as Joe Camel?  The rappers that have dissed him have said he's Camel Face.  They do.  Really?  Who's dissed him by Mike K.  Well, him and Nas had quite a beef, a wild-backed beef.  And like a year ago, Who Kid did a music video.  Why does he have to talk about every block in Manhattan?  He knows he's Manhattan.  At the Burroughs.  He's New York.  He works in every block.  It's like Google Earth.  Right.  Yeah. 
[01:03:00]  Who Kid did a music video where he was, while he was traveling,  he actually got on a camel's back, a real camel,  and made it seem like the camel was lip-syncing Jay-Z lyrics.  It was a good guy.  That's hilarious.  He did.  Yeah, he did.  Oh, okay.  They're not like Joe.  Who Kid likes to start shit with people for no reason?  For absolutely no reason.  He just likes to start shit.  Is he popular?  Yeah, he's a popular DJ.  He's G-Unit's DJ.  I liked him.  He's a friend of the show.  He's hilarious.  He starts shit with people. 
[01:03:30]  G-Unit, motherfucker.  I think he has a gun.  Yeah, he probably owns a gun, yeah.  Sorry, I'm being reminded.  It's Google Earth.  I fucked that up, yeah.  All right, let's talk about the hot.  Yeah, the lexical rug.  Thank you, Sam.  You're welcome.  Oh, you didn't find out if Eminem talked on his own channel last night?  Could you find out?  I mean, look, listen.  The Shade 45 morning show starts at like 9 o'clock in the morning.  They're not in here yet. 
[01:04:00]  Why wouldn't it start earlier?  No, no, you didn't know that?  They don't start at 6.  Yeah, no, no, no.  This is still the late last night show.  Well, you know how it goes.  Angela E.  And the morning after it as it started.  Yeah.  EST and the CPT.  Does she do four hours at least?  She probably does like three hours, I would think.  I'm not positive.  But, uh...  What the fuck?  Well, they're probably still sleeping.  Must be nice.  The staff of Shade 45 has not yet arrived.  But there was a big concert last night.  I mean, I made it, but...  Yeah, of course you did. 
[01:04:30]  What the hell goes on around here?  I don't know.  I slept in E-Rock's office last night.  You did?  Oh, how was that?  It was great.  Now I know why he's got that recliner in his office.  Somebody likes to nap.  It was just a regular chair.  I think he naps.  Oh, yeah.  Until he's leaned back.  It works perfectly.  You think E-Rock naps a lot?  Definitely.  I got a night's sleep in that office.  He's not equipped for that.  It shouldn't be.  Why does he have a recliner?  Because he likes to nap.  It's actually a regular chair, but he's fat. 
[01:05:00]  There's only two recliners in the whole building.  One for the CEO of the company, one for E-Rock.  And he naps.  Because he's got a nap.  He works hard.  He needs to nap.  Obviously, he gave up completely on the trainer and the diet, huh?  Well, I mean, Danny, that's neither here nor there.  He finally said, fuck it.  God bless you.  Looks like he's stealing something under his shirt.  Let's just say he's like a giant ham.  He came over to my house over vacation to celebrate my birthday. 
[01:05:30]  And the trainer would not have been happy with the amount of slices of pizza he ate.  Did he have more than one?  Oh, yeah.  Fucking pizza like that?  How many?  Be honest.  He had to have at least three slices of cheese and then one slice of meat, I think.  So that's a half a fucking pie.  Plus a meat slice, so that's even more.  We call it pie here in New York City.  Right.  Unbelievable.  So he's not doing the trainer?  I don't know if he's...  Look at him. 
[01:06:00]  Maybe he's doing the trainer and the pizza.  Look at him.  What do you think?  His trainers...  I was just going to say.  What did you have?  Tom Carvell is his trainer.  I was going to say his trainer holds a chair and a whip.  Yours was way better.  Chair and a whip.  Because he's fat.  Exactly.  Why are you late?  Well, I had to walk through the Midtown Tunnel.  Like an elephant. 
[01:06:30]  Turn that trash can upside down and he'll stand on it and on one leg.  Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.  Oh, that poor E-Rock.  Love that fucking song.  I was listening to some Biggie Smalls a couple days ago.  He did tribute to Biggie Smalls at the show.  Fuck you.  Shot a fat person?  No, he had the whole audience sing Juicy, which is, you know, probably...  I don't know Juicy.  Oh, you know him.  Give me a little Juicy.  All right.  Biggie Smalls didn't need...  It's all good, baby, baby.  He didn't need no fucking auto-tune. 
[01:07:00]  Well, auto-tune...  He had a horrible voice, but it just worked.  Biz Markie pulls it off, too.  He's a guy who has a terrible voice, but it just works.  That was good, yeah.  Biggie Smalls.  Yeah.  This album is dedicated to all the teachers that told me I never amount to nothing.  This is the truth.  You didn't.  They lived above the buildings that I was hustling for.  It's part of their concern.  When I was just trying to make some money to feed my daughter.  And all the niggas in the struggle.  Here, Puffy in the back there?  That's Puff?  Oh, yeah.  It was all a dream.  I used to read Word Up magazine. 
[01:07:30]  This is good shit.  This might be the most beloved song in New York hip-hop.  Really?  Really?  I think so.  I don't think so.  If you live in New York and you don't know the words to this song in this day and age,  you're out of here.  Get out of here.  I don't know if I've ever heard this.  What?  Why would I have heard this?  It's not an odd fact.  Yeah, he just referenced the Rappin' Duke.  Oh, really?  The Rappin' Duke?  He said, remember Rappin' Duke?  Yaha, yaha.  Holy shit.  See?  That's a little connection. 
[01:08:00]  Ha, ha, ha.  He knows.  He knows the deal.  Treats loves him, Biggie.  You gotta love Biggie.  I mean, he rules.  Every song I've ever heard by him.  You can't say you don't like Biggie.  I don't like Rappin' for the most part.  Here and there, but.  And if you don't know, now you know.  Oh.  Oh.  No.  No, it's a mental capacity smalls.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:08:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  You work here to get abused.  It's never wears smalls.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  The Biggie XLs.  Biggie shirts.  Biggie pants.  Hey, get piggy balls in here.  Talk to him.  He does have to take all the abuse now.  Has E-Rock ever killed a trainer?  I don't know.  He's driven a few out of business, though.  Get that fat kid off the website. 
[01:09:00]  Can you wake him up so he can hear this abuse?  He's in the napping chair.  Of course he's napping.  Like a pizza slice in his hand.  Cheese first on his face.  So if he wakes up, he can just eat without opening his eyes.  Oh, my God.  Can we talk about the Mexican broad now?  All right.  We can play more Biggie.  That was enjoyable.  What's his big album?  Well, he's only got two.  Oh.  I could just buy them both.  Yeah.  One's a double album, so I don't know if you want to roll that. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  Were any of his songs shitty or no?  He was really good.  No, he was incredible.  Who?  Biggie.  Biggie Smalls, make you shit your drawers.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Michigan.  Jeff.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I seem to remember, I don't know if it was last year, but a show you guys did a while  ago where the Rolling Stones came out with the top New York songs, and New York was on  it, and Oak was saying, how does this song make it?  And he was saying a bunch of stuff about it, and I just wondered if he could hear that audio 
[01:10:00]  or if it was available.  Well, a couple.  Now, Oak all of a sudden loves it.  Yeah, I definitely like the Jay-Z song now, but the problem I have with the list is all  of a sudden it's the greatest New York songs of all time, and they put a song on there  that was out two weeks.  Yeah.  That was the point I think I was making that day.  It's not standing the test of time.  But it has since then stood the test of time.  How about New York Groove?  All right, man.  Ace Frehley.  Why do they sing that, those fucks?  Reliable source, E-Rock puts a chair in front of the door so no one can bust in on him  and catch him sleeping. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, Troy must be.  That's apparently on Fridays.  Troy must be the source.  What did you do to sell him right out?  What?  Because you can't see he's sleeping because, like...  You'd have to ask Troy on this one.  He's, you know, he's the one dropping tips.  The big napping chair is tall enough where you can't see what's going on in the chair.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you know, I like there's pictures covering the glass.  Right, right, yeah.  And then you put a chair in front of the door.  That's what I did last night.  You put a chair in front of the door.  The chair is black.  You turn the lights off.  Can't see in the office.  Can't see.  Take a little napski.  Red in Massachusetts is now calling E-Rock Biggie Fries. 
[01:11:00]  Biggie Fries.  That's not cool.  I wish he was awake to hear this shit.  I know.  Fuck, our best material.  E-Rock's just back there going, why did they fire Steve?  He's the go-to guy now.  Now he's the go-to guy.  He was, like, sort of the go-to guy.  Yeah, yeah.  But now with Steve out of the way, it's all about E-Rock.  Yeah.  He used to get so happy when you guys made fun of Steve.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Right now he's fighting apnea on his back. 
[01:11:30]  He wants to come in, but he can't because he's like a lamb.  When he falls on his back, he needs a little shove.  Oh, is he the whipping boy?  All right.  Poor guy.  So we got this hot Mexican.  Is she a reporter?  That's what they're calling her.  She's not there to show her fucking piece of ass.  They're calling her a journalist.  She is juicy talking about Biggie Smalls.  It's so annoying.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Look, you want to be looked at.  Is that her?  The Jets?  Oh, it's her. 
[01:12:00]  She wears the tightest jeans.  On purpose.  On purpose when she's doing her reporting.  And I guess guys aren't supposed to be guys and make comments about this.  I don't get it.  Or look or do anything.  Right.  That's crazy because you're dealing with football players.  Right.  Look at that.  Everyone's seen the picture.  So when I say look at that, you can envision your favorite picture.  Look at that, though.  She's sidelines.  Is that a sideline shot? 
[01:12:30]  She's putting her lipstick on.  She looks like she's going to a club.  I know.  Going to the club.  Oh, hearing some music.  Oh, is Eminem here?  Oh, maybe.  Wait, are they playing our show out there on replay?  No.  No, our show's not allowed.  Sounds like Hits 1 is on.  No, it's not.  Because it might offend somebody.  People like going to radio.  Yeah.  If you go on to radio, you shouldn't be offended.  Could offend some people.  This isn't a fucking tax office.  Habootay. 
[01:13:00]  So what happened?  The Jets player's making some comments about her ass and how hot she is.  A few cat calls, as they call them.  Right, right.  And making some comments.  And she got upset.  Went to the head of the organization there.  She was a little pissed off.  A little PO'd.  Went to Johnson.  This is, you know, not the way that a reporter should be treated on the sidelines, okay?  How about you fucking dress like one?  Put a suit on, idiot.  Yeah.  Put one of those Hillary Clinton dumb fucking suits on.  I hate those things. 
[01:13:30]  It's getting confusing, though, because all these networks are putting the hot piece of  ass in the locker rooms or on the sidelines because they know they look good on TV, but  they have no business doing this shit.  They don't know the sport that well.  Yeah.  Let's sexy it up, but don't acknowledge we're sexy.  There's pigs out there that know football and baseball and all these sports, but they're  not on the sidelines or in the locker rooms because they're pigs.  Well, Pam Oliver isn't exactly jerk-off material.  That's true.  Well, Joe Namath thought.  He didn't know what to say. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, that was...  Wasn't that the Joe Namath one?  I love that one.  Wasn't it Pam Oliver, or who was it?  The drunken Joe Namath.  He had beer goggles definitely looking at her.  Yeah.  Who was that?  That's her.  That's her.  At a basketball game.  Really?  You're not supposed to comment?  You could see her bra through her fucking shirt.  She's wearing, yeah, the see-through shirt.  Get the fuck out of here.  The tight jeans.  She's Miss Spain, by the way.  Look, you could see her pussy in those jeans. 
[01:14:30]  You really can't see.  You should be Miss Norton.  You can't see pussy lips, as they call them.  She's got the camel toe.  Oh, it wasn't Pam Oliver.  It was Susie...  Colber.  Colber?  Oh, Susie Colber.  Right, right.  Oh, well.  What are you going to do?  See, I think this says it all right here.  This is what should be happening with the sideline reporters.  One of the all-time great Jet quarterbacks, Joe Namath and Chad Pennington, 
[01:15:00]  what impresses you about Chad?  I believe everything that anyone else has watched Chad play impresses me.  The same thing impresses them.  He's a quality, classy quarterback that has a touch on the football.  He's not a thrower.  He's a passer.  His mind is ahead of what the defense is.  And if the Jets can support him, they will win this championship. 
[01:15:30]  So it's been a tough season for Jet fans.  What does it mean to you now when the team is struggling?  I want to kiss you.  I couldn't care less about the team struggling.  What we know is we can improve.  Chad missed, Chad Pennington, our quarterback, missed the first part of the season,  and we struggled.  We're looking for next season.  We're looking to make a noise now, and I want to kiss you. 
[01:16:00]  Wow, she blew him right off.  Oh, that's great.  I want to kiss you.  She wants to be taken seriously.  Yeah, yeah.  She's talking to Joe Namath, Broadway Joe.  Broadway Joe don't care.  It's a weird mixture to have the hot female reporter in the locker room or on the sidelines  with fucking guys playing the sport. 
[01:16:30]  It's a weird combo.  They've got to understand, you know, there's a dynamic between men and women.  Sorry.  It's the way it is.  And there's going to be sexual tension and just sexuality floating around when guys are  dealing with women in that capacity.  And sometimes just in this room where it's all men.  Sexual tension.  So thick you could cut it with a knife.  Can he slacks?  Who wouldn't want to see him take those off?  Exactly.  So thick you could cut it with Ben Franklin's glasses.  Quickly hand them over.  Do you think he's actually reading over there? 
[01:17:00]  No!  The magazine's upside down.  He's looking at the pictures.  He's distracted by the colors that he sees.  What are you reading?  Are you reading up on this?  I'm reading about the article about Vince Neil's new book.  Oh, yeah.  We'll get to that.  He's trashing Sharon Osbourne.  That's not a right thing.  Yeah.  1984 tour.  It's not nice.  Sharon took the fun out of the tour that Ozzy was having with Motley Crue. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  And Motley Crue was not happy.  Why did Sharon not want Ozzy dead before 1985?  Is that what she was doing?  Yeah, that was pretty much what she was doing.  Vince is trashing her in his new book.  Even though they sort of get along now.  So, yeah, you got the Mexican broad and her favorite shot is to show off her ass, by the way.  She is constantly spun around.  She's got a look where she turns her ass toward whoever's taking her picture and then looks over her shoulder.  It's that Hollywood starlet red carpet move that all the red carpet, the chicks on the red carpet do. 
[01:18:00]  They turn their head around and they get the ass shot in their face.  And that's what she does.  She's got bikini pictures all over the place.  She's just got...  It's...  That's her right there.  Jesus Christ.  And they're not supposed to fucking say anything?  She's naked.  God, she has great legs, man.  So what are these guys supposed to do?  Not acknowledge that she is an attractive woman.  But they're football players, first of all. 
[01:18:30]  They're fucking animals.  Right.  You're not dealing with gentlemen.  Anything should go in the locker rooms, man.  And if you can handle it, then great.  If you want to be a woman, right.  Have to shit you ask means nothing anyway.  If you want to be a woman in that atmosphere, knowing that these guys are not gentlemen, then you've got to deal with it.  Sorry.  Certain workplace things, you're going to be fine.  You'll go in there.  If the boss fucking slaps you on the hiney, you go and sue, and everything will be great. 
[01:19:00]  You'll make money.  Whatever the fuck.  Football players?  Stop it.  They...  When they're not playing football, they're fucking women.  Right.  That's what they do.  And if these networks want a real interview, send, like, a Susan Boyle-type fucking pig in there.  You'll get a great interview.  Woo.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Susan Waldman?  Because nobody...  Why is it Susan Boyle to really...  Oh, I'm sorry.  I think Susan...  That would be great.  Although Waldman...  Even Susan Waldman.  I mean, come on.  Let's be real here.  No catcalls are going out for Susan Waldman.  She probably wears hush puppies. 
[01:19:30]  Nobody wants to fuck Susan Waldman in Wrangler jeans.  Goodness gracious.  Yeah.  Fucking wet mouth.  All the dramatic things.  I got a camel toe and no one's looking.  Passada noob.  She could have a glow stick on her pussy and nobody would look.  Well, so, what, uh, the Jets owner, Woody, right?  Woody Johnson apologized.  Woody Johnson.  But fucking Susan Waldman doesn't think that's good enough.  What?  She thinks the commissioner of football should apologize.  Shut up.  You know? 
[01:20:00]  Or the players themselves.  Shut up.  We got an apology.  The stupid Mexican broad is fine with the apology because now she's way famous, by the way.  You put a stripper on the sideline.  What do you want?  Now she's way famous and now she can do Dancing with the Stars.  Because that's what happened with the Erin Andrews, by the way.  But no one wants to talk about that, right?  No.  She went through that horrific thing.  Guess what?  It got her to a level of fame she was never going to get if some creep wasn't peeping her.  Peeping.  All of a sudden she was on Dancing with the Stars. 
[01:20:30]  But you tell her that, you know, the only reason you're on Dancing with the Stars was because you were naked in a hotel room.  And some fucking creep was peeping you and put some pictures on the internet.  Which you can find immediately.  There you go.  And that's why she made it to Dancing with the Stars.  Right there.  That lovely picture of her nude.  She's sexy, man.  So now you got the Mexican Heine broad.  She'll be on Dancing with the Stars.  Mexican Heine broad.  Waldman, who started at WFAN in 1987.  And she says, this made me laugh so hard when I was on the turlet this morning. 
[01:21:00]  Endured her share of boorish behavior.  Get the fuck out of here.  Stop it.  From players and from writers.  Was saddened by the incidents all these years after Lisa Olsen.  Do you remember Lisa Olsen, Ann?  Stop.  Let me tell you about Lisa Olsen.  Lisa Olsen?  In 1990, sports writer Lisa Olsen was in the New England Patriots locker room.  Oh, okay.  I remember that.  This is pure comedy.  Oh, yeah.  Who's not loving this?  When players walked in front of her naked and one fondled his genitals. 
[01:21:30]  That's just, those are just shenanigans.  I call those shenanigans.  She was the pioneer in this because she had to deal with some guy fucking fooling around  with his genitals while she's trying to like get a serious interview.  Hey, are men allowed in the fucking female locker room like when Venus and Serena Williams  were playing?  Well, if they are, they are.  Well, the funny thing is because this Joanna Malloy wrote an article on it and the WNBA 
[01:22:00]  playoffs are going on.  So she compared this whole incident to the WNBA and how there are male fucking guys in  the WNBA locker room.  But those players don't walk around with their dicks out.  No.  They might as well.  But are there guys in the locker room?  Yeah, but it's WNBA.  Would you want to see a WNBA player?  No.  Thank you.  I would.  No, you wouldn't.  Trannies.  Hi, Daddy.  Hello.  But Lisa Olsen had a deal with a guy fucking fondling. 
[01:22:30]  Just grabbing his fucking balls and cock and shaking it around at her.  What year was that?  That was 1990, 20 years ago.  Great.  So she started this whole thing.  Yeah.  Before that, you've got to think the players were getting away with murder.  Or was she one of the first ones?  Probably one of the first ones.  Who was the lawsuit brought?  I remember when they made a big...  I think it goes back to 19...  I want to say...  Oh, man.  We need someone that knows sports on the line.  Didn't it start in the late 70s?  Someone sued to be in the locker room?  Yeah, they do get...  There was a whole thing with women wanting to get in there. 
[01:23:00]  And then once they got in there, they're like, ah!  Right.  It's a fucking locker room, dummies.  Right.  What do you think?  So then, Susan Waldman, she's taking this topic on.  She's just trying to prove that she is indeed a woman?  Because nobody believes her?  It's a running joke.  We haven't come very far, have we, she said.  There have to be women around because now it's the law.  But I don't think women are accepted.  They shouldn't be accepted.  It's not an acceptance thing.  Because everyone knows why they're there. 
[01:23:30]  They're there because they're really hot and look great on TV for the most part.  And you can't deny the fucking alpha males that play football.  Like, you can't be that high and not expect at least a guy to make a remark on the field.  And they can be accepted for what they're doing.  They're standing on the sideline.  They throw in one or two little words and then take it back to the booth.  But being accepted and being looked at as a hot chick by fucking football players, two different things.  Again, they're not accepted because everyone knows why they're there. 
[01:24:00]  If they had talent behind their hotness, then maybe, maybe Susan Wallman would have a point.  I can be.  You're watching an NFL game and they got this fucking Playboy model on the sidelines.  You don't even know what she's saying.  She's just looking good.  Looking all hat.  But I don't think women are accepted.  I don't think they're treated the same.  It's just a lot more covert now.  You have to abide by the law.  It's changed a little, but not fast enough and not enough.  She says they for a reason because she's not one of them. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, they.  Wallman fears the worst.  They're going to make it like it's her fault because she's pretty.  No, it's because she's dressing in a way that is.  And again, I don't believe you should be sexually harassed at work.  When you're on a football field, which is such a male environment and you want to show your ass off.  It's not like she was just kind of dressed down.  She's trying to show up.  She's using her sexuality to gain, to become more successful.  Don't be mad when guys make remarks about it. 
[01:25:00]  She was dressed down last night, by the way, because of this big controversy.  Why didn't she have her ass hanging out like she did in the fucking field?  Exactly.  But she was dressed down last night.  I can see what's coming, she said.  It's okay if you're old like me.  Yeah.  But if you're beautiful, all bets are off.  Yeah.  I hope it's just a blip on the radar.  No.  Sorry.  No.  Wallman shouldn't be sticking up for these broads because Wallman actually knows sports.  She does.  At least she's got an accurate self-image.  Yeah, she knows sports.  Why don't you talk about how these pretty women don't really know sports like you do, Susan? 
[01:25:30]  They just feed shit into their earpiece.  And there's a reason why they're hired.  You want to hear the hot football chick?  That's what I want to hear.  All right.  Oh, God.  This fucking, listen to this marble mouth.  Really?  Oh.  But I guess she does her reports in Mexicano.  In España.  Yeah.  So then let me ask you the question.  Did you ever feel embarrassed?  Well, actually, yes. 
[01:26:00]  I feel a little uncomfortable because evidently it's not easy to be in the locker room and hear and notice that everybody is speaking about you.  I'm probably making some jokes, but I never feel on danger also.  So I'm a professional.  I have eight years making interviews with the best players.  So I know that in some moments you must be calm, relax, and only wait for your work. 
[01:26:30]  So what I try to do is not to pay attention and not let this thing disturb me.  But I really know that she hears some things that I didn't hear, and the rest of the media that is inside hears things that I really didn't hear.  So I really appreciate the...  That's interesting.  You said it's interesting?  You knew what she was saying?  Wait, she didn't hear it?  She was a coochie girl.  What?  She didn't even hear the comment? 
[01:27:00]  She didn't hear it.  Somebody else heard the comment?  I guess.  That's what she just said, right?  Look at this, Ann.  Joe in New York.  Go ahead.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  You know, forget about how she's dressed.  On her Twitter, she refers to herself as, quote, the hottest reporter on Mexican TV.  So she's using her sexuality.  It's her shtick.  What does she expect?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then fucking...  Yeah, yeah.  Then take it.  All right.  Very good.  Yeah, man.  Come on.  You can't have it both ways.  Shit.  I mean, when you ladies walk around with these ridiculous fucking outfits, guess what? 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, you're going to be looked at.  People are going to say things.  We're getting boners.  Guys are going to...  Boners.  Guys are going to look at each other and fucking go, hey, check that out.  We're constantly holding back from assaulting you.  Yes.  We really have to hold back from just throwing you down and fucking you.  And throwing jizz on you.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Vermont.  Jeff.  Hey, you guys missed a great line.  Oh?  The Patriot reporter, it was during the first Iraq war, and Victor Kayyem had a great line. 
[01:28:00]  He said, what does this woman and the Iraqis have in common?  They've both seen Patriot missiles up close.  That's funny.  All right.  So what's wrong with that?  Clever.  Hey, I want to say a shout-out to the warden.  Loves your show.  I love your show, guys.  Punching out.  A shout-out?  All right.  What are we?  Shady?  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Todd in Cincinnati.  Todd, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey, Matt.  This is a chick was just on the early show on CBS being interviewed, and she's got one 
[01:28:30]  of the hottest little peekaboo shirts on with about half of both boobs hanging out, a short  skirt.  She's sitting on the sofa, and then across from her, whatever hack she is interviewing  her, has a burka on, basically, and, you know, she's saying she had to cover her ears, and  she was embarrassed, and, you know, come on.  She's going to become a huge star now in America. 
[01:29:00]  Absolutely.  With her dumb fucking accent.  Right.  Yes.  All right, brother.  Anyway, check that out.  Okay, brother.  I just hope we get to see her naked hiney soon.  She pretty much can.  My only concern, and perhaps other female sports reporters...  Who's this broad that has to fucking yip-yip?  Let the whole speak.  My only concern, and perhaps other female sports reporters' concern would be, if you 
[01:29:30]  say that kind of behavior, if harassment, let's say, is proven, if you say it's okay,  that sets a precedent, that that kind of behavior is acceptable.  Shut up.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  You fucking unfunny, uninteresting motherfuckers.  God, they're the worst.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  It's not acceptable.  Oh, it's...  If you say it's okay, she's goading this girl, saying she should, like, pursue this,  to the hilt, get someone fired, whatever. 
[01:30:00]  It's like...  No, she...  It's acceptable.  Was that Gloria?  Oh, you fucking babies.  Was her name Gloria Allred?  Don't mention our pussies until we're throwing it around to get what we want.  Shut up.  God fucking annoys me.  Can't have a big place.  Throw them around.  They really do throw them around.  Some of them are big enough, too.  It's like fucking horseshoes.  Those are the ones I like.  You throw them, and they go...  Hang them over your fucking door for good luck.  Who's that?  That's Nana's cunt.  We just moved in. 
[01:30:30]  If you're being hired because you're hot, then you should have to show your camel toe every day.  Exactly.  Just deal.  Do you worry about that?  Right.  No, I didn't say that it's acceptable.  No, no, I don't believe that it's acceptable, and I want to be grateful to the concern of the  association of poor journalists because they take this thing very seriously, and I think 
[01:31:00]  that it doesn't...  It is not good that this kind of thing happen, and it mustn't happen anymore.  So I'm agreeing with the idea that it's good that everybody knows that a woman or a man  deserves the same treatment in the locker room.  Okay, can you pause this, please?  And how about this?  How about a guy...  You're right.  So how about a guy stands on the sideline in an outfit that is going to bring out sexual  feeling?  You fucking...  That's what annoys me. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  You're using your sexuality.  You can't have it both ways.  Right.  Don't use it and then get mad when somebody...  When someone acknowledges it.  And I don't mean they should touch her or be complete pigs, but if a guy makes a remark...  A dress in some baggier pants and a sports jacket.  Put one of those female sports jackets on.  Yeah.  And do that.  She's wearing a tiny little shirt.  Her ass is fucking...  You don't even know how she got in her jeans.  Purged out.  I don't know how she got in them, right?  Amazing.  God.  Unbelievable.  Those must be stretchy.  Is there an extra zipper somewhere? 
[01:32:00]  What would happen if you wore something that would show off your cock bulge, which every  pair of pants I have on does?  Oh, it's fantastic.  If you wore a pair of fucking spandex and your dick was bulging out, they would find you  repulsive.  Yeah.  Yeah, there would be a problem.  Yeah, there would be a problem.  God damn.  Amazing.  That's a weird world we live in.  Yeah.  Very strange.  Everyone's talking about this one on TV today, though, huh?  Yes.  Because they can show pictures of the girl with the hot ass.  No kidding.  The news knows.  No kidding. 
[01:32:30]  The headline, Jets make asses of selves.  Oh, see?  So even they're saying.  No, they don't.  But even they're bringing up her ass.  And they brought up the Hannah Storm thing again.  Tony Kornheiser.  What?  I mean, get the fuck out of here.  You remember the Hannah Storm with the short fucking skirt?  And he makes a comment?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know why you're not allowed to say this.  Cross-eyed fucking skirt.  Skirt too short.  Fellow ESPN sportscaster Tony Kornheiser sparked a firestorm earlier this year for saying her 
[01:33:00]  skirts are way too short for somebody in her 40s.  Why can't you say that?  Not allowed.  Why?  I don't know.  This isn't regular work.  I know regular work, you guys are fucked.  But, you know, in the media world, we should be able to fucking pinch heinies if we want.  It's the worst.  They just can't fucking just leave things alone.  Shut the fuck up.  Take it.  You're in a locker room.  You're on a sideline.  You're on a field with fucking, yeah, guys that have just been, like Jimmy said, alpha 
[01:33:30]  males, their entire lives have been devoted to just beating the fuck out of other men.  And fucking the cheerleaders.  Yeah.  That's all they know.  And they see a hot fucking girl on the sideline.  And they get this Mexican brother with a hiney for days coming into the locker room.  Two of these guys can't get together and look at her and say, wow, wouldn't you like  to shove your cock in that?  Right.  I mean, it's going to happen.  Why is that outrageous?  Because what she's doing.  That's the thinking of a male right there.  You can't send these guys to sensitivity training.  She's saying, look at my ass.  It's great. 
[01:34:00]  Wait, put me on camera because my ass is great and it makes you want to fuck me.  But don't in any way acknowledge that you want to fuck me.  Right.  Keep that in your own brain.  And it's like, well, what?  A woman can't be pretty?  That's such a fucking semantics game because no one is saying that.  We all know when somebody is just dressing.  I mean, much as we shit on Hillary Clinton, she is dressing nicely like Oprah.  Oprah's a fatso.  She dresses very nicely, but she's not dressing to be sexually.  Exactly.  Right.  She's not trying to be sexually provocative. 
[01:34:30]  Right.  Because she knows it's not about what she looks like, obviously.  But Oprah dresses very, very well.  Why can't she dress like that?  Right.  This girl is all about how hot she is.  I don't even know anything about her, but you've seen this a million times in the past,  right?  Yeah.  So don't bitch about it.  I think you should make these hot reporters wear space suits.  Yeah, really.  Just giant.  Make a rule.  Fucking space helmets.  Right.  If you want to interview the players, you got to go in the locker room in space suits.  How about fucking Ellen DeGeneres?  She dresses very nice, but she's not trying to be sexually provocative. 
[01:35:00]  Right.  Who knows what they like.  But if you want to be taken seriously, you can dress really nice.  You can look good.  But everyone knows when you take that one step further that you're trying to make people  want to fuck you.  Right.  When you're trying to get that effect, no one gives a fuck what you're saying.  It's an unwritten understanding.  Like, you're there to be a hot piece of ass and maybe get something out of the players.  Maybe.  Maybe.  I'm sure there's a guy reporter doing all the heavy lifting.  And she's there to kind of, like, wiggle her ass a little bit. 
[01:35:30]  How many female comics do you know that you enjoy that, I mean, they can look good, but  that are trying to be sexy?  Like, Amy's a pretty girl, and she has good taint, but she's not dressing in a fucking  miniskirt.  She's not trying to be sexually provocative.  That's why people listen to her.  Because she's confident in what she says on the stage.  She doesn't need to.  Sarah Silverman dresses down, actually.  Right.  Yeah, she's hot.  But she doesn't need to show off her hotness.  She's got talent without showing off her ass.  And it's like, well, we can't look good? 
[01:36:00]  No one's saying you can't look good, but everyone knows when you take that one step and  you want people to want to fuck you.  When you get that, when you want that, then don't cry when it works.  Susan Waldman is doing a disservice to women in broadcasting.  She really is.  She should be bringing this shit up.  Like, yeah, you know, it's about time, because all these networks are hiring really hot women.  Exactly.  I guarantee Susan Waldman knows a whole bunch of pigs that can't get a job because they're  not hot, but are very talented in sports talk.  Yeah.  Or sports reporting, whatever. 
[01:36:30]  Yep, but they're ugly and fat, and they can't fucking...  I guarantee she hangs out with fucking fat, fucking ugly pigs that know a lot about sports.  Frumps.  So Susan Waldman is stupid in this case.  You're right.  She's absolutely stupid.  Absolutely.  No one's ever made a pass to her, so she wouldn't know what it was.  Right.  Guys actually put their dicks away when she's in the building.  You put your dick away.  Ugly mutt.  That's her nickname around the locker room.  A little ugly mutt. 
[01:37:00]  Speaking of Susan Waldman, her counterpart had an oopsie.  Where is that?  Oh, yeah.  It's right here.  Oh, yeah.  This happened over break, though, right, Danny?  Yeah.  I remember you emailing this.  Good old John Sterling.  John Sterling.  The home run call guy had this to say over the break.  There goes the deep right center field.  It is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  No, it's off the wall.  Oops. 
[01:37:30]  It is gone.  Oops.  Oh, no.  Oops.  Oh.  A dud.  Good for him.  Yeah.  So take these fucking hot chicks, throw them off the fucking field, get pigs in there so  they could talk about the game legitimately, or have the hot chicks, and they could shut  the fuck up when people say stuff.  Yeah, where's one fucking fat, ugly, where's the fucking female equivalent of John Madden 
[01:38:00]  or Pat Summerall or any of these fucking monsters?  With shotguns in their mouth?  That's where they should be, anyway.  Where are they?  Boom.  But there's none of them.  How come it's only the fucking...  It's like, you're trained, and I know women would go, but men make those decisions, which  in a way they'd be right, but they should...  You're right.  Susan Waltman should be taking the other angle and going...  I mean, she's stupid for coming out and protecting this woman.  What, you can't be pretty?  She's stupid to do that. 
[01:38:30]  Passat is laughing!  Pennant knew!  My wings got potato salad in it!  No one wants to go into my box!  I don't know if we're going to get to it today.  Barbara Walters did a Progeria Kid special that's just one for the ages.  Just her saying, Progeria.  No kidding.  Then you got Oprah losing her shit on her show, because, you know...  Literally?  She has to give stuff away to the audience every year.  Oh, I heard about this.  Yeah, it was a big XM series thing. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, was it?  Yeah, sure it was.  And Lady Gaga explains the meat suit, or the meat dress.  You know, when I saw the meat dress, I was like, what the fuck is that?  But her explanation just makes it all come together, and it makes total sense now.  It's kind of sad, because I'm not a big fan of pop music, but it's obvious she's very  talented, so she doesn't have to do all that shit.  Like, what is she doing?  That's kind of how she was able to get to the point where people took notice that she 
[01:39:30]  even had any talent, which I still...  That's debatable, as far as I'm concerned.  But I'm kind of embarrassed for her when she walks on the stage in a meat suit at the  VMAs when she's really talented.  Like, what are you doing?  You look like a fool.  What, your little monsters are enjoying your meat dress?  What do the little monsters think?  Her meat suit.  Yeah.  I had one of those once.  Oh, did you?  Yeah.  It's made out of, like, ham hocks and liverwurst.  Any pictures?  No. 
[01:40:00]  It was like, I had shoulder pads and liverwurst.  We should put someone in a liverwurst.  Try to put E-Rock in one as he's just eating it.  Eating it constantly.  It's like trying to put a fucking bee in a honey hat.  We just go broke because he keeps eating the fucking meat suit.  We stop eating it.  We're trying to do a bit for the radio.  It's like trying to put a fly in a shit tuxedo.  Right.  It's like trying to put a bear in a salmon suit. 
[01:40:30]  Come on.  This is fun, guys.  Someone nudge E-Rock so he can enjoy this abuse.  Yeah, wake him up.  Wake him up.  This is grade A material.  Look at the meat dress.  It's just silly.  And it's real meat.  Yes, it is.  God, her fucking must have stunk after that.  Oh, God.  I'd still eat a big fat pussy, though.  Oh, I would literally, I would fucking move her fucking roast beef 1920s New Year's Eve  outfit and fucking lick that giant fucking clit. 
[01:41:00]  Lick her fucking.  You got to pull one of those strip steaks away and she goes, ow, that's connected.  And she goes, yay.  Exactly.  Hey, why is this fucking filet mignon poking out of this hair?  You thought it was just grizzle?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  It's not grizzle.  Yeah.  You know, the stupid paper today had a butcher talking about the meat dress.  Of course.  And stupid Lady Gaga, like, went for cheap meat, basically.  I would hope so.  Yeah, that kind of looks like, you know, flank steaks and things like that.  I think they said flank. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, that doesn't look like that.  I think they decided it was flank.  I like to fuck her in the butt and get E. coli on my dick and stick it in E-Rock's mouth.  Sorry, E-Rock.  I don't mean that.  As he's sleeping.  Yeah.  You know, we're kind of doing the Lady Gaga thing.  So she was on Ellen to describe, um, to, um.  Apparently they're good friends.  Well, I wonder what that means.  My girlfriend is so tired of me talking about Lady Gaga's performances on Ellen.  But, man, she did a version of Speechless on Ellen.  She's just really good.  She's very talented.  She's fucking good, man.  That's why this is weird.  Like, you look like a fool for no reason. 
[01:42:00]  Like, I don't know if you know Kesha, TikTok, the TikTok fraud.  She's good.  She should be wearing the meat dress.  Yeah.  Because she doesn't have any talent whatsoever.  She's auto-tuned.  She's a studio creation.  So have her in the dumb meat dress.  She should be wearing a dress made out of glue and vomit.  I like how Lady Gaga there had the meat hat, too.  Yeah.  The little, like, the Lucille Ball hat that she used to get in trouble for buying because  she didn't tell Ricky.  That stupid meat hat tilted to the side. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, she must have smelled.  Oh, God, that had a stink.  I hope she just passed out in it.  Yeah.  Fucking drank too much and passed out in bed in her meat suit.  She woke up in the fucking...  And maggots had built an emerald city on her cliff.  Shit.  Who was that?  The other one?  What's her name?  That's Kesha.  Kesha?  Kesha's really hot.  Let's see a picture of Kesha.  Although, like, some picture's really hot.  Other picture's not so much.  That's funny.  Like, the one...  The second one in that you had up wasn't bad, right? 
[01:43:00]  Did I go on?  Let me see.  Ba-dee-dee-dee-da.  See, she's not bad.  She should be wearing the meat dress, though, because she doesn't have the talent, really.  Yeah.  I don't know.  So she needs a meat dress.  Is that what happens?  If you don't have talent, you need a meat dress?  Yes, Ant.  You know that.  Oh, great.  You know that shit.  I want to make...  I want to make a cummerbundum of pasta fizzle.  That's what I want to do.  A gabagol.  A gabagol.  I'm going to make a tie out of gabagol.  My...  My muddiest... 
[01:43:30]  My mudda...  My mudda would make a tuxedo and would make your mouth water.  Unbelievable.  The way she...  She would take her meatballs and mold them into spats.  Socks out of cow tongues.  God bless.  Rest in peace.  And Lady Gaga won all the VMAs.  We haven't really talked about the VMAs.  Did she sweep it?  Yeah, she did.  Just about everything.  But she really wanted to win the Grammy.  But the Grammy people aren't going to fucking pay attention to someone that puts a building  on her fucking head and walks out on a stage. 
[01:44:00]  She fucked herself because she had the talent to win Grammys, but they're not going to give  it to someone that looks ridiculous.  There were also those Rolling Stone asshole mentality, so they...  I understand that.  But if you're Lady Gaga, you want the Grammy.  Sure.  So...  And she's smart enough to...  She should have dressed down a little bit and she would have won a million Grammys.  What are we looking at, Danny?  Picture her?  Kesha's hiney, which...  It's a little rough.  Kedalur sign, huh?  Kedalur sign, huh?  That's her name.  Kedalur sign, huh? 
[01:44:30]  What was the one that...  Blessings.  That's right.  Oh, multiple blessings.  Multiple blessings.  Yes.  Here's Lady Gaga explaining the meat dress.  Anyway, but what is the purpose of the meat?  Elena said that so many times.  What do you think the answer's going to be?  I already think I know what it is.  It's about gays in the military or something like that.  It's got something to do with gay rights. 
[01:45:00]  Why?  Where's the connection?  Because they want meat all over them?  Yeah, that's true.  That's a gay guy's dream to wake up with dicks all over them?  What happened?  I don't know, fucking dicks fell out of the ceiling while I was sleeping, and now they're  stuck to me like confetti.  Covered in meat.  That's every gay man's dream that you wake up with, there's cocks all over you.  You're covered in cocks, like you're being attacked.  Can you go back to the Kesha picture?  Your ass should never look like it has a log in it.  Yeah, she does.  Kesha bikini pictures. 
[01:45:30]  Don't...  Oh, God.  That's not very flattering.  No.  Her asshole looks like Droopy Dog.  That's horrible.  It's horrible.  She's a drop ass.  Yeah, it's a little droopy there.  Yuck.  Anyway, but what is the purpose of the meat?  Well, it's certainly no disrespect to anyone that's vegan or vegetarian.  Shut up.  I, as you know, I'm the most judgment-free human being on the earth.  However...  Whiny.  You're not.  Originally...  You're not the most judgment-free.  Stop giving yourself titles. 
[01:46:00]  Didn't she judge the government?  Of course.  What was she judging recently?  If she was judgment-free, she wouldn't have been making a statement with the meat.  She'd be like, what's the meat about?  I felt like wearing meat.  Exactly.  You figure it out.  I'm not telling you.  Yeah.  My pudding suit fell off.  I had to get a meat one quickly.  My suit made of cottage cheese.  It got blown off by someone's fan.  Someone had a ceiling fan, and my cottage cheese fucking hat was blown all over like Kennedy's  brains on the fucking limo.  And if she wants to be outrageous, make a dress out of, like, baby seal eyes or something. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, that'd be great.  I look like I was wearing a meat hat.  Yeah, I started this.  Hoo-hoo, she's ripping me off.  Yes, my brother wore a meat hat in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel.  Oh, my other brother wore a pudding hat at the end of his career.  Dacard.  The end of the Dacard.  However, it has many interpretations, but for me this evening, it's as if we don't stand 
[01:47:00]  up for what we believe in, if we don't fight for our rights, pretty soon we're going to  have as much rights as the meat on our bones.  That is the worst point I've ever heard.  She makes really bad points.  Wow.  She makes the terrible points.  Shut up and say.  As the meat on our bones.  The meat on our bones does have rights.  It does.  Because it's part of us, asshole.  Yeah, that made no sense.  Yeah.  If we don't stand up for what we believe in.  They don't read the Miranda rights to your bones and then take your meat in for questioning. 
[01:47:30]  Stupid.  It's all or nothing.  Yes, it's all connected.  The meat on our...  That is the...  She was trying to be fucking interesting.  And then they're like, what does that mean?  And she had to think of something.  Yeah.  And the audience just...  The dumb lemmings.  Yeah, applaud her non-statement.  They probably just showed a picture of something.  All right.  And...  Call her out, Ellen.  I am not a piece of meat. 
[01:48:00]  You are.  I hate the audience.  I don't know what to do.  I hate them.  They're just...  They're showing pictures of vaginas.  The whole crowd is going...  Of course they are.  Why didn't Ellen go, what the fuck are you talking about?  Yeah, what are you talking about?  There should have been a follow-up there.  Don't let her get away with that horse shit.  Here's what she is.  She's a 25-year-old kind of, you know, average dumbbell from New York who's now a superstar  and is being listened to.  She's the type of girl you go on a date with.  You'd fucking jerk her a big clit like a cow on her and get blown in the fucking car. 
[01:48:30]  That's actually the sound she made when she was out with a gentleman of color and sucking  his dick.  It's always a gentleman of color.  Of course.  The white guy made the Alejandro noise that wasn't effective.  Alejandro.  I love her too.  I think she's fucking terrific.  Simple.  She doesn't have to do the meat dressing.  Great performer.  Amazing package, shoved into her underpants. 
[01:49:00]  You made it.  Leave that shit to the fucking one hit wonders.  She should have taken all that meat and shoved it into her panties and said,  Could you see the difference?  Everybody went, No, we don't.  Let me see  Danny  Danny's showing giant clit pictures  That's too big a clit  The one that looks like a fucking  It's a huge schnoz  Oh come on  That's not a  Why don't we take a break  Because Bill Burr is here  Yeah he's going to be here the next couple days 
[01:49:30]  Good news  We like when Bill is in New York  Oh and  Michael Moore  He needs attention because his last thing was bombed  This is what it is  Let me say something outrageous  I brought this to everyone's attention yesterday  But now he went on Wolf Blitzer  Of course he did  Who else would talk to him about this nonsense  What do you think he thinks about the monster  Oh is that a tease  It's Michael Moore  What does he think 
[01:50:00]  I don't know what he thinks  But I know what he said is he's trying so hard  To be the guy who delivers the tough message  And it's like  You don't believe that  And if he gives something  He said that they should put the  We know what he said  He should put the mosque on  On ground zero  And his argument would be  Because it strengthens  And this country's about  You don't mean that  You're playing a semantics game  You're phony  You know why it's despicable  Don't be mad because capitalism thing  Fucking tanked 
[01:50:30]  Why don't we just ask him  He's asleep in the office  On one of the lounge chairs  No see that's E-Rock  No this is Michael Moore  That contributes less  That's ways more  That's always another one  Yeah it's a better one  I wish he was Rudy Ray Moore  Because he moves like him  Because he was paralyzed  Oh no wait that was a different guy  Whatever  I'm bombing in a circle  In a circle  I had the time of my life 
[01:51:00]  Now I never felt this way before  Yes I swear  It's the truth  And I owe it all to you  Because I've had the time of my life  Now I've always loved this view  I've been waiting for so long

[01:56:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show would like to honor the late, great Patrick Swayze with a tribute featuring his 1987 hit song from the Dirty Dancing soundtrack, She's Like the Wind, and now, Patrick Swayze.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh. 
[01:56:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  I don't want to take what you can do.  I don't want to stop the virus.  You're a little bit.  You're a little bit.  You're a little bit.  You're a little bit.  You're a little bit.  You're a little bit.  You're a little bit.  You're a little bit.  You're a little bit.  Obi and Anthony, Bill Burr in studio.  Bill Burr's got another Comedy Central special this Sunday at 11 o'clock. 
[01:57:00]  Bill Burr, Let It Go.  And then it comes out on DVD on October 5th.  So make sure you check it out on Comedy Central Sunday night at 11 o'clock.  What does Let It Go mean, Bill?  What inspired that?  Were you letting go of things?  No, it's kind of like when I get real drunk in a bar.  Yeah.  And I just fucking start going off on shit.  And like when the person's already tapped out of the argument, but I still just want to keep going.  Oh, right, right.  All right, dude.  All right, dude.  Let it go.  Let it go.  Let it go. 
[01:57:30]  Please.  That makes perfect sense.  Are you going to be wearing a meat suit?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  There's a meat on your bones.  You heard that clip.  I was and just like it wasn't up.  The point wasn't annoying enough.  She had to do that running out of air thing.  Yeah.  We're going to have as many rights as the meat on our bones.  It's like, oh, my God.  Somebody fucking suffocate her with the seat cushion.  I think she needs a writer.  She needs a writer for to explain her outfits.  I don't know.  We were talking during the break, though.  That's one of those things. 
[01:58:00]  When she's in her 30s, she's going to look back on that and cringe.  She's any sort of a human being.  Yeah.  She'll look back and say, I was young.  I thought I knew things.  I watched some YouTube videos.  I was on Wikipedia.  I thought I connected the dots, but I didn't.  You brought up Fiona Apple.  Because Fiona Apple used to do all that horse shit.  Oh, yeah.  Where is she now?  You know she's cringing looking at her old stuff, right?  Absolutely.  Pulling her turtleneck sweater up over her head.  I think her.  With no pants on.  She was misunderstood.  What about Sinead O'Connor, too? 
[01:58:30]  No, Sinead is still a militant.  Is she still a militant?  She's still a militant.  Is she?  Yeah, absolutely.  Ripping up a picture of the Pope on fucking SNL.  That was dramatic, though.  That was unbelievable.  You can't do that.  She's got a big head of hair.  She looks like a dyke.  You think?  Jesus.  That's a great observation.  Seinfeld over here.  I never looked at it quite that way.  I heard Yafit Kodo's black, too.  Can I see her picture?  She looks like a dyke.  That's what she looks like today.  Jesus.  Detective Kumia. 
[01:59:00]  I'm the case.  Jesus Christ.  When they asked her on her bio, it says she likes pussy sandwiches for lunch.  What did I know?  Jesus Christ.  It just came out of my face.  I don't know what I was saying.  Janet Reno called her a dyke through a bullhorn.  Yeah, because she kind of had feminine features back when she was, you know, popular, but  now she kind of looks like fucking Sinead Borgnine.  She should be driving a fucking cab and escape from New York.  Oh, look at her gut. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, my God.  She's got a lesbian gut.  Oh, she's great.  Wow.  She's got a lesbian gut.  Oh, she's great.  What happened?  Oh, wow.  Nothing compares to food.  To stew.  Oh, Bill, good to have you back.  What brings you to New York?  I wanted to come here.  I wanted to come here and watch those loudmouthed Jets get their asses kicked last night.  Dude, that was the easiest money I ever made.  I bet the Ravens straight up. 
[02:00:00]  Did you really?  What kind of a game plan is that?  What was the spread on that game?  His game plan was, I know, I'm going to make Ray Lewis even madder before we play him.  I hope he talks shit again this week.  Like, we play the Patriots.  For the first time in 10 years, the Patriots actually had a quiet training camp.  No one, because this guy was running his goddamn mouth.  Yeah.  Dude, and what I love, too, is people actually think that he's confident.  Who, the coach or the player, Bill?  The coach.  Okay.  Rex Ryan.  Yeah.  That was one of the most insecure dudes I've ever seen in my life.  Chronic need to be liked.  Cries himself to sleep with a vat of ice cream every night. 
[02:00:30]  Hard to argue that point, Bill.  Damn.  Being a just man.  You know what?  One of the great things about being a psycho is you can spot another psycho from across  the room.  When I watch that guy, like, just when he makes jokes to the press and when they laugh,  that pathetic need to be liked.  Is that a good one?  I'm just like, oh, he's got the disease.  He's got it.  He's got it in him.  10-9, man.  I actually really like him, and I think he's a great coach, but that voice in his head  won't allow him to think it.  He's got to calm down a little bit. 
[02:01:00]  What were the points last night?  I don't even know.  I didn't even, I just straight up, I was like, I also gave, what's his face, a little  more credit.  I said, Joe Flacco.  Yeah, Flacco.  He was really annoying the shit out of me.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Is that real, Danny, by the way?  What?  Yeah.  There's another, one of these happy birthday things.  What?  Breaking news?  Breaking news, and this is for, I think, happy birthday to Chip.  What?  I think there's a Chip happy birthday.  There's someone out there that's getting this on TV.  This has been happening. 
[02:01:30]  Some of these local news all over the country, they do these happy birthdays every morning.  Can we play one of the old ones?  Yeah, play one of the old ones to kind of give people an example of what this is.  But they do the happy birthdays.  Hey, happy birthday to Mitch in Boston, or whatever the fuck it is.  And a lot of people like sneaking in Jimmy's characters from the show into these birthday  wishes.  So they send them in, and the news people actually mention it.  And it's not just happy birthday.  They mention, like, who's wishing them a happy birthday. 
[02:02:00]  Very inside.  And it's just people from the show.  Inside.  A lot of show references.  Very inside shit.  It really is completely inside.  Here's one that got on the local news.  This is an older one.  It is birthday time.  It sure is.  Happy 12th birthday to Michelle Tlusty.  Birthday wishes from Mom, Dad, Melanie, Joey, Casey, and Rascal.  Happy 7th birthday to Connor Peterson.  Birthday wishes from your fishing buddies, Lacey and Scott.  Oh, my God.  How do they not know that?  I know.  That is the worst one I've ever heard. 
[02:02:30]  It really is awful.  Connor.  Come on.  Lacey and Scott.  Fishing buddies.  Lacey and Scott.  No, but Connor Peterson is a famous name at this point.  Yes.  Of course it is.  And if you don't know, then the fishing thing kind of brings it together.  And then Lacey and Scott.  Happy birthday to Abraham Lincoln from the Wilkes Booth family.  Right.  Happy birthday to Six-A-Million-A-Jews from Uncle Adolf.  Can we play another one?  Oh, God. 
[02:03:00]  That really is silly.  Connor Peterson.  Let's meet our champions right now.  Happy 46th birthday to Terry Brookins.  She likes to dance, play golf, go on vacation, and dreams to go on a cruise someday.  Happy birthday from Rick, Kaylee, and Ron.  Happy 10th birthday to Danny Benoit.  He likes to play Xbox, lacrosse, and just talk on the phone.  Happy birthday, Danny, from your wrestling chums, Vinny, Christopher, Eric, Sam, Greg, Tony, and Uncle Paul.  Do you know that one? 
[02:03:30]  No, I don't know who that is.  Chris Benoit strangled his family to death.  Chris Benoit.  He was a wrestler.  The wrestler.  He took his own life.  His son strangled his own fucking son.  It's one of the most horrific fucking stories in the last five years.  That's how dumb these...  And he says from your wrestling chums.  Wrestling to bring it all together.  That's how dumb these newsreaders are.  They don't know anything they're talking about.  It's like the serial killer who wants to get caught.  Just lingering around after the murder.  Did somebody arrest me?  The arsonist that stands by the fire truck, watching him put out the fire. 
[02:04:00]  Aroused.  He's the only guy standing there with half a heart on.  And rod, smelling of gasoline.  Asking too many questions for the fire chief.  This guy must have been real smart, huh, chief?  It's like fishing for compliments.  Dumb David Berkowitz.  You're murdering a couple.  Stay away from the fire hydrant.  You fucking idiot.  Don't.  Oh, my God.  Is there one more?  Yeah, let's play one more before we get to the new one.  Time now for birthdays on the 7th.  Turning seven years young, Nevaeh. 
[02:04:30]  I'm hoping that's right.  Stern.  She is a little piece of heaven.  Likes Hannah Montana and likes to help others.  Nevaeh, happy birthday to you.  And turning 77 years young, Paul Hargis enjoys playing patty cake with all of his grandchildren.  And, hey, this is the best part.  He enjoys watching First News every day.  Thank you, Paul.  And a very happy birthday to you.  It is 6-20.  I'm not 77.  I'm 57.  Let me sound like an older gentleman.  But you do like playing patty cake. 
[02:05:00]  Yes, I do.  Oh, we got a brand new one.  We got a brand new one.  So this is a brand new one.  Brand new one just came in.  I guess Chip making his birthday debut.  Chip's a good boy.  God bless this guy, whoever he is.  All right.  Young Billy, it's good to see you.  Good to see you, too, Uncle Paul.  Sounds like a plan.  Thank you, Christy.  Celebrating today, Kelly Elizabeth Michaels is turning 6 years old.  Happy birthday, Kelly.  Love pop.  She was five.  Lyle Chip Chiperson is turning 37 years old today. 
[02:05:30]  Best wishes.  Love Uncle Paul.  Greg, Tony, Ted, Edgar, Jim, and Steve from Yellowstone.  If you have a birthday, wish you'd like me to hear it.  Edgar.  They threw Edgar in.  Or look on the PA on the show.  Look at the picture.  The picture, I swear, it looks like a fucking mugshot.  It's so obviously a mugshot.  The guy's got a hella mullet going.  Crazy ass mullet going.  A crooked mustache.  He's got, like, fucking inbred face. 
[02:06:00]  Almost like he's trying to...  No eyelashes.  No eyelashes.  What the fuck?  This guy, he won't be doing any modeling soon or nothing.  That's right, Chip.  Holy no.  You gotta fucking get that up online so the people can see.  How do you not know looking at that fucking picture?  Boy, they must have had no other birthday wishes. 
[02:06:30]  Can we play the names again?  And please, the names are great.  There's 30 of them.  Steve from Yellowstone.  Jesus.  Danny Sennett's going to tweet it.  Happy birthday, Kelly.  Love, Pop.  Lyle, Chip, Chipperson is turning 37 years old today.  Best wishes.  Love, Uncle Paul, Greg, Tony, Ted, Edgar, Jim, and Steve from Yellowstone.  If you have a birthday, wish you'd like to get on there.  Just sign up to the address on your screen.  Or log on to PAHomepage.com.  Isn't that great?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What do you think that guy did?  That guy, that haircut, that's anywhere from, like, shoplifting to molestation. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I'm thinking domestic.  The mullet is always good for domestic assault on a wife or girlfriend.  Or molestation, yeah.  That's unbelievable.  Very good.  Wow.  He was doing those very fucking good, man.  God damn.  I love when those come in.  Just so fucking fun.  It's wonderful to just put those dumb newsreaders in their place.  Do a little research, stupid.  Fucking Google the name.  Google the name Liar Chip Jefferson. 
[02:07:30]  I could say it, and they'll never do it.  Because I was going to say, haven't you guys been talking about this?  Yes.  I would think that the bit would be over the second you say it on radio.  Google.  Look at our door.  Yeah, yeah, see?  Look at that.  Those are all the screen caps.  Those are all real happy birthdays.  Google Lyle Chip Jefferson.  They got that Jimmy, Ted Sheckler.  Oh, yeah.  Ted Sheckler, Paul Hargis.  Oh, yeah.  We got some of the other ones, Travis?  Yeah, for Bill Burr, why not?  And they got 77 years.  It's not even like he has any Benjamin Button makeup on.  Look at that.  He's clearly.  Here's another one that got through, Bill.  First, happy birthday to you. 
[02:08:00]  We've got some great ones to celebrate.  Celebrating on February 1st.  I think Jimmy's celebrating birthday today.  Yeah, Captain Jimmy Nortonberger, we're told it's his birthday, if you know Captain Jimmy.  43 years old.  Happy birthday from Steve, Sammy, Greg.  And Chip, Tony, and Uncle Paul.  That's a great one with Captain Jimmy.  And it's clearly a Photoshop picture of Sully Sullenberg and Jimmy morphed together. 
[02:08:30]  Here it is.  I just like that.  That's just fun.  Captain.  Captain.  The third thing down.  Do you think he has this ship?  We'll be right back.  Like, the third thing down is YouTube, Opie and Anthony, more Chip Chipperson.  Fucking asshole Lyle Chip Chipperson.  Like, all you'd have to do is Google the fucking name and you'd realize it's a joke.  Dummy.  Stupid news.  His Facebook page. 
[02:09:00]  My favorite.  Look at the mouth.  It doesn't even fit.  The Ted Sheckler Photoshop is my favorite thing ever.  That Photoshop of Ted Sheckler is horrendous.  Unbelievable.  That's the best thing I've ever seen.  He has a horrible mustache.  People are fantastic.  Yep.  Love it.  Awful photos of me.  Just talents.  Fucking A.  You ever put out a Lounge Jack record?  That should be the name of it.  People are fantastic.  People are fantastic.  The new easy listening. 
[02:09:30]  I just want to tell you.  So we did the Lady Gaga meat fucking dress.  Yes.  Really just took down my Jets a notch or two.  No, I didn't.  I still think it doesn't mean they're not going to win the division or even the goddamn Super Bowl.  I just don't understand.  Was it a tough division?  I don't even know.  Our division, yeah.  Well, this thing, the Jets defense is awesome.  I know.  Absolutely.  Their offense is anemic.  But, I mean, they were also going up against the Ravens.  They'll beat most of the average to shit teams. 
[02:10:00]  They'll beat them.  But when you go to playoffs, you're going to be playing Ravens or better.  Defense wins Super Bowls, though, right?  I just don't understand why you would get the whole league amped up to kick the shit out of you.  Actually, the best thing that could have happened to them was that they lost.  So now they shut up.  Keep your mouth shut.  Yeah, I was kind of hoping that they were going to win.  Everyone will calm down now.  Yeah, and they would keep talking.  Maybe it is good.  What was he saying, Rex Ryan?  I haven't paid attention.  Basically, that they were going to win the Super Bowl and here we come. 
[02:10:30]  Look out, fuckers.  We're kicking your ass.  I'm the shit.  Right.  It's all of them.  Shut up.  Voice in my head.  I am as good as my dad.  I am as good as my dad.  He's his own worst enemy, right?  That old gag.  Yeah.  How were your pats this year?  I don't even know.  I was flying when they played.  It looked like the offense was great, but they let up a ton of yards.  But somehow they only let up 24 points.  But what's-his-face there?  It had like 350 yards.  Ocho Cinco had like 179 yards. 
[02:11:00]  59 yards or something.  So, yeah, there's still yards to be gained on us.  So, I mean, we got the shit kicked out of us by the Ravens.  We got raped in the playoffs.  So, I still think it's the Jets' division.  I mean, I don't know.  Sanchez, at least he manages the game now.  He doesn't throw interceptions, but he couldn't get them going, though.  What did you think of Michael Vick getting out there, throwing the ball around?  Yeah, it was great.  A lot of running.  That motherfucker just doesn't care.  He'll run right in. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, yeah.  Like, he's not like-I think he feels, I really got to fuck myself up  so people get over this dog bullshit.  They got over it in Philly, though.  They don't give a shit.  Oh, Jesus.  Philly?  Come on.  They probably bonded with him.  I like this guy.  He seems down to earth.  I also torture my pets.  It's a fucking dog.  They don't care.  They're over in Philly, yeah.  They really are.  Are they really?  Oh, yeah, they are.  That's great. 
[02:12:00]  They're fine with it.  They're really fine with it.  Yeah, you could do anything as long as you get those people a Super Bowl championship.  Why would they care?  They don't care about some fucking dog.  Dude, I'll tell you, the next Michael Vick coming is that kid on University of Michigan.  Did you watch?  The guy's insane.  I don't know.  He throws for like 270 yards and ran for 250.  Jesus.  He set the record, the all-time record, last week and then broke it this week.  Wow.  Those were his first two weeks.  He's one of those guys.  Okay, the first receiver's covered.  Are you going to check your second or third? 
[02:12:30]  Nah, fuck that.  I think he'll just run 70 yards for a touchdown.  Look, I looked.  You weren't open.  What am I supposed to do?  One of those guys.  Either that or I'll blow his knee out and become a bitter gym teacher.  Who's the best scrambler ever?  Or that.  Or that.  Or that.  That could happen, Anthony.  Bill, that's a question for Bill.  I don't know.  Best scrambler ever, do you think?  I mean, Starbuck was known as one at one point and Tarkington, obviously, but it's like Michael  Vick and McNabb.  These guys are way better at it.  The guy at a diner would make an eggs. 
[02:13:00]  I don't understand what you mean.  I'm talking football.  Scrambled.  That's a good one.  Eggs.  This guy.  Best scrambler ever.  Someone with eggs.  I said that.  I'd go Elway or Steve Young.  Oh, Elway.  Fuck yeah.  That's Steve Young, man.  Just because those motherfuckers could stop scrambling and then throw it 40 yards back  across the field.  How did that work?  It wasn't just those other guys.  Like, you know, when Vick starts running, you know he's just going to run. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  There's nothing you can do about it.  Yeah.  I forgot Elway used to scramble.  Fuck yeah.  Late in his career, he was not moving as much, obviously.  Those moves where they have to actually bend over and kind of roll off the guy, and he's  looking around for a receiver, and they're all over him.  It amazes me.  And none of those guys can walk after they're 40.  There's no way anybody should ever get mad at what a professional football player makes.  Forget about it.  Is the guy, what's his name? 
[02:14:00]  Denard Robinson?  Robinson, yeah.  Oh my God, he's got that fucking Predator shit happening out the bottom of the helmet.  No kidding.  Yeah, he looks like a running back playing.  Fumbles the snap, takes off.  Broken plays are very easy.  Holy shit, look at this guy.  Threading needles.  Threading needles.  Wow.  It's like watching, you know, the fifth grader who kid his growth spurt, and he's just way  beyond everybody else. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, fucking wow.  But is he, can he throw?  Yeah.  How many people are in that fucking stadium in Michigan?  I know, right?  That place was packed.  That looked like more than an NFL stadium.  They love their college football.  Oh yeah, over 100,000.  The guy's built like an Ethiopian marathon runner.  100,000 people?  He doesn't have a lot of meat on him.  Yeah, and they keep having battles.  Like, college football's insane.  So like, they'll have like 104,473, and then Ohio State will add like another tier just  so they can get, well, we're in the biggest stadium. 
[02:15:00]  It's like the Stanley Cup.  No, it's out of control.  You remember?  They're just adding rings to it.  Yeah, and back in the day, you remember the old stadium?  Like, you line up for a field goal and you're like watching someone take a piss out in the  parking lot?  Now it's just completely enclosed and they just keep building them just higher and higher.  109,000 people.  109,000.  Can I see that again, Danny, that view?  That view that we just saw, I've never seen a stadium that crowded.  Oh yeah, they just pack them out.  I went to a Michigan-Ohio State game out there.  It was insane.  I can imagine. 
[02:15:30]  Are the people kind of split on who they want to win?  You know, there was a lot of rivalry going on that day, Jimmy.  I don't know college.  Look at that.  Wow, look at what that looks like.  He's not even looking at a corner of the stadium there.  Looks like a Larry the Cable Guy show.  Impressing.  And he's standing up and thinks we're hot shit.  Larry's doing arenas.  What does that look like?  It's just a massive piece.  It looks like a concert.  Like the aerial view of a concert.  Yeah, it's like Woodstock, man.  What's the biggest stadium in the NFL?  I guess Dallas, right?  It has to be?  I went to that one. 
[02:16:00]  That one's ridiculous.  100,000?  Is it 100?  I don't know.  It's nice.  It has to be, right?  Well, they could get over 100,000, but then the fire department came in and they were  just like...  Fuck that.  Well, they had like standing room only that was like 25 people deep, so you couldn't see  shit.  We got a guy yelling on instant feedback, happy butt from Ann Arbor.  113,000.  A lot of exclamation points.  I was there.  Yeah, you were 112,000.  Yeah, you were in the whole state.  I mean, it's more exciting if you...  I mean, more impressive if you weren't there. 
[02:16:30]  You think it's easy to get out of the parking lot after a game like that?  Oh, God.  Imagine how long that takes.  Damn it.  No, but that Michigan-Ohio State rivalry puts that Yankee-Red Sox shit to shame.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not like...  You know, you go out to the Midwest and it's like, hey, Mom, you want some pop?  It's over on the backs.  And you're just looking at them like, look at these fucking nerds.  And the second that stuff starts, you get nervous.  Like, am I wearing the right colored shit?  It's hardcore, right?  It's ridiculous.  I don't understand college.  It's not even fun.  And it was just like, at least maybe the people I was with. 
[02:17:00]  Well, we got someone from Ohio checking in.  Chris in Ohio.  Go ahead.  Hey, Denard Robinson, for one thing, cannot hold a candle to Terrell Pryor, the Ohio State quarterback.  If he's a guy who could really throw and really run, Denard Robinson's going to get broken in half by midseason.  He's only 185 pounds.  And the problem is, he can't do anything but run.  He can throw the short routes, but Michigan is terrible.  Well, Michigan will be lucky to win half their games this year. 
[02:17:30]  They're going to kill you guys this year.  Oh, no.  Seven straight Ohio State beatings of Michigan.  Yeah, but people graduate.  You don't have the same team anymore.  You guys are going to lose.  Hey, look at the rankings.  Look where Ohio State is.  I don't need to look at the rankings, sir.  Well, we have Terrell Pryor is a much better quarterback than Ohio State.  You sound like you have on Ohio State pajamas right now.  Well, a thong maybe, but, you know, that would be the extent of it. 
[02:18:00]  What's that, sir?  Yeah, you heard me.  Yeah, I love that.  Wow.  You know, Danny's putting up pictures of stadiums where they're just adding pieces that just don't look like it belongs.  Look at this one.  It doesn't look like it belongs.  That's where the Longhorns play, and Austin is the University of Texas.  I think they've added on to the stadium at least two or three times what it was originally designed for.  Who wants to fucking have people, like a newly built thing with 10,000 extra people over your head? 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, right on top of your head.  Yeah, built on top of something that was built before the Three Stooges.  No, but this is like the population is just completely out of control.  That's how you do it.  Like that lower part of that, the horseshoe, that's the original one.  Like, rah, rah, shish, boom, bah.  That's what it was.  Get a fucking raccoon coat, you know?  A banner.  23 skidoo.  Yeah.  You wore a sweater.  Yeah, now this is like just everybody just continuing to fuck.  We've out-fucked our highways. 
[02:19:00]  That's what I can tell you.  Just being, like, everywhere I go is L.A. traffic now.  Yeah.  Yep.  I absolutely lose my shit when I'm doing, like, afternoon radio to hype some gig and I'm stuck at, like, two in the afternoon.  I absolutely, I'm just like, where the fuck are all, aren't you guys should be at work?  I was in L.A. for the first half of the vacation this past, like, two weeks ago, whatever.  I was stunned.  Hey, thanks for calling.  Hey, no problem.  You know.  That was a colony one.  What's wrong with you, Bill?  I was hanging out with somebody.  Was it a casino off of the five? 
[02:19:30]  Oh, there you go.  I totally understand that.  You shouldn't have called me.  Good for you.  Good for you.  Did you bang her under the Hollywood sign?  Huh?  Did you get your tourist stuff in there?  Good for you.  I was actually at the Beverly Hills Hotel.  I stayed at the Beverly Hills Hotel for the week.  I'm one of the bungalows.  In the Jackie Gleason suite.  I'll have the and away we go burger.  What would you like, sweetheart?  I'll take the baby you're the greatest salad.  Oh, shit. 
[02:20:00]  That is so fucking true.  You say it's a tourist trap, Billy.  Oh, it's great.  No, they treat you like fucking gold in that place.  Of course they do.  You're out by the pool.  You can just picture, you know.  You got a robe.  A young fucking clock gable swimming around.  Ah, here we go.  The Beverly Hills Hotel.  Young fatty Arbuckle.  What do you think of the Spruce Ghost?  Is it going to be able to get off the ground?  I don't know. 
[02:20:30]  Let's see what it can do.  Lucky Lindy did pretty good last week.  Boy, boy, towel boy.  I'm a little wet over here.  Bring a lounge chair out for my best gal.  Ah, look.  Not a negro in sight.  Ah, the oldie days.  The oldie days.  It really does harken back to those days, though.  Have an argument who's better, Glenn Miller or Tommy Dorsey?  Yes, Tommy Dorsey. 
[02:21:00]  Much better.  No, no.  Cares.  It was great.  I had a good time.  But like you said, the fucking traffic.  Out of fucking control in L.A.  But at least L.A. continues to move.  There's nothing I've found worse than trying to get into the Lincoln Tunnel at like 445.  There's nothing worse than that.  What are they doing over there?  Or that they, because they have traffic, those stupid traffic fucking police that just fuck  traffic up.  What's the problem?  Is it just too many cars?  You're asking me, like the head of transportation over here? 
[02:21:30]  I have no idea.  I have no idea.  Bill Burr, head of transportation for New York.  No, it's too many people.  Penicillin is the problem.  Yeah.  It's given out too liberally.  Cures too many things.  It's a great idea.  Yeah, but yeah, we've gone against nature where the weak survive.  People are supposed to just drop dead.  Yes.  You can't survive if you're a dumb squirrel.  You die.  But if you're a human being, you continue living and you can procreate.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  Make a valid point.  Yeah, five even dumber people. 
[02:22:00]  Because how dumb is the broad who's going to fucking bang you?  Like let you enter her unprotected.  Yeah.  There you go.  These are just theories.  Opie, anything over there?  He's over there getting a thumb cancer.  I'm actually tweeting the Lyle Chip Chipperson fucking video for everybody.  I like what George Carlin said.  All right, I'm back, Billy.  You look at how stupid the average person is and realize half of the people on earth are more stupid than that. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, yeah.  It's perfect.  Yeah.  They're not contemplating the population problem.  No.  You are.  You realize, like, we're out fucking our highway system.  Yeah.  I think you and I and Jimmy, we should get tax breaks.  Yeah.  For being the ages that we are, we haven't brought anybody into this world.  That's right.  That would be good.  We should be allowed to have V8s with no fucking guilt.  Or at least we should get a fucking, a little, a little, like a certificate of merit for good aim.  For hitting the mouth and asshole consistently for over 40 years. 
[02:23:00]  For over 40 years.  Jesus.  I have no guilt.  I just got, uh, just got traded in my old Escalade.  Oh, you did?  Traded it in.  For a brand fucking new one.  That's great.  I have no problem with this.  There's no problem.  There's nothing wrong with a Hummer.  There's just too many people doing it.  So I don't think it's the engines.  It's the people.  You know what the thing comes with?  A sticker for, uh, it's, um, you're green. 
[02:23:30]  Like how green the vehicle is.  Oh.  On a scale of one to ten.  What did it get?  Ten being the best vehicle.  It got a one.  Jesus.  It just is an abomination for the planet.  And, uh, I could give a flying fuck.  Well, I was looking at that Dodge Challenger.  I was like, finally, all right, fuck this.  I'm going to get the one with the stick shift.  It's like a $1,300 gas guzzling fee.  I looked at all of them.  I'm like, Jesus Christ.  But this is the thing.  I rented one, uh, for the week. 
[02:24:00]  Just with the V6.  Which had no balls.  Yeah, yeah.  But it felt like a Hemi getting out of my Prius.  But it, it, like, there's no place to drive it in L.A.  Nah, where are you going to go?  There's nowhere to go.  You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you're just watching the needle going  all the way down to E.  You got an Arnold Schwarzenegger clutch leg.  Yeah.  Your fucking left leg is just fucking buff.  Yeah.  There was just no place to drive it. 
[02:24:30]  So now I'm thinking maybe I'll get, like, an old Impala, just a cruiser, just something  to drive around in.  Will that get a good green sticker, you think?  Um, no, I don't.  I think it'll get, like, a four.  Yeah, those things get, oof.  The Escalade.  Do you know the Enola Gay actually got a better rating than the Escalade?  Yeah, it's, uh, oof.  The thing does burn some fuel.  I don't mind.  And then the fucking, uh, the Mustang's great.  I got that, finally got that back from Rhode Island, where they were doing more work on  it.  And now it's just crazy. 
[02:25:00]  It's like, just about eight.  Rhode Island?  Did it still have the stereo in it when you got it back?  Yeah, I know.  What a miracle.  Yeah, there's a Shelby place up there, so, uh, I just had them do work, too.  It's just short 800.  Did they shine up the little snake on the side of your car?  Yes.  Yeah, they shined it up.  It's just short of 800 horse now.  Jesus.  At the rear wheels.  Where do you drive that?  Down, uh, ocean.  What's that mean, 800 horse?  Like, what is a good, I don't, I don't know.  It means it goes real fast.  It's 800 horse, right?  Because a lot of times, if it's 800 horse at the engine, um, it's not 800 at the rear wheels. 
[02:25:30]  You're losing, uh, a fuckload of pending.  Punch your horses just disappear in the sun, right?  Yeah, yeah, that's right, Chip.  But, uh, it's, it's fucking, it's so much fun to drive.  You, you, you floor the, it used to be like I'd get about nine pounds of boost out of the turbo when I would just.  I don't know what any of this means.  Me neither.  Oh, it's, it's how much air is just being compressed into the fucking engine.  See, most people would have tapped out at that moment.  I don't know what this means.  Oh, okay.  I guess I'm a little too, right?  We'll move on to something.  No, no, do you know why? 
[02:26:00]  Because we're not just talking to each other.  There's some gearheads out there.  I'm catering to the audience.  Not just everyone in here.  Oh, it just goes fast.  Fuck it.  All right, I mean, you win.  I'm tapping.  Yes, it goes fast.  It's great.  When you connect the aspirated tube to the universal joint, the differential.  It goes vroom, vroom.  I never forgot aspirator tube.  That was one time when I got fucked at Midas Muffler.  I went in and they fixed it and I got out and it was still loud.  And then I took to somebody else.  Hey, you got a busted aspirated tube. 
[02:26:30]  And I'm just looking at this moron going, this is the guy I have to fucking pay.  This fuckhead.  That's what made me start to learn about cars.  I'm like, if this idiot can do this for a living.  Hey, you got a busted aspirated tube.  You think they size you up and just say shit to you?  Oh, absolutely.  That you have no idea about?  Yeah.  I mean, for all I know, it doesn't even exist.  And you don't want to call them out on it because then you, you know what I mean?  Then you're going to look stupid.  Yeah.  Next time, whatever they tell me I need, I'm just going to yell the part back at them. 
[02:27:00]  You got a busted ass?  An aspirated tube?  Oh, fuck.  Well, listen, I can cut you a break.  Yeah, that'll be like, oh, fuck, he's on to me.  He knows what that is.  Fuck.  It's only a screw.  Oh, it's just the aspirated tube.  No matter what it is.  Right.  I think they just make shit up to see if you call them out.  Like, it doesn't exist.  Like, we got to put a colonic on in your engine.  And if you don't go, what the fuck is that?  If you're like, all right.  He goes, oh, this asshole wants me to think he knows what he's talking about.  Right.  And then he kills you.  That's what I would do.  I think that's happening. 
[02:27:30]  Colonic.  Let's hear from the mechanics.  We got mechanics listening to this show.  Yeah.  Are you fucking with us or what?  Of course we do.  Don't tell us.  Doctors, we don't have a list of lawyers.  You got some gambling debt?  Someone was saying where the Gators play, that stadium was made for 21,000 people, and  it now holds, like, 94.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  The swamp.  Proving your point.  Come on.  That cannot be safe.  Hmm?  That can't be safe.  Oh, I'm sure it passed all the Florida codes of building near a swamp. 
[02:28:00]  On a swamp.  How fucked up is it that guy was going to burn the Koran?  Like, he actually, that went international.  Like, he was the spokesperson for this country.  This guy had, like, it's like, if he just did that and you didn't report it, no one would  have known.  He would have been out there in the swamp.  By himself.  Make sure it doesn't catch the billet bass on fire either.  The billet bass.  I'm burning the Koran.  All right.  It got to the point where people actually, presidents of nations. 
[02:28:30]  The Pentagon called them up.  The Pentagon called them.  And this is what I love.  I love how he said, all right, I'm not going to do it.  And then all the TV vans and the satellites went down and drove away.  And he was like, wait a minute.  Maybe I will.  I want, can I have 16 seconds of fame?  But he said he's not going to do it and he'll never do it.  So what kind of talking did he get?  Oh, I think the Pentagon might have had a little message for him.  You think there was a little visit?  I can tell you right now, there was at least 30 people on other lines snickering during 
[02:29:00]  that phone call.  What's funny, because Jesus just called us, sir.  And he said, I'm a little busy to call that redneck down there in the swamp.  Oh, yeah.  He got to talk it to him because he seemed a little scared.  Yeah, he did seem really scared.  You want to make everyone know he'll never burn.  Yeah, he goes, I'm never doing it.  Actually, I'm a Muslim now.  I mean, they showed him a beheading video.  She probably never watched.  This is what they do.  I took him to the basement of the White House. 
[02:29:30]  I think it was a little bit easier.  They probably just said, you know, he's at church.  You know, he's not paying his taxes.  They just had the IRS call.  They found something.  They found something.  You're right.  Some sort of love interest.  There was no talk about tolerance for him, though.  No one talked about tolerance for that fucking pastor.  You didn't hear that one person saying, you have to show tolerance for an unpopular view.  I think the fact that they never called him an absolute moron and people actually discussed  whether he had the right, does he or does he not have the right, just as, I'm going to 
[02:30:00]  take a shit on the Torah.  Does he or does he not have a right?  Up first, Professor So-and-so from John Hopkins University.  Nobody's just saying this guy is a fucking moron.  Let's hear what the guy in the bleachers wants to do next.  You know, we have mechanics on the line.  We have to fucking go to him.  Okay.  Because they lie to us all the time, these motherfuckers.  Don't use your real name.  Danny, what stadium is that? 
[02:30:30]  That's the original?  This is Florida Field.  Yeah, Travis sent me this.  Is that the Gators?  Yeah, University of Florida.  That's the original stadium.  Look at the original one.  It's 21,000.  The marching way.  One tuba.  So they've added on since.  Is it the same place, too?  Yeah, now that is this.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, you can kind of see the original.  You got to get into college football is insane.  Like, they have a game every year, the Florida-Georgia game. 
[02:31:00]  They have to play it in Jacksonville.  They have to play in a neutral city because the violence and shit was just getting too fucking crazy.  Why don't they just not play?  What the hell is that about?  Why don't they just say you two teams can't play because your fans are assholes?  Relax.  Who cares?  It's a stupid game.  It's like the Red River rivalry game.  Oklahoma versus Texas.  Then they got to meet in Dallas.  Everybody feels like they're on a vacation.  I ain't that mad at you.  One for you guys. 
[02:31:30]  I never really got to Dallas.  Who do you think killed Kennedy?  I was down there today.  All right.  Here we go.  Mechanics.  We got Brooks in Kentucky.  Brooks.  All right.  We know how it's going to wind up for this guy.  Okay.  Brooks.  Brooks.  Good morning, fellas.  Yeah, there was this dick I went to high school with.  He was just always such a jerk, and he came into a shop.  I didn't even work at it, but a friend of mine did, and we're standing there.  The guy comes in and tells us he's got this problem. 
[02:32:00]  We installed muffler bearings.  Muffler bearings?  $49.95 for the parts and $60 for the labor.  We bought a bag of weed and a keg and had a party.  There's no such thing as muffler bearings.  At least not on old cars.  There's probably some on new cars.  Well, in the 70s, there definitely weren't.  No.  Oh, look at that.  All right.  Let's go to Mike in Maine. 
[02:32:30]  Mike.  Yes, sir.  Mike.  Hey, Mike.  What's going on, guys?  It's been that in a while.  Yeah.  You don't come up here and talk to a lobster like that.  Maine jokes.  Yes, sir.  You guys want to know about honesty with mechanics?  That's the only reason why we're taking your fucking phone call.  Yeah, well, you'll see that a lot more with independent shops because there's not too much  as far as regulations go.  But, like, I myself am a Ford-certified technician, and more of the guys that work at the dealerships 
[02:33:00]  tend to be a little bit more, have to be a little bit more honest through the, like,  warranty audits and this and that.  But you will see.  You will see.  James in Alabama.  What's up, James?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Listen, if you can Google this picture of the University of Alabama, Brian Denny Field,  back in the day, literally, there's a picture where you could pull up your Model T and watch  the game from the Model T.  And now, as of last weekend when they played Penn State, 102,000 people in this stadium 
[02:33:30]  that goes around the exact same 100 yards.  Yeah, someone is saying on feedback here, it used to hold 7,000 seats.  Yeah, you could look up.  God, I'm saying.  Look at what it looks like.  And it was a little field.  Get the fuck out of here.  I was like, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Ba-ba-ba-ba.  Is that?  Ba-na-ma-na.  What's that?  Before and after?  The before and after pictures of college football stadiums. 
[02:34:00]  That's a great thing to do today.  Do it on your own.  Unbelievable.  They just kept stacking them up.  Just keep stacking it.  You think they're done?  No, another tear.  Come on.  Well, that's the thing, too.  Then they always want to keep a part of the original stadium on some of those.  That's when it gets scary.  Like, the Cotton Bowl.  I took a tour of the Cotton Bowl.  That's how much of a fucking nerd I am.  I actually took a tour of it.  Do you love Cotton Bowl?  Yeah.  I got into it in the last three, four years.  So I take a tour of this thing.  We'll come walking into this monstrosity of a stadium.  So the first question I ask the person is, I go, how many people does this one hold? 
[02:34:30]  And she's like, like 26,000, 27,000.  Sitting there looking around.  You know, I think it's a little bit more than that.  It happens more than that.  And then she sits and she opens it up.  She goes, oh, I'm sorry, 97,000.  97,000.  And right there, all of her credibility was gone for the tour.  Now I have to throw out all of your testimony.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm just going to sort of meander away from the tour, if you don't mind. 
[02:35:00]  And do it on my own.  She was off by 70,000 people.  That's all.  Tell me.  She said, well, you know, they give us this stuff.  You know, we're supposed to re-memorize it.  She said it like three times.  You got to re-memorize it.  And I was like, yes.  Re-memorize.  Re-memorize.  I was like, okay.  Thank you.  She was cool, but I was just like, all right.  She was a dud.  Should have raped her.  Jesus, Jimmy.  Why?  That's what she gets.  She'll learn those numbers next time.  In a perfect world, Jimmy.  In a perfect world.  She's in the hospital having her asshole sutured shut. 
[02:35:30]  She'll remember 97,000.  Sutures.  She'll never make that mistake again, right, Jimmy?  Exactly.  You got to teach abroad sometimes.  Bill gives her a fucking good pounding, a good violent fuck, which is much more about  anger than sex.  Punched to the side of the face.  Falls out of the upper deck.  God, you'd get in so much trouble for that.  Oh, would you?  You think?  Comedian rapes tour guide for wrong facts. 
[02:36:00]  You think that would be a problem?  Then you'd be that classic.  Not the comedians.  That classic comic who just, you know, every groan is political correctness.  You raped her and threw her off a balcony.  You're fucking politically correct.  Kevin in Jersey.  Loosen up.  Kevin.  Morning, fellas.  What's up?  Bill Burr in studio, by the way.  We used to sell summer air and winter air to the brothers.  $10 a tire.  This is what mechanics used to do.  Summer air and winter air. 
[02:36:30]  Or they're still doing it.  Good Lord.  You could have sold that to me.  That's good.  Look at the hiney.  Come on.  Of course you got to sexually harass her.  Imagine a nice fucking log coming out of there like a Manx cat tail.  Oh my God.  What do you think of that, Bill?  You're a sports guy.  You like the hot reporters on the sidelines and in the locker rooms.  But you know what?  The thing was, it turns out that she wasn't even offended.  They kind of made the whole thing up.  Well, they're trying to make it more of a big deal.  She knows.  She knows people looking at her ass.  She accepted the apology, which rarely happens in this world, by the way.  She's usually dealing with Mexican men.  She bills herself as the sexiest sports reporter on Mexico. 
[02:37:00]  So it's like you're selling sex.  Yeah.  And what did they do?  A couple of cat calls?  Yeah.  Yeah, they weren't even grabbing an ass.  I think a football whiz by her, though.  Hubba hubba.  I think they threw a football.  Auga.  Yeah, it was a football thrown or something.  No, yeah.  She didn't have to block it or anything.  No, no.  They kept overthrowing it so it would land near.  They weren't throwing it at her.  They were throwing it at her.  Oh, they want her to bend over?  No, so the player would have to go run over and be like, hey there, sweet tits.  They're all taking their shot, right? 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, taking a look at her.  Hey, how are you, madam?  And hoping they could get into that.  Lay on her belly and tee up the ball in her asshole.  Her ass looks like she got butt cheeks and plants.  Yes, exactly.  It doesn't look real.  No, it looks odd.  That's that Hispanic blood, man.  Yeah, no, no.  I understand that.  They're growing nice ass.  I know, but usually they're standing on some thighs that are a little thicker than that.  You know, you've got to have a foundation.  You could come in her without even fucking her.  You could just put your dick between her cheeks and just kind of dry hump it.  Yeah.  Fucking lubricate it with anything.  Fucking pine cones. 
[02:38:00]  You don't know how awful that would be.  It wouldn't matter on that ass.  You're going to see.  I can't add this needles.  Oh my God, can you imagine?  Look, is that her?  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Every picture is hotter than that.  Yeah, come on.  She looks like a stripper.  White pants.  Yeah, exactly.  She looks like a stripper.  Of course.  How could you say that?  Because you look like a stripper.  But you're right.  She's not the one complaining, though.  It's more.  I know.  These are the dumb Americans.  Because again, what do you think?  Mexican men are polite to her? 
[02:38:30]  Oh my God.  They must really hoot and holler at her.  They're all height-wise right up to her about her ass cheeks.  Put their little black-haired faces into it.  We all have black hair.  I get it?  Yeah.  Because they do.  They do.  Very dark hair.  Look at this stadium.  LSU?  Looks like it's going to fly away.  Jesus.  Oh, LSU.  LSU's got a big one.  LSU's got a big one.  Used to have 15 seats.  I know. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, and then they added that and whatever the hell.  They got another Olympic track.  Dome.  Yeah.  And then what they do now, like they did in Dallas, they put the huge fucking screen in  and then these things could be as big as your imagination, right?  As big as your imagination.  Well, I know.  Jesus.  Now, hold on.  Mr. Blizzard wants to make a point.  Let Willy Wonka talk.  I think you guys are being too hard on him.  Can you continue your point? 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, exactly.  How big can a boy dream?  Go.  Thank God.  I just returned from vacation, so you can't see how red I am right now.  Thank God.  It's covered up by the sunburn I got the last two weeks.  Oh, they're calling you Doug Henning.  Oh, God.  As big as your imagination.  That's a big stadium.  You have a big imagination.  Oh, you bully.  Yeah, sometimes they just pop out, don't they? 
[02:40:00]  As big as your imagination.  Opie, do you miss daydreaming in your childhood?  Yes.  Look at how embarrassed he's getting.  This is awesome.  As big as your...  That's not bad.  As soon as I said it, I saw Jimmy's eyes.  Well, because you said as big as your imagination.  And we're all like, that's pretty darn big, Opie.  Because I couldn't come up with a good word.  Imagination.  Sure.  Look at Opie trying to look at the TVs, just avoiding any sort of eye contact.  I'm not looking at you.  It's all right.  Fuck you, Bill.  Everyone has a big imagination. 
[02:40:30]  Bill does.  I do.  I imagine a flying stadium.  You know what I liked about it?  That was his heart talking.  It really was.  The heart's coming out.  It's a boy's imagination.  Becoming a father is really fucking up the radio show for me.  It's okay, Opie.  All right.  Bill Burr, we're going to take a break.  Why?  To get me out of this.  Why?  Oh, come on.  We're all just going to sit here and daydream a bit.  I used to love watching butterflies. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, just floating around.  I like butterflies.  Imagine what it would be like to be one.  Yeah.  Just use your imagination.  That imagination is endless.  You flutter around the yard and some kid who's been raped by his stepfather hits you  with a Zip-Zap paddle.  Oh, my God.  He's just trying to be pretty and colorful.  Some abused kid fucking rips your wings off.  Being a butterfly would suck dicks.  I hate it.  That would be a Japanese hornet. 
[02:41:30]  Well, I think we're going to...  Should we break?  Break and talk about unicorns and rainbows.  It really should.  That's what Rafio was suggesting.  Play a little Candyland.  What he said should be like a cheesy tattoo at a tattoo parlor.  Yeah.  No, like right above it.  Whatever tattoo you want.  As big as your imagination.  It can be a stadium, but as long as the screen is put in, people, it's as big as your imagination. 
[02:42:00]  And this is how good Travis is.  This is Keys to Your Imagination.  Keys to the Imagination by Yanni.  Yanni.  Off the CD, Keys to the Imagination.  I sometimes dream of a stadium where no game even has to be played.  It just brings people together.  You can think these things too if you use your imagination.  The power of imagination. 
[02:42:30]  I imagine that one set of the stands is on the Pacific Ocean and one set is on the Atlantic Ocean.  And we're all watching the game together.  That is as big as you can imagine.  That's my imagination.  There would be no losers.  Everyone would win.  It's always a tie.  Travis, you know what I imagine?  You rewinding and playing Opie saying that.  I think it's good to hear.  Why can't you inspire us twice? 
[02:43:00]  Let's just hear it again.  Oh my God, Opie Mr. Rogers Hughes.  Find that clip or you're going to imagine my fist in your gums.  Oh, you are not going to be comfy listening to this.  Because it sounded like there was a moment of thought.  I couldn't think of a word.  Any word would have been better. 
[02:43:30]  In all languages, as big as your logs, Down syndrome, kid's tongue, tumor.  I fucked up with the word.  Rap sheet.  Anything would have been better than imagination.  Here we go.  Wait, can you play it with the music?  I think I might bring it all together.  Oh no.  No, I need to just hear this.  Let's hear it naked first.  First, let's hear it naked.  Then we'll hear it with the music.  Here we go.  Oh no.  And what they do now, like they did in Dallas, they put the huge fucking screen in and then  these things could be as big as your imagination, right? 
[02:44:00]  Okay.  You also looked for acceptance.  Right?  Because I paused.  Right, guys?  No, because he knew it came out of his mouth, his imagination.  Right, guys?  Right?  Everybody, all right, you'll be an Anthony show.  We're going to break.  Oh boy.  I wanted that one back badly.  I wanted that one back.  I heard the pause.  I needed a word.  No, but you know what's great, Opie, is I think that we've gotten all the laughs that  we can out of it.  Shut up, Bill.  Shut up.  I don't think that this will happen.  Shut up, Bill. 
[02:44:30]  I don't think it's going to go viral.  Thanks.  Why?  This guy's like, when I grow up, I want to be on radio.  That's what I imagined.  Yes.  You can too.  But not just any radio show.  A radio show that inspires beyond your wildest dreams.  An imagination.  Without limit.  Close your eyes and try and find your center.  It just turns your center. 
[02:45:00]  Do you hear that voice?  I've lived in L.A. too long, Bill.  You're on a beach.  The warm sun is on your face.  Bill has tried to find his center.  You're a cracker in the middle of a room.  A bunch of men are standing around you.  This is really uncomfortable.  Take off your shoes and wiggle your toes in the sand.  Get in touch with Mother Earth.  It's all possible when you use your imagination.  That's when we notice we're getting old. 
[02:45:30]  When we stop using our imaginations.  Be a child again.  And just imagine like you used to.  The world is your oyster.  Enjoy the sounds of nature.  The flutter of a bird's wings.  The panting of your dog.  Bill?  Do you have nature CDs?  A stadium so big a million people could think of it. 
[02:46:00]  It's a big stadium.  I think a zillion people.  I imagine the whole universe cheering for one thing.  Well, when you use your imagination, guys, there's no limits.  Opie, let's imagine being treated fairly by the company.  I don't think we can.  No, that's where the imagination ends.  Yeah, the human mind doesn't actually go that far.  You can't wrap around it. 
[02:46:30]  Here at Disney, our Imagineers come up with the characters you see on all the attractions.  Thank you, by the way.  Is there a South Park imagination song?  Danny, you're a South Park guy, right?  Is there an imagination song that needs to be played?  You know what's funny about what you did?  That's like a moment that just ruins your pussy career in high school.  Just one stupid fucking word. 
[02:47:00]  And you're like, ah, maybe I'll get laid in college.  I'll ride this out for another two and a half years.  Write it off.  Gotta write it off.  All right, let me hear this.  Imagination.  Imagination.  It is kind of a spoof on Willy Wonka there.  Oh, please.  It never ends.  It's a great story.  What happened? 
[02:47:30]  I can't.  I'll tell you on the break.  It's not about the imagination thing.  No, no.  I imagine.  But there was more?  Of course.  Why wouldn't there be?  What's that about?  I'll tell you.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Imagination.  Yeah.  Imagine the head being severed.  Yes.  I can figure it out. 
[02:48:00]  Hey, Bill, have you ever shit outdoors?  Have I ever shit outdoors?  Yeah, absolutely.  Will you help me out?  They're doing their own shit.  I forgot my...  Because they can't bring it to the show, so they might as well have fun with it, with  each other.  I forgot my house key one day.  Latch key kid.  I forgot my house key.  It came home.  I didn't have it.  I had to take a shit.  Oh, what'd you do it?  In the woods, where every suburban kid did it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What'd you use to wipe with?  Leaves.  Someone's dick.  Don't leave. 
[02:48:30]  I was in the fourth grade.  I didn't know any better.  Oh, no.  I mean as an adult.  Yeah.  Oh, as an adult.  No.  I was shitting outdoors on vacation.  Yeah.  He was shitting on the beach.  What?  Why?  There's like no cover, no concealment.  Because it was a five-minute walk back to the house.  And you took a vile human shit.  Yeah.  A vile.  And then...  No, like our food is so bad that our shit is actually poison.  Anything else takes a shit in nature and grass grows. 
[02:49:00]  Not ours.  Ours makes everything turn ill of it.  That's a great point.  No, there's no problem with our food.  Quarter pound of cheese.  Tricks.  Just go ahead and kill shit.  Any other animal does it.  It's fertilizer.  Fucking whales are beaching themselves.  It's fucking fertilizer, right?  They don't use human shit for fertilizer.  Absolutely not.  I think the worst part of your shit, though, is when you said you picked it up and threw  it in the ocean.  Well, because I realized...  Like people swim there.  No, I was in the Outer Banks and it's a four-by-four beach and we all bring our cars down to the 
[02:49:30]  beach.  Picked it up with what?  You made an Edward G. Robinson.  His imagination.  I had a cardboard, little cardboard box in the back of my car or whatever, my SUV.  So I ripped off the lids or whatever.  And how did you wipe your ass?  You just went in the ocean and sort of pelvic pumped?  I kind of made sure I was spreading nice.  So he's still saying...  That's disgusting.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's just...  I've heard enough.  He's still got a wipe.  And then I scooped it up with my makeshift shovel and threw it in the ocean. 
[02:50:00]  And that's when my brother came over the dune and saw what I was doing.  What did he say?  Little fish pecking at his asshole.  Like it's tetra food in your tank.  One catfish slithering up his colon.  He said he thought I was throwing away an egg sandwich.  The rest of my egg sandwich.  God, that is just disgusting.  I just thought I was walking back to the house.  It was... 
[02:50:30]  How far was the house?  Nah, there's just really...  Five minutes tops.  Five minutes tops.  Walk to the house.  Five minutes tops.  I thought you were going to be with me on this one.  But I guess not.  No, you can't.  No one can be with me.  That's one of the most insulting things you've ever said to me.  That I wanted to bond with you with a shit story?  The fact that you would have thought that I was...  Of that sort of constitution that I could do something like that.  I look in your eyes.  We're kind of alike in a lot of ways.  So I thought you might shit outside.  Just because we both have a temper doesn't mean...  I'm going to shit on a beach. 
[02:51:00]  Not wipe my ass.  That's what people with tempers do.  They shit in holes.  What was your technique?  Oh, I'll tell you.  You just grabbed your butt cheeks like a fucking porn star?  Like I said, I had my car, so my hat...  Gaping.  My hat was open.  Exactly.  Gaping analog.  You ever done triceps in the gym on a bench?  Absolutely I have, but I didn't shit on a beach while I was doing them.  That was the position.  Oh, that is so disgusting.  Are you saying you never shit onto a piece of cardboard and then shot-putted it into the sea? 
[02:51:30]  Presented it like potato skins at a sports bar?  The best one from yesterday, though, is where I didn't read the tide charts and I threw one into the ocean.  This was a couple years ago, and it spread all over the beach.  I thought I was going to take it out to sea.  And that's when the mother-in-law was coming back from a walk with her sister-in-law.  So it came back?  She didn't understand why all the birds were feasting.  A little Coke bottle with a note in it? 
[02:52:00]  Sorry, Bill.  Yeah, this is just gross.  Yeah, it is disgusting.  You don't need to hear this.  It's raw sewage.  It doesn't matter how much or how little of it.  But you're making a point.  You know how hilarious it would be if he got caught dumping raw sewage into the ocean?  Right out of his ass.  What raw sewage?  His.  His.  EPA is just writing him a ticket.  Shock jock defecates.  Historical beach. 
[02:52:30]  Come on, man.  Come on.  There's horse shit all over the place.  Why not find a little human shit?  It's a big deal.  I did the right thing.  I threw it in the ocean.  You're going to laugh my ass off.  And I'm not Opie Lennon, by the way.  Fuck you.  Oh, imagine.  Fuck you.  Oh, that's great.  Imagine there's a stadium.  It's easy if you try.  Plenty of toilets. 
[02:53:00]  I just saw open beach, man.  Just a wide open beach.  Yeah.  That's wonderful.  I did the right thing, though.  I didn't bury it.  You really didn't.  I didn't bury it.  You didn't do the right thing would have been to walk back to the house like a gentleman.  Exactly.  Like a human.  Five minutes, man.  Take a shit in a toilet.  Five fucking minutes.  Five fucking minutes.  How long did it take you to go back to your car to go get the piece of cardboard box?  The car was right there.  Yeah, where'd the cardboard come from?  I told you, a little box in the back.  Were you with anybody? 
[02:53:30]  No, of course not.  There was no one in sight.  My brother came over the dune as I was, you know, walking into the ocean.  Great.  I got to get him on the show, Scott.  He saw the whole fucking thing go down.  Or the last part of it, whatever.  Yeah, my bathroom is as big as my imagination.  There you go.  The ocean.  I really thought you were going to be with me on this one, Bill.  Very disappointed.  Do you watch too many of those man versus wild shows? 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  Just sort of living that.  Drink your own urine.  Yeah.  You've never camped.  You've got to shit when you're out in nature.  Yeah, you take toilet paper with you.  Yeah, but if there was a fucking five-minute walk to a toilet in Yellowstone, I'd go use it.  Thank you.  You proved my point.  Five-minute walk.  But here it is, too.  The woods are different than the beach.  No, I was saying I would go use it.  Yeah, you could dig a hole by a tree if you're camping.  You take toilet paper with you.  You do that, and you bury it in shit.  I'd actually just shit on the sand and wait for someone in my family to sit back and put  their hand in it. 
[02:54:30]  It's my greatest moment when Mark Rosenberg was sitting in the lawn, and he put his hands  back, and he put his hand in fresh, mocha-colored dog shit.  That dog must have had cancer, too.  It was a horrible shit.  It gets in between the fingers?  Dude, it literally put his handprint in it before his hand hit the fucking bottom of  the grass.  Did it wreck his day?  It couldn't have been a fresher pile of shit if he had reached in and took it out of the  dog's colon.  Oh, that just wrecked his day, right?  Dude, his day was ruined. 
[02:55:00]  I guarantee you, that's 1974.  He's probably still smelling on his hand.  It's the greatest thing I've ever seen.  You don't have a good shit story, Bill?  Oh, yeah.  We all told our greatest shit stories once on the show.  It was great.  It's so fucking...  Whew.  God, is that funny?  Goddamn, Jimmy.  Like when I had a fucking log break off, I was at Bill D'Angelo's house on Newton Street.  We were walking to school.  I used to hate shitting anywhere but home, and I had a piece that was fighting its way 
[02:55:30]  out.  So I clenched it, and a little tip broke off.  And I treated that shit the way Muslims treat infidels.  And a fucking piece of it rolled down my legs.  It's true.  And I kicked it out, and Bill saw a little duty ball kick out on Newton Street.  It was a line of shit probably down your leg.  No, no, no.  From the rolling...  It was just one little piece. 
[02:56:00]  Dan in Florida.  Go ahead, Dan.  Yeah, don't forget to let Bill know how you wipe your ass when you're in the water.  Well, but not this time.  That was a past vacation.  Then no one's around, so I quickly take off my clothes, jump in the ocean, and then wipe  my ass.  With his hand.  Like an animal.  You're an animal, Opie.  It's a five-minute walk.  I always considered you as crazy as this show was.  It was just sort of, you know, it's a show.  And then when the show was over, I thought Opie, the Opie the adult came out. 
[02:56:30]  I'm one with nature, man.  There's a fucking pelican covered with Opie shit.  Green pieces wiping him off with some Dawn detergent.  Oh, God.  You've never wiped your ass if you're in a pool, or maybe not a pool.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, a pool.  You get a little itchy back there.  What do you do?  You get a hand down there.  Oh, no.  You know one of those little things in a church that people put their hands in for holy water?  Hey, yeah.  You ever shit in a baptism?  You've never taken care of it. 
[02:57:00]  No.  You ever shit in a fish tank?  You've never taken care of your itchy ass in a fucking thing of water?  Whether it's a pond, an ocean, maybe a pool?  You know, give it a good rub to get rid of the itch?  You know, there are so many public bathrooms with toilets and toilet paper around.  It's a five-minute walk.  Wow.  What if it's ten minutes?  Then fuck that.  Jesus Christ.  Pissing in your own mouth?  That's what I ask these guys.  How long of the walk back to the house before you shit in a hole in nature? 
[02:57:30]  Dude, it would have to literally be to the point of, oh, my God, if I don't go right now, I'm going to shit myself.  Right.  Then nature loses.  That's how I felt on vacation, but it was a five-minute walk.  What, Jimmy?  You know, you were just lazy.  You were just sitting there, ah, I'm not going to walk all the way back to the house.  Of course you're lazy.  Nobody's around.  I'll wait to go home to, you know, do the right thing now.  So disappointing.  I'm not on vacation anymore.  Really disappointed in you, Greg. 
[02:58:00]  Don't use my real name.  That's not the way we raised you.  Hey, Opie, imagine my disappointment.  I guess I'm wrong.  I guess I'm wrong.  I'm going to ask Voss tomorrow.  See him tomorrow.  That disgusting Voss will probably have a similar story.  Out of all the comedians we know, I think Bob Kelly will agree with me. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, that's funny.  Bob's squeamish.  Bob was also molested.  Remember tomorrow, ask Bob about the steak story.  The steak story.  Yes, before I forget.  Mark Maron tomorrow?  Mark Maron is...  Oh, yeah, tomorrow?  He's shit.  He's filthy.  He shit's outdoors.  Yeah, that's no doubt in my mind.  Voss, I'm not really sure.  For drugs, he probably did.  Oh, he's probably taking some fucking coke shits.  Here's Brother Joe.  Brother Joe! 
[02:59:00]  Oh, no.  I can't even fucking believe I'm doing this with you guys, but here you go.  Anthony knows I'm lactose intolerant.  I'm racially intolerant.  Yeah, well, you know.  But I was...  This is going back years ago, coming home from a gig.  Jesus Christ.  I was sitting in my fucking car in traffic, and it was stopped.  And, I mean, you couldn't even, like, jump off the side of the road and run into the woods.  It was just...  It was fucking stopped.  And I had to let an entire fucking load of lactose intolerant shit go in my pants. 
[02:59:30]  Come on!  In the fucking car, dude.  I'm serious.  In the car.  Vinyl seats or cloth?  I had to throw it in park and ran.  Come on.  No, there was no way you could do it.  You couldn't throw it in park.  You couldn't get off the side of the road.  I was, like, on...  I think I was, like, on the BQE.  There's, like, no shoulder.  Nothing.  I couldn't.  There was nothing.  Like, shit over the edge.  So it goes on somebody's car driving under the overpass.  Yes. 
[03:00:00]  See?  That was a big fucking bird.  What was even worse was the whole way home, I had to, like, press my feet against the fucking  floorboards.  Yeah.  I asked to keep my ass off the seat from sitting down in my own load of shit when I  got home.  Were you at least...  When I got home.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  My girlfriend was at the apartment.  This was back in East North Port.  My girlfriend was at the very, very small apartment that I lived in at the time on Clay  Fitz Road.  And I ran into the fucking bathroom, and I had no idea what to do with all this shit 
[03:00:30]  in my fucking underwear.  So I had to throw...  Yeah, I had one of those.  I had small windows, because it was a basement of Armin.  I had to throw it out the fucking bathroom window, and eight of the fucking cats that lived  in the house that I was renting from made a beeline for this fucking window.  And the owner ended up discovering...  I buried the underwear, like, right outside the bathroom window. 
[03:01:00]  But the owner ended up discovering this shitload of fucking damn underwear.  He probably thought he was renting to a serial killer.  Animal.  Cats were fucking lunching on it.  Yes.  Oh, God.  Yes.  Yes.  It was a fucking disgusting experience in my life.  And the shower afterwards was not much.  Look, man, I'll tell you this much.  If you want to feed the birds at the ocean, the fucking, you know...  Shit in the... 
[03:01:30]  Shit in the water, let it wash up on shore.  Joe, when you took a shower, did it look like the murder scene from Psycho?  I hear Hitchcock used Hershey's syrup for blood.  No, black dose intolerant.  See, me and Joe are the same guy.  Same guy right here.  Goddamn disgusting.  I'm on my way home.  No, no, he had no choice.  I never shit in my pants.  Well, don't shit yourself, man.  Have fun.  Take it easy.  I've literally shit in my pants 75 times. 
[03:02:00]  Dude, I can't remember as a 14-year-old, my mother refused to clean shit out of my fucking  underwear anymore, and I would stand there and just scrub my underwear together.  Why are you shitting in your underwear?  Why weren't you is the question.  Where did this come from?  I don't know.  I just would hold it in, and it's cold.  That's what I see.  You just come up with an excuse, trying to roll with it.  Well, why were you doing that?  It was the 70s.  That's what people did.  They shit themselves.  Dr. Steve got to say. 
[03:02:30]  Happy birthday to Dr. Steve.  Tell Joe to get some lactate for God's sake.  That's what I drink.  Yes, lactate.  Because it will move the mucus.  He had what is called a fecal discharge of the colon.  Well, you have to, uh, well, yeah, the fecal matter will, uh, yeah, it'll move.  Jimmy's Dr. Steve is great.  But the lactate will, uh, stop it.  Um, yeah, I mean, you might want to call your physician.  Doesn't he do the best Dr. Steve? 
[03:03:00]  Because he does that fasting that Dr. Steve does?  And then the mellow, slower Dr. Steve.  But we don't, we don't really know exactly what.  Ah, that fucking painful droll.  Oh, Jesus.  He's like listening to eye surgery.  Ah, fuck.  God damn.  Right on, man.  Doesn't really matter. 
[03:03:30]  Everyone has their shit stories.  Shot.  Of course.  We don't need shit stories there, right?  I love Steve.  I think we've told him.  Steve's great.  He's a boob.  A boob.  He really is.  You ever have a nugget?  I've never seen his medical license, by the way.  He's very smart, man.  He's allegedly a doctor.  He's just some fucking creep who sits at home and is a great Googler.  I think we've all been scammed.  He's on WebMD.  Yeah.  Yeah, I've always wondered about that.  How do you go from being like in a hospital operating to being in show business? 
[03:04:00]  Like that fucking guy on Oprah.  Oh, where he wears the fucking...  The scrubs, so you know he's a doctor.  Yeah, yeah.  He's got to wear scrubs on Oprah.  Like he's going to be performing some kind of procedure on Oprah.  He looks like a guy going to a Halloween party dressed as a doctor.  No, but at what point?  At what point are you like operating?  You're like, you know what?  This isn't enough for me.  I want groupies.  I want to do some book signings. 
[03:04:30]  Ask Dr. Oz.  Look, yeah, he's in his scrubs.  He's ready to do a full fucking pelvic exam on Oprah.  I hate Dr. Oz.  Not a fan of the doctor.  No, I hate it.  Bill's right.  His stupid scrubs annoy me.  It's not enough that they call him Dr. Oz.  It's like I get it.  Exactly.  Right.  Do you walk around with headphones on?  He's a shock jock.  How are you?  That's a great point.  Let me say...  He's fucking dressing like your job.  Like they're children. 
[03:05:00]  What does the cow say?  Richard, PA, what's up?  Hey, got to call you out on something.  You said it's a five-minute walk.  Yeah.  Your car was there.  I know, but that's even more of a hassle to get back in the car and drive it back to the house.  No, is that a hassle?  It's right there.  It's on the beach.  It's four by four.  It's a five-minute walk.  It's a two-minute drive.  There's no one there, you said.  Then you get more sand in your car.  He just really...  The caliber of family that you grew up in, in my mind, has dropped by like 30%. 
[03:05:30]  You don't know my childhood stories?  Oh, they're horrible.  Watch it out, boys.  No, no, no.  I understand.  I got horrible childhood stories, too, but I was...  Did you think this was the result of a healthy upbringing?  Right.  No, no.  I understood the anger, but like...  I mean, that's carnival-esque.  That really is.  Carnival-esque.  Yeah, that's like really, really, really, really white trashy.  But I'll explain.  White trashy.  To drive back to the house, my coffee's in a mug, and then I got to put it back in the 
[03:06:00]  car, and now it's going to spill all over the place, because you're hitting bumps on  the...  Nothing you can say is worse than I shit on the beach.  I don't care if you had boric acid in your hat.  There's no reason to not drive back and shit in the toilet.  The coffee, the car, the sand, none of it could be worse than shitting on it.  Just sitting there, pulling down your bathing suit.  No, just sweats, but no underwear.  Just grunting on the beach. 
[03:06:30]  What the fuck, man?  How good would it be if a jellyfish stung his colon and his balls?  The sound of that load fucking hitting the fucking sand.  Plop, plop.  The dull thud.  Yeah, the dull thud.  All the little sand crabs going, what the fuck is happening?  The panic, the panic of hearing his brother's fucking moped coming in the distance.  When you take the toilet out of taking a shit, it's very interesting. 
[03:07:00]  That's not a good way.  When you take the plane out of flying, it's also interesting.  It hit in the sand.  It's very strange.  I don't like how you're trying to act like you were doing some sort of experiment.  Yeah, like you were getting in touch with nature.  My research.  And without water, man.  Wow.  It smells instantly.  Oh, God.  I had a dog shit in my lobby yesterday.  Because the dog walker couldn't get him outside, and the dog was already in shit move.  The dog walker should have grabbed that fucking piece of garbage by the eyes. 
[03:07:30]  Shit in that million dollar lobby.  Fucking four-legged cunt animal.  I hope that fucking dog, I hope it's just a bloody leash right now.  What did he do?  He fucking went and got a thing and wiped it up, and it smelled like sick shit.  It was terrible.  It's like Swayze's last dump.  What?  What happened?  What happened?  Nothing.  I just saw some hottie talking about stocks.  Oh, fuck. 
[03:08:00]  Holy shit.  It was fucking horrendous.  The whole lobby had a stick.  Dude, that fucking dog, that fucking nervous mutt couldn't make it out.  And he's just nervous.  You know how ashamed the dog was to be shitting by the UPS packages?  Did he do the little spin first?  No, he knew he was wrong.  He knew he couldn't make eye contact with anyone.  He knew he was fucking wrong.  I like when they're sitting there with their rear legs shaking, and with their tongue going...  Their tongue's going in and out, and they're shaking, taking a dump. 
[03:08:30]  That dog's been in and out of that lobby a hundred times, and he said,  I've never seen another dog doing this here.  And yet his little nervous stomach...  It was a fucking putrid shit.  You ever shit on the sidewalk in Manhattan?  I was going to ask you, have you ever shit in the lobby, Opie?  Just because you didn't want to ride the elevator up to your apartment?  I once shit on the sidewalk.  No, you didn't.  Swear to God, I had a...  No, you didn't.  How were you going to do that?  I swear to God, I swear to God. 
[03:09:00]  It was late at night, coming home.  I had something that didn't agree with me.  There was no bathrooms around.  I was walking.  Where?  It was a gurgly stomach.  I bet it was the sidewalk.  It was on the east side.  You're in New York, and you couldn't find...  It's New York City.  Oh, that is real.  But New York City, no, when you have to take a shit...  No, man, it's not as easy as you think.  You are a man without a country.  So it was...  If I remember correctly, it was like...  You have to buy something first.  It was a parking garage right off the side of the parking garage on the sidewalk. 
[03:09:30]  Hey, wait a minute.  My parking garage, the old one?  No, no.  I looked at a dump there that was decomposing for a year.  Every day I'd look at it in a different state of decomposition.  It was a guy that couldn't find a bathroom.  You should have taken one picture every day.  I was thinking that.  You would have won an award.  That would have been great, yeah.  Ah, fuck it.  That story's for another day.  What happened?  Oof, ha.  I had a gurgly stomach.  That one I had no choice.  Percolating pretty good. 
[03:10:00]  It was bad.  Or I would have been in a Brother Joe situation.  Shit is pants.  God, even I never heard that one.  Cop shit is pants.  The cop shit is pants.  Remember that?  Pulpit Grandy Village?  It's a great movie.  That fucking dog.  Dude, you know what dog shit smells like?  You know what the difference between when a shit is this bad smell, but then there's  that sick smell, like you could tell the animal.  That's like nature's way of letting everybody around, don't fuck this thing. 
[03:10:30]  It's dying.  It's dying.  Something's very wrong.  Oh, God.  Oh, can we play the George Brett fucking shit story going into the break?  You've heard this, right, Bill?  George Brett talking about it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's shitting.  It's great.  We'll end this shitty segment with that.  And I was going to show you this picture that I saw walking down the street in L.A.  There was a busted fax machine, a Dr. Pepper can, and then a bunch of Oreo cookie with  someone who had just eaten the cream off of. 
[03:11:00]  What the fuck?  And a plastic fork.  Just laying on the ground.  On the sidewalk.  Let me see it.  Let me see it.  It's an odd little mix.  Let me see it.  Of items.  Can I see your phone?  No, because you're going to smash it.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, Jesus.  That looked like snakes on a plane.  Me and Bill showed each other pictures.  Snakes in a toilet.  Jimmy just put his phone right in front of Bill's face, and I'm sure it was a giant shit  in a toilet.  No, it was like a bouquet of shit.  It was like a Medusa. 
[03:11:30]  It looked like Rasta shit.  As opposed to this.  Like, this one's different.  It's almost like a clay sculpture.  Marked for death.  See?  That's a different one.  It's not bad, right?  That actually looks like dog shit.  Do you eat Alpo sandwiches?  I can't take this fucking conversation.  And we don't know why SiriusXM doesn't want to pay us.  Kyle in Michigan.  Opie on a city bus all alone in the middle of the night took a shit in a bucket in the 
[03:12:00]  back of the bus that the ice scraper and Squeegee were sitting in.  Let me see.  I'm taking a shit.  I want to see it.  Come on.  Oh, God.  I see it.  I see it.  All right.  Well, let's take a break.  Bill Burr.  I like to laugh, too.  I know, but it's...  Shit pictures are hilarious.  There's no smell.  It's just 100% comedy.  Bill Burr, the big comedy central special is called Let It Go this Sunday at 11 o'clock.  11 p.m.  My best work to date, if I do say so myself. 
[03:12:30]  Very happy with how it came out, huh?  Yes, I am.  Let It Go comes out on DVD October 5th, but you can see it this Sunday night at 11 p.m.  on Comedy Central.  More with Bill Burr after the break.  Danny's shit looks like it perspires.  Right side.  Back to the right, gentlemen.  Both hands.  Right side.  Pardon.  To the left side.  I shit my pants last night.  I did.  Went out and had a great meal.  Just a great fucking meal.  I had to go to the bathroom.  So bad in the car.  I'm going, travel, hurry up, man. 
[03:13:00]  I got to shit.  I had fucking shit in my pants.  I'm good twice a year for that.  When was the last time you shit your pants?  Me?  Yeah.  Been a while?  It's been a while.  I was in Vegas a couple years ago.  Just an honest-to-god-true story.  Staying at the Bellagio.  I went over to Mirage for dinner.  Met some friends of mine over there.  Went to Kokomo's.  A great little steakhouse.  The guy brings out some fresh crab legs.  He just came in.  I got to give them to you guys.  I'm eating them. 
[03:13:30]  Then we go play gamble a little bit.  I had a tea time early in the morning.  So I said, look, I got to get going.  I'm walking back to the hotel.  I get three-quarters of the way out of the lobby.  All of a sudden, I go, oh, fuck.  And I'm standing here like this.  I got my butt pinched so fucking...  I'm fucked.  I can't move.  All of a sudden, you know, felt all right.  I went just like this.  Water.  I had some food poisoning from the crabs.  Take off my leather jacket. 
[03:14:00]  Tied it around my waist.  I'm just standing there.  And it's just running down my leg.  I got jeans on, black bucks, no socks.  And I just start fucking walking.  Every time I'm walking, something's coming out.  It's water.  Straight fucking water.  Then, to tell you how sick I was, tell you how sick I was.  And then I'm standing outside, and I got on my cell phone, and I called the guy.  I said, Larry, you won't believe this.  I'm standing outside the fucking Bellagio.  I can't move.  I got shit everywhere.  I shit all over myself.  And Larry's about a 48 waist. 
[03:14:30]  So he brings me over a pair of pants and some towels and some towels.  And so then he comes over, and he meets me.  I tell him where I'm standing.  He finds the closest bathroom.  When you go up the escalator, you go into the...  I can't get in the elevator.  It's 12 o'clock in the morning.  You know?  So he goes in.  He finds the closest bathroom in the lobby of the hotel.  And then I get in the escalator, and he kind of pretends like he dropped something  so no one gets behind me.  Tells me where it is.  I go in there.  He goes and gets the towel all wet for me. 
[03:15:00]  Throws it over the fucking stall.  I take off all my fucking clothes.  Just wipe off.  Leave my shoes.  Left my shoes, my pants, everything right there.  The towels right there in the stall.  And I'm walking barefoot with my shirt and his pants that are 48 ways through the lobby like this.  It's midnight.  Got up in the morning.  Took the most perfect double-tapered shit I've ever had in my life.  True story.  Who's the pitchers in this game?  And now, this is the Opie and Anthony show on the virus. 
[03:15:30]  Sirius XM.  Maybe you weren't even uncomfortable.  Have we all overreacted?  I mean, they said you're beautiful.  Jumping right into the interview with the hot piece-ass Mexican reporter.  I mean, you can kind of understand where they're coming from.  Ha ha.  So were you even remotely uncomfortable during any of this?  Yes, when I was uncomfortable is because I was in a locker room with men around, and I know that they are talking and joking about me.  And it's like a shy moment for me. 
[03:16:00]  It does not mean that I feel bad in the way that I feel that I have a sexual danger or something like this.  I never treat that.  I only say, it's an uncomfortable situation, but I need to keep in my focus on my job.  That's it.  I never say another thing.  Donkey show.  Donkey show.  A lot has been made about your behavior as far as dressing.  You call yourself one of the hottest sports reporters around.  Do you feel that you would dress appropriately? 
[03:16:30]  Well, actually, I think I dress properly for making my job because finally it's a pair of jeans.  I grew up watching Telemundo.  That's how they dress.  If I'm not attractive or not attractive to the players, that is not my fault.  And that's not the intention of my dress.  She's ridiculously hot.  I love that accent.  I have introduced a couple of stinkers on your nose straight out.  You can't imagine listening to that drivel, though.  Yes, I bet you she shits outside with that hiney. 
[03:17:00]  She could probably shit every mouth in the room with all that.  She's bilingual, man.  That's fucking amazing.  I can't do that.  You could handle a controversy in a second language.  When I talk about the Jews, what I was really trying to say, Anthony, when did your hatred begin?  I don't think it's hatred.  Uncomfortable moments are part of life.  I want to ask you that.  Also, the New York Post reports.  Go ahead.  I love his tie to get caught in the fucking wheel well of a plane that's taking him off. 
[03:17:30]  How could that happen?  He's jumping up and down.  Look at me.  I'm on TV.  Fucking tie flops up.  Look at her cleavage.  Is she even wearing a bra?  I know.  You would think she would button up today for all the interviews.  In this situation, I make my whole declaration of the fison, and that's it.  I'm in the middle of the controversy, but I never want to be there.  I hear you.  Inez, the bottom line is, do you want to be known for your body parts or your body of work? 
[03:18:00]  Look at the frumpy girl.  Give her a shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do you want to be known for your body parts or your body of work?  Because even today, you have worn a very low dress.  Well, I can tell you something.  Well, the fuck are you, you frumpy bitch?  You know that in television, the image counts.  My image is always the similar style, and my work and my image is together.  It's like you or any communicator in the world have an image to take care of. 
[03:18:30]  So I think it's my image and nothing more.  Thank you, Inez, and thank you for watching.  It's an exclusive, but make sure you get the weather.  Well, they cut that right off.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Oh, my God.  My image.  Shut up with your image.  What's an image?  My image with my cleavage.  Yeah, this girl.  She knows.  She's fucking ridiculously hot.  She's one of those girls, though, when you were on the phone, you'd forget why you liked her.  Oh, shit.  And then when you saw her, you were like, oh, yeah, that's right.  That's right. 
[03:19:00]  You got to listen to that fucking bullshit.  Anthony, it's Iman.  I talk about my image.  We go down to the pizza.  Shut up.  Oh, God.  Shut up.  Why are you being told me to me?  We need to talk.  And then, oh, wow.  Oh, yeah, you're right.  I was being mean to you.  Come on in.  I forgot about your image.  Set your purse down slowly.  She's so hot that she comes in the room.  Everybody probably is like, wait, there's a sunlamp over here now or something.  Bill, Oprah was giving away stuff yesterday. 
[03:19:30]  Her last year on TV before she starts her cable network.  And we got the audio.  She gave her her IUD and somebody's using her as a basket for a hot air balloon.  Oh, my God.  That's huge.  And smelly.  Who wants to fly around a 20-acre field and that smelly thing?  I'm a big fan of exaggeration humor.  Are you, Bill?  Yeah, I don't know what an IUD is.  I didn't get it.  Oh, it's something a girl puts in her pussy to keep from getting pregnant?  It's like a trampoline for the seeds. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, my God.  It kind of diverts the sperm.  Instead of the egg, they think they're in an amusement park.  They bounce around for a while.  They bounce and bounce until you stand up and they fall in your shoes.  That's the best way to get fucking not-a-chick pregnant.  Get a sperm magnet on your thighs.  Get not-a-chick pregnant.  I'm talking like that fucking lady, that reporter.  Signed you Tuesday.  I'm Polonia.  She's making everyone dumber. 
[03:20:30]  Her car should have exploded.  I know.  She should be driving the fucking-the jet's, like, medical car and around blows up.  Condi, Susie, Friday.  Got it.  Got it.  Oh, I love to suck her tits.  Angrily.  I'd make loud, big, adult baby noises.  It's kind of aggressive.  I'm laughing so hard today.  Big, suckable tits.  What were the sounds? 
[03:21:00]  I would sound like the eater of worlds.  You sound like conversation in the apartment next door.  Sound like the Peanuts teacher sucking her big, dumb tits.  Nice tits, idiot.  That's how she should be greeted whenever she walks into a room.  Holy shit.  Nice tits, stupid-o.  Nice tits, stupid-o.  Yeah, shut up and take them out.  Exactly.  Beat it.  How's your image now? 
[03:21:30]  In a room?  She's duct taped to a chair?  Holy shit.  That's when you know you're out of shape.  When you actually, like, moan when you eat.  Oh.  Damn.  Fuck.  All right, why don't we tell you.  You left my ass off.  The Oprah audio is classic.  All righty.  She has to give away something every year, I guess, right?  Yep.  I never heard of that.  So here's the big giveaway for this.  That's what she does.  Final season of the Oprah show. 
[03:22:00]  And I don't really have any business in Philadelphia or New York or L.A.  And then I thought, gee, maybe I ought to think bigger.  Oh, bigger.  In person.  Bigger than what?  Bigger.  You now?  She's talking about her pants.  Yeah, exactly.  She tries to buy a 75X.  Is that a size?  It would be really bad.  She had to wear the flag off the Verrazano Bridge. 
[03:22:30]  Get it?  Fatso.  Get a little fatso.  Hey, get a little fatso over there.  And, of course, you wouldn't have business in New York, like coming to the serious studios  and doing a show from her to her studio.  I want the opportunity not to be able to look at her again.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Oprah came by once, and we weren't allowed to look at her.  Maybe she would have business in Philadelphia.  Maybe Michael Vick could drown her.  Because of the stuff you say on the show or just because of? 
[03:23:00]  No, everybody here.  You're not allowed to look at her?  I would understand if they wanted to keep us away from her.  They put all kinds of barriers up so you couldn't see her doing the show.  Even though we all work for this fine company.  They make these studios of glass so you could see inside all the studios, and then she's  doing something.  They set up barriers.  Apparently she's shooting caviar party for Germany.  Because she's Oprah, and God forbid anyone looks at her.  You can't look at her.  I don't know what happens.  I wanted to throw a cum rubber at her.  They don't want to wreck that amazing deal they made with her, where she doesn't promote 
[03:23:30]  SiriusXM on her hugely popular TV show.  They don't want to wreck that deal.  Oh, my God.  Free stuff.  What do they swing?  Exactly.  She's giving out seats with fists so into them.  It sounds like she's broken one of the chains.  Because after all, this really is my 25th season. 
[03:24:00]  And this is really my last chance to do something really big.  And if you want to do something big, you would want to take along your ultimate deal.  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  So I started to think about, where would I most want to go? 
[03:24:30]  Where would she most want to go?  Oh, that's an island?  Yeah, they should show a picture of a gym with a big X to it.  A big red X to it.  A fucking treadmill.  A big circle and an X.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, man.  So what does she give him? 
[03:25:00]  Well, a new Ford Focus.  She's done that already.  Yeah, it's old school.  She's an old hat, Bill.  It's as big as your imagination.  Oprah's got a big imagination, Bill.  Yeah, she certainly does.  Keeps it in her ass.  Maybe I should take all of you with me to...  You know what?  I would be content.  I would totally be content to move on. 
[03:25:30]  What?  Red Lobster.  Red Lobster.  All right, we could play one of our favorite games here.  Hold on, man.  Let me go back.  Oh, shit.  All of you with me to...  Improv school.  Jesus.  We suck.  No, I just would get in trouble for anything I say. 
[03:26:00]  Oh, I know.  I have so many answers.  You're showing restraint.  A little bit.  It's just going to be some stupid cruise.  Yeah.  Where she'll pretend she's on the boat and they'll helicopter her away during the night.  Of course they will.  Like Omar Suarez.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  The helicopter just crashes.  I know.  Or it just takes off and the two things that she's attached to just stay on the fucking boat.  It's just rotor blades and a guy in a chair.  Where's that so? 
[03:26:30]  Operation Dumbo Drop.  Get him off the boat like Klinghofer.  Put her in a chair.  Harpooner.  Fucking Greenpeace will fight to get her off the boat.  She's fat.  Oh, shit.  You with me to...  No, I'm not saying that. 
[03:27:00]  I'm not saying that.  I'm not saying that.  Oh, fuck.  Real answer time.  Real answer time.  All of you with me to the other side of the world.  That's right.  Indian Ocean.  We are.  We are.  We are.  Oh. 
[03:27:30]  We are.  And that music is actually just her jumping up and down.  We are.  We are.  We are.  We are going.  We are.  We are.  And she was pointed to the...  And you.  And you.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  And you.  And you.  That'd be great if there was one retarded person.  She said, and not you.  And you.  Everyone but you.  So she's taking the entire audience.  To Australia.  To Australia.  Yep. 
[03:28:00]  And by the way, as she's saying this...  Do you know how they're going yet?  This gets even better.  Hopefully by noose.  Just a fucking audience full of hens being dragged by their throats through the ocean.  Like fucking chum.  I hope on Oceanic 815.  Dude.  Exactly.  Hopefully Mohamed Atta's got a hat on.  Even.  Even better than any joke you can make.  Part two of the bit's about to start.  Yeah.  You haven't heard yet?  No.  We are going to Australia! 
[03:28:30]  We are going to Australia!  Oh, they've got it.  They're going to Australia.  To the pilot!  To the what?  The pilot.  Do you know what's happening right now?  A Qantas Airlines plane is coming through the fucking...  Studio.  Studio.  Yeah.  And guess which pilot beard gets off the fucking plane?  Oh, no.  Don't say it.  Part two of the bit's about to begin.  He's back! 
[03:29:00]  John Travolta?  How funny is that?  There you go.  Let's say hello again to Captain Travolta!  Travolta is going to fly these fucking dummies to Australia.  And he was going to tip his hat, but his wig was attached to it.  So he couldn't.  Oh, no.  Look, she knows how to pull off a promotion, though.  Jesus.  I think Emo probably is in charge of this one.  And we get a big plane to come through. 
[03:29:30]  The trip has been organized.  Where do we get a fuselage?  I need a fuselage.  Wow.  What a guy.  And she's going to be shooting at the Sydney Opera House.  Really?  Yep.  So Elo gets to go to fucking Sydney, Australia?  I hope they make him stay here.  Look at these hens just all...  Oh, God.  Look at this sweet potato getting off.  Captain Travolta.  Captain Travolta is like one of the village people.  Important for duty.  He's all dressed in his pilot uniform.  That's great.  I don't understand, like, people losing their shit to that... 
[03:30:00]  Like, what you'd have to say to me to get that expression on my fucking face.  Yeah, they're freaking the fuck out.  They're crying.  They're going all straight with Oprah and John Travolta.  Maybe all of you don't know this, but John Travolta is actually a real Qantas Airlines pilot.  He's not flying enough.  Who's flown there many times, and we have been secretly plotting, planning this trip of a lifetime  for almost a year with everyone at Tourism Australia. 
[03:30:30]  And they are ready to roll out the red carpet for all 300 of us!  What a dumb voice.  Is that the Jodie Foster going under that thing?  How great would it be if the plane crashes, they're on a deserted island,  and now Oprah has to eat her audience to survive?  That's what I want to say.  Oh, my God.  I'm actually buying geese and bringing them to Chicago.  How great would it be if a bunch of geese fucking brought that flight to a halt? 
[03:31:00]  You don't think you get to hang out with Oprah, though, right?  You'd probably see her on the trip.  You think she's flying with Travolta?  You see her as she's going on her private plane.  Of course she is.  I'll meet you there, trash.  I'll go there.  She sits on one side.  Everyone else sits on the other.  Even the plane out, because, you know, she's fat.  I know Gayle King is going, and a couple of other friends. 
[03:31:30]  Why is she going?  Other friends?  What's going on there?  Yeah, yeah, sure.  What about John Travolta, who's going to be a co-pilot with him?  With his little friend that he was kissing on the steps of the plane that day?  Oh, Mr. Smooch?  I don't know.  You've seen that picture, right, Bill?  No.  I'm completely out of the loop with this.  Danny, can you bring up that picture of...  There'd be a lot of that going on in the cockpit.  There it is.  Look at that picture there, huh? 
[03:32:00]  Ooh, hi.  Who's this friend that he's got?  With his big bald head?  That picture...  Fucking boyfriend?  Stepping off a plane?  He's bald and fat and kissing a man, and everybody just forgot.  I think he's people like Travolta, maybe.  I don't know.  What do you think that's about?  What do I think that's about?  Two men who are happy to see each other.  Yeah, it's Europe.  We're going to see Bill in a while.  We're not giving him a kiss on the lips.  No, it's true.  We shook hands. 
[03:32:30]  You guys have always been cold to me.  Is that it?  You want us to make out?  Peck on the cheek.  Feel Anthony's mustache against my ear.  Ah, yes.  Jesus.  Seriously thinking of shaving.  Like, just completely.  Everything.  Yeah, I'm getting really fucking bored.  But I'm totally going with the Hitler for like a day.  Just to go.  But you have that little...  Jordan has a Hitler.  You have that little Latino mustache, though.  Yeah, I've been chopping it down as time went on. 
[03:33:00]  Because, you know...  Right.  I chop it down a little bit, make it thinner.  And now I'm just tired of the whole fucking thing.  You're starting to look like a silent film star.  Yeah.  I know.  That's a fucking...  The makeup woman there at Red Eye said that.  She goes,  My God, you look like Douglas Fairbanks.  Oh.  Like Douglas Fairbanks.  Now we know why you want to shave everything.  I look like Douglas Fairbanks.  It's the Opie and Harry Reams show.  Harry Reams.  Oh, my God.  Well, Harry Reams had the big...  Well, I look as drunk as Douglas Fairbanks. 
[03:33:30]  Exactly.  Have you ever like...  Oh, you kind of look like him.  Douglas Fairbanks.  That's weird.  Do you watch one of those...  Any of those Turner broadcast...  Like the movie classics?  Yeah.  And I always like...  I don't know.  I'm obsessed with like death.  So I always got to see like...  How long did that guy live before he died?  The amount of fucking people...  Especially the starlets who...  Accidentally killed themselves with barbiturates and alcohol.  Oh, yeah.  Because nobody knew shit back then.  You'd be like...  You got nervous energy.  Here, take a couple of these.  And everybody was boozing. 
[03:34:00]  Everybody had their own little martini kit...  Everywhere they fucking went.  Where's Mary Pickford, America's sweetheart?  Here, she's having hysterics.  She's having...  Exactly.  Give her these tranquilizers and barbiturates.  Well, the first thing you'd do...  You'd shake them by their shoulders...  And then slap them a couple of times.  Get a hold of yourself.  Didn't work.  Get a hold of yourself.  That was actually prescribed.  Yeah, page one of the medical book.  Let's get a hold of yourself.  Slap her.  Get a hold of yourself.  Get a hold of yourself.  Three refills. 
[03:34:30]  Tummies back then.  Put a stake on your eye.  Don't.  And take a Coke bottle from Fatty Arbuckle.  I love him.  He fucking malleted a Coke bottle into a vagina.  Never happened.  He tried to do a stand-up gig.  I know.  I heard it never happened.  I heard it never happened.  I hope it did.  Makes me thirsty.  I don't care.  I say it did.  We'll lose 20% of our show if it never happened.  No, I'm sorry.  Yeah, please.  Out of your buckle.  Jim Bliss, it makes me thirsty.  Put up...  Let me see Mary Pickford.  America's sweetheart, Mary Pickford.  How bad her twat must have smelled. 
[03:35:00]  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Look at that, huh?  Yeah.  She's creepy.  Her hair looks terrible.  She's so creepy.  Well, they didn't have, like, fucking...  They didn't have Pantene back then.  I know.  What did you wash with the...  Like, lye soap in your hair.  Oh, okay.  And your box.  Oh.  God, that...  You just washed your hair with soap?  Wonderful.  Yeah, what did you wash your hair with back then?  Yeah, soap.  They didn't have fucking shampoo.  It was soap. 
[03:35:30]  And that's when they did fucking bathe.  It was, like, once a week.  The people were filthy.  Fucking animals.  Yeah, did they take a shit on the beach and throw it in the ocean?  Who did that?  Put up Fay Wray.  Let me see a good Fay Wray picture, too.  See what she looked like.  That was oldie time...  What the fuck?  That's not...  There's no Fay Wray pictures there.  I think that's spelled wrong.  How about Jane Mansfield?  Oh, boy.  That's not too old.  Fay Wray. 
[03:36:00]  Well, that's a good shot of her.  Is she going to Australia?  All right.  You know...  I'm just saying.  I'm just looking.  Look at her.  Let me see.  She was real good at going...  Oh, is that Fay Wray?  With her gams.  She had nice legs.  Nice fat.  She had, like, fat 1920s legs.  Yeah, they all had those fucking...  They all looked like Miss Crabtree from The Little Rascals.  Didn't they?  Yeah, of course.  Look at that.  Oldie time.  Look at her.  She looks like...  What's Meryl Streep?  She wants to do some banging. 
[03:36:30]  Who is that?  Fay Wray.  Wow.  And you know they were just all hairy as a fuck.  Everything.  They're all get-up?  Just fucking...  Fucking pussies look like Star Wars creatures.  Hey, shrub cunt.  Come here.  I want to talk to you.  Hairy as your imagination.  All right.  Hey, you almost got a nip shot there.  I think you do.  And those big fucking, like, Superman underwear panties she's wearing. 
[03:37:00]  You can kind of see them through there.  She looks like George Reeves.  Disaster.  Oh, God.  How'd you fuck back there?  Is that her?  Hey, Anthony, when you were a teen, you used to go down to the Nickelodeon.  Yes, yes.  I'd go down to the Nickelodeon.  Drop a nickel in.  During Prohibition.  Yes.  We'd go to the speakeasies.  Give a coded knock so I could get in.  That's Fay Wray.  Well, not now.  She's dead.  Oh, she's dead. 
[03:37:30]  They wanted her to do the line,  Twas Beauty that killed the beast at the end of the new Kong,  but she died,  which is why Jack Black fucking did it with the emotional enthusiasm of effects.  It was terrible, his performance.  Twas Beauty that killed the beast.  Ooh, yuck.  That remake was disappointing.  The graphics were good.  You're not a fan of Jack Black.  I don't like Jack Black.  Why?  No, CGI is killed movies.  Yeah, you're not a big fan. 
[03:38:00]  If you watch the old movies, the stunts, when there's an actual guy risking his life.  Jumping a car and, you know, the old cow's need-em movies.  It's easy.  Where the stuntmen were.  You totally had me.  I was like, all right, he knows.  They didn't go as fast as today.  All the stuntmen were all relatives, too.  All related to each other back then.  Like there was a father, grandfather, a son working on one Hal Needham movie with Burt Reynolds. 
[03:38:30]  I shot something one day, and this older dude on the shoot was saying how he used to work on The Fall Guy.  And he goes, we would, like, wreck, like, 17 cars an episode.  He goes, we would just have them all lined up.  These old Monte Carlos and Cutlasses.  I can't afford that.  That might be fun.  Because it was, like, three networks, and you got, like, a 30 share.  Right.  Why the fuck?  I'm talking like an idiot, of course.  Someone wants us to, well, it's Matt in Connecticut.  Google Miss America from 1935. 
[03:39:00]  Ah, let's see what she looks like.  I don't know why 1935.  Yes.  Here she is.  Straight from the beaches of Atlantic City.  There she is with her crown.  Henrietta, her name was.  At least she had a sexy name.  Henrietta.  You know something?  What are you going to do?  That wasn't bad looking for her one piece fucking shitty bathing suit.  She had big natural boobs.  Yeah, she did.  She got that, uh... 
[03:39:30]  You know something?  That ain't bad.  You would do that.  Right on the boardwalk.  Yes.  Wonderful.  What an unsexy bathing suit she's wearing.  What do you think?  I kind of like it.  It's like Jack O'Lane's leotard.  What do you think the bush looked like?  Oh, that thing is fucking...  All the way to the back?  Oh, yeah.  Front to back.  I like that bathing suit.  Oh, yeah.  Right up to the small of her back.  Oh, forget about it.  It's like she stapled a muskrat to her tailbone and belly button.  Was that the worst you ever done? 
[03:40:00]  You're going on a date and the girl kind of has a half shirt and you just catch above  her ass those fucking hairs.  And you're like, oh, God.  Pretty dark.  Yeah.  We're going into the bush tonight.  This is going to be...  Yeah.  This is going to be thick.  This is going to be thick.  Thick as thieves.  Come over here, porcupine.  That's her?  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Well, she's smiling.  Yeah.  The teeth are awful.  There's a little problem back then.  Nice gams. 
[03:40:30]  She's Miss America, 1939.  Jesus Christ.  Look how much fucking...  Because there's so few people, the level of raw materials you could use for a fucking  trophy back then.  Look at that.  That's the same amount of metal they're using like a fucking skyscraper now.  Yeah, you're right.  There's no one there.  Yeah, look at the emptiness behind her, too.  Oh, yeah.  It's ridiculous.  It goes to show you, there wasn't many people around back then.  Yeah.  It's great.  College zone.  That's what I...  I look at old pictures of fucking L.A. and it's just like you could just... 
[03:41:00]  Oh, flat orange groves.  Yeah, Orange County was all orange trees.  Orange groves with fucking like dirt roads through them.  Dude, and I'll tell you that, that real housewives of the fucking Orange County, that I thought  that they grabbed the six mutant freaks from down there.  I did a show down there.  That is really what...  Yeah.  Like plastic surgery is out of control there.  Yeah, yeah.  Like every like fifth dude has that Bruce Jenner facelift that you look sort of like half  Asian now.  Why would anyone do that?  And the fucking...  Those goddamn duck bill lips. 
[03:41:30]  If a woman thinks shooting that collagen shit in her lips is making her look good, her  friends probably go like, oh, they look so full and nice.  And not one guy is looking at that thinking, wow, she looks sexy.  I think the problem is I think it looks good the first time you do it.  They just don't know when to stop.  No, I don't think it looks good then either.  Oh my God.  Oh, that is horrific.  Who is that?  Those look like Mr. Potato Head lips.  And she just is biting down on that thing. 
[03:42:00]  Oh, shit.  Duck lips.  Did you guys see that video?  Duck face on YouTube?  No.  What is it?  Uh, they're just making fun of how all the girls do the stupid...  I've seen that side.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They do the mmm, mmm, the purse, the lips, and do a little peace sign.  The pouty face.  Pouty face girl.  Yeah, it's like it's a fucking, uh...  They do that on a little Miss Perfect.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  This is not going to be funny to your listeners because they've got to see the faces.  That's a nice montage. 
[03:42:30]  They are all doing the...  What is that?  Girls, don't do that.  Stop doing that.  Don't do that at all, ever.  Duck face.  Duck face.  Duck face.  Duck face.  Why are you making that stupid?  Duck face.  Duck face.  That's auto sound.  Duck face.  Duck face.  That's a horrific girl.  I don't know how this got started, but all you dumb bitches look fucking retarded. 
[03:43:00]  It's not even the worst.  It's fucking horrible.  So take your lips and put them back to no more.  Duck face.  Duck face.  Duck face.  Duck face.  Why are you making that stupid?  Duck face.  Duck face.  Duck face.  Duck face.  Why are you making that stupid?  Duck face.  Oh.  It's true.  Why are they doing that?  Duck face.  I can't remember the lyrics to this song, though. 
[03:43:30]  You're forgetting them.  Duck face.  God, it's just me.  They're all doing the...  Purse their lips.  What the fuck is that?  You pucker up your lips.  Stop doing that.  Duck face.  All right.  Fucking retards.  Yeah, and then you've got to do the peace.  Yeah, the peace.  I'm making a duck face and a peace sign, motherfucker.  I don't know.  We did sports.  I think we're almost at the end here.  Goddamn, Jimmy.  How about the way you Jets the final play, man?  I mean, what the...  All right, Bill. 
[03:44:00]  Bill, you'd take it in salt and put it in his wounds.  We play your pats this weekend, though.  Yeah, and that's one of those games.  It's like divisional rivalry games.  It doesn't mean anything, because basically you can go one way or the other.  That's why the Jets.  I don't get it.  The fucking Dolphins could beat that team.  On any given Sunday.  Any given Sunday.  Any given Sunday.  What other sports cliche could I use?  Yeah.  Any given Sunday, the good one.  I'll tell you, when you're not firing on all cylinders...  I was in that movie.  You've got to have your game face on.  You've got to have your game face.  You've got to be ready to go out there and play for 60 minutes. 
[03:44:30]  Strap it on.  110 percent.  Leave it all on the field.  That's right.  Give it 110 percent.  Just play your game.  Yeah.  You know, we're not satisfied with where we're at.  We didn't just, you know, just want to make the playoffs.  Team came to play.  We knew they were going to be a tough team, and they were.  They played.  We just didn't get it done.  We didn't get it done today.  And I blame myself.  I take full responsibility.  Didn't get it done today.  I take full responsibility for this loss.  I hate that full responsibility shit. 
[03:45:00]  What does that mean in the end?  It means nothing.  Nothing.  Yeah.  Obama says that a lot.  I'm disappointed.  Obama takes full responsibility.  Yeah.  For what?  It's a way of challenging people to keep boggling.  It's almost like saying, okay, now you can't beat up on me anymore because I'm taking, I  take full responsibility.  That's true.  And then if you continue challenging the person, you look like the asshole.  But that means, that should mean we could tase you or something.  Oh, sure.  That Raven Simone chick that used to be on Cosby or something.  She has giant tits. 
[03:45:30]  A giant rear.  Yeah.  She's a big girl.  Big curvaceous girl and shit.  She, what about the other one?  Wendy?  Rudy.  Rudy ended up being, I think, all right, right?  I remember.  Ray Dawn Chong was fuckable.  Yeah.  Back then.  Was she in that or no?  Raven.  No.  No, I'm sorry.  Who am I thinking of?  Rudy.  No, no, no.  From the Mickey Rourke movie.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, fuck.  What's her name?  Oh, shit.  Nine and a half weeks.  Yeah.  She was married to Lenny Kravitz for a while. 
[03:46:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, but what does play like a jet?  Oh, Lisa.  Wendy Joss Berber.  Oh, no.  Lisa Bonet is the real answer, right?  Well, Lisa Bonet.  Is she?  Yeah.  The Jets, what?  What does play like a jet mean?  I don't know.  Play like a jet?  If you haven't won it since 1969, wouldn't you want to play like a cowboy or a patriot?  That's a great point.  Or anything else.  Play like a jet.  Get them all excited during the regular season and then shit the bed.  New York sports teams aren't that good. 
[03:46:30]  They all ride the coattails of the New York Yankees.  They draft behind them.  The Yankees do very well, obviously, but...  The most successful franchise of all time.  Undisputable.  You think so?  Yeah, probably right.  Without a doubt, yeah.  They got more than the Canadians.  Lost one in...  But after that, it falls off.  It drops off really bad.  Considering you guys have doubled down in almost every sport.  Rangers?  After the Yankees?  As far as winning a title?  As far as...  No, Giants.  Oh, Giants.  Giants got three.  Duh. 
[03:47:00]  The Knicks haven't won since, what, 73?  73, yeah.  My God, really?  The Rangers have won one cup since 1940.  But the fucking Yankees, they've won like a third of all World Series.  It's insane.  Yeah, but they've lost two thirds.  Oh, my fault.  Oh, Spock.  My fault.  All right, Bill, why don't we give the big plug out there?  Yes!  All right, let's do it.  Bill Burr, let it go.  His second Comedy Central special this Sunday at 11 p.m.  And then it's available on DVD, but don't worry about that. 
[03:47:30]  Watch it live.  Yeah, and get the DVD.  This Sunday at 11.  You can actually pre-order it for a disgustingly low amount of money on Amazon.com.  Oh, really?  $13.26.  Wow.  You can pre-order it.  Yeah, exactly.  Nice.  That is ridiculous.  A DVD is a great gift for someone you don't give a shit about, but you're obligated to  give them something.  Like, here you go, stupid.  Here you go, stupid.  Laugh it up, fuck face.  This is how you tell them to have fun without you.  Wait, and you got a new show coming out? 
[03:48:00]  Did we know this?  No, I shot a pilot.  I shot a pilot, so we got to see if it gets picked up.  Okay.  You people are all the same?  Is the name of the show?  Oh, no, no.  That was my stand-up.  When I went to Montreal, they were like, you know, you have to name your show.  And I was like, well, how about Bill Burr does stand-up?  You're like, no, name it.  I would have called it Bill Burr is everybody.  And that's actually a quote from a story somebody told me, a Burt Reynolds story, where they  went in to pitch this show. 
[03:48:30]  It was actually a great idea.  And they go in and they pitch this show.  And the fucking idea is killing.  And everybody's liking it.  And Burt's actually coming around like, okay, maybe this is going to go good.  And then, like, right in the end, like, the industry, like, the typical industry goes,  we love everything.  Now, but what if Burt's character was like a plumber?  And there was this awkward silence.  And then Burt just looked at him and went, you fucking people are all the same.  And then the writer had to be like, well, what Burt is trying to say?  And then had to try to save it.  And he went outside and just punched Sally Field right in the face. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah.  I call her a cunt.  And he fucking won the set of WKRP in Cincinnati and gave Lonnie Anderson a cunt kick just  for good measure.  Even though he wasn't dating her yet.  But he knew he would be.  Of course he was.  Right.  Fucking grabbed his fucking wig off the hat rack and said, good day.  Good day, sir.  He actually beat Lonnie's vagina with one of Herb Tarlick's white shoes.  Threw a frozen turkey at her.  Do you know they actually brought that show back? 
[03:49:30]  Yeah?  They brought it back and they did the new WKRP and that bombed.  And even though that show made it to syndication, they never really played in syndication because  the amount of money it costs because they played actual songs to get the music rights.  So they all got fucked.  Oh, that sucks.  Who's living in L.A.?  Who's got a couple of inside stories?  A little behind the scenes here.  I like it.  Who was in the new one?  Who told you that?  Were you in a hot tub with Howard Hesman?  Yeah. 
[03:50:00]  Hey, Jimmy, you do what you got to do out there.  No, actually, the WKRP, somebody else told me that one, but the new WKRP was just a lonely  moment on the road.  And I was like, is Les Nesman still alive?  Wait, what the fuck is that?  Because there are a couple of people that are from the original.  Gordon Jump came back.  The dude who played Les Nesman came back.  And the guy who played Herb Tarlick came back.  Did Dudley grow up and get molested in this one, too, by Gordon Jump on the desk? 
[03:50:30]  Yes, look at him.  Look at all the nobodies that never did anything after this.  Can we see the cast?  You don't know any of those people.  They have a buxom redhead instead of the buxom blonde.  Is there any clips of this on YouTube?  I'd love to hear one clip.  Oh, I bet it's abominable.  What was the song?  Why remake it?  No, I'll tell you the bad ones are the ones that McLean Stevenson did after he left MASH.  There's one even worse.  He just did the McLean Stevenson show.  After that, 10th.  Yes, the McLean Stevenson show.  And it was... 
[03:51:00]  All right, here we go.  That's a new W. Caribbean Cincinnati episode, too.  Where are we going with Johnny Fever, okay?  Calls and a letter from the Ohio Dairymen's Association.  Ooh.  That must be an invitation to their Just Say Moo ball.  Where they get out the Golden Guernsey Awards for outstanding bovine journalism?  I've never won one of those.  Well, I hope it happens before Mrs. Carlson sells the station.  How did you know about the sale of the station? 
[03:51:30]  I'm the receptionist.  I listen in on all the phone calls.  Wow.  Hey, good morning, Ronnie.  Morning, Mr. Atta.  Here's the new Venus flytrap.  I'm sorry you went through all the trouble of moving to Cincinnati and now all this confusion.  Well, that's okay.  This is America.  I can live anywhere.  Would you mind watching the phone for a minute?  Then I've got to run this back to traffic.  Not next to me.  I don't know.  You've got to run this back to traffic.  Just take a minute.  It's a phone, idiot.  This is the awful pilot episode where everybody, all the dialogue has to be explaining the  characters.  Right, right, right.  Must be rough having moved here all the way from Iowa now that you're in Cincinnati, Mr. 
[03:52:00]  Fish out of water.  Not as bad as me, considering I just got out of a relationship and now live in an attic above  these people.  And then the crazy character does something zany to get you out of the scene.  Oh, Lonnie Anderson came back.  Oh, Lonnie Anderson makes a cameo.  I must.  Shouldn't you answer the phone?  Uh, uh, uh, W-K-R-P. 
[03:52:30]  They're using, uh, real songs on this, too.  Wondered.  I can't believe it.  Wondered.  Whatever became of me.  Living on the air in the air in the air.  Of Cincinnati.  Living there.  Fighting HIV.  Packin'.  Frank Bonner.  Frank Bonner.  AZT.  Taking it twice a day.  Maybe I'll never see the end of the 90s. 
[03:53:00]  Maybe Burt will blacken her eye once in a while.  Oh, that was Tawny Katane in that?  I was going to ask.  Yeah.  That looked like her in that shot.  Before she, uh, before she, uh, went on the crack.  What year was this?  Early 90s.  Oh, was it really?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  This just looks terrible.  They look the same, though.  Gordon Jump looks...  What does, uh, Herb Tarlick look like? 
[03:53:30]  He looks exactly the same.  Yeah, but he just looked old anyway.  I guess caressing fucking Gary Coleman and young Dudley really fucking kept him young.  Young Dudley's Hershey Kiss nipples.  What, he played a molester in an episode?  In different strokes.  Oh, yes.  Jesus.  That really just took...  Very famous episode.  Gave a whole new name to that meeting, uh, that show that I can't really say.  What the fuck happened there?  Whole new meaning to different strokes.  Right.  That was the laugh I was going for.  That would have been the joke. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah, boy.  Yeah.  He got them in a bathtub and showed them dirty cartoons.  Yeah, dirty, uh, cartoons.  Want to take some pictures, I think.  Mr. Drummond cock-blocked.  Like, he doesn't understand.  Get Willis and Arnold half-naked in the house.  Yeah, they don't believe the kids, of course.  That was really forward-thinking of theirs, because, you know, making it an older white  man, because then the Chris Hansen, we really, uh, there was a lot of white dudes on there.  Yeah, they really...  Oh, that's a...  A lot of Indian dudes, too.  White crime...  Yeah, and, uh, Indian guys.  Who were into kids and real estate. 
[03:54:30]  Yeah.  I thought the house was for sale.  I just want to...  And, and, and, apparently the Opie and Anthony show, one of them.  All right, well, yeah.  This was one of the famous clips on that.  Oh, yeah.  They caught an ONA.  Oh, that was fantastic.  The guy's just sitting there, and Chris Hansen comes out and he goes, uh...  We got that clip.  If Bill's never heard, it's so worth playing.  Yeah, where is that one?  It's on YouTube, too, by the way.  It's everywhere.  Just put ONA fan, Predator show.  This isn't one of our prouder moments, Bill Burr.  Of course it is.  Yeah.  I wouldn't be happier if fucking John Wayne Gacy painted this show a clown picture. 
[03:55:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Why?  He was a good painter.  He was a good...  It's like Bob Vila, but he fucked children.  We got it.  Oh, you got it over here?  Dude, you're fucking on fire today.  They're really good.  I had them before.  Yeah.  Did you bring the smoke?  Cocktease.  Can I just roll it up wherever?  This guy's great.  Wouldn't you just see this guy at every appearance we've done?  He wants the decoy to smell the marijuana he brought. 
[03:55:30]  Boy, are you in trouble.  Oh, God.  Smells good.  Smells good.  I'm just going to go get something and drink.  No!  No, you're not!  Fuck!  It seems something about that line gets this man thinking.  Perhaps he's heard it before.  I want you to just keep your hands right where I can see them, okay?  And I want you to sit right there.  Oh, my God.  No, keep your hands right where I can see them.  He's like Abe Lincoln Beer.  Yeah.  What is this right here?  Some pot.  Some pot. 
[03:56:00]  And what was your plan tonight?  Trying to come down, you know, talk to her.  Talk to her?  Yeah, just talk to her.  You're Chris Samson?  I am.  Have you seen this show?  You have, too?  I thought you were real funny on Opinion Athlete.  Oh, you listened to me on Opinion Athlete?  Can I honestly tell you something?  Yeah, too.  I want to say in the back of my mind that I...  It's a proud moment for us right there.  Oh, the pills is shot!  I mean, you're watching a guy... 
[03:56:30]  Like, the thing about this...  Like, this show is so fucked up where you almost feel for the molester.  You're like...  You're just like...  You're just looking at the dude going like,  this guy is going to jail and he is going to be fucking...  His whole life is fucked.  Oh, my God.  They're going to be scrubbing their assholes with his fucking beard.  Clean it up before you lick it, damn fucking cutie pie.  What happens to these guys, though?  What do you think?  But how long did they go away for?  A lot of them just got probation. 
[03:57:00]  A little probation.  Oh, get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, yeah.  Some of the other guys, though, that had priors, they went away.  But a lot of these guys first time, they got probation.  They should shoot you.  But they're put on the sexual predator list and all that bullshit.  Oh, fuck that.  Until they do it again, they should fucking...  You're telling me?  I'm not making a loss here, Bill.  You're fighting it.  They should fucking...  Two in the back of the head.  Two in the back of the head.  Two in the back of the head.  Yeah.  Chris Hanson, if that's the way the show should go down.  He should let two in the back of the head have a 14-year-old.  Yes, I am. 
[03:57:30]  Chris Hanson executioner.  It's probation and a lot of awkward Thanksgivings, though.  Right.  That's the big problem.  Oh, a lot of destroyed marriages.  Your family and friends are all like, oh, fuck.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Yeah, but what I'm saying is the dude is still out there.  And he can only fucking...  I talked to a real funny on Opie and Anthony.  He can only rub on...  That's the worst.  Yeah, it was awful.  It was great.  I just came here for some young pussy.  Suffering suck-atash. 
[03:58:00]  Please, can we hear him?  Frunkus.  Yeah, listen to us.  Frunkus.  Yeah, Uncle Paul.  Look, I'm a real-life Uncle Paul.  You knew what?  I knew I was going to be running into you.  I think it was the first time we've had rounds.  I'm kind of chuckling about it just because, you know...  What is he, got peanut butter?  I don't know.  Do you think it's funny?  He fucking carries thumbtacks on his tongue.  It's funny how dumb I'm really turning into.  This girl you were chatting with online.  Yeah.  He's how old?  37. 
[03:58:30]  She said 14.  14.  Yeah.  And you are how old?  I am 25.  That's right in the demo, though.  That should be good for us.  Yeah, come on.  It's not that bad, right?  The 1800s.  That was a love story.  Yeah, Little House on the Prairie.  That fucking was exactly what happened.  Right.  He had like five kids by the time they were 19, still had a flat stomach throughout their  churning butter.  You think he had a bad lisp?  Oh, that was terrible.  Holy shit.  He sounded like Chris Hansen.  How did shit happen to me? 
[03:59:00]  Someone's saying charges drop because of entrapment.  No, it's not entrapment.  All right.  I'm just saying what definitely not.  Some idiot saying.  He's lying.  This is a guy who's forced to go back to Pennsylvania Dutch country, build a wall.  Don't be Amish face.  Well, I'm out of here.  Exit.  States left keeping.  Oh, all right.  To answer everybody's questions, Marco Island, because everybody's been asking me about that.  Oh, right.  Yeah.
