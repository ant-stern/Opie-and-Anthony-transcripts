<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts self-deprecatingly mocking their show's lack of success, segueing into a discussion about the Empire State Building's lighting choices (or lack thereof) on Mother Teresa's birthday, sparking cynical commentary on religion and poverty.  They then criticized a new NYC building's design, comparing it to a middle finger, further discussing the evolving skyline and referencing 9/11.  Anthony voiced concerns about upcoming tropical storms impacting his vacation, leading to crude jokes about road trips with children. The conversation abruptly shifted to the Cake Boss TV show, prompted by caller E-Rock's complaint about a ridiculously expensive, yet underwhelming, cake from Carlo's Bakery.  Several subsequent callers echoed similar experiences with overpriced and disappointing cakes from the same bakery, detailing long wait times and exorbitant deposits. One listener even recounted a Cake Boss episode focused on the bakers' golfing ineptitude.

The conversation took a shocking turn with the revelation of Remy Gonzalez's arrest for sexually assaulting a teenager. Opie and Anthony criticized a local news station for their poor reporting, focusing on a different Cake Boss employee instead. Listener calls continued to detail bizarre cake designs and opinions on the show.  Finally, the segment concluded with a discussion of Scott Weiland's stage fall, with the hosts expressing their dislike for the musician and listeners sharing their own negative experiences with him. The hosts also speculated about Tiger Woods' improved golf game post-divorce, making crude jokes about HGH use and his relationships with Waffle House waitresses.  Throughout this segment, profanity and crude, sexually suggestive remarks were prevalent.

The next segment began with a discussion of upcoming UFC fights and reminiscing about previous encounters with fighters Randy Couture and BJ Penn, including popular video clips. The show then introduced their guests: Rich Voss (whose new teeth were a major topic, including detailed descriptions of his dental work), Bob Kelly, Oscar (on his last day), and Ira.  A game of "$25,000 Pyramid" was planned.  A significant portion focused on Rich Voss's dental procedure, his pain management, and comparison to Ron from the Ron & Fez show's appendectomy experience.  This led to discussions about addiction and gambling, with Voss detailing his past gambling problems and specific number combinations he played.  Other topics included STP, a joke about airplane finds,  allegations of plagiarism against radio duo Lamont and Tinelli, Andy Kimmel's stand-up, Tiger Woods' media coverage, and a lengthy discussion about Oscar's upcoming trip to Columbia, including a discussion of cocaine availability and price there.  The segment ended with Oscar's departure and preparations for the "Pyramid" game, with continuous vulgar language throughout.

The following segment featured caller Oscar recounting anecdotes about his friend's sexual exploits with transvestites and drug use, including what was possibly amyl nitrate.  The conversation frequently revolved around graphic sexual acts.  In-studio guests Bob Kelly and Rich Voss participated in a game of "Pyramid." Discussions included Rich Voss's upcoming stand-up gigs, Jim Norton's shows, and Bob Kelly's appearances.  Bobo brought gifts for Anthony, including antique poker chips (smelling of fire), an Ozzy Osbourne lunchbox, and a Mets bib.  A significant portion focused on the pungent odor emanating from Rich Voss's ear infection or cyst, eliciting disgusted reactions from the guests.

The subsequent segment featured a chaotic game of "Pyramid" with Opie, Anthony, Rich Voss, and interns (Oscar and Bobo), marked by crude jokes and insults directed at the interns, focusing on body odor, bodily functions (especially boogers), and physical appearance.  UFC president Dana White called in to discuss UFC 118 in Boston, offering insight into the fights, mentioning the Fan Expo and weigh-ins, and casually discussing personal preferences (like Pinkberry with mochi) and anecdotes about fighters. The disjointed and vulgar game of Pyramid continued.

The final excerpt began with a discussion of the upcoming UFC event in Boston, with Dana White promoting the event. The conversation shifted to Rich Voss's potential to open for a UFC fight. A highly offensive and vulgar exchange ensued between the hosts, Rich Voss, and Ira, filled with crude sexual innuendo, homophobic remarks, and personal insults, particularly targeting Bobo.  The hosts discussed their upcoming vacation, weekend plans (including Anthony's pool party and karaoke), and frustrations with the station's lack of promotional support. The show ended with more banter, packing up,  a rushed clarification about a supposed dislike of Jackie "the Joke Man," and further offensive comments about a person named Sam. The overall tone was highly unprofessional, characterized by crude humor, personal attacks, and a chaotic atmosphere.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:00:30]  We have low self-esteem as a show.  They are not doing anything.  They're not highly skilled.  They have no talent.  We're just exploiting people.  See, kids, smoke your pot, play your video games, and watch TV.  You'll be better off when you get R.A.  There's no ratings here.  No one cares.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning.  Morning, morning, morning.  Hola.  Hola.  How's everybody? 
[00:01:00]  Good.  Getting my volume together.  Look at that Mother Teresa.  Still going strong.  What?  100 years old.  100 years old today.  I wonder what she's doing for her birth.  She looks great.  Ah, er, ah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Empire State Building won't do the colors.  For Mother Teresa?  But don't they have a policy, though, of not doing any religious figures at all? 
[00:01:30]  I would imagine.  Religious figures, but they cover it for, uh, they color it up for Ramadan.  Rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah.  Yeah, but not people.  Oh, not people?  I think so.  I think they won't do it for...  They did it for Homer Simpson and Popeye.  Yeah.  Wait, they do it for Homer Simpson and Popeye, but not Mother Teresa?  Exactly.  Because you can kind of blow off the religious thing with her and just look at the humanity of this woman trying to help the world, 
[00:02:00]  living in horrible conditions to try to make a little difference.  By the way, in the end, she didn't make any difference.  No, of course not.  Take that, religious people.  They're still starving their asses off and eating their own foot fungus.  Oh, God.  They're back.  Dee-da-da-da.  Dee-da-da-da.  At least they gave a chance to see our favorite Catholic League president.  Oh, Bill Donahue.  Bill Donahue.  Where's that schmuck?  He was out in front of the Empire State Building protesting with a bunch of people that were dressed in blue and white. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, I thought he was blocking everyone's view.  Fat fuck.  He's a big boy.  Yeah.  I love that there's a building going up and just going to ruin the skyline and block the Empire State Building.  Blocking the Empire State Building.  Because if you know anything about New York City, everyone buys an apartment with a nice view.  You're like, look at my view.  It's all about the view.  And then within a year, there's a brick wall in front of your window.  Yeah.  So it's about time it happens to the Empire State Building. 
[00:03:00]  Empire State Building always had a view of everywhere.  Right.  You know, nothing blocking it.  Right.  And now they're building a building kind of next to it.  It's going to be big and fat and tall.  And the design sort of looks like a middle finger.  Did you see it?  Oh, really?  It's kind of one of those.  Yeah, man.  It is a shitty place to finger.  Yeah.  Fuck them.  Fuck the Empire State Building.  The skyline should always change.  Change it up, man.  I agree.  I'm bored with it.  But I do like that one. 
[00:03:30]  It does look good.  It changed in 2001, that's for sure.  Yeah.  I know.  Coming in from Long Island, it's weird not to see those two towers all the way down to the left.  Downtown's all short now.  Real short, right?  It's short.  What, are the Mexicans taking over?  I know.  It's short.  A lot of short people down that way.  You're on a roof waiting to be rescued.  That was five years ago.  Oh, that's not today?  No.  Why are they showing Mother Teresa and Katrina?  Katrina was five years ago, like a little while ago.  Or is it five years ago today? 
[00:04:00]  I have no idea.  Who gives a shit?  Vacation's hours away.  What am I talking about?  Oh, please.  I know.  Who cares?  This show means nothing.  Although you've got to watch out.  Tropical Storm Earl is bubbling away.  If Earl fucks my vacation down there in North Carolina, I'm going to find him and punch  him in the face.  Hello.  Sorry.  Sorry, Opie.  Where is this tropical storm?  Bubbling down south somewhere.  Is it sneaking into the Gulf area or is it sneaking on the East Coast? 
[00:04:30]  There's another one, though.  I'm not sure.  There's one that's already kind of a hurricane.  And then there's Tropical Storm Earl.  Really?  Oh, no.  Tropical Storm Danielle?  Danielle, yes.  Danielle, I guess, right?  Yeah.  A woman's name, yeah.  Yeah.  That thing is just spinning off to the right.  I don't give a shit.  Yeah, you've got to watch out.  I'm worried about the ones that spin off to the left.  Yeah.  Sharp lefts.  Yeah.  After getting around Florida.  You heading down there?  Oh, yeah.  Tomorrow.  Oh.  Tomorrow.  What time are you leaving? 
[00:05:00]  Ah, two-ish.  You get down to, what, 10 at night?  Or are you taking two days?  No, I'm stopping halfway.  I got a kid.  Oh, boy.  You can't do those nine-hour road trips anymore.  All right.  Just go straight through.  The kid's going to have a fucking fucked-up spine if you do that.  Oh, God.  You can't have him in a car seat for nine hours.  Just sitting there.  Oh, God.  Were you, uh...  He'll be so bummed out, because you'll be driving, he'll hear you two talking, but he's  facing backwards.  Backwards.  You'll be like, how come I can hear everything?  I don't see no one.  I'm seeing where I've been, not where I'm going.  He's a good traveler, man. 
[00:05:30]  He doesn't cry or anything.  It's good.  It's good so far, yeah.  Duct tape.  Duct tape to his mouth.  That's how you get those quiet trips.  Yeah.  Ah!  Where are you stopping?  Oh, I don't know.  Where's halfway?  I don't know.  Not Delaware.  I don't know.  Somewhere.  These are real answers, by the way.  I'm not trying to be a dick.  I'm wondering where halfway is to North Carolina.  It's the difference between me and my girl.  She likes...  She doesn't need everything planned out, but she would like to know where we're staying  Saturday night with our three-and-a-half-month-old son, and I'm like, I don't know. 
[00:06:00]  We got a GPS.  You pop up hotels.  We'll figure it out.  That's how I roll.  Oh, I can never travel like that.  You can't travel like that either?  Never.  Oh, I love doing that.  When we were off the air, I would just jump in my car and go, I think I'm going to drive  to Vegas today.  Then again, it would take a few days, and then I would just stop here and there.  Why not?  You couldn't do that?  Nah.  You would need to know where you're staying?  I'd like to know, yeah.  Oh, I hate that.  But I have to.  I'm used to...  I'm in hotels all the time. 
[00:06:30]  I always know.  I got to fly by the seat of my pants, man.  Oh, I can't.  And sometimes it gets scary.  Like when we were driving to Rochester from Philly, I guess.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because my brother-in-law had a kid.  We were running out of options and then had to stop at this truck stop area.  But then it turned out the hotel was nice, a Holiday Inn Express.  Oh.  It was nice.  But it was nice.  I don't need the fucking...  What are they?  Five stars now?  It was nice.  There's less than five stars.  I won't piss on the front door. 
[00:07:00]  I know.  I feel the same way.  What time does room service stop?  It doesn't.  I'd like a room, please.  Yes.  Although this guy saw me coming because I have a newborn.  I walk into the lobby with the newborn.  You have any rooms?  He looks at me and goes, we have one room left.  The executive suite.  The executive suite at the Holiday Inn Express.  What does that give you?  What do you think you got?  Nothing.  The toilet has a seat on it.  You know what you got?  I think it was called the executive suite.  Something like that.  A desk, right?  No, you got the jacuzzi tub right next to the bed. 
[00:07:30]  What the fuck?  Who needs that?  What?  Oh, Earl could screw your whole friggin' thing up.  Holy shit, it can.  Earl's like heading right for...  Why is there a big number three on it?  That means...  Category three.  That's a three already.  Wait the fuck.  Oh, no.  Yeah, I think Earl's heading right for you.  That'll make the waves nice.  I was kidding, by the way, about the five-star hotel thing.  Before anyone's...  He thinks he's really sick.  I wasn't.  No, but I'll stay in a fucking Marriott.  What do they call the courtyard by Marriott? 
[00:08:00]  I sleep better in those than any hotel in the country.  Really?  I don't know why.  I don't want to hear continental breakfast.  I don't either.  No.  No.  Any hotel that's got a continental breakfast can suck my cock.  This place had a continental breakfast.  I don't like that.  I want room service.  They had Froot Loops in a tube, and you just...  Oh, God.  That's all I need in the morning.  How about if you could have a Delta breakfast?  Oh, okay.  See, you want to fuck me with my vacation, Ant. 
[00:08:30]  You had to put that in my head, but I got Joe, who's nice.  Oh.  He writes, Earl's expected to follow Danielle and turn north.  Only riptides expected in North Carolina.  They didn't just show that.  Bikini...  Bikini...  What was the drink I used to drink?  Bikinitini's?  Bikini-teenies?  Bikini-teenies.  Was it Bikini-teeny?  Yeah, it was, right?  They didn't just show that.  Well, I trust Joe instead of the news.  I just saw Thurl plowing right into the coast. 
[00:09:00]  I made a major statement there.  I'd rather trust Joe on instant feedback.  Oh, you'd rather trust him.  No, I think I do trust Joe more than the news.  The news has to make it into something, so we watch.  Joe doesn't.  Joe doesn't need the audience.  He's got no ulterior motives.  Hell fucking no.  Well, Joe's a boob.  Well, we go down there.  We haven't been down there in a few years, but we're doomed to get fucked one of these trips.  Yeah.  Because my brother's been washed out a couple times with hurricanes down there. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  It's a hurricane area.  It really is.  This time of year, that's why it looks like that.  Yeah.  Been hit with a few.  See, another guy going to the outer...  Oh, no, it's Sarah from Buffalo.  Fuck Sarah.  We should hook up, man.  I mean, not in that way, you know.  Sarah's going to be in the Outer Banks as well, and we're hoping for no hurricanes either.  Oh, well.  That'll be a nice thing, to just have a listener hanging out with you. 
[00:10:00]  They hang out at your house.  I can't hang out with Sarah for the afternoon on the beach.  Psychopaths.  And her family.  Yeah.  So, anyway.  The listeners.  I want to talk about the cake boss.  Oh.  Cute story.  Yeah, I don't really watch the cake boss.  I've seen it a few times.  I've seen it a few times.  Yeah, I wouldn't watch a show about cake.  Know who loves...  Oh, God.  Who?  Guess who loves cake boss? 
[00:10:30]  E-Rock.  Of course.  I knew it.  E-Rock looks like a cake.  Not only does he love the cake boss, he actually got one of their really over-the-top expensive  cakes.  He did?  Yep.  For what?  For, I think, a special occasion for his brother or something.  Can we get him in here?  I would love to know what he was.  They're extremely overpriced cakes.  How much?  They look terrific, but they taste like shit.  How much harder, do you think?  He'll tell you.  Well, why don't you take your time?  I know we're a day away from vacation.  Poor E-Rock. 
[00:11:00]  But you just saunter away, sir.  He's trying to walk fast, but his little heavy arms are just hustling.  Look at him, he's on a swing.  Yeah.  He looks like that fucking Sasquatch in that 67-footage.  The guy that fell off the horse?  Yeah.  So, E-Rock, you the cake boss?  Yeah, I watched the first season and then gave up on the second season.  Oh, really?  Why?  Oh, is that good?  He wants to look tough.  No, I was just getting really stupid.  Why is it stupid?  Because it was...  Because it's the same show over and over again.  Yeah, and then it became less and less about them making the cakes.  Yeah, but tell them about the wine. 
[00:11:30]  That was the exciting part.  Yeah, we need that damn cake!  All right, the flour!  How much tension is there?  Make it, fucking...  Put the Duncan Hines in, you fucking cocksucker.  We got two o'clock!  Cake's coming!  That was drama.  No reality shows making cake.  You're right, it stinks.  Exactly.  They show the wedding.  Do you accept this woman?  I do.  There's a cake!  You guys in the back, where's the cake?  Cakes are here!  Dramatic music, I'm sure, yeah.  The hands shaking. 
[00:12:00]  They're trying to get Michael J. Fox to write something on it.  He keeps fucking up the cake!  He said, hurry, you're going for us!  That doesn't say happy birthday.  Right before the commercial, it's so dramatic.  No!  And they show someone...  Commercial.  They show Edmund Muskie having a stroke and falling into the cake.  Muskie.  And the wreck of the Edmund McMuskie.  All right, sorry.  Sorry.  Hey, look at the right turn, Anthony.  Why are you fucking scaring me on purpose like that?  That's not Earl. 
[00:12:30]  That's not Earl?  No, that's Danielle.  Oh, that is Danielle.  That's Danielle.  Now, show Earl, for fuck's sake.  How do you know that?  How did you know that?  Oh, I've been keeping track of the hurricanes.  No, no, but it's just lying on the thing, and he knew which one it was.  Oh, I keep an eye on the hurricanes.  It had a name at the top of the screen.  Yes, of course.  Death of Danielle.  What was the most dramatic thing that happened on Cake Boss when you were watching E-Rock?  Most dramatic and the most stupid was they're making a traditional Italian cake, Italian wedding cake, and they need doves in a cage to put on the top. 
[00:13:00]  So they send two of the big fat cake makers out to the park, and they're catching pigeons.  Like, it was just really stupid shit.  What happened?  Sounds great.  Yeah, but they made it like it was so dramatic because they couldn't find doves, so they had to go and get pigeons.  They were going to get pigeons instead, and they made a whole story out of nothing.  Oh, that's a cute story.  What happened?  Obama and Michelle.  Right?  What cake did you, Sharpton, what cake did you order? 
[00:13:30]  We had a cake made for my brother's 40th birthday.  It was a big beach with palm trees, tiki statues, Hawaiian hula dancers, and the ocean.  Don't say the price.  No, I can't.  You can't.  No, you're going to say the price.  Fuck the cake, boss, and the ass.  No.  Why? 
[00:14:00]  No, it's not because.  Oh, they gave you a deal?  You don't want to be ridiculed for how much it cost?  Hold on.  Why can't we say the price if this motherfucker didn't give you a deal?  Because his wife went in half on the cake, and she didn't want him to know how much she spent on the cake.  So tell your brother not to listen to this part of the show.  Yeah, I won't say it.  I'm just curious.  I'm certainly going to say the price.  Oh, no, I'm not going to.  Because people need to know how ridiculous the price is on these cakes.  So did the cake boss know who this show is, or no, he didn't?  Maybe he was.  He sort of knew.  Buddy actually didn't, but his whole staff does. 
[00:14:30]  That means Buddy knows.  But Buddy has to be too cool for the room, I guess.  So what, they didn't want to give you any discount?  No, they knocked a few hundred off the price.  What?  How much was this cake?  Thank you, Jimmy.  They knocked a few hundred off the cake.  A few hundred?  Right.  Go to Carvel.  It's fucking, what's better?  Oh, my God.  Let me see.  That's before tax and all that.  Yeah.  $94 is fucking sickening for a cake.  Why would you spend $94? 
[00:15:00]  You forgot a zero, by the way.  You got 94, a decimal point, and then a zero.  A decimal point, because the rest is the change.  Because if that's a 940, I'm going to bite your fucking fingers.  Stab you at the pen like Pesci.  Before tax.  And the discount.  So the cake cost over $1,000.  Wow.  Sorry to E-Roc's family, but we have to say it.  It doesn't matter.  That's ridiculous.  What are you paying for?  His artistry?  Was there sand in the cake?  Yeah, the sand was made out of ground-up graham cracker.  How was the cake? 
[00:15:30]  Overrated?  The lucky rock just gave us.  Because to make it look good, they can't make it taste good.  They've got to use concrete on it and shit.  For $940...  It should not taste average like a cake you got at Sam's Flo.  It should taste like pussy.  Moist fucking pussy with whipped cream.  It looked amazing.  And they mixed trout into it.  You put some oil on it to get off of the beach.  You know, the golf...  So wait...  How shitty did the cake taste? 
[00:16:00]  It wasn't shitty, but it wasn't like, oh my god, this is the best cake I ever had in my life.  It was just...  It was...  It's just regular cake that looks really good because they make, you know, some nice designs on top.  Dude, you invited to a Carville ice cream cake.  Oh, it's delicious.  It's fucking phenomenal.  Fantastic.  There's nothing better than that.  Nothing.  Question, what?  $30?  Wow, that's unbelievable, Rock.  I mean, I understand why...  I mean, if he's a big fan of the show and all, whatever, but...  Just because it looks delicious doesn't mean it tastes delicious, right? 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, it was a bit disappointing.  Because look at what they use.  They use like...  Is that a cake?  Like that hard fucking shit on it.  I forgot what it's called.  Maybe some of the bakers could call it.  It's pretty cool.  It's a designing...  What?  Mars' wife uses it, too.  Yeah, Mars, what's that?  It's called fondant.  Fondant.  Fondant tastes like shit.  Not yet.  It's edible, but it doesn't really taste that good.  It's like spackle.  Because I've been at places where they have these designer cakes, and what you do is  you peel that shit off like a good scab, and then get to the actual cake.  Get to the good shit. 
[00:17:00]  Yes.  Everything on the cake was edible except for the...  But sort of edible.  Exactly, edible, technically.  Thank you.  Sort of edible.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, Brussels sprouts are edible as well.  I love Brussels sprouts, man.  I like them, too.  A little bit of lemon on them.  Dude, I love them.  What?  Love Brussels sprouts.  Do you like Brussels sprouts, too?  Yeah, you squeeze lemon on them.  A little salt.  Maybe my mom cooked them wrong when I was growing up.  She probably boiled them or made them too plain.  She boiled all our vegetables.  Yeah, it's no good.  Try eating boiled asparagus.  I dare you.  Oh, the way my mother used to make them. 
[00:17:30]  Ah, there's some man who got a little saucer out of the fingers of an extortion victim.  Growing up with seven kids, you'd just throw it in a pot and boil the shit out of it, and  then it was stringy.  The asparagus?  Yeah.  I hated asparagus until I finally had grilled asparagus.  It's a completely different taste.  Grilled is amazing, isn't it?  All the way my mother...  Oh, my mother made that asparagus so crisp you can hit a baseball with it.  Well, you can break the legs of someone who thought they were your friend. 
[00:18:00]  What?  Shit.  Oh, this cake boss.  You know, I was in Hoboken, and there's a line around this place.  Oh, he's in Hoboken?  And there's a line around the place every fucking day.  Really?  Some days they have to have the local police there to organize the line.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable.  They have barricades on the weekends.  You have to get a ticket, and it goes two and a half blocks from where the bakery is  located to where, if you know Hoboken, where the path station is.  So that's quite a distance.  I thought you were going to say where the turlets are, so you can shit out the cake. 
[00:18:30]  The turlet.  The turlets.  BJ in Jersey.  All right.  Yeah, you're going, boys.  By the way, this is leading to a great story that's in the paper about the cake boss people.  Go ahead, BJ.  Yeah, BJ.  Anyway, my wife pulled up late stuff on her mother's birthday.  They wanted $40 for a fucking slice of cake.  It was more than the goddamn meal at the party.  For a slice?  Wait.  $40 a slice.  You were going to just buy a slice? 
[00:19:00]  Or they were, that's...  No, make a cake for like, you know, 40 or 50 people.  They wanted $40 per slice, you know, for that many people.  Well, is that about right, E-Rock?  How many slices did you get from your cake?  If you had to guess.  The cake fed...  Uh-oh.  ...40 to 50 people.  40 people, so that's, uh...  Or two E-Rocks.  40 petal of E-Rocks face.  I know.  That's just fun.  But doing the math real fast, that's about $50 a slice, I think.  $50,000. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, I figured, yeah.  Oh, wait.  40 times...  50 times...  Wait, what?  40.  What's wrong with me?  $25 a slice, right?  Like, listen, the old people suck, man.  I know, I'm sorry.  No, no, no.  50 times $40 a slice.  50 times 10 is 500.  Do that times four, 2,000.  2,000 dollars?  Yeah.  But his cake was 1,000, so it's $25 a slice.  How much was your cake, sir?  His was $40 a slice.  Right, okay.  It would have been like $2,000 for that.  Wow.  Jesus.  It's weird.  It's like...  Oh, wait.  Your cake cost $2,000? 
[00:20:00]  I'm slow today.  I'm sorry.  Wow, BJ.  What the fuck?  What did it taste like?  No, we didn't fucking like it.  Oh, you said, fuck you.  I'm going to Dairy Queen.  Nice.  Man, you know, like, when you're 15 minutes of saying we're up, then tell me what the  fucking slice is going to be.  Yeah, that's all because the show is on.  They're smart.  What a good location, because Hoboken, you got Jersey, New York.  I mean, there's a lot of people around here.  I'm not faulting.  If I ever had a reality show, that FH Riley's, if we had a line, oh, fuck, those prices  are going up, fuck everybody, $100 a plate, man, for the privilege of eating at FH Riley's. 
[00:20:30]  I would do that in a second.  They have banners of him in the bakery hanging off every street, like going down Washington,  and they renamed parts of the street, Cake Boss Way.  Did they?  Oh, that's wonderful.  Oh, this guy...  Exciting.  Listen to what happened to this guy.  David on Long Island.  David.  Yo, what up, guys?  What's up?  All right.  My girlfriend's 21st birthday, surprise party.  I take off work.  I drive to Hoboken, New Jersey. 
[00:21:00]  Like, what the fuck?  Whatever.  That's not the point.  I go there.  I call three days in advance.  Literally, you call that place.  Give the guy's number out.  You call the place.  You get hung up on, like, 35, 40 times.  It's like I want to buy a cake, you asshole.  Come on.  Like, you know.  They probably can't keep up with the orders is what it comes down to.  I mean, I guess.  I mean, I guess they can be, like, selective on their orders, but my cake was $1,500.  It's served, I think, about 50. 
[00:21:30]  I got 50, like, you know, good two-inch by two-inch slices out of it.  Two-inch by two-inch is not a good slice?  That's terrible.  It's a little cube.  The fuck is that?  Oh, would you care for a morsel of cake?  What, do you let it melt on your tongue like an ice slipper?  Two inches by two inches.  It's like a dice.  He's just cutting up little dice with it.  What the fuck?  How about you buy a fucking, a delicious Carvel cake?  Oh, they're wonderful.  Dairy Queen, brother. 
[00:22:00]  Or Dairy Queen, sure.  Dairy Queen rocks.  What?  The inside of it was Reese's Pieces, like, crunched up in it.  Big deal.  I'll buy you a bag for $3.  I know.  Throw them in the cake by the handful.  Reese's Pieces?  Come on.  Now let's slow down.  That shit is good.  Yeah, but they're not worth $1,000.  He must be laughing his ass off in that cake store.  Just laughing.  Rolling in the money, man.  Rolling in the dough.  You can't even just order a cake.  You have to schedule an appointment in order to discuss the cake that you may be approved 
[00:22:30]  to get, maybe approved.  What the fuck is this guy pulling?  How long does it take?  Went there to make the appointment, had the appointment two months later.  Shut up.  Had the appointment two months later, went in, and we told them what we wanted.  They sketched it out a little bit, and then they say, yes, we can do this.  Or they'll say, no, we don't have time to do this.  You have to wait two months for an appointment?  Two months for an appointment.  Ugh, this is the dumbest thing I've ever had.  And you had to put $100 down to reserve the appointment.  Wow.  To reserve the appointment? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Now is it refundable?  You get it back, or you apply it to the cake that you're going to order.  So if you're denied your cake, you get your $100 back.  Return to your credit card, yes.  Wow, that must be an amazing...  Let's go to CJ in Atlanta.  CJ.  Imagine getting denied for a cake.  Yeah.  You'd shoot yourself and you'd leave.  Well, I'm sure people come up with some pretty...  Weird ideas.  Yeah, you know.  I want rapists to, you know.  I wonder if they're going to have a cake based on what happened to one of their employees. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, boy.  Now that would be a great episode of Cake Boss.  That would be not much cake material, and you don't need anything to make pubic hair.  Whoa.  Hey, could you guys make a car, and I need a head going back and to the left, and a little cake bullet.  And some jelly on the rear trunk lid.  Let's say hi to CJ.  Hi, CJ.  By the way, the listeners don't miss anything.  You know how that guy was talking over everybody, and he got hung up a lot. 
[00:24:00]  I know the listeners are like, no wonder this guy got hung up on by the cake boss.  Yes.  A lot of Z.  Probably babbling.  He probably wanted a Z cake.  CJ, go ahead.  It's my turn now.  Yes, it is.  All right.  No, I saw an episode of this stupid show.  The whole damn thing was about them starting to make a golf course-themed cake, and then he was freaking out, whatever the guy in charge name is, because he's never played golf, and he didn't know anything about it. 
[00:24:30]  So then the entire episode was about them going to play golf, these fat fucking douchebags.  So they do things like that to kind of jazz the show up?  Yeah.  The show is a massive hit for TLC.  Massive.  Remind me never to sing Sad But True karaoke the day before a show.  What happened?  Well, you know, when you sing Metallica, balls out.  Oh, your voice is a little, yeah.  I like a raspy, Anthony. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, a little raspy today.  I like that.  A little party last night?  Oh, just kicking it out.  Nah, just a little fucking pool and a little karaoke.  But, yeah, singing very loud.  I have some ideas for that bass in the years, by the way.  Oh, do you?  Yeah.  A little basketball court.  A little Nerf hoop.  A little Nerf hoop.  Maybe a kiddie pool right in the middle.  Right by the card table.  Nice.  Yeah.  That leads to the cake boss story. 
[00:25:30]  So, E-Rock, so.  I'm on a cake with a woman's face and a fist and a black eye.  Could you make that for me?  Could you make a pinball machine?  Eight dicks and spread legs.  Yeah, I don't blame the guy for deciding what kind of cakes he wants to make.  You got to think some of the ideas are just completely whacked.  That would be a good show.  Some of the ideas people had for cakes that they obviously can't make.  Too interesting.  Probably.  So, how do you say this guy's name? 
[00:26:00]  Trouble.  Yeah, no kidding.  That's what he's in.  And the fat, balding white guy, I'm going to try to help you out today from Cake Boss.  I think I got a lawsuit for you.  What is it?  Remy Gonzalez?  Remy.  I'm going to guess Remy.  Remy, we'll go with Remy Gonzalez, Cake Boss, brother-in-law.  Brother-in-law of the main guy?  Is charged with sexually assaulting teen in New Jersey.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Is that true?  They have a little Lacey and Connor cake? 
[00:26:30]  Listen, I need you to make a tub and five little tufts of cake hair.  Because you make five tufts of cake hair.  And one crying psycho.  I need salty tears and five tufts of cake hair.  Tufts.  Where did Iraq go?  Oh, that's great.  We don't know these people.  He was talking about cake.  Remy Gonzalez, the brother-in-law of Cake Boss, Buddy Valastro. 
[00:27:00]  And a main character.  He's one of the main guys in this show.  Iraq.  Iraq.  I've actually never seen this guy on camera.  They're saying he's one of the main characters in the TLC show based on Carlos Bakery in Hoboken.  Has been arrested on charges.  He sexually assaulted a teenager.  Oh.  Remy Gonzalez, 32, of East Hanover, was arrested August 17th.  And admitted to witnesses, he assaulted the teen in March in East Hanover and some park.  Gonzalez is charged in both towns. 
[00:27:30]  Wow, he did this in two towns.  With first and third degree aggravated sexual assault, second degree sex assault, third degree endangering, and fourth degree.  How many degrees does this shit go up to?  Fourth degree criminal sexual contact of the 14-year-old teen on March 9th, according to criminal complaints.  Yikes.  $300,000 bail.  The victim claimed to have been sexually assaulted by Gonzalez.  Gonzalez, the witness, whose identities were not disclosed, had confronted Gonzalez on August 13th. 
[00:28:00]  Let's guess the girl's parents.  You have to assume the girl or boy's parents.  What?  Witnesses?  Yeah, because they're not identifying them.  And I'm guessing it's because of the parents.  I mean, because of the relationship to the kid.  Okay, and he denied sexually assaulting the teen.  The witness later told him they were going to take the teen to a doctor.  Sounds like parents.  Who would have to contact the police if anything were found.  And it was then that Gonzalez began to cry and admitted to the witness that he had engaged in acts of sexual assault and, yeah, sexual assault. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, boy.  The teen's gender was not disclosed.  Oh, no.  That's not a good sign.  Not disclosed.  Go figure.  A guy that makes decorative cakes might be, well.  This had occurred once in East Hanover and once in this park, and Gonzalez told the teen not to tell anyone what had happened.  I like that episode where they made the cake that was the Olivia Newton-John. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, God.  Where you just reduce recipe by half.  Hey, what are you taking us?  What are you scraping those off with a spatula for?  One of the witnesses also recorded a phone call with Gonzalez.  Really?  Oh, this guy's fucked.  I bet that's not a good one.  During the call, the witness said he, she, because we don't know what, you know. 
[00:29:30]  He, she, oh, no.  Yeah, imagine it's a he, she.  Could not believe this was going on.  You broke our hearts.  To which Gonzalez replied, I know, I know I did.  I know.  Also during the call, Gonzalez acknowledged having previously admitted on August 13th that he assaulted the teen,  but now said he only touched the teen's intimate areas.  Oh, boy.  That's not good.  It's got to be.  He grabbed a little cock.  Come on.  No, it's more than, it's got, if that's true, if that's true, it's probably more than that 
[00:30:00]  because you wouldn't be afraid of the doctor finding anything if there was no cock contact.  Oh.  What would the doctor find?  Maybe he'd try to shove it in the hiney.  Oh, in the dumper?  You're going to see a 14-year-old ass?  What is this guy?  You're a communist?  The poopy.  What are we, communists?  Yeah, say, listen, I need you to make a cake, a very smooth butthogs cake with little red dots running down the back leg.  It's called the sad cake. 
[00:30:30]  This guy pleaded.  Red dots.  In the blood.  In the phone call, he said, I made a mistake, wanted to get help, and to forget about it.  Let's just forget about it.  Forget about it.  So, this guy's in trouble.  But to the fat, kind of sweaty, bald guy that's on Cake Boss, what's his name?  You don't know?  I'm forgetting, though.  I would sue Fox 5 locally here in New York because they just did this whole story and showed you.  Because, obviously, this lazy news organization, this local Fox, they just had B-roll of Cake Boss as they're telling this horrific story, 
[00:31:00]  and they're showing the fat, sweaty, bald guy the entire time.  They're showing the guy that wasn't doing it.  So, I'm assuming right away, like, wow, that's got to be the guy that did all this.  And that's the guy that does the interviews for the cake.  Oh, really?  That's the guy you sat with?  Yeah, because you sit with him, and once he approves it, then you, if Buddy's not taping, then you get to meet.  I'm trying to help him out, because if he's walking around, he's probably going to get some dirty looks today,  because, you know, the B-rolls just showed him. 
[00:31:30]  Never showed this guy.  That's lazy shit on Fox's part.  It's just hard to find stuff on that guy.  They say he's a main character, but I don't remember ever seeing him on camera on that show.  Yeah.  Busy, you know, sucking little dicks.  That's not important.  We're shooting!  That wasn't important to the news.  They just need a B-roll.  So, you know, most people aren't smart enough to figure it out themselves.  So now they think the fat, sweaty, white, balding guy is the molester. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, is he a dirty boy?  This guy's fucked.  If he's true, he is, yeah.  You think it shuts down the show?  A 14-year-old victim is not good, but...  And he's the brother-in-law of the mean guy?  If he's not on camera a lot, if he's not the guy, maybe not.  Yeah.  They just won't address it.  I don't think it hurts it at all.  No.  Yeah.  You don't think...  You know, it's not him, not the guy.  Yeah.  I'm sure there's other cakes they could probably make. 
[00:32:30]  Without him?  Yeah.  Maybe he wasn't even that good anyway.  Maybe they could make the hat removal cake.  Maybe they could make an old lady with Frank Vincent hair and her hat flying off.  Just white cotton candy for her hair.  Yeah.  Black licorice for the fist. 
[00:33:00]  Dark chocolate.  Of course.  No, darker.  Are you sure about that?  Yes.  Yes.  A little vanilla for the nails.  The fist punching her in the face.  How funny would that be?  And the hat is in mid-air?  It's on like a little thin wire?  Yes.  Oh, shit.  Who's that?  Dead.  That's a little Wayne cake.  Oh, look at the dreads.  The dreads are made of black licorice. 
[00:33:30]  It's pretty good.  I don't know who answered that one.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, some good cake designs on the old internet there, right?  Heidi and Spencer.  I like them.  Oh, I like them.  Do you?  Yeah.  What?  You're such a liar.  Who are they?  From the hills.  From the hills.  Did you watch the hills?  I was at the hotel in L.A.  I don't know why they were shooting it one night, but no.  A shit cake.  How great is that?  With flies on the...  I love the flies on the duty cake.  No surprise. 
[00:34:00]  It's Japanese.  It's in Asian writing, of course.  It's probably a sincere cake.  It's probably real shit.  Yes.  For 20 years of marriage.  Right.  That's probably...  Knowing those fucks and their culture.  Yes.  You're so right.  My deepest love.  It's probably a sweet 16 cake.  Yes.  Remember how we met?  Oh, God damn.  Just horrible over there.  Crying girl with a duty on her.  I'd rather have a cake like that, though, than maybe a golf hole or something, right?  A tub girl cake?  Yeah.  Yeah, there is a tub girl cake.  We saw that once.  We saw the tub girl cake. 
[00:34:30]  We absolutely saw that once.  That's fucking horrendous.  Tub girl cake.  This guy was on camera.  Sammy and Queen.  Sammy.  Sammy.  Sammy.  What's up?  This Remy, he's been on TV this whole past season.  Oh.  He married one of the fat sisters, and they had a baby earlier this year.  Uh-oh.  He's fucked, man.  So that's the story.  He's a skinny-looking Mexican guy.  Well, the news didn't show him.  They chose the...  Who's the, like, kind of fat... 
[00:35:00]  Moro.  Moro?  I watch the show, so I know who all that fucking is.  All right.  So if you're watching the local news, you would assume Moro is the kid-toucher.  Yep.  Because they got lazy with their footage today, just showing B-roll.  All right.  Thank you, sir, for that info.  All right.  There's a tub girl cake.  Is there a meat spin cake?  No way.  Is there a meat spin cake?  Oh, the cake I made, like this, like this.  I am Enzo, the beggar.  Enzo.  I fucked the girl. 
[00:35:30]  She's 14.  She's 14.  What the fuck was that?  I put a meat spin cake, and I found some girl just vomiting on a cock.  A giant one.  And she's gagging and then vomiting all over the plane.  Oh, God.  Let me see that guy.  That is so sick.  That is disgusting.  Oh, that's great.  Adam.  Hey, guys. 
[00:36:00]  Jerry.  Jerry?  Done.  Jerry?  No, Jerry.  Whatever.  Too late, Jerry.  Sorry.  Jerry?  Jerry?  Jerry!  Hey, by the way, fucking Tiger Woods.  I know we don't have a lot of golf fans, but it's a pretty interesting story that he goes  out and shoots a 65 yesterday after his divorce was finalized two days prior.  Yep.  This guy is back focusing on golf. 
[00:36:30]  He's had a shitty, shitty season.  The fucking divorce is final.  A day, two days later, he shoots a 65, and he's leading the Barclays.  It's the weight off his shoulder.  You think?  That's what I say.  Pretty impressive.  Pretty impressive.  Who knows?  He'll probably fall apart, but not a bad start for the guy who's had a real shitty year.  He's back.  He's back.  Better than ever.  He's back.  He is, though.  I think he's absolutely back.  Just needed to get that weight off his shoulders. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Now he's back.  Let's say hi to Andrew in Hoboken.  Andrew.  Andrew.  Andrew.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Not today.  I just have me getting into town right now in Hoboken, and there's fucking 50, 75 people  outside the bakery, and they're going to open for an hour and a half.  Oh, that's just the victims' families.  There's more victims coming forward, and they can't wait to talk to the boss.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Imagine it has nothing to do with cakes today. 
[00:37:30]  It's just all sad families, and they want to get their hands on that fucker.  All right, man.  Yeah, that'd be fucking bad news.  All right, Andrew.  Thank you.  Yeah, the guy does great business over there.  Yeah, I mean...  Oh, see?  You see, the guy had to explain this.  Jay on Long Island.  Go ahead.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Yeah.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  All right.  Thanks a lot, buddy.  How you doing, man?  I love the phone calls that are supposed to be five seconds, and two minutes later, we're  finally getting to it.  We're finally getting to the point.  Go! 
[00:38:00]  No, hey, come on.  Give the guy a break.  He's trying to do a...  Hey, buddy, hold on a second.  All right, go ahead.  What do you got to say?  All right, listen.  Let me ask you, man.  Did you actually think that guy was real or no?  No, no, no.  That's from Family Guy, man.  Oh, see?  So you think that the guy was just saying that?  Yeah, he was full of shit.  Oh, see?  Thanks, buddy.  What do you think he was doing?  Just kind of going for the joke?  I think he was just going for the joke.  Stupid fucking joke.  Dude, you're right, man.  See, we didn't see that. 
[00:38:30]  You're absolutely right.  Yeah, he's a fucking dick.  Now, you know what, dude?  It's like a lot of people aren't going to know how to call.  What else is going on?  Nothing much, man.  I just wanted to say that.  I'll let you guys go.  No, no, no.  I appreciate that, man.  Thanks a lot for the call.  All right, boys.  Have a good day.  Call back any time.  All right, I will.  Stay from home.  Hey, Jay.  What's up?  How needy are you that you didn't notice that Jimmy was doing nice Jimmy?  That was super nice Jimmy. 
[00:39:00]  How needy are you that you couldn't figure it out?  I wanted to try extra nice Jimmy.  Extra nice Jimmy.  I mean, people did pick up on it.  I just thought he had a good point.  He was being nice.  I wasn't.  I was being just nice for no reason.  The point was dreck.  It was really on.  Your call was dreck.  All right, Jay.  Bye, Jay.  Have a good weekend.  Hey, you didn't call him, Jay.  Oh, this is a very good Tiger Woods observation coming in, guys. 
[00:39:30]  Extremely good observation.  20 minutes, we might hear it.  Go ahead, Chris.  Hey, Chip, it's probably pretty hard to go off with a ball and chain on your ankle, right?  It's Chip.  I get it, Chip.  You're right, Tom, man.  This guy's a tiger.  He's uncaged right now, right?  Fuck, I was hoping he was...  I hope he was going to do that as a serious fucking phone call.  Of course not.  Hey, by the way, our favorite rock star fell off the stage last night.  Which one?  Scott fucking Douchebag.  Weiland?  Mm-hmm.  Good.  I guess he was so high he couldn't perform, man. 
[00:40:00]  I'm so high.  I'm so high.  I'm so high.  I'm so high.  I'm so high.  I'm so high.  I'm so high.  I'm so high.  I'm so high.  I'm so high.  I'm so high.  I'm so high.  I'm so high.  I'm so high.  I'm so high.  I'm so high.  I'm a crazy rock guy.  Ah, you asshole.  I'm struggling with demons.  Yeah, man.  They've got me.  I'm not created without them, man.  I'm a tortured artist.  Yeah, but my challenge overrides my faults. 
[00:40:30]  Don't give a shit that everyone around me is frustrated.  It's the pain that makes him good.  And it pains me because I love STP's music.  I really do.  But this fucking guy's an asshole.  Yeah.  I hope he broke his fucking hip, cocksucker.  How many hours did he make the audience wait, and then he finally walked out there and  fell?  Oh, Jimmy, I love that take.  Love it.  Horrible footage from someone's cell phone.  It's on TMZ, by the way. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, that's a good one.  Oh, boy.  He did.  He got like whiplash when he fell.  Did the shark just stop?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Maybe some...  Well, people realize you can't get the sound from a fucking cell phone when you hold it  up.  It just cannot handle that fucking sound.  It's brutal.  But he fell off the stage last night, so I hope he's not doing well.  Go for him.  Fuck him.  Fuck that asshole.  That was...  He was just strutting on the stage and ran out of stage. 
[00:41:30]  And just like got whiplash and fell down.  Nothing worse, though, when you realize there's no ground beneath you.  Yeah, it's like when you miss that step.  Oh, that is the weirdest fucking feeling.  When you think you're at the bottom of the stairs and there's one more step.  Yeah.  Or when you're at the bottom of the stairs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, you break your teeth for some reason.  There's no step and you go down like there is a step.  Yeah.  Oh.  You think he's tortured, Jimmy?  Yeah, man.  This guy really...  What do you think was going on in his head, do you think?  I don't know, man. 
[00:42:00]  But just the pain and the music's just coming out.  He doesn't even see the stage ending.  You think he spends most of his day going, people just don't understand me.  They don't understand when I go through my process.  To be creative is so much pressure.  You fucking faggot rock star.  It's not the 70s, asshole.  Exactly.  Not Jim Morrison.  Oh, he is a fucking douche.  We saw it. 
[00:42:30]  We saw it up close and personal.  We were lucky to see two incidents.  I fucking hate the coddled rock star.  Despise.  Well, he's so pained.  And that's what makes him talented.  It's a double-edged sword.  The best was we need to clear the entire stage before Scott gets off the bus.  Yeah.  Really?  Can we get everybody off the stage?  Really?  Scott's going to be coming through.  He doesn't want anyone looking at him.  Like I said, it pains me because I'm a big fan of their fucking music. 
[00:43:00]  I know.  The way you announced him on the air.  Yeah, fuck him.  Oh, all right.  This guy's a photographer.  Scott in Detroit.  You really were at the show, Scott?  Yes, I really was.  I actually have a gallery on my website.  If you so choose, look at the shots.  Oh, my God.  What's this?  Home invasion?  I know.  What happened?  Actually, I've got to kill the show for a second.  Every time you talk, that happens.  There's going to be a fire alarm, and there's an audible fire alarm, and the thing behind  you there is going to sound off. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, cool.  In a few minutes.  Like when?  Then we're not killing the show.  Can we bet?  Are you going to hear it?  What time?  Can we make bets on when it's going to go off?  Okay.  When is it going off?  He's there in a few minutes.  All right, so we've got a few minutes.  Can he give us a moment?  How about a 30-second notice instead of some vague...  Why are you panicking?  Why are you panicking?  Mars is panicking.  Mars just came in here and tried to stop the show for something that's happening in  a little while.  Hey, listen.  At 1130 when Ron and Fez are on.  Right.  Hey!  What the fuck's wrong with him? 
[00:44:00]  Go ahead, photographer.  What if there's a real fire during the fire alarm test?  I'll sue everybody.  That'd be ironic.  Scott, go ahead.  Okay.  Anyways, yeah.  It was at Susan Addy.  And, you know, he was late as usual, fashionably late.  This was like my fifth time.  How late was he this time?  You know, half his fans have fucking curfews, you asshole.  How late was he?  We lost this guy, and this is the guy we needed, too.  The phones are playing opposite phones. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  There he is, dude.  The tortured fucking rock star.  That bothers you, huh?  What a fruit.  I hate it because the rock guys I like that were fuck-ups.  There's just an attitude, guys.  Yeah, just the rebel, and there's nothing fun or friendly about him.  Just like a cunt.  Just like a cunt.  He is really just a prick.  Yeah.  Look at him.  Flipping the bird.  His very serious face. 
[00:45:00]  God, I wish that guy would go back.  One of those guys who thinks he's a genius.  I want to know how late he was this time.  That's what turned me off to Guns N' Roses.  I sat in, I think it was, I have to go way back, but I think it was Toronto.  It was easily two hours between, I've got to get my bands right.  Who the fuck was the other band?  Sister Sledge?  I think it was Skid Row.  Sister Sledge.  But I think it was about a two-hour wait as we all waited for Axl.  What a piece of shit. 
[00:45:30]  And the show was so good.  I forgot who else was there.  This goes back almost 20 years, but the show was rocking.  It was Toronto.  It was outside.  It was a nice summer night, and it was flowing nice.  And then, all right, Guns N' Roses is next, and it was literally two hours later.  Two miserable hours.  By the time they hit the stage, it was still great because it was Guns N' Roses in their prime,  but it just took the energy out of the entire fucking place.  Of course.  Hope that guy calls back.  Oh, he's calling back.  All right.  Scott, okay, go ahead. 
[00:46:00]  So how late was he?  Well, you know, he's only about 15 minutes late,  but I've shot him before where he's been at 45 minutes to an hour late.  15 is obviously reasonable.  Well, a half hour is reasonable between the opener and the headliner.  Because you don't always know what the problem is, yeah.  That's fine.  But when it gets up to that hour range, that's when it starts getting ridiculous.  Yeah.  Yeah, I've actually seen Guns N' Roses before where they've been well over an hour late as well.  Right.  But anyways, so back to the show.  But, you know, because I've photographed him before, and he's come out,  and he's just totally butchered the first song for getting lyrics coming in too early. 
[00:46:30]  But this show, I can honestly say he appeared to be sober as sober gets.  Okay.  I think what happened was, you know, they're supposed to put tape lines along the edge of the stage.  And I believe the roadies forgot to do it because after he fell, and he was down there,  he fell between the stage and the actual subwoofers between the stage.  You know, there's maybe a foot and a half of empty space, and he just dropped like a wet rag.  But I tell you what, he did not miss a beat. 
[00:47:00]  Like, my first thought was he was lip-syncing, but he wasn't because next thing you know,  after about 30 seconds his head popped up, and he was still singing, man.  It was, I give the, he's a total rock star.  Absolutely.  I mean, it was a great show.  It was a really good show.  Maybe he's got some of his shit figured out because, you know,  our experience goes back a couple years at this point.  Yeah, but if you guys want to see pictures, if I can maybe plug my website.  I got a gallery up there of shots.  You know what, after this great phone call, I really, yeah, that's fine. 
[00:47:30]  What's your website?  It's Rockstar.  Hey, Craig, Nassau County, how are you, sir?  Hey, guys, how are you?  First time caller.  What?  A little comment about the whole Tiger Woods situation, playing well.  Sure.  Up at Ridgewood Country Club, near the course, there's a couple of Perkins and Waffle Houses.  So I think that's helping his game a little bit.  Oh, Jimmy, you missed that because Jimmy's reading the paper. 
[00:48:00]  What are you reading over there?  It's a paper about, uh, you missed his comment on Tiger.  Oh, what did you say?  I said up near Ridgewood Country Club, there's a couple of Perkins and Waffle Houses.  So that's helping out Tiger's game, if you know what I mean.  Yeah, but he doesn't just eat that, dude.  He's eating at the Waffle House?  That makes no sense to me.  Yeah, I don't understand.  You guys don't get it?  No, you're saying he's eating at the Waffle House, so what?  Yeah, Perkins and Waffle House, that's why. 
[00:48:30]  The waitresses...  I got it!  Another needy fuck.  What a dunce.  You stupid chode.  Oh, he hung up.  Come on, Craig.  We're fucking around.  We're fucking around.  What a douche.  Let's say hi to David in North Carolina.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  How are you?  Hey, I think that probably another reason Tiger's playing better is that there's most 
[00:49:00]  likely a gag order on the divorce, and Elon can't talk about HGH.  That's why she gave the interview to people instead of Sports Illustrated.  Yeah, I basically can't disparage him in any way or talk about it.  If you're an athlete like Tiger Woods and you're going to be doing steroids, if he was, I have  no idea.  Wouldn't you kind of hide that from your wife as well?  You're hiding all the pussy.  Why would you fucking take needles right in front of her?  She may have found something. 
[00:49:30]  No, not necessarily, but she would probably know about it.  I mean, it's not...  You know, I don't think he'd shoot up at the dinner table, but...  The guy doesn't look like someone that's on roids.  He looks like some guy that works out a lot.  Really?  I hear he's a monster in the gym.  Yeah.  But, you know, but then also the roids make you a monster in the gym, so who knows?  I don't know.  The people on roids have that roid look.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah. 
[00:50:00]  That's...  All right, boys.  Punch it out.  That's true.  That's a good theory, David.  Thank you.  Wrestler look.  I think...  I mean, I think for the people out there that have gone through divorces, you understand  why Tiger is playing well.  Yeah.  He doesn't have to worry about the divorce shit anymore.  He's very happy.  And now he can focus on what he likes doing, which is fucking Perkins waitresses.  Oh, yeah.  And golf.  That's what the other caller said.  Yeah.  Let's take a break. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, I gotta eat.  Fire alarms are going off all over this joint.  Are they?  Are they blinking?  After all that, Mars, it's not blinking in here.  There's nothing happening in here.  Right.  So...  Is Washington Bobby in today, both of them?  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Okay.  Well, we brought Bobby back because we got some UFC shit, right?  118 is happening this weekend in Boston?  Yeah, I would love to go to that.  That's great for Dana White and the gang.  Yeah.  Congratulations to Juliana.  And Couture's fighting, right?  Dana.  Randy Couture's fighting.  And BJ Penn, right?  Both guys I've had differences with.  On the show.  Yes.  Those videos do really well, man. 
[00:51:00]  You showed them, though.  Fucking BJ took me off guard and Randy fucking had me and I had to, like, elbow out.  You know, in honor of him doing UFC 118, I'll retweet the PJ, PJ, the BJ Penn, Jim Norton thing.  It's great.  It's a good one.  And the Randy Couture choke out is really good, too.  Yeah.  All right.  So we got Voss on next.  Bob Kelly a little later.  Oscar, also, it's Oscar's last fucking day, which sucks.  Man, you win. 
[00:51:30]  We were just getting to know Oscar.  But he's going to do Pyramid today.  We hardly knew ye.  He's going to do a round of Pyramid.  The $25,000 Pyramid.  Yeah, I think Rich is going to work with one of these guys, Oscar.  And Bob Kelly's going to work with maybe Bobo, because I think Bobo's here.  Blow, blow.  And I think we're going to do a little $25,000 Pyramid with those guys.  Remember when we did it with Tippi Tom, how great that was?  We were listening to that in the office yesterday.  That clip of Tippi Tom will make me laugh every single time I hear it. 
[00:52:00]  Well, let's play it today.  Which one?  Why don't we get Ira to play?  We can't have Ira until 10.  We have the clip real quickly.  What?  What is he doing until 10?  He's doing Jay Thomas' show.  Jay Thomas.  Thomas.  We get him at 10, though.  We're going to have fucking Ira on today.  We got it.  Absolutely.  We got it.  Before vacation, I need a little Ira.  Ira's everyone's new favorite.  Put it on the website. 
[00:52:30]  That's right.  It's going to be warm 75 degrees under sunny skies.  So Jewish.  Ira rules.  Oh, God.  What is that?  Oh, what?  Fire.  Oh, did you hear?  It was fire.  I see something blinking. 
[00:53:00]  Everything blinking?  Oh, that one's blinking right there.  Probably just me again.  Oh.  Oh, phew.  That's blinking.  I thought I was having a stroke.  Okay, we're all right?  Yeah, don't look at it.  You'll get a Pokemon seizure.  Holy shit.  Right, right, right, right, right.  Watch that.  What was that?  What else?  Ira?  Ira, Bobo, Oscar, Rich Voss, Bob Kelly.  We're actually trying the day before vacation?  No, we're loading it up.  I wouldn't call that trying.  We're loading it up with people so we don't have to do anything.  Oh, that's true.  Yeah, let's call that stacking the deck.  Right, phoning it in.  One guy just wrote, I'm never calling this show again. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, come on, hopefully all of you.  The phones just went dead.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  You got 30 seconds, Papa Rock, to make Francine say what's on the paper, okay?  He's thinking.  All right, what is it?  Whisper it to everybody, Jimmy, out there.  Things on a plane.  You didn't hear that, did you, Francine?  Things on a plane.  All right, here we go.  Here's Papa Rock.  Go.  Stewardess. 
[00:54:00]  What?  Aeroplane.  Things on a plane.  Oh, wait a minute.  But it wasn't you.  Oh, wait a minute.  But it wasn't you.  Oh, wait a minute.  Opium entry show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  I'm leaving a southern train only yesterday.  You lie.  Man.  This is what I seem to be. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, wait a minute.  Jimmy's favorite band, S.T.P.  S.T.P.  S.T.P.  S.T.P.  S.T.P.  We say good morning to Rich Voss.  What's going on, kids?  Who has, he's freaking me out because he looks completely different.  I know. 
[00:55:00]  I guess we all figured out it's his brand new teeth are finally in after 20 years.  I know.  And they're completely normal teeth of perfect proportion to your head, not big horse teeth  anymore.  It's amazing.  We threw out all the sugar cubes out of the house.  Apples.  How many years has it been?  Since they started doing this?  We've known you for, what, 10 years now?  Yeah.  You've been dealing with teeth problems since then, right? 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  And now, finally, 10 some odd years later, you've finally got normal looking teeth.  Well, the bottom ones now, I mean, because they go all the way through.  Why don't you just go and get them all fucking taken out and put in?  They look good.  What are you waiting for?  I just did that.  What are you waiting for?  Now your lips don't know what to do.  Listen.  His lips look like you just lost a lot of weight immediately.  Are you just completely stupid?  No, I'm not completely stupid.  I just had these done, so I'm doing the bottom.  I got to do the bottom.  It took two years. 
[00:56:00]  You just said completely stupid.  I said completely.  Can you rewind that, Travis?  Completely.  Completely stupid.  Put your headphones on.  Enjoy.  Travis, you got that?  Yeah.  It's worth the wait.  Trust me.  You heard it, too?  Oh, yeah.  It's fantastic.  This is turning into a real morning show.  Ooh.  Perish that thought.  Holy Jesus. 
[00:56:30]  That's your favorite song, Jimmy.  No.  That was based on sarcasm, you asshole.  Jimmy has a problem with the lead singer, and so do I.  And we did a whole thing about that.  Then we come back from break with the STP song.  That's your favorite song, Jimmy.  Oh, okay.  See?  That's a lie.  It comes together.  I'm sorry I screwed up your morning zoo bit.  I didn't know that it was a song he didn't like.  All right?  Ooh. 
[00:57:00]  Do you have it?  Shut up.  Do we have this, Travis, or no?  Oh, he's got it.  Okay.  All right.  Here it is.  What are you waiting for?  Now your lips don't know what to do.  Listen.  His lips look like you just lost a lot of weight immediately.  Are you just completely stupid?  See, I said completely.  I said completely.  Immediately.  I know.  You kind of got the L in the last possible second.  All right.  One more time.  Immediately?  Are you just completely stupid?  No.  Completely stupid.  Completely. 
[00:57:30]  Completely.  I said completely.  What happens is your gum just flops around your mouth sometimes and wrecks everything  you're saying.  No.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  Listen closely.  You slid the L in one letter too late.  Completely.  Oh, I said completely.  Completely.  You said completely.  A little bit.  A little bit.  I can't stop looking.  I know what you're doing.  Exactly.  How great would it be?  I can't look at Rich's eyes.  I'm just looking at his choppers.  How great would it be if somebody knocked his teeth out?  Then we'd just screw him back in. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, really?  That's all it takes?  I can't look at him.  This is really bizarre.  Did it hurt when you went?  What's that?  When you go and have your teeth, how many did they do at one time?  What's the most they did?  It took two years.  They took out five at one time.  Or four.  The only thing that really bothered me is when they drilled through my gum into the bone.  Get out of here.  Yeah.  They drilled through your gum into the bone and they screw in the, what do you call it?  The implants.  The implant.  But he screwed into my gum into the bone. 
[00:58:30]  Then he put a metal rod into the hole and was banging it up with a hammer to do a sinus lift.  That was Dr. Gottesman.  Holden did the key.  He did a sinus lift?  What is a sinus lift for?  Well, it's pretty explanatory, you fucking idiot.  It's your sinus being lifted.  Oh, Travis.  Oh, it'll be D-Boy this time.  But that's not fair.  No, no, no.  You missed what he said.  What did I say?  Explanatory?  Explanatory.  Yeah, it should have been self-explanatory.  Oh, God.  Yeah, look.  People are saying it's pretty explanatory. 
[00:59:00]  Why?  What would be the word?  Self-explanatory.  Self-explanatory?  It's a huge difference.  Maybe I was in a hurry to get it out.  We know you're in a hurry.  Did they take the rod and bash it up about fucking a foot into your head, hitting the  frontal lobe?  No, he was...  But why a sinus lift?  I mean, did it help you breathe better?  I don't know all the technical reasons behind it.  But you might want to say why you're lifting my sinuses, sir.  Yeah, really? 
[00:59:30]  Are you driving a stake into my face?  Because when you put the implants in, they go up a certain length up into your gums.  And I guess you have to lift the sinus so there's a passage to breathe.  So how long, let me ask you, how long did it take that day when they took five?  Oh, no, you took four out one day.  Four teeth they pulled one day.  But we're missing the point that he's been hammering.  Yeah, a metal rod.  Get the fuck out of here.  I would love to fucking have five minutes without hammering that rod. 
[01:00:00]  I need to be hammering a rod in his mouth.  So, and then they cut my gums.  What kind of shit are you on?  Because you're like a recovering addict, so...  No, I took no painkillers.  What do you...  Did you really take...  You did all that without painkillers?  Yeah, what the fuck?  Well, Novocaine, right?  Novocaine.  I had Novocaine.  Why did you take painkillers?  No, we were filming Marathon Man 2.  So he was just drilling without...  Was the Novocaine good enough, though?  That was a good outlet.  Huh?  Yeah. 
[01:00:30]  I mean, sometimes...  Well, if you go back to the YouTube...  Yes, and all that shit, man.  Well, you guys videotaped on YouTube, you could see the Novocaine being...  Yeah, can we have the explanatory clip?  Hold on.  But, Rich, how...  We found the explanatory.  What is a sinus lift for?  Well, it's pretty explanatory, you fucking idiot.  It's pretty explanatory, you fucking idiot.  That's great.  Why...  It's explanatory.  Why don't you take painkillers, like, for...  Like, I'll take them when I really need them, and then I never finish the dosage.  Like, I'll take a couple.  But for teeth pain, man, for a surgery? 
[01:01:00]  No, but it wasn't that...  Oh, it wasn't that bad?  You've got to know your level of pain.  Well, can I jump in?  Because I have a lot to add to this.  Yes.  Because yesterday was one of the best Ron and Fez shows I've ever heard in my life.  Because Ronnie came back from his appendix operation.  And he's a recovering addict.  And he went through this thing.  Does he take painkillers or not?  It was amazing radio.  And Ronnie basically said that he couldn't find it in himself to trust himself enough to take a few painkillers to get through the pain and be able to get out on the other side without being an addict again. 
[01:01:30]  But he had to search long and hard within his soul as he's in a hospital bed in deep pain.  And in the end, he said, I don't trust myself enough that I'm not going to come out of this to the other side.  Fine.  And I thought this was just amazing fucking radio.  Then he's taking phone calls from people saying, you know, like, in your case, there's an addict that maybe had the same type of surgery as dental surgery as Rich Voss. 
[01:02:00]  Next thing you know, he's back on fucking pills and the dope.  Well, here's, you know, you can't.  Not meaning to, by the way.  Ronnie said walking around the streets of New York in his everyday life, he knows 99% he could handle it.  He's got it beat.  But in that hospital room, he realized, I can't do this.  I can't find it in myself and trust myself enough.  I'm probably putting some words into his mouth.  But this was the gist of the conversation.  And in the end, he had to say no to pain. 
[01:02:30]  It's a very individual thing.  Yeah.  And it's all just a fine line, too.  But you have done that, Jimmy, and you've been fine with it.  You had a nasal surgery.  When I had my nasal reconstruction, I've taken pain pills for dental.  But the way I take them, I was never a pill guy when I was getting high, is if they say one every four hours, I'll take one every six.  And then I'll start, like, taking halves.  And then I never finish the prescription.  And I know it's only for pain.  And then I throw it out.  But it's very nerve-wracking.  A lot of people do exactly that, but they end up back on the done. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  That's what was great about the show yesterday.  When you get your chin implant.  Is that when you get your chin implant?  I heard you.  See, now, like he said, though, but painkillers.  Like, if the doctor says, you're not a doctor, obviously.  Well, were you offered painkillers?  Yeah, I get offered painkillers all the time.  And why do you say no?  To give to the audience.  That's what I was going to say.  Why did you say no?  Well, no, one time I did, but I didn't need them.  I didn't use, I've had a cabinet full of Vicodins and this and that. 
[01:03:30]  Why do you have them in your cabinet?  So my kid can sell them at school.  You keep them?  See, I dump them, man.  I dump them.  I dump them.  I keep.  Going back to the Ron and Fez show from yesterday.  Do you trust yourself enough to take a few paytos to get through something?  Here's the thing with me, like.  And like Jimmy says, it's an individual thing.  And I find this fascinating.  Yeah, well, like the guy who I used to love a lot, Jim says, that wasn't my drug of choice.  If they were giving me crack as a painkiller. 
[01:04:00]  You'd be in trouble.  I'd be in trouble.  Okay.  But why wouldn't the painkillers lead to crack?  I don't have.  It's motives.  I think part of it is motives.  And again, it's not saying that Ron is wrong for not taking them.  Whatever you feel is the right.  But I know when I'm taking them that I'm really, like when I had sinus surgery, I cannot get through that without painkillers.  Yeah, sure.  I'm not taking them to get high.  I'm taking them because I really don't want my face to feel like I have a fucking knife going through it.  Shit. 
[01:04:30]  And then when I.  But do you feel some kind of like euphoria?  You feel tired more than.  You know what?  Yeah, I remember this feeling.  I like this.  That's right.  I honestly don't feel loopy from them.  I feel tired from them.  Like I would just sleep.  Yeah.  And but again, because of the way I take them and I'm so aware not to take them exactly when you're supposed to, but to make it a longer period.  And you have to be careful of motives.  Like if you start taking them like, you know what?  I hurt more.  Let me take two instead of one.  Then you fucking.  Then you're dope fiending yourself. 
[01:05:00]  If you're extremely aware of what you're doing, that's the logic that a lot of people have when they're in a situation.  Well, if you start melting them down, melting them down and shooting them like you, like I like I know my progression.  I like I stopped gambling for like four years, but then I started playing just to pick six and make a millions.  Right.  You know, so gambling, you know, so now I'm playing pick three again.  And I and I played Texas Hold'em and and.  Oh, no, you did.  It was friendly.  No, you don't understand. 
[01:05:30]  Friendly gambling.  You're a friendly guy.  Oh, shit.  That must have been the punchline because his eyes open wide.  That would be good if somebody just did like fuck you over or you fucked them over and punch your teeth out.  Exactly.  I love that game.  Just wails you in the head.  No, because I'm just sick and tired of being fucking.  I'm sick and tired of being addicted to everything.  You can't.  I can't.  There's nothing.  That'll help an addiction.  Just tell it you're sick of it. 
[01:06:00]  That's how you stop.  I'm sick of being an alcoholic.  Give me that beer.  Jimmy can't even look you in the eyes.  Huh?  You're in trouble.  You're going to start gambling again.  You're in trouble.  No, I didn't start gambling again.  You're going to, is it?  No.  Yes, you will.  Yeah.  No, I've watched you.  You're a fucking slave.  Yeah.  You can't do it.  You're weak.  I just played Hold'em.  You're weak.  No, it was at a golf tournament.  I don't care where it was.  Oh, that makes it better.  How was the gambling on the golf course?  I don't gamble on golf.  Was it friendly gambling on the golf course, too?  It was at the golf course.  I mean, it was at a golf tournament. 
[01:06:30]  Look, you're panicking.  Five hours.  Hold on one second.  Anthony in the Bronx.  Hello.  Yeah, I was listening to Ronald Fez yesterday.  He was saying that he was going to get the nurse in to give him the medicine, and then  he started going through what he put on his iPod playlist to get through the drugs.  The music would just enhance the high, and then he decided, fuck that.  I'm not going to do it.  Yeah, he realized it would be a party no matter what.  What was his band of choice yesterday?  Velvet Underground, I think you said?  Yeah, he said Velvet Revolver, I think, was the first song.  Yeah, I had a drive yesterday, and I listened to the entire show. 
[01:07:00]  It was a great fucking show, man.  Great show yesterday.  He did a great job punching out guys.  Yeah, we know.  No, no, here's the thing, too.  Here's the thing.  If you're in pain, and they give you, say, like Vicodin, or what's another pain killer?  It doesn't matter.  Say they give you a Vicodin, and you take it for the pain, you're not going to get high.  It's just going to decrease the pain.  Now, if you don't have pain, and you take Vicodin, you get high.  Okay?  No, I've taken them for pain and gotten high. 
[01:07:30]  Have you?  Yeah, you probably could feel, yeah, loopy about it, but I don't know.  When you're lucky enough to have a little something-something for pain, you realize the party part of it.  Really?  I don't know.  Yes.  Whenever I've taken a pain killer, you know, maybe three times in 20-something years or whatever.  Like Dan said, you start counting them.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah, you do.  Every second I fucking took one, all I did was pour them all out of my hand, and went one, two, three, for like, how long am I going to have these great things?  Really?  Oh, yes.  How many of us are crazy over Vicodin? 
[01:08:00]  It's like they're the best thing in the world.  They are.  It didn't get me high at all.  Fantastic.  This wasn't for this when I had some other work done.  Yeah.  I don't know what it was.  Lobotomy.  Was it friendly drugging, or was this real drugging, or was this for pain management?  It was pain.  It was pain.  But was it friendly?  You know, people go into recovery.  What did you say?  Friendly gambling?  Friendly.  Yeah, it was friendly.  That's good.  Friendly gambling.  You're in trouble.  Here's what you want to get.  You're in trouble.  Want me to tell you why I'm such a loser gambler real quick?  Yeah.  Okay. 
[01:08:30]  The pick three.  Are you doing pick three?  Well, hold on a couple times, but listen.  You're in trouble.  I played four numbers.  My birthday, 630, which was a famous number here in the studio.  630.  June of 1930.  I don't know.  Oh, oh.  630.  That doesn't work anymore with the 2000.  Well, here's why I'm so bad.  630, 628.  People say 630 AD.  Okay. 
[01:09:00]  630.  Yeah.  628, 903, and 731.  My kid's birthday's and mine.  So I...  Everybody start playing those numbers now.  Well, let me tell you what happened.  So when he does win, the payout is a dollar because a million people are playing.  Listen to me.  Go ahead, Reg.  Sorry.  So I play those four numbers.  628, 630, 731.  Why would you give out your numbers?  It doesn't matter.  What the fuck?  As a goof, people are going to start playing them now.  Well, they can play them now, so there's going to be 12 other people in Jersey playing them.  So...  All right.  When you hit for a million, it's not a million anymore, right? 
[01:09:30]  Pick three is never a million unless you buy a half a million tickets.  I don't know because I'm not a fucking friendly gambler, asshole.  Well, maybe if you listen to the fucking story, okay?  Sorry, sorry, sorry.  I messed up a bigly a hair, so I fucking...  He's saying you have hair like Mike for a bigly a hair.  But it's messed up.  It's messy.  But it's messy.  So 628, 630, 731, and 903.  So I was playing those four numbers 10 times straight a piece.  10 times straight a piece.  And I did it for two weeks.  Oh, my God.  So I did it for two weeks.  Sure, indeed. 
[01:10:00]  It's only two weeks.  And then I said, you know what?  Fuck it.  This is too much money.  It can get me in trouble.  Let me just play.  Let me just play 731, my daughter's birthday, Raina's, not the other kids.  Right.  The day I only played 731, that night 628 came out.  Of course.  No way.  I would have had it 10 times straight.  How much would you have won?  About 3,000.  You're a gambler.  You know the second you don't play it, it's coming in.  If you don't think that's God going, you fucking large-toothed Jew, stop this. 
[01:10:30]  God is telling you to cut the shit.  You couldn't lose worse than you lose gambling.  It's not.  Stop.  I did.  Already, you've been playing for two weeks, you've humiliated yourself.  Stop it.  It's not going to come out again.  What do you think?  Oh, now the kids' birthdays will all start coming out?  Stop gambling.  You're fucking doing good.  Let it go.  It's a funny story. 
[01:11:00]  Why are you slipping?  Stop it.  You can't casually gamble.  Why are you slipping?  I'm not slipping.  You're a fucking...  You're slipping on us.  What's happening?  The actual addiction is the end of a slip.  The slip starts happening long before.  Oh, yeah.  And what you're doing now is you're drinking fucking near beer where someone's smoking pot  and this is just kind of putting your nose in the window from outside for a half a second.  You don't want to get high.  Just smell the...  Stop.  I never liked pot.  Way to get the drifts to the story there. 
[01:11:30]  Jimmy, is this a real thing happening right now with Rich?  Look, I'm not a gambler, but I understand gambling scares me.  So I fucking can't do it.  Like, I play a little video poker.  And I understand how...  Probably.  But I've never had a problem with gambling.  And I never go...  I've never spent more than 300 bucks on a weekend in my life.  It's not a thing for me.  On a girl or on anything.  A girl, I spent over a thousand a day on profits.  Please.  You're talking to the hook of tea. 
[01:12:00]  I mean...  But I know you as a gambler.  Like, the guy who would get to Vegas and two days later be calling people to wire him money  because he had spent all the money he was making for the week.  You were a part of that?  No, I just remember what was happening.  I've known Rich for 20 years.  Rich, boss, we still love you!  Take off on Best Guy Ever. 
[01:12:30]  Look it up on YouTube.  I love that one.  What happened there?  Rich, what'd you just do?  That's really, really disturbing.  What did you just do?  I don't know.  I got some food stuck in my tooth and I try to hit the ceiling.  You hit the food.  Ew, is that my phone?  Rich, you're gambling. 
[01:13:00]  You're gambling, huh?  Yeah.  Not really.  You're gambling.  Not really.  I won't bet on sports or play crap.  Yeah, I won't drink vodka.  Only whiskey.  Oh, shit.  I won't fuck, you know...  No, I stopped again.  I'm only fucking...  I stopped.  It was only for two weeks I was playing.  That's rough.  Because then you're playing Hold'em.  Dude.  Well, no, that was not for money.  That was just...  I don't care if it was for fucking pixie sticks.  That's what we were playing for.  Hold'em is almost...  Hold'em is almost looked at as a sport, though.  Not by this fucking creep.  It's not.  So is fucking shooting dope for some people. 
[01:13:30]  He's fucking can't gamble.  You're mad at him, aren't you?  No, I don't want to see him.  He's got his wife and the baby and it's like...  Hey, Rich.  You're doing good.  What are you doing?  You're slipping.  I remember him gambling.  Although Jimmy says it's past that already.  It was fun to watch.  I mean, he's a psycho.  Was he bad?  Of course.  He's bad as a friend.  He's bad as everything.  I almost got kicked off at crap tables and cursing and yelling.  I don't think he's bad as a...  I don't think he's a bad friend.  No, I just couldn't think of bad things to say.  So I said friend.  He's a bad Jew. 
[01:14:00]  I remember fucking...  Tats.  ...walking around one time in Atlantic City and I sold my necklaces, my gold necklace.  Oh, Jesus.  One time on the crap table, I got so mad and I fucking threw my hand up in the air like  this and right behind me, I didn't see the waitress with her tray.  I had 20 drinks when flying in the air.  She's used to that.  Oh, you are just...  You're that guy.  He's the guy...  Like when I was with Dice, we kind of knew the...  Dice knew the high roller at the Venetian. 
[01:14:30]  This guy spent a lot of money.  So he could get away with...  Like he flipped a table one time, like a fucking poker table.  He'd probably drop $700,000.  Jesus.  Oh, yeah.  You know what I'm not...  I would get angry.  So you can do that.  But when you're losing $1,500 on a craps table, they're not going to tolerate your bunk.  You're a little bullshit.  You're not Redford in decent proposals.  I was in Vegas once.  I was working and I was so hot on the craps table and I'm like, you know, I'm winning  like a couple grand or whatever. 
[01:15:00]  Back then, you know, I'm tipping everybody.  I'm working there for a week.  I'm tipping in the beginning of the week.  I'm a high roller.  By the end of the week, I was eating 19 cent chicken sandwiches at AM, PM gas station.  That's the fucking end of the week in Vegas.  Let me go to Bill in Jersey.  Bill, go ahead.  Rich Voss in studio.  Who's going to be at Governor's?  When?  Tonight and tomorrow.  I'm going to be away.  Fuck.  I'd go see you at Governor's on Long Island.  I might go down, actually.  I haven't been there in a while.  Levittown. 
[01:15:30]  One show tonight.  Two shows tomorrow for Rich Voss at Governor's Comedy Club.  Governors.ning.com?  Where's that?  What the fuck is Ning?  That fucks up the web address, right?  Governors.ning.com.  All right.  Bill in Jersey.  And I what?  Yeah, if he's going to be in Jersey, I can get him a list of some good meetings over the weekend, too.  Because it sounds like he should probably be in one.  Do you think that Rich's gambling is beginning?  Do you think that Rich is telling himself what he wants to hear? 
[01:16:00]  Absolutely.  I absolutely think he's playing around with it, and that's no way to treat it, and it's a very serious addiction.  And it's strange compared to the other addictions, because you're not ingesting anything.  You're not putting anything into your body.  But, you know, I don't have experience with those other addictions.  But from all I know, it's the same effect on the brain.  Were you a gambler?  Oh, absolutely.  What was your bottom, your downfall? 
[01:16:30]  What was my bottom?  I'm almost six years clean, and I was...  How many years clean?  Six, buddy?  I'm coming up on six.  Oh, okay.  Six in October.  And what was your bottom?  Just credit cards, personal loans, huge amounts of money, and huge interest rates.  Well, I didn't care what an interest rate was.  If somebody would give me a loan at 200%, I didn't care. 
[01:17:00]  How fun is blackjack, dude?  Most of my gambling was horses.  Oh, horses.  You ever go to the track?  You ever go to the track?  The sport of kings.  Stand by the rail, right by the fucking wire.  Holy shit, when those horses...  The sound of that fucking thundering horses coming down, you got your ticking hand, fucking  horses in the lead.  Holy shit!  It's great.  Right?  I did that once or twice, yeah. 
[01:17:30]  I was standing right next to Richard Dreyfuss when he won all that money.  Ooh.  It was a Let It Ride reference, but no one got it.  But it was good.  It wasn't good.  It was good.  Listen to me.  Old school references.  That was good.  I don't mind an old school reference, and I tolerated your Marathon Man 2 reference.  Thank you for tolerating it.  Tolerating a joke.  But when it comes, I just, you know, I don't know. 
[01:18:00]  How does your asshole have stretch marks?  He just all opened his asshole up and farted.  I actually answered him literally.  He did a fucking ass joke, and I answered him for real.  Yeah, man.  It's rough, dude.  You're crazy.  I need the air conditioners to blow the fart away.  I don't even, gambling scares me.  I'll play those video poker, and like sometimes if I win 50 bucks or whatever, I just stop.  Go upstairs. 
[01:18:30]  I can't do it.  It scares me to fucking.  Rich has got it under control.  Right, Rich?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's friendly.  I took enough time off.  That's what the addiction's about.  Smiling while you're doing it.  Friends.  I've took enough time off.  Yeah, you're fine.  I took a vacation from gambling.  Please don't gamble.  I'm not gonna.  I mean, why?  Please don't do it.  How do you watch a foot?  Like, I can't watch football, because there's no reason,  unless you're, I mean, that's why I'm gonna stop.  I'm not, I'm not doing it anymore.  Yeah, you can't fuck football.  You can't watch football without gambling.  Without gambling?  Why not?  Well, what? 
[01:19:00]  I never gambled about football in my life.  If you've got a team, do you have an actual team you like?  No.  You never had a team you liked?  I did back when I was young.  I liked the Rams, because I played on them in Little League.  The Rams.  I played on them.  Yeah.  How about this?  Make a friendly bet with yourself.  Like, when you watch football, go, hey, if that team wins, I'll tell everybody I like  sucking cock.  If they don't win, I'll just keep it to myself.  Okay, win.  Rich, what else is going on with you?  We'll move on from your friendly gambling. 
[01:19:30]  Well, what's going on with me?  Yeah, what else is up?  You're here.  A fucking lot of stuff is up.  You're queer.  You're fabulous.  We're used to it.  Thanks, Anthony.  Personally in life?  Oh, yeah.  How's Bonnie?  Oh, we had sex last night.  Oh, how is she now?  Probably still bored.  No, last night was good.  Like, we went over to the distress factory.  We were watching Andy Kimmel.  You know, he is fucking funny.  Yeah, he is.  Holy fuck.  I mean, I know he is, but we're...  Anyhow, so...  Did he sell well? 
[01:20:00]  Because he's on Les Comic now.  It's good to see him on the show.  Yeah, but he only had a curtain off right behind the third row.  He's fucking funny.  Funny.  Yeah.  But doesn't sell tickets.  You had to do it to the guy.  Yeah.  I had to do what to him?  Well, last night was a...  Tell him the world that he doesn't sell tickets.  I didn't tell the world.  I didn't say anything.  It was the curtain joke at Caroline's.  That's a joke.  Yeah.  And it doesn't matter.  You guys get very happy when other comics have to have the curtain pulled. 
[01:20:30]  I heard you.  I could just put it right in front of me on a Thursday or a Sunday.  For the people that I don't know, hold on.  Caroline's has this big fucking black curtain, and if you don't sell well, to make the room  look good, they just pull that curtain open.  And just cut off half the seats in the place.  And these fuckers love when a comedian doesn't sell well.  Oh, they love watching that curtain close.  Yes.  These guys wouldn't let me on the air in, I think it was in San Francisco or when I was  out in Pleasanton, because they had... 
[01:21:00]  They go, no, we don't...  Something with Opie and Anthony.  Who is Lamont and Tinelli?  Oh, fuck those assholes.  They wouldn't let me on the air.  Is there something...  Did I smash these guys ever?  They blatantly ripped off our Whipping My Wednesday campaign, so we called them on it,  and now they have...  I don't know.  Where are they out of?  I don't even know, to be honest with you.  Somewhere out west.  Can you look up Lamont and Tinelli?  Look, they blatantly ripped off the one thing that we hate that people rip off.  Yeah. 
[01:21:30]  So, I was doing a club and...  And we called them on it.  Oh, wait.  Here's Sam.  Sam will tell you all.  Oh, Sam's running.  Sam.  Hi, Sam.  Is that correct, sir?  I didn't hear what you said right before I came in.  Lamont and Tinelli, what do you know about them?  We destroyed them on Jocktober.  Oh, they're...  Ah.  And they ripped off our WoW thing, right?  Yeah, I think they're the ones who ripped off the WoW thing.  Blatantly, too.  They didn't even change it to some weird...  Yeah, we tore them apart during, I think, this year, or the 2009...  Did we poke fun at them? 
[01:22:00]  Very much so.  Poke fun at them.  Yes.  We don't even remember anymore.  What was the big thing we did with those guys?  I think...  Oh, look at that.  One of them's a black guy.  I would go with Lamont as a black guy.  What the fuck?  Why wouldn't they let me on?  This is only like...  You might have been in studio that day, Rich.  You might have been trashing them.  No, I was in studio with...  How do you know?  I remember who I was in studio with when you did somebody in Portland. 
[01:22:30]  You did a guy in...  Okay.  Hey, man.  Jacktober's coming up.  I know.  Lamont and Tinelli may be revisited for the 2010 Jacktober.  Start sending your suggestions for Rocktober to Sam.  Jocktober.  You said Rocktober.  Yeah, Jocktober.  Jocktober.  You're right.  I want to see Lamont and Tinelli.  Yeah, that's Sam.  Wait, which one is which?  Oh, well.  Oh, yeah.  I remember the white guy.  The black guy.  The fucking black guy's...  The black guy looks retarded.  Yeah, that's what you said last.  The one guy... 
[01:23:00]  Okay.  Why does that one guy look like Big Kev?  The guy in the middle?  Yeah, a thin version of Big Kev.  The girl's pretty.  Yeah, she's all right.  Yeah, they were horribly ridiculed on this show.  Oh, really?  We poked a little...  Oh, they're nuts, though.  Those guys are crazy.  Look at them giving the Negro a noogie.  A Negri.  A Negro to the black man, which means his knuckles are going to be all sore.  It's unbelievable.  I mean, I had nothing.  There's no reason to keep me out of the studio.  Shut up.  Fuck that.  They did you a favor.  No one cares about their show. 
[01:23:30]  They did you a favor.  Did you sell well out there?  Yeah, it was all right.  All right.  Fuck that.  Look at the guy in this Hawaiian shirt.  That's crazy.  No, because he is.  Because he's nuts.  What?  That's a good picture.  I think you three should do it.  Oh, yeah.  Put it in the middle like that.  And rub his head?  No, put your cocks in his ear.  I don't fucking know.  Neither Lamont or Tinelli are the black guy, by the way.  That's right.  The black guy.  He has some weird name, I think.  We can guess.  In person, in person, in person, in person, in person. 
[01:24:00]  I have a sneaky suspect, and we know where it is.  What do you call the black guy in the middle?  In person.  Perp.  Looks like the three guys, everybody starts yelling, which of these things is not like  the other ones.  Thanks, Sam.  That's Chip.  Thanks for your phone, Sam.  Angry Chip face.  I don't know where your sandwich is.  I can't wait to...  Wait, what did he just do? 
[01:24:30]  Because he wants a sandwich.  I hope it's a crushed glass on the right.  He just turned around and said, hey, where the fuck is my sandwich?  I don't know where your sandwich is.  Why would he know where your sandwich is?  I don't know.  I thought he ran the intern.  I'll find out.  I'll find out.  Where the fuck is my sandwich?  Goddamn, Rich.  Oh, no.  Rich has opened up his asshole and farted back.  At Jimmy.  Rich pulled his pants down, opened up his asshole and just blasted a fart at Jimmy.  Yeah, some poker chips fell out. 
[01:25:00]  Jesus, 53.  Yeah, you guys are awful.  You're 53.  Yeah.  What do you think of Tiger at the Barclays?  You're a big golf guy.  You know what?  What bothers me about is these fucking hack writers.  Everybody's such a...  All the golf writers and sports announcers.  No, even if he doesn't win a tournament, he gets a main headline.  Because he's the only...  I'll tell you what.  Okay, let's hear.  He's the only exciting... 
[01:25:30]  No one...  Golf is a very specific sport, like soccer in this country.  It's like most people don't give a fuck about golfers.  You're 100% wrong.  You don't give a fuck.  No, I'm not.  No, you are wrong.  I said most people...  You don't know how many people play...  You're wrong.  You're wrong.  Don't give a fuck about Fuzzy Zeller or Vijay Zeller.  Sorry.  That's just funny for golfers.  Whatever these fucking people are.  Tiger...  Fuzzy hasn't been around in a while, Jimmy.  I'm just saying, Tiger is the one...  Proving your point, I guess.  Meaning, I don't watch basketball. 
[01:26:00]  I very rarely watch it, but I knew all about LeBron and what was going on.  I don't watch fucking...  Even football, I've lost interest in.  Baseball, but I know a lot about it just because everybody is talking about it.  It's common.  People are talking about it.  No one gives a fuck about most golfers.  They're boring guys.  Probably.  They don't give a fuck about golfers, but they care about golfers.  They watch...  Golfers have been going for fucking ever.  I understand that, but I'm telling you, most people...  Tiger is by far the most interesting thing in the sport. 
[01:26:30]  Of course.  They may...  Yeah.  He's the most interesting thing.  But, as a good writer, if he doesn't win a tournament, you don't put Tiger takes third.  A good writer will fucking, you know...  If you have arguably the greatest ever, he may or may not be, he's the guy that everybody  is following.  It's almost like when Jordan...  It's not true.  He's not the guy everybody's following.  He's the guy the Tiger fans follow.  So when Jordan...  No.  Because I'm not a fan of golf, but I'm interested in how he does it. 
[01:27:00]  It's almost like Jordan with basketball.  The headline was always, you know, the Bulls lost last night to the fucking Nets, but Jordan  had 48.  Or the Bulls, you know, Jordan's team has lost, even if it was because Pippen missed eight  free throws.  Didn't matter.  Like, that's the focus.  It's for really people who are on the fence about golf or non-golf fans to read it.  Well...  Maybe that's wrong as a purist, but...  It's sort of wrong, because Tiger is still the number one golfer in the world, even though  he's had a horrendous year. 
[01:27:30]  So, I mean, that's one reason why you should still get a lot of Tiger coverage when you're  watching these golf tournaments.  He still is the number one guy.  Yeah, but there is golfers that follow in the sport that you want to watch that they won't  even cover, you know, because if he's a...  I mean...  They cover everybody.  They really do.  They don't.  I mean, when Daly's out there, you want to watch Daly fucking have a meltdown.  Yeah, but if Daly's plus 18 after four holes, really, they're going to keep showing  them?  No, but I mean, there's guys...  They've got to figure it out. 
[01:28:00]  They're going to show Tiger no matter what, because it was a huge story this year, and  he's still the number one golfer in the world.  And then you're going to show the guys that are in the running for the tournament, and  then for a goof, every once in a while, you show Tom Watson.  For a goof.  Yeah.  And that's how it works.  And everybody else, you've got to play a little better, and they'll show it.  Well, some of them play great.  And if Daly wraps his fucking club around a spectator, they'll show the replay.  Right?  Greg Norman.  He's missing by probably 10 years. 
[01:28:30]  10 years about.  Don't know.  Which is fine.  You know, it's not your thing.  That's my real golf knowledge.  In your world, golf is nothing.  Yeah, but...  And the people you hang out with.  It's a big...  I understand that, but I'm talking about most regular people walking around don't give  a fuck about any golf personalities, really, other than Tiger.  He's the only interesting guy in the whole sport.  And most regular people didn't give a fuck about OJ, but they were glued to TV.  Those people are fucking idiots.  There's a difference.  OJ's a good example of Tiger, though.  Payne Stewart. 
[01:29:00]  Payne Stewart.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No one cares about Payne Stewart.  Bagger Vance.  Never heard of him.  Oh, God.  Have you ever heard of Bagger Vance?  No, I haven't.  Are you fucking kidding me?  No, it sounds like you're encouraging Vance.  Oh, Jesus.  To go off and get the girl.  Bagger Vance.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:29:30]  All right.  Sounds like you're almost...  I almost thought you were talking about my black friend, Vance.  You said it twice.  In person.  Will Smith, was that a movie?  Yeah.  Rich, you all right?  I'm...  Yeah, this is...  I haven't been here in a while.  It's been a while.  Fucking how good was Colin's fucking show?  It was great.  Oh, you saw the one-man show?  Yeah.  Everyone should be seeing that.  It's been extended.  Good for him.  It's on, I think, Bleecker Street, 45, the theater's called or something, and it's called  Long Story Short, and it was really fucking good, man. 
[01:30:00]  Really funny.  That's going to end up on HBO or Showtime.  It has to.  If that doesn't end up on TV...  He's still behind it.  It's definitely going to be on TV eventually.  You want to meet Oscar, Rich?  It's his last day.  Who?  Yeah.  Oscar.  You got to meet Oscar.  If he's bringing my fucking sandwich, I'd like to meet him.  He just might, actually.  He's bringing my fucking sandwich.  What does Oscar do?  He brings sandwiches, so...  Is he an intern?  Yeah.  He's his last day.  He's a sandwich bringer.  Can we get Oscar in here?  Is he out there?  This is Oscar.  Oh, here. 
[01:30:30]  Look at him.  What?  Enjoy Oscar.  It's his last day.  Oscar.  Good morning.  How you doing, man?  All right.  Where are you going from here?  To stretch hats?  Oscar, another tight shirt.  He does have a big head.  That shirt is so tight.  Look at the buttons.  You should be on a mountain next to President.  You think so?  No.  What was wrong with that one?  Oh, you got to follow up a good hat stretching joke with Mount Rushmore.  You wanted to make it clever. 
[01:31:00]  It was funny when you would just mean, what are you going to do, stretch hats?  Fat head.  Right?  Fat head.  You do have a huge head, Oscar.  And tight shirt.  Yeah, I get that a lot.  People are like, if we're passenger side and people are backing out of the driveway,  it's like, damn, Oscar, you have a huge head.  I get that a lot.  Okay.  Awesome.  Where are you from?  Morristown, New Jersey.  No, before that, when you came over.  Columbia.  Columbia.  That's right.  You don't fuck with the Columbians, man.  They blow up fucking city blocks. 
[01:31:30]  Now that you're gambling again, you might want to talk to Oscar after the show for the  other addiction that you're probably going to get back into soon.  Oh, no, I can't.  Oscar might be able to help you out, Rich.  I have too much to lose with that.  You might be able to help you out.  Columbia?  Yeah, sir.  And are you going back?  Well, I go there and visit sometimes.  Who do you visit?  Oh, family.  Yeah?  I still have a family on there.  Watch them hang someone out of a helicopter.  No, I just go there for the girls.  Oscar's okay.  You go there for the girls?  Yeah.  Just like putting them to the girls.  You know, you just take them out. 
[01:32:00]  Beer's cheap.  You just bring them some jeans from here.  No, I don't actually bring them.  No, I don't take anything back.  Are they all chewing coca leaves?  No, no.  No?  No, but I mean, if you're like at a little bar and you talk to somebody, hey, you think  you can get me some stuff?  You know, like $4 takes you all the way.  How much?  $4.  $4 takes you, what, gets you pussy?  No, well.  Coke?  Yeah.  How much Coke can you get for $4 in Columbia?  Plenty.  No fucking way. 
[01:32:30]  Like how much?  Fucking God.  It's hard to say.  No, I wouldn't know, but I know.  I'm just asking.  Because you go down there.  How much can you get for $4?  About this much.  Like an eight ball?  No.  No more.  For $4?  More than an eight ball for $4?  Why did I quit?  I can't believe I'm saying this.  Why?  Wait, no one knows Columbia has Coke, you dummy?  No, no, I'm just saying.  So, you know, all you have to do is get that $4 Coke into America and you can make some money.  That's what they call the drug trade.  I know.  That's the whole game. 
[01:33:00]  I know.  Buy low, sell high.  I know.  Don't get arrested in between.  But if you're a local, it means nothing.  You're not making money off it.  No, you can't go down the street in Columbia and just sell it for more money.  Right.  No, yeah, it's just...  Pablo Escobar.  Yeah.  It's like cockroaches down there.  Yeah.  It's just everywhere, right?  Mm-hmm.  And you saw, you said yesterday, you saw Pablo Escobar at like soccer games and shit?  Yeah, something like that was really...  Yeah.  What would they...  What would like a bunch of people be like, hey, wave to him and shit? 
[01:33:30]  How did you know he was there?  No, he had his posse or something, whatever.  Posse?  Why are you...  Why is Oscar calm today?  This is really weird.  Yeah.  No, I'm a little tired.  I was just...  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Were you out drinking last night?  Oh, yeah.  I had about 12, so yeah.  You had about 12 what?  Yeah, 12 beers.  12 beers?  Yeah, yeah.  No, I was out...  And then you drove home?  No, no.  I guess I was like two blocks from my house.  So then you drove home?  No, no.  I walked.  No, actually, somebody drove me there.  That's right.  Now I remember.  Here we go.  All right, now he's going.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's enjoy this kid. 
[01:34:00]  So you drank like 12 beers at a bar.  No, no.  It was my cousin's birthday.  Cousin's birthday?  Yeah, he was turning 16, so yeah.  I gave him a punching bag for his birthday.  It was used, though.  What's her name?  I was leaning into the microphone.  Columbians beat their women.  Yes, they do.  That's a sign of affection.  He looks like he has that retarded strength.  Without the strength part.  What?  No, I'm not retarded for the record.  Not for the record. 
[01:34:30]  Are you strong?  A little.  What can you bank?  I don't know.  I used to do like 181.  Can you not ask 181?  181.  My three-year-old's doing that.  Yeah, she sure is.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  So why?  You're a hard guy to knock out.  You've got a big head.  You're probably a hard guy to knock out.  Yeah, I bet he's got a steal.  Can you take a punch?  I think so.  When was the last time you had any fit?  It's probably like fifth grade and stuff like that.  Nothing too recent.  Fifth grade, so you were 20.  I try to avoid conflict. 
[01:35:00]  See, Rich, leave it alone.  It's very funny.  I'm glad my coach is here.  Wet me down now.  Good eye.  Good eye, Rich.  So where are you going from here?  I start school next week.  No, I mean, right?  Oh, I'm going to TGF Riders to get beard later.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't like hungover.  I don't like hungover Oscar.  Hungover Oscar sucks.  Why?  But he's hungover every day.  No, well.  He is a little calm today. 
[01:35:30]  No, I don't get hungover anymore.  It's just I get tired of not getting sleep.  So you're a 16-year-old cousin.  Yeah, yeah.  And you're drinking with your 16-year-old cousin, right?  There was a couple friends there, family, and we just had a cake.  We had pizza.  I want to get the menu.  So you brought some beers over and shared them with your cousin on his birthday?  No, I drank them all myself.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  There he is.  Why didn't you give your cousin any beer?  No, because his mom was there, and then she starts screaming at me.  But, you know, I don't persuade that kind of thing. 
[01:36:00]  Who was his mom or your mom?  Both.  Actually, my mom and his mom.  Oh, you live at home?  Yeah, I still live at home.  His mom?  Oh, your cousin?  Yeah.  Yeah, you live at home?  Yeah, yeah.  Actually, like all my family, we live on the same block.  Yeah, who has the nicest cardboard?  What's up?  I missed it.  Step out of the batter's box, Rich.  He's implied here.  Step out.  That's another good one.  Wait for another good pitch.  Where's my mouth guard? 
[01:36:30]  Hanging below my belt.  Next to your stomach.  I got nothing.  But why?  Oh, that one was a swing to miss.  Be more funny.  Oh, wow, man.  Uh-oh.  We're going to be playing Pyramid today.  You want to pick Oscar as your partner, Rich, or you want Bobo?  I'll take Oscar any day over Bobo.  Awesome.  So Bob Kelly gets Bobo for it.  Bobo's an idiot to bond.  Oh, yeah? 
[01:37:00]  Oh, awesome.  Thank you.  Oh, he's getting them.  Alex, look at Sam.  What the fuck is my sandwich?  Gave him some caffeine drink.  We're talking to the sandwich guy.  After we're done with Oscar, he'll get your sandwich.  That's how it works.  Oscar, you take your time.  Okay, cool.  Enjoy your time on the air, your last day.  So is it like prep or something on the game, or what are we supposed to do?  No, there's no prepping.  Go give your little brother his shirt back.  Okay.  No, it's not that tight, though.  It's not that tight?  No.  It looks like it's almost a blouse.  It looks like a high water.  No, maybe it's just because of the... 
[01:37:30]  No, look at that top button.  It's pushing.  It's got like wrinkles around it from where it's stressed and strained.  When we first met you, you were working out.  What happened with that?  Yeah, no, I'm still working out just because I was doing the diet first, but then I'm not doing  the diet.  No, get out.  He does his Barney Rubble laugh and that's it.  Yeah, no.  I've just been drinking a lot of beer lately.  I mean, I know.  Yeah?  Yeah, that kind of throws a hole.  Why?  What are you stressed?  You need a little few beers? 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  No, yeah.  I need a little chill out.  What do you drink?  You like the taste of beer or you like getting drunk?  No, both.  Both.  I like both.  That's right.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  You want Bobo?  Look at him.  Awesome, yeah.  What?  It's just his profile.  Oh, I know.  It's fantastic.  It's horrible.  It looks like a keg is drinking a beer already.  It's like that.  Awesome, yeah.  Oh, so what's the game plan?  What's the game plan?  He gets all nervous.  Okay, we're going to put it in your ass. 
[01:38:30]  No, no, no.  No, thanks.  No, I pass on that.  He's polite about refusing rape.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not into that kind of stuff.  No, no, no.  Have you ever had a little man-to-man?  No, no.  Hell no.  Never in Columbia?  Hell no, man.  Hell no.  I don't speak that way.  For drugs?  A little desperate?  There's a little coke on the table?  I have a story.  Check it out, man.  I have a couple weeks.  Sorry.  This story is great.  What happened was a couple friends went out drinking, right?  So it was like 4 or 5 in the morning. 
[01:39:00]  They were looking for hookers.  Cool.  Yeah, and they found some transvestite, and I had to do that one morning.  But I wasn't with them.  It's just they told me about it the following day.  What did they do with the transvestite?  Oh, they had anal.  Yeah, I know.  Exactly.  Even Jim is giving you a look.  So your friends fucked a man in the ass.  Yeah, yeah, pretty much.  Oh, I was like, God fucked in the ass.  That's fine.  No, the worst part is when you have a friend for like over 10 years, and he asks you to 
[01:39:30]  fix a computer, and then he brings a computer over, and it turns out like his browser, like  his history, it's all like she-mails and all that, like, yeah.  I didn't know we were friends.  Oh, no.  Oh, no, I'm just talking about, like, I was focusing on a friend's computer.  A literal Oscar.  Oh, no.  Doesn't he know to erase his history?  What did I miss?  What kind of dub he does is empty his cache or browser history before giving his computer?  No, no, no.  It has nothing to do with money.  The guy's not nothing.  He was, he's not good with computers. 
[01:40:00]  That's why, you know, he asked me to help him.  Obviously not, but I've never met anybody that bad.  Like, you don't have to be a computer-wise.  He doesn't know how to get rid of your history.  What's his name?  Exactly.  Oh, no, I can't.  So what did you say to him about the she-mail stuff?  No, I just ignored it, and then I told my friends on Monday when I got back to school,  and I guess I don't know how to feel about it.  I was like, fuck, I know this guy 10 years, and all of a sudden, he's into all this  kind of stuff.  Yeah, what sites?  I don't remember.  I know it was she-mail.com.  That's the one I recall.  Was he, uh...  Is that legit?  I mean, yeah.  Did he jerk off the tranny while he fucked it in the ass? 
[01:40:30]  I don't know.  No, but then one time.  All right.  Oh, okay.  All right, cool.  Another story.  We were out.  It was like five in the morning, so we need to go get more stuff.  Sure.  So we were out, and then he started mentioning these things, but that was way, way years before  the whole computer incident.  So I was sitting there.  Well, he went inside the house, and then he started telling me,  yo, and he started asking me, hey, you ever let another guy suck your dick or something?  And I said, no, I don't think so.  I said, but he started talking about transvestites.  And then he came, and then, so we went in there for an hour. 
[01:41:00]  So he finally got back with the stuff, and apparently, I think the dealer was also into  that kind of stuff, like sex, man-on-man.  Close day.  So you think your friend sucked the guy's dick?  Yeah, yeah.  Sucked his cuck?  And he came back with a little bottle.  It was called Blue Boy.  That stuff was ridiculous, man.  What is it?  What's that?  I think it was like horse tranquilizer, like animal, what do they call it?  Animal tranquilizer?  Horse tranquilizer.  Yeah, horse tranquilizer. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  So what happened, you take like a sniff out of that, and then you go like that, and  then for like 20 seconds.  Oh, sniffing poppers?  Oh, boy.  I don't know what that is.  I don't know if that's it.  Oh, yeah.  Amyl nitrate.  Yeah.  No, no, but it's not.  What does it do, bro?  Oh, no, for 20 seconds, you just go on like, your brain goes blank, all you hear is your  heartbeat, and then just, yeah, that's all you hear.  Tell us about the rabbits.  What rabbits?  Hold on, hold on.  All right, you hear the heartbeat, then what?  Yeah, yeah, and then for 20 seconds, you just go like blank, like dumb.  Like you can't respond to anything for 20 seconds.  And you never snapped out of it?  Yeah. 
[01:42:00]  What are poppers?  Like, have you ever done poppers?  When I was, we just, I sniffed like, yeah, but I was even.  Gay guys use it to loosen up their assholes before anal.  No, why?  How does that loosen up your assholes?  I don't know.  Seriously?  I don't know.  Yeah, they like do anal nitrate poppers.  Wait, they, and that, like when you, I don't know what's to get you high or something.  Yeah, it doesn't make you have a rush.  It's really bad.  Huh?  Loosen up your asshole.  I mean, the whole time I'm using this fucking jelly and I can just do it through my nose now? 
[01:42:30]  So it wasn't a horse tranquilizer?  No, it was an animal tranquilizer or something on it in the back.  It was like a little container.  You don't drink it, though?  No, no, it's sniffing.  So you're huffing?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Anyways.  I think you have a problem with alcohol.  Oh, yeah, he's definitely got an alcohol problem.  He just realized he brought it up.  That's coming from me.  He goes, why did I talk about that?  And Sam had to remind him he brought it up.  Oh, yeah.  We're going to miss you, Oscar.  We have a bad short-term memory. 
[01:43:00]  Do you?  Yeah, but long-term is pretty good, actually.  I can remember, like, shit from back in the day.  Where are you going from here, Oscar?  What do you mean today?  Yes, in ten minutes.  In ten minutes.  The best thing to do with Oscar is simple.  What are you thinking right now?  Right now?  No, I'm thinking about the question.  I mean, ten minutes.  I'm sure I'll still be here if I don't get kicked out.  That would assume that this is going well.  Yeah, cool.  Awesome, awesome. 
[01:43:30]  I was going to say, I mean, just to answer your question, I guess from here,  I'm going to go grab a couple beers with Joe Cox.  Of course, that's his name.  Who's Joe Cox?  Oh, he's the other intern now.  He's been our intern for, like, the whole semester.  What's his real last name?  It's COX.  Oh, I thought maybe it was just the nickname he gave him.  Joe Cox.  Yeah, so we're going to have a couple beers.  So you got a couple beers with another man? 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, no, we're just going to chill out.  How long did your friend suck your dick for, for real?  No, no.  No, I swear to God, like, no.  Did he just pop it in his mouth and hold it there?  No, no, no, no.  No, no, I didn't do it.  No, I didn't.  No, I'm straight, dude.  Like, for real?  It's not gay if you let him do it.  It's not gay if he doesn't move up and down, if he just holds it in his mouth and allows  his tongue to swab it.  Oh, wow.  Swab it.  Just run slow circles around it.  It's not gay if you don't lean your head back.  Oh.  Yeah.  Shut your eyes and moan.  No, I'd rather pay for a prostitute before, like, I get my, you know, I get, like, the 
[01:44:30]  ending is all the same.  It's exactly, you know, it's all the same.  One time she's spitting and the next time you are.  What's the difference?  Yeah, we're going to play Pyramid with you.  Cool.  You ever watch the game, $25,000 Pyramid?  No, no.  You've never seen it?  No, I don't think so.  Dick Clark is the host.  Oh, no.  You've got to sit down.  You give clues.  Oh, no, no.  For a second, I thought I had it.  They didn't have that in Columbia? 
[01:45:00]  No, no.  $25,000.  No, they have $25,000.  No.  You saved yourself.  I didn't save myself.  Hey, are we ready to play Pyramid?  No.  Is Bob Kelly here?  You need Bobby here.  Yeah, he's.  So are we ready for after the break?  He just signed in.  He just signed in.  Okay.  So after the break, we can do this?  Get it over with?  All right.  So Rich, get it over with.  We're going to sell it.  I mean, in the show before a vacation.  Rich, you're going to take Oscar as your partner for Pyramid?  Yeah.  And you're playing against Bob Kelly and Bobo.  All right, but I'm not taking him to the Governor's this weekend. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, shit.  Governor's Comedy Club.  Rich Voss.  We have two hours.  Tonight and tomorrow.  Two hours, obviously.  Of what?  So my Foxwood tickets go on sale this morning, 10 a.m. for October 14, 15, 16.  Foxwood's Casino, new comedy club there.  Oh, yeah.  So in two hours, tickets go on sale.  And later this morning, Ira stops by.  Have you met Ira, Rich?  No, that's my middle name.  Is it really?  Yeah.  Oh, I can't be friends with that.  You should open a website, worstfacts.com. 
[01:46:00]  He has nice knees.  Thank you.  Thank you.  He hates being touched, but he doesn't mind me rubbing his knee.  Oh, because unlike yours, there's no scabs on him.  All right.  Stop.  Stop.  Walk out.  Walk out.  Step back.  Step back.  Walk off Homer.  That's what being a guy is.  No woman would ever just look at a friend's knees and make a lesbian pussy-eating joke.  Like, you've been nearly eating cunt. 
[01:46:30]  That's why we hate them.  That's why our movie's going to do so well.  Oh, God damn.  All right.  We'll take a break.  We're going to play Pyramid with all these guys next.  Yes.  Stay there.  The OPNX Show on the virus.  This is XM.  I realize you're mine.  And we are more than mine.  I realize you're mine. 
[01:47:00]  And we are more than mine.  I.  Bob Kelly in studio.  Rich Voss's studio playing Governors tonight and tomorrow night out there on Long Island.  Going to play a little Pyramid with these guys.  And Bob Kelly already causing problems.  You don't like your partner?  Oh, my fucking partner's retarded. 
[01:47:30]  Like, officially.  Like, medically.  Medically.  You should flip a coin for partners.  I should get an affair, Rich.  What's that?  I should be able to get the affair.  Is that a retard?  No, I don't care.  You know.  So, you want to flip?  Then let me have you.  You don't care?  You don't care?  Let me have him, then.  Let me have the other guy.  What, you and Oscar?  Yeah.  Well, you guys kind of look alike.  So, yeah.  I can have him.  I know whatever you want, Bobby.  I like you, so whatever you want.  Anything that'll make you happy makes me happy. 
[01:48:00]  What do you want?  I don't want anything.  Why are you being nice?  Because I'm a new person.  I turn over a new leaf.  Because you turn into fucking a yenter as you get older.  Because I just want to be nice.  He's got new teeth, Bobby.  He's got fantastic teeth.  Compliment him.  It's been 10 years coming.  Isn't that amazing?  Yeah, look at that.  Fucking disgusting.  He still does the same disgusting shit with his new teeth he did with his old teeth.  What's that?  You just dug your little midget finger into the back of your teeth and dug food out.  No, I got to put the water out. 
[01:48:30]  The food out.  Oh, don't do that.  Dude, it's called floss.  You don't use your finger, you fucking cowboy.  No, it's between my fucking lip and here.  You don't floss up here.  But you do that somewhere else, not in mid-conversation.  You don't jam your finger in your mouth and mush food from the back to the front along your teeth.  Really?  It was kind of gross.  Did I disrespect food?  Yeah.  That is rough, though.  When you're digging into your own mouth.  That is rough. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, you did.  You did.  I'm here to defend food.  That was a fucking dickhead.  That is a good one.  That was a fucking great one.  Fucking rich.  When it's good, it's good.  You got to give it to him.  Step out.  Wow, that was brutal.  Nice.  What happened?  What did I miss?  Oh, a lot of good stuff.  What did I miss?  Just terrific stuff.  Fucking awesome.  What did I miss?  So fun.  I hate missing stuff. 
[01:49:30]  Some kids are a fucking good time.  Rich sucked.  Good time.  Oh, my God.  What did I miss?  I hate missing stuff again.  Wow.  What did I miss?  What's wrong, Rich?  Starbucks is strong.  It really is.  You need vodka in it?  No.  That would make it stronger.  You need some friendly coffee today?  Friendly.  You want some friendly coffee?  Too strong for you?  I hate Starbucks.  Fucking Dunkin' Donuts is the place, man.  Starbucks is so overrated with their stupid fucking coffee.  I'd love a cup of coffee.  It used to be way ahead of the game. 
[01:50:00]  Not anymore.  So let's play Pyramid.  I could use some coffee, Bobby.  Build a chill.  Can you use some coffee?  Yeah, I'd love some coffee.  Round of coffee for the boys.  Thanks, Hope.  Here comes Bobo.  Here comes Oscar.  Ah, good old sandal Bobo.  So this is, so you're doing $25,000.  You guys got callers involved that get prizes, too? 
[01:50:30]  Or, like, I mean, this is a prize for the winners?  Do we get a...  Oh, look at Rich.  Want some action on the game.  Rich wants some action on the game.  Look at him.  You heard it, Jimmy.  Yeah, he doesn't care about the winners.  You hear how excited he got?  He's fucking degenerate.  By the way, Oscar opened the door and slammed Bobo in the back with the knob of the door.  It was great.  How are you, Bobo?  And Bobo didn't even notice.  I'm doing all right.  You don't seem very friendly this morning.  What's wrong, Bobo?  You trying to fight for your position back on the show?  You didn't say hi outside. 
[01:51:00]  You didn't seem very happy to say hi.  Yeah, what's the matter?  What's on your lip?  That looked like you were busy.  What's on your lip right here?  Is that a sore?  Herpes?  Uh-oh.  No, no, no.  I think that baby is...  That's Down syndrome.  Van cock-goggling last week?  No, I don't know.  Huh?  Is it from your brother's dick?  No, no.  It might have been something I just cut myself.  That's all.  You cut yourself?  Cut yourself what?  How?  Are you a cutter?  No.  No.  What's wrong, Bobo?  Is it a shanker?  No, everything's all right.  What's wrong?  What's the matter, Bobo?  What's wrong?  Tell us what's the matter. 
[01:51:30]  No, everything's all right.  It's just the whole week my mother was out of town and I just cleaned up a lot of bullshit.  Where was that bitch?  She was in upstate.  She was in upstate for whatever reason.  You're upset because you had to clean up dog shit?  These dogs get unpredictable.  One of them's predictable, but ever since we got...  Oh, yeah.  You feed them, they shit.  Very unpredictable.  The second dog that we have, we got two of them now.  Yeah.  They get very unpredictable.  What do you mean by unpredictable?  All of a sudden, it grabbed the car keys and went for a ride? 
[01:52:00]  No, it's like...  It beat you a chest.  It's all possible.  You never know when you got to clean up.  Now, that would be unpredictable.  Exactly.  When you got to clean up after them and one of them can sneak a little shit on the kitchen  floor.  They start speaking German?  They start sneaking a shit on the kitchen floor.  So your house now smells like shit.  No, I spent a lot of time cleaning it almost every time I find a pile of...  Yeah.  I can't find a pile of it.  What did Bobo bring in?  Nothing.  Not usual.  Me and my mother got some stuff for you, for your son. 
[01:52:30]  Oh.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Now what?  He's nicer than your co-workers.  He was flying around in my house.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  I was flying around the last minute when I was going to be here.  That's so nice.  What is it, Bobo?  I don't read cards.  You got to read the cards.  Read the cards.  I don't read cards.  Read the cards.  Read the cards.  Read the cards.  Read the cards.  I don't read cards.  Read the cards.  Just read the cards.  Read the cards.  Read the cards. 
[01:53:00]  Yes, you do.  Read the cards.  Read it.  Read it.  Oh, he just threw it in the garbage.  He just threw it in the garbage.  Read the card.  He's a Phillies fan.  Just read the card.  I lost that already.  It's a Mets bib.  You lost that battle, huh?  What was it, Bobo?  All right, Bobo.  Are you sad?  Don't be sad.  I'll clean off the coffee and it'll be a nice gift.  What was it?  Oh, no.  What is that?  You got me a gift, Bobo.  Wait, what is this?  What is this for?  That's a card.  Why am I getting something? 
[01:53:30]  What's the card say?  Actually, open it up first.  He was just going to tell me.  No, no, before you open that up, can I step out of the room?  Me and Vos are going to just step out a second.  Why?  Why?  Can you see if it's ticking?  What the fuck is it wrapped in?  What the fuck?  Oh, it's cheesecloth.  That's a nice piece of wood that you gave Anthony.  Actually, these are antique poker chips.  That was bought in upstate.  That's why his mom went away.  Are you shitting me?  Have you listened to this show? 
[01:54:00]  Why would you bring in poker chips?  The thing is, though, it'll linger longer.  That's an antique.  Those are nice.  Look at those old.  Can I read the card, please?  They're called dirty poker chips.  Can I read the card?  This was from some antique place out in upstate.  That's kind of cool, actually.  Can I have those poker chips?  Look at that.  Those are nice.  Can I have those poker chips?  Yeah.  Can I read the card?  You want to see the poker chips?  Let me read the card, though.  That's really nice.  Congratulations.  May your new little beauty not be like mine. 
[01:54:30]  Signed, Bobo's mom.  Oh, shit.  That's really nice.  That's not what it says.  It certainly does right there.  That's what my mother wrote.  She wrote that?  Yeah.  That's funny.  Well, thank you.  That's nice.  Bobo got your gift in there.  That's thoughtful.  That is pretty cool.  Bobo did right there.  Bobo, why did you?  Well, look at what you got me.  Can someone clean off the oatmeal off the Bobo?  Oh, an Osborne's lunchbox.  Because I like Ozzy.  Yep.  And it's got the thermos still inside. 
[01:55:00]  What?  The thermos.  The thermos is still inside.  He said thermal.  Thermos.  I know.  That's why I was asking.  If that was me, it would be a fucking investigation.  Yeah, check out my poker chips, Opie.  Check them out.  They're pretty cool.  When Bobo had chips.  Those are nice.  This might be worth something.  Wow.  It's not worth anything.  When Bobo called us, he said.  Those are antiques, you dummy.  What?  When Bobo called us, he said he had a vintage Ozzy lunchbox for Jim.  And that is an Osborne.  Should we?  Just leave it right there.  Just in case.  My mother didn't get this. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, man.  The thermos is included, too.  The thermos.  Thank you, Daniel.  I will.  You're not getting back in the show.  I'll treasure this.  Thank you very much, my little kid.  Are these bribes?  Are you uncomfortable?  Are these bribes?  No.  This was stuff I found, and I figured, you know what?  Anthony would like this.  Exactly what you guys use in life.  Yeah, where did you buy this?  This was around the same place in upstate.  It was a store?  Yeah.  Yeah, because you know what?  It was a yard sale.  Instead of using the custom-made chips with all the characters from the show on them that 
[01:56:00]  cost, I don't know how much money to have made in a professional case, I'm going to use  the antique ones, Fobo.  Why?  That's pretty neat.  Yeah, you got a little reminder of a time when you could feel, when you wouldn't be so  ridiculed for saying whatever you say at the pillow.  What the fuck was that?  Who cares?  Am I talking?  That's what we hear, Rich. 
[01:56:30]  Now you can enjoy it, too.  Holy fuck, I lost that.  An Osborne family lunch spot.  That's a collector's item.  Yeah, it's a good guy that cares.  It is an antique, Rich.  You're right, from 2002 or 2003.  That's what classifies an antique.  Well, my...  No.  Unfortunately, my mother didn't give me the whole specific stuff.  Hold on, hold on.  Maybe someday even you will be worth something.  Smell these poker chips.  What's that?  No, they fell on his kitchen floor. 
[01:57:00]  They were in a fire.  I'm serious.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Smell these.  They were in a fire.  You can smell these.  You can smell the fire.  Yeah, that's from a fire cell.  Where?  What smells like fire?  The chips themselves.  Yeah.  Fucking idiots.  All right, what are we doing?  So, what did you get for Anthony?  His shirt didn't arrive yet.  I said, what did you get for Anthony?  Yeah.  Those poker chips.  What's that?  The poker chips. 
[01:57:30]  What's that?  I got Anthony those poker chips.  What do you want?  I'm right here.  The gift I got for Anthony was those antique poker chips.  What's that?  I got them with his antique poker chips.  What's that?  What I got for Anthony was those antique poker chips.  That's not like fire.  I think there was a letter from John Cheever in there, too.  Who's John?  Smell them.  Seinfeld.  Oh.  Have you seen the bib?  These chips were in the fire.  Yeah. 
[01:58:00]  They were in a fire.  That's a cute bib.  Look at that.  Look at that.  A little Mets bib for the little guy.  Oh.  Look at that.  Wash that, though.  Nice gifts.  I don't want the Mets book, though.  Oh, come on.  Meet the Mets.  Greet the Mets.  Step right up and play golf with the Mets.  One of my favorite lines ever.  They're not going to play.  It was in October.  Step right up and play golf with the Mets.  Because they stink.  Because they weren't going to the post.  They certainly were not. 
[01:58:30]  Step right up and play golf with the Mets.  Well, let's play some pyramids.  Who did that?  You did?  Yeah, they did.  Oh, that's hilarious.  The Mets got knocked out.  Of course, they didn't play golf with the Mets.  Bobo, thanks for the gifts.  You're welcome.  Wonderful.  Yes, thank you.  Thank you, Bobo.  Bobby, you all right?  Yeah, I'm just googling some shit.  Are you upset?  You didn't get a gift from Bobo?  No.  Because I'm a little hurt.  Wait, we're going to get a gift for him.  He'll get the gift of knowledge and winning the $25,000 pyramid. 
[01:59:00]  Why do I still have Bobo?  Playing with Bobo.  Oh, did you switch?  What happened?  I'll take Bobo, I guess.  Oh, you saw Oscar?  Bobo.  Now, listen to this, though.  Oscar.  Yeah.  Have you ever played $25,000 pyramid?  No.  Have you ever seen it?  No.  Okay.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Have you ever seen the $25,000 pyramid?  No, you gave him away already.  My mother has watched that show.  And you've seen it.  What is this fucking Norman Bates?  What the fuck? 
[01:59:30]  The mom's been dead for seven years.  Yeah, yeah.  She's up in his attic.  She's in the attic.  It's the smell.  She's a whore, Bobo.  She's a whore.  What?  Do you live at home with your mom still?  Psycho.  Yeah.  It's my mother and my 14-year-old sister.  Oh.  Oh, now you're talking.  Do you got a picture of her yet?  No, I don't have a picture of her.  Did she ever come home crying with cake on her, honey?  All I know is I could give you her name. 
[02:00:00]  You could look her up on her Facebook.  No, no, no, no.  A bug just crawled out of the poker chips.  No, it didn't.  You sure that wasn't Anthony's hair?  You've got to be careful of bed bugs.  Anthony.  You're just mean.  Oh, really?  Rich is just going to mean today.  Yeah.  He's in Meanville.  Oh, really?  Yeah, you're a real asshole. 
[02:00:30]  Yes, Bobby.  Be careful of bed bugs.  That's how you get bed bugs through fucking that shit.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, but don't even touch it.  That's right.  It's probably got bed bugs.  Oh, really?  It smells like fire.  It was in a fire.  And the bugs are not going to be living in the fucking poker chips.  That's how you get bed bugs through those fucking antique places and all that shit.  There's a little bug that walked out of the poker chips.  I'm telling you.  Absolutely.  I bet those chips are haunted.  It wasn't a cockroach or anything.  You don't have a fucking shop in those fucking antique places or those stupid  stores with old shirts.  Really?  That's how you get bed bugs.  Yeah, people just give them.  They don't wash that shit. 
[02:01:00]  I thought you got them from beds.  Now the box doesn't close properly.  Sometimes there's moths in them.  Right?  Don't fucking make it like, I hate when you do that.  When you're one year jokes bombs.  Like it was a legit question.  Yeah.  Yeah, I thought you got it from beds.  Yeah.  And you delivered it like a punchline.  Stop it.  Come on.  You get bed bugs from that shit.  Really?  Get that away from me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bed bugs are epidemic.  They have in the movie theater, AMC on 42nd, Regal Theater, Times Square, bed bugs.  You hear about the Ground Zero Mosque?  We already know this. 
[02:01:30]  I don't like your weak old news.  That's my new segment on the show.  I come in a week later and I give you all the news.  I kind of like it.  You know what, dude?  Bloomberg got elected again.  Obama's president.  Oscar likes that one, huh?  All right, so who's partnering with who here?  I'll take, I'm going to take Bobo because I feel bad for him.  You can't have him and then get rid of him and take him back.  Yeah, I can.  He's mine.  I didn't fucking sign any papers.  He is a thing. 
[02:02:00]  And Rich is a thing.  If you take Bobo, you have a better chance of getting bed bugs because he brought those  here.  That's right.  So he might have bed bugs on him.  And Bobby, Rich is gambling again.  No, you're not.  Breaking fucking news.  Yes, he is.  I'm not gambling.  He calls it friendly gambling.  You called the what?  He calls it friendly gambling.  What are you doing?  So he's okay.  What are you doing?  I played the lottery a couple of days.  You're a fucking idiot.  You can't do that.  Why not?  It's gambling.  I know.  Tell him about the hold'em. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, at a golf tournament.  But it wasn't, it was free money.  No one cares where it was.  I drank, but it was at a christening.  No one gives a shit.  So we're worried.  And he wants a little action on this game we're about to play, too.  Fuck is wrong with you.  He wants a little action.  You're smoking again.  So what?  That's not gambling.  Yeah, with your life.  So what?  Oh, he was ready to say something there.  Can you stop spitting shit out? 
[02:03:00]  What is that on your lip?  I don't know.  Last night.  The two of you are acting like you're concerned for each other, but it's really just a chance  to be mean to each other.  I really give a shit that he's gambling.  Gambling.  He doesn't care that you're smoking, though.  He doesn't care.  No, I did.  Shut up.  Stop trying to be sincere.  You're not a nice person, Asperger's.  Listen to me.  I am a nice person.  I was voted nice person.  Hey, would you do this?  I was voted what?  Nice person?  My high school reunion is in November, and they want me to go, even though I didn't graduate, 
[02:03:30]  because I'm semi-big.  Oscar, why are you laughing at that?  He laughed at semi-big.  Hold on, hold on, Oscar.  Why is your headphone all fucked up?  You're looking retarded.  It's broken.  Of course it is.  Because you stretched it out.  Yeah, his big head didn't fit her.  It's a fucking hula hoop with two hands on it.  I know.  Who puts...  Nothing.  No, it was an expensive pair, so I said, hey, I might as well just keep it and tape it  up and still use it. 
[02:04:00]  All right, sorry, Rich.  I interrupted you.  What do you say, Rich?  High school reunion?  Nothing?  Okay.  Do you go to that kind of stuff?  Reunions?  I haven't been in a little while.  Nah, what's a one and fifth reunion?  I have no desire.  I like going to those.  I just got my high school yearbook photo.  You did?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  If he ever doubts his fucking race again, you're not a white person.  I'm Irish.  You're not Irish.  I'm Irish.  You're not Irish.  That tight, curly mullet is so good.  It's fucking...  He's Richie Valens.  Did you see my bolo tie, though? 
[02:04:30]  My bolo tie stinks.  I had an Arizona rock cut in half and polished on my neck.  It's terrible.  With turquoise.  A big turquoise polished thing with silver.  A bolo tie.  Like, he's out in fucking New Mexico.  To quote Colin Quinn, you're more Puerto Rican than a purple dress shirt.  One of Colin Quinn's great lines from the Colin Quinn show on NBC.  That's great.  Well, let's play Pyramid.  What do you say?  How's this going to work?  Let's play the Pyramid.  I want to hear some more quotes. 
[02:05:00]  That was good, Rich.  We're going to have...  That was a good quote.  That was a fucking great quote.  You wait for a bad quote.  Since you've been gambling, you turn into a fucking meanie.  Exactly.  I'm a meanie?  I bet you would.  See, that was friendly.  Now, Bobby and Bobo are partners.  That just goes, I guess.  And, of course, Rich and Oscar will be partners.  What is going to happen is, one at a time, they will be seated.  And, one person must give clues.  Another person must say what these clues are leading to. 
[02:05:30]  Right.  You can't use...  Oh, hold on.  Shh.  Oh, I was going to listen.  Dude, your ass is fucking old.  Rich showed Bobby his asshole.  He just sprayed a fart on you, Bobby.  But his ass is just old.  You know when an ass gets old, when the bottom of it just isn't there anymore?  Oh, no.  It drops out?  Yeah, it just drops out.  It becomes like a hammy. 
[02:06:00]  It goes behind your kneecaps.  Yeah, your hamstring just goes...  My ass is tight as hell.  What are you fucking crazy?  Oh, God.  It's just fucking an old ass.  It's tight.  Norm has a fucking nice ass.  Oh, Jesus.  Why are you defending...  What the fuck are you getting into your ass?  Rich is all jealous.  It's not an old ass.  Rich is now jealous.  It's an old ass.  He shows up his ass.  Bobby likes Jim's ass over yours.  His ass.  His ass is not...  Over your ass?  Absolutely.  Your ass is...  You have an ass like William Holden. 
[02:06:30]  My ass can't advance your career, but his can.  His can't advance my career?  Are you kidding?  I've been hanging out with him for fucking ten years.  What's happened?  I'm playing pyramid with retards.  Look at your ass!  Doesn't he let you co-host that free radio show he does?  What else are we going to do in the afternoon?  Nothing.  Obviously not exercise.  That's true.  Oh, shit.  Rich is fucking vicious today.  This is the thing with Vos, though. 
[02:07:00]  He comes...  He'll punch himself out.  He punches himself out.  You think he's dead.  And then he comes back with a killer.  You fucking awful assy assholes.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, Rich is awesome today.  Fucking terrible.  Oh, shit.  How's your ear?  Does it still stink?  No, no.  Because Oscar's leaving.  I think in honor he should...  Oh, Oscar.  Oh, Oscar.  Oscar.  You really should.  You've got to tell him what's worse.  What's worse, belly button or ear?  We've all done it except for Anthony in this room, I believe. 
[02:07:30]  Oscar.  You've got to bring the mic up.  Come on.  I've done it.  I've done it.  Hold on.  I take it off.  Just my right ear.  My left ear was fed off.  I've done this.  Where's Oscar going?  What am I doing?  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy's right.  Wait, wait, wait.  Please look at that.  Take a big sniff.  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.  That is crazy.  Oh, my God.  I never smell something.  Oh, shit.  Dude, is that...  Oh, wow.  Is that dude?  Damn.  What did it smell like?  Like rotten tuna? 
[02:08:00]  Jesus Christ.  It's actually not that bad enough.  No.  Okay.  Exactly.  Exactly.  I'm telling you, this is going to knock that out.  It just made Danny sad.  Jimmy, I'm filming now, so do it again.  Well, the ear is the big one.  Yeah, but Jimmy, let Oscar smell your belly button.  Well, it's not bad enough.  Get a good one.  Let's see.  Let's see if it's still bad. 
[02:08:30]  Get a good pocket.  Get a good one, Oscar.  Come on, Oscar.  Take a good sniff.  No!  Fucking tear gas.  Why is his eyes watering up?  It was worse the second time because it's just like I got a chunk of it.  What does it smell like?  Breakfast back in Columbia.  It smells like rotten tuna in like old cabinet.  It's trying to get him home sick.  All right.  Oh, my God. 
[02:09:00]  He hates bees.  Oscar.  Try the ears more.  Blueberries.  It's weird.  Move over to Rich Voss's fucking microphone.  Get close.  Are you all clear?  I think so.  All right.  Hold on.  Oh, man.  I can feel this.  Clear your palate with a dead raccoon.  For the people that don't know, Rich has this weird odor that comes from a cyst behind  his ear.  Oh, this is.  And you got a lot today, Rich?  Yeah.  All right.  Good luck, Oscar.  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No! 
[02:09:30]  That Voss is here in fucking five years.  A little bit.  Come on, Bobby.  Bobby!  Come on, Bobby.  Come on.  You can do this.  You can do this.  You can do this.  Come on, Bobby.  A little bit.  Here we go.  Get a good one.  Get a good one. 
[02:10:00]  What's your glasses?  All your glasses on glasses.  That was the fucking worst.  Was it bad? 
[02:10:30]  As opposed to good.  I don't even know what the fuck that smell is.  Your career.  That's fucking instant.  That's fucking instant.  They should bottle that.  You should bottle that and use it in prisons. 
[02:11:00]  Everything's tearing like a gas chamber.  It's so fucking bad, Voss.  No, Voss, get away.  I never have and I never will get away.  I swear to God.  Anthony, it's interesting.  No, I don't need that.  Oh, God.  Danny, what was worse?  Mine or his?  I know what that smells like.  Try it, Danny.  It's new.  It's new and improved.  I'll tell you why I don't want to do it.  Because it's not like it's just a bad smell for like 24 seconds or whatever. 
[02:11:30]  It stays with you.  It stays with you all day.  It really does.  Sam, come on, a little bit.  I just don't feel it.  It's running out.  It's running out.  Come on, before it runs out.  It's got like a half-life to it.  Go ahead, Sam.  Sam won't puke.  He just...  Oh, that's fun.  Take a good sniff.  Oh, that's fun.  Oh, that's fun.  Oh, that's fun.  Oh, that's fun.  Oh, that's fun.  Oh, that's fun.  Oh, that's fun.  Oh, that's fun.  Bobby! 
[02:12:00]  Bobby's just throwing up again because...  No!  I don't smell like you don't have to do it again.  Bobby, you didn't smell Jimmy's belly button.  My belly button will be raspberry jam after that.  Yeah?  Oh, boy.  What's the matter, Sam?  How was that, Sam?  No, wipe it off the table.  No!  Wipe it off the table.  Wipe it off the table.  It leaves a grease stain when he wipes it on the table.  Does it smell on the table?  No, I don't smell the table.  Lick it up.  Don't you smell it?  Does it smell?  Oh, lick it up, Bobby. 
[02:12:30]  Lick it up.  Yeah, yeah.  We're like, Andy.  We're like...  You're like...  You're fucking stupid.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Just smell the table.  Just see if it smells.  Hold on.  Just test it.  It probably doesn't smell on the table, can't you?  What?  If you don't smell that, you sell it.  How would you wipe that up?  You couldn't see it.  Everyone's puking.  Everyone's just throwing off.  Anthony, you just smell that.  No fucking way. 
[02:13:00]  Once in your life.  You should do it once.  Just do it once.  I can't do it.  I won't do it.  Just once.  I won't.  I won't.  I won't.  I won't use.  It smells like an 18-year-old.  No, it doesn't.  Dead one.  Dead one.  18-year-old wounds.  Oh, fuck.  No.  I can't hear some of my eyes.  There's one guy who hasn't smelled it.  I don't have anything.  Yes, you do.  Get a little more.  I really don't have anything.  Get some.  I don't think.  You're a fucking cobra.  You've just been desensitized.  You run out of venom?  A cobra. 
[02:13:30]  Wipe this up, Rich.  Come on.  I did.  I cleaned it.  I cleaned it.  Water.  Yeah, I cleaned it with water.  It's a grease mark on the counter.  Yeah, he put it on the counter, and it just made a grease slick.  Oh, God.  That's hilarious.  Oh, man.  That's hilarious.  Bobby, you instantly started vomiting.  I've never called me the other day since I have it, too.  It's worse.  What?  Oh, your daughter has it?  I got it, too.  I gave it to my boyfriend.  And she's all excited?  Oh, no.  Why would you be proud of that?  Bobo, you've got to take some.  Is it behind her ear or somewhere else? 
[02:14:00]  Bobo, you've got to take some.  Bobo, you've got to take some.  It's behind her ear.  Let's stop out there.  Behind her rear.  Bobo, you've got to take some.  The rear is a black man.  Oh, God.  Bobo, you take some.  Bobo's up 100.  Yeah.  Shut up.  You do.  Yes, you do.  I don't.  You're just desensitized.  You're festering heat.  Go ahead, Bobo.  Smell.  Yeah, that's why we shouldn't have done that.  Just ruined the whole 20 minutes.  I know.  Jesus. 
[02:14:30]  Let's make Tiger Woods face work.  You always want to leave him.  Bobo has more.  Terrible footwear on today, by the way.  Is Bobo acting here?  I would just like to call attention to Bobo's awful sandals.  I think Derek is walking barefoot somewhere.  Bobo's just trying really hard to get back on the show.  Oh, he is?  Yeah.  He's more so hard.  I don't know.  I'm not really.  I don't know a lot about radio, but wouldn't him being here right now, being back on the  show?  Wow, even Rich picked up on it.  Hey, do we have any hand wash fucking stuff? 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, that's why there's some sanitizers.  Hey, hey, hey.  There you go, man.  Sorry.  You're really in seeing your ears, dude.  Rich, you something on your finger.  Your ear is instantly.  I mean, I've never smelled anything that instant.  It's revulsion.  It instantly goes up in your nose and fucks with the nerves.  It violates you.  It fucking violates you.  What is the scent?  Is it dead animal?  Is it dead meat?  It's its own fucking scent, dude.  There's nothing.  Do you want a little belly button? 
[02:15:30]  It's not much left.  You can't describe it.  It violates your senses.  It's almost like an asshole, cheese, and some type of dead creature.  I don't want you to be upset the rest of the show because of your obsessive-compulsive  behavior.  I'm not obsessive-compulsive.  I'm just sitting by your nose grease stain.  Really?  Yes.  It's not the stain you're used to?  That didn't make sense.  What do you mean?  Now he's spraying the table.  Now, I think that scent- 
[02:16:00]  Shut up.  We're going to take a break.  We have a couple of napkins.  A couple of napkins.  Shut up.  We're going to play Pyramid next with Bobo and Oscar and Robert Kelly and Rich Voss,  who is going to be at Governor's Comedy Club tonight and tomorrow.  Rich Voss, Governor's Comedy Club, Long Island.  Stay there.  It's the Opie and Anthony show on the virus, Sirius XM.  She's a woman, you know what I mean.  You better listen, listen to me.  She's going to set you free. 
[02:16:30]  Opie, Anthony, Jim, Norton.  Norton's got tickets on sale in an hour.  Kenny!  Hey, I'm sick.  Fuck you.  Jimmy's not here.  What's his plug for the tickets?  Foxwoods.com, 10 o'clock.  10 o'clock today, Foxwoods.com for Jim Norton tickets.  Yeah.  Those are going to go very, very fast.  Fast.  I think we're going to make a weekend of it and go up there.  What day is it?  Thursday to Saturday, October 14th to 16th. 
[02:17:00]  14th to 16th.  Oh, man, really?  Yeah.  All right.  When and when?  I might have a wedding.  October 14th to 16th, one show Thursday, two shows each.  Friday and Saturday.  But the headline tickets go on sale in an hour.  Rich Voss is going to be at Governor's Comedy Club tonight and tomorrow in Levittown in Long  Island.  I highly recommend you see Rich.  We beat the shit out of him on this show.  But, man, I mean, you do good on the radio as well.  But I don't want people to think you suck on a stage because you certainly don't.  I've never failed. 
[02:17:30]  You fucking certainly don't.  So check out Rich at Governor's Comedy Club this weekend, okay?  Right.  And, Bobby, your plug's way too...  Fuck you.  I'm playing this weekend.  Next...  Fuck you.  You suck my dick.  Bobby's going to be at the Playboy Comedy Club at the Palms in Las Vegas.  Nice.  I love it.  You did it this weekend?  Yeah, it's one of my favorite tickets.  Not this weekend.  Not this weekend.  Labor Day weekend.  Labor Day weekend.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, September 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.  Palms is a great room.  Wow, what are you doing Thanksgiving?  Come back in next week with that. 
[02:18:00]  We're not going to be here.  That's why we're going to do this.  Now, when you go out there...  Listen, listen, stupid.  No fucking court is...  No, don't make it that serious.  You're such a dickhead.  Fuck an hour from now.  We did yours, Jimmy.  We did a...  Yours was the best plug of all.  Kenny really hyped it.  Yeah, the first plug is always the best.  Can I get one of those?  Because you weren't here.  Self-inflicted gunshot wound?  Yes.  Do you take that on the road with you now?  No, it's too heavy.  It's an iPad.  I leave it home.  Why would I take a portable, handheld, little computer like this on the road?  No, no, no. 
[02:18:30]  Absolutely not.  I bring it here and home and no further.  30 blocks or less is the rule.  Why would you ask that, Rich?  He just doesn't know what he's saying.  You travel all the time.  Doesn't it look like something that looks perfect for traveling?  Can you bring that on the road?  It's a suitcase.  Rich, explain yourself.  Do you wear those outside?  They're shoes.  I'll keep going.  Rich, explain it, though.  Why would you ask that?  The main reason?  He's dumb.  Good. 
[02:19:00]  Okay, I thought it was new, and he's just learning.  I don't have any answers.  I don't have...  It was a dumb question.  The best is when you just admit defeat.  It's my favorite part of your appearance.  It was kind of dumb.  It's fucking hot in here.  What's that right there on the side?  It's a button.  It's called on.  It's an on button and off button.  Do you leave the button at home so you don't lose it?  All right, we get it.  Why are there holes in it?  I'm going to keep doing it.  No.  That'd be convenient for headphones if you could do that.  That's it.  Just ruin him now.  That's it.  Go ahead.  You go again.  Go again. 
[02:19:30]  Just moments of brilliance.  He said he has a...  Tell him about the spray you bring on the road in the hotels for the day.  We're going to play our game.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Because we were going to save it for another day because there's too many voices on the show.  But basically, because now you referenced it, me and Bobby are setting up possibly another  Match the Hatch weekend.  Fishing.  And when we went last year, we had horrible side-of-the-road motels.  Yeah.  Motel rooms with a guy that didn't speak English with horrible breath. 
[02:20:00]  He actually kicked a couple out of my room.  Yeah.  Someone was in my room.  I go to Kings.  I can't sleep in a fucking twin bed.  No.  And I fucking complained so bad.  So...  Say you're back.  And you're out again.  So what happened?  I made him kick a couple...  He just went in and kicked a couple out.  And he didn't change the sheets.  He just brushes them off real fast.  That's the type of shitty place we were at.  No joke.  It was a horrible place, but it was the only place we could stay for the Match the Hatch weekend.  And we had motel rooms right next door to each other. 
[02:20:30]  And mine was like...  It was like the Bates Motel.  It was scary as shit.  Quick question.  We could have used the bugs in your room to fish with.  And we actually found bugs in my room.  Well, but who named it Match the Hatch?  Was it a radio promo thing or something?  That's a whole thing.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  I just did...  You were in Olive.  Huh?  Is that Olive?  Oh, back to fucking food.  No, it's green.  Olive's barely a food, though.  It's a garnish.  Okay, so you had...  It's sort of a food.  You had to Match the Hatch weekend.  Yeah, which is just too long to get into. 
[02:21:00]  It's been going...  It's an ongoing thing with me and Bobby.  But hold on.  Really fast.  So mine...  I'm dealing with my shitty, scary motel room.  And I walk over to say hi to Bobby and his lovely wife.  And it looks like a fucking spa.  No, he's not going to fucking deny this.  His wife brings all this shit on the road.  It smelled nice.  It looked nice.  There was candles and incense burning.  And like Japanese shit floating around.  She brings all the radiation.  Right.  I don't like that Opie set you up. 
[02:21:30]  Opie had a great setup.  That was a perfect joke.  You know what Bobby...  You guys are on a fucking improv team now?  No, Bobby, hold on.  Why don't you do your hands?  Why don't you put your hands behind Opie's back and he'll talk?  Fuck you.  I'm trying with you.  But here's the thing.  Bobby said...  Very close.  Very close.  You saved him, Anthony, with your fucking scratchy cigarette laugh.  It's I was singing last night karaoke.  Oh, you were? 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  I'm going to fall back on.  I've never been to that house.  This should be a reality show at that fucking house.  You do it at your house?  Yeah, I got a whole karaoke thing.  How lonely are you?  Very close.  Listen, so...  Anthony's door is just open.  I know.  Or shoes on Tuesday.  Playing lawn darts.  It really is.  I know.  Jesus.  Come on, kids.  I have the best toys.  Nobody wants to go to your fucking dumb karaoke. 
[02:22:30]  Who want?  Danny?  You and Danny?  I'd go.  Why wouldn't you want to go?  Sometimes.  I'd like to go.  Why would I go to someone's house to sing karaoke with a bunch of guys?  I didn't say that.  You can't argue that logic.  I'm always a bunch of guys.  Huh?  Sometimes there's girls there.  Yeah, yeah, really?  Now why would I go sing karaoke with a bunch of minors?  Stop right there.  I have a life.  I have kids.  I'm like, oh, oh, Wednesday, I got a night off.  Let's go to Anthony's and sing in his basement. 
[02:23:00]  There could be nothing fucking worse than that.  Jesus, except you spitting in my face.  I'm sorry.  Does Dawn have a cologne for that?  Well, you know he's going to punch himself out.  It does happen.  He did punch himself out.  But you know what?  He had a good one.  But he worked up with the olives.  But the point is, Bobby, it doesn't matter where he stays because his wife turns the fucking  place into a really, really nice hotel room or motel room in this case.  He sprays on the bed.  Yeah, he ran in my room all excited and was rubbing down my fucking pillowcases and stuff  for me.  Because, no, there's oils and stuff, certain oils you can have. 
[02:23:30]  But he said he sprays on the bed and it gets the bedbugs mad.  He doesn't say that.  You said that.  Don't put your fucking slurpy words in my mouth.  You said they get them mad.  When you said that, what did you say?  I said the bedbugs, it's the oil that you put in the room.  On the bed.  On the bed, or all over the room, actually, and the bedbugs don't like it.  That's what I said.  They don't like it.  No, they don't like it.  So now they're going to get mad.  They don't have fucking wrinkled eyebrows and walking around punching stuff. 
[02:24:00]  I'm fucking pissed off.  Shut up.  Well, if they don't like it, they're going to get mad.  They don't go near it.  No, they don't get, they don't have, I don't know if bedbugs have emotions, you fucking  dick shit.  Well, you know, you seem to know a lot about them.  They don't like it.  You know they're living into poker chips.  That is true.  Obviously, you've been serving bedbugs.  Smell these poker chips.  There's definitely something in here.  Dude, fuck.  It smells like fire.  Fire?  And the felt is like, I bet you there's shit going on under this felt.  Fucking Anthony, that's good. 
[02:24:30]  What?  Anthony, you don't.  I was just yawning.  Too much singing last night, huh?  Yes.  Carioc, you just have no fun.  He really doesn't have fun.  You're not a fun guy.  You're not a fun person.  You know, Bonnie tells me that all the time.  You're not fun.  You listen to talk radio.  You don't listen to music.  Yeah, NPR all the time.  You just come over the house.  I'm going to listen to that fucking hogwash.  They go in the pool.  They fucking come over the house, go in the pool, could watch a movie in the movie theater,  fucking sing karaoke, play poker. 
[02:25:00]  All right, Bruce, there's millions.  Listen, Anthony's house is fun.  He's actually Bruce's thousands.  Bruce's thousands.  Anthony's house is fucking fun.  You're not fun.  You're not fun.  You're not fun.  You're not fun.  Anthony says you're not fun.  Yeah, you know what?  You're not fun.  Maybe I should just take a good look instead of pointing the finger while I'm pointing  three back at me.  Maybe I should turn it around.  Oh, turn it around.  All you do is golf.  We're in Montreal with you, two of your best friends.  You didn't hang out with us once.  Yes, I did one time.  You did nothing.  Because you guys were talking about your radio show.  No, we weren't. 
[02:25:30]  You were doing prep.  No, we weren't.  Yeah.  Doing prep.  I thought you were getting Vic Henley in again, and you were prepping.  I don't fucking know.  We were walking around, going to eat, looking at little shops.  Really?  Be a friend.  Stop being a friend at night.  I played golf in a day.  I made other friends.  One day.  Stop being so wrapped up in your head.  Stop trying to fucking advance your career.  You're not a good friend.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I was advancing my career?  Yeah, yeah.  You don't know who I play golf with.  Huh?  You don't know who I play golf with.  It doesn't matter.  Bob, he's not advancing his career.  If he played golf with fucking Katzenberg and Spielberg, he couldn't help it. 
[02:26:00]  A lot of Berg's in that one.  Well, you know.  It's show business.  Are we done with the bed bugs?  We're good?  Yeah.  All right.  So Bobby just makes his motel business.  I did hang out with him in Montreal.  No, you didn't.  You didn't.  You were awful.  I was there.  You guys had your wives and girlfriends, and I'm by the way.  So you had you.  So what?  She didn't come to me.  We weren't fucking in the restaurant.  If I'm not playing golf with you, I don't know who you are.  He's not a fun guy.  That's true.  He tried to put music on.  He's like, I don't like this music.  Like, when you're not playing golf, what's the second thing you like to do? 
[02:26:30]  Gamble.  Watch golf.  Yeah, exactly.  What's the second thing I like to do?  I love going, well, not anymore.  I used to love going to my daughter's basketball games.  Oh, boo.  What?  What do you mean?  Oh, you know the phone numbers I got?  Not fun.  The player's friends.  That's not fun with your friends, I'm saying.  Anthony's playing karaoke.  Me and Obi would fly fishing.  Norton goes fuck a hookah hunting.  I play golf.  If I play golf, you like to fish, okay?  That's not the only thing I like to do. 
[02:27:00]  Huh?  I do.  Go ahead, Rich.  Video games and shit.  Go ahead, Rich.  Norton just had nine things he held back to give you the ball.  I'm not here to attack you.  Take your shot.  I'm not here.  You just didn't have something.  All right, let's play Pyramid then.  Fuck it.  Let's play Pyramid.  Yeah, we should play Pyramid.  Bobby's got to be on the bottom.  Oscar.  Really?  Really?  You see Oscar's head?  They weren't laughing at you, by the way.  I know.  Oscar.  I'm not being mean to you.  Shut up.  Oscar, lift your arms up.  Oh, no.  Lift.  Lift.  Jesus. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, no.  Look at his belly hanging out.  Hey, Oscar, whose jeans are you wearing?  Sam's?  No, I didn't love you.  Why is your clothes so tight?  Why do Mexicans always have fucking big tight clothes?  Because he's bloated.  I'm not bloated.  I understand.  Jesus.  No, no.  I didn't want you.  What happened?  I left it a little extra in the dryer.  Extra?  Extra, yeah.  What'd you do?  Laundry at a fucking hotel?  Dryer?  No, at my house.  It was just a couple weekends ago.  Can E-Rock smell his pits?  Oh, yes.  Please.  Before you do laundry, do you knock on everybody's door in your house and take out your sheets 
[02:28:00]  and stuff?  Hey, Oscar, go get me an ashtray.  Good, good, good.  Hey, I need my, um, the room's gotta be painted.  My fucking head.  So how's this pyramid gonna work, Dan?  Rich's puzzled face.  It's like, what the fuck is that?  It's called his face.  It's working like a radio thing.  They could take turns going back and forth until they get a deal.  It's just an excuse to make sure.  And whenever we get tired of it, whoever has the most points wins.  All right.  No, they're prescription. 
[02:28:30]  What's wrong with Bobo, man?  This fucking guy's freaking me out.  He's like, he sees that Oscar's getting all the attention.  Why are you so sad, Bobo?  He has juicy lips.  Bobo?  He has juicy lips.  You're right.  That's just the eye allergies.  That's all.  You got what?  I don't know.  Who's doing Dancing with the Stars the day after he gets raped?  Look at him.  Why are you so quiet and sad?  What's the matter?  That wasn't that right, right?  Danny was creeping me out.  Bobo's hairy, man.  He looks like he's almost one of those little hairy monsters at the carnival. 
[02:29:00]  You want to see his hairy asshole?  No.  I've fucking seen it.  You want to see his hairy asshole, Bobby?  I've already puked.  I don't want to.  I'm all set.  I was just saying.  I've seen it.  I've seen it.  No problem.  It's fucking disgusting.  Yeah, he puked during the cherry dog.  It looks like somebody stabbed a fucking wild boar.  Why are you picking your nose?  What are you doing?  Sometimes I have real big ones.  Oh, yeah.  He gets long fucking boogers.  Really?  Nice.  Do you remember the one that hung like this?  Look at intestines.  Fuck, man.  Look at that nose.  Didn't someone eat that one?  Yeah, your intern licked it. 
[02:29:30]  Oh.  E-Rock, can you smell Oscar's pits?  E-Rock.  They're not going to be bad.  No.  They're not that bad.  They're half and half.  Lift your arm.  Smells like Old Spice.  Really?  Exactly.  E-Rock's fucking what?  Curry?  You want to smell Bobo's asshole?  That's an Old Spice.  It sure is.  All right.  E-Rock's gone.  He looks like the Colombian brawn man.  That was a bust.  A what?  What does he look like?  Two in a row.  Thanks.  Thanks, Richard. 
[02:30:00]  I had two in a row?  You bailed me out.  Oh, I did.  Your curry joke was good, because technically it is an Older Spice.  Technically.  You always want a joke to be explained by saying technically.  Yes, sir.  I got nothing.  All right.  Listen, why don't we do this?  So, who goes first, Sam and Danny?  These guys.  Where did that come from?  Fucking A.  His nose.  God damn it, boss.  What's wrong with you?  That's Anthony's kryptonite.  He can't handle boogers.  Dude, really?  Boogers, you think?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, you don't like them?  I used to eat my boogers.  Get out of here.  I used to pick my nose and roll the boogers on my upper lip and make them into a perfect 
[02:30:30]  ball.  I used to do this.  If you suck one finger and pick a booger with the other finger, you'd suck two.  How old were you going to do this?  Teenager?  Actually, the first time in juvie jail was the last time I ever did it.  At 13, I went to jail and I was so worried they were going to find me doing that that  I would get killed.  So, it was the last time I ever did it.  I just stopped doing it that night.  I used to pick boogers out of my nose, like really big ones and wet ones. 
[02:31:00]  And if they were too wet, I'd put them under like a dresser or a table and let  them dry.  So, after school, I'd come and peel them off.  It's not jerky.  And you'd put them back on your nose?  No, I'd put them on my upper lip and roll them into balls.  What an asshole.  And I would try to roll it to a perfect ball and then put it back up in my nose so it could  stay and then I'd pull it back out and then roll it.  Balls on his lip.  What a surprise.  I used to put them under my bed.  But you weren't being sexually abusive.  I used to hang them under my bed.  It looked like a booger graveyard. 
[02:31:30]  It looked like a bunch of icicles.  I had a bunch of those still under the bed.  Yeah, it looked like fucking stalactites.  Like, you know what's fine when you roll them and get them real hard and you throw them  and hear them land on a wooden ball?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's the best.  You can get a booger and just quiet and flick it.  Yeah.  And hear it land.  You know what's the worst when you're picking your nose in a car and then like a week later  you go to touch the steering wheel and there's an old booger stuck on it?  I leave boogers in hotels under the desk all the time.  I'll leave a nice big fat one. 
[02:32:00]  You guys are fucking disgusting.  Can you see this on my lip?  I'm not looking at shit.  Not you.  What's on his lip, Rich?  Go that way.  What's on that way?  What's on his scarecrow?  I'm not looking.  What's on his lip?  What am I, scarecrow?  Because I pointed?  That reference is so far away from anybody.  Exactly.  Stop mentioning your high school films.  Jim.  Here.  What?  Look at this. 
[02:32:30]  Where are you?  Oh, I got to turn the camera around.  Have you been tanning?  Look at that.  Why?  Because of your lip.  Do you got it on there?  No.  Disgusting.  I hate it.  Jim, your shit last night was fucking the worst shit.  I can look in a picture, but I can't look in real life.  Why don't we play Pyramid?  Let's get this going.  Sam.  Danny.  What do we got?  Well, I feel like who got to pick their partner?  I got fucking...  Who do you want?  I'm sorry.  I fucked you up.  Who do you want?  I don't give a fuck.  Rich, who do you want?  Listen, enough.  Let's just take whatever. 
[02:33:00]  Okay, Rich and Oscar then.  Let's just get through this fucking radio bit and have fun again.  All right, let's go.  How about Rich and Oscar starts?  Yep.  Rich and Oscar.  No.  Can I have Bobo?  Let's start the festivities.  No, you just said you don't care.  You just didn't care.  Yeah, fuck you.  I get Oscar.  Oscar, you ready to win this kid?  That's Bobo.  Oh, Bobo.  You ready to win this kid?  Yep, I'm ready.  All right.  Bobo's been being molested by Danny.  Lick your lips.  He doesn't like when you lick your lips.  He'll be giving and he'll be receiving the clues. 
[02:33:30]  We'll start with...  Well, if we go by what happens in life, I'll receive.  Nothing.  You've got to stay over there.  That's true.  Near the mic.  Silence.  I need you near the mic right now.  I'm trashing myself on it.  Right near the mic.  Stay right there.  We'll start with Voss giving.  Voss will be giving the clues.  Explain to fucking...  They've been...  They've been briefed.  Okay, we all know how.  We've got music and stuff.  Pyramid is played.  Yeah.  It's Pyramid.  All right, we're ready to play the Pyramid.  First up, Rich Voss.  And Oscar, the intern. 
[02:34:00]  Rich Voss will be giving the clues.  And of course, Oscar must then take those clues and find out what we're looking for here.  Wait, can't we have to whisper to the audience?  Is Bob allowed to know?  Yeah, I can know.  Okay.  Okay, okay.  Cover your ears.  Cover your ears real hard.  The things in a hospital.  We're looking for things in a hospital.  Okay.  Okay.  Did you hear that?  I didn't think you finished that ear of your ears, Oscar.  Okay.  All right, Rich, go ahead. 
[02:34:30]  Now, Rich, give clues.  All right, ready?  Yes.  AIDS.  AIDS.  Condoms.  Hepatitis.  Sexually transmitted disease.  Nurses.  Nurses.  Nurses.  Category.  Doctors.  Hospital.  There you go.  Does he have to say things you find and all of them, or is just hospitals good enough?  I understand.  I'm on the show.  I'm barely on a leeway.  Yeah, they gave him some leeway.  All right, let's go.  Let's go.  Let's go.  You ready?  Fucking, what's your name?  How about Bobo takes his headphones off?  Bobo, you got to take your headphones off. 
[02:35:00]  Okay.  Take them off your head totally.  So we can tell the audience.  We got to tell the audience what they are.  Shit.  All right.  What they're looking for.  All right.

[02:35:30]  Take your fingers out of your ears.  Things on a boat.  Well, depending on which way it's going until you're empty or full.  I don't like that Anthony and Norton are doing all the jokes for the show.  So now it's just a game show we're playing.  Yeah, exactly.  They just did all the funny lines.  We have nothing now.  The fuck?  I'm just going to have to play the game.  You ready?  Hit the button.  I'm ready.  I get to play a fucking game.  You can't play on mine.  No, you can't.  He's going to give me the clue with his hand facing Bobo. 
[02:36:00]  Yes, stop it.  So Bobo can hear it.  Not me.  The clue.  Shut up, would you?  Go ahead, Bob.  You can do it.  Bobby, go ahead.  Are you ready?  I'm ready.  An anchor.  Anchor.  Anchor.  Fishing rods.  Anchor.  Marina.  Life jackets.  Slaves.  They ate the 1700s.  That was a fucking agreement.  I should have used that.

That's how you got to work with Bobo.  You scare him into fucking being normal.  Swing your partner, dozy dope.  I kind of figured out the answer for the first clue.  No one cares about your process.  Your big victory.  You should have had that fucking ten clues ago. 
[02:37:00]  Jesus Christ, with slaves.  Slaves was fucking great.  So do you want to switch roles or continue?  Yeah, you got to switch roles.  Switch roles.  Yes, yes, yes.  What do you mean?  But that would be good.  Somebody say roles?  Okay.  All right.  Do you know how to do this?  Yeah.  What?  He's going to fucking do these things?  Yes.  And then Bobo is.  I don't want to fucking do that side of it.  Yeah, now they got it.  Let me see the clue.  Okay, so I'm going to give it to him and then show you.  Yeah, we have to...  Rich, you have to cover yours so we can...  Not yet.  I'm almost deaf anyhow. 
[02:37:30]  What?  Thank God Colin wasn't playing this.  He wouldn't be able to cover his ears.  What is it?  I can't ask you where to go.  How long does it take to give the fucking clue?  All right, we got it.  We got it.  Okay.  I think it won.  Go ahead, Oscar.  I think it'll nine.  All right.  Oscar, you're up.  Go ahead.  Give him clues.  Jesus Christ.  I don't know how to...  People that Jews killed. 
[02:38:00]  Wait.  Jesus Christ.  Oscar.  No, I can't have you out of the house.  Go, Oscar.  Come on, give me one clue, you fucking idiot.  Go.  Give him a clue.  Did I pick the right one?  Words.  Things in the dictionary.  Things in the dictionary.  Of a host.  Things that you don't know how to say.  No.  A person.

Yeah.  I just want to see if...  Because he wants to gamble so bad.  Because Dummy couldn't get one fucking clue out.

Well, I do say...  So you would have said damn...  Well, I do say...  Fucking...  Or stupid...  Or...  Get out of my neighborhood.  Get out of my neighborhood.  Yes.  Move...  Holy shit.  The first thing he blurts out...  I would never...  I turned and looked at who was coming through the door. 
[02:44:00]  Do we get robbed or something?  Like another radio show was coming to take over.  All right.  Now we go back to Bobo and Bobby, the real...  Oh, my God.  Damn, man.  It's to those guys, right?  Who gives the clues?  Bobo again?  Yes.  All right, Bobo, you get the clues for this one.  And Bobby has to guess.  And Bobby has to guess.  Take his headphones off.

Chicks that Bobo wants to jerk off his fucking dirty jizzle.  Bobby!  Damn.  Wow.  Again, the music stops.  Stuck on Anthony.  This is so much like $25,000 pyramid where they have a half an hour to answer.  He's like, hey man, we're just watching that clock.  Believe me. 
[02:49:30]  We got one hour to go.  Shut the fuck up.  All right.  Who's next?  Oscar?  Oscar has got to ask Rich Voss.  Let's have Bobo.  Let's get rid of Oscar.  No, Oscar's good.  Oscar's good.  He's fucking good.  Oscar looks like he's playing for the fucking defensive line to the fucking Rams.  I want Oscar to give clues.  Okay.  Wow.  I had to wreck that one out.  I know.  You said fucking too many times.  Yeah, that's the way.  You said fucking and then you used your hands.  The fucking defensive line to the fucking Rams.  Oscar, you give me clues.  Okay.  All right.  Cool. 
[02:50:00]  Fucking bakery.  Rich, that's a gem.  Bobby has credit.  Holy fuck, that was beautiful.  He's fucking good.  He dies.  He dies right off.  Yeah.  I've never seen anybody go off a cliff.  He's on the top holding up a trophy and then he just falls off the back.  Right on a sinkhole.  And unlike you, I don't bounce back.  That's not bad. 
[02:50:30]  Okay.  All right, Oscar.  Cover your ears.  Shut up.  Like, we don't attack each other.  Rich, cover your ears.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  Oh, wow.  Let me see.  Wait, wait, wait.  Let me see.  Take your thing off.  Don't look.  Don't look.  I'm not looking.  I'm not listening.  I'm guessing.  I'm going to play my audience.  Words.  Oh, I can't.  Rich, Ross, you cannot pronounce.  Are you guys ready?  Yes, I'm ready.  The audience is hearing the clues, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Call them and see.  Very easily. 
[02:51:00]  No, they're guessing right along.  Good.  Are you ready?  Yeah.  List.  Things I...  You don't know how this game is played.  Somebody explain how this game is played.  Take them outside.  You see the clue.  Just name some of the things on the clue.  Oh, okay.  That's all.  Let's just say the clue was things on a car.  You don't say that, but you would say tires. 
[02:51:30]  Wheels.  You don't say drives.  Pat, leather shoe and a ribbon.  A hooker's fingerprints.  You know.  All right.  That's how you do it.  All right.  Cool.  So just...  Team one?  Yeah.  Wait, does he...  No?  Asia.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  All right, go ahead.  Oscar.  Oh, shit.  Nothing used to pass to Bobo.  Speech epitome. 
[02:52:00]  No!  No!  You're so fucking stupid.  No!  You understand how this game is played.  No, but I can't think of things...  You're not...  Ah, shut up!  Things that come out of Ridge Foss's mouth.  See...  No, that's not it.  That would be a cock.  That's not it.  We go in.  And then Bainfield resolves.  What do you mean?  He hasn't given me any clues.  Let's say Bobo could do this better.  No, wait, let me try again.  I feel bad.  I don't...  He doesn't know how the words play.  You're allowing Bobo to get back into his radio.  Exactly. 
[02:52:30]  How hard is it to grab and how hard the game plays?  He can't grasp the game.  That's right.  I meant grasp.  Oh, grab.  It's too stupid to grasp the game.  He doesn't get it at all.  He doesn't understand it at all.  Yeah, a cute shirt on Bobo.  It's a 70s.  Never played it before.  No one here did.  What do you think?  We fucking all played $25,000 on paper?  No, well, they do this Thursday nights at Anthony's house.  That's true.  It's on the schedule.  Look into it, Rich.  I have my fun here. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, okay.  Everything else is business.  Yeah.  All right, Bobo.  We'll try it.  Try it on Rich.  All right.  Show Oscar how it's going to be.  Look at me.  Look at Rich.  Focus.  Amazon.com.  A river runs through it.  Okay.  Amazon.com.  A clock worth orange.  Fucking movies.  Things Norton Quotes.  Things Norton does in his spare time.  Keep going, Bobo.  Ron and Fez.  A show with more listeners than this. 
[02:53:30]  Louis Beans.  Oh.  Oh.  Dumb mistakes I've made.  Or things Rich Voss has done in the studios.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Jake Gyllenhaal.  Oh.  Dumb things.  Words that Rich Voss has fucked up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There it is.  Bobo knows how to play.  Yeah.  He's Rayman with this shit.  I know.  With everything.  He takes the comedy out of the room, but he knows how to play the fucking game.  He's a good opening act, too. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, phew.  Oh, yeah.  Well, something smells, right?  Somebody smells?  Something smells.  Somebody smells like a sub sandwich.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Exactly.  Like onions.  Can we have E-Rock try to find the smell?  Yeah.  Somebody stinks.  E-Rock.  Find the stench.  It ain't me.  Where's E-Rock?  He's got to find the smell.  I smell it, mate.  I don't know.  You smell like a sub?  I'm good.  Well, you also look like one.  No, it's not me.  Fucking rich.  Jesus.  Governors tonight and tomorrow night.  Yeah.  Oscar smells like a sub.  Rich Voss.  Yeah.  Oscar smells like purple onions. 
[02:54:30]  Like a number four.  Yeah.  I think Oscar is marketing his new line of cocaine.  Cocaine-laced subs.  Hey, every time you have a thought like that, punch yourself in the face.  That's a good one.  Thank you.  Where's your mom so I can smack her in the face?  And I think you're marketing his new line.  I think I'm going to punch your mom's pussy so it never happens again.  To cocaine subs.  What did you mean by that?  Yeah, explain it.  What, cocaine-laced subs?  Yeah, what do you mean?  Like, why is he marketing his own line of cocaine-laced subs? 
[02:55:00]  I don't get the joke.  He seems like someone that might have snuck something.  He's from Columbia.  There's been a lot of cases about sneaking this.  But why the cocaine sub?  I don't get it.  Yeah, we don't get it.  It was a Columbia joke.  Hey, listen.  Horton hears a who-ears.  Jesus Christ, what do you wear?  You don't want to get on Oscar's bad side?  Nothing.  Yeah, Oscar will fuck you up.  Right, Oscar?  Oscar gets mad.  Remember that little conversation we had outside?  Oh, shit.  I was just joking there, all right? 
[02:55:30]  Oh, really?  I failed to see the comedy in that.  I was just joking.  Oh, wow, Oscar.  You failed at this game, so now you want to beat up the mentally?  He was talking shit about me before I came into the room.  So was everybody else?  I didn't say anything about you.  No, and I sat down, and then you said, no, nothing.  I wasn't saying nothing.  Oh, he was-  I said, hey, you want me to take you up the back, man, all right?  I didn't say anything about you.  No, well, we're on 848 or 49th.  There's no alley.  We're the whole-  What happened?  Bobo said it. 
[02:56:00]  I didn't say anything.  Someone said-  Take it out the window.  Someone had said I said something, but I didn't say anything.  You know what?  I'm not going to put up with this shit with this retard.  Oh, damn.  Damn.  Bring in Voss in the mix.  Wow.  Bobo, what do you got?  Fucking Jennifer Aniston.  What do you got to say to that?  That's not cool.  Don't stick up for your retardation.  Yeah.  I don't know who the heck heard this-  Language.  That I said something, but I didn't say anything about you.  You sure about that, man?  Because you know, I was-  I'm sure about it.  You were being really sketchy in there, man. 
[02:56:30]  I am very sure about it.  No, man.  I don't think so, man.  Dave's not here, man.  I was just laughing because I knew someone was trying to stir something up and make up  some rumor.  You just made a Colombian joke about it.  He did.  He did.  That was only a joke.  You don't rank out a guy's heritage like that.  Sometimes jokes hurt.  Ask Imus.  You said all Colombians deal coke and kidnap people.  That's all they do.  I didn't say all of them.  Subs.  I said some of them.  You know why?  You're holding your hands.  You're nervous, man.  I mean, something's up, man.  Yeah, you're wringing your hands together. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, what's that about, Bobo?  Why are you nervous?  No, I just have a habit.  Big fat Colombian threatening them.  I just have a habit of doing it.  You ever have a Colombian necktie?  Holy shit.  That's right.  You know what a Colombian necktie is, Bobo?  That's right.  It's when a piece of rope.  Slits your throat, and then pulls your tongue through the slit in your neck.  It's called the Colombian necktie.  And then I'll be wearing a suit with it, though.  Oh, no, Chip.  Fucking Chip.  I hate Chip, Anthony.  I hate him.  Colombian dress shoes.  All right.  Jesus.  All right. 
[02:57:30]  Let's play another round.  Technically, it's Bobo's turn to go after Bobby.  I don't know him.  Kenny's here.  Yeah.  What happened?  Kenny's here just to make sure everything's all right with his curtain pants.  Kenny says, Bobby.  He fucking leave Black Holiday and Express drapes slacks alone.  He has blackout curtain slacks.  It's these pants for you. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, fuck.  All right.  Where are we at, Sam?  I grew up behind the iron Kenny's pants.  Jane, these pants was my favorite on Saturday Night Live.  See?  It's these pants for you.  Oh, you just did that one.  Yes, I did.  But I did it from a Bugs Bunny cartoon.  I don't care what you ducked into your teeth.  No, they're new. 
[02:58:30]  You can't get it through my teeth.  What?  All right.  Dick Dunlap eyes.  Dunlap?  It's an old reference.  Of course, it is.  It's a good one.  It's not a good one.  Do you know what it is?  Yes.  No.  All right.  Let's do another round.  All right, Sam.  It's Bobo's turn to give Bob Kelly hints.  Okay.  Handjobs?  Hints.  Hints.  I'm winning.  Are you?  Yeah, because you went first.  Oh, shithead.  It's not over yet. 
[02:59:00]  I stopped keeping track of the score.  You went, then I went, then you went.  That's why you're winning.  It's like the Special Olympics.  Everyone wins.  Block the sun.  What is this?  That was that race.  Oh, God.  Who's going to take it?  Bobby, take your headphones off.  Bobby!  Bobby, let's go.  You're good at this.  Oh, okay.  Dude, can you close your legs, Voss?  I'm so you're old man nuts.  You're fucking cranky ass.  They hurt it.  They hurt it?  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.  Well, good to go.  All right.  Good to go, Bobby.  Good to go.  Okay.  All right.  Look, focus.  Look at my finger. 
[02:59:30]  Look at my finger over here.  Follow my finger.  Follow my finger.  All right.  Let's see.  Follow my finger.  All right.  Go ahead.  All right.  So we did Danny.  Keep going.  My brother.  Gay men.  Let's see.  Travis.  Midget hips.  Travis?  Yeah.  Fuck.  Beards.  Guys with beards.  Men with beards.  Guys with beards.  Guys who are beards.  Guys who have beards. 
[03:00:00]  D-boy.  Fucking people with no goals in life.  Hermits.  Come on.  Come on.  Hurry up.  Let's see.  My brother.  Your brother.  People that despise you.  People that have better than you.  People your mother is prouder of.  People that have raped you.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  Fucking Bobby. 
[03:00:30]  Reaching into his childhood and pulling that one out.  Jesus Christ.  Get that one way too quickly.  The neighbor.  People who sexually abuse you because you're really Spanish.  Sneaking into your room.  People who suck your car.  Hey guys.  We got Dana White on the phone.  Oh.  No.  All right.  We'll continue with the game though.  Yes.  Of course.  Dana White from the UFC.  UFC 118 in fucking Boston. 
[03:01:00]  Dana.  What's up guys?  Hey buddy.  We are so happy for you man.  You're finally in Boston doing the UFC thing.  Thanks man.  Me too.  I'm so pumped for this fight.  Yeah.  And it's a great card.  Oh.  It's great.  We got Bob Kelly in the studio that knows a lot about the UFC and Rich Voss.  I don't know anything.  Hey Dana.  How you doing?  You don't know anything about the UFC?  No.  I mean a little bit.  I know that black dude used to come in the studio.  You are a UFC.  An unfunny creep.  Oh.  I'm sorry.  You don't know about Randy Couture fighting?  Who?  This clown?  BJ Penn? 
[03:01:30]  He's fighting.  No.  He's fighting.  No.  I know he's not fighting BJ Penn, but then BJ's fighting too.  It's a great card.  Yeah.  Hey Dana, can I ask you a question?  This is Rob Kelly here.  What's up buddy?  Are you going to have at the press conference after the fight, are you going to have an interpreter  for James?  James Tony?  James Tony.  No shit.  Yeah.  Everybody's been asking that and want him subtitled and all the videos we've done on him.  Why does he speak so poorly?  He speaks English and on the countdown they had subtitles.  Yeah.  I know.  Why though?  Like he was a Brazilian fighter.  What's wrong with him?  I don't know. 
[03:02:00]  I don't know, man.  He mumbles.  Yeah.  Dumbo.  And of course you've got James Tony boxing Randy Couture.  Well, he's doing the boxing and then Randy can do whatever the fuck he wants, basically,  right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's been, we could say he's been dabbling in mixed martial arts.  Listen, believe me, you guys know the story.  This guy chased me around the country, literally going to cities that I was in, you know, calling  me all kinds of names, saying bad stuff about the UFC and the fighters and everything else.  James Tony picked a fight for himself and now he's got a fight tomorrow night. 
[03:02:30]  So, uh, you put him up against Randy Couture.  He's just going to teach him a lesson.  Couture, when this whole thing was going down, Couture called me and said, if this thing happens,  I want this James Tony.  I said, perfect.  So, uh, it, uh, it all worked out.  Being blind to this and, and I'm sorry, but, you know, but we have a good relationship with  Dana.  No, I know.  I'm saying, I know, but I'm asking you put the fights to get the way I hear this is that  he's putting the fights together, you know, Dana White. 
[03:03:00]  He's saying they called me and this and that.  Yeah.  He's the president of the fucking company.  Oh, okay.  This is the guy.  Yeah.  This is the guy.  He was a fighter though.  No, no, no.  He's the guy that drives him from the hotel in the van.  Oh, oh, he was just, he was.  Are you going to call us again?  No, I met him.  He was in studio.  He was in studio one.  A few times.  Yeah, I met him.  This is the president.  He's a friend of the show.  Oh, fuck.  Like the top guy.  He's the top man.  The top guy.  Yes.  And you mean he's above Rogan?  Yes.  Oh my God.  He's Rogan's boss. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, he's Rogan's boss.  And he likes pink berry with, uh, Fruity Pell.  Nice to meet you.  We know him personally.  Have you ever tried the mochi on the pink berry, Dana?  I have not.  Oh, you can please try mochi on the pink berries.  They don't have mochis in my pink berry.  I do the Dana White, which is the original with the Fruity Pebbles, but then I add a  little mochi.  Mochi balls.  Mochi balls, Dana.  Try the mochi balls.  I actually just tried the strawberries recently.  Very good.  Ugh.  Fuck strawberries.  They're too tart.  Mochi balls.  Mochi balls.  I used to take Taekwondo.  I'd like to get in a ring with somebody. 
[03:04:00]  We'd love you to.  We would love to see that.  Hey, Dana, can we actually...  Please set it up with Brock Lesnar, please.  Yeah, exactly.  Brock Lesnar, why would you have to go to him?  Yeah, exactly.  We want it to hurt as much as possible.  That's right, Bobby.  We're going to Dallas Stingley.  Right.  Yeah, go to the 145-pounders.  Anyway.  So this fight this weekend is...  I mean, it not only is the actual...  It's a co-main event, but BJ is fighting Frankie, which is the headline gig, but everybody's  really interested in the Couture-Tony fight, too. 
[03:04:30]  I mean, I wasn't that interested in it, to be honest with you, but in the last couple  of weeks, seeing the countdown and seeing that Tony, you know, James is actually really  preparing for this, it's actually getting interesting, because if he gets a piece of  Couture's chin, it could be over in two seconds.  That's the thing that's, you know, this fight, you know, stirred up a lot of interest in the  fact that James Tony has been, you know, one of the best boxers in boxing for a long  time.  And the guy hasn't really trained for a fight in years. 
[03:05:00]  You know, he just comes out and fights.  He took this serious.  He got in good shape.  I don't think anybody thought he would when he signed this deal, but he did.  And listen, you know, we all know what should happen.  I built a great card around this one fight, because Couture should come out.  Are you ready?  Are you ready?  Let's get it on.  Double leg against the fence.  Yeah.  Mashed.  I mean, that's literally what should happen.  But we'd all be ignorant to think that James Tony couldn't catch Randy Couture and knock 
[03:05:30]  him out, because he can.  Anything can happen in a fight.  But Randy has to just stay away from his punches.  Yeah, but you know what?  And just kick the shit out of him.  I think Randy Couture takes him out real early, man.  Yeah.  And it'll be fun to see.  Let's hope so.  And you've got Kenny Florian on.  I mean, you've got Kenny on there.  You've got Joe Luzon.  I mean, these are all Boston boys, too.  I mean, it's a great card.  Yeah, the card we built, the main event, Frankie Edgar and BJ Penn, you know, these are the  kind of fights that I like, because these two fought in Abu Dhabi.  You know, there was controversy over the decision. 
[03:06:00]  Well, they're both fired up.  These guys are both fighting.  Everybody's saying it was a fluke.  Frankie wants to prove it wasn't.  BJ wants to prove it was.  I love those kind of fights.  That fight's going to be a war.  But then we've got, like you said, Kenny Florian taking on Gray Maynard.  Oh, what a fight.  The winner of that fight gets the next title shot.  Yeah, Gray Maynard is a problem for any.  I mean, he's a problem.  Plus, he got kind of stepped over to get to the title.  He looks just angry.  I don't know Gray Maynard.  He's a badass.  What weight class?  He's a badass. 
[03:06:30]  55.  He's undefeated.  He's 10-0.  No kidding.  Taking on Kenny Florian.  Yeah, that's going to be a good fight.  And the fight that everybody thinks is going to be the fight of the night.  Marcus Davis versus Nate Diaz.  Oh, yeah, it's going to be great.  It's actually the fight that starts the night.  And I agree with everybody.  I think that is going to win the fight of the night.  Nate Diaz is no joke.  Him and his brother, Nick Diaz.  Nick fights actually in another company, which sucks.  I wish he fought for the UFC because they're two of my favorite fighters.  They're both brothers.  But they totally get gangster.  Like, you know, they're from the hood.  They're nasty.  Yeah, they're throwing gang signs at the end of the fight. 
[03:07:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're doing interviews and whipping out.  Yo, yo, yo, yo.  You want to see a fight, you get the brothers in the ring at the same time.  Or the cage, whatever.  Yeah, but it's a good fight.  I mean, but BJ, now he's coming in.  Like, my theory with BJ, if he comes in with abs, he's winning.  If he comes in with, like, you know, he's...  The thing is, you never know what BJ Penn is going to show up, man.  But I'm pretty confident I know which one's going to show up for this one because he's  upset about, you know, the controversial loss and losing the belt in Abu Dhabi. 
[03:07:30]  Well, I had a little issue with BJ Penn and Randy.  I've had some strife with a couple of these fighters.  You know, just a couple of physical altercations.  I mean, it was handled, but...  You took care of those boys.  It really is odd to be put in those positions.  Yeah.  I never tapped anything so quickly in my life.  Jimmy...  Oh, that's right.  Who was it?  Couture just choked you out recently?  He didn't even choke me out.  He just put his big man hands on my neck.  And I fucking, I tapped and BJ put me in an arm bar. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, Dane, I sent you the video a couple of days ago, but Jimmy lasted maybe, I don't  even think a second.  No, not a half, maybe two seconds.  Maybe two seconds.  It was amazing to watch.  I wanted to see what it felt like.  And Randy said afterwards that he barely put pressure on, too, and Jimmy was suffering.  Yeah, I just wanted to see what these guys, like, you know, because you watch it happen  to people all the time and then to see what it felt like.  And it's like, it really is a devastating position to be put in.  Oh, yeah, man.  Oh, yeah, man.  Let me tell you, you get out, that was when, you know, I'd been involved in boxing for years. 
[03:08:30]  And the first time I ever took a jiu-jitsu class and started to learn jiu-jitsu, I was  blown away by it.  It's pretty freaky, man, when you don't know what you're doing, when one of those guys  grabs onto you, it's amazing what they can do to you.  Why is James Toney doing this?  I mean, do you think that he's a guy who's not afraid of being embarrassed?  Or does he really think he's going to go in there and knock Randy Couture out?  He really does.  And what people don't realize is this started back in, like, 2002. 
[03:09:00]  Wow.  When we first bought the company, you know, when Tito Ortiz was, you know, the big name  in the UFC at that time, he came out and started talking all kinds of smack about the UFC and  Tito.  He wanted to fight one of these guys back then.  So, you know, this isn't anything new, Tony.  And let's be honest, too, guys.  There's been a lot of boxers who've talked a lot of smack over the years.  James Toney's the only one that's ever actually stepped up and come into fight.  Yeah, it really is odd.  It's almost like there's a lot riding on this fight because boxing is seeming to become 
[03:09:30]  less relevant, especially with younger guys.  Nobody is talking about boxing.  Occasionally, you'll hear about Pacquiao or Mayweather.  They don't talk about, like, UFC.  No, it's a fuck.  The UFC guys are the ones everybody is talking about.  And this is like, well, the boxer, the UFC guy.  This is actually a huge fight for perception.  But you know what's really unbelievable about the UFC is you guys make it accessible to everybody.  You can get it for free on Spike, on Versus.  You can pay for the big, big main events.  But even those you give away free. 
[03:10:00]  And even the press conferences.  I mean, boxing back in the day, the press conferences were great.  But when was the last time you saw a press conference for a big fight?  Never.  You have to find that shit.  They put it out there.  You can see it.  And the press conference, James Toney was hilarious at the press conference.  Very fan-friendly.  Very.  Yeah.  For example, today at the Boston Garden at 3 o'clock, it's free and open to the public.  They're going to be there.  And the place will be packed and rocking.  And the weigh-ins themselves are an event.  Oh, my God.  The weigh-ins are great.  You guys got Damon?  No, it's a fucking UFC. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, the weigh-ins.  The weigh-ins.  I thought they had the weigh-ins brothers were performing.  Can you send somebody here?  Do you have any UFC fighters in Brooklyn that can make it here to punch somebody in the face?  He just got his new teeth.  It would be great to see him knocked out first day.  Hey, is Boston-  The weigh-ins brothers were going to be here.  Yeah.  He likes it, though.  What the fuck?  Rich Voss.  Rich Voss.  Rich Voss.  Staying away.  He's actually a very funny comic.  Now, how's Boston treating you?  First time there.  What's that?  How's Boston treating you guys?  Oh, it's been awesome, man.  Yeah.  The coverage that we've had here from the Herald and the Globe and just the radio, the fans 
[03:11:00]  here are awesome, man.  It couldn't be better.  Where are we at with New York?  We're getting there, man.  We're getting there.  Come on.  Let's go.  Well, you know, we just got Ontario.  We can go do a fight in Toronto now.  Yeah, that's cool.  We got that one done.  When we go there, that'll be the biggest mixed martial arts event in North America.  That will break records.  And then we'll get New York done, too, and that'll be a big one for us, too.  At the Guard.  Who's fighting in Toronto?  Dude, I can't wait for that.  It's going to be ridiculous.  Who's fighting in Toronto? 
[03:11:30]  I don't know.  We haven't put it together.  Oh, you haven't?  Okay.  It's a little down the road.  We'll probably do the event there until, you know, probably April or May.  Yeah.  We got some time for Toronto.  Yeah, that's great, man.  So it's almost everywhere.  Just New York.  And is there any other place that they're working on to get it legalized?  Yeah.  Well, right now, once New York done, the United States is done, we got Canada done, and now  we're moving out in the rest of the world.  Well, a lot of people don't realize, right now, we're in a half a billion homes on television  worldwide.  Jesus. 
[03:12:00]  Things over the next couple of months, we'll be in over a billion homes.  Jesus.  Is New York the last place to be legal?  Pretty much.  Pretty much.  New York's the last place.  How embarrassing for New York.  New York's old school.  New York's old school.  It's a marketing town, unfortunately.  That's embarrassing, though.  It's time to move aside and let the UFC do its thing.  I don't know if I want you to expand so much, because then we're going to have a tough  time seeing you, Dana.  No.  All of a sudden, instead of playing Philly again, you're going to be playing, I don't  know, the Philippines or something.  Yeah, actually.  I can't wait to go to the Philippines, either. 
[03:12:30]  20, you said that you're joking, but it's big in the Philippines.  I'm not joking.  It is big everywhere.  Yeah, yeah.  We all remember the great fights that used to happen in the Philippines.  There's a lot of things big in the Philippines.  Yeah.  Why?  You were fighting?  Your boss was about to make a fat joke.  No.  I don't want...  I was watching this Full Contact the other night on Spike.  This dude fucked this other...  It was...  I felt bad for the other guy.  That's all I know.  Wow. 
[03:13:00]  It was good.  It was a good fight.  Dana.  Do you know who they were?  He's just a guest.  Just keep that in mind.  No, I'm just saying...  He won't be back the next time you call.  Wait, you didn't think that was important when he said,  I watched the fight where one guy fucked up the other guy.  Yeah.  It was good.  That tends to happen.  It's very, very specific.  It was a big fight.  Who was it?  Oh, fuck.  You know, you could gamble with the UFC, too, there, Rich.  It'd be good for you.  Hey, who's going to be at the expo today?  We got tons of guys down there from Chuck Liddell, Forrest Griffin, Vanderlei Silva. 
[03:13:30]  I mean, tons of fighters.  And then Ariani, our octagon girl, Shandella.  Kenda Perez.  I mean, everybody's down there today.  She's doing Playboy this year, right?  She is.  Ariani is going to be on the cover of November.  Is that going to be weird for you to see somebody you employ naked all over the bathroom floor?  Yes, I'm sure Dana's never seen those girls naked before.  It's going to be the first time.  That's how he auditions them.  Take your clothes off.  Yeah. 
[03:14:00]  That's a good laugh.  He auditions them the way he does fighters.  Now, we're going to roll around on a mat.  See what you got, right?  I want you to get me in a triangle for 20 minutes.  Were you a fighter before you bought the company?  Boxing.  I was involved in boxing, not mixed martial arts.  In Boston, too, right?  Back in the day.  Yeah.  Another Boston guy?  Yeah, he's from Boston.  He did Boston?  I didn't know you were a Boston guy.  You're originally from Vegas, right?  Yeah.  My family is from here, and I grew up here until I was in third grade, then we moved to Las Vegas, and then I came back here when I was 17 and lived here for like 10 years. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, and you did boxing, and then you got muscled up by the Irish mob, right?  That's right.  Now that you're back, do you get enough polled that they don't mess with you, or are they all in jail?  They're all gone now.  Oh, good.  Hey, Damian Maia, is Damian Maia on the main card?  I think he just got put on.  Oh, he did?  Okay, because you didn't mention him.  We have him listed versus Miranda.  I was just going to make sure he's on the main card.  That's right.  All right.  Yeah, Damian Maia, Joe Lazan, Kenny Florian, Gray Maynard, BJ Penn, Frankie Egger, you got a great tour tour. 
[03:15:00]  That's one thing you guys do.  You never put on just one good fight.  The whole card is just stacked.  I don't know how you do it.  I don't know how you do it.  Every pay-per-view I want to get, I can't afford it.  I watched online on my computer.  You can buy them online.  I actually did that in Vegas because there was nowhere to fuck.  I mean, in HD, there was nowhere to get.  Yeah.  So you found it online.  Yeah, it was fucking HD quality.  When are you going to get an iPad? 
[03:15:30]  When are you going to get the UFC iPad app so we can watch it on our iPad?  You can.  You can watch it on the iPad.  You can?  Yeah.  Yeah, but you don't have a, it's the iPhone app you use on the iPad.  You don't have an iPad specific app, do you?  I don't know.  Okay.  All right.  Let me.  Now you're getting real technical on me here.  Rich has another.  Rich has a question.  I want to question the case.  How can you and I work together in some way that you can make me money?  Because you seem like a real winner.  Do you ever use comics to open for the fights?  Because I've worked different types of venues. 
[03:16:00]  There's 16,000 people.  I don't care.  I've done, I hosted Woodstock and the crowd wouldn't be that hard.  You should let them open up a fight.  I'd love to see that.  The original one.  The original one.  Yeah, actually, it's funny you say that because, you know, Rogan is one of the commentators.  Yeah.  And Rogan, you know, Rogan travels with us on this thing.  Rogan will appear tonight in Boston.  He sells out any venue that he's in.  He sells out House of Blues.  He sells out everywhere he goes. 
[03:16:30]  He sells out.  Rogan's living it.  Rogan actually had a funny, really funny video on his podcast.  He had Ricky Schroeder on and he told a hilarious story where Ricky Schroeder told this story in his podcast where he was a little, this little black kid came over and he was playing with him and he started kissing him on the neck and he was giggling.  And he put him down.  He goes, all right, go ahead, little kid.  And then someone walked over to him.  It was like, he's he's 16.  He's the same age as you.  I was webster.  Yeah, came over. 
[03:17:00]  Probably been a lot funnier if we heard Rogan do it.  It wasn't Rogan.  It was the other guy.  You stupid.  Shut up.  You guys have podcasts.  We don't we're not talking podcasts.  We're talking big, big shit right now.  Rich Voss opening for a major fight.  That's what we're talking about.  I would love to see it.  I would love to see it.  I would, too.  I would love to see you just get ripped apart by UFC fans, booed, just booed and fucking smashed in the face by a chick with a fucking eagle tattoo on her back.  You're obsessed with eagle tattoos today. 
[03:17:30]  I know.  I just want one.  I just want to point that out.  What do you want, fried or baked?  Is the event so?  Oh, my God.  Don't take your headphones off.  Dana, this is the last show before vacation.  We're all just punchy.  We're really punchy.  Well, and kicking, too.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yes, that's ant rich.  He does fucking ant jokes.  Let's give the big plug because we're all excited.  First time in Boston for the UFC.  Yeah, congratulations, man.  Absolutely.  UFC Fan Expo is today to the John B. Haynes Convention Center. 
[03:18:00]  You can go to UFCfanexpo.com.  Now, that's different than what's open to the public or this is what's open to the public?  Yeah, no, that's open to the public.  And the weigh-ins are today, too, at 3 o'clock at the Boston Garden.  Okay, and can they get tickets at the door or only on UFCfanexpo.com?  Yeah, they can get them at the door.  Okay, that's, I guess, all day today.  And then UFC 118, tomorrow night live on pay-per-view from the – what's the TD Garden?  What's TD?  It's the Boston Garden.  They call it the TD.  It's a bank now.  Oh, the TD. 
[03:18:30]  But it's going to be – especially in Boston.  Boston fans are going to fucking rip their roof off the place.  Tomorrow night's going to be a – I wanted to go so bad.  I'm so annoyed I'm not going.  I wanted to go.  It's unbelievable.  Now I want to go.  It is.  It's going to be a fun night.  Guys, thanks for the support.  You guys are the best.  All right, buddy.  Have a good time in Boston.  We'll see you soon.  Yeah, Dana.  Thank you, man.  See you, man.  Pleasure.  Dana White, everyone.  That's so cool that it's finally on there, man.  It's fucking – it really is about time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, Boston's a great town to have UFC into.  Perfect.  It's a fucking fighting town, right? 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, it's great.  New York and Boston, Jersey.  You guys are off the phone.  Enough with the groveling.  Let's get back to the game.  Jesus Christ already, you fucking brown-nosing douchebags.  Brown-nosing what?  I'm a fan of UFC.  Oh, God forbid we try to be friends with a billionaire that can do something for us.  No, really?  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think it's beyond repair.  I think it's beyond repair.  He takes care of us.  He does?  Yes.  Yes.  We've been to a million UFC shows, and it's unbelievable.  Is this more of the fun you guys have together without me? 
[03:19:30]  I've never been invited.  You're not a fun guy.  You're just a cost.  Fucking, you're the type of guy that wouldn't even go get my tickets right now at Foxwoods.com  because you're a creep.  Oh, wow.  I would get him.  What is that?  Why wouldn't you do that?  What is that?  It's October 14 through 16.  That's not the issue here.  So what?  They went on sale 30 seconds ago.  30 seconds.  Big fucking deal.  Go get him.  It's up to you.  When you said to him, can you buy tickets at your door?  For my show tonight, not only can you buy tickets at your door, when I'm on stage,  when I'm on stage, you can still get tickets.  Oh, see, that's not good.  No, I don't know. 
[03:20:00]  No, you're going to do fine at Governors this weekend.  Yeah, sometimes you do good in some places.  Sometimes you do bad in places.  I mean, like in Vegas, you know, Labor Day weekend, I always do great.  It's going to be sold out at the Palms.  Yeah.  What is it, a 40-seater?  Sorry.  Why?  Don't be sorry to me.  I'm sorry to the listeners.  Fucking asshole.  That's who you owe an apology to.  All right, we'll break and maybe be back.  I don't know.  Yeah, we've got to finish the game.  Yeah, we should finish the game.  We've got Ira, too, to stop by and say hi. 
[03:20:30]  You guys are going on vacation, though.  You could just leave after this, right?  We probably could.  We probably could.  Let's go to breakfast.  Let's figure it out.  Stay there.  Me and you have something to do.  The Opie and Anthony Show on the virus.  Virus.  Sirius XM.  Welcome back to Norton and Friends. 
[03:21:00]  Oh, it's Norton and Friends.  Of course it is.  Yes.  Today, my guests are Anthony Comia.  Hi.  Rich Voss.  Bob Kelly and Opie are doing a little man-to-man comparing in the restroom.  I say I'd give Opie an inch over Bob.  Yeah?  I might give Bob.  No, I wouldn't give Bob a girth.  I'd give Bob a girth.  No.  I'd give Bob the girth.  No.  Over Opie.  Quick question.  I might give Opie the length, though. 
[03:21:30]  Did God happen?  Saying whose cock is bigger.  You were saying whose cock is bigger when you were comparing in the bathroom just now.  Oh, no.  I have so much shit in me, my kidney hurts.  That shit wouldn't hurt your kidney.  Yeah, it does.  Dr. Voss.  Hold it.  Dr. Voss has something to say.  Are you kidding me?  First of all, I was going for a joke, asshole.  Oh, I'm sorry.  But my kidney does fucking...  Will you stop apologizing?  I think there's so much shit that it's just wrapping around.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Say, Rich, you should have said, oh, well, you missed it.  No.  No.  What?  I'm doing a cleanse on Monday, though. 
[03:22:00]  Three-day cleanse.  Really?  Because I wouldn't call it three.  Oh, shit.  What is that?  Reticulitis.  Hey, the guy that did the video.  He'll have fluid build up.  Build up.  We use Coke Logic in our movie, but the guy that did the video or the cartoon of Opie and  I playing golf.  Right.  You know what I'm talking about?  Was that Coke Logic?  No, I don't know if that was Coke Logic.  I think it was Coke Logic.  I don't know if he did the one that we played golf, but the other guy, contact me at my email. 
[03:22:30]  Well, I think the matter has to be evacuated.  It would have to be drained.  You know what I'm saying?  Let's go home.  I just saw Ira outside.  He's fucking great.  Bring him in.  Well, Ira's going to finish up.  Not great.  All right, get Ira in there.  Ira's going to finish up Pyramid.  Fucking ear cancer.  You don't like Ira?  No.  I love Ira.  Ira.  I don't like him.  What am I eating?  I'll look at Bulbo's back in. 
[03:23:00]  What isn't he?  Ira.  Good morning, everybody.  Hi, Ira.  This is Ira.  Say hi to Rich Voss.  How you doing?  Really?  What's the matter, Rich?  What's wrong, Rich?  It's just over.  It's too much.  Hey, Rich.  Is it setting your tribe back a few months?  No, he's not.  It's just too much.  I was saying he is exactly what was on the propaganda posters Goebbels used to put around Berlin.  Achmed Dinejad wakes up at 3 in the morning with that face in his mind.  Hey, Bobo, how's your balls? 
[03:23:30]  How's your dick?  It's about the same as it's always been.  You don't have a dick.  Ira hates Bobo.  I love this.  You don't like Bobo?  Bobo.  Ira, what's the weather forecast?  Weather forecast is going to be around 80 degrees today.  84 degrees tomorrow.  And dog days of summer is with us all next week. 
[03:24:00]  What about the 90s?  What about the skies?  Skies, beautiful blue skies.  How long does it take to convert?  Beautiful blue skies.  How long does it take to convert?  You don't want to be a Jew anymore?  It's just fucking, you bring in the worst Jews possible.  Exactly.  You, him, him.  No, we don't.  No, we don't.  Oh, fuck.  Ira, what do you think of Bobo?  Bobo.  Bobo.  Bobo. 
[03:24:30]  What do you got to say about that, Bobo?  Well, hey, Ira, do you know what the weather is going to be on the north side of Chicago  on a Labor Day weekend?  Labor Day weekend?  It's going to be very, very cold in your balls.  Bobo.  He hates you.  I love him.  You got French balls?  Ira, do you think Bobo's good?  Bobo, Bobo, I don't know what to say.  Bobo, Bobo, Bobo.  It's that.  Bobo, what are you going to say for yourself? 
[03:25:00]  Now, for one thing, I'm a straight person.  I'm straight.  Are you gay or are you straight?  I said I'm straight.  I don't know about that.  No.  It's a little wet.  Now I'm straight.  Now I'm straight.  Come on, Bobo, defend yourself.  That's why you kicked off the show.  I'm straight, and I was only asking you to wet the weather because I was going to, I  might be there on Labor Day weekend.  Oh, I hope it's so cold that you'll have to put on your imbuff. 
[03:25:30]  Not here, bro.  In August, in the beginning of September, you expect freezing cold.  Yeah, I expect freezing cold.  Battle of the Wicks.  Where?  Where, Bobo?  In Chicago.  Now you've got to get him back.  I hope there isn't going to be any rain.  Ooh.  No rain in your, it's going to be very, very cold in your balls.  Oh.  Oh, he nailed you, Bobo.  I don't think it's ever being nailed you.  Only radio can find you.  It's not freezing. 
[03:26:00]  In your dick.  Say something back, Bobo.  I think probably my balls are more sweaty.  Oh, your balls.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.  Well, most of the day, I'm not in a happy area.  Wow, Bobo's comebacks are horrible.  By the way, Bobo, why didn't you shave all the way?  You missed a spot.  You missed a spot on your neck.  I rushed this point.  It was one of those days where the lighting wasn't working. 
[03:26:30]  Well, you need better lighting.  Yeah.  You need to shave your balls.  Put on more light.  Put on more light.  More light.  More light.  Right above the bathroom is where the upstairs neighbors use it.  All right.  We don't want to cut it off.  Put on more light.  Go where it's safe.  Oh, Bobo.  All right.  Can we finish Pyramid and get the fuck out and start our vacation?  I think we're done with Pyramid.  I think they can just fight these two.  Yeah.  Well, that's what we're hoping for, but it went nowhere. 
[03:27:00]  Fucking Voss just broke.  No way.  You're not used to your new teeth?  Plus, mouth has a fluid buildup.  Voss?  Yeah.  It needs to be drained.  Yeah.  He's got to put a drain in.  A lot of times, the saliva glands.  How big are your balls, Bobo?  Oh, you're fixated on Bobo's balls.  How big is your chin?  Why is that?  How big is your dick?  How is your dick off?  What did you do today? 
[03:27:30]  What did you do here today?  Today, I was on the Jay Thomas show.  And what did you do?  Everything.  Everything.  Like what?  Give me an example of what you did on Jay Thomas.  Different things.  You don't remember?  Jesus.  Yeah.  Talking about a lot of things.  Give me one thing you talked about on Jay Thomas this morning.  Oh, the sky was on dope. 
[03:28:00]  Who was on dope?  This guy was on dope.  Who was?  Are you carrying someone around, Rich?  What do you mean?  I'm thinking of the character of Bunch Bunny.  Would I throw him in the oven?  This guy would have been dope.  I would have had a contact high by now.  Oh, Bobo.  Oh, Bobo.  Oh, Bobo.  I'm going to use that coming back.  It probably would have sounded a lot different. 
[03:28:30]  Oh, Bobo.  Wow.  Bobo, you've got to fight for your place back on the show.  It would have sounded a lot different if supposedly, as he's saying, the sky was on dope.  If that was the case, Ira might sound a bit different.  That's a good one.  Wow, Bobo.  Bobo, these guys are taking your spot on the show, man, and that's all you've got?  You've got to fight for your life today.  Ira, I think there might be something you're smoking.  I think you're smoking to...  Oh, my God.  Look at this. 
[03:29:00]  Manhattan to Queens.  I don't believe this.  Did you end up smoking cock this morning?  Oh, no.  Oh, I did not.  Oh, no.  I was gay.  We all do it.  No one.  You're saying he's gay.  Ira, they're saying you're gay.  Bobo, Ira said you're gay.  Did one of your prostitutes you were with sneak a roof and all in your coffee this morning?  Oh, no.  Never.  Never.  Never. 
[03:29:30]  Wow.  That's bad.  Or was there an extra package in the last prostitute you had a business transaction with?  Never.  Never.  Never.  That's great.  Ira sucks.  Never.  Oh, boy.  Good stuff.  Ira, what do you got to say to Bobo?  Bobo.  Was your last prostitute lying about her medical history?  Oh, you know people go out with women at all?  Oh, Bobo.  Oh, great joke in your gay, Ira. 
[03:30:00]  That's good.  They're all great jokes from Bobo.  I've had about five over the course of my life.  Last week, Bobo, last week I brought up here two women.  Who do you bring up here?  Nobody.  Oh, see.  This is like Granite arguing with Marble.  That's funny.  You haven't...  Yeah.  Yeah.  You want proof of straight?  There have been many cases I've asked women out, but I've never...  I've got passed out on.  But I...  Because I'd rather go out with you, Bobo. 
[03:30:30]  They would rather go out with me.  Oh, man.  He's a ladies' man.  Hey, you want proof?  You could ask my mother.  Oh, wow.  Oh, shit.  He's a mama's boy.  Proof of what?  That a boot didn't always work?  You fucked your mother?  Yeah, that's sort of what he was saying.  Wow, you had sex with your mom, Bobo?  That's weird.  No, no, no.  I didn't.  You had sex with your mom, you're saying.  Why didn't you say your mama?  Your mama.  But you said you want proof, ask my mother, so it means you fucked your mother. 
[03:31:00]  Why'd you fuck your mother, Bobo?  It's just she's seen me ask women out.  You fucked your mother?  That's so wrong, Bobo.  No, my mother has seen me ask women out to prove I'm straight.  Why would you fucking do that with your mom?  I didn't do that.  Did you deep dick her?  I didn't do that.  That never happened.  Ira, you think Bobo had sex with his mom?  Oh, Bobo, Bobo.  Hey, he doesn't have sex with nobody.  Except his mom.  No, no, I never did. 
[03:31:30]  He's a mommy.  He's a mama's boy.  No, I never did.  I never did.  Bobby lumps us.  Rich, just go with it.  Bobby enjoys Ira.  And then he's just like, yeah.  I never did.  Yeah.  It's like watching one of Norton's characters come to life.  I know, it really is.  You tell everybody that, right?  No.  Oh, Chip.  Fuck, I hate Chip.  So now, Ira.  What?  Who was on drugs on the show this morning? 
[03:32:00]  Who was on drugs?  This guy from Colorado.  And what did he do?  He was on drugs.  He's on dope.  So what happened?  What made it exciting on the Jay Thomas show?  He likes dope.  Likes to smoke the weed.  Do you like weed?  Do you smoke dope?  No, I don't.  Do you drink alcohol?  Do weed.  I drink alcohol.  I drink wine sometimes.  Did you ever have drugs in your life, like back in the 40s?  The 40s?  Never.  Never whatsoever. 
[03:32:30]  I never had drugs.  How old a gentleman are you, Ira?  I'm going to guess 56.  How old a gentleman are you?  How old a gentleman am I?  I'm 66 years old.  That's a great frequency in New York, too.  Thank you.  Thank you.  What's the frequency, 66?  66.  WNBC.  That's right.  WNBC.  It used to be.  WNBC.  Now, BLS is that. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah, yeah.  66.  But it isn't WNBC anymore.  It's The Fan.  I'm fucking hypnotized by what he talks.  Doesn't it hypnotize?  Because his watch is like, The Fan.  It's because his tongue is so big in his mouth.  Yes.  So you talk about that.  What else happened on the Jay Thomas show?  A lot of different things.  Like what?  A lot of different things.

Ah.  Do you get paid when you go in the studio?  Do they pay you money?  Something.  Yes.  You get money?  Yeah.  I get money.  How the fuck did you get money?  We're not getting money.  What the fuck?  We don't get shit.  Jesus.  You give me a half-assed plug at the end. 
[03:34:30]  I know.  Jesus.  But he's on every day.  Jesus Christ.  What the fuck?  We don't even get a commercial during the fucking thing.  And we thought, here's something coffee and fucking what?  What happened?  Coffee and very, very good.  Shut up.  Shut up.  We're negotiating.  Very good.  What happened?  Which is what Bobby and I would like.  You're paying people off the streets.  What happened?  This is what Bobby and I would like.  What are you trying to say?  Every week at the end of the show, you plug where we're working.  Oh.  Like, you know, at the end of the show, you go.  Like Fox Sports October 14, 15, 16. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah, like Vegas on fucking Labor Day weekend when I'm going to be at the Palms.  Governors tonight and tomorrow.  Why did you do?  Like, at the end of the week, you guys should go.  At the end of the show every day, you go.  Bobby will be here.  Colin, Rich.  You know, friends in the show.  Just to throw it in at the end.  No.  It would help us.  It's great radio.  You know.  What the fuck?  No, I wouldn't be great.  Why do you think Levy left the other place?  You could say Howard.  You could say he's an alcoholic.  Ira.  Ira.  What are your plans for the weekend?

Hey, do you like karaoke?  I like karaoke.  Would you like to do some karaoke this weekend?  I would love to.  Do you like swimming in a pool?  Swimming in a pool.  That sounds wonderful.  You like being a target.  Do you have swim trucks?  Yes, I do.  Really?  Well, Anthony's having a karaoke pool party this weekend. 
[03:36:00]  You were more than invited.  All right.  I'll be in Long Island.  I'll be running over.  I don't think you've run in years.  We could play Warsaw Ghetto 1938.  You could play...  You could play...  You could play Oil Up the Pool.  You could play Oil Up the Pool.  You could play Oil Up the Pool.  That's way, way back.  You want to sing a song?  Oh, fuck.  Does he sing?

I love, I love, I love my little cowboy, little girl every day. 
[03:37:30]  Where are they party?  Every day of the year.  Where are you going to be this weekend, Norton?  Jim?  No, I'm digging Hitler back up.  Look, we want to leave a tent.  I work with them.  They insist that we stay here.  All right.  All right.  Get the fuck out of here.  All right, Ira.  Thank you.  Okay.  Thank you.  Have a good weekend, Ira.  Thank you.  You too.  Get the plugs in.  Have a good weekend.  Yes.  Enjoy it.  I hope to see you next week. 
[03:38:00]  If I don't, have a beautiful Labor Day weekend, everybody.  Thank you, Ira.  It's very kind of you.  Cover all the bases and say, have a beautiful life, too, while you're out of here.  That's kind.  And Bobo, I hope the train on your shirt hits you.  He seems like a nice guy.  Who, Bobo or Ira?  Ira's cool.  I like Ira.  Ira's a nice guy.  Thank you.  I like Ira.  He's got a beeper.  I like that he pulls his pants up to his nipples.  Huh? 
[03:38:30]  On the paper?  Oh, boy.  There you go.  Thank you.  Everybody.  Have a good weekend.  Now he's paid.  What do you need?  A blanket?  Now he's paid.  Thank you.  He's got to stuff it in his boots to keep his feet warm.  See you later, buddy.  Hey, Bobo.  Good job, son.  He just took a paper.  Oh, my God.  I thought when he first came in, because I feel horrible now, I thought he was just an  over-the-top character.  But he's...  No, that's him.  Yeah, because that's what Opie and Anthony's show does.  They hire characters to come in. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah.  Improv people to come in.  All right, now do the character.  He wasn't hired.  He stopped in.  I thought maybe he was just a character.  I don't know that he's mentally Bobo, and I feel bad that...  I don't know what he is.  Oh, I just unplugged something.  Can I clear something up?  Help us to show.  Yeah.  What did I unplug?  Your funny bone.  Jesus Christ.  What are you doing?  Funny bone.  I'm trying to unplug this.  Oh, shit.  I'm taking all my stuff out of this in case. 
[03:39:30]  Get unplugged this.  I want to just answer something.  Can I have this monitor?  To anybody speculating, it was really that I didn't like Jackie the Joke Man.  When was that?  Just a couple...  What are you talking about?  Let's just say if anybody happens to be speculating...  Don't speculate.  It's obvious that he didn't.  I happen to like Jackie very much.  Believe me, I'd tell you if I didn't.  Who got that vibe?  I'm just saying.  Maybe it was related to me that somebody might think...  Not in this room, of course.  That I don't like Jackie.  Who got that fucking vibe?  That's weird.  Whoever thought that... 
[03:40:00]  That was a great show yesterday.  I happen to enjoy hearing him...  Jackie was in yesterday?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I happen to enjoy hearing him very much.  I'm not a Stern fan.  It was interesting to hear that history.  So you couldn't be wronger.  I like Jackie very much.  That's weird.  Yeah.  And he made me laugh.  Jackie's great.  Jackie killed yesterday.  Yeah.  I wish she was here today.  It was real funny.  Damn.  Look at us just packing our shit up.  Holy shit.  We're doing the show as we pack.  Well, just in case. 
[03:40:30]  Why are you guys...  I'm taking my shit and going home.  Why are you taking a telephone, Opie?  I'm taking one on the computer.  Why are you taking the desk?  I'm taking the flat screen.  Yeah.  Why are you guys taking all the TVs and the rug and the lights?  How do you take this?  Do you hate him?  What's the matter?  Dude, what the fuck are you guys doing?  We're not going to be here.  Looks like this is the forever thing.  Take it out.  Yes.  Oh, fuck.  I might as well bring my stuff in.  What is this? 
[03:41:00]  It's a mouse.  Leave this?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  We're going on vacation.  For how long?  Vacation.  Vacation.  I love a good vacation.  It's going to be sunny all week.  Under clear skies.  90 degrees.  If that's a kid, tell him to run.  Whatever.  Anthony has big balls.  Big balls.  He's got no balls. 
[03:41:30]  Sam has a very twinkie face.  Sam is flaming gay.  Gay.  Very gay.  Sam's asshole has a mouth on it.  Yes, he likes the cocks.  Sam has soft lips to suck the jack.  Sam is a mulatto mongrel.  Sam has black people next.  Sam's hair looks like one of my dogs before I brought him to the groom. 
[03:42:00]  Shut the fuck up.  You are a spoiler of all things fun.  Two minutes over?  It's crazy.  I'm on vacation.  Jesus, you're packing like you're in Hiroshima.  All right.  They didn't pack in Hiroshima.  They died.  They died.  They got leaflets.  Plenty of time to pack when that fucking bomb was falling.  They're watching fucking leaflets drop.  Pack your whole family with a fucking dust and buster.  Those leaflets drop.  The leaflet said one, two, three, boom. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah.  The leaflet said put your fingers in your ears.  It's going to be a loud one.  And if you want to hear one, two, three, boom again, go to the Palms Labor Day weekend.  Oh.  Oh, Ray.  Someone's got a bomb?  He never bombs.  He never bombs.  Never.  Jem coming on.  Never kills.  When did I just work with you?  No, no, no.  Not too much.  Say it, Bubba.  Bubba wants to play one more round of pyramid.  All right, Bubba.  Go.  No, no.  I'm not going to say that.  I didn't say that.  Say it.  Bob can't guess if you don't give him the clue. 
[03:43:00]  Come on.  Give him clues.  All right.  Better not say it.  Say it.  Don't say it.  Come on.  Say it.  No, no.  That's a fucking lawsuit.  You've got to give him the clue.  Yeah, it's a lawsuit.  I just thought that it hurt.  No, no, no.  Say it.  You know.  Give him the clue.  Give him the clue.  All right.  I guess yours.  Huh?  Say it.  Say it.  I guess yours.  What?  Your.  Your what? 
[03:43:30]  Mom.  Your mom what?  Say it.  My box.  Say it all.  Oh, Bubba.  Oh.  I guess what you say when it's your last appearance.  I get tricked again.  I get tricked again.  Oh.  Oh, man.  I get tricked again.  I get out.  Oh, Jesus.  Jesus Christ.  I get tricked again.  Why would anybody like this show?  Why would anybody like it at all?  Nobody does.  We all hate it.  God, this is just the meanest fucking shit show ever. 
[03:44:00]  It really is.  It just sucks.  It's the negative.  Just assholes.  It's like the fucking Plasm and Ghostbusters 2.  It's just fucking negativity.  It's just evil.  I hope you just slam the door.  You know what?  Fuck this.  Let's get out of here.  Have a great holiday weekend on Labor Day.  Sunny skies.  And karaoke.  And karaoke and the pool.  Oh, I like the pool. 
[03:44:30]  And I want to say that I hope that everybody has a good vacation.  And safe trips.  And I want to confirm Norton does like Jackie Martin.  At Robert Kelly.  At Robert Kelly on Twitter.  Okay.  Yeah.  I'll see you.  Goodbye.  Bye.  Bye. 
[03:45:00]  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. </pre>
