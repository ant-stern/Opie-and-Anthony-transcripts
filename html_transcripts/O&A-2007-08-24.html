<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts discussing their controversial on-air personas and the pressure to be "nice," before transitioning to a segment about Sal's Cadillac, which was featured in Newsday.  They then announced their regular Friday segments: FU Friday, Point and Laugh Friday, Mispronunciation Friday, Air Guitar Friday, and Is Tom Alive Friday.  The hosts heavily promoted their upcoming Virus Show in New Jersey, highlighting strong ticket sales and recalling a past show with unusual weather conditions.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a difficult phone call with Ed, a Car Crash Comedy winner who backed out of opening for them, citing feelings of being a "middle-aged failure" and embarrassment.  Despite the hosts' attempts to persuade him, revealing his past appearance on *Last Comic Standing*, Ed claimed to be receiving threats, a claim the hosts dismissed.  As a consequence, they announced a new Car Crash Comedy competition in Philadelphia.

Further segments included updates on the ongoing "Is Tom Alive Friday" storyline, detailing Tom's recent hospitalization, a flooded toilet incident leading to his eviction, and his suicidal thoughts.  A call from Brooklyn Ace requesting tickets and discussing his wife's excessive spending followed.  The show also featured live music by Drew Boogie and announced upcoming guests Bob Saget and Mick Foley.  Other topics covered included the hosts' upcoming vacation, a book signing, and the WWE outfit sent to Sam, which he was to wear before Mick Foley fed him a meal.

Tom, the recurring character, called in multiple times throughout the show to discuss his eviction, hospitalization for chest pains (possibly stress-related), and suicidal ideation.  The hosts, while expressing some concern, also engaged in humorous banter regarding his situation.  Dave from Houston suggested Tom move in with Opie. Tom detailed his inadequate hospital visit and his doctor prescribing Valium for his chest pains. He mentioned creating a video about sarcoidosis pain management, prompting Opie to promise him a MacBook.  Tom's online presence (istomalive.com) was referenced.

The show also featured an extended bit involving Sam, the intern with unusual dietary habits, and the WWE outfit. This segment involved a humorous struggle to get him to put on the wrestling gear, with Mick Foley, in the studio, adding commentary and eventually helping to feed Sam a steak – a food Sam had never tried and vehemently rejected, leading to gagging and near vomiting.  Sam’s mother called in, expressing concern.  Bob Saget, also a guest in the studio, participated in the commentary.

A subsequent Car Crash Comedy segment featured aspiring comedians performing short sets, judged by the hosts, Mick Foley, Bob Saget, and Lewis Black.  Comedians' sets were "crashed" if their jokes were deemed unfunny. Hassan Madri emerged as the winner.  Drew Boogie provided additional musical interludes.

Another segment featured a discussion of the "Opie and Anthony Test Boundaries" comedy tour, featuring Bob Saget, Louis C.K., and Rich Voss, along with the hosts’ negative reaction to a NorthJersey.com article about it.  This was followed by a discussion about WWE gifts sent to Sam, including multiple t-shirts, a baby bottle (described as resembling a dildo), a popcorn and glass set, and SummerSlam tickets.  The debate over who should accompany Sam to SummerSlam—E-Rock or Sam's girlfriend, Jess—ensued.

A "Rap Wars" segment between Drew and Chemistry, judged by Bronx Johnny (who also reviewed porn), with Kenny as Butcher's hype man and Renee and Roland participating, was a highly chaotic and sexually explicit event with numerous interruptions and side conversations.  Louis C.K., initially a studio guest, left for a dentist appointment before the battle concluded.

The show concluded with a rap battle between Chemistry and Butcher, each with hype men.  The battle, judged by the hosts and Bronx Johnny, was characterized by profane insults, creative rhymes, technical difficulties, and frequent interruptions. Butcher was declared the winner, though the decision was debated. Drew Boogie acted as a DJ/hype man for this segment, and the show ended with further banter, insults, and announcements of future segments and vacation plans.  Throughout the broadcast, numerous references were made to other show segments and inside jokes.  Ultimately, Tom's status as "alive" was confirmed with a call from Tom himself, further detailing his health struggles and hospital experiences.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  In the world of radio shock jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their audience.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good. 
[00:00:30]  Go, screw.  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  I go into her room and there are panties on the floor.  Oh, you're getting creepy.  I had to pick up the panties and put them on.  I can't believe he said that.  He didn't know something. 
[00:01:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Catch up a baseball.  Oh, nice.  Oh, that was nice.  I didn't hit him hard enough.  Opie and Anthony.  Terry Schiavo, I loved you in the grudge.  Will you be doing more voiceover work?  This is the worst show I've done.  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  On the road.  Still not fixed.  Show on the road.  Row.  It's the Opie and Anthony Schiavo.  Good morning to everybody.  The Friday edition.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Sal was famous.  That's my favorite voice.  Yes, row.  He was all excited.  He called me up and goes, I'm on the cover of Newsday. 
[00:02:00]  Newsday.  He was, you know, Newsday has like their part two section last Saturday.  Yeah.  He mailed it to me.  You know, snail mail.  Yeah.  Why was he on the cover of part two of Newsday?  Well, they did a whole thing about people, you know, getting up there in age and their  cars.  Their fancy convertible cars.  So they had about five or so, six people with their cars and Sal was one of them that was 
[00:02:30]  featured because he's got one of them, you know, caddy.  What the hell is that?  The caddies, the ones built on like the bed bodies.  The new ones, the CTX?  Yeah.  It's like really nice.  Really powerful.  Really good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So Sal was very happy with that.  I'm in the newspaper room.  I was going to get caught in a sting.  Yeah, right?  Something.  Stings are never good. 
[00:03:00]  All right, we have lots to do today.  Of course, Sal is your mom's, you know, husband.  Mom's husband.  Husband.  Of course.  It's FU Friday.  It's Point and Laugh Friday.  It's Mispronunciation Friday.  It's Air Guitar Friday.  And it's also Is Tom Alive Friday.  Let's not forget about Tom.  We got a lot of things on Friday.  And we got an email from Tom's friend.  Information since last week, according to Tom's friend, Bill.  A long email. 
[00:03:30]  What Tom has been up to.  We're also doing Car Crash Comedy today.  The winner of Car Crash Comedy will open up the Virus Show tomorrow night at PNC out there  in Homedale, New Jersey.  Tickets still available through Ticketmaster.com.  I'm sure we're going to do some fine walk-up business tomorrow as well.  The show's selling like crazy.  We're over 10,000 tickets, but we might squeeze another 1,000 in there before showtime.  It's supposed to be good weather, too.  Yeah.  Last year when we played PNC, I think we had like 11,000 or 12,000 people there. 
[00:04:00]  And it kind of was a weird, rainy, off-and-on day.  Remember?  Yeah.  No.  You don't remember last year?  Why would I remember?  I can't believe it.  Because it's part of your life.  You should remember things.  A year ago.  You really don't remember?  There have been so many of these road shows and stuff.  I have no clue what the weather was on any given one.  I'm not the weirdo in this thing.  You are for remembering.  I do remember it because John Mayer was there the next night.  And I, for some reason, can't believe that's a year ago. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  And you don't remember we were signing after the show and we had to kind of give up on it  because the rain started coming down a little harder?  Hmm.  You were...  Wow!  By me.  You were, like, the last one to come in from the rain.  I'll remember an episode of friggin' My Mother the Car from 1960.  I know.  But last year?  Bah, sorry.  Ed's on the line.  The winner of Car Crash Comedy in Philly.  Ed.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's going on with you? 
[00:05:00]  Not much.  What's up?  Well, you've caused quite a bit of controversy the last few days.  Yeah, I know.  I've become public enemy number one in Philadelphia.  Yeah, well, let's get into this.  What happened?  You won Car Crash Comedy in Philly.  You were supposed to open up the Camden Show.  It's a very exciting thing for somebody that's not well-known in the comedy world.  And you're backing out.  Yeah, I know.  I am backing out.  I'm thinking you can probably get somebody, though, right?  Why are you backing out, Ed? 
[00:05:30]  I don't know.  I just think I've been a failure for so long that to go up and do this five-minute spot,  I think I'd be kind of embarrassed.  Why would you be embarrassed?  You would do very well.  Yeah, I know.  But it's just, I think it's a spot for a younger guy, somebody who's not a middle-aged failure.  That's, uh...  Dude, you're just making excuses because you're scared.  So why don't you...  I'm not scared.  I don't believe you.  There's no...  I'm doing a stand-up.  There's no stand-up going to pass up a chance to go on in front of six or seven or eight 
[00:06:00]  thousand people when you're out doing gigs for Scarpatti for 150 bucks.  Come on.  Stop it, dude.  Stop.  Stop with the middle-aged failure.  I feel like a failure.  It's all relative.  It doesn't matter.  It's who you are.  I feel like a failure.  A lot of us feel like failures.  Big deal.  That's why we go on stage.  Yeah.  I'm sure you can get a younger guy who would love to be excited, can't you?  Who cares about a young guy and stop acting like you're not excited to go on in front  of those people?  If you're willing to stand in a fucking firehouse in some... 
[00:06:30]  That's all right.  In South Jersey for the money we get for those, don't tell them you don't want to go on in  front of this many people.  What are you doing, man?  I just think it would be better if you got somebody else.  That's all.  Yeah, but what's the real reason?  Are you nervous about the whole thing?  No, I'm not scared at all.  I just think that after all this time, this isn't a spot for me, a five-minute warm-up spot.  And I just think it's better for somebody else.  What, do you think you're beyond it?  No, I don't think it's beyond it.  I just think it's a little embarrassing. 
[00:07:00]  I've been around so long, I should have done better than this.  I haven't, so...  You think that the fact that you are going on as a contest winner is a reflection that  you haven't done anything in the business?  Exactly.  It's like this guy isn't a real comic.  He's just a contest winner.  Really?  Well, I was on Last Comic Standing.  Here's a little bit for you.  I went on.  I was kind of embarrassed.  I'm like, I want to go on Last Comic Standing.  It's a competition.  I really don't want to do it.  I was depressed when we were off the radio.  I went on for two episodes.  I had to drop out.  And I kind of look back and go, why did I do that? 
[00:07:30]  But you know what?  That was a door into The Tonight Show because those guys booked Leno.  So I've gotten four Lenos out of doing that.  Had I not done that contest, which I didn't want to do, I wouldn't have gotten Leno.  So I got four Tonight Shows out of it, dude.  So stop with the embarrassment.  It's silly.  And why wouldn't you look at it as an opportunity to maybe get your name known?  How could it hurt, Ed, if you go up there and you kill for, you know, how much time?  Like 10 minutes, I think?  It's like a five to 10 minute spot.  Seton Smith did exactly that in Washington, D.C. 
[00:08:00]  Who?  Well, you say who, but we know who he is now.  And we invited him.  I was just kidding.  I wasn't there.  I didn't know that.  All right, exactly who.  He was like a local guy down in the D.C. area.  He does the improv on like a Sunday night in front of 12 people.  He did car crash comedy.  He killed.  And then he opened up the show.  And he did really well.  He held his own.  The crowd loved him.  And everyone is giving him props backstage.  And he called our show yesterday.  We invited him to come up to New York to sit in on our regular radio show. 
[00:08:30]  That's awesome.  So he went from, quote, contest winner to someone we know about.  That's awesome.  I don't really understand your logic.  It's a chance to get backstage and network with a lot of the people back there, the other comics.  You know, there's agents and dummies walking around backstage that you can talk to.  His ego is, Bob.  This is your ego.  It's all your stupid ego.  So you go on Kid Chris.  Do you get paid? 
[00:09:00]  Do you go on Kid Chris?  It's not my ego.  I don't have an ego, Jim.  I know I'm a failure.  I don't have an ego.  That's part of having an ego.  I'm such a big fan.  I believe you.  It's the ego in reverse.  It's all the same thing, dude.  It's the same monster.  So you get paid to go on Kid Chris?  No.  Well, why do you go on?  Because it's fun.  Well, then why wouldn't you do this?  Sounds like this would be a lot of fun.  It might be.  It might be.  You know, there's established comedians we said no to as far as this tour goes.  I'm sure there are.  You know, I mean, we handpicked all the comedians for this tour. 
[00:09:30]  You know, you're more than a contest winner.  We don't just give stage time to anybody.  Gino Bisconti was one of the guys who went out and did this in Philadelphia.  And I've taken Gino on the road with me.  I've paid him to work with me on the road before.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  I'm friends with Gino.  I know Gino.  All right.  So he's not just a contest enterer.  He's a buddy of mine.  Yeah, I know he is.  Look, I couldn't do it now even if I wanted to.  Well, well, then there you go.  Why couldn't you?  Because I'd be afraid to go over there of all the threats I've been getting. 
[00:10:00]  You're not going to threat.  You don't be afraid.  I'd be afraid to go over there.  Just admit you were frightened, dude.  That's all it is.  No, I'm not frightened.  I don't believe you.  I really don't.  And I'm not using reverse psychology on you.  I just don't believe you.  I'm a stand-up.  You're talking to another comic, dude.  I know what goes through our heads.  Okay.  All right.  So, wow, we didn't get much done with you, Ed.  I apologize for doing your contest.  I really shouldn't have done it in the first place. 
[00:10:30]  I apologize for that.  You don't have to apologize.  It was a good day of radio.  That's how we look at it.  And this, in a way, is good radio.  But then we'll move on.  We're going to do an extra day in Philly before the Camden show,  and we're going to find a new winner.  Cool.  How long are you doing comedy for?  Too long, Jim.  Too long.  Stop.  Just stop.  Not too long.  Too long.  Stop with the, I've been around for too long to be doing this stuff.  I just got to get out, guy.  You sound like that stupid old comic from the punch.  Stop. 
[00:11:00]  All right.  Stop with that excuse, crap.  You're really annoying, Jimmy.  Because it's phony.  I don't buy it, dude.  I'm in the same boat you are.  I'm the same guy.  No, you're a big success, Jim.  Oh, please.  So what?  What?  Because I've made a few better right turns or luckier breaks.  I was touring with Dice for a hundred bucks a gig.  Do you understand?  I went to Texas.  I was doing comedy for nine years for a hundred dollars.  Wow.  And it came into this.  So stop it.  Well, I didn't want to go.  I shouldn't go down there for a hundred bucks.  I should be beyond that. 
[00:11:30]  Stop.  It's silly.  How old is Ed?  41.  How old?  41.  41.  You're not 65.  I know.  It makes it sound like he's in his 60s.  You ever hear of Rodney Dangerfield?  I mean, Rodney Dangerfield wasn't even doing stand-up at 41 yet.  He started, then he dropped that and sold Aluminum Siding for 10 years and then came back into it.  You know Rodney's story.  So sell Aluminum Siding for a while.  You want to do Aluminum Siding.  I know.  Yeah.  So why don't you, I don't understand what you're talking about.  I just think that my time has passed. 
[00:12:00]  Well, it certainly has on this program.  Yeah, no kidding.  I'm tired of Ed.  We're just, yeah, we're tired of you.  We're just trying to, we're just trying to finish the storyline.  You weren't trashing us on Kid Chris, were you?  No.  All right.  Who said that?  I heard that you helped our dopey show by, you know, starting this whole controversy.  No, no, I said...  I also heard from people that you said that you wanted to get paid for your material. 
[00:12:30]  Did you really say that?  What?  That you think you should be paid to be on the show?  No, no, I didn't ask for money.  I said once I found out that it wasn't a paid spot, I passed.  But I didn't ask for money.  Is that why you're passing?  Because it's not a paid spot?  It's part of it, yeah.  Oh, just...  Oh, my God.  Goodbye, Ed.  Good luck to you in your stupid life.  Just languish where you are, stupid.  Goodbye.  End of that storyline.  Well, here's the deal.  For everybody listening on YSP in Philly, we were going to come down one day, the day 
[00:13:00]  before the Camden show, on September 15th.  Now we're doing two days.  We're going to do one day from the YSP studios, and I think that Friday, which would be September  14th, they're getting the details together.  We're going to a venue.  We're going to do our whole show live in front of, I don't know, 800 to 1,000 people,  hopefully, if we get a lot of people up early.  And then we're going to do car crash comedy all over again, and get a real winner, someone  that, you know...  Oh, that jerk off.  ...someone that understands an opportunity when they see one, and they will open up the 
[00:13:30]  last date of the virus tour on September 15th in Camden.  It's not a paid spot.  It's an honor.  Shut your face.  It's an honor.  It's a lie, dude.  It's a lie.  I go on in the city for free all the time, man.  If I do the comedy village in the village, I don't get paid for that.  I just go on.  Yeah.  You go out and do $50 sets, dude.  I've done them.  I've done a million of them.  You're being phony.  He had fun with this the last couple weeks, but now it's like, Ed who?  Trust me, Ed who? 
[00:14:00]  It's a great opportunity.  We move on with our show.  Than put his hand up.  What do you got, Than?  Yeah, Than would kill for that spot.  Oh, my God.  And you know what?  He's a pretty funny guy.  I'm not going to take that away from him, but man, he's just stupid.  What's up, Than?  In two seconds, I mean, I would take that.  For the money.  What?  For the money.  For it.  Yeah.  Nominal fee.  I have a pretty long rider as well that needs to be assessed.  But, I mean, it would be terrifying. 
[00:14:30]  It would be something you'd have to do because it's awesome and it's scary.  That's half the reason to do it is because it's.  I have no doubt the guy's just really, really scared.  I hate that.  I mean, Gino.  How old's Gino?  Gino's in his 30.  He's been touring with you, you know, many, many times.  Gino's in his 30s with his eyebrows down.  He has 50-year-old man hair.  And Gino's been traveling on his own doing comedy all over the country.  And he would love that spot.  I'm sure he's going to, like, try out again when we go down to Philly. 
[00:15:00]  I'm sure there's going to be a bunch of established comedians that are going to try out.  Because now it's an open call.  All you have to do is get down to Philly that September 14th, the day before the virus tour,  and try out in front of a live audience.  We'll do car crash comedy.  We'll find a real winner.  I can be paid for my material.  Should ya?  Yeah.  Should ya?  How much do you want for short joke number five?  That's part of it, he says.  Part of it.  That really annoyed me.  Well, now he can get paid doing whatever he does, his comedy in front of 15 people.  You know? 
[00:15:30]  Bye-bye.  What a dummy.  Does he think we're going to continue talking about him?  Doesn't he understand this is it?  It ends here?  Kid Chris will probably throw him on the air this afternoon to discuss his appearance on our show.  And guess what?  Then it's over for ya.  He's done.  Then we all just move on to the next bit that we want to do.  Goodbye.  There are guys in life that are just, I don't mind frightened men.  I don't mind people that are scared.  Scared.  But what I hate is someone who's being dishonest about it.  If it is just a matter of I'm being greedy and I should get paid to go on there, then just kill yourself. 
[00:16:00]  So he's not going to go in front of, I mean, we could get up to 10,000 people down there in Camden.  But, you know, people are coming in during that opening slot.  But easily 5,000, 6,000 people are already in their seats.  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  So what?  He wants $100, $150 to do, how much money could he possibly want for that?  I don't know.  What a dope.  Thousands.  Really?  Really, Ed.  You're a dope.  One of many dummies who doesn't go where you're supposed to go in the business because of what you do offstage. 
[00:16:30]  Your decision making.  There's plenty of them.  Good.  More room for you, Jimmy.  You don't understand.  And the people with courage.  I do love, in a way, that because it's like there's so many dummies in the business.  Yeah.  So many men, they're frightened men or they're lazy or they think there's little dumb things like that where they want money for something.  It's like you cluttering up the works.  Well, don't confuse the money thing.  I think people in general are just scared and they use that as an excuse. 
[00:17:00]  I watch people on radio as I was coming up.  You know, they're sitting in Rochester or something and they have an opportunity to move on to a bigger market and they just were too scared to do it.  So guess what?  They're still sitting in Rochester, New York.  Nothing against Rochester, New York.  But if you're in radio, unless you're Brother Wheeze, who's like just the king of Rochester, you want to move on to bigger and better markets.  Yeah.  And I saw it happen all the time with radio guys.  They don't want to leave.  They were just too scared. 
[00:17:30]  You know, they couldn't see the opportunity.  That was right in front of their face.  They're comfy.  They got a good gig.  Why not stay here?  Right.  Why go somewhere else where I might, you know, fail and get fired and have to look for another gig?  I started in Geneva, New York.  I had a cushy little radio job in Geneva.  I was bartending in Geneseo and then I had to give up all that.  And at the time, it was everything to me.  All that.  I gave up a kingdom.  Yeah, but you know what?  But to the point I'm trying to make, I gave up all that because back then it was everything. 
[00:18:00]  It really was everything to me.  I had a cushy job at the in-between.  I was bartending.  I had my radio job.  I loved living in a college town.  And I gave up all that to move to Rochester, you know, to do a little bit more in radio.  And then I got comfortable there.  Spuds Buckley?  No, it was before Spuds Buckley.  But then I got comfortable in Rochester and I remember talking to an engineer at CMF.  I'm like, man, I'm never leaving Rochester.  I love this city.  I love WCMF. 
[00:18:30]  I'm never leaving.  He looked at me.  I was just a kid.  I was like 24 years old.  He laughed at me.  He goes, you're never leaving Rochester.  You have no idea.  Maybe a pat on the ass, maybe.  A little touch.  Yeah, he goes, you have no idea, you know, what's ahead of you.  Of course you're leaving Rochester.  And he was right.  Then I moved on to Buffalo.  And then I got comfortable there.  And then guess what?  I moved back to Long Island.  That was a scary move.  Then I met Anthony.  Good for me.  And then we moved to Boston.  And then we messed up in Boston.  We moved to New York. 
[00:19:00]  I mean, you know.  And there we were.  Number one market.  And we decided, let's get out of here, too.  Right, right.  But the point I'm making, you know, all these steps at the time were huge.  Yeah.  Who knew how it was going to work out in the end?  To me, I was leaving my comfort zone.  Yeah, you don't know.  To move on because I did see the opportunity.  It was scary as hell, but I saw the opportunity.  You got to see the opportunity.  That's the whole thing.  You got to take those chances.  Some people like to just stay where they are. 
[00:19:30]  And again, I can almost accept that.  But it's a fear thing.  Yeah.  It's all about fear.  I don't like.  And that's why a lot of people never succeed.  They can't get over that.  Yes.  And I don't like when they won't acknowledge it.  The world needs ditch diggers, too, you know.  Right.  Just be a man.  Be honest.  And acknowledge it.  All right.  We got that out of the way.  Done.  Ed doesn't want to upset Kid Chris.  That's not true.  We had Kid Chris on our show yesterday.  Alan in Philly listening on YSP.  What's up, Alan?  Hey.  What's up, guys?  Yeah, that's what Ed keeps saying every time he's on the air.  He doesn't want to upset Chris. 
[00:20:00]  Chris is the one that found him.  Nah, Kid Chris is totally cool with it.  We had him on the show yesterday.  You know, even Kid Chris is laughing at him going, what a dummy this kid is.  And I call him a kid because he's not that mature when it comes to figuring out what an opportunity is.  What?  Oh, no.  So now Ed is.  Hold on, dude.  Now Ed's doing this phony loyalty thing.  Is that what he's telling himself?  Are you kidding me?  Kid Chris is loving it.  Kid Chris is loving it because he's getting exposure for his show through our show. 
[00:20:30]  We all love getting exposure through all the radio shows.  He's completely okay with it.  Kid Chris is fine with it.  Of course he is.  But that's an excuse.  Well.  I said, again, that's phony.  All right.  Let's now.  All right.  Once again, I say.  That's the worst caller ever.  I know.  Once again, I say good morning to Philly.  And we will be putting all the details together.  And we're going back down there for an extra day, which is fine with us because we love Philly.  We're back.  And we'll get a.  I can't get that out of my head.  And we'll get another last night.  And we'll get another car crash comedy winner for the Camden show. 
[00:21:00]  A hungry comic in Philly.  I'm sorry.  I stepped in.  That's all right.  A hungry comic in Philly.  Yeah.  Who isn't going to bitch out and try to find some reason that he can live with.  Well, you know, shut your mouth.  Just say, I'm scared.  I'm not scared.  I just didn't want some cash.  Really?  You're not scared?  You were nervous in the room in front of 80 people.  Yeah.  Stupid.  All right.  Here we go.  We got Drew Boogie in the house.  It's the day before vacation.  In the hizzy.  So we got Drew Boogie playing us in and out of spots live. 
[00:21:30]  We got omelets being made over there by.  I always forget your name.  The dude from Basil Tees.  Steve Farley.  Steve.  Steve Farley from Basil Tees.  Yes.  From Tom's River.  Basil Tees Brew Pub and Italian Grill.  1171 Hooper Avenue in Tom's River.  Hooper.  New Jersey.  Drew Boogie.  Play us out.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah. 
[00:22:00]  Red boy.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:22:30]  The sounds of Drew Boogie.  The sounds of E-Rock.  True. 
[00:23:00]  Taking E-Rock's sound, his screams.  Drew Boogie live in studio today.  It's Opie and Anthony.  That must mean one thing.  Vacation right around the corner.  Out of here for a little bit.  For a week.  Quick little week vacation.  That's right.  Right after the Virus Tour tomorrow night.  Virus show tomorrow night at the PNC.  Tickets still available.  It's going to be a great show tomorrow night.  Oh, yeah.  And then it's relaxation time. 
[00:23:30]  A little beach.  A little casino.  A little more casino.  Some beach.  Some banana drinks.  Beach.  Casino.  Just watch out for the back rooms down there in the Caribbean.  Fine.  You go away?  They run a, you know, they run a reputable gernt.  Well, great.  That's one of those.  I don't think they want you taking, you know, like a hundred large away from their tiny little  island.  Well, how do you get it out of the country?  Just be careful is what I'm saying.  Maybe lose on purpose. 
[00:24:00]  Really?  Just like, let's say you're up a hundred Gs.  Yeah, give them like 40 Gs back.  Get off.  That ain't happening.  I don't want, I don't want you in a back room somewhere.  Back room?  They're going to drag you into a back room.  No.  They're going to accuse you of card counting.  Card counting.  They're going to accuse you of having little, little, little tiny cameras somewhere.  No, no, no.  They're going to accuse you of marking the cards.  Something's going to happen. 
[00:24:30]  Hey, our phone number, 877-212-ON-A.  We got lots to do today.  We got Bob Saget coming in.  We got Mick Foley coming in.  Mick Foley is feeding Sam his steak and rice today, right?  Yep.  And E-Rock called me yesterday and said that the WWE sent some kind of outfit.  What?  Some kind of outfit.  What?  What happened?  Was that Sam saying what?  Yeah.  Sam, supposedly, this is all I know right now. 
[00:25:00]  They sent some kind of an outfit for you.  Why do I need an outfit?  Why don't you?  The WWE sent a special outfit.  E-Rock wants to just put the outfit in the bathroom.  And before Mick Foley feeds you the steak, you have to walk out wearing the outfit that the WWE provided.  I swear to God, it's the WWE provided.  It involves something with wrestling.  You can't just go out.  What are you, the Brooklyn brawler?  You're just going to go out in your jeans or something? 
[00:25:30]  Well, I'm not wrestling.  You got to have some kind of an outfit.  Well, I'm not wrestling.  I'm just eating stuff I don't want.  Wrestling.  Don't say wrestling.  But let Vince say wrestling.  You have to get into the storyline.  This is the storyline?  We got an outfit for you.  You're going to put it on.  You're going to put it on.  E-Rock, can you give us a hint?  What kind of outfit the WWE sent for Sam?  No, no.  This is something you have to see for yourself.  I really can't give any of it.  Can we take a peek right now? 
[00:26:00]  If you want to.  Yeah.  All right, Sam, leave this dude.  He'd have to leave.  Sam doesn't like this.  I know.  This is the first time Sam has really been a part of something more than holding the camera  and filming other people being degraded.  Right.  It's about time he gets himself in the barrel.  He's been here forever, and he just holds the camera and laughs at everybody.  All right.  E-Rock opening up the box from the WWE.  I don't know.  Now, who sent this?  Somebody from the WWE? 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  Apparently, Sam has a lot of fans from the corporate people over at WWE.  Okay.  Sure.  So, um, they came up with this idea that they thought, uh, since Sam likes to be part  of a storyline.  Don't blow it by saying it.  No, I'm not.  Okay.  They just felt he should dress the part.  All right.  Just, uh, show us, uh, what it is.  I don't even know if I want to see it.  I might want to be surprised.  You want to be surprised to see him in it?  Yeah, but my problem with that, Jimmy, is he's going to say, no way.  You better not cop out today.  Let me see.  Let's see.  You don't want to see it, Jimmy? 
[00:27:00]  He's a tripper.  Is it good?  I'll show you this much.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  What else?  I didn't look.  What?  What?  Oh, my God.  All right.  Yeah, I don't want to look either.  I just want to see him walk out in it.  Is it all in there, too.  Is it all in there?  It's all in there.  Steve's going to go.  Is it sexy?  It sure is.  All right.  Well, hopefully Sam will do the right thing and put the outfit that the WWE mailed to us 
[00:27:30]  were sent to us yesterday before McFoley feeds him steak and rice and sweet potato pie.  Was it sweet potato or what was it, Jimmy?  Is there sweet potato pie?  Oh, I would hope so.  He was supposed to have steak, rice, squash, summer squash, and sweet potato pie.  I don't eat sweet potato pie.  No, who does?  It's awful.  And for the people that aren't in on this bit, Sam has never had a piece of steak in 
[00:28:00]  his life.  No.  He doesn't like rice.  He can't eat rice.  And he's never had a summer squash.  He eats like an eight-year-old.  Right.  I like to make werewolf movies.  That made me laugh all day yesterday.  I am the werewolf.  Oh.  Is Tom Alive Friday?  Don't you know I'm still standing?  We got a dilemma with this Tom thing. 
[00:28:30]  It's creeping a lot of people out.  Is it?  Yeah.  Why is that still playing?  It's over here.  Oh, it's over there?  This bit is creeping a lot of people out.  Is Tom Alive?  Because it's downright depressing.  But what do we do?  We started this thing.  Hey, every week he's alive is a happy thing. 
[00:29:00]  True, true, true.  The doctors gave him seven years to live.  He's on year six, which, well, it's kind of getting there.  But every week he's alive is something happy.  It's not depressing.  Read the message boards.  Really?  People are like, God, is this depressing.  And then I ran into somebody, 10 of the show, like, oh, God, I love the show.  But that Tom thing, oh, my God, that's really depressing. 
[00:29:30]  They're not a fan.  By the way, if Tom makes it to September 15th, he's going to make his first public appearance,  as far as our show goes, on that stage for the ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Show.  Ooh.  I think he's going to sit on stage and all that.  But, well, I got an email from his friend Bill.  We're 40 minutes into the show.  No Tom, by the way, which makes us all very nervous.  Ooh.  Is Tom Alive?  Information since last week, according to Tom's friend Bill.  This is what Bill wrote. 
[00:30:00]  It all started with a flooded toilet.  Doesn't it always?  The second floor toilet next to his room, and primarily used by Tom, but open to all the  happy tenants of the rooming house, clogged and flooded the house.  Lives in a rooming house with a common bathroom?  That's the first depressing thing we learned about Tom today.  That's depressing.  All right.  Why don't we count how many depressing things are in this email, by the way?  That's one.  This destroyed the sheetrock and floors below.  The one woman in the house to freak to the landlord. 
[00:30:30]  What?  The one woman in the house freaked out, I guess, to the landlord.  He mistyped there.  We think she stopped the toilet.  Tom, not being home, came back to the house to this disaster.  After cleaning up, he was blamed for the flood.  This caused him to get upset, flaring up his saridosis.  Ew.  I know I spelled it wrong, this guy writes. 
[00:31:00]  And in turn, giving him chest pains.  Jeez, come on.  During this episode, his landlord gave him 30 days' notice to leave.  Oh, my God.  So, how can this day get better?  Off to the cardiac unit at Blank Blank Hospital in Bronxville.  He thinks the unit has been outsourced to India.  Well, that seems to be what's going on in hospitals.  Now it gets better. 
[00:31:30]  Due to his condition, he is on a full regimen of pain control.  This included methadone.  Yes, it is used on addicts, but it's also prescribed for pain and can be picked up from a pharmacy.  Typos all over this email.  Well, you know how his speech sounds on the phone.  His body movements are slowed by the pain meds and, along with his joint problems, gives him a junky look sometimes.  Well, whenever a new person asked what meds he was taking, he would tell them. 
[00:32:00]  They would follow up with, what clinic do you get your methadone from?  This drove him even more insane to the point he insulted his assigned doctor and country of origin.  This doctor also declared him free of an incurable sickness because the x-ray was clear.  His x-ray is like looking at a stormy sky.  I do not know who they switch with, but I feel bad for the other guy who has Tom's x-ray.  Oh, so they messed up the x-ray?  I think they switched that.  And they basically said that Tom is cured of his incurable sickness. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, how bad is this hospital?  All right, I got that.  Imagine just coming in and getting an x-ray of the duck looking at you in horror.  Anyway, this is pretty much his week.  One last thing.  His car has been declared unrepairable, homeless, sick, and a dead car.  Wonderful.  Signed, Tom's friend, Bill.  Can I add something?  Yeah.  Club Soda County.  Yeah.  I also got an email from his friend.  Yeah.  And he needs like a handicapped parking spot. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  So he can like bring them in the van and everything.  There's a million handicapped parking spots in the parking lot.  You know, they usually, in every parking lot, they accommodate handicapped people.  So there's my answer to your email.  Have a heart.  Are you mad?  No, it's like, you know, like all of a sudden he's like.  You're bothered because Tom's friend wants a handicapped spot so we can get Tom on stage at the Camden show. 
[00:33:30]  Not too many cripples come to our show.  I'm sure he'll get a good spot.  Oh, my God, Kenny.  Not many people with polio.  There'll be plenty of handicapped spots for you.  So he's thinking if a bunch of handicapped people come and take up all the handicapped spaces, he wants a handicapped spot for the handicapped spots.  Yeah.  He wants a little extra.  Yeah.  What else does he want?  The list you pretty much had and then the one extra thing he sent me is like, make sure you had a handicapped spot. 
[00:34:00]  And you'll be taken care of.  All right.  Well, Tom hasn't called yet, so.  No.  Hopefully, Tom will call and let us know that he is indeed alive.  All right.  We got Brooklyn Ace on the line.  Our phone number, 877-212-ON-A.  What's up, Brooklyn Ace?  Actually, I was calling to see if I could get tickets for tomorrow's show.  Brooklyn Ace, you're like a faithfulist in the show.  Why didn't you get your tickets before now?  This little problem called cash flow. 
[00:34:30]  And yes, Jimmy, you can abuse the shit out of me because I expect it from you.  Use dirty language, sir.  Why would I abuse you because you don't have money?  I might abuse you because you don't have money.  Why would we abuse you because you don't make a lot of money there, Brooklyn Ace?  Wow.  I did care.  Sorry about that.  No.  And why are you topless?  This is creepy.  They made your, like, pal talk screen larger, and I see you with your crazy beard and you're topless.  Yeah, I better at it.  Yeah, thank you.  Yeah, thanks. 
[00:35:00]  He blanked out the screen.  Blacked it out.  So what do you do that you don't have any money, Brooklyn Ace?  No, actually, it's not what I do.  It's called my wife is a pain in the butt and spends everything.  Oh, no.  I don't even think the ticket's that expensive.  On what?  Yeah, what does she spend your money on?  You ask me, you know that?  Tell me, because I can't figure it out.  Every time I turn around and come back with the check, I'm sitting here going, wait a minute,  where's all the money?  Oh, boy. 
[00:35:30]  You don't take care of your own funds, huh?  Nah, let her do it.  It makes life easier.  Yeah, it's a great idea.  You know what it is?  It makes life easier.  You're calling up for tickets because you can't afford them.  Yeah, it doesn't sound like she made it a lot easier.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Wow, you really sound like you're in a bad place.  Yeah, I'm thinking that my wife should have a different name that starts with a J lately.  Yeah, I hear you. 
[00:36:00]  Well, Tom, you're a faithful listener.  I'll give you a pair of tickets.  No problem.  All right, cool.  All right, we'll give you a pair.  I guess you just have to hold on to the line.  Wait, wait.  All right.  What happened?  If he can't afford tickets, how's he going to pay for the parking?  He's so angry.  Why are you angry today, Kenny?  You're in the parking, Kenny.  The parking.  Why are you angry, Kenny?  No, today's a beautiful day.  I'm just stating a fact.  He can't afford a ticket.  How is he going to pay for the parking?  How are you going to pay for the parking, Brooklyn Ace? 
[00:36:30]  I'll work it out.  You got to pay for parking?  How much is parking?  How much is parking?  I don't know.  That's how they get you.  I would say about it.  That's how they get you.  Brooklyn Ace, when we're tooling through the parking lot, if I find you, I'll just give  you the freaking parking money.  No problem.  That's how we handle that, Kenny.  A lot of people are saying they don't think there's paid parking at PNC for events like  that.  Maybe there isn't.  I don't know.  He doesn't even know.  What about the parking that might not be? 
[00:37:00]  And the gas and the tolls.  No, I just know, in the last show, you guys did the right thing and gave out free military  tickets and everything, and then the venue ripped off the military people by charging  them $6 apiece for parking.  Even if there was four in one car, they had to pay per person.  Yeah, I forgot about that.  Per person.  Some of the military guys got a hold of me in the parking lot.  They're like, man, thanks for the free tickets, but they got $6 apiece from us as we came  in here.  Oh, who charges by the person? 
[00:37:30]  By the person for a car.  You can't do that.  Well, supposedly that's what they were doing.  What venue?  In Virginia.  Nissan Pavilion.  That's what I was told.  If it's true, I don't know, to be honest with you, but that's what the military guys  told me.  They charged per person, the military guys coming in.  I could see charging the car.  Per one car.  Yeah, because it takes up one spot.  How would they know if it's military guys and they're trying to get a little extra money  from them?  Or were they doing this with everybody, $6 a person to get in?  I'm not sure.  Yeah, I wasn't really sure about the info I got. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, let's find out.  We should ask Pete.  Hey, are you looking at PalTalk right now?  Oh, God, what are you doing?  I really, I turned you off a while ago.  Why?  What's up?  All right.  Now, Lex just came up with a great line.  I don't want to be the bearer of bad news, but I don't know what I'm talking about.  That's true.  All right.  Well, Brooklyn, we'll give you a pair of tickets, okay?  Courtesy of Blades of Glory on DVD and stores everywhere, Tuesday, August 28th. 
[00:38:30]  Got to get that plug in.  All right?  Thanks.  Everything else is good with you?  Everything's cool.  Everything's cool.  He's sitting in the dark.  Look at him.  He's just sitting.  It looks like you're in a submarine.  And now he turned the light on for you.  Oh, turn the light off.  That room's depressing.  All right.  Thank you, Brooklyn Ace.  Now everyone's going to call for tickets.  Brooklyn Ace just called at the right time there.  What can I tell you?  Can I have tickets?  Hey, Jimmy, how was the book signing?  It was good.  We should have waited a week. 
[00:39:00]  I knew we should have because the Boston is twice as full next week because the students  are coming back.  Yeah.  We still did.  We still did nice.  But yeah, I prefer to have waited a week.  How was Toucher and Rich in Boston?  It was really great.  Those guys were fun to do, man.  Yeah.  It was a fun show.  They got a nice buzz up there.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  They're on BCN in what?  The afternoons?  I think I'm guessing Drive Time 37.  Yep.  And we went up and did the show.  And they have a bunch of guys in the studio.  It's a really fun vibe.  And you had to go up there with Kenny on a train, I heard?  Yeah, we slept.  And my publicist came up because her husband's brother is involved with BCN. 
[00:39:30]  So we just slept on a train.  Yeah.  Where did Kenny end up sleeping after?  I got up this morning.  I made up the guest room for him.  I kept a light on for him.  Kenny was supposed to crash at my place because rumor has it, not rumor, he told me that they  were going to get home from Boston really late and he was just going to sleep in his  car.  I'll sleep in the car.  And I got a nice guest room finally.  I'm living like a human being.  It's all a brand new bed, brand new sheets, brand new blankets, brand new everything brand 
[00:40:00]  new.  Yeah.  And washed.  Because I know he's a germ freak like everybody else around here.  And I left the light on for him, as they say, in some of those old commercials.  And I got up and of course the light was still on.  And Kenny did not take me up on his offer, on my offer.  And really, I do appreciate it because you have such a lovely estate and you deserve  to have such nice accommodations. 
[00:40:30]  But we spoke very late last night too, so I was concerned about you getting your beauty  sleep also.  I told you that I wouldn't even know if you came in the front door.  I know.  But James and I got home earlier than we expected because our driver from Boston was  an animal.  We got back from Boston in like three hours.  Are you kidding?  That guy was great.  Yeah.  Steve from Bayshore.  Kenny climbed up his magic beanstalk and slept in the clouds.  So where'd you sleep? 
[00:41:00]  I went home.  You went all the way home after dropping off Jimmy who lives right next to me?  It takes me a half hour.  I'm home in my own bed.  I got up, took a shower this morning.  Yeah, but that's another half hour home and another half hour back.  That would have been an extra hour of sleep.  Yeah, but we slept later today a little bit.  You're just dumb.  Wow.  Yeah, that's a given.  You're just dumb.  Yeah, everybody knows I'm big and stupid.  I'm never offering again.  You know that.  Oh.  Sleep in your stupid car.  Wow. 
[00:41:30]  Now you're...  No, I went home.  But you will next time.  All right.  Thank you.  You're just stupid.  I know.  All right.  Are you hurt that Kenny didn't accept your invitation?  Of course.  You hurt Obie's feelings.  Because Kenny takes care of us and I wanted to take care of him for once.  You do.  But this is the thing.  I'll get into it for a second.  Kenny doesn't know how to let people take care of him.  Right.  It's bizarre.  He always feels like he's a bother.  He jokes about it, but he's not joking that he's just the help. 
[00:42:00]  He wants to be treated like he's just the help.  And he doesn't want anyone to do anything nice for him.  Don't go out of your way.  Exactly.  And it's just bothersome.  Yeah.  It's annoying.  Hope's saying that he offered to...  As a friend, he offered to yourself.  He feels like you rejected his friendship in a way because he offered to...  Not even.  I think it goes a lot deeper.  I think Kenny just doesn't want people taking care of him for whatever reason.  Yeah.  I just don't want to impose.  See?  Like even the attention now is unwarranted.  See?  I don't deserve it. 
[00:42:30]  Why don't you just leave it as an open invite, Hope?  No.  Just like...  Sleep in a stupid car.  If next time, if you feel like it, you know, an open invite.  Yeah.  That's not from me.  Believe me.  I know.  No, me neither.  I was just the opposite.  I'm like, oh, Christ, you don't want to sleep on the couch.  I'm not going to bang my chicken.  I know.  See, that's why I don't want to cramp anybody's style.  I just picture waking up early in the morning and going downstairs and seeing like his little  boxer short butt sticking out from the refrigerator. 
[00:43:00]  What do you got?  You got any milk in here?  I'm like, just kind of running the joint as you're trying to leave for work.  It's like, yeah, it's in there somewhere, Kenny.  Yeah.  Who needs that vision?  Then he doesn't leave.  You come home high.  It's like Steven Wright on the couch and half-baked.  He's just there.  I'm thinking more like single white female.  He just like, all of a sudden he has the same hairstyle as me and he won't leave. 
[00:43:30]  Well, people are suggesting or wondering if you already had the sign made up that said  Kenny slept here in the room.  The Kenny room.  All right.  We got to take a break.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Still to come, we got Bob Saget coming in.  We got Mick Foley coming in to feed Sam some steak and rice.  And Sam better put on that outfit that the WWE sent us.  And what else?  Car Crash Comedy.  When are they supposed to arrive?  They're here.  They're ready.  They're ready.  Yep.  So why don't we do Car Crash Comedy next and get it over with? 
[00:44:00]  Why not?  I mean, is everyone ready to go?  All ready to go.  So we're not waiting for anyone.  Nope.  Let's do Car Crash Comedy next.  That sounds like a plan, right?  Please.  And we're still sitting around waiting for Tom to call us.  It's been an hour.  Yeah.  No phone call from Tom yet this fine Friday.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Drew Boogie live in studio.  Take us out, Drew.  Take us out, Drew. 
[00:44:30]  This is Rich Voss, VOS.  August 30th through September 2nd, Rich Voss, myself, will be at the Pittsburgh Improv. 
[00:45:00]  That would be August 30th through September 2nd, the Pittsburgh Improv.  Come on down.  For info, go, uh, who?  I don't really have them posted, but you can go to rich at richvoss.com.  No, no.  No, my website's richvoss.com or MySpace.  But I don't have any of these dates posted yet.  Maybe I'll do that this weekend.  If I could fly, I'd pick you up.  I'd take you into the night. 
[00:45:30]  And show you love like you've ever seen.  Ever seen.  Radio Shock Jock.  Opie and Anthony.  We're back.  And strong as ever.  We're back.  And we're better than ever. 
[00:46:00]  We're back.  Back.  Back.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Take that, Rotharmy.com.  Nice.  It's Opie and Anthony, and of course, Jim Norton.  We've been away for a long, long time.  True Boogie doing that live in studio for everybody today.  We're back.  Stupid Rotharmy.  Yuck. 
[00:46:30]  Meow.  Meow.  No, we're back.  We're back.  We're getting ready for Car Crash Comedy.  Up for grabs, the opening slot at tomorrow's show at the PNC.  Slot.  In Homedale, New Jersey.  Tickets still available.  Don't forget about the tailgating.  That's going to happen.  I don't know what's going on with the drinking in the parking lot.  I'm hearing they're banning it.  I'm hearing they're going to kind of look the other way as long as you're not overdoing  it.  I don't know what's going on because we're getting lots of email from people. 
[00:47:00]  Well, from what I've heard, you can tailgate.  They're allowing tailgating.  Right.  So use common sense.  Okay.  Yeah.  Just be.  I'm saying.  Use your best judgment.  Just be responsible.  Right.  And knowing our creepy listeners are going to start the whole day in a rest area again.  Remember last year?  Now I remember that.  Last year, the parking lot, what, opened at 4, 4.30, somewhere around there.  And that wasn't good enough for a lot of the O&A pests.  So they met in a rest area and started their tailgating. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  You got to love them.  Threw a hole drilled up.  You got to love our listeners.  Between the stalls.  So Car Crash Comedy is about to begin, but I think we got to get a Is Tom Alive update  here.  Is Tom Alive Friday.  On the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:48:00]  And we got to be honest with everyone, this was kind of a throwaway thing that happened  about three or four Fridays ago.  Yeah.  And now we're stuck with this thing.  This Is Tom Alive bit.  Kind of liking the little guy.  Yeah. 
[00:48:30]  We're getting to know him.  Now we're in a little too deep here.  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Yes.  Tom is alive.  Tom.  Tom.  Yes, I am alive.  How are you, Tom?  I had a very, very hectic week.  Actually, I spent the week in the hospital.  I had a heart attack one day.  Wait.  What?  Wait.  We've just read the email from your buddy Bill, I guess. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  And you had a heart attack this weekend?  When?  Or this week?  Monday.  Monday.  And it's Friday and what?  You got better?  Uh, I, no, I just left the hospital against medical advice.  The hospital, uh, I mean, I might as well have been in, uh, Bangladesh.  Really? 
[00:49:30]  Or, uh, or, or Bollywood.  Uh, there's more Indians there than, uh, in India.  Yeah.  And they...  Well, some Indians make fine doctors, though.  Yeah, a lot of them make fine doctors.  Oh, no.  Not the hospital you were at, though?  No?  No.  No.  They, they, they, they, they come up, they come across as making fine doctors, but, uh, 
[00:50:00]  you know, when a, when a doctor said she's been a doctor for 15 years and asked, uh, uh, where  do you get your, uh, methadone from?  What clinic?  And I'm like, clinic?  I go to the pharmacy, uh, with a prescription.  Uh, and, uh, she's like, uh, that's, that's weird lying to me, because that's not how it's 
[00:50:30]  done.  I've been a doctor for 15 years, and I've never heard of such a thing.  Well, maybe if you're a heroin addict, then you go to the clinic, the methadone clinic  and get it, but in your case, you use it for pain management?  Yeah, it's, they switch me to it, and it's used for pain, uh, and as long as it's used  for pain, and it's prescribed by a pain specialist, uh, the prescription just has to say, uh, my 
[00:51:00]  name, and, uh, uh, for pain management.  Tom doesn't sound as sharp as he has in, uh, in past weeks, Tom, uh, is it the medication  you're on?  Uh, I, I, I'm not even, I haven't taken it, I haven't taken it today.  Yeah, your speech is a little off.  They cut me, they cut, they cut me off.  Oh, they did? 
[00:51:30]  Uh, they, yeah, they, they, they, uh, the hospital, uh, once I, they heard methadone, they were  treating me with the utmost respect, but once I said the word medications and methadone,  they, they mistreated me.  I, but my pain management doctor is, uh, I gave them the names of all the doctors, and 
[00:52:00]  he's, uh, making a complaint to the New York State, and he says, uh, they're all gonna get,  uh, they're all gonna get in trouble if not lose their license.  All right, Tom, Tom, Tom, and, uh, oh boy, and so the rooming house, I'm in trouble focusing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, we didn't know you were in a, in a rooming house with others, and you  had a heart, you had a heart attack, uh, in the rooming house?  Uh, no, it's not a rooming house, it's, uh, it's a house, uh, I rent the top floor, and 
[00:52:30]  then, uh, the guy rents, uh, two bedrooms on the other side of the house on the bottom  floor.  Why can't you live on a, on, on the ground floor, by the way?  You have a tough time breathing.  Why are you going up and down stairs?  Uh, because, uh, it's the biggest area of the house. 
[00:53:00]  Hmm.  I, I wasn't gonna go the, you know, they showed me the-  He's deteriorating.  Hey, Tom, Tom, so what happened?  Yeah.  What happened?  Yeah.  What?  Uh, let's say, uh, my landlord, the stupid bone.  Uh, gave me a call from England, and said, I want you out of there in 30 days. 
[00:53:30]  Why does he want you out of there in 30 days?  Now we gotta find him a- this is getting too involved, man.  Uh, uh, like you said, uh, it, it, it, it, it, it, uh, uh, worst luck in the world, yes.  Wait, why does he want you out in 30 days?  Try to focus a little bit, Tom.  Well, he wants me out because, uh, I refused to, uh, pay for the damage in the kitchen. 
[00:54:00]  I said, I'd pay for half, but I wasn't even home when the toilet overflowed, and, uh...  So why are you paying for half of the damage that it, uh, caused?  Yeah, I wouldn't pay for anything.  So a toilet overflowed when you weren't even there, so someone was using this, uh, this,  uh, this toilet, right?  Everyone gets to use the same toilet?  He said, yeah, and he said the other two denied using it, so it must be my fault, uh, and, uh... 
[00:54:30]  So what, a lot of water came out of the toilet because it was clogged and, uh, messed up your  kitchen or something?  Uh, somebody, uh, clogged the toilet, uh, probably upstairs, probably downstairs toilet.  Okay.  And, uh, uh, the toilet was, uh, well, somehow running because he had some inferior guy come 
[00:55:00]  in here to fix some stuff, and the hot water is, uh, the cold water is getting hot water.  I am so hot.  The toilet's getting hot water.  Tom, can I ask you something?  Okay, are you there?  Are you there?  Okay, listen up.  What's, what's going on with you that's different now than last time we spoke to you?  Because you're really, you sound confused, and you're not really on, on track like you, 
[00:55:30]  you have been in past conversations.  Yeah.  Uh, I don't know.  I'm, uh, upset, and, uh, uh, a lot to get off, and a lot to do.  Uh, I, you know, I'm trying to do a couple things here at once.  You sound like you are on something, though, because you're, you're, you're slurring a little 
[00:56:00]  bit, and you're, uh, you're kind of...  I took a, I, I took a sleeping pill last night.  Uh, so you're still trying to wake up from that, right?  Uh, so, uh, yeah, probably.  Oh, boy.  Tom, you know, I'm worried because, uh, you know, we're on vacation next week, so we're  not, we're not getting an update for two weeks.  You think you got two more weeks?  We're not on vacation for two weeks, but by the time we roll around to the next Friday, 
[00:56:30]  it's gonna be a two-week period.  Do you think you got two weeks in you?  Uh, yeah, I think I do.  Yeah?  I think I do.  Yeah, uh, because I want to make it to, uh, September 15th.  Well.  Well, in Camden, you're gonna be on that stage with us.  Oh, God, that's what you're living for?  What, what, we gotta come up with something after that now.  Yeah.  We gotta have a reason for him to, to keep going on.  Well, we're gonna be throwing a Halloween party. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, we got a Halloween party.  Possibly in Boston, so maybe we, uh, we bring you up to Boston with us.  And go to Boston?  Uh, yeah, I have relatives up there.  All right, so you're invited to the Halloween party.  Jesus Christ, we're gonna have to keep coming up with stuff.  I know, what, what are we, who are we kidding?  We're really gonna make arrangements for him to come to Boston?  Look, can, can we acknowledge something?  We have to.  We'll be lucky if we get him credentials to come backstage at Camden.  True.  We're in a weird...  I can't help him.  Yeah, how's he supposed to get there? 
[00:57:30]  What's he gonna do, die?  All right, thanks, Kenny.  We're in a weird situation here, man.  This is like downer radio at its best.  Hey, you know, if you, if you, if you want to drop the bit, that's fine.  No, we don't want to drop the bit.  No, you look forward to it, Tom, I can tell.  It's turned into more than a bit, it's, you know...  Yeah, we're learning about, uh...  Your life here.  ...a lot of things.  We're learning there's some hospitals out there that are not as good as others, obviously.  Dave from Houston's got a good idea.  I don't see Dave from Houston.  I see Dave from Houston. 
[00:58:00]  I don't, I don't see...  Line three, Opie.  I don't, I don't see, I don't see it!  He's on line three.  Uh, Dave?  Hey, I'm here.  Good morning, guys.  Hey.  How you doing?  Uh, you got an idea for, uh, Tom?  Well, yeah, you know, Opie, you got that extra guest room we were talking about, the score  that's not being used.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Tom, uh, Tom can come down there and move in with you.  And you know what, Dave, let me follow that up with a great point.  Opie has an elevator.  Tommy wouldn't have to walk up steps.  Jimmy, the great point better be, when I'm not home, that you live right next door and 
[00:58:30]  that you could help out in this situation.  I hate you, David.  No, no, no, that's a great idea.  I hate you, David.  I'm jealous.  Tom, you want to watch?  Look, I gotta be honest with you, I'm a very generous person, but Club Soda Kenny blew  it for everyone.  Now I'm turning my guest room into, like, a media room.  That's it.  Or a, uh, meditation room with little, little rocks and little, little, like, store, uh,  store-bought, uh, waterfalls.  Waterfalls?  Ugh.  Some kind of water motif. 
[00:59:00]  How about...  Sorry, uh, uh, Tom, but Kenny wrecked it for everyone.  Are you afraid big duties Tom would clog you in the bowl?  Yeah.  We know it was you, Tom.  So, so, Tom, you didn't even...  I wasn't, I wasn't even home all day.  Well, Tom, you didn't even explain, so why did this lead to a heart attack?  And you were in the hospital pretty much, uh, the whole week.  Uh, I was, uh, really stressed out from, uh, this, uh, bone. 
[00:59:30]  Uh, and, uh, the more I thought about it, the more I got upset, uh, and, uh, I started  to feel some chest pains.  Oh, boy.  And, uh, uh, I called my doctor.  He said, take a Valium.  And, uh, and see if you can, you know, relax. 
[01:00:00]  So I did that, uh...  That was your doctor's advice to chest pains.  Doc, my, my, I'm going numb.  My chest hurts.  Have some chamomile tea.  Try to relax.  Maybe it'll just go away on its own.  No one wants to, no one wants to be responsible.  Simmer down, Tommy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Stop overacting.  And, uh...  Overreacting.  Ugh.  Tom.  And, uh...  Oh, my God. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, boy.  Is anyone still listening to this?  This is our last call.  I'm just wondering.  Oh, Tom.  Thumbs up or thumbs down?  Are people listening to this?  No, I...  All right, so the chest pains...  I have a bad feeling about you, Tom.  Yeah, the Valium, the nap, that didn't help, obviously.  Then what happened after that?  Uh, well, the chest pain got worse and worse.  And about 4 o'clock in the morning, it was, uh...  Uh, I couldn't stand it.  So, uh... 
[01:01:00]  I, uh...  I called the, uh...  Ambulance.  And, uh...  Shout-out to Empress Ambulance.  Shout-out.  He's doing shout-outs.  He does shout-outs to the ambulance.  The company that is rushing him to the hospital with chest pains.  Hey, shout-out to my boys.  Shout-out.  All right, go ahead, Tom.  They were pretty cool.  And, uh...  They were pretty cool. 
[01:01:30]  And, uh...  Oh, my God, Tom.  We're running out of time.  They took me to the closest hospital,  which is, like, the worst hospital in the world.  Yeah.  Uh, people are wheeled in the emergency room,  and most of the time, they're wheeled out the morgue.  All right, his sense of humor is coming back.  The guy, the guy, uh...  The guy was wheeling me down and goes, uh... 
[01:02:00]  Oh, here's the end of the line.  And I go, oh, don't tell me you took me to the morgue.  Uh, and, uh...  Wait, wait, wait.  Did he just repeat it?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, Tom.  He's true.  So, Tom, do we have to find you a new place to live now?  Uh, no, uh...  No, I'm going to find it.  Uh, the, uh... 
[01:02:30]  You know, that's my responsibility.  I'll take care of it.  All right, anything else you want to say this week?  Because we've got to move on.  Uh, I'm, uh...  Sorry I'm not, uh...  Doing too good there.  But, uh...  Hey, you know...  Maybe I'll bounce back.  And, uh...  You all have a great week.  All right, so we...  So we learned that, uh...  The landlord wants to kick Tom out. 
[01:03:00]  Tom had a heart attack.  Um...  What else?  He clogs toilets.  You clogged toilets.  But you don't remember clogging toilets.  You're going to be at, uh...  The Camden Show.  The last, uh...  Date on our comedy tour.  Up on that stage.  He's a sleeping pill addict.  He likes sleeping pills.  Uh, the doctor wants you to take Valium for your chest pains.  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  Sorry, Tom.  I didn't mean to laugh.  Doc, my chest hurts.  I have a double shot latte, Tom.  And...  What else? 
[01:03:30]  What else?  There was something else.  Oh, oh, Tom, uh...  You're still thinking about, uh...  The gun and things?  Oh, yeah.  You're still thinking about the big ending?  Yeah, yeah.  Any closer to the big ending?  Uh...  When I go back for the same test they did at this hospital...  Yeah.  Uh, at Mount...  Uh, a city hospital that specializes in it.  Uh, I'll see what the real results are. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, boy.  I think there's also a website, istomalive.com.  They're giving updates.  This whole thing is making a life of its own.  No pun intended there, Tom.  Life of its own.  Yeah.  All right, Tom.  Well, just in case you don't know, Tom eventually said he will take his own life when it gets  too bad.  Well, he doesn't want to kind of just rot away or be a burden or, uh, you know, so, uh,  maybe live for another year, uh, incapacitated.  Right.  So, he's kind of making up his own mind. 
[01:04:30]  All right, Tom.  Take it one day at a time.  Anything else?  Uh, uh, yeah.  Uh, talk to me off air.  Oh, you want to get Ops' information so you know where to come to stay?  Yeah.  Get Ops' address.  What's that?  Well, why do you need to talk to us off air?  That's kind of creepy to us.  We like keeping it all on, uh, above the table here.  Uh, my gift.  Oh, that's right.  You didn't forget.  Now, did you? 
[01:05:00]  I got, I, I, I, I, I, I, I got to buy him a MacBook.  I forgot.  Oh, that's nice, Opie.  Because, because you're trying to.  I sent, I sent, I sent Steve the specs.  What the hell is going on here?  You sent Steve the specs?  Well, you need to feel like that.  I asked him if he needed anything that I would find it in my heart to maybe help out.  Better get next day shipping.  Well, yeah, no kidding.  Now, if I, all I ask, Tom, if I give you this MacBook, that you put me in your will so I can get it back. 
[01:05:30]  And then I'll give it to a relative or something in six months.  Six months.  Yeah, no, you get it back.  And what video are you trying to complete?  I forgot to ask you that last week.  He's trying to complete a video, and that's why he needs a MacBook.  Yeah, great for editing video.  Absolutely.  The video is about sarcoidosis pain management.  It's going to be a scream on YouTube.  I don't get it.  We'll add Benny Hill music to it to make it funny. 
[01:06:00]  Lung transplant.  And then there's a funny video about a cancer situation I once had.  Two weeks from now, I'll tell you more about it.  Maybe.  I hope so.  When I finish that, that one you can put up on your website for fun. 
[01:06:30]  We need a picture of you, Tom.  You've got to send a picture of you.  Oh, yeah, we do need a picture.  So we can humanize this a little bit.  Do you have a MySpace page?  Do you have a MySpace?  Actually, I am on foundrymusic.com.  Of course you are.  Oh, yeah, I'm sure.  Can we see you, or is there a big flaming cog over your face?  I'm sure Steve officially owns you at this point.  Who are we kidding?  I wanted to drive traffic.  Drive traffic.  Slow kettering.  The organ donor community is an untapped market. 
[01:07:00]  Yes.  I wanted to drive traffic to colder toilets.  They're unclogable.  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Oh, he's doing Steve White.  Of course he is.  How do we find you on foundrymusic.com?  It's probably under Dr. Nash 7.  Dr. Nash 7.  Dr. Nash 7.  Dr. Nash 7.  We can see a picture of you.  Pop them up there.  Oh, this ought to take years and cost thousands of innocent lives trying to find this. 
[01:07:30]  That's not him.  No, you're not.  That's a sexy woman.  Yeah, you're not.  Are you a sexy woman?  You go as a sexy woman in your fantasy world?  No.  All right, we'll try to find your picture.  If we find it, we'll pass it along to everybody else.  All right, there you have it.  Tom's still alive.  If not, I'll send you a recent one.  All right, Tom.  Hang in there.  I mean, that one's from probably last year.  Oh, well, a lot of things.  Hey, Tom, we're not going to be here next Friday, so the next update's going to be two Fridays from now. 
[01:08:00]  So could you do me a favor and just say your mom's box for us?  My what?  Just say your mom's box.  My mom's box?  No, say your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Is Tom Alive Friday?  Don't you know I'm still standing? 
[01:08:30]  On the Opie and Anthony show.  Well, that was downright depressing today.  Learned a little more about Tom, though.  And not the upbeat Tom that we've heard in the past.  This, Tom, a little confused, a little slurred.  His ideas weren't really put together very well.  And we're going to tear down a wall today.  We're kind of stuck with this bit.  You can't just, like, throw this bit away. 
[01:09:00]  Because I think he lives for this bit now.  Yeah.  So maybe, I don't know, maybe we can make the updates a little shorter for everybody.  Just make it go away.  Make it go away.  This isn't exactly an intern in an elevator, Bish.  Can't we just pull the shade down and make it go away?  Just make it go away.  What were the coyote cartoons?  And the train is ready to hit you.  Yeah, just pull down the shade and it goes away.  All right.  We've got Drew Boogie playing live for us in studio.  On the way, it's Car Crash Comedy. 
[01:09:30]  And Bob Saget joins the program next.  But first, Drew Boogie on the Opie and Anthony show.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, your health doesn't allow.  Let me hear you say.  Let me, let me hear you say.  Say, say, say, say, say.  Say, say, say, say.  Say, say, say, say.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[01:10:30]  He is eating omelets thanks to what, Basil Tease and Tom's River?  Thank you, Basil Tease.  Great stuff.  Stephen Farley, executive chef, cooking up the omelets for everybody today. 
[01:11:00]  He's putting some steak.  He's doing something with the meat.  It looks really good.  Well, to all of us but one.  He's starting to prepare the steak that Sam's going to eat.  Ooh, Sam, look at that.  And McFoley's going to be feeding Sam the steak after Sam puts on the outfit that the  WWE sent for him today.  You getting excited there, Sam?  No.  Why would I put on an outfit?  Steve is trying to find sweet potato pie.  Nobody likes sweet potato pie. 
[01:11:30]  A lot of people do.  I particularly don't.  But a lot of people do.  It's a tremendously popular treat.  I still would give him an apple pie, too.  Give him two options.  I mean, look, if he's going to go through with it and eat steak and rice, he should have  a dessert option, being that he's a sweet boy.  And wear some ridiculous outfit, apparently, which that was not part of the original.  You're a fan of wrestling, though, right?  Yeah.  Now, they wear outfits.  Do you consider them ridiculous?  No, because they're wrestling.  Yeah, but WWE sent it, especially for you. 
[01:12:00]  They're way into this bit, by the way, up there in staff.  You know, a wrestler coming in.  Yeah.  Well, I don't think he's going to be wearing, like, a Mankind mask and his Dude Love t-shirt.  But he did.  When he was wrestling.  Dude Love.  God, what an awful character that was.  I liked it.  What was it called?  Dude Love.  When he was Dude Love.  Yeah, it was.  We should introduce Bob Saget as well.  Bob probably.  Bob's eating.  Bob doesn't know what the hell's going on here, but basically, Sam doesn't like many foods.  Grown-up food. 
[01:12:30]  He doesn't like grown-up food.  He's never had steak in his life, and we're going to make a really nice-  Mankind, look!  There he is.  Speak of the devil, Mankind.  Get on the couch there.  How are you doing?  What are you doing?  On the couch?  Yeah.  Dude Love.  We were just talking about Dude Love.  Dude Love was my least favorite Mick Foley character.  Me too, but you don't have to make it so public.  That Dude Love.  It wasn't like walking down the hall and hearing someone you think is a friend dogging you,  man.  I'm sorry, Mick.  It was just, I remember watching, though, and it was like, oh, here comes Dude Love. 
[01:13:00]  And they do some groovy camera work with you, and it was very-  They did.  They had me flying.  Yeah, yeah.  Flying through the thing.  The whole theme song only had two or three words.  Yeah.  Dude Love.  Dude Love.  Dude Love Baby.  So they did.  Yeah.  But I'm on record as saying, when they first made me Dude Love, you know, that was like  the realization of a dream.  I remember getting a call back when I lived in Florida, and it was like 7 in the morning.  Vince had probably been up for three hours.  The guy sleeps like two hours a night. 
[01:13:30]  Hey, pal.  Hi, Vince.  How are you?  I probably look worse than I do today.  And he's like, how would you like to be Dude Love?  He'd heard about this character.  You're not going to be Dude Love!  Because it was like a thing I wanted to be when I was younger before I realized nature  where it didn't cooperate with me.  Is that it?  Yeah.  The Dude Love.  That's your theme, right?  When you were Dude Love?  Oh, God.  Somehow it was the disco hippie.  Yeah, what the hell was that?  Yeah, disco hippie.  But it was fun. 
[01:14:00]  When we originally did it, and I was Stone Cold Surprise Partner, it was fun.  That was like in July.  We call it the Summer of Love.  But I came to the realization that when I was dancing in Dubai in November, trying to kill  time so I didn't have to actually wrestle Jim Neidhart, I was like, man, this has gotten  really old.  So, yeah, it is one of those things.  Somebody asked me, he said, weren't you three characters?  I said, yeah.  He goes, you were Mankind and Cactus Jack and what was that other one? 
[01:14:30]  The other one.  I don't know, man.  You know, where you're wearing the tie-dye shirt.  You don't remember.  I'm not telling you.  People are requesting Angry Vince, but you could have told Vince you didn't want to be  Dude Love.  Well, I did.  I didn't know how bad it was going to be.  You know?  Mick, you're going to be Dude Love.  You hear me?  You're going to be it whether you want to or not.  Angry Vince.  That's a very good Angry Vince.  Oh, I love Angry Vince.  I love Angry Vince.  That's my favorite thing.  Put the tie-dye shirt on and put it on now. 
[01:15:00]  Or you're fired.  You're fired.  You know what my favorite thing Vince ever said to me?  You know, he managed to extend that fire into like eight syllables.  Yeah.  He wants it.  I think he was telling the truth.  You know, he thinks I'm a pretty good guy.  He goes, Mick, I have to tell you, as a human being, you're not bad.  But as a businessman, you suck.  Suck.  Suck.  Well, we're having problems with the bit there, Mick Follett. 
[01:15:30]  What's wrong?  Sam.  Well, the WWE, they were nice enough to send down an outfit for Sam's bit today.  We don't even know what this is.  Obi took a look and just started laughing his ass off.  Me and Jimmy and the rest of the guys, we don't know what this outfit is.  Sam, go into the bathroom and put on the outfit.  But here's the deal with Sam, also.  Sam is a little bastard.  Yeah.  Sam is the guy with the camera that is laughing all the time somebody else is getting crapped 
[01:16:00]  on on this show.  Laughs at everyone else.  He videotapes everyone.  He has never.  He's been here.  How long have you been with the show?  Well, I started interning like a little over two years.  A little over two years.  He has never been thrown under the bus at the brunt of our abuse or anything.  But he laughs and laughs when anyone else gets crapped on.  This is the first time we found something that he's a little, you know, you're a little  weird when it comes to your eating habits.  He's like an eight-year-old child.  He eats chicken fingers, fish sticks. 
[01:16:30]  Fish bakey.  Fish bakey.  French fries.  Do you eat French fries?  Yeah, I do.  Yeah, things like that.  Pizza, Elio's pizza.  And milk.  Is this all how your mother fed you?  Is that what this is about?  We had Sam's mom on the phone.  To try to get an understanding as to why he eats like an eight-year-old.  Were you breastfed?  No.  No.  My mother said I was allergic to her breasts.  Really?  Every time her bra came off, I broke out in hives.  Really?  No.  Still?  To this day.  Can I just say, for the record, there's something surreal about seeing Bob Saget behind the monitor. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, there he is.  Yeah, right there.  You're lucky I'm not in the back with a hacksaw and a woman doing scenes from very bad things.  An omelet kind of protects me right now.  We have that image of Bob Saget, you know, because obviously the wholesome TV shows you've done,  of just going the complete opposite end.  Now, if you've seen his stand-up.  Yes.  Very filthy.  Yes.  Very funny, but very dirty.  We wanted to go even further and just laugh as we see him dismembering a prostitute in a bathtub. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, I forgot about that.  As he just hacksawing a head off and making jokes about it.  Like, ha ha, this bitch is gone, right?  No, it'd be cute, innocent jokes.  It'd be really silly.  Yeah, she'll never get a head in life and just covered in blood, nude.  A real prostitute?  Yeah, wouldn't that be great?  Why not?  Or you could just get an actress.  It's the same thing, right?  Yeah, sure.  Some actress.  Two impalas and a couple ropes.  Just have them go in different directions. 
[01:18:00]  I'm just a bystander.  Yeah.  That would be fantastic.  It's like, wow.  Then I'd send it into Tom Bergeron.  Get him on the new show.  Yeah, boing.  You know, a boing sound effect.  Let's get Sam in the bathroom.  I agree.  Here's your outfit.  Who's filming?  Now, he has to put everything on that's in the box?  Yeah.  Yeah, everything on.  Don't come out until it's all on because I want the big reveal.  Look at Travis just laughing with the camera.  See?  It's not...  It hurts, doesn't it?  It's amazing.  Can I just point out that the poor diet hasn't seemed to have affected Sam's muscle mass. 
[01:18:30]  Apparently getting enough protein to maintain that...  Yeah.  Sam doesn't like being the center of attention, man.  You know, that's bad when I'm making fun of somebody's physique, right?  That's bad news.  Well, Sam's a slight guy.  He's, you know...  All right, Sam.  Why don't you go in there with the microphone and the big reveal.  You'll see what's in that box and then we'll get some kind of reaction from you as you go through the box.  Another fun fact about Sam, he is related to Thomas Jefferson.  Yeah, it's true. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, they trace back his family tree and he's related.  Now, from the hair, it does kind of...  The rumors about Thomas Jefferson perhaps having some lovers out in the slave house.  We still don't know about that.  No.  Because you do have the hair of an African American.  That I do.  Yeah.  But you're very white.  Yes.  Extremely white.  Right.  He could be the whitest black man.  I think we found him.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:19:30]  Now, that was just a little fun fact.  Don't try to put this off by elaborating.  He's miserable.  He is not like it.  He hates this stuff when it's him.  Yeah.  Oh, he hates it.  I can't wait to see his little wrestling outfit.  I want to see it.  Go in the bathroom with the box.  All right.  Look how happy Irock is.  Oh, Irock is smiling.  Oh, yeah.  Like he's got a jar full of mayonnaise and a tablespoon.  All right.  Sam is now in the bathroom.  The door is closed.  He's in front of the box.  What's the outcome of this? 
[01:20:00]  Does he have to do this at the virus thing tomorrow?  No.  Yeah, McFully is here just to feed him steak.  Yeah.  That's it.  Like he would feed like his own little kid or something.  To try to get him back into shape.  Yeah.  There's something.  Something happened when he was a kid.  Right.  That he's not.  He doesn't eat like an adult.  So to put him back in that atmosphere.  And Mick is a great dad.  He's written books and children's books and stuff.  So I think it's a good kind of father figure thing to maybe just take a couple of pieces of steak and fling it down his throat. 
[01:20:30]  And maybe cure him of this.  Is there rice too?  We have rice, right?  Yeah.  He hates the texture of rice.  So he's making it.  But I was told I could use force here.  Yes.  Oh, whatever you got to do, man.  Because I don't use actual force with my own children.  Sam's no child.  You've got carte blanche.  Force would mean it's like you're going to stuff a turkey.  Exactly.  Put it wherever you need to put it.  A wad of rice and steak down into the center of his stomach.  His mom tried forcing rice on him once because I guess she got really frustrated.  And squeezed his little red cheeks to open his mouth and shoved some rice in his mouth. 
[01:21:00]  And he promptly vomited all over the place.  This is when he was a kid.  Can I get like a rain slicker in that case?  Yeah.  There might be some projectile vomiting.  Hey, Sam.  How's it going in there?  You've got to be totally crazy.  See?  See?  Don't say it.  I don't know what this is.  You can hear it in his voice.  I just want to see it.  I haven't seen the outfit.  So I want to see wrestling Sam's outfit.  How far away from...  Wait.  He's coming out.  These won't fit. 
[01:21:30]  These are little kids' hot pants.  Oh.  Put them on.  Put them on.  Put them on.  Put them on.  They stretch.  They're going to fit one leg.  You're going to put those pants on.  And you're going to put them on now.  Our child-sized boxer briefs.  This is a jock strap.  What else is in the box?  There is child-sized underpants, and then an XL t-shirt.  Stretch the waistband on that.  Pull it.  See?  It stretches. 
[01:22:00]  Sure.  It'll fit you fine.  And then a towel, as if that's going to stay.  And flip-flops, a Triple H bib, and some...  So what seems to be the problem?  Yeah.  The WWE sent this stuff over, and you're going to put it on.  Absolutely.  These pants won't fit.  They will fit.  They'll fit.  They stretch.  They're stretchy pants.  You'll be terrific.  I've never seen...  Did you ever see anybody else complain this much about doing something?  Let me tell you something about spandex, my friend. 
[01:22:30]  Yes.  You know a little something about spandex there, Mick.  Yeah.  That's the reason I stopped wearing it.  That's a 300-pound mark.  It was true.  The Rock and I were up on top of the cage fighting it out.  It was this great dramatic scene.  But the lighting was such that when I turned, there were like 10,000 dimples in my ass.  And I just said, time for the sweatpants.  I thought it was just because you're on the fence in the cage for a while and pressed against it. 
[01:23:00]  No.  No?  It was just all natural?  Yeah, it's natural.  It's hideous.  Sam, you all right?  No.  Oh, he is so upset.  But Than has a good insight on Sam because you work with him.  Yes.  You do the Than and Sam show with him.  So you know a little bit more about him, his little quirks that he has.  He doesn't like this kind of attention.  No.  Sam, he can make fun of anybody.  If you go after him, he can take care of himself very well. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  But this kind of stuff where he has no defenses, the diet thing, it physically makes him nauseous.  And then you throw in one of his favorite people ever.  Yeah.  If we want to make this especially humiliating, do you want me to make him get dressed?  Do you want me to force him to put on the clothes?  If he refuses again, then we're going to have to force Mick Foley.  We'll have to force you into those clothes.  And Sam's a huge wrestling fan, by the way.  Oh, my God. 
[01:24:00]  That's his dilemma.  He's like, he gets to interact with Mick Foley, but he doesn't want to put on that.  But in a way, he absolutely doesn't want to.  Is this somehow similar, Bob, when someone sees you stand up and they're not aware of  what it is you do and they're expecting the...  Yeah, but I don't actually become a Nazi Geppetto and try to put Pinocchio shorts on them so  they cut off circulation in their baggage.  I'm just talking about the loss of innocence that...  Yes.  All right.  Yes.  That same feeling.  Okay.  Yeah, you've seen people get up and a couple of people have walked. 
[01:24:30]  In the past, they don't get it.  Yeah.  Perhaps they think they're going to see Danny Tanner.  A few years ago, that's when I did the dinner show.  Yeah.  If your picture's on the menu.  My goodness.  What's going on in there, Sam?  I'm trying to fit these...  This is children's clothing.  Atta boy.  Well, you're not much bigger.  You have anything on yet?  Yes.  Hey, by the way, where's the rest of the staff?  Is the entire staff coming in? 
[01:25:00]  Oh, boy.  Everybody should come in because this is like a team effort.  Yeah.  This is his worst nightmare.  He likes...  The thing is, he likes attention because he's been on the Than and Sam show.  He's, you know, he's Sam.  He wants that kind of attention, but he doesn't want it in this capacity.  No, not at all.  He wants to be...  He wants this day to end.  The guy that gets to make fun of everyone else.  Yeah.  But it was time.  Sam, you almost done?  Two years in the making.  Almost.  Oh, he's mad. 
[01:25:30]  He's climbing in an air vent.  There's no acting going on.  He's not happy.  We'll just watch Redrum take a shower while we wait for him to...  And we got...  Look at her ass.  There she is showering.  Oh, Nick, you better not look at that.  Do you know what?  Is that the Shining?  Don't look at that.  Is it...  No, it's the Shining?  That's live.  Who is that girl?  The Shining right now.  That's pal talk.  It's pal talk.  The girl's live right now.  Because you know, my four-year-old is going to trick-or-treat his Danny Torrance this year  from The Shining.  Oh, how adorable.  We watched it.  He came in the next day, and I woke up to my four-year-old. 
[01:26:00]  And he's got kind of that same Danny Torrance hair.  Yeah, yeah.  And I woke up to my four-year-old going, Redrum!  That's scary.  Redrum!  That's original, right?  Yeah.  It's great.  He's not here, Mr. Foley.  You got to trick-or-treat it a lot of high-rise buildings so the elevator can get the full  blood effect.  Here we go.  I guess Sam's ready for the big reveal, Sam.  Dun-dun-dun.  Yeah, it's going to be great.  All right.  Here comes Sam.  Here comes Sam.  Dun-dun-dun.  Dun-dun-dun. 
[01:26:30]  Well, you don't have everything on.  All right.  Well, he's got a towel.  You don't have the bib on.  You don't have the connection device.  This is...  The belt.  Well, tape it.  He looks like he lives on a kibbutz.  Triple A bib.  Okay.  He's got the belt.  This belt.  And look.  Look, it says Sam on it.  Aw.  They made a special belt for you, Sam.  May I point out that he's got the SummerSlam Biggest Party of the Summer t-shirt.  Yes.  The SummerSlam towel.  Coming to us on Sunday.  Yep.  Right?  Yep.  Our pay-per-view event from the... 
[01:27:00]  It's not the Meadowlands anymore, right?  I don't know the name anymore.  Continental Airlines Arena?  Whatever it is there, yeah.  The taping the Triple H bib on.  Thanks, Danny.  Aw.  And he's fine.  Look at Sam's face.  Oh, he is not happy.  Wow.  Sam.  He really isn't happy.  No, there's no faking.  This is ridiculous.  Oh, boy.  He is regretting the day his great-great-grandfather ever had his way with Sally Hemings.  Wow.  Oh, that Underground Railroad was a little too slow that day. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, E-Rock found something that Sam forgot.  What's that?  What'd you forget, Sam?  Sunglasses.  Oh, the sunglasses.  And now the belt.  You gotta put the belt on.  Yeah, put the Sam belt on.  Oh, you're just gonna carry it on your shoulder.  All right.  All right.  That's champion enough.  Maybe McFoley will sign some of this stuff for you.  Would you like that?  Yeah, sure.  Assuming, of course...  Wait a minute.  E-Rock raises...  I'm starting to interrupt you.  Eric raises a good point.  Eric, though, whispers what were the boxer shorts?  They're under the towel, stupid. 
[01:28:00]  I think Eric is saying that Sam should just be wearing...  Is that what you're implying?  I would concur, because right now he looks as if he could be spending a day at the beach  with a child's bib on.  But what we're doing is trying to convince Sam to strip down and do a pair of child's underpants.  What were they used in the show?  As Bob said, Pinocchio shorts.  Let's see if you can lie.  My underpants?  Yeah.  And here goes the towel.  You're gonna be real boring when this is over.  All right.  What did you... 
[01:28:30]  You left on your boxers and rolled up the legs?  No, you really do need to eat something, dude.  Look at this.  This is great.  Look at this.  This is great.  He's trying to downplay...  No, this is great.  Yeah.  It definitely is great.  I'm the champ.  He is so pissed, man.  Oh, he's not happy.  We better get Sam's mom on the phone, man, to calm you down.  Yeah.  After the break, you gonna eat some steak?  I just would love to.  All right.  Wow.  We got some rices ready, and we got some pit pie. 
[01:29:00]  Another fun fact about Sam, when he was a youngster, he was featured on Nickelodeon.  Yeah.  What was the show called?  Figure It Out.  Figure It Out.  Is that also about eating?  And figure It Out.  No, his race.  And what he did was he put a quarter on his ankle, and through some wacky double-jointedness,  he's able to pop his ankle, and the quarter went flying, and they measured it. 
[01:29:30]  He's got a special talent.  A mere little tot of how old?  I was like 12.  He was like 12 years old, and the same body.  Wow.  A little smaller.  Yeah?  All right.  He's smiling again.  We got a little smile on him.  And then I remember, oh, my legs are cold.  I wonder why.  I got my pants on.  I got no pants on.  He left his little undershorts on.  I know.  Little underpants.  Well, we got to take a break.  Bob Saget in studio.  Getting great reviews on your HBO special there, Bob.  I've been writing a lot of them. 
[01:30:00]  Whatever works.  And Bob, of course, will be at the show tomorrow night performing.  McFoley's going to be there tomorrow night at the PNC for the ONA Travel and Virus Comedy  Show.  Tickets still available.  Louis is doing it, too, right?  Jimmy, of course.  Louis C.K., right?  Louis Black, I think.  Oh, Louis Black.  Of course.  Yeah.  First date for Louis Black.  Yeah, I'd be happy to see Louis C.K.  It's going to be very, very cool.  We can't wait.  Scoop and Boss, Otto and George.  It's a great show.  Can't wait.  We got 10,000 tickets sold already, and we might have another, I don't know, 1,000 by tomorrow.  How many does that place hold?  Oh.  I don't know.  17?  17?  I mean, yeah.  Yeah, we're not selling out, but we're doing pretty well.  We broke the record last year for a comedy show, though. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  Which is good.  Biggest comedy show they ever did.  That's fantastic.  It's really been fun.  I've had a blast on this thing, and it's more fun hanging out.  I accidentally walked into Jim's dressing room.  I thought it was mine.  I was so glad he wasn't doing the deed.  If you understand what I was about to do.  Honestly, we were looking at Craigslist when he walked in, and if you know I was alone,  I was just going to start scrapping.  I walk in, Internet's there.  He lifts his head like he sensed some danger, but it was like, oh,  it's a good thing he came in now.  Yeah, he lifts his head like a zebra at a watering hole when they hear something. 
[01:31:00]  What the?  I actually smelled somebody.  Very wild Animal Park moment.  All right.  When we get back, Car Crash Comedy, and also Sam Eats Steak.  Not good.  Oh, good.  Oh, is he disgusted.  Yeah, we've got to give away a slot on the tour.  Yeah, we do.  For one of these, you know, comedians.  We got any names out there, or are they all like beginners?  Amateurs?  What do we got?  Mostly up-and-comers.  Mostly up-and-comers.  Open-micers?  Some open-micers? 
[01:31:30]  I recognize a face or two.  Oh, you do?  All right.  Let's see what happens next.  Drew Boogie spinning live in studio.  Drew, what do you got for us?  It's Opie and Anthony.  Chocolate rain.  Some stay dry and others feel the pain.  Chocolate rain.  Pizza rain. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, you're welcome.  We'll be right back. 
[01:32:30]  We've got a full house today.  We've got Bob Saget in studio.  His HBO special is going to debut.  I'm still dry heaving after you said that.  Wow.  We're doing today's show step by step.  Sorry about that.  I'm just hanging with Mr. Cooper today. 
[01:33:00]  You're done with that whole full house crap you don't want to ever hear mentioned again.  Everything but the royalty checks, right?  They turn into a dollar.  Really?  Yeah, you can buy coffee, creamer.  You've got to be an owner.  You've got to be an owner.  Well, your HBO special debuts while you're going to be on stage at the Virus Tour tomorrow night.  Yeah, it's really cool to me.  How cool is that?  It's getting great reviews.  Thank you, man.  New York Papers are writing about it today.  Gave you a full page in the TV section of, I think it was the Daily News.  Yeah, what?  Daily News.  Daily News.  Then we've got Mick Foley enjoying some egg whites. 
[01:33:30]  Egg whites?  No, regular eggs.  Mick doesn't ask me.  I don't know.  It looks kind of white from here.  No.  He's enjoying an omelet.  Sam looks kind of white from here, too.  Yeah.  It looks can be misleading.  Can I say how good this steak is, too?  I'm trying.  Oh, my God.  Right?  We're not giving Sam crabby food.  No.  This is a really good steak.  Mick, cut into a piece of steak to prove that it's a nice piece of steak.  How cool is it?  I do not like this.  It's a nice texture, ambiance.  Is Sam eating the steak?  Mm-hmm.  I'm going to write.  No, no.  We got, well, how are we going to do this? 
[01:34:00]  Sam's dressed and ready to go here.  He's got his bib on.  I wanted to talk to Sam's mom, but we couldn't get a hold of her.  Put him over there.  We'll call Sam.  Yeah, all right.  Sam, where do you want to sit?  Where do I want to sit?  Well, I don't know.  At home.  At home.  Oh, that's good stuff.  How could you not like this?  Oh, it's amazing.  Look at it.  Sam.  Yeah?  Take a look.  How could you not like that?  He doesn't know if he likes it.  He's never had it. 
[01:34:30]  It's not chicken.  It's not white.  It doesn't.  Oh.  Wonderful.  Everyone is enjoying the steak that Sam's going to eat any moment.  This is amazing.  All right.  Where is he going to sit?  We should sit on the couch together so we could feed him like a little baby.  It's like we're feeding him crap the way this is being set up.  It's such good stuff.  Sam's a big fan of Mick Foley, too.  I'll sit next to Mick.  And by the way, basil teas, the food is excellent.  We've got to make sure everyone understands that because I don't think Sam is going to  give the reaction of excellent food here. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  Gagging on a piece of steak is not the greatest endorsement for your restaurant.  That's why I have to say everyone else is really enjoying the food today.  Look at the big platter that Kenny has brought over.  Oh, man.  Look at that.  Oh, he just like cringed and shivered.  He's itching his leg already.  Oh, this is a garbage can.  He's got meat allergies.  You guys tell me.  When do you want this to proceed?  Well, we want to see a little show, Mick. 
[01:35:30]  Okay.  You know, you play a little airplane hanger.  That's what I do.  That's what I do.  Ready?  Just imagine the little kid.  All right.  Here we go.  Sam.  He's actually bringing a bucket over for him.  He'll be fine.  Sam.  This is the first time Sam, who's about 23, 24, is trying steak.  He doesn't eat burgers.  He doesn't eat steak.  No beef at all.  He's only eats chicken fingers and chicken nuggets and chicken and pizza.  All right.  Wait.  We got Sam's mom on the line.  Sam's mom.  Yeah.  Hi. 
[01:36:00]  It's finally going down.  We're going to feed Sam a piece of steak.  Mick Foley's cutting it up nice for him.  I hope you guys aren't doing any kind of mental or emotional damage to Sam by doing this.  No.  Yes.  We're being very sweet to Sam.  We are.  And we didn't do any switcheroo or anything.  He's eating the exact same steak that everyone else is enjoying.  With child-size underpants on.  Oh, yeah.  Mom, Sam has child-size underpants on.  But he left his boxers on.  It sounds like you guys might have already sort of psychologically damaged him by the clothes 
[01:36:30]  you've put on him.  Aw.  Well, it's the WWE.  They sent a box of stuff for this bit.  Yeah.  Well, then if it's the WWE, he can wear anything.  Thank you, Mom.  But he's got a bib with a skull on it.  He looks cute.  Yeah.  It's a Triple H bib.  That's tough.  I think Sam is shy as far as how big he is down below.  That's why he had to keep his boxer shorts on.  And a towel.  And a towel.  He's trying to cover up a world of goodness.  I was listening earlier when you guys sent him off to get dressed. 
[01:37:00]  It seemed to take him a while to get those clothes on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He didn't really want to do it.  Oh.  Okay.  So now, are you tying him down to a chair or what are you doing?  No, but that's a good idea.  That's the assumption.  Well, we told Mick Foley if he's not satisfied with Sam's eating habits, he can do whatever  it takes to make sure Sam eats the steak.  And Mick Foley, how much do you weigh these days?  Weighing close to three bills.  Three bills, Sam's mom. 
[01:37:30]  Okay.  That should be okay.  That should handle Sam, right?  I'm just under two.  Just under, huh?  Sam's mom.  What's your name?  What's my name?  Yes.  Bobby.  Bobby.  Bobby.  That's mine also.  Bobby.  It's Bob.  Yeah, Bob Saget is talking to you.  Oh, hi.  That's great.  I feel, wow, this is exciting.  Oh.  Oh, look at this.  You didn't say it was exciting when you heard that I was here.  Oh, man.  Thanks a lot.  Did he never eat meat?  Like, never, never, never tried it?  Never.  Never, never, ever, ever. 
[01:38:00]  Ever.  Why didn't you have him try it just when even his teeth came in?  No, I did.  I would bring it to him.  He'd be sitting at the table.  I would be trying to help.  When he was an infant, never.  Or he didn't like the smell, even.  He would turn his head away and, like, you know, start puking and stuff.  Wow.  So you kept trying?  Yeah, I would try over and over.  But you know what?  The doctor told me to knock that off because he didn't really need it.  If he didn't like it, not to make him eat it.  He was getting, you know, plenty of vitamins from all that chicken he was eating. 
[01:38:30]  What kind of wussy doctor is that?  Yeah.  You've got to force feed these kids.  Now, what type of chicken is this?  We're not talking about a grilled breast, right?  No, chicken fingers.  Fried chicken.  Okay.  Yeah.  So did you, like, put the fried chicken in the Cuisinart?  Oh, yeah.  I did all that when he was tiny.  Oh, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Dice it up and serve it as...  Yeah.  A shake.  All that stuff.  Yeah.  But he would...  And I would do that with meat, too, in the Cuisinart.  But no, he didn't want any part of it. 
[01:39:00]  Only the chicken.  Wow.  That's about to change.  That's amazing.  No potatoes unless they're French fried.  French fried potatoes.  Yeah.  Nothing like that.  Like, he eats like a child.  We've said this before.  He eats like he's eight years old.  A little observation.  Louis Black has entered the studio.  Another observation.  A good friend of the show.  Oh, wait.  Wait a minute.  Wait.  When did you guys become the food network?  Seriously.  I come in here, it's always a discussion about things that make me nauseous. 
[01:39:30]  And then it's like, what's your diet?  Did you eat enough?  What is this?  That's true.  There's usually girls doing horrific things in here.  And now we're like, hey, this steak is tasty.  Would you like?  What kind of spice are you using on that?  You know Sam never ate meat as a baby.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  We do have an executive chef making omelets for everybody today, Louis.  Well, I saw that, but you still don't discuss it.  We should just stop this.  But Sam has never tried steak before. 
[01:40:00]  Never.  All right, Mick.  Well, that's a different thing than this kind of sissy discussion.  Was it a problem with your molars?  That's right.  Did you see your bicuspids?  I just had an image of angry Vince meeting angry Louis Black.  Yeah, that would be, uh...  Louis.  Louis Black.  You're angry.  Well, I'm angry, too. 
[01:40:30]  Let's see who's angrier.  All right.  Let's see what happens.  Are we ready?  Okay.  All right.  Let's give him a little on the phone.  We start...  All right.  I'm going to give you the choice.  Opening course.  Rice or steak?  Start with the steak.  Let's start with the steak.  All right.  Okay.  The cutting has begun.  This is a nice little piece.  We can make this quick and painless, or I could go with the rhymes.  Oh, there's a couple little grains of rice on there, too. 
[01:41:00]  Wait.  I want to hear a rhyme.  A rhyme.  I'm coming up with, ooh, Sammy, whammy, what's the steaky-wakey?  Does the airplane need to return to its hangar?  All right.  This is...  Now, he's like the fifth Foley child now.  I've done this with all my children.  But I will stab Sam with this plastic fork if necessary.  Other kids didn't...  Little Mick didn't get the stabbing of the plastic utensil, right?  You're a kid. 
[01:41:30]  You don't care.  Here he comes.  Open that mouth.  Come on.  Open that mouth.  Open it.  You ready?  There's no parting of the lips here.  No, he's really...  His teeth are...  Here we go.  Open that.  Yes.  Chewing.  Chewing.  Take a place.  Chewing.  It's good.  No, no.  Get that garbage can away.  Chewing.  Chewing.  Chewing.  It's good steak.  Chewing.  Chewing.  He's all in your head, dude.  Chewing.  Oh, my God. 
[01:42:00]  We've got to chew it.  He's starting to hack a little bit.  Mom, he's turning red.  Is that okay?  Chewing.  Chewing good, because you can choke on steak.  Just chew.  The piece is flying out of his mouth as he coughs.  He's kind of dry heaving.  He can't keep it down.  Keep chewing.  It's all in his head.  What is he doing?  Spitting it out?  Well, he's coughing, like gagging, and pieces of steak are flying out of his mouth as he does it.  Now we're back.  He's got a fist to his mouth.  His eyes are tearing, and he's trying to swallow now. 
[01:42:30]  His eyes are shut.  He's really, his eyes are tearing.  I've got to massage the back here.  Oh, my God.  He's like kind of.  Did you get it down?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my goodness.  He's drooling.  He's crying.  What?  Why are you tearing up?  I don't get this.  Sam, how was it?  I'm cruel.  Describe it.  Bad.  It was like chewing stuff that I didn't want to chew, and then swallowing it whole.  But what was wrong with it?  It made me almost throw up.  Well, I know, but was it the taste?  Did it taste good?  Did it taste good? 
[01:43:00]  It was like, I don't know.  I couldn't even recognize the taste.  But like, I would start chewing, and then the minute I thought I was okay, and then the  juices came out of the meat, and I hit the back of my throat and started gagging again.  Well, let me tell you something.  There's a lot of gagging.  It cut off like an end piece that had a lot of brown.  It was mostly well done.  Mick, why don't we get that rare?  I prefer well done.  The piece that's a little more rare.  That's a little rare.  You've got to try different styles to see which one you like.  Take the middle right out of that.  Because when you go to a steak restaurant, they're going to ask you how you like it prepared. 
[01:43:30]  Not at all.  There you go.  Cut the middle out of that.  It'll be fun for them to watch him eat this in a steak restaurant.  Just rip.  You guys are damaging my boy.  Oh, no, Bobby.  He's fine.  Hey, Anthony.  Back to Louis Black.  Yeah, because the faces he's making over there.  But he's eating chicken.  Yeah, he eats chicken.  He eats chicken, but he doesn't eat fish.  No, he doesn't eat fish.  You don't eat fish?  Fish sticks.  Oh, fish sticks I'll eat.  Fish sticks.  How about breakfast?  Do you have Lucky Charms?  What do you eat?  Yeah, I'll eat cereal for breakfast. 
[01:44:00]  What's your favorite cereal?  Lucky Charms would go one for the apples.  I knew that for some reason.  Yeah, he eats the youngest cereal.  Yeah, yeah.  What's wrong?  I can feel it in my throat.  It's terrible.  It's steak.  Well, now we've got a nice rare piece coming up.  Here it is.  The second piece.  Sam.  Look at it.  No brown on this one.  There should be a lot of juices in this one.  Let's go back to McFaulay.  All right.  I just had an idea.  Last time I went with the rhyme.  This time I'm going to up the ante.  I'm going to do the Johnny Carson theme. 
[01:44:30]  All right.  All right.  Tell Mick to be gentle.  Oh, he is.  Sam's freaking out.  Sam's freaking out.  Louis Black is amazed.  It's like that thing.  What was that show where you guys would chop things up and they would drink it?  Remember that?  And they were throwing up in the studio?  Yeah.  It's like a mini version of it.  Yeah.  But a steak.  It's a wonderful steak.  Back in the day, we would eat mice on our show and all sorts of crazy stuff.  This is very good steak. 
[01:45:00]  We cooked up rats one day.  We didn't get a reaction from the people that ate the rat that night.  No.  They loved it.  We got it from Sam today with a juicy steak.  Yummy.  I don't want rats or steak.  All right.  No.  All right, Sam's mom.  Listen in.  All right.  Back to McFaulay with the Johnny Carson theme.  I feel for this because I was the guy in high school.  I mentioned this in the book.  I was the guy who ate weird things.  Right.  Back before it was cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Before like jackass and everybody else was doing it.  I was eating the worms before the boogeyman.  I made a mockery of it.  I could see that, though, because I remember the kid in school that would do that. 
[01:45:30]  You'd just be like, hey, man, eat this.  People were throwing the worms.  They were throwing the worms at me like to taunt me.  And I figure what better way to get back at them than to not only show that it didn't bother me, but I will eat this worm.  And somehow that one lone worm eating incident became like legend that I ate worms before every game, a plate full of them.  That was real good for my dating career.  Yeah, I bet.  No wonder I went, oh, for high school.  Ready?  Here we go, Sam. 
[01:46:00]  The next wonderful forkful.  Remember the Jim Ross interview?  I said, do you think that helped out my relationship, Jimmy?  Do you think girls wanted to kiss a boy who had worms on his breath?  I was a good kisser.  I never had a kiss to show.  What was I going to do?  Practice on a pillow.  That sounds horrible, man.  Here he comes.  You pinch the nose.  You know what?  I do that with my kids when they're at medicine.  I don't want to make this cruel.  Pinch the nose, cutting off the taste, okay? 
[01:46:30]  But it's not the taste.  It's the texture.  It's the thought.  The thought of that being in his mouth.  Don't stall him because the rice is what he really does want to eat.  Oh, really?  Okay.  It's not the whole killing a cow thing, is it?  No, I don't care about cows.  It's the animal blood in his mouth.  I believe this is lean American bison here.  All right, here we go.  It's good stuff.  All right, back to the Johnny Carson thing.  Go ahead.  Come on.  I am here.  Oh.  Inedible.  I can't do that. 
[01:47:00]  Down goes.  All right.  There's a little bit bigger.  Some hard gristle.  Come on.  Zesty taste of gristle and every bite.  There you go.  All right.  There we go.  There it is.  A raw pinot.  Oh, it's coming out.  Eat it.  Did it come out?  No.  No, he's eating it.  Let me quote Vince.  Keep eating.  Keep it in your mouth.  Sam's mommy's getting out.  Oh, you're going to puke.  Chew it.  He's not even a gagging.  You hold that in your mouth and hold it in there now.  You chew that steak.  You're going to eat steak if it's the last thing you do. 
[01:47:30]  That's right.  Chew it.  Chew that steak.  It's juicy.  This is the weirdest reaction I've ever seen to someone.  It's a good thing it's Mick Foley.  Really?  Yeah, see?  It's kind of like that spoonful of sugar, right?  Oh, he's having a tough time.  He's trying to swallow the...  You've got to chew it.  Good.  He needs a little Mary Poppins show tune.  Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.  The steakie go down. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, I did it.  All right.  Oh, it's down.  Look at him.  Again, his eyes are tearing.  His nose is running.  Why is his nose running, Mom?  Listen, because he can't breathe or anything.  This is amazing.  He's having a hard time.  He's sweating.  He's trying not to cry because he's doing all...  You guys know he's doing this for the show.  Of course.  Yes, he wouldn't do this just to do it.  He certainly would not.  Plus...  He's being a good sport, but...  You guys have Mick Foley there.  Thank you.  Yeah.  All right, try some rice and then we'll maybe leave Sam alone.  Bobby, does this upset you? 
[01:48:30]  Is that pie?  And the pie.  And the pie.  Dessert?  You're going to have to eat pie.  All right, what do you...  You got a special little something for the rice there, Mick Foley?  You got any meat pie?  Rice, rice, baby.  I've got nothing.  No, yeah, that's not enough.  The professional comedians are looking at me like...  They're laughing their asses off.  You're cracking Lewis Black.  Rice, rice, baby.  He's great.  Stick to the wrestling.  He doesn't like rice either?  No.  No, he hates rice.  His mother tried feeding him rice once and he threw it up. 
[01:49:00]  Can we just switch to some sort of a psychiatric clinic show?  Rice is...  But you will eat oatmeal?  No.  Only...  I'll eat oatmeal raw.  Uncooked.  Okay, yeah.  Well, you're totally sane.  I eat dirt.  I'll eat...  But he eats rice.  Thank you, Lewis.  He eats like an eight-year-old.  You don't really know this bit, but Sam's diet is the same as an eight-year-old.  Seriously.  Leo's frozen pizza, fish sticks, chicken nuggets, chicken fingers.  That's what he eats.  Sam, what did you eat last night? 
[01:49:30]  He never disappoints.  It's the same food an eight-year-old eats.  Go ahead.  Last night, I had leftover chicken fingers with like three or four pizza rolls.  Like little mini pizza rolls.  Yeah, I hope they're mini.  And some little celery sticks and then a glass of whole milk because I like whole milk.  Okay.  And then dessert?  Dessert.  Oh.  I got a...  My girlfriend bought these dibs. 
[01:50:00]  It's like little mini ice cream covered in chocolate with some little crunch bar things on it.  Those are good, yeah.  How old's your girlfriend?  Seven?  Seven.  That's the trouble.  His girlfriend is actually a lovely girl who wants to like go out to dinner at a nice restaurant.  And then they go out and he's like trying to find some...  There's something you could get at Chuck E. Cheese.  Hold on.  You don't make a fuss.  I don't make a fuss.  Well, you don't make a fuss, but perhaps she would like to dine with an adult.  Everybody has more of a problem with my eating habits than I do. 
[01:50:30]  I'm good.  Yeah, that's what Sam's mom explained.  Yeah.  He's a happy boy.  Sam can't be like everybody else.  Mrs. Sam, I just had a brainstorm here.  I see we've got the coffee condiments over there.  What if we got like half a cup of half and half, put some rice in it, and a couple packets of sugar?  It sounds like instant rice pudding.  I don't like pudding.  I hate pudding.  All right, let's see what happens when you feed them rice.  It's just plain white rice.  Good white rice. 
[01:51:00]  Just white, right?  Now, don't mess with me because this stuff will fall off the spoon.  Can you do the rice, rice baby?  We kind of like that.  Rice, rice, baby.  Rice, rice, baby.  Under pressure.  Here we go.  There you go.  Hey, he's.  Ah, yeah.  No, no, no, no, no.  He's dry heaving over rice.  It's rice.  Oh, God.  He just like swallowed it.  He swallowed it whole. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, it's done.  You didn't like roll that around.  You roll this around in your mouth.  He didn't chew it.  He's still dry heaving.  He turns red and his eyes start watering immediately.  I think you need a bigger forkful.  No, that won't help at all.  That would be very bad, and I might choke and die.  No, you can't choke on a little rice thing.  You can't choke on rice.  How about one more, and then we'll move on.  Can I ask a question?  Can I get a copy of this for my reel?  Believe me, it's all in the magic of videotape.  Big serving.  Oh, wow. 
[01:52:00]  Look at that big spoon.  It's terrible.  There you go.  You think you can fit that?  Yeah.  You can fit that.  Big Sammy.  He's got a big mouth.  All right.  Nick Foley, Sam, some more rice.  Oh, boy.  I see rice things.  Come on, Sam.  And your mom's listening.  Yeah.  Come on.  Here it is.  Big spoonful.  Chew it up.  Get it all.  Yes.  No, no spit it out.  Don't spit it out.  Oh, my God.  Look at him chewing.  He's chewing as fast as a chipmunk.  He's trying to.  Oh, God. 
[01:52:30]  He's trying to eat me.  It's his head.  It feels like maggots in your mouth.  Is that what it is?  It's the texture.  Is it the texture of all those little pieces of rice?  He doesn't want to talk.  He's trying to get it down.  Did you get it down?  Yeah.  He enjoyed it.  It's down.  It's down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Now, would you ever eat rice in your everyday life?  No.  How would I put myself through that?  But Maury is able to cure everyone's phobias.  Yeah.  This is the way we cure phobias, like Maury Povich.  This is Manchurian Candidate, is what this is.  Go to Louis Black. 
[01:53:00]  Seriously.  Eight, nine, ten.  At some point, you go, gee, no, it's rice.  I'm not being forced to eat cat cervix.  Okay?  I mean, seriously.  Is there a shrink somewhere?  There's got to be deeper than this.  This is a deep problem.  It's got rice.  There's a billion things to eat.  You've cut off 98% of them.  And to what end?  To what end? 
[01:53:30]  So that I can sit here and watch it, watch you choke.  It's rice.  You eat oatmeal out of a box, Mr. Black.  We've got to get you to a nut.  This is not for a diet show.  This is a nut job show.  It's rice.  Oh, you're glad my mother's not here.  Yeah.  Oh, look at what's on the plate now that Kenny's bringing over.  Oh, it's dessert time.  It's two slices.  One, I believe, is apple pie.  And what's the other?  Is that sweet potato pie? 
[01:54:00]  Oh, lucky boy.  Wow.  Who's the lucky boy, Sam?  I have no idea.  Mom?  Yeah?  Has he ever eaten apple pie or a sweet potato pie?  Sam has not, no.  No.  Why doesn't he like pie?  My mom is a wonderful chef.  She makes pies from scratch.  How would you know it?  Well, I eat, like, her cookies.  What type of pies do you make?  I make all kinds of pies.  But no.  And he doesn't eat any of them.  Whenever I make pies, I also make chocolate cake, because that's the one thing Sam likes. 
[01:54:30]  So I always have a pie and a chocolate cake.  Does he go for a ride on the pony afterwards?  Do you have a Shetland in the garage?  Sam's mom, I think you've, you know, I don't know much about parenting at all.  Believe me.  I really don't.  And you've raised a wonderful boy here.  But just on the outside, I think you've spoiled him a bit.  I think you've spoiled your little boy.  I think that's why God sent Sam, so I could spoil him. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  Oh, that's why God sent Sam.  That's adorable.  It's like the definition of gay.  All right, listen, we've got to take a break.  Then we'll have McFoley feed some dessert to Sam.  And then we'll finally be done with this, Sam.  And then we're going to do some car crash comedy as well with everybody in the house here.  We've got Bob Saget, Lewis Black, and of course McFoley.  All three guys will be at the show tomorrow night at the BNC for the big comedy show.  So tickets still available through Ticketmaster.  Also, Drew Boogie in studio playing us in and out of breaks. 
[01:55:30]  Why don't you take it away there, Drew?  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Life and...  Good evening.  Good evening.  Food.  All right.  All right.  No.  No.  No.  No. 
[01:56:00]  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  He's dead.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  My health doesn't allow it.  No.  No.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  By the way, a message to the affiliates.  We're going a little late today. 
[01:56:30]  If you want to stay with the program, that would be awesome.  We would love that.  If not, we understand.  But we have too much stuff to try to squeeze in here still.  We've got to go back to Sam eventually and have him eat his dessert.  We've got Bob Saget in studio and Louis Black.  Both those guys will be performing tomorrow night at the PNC as part of our O&A Child and  Virus Comedy Show.  McFoley's going to be there signing autographs and hanging out a little bit with us.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  Right now, we're going to give away the opening slot for the tour. 
[01:57:00]  Oh.  We're doing the car crash comedy.  Yeah, yeah.  We've got, I think, ten comedians.  You guys can help us out, Louis.  Yeah, I don't want to be the lone guy.  We're going to help you out.  Are we going to make this?  Each comic that comes in, do we make them eat steak and rice?  Is that what happens?  Yeah.  See if they vomit.  Well, just keeping with the humiliation theme.  You know it's not just guys coming in here to do comedy, Louis.  You know it's better than that by now.  Oh, that's great.  I thought we were going to have to listen to it.  It's live.  Yeah. 
[01:57:30]  It's live.  Spectacular.  Maybe there or have to go stand up on the stage.  Don't have them this close to me.  On the stage.  Or how about right in front of the chef as he's cooking more omelets?  Well, we need a space for the audience as well.  So maybe.  All right.  Bring in the audience.  I'm thinking like we can actually get him up on that little platform so he's got like  a stage almost.  Yeah.  Here's our potential comedians there, Louis.  They're coming in one by one.  One of these guys will open up the show tomorrow night at the PNC.  I'm way too close.  This is freaking me out.  You can't be that close. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  Well, come on.  Can that mic reach over here?  Yeah.  Louis, sit on that couch.  Yeah.  You can sit over there, Louis.  You can sit with Mick Foley and he'll feed you some breakfast.  Believe me, I understand, Louis.  Mick will feed you.  He'll feed you your omelet this morning.  And give you your coffee in a sippy cup.  But here's the deal, Louis.  These guys are going to perform.  And when we don't like a joke, actually, Anthony kind of hits the car crash button.  But I will now take cues from professionals and everybody in the room. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  So if you want Anthony to hit the car crash because we don't have enough car crash buttons,  you just kind of, you know, point to him and he'll crash them.  If they get three car crashes, they're done.  Okay.  All right.  Where's the rest of our staff?  We should have like an audience too.  Like that's not just comedians.  Yeah.  Bring everybody in.  Yeah.  Because you know what comics are.  They're not going to laugh at anybody.  That's the way we started.  No, we'll laugh.  Well, you know, but they're competing, so no one would laugh at anybody else's crap if  they're competing.  Yeah.  They're not going to laugh at each other.  Now, these guys, do they understand that their careers are hanging in the balance?  They're not only going to be judged by legendary stand-up figures, but by a pro wrestler as 
[01:59:00]  well?  I could be the end of their career.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah.  Mick Foley will be body slamming everyone that doesn't get through to the end of their  set.  What do they get?  Two minutes?  Yeah.  Two minutes or three car crashes.  Or three car crashes.  Okay.  Two minutes seems like ten.  I love this.  You have no idea the hell that we used to go through.  I can't say no to somebody.  I always feel bad.  That's one of my problems, you know?  Oh, don't worry.  Don't worry. 
[01:59:30]  There's plenty of people in this room that can say no.  That's what we're here for.  We'll make up for it.  How about in Bob's case, he'll say the opposite of what he really feels.  So if he says it's great, we will know that's a...  Hey, I like that.  That's nice.  That usually does happen anyway.  Oh, you're going to do great.  To the guy's Grover in a trash can.  I don't know.  Oscar.  Homeless puppet.  Than is the host of Car Crash Comedy.  Yes.  The MC.  Where should the guys sit, Than?  Where do you think they should...  Because they're all just standing there awkwardly in front of the food. 
[02:00:00]  Shouldn't they sit somewhere so they can kind of watch?  Yeah, I kind of think Indian style, like it's story time on the floor.  Is that cool with everybody?  Sure, and that's not passive aggressive to suggest it, either.  No.  Everybody should be on the floor, Indian style.  Well, half these guys aren't going to get back up after being on the floor.  All right.  Not going to face the comic?  All right, then.  Yeah.  Why you guys...  You have to look at the comedian, right?  Yeah, so work your way over here, please.  Not too close to me, but...  Yeah.  Let me test the car crash. 
[02:00:30]  Everybody hear that through the speaker?  All right, we're all good.  The guy who won this in Philly backed out, by the way.  Yeah.  He's 41, he's been doing comedy for a long time, and he backed out with the excuse of,  that's a young man's game, and he thinks he should be getting money.  He's just, he's a douche, he's afraid, and he won't admit that he's afraid to fright  little man.  Yeah, because the guy that won in D.C., he went up and he destroyed.  He was good.  He did six or seven minutes, and he destroyed.  In my opinion, being afraid does not make one a douche, though. 
[02:01:00]  But backing out does.  Backing out does.  Backing out.  If you're a comedian, and you back out, and you're not honest about being afraid, that  to me was what...  Yeah, we gave him a great opportunity.  Being afraid is okay.  And we gave him an in on a syndicated radio show, and now we're like, all right, so long,  man.  Take care.  Have fun when you're late.  Everyone gets scared, son.  All right, let's go.  All right, should I do a joke or two to warm up the house?  Oh, yeah.  Ah, warm up the crowd a little bit.  Fantastic.  That's the reason I raced down here.  I love it.  I appreciate it, Lewis.  All right. 
[02:01:30]  Hi, everybody.  Welcome to Car Crash Comedy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Woo, jeez.  Thank you, everyone.  Thank you.  Fantastic.  I'm your host, Nathaniel Bryan.  Yeah, my parents gave me the name Nathaniel.  That's usually how it works.  And they told me it's a biblical name, which means gift of God, which I thought was pretty  nice.  I guess I couldn't find a name in the Bible that meant shortcomings of the rhythm method,  which would have been more accurate. 
[02:02:00]  Can we hit the car crash?  No, not on our host.  We don't crash our host.  You can crash me.  No, I wouldn't crash you.  I hate you.  That's your mom.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, my mom rules.  No, wait.  Drinks.  That's what she does.  I don't have a whole set.  Just a couple jokes here.  I don't know if you can tell under this light, but I'm actually 164th Cherokee.  Yeah, I did the math, and I think that means my great, great, great grandfather had sex 
[02:02:30]  with a Native American woman back in the 1800s.  I have a hard time thinking that was consensual.  So not only am I white, but I'm a descendant of a hate crime.  All right, they're warm.  They're ready to go.  All right, man, the host of the car crash.  All right, coming to the stage, by then I mean floor, the first comedian.  Let's hear it for Greg Coraluzzo.  Oh, yeah.  Let's go, Greg.  All right. 
[02:03:00]  Thanks.  Light me at two seconds so I can do my last bit, if that's cool.  Anyway, I was going to sell my digital camera on eBay, but I couldn't take a picture of it.  So I took a picture of it with myself in the mirror, and I was just like, but then it  looked like my MySpace picture, and people didn't know what they were bidding on.  They were like, am I bidding on the camera or his abs?  I was getting weird questions.  People were like, does it have a digital flash? 
[02:03:30]  Is it really that delicious?  No.  Andy.  Oh, no.  Man, that's killer.  That's killer stuff, bro.  So I wanted to, my best friend Pete, he's got, he's huge.  He's ripped.  He's got tattoos.  He's got like lots of tattoos.  And one of them says like discipline on it, because he's ripped, and he lifts weights  and stuff, and that's cool.  I can never get a tattoo like that.  I'd have to get a tattoo of something that said like procrastination, or I like donuts 
[02:04:00]  or something, or I like a tattoo that would be useful.  Like I would get a tattoo of abs on my abs, like 40 pack of abs, just, and the more I  would eat, the more abs I would get, and it would be awesome.  I thought that would be ridiculous, or maybe, I'm just going to keep yelling.  That's all right.  Maybe I'd get a tattoo of like a Chinese face on my face and infiltrate Chinatown, and that  would be ridiculous for me.  It'd be lovely. 
[02:04:30]  You guys have been great.  Big or easy.  Wow.  Thanks, man.  All right.  We're off to a great start.  Everybody drive carefully.  I like Greg's technique, though, where if something was about to bomb, he would roll  it into the next joke.  Yes.  Like, I don't really care, punchline.  But it's funny you should say that.  Right there.  Like, no, that wasn't the punchline.  That was the set up.  And he used positive words, like that'd be delicious.  Yeah, Mick Foley, everyone.  Fabulous.  Like, help me out here, but was that kind of vaguely Wright-esque, like Stephen Wright-esque? 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit, a little bit.  Okay.  I liked it.  I liked it.  All right.  You guys ready for your next comedian?  Yes.  All right.  Yeah.  Coming to the stage is Chris Pugliese.  Pugliese.  Sure.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  This is pretty crazy in a room, the same studio as Jim Norton.  It's been five hours since I was this close to a VD. 
[02:05:30]  Thank you.  I appreciate that.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I like it.  I wanted to tell one of my favorite jokes that my mom used to tell me when I was a wee  lad, which was, uh, I'd be tucked in and she'd say, why is six afraid of seven?  Does anyone know?  It's because seven has AIDS.  That's why.  Yeah.  Thank you for the picture. 
[02:06:00]  It was nice.  Oh, man.  So, uh, I don't know what's going on now.  Good segue though, Chris.  I appreciate it.  I got a fun fact for everyone out there.  Yeah.  Uh, the, uh, mammal with the largest willy proportionately in the world is the walrus 
[02:06:30]  and the mammal with the second largest willy is these.  Damn it.  That's horrible.  Oh, gross.  Wow.  Well, I don't deserve that.  Yes, Jim.  Go ahead.  We're finished.  No, I want to hear what you're saying.  I won't interrupt you.  No, I'm failing miserably.  Oh, man.  I don't know.  That's good.  Thank you.  Stop it.  You're not failing.  You're learning.  Yeah.  That's true.  Hey, Lewis, that's some encouragement. 
[02:07:00]  That's nice.  You got to take, God.  Isn't failing miserably kind of like dying tragically?  A little bit repetitive, right?  It happens.  I guess it isn't as easy as people like Thann make it look.  Well, it didn't go the way you hoped, but to take something from this, you looked very  comfortable.  I do.  No, Jimmy's being serious.  Yeah, you leaned on the mic stand.  Yeah, you looked really relaxed, and it just flowed.  And look, on a positive side, I'm fired up, because Lewis just laughed at something I  said, so I feel really good about myself. 
[02:07:30]  But you failed miserably out there, Chris.  All right.  So far, they both seem like funny, amicable guys that had decent stage presence if they  had stuff that didn't sound like they were walking off a freeway off-ramp while they're  being plowed by trucks.  The premise of this thing is like you're getting winged on the freeway.  Oh, yeah.  It's definitely over and over.  Hey, they're telling us we got a break, because we're going to go late today.  So to the affiliates, we're going to continue. 
[02:08:00]  One more?  Can we squeeze one more in before a break?  Yeah, one quick one.  All right.  And to the affiliates, once again, we're going long today.  If you want to continue with the show, that would be great.  I know if Boston is, I think Philly is, I think New York is.  Yeah, hang out.  Hang out for nothing.  What's wrong with you?  What's going to happen?  Where are they going?  10 and 11, you idiots.  All right.  Let's hear it for Mark Schutt.  Or Schutt.  Marky.  Yeah.  What's up, Mark?  How you doing, everyone?  Yeah, that was a bad intro, I know.  As you can see, I'm a big, fat, insert and expletive here that I can't really get away 
[02:08:30]  with on FM.  But a couple of months ago, I decided, you know what, I think it's time I go to the gym,  try and drop some pounds.  So I go join the gym, I'm on the treadmill, this really old woman on the treadmill to my  left, all of a sudden this beautiful girl shows up, gets on the treadmill to my right.  I'm just sitting there like, ugh, as I'm walking on the treadmill.  So I'm like, hmm, I think it's time to go up a little bit, try and impress her a little  bit.  So I crank up the speed a little bit, I'm going faster and faster, it's like my legs 
[02:09:00]  can't keep up.  I kind of look over, as soon as I look over, bam, fall face first down on the treadmill.  The treadmill shoots me backwards like five feet off the ground.  The old woman on my right, my left, just starts laughing hysterically.  The hot chick on my left, oh my god, I can't get my left and right, right.  The hot chick on my right.  Please, Ann, please.  She's like, look down at me, shakes her head and goes off.  Goes off to the exercise bike or something.  So I look up at the old woman laughing. 
[02:09:30]  Oh my god.  Okay.  Ann, please.  I want to see where this is going.  I mean, I'm on the fence side.  I'm like, okay, thanks for laughing.  Can you help me out now, mom?  That's two, two at the end, that's a done deal.  Oh, Lewis is saying he's done.  I think, wow.  Let's hear it for Mark, everybody.  I wanted to hear where it was going.  Mark, the problem is it was just too rapid fire.  You need longer set up for the gate. 
[02:10:00]  Too rapid fire.  It was, punch, punch, punch, punch.  The instinct was right.  The instinct was you tell a story.  Yeah, right.  And the reveal wasn't quite as shocking as we wanted it to be.  Yeah, they had to be so.  Mom.  I needed blood.  I needed something.  I'm reminded of what Steve Martin said to John Candy in Planes, Trains, and Automobiles,  which is when you tell a story, have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting to the listener.  Hey, we got to take a quick, quick break. 
[02:10:30]  We're going late for all the affiliates out there that want to continue with the show.  Bob Saget's got to leave.  He's doing more radio elsewhere, I guess, right?  Not that I want to do it, but it's like hours in Eskimo areas, you know, like far reaches  of the content.  But we'll see it tomorrow night at the PNC.  And the HBO thing I did that we're looking forward to seeing Jim's in a couple months.  Yours is on Saturday.  Mine's on Saturday.  Saturday night, 10 o'clock.  All right.  Then they put it on DVD on Tuesday and then for Micah on Thursday.  There you go.  Bob Saget, everyone.  More with Louis Black and Mick Foley as we continue Car Crash Comedy. 
[02:11:00]  Once again, to the affiliates, we're going long.  If you want to continue with us, that would be great.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Here comes the boys from the side.  Bulba.  Here comes the power.  Ready and anus.  How you like me now?  I said it.  Power.  Anus.  Power.  Anus.  Anus.  Wow. 
[02:11:30]  We're still on regular radio.  That was a little close, man.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We got Louis Black in studio, Mick Foley in studio.  Both will be at the PNC tomorrow night.  Of course, Jim Norton will be there as well.  It's going to be really, really cool.  I can't wait for tomorrow's show.  I just got to mention, before Tracy kills me, Bill Burr and I are doing that hostile takeover  today from 3 to 7, so tune in.  Ooh.  Here in New York.  Yeah, it'll be a hoot.  Hearing a lot of positive reviews, Jim.  Yes.  Well, I wouldn't know.  We didn't do it yet.  Oh, jeez. 
[02:12:00]  Oh.  I mean, between your guys' interaction.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They didn't do it yet.  Oh, no.  All right.  Of course not.  Now I'm with you, Jim.  I'm like, what?  All right.  Car Crash Comedy for the opening slot for the show tomorrow night at PNC.  Here we go, fan.  All right.  Keeping the show rolling right along.  Let's hear it for Joe Conti.  All right.  What's going on, everybody?  How you doing, huh?  Yeah.  Woo.  38-year-old single guy, but I do have this girl that comes over to my house, and she treats 
[02:12:30]  me real nice, does special things to me, and my friends think it's great, but I try to  explain to them, I said, nah, it's not good, man, not good at all, because she's huge.  She's enormous.  She looks like the trash heap, you know?  And they're like, no, you're exaggerating.  I said, no, dude.  Look at me.  I'm 250 pounds.  When I sit next to her on the couch, I look like an eight-year-old boy getting molested by  John Goodman in a wig.  Yeah, it's like being in a Tom Petty video, you know what I mean?  But I met her on this little website, it's called monster.com, I don't know if you've  been on there. 
[02:13:00]  But being 38, now I'm at that point in my life where everybody has to go get their prostate  checked, and I don't have that problem.  I don't go to my doctor, I don't have that problem at all.  See, I go to this Russian massage parlor about four times a week, I get my prostate checked  there all the time, so much so that now my prostate smells like cigarettes, vodka, and  oppression.  But, like I said, the thing is, the thing is, is that being single, I realize is because  women are absolute liars when it comes to what they're looking for in a guy. 
[02:13:30]  They always say they want a guy good-looking, well, not good-looking, actually, they want  a guy who's like, you know, oh, thanks for the photo, appreciate it.  They want a guy, they always say, a guy who's like, has a good personality, good sense of  humor, that's crap, because I got a good personality, I have a damn good sense of humor.  I couldn't get laid in Rwanda with an Entenmann's truck and an AIDS vaccine.  Wow.  Yeah, I know, you're all picturing me driving around some big white truck with like a crumb  cake in one hand and a pecan pie in the other, which one I'm going to offer to the skinny, 
[02:14:00]  burnt-looking chick, I know.  Yeah.  And I'll give you an opportunity to do one more.  How come everybody with Down syndrome looks like Mickey Rooney?  Thank you very much, guys.  Waiting for the answer.  That was good.  I like the fact that he fired up, he dug the hole and went right back into the hole.  Yep, yep.  That's the best.  He couldn't get enough dirt on himself.  I appreciate that.  It's got to be pointed out, they're still talking about the treadmill on Paltone. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, I know.  And on Instant Payback.  They won't leave it alone.  Tell us more about the treadmill, Mark.  That just came in.  Could I ask for a little, uh, oh yes, give me a good advice here.  Sure.  Is there humor to be mined from Rwanda and did he just not get it or is that just kind  of a subject that doesn't lend itself to laughter?  I don't think he went far enough.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's definitely humor there.  Yeah.  Definitely.  I just don't like the way you said oppression instead of oppression.  That was my only problem. 
[02:15:00]  No one says oppression.  We understand.  That was your only problem.  My only problem.  She smelled like vodka, cigarettes, and oppression.  Just sounded like weird.  But I like the joke.  The best part is watching Louis just nervously rub his eyes.  This is unbelievable.  This brings back so many.  You ever do, they used to do these things in, uh, colleges where you go in at lunchtime.  Oh, yeah.  In a cafeteria.  Oh, God.  And they're just bringing things up and kids are getting salads and throwing stuff at each 
[02:15:30]  other.  And you go, is the mic on?  Is the mic on?  I threw up before one of those.  I was doing one.  Dennis Ross booked me for like 200 bucks and I had like a big Dunkin' Donuts coffee and  I started to see where I was going to stand and I had to go and I threw up.  Oh, yeah?  I didn't want to set.  Yeah.  It didn't go well.  The vomiting was the highlight.  All right, let's go.  I did one of those with Bob Kelly a year ago.  Oh, really?  That's where Bob is.  What happened?  They had to drag him out of the cafeteria five hours later?  Enough, fat boy.  Thanks for the gig, though, Bob. 
[02:16:00]  All right.  We're going to keep the show rolling with Dennis Montesano.  Dennis.  All right, Dennis.  Thank you.  First of all, I just want to say it's an honor to be in front of the Commandant, Mr.  Cumia here.  Oh, wow.  Uh, I, the town I grew up in, no diversity at all.  I'm from, the closest landmark we have is Poughkeepsie, so you can understand how much  it sucks.  Uh, there's about one black guy in my town, drives a Cadillac, everybody watches him, puts 
[02:16:30]  their hands on his wallet when they, when he comes by.  Oh.  I get down to the city this morning, dark out, see a guy come up looking for change.  I can't see anything.  All I see is a floating eyeball.  It's a black guy with an eye patch.  Oh.  Uh, I hate kids.  Just, just a general statement.  I can't stand them.  I've always had this dream of running through Toys R Us, kicking kids off the little bicycles  and making everybody miserable. 
[02:17:00]  Just a dream of just swatting a Barbie out of a little girl's hand and watching her cry.  There's nothing more satisfying.  I keep waiting to see if they're done.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's fine.  That's fine.  Uh.  I, uh, I, I'm not a big fan of Hillary Clinton.  Anyone else?  No?  Nothing?  I don't understand how someone like that can be a senator for another state.  And the fact that she changes her accent for wherever she is. 
[02:17:30]  She's worse than Carson Daly on TRL when a rapper shows up.  I like that.  Okay.  I like how all, we're all uncomfortable.  No, kill it.  Kill it.  Kill it.  I'm taking that one.  I even lost accepted because you were in it.  You know, there's nothing to do with this.  You know, this is really, seriously, I don't like being in this position.  But I'm stuck having to keep America entertained. 
[02:18:00]  What can I say?  What are we supposed to do?  I come in, they say I'm supposed to judge you guys.  Okay?  This is the third rung of hell.  Welcome to it.  You want to do this?  This is the deal.  It is.  If it's not the three of us, the five of us, the six of us here, it's six drunk idiots  out in Puma, Wyoming, who want to, like, you know, barf on your back after the show.  They just sit there.  Live with it.  I'm sorry. 
[02:18:30]  The Hillary Clinton thing didn't work.  Did you crash it?  I think Lewis is calling.  He's asking for a crash.  He's a professional.  I don't feel badly.  I'm sorry.  It'll make them tougher, right, Lewis?  Yeah.  Mick liked it, but I had to stop it.  Okay.  I am.  You're the pro.  I had to stop it.  But that was an inspirational speech, wasn't it?  It was.  It was like Newt Rock.  Yes, it was.  It was amazing.  You're right, it was.  I was thinking, man, I had never thought of writing a screenplay about comedy, but that 
[02:19:00]  would, if I was going to write one, that's a speech I would steal.  This is the gentlest treatment you're going to get.  What was the town again?  Puma, Wyoming.  Puma, Wyoming.  Yeah, we just, I just came through, drove through on the bus to all of Wyoming, and you could just  literally, you might as well just, you know, what's more fun would be to take a razor blade  and just slit parts of your eyeball.  The best was Mick Foley.  No, it's inspiring.  I was inspired.  But now, if he'd gone with the Hillary thing, if he'd been able to work a different accent, 
[02:19:30]  if he'd been able to use a Hillary accent, could he have made that piece work?  Oh, yeah, no.  He had all, there was something there.  That's the problem.  You start getting, you get all the elements there, and then you kind of, you've got to  go through it a billion times to figure out where the funny is.  All right.  Which is why it's, failure's the best thing.  We don't learn anything when something's funny.  We don't.  We go, oh, that was good.  Oh, my God.  But it's when you screw it, when you've got it, and it doesn't work.  That's when you learn it.  It's just a painful, it's a suck experience. 
[02:20:00]  Right.  People are saying that you won the contest, Lewis.  I swear to God.  They can't wait to see you open up.  You should open up this show and then do your other set later on.  The winner of Car Crash Company, Lewis Black.  All right, guys, man.  All right.  Let's hear it for tennis.  And then coming up next is Jake Link.  Jake.  All right.  What's up, Jake?  Christ, I can't feel my leg right now, and now I know how Heather Mills feels. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, I want to see you by a round of applause.  How many guys here like a nice rack?  Come on.  Clap it up.  Yeah.  Nice rack.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on.  Wows and everything.  Come on.  Well, I like boobs so much that I grew my own set.  Yeah.  That's what I'm talking about.  If you couldn't tell by looking at me, I'm a fat, disgusting slob.  Hey, hey.  Come on.  I kind of look like Macaulay Culkin if he really let himself go. 
[02:21:00]  He did the visual.  I will not take a 15-year-old joke.  That was a cute little visual.  I'm starting to think Mick Foley's punch drunk.  My friend and I the other day were having a conversation.  He's like, Jake, you shouldn't be so down on yourself because you're ugly and stuff.  You know, pleasing yourself is always sex with someone you love.  I looked at him and said, in my case, it's a pity, like, just one big self-inflicted rape.  Yeah. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, I have a girlfriend, though, unfortunately.  I don't know how I got her.  But she's been complaining to me about for the past six months about getting her a ring.  It's like, oh, when are you going to get me a ring?  I just want a ring every time a Zales commercial comes on.  I want a ring.  So after the six months of complaining, I finally gave her a ring around her left eye.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't like the joke, but I liked where it was coming from.  Yeah.  That's why I almost didn't crash him.  It was kind of...  Oh, you punched her in the face. 
[02:22:00]  Go ahead.  One more.  It's a puncher in the face joke.  Let's hear it for Jake Link, everybody.  All right, Jake.  Yeah.  Still no one yet to have made it to the end of their set.  Wow.  How many more we got?  Three more.  All right.  And you might recognize this fella from last week at D.C.  Taking another swing is Rob Statz.  Oh, good for you.  All right.  Rob, yeah.  Oh, he did pretty well down there.  Thanks for having me back, guys.  Yeah, I came up.  A lot of my friends listen to K-Rock, so they ask me to get back on the show for them.  Okay.  Those of you who don't know, I'm from Jersey, and I love being from Jersey because I do 
[02:22:30]  a lot of traveling, and whenever I go out, people are like, where are you from?  All I got to do is say Jersey, because if you think about it, it's the only state that  starts with the word new that you can drop the new from, and people still know what you're  talking about.  Like, you can't do that with, like, York or Hampshire.  It sounds kind of gay.  Like, or even worse, like, if you told somebody you were from Mexico.  Which one?  The old one or the new one?  Like, I have a question.  Based on the original Mexico, who thought it would be a good idea to build a new one? 
[02:23:00]  Don't they know the sequel is never better than the original, and the original kind of  sucked to begin with?  Like, I always wonder about, like, new Mexicans, though.  Do they try to sneak into surrounding states and steal jobs?  Like, since they're new Mexicans, does that mean they'd be, like, taller, stronger, faster,  smarter, greasier?  And they'd be, like, Mexicans, version 2.0.  Like, from the people who brought you Mexicans, coming to a Home Depot near you.  New Mexicans, Mexicans, version 2.0, this time with citizenship. 
[02:23:30]  You didn't talk that last week.  Exactly.  No, I actually realized I have a lot of, like, Latino, Hispanic friends, and I just realized,  like, recently that they have certain aspects, like, in certain aspects of life, they have  more choices than us, like, regular people.  Like, if they don't like their last name, it's cool, because they have three more to pick  from.  If they don't like their father, it's cool, because they have, like, three more to pick  from. 
[02:24:00]  I'm going to wrap up with that, though.  Guys, thanks for having me back.  I'm going to wrap up before, for the third one.  So far, he's only got two.  Thanks, Rob.  Because comedy has nothing to do with surprise, so didn't it last week say.  I just started feeling a little uneasy, but I know Sam is part Mexican.  We don't know what he is. 
[02:24:30]  But here was my problem, if you don't mind me saying it.  It started out, just my take on it, it started out really funny, and then it was almost like  when I was watching Vince, when he kept on pulling obstacles out of, or objects out of  JR's butt.  Yeah.  It was, like, funny the first three times, and by, like, the twelfth time, by the time  he pulled an Oklahoma football helmet out, I was just kind of looking at my shoes, wondering  who the hell I worked for.  Same thing, when you go with the race humor, at first it was funny, and then I started kind 
[02:25:00]  of feeling bad about myself, you know?  Did you feel it was the same joke?  A little bit, yeah.  A little bit.  Too much of the same joke, right?  It just started, it became a little less funny, a little more mean, so hopefully that's  constructive there.  That's good.  You ought to teach this stuff.  It's funny how the thing you disliked about it is exactly what I did like about it.  But you see, I had to go back to when my truck was going through Puma, Wyoming, and the lovely 
[02:25:30]  folks in Puma.  But I love the line about, yeah, I'm heading up to Hampshire this week.  That would sound...  Yeah.  Lewis, any comments?  You guys, I'm fried now.  I feel literally as if I've been electric shock.  No, I thought it was good.  I think everybody's...  The amazing thing is that everybody's got presence.  Yeah.  You know, everybody's...  You know, because basically getting up there, the first, the initial thing about getting  up there is that sense of, you were just taking a punch.  Yeah.  Right in your head, and that's it.  And everybody's, you know, come through on that. 
[02:26:00]  That somebody's going to open this, unless somebody shows up here in the next five minutes,  you're screwed.  That's what I'm saying.  You're screwed.  I don't know who's opening.  Who wants to win this contest?  I think we just give Sam some food.  Mick Foley might be trying out.  Feed Sam.  I might go up there.  You know, the only problem is it's kind of a tight contest with all the self-deprecating  big guys up there, you know?  Well, yeah.  What do we got, two left?  And two more comedians, all right?  Coming up next, Hassan Madri. 
[02:26:30]  Yes.  All right.  Thank you.  Hi.  Hi.  It's good to wake up at four in the morning, be trapped in this tiny room with a bunch of  fat, sweaty...  It's like a caustic mix between sex offenders and virgins.  I don't...  Nothing?  Okay.  I'm also a big fat guy.  I like to dress up when I go out, though, you know?  I was wearing a nice shirt when I was out, and my friend was like, that's a nice shirt.  I said, where'd you get that? 
[02:27:00]  Did you get that at Barney's?  I was like, yeah, that's what I did.  I went to Barney's, bought a 5XL shirt.  This is from Casual Male XL.  This is every fat guy's nice shirt.  We all wear the same nice shirt.  Not because we're fat, because we're casual.  I'm not a...  I'm not an educated man.  I don't know if you guys can tell that right away.  I have a junior high school education.  I just never finish high school.  I stayed in high school for a really long time, though.  I was in high school for so long that if my guidance counselor inappropriately touched 
[02:27:30]  me, it would have just been two plus-sized guys trying to keep it honest about their  feelings.  It wouldn't even have been illegal.  I had a lot of nicknames in high school.  When I went to high school in Staten Island, everybody used to call me Taff.  It's really not that clever.  It's just fat backwards.  When I went to high school in the city, that one was a little more direct.  Everybody used to call me just Sand-N, or Hey You, Sand-N, or Get Out of My Country.  Those are the three. 
[02:28:00]  I think the weirdest nickname I ever had, that was for two weeks, the newspapers called  me the Night Rapist, which...  Don't pigeonhole me.  I do that during the day.  I'm stealthy.  Is that it?  I'm going to use them.  Thank you.  No crashes.  All right.  That was good, man.  That was kind of thing.  You could have crashed one at the beginning, but it gave you the benefit of the doubt.  Titty-bop.  I have a question.  Do you say Sand-N, you said because we're on the radio, but in your live act, you say 
[02:28:30]  the whole word?  I call my mother Sand-N.  No, but you say the real word in the act.  Okay, cool.  All right.  Our last comedian.  Well, no, I'm making sure he's not being PC.  That was funny.  Yeah.  He's killing me.  I love it.  This whole thing is killing me.  Makes me look at the people from Staten Island a little less favorably, though.  All right.  Our final comedian of the lovely experience. 
[02:29:00]  Let's hear it.  Coming from North Carolina.  It's James Snyder.  Oh, boy.  Come on, James.  You came out from North Carolina for this?  Yes, sir.  Not to call you sir.  Sorry.  That's all good.  Where?  In Mooresville.  About 30 minutes outside Charlotte.  Yep.  I know.  By Puma.  All right.  Yeah, I know.  I'm not too happy there, but.  Oh, wow.  You're shaking.  Oh, boy.  You're shaking.  No, I'm not shaking here.  I just had to change my whole set because I thought I was going to do the XM thing.  But anyway, I want to get to know my audience a little bit. 
[02:29:30]  You know, where's everyone from?  Just real quickly.  What?  Jersey?  Did I hear Jersey?  You know, I actually have a connection to Jersey.  My son used to live in New Jersey, but then his mother miscarried.  I like it.  All right.  But try the action thing.  Try the.  Oh, no.  I'm up here with a real, real heavy heart, though.  I mean, just about 10 minutes ago in the green room, I found out my mother passed away.  I mean, it's, it's real tough on me, but I'm trying to look at the bright side of things 
[02:30:00]  like, you know, next Mother's Day, that's one less collect call I'll have to make.  Anyway, I'm really, I'm really into the online dating nowadays.  You know, I'm going to these AOL chat rooms, you know, trying to connect with some of the  ladies.  And the other day, I actually kind of hit it off with the girl in this AOL chat room.  So I actually agreed to meet her at her house.  So, you know, I drove out to her house, knocked on her door, and this like 17-year-old girl 
[02:30:30]  answers the door.  And it kind of freaked me out because in the chat room, she told me she was 12.  Well, I thought it would have been car crashed by now.  I actually, I wasn't eating a popsicle either.  I like his humor.  The livery stinks, but I like the jokes.  He's a good boy.  Yes.  Well, I was eating a popsicle stick.  This is kind of off topic, but they actually have jokes.  I was eating a popsicle, not the stick.  I chew on a stick a little, but they have jokes on these sticks, you know? 
[02:31:00]  I mean, it's pretty funny.  Like, what's a dog's favorite hotel?  What?  Red Roof Inn.  That was meant to crash.  You know, I had to get a crash there.  Oh, and finally, in Charlotte, there's this really tough biker bar I went to the first  time, for the first time ever.  You know, I was kind of out of place because I'm not a real tough biker guy, you know,  obviously. 
[02:31:30]  So, I'm in the parking lot.  I'm on my cell phone.  And this, I mean, just complete idiot.  He's riding right for me.  You know, I had to jump out of the way or, you know, or I would have gotten hit.  And, I mean, he stopped.  He kind of apologized, but it just pissed me off.  I was so mad.  I went up to this guy.  I punched him in the face so hard that he fell out of his wheelchair.  I really messed up the setup there.  That was...  Thank you.  All right.  Let's see.  I like to make werewolf movies. 
[02:32:00]  It was good subject matter.  I mean, I like that.  It was miscarriage, mother's dead, pedophilia, and cripple.  Right.  I'm not being sarcastic either.  I mean, I mean that.  We got to get off the air as far as this side of the show goes.  So, um...  I think our winner's the only person that didn't get crashed.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, we got to go with that.  Yeah, me.  Fan.  Fan will be opening the show.  So, how much money does Ed want? 
[02:32:30]  A little call back.  So, who's our winner?  We didn't hear from everybody.  No, we did hear from everybody.  Yeah, yeah.  We got the chef.  Oh, boy.  They're real memorable if you're looking going, we didn't hear from this guy.  I'm with the chef.  I got to see.  Yeah, Louis is asking for the chef to do some comedy.  In fairness to the comedians, this is the toughest one we've done because you're with  all comedians.  It's really a hard room, man.  Yeah.  Because it's not like in Philadelphia where you had audience members or in D.C. where  you had audiences.  This is all comedy.  This is a rough one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is a rough one. 
[02:33:00]  Tough room.  Yeah.  All right.  So, who's the winner there, Thay?  Hassan Madri is our big winner.  Yeah.  Hassan.  He opens up the show tomorrow night at the PNC.  Yup.  Feeling good about that?  I'm not right now, but when I get out of here, I'm going to scream and maybe kick a homeless  person.  I don't know.  Yeah?  And a little nervous?  I'm just going to get drunk later.  I mean, for the show.  I know.  I'm not going to think about it.  I'm going to continue to drink.  Yeah.  Wake up too hungover to be nervous. 
[02:33:30]  Start drinking again.  You got it.  That's the way.  And then get out there and...  Make my mother proud.  Yeah.  All right.  Very good.  There you go.  The winner of Car Crash Comedy.  Wow.  Can't say his name.  Hassan Madri.  Hassan Madri.  There you go.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Listen, we've got to end this side of the show.  We want to thank Basil T's Brew Pub and Italian Grill.  1171 Hooper Avenue in Tom's River.  Stephen Farley made some great food for everybody today.  The omelets and the steak that everyone enjoyed except for Sam, of course.  We got a surprise for you a little later, Sam. 
[02:34:00]  What do we do?  Something nice.  He gets to put his pants on.  Yeah, you get to put your pants on.  Also, Mick Foley, he's going to be at the PNC tomorrow.  Louis Black's going to be there, of course.  Tickets still available.  Blah, blah, blah.  Special guest comedian, maybe.  Maybe.  Yeah.  We're still trying to figure that out.  All right.  We've got to go.  We're running late.  If you're not joining us at XM, have a great day.  Bye.  You good, Dan?  Yes.  I just wanted to plug Jim's live, spontaneous, hostile takeover this afternoon.  All right.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:34:30]  For everybody listening in New York, Jimmy's doing afternoon drive today.  With Bill Burr.  With Bill Burr.  That's cool.  Magical.  You won't look back on this and go, really, it sucked.  Are you really?  That'd be good.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  I have a shortwave radio.  I'm sure I can get it.  It'll be really funny stuff.  All right.  We'll be back.  Have a good weekend.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show has had a magic act in fact.  I'm ready now.  Are we on? 
[02:35:00]  September 5th through the 9th.  The 5th through the 9th.  Caroline's Comedy Club.  The Late Shows.  Caroline's, New York.  The phone number there is 212-757-4100.  Caroline's, the best club in the country.  I'm waiting for a star to fall.  And carry on to my arms.  That's where you belong in my arms, baby.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[02:36:00]  Roll on the road.  Show on the road.  True bogey, everyone.  True bogey.  Doing a great job.  Over here at XM Satellite Radio.  Radio.  Radio.  A bunch of things still to do before we get out of here for a week.  Of course, you know, we'll be at the show tomorrow night, but after that, it's vacation time. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Go to NorthJersey.com for an Opie and Anthony article on the comedy tour.  Opie and Anthony Test Boundaries.  I just read that.  Is it good?  I didn't like it.  Yeah, it's an article, all right.  You didn't like it?  Why?  Because they mentioned a New Jersey native Rich Voss.  Yeah.  Did they really?  It says Jersey guy, Rich Voss or something.  Jersey guy.  It's a Jersey guy.  Oh, yeah.  The duo second annual traveling virus tour featuring Bob Saget, Louis C.K., and Jersey guy Rich Voss. 
[02:37:00]  I'd like to smash this no show listening to bitch right in their gums.  With the heel of my boot.  That's a positive article on the tour, though.  There you go.  I'm going to read it for yourself.  NorthJersey.com.  Louis Black in studio.  One of the many comedians.  Testing Boundaries.  Huh?  You mean the comedy show is Testing Boundaries?  Uh, I, you know, what boundary is that?  Yeah, boy.  Ten established comics who I would pay a ton of money to see. 
[02:37:30]  Ooh, what a test.  Boy, it's an exhausting.  Testing Boundaries was the last segment.  Yeah.  Yeah.  On regular radio.  That's Testing Boundaries.  That's Testing Boundaries.  That's testing everything.  If we had a whole show of those comedians, then you're certainly testing some patience.  There's a guy, I'm down there, so a few of the guys are downstairs, and one of the guys,  this is the second time he'd ever been up in front of people.  I'm going, you're insane.  Oh, wow.  You're clinically insane.  Yeah, I was thinking there were a couple of guys that probably just were like, hey, 
[02:38:00]  I kind of want to get out there on stage in front of some people, so I'll just come up.  Hey, God bless them for trying, man.  My friends tell me I'm funny.  And it's a tough gig because, again, the other ones we've had have had regular audiences  plus us.  So when you're with all comedians, that's a rough gig, man.  Yeah, tough.  Tough shit.  Tough room.  Tough shit.  Oh, yeah.  It's just tough.  Well, it's what we used to do.  You know, you're on at one in the morning, and who has Snicky Snack, and you go, God damn. 
[02:38:30]  And there's three guys out there who are in the same position, and you're just, it's brutal.  Doing late night at the Strip.  Yeah.  Like 11.45, 12 o'clock.  Like, fucking Lucio would never give me spots.  And one guy was funny.  He goes, you didn't car crash me last time I did that joke.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yes.  He has, it's a good joke, but he did it already.  He did the same thing.  He's contingent upon catching you off guard.  And Lewis is enjoying an omelet, thanks to Basil T's there. 
[02:39:00]  It's good food, man.  And Tom's River.  I think we're done with Sam, right?  Yeah, Sam did good.  We have something nice for Sam.  Where's Sam?  Don't we?  We actually do, yeah.  We're all going to just brutally rape him.  The WWE has sent other stuff for Sam.  Aw.  Some more swag.  I mean, no, other guys on the show, they're in the barrel or under the bus, and then that's  it.  But with Sam, we have to give him something afterwards.  Because he's a spoiled little brat. 
[02:39:30]  He is.  You can tell by listening to his mom.  Yeah.  Do you think Sam was spoiled, and that's why he learned that if he went yucky, yucky, and  didn't eat, he would get what he wanted?  Yeah.  I think so, too.  I don't think so.  Mom, his little baby doesn't have to eat that.  He said he was born for me to spoil.  Yeah.  She was just playing it up for the air.  She's not.  God made him.  Lewis.  Yeah, really.  He likes to spoil.  I bet he does, yeah.  I bet he does.  He never ate a girl's ass, though.  Yeah, he really?  Which is communistic, as far as I'm concerned.  A kid wants all the benefits of this country, and yet doesn't want to chip in. 
[02:40:00]  That's phenomenal.  The definition of communism is eating ass.  Well, why is Luis Guzman wearing the same shirt he was wearing here?  I guess he has a bunch of them.  I hope so.  Or maybe that was taped.  Who knows?  I don't know.  That was the bra that was in the restaurant we were in in Georgetown.  Oh, yeah.  Something in Julie?  Yeah.  Mike and Julie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She couldn't get a table.  Yeah, good.  Well, she didn't like the one they were going to give her, which was on the end.  Oh.  Bitch, we had a call on the morning show.  E-Rock, what do we got for Sam, courtesy of the WWE? 
[02:40:30]  They sent over a couple more t-shirts.  Ah.  Ooh.  What are they of?  Another SummerSlam shirt and Sam's official WWE logo t-shirt.  Oh, look how shiny it is.  Ooh, that's nice.  Wow.  The silvery, shiny logo there.  Would you wear that one, Sam?  Sure.  I'll wear it to the virus show tomorrow.  Okay.  Nice.  WWE really went all out.  Wow.  Two t-shirts.  Yeah.  And I'm going to get to Sam's 16 hours with a nutritional psychology. 
[02:41:00]  They sent over a...  A parking voucher.  A insulated glass Smackdown bottle for Sam when he has his milk.  Oh, it's a baby bottle.  Aw.  It looks like a dildo.  It really does.  I don't get this, but it's a popcorn and fountain glass WWE set.  French time.  Who's coming up with their merchandising?  That's unbelievable.  It certainly is.  Literally.  I can't believe they sent that. 
[02:41:30]  I don't even sell that on MySpace.  MySpace.  And finally, Sam has a ticket to SummerSlam.  Oh.  Aw.  Aw.  Aw.  Aw.  Aw.  Ticket?  Aw.  Ticket.  Yeah.  He's got to go by himself?  Yeah.  Oh, that's cool.  If he'd been able to choke down the food, he might have gotten two tickets.  And they also gave, I believe, a coupon for one medium or small beverage.  Jesus, Vince.  What?  Why one?  Well, they sent another ticket, but that one was addressed to me. 
[02:42:00]  Eric, give him the ticket.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  One for Eric, one for Sam.  So you guys got to go together?  Yeah, why not?  I was going to suggest that, but I think it would be more appropriate if him and his girlfriend  went.  Oh, I don't want to take away Eric SummerSlam.  Why would you give away your ticket?  Yeah, because Eric likes.  I think it means more to him.  E-Rock likes the wrestling as well.  He's a big fan.  E-Rock does like wrestling.  He just wants to be loved by these guys.  You don't need these guys to love you.  You fucking are invaluable on this show.  Not that I don't like Sam's girl. 
[02:42:30]  She sounds like Linda Blair.  I think she's great.  But not creepy Linda Blair.  Captain Howdy.  Yeah, she's fantastic.  Nice Linda Blair before all the shenanigans.  Before, yeah.  I think E-Rock kind of wants to go.  E-Rock's a tremendous wrestling fan.  Well, Sam, would you go with E-Rock or is that a drag?  Be honest.  You'd rather take Jess.  I understand.  Does she like wrestling?  She doesn't like sit there and watch it without me, but she's into it.  She tolerates it. 
[02:43:00]  She would go because that's what you do when you're in love with Sam.  You kind of have to spoil him.  She has fun at the live shows, all the fireworks and bright colors.  Pageantry.  Pageantry.  The pageantry.  The pageantry.  Is she retarded?  I know.  With all the mentions, why couldn't WWE give us like four tickets?  A pair for E-Rock, who's a huge fan, and a pair for Sam, that's a huge fan.  They can both bring their broads.  Yeah.  And what's interesting about those tickets, you're actually not in the place.  You're watching it on closed circle.  Like the old Ali bar. 
[02:43:30]  What?  No, that's just how it came.  What kind of ticket is it?  What kind of seat?  Apparently, it's very close.  You're near the corner of the ring.  That sounds pretty cool.  Doesn't that sound cool to you too, E-Rock?  Yeah, but I'd rather him and his girlfriend go.  This is, please, this is too gay for me.  E-Rock just wants to be loved.  Yeah, what a guy.  What is that about?  E-Rock wants to be loved.  He wants to have something to hold over Sam.  You know, if you get the ticket, if you take the ticket and you take those two boxes,  whatever that is, a popcorn box? 
[02:44:00]  A popcorn box.  And glasses, yeah.  That is unbelievable.  What do you guys want to do?  I mean, I shouldn't, it's none of my business.  What do you guys want to do?  This is, you know, prizes for me, so it's not up to me to.  You don't want to go with it.  E-Rock's just trying to make him feel good.  Like, dude, I gave you my best to Jerry.  E-Rock wants.  My best to Jerry albums.  My spot.  I gave up my spot next to Jerry.  So he is the king of comedy.  Do you want to go to this? 
[02:44:30]  E-Rock wants to feel a little love from maybe some of the guys around here.  And Sam flat out doesn't want to go with E-Rock.  I can read this one easy.  Well, E-Rock, how do you feel?  It's about you two.  If there were other tickets, yeah, I would go.  But there's only two.  So what are you going to feel?  E-Rock is, like, picturing him and Sam, you know, kind of walking up to the arena there,  talking about what match they can't wait to see.  And then it's just quiet and awkward.  Yeah, and then they get beers together, you know. 
[02:45:00]  There's a good, like, suplex, and they high-five each other.  Yeah, you know.  Do you see him super fly?  Dude, yeah.  Dude, high-fiving, just being buddies, making fun of everybody else around here together.  Yeah.  Even Sam laughed at that one as impossible.  Well, figure it out, guys, because you're killing me.  Just so you know. 
[02:45:30]  Seriously, if you can, maybe we can get somebody in, a negotiator, if we can work this out.  All right, they'll figure it out.  She has to go to binding arbitration.  WWE, though, god damn, man, we gave you a lot of publicity.  Yeah, you could have.  A lot of promotion for your SummerSlam.  Maybe they can send over a couple of more tickets for E-Rock and his lovely gal.  Yeah, then you can do a whole episode on which tickets are better.  Right, because that'll happen.  By the way, someone from Israel is making fun of you there, Lewis. 
[02:46:00]  David B. writes, close circuit.  Thanks for the 1970s reference, Lewis.  But, you know, tell that asshole from Israel.  That's right.  That that still exists here.  That's right.  They've lost the capability.  Smuck.  Are you kidding me?  There's still close circuit.  Fuck you.  Fuck you twice.  Lewis has to go at 10, but we have one more thing to do.  Rap Wars.  Rap Wars.  Thanks.  Have you noticed that we actually prepare for our radio show nowadays? 
[02:46:30]  Like the old days.  Slow down with nowadays.  You meant today.  Yeah.  Wow.  I was trying to show off.  Well, it's good.  It's the last day before vacation.  You want to kind of bring them back.  We're getting really good at it now.  Just when they're ready to give up on us, you're talking, we, like, stack the deck.  Yeah.  Wow.  They've got segments.  Wow.  You know what?  They are taking this thing seriously. 
[02:47:00]  Bronx Johnny.  Hi, Johnny.  Has entered the studio.  All right.  Bronx Johnny gives this some cred.  Yes.  Bronx Johnny is going to be the.  Why don't we have his walk-on music?  We didn't get it from Ron and Fez.  Bronx Johnny used to get coffee for us, and we didn't see the talent.  And then he goes over to another radio show, and he's a huge star.  We were stupid.  Now he comes back as a celebrity.  We were stupid.  Yep.  There he is.  He's got theme music and everything.  Bronx Johnny in the house, Lewis.  Very nice.  Are you impressed? 
[02:47:30]  I am impressed.  I mean, this is really.  So far, it's a step up from the last segment.  The ticket segment.  The ticket segment was a big get for everybody today.  I'll be discussing that on all the fan sites all day, all weekend long.  What's up, Bronx Johnny?  Chilling, man.  Chilling.  How y'all doing?  We're doing all right.  I like your hairstyle.  That shit is crack, man.  What's wrong with it?  I like it.  It's crack. 
[02:48:00]  It's a good thing.  I woke up and came to work.  That's what it is.  It's nice, man.  It looks fancy, B.  Looks fancy, B.  What about Lewis?  Lewis is Lewis, man.  That's that man right there.  Daily Show know that good stuff.  I dig that.  Yeah.  He's a star.  He is a star.  He's very confident on the mic now.  He's a shy guy when we had him.  Is that right?  No, he's this big thing.  Well, that's because you step.  I have a tendency to just step on people.  Well, you know.  Squash it.  A little creativity comes into the room and you go, let's have a car crash. 
[02:48:30]  Let's throw him out the window.  You've matured.  Well, we have a rap war that's about to begin.  Excellent.  Yeah.  How did this start?  Well, like, what the hell happened?  Way back.  Way back.  Way back.  Before there was radio.  In the day.  Before there was radio.  We got Butcher in studio, right, Butcher?  Good evening.  Butcher pretty much made fun of chemistry.  Chemistry does some stuff for the show.  Who does good stuff for us?  I think it's good, but Butcher, who knows better, I guess, says it sucks.  Wow. 
[02:49:00]  So I was not too happy with a verse that he did over the Drew Boogie song.  What's the deal, Drew?  What's up?  K-Pasa.  Yeah, I wasn't too impressed with Kem's verse, so I made a comment to E-Rock and here we are  in rap war.  Wow.  What's more blasphemous than two white kids having a rap war?  Exactly.  It's two white guys rapping.  And Joe Boogie's gonna, like, you know, throw down the beats, yo.  Attaboy.  Was that good?  Terrific.  You know any street talk there, Lewis? 
[02:49:30]  No.  How about this?  Drew's gonna get this joint cooking.  All right.  So where's Kem's tree?  Let's get Kem's tree in here.  I'm not good with the street rap.  Shit's a-brewin'.  Kem's tree.  Yeah.  By the way, Bronx Johnny does, like, the porn reviews for Ronda Fez, and it's great stuff.  Who's your favorite porn chick?  Right now, Jenna Hayes.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Good choice.  Yeah?  What's so special about her?  She went, uh, AVN last year.  She went best oral, I think. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, she got that.  She's a good girl.  She squirts sometimes, too.  She does anal.  Look at everything.  Oh, yeah?  That's the mouth.  That's Jordan's girlfriend.  That's cool.  I love that.  Oh.  What's up, Kem's tree?  K-Pos, a Kem.  Hi.  Sup, sup.  What's up, what's up?  There he is.  See, we don't know this stuff.  How's it going?  Good.  LeBron's Johnny, what's the craziest porn you've watched for Ronda Fez?  Uh, Prouty Service Animal was a 24-  Nah, actually, the Milk Nympho one.  What?  It's a Milk Nympho porn. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, that's the one I heard you reviewing, man.  Milk Nympho.  I was laughing my ass off.  That shit was hilarious.  Milk Nympho.  Yeah, explain it to Louis.  Uh, basically, Louis, uh, it's some nice, fancy girls.  They take, uh, basically, like, air pumpers.  Mm-hmm.  They put the air pumpers in their ass, but the gag to that is it has milk inside the  pumper.  They pump their ass full of milk.  That's not the end of it, though.  But I know, but I'm just revving up.  That's not the end of it, though.  That would be silly if that ended there. 
[02:51:00]  The girl's nice enough to take it out of her ass, and then, uh, the chick, I don't know  how the fuck she does it, squirts the milk out of her ass into the other girl's mouth,  and then they proceed to fuck on.  It's pretty good stuff, man.  Wow.  Wow, that does sound like a hell of a film.  It does.  Louis, you ever have a girl do that for you?  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's, you know, first off, unlike Sam, I'm not a big milk drinker.  Uh, but no, I don't felch.  That is, uh, I'm not a felch guy.  That is home, uh, whole milk.  Yeah.  I ruined it by saying home, but whole milk. 
[02:51:30]  Whole milk.  You're a big porn fan, man.  Yeah, pretty much, man.  Yeah, he's the guy.  He's the go-to guy.  Uh, probably, uh, the dude that does the Sopornos, Joe Stagliano.  Oh, John Stagliano.  John, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nice cock?  I'm not really into the cock portion of it, but what the man handles it?  I was gonna ask, you know, nice cock.  I think a real man could judge if his cock is nice.  Is it me?  What?  You ever see the fashionistas? 
[02:52:00]  Oh, hell yeah.  Rock Russell Freddy.  Shit, that's a mean motherfucker right there.  Rock Russell's a man.  Rock Russell's an animal.  Wait, what's that about?  It's, uh, European stuff, basically.  Well, they got a lot of American chicks, but they just, uh, I think they went on, like,  LSD or some shit when they filmed it.  It's a lot of crazy shit, man.  It's about a fashion director, and it's very well shot, and, uh, it's like a real movie.  It's like, uh, it was like a fucking epic, and, you know, Rock Russell Freddy's in it  and Belladonna.  It's really good.  It's great fucking.  It's really good.  I've never heard of it.  All right.  Yeah, it's hot. 
[02:52:30]  Belladonna.  You ever see where he's fucking those girls, they're all wearing, like, the red cat suits, with,  like, the ass is hanging out, and he's just, Rocko is deep-dicking him.  Rocko's a fucking animal.  He just puts an asshole in her mouth, and he goes, lick, lick for me dirty, lick dirty,  lick dirty, dirty.  Oh, fuck.  Not his ass is dirty.  He just calls them dirty.  Yeah, of course.  He makes them suck.  He was fucking one girl, and he stuck his foot in her mouth.  Rocko, he's everything I want to be.  He's a big cock.  It always stays hard, and he humiliates them, and they come.  Lewis, you into that deep-dicking? 
[02:53:00]  Uh, no.  Oh, not while I have an omelet in my mouth.  Oh, deep-dicking.  Oh, deep-dicking.  All right.  Well, I like that.  Bronx Johnny brings some credibility to this whole thing, because I don't think we're good  judges of rap, to tell you the truth.  I've heard some stuff from both ears that I liked, and some stuff I didn't like from  both ears.  That's a good one.  I don't know.  There's just a couple of things.  Oh.  You know, Chemistry, what was it?  What song didn't I like that Chemistry did?  Oh, I don't know. 
[02:53:30]  You'll probably remember.  I always remember things that people don't like that I did.  Huh?  Steve the Bear.  I wasn't a fan of the Steve the Bear song.  Oh, boy.  And?  I'm sorry.  I just thought it was too, like, cutesy to be laughed to.  What's your favorite thing you've sent in, Chemistry?  Probably the OA Virus song.  We have that?  Yeah, that was a good one.  It was for oavirus.com, which is, I don't know if you guys are still promoting that one.  Probably not.  Yeah, they probably hate us, too, now.  Probably don't.  That guy just put up bits?  We don't support anything. 
[02:54:00]  Half the websites that have our name in them hate us.  Some are run by pedophiles, allegedly.  Some are run by...  I have no idea.  Yeah, we lost one of our main guys to some pedophilia.  I don't know what happened.  From what I hear, it was all trumped-up charges, as they say.  Trumped-up.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  But, um...  We don't know.  Ooh.  Cool.  I hope it's the one I've file traded with.  Here's to me.  When he's out sometime next year, we'll ask him. 
[02:54:30]  Ah, we'll see.  We'll get to the bottom of that one.  We'll see.  Wow.  All right.  What talent contest will he be in?  It's really been, like, Ted Max Amateur Hour.  That's for the Israeli.  That's correct.  Yeah.  Good.  You went back even further.  Yeah, that's it.  I can say, yeah, because I'm old.  That's it.  You want to do a Texaco star theater joke?  Go ahead, Lewis.  You know you want to say it.  You never know, though.  It'll just feel good coming out.  We both know what he is.  Go ahead.  Get his wife. 
[02:55:00]  I can't wait to see Lewis tomorrow night, man.  I can't wait.  I haven't seen your comedy in a while.  Yeah.  Who follows Otto and George?  How do you follow them?  They've been doing it.  Bobby Kelly.  Yeah.  Patrice.  Because everyone's doing 20 minutes.  Right.  No one's doing more.  So everyone has been following everybody.  I mean, it really is amazing.  Yeah, we're just one of the few guys I know.  Yeah, that I would really like.  Yeah, we haven't had any.  I mean, everybody else, like, yeah.  You know, everybody else, it's like, you know, we all do it.  So it's like, you know, it's fun.  You know, whoever. 
[02:55:30]  It's weird.  No one has had a problem following anyone.  It's strange how it's working out.  Yeah.  Yeah, no, because that's a good group.  It's not like.  Pete actually tries to kind of, you know, figure it out.  He tries to figure out the formula backstage to see who fits with who and all that.  So, yeah, you're going to kill tomorrow.  Yeah.  That'll be fun.  All right, Drew, you got a mic?  What do we do here?  What's the rules of rap wars?  One, two.  All right.  One, two, yo.  We need.  You've got to be the judge because look at this. 
[02:56:00]  This is like clown college here.  What was the last time these guys.  Are you kidding me?  He's laying down the beats and he's judging.  That's right.  Bronx Johnny.  No, Bronx is.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, Bronx Johnny will judge.  He's laying down the beats.  I thought.  I was going to give him the prize and we hadn't even started rapping.  And if we need another judge, you know, look out.  The chef knows a thing or two about that.  That's right.  It's a freaking three ring circus in here today.  This is going to be like eight mile, only completely different.  Yeah. 
[02:56:30]  Miracle mile.  Sam knows a little bit about rap, right?  Yeah.  You want help, bud?  Bronx Johnny?  You want a crew or what?  Do you want help?  Yeah, why not?  All right.  There you go.  And how about Roland?  Roland, you know rap?  Yeah.  He knows Elvis.  Oh, look at him.  He throws his hands up like he either knew it or he didn't.  This guy makes love to the camera.  You've never seen a man.  Oh, and the microphone.  Roland, when I walked in, he's like, go butcher.  When I'm walking through the...  Damn right.  Oh.  Roland, comment. 
[02:57:00]  Smack.  Yeah.  What?  Comment.  Wait, didn't you say go butcher when I walked in the building?  That's because Roland knows his shit.  I was waiting for Saget, so you were my least of my problem.  All right, all right.  I know, buddy.  I mean, you're not a celebrity, so...  Is that right?  Roland.  I've never seen Roland do this.  You want to get in the battle?  I guess there was a...  Yeah, what are you?  I just got owned by Roland.  Get in the battle.  There's no battle.  I just get annoyed because...  Roland, can you sing a little Elvis just for Lewis? 
[02:57:30]  He did this on the anniversary of the king's death last week.  And notice the complete lack of confidence.  Yes.  And he sure...  We're the lahara.  We're the lahara.  That was a song with lahara.  That was good.  What the fuck was that?  You were in the ghetto, man.  That was a hell of a reference.  We're suspicious minds.  Let's go.  There's a baby born right now in the ghetto. 
[02:58:00]  In the ghetto.  Wow.  That's good.  It's like Cartman.  It's phenomenal.  Well, tell him what nationality you are because he won't believe it.  I'm Mexican.  He's Mexican.  Mexican.  No X.  Just T and something.  T.  He's spelled like czar.  He says it like he's spelled czar.  Czar.  Czar.  Mexican.  All right.  So you don't know about rap? 
[02:58:30]  In the ghetto.  In the ghetto.  All right.  Springsteen, but not rap.  Oh.  Yes.  Do you sing any Bruce?  Born in the USA?  Born in glory days.  Yeah.  Sing a little Bruce.  Glory days.  Well, that was.  Wow.  I'm serious.  That nails music.  Is this better than the ticket segment?  No.  This is spectacular.  This is radio.  I just want to tell the listeners out there because we got to see it.  That wasn't Springsteen. 
[02:59:00]  No.  Because we got to see it so I could know it wasn't.  But I want to tell the listeners, don't flood the station out thinking Bruce is going  to walk downstairs.  You want to make it perfectly clear.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  How about a little more, Bruce?  I mean, you got to give us a little more.  Let's see a song.  Jungle Land.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Um, tonight in Jungle Land, whoa.  I'm sorry. 
[02:59:30]  I'm really sorry that they missed the arm.  The arm, yeah.  He really pumped his arm like he was rocking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, Roland, you rule.  Yeah.  Just rule.  I like your Elvis video.  It's very creepy.  It's up on.  Yeah, it's a good one.  It's up on all the websites.  My friends are forwarding it to him.  They forwarded it to my mom.  Oh, they did?  Really?  Yeah, and she wrote, why?  Why?  No, I've got to say something, guys.  I have to, as much as I want to stay, I have to go to the periodontist. 
[03:00:00]  And that's another throwback word.  The periodontist.  Yes, people who deal with your gums.  It's going to be a big, big treat for me.  Seriously, I would rather watch the rap wars than do this, but I have to go.  What are they doing?  What's wrong with your gums?  What is wrong with my, what is right with them?  Are they fucked up?  It's not, it's just to go, it's a cleaning.  The Israeli guy says you're lying and you're going to, because you have the croup.  You have the whooping cough, something from 1950. 
[03:00:30]  No, they go in, you know, you go in and they dig away.  You go in, you reach a certain, but you reach a certain age, here's the deal.  They didn't tell us any, all they tell us, you brush your teeth.  And then, then eventually in my lifetime, by the time I'm like in the 30s, they go, oh,  you know, you should floss.  Well, a little late.  A little late.  Yeah, in order to brush every day, they had to get you into the habit when you were like  three.  Yeah.  And then in your 30s, you're supposed to like, oh, now you got to floss. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, and then they, now they're bringing other equipment in, you know, use a Derek.  Can I tell you a horror story?  Derek.  I have a, I have a friend on radio, his got so bad, they had to slice his gum in quarters  and lift it up to clean it out to save his teeth.  Oh, yeah.  Scrape underneath.  And that's, I'm going to just tell you.  But they had to cut the gum so they could fold it up.  Unless, unless.  And they had to do a quarter at a time.  Oh, yeah.  That's, that's your future.  You know that, right?  It's your future.  Fine.  What was his, what was his radio name? 
[03:01:30]  Lovely breath?  No, it's unbelievable.  It's just, it's, there's a whole.  Could you imagine that procedure though?  Oh, no.  He had to go in four different times.  He got the, the top half done one time, had to like heal for two weeks.  Then he had to get it done again.  And then they did the bottom.  Yeah.  Four times.  To prevent the thing that they never talk about, which is bone loss.  That's the whole deal there.  Which adds to cancer.  It leads to cancer.  Yeah.  Does it?  Yeah.  Some kind of cancer.  Or it leads to them, you know, just teeth dropping out.  You know.  Yeah.  You know, now I'm nauseous. 
[03:02:00]  Are your teeth okay?  They're sort of okay.  How's your prostate?  My prostate is spectacular.  Like a grape.  It's wonderful.  Thank you.  Guys, this was great.  I hope, yes, Lewis.  Oh, yeah, no.  I'm serious.  A lot of fun having you here with all the shenanigans going on and hijinks.  Now that I know that you're just into contests and into a whole kind of a new.  I think we scared Lewis off.  No more arrests.  Oh, no.  We scared Lewis off.  How do you get arrested?  I was feeding people steak.  Lewis was one of those guys.  He had to take a break from the show. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, yeah.  And we fully understand.  We don't blame him.  No.  But let's be honest with each other.  You had to take a break from the show.  You're like, well, this is not good for me anymore.  You know when they tell people that are alcoholics not to associate with your former friends?  Right.  That's what Lewis had to do.  He was like kind of getting addicted and into the crowd here.  And it was fucking him up.  So he had to get away for a while.  And then his people had to sit him down and go, read this stuff.  This is who you're hanging with.  My people never said anything.  And I don't even have people. 
[03:03:00]  But, you know, the thing that was amazing to me was that I think it was like fear of success.  Because you guys were just about to break wide open.  And then I kind of had to go do stuff.  We keep fucking it up, though.  I know you do.  But that's perfect.  It's like go back to.  That's what we are.  We're a stupid game.  Roll the dice.  One, two, three, four.  Go back to start.  Oh, shit.  What did we do?  Unbelievable.  Well, Lewis, thank you for coming in.  See you tomorrow night, man.  Great day for you to come in.  I can't wait.  Yes, tomorrow night.  Loads of fun. 
[03:03:30]  And, you know, don't be a stranger.  I won't.  Now that you're in major motion pictures and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  It's true, man.  Nothing compared to, you know, Johnny Rab's hard cocked vicious seven on planet Xenon with the milk felcher.  It's been a great time, guys.  Thanks.  Thank you, Lewis.  You need to promote anything else?  Nah.  Websites, you're all good?  Okay.  Just want to make sure you get your stuff out there.  Please, you know, just don't bother me.  All right.  Lewis doesn't want to be bothered.  All right, man.  See you in the back.  Thank you, Lewis.  Come on tonight at the PNC with everybody else. 
[03:04:00]  It's going to be a great show tomorrow.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of fun.  We've only got two shows left, so we're-  Lewis makes me happy.  We're feeling it, man.  Yeah.  We're feeling the energy.  All right.  Should we start it with the rap?  Yeah, let's do this.  How is this going to work?  You guys want to stand up?  You got some beats there.  I'm standing, definitely.  And, yeah, you got to stand up.  Kenny, you know anything about rap?  I used to rap people with my slapper.  Yo, yo, yo.  Clubby's in the house.  He's in the hizzy. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, no.  He's rapping.  Yo, B, what up?  You could be butchers like Flavor Flav.  Yeah, Kenny, you're my hype man.  You could be the hype man, see?  Just open up with, yeah, boy.  I'm down with that.  I love you, Kenny.  Oh, but you want to talk about parking some more?  No, no.  I was talking hotels, but we're rapping now.  Yeah, yeah.  You sure you don't want to talk about parking anymore?  Because Tim made a sweeper.  Yeah, let's talk parking for a minute.  Parking. 
[03:05:00]  Parking.  Parking lot.  Parking.  There'll be plenty of handicapped spots for you.  Parking.  You know, they usually, in every parking lot, they accommodate handicapped people.  You're in the parking, Kenny.  Parking.  Parking.  Parking.  Parking.  Parking. 
[03:05:30]  If he can't afford tickets, how's he going to pay for the parking?  You got to pay for parking?  How much is parking?  How much is parking?  Parking lot.  How much is parking?  I pay parking.  What about the parking that might not be?  And the gas and the tolls.  Not too many cripples come to our show.  I'm sure he'll get a good spot.  Open at me.  There you go.  There you go.  Wow.  Thanks, Tim.  Kenny featured prominently.  People are asking if Roland got laid because he's sounding too confident. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  Like something might have happened.  Cocky.  In his personal life.  Do you want to check it?  Yeah.  Roland.  All right.  So, Drew, what are you going to do?  I got beats here.  We're going to run 30 seconds.  Okay.  30 seconds each round.  Once the 30 seconds ends up, I will stop the music.  And then you have to stop.  But it should be enough to get your point across, I'm sure, without hearing too much shit from the listeners.  Are you guys freestyling or, you know, you got some shit? 
[03:06:30]  I'm in war.  I came with ammo.  You came with some ammo?  Yeah, I came with some ammo.  All right.  All right.  So, my man is correct.  Word up, son.  Me and Kenny don't front.  Hey, that's not fair.  We ain't no posers.  Word.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  If Butch has got a hype man, then, you know, we got to give chemistry somebody.  I say we give him Roland.  Rapping E-Rock?  Roland.  Roland.  Or E-Rock.  E-Rock.  It's got to be E-Rock.  Let's get him Renee.  Well, let's try out Roland as a hype man.  Just listen to chemistry's high-pitched voice. 
[03:07:00]  How's he ever going to make it?  Renee's got a lower voice than chemistry's got.  Come on, Renee.  Hey, come on in and be Kem's hype man.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Oh, there she goes.  Look, all smiles.  There you go.  Hype up chemistry.  Give him a hip-hop and a bit-bop.  Is there a little love in the air here?  Oh.  No, don't.  Don't come in.  You're a scum.  Oh, my God.  Bronx, Johnny, you like all the cockiness?  I'm trying to feel out the judge here.  I dig the arrogance, man. 
[03:07:30]  You dig that in the battle, man.  Yeah?  Hell yeah.  All right.  Mad confident.  What up, Kem?  Wait, we got to get a hype?  Of course, eye contact we've made.  We got to get a hype, man, for chemistry.  It's because you keep looking away.  I'm shaking in my boots, Kem.  He don't have to look away.  He's backed by a .38.  Word.  Has Rowan got guns?  E-Rock, can you be chemistry's hype, man?  MC Dry Harry.  For shizzle. 
[03:08:00]  For frizzle.  Come on, let's spit some beets.  Kenny.  All right, Roland's coming back up.  All right.  How are we going to do this?  Spit some beets.  Want to flip a coin?  Yeah, flip a coin to see who goes first. 
[03:08:30]  We're just trying to get chemistry on life.  No, no, no.  Let them go first.  Wow.  Yeah, absolutely.  Then Kenny's the coin.  Yeah.  Feeling quite confident.  Maybe chemistry doesn't want to go first.  I don't give a shit.  Yeah, see?  You don't give a shit.  See, it's all about...  Let him go first.  We saved the best for last.  Okay.  Wow, okay.  All right, where's Roland?  Oh, Roland, we're doing a show.  Can we go through the first?  He's rolling, rolling, rolling down the hall. 
[03:09:00]  What kind of D, Kenny?  This is XM.  Yeah, it is.  All right.  All right, so we'll start with what?  Can we start?  Yeah, there we go.  All right, you got 30 seconds to play it.  Do whatever you can over this thing.  Yep.  You ready?  Say a prayer first.  Bryce Johnny, you listening right?  Yeah, do us.  All right.  All right.  Come on, yo, yo.  Hey, yo, butcher. 
[03:09:30]  You know I'm winning this contest.  You're fucked.  You might as well be wearing a prom dress.  Obviously, you're obsessed with my lyrical process.  Or you wouldn't have been the object of all that boring-ass nonsense.  Your weak comment's not as funny as bomb threats.  You don't know the time.  I'm gonna run to the clock sets.  Yo, don't speak.  You're fucking weak.  I get deep over any fucking beat.  Yo, I beat that ass, but yo, I really ain't a fighter.  I'm an emcee.  I'd rather beat your ass with what I rate up.  I ain't a part-time rhymer.  I'm a hard-line reciter. 
[03:10:00]  And I let you suck me off, but I heard you're just a biter, weak faggot.  Hey, man.  Wow.  That was great.  He comes out of the gate strong.  Hey, Roland, get in here.  Come out strong.  That's eight-mile bullshit.  Roland, get over there.  You're, uh...  No, Bryce Johnny needs his own mic.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bryce Johnny's a star, man.  Roland.  Yeah.  Why can't we hear Roland on that mic?  Yeah, do it as Elvis.  All right, hold on.  He rock. 
[03:10:30]  What happened, E?  Oh, they're using it.  They're using what happened?  Oh, so he's taking Bryce Johnny's mic.  All right, listen, Roland.  Yes.  Your whole job is you're the hype man for chemistry.  Kenny's the hype man for Butcher.  Yeah, so what you got?  Ugh.  Thanks, Brilly Harry, yo.  I'm Brilly Harry, yo.  Yeah.  Word.  Oh, word.  What a disgrace.  I'm a pussy here. 
[03:11:00]  Don't talk about chem like that, Drew.  That's fucked up.  Oh, stop it.  Well, now, uh, chemistry just busted out some rhymes, and I think you did a great job.  Church, I felt that.  All right.  Oh, church.  But now you got to hype chemistry, and you got to, like, tell Butcher, like, you know,  take that, yo.  Come on.  Uh, yeah, take that, Butcher.  I still love you, Roland.  You're never intimidating.  Yeah.  Yeah, something like that.  Yeah, your mama, Butcher.  Word.  Whoa.  No, you didn't.  Stick to my balls.  No.  You didn't.  No, you didn't.  What did he say to me?  What did you say? 
[03:11:30]  Your mama's thinking my balls.  That's horrible, bro.  Yo.  Why would my mom do that?  Eat your crack, yo.  Eden?  All right, Kenny, why don't you hype up your man, Butcher.  Enough said.  Done.  All right, roll it, Drew.  Fuck it.  That's all you have, yo?  Ah, yeah.  Let's do it.  Check.  Check.  Biggie.  Yeah, all right.  All right, all right, all right.  Check it.  Check it.  Check it.  Yo.  Hey, yo.  Hey, yo.  Chemistry, it wasn't meant to be.  I tear a hole in elementary raps mentally. 
[03:12:00]  All you doing is tempting me, so pay attention, see.  I'm the motherfucking rapper that you pretend to be.  I stay completely fresh.  The butch will eat your flesh.  While dropping bigger bombs than the ones on Jill Nicolini's chest.  It's going to be hard to settle.  Don't get harsh, fellow.  Or you're going to catch in the same place Opie picks up marshmallows.  It's going to be hard to last.  I'm cold and as hard as cash.  Every verse of yours to me ends in a car crash.  Nothing that you could give me.  You the rapping version of Timmy.  And I guarantee your endings won't be as happy as Jimmy.  Yeah.  Oh, damn. 
[03:12:30]  All sorts of show references.  That's how you do a rap with show references.  Is that right?  Oh.  And a plug at the end.  And a plug.  Jimmy likes that.  All right.  I'd like to hear this first round is done from Bronx Johnny.  What'd you think?  Do we want to hear from the hype men beforehand?  Or we're done with the hype?  Oh, okay.  Let's hear from the hype guys.  I'm surprised Kenny didn't jump in.  Don't believe the hype is a sequel.  Yo, Timmy Rinds. 
[03:13:00]  What?  He busted it.  Shit.  He busted them lyrics.  Shit.  Go back home to New Jersey, yo.  Yeah.  All right.  That's devastating Roland.  Yeah.  He told him to go and pay a toll.  Butcher, they're saying you're over modular a little bit.  So you know.  I'm awful.  I yell a lot.  I'll back the mic up.  They heard it, though, but it's just a little over-modulated.  And, Bronch Johnny, what do you think? 
[03:13:30]  First impressions?  Butcher was kind of cracking that round.  He didn't repeat himself.  I think the kid right here, Kim.  Yeah, he repeated himself a couple times there.  Butcher kept it real, man.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, see the winner.  Butcher, booyah.  So what, first round to Butcher?  First round to Butcher.  Oh, boy.  But Kim did a nice job.  He did decent, I guess.  Yeah, for a rookie.  Yeah.  That's a rookie move.  What are we doing?  First one of three?  He's very green chemistry.  Kenny's just throwing the smack out. 
[03:14:00]  And Roland's not even fucking defending his man.  Yeah, you got a hype.  You better yell.  Why?  You don't yell at him.  You want us to write for you?  Jesus.  I don't know.  You got to defend your guy and talk some smack back to Kenny.  Comment on his run.  Comment on Kenny's dry hair and stuff.  It doesn't matter where you take it.  I don't know.  Well, you need a better conditioner.  It's hair so dry that what?  Conditioner.  I don't know.  You better check yourself before you wreck yourself. 
[03:14:30]  Kenny's destroying you, Roland.  Wow.  He's very intimidating.  I know it's not about Kenny and Roland, but it's a little side contest going on.  Check yourself.  Yeah.  Because if you ain't never been to the ghetto, you better never come to the ghetto because  you can't handle the ghetto.  Roland?  Bean pie, my brother?  I got nothing. 
[03:15:00]  He got chitlins.  All right.  Don't just stand there.  Bust a move?  What?  Turn the screen on.  Bust a move?  Eric, you help him with bright stuff.  That's what he did.  He just helped me.  It was awful.  That's good.  Well, then you have nothing.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah.  All you say is Kenny.  Yeah.  Come on.  We got to get this done so I can drink a 40.  Smoke a blunt. 
[03:15:30]  Wow.  Fucking Kenny, man.  He's nowhere.  He's talking some shit, man.  How do I know this is going to end with us getting fired?  All right.  I'm down with Nate Dogg.  Wait, my phone's ringing, I think.  Uh-oh.  I'm making a drug deal.  Oh, someone's hitting you on the hip.  Yeah.  You beat me to it.  All right, here we go.  Second round, we go back to chemistry.  Chemistry's down one to nothing. 
[03:16:00]  Okay, I'll check it out.  I'll send someone down.  What?  I don't know.  There's two more people downstairs that come up for the show.  What?  Barbara and Lee something?  Two more people.  I don't know anything about it.  Are they chicks?  I don't know.  I'm going to send somebody down and check it out because I'm too busy up here now.  With my pimp hands, it's strong.  Oh, man.  Bronx Johnny's loving you.  Yeah, make sure Bronx Johnny has a mic if you're not going to battle. 
[03:16:30]  I think Kenny's going to win this battle.  I like his shit.  Yeah, he likes it.  I'm an OG.  Once I beat Kem, I'm going to battle Kenny.  Is that right?  Yeah, word.  You got it.  Kenny, you want to try a little freestyle over a jubilee?  You know I was DJ Jazzy Jew.  Oh, God.  All right, here we go.  So we go to the next one, right?  Yep.  All right, here's chemistry.  Back to chemistry.  All right, here we go.  Yo, damn right, yo. 
[03:17:00]  Yo, you know I'm a real MC.  Why you nodding your head like you ain't fucking feeling me?  Yo, look at me.  I chopped up and cooked the MC.  I got the recipe.  You better vote for chemistry.  Yo, fuck it.  That's how I do.  You know I got a record.  This is how I do it.  Don't even need the last fucking seconds.  That's how I step to this.  It's real.  You know it's live.  I had to kick it real.  Yo, it's no job.  Yo, it's face on the pavement.  Thin line between weak and whack, and you erased it.  I'm bitch slapping rappers. 
[03:17:30]  Quit begging for props.  You may not be off the hook.  In fact, I got you shook like Michael J. Fox.  I'll give you the J. Fox line.  All right.  That was good.  I'm stupid.  Most of them made up.  I don't know how this works.  Really?  Fuck yeah.  You know what I like, too?  He's adhering to the beats a little better than Butcher.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I didn't even hear it, but it stunk.  Like, Butcher's just, like, running, running off as fast as he can. 
[03:18:00]  Can I actually get more beat in the headphones if possible?  Can you turn it up a little bit?  Oh, it's a technical glitch.  No, no, no.  I'll go with the...  Steve's working with your headphones.  Yeah, he's working with your headphones.  I'll work with your headphones.  All right, all right.  That's cool.  I wanted to try to direct traffic to your eardrums.  Yes.  Do you mind two big foundry logos over your ears?  My eardrums are more important.  Big flaming gears.  Roland?  I used cogs from Cogswell Cogs.  Roland, your guy just, you know, finished there.  Hype him a bit.  What'd you think?  Come on, hype him up. 
[03:18:30]  Hype him, yo.  Push his shit be straight wood.  What?  Push his shit.  You know what straight wood is?  That's a boner, B.  If I got wood, I got a boner.  This is so stupid, man.  Oh, this stinks.  We've had a...  You too can't hype.  We've had a really good show today, and Kenny's just stealing it at the end here.  Yeah, who's better than me? 
[03:19:00]  No one.  Thank you.  All right.  Drew, I'm ready when you are.  It's time for Butcher.  Here we go.  Yeah.  Let's go get him, guys.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  All right.  Hey.  Cam, you ain't got nothing to say.  I heard your rap, boy.  How you gonna get to me with that nerdy-ass voice?  I'll take all three of your fans, get groupies to fuck me while you're outside in the lobby  docking with Pat Duffy.  I'll spit fire, step to me, and get burned. 
[03:19:30]  You ain't worthy enough to be my fucking intern.  So intern, I'm gonna smash you, abuse you, and trash you.  Hold on, man.  Message boards can hate me.  I can give a fuck.  I'll take the hate with a smile.  I ain't in no denial.  You fucking liar.  Oh, that's all, Cam.  All, Cam.  That was terrible.  Terrible.  Nice, right?  Oh, damn.  Damn, yo.  What now, yo?  Damn, yo, what happened?  Kenny's gotta save me on that one.  What's up, Ken?  At least I know who my daddy is, yo.  He had a little brain fart. 
[03:20:00]  He's gonna get his street cred back.  He's gonna get his street cred back.  At least I know who my daddy is.  Oh!  He's a baby daddy.  He throws mad cock around.  Come back in line.  Some food stamps.  Some food stamps, yo.  No.  I thought Butcher was gonna run away with him.  Butcher was cranking at that point.  I think.  He was cranking away.  Poor daddy.  And then something happened.  You know, he lost it in a turn.  I get boggled in the mind. 
[03:20:30]  You were speeding, and then you hit the wall.  She got his mind on his money, and his money on his mind.  Yeah, right?  That's right.  All right, I'm gonna help these two out here.  I'm gonna slow the beats down so that they can think.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Give me...  Ah, okay.  Well, let's go to Bronx Johnny.  Kim ate his food on that one, so...  Yeah, huh?  He did what?  He ate his food.  What's that mean?  It depends.  Like, if you're talking about street language, somebody sliced your face and ramen, you got  your shit handed to you. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, he was served.  Oh, ate his food is not good.  No, not in any kind of way.  That's like eating your balls in comedy.  Oh, okay, okay, yeah.  Eat your balls.  So, we got a 1-1.  We got a tie.  First one of three wins.  Damn!  All right, we'll go back to chemistry.  Any hype?  This is the showdown!  Roland?  Roland?  Hype your man!  Do it, yo.  Your shit sounds like a Kia.  Oh.  Let's go. 
[03:21:30]  This can be a motherfuckin' Benzo?  You're comparing the Kia to a Benzo, but...  LOL.  LOL.  God, is he classic, man.  This can be the...  Come on, here's the fucking thing, man.  This is hilarious.  All right, it's 1-1.  Here we go.  Back to chemistry.  Yep.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo, you busting me? 
[03:22:00]  It's like Jimmy wearing a belly button ring.  It ain't happening.  You buzzing like bees and can't sting.  Fuck your rapping.  You're too sloppy.  Why you got a copy?  Off my notes.  You wanna leapfrog?  Hop up and croak.  Yo, I pop up and broke off.  Most soft wannabees.  Yo.  I straight up got in your mom's dungarees.  I cut my knees.  I'm giving your mother what she needs.  You're the poster boy for why crack whores shouldn't breed.  Yo.  There's no way you convince me you're straight.  Cause bitch rappers like you, they're getting bricked in the ace. 
[03:22:30]  Ooh, okay.  Hey, hey.  All right.  I'm rolling.  Yeah, that's the shit.  I can't hear this beat at all.  Yeah.  It's all right.  At least we don't have to party Happy Meals on Layaway.  Oh, he got you, yo.  Oh, Kenny.  Come on, Burlington Co-Factory.  Oh, Kenny.  Come on, Burlington Co-Factory.  Speak.  Oh.  Nah, I just, I wanna just savor the moment for Butcher now to take this competition. 
[03:23:00]  Oh, you got nothing.  So the silence will be golden.  He fucking owned you.  He really did.  You pwned it?  You got pwned.  You want Sam to write for you, too?  No.  All right.  I don't need no shitty writer.  Oh, wow.  Damn.  All right.  That was a good one.  Johnny, comment?  That shit was kind of weak, so let's see what Butcher got.  Oh, okay.  Wow, how do you know?  I thought it was pretty good.  Yeah, I thought it was fat.  No, it made no sense. 
[03:23:30]  Did you feel that him being salty about the other gentleman's mother was out of the line?  I would have added, but it was a weak line, man.  You didn't like the line about the dungarees?  No, no, that's a bull.  Why are you still laughing?  Probably the only person who used dungarees in a rhyme.  Oh, really?  I like that line.  I thought he was just going old school.  I don't know any better.  Damn!  What's wrong with him?  You've just been pwned.  Pwned.  Oh, yeah?  I'm battling ant now, too. 
[03:24:00]  Me and ant are battling.  Kenny and Roland are battling.  Butch and chemistry are battling.  Where's my werewolf shit, yo?  Damn!  You've just been pwned.  Us.  I like to make werewolf movies.  Movies.  So now whose turn is it?  Yeah, yo.  Butch you have to go?  This could be an easy victory for Butch.  Butch is what Bronx Johnny's saying.  The grand finale.  Could be.  Not the grand finale. 
[03:24:30]  We're doing the first one to three.  All he's got to do is...  The first three are the best three rounds.  Well, you don't have enough for five?  Yeah, I could go.  Good.  Yeah, we'll go to three.  I don't care, man.  Whatever.  I'm ready when you are, Drew.  All right, here we go.  All right, all right.  Yo.  Yo, Kem, you don't do nothing but lie through bars. 
[03:25:00]  Chemistry must be short for Kem is trying too hard.  You know you're in the wrong place to be right now.  So when you step to me, you get cut quicker than Steve's eyebrows.  You only getting air time because I said your verse sucked.  And looking at my clock, your 15 minutes is about up.  So make up an excuse.  Tell them you're having a crappy day.  Before I leave your pathetic ass looking like Tammy Faye.  My grammar spray in every known direction to smite you.  And in fuel to the thing that I used to ignite you.  Oh, having a shit day.  Here you are.  Yeah, having a shit day. 
[03:25:30]  Damn, bro.  Damn, that's going to be it.  You had it.  You just had to stay away from him, bro.  I was going to go, you're having a shit day.  Your voice is a bit gay.  You need someone more on your level.  Go battle with Big A.  That's where that was going to end.  Yeah, if you didn't fuck him.  I fucked it up, man.  I still thought it was good, though.  I mean, I still thought it was good.  Let's get some hype from the hype man, and then we'll go to Brian Shawnee.  His lyrics are very smart, if you could just say them.  Yeah.  Oh, Kenny's losing confidence.  Oh, no. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  Your delivery's atrocious.  You're delivering your lines like you got multiple sclerosis.  Exactly.  Not multiple, just a couple of them.  Thank you, man.  I shall use that soon.  Roland?  Yeah, that's horrific.  There you go.  That's it?  Kenny's losing a little confidence in his boy here.  He'll make it up to me. 
[03:26:30]  What happened?  Now you're just like, he's going from talking smack to, I think we can pull out of this alive.  We may take seconds.  We're going to be okay.  People are starting to call you J-Z-Z.  Z-Z.  I love the haters, man.  I love the haters.  Give me all the hate, man.  It's just as good as giving me the love.  Roland?  Yeah.  The Butch.  These are all four.  Yeah, yeah.  Say it.  The difference between you and a pizza, pizza can be a family of four.  I don't know. 
[03:27:00]  You lost me.  And then he goes, I don't know.  All right, let's go to Bronx Johnny.  I don't know.  Time for a ruling here.  Yeah.  If Butch could have finished, I would have given him that.  He was piping him pretty good.  But Kim gets it because of the strength he finished.  Gotcha.  Oh, man.  We got a two-to-one lead for chemistry, right?  Wow.  One more chemistry wins.  Rap Wars.  And these are like technicalities.  Because you're busting it at first.  This is serious business, Ant.  Yeah.  Do we have time to do suck cock for K-Rock today?  Oh, the phone lines are ringing. 
[03:27:30]  Let's do one hello.  God, they're going through them too fast today.  Oh, fuck.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Okay.  Just get to my line.  Shh.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Am I actually number two named you this time?  Hello.  Hello.  K-Rock?  Hello.  Is this K-Rock? 
[03:28:00]  That's what I'm wondering.  I think the lines got crossed.  I think we got two listeners on the phone.  Hello.  Yes.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  K-Rock.  K-Rock.  What number am I?  Hello?  Hello.  Hello.  K-Rock.  Hi.  Am I 92? 
[03:28:30]  Damn it.  All right.  Wasn't working.  Didn't work today.  It happened.  All right.  All right.  So where are we at?  Two to one.  Chemistry's in the lead.  Butcher leads off this one, no?  Butcher?  I could, but I'll let Kem go.  It's Kem's turn.  It's Kem's turn.  All right.  Here we go.  Kem wins one more round.  He wins Rap Wars.  I'd let Butch go because he's behind anyway.  But what's the order that's supposed to be?  I don't know.  Kem goes next.  Okay.  Nah, Kem go next.  Kem go next.  Kem go next.  Yo, yo. 
[03:29:00]  I'm steadily recycling.  MC's biting what I write again.  It's me, my mic, my pen.  Separate the mice and men.  Mention every tension just to light the mic.  And when the ice and bends and chrome rims are showing off the price of men.  I frighten the crowd.  I throw the mic, swing out, and slide the banister.  Smash camera, stop the bling down.  Faggot flaunting with his rings out.  Talk out his big mouth.  About a big house, a big couch, a thick gown.  Once he bricked out and broke out, scattered, crept up in his sight for Sunky's lifeboat.  Fighters nowadays walk tight ropes.  This great white hope sights through the night scope. 
[03:29:30]  The corner of the market and target your price.  Quote, I gloat.  Oh, okay.  Uh-oh.  That was pretty good.  That was very generic.  It stunk, Anthony.  Tell the truth.  It was generic.  Generic.  You know, he's just talking about like any white boy did this, that, and the other thing.  Roland, what do you think of your man there?  Uh, it was deep.  It's a deep shit.  Thanks, Roland.  Deep shit. 
[03:30:00]  Kim's doing the right thing.  He's pulling out the written stuff.  I suggest Butcher do the same.  It's a better comparison.  Oh, you can tell that was all written nice, right?  Drew, I'm ready to roll when you are, man.  All right, here we go.  Butcher.  Yeah, rock and roll.  Yeah.  Crank it up.  When I start smitting, don't turn the beat down.  Just leave it all the way up, man.  Leave it.  Yeah.  Yeah, boost it up a little more.  Check, check, check.  Check, check.  A little more, a little more, a little more.  Yo, Cam.  You want to put up a challenge? 
[03:30:30]  Your rhymes are lame.  I'm going nuts like I was blowing lines of cane.  My frame of mind, homie, I was made to rhyme.  I'll punch a dude off of the clock because you a waste of time.  Face the times.  You're living in the fakest lie.  So I'm going to walk the earth like jewels, find my place to die.  You, you can't get a glimpse in because this motherfucker's as stupid as Jessica Simpson.  He's flinching.  I'm throwing hits at a distance.  We're no assistance.  All your lyrics is misprints.  For instance, watch me kidnap your princess and run while you're staying on stand like a witness. 
[03:31:00]  I thought the beat died in the middle of that.  Yeah.  That's the way it goes.  But yeah.  That wasn't me.  Nah, it's all good.  It's all good.  Roland.  What's up, Roland?  Only thing Bush is blowing is these nuts.  Oh, Roland.  You didn't.  I did.  Okay.  No, I want to see Roland get sucked off.  Why not? 
[03:31:30]  That's what you come back with?  Kenny ran at it.  If you look at the way this started, Kenny, you were fly.  I know.  I was super fly.  Now you're just shit.  Now I'm just shaft.  You're so dumb.  You root for the white people and roots.  Why, Roland?  Oh, man.  What the fuck is that?  That was actually true.  Yeah, of course he did.  Well, um.  The expert. 
[03:32:00]  Bronx Johnny.  I give it a butcher on that one.  Wow.  And chemistry agrees?  Even with the-  It was a little stronger.  Like, he's picking up, though.  Chemistry is getting a lot better.  His confidence is coming up.  He's doing better.  But a butcher had him on that one.  Even with the miscue in the middle there?  I think on content.  Yeah.  You know.  The miscue happens.  Yeah.  It's not like the beat kind of, you know.  No, no, no.  That's the way the beat goes.  It drops out at certain parts.  Yeah.  Muffle.  Muffle.  No, but I'm saying he just didn't know.  So it's-  He didn't know.  Butcher's got to be able to follow. 
[03:32:30]  I got you.  I got you.  Butcher knows the song.  This is perfect.  We got a 2-2 tie.  This is it right here.  Do we add anything to it?  Yeah.  Or is it just a regular round or what?  A regular round.  Okay.  Drew knows.  Butcher, your flow's so weak you can't wipe the sweat off my balls.  Whoa, Roland.  Your delivery is flawless, Roland.  Roland.  So he gets high pitch right at the end of every sentence.  Yeah.  My ball.  Wow.  Roland is kicking you. 
[03:33:00]  I know.  I'm just enjoying it.  Ask him.  Roland, where the deacon at?  What?  My deacon in your mouth.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Butcher ref's like a pregnant welfare mama.  People who are on Pal Talk are saying Bronx Johnny's got a little action on this game.  He's like one of those NBA refs.  Nah.  A lot of people say that maybe this thing should be over right now.  Bronx Johnny's known for keeping it real.  So you're saying Ken paid old Johnny?  I don't know. 
[03:33:30]  Why don't you use omelet in a sentence?  Omlet that one slide.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ha ha.  All right.  You close it up, Kim.  Do your thing.  Hold on.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  All right.  Here we go.  Yo.  Yo.  Fuck your carbon copy raps.  Your sloppy raps.  Fuck the snobby way you rack.  Yo.  Fuck your recycled tracks.  Recycling mob deep. 
[03:34:00]  Screaming yo done every five seconds.  You said who wanted battle?  Yo.  I came to set it off.  Words that better cross.  This funnel of sinking deep.  To the undertow beneath the speech.  Constructed to reach you.  I'll teach this fool.  He's mingling.  Platinum ropes dangling.  Getting tight jiggy.  And he's barely even hanging in.  Like pussy I'm banging and get beat up.  For running your mouth.  You talking stunning but in battles.  Came up short and out of luck.  You got stuck by this white kid in plain view.  The same became your distance styles.  Yo.  He like.  I'm saying yo.  What you're saying is you made a hoe.  Out of yourself running your mouth. 
[03:34:30]  I can't make a flow.  To save your life.  You know I'm nice.  Don't front.  You got burnt like a Dutch.  Your style must be out to lunch.  Yeah.  Whoa.  Okay.  He was talking some shit that time.  Yeah.  He was man.  But Roland.  Roland feeling confident about your man?  Yeah.  Good.  Yeah.  Good.  Roland you're just mad because I'm styling on you.  That just sounds like a crust.  Crusty asshole.  Crust of.  You can't even read. 
[03:35:00]  His writing style.  A crust of.  Wonder bread.  What?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Butcher you ready?  Yeah.  Let's go.  All right.  Let's go.  Last rap.  This is it.  This is for the winner of Rap Wars.  Crank it man.  Crank it.  Crank it.  Crank it.  Crank it.  Crank it.  Yeah. 
[03:35:30]  I'm going to risk it on this one.  Chem your rhymes are wacky.  Nothing short of a hack.  I could give a flying fuck if nobody got my back.  I take that hate with a smile.  They try and put me on trial.  Because I blow their brains out the back of the head like private pile.  I'll leave them smoking like Ron Bennington.  Hang them upside down on the crucifix.  You full of shit.  I'm boiling like water up in the teapot.  Give them more bullshit than E-Rock.  And when the rhyme is over, I'll prove you ain't done shit to me.  And let ONA raise my hand for the victory. 
[03:36:00]  So suck my balls.  You ain't nothing in my house.  So get the fuck out.  You a crappy rock.  Oh, you were so close at the end there.  What was the last line that you tripped on?  Yo, I was, I fucked up.  It was all freestyle.  If he gets that, if he gets this one, he was lucky.  Freestyle.  If he gets it, he's lucky.  But I'll take it out with a smile if that's what happens.  What's that rolling?  Butch is standing like P Diddy with a stutter.  P Diddy is what I did in the toilet. 
[03:36:30]  P Diddy.  People are suggesting that Butcher butch is the end of every rhyme he can't see.  Oh, man, I get all hyped up in the middle and I lose myself.  Just let me remind everybody, Big Boy made a doody. 
[03:37:00]  Butcher raps like I talk.  Oh, that's the best one so far.  Oh, damn.  And chemistry raps like I look.  What?  All right.  He raps dry.  Dry.  Yeah.  Tall.  Stupid.  Oh, but you mean like stupid.  Yeah, ugly.  Let's say stupid.  Stupid.  Well, here we go.  It's up to Bronx Johnny. 
[03:37:30]  We have a 2-2 tie.  It's time to declare who won this thing.  I'm going to give it a butcher.  I hear you.  Wow.  What?  Wow.  Listen, listen, listen.  You want to make it really fair.  You want to make it really fair.  I'll give you one more.  We can do it.  I'll give you one more.  Wow.  Why?  Hold on.  Let's go to Bronx Johnny.  No, you got it.  You won.  You won.  Bronx Johnny, what was the reasoning behind that one?  Well, like, in the middle of Kim's shit, I just kind of like...  Fell asleep? 
[03:38:00]  A little bit.  He got a little boring.  A little too repetitive because he sounds like he did in his last run.  Yeah.  About the same shit.  Then Butch, even though he can't finish, it sounded tough to like right about the fucking  end until he tripped on his own shit.  Yeah.  Thank you, Johnny.  So, it's more important to just have some shit going and really get some attention, even  if you fuck the end up, than it is to, like, get him all the rhymes in there and straight  and kind of, you know, zone out.  You could rhyme all your shit together, but if it's garbage, it's going to sound like garbage. 
[03:38:30]  I'd rather have somebody, like, semi-fuck up, but at least it's decent.  Mm-hmm.  So, basically, Bronx Johnny's been paying close attention.  Yeah.  And Bronx Johnny's shit is correct.  Johnny's coming correct, son.  Chemistry, how do you feel about that?  That's all right.  I mean, he's the judge.  Like a loser.  Like a loser.  Roland, you want to back your man up or something?  Kenny's so dumb, his prostate's bigger than his brain, yo.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[03:39:00]  Oh, he's right.  My prostate is bigger than my brain.  I got nothing to say about that.  So is mine.  Don't swear to Kenny.  We're hoping that you would freestyle over a beat, Kenny, to end this thing.  Oh, wow.  You think you could freestyle a little over a beat?  Come on, Kenny.  Look at Jimmy.  Don't do it to everybody.  It's nice.  It's been such a good show.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Yeah, no, no, no, no, no.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right. 
[03:39:30]  We usually go on vacation wondering if we're coming back to a job.  Yeah, I see where Jimmy's going.  Oh, yeah, there you go.  Let's leave him wanting more.  Yeah, well.  I know Kenny well enough to know that he would just panic.  And my ego's getting bigger.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  We're out of work.  What rhymes with bigger?  Oh, Jesus.  Put an over-explainer joke.  Two Jews walk into a bar, you know, because they have all the money.  They own it.  Good point.  No, it's kosher. 
[03:40:00]  I'm Kenny Kicker.  So, Butch, do you feel good about the victory?  Yo, man.  I'm a little confused.  If we do one more, is it going to fuck up the flow of the show?  No, I mean.  Because next time, this shit will be strategic.  Strategic.  Roland?  That's my big work for you, yo.  How about we just run on the same beat and don't stop?  And I'll just go, and then when I'm done fucking up, he can do whatever the fuck he wants.  And then Johnny can tell him that I'm better. 
[03:40:30]  I don't feel good about this victory.  No?  Well, maybe I don't know about this rap war thing.  I don't know.  Let me change your mind.  But chemistry got through all his rhymes, so that doesn't mean anything in rap wars?  It's like, if you're going by a scorecard or some shit, yeah, he'd get some points and  stuff, but...  Ken was also spitting the same shit that he's probably been spitting for the last fucking  two and a half years already.  So that's why he was able to get through it.  Wow.  All the shit I have is at least two days old.  So memorization is kind of...  I'm not trying to take away from you, by the way, Butch.  I'm just trying to educate myself.  Absolutely, man. 
[03:41:00]  Because I don't know this shit.  To settle you, if we could do...  If we'll do one more than that.  You guys want to do just one for fun?  Roland?  Butch's victory be so tainted, I found it between Johnny's balls and asshole.  Tainted?  Why did you find it between Johnny's balls and asshole?  Yeah.  What were you doing there?  I just read this.  He assumes no responsibility.  No, of course not.  I read this.  I don't know.  I've been killing it.  I might as well tell people I've been reading the whole time. 
[03:41:30]  Jesus.  Roland.  All right.  So what are we doing?  Chills.  We doing one last one for the clincher?  Sure.  Yeah.  Just for fun.  No, chemistry.  Is it for fun?  He won.  He got it.  Chemistry?  Come on, chem.  We got you there.  This is an exhibition, yo.  He was at Wisely Holmes.  Yeah, do an exhibition or something.  But I respect chemistry for taking the word of the...  Do you feel you're going to be on the other stuff or no?  Yeah, I can think of a song.  This one, if you ask me, even though I take your word for it, you're the final word, the  judge and stuff, but I see this as being very close, very controversial finish to this. 
[03:42:00]  Absolutely.  Yeah, you know.  It always is with creative things.  Of course.  I'm looking at an Ali Frazier thing here.  We might have to do it again.  It'll have to be a rematch.  We might have to do it again.  Mm-hmm.  Because there's a lot of people saying bullshit, but then there's a lot of people agreeing  with Bronx Johnny.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Give me the haters.  Give me the haters.  No, I mean, they're agreeing with Bronx Johnny, meaning you won, Butcher.  So it's all over the place.  It's all good.  I can't wait to read...  Butcher...  You don't hate the player.  Hate the game.  Where's the message board?  Give me the message board, people. 
[03:42:30]  Whose pubic hair is on your chin?  It's mine, actually.  Oh, all right.  I can suck my arm.  He went, oh, all right.  I can't roll.  You looked at Sam like, why didn't you figure that out?  We're having this.  I'm fucking rolling.  This has been a pleasant surprise, man.  Holy shit.  All right, so we'll hand it to...  I guess we'll give it to Butcher.  Thank you.  There's a little bit of controversy.  Chemistry is graceful.  We'll have to figure out...  We can do it again.  Johnny's made his decision.  We'll have to do it again.  We'll have to get the hype men together.  Hell yeah.  They'll study their shit. 
[03:43:00]  We'll get some costumes and shit.  Huh?  We'll get some costumes.  Yeah, costumes.  We'll get Kenny with a clock on them.  Yeah, Kevin.  Big ass sunglasses.  Yeah.  And a Kango.  I'll wear it to the bathroom.  I'm so ashamed to be part of this.  I absolutely agree with you.  And when 5-0 pull me over, I'll get my restoration out of the glove department.  He's running racks now. 
[03:43:30]  Oh, God damn.  Hey, Kenny, put on the Bulls jersey.  I apologize to chemistry and Butcher making a mockery of this whole thing.  God damn.  Kenny should do his b-boy stance, too.  This is Opie's.  Oh, is it?  He doesn't want...  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Oh.  Don't wear my shit, yo.  Oh.  Everyone's trying to be street.  All right. 
[03:44:00]  A little exhibition to end the show today.  What are you guys doing?  It's up for you guys.  Deenie, deenie.  Yeah, man.  Check.  Check.  This is for all the people who hate me.  You're all faggots.  Oh.  We're going to beat up a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Check.  Oh.  I'm down and grotesque, cannibal-esque.  Giving palpitations, vikers falling out.  These rappers banging their chest.  I'm back in the flesh, subtracting the rest.  No guy can protect.  You best be macking more than just a whack in the vest. 
[03:44:30]  I'm wielding like an axe when I'm vexed.  Put rap to the test.  Slaughter in my opponent.  Say, yo, this crack is the best.  I take a hit and pass to the left.  I'm passing the test.  Pass my arrest.  Moving too fast.  I pass my death.  Reincarnate the threat so they never forget.  I smoke that bomb and blow that smog right back to the rest.  I keep an eye on my homies.  Turn my back to the rest.  While this fucking poser catches a flare slap to the chest.  Or to wake him up.  Spend too much time, I'm under arrest.  By the time he comes to, buried under the rest.  I got way too many rhymes.  Too much time to invest.  When I'm applying pressure, blow your fucking lungs out your vest.  Cause there's nothing I love more than the taste of raw flesh. 
[03:45:00]  Blood splattered on the wall.  I paint a portrait of death.  I'm the baddest motherfucker coming out of New York.  Got a size 15 booth.  This sucker's selling me short.  Equipment with a metal tip.  They quick with the metal grip.  So sick it'll make your shit start blowing like C4.  This so-called rapper's depressing is Eeyore.  Never seen a white boy spit like this before.  Am I too good to ignore?  You too stupid to pay attention.  Scoring other rappers on spelling and comprehension.  I'm schooling them.  Only one thing I forgot to mention.  If you fuck it up, the penalty ain't detention.  It's expulsion.  Leaving motherfuckers convulsing. 
[03:45:30]  With a flow that looks sicker than Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.  Six million ways to die.  So I chose.  Made it six million and one with your eyes closed.  Recommend you keep them shut.  Cause the last MC that kept to me got burnt so bad,  he left looking like pizza to hut.  I show my face on the block.  You shove your face in the cock.  My raps will turn apart.  Respond to a vacant lot.  I'm faking not.  I fake a lot.  I treat rapping like driving.  And when I park, I'm gonna take your spot.  So take your shot.  I'm spitting all my raps point blank.  I'm with nothing but a mic.  You and your boys, I spank.  I'm blowing shit the fuck up.  You just get shit popping.  Alright, I'll leave it at that. 
[03:46:00]  Yo, White Line Highway.  My God.  Why did you do that in the battle?  Yeah.  I didn't want to do written shit in the battle.  I thought we were, I didn't want to do shit that I've been, I've done that for a while  and I was kind of, that's a rhyme I've used before.  I didn't want to, I want to come with something fresh, something I could insult the chem with.  Yeah, funky fresh.  A rhyme you've used before, but millions of people haven't heard it on 92.3.  Are you crazy?  I mean, XM.  Well, that's the thing, that's the one that we played last time I was on XM, so I didn't  want to do it again. 
[03:46:30]  Ah, gotcha.  But, you know, I figured, because they've played a song for me before and that was the  song that they played, so.  Roland?  Butcher.  E-Rock be so fat when he sits around the house, he sits around the house.  Oh!  Now he's just going out to everybody.  You're causing a war.  We might have to do Yo Mama between Kenny and Roland.  Damn.  Hilarious.  All right, time for Cam.  Yo. 
[03:47:00]  Lyrical content flowing like faucets.  And I bet he's diarrhea, rapper spits soft shit.  Whether I get into his wake or his bedside, remember one thing, the lead didn't fly.  I took off my ring, some chemistry, came to sting on any rapper.  Getting loose, biting on your apples is the only way you got juice.  He pours it in a goblet, his crew drank from it.  His chemistry whipping that ass?  You'll bank on it.  I rank on it in spit words.  Stealing like Pittsburgh.  Click his picture, then return with a thick perm.  The sick term paper I rip can never rectify the need. 
[03:47:30]  For quadrupling the speed of his lips.  I pee.  Napoli, happily, I'm causing catastrophes.  In every apple tree, these crabs are mad at me.  You're actually, they're pissed off.  Screw face and Mr. Mugshots?  Maybe mommy never really hugs you a lot.  But yo, from the front doe, to the back doe, to the wacko.  Scheming for a protocol, line and blow.  Goes to show you, they'll wake you any full escape.  Line for line in every rhyme.  Well, I'm destroying fake ass to break past.  I hit the block and get the cake fast.  I run your cash like pigs with flashlights.  Crash, running from the pigs undercover, stun ya. 
[03:48:00]  I run through sticker bushes, yo, who wants it?  Yeah, see?  How long have you been rapping for, Ken?  Since 91.  Word.  Damn.  Word.  You got some ears on me, man.  I'll give you that.  Now they're giving the mutual respect.  Yeah, nah.  Some respect.  I'm still one, though, so.  Yeah, we give accolades.  Word.  We give accolades.  And kudos.  Fucking kidding. 
[03:48:30]  Roland.  Just say goodbye.  Roland out.  Make money, money.  Make money, money.  Make money, money.  Make money, money.  Take money, money.  Take money, money.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Money, yeah.  I want you to do it again there, Roland.  Yeah.  Roland, what happened?  Roland out.  Make money, money.  Make money, money.  Money.  Money.  Money.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah.  All right.  We got a line of the day or we don't.  Tons.  Do we do it or?  Yeah.  You got them set?  They're all quick.  Really?  Yeah, we'll do a line of the day.  Hey, chemistry, right on, man.  That was awesome.  Butcher, that was awesome.  Yeah, everybody there did a good job, man.  Thank you guys.  Johnny, thank you so much for your street credibility you put toward this because we  don't know shit.  Thanks for having me, man.  We're going to have like ghetto day, man.  We're going to have like these guys do it again.  We're going to have like Club Soda Kenny and Roland do Yo Mama jokes. 
[03:49:30]  We're going to do a whole day of this.  Ghetto day.  I'm going to do it by just staying home and not coming to work.  Okay.  Shut up.  Basil Teas, everyone.  Thank you for the phone, bro.  Thank you.  It was unbelievable.  Yeah, that was off the hook.  Getting into it, see?  Stephen Farley, executive chef.  Seven runner-ups.  You make them mad on me.  Seven runner-up lines of the day?  It's got to be all. 
[03:50:00]  Holy fuck.  We got to get out of here.  It's got to be all Roland and Kenny shit.  No.  Here we go.  Here's your first runner-up line of the day.  At least I know who my daddy is.  Oh!  He's a baby daddy.  He throws mad cock around.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Another runner-up.  Your flow's so weak, you can't wipe the sweat off my balls. 
[03:50:30]  Another runner-up.  Come on, let's spit some beets.  Kenny.  Another runner-up.  The difference between you and a pizza, pizza can feed family a four.  That was it?  Yep.  All right.  Another line of the day?  I'm too busy up here now.  My pimp hand is strong. 
[03:51:00]  Another runner-up line of the day?  Yeah.  I can't hear this beat at all.  Yeah.  It's all right.  At least we don't have to party Happy Meals on Layaway.  Is this the final?  This is it right here.  Runner-up line of the day.  The last one?  All right.  You better check yourself before you wreck yourself.  Wow.  Drew Boogie, thank you so much.  Thank you, Drew.  Great time, man.  Great job, man.
