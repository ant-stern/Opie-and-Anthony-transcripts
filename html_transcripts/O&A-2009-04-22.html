<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie detailing a personal injury (a twisted testicle) and expressing anger over the unauthorized use of their studio by Ron and Fez.  This led to a demand for greater transparency from management. The hosts then played a CD recounting a bizarre tale of a man being anally violated by his wife.  This transitioned into a lengthy discussion of Bill Murray accidentally hitting a woman with a golf ball, focusing on her reaction, Murray's apology, and the hosts' critique of Murray's later comedic work, contrasting it with their appreciation of *Ghostbusters* (though also criticizing its humor and Rick Moranis's comedic style). They also discussed the legal battle surrounding the *Ghostbusters* theme song. The conversation shifted to *Lost*'s controversial airing of a clip show during May sweeps, prompting a broader discussion on the changing media landscape and the importance of software serial numbers.  The Bill Murray story was revisited with additional details before the conversation abruptly moved to Susan Boyle's rise to fame, a $1 million porn offer, and an offensive comparison to a co-worker named Pat, leading to suggestions for a spoof video.  This was followed by a discussion of Shaheen Gorley, a young singer from *Britain's Got Talent*, whose talent was contrasted with Boyle's, again using offensive language to describe Boyle.  The show then covered the arrest of a Craigslist killer, delving into the evidence, speculating on motives, and discussing the reactions of his fiancée, friends, and defense attorney, even mentioning a potential connection to his girlfriend's mother. The show concluded with Opie discussing the uploading of old *Real Rock TV* videos to YouTube and Twitter, detailing the editing process to avoid copyright issues and showing a clip, edited to avoid showing them running a red light.

A substantial portion of the show featured a deep dive into Scorch's public access show, "Pretty Fucking Good TV" (PFG TV), including several clips showcasing its low-budget production and eccentric segments like "Wheel of Meat."  The hosts debated the credibility of Scorch's claims of impending network deals.  This segment included tangents on Oxypowder (a laxative), the Miss California controversy (and the hosts' reaction to her views on gay marriage), a discussion of racial slurs (specifically the word "monkey"), further reminiscing about *Real Rock TV*, a comparison of their windowless studio to Danny's office with a Times Square view, and listener calls sharing humorous analogies used by their former bosses when firing them.  The segment was filmed with Sam capturing behind-the-scenes footage.  Throughout this section, there was frequent use of crude humor and offensive language.

A significant segment featured "PFG TV" again, highlighting the bizarre "Wheel of Meat" segment (involving meat and licking), and showcasing Jeff Lawrence's contribution, which the hosts deemed "pointless fucking garbage."  Scorch's exaggerated claims about his involvement with WWE were heavily disputed. A pre-recorded segment of "Legs Zeppelin" was played, followed by a live appearance by "Puppetry of the Penis," where the hosts discussed HR concerns about inviting female staff due to the sexually explicit nature of the act.  The performance itself involved creating objects and animals from their genitalia, accompanied by crude jokes and laughter.  Their past appearances, including one shortly after 9/11, were also mentioned.  The segment concluded with a crudely-edited audio clip containing graphic sexual language.

A later segment focused on the hosts' and guest Jimmy's reactions to graphic online videos depicting extreme self-mutilation.  Their reactions ranged from disgust to morbid fascination, featuring frequent vulgar language. Bob Kelly's reaction (vomiting) was also discussed. This transitioned into a heated debate on waterboarding, with callers expressing strong opposing views and the hosts engaging in an aggressive exchange with one caller.  Brief updates on Miss California, Stephen Hawking's health, and upcoming guests (Michio Kaku and Yari Coleman) were also given.

The final segment started with a caller's story about giving a book with a Nazi engaged in a sexual act to someone named Kenny. The hosts then discussed Pete Dominick, joking about his sexuality and a potential show appearance.  A search for a porn magazine, possibly "Biggums," ensued.  The discussion returned to waterboarding, including speculation about waterboarding E-Rock.  A graphic recounting of a woman's head injury due to turbulence on a flight followed.  The conversation circled back to pornography, with detailed descriptions of various magazines (Hustler, Penthouse, "Babyface," and the confirmed "Biggums"), including depictions of various sexual acts and a mention of Sandy Kane.  The segment ended with a tease for an upcoming video of the hosts sharing cheese in a drive-thru and a sports blooper featuring an offensive term.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  I've been dealing with a twisted testicle. 
[00:04:00]  She wrote out a prescription that basically said, warm baths, they would look like alligator  eyes popping out of the water.  Notice the best show on TV?  I think it's called Three Sheets.  Where Anthony is in relation to the wind when he's driving.  I have a red light in my bathroom.  Wow.  I'm going to shower with a chick.  You have a red light.  You're always thinking of how you can look a little better. 
[00:04:30]  Exactly.  So I have a blindfold.  I had to go, she comes in.  The Opie and Anthony radio show, the most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  And we're off.  Here we go.  That's good.  Got to adjust everything every morning.  I got some intel that the studio's being used at night.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  Even though they told us that wouldn't be happening, and if it was going to happen, they would 
[00:05:00]  let us know.  Hey, it's your studio.  We're building your studio.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We get it.  Yeah, right.  Sure.  So apparently people come in here, and there's new equipment, and settings are all screen.  And it's not just Ron and Fez, you know.  We mean above and beyond Ron and Fez coming in.  Like at night, there's some kind of crap coming out of this studio.  We've been doing this long enough.  I mean, stop with the bullshitting.  Just tell us. 
[00:05:30]  Just tell us how it is.  And we'll have to just accept that.  And then we deal with it.  Yeah, enough with the bullshit.  Enough with the, uh, you guys were under-marketed and under-appreciated and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Just tell us how it is, and that's it.  Yeah, that's all.  We're not rookies.  We're veterans of this game.  We've been through this.  Right.  Lay it out on the line.  That's right.  Then we know what we got, and then we, uh, we work around that.  Good morning, Dan. 
[00:06:00]  God.  Oh.  What is this?  It's good.  It's good.  Can I, am I giving anything away by even reading this?  Dan just handed me a CD that just says, guy buttfucked by wife.  It's a good little story.  It's not a story.  And Bill Murray hits somebody with a golf ball.  He hits somebody with a golf ball every year.  That was the pro-am that was happening over the weekend, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, is that his, like, thing?  Is that his thing to do?  He's a horrible golfer, and he plays that pro-am every year. 
[00:06:30]  Horrible golfer, is he?  And he...  Yeah.  Oh, I see.  Yes, remember the old days when that was a slang?  And, um, when he's in this pro-am golf tournament, everyone wears helmets and stuff.  Really?  Yeah, because they want to watch Bill Murray, but they don't want to, like, die from being  hit by a golf ball.  Shanking him.  So they got all sorts of football helmets, hockey helmets, motorcycle helmets.  Really?  I guess this woman was just one of the stupid ones that thought Bill Murray could actually 
[00:07:00]  play golf.  Well, they saw him in Caddyshack, so I guess they assumed...  Ever since Caddyshack, which was a million years ago, Bill Murray plays golf, and people  assume he can play golf.  Yeah.  But apparently not.  We could start with this really fast, and then we could see how everyone's nights were.  Sure.  Get some of the personal stuff out of the way.  Nah.  Nah.  Why is comedian Bill Murray on the ground next to this?  Oh, this lady. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, God.  What's her name?  Friggin' voice.  I don't know.  Annoying bitch voice.  It's Jeannie Moe's, or Moss, or whatever.  Why is everybody...  Shut up.  She's the one that got us in trouble for the voyeur bus, so I never forgot her.  She jumped on the voyeur bus.  Oh, yeah.  A rat.  No family rats.  Was interviewing everybody, and we're thinking, wow, good publicity for the Opie and Anthony  show.  We got a CNN reporter on the voyeur bus, where teen girls are getting naked all over Manhattan.  And then she conveniently, what, jumps off the bus right outside City Hall. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, and then runs into the mayor and says, well, what do you think about this?  Yeah, and just plays the tape for the mayor, and next thing you know, all hell broke loose.  Jeannie Moe's was the one that started that nightmare for us.  Why is comedian Bill Murray on the ground next to this woman?  It's fun.  Because he just conked her with a golf ball while teeing off.  I felt this explosion in my head.  Did he hit her between the first and second hole?  Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-da-ba. 
[00:08:30]  I love that joke.  I love it too, actually.  Yeah, she was stung between the first and second hole.  I felt this explosion in my head.  I thought I was having a stroke.  Gail DiMaggio was out in her backyard watching the Outback Pro-Am tournament.  Wow, she wasn't even at the event.  Maybe it's one of those houses on the golf course.  Still.  Then she should be used to it.  I guess.  But, yeah, she's just in her backyard doing some gardening. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, we got a lot of that one.  Watching the Outback Pro-Am tournament, hoping for a close-up view.  Gee, I hope Bill Murray's ball comes on this side.  Next thing you know, Bill Murray himself was at her side apologizing profusely.  How many fingers?  I mean, then he just started comedy routines.  He lifted my shirt.  He gave me belly tickles.  You put your head on your belly like that, and then a person puts their head on my belly  like this.  Before they sent her off to the hospital for a CAT scan and six stitches, Bill helped her 
[00:09:30]  up and worked the crowd.  And he never stopped cracking jokes, even about going to the hospital.  She's going to take this opportunity to have cosmetic surgery done, get her eyes, her ears  pinned back, and just her highlights done.  One city wants to pack all the...  Oh, great.  What a bomb.  This isn't set up right.  Ah, whatever.  See, like I said, everything is tweet.  Wow, Bill Murray not being too funny right there. 
[00:10:00]  I never thought Bill Murray was that funny.  I don't hate him.  I just never thought he was that funny.  You don't think Bill Murray's funny?  I really don't.  I don't bend the minority.  The problem is that he started making too many artsy, weird films.  He's not off-the-cuff funny.  I'll say that.  In his older movies, I found him funny.  Stripes was okay.  SNL.  Stripes, he was okay?  He was great at Stripes.  Dude, John Candy, I thought, was great in Stripes.  Oh, yeah.  Bill Murray was okay.  John Candy is way funnier than Bill Murray.  I would admit that, yes. 
[00:10:30]  Yes.  Yeah, but, you know, Caddyshack was funny.  Caddyshack ruled.  Chinch bugs.  Manganese.  That's a great character, but it's a character.  When he's just Bill Murray, I don't think he's very funny.  I think he's a bitter guy.  He comes up as a bitter guy trying to come off as a funny guy.  Yeah.  I'll say it again.  I saw Ghostbusters recently, and a lot of people put that on their top five funniest movies of all time list.  Yeah. 
[00:11:00]  Not so funny.  Not funny!  I don't know.  It's not so funny anymore.  No.  It doesn't hold up.  I guess it's one of those movies that just doesn't hold up for whatever reason.  I was never a big fan of that movie.  You weren't, right?  That's what I was thinking when I was watching.  I'm like, did I even ever like this movie?  I don't think I like this one.  Was it for the masses, you think?  Ooh.  But I did like the song.  The Rent-Danded.  The Rent-Danded.  The Rent-Danded.  Is it Ray Parker Jr.?  Yes.  And Huey Lewis getting all the money from it, remember? 
[00:11:30]  Oh, yeah.  Because he sued Ray Parker.  And took all his cash.  What song is this?  Uh, it's not I need a new drug, is it?  I want a new drug?  No, I mean, it's the Huey Lewis song, and he sued, and now he gets money from this.  We had Huey in, and he was very happy about that one.  I want a new drug, when it won't make me sick.  Oh, boy.  When it won't, ba-ba-ba, make me feel three feet thick. 
[00:12:00]  Are you a Huey Lewis fan?  Uh, yeah.  As a guilty pleasure when it's on?  Huey Lewis and the News.  It's all right.  This is sports.  Yeah, Huey was big back in the day, as they call it.  Remember that day?  The day?  The day.  Yeah, it was the day, back then.  Well.  Ghostbusters.  Yeah, I didn't find that a good movie.  I'm glad we're on the same page with that one.  Back there.  No.  What about Ghostbusters 2, because I still have that.  Ooh.  No? 
[00:12:30]  Don't watch?  Ooh.  Okay.  No, that's the one with Sigourney Weaver, right?  Well, the first one.  Oh, she was in the first one?  She was in the first.  All right, then.  See?  I don't even know.  What's-his-name was just not funny whatsoever.  Ned Finney!  What's-his-name?  The dude that played the nerd.  Rick Moranis.  I don't think I've ever found Rick Moranis funny.  Harold Ramis.  Harold Ramis was the guy in Stripes, the tall friend of-  Oh, you don't mean him?  No.  I mean Rick Moranis.  Rick Moranis. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Who was the Honey, I Shrunk the Kids guy.  He was down the hall guy.  Ugh.  And he was-  It was horrendous.  Yeah, and he was the two guys on Second City.  Yeah.  The beer guys.  Oh.  I was drinking beer.  Mm-hmm.  Eh?  Eh?  Yeah.  I guess you gotta be Canadian to get that.  Does Travis got info?  Travis.  Well, you know they're making a third one, right?  Oh, then I don't need Steve on Long Island.  I hang up on Steve on Long Island.  What?  A third? 
[00:13:30]  Ghostbusters?  Yep.  All of them are coming back.  Well, of course they're all coming back.  They haven't done anything in the last ten years.  They're doing nothing.  And they're gonna train new Ghostbusters.  And there's also a Ghostbusters video game that's coming out that's actually getting  some pretty good reviews.  Is it on the Wii?  No, I don't know, but I did hear that Rick Moranis refused to do any voice work for it  because he, quote, retired.  From what?  Is he doing the movie?  Is he?  Well, he said that he wasn't doing any voice work for the game.  What an ass. 
[00:14:00]  What do you mean he retired?  Actors don't retire.  From what?  They just don't get parts anymore.  Yeah, he stopped getting work.  Right.  That's called retiring?  So he's trying to spin it.  Ah, I'm retired.  You retire, but you don't determine when you do the business does?  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Travis.  Yeah?  I need a lost update.  Sure.  What's going on tonight?  What shenanigans are they pulling?  No, no, it's not content because it's Lost is on tonight.  This is what I look forward to every goddamn Wednesday. 
[00:14:30]  And what are they doing to their fans tonight?  Tonight is the story of the Oceanic Six.  It's a clip show.  Yep.  It's a clip show.  They're doing a recap show.  It's a repackaged, probably narrated terribly.  Why?  Save a week.  Why?  Because I...  Like, what's the actual reason why?  So that the show can go throughout May and they can hit all of May sweeps. 
[00:15:00]  Through sweeps, yeah.  Oh, so they're milking it.  How about you just put new episodes in there that are really good and we get to watch it?  Or you know how many you're putting out in January, so just figure it out then.  I think their ratings are pretty good.  I think they could afford to throw another good episode in there.  It's the most DVR'd show.  Is it?  And illegally downloaded.  And legally downloaded.  Wow.  Hey, speaking of which, I'm looking up at the screen. 
[00:15:30]  Amazon.com, getting into the movie business, I see.  Oh, is they?  They got 500 movies and TV shows that you could now get through Amazon.com.  Wow.  Was it Amazon.com?  I hope so.  I looked up real fast.  Yeah, you could download them and stuff?  Well, I mean, we're all heading toward just having every single thing ever produced, available.  Downloaded.  On our home system, right?  We're getting there.  You know what I do now? 
[00:16:00]  I haven't bought software like in a store or even online where they send me a disc.  It's all downloadable now.  And I'm talking like not just little things and stuff.  Real software, like that costs a lot of money, software.  Yeah.  And then you just, you know, just download it.  Get it on your computer.  It's there.  And then they could send you the disc also.  But you have it at that second.  That's the worst part is waiting. 
[00:16:30]  It's like, I need this program.  And it's like, you got to wait.  You send for it.  They'll send you the disc in a few days.  It's like, no, I need it right now.  But for older people, not that we're that old, we come from an era where when you buy something, you want to see it in front of you.  You know what I mean?  I see it virtually.  I know.  But I think the kids are okay with that because they've been downloading music and what's not for so long.  But when we bought our music, it was a hard copy. 
[00:17:00]  You needed, you're like, see, I own this.  I bought this.  Now you buy stuff and it's just kind of in your computer.  You know what I mean?  It's just in there.  It's just, you want to be able to hold what you buy.  You know what the most important thing is?  Making sure you write down or at least in some way, shape, or form, keep that goddamn serial number.  Because if you have to reinstall, you can go to the site.  You can re-download some of this stuff. 
[00:17:30]  But if you don't have that serial number, you're screwed.  Because you don't have a disc, you know, loaded or, you know, a jewel case to open up with the sticker in there with the number on it.  So you got to make sure that's like, I learned that the hard way a few times.  Oh, yeah.  Some good programs just like that.  That is the worst.  If you lose your serial number, please call this number.  Oh, forget that.  Oh, please.  The company's out of business.  It's impossible.  It's impossible.  Vince from Bayonne.  Amazon.com has been in the download biz for a while. 
[00:18:00]  Well, I figured as much.  I am.  The story actually is they just added HD downloads yesterday.  HD.  Movies and TV shows.  Here's the second part of the Bill Murray hitting the lady in the head with a golf ball clip.  Ooh.  And what did Dale DiMaggio want for getting hit on the head by Bill Murray's golf ball?  Just an autographed copy of the movie Caddyshack.  At least the only things he goes after in Caddyshack are gophers and flowers. 
[00:18:30]  It's in the hole.  The day after he clunked the lady on the head, Bill Murray was back on the course continuing the tournament.  And this time, all of the course marshals were decked out in hard halves.  Almost two years ago, Murray was stopped for allegedly drinking while driving a golf cart in Sweden.  But there's not the slightest suggestion of drinking this time.  Just a bad drive.  He introduced me as the lady that walked in front of his shot.  Dale has the ball that hit her already autographed by Bill.  Do you want to see the bruise? 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Oh, that's a great idea.  She calls it a happy accident.  And look at that nice deputy taking Bill's hat to clean off a mud splatter.  Better mud than blood, which is what happens when goofball meets golf ball.  Alright, enough. Enough with the references. Enough about the dumb event.  That's the worst news report I've ever heard.  It could be the worst one ever.  She fucking stinks.  Wow, is she bad.  She does those type of reporting a couple times a week easy. 
[00:19:30]  Horrid.  She is fucking terrible. Who cares? A guy hit a golf ball, hit someone.  Oh, he'd like to see the bruise, this and that. How much do you need to talk about this?  Exactly.  You got hit in the head. Alright.  That's enough.  You got a copy of Caddyshack? Move on. Go back to your gardening.  Go off ball, look off, but we got it.  That wasn't my fucking cannonball.  That would have been great.  Of course it would.  Let's take her head off.  Well, I...  Shut it.  So, that's a terrific story today. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  What a lame friggin' way to present that.  That's how she does it.  It's just...  They gave her much too much time, first of all.  She gets a lot of time on that CNN, yeah.  Human interest type of thing.  With puns and...  Speaking of human interest, what the...  Well, barely human interest.  What happened?  What's with the talent, singer, England, ugly... 
[00:20:30]  The monster?  I was like, I'm playing the $20,000 pyramid.  Susan Boyle?  Ugly, singer, England.  Yeah.  Never got laid.  Susan Boyle.  Yeah, that's a big part of the story.  She hasn't been laid.  But she said she wasn't going to get any kind of makeover or anything.  But what?  She's slowly coming out of the house now with makeup on and her giant retard hair wig.  Whatever that is on her head.  Oh, you don't think that's her real hair? 
[00:21:00]  I can't tell.  It's so big.  It is elephant man-like.  The top of her head is giant.  And if she shaved that head, it's a complete man look.  She has a man face.  But, oh boy, is she milking this 15 minutes.  Well, it's more than that.  I mean, she's the real deal.  What, the singing?  Yeah.  All right.  A lot of these stories, you're right, they milk it. 
[00:21:30]  But in her case, she's the real deal.  You hear about the offer she got?  Of course.  What offer was that?  The indecent proposal?  Yeah, she's never been kissed.  People are starting to say that she looks like Pat from Wynaki.  With the wig.  If you put a wig on Pat.  I think we put a wig.  There's a picture of Pat with hair, I think.  Really?  Oh, we did put a wig on him or something.  I think we put a wig on him.  If we could find that shot, I think we got a good one for her.  Wow, that would really be good if we get.  I think we put a wig on him once.  What about a wig and a dress on him? 
[00:22:00]  Because she hasn't been kissed, there's a porn company out in California.  Of course there is.  California offering her $1 million to make a porno.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Who?  Well, okay, I would say I would watch it.  Everybody would watch it.  Who would watch that?  But it's kind of like, yeah, I would watch it.  $1 million.  It's Pat with a blonde wig on.  Does it look close?  Well, the hair color's different, but yeah, that's pretty close. 
[00:22:30]  We should do a little spoof video with Pat doing his Susan Boyle impression.  What is this song again?  What's the big song she sings?  From Les Miserables.  Oh, I know.  Les Miserables.  That's one of those words, you just start pronouncing it right and then it just falls apart.  Les Miserables.  Les Miserables.  I love the Miserables. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, like my mother used to make a nice big bowl of Miserables.  Here's the latest on Susan Boyle.  I think she's being upstaged a little bit.  They're trying to say she's being upstaged by a 12-year-old.  Yeah.  Here's the story.  Sometimes I go out by myself  And I hook across the water 
[00:23:30]  And I think of all the things  What you doing  And in my head I paint a picture  What?  I hate that fucking show, right?  Is that Britain's Got Talent?  Yeah.  Enough with the fucking  With the ground swell of emotion from the audience.  Yeah.  Assholes.  So what?  They're a needy nation.  Oh my god.  Something other than fucking  Hey, we've colonized this country 
[00:24:00]  Comes out of somebody's mouth.  You ever watch America's Got Talent?  America's Got Talent?  Yeah.  No.  It's a good show.  As far as those shows go  I can't do the Dance with the Stars  I did because of Jeffrey Ross for a couple weeks  And I can't do American Idol anymore  But America's Got Talent is alright  This  Really?  That was a chick  Singing  12 year old  Sounds like Amy Winehouse  Shaheen  Is that a guy or a gal?  A gal  It's a guy  It's a guy  Okay  Listen to his voice  What is that it now?  For him  You got this really wrong 
[00:24:30]  What?  What do you sing apart from that?  Who's Loving You by Michael Jackson  You want to give that a go?  Give it a go, eh?  Give it a go, eh?  Jesus  Jesus  Jesus  Jesus  You're wrong, my dear  You'll sing  Since you went away 
[00:25:00]  Don't you know I'm  Don't you know I'm  With my head hanging  And I'm  And I'm  And I'm  Jesus  Jesus  You're wrong, my dear  You're wrong, my dear  And you're six  Since you went away  Don't you know I'm 
[00:25:30]  I sit around with my head hanging down  And I wonder who's loving you  All my life, all my life  Yeah, you gotta give it to him.  He's 12.  Little bastard is like a little Michael Jackson.  What the fuck were you doing at 12?  Crying, that's something, I'm sure. 
[00:26:00]  What I hate about this show is how the camera just keeps showing the shock look on the judges' faces.  Yeah, yeah, that's their thing.  They can't believe the talent they're witnessing.  Wow!  I love when these contestants can take Simon out of his role of being a douchebag.  Like they keep showing shots of Simon.  Yeah.  Appreciating this kid.  Well, Michael Jackson was, you know, pretty much like that at 12. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, but he was also like a millionaire at 12.  This kid is probably living in the slum somewhere.  Fuck that monster Susan Boyle.  It's all about this 12-year-old.  I think she's done.  This kid's name is Shaheen.  Oh boy.  Jay, jump in when you think you know his name.  Well, not going to work here anymore.  Shaheen, jump in when you can pronounce this. 
[00:27:00]  J-A-F-A-R-  H-A-F-A-R-  G-H-O-L-I  Gorley.  Haffa Gorley.  You're going to go with Haffa Gorley?  I'm not.  Haffa, Haffa, Haffa, Haffa, Haffa Fag.  Haffa Fag.  Sounds like another Italian dish, actually, if you look at the name.  Ah, Haffa Fag.  Haffa Gorley.  I'm going to have some, uh, Jaga Gorley.  My mother would make it.  She put the sauce melt at you.  Really?  Would she?  Ah, the pork would melt in your mouth. 
[00:27:30]  Melt in your mouth.  Here's a question.  How do we get to see this Britain's Got Talent in America?  Can we watch it on the BBC channel or anything like that?  The BBC.  Which is the most boring channel on the cable system.  Oh, it's terrible.  It's awful.  Now news from around the world.  When I will talk like this, I have to go up at the end of everything.  So annoying listening to those guys.  Yeah.  American President Obama visited England. 
[00:28:00]  God.  Is that English?  I want to watch this Britain's Got Talent between the monster and the little kid.  They got a good show going.  God, they got the pictures of all of them.  Well, look at that.  That woman is truly a beast.  How else do you describe her?  Monster.  She's a monster.  I'm with you on that one.  Someone is saying she looks like Otto from Otto and George.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, she does.  Holy shit.  A cock.  He should be working the kid. 
[00:28:30]  Having the kid in her lap.  Oh, shit.  That's good.  Yeah, that's very good.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  That is good.  Look at him.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, I'm going to sing a song, you motherfucker.  Let's say hi to Dale in Michigan.  Dale, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey, Dale.  Looks just like...  Hey, I was going to say they better cut that kid's record pretty quick before he gets 
[00:29:00]  some hair on his nuts and turns into a Peter Brady.  Yeah, that's true.  He's got that nice high voice because he's a kid.  Although, you know, again, Michael Jackson was able to eek that shit out until he was...  They kept giving him female hormones well into his 30s, though.  Is that what they were doing?  Yeah.  I can't get over that now.  Ha, ha, ha.  George.  She looks like George.  Oh, that is great. 
[00:29:30]  So, actually, it's George from Otto and George, right?  Pulp broke cunt, sir.  Pulp broke cunt, sir.  Oh, my God.  That is perfect.  Perfect.  Perfect.  Huck, ha, ha, ha.  Dr. Jimsy from Wackbag.  She looks like a burn victim with fake eyebrows and a wig.  She looks like a Benny Hill character, too.  She's terrible.  Yeah, she's a terrible woman. 
[00:30:00]  That England is weird, man.  There are some really hot bitches in England, but, man, are there some disturbingly inbred  monsters over there.  You get a little island where, you know, not much fucking can go on.  Well, they couldn't get around, so they had to fuck each other.  Yeah, yeah.  That's just it.  Let's start that rumor today.  Maybe that's why they colonized so much, to try to just get that seed off of that little  island.  But once they had to pull back, wow. 
[00:30:30]  So, this Craigless killer, as I look up at one of the ATVs we have in the studio.  Yes.  What a ghoul.  Held without bail.  Good move.  And how delusional is the fiancé?  She says he's a wonderful person inside and out.  They got the wrong guy.  She's saying that the Boston police just arrested him to sell the story and get money for a book. 
[00:31:00]  She's pulling out everything.  This guy's so guilty.  Yeah, they got him on IP addresses.  They got him on...  They found a gun and hand ties, the same ties that were used on the girls, and duct tape  in his apartment.  And they got BlackBerry emails, I guess.  Emails, Craigslist responses.  This guy, like, this guy, like, all the features of the guy that killed that girl.  He's dead in the water.  And apparently, uh, he killed the girl, but, but, he, uh, also, um, like, was, was holding 
[00:31:30]  up some of these girls, getting, uh, getting their cash.  I don't think he was at the killer.  I think he probably was a robbery gun wrong.  He probably went to rob her to see what he fucking hit her with the gun butt or something  and then shot her.  She, apparently she resisted.  What he would do is tie him to the door.  Why are you going into...  To the, the door.  You're going into your book bag like you got some, uh, props for this story.  Yes, it's gonna be hysterical once you see what I do here. 
[00:32:00]  Uh, very funny stuff.  I actually didn't plug something in that I was supposed to plug in, and now it says low battery.  Oh, no.  That's not good.  That's not good.  Uh...  Talk amongst yourselves for a second, or else this will shut off.  Well, they're saying that he was a, uh, a gambler.  He had some debts that he needed to pay off, so he decided to, uh, he decided to rob bitches.  He was on his way to Foxwoods when they arrested him.  Well, after he killed this broad, he went to Foxwoods and he had a good night.  He gambled for, I think, 24 hours and walked away with $5,000. 
[00:32:30]  Wow, not bad.  You want to talk about a poker face?  Yeah, right.  Oof.  Man, if you could kill a broad, go to Foxwoods, and not sweat through poker hands, that's pretty good, right?  Good job, son.  Wow, yeah, he, um, he apparently had done this before.  Mm-hmm.  Getting, uh, robbing money and going to the casinos.  Yep.  And he had a, uh, a little bit of a problem, I think, because he had a lot of, uh, I guess markers taken out. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, really?  He'd get casino credit, and, um, whoopsie.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, he'd lose and have to rob another hooker.  Uh, and that seems to be his M.O., as they like to say, motus operandi.  And he was pre-med?  Yeah, yeah, he had a couple of years in medical school.  Uh, one of these, you know, uh, clean-cut douchebags with the fiancé.  They're supposed to be married in August.  Don't look like that's going to happen. 
[00:33:30]  Might have to put that off.  And, uh, all the friends shocked.  You're going to lose a deposit there.  Yeah, yeah.  Oof.  Oh, that's going to be a little tough.  You're going to have to eat that one.  Who gets the phone call?  Good news, a date has opened up at our wedding hall.  Yeah, yeah.  We have some good news for you.  Don't you think, though, that her family is just consoling her with, look, thank God you found out beforehand.  Mm-hmm.  It could have happened after the wedding. 
[00:34:00]  Just be thankful.  We're going to have to move on with this.  He kills hookers.  This isn't a man we really want at the house for Christmas.  This is not something he can work on.  Yeah.  But then the friends were all saying that they were shocked that this isn't who he is and all that happy horse shit.  But they're also saying there was a weird side to him, kind of a mysterious, he wouldn't, um, he wouldn't talk about himself a lot. 
[00:34:30]  Uh, he didn't, uh, even tell anybody that he was engaged.  Mm-hmm.  They just thought he had a girlfriend.  But, uh, and not a fiancé.  Uh, so, you know, eh, I love when they interview the friends anyway.  Like, what the fuck do they know?  If, if he was going around saying, yeah, I robbed hookers and I killed one, perhaps, you know, it would have ended sooner.  Sure.  Of course they didn't know about it.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, what a, what a piece of shit.  Yeah.  That girl was pretty hot for a Craigslist whore. 
[00:35:00]  And let's be very honest, that is part of the reason we feel as bad as we do.  Because if Susan Boyle was killed.  Oh.  Exactly.  You know.  Yep.  We would be trying to scrape up bail for this fella.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, the poor guy probably was expecting something hot.  Come to the door and this slob comes over.  And the defense attorneys are using the same tactics that hog farmer defense attorneys use.  When they charge it, they're too mean to the pigs and they slaughter them. 
[00:35:30]  You know what amazes me about the lawyers, though, is the, uh, this, this lawyer for this guy, um, after a couple of days, is my client is pleading not guilty and is not guilty.  Yeah, enough of that crap.  You know something?  Shut up.  First of all, how do you know?  How do you know after two days of sitting with this guy, uh, that he's not guilty?  Yeah, I know it's their job to defend them, but, you know, don't come out and publicly make these ridiculous statements in the light of all this evidence. 
[00:36:00]  They go, all they have are words.  All they have are words.  Yeah, words over a BlackBerry.  Words typed into a computer.  IP addresses.  IP addresses.  Satellite coordinates.  Yeah.  They got everything.  Just about everything.  Uh, surveillance tapes.  Yeah, and it's an insult to the victim's family.  I mean, the ground is still soft.  You can't even walk over the grave yet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You sink in as you go visit the thing.  And, uh, yeah, well, he's not guilty, according to the lawyer. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, great.  Thank you.  Go fuck yourself.  Stupid lawyers.  I hate them all.  Hate them all.  But he, uh, yeah, he's been pulling these shenanigans to pay for his gambling debts, and, um, I guess this girl resisted a little too much, conked her on the head, um, and then shot her right in the chest.  Someone, uh, suggested he watched American Psycho a bit too much.  Yeah.  The, the girlfriend's name is very familiar.  Uh-oh.  The last name.  For real?  I might know her mother, yeah, because she lives in, uh, Little Silver, New Jersey. 
[00:37:00]  What?  You might know her mother?  Possibly.  The name is real familiar.  How would you know her mother?  Through another friend of mine.  It could be somebody completely different.  But I used to, I used to hang out at Little Silver years ago when I started comedy, like, 1991.  Um, did you have, uh, relations with the mother?  No, no, no, no.  No.  If, if she's the person I'm thinking of, I just knew her through my friend.  Oh.  Just go research that, Jimmy.  Find out.  Gets, like, the inside scoop.  Maybe we can have her on the show.  Then again, maybe not. 
[00:37:30]  Hey, I, uh, met your mom years ago.  Yeah.  I was doing a high-energy character down the street around us.  High-energy.  Awful bit.  Obese primate, uh, ice cream.  I'm gonna bring that back.  Are you bringing that, uh, chunky monkey bit back?  I thought of that.  That's pretty funny.  We should announce you're gonna do an old-school set.  Why not?  We should do an old-school show, then.  Well, we have been. 
[00:38:00]  Hey, did that make it up?  What, the latest video?  The latest video?  I, uh, if you want to take a look at it.  No, I don't.  Can you, guys, I, uh...  Jimmy, Jimmy just got this big twinkle in his eye.  Well, the bit is, we, I, I've been putting up, uh, old videos from when we did a TV show  called Real Rock TV up in Boston.  And I don't know if it's helping or hurting us.  I'm starting to think maybe I should not put these up.  Why?  It was really funny.  Wait, don't play it yet.  Why not?  It was, uh, very, very funny stuff, guys. 
[00:38:30]  And they're all, these videos are linked to my Twitter, OP Radio.  I can't tweet today.  I don't know where my BlackBerry is.  Tweet.  Oh, I'll tweet.  Tweet.  I don't know where the fuck it is.  Tweet.  I think I might have left it home.  But, uh, here's the second video.  One a day.  One a day until the deuce chills get so bad that I have to stop this process.  One a day is quite enough.  You know, on Twitter, you could hit that reply thing.  Yeah.  Is it positive reviews so far?  Oh, it's just brutal.  Have your fun, boys and girls.  Yeah. 
[00:39:00]  I don't, I didn't even look at it.  And I was getting, like, reviews.  Twittered to me.  Just saying, oh my God.  Oh my God.  Pretty bad stuff, huh?  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  I'll set this clip up.  First of all, the turkey bowling clip was supposed to go up.  Right.  With hot chicks and stuff.  What happened?  I think it could have been okay.  I think we could have saved face on that clip.  But there, um, the video uses, uh, Take the Skinheads Bowling, that old song, that old 
[00:39:30]  dumb song that no one downloads or cares about.  And because of that, there's a copyright infringement thing that YouTube's really into these days.  Well, for a while now.  So, uh, you know, I can't, I can't get it up there.  Sucks.  Hmm.  If they know you're using a piece of music, they, they deny your videos now.  Denied?  Well, they've been doing it for a while.  Which sucks.  Because it was on TV.  We're just re, basically re-broadcasting this. 
[00:40:00]  A load of crap.  And, and that's a much better clip than this.  So, last minute we kind of, like, scrambled and put this one up.  Today's clip should be a lot better, I'm thinking.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  This one's good, though.  So, basically, you know, we're such cool TV hosts, Anthony.  Yeah.  That we're hosting the show from my car.  Just driving around and, and causing all sorts of shenanigans.  Didn't we goof on Rocco about doing this with the rock bus?  Well, we didn't steal my own car, though. 
[00:40:30]  Well, I know, but, but, why were we doing this?  Why were we broadcasting from the car?  I guess it should be noted that, you know, we had a radio show to do.  And then, like.  Here comes the excuses.  And then we had, remember Ian?  Yes, of course.  And then Ian's like, what do you guys want to do on Real Rock TV this week?  We're like, I don't, we don't even know what we want to do on our show.  That's true.  So, it was always like, it really was an afterthought.  Like, all right, how about this?  We'll, we'll film some, some shit from our, you know, my car. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  You can say that again.  So, this starts with Anthony acting retarded.  I'm really surprised Bruce Mittman allowed this on the fine TV show.  Uh-huh.  Because you're acting like a retard.  You're, you're banging your head on the glass, the passenger side window.  Why was I doing that?  Because there's, we're at a red light and there's some, like, you know, housewife next to us.  Oh, I was trying to, like, freak her out.  And you did freak her out.  All right, good.  And we'll start with this. 
[00:41:30]  Jimmy, when you want us to stop the tape, you just raise your hand and point to Danny.  And this is basically just showing you what nuts Opie and Anthony were off the air.  Like.  Crazy.  Like, it doesn't stop here.  No, no, no.  What's DailyMotion.com?  Use DailyMotion.com.  You can put anything up on there.  I might have to do the turkey bowling clip on DailyMotion.com.  I've got to check that out later.  There's so many sites, but, you know, if no one goes there.  Yeah, but if you've got a link and it's stuff that, you know, you weren't able to show anyway, why not? 
[00:42:00]  Throw them, you know, throw these clips around a little bit.  All right, Jimmy, here you go.  The first look at the video.  You didn't see this?  You got to watch.  I did.  Oh, you did see it.  Yes, I did.  I haven't.  I did.  I haven't, so I'm ready to deuce chill out.  Oh, no, this is good.  How many problems you got?  Oh, this is good.  How many problems you got with this clip, Jimmy?  None.  It was really funny.  I mean, I was like, these guys were, like, when did these guys, like, kind of slow down?  It was like, obviously 24 hours of craziness back then.  What an asshole. 
[00:42:30]  All right, here we go.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Good copy.  Look at that.  racing away  fun with opie and anthony  this is what we do when we're not on the radio 
[00:43:00]  pause it  fun with opie and anthony this is what we do  when we're not on the radio  fun with opie and anthony  I was groaning  and banging my head against the window to try  to upset the woman that was  next to us at a light  yep that's fun  I don't even remember doing this  I don't remember doing this at all  at all  what do you think Jimmy  that's the same thing Markoff is saying this morning in Boston 
[00:43:30]  no recollection of doing this  I don't remember this  there was  it's not particularly well shot  it's in the back seat like a guy is just  holding the video camera  and you can tell there was no take two  no no there's not one  for safety as they say  let's do one more for safety  we don't have time for take twos  alright here comes the second part of the video  yeah  radio by the way  real rock tv on the road 
[00:44:00]  that's great  it's out for the poll  stop it don't be an idiot  honestly  hey on the real rock tv show tonight  we got a live performance from  power man 5000  that's rob zombie's  brother on these vocals  hey you want to see us break a law  for real rock tv  get the red light on the  on the tv  watch  oh my god  there's a red light now  we got down set  we got down set  from the middle east  you're crazy  what  the camera cut right there is horrendous  probably because we stopped short 
[00:44:30]  yeah  and didn't go through it  and made sure we didn't break the law  why would  why would the camera stop there  and not show us going through the light  it shows you going up under the red light  and then all of a sudden  uh  I do remember we actually  went through the red light  yeah  we did  but  I'm so amazed and stunned  whoa  but  this is  you know  we've been dealing with  management and lawyers  for a long time  I  I do believe  they didn't want us  didn't want to show us  breaking some law 
[00:45:00]  oh that's probably  on a tv show  so they cut it out  so then we would get  arrested  or  or we'd have some kind of problem  it's like  whatever  we'll deal with  going through a red light  I'll take the points  I think you're right  if it makes for good tv  but they're like  no no no  makes for good tv  let's cut  to be arrested for this  let's cut it right before  you officially break the law  that's probably what the station  was just telling you guys  to be polite  they were probably like  this is horrible  yeah  just tell them it's illegal  maybe they'll drop the bitch  but it's funny 
[00:45:30]  like that was the big law  it was like the little  slow drive through the red light  oh yeah  did it  alright here we go  hit it again  we got a star wars party  and uh  Rocco I think is doing something  with the monster truck show man  yeah  alright  is that a cop  man  yeah I want to comment  about my man  a star wars party  what's a star wars party  I don't remember  I don't remember  a star wars party  maybe it was the morning show  it had to be  those  we were like cross promoting

[00:47:00]  is the only way to put that  I can't even  does that make you  uncomfortable to watch  yeah  yeah  I'm kind of  I'm cringy  I'm trying to  wrap my arms up  a little bit  around myself  to get warm  people are confused  I said I don't remember  this at all  and then I remember  the red light thing  but all of a sudden  the red light thing  came into  I remember that  they didn't want us  to officially  get in trouble  they wanted us  to be edgy  but not officially  break the law 
[00:47:30]  on the TV show  just a crap  we've been dealing  with forever  yes Jimmy  it's actually going  like you know  like oh no the cops  like you're like  making it like  it's a crazy ending  and what's gonna happen  right  because I didn't know  we're screwed  oh we're screwed  the beauty is  that Anthony  Anthony gets pulled over  every other month now  so  of course  see  see we're edgy  see  see  I don't film it  that's when my voice  gets hard  see  oh god  so what happened  did the cops pull you over  oh yeah

[00:54:30]  we're unlike  just about every  other show  yeah  we allow this  we allow these  beatings  we throw ourselves  under the bus  and then I read  comments  and they're like  I'm like  you don't get it  I have to say  this today  dude that was so lame  I was like  yes  I know  exactly  I know my hair  is horrendous  I know I look  like a Dutch boy  thing  no  well you ought to  defend it vehemently 
[00:55:00]  it's great stuff  it's very funny  just try to fight  our way out of it  yeah  Steven asked  from Bayshore  how to find line  today  oh  about this  he writes  O&A  from happy to be there  to angry at everything  good for you  that is true  wow  oh there's a typo  on the pad data  according to Scott  from Hoppock  it's supposed to read  real suck TV  thank you 
[00:55:30]  bless you  bless you  and someone  suggesting  this is  everything  kids did  in high school  it's not TV  worthy  yeah  we were cutting  edge  like jackass  before jackass  and  and  no  well yeah  the cheese thing  was pretty  that was like  jackass  yeah  see  well before  jackass  we were the  originators of  jackass  yeah  douchebags  we just didn't have  the good bits  yeah  we didn't 
[00:56:00]  do anything  funny or  entertaining  on there  so it was  we asked for  a piece of cheese  yeah  were we introing  like  you know  segments  yeah  between  hey you asked  for the cheese  pal  I just tried  to get half  of it  and you did  get half  yes  see  the thing  about  VHS tape  is that  over time  it degenerates  yes  yes  now  with this  technology  we'll be able  to have  every episode  of Real Rock TV  forever and ever  it will reside 
[00:56:30]  in the  digital world  as long as  there is a  digital world  somewhere  it will be there  yeah  have you found  a douchey  Rocco bit  that really brings  the whole Rocco  thing home  you know  his is probably  going to look  like fucking  gold  compared to  our horse shit  people are going  to be like  yeah that Rocco  was funny  I'm going to  find the best  Rocco band  find like  something really  funny  will look  like shit  and he'll  look like  a genius  I can't  get over  the fact  that he  looks like  a fat  Kenny Powers  he's got  the mullet  and everything  working 
[00:57:00]  my mullet  dude  alright  the next  one goes  up  today  we go  early  because it's  part two  of the  driving  thing  so  probably  before noon  today  wonderful  I know why  I'm doing  that  can't wait  so they forget  about the other  one we put  up  yeah  well  they'll forget  by watching  something worse  it's horrible  alright  great  and you don't  know other bits  that come to mind  yet that you're  thinking  not off the top  of the head  but I mean I have  top of your head 
[00:57:30]  is a mess too  yeah  did you see  you're ripping me  off because  did you see  from under my  hat  all that  afro hair  poking out of  the back of  the hat  yeah  yeah  yeah  those were the  days  those were the  days  alright  what's sad  I'm actually  paying Sam  to do this  for me  wow  why am I  paying you  to make sure  these are on  DVD  because we  need them  archiving  I guess  right  yeah  he's archiving  some of my  stuff  that's fantastic  I'm gonna give 
[00:58:00]  these tapes  to the Museum  of Television  Radio  and Film  oh are you  yes  in the  what not to do  section  the new  what not to do  wing  yeah so it's  OP Radio on  YouTube and  OP Radio on  Twitter with the  links  you do  oh Jimmy  you started  taking that  again  yeah  you did  one already  before I left  the house  oh wow  one dump  already  and you have  to go again  yeah  this is really  cleaning you  out  this is liquid  though  but some  people say  it's all 
[00:58:30]  bullshit  it might be  I don't know  though  some swear  by it  and others  say no  it's all  bullshit  these pills  that clean  you out  what does  Dr. Steve  say  he's a good  one to go to  Dr. Steve  can we get him  on the phone  paging Dr. Steve  we'll try to get  Dr. Steve  on the phone  about the  oxypowder  oxypowder  it's all this  stuff that  really  gets you  doing some  exploding  crap  it's like  Metamucil  or  Metamucil  I like the 
[00:59:00]  Metamucil  I like the  Metamucil  I like the  Metamucil  because it  just keeps  things  going  I like that  Selim Haas  does the  same thing  but it  tastes  terrible  quick break  and hopefully  Dr. Steve  to talk about  duty  and Miss  California  I don't want  to let this  stupid Perez  Hilton story  go yet  this guy  is infuriating  me by making  it all about  himself  that's what  he did  that's what  he did  but they 
[00:59:30]  allowed it  I'm more  pissed off  I think  at Trump  for allowing  this  well he  doesn't care  he just  wants to  see  it's  Trump's  pageant  or not  really  I know  NBC  it is  he just  wants to  get as many  viewers as  possible  so that's  what he  does  and Miss  California  is now  defending  herself  on the  Today Show  we got  that audio  she's basically  saying she  didn't realize  how many gay  people there  were out  there  now she's  kind of  backtracking  a little bit  but it's  like you  answered the  question  honestly  yeah  she did  a fine  job  I think  the gay  community 
[01:00:00]  would even  admit that  like you  know  all right  maybe we  don't agree  with what  she said  but she  answered the  question  honestly  and that's  all it was  about  I don't think  the gay  community  would agree  what  to tell you  the truth  what do you  think they're  on Perez  Hilton's side  yeah  that's too bad  the gays are  very  no I'm not  saying about  they know how  to get behind  each other  you don't think  they have an  open mind  enough to  mind  I'll just  do gay  jokes  now  for the  whole  but you  don't think  they have  an open  mind  to realize 
[01:00:30]  that she  answered the  question  honestly  even though  maybe they  don't like  the answer  she gave  that seems  to be the  problem  no  what the  fuck  is wrong  with everybody  gays are  at least the  ones you see  in the press  in the media  defending  gayness  are very  surprisingly  enough  intolerant  very intolerant  as to other  people's opinions  on gay  it's weird  you'd think  they would  understand  what intolerance  is  and maybe  learn from it 
[01:01:00]  but they  don't like  other people  having ideas  every group  is intolerant  that is true  it's like  every group  and that's  the biggest  problem  with our  society  every group  fighting for  tolerance  is very  intolerant  well we  had the  Rick Ross  interview  that Sam  did  and he's  calling  50 Cent  a monkey  and stuff  and I'm  thinking  a white  dude does  that  he's so  fired  and shot  yeah  true  that would  be a major  problem  yup  but then I  get confused  I'm like  well if he's 
[01:01:30]  saying monkey  then why can't  whitey say monkey  why can't we all  say the same  shit is what I'm  saying  I don't know  was he using it  as a slurry  you think  or just like  as a  no  but  he was ugly  yeah  but that's  what I'm  saying  if you said  that  yeah let's  just use  it in that  term  if you said  it to  describe  someone's  ugliness  yeah  like they did  in what  Sanford and  Son was the  big line  oh yeah  gorilla cookies  right  if Aunt Esther  ought to  slam her face  into dough  and make  gorilla cookies  that's what  Red Fox said 
[01:02:00]  which is  hysterical  it's a brilliant  line  but if a white  comedian does  that  fired  fired back  then  fired today  yeah  I think we  should all  just be able  to say the  same shit  well that's  the age old  problem  isn't it  we're not  allowed to  so we sit  here and  walk on  eggshells  it's amazing  it's so  ridiculous  we can only  do whitey  jokes  yeah  stupid  whitey  white people  are stupid  you want to  film some  car bits 
[01:02:30]  today  yeah let's  get the  camera  Sam  get in the  back seat  and film us  cool  cool  we should  I should  take a ride  out to your  joint  Sam's in the  back and let's  see what we  can come up  with  but that's  what we did  you know  ten years ago  yeah it  certainly is  didn't have  a filter  to think  well maybe  this doesn't  belong on  TV  it stunk  stop uploading  old real rock  TV clips  and just 
[01:03:00]  reenact them  for the new  generation  update them  yeah  reimagining  reimagining  reimagining  but the same  but the same  stuff though  I want you  to be going  yeah  yeah  and I'll  get some  I want to  get a  Dutch  boy  like  wig  and gets  the ponytail  wig  and with  like  with like  sweeping  cameras  and  and  and  CGI  like it's  got to be  done really  well now  it's got to  visually look  good  even though  it's the  same horse 
[01:03:30]  shit  yeah  you gotta do  a show  live from the  compound  where you  like kind of  like show  these videos  on your  green screen  and comment  about them  oh I know  yeah  yeah  we've already  come up with  the Danny  came up  was that you  came up  with the idea  the mystery  science theater  oh yeah  yeah  for these  videos  we got  well  or just  other stuff  for like  anything  every so often  you can't  come up  with that  idea  that is  that's  wait a minute  I can't  allow that  but  but see  it's  us stealing 
[01:04:00]  it  but it's  us stealing  the idea  and doing  it  in a real  theater  live  live  that's  live  playing a  movie  and then  we'll just  goof on  the movie  if you guys  want to make  yourselves feel  better  when we come  back from  break  I have a  scorch update  we're all  going to be  back together  after the break  all right  Mark Murphy  from Boston  you guys  are like  the moron  uncle  from Napoleon  Dynamite  who has  the bad  videos  of himself  throwing 
[01:04:30]  a football  he was  great  another movie  that just  gets better  and better  the more  you watch  that guy  was a  true tool  he was  a  let's not  forget  guy  butt  fucked  by wife  that story  on the way  you're  checking out  the Opie  and Anthony  show live  from Sirius  XM  way up in  the sky  we're way  up there  right  how many  floors  36  36 floors 
[01:05:00]  up  yeah that  elevator ride  pops your  ears every  morning  yeah  you gotta  yawn  halfway up  right  yeah you gotta  give that  or swallow  hard  especially if you're  on your knees  and Jimmy's in the  elevator  big load  whoever designed  this place  not this studio  just the whole  facility  I don't know  I mean the views  you get up here  are ridiculous  we don't see them  we don't see them  we're in the bowels  it would give you a  nice feeling of  broadcasting live  from you know 
[01:05:30]  the biggest city  in the world  skyscraper  instead we look  at walls  and  I kinda like  not seeing  I'm telling you  I never liked  that sun  bouncing off  the buildings  every morning  never liked it  I don't like  K-Rock  I never liked  how the light  would come in  it would always  be in my face  I like a  fucking studio  where you can  you don't know  we could be here  at one o'clock  in the morning  it wouldn't make  a difference  I don't like  to see any  of the outside  world  and the weather  you know something  he might have a point  because the weather  sometimes made an impact  like if it was 
[01:06:00]  a nice sunny day  it'd feel kind of  good and everything  and then it's  crappy snow  or cold  and you'd look  out the window  and just be like  fuck I gotta go  out in that  I don't want  to see the passage  of time outside  I don't want  to see anything  I want everything  the light to remain  the same  yeah it's weird  time still passes  even in here Jimmy  I thought this was  magic land  I'm the complete opposite  I want to see  the day  really  developing  you know what it is  you would think  that there would be  studios 
[01:06:30]  like it doesn't  have to be  only the executives  and the conference  rooms that get  the fucking windows  overlooking the city  you know you'd think  maybe a studio or two  could have a window  that looks out  over Manhattan  there's even like  a hallway that  separates the studios  from the windows  from the windows  so there are studios  close to the windows  but then there's  a hallway that  separates them  I would have  shoved that shit  right up against  the windows  probably some engineer  going wow  the acoustics  there's a problem  with the acoustics  bouncing off  the windows  you walk that 
[01:07:00]  hallway  it's actually  on break  sometimes I'll go  and walk behind  our studio  and let's just  look out the window  it's great  yeah  pretty high up  it's way  way up  almost 400 feet  you get to see  Times Square  the Hudson River  it's  yeah they're going  to Broadway  you see Broadway  what were you saying  Danny  you're the only one  that like  is annoyed  at the view  that he has  out the office window  I'm probably  the youngest person  I'm the youngest person  would be annoyed  at their Times Square  office view  because in the morning  it's very dark  and we keep the lights  down in the office  and Times Square 
[01:07:30]  is just blaring  in your face  you're trying to work  you're trying to work  and like every two seconds  like you just kind of  you just want to  me I want to look  to the left  because something  is flashing  out of the corner  of my eye  for the people  that have never  been to New York City  and checked out  Times Square  in the middle of the night  it's daylight  yeah yeah  you can walk  down Broadway  you walk down Broadway  and you ever been  inside a club  like when you come  out of Caroline's  comedy club  and it's  midnight  two in the morning  whatever it is  you close the joint  you walk out 
[01:08:00]  when you're walking  up the stairs  you can't see  the sky  but you can see  the street  and the buildings  across the street  and stuff  and it's like  kind of like  an overcast day  outside  and you actually  feel like you're  walking into daylight  and then you realize  holy shit  it's two in the morning  and you look up  and the sky  is dark  and it's time  to go to the bar  around the corner  and then you walk  a little too far  and then you start  going into zombie  territory  yes  very treacherous  out there at times 
[01:08:30]  hey we got a  Scorch update  Scorch  now for the newbies  Scorch  Scorch worked with us  at AAF  in the Boston area  unfortunately  Scorch was let go  before  any real rock  TV episodes  before the success  of  the success  of the station  before the giant  success  of real rock  TV  so he wasn't  involved in those  comedic hijinks  that you're getting  to enjoy 
[01:09:00]  and he's the famous  jock that was  we always forget  but he was either  pizza  or  hamburger  and Dave Douglas  wanted the opposite  so he said  look Scorch  you're pizza  let's say  and I need  hamburger  so you're out  you're not bad  he's like  you're not bad  I'm going to have  to fire you  if I want a pizza  you'd be  people love pizza  but I need  a hamburger  so Scorch  left  that could be  I had to leave 
[01:09:30]  that could be a good  little phone bit  that we could kind of  say in and out today  how the boss  fired you  with their dumb  analogies  instead of just going  you know what  idiot  you're fired  it's always  we never got an  analogy  you're an asshole  we need talent  and you're shit  but the best one  I ever heard  was Scorch's  firing  your pizza  I want hamburger  I'm sorry  pizza's good  you should find  someone that likes pizza  pizza's good  don't let this be  a reflection on you  and what you do  you're great  people love pizza  but I'm 
[01:10:00]  I need a hamburger  I'm in the mood  for a hamburger  so take your  fucking sauce  cheese and dough  and roll out  the fucking door  and now Scorch  is pretty much  delivering pizza  so  worked out well  for him  oh no  what is he doing  Sam  the beauty of  Sam  is  his butt  his butt  thank you  yes  cherub  little cherub  Sam worked with  Scorch as well  yes 
[01:10:30]  which is very bizarre  yes  he worked with  someone from our past  Scorch taught me  everything I know  about radio  he tells everybody  that right  yeah  doesn't he tell people  that we ripped off  half his bits  he says he thought  him up and just  gave him to us  yeah  I thought  what are some of  the bits we took  from Scorch  according to Scorch  he's not upset  about it  like you guys  share back and  forth a little bit  a little back and  forth going on  with us and Scorch  like brainstorming  for instance  he gave you guys  douche or dressing  that you guys love  right  he gave that to you  guys  we did it once 
[01:11:00]  as a mockery  that was Scorch  of Scorch  it was an homage  no it was a mockery  okay it was  he also I mean  one of your guys  favorite things  was always  feels for meals  which was a Scorch  creation  no it wasn't  I remember the day  we came up with that  what are you talking  of Scorch that day  no I wasn't  that was definitely  a Scorch idea  and you know  and then he said  that he borrowed  from you  finding out  what the caller's  name was  before going on air 
[01:11:30]  that way when he  goes on air  he could say  hey Jim  what do you have  for the show  that was an  O&A thing  was it  saying who the  caller is  wow  wait we invented  that who who  we invented  actually saying  hi Mike  yes  for the show  but you were  sharing with  Alexander Graham Bell  because the phone  doesn't  but he doesn't  have  I think radio guys  there's a lot of  radio people that  just go  hi Sirius  in our case 
[01:12:00]  right  or hi XM  but I  I think  I heard  jocks  like just  go hey  Mike  what do you  got  unfortunately  he doesn't  have the  phone screening  technology  that you  guys have  so during  commercial break  he answers  one of the  three phone lines  and without  doing  kind of tones  down the  Scorch voice  and asks  their name  then writes  down on a  piece of  paper  and then when  they get  back on the  air  that way  actually  no he does  it all  during songs  because he  records the  calls  he puts  them on  hold 
[01:12:30]  and then  he waits  and then  he picks  them back  up so he  can record  saying  most radio  guys are  not allowed  to go  to the  phones  live  it's a  no no  before we  get the  Scorch update  we got a  couple analogies  for being  fired  listen to  this guy  speaking of  mics  it's Mike  in Albany  Mike  hey  good morning  boys  good morning  Mike  hey  I had a  boss  tell me  once  the company  was on  a train  to a  new  direction  and they  didn't  buy me  a chicken  that's a  good one  yeah  oof  what an 
[01:13:00]  asshole  really  alright  thank you  thanks boys  insensitive  looks like  Mousy in  Alabama  Alabama  mom  Mousy  hey  hey  what's up  boys  hey mom  yeah  I was let  go  once  and apparently  I was told  yeah well  you know  when you guys  marry  sometimes the  marriage works  and that's  the kind  of girl  you want  but you  know  we need  a different  kind of  change  of you  know  women  you're  a lousy  lay  so leave  what's up  boys  I think  this next 
[01:13:30]  call leads  to the  Scorch update  Sam  it's Ken  in New  Hampshire  Ken  listen to this  you think  Real Rock  TV's bad  I'm gonna  steal Sam's  little idea  and update  for ya  alright  in Manchester  New Hampshire  Scorch actually  does a TV  show like  you guys  used to do  called  Pretty  Fucking  Good  TV  watch it  and he  broadcasts  from a  Chinese  restaurant  in town  isn't it  P  it's  PFG  PFG  TV  starring  Scorch  I guess  obviously 
[01:14:00]  this caller  is one  of the  PFG  disciples  PFG  disciples  here we got  some PFG  disciples  what happened  to the kingdom  of nakedness  I don't know  he's always  moving  he went to  Manchin  well  when he went  to Syracuse  it became  totally new  no the  naked militia  naked militia  naked militia  he said  he was doing  naked militia  and then you  guys started  doing ONA  army  but it's  cool  don't worry  about it  I was reading 
[01:14:30]  the PFG  TV thing  please say  that again  in case you  were worried  or whatever  he started  doing naked  militia  and then you  started doing  ONA army  but it's  cool  as long as  he's not  mad  Jesus Christ  don't worry  about it  is there  are there  any clips  of Scorch  on that  site  Danny  because  oh my  goodness  well the  thing is  what brought  it to my  attention  he's been  doing this  for a little  while  on public 
[01:15:00]  access  at least  ours was  on regular  TV  it was  I mean  a Spanish  speaking  channel  and I was  looking on  his Twitter  and he  posted an  article  that was  published  about him  talking about  the great  success  of PFG  TV  and I was  going through  it  and some  of it  highlighted some  of the good  parts  yes  some of it  didn't  necessarily  ring true  or was 
[01:15:30]  things that  I could  hear Scorch  saying  for instance  you remember  when you used  to call this  program and  say he was  getting signed  to XM  in a matter  of months  but he  couldn't talk  about it  right  well in this  article  it says  after a year  of doing  PFG TV  on public  access  we're the  first locally  produced late  night talk show  in the area  Scorch said  it's very  humbling  but it's  very exciting  at the same  time  then he told  the reporter 
[01:16:00]  now Scorch  said he's  on the verge  of signing  with a network  he is reluctant  to discuss it  in detail  at this time  however  of course  he is  god damn  Scorch  so I'm thinking  it could be  NBC  it could be  network  yeah  you're talking  the big ones  the Nashua  Telegraph  actually bought  into his  crap  you don't  think he's  almost  signing  with a  network  I first  met Scorch  in the month  of August  at which  time he  said he  would probably  be going to  XM in the  fall  but that I 
[01:16:30]  could come  with him  oh wow  that's nice  how many years  ago was that  this was  2000  and this  was 2005  and then  as  hold on  Sam  the phones  are just  lit  oh no  everyone  knows a  little  something  about  Scorch  John  in  Manchester  hey  how you  doing  guys  hey  another  PFG  siple  yes  I  wouldn't  call it  that  but  anyways  I  want to  correct  that  last  douchebag  PFG  TV 
[01:17:00]  has been  down  because  the  restaurant  that he  was  broadcasting  from  had a  fire  a while  ago  and he's  out of  business  can't he  find another  Chinese  restaurant  it's  covered in  the article  actually  oh  it is  Sam  yes  the restaurant  that he was in  did in fact  burn to the  ground  but he is  now broadcasting  the show  in the  very  technologically  advanced  public access  studio  do you think  that he's  humbled  and excited  at the same  time  I think  it's kind 
[01:17:30]  of  yeah  it's a  mixed emotion  because he's  humbled  like he has  to take a step  back to look  at all the  success  but at the  same time  he wants  to move  forward  with this  thing  I beg  you  I gotta  read some  of this  stuff  sure  alright  the show  is inspired  of course  the show  what is it  again  PFGTV  PFGTV  starring  Scorch  the show  is inspired  by David  Letterman's  long time  network show  but rather  than featuring  A-list  stars  Scorch  looks more  locally  for his  guests  it's a  choice  local  cops  philanthropists 
[01:18:00]  artists  chefs  and even  a dog  psychiatrist  have spent  time  on the  big  blue  couch  alongside  Carpinelli  yeah  that's  Nick  Carpinelli  who's that  it's a  sidekick  it's like  the  Andy  Richter  chatting  it up  with  Scorch  and then  Anthony  yeah  Scorch  has also  spent  oh wait  okay  we're pretty  good  where we  are right  now  Scorch  said  but his  ultimate  goal  is  and it's  good  to have  a goal  yes  it is  is to  infest  the  living  rooms  of  America  as a  network  regular  with  no holds 
[01:18:30]  barred  brand  of  humor  I'm  certainly  not  against  I've done  I've done  a total  of three  shows  from my  basement  and more  people have  seen it  than all  of Scorch's  what is it  PFG  Cyples  oh PFG  TV  oh yeah  yeah  oh PFG  TV  I thought  you meant  the people  who watch  PFG  TV  oh yeah  by the way  update on  his twitter  how many  followers  he's actually 
[01:19:00]  at  39  followers  what  oh 39  followers  I was waiting  for a hundred  after that  yeah yeah  a thousand  something  wow  but I mean  that's something  twitter's on the  way out  anyway  you missed  towards the  end by the  way  the show  is taped  at 8pm  Mondays  and Scorch  said anyone  looking to be  part of the  audience is  welcome  the audience  can also get  some FaceTime  on TV  as well  since Scorch  ends every  program similar  to Saturday  Night Live 
[01:19:30]  with the audience  joining in the  farewell wave  from the set  so you could  be on TV  but I'm  looking at  this and  the production  value is  zero  it's much  different than  SNL  it's Scorch  holding a  camera  technically  this is  one of the  PFG TV  podcasts that  he posts  every day  that we've  listened to  before  PFG TV  the TV  show  is a totally  different animal  can I see  some of the  I want to see  production value 
[01:20:00]  here  see Danny's  got the intro  right now  alright  there's a  plane  obviously filmed  just for the  show  yeah there's a  plane landing  in an airport  looks like  Miami or  something  no that's  New Hampshire  what Palm  trees  Manchester  looks like  Miami or  Vegas  what is he  doing  yeah that's  Vegas  oh Vegas  no I think  that's  Manchester  the Mirage  there's no  Mirage in  New Hampshire  why does this  intro show 
[01:20:30]  Vegas  it's  Manchester  no it's  not him  staying at  that hotel  it's  Planet  Hollywood  in  Vegas  and now  and now  it's  rainy  now  I think  there was  a cut  to make  it look  like  oh  Yi  Dynasty  that's  the  Chinese  alright  here's  tens of  fans  here's  the  PFG  Cypress  the live  audience  smart to  keep it  tight  yeah  look 
[01:21:00]  there's  no one  behind  there's  empty  pool  tables  in this  bar  if you'll  notice  the audience  shot  transitioned  to a  shot  of the  same  audience  members  yeah  now he's  live in the  restaurant  oh that was  good  it's  empty  there is  no one  there  I think  there's  20  people  12  people  this is 
[01:21:30]  an early  show  before the  restaurant  burned to  the ground  dude there  are 12  people  there  did you  hear what's  coming up  on the  show  wheel of  meat  wheel of  meat  the transitions  are akin to  a 1986  wedding video

[01:24:00]  I want to  talk about  a couple  of things  anybody  hear about  the  SWAT  team  that went  through  Manchester  his monologue  did you hear  about that  it happened  outside my  house  it happened  outside my  house  I'm freaking  out  hold on  hold on  hold on  obviously  like many  talk shows  you gotta  start  you introduce  who's gonna  be on  and things  like  hey you do  your monologue  and he's doing  his monologue  and it's very  local  he keeps it 
[01:24:30]  local  for the local  people at the  bar  and he probably  had like an  idea there  about the  SWAT team  did you hear  about it  and someone  ruined his  whole  bit  it ruined  the whole  joke  it was  outside my  house  no no  it was  outside my  house  because that's  my joke  the guy  ruined his  whole  fucking joke  because it  really happened  outside of his  house  and it didn't  happen outside  Scorch's house  one of the  12 people  at the taping  ruined it for  Scorch  god damn  12 people  here and  one has  gotta be  had it  happened  here  that was 
[01:25:00]  his set up  it happened  outside my  house  he stepped  on his  set  the guy's  not talking  to the guy  at the bar  Scorch is  doing a  monologue  Danny back  that up  please  oh wow  slightly  okay here  we go  the crowd  must be  miked  by the way  this is a  10 minute  video so  settle in  boys and girls  settle in  yeah just when  you thought  we were gonna  go so we  won't go  through it  all  settle in  settle in  because this  is like  just like  David Letterman  without the  David and 
[01:25:30]  the Letterman  part  he's gold  but plus  tarps  right  it happened  outside my  house  it happened  outside my  house  I'm freaking  out  I go bring  my dogs  out for a  walk  all of a  sudden I  see these  guys dressed  I thought  it was  Columbine  I see  these guys  dressed up  in full  like a  camouflage  while you  can see  their eyes  and I hear  them say  we're gonna  set up  right here  the first  thing that  came to  my mind  was Columbine  shit  my house  is in  trouble  I'm probably  gonna get  killed  right here  second  thing  that came  to mind  Danny 
[01:26:00]  it's very  funny  yeah  because  it's very  funny  he keeps  referencing  Columbine  but there's  not a  school nearby  it's a  house  and it's  a SWAT  guy  dressed  differently  Columbine  had like  black trench  coats  these guys  are in  camouflage  they probably  have SWAT  written on  I'm sure  there was  a van  somewhere  the SWAT  guys parked  three blocks  away  it couldn't  be further  from Columbine  the ice cream  man came  I heard  the bells  I was thinking  Columbine  how is it 
[01:26:30]  Columbine  there's not  no school  it's the  authorities  they dress  differently  you remember  how funny  Columbine was  when it first  happened  oh  scream  laugh  riot  let's see  how he  brings it  all together  back it up  slightly  Columbine  this is twice  terrible delivery  mine was Columbine  shit my house  is in trouble  I'm probably  gonna get  killed right  here  second thing  that came  to mind  is uh oh  maybe it's  the DEA  so as of  about 8.30  this afternoon  or 8.30  like an hour  ago  I was actually 
[01:27:00]  still pulling  balloons full of  crap out of  like my backyard  because my  stash was gone  because I ain't  gonna get  in trouble  with that  I think people  are doing  a good  stash  and push  I  laugh  laugh  laugh  laugh  laugh  laugh  laugh  laugh  laugh  laugh  laugh  wow  laugh  laugh  laugh  happening  since 8.30  this afternoon  this afternoon  a few minutes  ago  just ended

[01:28:00]  they were  supposed to  leave in the  middle of the  night and  Paulie called  him at like  4 o'clock in  the morning  like dude so  we're going  today right  like right  now so we  can make it  for the show  and Scorch  goes no  no can't  go sick  can't go  sick  he was sick  and then  Paulie walked  in on him  like maybe  later that  afternoon  smoking pot  with all  his friends  Paulie  he's just  scared to  come on  this show  mustache  mustache  is down  there  and you  know  all my  shit's in 
[01:28:30]  there  but seriously  folks  when we play  it again  I want to  hear 830  this afternoon  again  you like  the 830  this afternoon  off by  six hours  here we  go  I was  actually  still pulling  balloons  full of  crap  out of  my  backyard  because  my  stash  was  gone  because  I  ain't  going to  get in  trouble  with that  how many  people enjoy 
[01:29:00]  a good  stash  anybody enjoy  a good  stash  how many  people  what else  was going  on  man  I mean  like  I was  talking  me and  Nick  were talking  about this  about the  whole  Elvis  thing  why  whatever  happened  like  why  is  so  cool  about  Elvis  you know  why is  there  no  why does  Charles  Nelson  Riley  ever get  seen  at a  7-eleven  you know  what I mean  I'll take  I'll take  a burrito  in a  honcho  magazine  why is  it always  Elvis  I'm not  no fan

[01:30:30]  around this  guy's arm  and PFG  is kind of  in the middle  surrounded by  ink so  what he could  have done  hypothetically  is gotten  the tattoo  and then  for the show  and then he  could just  have the PF  and G  filled in  and it  looks like  a regular  tattoo  that is  kind of  true  but  you think  this guy  actually got  a PFG  tattoo  yeah  I've been  looking at  artists  because I  think my  next tattoo  is going to  be PFG  oh it is  I'm going to  get a tramp  stamp  a tramp  stamp  let's hit the

[01:40:30]  the others  oh  and he'll  first announce  the three  separately  then put them  back in the  briefcase  and then announce  which are the  most popular  that's the  munchbox  that's a waste  of time if you  even think it  it's like  jaywalking  kind of  except  oh  all right  let's go  back  please more  pfg  oh yes  see the  first hand  reaction of  the people  i love to 
[01:41:00]  be able to  be me  i like to  get paid  to be me  however little  or a mile  you know  a lot we  get paid  i enjoy a  paycheck  to be me  i like  making a  living out  of having  fun  you know  i mean  there's  how many  people in  there have  fun at  their jobs  yeah you  know  but they're  clapping  we have a  lot of  great time  so  it's supposed  to be if you  say how many  people have  fun  but plus we  go no none  of us  yeah no no  you're the  lucky one

[01:50:00]  this is what  i do  and i enjoy  doing it  and i do  it because  it's like  being in a  theater all  the time  and you  never know  i do it  and that's  why i do it  i do it  because  everybody  he's saying  nothing  he's saying  nothing  we are going  to come  right back  now that you  know everything  there is to  know about  all of the  pfg crew  we're going  to come back  and for the  first time  ever  live from  pfg tv  television center

[01:51:30]  to i please  can we hear the  guy the last  guy because i  yelled through him  i know i know  it's he looks  like stephen king  that's a great  guy is great  feathery grayish  hair with stephen  king glasses  yeah but it's  just not nothing  of substance  comes out of  his mouth  nothing  sounds to me  like someone is  a pfg  siple  i'll let her  rip  jeff lawrence  who me and 
[01:52:00]  jeff met  now nick had a  barbecue in his  house and he's  like you're  jeff lawrence  i've heard of  you you might  think it was  at nick's  company  i'm like you  might have been  at radio maybe  that much longer  than me  with mesh t-shirts  sure it was  tell us you  remember that  yeah so  jeff tell us  why you love  doing what  you love to  do  basically because  i hate manual  labor but  good for you  yeah  it's just  something i've  done for like  40 years now  and it's just  you know when i  when i went  to divorce  get divorced  i told the  judge basically  i'm a maverick  and an oddball  and unemployable 
[01:52:30]  doing anything  else so  this is what i  do and i enjoy  doing it and i  do it because  it's it's like  uh being a kid  all the time  and you never  get old doing  this and that's  why i do it  i do it because  everybody seems  to have a good  time when you  have these kind  of things going  on so i hope  you enjoy  yourself  bfg disciples  i never thought  you could get  like that many  people in a  row give you  uh douche chills  like that like  one was worse 
[01:53:00]  than the next  i've never heard  four people  collectively say  not one thing  of interest  that man's been  a radio broadcaster  for he said  40 years  40 years  wait a minute  yeah how  how old is  he he's probably  i'll say 60  he would have  to be like  at least 58  yeah  when we get  back the wheel  of meat  more pfg tv  starring our  old pal  scorch  yeah  sending this out  to scorch 
[01:53:30]  this morning  you  you  you  Danny's doing  the dance  he's clapping  his hands over  his head  and his gut  was hanging  his fucking  t-shirts  tucked in  i do that  around my  house  it's just so  much fun  it's fantastic  well were we  yeah we were  gonna move on  but this pfg tv  we gotta do  one more segment  our old pal  scorch we  worked with  him at  aaf  in the 
[01:54:00]  boston area  easily 10  11 years  ago  pfg tv  cigars and  scotch  calling it  pointless  fucking  garbage tv  that's not  what it stands  for  no i know  sam  we're gonna  move on  but he  teased the  wheel of  meat so  we have  to  he's also  the guy  who uh  who sat  in the  coffin  for you  when you  guys  were too  afraid  to do  it  thank god  for scorch  guys i  have some  great news  yeah  uh i'm  reading the  description of  this particular  piece of  this episode  oh 
[01:54:30]  and not only  will we see  wheel of  meat  but we  will also  see  nick's  drink to  help you  think or  at least  sink the  pain  oh  thank god  now i can  find out what  the hell that  is really  thank god  and and there's  another piece of  the article that  we need to read  sam yeah  definitely  which one of the  scorch has also  spent time  paragraph  that's where  they uh they  try to give you  a little bio  on scorch  in case  this was a big  article on  pfg tv that  made the  national  telegraph  national  telegraph  dot com  scorch has  also spent 
[01:55:00]  time as a  wrestling manager  with wwe  that would be  the world  wrestling  entertainment  yes  he said  wrestling was  another thing  that was on  his bucket  list  and after  attending  former  wrestler  killer  kowalski  list  after attending  former  wrestler  killer  kowalski's  training camp  many moons  ago  scorch found  that he could  take a fall  better than  many in the  business  he even did  a brief stint  acting as  captain lou  albano's  up and coming  son  scorch is  lying  he never 
[01:55:30]  was involved  because i  remember scorch  wanting to  get into the  whole wrestling  thing back  when we were  at aaf  and he never  he was always  talking about  how yeah i  got a call  from wwf  and there's  yeah he's  never spoken  to anyone  in wwe or  wf and he's  never ever  dare you say  that scorch  is lying  he's never  been a part  of that  organization  scorch is  a compulsive  liar  he's probably  never even  gotten like  did he go  to killer  kowalski's  school  he could  have because  anybody can  go i mean 
[01:56:00]  that could  have been  and as far  as the  captain lou  thing  has he ever  taken bumps  in the wwe  no not in  the wwf  no he's  never been  in a w  or any of  those leagues  no he's  been in  gyms  high school  gyms  has he  ever met  captain  lou albano  the only  way that  that part  could be  true is  if somebody  did it at  one of those  high school  gym shows  the same  way you  know i you  know the same  way i could  have played  captain lou's  up-and-coming  son  captain lou  it's still  real to me  man  it doesn't  even say 
[01:56:30]  captain lou  was with  him  they could  have just  introduced  him  you know  okay  he did  a brief  stint  acting as  captain lou  albano's  up-and-coming  son  he could  have done  that at  that bar  right  like it  didn't mean  it was with  the wwf  i guess that  was before  vito carlucci  his wrestling  character  well perhaps  yeah vito  carlucci was  scorch's wrestling  character  you say was  in a past tense  which i find  strange  it's still  he still 
[01:57:00]  believes he's  vito carlucci  is scorch's  uh wrestling  character as a  matter of fact he  did at least two  wrestling gigs in  syracuse as a  manager  well i uh i  apologize then  i think squared  circle wrestling  2 cw  2 cw  yeah  that's where  he's at  2 cw  uh after  the wheel of  meat and  the pfg tv  segment number  two good  news for  everybody  puppetry of  the penis  coming in 
[01:57:30]  today yes  we had these  guys  we had these  guys on  yes  almost uh  about seven  and a half  years ago  so they're  older now so  i'm assuming  they could do  a lot more  things with  their penis  a little more  fucking stretch  ability  than nutsack  yes  this is a  tarp at  shea stadion  we also  learned something  we also learned  something about  hr today  yeah  last time they  were in which  was september  24th 2001  according to  e-rock  wow  um 
[01:58:00]  really wow  yeah no  kidding  uh we went  around and  and invited all  the ladies to  come in to  check out the  show  wait when was  that  2001 just  after 9-11  oh yeah i  was gonna say  jesus christ we  we actually did  that too a  couple of weeks  after 9-11  yeah i think  they had uh  they made towers  out of their  penises and  everything  and one penis  crashed into the  other guy's penis  that was the  tower  and it got  really gay  yeah it was  very uh  yeah  awful  uh but  we want to  redo that by 
[01:58:30]  you know  walking around  the halls here  at siriusxm  and inviting the  ladies if they  want to  yeah  to check out  puppetry of the  penis which is  an off-broadway  show it's not  it's not in the  porn category  believe it or not  no they don't  sit there and  jack off or  something  they make stupid  animals out of  their uh  schweens and  their nuts  animals  cheeseburger  cheeseburgers  things just  they they  make like uh  yeah like  balloon animals  with their junk  well let me tell  you how times  have changed  and this is  satellite radio 
[01:59:00]  yeah  we're not  allowed to  even walk  around and  ask the ladies  if they want  to see this  yeah  yeah  sexual harassment  is that an  aggressive work  environment  that would be  considered some  kind of sexual  harassment  oh  fucking  yeah we can't  even ask  that's why  hr departments  suck a dick  red flag  really  yeah  in general  they do  that's every  company  it's not just  this radio 
[01:59:30]  it's every  single company  human resources  i'm not talking  about the  particular hr  department here  i'm with jimmy  every single  one of them  it's what they  do by nature  they knee-jerk  overreaction  like that you  can't hang  posters or  little cartoons  or anything  around your  cubicle because  it might offend  somebody  because the  lady might  see it  pin-up  pin-up  calendars  all that  shit  goes away  because of  this  because of  this  it's sexually  harassing  so  so now  it's a bunch  of guys  looking at  two guys 
[02:00:00]  in their  dicks  and what  they can  make out  of them  great  steve  could watch  steve  will watch  yes  oh there  he is  all right  let's get  back to  pfg tv  starring our  old pal  scorch  the wheel  of meat  the wheel  of meat  wait  welcome back  to pfg tv  the tv show  scorch  that's me  and now  this is what  i've been  looking forward  to i've been  playing this  game on the  radio for  years and  years and  years but  this is the 
[02:00:30]  first time i've  actually brought  it out live  first time  because this is  pfg tv the tv  show and this  is the game that  we call the  wheel of  we have got  on the wheel  today we have  got for you  a piece of  beef teriyaki  ladies and  gentlemen  let's hear  it for beef  teriyaki  come on  what  wait wait  he's gonna make  he's gonna make  people cheer  dude there's like  eight or ten  meats on this 
[02:01:00]  thing  easily  people gonna have  to cheer for  every meat  yeah  what an  asshole  all right  it stinks  died for that  at least we  think it's a  cow  chicken teriyaki  and a  pork strip  so the rules  are  melissa's  gonna spin  the wheel of  meat  uh if she  doesn't guess  by the sound  of nick  because nick  is gonna  spank his  meat  now melissa  has to guess 
[02:01:30]  the sound  of the meat  she knows  now it's a  one of three  chance  now if  melissa can't  guess the  sound of  nick spanking  his meat  then she's  gonna have  to lick  his meat  which would  be just  like old  times  at melissa's  house  oh my god  there's no  one there  spank that 
[02:02:00]  meat  spank  spank  the  meat  spank  the  meat  spank  the  meat  spank  the  meat  do you  know who  he looks  like right  now when  he's got  his hands  up he  looks like  the guy  that fucking  snag  plissken  killed with  the bat  and escaped  from new  york  i wish  he was  fucking  a nice  bat with  a nail  through  that is  so bad  he's 
[02:02:30]  trying  to get  a bigger  crowd  reaction  but he's  got  everybody  which is  about 12  people  reacting  yeah  he's  still  looking  for more  noise  yeah he's  working the  crowd  there's nothing  else he's getting  the maximum  value out of the  people in there  so it's an excuse  to say spank your  meat on a radio  show  you guys  you didn't steal  this one too  no  i figured you  guys would have  stolen  now they spin  the wheel  you spin the  wheel and the  wheel stops  then you take  without telling  the listeners  or in this  case the  viewers  you gotta  blindfold  whoever it  is i guess  without telling 
[02:03:00]  them what  meat it is  you take  that meat  off the  wheel  right  then you  slap the  meat against  your hand  or the  console or  whatever  but you  say now  i'm spanking  my meat  oh god  because that  could mean  something  oh jimmy  that's crazy  see it's gotta  be something  oh  it's like  double entendre  right  without the  entendre  or the  double  wouldn't all  meat sound  the same  as you  spank it  against your  hand  well that's  no i mean  that's one of  the challenges  that there are 
[02:03:30]  subtle differences  between beef  teriyaki and  chicken teriyaki  and then you  have to guess  right  now why  the wheel  why not just  have someone  turn around  say i have  three meats  here  i'm gonna  spank one  and you  have to  guess  because then  while you're  waiting to  find out  what meat  there'd be  no sound  that goes  oh  all right  and a lot  of people  claiming  colorado  brand and  many others  there's a  ripoff of  wheel of fish 
[02:04:00]  wheel of fish  from the  weird owl  yankovic  movie  no  uhf  wheel of meat  wheel of fish  did they  well but yeah  but scorch  scorch has been  at this for a  long time  there's a good  chance that him  and weird owl  used to kind of  go back and  forth with ideas  yeah i actually  wrote a lot of  songs for a  weird owl  i said i said  al you can  have that one  yeah you take  that one you  take the eat  it one  amish paradise  you take the  eat it one and  make millions  off it  i don't care  he's a good 
[02:04:30]  guy  eat it  jesus  i i i  could listen  listen to this  all day  let's see how  wheel of meat  simply the best  yes  okay you have  a choice of  pork strip  chicken teriyaki  or beef teriyaki  what do you  think it is  can i taste it  there's  melissa for you  you know what  if it's meat  oh just let me  taste the meat  got it  it's either

[02:05:30]  actually  the woman  has taste buds  this is not an  exciting game  is this a tomato  or a piece of  popcorn  fucking  horrible  his humor  back to  raging bull  it's it's  LaMotta  when he's  pretending to  sneeze as  they're filling  the champagne  glasses  that awful  oh boy  he's terrible  did I ever tell you  what we used to say  whenever one of the bits  worked in the studio 
[02:06:00]  and we knew the bit  worked because all three  phone lines lit up  wow  and when that happened  well I guess  Paul and me started  doing it ironically  but Scorch started it  where all three phones  would light up  and Scorch would go  turn to us  and go  this was not on the air  this is just  him as a human being  looking at us  and go  ooh  looky  looky  miss cookie  why didn't you  shoot him  when he said that  because  our bit was  working so well 
[02:06:30]  we had three people  calling the radio  show  and you knew  you had radio gold  yes  oh  wheel of meat  was always a  looky looky  miss cookie  type of day  really  oh yeah  looky looky  miss cookie  let's see how  he wraps up  the wheel of meat  we'll give you a prize  later  that fire  she knows her meat  she knows her meat  we still have got  legs  Zeppelin  coming in  I wish it was  great white  Vegas temper

[02:49:30]  but apparently  one guy one wheelchair  this is it right here  one guy one screwdriver  and apparently he takes  a screwdriver to his  cock hole  okay  i just got a weird  tingly  bad feeling  let's see that dan  let's see the cock  i'm not gonna watch it  i can see that  i'm not gonna watch it  put it on  that's a fetish  for some guys  it's called sounds  it's called what  sounds  guys that like  these things  i don't know  i'm not sure  where the name  came from  because he goes  that's a weird 
[02:50:00]  name for that  i don't know  i don't know  if i want to  i might  come on  fucking  man up you  coop  i might  ah dude  what the fuck  is he doing  stop it  stop it  dude  leave it on  what are you  doing  i'm watching  dude he's all  scarred up  between his legs  he's got lard  whoa he's putting  he's putting a big  cup up  yeah he's got lard  ah fuck  okay  alright i'm done  leave it there  leave it there  don't take it off  i'm done  i'm done  i'm done  i'm done  okay  i'm done  he's bleeding badly  i'm done  i'm done 
[02:50:30]  he's pulling a screwdriver  fuck fuck fuck  why are you making me  lost  Jesus Christ  here's what he did  he's uh  he's bleeding badly  from the cock  he had pushed a uh  oh my god  we thought he pushed the  you know  the screwdriver in  no it was the handle  yeah and he's bleeding  badly  i can't watch this  he's pissing blood on  purpose  stop it  turn this off  i can't look  i can't do anything  i want to sleep  tonight  i can't think  that guy's great  he's fucking great  and the fucking  screwdriver's on a 
[02:51:00]  really awful  linoleum floor  with blood  what do you think  he lives in a really  nice place  yeah they just  show the floor  he's done  he's done  he just did puppetry  of the penis  he did the Harry Capen  there's blood in the tub  he just did  he just did the JFK  the JFK  yeah he had the  fucking handle  i guess he ripped  the skin inside  because he was  bleeding  spurting blood  from his cock  you think he did  Jim  oh my god  but while he did  that he had lard  in his ass  he squatted  over a glass  and he took 
[02:51:30]  the whole fucking  glass up his asshole  i can't take that  can i please see  the one guy  one bottle  or whatever  i'm sure it's real  that's nothing  compared to this  and yeah  now i'm starting  to think it's real  dude he's bleeding  from the digital  that guy's got  like all kinds  of fucking scars  all over his asshole  and everything  he's in the body  mutilation  oh is he  by the way  he's right  one guy one cup  tearing up the charts  3.6 million views  wow  wow there are some  sick fucks out there  oh here you go  James  oh yeah  take a look 
[02:52:00]  did Bob Kelly  hate this  oh yeah  oh yeah he did  he's all scarred up  this guy's a disaster  he's squatting  yeah he's squatting  on the jar  oh god  oh god  squatting  pushing the jar  further and further  in  i can't watch this  his asshole is way  open  can't watch this  listen  listen  wait for him  oh  the glass broken  his ass  holy fuck 
[02:52:30]  he's now trying to  pull  the broken  jar out of his ass  broken glass shards  and now blood is dripping  pouring  pouring  out of his ass  i can't believe this  i can't fucking look  i wonder if he does  did he break it on purpose  i don't know  holy shit  and he's very calm  as far as trying to get  the glass out of his ass  yeah i'd be panicking  watching  you think this is real  jimmy  yes  you think this is real  without a doubt  this may have been an accident  because uh  i've seen like 
[02:53:00]  obviously that screwdriver one  and there's another video i saw  and apparently this guy  he loves sticking glass bottles  in his ass  so i think maybe this one  broke by accident  maybe by accident  but he's not panicking  because he's all scarred up  he's been hurt before  yeah something like this  has definitely happened before  i was just pulling pieces of uh  what's the matter  i'm not looking at this  it's actually done  this is so bad  shut up  i saw this clip jimmy  you're not gonna fucking  catch me like that  his hands are bleeding badly  um  this is kind of nauseating actually 
[02:53:30]  i'm not looking  at least the camera angle is better  so the camera angle is better  yeah yeah  it's fucking scorch  did bob kelly puke  pfg tv  i'm gonna sit on a jar  yeah bob kelly was like puking  this guy's asshole is being held wide open  i'm not looking  oh god  i can't  he's just picking glass up out of his asshole  very calm though  yeah he's handling it well  this guy handles pressure well  everybody else would be screaming their ass  must be a relief pitcher  screaming their ass  well  i think there's some noise at the end 
[02:54:00]  that was put in  it's not this guy  what do you mean  i i i can't  oh they put in like a  they dub some shit  yeah like a scream or something  oh he's picking it out  he can still feel it's up there  how do people see this tanny  well they can go to my  they have a nightmare  yeah they can go to my favorite  actually it's mogulist.com  slash anthony kumi  oh no  anthony radio  anthony radio  no it's actually efukt  efukt.com  it's probably one of my favorite  websites  who is this guy  oh someone just linked it  yeah that  see that's  who is that guy  i think um 
[02:54:30]  i think he does crazy stuff  apparently  i think there's some kind of a trick involved there  this guy uh  i think he actually posts  in the forums  of this website  and i think that's how these videos came out  oh god  you know like  every medium has some weirdo  that does weird shit  like i remember on pal talk  somebody sent me a video of some guy  putting a slice of pizza  in his ass  yeah yeah  and then taking it out  and eating it  so i mean this  i'm sure shit like that  then again it could have been  that looked real  because the way his asshole opened so  for you to be able to take that in your asshole 
[02:55:00]  yeah yeah  but it could have been one of those breakable bottles  that you see in movies  which are  you could break  i had a bottle broken across my head in a movie  and it's like a sugar thing  it doesn't hurt you at all  yeah  but  i think there's some kind of trick there  but again dude  he's so scarred up  no i  yeah well he's obviously putting  huge things in his ass  look we like to think it's fake  just for our own fucking sanity  that is real  but we just saw that  yuck  god damn  yeah i want to see bob's reaction  dude i i've uh 
[02:55:30]  a lot of people think the video is real  that's absolutely real  okay  yeah we could do that  let's do bob's reaction into break  god  that's unsettling  i can handle a lot  that's uncomfortable  same video we just played  this is the time we played it for bob kelly  a very different reaction  quick break  and then we're gonna get an update on miss california  and do some other things  thanks  they have to just irrigate your asshole  with like water or something  how would they do that  where they wouldn't push it farther into you  i i don't care  i don't know  its right eye is closed 
[02:56:00]  i i i'm like wince  i'm wincing  at the thought of this  could your instinct be to close your asshole  and that would suck the glass up farther  would it  the first time i watched that video  i'm turning into popeye  obviously i didn't know what was coming  and i tapped out  the minute i heard that glass break  and like i knew what was coming  i was like  like i saw there was still like  two minutes left of the video  i'm like no i'm not watching this  you can't watch the rest  i couldn't do it  yeah that is bad  that's upsetting  the worst was to be  watching that guy get murdered  is the worst i've ever seen  that's bad  i don't need to say that 
[02:56:30]  guy would just kill the screwdriver  why don't we take a break  so this is bob's reaction  to that same video  we just played for jimmy  hey bob are you ready to see the video  i uh  the only thing that makes me laugh about  i hate when you guys show me these videos  and i puke  and here comes sam with a camera  so you know it's bad  of course  no it's not bad  anthony's  your cackle  dude  during two girls one cup  no  that makes me  for some reason that cackle  that you had going  was funny to me  it starts a chain reaction  you can just hear you  your dry heaving 
[02:57:00]  starts me cackling  i can't  there's nothing funnier  than watching someone puke  or dry heav  yeah  i don't know why  it's just funny  all right  here we go  for bobby  we're showing a video  whoa  i don't like it already  wait wait  he turned around  will you stop the video  hold on  what are you doing bobby  is that a  is that a  it's a jar on the floor  what's on his  what's on the  don't even try to describe it  go back  is what it is  now we gotta start over bobby  is he european  why is it like that  who cares  oh that isn't even

[02:59:30]  jim norton  doing red eye tonight  on the fox news channel  with greg gutfeld  yes  so make sure you  take a look at that  tonight or dvr it  uh in the news  steven hawken  we were talking about  him yesterday  yeah  he's terminally ill  or something like that  they said he's really  really sick  that's what they said 
[03:00:00]  the update today  steven hawken  is going to make  a full  and  complete  recovery  good  to what point  exactly  like  that's what the news  story said though  a full and  and complete  recovery  yeah  back to where  he was  which was  well  horribly ill  a full and complete  recovery to me  means he's going to  be running  you know  next year's  boston marathon  how you doing  everybody  right  god i'm smart  yeah  full and complete 
[03:00:30]  not not complete  i think the news  has a sense of humor  that's how they were  reporting that  this morning  don't we have  kaku in tomorrow  hey  we had kaku  just before  we had a lot  of kaku today  dr michu kaku  is tomorrow right  michu kaku  and then friday's  yari coleman  oppi and anthony  he still doesn't  remember me  i see him around  the building  he has no recollection  of who i am  i am dr michu kaku  and i want to talk  to you about  yeah i see him on the  what is he on the  science channel  and  sciq sundays 
[03:01:00]  sciq sundays  join me every sunday  and test your  sciq  sciq  i'm dr michu  kaku  every 45 seconds  on that fucking  chat  yeah  dr michu  kaku  so if there was  an ant  would the aliens  talk to ants  no  he's so used  to talking to  people  he makes little  corny jokes  he's so used  to talking to  people  that are 90  iq points  below him  oh yeah  just morons  everyone he  it's like us  talking to  turtles  that's how he 
[03:01:30]  looks at most  people  try to explain  yeah  the internal  combustion engine  to a frog  but he almost  sounds like a  crackpot  because he goes  it's like on  star trek  he's trying to  explain really  complex  physics  to fucking  laymen  and he's pretty  good at it  yeah because he  does use things  that people  you know  it's almost  insulting  if it wasn't  completely necessary  it's almost like  all right forget  the star trek  just explain it  if you were talking  to another  if you were talking  to you know  another physicist 
[03:02:00]  you wouldn't go  it's like in  star wars  yes  you would just  spit it out  yeah you would  say like you do  in scientist talk  try to take tomorrow  off  explain it  like you would  to a child  i want to take  tomorrow off  that universe stuff  creeps me out  yeah  the universe is pretty  big  you see the  saturn pictures  yeah  well those are  pretty cool  to check out  the great  cassini  satellite  hey speaking  of space  that astronaut  we never got  frontier  we never got  to it yesterday  the astronaut  saying look  there are aliens 
[03:02:30]  visiting us  the government's  covering it up  you know that old  story but it's a  new  this is a new  astronaut right  really  or is it the  same one that  we've talked  about in the  past  it's a different  one  yeah he  a recent  astronaut  I think he  did his  flights in  like the  90s  so his brain  should still  be there  what did he  say  because the  old astronaut  did he see  something  well and then  he's like  Obama's got  to open  the files  and Obama  seems to be  doing everything  differently  so maybe  maybe Obama  opened some  files for us  he opens  files all right 
[03:03:00]  CIA files  about waterboarding  and the report  came out  because of that  that insane  waterboarding  that our boys  were doing  that they got  some great  info  of course  they did  that's also  good though  that's the only  thing that should  matter  see I'm not  an Obama guy  all the time  man see  they're talking  about fucking  Khalid  Muhammad  that they  they waterboarded  him  he's the guy  that fucking  masterminded  September 11  yes  153 times  they waterboarded  him  good  good  god are we 
[03:03:30]  a fucking  nation  dummies  Obama  fucking  says  that will  never happen  again  we will not  use that  technique  and then  they're talking  about actually  prosecuting  certain people  that were  responsible  for the  waterboarding  waterboarding  by the way  is a torture  technique  they call it  a torture  technique  it's an  interrogation  technique  where you  make the  person feel  like you're  fucking  drowning  them  you hold  them underwater  you're 
[03:04:00]  drowning  them  and then  you bring  them up  at the  last minute  and make  them go  alright  here's the  plan  and they  said that  they actually  thwarted  the Los  Angeles  terrorist plot  through  information  garnered  through  waterboarding  so we  as Americans  would rather  politely  talk through  a lawyer  yes  and we  would have  people  these are  religious  people  they're  fucking  willing  to die  they don't  they're not  afraid to go  to jail  but the  immediacy of 
[03:04:30]  death like  that will  probably get  somebody talking  we fucking  we almost  deserve to  get attacked  we're so  fucking  stupid  we are not  stupid  this motherfucker  is stupid  what an  asshole  the president  is  he's an  asshole  the fucking  attorney general  is an  asshole  it's  it's  stunning  to me  that  they've  forgotten  what happened  on September  11th  they've just  forgotten  his strategy  is to  brown nose  the entire  world  and see if  that turns  things around  he thinks  by walking 
[03:05:00]  around  shaking hands  and smiling  he absolutely  thinks that the  world is going  to go  oh America's  not that  bad  then  that's quite  a gamble  my friends  quite a gamble  to take  thanks  I understand  torture not  being used  on soldiers  I understand  but the  level of  what you're  preventing  you're  preventing  attacks  that are  going to  kill  thousands  of people  at a clip  these are  not just  random  incidents  these are  not just  people with  certain  military  information  these are  people who 
[03:05:30]  know the  exact  details of  terrorist  attacks  and we  are all  it's like  fucking  there's no  common sense  and it  didn't  say  the memo  didn't say  that they  were  waterboarding  everybody  they were  they have  instructions  that they  were to  use  certain  techniques  on high  high level  people that  they have  down in  Guantanamo  and only  if they  weren't  talking  at first  he said  you know  you'll see 
[03:06:00]  that's what  they said  Khalid Sheikh  Mohammed  he said  tell us  what's being  planned  what's going  on  you know  getting info  from him  and he goes  you'll see  soon enough  you'll see  soon enough  a few  dunks  in the  old  fucking  tank  and he  was  a  blithering  blathering  idiot  on  everything  Al-Qaeda  but no  I guess  what we  should have  done  once again  the left  is completely  in touch  with how  to handle  foreign policy  not that  Bush was  great  but when  it came  to this  stuff  I  backed  the way 
[03:06:30]  he handled  it  I guess  we should  have just  been  polite  right  we should  have just  been  polite  and then  allowed  more  fucking  office  workers  to jump  out the  90th  floor  window  Obama  must have  been busy  that day  I don't  think Obama  was watching  TV that  day  I don't  think he  heard about  9-11  or anything  I think  he was very  busy  getting some  kind of  social program  together for  the poor  in Chicago  this guy  is completely  out of touch  and has no  idea what  the real  world is like  people hate 
[03:07:00]  this country  they hated  this country  before George  Bush too  mind you  I know  George  Bush didn't  go around  making the  rest of the  world love  us  that's for  sure  but they  hated this  country  our ideals  our values  our government  everything  they're  religious  fanatics  that don't  like us  because we're  not the  same religion  it's not  going to  change by  shaking their  fucking hand  and bowing  to them  they're beheading  people and  this asshole  wants to 
[03:07:30]  possibly prosecute  people in the  CIA you  fucking  traitor  that's a  traitor  he's a  traitor  if you  prosecute  people in the  CIA for  questioning  however they  question  al-Qaeda  top lieutenants  and protecting  Americans from  from terrorists  as far as I'm  concerned  you're a  traitor  totally  yeah  Jonas in  Jersey wants  him because  he wants to  revise your  description of  waterboarding  let's see what  Jonas has to  say about that  Jonas  good evening  good evening  good evening  uh  I just want to  tell you how  much of a 
[03:08:00]  push of  our nation  we are  it's actually  way less  harmless than  dunking your  head in a  tank of  water  they actually  wrap a  bandana around  your nose  you can't  really breathe  through your  nose and  they just  pour water  over your  face so it  does feel like  you're drowning  because you  can't get your  breath there's  water pouring  into your mouth  and nose and  stuff but there's  no chance of  you drowning  and here we  are crying about  how we're hurting  these people who  fucking blew up  3,000 people  yeah maybe  head people  and everything  and then you  know we use  these techniques  to get the  information out 
[03:08:30]  of them and  we're the bad  guys of course  and Obama knows  how you know  oh we can't  we can't do  that in this  world we have  to set an  example of  good and  we did  and before you  know it  kablooey  buildings are  blowing up  we set an  example of a  country that  was too polite  to stop giving  out student  visas so we  took a big  dick in the  ass and the  whole country  was outraged  that a few  years passed  nothing happens  because of what  the CIA is  doing and we  cry that the 
[03:09:00]  CIA is not  being polite  to fucking  high level  religious fanatics  who target  civilians  yeah  we got Mike  he's an  interrogator for  the US Army  on the line  Mikey  hey what's  going on  god bless  what you do  Mikey  well let me  tell you I  just got back  from Iraq and  these guys  100% have no  problem going  to jail for  the rest of  their lives  or dying  as long as  they kill  one person  if waterboarding  works and  trust me I've  had it done  to me it  does it  has to be  done  yeah it's 
[03:09:30]  it's it  just astounds  me what  happened  how did  how did  people just  forget about  what was  going on  well  and and  and the fact  of the matter  is there  have been  plots  that were  you know  they found  out about  them through  these  techniques  these interrogation  techniques  and  uh  Obama  is now  telling  Obama's  now pretty  much  saying  you don't  have to  worry  if you're  captured  we're not  going to do  anything that's 
[03:10:00]  really going to  get the  information from  you so you  don't have to  worry  no I mean  when we're  over there  interrogating  people  they'll  literally  look at  us  and tell  them  we're  violating  their  civil  rights  these  people  think  they have  American  civil rights  because we  captured them  how will  the CIA  look the  CIA  they're going  to get  around it  there's no  way  uh  they're going  to allow  this  fucking  jackass  to just  tell the  whole world  oh we  were naughty  for interrogating  these people  too harshly  if there's  threats 
[03:10:30]  though of  prosecution  dude  if there's  threats of  prosecution  what guy  in his  right mind  is going  to risk  going to  prison  for  interrogating  somebody  you're now  going to  toe the  line  be a good  boy  not get  the information  and wait  until you know  we have another  attack  and they were  targeting the  White House  apparently they  couldn't find it  which is why  they hit the  Pentagon  but from the  air you did  the White House  they wanted  to hit the  White House  the president  probably wouldn't  have been there  but they were 
[03:11:00]  targeting the  president  well Rick  the other  side here  from Missouri  so do you  want to see  our soldiers  waterboarded  waterboarded  excuse me  as I said  before  these are  high level  religious fanatics  these are not  foot soldiers  I'm not talking  about guys  that are in  the field  fighting  I'm not  talking about  that  he's saying  they will  do it  if we do  they'll do it  anyway  they cut  their fucking  heads off  you idiot  they fucking  drag American  bodies through  the street  they fucking 
[03:11:30]  beheaded  that one  some of those  three soldiers  they captured  they hang them  upside down  on bridges  what is that guy  an idiot  do you listen  to the fucking  news  do you watch  do you read  what do you do  those soldiers  would have loved  to have been  waterboarded  I'm sure  instead of  have their heads  sawed off  see people don't  watch the  beheading videos  watch the  beheading video  of the Black Hawk  helicopter pilot  who's beheaded  watch the videos  it makes  playing naked 
[03:12:00]  pyramid  in a prison  look like  nothing  believe me  bunch of  fucking people  that want to  sit home  and complain  and it's like  at least  watch the  video  and listen  to them  reading that  religious shit  and then  fucking  lopping  somebody's  head off  with a  fucking  butcher  knife  unbelievable  we got  some info  coming in  from Dan  Turner  who used  to be  an XM  employee  huge fan  of the  Opie and  Anthony  show  it's good  to see  that he's  doing well  Dan  Turner  still listens  to our  show  God bless  him  he writes  the numbers  on the  waterboarding  aren't  individual  sessions 
[03:12:30]  but the  tally of  water  drops  maybe  30  per  session  nobody  was  waterboarded  hundreds  of times  drops  of water  though  not drops  but every time  your head  goes under  it's probably  considered  a drop  or a poor  the thing  is  when  Obama  released  classified  CIA  memos  fucking  idiot  he released  fucking  classified  CIA  memos  to  make  people  aware  that  this  torture  was  going  on  but 
[03:13:00]  left  out  the  parts  here's  Mr.  transparency  in government  once again  Mr.  I'm  transparent  you'll be  able to  see  and know  this is  an open  administration  left  out  the  parts  that said  that  those  techniques  got  results  and the  results  that they  got  were  finding  out  that  there  were  plans  to  hijack  airliners  in  Asia  and fly  into  Los Angeles 
[03:13:30]  that  was  directly  that  information  directly  came  from  waterboarding  of  prisoners  here's  this  root cause  guilty  American  shit  that the  president's  practicing  the whole  thing  and we  all knew  it  when  Jeremiah  Wright  was  saying  the  chickens  come  home  to  roost  that  means  it's  our  fault  and  we  deserve  what  we  got  on  September  11th  change  foreign  policies  and  then  nothing  will  happen  so  that  completely  takes  away  the  horrible  religious  fanaticism 
[03:14:00]  motives  of the  people  doing it  it  automatically  means  they're  only  reacting  to  American  terribleness  where to  blame  always  to  blame  Steve  in New  York  disagrees  with what  you  just  said  Anthony  let's  go to  Steve  Steve  I will 
[03:14:30]  if  and  I  would  if  I  didn't  think  you  were  going  to  go  frunkus  and  goof  on  me  because  you  absolutely  know  that  information  came  out  absolutely  not  absolutely  name it  okay  alright  here  I go  name  one instance  where  waterboarding  produced  results  that

[03:19:30]  Just like what a fucking  A guy who just  That's that guilty  It's always America's fault  We get it Bush was terrible  We get it  He didn't do anything right  But the CIA did release things  To fucking  They had to  Because Obama was making them look bad  Which is great for the president to do  To his own intelligence agency  Make the CIA look bad  You know  He  That idiot doesn't understand  They released  The rest of those documents  To show that 
[03:20:00]  Hey the president left something out  There was results from this  And he goes  There wasn't results  Well  How do you know  They just released  Show me one case  And then you showed him a case  And he just can't  Yeah but when he said  He reads US News and Report  You should have said  Well I read Us Weekly  Yes  I read people  New York Times came out  With a report that  We got info from Waterboarding  You can look that up  Of course we did  You want to go with another  Ant's completely wrong  Where was he  Yeah I'd like to hear  Ant's wrong  How could a guy  Justify that 
[03:20:30]  When did you guys become Fox News  Yesterday  It's amazing  People can't handle  You criticize Obama  You're Fox News  Shut the fuck up  Sorry I'm not MSNBC  With my nose nuzzled up  His fucking crack hole  Holy shit  We did two hours of cock jokes  In a little  Just a little politics today  We talked about poopy  Yeah we did poopy  We did cock  We did Fox News  We did  Strap-ons up the ass  What else did we do today  On the show Danny  A man bent his penis  Into a hamburger  Yes  How was that on Fox News 
[03:21:00]  His giant sack  Into a wind sail  Who didn't appreciate  The wind sail  You're not going to see  Sean Hannity doing that  And then we watched  A video of a man  Sticking the handle  Of a screwdriver  Into his cock hole  Until he bled  And then picking glass  Out of his asshole  And then we listened  To our friend vomit  Could you get E-Rock in here  I think we got to pass  That bit on to Sean Hannity  I think that would be  A big hit on Fox News  Oh yeah  You want another one Ant  Well let's see  We'll handle this one  I want to go to Mark  In North Carolina  Because we all need  A little Truman knowledge 
[03:21:30]  Today  Mark  Yes  Go ahead  Hi guys  I think you guys  I think you guys  Need to just take a breath  And calm down a little bit  What you're forgetting  Mountain pose everyone  Everyone up  What you're forgetting  Is the most important  Lesson of the 20th century  That Harry Truman taught us  If you want to  Beat your enemy  I'm listening to this guy  Talk about the atom bombs  Oh I'm sorry  Yes  If you want to  If you want to beat your enemy  The only way to beat him  Is to be  Twice as brutal  As he is  Exactly  Harry Truman proved that 
[03:22:00]  That deserves a holla  Holla  But it's not  The bottom line is  It's not even targeting soldiers  Or guys that are just  Doing their  These are fucking people  Targeting civilians  They're trying to kill  Civilians  They know civilians  Have no defense against them  They're targeting civilians  And we cry if the government  Doesn't protect us  I'm getting more knowledge  Michael in Toronto writes  Biggums magazine  Says no info came from  Waterboarding 
[03:22:30]  Biggums  My favorite  Magazine title of all time  I dare you to come up  With a better magazine title  What are they writing  In honcho  Biggums and rules  Puerto Rican inches  Says  Is there a Biggums website  Puerto Rican inches  Black inches  There's another one too  They're both bad  Of course  Of course  I mean  Subscribe to it  Yeah like I don't know  Come on Jimmy  Is there a Biggums website  Unbelievable that guy  But just  But the whole ranty 
[03:23:00]  And it's like  If they were torturing  Soldiers just to get information  They should not be doing that  Not low level guys  But if you have the number  Three guy at Al-Qaeda  Who people in Pakistan  Were telling you  This is the guy  And we knew it was the guy  You have to get the information  How do you get information  Out of a guy  Who's a religious fanatic  He's not even a soldier  Yeah  He's a religious fanatic  It's based on the desire  These are guys that are  Willing to send their own guys  To die  Because they think  They're going to see God  In 20 minutes  It's just  You can't reason 
[03:23:30]  With people like that  No  So you fucking use  Whatever techniques you can  To get the information from them  Can I run down the phones  Because we'll never get to everybody  Oh yeah  Because we do try to do something  That's a little different  Than Fox News  And MSNBC  So this is what's coming in  I'm not editing  Curt in Delaware  If we're humanitarians  We need to set the example  And not waterboard  We also got  We should let Saudi Arabia  Take care of it  We're humanitarians  We're not fucking  Sacrificial lambs  Right  We're not torturing civilians 
[03:24:00]  Chris in Texas  We waterboard our own soldiers  In training  Pork chop  The trucker  Waterboarding is not  The worst thing we've done  Yeah I'd love to  Hear about the other stuff  That we don't  Hear about  They're the show  In demonstration now  I would love it  Oh is that waterboarding  Right there  Yeah it's awful  Oh that's fantastic  Josh  Good  Josh in New Hampshire writes  I'm an Iraqi  An Iraq vet  Just because Obama  Wants to change things  Doesn't mean interrogation  Will change  James I just read in Lips  That we got no info  From waterboarding 
[03:24:30]  In Lips  Wow  Is that a better magazine  Than Biggums  Lips is pretty good  What's Swank saying  And Biggums  Is spelled B-I-G-E-M-S  Danny  Is it  Yes  I did two tours  In Iraq  Waterboarding is necessary  Russ in Texas  Obama was just  Trying to point out  Bush's hypocrisy  And then you got  Jay in Ohio  Anthony is  A douche  Correct  I can't see  Let me look  Completely wrong  Completely wrong  Was the correct answer 
[03:25:00]  Alright  Let me just plunk him  Down for a minute  For real  Yeah I just want to  See why  I'm not going to  Get on him  I just want to  Know why  Keep it  Keep it  Keep it  I'll keep it  Very civil  Jay  Nice  Jay  I did a 30  Can we keep  We're going to be  Civil about this  Can we keep this  Civil  Okay why am I wrong  Okay I'm going to  Start off  Little Jimmy was  Talking about  Pete Dominick  He has a show  On XM POTUS  He had an FBI agent  On that had  Information  Had wrote a book  Talked to a lot  Of Al-Qaeda members  And did not have 
[03:25:30]  To use torture  Second  Hold on  Let me ask you  Let me ask you  About the thing  You just said  Did the FBI agent  What level  Al-Qaeda guys  Did he question  Top level  Top level  When he was  Interviewed on  Pete Dominick's show  He had to go  By a fake name  Because there are  People actually  Looking for him  To kill him  And his family  So he wrote a book  Under a fake name  Yeah  You get paid  When you do that  Exactly  What do you call it  Well 
[03:26:00]  Alright go ahead  Happy ending  Second  There's a  The Geneva Convention  It's written right there  We're part of  The Geneva Code  It's written right there  We're not supposed  To do it  Let me  It's illegal  Let me ask you this  How do you  Again when you're  Dealing with guys  Like Khaled Sheikh Mohammed  Or if we were ever  Able to get our hands  On fucking  How do you say  Al-Zawahari  The number two  The Egyptian surgeon  Who's right behind  Bin Laden  And who's like  The real spiritual  Fucking crusader 
[03:26:30]  In Al-Qaeda  You get your hands  On guys  On this level  Who are the guys  That are not  Going to die  Themselves  But are sending  People to do it  They're plotting it  They're planning it  They're funding it  How do you handle them  How do you handle  A guy like Khaled Sheikh Mohammed  When you sit him down  And he goes  You'll find out  Soon enough  What should we do  The thing is  We have to follow  The laws  That we are  Supposed to follow  So let's just say  Hold on  What should we do  To stop  The attacks  This is not just about  Finding out stuff 
[03:27:00]  In the past  This is about  Preventing  Things that are  Currently being planned  Which are going to  Kill thousands  Of civilians  We have to follow  We have to follow  The laws  Alright let me  Now you've said  That three times  And I'm going to  Answer you that  In this instance  We are not  These are not  Prisoners of war  My friend  So we are not  Holden to the  Geneva Convention  In this case  We're not  Yes 
[03:27:30]  These are  We are  No we're not  No we're not  Yes we are  No we're not  No we're not  We're not  And also  Also  The statements  That were released  By Obama  They were  Had to be released  Because a news  Agency  Sued  And they had  To be released  From the  Freedom of  Information Act  Okay but let me  Ask you this though  Let's just say  For the sake of  Argument they had  Caught Khalid Sheikh  Mohammed  In July  Of 2001  And had him 
[03:28:00]  And let's just say  We had the gift  Of hindsight  Or whatever it was  Or foresight  And waterboarding him  Would have gotten him  To throw up the  Information about  What was coming  On September 11th  Because we know  What happened  We never will know  What would have  Happened in Los Angeles  Airport because  The attack was  Stopped so it  Seems like a  Non-event  But let's just  Say that we  Could have gone  Back to July  Of 2001  And had  Khalid Muhammad  Waterboarding gets  The information  Not waterboarding  He sits there  And goes  You'll find out  Soon enough  Because he's  Willing to go  To jail  For the rest 
[03:28:30]  Of his life  What's your  Answer  Yeah  My answer  As painful as it is  And I know  I'm wrong  To say this  We have to  Waterboard him  But I know  It's wrong  I know it's wrong  Okay  Okay  But you do see  But dude  You do see  The waterboarding  It's still wrong  It's not wrong  It's not wrong  Do you know  The Geneva Convention  Only applies to  Other countries  Soldiers  It's soldiers  In a war  It's not  It's not terrorists  Criminals  Isn't it a war in terror? 
[03:29:00]  Yeah  It's a war  These aren't  These aren't  A country  These aren't  A country's  A sovereign nation's  Soldiers  We're not taking  Ex-Iraqi soldiers  That we were in the war  With in Iraq  And torturing them  We are taking  Terrorists  Is it a way  Around the law?  Maybe  I think it might be  A little loophole  But it's not breaking  The Geneva Convention  It doesn't apply here  Right  It's like saying  These guys 
[03:29:30]  These guys  Don't have the rights  By that statement  Right there  You know  No  They don't have the rights  By that statement  No  My statement  Was to  The statement  Right there  You made  Is saying  Well  Is there a loophole?  Yeah  That means you know  Technically  You're not supposed to do it  Nope  That was just  To liberals  That statement  That statement  That I made  Was just to the liberals  To say  Look  If it's a loophole  It's a loophole 
[03:30:00]  Whatever the fuck it is  I don't think it is  I'm saying  What I'm saying is  That they're not  Under our constitution  They're not under our laws  For fucking  Speedy trial  They're not under our laws  For cruel and unusual punishment  Or the Geneva fucking convention  They are there  Because they are trying  To kill us  And we are finding out  How  When  Where  Why  And avoiding it  And we have  Since 2001  That pirate that we caught 
[03:30:30]  We're not supposed to  Treat him a certain way  Who?  Are we just  Yes  Are we just supposed to  Beat him up  No  No  Whatever the hell we want to  No listen  Dude  How deluded this guy is  He was  No matter what  Wrong  He was arrested  Wrong does not make it right  Dude  That guy is afforded  The constitutional  Stop talking to Anthony Finish  That guy is afforded rights  Under our laws  Because he is under arrest  By American  And not by the military 
[03:31:00]  He is under arrest  For committing a crime  And the CIA is not a military  The FBI is not  The military  So they're there to collect  Intelligence  To protect our national security  That's their job  But they're not military  Hey Mike  I have a question  Hey Mike  Mike  Stop you  Mike  Mike  Stop  Mike  No  Mike  No  Do you really think  Are you comparing  Mike  Will you stop  Shut up  Holy shit  You're a horrible 
[03:31:30]  Conversation haver  One thing  At a fucking time  One shit at a time  Are you really comparing  Shut your ass  I'm talking  Are you  Are you really comparing  Are you really comparing  The arrest of this fucking  18 year old pirate  To Khaled Sheikh Mohammed  Is that the fucking  Best example  You can pull up  No you just made it for me  By saying that  He's not under military arrest  But he's also not a high level 
[03:32:00]  Terrorist  He's not a high level terrorist  It doesn't matter  He's still a person  We understand that  He's still a person like a person  Oh you fucking child  Not in every case  You don't  You're right  So Khaled Sheikh Mohammed  But why did you say  That he's a person  Why did you say  You would have  Waterboarded him then  Like I said  It's wrong  But why did you say  You would have done it  So what  You admit it's wrong  Because the situation  Jimmy gave  I'm sorry  I have to do it 
[03:32:30]  Looking at hindsight  So how about the  How about the  Potential LAX attack  How about the potential  Los Angeles airport attack  Or Los Angeles attack  With the Asian airline  Yeah  How about knowing  That was coming  Or how about  Getting that information  It's still wrong  But should they have  Done it or not  Give him cookies  Talk to him  Give him cookies and milk  And talk to him  Hopefully they'll give up  The information  Why pressure him  That's it  Obama's great  He's amazing  He treats everyone nicely 
[03:33:00]  And everyone will love  This country  Alright thank you  Thank you  No not hold on  You just keep talking  You're just yapping  Over everybody  Alright Jay  Thank you  We gave you  Goodbye  We gave you almost 10 minutes  Oh my god  I just can't believe  There are people like this  Out there  It stuns me  It stunts me to no end  That 100% of this nation  Doesn't remember 9-11  That it's not everybody  Like that there is  Actually people out there  That do not remember  People falling to their deaths  Because fire was at their backs 
[03:33:30]  That they had to jump out of a building  One of the tallest in the world  And plummet to their deaths  And they just  They forget about  The next day  Everybody  Everybody  Wanted fucking blood  Everyone  And now it's like  They're people  They're people  Shut the fuck up  Here's what liberals have done  They're not  You have allowed your hatred  Of Bush  And your hatred 
[03:34:00]  Of the Bush administration  To cloud the appropriate hatred  You should have  Of people that were  Legitimately being targeted  By him  Like you want to complain  About the Iraq war  Fine  But the people that were  Legitimately targeted  In Al-Qaeda  And who were legitimately  Fucking waterboarded  For information  You're allowing your hatred  Of Bush and Cheney  And the Halliburton stuff  And a lot of the  Legitimate arguments you have  You're allowing all that  To bleed into  What is the right stuff  Even though he was a boob 
[03:34:30]  He didn't do  Every single thing wrong  Right  It wasn't  Everything he did  Wasn't completely wrong  No matter how much  You dislike a president  You can't say that  Every single act  Yeah  Was wrong  Well the instant feedback  Went nuts  So you want me to read  A few of these  Don't doubt it  Okay  Boobieman writes  According to  Blackzilla.com  Boobieman?

[03:35:00]  That torture  Never produced any info  Yeah  Fast Friday  Jamaica station  Over 40 says  That all this torture talk  Is a bunch of bunk  And it's for the queers  Over 40  Scott S. from Quakertown  writes  Blacktail Magazine  Says  That's one of my favorites  Waterboarding is racist  Sean in Monroe, New Jersey  I read and shaved  I read and shaved  Snizz  That waterboarding  Did bring positive results  Ah see 
[03:35:30]  And Chris in  Reading, Pennsylvania  Writes  I'm currently reading  A placemat at my local  Diner and see nothing  About waterboarding  Ask him how he's doing  With the maze  On the back  Oh I don't know  I just  I'm fucking flabbergasted  But the example  Is a guy  Like we're talking about  High level operatives  Who have all this information  They're targeting  Thousands of civilians  At a time  They're trying to get  Weapons of  You know  Fucking like  They would love nothing more  Than to drop a fucking  Suitcase nuke in New York  Oh would they fucking love that 
[03:36:00]  A dirty bomb  We're not talking about  A pirate  Yeah  We're not talking about  Targeting every criminal  Yeah  It's like  We're not talking about  Targeting every soldier  No  No one is talking about that  There are restrictions  On how and what level  Of supposed torture  You could use  On enemy combatants  As they've been called  There are levels  That you use  There's a protocol there  They think  They fucking think  You're just grabbing  These innocent people 
[03:36:30]  And shoving their heads  In fucking water  It's  That isn't what's happening  Guys like the guys  That just called up  And like were so  Completely refusing  To yield an inch  Yeah  Guys like that  Remind me of women  Who go like  And marry Richard Ramirez  When he's in prison  For raping and murdering  Oh yeah  They're these fucking people  Who are so  Deluded  They think that if they  Align themselves  Or somehow show gentleness  Or love  Towards the evil  Or rotten thing  That that thing  Won't hurt them  It's just silly 
[03:37:00]  Do you think  Do you honestly  Let me give you  A great example here  Of trying to  Have a rational conversation  With a madman  Do you think  Any  The most intelligent  Debater  Of Jewish descent  Would have been able  To sit down  With Adolf Hitler  And talk him out  Of his beliefs  On hating the Jews  Do you honestly think  Any amount 
[03:37:30]  Of sitting and talking  With him  Would have stopped him  From his want  To exterminate the Jews  From the face of the earth  No  You had to kill him  Why are you answering  Your own question  That was  That would have been fun  I want to hear from  Any of these idiots  That are calling that  Don't believe in waterboarding  And everything  Because that's the same  Mindset these motherfuckers  Have  They just want us  Dead  They want us 
[03:38:00]  Dead  They don't want to talk  They don't want  Concessions  They don't want us  To give them this  Or take that  Or got  They want us  Dead  Because we don't  Believe in their  God  And their way  Of life  We are horrible  To them  The women  Being able to  Walk around exposed  Is  Fucking vulgar  To them  It infuriates  Them  And they want  Us  Gone  Let's go to the phones  Again  I can't go to them  But just so we get 
[03:38:30]  All opinions  Out there  Tony in Florida  I agree with that  And Jim  These people are  Fucking animals  Dave in Kansas City  People are forgetting  What type of people  These terrorists are  Mark in North Carolina  There's only one crime  Listed in the constitution  Do you know what that is  Ant?  What's that?  One crime listed  In the constitution  Let me see  Prohibition  And then it was  Repealed  Piracy  Pirates are criminals  Terrorists attack  National security  That's Rick in Missouri 
[03:39:00]  Geneva Convention  Only applies to soldiers  That's Trevor in Texas  Mike in El Paso  Doesn't anyone remember  People getting  Their heads  Cut off  Former Green Beret  Paul writes  These callers  Got me pissed off  I know  Screwy Louie and Buffalo  I don't care if they  Hold a flamethrower  To their feet  So a lot more people  Agreeing with you  At this point  Than earlier  And Chris in South Carolina  If waterboarding's wrong  What about the  Fucking A-bomb?  Because it's the people  The people you're talking  About waterboarding  Are not foot soldiers 
[03:39:30]  We're not talking  About just guys  That were fucking  Picking up arms  And fighting  I'm not talking  About those guys  Talking about guys  That you know  When you're on that level  In the intelligence community  You know if you have  Somebody who knows something  They don't have  They don't have any idea  Of what the Geneva  Like they pull out  The Geneva Convention  Having no idea  What it is  What it applies to  It doesn't apply  To these people  Neither does  The Constitution  They're in Guantanamo Bay 
[03:40:00]  Under the jurisdiction  Of Homeland Security  Who can go down there  The CIA  And question these people  And use tactics  That are completely acceptable  We demand protection  And then fucking bellyache  Because the methods  Are unpleasant  Yeah  Let's go to the former  Another conspiracy theory  Will come up  If we fucking slip up  And don't interrogate people  Misinformation  And then get attacked again  These same motherfuckers 
[03:40:30]  Will be going  It was an inside job  Man  The government  The Republicans  This one  That one  Shut up  Let's go to the former  Green Beret  Paul in Texas  Paul you're on  The Opie and Anthony show  Good evening  Hey Paul  Yeah I want to read  First of all  I want to emphasize  Anthony  You are completely correct  With all your info  As usual  Thank you sir  The Geneva Convention  Okay first of all  I can tell  When these clowns  Get on there  And try to go  Head to head with you 
[03:41:00]  I can tell  Just by the way  They talk  They have never  Worn the uniform  They have never  Sacrificed their body  Their mental soul  Or anything  Nothing  Except for  Oh maybe a little  Cock in the ass  But anyway  The Geneva Convention  You're correct  It applies only  To soldiers  And soldiers in combat  And when you take  Soldiers as prisoners  Of war  Terrorists  Do not  Get that luxury  Of the Geneva Convention  No 
[03:41:30]  They are threats  To the national security  Therefore  When you have them  In custody  You have to use  Any means necessary  To get information  To protect this country  Now quite frankly  Waterboarding  Is  Nothing  Compared to what  They do over there  Strapping batteries  To battery springs  And tying it to it  Hooking battery cables  To your ears  Heating up  Hot tools  And burning you  Sticking drills in you 
[03:42:00]  Things like that  That is what  Is called  Savage  Terrorist  Tactics  To get information  Yeah that's torture  Waterboarding is minute  Other things that we use  You know you eject them  In a little bit of  True serum  Slap them around  A little bit  You know you get  The information you need  And there has been  Plenty of information  That has been  Obtained  From waterboarding  Finding terrorist  Camps  Training areas  Things like that  And these clowns  They have no idea  And you know  You're right  Anthony  I agree with you  I consider 
[03:42:30]  Obama  He's a traitor  For doing that  Wanting to stop  Black off operations  And you know  CIA waterboarding  Tactics  We have to have that  To protect this country  Let me say  Look  Traitor  Is  I said traitor  Of course he's not  It's just  It's such an  Irritating quality  To go after guys  Who are doing  What has to be done  To people that  Really do need  To have it done to them  You know what I mean  To me  If you're the president  You're doing that  It's disgraceful 
[03:43:00]  By the way  Anthony  Did you get your book  A couple years ago  That I left  I gave to  Kenny  At one of Jimmy's shows  In Dallas  Say yes  He's a Green Beret  Yes  It was  It was a book  It was called  The Nazis  There was a really  Neat picture in there  Of the guy smiling  Doing the dirty deed  I gave it to Kenny  I don't know if he got it  I just wanted to make sure  I think Kenny  Aided on the plane  I love listening to you guys  Every single morning  And my load today 
[03:43:30]  And my big truck  That I'm hauling  I have electronic items  For the general public  Hey Paul  You like the show  What do you like about the show?

[03:44:00]  He's very  That'd be fun  Pete's  Look  I don't agree with him  But he's very  Out with his opinion  He speaks his mind  He'd be a very interesting guy  To have on I think  And then he likes to kiss other men  So I think we would all enjoy each other  At the end  Oh interesting  If things go bad  We can make up  With a good blow job  I'd say a little less of that  On this show  It would be nice  I disagree  Can we get a  Biggums magazine for tomorrow  That's all I want to look at now  Did you find any  Biggums website Danny?  Well I don't think it's a real  I mean it wasn't 
[03:44:30]  I think you're thinking of Biggums  Which was Al Bundy's favorite magazine  On Married with Children  No there's an actual  Me and my brother were checking it out  Maybe I'm getting the name a little wrong  Biggums?
