<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts' typical crude banter, including sexually explicit jokes, references to bodily functions, and racial slurs.  Comedian Bill Burr was a guest at the beginning of the show.  Opie recounted his disastrous Atlantic City gambling trip, detailing his losses at three-card poker and roulette, and mocking other gamblers.  The conversation then shifted to a satirical discussion of Hurricane Rita, contrasting the media's coverage with that of Hurricane Katrina and mocking the perceived overreaction to Rita's minimal damage and the lack of celebrity involvement in relief efforts.  They also covered various sports topics, focusing on their NFL teams and joking about injured players, particularly the Philadelphia Eagles' kicker.  The hosts reviewed listener-submitted videos of a "date" between "Stalker Patty" and "Big A," and responded to several listener calls, ranging from discussions of Hurricane Rita's impact to criticisms of Opie's on-air personality.  A heated exchange with a listener named “Sniper” ensued.  Dr. J also called in to criticize Opie's role in the show's dynamic.

The show continued with discussion of the “Churchofopie.org” fan website, deemed “creepy” and “disturbing.”  A significant segment focused on Steve, a caller detailing numerous defects in his new condo using extensive profanity.  The hosts and other callers offered humorous commentary and suggestions.  Further calls covered topics such as a *Family Guy* episode referencing Opie and Howard Stern, Anthony's moth infestation, a listener's bug-infested cereal, and Oliver Stone's *Alexander*, focusing on its perceived homoerotic subtext.  Steve, a regular contributor, was in the studio for a portion of this segment.  The segment concluded with a review of listener-submitted movie trailers critiqued by Steve and the hosts.

The next segment heavily featured the review of more listener-submitted, poorly produced movie trailers.  Audio issues, blamed on an intern named Ray, hampered the reviews.  Listeners called in to confirm the audio problems.  Trailers reviewed included "Stinks" (by Das Burchin), several unnamed submissions, and trailers by Rick and Phoenix and Carmine from the Bronx.  The hosts discussed the varying production quality of these trailers and the differing skill levels of the submitters. All movie trailers were to be sent to Steve at foundrymusic.com.  The hosts also ranked candy bars from best to worst, expressing particular disdain for Take Five, Zagnut, and Mounds bars.  They briefly discussed celebrity news, including calls from Tara Reid, and commentary on Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher's relationship and Barbra Streisand.  Jimmy Norton was mentioned as a co-host,  Samuel L. Jackson's voice was referenced in a trailer, and Bill Burr was again mentioned, first as a former guest and later compared to a background extra.  The segment ended abruptly mid-discussion of listener-submitted content.

The final segment focused on age gaps in relationships, spurred by Rafe Fiennes's relationship with a significantly older woman.  Discussions included speculation on Fiennes's sexuality and comparisons of the attractiveness of older women (Jane Seymour, Demi Moore, Goldie Hawn).  Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher's marriage and Bruce Willis's reaction were also discussed. A caller claimed older women were superior dating partners.  Jimmy Norton called in from Los Angeles, discussing his apartment hunt, health issues (possible strep throat), acting anxieties, and experiences with questionable neighborhoods, a potential "donkey sausage" incident, L.A. hookers, and a bad massage.  E-Rock also called in, discussing his $100,000 win and his purchase of Ikea furniture, which the hosts ridiculed.  E-Rock also presented a *Scream* movie trailer remix featuring Andrew Dice Clay. A listener criticized E-Rock's furniture choice, leading to a discussion of the hosts' own living situations. The show concluded with Big A singing “Brother Joe’s Cunt Song,” noted for his "speech impediment," followed by listener calls summarizing their takeaways from the broadcast, ranging from humorous observations to personal anecdotes.  An ongoing Opie and Anthony auction and several Taser videos were mentioned.

[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  This show is a disaster.  This show is a disaster.  If you have any poo, fling it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  You can act like a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous. 
[00:04:30]  He was banging cocktail wages and two at a time.  I say, I say, anybody listen to Howard Stern this morning.  He had some strippers in the studio.  They sounded hot.  Then he made a joke about a Negro.  But Robert laughed, so it was okay.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Yeah.  That's funny. 
[00:05:00]  I'm funny.  And that's how we begin another week of broadcasting on XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:05:30]  Hi.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  With Bill Burr.  What's going on?  A featured player.  I like it. 
[00:06:00]  We get occurring.  Like Oliver on the Brady Bunch.  Yeah.  How's everyone doing?  You make it through the weekend.  You make it through Rita.  You make it through the Rita coverage.  I was kind of bummed because I was with the Hurricane Rita pregame show for five days.  Yeah.  Five fucking days.  And then I took off for the weekend.  I went to Atlantic City on Friday night and played three-card poker.  And I had to email Anthony immediately because some schmuck right next to me gets a straight flush. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  On a $50 bet.  You sit there long enough it happens to you.  You sit there long enough it happens to you.  Forty to one odds.  So you're talking a $2,000 hand basically.  It's a nice payout.  $2,000 on one fucking hand.  I end up losing $200 but had a good time.  No big deal.  You got to...  I don't gamble like Anthony.  I don't go nuts.  You got to sit there.  If you sit there at that three-card poker table long enough, you'll hit one of the big hands.  You just got to have enough in your bankroll to keep your ass in the seat long enough. 
[00:07:00]  And then before you know it, you got three of a kind.  You get a straight flush.  Something happens for you.  And you're making big money.  I'm done with three-card poker.  Are you?  It's all about let it ride.  What?  You've been playing let it ride?  Let it ride.  Dave.  Yeah.  The real gamers hate that game.  I was going to say that just sounds like a game for losers.  Like there's no strategy.  No.  They call that one of the sucker games down there. 
[00:07:30]  But somebody's got to win.  Yeah.  Let it ride.  Let it ride, baby.  You want to take that with you or let it ride?  Let it ride.  Oh!  That's what you hear a lot.  I'm going to go play what do you say, big shot.  You hear a lot of excitement.  And then, uh, then, uh, oh!  That's the dumbest game down there.  Let it ride.  Let it ride.  Like you're feeling like a high roller. 
[00:08:00]  That's it.  You're a high roller.  I'm one of the big shots here, pally.  I'm playing let it ride.  I'm going to get comped at the buffet.  So.  They'll fly anybody in.  They fly my friends in.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  They got credit card companies calling them every fucking day.  Oh, shit.  They get, yo, Bally's hooks us up.  Yeah.  No, you're hooking Bally's up.  Yeah, of course.  Believe me.  You're.  They're not taking anything out of their pocket for you.  You're making a great point because we all have friends and stuff that, hey, dude, 
[00:08:30]  uh, I'm, I'm being flown to Vegas and I got a suite and.  Yeah.  They're hooking me up.  No, they know you're a big time sucker.  Yeah.  They get your own sucker, uh, gold card that they give you.  Right.  Yeah.  Overall, you're never a winner.  You're never, ever.  There's not one person overall that's a winner.  It doesn't work that way.  You could go on one trip and, and leave ahead from the time you went.  But unless you go to Atlantic City once or any of the Vegas or Mohegan one time win and 
[00:09:00]  never go back again, you give it back.  Play for 20 minutes.  Yeah.  Play for 20 minutes, win, get back on the bus, get back on the jitney and leave.  Uh, you, you, you, you always give it back.  Yeah.  You're never ahead in your gambling winnings.  It just doesn't work.  I also realized the worst time to be recognized for being Opie from the Opie and Anthony program  is when you're losing money.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's me, but shut up.  I'm trying to win some money back here. 
[00:09:30]  Hey, what's the matter?  What's the matter?  You having a run of bad cards?  Yeah.  Fuck you, ass.  Come on, Opie, let it ride.  Let it ride.  I'm one of those assholes.  I play, I play roulette.  Yeah.  And I stand there with all my chips and I just watch the trees and I wait for like, you  know, five reds in a row and I just put it all on black and that'll hit once.  And then I just scoop them off.  Oh, really?  And they walk away.  You're that guy.  I love it.  Like a fucking old lady. 
[00:10:00]  I really actually, after a while, think I can see it.  Yeah.  I can feel it.  I can feel it.  I know when it's coming.  Use the force.  It just seems so easy.  It seems like it's like 50-50.  And then you just got those couple of greens in there.  The greens just throw you off.  Yeah.  Takes the 50-50 right out of it.  Green.  You know, they got mathematicians like these guys who can like figure out, like they have  like a theory to figure out how much liquid is in a cylinder.  They have like that kind of mathematical knowledge rigging these games.  And you're sitting there, well, you know, okay. 
[00:10:30]  Red, black, kind of 50-50.  It's a coin toss.  A couple of greens.  It's like what?  Forty-eight percent?  It's a coin toss if sometimes the coin lands on the edge.  Yeah.  That's pretty much it.  Sometimes this fucker's going to land on the edge.  You're not going to get heads or tails, you idiot.  But the point I'm making is I decided to take off for the weekend.  And so I was behind in my Hurricane Rita coverage.  Yes.  Because I was following that around the clock 24-7.  Who wasn't?  With all these fine news channels we got.  And so I wake up Saturday morning and I actually ran out to my car because I didn't have access to TV really to turn on XM to see what was going on. 
[00:11:00]  And within five minutes Saturday morning I knew this storm was a bust.  Yeah.  This storm was a bust.  Nothing.  I know some coastal towns got destroyed and stuff.  But those people know what they're in for when they're living down there.  That's not like you have a house inland or something and because of a levee breaking, you know. 
[00:11:30]  Right.  It gets flooded.  They knew.  You know, their houses were on stilts.  Well, they haven't.  Built on stilts.  You know, and it's sad for those people, obviously.  But let's face it.  The news doesn't give a shit as much as they did for Hurricane Katrina.  Where's the around-the-clock coverage, post-storm coverage?  Where's the boats?  I don't see any front-page headlines here about Hurricane Rita.  It wasn't.  You can't see Sean Penn in the boat.  Right.  The reality is it wasn't big enough.  Yeah, where's Sean?  Where was Sean Penn in his little boat with his shotgun?  I was starting to think the news crews cared about humanity.  But now I've got to go back to they don't really give a shit. 
[00:12:00]  Opie, don't stop now.  They don't give a shit.  They're people that-  They care.  Sean Penn could have rescued everyone from this last hurricane in his boat.  Yeah.  It's like six people.  There's nothing happening.  More people died evacuating than died in the hurricane.  Yeah, in that bus.  More people died on that one bus with the old people and the oxygen.  Yeah, you're correct, Bill.  The old people.  But in the post, they have a before and after shot, and there's not one house left in this  one coastal, like, I don't know, little island. 
[00:12:30]  There's a strip of beach.  It's a peninsula, I believe.  A little peninsula.  It's around it on three sides by water.  Was it a peninsula?  Yes.  Yeah, let's call it a peninsula.  And not one house.  No.  Not even the hint that a house was there.  No remains of a house.  The stilts.  And that's because all those houses, they know when they're building down there, they can't  have basements or any of that crap, and they're pretty much just setting their houses on the  ground.  Knowing that if a hurricane hits them directly, they're screwed.  Yeah, but until the hurricane hits, they got some great waterfront property, and they're-  That's their-  That really is true.  They're rocking. 
[00:13:00]  That's their green on the wheel.  If you go out to your front yard with, like, a little kitty pail in that little scoop and  just, like, dig down about six inches, you're already hitting seawater.  Yeah.  You got water coming.  You pretty much know if you get a hurricane, you're screwed.  You're screwed.  And a lot of people were affected by this hurricane, but you're just not going to see the coverage  today, like you did with Hurricane Katrina.  Opie, the sequel, not as good as the first one.  Not as good.  We were talking about hurricane sequels on, what, Thursday or Friday last week?  Yeah.  Yeah, this sequel blows.  Absolutely blows.  And now it's a nightmare going back into Houston. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, all those people that evacuated Houston and Galveston and both of those cities just  got brushed by the hurricane.  They left for nothing, for no reason.  Fear.  Now, you're going to be hard-pressed to get people out of these cities again, or out of  any other city.  This girl was saying to me, like, yeah, they're saying that maybe, like, in Houston, some of  those skyscrapers could come down.  Yeah.  I'm like, they're not coming down.  The skyscrapers can fall.  No, they won't.  Well, that was the fear that the TV gave us.  Yeah, the news.  But don't, when they build them, they have to be able to withstand hurricane force winds 
[00:14:00]  and then some so they don't fall down?  They're not going to fall down.  And they're begging everyone not to return to Houston all at the same time.  Who's going to be the guy that's like, yeah, all right, I'll wait.  I'll wait.  Fuck that.  Everyone's jumping in their cars immediately and getting back as fast as possible.  I like those people that sit in the movie theater for everybody to leave before they  get up and go.  You know, you see them sitting there, the movie's over, the credits are rolling.  They're the people that'll wait.  And there's usually maybe two or three of them in the theater. 
[00:14:30]  Everyone else gets up and crowds the aisles.  That's because there was some obscure song in the movie and you've got to wait to see  who did it.  So you can just go.  Who is that?  Oh.  Oh, Lou Reed.  And then by the time you went to your car, you forgot.  Oh, I hate when you get up too.  While you sat there for 10 minutes.  And they start huffing and puffing like, oh.  Yeah.  They're walking by because they want to know who the fifth lead was.  You know what I do?  Is this filmed in Panavision?  I've got to wait for the end now.  When they huff and puff.  Special thanks to everybody from Cincinnati.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When they huff and puff, I turn around and go, it's just words. 
[00:15:00]  It's just words, you.  There's no pictures up there.  Or some dumb, you know, actor.  And you're like, how do I know him?  You ever see the movies, though?  The credits end and then they come back on and do a little something.  Oh, a little Ferris Bueller?  Yeah, a little Ferris Bueller action.  There's been a couple of movies where they do that.  The credits are all over.  And then, boom, you see a little part of the movie that everyone would have missed.  But you can kind of see that. 
[00:15:30]  If you're seeing like a period piece, you know, get the fuck out of the movie theater.  I think that Night of the Living Dead, the sequel, Dawn of the Dead, or Day of the Dead,  or one of those dead that they did before the last dead they did, the one with Ving Rhames.  The dead one they did in the mall.  The end of that one, a lot of people were leaving.  And the things they were flashing on the credits is the end of the movie.  Like, you would think the movie ended with them going to this island and everything's hunky-dory  and, you know, we'll wait until the next movie.  You don't realize everyone dies. 
[00:16:00]  They all get killed.  You wouldn't know that unless you sat through the credits.  And for those of you that waited for On Demand, you were going to catch it this week,  you should have seen it sooner.  I like movies like that.  Everyone's dead.  Yeah, I like everyone's die movie.  What do we got on Hurricane Rita?  Anything?  Dead.  What are the headlines?  There really aren't any.  You know, no one cares.  No one cares.  Some flooding.  That's about it.  They showed, like, one inch of water over huge areas.  Like, a big parking lot was their big thing.  They would be in front of a parking lot at a church and go, look at the flooding. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, you get that here during a big storm.  They showed a picture of a mailbox today on the news.  Yeah, unless it was 18 feet high.  The mailbox really didn't look that flooded.  No, it looks like the mailman could still deliver the mail.  Of course he could.  Thank God.  There are trucks driving on the roads.  They're showing that.  An announcement to the people that were affected by Hurricane Rita.  You are not getting your benefit concert.  I'm sorry.  Nope.  No charities.  You're just not getting that concert today.  No eBay.  You won't be seeing any Opie and Anthony memorabilia in your name going up on eBay. 
[00:17:00]  It wasn't important enough for Sean Penn to get a fucking rowboat.  I'm sorry.  I didn't see one helicopter dropping a harness down to pick up a family.  John Travolta won't be putting his one hand on your shoulder.  No.  No one from Galveston or Houston is getting John Travolta's hand on their shoulder.  They're going to get, like, the sea level stars.  Right, right.  Kathy Griffin's going to show up.  Right.  That's funny.  Oh, they've been through enough.  Help you mop your driveway. 
[00:17:30]  They have been through enough.  I want to be with you on this, and I can't even think of another sea level celebrity.  Yeah, you go, that guy on that 70s show.  Yeah, I was running through sitcoms real fast, like, I couldn't even think of one.  Not one.  Screech is helping you rebuild.  There you go.  There's a hack one to throw out there.  So no Celine Dion crying.  Take a kayak.  A kayak.  No.  She's not going to be yelling and screaming that people should touch things because they're  too poor to have these things in real life.  You're getting Kim Carnes. 
[00:18:00]  All right, I'll go with Kim Carnes.  Sure, why not?  That's another thing.  You don't get to loot after this one?  No.  It's not a devastating storm unless there was looting.  There's no looting.  The store owner's sitting there sweeping.  Like, everything's fine.  No one left.  He's still there in front of his little shop.  There's no looting.  I know.  You saw, like, all dead bodies in, like, New Orleans.  This one, there's, like, some guy in a hammock who, ah, shit, his ass got a little wet.  He, like, slept through the whole storm.  Yeah, his bloated dead bodies floating down the streets of New Orleans. 
[00:18:30]  But this one, ah, kind of anticlimactic.  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  And I knew right away.  But they had to still go with that coverage around the clock over the weekend.  And they just really didn't have anything.  Mm-hmm.  Did Geraldo Rivera, like, push someone out of the way to get him on a helicopter or something?  Really?  I don't know.  I was reading something in the paper today, but he's denying it.  Like, he pushed the National Guard away because they were doing a shot for TV.  Does anyone know anything further about this? 
[00:19:00]  That he wanted him out of the shot?  No, supposedly, I guess, ah, I don't know.  Give me the post there.  Is it in the post?  Yeah, so it's got to be true, right?  Where half the fucking front page of these newspapers are their scratch and win games.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  The Daily News I watched, I looked at yesterday, the Sunday Daily News, half of the front page  was their big news was their scratch game.  And now, ah, the New York Post.  Half the front page is, ah, their new card game inside. 
[00:19:30]  Post Poker.  One million dollars scratch and win.  I love when they put the N there.  Scratch and win.  Gives it some real credibility on the cover of their paper.  Oh, it might be in the back.  I love the names of those, like, set for life hours.  Like, that's just like you have no game plan.  You're going to win this, you're going to be set for life.  Dude, I'm all set.  I got a dollar now. 
[00:20:00]  I got 90 billion to one chance.  Telling you, you guys are laughing at me.  Set for life.  Everyone else is, like, going to college.  He's got a buck.  Yeah, you go to college, you got, like, a, you know, you got an 80% chance of doing all right.  This guy's playing a one in a billion.  Yeah, the guy going to college is like, I'm going to get an education.  I'm becoming a doctor.  I'll be set for life.  This guy, hey, you could just buy a card behind the register. 
[00:20:30]  Got the same chance, set for life.  Getting back to the Geraldo thing real fast.  They're saying now there is no evidence that the Fox News Channel reporter had nudged an Air Force rescuer out of the way to get on TV helping a wheelchair-bound woman onto a rescue flight.  As Stanley claimed in a column about Hurricane Katrina coverage.  He is just awful.  Geraldo.  Well, I remember driving down to Atlantic City, and they had a report from Geraldo Rivera, and he said that he's just staying put. 
[00:21:00]  And I'm like, and I was thinking, oh, my God, Geraldo Rivera is going to die because he's stupid.  No, unfortunately, things don't work that way.  A busload of elderly will go up, but Geraldo will continue.  All right, let's say hi to Charlie.  Hey, Charlie, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hi, Jimmy's replacement.  What's going on?  That story with Geraldo.  What happened was a Times reporter, she's a TV critic or something, wrote that she was watching coverage of Fox News during Katrina, 
[00:21:30]  and she saw Geraldo push some guy from the military out of the way or nudge him, as she wrote, to help some woman down a flight of stairs in a wheelchair.  And Fox showed the videotape several times, and there's been a tape, however, as far as Geraldo pushing anybody out of the way.  No, he didn't.  So, of course, Fox demanded an apology from the New York Times, and the New York Times refused. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, really?  So, that's basically the story, and there was a follow-up written in an editorial yesterday from somebody else who was basically saying the New York Times was wrong, and it was in the New York Times.  Well, the Times and Fox News are polar opposites.  That's it.  All right, Charlie, thank you.  Punch it out.  All right.  So, there's not really anything to that.  No.  All right.  I'll just acknowledge right off the bat, my jets suck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Now you've got some injuries. 
[00:22:30]  Idiot.  You idiot.  Idiot.  Yeah, they lost to Jacksonville 26-20 in overtime.  And now what are you going to do?  What?  And now what are you going to do?  Your quarterback is injured?  Well, I like the Bills.  Very injured.  Oh, you're just switching teams?  That's handy.  I like the Bills.  Yeah.  Me and my brother were Jets fans and Bills fans because...  Yeah.  How?  Well, we both spent a lot of time in Western New York going to college and I started my  radio career up there.  So, I have this weird thing. 
[00:23:00]  I follow the Bills and the Jets.  I know.  It sounds ridiculous.  And for the people in the rest of the country...  But it's good.  As soon as one team starts sucking, you can jump on the other bandwagon.  Just because Bills are in Buffalo and Buffalo's in New York, it absolutely does not mean  that if you're from New York, you're a Buffalo fan.  Oh, of course not.  Like, people in New York City don't even consider Buffalo, the Bills, like a New York team.  They don't even acknowledge it.  Yeah.  You would think that would be a New York team.  We don't even acknowledge that Buffalo's part of New York.  I know. 
[00:23:30]  That's Canada.  Right.  It's some kind of entity unto itself.  It's Southern Canada.  Yeah.  I always hated the people who were way out there and they would be like Yankee fans back  before the Red Sox won it.  I'd be like, dude, Cleveland is like fucking 40 miles away from you.  You're an Indians fan, but they suck.  Yeah.  I was doing like the Yankees dynasty, like everybody, all these transplants, all these  comedians I knew, they were like from Pittsburgh and Florida.  Dude, I was always a big Yankee fan.  Really?  Talk about them in the 80s.  Name one fucking player. 
[00:24:00]  Exactly.  By the way, the Bills lost to the Falcons 24 to 16.  Oops.  So now I'm going to be following the Patriots because-  Well, if you go with the Patriots.  Well, because Anthony and I, we did three years of radio in Boston, so I have a little-  Oh, that gives you a little clout.  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  He's done the whole AFC East.  Yeah, so I'm going to be really-  Who's left?  Miami's next.  You guys get fired up here.  Well, I was down in Miami once, so drove through once.  Went to the beach there. 
[00:24:30]  Patriots beat the Steelers 23 to 20, and Brady had just another amazing fucking game.  Yeah, Ben.  My quarterback, Chad Pennington, he threw for 76 yards.  Ben, how many yards did Tom Brady have yesterday?  300 and something.  370, I think.  Wow.  He had a good game.  Yeah, great.  He even had an interception, but they still won.  He'll be at Daisy's drinking, and Chad will be in an MRI fucking tube.  The best is they bring Fiedler, and then what, he went for three plays?  And then he got hurt. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, they couldn't keep the-  Then some, I guess, linemen started throwing.  I don't know.  Fuck.  Hey, Philadelphia, how's your kicking game?  Yeah, what happened?  The kicker got hurt, and they had to put, like, linemen in kicking.  It was hilarious.  I only saw the highlights of it, but trying to kick a field goal, yeah, the ball went like  three feet.  See, I got to see this footage.  Ben told me about this when we got in today, and supposedly their kicker got hurt, so-  This is true.  His hamstring.  Yeah.  The best guy they could find was a lineman.  I don't know what he was.  Where's your backup guy? 
[00:25:30]  He's probably kicking it straight on like George Blanda.  He's got, like, the old John Unitas high tops.  It was hysterical.  Yeah, but he was, like, this huge guy trying to kick a field goal, and the ball went nowhere.  And then they had him kick off.  They had another guy kick off.  Oh, no.  So the kicker came in and won the game for him, but whatever he did, he fucked his whole  leg up at the end of the game, because he just went down right after he made the game  win again.  So someone else had to try to kick a field goal and went nowhere.  And then another guy kicked off, and it went 10 yards or something like that. 
[00:26:00]  That was a good game.  I think you didn't have a backup guy.  It was funny.  A backup kicker?  Yeah, you don't have one.  They don't even consider the kicker as part of the team.  That's why they was kind of laughing that he was hurt.  Like, it was his plant leg where, like, his hamstring was fucked up.  So he kicked the game one and one, and then he just went down wincing, holding his back  leg like it was like this, you know, Vietnam War movie.  And they're like, ah, get up, you pussy.  Get up.  Who cares about you?  Even when he winced in pain, he didn't look like a warrior.  He just looked like some pussy, like, ah. 
[00:26:30]  Nothing's better than when something fucks up and the kicker's got to pick the ball up  and either run or try to throw it or something with these moose just coming after him.  He's wearing, like, those slippers.  Yeah.  He's got the slippers.  His one little bar in front of his face.  He goes back to being the pussy that he was in grammar school, you know?  He tries to throw it.  He lifts his arm up and it flies behind him.  Yeah.  Or goes end over end.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah. 
[00:27:00]  Those are wonderful moments.  Those guys still have to work for pussy.  That's the funniest thing.  Yeah.  You're like, you could have a Super Bowl ring.  Yeah.  You're just sitting there all, like, sheepy.  You're still stuck.  Sheepy.  Ah, the Dolphins look good.  Yes, they beat Carolina 27 to 24.  The amazing one is San Francisco almost beat Dallas.  They came back.  They were getting killed the whole game.  Yeah, Dallas was – that's right.  Oh, that's right.  Wow.  Dallas won, but I don't know how.  Dallas 34, San Francisco 31, and then another great game for the Giants there. 
[00:27:30]  Wow.  San Diego 45, Giants 23.  Holy shit.  Oh, they suck.  He's just like his brother.  He actually had a pretty good game, though.  He had a pretty good game.  They just got smoked.  San Diego's a good team.  He's actually developing as a pretty good quarterback.  And look at Green – has Green Bay won a game this year?  Does anyone know?  I really – I think they're 0-3.  I'm not following Green Bay this year.  Yeah, poor Brett Favre.  I think he's done.  HEPA Bay 17, Green Bay 17.  Are they 0-3?  He's done.  Green Bay.  Wow.  Look at that.  Who would have thought that? 
[00:28:00]  All right, well.  But the Philly, the Philly kicker.  We've got to find the footage of that.  It was unbelievable.  Yeah, you've got to see that.  Got to check that out.  All right, why don't we take our first break, do some dangs, and then we'll come back and talk  about – I don't know.  I guess we could talk about Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher.  Oh.  Secret marriage.  Secret marriage.  Secret.  And then –  And we could talk about breast cancer.  What's her – what's his name there?  Her ex-husband there?  Bruce Willis?  Bruce Willis?  He was at the wedding.  I don't know.  Let's get into it next.  How's that sound? 
[00:28:30]  How that works.  I don't know how that works.  He must have dumped her.  Yeah.  That's the only way I could show up.  How the hell do you show up to that?  There's too many men.  Too many people making too many problems.  And there's not much love to go around.  Can't you see this is a land of confusion?  This is the world we live in.  And these are the hands we're given. 
[00:29:00]  Use them and let's start trying to make it a place worth living in.  Nice.  That's Disturbed doing Land of Confusion, the old Genesis song.  We're back with the O.B. and Anthony program.  So you want to talk about Stalker Patty and Big A real fast?  Yeah, the videos are up on foundrymusic.com.  They had their big date last week.  We talked about it on, I guess, Friday. 
[00:29:30]  And now the videos are all up for your viewing pleasure.  Yes, there's five video clips of Nathaniel interviewing them in the cab.  And their little cab ride there to Little Italy.  Then them walking down the street.  Big A playing the dart game to try to win Patty some prizes.  And just, he is so horrid.  He is so, you see the faces he was making, Nathaniel, when he was throwing the darts.  And he'd hit two out of three, so he couldn't win the big prize. 
[00:30:00]  And his face, the disappointment and anger in his face when he couldn't win for his sweetheart is priceless.  You just got to download these.  He has definitely a big level of rage that he hasn't tapped into.  When you guys were talking about his breath, did you see his forehead when his eyes started?  Yeah, his eyebrows went down like very angry.  His face got, yeah, like he wanted to kill us. 
[00:30:30]  But he hasn't really tapped into that yet.  That's why I kept trying to say something like reinforcing or positive to him.  Because, yeah, that's how it's played.  That's how the game is played.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, rip apart, rip apart.  Build up.  Right before the brink.  Let him down.  Let some air out.  Open up the check valve.  Let off some steam.  Close it.  Build it up.  It'll stoke the furnace.  And then kablammy.  Yeah.  Hopefully it explodes in someone else's face. 
[00:31:00]  So the videos are pretty disturbing.  Yeah, yeah.  And the Ferris wheel is just, oh.  Well, there's some Ferris wheel.  It just looked like the, first of all, who's going on a Ferris wheel at the San Gennaro?  That thing looked like a hazard.  Just looked like it was waiting to cut someone in half.  And they go to get on it.  Him and Patty sit in the seat.  And then the guy that runs it comes up.  And you couldn't hear it, but you can see the guy leans over to Big A and says something. 
[00:31:30]  And Big A gets out of the seat.  And then they put the bar across Patty.  And you hear one, I think it was Danny or Nathaniel, asking, what happened?  And Big A goes, um, too big.  The guy, they were already seated in it, ready to close up the little safety bar.  And, uh, the guy told, uh, uh, Big A, you gotta, you gotta leave.  Yeah.  Too, too, too, big. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  Too big.  Well, check out the videos for yourself on opiananthony.com and foundrymusic.com.  Yeah.  Before we move on to other things, we got audio coming in about, uh, Hurricane Rita and the effects.  Ooh.  I guess.  It's just, uh, a quick little piece from Good Morning America.  It's a major issue across the country.  In Lexington, Kentucky, rising gas prices have forced a number of school districts to move to a four-day week.  And in one district, they're already saving nearly $300,000.  In South Carolina, an entire county government will go four-day, ten hours a day, starting October 1st. 
[00:32:30]  Oconee County says it budgeted for $2.50 a gallon and not a cent higher.  Now we're experiencing $3 a gallon.  So that 50 cents, uh, makes a lot of difference when you add several thousand gallons of, uh, fuel per year.  There is some concern the governor of Georgia may have helped cause the panic he is trying to prevent.  For this state's schoolchildren, today is definitely Christmas in September. 
[00:33:00]  Charlie.  How cool is that?  Four-day, uh, school.  Oh, wow, there it is.  Big A.  Look at that rage.  Wow, he does get the rage after he misses with the dark.  Oh, yeah, he'd just squeeze you to death.  He'd, like, break you like a toy.  Yeah.  His eyes go up into his head slightly.  That's the look he gives.  But anyway, you hear that, Ant?  Yeah.  They're only going to school for four days a week because of the gas prices. 
[00:33:30]  Saves money.  But if you're a kid, you don't give a fuck.  You got a day off, also.  That rules.  But the stupid, you know, the stupid teachers make up for it always.  Mm-hmm.  They work you a little harder in the classroom.  More homework.  More homework.  Yeah, I'm sure when you're not in on that Friday, if it's a Friday that they're taking  off, if you're not in that one day a week, they just load you up with so much homework  that it would take you a full school day to complete it anyway at home.  Yeah.  It was never fun.  Oh, yeah.  One of those asshole teachers.  Yeah.  We're still going to stay on schedule. 
[00:34:00]  Right.  You're still going to do the work that I have figured out.  Their little program they put together at the beginning of the year.  You start going on pace like those Japanese kids over there.  You get to have, like, 15 hours a day.  Yeah.  Sing the school song, Crying.  To show that you really love it.  Calisthenics.  You ever see that on 60 Minutes?  These fucking guys are working in, like, a company, like a Fortune 500 company, and,  you know, they didn't work their, you know, nine zillion hours for the week, so they lost  face.  Right.  And their whole family just, like, abandons them, and they send them to this boot camp. 
[00:34:30]  But at one point, you have to go in front of the board of directors and sing the company  song.  And these guys, you got to, like, show, they, like, cry.  Yeah.  Like, you're in your underwear, and the whole board of directors is just staring at you, like,  like, fucking Mount Rushmore.  In your underwear.  And if you don't cry enough, if they don't believe it.  Yeah.  That's it. 
[00:35:00]  And then they just look, and they're just like, nah.  You're not selling it.  You're not.  And your career is fucking over.  And then there's no support system.  The family, you lost face.  Yeah.  They turned that entire, like, samurai battle, all for the emperor thing into commercialism,  into work.  Like, that's the same dedication the soldiers had to the emperor.  That's some deep-seated shit. 
[00:35:30]  That's why their eyes are like that.  It's stress.  Just, just, oh.  Yeah.  It's a good work.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's from migraine headaches.  Oh.  Look at all the work that they have to do.  I got to do this for an hour?  Oh.  I.  I.  Yeah.  That was it.  All for the emperor.  And now it's all for, you know, the company they work for.  It's the same dedication that they had for their country.  As far as my little knowledge over there, I think the Japanese, they're like the white 
[00:36:00]  people of the Asians.  Yeah.  And, like, they stole from, like, the Chinese.  Right.  And they said they're a bunch of animals.  That's why in that Bruce Lee movie, he said he kicks the shit out of that shogun warrior.  Yeah.  And then when he, after he kicks the shit out of him, he goes, and by the way, I am not  an animal.  And when they had it in China, the whole place was like, wah.  Yeah.  He did, like, the wave.  Yeah.  Ah.  All right.  We got more audio from Hurricane Rita. 
[00:36:30]  It's the weather montage.  Oh.  When a hurricane comes through, man, you got to have the hurricane montage.  It's a montage.  Of all the people in the eye of the storm, the reporters.  The rain is being dropped all over.  She is so big.  She's so widespread.  When she makes landfall, it's going to be a couple hours.  It's going to get worse.  Oh, that's Greta.  Her face probably didn't move with all that wind.  With the facelift she's got.  What the hell?  You probably couldn't tell that she was in the middle of a hurricane. 
[00:37:00]  No.  Her face is so tight.  It just looks like she's constantly being hit by 100-mile-an-hour winds.  She probably never had a facelift.  That's just from standing in 180-mile winds.  I'm here.  It's a hurricane.  It's going to get worse.  Yeah, I know it is.  The inside of this hotel now looks like the outside of this hurricane.  What?  It's 5 o'clock in the morning. 
[00:37:30]  This is the closest that the center of circulation has come to us here in Beaumont.  The wind is howling.  The rain is horizontal.  The signage is out and the windows have blown out.  I can see the rain.  The rain is large.  Guys, I can't hear you, but if you can hear me and see me, it's thanks a large bar to our satellite truck operator.  That looks like it's impossible to stand in.  Yeah, you're doing it. 
[00:38:00]  I'm sorry.  Are you talking to me?  You're talking to me.  We're still at the height of three to howling winds.  Debris litters the streets.  But what's dangerous now is the water is rapidly rising behind us.  Rain comes with rain.  In this case.  And I don't know if you can see it, but it's literally this wall.  It is like a solid mass, and it'll just whip you up and blow you away. 
[00:38:30]  I don't know if you can see, but it's raining out, and things are getting wet.  It's windy here in the hurricane.  They just stand there in the wind, and it's really not that big a deal.  I'd recomb my hair, but that's futile at this point.  It's like, what are you doing?  They find the worst place they could stand, is what they do, next to a building,  so maybe the air is funneling a certain way out in an open parking lot,  so they get in the brunt of it.  And still, they are indeed standing there. 
[00:39:00]  Right.  It's not blowing them off their feet.  It's windy, sure.  It's a hurricane.  But it's not nearly as horrid and dangerous as they're trying to make it sound.  The windows are blown out of this building.  You think right before they went to it live, they broke those windows?  You know?  Push!  Like we were talking about golfers.  You know, just push a car into a swimming pool or something.  Yeah.  To get the impressive shots.  Even that montage just didn't sound as impressive as the montage from Hurricane Katrina. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  New Orleans doesn't exist anymore.  I mean, to top that?  That's the big story.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  You can't.  Yeah.  You can't top New Orleans unless another one, even that wouldn't top it, if another  one came into New Orleans, because everyone's gone.  That was the big one.  That's it.  But the news, they want to try to keep it going.  This was the second killer storm.  Oh, my God.  Here we are.  That's not as big.  Dr. J, what's up?  What's up, Mr. Awesome or Mr. That's Classic? 
[00:40:00]  You know my drift here, Opie?  Is that every time that Bill or Anthony or Anthony and Jim have a great riff going on  a topic and you can't contribute because you have nothing witty to say, right in the  middle of it, you'll just fucking just say, oh, that's awesome.  That's classic.  Let's go back to Katrina.  Let's go back to this.  When are you going to let these guys roll instead of be the director?  You know?  Monday morning and you're taking this call, Opie?  Yeah, just to...  You are a brave soul.  Why not?  This is a Friday call.  Dr. J, we all have our crutches, sir. 
[00:40:30]  Anthony, you know it's true.  Everyone knows it.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Let me go with that one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I agree with you, Dr. J.  Yeah.  This is divide and conquer.  This is the divide and conquer guy.  This guy's out there all the time doing this.  Why is the caller ID coming up as Jimmy Norton's number?  Jimmy.  Dr. J, thanks for your phone call.  We appreciate it.  But you have no idea how a radio show works.  So I would just sit there and shut the fuck up.  Thank you.  Remember the guy that used to call up... 
[00:41:00]  Who was the racist guy?  Oh, that's awesome.  I don't know.  You should really do that.  That's awesome.  That's excellent.  You should really do that, Opie, and just let the two of us spin off into oblivion.  They'll just start dying.  You know what happened?  And then the conversation would degenerate into us talking about, I don't know, the hands  on the clock or something.  You're like, what?  There are asses out there that have no idea how this radio show works.  Have no idea.  Everyone has to play a role on this program.  And quite frankly, my role at times is very fucking boring. 
[00:41:30]  Very boring.  But then I have to be...  Someone in this room has to move on to other things.  Or like you said, it would just be a great conversation that turns into nothing eventually.  Just keeps going.  Yeah.  If you don't have some type of director on a movie, do you think, like, Keanu Reeves can  just riff a movie?  Do you think he can just riff a movie?  I don't think it's happening.  I can put it this way.  Hurricane Rita is still out there somewhere. 
[00:42:00]  Are we following the coverage?  No.  No?  It's now just blowing at, I don't know, maybe 25 miles an hour right now.  Yeah.  But are the news crews still running after it?  They've moved on.  Are they moving to that other town out there that is now being hit by Hurricane Rita where  the wind speeds are maybe 15 miles an hour?  Another story.  No!  The director has moved on to the next hurricane.  There's the next story in line.  Which is Scratch and Match.  Scratch and Match.  Do you...  You do remember the guy, though? 
[00:42:30]  The racist guy?  What was his name?  Which racist guy?  Oh!  Oh, wow.  He used to call up...  You know what I'm talking about.  This guy would call up and just...  Vinny the Racist.  Spout Vinny the Racist.  Thank you, Nathaniel.  He'd spout the most racist stuff and then when he's done, because I'd be going, oh my  God.  Yeah.  And he'd go, come on, Anthony.  You know what I'm talking about, right?  And they'd try to get you into the whole circle, like the divide and conquer thing.  Anthony Wright, come on now, huh?  Yeah.  Okay.  Right.  Right.  I used to work with a guy like that. 
[00:43:00]  He hated black people so much they wouldn't even be doing anything and he could still make  it sound bad.  He would just be in the car.  I'd be like, look at him.  Walking down the street.  What, dude?  I do that too, you know?  Walking.  No, but dude, you know, it's the way they do it, you know?  Like they fucking own the sidewalk or something.  It's like, not really, dude.  They're just kind of going to work.  That's a guy that doesn't like my role on the show.  What can I tell you?  We all have our haters. 
[00:43:30]  Dr. J.  I can tell you this much.  I've been doing radio since I was 18.  I make a lot of money doing it.  And if I was that bad, trust me, the company would love to get rid of my salary.  It's all about the numbers in the end.  So I think I'm doing just fine as far as XM thinks.  Dr. J.  Loser.  If that was an instant feedback, Opie, I'd have banned him.  I'd have banned him.  I didn't have to go there.  I went there, though.  Monday, though.  Wow.  I know.  That's such a Friday call because it's like, all right, goodbye.  I'm out. 
[00:44:00]  After you know you've had a lot of good stuff.  You've got a whole week.  You contributed to the show.  It's like, do you know what we did this week?  I know.  You rattle off like four hours a day of what we're doing.  Monday.  What did you do?  I woke up.  37 minutes into the first hour.  Your big accomplishment was answering your alarm clock this morning.  That's right.  That's it.  Eric in Jersey.  What's up, Eric?  What's going on, Anthony?  Anthony.  And opening the knee.  Yeah, we do get that a lot.  Opening an F and then opening the knee.  Opening the knee and then...  I have a tragic report about Rita. 
[00:44:30]  Yes.  I'm in Roseland, New Jersey, and my company's picnic might be postponed to Wednesday.  Why?  Because it may rain.  Oh, we're getting rain from this hurricane now?  Of course.  Is that what's going on?  Rita, what does it mean for our area?  We've gotten those reports.  Right.  Yeah, it's coming up.  We're going to get some rain, some humidity, and that's it.  So we're sandbagging the parking lot so we don't get it.  How do we handle Rita?  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  Bye.  And they try to make it sound like that. 
[00:45:00]  Rita headed our way, and they get on the weather.  The remnants of Rita should, you know, some rain.  Yeah.  Back to you.  By the way, to Dr. J, because I guarantee he's still listening.  See, I cut that phone call off because it was going nowhere and saved us about 30 seconds of bad radio.  No, that guy was, I think he was just picking up a head of steam.  John and Cortland, what's up?  Dr. J knows what I'm talking about.  Now I'm going to point out everything I do on the show today to Dr. J.  Oh, that'll be good.  All the subtle little things I do.  I'm pushing a button.  That I get no credit for. 
[00:45:30]  You watch, Dr. J.  It's going to build slowly into a rage.  You watch.  Of course.  By 5 of 11.  Did you see that, J?  What the fuck I'm talking about?  You sit back and watch.  I'm like a surgeon in here.  We love to think this shit just would brush it off.  It just rolls off us.  Nothing.  But it just, it's a slow build.  No, it never does.  When I did my HBO special, killing one girl in the crowd standing there.  She looked like Carrie in that movie. 
[00:46:00]  Just like she was willing me to bomb.  And I kept looking at her like, are you fucking kidding me?  What more do I got to do?  That's pissing you off.  Yeah, it did.  Everyone else is fucking dying.  I ended up seeing her in the green room and I fucking, I still had to glare at her.  Yeah, but what if she was just deaf?  She wasn't.  And happened to get a free ticket.  What was she doing in the green room?  I don't know.  She was a guest?  I don't know.  She was one of those fucking people that ends up being backstage and you have no idea why.  No idea who, how, why.  Yeah.  Did you go up to her and ask her why she didn't enjoy the performance? 
[00:46:30]  No, like an idiot because I have such a need to be liked.  I actually went over and I said, hey, how you doing?  And she kind of blew off my handshake.  Wow.  So I went in for another layer of gold.  Oh, you needy ass.  Yeah.  Go fuck yourself.  Howdy doody.  Oh, it's awful.  It's need to be loved.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's the word.  I think I walked home to my apartment talking to myself, saying the shit that I had wished,  that I said to her.  Well, you know, think about it though.  But obviously it was something you said very early in your act that just pissed her off 
[00:47:00]  where she couldn't get past that.  And that's all she was thinking the whole time you were up there.  Yeah.  Well, maybe she just thought I sucked.  What was your first joke?  I bet you it was like one of the first things you said.  Well, I do trash women in marriage in the beginning.  A lot.  She could have just been going through a divorce.  Right.  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  And then you can't get past that point.  You're sitting there just like.  Yeah, but you never think that when you're on stage.  Like, oh my God, she doesn't think I'm funny.  Man.  I suck.  Like, the rest of the crowd is going to figure this out.  She's going to start talking to him. 
[00:47:30]  I hate that needy thing because I do that at appearances and stuff.  Like, I'm the one.  Opie has no problem blowing people off.  I've seen it done.  I've seen people walk up to you.  And there are people that absolutely should be blown off and should be punched in the face sometimes.  It's just annoying.  Annoying.  And I sit there and I'll plaster the smile on.  No, cool.  Like, fucking, what's his name?  Paul the intern for Ron and Fez's show.  When he sat down at Caroline's and wouldn't leave. 
[00:48:00]  And he was drunk and obnoxious.  I should have just turned around and went, dude, could you leave?  I'm just having a moment here.  And he just wouldn't stop.  And there are people that are like that.  You know, you just get them.  Some of the fans are assholes.  No, you got to have a closer.  Yeah.  As you're grabbing the hands, you're walking away.  They won't leave.  I always go with like, well, listen, man, I'm glad you came out.  Doesn't matter.  Glad you had a good show and I'm already walking away.  They'll still follow you.  They will follow you.  I don't know what to do.  I smile.  Anthony, stop playing the victim.  Okay? 
[00:48:30]  You have control in this.  I have none.  It's the same.  There's nothing you can do.  Because I have to smile and be nice and sit there and listen to everything.  I can't just go, hey, hey, hey, I'm eating here or something.  Why not?  Invent a family tragedy or something.  Why can't you say something?  I don't know.  It's just the same thing Bill just said.  This need to be appreciated and I don't want them going and going, yeah, I met that guy.  What a fucking asshole.  You know, that bothers me. 
[00:49:00]  Everybody wants to be liked.  It doesn't matter what you do for a living.  It just doesn't matter.  That sounded like you were going to go into a song right there.  Everybody wants to be liked.  You think the guy that puts the dogs to sleep wants to be liked?  Of course.  At the pound, that guy?  I don't think he cares.  Even Saddam Hussein wants to be liked.  You think he wants to be liked?  Of course he does.  Even Saddam Hussein wants to be liked.  Everybody wants to be liked. 
[00:49:30]  Come on.  Let's get another verse.  I don't have one.  See, now that's one where I think we should have maybe stepped in and done a little.  And maybe stopped it before it got to the song.  The second verse.  The musical number.  No, I'm going to let you guys spin out.  You're just a little summer breeze.  We have to suffer because of Dr. J.  That's right.  You guys are going to be like Hurricane Katrina.  I'm going to let you guys get all the way to a summer breeze.  That's a little song segment.  Wasn't that nice?  Is that the kind of riffing that you wanted to hear between the two of us? 
[00:50:00]  Watch closely what I do on purpose today now, Dr. J.  You have no idea what you have started because it will make us laugh today because the eyes  are all going to look at me.  I'm going to be like, what?  What?  Oh, all right.  We'll go here next.  We were going to go to this clip here.  John and – oh, yeah.  We were up to John and Cortland.  John, what's up?  Hey, buddy.  Hey.  The Reddivan Susserian clip, Shepard Smith got blown right over on his ass like a box 
[00:50:30]  of rocks in that.  I know.  Everyone's talking about that.  I haven't seen the clip yet.  Was it funny?  Oh, funny as hell.  I rewound it five, six times laughing my ass off.  On live TV, he just fell over?  Oh, yeah.  Did he blow right off the screen?  Oh, the cameraman followed him right over onto his ass.  He staggered, getting up.  He looked like a drunk.  And going back to that, owing money for XM, I stole my brother a hundred bucks.  He just got it for me.  I just wanted to say, yeah, the check's in the middle. 
[00:51:00]  But your brother got you XM?  Well, I got it on a family and friends network.  Ah.  He lives down in Newburgh.  I live up there in Cortland.  He got me in under him.  I stole him the hundred bucks.  You should have stopped after the Shep thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not too late.  Or I could have stopped you after the Shep thing.  The people on the message boards have taken on that whole thing with punching out.  Yeah.  Some of the sig pics I've seen in Photoshop are huge plane crash sites.  Yeah.  And one little, like, comic strip bubble with punching out. 
[00:51:30]  Nope.  Too late.  In the middle of the wreckage.  You started the too late thing.  It's too late.  Too late.  Paul in Indiana.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  All right, Paul.  Friday night when they were doing this for coverage on Rita, did you see the...  CNN reporter get hit with the debris?  He was standing there and he got covered by a piece of cardboard.  Completely blacked him out of the screen.  Cardboard, eh?  Yeah.  It's not very exciting.  Cardboard or plywood.  They lost me with this hurricane, though. 
[00:52:00]  I didn't see, like, any time people bring up coverage like this, I'm usually, yeah,  I saw that.  I usually sit in front of Fox and CNN the whole time.  They lost me.  I really had no interest in watching this one.  I thought of Anthony when he got hit because he's just wanting anybody to get blown over  and hit.  See, you should have stopped before you even made the call, sir.  I asked me.  It was awful.  And Ovi's just leaving him on the line. 
[00:52:30]  You got any other ideas you want to...  Did you see anyone else get hit with anything?  No, but I know Bill Burr's my new idol.  Very good.  Bill, would you like to talk to him, Paul, for a little while?  Let's riff on this.  Yeah.  Hey, he's my idol for last week, man.  Oh, cool.  Riff on the women, just hammer on him.  Good deal.  What's your favorite color?  All right, Paul, thank you.  Have you played Scratch and Match?  No.  Made in the front page news stories here. 
[00:53:00]  Dr. J, you can call back any time and take it back, or it's going to be a long fucking  morning.  This is great.  Now we're going to have to bomb because of that asshole.  Sniper, happily married, ONA Army General.  Hey, Opie, if XM is so with a lot of O's, happy with you and your salary, why haven't  they picked up your entire contract yet?  Why are you working year to year and can't even commit to buying a house, you jizzbag with  a girlfriend with no boobs? 
[00:53:30]  What?  You're kidding, right, Sniper?  You're absolutely kidding, right?  You know when you're out of points to make, you fucking jizzbag?  You're kidding, right?  First of all, they have picked up next year, and I think the year after that.  They picked up all of mine, by the way, Opie.  Oh, really?  Yeah, and they just signed Bill.  I'm in deep trouble. 
[00:54:00]  I'm in deep trouble there.  And we said last week that we're looking at buying houses.  Why the anger today?  Why the anger?  Why the anger today?  It's starting to affect you, Opie.

You ignorant son of a fucking bitch.  Shut your goddamn mouth.  Preach.  You would think if there was a website dedicated to you, you'd be pretty happy, but this Church 
[00:54:30]  of Opie website is very, very creepy.  It's very creepy.  It's very, very disturbing.  What's the URL on that?  It's www.churchofopie.org.  Churchofopie.org.  Like it's a real organization.  It's not the church, or is it church?  I think it's just Church of Opie.  All right.  Thank you, Mark.  You're welcome.  All right.  We'll take another break.  They got Opie, the picture of you on Church of Opie is you behind the clouds with like  that holy light coming off from behind you.

[01:00:30]  You get to see what real crap it's made out of.  We're in the back.  What else does she has to do?  I'm a hurricane survivor?  By Tracy Chapman.

The hand goes up over their face and they're still just panning across with that camera with  the light.  Yeah.  Just getting everybody in the corner.  to have a nice hot meal today could you get the camera on my fucking face very embarrassing weekend 
[01:02:00]  today's lester holt is there with the latest lester good morning to you matt good morning  it's matt good morning we're here oh i'm here in front of a pile of author in many of these areas  hit crap yes there are homes like this utterly destroyed but there are others still standing  folks however can't get in officially at least to see that's a non-story sorry to say  this will go today that's probably one of those guys his front yard always looks like that  they just got nothing they gotta go to that guy who keeps the old car in the front yard yeah something 
[01:02:30]  tells me a lot of those houses just look like disaster areas do you think these guys set up  some of these shots obviously there's devastation but do you think they got some people to help them  uh pile it up to make it just said there's a lot of houses that are still standing god knows he's not  standing in front of that one right they pick i don't know if they're piling shit up on top but  you know damn well they're picking the exact angle that that camera is is pointing they're  looking how to how to block it a block it uh the shot right and where he's going to stand to make 
[01:03:00]  it look a lot worse than it is what if this is the only house that was destroyed on that whole block  and all they have to do is pan to the left and and there's a whole neighborhood a whole neighborhood  fine yeah you know they're showing some stuff going around on lawns and stuff yeah that those  those overhangs on gas stations are always flying off these days and that's uh you know it looks  bad but it's not i could knock a sign over you know what i mean yeah i could do that remember in  la remember the earthquake in la years ago that one shot that they showed of that street where a water 
[01:03:30]  main was broken and a gas main was broken and uh you saw this this big geyser of water and flames  shooting out of the street and the street was like cracked open uh that was the shot that every  news uh organization went to and meanwhile they one of them actually showed what was going on uh  side to side and it was perfectly normal all the houses were fine but that shot was the perfect stand  up shot it was water and fire and cracked uh ground like what an earthquake is supposed to do 
[01:04:00]  and that's what they're doing in these things walk around find a nasty house stand in front of it  all right let's say hi to rob on long island rob what's up rap hey guys what's going on hey  did you guys uh get the clip from family guy last night the op reference uh i didn't see  family guy last night i have it i have it here if you guys want me to play it no the guys are great  around here behind the scenes and they got uh the op drops from family guy last night yeah there was 
[01:04:30]  also a stern reference too yeah i don't know and what's your theory on that whole thing yeah i think uh  what they're doing is um coming up with episodes and putting some dialogue in there that they know  is going to turn up on popular radio shows that's pretty much it they're doing a show to make sound  bites for radio shows because then we'll play it and talk about family guy yeah all right thank you rob  no problem well here's the howard stern one they did on family guy last night i say anybody listen to  howard stern this morning he had some strippers in the studio they sounded hot then he made a joke about 
[01:05:00]  a negro but robin laughed so it was okay wow that's his whole show right you think he's laughing  or pissed off by that today that's pretty much his whole show holy they summed up his show in seven  seconds and then there's an op character yeah i gotta tell you i was a huge family guy fan and i'd never  i never jump back on the uh the old family guy uh no no i kind of like it still i i hit or miss i've 
[01:05:30]  seen one or two episodes this season that's it is it good is it as good as the dvd it's hit or miss  it's like you know i think in any one show you're gonna have moments that are really funny and other  ones are like what why they do that right well here's some uh drops from last night's show although  i may not fully understand opie's management style he has proven himself a more competent employee than  you opie was the uh the boss um and he was uh quite retarded that was great sticking great 
[01:06:00]  he has fingers in his ears and stuff does he say awesome a lot he's just going to buy that same  awesome or dar dar same thing this is your co-worker opie he is a burden of the state deemed  unfit for mainstream society hey you don't have to laugh that hard jesus it's not that funny of a  line big laugh from nathaniel a fan of that show yeah all right well that was cool that killed 10 
[01:06:30]  seconds what else do we have on that whatever there's a character i know everybody kept emailing  and calling up with that you got to play that well we did we did that's yeah it didn't sound  like it was it was just the same name yeah yeah i i say we get the movie trailers out of the way we  have eight brand new movie trailers that came in over the weekend well you know who we got to bring in

[01:07:30]  pissed off today by the way got to reach you forgot to recharge his car is that what it is ask him  about his condo he uh he just bought oh no i think he bought a lemon oh no just ask him about it here  comes martini steve steve the bear oh he means business today how many people in the studio he  touched right down yeah and you got the i hate you all t-shirt i love this shirt keith gave it to me 
[01:08:00]  i like the l's in all our uh handguns little berettas upside down yeah that's good what is that  from i think it's is it mafia life hold on let me turn around of course it is enough said mafia life  he's getting a piece of that action isn't he is he really i don't really gotta be he talks about it  all the time he like uh also will show up at the studio and he'll grab a mic waiting for his chance  to go mafia life.com yeah yeah oh that's a cool shirt though i hear it's a pretty good game i don't 
[01:08:30]  know don't know enough i haven't played it so steve how's your uh new condo fuck oh no i have  happened i have these beautiful granite counters and i would love to find the people that sold  this fucking place to me and smash their teeth into them oh no because not enough cushy leaves on the  bottom for hibernation yeah i i wish that was the least of my fucking problems well back up you had a  really nice condo right outside new york city yeah commute was not even booming also you're yeah we're  turning you down a little bit and uh you decided to get another condo in the same one at a bigger 
[01:09:00]  place so in the same condo complex there was one for sale and you know it was newly uh what no i'm  just thinking how you're not gonna be able to resell this fucking thing as you get on the radio  this fucking place is a chase no it's it's actually it's the the reality is it's a bigger place it's  right on the um it's right on the hackensack river so it's got a great romantic and you know and  it's the fact is it's right outside my commute is 12 minutes it's right outside of manhattan and 
[01:09:30]  you know it's it's it's a place where the real estate values you know aren't going to go down  anytime soon so i'm happy to have it but on the hackensack river windy oh my god the people  the people that renovated this place in order to sell it chintzed out so much on the contractors  they used that every and it wasn't stuff that we were going to find right off the bat with a home  inspector so oh boy as i'm living in it now i'm finding stuff little by little and you've  only been in this place what two three weeks a month maybe two or three days oh no in two days 
[01:10:00]  you're finding shit you know it's funny it's probably like a hollywood set where you thought  you had cabinets and they're just fake there's like nothing behind like a twilight zone episode  where they wake up and they're in a fake house you go to open up the cabinet or use the phone and it  pulls right off the wall that's that's actually not a bad reference because that's that's the  quality of construction we're talking about here they found they must have found guys that didn't  have any like uh contractor licenses because the the work they did is so shoddy and they're all  working down at rockefeller center today during the today show what you got and you didn't notice this 
[01:10:30]  as you were looking at the place before you bought it we actually we had a ruthless house inspector  who went through and checked everything and we found a lot of it when when he was there and they  went back and fixed a lot of it like stuff like the dishwasher they put in a brand new dishwasher but  they didn't space it out right so when you opened up the door it was banging into the brand  new cabinets they put in oh man that type of stuff that type of stuff like cabinets like  brand new cabinets in the kitchen but you can't open two at the same time because they'll rub into  each other that kind of stuff um brand new light fixtures but you really ever have to open two at 
[01:11:00]  the same time no but it's when you're searching yeah when you're looking around where the fuck is  good point uh all right brand new light fixture when you turn it on you get electrocuted  little things like that brand new light fixture but when you turn it on you realize your phone is on a  dimmer switch oh your phone dude i might my like the outlet that i plug my phone into yeah  is on a dimmer outlet for some reason so i didn't even realize that until i yeah until a day after  i plug in the phone i'm like how come the phone down here isn't ringing then i turn the lights on 
[01:11:30]  in the house i realize oh the phone just went on uh steve we're gonna need you to record something  i'm gonna make sure you come in kind of early and  i swear to god my everyone sounds like tara reed  hi steve yeah um make sure you read this  i'm on a dimmer switch i'm so wasted this is awesome 
[01:12:00]  new tower reed clips on the way by the way you ever see that that movie the tom hanks shelley long  movie the money pit ah that is i'm i'm having flashbacks or just what was the first thing you  found wrong you're walking around your house the wiring the wiring wiring i had the phone that's  just a small problem and the cable guys in there not one cable guy but four cable guys at the same  time wow in the house re-running all the cable to every room because the people that had done the 
[01:12:30]  renovations when they put the new floors in and the new walls in they cut through all the phone lines  and the cable lines oh man so like you'd look at this cable wire coming out of the floor and you'd pull  on it and instead of you know getting like a little little bit of give the whole thing would  come out because they severed it some way along the you know the contractor had like those time  life home improvement books open on the counter now yes what's the rewiring your house it is  so bad and the phone lines were like that too so the phone lines and the cable lines had to get 
[01:13:00]  rerun through the entire house all right oh you poor bastard you like slam a door and you hear  plaster coming down inside your walls funny you should mention it because  the latest problem last night was the the brand new uh master bathroom which is you know retiled  and everything has a brand new uh uh shower stall with beautiful tile is leaking through to the  fucking living room wait what oh my the bathroom the bath the new shower stall shower stall it took 
[01:13:30]  uh it's upstairs it's upstairs on the second floor it took a total of three showers so it's not like  water's getting on the bathroom floor this is the actual shower stall that's leaking well we got out of  the first the first time i took a shower my my wife looks at it and says that's funny look at  the water collecting and i'm like where was it collecting on the floor of the bathroom i thought  okay maybe it's just a bad grouting job getting out of the stall and leaking yeah whatever the um  it's called the pan in the bottom of the shower okay it looks like it's just leaking onto the floor  i'm like all right maybe it wasn't grouted right we can caulk it and you know it'll be okay oh my god 
[01:14:00]  three showers later i'm walking downstairs and i hear drip drip oh no oh you poor bastard the hell is that i  look up in the right uh in the sheetrock ceiling above the fireplace which is directly underneath  where that shower is i see buckled sheetrock ceiling just a pool of sweat just oh i'm looking at this  going uh you got to be kidding me and then it's just dripping dripping onto this brand new hardwood  floor and uh oh my oh god what what is this have you taken it out on your wife yet uh no no because 
[01:14:30]  she's she's she's almost catatonic at what's going on she went to put her head through the wall and it  went right through it was barely any pressure it was no beams behind there to really cause any  damage she didn't get any bruises nothing nice and mushy so i so last night i stuck my hand through  the sheetrock ceiling and just ripped down chunks of it because oh that's good that's what you want  to do in a new play oh it's well unfortunately that's what you got to do in order to make sure  it doesn't you don't get mold in the uh yeah well if you see your ceiling dripping there's a hell of a 
[01:15:00]  a lot more damage above what you're seeing exactly like when you see a wet spot on on your ceiling  uh it's a lot worse than than what you're looking at exactly so i'm hoping i'm hoping  tip of the iceberg thank you bill so i would love to find these people and just smash them  finds out his downstairs toilets made out of styrofoam spray painted gray  it sounds like you didn't inspect this place too good inspected it really well  what happened with the inspector the inspector found a lot of stuff the first thing the inspector  saw was the uh the toilets weren't secured down like all like all three bathrooms that had been 
[01:15:30]  redone the toilets weren't um weren't bolted to the floor they let you in the house there it is  over there don't get too close i just painted everything so much stuff like upon home inspection  and we were like all right you know you and your shoddy construction assholes have to redo x y  and z and we found a list of 12 things and we thought okay that's it turns out there was a lot  more than that that we just didn't catch and it wasn't something you were going to find until  you'd actually lived in it there are so many things you have to do no you know what you got to do you 
[01:16:00]  got to turn on all the water in the house yeah you got to turn on the showers and hang out let it let  him go run for a while yeah see how long the hot water lasts well that's what that's exactly that's  exactly what he did like he aimed the shower head right towards the drain and it did for 10 15 minutes  didn't leak so i'm thinking you're not going to see it it was probably leaking but it takes a little  while to get through the sheetrock yeah apparently and that's what we're finally seeing uh but you're  saying if you go to buy a house that's what you're supposed to do yeah turn on the water let it run  see how long the hot water lasts because sometimes you go into these places now you need a new hot 
[01:16:30]  water heater because the the cold water after three minutes you can't have two things running at once  run the dishwasher run the shower check to see how hot it's getting well that's one of the things we  knew we needed people must hate you when you come over fuck them fuck um oh it's great we had we  actually had a great home inspector and like like like for instance a new water heater was one of  the things i knew i needed you know that's just it happens you know it gets ten nine or ten years  old you have their electric bill by 200 bucks and you're just like you know what i'm not gonna buy  it i don't want it i'm not making an offer turn on the ac i want the doors open i want to see if 
[01:17:00]  you can actually air condition outside like my father used to say what are you air conditioning  the whole neighborhood i want to do that with your house you gotta you gotta do that you gotta go on uh  rainy days you gotta go when it rains take a look around at the windows all the windows at the  skylights shit like that see if that fucking shit's leaking it's very involved buying it not  true you know you know they set it up anthony just of course they do anthony just brings his 
[01:17:30]  his own hose yeah i'm just gonna work your house i bring a fire truck with me go ahead hose the roof down  climbing up on the roof just blasting everything because you just don't know and the only way you you know  these things is by learning them the hard way yeah the house i'm renting now and i'm renting it in  great neck the roof leaks roof leaks and i find this out that the skylight leaks after a week we've  been living there and we get a downpour and i just start hearing boop boop on the terracotta tile floor 
[01:18:00]  right where i decide it's actually about five inches in front of where i decide to put my brand  new 65 inch television so that was kind of close that was a close one and then the air conditioner starts  leaking the condensate on that so you got to call the guy he fixes it but not before a whole line  of spackle tape comes down in the living room oh and then it's raining a couple of weeks back and we  notice that over one of the kitchen cabinets weep weep weep there's drip going on over there 
[01:18:30]  and we i go out to the the back uh deck one day and the whole gutter to the back of the house is  laying on the deck just fell off the side of the house then on a windy day one of the trees by the  driveway just fell over into the driveway and uh the um the moths i i have no idea where they're  coming from what they're doing there but there are moths in the house a number of ways it's a moth  army they have taken over the house and you're running a nice house right yeah very nice i look like 
[01:19:00]  a schizoid at night i'll be laying there watching tv out of nowhere in the dark my girlfriend gets  awakened by me going like or i go trying to blow the moth away it's moths moths and there's nothing  i could do about it they're laying eggs in your mouth when you're in my ears but that's you know  that's what we do now we wake each other up by just clawing at the air like lunatics 
[01:19:30]  and uh that's just what i can remember and it's stories like that that make you not make you realize  that you might not have it so bad or at least there's a hundred other people that have gone  through the same experience that you have why don't you get like netting around your bed  you want like a malaria you should buy them like a beekeeper out  that would be nice here come the photoshops on whackbag.com anthony we're watching movies and  and like all of a sudden like last night we're watching uh alexander we'll talk about that homo 
[01:20:00]  movie later now to say it now man no and then we'll get back to steve because no i i i'll wait a  little later because i was i just want to talk about the the moths okay on the tv they show this outdoor  scene and uh there's like a mountain range the himalayas and the sky and it is moths flying  toward the sky because it's the brightest thing in the room because the lights are off and we're  joking about you know giant moths in the movie it kind of takes you out of the movie when there's  giant moths flying over the himalayas they will go to any light source at all you click over the the 
[01:20:30]  light over our heads on on the bed the bedroom set thing to grab something and like they just  flock to them they come at you and they turn it off and they come out of nowhere right yeah yeah  if you have company you got to try to play it off is that a moth no no it's just a plasma screen  they look that real we walk into high definition television you idiot we walk into your house right  now we're gonna see moths absolutely you'll just see one absolutely one dude on the walls in the 
[01:21:00]  hallway for some reason they're congregating when i turn on the air conditioner they congregate around  the return air grill i think maybe they're slowly the airflow kind of moves them in that direction  but then in the morning i shut the ac off or the house gets too cold when i go to turn it off that  hallway i turn the light on yeah and it's just moth hallway they're all over the walls you know they're  preparing for an attack right of course they are they're moths i know how they act how they operate 
[01:21:30]  do you go on a killing spree um no i i kill them at my leisure when they kind of fly near me i'll  claw at them or slap them or flick them but i get that white powder yeah they're too annoying to to  clean up i'd rather they just flutter in an area i'm not i only use the bedroom and and the living  room anywhere else the moths have taken over they live there i'm paying rent for the moths i don't know 
[01:22:00]  what to do about it it's so weird and and they came yeah out of nowhere one day one day they were  there before they weren't a time of year i'm just i'm just waiting them out until winter i know they  can't survive the winter what if you just crank the ac to the point that they all die kind of like  that b movie the killer bees they drove into the super or the blob where they put them in the movie  theater and turned on the air conditioner and hit them with the co2 that too blob fit into a movie 
[01:22:30]  theater the original oh sure wait i want to know more about the bees in the superdome like that one  of those killer bees killer bees yeah oh right it was all they beeped the horn on the little uh volkswagen  bug yeah all the bees came on it and then they drove into the superdome and they turned on the ac and  then they all died what a horrible movie are you kidding me yeah that was a really bad movie i  remember that one but i think that's the solution just freeze them out freeze them out i'll crank it  down and like 50 degrees so steve what are you gonna do um start calling contractors and that's really 
[01:23:00]  it is is just piece by piece as we find these things we can just there's no lemon law with the  house i don't know i'm finding that out i mean it might just be that i'm screwed uh since you know  everything's the house has been closed i don't know if there is a um no what the fuck clause i  don't know i don't know that's a really good question i mean i'm gonna cost you a lot of  money you just have a collage of pictures you know what the fuck what the fuck come on come on  i'm just that's your defense it's yeah come on like come on well we we we felt like we found out 
[01:23:30]  they didn't get any construction permits so i'm hoping that there's something oh goody we're  hoping that they're retroactively we can go back and nail them for that so you always find this  shit out afterwards what about if they violated some sort of construction code you can't  that's exactly i think that they'll probably condemn your house throw you out you won't be  able to live in there well thank god i still own the other one so i can oh you're a two oh oh look  at you a little mobile steve trump but they didn't pick up our contracts how are you able to uh yeah  look at you you're uh just praying a little nervous i bet well you know the idea is you rent the rent

[01:26:30]  the moths can have this one nick in wisconsin what's up yeah uh steve i was wondering was erica  strada involved in selling you the condo i didn't know you've seen erica strada  walking these uh condos down in florida but they actually actually built his house right outside  radio city musical did he get in trouble or something the company he was working for did  yeah they weren't even selling houses they were selling land in like some marshy part yeah it was  land it kind of made it they made it sound like you were buying a house and the pictures they would 
[01:27:00]  show were these beautiful neighborhoods uh with these houses but you were buying land that  theoretically you can build this type of house on there he is you might remember me from chips  yeah he gets on and hawks his uh real estate deals and then they found out that it was really a sham  right let's go to trench mouth the trucker trench mouth hey what's going on this morning what's up

[01:28:00]  out with the tweezers and then the poor little fellas will just suffocate in the middle of the  vacuum good uh scott in ohio what's up hey you gotta get rid of those moths man they'll end up in  your cereal boxes and everything else that's a nice present in the morning no i haven't found any in  food that's good i don't think they're the type that go in your food these are uh these are just  hanging around moths haven't found any in the food that i just remembered i think i blocked this out  that happened to me this weekend really what i bought a box of cereal at a at a bodega never a 
[01:28:30]  good thing to do stop it why so i'm eating uh corn checks i believe and i look down on my my milk  after having a couple of bites and i see like like a like a little one of the little flies and i'm just  like god damn it i throw the whole thing out i'm thinking it flew in there yeah so the next day you  know i'm just chowing and i look down after you know i'm watching sports center and i  look down and there's about seven drowned little bugs in there and i was just like you gotta they're 
[01:29:00]  in the they're in the box you know how many you ate probably ate a few of them 14  i like brush my teeth i'm flossing like oh i'll tell you what's unreal is it still was a good bowl  of cereal until really until you found out i understand those starving people now i'll eat  that oh yeah god all right steve well good luck on the house thank you that stinks did al roker put 
[01:29:30]  in your uh your dishwasher hey uh we brought you in here because we got movie trailers oh yeah you  got eight over the weekend uh no we got like 16 16 those are the eight that weren't completely  horrible ah well yeah but there's a whole variety here there's uh you labeled all of them yeah i  label i mean there's steve's very tough with production by the way the first one not bad  second one music too loud no sense the third one stinks fourth one's okay fifth one could be better  decent concept it's like grading papers well you know what i i'm trying not to judge them on production 
[01:30:00]  value because a lot of these people don't have pro tools rigs at home so i'm trying to judge them on  content like there seems like they're starting to get the idea behind the concept of the movie trailer  like it's got to have some kind of storyline that it's got to follow but even then it's falling  how many of these start with in a world half of them uh hold on two seconds um neil yeah uh your  fucking phone screener is a fucking rude asshole even howard's guys are cool and it takes hours to 
[01:30:30]  get through to them let neil through please let him through because i'm sure what he has to say uh what  you guys screened out and and decided wasn't worthy for the air i'm sure it's such genius it's  such brilliance it's such great conversation it's going to make for a great portion of the show when  neil calls in what people are so self-important this guy actually believes what he had to contribute  was so good and the screeners can't figure it out god i bet you you stink i bet you're awful look if he 
[01:31:00]  calls back and neil please call uh let him through gotta hear what this guy has to contribute  gotta hear it what's with all these people that think they know how to do a radio show today  oh i bet and then he's got to say he's got to throw that in yeah howard's guys are cool man  this is the guy that just calls up every radio show and just never gets through because he never  has anything good to say all right well the sixth trailer steve wrote worth playing just to smash 
[01:31:30]  which one oh is that carmine's yeah yeah wait carmine he had one last week and it was still  trying right so he's trying but it's not working uh the seventh movie trailer good music clips make  no sense though and then finally the steve from yellowstone trailer by dan of the dead above average  yeah it follows it follows some kind of continuity all right why don't we uh take a break and we'll do 
[01:32:00]  the opian anthony movie trailers next how's that right and we're gonna uh wait for neil's call as well  what did she do to you man nothing she was just walking tracy chapman yeah she's a big star today  on the today show because she's hammering some nails said there was a world of hurt going on under  her button down shirt right looked like she had a beer gut what has she been up to since fast car  nothing you got a fast car and i couldn't stand that song that was one that had to be shut off

[01:33:30]  maybe if she gets in that car and they just drive fast you got a fast car leave all her problems  behind into a pole  i think she's singing the plot to every good time episode  i was just watching that again the other day  anytime someone has good news on that show it's just over dude it's like gilligan's island they got  they're getting off the island and somebody puts their foot through the bottom of the book 
[01:34:00]  it's like they're getting out of the ghetto and you're psyched finally someone's getting out  but no they're not getting out james twisted his ankle there was one where james was supposed to get  a a job with the union and uh he was gonna get a raise it was something like seven dollars an hour  something ridiculous like that and uh he went down for the interview but before he went for the  interview he told uh florida to plan and buy everything for this big party and she's like 
[01:34:30]  but james we need this money for the rent and james goes don't worry we're gonna have plenty of money  when i get this job and she spent all of their rent money all the money for the bills to to have this  big party what kind of party just a party that they're james is getting a good job you know that  much money party to throw into a party they put some streamers up walona comes over they talk about  how i'm getting out of here baby and then james goes down and uh the guy of course the white boss down 
[01:35:00]  there tells uh him that he can't have the job because he's too old and that was done oh there she is  how many losses how much hammering  ow motherfucker  that's her latest song sounds great ben why are you in studio wasn't she didn't she perform on the 
[01:35:30]  streets in like harvard square in cambridge wasn't she like a street performer and get founded by some  record guy oh then i think so i think she was actually i don't mind other than that fast car  song was just too depressing hate that song oh all right why don't we play some movie trailers james  opian anthony movie trailers where you got a job at the dairy queen they're gonna make me manager and  everything let's have a party there was another one there and white people bulldoze down the 
[01:36:00]  fucking dairy queen it was always some fucking whitey would always screw up their dreams always  well on the other day like last night i was watching one and uh she goes comes in she goes guess  who's the new buyer at the boutique and everyone's like oh my goodness that's wonderful  and then uh some guy from in her uh uh life comes back and uh he's always some scumbag just like a  pimp you know that comes back and goes you know i love you baby and he gets an applause break just  because of his wardrobe yeah he comes in there like whoo he's wearing like complete leather clothes and 
[01:36:30]  the pimp hat and gets the woo from the audience and uh and they just turn out to be the most  despicable scumbags like one was trying to pick up on the daughter from the the evans house there  what's her name the one you like oh uh felma felma oh she like born it cornered her in the in the  kitchen and starts like groping her and this was the one will on is like i think this is the one  i think this one's i'm gonna marry him and he's groping the daughter in the kitchen 
[01:37:00]  they're all like these despicable scumbags every dream they have is just crushed  great show i love it all right and you would think even though they're poor i was watching  and then thinking i understand they're poor and everything but that doesn't mean you can't take  a fucking brillo pad to the goddamn wall they got those um the uh cinder block painted walls like you  get in a school or an institution and it's just soot covered it's black their cabinets are just 
[01:37:30]  filth ridden and florida seems like the type that would clean up though it's just it wouldn't come  off you get a new york apartment you know that tub's not that bad i'll i'll start scrubbing it and  you just you go to scrub and it's just like that doesn't come off this is the color of the tub  perma dirt yeah yeah i love that show are you still getting us back for that dr j uh yeah we're  through with the um the good times stuff yeah we've been through if you want to go uh go on to  something else what i think we exhausted yeah we uh sure i could probably dig up another episode 
[01:38:00]  but i'd rather not just making sure because dr j knows how to do a jj gets stabbed let's see how  much we can just bomb with this maybe we uh maybe that was a good one maybe we'll just have dr j as  part of the show today and he could tell us when to move on that was that was one of the episodes  where um it was very special norman lear used to do these sometimes with all in the family or good  times mod when they'd have a special episode where rape was involved or something and it would just 
[01:38:30]  end with the audience going oh and they'd roll the credits without the music so and very dramatic  and back then for some reason there was always static when the credits come on so you just hear  like on this silence of just the credits going and because the the weird kind of tv did you have  an old zenith you ever have a white background on your tv that just makes static just goes out of 
[01:39:00]  nowhere no was this back just me the howdy doody program was on no it wasn't back and there was  nothing else the dumont network yes an old zenith shut up do you remember the edward r murrow show no i  don't i don't the people dancing as cigarette packs in the middle of this show when the  fuck was this anthony when the fuck were you born it was the 70s and for some reason how old are you  for some reason if it's just a bare white background yeah well it it will make a noise you'll hear 
[01:39:30]  like this staticky noise uh through the speakers and then the credits would change and the  the the nothing no no one knows knows about this that's not that's not static it's what that's a  noise yeah it's it's white it's white noise from the white background actually was that claribel's  horn that no actually anthony is right because i was in uh i used to i used to produce some uh local 
[01:40:00]  commercials yeah i'll have to bring in my reel someday and uh too much white on the screen yes would  would uh make some kind of noise now this drives me crazy because in hotels a lot of times because  they have the older tvs yeah the older tvs because i don't think and a lot of new tvs a lot of commercials  uh they used to just a white background like a cable i think does a cable vision does one where  it's just white background with this red writing on it and the red kind of gets speckled white and the 
[01:40:30]  letters actually get distorted because the background is is white and it goes makes a really  loud noise it's and it used to happen with the credits because you wouldn't hear the good times  music playing in the background because it would be a sensitive touching episode and you would just  hear that noise no idea what he's talking about yes i do i've stayed in motel sixes i mean where  are you never seen this happen not that kind of a no that's the kind of make me put my foot through  the screen it's not static yeah you're right it's not that's static it's a a buzzing noise it's a 
[01:41:00]  very obnoxious noise and sometimes when the tv's off i hear it in my head it just goes of course you  do let's go to matt in atlanta matt that's those moths flying around what's going on hey uh uh opi i'm  going to do your job this morning bring you back to the uh to the good times oh thank you didn't know  anthony could remember the one where michael fell down the elevator shaft oh because somebody white 
[01:41:30]  left it open was working on the elevator shaft and uh michael turns around and waves goodbye to  everybody in the apartment and falls down the shaft oh classic classic that's it boys punch it out uh  let's go to jimmy in staten island jimmy yeah my favorite on the family special episode was edith's  book getting raped yeah did she even get racial i think it was an attempted rape what are you doing  yeah come on oh stop it what are you doing and don't touch me oh it's awful this creepy guy chasing 
[01:42:00]  around the house ellis and philly ellis hey that buzzing noise was one of the anthony's childhood  moths hitting one of the tubes inside his book no it wasn't it was not let's go to rob in jersey rob  hey how's it going hey man hey rob i just i just want everyone to know that professor anthony is  a hundred percent correct oh when there is a bright white screen on tv you will get a buzz and it's 
[01:42:30]  actually really hot video the video is so strong that it's actually supposed to bleed through over  the audio track yeah there you go so i am getting instant feedback opi i can't even read how many uh i'm  getting in support of me that's mash used to do the silent endings other people who have zenith yeah  that's right that's we know we have an older audience as well the old zenith tv where you'd  click it on you'd pull the little thing and we go bill and i just want to know how old you really  are you've been padding your age with your rca phonograph 642 years old hey i'm from new orleans 
[01:43:00]  speaking of tv uh can we go back to alexander oh alexander i watched that uh last night by the  the way i hope uh dr j realized that i was trying to control when aunt was going to tell that story  and said no i'm not ready to tell that right so i don't really control everything there are there  are times when other people do control because the moth story was more important i was thinking i could  seg into that for you but i never would have gotten back to the moths you called off the sign 
[01:43:30]  i called i wait you were the pitcher and you said no i don't want to go curveball i don't want to go  curveball now i'm throwing heater for a little longer i'll get to the curveball a little later we'll  get to it so uh are you ready to tell your story about alexander the great alexander i was watching  that uh last night uh oliver stone's version of alexander the great and um uh who the hell's in that  that jared uh uh leto what's his name i can't watch period pieces no uh the second they bring out 
[01:44:00]  those wigs you can well yeah there were some really sleep god awful uh wigs in the movie let me punch it  up here so i have my actors love doing those pieces they get to use that those accents and they get to  show their acting chops they have to go do shakespeare how much of a moron do i sound like the shakespeare  stuff fucking sucks that culture shit yeah they always have to put on and uh the accent and um 
[01:44:30]  speak in that old world speaky and uh yeah some people can pull it off do it well others uh sorry  you can't anthony hopkins was in it oh by the way let me see um who else was in that one who's the big  star why can't i get his name god damn it brad pitt no colin farrell as everyone's yelling colin  farrell at their radio which movie was brad in he had a period piece recently what in troy interview 
[01:45:00]  what's the difference between troy and alexander the great or whatever uh believe it or not alexander  more gay than troy was and troy pretty gay you saw troy too oh of course i like the uh the battle scenes  yeah not enough battle heart i did i did i love that movie i gave up after braveheart i i just  thought no lord of the rings has good battle sequences but that's not a period piece it's  kind of a mythological period it's mythological we're talking about period pieces well this is 
[01:45:30]  all mythological too greek mythology and um uh hold on sort of a gay rump it's very gay matt from florida  go ahead hey i got a way you can find out how old he is yeah grab a lock of his hair and they  can carbon date it like they do the mummies all right take my hair get over here get away from me  with that carbon dating i'll be carbon dating anthony's hair i just need a little snip you can't carbon date 
[01:46:00]  hair my gonna be bone my new theory is that anthony is actually a vampire yeah you're a vampire stop it  you've been coming up with some references that uh i don't know i've been working with you for 10  years and all these references have been in a vault somewhere it's the history channel and the discovery  channel that's where i get my info all right troy gay alexander gayer gayer now i heard from uh i i read  reviews on this a while back when it first came out in the movies and uh heard from people that have 
[01:46:30]  seen it and they said uh that there were some gay like undertones to this movie is it an  undertone or an overtone would be very overt in your face right an undertone would be something  that's implied you kind of think it's happening yeah i just want i just want to say it before i get  8 000 instant feedback going hey asshole it's an overtone i think it's undertone anyway gayness  there was some gay undertones in the movie it was it's an completely gay because the head just pops 
[01:47:00]  up a little bit every once in a while so it's an undertone it's under but it's popping up a little  bit so it's an undertone it wasn't just implied gayness uh alexander that his character colin farrell's  character was uh gay and it started as as like a kid they had him as a kid wrestling with his little  friends uh like they did back then and uh then he gets a little older and he gets his uh boyfriend 
[01:47:30]  he had his little boyfriend and that was jared uh jared lato it was a brave performance courageous  courageous anytime uh uh somebody straight plays somebody gay they always say that well let me  tell you something brave performance the only reason i think people thought it was an undertone  of gayness was because they weren't just fucking each other in the ass blatantly  anyone who said this was gay like implied gayness yeah really needs just man ass gay pornography to go 
[01:48:00]  i think that guy might be gay because this i mean he's kissing men he's kissing men  in this movie and the relationship between him and jared lato uh was just completely a gay relationship  and i didn't know i i go into this movie thinking i'm gonna see an oliver stone some action  some not that kind of action i wanted to say you know you're hoping for some sword fighting  i was no sword fighting docking you you needed a docking scene i was hoping for some talking 
[01:48:30]  but uh i wanted uh more battle sequences and uh they didn't give it i think that's why the movie kind  of tanked a little too much of this uh lovey-dovey stuff between men and uh not enough uh fighting  action let's go to opie's hog opie's hog what's up hey uh um anthony how does this compare with  your memories of what actually happened 
[01:49:00]  all right very funny  assholes so you were very uncomfortable by the gay overtone or undertone you know something i'm not  uncomfortable by it but it it takes you out of the movie because you're watching and kind of go  ah jesus what are you doing when colin farrell uh grabs some guy uh that just did this homo erotic  dance with another man on the floor and grabs him and just starts uh open mouth kissing him 
[01:49:30]  i can't just sit there and go yeah that's really got a great place in this movie and that you just get  taken aback and go oh wow is that the noise you make or is it more like i went like oh because  the moth was on me i did that first and then i went oh wow because of the gayness yes anytime that  happens in the movie like and you know the actor's straight that takes me out of it if i can see him  going like trying to psych himself up to do the scene yeah what movies are you watching that gay men 
[01:50:00]  are actually gay and doing this that you're sitting on staying with somebody straight yeah that's what i  mean uh do you have an option to that are there movies that you have seen where gay men are gay  and they're doing gayness didn't not jay doesn't take you out of the movie have to kiss somebody  yeah some movie yeah jay moore and uh i don't remember yeah that was one of those so it's like  jay straight so i'm watching it going like a guy from party of five i think let's ask jay i mean jay  listens to the show every day maybe you can call us uh later on this week because yeah who'd you make 
[01:50:30]  out with you faggot he listens during the replays call us up what goes through your head are you saying over  and over again i could do this i could do this i'm doing one fucking take of this and that is  it something has to go yeah it's movie go scott wolf scott wolf thank you and go yeah that was ben  when you're reading the script and it comes up okay you walk into the room now you embrace  and open mouth kiss uh this man what do you think you think it's a great part i don't want to like  i really like the script right up until that point do you think you could talk the guy out of it 
[01:51:00]  or do you just go hey it's a role and i'm gonna do it i'm an actor whoa i'm not this will get me an  oscar i'm not buying that so you liked alexander the great um uh what limited battle sequences there  were were pretty cool but oliver stone's kind of bad at it he directed this and it's kind of ripping  off who everybody that has done the battle sequence of late from braveheart up until now like you know how 
[01:51:30]  that's the shaky battle sequence not really all the very graphic violence but it's very shaky it's  extreme close-ups too i hate that yeah a lot of the extreme close-ups they did in gladiator they did it  in uh uh lord of the rings um all those battle sequences it kind of i guess it's easier to pull  off if the camera's shaking yeah but a lot of times the shakiness of the camera kind of makes sense  like it's happening when maybe those big elephants are stomping down and and the camera will shake a  little bit but oliver stone it just seemed like he was shaking the camera for everything the guy 
[01:52:00]  takes his sword out of the scabbard and it's just the camera shaking just got annoying take the sword  out of the the the sheath the scabbard the uh the holster the holster the knife holster what is it  called uh a scabbard how do you spell that uh i have no idea my spelling is awful we get you  you can't spell yeah when i was on the bounty i used to wear one but they call it a scabbard uh  yeah did you know that bill there's a few words for it a scabbard i tuned out like halfway through 
[01:52:30]  that story did you i'm sorry and how do you know that it's called a scabbard um watching uh discovery  channel i remember um forget aristotle and socrates here comes professor anthony socrates used to just go  on and on bill burr sitting in for jim norton and i see that uh just like jim you're with me on this  one thank god well when jimmy's in here and anthony just throws out these big words that no one else

[02:01:00]  i wanted to be the first kid on my block to get a confirmed kill  every day  what the hell i can't even hear it come on in here steve that is really funny because steve  gets really frustrated he has to listen to all these things wow steve what's going on there huh  what's going on sorry what i couldn't hear you so the canopy opened yeah what was going on there 
[02:01:30]  it was too loud it was just the music drowns out anything that's going on so you really don't know  what kind of audio is underneath this uh this cinematic music so are you telling crazy scott to  maybe turn down the music a little so we could hear this trailer telling crazy scott your music's  too loud all right we're going to give him another shot we're not even going to listen to any more of  that didn't cut through crazy scott send it off to steve at foundry music.com all movie trailers go  to steve at foundry music.com all right yes the next one you said uh stinks by das burchin 
[02:02:00]  yeah thank you that i can't pronounce his name i try to remember which one this was it looks like  it sounds like he's speaking german underneath it but i don't we're all about the nicknames on this  program but some of these guys that are regular contributors to the show we don't  really know how to pronounce your nicknames he either use d-a-s-u-b-e-r chin what am i missing  here what is that what is it thank you what did you say something close to das uber chin and what 
[02:02:30]  does that mean i have no idea like a big chin a big chin all right i have to clear this up no i uh  my home security uh does not include a cauldron of hot lead over the doorway  hatch from munaki  but he is building a moat one shovel at a time yeah steady  shovel full at a time all right here we go das das uber chin

[02:03:30]  now our bill died today oh my god people scared beyond wit's end i don't know dickhead  story jim norton i'm paranoid i have issues and some other guys 
[02:04:00]  With a special appearance by Samuel L. Jackson.  I don't remember asking you a goddamn thing.  It's the Obi and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:04:30]  Rated F4.  I closed big.  I don't know what to think of that one.  I didn't get it.  It went nowhere.  No, it went nowhere.  He kind of did a good job at making it sound creepy during one point,  but I don't know what that means.  Creepy and non sequitur all over the place.  It's just a farce.  He used to work on the fade in and fade out of music.  Karma Chameleon came up and down in two seconds.  Come up, come up, come up, come up. 
[02:05:00]  With Jimmy Norton.  All right, well, he's trying.  But again, how do you judge it?  These guys don't have professional editing rigs,  so you have to take that out of the equation now?  No.  No, no.  People are commenting.  They're saying, do these people even listen to these when they're through with them,  or do they just send them right off the street?  A lot of them come with emails that say,  dude, I spent four to five hours on this, and I think it's great.  You will too.  And then you hear it, and it makes no sense.  Well, we've got a lot of good ones that have come in. 
[02:05:30]  No, I'm not completely negating all of them, but your barometer gets thrown completely off  after 16 or so because you forget the way you have to judge them because you don't know  if you're judging them on content.  Well, maybe if more people sent some in, it would up the average of a good one.  I really don't like that.  That would be great.  All right.  Then more for you to go through, Steve.  Yeah, I agree with Bill Burr.  We just need more people.  Yes, definitely.  Send them to Steve at foundrymusic.com.  I think you should send them to bill at billburr.com.  I've got a Casio keyboard with some sound effects in my apartment. 
[02:06:00]  I might try to put something together.  Whip one up.  Bill's going to try one.  Okay, you do that.  The next one is by, I'll just make it so fucking heinous, you want to kill yourself.  Who's Ray the intern?  Ray, is he here today?  No.  We have an intern named Ray.  We do.  Ray's the Hawaiian-looking kid.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Very memorable.  Ray's got a great voice, though.  Yeah?  Ray's got a really great voice.  His production chops are eh, but he's got a great voice.  And you kind of liked it. 
[02:06:30]  You kind of like Ray's.  I see where he's going with it.  I see where he's going.  He's got a decent concept.  I think it's a little too long, though.  All right, here we go.  Ray the intern.  Some guys have a hard time finding love.  All right, hold on two seconds.  He loves his voice because it sounds just like Steve.  That's why Steve likes this guy's voice.  You would totally sell him the voice.  Got a great voice.  Great voice.  Is some like it.  It sounds like you. 
[02:07:00]  I don't think so.  A little bit.  Oh, my God.  It sounds so much like you.  Play it again.  I have a hard time.  Whatever he says, then you say it right afterwards.  Just give a sentence.  Some guys have a hard time finding love.  Some guys have a hard time finding love.  That's exactly the same kind of tone.  There's a little difference, but same tone that your S pronunciation, find diction.  I was just trying to throw the kid a bone. 
[02:07:30]  I'm not.  All right, here we go.  Some guys have a hard time finding love.  37th.  This is the last relationship going down.  And I was going to leave the one.  I knew that I missed her.  I don't know what I said.  I'm going to dust off the soul.  I said, you're a self-mine.  I'm 1893.  You're not going to be doing shots when you're first.  You're outside playing one more game.  A fuse ball.  It starts.  You're at the bar waiting.  All you had to do was turn and say, I'm going to throw the fuse ball. 
[02:08:00]  I'm going to run.  Switch right there.  That's it.  I'm going to fuck you.  Rub them up.  So, there's a wonderful thing for us to do.  Is that you cannot say you're done.  You'll never forget what we're doing.  Because when it just happened, it didn't matter. 
[02:08:30]  So when you finally meet that perfect girl, you just know it.  So a girl will come across the fence on Sunday.  They'll start talking and hear you can be in stuff that I play.  Unfortunately, in several nights, it was the same way to that tour.  Perfect girl, in the morning, you're in.  So I'm doing this for all to the good way.  I'm going to have a good day.  I'm going to have a good day for you. 
[02:09:00]  I'm going to have a good day for you because you've got to stay on the road.  Because she drives crazy.  I don't have to wear my head.  I don't have anything to do with the car.  I'm going to have a good day for you.  My body looks like you're starting to be strong.  I'm going to have a good day for you.  Yes, it does.  I don't have anything to do with you.  I'm seriously interested.  She deserves plenty of trongers to the nerds. 
[02:09:30]  I don't know.  What do you seem to zit you in?  You rub.  That's right�ony.  I'm going to need you to tie on a tracks normal day.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's not hurting your whole genius than five minutes.  I'm going to have something to love today.  I guess what?  It's probably going to be a good day for you guys.  Uh, all right. 
[02:10:00]  Problem.  What?  Most people could not hear the trailer.  Why?  I don't know.  Phasing.  No, I don't think so.  Uh, we can't hear it.  Can't hear the trailer.  Can't hear it.  It sounds fine.  Song's all fucked up.  Can barely hear this idiot's voice track on the song.  In the headphones it sounds fine, but in here it sounds like it's bouncing off all the walls and coming out of one speaker.  Uh, Matt from Long Island, uh, calling in saying can't hear anything. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, it's out of phase.  How's that?  Hi, Matt.  Burned it the same way for the gun.  I couldn't hear it, huh?  No, not at all.  Well, thank God it wasn't that long.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Thing went on forever and, uh, no one heard it.  So we pretty much just played a song for you, I guess, Matt, huh?  It was the movie.  Yeah, I heard the song and then it sounded like, uh, you know when the BlackBerry goes off?  Yeah.  It sounded like somebody was talking on a BlackBerry or something like that in the background.  How did that happen?  I don't know.  All right, well, is Ray going to be here tomorrow?  Yeah, Ray will be here tomorrow.  All right, we'll replay Ray's tomorrow. 
[02:11:00]  Good one, Ray.  We'll fix that, right?  Jesus.  Ray the intern screwed up the show today for everybody.  Thank you.  All right, Matt.  Later.  How is that?  That is weird.  If we can hear it through the headphones, fine.  I don't get that.  No, there's no, there's no, there's no logic to that because I burned it the same way everything  else got burned.  So it should, it should be okay.  But now I, now I don't get it.  All right.  Maybe he did something wrong.  Huh?  Maybe Ray did something wrong.  Mm-hmm.  You thinking? 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  All right, why don't we break and we'll, uh, make sure the rest of these are good.  All right, can you do that really fast?  Yeah.  We got four more Opie and Anthony movie trailers to get to.  Yes.  We got Tara Reid audio.  We got a lot of, uh, stuff still to get to today.  And on the guest, uh, sheet today we have, uh, oh, look at that.  We have, uh, wow.  Who do we have?  Nobody.  We don't even.  Well, it says.  We don't even have guests listed that will end up blowing us off later on in the program. 
[02:12:00]  I see a name there.  Is James Simmons coming by?  Bill Burr is not a guest anymore.  Bill Burr.  Well, he's written in the guest section.  He's a featured player.  Featured player.  One of those guys that stand in the background.  I'm doing six episodes on Will and Grace.  That's what this is like.  You're the background guy on an SNL sketch.  Is that it?  Featured player.  Jay Moore.  When Jay Moore, I see Jay Moore pop up as, they were doing some, um, 20,000 Leagues Under  the Sea sketch.  And it's Jay standing in some, like, pirate-looking shirt in the background, not uttering a word the 
[02:12:30]  whole time.  Bill utters.  Lots of words.  I'm standing next to Conan O'Brien.  You ever see him in the background?  No.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  He's, like, 10 feet tall.  Conan O'Brien's in the background of a lot of skits in the, uh, in the older.  It was, like, the late 80s, early 90s.  Yeah, in the older SNLs.  Let's say hi to Selena in College Point.  Selena.  Hey, I wanted to say that I don't understand why these dicks didn't hear anything, because  I heard it perfectly clear, driving on the 495.  Yeah, it all depends.  Some people hear it, some don't. 
[02:13:00]  Depends on, uh, your configuration.  Depends on...  I just want to say, good job, Steve.  Uh, Selena, what kind of hardware you got?  You got a, what?  Delphi?  Um, I have a...  Roadie 2?  Roadie 2.  Ah.  Roadie 2.  All right.  Maybe that's what the deal is.  I don't know.  All right, Selena, thank you.  Thanks.  Well, we're going to figure it out after these fine promos. 
[02:13:30]  We've really got to stop taking breaks.  Phil Byrne's studio.  He refuses to eat.  We've got a Starbucks run happening.  We've got to have some apple cake.  As we speak, every once in a while, Anthony just gets very excited and yells that he needs  a low-fat apple cake.  Right.  And evidently demands everyone around one half one, too.  Everyone needs to share in the deliciousness that is. 
[02:14:00]  Like a big shot, throwing his money around.  I got a five here, huh?  Come on.  Enough for all of you.  Everyone.  I'm allergic to apples, so I had to go with the, uh, the low-fat blueberry muffin.  Allergic to apples?  Who's a...  What?  Exactly.  Are you eating a tangerine?  It's a, uh, it's a clementine.  They're in season.  It's a clementine.  You buy them by the box in the supermarket.  They're delicious.  Why do you always, like, throw the, like, the fruit from one hand to the other?  Yeah, you do that with everything.  Blueberries?  That's like Big A, tapping his fingers?  Yeah.  Oh, I got my own little taps and things I have to do. 
[02:14:30]  Sure.  I got to change the fruit in my hands 18 times and then eat one.  I'm not a counter.  You don't count?  Mm-mm.  It just feels good to do that a couple times.  I don't know.  It's like a slinky.  Slinky.  Yeah.  He slinkies his clementine.  I was getting to you.  Why are you abusing me?  Why won't you take Anthony's offer up on a little low-fat apple cake from Starbucks?  Because it sounds like it sucks.  No, it is so good.  You know what?  My deal is if I'm going to have a cake, I'm going to have a fucking cake.  I'm not going to get low-fat ice cream, you know? 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, I hear you on that.  I would have gone for the regular apple cake, but somebody, whoever turned me on to the low-fat apple cake,  it might have been a little Jimmy Norton.  They don't have regular apple cake.  They don't have it.  That's the beauty of Starbucks.  But you'll never know it's low-fat.  Because of the man-made chemical they stuck in there.  Right.  No, they just say it's low-fat, but if you've got a little-  It's not.  One of those scientist people to, like, look into it, there's a lot of fat in that.  A lot of fat.  Of course.  Mm-hmm.  I was never into the Drake's cakes and that shit.  No?  No. 
[02:15:30]  You know what I mean?  Yankee doodles.  Yeah.  I like the Yankee doodle.  Twinkies are horrendous.  Yeah, those are bad.  It should be discontinued.  Yodels.  I like the yodel.  You pick the chocolate off the outside, and you're left with the chocolate swirly cake and cream.  It's wonderful.  Can you think of a dessert that's more man-made than Hostess, those little Hostess pies that we used to get as kids?  The apple pie?  Yeah, those are pretty gruesome.  Completely man-made.  You know what I never had the balls to eat?  One of those pink snowballs? 
[02:16:00]  Oh, those are awful.  The coconut marshmallow-y snowball.  And it's got- I used to have to rip the covering off if I would come across one.  I don't know why I would buy one and then throw half of it away when I could just get a piece of cake, but somehow I'd be in possession of one of those.  Maybe someone would share.  And I'd have to rip that marshmallow stuff off the top and just eat the chocolate cake because it's not even like a food product.  It's like some form of rubber or plastic.  I just look at that like, who the fuck is buying those?  We used to talk about candy bars. 
[02:16:30]  Like, who buys a Fifth Avenue?  And every time you go into CVS, they're sitting at Clark Bars.  Fifth Avenue.  You don't understand a Hershey bar, right?  When was the last time you saw somebody walking down the street, biting at Fifth Avenue?  Fifth Avenue.  They've been there since 1979.  It's just the same one.  What an awful candy bar.  From the original delivery truck.  Or like those ones, like, they'll come out with a new candy bar and they have this huge ad campaign.  Like, remember O'Henry?  O'Henry, yeah.  When that first came out, O'Henry, the candy bar, that's mostly nuts too. 
[02:17:00]  And they have this stupid, like, cartoon character running around to the point and made you want to buy it.  They're like, you know, fuck it.  Fuck that.  They have not had one commercial in 30 years, but they still have that candy bar.  There isn't really a good candy bar that's come out in the past 50 years.  I think everything that people eat has been around forever.  Or a Hershey bar.  I like the Nestle Crunch bars.  Those are great.  Chocolate with the little Rice Krispie crunches in them.  A little crunch to it.  I like Twix.  I think that was the last good one that came out. 
[02:17:30]  With caramel in it.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Steve, you got the movie trailers?  We're going to get into Nougat in a minute.  Nougat.  What is Nougat?  What is that shit?  What is it constructed of?  I don't know.  Worst Nougat, Three Musketeer bar.  The only way you can eat those is the miniature ones.  If you have a whole one, I don't know.  Don't vomit before you're done.  All of a sudden, it's swirling in your belly.  The Nougat.  The bulimic candy bar of choice.  You feel the weight of that Nougat. 
[02:18:00]  Are you tired of sticking your finger down your throat?  Take two bites of a full-size Three Musketeer.  And that dumpster could not be close enough.  Oh, is that horrible?  Nougat.  What the fuck?  Really fast.  Tara wants to say hi.  Tara.  Hey, guys.  How you doing this morning?  Tara Reid.  Hey, Tara Reid.  Guests.  It's good to talk to you guys again.  You guys have no guests in the show.  I kind of think safe.  I figure I'll call and say hi to Ray and Don Imus.  How you guys doing today?  We're doing good, Tara.  Where's Ray Romano? 
[02:18:30]  Are you going to help the bit and have Ray?  I don't understand.  This alone is not going to cut the mustard.  So if you're not going to help me, I'm going to punch out.  Well, that's Tara Reid.  That's great.  We did that the other day.  What am I going to say?  Well, it's the same guy.  He was feeling so good about his new bit that he thought he was going to be a recurring role.  No.  Not a recurring role on the show.  Not doing it. 
[02:19:00]  Rob wants to know if any of us have ever had a payday.  That's another one.  Who the fuck is buying a payday?  And what about those Mary Janes?  They still doing the Mary Janes thing?  Oh, those were awful.  You used to get them for Halloween.  That's what I remember.  Yeah, Mary Janes.  It was some kind of peanut butter, rip your fillings out candy.  Absolutely awful.  Heath.  A Heath Bar.  I actually had one of them.  They're not bad.  Really?  I don't think I've ever had one.  No.  There's like a top five that everybody, no one goes outside of like Hershey Bar. 
[02:19:30]  Hershey Bar is the top.  I think Butterfinger is the bottom one.  Well, let's go for the low top five today.  Oh, is that what we're doing?  The topic?  The low top five.  Top, the worst five candy bars of all time.  Someone says, how about the salted nut roll?  Oh, yeah.  That's horrendous.  What are you talking about?  It's almost like a candy bar was supposed to be built around it if you went to the factory.  It looks like, this is the inner workings.  All the goodness has been stripped from this. 
[02:20:00]  You know what happened there?  The chocolate machine broke down that day, so they're like, ah, just sell it like it is.  Pump them out.  See if they buy this shit.  Hey, this ain't bad.  Yeah, a whole fucking run went through without getting chocolate coating, and one guy bit  it and went, I bet this would sell.  Send this up to marketing.  It's like one of those shitty projects you did when you were like in kindergarten, you  made shit out of macaroni and glued it to a piece of paper.  They did that with like peanuts.  Yeah, it's a peanut shit log.  All right, we're going to come up with the five worst candy bars of all time. 
[02:20:30]  But first, it's Opie and Anthony movie trailers.  We move on with Rick and Phoenix.  What's this one about there, Steve-o?  This is, um, hold on.  You're looking at the track listing.  The Grizzly Man by Rick and Phoenix.  Oh, he took the, um, oh, I bet it's about Steve.  Yeah, he took, uh, he took a bunch of those Jetsons drops and a bunch of drops from the  show and mixed it in with the trailer for Grizzly Man, that documentary about the guy  who got eaten.  And you wrote, could be better, decent concept, though.  You're, you're really tough.  You're like the tough teacher in school.  He is, he's like the American Idol guy. 
[02:21:00]  I'm trying to be nice about him, but I'm, I guess.  Trying to be nice.  There's not one nice comment, really.  No.  I'm sure there is.  Even, even your nice comments are followed by something else.  He hates them all.  No, you know what?  I appreciate the fact that they're actually putting effort into them, but then I have to  look like this one.  Take points away.  Good music, clips make no sense.  Well, that, yeah, of course.  If you've got a, if you've got some great music that's trying to set a mood and then  you've got a bunch of drops that are completely incoherent, then you don't deserve credit  for coming up with a coherent trailer.  All right.  Let's try it out here.  It's Rick and Phoenix. 
[02:21:30]  That's, that's right.  There you go.  Oh my God.  What did I do?  Oh, I'm sorry.  There you go.  My mistake.  He made me hate that song.  For 13 years, Timothy Treadwell lived among the grizzly bears in the Alaskan wilderness.  During that time, he shot over 100 hours of videotape.  Until 2003, when he was killed by one of the bears he had sworn to protect. 
[02:22:00]  I absolutely am a morbid creep.  Well, I'm here with one of my favorite bears.  Look at you.  He's been with me for over a decade and he's been my good friend.  Oh, he's a big bear.  He's a big bear.  A very big bear.  Wow.  Ah, you know what?  All right.  I'll, I'll totally, I just.  When you spend a lot of time with bears day after day, there's a calling that makes you  want to come in and spend more time in the world.  I came here and protected the animals as best I could.  In fact, I'm the only protection for these animals out here. 
[02:22:30]  You know, yeah, yeah, we did.  He was a little, a little anxious.  Timothy conquered.  You know, they're, they're very, you know, they're very eager.  Some of them over eager.  He tended to want to become a bear.  Asshole.  Most times I'm a kind warrior out here.  Occasionally I am challenged.  And in that case.  And he's running like he's doing a midair leap.  The kind warrior must, must, must become a samurai.  What are they, um, prongs?  I think he had lost sight of what was really going on. 
[02:23:00]  He got what he was asking for.  He got what he deserved.  I will die for these animals.  I will die for these animals.  I will die for these animals.  Okay, terrific.  And the longhorns are gone.  And the drovers are gone.  The Comanches are gone.  This is my life.  This is what I do.  I love it.  Geronimo's gone.  He says, if I don't come back, it's what I want.  I certainly was.  It is great.  Well, there, but unfortunately you can't really play the audio because there's, um, news announcer 
[02:23:30]  audio.  And that's my story here.  For me, Timothy Treadwell.  It's a kind warrior.  It's a kind warrior.  That lost me.  Yeah, it just completely lost me, this guy.  The concept, you know, I got to give credit to Steve.  The concept was definitely decent, but, uh...  It was too long and he sort of, he had it like about 20 seconds in and then...  Was any of that audio actually from that Grizzly Bear movie? 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was a lot of it.  Does he really talk to the bear like that?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, I got to go see that.  That was essentially the trailer for the movie and then he just dropped in, you know, random  quotes and then...  You're a big bear!  Yeah!  And that movie fell flat because they didn't play the audio of him getting eaten at the  end of it.  If they would have played that, that movie would have been the talk of the country.  Dummies.  They'll have a director's cut.  No.  The stupid guy that was filming the whole thing told the lady that had the tape to destroy  it.  That stinks. 
[02:24:30]  Exactly.  Ever have a Zagnut?  A Zagnut.  That's up there.  You know, there's another real bad one.  A Marathon Bar.  Remember that?  Marathon?  Marathon Bar.  Like, their big hook was it takes forever to eat because there's so much gooey, disgusting  shit.  What is this, Travis?  Yeah, it's pretty bad.  It's a list of candy bars.  Oh, and the top ones?  You ever have a Charleston Chew?  Yes.  All right, here we go.  Oh, and you're supposed to stick it in the refrigerator and that made it better.  Right.  No, it doesn't.  Charleston Chew is chewy and louie. 
[02:25:00]  Here we go.  But not too chewy.  According to this dumb website, the top ten candy bars of all time, are you ready for number  ten?  The Hundred Grand.  Oh.  Number nine, Payday.  Stop.  Number eight, Dove Chocolate Bar.  What?  Isn't that ice cream?  That's for, like, pregnant chicks.  Number seven.  That didn't even make sense.  Bar None.  Bar None?  No.  I've never heard of it.  Number six, Twix.  I like the Twix.  The Twix, very good. 
[02:25:30]  Number five, top candy bars of all time.  Kit Kat.  Love Kit Kats.  Good stuff.  Number four, the Reese's Peanut Butter Cups Inside Out.  Is that the peanut butter's on the outside?  Yeah, these were limited edition.  Limited edition, people.  The peanut butter's on the outside.  It's on the outside.  It's on the outside, people.  It's insane.  Look, I'm unwrapping one here.  I got peanut butter on my fingers. 
[02:26:00]  I got peanut butter on my fingers, people.  Be dialing.  Be dialing.  The peanut butter, it's crazy.  Anthony, we've already sold 40 of these.  I'm telling you, we are moving.  They're moving, people.  You've got to be dialing now.  Get it on stretch, Patty.  If you can't afford it now, get it on the stretch, Patty.  That fucking lunatic.  Where did he go?  He was perfect. 
[02:26:30]  Here we go.  Number three, the Snickers bar.  And you get a McGuire rookie card.  We'll give you a McGuire rookie card, because there's 85 gazillion out there now.  Certificate.  What was that guy's name?  Don West.  Don West, yeah.  He dropped off the face of the earth.  He went to announce wrestling.  He was doing the wrestling thing.  And he was so good.  He had a buzz going about him with that fucking shopping network. 
[02:27:00]  Right.  And he just...  Who was that other one?  He got busted for just being completely full of shit.  The one-bedroom apartment.  I owe you $800,000 for my one-bedroom apartment.  And he would never say what the fuck he was saying, what he was selling.  You just take out ads.  You put them in the papers.  For what?  We'll tell you how to set the ads up, how to place them in papers, and the money will  be rolling in. 
[02:27:30]  And they got the testimonials from the people.  I made $6,000 in the last 20 minutes.  I've never had this happen in my life.  I don't know.  I got every color lipstick.  I'm on my period.  I'm still happy.  And then there are the people that...  And he was just paying them.  Of course.  I think he was selling, like, soap in ads in newspapers, and somehow you're going to  make six figures.  Yeah, what are you selling in these ads?  Because he never told you what he's selling. 
[02:28:00]  It's just the ads themselves that you're taking out, and money's rolling in.  It's like those real estate ads, where it's like, no money down.  You don't need money.  You don't need a house.  You don't need credit.  What you do is you buy these houses from people, and then sell them.  And people are like, I bought and sold my first apartment building and cleared $85,000.  I had no credit.  And you're just picturing...  Is this guy...  Yeah.  Could I buy your house?  I have nothing.  But I'll buy it from you, and I'll pay you when I sell it. 
[02:28:30]  Okay!  And people are just saying okay to this.  Because that was the guy's plan.  No, you know it's bullshit, because everyone...  Any time anybody's got to be crazy, like running around with question marks all over your sport  coat, like, it's fucking unreal!  The government's handing out money!  You could get a government grant to learn how your telephone works!  And they're handing money out!  And he's being chased by government agents in the commercial in fast motion...  With their briefcases.  With their briefcases, and he's got question marks on. 
[02:29:00]  That guy is truly an ass.  Oh, what a dolt.  All right.  He's going to get caught with kiddie porn.  Of course he is.  The top candy bars of all time.  Silly logical ending to that.  Sell kiddie porn for money!  Number three.  Let's go, yeah.  Number three is the Snickers bar.  Ah!  That's always great, because they got you to really think that that's a good substitute  for a meal.  Yeah, they've been...  Oh, yeah, they've been doing that on the commercials.  Yeah.  Yeah, when I get...  I buy into it. 
[02:29:30]  It fills you up.  Snickers really satisfies.  All right.  Ah, the second best candy bar of all time.  What is that, Anthony?  That's the original Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.  Ah, yes.  Oh, the classic.  Chocolate on the outside.  Yes.  Absolutely.  They got two bars in the top five.  Yeah.  Good old Reese's.  Isn't that wonderful?  I never heard of the fourth one.  Yeah.  The fourth one.  Nah.  Not at all.  Limited dish.  And the number one candy bar of all time is... 
[02:30:00]  Yes.  I can't read it here.  What is it?  Is that blurted out?  Oh, get Uncle Sam to pay your bills.  Here's the guy.  That's him.  Right there.  Here's the guy right here.  Free money.  Get Uncle Sam to pay your bills.  The screen there.  With the question marks.  He's got one right on his cock.  What is that about?  How big is it?  And what is he trying to say?  That government programs will pay you money to do, like, nothing.  To do nothing. 
[02:30:30]  Here's a good one.  Number 14, the Milky Way.  Yeah.  That's like when you couldn't afford...  Like, the Snickers is like the Z28.  The Milky Way is just like...  There's no air conditioning or power steering.  I got to call you out on something, though.  But when you couldn't afford...  Weren't they, like, the same price?  Or are you trying to tell me that...  No, the Z28 was the top of the line.  No, I understand that.  But the candy bar thing.  You said, like, when you couldn't afford, what, the Snickers, you would go with the Milky Way?  Oh, they're the same price.  I mean, it's more like...  It's a bare-bones Snickers. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  I was just thinking...  Thanks for getting so technical and sucking all the comedy out of that.  Is the Snicker bar, what, 10 cents more than the Milky Way?  But you can't afford it, so you got to go with the Milky Way?  And then there was the big campaign.  Who can remember the Mounds Almond Joy campaign?  Oh, yes.  Sometimes you feel like a nut.  Sometimes you don't.  Right?  It was the same bar.  Only one of them had two little fucking chintzy peanuts laid on top of it under the chocolate. 
[02:31:30]  Here's a theory I have about the crackle.  No one has ever eaten a full-size one.  No, they only come in the little miniatures.  Something about that red packaging.  It's just too much.  And the plain white letters.  You're like, that sucks.  But when it's a little, small, cute one, you're like, all right, you pop it in your mouth.  Surrounded by a Mr. Goodbar.  All right, where were we?  We were interrupted because Nathaniel got a question mark guy on the screen.  Yes.  Oh, we were doing an Opie and Anthony movie trailer.  If you have to have something on your website that says this is not a scam, do you see that?  Yeah. 
[02:32:00]  Look, free money to pay your bills.  Keep out of debt forever.  Big red letters.  This is not a scam.  It says 10,000 little-known government money programs that give out grants, direct payments,  and other free money to people of all ages and all incomes.  I heard these are grants.  These are grants that maybe have been given out once in history, and he's trying to make  it sound like if you file the proper paperwork that, uh-oh, there's a problem.  Oh, no.  Uh-oh.  What happened? 
[02:32:30]  Went to Starbucks.  For Starbucks.  Went to for Starbucks.  You went to four Starbucks?  Yeah, I really did.  Well, you could do that in New York City.  Yeah, for four of them.  Four, four Starbucks is on the same block.  They're like next to each other.  No low-fat blueberry or apple cakes anywhere.  Yeah, I didn't want to come back with the wrong thing and spend your fancy money.  You know something?  You are the first person we've ever sent out that has not completed this mission.  Yeah, I stink.  There's a lot more than four Starbucks in Manhattan.  I'm just saying that. 
[02:33:00]  You're going to keep the C-Note, or?  Do you want it back?  Do you want anything else?  I didn't want to come back with the wrong thing.  Nah, I don't want it.  Suddenly, Bill, I've lost my appetite.  Yeah, I'm not very hungry anymore.  I'll just take my green back.  It's sort of a pattern, you know?  Hey, I got something for everybody.  Yeah?  Granola!  Ugh.  Ugh.  No?  All right.  It's the sound of that bag.  It's the sound of the first time I've ever had my money handed back to me. 
[02:33:30]  Thanks.  Thanks.  All right.  Good job.  Thumbs up, my friend.  Back to the movie trailers.  This next one stinks, by the way.  I saw Bill Tip, one of the interns, the other day.  Pretty good, too.  Out in the hallway.  You didn't think I saw that?  I was walking by.  Like, Dad, would you throw him a tan or something?  No.  Somebody out in the hallway in front of the bathroom.  You're like, yeah, keep that.  That doesn't sound good.  It made us look really bad.  No, I mean, tipping an intern in front of the bathroom. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, yeah.  I was, oh, wait, maybe I'm wrong.  I'm trying to help you out, Bill.  I said, keep it, and he refused to.  Yeah, I saw he was, like, refusing.  Yeah.  He didn't keep it?  No, he didn't.  He came back with all the change.  It made us look really bad, though.  It was like a prison thing.  You know, you can't owe anybody a favor.  Yeah, you're not allowed to.  But you even offering makes us look bad.  I'm a nice guy.  I'm sorry.  Makes us look bad.  Trying to spread the love.  What is a bun bar?  That sounds like something Norton would be into. 
[02:34:30]  A bun bar?  The chocolate drops out from between two creamy buns.  Well.  Right on your face.  Lemonade comes out the front.  It's all.  Getting back to the candy bar thing, and then we'll do the movie trailer thing.  Yeah.  Well, Mounds is one of the worst candy bars of all time.  Mounds.  It's that coconut shit.  Bun bars, worse than Mounds.  I've never heard of it.  And then Zagnut, worse than Bun Bars and Mounds.  The Sky Bar is worse than Zagnut, Bun Bars, and Mounds. 
[02:35:00]  But amazing, not even amazing.  Amazing M&M Crunchy Candy Bar, worse than Sky Bar, Zagnut, Bun Bars, and Mounds.  What's the number one awful candy bar?  Of all time?  Awful?  It's a take five.  Take five.  It's a take five.  The reason I'm telling you all this is it got no ratings.  No.  Like, no one has eaten one of these things.  It's a Dave Brubeck album cover that they just dip it in chocolate. 
[02:35:30]  It's chocolate-covered cardboard.  Has anyone ever had a take five?  It's the worst candy bar of all time.  No, never.  Send the intern out for a take five, Anthony.  Oh!  So we can try the worst candy bar of all time, according to this website.  How about a Clark Bar?  No, let's go.  How old is a Clark Bar that it's named Clark?  Like, it named it after the hip guy at the candy factory.  Clark.  There's a name that really just fell by the wayside.  Yeah.  There was just too many dorks with that fucking name. 
[02:36:00]  Hey, Clark.  Clark.  They named a candy bar after it.  That's awful.  Is that a peanut butter crunchy thing?  Why is Al Roker starting to look like an old, retarded kid?  Because when you're that fat and you lose all that weight, your head never shrinks.  Yep.  Something's going on there with him.  Big mongoloid head.  All right.  We're going to get a take five bar.  Looks like an old Barry Bonds.  There you go.  Wow.  All right.  Are we going to get a couple of candy bars? 
[02:36:30]  Take five.  I want to sample a take five.  I also want a Zagnut and a Clark Bar.  He's not going to find a Zagnut and a Clark Bar?  How about a Mr. Good Bar?  Get a Fifth Avenue.  Mr. Good Bars aren't bad.  Get a Fifth Avenue.  How about a...  Yeah, Clark Bar is down there.  Yeah.  The worst candy bars of all time as well.  Nestle Crunch coming in at 21.  That's really surprising.  Yeah, I had to pop that one up on the list a little more.  I like those.  Yeah.  You like the Peeps?  You ever eat a Peep around Easter? 
[02:37:00]  Hershey's Cookies and Creams.  Oh, Peeps are horrendous.  You don't like Peeps?  Peeps are great.  Oh, I can only have them fresh right out of the goddamn little thing they come in.  Yeah.  I like those.  Sugar covered like chicken abortion that you're eating?  It's just sugar.  Inside is like a marshmallow-y thing.  Outside is just sugar.  But they're great when they're completely fresh, brand new.  All right.  And the one thing I hate around Halloween, the candy corn.  Can we do the movie trailers, get this out of the way for today? 
[02:37:30]  Ah, yes.  The next movie trailer, where did Steve go?  He gave up on us?  This is from Carmine from the Bronx.  He went to go get some candy bars.  He left his vehicle right there, though.  He walked.  Movie trailer by Carmine from the Bronx.  This is the second attempt from Carmine.  Carmine's been ragging me on instant feedback all morning.  Play mine.  Play mine.  It's really good.  Play mine.  Well, according to Steve, he says in parentheses, so fucking dumb, worth playing just to smash.  Wow. 
[02:38:00]  Here's Carmine from the Bronx.  I only listened to him for a couple of minutes.  That was all, I swear.  Just a couple of minutes.  Just a couple of minutes.  The Catholic League is praising Infinity Broadcasting for canceling the Opie and Anthony show.  The company pulled the plug on the popular syndicative program after the shop jocks encouraged a couple to have sex in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral.  The Catholic League has promised now to petition the SBC to drop its investigation. 
[02:38:30]  Welcome to New York City.  Circle Line Tour, $30.  Handsome cab through Central Park, $50.  Sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral, priceless.  I'm so glad Letterman gets the big laughs over our demise.  Holy crap.  I didn't realize how much of a laugh he got over that line at the time.  And he worked for the same company.  That's what I always found weird.  We did something so outrageous they fired us, but it was fodder for David Letterman. 
[02:39:00]  Fair game.  For a good week or two after that.  I only cried two times in my whole life.  I don't even remember the first time.  But the second time I was on the New England thruway.  And all I heard was...  What is it?  Your mother's box.  I think that's him interjecting.  But I can't really tell.  This isn't a movie trailer.  Yeah, we're goofed, by the way.  It has two and a half minutes left.  We're bailing.  Carmine, you are so bad. 
[02:39:30]  You have no talent whatsoever in putting together anything creative.  You know he's screaming at his mother right now.  Ma, can you believe what they're saying?  Don't touch the hair.  Oh, Carmine.  You know, I might not be able to put these together, but I could dance down at the disco.  Every weekend.  Should we play the rest of it now?  I work at the paint store and dance at the disco.  Want to play the rest of it now that we have acknowledged how bad it is?  Let's hear where he was going. 
[02:40:00]  Your mother's box.  And I was coming off the exit and tears were rolling out of my eyes.  And I put my finger to them and I licked them.  And they were salty.  And I said, I'm not going to school anymore because I have nothing to listen to.  Mom!  I love the Lord!  I have to do this now!  Mom!  I...  In this world. 
[02:40:30]  You mean, I'm doing a fucking promo and now I gotta play clips from the show?  Who the fuck do these people think they are?  They're back.  Asshole.  Blue, dickhead.  What?  Carmine.  Holy crap.  Carmine.  He just emailed in.  He goes, geez, I give up.  Good.  Thank you.  That's exactly the point.  Carmine.  Holy crap. 
[02:41:00]  This is a minute to go.  A minute left.  There's things that happen on this show.  You want to play stuff from the listeners that is just plain brilliant because everyone  could enjoy it along with your fine radio host.  Then there's stuff that is so bad you gotta play it so you can goof on it.  Then there's things that are so bad that everyone gets uncomfortable and there's no reason to  play it at all.  We're at that point with this thing.  Yep.  Right?  Yeah.  I don't know where he's going with any of it.  He's commenting on his own movie trailer.  Bill, you want to hear more?  No! 
[02:41:30]  Anthony?  No.  No.  It's so bad.  We started talking about this in the office before the show.  You know, if you're the pilot and you know you're going to land this perfectly, you wouldn't  even use it to your advantage though.  You'll see some hot chick and...  Hurry!  Slip my cock!  Seven feet.  It'll help my concentration.  Start making some deals.  Hey!  Take the tension away.  Pretty tense up there, man.  Pretty tense.  I think I could do this, bud.  Holy crap.  Okay.  Thank you.  I was trying to keep the gag going.  I can't even keep the gag going. 
[02:42:00]  Uh, instant feedback coming through.  Probably the worst one ever.  Uh, this shit is horrible.  Turn it off.  This sucks.  Wow.  The next one is just as bad.  It's by Justin.  You can't be just as bad.  You write good music.  Clips make no sense.  Yeah.  I think this is another one of those that's just...  Are we going to end up on an up note today?  What's the last one is, um...  Last one had some context to it.  Yeah.  Oh, great.  Some context.  Here's Justin's opening Anthony movie trailer.  In a time when censorship rules the land... 
[02:42:30]  You can't say that now.  ...and originality no longer exists.  All of the radio rips me up.  One radio program dares to tell the truth to the American people.  Fuck you, asshole.  Opium and Anthony and pleasure for me always.  Oh.  Starring.  Opium.  Because I don't know what was going on that day, fuck face.  Anthony.  I'm getting dressed up.  I need some stats.  And featuring Jim Norton. 
[02:43:00]  I have the metabolism of a glacier.  I have no fucking idea.  Crap, you're right.  It's not real.  Holy shit, are you kidding me?  You take the young lad into the bathroom stall with you.  I should be milked into a bucket and then beaten with a belt until I do a sit-up across my fat white stomach.  Why did you kill me? 
[02:43:30]  Shut the fuck up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Did you shut up?  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up, bitch.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Opie and Anthony.  Now playing on Select XM Radio's channel 202.  Well.  Oh, my God.  It kind of had some entertaining clips in there.  Yeah, they don't have like a movie.  No.  It wasn't like a movie thing, though. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  Carmine's back.  He says, I can't find good clips from the show to download.  Sorry, guys.  Our entire career is online somewhere to download.  Go to oavirus.com.  Everything we've ever done.  And you can't find clips from the show.  Carmine, I believe in you, man.  Send in another one.  Come on, Carmine.  You can do it.  You can do it, Carmine.  Come on, Carmine.  You know what the problem is?  Steve is waiting.  Yeah.  Your trailers are too short.  So we're not getting to what, you know, you're trying to say. 
[02:44:30]  I think.  Phil's on to something.  Yes.  Yeah.  Turn it into an epic.  No.  A trilogy.  Take your friends and go to the bridge and then think about it and make a new one.  I went to kill myself.  Let's see if we can end on an up note as far as these movie trailers go today.  This is Dan of the Dead.  His movie's called Steve from Yellowstone.  In an unforgiving world, something is out there. 
[02:45:00]  These nerd characters are like, you know, people lurking.  Wow.  Kelly, come on.  That's pretty good, dude.  That's amazing.  Waiting to strike when least expected.  All right.  You want to take some phone calls from us?  Yeah, let's see.  Yeah, yeah.  Definitely.  All right, let's see.  Wow.  A lot of callers that are very excited.  They want to go and see you guys, I guess.  All right.  Let's say hi to Steve in Yellowstone. 
[02:45:30]  Steve in Yellowstone.  Hey, Steve.  Ramone.  Yes, it's Ramone.  Finally, Steve from Yellowstone in his very own full-length feature film.  Ramone.  Star Wars is the faggot.  Witness the shock.  Exactly.  Coffee with booze does not matter.  Ramone.  Shut this heart up.  That's enough.  We've got to go.  Hey, it's really frightening.  Sounds like he had too much.  Sorry, Jordan.  Sounds like he had too much honey in his teeth.  Ramone.  Ooh, grab his faggot. 
[02:46:00]  All right.  Somebody didn't take their medication this morning.  Yeah, that's what it sounds like.  Witness the anger and insults.  This is a copyright problem because it is, you know, a matter of...  Ramone.  Bring me someone with talent.  What the fuck are you talking about, you fucking retard?  Yeah.  Have fun in Yellowstone, buddy.  Maybe you can sit on, like, you know, the old faithful and have it go up your ass, you  stupid piece of shit.  Ramone. 
[02:46:30]  Wow, pretty good.  Ramone.  Lou Graham has AIDS.  Oh, jeez.  What is wrong with you?  He got on again.  Ramone, bring me a cover band.  I swear to God, your collars are all in crack.  Ramone.  Tell this or this bit is tired.  He doesn't care.  Ramone.  Oh, they're the same color.  Over and over and over. 
[02:47:00]  This is Steve from Yellowstone again.  Ramone.  Ramone.  Stop.  Vader has AIDS.  He's very excited.  Steve, go ahead.  Steve, go ahead.  Steve.  So what?  What is with Ramone?  Hello.  Everyone loves Ramone. 
[02:47:30]  See it in the theater near you.  Liddy.  Liddy and Ramone?  Like, what the hell?  What?  Liddy.  I like that one.  That was good.  Dan of the Dead.  Steve from Yellowstone.  See, but we could have just played those clips and laughed our balls off.  I know.  It wasn't really the movie thing.  The guy's cheating by using hysterical clips.  You might have to make it Steve from Yellowstone promo.  You know that, right?  Oh, that one where he was laughing for like a minute and a half.  He couldn't even talk.  That wheezing laugh that he was doing. 
[02:48:00]  I tried to explain that to everybody I knew and I was just bombing with it trying to...  Can't.  Yeah.  Unexplainable.  And then he kept laughing.  People just...  Yeah.  All right.  There you go.  The latest movie trailers that came in over the weekend, right?  Oh, we got some Take Fives?  Ooh.  And some...  Huh?  We're still rounding up some more of them.  Oh, my God.  Let me see what a Take Five bar looks like.  Yeah, throw one over here.  We just need a piece. 
[02:48:30]  It's from Hershey's?  I'm not going to eat a whole one.  No, we just need a little...  Pretzels, caramel, peanuts, peanut butter, and milk chocolate.  Wow, this guy got fired.  This is everything.  The guy who came up with this got fired.  This is like everything.  Yeah, what if we take everything that sucks and covered it in chocolate?  Well, according to this website, this bar right here got...  Oh, good.  It comes in two halves, so...  Got no ratings.  You can maul it if you want a piece.  How is the Take Five?  I'm not a fan of peanut butter anyway. 
[02:49:00]  I hate it.  I love peanut butter.  But I'm trying to, like, be open-minded here.  The pretzel really takes away from the chocolate and the sweetness that it's supposed to have.  The pretzel ruins this.  That's what the problem is.  Yeah.  Other than that, I don't think it's that bad.  It wouldn't be bad, but it would be something else.  It would be a Reese's, I think.  Right?  They got to throw something in just so it isn't another candy bar.  How many ways can you mix chocolate and peanut butter and caramel together? 
[02:49:30]  It's not bad.  Let's throw a pretzel in it.  No, it's bad.  Yeah.  It takes a minute.  That pretzel starts working.  Yeah, stop eating it.  The salt starts taking over, right?  Don't eat anymore.  And then just let it, like, sit there.  The pretzel completely takes control.  The aftertaste is horrendous.  That is an awful candy bar.  All right.  There is the worst candy bar.  Take five.  Aftertaste.  Eat the whole thing.  No.  Oh, my God.  Eat the whole thing. 
[02:50:00]  It's horrible.  I'm not touching another bite.  What else you got there?  O'Henry.  An O'Henry.  Throw an O'Henry over this way.  Yeah, but O'Henry didn't get a bad rating, did it?  Again, gets two.  Where's the O'Henry?  Oh, 29th place out of 41 candy bars.  What's it got?  What the fuck is in this?  Let's see.  Peanut Caramel Fudge Bars in rich milk chocolate.  Isn't that what we just ate with that?  Less the fucking pretzel?  Isn't everything in rich milk chocolate? 
[02:50:30]  Let me see.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Let me try.  You're acting like this is the first time you've ever eaten an O'Henry bar.  I don't eat peanuts.  The peanuts in here are so stale and old.  Oh, isn't that awful?  This is like something you did in, like, off-track betting.  I had the exact in a one and a two.  It comes in a two and a one.  I didn't have a fucking box. 
[02:51:00]  Give me my O'Henry.  You get it out of one of those old...  Remember the cigarette things where you had to pull that knob?  Pull the handle?  The fucking thing comes down.  Oh, is that awful?  Wow, was that bad.  I can't get it out of my mouth now.  I need some lovely Godiva.  All right.  Oof.  I'm not even faking.  I can't look at this.  Wow.  That was even worse.  Oof.  All right, when we get back, we've got to talk about Dirk Jeter.  Receiving some hate mail. 
[02:51:30]  What else we got today?  Oh, the Demi Moore thing we didn't get into.  We didn't get into the Barbra Streisand thing.  Ugh.  Or the Dick Cheney thing.  Sharon Osbourne.  All right, we've got lots of show to do.  Stay there.  Golfing is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.  A true test of dexterity, skill, and, oh, seems to have landed in some dog mess.  Oh, not again.  Ramon, wash my balls. 
[02:52:00]  Hey, where's that candy bar that you just bit into, Anthony?  I threw them in the garbage.  What garbage fell?  Right here.  Let me see.  Okay.  Let me see. 
[02:52:30]  Come here.  They're wrapped in paper.  No, I just want to say it.  You want it?  No, I don't believe you.  Nathaniel, take this.  Bring it to the lab.  We'll get your rage.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Bring it to the lab.  Oh.  The Opie and Anthony lab.  I cannot get that out of my head.  I can't get that O. Henry.  Those peanuts were like the ones George Washington Carver didn't use during his experiments.  They put them in those bars and put them on the shelves.  I can't get it out of my teeth.  They were a prop on Archie Bunker sitting in a little ball next to his chair. 
[02:53:00]  That stupid chair of his.  All right.  Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher.  Ashton Kutcher.  There's something wrong with this guy, man.  He's one of the hottest things in Hollywood.  Oh, well, that's your opinion.  He's got the MTV cred.  He's friends with P. Diddy.  And he's marrying an older woman.  I don't get that.  I get the guy with the younger woman thing. 
[02:53:30]  Trust me, I get that.  Really?  I don't get the older woman with the younger guy.  I don't understand how it works that way.  It's a mommy thing.  It's a mommy thing.  There's nothing else that could be said about that relationship.  You want a mommy.  You didn't get enough attention from mommy.  And now you have one.  I mean, a lot of girls.  And you're fucking.  Yeah.  You're banging your mommy.  A lot of girls will agree that guys just get better with age. 
[02:54:00]  You've heard that many, many times in your life, right?  Yeah.  But you don't hear it about the women.  I think that's a euphemism for the rapture of your money.  Yeah.  You think?  Well, she's 42.  She's hot as shit, obviously.  Yeah, she's gorgeous.  But she's 42.  You know, I mean.  That's a ticking time bomb.  That's what I'm saying.  With a short fuse.  What do you got?  What's the shelf life on that?  Maybe another seven years?  Her chin starts dropping in about 47.  Starts getting that turkey look.  Oh.  He's 27.  Yeah.  He could be going out with like 20-year-olds.  He's 33. 
[02:54:30]  She'll be 65.  Does that work out?  No, it doesn't work out.  She might as well be.  You want to be 35 and your wife's going through hot flashes?  Well, speaking of which, because they had a whole bunch of examples of other couples.  That's what I'm getting at here.  And I just want to say this.  I think Rafe, even though his name is spelled Ralph.  Yeah.  Ralph Fiennes.  It's Rafe. 
[02:55:00]  Rafe Fiennes has got to be gay.  That is my opinion.  Wow.  He is 42 years old.  His wife is 61 years old.  You called him gay?  I think he'd have something to say about that, Opie.  Go ahead.  Go on.  Leave.  Leave.  I pardon you.  Oh.  He doesn't seem that upset.  He pardoned you for it.  Thank you.  What is he doing with a 61-year-old woman?  Fucking her?  No.  No, I don't even think there's sex in there.  Relationship.  An item since 1995 they met while performing Hamlet together. 
[02:55:30]  What was she playing?  His grandmother in the play?  Sorry.  That is absolutely a mother issue.  He needs somebody to be motherly to him, and it's nothing about sex or having fun together.  No, it's weird.  Being in a relationship.  They get a picture of the happy couple in the USA Today, and it's obviously an older picture  because Rafe Fiennes looks younger, and she already looks really old.  And this is not a recent picture showing that she's 61. 
[02:56:00]  How old is he?  He's 42.  She's 61.  And they met 10 years ago.  1995.  So maybe at the time it seemed like a good idea.  No, it's still fucked up.  32 and 51?  32.  32.  He could still bang an 18-year-old with a certain level of guilt, but he could still do it.  But instead he's going 51 at 32.  Now he's 42.  She's 61.  Maybe it's a fetish.  And then he has a lovely quote in there about, what does the quote say from Rafe? 
[02:56:30]  Rafe says, if two people have a strong connection and a strong bond, that's what's important.  Certainly in my life, age difference has not been a problem.  It just seems creepy, though, man.  You're walking around with a 61-year-old lady.  Here's my lady.  Awful butterscotch candies laying around her apartment.  Just a big candy theme thing.  Would you like a mint?  What about James?  A Rothschild.  Whatever those awful candies are called. 
[02:57:00]  Those old people candy.  Would you like a Rothschild?  What a Rothschild.  What?  Some licorice sticks.  Would you like some jelly in it?  Yeah.  Horrid candy.  Richard.  A Werther's.  Would you like a Werther's?  Yes, sir.  Yeah.  About the older woman thing.  One thing I've got to say is Jane Seymour.  I mean, she's a pretty much older woman.  And last I looked at her, she was pretty damn hot looking. 
[02:57:30]  I think Demi Moore's got the potential of being at least that hot when she gets older.  I mean, look at her now.  If I was that young and had somebody that hot.  Would you marry her, though?  Yeah.  Eventually, she's going to look like Goldie Hawn.  I'll let you put her in my back pocket.  All right.  She really held out on the facelift for a while, didn't she?  Yeah.  Before she finally did it.  Oh, Goldie?  Goldie.  Yeah.  She looks like an emaciated Angela Lansbury.  All right.  Well, they're married.  And you think she's going to try to have a kid for Ashton? 
[02:58:00]  That's what they're saying.  She's already pregnant, and that's why they're getting married.  And Bruce Willis just hangs around like...  Oh, he parties with him.  Yeah, he went to the wedding.  Laughing it up.  I think he likes to watch.  You think?  Yeah.  Watching what then?  Doing that hack look where he's got one eyebrow up.  One eyebrow up.  He kind of smirks his mouth over a little bit.  Smiles.  You think that's what he's doing, watching?  Let's go.  I wouldn't be anywhere around it. 
[02:58:30]  No.  Why would you go to their wedding?  Hey, this guy's half my age with a full head of hair.  There he is.  Banging out.  Banging my ex-wife.  Oh, this guy's laughing.  Chris, Kentucky, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, man?  Yeah, man.  Older woman's the only way to go, man.  I'm 26.  I've dated from 17 up to like 45.  Man, the older ones are the only way to go.  Marriage is a little far.  I will give you that.  I don't know about marriage.  Now, why are the older ones the way to go, sir?  Well, there's nothing I can't explain, man. 
[02:59:00]  And why did you call?  You can't explain it.  And according to Ben, who knows everything, Demi Moore had a miscarriage.  Even better.  That's one good thing.  Most of them, they've been through menopause and they can't get pregnant, so you can pop  your load in them and not worry about anything.  Well, that's a great trade-off.  Yeah, but you're thinking about fucking a 22-year-old when you're banging her.  Well, no, man.  The ones I've been with have been hot.  I mean, the hottest woman I ever had sex with was twice my age. 
[02:59:30]  And how old were you, eight?  I was 21.  21.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, man.  Let's go to Cobra from Wackbag.  Cobra, what's up?  Yeah, you guys have seen Swimming Pool.  You remember that scene where Charlotte Rampling is nude in the bed?  Yeah.  She's in her 60s in that movie.  And she looked like she was in her 60s.  I was not watching that movie for her.  That's for sure.  Yeah, it was right, but it came up, and I mean...  They were trying to sell, like, and blah, blah, whatever her name is, Charlotte Rampling 
[03:00:00]  is going to be nude in this movie, and she's in her 60s and completely nude and looking good.  Well, for 60, you've got to give it to her.  Oh, for 60, you've got to give it to her.  Dude.  That's what you want to hear.  When you are watching a movie where that other chick is running around naked in it,  and then they put that old broad on the bed like that, it makes it that much worse.  There might have been someone who's into old broads looking at that movie and sees her  on the bed and goes, all right, that's not bad.  But after looking at that other girl prancing around naked the whole movie, it was like 
[03:00:30]  the scene from The Shining, the woman getting out of the bathtub.  Oh, you're being too hard.  No.  No.  She looked like she was in her 60s.  Some guys are into the old chicks.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jimmy Norton.  Hey, it's Jimmy.  Jimmy.  How are you?  Hi, pal.  I'm sick.  Are you kidding?  Are you kidding?  What?  What happened?  You emailed me over the weekend saying that you might be coming down with something.  What is it?  I think it's strep throat.  I'm not sure. 
[03:01:00]  I'll just see the medic there.  There's a medic on set.  I'm going to see him and see the strep throat.  A medic on set?  Yeah, there is.  There's a fellow who kind of walks around.  Oh, that's got to be a great doctor.  It's the John Ritter Kloss.  Oh, God.  Oh, sorry.  There's a lull.  I threw it in there.  Is he doing a pratfall?  No, I think he's having a heart attack behind the shoulder.  All right.  Let's just finish the shoot. 
[03:01:30]  Hey, John.  What is it?  What do you got?  I think it's strep, man.  It really is sore.  Your throat?  How much bad hooker asshole have you ate?  Not that much, actually.  I've been pretty good.  Not that much.  Not that much.  How great is that?  That's like going to a different country.  You've got to get used to the water.  Yeah.  You've got to get used to the ass.  You've got to get used to the L.A. hooker ass.  Jimmy.  Don't eat the ass.  You're not taking care of yourself.  No, I am, man.  I'm just, you know, it's like everybody, you know, you're all crowded into a little area, 
[03:02:00]  and eventually there's like one person sick, and everybody gets sick, and, you know.  You're going to continue with the filming, obviously.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I believe that, you know, two hours after the hour today, I have to go, we're starting  the second one today.  Does that help your character?  To be sick and not be able to talk?  Well, no, not to not be able to talk, but you've told us he's kind of like the creepy  friend or whatever, right?  Yeah, I mean, he's kind of like a douchey character, but, you know, I don't know if it'll  help or hurt.  I mean, it can't be any worse than my acting normally is. 
[03:02:30]  I'm just so paranoid I'm going to get fired.  I'm obsessed with it.  Dude, the message board is going crazy.  I guess there are a few people, a few fans that went to the taping of the first show,  and they said you were killing.  Yeah, yeah, they said they were good.  I talked to a few other guys, but I'm still paranoid.  Jimmy's always paranoid.  Remember when he first started here?  He was always like, ah, I'm going to get rid of me.  You're always paranoid.  I know, I know.  I always worry.  You've got to have confidence, Jimmy.  I know.  You know how it is, man.  I get scared.  I'm sorry.  I'm going to get fucking booted. 
[03:03:00]  Did you find an apartment?  No, I'm still in a hotel.  You're in a hotel?  Dude, I looked at a place.  I've looked at places all week.  I went to a place two days ago, and it wasn't bad.  It was a little bit like I wasn't too sure if it was a good neighborhood.  I remember where we stayed after that shit hotel they put us in on Sunset, the Wilshire.  Yeah.  With the rooftop pool.  Yeah.  It was right around the corner from there, and I'm looking at the apartment, and I go  around back, and I see this car with fucking wow stickers all over it, and I'm like, what 
[03:03:30]  idiot would do that to their car?  And the guy's like, ah, she's a girl.  She works for the radio station, and it was fucking donkey sausage.  Oh, no.  Two doors down from stupid donkey sausage in her apartment.  So I might move in there.  No, huh?  No, I might.  I don't know.  I might.  It's $1,500 a month, and that's a lot of money.  What did you do with the other place?  Did you get any of your money back?  No, I don't know yet.  There's a lawyer dealing with that.  Oh, boy. 
[03:04:00]  Pending litigation.  And I went to a place that I wanted to see up in the Hollywood Hills.  It was a place that I really wanted, and the guy took it off the market.  But I guess the other guy couldn't come up with the money, so I finally went, and I'm  talking to him on the phone, and he's like, yeah, man, it just opened up.  So I'm like, all right, I'm going to go up and see him.  And it was really, I wanted this place so badly.  I'm on the phone with the guy, and he's trying to be funny.  He's like, yeah, man, this place has everything.  All you got to do is bring your toothbrush.  And I actually laughed when he said it, because I wanted him to like me so badly. 
[03:04:30]  I was like, oh, this place, this place must have everything.  I was really, really, really humiliating.  I fucking dressed up.  I put on, like, the watch that the boss gave me, and a collared shirt.  I wanted him to be responsible.  What a faggot.  And I went there, and it really was not in a good neighborhood.  It's like, you know, you get into a shitty neighborhood, and you start to see, like,  the plane signs for, like, medical places, like just community dental, and it's got a 
[03:05:00]  smiling, non-white face on the door.  You know what I mean?  Never the sign of a good dentist's office when it looks like a fucking 1920 piggy bank.  Oh, God.  Wow.  That's quite a visual there, Jimmy.  So how are the hookers treating you out there?  I haven't indulged much, man.  I really haven't.  I've been pretty good.  I'm just really sick today.  And I've been kind of staying away from that a little bit. 
[03:05:30]  You know, I got one massage, I think.  It was horrendous.  And she was embarrassed, and I couldn't get a rod.  It was really humiliating for both of us.  So I kind of became kind of staying away from that.  What's your wardrobe like?  A robe?  Dude, I'm right off Santa Monica.  You have no idea.  If I really want to get laid, all I have to do is open the door and pop my asshole out.  Somebody will show up.  I don't think I can live out here full time, man.  I'm a little depressed.  It's like I kind of like it, but I miss New York. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, man, it's cool to be here.  You're like Woody Allen, man.  You're a New Yorker.  It's hard for a New Yorker to go out there.  Oh, I think it makes me fucking kids.  Very good.  Have you seen any stars out there, Jimmy?  Dude, just Steven Seagal.  I got a picture of him.  Nobody else, though.  No one yet?  Nobody.  I haven't seen one celebrity except for him, and that was like day two.  I went to this thing with Yoshi because the Dalai Lama was supposed to be there,  so I was going to try to get a picture of the Dalai Lama.  That's a good one.  Yeah, but it turned out he didn't show up, but Seagal did, so I got a picture with him. 
[03:06:30]  We were once in an elevator with the Dalai Lama.  What did he say?  Nothing.  Nothing, man.  But we looked him in the eye.  You're not supposed to look him in the eye, and we did.  Why not?  And nothing happened.  Oh, didn't you ever see the movie?  You're not supposed to look the Dalai Lama in the eye.  You're not supposed to be higher than he is.  That's right.  Like, Tali, you got to bow.  He was higher than us.  He had the penthouse suite.  I didn't know that.  At the Ritz-Carlton in Atlanta, yeah.  I think that's when he's a kid.  So wait a minute, so everybody was bowing on the elevator?  No. 
[03:07:00]  Not like he had his security guys with him.  We just kind of hung out.  Didn't we kind of wave and say, hey?  Yeah, we just tried to start some small talk with the Dalai Lama.  Yeah.  As we rode the elevator up to our crappy rooms, and then he went up to the penthouse suite.  You should have handed him a wow sticker.  Yeah.  Take a picture.  There you go.  All right, well, I'm tired, man.  I'm going to go back to bed for an hour.  I just wanted to check in.  I got an hour and a half, actually, before I got to get up.  We're doing these Opie and Anthony movie trailers, and one came in for the movie Steve 
[03:07:30]  from Yellowstone.  It was pretty good.  About what?  Just you playing the part of Steve from Yellowstone.  Romo.  Oh.  That felt kind of...  I couldn't do it that good last time, because I'm in a hotel.  It was a little after 7 in the morning, and I didn't realize how loud Ben from Boston  was.  So I'm standing there, cackling like a fucking idiot.  I'm like, Jesus Christ, man.  This is really loud.  Well, the trailer didn't go anywhere, but the clips he came up with of you doing Steve  from Yellowstone was very funny.  Oh, he dubbed it in clips. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You guys got to come out, man.  Come to a tape.  There's a way to get tickets.  I'm not too sure how to do it yet, but every Thursday or Friday we tape, but I got two  more before I come back, so maybe for the next...  Bill Burr does the show with who?  Yeah, but if we come out, can't we just get tickets from you?  I don't know.  Oh, you're in that position where you can't really give us tickets?  No, I can get them.  I just don't know how to do it.  Oh, okay.  Well, can't we just like, I don't know, hang out with you?  Yeah, of course.  Get strep throat?  Get strep throat and stuff? 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, we all get sick together.  If I'm on the set, you know how it is when you're out in another place and your friends  from New York come and you're on the set.  On the set.  You have time for a quick hello, but you really can't be the same guy you are back in New  York.  Getting treated by the set doctor.  Oh, that's how he would be, too.  I know.  All right, you guys know you can hang out here.  Yeah.  And I got work to do, so you'd be in the holding area.  Yeah, getting treated like shit.  Getting pushed around by everyone.  Yeah.  This is my friends from New York, you know, just trying to push you off on some PA. 
[03:09:00]  Oh.  Watch Jimmy hit the stage.  Well, I'm the neighbor.  Yeah.  Oh, dude.  Fuck, I really, at one point, I'm finished.  There was a couple lines I just couldn't get in rehearsal.  They were killing, and then I had to change something about the way I did them, and they  just fucking bomb, you know how bad it is to bomb, Bill, I'm sure you had to do that  when you've done shoots where, like, something gets a laugh, and then you fucking do it too  many times, and then something stops working, and you're just bombing in front of the camera.  Oh, no.  In front of the network execs.  Oh, dude, it was the HBO run-through.  I bombed so badly when the fucking executives finally came through. 
[03:09:30]  I don't think I got a laugh on one thing I said.  Oh, no.  Yeah, I replaced somebody who got fired, so I was convinced that I was going to get fired.  Like, it took at least, like, seven episodes.  My manager was finally like, dude, they're not getting ready at this point.  Was it County's?  Yeah.  Okay.  That went nowhere.  No, there was a...  County's?  No, there was a show Billy did just a guy.  Yeah. 
[03:10:00]  All right, Jimmy.  Yeah, fuck, we had a show.  All right, Jimmy.  All right, boys.  They're telling us you gotta go.  I know.  Who's that?  Who's telling you besides all four of our subconscious?  Yeah, we're all wondering who's going to say the line today, you know.  Jimmy was going to say it for himself today.  Dude, please.  I want to let me be.  Sick.  I feel like shit, and I got fucking sick breath.  You know that sick breath?  Drink your water bottle, and you smell the lid after you drink it. 
[03:10:30]  Jesus.  All right, good.  All right, I'll talk to you guys.  I might call you Wednesday.  I can't tell you if I'm going to call you Wednesday.  All right, cool, Jimmy.  Bye, Jimmy.  Hang in, Emma.  I'll talk to you guys.  All right, Jim.  Jim Norton, everyone.  Jimmy Norton out there in Hollywood.  Being a star for HBO.  Being a star.  And there are people, like I said last week, people that are brand new to the Opie and  Anthony program, just coming on board, that have no idea who Jimmy is, that he's part  of the show.  They completely are comfortable with Opie, Anthony, and Bill. 
[03:11:00]  That's the show.  That's the only show they've ever known.  How about that, Bill?  There are people that think this is the show, and this is it.  You really think that?  Absolutely.  Well, wait.  You've been doing it for about a week and a half, almost two weeks now.  It's the only show they know.  Wow.  We have new listeners that are only two weeks.  There are going to be listeners that hate Jimmy Norton and want Bill Burr back.  They'll be like, where the fuck did Bill go?  There'll be eight of them.  Your show sucks now, that Bill is gone, and this Jimmy Norton guy is here. 
[03:11:30]  Believe me.  It happens.  We see it.  How do you replace getting shit on by a transvestite?  You really can't.  You can do his work on that.  You hold the fort.  Yeah, you hold down the fort, right.  The funny thing is, Jim Norton doesn't know he's fired yet.  He just keeps calling in.  Oh.  Not on the air.  Start that rumor.  Not on the air, Opie.  Start that rumor.  Well, the message boards will take a hold of that.  Did you hear Opie?  Can we get E-Rock in here?  You can hear it in his tone.  He was serious.  Let's get E-Rock. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, I've got to call him out on something.  We've been doing the Opie and Anthony movie trailers, and for the last week, he's been  handing me a movie trailer I guess he did for our old show or something, and he wants  us to replay it.  I forgot.  Oh, I love when I forget E-Rock with his walk-on music.  Yeah.  What's up, E-Rock?  He's not a muse.  Have you spent that $100,000 yet?  Some of it.  Not a lot.  Ah, what are you buying?  Furniture.  Furniture.  Mm-hmm.  That's pretty exciting.  That's good. 
[03:12:30]  Nice for the apartment.  Mm-hmm.  Why the low energy?  I'm sick.  I've been fighting it since Friday.  Oh, my God.  So why'd you come into work?  What do you got?  You're not doing anyone a favor.  Trust me.  We are so germ-conscious these days.  He actually told me this because we had to ride the elevator up, and I was trying to be  nice, and I'm just thinking to myself, great.  I'll be sick by Wednesday.  Once you feel any heat from the body, from the breath, from anywhere, you feel heat on  you, you're infected.  It's over.  You're in the hot zone. 
[03:13:00]  That's all it takes?  Yeah.  That heat.  It's full of sick.  What do you think you have that we're all going to have by Wednesday?  I don't know.  Yeah.  My throat is just really bad.  Oh, great.  Strep throat.  That's the one I get every year.  Oh, I'm feeling a little...  Good.  Strep furniture?  Yeah.  That's exciting.  What did you pick up?  Furniture-wise?  Yes.  I haven't gotten it yet.  A bed?  A bed.  And a new couch.  Where'd you go?  Ikea. 
[03:13:30]  Thanks to Big Kev.  Look.  You know what?  That's like the prizes at the end of the Wheel of Fortune.  Exactly.  They had the worst...  It's awful.  You win all this money, and you get the selection.  For $700, I'll take the brass bed frame.  Yeah.  Yeah, remember that?  When you used to have to buy the prizes?  You'd spend all that money?  How about the cash?  And it's crap.  Oh, my God.  He went to Ikea.  Why would you go to Ikea?  You won $100,000.  Not only is a garden...  And I'm sure Ikea does a good job, but it's an affordable firm.  You've got to build it yourself, right?  There's a lot of the stuff that Allen wrench... 
[03:14:00]  You bring your couch home in a box, a few different boxes you've got to assemble yourself.  They supply the wrenches in a little plastic bag, staple to the bottom.  There's always a couple of screws missing.  Something's missing.  They sell furniture that you see at beach houses.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're not going to be there all the time.  You just need something to fill a room up.  Pretty much.  I don't need anything fancy.  Oh, is that it?  Fancy.  But when it gets delivered, it's not even going to be set up.  What about the bed?  You got that from Ikea, too?  Just the bed frame, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:14:30]  Not the mattress, though.  No.  I already have that.  It's laying on the floor now, and you're...  On a box spring.  You're even dull when you go to buy furniture.  Money bags.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Nothing.  You want $100,000.  Yeah.  You went to Ikea.  You went to Ikea.  We were smoking a cigar.  Har-ar-ar-ar.  I'd like to see something on a sofa.  Har-ar-ar.  What's this scary...  Money hanging out of his pocket?  What's this movie trailer thing that you keep pushing on me?  It's the movie Scream.  It's a movie trailer of the movie Scream with Andrew Dice Clay mixed into it. 
[03:15:00]  I had sent it to you back at the old show.  Remember him?  Did we play it on the old show?  You sent this in?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  When you were just a fan.  So you put this together.  We make dreams come true here on the Opie and Anthony program.  He went from fan to working for the show.  Yeah.  Did we play?  We did?  I think only once and that was it.  Uh-oh.  Dude, back then...  We used to play shit a million times just to, you know, to eat up time.  If it was even halfway decent. 
[03:15:30]  You're admitting that we only played it once?  That I'm aware of.  You know what that means?  We never listened to this stuff beforehand, so we'll play it on the air and go,  okay, here you go.  Then throw it to the side, never to be heard again.  Well, let's take a listen here.  All right.  Let's listen.  Boundary Music Pictures presents a hairy banana film.  Someone is playing a deadly game.  It all began with a scream over 9-1-1. 
[03:16:00]  Someone who's seen one too many scary movies.  Now he's taking his love of fear.  Hello, Sidney.  Yeah, who the f*** is calling this house 11.30 at night?  One step too far.  Who the f*** is this?  Tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.  The Ragamo.  What's your favorite scary movie?  It's all porno movies.  Rub eggs and tomato sauce all over your big f***, so I shoot one in my pants.  Are you alone in the house? 
[03:16:30]  Oh, I'm gonna...  There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie.  Number one.  You can never have sex.  Who said what to hold?  Number two.  Never, ever, ever under any circumstances say, I'll be right back.  Because you won't be back.  I'm getting another beer.  You want one?  Yeah, sure.  I'll be right back.  Hey, go for you.  He didn't make the rules.  He just kills by them. 
[03:17:00]  Listen, you little bitch.  You hang up on me again, I'll cut you like a fish.  Understand?  Hey, go for you.  Here's your little pen knife.  You can cut people's feet when you get mad.  Go ahead.  Don't answer the phone.  Don't open the door.  Yeah, just shut up before I choke you to death.  Don't try to hide.  Everybody's a suspect.  Got it.  That's scary.  Scary scumbag, too.  I'm over here now, Sidney.  Starts Friday in an O&A market near you. 
[03:17:30]  All right.  That's good production.  Yeah.  Got any Y2K material?  Let's say hi to Jason in Texas.  Jason!  I hope you, man.  I love the show, but I got to call you out.  You give it Eric a hard time about buying that cheap furniture.  You look like me in there with all the money, and what's in your house, fella?  Well, I have a couch. 
[03:18:00]  And?  I have a dresser, finally, but the clothes are on top of the dresser still, by the way.  That's the update on the dresser, because someone was asking about that.  And?  And I have a bed.  And at least, oh, I mean, at least, Eric, he got, you know, 100 grand.  What's 100 grand to you?  That's two more bags of shelves.  All right, I'll try to get a, uh, I don't know, maybe, uh, like, um, what else can I  get?  Maybe, uh, do you own a coffee table?  Yeah, I finally got, oh, I did get a glass coffee table.  Oh! 
[03:18:30]  Wait, what, is a coffee table the one that goes in front of the couch?  Yeah.  I don't have one of those.  What, what did you get?  I guess it would be an end table.  You got an end table before you got a coffee table?  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, guys, love the show, punch it out.  All right.  Jason makes a good point.  All right, Eric, thank you.  That was wonderful.  Good luck with the strep throat.  Yeah.  How's the auction going?  Auction's going good.  Ends this week.  Quiet.  Ends this week?  As far as what?  As far as everything.  We've got about three days left.  Three days left on the last items? 
[03:19:00]  Mm-hmm.  On the last items.  We raised about $50,000 so far, right?  Uh, yeah, about.  Very cool.  How's that Al Pacino poster?  $960 the last time I looked.  That's it?  For the Scarface poster signed by everybody, including Al Pacino.  Mm-hmm.  Go to opianthony.com for the link to the Opie and Anthony auction.  Mm-hmm.  There he goes.  E-Rock.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Look at him.  In time to the music.  Fantastic.  Uh, Nick L.  Says, uh, wow, I remember this.  Good work, E-Rock. 
[03:19:30]  Now go get your fucking shine box.  Oof.  Well, uh.  Nothing?  Crass me saying that.  The National Board of Health and Lucky Fellow brand suppositories bring you your body and  you.  Hosted by famed sexual behavior expert, Professor Jim Norton.  I'm a perv and I'm weird, but I'm straightforward.  Professor Norton outlines his very hands-on approach to sexual education.  Wait till your kids are sleeping.  Just lay over one of them.  They won't help.  Oh, Jesus.  What? 
[03:20:00]  For example, the art of foreplay.  The first thing I do is go to the bathroom and take one of those eight decibel shits.  Oral sex.  Why?  Sexual experimentation.  I was performing tushalinga.  And sexually transmitted diseases.  I wish I had AIDS so I could bite somebody.  And for the grown-ups, there's also a segment on marriage counseling.  Honey, you're 41.  Can I finally have the balloon nut?  He'll also stress the importance of lubrication.  You want it to sound like when your muddy boot gets stuck like a quagmire?  Another word to the wise from Professor Jim Norton.  Remember, I'm the saint. 
[03:20:30]  Hey, all right.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program. 
[03:21:00]  Bill Burr sitting in for Jimmy Norton, doing a great job for us.  BillBurr.com if you want to check out more of Bill Burr.  Or on MySpace.  Or MySpace?  Yeah.  MySpace.com.  There you go.  That thing is blowing up, that old MySpace concept.  A couple things we can do before we get out of here.  We got a latest Taser video that's up on OpieandAnthony.com and FoundryMusic.com.  Oh, we love the Tasers.  We're into the Taser.  We're all about people getting tased these days.  We're all about it.  We're all about it.  What is that shit that shoots out? 
[03:21:30]  What exactly is it?  Yeah, it's like little wires.  And they got little prongs on them.  And it shoots into the guy's clothes.  And then works like a stun gun from a distance.  Sends like 10,000 volts into you.  Fantastic.  Bigger even.  I think like 50,000 volts, the new one.  And then bam, you're out.  Electrocution from a distance.  Yeah.  Well, we find all the Taser videos and we throw it up on our websites.  We got this latest one.  Wife videotapes husband getting tased.  Have you seen this one yet?  I saw it without the sound. 
[03:22:00]  Very funny.  The guy continues to try to get up.  And of course, hilarity ensues.  Get up.  Why?  I understand arguing because you don't agree with being tased.  And then, you know, you finally get blasted.  At that point, game over.  Just stay down.  Once you're tased and you get up, you know you're getting tased again.  The best scenario is that you beat the Taser and all of a sudden it doesn't affect you anymore.  That would never happen.  But if that ever did, what's next? 
[03:22:30]  What do you think?  The cops are going to go, he beat the Taser.  All right.  Unhook him.  He's going home.  He won.  Then the clubs come out and the real guns come out to shoot and kill you, perhaps.  That would be a great reality show, though.  That would be a great reality show.  Beat the Taser?  Beat the Taser.  You could take it the longest.  Yeah, a lot of criminals that might go to jail, but you give them the chance to not go to jail if they can beat the Taser.  Let's see.  Nope.  Didn't beat it.  How about you? 
[03:23:00]  Wait a minute.  That sounded like the last guy.  They all scream the same way.  Very similar.  Is that the last sound effect, the guy hitting the ground?  Yeah, I think so.  It's him falling.  Going down like a tree.  All right.  Let's listen to the audio of the latest video here.  Dog dick. 
[03:23:30]  Dog dick.  I'm not going to fight.  Dog dick.  For all your left of your soupy little fucker.  No, I'm not going to do that.  I'm going to do that.  Don't fuck me around here.  I'll shoot you.  Fuck you.  No.  No.  Go back there.  Don't go back to the house.  Fuck you.  I don't have to. 
[03:24:00]  Don't go back.  Don't get up.  Just stay down.  Fuck you, baby.  Come on now.  I was your friend all up until now.  Sorry, dear.  That's no friend. 
[03:24:30]  Woo.  That hurts.  I'm going to walk your ass when I get the door.  Play that motherfucker's being used.  Kiss your fucking ass.  You got a look, baby.  Yes, ma'am, please go back to the house.  No, I want to record this because...  No, ma'am, please, please don't do it.  Ma'am, please go back to the house.  Hell hath no fury.  Yeah.  Ma'am.  I just want you to know what I've been putting up with. 
[03:25:00]  The attitude I've been putting up with.  Shining pretty, isn't there?  Now, that wasn't a bullet.  Fuck you.  I know.  But you know what, Dave?  You deserved it because you were chasing him around.  Ma'am, don't antagonize him.  Go back in the house.  Yeah, really.  Ma'am, go back in the house.  Tasing and talking to the woman.  I mean, what...  That's the same thing?  Your attitude around the house is terrible. 
[03:25:30]  It's terrible.  That's on the same level as being electrocuted.  Stupid whore.  I want you to know what you're putting me through.  I saw a great one the other night.  Do you guys ever watch that show, Cheaters?  Yeah, we're talking about Cheaters.  Yeah, I haven't watched that.  I saw this guy.  This redneck dude.  Bald head with like a tattoo on the side.  I mean, he just totally gets caught red-handed.  He's got his hands down this girl's pants and everything.  So, you know, they all come running up.  And he's trying to save it between his wife.  He's like, honey, I love you.  Come on.  Don't you know who this is? 
[03:26:00]  Okay, I love you.  And then the other girl, the one he's cheating on, goes, that isn't...  He said...  Oh, that's what he said.  He goes, you know, we're just messing around.  She doesn't mean anything to me.  And she goes, that isn't true.  You said that you love me.  And he looked at her and legitimately laughed.  He goes, I never said that.  I told you from the beginning we were just fucking...  Straight up honesty.  And she just imploded because she knew it was true.  And she just goes, get this canvas away from me.  She walks away.  Then he goes back to his wife. 
[03:26:30]  And he's totally fucked, but this guy pulls it out.  He's like, honey, I love you.  And she's like, I'm going to leave you.  And he's like, you're not going to leave me because you're my wife.  And she's like, well, what am I supposed to do?  You're out having sex with somebody else.  I mean, what's that about?  And he's like, well, maybe I've been fucking you for 12 years.  And I wanted to fuck something else.  Totally straight up.  He was like in this zen-like state of honesty.  And he just completely pulled all this shit off. 
[03:27:00]  Wow, it worked for him.  While the host is trying to antagonize.  Like, sir, sir, this isn't a good time.  And he would just look at him and just continue with his horse shit.  What a strategy.  Complete and utter honesty.  Oh, it was great.  Maybe I've been fucking you for 12 years and I wanted to fuck something else.  With the whole tone of like, did that ever dawn on you?  What did she say after that?  I don't know.  By the end of it, she was crying.  You know, those girls, they always go back to fucking dudes.  He's like completely shit-faced getting in his rig. 
[03:27:30]  And he drives away.  All right.  We're running out of show here.  I don't know what we could end with here.  What is this big A C song from Paul?  I haven't heard it.  I hear Paul, no filter Paul, recorded Big A singing Brother Joe's Cunt Song.  You know that song?  Oh, okay. 
[03:28:00]  Steve, is this good?  We need to end on an up note today, man.  Better than I thought it was going to be, actually.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, it's funny just because Big A is singing it.  He's a tough critic, too.  Steve's a tough critic.  Yes, he is.  The production is obviously not up to broadcast standards.  Oh, well, then we'll broadcast it.  Well, yeah, exactly.  Well, sorry.  You know what I mean.  Isn't this show broadcasting?  I realized as that was coming out, I'm like, don't say it.  Don't say it.  Too late.  Not up to broadcast standards.  I don't know what we're doing here.  Up to snooty production guy standards.  How about that?  Okay, that's better. 
[03:28:30]  But they added a new verse to your brother song as well.  All right.  Why don't we take a listen here?  You know, Percy goes through the Friends stage, and then, you know, if anything's going  to happen, there's little luck shoots from there.  C is for the way you tap on me.  You is cause you're ugly, and so's your peach. 
[03:29:00]  And it's for, you know, I never told you I growled your sister.  T, thanks for the hummers.  They were better than your mother's.  Cunt is all you'll ever be.  It's true.  It's horrible.  Cunt, you must be more than one. 
[03:29:30]  You're too.  Not with the music at all.  You.  He's carrying the tuna.  Your ass is stanky.  Your ass is always cranky.  Cranky.  Cunt.  The word was made for you.  It's still too early.  I gotta get to know you better, you know.  P is for the pussy, no man will see. 
[03:30:00]  A is for the asshole, you should have given up to me.  T is for the tits, not worth the effort to see.  I is for the idiot, you made of me.  Virgin is what you'll always be. 
[03:30:30]  A box of fucking tank one.  Go fuck yourself.  But, oh, that's something I'd rather see.  Cunt, I can't get a better one than you.  Idiot.  C is for castration. 
[03:31:00]  Drop that on me.  U is like urinating.  Half a shot is free.  Why did they decide that it needed more words?  N is for some negro tearing up your leather cheerio.  T, you friggin' twat.  Though we'll never be forgot.  Cunt, you know you've ever been to me. 
[03:31:30]  Cunt, and a really big one.  And all my friends agree.  Your best slang word for vagina can't describe you any finer.  Cunt, the word's just right for you.  Whoa. 
[03:32:00]  The word was made for you.  Do-da-ba-boo-do-ba.  Cunt, the word was made for you.  Fuck you, bitch.  Yeah!  Whoa!  Hey!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Big A, throw him down the carpet!  Sorry.  There you go.  Wow!  You leave with your fucking manhood intact.  Good man.  There you go. 
[03:32:30]  Whoa!  Big A.  Yeah!  Ow!  Big A, you turn to make...  Oh, wow.  All right.  Holy jeez.  Whoa!  Boo-boo-bee-doo-boo-boo-bee-doo.  What a wreck.  Was he in a tux when he did that?  Smoking a cigarette and a martini in the other hand.  He wasn't bad, though, as far as carrying the tune.  It's just the speech impediment.  He could not stay on the mark.  Yeah.  And I keep the tempo of the song. 
[03:33:00]  All right.  Well, stay tuned for Ron and Fezzer coming up in just a few minutes here.  But first, we go to the phones to end the Opie and Anthony program.  Let's say hi to Pat in Boston.  Hey, Pat.  Hey, guys.  Hey, man.  What's up?  I learned that some of the new listeners don't know who our little Jimmy is.  I don't believe that one.  I don't either.  Well, how would you explain that?  If someone's brand new to XM, they just stumble on us, enjoy the show, and know nothing of it prior to when Jimmy went to Hollywood.  All right.  Maybe we'll explore that tomorrow.  Yeah.  See if that's actually true. 
[03:33:30]  Prozac, Wackbag, what's up?  Good morning, guys.  Hey.  I learned Bill Burr is our version of Oliver, and that little Jimmy invoked the John Ritter Clause.  Yes, he did.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Let's say hi to Pinchy.  Pinchy, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, I learned two things today.  I learned that peeps are sugar-covered chicken abortions, and Goldie Hawn looks like an emaciated Angela Lansbury.  Getting education.  Steve, what's up? 
[03:34:00]  Hey, guys.  Hey, Steve.  I've got a problem.  I love your show.  I love Norton.  But y'all going on these damn tangents, what was the number one candy bar?  Oh, we said that.  All right.  We must have.  Yeah, we went through the list.  Hey, you know what sucks is we never got to that Derek Jeter thing, man.  That was something I really wanted to talk about.  That was one thing, and also the Tara Reid.  Yeah, the Tara Reid role, let's say, for tomorrow's show, definitely.  And the Jeter getting threatening letters.  Yeah, that's time.  Let's see if we can save that story for tomorrow as well.  Yeah, I want to talk about that tomorrow, man. 
[03:34:30]  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  Thanks, Steve.  Let's say hi to John on Whack Bag.  John, what's up?  West Islip?  John?  John from West Islip.  Right.  West Islip.  Anthony, I learned that Alvin Joyce has two little peanuts in them.  Yes.  Okay.  Fuck Keith Wicks.  Thank you.  What did he say?  He had nothing.  I don't know.  Rob on Long Island.  What did you learn on the O.P. and Anthony show today?  What's going on, guys?  Happy birthday, Billy.  Yeah, I learned that Anthony is wearing a nameless mannequin T-shirt.  That's right. 
[03:35:00]  We got a lot done today.  Eric, what did you learn on the show today?  Ikea furniture is for fancy people.  It sure is.  Let's go to Doug Out Doug.  Doug Out Doug, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned you guys don't know your infomercial people.  Don LaPree was the tiny classified ad guy on the beach.  Right.  Hey, very good.  Thank you.  All right.  Teaching us a little something.  Rich learned that Steve C. lives with Shelly Long. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah, in the money pit.  Fast Freddy.  Today I learned Jimmy is like Woody Allen in a kid-touching kind of way.  Tim C. from Springfield, Mass.  Today I learned a Bulimic's favorite candy bar is the Three Musketeers.  And Mike from Winter Park, Florida.  Say hi to my sister.  I learned not to eat the hooker ass in California.  Bill Burr, thank you.  BillBurr.com.  This concludes our podcast day.  You'll be at the Anthony Show. </pre>
