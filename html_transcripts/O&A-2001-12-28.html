<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a segment focused on Regis Philbin's pregnant co-host, Kelly Ripa.  The hosts launched into a barrage of crude and offensive jokes about Ripa's pregnancy, including graphic descriptions of violent methods to induce a miscarriage and sexually aggressive comments.  They expressed their disdain for the prospect of Ripa discussing children on the show, contrasting her negatively with Kathy Lee Gifford.  Listener calls amplified the vulgarity and chaotic nature of the discussion, with callers suggesting similarly violent solutions to the pregnancy.  The segment concluded with the hosts' continued outrage and dark humor.

This was followed by a segment dedicated to Anthony's new home gym.  The hosts and callers relentlessly teased Anthony about his physical condition and the likelihood of him using the equipment, predicting it would become a coat rack.  Cowbell Bill and Anthony's brother, Joe, were in the studio during this segment, contributing to the playful ribbing.  Anthony also discussed an upcoming TV appearance.  Later in the show, a discussion about Marilyn Monroe's alleged flatulence devolved into inappropriate jokes, followed by a humorous song by Steven Lynch about necrophilia, and a discussion about Sean Connery's alleged spousal abuse.  Finally, an intern's questionable injury claim was addressed.

The intern, Brian, arrived at work with a large bandage and eye patch, claiming a motorcycle accident where his head supposedly went through his car window.  The hosts and staff immediately expressed skepticism.  A prolonged debate ensued, highlighting inconsistencies in Brian's story—lack of visible injuries despite claims of stitches and glass in his eye, and the implausibility of the accident itself.  Anne-Marie, a coworker, described Brian as accident-prone and prone to exaggeration, while other coworkers shared similar anecdotes.  A police officer, Keith, was called to assess the plausibility of the accident. Brian eventually removed his bandage and eye patch, revealing no injuries, leading to disbelief and frustration. A listener vote on whether to send Brian home resulted in a tie, leading to more calls and discussion.  Ultimately, Brian was allowed to stay, but was strongly admonished.  A caller also attempted a humorous coming-out to his mother on air.

A subsequent segment saw a more intense confrontation with Brian, who was accused of a “breach of faith.”  Accusations, arguing, and interruptions from Stink, Ben, Jess, and Rick followed, with Brian eventually admitting some fault.  He was ultimately placed on a "permanent layoff" and sent home. This was followed by a “peach-eating” contest between listener Wendy and studio guest Marco, during which Marco became visibly distressed and cried, ultimately receiving NSYNC concert tickets as consolation. Wendy won a trip to Cancun. Cassidy, an adult film actress, was present in the studio during this segment.

The show continued with Anthony impersonating Ronald Reagan in a complex ruse involving a fake phone call, faulty connection, and various staff members, including Ken, being dispatched to troubleshoot.  The reveal that it was Anthony caused amusement and frustration.  The upcoming guests, Chris Jericho and Mongoose McQuaid, were mentioned before concluding the impersonation bit. The broadcast also included an interview with Bob May, the actor who played the Robot in *Lost in Space*. The hosts initially mistook him for the voice actor, leading to comedic awkwardness. May discussed the physical challenges of wearing the suit, including incidents of being locked inside, smoking inside it, and on-set mishaps with Jonathan Harris. He also mentioned working on Jerry Lewis films and promoted his convention appearances.  The interview was punctuated by interruptions, other calls, and humorous side conversations about missing money and baseball allegiances. Jeffrey Ross was present in the studio for the latter part of this segment.  The hosts concluded the interview with expressed discomfort and jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Regis. Regis has a new co-host. A new co-host for Live with Regis and who? It's now going to be called Live with Regis and Kelly.  Regis and Kelly. Kelly's from... Well, who's this hot whore? Kelly's from All My Children. I love it!  Some hot number on my show, finally. I dump that Kathy Lee. And now this one. Oh, I want to get my F on with her. Let me tell you. I'll slam that A. A C. Everything. Gelman, get me a rubber. I don't know where she's been. 
[00:00:30]  Regis. Who wants to F Regis? Regis. I'll punch her in the T's. Regis, before you think that, yes, please. She's from All My Children.  All My Children. You know, those soap girls. Very hot. I like that. I'll get my F on. I've cheated on my wife one time, according to the star, allegedly. I gotta say that, you know.  He has sold the wine. All right, Mike Tyson. Regis. Yes. She's four months pregnant. Four months... What? Your new co-host is four months pregnant. It's gonna be Regis and... 
[00:01:00]  Four months... If this bitch calls it Cody or Cassidy, I'm killing her. Killing her! I gotta get Mike Tyson on the phone.  Perhaps he could punch her in the gut a few times. Gelman, come here. Gelman! First show live with Regis and Kelly. It's an abortion show.  Hangar abortion show. Four months? That's not bad. Gelman, get over here. Regis. Help me out with this thing. Get me some gloves and a hanger. 
[00:01:30]  Regis, you're outrageous. I'm gonna pull the fetus out, Gelman. You're outrageous.  Do you honestly believe I want another woman here that's having a baby? I was tired of the stories all day with the Cassidy and the Cody.  Now I'm gonna have a Kelly talking about children? Get the hanger, Gelman. Get me a Flobie. We'll suck it out.  Jesus. I don't care. You know, we sit on those high stools on the set. Perhaps she could just fall and a spontaneous miscarriage. 
[00:02:00]  Help me, Gelman. Grease the stool. Do something. What do you do, Gelman?  It's not that bad. She's young. She could bounce back.  I thought you wanted to do her, though, Regis.  Fine. But she doesn't have to get pregnant. What's the matter? You don't do it in the dumper?  Huh? Do it in the dumper, Kelly. Just suck it, you bitch.  Unbelievable. Now she'll be babbling about children. 
[00:02:30]  I finally got rid of that twat, Kathy Lee.  Now I have to deal with this.  Eatin' ain't cheatin'. That's what Regis and the president say.  Eatin' ain't cheatin'.  Well, congratulations, Regis.  Well, I did know about this pregnancy thing.  It's Regis and Kelly's.  For God's sake.  Starting next Monday.  Regis and Kelly Lee?  No, no, no, no. Kelly Ripper or something like that.  Perhaps I could spike her food with some kind of a spontaneous abortion pill. 
[00:03:00]  Think of the ratings, Gelman.  Think of the ratings.  Where she's propped up in the stirrups.  Me with gloves and a hanger on.  Maybe we could have a guest help me.  We'll have Wayne Newton come on and assist.  He's always good on the show.  And the fetus will look just like GIF.  Dig in here. Let me dig in.  Hold on, Gelman.  Okay, I got an arm. 
[00:03:30]  I'm gonna puke. Cut it out.  Look at the ratings go up.  Cut it out.  This bitch better take her to the dumper.  Let's, uh...  Perhaps if she drives home in the snow, she'll hit an abutment.  No.  Who uses that word?  No, Regis.  You picked her.  You wanted her.  Look, the fetus looks more like Gelman.  You had all those women.  You wanted Kelly.  I didn't know about the pregnancy.  I thought she had a bunt.  I find out it's a baby.  I thought she had a fat upper, you know, Regis. 
[00:04:00]  Not a baby.  I spent years with that Kathy Leapage talking about her children.  What, and now I have to look forward to Kelly doing Christmas albums with another little kid?  Hell no.  Hell no.  Get the phobia.  This isn't right.  For the love of God.  Here it comes.  Give me that baby.  Give me the baby.  Give it to me.  There it goes.  In the toilet. 
[00:04:30]  I swear, Gelman, if she brings that little bastard in, I'm gonna kill myself.  I'll kill myself.  There will be ratings.  Or I'll kill it myself.  Write clearer next time, Rick.  Tommy.  Yes.  Yeah, what's up?  What doesn't matter with you guys?  What?  What's your problem?  What do you mean, what's my problem?  Regis.  Come on, stop talking about ripping the kid's arm off.  What's the matter with you guys?  Okay, I'll try to get it all in one piece. 
[00:05:00]  Seems to be the problem.  I can understand his outrage.  I'll go in and get the whole thing.  Sam, what's up?  Regis, why are you hitting on Kelly so bad?  Girls are hot.  I don't like the idea of a child, but I'll tell you one thing I'm gonna do, Gelman.  I'll leave some prints in that kid's soft head.  Oh my God.  I'll do it.  You know about doing pregnant women, right?  Of course, Gelman.  Check, please.  I'm a madman now.  Madman.  Check, please.  I had it going. 
[00:05:30]  I was having fun with Kelly, and something bit my junk.  Didn't even think they had teeth.  I'll bend her over that tall stool, Gelman.  I'll bend her right over the tall stool.  And speaking of stools.  What?  God damn it, I thought we were all having fun.  Why is everyone so upset on the phone?  I won't have a bringing children in. 
[00:06:00]  Doug, what's going on?  Enough, guys.  Come on.  What's the problem, Doug?  Be, be, be, stop.  Doug, talk to me.  What's the problem?  Use your brains.  Use your brains.  Come on.  I'm turning you guys off, but I'll listen to you guys tomorrow.  Doug, what's the problem?  Enough.  Enough with what?  Think about what you're doing.  I'm talking about Kelly, my new co-host.  She's pregnant, Doug.  What am I supposed to do?  It's pretty hot, though.  What am I supposed to do?  Now she's going to bring children on like that Kathy Lee whore.  Enough. 
[00:06:30]  Pull the plug.  Punch out, man.  Pull the plug on the baby.  Oh, Jesus.  Gelman, you bite this milk accord.  You bite it.  What's your problem with kids?  Rick, you fuck.  It's always time to stop when Rick writes that one.  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  Why doesn't O.J. just take care of the whole thing?  That's what I'm worried about here.  I mean, the whole reason.  O.J., O.J., hello?  Regis Philbin, O.J. from Live with Regis and some other whore.  Kelly.  Regis and Kelly.  Kelly, whatever.  Big day for you, Regis. 
[00:07:00]  O.J., I need your help.  Come on the show.  And I swear to God, could you just slit someone's throat again?  You've done it once before.  What's the problem?  She's blonde and white.  She's blonde and white.  Kill her.  Kill the bitch.  If she only liked it up the old dirt road, she wouldn't be pregnant.  I wouldn't have to worry about these things.  I love it.  You know something?  If only she was a crumpet muncher.  If she was a crumpet muncher, there wouldn't be this problem. 
[00:07:30]  Well, doggie.  The baby from her stomach is checking in.  Uh, yes, little one.  Yeah, why don't you come try it, you little bitch?  Come on, I swear to God, I'm going to stick my hand in the elbow deep and pull you out.  Yeah, really?  I can't take these kids anymore.  You already tried it with a wire, you son of a bitch.  I'll get you next time.  You're bobbing and weaving, but I'll get you.  I'll hook you like a trout.  Smart-ass fetuses, I get.  I'm trying to do a program. 
[00:08:00]  I'm trying.  Again, Regis, it's your problem, though.  You picked her.  I didn't know.  I swear to God.  You had a lot of other pieces of asses.  I thought she was hitting the Danish a little too hard and had the fat upper P region.  I've seen it before.  And then before you know it, they're parading them on the show singing Christmas songs.  Jay, what's up?  Ed, you are a sick ass.  This brings you to a new low, man.  Why don't you have Mike Tyson come in there and take care of us?  Perhaps I should call Mike Tyson. 
[00:08:30]  A couple of body blows the baby's got.  Maybe we could get her familiar with the surroundings of the set.  Bring her up on the catwalk for the lighting and push her off.  Gentlemen, book it.  Ron, what's up?  Babe, Reg, can we poll the audience and see if we can ask them if we can pickle a placenta?  Maybe put it in a jar?  Now, you're that confident that the audience can help you?  Look how cocky he gets.  You're that confident?  You're going to phone a friend?  How about you phone the fetus and tell him get the hell out of it? 
[00:09:00]  Let's go to Carol.  Carol, what's up?  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Hello.  Hey.  Regis, I have bad news for you.  What now?  Miss Ripa already has a child.  You're kidding.  No, I watch all my children, and this is her second child, yeah.  It doesn't sing, does it?  I don't believe so.  Perhaps I could beat the child with the fetus.  Take two birds with one stone, Gelman.  What a c**t.  Oh, whoa, Regis.  What's the problem? 
[00:09:30]  Hello?  You can't say that.  I say it on my show all the time, the C-word.  You can't say that.  See you next Tuesday.  You can't say that, John.  But what if she is, John?  Yeah.  What's up?  I want to know if Regis can bang Kelly so hard that he gets a hummer from the fetus.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Look at the time.  Oh, God, no.  Oh, and I'm sick.  All right.  Let's change the subject.  Thank you, Regis.  Good luck with the new show, Regis and Kelly.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:10:00]  A week from Monday.  It's going to be Regis and a pile of placenta.  Live with Regis and a pile of placenta.  I love it.  All right.  212-757-1027.  Right, Matt Dumpa.  We'll take a break, and hopefully we'll be back.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  I don't think you trust me in my self-righteous suicide. 
[00:10:30]  I cry when angels deserve to die in my self-righteous suicide.  I cry when angels deserve to die. 
[00:11:00]  Back with the old good Anthony show.  Yes.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, are you two fools going to talk about anything he's late?  Oh, it's not even a good story.  I forgot we kept teasing that.  You're a bigger tease than the Fox show about Temptation Island.  Well, I don't know.  Ant's trying to get in shape.  Well, don't make it sound like that.  So we can look extra good for the TV show.  I'm not trying to get in shape or anything.  Thank you, Brian.  I'm not serious, and I'm like, yeah, I'm going to get all buff and everything.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, I just think I could do with a little toning, Opie. 
[00:11:30]  So instead of getting one of those workout things like Cowbell Bill got, the workout, the body blade.  The body blade that hit him in the nuts and the forehead at the same time.  The body blade, which amounts to a strip of steel with a couple of, like, weights on either side of it.  And you go, yai, yai, yai, with the thing.  You shake it back and forth.  He did it in front of his face, hit himself in the head and in the nuts.  And then there's been, like, these workout machines that are supposed to slide under the bed, and then they stay there because they're too much of a pain in the ass.  It pulls out easily and sets up in seconds, and they never do. 
[00:12:00]  Why not join a gym?  Because my hours are very wacky, and it's very hard for me to go to a gym after the show.  You know, I don't get home until 9 o'clock as it is a lot of nights.  What am I going to do?  Go to a gym, and then come home, I'll be beat.  And don't ask me to get up early or anything like that.  I don't want to go before the show because I'm being tired.  You've got a home gym.  I have a home gym. 
[00:12:30]  Like one of those big universals.  I mean, I'm hearing it's, like, full size, like something you would see in a gym.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's got all the things, all the features open for every part of your body.  And that's right.  You've got enough places to hang everyone's coat when you have coats when you have that next party.  No, and that's the thing.  Every workout machine, all these fads and trendy workout machines become coat racks.  This thing is like a full set of goddamn monkey bars in my bedroom.  Anthony, I'm going to tell you what's going to happen. 
[00:13:00]  All right.  Go ahead, Opie.  First of all, you set it up last night.  Yeah, I was exhausted after even setting the goddamn thing up.  So, officially, you've had your first workout?  My first workout was actually lifting the plates up onto the rails that they ride on and lowering them down.  It's like, oh, God, my arm's killing me.  That's funny.  He said plates.  All right.  Boy, you think I should have just put one there and put the rest in the closet?  Like Brian Regan would say, you're the one plate guy.  Clang.  Clang, clang, clang. 
[00:13:30]  Clang.  Okay, Thunder.  It's just something.  First of all, it's always there.  Every time I get up in the morning or I'm going to bed at night, it's right there.  Doesn't conveniently store anywhere.  You do a few quick sets.  As soon as you get up, there you go.  I'll pump up for the show, Opie.  And then it can't be covered up with coats.  The thing's gigantic.  Yeah, this is the music I play. 
[00:14:00]  I want to be a woman, I want to be a woman, I want to be a woman, I want to be a woman, I want to be a woman, I want to be a woman, I want to be a woman, I want to be a woman, I want to be a woman, I want to be a woman, I want to be a woman, I want to be a woman, I want to be a woman, I want to be a woman, I want to be a woman, I want to be a woman, I want to be a woman, I want to be a woman, I want to be a woman, I want to be a woman, I want to be a woman.  If you want to be a whole maniac, I can sure tell you how to speak.  Oh, wow, that hurts.  This is my credo. 
[00:14:30]  Listen to them.  Be quiet, huh?  And, Anthony, knowing our listeners.  I'm going to be alchemy.  Anthony, knowing our listeners.  Yeah.  I'm sure no one is going to take your face and put them on, like, you know, muscle bodies on opianthony.com.  Making sick pics or anything.  I don't think you'll see any of those.  You don't think so?  No, no.  Your head on a ripped body or anything.  No.  You better watch out where you are.  Quiet.  You may be just where you hang your hat. 
[00:15:00]  Can you feel the music?  Can you feel the beat?  You don't need your guys.  Doug, what's going on?  What's up?  Trade, say your prayers, eat your vitamins.  Anthony, did you set up arms coming at Box 2?  Shut up, you jackass.  Well, Anthony, we've shared a lot on this show.  You're just not the workout type.  Well, here's words from my personal trainer.  Now we're having fun.  Now we're having fun.  Mike, what's up?  You're close.  Give them to me. 
[00:15:30]  Now.  You should hire him to lift the weights for you.  Hello, cutie pie.  Hey, Mike, what do you have?  Oh, hey.  Listen, Anthony, who are you kidding?  You're a kid, man.  It's going to be a giant coat rack.  A what?  A giant coat rack.  Oh, a giant coat rack.  It's going to be a giant coat rack, bro.  Yeah, I'll tell you, it would be a giant one.  It's huge.  So what's going to happen, you'll be motivated for two weeks.  Yeah.  Then you'll be a little sore, so you'll take a little time off.  Next thing you know, you're going to just be staring at this thing when you wake up in the morning. 
[00:16:00]  No, no, no.  I'm starting on the steroids.  How are you going to keep motivated?  I'm going to keep motivated.  My motivation is going to be keeping in shape in this music.  That's it.  And it's right there.  Stares me in the face.  What the hell?  It's not something that can be pulled into a closet somewhere.  What the hell happened to you, man?  What?  You're not the same guy.  You're changing.  I am not.  I'm the same ass wife I've always been. 
[00:16:30]  I'm going to get all your friends together.  Oh, and have an intervention?  And we're going to have an intervention.  You son of a bitch.  What happened to your big 70s afro?  What happened to the guy that would just drink until showtime?  Well, something's never changed.  And then continue drinking after the show.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, Opie, I have certain responsibilities now to the program.  I'm an employee of two networks.  And I think I have a responsibility to people, to our fans and whatnot. 
[00:17:00]  You guys got to see how smooth Anthony looks on that stage for XFL game day.  And I'm looking at Anthony in the back office going, I do not know that guy.  I'm like, what the hell happened to you?  Let me tell you something.  I was crapping my pants.  You have changed so much.  When we first met and we had to go do stuff?  Yeah.  And I'm like, Ed, you know, this is a big meeting. 
[00:17:30]  You know, they're looking to hire us in Boston and they're going to fly us to L.A. and stuff.  So, do you have anything that looks presentable?  I'll wear my unstained T-shirt today.  No.  I could find one.  No joke.  His wardrobe consisted of concert shirts.  Right.  And T-shirts with, like, alcohol products on them.  Yeah.  Yes.  And when we had a really important meeting, he would just make sure these shirts were ironed.  Ironed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, they wouldn't be...  Am I lying? 
[00:18:00]  No, I'll be here.  Probably right here.  We are going back a few years.  Oh, yeah.  I don't want people to think this happened yesterday.  No.  But that's the Anthony I remember from the beginning.  Yeah.  Now I'm looking at you.  We saw, you know, the show that's going to air Saturday at 730 on NBC.  I'm like, I just...  I don't recognize you.  Come on.  You've got, like, a personal fashion designer, I think.  Stylish.  You ever...  It's called a girlfriend. 
[00:18:30]  It's like a collared shirt on Anthony.  I know.  And now you're...  Nice.  She hooks me up.  And now you're working out?  Yeah.  You know, I've got to try to get into a little bit of a better shape.  I'm not...  Look, I'm not unhappy with my body or anything.  I'm not fat.  I don't know, but I could...  I would like to get a little more toned.  Already?  Got to be the gooch, right?  Dry blood.  Dry blood.  Dry blood on opianthony.com.  Holy smoke.  I was taking Anthony's head and putting it on one of these ripped bodies. 
[00:19:00]  Look at your six-pack.  Yeah.  You're sporting a six-pack there.  That's my goal, Opie.  In the old days, you would be carrying the six-pack, but now you're...  Yes.  You're sporting one.  Well, you know, as far as the TV show goes...  Someone's got to make a before and after show.  That would be the best.  Yeah, thank you.  With a little beanpole or something.  You know, I got to tell you, as far as the TV show goes...  Yeah.  It came from years...  See, what I was doing on the show was everything I had watched on television. 
[00:19:30]  That's the only reference point I had.  So I was using everything from what I saw on Ronan Martin's Laugh-In and any live variety  show I had seen in my life.  And that's who you saw.  Yeah.  Not me.  Very good.  A collared shirt on Anthony is like an open wallet in Opie's hand.  That's from Dan from Oboe.  Ouch.  So keep us informed with your workout program.  I will let you know how it goes. 
[00:20:00]  Mm-hmm.  I'll let you know.  If you have...  I'll keep you updated.  If you have this dedication toward the weights like you have toward your computer games...  Yes.  Arnold Schwarzenegger, look out.  You know, if I could just figure out a way to work out and play computer games at the  same time...  If I could figure out how to put the game on pause so I could go and work out for a while...  True, yeah.  That's going to be your biggest challenge right there.  Hey, I'll do it tomorrow.  Right.  I'll start it tomorrow. 
[00:20:30]  I'm so exhausted from Half-Life.  Unreal is killing me.  Pete, what's up?  Oh, is the editor there?  Huh?  Yes, Pete.  Anthony?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm calling your reference to the universe on the paper.  Are you interested in buying it?  Yes, I saw it for sale.  I got into Penny Pitcher.  Hey, Pete, that's funny.  Hey, you're very funny, you bastard.  All right, faggot.  And Berger from New Rochelle. 
[00:21:00]  Anthony, the Joe Piscopo of radio.  Al, what's up?  Yeah, what's going on, bro?  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on, hold on.  Do we have that, though?  You guys love...  You love this.  Because it doesn't happen to you often.  But we all take our turn in the barrel, but you're rarely there.  Hold on.  I don't understand because I am trying to better myself, Opie.  Yep.  That I have to be subject to this type of abuse.  Al?  Yeah. 
[00:21:30]  What's up?  Yo, what's going on?  Hey.  Ant, I got a song for you to work out to, bro.  Yeah.  I ate a tiger, my friend.  Very funny.  Instant, instant, instant request.  Come on.  Eye of the Tiger.  Hey, how did we know that he was requesting that song?  Eye of the Tiger, Anthony.  Eye of the Tiger.  What's the matter with you?  What's the matter with you?  Hey, you know what?  I got to work out of here. 
[00:22:00]  Anthony, I'm going to have your crap thunder.  And teliteness.  Can we count on you running to work, Anthony?  Yeah, I'm going to run from Brooklyn.  Over the Brooklyn Bridge?  There it is.  I'll run over the Brooklyn Bridge.  Every day will be a friggin' marathon for me.  I need stairs.  I can run up and put my fists in the air and spin around.  In your sweatsuit?  Yeah.  High-fiving people on your way into work?  Exactly. 
[00:22:30]  That would be a funny video.  Me, like, running to work in my sweats.  Listeners.  Will kids be following you as you run down the street?  Yes, a whole gaggle of children.  Right.  That I'll try to get dates from.  Yes, it is the Eye of the Tiger.  Will you be going to Russia, Anthony?  Yeah, I'm going to take on the champ.  I'm the party pooper.  How are you? 
[00:23:00]  How are you?  No problemo.  Now we're having fun.  You son of a bitch.  Good morning.  I knew it.  All I had to do was bring it up.  Can't get a break from you guys.  My turn in the barrel.  You'll learn.  You'll see.  I start kicking some ass around here.  Uncle John.  Good afternoon.  I'm calling from Mr. Schwarzenegger's office.  I need to change our workout appointment from 7.30 to 8 o'clock. 
[00:23:30]  No problemo.  Thank you.  Very good.  I have some questions I want to ask you.  I want to answer immediately.  Hey, Lisa.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What up?  Oh, man.  Anthony's going to look at that machine.  He's just going to go, one day, I must break you.  And then that's going to be it.  You should go right over the top.  Why doesn't anyone think I can be motivated to do this?  I'm not doing this. 
[00:24:00]  You've got to understand, I'm not doing this to get, like, Arnold.  You don't think I could...  Shut up and quit your laughing, you bitch.  Listen to this bitch.  Bye.  You're already showing roid rage.  I got roid rage.  You got roid rage.  Why can't anyone think that I could use this in a way to stay toned and in shape without thinking I'm going to try to...  Is that on Hulk's body?  Someone just put my head on Hulk's greased-up body. 
[00:24:30]  And you got his bandana around your head.  Well, I'm Hulkamania.  Yes, I see that.  Billy.  Yo.  What's up, Billy?  Hey, Ann, I got a couple chickens.  You want to chase them around?  Great.  I prefer choking them.  Thank you.  Bunch of jackass.  You faggot.  Dave checking in.  Of course, no kids chasing him.  Just Anthony running from the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Now, that would keep me motivated.  That's all you need to get in shape.  Have her chase you every day.  Oh, man. 
[00:25:00]  Come on.  I don't know what the problem is, though.  You can't accept the fact that I will be able to do this and keep on it?  Joe.  What?  Yeah, why don't you...  Anthony, why don't you try a push-up before you end up spending all your money?  You know, why don't you lift a chair in your kitchen apartment or something?  Try a push-up.  Very funny.  I mean, it's your hand, man.  Just try your own isometrics.  Why don't you push both hands together?  Do something.  Isometrics.  What does math have to do with it, jerk? 
[00:25:30]  What a tool.  Try a push-up.  You know something.  It's a little easier, first of all, ass monkey, to get into a regimen when the motivation and the equipment are right there, available.  It's easier to do certain routines on this machine than it would be for me to remember to get down and do push-ups.  John, what's up?  Hey, Anthony.  Yes. 
[00:26:00]  The only explanation I can possibly think of is that you saw Don West hocking this on the Home Shopping Network last night.  You've got to get this workout machine.  It's the best one ever.  You're not going to believe this.  I use it myself and look at the shape I'm in.  And we're going to give you...  You can open your own gym with this.  Start your own gym.  And we're giving away Tiger Woods Rookie Card.  Unbelievable.  Look at the way this thing works.  Look.  Look at the pulleys moving. 
[00:26:30]  The weights are moving.  God damn it, I can't believe it.  Why try push-ups when you can buy this?  Why lift a chair in your house when you can do this?  This is the best gym ever, period, end of story.  The best one ever till the next one I sell.  Period and done.  No more better ever, ever, ever.  And you can send it back for a full refund as long as you haven't moved it once in any way, shape, or form.  And did you buy workout gloves?  No, I didn't buy workout gloves. 
[00:27:00]  This is the most funnest workout you're ever going to have.  None more more funner.  All right.  Very funny.  Scooter from Westchester.  Bud Light is not a protein drink.  Very funny.  Everyone's a comic.  Uh-huh.  Opie, uh, Ant, don't sweat it.  Opie's just jealous because he can't fit a universal through the door and up the stairs of his treehouse he lives in. 
[00:27:30]  Dan from Ovo.  Very good, Dan.  All right, yeah, we got to go to spots.  Okay.  All right.  Whatever.  Good.  Am I done in the barrel?  Can I come out?  You did a great job.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'll keep you updated on my progress.  All right.  212-757-1027.  As we go to spots.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  You're jackass.  And one.  And two.  And three.  And one.  I want to be a Hulkamaniac, Opie. 
[00:28:00]  Have fun with my family and friends.  I want to be a Hulkamaniac.  I'm Big Dick Black.  I'm Big Dick Black.  If you want to be a Hulkamaniac, I can sure tell you how to stay on track.  You've got to train things.  No!  People are Hulkamaniacs too.  Pasta hearts and pasta beads.  Oh, great. 
[00:28:30]  Good, baby.  Very good.  Very good.  And you see every painful detail of my muscular physique.  So what do you think of my tight pants?  You ever seen a grown man naked?  All right.  Those men wanted to have sex with me. 
[00:29:00]  You people are tools, man.  Can I come out of the barrel?  Yeah.  Yeah, you can, Anthony.  Thank you.  Right after this call.  Craig.  Yes, Craig.  Hey, as soon as you're going to be in front of a mirror going, there is no tomorrow.  There is no tomorrow.  All right, Apollo Creed.  You suck.  Take it easy.  All right.  Chris from Jersey, you'll have better luck sleeping on it and getting muscles by osmosis. 
[00:29:30]  Hey, Steve.  What's up?  Hey.  What's going on, man?  You going to start wearing a guinea cheese every day now to work to show off the new muscles?  Very good.  Very good.  If you come in with one of those shirts, I think I'll...  What do you think I am?  Vinnie the racist?  I know what I'm talking about, Anthony.  Wow.  Jason from Staten Island.  Anthony's starring in the sequel to Pumping Iron called Pumping Aluminum. 
[00:30:00]  Very good.  Funny, funny people.  All right.  I guess that was pretty good that we teased your little workout, Jim.  Thank you so much.  Okay.  Stay there.  From the heart of Tom Square in New York, New York, it's XFL Game Day.  And here's your host, Obi and Anthony.  I will remember you.  I didn't know XFL Game Day was hosted by Crockett and Tubbs.  I will remember me. 
[00:30:30]  This is going to take football where it's supposed to be.  Don't let your life pass you by.  Let's check in with Rusty Tillman and Bruce Beck.  Keep my home, my man.  The Mad Dog, I just want to talk a little bit about this bomb called the XFL.  I'm so tired.  I can't sleep.  Well, first of all, I don't even can look at a football in front of me.  You see that thing? 
[00:31:00]  What's the red and the black?  That much do you mean?  Football's a brown.  Funny how it feels.  Hey, you talk about the pigskin.  You're ruining the classic elements of the game.  You're screaming inside.  It can't be hard.  I will remember you.  Bruce, did you realize that one of the L.A. cheerleaders is a massage therapist?  Will you remember me?  Can they cook? 
[00:31:30]  Don't let your life pass you by.  Will you not go?  Welcome back to the XFL game day.  You suck.  Let's check in with Rusty Tillman and Bruce Beck.  Let me help you with those melons.  A lot of people think that it's easy to be a cheerleader in the XFL.  It's brutal.  You will see for yourself that Anthony cheated and he pushed me. 
[00:32:00]  So afraid to love you.  Obie is going to retrieve the tea after the kickoff.  Cling to a past that doesn't let me in tune.  You look like an ass.  Once there was a darkness keeping in the sky.  Obviously, you haven't seen the show.  That man.  You haven't seen anything at all.  It's so good that I think it might even go over your head. 
[00:32:30]  Remember you.  You know what?  It's so good, I don't even think you need to watch it.  Remember you.  Remember you.  Remember you.  Yeah.  It's that good.  It runs itself.  It runs itself.  Just like the XFL.  Great athleticism, guys.  Does the green bring out my eyes? 
[00:33:00]  And they're covering up the flaws.  Oh, it's pretty.  Oh, come on in.  Come on, make them look pretty.  Can we go to Rusty and Bruce, please?  Anthony, the build-up is finally over. 
[00:33:30]  Bruce, what are you talking about?  Back to you.  Bruce and Opie.  Weep not follow the memory.  And we'll see you next week on XFL Game Day.  Thanks for joining us.  Bruce, that was awesome.  You've got to be kidding me.  There's absolutely no point in XFL.  Opie.  Anthony.  1027.  WNEW. 
[00:34:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Cowbell Bill in the studio.  And Anthony's brother, Joe, hanging out for a bit here.  Sure.  While we were in commercials, you were trying to say something about Marilyn Monroe.  Yes.  They just did a huge auction.  Made an S-load of money off her stuff.  Got like $8 million auctioning off her goods.  And $42,000 paid for a few bikinis.  They were selling her bikinis?  I didn't know that.  A set of bikinis, including a leopard skin print, bikini bottom, estimated at $2,000 to $2,500.  But the whole set sold for $42,000. 
[00:34:30]  I don't know who bought it, but you've got to know, right?  You're buying Marilyn's bikinis.  You've got to take the sniff.  Oh, come on.  You've got to take the sniff.  Come on, Ed.  You're home, alone, finally out of the limelight for buying these things.  You lay them out.  Get under your cupboards.  Yeah.  You know, live with them a little.  And then you just bring one up and it's got to smell like mothballs at this point. 
[00:35:00]  Why, she's screwing moths?  Smells like Joe D.  You know, the guy from the Home Shopping Network should have did that auction.  It would have been much more interesting.  Limited edition people.  Look at this bikini bottom.  Smells like Joe D.'s finger.  Me dialing.  Look at this one.  It's stained people.  Obviously, this was before she could fly on the wings of a maxi. 
[00:35:30]  Little bit of leakage.  What about the birthday dress, Home Shopping?  Happy birthday, Mr. President.  Yeah, that dress.  When she sang that and allegedly had sex with him right afterwards.  Right.  Actual President's blues.  DNA people, clone your own Kennedy with a head.  Oh, man.  Why?  We thought we were all having fun. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, we're having fun, all right.  Isn't it common knowledge that Marilyn Monroe had a flatulence problem?  Yeah.  Oh, that's true.  That bikini could tell.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Time out.  I never heard that before.  Yeah.  It is.  It's common knowledge.  Plenty of people said that she would, like, all the time.  Be farting.  Ooh, Marilyn.  All the time.  Imagine that.  Happy birthday, Mr. President.  Hey, Rob.  Whoa, that stinks, Marilyn. 
[00:36:30]  I'm going to ditch you, but Bobby will take you.  Bobby.  Well, I guess some of those bikinis might show some telltale.  I'm so sorry.  You know, I think there's proof of that, too.  There's a picture.  She wasn't standing over any air grate when her dress blew up.  That was all her, baby.  That was after White Castle, is what you're saying, Anthony? 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Yeah, man, she blew out the candles on the President's birthday cake.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my goodness, Marilyn.  Oh, look at my head went back and to the left.  Back and to the left.  That's the first shot I took to the head.  My God. 
[00:37:30]  Were the candles still lit?  Yeah, it blew the cake up.  Funny, I don't remember this being chocolate frosting.  Didn't Nelton John write a song about her problem?  Yeah, passing the wind, right?  Oh, my God.  I'm more frightened that you just found out you can do Marilyn Monroe's voice, Anthony. 
[00:38:00]  I knew I could do that.  Do that again.  Come on.  Let's put on the hose bag there.  Happy birthday, Mr. President.  Spooky, spooky, spooky.  Happy birthday.  To you.  Oh, sorry.  Ah, Marilyn, soon we'll be calling this the Brown House. 
[00:38:30]  It looked like I rode my 10-speed bike through my mud puddle.  Clear up to my head.  Oh, man.  Oh, that's so wrong.  Gosh.  I'm sure the guy that got those bikinis knows, and we can only speculate.  But... 
[00:39:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  What do you think this show is?  It's a mix between curious bemusement and outright horror.  It's absolutely disgusting.  It's awful.  No.  And trick.  It's really bad, but it's really good.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Truly tasteless and not funny.  Oh, dear.  Smack my bitch up.  Send this out to Sean Connery. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, they want to smack my bitch up.  I guess they don't want him knighted.  They want to strip him of his knighthood.  Yeah, I guess it's a big story in, what, the post today?  Yeah, even after he's, uh, let's see, yeah, he's supposed to be knighted by the queen.  But they want to strip him of it because, uh, well, for years it seems he's just been smacking his bitches up. 
[00:40:00]  Oh.  Come on! What's wrong with that?  Come here. Come here, you lovely little thing.  Come here, come here, give us a kiss.  Little stupid bitch.  God, Sean Connery is, uh, well, it's quite an honor to be knighted and they feel like they shouldn't, uh, give it to someone that beats his women. 
[00:40:30]  And, uh, yeah.  Yeah.  You know?  Well, there was controversy with him, uh, back in, I guess, the early 90s.  He was, uh, on an interview with Barbara Walters and said, uh, he could imagine hitting his wife.  Two years after he said that he tried to justify the statement in Vanity Fair.  Well, let's be honest.  I think we could all imagine hitting our woman.  Oh, my God!  There are times you really do want to do it, but there's something that tells you in the back of your head that it's not a good thing to do.  Well, he tried to explain it by saying, uh... 
[00:41:00]  Sometimes you do get pissed and you imagine a lot of, uh, a lot of things, Anthony.  He says to Barbara Walters, uh, about the Barbara Walters interview in Vanity Fair,  I was really saying that to slap a woman is not the cruelest thing you can do to her.  It's much more cruel to psychologically damage someone.  Isn't that right, you slut?  I'm gonna take a crowbar and smash you in the face with it. 
[00:41:30]  I told her to shit.  What, what?  In the chair.  Oh, oh, oh, sit.  Sit down.  You say sit, very, uh, unusual.  I am the speech impediment of my S's.  I see.  Come here, you're lovely.  Now sit, sit down.  Before I smack you.  Bloody bitch.  Yeah, yeah, uh, this is a great little, little, uh, I guess, story on what happened years ago. 
[00:42:00]  Uh, his wife at the time, the sultry Diana Salento, uh, became friendly with a hotel waiter.  The actor ordered her to go to the hotel suite.  Go back to the suite and shit there and wait for me.  You're saying sit, right?  Shit, that's what I said.  Sit.  Sit in the chair.  Yeah.  Diana Salento, she became friendly with a hotel waiter. 
[00:42:30]  So I said, go back to the hotel and shit and wait for me.  Uh, she went there.  Uh, the actor returned to the suite and allegedly, uh, allegedly, allegedly delivered a brutal beating.  Connery hit her, not with the flat of his hands, but with fists full between the eyes.  Jesus.  Another blow follows the first, and then another and another, until Salento falls back onto the bed, her face a bloody mess. 
[00:43:00]  The next morning, the face of one of the most beautiful actresses of her generation was ballooned up like a puffer fish.  He beat the crap out of her.  What a douche.  Take that.  Talk to a waiter.  Now get back to the suite and shit there and wait for me.  You just don't know.  I'm losing my hair and it pisses me off. 
[00:43:30]  That's what it is.  Going bald.  Hair's falling in my face, you bitch.  Your fault.  Goddamn.  Boy, that sounds pretty brutal.  You know, in the face like that.  My women, I like to actually hit them with, uh, phone books about the body so they can't tell. 
[00:44:00]  Uh, Ike had a good idea.  Remember Ike Turner?  Uh, yeah.  From Ike and Tina Turner?  Yeah.  He would beat her with a car antenna on her body so she could perform later that night and not be all boozed up.  See, Sean Connery doesn't know the, the final odds of beating your woman.  You gotta punch her internal organs.  Like the universe.  Allegedly.  But I like the hotel room thing.  That's good.  Iron Mike likes the hotels. 
[00:44:30]  Because then he don't have to clean the blood up off his own floor of his own house.  Well, what does Sean Connery think of, uh, Mike Tyson's advice there?  Uh, Mike, just go shit in a corner.  Sit, right?  That's what I say.  Why do you keep questioning me?  I just want to make sure.  Of course, I'm saying shit.  Sit down.  I don't want them dumping out of the show if you're, if you're really saying sit.  Sit down.  Yeah.  Shit.  That's what I'm saying.  Right.  Like in a chair.  It's that speech impediment, right?  That's what it is.  Something with my, uh, S's. 
[00:45:00]  I have a hard time saying shit.  I like that O.J. Simpson.  A good man.  What's wrong with that?  Sometimes you, you just imagine that.  You have to shit and concentrate.  Sit down in a chair and concentrate.  Sometimes I just like to sit down on the toilet.  Yeah, so I guess they're going to try to take his knighthood away. 
[00:45:30]  I don't think it means the same thing these days, people.  What's the big deal?  Didn't Paul McCartney get knighted?  I don't see him on armor on top of a horse jousting or anything.  Maybe it meant something in the old days.  Anthony Hopkins, right?  Yeah.  He's a knight now.  Sir Anthony Hopkins knighted.  Yeah, now could you send them all into battle?  Like the old days with big maces and swords.  Could you see that?  Get over here.  Ow.  You chopped my hair off. 
[00:46:00]  It's only a flesh wound.  That's great.  The queen will give me a sword and I'll beat my wife over the head with it.  Bitch.  Sit here.  Sit.  Paul McCartney going into battle.  Swinging a big battle axe.  Please.  What does the knighthood mean anymore?  Swinging the spike ball.  You know what the old knights used to do?  Lock up that snatch. 
[00:46:30]  Remember that?  That's not abusive.  They used to put those chastity belts on them when they went into battle.  Also, the farm workers and stuff couldn't come by and bang them.  Well, then maybe Sean Connery should be knighted.  It's chivalry.  Shut up.  Get back to the suite.  Get back to the suite, you bitch.  And sit there and wait for me.  I hit you with my knight sword and a big mace and that big hammer from Braveheart. 
[00:47:00]  Remember that big hammer they came to the guy's head in?  I can smack my bitch up with that one.  Shut up.  Go with your waiter, friend, you whore.  Wait for me there all bloodied and then I'll slam my yam bag against your ass.  Albeit laugh your balls off.  Sitting on stage.  In a stool.  Sitting.  That's what I said.  Why do you keep correcting me?  I just want to make sure. 
[00:47:30]  Well, thank you, Sean Connery, for stopping by today.  Elton John's a knight.  Jesus Christ.  He's going to go into battle with a dildo.  A big dildo.  He should be a dame.  I'm going to beat that bitch Elton John.  Come here, Elton.  Yes, you scream like a bitch.  Talking to that waiter.  Get back to the suite.  Shit and wait for me.  Shit.  I'll stick a...  Money penny. 
[00:48:00]  Money penny.  Get over here.  Shit there and let me smack you.  I like my martinis like I like my women.  Shaking.  And then punched.  Shaking, not stirred.  Q.  What kind of inventions do you have for me today?  Something I can remotely beat my wife from miles away?  Just with a push of a button?  Or an ejector sheet?  So she can sit there and I can eject her right out of the car. 
[00:48:30]  Q, suck it.  Wait, give me a pad.  That's octopus.  Wait, we still have Sean in here.  Give me a pad.  Give me a pad.  Fish.  Fish.  Fish.  Quick, right faster, Opie.  Sorry.  I'm reading here. 
[00:49:00]  Money penny.  Look what I did to you again.  I'm over here now.  It just sounds funny.  The Opie and Anthony show.  You know, seeing these beautiful women here reminds me of the very first love of my life. 
[00:49:30]  Okay.  My mother.  Not your mother.  All right.  I'm going to sing about her.  All right.  I lie next to her in the bed.  She's the kind of girl I like to wed. 
[00:50:00]  Never mind the fact that she's dead.  It turns me on.  It turns me on.  Sure.  She's a little cold to the touch.  But that doesn't bother me much.  Because the embalmer did such a lovely job.  A lovely job. 
[00:50:30]  She's a month dead and she's starting to smell.  But if loving a corpse is a sin, I'll see you in hell.  And now, I've got her propped up in a chair. 
[00:51:00]  She's losing her skin and her hair.  And I'm wishing that she wouldn't stare so much at me.  So much at me.  Yeah.  Rigor mortis is taking its toll.  And her body is as stiff as a pole.  But I'll never put her back in the hole.  I dug her from.  I dug her from. 
[00:51:30]  She's a month dead and she's starting to smell.  But if loving a corpse is a sin, I'll see you in hell.  I love you.  Yeah.  Steven Lynch, everyone. 
[00:52:00]  Opie and Anthony.  We're a bunch of perverted crackers.  You ready?  Oh, what?  And it's hard to listen to us trying to talk teen girls into doing stuff with each other.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  What are you talking about?  Captain Hook?  You guys hire some weird people, man.  Our intern showed up today with a patch on his eye.  Arr! 
[00:52:30]  And then above the patch on his forehead, a huge bandage.  And he swears that he was in what?  A car accident?  A car accident.  A motorcyclist, I guess, hit him.  Arr, Maisie!  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  But we think he's, like, faking.  There's been, now, there's been some speculation as to the validity of your injuries.  Everyone was speculating during the day that, um, wondering if it's real.  Because some people have looked under the patch. 
[00:53:00]  I have not looked under the patch and said there's nothing wrong with the story.  What happened to you?  Yeah, what happened?  Got hit by a car.  You look completely ridiculous.  You got hit by a motorcycle.  Yes.  But not you personally, your car.  My car.  Okay, so you're driving.  Driving, making a left-hand turn.  You're making a left.  And the motorcycle decides on going left to me.  He decides to do what?  To pass on my left.  Oh, to pass on your left.  Yes.  So you're making a left, he's passing you on the left, and he runs into what?  My driver's side.  Your driver's side door.  Mm-hmm.  So what happens? 
[00:53:30]  Wait.  My, oh, okay.  Yeah.  My head goes through my driver's side window.  Oh, it did?  Yes.  How fast was he going?  Uh, pfff, don't know.  22 miles an hour.  Mm-hmm.  And you're making your left.  Yes.  And he hits your door, your head goes through the window?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Yes.  So you hit your head, and what happened to your eye?  Uh, glass got in.  Glass in your eye.  And what happened underneath that patch on your head?  That's, that's where my head went through the windshield.  What kind of an injury?  Just, just a couple scrapes.  Couple of scrapes.  Yeah, sort of.  Hard head. 
[00:54:00]  Anything, any, uh, hospital?  Yes.  You went to the hospital?  Did they stitch your head up or anything?  I stitched my head up a little bit.  Uh, washed out my eye.  Washed out your eye.  Why the patch?  Because, uh, I can't really, can't really open up my eye.  So, just.  You can't open it?  No, not, not well, because the glass in the eye.  Kind of hurts.  Yeah, a little bit.  Can we look at the, uh, scratches on your head?  You gotta see them.  No, I really can't take it off.  You can't take it off.  I don't want to take it off.  Okay, no, no, I'm still, look, I'm still willing to believe this. 
[00:54:30]  I'm still willing to believe this.  You got scratches, but they had to be stitched.  How many stitches did you get?  Three.  Three stitches.  All on one cut, or two on one cut?  No, it was all on one cut.  All on one cut.  Three stitches.  Minor, yes.  Is there any way to lift it up to take a look underneath?  If you really, I'd rather not.  I mean, it's.  All right, Ben.  Ben, to you.  I'm sorry to take it off out there and rub your eye.  Well, you were.  No, no, no.  Oh, no, no, no.  I'm talking about the bandage on his head. 
[00:55:00]  Well, lift up the patch at least.  Yeah, let's look at the eye.  I really can't open up.  I showed Rick before.  I really can't open up my eye.  I always do.  You just, you can't really.  I mean, he's just blinking.  That eye's blinking a lot.  I have a question.  Yes.  All right, Rick, to you.  You said you had glass in your eye.  Yes.  How come you were rubbing your eye before if there's glass in it?  Because it bugs the hell out of you.  Oh.  Didn't they get all the glass out?  Yeah, they did, but it scratches.  The scratch is still in my eye.  The scratches, huh? 
[00:55:30]  Scratches in your eye.  Yes.  Well, that happens.  The cornea gets scratched open.  Yes.  And it takes time to heal.  And that's the only injuries you had was the glass in the eye and the stitches above your patch?  Yeah.  The only thing that happened was my driver's window shattered.  Let's see the stitches.  I really can't.  I'll come in.  Next time I'm here, I'll show you the scar.  You know, it would be totally...  No, I'll do it, Steve.  You know, it would be...  I'm covering my head now.  It's going to hurt.  You know something?  Wait, we've all had stitches. 
[00:56:00]  You could take the...  My doctor told me not to.  I don't want to get infected.  I swear...  No, I'll cover my head now because I'm supposed to anybody in the studio.  No, no.  Don't worry.  No one's going to pull it off.  Yes, they will.  No, no.  Really, no one pull it off.  But the thing is, this would totally be resolved just if we saw a suspicious.  Because I must say, everyone has been talking behind your back saying that you're faking it.  It seems very suspicious.  Now, Rick, was there something behind, like, I heard a story that he couldn't make it in one day?  He couldn't make it in...  Well, last week, he never made it in on Monday, which was a snow day, saying that, you know, the trains weren't running. 
[00:56:30]  Well, that's fine, but...  But, you know what?  Monday wasn't that bad and trains were running.  I didn't say the trains weren't running.  I mean, I couldn't get to the train station, but...  What hospital was it?  Northern Westchester.  Northern Westchester.  Okay.  Emergency room.  I mean, I feel like kind of...  What?  Like an idiot.  No, no.  Don't ever feel like an idiot.  Everyone's looking at me really funny.  Well, just take the patch off, show us the stitches, and then we all look like idiots.  But I really would rather not because...  I would never say something I come in, I will show you the scar. 
[00:57:00]  No, because you might cut yourself and get the stuff.  Yeah, that's not what I do.  I'm empathetic.  Stinky.  When he first came in, he said he didn't want to take the patch off because he still  has glass in his...  Right.  Well, I think there probably is...  That's what he said to me.  Is there glass in your eye?  This is a little weird, man.  I'm telling you.  You were rubbing your eye.  Because it itches because of the scratch.  I think this kid came in with a fake injury, man.  No, come on.  I swear to God.  No, I'm still...  I totally am willing to believe you.  How about we all...  Now, here's a little more of what happened last week.  All right, Rick? 
[00:57:30]  Rick?  Wednesday, he was supposed to be in.  Yes.  I never got a phone call.  He knows my number.  He's left me messages before.  Well, Rick, come on.  Nothing...  I don't like calling you either.  No.  When was this accident?  It was at my hometown.  When?  When Wednesday.  My car...  And that's why you didn't call Rick?  Yeah, it really was.  But how come you found the time to call Steve and call AJ from the other show?  All right, here we go.  You guys are willing to listen to me.  All right, let's...  I'm just trying to figure this out because it just is...  Do you get me? 
[00:58:00]  It sounds a little suspicious.  All you have to do is pull down the bandage.  I will show you...  And then we look like tools.  All right.  On Wednesday.  We've all had stitches.  All you have to do is go like this.  Show the edge of the stitch and boom.  What's going to happen?  I'll show you on Wednesday.  This is going to come out.  All right, let him talk.  Now, what happened?  My car...  Steve, you got something on this?  No, I'll let him tell his story.  Your car?  My car...  I left the dome light on in my car so my car didn't start because the battery was dead.  Okay.  And when I got it jumped, I was on the way to the station. 
[00:58:30]  That's...  I called when I found out my car was dead.  Okay.  And then on the way to the station, you have an accident?  What did you call?  By accident, I called Steve.  And your whole head went through the windshield?  No.  No, the side window.  The side window.  Because the motorcycle hit him on the side, so it threw his head through the side window.  What was the name of the guy on the motorcycle?  You can't give out means like that, right?  Well, we can always dump it out.  Ben?  No, you know what I love about this, too, is that he can't find to call any of us.  And I love the excuse that our interns all of a sudden have. 
[00:59:00]  I don't know the number.  I'm actually going to be in defense of this, too, because I really...  I have trouble calling, because I don't know anyone's but Opie's number.  But, Ant, we fixed that problem weeks ago.  We all gave him phone numbers, said, this is a...  You've got to call us.  Mike has a good point.  And I've been hearing from Jesse.  All right, all right.  I've been hearing from John.  All right, that's boring.  But Mike has a good point on line nine.  Well, let me...  We'll go to Mike.  All right.  Mike, what's up?  It's WNAW.  Dude.  Hey.  What happened to the dude on the motorcycle?  And why was he out on Wednesday in the snow and the rain on a motorcycle? 
[00:59:30]  It makes no sense.  It wasn't raining and sunny on Wednesday.  It was crappy out Wednesday.  He really wasn't.  All right.  What happened to the guy on the bike?  Yeah, what happened to the guy on the bike?  He really just...  My car was more destroyed than his...  But what happened to him?  Wait, the guy had to go flying.  He really didn't.  We weren't going that fast.  But wait, what happened to him?  He came from...  He was just kind of...  And he left?  Yeah.  Wait, wait, he just...  All right.  Hold on.  Okay, all right, all right, all right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I have an accident report. 
[01:00:00]  I'll bring it in this time.  If you guys...  What, you have an accident report, too?  That's fake, too?  Yes, that's fake, too.  Wow.  I know people in high places.  If you guys...  I think it's a plot for airtime.  Well, it's working.  Let me tell you.  It's working.  Now, he hit the door.  Yes.  It was enough for...  Let me just get this straight.  It's enough force to physically move the vehicle enough that your head...  It moved your car enough.  Yes.  Because in order for your head to go through the driver's...  The driver's side window, 
[01:00:30]  your car has to move to put your head through the window.  It's not your head that moves.  When your head goes through anything,  it is the actual vehicle moving into your head.  So he hits your car with enough force to move the vehicle  so your head goes through the window.  Yes.  It's basic physics.  But nothing happens,  and he rides his motorcycle away?  Swear to God.  I have an accident report.  I'll bring it in.  It's not fake.  It's nothing...  Is your car here?  No.  How did you get here?  Train. 
[01:01:00]  How did you get to the train station?  Car.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, listen.  Hey.  This guy is so full of it.  He doesn't want to show you the stitches  because he doesn't have any.  I know.  There's no reason now.  I work in the emergency room.  There's no reason now why he can't show you no stitches  if he has them.  Hmm.  And that's like a...  Where'd you get that bandaged?  Wayne Reed right around the corner.  I actually got it before I came here  and see you guys and believed me.  It's barely on your forehead.  With this one, this one's just the right one.  It's kind of popping up. 
[01:01:30]  We might be able to even look underneath.  And will you agree that maybe you might see some swelling  in that area?  You can't tell because the bandage is huge.  But even around his eye.  Jerry.  Why is that headwind?  Hey, Jerry.  Hi.  Yay.  I just got into a car accident  and I got 50 stitches across my eyelids  and they didn't put any bandages on me.  No, it's not on his eyelids.  Oh, no, because...  No, he's got...  This is what he's got.  He's got a patch over his eye  because he had a little glass in there  and he scratched up his eye 
[01:02:00]  even though you can't really tell  when he lifted up the patch.  And then he has a bandage above the eye  where he has some stitches.  A bandage is above the eye.  What make motorcycle was this, sir?  Well, put it this way.  I just received 50 stitches.  It was a Honda.  No one drives Hondas.  It was a...  People drive the Hondas.  So it was a Honda  and he hits the door.  What did he say to you  after he hit you?  Are you okay?  Are you okay?  And then he took off.  No.  I mean, he waited around for the police. 
[01:02:30]  He waited for the cops.  All right.  All right.  That's why I have a police report  which I will bring to you  next time I'm here  so you guys don't think about it.  All you have to do  is show us the bandage.  I don't...  Everyone is like...  Rachel.  Okay.  Yeah.  What's up?  People's heads don't go through  driver's side windows.  Well, no.  It can happen.  It can happen.  How would a motorcycle driver  drive away  if it hit him with enough impact  to make his head...  Well, that's what I'm saying.  A lot more damage  would be done to the guy.  He turned his head  so it was head on. 
[01:03:00]  Don't buy it.  No way.  All right.  I got something for him.  It looks like you have  nice poofy shampooed hair.  Did you take a shower recently?  I washed my head.  I didn't take a shower.  Did you take off the bandage?  No.  I was told not to.  I swear...  That's a dry bandage.  But it's not wet.  It's not wet.  It's soggy.  It would be all messy.  I washed my hair off.  That is a brand new bandage.  But wouldn't it come off  if it got wet a little?  It hasn't yet.  How can you keep it  from getting wet  and washing your hair? 
[01:03:30]  Very good question, Opie.  Thank you.  Okay.  Detective Opie.  Let's see.  Take the bandage off.  No, I don't want to.  You've got to take that bandage off.  No, I really...  I mean,  and considering how much  he's touching it  and pushing on it,  it doesn't work.  I don't love this.  Anne-Marie.  Yes.  Hey.  Hi, Brian.  Hi, Anne-Marie.  Hi.  Hey, what happened to him?  Well, I don't know  about the accident  because I wasn't working  whenever he got in the accident.  Go home, Anne-Marie.  But I can tell you  he's very accident prone.  Hang up, Anne-Marie.  All right.  Hang up the phone. 
[01:04:00]  Why's that?  What's the matter, Brian?  Keep her on the phone.  I work with her.  Trying to figure this out.  What do you mean  he's accident prone?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, fine.  Tell her about...  Tell them about the incident.  The other incident.  How many incidents  have you had, Brian?  Oh, my God.  We're on to something.  Tell them about  the hot boiling water  on my crotch.  You can tell them that story.  Oh, that's true.  Oh, that's right.  You can tell them that.  He's a regular  over at the Hudson Valley Hospital.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  He's like...  He falls...  Well, you know,  like, a lot of people 
[01:04:30]  can fall down the stairs,  but Brian can actually  fall up the stairs  and get hurt.  It's like that  Munchausen by proxy syndrome.  Only without a child,  he just does it to himself.  All right.  Hold on, Anne-Marie.  For the attention.  You do that?  What town was this in?  Yorktown.  I live in Yorktown, yeah.  Yorktown.  Okay.  Bill, you work in Yorktown?  No, no, no.  I live in Yorktown.  But listen...  Okay.  I got a friend  that's a state trooper.  Yeah.  Was it the state trooper  that helped this kid?  Yeah.  Yeah? 
[01:05:00]  I got a friend  that's a state trooper.  He would have told me.  He just came on a motorcycle  to see me.  He would have told me  if there was a motorcycle accident.  Besides,  there's so much sand  on the roads,  especially right after  the blizzard,  there was no way  that anybody's driving  a motorcycle around here  because you'd be dead.  I've seen people  drive a motorcycle.  I have the police report,  I swear to you.  I'll bring it in  next time I see you.  All you have to  is take the bandage off.  I don't want to.  What police department?  Like, what area?  Is there any way  we can call right now  and verify  that there was an accident?  What area?  What road did it happen on? 
[01:05:30]  What road was it?  It was in Pleasantville.  What road?  What road?  Pleasantville Road.  Dude, you came to work  making an accident, man.  Dude, hold on.  Maybe I'm embellishing it  a little bit.  That's scary.  Embellishing a little bit.  All right,  now we're getting on to it.  What is embellishing  a little bit?  We work with a bunch  What's embellishing  a little bit?  How much is embellished?  Be honest.  No, I really got hit  by a motorcycle, Mike.  Maybe my head  didn't go through the window.  Was this last year? 
[01:06:00]  All right, all right, all right.  Maybe the head  didn't go through the window.  So it hit the window.  No, well, I think...  So there's no glass  in your eye?  There is glass.  From where?  What broke?  No, my window did break.  But my head and my nod  went through the window.  It might have been his...  Wait, let me...  Mike, Mike, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  I always can't  order glass for a living.  Yeah.  All right?  It takes almost a hammer  to go through  a side window.  They're not meant to break.  Right.  This guy must have  got creamed  if he could have  even come close  to get his head  through a side window.  So you're saying  maybe it was the guy, 
[01:06:30]  the motorcycle guy's helmet.  Maybe it was...  Of course, the car.  But he just drove away?  No, he was fine.  I have the accident  or I'll give you  the guy's number  when I get home.  I'll call you.  So then what...  If your head  didn't go through,  what's on your head?  It was the glass  shattered onto my head.  Okay.  All right.  It hits.  Last shatter's  on your head.  And it was enough to...  Oh, lift it up.  Lift it up.  Lift it up.  You've got to lift  that damn thing up.  You've got to.  I'm dying to see this now.  Lift.  There's got to be...  I really don't want to.  I'm feeling really... 
[01:07:00]  That's the purpose here.  We're trying to...  We're working this out.  We're working with...  We're working with  single white male.  I'm telling you.  We're working through this.  He's an effing freak.  Keith the cop.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  We're trying to recreate  the accident scene here.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's a cop.  Yes.  Details.  Okay.  So what you're saying  is you're in the left-hand lane  attempting to make  a left-hand turn?  No.  I'm in my right lane  making a left-hand turn. 
[01:07:30]  Making a left...  An illegal turn.  Okay.  Wait, you're making  an illegal turn there?  No, no, it's legal.  Are you in the turning lane?  You're going left.  It's a one-way street.  One lane.  I mean, not one lane.  I'm sorry.  One lane each direction.  Yes.  So it doesn't matter  left or right.  All right.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Pleasantville Road.  What university is there?  Quickly.  Peace University.  Okay.  All right.  University.  Pleasantville Road  and you're at an intersection.  What road are you turning on to?  This is a familiar route  because you're on your way to work.  I was on my way to work  and school and all that.  You take this every day. 
[01:08:00]  So Pleasantville, you make a left on...  Manville.  Manville.  Manville.  Okay.  All right.  Approximately how far back  is the motorcycle  when you make the turn?  Probably like 20 feet.  And he passes you  over the double yellow.  I think what might have happened  was that his foot...  What he said was his foot  slipped off the brake pedal  and he kept going into my car.  His foot slipped off the brake pedal.  He didn't use the hand.  He doesn't use that front brake.  So his foot slipped  and he went in.  So it was just... 
[01:08:30]  So he's almost like next to you.  Yeah.  And he builds up enough speed  to fly into your car  and even shatter a window  and fly off his motorcycle  so his helmet hits the window.  Just...  How fast were you going?  I was stopped  because I was making the turn.  But I mean,  how fast were you going on that road  before you came to a stop?  30?  35?  Maybe.  There's no way.  Okay.  I have a conclusion.  Not if this guy  runs off his bike  like Gary Busey.  Keith, the cop.  I have a conclusion.  After being affiliated 
[01:09:00]  with the show  for almost two years,  we have a lack of security.  Because this guy  should just not be...  Who does the screening?  Now, Keith,  you've talked to a lot of people  that you might be arresting,  you might not be,  and you get stories out of them  that you can tell right away  if they're true or false.  You're a seasoned cop.  This is really...  This is shit.  Keith,  you ever watch Cops  and you see him  questioning the guy  and it's like,  this is so...  This isn't panning out.  There should be beads of sweat  rolling down this guy's forehead.  Is there?  Let me see.  No.  There is... 
[01:09:30]  I'm fat,  so I'm telling you this.  Next time he comes to work,  I'd like to see the car.  All right, Keith.  Thank you.  Okay, I'll take this.  Bye-bye.  A lot of people saying  you'd be in a neck brace.  Yeah, what happened to your neck?  Nothing?  Nothing.  Swear to God.  My head may not  went through the window.  All right.  Might not have went through the window.  I have a police report.  All right,  so now,  like,  your head didn't go  through the window,  so let's see the stitches.  No.  You have no stitches.  No.  We've drawn the conclusion now  that you do not have stitches 
[01:10:00]  under those bandages.  No,  it's not what we want to believe.  We have drawn the conclusion  through questioning  and working through this  that you cannot possibly have  three stitches  on any cut  under that bandage.  Okay.  You don't, do you?  No.  Okay, fine.  You have scratches.  Yeah, right.  What is it?  It's a scratch.  It's a scratch.  Yes,  I just got to embellish a little bit.  So you embellish with the stitches.  Then you can take it off.  Did you...  It's a cut.  Did you indeed go to the hospital?  Yes, I did.  Take off the bandage. 
[01:10:30]  You can take it off.  I'm embarrassed,  because it's probably  not going to be anything there.  Don't even be embarrassed.  Just take it.  Take the cut on my finger, too,  if you really want.  You can redeem yourself  by just being honest  and taking the bandage off.  We'll laugh at you  and then we'll move on.  We'll laugh and we'll move on.  Let's go.  I want to see a cut on my finger  that I got from it, too.  Take the bandage.  Just the bandage on your head.  Just the one in your head.  Take the bandage.  You've got to take it off now.  Here it comes.  It's going to hurt.  Let's take it off.  Let's take...  You see that?  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Turn your head. 
[01:11:00]  I am scared for my safety.  There's nothing...  Dude, I was honestly expecting  maybe a cut.  Yeah, at least a little cut.  A little cut.  There's nothing?  There's nothing...  I mean nothing there.  There's nothing there.  Dude, there is nothing there.  Holy ass.  There's absolutely nothing...  I am scared for my safety.  People, I can't stress to you enough.  Like not even...  There's nothing there.  There's not even an abrasion.  There is nothing under that.  I saw the police report.  It went from three stitches  to the head going to the window  and there's nothing under there. 
[01:11:30]  Because I was pushing.  That is skin on the same side of each...  It does not look any different.  There is not even any swelling or anything.  Dude, there's nothing.  Nothing hit...  I have a police report.  Okay, get the thing on my face.  Was it Earl's friend on the motorcycle?  Was that it?  Earl's friend, the disposable man?  Dude, now let's go...  Now let's go phase two here.  Dude, take the patch off.  Take the patch off.  You look ridiculous.  You don't need the patch.  Take the patch off.  Obviously, you didn't have that.  Take the patch off.  Open your eye.  No, I really can't open my eye.  Open your eye.  That is true.  It's not tearing. 
[01:12:00]  It's not red.  It's not red.  The whites of your eye are white.  I can't even open my eye.  How many fingers?  I can see...  That are my right eye.  I can see five.  Close your right eye.  Open the other eye.  I can't.  Open the eye.  Where do you?  Goddamn eye.  There's nothing wrong with your eye.  Please don't do this anymore.  I swear.  You're scaring us.  Open your stupid eye.  Open the eye.  Open the eye.  Single white male.  Open the eye.  There's nothing wrong with it.  You have nothing on your eye.  I swear to you, there's something wrong with my eye.  There's nothing on your forehead. 
[01:12:30]  You had a huge patch.  There's nothing on your eye.  Saying you couldn't even take the patch off the shower.  There's nothing on your forehead.  Holy S.  That is the best.  All right.  It's opening up a little bit.  Yeah, it's opening up a little bit.  All right.  I swear, if you guys...  It's opening.  Yes.  All right.  Open it up.  He embellished about the eye.  Open it.  No.  Pull the bottom lid down a little.  That really does hurt.  Well, pull it down.  I just want to see if it's red.  Pull the bottom lid down.  Now, open the other eye.  Open up my eye. 
[01:13:00]  Hold it open.  That really does hurt.  Take the pain.  Hold it open a little.  Hold your eye open.  Just hold it open.  It's...  I want to see if there's any irritate...  Look, it's totally white.  Dude, do you see any red?  I swear, it hurts.  It looks like his other eye.  There's no red.  There's nothing wrong with you.  I mean, they're a little bloodshot, but his other eye is bloodshot, too, so...  There's nothing wrong with you.  They're both the same.  But please wear the patch.  Feel free to wear the patch.  Where's my parrot? 
[01:13:30]  Please feel free to wear the patch.  All right.  Look at Hope.  He's freaking out over here.  Hey, and one...  Hope.  Who the hell screams these people?  Not only that.  What's up, up in?  Brian is a little weird.  Do you remember the first couple days you showed up to work, he, like, brought in pies  and was buying us coffee and was just like...  Well, that's nice.  You want to make a good impression.  I'm not going to delve off into any other directions here that don't have any validity  with this case that we're working on right here, the injury case. 
[01:14:00]  The injury case.  I still got to know, did you embellish with the motorcycle gun?  No.  I have the police report.  I will bring it in.  All right.  We are looking forward to seeing the police report.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much for the frigging half-hour radio.  Steve, you're not going home early today, are you?  No.  Okay, good.  Not at all.  Steve, we got to get at least a still picture of the unveiling of the...  Okay, what were you working on before we pulled you in? 
[01:14:30]  Nothing.  Nothing?  I'm checking out this feedback.  All right.  Okay, great.  We'll let you continue ahead on your job.  All right.  You can wear the patch if your eye is hurting a little bit.  Okay.  All right?  Okay.  Thank you very much.  That was great.  Take your bandage with you.  We wouldn't want to get any infections from all the blood on there.  That is great.  What's the matter?  Nothing.  I'm a little hurt.  You're a little hurt?  I feel like an ass, to be honest with you.  Well, you know something?  When you do... 
[01:15:00]  Open your eye!  And then we can, like, move on.  You're still, like, faking that you can't open the eye.  The thing is, I understand you feel like an ass.  Holy ass.  But when you do certain things, and they don't pan out and there's consequences, the one consequence  is looking like an ass.  Yes.  So you did this, now you move on and you learn.  That may be embellishing when things happen.  You said you had stitches.  There's nothing on your forehead.  Nothing at all.  Next time, you fake a knee injury, you wrap it up in an ace bandage, no one could call you on  it.  You just say, it hurt.  I hurt my leg.  Okay.  But a head wound is like, wow, that's a tough one because it's right there. 
[01:15:30]  Over my board is that one.  And the patch, even, you know something?  If you're just a head wound, maybe that would be, but then you add the patch, it's a little  much.  Okay.  A little much.  We might have believed you if you just had the patch.  Or the eye patch.  Not both, though.  It's just both would put it over the top.  But next time, a leg injury, back injury, something you can't really, say, take the  bandage off.  Jay, dude, stop talking to this guy.  Call security.  Hide behind something.  You'll never see a freaking accident report. 
[01:16:00]  He's lying.  He's a psycho, bro.  All right?  Thank you.  Wait, wait, wait.  He says he feels like an ass.  That's because he's busted.  Now he's about to strike.  You're not going to strike, are you?  I have a hand in my hand.  All right.  Can we check his clothes and stuff?  You're not going to go crazy, are you?  He's who he is, man.  Get rid of him.  Do you own any guns?  No guns.  Do you have any guns on you?  No.  Do you have any needles in your pocket?  Okay, let's frisk them over.  I'm not going to get stuck in here, am I? 
[01:16:30]  Nice and beans.  Can we check his clothes for weapons?  I don't think he's carrying any weapons, Opie.  You thought he had stitches.  No, we didn't think he had stitches.  But, you know, I would think he was just trying to garner a little sympathy.  Are you the man of a thousand faces?  Excuse for the day off.  All right.  We can move on now.  All right.  Thank you very much.  You can go back to whatever.  And don't feel too bad, you know.  You pay, you know.  You do something.  It doesn't pan out.  You pay.  Now you'll forever be the eyepatch guy. 
[01:17:00]  What good message board name could it be?  Captain Psycho.  Captain Psycho.  I'm honored.  All right.  All right.  Well, continue with looking at instant feedback.  Thank you.  With your good eye.  You can turn around and there you go.  There you go.  There he goes.  Out the door.  Watch.  Don't hit your head with the door.  That would hurt.  Lock that studio door. 
[01:17:30]  Holy S.  Where the hell are you firing these people?  That was great.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  All right, Bob.  Are you ready to play Hi, Mom, I'm Gay?  Absolutely.  Now I hear you're 35 years old.  Yeah.  Never been married.  Ever.  Are you gay?  No rope swallowing.  All right, Bob.  Let's give it a shot.  All right.  You got to try to convince her, man.  All right.  I'll do my best. 
[01:18:00]  Let's give your mom a call, man.  Hello?  Mom, can you hear me down?  Yeah.  It's Bobby.  Bobby?  Yeah.  Where are you?  I'm at work.  Yeah?  Well, you sound awful funny.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  Hey, Mom, you sitting down?  Why?  I got to tell you something.  What?  Don't get nervous.  Something I've been meaning to tell you.  I was going to call.  I told you when you called earlier today.  Yeah?  I'm gay.  Oh, you're full of s***. 
[01:18:30]  I'm a Twinkie.  I swear it.  Bobby, will you stop it?  You know, I have enough aggravation.  What?  How come you never believe me?  Because I don't believe you.  Why?  Well, you just had a child, Bobby.  Yeah.  That was to throw you off.  Yeah.  Okay.  You know, I wanted to tell you that.  I was hoping you wouldn't take it lightly, but...  Bobby.  What?  Are you trying to be funny?  I'm not.  I had to tell you, you know, I just don't feel right.  I've known it ever since I was a kid.  Bobby, are you with Donna?  Not at the moment. 
[01:19:00]  Not at the moment.  All right.  With Lenny.  You can tell you faster that.  I'm not even going to bring it up.  All right.  You're the one that's always said some terrible things about those people.  So what's the, you know, what's all of a sudden?  Well, it's to throw everyone off, you know?  Bobby, I don't believe it.  However, you know...  You still love me?  I haven't had enough heartache.  I think, you know...  You still love me?  Of course I love you.  You just won't kiss me on the lips anymore, huh?  Bobby, what the hell are you doing?  Drink them?  No.  No.  Yeah.  All right.  All right. 
[01:19:30]  Okay.  I'm working.  Your father's out to lunch.  Have you told Gene this?  No.  I was going to spring it on him tonight.  Yeah.  That's nice.  Yeah.  You do that.  Stand a long distance away, will you?  I will.  Out of arm's reach.  Bobby, don't give me that baloney, please.  You break my heart when you do things like this.  I'll talk to you later when I can sit down with you.  Yeah.  That'd be nice.  All right.  All right.  I love you.  See you later.  I love you, too.  Okay.  Holy Jesus.  Dude.  I got to get back to her quick, man.  She's got to put a knife in her wrist. 
[01:20:00]  You better do that.  Hey, Bob.  Yeah.  Bob, I'm gay.  I'm gay.  This guy sounds like the manliest dude around.  I've been meaning to tell you for a long time, Bob.  I'm gay.  That'll explain the rough throat.  Yeah.  I'm a tweaky, Bob.  That's how I got the throat this past.  I've been swallowing too many ropes.  Hey, Bob.  Bob.  You sit down, Bob.  Oh, bitch. 
[01:20:30]  Hold on.  You want to call your mom back and then call us?  Yeah, I've got to get her head out of the oven.  All right.  We'll recognize her head out of the oven.  Talk.  Talk.  Opie.  Talking.  Talking out of one's butt crack.  Anthony.  Is a sign of personal confidence.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This show will really give your brain damage.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Opie.  Anthony.  One, two, seven.  P.P.P.A.W.  P.P.A.W. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, it's the O.N.A. Show.  Two, one, two, seven, five, seven, one, oh, two, seven.  You know, you've got to get Stinky in here.  I'm proud of Stink.  He's becoming more and more honest as he continues working on our radio show.  He was, Stinky was a little, uh, what, shy?  I, shy at first, wouldn't really speak his mind, but he has, uh, he has changed.  Stink?  One of our favorite smartasses back in the office after the show, Stinky. 
[01:21:30]  Stink, what are you feeling right now with this kid?  I, I hate him.  I don't want to see him.  Oh, wow.  He lied to me, like, constantly the whole day before the show.  Really?  I was asking him, you know, what happened?  Oh, I got stitches, I can't show them, my eyes got glass in it, then it's like, you know,  what am I going to do?  A little scary.  And, and you're a little, like, uncomfortable now.  Yeah, I don't want to talk, talk to him.  See, you guys are like, I'm uncomfortable.  Yeah, you've got to be a little sympathetic, I'll be, you know, I mean, there's a reason 
[01:22:00]  that he's doing this, you know.  I'm not out here to save the world and stuff, but I kind of know there's some kind of reason  that it's going on.  Anthony.  Yeah.  There was a reason why Joel Rifkin did what he did.  I know, that's what I'm saying, I'm saying I'm not, I'm not getting behind him.  There was a reason why that kid shot up to school in San Diego.  Absolutely.  And it was because when he lied one time or something, people just jumped on him, maybe.  Yeah. 
[01:22:30]  People are tuning in halfway through going, what the hell is going on?  It went from an A-team type crash.  Why don't you explain really fast?  Summarize.  I know.  Summarize what happened.  Well, Opie, our intern came in today.  Yeah, he...  What's his name?  Brian.  This is Brian.  He came in.  He had a big bandage on his forehead.  Huge.  Huge.  Yeah, very big bandage.  He took up half his forehead.  On his forehead and an eye patch over the left eye, his left eye, claiming he had an accident 
[01:23:00]  with a car and a motorcycle.  He was making a left.  So he went out to get coffee or something, and we all started whispering in the back office.  We're like, holy yes, the guy's faking.  It just didn't seem legit.  Didn't add up.  Didn't add up.  He was trying to get off of work, I think, or an excuse for not coming in.  Because he didn't show up Wednesday.  Is that it, Rick?  Didn't show up Monday or Wednesday.  Didn't hear from him at all.  Yeah.  So basically...  And Rick's just a prick to work for.  So basically...  So he, like, really rags these guys. 
[01:23:30]  Basically, he should be fired, but he had an excuse, and the excuse was that he was in  this accident.  Yeah, he...  Hence, the patch on his eye and the big, huge bandage on the forehead.  And the big bandage on his head.  And people were calling him on it.  Yeah.  Yeah, in the office.  We were talking.  And then we decided we'd just go on the air and hash it out.  Well, he comes in and says...  He was making a left.  The motorcycle was going straight around him.  They crashed.  His head went through the driver's side window, cutting his head. 
[01:24:00]  Requiring three stitches in the ER, Opie.  And he had glass in his eye, which scratched the cornea.  And that's what the eye patch was for.  After some questioning about some things that didn't quite pan out...  Everyone is scared now.  Look at everyone's face.  Might have been embellishing.  No one has to go outside.  Everyone's in the studio.  He might have been embellishing.  He's the only one outside the studio now.  And that door's locked.  Freaked out.  So he said he might have been embellishing the story.  Who comes up with this crap?  He wouldn't take the bandage off his eye, off his head, off his forehead. 
[01:24:30]  He wouldn't take the bandage off.  No one's going outside.  So no work's being done.  He said he didn't want to get infected.  He was lying right there standing in front of us, too, saying,  I can't take it off.  It'll get infected.  My doctor said no.  My doctor said...  When we finally did get him to take the bandage off because he fessed that he was embellishing  and his head did not go through the window.  Just some glass broke from the motorcycle guy's helmet hitting the window or whatever.  He got cut.  We wanted to see the cuts. 
[01:25:00]  He finally said he was embellishing.  Took the bandage off.  Opie, there was not even a ding.  There wasn't a scratch where if you scratched yourself on your head because he had an itch,  there wasn't even that red that you had.  I have more of a mark on my face, you probably noticed today, from a washcloth because I scrubbed too hard.  Look, over here.  Right.  He doesn't even have that on his forehead.  You get more marks just from shaving than that.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't stress to how much of a mark...  No, he had nothing!  ...there was nothing.  Nothing.  And then the eye patch comes off.  He was blinking real hard with that eye, saying that there was glass in it, even though there 
[01:25:30]  wasn't glass.  But the eye started loosening up, and he's not blinking his marks.  And he pulled down the bottom of the eye, and there was no red at all.  No red in the eye.  So, obviously...  He went from a major car accident, so he made up the story because he missed Monday and  Wednesday, and now no one wants to leave the studio to work.  It was a story.  Let's go back to Anne-Marie. 
[01:26:00]  Anne-Marie.  Yes.  Hey.  How you doing?  All right.  Well, I can tell you that Brian probably, when he gets hurt, see what happens is he's kind  of afraid that it's going to be worse than it really is.  Anne-Marie, he wasn't hurt at all.  Oh, but I bet you he thinks he was.  I wouldn't put it past him.  I bet you he poked himself in the eye a couple of times before he came to work.  No, he didn't do it on purpose.  But he gets, like, he's very tender.  Right. 
[01:26:30]  You know what I mean?  Like, if he gets, like, a headache, you know, he's got a brain tumor.  Oh, like a hypochondria kind of thing?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Let's, you know.  But that's...  Yeah, and we call him Briar the Liar.  Look at...  Oh, what do you call him?  Briar the Liar.  Well, because he exaggerates a lot?  A little bit, yeah.  Jesse?  Yeah.  Do you remember when he said he had to take a day off because he had surgery on his head  or his brain?  No, it was his foot.  What?  What?  It's something like that.  It's his foot.  It was his foot?  Yeah. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, he said his brain.  You're right.  He said he had surgery on his head.  Something like that.  Well, maybe his head is...  All right, let's go.  Get Briar.  Briar, what happened?  What happened when?  You had surgery.  On my ankle, yes.  On your ankle.  Yes, that was true.  And that was true.  What happened?  Now nothing I'm going to say.  Well, now you know what it is.  It's the boy that cried wolf thing.  You can't blame us now for not believing certain things.  Earl.  You've set this...  Earl, stay in here.  Steve, stay in here.  Get sticky in here.  Now, what happened to your leg?  To your ankle?  I tore my leg. 
[01:27:30]  What happened?  I tore my ligaments playing basketball.  Playing basketball.  And you got an operation done.  It doesn't look like you're too active.  Do you have a scar on your ankle?  Is there an operation scar there?  Yeah, on my knee.  All right, let's see.  Who's playing basketball with Michael Jordan?  Brian, you...  All right.  Brian, you told me it was when you tripped.  In here.  I thought you said ankle.  No, it's...  Yeah.  I thought you just said ankle.  I said there my knee.  Wait, I thought you just said ankle.  You said ankle.  I'm just...  All right.  I don't see any surgical scars.  That was your knee. 
[01:28:00]  Wait, where's the scar?  How long ago was this done?  My surgery scar was done a while ago.  But my knee...  But what's the recent one?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Guys, when was this?  When was this?  This was like...  A couple weeks ago.  Do you remember when...  Remember when you guys made a quick comment that someone tripped over the door?  He tripped over the door.  Right.  Oh, that was Brian.  I remember that.  And you said you came in and you said you had to have, like, your ankle...  You, like, tore a ligament or something.  I didn't tore a ligament from that.  I don't need to be writing you out.  You want to see my...  I'm not trying to write you out.  Where is the surgery scar that you had from this recent operation that was two weeks ago? 
[01:28:30]  It was orthoscopic, so you're not familiar to see.  I swear.  Oh, no.  We have no surgery scars over here.  Wait a minute.  It was orthoscopic.  So, what do you got?  A mole.  A mole!  It's a mole?  Oh, my God.  I can't.  I can't believe this. 
[01:29:00]  It's not a mole.  Okay.  Now, Brian, haven't you also been going to physical therapy every Friday?  Yes, I have been.  For what?  My ankle.  For the ankle.  Yeah.  That you had the orthoscopic surgery.  That you had the mole on.  Yeah, the mole on.  And this therapy is where?  It's in Peekskill, sorry.  Pleasantville again.  No, Peekskill.  And what do they do to help you out?  Put me on different machines.  Although I'm not very active, as Opie said, they put me on machines that make me.  On machines?  Yes.  Because your ankle, what do they say is actually wrong with it? 
[01:29:30]  I have total ligaments.  Your total ligaments?  Yes, a lot of them.  So, now you, like, walk and do things, treadmill or something.  Yeah, treadmill, they put me on different machines.  Okay.  But there's no scar?  No.  It's amazing.  It's new, Serge.  All right.  Where's, bring Jesse in here.  Epilogical Brian's a new nickname.  Mark from LeBron.  Get everyone in here.  Get Sticky in here.  So, okay, you had that surgery. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  But it was nothing with your brain or your head?  What was that, Jeff?  You said, see, Ben, I don't remember exactly, because it wasn't, like, a big deal, but you  said you couldn't come in one Friday.  I don't mean, I feel bad, because I'm like.  Oh, whatever.  It's cool.  You said you had, like, you needed surgery on your head.  On your head?  No, no, that was Rick making a joke about me.  He said I needed a lobotomy.  No, no, no.  You said it to me that you had head surgery.  I never said I had head surgery.  Now, this is getting. 
[01:30:30]  And Rick said that.  Brian, Brian, when you make a joke, that means it's not real.  All right, well.  Oh, my goodness.  I miss work one day.  All right, here's the deal.  There's a lot of people very uncomfortable right now.  So, we're going to have a little vote.  What are you going to vote?  Who wants Brian to go home today?  I'm not voting that.  He lied.  Try to your face.  Who cares?  I'm fine with it.  I don't care.  I think it made for a great radio.  What, you want to toss a diamond in the rough like this out the door? 
[01:31:00]  No, I said go home today.  Today?  Yeah.  No.  I think he's doing a great job.  Thank you, I think.  Come on.  You're going to get more stories if we live.  This is great.  If we live.  Hands up.  Who wants him out?  Today.  Today?  No.  I think I'll put my hand up, too.  Oh, you want to go home today?  Steve, take care of the eye.  You're cool.  Well, you're big, and you don't know how to handle yourself.  He's not going to.  There's only three people that want him to leave?  No, you're being honest.  Let's be honest. 
[01:31:30]  Let's be honest.  Let's get out of the room.  I'm being honest.  I think it's fine.  I'll turn my back, and I'll put my hands against the wall if you guys want to get voted.  All right, turn your back, because maybe someone doesn't want to see that they're voting.  Oh, a secret ballot?  All right, who wants him to leave?  Yeah, look, more votes are going up right now.  Four and four.  I had mine up before.  Just didn't see it.  Earl, it's to you.  The deciding vote.  Earl, the vote.  Jesus Christ.  No way.  The man that can't do anything right.  Earl's not going to vote him off the island. 
[01:32:00]  That's his brother, man.  Earl still thinks he's a virgin.  Earl, I like you.  I can't believe you guys wanted to stay today.  Why not?  I feel bad.  Screw feel bad.  I'm still an intern.  I don't want you to vote me out.  Kids effed up.  Why did you do it?  Can we ask that?  We really haven't asked the why.  Why did you go through this elaborate accident scheme?  Intimidation.  What do you mean? 
[01:32:30]  Everyone had a story on the show and you figured you needed one?  Yeah, sure.  No, not as much.  What intimidation?  Wait, you are intimidated?  I'm intimidated by this show.  You're intimidated.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Before you get into this.  Yeah.  Because it is a tie.  It's four that want him to go, four that want him to stay.  I'm telling you, we're going to the listeners.  I'm sorry.  I'm screwed.  Clear the phone lines.  One, two, three, four, five, six, two, four.  Okay.  We got nine phones ringing.  And that's what's going to decide it. 
[01:33:00]  I still got to know.  Was there ever an accident?  Yes, there was.  Was it in the last calendar year?  Yes, it was.  See, now I can't even believe that.  I can't.  Now I can't believe.  Bring in the accident report.  I went in.  I interrupted you.  Go ahead.  Say what you have to say.  You were saying you were good.  Oh, you're intimidated by the show.  Yes.  Now why is, I'm sure anybody, Jess, when you first came here, it was a little rough, a  little intimidating.  Yeah.  All right.  And how did you deal with it?  I'm still dealing with it.  What are you guys talking about?  But you just come in, you do your job, you hang out, you get your barbs in where you can, 
[01:33:30]  you kind of, you mix it up with us.  No, like you just don't say any.  I would wait until you guys would talk to me and I didn't bring food.  Okay.  But that, but that was a nice, that was a nice gesture.  My friend.  That was a nice gesture.  Thank you.  But now how, how did you feel this was going to help you?  Because I felt like if I didn't come up with, because if I didn't elaborate on my injuries  that you guys wouldn't believe me, which.  Well, yeah, he put you over the top there.  Kind of kick me in the ass there, huh? 
[01:34:00]  But why did you come up with the story at all?  It wasn't a story.  It really did.  I mean, what?  Oh, it's a story.  You don't have stitches.  Okay, that is a story, but the accident was true.  Take the patch off, your stupid eye.  Take the patch off.  God.  I'm not going to, I'm not going to play along now.  Take the patch off.  My eye really does bother me.  I really can't take off the patch.  His eye bothers him, Opie.  You guys are all insane.  I have a scratched cornea.  If you shine a light in a person's eye, it kills. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  If you don't want to do that, do you?  We're not shining a light in his eye, for Christ.  We're starting the voting.  Okay?  The listeners will decide.  I'm packing up as we speak.  Oh, Dave.  Yeah.  Have you heard the last hour of radio?  Yeah.  Okay, what do you think?  I think the guy's a pathological liar.  I think you've got to get rid of him.  All right, get rid of him.  All right.  Thank you, Dave.  Take care.  This is one bell.  Stinky, make sure Stinky keeps track.  Okay.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike?  Mike?  I'm sorry, man. 
[01:35:00]  This guy's crazy, but he's funny.  So, no.  See, that's what I'm saying.  All we want to know is should we, you know, send him home today, right now?  No, no.  This is way entertaining, man.  I'm listening.  All right.  Stay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let's go to another Mike.  Mike?  Keep him there, because two words, Ted Kaczynski.  Thank you, Mike.  Have you been known to be violent at any time?  No, I'm a very sweet guy.  Very sweet.  And he's a liar.  That's what they said about Joel Rifkin.  No, and so you don't have any aggression or anything? 
[01:35:30]  You guys are insane.  Well, everyone says that one day I might just, you know, snap.  Oh, good.  So, let's just keep him around.  You're insane, Anthony.  And there's no gag anymore.  I can't believe you guys want him here after what we just heard.  Oh, wait.  Earl's raising his hand now.  Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because you were a pussy when we needed you.  So, now the listener's going to decide.  Troy?  Yeah.  Hey.  He's the guy.  See, everybody thinks.  F you all.  Sympathy vote.  I love it.  F you all. 
[01:36:00]  Let's go to Jerry.  Jerry.  Fire him.  He's a fairy.  Fire him?  Yeah, fairy.  He's a fairy.  Fire him.  All right.  Okay.  We're running out of votes here.  Let's go to Frank.  Frank?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, now I know why my instant feedback's never getting on the air anymore.  Fire his ass.  Fire his ass.  It's 3-3.  All right, guys.  Bye-bye.  Three votes to go.  Mark from the Bronx saying he should have used the Chewbacca defense quickly,  that it's just so ridiculous that you must have quit.  Jeremy.  Hey, guys. 
[01:36:30]  Hey.  I'd say keep him.  I think he's got a staff, too, on our hands.  You guys suck.  No, that was a keep.  Please, no, don't let him leave today.  It's only 5 o'clock.  That leaves him two hours to come back with weapons.  Michael.  Hey, what do you think?  I think he should go.  All right.  He's like the guy at the ski lodge with the fake cast.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  It comes down to the one final vote.  Here it is.  Don't let me down.  Wayne?  Yeah, that's me. 
[01:37:00]  All right.  You will decide Brian's fate.  Honestly, I know his doctor before I vote.  What?  I know his doctor.  You knew his doctor?  I know his doctor.  I can verify for it all.  Conflict of interest on the voting, but...  Oh, but it's Bones McCoy.  Bones McCoy.  He's going to wait until he heals anything that's wrong with him before he comes into work.  All right.  Every night.  Very funny.  You just saved your ass.  All right.  Wayne, it's...  I say keep the nut.  You... 
[01:37:30]  Keep the nut.  You know, maybe put one of them security bracelets on him so you know where he is all the time.  Well, can I take off my patch now?  He stays.  Keep on your patch?  I mean, you got a stoker, Patty.  Then, you know, it's still around.  So now you're going to admit that the patch is fake and you want to take it off now?  No, that was a joke.  I'm sorry.  Wayne, thank you.  You let me down and I was going to give you something for voting him out.  You're going to give me something to vote him out?  No, now I can't.  You voted to keep him. 
[01:38:00]  Brian, I'd appreciate it if you didn't look me in the eye or even...  Don't even come 20 feet away from...  Don't even enter the studio for the rest of the show.  Okay.  This the show?  Okay.  I can do that.  And do not be in the office after the show's over.  Uh-oh.  Until I leave for the train.  It's like Michael Corleone in Rado.  You're not to look at me.  You're dead to me.  Wow.  I'm going to slowly back out of the studio now.  This is...  You guys let me down, man.  What's the matter, Ope? 
[01:38:30]  You don't like the...  You're saying you love the Psycho Factor.  Every time something happens, you go, I love the Psycho Factor.  We just got an hour of Psycho Factor.  Now it's like, hit the street.  Oh.  What?  There he comes.  What?  Come on.  What?  You don't find this very entertaining on a very psychotic level?  You don't have to deal with them.  Look at these guys.  Look at Sticky and Jess.  They don't even want to go...  You don't even want to go outside the studio now.  We're never going to talk to them again. 
[01:39:00]  You're the talent, guys.  You know, we're not the talent.  No, the problem is, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  I wanted him to go, and I wanted him to stay.  Then we went to all you guys.  It was four and four.  Then we go to the listeners.  And the listeners let us down.  Or my side, anyway.  I saw your point.  Ben, are you happy?  No.  This sucks.  Get him out.  He's a friggin' freak.  Thank you.  That is mental.  That whole story we just heard is beyond Psycho Factor.  That's mental.  All right. 
[01:39:30]  Send him home for the day.  No, we can't.  And then we will talk about it.  No, we can't.  Why?  We did it the fair way.  Oh, I know we did it the fair way.  I'll accept the results.  I'm just pissed.  I'm pissed at the results, but I'll accept them.  Well, the voting should be whether he should be fired or not.  We don't need good radio that bad, is all I'm going to say.  Look at this guy checking in.  Make him wear the patch as long as he still works there, no matter how long it is. 
[01:40:00]  He's always got to come in now with that patch.  If he doesn't, he goes home.  Yeah, tell him that.  No, I'm serious.  He's got to wear the patch always, man.  No, the day he shows up without the patch, I swear to God, you've got to send him right home.  No, Joe.  I'm up for that.  Rick, go tell him.  No, that's got to come from Rick.  Rick hired the lunatic.  Very good.  Michael from Tenton Falls.  He said that.  Tony, what's up?  Oh, before you start ripping on me, I agree you should have sent him home today.  I tried.  But, dude, this kid has got problems, bro. 
[01:40:30]  And, dude, we've listened to your stories about your family.  Yeah.  Dude, my friend's pregnant wife works with your brother, Quinn.  You think after hearing Friday's show, she didn't look at him in a different way?  Wait a minute.  First of all, first of all.  Dude, I agree, bro.  You're up for yelling at me.  I've never faked an injury.  I know you have.  No one in my family faked an injury for sympathy.  All right?  Bro, nobody's questioning your integrity, bro.  But this kid has got problems. 
[01:41:00]  He needs a nap ski.  Maybe a permanent one.  Oh, thank you, Tony.  Not you, Ope, the kid.  No, I heard you.  Dude, man, I don't know, Ope.  Nice knowing you, bro.  This kid's going to whack you in, Stinky, first.  Jeez.  Later, dude.  All right, Tony.  Nice knowing you, brother.  Tuttle from New York.  Final test.  Does Brian like Huey Lewis and the news?  Look at my business card.  The color is bone.  Rob, what's going on?  Yo, fire his dumb ass.  You're calling Stinky a rat, though? 
[01:41:30]  No, because I thought the kid was answering the phone.  Oh.  Dude, Stinky rocks, man.  Stinky rolls.  Yeah.  They should make him Stinky's personal bitch.  All right.  Make him do stupid things.  All right.  All right, guys.  Thank you, Rob.  All right.  Look, see, you're all uncomfortable.  No, this isn't going to work.  He's got to go home today.  Oh, because...  No, because, like, Michael...  Here, Michael...  Now you're all uncomfortable.  Michael on line two.  Ope, change your diaper.  Opie.  Yeah.  What's your problem?  We're a grown man.  We're not...  Because the kid is effed up. 
[01:42:00]  Opie.  Not even in a good way.  Not even in a way we could, like, exploit on the radio.  Opie.  Who cares?  You could take him down.  All right?  I saw you on XFL.  I mean, you're not some little small wimp.  Who cares?  He's not going to want to shoot me, buddy.  He doesn't have to bandage himself.  So what?  See, now Ann wants to send him home.  But you know what?  Ann, stick to your word.  Keep him.  He's entertaining.  You're saying if it's going to interfere with the show, then he's got to go home.  No.  See, I'm not happy with the decision we made, but we made the decision. 
[01:42:30]  I have to live with that.  Yeah, but you're...  That's fine.  Yeah, but you're crying about it.  Who cares?  Michael.  Keep him away.  Michael, you...  Stinky!  God, someone will back me up.  Stinky, talk to Michael.  Everyone is uncomfortable now.  How are you going to look at this guy or, like, at the end of the show, go to the office  and sit down next to him?  What is he going to say to you?  Michael, the guy had a bandage on his forehead claiming he had three stitches.  After about an hour, he finally took the bandage off.  Guess what?  There wasn't even a scratch.  Isn't that a little mental?  Does he have a Jeffrey Dahmer look to him or what? 
[01:43:00]  At least out of one eye?  Did you see it?  I mean, come on.  You're sitting here whining about this for 20 minutes.  Move on.  All right, we'll move on.  Thank you.  Okay.  If I was him, I would leave on my own out of embarrassment.  I don't know what he's doing.  He's just sitting there now.  I know.  He's just sitting there.  No one's talking to him.  He's afraid to come by the studio door, even.  Hey, tell him to go home.  What?  Tell him to go home. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, you're not going to make me do that.  Oh, I will, but then the listeners will lash out at Mick.  Call me a crybaby.  It comes from you.  They'll go, okay, cool.  Tell him to go home.  I can't do that.  Come on.  What am I?  Tell him to go home.  Tell him to go home and not to come back.  Now, get out of here.  Come on.  That's not my job.  I don't hire and fire.  Well, that's Rick's job.  Rick should show some backbone. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, see?  Come on.  You're pushing it off onto me.  Well, who's who's?  Hey, the name on the sign says Opie and Anthony, and you're Anthony.  Look.  Yeah, his name's first.  Look.  Oh, you're going to pull that.  That's the first time you ever pulled that one, you bastard.  In this situation, it works.  Just for the record, we've never played that before.  It works, though, in this situation.  Yeah, but you know we've never played that before.  Look, I already spelt out how I feel about this.  Look, if I'm not looked at as a crybaby, I'll do it right now. 
[01:44:30]  No problem.  Oh, Steve.  Stink, what are you thinking?  Send him home.  What are you going to do anyway?  He can't do anything now.  He just has to sit there.  You know what?  I don't really care what people think of me.  Get him in here.  Yeah, make sure he doesn't go in the studio.  Brian.  Yes.  You're outside the studio about what?  He's 20 feet from you.  Right.  That's what I asked you.  So, for the first time, you're following rules.  The opiate restraining order. 
[01:45:00]  Can we do the prison visit, though?  Yeah, you want to do it that way?  Yeah, get him on the phone.  All right.  No, because then, no.  No, I can do it this way.  Brian, you're making a lot of people uncomfortable.  I can tell.  I'll leave if you want me to.  That's okay.  I understand.  What?  I understand.  You understand that?  Yeah.  We don't know if we want you back, though.  What?  Are we going to lie?  That would suck. 
[01:45:30]  Well, do you understand there has been a breach of faith here?  Don't you find it a little weird, the whole thing?  You're still wearing the patch, and you don't even have an eye injury.  You do have an injury, though.  That's what you don't understand.  But very injured.  You said you had an injury on your forehead.  There's not even a scratch.  My head was smashed apart, and I lost my shoes.  So, uh...  You're about 19 feet away.  Okay.  Yeah, move back and forth.  Thank you.  God damn it.  You're awful.  So mean.  I'm mean.  The guy's...  Shut up! 
[01:46:00]  No, I see where you're coming.  Shut up, Jess.  I don't pound it, Jess.  Opie, you're 100% right.  Look, what?  Stank, am I right?  You are.  Ben, am I right?  100%.  Thank you.  200%.  You're not going to ask me?  I don't care.  I know you don't care.  That's all right.  These are good cookies.  Who wants them to come back?  Not everyone at once.  Wow.  That hurts.  How's it going to be different any day? 
[01:46:30]  You know, tomorrow.  Awkward.  It's going to be different.  Yeah, you're calling...  Is the injury going to be healed?  You're calling sick half the time anyway.  Is this going to crush you?  Uh, not that much, but it will.  A little bit, because I like you guys.  Aw.  I mean, I tried my artist while I was here.  Ugh.  I mean, this is...  Be tough, be tough.  I'm talking to myself.  Um...  Would we have to worry about you coming back here and shooting everybody?  I don't like being blunt with this thing. 
[01:47:00]  Now, is there anything that might happen?  You're going to shoot everyone?  No.  No, no.  No shooting going on.  Stab?  No.  You can still listen to us through the radio and stuff.  Let's see how things go.  Can you step back a little bit?  Hello.  I think, uh, he sounds fine to me.  I don't foresee any problems with him coming back.  So, Brian, why don't you, you know...  You're not going to kill anybody, though, right?  No, nobody's going to be...  All right.  No threats, no, uh...  No threatening emails or anything?  Nothing at all.  What?  Nothing at all. 
[01:47:30]  Nothing at all.  Brian, sign the message bill.  Did you sign something?  Yes.  When you started working here?  Yes.  Okay.  That you're not to kill anybody?  Yeah, I didn't read the fine print, but I guess...  I think that was in there.  Brian, I'd feel safer if you weren't around.  You know, it comes from this, uh, breach in faith.  We all trust each other here, and we don't lie to each other.  And then when a lie is made like that, we're like, hey, where does it end?  You know what I mean?  Okay.  Oh, I'm the guy.  You just made me the guy.  I just said that.  I've gotten that speech before.  Well, no, you be the guy. 
[01:48:00]  I'm going to go back to my cookies.  I don't care.  And beer.  Hang out.  Cookies and beer.  I'm fine.  We'll leave the door jar, and we'll revisit this.  You're not fired.  You're on what we call a permanent layoff.  Oh, I've been laid off.  All right, Rick, why don't you show Brian the door?  Oh.  What?  Jess?  I'm terrible.  No, you guys are right the more I think about it.  He's all right?  No, you guys are right the more I think about it.  Why?  What were you thinking before?  I just felt like it was, like, mean. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  But, I mean, I feel bad, but, I mean, that's kind of elaborate.  Yeah, but we don't.  No, you're right.  That's what I'm saying.  We don't work with him.  It's someone like Stink.  I can see it in his face.  He's not happy.  Ben's not happy.  You're not happy.  I'm not happy.  Rick's not happy.  Yeah, I see.  That's what I mean.  I see the point.  You don't have enough brain cells to figure out that the guy's a psychopath.  Right.  You're working with him thinking everything's fine. 
[01:49:00]  Brian, any final thoughts?  Oh.  Oh, God.  Yeah, you want to make a good statement?  It's been real.  Do you feel this is justified?  Somewhat.  If I brought in the police report, would you guys still think I'm BSing?  Oh.  Well, I have a problem with the stitches that weren't there.  Yeah, even if you are in some kind of an accident, like, the stitches not being there is a little weird.  Okay.  Not only that, if you really had an accident, then fine.  Call us and say you had an accident. 
[01:49:30]  But don't not call us or call other people in this building and then show up the next day that you're supposed to be here to work with an eye patch, a captain's hook hand, a freaking bandage on your head.  A parrot.  I'm surprised you didn't wipe off your own leg just so you can limp in here, for Christ's sakes.  All right.  Well, we've got to take a break, Brian, so thank you.  Well, you know something.  What?  Send him home today.  And then let's really discuss this because, you know, you know what it is.  Come on.  Have a little, you know, compassion.  I have compassion. 
[01:50:00]  I just, I feel bad somewhere inside.  How old a guy are you?  20.  He's 20.  You didn't F up, tell a few wacky stories when you were 20.  But I F'd up so many times, and Rick's been a lot cooler than that.  You didn't come in with a fake injury.  That's what I mean.  I'm on your side.  I'm saying.  A fake injury is weird.  Rick's easy to go to when you screw up.  Single white female territory.  It's weird if I could figure out why you did it.  I really still don't understand why you would do it.  Is there some kind of an issue you got?  Are there other issues? 
[01:50:30]  It's hard to scream across the studio, but it's a matter of being really afraid of you guys and being intimidated.  You're 19 feet away.  Is it an attention thing?  No.  You don't crave attention?  No.  Maybe?  No?  Dude, you look ridiculous.  You're standing there with an eye patch that you probably don't need.  Oh, probably.  He's warming up to you.  All right.  We've got to move on with the show.  Okay.  So, look.  You go home for the rest of the day because he can't think under these circumstances. 
[01:51:00]  And then we'll get back to you on the long term of this.  Sure.  I just want to see it.  All right.  That's all.  And it's just letting you off the hook lightly.  No, I'm not.  I'm really interested to see if I'm out.  You'll get the phone call tomorrow.  Oh, man.  Look at the axe.  Oh.  I'm kind of expecting it to you.  I don't care.  I want to see it.  But that's all.  All right, Rick.  Thank you, Brian.  Thank you, Brian.  For your service to this fine radio show.  Let's take a break, regroup, and do something different.  You've got all the tact of a rake. 
[01:51:30]  We're still stupid.  Well, if that's what it takes to get good ratings, we'll continue being stupid.  We don't care.  We don't care.  And I've been expecting you to make exactly that asinine statement.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Theater of the Mindless.  Man, if the president was in Vietnam.  I know.  I saw that on the news.  He's taken this little trip to Vietnam.  And I guess it's some kind of goodwill trip that he's taken. 
[01:52:00]  This, he's just wasting time, you know.  It's so obvious that this guy is, he's out, you know, regardless of who they put in there  now.  But that whole debacle looks like it's going to be Bush as early as tomorrow.  Well, we'll see.  Watch.  Watch what happens.  It'll go on and on forever.  But Clinton now, he would never have done something like this to this extent.  Because, um, he's, he's, you should get bashed for this.  The guy is, uh, is a disgrace.  And the veterans that served in Vietnam ought to, well, they already can't stand him. 
[01:52:30]  But they really should be up in arms now.  Because, uh, what the hell business does he have going over there and shaking these people's  hands?  And smiling and laughing at them.  And I was thinking about this.  It's as if, uh, you get a bunch of your friends together, right?  And they're going to fight, uh, with this, uh, bunch of other guys.  And then one of your group of friends runs away from the fight.  And your friends, uh, get their asses kicked.  Then a little while later, you go over to the guys that, that, that beat up your friends  and start shaking hands and smiling, taking pictures. 
[01:53:00]  Then your friends look like, they turn around and go, what?  You effing tall.  Does this have something to do with Clinton being a draft dodger?  Hey.  Oh.  You're quick now today.  Look at that.  The big yellow ones.  The sun.  I had a firm and I was going to school.  But now, 30, 30 years later, he steps off Air Force One, uh, and, and now he's in the  NOM.  This, ooh, scary.  Wow, look at this.  Ooh, look.  A place selling McDonald's and Coca-Cola. 
[01:53:30]  Petrifying.  Landing in a, oh my God, Air Force One.  It's a hot LV.  Hot LV.  Red smoke.  No, there's nothing going on.  Zips in the wire.  Zips in the wire.  No, no, you missed all the action, uh, Mr. Clinton.  What?  I got my little radio here.  I'm like the radio man.  Hot.  Zips in the wire.  Hold that perimeter.  Snake and nape on my paws.  No, no.  None of that's going on anymore.  Goddamn slopes.  No.  Play the music when we come into, uh, the airport. 
[01:54:00]  No, Air Force One.  Play the music.  Drives the slopes crazy.  See that one running?  Go ahead.  Put the pontoon right up our ass.  Yeah.  I'm going to smoke me some weed.  Hey, this is great.  You ever do a shotgun?  I swear, this is great.  Look, we're here in our, uh, our bunker.  Let me just crack the, uh, crack the shotgun for you.  There we go.  Look, now I'm going to blow the smoke in through the, through the magazine. 
[01:54:30]  And you, you just, you just smoke it out of the barrel.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Feeling good.  Hey, this ain't your show, Elias.  This ain't your show.  Look, I'm firing out the door of Air Force One. 
[01:55:00]  Down on the last paddy.  This is fun because no one shoots back.  I'm busted.  Mr. President, how can you shoot innocent women and children?  It's easy.  You just don't lead them as much.  Goddamn, this is a blast with no one shooting back.  Look at that goop. 
[01:55:30]  I even shoot the water buffaloes.  I don't care.  Whatever it takes.  Leave that goddamn door open.  This is so much fun when I know they can shoot back.  Hey.  Hey.  That's right.  Psycho Mark's right here with me.  Where's that little, that little napalm slope girl running down the street?  I'll take her out.  You're a little too late, huh?  What?  Mr. President.  What happened? 
[01:56:00]  Where'd everyone go?  I love the smell of napalm in the morning.  Now, the war's over, you idiot.  Smells like victory.  Oh, wait a minute.  My serge wants to talk to me.  Your days of finger banging, old Mary Jane Brottencourt, through her pretty pink panties, are over.  No, no, no.  Don't tell me that.  I'm the president.  Hey, look who it is.  Dylan. 
[01:56:30]  Goddamn.  Come on.  Everyone goes home.  No one left behind.  No one left behind.  Where's this Charlie I heard about so much?  I love it.  Open up that front door.  Let's go, boys.  Yee-hoo.  God, I love this.  Shut up, you dink.  Ten dollars.  Love you, long time.  Come here. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  I thought that gook had a grenade.  But it was just a Big Mac and a piece over it.  But, hell, these things happen in wartime.  Unbelievable.  Go on enough.  No more yanking my cranky.  I love this.  I love this.  Knee deep in the rice paddies.  Oh, wait.  What's she going for?  Oh, it was just a piece of rice. 
[01:57:30]  Sorry.  Come on.  Let's do the whole village.  Let's do the whole village.  Holy ass.  You ever see a head come apart like that?  You're a rich man, Patrick.  30 years late.  I'm in combat.  This is great.  Why did I miss this?  This is so easy.  I don't know what I was so scared of when they told me to report. 
[01:58:00]  And I ran off to England because this is just a piece of cake.  You take your big jet planes.  You fly low.  Look at this.  There's another five.  I just walked right out.  Okay.  Groovy.  Why would he pick Vietnam?  He's got two months to waste.  And he goes over there.  I'm going to call in an airstrike.  Come on, folks.  Come on.  Oh, look at that.  It's beautiful, man.  It's infinitiful, man. 
[01:58:30]  Unbelievable.  And it's in the line.  Get the claymores.  Nothing's going on anymore, you idiot.  Goddamn surrounded by gook arms and legs.  Fly over the Hanoi Hilton.  Come on.  Here we go.  Everyone goes home.  Everyone goes home.  Oh, boy.  Come on. 
[01:59:00]  All right.  We got to take a break.  Jesus, man.  Clinton in Vietnam.  Vietnam.  Opie.  Oh, God damn it.  No.  No.  Son of a bitch. 
[01:59:30]  No.  Oh, God damn it.  No.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Opie and Anthony.  I'm a mental case.  Yeah.  And it is the O&A show.  Is this the greatest pregame show ever, Anthony?  Mets pregame show?  Yeah, I think it is.  I'd like to see Mike and the Mad Dog do any better.  All right.  Game on. 
[02:00:00]  Mike, we got the gay guy in the studio.  He's ready to perform.  I don't know.  Marco's been crying the whole time his commercials have been on.  He's been whimpering.  Whimpering like a girl.  Well, like Marco.  Actually, in the corner.  Anthony, we got to talk to Mike real fast.  He's the guy that's giving us the trip to Cancun for two people.  Mike, what's going on?  You guys are effing hilarious.  Screw that.  We want to thank you from the bottom of our hearts.  No problem, guys.  I wanted to make sure this happened.  I mean, I was having such a bad week, and you guys just made it for me. 
[02:00:30]  You're like the givers of new life.  Oh, nice.  The givers of new life.  So it's guaranteed.  You're giving away a trip for two to Cancun to Wendy because she's having this done on her.  Right.  And it's courtesy of EstudentTravel.com.  EstudentTravel.com.  Wonderful.  The number one student travel service in America.  That's right.  We're going to give you guys a ton of plugs this week.  I'll tell you what.  You guys keep it up, and we'll keep this thing going.  Nicey-nice.  Nicey-nice.  All right.  Well, thank you, Mike.  No problem, guys.  All right.  Check out EstudentTravel.com for your traveling needs. 
[02:01:00]  Yes.  All right.  It's time to do this.  Yeah, here we go.  I mean, it's time.  All right.  You guys have all been briefed.  You've gotten suggestions and techniques from the ladies here.  And, oh, yeah.  We have a pro in the studio, of course.  We have Cassidy.  Cassidy's been giving...  National theater.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Wait, we had to jump out of that.  She goes professional, you know, and then the P word eater. 
[02:01:30]  Peech eater.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Peach.  Peach eater.  She's a professional peach eater.  She's done it before.  So, Cassidy, you could yell out stuff to Marco as he's doing this.  As long as it isn't, you know, lick that pee.  Eat that pee.  Get your nose in that pee.  Right.  You know, things that aren't that technical.  Okay.  Would be nice.  We'll get this down.  Now, Wendy, you ready?  I'm ready.  You've been huffing and puffing over there.  A little nervous.  That's okay. 
[02:02:00]  Let me get the mic over there.  He is red.  Get one last thing.  So, you're all ready for this?  I'm ready.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't worry.  Hey, Ed.  He won't bite.  Yeah.  Could she do this topless?  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes.  That's how you'll be in Cancun, right?  Yeah.  You're going to sunbathe topless.  Oh, good God.  Marco, look at that.  Marco, look at her.  Isn't that beautiful?  Oh, yeah.  Well, you heard it there. 
[02:02:30]  Now, describe what Marco is wearing, Anthony.  Marco has his lovely NSYNC T-shirt on with all the boys' faces emblazoned across the front.  He's got a bib on that says, I love Daddy, just in case any of that peach drips on him.  He doesn't want to ruin that NSYNC shirt.  And then he's got a bag full of hygiene products, oral hygiene and breath mints and gum and toothpaste.  Some kind of mouthwash.  Altoids and Wrigley's and Tic Tacs. 
[02:03:00]  Well, I'm sure with some of the places your face is gone, you carry that around a lot, right?  No, well, I'm just thinking, you know, my overnight bag.  That's his overnight bag, sure.  You know, come on.  What's the clothespin for?  He brought a clothespin.  Now, that's a little insensitive, Marco.  And now that I've met lovely, what was your name?  This is very typical for me, you know.  Ah, not knowing the name.  Wendy, Wendy.  I knew that, Wendy.  Lovely Wendy. 
[02:03:30]  And now that I've met her, I know that she is going to be fresh smelling.  So I won't be needing any.  Oof.  I won't be needing.  You really don't know, girls.  I know.  Let me tell.  You know something?  Let me say something.  Yeah, let me explain why I said that.  This is just a fallacy because there's a few, let's just say, bad peaches that ruin it for everybody.  She seems very hygienic.  Well, no, the problem I was trying to get at was the whole friend thing. 
[02:04:00]  That's right.  Our friend.  But you know something?  There are various feminine hygiene products during that time of month that keep things fresh.  Wendy, I apologize.  Oh, that's fine.  All right, good.  All right, she's okay with it.  If you ruin this, I'm going to punch you in the face.  Okay, we ready?  Yes.  All right, Wendy, if you would assume the position, as they say.  Oh, my God.  Wow, what is she wearing?  She's got, well, you've got to give them enough room, like to the knees or something. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, my God.  Yeah, to the knees.  We're all friends and family here.  She's got a pair of hot black panties.  Don't worry.  You know something?  Take a breath.  Shut your eyes and let your inhibitions just melt away.  Would you like a blindfold?  Melt away.  Yeah.  A blindfold.  Because Marco's got to be able to get, I'll tell you something.  Oh, my God.  Let me tell you something.  The knees apart thing is very difficult for a guy.  All right.  Because that really strains the neck.  Well, what do you want me to do?  Well, you've got to be able to, yeah, you've got to be able to. 
[02:05:00]  That's good?  To really.  Yeah, because he could get in there.  Oh, okay.  You could pop your head through.  Oh, my God.  Marco, you okay?  Bend over me.  Bend over me.  How about you?  No, but that doesn't work like that.  Put your legs in the air.  He can't get to the goods.  Come here.  Oh, look at Marco.  Wait, wait.  Oh, my God.  Okay, get the song ready.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  They're holding hands.  He is now kneeling down right in front of her.  She is sitting on the famous couch, and he's crying.  Marco? 
[02:05:30]  Marco's crying.  Marco.  How much do you want to sing?  Do it for JC.  Oh, God.  JC.  It's JC.  You might need him.  I know, I know.  Think of JC.  JC.  Now, wait a minute.  He can't get to that way.  He's got to go from that way.  Yeah, there you go.  That's perfect.  You don't understand.  I understand.  You know what?  No, no.  Look, look.  We all understand.  Look, you know what you could do?  Stay like that until everything's ready to happen.  And then let it ride, and he will do what he's got to do. 
[02:06:00]  Okay?  Promise?  Yeah.  Don't worry.  We will.  He will be coached.  He will be coached by the lovely Cassidy.  Now, Opie, the song's got to start, and then Marco will go to work.  Marco, are you shaking, Marco?  How are you doing, Marco?  Um, just keeping it down right now.  You're okay, Marco.  He's going to have a heart attack.  No, Marco, you're okay.  I don't know if he can do it.  It's not that bad, Marco. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, not that bad.  Okay.  I just think I'm in another place right now.  Right, another place.  Yeah.  You're okay.  He's sweating.  He's sweating like crazy.  Okay.  He will not look at her.  All right, if we can get the music started, maybe, and we will go.  We have a go.  All right.  Ready?  Three.  Let's light this candle.  What, what, what, what?  What do I do first?  Okay.  All right, Marco.  Calm down.  It's okay.  It's okay.  What you do first, Marco.  Right when the song starts, and the beautiful gates of pleasure open up, you take the area 
[02:07:00]  right here, and you go sort of right, right below the, yeah, yeah, she will point right  to it.  Get my eyes open, though.  Okay.  I'll show you real fast, and then you can close my eyes.  Okay.  Okay.  Ready?  All right.  Okay, go.  Can I look at it first?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Give him a quick look.  Oh, my God. 
[02:07:30]  No, Marco.  Get out.  Don't leave.  Marco, get out.  Marco, get out.  Come back.  Marco, come here.  Come here.  Marco, get out.  He feels like, no, Marco, come here.  Come here.  What was that?  Oh, Marco.  Marco, it's a woman.  Marco, it's a woman.  Marco.  I swear, it was like a scene out of Alien.  He freaked out.  And for the people playing at home, we just saw the hottest.  Right, right.  If you're a heterosexual guy, you would have just went like, oh, my God. 
[02:08:00]  Good God.  Oh, my God.  Marco.  Marco.  Marco, take a breath.  Now, let's get back into position.  I'll hold your hand if you want.  Oh, she'll hold your hand.  I'll hold your hand.  As long as I know Opie's behind me.  Oh, boy.  Opie, just say yes, yes, yes, and shut up.  Okay, hold on, hold on.  All right, he is back, kneeling.  He was not looking, though.  Now, right when the music starts, she will again, the gates will open, and you will... 
[02:08:30]  Wait, make him look at it again.  Oh, God, that ruins it, dude.  That's so funny, though.  Come on.  Mic him and make him look at it.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Open.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Why does it stick out like this?  That's a woman.  Marco's crying.  He's crying.  Marco, it's okay.  You're making me feel bad. 
[02:09:00]  There's no crying.  It'll make her feel bad.  I'm sure it's beautiful, but...  It is beautiful.  It could have been over with already.  What are you waiting for?  Right, see?  Okay, Opie, no more showing.  In sync.  J.C., just think J.C.  J.C.  J.C.  Yes.  J.C.  J.C.  J.C.  J.C.  Suck it up.  That's J.C.  J.C.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  You okay?  Hold on.  We've got to make sure everyone's okay before we start the song.  You just got to last...  I'm fine.  I'm ready.  You got to last three minutes and 20 seconds, Marco. 
[02:09:30]  Can I just give you...  I'll give you a pointer real quick.  All right.  If you want, go stick a Tic Tac in your mouth right now and eat it while you're...  While you're doing.  There you go.  Okay.  All right.  That's a very good suggestion.  Good, good, good.  I have a better piece of gum.  Good.  Altoid.  There's an Altoid.  He's shaking like...  Oh, my God.  Like a car on bed, Jess.  Is that okay, Marco?  Okay.  Yes.  He's got a mug.  He's got his I Love Daddy Biv on.  He is all set to go.  His NSYNC shirt.  He is kneeling before a beautiful girl. 
[02:10:00]  Gorgeous.  And he is now ready when the NSYNC song starts to consume the peach, as they say.  Mm-hmm.  You ready, Marco?  Stay up top.  Okay.  She will, again, point where you're supposed to go.  And let me make this clear, Marco.  Now, you know I'm your pal.  But...  If that song starts and too much time goes by before you start, we're going to stop the  song and start over again.  All right.  All right?  Ready?  Okay.  Ready?  Are we ready? 
[02:10:30]  Here we go.  Marco, take it away.  Win your NSYNC tickets.  Right there, baby.  Where's the music?  It's going.  I'm fucking here.  Stop.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, Mark.  ESD is the music.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  The first try is...  The headphones...  Marco's headphones don't reach.  All right.  Get the headphones on.  You got to get them to reach.  Get the...  You want mine?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  His legs are shaking.  Marco, Marco, take those headphones. 
[02:11:00]  You'll hear your beautiful NSYNC.  All right.  You can win.  Okay.  You okay?  All right.  All right.  It's all NSYNC now.  That's all you're going to hear is your JC.  JC.  JC.  And talk to Wendy for a second.  Wendy, how are you doing?  There was contact.  I'm getting nervous.  He's making me nervous.  It's not about you, baby.  It's about him.  Now, Opie, no, something didn't happen like that.  Oh, no?  It didn't.  There was never contact.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  I've never actually seen such struggle with a girl pulling a guy's head.  I see it the other way around sometimes, but you never... 
[02:11:30]  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  The song is going to start, Marco.  You've got to loosen up.  She's pulling on your head like, I don't know what.  Any guy would be dying right now, Marco.  Look at this t***.  Marco, you're so gay.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Marco.  You're so gay.  Thank you.  Yes, Marco.  All right.  Is the song ready again?  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  Here we go.  Take two.  Let it rip.  And we have contact. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, my God.  He's doing it.  All right.  Wait.  Mike Wendy, because she's making some bizarre faces.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Wendy, what's going on?  Oh, my God.  This is so weird.  Is it working?  No, it's not working.  No, no.  Keep going, Marco.  All right.  Let's see.  Side to side.  Side to side. 
[02:12:30]  She's like, she's got her head going back and forth like, no, no, this is awful.  Look at her.  Talk to Wendy.  Talk to Wendy.  Wendy, how you doing?  He's doing a wonderful job.  No, no.  She goes, no, no.  And two and a half minutes to go.  No audio coming from the area.  Two and a half minutes to go.  Wait, Wendy.  Is he still doing it?  He's doing it.  Yeah, Marco.  Don't just keep your head down there.  You've got to work it.  Don't just stare at it. 
[02:13:00]  There he goes.  Wendy, why are you, like, freaking out so much?  What is he doing in particular that's so freaky?  It's so gay.  He what?  What is it?  It's so...  I asked him what the problem is.  He goes, it's so gay.  Keep going, Marco.  You're almost there.  Two minutes.  Two minutes to go.  He's coughing.  He's coughing.  Tell us what he's doing wrong.  He's coughing or crying or something down there.  Marco, almost there.  Keep going.  Keep going.  You can do it.  You can do it.  What's he doing wrong? 
[02:13:30]  Puffing on him.  He's coughing and coughing on him and he's coughing.  Keep going, Marco.  You're almost there.  It's almost done.  His legs are flailing.  It's as if someone was chomping his head off.  You okay?  What is the difference between good and what he's doing?  Good actually makes me smile, like, for real.  This is freaking you out.  Maybe if you grab the back of his head, he'll do a little better. 
[02:14:00]  And he shakes his head.  No!  I've got to see if he's doing this right.  You get your head in there, my friend.  I sit there.  All right.  You tell us if he stops.  How much longer?  How much longer?  We're at the one minute warning.  One minute, Marco.  One minute, Marco.  You're all man.  You're all man.  You're all man.  Look at this gay guy go.  He's doing push-ups or something.  Is he getting better as time goes on?  No, he's getting worse.  He's getting worse?  Marco, say something.  Marco, how are you doing? 
[02:14:30]  No, keep going.  You're almost there.  Say something.  Don't lose contact or we start over.  Say something.  Hum.  Hum or do something.  All right.  You seem to have settled down.  Listen to him breathe.  30 seconds, Marco.  30 seconds.  The song's almost over.  JC!  Think JC!  Marco, JC!  Is this the worst you've ever had? 
[02:15:00]  I can't even explain this right now.  Five, four, three, two, one.  Marco, you did it!  Marco, you did it!  Marco, you did it!  Marco, how does it feel?  Marco, how does it feel?  I'm going to the sink.  Look at him crying on the floor.  He's crying on the floor with a little bit on it.  It's in the sink shirt.  He's in the fetal position.  Marco, you did it.  Marco.  Wait, was that the worst ever? 
[02:15:30]  That was so bad.  It was so bad.  All right, they're putting Altoids in his mouth, really.  I can't even describe it.  Very bad.  Marco?  Not a hint of pleasure.  No.  Marco.  Marco.  Is he coming to you yet?  Marco?  Marco?  He's still on the floor.  He's breathing heavy.  It's over.  You're getting good.  Very good, Marco.  Marco?  And then right when he came away, he took his I love daddy bib and just wiped his face with  it, crying.  You all right there, Marco?  Yeah.  Let's not forget that Wendy had her friend. 
[02:16:00]  Yes.  Yes.  Marco?  Yeah.  He's crying.  Marco.  Why are you crying?  Are you okay?  I'm okay.  Wait, he's really crying.  You all right?  I'm fine.  You all right?  Yep.  How was it for you?  Wait, are you crying because of what you just did or because you just won the NSYNC ticket?  Both.  Oh, my God.  It's okay, Marco.  Guys would have loved doing what you were just doing there. 
[02:16:30]  It was awful.  Oh, my God.  What was the most horrible thing about it, Marco?  The taste.  Oh, no.  Now, Wendy, don't let this be a reflection on you.  He is a gay man.  You know, he likes things like man A.  You know, so we really got to keep things in perspective here.  It just tasted so weird.  So weird?  Yes.  From a guy that likes man A.  Look at him.  Well, Marco, let me present to you two tickets to NSYNC No Stings Attached Door at the Continental Arena. 
[02:17:00]  Congratulations.  I hope that makes it a little easier for you.  Yes.  Yes, it does.  Thank you so much.  Hopefully, that's the funniest kind of thing you've ever seen.  It was the best thing we've ever seen.  Oh, my God.  He's sweating.  He's beat red.  He's tearing.  Horrified.  Are you all right, Marco?  I'm going to be fine.  Did you start getting into it at all?  No.  No?  It was just horrible.  And, Wendy, you were saying it was not pleasurable at all.  No.  Someone get Marco a banana. 
[02:17:30]  Now, for a guy, even a bad one is kind of good.  Sure.  Just because it's happening?  But that wasn't even happening?  It was just because it was really weird because he's so really gay.  The gayness came through in his...  If I didn't know he was gay, it probably wouldn't have been as bad.  Right.  But because he is, and I definitely take that into consideration why.  He's a trooper, though, because he did it the whole time.  He did.  He didn't come up for air once.  Not once.  I almost puked.  Well, that's good.  Again, Wendy, no reflection on you. 
[02:18:00]  You've got to remember where it's coming from.  Well, Marco's got the NSYNC tickets, and Wendy has a trip for two to Cancun, Mexico,  courtesy of EastStudentTravel.com.  Wow, congratulations to everybody.  Beautiful job.  The number one student travel service in America, EastStudentTravel.com.  Now, let's go to our house porn star.  Oh, adult film actress.  I'm sorry.  Cassidy, 19 years old.  Cassidy, you witnessed the whole thing.  How does that rate with some of the porn star actors that you've seen working the same area? 
[02:18:30]  That was pretty sad.  Oh, I love Wendy.  A little kiss on the cheek, and he is even more disgusted.  Unbelievable.  Marco, any final thoughts?  Yeah.  No.  Was that the worst thing you've ever, ever done in your life?  Yes.  Wow.  Was that the worst thing ever done to you, Wendy?  Yes, definitely.  No doubt about it.  All right.  Our mission is done here.  Okay, great.  Bravo.  Okay, terrific.  Thank you very much, all involved.  You're going in sync. 
[02:19:00]  There you go.  All right, why don't we take a break, and we'll be back.  212-757-1027.  We'll be back in just a bit.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Hey, we're getting a request for Buddy Epson singing. 
[02:19:30]  Ben, can we get the Buddy Epson singing thing real fast?  I don't fight it.  I don't fight it.  Hi, Anthony.  If I can.  Yeah.  The great Buddy Epson singing.  Come and listen to the story about a man named Jed, a poor mountaineer, barely kept his family fed. 
[02:20:00]  And then one day, oh, he never, when I, I'm still writing it, when people, I'm sorry.  Okay, terrific.  We got a lot of negative email on that one.  Use it or lose it. 
[02:20:30]  For the record, the publicist told us, or said that Buddy sings a very interesting version of the song.  Oh, I thought you were going to say the publicist called and was pissed.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  They encouraged us.  They said, hey, have Buddy sing.  He does a good version of the theme song.  Yeah, we thought he had some kind of a parody version, you know.  So we asked him, and that was what we got.  All right, let's go to the phones.  212-757-1027. 
[02:21:00]  Stan, what's going on?  Hey, I just wanted to let Anthony know today's Tom Brokaw's birthday.  Is it?  How old is Tom Brokaw?  I don't know.  I just know it's his birthday.  I figured I'd say happy birthday.  All right, thank you.  Maybe we could talk to him later.  I wonder how old he is today, eh?  I don't know.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  I'd like to thank everyone here at NBC Nightly News for throwing me this fabulous birthday bash on my 61st birthday. 
[02:21:30]  Tom, would you like a hit for your birthday?  I'm 61.  Sure.  Let me pass this over to you over here.  Let me get that.  There you go.  Wow, that's some good crap. 
[02:22:00]  Unbelievable.  I plan on going out to a couple of raves tonight and take some ends.  I'm going to hook up with some ladies and get my F on and bust three nuts.  Because that's the kind of guy I am.  Who wants to be Tom's B.I.?  I'm going to go out with J-Lo and shoot up some places. 
[02:22:30]  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  Last night, Tom Brokaw shooting up a bar with his new girlfriend, J-Lo.  J-Lo.  J-Lo.  J-Lo.  J-Lo.  I love that booty.  Your voice is effed up today, right?  That's a great ask.  Well, if I wasn't doing the QVC Shop at Home card guy, perhaps my voice wouldn't be so effed up.  Don't forget Dudley Moore.  Wonderful. 
[02:23:00]  And everyone else.  Mr. Brokaw.  Yes.  It's entertaining today.  Busy little day for Tom Brokaw here on NBC Nightly News.  Yeah.  Hey, look.  I see Ronald Reagan's on the phone.  Oh, really?  I wonder what he's going to sound like today.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  Ronald Reagan's birthday.  Damn, I can't say that right.  Ronald Reagan's 90th birthday. 
[02:23:30]  Joey Big Arms from Fairlawn.  Prior to talking with Ronald Reagan, Anthony, make sure you go to the bathroom and Rick is handling the phone systems so there are no problems.  Then you can finally talk to one of your heroes.  That would be nice.  Wouldn't that be good?  Is he on the phone?  Well, let's pick him up.  Okay.  Pop him down.  All right.  Would you like to talk to the former president?  Yes.  Finally, Anthony?  Pop him down.  It's kind of strange. 
[02:24:00]  I'm always the one interviewing him.  I know.  You're nowhere to be seen.  All right.  Mr. President Ronald Reagan, how are you today?  Oh, hello?  Hello?  Hmm.  He's not there for some reason.  I hear noises in the background.  Maybe he fell again.  Or maybe they're waking him up so he can talk to us today.  I hope it's not a problem with the phone equipment.  Maybe I should go out and make sure that Jack is connected.  Oh, I think Rick could handle that, Anthony.  Can Rick handle that?  Yeah, I'm sure.  Right, Stinky?  Rick's working on the phone to make sure it's okay? 
[02:24:30]  He's playing with it.  I don't know.  I better check that out.  No, no, no.  We really want you to talk to Ronald Reagan today.  I would love to.  It's an honor.  Mr. President Ronald Reagan.  Yeah.  How are you on your 90th birthday?  I hear the phone.  I hear it, too.  But, see, he's there.  I don't think...  I think it's a problem with the phone line.  I better go and make sure that Jack is plugged in, because I know it.  I've seen this phone before.  A lot of problems with it.  No, no.  And I know how to fix it.  Why don't you just tell Rick to fix the phone? 
[02:25:00]  All right, let me go back and tell Rick to fix the phone.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, Anthony.  No.  I'll go back.  Why?  No, no, no, no.  Ben, Stinky, come here.  Maybe I should go and tell Rick.  I want to prove this once and for all.  It's like a Superman episode.  Could you get Ben in here?  I mean, Rick.  I'm sorry, Rick.  Yeah, Rick?  I'll get him.  No, no, no.  I want you to sit here for once.  What?  Hey, Rick?  Rick, how you doing?  Can you fix the phones? 
[02:25:30]  Anthony talks about...  What is it?  What is it?  What?  You have to plug something to Jack.  It's because of the computer system that we have hooked up with, and I know I look really  good with computers.  Yeah, see, I know I could do this.  No, no.  Perhaps I should do it.  Scott is gone?  No, no.  I think he might be my best bet to try and get this situation.  Why don't you fiddle with it a little bit?  I really want Anthony talking to...  Is that Ken out in the office?  No, no.  Oh, he's waving at me.  Wait.  One second.  No, I've got to talk to Ken Stevens.  I want you...  For a second, but I'll be back to talk to...  Ronald Reagan.  No, I want to talk...  I want you to talk to the former president for once. 
[02:26:00]  I will.  I'll be right back.  And there seems to be a problem by the time we fix it.  I'll be done with that, Ken Stevens.  I am sick of carrying your ass and doing all the interviews.  No, no.  I'll be right back.  No, wait, Anthony.  No.  I'll be right back.  No.  No.  Two seconds.  I'll be right back.  Ken.  Ken Stevens.  I see Ken out there.  All right, all right.  Well, come back in.  How much longer do I have to wait for this call?  Hello?  President Reagan.  Yes.  Could you hold on a minute?  I want you to talk to my buddy and my pal, my partner on the radio, Anthony. 
[02:26:30]  Yes, I know Anthony.  He's a very, very talented young man.  Even with my Alzheimer's, I can say...  No, he's not that talented.  That man is fabulous.  No, he sucks.  He's marvelous.  Well, listen, you know, it's my birthday today.  Yes, it is, sir.  Stinky, hold on.  Stinky, where's Anthony as I talk to the former president of the United States?  He's out there with Ken.  Where?  He's out there with his office.  I'll be like two seconds. 
[02:27:00]  See?  I'm right here with Ken.  What are you guys talking about?  Wait, the president is on the line.  I can't take this.  If I'm not...  I'm busy and, well, it's my birthday.  Sir, we wanted to wish you a very happy 90th birthday today, but I want Anthony to talk  to you.  You're one of his heroes.  Yes, I know.  Did I say how much I admire that man?  He's a fine American.  He's not that great.  Trust me.  And on this mind, well, 90th birthday, I'd like to say, God bless Anthony. 
[02:27:30]  Because he...  Oh, wait a minute.  Nancy's calling me to open a gift.  You bastard.  You bastard.  Could you hold on while I open a gift?  Sure.  Because it is my birthday.  All right.  I'll hold on a second.  Anthony, we're talking to the president.  Ken just had a little problem.  All right.  Well, he's on the line.  Talk to him.  I was talking.  Hello?  He's not here.  What do you mean?  I was just talking to him.  Where did he go?  I don't know. 
[02:28:00]  What?  Looks like you don't...  Mr. President.  It looks like you don't need that home gym anymore.  Mr. President?  Hello?  He said he was opening up a gift or something for his 90th birthday.  Oh, he is?  Yeah.  When he gets back on call me, I'm just going to finish up with Ken.  Ant!  What a swell gift.  No, I know it's you now, Anthony.  It's you.  It's a set of golf clubs.  No, Ant.  I am convinced...  You know, I play one hole of golf 18 times because they're all new to me. 
[02:28:30]  Ant, you've used that line every goddamn time you imitate Reagan.  I know it's you now.  I don't know what you're talking about.  I know it's you.  Don't you insult Anthony.  You bet.  That man is a true American hero.  No, no, you, Anthony.  Oh, hold on.  They're cutting the cake.  Oh, you son of a bitch.  It's my 90th birthday, and if I don't blow these candles out, the whole place is going  to go up.  Yeah.  So hold on.  All right.  Anthony, don't forget to add that line about how big your wife's head is. 
[02:29:00]  All right, Ken.  I'm doing a show.  Holy smoke, this guy.  Let me get it.  I'm doing a show, Ken.  Opie, I'm sorry.  Try to stretch it long enough.  Ant.  Ant.  What?  I know it's you.  Everyone knows it's you now.  You look silly.  What a dandy cake.  Ant, Ant, I just saw you.  You were right there.  I know the phone that you're talking on is like 20 feet away. 
[02:29:30]  Look, you young prankster.  Don't be saying things like this about my good friend, Anthony.  I'll send secret service over there.  Well, you won't be happy.  What are you going to do?  Oh, look, another present.  Let me, I'll open this one on your show.  Ant, if the listeners listen closely, they can hear you as Reagan out of breath because  everyone knows you're not in shape.  No, I just blew out the candles, and there were 90. 
[02:30:00]  Son of a bitch.  Hold it.  Oh, what a great gift.  It's a set of golf clubs.  I've always wanted these.  You know, I play one hole of golf 18 times.  I know.  It's all new to me.  Yeah, exactly.  See, that's Alzheimer's.  Anthony, they're all waiting for the lines about how big Nancy's head is.  Might as well get it out there.  I don't remember ever saying that.  Now we're going to go play Pin the Tail on the Democrat, one of my favorite games.  Yeah.  Could you please hold on? 
[02:30:30]  Of course.  Now Anthony's going to come back in the studio.  Opie?  Ed?  Yeah, hi.  How you doing?  Wait, you're not in the studio.  Where are you?  I'm sitting right in front of you, you jerk.  You're not in front of me.  No one's going to believe...  Hello?  Hi, it's me again, Ron Reagan.  You son of a bitch.  Hello?  Wait.  Mr. President, this is fabulous.  You son of a bitch.  Speaking to you is an honor. 
[02:31:00]  Well, Anthony, you've always been one of the greatest Americans on the face of this earth.  And I've got to tell you, I don't appreciate your friend Opie making some kind of a wacky gag out of the fact that you were me or...  Well, I don't even know what he was saying.  I'm incoherent myself sometimes, but that boy...  I know, Mr. President, it gets a little rough having to deal with him on a daily basis. 
[02:31:30]  I see you.  What?  You're talking to yourself.  What are you talking about?  You're talking to yourself.  You're in front...  I'm in the studio.  You're here.  You're talking to yourself.  Mr. President, I apologize for this.  It's an honor to speak to you.  Hello?  Yes.  That boy is very rude.  And I can't believe he would pull some kind of shenanigans like this on my 90th birthday. 
[02:32:00]  I just went in the studio and saw you talking to yourself.  What studio?  We're in the studio.  I'm sitting in front of you talking to Ronald Reagan.  What's wrong with that boy?  I don't know, Mr. President.  It's out of hand.  Well, you better fix him.  Because I'm not going to stay on the phone with him in the same room as you.  I know. 
[02:32:30]  In the same room as me, Mr. President.  Can I continue my birthday party now?  Yes, sir.  Yes, Mr. President.  Whatever you wish to do.  And finally, what an honor to talk to you.  And what an honor to speak to you, Anthony.  Godspeed and God bless.  Thank you, Mr. President.  And there he goes, Opie.  You bastard.  I hate you.  I was in the studio.  I saw you talking to yourself.  Now you're running back into the studio. 
[02:33:00]  Amen.  I've been talking about it.  You're stuck.  I've been sitting here the whole time.  You're such a bastard.  How does that sound?  You bastard.  You bastard.  What?  Sorry, I'm out of breath.  I was so nervous talking with the president.  That was exciting, Opie.  Finally.  Finally. 
[02:33:30]  I hear next Chris Jericho and Moongoose McQuaid are coming in.  I think that was our...  Who's on first bit?  Opie suffering from Dr. Bellows disease.  You bastard.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's up, ONA?  Hey.  Hey, Anthony.  I don't care how.  I don't care if it's really you or not.  Whatever.  But however you just pulled that off, that is one of the damn funniest things you guys  have ever done on this radio show. 
[02:34:00]  I don't care if it's you or not.  That was hilarious.  No, of course not.  Thank you, Matt.  Well, I guarantee you Rick helped him out on that.  I give up.  I give up.  I saw him talking to himself.  I can't prove that it wasn't.  This is radio.  I can't prove it.  But you were there by yourself, talking to yourself.  Yes.  No one's going to believe me now. 
[02:34:30]  What?  Please.  I was speaking from right here in front of you and you were trying some wacky bit.  I think you finally lost it.  Scott, what's up?  Oh, I'm so happy that you finally got to talk to the president.  I know.  Congratulations, man.  Thank you so much, Scott.  It must be an honor to talk to the president.  It was.  It just warmed my heart to hear how I know how sick he is now.  I hate you all.  Don't hate.  Don't hate.  The president. 
[02:35:00]  I left this studio.  I went down the hall where Anthony was doing his clever rules.  But I went to the hall and the genie was major...  But then I saw the...  You were there.  Major Nelson.  You were there.  Genie went...  But then I saw the...  And I heard...  Carolyn.  Hey, I was wondering if you guys could do that little skit on the XFL show.  So maybe if we see it, the acting would be better.  Thank you, Carolyn.  You're welcome.  Very funny.  All right.  All right. 
[02:35:30]  Well, let's take a break.  Oh, okay.  Whew.  This is pretty good.  I love obscure references.  Andrew from Jersey.  And come on, we all know Ken is still out on his lunch break.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back.  Hey, I'm Andrew.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Opie and Anthony.  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W. 
[02:36:00]  Look who's stopping by for a little visit today.  Oh, yeah.  Look at this.  Hickory dickory doo.  I ain't written a new joke since 82.  Oh!  Jeffrey Ross in studio.  How are you?  I'm great.  You have the worst luck, and I'll tell you why.  You always show up the day after, Ant and I do some just incredible, you know, blowout  show the night before, so we're just hungover, tired.  That's all you need, fresh blood.  Right.  Fresh attitude.  We're so vulnerable when you come in, because you always catch us when we're hungover. 
[02:36:30]  Ah, you don't look too bad.  We don't look bad?  He looks like crap.  Like 3.30, yeah.  I was up so late.  Why?  You went to the dice show?  Well, we hosted the dice show.  Ah.  He gave us some time up there, Jeffrey.  I was with Don Barris, one of his opening acts at 3 in the morning, getting wasted.  And Jim Norton, did he go on, too?  Oh, yeah.  Jim Norton killed.  Jim Norton killed.  Norton's very funny.  Funny guy.  I was at Game 5 of the World Series.  You were there?  Yeah.  Oh, I wasn't. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, it was really exciting, man.  It was really cool.  It's exciting if you're a Yankee fan.  You know what?  People hate hearing this, but I really love the Mets and the Yankees.  You're one of those guys.  I saw a playoff game at Yankee Stadium.  I rooted for the Yankees.  I was in Shea last night.  The Mets were down.  I rooted for the Mets.  What's wrong with that?  New York, New York.  They named it twice.  You've got to commit to a team.  It was all about committing to a team for the Subway Series.  I would get pissed when I walk down the street and you see a store that says, 
[02:37:30]  Go Yanks.  And then in the other window, Go Mets.  Come on.  Make the choice.  Oh, we've got to talk to Brewer.  Brewer owes me $1,000, by the way.  Yeah.  Is Brewer calling us today?  I don't know.  He was too drunk last night.  Yeah, Brewer called us really late.  He wasn't in his box seats.  That was weird.  It's shit.  No, he's in Montreal or something.  Oh, yeah.  I usually see him in his box seats.  He's got tickets.  Jeffrey, we get back to the station.  Like 1230 after the Dice Show, after watching the rest of the game, and we're just getting  our stuff to go our own ways and stuff.  My phone rings, and it's Brewer just hammered from Montreal talking about the Mets. 
[02:38:00]  And he promised he would call us today, but I don't know what's going on with that.  We've got to bump you for a minute.  No, you can actually help us.  We've got to talk to the robot from Lost in Space.  Oh, my God.  Can I get some calls?  Is it the actual robot?  I don't know.  No, it's the guy.  It's Bob May.  Bob May.  You're on, Bob.  Hello there.  How you doing, Bob?  Pretty good.  Who is this, Anthony?  Both of us are here, Anthony and Opie.  All right, Opie.  Yeah.  Now, you guys are coming over to see our show, I hope. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, get the plug in right away.  You're damn right.  I'm not going to fool around, you see, because my big friend is Big Kev.  Wait, wait, wait.  I mean, he's very good with all the stars in Hollywood.  Wait, I've just been informed you're not even the voice guy.  You're just the guy.  All right, now, wait.  Let me explain everything.  You're just the guy that was in the robot?  No, a guy.  Listen to this.  Wait a minute.  I'm the actor who was the one that created the part.  Yeah.  I did all the dialogue with Jonathan Harris.  And, in fact, there's some funny stories about Jonathan and I. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, dear.  I bet.  Yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, the pain.  Dear boy.  Now, Opie, I want to hear a good...  No, it's Anthony.  I want to hear an imitation of Jonathan.  He was just doing it.  Oh, that wasn't Jonathan.  Shut up, you bubble-headed boobie.  There's Jonathan.  Now, listen.  No, the way it worked very simply is our announcer...  You clattering clunk of colligionous junk.  Well, don't forget bubble-headed boobie, please.  Thought I just said that.  Oh, that...  Well, never fear.  Smith was there.  Now, wait a minute.  You did the trading, the little banter with Jonathan Harris. 
[02:39:30]  All that on the soundstage and weeks later in post-production, our announcer would loop  over the top of my lines.  Oh, so you're not even famous.  Well, you're not the guy.  You're nobody.  Hey, don't start with me, baby.  I'm from New York.  I did Broadway.  I wanted to hear the robot.  What happened?  Why can't we speak with the robot?  All right, listen, guys.  Yeah.  I'm in Australia with our announcer.  We're doing a public appearance. 
[02:40:00]  And we're on the radio station with this DJ.  And so Dick Tufelt, who was our announcer, and I drove the poor DJ nuts because I said,  Warning.  And he went, Warning.  And the guy says, Who the hell's doing this?  So we did the whole show that way.  Hello, that was a joke.  Oh, hey, guys, why don't you just save time and we just pass out some NyQuil around the 
[02:40:30]  studio?  Where'd you find this guy?  Hey, no, listen, you guys are big fans of Jonathan.  Oh, of course.  And rightfully so.  He's a great guy.  And what?  Did you ever see him touch young William?  Well, I saw him.  He was always grabbing him from behind.  Wow!  We were doing a scene one day where Jonathan had to polish the robot for a thing he lost  his bet.  Polish the robot.  So he was polishing the robot, and I said, Lower.  And he got lower. 
[02:41:00]  And I said, Lower.  He got even lower.  Finally, he dropped his hand lower, and I turned right around to him, and I said, I love  you.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Wait, wait, Bob.  I can't get past the fact that you're not the guy.  Yes, I am.  You were just the guy in the suit.  Don't start with me.  Were you actually in the suit?  Yeah.  Now, are you a man of short stature?  Yes, I am.  And how tall would you be? 
[02:41:30]  I am 5'6".  Okay.  And did you move it around in there?  Yeah.  I did everything with it.  In fact, Irwin Allen allowed Jonathan Harris and myself to create our own characterization.  What's your claim to fame?  I mean, you didn't even walk.  Oh, yes, I did.  Was it on a wheel thing?  No.  When it was in the full outfit, they pulled it with cables because the thing weighed 350  pounds.  They pulled it with cables?  And then sometimes I would carry the top section, which weighed 250 pounds.  I would carry that on a parachute-type harness. 
[02:42:00]  And just when we thought we were a big deal, we were at the garden in front of 11,000 people.  Yeah.  This shows how pathetic we still are.  We can't even get the guy that does the robot voice from Lost in Space.  Who's his agent?  Forrest Lawn?  How old is he?  Who's the agent?  William Morris.  That's Forrest Lawn.  That's for damn sure.  But the actual William Morris.  That's the guy.  So, hey, what have you done lately?  What have I done lately?  Well, since Lost in Space, I did several Jerry Lewis films, of course. 
[02:42:30]  Wow.  That'll get you a few laughs.  You're definitely Lost in Space.  Oh, I'm lost and you believe it.  What do you ask a guy that was just in a suit and didn't do the voice?  You ever fart in the costume?  No, but I'll tell you this.  Mark Goddard and Bill Moomey locked me in there for lunch.  Two things happened.  Number one, my wife knew where I was every moment.  And second of all, I had nothing else to do, so I lit up a cigarette and I was smoking  and Irwin Allen came on the set, saw smoke coming out of it, went for the fire extinguisher. 
[02:43:00]  And it didn't have to happen, of course.  But from then on, any time smoke had to come out of the robot, they handed me a cigar.  You want really uncomfortable radio?  Yeah.  Let's just not say anything anymore until he hangs up.  Check it out with Mark Goddard.  All right.  Wow.  What else could he tell us?  What else can I tell you?  Yeah, hey.  Well, I, as a robot, you know, I have a great memory because my computer banks will focus  on all different things.  So now I have a memory of you guys, and I expect to see your asses out here at the convention. 
[02:43:30]  If you're not out here, I'll send Dr. Smith to do what he's done to many of us.  Now, since you have such a busy schedule and dialogue is at a rarity, I must go because  I've got to get down to the fans. 
[02:44:00]  But I really appreciate being on your show, and I look forward to you coming out and being  on mine.  All right, guys.  And remember, if you want a star, get a hold of Big Ken.  Kev does it all.  All right.  Thanks.  Hey, guys.  It's Big Kev.  I have never felt more like a Met my entire life.  My God.  All right.  Say something. 
[02:44:30]  Ping pong balls.  Anything.  Whatever, Ben.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Oh, God. 
[02:45:00]  That is so uncomfortable.  Oh, I am friggin' sweating.  I'm cringing.  That is awful.  That's so uncomfortable.  Now, Big Kev's got to be like, oh, the show, you know.  Sometimes the zipper would get stuck.  Other times.  One time I put the right leg on backwards, and I had to start over again and put the left  leg on.  One time I was lost in Cleveland. 
[02:45:30]  One time I was lost in Trenton, New Jersey.  I had never been lost in space.  Not really.  However, there's actually two costumes.  Fascinating.  One I would make for public appearances.  Dude, we had to do that same interview with the guys that were in the Star Wars suits.  It was like, what do you ask them?  Yeah, when the movie came out, the last movie came out, Star Wars one, all the guys who are 
[02:46:00]  not in the most recent Star Wars movie were here.  Like, Boba Fett.  The guy that was in R2-D2.  The guy that played Darth Vader.  The Wookiee.  And the Darth Vader guy.  Right.  And we didn't know what to ask him, because all they were were the guys in the suits.  And it turned out he was only the Darth Vader one in the, like, third one.  Like, it wasn't even the first Darth Vader guy.  There was, like, the third one. 
[02:46:30]  Interesting enough.  Interesting enough.  The suits today are flame retarded.  One time I was smoking a cigar.  In between takes.  In between takes.  It was episode number 72.  Where we get lost in space.  And an ash fell on my leg.  Now, these suits today, they're flame retarded. 
[02:47:00]  But I lost a toe that day.  Irwin Allen came over to me and said, where's your toe?  The great Irwin Allen.  The great Irwin Allen.  It's not to be confused with Marty Allen, Steve Allen, Herb Allen, Paul Allen.  Burns and Allen.  Burns and Allen.  Allen.  Or Allen.  Then he has to go, well, I gotta go. 
[02:47:30]  I gotta go.  Wait, someone's pissed at us.  Come on, that was funny.  Kathy, what's up?  You guys are so mean.  Oh, my God.  This guy has the littlest claim to fame.  And you totally killed him.  We thought we were getting the voice, you know.  And do the voice.  We thought we had the guy.  Oh, my God.  Warning, warning, Will Robinson.  Get back to the Jupiter 2.  That poor little old guy.  Now, he's all upset.  And you guys are laughing. 
[02:48:00]  And then you try to make it up by saying, go see his show.  You guys are so mean.  Oh, my God.  Shut up, Kathy.  I would put one of my hooked hands in your ass.  Anyway, it was pretty funny, though, listening to Jed's face.  But at the same time, you guys are mean.  Love you.  See you.  All right, bye.  He was lost in space.  He was.  A lot of people saying that.  Hey, Dan, what's going on?  Dan.  Get Big Kevin back on the phone, by the way.  Dan.  Yeah, I want to see what the aftermath of that debacle was. 
[02:48:30]  Hello, Dan?  You gone?  All right.  Well, Bob made the guy that was in the robot suit.  Bill Big Kevin's going to have to kill a few more children and bury him in his basement  to make up for the aggravation of that call.  Yeah.  I'll call you, Opie, and you, Anthony.  And now I'm going to kill you and both.  All right.  Pete, what's up?  Hey, the actual robot would be funnier than that guy.  Well, possibly, yeah.  I resent that.  Anyway.  I think it's easy putting on that costume every day for 60 straight years. 
[02:49:00]  How many times can you tell people how much it weighed and how many pieces it was in?  When I see these actors like Jim Carrey in his Grinch costume, it's reminding me of the day that  Erwin Allen and I were lost on the Jersey Turnpike going to this Focardic convention.  I go.  And one more guy calls me Mr. Spock.  And I go, I go, but you don't, you didn't even walk in the costume. 
[02:49:30]  Well, we had a bully system.  No, he was in it.  Cables would drag him around.  And he's just standing inside this thing.  So it's not even like body mannerisms.  What about the arms?  They used to wave around.  When he would go, warning, warning, warning.  And then he would talk like, warning, warning.  Hey, Smith, wax me.  And then they'd have the guy overlay, hey, Dr. Smith, please shine my armor. 
[02:50:00]  But he'd be, ah.  Classic.  I had 15 minutes of fame.  Unfortunately, my face was covered.  Why would you put yourself in that position?  People are going to show up and go, wow, do the voice.  Well, I don't do the voice.  I don't do the voice.  I was just in the, in the suit.  You know every single person, every single person that goes there that wants to see the 
[02:50:30]  robot is going to ask them to do the voice.  And then, oh, I didn't do the voice.  But the costume weighs 500 pounds and it was pulled by a cable system.  One time I was smoking.  They didn't, they didn't even trust me to walk.  If they had to pull me with a cable, they'd pull me with pulleys and a cable.  These kids today, Alf and Chewbacca, they don't know what it was like.  Actors strike my ass.  Byron Allen, Debbie Allen, Allen from Scooby-Doo and I. 
[02:51:00]  Wow.  Damn, that was so uncomfortable.  Yeah.  Hey, Jeffrey Ross in studio.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back.  Give us a call.  212-757-1027.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, what would carbon sound like smoking pot?  You guys, I am so relaxed right now. 
[02:51:30]  Can I get a cookie, please, ma'am?  Ma'am, can I get a cookie?  I want a scooter.  Ma'am, can I get some pancakes and some porridge?  Oh, sweet.  Everything looks so carnival.  Look, you guys.  Castery compositives. 
[02:52:00]  I'm so high right now.  I feel like I'm floating. </pre>
