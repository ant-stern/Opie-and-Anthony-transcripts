<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with Anthony describing a terrible commute caused by a fatal Long Island Expressway accident involving a tractor-trailer, resulting in ambulance personnel also being injured. His car's check engine light illuminated, prompting an OnStar diagnosis of transmission trouble. A caller later diagnosed the issue as stemming from Anthony's aggressive driving.  The hosts then discussed the gruesome details of a Greyhound bus incident where a large Asian man beheaded and partially cannibalized a passenger, recounted by a listener.

They segued into a prank involving a booger placed on a piano key intended for Randy Newman.  The show then announced upcoming guests: Lee Tergesen and PJ Byrne from HBO's *Generation Kill*, and Danny McBride from *Tropic Thunder* and *Foot Fist Way*.  A substantial portion of the show focused on *Tropic Thunder*, with extensive discussion and clips, particularly concerning Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of a black soldier and the controversy surrounding Ben Stiller's "Simple Jack" character and the subsequent removal of the associated website.  The hosts debated a caller’s comparison of their prank to the booing of Mike Birbiglia, touching on the theme of bullying.  Other topics included complaints about crew member Tank Hankress (E-Rock), Godfrey's gym encounter with Shaquille O'Neal, and the hosts' dismissive reaction to *Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2*.  Lee Tergesen and PJ Byrne then joined the show, discussing the production of *Generation Kill*, its realism, and the audience's reaction to its controversial content.  They also shared anecdotes from their previous work on other HBO shows, and Byrne recounted preventing a rape.  Tergesen briefly shared his views on the Iraq War.

The show interjected a local news report about a beer-related murder, sparking humorous discussion about the repeated use of the word "beer" by a witness. A caller, Trixie, attempted a "Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday" segment, instead announcing she would serve her husband divorce papers while he slept, resulting in a loud, profanity-laced, and likely staged argument on air.  Danny McBride then arrived, and the discussion shifted back to *Tropic Thunder*, praising its humor and controversial aspects, particularly Tom Cruise's performance and the outrageousness of his character.  Patrice O'Neal joined remotely, adding his opinion, focusing on the film's depiction of a Jewish character.

The conversation continued with McBride, covering *Tropic Thunder* and *Pineapple Express*, with the hosts derisively reviewing *Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2*. Speculation about the sexual preferences of Barbra Streisand and others followed, along with the playing of behind-the-scenes audio of Laura Ingraham having a meltdown. The hosts engaged in offensive commentary about Bubba the Love Sponge, and detailed a listener contest for creating a wrestling character and promo for SummerSlam tickets.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to their feud with Bubba the Love Sponge, using highly insulting language to describe him and suggesting absurd challenges involving IQ tests and physical competitions.  Opie's brother Elmo's crude song insulting Bubba was played. Callers shared their opinions on Bubba, with one sharing a story involving a mastectomy, and another discussing Bubba's perceived hypocrisy.  Daniel Gardner, author of *The Science of Fear*, then joined the show, discussing media manipulation of fear through sensationalized reporting, using examples such as shark attacks, stranger abductions, and the aftermath of 9/11.

The final segment started with a caller discussing his daughter's fear of motorcycles after an accident.  The discussion moved to motorcycle safety, referencing the X Games and comparing motorcycle and car accident statistics.  The SummerSlam contest continued, with callers submitting bizarre and often offensive wrestling personas and promos, including one described as "full retard."  The chaotic judging process was highlighted, along with a surprise Shane McMahon appearance.  The show concluded with more contest entries, discussion of booking comedians, a host’s car troubles, the "line of the day" segment, and a repeat of the news report about the beer-related murder.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Too long to explain, but we gotta get Bobby Lee back in the studio to talk about that rabbit.  Good morning, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Anthony just arrived. He's not happy.  Ah, it's a smug guy out by the accident site? Yes.  I guess a lot of people aren't gonna be happy today. One dead, five injured.  An ambulance? Caused us? What happened? 
[00:00:30]  Nah, nah, apparently the five were injured in the ambulance.  One guy's dead because he decided to, you know, take on a tractor trailer.  And, of course, like we've talked about many times before,  the delicate ecosystem that is the Long Island Expressway was upset.  And, uh, you know, my normally 20-minute drive took me over an hour.  So, it's wonderful.  Uh, there it is. There's the tractor trailer.  And there's the car. Oopsie! 
[00:01:00]  Say hi to St. Peter.  Ugh.  God, it's just so goddamn annoying.  Wait, what happened, though? The guy went under the tractor trailer?  It was so impossible to tell because everything was just mangled.  Yeah.  The truck was spun around and jackknifed.  And then what? Other cars crashed into that?  Yeah. And, uh, apparently some, uh, ambulance workers got injured in some separate accident. 
[00:01:30]  So, they had completely shut down the Long Island Expressway,  which is the thoroughfare into New York City.  Well, the good news is it's the middle of the night, so it shouldn't affect too many people.  Ooh, yeah.  There's gonna be some pissed off people this morning.  It was backed up, uh, pretty much halfway from my house into work.  So, uh, I was just sitting in dead stop traffic.  And then an interesting thing happens.  My little, the little light that looks just like an engine pops up on my dashboard. 
[00:02:00]  And I'm like, ooh, that's not good.  Bing!  Yeah.  Just goes, dang.  So, I'm like, okay.  So, I hit my little OnStar button.  It goes, OnStar, how can we help you, Mr. Kumia?  I was like, uh, my check engine light just came on.  We will run a diagnostic.  So, they run the diagnostic.  And she goes, yes, we're showing a problem with your transmission.  It's, uh, in your drivetrain, not the engine.  And, uh, this has to be addressed, uh, immediately. 
[00:02:30]  But, uh, nothing opens till 8 o'clock.  Like, great.  So, I, I drove it in.  And the longer I was driving it, I hit the gas.  And the engine goes, and the, the vehicle doesn't get out of its own way.  It starts up, like, at this slow roll, like someone's pushing it.  And then very slowly can build up speed.  Uh, and then every light I had to stop at, same thing. 
[00:03:00]  Step on the gas.  People behind me are, like, beeping because I can't, it wasn't moving.  But, and if there's a, the slightest little hill, it's not getting up out of its own way.  So, the tranny is screwed.  Uh.  But you have a nice, uh, newer car.  Yes.  Your car is, what, only a couple years old at, at most.  Yeah.  Uh, I don't know what happened.  It was sitting in that traffic jam.  I don't know.  It's kind of creepy that a kid call a phone number and they kind of.  I know.  Diagon.  Yeah, yeah.  Diagonless your, uh, car. 
[00:03:30]  I like that feature.  Through a satellite.  That's creepy.  That's pretty cool.  You could actually, uh, go online and, uh, get that service online where it'll print  out a whole diagnostic on every piece of your car.  And you could tell if something's wrong with it.  It, it prints out the sheet.  Let's you know if everything's okay or whatever's wrong.  And you take it in and get it serviced.  How not fun would that be?  Yeah, no kidding.  To print something out and actually pour over that on the couch.  Just go, hmm.  Awful weekend.  Get a cup of tea and just kind of look at your, at the papers that. 
[00:04:00]  I need a new oil filter.  Yeah.  From the printer.  Tell your chick you get a great weekend plan and then she comes over with all this paperwork.  It's like my diagnostic report.  We're going to pour over it.  Yeah, with, uh, Sharpies and highlighters.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Two magnifying glasses.  Just bawling over it.  Yeah.  Just awful.  I'm going through my diagnostics.  Yeah.  Yeah, so that was, uh, that was my great morning getting in.  I got in and the show starts, which I got to tell you over the years is something I never 
[00:04:30]  like doing.  I like coming in, hanging out a little bit, talking, reading the papers, but you just run  in and we're on.  Try not to trip me up with those big feet of yours.  Yeah.  People don't understand that.  It's a, it's a very fine thing.  Like we need, we need to be in a, uh, routine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That routine is messed up.  Like they throw us in another studio or want us to broadcast from another city. 
[00:05:00]  They think, oh, it's just going to sound like it does every morning.  No, it just always messes it up.  No, you're getting that groove.  Yeah.  You got it like zone.  Yeah.  You got to go through your morning ritual before you come on.  Yeah.  6 a.m.  Okay.  Crappy bagel.  I can't eat now.  Yeah.  Start eating.  Who gives a crap?  It's still early.  Hey, we got more news on the giant Asian, uh, that beheaded that, uh, that passenger on  the Greyhound bus.  More news.  What could there possibly be?  This guy saw the guy's head off and started eating him on the bus. 
[00:05:30]  I want to thank Joey Gorgeous from East Hampton.  He writes, Joey Gorgeous.  More news on giant Asian police report, uh, officers found ear, nose, and part of a mouth  in the man's pocket.  It's on CNN.com.  Can we please get that story?  Wow.  Wow.  This guy is a complete kook.  And then in his court appearance, he's basically saying, uh, somebody please kill me.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That came out yesterday as well.  He, you know.  Why is he huge? 
[00:06:00]  How big is he?  Uh, well, Patrice said he was a big Asian guy.  Okay.  He's like over six feet.  Over six, uh, feet tall.  Yeah.  Wow.  What a ghoul.  Hey, someone is, uh, already diagnosing your car.  Oh, are they?  Paul in Bayside.  What's up, Paul?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, sir.  Hey, Anthony.  Your torque converter is locked in the, is stuck in a locked position.  Oh, yeah?  That's, that's why you have no power off the line.  It's an electrical problem.  Very minor and can be fixed very simply. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, really?  Yes.  You know, it really sucked.  I wasn't even able to put it in manual.  Like, I tried putting it in manual so I could just shift it up and down off the, uh, you  know, the little shifter.  Uh, and, uh, it wouldn't even go into manual.  Normally off the line, your torque converter is unlocked to give you more power to get you  going.  Mm-hmm.  When it's stuck in the locked position, it's one-to-one.  Therefore, no power.  You're struggling the engine.  And reverse, uh, works fine, by the way.  Yeah, it's a different module.  Mm-hmm.  It's totally different. 
[00:07:00]  All right.  You must beat the hell out of that truck.  Oh, why?  What does that mean?  Yeah.  I mean, if you do a lot of hard, uh, hard acceleration off the line, that will definitely  cause a problem.  Wow.  You know something?  You're absolutely right.  I do.  I'm kind of scared this guy knows all this from you talking about your car for a minute.  I, uh, I do.  I slam on the gas constantly.  Yeah.  I, that thing kicks into low gear so I can get in the left lane and get around, idiots.  You're absolutely right.  I beat the crap out of it. 
[00:07:30]  Well, there you go.  Booyah.  Booyah!  Booyah!  Booyah, gentlemen.  All right.  Did Randy Newman ever play his dumb piano yesterday?  He's not.  I think he's coming in today.  Yeah, there's some kind of thing.  I don't know what they're doing today over there.  Why are you running over there?  It's frightening to see.  What is E-Rock doing?  I wanted to show you who was the first to play the piano after we left the studio.  Oh, really?  Yeah, somebody decided to sit down and, uh, tickle the Ivories.  Yes.  For the people that don't know, we, uh, discovered that, uh, Randy Newman was coming in to play, 
[00:08:00]  uh, this, this, uh, this grand piano for Ron and Fez yesterday.  And we decided to, uh, put a booger on one of the keys.  And then, uh...  And then followed by...  Look at the picture.  Dude, this is effing radio.  E-Rock, will you explain what's going on?  Come on, E-Rock.  He's just walking around showing pictures.  Master Poe is tickling the Ivory.  Oh, Master Poe?  Well, he's got a booger on it.  He is the dumbest guy, I'm telling you.  And then he goes, you're just saying that for the radio. 
[00:08:30]  And then I have to tell Master Poe, yeah, just for the radio.  It's fun to tell everyone that you're dumb.  And once again, I'm calling him dumb.  And later on today, he'll go, that was for the radio, right?  Yes, Poe, it's for the radio.  He is as dumb as they come, man.  He really is stupid.  So we put a booger on one of the keys yesterday.  Yeah.  Hoping that Randy Newman was going to play the piano.  Yeah, and it was going to...  And then he tricked us, because I guess Randy Newman's playing the piano today, 
[00:09:00]  so now we have to work up some more boogers.  It was one booger on one key.  And we played the key on the air yesterday,  so when you hear that key, when Randy Newman's playing the piano,  you could be chuckling at home,  knowing that he might have got some goodness on his index finger.  Got some booger on him.  So we have to rework the whole booger on the key thing for Randy Newman today.  The great Randy Newman.  I think he even won an Oscar for his stuff.  Yeah, 877-212-ON-A, ONARadio.com. 
[00:09:30]  We have a very busy show.  We've got Generation Kill coming in here, right?  Yes.  A show that you've turned a lot of people on to.  One of my faves right now.  HBO comes up with some good series.  Yeah, we've got two of the guys coming in at 7.15.  What's the show about for the newbies out there?  It's about, well, it starts out where they got some troops in Kuwait waiting for the orders to go in.  And that's where it picks up when they start the invasion of Baghdad. 
[00:10:00]  Right.  And real good character development, a lot of action.  And what seems to me, without having been there, obviously, but just from hearing and reading things and seeing videotapes that are made by the soldiers and stuff,  that it's a pretty realistic take on what goes on over there.  And a lot of vets have said it's pretty realistic, the language and stuff and the screw-ups, things that happen. 
[00:10:30]  I like the cast.  It's pretty cool because it seems pretty accurate.  Like, the lieutenant isn't like this hardened lieutenant guy.  It's a goddamn kid.  You know, he's pretty much a kid just commanding his guys, which is pretty accurate.  But just a really, really good show.  A lot of, like I said, some action and then good dialogue and everything.  I just think it's one of those good HBO little miniseries that they put on. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, we'll be talking to two of the guys from that show in about an hour.  Jay in Tennessee.  Jay.  Boy, how are you?  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to tell Tank Hankress a good morning today.  It sounds like he's a character called E-Rock.  I don't know why you are calling him E-Rock.  Yeah, Jay's very mad that we called Tank Hankress E-Rock today.  Oh, Tank Hankress.  Yeah, I'm sorry that we called him E-Rock.  His new name is... 
[00:11:30]  Thank you, buddy.  Is it Tank Hankress?  Tank Hankress.  Yes, his name's Tank.  Tank Hankress.  Hey, Tank, you all right over there today?  Doing good this morning, Opie.  I hate Tank Hankress.  I can't look at him.  He makes my face scrunch up.  He's an idiot.  But I don't like the fact that he doesn't have his tank top on.  No, he's supposed to have a tank top.  Yeah, why didn't you bring in the tank top today, Tank?  Forgot about the tank top.  Sorry about that.  Why would Tank Hankress be sorry?  Yeah, Tank doesn't say sorry to anyone. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  But he also would have the tank top.  Yeah, he would.  He just would have it.  Yeah, keep typing.  Way to go.  That'll help the best.  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station.  Newman has won two, maybe three Oscars as Randy Newman.  He so totally deserves booger keys.  He deserves booger keys?  Well, actually, there was...  Yeah, actually, it started with a booger on a key,  and then Jimmy decided to take it to the next level by...  I put my bare bottom on it. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Yes.  Made a sound.  Yeah.  And then, yeah, you kind of used a disgusting part of your body.  Yeah, I stood in front of it, and I played it.  No, look, Ma, no hands.  Yeah, exactly.  Just picture a beanbag and just throw it down on the keys over and over again.  Repeatedly.  Yeah.  An onion-smelling beanbag.  Right.  That's how we treat an Oscar winner.  And we wonder why we have no guests.  We're such idiots.  Yes, Stunt Bray.  He has one Oscar win after, like, ten nominations. 
[00:13:00]  The guy finally won for Monsters, Inc., but he had nine or ten nominations  and then finally picked one up a couple years ago.  That's called Throwing the Old Guy a Bone.  Yep.  That was Throw the Old Guy a Bone, Oscar.  By the way, Randy Newman, not so talented.  Really?  He had one really good song that he has reworked for the last 25 years.  Really?  Yes.  Every Randy Newman song sounds pretty similar to his hit.  He had one great soundtrack from The Natural. 
[00:13:30]  I don't know if you remember the big rising music at the end,  and it's used now on all the movie trailers.  Yeah.  Really?  So he composes big symphonic stuff, but not hit songs.  All right.  He's actually pretty cool that way, but not hits.  Did you like Tropic Thunder?  I totally loved it.  I couldn't believe how absolutely offensive it was and funny on so many levels.  Oh, I like that.  Yeah, Tropic Thunder, I don't know what kind of reviews it's going to get.  I'm a little confused what the reviewers are going to do with this movie,  but, man, they did a private screening for the show yesterday, 
[00:14:00]  and it was me, Stunt Brain, Roland, and Patrice.  We all had a huge theater to ourselves.  Oh, nice.  It ruled.  I got a picture up on onaradio.com of Patrice just blending into the seats.  You can barely see him, but it's really, really funny.  And the movie, that's the one with Robert Downey Jr.  playing the black soldier from Vietnam.  Yeah.  Robert Downey Jr. is just one of the best actors working today or working in the last 20 years. 
[00:14:30]  He's just an amazing actor.  He plays an Australian dude with blonde hair and blue eyes that gets into this role as a black Vietnam soldier  by going through an operation to make him look black.  And he's like, he's now just a black guy.  He refuses to acknowledge his real name or any of that crap.  And he's in this movie that they're filming, Tropic Thunder, with a real black guy.  And he's just pissing off the real black guy. 
[00:15:00]  Because the real black guy is like, you're not black.  Stop.  Because they're talking about, what, slavery and reparations and everything.  And this real black guy is just giving him hell.  He's totally immersed in the character.  And he's so good.  You don't even remember it's Robert Downey until he puts that scene near the end.  Dude, he plays a black guy.  Patrice was losing his mind, laughing his ass off.  Oh, really?  He couldn't believe how good Robert Downey Jr. was playing the black guy.  We stood on 42nd Street after the movie for about a half an hour talking about it. 
[00:15:30]  Because everybody was just amazed at all of it.  Especially Downey and the big surprise.  Yeah, well, when you see Ben Stiller.  Ben Stiller hasn't had a good movie in a long time.  But I think this is going to save his career.  How do we explain this movie?  It's so weird.  It's a bunch of actors getting together to film this movie that goes wrong and then whatever.  We'll keep it at that.  But like Ben Stiller, before he did Tropic Thunder, did this movie Simple Jack where he played a retard. 
[00:16:00]  And when you see Ben Stiller as Simple Jack, you are going to lose your effing mind.  And Robert Downey Jr. as the black guy explained why he didn't win the Oscar.  Because what?  Because he went full retard.  Because he went full retard.  He goes, you dummy, to win an Oscar for playing a retard, you can't go full retard.  And then he explains how Tom Hanks didn't go full retard.  And Dustin Hoffman didn't go full retard. 
[00:16:30]  And Ben Stiller was all in full retard.  Full retard.  And Sean Penn did.  And that's why he went home empty-handed.  Yeah, he goes, and Sean Penn went full retard as well.  And see what happened to him?  You can't go full retard.  Oh, that's good.  Is there still a Ben Stiller Simple Jack in online?  Yeah.  Well, if not, I got the press kit came in yesterday.  Okay.  Let's take a picture of it and throw it up on onaradio.com.  You've got to see Ben Stiller as a retard.  Does he do a good retard?  Well, you know, it's a fake trailer for this movie that he was up for an Oscar or something 
[00:17:00]  like that, or was hoping to win an Oscar for.  And God, man, was that effing funny.  And then we're watching the movie, and they're not even advertising this, but Tom Cruise is  in the movie, and he's freaking hilarious.  Really?  He steals this movie, and you don't know it's Tom Cruise.  Has Tom Cruise ever been in a comedy?  A real comedy.  Now, I know he's funny in some of the roles he's done over the years.  Yeah, I can't.  Oh, my God.  Like an actual comedy where he's... 
[00:17:30]  His big move.  His big movie.  The one that broke him.  Not Rain Man.  No, Risky Business.  Risky Business, yeah.  Risky Business.  Losing It was a comedy he was in.  Yeah.  But I mean many years since he's probably been in it.  This is brilliant, this role for him.  He plays like either a studio head or...  An agency head.  He plays the head of the biggest agency in Hollywood.  And Patrice goes...  We're going to get Patrice on the air later on to talk about the movie, and also we got  Danny McBride, who was in the movie.  He's coming in to say hi to us today.  He was also in that movie Foot Fist Way that no one saw, which was hilarious. 
[00:18:00]  But anyway, Patrice goes, if the Jews don't protest over Tom Cruise's betrayal, he goes,  then something is wrong with this world.  Well, Patrice was just, what, ranting and raving on 42nd Street outside the theater.  Like, he's like, Tom Cruise hates Jews!  Just losing his mind.  He made...  Tom Cruise played a stereotypical Jew.  Really?  That was money hungry. 
[00:18:30]  And it was...  He was conniving.  He was eating.  He was a powerful, evil man.  Yeah.  This movie puts a stick in every piece of Hollywood, though.  It makes fun of the movie making business.  That's why I'm not sure if it's going to...  I'm not sure what the reviewers are going to do with this movie, because it's definitely  a bit on...  Not that we've ever made movies here, except for a little Jimmy Norton.  But, you know, it seems like it's a bit inside at times.  But I don't know.  It mocks actors, it mocks the studios, it mocks retarded people, it mocks black people, 
[00:19:00]  it mocks everyone.  Cruise is mocking the Jew.  Absolutely.  Wait till you get Patrice on the phone to talk about...  Look at their Simple Jack.  Look at Simple Jack.  They've got movie posters of him in the movie.  Oh, my God.  We'll get this up on onaradio.com.  What is this?  Stand next to a horse.  It's so good.  They got him with the really big teeth and the freckles under his eyes and the bowl haircut.  Full retard.  He went full retard. 
[00:19:30]  Let's say hi to Mark in Philly.  Good morning, Mark.  Yo, listen, just to touch on what the guy said yesterday about Jimmy, you rubbing your  ball back, or you rubbing your bag on that keyboard and all that.  Don't ever try to take the moral high ground in any situation, because what you're doing  is the same thing that you fight against, that bullying that you suffered back in high 
[00:20:00]  school.  It's the same thing you're doing right now.  It's like...  Wait, hold on.  Hold on.  Wait, wait.  Dude, what do you...  Wait.  Relax.  One thing at a time.  Relax.  What do you mean bullying in high school because I farted on a keyboard when a man wasn't there?  Well, a lot of people are trying to compare us doing what we did to Randy Newman.  They're trying to say that's the same thing they were doing to Mike Birbiglia at the comedy  show. 
[00:20:30]  That's a stretch.  That is a stretch, my friend.  No, it's not.  I mean, I'm disagreeing with him, not you.  I didn't hear the Birbiglia discussion.  Dude, so you're kind of coming in on me like...  But they're justifying booing Mike Birbiglia because they're like, what would you guys  do at your radio show?  I wasn't even at the show, but it's so true.  Let me ask you...  You're right, it is.  Let me ask you a question, though.  If you're going to make that comparison, which I don't know...  I have no idea what the Birbiglia discussion was.  I was in Los Angeles.  But if you're... 
[00:21:00]  We weren't happy that Mike got booed.  Right.  Once again, we're like, we almost had a perfect show.  I'll summarize.  And, you know, they started booing before they really gave Mike a true chance to show  what he had.  And a lot of people said, if you don't like the guy, just shut up and don't applaud and  don't say anything.  But people had a boo, and he got booed off stage.  And our point is, that's going to hurt us down the road when we try to book these huge  comedy festivals.  Well, dude, the difference is...  And now they're trying to justify the booing by saying, well, look, you guys don't give 
[00:21:30]  Randy Newman respect, and you do all this stuff on your show, so of course we've got to boo  when we see a comedian on stage we don't like.  Sir, let me ask you a question.  If you're going to make that comparison, how will goofing like we goof when he wasn't even  there going to affect his performance?  No, no.  Like, okay, that comparison, like that direct correlation, I'm not saying...  What I'm saying is to you, is that's the same bullying that you have, like, from listening 
[00:22:00]  to you for so long, and, like, you disdain that kind of bullying of people that you may  have suffered when you were in...  But what bullying?  Dude, what bullying?  Yeah, what was bullying?  The bullying of, like, rubbing your junk on somebody's keyboard is the same kind of...  It's not his keyboard.  ...main nonsense that you may...  You suffered when you were, you know, in high school.  No, well, here's what you're doing.  You're making the comparison almost like this is an Emilio Estevez pulling the ass hair off 
[00:22:30]  of whatever in the breakfast club.  That's not what this is.  It's not like he was sitting there ready to play the piano, and I ran over and farted on  it or rubbed my junk on it.  He wasn't there, which was kind of the goof.  It's not his piano, and what I did is not going to affect his performance.  Well, it's what he's going to play.  So what?  So it was like, yes, the whole thing was, let me, you know, do my... 
[00:23:00]  I know it's...  I can't speak on...  Well, you know what you mean.  All right, Mark.  Yeah, it's like you can't really justify it, like...  Yes, I can.  It was funny.  You can't pull that high moral...  You can't pull the moral high ground.  When do I do that?  Stuff like that.  When do I pull the moral high ground?  You do a lot, especially when it comes to dumb jocks pulling that same kind of...  So you don't see the difference between doing that and having a laugh over rubbing my junk  on a piano keyboard when the guy's not even there, when it's not going to affect his performance 
[00:23:30]  at all, or affect anybody watching his performance at all?  You can't see the difference between that and a bullying jock who's trying to intimidate  somebody?  No, no, no.  I see...  I think that behavior that you participated in by rubbing your whatever on that keyboard  is the same kind of behavior that a bullying jock would do, like, say, to your phone, like  you'd rub his whatever on your phone and laugh behind your back. 
[00:24:00]  That's the same...  No, a bullying jock, dude, the type of thing that we would do to make each other laugh, like  when my friend at lunch one time went and we sat on his hamburger and we farted on his  hamburger.  That's something you do to make each other laugh.  A bullying jock would rub his junk on your phone and then mush it into your face.  Right.  And, like, you can see the difference in intent.  One is to be silly and one is to dominate and humiliate.  Right.  There's a complete difference in intent, dude.  And so...  But I think the end result may be the same. 
[00:24:30]  I mean...  Nope, not at all.  Randy Newman will be playing on the Ronifest Show today, and no one will even know that there  was a booger on his piano.  I hate to tear down an effing wall because we like to think that the booger's still there.  But guess what?  The booger's long gone, and Randy Newman will play, and people will enjoy his performance.  Let's put a new booger on.  Yeah, we will try to put a new booger on today just to see if we can get a pass.  Get a good one.  And, Mark, how about the guys that used to hide Master Pose pieces over at XM? 
[00:25:00]  They would hide his chest pieces.  That's the same type of obnoxious thing.  You tell me that was a bullying thing?  And the guy's a black belt in karate.  No, no.  What I'm saying is that...  Oh, my God, Mark.  What I'm saying is we've got to move on with the effing radio show.  You made your point.  We don't agree.  It's not an accurate...  We're going to have to agree to disagree.  That old gag.  We've got to move on.  I can agree.  He's a douche.  It's not an accurate...  You can't spend ten effing minutes on this.  We completely don't agree with people booing a guy before he had a chance to do his thing. 
[00:25:30]  And the reason is because, you know, we've got to think of the big picture.  And people...  And I did read one thing where someone said, well, you should have went on earlier.  Geraldo went on right before him and murdered.  And when Herrera got booed or Jimmy Schubert got booed, they were on very early in Philadelphia.  It just...  It happens.  It doesn't matter what part of the show you're on.  If people are going to boo you, like they would have booed early.  Booyah.  Booyah!  And there were a lot of guys that said no because they're a little scared of the audience. 
[00:26:00]  And that's what we're trying to fix.  So we could get even bigger comics performing for these shows.  See, people get booed at...  I was forgetting some of the guys that said no.  You've got to add Dennis Leary to the list.  We said Saget.  Brian Regan said no.  Stephen Lynch said no.  David Tell said no.  Nick DiPaolo said no.  Who else, Jimmy?  Jimmy Fallon, Fallon.  Jimmy Fallon said no.  Fallon was... 
[00:26:30]  No.  Fallon was...  We got some inside info on that from Patrice O'Neill.  What?  From the Montreal Comedy Fest.  It turned out Fallon was nervous of what he heard.  The animation festival, the booing that happened at the animation festival really, really hurt  us as far as booking this Viva show this year.  It really hurt us.  Yeah, he has one of what we get and have public embarrassment before he goes on and hosts  the show.  I can't get that.  You know, the list of names I just gave you, that's the big leagues right there.  And those guys said no. 
[00:27:00]  And it's not because they don't like us or don't like the show.  They were a bit...  For the most part, you know, they were intimidated.  Maybe a couple guys in there really couldn't do it for other reasons, but that's what we  heard over and over again this year.  All right, we've got to move on.  We've got lots to do today.  We've got the Never Go Full retard clip.  Oh, wait, sorry.  I was just watching the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 trailer.  Ooh.  Well, we'll talk about that after the break.  It's getting good reviews, my friend.  Stop.  Yes, we'll talk about that.  Stop it. 
[00:27:30]  Stop it.  We got the clip from Tropic Thunder, Never Go Full Retard.  And, of course, there's controversy over Simple Jack from Tropic Thunder.  We'll get into that next.  They had to take some websites down already.  Oh, good.  Really?  They just put them up, and now they took them down because people aren't happy.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  We've got a busy show today.  Opie and Anthony, good morning to everybody.  Oh, God.  Good morning to the participants of the show as well.  You know who you are.  You've got your Coke Logic. 
[00:28:00]  You've got your Fast Freddy.  Oh, yeah.  You've got your Steve from Bayshore.  Steve.  You've got Scott from Hobbog.  You've got your Kern Flakes.  You've got your 20 Legs of Lamb.  877-212-O-N-A.  So, we've got a couple guys from Generation Kill coming in in about 15, 20 minutes.  Still talking about this Tropic Thunder.  We've got Danny McBride coming in.  Who's he in the movie?  He was like a special effects guy in the movie.  Danny McBride is one of these guys you're going to know in the coming years. 
[00:28:30]  He is a funny mofo.  He was in this really weird movie called Foot Fist Way.  They thought it was going to be kind of like a Napoleon Dynamite and kind of take off.  It never really took off, unfortunately.  The first time I saw the movie, I was like, what the hell is this?  And then I watched it a second time with some people and laughed my ass off.  Yeah.  He's like a Taekwondo instructor and he thinks he's all that.  I remember that when it came out.  I saw the trailer for it and it looked really funny but never saw the movie.  It's definitely quirky. 
[00:29:00]  If you're looking for something a little quirky and you want to recite some weird lines from this movie, I suggest you go find it.  Foot Fist Way.  You just missed, by the way, you said you saw Godfrey at the gym?  Yeah, yeah.  I saw him last night.  He goes, oh man, right after he left, Shaquille O'Neal came in.  We hung out for like three hours.  Ooh.  At the gym?  Yeah, Shaq's a big fan of Godfrey's.  You just missed the Shaq.  You missed Shaq.  Are you kidding me?  By a very short time.  You missed Shaq.  Yeah.  That's unbelievable.  They had a pickup game. 
[00:29:30]  Really?  Yeah.  I guess it's probably silly but yeah.  How'd he do?  Yeah, right?  It was only 148 to four.  Shaq had a stroke and Godfrey scored two.  Shaq was playing hoops at that gym?  I think so, yeah.  Oh my God.  I would have loved to have seen that.  Yeah.  Yeah, too.  Oh man.  I would have loved to have taken an elbow from Shaq.  How great would that be?  Down low and just take an elbow to the head.  Of course, he would have to bend way down to do it.  But it would be a privilege to take an elbow from Shaq.  If I ever meet Shaq, every moment we're together is going to be, how can I sue him? 
[00:30:00]  What can he do to somehow injure me where I cannot really get hurt and get a nice hunk  of change?  Steps on my foot, 80,000.  I hope that would hurt.  I told you the Shaq story when I went on vacation, right?  I met Shaq, but I didn't get a picture.  And we were staying in this pretty nice hotel down there in the Caribbean and somebody was  making a lot of noise above me, just walking across the floor.  And I was like, who the F is that?  And we found out the next day that, oh, it was Shaq. 
[00:30:30]  So thank God I didn't go up there to his room.  Can you keep it down in there?  This big clotting feet.  Just going across the floor.  So anyway, Tropic Thunder, I was explaining how Ben Stiller, there was a trailer for a  fake movie called Simple Jack where Ben Stiller was the star and he was really bummed out that  he didn't win an Oscar for his performance because, you know, a lot of guys win Oscars 
[00:31:00]  for playing slow people, for playing retards.  And he didn't understand why his Simple Jack character didn't win the Oscar.  And then another character in this movie explained to Ben Stiller's character why he didn't  win for Simple Jack.  Here it is.  Listen to this.  There were times when I was doing Jack that I actually felt retarded, like really retarded.  In a weird way, I had to sort of just free myself up to believe that it was okay to be stupid  or dumb. 
[00:31:30]  To be moron.  Yeah.  To be moronical.  Exactly.  An imbecile.  Yeah.  When I was playing the character.  When you was the character.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, as Jack.  Definitely.  It's that work of Mercury.  It's high science, man.  It's art form.  Yeah.  You an artist.  It's what we do, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everybody knows you never go full retarded.  What do you mean?  Check it out.  Dustin Hoffman, Rayman, Luke Retarded, Act Retarded.  Not retarded.  Cat 2 Picks, Cheetah Cards. 
[00:32:00]  Autistic.  Sure.  Not retarded.  You know, Tom Hanks, Forrest Gump.  Slow, yes, retarded, maybe.  Braces on his legs.  But he's trying to pay himself next to him.  And he won a ping pong competition.  That ain't retarded.  You an full retard, man.  Never go full retard.  Full retard.  It's also an accurate and great statement.  Yes.  Of course, it is.  Of course, it is.  Hollywood reward. 
[00:32:30]  It's great.  And that voice, that's Robert Downey Jr. as the black guy.  Wow.  Believe it or not.  Yeah.  Who he sounds like?  He sounds like Keith David, the black dude from Platoon.  Who was...  Yeah.  Yeah, that's who he sounds like.  He probably was biting off that character.  No.  Well, just because it was a Vietnam spoof.  Mm-hmm.  Brian, Chicago, what's going on?  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Morning, Mimi.  Hi, buddy.  Well, as part of Tropic Thunder's ad campaign, they actually made a realistic website for 
[00:33:00]  the movie Simple Jack, like they would for any movie that they make.  And apparently some disability advocate groups got really upset by the portrayal of a retard  in the movie.  And so they actually went to DreamWorks and complained that they wanted...  ...to have every single bit of Simple Jack taken out of the movie.  Oh, God.  Stop.  But they got it to the point where they actually took the website down. 
[00:33:30]  They complained enough that DreamWorks said, okay, we'll take the website down, but we're  not changing the movie.  I wonder, and again, maybe they're not smart enough in advance to do this, but DreamWorks  had to know that they're going to hear crap.  They're not idiots.  So maybe they...  What can we give them?  They're going to bitch and moan.  Oh.  We'll put up a website.  Put up a website.  They're going to complain.  A sacrificial lamb.  And let them feel like they got something done.  I'm hoping that they're smart enough to have done that.  Brian, could someone answer the question why we can't make fun of retards? 
[00:34:00]  I'm from the school.  You should be able to make fun of everything.  It's insensitive.  It's picking on the vulnerable, the defenseless, the parents that have children that are mentally  handicapped feel very sensitive about it.  That's what it is.  But when you got a spoof movie, yeah, you should be able to spoof anything. 
[00:34:30]  It's not like...  See, I have a problem.  I have a line.  I'm not going to walk up to a mentally handicapped person in a store, perhaps, or with their parents  or something, and start pointing and laughing.  Of course not.  I wouldn't do that.  Right.  But in the context of dark comedy, inappropriate comedy, the stuff that makes people laugh,  it's fair game.  Yeah.  Like anything else is. 
[00:35:00]  Would you bother a retard if, say, he just wasn't playing the right song cues during a bit?  That's smacking in the head.  Yeah, that's you, E-Rock.  Tropic Thunder's...  Hank Hankerous.  Tropic Thunder's Simple Jack website went bye-bye.  So here's the story.  After disability advocate groups raised issues with Tropic Thunder's repeated use of the word  retard and other offensive terms to describe a role played by Ben Stiller's character in the movie,  DreamWorks has agreed to meet with them.  It's almost certainly too late to change the actual film, which comes out a week from 
[00:35:30]  tomorrow.  That's a huge part of the film, and it's hilarious.  It's not going to change it.  But Vulture reports, whatever that is, I guess it's a magazine or something, that the first  casualty appears to be the promotional website for Simple Jack, one of the fake movies within  the movie, in which Ben Stiller plays a mentally handicapped adult, and which has the unfortunate  tagline, once upon a time, there was a retard.  That's a great tagline.  The only thing more confounding than the total predictability of this news is the fact that 
[00:36:00]  the Tropic Thunder Red Band trailer, which was released in mid-May, contains more than  enough clues to the potential offensiveness of the Simple Jack subplot.  If advocate groups had acted then, maybe there would have been time to change the actual  movie and not just remove a website, which raises an insane question.  Is it possible that Tropic Thunder's over $30 million overhyping campaign failed to reach  everyone in America?  Whatever.  So, oh, it is funny. 
[00:36:30]  It would be a shame if they took all this out of the movie because people complained in  advance.  No, it's too late now.  It's out there, man.  Because I'm surprised DreamWorks is, normally the big ones like that are the hypersensitive  ones, like, you know, because they have so much at stake.  I'm surprised.  They had to know.  You can't put out a website with the tagline, one day there was a retard, and I don't expect  you to hear crap about it.  Ben Stiller's always had some, you know, pretty...  He's twisted.  Yeah, pretty sick stuff that's a little controversial as far as characters go.  He tries to play both ways. 
[00:37:00]  He's like mainstream, but no, he's twisted, man.  These advocate groups are starting to call it the R word, by the way.  Are you kidding me?  There you go.  In some of the literature that I got in front of me.  The R word?  That's way too much to start reading on the air.  That's because they're too dumb to say it.  Well, I'll read this sentence.  Get it?  And report that what many call the R word reinforces negative social attitudes just  as surely as racial, ethnic, and sexually oriented slurs do. 
[00:37:30]  Do you know what retarded means?  It's like something that's held back.  Yeah.  It's retarded.  Yeah.  It's pulled back.  It's not quite there.  It's accurate.  I've been called retarded for a while.  Can we play the Drew Boogie thing really fast?  It makes me laugh every time.  Hi, who's this?  My name is Liam, and I like to wear dresses.  R.  Yeah.  E.  Goodness gracious. 
[00:38:00]  P.  Yeah.  A.  Oosh.  R.  D.  T.  Retard.  Retard.  Yeah.  Woo.  Be retarded.  Be.  Be.  Retarded.  Be.  Retarded.  Be.  Be.  Retarded.  Stop your hands and clap your feet.  Retardation can't be beat.  You know.  You know.  You know we retarded.  P.  A.  R.  E.  P.  A.  R.  E.  Retard.  Retard. 
[00:38:30]  Yay.  Woo.  When it was we tonight, we're dresses.  Okay.  Terrific.  Yeah.  When did we do that?  We didn't do that.  It was a couple lines we threw out there, and then Drew Boogie took them and made a mix  of a song.  That's amazing.  We didn't actually go in a studio and come up.  No, no.  I know.  I'm just trying to think of when we did the.  That's the brilliance of Drew Boogie.  He takes a few lines from a bunch of different shows and makes it sound that we were working  really hard at a studio.  He is good. 
[00:39:00]  You know what these groups do, and this is why I hate these advocacy groups, when they  get offended at the language, it's because they're selective.  It's like if you're portraying their subject the way they deem appropriate, they want it  to be allowed.  If you're not portraying it the way they want it to be portrayed, they don't want it to  be allowed.  Yeah.  That's why they're so disgusting.  Yeah.  Take it out.  Like, remove it.  If you don't say what we want you to say about this subject, we don't want it to be  said.  So they can spin it any way they want.  That's all it is.  Anthony, did you explain what retarded means? 
[00:39:30]  Did I interrupt you?  Yeah, I explained it.  Okay, I wasn't sure.  It makes perfect sense when you're talking about somebody that might have a mental handicap  like that.  They're mentally retarded.  Let's go to Tracy in Philly.  Tracy.  Hi.  How are you guys doing?  Good.  Hi.  I teach special needs kids and it's like really ridiculous now the terminology that  we have to use.  If a kid is now diagnosed like by definition mentally retarded, we're not allowed to call  them that anymore.  We have to call them intellectually challenged. 
[00:40:00]  But like they're mentally retarded.  No, it's funny about that though.  This is what people don't understand.  All right.  So we start calling them intellectually challenged, right?  Fast forward two years and people are going to be like, how dare you say intellectually  challenged?  It's not a challenge.  Right, right.  You're saying their intellect is being challenged?  I think the problem is you're implying they have one.  Yeah.  Because this is progressing.  It started out as, oh, look at the waterhead.  Oh, you can't say waterhead. 
[00:40:30]  What are you not saying?  He's retarded.  He's a little slower than people.  I don't like slow either.  Right.  So then you start using the term retarded too much and then they come up with a new term  and then we're going to use that term and then they're going to have to come up with  something else.  That's just how it works.  It's whenever a word starts being used for something else.  That's when people get mad.  Right.  Like it was fine to say, yes, that child is retarded until regular Joes started talking  to their friends and go, dude, you're being retarded, you know, get out of there. 
[00:41:00]  Right.  You're being a retard.  Stop being retarded.  And then they get mad because it becomes a negative thing with regular people.  And I do say regular people.  We all know what I mean.  Don't make me have to try to define it.  What do you mean by regular?  What's normal really?  We all know what normal is.  Right.  You look, you could tell.  Yeah.  I mean, when we were at the PNC, you know, we're on that stage in front of, I don't know,  close to 10,000 people.  You look out and you see retards. 
[00:41:30]  Exactly.  Big fat retards.  Hey, before we move on, but we do have Danny McBride from Tropic Thunder coming in in about  an hour.  Sorry.  It's catchy.  I got another clip of Robert Downey Jr. playing the black guy.  Mm-hmm.  Listen to what he does here.  Just another little taste of this movie, Tropic Thunder, that we definitely enjoyed yesterday.  And Patrice is calling in because he was out of his mind after the movie.  Did he like it?  Oh, he loved it.  And I hope he does his Tom Cruise rant for everybody because it was just amazing. 
[00:42:00]  Here's Robert Downey Jr. as a black guy.  For your information, my revenue stream...  I got a little setup.  He's talking to the real black guy.  Okay.  So he's acting with a real black guy and Robert Downey Jr. is playing fake black guy, but  he's taking it way too seriously.  Right.  For your information, my revenue stream currently generates $2 million a year in charitable  contributions to my community.  I think.  And why am I in this movie?  Maybe I just knew I had to represent. 
[00:42:30]  Because they had one good part in for a black man.  They gave it to Crocodile Dundee.  Pump your brakes, kid.  That man's the national treasure.  I just wanted to throw another shrimp on you, Bobby.  That ain't funny.  I'm sorry.  A dingo ate your baby.  You know that's the true story?  Lady lost the kid.  You about to cross the line.  Man, I'm sick of this koala-hugging the...  For 400 years, that work has kept us down. 
[00:43:00]  What the...  Took a whole lot of trying just to get up that hill.  You know we up in the big leagues.  Kidnaught turn it back.  Long as it lives it's you and me, baby.  That's the theme song for the Jeffersons.  You really need help.  And just because the theme song, don't make it not true.  Don't make it not true.  Sounds like Batman.  Who's that black guy that he's acting with?  I forgot his name. 
[00:43:30]  You would recognize him.  He's been in a lot of stuff.  You better recognize.  Sounds like Kevin Hart.  I don't know.  I'll have to be honest with you.  I would have told you.  Yeah, Patrice would know.  All right.  Why don't we go to break with Special Olympics?  Sure, from Stephen Lynch.  Oh, I don't know.  Wraps up this nice break we just did for the fine folks out there.  Generation Kill.  A couple guys coming in in a few minutes.  Yes.  We'll get into other things like a man murdered over a beer after the break as well.  With some really funny audio from I think an eyewitness or something like that. 
[00:44:00]  Well, obviously not the victim yet.  Here, let's play this.  Watch them run.  Watch them fall.  Watch them try to catch a ball.  Olympics.  Oh, boy.  Watch them laugh.  Watch them drool.  Watch them fall into the pool.  That's diving.  At the Special Olympics. 
[00:44:30]  You're such a penny.  And I know full well  That I will burn in hell  But those guys playing wheelchair basketball  Gotta be about the funniest freaking thing I've ever seen in my life  At the Special Olympics. 
[00:45:00]  Take it quirky.  At the Special Olympics.  Oh, you sure sing pretty.  You can sing at my wedding when I get married.  Opie and Anthony.  A little Jimmy Norton.  We got a couple guys from Generation Kill coming into the studio here.  Sundays, 9 o'clock on H-B-O. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  Great show.  And I think it's, yeah, PJ.  PJ from Generation Kill.  He's Ziggy from The Wire.  So who gives a crap about Generation Kill?  What, are you kidding?  I want to talk about The Wire with Ziggy from Season 2.  Generation Kill is great.  From the docks.  I just like how, well, Lee was in Oz.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They just kind of wander around from one of these shows to the next. 
[00:46:00]  Is he really?  Yeah.  How cool is it to have two, you know, two chances on HBO, two different shows?  It's amazing.  Hey, there you go.  The Wire for Jimmy so Ziggy could sign it.  That's the wrong season.  You can see the season five.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Jimmy, Anthony, you never saw The Wire?  Oh, you rock.  What did he give you?  Generation Kill.  Oh, nice.  Maybe a couple episodes.  Nice.  But have an air in you.  Very cool. 
[00:46:30]  Have a little film festival.  Oh, wow.  Hey, Ziggy.  What's up?  There he is.  Ziggy, you called him.  Jesus.  No, I don't even want to.  Huh?  I don't even flinch when I get called that.  No.  But that's a good thing that people recognize you.  It's totally flattering.  I got to tell you, you made, I know we're going to talk about Generation Kill, and I also  heard you saw Tropic Thunder, so we got a lot to do with you today.  But you made, I got to just tell you, I'm a huge Wire fan, me and Jimmy.  Jimmy turned me on to it.  And you made season two, the whole doc, the season that focused on the docs. 
[00:47:00]  You made that season.  Oh, thanks, man.  Thanks a lot.  You completely made that season.  Thank you.  There's a great scene you do where, let's just say, he commits a really violent shooting,  and then you're confessing to the police, and in the statement, the one thing you wanted  to change was, like, he was asking you for mercy, and you're like, no, no, beg.  Can you please beg?  That was such a great, great scene that showed you everything you needed to know about how  good that felt for him to shoot those guys.  It was really tremendous.  Begged.  Yeah.  Oh, there he is.  Good morning. 
[00:47:30]  Good morning.  So we got PJ, of course, Ziggy.  Well, his real name's PJ.  And we got Lee also from Generation Kill.  I just want to go back to PJ for a second before we move on.  So you saw Tropic Thunder?  Oh, yeah.  It was amazing.  It was totally amazing.  It was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  You know what was funny is I've been waiting for that movie to come out for months, months,  months, and then we were actually doing ADR with David Simon, and I was like, and I had  already seen the trailer online.  I was like, David, you have to look at this. 
[00:48:00]  I was like, it's about 40 actors in a war movie, and he was like, I can't believe we  didn't write this script.  But then I heard that they're really freaking, you know, that disability groups are really  upset about.  Simple Jack, the role that Ben Stiller played in a fake movie.  That's so stupid.  That is so stupid, because it's actually just making fun of actors.  It's a spoof, yeah.  I mean, yeah.  You look at things like Forrest Gump or any of those, it's totally acceptable.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, he went full retard. 
[00:48:30]  That was the brilliance of that scene.  You can't go full.  Everybody knows you don't go fully retarded.  Look at your pen.  2001.  I am saying man walked home and dead.  I didn't know that.  That's so good.  You must really start getting recognized a lot now for Generation Kill.  No, not really.  Really?  No.  Because you're, like, really kind of a very popular character on that.  You're in a lot of the episodes.  I wouldn't call me popular.  No, I think that's pretty popular.  The real smart ass and just out there and kind of a loose cannon. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  A loose cannon.  A loose cannon.  You're making me sound like I'm in a buddy cop movie.  Yeah.  He's the loose cannon.  You're real.  Then there's the older guy that says, I'm getting too old for this crap.  Yeah.  But, no, your character's great.  It's one of those, yeah, you're really kind of on the edge there, off the wall, eating  the speed all the time.  Eating the red fuel.  The ephedra.  Not sleeping and just going off on these tangents. 
[00:49:30]  That the journalist here, Lee, just seems to really enjoy.  I like when he says something and you, being the Rolling Stone writer, just kind of goes  like, oh, wow.  Like, oh, this is good stuff.  Yeah.  Where did you get a lot of the material?  Was it taken from a lot of actual soldiers, interviews with these guys?  No, no, no.  Well, since we're all playing real people, most of that stuff is actually stuff that Ray  Persson said.  Really?  Yeah, during the invasion of, yeah, during OIF-1.  And, like, if you meet him now, you know, he's this really mild-mannered guy from Missouri. 
[00:50:00]  He's really sweet.  He's one of the coolest people I've ever met.  But, you know, I guess Evan wrote a new afterword in the new edition of Generation  Kill, and he was talking to Ray about it.  And Ray was like, dude, I didn't know you were going to put all that stuff in the book.  You know, he's like, he's like, I don't talk like that.  We were invading a country, you know?  Like, so most of the stuff that, a lot, yeah, so I think about 90% of what my dialogue 
[00:50:30]  is, like, kind of verbatim what Josh said.  Really?  Yeah.  It's, and a lot of soldiers have said it's a pretty accurate depiction of what's going  on over there.  Yeah, I mean, that's what, I guess that's what the most interesting thing about the whole  project has been so far is that, you know, like, people to the far left have a really,  you know, have a reaction to it, and people to the far right have a really serious reaction  to it.  But then most of the veterans are like, no, this is pretty close.  Yeah, it's pretty close to what it is. 
[00:51:00]  Which is, you know, the best of what, you know, I think we could have, I think that that's  what we hoped for from the beginning.  Well, yeah, I think that's cool, because it's not really an agenda, because I really, I was  a little kind of apprehensive going into it, thinking, all right, is this going to be  one way or another?  Is it going to have this kind of agenda and this message, and, you know, but it just  kind of rolls and lets you get kind of an insight on what these guys are going through, and  I think that's cool.  And you do get kind of a view from the left and the right, based on what character is 
[00:51:30]  talking.  Right.  Which is pretty cool.  Yeah, you don't go over there, and, you know, like, all of a sudden, like, there's some,  you know, there's a marine, like, the translucent bald eagle head, like, floating in the background  and one tear and, like, a flag, and then all of a sudden he's, like, still living, you  know, God bless America!  You know, like, that's without nuance, you know?  Like, of course there's going to be people to the left and people to the right, even in  the service.  What kind of reactions have you guys gotten from the left and the right?  Are people, like, are you getting criticism from both ways?  Do they feel like you're not representing them properly? 
[00:52:00]  Properly?  Um, I mean, I don't know.  Like, some of the stuff I've read is, like, this is liberal garbage.  And then, you know, I mean, I don't know.  I can't wait to hear how the person who likes it sounds.  It sounds like a moral.  Hey, you're just stupid.  Yeah.  That would be all intelligence sounding.  And the person who really likes it, you know, thinks it's a meaningful...  I've got one voice, man.  I use it for all my characters.  No, you're right.  The guy who likes it is never like, it's really good. 
[00:52:30]  With this stupid voice.  I'm amazed at the production of it, too.  I mean, it's a giant scale.  It looks great.  When you're trying to depict an invasion of a country, you can't really do it with,  like, two Humvees and a few guys.  They really did a great job of making this look huge.  I mean, when those vehicles are rolling down Saddam's highways, obviously,  CGI, but really a great job. 
[00:53:00]  It looks fantastic, the production value.  Where was it filmed?  We were in Namibia, South Africa, and Mozambique.  Wow.  Most of the time in South Africa.  A few shots for that one.  Yeah, a few shots, some pills.  Yeah, malaria.  Well, the pills I brought.  But the shots, yes.  So you guys, the whole season is done.  You just shot the whole season.  Yeah, we were there for seven months last year.  HBO is great.  They don't back off, even if they get criticized about things.  They normally will not allow criticism of content to kind of get in the way. 
[00:53:30]  I mean, The Sopranos got criticized.  The Wire, why do you think it is you guys never got nominated?  It's a disgrace that you were never nominated for an Emmy.  I don't know.  I mean, because at the end of the day, let's face it, I think most award shows are just popularity contests.  And the thing is that as well-received as it was, it wasn't the most popular show in the entire world.  And it takes a lot of dedication. 
[00:54:00]  And you can't be that stupid if you're watching that show.  You have to invest.  You have a lot of intellectual investment to do with that show.  That's what a lot of the HBO miniseries, you kind of do.  You have to invest some time.  You have to have a little bit of intellect to get into the characters.  Because I love how the characters have developed in Generation Kill.  There's racist guys.  There's cool guys. 
[00:54:30]  There's guys that are there for the cause.  There's guys that could give a crap.  Yeah.  So it's really accurate.  And that's exactly what I liked about the book when I read the book.  It's just so honest.  And I didn't finish it.  I didn't feel like I had been fed a point of view.  I felt like I just saw these guys.  And they're just doing what they're doing.  And it was a really accurate account of what people are like.  Yeah.  One part I really liked that almost put out like a bad light on the soldiers was goofing 
[00:55:00]  on the letters that came from the kids writing from school.  Like that was.  But I laughed my ass off.  And it's like, yeah.  Of course these guys.  They're trained.  They're Marines.  Trained to kill.  And they're reading letters from kids going, I hope you don't have to go to war.  And then these guys are like, yeah, you fag.  Of course I want to go to war.  You know.  This is what I'm trained to do.  Kill.  You know.  So.  And they're goofing on.  They send little pictures.  And this little girl sent her a picture.  And they're passing around going, yeah, look. 
[00:55:30]  This one's hot.  You know.  It's just.  It was so wrong and so funny.  And you know that that happens.  You know.  You know.  It's not like one of those old time war movies where they're like, this is what it's  all about.  The children.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, that's another thing to point out too when people are like.  That's been the one thing that I was really worried about that, you know.  And again, it almost ties into what we were talking about.  With Tropic Thunder.  This like.  People are way too sensitive about content and stuff.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, man.  All right.  Easy. 
[00:56:00]  I'm sorry, Lee.  I'm a little sensitive about.  I know you're.  I know you're white.  I know.  Sorry.  I didn't mean to bring it up.  The big W word.  Not white.  It's not like American.  Right, right, right, right.  You're the Libertarian Party.  No.  But like.  I don't like all the dialogue where people are like, this is really racist.  Or really homophobic.  It's like.  It's gallows humor, man.  Right.  You know, if you're with your brothers.  Like, it doesn't matter.  You know, it doesn't matter what race, ethnic background you are. 
[00:56:30]  You know, like.  Where you're from.  Like, you're going to take anything that you see about somebody that's different from you.  And just pick it apart.  Yeah.  Because you have nothing to do.  It's gallows humor.  And then for people to call it.  Do we use the gallows anymore?  So it's outdated humor?  Is that what you're saying?  It's hard to say lethal injection humor, though.  It doesn't have that same feel to it.  Yeah.  And it's cool, too, because that Led Zeppelin song.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hang me.  Hang me.  Yeah. 
[00:57:00]  I guess, Lee, now, it's probably great to be in a series where maybe people forget you've got your ass tattooed by Schillinger in Oz.  Well, I don't know if they edited it out, but every time I sit down in that seat, I'm like.  Just, you know, just like, remember that?  A little inside, yeah.  That was, now, that was a hell of a series, because when you have man junk in the opening sequence when the credits are rolling, that was, that show Oz, and the ladies would just sit down and love it, because every episode, there was going to be full frontal nudity from a guy. 
[00:57:30]  Absolutely.  One of the seasons, we were shooting some while some were airing, and the one that was airing was the one where Chris Maloney peed in a bucket, right?  Yeah.  And so one of the older guys who was, like, you know, working on the show was, like, sitting at the thing.  He went, last night, the show went too far. 
[00:58:00]  That went too far.  When Chris Maloney peed in the bucket, my wife was so disgusted, she got up and went into the bedroom for the rest of the night.  And I looked at him, and I said, wait a minute, dude, she sees Chris Maloney pissing in a bucket, and she goes into the bedroom because she's disgusted?  Come on.  Yeah, that show was very popular with the ladies after a while.  Yeah, it was.  It picked up.  Hey, did Tony, that's a weird question.  Did Tony Massante die in between seasons?  Because the way he kind of went off the show, like, they were giving, putting, like, crushed glass in his food, and then he was just gone. 
[00:58:30]  Why did he not come back?  I was like, I wonder if he died in between seasons.  No, he died in the last, because he, like, all of a sudden just erupts with blood one day, right?  That was how he ended in episode eight of the first season.  I would love to have him come back to season two.  I was like, awesome.  Yeah, he was great.  I was so psyched.  You know, when I was, like, a little kid, I used to watch Toma and stuff like that.  Did you ever see the first movie, his movie with Martin Sheen, The Incident, where they're on a subway train with Ed McMahon, they take it over? 
[00:59:00]  Ed Mc, Jesus.  No, no, him and Martin Sheen take over the train.  Ed McMahon is there with a baby.  The Incident, yeah.  Oh, great.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  We're going to wreck the conversation.  Yeah.  Sorry.  That's a thing, Dad.  Sorry.  I don't remember that one.  Hey, I want to say hello to my girlfriend, Yuko, who's listening to a car radio right now, driving up to Sing Sing.  Hey, Yuko.  Sing Sing?  Why up to Sing Sing?  Go to see her other boyfriend.  Yeah.  I said, I don't want to get into that.  I just want to say hello to her and everybody that's in that car. 
[00:59:30]  You shouldn't have said Sing Sing, then.  Yeah, it's a tough one I can pass up.  Yeah, really.  All right.  We'll just let that one go.  Just the upstate's good enough.  Yeah, you should.  Right.  Driving north of here.  No, with a...  It's a Northwest Chester.  Wait a minute.  Back to a Generation Kill.  I'm waiting.  I'm just waiting for a popular character to buy it because, obviously, we have to have a little reality here, a little reality check.  I'm not going to ask anything I know you're not going to tell me, but is something tragic in the future here? 
[01:00:00]  Well, if you read the book, you can find out.  Well, I don't want to...  See, I don't want to read the book now.  I don't want to know what's going to happen.  I just...  They didn't...  I mean, I'd say that, you know, like, whatever's in the book is going to be there on the screen, and almost none of it, as far as, like, a story arc and its gross sense, none of it has been fabricated.  So, yeah.  And The Godfather is a great, great gruff character. 
[01:00:30]  At first, I thought he was, you know, a stand-up guy and stuff, and then you realize, oh, my God, this guy's just out for himself, kind of doesn't care really about what's going on, just, let's get into the game!  Yeah.  Is his voice really screwed like that?  No, I mean, the actual guy's voices, but the actor just did that for the...  But it was funny, because...  How the hell do you do that during the entire filming?  Well, the funny thing was, there was a read-through, and, because there was a couple of guys, you know, Alexander's from Sweden, so he was working on an accent, you know, an American accent. 
[01:01:00]  And then the voice guy immediately went over to Chance Kelly, who plays Ferrando, and was like, dude, I need to talk to you, because you cannot do that, you know, continually without really messing up your voice.  Destroying your voice, yeah.  Wow.  But, you know, that's the art.  You know, you do it.  You don't care.  Cross into the wind. 
[01:01:30]  I'm always amazed when somebody has an accent, like, back on the wire, like the guys, like Dominic, and they're like, you know, these guys are British, they're from all over the place, and it's like, I'm such a dope, I just assumed they were raised in Baltimore or Jersey somewhere.  Oh, no, man, you know that Baltimore accent, which is the same as, like, the Philly one.  It's horrendous.  Oh, it's amazing.  Anthony does a great Baltimore accent.  What?  Accent.  Well, because of Sal.  Oh, Sal.  Come on, dance, Bubba.  No, come on, Sal does it all.  Joseph!  Joseph!  Oh, that's pretty...  Put on Christmas shoes!  Yeah, that's pretty good. 
[01:02:00]  Ready?  Me and Crystal are going to the State Fair this weekend.  It's going to be awesome.  It's going to be so awesome.  And I did the Ziggy accent, and I went home for Thanksgiving, and, like, one of my aunt's friends was there.  She was like, we don't talk like that down here.  Down here, down here.  I was like, oh, jeez.  What's going on?  What's going on?  Actually, John Travolta does a really good Baltimore in Hairspray.  Have you seen that?  No, I didn't see it.  I saw part of it last night.  It's so distracting to watch him in that getup.  I know.  It's weird, right?  It just looks so right. 
[01:02:30]  It really does.  It really looks so right.  You think he flies this plane in it?  I'm sure he does.  Get on, people who no one else sees, because you come to the house and you sneak in.  How bad do you have to love it when you buy your own plane?  No paparazzi up here.  There's safety at 35,000 feet.  There sure is.  Somebody buzzes you in a helicopter with a camera.  Hey, I got to ask PJ, you prevented a rape?  Yeah. 
[01:03:00]  While living in New York City?  Yeah, I did.  Back in what?  2006?  Cockblocker.  Hey, buddy.  Listen, I've been here all night, man.  What happened, man?  That's crazy.  I was sitting in my apartment and I had heard my dad.  Girl comes over, I'm real horny, and I just decided, nope.  Yeah.  That's pretty much it.  I was like, not again. 
[01:03:30]  I'm not going down this road again.  No, my upstairs neighbor, I heard my upstairs neighbor screaming for help, and I ran downstairs  and I saw this guy trying to rape my upstairs neighbor, and I ran back upstairs and told  my girlfriend at the time, I was like, lock yourself in the apartment, and I was like,  you know, call the police, tell them that there's a rape happening, so I ran downstairs  and I chased this dude down the street, and I whooped his ass with a metal bar, and then 
[01:04:00]  we got pinned between two doors, and he closed, and it all happened really fast, but he ended  up getting five years in prison.  What made you chase him?  That's really ballsy.  No kidding.  As opposed to just getting him off the person, what made you just run after him?  I don't know.  I don't know.  You see that, and you get pretty mad, I guess.  I mean, it was really that, like...  Did she know the guy, or was it just...  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  It was just, you know, I lived in the Lower East Side, and, you know, it's funny, because 
[01:04:30]  even, like, two years ago, the Lower East Side's changed a lot in the last two years.  I mean, it's, like, there's still some pretty crappy parts on there.  Was there any point where you were chasing him, or you were involved with this, and you  were like, what am I doing?  No, but the funniest thing was that, like, I'm so, you know, I'm, like, really thin,  and I was wearing, like, you know, just my underwear and nothing else, and had a metal  bar, and I was, like, running down First Avenue, and it was kind of raining, and I  saw my friend walking his dog, and he thought I was having some sort of PCP flip-flip out. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, you see that.  I was like, God, it's really hard to help, you know, like, I'm just gonna, Chris, I'm  gonna take a nap right here, you know.  I was like, what's going on?  I was like, come on, help me, dude.  So that was really fun.  Did he help you?  Yeah.  No, I mean, he didn't help me, like, beat this dude down, but I think he, like, called  the cops, and, yeah.  So basically, he did nothing.  He ran to a pay phone.  Yeah, yeah.  When you see your friend running with a metal bar in his underpants, and he says, help me,  you'd probably, I'll call somebody and let them help you. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  I'll call Bellevue.  Yeah.  How many, uh...  Get that Thor zine for you, buddy.  How many episodes total are there, uh, Generation Kill?  Seven.  Seven total?  Mm-hmm.  That's it?  That's it.  Damn it.  They don't get greedy, HBO.  They really don't.  When they do that, though.  And there's no second season?  No.  You're really only doing one season?  I mean, it's just the book.  It's the book.  It's the book.  It's going to be all wrapped up in seven episodes.  Write another book.  Yeah, no kidding.  Damn it.  I did not realize that.  It looks like something that could be a couple seasons easy. 
[01:06:00]  It said miniseries, so you're kind of like, eh.  It's like after MASH.  That's pretty much the tip-off when they, like, miniseries.  It's not miniseries.  Did you, uh, did you see Band of Brothers?  Did you watch that, World War II?  I never saw it.  Didn't see it?  Nope.  Yeah.  I haven't seen all of it.  I've seen.  Yeah, I thought that was, you know, pretty.  It's odd when you look at war over the years like that, because that seemed to me, too,  from, you know, what I've heard and read and seen in documentaries, to be a pretty accurate  depiction of World War II. 
[01:06:30]  And it's so starkly different from what's going on in Generation Kill, which, again, seems  pretty accurate.  And it just, it's such an odd thing to see how war and people that have gone to war have  changed over the years and become, I guess, a little more cynical.  Um, the advent of, of video cameras is another thing, uh, that the soldiers have that is  very surprising to see such, just heinous things being videotaped by these guys.  That legless girl scene was just horrific. 
[01:07:00]  Uh, but, um, have you, have you seen, uh, videos from some of the soldiers?  Have you had to check those out?  Uh, I've seen some photographs.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Pretty nasty stuff, or, uh, I, I can't look at that.  Yeah, it's, porn for me, it's great.  Yeah.  I'll look at any type of disgusting porn.  Two Girls, One Cup?  Uh-huh.  I know.  Privy?  Privy to that one?  You know what's weird is, I've never seen that one, and I won't see it.  Oh.  I, I have heard about it.  I directed that.  I completely misunderstood what I said.  I, I looked for it, because I had heard about it, but, like, you've got to join something? 
[01:07:30]  No.  Oh, our guys are just, oh, they could get it.  Hang out during the break, you'll see Two Girls, One Cup.  It's one of our favorite things to show people.  Here comes Danny running in, like, oh, I know where we're going to be.  There it is.  And, PJ, you should take a look at it, because it's, it's hilarious.  It's so hard to watch.  Yeah.  It's so hard to watch.  Yeah.  But you've, you've seen that, and it's odd to go onto some of the video sites and see  in the middle of combat.  Yeah.  You're watching guys behind a wall shooting, and this isn't a movie, it's, you know, this 
[01:08:00]  is real guys, and it kind of does bring the war home in such a different way than  it used to with the news, you know?  I know.  I mean, and then the, and then you, you know, and then you sort of juxtapose that against  the fact that, you know, the press isn't allowed to take, to take photos of, you know,  of the, of the coffins and stuff.  Yeah.  So, it's so weird.  It's like, we can't show this, but you go right onto YouTube, you know, you'll see them.  Absolutely.  Do you have a personal opinion of the war, and did it change at all after doing the show? 
[01:08:30]  Um, I mean, I'm, I, look, I've said this before, I've said it a couple of times, the  only, the only, I'm not against, I'm, I'm, you know, I'm, I'm not really for this war,  but only because I, I feel like we have so many things in this country that we sort of  need to get, uh, you know, we need to take care of, but at the other, you know, at the  other end of the spectrum, like, it's such, like, a gigantic, like, nuanced problem where  it's like, we shouldn't go in there for oil, and, you know, it's like, uh, well, it's more 
[01:09:00]  complicated than that, and if you really believe that, then, you know, throw away your iPod,  you know, it's, you know, like oil, wait a minute, you know how much oil it takes to  make an iPod?  Not, look, I'm not, I'm not saying, look, I'm not saying that, that it's a, that I'm morally  with it, or morally, like, you know, like, I'm totally morally opposed to invading somebody  else's country, but, uh, I don't know, I don't want to get into this.  Well, it's too late, you got into it, you got into it, and all of a sudden  I'm giving up my iPod.  No, iPods for oil, man. 
[01:09:30]  I'm just saying, you know, like, we, you know, like, we live in a, you know, we live  in a society that, that is, you know, you know, like, we live in a really imperialist  country, you know, it's like part of the game that we have to, you know, we have to, like,  that's what we're doing, and I'm, I'm opposed to it, but, you know, it's the way, it's the  way it goes.  I'm just kind of, uh, I'm still annoyed that we were a little, a little bamboozled into  jumping in there, you know.  Oh, yes, absolutely.  The original thing, if it, the original thing seemed a little noble, you know, this guy's 
[01:10:00]  got his weapons, whatever, we got to go in there and make sure he doesn't use them.  Then you find out there's no weapons, and then it's like, well, this kind of changed,  now we want to free him.  It's like, well, I wasn't up for that.  Yeah.  You know, I don't think a lot of the people were up for that.  If people want to be free, usually in this world, when people are oppressed and want  to be free, they rise up when the time is right and decide that they want to do it.  It's kind of hard to force people into, um, freedom.  It's very, I don't think we'll ever know why, you know, why we're over there.  Yeah.  There's, somebody has some reason, and I don't, you know. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  And after 9-11, we were all pretty gung-ho about just bombing the crap out of anybody.  You know, it was like, Afghanistan, all right, that's over.  No, we need something new.  Please, bomb something.  Yeah.  England, anything.  Yes.  I love the idea.  You're going to be a democracy.  You're going to do it.  Yeah.  Like, all right, all right, okay, we will do it.  Oh, yeah.  And you're going to choose.  You're going to love it.  And you're going to love the choice between two things.  Oh, my God.  You're going to choose.  No, you're going to choose. 
[01:11:00]  The choice.  Oh, okay.  We really have to take a break, but we want to show these guys two girls, one car.  Oh, dude, I don't know about this, dude.  Oh, no, don't do this to me, please, God.  You can turn away when you want.  Yes, turn away when you feel you should turn away.  Do I have to get closer to this?  Yeah, get over there.  There's a mic over there.  Yeah.  You know, there's a lot of goodness that you got.  Let her rip, Dan.  Lee, I can see it from here, Lee.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  All right, here we go.  Now, it starts out like any old.  This is two girls, one kind of. 
[01:11:30]  Two girls going at it.  And then it just instantly takes a turn for the worse.  We're going to do it together.  I'm going to say, what?  Oh!  Oh, my.  Yes.  Oh, my goodness gracious, no.  No.  Come on.  I don't buy it.  No, you don't want to buy it.  Come on.  It's pretty much what it is.  Oh, my God.  The people in the control room are frightened.  I wonder why we don't get more guests.  I'll tell you what that is.  It's peanut butter, liverwurst, and chocolate syrup, because that's what we used on the first 
[01:12:00]  season of Oz, and I did that on Schillinger.  Right.  Right on a Schillinger's face.  That's right.  Peanut butter.  Well, how do you explain that, then?  How do you explain that?  Wow.  It's good CGI, huh?  Looks like vomit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Explain that there.  Come on.  Mr. Hollywood.  This is...  What?  That's what our boys are fighting for.  The freedom to show that in Iraq.  That's right.  I don't even have, like, oh, my God, I'm about to, like... 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  They're nothing.  It is...  They're pros, sir.  They're pros.  They're pros.  Yeah.  That's a non-union production.  Not in union.  They're scabs.  It's disgusting.  If that's real, that's...  That's twisted.  I know.  I want to meet one of those girls.  You know, there's a whole thing on YouTube and other video sites of just people's reactions  to watching that.  It's hysterical.  You'll see just, like, oh, no, God.  Well, we got to thank these guys for coming in.  We got to...  Absolutely.  ...make a break. 
[01:13:00]  Generation Kill, right, Ant?  Yep.  Fantastic show.  HBO.  When is it?  Sundays at...  Nine.  Nine o'clock.  And then On Demand, anytime you want.  You can catch up.  I like that.  I like doing that.  You know, you have the film festival.  How many episodes in are you guys right now?  Because I haven't...  Four.  So if you want to go, you can watch it On Demand and catch...  It'll be caught up by the end.  Oh, yeah.  That's what I love about On Demand.  You don't just have to jump in and go, what's happening?  Right.  You know, you sit there for hours on end, having to go to the bathroom, laying in bed, just  go, one more, one more episode. 
[01:13:30]  I actually think I saw the entire Sopranos that way.  Yeah.  It's really weird.  Yeah.  I was like, oh, get this show.  And then I was in my house for 48 hours.  Like, oh, yeah.  Did the whole thing.  Like, fuck it.  Screw it.  That's what it is about.  Like, the box sets and On Demand, you just sit there and go, all right, one more.  One more.  I did that with Lost.  You know, the first season of Lost because second season came on and I was like, you  know, I didn't see this.  I'm lost.  I'm really lost.  So let me catch up.  And you're just sitting there with bags under your eyes.  You haven't showered. 
[01:14:00]  You're just a mess.  But caught up.  There you go.  Thanks, HBO.  I got it done.  I needed to do it.  Now I'm off the date.  All right.  Let's hear it for PJ and Lee.  Yeah, guys.  Thanks, man.  Thank you for coming in.  And continued success.  Once again, Generation Kill Sunday at 9 on HBO.  We'll continue in just a bit.  That was fun.  Yeah, that was great.  PJ and Lee from Generation Kill.  What a fun guy, man.  PJ played Ziggy on The Wire season two.  And Lee played Beecher on Oz. 
[01:14:30]  Beecher on Oz.  Yeah, those guys, it's so funny how they just kind of wander around from HBO show to HBO show.  HBO picks great actors.  They're not just good.  Yeah, yeah.  And they stick with the good ones.  I told Pete...  Oh, good.  No, go ahead, Jimmy.  I said, PJ, when you see him in The Wire, the way he screws up things that his cousin,  you want to strangle him.  Like, he's so good.  It's like any time an actor can pull that, like, type of...  He plays such a dick.  He pulls it out of you.  But you've got to love him.  It's just great, man. 
[01:15:00]  Absolutely.  We couldn't get to the phones during that last segment, but just a couple.  Matt from the Bronx, former Marine.  You guys are great.  I'm not sure if he's talking about the radio show or the guys from Generation Kill.  Yeah, right?  Hopefully it's both.  And then you've got Amy from New York.  She wanted to say that her husband was just deployed, and she loves Generation Kill.  Good.  Yeah.  We couldn't get to those two people.  I hope there's no salty language in this show.  Oh, well, it does get a little blue.  I don't go for that.  I'm so psyched, too. 
[01:15:30]  I'm holding my hand, episode five, six, and seven.  I hope there's something like that.  So, tonight, it's film festival time for all of you.  Nice.  Hope your DVD player, like, in the middle of it cracks.  No!  Yes!  Take it back.  Cracks.  How old am I?  Hope your DVD player cracks.  Cracks.  What an ass.  Those guys just cut IDs, and this is something I noticed, too.  And I'm trying to figure out who came up with the font first, but, wait, wait.  Lee, remember Jim had something from HBO?  Yeah.  He didn't remember, and he goes, he was on HBO, wasn't he? 
[01:16:00]  And I said, yeah, he had a couple specials and did a show, Lucky Louie.  Oh, right.  And he goes, oh, okay.  And then they saw the K-Rock sign and went off about how K-Rock stole the font from their show.  It really is the same, yeah.  We should throw it up on onaradio.com, yeah, our flagship station here in New York is using  the same font that Generation Kill does, so that'll be a quickie for O and A Radio.  I don't think K-Rock stole it, though, because I think K-Rock had the font first.  I think they did, actually. 
[01:16:30]  What?  Right?  Oh, yeah.  It's one of those things you go to an agency, and they're like, hey, here's a font you could  use.  How long was this show in production, though?  Ah, very good.  Oh, I'll have to check now.  It looks like it was, you know, it took a while to film.  We got Danny McBride from Tropic Thunder coming in, in a few minutes, and hopefully  Patrice will call, because he'd love the movie as well.  But first, Danny cut up a story, man murdered over beer.  He said, do not listen to this audio ahead of time.  He said, trust me on this.  So, we're going to trust him and see what this is all about. 
[01:17:00]  Okay?  Right.  Man murdered over beer.  To another shooting, this time at a home in South Memphis.  Police say a man was murdered behind a house at Trigg in South Lauderdale.  Action News 5's Janice Broach was the first television reporter on the scene.  She talked to witnesses who say the shooting may have started with an argument over beer.  Police say someone shot the man several times in broad daylight.  Susan Jones says the victim and another man were arguing over a beer. 
[01:17:30]  They was arguing over a beer.  They was up there.  They had a beer.  They didn't have no beer.  Oh.  And they wanted a beer.  They were hanging around to get a beer.  Because the mailman gave me a dog.  I was just talking about it.  They were arguing over a beer.  They probably took his beer and then shot him.  Ha, ha, ha.  Something about a beer.  You had a beer.  You went to the store and got a beer.  Right.  Right.  Right beer.  Right beer.  A beer?  A beer.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, wow.  We got another one of these.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  Several witnesses I talked with said they heard one gunshot, but police say the victim was  shot several times.  Jones says the victim comes in the area a lot and seems to be a nice guy.  She says she did not see who shot the man.  One woman told me the victim goes by the nickname Hot Rod, and he has a wife and children.  Investigators are hoping witnesses will come forward and let them know what happened.  Why is the reporter talking when you get more audio of that lady? 
[01:18:30]  That lady should be on the whole time.  Of course.  Burr.  He wanted a burr.  Someone got a burr.  They should ask her to talk about other stories that she had nothing to do with.  Right.  What's your favorite burr?  Where's that guy where he asked the name Beers and he ran out of beers?  After one.  After one.  And the guy goes, boo.  Moo.  Moo.  I drink good. 
[01:19:00]  Moo.  Moo.  I forgot about that one.  What was that story again?  They were trying to ban beer or something?  They wanted to raise the alcohol in, uh, and there was like a legislature somewhere in  Alabama, Arkansas, and they wanted to raise the, uh, alcohol content of a beer.  Of burr.  And, uh, they was going to say, we got beer here, it's going to drink good.  And he tried to name, we got a Budweiser, and he couldn't name the other ones.  He went, ah, and his friend went, moo.  Moo.  It was the worst exchange between two adults I'd ever heard.  And the guy's a politician or something, right?  Yeah, he's an assemblyman or something. 
[01:19:30]  Assemblyman?  What do you got, uh, Representative Alan Holmes of Alabama.  If you just, if you repeat what Jimmy just said, I, you, you really need to go home.  I was pulling the audio up.  Well, do you, what, what, what, what he was.  Jimmy explained the clip, so you have the clip.  Yeah, I have it right now.  All right, here's the clip.  Yeah, what's wrong with the beer we got?  I mean, the beer we got drank pretty good, don't it?  I ain't never heard nobody complain about the, uh, beer we have.  It drank pretty good.  Budweiser.  Uh, what's the name of some of them other beers? 
[01:20:00]  Budweiser and what is it?  Moo.  Moo.  It drank pretty good, don't it?  I love that guy.  Moo.  Moo.  There's so much going on with that clip, the, the one guy.  It drank pretty good.  You can't name another beer after Budweiser.  Budweiser, what's that other name?  Another one?  Budweiser, they must be going, see, our advertising works.  Moo.  It's the only beer this guy can name.  Moo.  Moo.  It's not like a guy on a video and his deaf friend. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Disgusting alcohol.  And then the, it drinks pretty good.  It drank pretty good.  Can we hear that again?  I love it.  The beer we got.  I mean, the beer we got drank pretty good, don't it?  I ain't never heard nobody complain about the beer we have.  It drank pretty good.  Budweiser.  What's the name of some of them other beers?  Budweiser and what is it?  Moo.  Moo.  Coors. 
[01:21:00]  Coors.  Coors.  It drank pretty good.  Moo.  Coors.  I forgot he got Coors in there, too.  And now we got the new clip with this lady talking about beer.  To another shooting, this time at a home in South Memphis.  Police say a man was murdered behind a house at Trigg and South Lauderdale.  Action News 5's Janice Broach was the first television reporter on the scene.  She talked to witnesses who say the shooting may have started with an argument over beer.  Police say someone shot the man several times in broad daylight. 
[01:21:30]  Susan Jones says the victim and another man were arguing over a beer.  They were arguing over a beer.  They was up there.  They had a beer.  They didn't have no beer.  Oh.  And they wanted a beer.  They were hanging around to get a beer.  The mailman gave me a dollar.  They were arguing over a beer.  They probably took his beer and then shot him.  All right, listen.  She talks for 15 seconds.  Yeah.  She said beer.  Or burr.  Burr.  Seven times.  Seven times.  Seven times.  Burr.  Burr.  That's a great clip. 
[01:22:00]  Good find from Danny today.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Hey, we got this lady.  She's been on hold for like an hour, I think.  Trixie, what's up?  Hey, Trixie.  Trixie.  Save this.  We want to play that again.  Trixie, you still there?  Yeah.  What's going on, man?  Hey, what's going on?  Yeah, I'm kind of fucked up here.  But, um...  Oh, well, you certainly are.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  You certainly are.  We're using that type of potty mouth.  Slow down.  We got Trixie on the phone and she's effed up.  She had to tell us that. 
[01:22:30]  And, uh, what do you want from us today there, Trixie?  I want to do Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  We haven't done Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday in a while.  Maybe, maybe you bring the bit back today.  Well, how do you want to wake up your spouse?  Um, I'm going to serve them with divorce papers.  Oh, good.  All right.  Let's hear that.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  What?  What?  Why are you divorcing them, Trixie?  Uh, I don't know.  Just, um, things haven't been working out too well for a long time. 
[01:23:00]  And, uh, I don't know.  I have a boyfriend and so he has no idea it's coming.  I met up all night, like, doing a lot of drugs.  But, uh, I think it's really funny.  Where is he right now, your husband?  He's upstairs sleeping.  But who's coming?  You said, uh-oh, he's coming.  I said that?  Yeah.  Uh, I don't know.  Were you drinking all night?  Uh, no, I wasn't drinking. 
[01:23:30]  Were you with your boyfriend last night?  Drugs.  Huh?  Yeah.  You were with your boyfriend?  And with my boyfriend.  Cool.  Did she just say drunk or drugs?  You said she...  What?  Ex.  Ex.  Oh, okay.  So you were doing a little of that drugging with your, uh, new boyfriend.  And, uh, and your husband's upstairs.  He has no clue.  And now you want to wake him up with divorce papers.  Do you have actual divorce papers?  Or are you just going to tell him you want to divorce?  I do.  I've been planning this for a couple weeks and, uh, just no fucking idea. 
[01:24:00]  You are a potty mouse.  That's all right.  She's on ecstasy and she's going to divorce a guy on the radio.  She said the F-bomb.  She said that, uh, he has no effing idea.  Okay, so I think we should...  All right, guys.  Yeah.  He's been on the show, too.  Okay.  All right.  Walking up the steps.  All right.  Trixie's walking up the steps with divorce papers.  I'm skeptical. 
[01:24:30]  I'm a bit, too.  Hey, Tom.  Tom.  Tom, wake up.  Tom, wake up.  Hey, Tom.  Wake up.  Come on.  Wake up, sweetie.  What?  Wake up.  Here you go.  You're the shit.  What the fuck are you doing?  What?  What the fuck are you doing? 
[01:25:00]  Fucking read this.  Look, look.  Look.  What's wrong?  What do you mean that's wrong with me?  You fucked up.  That's what's wrong with me.  Wake up.  What the fucking high?  Look at your high.  We're going to run out of dump.  We're just going to run out of dump.  There's a lot of cursing going on.  Hold on.  I'll just pot them down.  There's a lot of cursing going on.  Are we still recording that?  I...  I...  It's like Christmas Wednesday. 
[01:25:30]  Anything?  That's Ope?  What?  That's Ope on the phone?  Yeah.  What the fuck is...  They're just cursing.  Yeah, you can't...  Crazy.  It's not even one of those gray areas.  Right, right.  They're just dropping F-bombs left and right.  We can't go back to that.  It's too...  Come on, guys.  They're just going to keep cursing.  I know.  It's gone.  Miss?  Well, it's a wonderful way to wake up your spouse, but she's cursing. 
[01:26:00]  He's cursing.  What are you effing high?  What the F are you doing?  You effed up.  Yeah.  That's a lot of the stuff you missed there in this phone call.  Are we still on?  Yeah, but you can't curse, sweetheart.  Okay.  No cursing.  I won't...  Are you awake now?  What do you think?  I can't even read this.  What is it?  Divorce, bitches.  Bitches.  Should we just bail? 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, I'm not.  It's so frustrating.  First of all, I'm not buying it.  Right, right. 
[01:27:00]  You know, worth a try, but...  She's back on hold.  On hold.  I love the listeners that wait an hour thinking they got something good, and then it's just  a disaster.  It's awful.  First of all, yeah, they're just cursing like crazy, and then, ah, I didn't buy his reaction.  I feel sick to my stomach.  Oh, he said that?  Yeah.  They're like a couple of...  Rachel, I feel sick to my stomach. 
[01:27:30]  No Academy Awards there.  Ah, we took a chance.  I think we failed miserably.  Who knows?  Maybe it's real.  I don't even know.  The potty mouths.  Maybe the guy will call us back, and if it is fake, hopefully it will do the right thing  and at least tell us that.  Yeah, I think it was.  You think?  Mm-hmm.  I ain't buying a...  Trixie.  Trixie, you still there?  Yeah.  Are you guys just messing with us?  We need to know.  Uh-uh.  You, like, set that up and... 
[01:28:00]  Heronkis.  Yeah, she just heronkissed.  Are you...  Was that a setup?  Yes.  Trixie.  All right.  Trixie, you really messed up our show.  Kind of not.  Like, I really am getting divorced, but we've definitely been eating X all night long.  All right.  Thanks, Trixie.  Thanks for whatever you were attempting to do today.  I still like her.  Who knows?  She's got a potty mouth, and she does ecstasy. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  All right.  I wouldn't mind banging Trixie.  We've had a pretty good show so far, and then that.  877-212-ONE.  Greyhound pulls bus rage ads.  Did you hear about this one?  No.  Now, you got the guy, Patrice calls him the giant Asian or whatever, because he was over  six foot, and he was the Asian dude that beheaded the fellow passenger that he didn't really  know.  And then the eyewitness report is just unbelievable.  Then he started eating the flesh...  Love this guy.  ...off the guy.  And then the latest news is they found, like, I think an ear and a nose and something, and 
[01:29:00]  a piece of his mouth or something.  Yeah, they found a bag in his pocket with an ear, the nose, and a piece of the guy's mouth.  Of the guy, though?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess he was saving that for later, because, you know, it's a long ride.  Yeah, you need snacks on the buses.  Sure.  Well, the latest, Greyhound Canada said Tuesday that it is in the process of pulling a series  of ads in an extensive cross-country campaign featuring the slogan.  They came up with this slogan thinking, all right, this is going to get people riding  the bus more.  There's a reason you've never...  There's a reason, excuse me, you've never heard of bus rage. 
[01:29:30]  Oops.  Oops.  Well, that still covers it, though.  Yeah.  Maybe they should start serving meals.  Poor guy was hungry.  He certainly was.  Yeah, you don't hear a bus rage, but when it does happen, wow.  Wow.  It's a good one.  Look out.  Nose in a baggie.  As long as it's not you, you've got a story to tell, you know?  I wouldn't mind being on that bus.  Really?  Yeah, as long as it wasn't me.  You know what, though?  So, here's you waking up every night. 
[01:30:00]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  You're just seeing that severed head every night in your dreams.  Yeah.  The second you shut your eyes, you're seeing that murderer holding that head.  Yeah.  Eating the flesh from it.  And then you've got a spokesperson.  We just felt, in light of the recent incident, it could be a very offensive message, and  we didn't think it was appropriate for it to be run any longer.  Hmm.  How about you rarely hear about bus rage? 
[01:30:30]  Right.  Can you just change that word?  Yeah, just, uh, yeah, because they got all the posters and the billboards made, right?  Yeah, you rarely, you usually don't hear.  The ad was saying you don't have to be behind the wheel.  You don't have to be in the traffic.  You could sit back and let someone else do the driving for you.  Let someone else do the stabbing.  It was aimed at potential and current greyhound ridership.  We don't think it's an appropriate slogan anymore, and that is why we've chosen to remove it.  How about, uh...  That is horrible timing, huh?  Like the gentleman's head.  Yeah.  I got a new slogan for them. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  What's one beheading?  Yeah.  And they ought to calculate all their miles.  Three million miles, one lost head.  Not bad, huh?  Yeah.  That would be good.  I mean...  They have a great mileage to beheading ratio.  That's a good safety record when it comes to beheadings and bus driving.  One beheading.  That's only one more than all the airlines have had.  I think we've all been on a greyhound bus over the years, and it's been my experience.  I think I could say that I'm surprised there hasn't been a lot more beheadings with the 
[01:31:30]  type of clientele that likes to ride some of these buses.  Yeah.  You know?  I mean, not exactly your upper echelon riding the bus.  That certainly has been my observation over the years.  When I took the bus from California to New York, there was a male prostitute, female prostitute,  an ouzo bum, and various people going from city to city, like homeless people, that just 
[01:32:00]  decided they were moving.  So they'd just take their stinky clothes, get on the bus, and get off somewhere else,  and now they're homeless in that city.  And you know, there's a guy that was on that bus with you?  Yeah.  He was doing a radio show somewhere going, and two hooligans.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, two young, molestable children.  Yeah.  Two male prostitutes.  That's pretty much it.  Yeah.  Dad threw you on a cross-country grave.  Yeah, that was the time that Mom sent us out money for plane fare, and Dad took the, or 
[01:32:30]  sent us tickets.  Yeah.  And Dad cashed in the tickets, took the money, and bought us two bus tickets.  Yeah.  Much to Mom's chagrin.  What did he do with the money?  Probably invested it?  Yeah.  Invested it in Budweiser.  And more, more.  Oh, God.  Cool.  Three days instead of five hours.  Oh, my God.  It was longer than three days.  Yeah, that bus stopped a lot.  And, yeah, it stopped everywhere. 
[01:33:00]  All these cities.  It took about five days to get across.  And he gave us, I think, $100 for the two of us.  So that was all we had, which, when we hit Vegas, we tried to make more money out of it  in the slot machines, and pretty much lost it all.  So we had no money from Vegas to New York.  How'd you eat?  Stealing stuff from various people asleep on the bus, including the Uzo bum.  We drank his Uzo.  And then one of the female prostitutes was pretty cool. 
[01:33:30]  So she kind of, you know, hooked us up.  Wow.  You should write a book.  And then my brother had some tie stick in his bags.  And we got arrested right when we walked off the bus.  The cop came up and goes, you two, come with me.  And then it was cool because the chick that was kind of with us, she held Joe's bag, the  one with the, held Joe's bag, the one with the tie stick in it.  So we didn't have to bring that to the cops. 
[01:34:00]  And you got arrested because your mom was wondering where the hell you guys were.  No, no, because we were just minors kind of getting off the bus in New York City.  They thought maybe we were here to, you know, get into the hustling business.  I thought I was going to be a hustler.  A young hustler.  I could have made some bucks back then, let me tell you.  That's hilarious.  A supple, hairless bottom.  Cried a lot.  That would tap into so many dominions.  Oh, my God.  They would just love to watch me cry.  All right, listen, that's what we do now because of Trixie. 
[01:34:30]  We attempted to save this segment.  I want to thank Trixie for completely derailing the show with your shenanigans.  Ah, screw her.  With your Bravo Sierra.  But that's what we did.  I think we saved this segment.  Certainly did.  We got Danny McBride coming in.  Who, you might ask?  Well, this guy is blowing up in front of our eyes.  He was in Foot Fist Way.  He's in Tropic Thunder.  And I believe he's in Pineapple Express as well.  Yes, sir.  Yes, Seth Rogen's latest movie that's getting very good reviews, 
[01:35:00]  except for one dumb paper here in New York.  Everyone else likes the movie except this dumb paper in New York City.  Giving actually a better review to the sisterhood of the traveling pants  too.  That's getting a better review in this dumb paper than Pineapple Express.  Making me want to see it.  Yeah.  That's for sure.  So we'll talk to Danny McBride next.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:35:30]  Getting ready for Danny McBride.  Is he here?  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  Are we getting...  All right.  We went and saw Tropic Thunder yesterday after the radio show.  A couple of us anyway.  And we all love the movie and this Danny McBride.  He's blown up right in front of our eyes.  He was really, really good in the movie.  And we're trying to get...  Oh, here's Patrice as we get Danny McBride in studio. 
[01:36:00]  Hey, Patrice.  Good morning, sir.  How much fun did we have at the movie theater yesterday?  It was...  It was really...  It was beautiful, man.  I'm beautiful.  It was just five guys.  Me, Ope, Stunt Brain, Bobby, and some magic.  The dude that looked like a magician.  I don't even know who he was.  That was Roland's friend.  Who's going to make us all jeans, I guess.  He was in Project Runway or something.  And Roland's like, he's not gay.  He's not gay.  I'm like, whatever. 
[01:36:30]  Because Roland's panicking that he's walking around with a guy from Project Runway.  I guess he's a friend of his.  I'm like, all right.  The guy wants to make you jeans and he's not gay.  If that didn't solidify Roland's gayness, the guy looked like Merlin in jeans.  Merlin, a magician without his hat.  He looks like he has a little magic in him.  That's for sure.  Oh, Jesus.  He was the most beautiful man I've ever seen in my life.  Yeah.  We all was in the theater, dude.  I'm not going to lie to you. 
[01:37:00]  That movie...  We'll put you right over here.  I don't know if Robert Downey Jr., if you can get an Oscar nomination for the kind of  role he did, but that dude was amazing.  Yeah.  Robert Downey Jr. playing the black guy in Tropic Thunder.  Oh, my God.  It had Patrice rolling.  There was things in the movie.  I'm not going to lie, dude.  It's a comedy that didn't let me down one time.  Yeah.  Every single time it was supposed to do something, it did it. 
[01:37:30]  And the biggest thing is that it attacked every group.  You know, retarded people, Asians, drug addicts, black people.  Who else?  They attacked somebody else in there.  But all the stuff they attacked, the one role, man, that Tom Cruise played.  If the movie continues to actually play...  No one knows that Tom Cruise is in this movie. 
[01:38:00]  Well, now they know.  And I wish we were filming Patrice's rant on the sidewalk after the movie, because it would  be a great extra on the DVD.  He couldn't believe what Tom Cruise was doing with that character, basically just making  fun of Jews.  Right there, Patrice.  Making fun of Jews?  If Jews don't shut down Tropic Thunder after it opens, I'll be surprised. 
[01:38:30]  I'll be disappointed in what I think Jews are.  Dude, I'm serious, dude.  I can't believe that I saw that movie, dude.  Yeah.  I'm so happy I saw that movie.  I'm not going to lie to you, man.  It was not...  It wasn't one weak moment in the movie, man.  Simple Jack.  When Simple Jack comes on, the fake movie trailer within the movie, whatever, Ben Stiller  plays this character called Simple Jack.  We couldn't breathe.  We were laughing so hard. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, dude, I can't...  If the movie is on...  I'm serious, man.  I've never...  There might have been a...  Maybe 48 hours I wanted to see twice.  Yeah.  You know, this movie, I'm telling you, I don't know how long it takes for movies to be decided  to be a classic or something.  But this movie, it didn't disappoint me one single time, dude.  And it was an hour and 90 minutes, what it was supposed to be. 
[01:39:30]  The movie is tremendous, man.  And I'm, you know, I'm kind of like not a super, super Ben Stiller dude, but I'm done now.  Like, I'm a Ben Stiller guy now.  Like, that man, he directed it and all that.  I couldn't believe that movie, man.  Yeah.  And Tom Cruise...  I'm telling you.  Tom Cruise...  Describe...  ...doing this guy.  Yeah, describe what he looked like, Tom Cruise.  It's...  He was a swollen, hairy, controlling-the-earth Jew. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, God.  But he wasn't.  It was so racist.  They couldn't make...  Let me tell you something.  They couldn't make a silent 1901 German-style portrayal of a Jew.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, they even had...  That sounds great.  Tom Cruise even had, like, psoriasis on his hands. 
[01:40:30]  He had, like, dry skin.  He had the, uh, what's the...  The huge arms.  The huge arms and...  These big arms.  He's bald.  He's got the gold chain.  A gold chain with a money sign on it.  Yeah.  And he just does things, dude.  It's so...  It's so subtle and wrong and inside.  But the...  But it's not...  It's just... 
[01:41:00]  It's nasty, but it's hilarious.  But it's...  I can't...  I couldn't believe I watched it.  It was shocked.  That movie shocked me, man.  Yeah, it was great.  We got Danny McBride in studio, by the way, Patrice.  Oh, man.  He played the special effects guy in, uh, Tropic Thunder.  Dude, you are...  You guys are in a hit movie.  Even if it gets taken out of the theaters, it'll be...  It'll be genius on the underground after...  After the Jews get rid of this movie. 
[01:41:30]  Because here's the slick thing they did.  They were so horrible to every group across the board.  Every single...  Oh, amputees get it, dude.  Like, every group is touched in this movie.  But the one thing they...  It was all a ploy to disguise what Tom Cruise did.  At the end, when I figured out what was going on, 
[01:42:00]  it was shockingly...  I'm so happy I saw that movie, dude.  It was an unbelievable movie, man.  These dudes are all gonna be, like, in movies now.  It's gonna be, like...  It's like...  It's like the death of Judd Apatow's movies.  And now it's...  Whatever this movie is, it's...  It's super bad, too.  Might as well...  They might as well stop filming it.  Unbelievable.  I'm telling you, man.  I'm looking at a photo of the Tom Cruise.  He's, like, in the prosthetic with the hairy chest 
[01:42:30]  and part of the fat stomach, but he looks awful.  Yeah.  He looks...  But look at...  Jimmy.  When you see the movie, dude,  you don't...  It's almost like you...  At the end, you go,  Oh, my God.  No, no, no.  I mean awful in, like,  he just looks like a fat pig of a guy.  Not the makeup is awful,  but he just looks like a disaster of a human.  No, no, right.  No, like, he just looks like some fat...  But, dude, the makeup...  Everything is a ploy  to throw off what they're doing. 
[01:43:00]  I can't believe they did it.  And somebody said,  Cool.  Somebody gave the gold.  Oh, it was great, man.  You guys see, I'm telling you,  that movie,  other than, let me see,  Iron Man  and even The Dark Knight,  which I recommend,  but this is the best thing I've seen.  Paul Sommer?  You're saying this is better than  The Dark Knight and Iron Man?  It's better...  It's not better than Iron Man. 
[01:43:30]  Uh-huh.  Iron Man was a great movie.  Dark Knight...  Dark Knight,  Heath Ledger's...  Let me tell you something.  Comedically,  Robert Downey Jr. was as good  as Heath Ledger was  a villain in Dark Knight.  Robert Downey Jr.,  you were laughing  when he was talking  to the real black guy in the film?  Dude, every moment...  When they were talking  about slavery and all?  Every moment...  Now, this is in the trailer,  so I'm not giving away anything  because it's in the trailer now,  but when he goes,  when Ben Stiller goes,  Hey, man, you people, 
[01:44:00]  and Robert Downey Jr. goes,  What you mean, you people?  Like,  he wasn't supposed to say that?  He said it?  Every single scene  that something was supposed  to happen funny,  the funny was there.  Yeah.  The exact thing that was supposed  to be funny was funny, dude.  I'm telling you, man.  And I hate movie comedies,  and this movie was tremendous.  But I don't know if...  I got to see it twice  just to make sure that  it wasn't just our moment together,  Opie. 
[01:44:30]  Everybody just kind of...  We lost it in the theater.  You know what sucks?  When you see a movie  like Tropic Thunder,  you really want to talk about  everything you saw,  and it's really hard right now  because we're holding back.  When does it start?  When does it come out?  Next week.  So, we should talk to  Danny McBride.  He's in studio.  He's, of course,  in Tropic Thunder.  He's also in Pineapple Express,  and you were saying,  you know,  Patrice,  you were just saying  some bad things  about his boss there,  but Danny McBride's  in two hit movies.  Two.  Why?  What other one is he in?  Pineapple Express 
[01:45:00]  that opens today?  Well,  he's destroying his own self.  I'm kicking my own ass.  Oh, yes, sir,  because when Pineapple Express,  I didn't see it,  but I mean,  look,  man,  and Pineapple Express  can even come close  to Tropic Thunder,  and if you're playing  a role that comes close  to the role,  you're playing  as the psychotic,  nervous mistake  with the burned-up ear  from the fact that  he's an awful  pyrotechnic guy.  They just show 
[01:45:30]  a burned-up ear  because he's back.  The movie,  your boy Ben Stiller  had an epiphany  when he made  this movie, man,  and it came through,  man,  I'm telling you.  Yeah,  it worked out nice.  It really did, man.  No lie.  Well,  you should wait  to declare  the best movie  of the summer  until you see  Sisterhood of the  Traveling Pants 2.  Oh, wow.  Yes.  We've been all over  that one, Danny.  It's going to be  neck and neck. 
[01:46:00]  We're amazed  after the first one  that they decided  to make a second one.  And they're giving  the movie good reviews.  It's obviously for chicks  because we're reading  the synopsis going,  who the F would  watch this crap?  It's for chicks  in jeans.  That's who it's about.  Yeah.  This should be on  the We Channel  as a premiere,  and that's it.  Yeah.  We want to do a spoof,  like get a pair  of sweaty sweatpants  and do like  the Brotherhood  of the Sweaty Sweatpants  or something.  Throw it up on YouTube  and become 
[01:46:30]  YouTube sensations.  Like swamp-ass pants.  Yeah, yeah, sure.  Well, fellas, look.  All right.  My man,  congratulations  for that movie, man.  Oh, thank you very much.  I'm glad you dug it.  No, dug it  is not the word, man.  It's just,  I mean,  either you're going  to be a celebrity  or all of you  are going to be  missing from Hollywood.  One time of a day, yeah.  I'm telling you,  this Danny McBride,  it's his turn there,  Patrice.  He's blowing up.  Yeah, I mean,  it's still, yeah,  he was,  the turbo pyrotechnic guy. 
[01:47:00]  It was not a,  look, man,  everybody in the movie  deserves, you know,  to be seen again.  The movie is one  of those movies.  I hope it just kind of,  you know.  I think it's going  to do very well.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, Patrice.  Hey, thanks, man.  See y'all.  All right.  Speaking of funny movies,  I got to give you props  for Foot Fist Way.  Oh, you guys are one  of the ten people  who saw that film.  Thank you.  Yeah, but that whole thing  was, that was a weird thing  for you because it was  an independent film?  Yeah, we made the movie  for literally like seven bucks  and it was just a bunch 
[01:47:30]  of friends and, yeah,  we shot it down  in North Carolina  and then it happened  to get into Sundance.  We're those assholes  who had a movie  made for nothing  that got into Sundance.  Which makes everyone  else very angry  in Hollywood  and all that, right?  Yeah.  And then somehow  Will Ferrell got word  of this movie  and distributed it for you.  Is that true?  Yeah, you know,  we were all stoked  because we got to Sundance.  We're thinking that it's made.  It's going to be limousines  and parties  and then we get to Sundance  and we get no deal,  no distribution deal. 
[01:48:00]  Nothing.  So we just leave Sundance  and go home empty-handed  and then unbeknownst to us,  the film was like  being passed around town  and we get a call  from our agent saying  that Will Ferrell saw it  and wanted to, you know,  help get it out in the theaters.  Can you imagine?  That's great.  Yeah, it's pretty nice.  You want to explain  Foot Fist Way?  I know you're here  for Tropic Thunder  but I got to give you  props on that movie.  I, yeah, I'm like,  I play like an egomaniac  taekwondo instructor  peddling like ancient wisdom  in a strip mall.  It's pretty awesome.  He's kind of like, 
[01:48:30]  he's kind of got  a little master pole in him.  Oh, right?  Oh, yeah.  And I'm going to be honest  with you,  Roland turned me on  to Foot Fist Way.  I went home like,  all right.  And I watched it.  I wasn't really sure  what to think.  I really wasn't.  And then,  but there was something  about the movie  and I had some friends over.  I'm like,  let's watch this Foot Fist Way.  And we watched it  a second time.  I laughed through  the entire movie.  It's your movie, basically.  That character you came up with  is very quotable  and very, very hilarious.  And then I'm like,  wow, this really is  a good movie.  Didn't do too well,  unfortunately.  But it's going to be 
[01:49:00]  on DVD, right?  It's going to be  on DVD.  Yeah, I don't really know  what the marketing campaign  was for that movie.  They held on to it  for like two years  and were literally like,  yeah, you know,  the fall's not a good time  to release comedies.  The spring's not a good time  to release comedies.  And you're kind of like,  what?  And my parents are like,  when's the film coming out?  And you find yourself  repeating the same things.  Well, mom,  the fall's not a good time  for comedies, mom.  Everybody knows this.  But your character,  I mean,  you're a lot thinner.  What,  did you shred it out  for the movie or something? 
[01:49:30]  Well, that's what I say.  Okay.  For the role.  And then he's got  kind of a flat top do  and the worst mustache  ever in movies.  It's terrible.  Just the most horrendous mustache.  And Rotten Tomatoes  gave it pretty good reviews,  58% positive reviews.  Oh, wow.  That's okay.  But, all right.  We're going to take  a quick break.  We've got Danny McBride  in studio.  We're going to talk about  Pineapple Express,  which is in theaters today.  We were supposed to see  that movie, Roland.  Yeah.  When are we seeing  Pineapple Express, my friend?  When?  When?  Roland. 
[01:50:00]  Because I was sleeping on...  What?  He's blaming it on me?  Yeah, he was sleeping.  What happened, Roland?  I saw it twice already.  I saw it.  No, but I invited you  but it was like  at 7.30 at night  and you were like,  ugh.  Yeah, it's a little late for us.  7.30 at night is late.  It was really good though.  I saw it twice already.  One last night again.  Yeah, we have  second grade bedtimes now.  Yeah.  Let me ask you.  Stupid morning radio.  Now, Danny's in both movies.  Which one's better?  Both of them are awesome.  The truth.  There you go.  There's two different types 
[01:50:30]  of movies though.  One's like a stoner type comedy.  The other one's about  like making a movie type comedy.  Always diplomatic.  It's very dramatic.  They both equally did.  Danny is awesome at Pineapple  and he's amazing  and tropic.  I counted the laughs.  They were the same.  Yeah.  What you're seeing right now  is a worm.  Yeah.  That's the answer  where you expected from him.  Yeah, I love them both.  From him.  Oh.  Well, you gotta say  one's better than the other though.  You just have to.  Not insulting.  I'll tell you one thing.  Patrice's review there,  first of all,  that should be on TV. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  On a movie review show.  And that sold me.  Yeah?  Right there.  Yeah.  Patrice's little review there  just sold me.  I gotta see that movie now.  You go see Pineapple today  and then go see Tropic next week.  You're not getting off that easy.  Pineapple is nuts.  It literally is.  I don't think there's been  two movies as badass  as that's coming out  within a week of each other.  It's a stoner action comedy.  Oh, really?  Yeah, with shootings,  stabbings.  Car chases.  Everything.  Explosions.  Slurpees.  Is Danny better  as his character 
[01:51:30]  in Tropic Thunder  or his character  in Pineapple Express?  Two different things.  Yeah, two different things.  Two different things.  I'm gonna use that  in everything.  He gets to Pineapple  Express, though.  Huh?  He's still Pineapple Express.  He's awesome.  Who stole Tropic Thunder?  I would say  I love Danny in Tropic Thunder.  Yeah.  Tom Cruise is really good.  You really need him  to just follow you around  all the time.  He can't commit to anything.  Yeah, I love the fifth way.  That's why he tried it. 
[01:52:00]  We were gonna see that  and you're like,  eh, I wouldn't waste my time.  No.  Roland did push that  a little bit.  Yeah, absolutely.  All right.  We'll take a break  and we'll continue  with Danny McBride.  Pineapple Express  in theaters today, right?  And then Tropic Thunder  next week?  Yep, next Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Open Wednesday.  Right.  You gotta see  when we tickle him, Danny.  Yeah, I bet you  it's just... 
[01:52:30]  Can you humor Danny  before break?  Yeah, yeah.  All right, watch.  This is real, by the way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What is that?  Creepies.  I know.  It's a grown man.  Oh, no.  Look at him.  He's just the worst.  All right.  We'll be back. 
[01:53:00]  Hi.  Okay.  Okay.  What is this?  We usually don't come back  with music like this,  but what the hell?  It's Opie and Anthony.  We got Danny McBride in studio.  How cool is it that you're here  to promote two big movies,  big summer movies?  It's not a bad place to be.  Yeah.  You're in Tropic Thunder  and Pineapple Express,  which opens today in theaters.  And Roland,  he doesn't want to commit  to which movie you're better in.  Better in pain,  it's equal but different.  Yeah.  We got Matt in New York.  Matt. 
[01:53:30]  Hey, Matt.  What's up?  Hey.  We got Danny in studio.  Hey, Danny.  Bros before hoes, man.  There you go, man.  So you've seen Pineapple, huh?  I did.  I saw it last night.  And like that, Roland says,  you absolutely steal the movie  every time you open your mouth.  I appreciate that.  It doesn't seem like  anything was written for you.  Like you guys just improv.  I wanted to know,  was it like that with Stiller  on Tropic Thunder?  Or was that just Judd's  kind of way of doing the set?  You know,  it seems like a lot of the comedies  I've worked on, 
[01:54:00]  that's kind of the route  everyone's going these days.  It's just kind of,  you know,  say what's on the script,  you know,  and then just kind of  riff from there.  But yeah,  Stiller definitely  encouraged improv on there,  which is pretty insane  when things are blowing up  next to you  and you're trying  to test out jokes.  Talking about,  of course,  the opening scene  of Tropic Thunder.  Yes.  When all hell breaks loose.  He's the special effects guy  that doesn't know  what the hell he's doing.  I gotta see this.  And they're trying to...  I don't know.  Even in Pineapple Express,  things are blowing up  around him all the time.  Oh, really? 
[01:54:30]  I get shot multiple times  in that film.  What's Pineapple Express  about,  the basic synopsis?  I think it's a brand new genre.  It's a buddy weed action film.  I don't think that's  really been done before.  Yeah,  it's just about two stoners  who kind of end up  in this extraordinary situation  where they witness a murder  and all these people  are after them.  And it's like the two,  you know,  most unlikely guys  to be involved  in running  or dodging death.  Just two lethargic potheads.  Nice.  And what's your role? 
[01:55:00]  I'm a drug dealer in it.  I'm red.  I'm James Franco's supplier.  Yeah.  So it wasn't a big stretch for me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, you like the weed?  I like the weed.  Most guys will not admit  they like the weed.  I like the weed.  I can't talk about that  on a radio show.  What's wrong with you?  Garrett on Long Island.  Garrett.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  I have a question for Danny.  Okay.  Now,  I saw Trap and Thunder  there a few weeks ago  and I thought it was hilarious. 
[01:55:30]  You guys did a great job  and you were hilarious, too.  But I'm going to see  Pineapple Express tonight  and I was wondering  which character  you actually enjoy playing more.  Uh-oh.  Now we go to Danny  with the question.  You know,  honestly,  both of them,  not to, you know,  not to ride the fence,  but, yeah,  I think you'll see,  like,  Red is just such a different dude.  I get my ass beat  in that movie a lot.  That was fun.  Tropic Thunder,  we're filming in Kauai,  so that wasn't too bad to do.  You know,  hang out with Nick Nolte  for a whole summer.  So what you're saying 
[01:56:00]  is both,  both roles are equally as good.  Hey,  when you met Nick Nolte,  did you ever see Q&A  with Nick Nolte?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You should have just done quotes.  Yeah,  from that whole entire time.  That's all I would have done  is racist quotes from Q&A to Nick.  I would have annoyed him so,  so much.  You want to jump over  your dying mother  to F your sister.  He's the greatest.  He's great in Tropic Thunder.  Is Nick Nolte?  Yeah.  Is he in it?  Yeah, he's in it.  He's the Vietnam vet.  And I want to, 
[01:56:30]  I'm holding back so badly.  But he's the Vietnam vet  in Tropic Thunder,  and he's really, really good.  He's insane, yeah.  How was it,  did you get to meet Tom Cruise,  or was it one of these films  where even though  you're in the film  with Tom Cruise,  his scenes were filmed  somewhere else  and you never saw the guy?  Well, basically,  I met him at the read-through  briefly,  and by met him,  I mean I saw him  across the table.  And no,  we, you know,  he filmed all his stuff  back in Los Angeles  and we were in Kauai  for all the,  you know,  for most of the film.  How do they do that? 
[01:57:00]  They shoot the one  and they mail it.  Oh.  There was lots of mailing  in this film.  Mail it.  So when he was at the table  of the read-through,  I mean, obviously,  he's like,  he's such a star.  I mean,  everybody is probably  like Tom Cruise in the room,  you know,  because he's famous.  Are you,  do you like want to go up  and say hello to him  or do you have people around  and the second the read is done  he's got people surrounding him?  It was, you know,  that read-through  with everyone who's in that film,  that read-through was like  pretty insane.  You're sitting there  and you're just kind of sweating  like,  I don't want to,  what am I doing here? 
[01:57:30]  They're going to,  I'm going to open my mouth  and I'm going to get canned  from the film.  Were you afraid of sucking  at the read-through?  I was totally afraid  of sucking at the read-through.  I'm not good at stuff like that.  They're going to know  I'm a fraud.  They're going to find me out here  and get singled out  in front of all these people  you admire.  Yeah.  Oh.  Who was at the table?  You had Ben Stiller,  of course.  Ben Stiller,  Jack Black,  Downey,  you had him there.  Cruz,  Nick Nolte.  Cruz was there,  Nick Nolte.  It was insane.  Yeah,  and then you have  like every single executive.  Pacino,  De Niro,  Scorsese.  And they were just  hanging out,  smoking weed, 
[01:58:00]  watching the read-through.  That is humiliating.  The worst is when you have  a joke line in a read-through  and it gets nothing  and you're like,  I suck,  I should be shot.  Been there.  Explain Tropic Thunder  for the people.  I don't know how  to explain this movie really.  Yeah,  it's one of those things  where it's about  a group of people  making a humongous  action movie  that kind of goes wrong  and I don't know,  kind of like in the vein  of Three Amigos,  like the actors involved  with it end up  in kind of like  real action  and yeah, 
[01:58:30]  I don't know.  I feel like if you  explain too much  it just becomes  totally confusing.  Yeah,  yeah,  absolutely.  Just watch it.  Who was in Three Amigos?  I had Martin Short,  Chevy Chase,  Steve Martin.  Was that in the film?  Yeah.  I already have a tremendous  amount more faith  in your film.  Not that Steve Martin's  not terrific,  but I want to see  this movie now.  There's something  about the movie,  this is how shallow I am.  The movie poster,  I'm like,  I don't know if I want  to see that.  Really?  Yeah,  and then all I hear  is how great it is 
[01:59:00]  and now I want to see it.  It's amazing how we  make these dumb decisions  based on one thing  you see in the movie poster  if the movie poster  doesn't grab me.  I was with you.  Maybe the name,  I don't know what it was.  I'm like,  I don't know,  Roland.  And he's like,  trust me on this one.  And then,  yeah.  It's the most expensive  R-rated comedy ever made.  Really?  Yeah.  Because of the explosions  and all the particles?  And all the big guns involved,  I assume,  yeah.  You were saying  like 200 million or something?  I'm not sure  what the exact figure is,  but it is a ton.  Wow. 
[01:59:30]  I was going to say,  oh,  controversy too  with the Simple Jack stuff.  Oh,  yeah,  I'm sure,  yeah.  The retard groups  are coming out of the woodwork.  They're everywhere.  They were picketing out  in front of here  when I came up,  yeah.  No.  Yeah,  yeah.  I was like,  are they?  I'm sure they're out  in front of the wrong  building somewhere.  In front of Tropicana,  a bunch of dopes.  So it's great,  man.  I mean,  when you're doing,  you're working like that  with people on that level,  it's just got to be nice  to know that like, 
[02:00:00]  at the premiere,  the people you like  are watching you work.  Because Tom Cruise  has to sit through your scenes.  He can't get up  and go to the toilet.  He has to,  yeah.  It's insane.  And you know,  with Pineapple,  I was talking to Judd  and he told me  that there was like,  he got a call  from Brian Grazer  that they just had  a screening of Pineapple  with like Barbra Streisand,  Tom Hanks,  all these crazy people  watching this like,  weed action movie.  It's the weirdest thing.  And I say so much  dirty, filthy stuff  and I'm like,  Barbra Streisand  has heard me  talk about how  James Franco  ate a box of nerds 
[02:00:30]  out of a stripper's butthole.  That's just incredible.  She probably likes that  dirty little babs.  You gotta think she's dirty  deep down.  When the doors are closed at night.  She likes her head  hung over the bed  and that giant nose  clamps shut.  Oh, absolutely.  I'm right there with you,  Jimmy.  Old naughty babs.  When you're like she is in public,  there's something going on  behind closed doors.  Without a tremendous sub.  I think she has a special belt  she likes to wear.  Yeah, she certainly does.  She makes her own  toilet cam videos  with her face bleeped out. 
[02:01:00]  I love Streisand.  Oh, yeah.  Closed circuit cameras  around her mansion.  Who's that husband?  Oh, she likes it cold  in her room, by the way.  James Brolin.  Yeah, apparently she likes  it to be very chilly.  I think James Brolin  is a cuckold.  Cuckold?  Either that  or he brings home  darker gentlemen  for Barbara.  And he dominates her  with other men.  I picture him  just sitting in the corner  crying as somebody else  he's brought in.  Yeah, he's ravaging her. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, okay.  While the guy yells  anti-white things at him  but he cowers with his...  Yeah, he just sits there  crying.  But he likes that.  A lot of those videos  are, too.  Yeah.  Cream pie afterwards.  And then he does  a cream pie afterwards.  Right.  Danny, you can stay  out of this discussion.  You're big time now.  We're not.  We can still do this.  Have you guys seen  the Chuck Berry video?  Chuck Berry?  Oh, the famous  Chuck Berry video.  Yeah, I love that.  Yeah, I've heard  about that one.  Smell my black fart.  You haven't seen that?  No.  No. 
[02:02:00]  Which one is he  talking about?  Oh, that sounds great.  Chuck Berry was into,  let's just say,  certain types of play  that would require one  to possibly land  under a coffee table  and look up.  Yeah.  Like an old Danny Kaye  a legend I liked.  Oh, good stuff.  And Sylvester Stallone.  Danny Kaye liked that?  Yeah.  And good old Sly,  we heard.  Yeah.  Back in the day.  Sly?  Yeah.  We did a whole bit  a few years back.  Or anything.  Oh, they would just  throw some of his movies  on top of the table.  That would be good news.  Well, I'm having  a little blockage.  How about if I just  throw, stop it,  my mom will shoot. 
[02:02:30]  Good enough.  Yeah, yeah.  Put over the top  on there now.  Get over the top.  That's a good one.  Boy, that stinks.  Oh, here comes Cobra.  I play Cabretti,  but it is Cobra.  You're the disease  and I'm the cure.  Shut up.  Are you?  For what?  Entertaining films?  Stroke mouth?  Shut it.  We have a nice thing  to say out about anybody. 
[02:03:00]  I just want to point out  Danny's not taking part  in this part of the episode.  Of course he is.  I'm mildly aroused.  He's just about to make it.  He doesn't need us  wrecking his Hollywood career.  But a lot of times  you're not in the scene.  Like, you know,  I had a funny scene  of Kevin Smith.  Oh, right.  Kevin Smith movie.  And apparently Seth Rogen's  in my scene.  Oh, nice.  But he wasn't in the room.  Oh, really?  So you never met Seth?  Well, I met him on,  you know,  when you're in the trailer,  sometimes people come up  and say hello.  Hey, I like your work.  You know, crap. 
[02:03:30]  You just talk.  Yeah, we haven't had  Seth on the show.  And now that he's big time,  it's not going to happen.  He's doing it on Mass  with Ron Bennington.  I think he can do it.  Yeah.  And Danny, by next year,  you're going to forget  our names, too.  It happens with all you guys.  No way, Tony and Mike.  This is going to be...  We say it all the time  and the listeners  are probably sick of hearing it,  but we see you guys  on the way up  and on the way down.  Be nice to the people  you meet on the way up  because you're going to  meet the same people  on the way down. 
[02:04:00]  Know who used to do  our show a lot?  Who?  Jack Black.  He doesn't do it anymore.  No.  Too big for us now.  Oh, come on.  The last time he saw him  was when he did the movie  with Colin Hanks.  Was it Orange County?  Yeah.  He came in after that.  Well, because he had to promote...  Did he?  He had to promote  that band thing.  Him and the...  Ah, right.  Him and that complete  lack of charisma,  Tenacious D partners.  The operation guy  with the guitar.  The operation guy.  Yeah.  We gave... 
[02:04:30]  Jack Black's anchor.  We gave Jack Black  one of the greatest moments  he's ever seen.  We had a girl  a midget.  He was in that day.  We were just talking  about this on the radio  and Patrice was in here  too that day.  This was pure  hack shock jockery.  Not really though  because it came out of nowhere.  This midget calls us  and she goes,  I want to become a stripper.  And we're like,  you've never stripped before?  She goes, no.  We're like,  well, come on down.  You got to strip for us.  We're experts.  Yeah.  You do a little strip,  we'll give you some tips 
[02:05:00]  and you'll be on your way,  right?  She comes in  and it's Patrice O'Neill,  it's Colin Hanks,  it's Jack Black  and this girl  gets on the console.  She's literally,  she is a midget  and she starts stripping  and we're kind of  getting into it  and all of a sudden  she just breaks down  and starts crying  in front of everybody.  Oh, that's fantastic.  Yeah.  Get the cracker.  It was great.  What, was she just not prepared  for what she was going to do?  Yeah, yeah,  because we were making  a few comments.  Oh.  And she realized  at that moment  that she really didn't  want to be a stripper anymore  but it was too late 
[02:05:30]  because she was pretty much naked  so now you got a naked midget crying.  And she couldn't get down  from the console  with those little bowed legs.  It was pretty sad  because we got to wheel  a chair up for her  to step on  to get up there  and we wheeled the chair away  so she's just staying up there  all bow-legged  naked and crying.  I have no idea  why Jack Black  wouldn't come back.  Yeah.  I don't know,  I think he enjoyed it  in some sick way.  Yeah, absolutely did.  He can't admit that  these days, I'm sure.  So are you shooting  anything now?  You know, 
[02:06:00]  I just finished shooting  Land of the Lost  with Will Ferrell,  a remake of that old 70s.  Wow.  With Chaka.  Chaka.  Who played Chaka?  This guy,  Jormit Ticcone,  he's an SNL writer.  He's a little,  small, skinny dude.  Yeah,  and he fit into  a little monkey outfit  and danced around  for three months.  I hope the special effects  are going to be as good  as the TV ones  because that was fantastic  when they're going  down the river  and then they get lost  and then the dinosaurs  were so realistic.  It was almost like  Jurassic Park  when the first time  I saw Jurassic Park. 
[02:06:30]  Trailblazers, yeah.  Yeah.  Did you put on  the Sleestack shoes?  I've always wanted  to have Sleestack feet.  Yeah.  There are real Sleestacks  in this movie, yeah.  Oh, really?  And they are horrifying, yeah.  They move so slow  and they hiss.  Yeah, it's bad.  It's a comedy, right?  It is.  You put Will Ferrell  being chased by a T-Rex  and it tends to be funny, yeah.  So wait,  let me get this straight.  So you're a funny guy  trying to make it.  You make Foot Fist's way.  Somehow Will Ferrell  sees the movie,  helps you out there  and now you've got  a relationship  so now he brings you 
[02:07:00]  into this other movie.  Into this huge budget.  Just like that.  Just like that.  That's how it goes, I guess.  That's how it happens.  It's nuts.  It's a topsy-turvy world  of Hollywood movie making.  That's unbelievable.  Just paid my student loans off.  I'm going to hire  10 assistants tomorrow.  Nice.  I'm on my way.  Blow it all.  Take advice from MC Hammer.  Just get a big posse,  buy a lot of stuff  and then lose it  and find Jesus.  Well, it's not a true  success story  unless you end up  with a VH1 documentary  made about how  shitty everything got.  Yeah, how you completely 
[02:07:30]  messed your life up.  Oh, but for us,  those are so enjoyable  to watch, man.  Now look, look.  Look what he did now.  What a dummy.  It's called It's Funny  because it's not me.  MC Hammer thought  he was going to just make  that type of money  for the next 20 years.  Yeah.  You've got to live  below your means  just a little bit.  Save a little for later.  How much of his posse,  I think, still calls him  or hangs out?  Wow.  None.  None, right.  They took the money  and ran.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  I'm looking at old  Sleestack footage now.  It makes me want to go out  and see that movie. 
[02:08:00]  The Sleestacks were so awful.  Oh, yeah.  They're nuts.  Big glassy black eyes.  Yeah, they weren't even fast.  I want to hear the song, too.  The middle of the land  in a lost song.  Yeah.  Marshall, Will, and Holly  on a routine expedition.  Yeah.  Mmm.  That movie doesn't come out  until next year, 2009.  15 years from now,  it'll come out.  That girl was so ugly  on that show.  She wasn't even like  a cute girl or anything.  I met her.  She came by the set one day.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, obviously,  all grown up.  All grown up. 
[02:08:30]  Did she look any better?  About the same.  About the same.  I don't think she would've  won you over.  Enough said.  What noise would Chaka make?  I hated Chaka when I was a boy.  Yeah, I was terrified by him.  Yeah.  I hated him.  Just sucked.  Liked him.  He'd come out  and just ruin everything.  Trying to have fun,  laughs, and enjoy yourself,  and Chaka spoils it.  What's the noise?  I don't remember.  It's like he speaks  this weird language.  Yeah, it's like a weird language.  Yeah.  How would he say,  Chaka?  Yeah.  Chaka.  Chaka.  Chaka.  Chaka. 
[02:09:00]  Chaka.  Chaka.  That's it.  Is that what he's doing?  Yeah, it's like some kind  of retarded baby talk.  I'd love to drill my fist  into Chaka's little piece.  I would brain-chaka  with a tire iron.  Well, we've got to end  this portion of the show.  Danny McBride,  it's a pleasure.  You've got two huge movies  coming out.  It's got to be noted,  the LA Times reported  you as being the next  big comedy star.  Not too much pressure, huh?  I'll take that for now. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  And then I'll go buy  an entourage  and a bunch of  gamer pants  and we'll see  where it ends up.  Hammer time.  You've got Pineapple  Express opening today,  getting great reviews,  and then you've got  Tropic Thunder,  which you're also in  starting next Wednesday.  Go see them both.  Nice.  Well, I saw one  out of the two so far  and hopefully  Pineapple Express today.  Well, Roland won't  say it on the air,  but he preferred  Tropic Thunder a lot.  No, he's equal.  Equal, I swear.  Roland, you better get here  and get in here  and defend yourself.  Non-committal douche.  Now, Roland. 
[02:10:00]  I will say this.  Pineapple today  and next week  see Tropic Thunder.  Which movie's better?  They both are equally good.  I mean,  they're two totally  different movies.  Yeah, and he's not  just riding the fence.  It literally is one of those  things I saw both of them  and was like,  damn, this is like  a pretty insane week  for movies.  Yeah, like this week,  I mean,  the only good movie  that's out  is Pineapple Express.  Like, Batman  never be seen already.  You loved Batman  and then he trashed  Batman after he saw  what?  X-Files?  David Duchovny was in here  and he was trying to 
[02:10:30]  impress Duchovny with  X-Files.  Yeah, he trashed  The Dark Knight  after loving it.  And he gave away  the fact that at the end  Christian Bale  takes off his mask  and apologizes  for that awful voice  he does through the whole film.  I'm sorry I overacted  like an ass.  Apologize for  embarrassing myself.  What do you like  about Tropic Thunder,  Roland?  Just that  everybody was so good.  Can you explain  the movie  to the people out there?  He gives the best  descriptions for movies. 
[02:11:00]  It's like,  it's a movie  that's about  them filming  a war movie.  And shenanigans  and stuff happens,  explosions.  What's an explosion?  Explosions.  And that's it?  No, it's...  You're not really  selling the movie.  People are leaving  their homes right now  trying to find it.  I don't know.  Via their windows.  He sweats a lot too.  That's why he's  wiping his eyes.  That's flop sweat.  He hates being on the air.  It's just a great 
[02:11:30]  comedy movie.  Don't give out anything.  It's just like  at the movies.  Yeah.  That would be great  to watch his movie.  I would watch Roland every week.  I'd go online  every freaking week  to see what he's saying  about the latest movies.  But they're both  awesome.  All right.  Danny McBride.  Thank you so much.  Thank you guys.  Thanks for having me on.  We're heading over to XM.  No problem.  You guys have a great day.  Yes, we will see you there.  Hello, XMers. 
[02:12:00]  How are you today?  Hi.  That's good.  I'm fine too.  Hi, everybody.  I just saw a headline,  President Bush in Thailand.  It just made me start  giggling and laughing.  In Thailand?  We've had that  discussion many times.  There's nothing to do  in Thailand  except have sex  with little kids.  And I'm not saying  that that's what  the president's going to do,  but we're convinced  that's the only reason  people go there.  Yeah.  That's how stupid we are.  Is there really other things  to do in Thailand?  No. 
[02:12:30]  It's a place you go  if you're a pedophile  to have sex  with young children.  It used to be a safe haven  for that activity.  Of course.  And then Gary Glitter  found out the heart.  Oh, no.  He was in Vietnam, right?  Was he?  He was doing that thing  in Vietnam,  but he's getting out.  In Southeast Asia.  He's getting out.  All right.  Lucky him.  And on the walkover,  I was walking with young Sam  and I found out that  there's going to be  a very special judge  for his wrestling thing  he's doing for the WWE. 
[02:13:00]  Really?  On Friday.  A surprise guest?  We're not going to announce  who it is?  No.  All right.  What time is Shane McMahon  showing up on?  It could be anyone.  Wow.  I mean,  could be anyone.  Oh, it could be anyone.  Shane O'Mac.  Are we talking Shane O'Mac?  That's a possibility.  What's this wrestling thing again?  Why don't we get this horse shit  out of the way early today?  Horse shit.  Okay.  That's a bunch of horse shit.  If you want to win a trip  to Indianapolis, Indiana  to go to SummerSlam,  all you have to do 
[02:13:30]  is invent a wrestling character  and do a wrestling promo  and then send me  that wrestling promo  and you'll be talking  about me or E-Rock  in the promo  and email it to me  at sam at opianthony.com.  All right.  And then the best wrestling promos  are going to get to come in here  on Friday,  this Friday,  and do their wrestling promos  live in studio.  Yep.  The best one  gets two tickets  to SummerSlam  along with airfare,  hotel,  the whole thing.  It's going to be great.  Okay.  Is it?  Danny's already tried to enter 
[02:14:00]  but he can't  because he's an employee.  But Danny,  can't you do one as a goof?  Just help out the bit  that's failing miserably?  I did help out the bit.  No,  exhibition.  I emailed Sam  a beautiful picture  of a big dick  and I felt that  I was contributing  to the bit.  It wasn't.  What's your wrestling character?  Me?  Yeah.  I'll have to think of one.  He calls himself  in the office  Danny Tube Steak.  No,  I don't.  Danny Tube Steak?  That's not what it is.  It's cooking steaks  and we all know it.  All right.  He goes by Danny Tube Steaks. 
[02:14:30]  Nice.  Hey,  by the way,  the dump sheet  was just unbelievable.  You had pissing in a bucket,  cock blocker.  So they did dump  pissing in a bucket.  Yeah.  Okay.  Wait,  pee,  I think they would let fly.  Piss,  they don't let fly,  man.  They haven't let piss  fly by in a long time.  No,  Stumper,  I misunderstood.  I thought he said  peed in a bucket  a couple of times.  He did before that.  Did that get dumped?  No,  they let that through.  That's what I'm saying.  As soon as he said  pissing,  they've always had  a problem with piss.  I don't think  they should be dumping it, 
[02:15:00]  but they've been dumping  that one for years.  Pissing in a bucket,  cock blocker,  fuck it,  fucked up,  fucking shit,  fuck,  fuck,  fucking fuck,  fucked up,  fucking fuck,  fuck,  assholes,  eating a box of nerds  out of a stripper's  butthole,  and shitty.  All of the above  was dumped out  of the regular radio portion  of the Anthony show today.  Big dump day  for the show.  Yeah.  Oh, man,  I was going to go to that guy.  He said that Bubba  had something to say  about us yesterday. 
[02:15:30]  Oh,  what could he possibly  have to say?  Getting under that  fat fuck skin,  it just makes me smile.  It makes me very,  very happy.  I guess he wants  to fight us again  or something like that.  Oh, yeah.  More dopey redneck behavior  from that swab.  Why doesn't he fucking stop?  A white trash  fucking fight.  Yeah,  let's fight.  We'll get a ring  and it'll all go,  the proceeds will go  to charity  and say,  shut up.  Shut up  and do your dumb show.  I'm like,  just talk in your real voice.  Yeah.  Fucking flood.  I'll be up there  in October  and I'll fight 
[02:16:00]  those guys.  And if the guys  want to,  who the fuck  talks like that?  Man Cow  and a bunch  of other guys.  They have that same  fucking fake voice  delivery.  Oh,  I want to.  I want to.  You just shut up  with your stupid  redneck behavior  and do your dumb  radio show.  Impossible.  He's a stupid  redneck.  What is it?  What's he going to do?  Huh?  What's he going to do?  He's a stupid redneck.  That's like,  that's the only way  he knows how to act. 
[02:16:30]  That's what he does,  right?  That's all he does.  That's all.  All right.  Listen,  I wish that guy,  he'll call back maybe.  Laura Ingram,  totally frustrated  with her.  I loved her on  Little House on the Prairie.  No.  And then Paul would  come and help.  What?  What was her real name?  I forgot now.  Laura Ingalls.  Ingalls,  right.  Okay.  I forgot.  I liked when the littlest  one tripped and fell  on her face running  down the hill  at the beginning.  Yeah.  Always give me  a little chuckle.  Sorry she got up. 
[02:17:00]  Hey,  Jimmy,  were you one of the  people that went  too far on the  Bob Saget rose?  Because that's getting  some legs.  With the Olsen twins?  No,  I barely,  I had one joke  written for them,  actually two jokes,  and I didn't do  either one of them  because both of the  concepts were like  done by then.  Okay.  So I was like,  why even do them?  Saget has this weird  thing for the Olsen twins.  I think what happened  was,  because he's a filthy,  filthy comic.  We love him,  but you make fun  of the Olsen twins,  he kind of steps 
[02:17:30]  back a little bit.  I don't think  Saget's really mad.  I think that what Saget  is just saying,  hey,  you know,  well,  people went a little  too far.  And then when you,  sometimes you take  something without  inflection and you  read it,  it plays differently.  Yeah.  Like,  well,  you know,  some of them  went too far.  Like,  yet that comes off  as some of them  went too far.  You can read the same.  Could have been joking.  Absolutely.  Or he's just saying  that to protect them  because he knows  since they were  little children.  I can almost  understand that.  He didn't give shit  to any comedians. 
[02:18:00]  The comedians  were fucking brutal.  Yeah,  I'm asking,  that's why I'm trying  to get to the bottom.  Gilbert was brutal.  Oh,  I bet.  Really?  Hilarious.  Yeah.  Hilarious,  but brutal.  And this thing's  going to be on soon,  right?  The 17th,  it looks like.  That's crazy.  All right.  Which is nice.  Let's move on.  So we got Laura Ingram.  We got some  behind the scenes audio  when she was doing  something for Fox.  And it's pretty funny.  She just loses her mind.  We've been trying  to get to this for weeks.  Also,  we got Daniel Gardner  coming in,  the science of fear. 
[02:18:30]  It's one of my  favorite topics,  actually.  The Culture of Fear  and all that.  Yep.  What the media does  to scare the shit  out of us.  And he's got this book,  The Science of Fear.  We'll talk about that  in a little bit.  It should be  quite interesting.  But first,  Laura Ingram.  Okay,  but we're having  to edit copy  at 10 minutes  before the hour,  so I don't know  what to do.  And new tonight.  Is we okay with  you?  And new tonight.  No,  why are we saying  new tonight?  We should say  in this just in.  Just in.  And this just in, 
[02:19:00]  dot, dot, dot.  Barack Obama  talking about  the importance.  No,  it's not just.  Okay.  Why is this new tonight?  Guys,  it's not new tonight.  He gave this.  No, no, no.  But he gave the speech  yesterday.  That's the Fox  way of doing things?  Okay,  then what is this?  What's in the prompter  now?  Do you want?  Is this an intro  to Raymond  or a tease? 
[02:19:30]  You guys have seen me  so confused  with these long.  It's a long intro.  Did you edit it down?  Yeah.  She's just revving up,  man.  Damn,  they do sound  pretty incompetent  over there.  Which are boobs.  Yeah,  we look toward  these stations  for news  and they don't know  what the fuck  they're doing.  Oh,  she's had it up  to here with these  fucking,  well,  they're incompetent.  They're blundering.  Catch and release  may work for fishing,  oy,  but it is not  stopping the flow  of a list. 
[02:20:00]  No, no.  Did you not give  the edits to this,  Brian?  Remember I,  no, no,  remember I gave you  the edits?  I changed it.  I changed it.  Okay,  the edits were never  done to this segment.  This,  this,  no,  but I mean  to that tease.  Yeah,  it was much shorter.  It was,  I cut out a whole  paragraph.  No, no,  no,  but okay,  but this was  actually edited by,  Brian had the edits  and get,  no, no,  but this is wrong.  Brian,  I handed it to you. 
[02:20:30]  I don't,  I changed it physically.  I don't know why.  Brian said he changed it.  He did not change it.  Okay,  back it up please.  Get rid of all this.  I don't want to see all this.  It's making me nervous.  Okay,  we have two minutes  to show time.  30,  can we clear please?  We have 30 seconds  to show time.  30 seconds for what?  To you.  To the show start.  Well,  can someone like,  I thought you said  three minutes.  Jesus,  God in heaven.  Raymond,  turn this off.  You just said three minutes.  Okay.  And the word  the is spelled wrong 
[02:21:00]  in the prompter.  The word the  is spelled wrong?  They make it  look effortless  when you watch,  yeah,  watch Fox,  right?  All this crap  is going on  behind the scenes.  Can you get Tom,  please,  in here,  Brian,  as I asked  at the beginning  of the segment?  And what was that,  what happened  at the beginning  of the segment,  Jessica?  Can you tell him  about this?  Okay,  so there was  a mistake  in the rundown.  Is that the way,  is that why it happened?  Because, 
[02:21:30]  okay,  so we're not timing  out our thoughts properly.  Add that to the list.  That looked horrible  and it screwed me up  at the beginning  of the segment.  Ridiculous.  Can you look at this,  please,  in the back?  Can you guys clear up?  And where is Tom?  Can someone get me him?  A little higher,  please,  a little higher.  Can you call him,  Jessica,  or have someone? 
[02:22:00]  Oh my God.  He was supposed  to be in here  for that last segment  and he wasn't.  Two minutes,  a little bit higher.  And Jessica,  you're in my ear  for,  quiet,  you're in my ear  for too long  when you say  we have a side  of Obama,  it's too much.  You've got to be in  for a second.  You can't,  it's,  I'm not having elements  that,  don't come in my ear.  Just don't.  Don't come in my ear.  I needed you in here.  Good clip.  Well,  forget it.  Forget what else  you're working on.  I needed you in here  for this block  and it's too late now. 
[02:22:30]  Asked for you  at the beginning  of the block,  the beginning  of this segment.  It was terrible.  We have one more clip  to go,  but I'm ready  to form my opinion.  Yeah.  She's a cunt.  She's a cunt  working with incompetence.  I don't know,  I think she's holding it  together fairly well.  Yeah,  but she's not yelling.  But there's really not  all hell breaking loose.  I think she's making it  way more than it is.  Three minutes.  To what?  To you?  Tom?  No,  I didn't change it. 
[02:23:00]  Like all the shit  she wanted it done  and nobody did  what they were supposed to do.  That's true.  She's fucking hard enough.  She's got it on TV.  What are they trying to do?  That she's bitching  because the word the  is not written right  on a tele...  Who cares?  I think it's...  Yeah,  I think it's a combination  of everything.  Yeah.  Like the whole thing  seems to be falling apart.  Yeah,  I think she's had it up to here  with that bungling.  Yeah.  A bunch of fucking  Batman police.  What are you talking about,  Lenny?  You're talking too much. 
[02:23:30]  You've got to just  quiet, please.  I cannot focus.  Good.  Why do I have...  Okay.  I'm talking about  the Clintons  with Dick Morris.  This Gitmo thing  is old.  Okay?  It's ridiculous.  Gitmo.  I asked for two basic things  that I didn't get.  The favorability rating  of Congress  and the RealClearPolitics average.  I got neither of them.  Two basic facts.  Stand by please  in five.  Until it was too late.  When you're on  your cakes. 
[02:24:00]  Is makeup coming in  to powder me?  Because I look shining  on my forehead.  I mean,  somebody's got to  look at this stuff  except me.  Raymond,  you've got to  not do that.  Can someone tell me  when I actually  am supposed to speak?  Because I hear  30 seconds from you  and Linda gives me  15 seconds.  Routinely,  this is happening.  So,  we need to...  I don't even have any...  I don't have any questions.  Any questions  for this bug guy?  Other than  are you kidding me?  It's too short.  Everything's cut too short.  Can't see its face at all. 
[02:24:30]  Less than a minute  back to you.  No tag.  It's too short.  It's too cut too short.  It's confusing.  Nobody can follow this.  It's all right.  You can't see him at all.  Look at this.  Look at the way  this is shot.  You're going straight  to E2.  No tag.  Look.  Oh, my God.  Train wreck.  This is a train wreck.  No question.  Nothing prepared. 
[02:25:00]  Ooh.  You don't have to  take that up.  You're clear.  You just carry this out.  Just get it off me, please.  No question.  She's had enough.  A little angry.  She's had enough.  She wants shit done.  Let's see how to Mike  on Long Island.  Mike.  Hey, I'm waiting  for Laura to say  why would this work?  Sounds like anything  there in the studio  with you guys.  True.  Are you trying to say  that Laura works  with a lot of E-Rocks? 
[02:25:30]  Possibly.  Possibly.  Poor E-Rock.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Bob  in Florida.  Bob.  Hey.  What's going on, guys?  Hi.  Yeah, Boop.  What's up, Boop?  I was just Boop here.  I'm down here in Tampa.  And I flipped over  to Bubba's local show  while you guys were  doing the walkover  or whatever.  And there's a 17-year-old  pest that calls him up. 
[02:26:00]  And really,  Bubba tries to handle it,  but those two other  shit dicks,  they get really,  really pissed.  And he really got  under their skin today.  Oh, good.  If you can pull the audio  on that, you'll love it.  Oh, really?  Awesome.  Yeah, he wants to fight you  for real, physical fight.  Of course.  Yeah, good.  That's what you have to do  when you're not funny.  Right.  See, that's the difference  between a funny person  who can come back  and a fucking,  a hasty douchebag  who fucking talks 
[02:26:30]  in a phony voice.  Ah, I want to hit you.  Shut up.  Will he wear his duvet?  Because that would be  a little rough to hit him  with all that padding  from the fucking bedroom  quilt he's wearing.  I think he's probably  already got enough padding  to try and get through to him.  Well said.  Just call up.  You guys are trying  to sound like real tough guys  and a 17-year-old kid  is just tearing him up.  He's not a smart man.  He's a stupid,  stupid broadcaster.  Yes.  Just tell him to shut  his fat fucking mouth 
[02:27:00]  and do his radio show.  We didn't even know  what Bubba was up to.  I've got to be honest with you.  I had no clue.  And then out of nowhere,  he started taking shots at us.  So of course  we're going to attack back.  And he continues  to take shots at us.  Shut your fucking mouth  and do your dumb show.  Just a big dumb fatso.  Just a big fucking fatso.  Dumb down your dumb show  and shut the fuck up.  He's trying to ride  your coattails a little bit.  I love two days ago.  He's like,  we do things smart here. 
[02:27:30]  As part of the Howard Stern team.  We do things smart.  He did the dumbest radio bit ever.  He killed a fucking animal  in a parking lot  and he's going to turn around  and say that we don't do  smart radio.  Go fuck yourself.  He's the same lying scumbag  who said that  we were not going to be  on satellite renewed.  Right.  Like we were going to be  off satellite in a week.  He's the same dumb scumbag  that said if we're a part  of the new company, 
[02:28:00]  he won't stay.  Well, you know what?  We will be a part  of the new company.  Bye bye.  So fucking be a man.  Back up what you said  and fucking hit the bricks.  Bye bye.  Beat it.  Yeah, he's been obsessed.  He's been obsessed  with us failing  for the longest time  and we never even said  anything about this dummy.  He stinks.  I do believe that  I do believe there's  a bit of jealousy there  because he had to go  and kiss Howard Stern's ass  to be hurt on Sirius  and he decided to do that.  Whatever, man.  You know,  God bless you 
[02:28:30]  that you did that  but there's definitely  a jealousy there  that we didn't have  to do any of that.  and we're still  our own people  and if we work together  it's because both shows  have decided  look,  it's in everyone's interest  to get along  and the hostilities  are done  and that's great.  But it wasn't a move  out of desperation  or an insincere move  which with him  it was like  I gotta survive.  What can I do?  Okay.  Right.  Fuck him.  I think maybe  the worst part  is the other two guys  there.  Dude, I don't even know. 
[02:29:00]  Hold on, hold on.  The other two guys.  You ready for this?  I couldn't tell you  their names  if my life  depended on it.  They're talking about  how dumb  your staff is  and how smart  they are  and the guy  even got so pissed  he challenged  your staff  to an IQ test.  Oh, what a corn ball.  Like I said  he's a stupid broadcaster.  What a hack.  That is just  dumb radio.  We don't want to  challenge us  to an IQ test.  We don't want to  do any contests  with you. 
[02:29:30]  We don't want to  do any fun  charity events.  You do your shitty show.  We'll languish  in our mediocrity  and just shut the fuck up  and stop trying to play  like you're going to  leave the company.  You're not.  You're not.  I swear to you  I have no idea  anyone else's name  on that show.  No.  No fucking clue.  I have listened  to maybe a total  of an hour of his show  in the 20 some odd  years he's broadcasted  and that is a fact.  I listened to a little  of the audio  of him killing  a fucking animal  in a parking lot  and I listened  to some of  the slams 
[02:30:00]  he goes off  on us  whatever.  Yeah the slams  on us.  I just want to say  one last thing  I got to go here  I'm in heavy traffic  but I think  Mel Carmazzi  linger longer  said it best  Bubba's not  on the table.  There you go.  Thank you sir.  The board.  Alright let's go  to Ed in Philly.  Ed.  He said the board.  Ed.  Hey Ope.  Yes.  Hey what I listened  to his replay  this morning  what this guy's  talking about  and you probably  you're going to 
[02:30:30]  hate me  because I bought  your stickers  and his too  but what he has  a problem  with something  I don't know  what happened  but apparently  you busted  on Howard's  daughters  a couple years  ago or whatever  and I wanted  to get on  and say  I remember  you saying  about you  had a problem  with Howard  when he said  something about  what your dad  something that  went on  with your dad  there  but that's  what he was  saying  he was talking  about the daughter  yeah but  who is Bubba  to you know  talk about  that shit 
[02:31:00]  yeah I had  a problem  with Howard  going after  my dead dad  and Howard  had a problem  with me  going after  his daughters  yeah absolutely  that's what  happened  yeah  like I said  I couldn't  get on there  to talk  like I said  I listen  to you guys  are number one  I do listen  to him  I think  they're good  and I listen  to Howard  but it was  I gotta tell  you Ed  I don't even  know if Bubba  is good  what he's doing  is this dude  really harsh  things were said  on both sides  it happens  when you're  fighting for years  it's part of it 
[02:31:30]  what he's trying  to do  is he's so  irritated  that he knows  this show  is higher profile  than his show  higher profile  and he's trying  to bring up  those things  to try to get  people  or Howard  to go  oh yeah  I forgot  about that  let's start  he's just  being a little  bitch  like as a man  why do you care  I have no idea  what went on  between Howard  and Bubba's show  or Bubba  and Mancow  honest to god  it means  nothing to me  it's absolutely  irrelevant to me  what has got on 
[02:32:00]  with his show  in any way  shape or form  nothing to do  with my life  I think it's funny  that he talks  in a fake voice  I think that's funny  I love that  I got under his skin  that makes me  very happy  very fucking happy  what about that  thing you said  who  do you  he's just a dummy  he's just a dumb  broadcaster  don't be a hack  he's just a dummy  can't help it  you know  I think the thing here  we got Chuck Liddell  on the phone  I'll be up there  in October  we're gonna fight 
[02:32:30]  yeah are we  how about  just be funny  and while we're  fighting  my staff's gonna  do an IQ test  with your staff  yeah  wow  we could have  a three-legged  potato race  you bag of  still working on  the charity  for our fight  good shit  yeah what a fucking  dumb  shut up  if they're part  of the new company  I'm not gonna be  I'm out  give me the two clips  please  give me the clip  where he says  that it's a deal breaker  if we're part  of the new company  and then give me  the clip  where he has to 
[02:33:00]  fucking backpedal  like a dummy  because nobody cared  right  how about the clip  where he said  we were gonna be  off satellite radio  he's just a fucking  he's just one of those  dummies who says  like somebody hands him  a note and he just  says it  alright thanks Ed  let's go to David  in Alabama man  David what's up  hey guys good morning  good morning  listen two things  I have a quick  whip them out  Wednesday story  I finally thought  I was getting my  payoff  dude and his chick  I guess on the back  of a motorcycle 
[02:33:30]  and this was a  haggard out  biker chick  and you know  I was like okay  and she pulls her  shirt up  and I guess she had  recently been  mastectomized  or whatever the word is  so she pulled her  shirt up  and there was  one of them gone  and it looked like  the top of like  a Chinese dumpling  just puckered skin  oh nice  they just cackled  and cackled  as they rode off  nice  the other thing  is I lived in  Florida for a long  while and I used  to listen to  you know  for lack of better  radio  on terrestrial radio  his local station  there 
[02:34:00]  I love how the  people have to  defend what  you know  well I listen to  but this is the  reason  we're not gonna  attack you  like if you like  Bobby's show  when I know  I'm gonna attack you  it's like alright  you like it  it makes me laugh  you know  when Jimmy went  through his black  guy phase  you kind of  you know  you went through  something  you're not proud  of it now  but anyway  he used to  always talk  about Linda Hogan  how wonderful  incredible  he'd plug a  restaurant  he would just  kiss their ass  you know  obviously because  of Hulk Hogan  and that whole  love affair  going on  but he would  just rant  and rave  she's an  incredible this 
[02:34:30]  and incredible that  and about three  weeks ago  I had a rental  car  and he's a liar  he's not a  smart man  and I don't  mean that  to insult the guy  he's just not  a smart human being  he really is  he's a dummy  no and you can  just hear it  I mean and it's  not meant to be  a slam  he's just a  dumb person  and he went  on you know  when all this  stuff went down  I guess with  Hulk Hogan  and his wife  with the divorce  and all  he went on  this tirade  about I've  never liked  her  she's a  hippocan  you start  thinking this  guy is just  an absolute  spineless liar  phony  phony  phony  phony  ass kissing 
[02:35:00]  liar  sounds to me  like this guy  is a phony  baloney  dude you could  be redneck  funny and be  successful at it  but that's not  too impressive  in my book  he's redneck  funny you know  he's got a  little niche  for himself  but he's just  a dumb guy  I just don't  respect him  because of that  horse shit  posturing  like it's a  deal breaker  no one cares  who would care  if it's a deal  breaker  they're trying to  save money  fucking make like  a tree and  leave  fucking beat 
[02:35:30]  it fatso  no one gives a  shit  uh oh we might  lose Bubba  get the phones  might lose  Bubba's leaving  gives a shit  bye  no one would  care  no  cigars and scotch  Bubba challenges  you guys to a  cholesterol contest  that's right  his is 680  what do you got  yeah you would  win that one  my friend  uh Joe  Florida  what's up  how's it going  um  hey  I'm here in  Florida  I've been listening  to fucking  this Bubba  the Love Spun  show every now  and then  and all this  guy does 
[02:36:00]  is he starts  shit with  everyone around  here  you guys aren't  the only one  but you're  the first  one to speak  out against  them  and finally  someone's  gonna shut  the fuck  up  all right  thank you  eric says  we never had  original deal  break audio  what the fuck  are you kidding  me  maybe we didn't  I remember  hearing him say  that would be  a deal breaker  what is he  talking about  didn't we  play that  no I think  it was a post  I'm looking  for it right  now I think  it was uh  someone had  posted a quote  from him on  the New York  radio message  board  an orbit cast 
[02:36:30]  or something  because I  remember him  saying deal  it would be  a deal breaker  and he said  that kind  of a little  funny  yeah  all right  I think  what really  got to  Bubba was  the fact  that my  brother sang  his wonderful  song at  that Halloween  oh wow  people loved  it  we haven't  played that  in a while  have we  I don't think  so  all right  let's play  this  my brother  brother Elmo  on MySpace  came up with  this diddy  I don't know  guys I don't  want to  tangle with  Bubba  he might  beat us  up in the  octagon and 
[02:37:00]  then have  an IQ test  and shut  up  we're all  going to  put eggs  on spoons  and we're  going to  see who  can run  the far  of this  without dropping  the egg  off the  spoon  you fucking  idiot  fucking hump  shut up  Patrick on  Long Island  we're all  going to bake  cookies and the  people are  going to taste  the cookies  and judge  who's the  best baker  on the  staff  morning fellas  I got to  correct Jimmy  make like a  tree and get  out of here  much better  very good  and you  know if  you guys  have an IQ 
[02:37:30]  test with  Bubba's  staff you  got to  bring Boston  as a  rigger with  his 140  yeah the  140 would  help us  out in the  IQ challenge  absolutely  thank you sir  you're right  about that  let's say  hi to  Corinne in  Jersey  Corinne  hey guys  I think  you should  fly over  Sirius radio  in a hot  air balloon  and drop  bombs on  are you  suggesting  it's time  for another  brah bombing  brah bombing  I'm in  yeah  alright  here's my 
[02:38:00]  brother's song  I think  this is what  really got  to Bubba  what happened  I was just  pointing at the  book because I  believe our  guest is here  I was just  showing it  I think our  guest is here  I didn't know  that  that hack  no he's  very good  yeah my  goodness  we're going to  talk to Daniel  Gardner next  the science of  fear  it's a  topic I  love discussing  and he's got  a book  about that  and we'll do  that next  but first  my brother's  song about  Bubba  listen to 
[02:38:30]  these pipes  boys  yeah  oh  there you  go  oh  oh look  at the fleet  of feet  Irish  see the  pandemic  does she  does she  come  please  that fucking  Bubba  the  horse  is  up in his  face  with me  what is  Bubba  the  horse  is a  cunt  he's a  cunt  he's a  cunt  we hate  us

[02:40:00]  MAMA IS A CUT!  It's a fucking car! 
[02:40:30]  Sorry.  It's a fucking car!  Wow!  Papa is a gun!  It's gonna make it so hard!  Papa is a gun!  Papa is a gun!  Papa is a gun!  He's killing!  Papa is a gun!  Yeah!  Now he made that his own. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah...  A lot of guys can't leave the song and improv  and come in the way you're supposed to.  You know...  Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na!  There you go.  I just love the guy trying to hold it together  by chiming in with the na na na,  just trying to bring it back home.  It's just gonna go into the original version  after all that.  Oh, people thought that happened at FH Reilly's.  No, that was at Hard Rock. 
[02:41:30]  I think we had about 800 people in that joint that night.  I thought there was FH Rollers, too.  No, that was at the Halloween party.  Wow, I thought that was FH.  No, no.  My brother didn't really sing, now, did he?  He was just kind of yelling and screaming.  He was yelling.  It was all right.  It was kind of like a sand.  Yeah, my brother's extremely protective of his brother.  It's healthy.  Very healthy. 
[02:42:00]  All right, we're going to take a quick break,  and we'll continue with Daniel Gardner next.  Stay there.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  And entering our studio, Daniel Gardner,  the author of The Science of Fear,  Why We Fear the Things We Shouldn't  and Put Ourselves in Greater Danger.  I love this topic.  That's interesting.  What?  Because, as you know,  I have been dubbed  paranoid 
[02:42:30]  a scaredy cat.  I've been called that.  But not because of the media.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  The media scares you?  Well, that's what a lot of people said.  I've been affected by the media  with things like home invasion reports  and whatnot.  So, I'm very interested in finding out  what this gentleman,  his take is on this,  The Science of Fear.  Yeah, this started for me  with Bowling for Columbine,  and then there was a book  that they referenced a lot  in that movie called  The Culture of Fear. 
[02:43:00]  I've read every single page  of that book,  and I've been obsessed with it  ever since.  And now when I watch TV,  I watch it very, very differently  because I realize  they're tricks.  They're trickery.  Newsertainment, I call it,  because, um...  Sure.  You know, it's not like the old days  where Cronkite got there,  it was a desk, a clock,  and he told you the news.  Now they have to get you to watch  with teases  that include scary things  about what could kill you  and your children  and what car are you driving 
[02:43:30]  because it could kill you.  We'll tell you what it is  after this.  Are these the kind of things  that are included in...  Oh, absolutely.  That's a big chunk of it.  You know, I'm a journalist,  but, you know...  So were we, by the way.  That's right.  Yes.  Occasionally we, you know,  change hats  from shock-chockery  to a journalist, but...  Yeah, no, the media  have to take a big, big chunk  of the responsibility.  In the book, basically,  I talk about three factors.  One is, the biggest is psychology.  People have to understand  that basically the brain evolved 
[02:44:00]  in a Stone Age environment,  and we live in the information age.  There's a big mismatch  between our brains  and the way we process information  and the world we live in.  The second factor is the media,  which, if you want to go  into a good bash,  I can do that for quite some time.  We've done it on this program.  I like that point you bring up, though,  because we're still...  Our minds are still pretty instinctual  when it comes to certain things,  especially fear, fight or flight.  We're very emotional  when it comes to things like that,  and it is based on things 
[02:44:30]  we had to deal with  many, many years ago,  but it's still ingrained in us.  So, some of these reports  strike a nerve  on a more instinctual level  than intellectually.  That's exactly right.  Look, cognitive psychologists say  you have two minds  making decisions.  You have your conscious mind,  the mind's having this conversation,  but there's also  an unconscious mind.  And in fact,  most of the work  that the brain does  actually happens  below the level  of consciousness.  And now you have to ask yourself,  well, how does it do that?  Well, it does that 
[02:45:00]  using mechanisms  which were created  in this ancient environment, right?  This, the old Stone Age environment.  Our species has existed  for about 200,000 years.  And in virtually all that time,  we lived as, you know,  nomadic hunter-gatherers  and small bands.  And so,  your unconscious mind  is really well-wired  for that environment.  But unfortunately,  we don't live in that environment.  We sit down,  we turn on the evening news,  and what do you see?  You see live images  broadcast by satellite  of, you know,  freaky, horrible tragedies,  unusual stories 
[02:45:30]  from around the planet.  And the brain  that's processing  this information  is exactly the same  as the brain  of a caveman.  I mean, quite literally.  Oh, wow.  Our ability to invent technology  that can bring us  so much information  has definitely outpaced  our evolution  of our own minds.  Yeah, exactly.  Look, the technology  has changed,  the brain has not.  Your brain,  my brain,  is exactly the same  in its fundamentals  as the brain  of a caveman  20,000 years ago. 
[02:46:00]  You do get this  visceral reaction sometimes  to certain things  you see on television,  especially when it comes  to violence.  Yeah.  War footage,  beheadings,  things like that.  It affects you  very deeply  on an emotional level  that goes well beyond  the intellectual level.  That is the unconscious  mind talking to you  because by definition  you're not aware  of what's happening  in the unconscious mind.  But the unconscious mind  communicates to consciousness.  It communicates in the form  of emotions,  feelings, 
[02:46:30]  intuitions,  hunches.  When you have a sense  that something's true  but you can't quite explain why,  that's a product  of your unconscious mind.  Now, very often  that stuff works, right?  Intuition's good.  You know,  if it didn't work  it wouldn't be wired  into us.  Right.  The problem is,  as I say,  you know,  the information environment  has changed  so we get things wrong.  A great example of this  is parents are afraid  of having their children  abducted by strangers,  right?  I've got young kids,  every parent,  everywhere in the Western world.  I've been doing interviews  for this book  all across the Western world  you hear exactly  the same story. 
[02:47:00]  You know,  before we used to  let the kids out  and let them run around  and play loose.  We don't do that anymore.  You can't let,  oh, you can't let a child  play unsupervised  because they'll be abducted  and murdered by strangers,  right?  Well,  the research shows  it's absolutely clear.  That threat is microscopic.  It's incredibly rare.  An American child  is 26 times more likely  to die in a car crash  than to be abducted  by a stranger.  But what are American parents doing?  They're putting them in cars  and driving them to school  to keep them safe  from the pervert  in the bushes.  While they're walking.  Yeah, they could be walking.  That's hilarious. 
[02:47:30]  Actually be safe.  You know,  going with that point,  what fascinated me  about this fear thing  was the Halloween scare  they do every year  on the news.  And when you start  looking at the stats  of that,  kids are not being poisoned  by strangers.  And the razor blades.  And the razor blades.  And the apple.  And the pins and all that.  All mythology.  Right.  They actually,  there was a guy  who did research on that.  I don't remember exactly,  but it was a handful  of cases,  and in most cases  it was their own family 
[02:48:00]  killing the kid  for life insurance money.  But people ignore that,  and now you don't allow  your kids to go  house to house  on Halloween.  Now it has to be  in a safe environment  at a mall  or what,  a little block party  where you know everybody  and you know  your kids aren't going  to get any,  quote,  poison candy.  In the book,  I call this  a media feedback loop.  See,  what happens is this.  Let's go back  to the summer of 2001,  before 9-11.  What were people afraid of?  Everyone's forgotten this.  It was the summer 
[02:48:30]  of the shark.  Oh, the sharks.  Remember the sharks?  Right?  What happens is  you have one dramatic incident.  You know,  somebody's killed  by a shark.  This becomes a major news item.  Well, then,  because everybody's  paying attention to sharks,  well, that establishes  a narrative.  Shark attacks are in the news.  So the media go looking  for other stories  involving sharks.  And even if there's,  you know,  the shark takes a swipe  at somebody's foot,  which is a really minor story  that normally wouldn't  make it into the news,  now, because it's  an established narrative,  it makes it into the news.  And then,  because you start to pile up  these other minor incidents, 
[02:49:00]  you've got a whole bunch  of incidents.  And then it looks like,  oh boy,  this looks like a trend.  And so it feeds on itself.  And they do a story  about the trend  and how,  oh my God,  look at how many attacks  there have been.  Takes on a life of its own.  Exactly.  My brother is a marine biologist,  so between knowing  this culture of fear  and getting knowledge  from my brother,  I'm still scared  to go into the ocean anyway.  So that one still gets me.  And I love going in the ocean, 
[02:49:30]  but I'm always looking  over my shoulder like,  all right,  where is this fucking shark?  That's your unconscious mind.  You can't turn it off.  You can't turn it off.  Look,  I'm a parent.  I have young children.  I've done the research  on stranger abductions.  I know what the truth is,  and yet I still have  the same irrational fear  that everyone else has  because you can't turn it off.  The only thing you can do  is you can bring  your conscious mind to bear.  You can learn  what the facts are,  and you can say,  you know what?  That fear is irrational,  and I'm not going to go with it.  You know what, though?  Now, there's another side  to this whole thing,  and this is where  my own personal, 
[02:50:00]  what has been called paranoia,  slips in.  Long Island, New York  is where I live,  and it seems to have turned  into the home invasion  capital of the world  if you pay attention  to the news.  Now, obviously,  this isn't happening  to every house  on every block,  but when it does pop up,  I've been convinced  that I am not going to be  the guy that gets caught  in one of these situations,  so, you know,  I prepare myself  for things like that, 
[02:50:30]  and you could absolutely say,  look, the stats show  that the odds  of that happening  are minuscule,  but that guy  that's getting  that phone cord  wrapped around his neck  while he's watching  his family be beaten,  it did happen to him,  so, you know,  where do you draw  the line between  statistically,  this is insignificant,  and, all right,  someone wins lotto  every so often,  you know,  it's a very hard line to... 
[02:51:00]  It's actually pretty simple.  It's really,  it's simple,  it's pragmatic.  You simply have to ask yourself,  what's the cost?  What's the cost  of paying attention  to this risk,  and what's the cost  of actually responding to it?  Chances are,  if I let my child out  to ride a bicycle  without a helmet on,  my kid's going to be okay,  but I'm going to make her  wear a helmet  because the cost  is nothing, right?  Right, it's not really  an inconvenience,  it's not a big deal.  Crazy.  So, you know,  I'm going to deal  with that risk, okay.  But when you start  to get into other responses, 
[02:51:30]  the costs actually  start to really add up.  Irrational fear  can really diminish  the quality of your life, right?  If you don't go out  after night  because you irrationally  fear the, you know,  the safety of your neighborhood,  you're diminishing  the quality of your life.  That's not good stuff.  Even more dramatic responses,  after 9-11,  this is probably  the most horrible story.  After 9-11,  everybody knows, you know,  the sequence of events  after 9-11,  including the anthrax attacks,  which we're still  talking about, right?  Right, yeah.  Well, here's something  that nobody talked about.  Well, people didn't want to fly. 
[02:52:00]  So what did they do?  They still had to get around.  Millions of Americans  decided, oh,  it's too dangerous to fly,  too dangerous to go  to the airport.  So what did they do?  They got in their cars  and drove.  Well, guess what?  Flying is way safer  than driving.  It's so much safer  that, in fact,  if there had been  a wave of fatal terrorist  hijackings after 9-11,  it still would have been  far safer to fly.  But because you have  millions of Americans  making the switch.  Now, if you're one person  and you make the switch,  you're probably going to be okay  because driving's not  that dangerous, right?  But if you have millions  of people doing this thing, 
[02:52:30]  it's a pretty predictable  result, right?  Somebody's, as you say,  somebody's going to lose  the lottery, right?  Okay?  And in fact,  researchers have crunched  their numbers,  and what they've determined  is that this switch  from flying to driving  lasted for about one year  after 9-11.  And in that time,  because of that  irrational fear,  1,595 people  died on American roads  who would not have died  had they flown instead.  So there was  that many more deaths  above the average  is what you're saying.  Exactly right.  But tell those people  on September 12th 
[02:53:00]  to get on a plane.  Yeah.  But that's the other side  of the brain  that we're learning  about today.  You know,  I'm going to cut people slack.  You know,  for weeks after 9-11,  I understand.  You know,  I'm not a Vulcan here.  You know,  weeks after 9-11,  everybody felt the same way,  right?  But the point is  this switch from flying  to driving actually  lasted for a year.  And six months  after 9-11,  where were politicians  saying,  hey, everybody,  you know,  calm down.  What's the actual risk  to an average American?  How likely is it  that the average American  will be killed  by a terrorist?  It's incredibly unlikely. 
[02:53:30]  The average American  is far more likely  to drown in a bathtub  than to be killed  by a terrorist.  When was the last time  you heard a politician  say that?  Yeah.  They don't want to be.  They don't.  But they don't want  to be the guy  that says that  and then the next day  there's a bomb  in their city.  That's exactly right.  It's a political calculation.  Right, right.  It's a political calculation  and I understand  the political calculation  but it's a lack  of leadership.  It would have helped  Americans if somebody  had said,  you know what,  terrorism is serious.  We're going to get  the bad guys.  We're going to take  this seriously  but it's important  for everybody  to calm down  because the risk  to any one person 
[02:54:00]  is minuscule.  Yeah, throw some stats  at us.  You know what you've  got me scared to do?  Drive home and take a bath.  I'm petrified now.  I think with that analogy  about his daughter  wearing the helmet  when she goes biking  that means it's fine  that you walk  around your house  with a gun.  Well,  because that's what he does.  I do like my guns.  But it takes the,  like,  I know flying  is a lot safer.  I do know that  but I will drive  over flying  every single time  if I can  because it just  relieves that stress 
[02:54:30]  and anxiety  I feel leading up  to my flight.  I think people  feel safer too  because A,  you're in control  of the vehicle.  Right.  You always feel like  you can kind of  weave your way  out of any kind  of accident  that might come up.  You're not going  to plummet.  That's always nice.  Plummeting is never good.  And,  I don't know,  some Muslim extremist  isn't going to pop up  in your back seat  and bash his way  into your driving, 
[02:55:00]  behind your steering wheel  and do something horrible.  Well,  let me ask you this.  How many Americans  were killed  in the United States  by terrorists,  international terrorists  last year?  by Muslim extremist terrorists.  Yeah,  I know.  How many Americans  were killed  on American roads  last year?  More than 40,000.  Yeah.  You know,  we lose 40,000  every year?  Yeah,  on the roads.  That is amazing.  Just lost one  on the expressway  this morning.  Yep.  Cost me a lot of time  to get in.  Yep.  We really care,  don't we,  as people.  And now,  to go back  to the psychology,  you know,  you mentioned control. 
[02:55:30]  Well,  first of all,  you said,  you know,  you always have this feeling,  oh,  if I get into trouble,  I can just drive  my way out of it,  right?  Why?  Because I'm a better driver  than everybody else.  You know what?  You know what psychologists  have shown?  There's something,  it's optimism bias.  It's called optimism bias.  If you ask people,  how good looking are you?  And they'll say,  better than average.  And they'll say,  how truthful are you?  Better than average.  And so on.  And we think,  everybody's better than average,  right?  Which, of course,  is a statistical impossibility.  And that's part,  and so basically,  it's part,  you know,  for a lot of folks,  this idea that somehow  I'm a better driver  than everybody else 
[02:56:00]  is actually an illusion.  Okay?  And it's a dangerous illusion.  Again,  to go back  now another reason why,  control actually does matter,  this illusion of control.  But more than that,  it's familiarity.  Familiarity is one of the  most important factors  in risk perception.  If something is novel,  new,  strange,  your intuitive sense,  which is to say,  the sense that comes  from your unconscious mind,  it drives that risk perception  right up.  Hey,  I've never seen this before.  Back off.  But if it's familiar,  it drives it right down.  There's no threat here.  Which is a big reason  why smokers continue to smoke. 
[02:56:30]  Because they don't have,  partly it's nicotine addiction,  obviously,  but it's because  they don't have  an intuitive sense  that the cigarette's  a threat.  Day after day  after day  after day,  they've smoked  and nothing bad happened.  In fact,  it makes them feel  pretty good.  So the unconscious mind  says,  sorry,  there's no threat here.  Don't worry about it.  It's familiar.  It's beyond familiar.  You know,  chain smokers,  sometimes they won't even realize  there's a cigarette  in their hands,  right?  That's the unconscious mind.  That's the brain  saying,  there's no threat here.  Ignore it.  Wow. 
[02:57:00]  So what do you do  with all,  we're inundated every day  with just horrible images  on the news  and fear  and like I said,  the teases of death  and destruction  at your doorstep  and in your house,  products you buy.  What do you do?  How do you deal with that  logically?  Well,  you pick up a copy  of The Science of Fear  by Daniel Gardner.  why we fear  the things we shouldn't  and put ourselves  in greater danger.  That's what you do.  Published by Dutton,  available everywhere.  That's what you do.  That's a brilliant idea. 
[02:57:30]  You educate yourself  on the whole thing  by buying his book.  Silly me.  I thought we were  just having a conversation.  Thank you for putting  that so shamelessly.  I'll put it  a little more casually.  Look,  what you have to do  is you have to learn  a little bit  about the psychology  because you have to realize  that every single human being  is subject  to certain psychological foibles  which can make you  get risk really wrong.  You'll fear things  that you shouldn't fear  and you won't fear  things that you should fear.  And the second thing 
[02:58:00]  is you have to realize  that you have this business  of the two minds,  the conscious mind  and the unconscious mind.  You have to get in the habit  of thinking  about your intuitions.  What psychologists have found  is that when you have  a strong intuition  that something is true,  you won't examine it.  This is true for educated  and intelligent people,  people who think that,  you know,  they're too clever  for this stuff.  Not true.  This is a natural way  of dealing with things.  If we have a strong intuition  that something is true,  we'll just go with our gut.  You have to get in the habit  of saying to yourself,  you know what,  I have time.  I'm afraid to fly.  I think I'm going to drive instead. 
[02:58:30]  Does that make sense?  I have the feeling  that it makes sense,  but does it really make sense?  I'm going to go  and get some statistics  and I'm going to think  about this rationally.  You have to get into  that habit of skepticism.  Do that and you can  catch these mistakes.  Right on.  Hey, let's go to the phones.  We've got John  in New York here.  John, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, there, Jim.  I just was,  I want to tell you  that one day  at the Verrazano  narrow bridge over there,  you know, in New York,  goes over the port of New York.  I'm driving. 
[02:59:00]  I've been over it  a hundred times.  One day,  I'm going up the ramp  and I'm sitting there  and I had a severe panic attack.  I started sweating.  Almost blacked out.  I'm driving.  Get over the bridge.  Finally get over it.  I'm like,  what the hell  was that all about?  So then I started thinking,  driven over it many times.  Then I started thinking  it was right after  the Minnesota bridge collapse  and the media  just over and over  showed the cars  plummeted into the river,  the bridge collapsing.  And I just,  it's something that  I cannot get out of my mind. 
[02:59:30]  Fezzy?  That's you?  Yeah, no kidding.  Yeah, the media  will do that to you.  It's just absolutely amazing.  Absolutely.  This goes right  with what Daniel's saying here.  Yeah, it's those horrible images.  One of the most basic ways  the unconscious mind  decides,  how likely is it  this is going to happen?  You're driving over the bridge  and you're saying to yourself,  how likely is it  that I'm going to plunge  to my death?  One of the ways  the unconscious mind  answers that question  is it uses these things  called heuristics,  which are just rules of thumb.  One of those is 
[03:00:00]  what I call in the book  the example rule.  You will,  unconsciously again,  you won't be aware  that this process is happening.  You will try to think  of an example of it.  And the easier it is  to think of an example,  not how many examples  you can think of,  but the easier it is  for you to think of an example  the more common that thing is.  And so if last night  you saw on the news  these vivid images  of this frightening,  awful event,  and then you ask yourself  and then you're in  the same situation,  your unconscious mind  is going to say,  how easy is it for me  to think of an example  of this horrible thing 
[03:00:30]  happening?  Incredibly easily.  I just saw it  in vivid color, right?  And so that's where  it comes from.  You know,  the stranger abduction thing  that I referred to earlier.  This is why you're seeing  it all across the Western world.  One of the biggest news stories.  Only if they're cute kids,  by the way.  Only if they're,  exactly.  Cute little blonde kids.  Yeah.  We don't care about  the ugly ones.  Exactly.  But these things  get picked up.  And so,  you know,  they happen,  but they're incredibly,  incredibly rare.  And so you get a story  like a child's abducted  in Germany.  It's a true story. 
[03:01:00]  This child is abducted  in Germany  and then there's  closed circuit camera images  of this abduction  and the kid is murdered.  This is international news,  right?  Your conscious mind  understands perfectly well  this says nothing  about the safety  of your children  here in the United States.  Right.  But that's not how  your unconscious mind  processes that information.  And here's the thing.  It would be tough  for you to rewire  your brain  to think differently  when it comes  to all this stuff,  but what the big sin is  is the fact that  the media knows  that the average person  thinks this way  and they take advantage 
[03:01:30]  of it for ratings  and revenue  and whatnot.  Okay.  You want to discuss  that a little bit?  Here's where I'm going  to disagree slightly.  To some extent  that's true.  You know,  there's no question.  There's lots of individuals  and organizations  who profit from  the promotion of fear  and there's no question  that the media  are among them.  But I think there's  actually something  more profound going on.  Why is it that the media  always grab the sensational,  the dramatic,  the, you know,  the whatever type of story  and at the same time  they don't tell you  the statistics,  they don't tell you  diabetes, asthma, 
[03:02:00]  these things kill people  by the tens of thousands.  You never see stories  about them.  So why is it that  they do what they do?  I argue in the book  that it's about  evolutionary psychology.  Evolutionary psychologists  say that we are  hardwired for stories.  We like telling stories.  We like hearing stories.  We have no similar  hardwiring for numbers.  Numbers have no  emotional content.  They don't move us.  We have no intuitive  grasp of numbers.  Okay.  So, but what's a story  exactly?  Whether it's the evening news  or you're talking  about a Hollywood movie  or a novel  or Shakespeare  or the Bible  or whatever,  a story is always 
[03:02:30]  the same thing.  It's about individual  identifiable people.  It's about,  it's got novelty.  It's a little bit different.  It's got drama  and conflict  and big emotions.  And the more  it has those qualities,  the better the story is,  right?  So, for instance,  Christina Applegate,  36 years old,  gets breast cancer.  We all know her.  She's good to look at.  She's, you know,  a young woman,  so this is particularly tragic.  This is a particularly  powerful emotional story.  So, of course,  this is international news  all over the world. 
[03:03:00]  Well, guess what?  The average woman  who gets breast cancer  is in her 70s or 80s.  That's when breast cancer risk  is as highest  as actually when a woman  is in her senior years,  not when she's in her 30s  and 40s.  But why is it,  as media analyses have shown,  why is it that the media  are always showing women  in their 30s or 40s  who get breast cancer  and they never show  old women who get breast cancer?  Makes a better story.  I get all that.  Makes a better story.  But then they don't tell you  how severe the cancer is  because they want you to think,  oh, this could be it  for Christina Applegate. 
[03:03:30]  That's the problem  I'm getting at.  Yeah.  It's like,  if you read a little deeper  what you have to do  on your own  because they're not  going to do it for you,  it turns out that  this is very curable  in her case.  But most people still  don't know that  because the news  isn't willing to offer up  that info to you.  And that's where  I really think they do it  for the ratings  and money.  Well, you know,  again...  Because they could tag  all these stories with,  wow, this is a great story,  but let me tell you,  this is ridiculously rare.  But never underestimate 
[03:04:00]  the power of ignorance  as an explanation.  I hate to say it that way,  but it's true.  I've known a lot of reporters  and a lot of editors  in my time,  and their scientific knowledge  in a lot of cases  is just appalling.  You know,  public misconceptions,  if the public has  a scientific misconception,  there's a real good chance  that reporters share  that misconception.  So they're repeating it  not necessarily because  they want to juice the story,  but because they don't  know any better.  We make fun of the local news 
[03:04:30]  all the time.  And growing up,  I thought,  wow, they have to be scholars,  these people.  They're giving us the news.  Just reading.  And you realize  they're just a bunch of dopes  like we are watching  the damn thing.  Reading off the teleprompter  and just kind of...  Just going with it  and assuming what they're  about to read is real  and that someone proofread it  and checked their facts.  No.  And we love the local tie-in  to any story,  any horrible story.  No matter where it is  in the world,  they will try to somehow  localize it.  Could it happen here? 
[03:05:00]  We'll let you know.  And that's another tactic that...  Oh, that was after  the Indian Ocean tsunami.  That was my favorite.  Yeah.  Could a tsunami happen  in Saskatchewan?  We'll tell you  at 5 o'clock.  They were showing  graphics,  computer graphics,  computer images,  CGI,  of what New York City  would look like  if it was hit  by a tsunami.  You're kidding.  Now, there was  no reason to show that,  but they were showing it  and they were like,  here's what it would look like.  Yeah. 
[03:05:30]  But it's just there  to shake you up  a little bit.  Even better than  what Anthony was just saying.  They're talking about  global warming and all that  and how the ice caps  are going to melt  and New York City  is going to be underwater,  right?  So they show what  that's going to look like  with cars actually floating  in the middle of Broadway  and subway stations  completely flooded.  Like, we wouldn't figure  this out as it's going on.  Would we attempt  to build a big wall?  What would we do?  We wouldn't just sit there...  Well, the last resort  would be to probably  get your car out  of the city.  when the water's 
[03:06:00]  maybe two inches high.  It's almost like...  You know, it's not  going to happen instantly.  They're basically saying  that we see a puddle  that doesn't look  too normal  and it's getting bigger  slowly, but surely...  And we still sit there  and do nothing.  The global warming thing  is just the latest  in the real kind of  let's scare the crap  out of everybody.  Running out of oil,  that's another thing.  People love to jump on that one.  Hey, we're running out.  There's just none  going to be left.  And then they paint 
[03:06:30]  this picture of us  going back to some  covered wagon scenario.  And it's all just based  in let's scare these people  so they watch the news.  It's amazing.  In large part.  In large part.  Yeah, no, I have to agree.  And it's not even  just the news, right?  I mean, go into the bookstore.  Now, here I am.  I'm selling a book  which I'm trying to...  Oh, what book is that?  Daniel Gardner?  It's The Science of Fear.  It's an excellent book.  But, you know,  for every one book like mine,  you're going to find  a hundred others 
[03:07:00]  that are going to tell you  how you're going to die.  You know, here's how  the world's going to end  in the next five years.  I mean, catastrophe  is like big business.  Because those books  make a better story.  Exactly.  They make a better story.  It's that simple.  You know, like climate change  and flooding is a good story.  Because if you look  at the actual science,  what the actual scientists  are saying,  they're talking about  incremental rises  which are measured  in centimeters  over decades.  That was the point  we were making  about Manhattan  being underwater.  It's absurd.  We're going to have  a lot of time 
[03:07:30]  to try to figure it out.  And if we can't figure it out,  guess what?  We're going to have  a lot of time  to get the fuck off this island.  Let's say hi to John  in North Carolina.  Hey, I just wanted to say  a perfect example  of this deal  was with Y2K.  I mean, that was  just a perfect storm.  There was a definite  time stamp  of when it was going  to happen, you know?  People went out  and bought supplies  and oh, they were  waiting in their homes  just waiting for midnight  for a complete anarchy  to happen  for the Y2K.  And they weren't sure  if the missiles 
[03:08:00]  were going to launch  because of the coding  or whatever the hell  they said.  It got so bad  and then Happy New Year  and nothing happened.  Not one problem.  And there were crickets  outside your house.  At our New Year's Eve party,  we went outside  and cut the power  to the house  at midnight.  Everybody freaked out.  Yeah.  That's pretty funny.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  One of our favorite  things to do  is collect news teases.  And a bunch of people  are suggesting  we play a few of these 
[03:08:30]  for you.  Yeah.  As far as, you know,  the culture of fear,  the science of fear.  It is a good example.  The name of your book.  Your book here.  We collect the best  of the best.  So listen,  listen to a few of these.  One city wants to pack  all their sex offenders  into a three block area.  Problem is,  it could be right  next to your house.  All the sex offenders  in three blocks  could be next to your house.  Yeah.  Hmm.  All right.  Yeah.  You got to admit,  they're kind of trying  to shake you up. 
[03:09:00]  They want you to tune in  that night and see  where the hell  those sex offenders are.  I say point for me,  sir.  Yeah.  I have to concede that one.  I concede that one.  Fear mongering going on there.  That's pure ratings.  Yep.  Yeah.  Okay.  Good.  How about this one?  How a twist on the predator law  could shut down religion.  I love playing these.  Shut down religion.  Like, religion's been around  for, you know,  thousands of years.  Yeah.  This one dumb thing  is going to shut it down  for everybody.  Man was barking at the moon. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  That's religion.  This one is beautiful.  Could frequent hiccups  be a sign of cancer?  Watch New Day to 10.  These are real.  That is,  how do you watch that?  I go, what?  Oh my God.  Frequent hiccups.  A sign of cancer?  Yeah.  Meanwhile, you're hiccuping  waiting for 11 o'clock  biting your fingernails off.  Yeah.  And they know  that you're tuning in  but they're going to get to it  after sports  after you watch  for 28 minutes.  I love this stuff. 
[03:10:00]  Are you normal?  Thursday at 11  on News 8.  What does that even mean?  Are you normal?  Are you normal?  Are you normal?  I'm from The Simpsons.  I know.  Doesn't it sound like  these can't possibly be real?  But man,  they are.  I'm keeping track.  No points for you.  It's a shutout so far.  I love these.  The problem solvers  have uncovered  sexual predators  sent to live  in our nursing homes.  Do you really know  who's living down the hall? 
[03:10:30]  Could this happen  to your mother?  Yeah.  Dare to dream, mom.  Yeah.  We're almost done here.  The problem solvers  could your house  be making you fat?  Tomorrow,  CBS 2 News at 5.  How do they not just  crack up tape of these?  Your house be making you fat.  Oh, boy.  And the ingredients  in shampoo  that can make a boy  develop breasts.  Tonight at 10. 
[03:11:00]  This is like  Kentucky Fried Movie stuff.  Yeah.  This is real news teasers.  It's like if you're a father,  you're checking out  what shampoo that is  so your son's not getting  beat up in school.  Yeah.  And finally,  fondled.  Sex offenders  may be in your house.  And I love it.  Take a look around.  Check those closets.  That's truly amazing.  Actually, you know,  I have a simple rule of thumb.  It didn't,  I was convinced  this phrase  was going to pop up.  Danger lurks.  Anytime you hear 
[03:11:30]  a news story  in which you hear  the phrase  danger lurks,  don't pay any attention.  Danger lurks.  The one they do a lot,  a popular toy  that your kid  is playing with  could be very dangerous  to their health.  Could be dangerous.  And we always say,  why don't you  give the parents a break  and tell them the toy  right away?  No, they'll just say,  is your child  playing with it now?  Now in the other room?  We'll tell you  what toy at 11  and it's like  two in the afternoon  and you're like,  I gotta wait nine hours?  Lock the kid  in his closet  and don't let him  play with anything.  But it is 
[03:12:00]  just pure,  pure fear of mind.  Yeah, let's go with  Zach in Colorado.  Zach, what's up?  Hey man,  I was just gonna  tell you guys,  the oil scare thing  that we have right now,  it drives me nuts.  Out here in western Colorado,  we got more oil  than fucking Saudi Arabia.  But no one wants  to drill it.  And so they're telling  everyone we're running  out of oil  and it's fucking  sitting right  underneath our feet.  Really?  Really.  Really, Jed Clampett?  How do you know for sure?  Well, he was hunting 
[03:12:30]  for some food  and up from the ground  came a bubble in crude.  I believe.  Let's say hi  to Chuck in Cleveland.  Chuck.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey man.  Good, Chuck.  Hey, you know,  I got a real problem  out here.  I'm a dog trainer  and what we have  is every time  we have a vicious  dog attack,  if it's a German Shepherd  or something else  that goes completely  unnoticed,  if it's anything  that looks anything  like a pit bull,  it gets media attention 
[03:13:00]  all over the place  and we have  such a high  foreclosure rate  and some other  issues going on  in Cleveland  that we just get  an influx of dogs  in the pound  and they're not,  our laws say  we're not allowed  to take dogs  out of the pound  if they're pit bulls  and so it's just  the media really  causes a big problem  and if you look  at the statistics  on these dog bites  there is the pit bull  or what they call  a pit bull  which is six different  breeds of dogs  it's very, very low  in comparison  to any other breed  or any other incident 
[03:13:30]  with child fatality  or whatever  but the media  really does disservice  to a lot of  great family dogs  and just people  who want to have  a particular dog  and they just end up  in the pound  getting euthanized  without any chance  of adoption  so I think  it's really a disservice  by the media  to do that to us  Yeah, listen  one of the biggest  and most important concepts  I think to come out  of cognitive psychology  is something called  confirmation bias  once we believe  something  this is true of everybody  once we believe something  we embrace information 
[03:14:00]  that supports that belief  and we tend to belittle  or ignore information  and dispute that belief  well if you look at  the way the media behave  in fact it's one giant  ball of confirmation bias  because once they believe  something is true  once you have an established  narrative  and pitbulls  are a classic example  stories that support  that narrative  they go to the front  of the line  stories that are contrary  to that narrative  they get ignored  same thing happened  with terrorism  remember after the  Oklahoma City bombing  the standard narrative  on terrorism 
[03:14:30]  was angry white guy  and militia  right  and we had endless  numbers of stories  about angry white guys  and militias  then along comes 9-11  the narrative changes  and now it's about  Islamic nut bars  right  well guess what happened  in the last couple of years  there have actually been  incidents including one  in Oklahoma  in which a man  a suicide bomber  blew himself up  outside a football stadium  not carried anywhere  not reported anywhere  why not  because it was an angry  white guy  oh  yeah  not a Muslim 
[03:15:00]  it didn't fit the narrative  and so it wasn't reported  if it had happened in 1998  it would have been  international news  right  thanks guys  alright sir  thank you  oh yeah  this is a great one  we love this one too  Paul in Michigan  good morning guys  how are you  pretty good  man  alright  have you ever noticed  that every single time  somebody shoots up  a mall or a store  and at some point  mentions a video game  the media just explodes  with this  you know  is violent video games 
[03:15:30]  messing up your children  it's an epidemic  whenever anything  involving video games  is mentioned  and the media  just clamps  right onto it  but if you look  and see how many  people play video games  and how many  actually act them out  and kill somebody  or injure somebody  yeah  it's ridiculous  yeah  it is ridiculous  the media ignores  the fact that  playing a lot  of these video games  are a stress release  for a lot of people  instead of going out  and punching someone  in the head  you kind of get that  out of your system 
[03:16:00]  playing some of these games  right  yeah absolutely  yeah  and it's whenever  Grand Theft Auto  Grand Theft Auto  is always the first game  to come up  and it's always  you know  is it going to make you  walk outside  and punch somebody  in the face  it's just  it's more of this  scaremongering  and I think people  are actually finally  starting to get  you know  wind of the fact  that they're just  BSing for ratings  and killing time  when really  they should be  focusing on a real story  well one of the worst  examples of this  is what happened  after the Columbine massacre  you remember that  atmosphere  everyone was going crazy  you know  school violence  is out of control 
[03:16:30]  what's wrong  with America's kids  and everyone  had their pet theories  like it was goth music  remember goth music  and goth culture  yeah  you know it was  going to destroy America  they blamed it  on Marilyn Manson  didn't they  yeah Marilyn Manson  it was  and then they went  down the list  or it was drugs  it was pot  or whatever  you know right  you just go down the list  here's the crazy thing  you know what was  actually happening  at that time  you know what the  statistics actually showed  the statistics showed  that first of all  the chance of any  one American child  being hurt  in school  or killed  murdered in school  was infinitesimal  in fact schools 
[03:17:00]  were the safest place  for Americans kids  and guess what  the trend was  in violence  it wasn't going  through the roof  in fact it was  just the opposite  it was dropping  down through the basement  but nobody talked  about that  the media didn't  talk about that  the politicians  didn't talk about that  but those were the facts  wow  let's go to Al  in Maryland  Al what's up  hey guys  fascinating talk today  I'm definitely  picking up the  science of fear  for my vacation  read next week  so  my problem is  motorcycle  I have one 
[03:17:30]  joyride  that my wife  just recently  decided she did  not want to ride  it  is there any way  to help her  get past this  can I  you're a motorcycle  motorcycle guy  you said  yes  yeah  I  got 3,000  safe miles  on my bike  my wife  recently decided  that's it for her  my daughter  had a wreck  I guess she's got  confirmation bias  as you pointed out  a little while ago  but beyond time  is there a way  she can get past  this fear  the only knowledge  the only knowledge  I have on this  whole thing  was when we  were broadcasting  from the X Games 
[03:18:00]  in LA  and we were  talking to all  the motocross  guys  and they were  doing some  ridiculous things  on their bikes  like all the  tricks in the air  and you know  the racing  they do  and all that  we asked  every single  guy if they  ride  when they're  not performing  on the street  and they actually  told us over  and over again  I'm not crazy  enough to ride  a motorcycle  on the highways  I'm sorry  I'm saying that  Al  but that always  pops in my head  when we talk  motorcycles  these guys  are like  fuck no 
[03:18:30]  I know what  I'm doing  when I'm on a  track with these  guys  but I don't  trust the average  American driving  their dumb  minivan  or what have you  people make a  left in front of  me and I have  an escalade  and they don't  see me  my reality is  I drive about  60 to 70  thousand miles  a year for work  so my chance  of getting killed  is far greater  I believe  in my car  than on my bike  and I think  riding the bike  makes me safer  I'm not going to  argue that  I'm sorry I brought  that up  because that's not 
[03:19:00]  going to help you  but I'm sure  with everything else  Daniel's telling us  today the stats  have got to be  ridiculous compared  to the reality  of it  well that didn't  really make sense  but you know  what I was trying  to say  riding a motorcycle  is mile for mile  more dangerous  than driving in a car  no surprise  there  but if you  really figure  out how many  guys are on  bikes and how  many actually  are dying  riding a bike  the stats are  ridiculous  I don't know  what the exact  numbers are  but what you 
[03:19:30]  have to do  is you have  to look at  those numbers  and you have  to decide  for yourself  is this a risk  I'm prepared  to take  right Danny  well I just  started riding  so this is  kind of interesting  to me  but what I've  noticed so far  is that the  people that ride  erratically are  typically the ones  who have scratches  on the side of  their bike  because they  dropped it  they're the  ones that are  what's called  lane splitting  when they're  in between  two lanes  of cars  those are the  people that  most likely  get into  these accidents  me I drive  like a big  pussy  because I know  how dangerous  it is  so I sit  there  I don't  weave in and 
[03:20:00]  out of traffic  I just drive  on my bike  like I would  drive if I  was in my car  but you're  new at it  too  so in time  you'll start  pulling those  shenanigans  those are the  people where I  see videos on  all the  disgusting sites  that I go to  those are always  the guys  where the end  photo is just  a guy's head  looking like  hamburger meat  and it's just  like well  that's not  going to be  me  when I see  sport bikes  whizzing past  me doing 90  on a side  street  I'm like  well you could  die  you'll be the  guy in the  paper tomorrow  not me  how about the  guys doing  the wheelies  oh my god 
[03:20:30]  that's never  reported in the  news it's  always you  know 26  year old  blah blah  with four  kids died  today and  you picture  a guy going  55 miles an  hour to work  on his  motorcycle  every summer  there's always  a new roadside  memorial on a  major intersection  in my neighborhood  where it's  flowers and  candles because  some idiot  on a bike  figured he was  going to speed  up through a  yellow and  it's like you  want to do  that in a  car fine you'll  get t-boned  but chances  are you're  going to live  through it  you get t-boned  on a bike  there's no 
[03:21:00]  saving you  I don't care  what kind of  helmet you're  wearing you're  dead  yeah I guess  Al if I  learned anything  from Daniel  today is  you know show  your girl the  stats  yeah I've got  30,000 safe  miles on a  scratch free  bike so I  guess that's a  good point  you're one of  the lucky ones  that's right  and I apologize  to all the  riders  I'd never get  on a bike  I apologize to  all the riders  out there because  now they're  calling like  crazy riding  a motorcycle is  safe and blah  blah blah  I just remember  what the motocross  guys told us 
[03:21:30]  that's all  so hey Daniel  before we let  you go  the science  of fear  it's in  bookstores now  I noticed a  chapter I don't  know how much  you want to say  about it because  I know you want  people to pick up  the book but  the title of the  chapter was kind  of interesting to  me something  about where's the  chapters now  sorry  let's wait  Sophie thumbs  through the book  there's never  been a better  time to be  alive  what's that  about  absolutely  this is the  most basic  fact going  when it comes  to risk 
[03:22:00]  we are the  healthiest and  safest people  who ever lived  this is the  crazy thing  this is actually  the paradox  of the center  of my book  we live in  societies where  we're increasingly  worried about  threats to health  and safety  but guess what  no one seems to  be aware of  or appreciative of  the fact that  we're the  healthiest and  safest people  who ever lived  you know what  the child mortality  rate was in the  United States  100 years ago  almost one in  five almost one  in five American  children died  before the age of  five now it's  it's much less  than 1% today  you know life 
[03:22:30]  expectancy down  through the  centuries it goes  up a little bit  it goes down  a little bit  never really  advances right  then in the  last 100 years  what happens  it goes from  50 to 80  we are incredibly  lucky to be  alive today  if you look at  the things that  killed Americans  100 years ago  you know what  the number one  killer was  tuberculosis  was the number  one cause of  death  got the  consumption  exactly  tuberculosis  diphtheria  you know polio  all these things  have been wiped  out  all these threats  good old diseases  and you know  we're worried  about these  you know 
[03:23:00]  stranger abduction  and then you  know what  chemical in the  toys that our  kids are playing  with and all  these trivial  things relatively  trivial  so why does the  media report  it differently  like everything  causes cancer  and like you  said there's  this in the  toy that could  kill you  because good  news is no  news  it's that  simple  because good  news is very  hard to tell  it's one of  the remember  i talked about  stories is but  you know something  happened to this  person and it's an  emotional story  how do you tell  the emotionally  gripping story of a  man not murdered  how do you tell  the emotionally  gripping story of a 
[03:23:30]  woman who doesn't  die of diphtheria  or a child who's  not dead  you know  yeah  we talk to the  family of the  man that just  goes to work  every day  it's kind of  like well  kind of boring  yeah  we just got to  educate ourselves  a little more  well uh  daniel garner is a  pleasure the  science of fear  why we fear the  things we shouldn't  and put ourselves  in great greater  danger  i find that subject  very very interesting  it's great  well thanks guys  it was a blast  right on  all right  we're gonna take  a quick break  and we're gonna 
[03:24:00]  finish up next  stay there  all right  uh jim brewer's  gonna be on the  show this week  i just found out  awesome  he was our big  surprise at the  comedy show this  past saturday  yeah did a great  job taking the  place of uh  jimmy fallon  who was gonna be  uh who was going  to be the big  surprise but he  got scared of our  audience that's what  i'm hearing he got  a little scared  that's what i'm  hearing and mike  berbiglia is gonna  come in tomorrow  and defend himself  so all right 
[03:24:30]  that should be a  lot of fun  booyah  booyah  booyah  come on let's all  pull our nuts out  of an asshole  and go booyah  people liked that  last segment  yeah  they liked it a  lot he was uh  he was uh  he was good  he was very good  it's something we  address on the show  a lot  yes  we got this  that just came in  from derrick  here at the opian  anthony show  we realize that not  every radio program  has had the same  success that we've  had so we'd like  to take this time  and rub it in 
[03:25:00]  do you know what  we've done with  our careers  jackass  when were you on  Leno  when were you on  Letterman  when did you guys  do a comedy show  in front of 10,000  people  why don't you answer  some of those  questions  are you a syndicated  show across America  on satellite radio  our careers are what  they are  we've done very well  for ourselves  and you know that  go do your stupid  show and leave us  out of it  you pussies  thank you  you can now go back  to living your shitty  everyday lives  awkward 
[03:25:30]  it's always awkward  the next day  at the time  it makes complete  sense to be  a raging asshole  then the next day  you're like  ugh  I don't ever  want to hear that  again  I can't believe  my car's fucked up  I gotta  I hear you  no I gotta  oh your car  how would it  work out  how did that  work out with yours  was it a thrown  rod or something  or a lifter  what  very long story  short  my car was fine  let a friend of  mine drive my car  now car isn't  fine  so I bring it  to a mechanic 
[03:26:00]  when the low oil  light was on  or something  his buddy's  driving it  and it's a stick  shift  and he's like  what did he say  he's like  oh your car's got  pretty good pickup  for a four cylinder  and I look  and I'm like  yeah that's cause  you're doing 75  in third gear  he's 75  in third gear  so now there's  a problem with the  car  clang clang  clang clang  yeah and so  it's my fault  because the oil  was low  as opposed to  him driving it  like a retard  so I bring it  you didn't tell  me there was  a blind spot  so I bring it  to the mechanic 
[03:26:30]  and the guy's  you know he calls  the senior mechanic  over to take a listen  to it and the guy  just goes  I see his face  I'm like oh boy  so I get out of the car  I shut the engine off  and I say to the guy  so what is it  he goes  connecting rods  are just done  they're just done  so I'm just standing  there no one's  saying anything  I was like  well what do you  suggest I do  he goes  you should probably  buy a new car  yeah  should probably  buy a new car  that's like  it's dead  it's done  it's dead  the car doesn't  even have 60,000 miles  on it  it's finished 
[03:27:00]  so now I'm in the market  for a new vehicle  wow  anybody out there  selling one  that sucks  hey Sam just came in  and I know what he's  doing here  he needs help  with his contest  what happened  I'm starting to panic  this is your baby  right  listen  this is all yours  they gave me four days  and said yeah  let's just do this contest  and tomorrow's Thursday  in fairness  this should have been  a couple weeks  yeah  yeah

[03:34:00]  of the  Indian  and Bliss  brah  and I come in  for that  crash landing  into the  Canseco  Fieldhouse  holy shit  marble mouth  ass  so what you  gonna do  it's Hulk Hogan  it is like  a Hulk Hogan  it's OPD  dude  one psycho  dude  thank you  James  Richo  now these  guys  are becoming  wise asses  he writes  will we get  yelled at  for booing  Flea Man 
[03:34:30]  no  now we got  a dilemma  no you can  boo Flea Man  look we're in  a tough spot  with the booing  what can I tell  you  so you can't  boo Flea Man  if you guys  want to continue  booing comedians  then we're not  gonna have any  more comedy shows  that is our  dilemma  we don't know  what to do  we don't know  what to do  it's kind of  a catch  what do they  call it  catch 38  yeah there's a  little catch 22  happening here  the reason we're  telling people  not to boo  the newer comics  before you give 
[03:35:00]  them a chance  is because  we can't do  any more shows  if you don't  so what do we  do  but we boo Flea  because we know  Flea's an asshole  but do we do  just beach days  and camping trips  and give up  on the comedy shows  yeah fun stuff  things that don't  take applause  that's our catch 22  we don't know  what to do  because guys do  not want to do  the show  because they're  a bit scared  and the list  of people that  didn't want to be  part of the show  this year  pretty amazing  pretty amazing  you want to do  one more  before line of the day 
[03:35:30]  sure  Luke  New Hampshire  what's up  Luke  hey  yeah  I had a little  idea here  okay  you know  past couple  years  I've been  doing some  wrestling  kind of on  the weekend  and you know  right off the  cuff  I could probably  cut a better  promo against  Sam  than most  anyone out  who's even  tried this  so far  so here we  go  Sam  you stupid  little  gnat  with bad  hair  you wish 
[03:36:00]  that you  could go  SummerSlam  and step  into the ring  with me  but the fact  of the matter  is I am  just better  than you  and each  and every  way  imaginable  as sure  as it is  that Ron  and Fez  noon to  three is  live  it is sure  that I will  go and break  you apart  limb from  limb  and break  every bone  in your  disgusting  little body  you are  nothing
