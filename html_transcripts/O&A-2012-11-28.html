<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a crude and profane morning show intro involving Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  Their banter centered on Steve-O's previous day's appearance, focusing on his voice issues and recounting his extreme stunts, including a recent sober tattoo.  Other guests mentioned were Who Kid and Ray Liotta.  A significant portion focused on their frustration with producer Iraq, accusing him of political correctness and a lack of engagement in the show's irreverent style, employing offensive language in their critique.  The lack of available Ralphie May clips was also a point of contention.  The ensuing discussion delved into Ralphie May's recent Twitter feud with Anthony, stemming from criticisms of May's comedic style, with the hosts reading aloud from May's angry tweets.  This was juxtaposed with a discussion about the death of Marvin Miller and the poor performance of the Two and a Half Men actor in recent seasons. The show briefly touched on upcoming segments featuring Patrice O’Neal and a jingle contest, speculated about winning the Powerball lottery, and mentioned a 70-year-old karate sensei training one of their associates.

The show then briefly dismissed the hardships faced by taxi drivers before pivoting to a discussion about the $500 million Powerball jackpot, debating the after-tax implications of lump-sum versus annuity payments and launching into a rant about excessive taxation and government spending.  This included a host mentioning a Twitter argument with a CEO who viewed taxes as "giving back."  The conversation further touched on misleading Black Friday sales figures and proposed solutions to the national debt, including military spending cuts and infrastructure investments.  A sharp turn then occurred towards Bill Clinton's alleged affair with Jennifer Flowers, focusing on details from a recent interview, including Clinton's proposed visit in a hoodie to avoid detection.  This transitioned into a discussion, replete with vulgar and misogynistic language, of the "top ten hottest presidential wives and mistresses," analyzing photos and making crude commentary on their physical attributes.  A call from a Tennessee listener discussing their Dollywood visit led to further commentary on the park and Dolly Parton, including a comparison of Parton's "Jolene" with The White Stripes' cover.

A considerable portion of the show featured listener calls and discussions about Dolly Parton, her life, and Dollywood, debating the accuracy of various claims about her.  A caller shared anecdotes about working on Parton's home, detailing her reclusive behavior.  Discussions of other theme parks followed, including a listener's negative Dollywood water park experience.  Listener complaints about the show's decline in quality, particularly its self-referentiality, were addressed with both criticism and support from callers.  A crucial call from Ralphie May followed, discussing his recent rehab stay, struggles with PTSD stemming from childhood physical and sexual abuse, and his apology for his previous Twitter spat with Anthony.  Jim Norton's presence in the studio was noted, although he didn’t participate in this particular segment. E-Rock provided some audio bits.

A later phone call with Ralphie May involved an apology, discussions of AA meetings versus Al-Anon, past heroin use, and reminiscing about past show antics, including the "Toothpick Guy" incident and a mustard-in-hair street encounter.  The anniversary of Patrice O'Neal's death was discussed, along with conflicting information about the date.  Audio from the attorney of an Elmo accuser was played, detailing graphic sexual encounters, followed by speculation about a Brazilian elevator prank video.  Ralphie May's suggestion that Black people be exempt from federal income tax was also a topic, alongside discussions of upcoming show events, including a Patrice O'Neal special, tour dates, and a James Randi podcast segment.  Difficulties scheduling a meeting with their boss and listener feedback were discussed.  A brief interaction with Stanley T concluded this part.


The show continued with rambling conversations about pre-1991 gangster rap, including explicit sexual and violent references, and disbelief at Ice Cube attending art school.  A caller, "Sanity," requested help obtaining One Direction tickets, leading to discussions about ticket acquisition strategies using vulgar language.  A heated exchange ensued between a caller, Greg from New Hampshire, and production members Danny and Travis, escalating into personal insults, threats, and repeated use of homophobic slurs, with Danny revealing he'd called Greg multiple times after their initial altercation. The show abruptly transitioned to the "After ONA Live" segment with Sam Roberts, with Opie and Anthony leaving the studio.  Sam Roberts' segment included a book giveaway and further discussion of the Greg-Danny-Travis altercation, along with calls from listeners, some expressing support and others engaging in aggressive banter.  Explicit language and sexually suggestive remarks were made.  A lengthy and sexually explicit phone call with a female caller, Catherine, concluded the segment, ending with Catherine being promised a book and the show’s closing moments mentioning Sal’s absence due to a questioned illness.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, I'm Christopher Lloyd, and I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's a weekly morning, approximately 6 a.m., and this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second. 
[00:00:30]  Someone said we curse a lot, do we? I have no idea if we do.  So, glad you didn't.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it stopped.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah! 
[00:01:00]  Rules are destroyed.  And convention burns the ground.  Would you like to make some fucking second?  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted.  Tired of these people.  Up my ass all the time, trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender. 
[00:01:30]  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  This old gag.  All right.  Good morning.  Happy hump day.  Are people actually bitching about the intro? 
[00:02:00]  They could do better intros.  Go fuck.  Is that it?  Like, before we even open our mouths on the fucking...  And you motherfuckers shouldn't be bitching at all, if you know what I mean.  UK Adam, you're fucking...  I swear I'll throw you right the fuck out.  Hi, everybody.  Isn't...  Isn't it lovely?  Oh, it's just lovely.  You're trying to entertain people, and it's just dicks.  It's just dicks. 
[00:02:30]  Fucking...  Ah.  They're just bothered all the time.  They just find something wrong every day.  Every time.  How great was Steve-O yesterday?  I loved him.  That was good.  He's a fun, entertaining guy, man.  That was good.  Amen.  I fucking love Steve-O.  Steve-O rocks.  I meant to ask him.  We talked in the car, but I didn't ask him about the voice.  But it sounds scratchier than it used to.  I just forgot to ask.  His voice is gone.  Like, he has severe fucking problems with his voice box. 
[00:03:00]  But I wonder what it is.  I wonder if it's the drugs.  I think it's scarring on his vocal cords.  From screaming.  It's the puking.  Oh, fuck.  Holy shit.  You know that?  Mm-hmm.  I interviewed him for a New Year's thing we were doing on Raw Dog after for like a couple  minutes, and he said that he's got like a...  Wait, so you asked him about the voice?  Yeah.  And we didn't?  What's wrong with us?  I get to the questions.  I didn't care.  We had other stuff to talk about.  Really?  Yeah.  It was one of those like...  Other stuff?  That was the obvious thing we should have probably asked.  That's right.  We went...  We got some good dirt on fucking him being choked. 
[00:03:30]  We got an ODB naked fucking funeral choking story out of him.  Trust me.  Yours was significantly better.  That a boy, Sam.  All right.  But it's from the puking?  Yeah, yeah.  It's from puking up goldfish and all that.  All right.  Yeah.  He used to puke like a lot.  Yeah.  When you puke, that acid comes up and does all sorts of damage.  Because that's what it is, right?  That's right.  How come models don't sound like that then?  They do a lot of that puking.  And it fucks up their teeth.  Yeah.  But not their voice.  If you puke a lot, it fucks up your teeth as well.  Yeah. 
[00:04:00]  They're just puking up salads.  I mean, Steve-O's puking up light bulbs, goldfish.  Come.  Come.  No.  Come on.  Jesus.  That's what I mean, Captain.  His other story, I asked him about if he was going to permanently change his knuckle tattoos.  Oh, right.  And he said that his family wanted him to, and he went to the tattoo place to get him changed.  But he started having an anxiety attack because he likes it.  He doesn't want to change it.  Oh, right.  But he didn't want to waste the guy's time because he had made an appointment with the tattoo dude.  Oh.  And so instead, he went in, and this is while he was sober, and he got a tattoo on his forearm of a guy behind bars with his big dick hanging out. 
[00:04:30]  And it says on top of it, prison love.  I saw that one, the prison love, on his right forearm.  And then he went home and he showed his family, you see what you made me do?  That's great.  He is the real deal.  Me and Jimmy were talking on the way home yesterday.  We're amazed he's alive.  Yeah, yeah.  Between the incredible partying the guy did and the incredible chances he took with his body, he's lucky to be alive. 
[00:05:00]  But, I mean, he went through circus training and all that, so he always knew how to kind of fall the right way and take some of the fucking hits that he took over the years.  I don't know, though.  That's fucking crazy.  Dude, he let 57 push him three times.  Yeah.  In this story, you get glossed over it.  Three times down the steps in a fucking luggage cart.  Yeah.  Like, you get fucking hit with a luggage cart.  It's going to hurt.  God damn.  And he's doing well sober, man.  I'm pretty fucking happy for the guy. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  So, and then having him and Who Kid in yesterday.  Who Kid is fucking fun, man.  Yeah, I love it.  We got to get him on more.  He cray.  Who Kid is fucking fun.  And they got some stories.  Think he really has a big penis?  Who?  Yeah.  Who Kid?  Who Kid's fun.  Who Kid.  And then you got Ray Liotta yesterday.  That was a good time, too.  That was a pisser.  Fucking guy.  Oh, this is a Steve-O jumping out.  That is a cool little fucking aircraft thing. 
[00:06:00]  Dude, that's crazy.  That's crazy.  That's the seaplane.  He's pedaling in the air.  His fucking legs are moving.  That's the seaplane video.  Yeah.  Where he jumps out of a seaplane about 40, 50 feet in the air.  Oh, my God.  That had to hurt.  Yeah!  His friends are just giggling as he jumps out of a pool.  Of course.  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  Shit.  Put it on your back.  Watch that.  Watch that.  Yeah!  He's hurting.  You all right?  All right?  That was sick.  When you jumped, that was so high.  It was way more than 30 feet.  Oh, yeah, it was.  Holy shit.  I can't pull that.  You got it.  That's insane.  He's a crazy person.  I did that.  No, you didn't.  Put that video up on the Facebook page there, Iraq, please.  Sam's disappointed in Iraq.  Why?  Yeah, I am.  I gotta be honest.  Yeah, we heard a little of this pre-show. 
[00:07:00]  I like Iraq, but I was just, something that he said yesterday, I was like, ah, I wish  he had done a little more.  Iraq, you want to get our mic there?  Sam's disappointed with you.  What else is not?  It's not a big deal.  Oh.  You know, you guys do radio together, you know.  I like Iraq.  Yeah, when Sam's doing his thing, Iraq's there.  Very confident Iraq, a very different Iraq.  Yeah.  Iraq, are you discouraged that Sam is blowing by you, like, as far as on air goes?  No, not really.  Really?  No. 
[00:07:30]  You want to be the behind the scenes guy?  I'm happy where I am.  Yeah.  I've never seen happy where I am look like that.  Yeah, yeah.  But yeah, I was a little disappointed yesterday.  Yeah, yeah.  What happened?  Yeah.  Well, I was listening to the replay and I was reminded, like, you guys asked him a question  yesterday that I really wanted him to answer.  I didn't feel like he answered it as legitimately as he could have. 
[00:08:00]  Open and honestly, which would have been a lot better than the way he did answer.  I felt like he gave an answer that was a little bit politically correct and that wouldn't  hurt feelings on either side.  Okay.  Well, that's Iraq.  But to me...  Iraq's a nice guy.  Yeah, he is a nice guy.  I mean, you can't deny it.  He is a nice guy.  But I really wanted in that moment...  He's shady and all that shit.  Right.  But in the end, he's a pretty shady.  He's a nice guy.  In that moment, I wanted to hear...  He takes some consequences.  Yeah.  Which you can't do if you do this radio show.  Right.  Exactly. 
[00:08:30]  I wanted to hear consequence-free, Iraq, in the moment that I'm talking about.  Exactly.  What was the question that disappointed you?  The question was...  It was in reference.  You said, Iraq, do we have any Ralphie Mae best-of clips?  And Iraq said, no, I'm not really finding a lot of clips.  Right.  And your question to Iraq was, Iraq, why don't you explain to me why you can't find...  Because you said this.  We save pretty much everything. 
[00:09:00]  Pretty much.  Could you maybe explain to me why there aren't a lot of Ralphie Mae best-of clips in the system?  And I felt like Iraq's answer was a little politically correct.  It wasn't quite...  It's kind of like when you ask a politician who their favorite baseball team is.  Yeah.  There's no real, like, commitment to the question.  Yeah, I think Iraq knew that the answer to that question was different than the one that he gave.  Like, the real dirty truth.  Iraq comment?  How did he answer that?  I forget now. 
[00:09:30]  It was so vague, I don't even remember.  He said, well, because he was only on once or twice, and a couple of them were phoners, and it was like, there's a really more direct answer than that.  There's a really good answer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What did Iraq say?  That's what he said.  Very vague.  Yeah, like, well...  A couple phoners, a couple, you know...  Hard to find, because we...  Yeah, yeah, there was...  Iraq. 
[00:10:00]  Comment?  It's not my beef with him.  Well, wait, wait, it's not a matter of taking shots, it's just a matter of answering the question.  That, and there you go, everyone.  That's exactly what you were just saying.  That's what Opie was saying.  That's the frustration of Iraq.  No, you want me to shit on the guy, and I...  No.  No, we want...  I gave you the answer as to why we don't have it.  No, we want...  Why don't you feel like you could be one of the guys here on the show, and be part of the show?  But it goes deeper than that.  We're not...  We're not...  If you don't want to shit on somebody, that is fine, but you don't answer anything honestly. 
[00:10:30]  You know the answer.  And that's all we were asking for.  Right.  We don't have, really, anything best of a Ralphie May.  Iraq likes keeping all his options open.  And why is that?  Won't burn one bridge.  Because there was nothing really worth saving.  There you go.  Which implies...  Was he a bit lackluster on the show?  Some guys, you know, they could be a little lackluster.  Iraq's a queer. 
[00:11:00]  For many reasons.  Who comes to that conclusion?  The guy's talking over Iraq.  You're a Peter Pumper.  You just like saying that.  I certainly do.  It really is.  Fun to say.  That's why...  That's why...  I don't know.  That's why...  And now he's going to get mad, but that's what frustrates me with him.  Like, we're not...  I mean, we just want you to be honest if we ask you a question.  That's all.  That's it.  Because when he's all balls, everybody loves him.  Oh, God. 
[00:11:30]  I love Iraq when he shows his balls.  Right.  Absolutely.  Big fan of that.  Me too.  Big fan of Iraq balls.  Yes.  Big fan of the Iraq balls.  Iraq balls.  Who doesn't love Brass Balls Nagel?  Oh, yeah.  You know?  Brass Balls Nagel.  That's a good one.  I like that.  He only pops up...  And I love how...  I love how we get mad at people for being nice guys.  It can't exist here.  What's wrong with us?  It really doesn't work here.  Like, in the real world, people would be like, God, that Iraq's a nice guy. 
[00:12:00]  We're like...  And here we're like, yeah, I know.  It stinks.  Yeah.  Makes it difficult for the rest of us.  Right.  Takes away our fun sometimes.  I'm a nice guy, but I'm not around here.  I'm not.  Who gives a fuck here?  Nagel spouted off about some guy on Twitter for fucking ragging on Jim Jeffries' baby.  He did?  And Iraq was like, hey.  Iraq stepped right up for that.  Hey, the fuck is wrong with you?  What was wrong with Jim Jeffries' baby?  Nothing.  Adorable.  But some guy said, like, oh, nice fetal alcohol syndrome eyes. 
[00:12:30]  And he got the term wrong, too.  Did he?  Yeah.  He said the whole thing wrong.  But it's just like, the guy just posted a kid, posted a photo of his brand new baby.  Yeah.  And you're saying, because if you're drinking, your kid looks retarded.  Right.  Well, Jesus, what's wrong with some of these people that listen to our show?  Iraq slammed him back, though.  He called that guy.  Oh, Nagel fucking jumped on him.  He said, wow, you're an unfunny, four-eyed shithead.  Yes, that's it.  That's what Iraq wrote.  See?  And that's what I love right there. 
[00:13:00]  See?  That's Brass Balls Nagel right there.  Some of those Brass Balls.  Who's got the account, man?  Iraq's Balls.  Who's going to get it on Twitter?  Brass Balls Nagel.  Or Brass Balls Nagel.  That works.  Right, right.  Iraq's Balls or Brass Balls Nagel.  You know what we just did?  That's a fucking name.  There's going to be about 20 Iraq Ball Twitter accounts.  Or Balls, whatever.  So Ralphie May calling in today?  Oh, shit.  Nice.  That's confirmed.  Is he still hurting?  Is he hurting?  There were tweets yesterday.  Are his feelings hurt? 
[00:13:30]  There were some Ralphie May tweets yesterday?  Yeah, yeah.  He was talking to...  I missed him.  He's a little frustrated that you didn't really comment to his tweet.  I fucking didn't...  I wasn't even...  I was really on Twitter last night.  I don't spend my whole fucking life on Twitter.  Sometimes I have little fucking, you know, discussions, arguments, fucking outbursts,  whatever you want to call them.  But last night, you know what?  I was doing shit.  Wow.  How is that?  It's pretty fun.  Damn it.  I like doing shit.  Went out to dinner last night. 
[00:14:00]  It was fucking great.  Had a little wine.  A nice fucking Italian restaurant.  A little wine.  A little wine.  Nah, I split a bottle, so it was cool.  You go to, you know, downtown.  No, I actually kept it over there in Restaurant Row.  I know.  My normal place.  The usual place.  They treat me very nice over there.  Which one do you go to over there?  I'm not going to say.  I'm not going to say, because it is one of those places I go to a lot, and the fucking  owner knows me now.  I walk in, he's like, ah, Anthony, hello. 
[00:14:30]  He gives me a little shake of the hand.  That's good.  That's nice.  Oh, it's fucking great.  He knows exactly what I want.  Brings fucking a bottle of wine over immediately.  Fucking the cheese with the balsamic reduction on a plate, and bread, and you're just fucking  shoving shit in your face.  Oh, it's fantastic.  I really want to eat that now.  It's so good.  Wait, does he go to...  Do you go to a...  None of it's on Restaurant Row.  It's a place I don't know.  I normally don't eat there.  That's just for tourists.  Yeah, you know what? 
[00:15:00]  It's kind of a...  Wait, you know where he goes?  I know where Restaurant Row is.  It's 40...  Oh, no, I know that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's, um...  Yeah, I'm not...  No secret where Restaurant Row is.  Is it called something like that?  No.  No.  Is it on the corner?  No.  That's...  You spell McDonald's wrong.  Is it on the corner?  Uh, no.  No, it's kind of mid-block, a little further away from, um, like, Times Square and shit.  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough.  It's...  But it's fucking...  I like it because the guy, like, fucking really hooks me up.  Why is Ralphie May... 
[00:15:30]  Stuffed artichokes.  Why is Ralphie May, like, doing this?  So what did he write last night?  But hold on, but where did this even begin?  This began when, fucking a year ago, a year ago about, when I fucking...  Went on, live from the Compound show, and, um, somebody asked me about Ralphie May, and  I just started talking about how it's very difficult to do our show when he's on the show.  I was talking about how, uh, uh, it's very difficult. 
[00:16:00]  Like, I like when I tell a story and stuff to have a little dynamic to the delivery.  You got your highs and lows.  You got your little pauses, dramatic pause, whatever you want to say.  There might be some searching within the story itself.  You're trying to find the right words.  Trying to find the rhythm of it.  And in the middle of a story, when you know you can't even stop for a second because you're  going to get,  Oh, shit!  Oh!  Oh!  You don't have it without a day!  It's like, I just...  And then I just fucking, I push the mic away, lean back on my chair and go, 
[00:16:30]  All right.  My hands go out and I'm like,  Well, all right.  It doesn't make me want to say...  That was a year ago?  Yes, let's have Ralphie May on the show when shit like that, when I just know that that's  what the show is going to be.  And that was a year ago.  That was a year ago.  I think recently we did take a shot at his laugh.  But we're going to do a whole production piece with guys that laugh way too hard and loud 
[00:17:00]  into the microphone.  We're going to do that very soon.  You got the Who Kid, you got Ricky Gervais, you got Ralphie May.  Yeah.  Bert Kreischer laughs really hard.  Bert Kreischer laughs really hard into the mic.  Godfrey laughs really hard into the mic.  Seth Rogen, someone's saying?  Seth, we're going to do a whole fucking production piece.  So Ralphie May should be flattered.  He's going to be part of that.  He might be the star of that piece.  Could be.  The star of the piece.  And Ant said he...  Maybe we can make it into some kind of rock festival production piece where he's the headliner.  Oh, brother. 
[00:17:30]  Ant said he started that a year ago.  But that's not to say that's the only time it's been mentioned.  I said recently, I think we're going to find his life.  It's been mentioned.  Well, it's become the thing.  It's become the thing.  But then it came up two days ago.  All right, so what did he tweet yesterday?  Well, two days ago was the original tweet because Ant was in his Patton Oswalt battle.  Right.  And for whatever reason, Ralphie May just chimed in in the middle of my Patton Oswalt discussion.  Oh, so he's sort of doing the same thing on Twitter. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can't believe he did the same thing on Twitter.  Are you saying he has bad timing when he pipes in?  Horrid timing.  Oh, he pipes in.  Oh, he's doing great.  I would have...  Ow.  You've played that a couple times now.  I would swear that's Patrice O'Neal, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  Patrice would do that.  Oh, Patrice has to be on that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:18:30]  Patrice, at times, laughed really hard into the mic.  Yes, yes.  But you knew it was completely genuine.  Yes.  Patrice wouldn't laugh unless he found something fucking funny.  And he wouldn't trample stories when he laughed.  Mm-mm.  Yeah, for the most part.  Like he would add to the experience.  We're all guilty of that shit, but yeah, in general.  Ah.  Yeah, but just like when he's in here, I mean, there was no reason for him to...  That was like the worst timing to like...  I read that.  ...start, as they like to say, a beef with you. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  And it was done on fucking Tweet Longer.  So it was a fucking big long thing I was reading.  Twit Longer, whatever.  Twit Longer, whatever the fuck it's called.  What a waste of time that is.  Oh, no one fucking...  Just look at your words and cut a few of them out.  The whole thing is 140 characters.  That's the whole gist of it.  Yeah.  It's just such a funny response, though, because I was reading all this Anthony Patton Oswalt stuff,  and then all of a sudden, Ralphie May tweets him and says,  Anthony, why did you say all that cunty shit about me? 
[00:19:30]  What the fuck did I ever do to you?  Hey, you guys don't want me on the show?  That's cool.  Whatever.  But that shit was uncalled for.  You got a problem with me?  By all means, it would take your producers two phone calls or less to get my number.  You can talk to me like a fucking man.  Like a fucking man?  Don't call my manhood into question, fucker.  Jesus.  Anthony just responded by saying, oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, period.  Because I'm in the middle of something.  Well.  I'm in the middle of something. 
[00:20:00]  He sounded a little like John Candy.  I said that yesterday.  But when you read that, I just see John Candy all upset and bothered.  When someone asks me a simple question and I answer it, I'm not like, well, you know what?  Before I answer this, let me get Ralphie on the phone and, you know, like a man, I'll discuss it.  Like a man?  Just stop with the like a man.  And look, I've seen Ralphie May do stand-up.  He's funny.  Yeah.  Ralphie May is funny. 
[00:20:30]  You know, maybe he's had a few lackluster appearances on the show, but he's a funny stand-up.  I would never take that away from him.  Lackluster is a funny term.  I'm being E-Rock.  Oh, just trying to make sure.  Yeah, you know, lackluster.  Lackluster means, you know, you're having a bad day.  Right.  It's a little worse than having a bad day.  It might be, nah, I'm not sure if it's a bad day or if this is your, this is how it's going to be.  I love the word lackluster. 
[00:21:00]  So yesterday, some fan tweeted him and said, you tweeted last night and started it.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure that's how it went down.  Called their show tomorrow.  And Ralphie wrote, I talked directly to Ant, asked for an explanation.  I got none.  That's how it went down.  Well, because, I mean, but he could have easily got Anthony's number if he had a problem.  And what am I supposed to just drop what I'm doing and give him an explanation to his twit-longer 
[00:21:30]  and fucking sit there while I'm in the middle of having a discussion?  That twit-longer bothers you, huh?  I fucking hate the twit-longer.  Just so he could, you know, call my manhood into question because I didn't fucking get on the phone with fucking Roland  and get him booked and fucking, you know, it's not that important to me.  Can you imagine if you called Ralphie May and said, listen, Ralphie, I wanted to talk to you person to person  and let you know that you laughed too loudly. 
[00:22:00]  Yes.  He'd be like, why are you calling me?  Because I'm a man.  And I feel I should, I should be a man.  And it's what it is.  Maybe he'll call today, whatever.  That's what it is.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, gosh.  Big news, we lost the free agent guy.  Marvin Miller.  Yellow.  Marvin Miller was largely responsible for free agency in baseball.  He has passed at the age of 95.  Marvin Miller.  Oh, I'm thinking there's another guy that... 
[00:22:30]  Marvin Miller is pretty much responsible.  Before that, man, it was tough to be traded and all that.  Who's the guy they did a documentary on?  He's a black player.  He died of cancer.  He's been dead for a little while.  Who was what?  He was a drinker.  He was...  He sued them because he couldn't...  I forget.  That's not his name, though.  I can't remember.  There's a documentary on him.  Can you look it up?  Free agency documentary.  What the fuck guy am I thinking of?  I'm confused.  Travis would probably help us out on this one.  As soon as I hear him, I'll know his name. 
[00:23:00]  Travis knows his name.  Was he one of the first free agency guys?  Yeah, they...  Who was one of the first free agency guys?  They...  There used to be an answer to that.  I have no idea about this.  What?  Cub...  Who this is?  Kurt Flood.  Kurt Flood.  That's who.  The fascinating and tragic life of free agency pioneer Kurt Flood.  What happened to Kurt Flood?  He sued and his career was ruined.  I think his drinking ruined it, too.  But why was his career ruined with free agency? 
[00:23:30]  Well, because he was fighting for it.  He...  I forget the...  I saw the documentary.  I don't remember.  He wanted to be traded.  He played in the 60s.  I want to say, like, for St. Louis in the 60s, right?  Yeah, that's about right.  Late 60s, early 70s.  And he wanted to have control over where he went.  And I think he sued baseball.  And I think he sued...  I don't know who else.  Maybe the owners.  Right.  I don't know who else he sued.  Huh.  I'm giving really nothing to the discussion.  I just remember it was Kurt Flood.  Well, now I've got to see this documentary. 
[00:24:00]  It's very good.  I'm a sucker for a good documentary.  Yeah, it's really good.  Documentaries rule.  Even bad ones are good for whatever reason.  They could be about the most inane subject matter.  That's what I mean.  Just dumb shit.  It's like, wow, that's pretty fucking cool.  Right.  I didn't know that.  Do you see the one about...  HBO is the best documentary.  Yeah.  The one about the fucking women that have acid thrown in their faces.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah, that's like a niche kind of a doc, isn't it?  But it happens a lot in the Middle East if you refuse marriage or whatever. 
[00:24:30]  You know, these fucking jerk-offs.  They're fucking masculinity.  They can't handle being rejected.  So they throw acid.  No, not some of Ralphie.  They wind up throwing acid in the girl's face.  Saving face it might have been called.  I want to know more about Kurt Flood now.  Is that like a little preview for the documentary, maybe?  Yeah.  Oh, not available anymore.  Oh, of course not.  Look out.  But Marvin Miller is one of the guys that is absolutely responsible for the free agency. 
[00:25:00]  No.  He was in charge of the players and all that shit.  Died at the age of 95.  There's a picture with him and a very young Joe Torre in the paper today.  Right at the age of 103.  Announcing that the baseball strike of 1972 is over.  Do they always fucking strike?  I think so.  Oh, yeah.  Always?  I don't know.  When we were growing up, I don't remember a lot of baseball strikes.  No, I don't remember a lot of them.  Yeah, you're right.  But now it seems like easily every five years you're going to get one. 
[00:25:30]  They'll strike at the drop of a hat.  Yeah.  Speaking of which, I don't think there's going to be hockey this year.  And no one gives a fuck.  No, no one cares.  There's no clamor about it.  My hockey pals, they don't care.  No one cares.  Have a coach sell.  Poor Kurt Flood.  A well-paid slave is number one.  All right, go back.  Oh, man.  That shit.  If there's anything that I can ever do as far as this fight for freedom is concerned,  certainly count on me.  Jackie Robinson was his Superman.  He was his hero, his absolute hero. 
[00:26:00]  Kurt Flood was a hell of a ball player.  If you ask me, would Kurt Flood be the kind of guy to sue baseball, I'd say no.  You will never have another job in baseball again.  Ever.  I realized that this is really a man of principle.  Curtis had a really hard life.  He was a tormented soul.  He had tremors in his hand.  I didn't know where my father was.  He was not available.  You're dealing with the nature of terrorism.  I don't want anybody to own me. 
[00:26:30]  That belongs to me.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Yeah, it's very good.  I got to see that.  There you go.  Kurt Flood.  For what behind the ears?  Ah, Chipper.  Fucking hilarious, Chipper.  Telling me.  You're doing it.  We obviously don't have anything on Marvin Miller.  I'm just saying.  Yeah, I never heard of him.  He was a huge sports figure.  Marvin Miller? 
[00:27:00]  They showed him in that documentary.  That was Marvin Miller.  Oh, okay.  He was one of the guys there.  Absolutely.  Patrice O'Neill died a year ago today, you know.  Oh, yeah.  I think we all know that.  It's kind of a little strange.  Bon voyage.  Big fella.  We're going to do the Patrice O'Neill special, E-Rock.  Yes, this weekend.  Saturday starting at 8 a.m.  Nice.  Running throughout the weekend.  Very cool.  And we're going to play some shit in and out of breaks today.  Yeah, we can do that. 
[00:27:30]  Maybe some of his stand-up.  From his, you know, the newer CDs.  From Mr. P and if you want Elephant in a Room.  And there's also that 20-minute thing that's released on iTunes.  What's it called?  Do we know?  Better Than You.  Better Than You.  That's on iTunes now?  Yes.  And that was not on Mr. P, I think.  Was that...  It was supposed to, but the bit was too long, and he didn't, from the story I got, he didn't  want to cut anything.  Out of that...  So he decided to leave that whole thing off and then was going to release it as a part 
[00:28:00]  of something else, but since he died, they decided to release it as a digital single.  Okay.  It's a 20-minute piece of material that is not on Mr. P that was, you know, obviously  intended to be on Mr. P, but why am I explaining what E-Rock just explained?  But I'm doing it like I knew it.  I literally just asked you on the radio for an explanation, and then when you said it,  I gave a more quote-unquote in-depth explanation.  What a phony I am.  Did you forget that maybe he was on the air with you?  I forgot that it happened three seconds before.  Yes, I did. 
[00:28:30]  So what E-Rock said?  All right.  So that kid from Two and a Half Men kind of apologized to the cast and crew.  Remember yesterday, we were like, what the fuck?  Why would you do that to the gang you're working with?  He's a douche.  I think someone got a hold of him and said, do you realize how much fucking money you make?  He's like, look, you idiot.  What the fuck are you thinking?  Ride this shit out and then find Jesus.  Yeah. 
[00:29:00]  But don't find Jesus until those paychecks run out.  What a spoiled brat.  Oh, he has no concept of reality.  What a spoiled little brat.  A lot of these fucking Hollywood people are really fucking like so insulated from the real world.  Especially when you're that young when you came up doing a sitcom like that and that's all you know from life.  Jesus Christ.  Take a look around and see what's really happening.  Yeah, you've got an amazing life.  And he's like, and I guess he's not willing to completely commit. 
[00:29:30]  No, but his whole thing that he was talking about on the tape was committing 100%.  Yeah, and now he's not committing.  So what is it with this kid?  He's an idiot.  He's confused.  Is he scared that he's going to get sued or something?  The fucked up thing is we're talking about a 19-year-old guy here, which, you know, fucking idiots in general.  Yeah, we were all idiots at 19.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, I didn't really have a grasp on shit at 19, that's for sure.  No. 
[00:30:00]  You still don't?  Take his hat on that one.  We just started pretty much.  What are you afraid?  Well, it was a home run, but, you know, we're going to hang out a little longer.  If you don't mind.  If you don't mind, Chippa.  I don't mind.  Is that okay with you?  You think Chippa's trying to cut it short?  Yeah, Chippa.  And, of course, the apology, as we all know, is all bullshit.  Waddle.  He still believes exactly in everything he said on that prior tape. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  But now the apology, because somebody got to him, either a lawsuit, you know, possibility, or something.  Fucking Chuck Lorre's had to deal with some shit with this show, man.  No kidding.  I think John Cryer's like, Jesus Christ, will you guys just fucking behave?  John Cryer's just shaking, like, stop it, I have a job.  Do you understand this is the first fucking job I've had since Pretty in Pink?  Leave me alone.  What are you doing to me?  And I gotta bring up John Cryer again, man.  When me and Ed first started doing radio, that guy wandered around that museum out there in L.A., 
[00:31:00]  and no one gave his shit, no one talked to him.  He actually went there.  He wasn't scheduled to appear.  It was one of those radio junkets where they bring the celebrities through.  And he was there.  And he was just wandering around, like, making believe he just happened to be at this place.  Like, hey, who wants to talk to me?  And no one talked to him.  There was no one who wants to talk to him, man.  And now he's one of the biggest sitcom stars in the world.  In America, whatever.  Yeah.  Remember that?  Yes.  That was fucked up.  Awkwardly walking by radio guys, like, hoping. 
[00:31:30]  Like, trying to lock eye contact without making eye contact.  Yeah, yeah, all that shit.  Very awkward.  That's so uncomfortable.  You want to kind of ask, like, you know how we do with people walking by this?  Hey, look who's out there.  Come on in.  No, you walk out there and go, yo, you the rat cats?  I don't think that's what he was doing.  Those no-kicking bitches.  Yeah, they really refuse to do a kick.  Yeah, I got them in here, though.  For us.  Or when Stanley Tucci's walking around and he has to hear, yo, Tucci!  Yo, Tucci!  I told him, uh, subtlety is not there. 
[00:32:00]  I told him yesterday, thank God you're back, because that show's been hurting without you.  Who?  And I did it right in front of the rest of the morning mashup.  Oh, to Tucci!  Yo, Tucci!  Thank God you're back!  The mashup.  I gotta be nice in the mashup.  Why?  I need some One Direction help.  I'll hook you up.  Oh, boy.  Can you help?  The mashup loves me.  I'm on the channel.  Is One Direction coming in here?  I think they're doing it at a secret location.  I don't know if they're coming in here.  And what, is Morning Mashup fucking interviewing them?  Yeah, Morning Mashup's doing like that.  When is this going down? 
[00:32:30]  Who are they interviewing?  One Direction.  One Direction.  Damn.  Biggest boy band in the world.  I think, uh, like, within weeks, it's happening.  I got two nieces.  You want me to see what I can do?  Yes.  Okay.  Even if I have to...  I would even suck it up and go talk to that idiot down the wall.  Oh, wow, that was scary.  Suck it up?  I thought, well, when you said suck, I was like, I would even suck.  I would even...  Where's this going?  Will you blow Stanley T?  Oh.  No.  If he wants it.  No, I would march down the hall and talk to Greenstein.  Would you play with Stanley T's balls for it? 
[00:33:00]  You don't have to suck it.  You just have to cuddle him a little bit.  I don't think it's gay if you're doing it for your nieces, right?  No, it's not.  That's very nice of you.  It's a task.  A task.  It's not gay if it's a task.  What is Eminem in the building, too?  I want to interview him.  It's time for his five-year visit.  You'd like to interview Eminem, would you?  I'd love to, yeah.  He's not set for his yearly visit, right?  I heard he is doing SNL.  Who could tell me...  That's what I'm saying.  So, within a month or two...  You know SNL's a block away, so that means he will hang out on his channel, right?  Well, I asked Who Kid.  So, is he going to come up and do the channel?  And he went... 
[00:33:30]  He don't do shit.  Holy fuck.  Like, there's the song on The Voice.  Yeah.  Who Kid was performing the song with Adam Levine and 50 Cent.  The song is Eminem, 50 Cent, and Adam Levine.  Eminem didn't go do The Voice.  Why?  He didn't want to.  Why would he?  But he has a channel here.  Yeah, he doesn't want to stop by.  So, how about they stop paying the guy and they turn that thing into something else?  They don't need his stamp on that?  I see a backwards E over there.  He's lending his brand. 
[00:34:00]  What is the brand at this point?  Eminem Slim Shady.  Well, Sway does a good job with the morning show and they got some shit going on.  You got the Who Kid.  You don't need to tell everyone it's the Eminem channel if the guy doesn't show up.  Is something going on over there today that they got the little sign out with their fucking logo over there?  Where?  I know.  I would bet that that was just in there yesterday and they put it out in the hallway.  All right.  It's kind of...  Seeing it out the window kind of reminds me, you know, what neighborhood I'm in here and it's part of the building.  I got you.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:34:30]  Hide your kids, hide your wife.  Isn't that ironic?  We're right across the street.  Well, I want to paint railroad tracks on that rug.  They're across the tracks.  They'll get pissed off.  The other side of the tracks.  Can we do that one day?  That would be great.  I want to see if Sway and the gang has a sense of humor.  I just want railroad tracks on that rug.  Did you hear Who Kid's story on the after show yesterday?  No, I don't listen to the after show.  Boy, I wasn't driving home.  We were trying to be entertained on the way home.  I didn't go home.  I stayed in the city.  We listened to Kenny.  Well...  Kenny...  Oh, now we have to listen to you? 
[00:35:00]  You don't have to.  What happened?  Because you just reminded me of Kenny.  I was just going to say, Big Pun, the rapper who's dead now.  Yeah.  When Who Kid was first making mixtapes and stealing people's CDs out of studios to make  them, that's what he did.  Oh, nice.  He put out a Big Pun diss song that nobody had put out yet.  Yeah.  Big Pun tricked him into thinking that he was getting booked for a gig, and he pulled him  into a van and put an Uzi to his head.  Holy fuck.  It's a true story.  Those motherfuckers are ruthless.  They don't play.  He had an Uzi to Who Kid's head. 
[00:35:30]  But what did Big Pun want?  He wanted respect.  He said, don't fuck him.  No, but what did he want?  Did he tell him not to release it?  No, I mean, it was released.  You can't just put an Uzi to someone's head without getting something done.  It was a warning.  It was simply just like, so what did Who Kid do after he had the Uzi to his head?  He stopped stealing people's tapes.  Oh, okay.  That was it.  Don't fuck with my shit.  So it was too late for the Big Pun thing that he released.  Right, but Big Pun let him know, do not ever do that again.  I'm not the one to fuck with at all.  What did Big Pun die of?  I don't know.  I don't think he was murdered. 
[00:36:00]  He was a giant man.  It was probably heart problems or something.  Maybe.  Was Who Kid scared?  Yeah.  Yeah, he was terrified.  He said it was Big Pun and like two other guys, and they pulled him into a van, and the  three of them had Uzis around him.  So why wouldn't they have just killed him?  I can't just, I don't know.  He said, what he told me was, they realized.  I'm serious, because the rapper guys, they, you know.  They realized he was pussy, and so they didn't kill him, because he's a pussy.  Like, they're like, oh, this kid's a pussy, because nobody knew who he was at that time. 
[00:36:30]  He wasn't being all hard with them, like, yeah, motherfucker.  Yeah, come on, bring that, give me that.  They wouldn't get enough cred if they killed him.  Right, because you can't kill a pussy.  Put a trigger, nigga.  Come on, motherfucker.  It's like killing women and children.  Yeah.  You don't do it.  Yeah.  Wow.  Kill Who Kid.  That's crazy.  Who Kid's like, fucking, yeah.  He's a pussy.  He's a pussy.  He's a pussy.  Kenny was telling me and Jimmy that his, is it officially his dojo or whatever?  The guy that runs his, uh.  Look, my dojo!  Yeah.  The guy that runs the karate school that he goes to? 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Is in his low 70s, and basically kicks Kenny's ass.  Really?  Kenny said he almost tripped him once.  That's the closest he's come.  We all know Kenny's a monster.  Kenny knows his shit.  Wow.  He's very good at the karate.  What is he like?  The fucking Kill Bill guy?  With the gray fucking...  Is that what he's like?  I don't know.  Kenny says he's not an ounce of fat on this guy.  He's in his early 70s and throws him around like he's nothing. 
[00:37:30]  Wow.  And Kenny almost tripped him once.  Almost once?  Almost once.  Supposedly he was like a judo champion or something, this guy, back in the day.  But in his early 70s, he's still an animal, this guy.  He is a master.  But I thought that was kind of interesting, you know?  Kenny, Kenny, he just can't knock the guy down.  Amazing.  I would love to see that guy throwing Kenny around.  Absolutely.  That's what I'm looking at.  Ow.  Ow.  Stop it.  He said he goes full force on Kenny because Kenny's so big. 
[00:38:00]  Right.  Yeah.  That he doesn't take it easy on him.  Right.  Yeah, that's got to be rough for Kenny because he is big.  Like, people figure they could just toss him around.  He's just not big in the heart or the brain.  No.  They figure he could handle a lot more than the average person, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Toss that motherfucker around.  All right.  That was it on the Two and a Half Men guy.  He just released a statement sort of apologizing to the casting crew.  We didn't get his statement, really.  It's, well, it's basically he's grateful to have the highest, I'm grateful to and have 
[00:38:30]  the highest regard and respect for all of the wonderful people on Two and a Half Men  with whom I have worked and over the past ten years who have become an extension of my  family.  Oh, really?  He showed that respect by saying, don't watch it to people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What did he change his mind in 24 hours?  Is that what happened?  I doubt it.  They probably said, because CBS, you know, makes a lot of money off Two and a Half Men, 
[00:39:00]  obviously.  So they probably got to him and basically said, look, you're in breach of contract and  we could sue you for everything you have.  They probably scared the shit out of him.  So he went to his people and his people fucking put that out.  Yeah.  He has nothing to do with that statement.  I have been the subject of much discussion, speculation and commentary.  There's no speculation.  You heard what he said.  It was obvious.  Yeah.  And that's the next part.  While I cannot address everything that has been said or write every misstatement or misunderstanding. 
[00:39:30]  See, it's not a misstatement or misunderstanding.  You told people not to watch the show you're on.  Right.  It was pretty obvious.  You told people it's an evil show.  It's it's filth.  It's filth.  And you don't want to be on it and not to watch it.  There's not much you have to speculate there.  You know?  Yeah.  Good for you.  Fucking how much per episode?  $350,000.  Holy shit.  $8 million a season.  This fucking little baby boy is crying about.  That's what Sam gets per show here. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, but he makes it worth it.  Yeah, yeah.  Sam brings in that kind of revenue simply by the people signing up.  Look at this little lummox bringing our food.  Lummox.  How many years would you have to work to make one week's salary?  To make $350,000?  $350,000.  $350,000.  $350,000.  That would be years, obviously.  Yeah.  It would be a long, long, long.  Years.  And this kid makes it in one week and he's not happy about it.  It's not a realistic number to me.  Unbelievable.  Kenny, we were talking about what you told us in the car yesterday. 
[00:40:30]  Okay.  Mr. Personality right there.  Your Nambla membership.  We were just saying how this guy in his 70s throws you around.  It could slick their hair back.  And we gave you nothing but respect.  We said you know you're shit and you know how to handle yourself, but the guy that runs  your gym there is just an animal in his 70s still.  That's why he's the sensei.  The sensei.  All right.  Sensei.  Gojo is the place. 
[00:41:00]  Duh.  Bow to your sensei.  Go to your sensei.  Is he frustrating?  I mean, it's a way of life for those people.  You know, they do it since they're kids.  Like, you know, it's like their gym class in school.  They do martial arts.  Sweep the leg, dummy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can give you his book to read.  I have it here.  On the air?  A book?  Well, we could do that for book radio, but.  Oh, boy.  But I told everyone that you almost tripped him once after all these years. 
[00:41:30]  That's the closest you got to doing anything to him.  Yes, that's correct.  And did he make it hurt after you didn't trip him?  You know, when you get slammed to the ground about 20 times.  What do you mean?  He could pick you up?  I can know how all those black people felt when you were on the job.  Exactly.  Can he pick you up?  Yeah, it's judo.  You friggin.  Judo.  Chop, chop.  Throw people around.  Yeah?  But he's in his 70s.  Yeah, I know, but he's all. 
[00:42:00]  That's no way to talk about how bagels are made.  That's just inappropriate.  Oh, Chip.  That sounded a lot like Jim Norton.  Yeah, but it was Chip.  Did you get it?  I don't think you were getting anywhere with this.  No, actually, I didn't.  I didn't hear the line right before it.  I was concentrating too much on what hilarity was going to come out of my own mouth.  Oh, Jesus.  Because he said judo.  Oh, judo.  Oh. 
[00:42:30]  All right, now that's fucking funny.  Judo.  No, it's a great workout.  You should try it.  Yeah?  No, we were just fascinated that a guy in his early 70s could stay in that type of shape  and still, you know, beat the shit out of everybody.  Well, he works out a couple hours a day every day.  Yeah, but I know.  Most 70-year-old guys, you know, don't have that strength.  No.  They get a little fucking brittle, and they lose what they call muscle mace. 
[00:43:00]  Not him.  He grabs you.  You know you're grabbed.  Really?  Yeah.  Tosses you around?  Like a rag doll.  What does he go, come at me?  Does he say that?  Like, come at me.  And then he just fucking uses your own inertia against you?  He doesn't talk.  He might grunt once in a while.  Really?  Yeah.  How tall is he?  He's six foot.  Oh.  That's a tall sensei.  Like 180.  Yeah? 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  Is he Asian?  Japanese.  He's Japanese.  Yeah.  Oh, so he's the real fucking deal, that guy.  So he's about my size.  I can't even imagine doing anything to him.  That's Mr. Miyagi.  Right.  Well, back in his day, he was the middleweight world champion judo player and Olympic judo  coach.  He's 70?  Was he in an internment camp back in the old days?  No.  Was he interned?  More Olympians came out of his school than any other school. 
[00:44:00]  He teaches sumo wrestling there.  Sumo?  Is he fat?  No, he's not fat, but there's a guy, Manny Yarbrough, if you want to look him up real  quick.  I used to smoke those.  It's no judo.  He's almost 700 pounds.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Is he a board op?  But why would you do sumo in America?  Aren't you...  Exactly.  Just talk it over with him, though.  There's no reason to bring the legal system into it.  Kenny, why isn't he in Japan? 
[00:44:30]  No one gives a fuck about sumo wrestling in America.  If he's 700 pounds and wants to do this, talk to my lawyer.  Isn't he supposed to be in some small town in Japan somewhere?  Yeah.  I don't know.  No, but sumo has made a resurgence.  I am the man who will fight for your honor.  It can't make a resurgence if it was never really a thing in America. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  How is it making a resurgence?  True.  I don't know.  Are we going to start collecting the sumo cards again?  I never flipped for sumo cards.  The only time we knew about sumo was like, what, Wide World of Sports or something?  Yes.  And once in a while, they would fucking throw that on the TV.  Yeah.  That's him.  No, no, no.  He's a black guy, man.  Oh, is he?  A black sumo wrestler.  We can't find him online. 
[00:45:30]  Well, I just don't know how to spell his name.  Oh, my God.  That's a fat fuck right there.  Gio Kozuna.  Where's Sam?  Sam.  Isn't he missing a leg or something?  Is he that guy?  No, that's Kamala.  He's dead.  Yoko's dead.  Yoko's dead.  Kamala got his leg cut off?  Both of them.  Both of them?  Yeah.  Diabetes.  Of course.  The damn diabetes got him?  And he used to wrestle barefoot, so that ain't happening anymore.  Oh, man.  Does he still wrestle?  Oh, God.  He hasn't yet.  Well, what the fuck? 
[00:46:00]  Is that a dumb question?  Vince McMahon would love to have him in the ring again.  Get your legless ass in.  We're going to have a wheelchair match.  Fucking shit.  Nothing stops that guy.  No.  All right, Kenny.  I guess that's it on the sensei thing.  It's fucking crazy sensei.  That's 70.  Yeah.  He teaches karate also.  Kirate, Jerry. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Kirate.  It would be funny if his first name was Common.  It's just common sensei.  I think Kenny left on that.  Of course he did.  We're not taking him seriously.  It's his thing.  No, that is his thing, huh?  That's how he stays in shape.  I was just amazed by the whole thing.  That's all. 
[00:47:00]  We all got our things we do to try to, you know, stay fit.  Yeah.  As it were.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to go to break with some Patrice O'Neill.  Ooh.  And we're going to eat.  And I think we got to start looking at the jingle contest again.  Yeah.  We got the finalists in front of us.  Yeah.  So we can play a few today, a few tomorrow, and then Friday we'll announce the winner.  It's exciting.  It's very exciting.  I have a very special announcement today.  Oh. 
[00:47:30]  Very special.  Going to play Powerball?  I actually might.  I am.  I'm going to play.  What number are you playing?  I'm going to play 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Powerball 6.  Why would you give your numbers out like that?  That's some good numbers right there.  Those are some good numbers.  With my luck, I'd win, but share it with 450 million other people.  Get a fuck.  You should have to taxes 30 cents.  What's this thing up to?  Better invest it.  500 million dollars. 
[00:48:00]  That's pretty good.  Do you know how fucking what a dick I'd be if I won this?  Oh.  Would you share?  I'd give some to charity.  No, I'm in with me.  No.  Why?  I'd probably pay you to do stupid things.  Oh, wouldn't that be great?  Like start wearing a mini skirt with panties.  I'll give you 10 grand.  And just offer him too much money not to do it?  Yeah, humiliate himself.  Oh, you'd be a bitch.  Just go say Rachel Leppett that's all over the building.  Yeah.  I'd do that for 10 grand a week.  I'd do it for free.  You think they hold back the numbers to get this Powerball up? 
[00:48:30]  How would they do that?  No, because the scandal would wreck it.  And it's way suspicious that this happens from time to time.  Sometimes it just doesn't fucking go over.  Really?  Yeah.  With all the people playing.  Yeah, isn't it amazing?  It's a little strange to me is all I'm saying.  I think they'll get it this time, though.  It's my conspiracy thing.  Because now everyone's going to look.  Of course, now.  It's on the news.  It's one of the times where it's the big news story.  Oh, wait.  Here it is.  They're going to do it.  Swear for us this morning.  Good morning.  Here's the typical story on the Milano.  Good morning.  You know, the odds are pretty slim, but it's not keeping people away from buying those Powerball 
[00:49:00]  tickets.  Soledad.  I'm one of them.  I bought one ticket.  And you know what?  One's all you need.  You've got to be in it to win it.  And I'm in it at least with one ticket.  A lot of people coming in today with dreams, at least dreaming of what they would do with  the money, as they get their morning coffee and head out to work.  And also, of course, buy a few Powerball tickets here and there.  Soledad.  Let's hear it.  Allison Kostic, if you win, remember, you and me, we're a team, girl.  Thanks, Allison, for the update.  We appreciate it.  Take a live-looking Zion. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, boy.  On the way in, 10-10 wins.  They had one of those guys, and they go, if I'm not here tomorrow, you know why.  Back to you.  Oh, shut up.  There was like, oh, we talked with a cabbie who we saw playing the numbers.  What did you do?  I would still drive cab, but maybe buy a new house, new car, but I enjoy a drive cab.  There's not one guy that enjoys driving his cab. 
[00:50:00]  No.  The hours those fuckers have to put in, it's amazing.  You ever talk to those guys?  No.  I try not to.  Are you scared to?  No, I'm not scared to.  They were annoying as fuck.  They basically can't take a day off, and they work about 16-hour shifts.  Whoa.  And then they go home and have families.  It's like, how the fuck are you living a life?  With just chopped meat assholes, I'm sure, for just sitting on those fucking dumb bead things all day.  Maybe not 16 hours, but I think it's like 12-hour shifts.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  12-hour shifts, then you go home and try to raise your family for a little bit, and get some shut-eye, 
[00:50:30]  and then go back and drive again tomorrow.  Fuck that noise.  I would buy myself a really big apartment with all the trimmings and a big balcony.  Yeah.  I would have a party and have all of my new friends over.  New friends?  Who would they consist of?  Just highfalutin people.  Falutin.  I would have a bunch of highfalutin fans.  What a dumb thing. 
[00:51:00]  Falutin.  I would just hang out with, like, you know, real steppers.  Hobnob.  Yeah.  Ooh, puffy.  Oh.  Oh.  I have a big shindig.  That would be, um, that's a lot of fucking money.  What is it after, like, taxes when you take the ball?  $40?  $40 fucking bucks.  I mean, to get the $500 million, you have to, like, you know, be around for the next 50 years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's how they get you.  I think it's, like, what, $165 million?  Well, look up the fine print.  Yeah?  There's some fine print involved here. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, it's okay print.  I wouldn't call it hot.  If it's $500 million, why can't you just get the $500 million and go, look, I want my $500 million?  Well, you guys.  Oh, no, we're going to pay you $15,000 a year for the next 100 years.  They got it.  Whatever.  They got to tax it, too.  At least you're going to get the pre-fucking January 1st tax on it.  Or then they fuck you.  Some, all these assholes at the lottery office figured out this thing where, all right, we  could give you, you know, a lump sum now, but it's a lot less than the actual prize. 
[00:52:00]  The lump sum would be $327 million.  Oh, you know what?  That's not too shabby.  So?  But you're still losing $173 million for winning the $500 million Powerball.  And then that's taxed.  Oh, boy.  Is it ever?  Or, oh, boy, that's like, that's pretty much 50%, right?  You just take it.  You're still looking at over $100 million.  But why?  Now, what if you take 20 years of payout?  I might even, would you lose more in taxes if you took the 20-year payouts?  Was it 20 years?  I think so, yeah.  Probably, because wouldn't they tax it every year? 
[00:52:30]  Well, they're going to tax it here every year.  I mean, what about what you do with it?  Do you know, do you know, they also tax the money that you spent on the ticket?  Like, the government gets a cut of the money you spend on the ticket and everybody that  buys tickets?  Like, that money, the store has to pay taxes on that money.  It's disgusting.  And then they take half the fucking money you win.  It's like...  It's disgusting.  The taxing of the same money over and over again, it's astounding. 
[00:53:00]  And then we're talking about a fiscal cliff, really?  Yes, the fiscal cliff that we're falling off of and the fucking debt.  With all the money the government takes steals from us, how the fuck are they still in debt?  We're too busy fighting with each other when we all should be focusing on our government.  On the dumb government.  Whether you're a Republican or a Democrat, we all have to focus and go, what the fuck  are you guys doing?  Yeah.  Yeah, you can like a party better, fine.  But they're not...  They're fucking it up. 
[00:53:30]  Yep.  I was in an argument with some bitch on fucking Twitter, of course, about taxes, and she's  like...  She's the CEO of some fucking online clothing company or some shit, and she goes, I don't  mind my taxes.  I don't even mind if they would go up.  She goes, I call it giving back.  God, we've given enough.  And then my whole answer to it is, no, you're not giving.  They are taking.  There's not an option to give or not fucking give.  If you don't give, you go to jail. 
[00:54:00]  That's how you're giving?  Ugh.  Fucking twat.  Even with Romney, we would be paying way too many fucking taxes.  Like, he would have been the better choice for me personally, but there's a bigger problem  here.  We're still paying way too many fucking taxes, no matter which guy you were for.  And no one wants to tell me what my fair share should be.  Is it 70%?  Should I give $7 out of every $10 I earn, $7 should be handed over to the government? 
[00:54:30]  They're completely irresponsible with how they spend our fucking tax money.  And then just watch the debt go up even though you're paying more and more.  Right.  Look, see?  Fiscal cliffhanger.  There it is.  Look, man, the numbers for Black Friday were completely amazing.  So we're doing our jobs.  We're spending.  That's a horrid indicator because the prices went up.  Like they say, well, record amounts of money were spent.  It's because the prices of everything went up.  Secondly, a lot of people shopped on Black Friday because they were getting a deal or they 
[00:55:00]  felt they were getting a discount.  And in these rough economic times, people will go for the discount.  Right.  So that's why they went in droves.  It's a lot of people twist it around to make it sound like, well, the economy can't be  that bad because there were record sales.  Yeah.  Record sales because the prices are up and people are clamoring to get fucking what they think  is a discount, which usually isn't.  It's just disgusting.  It is.  We should not be talking about a fiscal cliffhanger.  Fiscal cliff.  Or cliff. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  They call it a fiscal cliff.  You got the fiscal cliffhanger.  I mean, how much?  How much?  How much?  This is what it's going to take.  Yeah.  How much?  The problem is it'll be that number and then it'll go up again because they'll fuck  up spending the money.  And then it's well.  And also they're going to be, you know, thank God they're going to cut this bloated military.  It's like, where do you think that some of these jobs come from?  What jobs are going to replace when you cut the military?  What jobs are going to replace the bases that bring money into some of these towns and 
[00:56:00]  cities, the weapons industries, the fucking widget industry that makes a part that goes to this fucking item?  Like, where do you think those jobs are going to go?  What if we pull our people in from overseas, like, from Germany and all these places we don't belong and put bases here?  Or, like, Ron Paul, I think, is just about filtering that money back into the economy here instead of spending it in the German economy.  Yeah, but it never makes it that far.  I would love to see what Obama was talking about, like, rebuilding the American infrastructure and using a lot of this money that's coming in for these big projects that we don't do anymore, like the fucking dams and bridges and shit like that. 
[00:56:30]  But it just never happens.  The money disappears.  There's never any accountability as to where the fuck it went.  So you sit here and go, all right, we're trillions in debt, and where is it going?  And you pay the highest taxes in the country, and it takes 12 days to get your power back on. 
[00:57:00]  And they're firing executives.  Like, that's why people are – if all of a sudden you paid more, and holy shit, things are a little bit better.  You wouldn't be as pissed off.  You wouldn't be as pissed off.  Yeah, yeah.  But you see zero improvement.  Zero being done.  Zero.  Yeah.  And not just the federal taxes, mind you.  It's not just the federal fucking – because everybody's talking about federal income tax and payroll tax and whatnot.  That, combined with your state taxes, your local taxes, property taxes, sales tax – 
[00:57:30]  City taxes.  City tax.  Yeah.  You pay city taxes.  I got an extra fucking tax bill because I live in Manhattan.  You are absolutely giving more than half of your money to some government entities.  I got state, federal, and city.  And then to be smacked in the face by these motherfuckers telling you you're not doing enough.  Dude, half your money.  More than half.  I understand.  Your shit is being paid away.  Every buck you have, take two quarters if you're lucky.  I understand.  25% of your money is enough. 
[00:58:00]  If they can't make do with 25% of everybody's money.  Everybody's cash.  25% of it.  Now work with it.  Make it work, fucker.  Then they should be violently overthrown.  Yes.  Yes.  That is literally – if they can't do it with a quarter of all the money we earn, that should be the only answer.  People in India – and I'll never forget this story.  They dragged – it was a company CEO.  They dragged him out in the street and they beat him to death.  I forget what he had done.  Was it some thievery?  Yes.  He did that a few times.  Guess what?  Things might change. 
[00:58:30]  These fucking –  A few people are beaten to death in the street with fucking sticks and they will stop fucking with our money.  The government fucking bigwigs, Congress, all these motherfuckers.  They are not doing their jobs.  Back to your point with that person you were talking to on Twitter.  Yeah, yeah.  Everyone should feel this way.  This is not a rich man's conversation.  Right.  You dummies.  It's – they've split it up into – you know, I hate using the catchphrase class warfare, but it is. 
[00:59:00]  Because when we're arguing with each other about this shit, we're not looking at the actual problem, which is government run amok.  Overspending.  As far as spending, irresponsible spending, backroom buddy deals to fucking get money into their states for nothing, for votes.  They're paying for votes by promising money to go to these projects that really don't do anything. 
[00:59:30]  It's infuriating.  And a solution every single time we've got to raise taxes.  Every single time.  Every fucking time.  How much can we save each person if we – or say we stop giving money to Egypt, to Israel, to every other – I can – those are the only two I can think of that we give huge amounts to.  Yeah.  How about if we stopped giving fucking money to these countries?  How about if we stopped – right there, you cut that hunk out.  We stopped trying to buy influence in the UN and all over the planet.  Do you realize also – this is fucking ridiculous – that the taxes that they want to impose on people making $250,000 a year and more after January 1st will take care of eight days of government spending. 
[01:00:00]  Eight days.  That's it.  It takes care of eight fucking days of government spending.  It's not doing anything.  It's not doing anything.  But what it will do is disenfranchise the taxpayer.  It will inject uncertainty into the future of small businesses and big businesses to the point where they will think about hiring and not hire. 
[01:00:30]  It just throws a fucking wrench into people's confidence.  Why are we even talking about this?  I don't know.  I don't know.  You're right.  Why?  Nothing changes.  Nothing.  We could yell and scream.  We have this fucking platform, but it will be the same shit.  You know what?  As I'm sitting here, I'm like, wow, we've had this conversation probably a hundred times.  Crazy.  Probably. 
[01:01:00]  Over the years, probably a hundred times.  We're all saying the same shit we've said many, many times.  But how can they not make money if they're taking half your lottery winnings in every state?  All this money they're taking and these cocksuckers can't make it work.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A 25% is all you should have to pay.  I mean, Forbes suggested a 17% tax for every person.  Of course, that's not fair, I guess.  People said that wasn't fair.  It's not fair to tax everybody in this country. 
[01:01:30]  How about this?  The more taxes you pay, the more votes you get.  How about that?  There you go.  If I got to pay three times or five times the tax to somebody else, how about I get five times the votes that I wouldn't use?  But how about that?  Oh, that's not right.  But the other guy is just not going to be that much better in the end.  So there's a bigger problem than which side you're on.  I'm sorry.  Well, you need another party, a third party.  You need a third party.  You know what?  I'm sorry.  It's just going to take a bloody fucking coup to really shake this system up. 
[01:02:00]  They're so comfortable knowing, knowing they can do this shit with impunity.  Why would you change the way it works when you could go to work, you're a congressman, you go to work, you sit on your fucking fat ass, you push your pencil around, you make money for your state, you know, it goes to your buddy deals and whatnot, and you can just keep dipping into everyone's pocket.  Why would you change that when you know you're not going to step outside and get a fucking mob with pitchforks surrounding you? 
[01:02:30]  It just isn't going to happen.  And they know it.  Yeah.  So year after year, they just fuck you over and over again, knowing that nothing's going to change.  Congrats.  Half of the people don't give a shit about taxes because they don't pay them anyway.  Right.  And they're the ones that are saying that we're not doing our fair share.  The people that don't pay any fucking taxes.  I don't understand that one.  I don't either.  Most of my life I was poor, and I always paid taxes. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  How do you get that gig?  How do you get the gig where you don't pay taxes?  Well, you go on the government take on the till.  That's a good one.  It must be nice.  It's got to be amazing.  Why didn't we do that?  I don't know.  There were times I probably could have used, probably, I absolutely could have used the  help.  It was great.  I used to get a refund, a tax refund, but it wasn't as much as I put in. 
[01:03:30]  You know?  Like, I would always be like, oh, cool, I'm getting like 800 bucks back.  I forgot about the tax refund.  Yeah, remember the refund?  That was nice.  That was free money.  It was like, holy shit.  All right.  Fucking A.  And I would responsibly put it in the bank.  Yeah, right.  And then, I would.  You would.  I would put it in the bank, and then within a week, I had withdrawn it all at the ATM.  I didn't even have a bank account well into my 20s.  Yeah?  Yeah.  No, you know what?  I mean, technically, maybe I had one.  I don't even remember.  But I certainly didn't have anything in it. 
[01:04:00]  No, this was after I was married, because, of course, the wife wanted me to have an account  so she could fucking take it from me when the shit hit the fan, as they say.  Fucking cunt.  I just hide my money now.  Yeah.  Behind dolls and shit.  Hide that shit.  Just hide your thing.  No, you can't.  They're entitled to their take.  Yeah, exactly.  They're entitled because they've done nothing for it.  No, I'm talking about from the government.  Yeah, no, I know.  That's what I'm saying.  And they've done nothing for it, but they should have the 50% take.  It's fair.  And then you get people that are saying, you know, do your fair share and stuff, and 
[01:04:30]  then they bitch about offshore accounts, like, oh, this company, they took their money and  they put it offshore.  Why the fuck wouldn't you?  When you're being fucked over, like you are in this country when you're successful, why  the fuck wouldn't you leave your money somewhere else where they can't get to it?  And it's fake anger, because no matter what level you're at, you finagle and try to figure  out your shit.  All these people, you're not doing your fair share.  You wouldn't use every inch of tax law to pay as little as possible. 
[01:05:00]  That's what everyone does every year.  Why do you think we have accountants?  When I was making $40,000 a year, I always found the shady accountant.  Exactly.  And everyone else does the exact same thing, and you figure out, what can I get away with  writing off?  Right.  You would write off dumb shit that absolutely you didn't need for your job.  What about your clothes for the year?  Right.  How much did you spend on clothing?  Wear and tear on the car.  Wear and tear.  Put that down on your tax form.  I was sitting in front of my accountant with every beer and liquor shirt I got for free, 
[01:05:30]  and I'm writing off fucking like I was buying Armani suits.  Armani, Jerry.  That's why it's just fake anger from these idiots when they hear about the rich guys  doing it.  We're doing the same thing.  Doing the same thing.  In your own way.  And then they talk about like Romney or something.  I'm just using him as an example.  How many times?  Not paying his fair share of taxes.  They think he's going to a nine to five job and paying taxes on that.  He doesn't work.  His taxes come from things like capital gains, investments, shit like that, which is taxed 
[01:06:00]  at a different level no matter how much he's making from it.  But they're bitching about that.  Who's Romney?  He was a guy a few years back, I think.  He was running for governor of some state.  I don't know.  Where has he been?  What happens to a guy like that?  He fucking takes a breath and relaxes and says, thank God I didn't win that godforsaken job.  He probably didn't even want it in the end.  No one wants that job. 
[01:06:30]  Why would you want that job?  It's the thrill of being the candidate and winning.  Obama's aged 20 years and four.  Oh, man.  He's going to look like an old grandpappy when the job's done with that tuft of cotton on  his chin and two tufts of cotton over his ears.  I remember back in I was a two double on eight when I was elected president of these United States.  The presidents, they age, I don't know, like a lot.  Yeah.  I'm trying to put a number on it.  And then when they leave office, you know, they get a couple years back. 
[01:07:00]  They go back a little bit and get a little of their youth back.  Yeah.  You read about Clinton today?  What did he do?  Remember that Jennifer, what was her name?  Flowers.  Jennifer Flowers.  Jennifer Flowers.  Jennifer Flowers went on some show.  It's one of the big stories in the paper today.  Oh, boy.  And she said that Bill Clinton gave her a booty call around a year after his horse surgery. 
[01:07:30]  2005.  Really?  And she says, the whole transcript's in there.  And she basically said, you know, you can't come over to my house.  And he's like, I'll put a hoodie on and I'll run over.  Do you think this is true?  Yes.  What a cunt to go blabbing.  I know.  I think it's fucking blabbing.  I saw the article right in front of you there, Jimmy.  I did not see it.  She's a blabbermouth.  What a cunt.  Blabbermouth.  Because she's worthless without his cock in the equation.  Right.  Supposedly in 2000.  Oh, here it is.  Bimbo.  I absolutely believe it.  Bimbo of 92 is the headline. 
[01:08:00]  Horny Bubba rang twice.  Bill asked to put on hoodie and call on Jennifer years later.  I believe it.  Let's see.  Okay.  On Monday, Flowers told WGNO, a New Orleans TV station,  the former commander in chief called her home a year after he had quadruple bypass surgery.  And just days after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Crescent City.  I said, no, you can't come over here.  No way.  I said, you can't come to my house. 
[01:08:30]  Come on, old times.  She was sipping wine as she was saying this.  I guess they do some kind of show called Twist Bar at WGNO.  She said Clinton insisted I'll put on a hoodie and I'll jog up there.  A hoodie.  I was taken aback, she added.  That was the last thing I expected.  He still has Secret Service protection.  How the fuck is he supposed to put on a hoodie and get away from them?  Get away from them.  You think he just says, hey, be cool asshole.  She's a cunt.  Those guys are made to keep their mouths shut.  Yeah.  Oh, those guys know some shit. 
[01:09:00]  Of course.  And she said, I want you to leave me alone.  Oh, shut up.  So why are you still talking about it, bitch?  Exactly.  Shut up.  Yeah, why?  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  Oh, man.  You know what?  Clinton can't do anything that besmirches him anymore.  He's so fucking...  Like, he's so...  Like, cool.  Everyone loves him.  Everyone loves Clinton.  And this just keeps the legend going, you know?  No one's like, oh, that's terrible. 
[01:09:30]  Fuck it.  He's the next president who's fucking still going out there.  You think it's true?  Yes.  I absolutely believe it.  But her?  I would assume if you're the ex-president, you could get some mad pussy.  Dude, she might be the only one that's yapping.  He probably went through all of his chicks that night.  Oh, okay.  And she's like the last one on the list.  Okay.  Yeah.  He might just be like any of us.  He probably still jerks off to certain memories.  Just a dog.  Yeah, and he's like, goddammit, she was a good fuck. 
[01:10:00]  The way she licked my balls.  Or maybe she would fucking deep-throat him and make a noise that he liked.  So you think it's true?  I'm going to give her a call.  I'm going to.  Oh, God.  And he's just like, beep, boop, boop, beep.  Yeah.  Hi.  How does the next president put a hoodie on?  A hoodie.  And jog on a hoodie.  That would be great.  Oh.  Yeah, like Lincoln did that years ago.  Right.  I'll put on a short hat and come over.  Because he wore that big one.  I don't understand.  Oh, Jiminy Cricket. 
[01:10:30]  It's probably, too, that he's fucking just, it's hard for him to go out and get laid because  every move he makes is documented on Twitter and Facebook.  Do we have the video of this?  You can't text?  This is something we should play on our show today.  If it was on WGNO, it's got to be out there somewhere.  Can we find that?  Do you realize there's no video or news stories or pictures or anything of any interaction  between him and Hillary?  Like, there's no interaction between those two.  They got a marriage of convenience.  But it's not even that anymore. 
[01:11:00]  Like, those marriage of conveniences are usually so they have photo ops and they could, you  know, video with each other together and like, all right, let's put on a fucking show  for these people this week.  I would assume she can't stand him.  That's why she took the job to travel the world.  I would assume they both can't stand each other.  But, yeah, she took the job to fucking just be away from him.  I think the last time you saw him as sort of a couple was at the daughter's wedding  there.  Yeah, yeah.  Chelsea's wedding, right?  You got it?  So, this is the audio of it.  I love this.  I love the twist bar.  Isn't it cool? 
[01:11:30]  I watch you guys all the time.  No, we didn't.  And I love that you're so relaxed and casual.  It's just so different.  She looks all right.  Well, I like this.  It's just like having two chicks talking, right?  It is.  Two chicks talking.  I wanted to find out from you, especially with the news lately.  Are they going to start dancing to some rhythm and blues?  Yeah.  We wouldn't serve you cheap wine, right?  I appreciate it.  Oh, this show looks awful.  Oh, God, is this terrible?  This is all over the place.  Well, I think that it amazes me that this type thing continues to happen.  Is she the expert for powerful people fucking? 
[01:12:00]  What does she look like?  I think it's very unfortunate.  Courtney Love.  A very bloated, old Courtney Love.  But it doesn't really surprise me.  I just kind of feel like there's always something like that around the corner.  She's got the Chris Jericho jizz fountain hairdo.  I like that.  Like there was a giant puffed up list, right?  There was several corners.  I was thinking it was about 20 years ago that you announced publicly that you and Bill Clinton  had had an affair, and he was running for president, and it kind of rocked the campaign  a little bit.  It didn't affect the election, obviously. 
[01:12:30]  Because I made him a household name overnight, you see.  Oh, is that it?  We had that discussion.  Taking credit for the presidency.  You and Bill, Bill, that he said my problem right now is that no one knows who I am.  Is she trying to say that Bill was like, yeah, go forward with this?  I need some juice?  Yeah.  No fucking way.  In what?  92, right?  92.  No way did they have that discussion.  What is she, fucking nuts?  Yeah, could you please tell everyone that I fucked around on my wife because I'm running 
[01:13:00]  for president?  There's no way that went down.  No.  I need that name recognition.  No.  And he said, you know, Kerry's got the Hollywood vote, and he went on to, you know, talk about  the other candidates and, you know, the advantages they had.  Were you sucking his cock at the time?  I'm serious.  I'm very serious.  Yoo-hoo!  My story came out.  He was a household name overnight.  Pause.  Come on.  I believe that.  The scandal did get him into the public. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  That's taking a major risk.  Right.  You're going for the presidency, you know, especially in 92.  Yeah, when you look at people like fucking, what's his name, Gary Hart.  Right.  What a sex scandal did to him pre-election.  Late 80s, was that?  Like, during the primaries.  Yeah.  Wasn't that 88, I guess?  It totally fucked his whole thing up.  Right.  Like, why would you, a sex scandal during the primaries just sinks you.  Yeah, I don't know, man.  And with the well-thought-out campaign that Clinton put on, there's no way you'd get a 
[01:14:00]  like a Stephanopoulos that would write off on, hey, what a great strategy.  Let's fucking say that you fucked around on your wife.  Clinton came out of nowhere.  Yeah.  Or it kind of seemed that way.  No, he didn't.  He came from a little town called Hope.  That whole fucking rigmarole.  All right, go back to this.  Experience is not easy for me.  I will start by explaining why I came forward to tell my story.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. 
[01:14:30]  I really thought that coming out and telling the truth would set me free, but it didn't.  When was the last time you talked to him?  Well, I talked with him actually after I got a divorce and I moved into my home in Old Metairie.  It was after Katrina, and I was at home by myself.  And the phone rang.  It said unavailable.  And I picked up the phone, and it was him.  And he wanted to come by my house and talk to me. 
[01:15:00]  Wait, this sounds unbelievable.  No, it doesn't.  Well, I thought it was, too.  I was taken back.  I did not.  That was the last thing I expected.  Well, how would he find you there?  Are you kidding?  They know.  I mean, he was before the president.  Hold on.  This broad's nuts.  I'm sorry.  Obviously.  Yeah, yeah.  That's like he used some type of government agency to get her number.  Do you think it would be hard for Clinton to get her number, though?  It probably wouldn't be, but would he go through those channels? 
[01:15:30]  I don't think she's lying about this.  I think this probably happened.  I'm not saying that Clinton doesn't have it in him, but why would...  I don't know.  Why wouldn't he just fucking go somewhere else with that shit?  Maybe because with her, again, she might have been a great bang, and he's older, and he  just wanted to...  Sometimes you want to go back and just hit that again, and she's just a fucking glabber-mouth  old lady.  Ew!  Yeah, exactly.  Sam.  If you will. 
[01:16:00]  Things like that.  I mean, he has all these resources.  Race horses?  So what did he say?  No, you can't come over here?  I said, no, you can't come over here.  No way.  I said, you can't come to my house.  Come.  And he said, oh, yeah, he said, I'll put on a hoodie, and I'll jog up there.  Well, he used to do that.  I know.  I said, no, no, and I want you to leave me alone.  Oh, shut up.  And that was it.  That would have been 2005.  You know, you are actually, in fact, we checked, we Googled you, and you are on the list of the  top ten hottest presidential wives and mistresses of all time. 
[01:16:30]  Did you know that?  No, I didn't know that.  You're there with Marilyn Monroe, of course, Kennedy's alleged mistress.  Right.  She was his mistress, dummy.  Do you ever get past that?  I mean, what would you say to the Paula Broadwell and the Jill Kelly that are currently in this  Petraeus-Allen scandal?  I'd say good luck.  That's her.  She actually just.  You better buck it up, because it's going to be one heck of a bullock.  She said that Clinton fucking called her to make a booty call, and that'll put a hoodie 
[01:17:00]  on.  I don't know.  I'm not buying it.  I'm just not buying it.  I totally believe it.  But, yeah, I think she's a twat.  Oh, yeah.  Is it reasonable?  Yeah.  I don't.  I don't.  I bought it at first, because I wouldn't put it past Clinton, but there's too many things  there that's.  I'm bothered by the list.  Top ten hottest wives slash mistresses.  Yeah.  First of all, you have to say none of the wives make the list.  No.  Except for what? 
[01:17:30]  Jackie Kennedy there, right?  Jackie O.  No.  Jackie O.  I don't know.  She didn't make the list, but who else had a hot fucking wife?  President?  Yes.  Some people would say George W., but she had a GoFunny eye.  Oh, um, I forgot her name already.  Laura, right?  Laura Bush.  Laura Bush.  This is the list?  I'm not sure.  This is the...  This is...  Helen Heron Taft is a hottie?  The ten hottest presidential wives in Mr. Seat.  Helen Heron Taft?  Helen...  Look at her hair. 
[01:18:00]  That's a wacky...  She's a fucking bird's nest.  She's awful.  She's wearing a bird's nest.  Let's look at her for a minute.  What are her stats?  Yeah.  Old fucking...  Helen...  What is it?  Heron.  Helen Heron Taft.  Is a hottie?  Old fatty Taft used to like her tits.  Oh, my God.  What do they say about her?  Do you know the bush she must have?  Oh, just...  Holy shit. 
[01:18:30]  All the way up to her spine.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I can't really imagine what lived in the bushes back then.  She didn't smile a lot.  She didn't smile a lot.  But she had nice eyes.  She's not smiling at all.  She probably had rotten teeth.  Nice eyes.  What are they talking about?  That's a rough photo right there.  If you got rid of the bird's nest on the top of her head, you would swear that's a guy.  If you just looked at the face.  Coming in at number 10, it's Helen Heron Taft.  What a fucking scary thing.  Let's go to...  This proves my point.  Grace Coolidge. 
[01:19:00]  Hey, all right.  Let me look at Grace Coolidge.  Calvin was doing all right for himself.  Calvin was sticking her ass.  Yeah.  All right.  You know, I never knew there was even a Grace Coolidge.  She's not bad.  What do they say about her?  Just that there's just something about her that draws you in.  And she was one of the founding members of Pi Beta Phi.  Bruce Willis in Pulp Fiction, by the way, his last name in the movie was Coolidge.  And he rode away on a motorcycle named Grace. 
[01:19:30]  What?  Oh, a little...  That's a little...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A little Quentin Tarantino thing right there.  You know he did that on purpose.  Probably did.  Wow, Grace Coolidge.  Not too bad.  She looks like a celebrity.  Now, go back to Helen Heron.  Helen Heron Taft.  Come on.  Look at the difference between us two.  Helen Taft looks like a bitch on wheels.  Oh, fuck.  You think she's a bit icy?  Oh, God.  Is she a cold, frigid bitch?  All right.  We'll give it to Grace Coolidge.  Thumbs up on the Grace Coolidge.  Grace Coolidge so far is holding it at number nine. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, my God.  Louisa Adams.  Adams.  She looks like Eric Idle.  She's horrible looking.  Now, it's hard to tell from a pencil sketch.  Yeah, but you can make someone look a little better.  Why are they trying to be interesting by going back so far?  Yeah, you can't go back that far.  No one really knows what she looks like.  What do they say about her?  That John Adams was 30 when he married her at 22.  Nice.  She was a looker, especially for the early 1800s.  Especially for the early 1800s.  Especially for the early 1800s. 
[01:20:30]  She sucks with her big neck.  Yeah, she does have a horrible neck.  Yeah, she stinks.  All right, move on.  All right.  Jennifer Flower.  Yeah, she was good looking there.  I mean, I understand why he would fuck her.  Yeah, but my point is being made here that there's not a lot to choose from.  That's true.  The curve is six.  Jane Wyman.  Jane Wyman.  Yes.  Ronald Reagan's wife.  Oh, was he married to her?  Yes.  Oh, yeah, he was.  That was, well, he divorced her.  Jane Wyman.  To marry the bobblehead.  I like that fucking moe haircut fucking bangs she's sporting there. 
[01:21:00]  That was the thing, I guess.  I guess it was.  All right, let's move on.  All right.  Judith Exner.  You know what?  This is not bad.  She ain't bad.  Who is she?  Who is she banging?  Had to be the 70s.  Because I'm positive we don't have a president named Exner.  She's sucking on tricky dick.  It's one of John F. Kennedy's many flings.  Oh, Judith Exner.  Really?  Oh, Judith Exner.  Won't you cut my balls? 
[01:21:30]  Judith Exner.  Won't you tongue out my shitter?  Won't you lick Mimi Beardsley?  It's got them both.  Yeah.  Won't you serve as Dave Powers, Judith Exner?  Judith Exner.  Yeah, JFK.  The best.  Blaze Star.  Who's this bitch?  All right, look at this.  Wow.  Wait.  She's in some kind of a leopard bikini thing playing a conga drum.  Has to be.  Is Kennedy again?  That's got to be Kennedy again?  Is that Kennedy again?  That fucking whore hog? 
[01:22:00]  You know what?  Jacqueline Kennedy stinks.  What a cuck she was.  She sucks.  She was pretty, too.  I mean, she'll be number one.  Not one of these chicks.  There was a Congo line of broads going through the White House, and she, what, just looked  the other way?  Yeah.  Who was this broad?  Where did she come from?  She was a sexy burlesque dancer.  I'll say.  Look at her.  Let's Google image Blaze Star.  Wow.  Jack was fucking this.  She was Blaze Star.  That's all right, man.  Blaze Star.  Uh-oh.  Something tells me she went into the later years and didn't retire. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, my God.  I see some color pictures.  This is, she's got, she's a Bucsonic.  She is a Bucsonic.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Look at the tits on her.  She's got those big and heavy.  Bucsum Blaze Star.  Yeah, man.  Jack would be sweating through her shirt.  He'd take it off and suck those monstrous tits.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Blaze Star was Bucsum. 
[01:23:00]  The Bucsonic.  Blaze, why don't you service my little brother?  Oh, yeah.  She's all right.  I mean, the face, not so much, but.  B-movie queen right there.  But she was built for sex.  Oh, Blaze Star.  Won't you finger my duty hold?  Blaze Star.  Won't you muss up my hair?  But not like Oswald.  Muss it with your hands.  Wow.  Look at the nipples pointing completely south.  Oh, Jesus.  Ew.  Is that later years?  Those tits are long and wrong. 
[01:23:30]  Long and wrong.  We used to call them long and wrong.  Damn it.  All right.  Oh, Blaze Star.  Let's move on to three.  Jane Mansfield.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  Who had Jane Mansfield?  Is that Kennedy again?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking dog.  Yeah.  She also won.  She came in third here, but she was hottest on the decapitated mistress list.  She came in numbers one through ten.  Number one.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  Kennedy again, huh? 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  Kennedy fucked every hot chick.  Well, women look at Jacqueline Kennedy as a powerful woman.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  She was a loser.  Jesus.  Jackie Kennedy is number two.  Aw.  She was pretty for a presidential wife.  Her eyes were too far apart.  Jackie Bouvier.  Would you?  Everyone.  Diddle my taint.  Jackie Bouvier.  Won't you put on that pillbox hat?  Jackie Bouvier.  Won't you hold in my brains?  Jackie Bouvier.  I know what I'm saying. 
[01:24:30]  And, of course, number one's got to be Marilyn, right?  Marilyn.  Of course.  Happy birthday.  So in the top ten list of hottest mistresses slash first ladies, how many are associated  with Kennedy?  Four, but it should be more probably.  Four.  One, two, three, four, five.  The top five.  The top of all of them.  And he could have fucked Jane Wyman if he wanted to, I'm sure.  I'm sure.  Oh, jeez.  And I guarantee you there's other...  I'll put Mimi Beardsley above this fucking monster. 
[01:25:00]  Helen Herrentoft.  Won't you eat my ass?  Yes.  Helen Herrentoft.  Won't you punish a Negro?  Helen Herrentoft.  That's Mimi Beardsley right there, right?  Yeah.  Look how pretty she was.  Let me see.  I would fucking put Mimi Beardsley in there.  Yeah.  Mimi's got to be...  Not for name, but...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look at her.  Very...  Girl necklace.  Yeah.  Very girl next door.  That was the 60s.  Yeah. 
[01:25:30]  Wobble-dum-ble.  What does she look like now?  Is that really...  That's her?  Mimi Beardsley.  I tell you, though, you imagine walking around knowing, like, every time you see the Zapruder  film, you know what that guy's cock tasted like and what it felt like to have his balls  on your cheek.  Like, she's literally...  Every time she sees that film, it's a guy she fucked for a year and a half.  I think his brain's blown out.  Why is Jim Norton part of the Google Images for Mimi Beardsley?  Oh, well, come on.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Jim's right up there with Mimi Beardsley. 
[01:26:00]  That's awesome.  That's great.  I'm in the Me, JFK, and Mimi.  Yep.  Watch your service, my friend Jim Norton.  He likes his fat chin tickled.  Now, nowadays, everyone in the press is pretty much an asshole.  Well, you're trying to tell me back then there wasn't one asshole in the press that  spoke of this?  No.  Isn't that strange to think?  I wonder if it was...  Kenny had a lot of women and not one of those press people were, you know, an asshole enough 
[01:26:30]  to say something.  Hey, Samuel, hit that face on Mimi Beardsley shot to the right.  Hurry up.  Up there.  Yeah, that one.  Boss is talking.  Let me see that.  Yeah, you know what?  She's got that...  She's got just youth on her side.  She's all right.  Can you make it bigger, sweetie?  I don't think she's...  She beats Helen fucking Heron Taft.  Of course.  I bet she does.  But that's someone trying to be too cool for the room.  Yeah, look at her.  Adding her to the list.  That's not even a good picture of her.  That's girl next door-ish.  My putt is hard.  Yeah.  I get a fucking...  She's fucking by the pool. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  Sucking off fucking JFK.  And Dave Power.  She's the bomb in the pool.  Yeah.  Suck my buddy.  You know how powerful you are when you fucking de-virginize a chick in the way  and then you have her suck your friend off in the pool?  That's crazy.  While his feet are dangling in the water?  What power?  Imagine Mimi Beardsley's dad is the one that arranged the whole assassination for deflowering  his fucking...  His girl.  His little girl.  You know, there was a guy at school that you liked and liked her?  Yeah. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  Did she come back smelling like his cologne?  Some fucking school love that ended the whole thing and all this speculation about  the mafia and the Cubans and commies and everything and it's just some fucking guy that was  jilted by Mimi Beardsley.  Yeah, exactly.  Some guy named Tad.  Yes.  Very upset.  I want to know the real shit someday.  You know there's some real shit.  Real.  A real deal.  That's way better than what we're told.  What was his cologne?  Because she said she remembered the smell of his cologne.  He smelled good.  It was called cranium. 
[01:28:00]  Not the later brand he wore called Lead.  But is there another...  What was his cologne?  It has a number in it, I think.  Do they still make it?  I think they do.  Was it Chanel No. 5?  Vetiver by Creed?  No.  Creed?  Is Creed still around?  With head wide open.  With head wide open.  No, I feel it was cold. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, remember Creed?  Creed.  We had to play too much Creed.  They suck.  Yeah.  I don't know if they sucked.  Yeah, they did.  It's hard to say they sucked.  They had a couple fucking monster hits.  And he won the first fight.  Apollo.  Can we break?  Wow.  We haven't broken.  No.  Yeah, let's do that.  Dying for coffee and I can't drink it until tomorrow.  Why?  What's up?  I had my teeth whitened.  What's today?  Wednesday?  Monday afternoon.  I went for my cleaning and whitening. 
[01:29:00]  So for 48 hours, you shouldn't drink coffee.  Are you getting those pings of pain or whatever it's called?  For the first day I did, yeah.  Holy fuck.  What?  The shit they use gets in the crevices.  It pours, yeah.  And you have the most excruciating pain for a split second.  It's the only way to explain it.  I felt that a lot for the day.  Just when you're like, holy fuck, I can't handle this pain, it just goes away.  Oh.  But all day long, out of nowhere, it'll just go ping, ping, ping.  I had it on upper and lower, but I had it constant.  That's why I've never gotten it done again. 
[01:29:30]  It's worth it.  It's worth it because it's not agonizing.  You take an aspirin, you're okay.  And I got like, the first time I did it, there's three 10-minute sessions.  But I did two and like a minute into the third it started.  It hurts a little bit sometimes when you're getting it done.  But this time I went with all three, so the pain was a little worse.  But it's worth it.  It was fine by the end of the next day.  They don't tell you that happens, man.  It's, wow.  That pain is brutal.  Very well worth it.  But it's, you know, it's split second.  Look at my smile.  Dolly Parton is still around. 
[01:30:00]  Worth it.  Conversation.  Let's let people that like to bitch a lot talk about that stuff.  Well, there you go.  I don't believe it anyway.  Those people.  You people.  Yeah.  Out of your book, would you ever run for president?  I always say, and I'll say again, we've had enough boobs in the White House.  I read your book last night.  It is terrific.  Well, thank you.  Congratulations.  Check it out.  It premieres today.  It's called Dream More.  Celebrate the dreamer in you. 
[01:30:30]  Dolly Parton, also known as the Dolly Mama.  Yes.  The wisdom of the Dolly Mama.  Uh-huh.  That's where a lot of those fun things in the back are from.  It's very nice.  So this makes a nice Christmas present.  Wraps really easy.  Put it right in the stocking.  Good calls, too.  Yeah.  And you autographed the back of it, too.  Yeah.  Amazing.  Could you take us up on Brian's request to come?  We'd like to come down to Dollywood.  You know what?  You're always invited.  I've always invited all of you.  You just never can come when it's time.  How's the parking?  Is it possible?  The parking?  We'll get you in.  You'll get us in?  We'll make sure that you get in. 
[01:31:00]  I'll meet you at the Forks of the Road.  There's a lot of times you park so far away, you're exhausted by the time you get to the  Well, that's true.  But if we know you're coming, we'll take it.  All right.  Good to see Ollie.  I always enjoyed her in this show.  Thank you, Nick.  I'm looking her up right now.  She's that old?  68 or 70.  I'm looking her up right now.  And her work actually looks good compared to the way most women look her age.  She looks fucking good.  You know what?  Not as old as you would think.  Really?  She's been around forever.  22 years old.  She's only 66.  66!  She was a bit young when she started, I guess. 
[01:31:30]  Huh?  Maybe she's padding her age.  That's usual.  Dollywood.  Fucking who would go to Dollywood?  66.  66.  Christ on a pony.  That sounds like the biggest white trash trip.  I'd rather go to Branson and go see fucking Yakov.  And I prefer her version, by the way, of I Will Always Love You.  Right.  So let's have that glug part.  If it's a break, that would be...  Hey, what happens at Dollywood?  It's an amusement park.  You go on a fucking roller coaster, and you fucking... 
[01:32:00]  You go...  It's like Disney for fucking white trash.  Even though Disney's pretty white trash.  Oh, look at her camel toe from back in the day.  Oh, wow.  She was chunky back then.  What's she singing there?  Chunkwing.  Oh, this is great.  Look at that wig.  Auburn hair.  Oh, Jimmy knows this.  The wig stinks.  She's got a very cute face, though, huh?  Death of Spring.  Summer rain.  Oh, Jimmy.  Peek with you, Jolie. 
[01:32:30]  How does Jimmy know this?  This shit.  He talks about you when you sleep, and there's nothing I can do to keep up.  She's begging this girl not to take her fucking husband.  Her man.  Yeah.  He has a white stripes version.  You heard the white stripes version?  Oh, is that it?  You'd like it.  I don't like the white stripes.  I don't think they stink.  I just don't do anything.  Wait, Jolie does this song?  White stripes do this song.  Well, they used to do this song live, like, every show.  Oh. 
[01:33:00]  This song?  Yeah.  Your breath is so flat, summer rain.  Wait, there, Jolene, is this song?  Yeah.  Can I hear that?  It's amazing.  It's not better than hers.  Relax, Mr. Tattooed on your fucking...  Exactly.  We understand your little bias.  I have Dolly Parton tattooed on my arm.  White stripes are pretty good, though.  I didn't realize that was a Dolly Parton song.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I had no idea.  Pardon me.  Let me hear a little White Stripes.  Jolene.  Can't after that one.  No.  I want to hear that Jolene. 
[01:33:30]  Jolene.  Yeah, that's all they do is do it live.  Why did you find it before you rock?  Turn it up.  That was stupid.  Backing up you, please don't take my mind.  Jolene, Jolene, Jolene.  Let me kill it kicks in.  All right.  I want to kick you. 
[01:34:00]  I'm not taking it.  Wait till it kicks in.  It's okay.  Wait till it kicks in.  Yeah.  You don't have all day.  Yeah, you do.  All day?  You get to 10 o'clock.  That's true.  Corey in Tennessee.  We're not waiting.  Corey.  Keep it up like a little. 
[01:34:30]  Yes, Corey.  Hi, Corey.  Speak.  Yeah, I'm from Tennessee, and I just went to Dollywood for the first time last year.  As soon as you walk in, there's people in...  Dollywood.  ...like performers in overalls playing the banjo and the old milk jug.  Oh, really?  Are they raping fat people in the woods?  No, but there's plenty of them there.  They have a rascal checkout right by the main entrance.  I bet. 
[01:35:00]  I bet they do well with that rascal fucking rental.  Yeah.  It's...  You know, I was a little disappointed because all the people who...  And I don't know why.  They come from all over the country to go to Dollywood, and that's what they present  them with, is that image.  Well, that's exactly what is expected, though.  Fucking hillbilly shit.  It's Dollywood.  Dollywood.  It's just a little disappointing.  It sounds awful, to be honest with you.  With all the places you go, I don't know why you would pick that for your family vacation.  Jack White's version was okay. 
[01:35:30]  I didn't dislike it, but I prefer hers.  I have a theory about that song, and I could be totally wrong.  Yeah.  There's been speculation that she's a lesbian.  She said she wasn't.  I know, she did.  Just now.  But again, there's been speculation.  So to me, it sounded like that could almost be a love song to a woman.  Like, how else do you say these things about a woman?  Did she write it?  I'm pretty sure she did.  She was a good writer.  By the way, that never kicked in.  It just did what you were on the phone.  No, I don't think it did.  It didn't.  I don't think it did.  A minute ago, you said you liked it before you started playing it. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, boy.  Yeah, you're a fucking, she's saying all these lovely things.  Yeah, but that's a live version or something, right?  It's only a live version.  It's not an album.  Oh, then I just fucking lied to everybody.  Then I'm thinking of something else.  No, that's the song you were thinking of.  It's okay, but I think her version's better.  Her version.  And I like your theory.  That's interesting.  Yeah, because the way she's singing about this beautiful woman, all she's tying it in  with is he talks about you in his sleep.  Like, she's saying that the husband talks about it, but I always thought it was a love song  to another woman. 
[01:36:30]  Was she ever married?  Does she have kids?  Is she married now?  She may be straight.  It's just a theory.  I just remember a story she used to tell about growing up and being cold in the fucking  cabin, and she would piss in the bed to keep herself warm.  But that piss would get cold after a while.  I know, but I guess she would just piss, you know.  Ron's very mad.  She's been married since 66.  Oh, she has been?  Okay.  Dollywood rules. 
[01:37:00]  Ron, Dollywood rules?  Sorry.  Oh, I was wrong then.  Yeah, what's up?  Dude, the coolest thing, I'm telling you, I live in Jersey, and for the last three summers,  no shit, I've taken my family to Dollywood.  Here's why.  Why?  It's totally not like the shithole that all East Coast amusement parks are now, with  gang bangers and gang bangers and shitheads.  Dude, it's totally clean, old school America.  Just saying.  Anthony, it may be a majority of white people, I'm just saying.  It's got thrill rides. 
[01:37:30]  It's totally family.  And you know, I gotta say, Norton, me too, with the Dolly Parton thing, like Jolene, like  that piss in the bucket song, like Coat of Many Colors, it's just a strange thing.  She's cool, but I never was a fan or anything, and I don't own a pair of overalls, but I just  have gone there, and it's like totally, it's like a time machine back like 20 years.  I love that Mooney said Pryor used to fuck her, too.  What?  He said that she used to fuck Richard Pryor.  Again, that's Mooney who said that.  Who, Dolly Parton?  Yeah, that was what Mooney said. 
[01:38:00]  You know, the thing with Dolly Parton is you really don't know a lot.  Yeah.  Her love life and stuff, it's like a mystery.  Well, Sam says she's been married since 66.  Well, where's that guy?  Has he ever popped up?  Oh, that's the country singer guy.  Like, she was like, that was like her version of like Ike Turner, I think, or something.  Well, give us a picture of Dolly Parton's husband, if she's been married to him  since 66.  No, but she was with this other like country singer guy, yeah, and then she got married  to this secret guy that like you never see.  Who's this energetic?  You don't like him? 
[01:38:30]  I like this guy.  Too much energy.  This guy's very in front of me.  He might have turned us around on Dollywood.  Who's knocking my energy?  I'm driving a car and away at work.  It sucks, you know.  I'm all keyed up.  Wait, so she married, how long has she been with this guy?  No, sir.  Dude, it's got to be like at least 30, 40 years.  What does he look like?  Why have we never seen this guy?  No pictures of Dolly's husband?  Does he run Dollywood?  Like the yang to her yin or something.  How the hell has he avoided getting his picture taken since 1966?  He has that right, Sam. 
[01:39:00]  You know, the other thing is too, when you go there, the guy was talking about music,  she has like every member of her family doing the music shows in the park.  Oh, well, why wouldn't she?  Is she there?  She shows up randomly, like on golf carts every now and then.  She never goes to Dollywood.  Where is it?  She might go once a year.  It's very much like, yeah, like a clean appearance.  Like they have footage of her like waving to the masses on a golf cart.  Where is it?  She's gone there a few times in the life of that place. 
[01:39:30]  Where is it?  What, Dollywood?  Yeah.  It's in Tennessee.  I used to go to Opryland in Tennessee when it was open.  It's on, it's Eastern Tennessee.  Next time I see you, we'll be on Tennessee time.  Yeah, she doesn't go to Dollywood.  Are you kidding me?  She opened that joint, went one other time, and that's been it.  What year did that open?  86.  It was actually in other amusement parks.  This guy knows everything about it.  He's a biographer.  Dude, I'm telling you, I went nuts over it.  And I just, you know what it is?  I was listening to you guys, actually. 
[01:40:00]  I was driving out there at my family.  It's so funny.  But listening to you guys in Tennessee, totally different experience.  But I was going out there, and you know, you do Graceland, which is on the other side  of Tennessee.  I did that.  You slingshot back, like Kirk in Star Trek II.  Oh, I gotcha.  And you come in, and you hit Dollywood.  They didn't use the slingshot technique in Star Trek II, sir, around the con.  Yes, they did, because they had those heads.  Remember the heads floating?  Yep. 
[01:40:30]  He's right.  I think that was two.  No, you are.  It is two.  Yeah, I had a, yeah, you're right.  And like, they're like, rawr, you hear the voices, like, screaming.  God, we've, we've.  The fuck is wrong with you?  We've, we've, thank you, Ron.  You're terrific.  Ron-ay.  I mean, we've talked about a lot of stuff in the first two hours of the show, and this  is what gets the phones lit?  They all want to talk about Dolly Parton and her secret life.  Who's the Rathacon?  You made the point.  You educated him.  No, he said, yes, it was. 
[01:41:00]  He's right.  And other people are saying it was, no, it was fucking four, asshole.  It was two.  It talks about you in his sleep.  They had to go back and get the whales and bring them back to talk to the fucking probe.  Boo!  Oh, E-Rock just perked up.  Remember that bit?  Remember the E-Rock fucking whale bit?  Wasn't that on his honeymoon?  Yeah, it was.  Oh, it was terrible.  Dollywood's in a town called Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.  Pigeon Forge. 
[01:41:30]  Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.  That's a lovely place.  Everybody wants to talk about fucking Dolly Parton.  Dolly?  Scott in Tennessee.  Hey, I've lived here a long time, so I know all about it.  It's in Sevierville, where Pigeon Forge is just a little tourist trap town to get to the  Smoky Mountains, but it's a dump.  They also have a thing called Dolly's Splash Country, where you see every jailhouse, tattoo,  diabetic.  It's awful.  It's truly the wretched society. 
[01:42:00]  But she actually lives in Nashville, which is like three and a half hours away.  She never goes there.  And I used to have a painting crew out in Nashville, and we did her house a few times.  And they basically make them wait outside the gate.  And then whenever she's ready, her car comes, drives out, and she goes to another house  she has in Nashville.  And then the crew comes in, and her husband actually is there.  He's kind of like a foreman, so he really is there, but he's behind the scenes.  Oh, he's like the Roy Disney of Dollywood? 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, it's funny, because one of my buddies who was in the painting crew, they would spend  all day there.  And then as soon as it was time to go, they packed up and left, and then her car would  come and drop her off.  She wouldn't have any contact with anyone.  But she never goes to Dollywood, ever.  Remember when Sam said there's no studio version?  Oh, Sam, you've got to tap.  It's not an album.  This is the version I know.  It's better than playing. 
[01:43:00]  So he gets into it.  Please don't take my man.  I am.  Jolie, Jolie, Jolie.  Please don't take him, even though you can.  There you go.  That's good.  I like the white stripes.  Mentality Mag, thank you.  It wasn't as good as the version that we played a minute ago.  Mentality Mag's a good one to follow.  What?  It wasn't as good as the version we played a minute ago.  Oh, shove it up your ass. 
[01:43:30]  The one you just played?  Dolly's version is better.  Oh, yeah.  That's the best.  You can't even pretend to like the one that you just played better.  I kind of do like it.  You didn't even let it kick in.  It didn't need to.  It was the same song.  It was already kind of kicking in.  It wasn't at all.  Yeah, it was kind of kicking in already.  It was getting there.  No, it was kicking in from the start.  Yours was like a lot slower and weird.  Yeah, and his voice sounded weird.  He's being an artist, man.  He's on stage.  Hey, play the Conan O'Brien version of that.  It's amazing.  Of Jolene? 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  That white-striped it on Conan O'Brien.  Oh, okay.  You can just say Conan, sir.  I thought you meant Conan himself.  You have to see his whole name.  We thought it was the barbarian.  That version.  Jolene.  Ah, Jolene.  Jolene.  You want to know more about Dolly Parton?  Yes.  I guess she covers...  Hold on.  Patrick in Atlanta.  Patrick.  Yeah, Dolly Parton's covered in tattoos.  I'm pretty sure she's got full sleeves on each arm.  What?  She does not.  Just stop it. 
[01:44:30]  It's true.  My neighbor did some photography for one of her concerts.  Right.  And they told him up front, no pictures of her arms, and they review every photo before  he leaves.  Yeah, but everyone could go to a concert with their phones now.  Yeah.  So where are the pictures of her fucking full arms past?  What do they used to say about Mr. Rogers?  Yeah, but if you look at all of her performance pictures, she's got long sleeves, and she usually  wears like a glove that covers her knuckles and everything.  She's got tattoos all over her.  No, she doesn't.  She's older.  She probably doesn't want her old lady's skin being shown. 
[01:45:00]  Let me see.  I research it, man.  It's the truth.  We're looking right now at a picture of her with her arms showing.  But they can cover that up with makeup, to be honest.  You're wrong.  Yeah, but that's still...  But I mean, after all these years, someone would have got a picture of her tattoos.  Of course.  Dr. Steve has, or used to have, season tickets to Dollywood.  Oh, what is...  Ah, Dollywood.  Yeah, I like to go there, and I just help people who are in distress.  We'd go on the log flume.  It was, you know, a log in fluid.  Yeah, you'd go on there, and it's kind of a slow build. 
[01:45:30]  And then it takes off and goes down quickly.  He'd probably sell his fucking swill there.  Yeah, his swill.  Dr. Steve's home potion.  Yeah, sold exclusively at Dollywood.  Battery acid and cum.  When we were talking about Moonshine, he's a big Moonshine guy.  Oh, Ixnay.  Oh, really?  I don't know.  No, I think when he makes me this shit, he wants to talk about me.  You're able to fucking make a little Moonshine on your own.  Dr. Steve, call us about your Moonshine. 
[01:46:00]  Boardwalk Empire is about me.  Matt in Westchester.  Boardwalk Empire.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up, Matt?  Hey, Matt.  Oh, yeah, my mom, she's in her late 60s.  She's been obsessed with Dollywood and wants to go there so bad.  So we're actually flying her there for Christmas.  By herself?  Yes.  No, hiring her, my mom and my stepfather.  I just imagine a place with a lot of mosquitoes. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, right?  Doesn't it sound like it's just too close to a swamp or something?  Yes, yes.  They got the land cheap for Dollywood.  It sounds awful.  And the funniest, the other day she brings it up.  She goes, oh, I hear Branson, Missouri is amazing.  Well, that I want to go to, yes.  Don't fuck with that place.  Yakov's Dinner Adventure.  Would you go there?  Oh, I would go to Yakov's Dinner Adventure in a second.  We have to go there.  I would love to go to Yakov's Dinner Adventure. 
[01:47:00]  Why don't we just out of nowhere just go to Branson for a weekend?  That'd be great.  Fly out on Friday, come back.  We should do it.  Sitting in those fucking seats with the magnetic trays and genuine linen napkins and vegetable  metal.  Why don't we just do it?  Fantastic.  Well, we have a possible thing coming up we should use.  Yes, maybe.  Maybe that could be one of our stops.  Oh, yes.  Branson.  Bill in Virginia.  More info on Dolly Parton.  Brady Brunch.  Hey, Dolly won't climb Mount Everest with only one boot on.  See ya. 
[01:47:30]  That guy sounded like the genuine article.  And is there really Kennywood?  Or is this guy just...  For Kenny Rogers?  Is this guy just fucking with us?  It's for Club Soda Kenny.  Oh.  Bunch of dunderheads.  In a hayfield.  Ride the moron.  It's like a big roller coaster.  Get a dunce hat when you walk in.  Please leave all personalities at the door.  There is a Kennywood.  Oh, yes.  Travis, what do you know about Kennywood?  All I know is I drive by it. 
[01:48:00]  The signs are up every summer.  It's in Virginia or West Virginia.  It's Kennywood.  It's got his face stretched out like crazy on the billboard.  That's all I know, but it is there.  What do you do?  Do you drive by it when you're on your way to the antihistamine factory?  Or like his uncle histamine, too.  Oh, my God.  You're fucking too much.  Blow your nose, cocksucker, before you're hauling.  Wait, what do you drop? 
[01:48:30]  You're in need of a claritin, sir.  I'm a little tick.  Claritin queer.  Yeah, or a claripound.  What do you usually haul when you're driving?  Just chocolate.  What do you haul besides Kleenex?  That was him blowing his nose.  Honk, honk.  Hey, it's flu season, man.  I didn't get a flu shot.  I'm sick.  I thought you were driving.  I am driving.  What are you hauling? 
[01:49:00]  He needs a haul.  Yeah.  I need a haul is what I fucking need.  Memphaliptus.  Did you guys tell the story about the dollar she tells at the end of one of her DVDs that  she entered a lookalike content and actually lost?  Oh, that's funny.  Oh, really?  That would be funny.  Did she?  That'd be a funny story to read.  I don't know.  Who beat her?  I don't know.  That's all I heard.  Somebody with afferent in their purse?  I brought you out, boy.  That's all I shit.  No shit.  Sound it.  Nothing funnier than listening to someone with a clogged nose. 
[01:49:30]  Man.  Oh, you want to know a little bit about her husband, Carl, who supposedly looks like a  mountain man with a big white beard?  Yeah.  Carl in North Carolina.  I'm a husband named Carl.  Yeah.  Her husband is named Carl.  I don't think they've ever seen him.  But I got a little short story to tell you.  I live off 95 in North Carolina, and her brother can't call Randy Pardin.  They got a big loan or grant through the state, and he came in and built a theater that  flopped, and they fired him, Randy.  The theater's sitting empty now. 
[01:50:00]  This is America.  I don't know what country he's calling for.  Holy fuck.  I love this accent, dude.  I hear a little New Orleans.  You spent time in New Orleans?  What?  No.  Or we just don't know our accent.  I'm right here on the border of Virginia and North Carolina.  I've been down 95.  Right here on the border.  You sound like New Orleans.  It almost sounds a little New Orleans, the way your accent is, sir.  Yeah.  Well, that's the story.  The city came up with all this money for him to open up a theater, and they ran him out 
[01:50:30]  of town.  Well, I don't blame him.  They gave him a bunch of money and didn't tell him how to spend it.  He built a state-of-the-art theater, and the city's went bankrupt for it.  They're still trying to pay for it.  All right.  I got you.  She came for the opening, and that was it.  Yeah.  That's all she did was come for the opening.  I got it.  I fucking love this fucking accent.  I only understood every other word.  That is a cool-ass accent.  Yeah.  The A-R.  The brother built a theater.  They didn't tell him how to spend it.  Brother built a theater.  What theater? 
[01:51:00]  What's the name of it, sir?  He's gone.  Fuck.  I wanted to talk to him all day.  It's a play of bloody bags.  Holy shit.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  That was funny.  Hey, Johnny.  Nothing's over.  It's over, Johnny.  All right.  We'll break, finally.  Oh.  We lost Patrice O'Neal a year ago today, man.  Fucking sucks.  You're kidding.  You know, I wanted to make an announcement, but...  We'll do it after the break? 
[01:51:30]  All right.  Oh, you want it now?  No.  You got it now, man.  I'll do it when we come back.  After the break, it takes people to come back to the show.  You got a bigger audience right now, Jimmy.  Okay.  So if it's important to you, you should do it right the fuck now.  Okay.  A couple of...  On sale today.  Caroline's.  I'm doing Caroline's again, April 11th through 14th.  Oh, I'm going.  Tickets are on sale.  Yeah, it's all new material.  Nice.  Tickets are on sale now or today at carolines.com.  And then Saturday, January 10th through 12th, I finally return to Nashville to Zaney's.  And, Jesus, January 24th, 25th, 26th, I'm in San Diego at the American Comedy Company. 
[01:52:00]  Ooh.  News to me.  News to me in San Diego.  We're going to be in Nashville.  Oh, can we fly to Nashville?  You should go to Dollywood.  Why don't we all go to Nashville?  Have some of Dr. Steve's moonshine.  I'm sure he's close enough.  Oh, I hope he comes to the day.  I've been to Nashville.  Has he seen you in Nashville?  I don't know.  I think it's kind of far from him, right?  Yeah, I think.  I went to Nashville.  Oh, with Jill.  Is it a good place?  It was a party in Little Town, I'll tell you that fucking much. 
[01:52:30]  You could get on some of those streets and just go bar to bar to bar right down the fucking  row.  Oh, Scott, I want to go to Nashville.  It's pretty fucking cool.  When are you going there again?  January 10th, 11th, and 12th.  No, I got to fly to L.A.  Fuck.  What day are you flying there?  Probably that Sunday.  Unless I go to Nashville, then I fly to L.A.  Yeah.  You could do that.  Let's work this out.  So, Patrice O'Neal, big special this weekend to honor our pal, and you got something to 
[01:53:00]  play in a break there, E-Rock?  Yeah, off Mr. P.  This one is titled, Black Women Get You Refunds.  I mean, black women are amazing.  I'm going to tell you what, if you need to get money back, a refund, you better get yourself  a black bitch, nigga, because she'll get a refund.  I went in AT&T with a phone I dropped in the toilet. 
[01:53:30]  And my bitch was back there.  I'm like, hold on, let me talk to this guy.  Hey, man, I dropped my phone in the toilet.  I just want a replacement phone.  And he's like, well, I can't do it.  I had to put a hood on her head, because she's back there like,  I'm like, look, man, all I want, I'm taking refurbish, nigga. 
[01:54:00]  Sir, we cannot give you any phone.  If you drop it in the toilet, we are not responsible.  You got one more motherfucking chance, man.  Sir, I'm sorry.  This bitch come back with five phones, and I don't have to pay the bill no more. 
[01:54:30]  This nigga is in the back, fetal-ed up, crying.  I told you, motherfucker, I wanted a refurbished replacement phone, asshole.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no. 
[01:55:00]  I've been saying, look, I'm a decent motherfucker.  Just because I want some side pussy, just because I want other pussy,  as opposed to yours, doesn't make me evil, people.  Dudes want side pussy.  You're never going to meet a girl whose hymen ain't broken, 
[01:55:30]  you know what I'm saying?  I said her pussy smells like mini-virgin.  Ooh, your girl looks better than me.  I got no self-esteem.  Your side pussy.  Damn, you got some nice titties.  Ooh, to put it simply, I'm cool with number three.  Your side pussy.  Don't be such a pussy, go get some side.  What women do have to understand is that we look.  That's a part of our soul.  We don't bleed every month.  We don't fucking sit down to pee.  We don't pop babies out.  The one thing that we suffer with is when we're committed, 
[01:56:00]  and women should understand what commitment is.  It's a commitment to us, not commitment to them.  It's a commitment that I can be not a piece of shit one day in my life,  that it doesn't solve the problem of strange twat everywhere.  One side pussy.  We don't have the tools to fight young, delicious women that say...  Patrice, I'm going to fuck you bad.  First of all, any bitch who doesn't want her asshole licked is an asshole. 
[01:56:30]  Side pussy.  Side pussy.  Side pussy.  Don't be such a pussy.  Go get some side.  Ooh, take it from me.  My ass is a guarantee.  Your side pussy.  You hear how delicious that sounded?  Ooh, I'll be your fucky.  I'm not too hard to believe.  Your side pussy.  Don't be such a pussy.  Go get some side.  That's how Harlem got hooked on heroin in the 20s. 
[01:57:00]  They give you the uncut dope, and then as soon as you go...  They go, God, you punk motherfuckers.  That's what they do, and it's not their fault.  It's not malicious.  It's just nature.  That's what they do.  They can't help it.  Nigga, what are you talking about?  Dude, want side pussy.  Ooh, we'll tell anyone that we get our fucks over twice a week.  Your side pussy.  Hey, can I lick your asshole?  Ooh, your girl looks better than me, but I'm more nasty. 
[01:57:30]  Ooh, your side pussy.  That's what I say to the milkman, nigga.  Ooh, I want to fuck you, Bad Patrice.  How you gonna say no to me?  Your side pussy.  Don't be such a pussy.  Go get some side.  Series XM.  The opening entry show.  Morning mashup. 
[01:58:00]  Just walked by the studio.  I gave him a nice, friendly hello.  Waved and smiled.  I like those guys.  I waved, too.  They're just wavable.  I like those guys.  I've always liked those guys.  He's trying to get the one direction.  They're all together.  Yeah, I think they're...  They go to the little lunchroom in a mob.  Yeah, they're armless and nice, and they've never done me wrong.  What do you think the show...  What do you think their show...  It's good.  It's hard, isn't it? 
[01:58:30]  I like them.  Killers.  Fucking motorheads.  Sounds like the crew. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, it does.  Doesn't the crew fucking took this sound right here?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  Why is Sam listening to old blues musicians?  What is that?  What are you doing over there?  I was listening to a White Stripes song, and I wanted to listen to the original.  Oh, God.  The original what?  Enough of the White Stripes song.  Of the White Stripes with you.  I know.  Stop it.  You're obsessed.  Seven Nation Army.  It's called Death Letter.  You're making fun of Seven Nation Army? 
[01:59:30]  I love that song.  It's a great song.  Look at this.  Look at this old blues guy.  This is a good...  A hearty, hearty, hearty, hearty.  Ant's a big fan of this shit.  Oh, my God.  It's good.  I like these guys.  Oh, stop it.  I do.  No, you don't.  I can't even play guitar.  It's terrible.  This fucking guy's terrible.  Oh, I'm glad they stole this music. 
[02:00:00]  That's a unique riff, though.  Sounds like his fingers are stuck in the strings.  Isn't that a unique riff?  No.  Yes, it is.  Oh.  Can you give me the riff of every blues song again, please?  I like that.  I hate it. 
[02:00:30]  You think they overuse that?  Fuck.  Too much.  Fucking.  That old codger couldn't fucking play or sing.  What are you talking about?  Everyone knows his name.  Oh, that's right.  It's hip to fucking like that.  The only reason you say you listen to that or like it is to sound like you're hip.  There's no auditory enjoyment that could come from that shit. 
[02:01:00]  I do.  I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan, but I do enjoy it.  I like Muddy Waters.  Yeah.  Dude, listen to them.  I don't like...  Could we listen to a little more of that?  Sure.  I don't like when people...  Sure, let's do this.  ...copy it.  I like the original guys.  I think there's something interesting about it.  Look at it.  He's got a nice haircut.  Let's hear it.  Let's hear it, too.  Dude, that sounds like someone that can't play an untuned guitar.  Hey, man.  Give him a break.  The white man broke every one of his fingers. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, all right.  You would listen to this in a car or fucking at home.  Maybe not this one in particular.  You're sitting outside by the pool, sipping a cocktail, going, this is wrong.  This is...  It's a slave song.  It's terrible.  I like this.  I do.  I do. 
[02:02:00]  You should El Caban him with that guitar.  Add it.  This is terrible.  Add it.  It's horrid.  There's nothing...  There's no redeeming value of this music right here.  Give me some Muddy Waters.  It's cunt hair.  How about some Muddy Waters?  What? 
[02:02:30]  That's the same shit as this.  It sounds very similar to that.  Oh, it all does.  It's the same stuff that got for white people.  You want to hear...  They stole this music and made it listenable.  Manish Boy's the one everyone knows, but you want to hear, like, maybe Champagne and  Reefer?  That could be fun.  Yeah.  That could be fun.  This is Champagne and Reefer.  That's an advertisement.  Am I the only one fucking saying it?  Yes.  Thank God.  Thank God what?  I used to smoke Reefer.  That white people stole this music.  Cheap.  And improved it.  I'm surprised people like Led Zeppelin and shit like that were able to find something 
[02:03:00]  in there that they could turn into something good.  This is Champagne and Reefer.  Roll it.  Oh, man.  Shit's a lot.  This is a little more than fine.  Muddy was the shit there.  Yeah, bring me Champagne when I'm first.  Yeah.  Bring me Champagne when I'm first.  Yeah, baby, want to where I'm going.  When I want to get high.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, bring me Champagne when I'm first.  Tired to the whipping post.  Oh, no, no, no.  Bring me Champagne when I want to get high.  One way out, baby.  Lord, I just can't go out the door.  One way out, baby.  You don't like this, though?  Hey, but one way out, baby.  Well, you know when I'm a lonely.  No, no.  Oh, Roger, Sister Lucille.  Bring me my woman, celebrate down here by my side. 
[02:04:00]  Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.  All right.  It's terrible.  I actually like that, too.  It's repetitive.  Guys, shit.  Peter has a problem with the show, and we take complaints very seriously.  Oh, boy.  What does that even mean?  Peter, what's going on?  What's the word, PD?  Go ahead, Mr. Pumper.  Yeah.  What's up?  Dude, it's this self-referential process, day in and day out. 
[02:04:30]  When you're not talking about yourselves or letting this guy, Sam, who shouldn't even be on a fucking race.  Fair enough.  I agree.  God, we agree there.  Okay.  Talk about...  Trust me in my livelihood.  Yeah.  Talk about what's going on in your tiny little world.  You have Opie reading the paper, basically just opening up the post and, like, you know, commenting on crap.  Welcome to a radio show.  That's called a radio show.  You talk about your life, and you talk about news and current events and pop culture. 
[02:05:00]  What do you think this is?  We did 20 minutes on Dolly Parton.  Who's going to give you that?  What do you think this is?  I've been listening to your show for a long, long time.  All right.  I feel like you've actually gotten...  And I feel like the quality of the content has only gone downhill.  All right.  That a boy.  That a boy, Peter.  What did we used to do that you enjoyed that we aren't doing now?  I feel like there used to be an agenda when you came in.  Wow.  An agenda?  Holy shit.  We faked it so well, I guess. 
[02:05:30]  Wow.  What do you mean?  Give us an example, please.  We're way more focused than we've ever been.  An agenda.  My God.  Actually, yesterday, you guys were playing some bits from back in the day.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  We played one thing from back in the day because we were talking about it,  and we wanted to hear it.  And you picked the wrong show because a lot of people would be in agreement  that yesterday was a stellar show.  Yeah.  So you probably should call us on a shitty day, 
[02:06:00]  and then maybe your point would be taken.  And, Peter, what was the problem with playing that, by the way?  I was actually responding to your question, Ann.  Okay.  I thought that was great because it illustrated a time.  Oh, my God.  And that's where I'm going to stop you because me and Ann actually had this  conversation before the show today that everyone is looking at OA photos  on Twitter going, wow, look at this stuff they used to do.  And I laughed at Anthony today.  I go, do you remember the days where we just went, hi, NAW, what do you got? 
[02:06:30]  Hi, NAW, what do you got?  Hi, NAW, what do you got?  There's no highlights or audio of that shit.  You're talking about 1,000 days of radio we did.  Right, right.  And you're looking at, like, fucking 10 days.  Oh, God, if you look at OA photos, if we did Teen Week every week,  then you would have a good argument here.  But the fact is, in between the stellar shows even back then,  there was a lot of shit.  Remember we used to replay things we did, like,  in the first two hours of the show and the second two hours  because we were out of stuff? 
[02:07:00]  I would love to replay stuff.  We just don't have time to replay it.  Remember we would play music?  Yeah.  Sometimes we'd just play a song because we had nothing.  And then 18 minutes of commercials?  Right.  Sir, I think your argument is, I, I, I, I,  You're looking at the show through rose-colored glasses.  There you go.  And I'm just answering your question about,  trying to give you an example about why it was better.  All right, hold on.  Joe in Tennessee wants in.  Joe, you're on with Peter.  Hey, Peter Pumpkin Eater.  You nailed him. 
[02:07:30]  You nailed him.  If you don't like the show, don't listen, dude.  Well, don't get rash.  Fucking idiot.  That's how I got.  I take a birthday.  All right.  Well, thanks.  Let me go to Alex in D.C.  I think Alex agrees with you, Peter.  Go ahead, Alex.  Hey, Peter, go fuck yourself.  I'm being a fucking crybaby, you motherfucker.  This is a fucking radio show.  This is what these guys fucking do.  I've been listening to them for fucking years.  If you don't like it, change the fucking dial. 
[02:08:00]  Go listen to fucking Oprah or some shit.  I think it's, I think it's time to really get rid of the crybabies.  Enough already.  Peter, there's plenty of guys that still enjoy the show.  Maybe the show has passed you by.  It happens.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, Peter, you want more bits.  That's what you're saying.  Actually, I love a little bit more of you.  Oh.  You know what?  This Peter, he makes a good point.  Yeah, Jesus.  Now Jim's in a quandary.  Yeah, what do you do? 
[02:08:30]  Well, you know what?  Peter has an opinion, and it should be heard.  What do you do now, Jimmy?  What do you do now, Jimmy?  I'm all about Team Peter.  Team Peter, you certainly are.  All right, Peter.  Thank you for whatever.  Thank you.  I'm not going to change shit.  Trust me.  More Jimmy, though.  Yeah.  Less Sam, more Jim.  I like that.  Ralphie Mae.  He's a lot spoken.  Hi, kids.  How are you?  It's Ralphie Mae.  What's up with the voice?  It's early.  It's got Steve-O voice.  Is this really Ralph?  Yeah, man.  I thought you were just a listener fucking around. 
[02:09:00]  Ralphie Mae is calling in.  No, it's on a hotline.  What's going on, Ralphie?  I'm up really early.  What's going on, guys?  Not much, Ralphie.  What's up with you?  Ralphie's very hurt.  I'm very hurt over here.  Why the fuck did this come out of nowhere?  Yeah, I was having a discussion with Patton Oswalt, and then I get a Ralphie Mae tweet about  how hurt you are and how I'm not a man. 
[02:09:30]  No, and, you know, one of my followers sent me a link to...  Are you on sleeping pills?  No, man.  This is how you sound when you first wake up.  It's L.A.  It's L.A.  It's 5.30 a.m.  5.30?  What time you set your alarm clock for this phone call?  5 o'clock?  I'm sorry.  I went to bed at 1 o'clock.  My three-year-old wet the bed, so I was up at 1 o'clock changing linens and putting a 
[02:10:00]  baby in the bathroom.  Do you foresee a problem?  Why do you wet the bed?  Did he see you rolling over?  Because he's three.  What happened?  He's three.  That's what three-year-olds do.  Yeah, they do.  Ask Jim.  There's a bit of a panic.  Ask Jim.  Hey, was that...  They'll lose their urine if they're panicking.  Were you in rehab or no?  You all right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was in rehab.  I didn't know.  Did you just get out?  Someone told us.  What, buddy?  Did you just get out? 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, I was in rehab.  I got out like 10 days ago.  Oh, wow.  Okay, cool, man.  Why were you in?  Jesus.  Kenny just told us it off the air.  I hope that wasn't private.  Why were you in rehab?  No, no, no, it wasn't private at all.  Why were you in there, brother?  My wife thought at first it was opiates, but it wasn't.  I was just going crazy.  I think I was going crazy from post-traumatic stress disorder.  I almost died last year, and I couldn't cover it up anymore. 
[02:11:00]  I couldn't cover up trauma anymore with food.  I had gastric bypass, and then I couldn't cover it up with marijuana anymore.  And I almost died again last year from double pneumonia.  I had bilateral double pneumonia and pulmonary embolisms.  And I couldn't smoke marijuana anymore.  This is the guy you're beating up, Pat.  I'm not beating anybody up, but no, I understand why he might be a little sensitive.  Well, no, no, I'm clear-headed now. 
[02:11:30]  I'm clear-headed.  I'm past all that stuff.  Why did you?  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  See, this is what Ann talks about.  Ralphie, listen.  It'll do you a lot of good if you listen a little bit.  That's all I'm saying.  Now, why did your wife think that it was the opiates?  Oh, she just didn't understand the big change in mood and everything that was going on with me.  She just thought it was drugs. 
[02:12:00]  It was the only reason I could be acting so different.  Were you just depressed, or were you, like, violent or something?  Yeah, I was depressed.  I didn't get violent at all.  No, I was just depressed, and just my mood had changed so much, and I was just a different person.  Jeez.  Jesus.  Sorry, didn't mean to be a bummer.  No. 
[02:12:30]  Jeez, Opie.  But how long were you in rehab?  30-something days.  Damn, that must have been tough, not seeing the kid for 30 days.  Well, you know, it's...  You get some visits, right?  And they got to come out every couple of days.  Yeah, so it was easier than most rehabs, and it was a really upscale.  It was probably one of the best rehabs in the world.  Yeah.  Because you are a disgusting fat-body private pile! 
[02:13:00]  That's one of the best movies I've ever thought.  Jesus.  Yeah, we've been featuring that movie today on our show.  It was one of the funniest things in the world.  I have fucking hilariousness.  Are you sober now?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What's your name, fat-body?  Anyways, I didn't drink.  I never was a big drinker, and for the last year and something, I didn't...  I hadn't smoked marijuana at all, and... 
[02:13:30]  Open your mouth!  And I only took the pain meds for, like, legitimate pain, and I never took...  What was the legitimate pain?  I'm sorry?  What was the legitimate pain?  I was in a big car wreck when I was a kid.  I broke 42 bones, 64 separate brakes.  And you're still suffering from that?  Yeah, yeah.  When you're over 400 pounds and you're on the road as much as I was, I mean...  Like, I haven't done a show...  I mean, I've done, like, four or five shows since October, but I was already over 311 shows. 
[02:14:00]  Wow.  Show per pound.  Yeah, yeah.  That's crazy.  Yeah, one per...  Jesus.  Yeah.  Yawn!  Yeah, no.  Ralphie, I got it.  I just want to get into this a little with you.  Can we break it down?  Like, how did this come about?  I didn't even know that.  Well, again, I'll explain it.  It was...  No, no, actually, I was doing a compound show, and of course, I like getting fucking completely  sauced, tanked, and going on live from the compound. 
[02:14:30]  That's, like, the gimmick is the show looks very professional and polished, green screen set,  and it looks great.  But I'm completely unprofessional and drunk doing it.  It makes it kind of fun and exciting.  Somebody asked me, where's Ralphie Mae been on the Opie and Anthony show?  And I answered, he hasn't been on in a while, and then I said, but there wasn't a reason  why you hadn't been on.  It just had happened that you hadn't been on. 
[02:15:00]  But then I brought up the fact that when you are on, it's very difficult to do the show  that, and I'm not even going to say we, because it's not Opie or Jimmy or anyone else, it's  just my take on it.  It's very difficult to have a conversation and do the show that I'm used to doing here,  because you do step on me.  And I've noticed other people, I don't know if it bothers them or anything, but it's hard  to have a dynamic conversation where there's pauses, because the second I would pause, you'd 
[02:15:30]  jump in on, and this is exactly how I did it on the show, by the way, that's, you know.  And you'd jump in, and it was very hard to do that, and it kind of got frustrating a little  bit.  So I brought that up.  I didn't say you weren't funny, I didn't say anything like that, but it was just the  way the show's dynamic changes when you come in.  That's all I said.  And you got a very, very, very sensitive. 
[02:16:00]  I just thought that, you know, if it was a problem, Anthony, that I, why didn't we just  talk about it during break, or something like that?  Well, because, like I said, I was doing a show, and it was asked of me at that time,  I didn't think, hey, let me refer to Ralphie before I answer this.  It's an, you know, it's an open forum of... 
[02:16:30]  We were on the actual...  Well, the problem is, I mean, we couldn't do it during break, because there was a lot  of finger-popping going on.  When are we going to do the finger-popping?  It's very hard to...  Oh, okay, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, just did the finger-popping.  It's very difficult during the show to address what's going on during the show.  You don't want to...  But what Ralphie's saying, and I think we're all in agreement, you just weren't a man about  it.  Look, you motherfucker. 
[02:17:00]  Ralphie said it, man.  Ralphie said it.  He said it on a man.  Knock it off, Fatty.  He would have been surprised, you know?  Oh, man.  Okay.  I can't even...  Opie's such a fucking instigator.  What happened?  A man cannot be a real man.  He said you weren't a man.  I know.  You could be a real man.  And E-Rock's got a theory why you haven't been on the show.  E-Rock, comment.  E-Rock?  Where's E-Rock?  E-Rock?  Oh, there it is.  What's your theory on why Ralphie Mae hasn't been on the show? 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, what was your thesis?  Yes.  Put this on me.  What?  Fuck you.  This is your thing.  It's not a thing.  It's what it was.  Say once again.  He could have used the term.  And the reason I didn't get into a discussion on Twitter with you about this the other day,  and you kind of, you know, I put, oh, Jesus Christ, and you got a little snippy about that,  was that I was in the middle of a conversation with Patton Oswalt and his fucking liberal-ass cunt fans.  That's a good way to put it.  So, you know. 
[02:18:00]  He is a little...  Open your mouth!  They're paying for it!  You eat it!  Jesus.  Yeah.  What were you saying, Ralphie?  He's a little...  Be more funny!  He's a little too off in that progressive world.  He's a little too MSNBC.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a little too much.  Man, the show's slowing down like your metabolism, man.  I'm sorry, baby.  Oh, Jesus.  Sorry, sorry, Keith.  Jesus Christ.  So, where are we at?  So, then, out of the blue, you decided to tweet Anthony that you were mad. 
[02:18:30]  Well, I mean, I just, I saw an opportunity to talk to him directly,  and as much as it was him specifically.  Yeah.  I thought, he's on right now, so I could just go, hey, boom.  Like, what was all this shit out of nowhere?  You know, I didn't know.  I thought we had a great relationship.  And then, and then I see this, you know, that I'm...  Call me, sir.  God damn it.  That's why I'm not on the show anymore.  Wait, what, you thought what relationship? 
[02:19:00]  I thought we had a great relationship.  And have a great relationship with somebody?  Yeah, that's...  Call the Daily News.  Come on, I'm trying.  Oh, E-Rock said Ralphie was lackluster?  Oh, Jesus.  E-Rock, did you see that?  What the fuck, man?  I mean, what was I given?  Shut your goddamn piehole!  What was I given?  The, uh, the fucking Toothpick Guy?  I mean, the...  You were here for Toothpick Guy? 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  That proves your lackluster.  You should have sat on that shit.  That's, uh...  That guy was a fucking creep, man.  We loved him.  You remember?  You were here for one of the better shows.  Oh.  You just mind your P's and Q's, Buster.  And remember who you're dealing with.  Was that the same guy, the Asian guy, uh, got a head full of mustard from us?  I don't think it was the same day.  You sure?  Because weren't we trying to squirt mustard at the Toothpick Guy and we hit the Asian kid?  Yes.  Oh, that is, yes.  The Asian kid with the mustard or something? 
[02:20:00]  He's in the elevator.  Yeah.  That was bad.  That was funny.  Holy shit.  I miss the days where we could open up the windows and do some shit on the sidewalk.  Oh, God, that was great.  Yeah.  I miss those days, too.  And then the other one was, uh, was, uh, uh, Burr, Burr went on a 45-minute, uh, all  the big banks are evil, uh, diatribe.  And then, now, welcome to the comedy of Ralphie Mae.  It's like, really?  Seriously?  Okay. 
[02:20:30]  I mean, 45 minutes?  Oh, boy.  And, uh, it was like, okay, what the fuck am I supposed to do with this, man?  Well, what's your excuse today?  Because Bill Burr's not here.  I got nothing.  I got nothing.  Today, I just stink.  All right.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, no, you don't stink.  You don't stink.  We're just, you know, hoping this.  You want me to pull something out of my ass on this one? 
[02:21:00]  No.  I got nothing, man.  No, but you didn't.  I don't know.  But, like, that's old, that's old shit, and then two days ago, like, it came out of nowhere.  Did it, like, a listener get a hold of you?  Well, I didn't know how old this thing was.  Or did it come up in therapy at the rehab?  I didn't know how drunk Anthony was, and I thought that he posted that stuff on YouTube,  and the heading was, fuck Ralphie Mae.  Oh, see, I didn't post it.  Somebody grabbed what I was saying on Life from the Compound, probably out of context.  I haven't even saw, I haven't even seen that clip. 
[02:21:30]  And then, of course, puts something like, fuck Ralphie Mae, and then gives it to you, you know.  Is that possible?  I guess if I was a man, though, I would have, you know, I would have told you to your face.  Hey, and then the other day I was like, you know, what's up with this stuff?  And you're like, oh, Jesus Christ, and then I get no response.  Well, that's when you called out Ann for not being a man.  I saw that.  Oh, Jesus.  But I was...  Does anybody remember last day? 
[02:22:00]  How much weight have you lost?  Oh, a lot, man.  A lot.  I'm going to this place next week in Nashville called FitRx.  What?  It's a fat camp.  What is it?  Fat camp.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  You're going to a fat camp?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  What is that all about?  Ralphie, what is it?  It's a mental fat camp.  It's mental, and you work out like four times a day. 
[02:22:30]  I mean, what is it with you?  Like, why do you think you've had a weight problem?  Have you gotten to the...  For years, I was burying trauma with food, trying to keep it all in the box.  Was it like something that happened in your youth?  Some people are just born with a different type of body, too, man.  Youth, tons of trauma as a kid.  Really?  Yeah.  Like real bad stuff?  Like, uh-oh, someone diddled you? 
[02:23:00]  Like, how bad?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  That and, you know, I was dying five or six times.  And what?  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  I was beaten by my brother a bunch.  I was put in the hospital like 16 times.  Jesus.  Do you still talk to him?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  No, I don't talk to him.  Why?  Because he's a dick.  I mean, comedians are cut from silk. 
[02:23:30]  I mean, our lives suck, you know?  So we're funny.  Why was he such a dick to you?  He's crazy, man.  I don't know, man.  Was it enough food for everyone else?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's fucked up, too, I guess.  I don't know.  Is he older, younger?  What is he doing for...  Older.  Older, seven years.  And what does he do?  Not much, man.  He's kind of fucking unemployed and employed and unemployed.  He lives in Arkansas.  He's a redneck.  Was he a big fella?  Yeah.  And mean, too.  And mean. 
[02:24:00]  Big and mean.  Damn.  Were you a cute little kid?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I was adorable.  Did you really get touched?  Was it a priest?  Yeah.  A neighbor.  A neighbor?  A neighbor touched you.  Fucking neighbors.  Yeah, I was a drug.  You were drugged?  Yes.  Jesus Christ.  This is the best Ralphie May appearance ever.  Right?  Right.  No, this is good shit.  Jesus.  What kind of...  I know.  It's more fuel for the pest.  How did he drug you?  In a soda pop. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, man.  But what kind of drugs?  I don't know.  Of course it was in a soda pop.  And then were you completely out or were you semi-conscious?  I wasn't pushing back.  Well, I just...  Oh, my God.  Whoa, did he do that?  Yeah, but I mean...  He tagged you in the ass?  I got a lot more trauma than just that.  Look, man.  Fuck, man.  As long as you don't push back, it's not good.  Guys are terrible.  At least you got that going for you.  Yeah, right.  Wait, he tagged you in the ass like I just said?  That's terrible. 
[02:25:00]  It was bad, man.  It was really bad.  How do you know if you were drugged?  Oh, my God.  Hospital visit.  What was it?  Hospital visit?  Yeah.  What happened to that guy?  He went to jail and was killed in general population.  Really?  How old were you?  Eight.  My God.  Now I'm just sad.  Our anus.  Our anus.  You are never to blame.  I licked my sweaty balls. 
[02:25:30]  Pass the magic dragon.  Stop talking and start sucking.  I suck, man.  That was terrible.  That's fucking...  Wow.  So he got...  How did you feel when you found out he was dead?  Great.  Yeah?  Great.  After a while, though, did it seem like,  oh, wow, it was great at the time,  but it really...  I'm not feeling much satisfaction even if he's dead? 
[02:26:00]  No.  No, it felt great.  Jesus.  It definitely felt great.  Definitely.  I'm gonna fuck you in the mouth.  I'm gonna fuck you in the mouth.  Oh, man.  I'm gonna fuck you in the mouth.  Penis.  Our anus.  Penis.  Our anus.  I licked my sweaty balls.  Oh, man.  That's pretty fucking tragic.  Yeah, man.  It was a pretty gnarly...  At least you could finally sleep without an eye open.  Yeah.  That must have been nice. 
[02:26:30]  But, you know, I mean, I survived two tornadoes, you know, it was...  You're a survivor.  Survivor.  Yeah.  Yeah, I am.  And I overcame it all.  What's your favorite surviving song?  I Will Survive, maybe?  We want to play one for you.  Or just a band survivor.  No, no, no.  I'm good.  I'm good.  So, how long between that episode of being abused, did you start, like, overeating? 
[02:27:00]  Oh, it was years.  It was years?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, it wasn't, you know, the next day and you just started, like...  No, no, no, no, man.  But you realized it was that that initially got you...  No, no, no, no.  It wasn't just that.  I mean, it was other things, too.  It was really after the accident.  Oh, really?  Yeah, after that.  Car wreck.  How did that happen, the car wreck?  Oh, drunk driver.  Drunk fucking driver.  You were drunk driving?  No, no, no.  I got hit by one. 
[02:27:30]  Jeez, man.  Wow.  And you were all fucked up.  Jesus.  I wasn't.  I wasn't.  Did your belly save you?  I'm sorry?  No.  Well, like an airbag.  What's wrong with you people?  He wasn't that.  Oh, you weren't big yet?  No, no, no, no.  Jesus.  That's fucking crazy.  Wait, so you...  Let's list all these things.  You survived the tagging in the ass.  Yeah.  Two hurricanes.  No, no.  Two tornadoes.  Two tornadoes.  1980, 1982.  How many...  How long was he abusing you for, by the way?  That must have been a miracle, considering you can't run. 
[02:28:00]  How the fuck did you survive tornadoes?  They hit our town.  I don't know.  Oh, come on.  Are you making believe you're a little closer than you really were?  Flexible, Arkansas.  Look it up.  Were you making...  But, I mean, were you close to the tornadoes?  No.  They decimated our town.  Damn.  Did you have to go in the basement?  We didn't have a basement.  The root cellar?  We...  I was in a...  Oh, everyone just held on to you?  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:28:30]  I was little, man.  I was eight and ten.  Oh.  Jesus.  Everyone grab a limb.  Oh, no.  How long was it...  Did he abuse you for, by the way?  It was two instances.  Jesus.  Oh, you like that, don't you, faggot?  You would think you would learn after the first.  You're drugged.  You're drugged.  You fell for the drugging twice?  Those men wanted to have sex with me! 
[02:29:00]  I didn't know what happened the first time.  Wow.  It wasn't a leave a mark the first time.  And you'd survived an older brother who was fat and mean, beating the shit out of you.  And you also survived...  He wasn't fat.  Oh.  You said big.  Oh, big.  I'm sorry.  And then you had the drunk driving accident.  What else?  Yeah.  Fuck.  That was pretty much my youth, yeah.  Damn, Ralph.  And I started doing stand-up the year after, and at 17, it was 1989. 
[02:29:30]  And Sam Kinnison told me to move to Houston, so I moved to Houston.  You knew Sam?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I didn't know there was this much tragedy.  That's what comedians are made of, man.  Fred Brooklyn on Twitter writes, great appearance by Ralphie Ned Betty.  Ned Beatty?  Sorry, man.  Jeez, man.  That's fucking...  Oh, eight.  Thanks for that.  I appreciate it.  That sucks. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, man.  I guess a lot of people were tagged in the ass growing up, so...  I don't know about that.  I'm glad I fucking was able to dodge that bullet.  Yeah.  Wow.  I was cute as a little kid.  So the rehab was good.  You've been out 10 days.  The rehab was great.  The rehab was great.  Awesome.  I feel so much better.  I'm so clear.  I'm happy.  I know it doesn't appear now, so...  You got a great wife. 
[02:30:30]  I do.  I got a great wife, great babies, and, you know, things are going through the roof, man.  Great babies!  Ah!  Really?  Come on.  I'm fucking with you.  You're saying he's not being a man again, right?  I know.  No.  I just got a dick on that one.  I'll go on that.  Come on, Robbie.  Just fucking with you.  All you comics got a little bit of a thin skin.  I get it.  When are you going to be in the New York area?  Um, probably, uh, late, uh, late February. 
[02:31:00]  Oh.  What?  Jesus.  Sam got it.  Sam.  Sam's just laughing his ass off in the corner.  You got it, right?  Okay.  Oh, boy.  Ralphie, are we, are we cool?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let's just, we're cool.  Well, hey, I didn't know that you were wasted.  I didn't know that you were wasted. 
[02:31:30]  I'm not using that as an excuse, by the way.  I'm not saying, like, I was wasted, so I said things that I didn't mean.  You would say the same shit, so.  I meant it at the time, when I said, like, it was, you know, it was kind of.  Then, then, let me be the first.  I'm sorry that I found you funny, that I laughed out loud.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Now you're in a situation.  Oh, now I don't know what to do.  Now you're in a situation.  You like when people think you're funny.  Oh, shit.  Not good.  Oh, shit.  You're breaking Anthony down.  You know that by saying that. 
[02:32:00]  Nah, all right.  I actually, I find you and, oh, really, really funny.  Thank you, sir.  And I find, you know, I'm actually a little intimidated when I come in there, because y'all  are, like, the fastest show I've ever been a part of.  Pew, pew, pew.  No, no, no need.  I kind of like this.  No need to be.  I kind of like the ass kissing.  No.  What?  No, it's true.  Better than being tagged in the ass.  I mean, your impressions are great.  Oh, thank you. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, it's really fast.  And then Jim is really fast.  And then y'all take a subject and y'all hit it from so many angles.  As a comic, there's really not much left for me to come in and do something.  So if I find an angle, the reason that I'm on a pause, I'm trying to get in there is that  I want to be part of the conversation.  And it's probably just an insecurity that I want to go in there and get it as fast as 
[02:33:00]  possible, because I want to be part of it and be thought of as funny, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What happened?  I hear you.  By the way, Jim Norton is here eating celery and peanut butter.  What?  He's looking good.  And he chose because he's a man to sit out this segment.  Oh, look at that.  Let the record show that Jim Norton has absolutely chosen.  I didn't even realize that.  Well, I want Ralphie to know that.  Yeah.  Well, he's lost a lot of weight. 
[02:33:30]  He looks great.  Thank you, Ralphie.  You got that one?  Yeah.  Well, you know, Ralphie says you're not a man.  I mean, you know, you were supposed to, like, take care of this in front of everybody on  Twitter.  Yeah.  No, I'm willing to...  Everybody on Twitter and everybody here?  I'm willing to go on Twitter and say that I'm totally cool with Ralphie and it's not even  an issue anymore.  Everything's fine.  And, Ralphie, what I said earlier was I've seen you stand up and you're amazing.  Oh, thank you so much. 
[02:34:00]  They can pull the tape.  I said you're really funny.  I've seen you many times.  Thank you so much.  Yeah.  I appreciate that.  I really do.  It means a lot.  All right, man.  And endorsements are very kind.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I mean it, too.  Everything's cool?  We're good?  We're good?  I think so.  I think so.  If you guys, if y'all ever do another show, I'd love to be a part of it.  And if y'all ever do a big Patrice show, I'd love to be a part of it.  I like that guy a lot. 
[02:34:30]  He was great.  It's a shame he's gone.  Certainly was.  Lost him a year ago today, sir.  Yeah.  I was thinking it was either today or tomorrow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a damn shame.  He was a beautiful man.  Yeah.  His friends know it was today.  Yeah.  What?  Ralphie, we love you.  Ralphie, we love you.  I love you guys.  And y'all get along with your merriment.  And sorry, Jim, if I'm cutting into your celery time.  No, not at all.  No, no, no, man.  I'm just happy to hear that you're doing okay.  By the way, Ralphie, celery is a vegetable. 
[02:35:00]  It grows out of the ground.  It's green.  We're on the same page there.  I know.  I went back to, I went to some AA meetings while I was in.  It tastes good without whipped cream.  You should try it.  I actually liked them a lot.  Yeah.  A lot of cool stories and stuff like that.  And I went to some AA meetings.  So much more interesting than AA meetings.  But they're so goddamn funny.  Really?  AA meetings and AA meetings.  Hilarious, man. 
[02:35:30]  Look where the party is.  I went to an Al-Anon meeting.  Fucking not fun at all, man.  Really?  Those fucking meetings are the most depressing shit of all time.  Those meetings suck.  But the AA meetings and AA meetings are hilarious.  Like, like, what, for drugs and stuff?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, man.  Yeah, the drug meetings are funnier than the...  Yeah, I did heroin for three days.  I was creepy.  I was watching Grinness Paltrow fucking jog.  And I was cooking up my shit and stuff like that. 
[02:36:00]  Well, we'll take your word for it that they were funny.  They were really good.  Really good stories.  But with the Al-Anon meetings, not so much.  But AA, I liked it, man.  It was cool.  Cool shit.  That's a joke, son.  Don't you get it?  I made a funny, son, and you're not laughing.  I've seen a horse fly.  Oh, shit.  All right, Ralphie.  You know we love you.  All right, guys. 
[02:36:30]  All right, man.  So we good?  Everyone's good?  Everything's fine now.  Everything's a good amount of time.  And it's a man now again?  I'm a man.  I'm a man.  I'm a man.  Spencer Davis Group, anyone?  Yeah.  All right, kids.  Take care, brother.  All right, man.  Take care, guys.  Bye, Ralphie.  Bye, y'all.  Take care, Ace.  There he goes, Ralphie, man.  Take care, Ace.  Back in our good graces.  There he goes.  And he did apologize to us, which he needed to do.  Holy shit.  That's fun.  I guess everything's cool.  That was fucking...  When are you going to be in New York? 
[02:37:00]  When are you going to be in New York?  And then...  Sorry.  No.  Are you going to be in New York soon?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, February.  And then this was...  Oh.  Oh.  That was so brutal.  And then you have the nerve to say, so are we good?  Yeah, yeah.  So we're good?  What happened?  You said horrible, horrible things.  I didn't know he was here for Toothpick Day.  I love Toothpick Day.  That was a good banner.  What happened to that guy?  Banner Day.  I don't know.  I was just looking at this video clip of him.  I do have regrets.  Yeah?  Yeah, man. 
[02:37:30]  I've had regrets over the years with this radio show.  I have sucrets.  And one of my biggest regrets was not fucking smashing the Toothpick art.  You tried your damnedest.  I didn't really.  I had my opportunity and there was something inside me that told me not to.  And I regret that now.  I'm sorry.  See, I have regrets.  They're good regrets, too.  Healthy regrets.  Healthy regrets?  Yeah.  If you Google Opie and Anthony Toothpick Guy, you can find a video of him taking calls on  his cell phone.  Oh, boy.  He keeps getting the wrong number because people keep asking for Ramon. 
[02:38:00]  And for Buttplug.  On his cell phone?  Yeah, because I think he posted his cell phone on his website and then he plugged his website  on the show.  Really?  So then all our listeners started calling him.  God, I missed that.  I can't see old videos from the other joint, man.  I miss that place.  Because we can just do stuff like that.  Yeah.  Why can't you see the old videos?  No, I mean, it's hard to see it because it frustrates me.  Yeah, yeah.  We had such a great setup over there. 
[02:38:30]  We had no fucking bosses breathing down our necks.  Just go down on the street.  They would just check in every once in a while.  We had the street.  We could open up the windows and feel New York.  Fuck with the people every once in a while.  Throw condiments at them.  I'd be happy with just a bigger studio.  Like, I like being in this building because I kind of like the energy as opposed to being  isolated and the weird.  Like, just yesterday.  Don't shut up.  You're right.  Fair enough.  I'm boring myself with any consolation.  But just calling out to guests like that.  Like, I kind of like the energy here.  Yeah, yeah.  But the studio does stink. 
[02:39:00]  And we should get a bigger studio.  And to this day, the Asian guy has no idea why he had mustard in his hair.  He has no idea.  No, I remember.  I'm a creep.  I'm a man.  Mustard in his hair.  You know what?  I didn't get it either.  Fuck, that was an easy one.  Should have got that one.  Mustard.  That's a good song.  What, is he going to fucking tweet me now from a homeless fucking tweeter board?  You don't like that song?  No.  His affected voice. 
[02:39:30]  He's in, um, he's doing all right.  Is he?  Yeah.  He's doing okay, yeah.  He's got a two-story box.  No, he's in like a hostel.  A shelter or something.  Shelter.  Oh, that's interesting.  All right.  What are we doing to break?  Are we playing a Survivor song for, uh, for Ralphie Mae?  Or are we playing some Patrice O'Neal? 
[02:40:00]  Survivor.  Oh, that's Dr. Steve.  Steve, call about the moonshine.  I want to know about your moonshine operation.  Ah, well, it's alcoholic fluid.  Yeah.  You take the mash, and you allow it to drip.  Mash?  You let it ferment for a couple of months with your socks in it.  You bring out a foreskin or two, get some smegma, and then you serve it to your friends.  I love what goes on during this show.  I'm just texting with my brother about some chick that we used to know that was so fucking hot that we saw on Facebook, and she's a complete fucking disaster. 
[02:40:30]  And now me and Joe are just tweeting, like, texting each other, like, what happened?  It was a fun little sub-conversation.  This chick was, and I'm talking back in, like, the fucking 80s, the epitome of pretty cute girl.  She almost had, like, a Pat Benatar kind of vibe and look to her. 
[02:41:00]  It might have been Pat Benatar.  Right?  Yeah.  No, no, because I've seen Pat Benatar these days.  Pat Benatar!  Exotic.  A boxonic.  And she was very cute.  Like, everyone fucking looked at her.  An ass, like, fucking great.  And now she's a horrid-looking old lady.  Can we see the picture?  If you guys have seen the picture, can we see the picture?  I would love to be able to show you a picture of then. 
[02:41:30]  If my brother is listening and he has a picture from back then, please send me.  It's not for everybody, but I want to see it.  There's no way you would ever think this chick was hot.  There's no fucking way.  That's her?  Yeah.  Who does she look like?  Let me see.  She looks like a horrible version of the stupid broad with the glasses.  Diane Keaton.  That had the hit.  Yeah, Diane Keaton.  But the hit.  Help me out.  Lisa Loeb? 
[02:42:00]  Yes!  Well, that's the glasses, I guess.  Like a real bad version of that.  Wait, did she retire from dam building?  Toothy zilch.  If you fucking even knew how hot she was back in what I call the day.  Yeah, it's frightening.  All right, good news.  Poor bitches.  Dr. Steve's going to get a secure landline.  He's going to tell us about his moonshine operation.  Also, the show's going to start getting really hot because we got audio from the attorney of the Elmo accuser reading excerpts from the accuser's book. 
[02:42:30]  Wait a minute, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but is today's Patrice's anniversary of his death or is it the 29th?  Oh, boy.  Oh, jeez.  His friends would know.  Look at this.  That's what you said.  I believe it was the 29th.  Well, today's the 28th.  I believe it was the 28th.  Do you know, Kenny?  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  For some reason, I think it was...  You might be right.  I just got a tweet that says...  It's tomorrow?  Yeah, but I don't know why that made me go, huh? 
[02:43:00]  Wiki says it's tomorrow.  Oh, Jesus.  It says 29th.  Awkward.  People are starting to chime in the 29th.  So, we're a day off.  Well, it seems like a year.  Today.  I wouldn't get all upset about it.  He wouldn't.  Who gives a shit?  That means Ralphie knew.  He was like, motherfucking...  No, but Ralphie knew it.  We didn't.  I thought today was the 29th.  That's what it's been saying on the sheet all week. 
[02:43:30]  I really thought today was the 29th.  We didn't say that Ralphie wasn't somebody that knew dates very well.  That wasn't one of the things that I had said about him.  That's how you prepare him.  How did...  Today's November 28th.  So, how did they get on the sheet all week that it was the 29th?  Today was the date.  The Wednesday.  Yeah.  How did that happen?  That should never happen.  Who did that?  I blame you.  You blame me?  I don't have anything to do with the prep sheets.  I bet Sal fucked this one up, too. 
[02:44:00]  Danny, comment?  Not really.  Oh, okay.  I'm just marching down.  Just that, uh...  It comes up as different...  Oh, sorry, buddy.  It's different dates.  Sorry, it comes up as different dates when you look at it.  Oh, really?  Is it the 29th that we announced it?  Oh.  Uh, no.  We...  I got the phone call from Matt Frost while I was here.  Travis, comment?  But it would have been the day before.  It was the day before we announced it because I didn't tell you guys until the show was over.  Right.  Because they asked me not to.  I got that date from Eric, and then I cross-referenced it with Google, which says November 28th. 
[02:44:30]  I didn't check more websites.  Wikipedia and IMDb listed as the 29th, but Google and other sources reported it.  28th.  Yeah.  Okay, so it's...  The New York Times has an article that was written the 29th.  One thing that I trust about Eric and I never question is his dates, because he's very good with this stuff.  How about you just Google all of our Twitters? 
[02:45:00]  If the article was written on the 29th, and Matt Frost is quoted in it, then he probably died on the 28th.  You might be...  How do we not know?  Let's just Google the Twitter, because everyone was on Twitter that day.  Can you go back and put someone's Twitter?  That'll take a little while.  Or just Google something that was said.  I think it was today.  Yeah, based on articles.  I think it was today.  Where's the old bit?  Jesus Christ.  The other 28th.  I wrote the obituary. 
[02:45:30]  Did you?  Yes.  Did you really?  Yeah.  Jeez.  Jeez Louise.  I don't know if it was...  Yeah, I think I did.  Yeah, I read it at the funeral.  Hmm.  And I don't remember.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  Then we got some crazy woman doing some crazy shit that's going to be pretty entertaining for everybody.  Have you seen the video clip of that Brazilian hidden camera show with the elevator?  Yeah, fuck yeah.  Hilarious.  Everybody's tweeting that shit. 
[02:46:00]  Fucking...  I saw it yesterday.  I don't want to watch it because it looks scary.  It is scary.  That kid's fucking scary.  But it's funny as fuck.  Like watching grown men get just the shit scared out of them in an elevator.  I just had one problem with that video.  What was that?  Well, obviously it's stationary.  An elevator's not going anywhere.  Yeah.  So how do you...  Everybody's been in an elevator and like thought they hit the button.  Yeah.  But then you realize you feel...  You could feel that you're not going anywhere.  Yeah, yeah.  And then you go, oh, and then you hit the button.  So how did all those people get in and go through all that and not realize that the elevator wasn't even moving? 
[02:46:30]  Well, maybe they assumed when the lights went out that the whole ride was fucked up.  But they go...  But they show the numbers.  Yeah, yeah.  Going up.  Well, maybe the numbers were fucked up.  And obviously there's one-way mirrors in that elevator and they're coming from behind and stuff.  But I've also seen one-way mirrors and they're not so great.  Well...  Do you think it's a setup?  I think it's a little setup.  You know what?  Some people, they can't act that well.  Like there were people that were genuinely scared shitless.  And like the last one with that guy where he like runs completely out of the whole elevator and... 
[02:47:00]  Like I don't buy it for a second.  You weren't buying that?  I don't know.  I bought it.  I bought it.  It looked fucking authentic.  People just shaking their hands like they were fucking scared.  The screen cap looks scary.  It's not scary.  The kid's funny as fuck screaming like that.  Ah!  Just screams into people's faces.  Don't spoil it for Travis.  He's going to get scared.  Yeah, Travis.  You're all scary.  Watch it.  I will watch it.  I just didn't feel it.  Do you ever wake up and like fucking Riley is standing there holding a dolly looking at you while creepy? 
[02:47:30]  No, but I've woken up and she's right in my face.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because it's time to wake up.  On the Patrice thing real quick, there's a daily news article from the 29th last year that said he died Monday night.  The 29th was a Tuesday.  Okay, good.  I think it is the 28th.  Okay, good.  The 28th.  I think we all just panicked.  29th is when all the news articles came out.  Slow down.  Slow down, everyone.  Yeah, it says November 28th, too, when you Google Patrice and Neil died.  One thing we have to remember is that Wikipedia is wrong so much that anyone can write anything. 
[02:48:00]  We're going to do a break and...  Break.  Break time.  Yeah, play some more Patrice for him, please.  Yeah.  This is Reparations off Mr. P.  But see, people talk reparation.  All right.  I could get killed for this, but I'm going to say it.  That ain't even funny, either.  It's definitely not going to be funny to white people. 
[02:48:30]  Or Latinos, or Asians, or Jews, anybody.  Here's what reparation should be.  Simple.  Because, look, we are all slaves right now.  We work so that we can pay a debt to the bank that the government got money from, that they're borrowing not on our behalf.  So we are paying someone else's debt.  So we are slaves to the government who is a slave to the bank. 
[02:49:00]  Okay?  I think black people, as reparations...  Don't get...  We can't get a pocket full of money.  It makes no sense.  Because niggas is just going to...  But here's what we do.  Because here's what black people are trying to do.  To create wealth. 
[02:49:30]  To become a wealthy people.  Even though they'll be poor, there'll be some that are super wealthy.  Like, Oprah has a lot of money, but she ain't wealthy.  Because it ain't from no tradition shit.  She's just lucky.  So that's why she hanging on to that shit.  Like, she used to support Obama outwardly.  But her...  She did that shit, and all those white women that love her...  Said, I don't like supporting this nigga so loudly, Oprah. 
[02:50:00]  So she quiet a little bit.  But here's the reparations.  I'm going to back up.  Since federal income tax is slavery, and we are all slaves,  and reparations is an apology for slavery, the original slavery that we're talking about,  black people should be exempt from federal income tax. 
[02:50:30]  I'm looking around, makes you a white boy.  He didn't like that shit.  He started biting his top lip.  Because if you understand money, you shoot me in the head just for even thinking that shit.  Because what that'll do, it'll cause wealth.  Here it'll do.  The people who are going to do what they were going to do with the $100,000 that we would all get are still going to do that. 
[02:51:00]  Oh shit, got more money.  More sneakers, nigga.  But the ones that understand money are going to take that shit and create wealth.  But it ain't going to happen.  But that's my reparation idea.  We all already have been slaves.  Federal income tax is slavery.  So I'm just saying, we're double slaves. 
[02:51:30]  They let us have enough to pay for our fucking plantation hut that we live in that they always threatening to take.  We're going to take your shit.  Wise, I work so hard.  Wise, they go do this.  That's everybody.  White people too.  Wise.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:52:00]  Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel.  Sirius XM.  It is what women do and men do.  If this was a company, we start out in the mail room.  You start out as a fucking get the coffee.  We have to start out by what have you accomplished thus far in your fucking life.  So we have to come in and your company as get the coffee.

[02:54:00]  This is the OP Anthony Show.  So, Ant got a tweet. 
[02:54:30]  I think I got the same one.  Some guy goes, if that wasn't a bit, you guys are assholes.  Yeah.  Which is...  And it amazes me.  The dumbest tweet ever.  I hate tearing down the walls of this show, even though we joke about it, but I feel like  I have to.  Like, Ralphie May called in, and we...  Yeah.  It was pretty good radio.  And I think we also, like, are cool now, in a weird way.  Yeah, but we were, you know...  But people go, if that's not a bit, you guys are assholes.  But, like, I was talking at it during the break, I'm like, I would never have a conversation 
[02:55:00]  like that with Ralphie May if I wasn't on the radio.  Do people understand that shit at all?  Like, I have a sound machine at home, and I would call Ralphie and just start playing  sounds.  Like, it's on the radio.  Figure it out.  And I hate to tell the people that.  I just assume the ones that might have some type of intelligence understand a little bit.  Why the fuck would I have that conversation if he called my house?  Those stupid people are dummies. 
[02:55:30]  And that's why we're not assholes.  Dummies.  It's completely different.  It's tomorrow, by the way.  It is?  Okay.  Patrice O'Neill left us a year ago tomorrow.  Yeah.  I just texted Vaughn.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I knew the whole time it was tomorrow.  Go back over the tape, I covered all fucking pieces.  Right.  I didn't remember what day, honestly.  I thought it was earlier in November. 
[02:56:00]  I had no memory of what day it was.  I was able to work it out where I was going to be right no matter what.  You can find tape of me being right now.  All right, we'll do this whole thing again tomorrow, then.  Fuck it.  And then we got the big Patrice O'Neill special this weekend.  Yes.  And then one asshole has to write,  Is it going to be four hours that you just play over and over again all weekend long?  Holy shit. 
[02:56:30]  And I tell you, with these dumb haters, that's exactly what I see in my head.  Imagine years ago when you just had to deal with a request line phone caller.  Right.  That was pretty much your only interaction you had with fucking quote-unquote fans.  Right.  Now everything you do.  With that said, it's going to be four hours and 30 minutes of quality Patrice O'Neill stuff  that we'll play over and over again. 
[02:57:00]  I think it's what, 20 hours or something?  21 hours.  21 hours.  All right.  All right.  Is that all right?  I'm only 21 hours after all the years he gave you.  21 hours after all the years he gave you an OZ.  Watch, you'll get one of those.  I guess he wasn't that big of a friend of yours.  You're forgetting I heard this already.  Yeah.  You did?  No way.  No, no, no, no. 
[02:57:30]  Not you guys doing it.  No, no, no, no.  What they'll say is, I've heard this already.  Why are you playing it?  Oh, yeah.  You'll get that too, of course.  Yeah.  All right.  Um, so we got the Elmo accuser, number three.  Oh.  And I guess he already wrote a book about it?  Well, he wrote a book a few years ago, and he doesn't directly name the voice of Elmo.  He has him under an alias.  Oh, okay.  And his lawyer is now saying that this book was written about him years ago, and that  my client wants to come out now in support of the other victims. 
[02:58:00]  Come out.  Okay, and he just happened to have a book.  And he happened to have written a book.  Oh, there you go.  Has it been released yet?  The book was never published, but it says there's a copyright on it from 2009 or something  like that.  So maybe he should just rewrite it and put in Elmo's name.  Yeah, now he's going to put the guy's name in.  Elmo.  Mr. Elmo.  Elmo.  Not even the guy's name.  It's Elmo.  Kevin Clash.  And then, uh, yeah, and then he'll sell a lot of copies, huh?  Just peck a clash with that guy's butt.  Oh, Chip.  Shut up.  You shut up.  Fucking cop.  Elmo says these bitches lie. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, yeah.  All right.  So the lawyer is reading from the book, and this is where it's kind of fun for everybody.  Meant to boost it a little bit.  Yeah, I see that.  My client, in 2009, began to write a book about his experiences.  And he has a chapter entitled Tickled My Heart.  I'm going to read you an excerpt from this book.  It was not published.  Like Tickle the Elmo.  When we first met, I was 16, and there was no intercourse. 
[02:59:00]  However, lots of heavy kissing, and he showed me what it felt like to get on your knees and  obey your man.  Right, and I fell apart.  I did not fall for this new guy.  Granted, he was now 43.  He was a very successful businessman, so he claimed.  But later, I learned that he was actually in the world of entertainment.  Mr. Tickler is what I will call him.  And the game we played was father and son.  So the night I visited Mr. Tickler, in his gorgeous condo on the Upper West Side, I knew  this man had pretty coin.  When I arrived inside, he greeted me with a pleasant smile and a bear hug. 
[02:59:30]  Mr. Tickler definitely lied about his age.  However, he was still attractive.  We sat down and talked for hours.  He really seemed to be into me, and I was definitely into him.  I noticed that he had an Emmy on his shelf, and I thought it could not be real, because  I knew every black man who had an Emmy, so I thought.  I just really scoped his place out and acted very calm.  On our first night, I did not lose my virginity.  However, I learned that it's all life.  It's your asshole. 
[03:00:00]  Shut up.  And take your brother with it.  Losing virginity every time you take a shit.  He took his finger and placed it inside my ass and told me how tight I was.  I whispered to him.  I have never been...  What was that part?  Go back.  This is getting hot.  Yeah, it was getting all sexy.  This isn't the part about the kissing and taking my breath away.  And I'll put a finger in your asshole.  Get it out of here.  Listen to this.  It's getting all sexy.  What it felt like to kiss a man and take your breath away.  He took his finger and placed it inside my ass and told me how tight I was. 
[03:00:30]  I whispered to him.  I have never been touched there before.  I could tell by the slight smile on his face that he wanted to be my first.  He's working like a puppet.  He will take this thing slow.  Just let me taste you if you request it.  I didn't want to disappoint.  So I allowed Mr. Kigler to taste my growing manhood.  And I decided to return the face.  My growing manhood.  Growing manhood.  Wow.  They sucked each other's peckers.  That's right, Chipper. 
[03:01:00]  The guy put a finger in his butt and they sucked each other's peckers.  Oh, got it.  You think he took the finger he had in his ass and pulled it out and then grabbed his cock and started blowing him so he had that finger right under his nose so he could smell his asshole while he sucked his cock?  Like, gay sex is hilarious.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  He put a finger in his butt and they were sucking each other's peckers.  That's right, Chipper.  Way to be analytical. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, man.  Mr. Tickle.  Mr. fucking Tickle.  Mr. Tickler.  Takes your breath away.  Then I sat on his Emmy.  And I wished it was an Oscar.  It made me want to fuck Tom Hanks because he has two.  Two of them side by side.  A little DP.  Uh, that's, uh, something.  Wow.  Oh, there you go.  Well, obviously, he was having sex with a fucking underage, uh, boy. 
[03:02:00]  Underage boy.  I don't think a 16-year-old guy.  I agree.  That's nothing.  That's not a kid.  That shouldn't be any fucking law right there.  That's not a kid.  It's a fucking guy who wants to fucking have sex.  At 16?  Holy shit.  A 16-year-old guy is a little different than a 16-year-old girl.  This guy's not a pedophile.  At all.  I think it's not a pedophile.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Especially considering what they did.  You got the little boys.  They go up on stage and kiss the pop stars, and that's cool. 
[03:02:30]  But if it's an older guy, and then a little girl comes up and kisses the guy, then there's  outrage.  Especially if there's a finger in her ass.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, that's a given.  Yeah, imagine that if it was this guy and a fucking chick.  It's like, oh, he stuck his finger up my ass.  You're like, holy shit.  But then the next part would have been different, because what they did was different.  Well, yeah.  Well, yeah.  Couldn't fucking...  They sucked each other's peckers.  Right.  I heard you. 
[03:03:00]  Couldn't put, yeah, the growing manhood, growing womanhood in your mouth.  Put the clit hood in your mouth.  This is still a hood.  I understood it.  I know, Jimmy.  Fucking toot that horn, Chipper.  Yeah.  They were tooting each other's horns.  That's one way to put it.  That's another way to put it, actually.  Yeah.  And he had his finger in there like it was a tuba.  Playing a tuba. 
[03:03:30]  Hey, Chipper, don't let nobody play your tuba, my mother would say.  Are there any...  Delightful.  Yeah.  Have there been any recent Elmo sightings?  No?  They haven't replaced him?  They haven't...  What are the plans for Elmo?  They said that he's filmed a bunch of episodes that they're leaving, and his voice...  He was in the Macy's Parade.  Yeah, but it wasn't the same guy doing the voice.  It might have been.  I think it was pre-recorded, but I think it was his voice.  Singing.  Really?  I think so. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, wow.  I guess Sesame Street's all about this.  Elmo was dancing with the kids.  Thanksgiving.  Of course he was.  With the fucking stink finger inside of him.  He's working that puppet with a stink finger.  You think Don McClain's waking up right now?  A long, long time ago.  You think his hair has its own pillow before he swoops it over in the morning?  It must sound like he's laying on shredded wheat when he puts his head down on a pillow.  Just crunching that fucking dry-ass comb-over. 
[03:04:30]  It's like uncooked spaghetti he's laying on.  Just crunchy?  Yes, very crunchy hair.  What the fuck would he do that for?  How about some conditioner?  I don't know.  Hey, we got...  I don't even know how to explain this one.  See, we have an agenda.  Good.  Sam handed in this audio, but he doesn't really want to explain it.  Well, I don't want to tell you what she says, because it's weird. 
[03:05:00]  All right, so you got a crazy woman on the news in Portland?  Yes, it's a raw tape.  This wasn't actually on television.  But this is the, like, man-on-the-street raw tape from a Portland news TV show.  So, yeah, all right.  All right.  Well, the police wouldn't let me go through 120 seconds, so I had to go around 119th and go...  And I was...  They let me look at the lawyer's building.  I know the vacuum cleaner man. 
[03:05:30]  He's seen my tits.  I know that's not going on TV, but it's true.  It's true.  I'm not here to lie to you.  I was trying to get a hold of him.  Wait, wait, what?  This broad?  Yes.  Oh, Jesus.  She's an old fucking broad.  She looks like...  John Denver.  Yeah.  And the other...  What's wrong?  Paul Williams.  Paul Williams.  Oh, yeah.  Paul Williams.  Paul Williams. 
[03:06:00]  Just an old-fashioned love song.  Playing on the radio more.  Look at this broad.  Put this on the Facebook page.  Yeah.  Most of the clips we play, we try to throw them on the Facebook page.  Coming down in three-part harmony.  Just an old-fashioned love song.  One I'm sure they wrote for you and me.  You got the second part over there?  Yeah.  I'll hear it talk about theoretical physics.  What is...  Did you see the damage to the building then? 
[03:06:30]  All the bricks?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  He must have been greatly hurt.  He must have been badly hurt, injured.  How fast do you think he's going?  I haven't been allowed to drive for three years, so I am not a good judge of that.  Anything else you wanted to add about what you saw?  You want to see my tits?  Louis?  Why is she saying that, by the way? 
[03:07:00]  I think she's just crazy.  I don't know.  And if she likes showing her tits?  I guess so.  You think that's her thing?  Well, she can't drive, so I'm assuming maybe she's medicated.  Yeah, maybe she bounces on her tits to get from place location A to location B.  That's not what I was assuming.  I'd say, yeah.  I'd say we're on the same wavelength.  All right.  She showed the vacuum man her tits.  But what was the story about?  I think it was just about damage relating to maybe there.  No, it was Portland.  I don't know.  Just some damage of a building. 
[03:07:30]  How fast he was going.  So what?  Did a car crash into a building?  Must have.  But the real story there is that she knows the vacuum guy.  He's seen her tits.  Nice.  Yeah, of course.  Which I didn't even know there were vacuum guys, but I know.  They suck.  Ah, Chipper.  Very good, Chipper.  Come on.  We're going to see The Hobbit soon, huh?  We're going to see it in a few days.  There's a controversy behind this movie, by the way.  Why?  Because it's going to be delivered at a higher frame rate in some movie theaters, which gives 
[03:08:00]  it that look that can only be described as a soap opera look.  Looks like high quality, high definition video instead of that film look of 24 frames per  second.  I think it's 48.  They double the rate.  Or 72 frames per second.  Holy shit.  That's crazy.  Um, so it's going to look like, when you get a new TV these days, the settings usually  are set to that.  And you watch a movie, and it doesn't look like a film. 
[03:08:30]  It looks like a homemade video.  Right.  I don't like it at all.  I turn the rate down.  Yes.  Yeah, I turn the rate down, the hertz rate down.  Oh, you could do that?  Yeah, you could.  There's a setting in there to knock it down to make it look.  It's great for sports, but regular shows, it feels like it's just a camp court.  Sports, it looks great, like live television, that video look, like that soap opera-y look.  That's just new TVs?  Yeah, yeah, new TVs, you can do that.  But they're doing it now in a movie, in a movie theater, you're going to see The Hobbit 
[03:09:00]  like that, and it's going to look like that fake-y soap opera-y look for a movie.  How do you know, though?  You got to think the movie people are like, to them, it must look great, or they wouldn't  take that chance.  They're saying it's clearer, it's crisper, you can see more, because movies are known  for that gritty, cinematic, grainy, film-grain look, and this is very HD, very crisp and  clear, but that, I think, takes away from that film look. 
[03:09:30]  You want it to look like a film.  With 3D, though, who knows?  With 3D, it might help it, though.  3D, it probably will help it, but I don't like the idea of a movie looking like that.  I'm going to check it out, anyway.  We're seeing it on a screen that's, I think, ready for that or something.  We're seeing it in that ratio.  Yeah, you got 72 frames per second?  Yeah, I think the screen's 24 inches by...  Oh, that's a big screen.  Oh, that makes it harder to see, I believe.  62 frames per second per second.  You know, I learned something about Faith Healers by listening to Penn Jillette's podcast. 
[03:10:00]  What'd you learn?  He interviewed the amazing Randy.  Do you know how those fuckers do it?  You know the wheelchair people?  Do you know anything about this?  You know a little bit about everything, Ant.  I try.  What is it about this?  You know when they get the wheelchair people up and they heal them and they walk?  Yeah.  They didn't go to the event in wheelchairs.  But how they get away with it, they kind of interview people ahead of time and say,  hey, if you're ill or sick or whatever, we're trying to find people that we could heal today. 
[03:10:30]  And then they casually go, well, we're going to put you in a wheelchair so the guy on stage  knows who to fucking pick.  That's all it is.  That's hilarious.  But these people want to believe, so they're not going to say, look, I don't need a wheelchair.  Right.  So they're doing the mumbo jumbo and they go, you're healed, stand, walk across the stage.  Oh, and meanwhile, they're healed for a headache.  Or whatever.  Or whatever.  But they're thinking they're healed, yeah, what is really bothering them. 
[03:11:00]  And get up and walk and now everybody watching thinks that they're being healed from a wheelchair.  Yeah, but their illness has nothing to do with them not being able to walk.  What a great gimmick.  But they blow that shit off because they completely believe whatever the faith healer did.  They're healed.  So they go back to the crowd and go, well, you healed me.  Healed me.  The Amazing Randy, because, you know, and he's 83, 84, and he sounds great on the podcast.  If you can find that clip for tomorrow, it would be worth playing because it's a little more 
[03:11:30]  than what I'm telling you today.  But, you know, Amazing Randy would do his investigating, and he watched some of these faith healers.  They pull, they back up a truck, and they bring the wheelchairs out of the truck.  That's great.  For the event.  And they're all old and shit because you don't want brand new wheelchairs because then someone  might be on to you.  Yeah.  And then they fucking go, all right, we're going to put all, you know, you, you, and you  in the wheelchair so they can pick you.  That's, you know, just so we can point you out from the, you know, from the stage.  Should have known that was wheelchair Fred. 
[03:12:00]  And that's all it is.  Yeah.  And no one, and if you go to that event, you, you, you want to believe, most of them  believe.  I believe.  So you're not going to be the one going, wait a minute, I, is this about walking?  Cause I could already walk.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't believe.  Oh, you got that clip.  I mean, I, I got the whole podcast.  No.  Get the clip for tomorrow.  Is it eclipse?  Yeah, we got it.  The boss said.  No, that's when the song passes.  I mean, you know, maybe get it for tomorrow.  Yeah.  But I was like, holy fuck, it's that easy. 
[03:12:30]  Get the gist.  Really, really good podcast though, man.  Cause you know, the amazing, the amazing Randy's been around forever.  Talks about side shows and all these, all these acts you'd never really heard about and  what they used to do and stuff.  Really, really good old school stuff.  Yeah.  Really good.  Oh, oh school.  Uh, Dr.  Steve is a text to me and he's on the hotline.  That was him.  Dr.  Steve, you just texted me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I wanted to get in on that conversation.  Oh, you did?  The, um, Google or a YouTube, James Randy debunks Peter Popoff. 
[03:13:00]  It's P-O-P-O-F.  Is that the one we did already?  No.  Did you do that one already?  No.  I don't know.  I'm asking.  Okay.  I haven't heard you guys do that, but it was brilliant.  What happened was this guy was a...  Then it must have been us.  He was a faith healer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It must have been.  Okay.  And he used, uh, he had his wife in the back, uh, who was using a wireless at the time,  which was for, you know, a technology.  And, uh, she would, uh, send this guy messages through this earpiece and tell him stuff about 
[03:13:30]  the people in the audience.  And he would go, Oh, you have uterine cancer.  Well, they put a guy in a costume dressed up as a woman in the audience and told them  that he had uterine cancer and Peter Popov calls this guy up because his wife is saying,  yeah, that woman up there has, uh, uterine cancer.  And, uh, they, they videotaped that and, uh, the amazing Randy was outside and recorded 
[03:14:00]  the audio of his wife talking to him because, you know, over the radio.  So, and then he went on Carson that night and, and played the audio a lot of Peter Popov.  It's amazing.  Can we see some of that, Sam?  Yeah, Sam's trying to find.  And they got this guy going, Oh, you're cured of, of uterine cancer.  And this dude in this dress is going, Oh, he's all happy.  He's been cured of uterine cancer.  I seen that Peter Popov guy on the late night commercials and stuff.  And he's selling that magic fucking water, that holy water. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, I, I saw him.  You know what else I learned from the podcast?  Amazing Randy said that Steve Jobs, uh, had a, had a 50 to 60, a 60% chance of, uh, surviving,  but he went with the mumbo jumbo shit.  A smart guy like that.  And the amazing Randy saying, look, I'm not saying that he'd still be around, but he really  fucked up his odds because he believed in some of this, this shit that faith healing.  Yeah.  The faith healing and all that, that amazing Randy absolutely believes is, is, is not, 
[03:15:00]  not, not real.  It doesn't matter how smart you are.  Scientists have been fooled by Uri Geller and Uri Geller is nothing but a magician.  Yeah.  Be careful.  You know, now we've taught, well, look.  Pendulet says these guys could sue you and they love suing.  Uri Geller's an asshole.  You can say that.  Yeah.  You can say he's a shit bag.  A douche.  All that stuff.  Well.  Peck a sucker.  Uh, then I challenge him to take up amazing Randy on his million dollar thing and show 
[03:15:30]  that he has psychic powers and he's a magician.  Wow.  I want to see the Peter Pop.  What is it?  Peter.  There's a few different ones.  I'm just not sure if they're the ones Dr.  Steve's talking about.  Ah.  There's an inside edition.  There's, there's one that's like a documentary.  No, I just want to make sure it's the right one.  I don't know.  There's one at the top of mine that says, and I'm pretty sure it says Peter Pop.  It says, James Randy debunks Peter Pop.  And then just put in Johnny Carson at the same time.  Johnny Carson. 
[03:16:00]  But, uh, you know, Pendulet does a pretty good podcast.  That Sunday school's great.  And, uh, him interviewing the amazing Randy was, it was a great listen.  I would love for you guys to get a, uh, a medium in there.  And then let us, let me get some, uh, magician that's good at cold reading.  We want to get a medium in there too, but so far we just have a double XL.  He's giving you the finger.  Poor E-Rock.  I want one named Raya. 
[03:16:30]  So after it's done, I could say, well done, medium Raya.  See, that's why you're not a man.  I hear you said Ralphie Mae was right.  You're not a man.  We'll go with Ralphie.  Is Ralphie coming in?  Um, so Dr. Steve.  Yeah.  We're going to try to find that.  Do you have it?  I have James Randy debunks.  How about we organize all this for tomorrow?  Yeah.  You get the clip from the, uh, the podcast about what I was talking about.  And then you get this clip and we can have a little fun with the amazing Randy tomorrow. 
[03:17:00]  That's going to involve show prep.  I can't promise.  Oh shit.  That's going to involve having an agenda.  Having some kind of planning.  Like the caller said.  Remember Peter earlier?  Yeah.  In the program.  Here's the problem.  Oh, Jimmy.  The caller wants an agenda, but he wants to know Sam.  So if I'm the one accomplishing the agenda, that's only half happy.  It's a catch 22.  That's right.  When are you going to make the listeners happy and leave?  Oh, Jesus.  As soon as there's any other option.  I mean, literally at a moment's notice. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, I can't forget to get my Powerball.  I'm going to fucking forget.  About what?  I should set an alarm on my iPhone.  Watch this.  Mm-hmm.  Ahem.  Ahem.  Ahem.  Ahem.  Today, um, Caroline's tickets are going on sale for me for April 11th through 14th.  And, um, go ahead.  Oh, no.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Ahem.  I'll be at Buffalo.  Set an alarm for 1 p.m. 
[03:18:00]  I will be on, uh.  You're going to listen to us all day.  Buffalo, uh.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Sorry.  At the Helium Comedy Club, uh, December 28th through 31st.  Ugh.  January 10th through 12th is Nashville.  Go ahead, buddy.  I'm sorry.  It says, I don't know what that means.  I could search the web for Lockhopper I am.  All right.  Well, why don't you do that, then?  How about something lover?  Siri.  Set an alarm for 1 p.m.  January 24th through 26th.  I'll be in San Diego.

Siri, set alarm for 1 p.m. for Powerball.  E-Rock.  Friends of the show, can we do the Pendulet thing?  1 p.m.  Alarm is on. 
[03:19:00]  There's no friends of the show this week.  Yay.  So, for the next one.  For the next one.  Can we grab the Pendulet Amazing Randy thing?  Yeah, I got to, yeah.  You'd have to have expressed written consent.  Yeah, I got to get his permission to do it.  Why?  It's English, dude.  Won't let us air anything unless they have a release.  Why?  Who?  The company.  Just fucking run it.  We won't let us.  Until there's a problem.  Won't let us.  There will be a problem.  Lots of the days where you used to just do shit until there was a problem.  I remember.  Those days are long gone, my friend.  Those were the days, my friend. 
[03:19:30]  We thought they'd never end.  I know that one.  Yeah.  Dr. Steve, we were going to talk about Moonshine, but we have run out of time for today.  That's okay, man.  We'll do it another day.  How about tomorrow?  Sure.  See, we have an agenda tomorrow.  Oh, my God.  Moonshine talk and Amazing Randy clips.  Go deliver your palliative care.  Okay.  And, of course, Dr. Steve does a terrific podcast as well.  Weird Medicine is a very good podcast. 
[03:20:00]  Thank you.  I do like it.  Yeah, if you could get past the prank callers.  9 p.m. Saturdays.  His show is called Weird Medicine.  Yeah!  Weird Medicine with Dr. Steve.  Whoa!  Tune in to Weird Medicine.  Weird Medicine is what we need.  Right?  Right.  You should do that.  Isolate that, please, Sam.  You got it, buddy.  You have a new theme song.  And isolate this.  Die!  Oh, Dr. Steve. 
[03:20:30]  Thank you, sir.  Aw, you hung up on him.  Man.  All right, so we'll do some Amazing Randy tomorrow.  Holy shit, I can't believe you've got two things planned for tomorrow.  Yeah.  You want to talk about the show's better, the show's worse?  Peter got to you.  Peter got to open.  Yeah, he did.  Now he wants to plan things for the show.  He sure did.  I'm a sensitive baby.  Oh, man.  I'm a sensitive baby.  See, I told you.  He finally admitted it.  Oh, you listeners give us hours of joy. 
[03:21:00]  And agita.  And a little agita.  But mostly joy.  You have no idea.  Yeah.  He really, that guy really called up and said, all you guys do is talk about yourselves  or news stories.  And news stories.  A lot of people that are in the room with you.  It's a radio show.  What are you talking about?  We started off a little slow today.  Did we?  Yeah, a little bit.  But we did great.  But, you know, we hit it out of the park in the end.  And, yeah, sometimes we just open up the paper just kind of trying to stimulate something.  Yeah.  Yeah, we do do that.  Nah.  Nah. 
[03:21:30]  Sometimes we fall flat on our asses.  That happens.  But when everything's overly organized, you get a show like the morning mashup.  Um, not that there's anything wrong with that.  Right.  But, I mean, the mashup is that type of show.  They're terrific.  We are this type of show.  Mm-hmm.  Did you see me get fucking nailed yesterday?  What happened?  By bladder.  Dude.  What did you do?  It was fucking terrible.  I saw him coming down the hallway. 
[03:22:00]  So, I ran out the door and literally did, like, the fast walk down the hallway.  The second I was ready to hang that turn and disappear from view, I hear,  Anthony!  And bladder, like, I went, don't!  And I turn around and he goes, what do I look like, a fucking idiot?  He, like, was pissed.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He gets pissed.  I was trying to sneak out after doing a show till 10.30.  Are they firing me?  What?  Are they firing me?  I don't think so.  He was mad at me. 
[03:22:30]  Because we were supposed to have a meeting yesterday.  But since we went to 10.30, that was called off.  Now it's Thursday we got our meeting.  But he saw me fucking bolting.  What's the meeting about?  And he wanted to know if I thought he was a fucking asshole or a fucking...  I didn't answer that question.  Did you immediately have flashbacks and start crying and saying your stomach hurts?  Yes, I did.  I was kind of...  I have to go because I have a stomachache.  Son of a bitch.  Yeah.  I'm getting fired, right?  I don't think so.  I don't think so. 
[03:23:00]  What's the Thursday meeting about?  This Thursday we have a meeting?  That's...  And Ant literally just said that.  Steve Blatter said...  He really said that?  I'm not even joking.  Yeah, Anthony right there in the after show.  Because officially the show's over, so now I'm having my breakfast.  This is one of these, which was described to me as, you know, we haven't gotten together  in a while.  You ready for this?  Yeah.  I swear to you, I can't do Thursday.  I swear to you.  I swear.  So you will not be at the meeting?  Tuesdays and Thursdays, I've got to pick up my kid.  I have no extra time.  Well, if Obie isn't going to be at the meeting, there's no reason for me to be there. 
[03:23:30]  So you will not either?  Honestly, I'm not even joking.  Why?  You could go and tell me everything didn't happen.  No, no.  I'm not going in our stead.  I shan't go in anyone's stead.  So that's...  And then Friday we can't meet because we have to go see The Hobbit.  Plus it's Friday.  And Friday we don't...  In fact, Friday we've got to leave a little early to get to The Hobbit.  We don't meet on Friday.  What?  I'm doing Red Eye on Friday.  I've got to write.  Okay, so Friday...  So Monday.  We'll do meeting Monday?  Well, we've got a screening on Monday.  Screening on Monday.  Another screening on Monday?  Yeah.  I can't make Tuesday either.  Well, Tuesday's bad for Obie. 
[03:24:00]  Tuesdays goes back to the Tuesdays for me.  And the Thursdays.  So are we looking at next...  And Fridays...  But I told them I can't make Tuesdays and...  No, no.  Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  That Thursday might be another screening for another guest.  I can't make Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays because I got my trainer.  Well, Fridays, no one wants to meet because that starts the weekend.  So Fridays are out.  Tuesdays and Thursdays, definitely not because...  Mondays and Wednesdays are off with me.  And Monday is like a horrible day for meetings because you're just getting back into the swing  of things.  So the only shot he really has is Wednesdays.  And Ant's got his trainer.  Not a trainer.  I got my trainer.  I can't. 
[03:24:30]  Do you guys want to do a Saturday morning type thing?  Yeah, I'm going to need you to go ahead and come on in for a meeting.  I did do a weekend meeting.  What?  One time.  Why?  And I swear you I couldn't tell you what we talked about.  I have no idea what we talked about, but I met him in the neighborhood.  Ah!  Yeah, don't wave to me.  Hey, guys.  Don't wave.  Don't say hi.  Hi.  Should we invite him in?  Hi.  Hi.  I don't think so.  I'm just saying hi to the morning mashup.  Is that all right with you, Sam?  I mean, I can be friends with him, too. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah, but you're not.  You always touch his mean things.  You're still waving.  You guys have a lot of screams coming up, too.  A lot of screams.  Screams.  A lot of screams?  You guys got a lot of screams coming up.  Screams.  Screams.  A lot of screams.  What?  You find Ralphie Mae's neighbor?  Screams.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I can't believe Ralphie Mae got fucked in the ass when he was a kid.  That's insane.  Who would have thunk it?  Who would have?  You guys handled it sensitively, going, yeah, not that many people get tagged in their ass. 
[03:25:30]  Tagged in the old ass-a-rooney.  Ah, Stanley, what's up, bro?  Stanley T!  Oh, man.  Come here, brother.  You know I love you.  Yeah.  All right.  He's not coming.  He's coming.  He's coming.  Of course he's coming.  Great.  He's coming.  All this tech's more time.  You know I love you, right, Stanley T?  Yeah, yeah.  All right, good.  That's all I wanted to say.  Stan?  Yeah.  What up, man?  I hope he's been really nice to your show.  I waved to you guys three different times today.  You did?  That's true.  You did, which is rare, actually. 
[03:26:00]  No, no, it's not rare.  You guys don't have anything coming up that a person might want to bring family members to,  do you?  Oh, oh, the 1D crap?  What did y'all say about that?  Nothing.  I mean, have a good time with that.  I call them one erection.  They're cute.  Man, people are crazy over these guys, man.  Really?  For real, for real.  What the fuck is that about?  I know.  It's like insane, for real.  It's cray-cray.  They're the new, oh, good one, Roland.  It's probably the new boy band, the new it boy band.  Yeah, man, but just like.  It's probably tough to get in that room. 
[03:26:30]  It's impossible.  You know, telling me, they won't allow me to bring me.  What?  Let's slow down with impossible.  Yeah, I mean.  Let's just slow down with impossible.  It's impossible.  Everything's possible.  That's your high profile.  Everything's possible, Stanley.  I don't know.  Just listening to the music, I don't get what the excitement is.  I don't know.  Maybe it's like a rebirth.  You're not a young white girl.  I think that's.  Yeah, that'll do it.  Yeah, yeah.  Too black, too strong.  You like gangster rap?  Um, some of it.  Some of it.  You know.  I put the pussy in its place. 
[03:27:00]  No, no, no, no.  Before I nut, I put it out into the face and tell the bitch to keep sucking and prepare  herself for her first butt fucking.  That shit was righteous.  Oh, shit.  That shit was righteous.  That's pretty good, man.  You been hanging out with Sam and shit?  Nah, that was back in the fucking old days.  Oh, ghetto boys.  Ghetto boys.  Anything hip-hop after 1991 is not unacknowledged.  I don't even acknowledge it.  No.  It's all about fucking gangster.  But you know, he's got a little point because that's when the classic shit was written.  Oh, come on. 
[03:27:30]  N-W-A, ghetto boys, that shit.  Public Enemy.  Easy E.  Public Enemy.  Easy E, for real.  Easy E.  You know Ice Cube went to art school, right?  Ice Cube went to art school.  You know that, right?  Did he?  Mr. Legitimate Gangster.  Really?  He went to art school.  You do.  You are aware, right?  Man.  Who?  Ice Cube.  Ice Cube.  Ice Cube!  Ice Cube!  Ice Cube!  Ice Cube!  Ice Cube!  Fucking Bushwick Bill, motherfucker.  Wow.  That was some crazy-ass little midget.  Damn, homie.  Mom playing tricks on me.  Yeah, my mom is playing tricks on me. 
[03:28:00]  That was great shit.  Maybe you should do a hardcore rap album.  Oh, man.  Wouldn't that be great?  Because you got all the guns and stuff.  You know, I've seen this stuff online.  Don't say...  Dag, man, you were like the original fucking Redneck Gangster, for real.  I am OG.  Jimmy brought it up.  His lifestyle is very similar to the rap guy, so he really should like black people.  I like fucking money.  I like making it rain.  Do you make it rain?  I like fucking guns.  And don't say...  That's not fair.  Don't say that the real gangsta shit happened in, like, 1990.  Big Pun had an Uzi to DJ Who Kid's head over a mixtape. 
[03:28:30]  That is fucking...  All right?  That's gangsta shit.  And he didn't go to art school.  No, no.  That's gangsta.  You're right.  You're right.  All right, Sanity.  I just want to say hi.  Hey, love you guys, man.  Hey, I love you, too.  ONA in the house.  I really love what you do with the morning mashup.  Thanks.  I try my biff.  You keep them honest, man.  Before you go, I have a friend who has a couple of nieces that might want to see One Direction.  Yeah?  Good luck with that.  For real.  Oh.  I mean, it's crazy, man.  I'm getting...  The list.  The security guards over here, everybody's asking me, like, I don't have special tickets. 
[03:29:00]  I'm sorry.  Don't have special tickets.  Yeah, we'll see.  We'll see, man.  All right, get the fuck out.  Okay, see y'all later.  We'll see.  I'm not giving up yet.  No, you shouldn't.  We can make it happen.  Yeah, there's that one person.  Cruising down the street in Mile 6-4.  I'm gonna fucking work this shit.  You can go down the hall.  Yeah.  I might have to.  You don't like going down that hall.  For my nieces, I would.  Fucking family.  I haven't talked to that guy in months, but I'll suck it up.  Ooh.  That sounds brash, though. 
[03:29:30]  But it's not him with the other guy who's doing it.  Huh?  I might have to suck it up with that guy.  No, not him.  It's another one.  Who do I have to suck it up to?  I'll take it off the air.  So you...  No.  Is that the part when you think?  Greenstein.  I have to suck...  I have to.  I know.  No, it's the music.  He makes things happen.  Leeds.  Oh, Leeds loves me.  So that means I don't have to...  Suck up an ass.  Wait.  If I can go to Leeds, that means I don't have to suck up the Greenstein, and I don't have  to be nice to the morning mashup.  Yes.  All right.  I'm going to try that path.  Where is he?  Roland doesn't use those pesky vowels.  No. 
[03:30:00]  I understood that.  They're pesky.  Yes.  There's so many unnecessary tongue movements that need be made.  Sam, take it away.  Sam, if you get the good news from Steve Leeds, does that mean the morning mashup gets a  good trashing?  No, but there's no more highs.  That's it.  That's it for the greetings.  You notice the highs all day, right?  All day.  It actually started yesterday, but no one noticed.  Well, I noticed it today.  You waved to them every single time they walked by, like for the whole time they were walking.  Nicole actually waved back, and then she started walking down the hall, and then turned 
[03:30:30]  around all confused.  Wait.  He never waves.  No.  You're not nice to them.  I'm nice to them.  We're leaving the show in competent hands.  Yes.  Because Sam is incompetent.  I was about to say that.  See?  Get it?  I get it.  I get it.  All right.  Ow.  Ow.  Oh.  Boy.  I'm like, this workout's going to be shitty today.  Oh.  It's very hard.  Monday, Wednesday, and Friday suck.  Drinking?  No.  It's like, I still feel a little achy from Monday on Wednesday. 
[03:31:00]  On Wednesday.  You need to miss this.  I did the kettlebells.  Now today's up a bite.  So tomorrow, we've got Jim Chandler.  Why do you say that?  I'm literally stalking him now on Twitter.  Oh, yeah?  I'm trying to figure out a way to, like, you know.  Fill that bridge?  Fill that bridge.  It's your friend from college that we Jack-Tobered, right?  Yeah.  He doesn't talk to you?  What?  Does he talk to you?  No.  No.  He doesn't follow me.  But I started, like, looking at his pictures on Instagram.  Mm-hmm.  Oh. 
[03:31:30]  I'm trying to figure out a...  Oh, and he loves zingers during the commercial breaks.  What?  I love zingers, too.  What do you mean zingers during the commercial breaks?  He does a morning show, and I guess when they go to commercial, that's his weakness.  He gets a zinger.  What do you mean?  Like a joke?  Posted a picture of fucking Abe Lincoln looking like Kramer from Seinfeld.  That's a good one.  You've seen that one?  See?  That's funny.  Funny guy.  Funny guy.  I'm freeing the slaves, Jerry.  And look at this, man.  He's on to the Thanksgiving song. 
[03:32:00]  Thanksgiving.  See, how bad can he be?  I was the OG on that one, motherfucker.  But how bad can he be?  Thanksgiving.  I was the one that brought this.  Oh, oh, oh.  It's Thanksgiving.  Right?  Now, who writes a song that's, like, fucking done?  Like, she's finished.  No one's going to listen to it now.  Guess what?  There's always another Friday.  Right.  Thanksgiving is once a year.  It's once a year.  Good idea. 
[03:32:30]  You know how many Fridays there are in a single year?  52.  Right.  Wow, really?  How bad was that live performance?  Holy fuckaroni.  Oh, on Excess Hollywood?  That was so bad.  She was doing it live, and man, she's terrible.  She's like, ah, very excited.  It's exciting to be so excited about being excited.  With Billy Bush.  She was so bad.  Oh, Bush stinks.  He's the worst, right?  That guy's awful.  He's horrible.  Wow, is he terrible.  He badly wants to be Ryan Seacrest.  But he actually makes it seem like Ryan Seacrest has, like, a lot of talent. 
[03:33:00]  A huge talent.  But he's Bush's nephew, that's why.  What?  George Bush's nephew.  Is he?  Yeah, he is.  For real.  I didn't know that.  That's the guy that's the first gig.  He stinks.  He's horrible.  You stink.  All right, I'm out of here.  Good luck with your thing, whatever that thing is you do after this.  The after show?  After the real radio show.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  Sam Roberts takes over.  It's called a time filler.  What just happened?  Am I on the after show now?  Oh, yes you are.  Welcome to the show.  How the fuck did that happen? 
[03:33:30]  Why wasn't I told?  Technically, there hasn't been a break, so it's not.  Yeah, I know.  So it's still the Opie and Anthony show.  But what happens to the Opie and Anthony show is.  Stay tuned for a grave degradation in the quality of programming.  Bye.  Bye, Anthony.  This shouldn't happen.  Like, what other radio show do I just get left alone in the room?  I guess we'll go to commercial and then start my show next? 
[03:34:00]  Sure.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony show is available later today with Sirius XM On Demand.  You've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.  Finally, the moment is at hand.  After Opie and Anthony's life is coming up next.  Sirius XM On Demand. 
[03:34:30]  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  You betcha it's After Opie and Anthony Live.  Call us up at 866-WOW1-WOW.  We have a bunch of books to give away today, so some of you will get books.  I got the, you know, Jason Tomsky.  I think that's his name. 
[03:35:00]  He was in here with that book about the hotels.  Got that book.  I got the Steiner memorabilia book.  Dr. Robin Zazio's hoarder book.  Greg Gutfeld's book.  I got a whole bunch of books.  Eric's trying to clear out the office, so we're going to give away some books today.  Eric, who's going to be in charge?  Who can I place?  Who has the responsibility of making sure that these listeners get their prizes?  Because there have been a couple people that have called up saying that they haven't gotten prizes won on this show.  Okay.  So who is the Buck Stops Here guy? 
[03:35:30]  This will be Intern Anthony's project.  All right, but who is in charge of Intern Anthony?  Because he's an intern.  That would be me.  Okay, so you're going to make sure he sends everybody the right stuff.  Correct.  Okay.  I have every faith in you.  Were you uncomfortable with the Ralphie May call this morning?  I don't think anybody was comfortable with it.  Especially, hey, when are you in New York?  Oh, end of February.  Long pause.  Well, no, and then what was the word response? 
[03:36:00]  Oh.  Oh.  I can't believe, you know, I guess you forget about the clout that Opie and Anthony have,  that people will put up with their shit, because Ralphie May is just on the phone,  and he's pouring his heart out about the car accident he got in, and getting fucked in his asshole.  No, no, no, no, that's not what they said.  Tagged in the ass.  Getting tagged in the ass.  He's getting molested, getting beaten up by his brother, and all the while, he's just 
[03:36:30]  pretending that he still thinks it's funny when they're playing Full Metal Jacket clips.  When they're calling him Fat Body, he just laughs like he thinks it's funny.  He doesn't think it's funny.  Like, there's no way Ralphie May found humor in that.  Well, what else is he going to do?  I don't know.  He could be like, fuck you guys and hang up the phone.  He could be like, fuck you guys and hang up the phone, right?  He could.  I mean, why not?  That's what I would do.  Not everybody is E-Rock.  Like, you would not treat a person like that.  You were given the opportunity, and you said, no, I will not badmouth him. 
[03:37:00]  No, I was being thrown under the bus, and I wasn't going to have that.  Well, you did say he was lackluster, didn't you?  No, I never used that phrase.  Oh, who did?  That would be you.  You like the bigger words.  That's true.  I'm a very verbose individual.  See?  The other thing I like today, I've never been to Dollywood, but I did used to go to  the Grand Ole Opry when I was a kid, and Opryland, before it shut down.  Opryland is gone, but you want to talk about real country music.  Opryland, my friends. 
[03:37:30]  When was the last time you went to that?  Well, I don't know.  It's been closed down for years, so it was when I was a kid.  Oh.  I mean, I think the Grand Ole Opry is still there.  It's in Tennessee.  That's where, you know, they do all the country music from, but...  And XMS Studios down there, right?  In the Grand Ole Opry.  Yeah.  But Opryland was a theme park that was right next to it.  And I think, yeah, I mean, it's gone now.  I don't know exactly why it shut down.  Greg in New Hampshire.  You're on after Opin' Anthony Live.  Hey, Eric and Sam.  How's it going today, boys?  Good.  Hey, I called earlier today. 
[03:38:00]  I was talking, trying to get on about how the show has suffered a little bit lately,  and I was blaming it on Danny and Travis's inept production.  What?  Okay.  And I thought that they should shit can those guys and give both of you dudes their money.  Oh.  So get this.  That's not fair.  Danny and I go back and forth on the phone.  Okay.  In a full-on brawl, calling each other every fucking name in the book.  This was all going on in the phone screening room?  Yes.  Okay.  And then get this dude.  Here's the fucking killer.  Uh-huh. 
[03:38:30]  I hang up.  He calls me at my house three times.  Who did?  Danny Roth did.  Danny, did you call him at his house?  Yeah.  If he's dumb enough to leave his fucking to call a radio show and not block his number.  Why?  I'll call him again later, too.  Okay, there you go.  It's out there now.  So I hope fucking Bladder and Leeds and fucking Greenstein, all the big dogs here.  Yeah, they all know who I am.  What was the fight about?  Why are you so mad at this guy?  Me?  Yeah.  Nobody cares about how many...  No, he's just going to keep talking.  There's no point.  Greg, I want to know what's got Danny so upset.  Danny is... 
[03:39:00]  No, you're going to have to...  Honestly, you'll have to pot him down.  Well, yeah, I didn't mean, Greg, I want you to tell me why Danny's so upset.  I want Danny to tell me why Danny's so upset.  Well, you shouldn't have asked.  You're not listening to me, Sam.  All right, Greg.  I'm poting you down a little bit, but don't hang on.  No, nothing.  It was honestly nothing.  It was just, he's just another one of these guys who calls in.  What did he say?  Well, he's a guy...  You can hear him a little bit in the back.  He thinks...  He doesn't understand the difference between production and producing a show.  Uh-huh.  So he seems to think that if your production is different than what the other production  used to be, you're not a good producer. 
[03:39:30]  And so I was trying to explain to him that there's a difference between coming up with  production bits and producing a radio show, but all he wanted to do was scream at me  and tell me how much everything sucks.  He doesn't like your bits?  I mean...  He doesn't like anything.  What don't you like that Danny's done?  He doesn't like anything.  Danny, take a breath.  It's my turn, buddy.  Greg, what don't...  See, he acts all cocky like he won something.  Like he calls a radio show and he thinks that's all he had to do to win an argument.  Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg.  How about the Whistling Kenny production piece? 
[03:40:00]  What about it?  That's the only thing that you keep bringing up.  And then you keep bringing up the how much stuff, which everybody loves.  Everybody loves the how much stuff.  Greg, you tell me...  Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg.  Greg, tell me what you don't like that Danny's done.  Okay.  He's going to name the same two things.  He's going to say the Kenny Whistler bit and the how much stuff.  And that's all the fucking guy could say because he's got nothing else.  Danny, you keep talking.  No, you keep talking.  You keep talking.  That's all you do and you don't shut up.  Okay, this is too much.  Nobody wants to hear you. 
[03:40:30]  It's your turn, Greg, Greg, Greg.  Just tell me what you don't like about Danny.  Danny's production is the worst.  Him and Travis did not come up with...  Okay, what if Travis's production does suck?  What are the ideas specifically?  You can't come up with anything that's been worth playing more than like three times.  No.  Half the time it's...  Steve C. is missed.  Believe me.  Steve C. is missed.  And you're the fucking main reason he's out of there because you and Travis fucking undermined  him the whole time he was there.  See, and that's a perfect example.  And see, and listen to me, Greg.  This is a perfect example.  Remember before when I told you that you just don't know what the fuck you're talking about? 
[03:41:00]  This is a great example because you just don't know what you're talking about.  Did you not call my house three times after we hung up, you little fucking faggot?  Did you or did you not?  Listen to how mad he's getting now.  We did.  You said you did.  Oh, of course I did.  Yes, okay, of course you did.  So I was trying to get in touch with you.  It's now out there.  You called me at home and you called me...  Yeah, I wanted to talk to you.  Because our phone call disconnected.  I wanted to get back in touch.  I wanted to get back in touch with you. 
[03:41:30]  Can I talk to Greg next?  Like it's a bad...  You can try to talk to Greg.  It's not going to work out for you.  Greg, Travis wants to talk to you.  Travis is in here.  Hi, Greg.  Hi, Dr. J.  What's your problem?  What's your issue with me?  Yeah, now why are you mad at Travis?  Travis and Danny are...  No, no, no, no.  Leave Danny out of it.  Talk to me.  Hang on.  Greg, it's Sam here.  Your buddy.  It's your pal, Sam.  No, no, I see.  The more words you use makes you win.  And give the money to Eric.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg. 
[03:42:00]  Okay, so what you don't like...  I want to know what your problem with me is specifically.  You're criticizing Danny's bits that he's gotten on the air.  Okay.  Horrible.  Okay.  Okay, that's fine.  Forget about Danny.  What's your problem with me?  Don't mention him again.  Talk to me, Greg, okay?  Travis.  Travis, don't play fucking condescending little fucking know-it-all little do-so.  You see how it is with this fucking guy?  Okay, seriously.  You fucking see how this is?  How come you don't like Travis?  How come you don't like Travis?  Explain to me, Greg.  Don't talk to you.  He's a fucking little kick-you-in-the-balls fucking intern faggot.  Okay?  Nobody likes you. 
[03:42:30]  Do you see why I'm calling this guy's house later today?  You're going to call him again?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I just wanted to come in and make sure that you didn't have a real reason.  Okay.  Travis, get off the phone.  Okay?  Go fucking do this.  You're the one on the phone.  I'm in the studio.  He's on the radio.  Jesus Christ.  Think about your history there, you guys.  You guys are fucking horrendous.  There's-I mean-  Give the money to Sam Roberts and Ewok.  I'm not asking for-  Should we think about-should we think about the history before Sam was around?  Or-or what?  What history are we talking about?  I just want to know why he doesn't like me and he's not giving me a reason.  He's just calling me names.  Because you suck. 
[03:43:00]  I don't even know if that's true.  That's all-  Let me argue.  I thought it was because you didn't like my production.  Let me argue for Greg.  Let me argue for Greg.  He's hanging out.  You suck!  Because!  You there, Greg?  No, Greg hung up.  That's fine.  I don't care if somebody doesn't like me.  I just want to know why.  It is weird that people kind of attach-  Because he doesn't have a real reason for disliking you specifically.  And I get-  I'm assuming, too, that a lot of the bits he doesn't like are probably bits that I've done as well.  Well, he just doesn't know what people do. 
[03:43:30]  Exactly.  Like, you can't come in here and say that Travis's production sucks.  Well, guess what?  I don't do production.  Okay?  That's not my job.  Guess what?  He wants to give money to Eric.  Eric doesn't do production.  That's not his job.  Right, right.  And that's exactly what I tried to say.  That was like my opening statement here.  I said there's a difference between radio production and being the producer of a radio show.  Like, when Steve was hired here way long ago, Steve was a production guy.  That means he didn't produce the radio show.  That means he made audio bits that got played, like, to break and sweepers and things like that. 
[03:44:00]  And then Derek took that over, and now Troy took that over.  It is not my function.  It is not Eric's function.  It is not Travis's function to write and produce radio production.  It is our job to make sure that this show runs the way it needs to run every day, and that we do a fucking damn fine good job of.  But you should also know that you don't need to—I mean, he, as a caller, if he's going to come—I'm not saying this about all the callers, but if a caller's going to call in and start a fight with you, he's coming from an inferior position. 
[03:44:30]  Right?  That's fair.  Yes, absolutely.  With that said, once you start calling him at home, you're bringing yourself down.  You know that.  No, it's because—like, when was the last time I was picking up a phone call in that room?  So it was like—you don't screen—Danny doesn't screen calls regularly.  It was like the three minutes that I was in there, and this little prick had to feel like, you know, his day's going shitty, so he's got to go and feel better about himself.  So I was like, you know what I'm going to do now?  Because this happens on Facebook, too, where a guy—he just talks to me like we're friends. 
[03:45:00]  And I'm like, I don't know this guy.  He'll be like, yo, what's up, dude?  What's going on?  So now, instead of blocking him, instead of all that stuff, I just do it back to him now.  So now I just go, hey, what's up, bro?  How's your day?  Just to kind of give you that—like, that's how you're annoying me.  So now I'm just going to annoy you the same way.  So if you're going to call me and just start running your mouth not knowing what you're talking about, then I will call you and piss you off for the rest of the day.  But wouldn't it be easier for you if you could just let it go?  Dude, I've let it go for the last two years.  This is the first time I'm giving a fuck about one of these little fucks.  This is the first time in two years I give a fuck. 
[03:45:30]  Let me have some fun.  I'm not mad.  This is fun.  This is fun.  I cannot wait to annoy this fucking guy the rest of the day.  There seems like there's some venom there, though.  Because he stands for—it's not like I hate him.  I hate everything that he represents.  Negative, anti-Danny listeners.  No, it's anti-everything.  It's—I'm a privileged cunt.  All I do is enjoy the show and like it.  But I have to find the things that I don't like and then go all the way out of my way to let those people know, and that's the part I have a problem with. 
[03:46:00]  It's like—and I've said this a million times.  I used to be a fan of like Family Guy.  Family Guy used to be a funny show.  It still is.  It still can be a funny show.  But when I don't like an episode of Family Guy, I don't go out of my way to figure out who the writers and producers were and then find out their Twitters and then tell them that they all suck.  Yeah, but you also got to know that just the—and you understand it because you've been a fan of the show and then now you've worked on the show.  Like the nature of this show is that it's completely—we open ourselves up.  And when we do that, the people listening, they feel like they know us.  So it's kind of up to us to set whatever boundaries we want to set. 
[03:46:30]  And once you're calling them back at home, you're removing that boundary.  Well, because it's just—it's just the numbers there and I'm like—and this guy's calling and I'm like, you know what?  And I'm not doing it with grit teeth or venom.  I'm doing it with a smirk and I'm going, I'm just going to copy this stuff and then I'm going to start calling and just piss him off the rest of the day.  Have you been hearing—  It's just that little obnoxiousness that's just going to—it's just going to get under your skin the longer it happens.  Have you been hearing him yell in the office, Danny? 
[03:47:00]  No, I actually lost the number, to be honest with you.  It was in my pocket.  Oh.  I lost it.  Oh, on the phone?  Yeah, I just want to know if you heard his side yelling.  No.  Wait, wait, Greg's calling back.  6-0-3s.  Oh.  No, I just—I could never be—  Possibly bothered to care.  Right?  That's what I would think.  About what these people—  It's funny.  I'm not saying—  No, no, no.  If they're saying nice things, it's good.  I don't care.  Like, yeah, you like me?  Cool.  You don't like me?  That's fine.  Danny, I won.  I won.  You called me three times.  Okay, okay.  Go ahead, Travis.  And you're calling me four. 
[03:47:30]  It's kind of an on-air impact for me to think that anybody could possibly have, like, an  opinion, you know?  Like, you don't know what I do.  The fucking Wikipedia page says Travis typically acts as the phone screener.  I haven't screened phones in four fucking years.  But you're fine with that.  Yeah, I don't care.  Guess what?  I do my job.  Do you like the show that you're listening to?  I've got a hand in that, okay?  You're a behind-the-scenes guy, though.  Yeah, yeah.  And you're happy that way.  Yes.  Yes.  But in the same way that it's fun for him to call us, I'm just saying it's just as fun for  us to call back. 
[03:48:00]  I don't care if he's called him.  I recognize his voice.  He's called me before.  And Greg in New Hampshire, you don't care.  You don't win.  I win because you're the one that goes home and thinks about me.  So I'm the one that wins.  Yeah, but that's where it becomes, once you call him, it's like, okay, well, now you're  leaving the show to think about me and call me.  Yeah, but that was five minutes removed.  I was done with it, honestly.  And he's the one that calls back.  I hear it in the office.  That's the only reason.  And you did a minute ago say you're going to call him this afternoon.  Well, I was because that's the radio.  But to be perfectly frank with you, honestly, I don't even have his number.  I don't even have it. 
[03:48:30]  So.  Hmm.  Well, I mean, I had my 15 minutes of fun this morning, and now this guy wants to run around  saying he's the winner.  Well, that's what's going to happen.  You're the big winner, bro.  You did it.  Steve in Virginia.  Hey, I think this show is much better now that Danny's back on the air like he used to  be.  Because that means less time for Sam.  I agree.  You know, I think that Steve in Virginia.  Somebody give me a pen.  Fire Sam.  Wait, get his number.  I'm getting his number.  Wait, I'm going to call him.  Ah, come on.  I was going to call him and tell him how much I like him.  You can expect some calls from me.  You want to fire Eric, too, because I don't like his production. 
[03:49:00]  That's right, Eric.  When was the last?  I hate all your bits.  Yeah, Eric.  Play a production piece.  Yeah, Eric.  All of your production pieces are bad.  Don't get the panda angry!  How did anyone possibly want to fire me or Danny about production before Sam?  John in North Carolina.  Sam wasn't done yet.  What's going on, Sam?  What's up?  Hey, man, I'm not calling to be one of these fucking trolls that live up north to Pistock  Dane or anybody else.  I just want a fucking book, man. 
[03:49:30]  All right.  A free book.  All right.  I'm going to put you on hold.  John in North Carolina.  What book?  Give me a hotel book.  Yeah, he wants a hotel book.  All right, let me...  Heads in beds.  All right.  Put...  Get John in North Carolina's address.  He's going to get a book.  Oh, I think...  But I think...  But it has to...  You wouldn't be calling him if it didn't bother you on some level.  No, it doesn't bother you.  No, it's just like, okay, well, if you feel comfortable enough that you can call and say  all these things and you think that you know something, well, it's just as...  And I'm just staring at his phone number come up on the phone screening thing and I'm 
[03:50:00]  just like...  I'm like, I'm just going to call you back.  The reason that he's calling in and complaining about you is because you honestly...  You bother him.  Yeah, and he's trying to get under my skin.  And what I'm saying is I'll let him try to and then when all is said and done, I'll spend  the rest of my day getting under his skin.  And I understand what you're saying.  It's basically putting us on level playing fields.  Yeah, absolutely.  But that's what I'm actually trying to do here because I don't elevate myself as being  better than any of these people.  That's what I think the difference is.  Yeah, but you just call them these people.  Well, they are.  I mean, at the end of the day, they're listeners. 
[03:50:30]  At the end of the day, they're listeners and they don't work here.  That's the reality.  That's the reality.  But I don't put myself on a pedestal and I don't think that I'm better than anybody.  Yeah, but there...  When you start calling in thinking that you are, that's when my fucking switch gets flipped.  There's a thing.  When somebody has an opinion about you and you don't know who they are, you're immediately  on a higher ground just because of the way that...  Because they don't...  Yeah.  Just because of what it is.  So once you start getting down there with them, it's like, well, you just gave up your  higher ground.  Zach. 
[03:51:00]  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Just think about it, fellas.  It's 10.30 in the morning and you were able to call this bitch at home.  So he's not doing extremely well.  You're working for probably the greatest for radio show in the history of time.  And Sam Roberts worked there.  So, I mean, you've got to leg up on just about everybody.  I know, but you know what the problem is?  And you make a great point.  But then you say, you repeat and you parrot these things back to the offender and then  they just completely disregard it. 
[03:51:30]  Is that what you're doing in the phone screen room going,  I get to work with Sam Roberts every day.  Well, no, I'm just like, you know, I'll go, look, you're calling me to shit on me,  but the fact that it remains is that I've been here for eight years, dude.  It's just like...  I've watched Sam grow.  I've watched him blossom.  And now I get to see him every day do what he does.  I think Danny won a book.  Do you want a book, Danny?  Yeah, you know what?  Fuck it.  I got a...  Let me see here.  The Hoarder and Me.  Okay, you get The Hoarder and Me.  And Zach, do you want a book?  I hoard fucking...  Well, yeah, I'd love a book. 
[03:52:00]  I hoard pest phone numbers.  What do you want?  Greg Guffell's book?  Yeah, that'd be great.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Get Zach's address.  Zach, stay on hold.  And...  I think anybody...  I think anybody dumb enough to call a radio show  and then talk shit without blocking their phone number  is just an idiot in the first place.  You deserve it.  Speaking of that, Rick in Ohio.  Yeah, hey, Sam.  I just wanted to know if you're happy being Opie's lap dog.  That's it.  Why do...  What gives you the impression that I'm Opie's lap dog?  Because you sit right next to him and you tell him, 
[03:52:30]  oh, you did this, you did that.  How does he know where you sit?  I sit across...  I couldn't...  Opie is the furthest person I sit from at the table.  This is what I'm talking about.  I love this.  I'll get a tweet.  Oh, dude, the replay's messed up.  I don't handle the replay.  Oh, I just figured you did.  Like, these people just assume things.  But, Rick, I mean, I tell everybody in the studio things about what they do.  What gives you the impression that I'm Opie's lap dog?  I just told you.  What?  Explain it to you.  Because you sit next to him.  Yeah.  Because I sit next to him.  And you tell him all the things. 
[03:53:00]  And I tell him all the things he does.  Is that what it is?  Yeah, yeah, pretty much.  Okay, well, have I substantially argued your claim?  What's that?  All right, I'm going to go ahead and...  I think I illustrated my point.  Sam, you know, we share a lot of the same pains.  You know, you get those kind of calls, and I get the Anthony phone calls.  And it's just...  It just...  It makes me...  Like, it used to get under my skin a little bit.  Because, yeah, there was a lot of hanging outs happening.  But you know what?  There hasn't been a lot of hanging outs in a while that people still call, 
[03:53:30]  You fucking suckers!  And I'm like, I do?  I don't...  Do I?  Because I don't remember any...  I don't remember those days anymore.  At least neither of you guys have an entire radio show talking about how they don't like someone's  dog.  Well, that's true.  But also, the people on the show don't like your dog.  No, that's what I'm saying.  And the listening audience.  Actually, Greg in New Hampshire is on the phone.  Dan, you keep saying you're going to bother me the rest of the day.  You know you have my phone number.  Now...  Why are you such a fucking pussy, Dan?  Oh, my God.  Are you officially over him? 
[03:54:00]  I'm just...  Why are you such a pussy?  Seriously, Dan, you've got to reign the man.  I'm a big pussy.  All right, let me ask him.  I'm a big pussy.  Why are you such a pussy, Dan?  All right, well, because...  Hold on.  Hold on.  I get one more call.  Yeah.  My lawyer wife's getting involved, and I swear to fucking Christ, Danny, you're not fucking  going to be working there in two months.  Seriously.  I know.  Okay.  You're sounding really intimidating.  Okay, Dan.  Whatever.  Try it.  Call me one more fucking time today, you fucking tiger.  Keep winning.  No, no, Danny.  No, no.  Keep winning.  Don't call me at my personal residence, you fucking little homo. 
[03:54:30]  What'd you say?  603-756?  No.  3-2?  No.  No.  Okay, let's bring up some little Nicky bit.  What's that?  Little Nicky bit?  Well, he doesn't work here anymore, but I still do, so what's up?  I know, but he crushed you, and so did Mars.  You are such a little fat.  Yeah?  And Mars' career is just fucking fluid right now.  It's just flowing.  Remember when Mars used to work here?  Yeah.  You remember when Mars was our engineer, Greg?  Dan, call me one more time today.  Please do.  Greg, you're going to think about me all day.  No, please do.  Greg, I don't think...  Call me one more time today, Danny.  Greg, you said...  I don't think you could file a harassment claim if you're going on a radio show and asking 
[03:55:00]  him to call you.  Call me one more time today.  All right, bro, I'll get in touch later.  You're asking me.  I won.  You called me at home, you fucking...  No, I won, because you're...  Listen, congratulations, Greg.  You're as mad as you tried to get me.  Congratulations to Greg for winning.  Do you think he'll call again?  Absolutely!  Well, if you don't...  Are you going to call him this afternoon?  Yeah.  I want you to know.  I want you to know something.  Greg, right now, he wants you to call him.  Oh, I know.  And he's going to be all day.  He's going to be waiting for the call.  He's going to be waiting for me. 
[03:55:30]  If I can give you any advice...  I'm not going to call.  Do not call him.  And if he calls in tomorrow and be like, Danny doesn't call me, come in here and just  say, I totally spaced.  I forgot.  I got caught up with something that happened half an hour after I talked to you, and it  escaped my brain forever.  He's going to call you.  He's going to call tomorrow and say you're a pussy because you didn't call him.  I know, I know.  Meanwhile, he knows everything about me.  And I'm like...  And he's calling me a pussy.  I'm like, really, dude?  I'm a big pussy, but here's the tough guy on the phone.  All right.  Very good.  Oh, and then you know what the best part was?  This is the best part.  What's the best part?  You heard his big mouth on the fucking phone, right? 
[03:56:00]  You heard his fucking huge, giant mouth.  He goes, you know, I met you before back at 57th Street.  I said, oh, really?  What do you mean?  He goes, oh, I used to come upstairs on the bleachers.  I said, well, how come you didn't say anything back then?  And he goes, well, because...  Because...  Master Poe.  And I said, oh, so you didn't say anything back then?  Because you're a pussy.  Because you're a ninja security guard.  Where did my sleeves go?  Scott in Syracuse.  Speaking of the little Nicky thing.  I am dying to hear the co-fucking-cane again. 
[03:56:30]  I didn't know what he meant because it said...  I honestly...  It said toe.  It said toe-fucking-cane.  And I was like...  Brightest people.  He wrote toe-fucking-cane.  Don't forget that.  You're right.  You're right.  Danny's had hits.  But...  He's had plenty of hits.  According to Greg, he's also had quite a few misses.  But everyone does.  Everyone has hits.  Everyone has misses.  It's the nature of the game.  Justin.  If you can't acknowledge your bombs, you're just in denial or a liar. 
[03:57:00]  Yeah, and once I do have a bomb, I'll be the first to admit it.  Justin.  I mean, not Justin.  Yeah, Justin in New Hampshire.  I want to know when Danny's going to get his own radio show because I've been a fucking fan for a while.  I had one.  It was called The Saturday Night Virus.  And then this management company decided that it wasn't worth keeping.  Fucking bullshit.  And here's the thing.  I'm in New Hampshire.  I'll find Greg.  And I'll cut his fucking head off.  Well, I mean...  We can't endorse that.  I mean, I can't endorse it, but I also...  Just like Greg in New Hampshire languish in the fact that he's got a call and tried to get a radio show peripheral character upset. 
[03:57:30]  Same way...  That's his bag for today.  And the same way we can't endorse it, we can't control what anybody does.  So who knows what's going to happen.  It wasn't like I'm going to beat him up.  I'll cut his head off.  I'm going to cut his fucking head off.  I like those guys in my corner.  That's nice.  That's a guy who's waiting to cut someone's head off.  He's been looking for a reason.  He's got a machete in his house.  I'm going to use this one day.  I'm going to have a reason. 
[03:58:00]  I said about Greg, how come he doesn't come up to me?  This is the guy that does come up to you at the live event.  I said, hey, dude, I'm the guy.  I said, I cut a motherfucker's head off.  And then you're like, okay, well...  Would you like a Budweiser?  I got the knife.  I'm buying.  Jeff.  Jeff, what's up, buddy?  Yeah, I'm...  This guy is a freaking moron.  This Cameron Downey.  I used to work in radio.  And I don't produce in a show.  It's a pain in the ass.  And you turn around and you've got to do the production for your own show, too, on top of that. 
[03:58:30]  Which, that's what I had to do.  I had to produce my own show.  And do the production.  And prep it.  We're going to go to Logan.  He's going to...  He's just boring.  That's why you had to do your own production.  You couldn't hold anyone's interest.  If anybody wants to know how radio actually works, like, you just have to watch private  parts over and over and over again.  It's the best radio movie I think I've ever seen.  Logan.  Not like there's a million of them.  What's up?  What's up, buddy?  Done.  Just wanted to get a free book.  All right.  I've got the bits and heads one already. 
[03:59:00]  You want the Steiner book?  Please.  All right.  Hold on.  Logan's getting the Steiner book.  Give me that.  So I know it's giving away.  Big pop of fun?  Yeah.  I'll read that book.  Holla!  It's called Holla If You Hear Me.  Yeah.  You've got to have balls.  By Brandon Steiner.  Holla If You Hear Me.  This one's for my freaks.  Forward by Rick.  By the dog-faced grimoire.  He wouldn't even be able to do the forward.  They'd get so much better.  Catherine.  Hey, I really want that hotel book.  You take the author's photo. 
[03:59:30]  You do, Catherine.  I do.  Hey, Sam.  I went to Ursuline.  Do you know where that is?  Of course I know where Ursuline is.  It's in New Rochelle.  It's real close to it.  So you used to wear one of those uniforms.  Yes, I did.  How old are you?  I graduated in 2000.  Oh my goodness.  What are you doing now?  I'm a marriage and family therapist.  You still got that uniform?  Yes.  You ever wear it?  No.  Well, she wants a book.  You know.  I really, I really, really want that hotel book.  All right.  Well, what are you going to do for me there, Catherine? 
[04:00:00]  I don't know.  Sam, why don't you meet Sam at the hotel?  I'll give you the book.  I am married.  I'm not going to be married.  So am I.  That's not what we're talking about, Catherine.  Don't take it there.  Do you still live in Westchester?  I moved.  I just moved from White Plains to Brewster.  Who would move out of Westchester?  I'm kind of over it.  I want to.  Over it.  I don't know.  I don't know the experience.  All right.  Well, what do you want to, what do you think you should have to do for the hotel book, Catherine? 
[04:00:30]  I can tell you guys that I love you and I really, really want that hotel book.  Yeah, but do it like.  I travel a lot.  Do it in a much more like, can you do like in a sexy way?  It's just like being like, oh, I love you guys.  It's like, whatever.  But if you could do like, you know, a little sexy way.  Like, why don't you tell me, Danny and Travis.  Yeah, my feelings are hurt.  Tell me something nice to me.  What you would want to do to our sexual organs.  If my husband is listening, which he probably is.  He's probably not.  Oh, he definitely is. 
[04:01:00]  He will kick my ass.  It's Catherine from Brewster.  She went to Ursuline.  There's a million of you out there.  So, yeah, no.  Just talk to us about our penises.  Oh, my God.  No.  Well, you said you wanted the book.  It's like you can't call up and ask for something and not expect to, you know what I mean?  It's a give and take situation.  Yeah, but we're like neighbors.  I know.  Exactly.  You know what?  All right, so what do you do?  All right, so we're neighbors, and you're peeking in that window.  I just got out of the shower.  What do you see?  What are you thinking?  Just hair.  That's it.  That's all I imagine. 
[04:01:30]  I see your hair.  Yeah?  I see you.  I caught you looking at me, Catherine.  Oh, my God.  What are you thinking?  This is creepy.  I caught you.  What are you looking at?  Oh, my goodness.  What do you want to do?  I want the book.  That's what I want to do.  What do you want to do with that book?  Put that book in your mouth.  Yeah?  What do you want to shove that book?  Oh, my goodness.  Huh?  Huh?  I just want the book.  I'm really, my husband is having anything.  You're going to shove it in?  You're going to shove it?  She's going to.  She's going to shove it in. 
[04:02:00]  She's going to shove it in.  Oh, my goodness.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Put all those words in your brain.  What about E-Rock?  You like E-Rock?  Get all that knowledge in there.  Talk to me about E-Rock.  E-Rock's great.  Yeah?  What do you like about him?  I don't know.  He's cuddly.  What do you think?  You're cuddling him?  You know what that just meant, by the way?  That's like when they're like, oh, yeah, he's jolly.  He's cuddly.  What do you think?  What do you think if I...  My dog's cuddly.  What would you think if you were cuddling with E-Rock, right? 
[04:02:30]  Spooning.  You're the little spoon.  What cartoon's on TV?  You're the little spoon.  He's the big spoon.  And all of a sudden...  What season of Futurama is it?  All of a sudden, there's something hardening on E-Rock.  And you can feel it.  It's a steel loaf of bread.  My artery.  Did you just...  That was funny.  Eric fucking nails his own joke.  Did you just gag a little bit?  You just go like this?  Ooh.  Oh, my goodness.  All right.  Well, then, who would you want to talk about? 
[04:03:00]  Me?  Eric?  Danny?  I actually think Anthony has a nice voice.  Yeah?  You think he has a nice voice?  What else do you think is nice?  I don't know.  Do you like that dick?  It's very nice.  I've sucked it many times.  Oh, my goodness.  That's the only reason I'm here.  I heard he has a big one, though.  You like him big?  Oh, I really...  I'm going to get beat.  This is not...  With what?  With a dick?  Oh, my goodness.  Hopefully with this book.  And everything's sexual.  All right.  Give me the hotel book.  You want a hotel book, Cassie.  I really do.  But tell me.  Tell me this.  Yes. 
[04:03:30]  After you're done reading this hotel book,  you're going to finger yourself a little bit?  Oh, my goodness.  You're going to play with yourself a little bit?  Oh, my gosh.  Is that the noises you're going to make?  Oh, my goodness.  It sounds like a chipmunk.  All right.  Put your speaker down.  Put your speaker down and straddle it.  Oh, my goodness.  Ooh, I felt that in my headphones.  You did?  You liked it?  Yeah, I got an eargasm.  All right.  All right.  All right, Catherine.  But, Catherine.  Catherine.  Yes.  Are you wearing panties?  Hello.  Oh, my gosh.  Are you?  Just real quick.  Are you wearing them right now?  Yes, yes. 
[04:04:00]  Why don't you take them off?  Oh, God.  I'm driving.  That's really not possible.  Who are you driving with right now?  Who's in the car with you?  Myself.  Me.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah?  What are you doing?  You got your left hand on the steering wheel?  John DiBella, I'm coming after you.  What are you doing with your right hand?  It's holding the phone.  Why don't you pinch the phone between your ear and your shoulder there?  Put in a hands-free device.  Get those hands free, and then you know what I want you to do?  Keep that hand on the steering wheel, but you got your right hand free, right?  She should take the phone.  No, it's still holding the phone. 
[04:04:30]  Just start touching yourself a little bit.  She should rub the piece of the phone that you talk into on her hairstyle down there.  Yeah.  Can you rub your phone on your vagina, please?  Wait, I'm...  Oh, my goodness.  We can make a...  Wait a minute.  We can make a game out of this, you guys.  Just real quick.  Just rub the phone on your vagina.  No, I'm not rubbing the phone anywhere.  All right.  Don't rub the phone, then.  Don't rub the phone.  I'm going to do some production really quick, because Greg says I don't do enough production.  Here you go.  You did this shit now? 
[04:05:00]  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  Wow.  I'm pretty good.  Place the receiver upon your beaver.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  It's time to guess what's in my pants.  My pants.  Is it a landing strip?  Is this what hacks feel like?  It's a landing strip, right?  Oh, my God.  I knew it.  I got it right.  I got it right.  Did you guys hear that? 
[04:05:30]  Did you...  Thank you.  Thank you, everybody.  Thank you.  All right.  With that, we have to go.  I'm going to let you go, Catherine.  Thank you.  Do I get my book?  You get the hotel book.  Oh, I'm so excited.  But I want you to call back tomorrow, okay?  All right.  And I want you to be naked.  Oh, goodness.  Okay, hold on.  Jeez.  Hold on.  After that, I think we should get Reagan on the phone.  All right.  Catherine's on hold.  Here.  We're going to get Ronald Reagan on the phone.  Hello.  But that's all going to happen tomorrow. 
[04:06:00]  Danny is going to go back to the office and call some of the listeners that he doesn't  like.  I'm going to call that woman for phone sex.  I got her number, too.  Travis is going to forget any of this happened and go back to his family.  E-Rock is going to have some lunch.  And I will be back here tomorrow.  What about Sal?  Sal has done nothing all day and will continue to do nothing.  Well, he has to show up first.  Stay tuned.  Is Sal not here?  No, that's right.  He hasn't been here today.  Why is he not here?  He called me he was sick.  He's not.  How is Sal taking more sick days in the first six months than I've taken in my entire career?  I don't know, but you're right. 
[04:06:30]  He's taken more than you and I combined, probably.  Well, let's address it tomorrow.  Christ almighty.  I could have sworn he was here, too.  None of us knew.  And it's 11.
