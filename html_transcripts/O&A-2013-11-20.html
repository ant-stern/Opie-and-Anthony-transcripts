<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, and Jim Norton engaging in crude jokes and banter.  They launched into a discussion about workplace frustrations stemming from an upcoming studio remodel, specifically complaining about the choice of stone (or tile) for the lobby and the relocation of the "Morning Mashup" show.  Financial mismanagement was also a point of contention. The conversation then took a sharp turn towards a heated and offensive debate on race relations in America, triggered by a CNN news story.  Callers Jamal and Sean participated in the discussion, which included criticisms of Oprah Winfrey, Al Sharpton, and George Zimmerman, and  explored black-on-black crime and the perceived hypocrisy of political correctness.  The segment continued with discussions of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's scandals, criticisms of David Blaine's and Criss Angel's magic tricks (including a memorable mention of a "Shaq balloon" used in a Criss Angel illusion), and the alleged corruption of the culinary union's influence on the legalization of MMA fighting in New York.  Surprisingly, Criss Angel himself called in briefly.  Further discussion about Rob Ford’s struggles with alcohol and weight followed, along with a discussion of the death of white supremacist Joseph Paul Franklin and the story of Elmer and Gus, a same-sex couple who married later in life. This portion included graphic sexual humor and offensive language regarding homosexuality.  The hosts then played and commented on several homophobic 1950s and 60s public service announcements. The segment concluded with analysis of Google Earth images capturing unusual events,  mention of an upcoming UFC fight featuring Dominic Cruz (who was slated to be a guest later), and complaints about the Sirius XM app.

The show continued with an interview featuring MMA fighters Dominic Cruz and Ricardo Lamas.  The conversation started with an off-topic discussion about a video of public defecation, transitioning into a discussion about fighting, injuries, judging in MMA versus boxing,  and the mental fortitude required in the sport.  Callers asked about chronic masturbation and dealing with a disrespectful spouse. The segment ended with promotion of upcoming UFC fights in Newark.

The show’s final segment featured Jim Norton fielding calls and giving advice.  Mike from Texas discussed marital problems related to his wife's financial support of her sister; Norton suggested passive-aggressive tactics.  A heated discussion about big game hunting and Melissa Bachman followed, with Norton expressing strong negative opinions.  John from Westchester detailed a volatile relationship with a wealthy, older feminist, and Norton provided relationship advice.  Jordan expressed discomfort changing his baby daughter's diaper, fearing being perceived as a pedophile; Norton reassured him.  Doug from Syracuse discussed the impact of his restaurant business on his relationship, receiving advice from Norton. Finally, Zach confessed to cheating on his wife and expressed guilt, with Norton offering advice.  The show concluded with advertisements for Steven Singer Jewelers.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, yo, what's up out there?  How's it going?  How's it going?  That is not good.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  It's time to find this offensive.  Just don't listen.  But my guess is you'll be sticking around.  Let's do this.  It's going down jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, this is good radio right here. 
[00:00:30]  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  One of the most popular radio shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  They swear and they're vocal and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  The show is twisted.  I'm telling you, who's enjoying this shit?  That's what you like, isn't it?  Anthony.  I want dick prizes.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Remember that. 
[00:01:00]  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, he would say, die.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  That's the shit for me!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh! 
[00:01:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  somebody's out here. He's probably taking a shit  or something.  Good morning, Constitution.  Doing what he does best. 
[00:02:00]  How is everyone?  Delightful.  Fucking nose is itchy.  And my eyes are itching.  And I'm a running nose.  You're allergic to cats. You gotta get rid of Beavis.  Oh, that's it.  Yep. No.  Very obvious. Let's put him down.  No. Leave little Beavis alone.  My eyes are itchy.  I was just driving in my truck.  Driving, driving, driving.  Maybe it's because I was blasting the heat.  Right.  Did you hear about the elevator? 
[00:02:30]  Oh, did I ever.  Wow, man. You didn't hear about the elevator?  No, but Chip just almost fired off a home run.  What happened on the elevator?  Well, Kenny's informing everyone  that the elevator  is going to be out of service for...  Hold on.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  For four days.  He goes,  Did you hear about the elevator?  I'm like, what?  And then I'm thinking  we're going to have to walk up to this floor,  which is, what, 36 or so?  Whether someone was crushed getting into it. 
[00:03:00]  Right.  He goes,  They're doing some construction  and the elevator's going to be out for four days.  I'm like, okay.  So what do we do?  He goes,  You're going to have to take the elevator  to the 37th floor  and walk down one level.  Yeah, it's the lobby  that we get off on,  on the floor that we're on.  We get off on that lobby.  And the lobby is being remodeled.  Right.  So the elevator works,  but we can't get off on the floor anymore  by the lobby.  So we've got to go up one floor  and then walk down the stairs one floor.  But he made it sound like, 
[00:03:30]  you know,  it was going to be a major fucking hassle.  Oh, boy.  Thank you, Kenny.  Look out.  I appreciate the elevator news today.  Yes.  We're going to be very inconvenient.  He goes,  Big news.  Is that big news around here?  It's the scuttlebutt around the water cooler.  Yeah.  What are they doing now?  What are they doing now with our money?  They're remodeling the entire lobby.  With our fucking...  Remodeling the entire lobby.  That's cool.  That's great.  Our event money.  Yeah.  I think the wood floor is going to be like stone. 
[00:04:00]  Are you kidding?  No.  Oh, yeah.  That's cool.  There's the event money.  Or our studio money.  Yeah.  Or many people's raises.  But again,  this goes to what Opie was saying  about shine it up real nice  and put it on the old fucking chopping block.  Oh, yeah.  This place is being shined up real nice.  Yeah.  There's two things that happen here.  They remodel.  Yeah.  And they take care of Howard.  And that's it. 
[00:04:30]  But if they think that's successful for them,  who am I to say?  They eat,  they swim,  and they make little sharks.  Right.  But, you know,  it's time to say it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They remodel,  and they make sure Howard's well taken care of.  Uh-huh.  Everyone else,  go screw.  Go screw yourself.  It would be nice to walk into a fresh new lobby once it's done.  With stone?  Stone.  Oh, yeah.  But at every turn,  they claim they have no money for this, 
[00:05:00]  no money for that,  no money for raises,  no money to put into your studio,  no money to put into your event.  Go outside.  There's stone everywhere.  There's rocks everywhere.  It's like free.  I'd rather go to a nice event  that is part of our show.  Oh, yeah.  And instead of being robbed.  Well,  Mel Karmeson had a very good,  you know,  philosophy about the whole thing,  which at times...  Have a good time all the time,  Marty.  That's my philosophy.  I didn't fully agree with,  but...  Yeah.  He kept, like,  the place looking real shitty 
[00:05:30]  because it's radio...  Right.  ...and the listeners  don't...  They'll never know  that there's a stone lobby.  What if it's a media destination?  True.  Are we going to be a media destination?  No.  What do you mean no?  You're not believing  in the media destination thing?  We already are.  Ah!  I don't think we're  a media destination.  We get some fine,  fine guests, but...  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we'll be  on this shitty work. 
[00:06:00]  We're a media fucking  stopover.  Right.  We're a media layover.  We're not quite the destination.  We're a media crash site.  Yeah, a media fucking flop house.  Media is on the lam.  It stays with us for a night.  Remember when your mother  would want you to pay a rent?  This is not a flop house.  Oh, yes.  Right.  My mom used to say  that all the time  when my friends would come over  for parties on Friday  and Saturday night.  Yeah.  And then she would get home  and the couple  were still laying around.  She goes,  What is this?  A flop house? 
[00:06:30]  What's a flop house?  I don't know,  but I had to take the word  flop off my front door  if I realized it wasn't.  But a flop house  sounds fun, man.  It does.  Sounds nice.  He just flopped.  Actual stone is going  into the lobby?  Kenny's got something.  To my knowledge, yes.  Yes, Kenny.  With a lump.  I could tell you  some more gossip  if you're interested.  Kenny's the king  of gossip around here.  Do tell, do tell.  He works the hallways.  You guys know this already,  but the morning mashups  moved to a new studio.  What?  What's that have to do  with anything?  That's great.  What do you mean? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, they're not there,  so they might not come  by our neighborhood anymore.  Where are they?  Where are they,  and what happened?  They just moved  down the hall further.  To where, though?  A nicer studio?  It's nicer than the one  they had.  Is it nicer than this?  No.  Okay, because I've been  eyeing a few places.  And it's not new.  It's different.  It didn't cost any money.  So why are they  over there now?  It's just a little bigger.  And where are they?  Oh, it is bigger.  They're like on the...  Near the windows? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, on the other side.  Window view,  other side of the glass.  Yeah, they're on the east side.  I'm going to miss them.  So now Cousin Brucie  just gets his own  little studio there,  or who else does that?  Cousin Brucie.  Cousin Brucie.  Once a week, maybe.  That's what they said.  They were sick of  doing a morning show,  and you're just looking  at Cousin Brucie's  stupid face all morning.  Oh, God, that's right.  They had that big guest  in there with his face?  Yeah, Lady Gaga comes in  and it says,  Cousin Brucie!  A big sign,  and she's like,  Oh, really?  And the window is  completely covered up 
[00:08:00]  with old Cousin Brucie pictures.  Like, you could walk  by the studio,  and you can't look in  and see the morning mashup.  Do they have a...  Is it brighter now  or something?  No, it's actually darker.  Really?  Why do they like it so dark?  I don't know.  They broadcast in the dark?  They do.  It's very dark in their studio.  It's not conducive.  No, not to a morning mashup.  You think,  Hey, turn off the lights,  good morning, everybody.  Morning mashup style.  Ugh.  I like a dark, mysterious...  No.  Yeah.  You never know  what's going to happen,  who's grabbing who's crotch. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, nice.  Oh, wow.  Enjoy that.  What's going on there?  Nicole's new big, giant tits.  Yeah.  You know what you can tell  to Nicole,  and you can definitely  tell Stanley.  Oh, yeah.  If you grab his,  you probably don't.  If you grab his.  All right,  so there's the big news today.  Elevator's out for a few days,  and according to Kenny,  that's a major fucking problem  for everybody.  But we'll have a fresh new lobby,  a little sacrifice.  What kind of stone?  It's like, uh...  Marble?  It's not like shiny marble.  It's like granity.  What do you mean granity?  No, not like stone. 
[00:09:00]  I need to know  what kind of stone.  It's like stone that I saw.  And how do you know?  Because I saw him laying it down  to see what it would look like.  Laying it down?  Oh, yeah?  So did you take a picture of it?  No.  Why not?  Because we did that shit.  Stone.  It's on a wood floor.  Where is this stone?  Is it in a closet somewhere?  I don't know.  I don't know why.  You want to get to it before?  I want to see how expensive the stone is.  It's like a dull stone.  Like, not shiny stone.  I'm not just fighting for us.  I'm fighting for everyone  that hasn't had a razor on here.  And now they're laying down 
[00:09:30]  expensive stone?  Well, I mean,  it's not going to be cheap stone.  The lobby's big.  Are they still moving the staircase?  That I don't know.  I think...  That was too impractical.  And where are we at  with the new rugs?  What stage?  Oh, we're well along  into that stage.  We're almost done with the...  the 37th floor.  Is that why our hallway  has turned into  the fucking city dump  over here?  Yes.  The fucking...  There's a rolling little dumpster  and boxes of trash 
[00:10:00]  and old wires  and fucking electronic equipment  from the 80s.  Why do they do  the rugs upstairs first?  Because no one sees those rugs.  Oh, boy.  Maybe it's easier.  I don't know.  Because that's where  the fucking brass lives.  That's probably it.  But the logic being  if you're trying to impress people  like celebrities and stuff,  they would be coming  through this floor.  But you're not.  So why when you start  with this floor?  You're not.  I have a guess.  Yeah.  Because if they timed it right,  they did it upstairs,  they're going to be doing  part of around here  during the holidays and stuff.  Maybe when there's 
[00:10:30]  less people around.  All right.  A real answer, possibly.  Holy, holy Christmas.  Yeah.  What a bunch of scrooges.  Although all that shit  in the hallway  that makes it look like a dump.  Uh-huh.  We had an intern  come back and visit  just to say hi.  Yeah.  He was here a year  and a half ago.  The liar?  Yes.  Of the party?  Yes.  But he walked through the hall  and said,  I think all that stuff  has been here since I left.  Oh, really?  Well, I figured.  Cardboard boxes  of wires  and piping  and conduit.  Did you get an answer 
[00:11:00]  from Greenstein yesterday?  I never saw him.  I went down  and he was in there  with somebody.  I didn't ask for him.  I just looked at him  and saw that he had  somebody in there  so I walked away.  Trying to get some  real answer  why our promotion,  our event  is not happening  unless we come up  with $350,000.  Extortion.  When you say it like that,  it sounds funny.  Pure extortion.  What?  What do you think it is?  Like you've got to come up  with $350,000  if you want to do this event.  That makes it really sound 
[00:11:30]  extorty.  That's pretty much  what it is.  If you explain it differently,  I'm willing to listen.  Could you imagine that?  Then we had to see  the posters  and the websites  all dedicated  to a huge birthday bash.  Could you imagine  going to promotions  in the old days  of radio  when you were  at a regular radio station  and saying,  yeah,  I got an idea  for an event  and they're like,  oh, okay.  And then you kick it up  to management  and they're like,  oh, that's good.  Yeah.  Hey, give us a fuckload  of money to do that.  You're like,  what? 
[00:12:00]  What?  Right.  You'd be like,  what?  XM wouldn't have done that.  It's unprecedented.  Oh, XM wouldn't have done that  because they understand  the value  of something like that.  A huge,  over-the-top event  raises us up.  There's a value.  Oh, there's a value  to it  on their side, too.  A lot of serious  signage,  an opportunity  to make money  through sponsorship  and whatnot  instead of shaking  down the talent.  Oh, well.  Do they shake him down  for the event? 
[00:12:30]  I bet not.  Or are they shoving  more money?  More money.  Here.  Here.  Unless that's  a contractual obligation.  No, I'm sure it's not.  No, of course not.  I'm positive this is just...  It's an expensive venue.  Oh, yeah.  Huh?  Where is it going  to be held?  Hammerstein.  So are they holding  up the Hammerstein  for a few thousand?  A few shekels?  They're probably  going to pay the...  Hammerstein.  But the Hammerstein  is going to get  a lot of free promotion  out of this.  That Howard Stern's 
[00:13:00]  birthday bash is there.  Are we going to?  So shouldn't they  be holding up...  They should be holding  up the Hammerstein  for some cash.  No?  Why should they get  all that free promotion,  right?  And Sam,  do you know the difference  between stone and tile?  People are asking.  Of course.  It's not...  It's not tile.  No, it's stone.  It's not...  Alright, stone is way...  way classier than tile.  It's not going to look  like a bathroom.  It's not going to look  like a kitchen floor.  How big are those  stone pieces? 
[00:13:30]  Big.  Bigger than a tile.  Like this?  Yeah, probably...  Like the ones I saw...  18 inches?  Ooh.  Yeah, maybe 18 by 18.  Pavers?  Pavers, yeah.  I don't know what  pavers is.  That's what you can  make like patios out of.  Oh.  Stone.  Stone.  Not tiles.  Interlocking?  Well, I don't know.  Very good question.  Very good question.  The lock killers.  Good thing Bob flew in  to handle this.  Which one?  Which thing?  This whole thing  that's happening.  Good thing the agent  flew in.  Yeah, he gave up on it. 
[00:14:00]  Grout, Sam?  Grout?  Will there be grout?  I believe there may be  some grout.  Oh, jeez.  Uh-oh.  I don't think...  No.  No grout.  Alright, no grout then.  No.  Then that's one big  piece of fucking stone.  Well, then we'll need  some grout.  It's just gonna be like  one piece that they're  gonna lay in on the floor.  Right.  Yeah.  No grout.  That'd be some grout.  No grout.  Like a little bit of grout.  Mm-hmm.  I think I should crash the bash.  Very good news. 
[00:14:30]  CNN at 7.40 a.m.  will discuss the N-word  with a Major League Baseball player.  Oh, good.  Can we roll tape on that?  Oh, that's gonna get a lot done.  Sure, they'll be talking  about it like adults  saying the N-word.  Yeah, just like adults.  Now, Brian Gumbel  has a different take  on the N-word, speaking of.  He does his show,  what is it, Real Sports  or whatever, on HBO?  Oh, yeah.  And he's going after  what Charles Barkley  said recently,  which we said on this show.  Uh-huh.  Which, basically, 
[00:15:00]  Charles said,  look, you know,  I use the word  with my friends,  and he doesn't care  what color you are.  Yeah.  You should be able  to use it.  And Brian Gumbel  is taking the angle  that no one...  Oh, Christ.  Shut the fuck up.  No one should use  the N-word,  no matter what color you are.  How about...  They were just showing  a clip of a knockout game.  Finally, the media  is picking up on this.  Been talking about it  for well over a year,  and they're finally  picking up on it.  What do you mean  over a year?  This is a year old already? 
[00:15:30]  Oh, yeah.  The knockout game  has been going on  for quite some time.  Yeah.  And they're finally  talking about it.  How about using it  in that instance?  I'll tell you why.  By the way,  I'll tell you why  that they're talking about it  because Thomas Sowell,  who's...  I think that's  the USA's last name,  a black writer.  He's a really great writer.  Wrote a big piece on it,  I think,  for the Daily News.  So now they're okay  to talk about it.  Yeah, yeah.  Now they're talking about it.  Yeah.  Well, it's just...  Whoa.  What floor is this?  37.  So the stone  has already been laid  on the 37th floor.  Lucky stone.  See, stone. 
[00:16:00]  That's tile.  Now it's stone.  That's some sweet-ass stone  right there.  It's not tile.  It's stone.  That looks about...  That looks like  it's 18 by 18.  Big bathroom.  Well, there's two pallets  of it in the lobby.  Well, I thought...  Right now?  Yeah.  That's tile.  Let me see it.  No, it's like  an inch thick stone.  Doesn't matter.  What's the difference, then?  It's tile.  Go look.  It's in the lobby right now.  It's tile.  It's stone.  It's stone with some grout.  It's got to be grouted.  It's fucking tile.  It's stone. 
[00:16:30]  Not a bunch of rocks.  I want pebbles in there.  Right?  Like a gravel driveway.  You come walking in...  Your high heels, you fall.  Maybe it's...  That'll roll.  Maybe it's slate.  Ah.  It's slate.  Unless it's all one big piece.  It's a fancy slate.  It's tile?  Yeah.  No.  No.  Like, stone is like  a big granite slab.  Something like that.  They're big enough.  Why don't you go down there  and study it?  From the picture,  you can't tell  if it's tile, slate, or stone.  It's stone.  I don't have 
[00:17:00]  one single piece of a fuck  to give about  what they put in that lobby.  I wish it was  a giant fucking hole  that they cover with leaves  and people step in.  Well, you shouldn't be first.  Tough booby trap  with punji steaks in it.  I think you should give a fuck  because it's more money  just being thrown away.  That's exactly why.  That's why you really  should give a fuck.  Oh.  Because then the next time  we ask for a little something,  they're like,  oh, God, I don't know  where we're going to find  the money for that.  But the logic never works out  anyway.  Even if we tell them,  like, what about that?  Ah, you know.  I've caught them so many times 
[00:17:30]  in that logic stuff  and it never matters.  How about just catching them  in a million lies?  Absolutely.  You know that Scott Greenstein,  I was outside this hallway,  I go, this is what we want to do.  We want to, you know,  we want that studio.  And he goes to me behind us,  you know, the famous wall thing,  which was going to,  how much was it going to cost again?  Half a million.  Yeah, $500,000.  But then I go, okay,  I understand you want to put  Entertainment Weekly in there,  which is going to be  just a bust of a channel.  We all know it,  but good luck to you.  I go, how about you  just give us this much?  And I put my hand like this.  I'm like, just give us to here. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  You know, meaning give us another,  I don't know,  five to six feet back.  He goes, okay, no problem.  He literally told me that.  No problem.  Because he just wants to,  he just wants to be done with you.  Yeah, everything is in the moment.  So it's easy just to say  in the moment,  yeah, no problem.  And then down the road,  he could like, you know,  tell you why, you know,  that's not happening.  Maybe you misunderstood.  Maybe he said, no.  Problem?  Oh, God.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Knockout game has been going on 
[00:18:30]  in my high school  since the late 80s.  Yeah, it's an old thing.  Oh, yeah.  The knockout game.  They used to do that in, uh...  It's just a game, though.  It's okay.  Oh, that's right.  People are dying.  The old, old days,  I heard about that.  Like, years ago,  I don't know if they called it  the knockout game,  but you just walk up to somebody  and punch them in the face  and knock them out.  I mean, that's been forever.  And they're like,  teens are going up.  Be honest.  Teens, yeah.  It's groups of black teens  just going up  and smashing people in the head. 
[00:19:00]  They're targeting fucking Jews, though,  and that's...  Jews out in...  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, good luck there  because them Jews,  they will stick together.  They will make a to-do  about this.  Good.  Well, you hope they target  the wrong Hasidic  who has a fucking machine gun on them  because he works  in the Diamond District.  A lot of those guys are armed.  If they work in the Diamond area,  they're walking down the street  with a lot of money.  But, you know,  those guys are fucking strapped, man.  Oh, yeah.  So you hope that they walk up  and try it with one of those guys  while another guy's there  with a fucking pistol. 
[00:19:30]  Why?  So that guy has to go on trial  and fucking, you know,  be called all kinds of names  and shit.  But in this case,  it proved it to be accurate.  There's a boob.  Well, he's a boob,  but of course,  I still think he was self-defense.  He was served with divorce papers, too.  Keith Robinson had a very funny tweet  Zimmerman only pulls a gun  on women and children.  That was really funny.  Oh, very good.  He's not a big Zimmerman supporter.  No.  Very good.  Ah.  Yeah, his divorce papers.  Yeah, he makes bail in there. 
[00:20:00]  There's his soon-to-be ex-wife lawyer  with the divorce papers.  Oh, tired of Anthony being Zimmerman's  a cheerleader.  There.  Then don't listen.  Bounced.  Goodbye.  Not his cheerleader.  I'm just saying one thing  doesn't necessarily have anything  to do with the other.  He could be a complete asshole.  I've always said  I don't know what he's like,  and judging from the news,  his personality does seem pretty shitty.  I'm not saying that.  I'm saying  it doesn't mess with the facts  of a case  that was determined 
[00:20:30]  to be self-defense.  That's all I'm saying.  No matter what the fuck he does,  it doesn't fucking matter  what happened with that case  in a court  with evidence that was presented there.  I think it can shed doubt  on a person's story.  No matter what,  like if you hear a guy  who says,  I was arrested for beating my wife,  and then all this stuff is,  people kind of feel like  he did beat his wife,  but you can't technically prove it  because she's a black guy,  but she could have hit the doorknob.  All right.  But then he gets in another relationship, 
[00:21:00]  and he fucking,  his girlfriend's like,  he punched me.  Right.  It does shed some doubt  on the first.  It sheds some light  on his personality,  but if you just look  at the facts of the case,  he was getting his face beat  and so fuck it.  Fuck it.  I'm just so tired of it.  Tired of what?  Of the whole race thing.  It's out of control.  It's out of fucking control.  This is some of the worst  fucking relations  between the races  that we've had  since fucking Jim Crow laws. 
[00:21:30]  And it's, you know,  I don't know what it is.  I have my theories.  Oh, no.  Actually, my theories.  What's your theory?  It's fucking the fact  that Obama's president,  it gave everybody this attitude.  It gave a lot of black people  an attitude that, you know,  things like the knockout game  and fucking welfare  and yelling racism  because he criticized the president  is a fine thing to do.  Political correctness 
[00:22:00]  has gone one way  like crazy.  The hypocrisy  is insane.  And it's just,  it's fucking...  People are playing knockout  because we have a black president?  No.  The lack of, um...  The lack of any real fucking  discipline  doing anything about it.  People are afraid  to even talk about it.  They shiver into 
[00:22:30]  when they talk about race.  Ah, am I going to say  the wrong thing?  Oprah comes out  and talks about, you know,  all the racism  that's going on  because the president  gets criticized  and it's all racism.  It's not the fact  that he's doing  a shitty fuck job  as president  of the United States.  But people can say,  it's my,  I swear to you,  I'm not playing devil's advocate,  but white people  are the problem  because white people  are the ones  who are full of shit  and scared.  White people are full of shit.  You're right.  Someone can come right out  and just tell...  But Oprah's a fucking dumb cunt. 
[00:23:00]  So what?  Someone can say to Oprah,  that's bullshit.  I'm not blaming white people  because Oprah's a fucking idiot.  No, no, no.  But who cares what she...  What I'm saying is  what she says  is not important to me.  Because now she's  got this empowerment.  All of a sudden  she's empowered  and what she says  is fucking like gospel.  It's been like that  for 20 years.  Nah, it's ridiculous.  Literally she's had that  since 1985 or whatever.  She's got whatever she says.  She makes books bestsellers.  When the race card comes out  it's fucking infuriating.  It's fucking infuriating.  It only means anything  if white people listen to it. 
[00:23:30]  If white people  don't feel guilty  and don't feel like  they have something to hide.  You know what I mean?  It doesn't...  I'm not putting all the blame  on white people.  Because white people  are the ones  making the decisions.  I've never had  a black boss  sit me down.  Oh, you know what I mean?  I've never heard  of black bosses firing.  It's always  fucking white people.  You're right.  You can blame white people  for not reporting accurately  the crime stats  that involve black people.  You can blame them  for not reporting 
[00:24:00]  the fact that  in Chicago and Detroit  murders  black and black murders  are running rampant.  You can.  But that doesn't excuse  the fucking behavior  in and of itself.  It's deplorable.  But the behavior  hasn't changed  in the last 20 years.  Like in shitty...  Yes, it has.  But I mean...  I think it has.  White people are the ones  who when you discuss it  they get uncomfortable.  Yes.  And they back up.  I've never had a...  It's not uncomfortable  for blacks to talk about race.  It's uncomfortable  for white people  because there's that whole...  Well, the way blacks 
[00:24:30]  talk about race is  we can talk about it  but you can't.  So I'm sick of that  whole fucking thing.  I'm so fucking sick of it.  But you know how  you and I talk about it  and all we talk about  on this show?  Like if everyone  just discussed it honestly  maybe without the language  or in real life.  Well, in real life  when you discuss it  we get phone calls.  Every time we fucking  discuss this  we get phone calls  from black guys  that are all pissed off  that we're even discussing it.  So it's fucking disgusting 
[00:25:00]  the place we're at right now  as far as race goes.  But if you're able  to talk about it  and not have guilt  and not feel bad  which I don't  and you certainly don't  then there's no...  And if everyone  was that honest  about their own shit  then people wouldn't  be getting fired  for stuff like that.  But then you got  like Brian Gumbel  comes out and says  something too.  He can say what he wants  but I mean...  But what he says  isn't outrageous.  He's saying  no one should use the word.  He's not saying  only black people  should use the word. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, that's realistic.  But I don't agree with it.  And white people  are not parading around  with a song  that has fucking  used the word  nigger  fucking 80 times  or 120 times  in the song.  Hold on a minute.  Here we go.  We haven't done this yet.  Oh no.  We haven't done this yet  on our show.  Jamal, North Carolina.  Hey, what's going on?  Hi Jamal.  What's up Jamal?  Not much.  Now, what Anthony's saying 
[00:26:00]  believe it or not  I agree with him.  Alright.  I know call me crazy  or whatever.  The problem is  that he's not  open dialogue.  I'll try that.  The shit that he be saying  you know  about the animals  The shit that he is saying.  If you want to work  say the shit that he is saying  not he be saying.  Okay.  That's not fucking  proper English.  Well shit.  You're not going to get a job  and then when you don't get a job  people go  oh why  why  why are black people's  unemployment rate  twice that of whites?  Perhaps if you go  into a job interview 
[00:26:30]  and speak like a  fucking human being  doesn't he agree with you?  I don't give a shit.  This guy's on your side.  I've had it.  Let me answer that.  Yeah.  Actually I'm just about  to get off work.  Alright.  Make over $140,000 a year.  What?  Nice.  Righteous.  Making a guap.  That is guap.  That's guap.  Here's the important question.  Do the right thing.  Are they hiring  for when we get  we're out of here?  Are they hiring by the way  for when we're no longer working?  I can use that.  The point of it is 
[00:27:00]  the point that I'm trying to make  and if you'd like me  to speak proper English  Yes.  But I'm sorry  but the point I'm trying  to make is this  I did not go to school  I'm self-taught  in computers  and engineering  etc.  If you want something  you have to work for it  and that's where  a lot of black people  or even white people  in general  don't have that drive  and don't  you know  everything's not a scratch ticket  and boom  I'm rich  I'm famous  and this and that  the other thing.  I also don't like that 
[00:27:30]  that's a cop  what you just did  you unconsciously  just uttered  a cop out  fucking thing  black people  and white people  and white people  there are some things  that are indicative  to certain races  white and black  and fucking Asian  and German  there are differences  we have  as people  and people  don't want to identify that  if there's a negative  if there's a negative  that is indicative  to one race  everyone has to lump  all the other races in 
[00:28:00]  and say  well it happens  but no one wants to  identify that there's  a distinct problem  in certain other communities  and address it  thusly  instead of addressing it  you go  well everybody  and it's like  no  no  and I hear you with that  wait a minute  and I hear you with that  so all white people  have  have  a perception  a self-perception  about  you know  about  how black people are  so I could say  hey all black  all white people  I'm never saying all  and I never say 
[00:28:30]  all black people  do this or that  my usual response  is  there's a  disproportionate number  is what I usually say  Jamal  I say a  disproportionate number  which  shows that there is an issue  there's some type of  problem  when there's a  disproportionate number  of criminals  of crime  of fucking  deplorable  violent behavior  these are  issues that need  to be addressed  the fact that  blacks are  killing other blacks 
[00:29:00]  in numbers that  far exceed  the  national average  of  people  other than blacks  is  astounding  and the lack of it  being addressed  by the media  and by black leadership  is  just  how does  this  that  happen  now  now  well  there's a couple  of things with that  now first off  I agree with that  you know there's a lot  of black on black crime  and this that  the other thing  and I take to  the exception 
[00:29:30]  that  the quote unquote  black leaders  no one  I'm black  but no one has to  lead me about anything  I lead by common sense  so the Jesse Jackson  the this that  the other thing  the people with the money  handouts  they're just comical  to me  all right  so  so that whole  black leader thing  and again  that's the white media  who made them  quote unquote  our leaders  which they don't really  talk about  yeah I understand that  I've heard that before  okay  yeah but  but they're not  talking about real issues  now you're right  blacks are killing  blacks wrecking numbers 
[00:30:00]  this that  they could blame  crack this that  the other thing  but the point of it  is is that  they're  it should be talked about  there should be more arrests  we should be disgusted  I'm disgusted  I'm totally disgusted  by the whole thing  well your voice  is not being heard  then  no and by you  saying the things  that you're saying  I think it's only good  because it should start  an honest dialogue  it should  some things that you say 
[00:30:30]  I could disagree with  and and this that  the other thing  but when it  but you know  I could disagree  but as an American  I would die  for you to say  some of this stuff  because it's freedom of speech  and you can't play it both ways  and everyone should be able  to have an honest discussion  about it  exactly  people kill  everyone or whatever  and I get  and I kind of get upset  when people  do you understand  how calculated  people have to be 
[00:31:00]  when they do openly  and honestly  discuss race  in this country  how when you watch  the news  and they do have  some type of forum  on race  how people are  tiptoeing  around the issue  how they  they're afraid  you could  you could  absolutely see them  consciously choosing  every word  so that it can't be used  out of context  what people are tiptoeing  the white ones  oh exactly  yeah yeah yeah  whitey  a bunch of  a bunch of fucking  dumb guilty whitey  a bunch of guilty  because usually 
[00:31:30]  when people tiptoe  it's because they have  something to hide  and they don't mean to  but it's like  if you're just being honest  and you're not being aggressive  or being an asshole  you can always have a discussion  and you're not going to  get in trouble for it  if you express an opinion  that you think language  it's because  they have something to hide  and that's what they call  the pussification  well yeah  I'm just not going to  I'm just not going to  sit here  and think that  that whitey  is completely responsible  it's almost as if  you're just  blowing off the black race 
[00:32:00]  as a bunch of  children  that need to  you know  be coddled  and protected  and then just blame  the parents  no  I think  I think  the black community  needs something called  responsibility of actions  that is  just doesn't seem  to be out there anymore  there's a multitude  of excuses  for every fucking  deplorable act  that I see out there  alright Jamal  I'm moving on  we gotta move on  thank you 
[00:32:30]  let's say hi to Sean  in Massachusetts  Sean  hey  I just called Anthony out  he wants to be able  to drop the end bomb  without anybody getting mad  but he's getting mad  at Jamal  for saying we be  and we are  that's totally different  I'm saying  I wouldn't  put it this way  I wouldn't walk  into a job interview  and start dropping  the end bomb  I'm not saying  I'm not saying  that  I'm not saying  that people should  be able to use  horrible words  and slurs  in every situation  that's ridiculous 
[00:33:00]  and if he's hanging  out with his friends  and wants to say  we be going  somewhere  or whatever  that's fine and dandy  I'm just saying  there is this  there  I'm saying  another problem  in the black community  and the reason  I think  that unemployment  is so high  has nothing  to do with racism  it has something  to do with  the perception  of your potential  employee  when they cannot  speak  this is something  that's been addressed  by a lot more  powerful people  than me 
[00:33:30]  Bill Cosby himself  has addressed  this issue  a lot of black  people that are  put in  high position  and praised  have said  the same things  and they're educated  it's an education  problem  white people  yeah it's an education  problem  that's what it is  throw more money  at it  let's see what  happens  meanwhile I just saw  a story yesterday  where a school  had a giant brawl  happen  and the parents  are upset  because they cut  back on the money  for security  on the school 
[00:34:00]  so they need  more security  that's what money  should go to  when you allocate  money to education  it should go  to prison guards  to fucking  prison guards  in your schools  so they're not  beating the living  shit out of each other  how about that  is taken care of  by parenting  by parents  that educate  their kids  that when you  go to school  you don't treat  the cafeteria  like a fucking  prison yard  and you try  to learn  and make something  better of yourself  but no  blame it on the fact  that white people 
[00:34:30]  aren't paying enough  taxes  and enough money  isn't going to  inner city schools  that's such horse shit  too  enough  enough  oh yeah  you're just looking  for the racist  because you are a racist  that's what I am  I'm a racist  I hope you get  I hope you're a victim  of the knockout game  sir  I avoid  I avoid people  that are involved  in the knockout game  oh you're profiling  that's terrible  what a racist  you are  profiling  I'm educated  oh  alright thanks Sean 
[00:35:00]  why are you so  fired up today  what's going on  with you  I'm just disgusted  with this whole fucking thing  I see it in your eyes  you're all fired up  what's up  it's an allergy  what's going on  what happened  nothing  I'm just fucking  I'm disgusted  just disgusted  with the whole thing  enough  yuck  that  and the stupid fucking  you know  event that we're supposed to do  it's got me pissed  yeah  it took a lot of oxygen  out of the room  once again  we believed  stupid us  yeah  and I know a lot of people 
[00:35:30]  I've read on twitter  not a lot of people  believe me  it's just a couple  of people  they're like  dude  no fucking  he just talks about race  no I talk about  dick jokes too  and vagina  and big tits  but it's a big  it's a big issue  it's the fucking  the as they call it  elephant in the room  that is  is rarely addressed  in an open  and honest fashion  but it's always  hinted to  I'm not bringing up  something that isn't  right there  in the fucking room  it's not right there 
[00:36:00]  every day  you watch the news  and you see it  it's there  I'm not breaking  new ground here  I'm not talking about  something that isn't  being discussed  every day  and being  addressed  in some way  whether it's  some passive  aggressive way  or  subdued  but it's out there  I'm just fucking  talking about it  but of course  the second  just like that guy  all of a sudden  racist  oh  the scarlet letter 
[00:36:30]  R  these days  oh it's terrible  to be called that  you're fucking  demeaning  what a racist is  yeah I talked about  this yesterday  I did that HuffPost live  oh I want to play  oh I loved it  did you find that  and you caught shit  for it too  did I?  yeah I saw  I lambasted  some gentlemen  oh I didn't even notice  they're like oh  real brave  oh I saw  and I'm like  yeah it is brave  to talk about those things  because no more  people aren't doing it  and he goes  oh people don't bash  Sharpton  that's not the point 
[00:37:00]  you fucking idiot  the guy was dumb  because the point  of that was  the guy the host  was good though  we talked for probably  15 or 20 minutes  and this was just  a minute clip  they put up  but we were talking  about racism  and all that stuff  and one of the points  was I said  people are so scared  of being called that  but I have no fear  of it  because I know I'm not  it's not like  oh no  I have no fear  that in an argument  or a discussion  somebody's going to  uncover something  in my personality  which proves elitism  I have zero fear  of that  here's the clip 
[00:37:30]  from yesterday  it's on HuffPost  right now  this guy was good  happened right now  specifically  I mean you tweeted  about Alec Baldwin  and MSNBC  what did you think  about that?  I have no problem  with Alec Baldwin  saying cocksucker  or faggot  or anything in the language  my problem is  with MSNBC  and they mete out  punishment arbitrarily  I don't care  what anybody says  none of it should be  you know  it's a guy  he said he was sorry  he was angry  we act in this country  that we don't understand  why Alec Baldwin  would say something rude  to the vulture paparazzi  like that's how  backwards we are  they actually harp 
[00:38:00]  on the language  he used  instead of the  piggish culture  which loves these  photos of people's  personal lives  like it's this great  diversionary tactic  oh my god  he said the F word  that's not the issue  the issue is  we live in a place  where there's  something interesting  about 50 photographers  standing around  watching a guy  put his kid in his car  and the rest of us  don't see anything  wrong with that  so I don't care  about Alec Baldwin  my point was  if you're going to  punish him  and yank his show  what about Al Sharpton  no one has said  worse things publicly  than Al Sharpton  does anybody  white interlopers 
[00:38:30]  in front of  Freddie's fashion martyr  this was many years ago  those Greek homos  he has said  horrendous things  you know  the lie about  Tawana Brawley  the guy's been  an absolute pig  for many many years  and he gets away with it  because everyone's afraid  just to tell him  exactly what a  complete asshole  he really is  so MSNBC hires  this jackass  and then they're  going to hold  somebody else  to language standards  while he's out  you know  having said  the things he said  come on  it's just silly  nice  I close with silly  silly 
[00:39:00]  silly is a harsh word  silly  it's a great clip  great clip  thank you man  we want to apologize  someone said something  earlier in the broadcast  is Alec Baldwin  coming back to MSNBC  it's officially done right  yeah but he might  have been difficult though  they might be saying  like he was difficult  to be around too  like  but I think it's probably  that if anything  you know  right  this is the second one  unbelievable  MSNBC 
[00:39:30]  fucking fantastic  yikes  and someone else  called up  like one of the questions  and they're like  why do you know  why do you do Fox  so much or whatever  so I don't mind  answering that  and  you know  I said  Hannity defended us  I'm like  where are all these liberals  who is Hannity defending  this show  and  and then  the guy goes  and I said  CNN is just as biased  and no one's calling you  from MSNBC  that's a big part of it too  ask me to go on CNN  I'd be happy to  I think you'd go on in a second  I'd love to 
[00:40:00]  yeah  I did Joy Behar's show  yeah  alright  right  so  alright  there's a great article  by the way  in the post  by a woman named  Jillian K  Melkier  whatever her name is  just in the opinions  about a union's low blow  to MMA fighters  and it's about the  fucking piggish  I keep saying that word  Sheldon Silver  and the culinary union  and how they are fighting  to keep MMA  illegal in New York  the whole thing  is absolutely a lie 
[00:40:30]  and bullshit  not her  but it's the only state  in the union  that it's illegal in  we are an embarrassing  fucking state  that's Sheldon Silver  I hope he fucking  falls down an elevator shaft  I hate that guy  aren't they  still trying to use  the lie  that it's because  it's violent  oh it's also the lie  is some of them  because some fighters  have made offensive comments  oh come on  it's a lie  stop it  it's because  the culinary union  they don't like  the fact  that the Fatidas 
[00:41:00]  have a union  a casino in Vegas  which is non-union  and the Fatidas  are willing to allow  what they call  a secret ballot  to see if their workers  want to be unionized  a secret ballot  but the culinary union  says no  I guess what it's called  is a card ballot  where they want it  to be a public vote  and the reason for that  is so they can intimidate  people who are not  union  but the Fatidas  are all for a secret ballot  like go ahead  vote  and if you want it  you can have it  and they don't 
[00:41:30]  and so the union  is so mad  that they're using  the culinary union  in New York  of course  because Sheldon Silver  is just a fucking  whore for them  and they are all  that's why  that's why it's not legal  in New York  it's all union  fucking bullshit  so anyway  great article  in the post today  and I'm happy to see  it getting writing  Chris Weidman  the fucking middleweight  champ is from Long Island  he's saying what a disgrace  it is  we have a champion  from here  who can't  by the 20th anniversary  that was just fought  in Vegas  you know how much  Dana would have loved 
[00:42:00]  to have done that here  you know how much  fucking money  is being  is being  not  brought into New York  our taxes go up  they complain about money  and this is a  they said about  700,000 people in New York  get these pay-per-views  it's fucking  disgusting  how much money  they'd make  in Madison Square Garden  or on Long Island  or they'd probably  do it in  what's Jay-Z's  the Barclays  they would do it  in Brooklyn too  I'm sure  it's absolutely  disgusting  yeah  yeah  so please continue  to support that 
[00:42:30]  and just let  just know  that the culinary union  is behind the whole thing  culinary union  but again they don't  make it happen  Sheldon Silver  they can only push  and they can only pressure  they don't vote  in that assembly  that's Sheldon Silver  and those other creeps  ridiculous man  wow what a corrupt  fucking state we live in  totally  food's here  we're gonna take a break  we'll get into the Rob Ford  clip of the day next  there's more huh  oh god  thank you  and a great little thing 
[00:43:00]  from Family Feud  Family Feud  and other things  thanks  yeah  the open entry show  the open entry show  for serious  XM  the open entry show  the open entry  the open entry show  continues  Joe Walsh 
[00:43:30]  66  and out of his mind  right  I love this new record  analog band  you loved it  I heard that  Jimmy and young Sam Roberts  interviewed him  yeah interviewed Mr. Walsh  yeah  we couldn't be bothered  when we  yeah 
[00:44:00]  when we bolted out of here  early I guess  bolt out of here early  he was great  yeah you can be more polite  about it  what  I heard the interview  it was good  I just  I mean  I'm not saying  to that  I mean  I couldn't be bothered  with it  that's the part  I was talking about  who cares  yeah  exactly  what is Rob Ford  doing today  chilling  he's just chilling  not really  he had another moment  yesterday  yeah he did  Rob Ford  was on the  Today Show  with Matt Lauer  he loves attention 
[00:44:30]  what was the video  I don't know  it was the video  Matt Lauer went to Toronto  he went to Toronto  yeah  with his old man beard  yeah  that doesn't look good  yeah  what's he doing  anyone else watching  the Today Show  with the beards  Al Roker looks creepy  Matt Lauer looks creepy  Willie Geis is still  handsome as shit though  fuck yeah  I must get his  cock sucked  yeah he does  oh man  he's  he was voted  sexiest man  on the news  or something  he's sexy as hell  something like that  damn  he's gonna be 
[00:45:00]  a rock star  for NBC  they're moving  him up fast  but this is what  Rob Ford had to say  to Matt Lauer  a bit harsh  a bit on the harsh side  with his brother  with him of course  but he ain't taking  shit from no one  this Rob Ford  the mayor of Toronto  and now he just  pals around with his  brother huh  well his brother  controls all his  interviews now  oh really  I guess his brother  is the smart one  oh because  his brother is  responsible I see  yes  wasn't he the one 
[00:45:30]  with the  the hashish  the hashish  dealer possibly  he's the hash  dealer guy  from back in the  day and also  was he the one  that was called  with the bottle  under his desk  I don't know  or was that  Rob Ford's office  I think that was  Rob  oh okay  he achieved fame  by going into  city council  and demanding  that everybody  who's ever smoked  weed  yeah stand up  yeah  be counted  these two rule  here's today's  Rob Ford clip  check it out  sitting down  you said  what happened  in city council 
[00:46:00]  chambers is  unprecedented  it's never  happened before  what went on  in there  they basically  took away  383,000 people  who voted for me  their rights  you have brought  disgrace to this  office  and you know  that's true  I'm embarrassed  not just myself  my family  my friends  my supporters  the whole city  I take full  responsibility  for that  apparently not  we've all made  mistakes Matt  it's the famous  taking full  responsibility  thing that drives 
[00:46:30]  me insane  because it means  nothing  you don't think  he's taking full  responsibility  I guess in this  case full  responsibility  would mean to  just step down  just leave  yeah  that means  holy fuck  I gotta take  full responsibility  here because  everyone is really  pissed off at me  the responsible  thing to do  would be to  step down  and let the  another mayor  come in  and run the city  if you're saying  I take full  responsibility  I don't know  what that means  when these idiots  say it  what does that mean 
[00:47:00]  nothing  they're just  acknowledging a wrong  but there's no  consequence  for acknowledging  the wrong  yeah  it's really  strange  I do like that  question Matt  Lauer asked  I like the way  what the disgrace  Matt Lauer's a  very good interviewer  at times he's great  yeah  you're a god damn  disgrace  taking full  responsibility  would probably  be leaving  the office  and going  to jail  or at least  some kind  of rehab  situation  yeah  that's the  responsible  thing  right  because  you know 
[00:47:30]  we're saying  the same points  over and over  again  but I just  don't believe  you smoke  crack once  I just  don't believe  that  it's not one  of those  things to be  like oh  I can't  believe how  drunk I  got last  night  I smoked  a bunch  of crack  yeah  right  by the way  Matt Lauer's  a dick  he's a good  interviewer  but he's just  a dick  he couldn't  let the  compliment go  another phony  another phony  you couldn't  just let it  be  he's a good  he's just  a dick  and why does  Bush look so  young now that  he's out of  office  he was on 
[00:48:00]  Leno last night  I wanted to fly out  and meet him  but he's laughing  oh you were  trying to arrange  it  oh yeah  it's hard though  with the secret  service  but I would  have flown out  there and  just gone  to meet him  the secret  service  Jimmy would  have to  deal with  the secret  service  knows your  name  now  hi guys  this is  Jim Norton  why does  he want  to meet  the president  tell him  no  they must  have a  limited number  of people  out  David Blaine  got to do  a magic trick  for him  was he out  there  no not  live  I mean  earlier  for his  special  that hack  what's wrong 
[00:48:30]  with David Blaine  you see the  stupid quarter  trick that was  all over the  entertainment shows  last night  did he make it  disappear from  the year or  something  he just had a  switcheroo  he asked for a  quarter  and then he  like switched  the quarter  out for his  bendy quarter  yeah  and then  the broad  had to put  her initials  on the  bendy quarter  and then  through the  power of  whatever the  fuck  they squeezed  hard  and then the  quarter bent  it's so  hacked  was he on  his special  or was it  just on  like the  shows 
[00:49:00]  I think  it might  be part  of his  special  I don't  know  he was  doing his  street magic  which he  does pull  off  he does  more than  pull it  off  he pulls  it off  he's alright  with that  shit  I will  I will  alright  well when  he does  the  folding  quarter  trick  you know  how hacked  that fucking  trick is  Sam Roberts  that one  sounds like  it's a little  back  look I will  give fucking  David Blaine  kudos and  props as they  say  compared to  the ultimate  hack that  is Chris 
[00:49:30]  Angel  yeah that  guy sucks  Chris Angel  it's gotten to  the point now  where it's like  a fake show  about a  magician  his show  believe  oh yeah I was  watching last  night they had  like a fucking  marathon going  on  it's pretty much  boiled down to  anyone can do  this if you have  a camcorder  and some  family and  friends  what you do  is you gather  people around  that you  obviously know  or are paid  or family and  friends  you have a  camera  and you become 
[00:50:00]  proficient in  editing  because that's  all that's  going on now  no it's not  Chris Angel  he has people  there that go  oh  and he probably  does all those  reaction shots  separately  yeah  and he edits  he did something  last night I was  watching and of  course he's trying  to be like socially  conscious and it's  this homeless guy  and he's wheeling a  shopping cart full of  junk  and he's got a  coat on top  a winter coat  and Chris Angel  pulls up the 
[00:50:30]  fucking coat  and he goes  oh winter coat  here  oh this looks  warm  maybe you need  something a little  lighter though  because it's not  that warm out  he walks up  to the camera  with the coat  and blocks  the camera  with the coat  and then comes  away  and puts the  coat over  the shopping cart  and pulls it  away real fast  and it's full  of food  for the homeless  guy  that's magic  and the homeless  guy's going  thank you  thank you  and they block  out his face  and stuff 
[00:51:00]  but it's some  black guy  and of course  the thank you  thank you  is because  someone just  wheeled a shopping  cart filled  with food  in front of him  he was an actor  oh they don't  even  that's the point  I'm making  it's not even  magic anymore  hold on  hold on  I gotta break  this down  so the homeless  guy  is an actor  and you can tell  he's an actor  so why would you  do the same trick  because it's all  editing  where you get  the homeless  guy  and you just  wheel a cart  of food  in front of him  you're gonna get  the oh my god 
[00:51:30]  thank you so much  and then you do  the fake bullshit  magic trick shit  edit it nice  and then you got  an obvious homeless  guy reacting to that  I'll tell you why  because a real homeless  guy probably doesn't  do a good take  two and three  no you don't need  a take two or three  if you wheel up  a cart of brand new  food he doesn't even  know he's part of  a magic trick  he's just gonna  freak out that  you're giving him food  but if you don't get  the camera angle  then the homeless  guy have to mic him  he smells  wants to put the mic  on a stinky guy  it's the disappearing 
[00:52:00]  so this is a  chris angel type  trick the magic  that who kid  pulled off  on his instagram  that's pretty amazing  what who kid  that's more amazing  than what david blaine  does okay  no it's not  and by the way  chris angel  big attack  I heard your interview  with david blaine  you guys were like  two minutes away  from blowing each other  he liked me  I fucking listened  that's bullshit  he just took the  picture later  fucking sam roberts  is all in with  david blaine  and his hackery  dude he's the fucking man  maybe you can make  your awful voice disappear  get you a fucking gig  you don't need to 
[00:52:30]  like david blaine  to make it in this  business sam roberts  I don't like him  with his squishy  foldy quarters  you don't think  when he does  close up street magic  that that shit is cool  that's all hand shit  yeah it's good  I'm not saying  he's actually a wizard  that's where every magician  starts  I could show you  a bunch of guys  along the island  that are really good  with their fucking  the sleight of hand shit  is this who they were  filming the other day  why we couldn't go  to the bathroom  yeah  no they're doing  a commercial I think  this is it  what is this 
[00:53:00]  oh yeah  I don't know  it's um  free listening  Mark Goodman  Mark Goodman  he's doing a little  thing for Sirius  being played on  Fox News channel  what is it  it's a commercial  all morning  you can listen to  Sirius XM for free  as long as the app works  is that what's happening  if you have an old radio  they're turning it back on  or something  it works for a couple weeks  like ones from the 30s  okay  no  old Sirius XM  one of those old ones  right  so the homeless guy  is a fake homeless guy 
[00:53:30]  yes  everyone is fake  by the way  I hate that shit  when everyone  on that show  is fake  and an actor  why can't they  figure that stuff  out for movies  and TV shows  in Hollywood  right  when they have  a homeless guy  it's so obvious  yeah  it is so obvious  oh it's just  our friend Ricky Gervais  being impressed  by David Blaine  that's all  well Ricky Gervais  is a fucking  media whore  okay  he'll do anything  I'll give it to  I love Ricky Gervais  that was just a quick  fucking  try to joke  his big stunts 
[00:54:00]  suck  his big stunts  suck  David Blaine's  big stunts  they stink  no they don't  but his magic  his up close magic  and shit  is very cool  and he took ownership  for the fact  that the upside down thing  was a total disaster  oh he did  he said it  yeah  oh you asked him  yeah  oh you did ask him  a tough question  in between blowing him  oh man  I didn't blow him  you love David Blaine  he's the fucking man  but I asked him  don't make me  don't make me pull clips  I didn't blow him  no no I didn't 
[00:54:30]  I didn't blow him  I didn't blow him  I didn't do that  OB  no no  but the trip  is gonna be good  we're gonna stop off  in Ohio  and then  we're gonna go  get gas  what a collection  of tards  in the middle  of a discussion  about anything else  pops in with nothing  who's worse  David Blaine  or Criss Angel  Criss Angel  oh god  Criss Angel  1 billion percent  that magic  Criss Angel  is the worst  magician  I've ever seen 
[00:55:00]  I think at this point  the worst  the worst  worse than like  a birthday party magician  yes  he's horrible  horrible  at this point  I just want to  see Penn and Teller  I'm not a magic guy  anymore  I can't stand  the shitty tricks  that he wore  but he doesn't  even care  he doesn't even care  and then I realized  maybe Criss Angel  was never good  can we see  a Criss Angel  trick  find a Criss Angel  trick  one we haven't done  in a while  from this show 
[00:55:30]  believe  fuck yeah  I like what you do  with your hands  when you say that  you gotta believe  it's very  mysterious  hold on a minute  let me say hi  to Eric in New York  Eric go ahead  love you  love your show  yeah of course  well get in line  are you a magician  yes you are  it says that  okay and  you're gonna explain  the squishy  foldy quarter bullshit  I'm not explaining it  because I do it  but he doesn't  switch the corner  I'm sure he could  look online  and figure out  how he does it  but he does not 
[00:56:00]  switch the quarter  why don't you  just explain it  nobody's  what do you mean  he doesn't  switch the quarter  like if he's  getting the quarter  from the person  you can't fold  the quarter  everyone knows that  he  they sign the quarter  before he gives  it to them  and he doesn't  switch it  I mean I'm not  lying  I'm telling you  he doesn't  switch it  wait he gives  the quarter  to them  he borrows  the quarter  they sign it  before he  touches it  and then  he bends it  I'm not saying  it's real magic  but he doesn't  switch it  how does he  bend it  I'm guessing  through heat  so you're  just a guy  where do you 
[00:56:30]  perform  David Blaine  is getting credit  for the same  trick you do  that's what I'm  trying to tell  Sam  this is a hack  fucking trick  that a million  guys have done  that's one trick  on the special  agreed  he does  do some  things that  other people  don't do  but he does  he does  do a lot  of tricks  that a lot  of guys  a lot  of good  a lot  of hacky  fucking  tricks  you know  who bends  fucking  steel  my friend  stainless  steel  stainless  steel  don't forget  superman too  superman can do  that shit  stanley bends  metal  that's true  oh yeah  honestly  he does that 
[00:57:00]  why won't that  guy give away  the trick  who gives a fuck  I don't know  he's doing a  birthday party  this weekend  he's a magician  yeah  he's magic  so what  david blaine  already has  the code  the fake  quarter  it's not a fake  quarter  he puts magic  in the  yes he does  fuck yeah  sam  go lick  david blaine's  ass  wizardry  david blaine and I  have started a nice  relationship together  you can be jealous  all you want  but he's a great guy  mo for each other  I mean I would  mo  yeah 
[00:57:30]  handsome dude  magic  no one would be  a great trick  if he stops  breathing  wow  why do you want  david blaine  dead  because he's done  everything else  how cool would that  be  he tried that  he's done the  water thing  he's done the  fucking upside down  thing  me and boss  went to one  back where we  live when he  first before that  was  we explained it  that's an old  morning zoo trick  he laid under  the thing  in the tomb  right  me and boss  didn't know  what was he  if he was just  in a glass box  right  laying there  you know what trick 
[00:58:00]  I'd like to see him  do  I'd like to see him  give Sam alopecia  oh  as much as big  clumpy hair fall out  oh my god  that would fucking  roll  on half his head  what  because you kissed  his ass a little  too much  yeah your eyebrows  fall out  I understand you  don't want to be  haters like us  but  somewhere in between  would be nice  why would I be  mean to him  I'm pulling clips  pull clips  oh david blaine  oh my god  I asked good  questions  I asked about  chris angel  what did he say  about chris angel  did he say  oh he's good  he does his thing  he said 
[00:58:30]  he likes to  there's enough room  for everybody  for a complete  fucking hack  like chris angel  if I had been there  been like chris angel  when you walked  across the water  that was amazing  that would be  a shitty thing  to do  it's so obvious  here's  here's something  from believe  oh okay  where he  levitates  Shaq  Shaquille O'Neal  is there  but he's got all  these people  around him  yeah  to prove  that it happens  the reaction  from these  bad actors 
[00:59:00]  it's a dead  giveaway  that they're  in on  everything  and if you're  doing a web  if you're  doing like a web  series  you're gonna get  some bad actors  because you don't  have a lot of  money  right  but someone like  chris angel  could afford  better actors  to pull this  shit off  for him  he levitates  I remember  Shaq attack  he levitates  him  oh Shaq attack  yes I remember  Shaq attack  he's the genie  from fucking  Kazam  Kazam  that's what it was  this is fucking  he levitated himself 
[00:59:30]  like on a flying  carpet or something  watch this  pull me out  for years  in the press  to levitate him  levitate  levitate me  so I'll do it  if you want to  see it right now  he called you out  in the press  for years  did he  why is that  old white lady  playing basketball  you have to  agree to this  oh alright  let's do it  well he's there  so of course  he agreed to it  already  I want you to  lay down  relax  what the fuck  horrible version  of the fuck  he doesn't want  us to see  this is the  official version  it's on his  website  what  it's a mess 
[01:00:00]  alright  go back  hold on  he's probably  levitating Shaq  see he's floating  oh my god  how fake is that  that's fucking magic  look at the people  pointing and go  oh  that's Carrot Top  he's floating  in midair  that's magic  he's not floating  in the air  look at that  you piece of  garbage  he's magic 
[01:00:30]  Flavor Flav  Flav  Flav is as stupid  as a rock  so  he's  you think it'd be  easy to pull the  wool over  Flavor Flav  he might have  wanted to get  someone a little  more impressive  by the way  the Shaq balloon  because it's  obvious a Shaq  balloon  it started moving  like a balloon  they didn't even  edit that part out  of course it's a  Shaq balloon  you're not even  saying that's Shaq  himself  no  it is Shaq  he's floating  look they have 
[01:01:00]  so much glare  from the sun  on that shot  you can tell  that it's a Shaq  balloon  his face isn't  moving  it's a fake Shaq  no it's not  that's Shaquille O'Neal  he's floating  you piece of garbage  now look  now they just  have him laying  on the ground  and look at all  the people  they're like  wow  but they saw  the whole fucking  camera cut bullshit  he did not  Chip  you're an idiot  Flavor Flavs  is there  how in the world 
[01:01:30]  did Chris Angel  get shot off  the ground  well that's a little  tough for you sir  maybe start with  your ABCs  you can fly babies  over the house  yeah yeah  sure  right into your window  he's the best  illusionist in the world  Chris  you're fucking  amazing  fuck yeah  that's the most  amazing thing  I ever saw  oh my god  these guys have to  fucking do that  for Chris Angel  I'm gonna ask Chris  can I be next  Shaq everybody  you are 
[01:02:00]  you're all the way up there  look they're talking  to each other  in the background  like oh  did you see that  it's all fake  what better way  to celebrate  than what my friends  and family  all here to witness  my attempt  to levitate Shaq  that's right  Shaq balloon  it's obviously  a Shaq balloon  somebody's got  a remote control  go back to it  he's got a long  shirt on  that doesn't  fucking move  that's hilarious  Shaqiel is floating  you know that's  what it was  no I didn't know  it was Shaq balloon 
[01:02:30]  it's such a Shaq balloon  you could tell  they don't show his face  you're gonna be able  to tell in a second  here  the sun is  glimmering  but he used a shot  where he blows it  because it starts  moving like a balloon  it's coming up  right here  see he can't  he can't even pick  he can't even pick  the right shots  in post  to make it look 
[01:03:00]  believable  or is it a green screen  no that's a Shaq balloon  and you can tell  when it's coming  back down  you're right  it's Shaq balloon  that's why they were like  we have to make you  unconscious for this  because you're not  going to be moving  because it's Shaq balloon  right there you can tell  it's a Shaq balloon  and everyone else there  knows it's Shaq balloon  right  except Flavor Flav  Flav's tricked  and then the old  as old as when  yeah  and now he's on the ground  and it's Shaq again  that's like when the  three stooges would  fall off a building  and the dummies  would hit the fucking  ground 
[01:03:30]  and then they'd be  like oh  shake their head  dude in one take  with one camera  yeah  no he didn't  yes he did  I've seen it  Chris Angel is  horrible  he's got a  he's got a huge  oversized t-shirt on  it's not moving  at all  while he's in the air  he's floating  so bad  David Blaine kicks his ass  it's real  no it's not  I think the Shaq balloon  actually though  is clever  I'll give him that much  but I think  we've said it in the past 
[01:04:00]  his presentation  stinks  yeah  it's clever to come up  with the Shaq balloon  Shaq balloon  but there's a better way  to do it  I bet it's behind the house  it's not in front of people  if he's got to do it  and Shaq goes back there  and then Shaq balloon  comes above the roof  and why wouldn't you have  Shaq balloon  just keep going  yeah yeah  really fuck people up  Shaq balloon  it's like we lost  Shaq balloon  oh no Shaq  come back  just a speck  in the sky  way up there  that'd be hilarious  that would be good  and then you find 
[01:04:30]  Shaq deflated  in a river somewhere  they find a deflated Shaq  miles away  stuck in tree branches  on some power line  just in the breeze  I'm a huge fan  of Shaq balloon  I want Shaq balloon  I'm gonna get Shaq balloon  for my kids next birthday party  what happens if Shaq balloon  and hit power chords  while they were filming  he just got  horrified people  Naina would've sang about it  in 1909  Shaq balloon  that'd be a good one  oh god 
[01:05:00]  does Penn stay up late  let's call Penn  and see if he'll  he'll explain Shaq balloon  for us  oh that's  cause then you get  a little fishing wire  or something  and then you get  some balloon operators  right  yeah  it's just  but they blew it  with the one shot  cause you see  the balloon  kinda go  it did the wobble  the balloon wobble  little wobble  but his big  you know  flowing shirt  didn't move at all  through the whole thing  terrible  he's the worst  I bet Penn's got  respect for David Blaine  though  hell no  David Blaine's 
[01:05:30]  a fucking man  Penn understands  this shit  Chris Angel  is a piece of garbage  he's a piece of shit  you're a piece of garbage  here we go  he's magic  you might wanna leave  the room Sam  cause we're gonna  fucking blow up  blow up your pal there  go ahead Cullen  give Sam some reality  right now  alright  go ahead Cullen  nah  alright  Cullen  whatever the fuck  what's your name  Cullen  alright  so  what did I do  wrong  Cullen  we met 
[01:06:00]  no who is this  Chris Angel  or David Blaine  I didn't even know  there was anyone  in the studio  holy  it's Chris Angel  Chris Angel's  in the studio  what's up  no we met  we met you  down in New Orleans  you're doing  Tricks with Quarters  Tricks with Quarters  yes  sure  which one did you like  he's gone  well I'm glad I got  my dose of reality  from that  he was going to say  that there's a whole 
[01:06:30]  crowd around  and I think it was  David  it was David Blaine  and David Blaine  pushed this particular  crowd out to bring  in his own crowd  his own crowd  but obviously this guy's  a fucking idiot  who can't work a phone  he could be  as bad a caller  as Chris Angel  as a magician  I think so  yes  I think so  oh I love  Shaq Balloon though  I'm a huge fan  Shaq Balloon is great  and then you got  a dummy like  Flavor Flav  he'll play the part  nice for you  yeah cause they're  all in on it  they're all in on it  but Flav you could 
[01:07:00]  probably say  Flav look at that bush  look at that bush  Flav  oh damn  look at that  but while he's  looking at the bush  they're switching out  Shaq and the balloon  Shaq's floating  just show him  shiny shit  yeah  yeah boy  look at Shaq  like Flav really  believes the trick  and he was there  yeah yeah  he wasn't acting  yeah okay  but there was a marathon  on last night  and I just kept  going back to it  if I was around the channels  they were trying to compete  with the David Blaine special  by putting on a  Believe marathon  yes  yes  it was so bad  it was like the Super Bowl 
[01:07:30]  everyone in the crowds  that he has around him  for every dumb trick  he does  is in on the  fucking gag  and it's obvious  I mean I can understand  maybe doing one of those  every so often  but it's every trick  all of them  you should study the crowd  and see if  it's the same people  the same people show up  they probably throw  sunglasses on them  and change them around  a little bit  he did another trick  last night  where he had  this woman  this short woman 
[01:08:00]  and a tall guy  and they were standing  like in a  kind of a field  you know  a park  and they had blankets  and they signed  their own arms  so she signs her arm  and he signs his own arm  and they covered themselves  with the blankets  and then David Blaine  pulls the blankets off  and they were  switched  Criss Angel  or David Blaine  Criss Angel  okay Criss Angel  pulled the blankets off  and the woman  and they beat them in soap  yes they should have  ow  ow  ow 
[01:08:30]  and they switched position  but on the guy's arm now  was the woman's signature  whoa that's crazy  and it was  what  all  a camera cut  and it was all  inside a crowd  that he was using  we're calling him out  on his presentation  I hope people understand that  oh I know it's not  real magic  right  but his illusion  isn't an illusion  his presentation's  very lazy  yeah and it's a camera trick  that's all it is  like yeah  anybody could do it 
[01:09:00]  you could do a camera trick  special effect  I hate  I'm not  I'm not sitting there  wondering if  when I watch Jurassic Park  that they got real dinosaurs  and why are they  why do they always have to  cover their shit up  for the magic to work  yeah yeah  that's a good point  cover that up  just call them out  go alright  if you're so  if you're a magician  now do it without  the fucking big huge blanket  yeah  there's gotta be like  some suspension of disbelief  and not for one second  did anybody believe  Shaq Balloon  no one 
[01:09:30]  he floated over to your house  no Chip  I fucking seemed it  I think the trick itself  is pretty smart  doing Shaq Balloon  Shaq Balloon  but it just  there had to be a better way  to pull it off  it's obvious you need  the audience in on it though  yeah when you gotta  have Shaq leave the frame  and then replace him  with a balloon  right  your trick is  how awkward is that  when Chris Angel  walks in with the Shaq Balloon  to start his illusion  blowing it up  right  blowing it up  behind the house  that has to awkwardly 
[01:10:00]  come out with it  he's red faced  and then he has to  talk to the crowd  okay so now  where we're at  and the trick is  Shaq obviously  is now in the house  chilling out  and now  we have Shaq Balloon  this is gonna look  great on TV  just be amazed  by the Shaq Balloon  could you do that  people  just be amazed  it's got that jersey thing  going  it's Long Island  first  Long Island  same thing  it's a Long Island  slash speech impediment  thing happening  now I'm gonna pull out  Shaq Balloon 
[01:10:30]  and it's gonna float  over the house  I want everyone  to go fuffer  and fuck a tash  guys I need you  to bear with me  for one more second  bear with me  can we see Shaq Balloon  take off again  the Shaq Balloon  the Shaq Balloon popped  you wanna see Shaq Balloon again  just cause now  that we all  are in  let's watch him  take off  I just wanna see  where Shaq Balloon  takes off  I wanna see  Shaq Balloon  take off too  oh this is the 
[01:11:00]  commercial for Shaq Balloon  it's right  world of magic  but if I could do  anything greater than that  that would be  something to see  I've known Shaq  for suss  he said  I want Chris Angel  to make me float  I challenge Chris  makes him float  so we're gonna put  that together  Shaq float  just done with chocolate  ice cream  this is something  that we can really  bring to life  Shaq Balloon  why did everyone  have to rub their  hands together  it's magic  that's a different crowd  yes  there were kids there 
[01:11:30]  that was take one  oh Christ  he is the worst  the kids popped the Shaq Balloon  I was tugging my willy  while everybody clapped  levitate the head of my penis  yeah levitate my jizz  you heinie  cause children love balloons  yeah yeah  that's why he brought  the children in  they're like  look kids  a Shaq Balloon  they're like  oh  and they just  use that reaction  is there any shots  really of the balloon  and the audio crowd  together  is it possible  that those were  shot separately  maybe  no possibly  that's why  I want to see  Shaq Balloon  take off again 
[01:12:00]  Shaq has been  calling me out  for years  for years  for years  Shaq's on the ground  go full screen  relax  relax  alright  so now everyone  is touching  everyone's around Shaq  touching Shaq  to get him some take  where's the kids  there aren't kids  it's a different crowd  start to lift up  now  alright now that's  Shaq Ballone  yeah now that's  Shaq Ballone  don't release your  hand jack  yeah because he  see the guy on the  left can't help  himself  he knows it's  Shaq Ballone 
[01:12:30]  the guy in the  black t-shirt  why would you  look amazing  oh  pause  we are gonna  break this down  why wouldn't you  as Criss Angel  and his production  staff go alright  that guy is  fucking laughing  at Shaq Ballone  let me see him laugh  we gotta get rid  of that guy  it's subtle  but it's the guy  on the left  the guy on the  left  the guy on the  right is doing  a really bad  acting job  of looking too  surprised  yeah he's very  surprised  and then the guy  on the left  couldn't look less  surprised  like of course  Shaq Ballone  is racing  because he  realizes as 
[01:13:00]  they're doing it  how ridiculous  this is  and he can't  help himself  look at him  laughing  he's laughing  see if Shaq  oh my god  he's laughing  if Shaq was  levitating  and obviously  you want to  make this  believable  for the audience  you wouldn't  have a guy  laughing  you'd have  guys like  what the fuck  and why is  Carrot Top  involved in this  fat Carrot Top  I guess  no that's  actual Carrot Top  that's really  Carrot Top  oh they got  Carrot Top  yeah  he's just his  boy I guess  because they  hang out in Vegas  I guess they  give you know  it's quid pro quo  why does he have  a frumpy butt  I thought he's 
[01:13:30]  a workout guy  he is  that's why he's  got his  Carrot Crew  t-shirt on  Carrot Crew  Carrot Crew  ugh  going to see  Shaq Balloon  float  go back to  Laughing Guy  though  you would have  to get rid  of Laughing Guy  and look at  this fucking  idiot with  the chain  wallet thing  yeah  look at  he's over  doing it  whoa  and you know  Criss Angel  had to tell him  beforehand  look raise it  all at the  same time  you gotta keep  Shaq Balloon  level or people  will know  that he's a  balloon 
[01:14:00]  no Shaq Balloon  has helium  in it  yeah yeah  so they don't  even have to  do anything  but that's  just it  they all have  to just  kind of  if one guy  raises too  quickly  Shaq Balloon's  feet would go  up  well let's  see if they  fucked that  up too  you think  Chris was  looking at  this like  is this  the best  take  is this  the best  take  we have  where's  the kids  they weren't  really there  that was a  different take  he made  them disappear  it's more  magic  I bet you  because they  tried it  with the  kids and  they couldn't  get the  right  reaction  so like  alright  we gotta  get the  balloon  I want 
[01:14:30]  Shaq Balloon  right  alright go  back to  Shaq Balloon  get ready  to pause  it though  okay  alright  here we go  so then you  got laughing  guy on the  left  he's like  this is  so stupid  it's breathing  that's  Chris Angel  breathing  alright now  why they cut  the Flavin  because the  balloon  wasn't stable  you could see  that it was  moving to the  left too much  and now you  need  so they went  for the  cut  the strings  or whatever  the fuck  is controlling 
[01:15:00]  Shaq Balloon  right  I bet there's  some kind of  remote control  on it  you think  it's remote  control Shaq  Balloon  like one of  those remote  control blimps  dude that  would rule  yeah  that's a possibility  there'd be Shaq  Balloon propellers  but you never  see his head  so he probably  has a propeller  on his head  probably  he's wearing  one of those  old beanies  right  because you never  really see Shaq's  head  no  not completely  and there's a lot  of sun glare  and lens flare  stuff  which is smart  they shot it  into the sun  which is 
[01:15:30]  everyone knows  you don't do that  you don't do that  so he could  obviously film  Shaq  levitating  from the other  angle  look at the guy  on the left  is so amazed  he's making  Bowser face  look right there  in the background  it gives it away  you can see  there's a little  truck on the side  it says  balloon truck  I'll bet they  I'll bet they  didn't let  Flava play  in on it  they just kept  him away  from the crowd  oh yeah  yeah  they knew  they could get  something from him  he actually is  amazed  he's got  fucking dope  alright let's  watch Shaq  balloon float 
[01:16:00]  how does he  remember to  breathe  Chris Angel  Chris Angel's  right under  Shaq balloon  now  alright let's  go  but they  they don't  stay on  they don't  stay on  it long  enough  for you  to  you saw  the waving  of the waves  there  right  yes  and then  it's  into the sun  and now  Shaq balloon  is blowing  away  over the house 
[01:16:30]  then again  hold on a  second  see that's  where you can  totally tell  it's a balloon  he wobbles  because he's  too close to  the roof  now he's  going on the  other side  of the house  so maybe  by the time  all the people  get there  they're able  to do the  switcheroo  to have the  Shaq  something about  can you go  back a little  bit  it looks like  his ass  is almost  flat  on that one  like he's  sitting on  something  because it's  hard to make  a Shaq balloon  you can't make  it perfect  it almost looks 
[01:17:00]  like he's  laying on  something  oh like a  green screen  yeah yeah  that's why  I'm going  Shaq balloon  all the way  oh I see  what you're  saying here  yeah it looks  really  like he's  laying on  something  but you know  what they  probably did  that's Shaq  balloon  that's probably  real pants  and they  asfixed it  to Shaq balloon  like they  like they  tasted  they dressed  Shaq balloon  yeah you have  to dress  Shaq balloon  so Shaq  doesn't have  an ass  so Shaq  has to come  there with  two you know  two sets of 
[01:17:30]  clothing  and the ass  is probably  like velcroed  to the balloon  right  oh okay maybe  that's it  yeah because  yeah  Shaq balloon  is just a shell  and then you got  a dress Shaq balloon  hello Chris  it's Shaq  what's Shaq balloon  wearing  I gotta wear  the same thing  as Shaq balloon  I got my  Nikes  what kind  of jeans  are them  Levi's  what's the  sweater  Shaq balloon  wearing today  we got 
[01:18:00]  someone  that's  going to  explain  Shaq balloon  yes  go ahead  sir  now you guys  are you going to  explain it  Bobo  explain Shaq  balloon  Bobo  you guys woke  me up  what  we're on the radio 
[01:18:30]  we're on the radio  doing our show  yeah I know that  but I gotta  Shaq  how does Shaq  balloon work  yeah  contribute  how does Shaq  balloon work  we're in the middle  of talking about  Shaq balloons  what do you got  oh I know  it's a giant balloon  looks like  so they got  the  the evening  in a parade  and that's  oh it's like  like Snoopy balloon  they have like  an army of people  with the strings  below Shaq  fucking pulling  Shaq along  walking him around  the cat in the hat  is right behind him  floating  hit some fucking 
[01:19:00]  lamppost  and knock a lady  oh shit  what's Chris Angel's  twitter  hack  I wanna ask him  if Shaq balloons  gonna be in the  Macy's Day parade  this year  that is a good one  the Thanksgiving  day  parade  alright I guess  you'd have nothing  Bobo  that's a surprise  usually you're pretty good  yeah you guys  you guys just woke me up  I don't know what  you're talking about  we're on the radio  we're doing a show  99 Shaq balloons  Shaq balloons  what's his twitter  Chris Angel  C-R-I-S-S 
[01:19:30]  C-R-I-S-S  yeah just kind of  a little more magic  a little more crazy  A-N-G-E-L  that's it  I love him  you love Chris Angel  thank you  alright let's go back  to Shaq balloons  now we're at the  top of the house  going over the top  of the house  and they fucked it up  they should have got  rid of that shot  or did it again  because you totally  see the balloon  he wavers a little  and the flat ass  and the flat ass  because you know  you got Shaq's jeans  that you had a velcro  onto the Shaq balloon  right  because the balloon people  are going to be like  look we can make something  that looks like him 
[01:20:00]  but then you're going  to have to dress it  yeah  it's wobbling  it was going back and forth  like a teeter totter  right  then he goes on  the other side of the house  look at his feet  are going like  wah wah wah  and the crowd is so  the sound is just  edited in  it's fake  yeah man  oh the people are amazed  Shaq balloon's coming back down 
[01:20:30]  well  he could have had  another group of people  that just see Shaq balloon  you know  levitating above the house  look at his face  not moving  the second you have  Shaq balloon  in front of all those people  you know they're all in on it  yeah  because it's Shaq balloon  all you have to do  is study the crowd  they all look like  Criss Angel  because they're like  aunts, uncles, nephews  nieces  yeah  Shaq balloon  alright let's  if Shaq balloon was  if Shaq was flying around 
[01:21:00]  the Las Vegas skies  yeah  probably would have made  a news broadcast  you'd think  you'd think  we're not going to question  that's an illusion  it's just once again  the presentation  would have been a  stinks  a UFN report  oh that was brilliant  thank you  he wouldn't have been  unidentified  no 
[01:21:30]  maybe not  oh he's back down  I had the craziest dream  I was a balloon  could you  could you do me a favor  could you do me a favor  could you  could you back it up  to the point  where Shaq balloon  was hovering  I love that we're just saying  Shaq balloon  was hovering just about 
[01:22:00]  at the garage door height  because  I just have to see something  very quickly  I want to confirm something  okay  alright  something new  yeah  oh nice  I still think green screen  but  no way  Shaq balloon  all the way  his feet look a little weird  against the blue sky there  but I'm just saying  okay  I know it's hard to tell  yeah  but doesn't he have tattoos  it is hard  I would  you know what I would do  I would freeze that shot 
[01:22:30]  put it in Photoshop  and boost some of the  fucking levels on it  I think it's  I'll tell you why  it's not a green screen  because his body  doesn't move an inch  yeah  and if they were using  a green screen  hopefully smart enough  to say  hey Shaq  you need to move  just slightly  so it looks like  it's a real body  something  yeah but it might be  as stiff as possible  here's why they might have  kept him still  because it's harder  on the green screen  the stiller he is  the easier it is  to make a convincing  move  yeah  something tells me  that it's just 
[01:23:00]  it's just a green screen  that seems like  a more controllable thing  don't blow up our party  it's a shock  I think it's Shaq Balloon  it's Shaq Balloon  the wavering over the roof  has me convinced  and the Velcro ass  yeah yeah yeah  Velcro ass is him  laying on some glass  but Ian wants to see something  what are you looking at  I was looking at his beard  and he does indeed  have the beard there  it looked like  at one shot  he didn't have  Shaq Balloon  didn't have a beard  alright let's see  but they put a beard  on Shaq Balloon  yeah Shaq Balloon  yeah you're not  going to make that mistake  no no  and it's just 
[01:23:30]  very quickly cut  see  that's the other thing  because  hold on  because a balloon  is not going to stay  steady enough  so they're just  finding quick seconds  where the balloon  is steady  because it  just when you  want to see more of it  they always cut away  they cut away  which goes against  producing something  and they won't show him  hitting the ground  no  because the balloon  would bounce off  it would go  boom boom boom boom  it's so a balloon  when they go back  to his shot  his shoulders are up  and he just puts  his shoulders and head back 
[01:24:00]  here comes Shaquille O'Neal  coming into Lakehurst, New Jersey  what a lovely day  to bring Shaq in  Shaq is now  they've thrown down  the control cables  people are getting it up  the big boomers out there  to get  oh no  Shaq's exploded  oh no  get out of the way  get out of the way  oh the humanity  we got a guy  that's going to explain the trick  Shaq balloon  I hope so  are you going to explain 
[01:24:30]  Shaq balloon  Shaq balloon  hey guys  how you doing  yeah  I'm an amateur magician  I've actually done a  similar trick like this before  and actually  fucking amateur  let me make you feel at home  ta-da  presto  you'll roll it  abracadabra  go ahead  oh sorry guys  you guys are embarrassing me  oh  it's just  black people  float  and that's why  the trick works so well  oh  right  what'd you say dude  you're falling crapped out 
[01:25:00]  let's go  okay  oh  nice  it's trying to be  coke floats in  E-Rux cup  true  that floats  fucking Shaq balloon  fucking Shaq balloon  let's come down to this  yeah I want a Shaq  we should get a Shaq balloon  for the studio  let's get a Jim Norton balloon  I would love that  so would everyone  they would just touch it  who makes these  fucking things  I guess  Chris Angel  Chris Angel  and Carrot Top  yeah  Carrot Top helps him  with his props 
[01:25:30]  yeah that's why  Carrot Top's there  he's like  hey man  I know a balloon guy  but would you mind  I would like to be  part of the illusion  so do you think  that it was  Chris Angel balloon  when he levitated  above the Luxor  yeah  was that Chris Angel balloon  is all of his  levitation tricks now  people balloons  wait  let's go to that one  go to Chris Angel  levitating above the Luxor  we know a lot about  this Chris Angel guy  do you think it's a combination  of maybe a balloon  and green screen  maybe at one point  they couldn't do the balloon  so they used green screen  no  I'm going strictly 
[01:26:00]  with balloon  I bet  I'll bet  Carrot Top had a joke  about Shaq balloon  and the joke  didn't work  and he was like  hey Chris Angel  I got this Shaq balloon  I think you can do  something with it  maybe you can do  something with it  that's pretty funny  yeah  oh they got the Shaq balloon  from Ted's  Celebrity Balloon Emporium  I didn't know that  thank you Arden PA  now there is  Chris Angel  high above  the Luxor  but his arms are 
[01:26:30]  and look at the light  the way the light's  all fucking wild  no he's on a wire  he's standing  it's hard to tell  because you know  they made sure  oh yeah  he's moving his arms  his arms are moving  like he's flying  but I mean  obviously  he's on  some kind of cables  with a helicopter  and you see  more people laughing  yeah  by the way  how stupid this is  there's a heli 
[01:27:00]  and then they cut him  off  I'd be scared  there's a helicopter  right  that's filming the thing  that's probably the  or  how many bugs  must be around that light  oh yeah  like moth central  he's not moving up and down  and his feet are staying  hey what's that  looking out over the strip  is the culmination  of a lifetime stream  that's come to fruition  yeah  he's probably just  on a plexiglass platform  you can see  he's doing something 
[01:27:30]  right  yeah  because why isn't he  moving his legs  he's only moving his arms  yeah  if you're floating  you don't give a fuck  you would move your legs around  and that's where  there's that light beam  coming from the thing  so you can't see  that there's a plexiglass  hole  that's always there  no that's why  I picked this spot  but how do you think  he got stood up on that  well that's his  you know  that's his illusion  yeah and he's probably  got a mechanism  the cables  the cables probably go up  through his pant legs  through a harness  out his shoulders 
[01:28:00]  yeah  you know  so he's standing  on something  he's being braced  and he probably raises up  from the top of the top  right  but why would no one  see that and go  hey  they do  a lot of times  they do  and there's a lot  of times  you know what else  he uses  I heard  when it's a real audience  and not a plant  they do things  when the crowd  is around  like alright  ladies and gentlemen  check this out  before Criss Angel  comes out  and then they'll  do a fireworks display  and they'll get people  looking going like  oh 
[01:28:30]  or they'll have  some kind of  other thing  that's a big attraction  well some of that  stuff's smart  and they go  oh  and then they use  those clips  to be like  holy shit  yeah  but the other thing  too  if you see any guy  just on wires  above a building  you're pretty impressed  by that alone  you're like  holy fuck  that's crazy  yes  right  yes  so you don't even really  yeah yeah  you almost don't even  need the illusion part  because you're just  amazed that someone  would be crazy enough  to even just be up there  with wires  or fucking helicopter 
[01:29:00]  or hanging from a helicopter  or whatever the fuck  right  fucking Tony Montana  is down there pointing up  I never trusted him  yeah  Chris Angel's okay  he fucking looking  like where he looked  where fucking  Omar used to be  this all started  with the Rob Ford  Matt Lauer clip  and we went  off-roading  so  after the break  we'll get back  to the Rob Ford  clip of the day  with Matt Lauer  okay  look at his  floating over the house  video  classic crane work  and everyone was in on it  Dr. Steve  what do you mean crane work 
[01:29:30]  Chris Angel is known  to use cranes too  and people around him  miraculously don't see them  when they film  literally a crane  that picks people up  you know it's got like a wire  and they have a harness  no man because  well I'm just saying  it's still Shaq  Shaq would have moved  a little bit  or his body would have  been moving a little bit  yes  even if he's supposedly  under some spell  oh  the muscles would still  be floaty  yeah  exactly  what 
[01:30:00]  this is a funny video  oh shit  why  woman not happy  with Chris Angel's  botched trick  oh cool  let's see this  and then you get  like you gotta listen  to all the people's  reactions after it too  uh huh  what is he trying to do  so he's got  six swords  are we putting all these  clips on our  Facebook page  E-Rock  so it's not as visual  yes  alright  this is one he did  last night I believe  I saw on  I saw on the marathon  and I guess  the sixth one  is supposed to be  controlled by an  audience member  uh huh 
[01:30:30]  now in this clip  the audience member  pulls the rope  and of course  nothing happens  of course  because it's not  uh oh  it's not controlling  the sword actually  oh boy  oh no  oh no  oh that's embarrassing  oh no  oh no  oh no 
[01:31:00]  can we pull the line  can we pull the line  see what did I tell you  is you have to figure it out  it's not easy  it's not an easy act  my grandkids left  because they got a shitty performance  what did she say  she said my grandkids left  because they got a shitty performance  she looks like she's on meth  yes  my grandkids left  for fucking three hours  I call it bullshit  it looks like they're  it looks like they're 
[01:31:30]  trying to shoot  everybody being excited  about the conclusion  and I've been here all my life  and  it looks a little contrived  it looks a little contrived  I wouldn't pay $95 to see them  but this is a crappy  pull  fuck that  if we all scream really loud  we get to be in the TV show  oh man  I'm so impressed  take three  oh and that would have 
[01:32:00]  went right through his chest  he was on that table  and the swords were falling  around him individually  someone would pull the cord  and the sword would fall  and it was very dramatic  and then he gets up  and that's the last one  and that's the one that falls  and would have killed him  did they show the part  where he pulled it  and then nothing happened  you know what  I was getting up and down  for like a beer or something  so maybe I missed that part  have you seen that  where's that trick in completion 
[01:32:30]  on last  on the  believe  it was  oh is it this one  yes  that's the one  that's the trick  oh that's so embarrassing  that's funny  it's like  oh look it is  it's the same trick  put your finger  on number one  got it  yeah why would you think  people wouldn't film this  pull it and drop it on the ground  Barbara put your finger  on number two  haha she puts it on 
[01:33:00]  big lump of shit  Barbara  yes  pull number two  now  it's so fucking fake  they're not  the ropes aren't actually  connected to swords at all  no  no  no  that's what happened  they don't want to  take a chance  they're not going to listen  it doesn't  it's really scary  Barbara's pretty  haha  Barbara put your finger  on number four  as we do this 
[01:33:30]  the odds get more  in the favor  of you getting stabbed  no they don't  more  in the favor  more in the favor  Barbara there are  two swords above me  there's five and six  I want you to take your finger  and I want you just to touch  the top of the pin of five  got it  now touch six  got it  listen to your inner voice  I trust you Barbara 
[01:34:00]  do you believe in fate  yes I do  you can change your mind  what are you feeling  five or six  Barbara  I feel six  okay  six  yes  you really feel that  Barbara  oh god  fuck it's suspense  I'm gonna have to go  with you Barbara  take your hand off  five  take it  oh  she inadvertently  pulled it  what the fuck 
[01:34:30]  kind of horse shit  now he gets off the table  right  and this is the last one  this is where it fucked up  that sucks  they didn't show the lady  no  they didn't show the guy  who said anything  who said I think if you clap  you'll be able to get on  the TV show  you make a lot of noise  you could get on the TV show  what about the part where it didn't work  they should leave that in the show  yeah  where she pulls  and then nothing happens 
[01:35:00]  oh my god  it's all just  fucking bad  and now  again  I understand these are illusions  there's not real magic  I'm not that stupid  but  it's supposed to be like  something people  that was the amazing thing  about watching a magician  is you could not figure out  what was being done  and it was clever  and stuff  he's using bad camera tricks  and just  and balloons  and balloons  and Shaq's balloon  if you watch it on TV  you're supposed to believe  that the audience watching it  yeah 
[01:35:30]  is also being tricked  like it's supposed to be like  if I was there live  it would be just as amazing  that's supposed to lend it credibility  is that there's a live audience watching  they're there  as your proxy  to watch this  and meanwhile  they're all in on it  and you can tell by the bad act  they're barely  they're barely in it  let's say hi to Eric in New York  Eric  love you love your show  it's the man cow thing  come on guys  we don't love ourselves  I didn't hear what you said dude  that means shit to us  come up Jimmy  the 
[01:36:00]  the levitational  thing is a hologram  apparently  he's not even there  what  alright well  it goes back to a point  about the presentation thing  if it's a hologram  then you wiggle  your feet around  yeah do something  his feet are so stiff  that's what fucks up  that trick  flap your arms  like a boy  because if you're  if you're  what  go ahead  go ahead  nah don't matter  flap your arms  like a bird  but why wouldn't you be  moving your legs too  because if you're floating  you don't give a fuck  make it like you're swimming  right  yeah leave  I'm friends with Fast Eddie 
[01:36:30]  isn't that your buddy  yeah he's really good  with sleight of hand  he's a magician  he's very good  at sleight of hand  and he gets really frustrated  with these guys  because he knows  that a lot of these tricks  are hack  that a lot of guys  could do  but Fast Eddie  to be kind  is not a handsome man  is that what it takes  you gotta be a handsome man  and then you throw  some hack tricks  and then you're loud  on TV  he looks like  Rizzo the mechanic  from Mesh  right  oh shit  that's very funny 
[01:37:00]  and if he was  a true magician  he would grow  his own hair  instead of fucking  wearing a dead animal  on his head  maybe he hides  everything under there  he takes his wig off  at night  and his deck of cards  are wrapping  those rings  that are hooked together  a shack balloon  a shack balloon  under his wig  but I love the guy  of course  alright thank you  that's all you gotta say  are we convinced now  that Criss Angel  is possibly  the worst magician  that was ever  fucking magicianing  it's strange  because he comes up 
[01:37:30]  with clever stuff  and newer stuff  but it's easy  to come up  with clever stuff  but the balloon trick  would be really  fucking cool  but he just  doesn't pull it off  right  oh god  because they're all  obviously illusions  in the end  like Penn and Teller  you're not gonna  sit there  30 seconds into a trick  and go  oh they're using a balloon  right  you know what I mean  you're gonna go home  scratching your fucking  head for days  going how the fuck  did he  and he explains how  he takes years  on tricks  yeah yeah 
[01:38:00]  he does it all  of a sudden  like I bet you  Criss Angel went  oh fuck  shack balloon  balloons  and then goes  let's tape it  next weekend  like if that was  Penn and Teller  they would probably  work the shack balloon  for a year  yeah yeah  at least  but that's the art  is coming up  with an idea  and then creating  this thing  where you're convincing  people that it  could be real  and that takes  a really long time  you have to stand  in the pentagram  oh god  chip believes it all 
[01:38:30]  but David Blaine  is good at this  shit  close up magic  is pretty amazing  guys  that can do  sleight of hand  sleight of hand  is amazing  and he's the  fucking man at that  yeah but I just  know a lot of those  tricks are done  by a lot of guys  a lot of guys  he's really good  at it though  yeah he's a  fucking man  his sleight of hand  is pretty impressive  yes  you watched him  we're going to do  the Rob Ford clip  after the break  well Chris Angel  is actually going to  is everyone going  to see him  when he's here  when is he here  well he's here 
[01:39:00]  hold on kids  here it comes  it's the big  Chris Angel magic show  yeah where  it's odd place  he's going to be  at the Garden State  Comedy Club  at the Holiday Inn  this Friday and Saturday  let's hope he can  make an audience appear  where's that  it's in  oh I don't know  Garden State  it's in Clinton  Jersey  yeah  okay  go to Jim Norton  dot com  for your fucking  ticket links  that's true  Fishman here  makes a good point  with David Blaine  he does the magic  in front of black people 
[01:39:30]  because he knows  it's hilarious  because they  lose their minds  yeah  and Who Kid  has confirmed  that black people  are afraid of magic  he said  and Who Kid  said David Blaine  is the devil  that's the one  thing that's disappointing  David Blaine  would not come clean  about the fact  that you go to  black people  because they're  funny  they lose  their minds  at that fucking  sleight of hand magic  he said  you can't  generalize an audience  that every  and I go  come on  he's like  now look at your card  and they look  and it's like  oh shit  they run away 
[01:40:00]  they run away  from the magic  wait you asked him  that question  I did ask him  oh good for you  you are like  a fucking  investigative journalist  he's Matt Lousey  Matt Lousey  there's a potential  for a compliment  alright we're gonna  break Rob Ford  talking about Lauer  he's a bit  rough around the edges  this Rob Ford  and also  the Bob Dylan thing  I guess we could  talk about 
[01:40:30]  but it's more  of a visual  if you're interested  and then we got  the family feud clip  which is terrific  the O.B. Anthony Show  on Sirius XM  see  told you we had sponsors  and now  back to  the O.B. Anthony Show  alright we're gonna move on  but me and Anne are discussing  Shaq Balloon  and we just figured out  another one  when Shaq Balloon  finally  touches back down  to earth  the final shot  is Shaq 
[01:41:00]  moving his head  where his chin  is in his chest  and then  Shaq's head  moves backwards  to land on the ground  as well  even though his body  is already on the ground  yeah Chris Angel  is kind of like  looking like  he's laying Shaq  gently down  on the ground  and the only way  to kind of show that  with the real Shaq  laying on the ground  is the only part  like his head  kind of drifts  back down  to the ground  because the rest of his body  is already on the ground  because it's the real Shaq now 
[01:41:30]  of course you gotta switch out  the Shaq Balloon  but when he's floating  his head is not in the up position  it's stiff as all hell  plus the fact he's in a trance  so Shaq would never move  his fucking head at all  no  god he stinks  at presentation  yeah watch this  watch  how do you fuck up Shaq Balloon  it's gonna make you laugh Sam  because remember  he's in a trance  his head would never move  like that  no  and then he looks around  like oh I'm on the ground  what would happen 
[01:42:00]  what happened  he's  he's stiff as a board  right  he's stiff as a board  and his head's not in the up position  no he would just land  land flat  right  and you know  and he wasn't a balloon  I mean  yeah  and he's in a trance  so his head wouldn't move  at all  like that  gently  yeah  so get me up here guys  get me up  what happened  alright we'll finally move on  go back to Rob Ford 
[01:42:30]  in the Matt Lauer interview  you can start from the beginning  because that was an hour ago already  this is your Rob Ford clip of the day  where were we on this  I guess we're gonna have to go all the way back  what was he talking about  Matt had  he said he disgraced the office  yeah  alright okay  let's hit this  you said as we were sitting down here  so what happened in city council chambers  this is unprecedented  it's never happened before  what went on in there  they basically  took away  383,000 people  who voted for me 
[01:43:00]  their rights  you have brought disgrace to this office  and you know that's true  I'm embarrassed  not just myself  my family  my friends  my supporters  the whole city  I take full responsibility for that  we've all made mistakes  Matt  I'm not perfect  maybe you are  maybe other people are  wow nice  that's right  I've made mistakes  I admitted to my mistakes  when the questions began to circulate  around you Mr. Mayor  and people started to ask you  about the use of crack cocaine 
[01:43:30]  you played a game of semantics  they asked you  were you a crack addict  according to you  and you said no  I'm not  and they said  do you use crack cocaine  no I don't use crack cocaine  I don't  have I tried crack cocaine  yes I've tried  that's a game of semantics  the best excuse I heard you give  for using that crack cocaine  was I was in a drunken stupor  and I'm wondering  is that supposed to make anybody feel better  no not at all  but show me the video  even according 
[01:44:00]  what does the video matter  because I want to see it  because according  I can't even remember it  I was very  very inebriated  I'm just going to make sure we all understand  you're not in any alcohol treatment program  no  I'm not in alcohol treatment  drug treatment program  I have a weight issue  I've been training every day  all I can say  Matt  action speaks thousand words  I invite you to come back  give me five  give me five or six months  and if you don't see a difference  I'll eat my word  it's very simple  show me any man 
[01:44:30]  eat my hat  wait a second  that has done what he has done  he saved the taxpayers  a billion dollars  councilman  I would expect you  to sit here and defend your brother  I'm telling you facts  I know  I think it's loyal  and I think it's wonderful  I'm telling you facts  have you ever been worried about him  yeah  his weight issues  when he goes on a binge  when he goes on a binge  if you want to call it  a binge drinking  and I hear about it  yeah it's concerning  binge drinking  I know  on a personal side  has Rob been 100% honest 
[01:45:00]  no he hasn't  your brother brings up  something interesting  Mr. Mayor  because you say  he says you go out on a weekend  and you maybe go on a little binge  every once in a while  not every weekend  not every weekend  maybe I said every once in a while  let's retract that  the wrong word  he goes let's retract that  oh I shouldn't have said binge  I shouldn't have said binge  oh boy  is his dumb  that was a great question  by that  yes yes  he's a very good interviewer  yeah I'll say that  I said your brother said  you go out on a weekend  you may go on a binge  every once in a while 
[01:45:30]  not every weekend  absolutely  let's say you go on  one of those binges  and the phone rings in your office  at 3 a.m. on a Saturday night  and something terrible is happening  in the city of Toronto  terrorist attack  some other kind of disaster  are you equipped  will you be capable  and stable enough to handle it  I'm very fortunate  that hasn't happened  it's very few isolated incidents  that's happened  and you're absolutely right  I'm very fortunate  that hasn't happened  but that could happen  with anybody at any time  say you were gone out  drinking  or you were drunk  and say something happened 
[01:46:00]  to your family  hold on  the lives of a million people  aren't resting on my decisions  hold on  say your son or daughter  just got killed  in a car accident  you're plastered  out of your mind  at 3 in the morning  are you going to be able  to handle that  I would take personal  responsibility for my family  you've got taxpayers  and residents of this city  depending on you  and I take personal  responsibility for them too  do you still want this job  absolutely  October 27th  let the people decide  what if they say  we want another guy  like Rob Ford  when it comes to 
[01:46:30]  the fiscal responsibility  but we want a guy  who's going to elevate  the office  and not bring  the baggage  that Mayor Ford brought  find another Rob Ford  that's for sure  yeah  wow  that was a good job  by Matt  Jesus  really good job  by Matt Lauer  I like his little scenario  there  wow  brutal scenario  throwback at the interviewer  you're plastered  out of your mind  what a terrible thing though  what if your kids died  what  Jesus Christ  we're all having fun here

[01:50:00]  Larry Flint's fighting it  but I don't know why  he explained why  oh yeah  that's what a fatso Zimmerman is  look at his bitch  I guess he's dead  railing  oh good  he was just put to death  good good  oh when  this came out 11 minutes ago  what  wow  he was executed  you're exclusive right there  he might have got to stay  for a few hours  or whatever  you're talking about  Joseph Paul Franklin  the white supremacist  convicted of 8 murders  suspected in as many as 20  and who shot  hustler publisher  Larry Flint  yes he was put to death  they shot him over the 
[01:50:30]  interracial sex thing  that was why Larry Flint  was shot  not for being a pornographer  no it'd be well  because he showed  the interracial sex  right  what a piece of garbage  this guy is  he's glad they killed  so he's done  minutes ago  wow  goodbye  what did they give him  the old blue fluid  they should have let black guys  fuck his mouth and ass  oh man  why should he go out  having fun  holy shit  someone else died  that's close to our hearts  you kidding 
[01:51:00]  remember  Elmer  Fudd  there's Elmer Fudd  and there's also  oh no  Elmer  gay Elmer  Gus and Elmer  well as I recall  Gus  had expired  a while ago  Gus died last year  I believe  oh okay  so what's Elmer  supposed to do  come on  and Elmer  never  never recovered  of course  from losing his  lava  of over 60 years  gay is for the young 
[01:51:30]  my friends  for his lava  so Elmer Lockins  symbol of same-sex marriage  dies at 94  94  you can't really  get a lot of radio  on Gus and Elmer  over the years  yes  can't really get out  on the dance floor  at 94  look for some new guy  just out there  dancing around  he could have probably  got a new guy though  because he's famous  in the cause  you think  somebody would have  fucking taken his load  yeah  oh god  there's nothing left  no  nothing left 
[01:52:00]  there's loads to be  even taken at age 94  when he comes  his dick hole  just opens up  and goes  gurgle gurgle  there's a  what's the history  on these two  as far as  what do they do  they got together  they go to war  Elmer and Gus  kept their relationship  private for nearly 60 years  some knew  some just wondered  most did not  discuss the situation  what do they think  was happening  Uncle Gus  and Uncle Elmer  their family  called them  oh boy  families are dumb  I don't know  what's going on 
[01:52:30]  families are so stupid  what do you think's  happening  if you've got a friend  that's over 20 years old  you're pretty much  you're fucking them  especially if they're  coming over every  Thanksgiving together  I mean come on  alright  so it has to be a friend  that's over  a 20 year friendship  plus you bring them  to a family event  year after year  okay  there's no mystery  mystery there  then when they were  both in their 80s  after a lifetime  of refraining from  even holding hands  in public  they embraced 
[01:53:00]  in front of their  family for the first  time  it was November  2003  and they just  got married in Canada  having traveled there  from their home  in Manhattan  Manhattan  so we've been  talking about these  guys since 2003  wow  really  they had to go  to Canada  to get married  2003  yeah  sure  well you know  did they  did they go to  were they like  in the army  or some shit  I think so  yeah  jeez  let me see  we know how it is  in this  great and free nation 
[01:53:30]  you go and fight  for your country  and then come back  and get treated  like shit  don't ask  don't tell  that's great  old lemon party  motherfuckers  you gotta love it  when  when  let's see  Gus died  they were married  nine years at that point  Gus died last year  but they had been  together since that  September day  in 1945  ah  when they met by  chance  in Columbus Circle  oh boy  wow  which is very close 
[01:54:00]  to here  1945  1945  what  what month  they say  September  September  okay  that's  post-war  I had never  seen anything  so handsome  right after  Elmer said  to the New York  Times in 2003  that's a long time  holy mother  Elmer eventually  moved into the house  in Washington Heights  that Gus shared  with his nine siblings  wow  so they were in the  house together  for all those years  and no one was 
[01:54:30]  questioning  well for how many  years  nine kids  what are the odds  you're gonna have one  you know  that's gonna  Gus's parents had died  and he and his sister  were helping raise  their brothers  and sisters  Elmer had his own  room  oh boy  how many nights  hey  pst  Elmer  everyone's asleep  Elmer  Elmer  you there  Elmer  open the door  I've come to visit  comes in with that  fucking  that stocking cap on  with one of those 
[01:55:00]  candle holder things  he blows it out  and Elmer sits on it  oh what a scene  oh yeah  he uses his ass  like those fucking  those candle sniffers  where they fucking  put him out  let me get the light  Elmer  oh god 
[01:55:30]  shit  well they  they did serve  in World War II  oh they did  okay  saw combat in the  South Pacific  oh wow  okay  the theater  fight the Japs  the Pacific Theater  of Operations  wow  that's very impressive  obviously  and they were  discharged in  June of 1945  June of 45  June of 45  and they met 
[01:56:00]  in September  three months later  they didn't  they were out of it  before the official  end of the war  all right  that's how they  got together  let's play Pearl Harbor  I'll lay on my back  and you come and  blow the shit out of me  that old gag  it's still a good one  I love it  it's good every time  what a romantic story  so now we've lost  Gus 
[01:56:30]  or Elmer  like Elmer  I guess right  living a lie  was the hardest  part they said  wow  55  wait now  they died in what  2011  the first guy  12  so 45  55 years  that's 67  fucking years  man  all that shit  just fucking  skulking around  hoping not to be seen  showing affection  for another man  yeah the gays  really did have  a little fucked  yeah 
[01:57:00]  people really  didn't like the  gay  that's like some  kind of insecurity  thing  yeah  silly  I don't know  I think you're  worried about your  own little  feelings inside  or something  and it's also  this aversion  to wanting  maybe your  kids  to grow up  like that  especially back  then  like  I think the  worst thing  that could  happen  because back  then it was  pretty simple  you wanted  your son to be  on the football  team  and be successful  and grow into 
[01:57:30]  a fine man  get married  and have a  family of his  own  give you  grandkids  things like  that  it was all  very  very pat  you were  supposed to do  that  and then  no other ways  to look at it  by the way  there was never  an alternative  way to look at  what your life  could be  you just  explained the  American dream  when you're  sitting there  at the  fucking  VFW hall  and it's like  did you hear  about Robert's  son  oh yes  he's a little  light in the  loafers  you know  like you knew 
[01:58:00]  that they were  all talking about  it  I think that's  what made it  so like  and you didn't  know if another  gay guy was  gonna like  if he talked  to your  kid  if he was  gonna  turn him  gay  or if it  was contagious  like who knew  back then  no one knew  shit  they thought  they knew  yeah  we've played  some of those  videos over the years  we've played  those videos  like public  service videos  that they put  out  watch out  for the gay  can you  find one  Sam  that one  was  even if it's  one we've  played 
[01:58:30]  they really  thought they  knew  they equated  gay guys  with fucking  pedophilia  and molestation  and mental  illness  that's  that's  the one  yeah  is this  the one  Sid  Davis  Productions  presents  Fags and  You  oh it's  boys beware  oh boy  yes  produced with the  cooperation of the  Inglewood Police Department  and the Inglewood Unified School District  the cops were involved in this  could you imagine  I bet they gave a lot of 
[01:59:00]  wood shampoos  I bet they come back at night  with their billy club  smelling like duty  you know those guys  oh did they enjoy  the shit out of that  smell this  guarantee  fucking  oh you got one  did you  fuck 
[01:59:30]  now this is just a guy  driving in his car  yeah  lieutenant williams  oh he's a cop  officer attached to the  juvenile division  I'm on my way to Monroe  junior high school  to talk to a group of  young people  cock blocker  that looks innocent  enough doesn't it  what  lots of young people  hitchhike  seems like a good way  to get from one place  wow  at a bus stop  sometimes there are dangers  involved that never meet the eye  uh oh  god  hitchhike 
[02:00:00]  he was  accepted  right  he played baseball  all afternoon  and he didn't feel like  walking home  so he decided to  thumb a rod  in a tucked in shirt  he played baseball  yeah  and look at his  pants are up to his  fucking hands  yeah  where's his uniform  asshole stinks  yeah  like a dump in the woods  shit out come  he's done it a hundred times  before  a hundred times  and he didn't think  anything was unusual  when the driver  struck up a friendly  conversation  because he seemed  like a real nice guy  I bet  he asked jimmy  if he played baseball  in the park often 
[02:00:30]  jimmy told him  they practiced  no time a week  and played a rival  group  yeah  jesus  yeah  the stranger  was a good listener  too  and it only seemed  minutes before  they pulled up  in front of jimmy's  house  he knows where he lives  boy what a simpler  time  yep  when jimmy got out  the stranger  gave him a friendly  pat  oh  on his balls  with his mouth  and he pulled  oh  it looks like  fucking nicholson  that guy is a creep  oh my god  how'd you get in a car 
[02:01:00]  with this guy  oh man  how'd you like  your cock sucked  it does  it looks like nicholson  and john waters  a little  horrible mustache  this guy's great  oh yeah  this guy is definitely  a problem  he's got a john waters  mustache  he's horseshoe bald  yeah  and he's just got  the creepiest smile  yeah  he's got a lovely  lovely little thin stache  oh yeah  loves a cock near it  does he ever  he left his  hand on the boy  just a little too  yeah a little long  he gave him a friendly  pat  they just left it there 
[02:01:30]  for an extra second  this guy rules  he knows what he wants  yeah he's got a  fucking troll  sunglasses on  again  as he always drove  by the park  on his way home  the music is great  oh yeah  we think this is  like 1957 or so  yeah  that's about right  it's like the 50s  definitely  oh  he's back in the park  sure enough  the following day  when Jimmy finished  playing ball 
[02:02:00]  how stupid is Jimmy  Jimmy's a dolt  guy's sitting in the  passenger seat  he moves over  slides over  those big old  bench seats  in the car  I understand  there were some  innocence  but this  Jimmy's a dolt  oh he's stupid  stupider than  flavor flave  Jimmy's gonna get  fucked  he stopped at a  drive-in  and a stranger  treated him to a  coke  during their  conversation  he told several  off-color jokes  but Jimmy had  heard others  before  and well  it made him  you put velcro  on the ceiling  Jimmy  three if you 
[02:02:30]  slice them  thin enough  Jimmy  three ducks in the  pond  they're at the  pond  fishing  yes  oh yeah  yeah  little duck  pond  wow he's  really  hanging out  with this ghoul  Ralph  Ralph's right  yeah  little sandwich  baloney and  cum  you think he 
[02:03:00]  put cum in the  baloney sandwich  oh yeah  Ralph keeps  his sunrise  lunch  Ralph showed  him some  pornographic  pictures  check these  out  nice  hands him  over  what Jimmy  didn't know  was that  Ralph was  sick  a sickness  that was not  visible like  smallpox  but no less  dangerous and  contagious  a sickness  of the mind  you see  Ralph was a  homosexual  what  I love it 
[02:03:30]  fucking  smallpox  fucking diphtheria  it was deadly  and we wonder  why gays are  sensitive about  language  not only deadly  contagious  yes  contagious  diseases  because they're  setting this guy  up like he's a  serial killer  but no he's not a  serial killer  he's a homosexual  a sickness of the  mind  even if they're not  interested in you  you can still catch it  so stay away  you might get the  gay  holy fuck  yeah  wow  who demands an 
[02:04:00]  intimate relationship  with members of  their own  demands  demands  but by now  Jimmy felt a  rifle  for Ralph  and they continued  to go places  together  miniature golf  boy  like Jake  and Vicky  on a date  Ralph's bent  over  here  trying to  hit it in  here  get the  driver  uh oh  he's touching his back 
[02:04:30]  motel room  first asked Jimmy  to go fishing alone  he should have  discussed it with  his parents  or teacher  uh oh  finally Jimmy  told his parents  and they reported  it to the juvenile  he got her  fucking fucked in  the ass  yeah for sure  hope so  look how he's  walking  yeah  he can tell  his father's  patting his back  the same way  now that you're  broken in son  bend over for pop  some resort to  violence is in the  case of Mike  Merrick 
[02:05:00]  great music  Mike Merrick  is violent  so kids  don't play sports  in the park  all white kids  missing  violent  they knew even  that  uh oh  he needs to  practice  obviously  he's horrible  he's terrible  at this basketball  game  meanwhile  this guy  who's playing  this role  probably has  prostate cancer  he was friendly  and well 
[02:05:30]  it was better  than playing  alone  suit and tie  doing layups  right  piece of shit  who wants to do  layups  in a suit  yeah  Mike realized  he had already  overstayed his time  and suggested  he better leave  the stranger  told him  if he'd like  to stay longer  he'd be glad  to drive him  home when they  finish  throwing a bow tie  chance to play  longer  and get a ride  home too  he and the stranger  are frolicking  he's dressed like  a butler  yeah  butler  oh god  he's a ghoul 
[02:06:00]  they're not spending  enough time  focusing on the  fucking free throws  holy shit  the stranger  told him  he'd make  a fine player  someday  if he got  lots of practice  the companionship  the parade  cause the negro  hadn't started  playing  NBA yet  Mike might have  had about  going with a stranger  putting his arm  around him  probably never  realized  until too late  that he was  riding in the  shadow of death  sometime that evening  Mike Merrick  created his life 
[02:06:30]  for a newspaper  headline  wow  the gay guy  killed him  and fucked him  fucked him to death  Jesus  that's crazy  Denny and Jerry  got the papers ready  Denny  oh no  Denny's Falcone  oh boy  oh poor Denny Falcone  oh no  another homosexual

[02:08:00]  what a dork  what a snitch  tatler  rat  oh  he's delivering the papers  a 10 speed bike  that used to suck  when he delivered a paper  to Denny's house  he asked his mother  if they'd caught the boys  that had stolen the bicycles  what  Denny hadn't returned  so he told her the story  and gave her the paper  with the license number  gave her the paper  he googled it  googled it  hmm  being the dumb 50's mom she was 
[02:08:30]  she just threw it in the trash  Jerry supplied the necessary information  and the stranger's car  was quickly spotted  oh man  was a good example  of how important  oh I bet those cops  worked him over  yeah  are they at a dead end  yeah  why would he be driving  to the dead end  oh boy  he's gonna suck that kid's dick  oh  you know why  he jerked off  with those palm trees around  turn around  nice  pressing his heart on  against the car  public restrooms 
[02:09:00]  can often be a hangout  for the homosexuals  yeah  the homosexuals  oh don't walk under the pier  come on  you little fucking douche  why would you  there's guys right behind you  there's homosexuals under the pier  yes  they hang out under piers  and in sewage manholes  oh man  now look at this  ominous music  well  who goes home this way  nice ticket's a shortcut 
[02:09:30]  what are you gonna do  what are you a square  Bobby recognized the stranger  as the man in the restroom  the shortcut under the pier  didn't seem like a good idea at all  oh boy  drats  what a chicken shit  you're a termite opie  strictly out of the wood  after all  it's more fun to stay  with your friend anyway  Bobby had made a wise decision  it may have saved his life  you pause that by the way  here's the right decision  he can look at his dry dick later  and see how wise that decision was 
[02:10:00]  and they're pretty much saying  50% of the homosexuals in this town  kill you  they're murderers  wow  yeah  you can't trust them  it's a deadly disease  sickness of the mind  like smallpox  that's right  1961  someone said  61  okay  just about all  the decision is always yours  and your whole future may depend  on making the right one  so no matter where you meet a stranger  be careful if they are too friendly  if they try to win your confidence  too quickly  and if they become overly personal 
[02:10:30]  they could be  one never knows when the homosexual is about  when it's about  when you discover he is mentally ill  I know  we're Sal  look  the homosexual is about  unless you have the permission of your parent  or teacher  parents or teachers  they know  doesn't this just make you feel like  so weird and weird  oh it's so strange  so the time  it's not even that  I mean it's really not that long ago  it's not  just the houses are different 
[02:11:00]  yeah  I mean it's 50 what  52 years ago  it's like a time machine there  people equated homosexuality with  killing children  murdering  and uh  yeah  and sickness  a contagious sickness  in which  you're forced to kill kids  right  no one really knows  when the homosexual is about  and and then  it seems so weird  when you do the Gus and Elmer thing  and and  you're like wow  why they fucking shut up for so long 
[02:11:30]  oh  oh  I see  they thought they were murderous  fucking pedophiles  right  yeah  because this is 61  where maybe they started  opening their minds  maybe slightly  right  so you can only imagine 1945  yeah  oh god  that's 16 years before this  crazy  what do they think back in 45  of the homosexual  they thought they were vampires  probably  oh yeah  yeah  they really were  they were treating it like  it was an outbreak  oh  homosexual  there's been an outbreak  of homosexuality

[02:21:00]  is not working  again?  yeah  holy shit  shit  every day  and it just falls  on deaf ears  how fucking embarrassing  how embarrassing  this falls on deaf ears  everyone  just  all I ask  I guess at this point  is just tweet  Sirius XM  that's their Twitter  constantly  let them know  just constantly  every time  it goes out  please  tweet them 
[02:21:30]  and I guess you could  also do  another Twitter account  that honestly  is completely useless  it's  S  X  M  underscore  help  that Twitter account  is completely useless  you don't think that's helpful  oh god  so you could tweet them as well  but every time it  goes out  do that for us  because  maybe they'll understand  yeah  maybe  when they see the volume  of people tweeting  that their fucking app  that they're paying for 
[02:22:00]  is not working properly  sorry  online listening  is expensive  yeah  fuckers  but no one even  talks to us  about any of this stuff  where's Tim  we've said it a thousand times  I think he's in LA  or something  I don't know  but like  other responsibilities  like even with these rants  like  even if they sat us down  and said  alright knock it off  assholes  or  hey  what can we do  to make things better  yeah yeah 
[02:22:30]  we get neither one of those  mhm  that's like the  that's the strangest thing  out of all  you know  yeah  alright well  Family Feud  had something terrific  we just lose  like a shit load  of our audience  every day  in the middle  of listening  I see it  on Twitter  people just like  oh  I can't listen anymore  I'm not  dealing with this anymore  I'm not paying for this anymore  yeah  yeah 
[02:23:00]  we get a lot of those  every day at this point  so  did Don write me  I checked four phones  all apps are working  maybe  it's just that one guy  no it's not one guy  my Twitter has a lot  so maybe it's back working again  I don't know  maybe by the time  I got the message out  on the air  it's working again  you know  it's every day  it's every fucking day 
[02:23:30]  it's every day  and  and we just  and then  there's  it might be just  certain phones  might be all phones  they never have  an answer for us  they can't really figure out  pinpoint exactly  what the problem is  yeah  because then they might  check on a phone  that app works  so they just assume  it's working for everybody  what do we have  Family Feud right  yeah let's do the family 
[02:24:00]  I want to hear what  that's all about  I think I know  you do  I might  because somebody tweeted  something yesterday  yeah  about Family Feud  and I think  it might be  okay  I can't imagine  it's anything else  Family Feud is not  ladies here we go  we've got the top  six answers on the board  I'm more amazed  this show is on the air still  doesn't sound like  fucking Richard Dawson  it's that black dude  yeah  who's extremely overrated  I forget his name though  Jamie Foxx  Steve Harvey  I like Steve Harvey  Steve Harvey  you like his comedy

[02:25:00]  he wants to talk about  at parties  is baseball  and painting  with the former president  they are now  his obsessions  and that's pretty good  wow  unbelievable  alright still a cover  that's great  he's an original  by George Bush  that's kind of creepy  that next president  just wants to talk about  baseball and painting  I painted you  I painted a picture  of you here  you like it?  what did he see  that he has decided  I don't want anything  to do with this shit  ever again  a lot of presidents  like he doesn't show up

[02:29:30]  doesn't  web player  working  but phone  app is  generally  shit  I'm just  trying to  do like  some  investigating  myself  here  maybe  over time  crashing  this guy's  been listening  to that  all morning  no problems  no problems  with the  S3  I got  an iPhone  problems  works about  20 minutes 
[02:30:00]  and then  stops  just  stop for  20 minutes  holy shit  it's just  a fucking  do we still  have a deal  with audible.com  yes  we do  I remember  that  but the shows  get up there  slowly some days  because I get  that problem  half the times  people just  can't find the  shows  I think you  hand it off  but then maybe  what they're  doing is slow  or something  you can go to  audible.com 
[02:30:30]  we get a  I don't know  subscription there  for the show  as well  we get a little  taste of that  but nothing  tasty taste  little tasty  taste  did you see  the story  on google  earth  with the  kids  oh man  the kids  dead body  on the  train tracks  or just  off the  train tracks  just off  the train  tracks  and there's  cops there  and they're  investigating  the scene  and it  ended up  on google  earth  so when  you do  the google  earth  thing  every once  in a while  they catch  some crazy  shit  and this  is a dead  body  so the 
[02:31:00]  family is  like what  the fuck  and then the  google people  are like oh  yeah we'll  change that  immediately  but immediately  for them is  what four  weeks or  something  I think  they were  saying  did you see  this  pretty crazy  California  here let me  see the headline  there Sam  California dad  wants google  maps image of  dead son  removed  but there  there is  his dead  son  who was  fucking  killed  right off  the train  tracks  there  about  three  four  feet  off  the  tracks  and there  google earth  actually captured  the murder  scene 
[02:31:30]  how the fuck  does anyone know  what that is  who figured out  what that is  that's the  strangest thing  about it  because people  look around  and they  fucking start  you think  people are so  bored they're  just looking  around and  hoping to  find some  shit  you look  around for  something you  find out the  area you could  google that  and you know  see what  happened  right  that's what I  did with this  story actually  what do you  mean  well I googled  the name of  the father's  name and stuff  and found out  what the actual  story was  it was shot  right  they never caught 
[02:32:00]  who did it  14 years old  yeah so I  guess if you're  just kind of  trolling around  on google earth  and you find  something you  could you know  where it is  because it's on  google earth  sure you put  that in google  kind of a  description of  the scene  and you might  get some info  on what  actually happened  there I guess  that's all done  with helicopters  now is that  what they're  using yeah  yeah it's not  like satellite  sat light  it's pretty  amazing technology  it is to get  that the street  view is amazing  to me that  I finally started 
[02:32:30]  using the jeep  I know  I finally started  using the gps  on my phone  oh  did you  fucking ridiculous  you can demand  gps  but when they  first had that  as an app  it was kind of  a little sketchy  now it's like  fucking detailed  yeah you can get  the walking directions  or the driving  directions  they'll tell you  which two signs  are coming up  and then they'll  read the sign  I know I'm  explaining this shit  but it's just  amazing  you can just do it  on your phone  like nothing  though  well there's  some apps too  that and they're  really getting much  better at this  technology  you hit the app 
[02:33:00]  it uses your camera  right  and then you can  kind of sweep  around  and it'll put  little labels up  on what every  store is  wow  it'll say like  that way  is some kind  of attraction  or something  wow  they're gonna  start using that  in amusement parks  too  where you're walking  around  it'll say like  instead of looking  for the sign  that says  you know  space mountain  this way  you just hold  it up  and it'll say  space mountain  it'll guide  you right to  the attraction  you want to go  to  it puts the  virtual screen  over like a  heads up display  over the camera  view 
[02:33:30]  but all you have to do  is move your  camera around  and it'll recognize  and it'll pop in  all the info  you need  and it pops the info  in  it's pretty fucking  cool  pretty cool indeed  holy fuck  yeah yeah  remember the other  google earth image  of the dead body  but it turns out  it was a dog  or something  we talked about  that one as well  do uh  the one on the  bloody dock  yeah the bloody dock  but it turns out  it's a wet dog  or something  oh it was  oh you know what  red wood  or something like  that would look  we talked about  this one as well  this was another 
[02:34:00]  famous one  just uh  bloody dock  or dog  it's bloody dock  yeah do dock  because it might  not even be the  dog  I'm trying to  remember exactly  we talked about  this a while ago  image there  yeah there it is  wait go to the  headline again for  the people that  don't know the  story  google earth  killer who left  grizzly but  bloody trail on  jetty is revealed  to be a wet dog  so supposedly this  was a killer  killed somebody on  this dock  and then you know  they dragged the  body away I guess  that's what it  looks like 
[02:34:30]  right but it  turns out it's  just like you  said because it's  kind of red wood  and then you get  that wet it looks  very it looks  kind of bloody  and it turns out  to be a wet dog  but for a while  people really believed  that was a murder  scene  it really is amazing  that people study  so much  yeah who the fuck  studies google earth  that's a lot of  real estate  that's a quarter I  dropped  yeah what was the  other one we did  the street view  with the naked  black prostitute  or something  coming out of the  house  what was it again

[02:40:30]  she's going  inside right  no no she's  she's got like  a uh sarong  around her  bikini bottom  so she pulls  down her  bikini bottom  okay i see  all right  the bikini bottom  is around her  knees  she's bending  over the squat  position in front  of the car  and  can you see i  can't see  dumps are mud  right there  yeah that's  probably an awful  period shift  now she's  looking and 
[02:41:00]  then she lets  go of her sarong  and it looks  like her sarong  is hanging on  the shit  you know when i  shit in public  you gotta look  it's it's it's  yeah in private  you gotta look  it's quite  impressive i i  don't with the  bowl as much  she's wiping  well if you  spread properly  you could almost  get away without  the wipe  if you're  desperate i'm  saying until  you find a  water after  if she has  to shit so  bad that she's  going there it's  going to be a  bad shit  there it is  as she walks  away  she just

[02:42:00]  ricardo  yeah let's  get him  i think  roland's making  them sign  things first  why is ricardo  here  i'm guessing  it's one of  his training  partners  and i'm  thinking  he's fighting  on the  car  come on in  man  gary um  dominic cruz  down from there  come on in  take a seat  gentleman  right over here  sure pull up  a seat  what's going on  guys  yeah you don't have to  worry about sam  roberts he's not  going anywhere  and i mean that  and i mean that in  life  how are you doing  how are you  brother  opie  you meant i am  going  i wasn't going  anywhere  i meant in

[02:43:00]  like that conversation  we were just  looking at a video  of a girl in a bikini  taking a shit  in public  you guys put a video  up like that  well it's already  up out there  somebody put it  there yeah  she walked into  it  yeah yeah  yeah she's uh  she was in  it was like  a fucking  carport  and she was like  at the beach  and she just ran  and took a quick  dump  she thought she could  get away with it  it's great  it's good because  she's kind of hot  she's hot  and then she walks  away and her load  is just sitting there  in front of this  guy's car  there's nothing  you should do  she could have  at least buried it  in the sand  or something  i know right  no it's a garage  she just sat there 
[02:43:30]  it's great  there's no wiping  either  well i didn't see  her wiping  i think you're right  just walk properly  you can get away  with it for a little bit  a little bit  until you find a place  to wipe properly  i don't think so  that's what i think  yeah yeah yeah  she's got the  she's going to the beach  so  i should at the ocean  you shit at the ocean  right  no  you don't shit  at the ocean  well maybe she couldn't  or maybe she's on the  way back to the car  and she had to just  drop a deuce  but i think you just  got to go to the water  after that  and just kind of  open your ass  a shitting partner  marinade  you don't shit at the ocean  no that's terrible 
[02:44:00]  i shit at the ocean  i mean  people are swimming  no you gotta  you gotta figure out  the tides and stuff  and the seagulls  will take care of  most of the damage  Shane eating  mcdonald's though  fucking  drinking guinness  the beach birds  don't mind a good  oh really  a good meal  they start  going around like  they're following a  crab boat  it's amazing  yeah  it's amazing  how did we get here  i was gonna say  sorry you probably  open every interview  you guys are doing  what  yeah yeah  same way  that's the most  common start of an interview 
[02:44:30]  we want it to be  so shitting  we want it to be  unforgettable for the guys  yeah we were only  expecting uh  uh dominic and uh  and ricardo  you're with them too  you guys training together  or you just on the same  uh  the same card  we haven't trained together yet  i'm sure sooner or later  yeah yeah  i'd love to train with  dominic sometime  you know  yeah but no  we just met up here  basically like  hey you're here  hey you're here  all right  okay  what do you  what do you  are you on uh  in february too  yeah uh  i'll be the call  main event  um against jose aldo  for the 145 pound belt  oh my god  wow  i can't believe 
[02:45:00]  although i mean  we'd love to have  interviewed him  but i don't think  he speaks english  i think  no i don't think so  either  only uh  portuguese  he doesn't either  no you guys are both  fighting fucking  murderers  i mean really  really scary guys  murderers  really i mean  they're both  really frightening  uh they're both  brazilian guys right  yeah they're both  from the same team too  so they train together  and you know  the leg kicks  i've taken a lot of  moves on the leg kick  is the worst thing  to me in mma  because it just  it really just  paralyzes you  and that's all  aldo does  yeah  yeah i gotta 
[02:45:30]  you know  it's definitely something  that i'm gonna work on  in my camp  and uh  i'll come up with  a good game plan  to counteract that  yeah  because everybody's  looking for the big  punch  the big knockout  punch stuff  you gotta realize  that is gonna  fuck you up  for a while  oh yeah  uh those  consistent leg  blasts like that  do you ever get  hit so hard  this happened to me  uh because jones  hit me in the leg  and i almost  shit my pants  missus  no  he hit me in the leg  and i was so not ready  my body almost felt  like i wanted to shock  i had to shit  like that was how  that's the sign 
[02:46:00]  of a real man  fight or flight  and i had to shit  see back to shitting  see  oh man what happened  but it does happen  right  you were nauseous  right  dude i thought  i was gonna faint  and vomit  wow  that bad  where's the worst  place to get hit  we ask a lot  of you guys this  besides the balls  or the eyes  obviously  yeah liver shots  the liver shots  are the worst  oh god damn  that sounds dangerous  what does that feel like  any way to describe it  just an off button  on your body  just an off button  just an off button  you're done  like i'd say  you can't breathe  okay like when you  uh you're an idiot 
[02:46:30]  doing something stupid  when you're a kid  and you jump off  and you land on your back  knocked the air out of you  right  that's what it feels  oh wow  that  yeah yeah  nothing's going in  that's what happens  except you're hunched forward  oh shit  and that ends most fights  right  oh yeah  it always depends  on how bad it is  right  well will the other fighter  back off if he knows  you've lost your wind  just to give you a second check  yeah yeah  okay you okay now  yeah  take a minute  relax  no that's boxing  yeah  and then they stand you back up 
[02:47:00]  and you get hit again  how much of the liver  is exposed  as far as when you're fighting  what do you mean by that  i don't know  is it the whole thing  is exposed  i gotta look at anatomy again  yeah it's all there  most of it  it's all there  it's big  right above the belt line  just behind the love handle  big nasty organ  so you gotta hit the spot  the spot man  it hurts  and you've been out for two years  you haven't fought in two years  it'll be about four months longer  than gsp was out  what was the injury again  what was the injury 
[02:47:30]  uh acl  oof  yeah it's been fun  you had two operations  yeah  and uh  dana came out recently  and did dana like  he did  yes it was really shocking  yes  him and don king are life partners  really bizarre coupling  but no dana came out recently  and said uh  that  he thought you could have fought sooner  um  and it didn't seem like he was shitting on you though  it almost seemed like  what he was saying  is that you were doing a smart thing  like cause you're fighting  such a tough fighter  that's how i took it 
[02:48:00]  i didn't  you know  media can twist  things so well  no  you know  and i can't see dana going out there saying  yeah  like if he thought i was bullshitting  he would have thrown me in earlier  you know  so  yeah that's true right  yeah  all he has to do is drop the hammer  and say fight  you're fighting whether you like it or not  uh-huh  so obviously he's on my side right  i mean  that makes more sense  it's common sense  yeah  but media's gonna say  yeah he's been out longer  like oh so i told dana  sorry dana  i'm gonna have to take another six months  you go ahead and sit on your hands 
[02:48:30]  and wait for me  yeah  don't think so  it's dana going you know  take what you need here  okay we came up with a date together  and do what you gotta do  and he said okay  we agreed  so when dana's saying that  it has to do with him saying you know  he's ready for this fight  yeah yeah  that's what it means  yeah cause he  cause he says things sometimes  that uh  as a fighter like you hear it  you're probably like  oh why is he saying that  you gotta think things through  you know a lot of fighters  that hear something dana says  they take it immediately emotionally  you gotta really set your emotions aside 
[02:49:00]  and hear what dana's saying  as a promoter  and running a business  and then you know  figure out what he means  has he ever yelled at you  he yells at everybody  that's kind of the impressive part  is that  fighters are frightening guys  but  he's intense  he's a very intense dude  he's never yelled at me  like pointing and yelling  but he just  he's an intense dude  yeah exactly  yeah  we're all intense though  so he works really hard  so  yeah he works out  do you yell back at him or no  do fighters yell back at him  no he just  you just kind of sit there  and  you motherfucker  you just sit there and go 
[02:49:30]  okay  cause he's the boss  he's always  out of a job real quick  start yelling back at dana  you say look  you're big and stuff  but you know  I could kick your ass  dana  you're like okay  whatever you want  yeah that worked well  for tito right  yeah that didn't work out  is that what happened with them  they guys never seem to like each other  never  Jesus  they were doing really great  then all of a sudden  one guy on twitter  is motherfucking the other guy  whatever it is  it's like what happens to them  yeah they were supposed to have  that little boxing match  against each other  and then tito never showed up  for the weigh in  supposedly 
[02:50:00]  dana was always just pure boxing  yeah pure boxing  yeah cause dana used to box  you really think about it  you're tito ortiz  you're on a good limelight  you know you're doing good things  you're off wins and stuff  and you get knocked out  by the promoter  of the show you fight in  it's a no win situation  that's a lot of  yeah you beat him  it's like oh good  you just beat him up  if you lose to dana  you're in a lot of trouble  so it's like  yeah i don't think  you want to make weight  yeah so if you beat  if you beat dana  he's like well fuck this guy  i don't want him fighting for me  and if he beats you  he's like fuck that pussy  i beat him up  why is he going to fight 
[02:50:30]  in the ufc  exactly  that's kind of a no win situation  yeah yeah  so how do you guys feel too  you're fighting in newark  february 1st  which is super bowl weekend  and uh  it's just the embarrassment  of it not being legal  in this state  like you know  in weidman's from here  and it's like  new york puts so much  money into the ufc  and they just won't  legalize mma here  i have no idea  what the issue is  i mean that's far  beyond my knowledge  i don't get it  it's frustrating  i just don't get it  so it's like  when people ask me  i don't know 
[02:51:00]  for years they used  the excuse  oh it's too brutal  oh there's no rules  oh it's crazy  and bloody  and uh  and now we got girls  pooping in garages  yeah exactly  yeah you want to see  shocking  there it is  that is the best part  of the internet though  is just catching people  doing shit  that they're not supposed  to be doing  yeah right  yeah yeah  there's something hot  about a girl  just sneaking in  taking a shit  and running out  it's kind of cute  yeah those  those are disgusting  people man  yeah  i mean i think she just 
[02:51:30]  the starbucks is an epidemic  yeah  and i think that's what  oh that probably is  caramel macchiatos  and was just like  oh my god  the romps are coming  had to take a coffee dump  got it in you know  and left  do you know how bad  you have to shit  to commit a b and e  she basically committed  a b and e to take a shit  like you really have to go  and it wasn't  you need to take a bm  it wasn't a coffee shit  there was some nice  consistency there  oh yeah  oh it was nice  it wasn't as loose  as a coffee shit  no no  it was  it was hanging in there  hanging in there  it wasn't collapsing 
[02:52:00]  it wasn't the spirit  that's wonderful  didn't look like an oil leak  heading toward the drain  what are we doing  sorry  sorry guys  what the fuck is this  we're usually not that bad  i don't know what's going on  you guys literally just  happened to show up  as we were watching  the video  normally we just  you know  we didn't have any time  in between the two  drag me into this  you're um  you're really  is this the guy  you want to fight  coming back  after two years  like i mean  wouldn't you  what happened  you were the champion  and now he's the interim champion  which means that  when they know the belt's 
[02:52:30]  going to be vacated  they give him the belt  or they had two guys  fight for the belt  right  correct  and who did he beat  he beat  for the belt  he beat Faber  and um  um um um  Eddie Wineland  those are the two people  he defended against  or won and then defended  i beat  Scott Jorgensen  to win it  and then i  which he fought also  and then i fought  Faber  to defend it  and then i fought  uh  Demetrius Johnson  to defend it  do you not like Uriah 
[02:53:00]  was there a thing  between you guys  where there was  kind of a genuine  dislike  uh  i just don't talk  about him  he doesn't matter  right now  i'd rather not  even talk about him  who cares  but do you get it  how do you feel  about him  i mean i know  i think you have to  have an aggression  towards somebody  when you fight  him  but it's gotta be  harder to fight  a guy you like  i don't really  like  i don't like anybody  i mean like  Jackie's a strong  word man  uh  it's like  it's not that  i dislike him  but it's  you know  i like Ricardo  but me and Ricardo 
[02:53:30]  were fighting  we'd fight  and we'd sit here  the same way  we are right now  it's more of a  mutual respect  than like  like or dislike  somebody  you know what i mean  it's hard  it's hard to hate  somebody that you  don't even know  you know what i mean  that's something  that i think  only you fighters  can even understand  cause uh  you know  for a civilian  uh  when you're fighting  it's because you  don't like someone  you have a problem  with them  so that's really  the only comprehension  we have of fighting  you guys  it's your sport  it's your life  you can have a  friendly conversation  and 
[02:54:00]  what amounts to  beat the shit  out of each other  and then still  be friendly  can't you develop  a quick hate  after the guy  splits your face open  i would hate immediately  like now i don't like  this guy  yeah has there been  somebody that  after the fight  you didn't like  him a little more  than you did  going into it  just because of  the fight  itself  and not  because there  was trash  talking  or any of that  right right  so strange  to understand  this  just one guy  you know  i haven't  i haven't liked  in all my career  that's it  everybody else  whether i  you know 
[02:54:30]  fought him  and we went  five rounds  or one round  i've never had  a problem  with them  you know  i've had guys  leave scars  on my face  and the weird  thing about that  is you see  a scar on your  face  and it's like  oh  you think about  that person  oh you remember  that person  wow that's  fucked up  yeah  i see it  i just see it  as yeah  i see it as  like a different  story to tell  people you know  yeah yeah  god damn  right  so it's like  you kind of  get a weird  as it's like  a weird  closeness  to the fight  yeah it's like  a connection  i really expect  you can't really 
[02:55:00]  explain  does it bring you  closer to uh  to uh  it's like  when two ex-presidents  talk like  you know  clinton will talk  to uh  bush senior  or guys  that were  carter and  bush senior  do you get  some kind  of a weird  bond  regardless of  who the guy  is  like  like i said  it does depend  on the chemistry  of the person  too  like if the  person's a weirdo  the person's a weirdo  i think of it  like when school bus  drivers wave at each  other  it's similar to that  you know you bring up  presidents  i bring up two kooks  that probably didn't  go through a background  check waving at each  other  and we do that 
[02:55:30]  if someone's driving  the same car as you  hey how you doing  hey you got one  like me  or like war vets  or something  you know like  two guys that have  shared you know  something like that  that they can talk  about you know  they share common  ground with that  aspect so  yeah  what did you guys  think about the  last fight  the uh  oh boy  from the  gsp hendrix  i thought it was  one of the most  awesome fights ever  for me  i loved every second  of it  yeah  i thought it went  back and forth  um  it was close  when you look at  the comp you strike  in the numbers  you see gsp 
[02:56:00]  percentage wise  just edged out  hendrix every round  you're gonna beat  the champ  you have to not  just beat him  you gotta beat him  and and the fact  that gsp came out  above on numbers  on everything  and they tied  50-50 on takedowns  so that's the  difference  most of the time  gsp just schools  people  hendrix is just  that good  that he was able  to make it a fight  make it a split  decision  but to me  i'm not upset  with the with the  decision that they  made if you look  at the numbers  uh gsp landed 
[02:56:30]  more  they were even  on takedowns  but the percentages  were all favored  gsp at the  comp you strike  now if you watch  the fight  you see he had  more damage done  to him  and it looked  like the toughest  fight he's ever  had  so i think  people are  pretty upset  but that's  just hendrix  hits like a  train  so regardless  you know  he might not  have thrown  as many punches  as gsp  but he hit  a little bit  i think that  should be taken  into consideration  it's just so  odd that it's  such a  mathematical  reason to  have him win  instead of 
[02:57:00]  taking into  consideration the  fact that  you know that's  what the sport's  about it is  really you know  inflicting some  damage and boy  did he inflict  some fucking  damage  well it wasn't  that bad i mean  what did he have  a little he had  a little cut they  both had cuts i  think or no just  gsp yeah gsp both  his eyes were kind  of swollen he had  you know abrasions  all over his face  and and you know a  little cut under one  of his eyes and i  saw a picture of  johnny hendrix and  it looked like he  only had kind of  like a little black  guy on one side  yeah it looked bad  when he was at the  post-fight presser 
[02:57:30]  there he was he  was beat up pretty  good there's not a  finish though it's  hard to decide you  gotta look at the  numbers if there's  no finish that's  otherwise what's the  point of keeping  track if this is  like say do the  numbers do they  count for something  like if i hit you  twice and you hit  me once you're  probably gonna do  me that's what i'm  saying yes well  not to say he didn't  even knock me down  but he's gonna do  more damage with his  one punch than i did  with my two that's  true but if you  looked at just the  numbers it would say  well i got in two i  guess significant  strikes and you only  got in one but we  would all know just 
[02:58:00]  from the fact that i  was kind of like  fucking blinking  rapidly and loopy  that i got much  more damage  how about this  though how about  if a guy's um in  wrestling if a guy  shoots six takedowns  and the other guy  doesn't shoot any  well that guy just  shot six takedowns  you defended them  all now you have  all that energy from  defending defending  defending and not  being offensive and  now you finish your  double so now he  tried six times  didn't get any you  tried once and  finished it well it's  because you conserved  all your energy to  finish that one where  the other guy's  outputting outputting 
[02:58:30]  outputting outputting  forward giving  putting forth the  effort how do you  adjust that you know  how do you adjust that  one person's trying and  and outputting more  energy than the other  one while the other  one waits and waits for  that one big shot you  got to level that out  somehow and that's the  numbers are for okay  uh how did you see it  um you know i kind of  agree with with  dominic cruz i think  that gsp won the  competition uh i think  if you look at the  damage i think that  hendrix won the fight  you know what i mean  if you would have put  those two guys next to  each other and and if 
[02:59:00]  i didn't see the fight  you know like who do  you think won this  fight i'm like oh my  god this guy got his  ass kicked you know but  uh you know when the  numbers come into play  it switches everything  around um but but i  think that damaged  cause should should you  know be a little heavier  in the decision of the  fight like if me and  dominic get into a fight  and i slap him ten times  and then he decks me  like five times and  breaks my nose and i  connected well i hit him  more but he you know he  messed me up you know  he won that i'm not  gonna go around saying  i won that fight but  uh you know i just 
[02:59:30]  think uh i think they're  still trying to figure  out how exactly to  judge it you know the  sport is so young that  i think they still need  to fix a few things  with the judging and  boxing criteria to the  judging and it just  doesn't apply really  yeah in a lot of ways  yeah so i think in  time it'll just fix  itself and uh it'll be  better yeah joe called  in what was it monday  we talked to joe and  he said something about  the system they're using  is not uh he said  they should probably get  away from that system  because these are guys  that don't even know  the martial arts that  well they don't take  the martial arts  the problem is you're  using boxing boxing 
[03:00:00]  period yeah for a fight  where if you were just  if you would score it  like boxing we'd be the  most cheating boxers  you've ever met in your  life right right look  it's a boxer that's  kicking and you're  stepping on his foot  sir it's illegal that  is true yeah bernard  hopkins look like an  injury you know yeah  yeah so is he a dirty  fighter is bernard a  dirty fighter i wouldn't  say dirty he's just  grimy man like not  dirty in the in the  negative respect but  dirty and i respect the  way that he fights he 
[03:00:30]  fights like he's not  and and the way he  fights is he hangs on  you and then breaks and  punches it's a different  style that you gotta  respect he's just grimy  he's been there's so  many of those finesses  that should be judged  that uh just can't be  judged on the boxing uh  rules and judging so  100 yeah yeah i guess  they'll figure it out  do you ever get stood up  sometimes uh joe raised  the point too that and  i thought that this the  asian i forget his name  mario uh yamasaki yeah  was a bit a bit involved  more than he should have  been like i know when 
[03:01:00]  two guys are taking a  break you got to stand  them up but if two guys  are doing something in  the middle of the ring and  he just kept breaking it  up and making them  separate i'm like why is  he doing that like they  were they were doing  something you know uh  when it comes to refs  breaking guys up putting  them together you kind of  as a fighter you got to  take the adjustment and  just say it is what it is  that i mean you can't  when you're in there you  can't say oh what's this  all about then you're  not focused it's just  like oh we're standing  up let's go but if  you're trying to put a  move on somebody and it  looks like you know oh 
[03:01:30]  they're not giving the  crowd enough action but  you're trying to lock  something in or sit and  and the the ref comes  over and breaks it up  it kind of you got to be  pissed it does yeah i  could imagine it would  piss you off i haven't  ran into that issue so  much to be honest um you  just got to stay busy  can't look like you're  resting right right okay  they'll stand you up if  you look like you're  trying to get a breath of  air get a little break  yeah yeah so the most  part if you're advancing  or if you're causing  damage the ref isn't  going to stand you up  but if you just sit in  there and you know 
[03:02:00]  throwing these little  shots or whatever then  uh it's kind of up to  the to the discretion of  the ref whether you know  he's going to stand you  up or not and some  refs stand up faster than  others and you just got  to whatever ref you get  you just got to take  what you get it's weird  when you get a sport that  has that stupid fucking  human factor in it where  it depends on a ref or  an ump or you know  an official on the  field it's it's not so  slide rule and  mathematical it's like  all right two plus two  isn't always four he  might have missed the  two part he's calling it  two you know i would 
[03:02:30]  like for it for them to  be i would like for  there to be like  challenges and stuff  that that would be a  huge thing for me i  think because you see  refs make mistakes and  ruin fights for not  these are aren't fights  just for the fighters  they're for the fans  they're right so much  more than just the two  people in their fighting  that's affected by a bad  decision for instance a  a good example would be  ross pearson melvin  the largest fought  recently and there was  an illegal knee thrown  and it was like kind of  confusing like was it  illegal was right right  yeah i remember that 
[03:03:00]  why was it illegal what  was it legal about it  it was illegal because he  was down um but he was  on his way up and it  was hard to tell like if  his hand was still  touching or if ross's  knee was still touching  while melvin threw it  which they were so it  was an illegal strike but  you know it's hard to  say like what why can't  the why can't the  fighter be like i'm good  let's just finish this  we're both here put some  vaseline on this  you're good with it  you know yeah you're  good i'm good yeah  let's finish this because  we put in a 10-week  training camp people are  waiting for this fight  you know uh we're the 
[03:03:30]  co-main event it's just  it's so i just wish they  could like look at film  and be like all right  yeah yeah yeah yeah that  would be uh kind of  like football does unique  wouldn't it what's  roland up to no i can  just hear noise i was  talking about to close  the door all the way  oh really oh wow  from the outdoor so  sometimes they don't  want your clothes all  the way people yapping  and you're uh i i'm  you're 31 and 1 i think  and you're no that's  you're thinking of  burrows record oh  shit you're uh 16 and 
[03:04:00]  1 or i'm 20 and 1  20 okay i'm just i'm  just gonna start naming  numbers now it's right  i knew i always had the  one part and uh your  one lost was to favor  was it uh a decision  unanimous decision  uh yeah it was  unanimous decision  do you feel i know  i'm i'm do you  actually feel he won  that fight or did  you feel it was a  bad decision or is  it one that you  look back on and  go no he definitely  got it me like yeah  like how do you  like i'm talking about  it i don't remember it  so i'm not i'm saying  is a decision do you  ever feel like you've  been robbed and  since you've only had 
[03:04:30]  one loss and it was  decision that's why i'm  asking you like because  the refs ever kind of  like the judges fuck you  i've had more than  one decision unfortunately  and i don't feel i  haven't been robbed  okay if anything anybody  i've fought says they've  been robbed by me so  oh shit so i mean that's  just people are going to  say that if it goes to a  decision any kind of  decision you you almost  guarantee you the person  who got who lost by  decision is going to say  he didn't yeah yeah it's  almost a guarantee right  especially like the fights  that i have i kind of like  pick people apart i make 
[03:05:00]  them look kind of bad in a  lot of ways but i don't  necessarily you know put  their lights out every  single time i fight you  know so they have  something that they think  they can argue about even  if i school them for five  rounds they don't win one  round they get taken down  every round they get  punched and picked apart  they think they won because  they didn't get something  how do you how do you go  about making someone look  sloppy out there you just  make them miss make them  look silly you make them  miss you make them not look  like they can't figure you  out they never get a  rhythm they never  establish timing they never  establish range they're  always looking a little bit 
[03:05:30]  off one step behind that's  and that's from you  changing things up a lot  yeah you just gotta mix  don't fall into a pattern  yeah yeah you gotta mix  things up don't fall into a  pattern be unreadable be  unadjustable and and always  keeping them guessing that  way they're fighting your  game instead of you  adjusting to them they  adjust to you and people  look and they go oh look  this guy doesn't know what  the fuck's going on that's  pretty cool yeah the guy  yeah bro i'm thinking of is  he lost his first fight and  i think he's like 130  straight wow since that 
[03:06:00]  it's a really weird  that's a strange record  yeah and you but you  haven't lost in a while  either i mean you've  you fucking uh how long  has it been for you  has it been it's been  six years unfortunately  i've been out for two  of them so think about  that i keep in real with  myself you know but that's  gotta be frustrating it  was not to fight for two  years it was horrible but  i know what i'm capable of  i know what i would have  done if i was in and not  injured um i'm very  confident in myself and the  way that i work that's  that's what gives me  confidence it's not my  ability it's the way  that i work how'd you  get through the two 
[03:06:30]  years besides training  getting your body back  but it's working man but  after the training you're  sitting there like oh my  god it's gonna be at  least another year before  i could even think about  fighting that way you  don't right you think  day in day out every  single day is its own  battle so today is its own  battle tomorrow's gonna be  its own battle and i'm not  looking forward i'm in the  present pretty impressive  that you came back from  it yeah two years is a  long way a long time where  you could maybe lose lose  your desire or something  you know i guess did you  have any times where you  thought you were gonna  come back and it got  delayed or pushed back 
[03:07:00]  no oh yeah when i hurt my  knee the second time i was  six months into surgery or  into rehab when i blew it  out so i was like halfway  through the rehab and that's  why it took so long so i  went through did the rehab my  leg was already back to full i  was training that's gotta be  disheartening my leg the  size all the atrophy i'd built  back all that hard work and  then they're like yeah you  authority and how did you  charity and what were you  doing i was training i was  doing what i was allowed to  do oh just your regular  moves yeah plus i had my  brace on but it's a lot it's 
[03:07:30]  hard to understand unless you  know the difference of the  tendons and the different  types of certain there's no  blood flow going through the  tendon like it should have  been because my body rejected  the tissue oh okay it's big  boring thing no but it's not  so much just oh you worked it  too hard there was some kind of  anything like that right what i  was allowed to do but it was  just weakened because of lack of  blood flow because my body  rejected the foreign tissue  a cadaver tissue right it was  correct which i've always  wondered about that if you  have i mean i'm glad you're  grateful that you can do it  but how is it does it feel  weird to know that you have  somebody else's body part in 
[03:08:00]  you like does that did you do  you think of that like oh  jesus not if you try to fight  yeah yeah you don't care you  just want to care i don't care if  they put a rooster neck in there  right right no i don't mean does  it bother you but like do you ever  think like wow man there's  something in me that was that  that's from another person like do  you ever wonder it's not stupid but  like your ass yeah exactly that's a  great question i always know whose  finger it is because you know  they're right behind me and i'm  handing them money  i've always wondered about people 
[03:08:30]  that have you know hell yeah it's  kind of you got to think about that  a little bit right yeah i guess with a  heart it's a little bit different than  a tendon i mean my body didn't like it  yeah i guess so now what happened  that your body rejected it they took it  out or what what do they do now well  it just once it breaks it  disintegrates in your body  automatically so that was it and then  uh it snapped and then they went back  in and i did a different type of  surgery the second time i did the  patella tendon which they take the  little they take a chunk of the 
[03:09:00]  tendon that runs across the front of  your knee hmm and they put that where  the acl is therefore it's my own  tissue oh okay that's your own  immediately creates how they figured  that out yeah i don't know it's just  amazing amazing it really is what do  they do to keep your kneecap in place  um they sell it they sell it sit on  your butt for eight weeks in a cast  jesus christ so everything heals and  then you got to restart the process all  over again wow what do you hear in  therapy do you have to like restretch the  the tendon that they that they cut it's  just nothing fun it doesn't sound fun at 
[03:09:30]  all it's not fun zero fun you even  hit talking about it  it's just you know it's fascinating  you know it makes it interesting if  you're some guy with his leg up  watching the game and reading the paper  it's one thing to understand what you  have to do and what that has to go  through after repairing it it's that is  amazing it's funny because you know you  hear a lot like man dominic hasn't fought  in forever what does he deserve for man 
[03:10:00]  the fact that i'm coming back fighting  for a title after two acl reconstructions  it's not like i've been sitting down  doing nothing how am i coming back and  fighting in two years if i wasn't  working right right yeah yeah yeah i  wouldn't be ready unless i was doing  nothing but exercising working and  being in the gym so fucking turkey leg in  one hand a coke  bring it on it doesn't work that way i'm  not working as hard as i've always been  working i've never skipped a beat the  only difference is the dynamic has  changed into from therapy aspect or from  from fighting and preparing as a fighter 
[03:10:30]  to therapy just as hard to work just  different and i would assume you could  keep your strength up in other parts of  your body by working out uh without  putting anything on the leg but how do  you go about training you're moving and  you're throwing your punches and and what  you would do standing up in a ring you  got to work it into the i worked my  stand-up my footwork my shadow boxing  all that fluidity work uh into the  rehabilitation that was building the 
[03:11:00]  atrophy back out of my leg so like i had a  lot of atrophy that took place from  them cutting my leg and then it  automatically shuts off all the muscles  once they cut your knee open so all the  muscles shut off you have to re-establish  the the electric the the like um there's  like you know electric things that go from  your brain yeah i don't know all the  terms nerves and synapses you got to  wake them back up to get your muscles  firing again so if that's the first step  and then you gotta like there's just so  much to it man it's not easy it does  sound like you have to mix your footwork  in while you're building the muscle back  so your muscles learn how to move the 
[03:11:30]  way they did while you're building it  it's a true science it really is  amazing i'm amazed at that because when i  hurt my leg and i was i was doing it was  after the jones thing i was favoring it  and uh so i had to get a knee break i  really it's humiliating wow that is  humiliating but i get it i thought i  here's how i heard it like for real after i was  favoring it i was getting into bed in a hotel  hotel and i twisted wrong and i felt like  my leg was broken so the same injury you  get fighting a man i got getting into my  bed and fucking um i got a fucking 
[03:12:00]  knee brace and i'm walking up the steps  of the comedy uh whatever the club was in  doylestown and i'm like fucking limping  up the steps and i'm like this is never  going to get better i'm never going to be  oh you thought that was going to be  permanent yeah but and i don't have to do  anything with my legs like to have to  heal your leg and know that you're doing  that just to get in and have somebody  immediately try to re-injure it  the psychology behind that is  fucking fascinating absolutely i guess  yeah i don't really know what to think  of it when you explain it like that  in high school i was voted most likely to 
[03:12:30]  give a shitty explanation  i just feel like an idiot now  goal achieved  no it's a real uh it's a mental uh  strength that i i don't basically jimmy  you were on your own and these guys got  people that have figured out the  science of the whole thing but there's a  throw a brace on you and said good luck  yeah exactly good luck with the stairs  you know what's crazy about that is  they do that with you as an athlete too  really that's real that's real that's  something i've been trying to explain to  a lot of people is that that it's not  you you really like i had no clue i 
[03:13:00]  really wanted to believe that these  doctors and everybody like is like yeah  this guy's a professional athlete he's  trying to come back as an athlete and  they care  uh it's not that they don't care but  you are just another car that's in the  shop and they're fixing your wheel  yeah yeah i mean you're the 15th surgery  on their list you know and you're at  the end of the day and they're going to  put another acl in you and that's all  they know and they don't then then  when you're done there you're done and  then you go and they don't care what  physical therapist you see or don't see  if you could go and see nobody and it 
[03:13:30]  wouldn't matter to them right they're  not going to call you and say hey  what are you doing get over there  100 are on your own and that's the  hardest thing is finding the right  therapist for you that fits that's  challenging you like a professional  athlete should be challenged and you're  not not challenging you like you're  sitting behind a desk you know talking  about yeah yeah well obviously you  can't go to it's fun though yeah  you can just go to some schlep you're  just telling us that they have to  okay about the press but let's promote  this right because these fights are both  absolutely oh yeah amazing it's uh 
[03:14:00]  domina cruz is fighting i guess it's  the bantamweight uh championship against  and am i saying is right uh hennenborough  yeah hennenborough a brow okay who is a  great brazilian fighter and uh ricardo  lamis is fighting jose aldo who is just  fucking awesome it's gonna be great but  you're also an awesome fighter but i  thank you you know what i mean but that  guy's a beast  no but you know what i mean  i hear this all the time i know me too  i'm always amazed by guys who will fight  guys like if i had those guys in here  um i don't speak their language but i 
[03:14:30]  would be amazed that they're fighting you  like i'm always amazed when i'm talking  to somebody and they're fighting somebody  how about this i'm an analyst on fox and i'm  looking at the ricardo lamis jose aldo fight  and i'm taking lamis and that's not because  lamis is sitting here  that's because lamis can wrestle and i think  that his wrestling is going to slow up  you can't kick the legs when you got somebody  trying to take you down  and he also it slows down the heavy punches  that you want to sit down on because you're  worried about being taken down  and lamis is hard to submit and he's got good 
[03:15:00]  ground and pound from the top it's a tough  matchup for jose aldo so as good as aldo's looked  don't sleep on lamis  dude i would love to see you beat him  i would love to  i think that's been uh you know what happened a lot in the past is  i've been one of those guys that flies under the radar  i don't i don't talk you know i'm not a chel son  and i don't uh i don't talk a lot of shit  and because of that it's forced me to fly under the radar  but uh i sneak up on a lot of guys you know  it's it's like once you notice me it's too late  and that's another reason again why because i've been there  i know how that is i'm a good guy also so i respect that 
[03:15:30]  and i know how it is and you'll see  it's gonna be very cool when when is that  that's february 1st it's in jersey  at the prudential i think it is at the prudential center  um yes in new york  that means we'll be there  yeah i would love to go to that because  we go to those  stupid new york won't make it legal so  fuck new york we'll just go right across the river  and watch it there in a great new venue  yeah i've been there for fights and it's amazing  they do a great job  good luck to both you guys i would love both of you guys to uh  to win the belt  yeah i think they're panicking  they're panicking panicky pete's out there 
[03:16:00]  uh jimmy continues with his advice show  all right  see you guys tomorrow  thanks guys  could you guys sign  opie and anthony have left the building  but jim norton is not going anywhere  if you have problems at home  it's your lucky day  the jim norton show is next  jim norton is a moderately successful comedian  an average author  and a terrible actor 
[03:16:30]  and your chance to speak directly with him  call 866-969-1969  phone lines are open  and the jim norton show  starts now  hello  hello  hello  it is the jim norton advice show  that's the new theme song  we just had uh  ricardo lamas and dominic cruz on the opie and anthony show 
[03:17:00]  some guys don't like the ufc uh  you know i understand uh interviews if you're not a fan  but i i just love those fucking guys  i find them  they're just a different breed of human  and i'm just kicking myself  because opie said at the end  why you should have had them do like a double punch  i'm like i know i thought of it  and i forgot when i was being fucking sissy fanboy  and taking pictures  but then i'm mentioning it again  and eric's like  all right i heard you  eric just snapped at me  but he's right  eric's totally right  i said it  shut up and move forward 
[03:17:30]  but i harp on it  and uh unfortunately i was fucking uh  harping on it really loud  and eric did not care for that  who's by the way  who's the genius in there spelling these things  the guy  i have chronic masturbation issues  chronic c-r-o-n-i-c  maturbation  m-a-t-e-r-b-a-t-i-o-n  who's the dumbbell  it's one of the interns  he's panicking trying to get all the calls  i understand  i appreciate his efforts  uh scott in new york 
[03:18:00]  cause chronic masturbation issue  what's up jimmy  hey buddy  so you're probably the only sick bastard  who masturbates as much as i do  i probably jerk off as much as i did  when i was a teen  and  my prostate hurts  you know  and uh  but still every day  in the morning  i can't stop myself  and uh  what do you think i should do  well you have  the only way to uh  stop is to stop  you know maybe a 12 step group  for that  because it's a drug dip  a drip dude 
[03:18:30]  it's like i do it a lot too  not in the morning  but it affects my work  there's been times  where i was late  for the comedy cellar  by a couple of minutes  where i'm driving 80  down fucking 7th avenue  because i couldn't stop  jerking off  it is a constant  like a picture  like a little gerbil  hitting the little wheel  to get a fucking treat  that's what you're doing  it's not real  you're not horny  uh  you're simply  giving yourself  a drug  and i do the same thing  so 
[03:19:00]  it's a painful withdrawal  and i say painful  i mean it's like  you know  because you don't know  what to do with yourself  but the only way to do it  is give yourself  some time away  your cock sensitivity  will come back  you feel more focused  but that's the only way buddy  is just to stop doing it  okay  yeah thanks buddy  all right my friend  good luck  uh  let's see here  doug in boston  is having an issue  with recovery  hello doug  hey jimmy  uh  so  i put together  about uh  two and a half weeks  uh 
[03:19:30]  i got a sponsor  but the problem i have  is that i'm still having  issues with the program  and my sponsor  he's a guy i know  and they always say  that you're supposed  to hook up with somebody  who you know  you have a common  interest  and so on and so forth  but he's at a much  higher level than i am  and he wants me to go  to a uh  uh  12-step study group  and i'm not really  into that  how long you've been  sober  uh  let's see  uh  13 days  okay  let me tell you something  now you're supposed 
[03:20:00]  to pick a sponsor  if  in let's just say  a 12-step program  if you choose someone  to sponsor you  and help you  and guide you  i don't know  if you need to have  common interests  i think it should be  somebody whose sobriety  you respect  and whose recovery  you admire  uh  you know  they say  name the top three people  whose sobriety  you respect  and admire  your sponsor  should be one of those people  um  you should find somebody  who you like  what they have  and you want 
[03:20:30]  what they have  you admire something  about the way  they live their life  and their recovery  and the way  they help other people  and maybe  you know what  a 12-step study group  is not for you  long term  but why not  just do  whatever they  suggest that you do  like  the stubbornness  of us  and i say us  because i'm the same  as you man  i just happen  to be sober  longer  but i literally  am one fucking  tipping vodka  back to being  in the exact same  boat you are  i'm no fucking  you know  being more advanced  that just means  that you've been 
[03:21:00]  around longer  that's what you want  somebody who's  more advanced  so if you don't  like the 12-step  study group  maybe it's because  you don't like  the focus  or it feels like  school  or maybe you're  a little lazy  or whatever  you know  any of those things  that we all are  yeah  but why don't  you just do it  i mean look  at the option  is a life of  fucking  disgusting  addiction  and fucking  ruining everything  you'll ever get  or doing something  that you may not  like right now  and eventually  you won't have  to do  you know  what i mean  it's like  you're not  doing it  forever  but why not  just do 
[03:21:30]  what they  suggest  realize  that your  way  got you  absolutely  nowhere  so why not  just fucking  put down the  boxing gloves  you lost  let this guy  help you  i hear you  my problem  i have  is that  i'm struggling  with my  sobriety  as it is  and i don't  like the  meeting  i mean it's  you know  it's in a  place where  i sound  elitist  but you know  there's a lot  of guys 
[03:22:00]  actually he  brings a bunch  of guys  from a  halfway house  who don't  want to be  there  but they're  there anyways  because they  have to be  and it's  you know  it kind of  sucks  exactly the  kind of  people you  should be  around  and the  attitude  i'll tell you  what the  problem is  look at  those guys  and be  grateful  and it  sounds like  a trite  hack thing  to say  but be  grateful that  you're not  sometimes in  the same  shoes that  other people  are  you know  sometimes we  can be  grateful by  looking at  people  you know  i bitch  a lot  and i have  a great  life  it doesn't  matter  where you 
[03:22:30]  are  there's  always  someone  doing  better  and there's  always  someone  doing a  lot  worse  and you  know  what  i was  around  people  like  that  i think  of my  friend  wayne  who my  sponsor  used to  pick me  up with  and kenny  and kenny  is still  sober and  a good  friend of  mine  and wayne  is dead  and you  know  wayne  just  wouldn't  listen  i guess  wayne  had other  mental  problems  but wayne  is now  dead  and i  think of  all those  people  who yeah  a lot  of times  i didn't  like to  be around  them  or they  were  annoying  and you  know  what  those  are  the  ones  i  think  of 
[03:23:00]  because  you're  13  days  in  no matter  what  is  suggested  you're  going to  have  issues  with it  that's  what we  are  we're  fighters  we're  stubborn  you know  i understand  that  no i'm  pissed  every day  of my  life  yeah dude  just relax  just go  this is a  really tough  time but  it gets  easier i  promise you  just do  it just  even if you  don't like  it just  fucking do  it it's  not gonna  kill you  all right  thank you  good luck  man stick  with it  okay  yep 
[03:23:30]  hi uh  vinnie in  new jersey  boy do i  wish this  was fucking  i wish anthony  had a daughter  hi vinnie  hey how  you doing  jim  daughter's  looking to  date a  black guy  any advice  on how  you can  handle it  how old  your daughter  she's 14  oh god  okay how  old's the  guy  he's uh  15  all right so  it's not an  age thing  uh it's more  of an issue  i think i have  more of an  issue with it  than my daughter  and my wife  does  well and again  this is where  me not being  a parent hurts  the discussion  because i can't 
[03:24:00]  speak from  experience there's  nothing worse  than some  chinless hooker  loving douchebag  trying to tell a  real parent how  to do their  job i can only  suggest uh is  that a little too  young to be  dating i think  so i wanted her  to wait until she  was at least 16  to start dating  but of course i  get overruled by  the women in the  house okay well  your wife wants  her to date the  only thing i think  you can do  interracial dating  it's a it's a  blight on god  no i'm kidding  i i think that uh  the only thing you  can do is tell 
[03:24:30]  your daughter if  if she's going  to date and  if your wife  is for it is  to maybe talk  to her honestly  about the  problems about  it and prepare  her for some  of the  uncomfortable  ability that  she may have  to face but  who knows i  mean maybe it's  just one of  those things like  you know maybe  if it was 15 or  20 years ago it  would have been a  guy with long  hair a rock guy  with long hair a  burnout maybe that's  her idea of  rebelling or maybe  she just genuinely  likes the guy and  you should allow her 
[03:25:00]  to like who she  wants to like you  know what i mean  like almost like if  you interfere sometimes  you push someone to  really rebel um i'm  not saying that she  definitely she may  just genuinely like  this guy and not  care that he's black  that may i'm not  saying that that's  definitely a rebellion  but i wish i had a  better answer for you  because i have got no  experience with my own  kids so my suggestion  would be if your wife's  okay with it and your  daughter's okay with  it then maybe just  kind of let her do  it but some other  parents may call up 
[03:25:30]  and scream at me and  say i'm an asshole  what do you what do  you want to tell her  what do you want to  tell her uh i've  already told her that  i'm not i'm not too  keen on the whole  idea okay we we've  had discussions about  it but there is that  that separation between  us we were pretty  close but now there's  that separation because  she feels in her heart  that this is the best  guy for which he is a  nice guy i don't have  a problem with him  but uh you know i  just not to sound  like racist but i  think there is that  that that racial issue 
[03:26:00]  that that does come to  play we're also taught  as men as white guys  you know the old joke  like oh your daughter's  your wife's fucking a  black guy like that  becomes the punchline  because black guys are  seen in our in the  jokes as being these  virile giant cocked  fucking basketball  players who just come  in and ravage our  women but the reality  is you know all that  silliness aside he's  just probably a regular  dude that she goes to  school with and his  family will probably  give him shit so it's  if you know what i  mean it's not like 
[03:26:30]  he's like one of these  fucking all the young  buck is lining up for  the white prize like  that's that thing we  tell ourselves uh he's  probably just a nice  kid from school and um  believe me his family  will it's not just the  white families that  give them shit too the  black families do too so  he's probably having the  same issues from his  family i thank you  jimmy all right  good luck my friend  uh let's see here uh  man uh manuel emmanuel  emmanuel in oakland i  guess he's calling me  up for some boxing  gloves having trouble  dealing with a  disrespectful wife what's 
[03:27:00]  up buddy  good how are you  um nah this uh the last  couple days you know i've  been um uh trying you  know i'm trying to get  stuff together for the  next day you know get  my stuff together my  stuff together and my  wife will come at me and  be like no why are you  so why are you so mad  and you know i'm just  focused on getting my  stuff together but now  i get mad because she  brings it up right  so um yesterday she 
[03:27:30]  just got she again i  was focused on doing  what i had to do and  she just got real  disrespectful i mean  real disrespectful with  her mouth and i'm just  trying to i'm trying to  not knock her up you  know across the fucking  room yeah no you never  do not do that dude you  can't do it as a no  first of all it's wrong  you can't hit her just  because she's being a  cunt and that's you know  what i mean seriously  you can't do it um let  me ask you did you did  you know that she was  like this personality  beforehand you know  what yeah i know she  can be able to be that  but it's just it's just 
[03:28:00]  gradually just getting  worse i mean she's  she's she's more or  less in all this time  she's more or less at  this point of called me  a bitch a punk and  it's just why does she  talk to you like that  because she feels like  she can't but what did  you i'm sure you've  spoken to her about  something and what did  you say to her well  i haven't told you  know i mean i just i  shut down why you  know physical and  verbal with her because  i'll get verbal too but  i'll just walk away  because nothing good  is gonna come out of  it before we used to i  used to i used to be 
[03:28:30]  disrespectful not to  the point where she's at  now or you know we're  calling each other out of  you know out of each  other's names but um i'm  just i'm kind of done  well could you you  could a leave her b  tell her if it continues  you're gonna leave and  mean it um or c sit down  with her and go look  when we don't do it when  you're mad but say look  when we fight and you're  calling me this stuff you  know it's like i'm a  fucking man and you  think that i'm not  responding um and i'm  not a man but what do  you want to do throw the  television out the  window you want our 
[03:29:00]  kid to see that like  maybe you need to have  a discussion with her  maybe that's how her  fucking mother and  father were  i mean i'm pretty sure  it was but it's just  oh man she just got  enough her level of  respect for me shows  and uh and she's  constantly telling me  because we're getting  you know we're living  at my mom's house right  now because of the  situation of the  financial situation  okay and she gets mad  at me because you know  or you know what you  know we're not being  able to take care of  our bills but hey we  both work she's working 
[03:29:30]  but her check goes  straight to her sister  because her sister's  going through a divorce  and doesn't have any  income  okay so you know  off bat i mean how  the fuck do we do  anything when you're  over there doing what  you have to do for  your family which is  understandable but you  know what the fuck  shut the fuck up  yeah no i know it's  very frustrating you  could you again you  could talk to her and  say you don't appreciate  that or you know  yell and scream at her  or be ready to leave or  just do chip to her  that fucking nothing  annoys a woman more  than you doing chip  like no matter what she 
[03:30:00]  says don't lose your  cool just fucking do  chip every time she's  cunty if she's like  you're a bitch like  what about a female  dog  fucking home run and  just keep chipping her  until she shuts up  okay  that is my suggestion my  friend you can't hit her  but you can chip her  until she fucking leaves  i mean i really don't want  to hit her but it's just  i i there's been times  where my fifth ball up and  i'm like wow yeah i'm  already there dude i've  got i've been there i know  it's very hard sometimes  all right man well thank 
[03:30:30]  you very much okay buddy  thank you man i appreciate  it good luck mike in  texas just talk for a  second he wants to  discuss the animal hunting  opinion with me i i since  this is an advice show i  don't want to talk about it  for long um because the  show is not about that but  yes what's up mike i'll let  you be heard yeah i  understand it doesn't quite  fit within the framers  but um yeah i just want to  have a short full discourse  on this uh... i just thought  that so the way you sounded  monday you kind of took a 
[03:31:00]  whole walt disney and ignorant  approach to what big game  hunting is all about and i just  want to help set the record  straight i found that the way you  talked came more from a place of  hate than from comedy and you  were really really passionate  about this but i think it's  really misplaced hate well  hold on you're you're right  in the sense that i wasn't  being funny on our show on  the open anthony show their  show that i'm on you know  there are times where we're  attempting to be funny and  there's times we're being  very genuine and very real 
[03:31:30]  and there's times we're  combining those things and  now this is my feelings on  hunting now maybe i don't  know everything that's the  big game hunting but i don't  really need to know and i'll  tell you why this is my take  on it if she went out and  shot a lion and sat on it i  don't care if it's a lion that  she paid to shoot and then that  helps the app she's in my  opinion a cunt and i hope she's  mauled by a fucking animal if  you're a hunter and again this is 
[03:32:00]  how i hear you're a hunter and  you kill deer and you eat them  and you eat what you cook i mean  sorry what you kill you're a very  you're a braver person than i am  you're i'm a lazy guy you're  doing something i can't do and i  admire you i admire people that  actually hunt their own food  because i eat meat i just have  someone do my hunting for me so  my criticism is not aimed at  hunters who do that okay so all  you hunters that got mad at me  you're not part of the discussion 
[03:32:30]  because i'm not talking about you  i'm not attacking you big game  hunters like this idiot who's an  attention whore and then wants to  murder a fucking a very giant  animal just to sit on it and tell  people she did it i have nothing  but contempt for and i hope she's  attacked and eventually fucking  destroyed or or mauled by one of  these animals well see there's the  thing i mean you're so vehement  vehemently repulsed by what you see 
[03:33:00]  as such a morally corrupt action but  it's hard to not feel associated with  that group when you say such words  because and i know you say you  don't care but it's kind of hard not  to care because you know on average  a lion hunt in africa costs about  thirty thousand u.s dollars and big  game preserves cannot exist with  financial contributions people like  melissa bachman are prepared to make  and through her actions she actually  contributes she stimulates the local 
[03:33:30]  economy and she helps i understand  dude i i do understand that i i understand  taking lemons and making lemonade and and  the financial trickle the reality is if  she paid thirty thousand dollars to go  over there and murder a lion she's a  cunt and hold on as a hunter i'm not  talking about you i'll tell you why if  you attack thieving comedians and you  bash comedians that steal and are total 
[03:34:00]  hacks i mean i think you know i'm a good  comic and i certainly don't steal am i  supposed to be offended because i'm  also a comedian or should i go yeah  they make the rest of us look bad do  you know what i mean so no i i hunter  does not have to get emotionally  involved in what i'm saying because i'm  not attacking hunters  well the thing is you use uh words like  murder and yeah that's what that is  when you're going over there and just  doing it you are personifying and 
[03:34:30]  imparting human uh emotions and  attributes to wild animals that's  fundamentally wrong it doesn't work that  way that's why i think you take a  walt disney approach to the whole thing  and you need to understand without  people like her and her financial  contributions there's no more money  uh flooded into these kind of  reserves okay break down poachers kill  all the lines it's either it's either  you uh are satisfied with what she does  and people like her ilk do or else you 
[03:35:00]  have no lines whatsoever it's because  people like her that lines have been  saved from extinction otherwise you have  okay hey dude look i'm not gonna get  into a long animal discussion only only  because that's not what this show is so  i mean i i that's your that's your take  on it uh are you still there we didn't  hang up on you no no i'm here we gotta  let you do it i have to let you go  because it's an advice i would love to  talk to you and argue for an hour  but it's not fair but you know what i'm  saying that's your take on it my take  on it she's a pig and i hope that she's 
[03:35:30]  injured by one of these i hope an  elephant steps on her cunt and i hope  she lives through it i hope she lives  through it and has a flattened vagina  you're saying that her finances help  contribute uh to keeping a lot of lions  alive perhaps they do i still think  she's a pig because that's like saying  i pay money to go into a place and  rape a woman but a lot of the money i  use goes to a rape crisis center and  somebody compared the lion hunting to  me getting hookers well there's human 
[03:36:00]  trafficking okay play semantics games  she paid a lot of money to kill a  fucking animal i think it was a murder  because she's not eating it she's just  being a cunt so fuck her but i know you  and i have a difference of opinion okay  it's cool  and what the hell do i know just get  back to the job site  what do you know just two guys  talking lying hey i ain't lying to the  boss when i tell him i was early  all right i'll see you buddy thanks for  the call  okay let's see uh  um uh john in westchester what's my  opinion on being in a volatile  relationship other words john wants to 
[03:36:30]  say jim let's talk about every  relationship you've ever been in hi  john  hey what's up man hey all right um  yeah so that's that's basically it in a  nutshell i'm in a relationship that i  feel is probably one of the greatest  relationships i've ever been in how  long you've been with her can't stay  together more than a month and a half at  a time  hold on hold on how long you've been  with her  a year and a half  okay and um why do you guys break up  like what do you fight about in a quick  nutshell  in a nutshell uh she's rich i'm poor i have 
[03:37:00]  to work and she doesn't  why do you fight about that do you  resent that in her or does she resent  the fact you're poor  no i mean think of everything that  would be different between a rich and  a poor person  political views  upbringing uh background that could  happen between  here's what we do for fun what we  enjoy to eat i mean everything you  can think of is what we fight about  but all of those things the reason i'm  interrupting is because all of those  things can happen between two people  of the same social class no i know  there's a difference between the way  rich people live and poor people  but i mean those problems you're 
[03:37:30]  having could easily happen and  easily happen political ideologies  what you like to do how your values  are could easily happen between two  very wealthy people or two broke  people  but you have to handle that stuff  because that's a part it's like  saying well a catholic is dating a  jewish girl  you know you know you believe in one  god and she believes in another you  can't get much fundamentally  different than that  the personalities going into it are  what the problem is because if  you're both not respecting the fact  you're coming from different places  it doesn't matter that she's rich and  you're poor because if you were both 
[03:38:00]  poor you'd both be the same people  and not respect you understand what  i mean i think that's more the  problem than the financial status  no i i yeah i i understand it you  see my my thing is with it um  there's a part i'm leaving out here  okay  she's 47 almost 48 and i just turned  35  okay she's older than you cool  she's older than me  all right  um she's a feminist  okay  i listen to the opie and anthony show  is she submissive sexually by the way  do you like to spank her or she like 
[03:38:30]  her hair pulled  oh god yeah  she does yeah a lot of the  feminists are very submissive it's  really weird  because they're very dominant people  that's kind of what i feel i feel like  she's going for the cougar cup thing  she is extremely attracted to me  sexually  sure  and i feel that's what's driving her  okay  she won't admit it  now you listen to opie and anthony  she doesn't like you listening to opie and anthony  or that's not part of the equation  that's not really part of the equation  i'm just trying to point out  oh the difference okay  well you think that she only wants you 
[03:39:00]  because you're a good fuck  she won't acknowledge that thing about herself  maybe because  maybe because as a feminist  she feels like it's too masculine a mentality to have  or maybe she just doesn't like to admit that about herself  but i still don't understand why you guys aren't getting along  if you have great sex  like what is it that you  like  the problem with in relationships is we find this need to change each other's opinion  instead of disrespecting the fact  let her be a feminist  i mean i i agree with a lot of feminist views  i just don't agree with this  language bullshit they get into 
[03:39:30]  but i agree with a lot of what  what do they what does she say that you disagree with  um  well  i mean uh  i mean you know a lot of things  uh she she has children i don't  so we we battle a lot about you know  uh like her son for instance  like when her son doesn't want to do something  her opinion on it is  well  that's the way it is let it be  and my opinion on it is  no you know he's seven years old  if you don't instruct him  how to do something  he's never going to learn  do you live together 
[03:40:00]  um  no we don't live together  but i spend six out of seven days a week at her house  so it's almost like living together  but basically it's her son  so let her do what she wants  yeah  yeah  okay  no i guess what i'm trying to get out of you is  is there a way to  and i i not like the last caller  i'm not trying to punch her in the face  sure sure  is there a way to  beat the truth out of her  because i really feel like  she's just here for the dick  and she's making everything else up  and stringing me along 
[03:40:30]  well then why do you need the truth from her  if you know that  well because it's a gut feeling  okay  well usually our gut feelings are right  right  maybe you can't get the truth out of her  but maybe  why would you want to be with somebody  if you feel like you can't get real answers out of them anyway  and you know when we do have these fights  and we do go through a week or two  where we don't speak to each other  you know the first thing she does is  she runs to match.com  or you know she runs out to her last boyfriend  and she's on dates  and she's doing this and she's doing that  so it's not like we break up  and she's home crying 
[03:41:00]  and she's upset  because we're not together anymore  her first instinct is to find another man  okay well she's also older  so she's probably  she's older dude  my gut feeling is  she doesn't want to be here  and when the dick charm wears off  for a while  she's really out looking for what makes her happy  and then she realizes  she's not getting the good dick someplace else  and now she's back to me  okay well hold on  if you know all that  if you know  see you already know the answer  so sometimes we like the answer confirmed  because it validates sometimes 
[03:41:30]  but listening to what you're saying  if that's who she is  and that's what your situation is  either A. accept it  and just keep fucking her  B. sit down and say to her  look this is what I feel like is going on  and I'm leaving the relationship  if this is what it is  and then take her at face value  or C. just leave  because you know that's what it is  you don't need her to confirm it  if you already know it  you're 35 years old  like you're not a dumb guy  no  so you  especially since you know  she goes out and meets people  it goes right to match.com  so maybe you're alright 
[03:42:00]  so if you feel that  then either just enjoy the pussy  you're getting  or if you feel it's going to be too painful  and she's eventually going to leave you  then end the relationship  so you're saying go with the gut  of course  because the sick part of a relationship  is sometimes what keeps us coming back  we don't like to admit that  but sometimes when I feel numb  feeling bad is feeling something  and sometimes those volatile relationships  make us feel bad  and they make us feel lousy  but that's something  it's you know  and we talked about this 
[03:42:30]  on Opie and Anthony the other day  it's punctuating the dreariness  we kind of get a misshapen pleasure  out of feeling bad  and sometimes we're comfortable  when we're feeling bad  or feeling uncomfortable  so a lot of times  we seek that shit out  so just be honest about that  with yourself  I don't think you need her  to admit anything  no I think  alright I think you're right Jimmy  alright my friend  good luck  thanks I love you  alright thank you  and make sure you fuck her again  alright let's see  this is interesting  Jordan Florida  is having a daughter  and he's terrified  of wiping her vagina 
[03:43:00]  hi Jordan  what's up Jimmy  how are you  what's up Jimmy  hey buddy  good how you doing  thank you  is this your first daughter  yeah it's my first daughter  I have a son  and you know  I'm very involved  with my son  changing this and that  it's all fine  sure  but in talking with my wife  about the baby  coming up  the girl  I'm just like  look I want you to know  I'm very uncomfortable  changing her  and wiping her vagina  let me ask you a question  and Louis CK  did a joke about this 
[03:43:30]  about the daughter  getting shit in her pussy  or something  when he was wiping it  Opie would be more qualified  to answer this  or any other guy  who has a daughter  about that they've changed  but from what I'm told  you know  of course  because you don't want  to ever  are you afraid  you might sexualize her  or you're afraid  that it might scar her  mentally  to have her father  doing that  I'm not worried  I'm worried about her  I'm worried about me  like I just feel  like a pedophile  or like for some reason  just wiping a vagina  even with my own daughter  do you know what  it's because we're  we're now so 
[03:44:00]  pedo  oriented  and we're so obsessed  with pedophilia  and protecting kids  which is good  we probably should be  that even something  totally innocent  like  and this may have been  happening forever  for fathers and daughters  but I think  if you're changing  your daughter  and she's a baby  and you wipe her vagina  I think that's a  perfectly legit  contact  and you know  I think it's a  completely unsexual  and fatherly thing  to do  so I think that  maybe it's the 
[03:44:30]  circumstances around us  and this constant  obsession over  child molesting  and child touching  that's got all that  on our heads  so even appropriate  and healthy things  seem inappropriate  and unhealthy  like  I'm more self-conscious  talking to a kid  now than I ever was  like I was never  self-conscious  talking to a kid  but I'm self-conscious  now  like what if  somebody walking by  sees me talking  to this kid  and thinks something  which is  different than  what you're talking  about  but it's the same  in that I'm letting  all this  it's the same thing  and it actually 
[03:45:00]  makes you more  of a normal person  if you feel that  awkwardness  wiping your daughter's  vagina  or talking to a kid  because  then you have  on the other side  the people that do it  that completely  don't think it's weird  at all  and I think those people  are more fucked up  than you and I  well I don't think  that wiping  your daughter's vagina  should make you feel  weird  just because  it's a very parental  thing to do  it's almost like  wiping their mouth  or wiping  you know what I mean  it's something  you're simply  doing something  that they cannot  do for themselves  what if you're wiping  somebody else's 
[03:45:30]  kid's vagina  like would you feel  weird  I absolutely  would feel weird  but again  if I was a parent  or if I was a  fucking 50 year old  parent and I had  you know  five kids  and I was wiping  somebody else's  kid's ass  I probably wouldn't  feel weird  like I would be  I would be weird  wiping a boy's ass  any child  I don't want to  fucking see him naked  I don't want to  touch their shitty  bodies  but you know  I think it all  is relative to your  experience  you know again  a parent  how come a mother  shouldn't feel weird  wiping her son  like you know 
[03:46:00]  how many moms  my wife said  yeah  believe me  most mothers  out there  can grab any  fucking kid  by the ankles  and scoop out  his asshole  with a fucking  paper  because they don't  think twice about it  because it's a  motherly or  protective or  nurturing thing  to do  and my wife  funny you said  my wife told me  the other day  she took a shower  with my son  and I was like  that's disgusting  because his head  is just right by  your fucking pussy  well he's lucky  what  I said if he's lucky  sorry  I'm just making  a little incest joke 
[03:46:30]  sorry  oh yeah  alright buddy  thanks  oh no  don't be mad  alright buddy  good luck  I would say  listen to Louis CK's  or talk to a dad  with a daughter  maybe that's pretty normal  I guess because most  pedos are men by the way  most pedophiles are men  so maybe that's why  we feel more self-conscious  because with women  it's always been acceptable  and now this whole  you know  stay at home dad  and dad taking care  of the kids thing  is you know  a more recent phenomenon  in the human psyche  so maybe we don't know  how to handle it  but it's totally 
[03:47:00]  fucking normal dude  to wipe your daughter  alright  good luck my friend  let's see  we only have  a few minutes left  now Doug in Syracuse  his job is making it hard  to stay in love  with a girl  what do you do  do you work at Weight Watchers  no I own a restaurant  and it's been taking  like all the time  of my day  it's been these 15 hour days  and before I had that  I had a job 
[03:47:30]  where I could spend  a lot of time  with my girlfriend  and now my girlfriend  kind of has to work  at the restaurant  all the time  it's not like we fight  from spending too much  time together  at the restaurant  or anything  it's just  now we're both  exhausted all the time  we're not taking care  of each other  we're not really  sleeping together  and we fight about money  all the time  because you know  if the restaurant  doesn't do good  we don't have any money  and she doesn't make  a lot of money  outside with her own job  so it's just a lot  of stress on me  and I'm like  just not feeling 
[03:48:00]  very happy about  anything  how long  you've been together  three years  okay so it's like  you're just too much  familiarity  the specialness of it  or the high of it  has gone  being around somebody  at work all day  and then at home  it's probably really  tough too though  I think because  you get no break  from that person  so does she have to  work at the restaurant  can she work  somewhere else  no we don't have  any money  and like  I need her to work  some ships  to save money  or I can't  like make the rent 
[03:48:30]  on the store  and on the  I can't make the  mortgage on the house  okay  like I mean like  it's a lot of work  I gotta be there  all the time  and she has a job  where she works  about 30 hours  for her job  and like  she's just gonna have  to pull in like  20 hours  at the place  or we're just  not gonna have money  well 20  I mean I guess  that's a lot  of your work  that's four hours  a day  for five days  but  yeah  I have her 
[03:49:00]  broken down  that she just  basically works  on the weekends  later she pulls  just two like  eight hour ships  on the weekend  are you there  on the weekends  yeah  oh you do  okay  well if you know  it's only temporary  why don't I just  deal with it  until you don't  have to deal  with it anymore  I mean if it's  temporary  just to get  your bills paid  what's that  it's not really  temporary  it's more like  this is like  how it is  unless it makes  more money  or unless  I am able  to save more  money to like  open another  restaurant  or open  another  business  I mean 
[03:49:30]  this is  this is it  this is how  much money  I make  how big  is your  restaurant  it's just  a small  restaurant  it's just  this is  what I own  how does  she feel  about it  she's kind  of bummed  because she  would have  liked I think  if my previous  career had  worked better  which was  what  but  I had  been a  lawyer  okay  but  she  is  she's  being  very  supportive  and  she  is  doing  whatever  she  needs  to 
[03:50:00]  do  to  make  this  work  because  you know  I'm the one  bringing in  all the money  and you know  and she loves  me to death  and I do  love her a lot  but like  I'll listen to  like your  advice show  about like  things  that like  couples need  to be like  doing  and like  we're not  having  like any  sex  and we're  not  I mean  we're not  really doing  anything  we're trying  to go  out  as much  as we  can  just  to do  stuff  but  it's  exhausting  and  sometimes  I kind  of resent  her  because 
[03:50:30]  I'm like  you know  if I was  single  I would  just  focus  on the  business  more  and  you know  what  your distractions  would be  otherwise  because you'd  have some  fucking  crazy  flake  of a  girlfriend  coming  into your  restaurant  and screaming  at you  in front  of your  customers  you know  what  at least  you know  that she's  a contributor  and she's  not some  flaky  dipshit  at least  she's  working  and putting  you know  money  and putting  her time  into it  I mean  you got  a good  woman  if she's  doing that  she's not  some fucking  flighty cunt  who's just  spending all 
[03:51:00]  your money  so maybe  you have to  weigh the  the negatives  like okay  we spend  too much  time together  and we're  both a little  too tired  for sex  so we should  make some  more effort  to fuck  maybe I  should eat  her ass  at the end  of the shift  make her feel  appreciated  but at least  you're not  dating some  lazy shit  who's screaming  at you  because you're  working too much  and then you're  worried she's  out fucking  some other guy  because you're  working  that's true  I've never  had to worry  about her  being a father  guy  she is totally  into me  and you know 
[03:51:30]  when it comes  to the sex  she's always  been about me  and keeping me  happy  and I appreciate  all that stuff  lately I guess  I've been feeling  selfish  and honestly  when you say  it like that  I sound like  a total dick  you know  it's not like  a dick  but just  make sure  that you focus  on that part  and that  it's probably  normal  you get a little  stir crazy  and like alright  but the options  because it's a  business  that's a  small business  you're always  gonna have to  put a lot of  hours in  to make it  work  so you're  never just  gonna be able  to fucking  have a nine  to five  until you get 
[03:52:00]  another place  open too  and you're  kind of like  a mogul  and you oversee  them  so for now  this is your  situation  dating would be  a lot harder  and yeah  oh the sex  would be fresher  until you can't  meet her two  weekends in a row  because there's  something happening  at work  and then she's  a cunt  and then she's  banging somebody  else in your  life's in turmoil  so at least  here you have  something consistent  and it's not  interfering with  your business  that's true  alright  that's really true  good luck you  little sweet potato  and we only have  a couple of  minutes left  alright so let's 
[03:52:30]  just say a couple  of guys  I'm not even  gonna go to  these guys  I just wanna  read there  one guy Robert  says he had  the same issue  about wiping  his daughter  you just have  to go with it  and then Paul  in Arkansas  says if wiping  your daughter  makes you feel  weird have your  wife be in the  room with you  so maybe these  are two possible  solutions from  these guys  and one guy  Phil in Queens  says chipping your  wife is fantastic  he does to his  all the time  I appreciate  that and I  think that's  great advice  oh no Zach  in South Carolina  let's talk to him  just for a minute  married for 10  years cheated  and the guilt  is keeping him 
[03:53:00]  up at night  hi Zach  I was hoping  you wouldn't  call on me  oh hi buddy  yeah yeah  you said it all  10 years  great great  marriage great  everything  and yeah I  did it this  weekend  oh it's just  this weekend  okay so 10  years  now who's the  girl not who  is she but have  you slurred with  her before  uh yeah  you know flirting  and all those  things that uh to  make sure you still  got it you know  I've always you  always push the  envelope just to  make sure you're  still a human and  make sure you still 
[03:53:30]  can but you know  you always once you  feel like the  battle's won you  back off and you're  and you're fine with  that so you fucked  are you gonna fuck  this girl again  yeah uh logic tells  me no but uh you  know well let me ask  you do you and your  wife still have sex  absolutely yeah so  the thing is this dude  10 years you're  married I think that  people probably get  restless and again  this day and age with  technology and facebook  and twitter and emails  and texting there's so  many ways to communicate  all the time it's really 
[03:54:00]  harder to stay faithful  but I think that you  should take the hint that  your mind is giving you  you cheated and you feel  bad about it and you're  staying up at night so  maybe you have to realize  that you fucked up and  you got away with one you  don't need to go out and  do it and do it and do  it until you get caught  because that eventually  will happen it's going to  probably ruin your  marriage so why not just  fucking take the one  little victory you got  fuck it I got away with  it and realize I don't  feel good about it I know 
[03:54:30]  I feel guilty and I'm  staying up at night and  thank god I didn't fuck  up my marriage over it  because if you feel  guilty after the first  time dude take that as a  sign oh yeah yeah I feel  like I mean literally the  hands are my hands are  shaking like Michael J  fucked all the time I'm  just like I'm just a  disaster and you know  and I'm I'm paranoid and  all this other stuff at  the same time like that  was it was awesome it  always is you know what  eating cake is really  great and I love eating  cake but then I hate when  I pinch my side fat there's 
[03:55:00]  a lot of things that are  really fun but the price  for them makes them not  worth it stealing is fun I  love to see but I haven't  stolen in 25 or 30 years  because the getting caught  is not fun so a lot of  times you know what's fun  is not always the answer  getting high can be fun but  I can't do it because  there's always the next  day there's always  consequences so do the  consequences are not worth  it it's not worth it and  you already feel guilty  that's a bad sign so just  take you got away with it  be grateful you got away 
[03:55:30]  with it don't be greedy and  push your luck like the  most of us would would do  god damn it you know how  right you are you're you're  I know you're right you're  right just enjoy the memory  and go look I betrayed  somebody I really loved I  should not have done that  but here's how I'll comfort  myself I won't do it again  okay and this will buy me  years of jerking off just  thinking absolutely do it  and eventually something's  gonna happen it's negative  and you don't need that  shit just take the one good  memory and don't do it  again you got it buddy you're  awesome all right take care  you godless cheater bye all 
[03:56:00]  right sorry I couldn't get to  the guy who had wants to  break it off with his girl  you know the best way to do  it is just jerk off on one  of her friends in the car  that will help you break  up with her the response to  the guy who's a daughter  wants to do the black I  try next week and of course  Ray wants to know how  I'll perform at his comedy  club Ray I just did the  comedy work so I cannot and  I won't be up at Albany  for at least a year but  thank you for the call I  appreciate it and good luck  with your club you know  because it would be a gift  though if I performed and
