<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a jarring introduction by Larry King, followed by complaints from Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton about the low volume of their intro music.  The main focus quickly shifted to Christian Lopez, the fan who caught Derek Jeter's 3000th home run ball and returned it.  The hosts launched into a furious, profanity-laced tirade against the IRS and the US tax system, highlighting the significant tax burden on Lopez due to the Yankees' gift of luxury seats.  This sparked a broader discussion about various taxes (gift, income, property, luxury), interspersed with political commentary, personal anecdotes about financial struggles (including credit card debt and IRS audits), and a recurring, crude joke about "peas" as a euphemism for government actions.  Callers shared similar experiences with taxes on gifted items and luxury goods.  The discussion briefly touched upon comedian Vic Henley and his alleged acquaintance with George W. Bush. One host even started writing a song about loving New York despite its high taxes. A caller contrasted Lopez's optimistic outlook with the grim reality of a friend battling stage four cancer.

The show continued with further tax-related grievances, including humorous anecdotes about excessive taxation on luxury goods and a caller, Matt, recounting his childhood use of a tax-exempt form for his family's church.  Other tax-related complaints included the NYC commuter tax and taxes on game show winnings, with Sam Roberts sharing a personal anecdote about paying taxes on his Nickelodeon prizes.  The conversation then abruptly shifted to predatory high-interest, short-term loans advertised on television, particularly those featuring Montel Williams. Callers shared their negative experiences with these loans.  Christian Lopez's mother, Catherine, called in to discuss her son's situation, expressing concerns about the tax implications and safety risks. The segment concluded with a comedic tangent about the repetitive songs from *Yo Gabba Gabba!*, with the hosts and callers mocking their simplistic nature and speculating about the show's impact on children.

The next segment started with a bizarre discussion of a video depicting foreskin manipulation, followed by a nonsensical chant about body parts.  The conversation then circled back to *Yo Gabba Gabba!* and Jack Black's appearance, leading to darkly humorous wishes of harm upon various individuals.  Leslie was introduced as a guest, performing a ridiculous dance called "Razzle Dazzle" with DJ Rora and the Junior Gems.  The hosts then discussed the children's book *Go the Fuck to Sleep*, playing an excerpt read by Sam Jackson.  The hosts' bosses' African safari became a topic, with humorous speculation about their activities.  The conversation returned to *Yo Gabba Gabba!*, specifically a song about clitoral circumcision, and continued with various humorous tangents. A heated discussion ensued with a caller, Coop, who accused the show of racism.  Coop argued that certain jokes were unacceptable, while the hosts defended their comedy and questioned the power dynamics related to race, touching upon themes of white supremacy, slavery, colonialism, and racial disparities in power.  The segment ended with a puppet dance segment, commentary on hunting practices (criticizing trophy hunting and praising subsistence hunting), and a surprise appearance by Chris Evans (Captain America).  There was also mention of a prank video involving Robert Kelly and one of the hosts almost falling over a railing.


Chris Evans, promoting *Captain America: The First Avenger*, was interviewed in-studio.  He discussed his initial reluctance to sign a nine-movie deal, the film's tone, the use of Nazis as antagonists, and the extensive CGI.  The conversation covered his past roles (including *Not Another Teen Movie*), early career struggles, a funny anecdote about stealing a Captain America comic book, and awkward film premieres.  Other topics included an incident of vandalism at the Ed Sullivan Theater, Hayley Atwell's attractiveness, the hosts' drinking habits and blackouts (with promises of future discussions), and 7-Eleven's free Slurpee day.  The interview was punctuated with profanity and ended with praise for Evans and teases for upcoming segments.

The final segment revisited a 2007 broadcast.  The hosts discussed their anxieties about air travel and 757 maintenance before recounting a past show event where comedian Louis Twitchell Santani licked cake off another man's testicles.  They then jokingly suggested that "Duffy" perform a similar act; after initial reluctance, Duffy participated, and the hosts graphically described the event.  The segment concluded with the "This Day in O&A" tagline.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show  right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it. The thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard, you know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mind?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about,  and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio,  but I'm still proud to answer it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, you're good.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony Radio Show.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Good morning. 
[00:01:00]  Good morning.  Good morning.  I've got to find my head full of things.  The rage is nice and low again today.  Yeah, I like it like that.  It's not very overpowering.  Yeah, it's just...  It doesn't really kick our in and wake people up.  And we don't want to be too much higher in the mix,  so we should talk like this to start today's show.  No, we shouldn't be intrusive this early.  So we might as well just get rid of Rage Against the Machine at this point  if we're going to play it this low.  Yeah, yeah.  The whole philosophy behind it was that we hit these fuckers right between the eyes 
[00:01:30]  with some music before we come on.  Yeah, this is like...  But someone in that other room has decided it needs to be very soft.  Very soft.  This is like uncomfortable with the machine.  Yes.  It's not really Rage.  It's just a little discomfort.  Remember any W when we were doing Afternoon Drive?  All of a sudden, you just knew it was time for us  because that music kicked in nice and loud.  And then we had to almost yell over it to say, 
[00:02:00]  yes, we're here to broadcast.  I'd rather keep things lower now.  It's just nice.  And we talk about it every day,  and they continue to keep it nice and low in the midst.  You're on.  Because no one gives a fuck around here.  It's just nice that way.  Whose problem is it today?  If it goes any higher, we can't hear you at all.  Oh, hey.  Oh, hey.  What do I do?  Face.  Are you trying to say it sounds good out there in radio land?  It sounds fine in here. 
[00:02:30]  That's why I don't understand why it's so loud.  As long as you're enjoying it.  Sure.  And I noticed how you haven't raised your voice  as you discuss this with us.  So I guess it is fine.  I feel like I'm on NPR, you asshole.  Turn this fucking thing off.  Yeah, see?  Yeah, that's better.  We like that.  Hey.  Because it kind of forces you to, you know.  Obi and Anthony show.  Exactly.  Here it is.  It's too loud, though.  Good morning, everybody.  It's too loud.  Personally, I like it like this. 
[00:03:00]  Maybe you should bother people with this.  It's hurting.  It's hurting.  I like it.  I like it like it's a nice hum.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm going to give this another fucking shot  because I got killed on Twitter by, I would have to say, a minority,  but their voices were heard, certainly.  Minority?  What did he say?  A minority of people.  Oh.  This Derek Jeter fucking home run ball that was his 3,000th hit. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  I'm arguing with a few people out there who's like, no, this guy did the right thing.  Yeah.  Sometimes you've got to do the right thing.  That was my school of thought if you listened to yesterday's show.  You were kind of quiet about it because when we were discussing this this morning,  I was surprised that you really felt like this guy should have just handed over the ball.  My take was the guy's take.  It was like, hey, Jeter worked for this his entire career.  Right. 
[00:04:00]  And he's the one that hit it out.  Right.  And I thought, it's his ball.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  If he cared that much about the 3,000th hit, why not hit a single?  Your turn.  All right.  Your turn.  I never really.  Your turn.  I didn't really think of it in that respect.  The home run wasn't that important.  The 3,000.  Right.  Thank you.  So if he really gave his shit about the ball, he would have made sure he didn't hit a home run. 
[00:04:30]  Your turn, asshole.  That's true.  A blooper.  You know.  A bunch of.  Go over, over center fielder's head, maybe.  Right.  Drops in behind him.  All right.  I kind of.  Wow.  I didn't even think of that.  See, then there's no controversy.  It's guaranteed he gets the ball back because the players were handed over.  You know.  Sure.  They're all about that.  That's pretty fucking funny.  You know what?  I used to be that guy.  Yeah.  I've changed. 
[00:05:00]  A long time ago, too.  So that's why there's no surprise in this room.  But I used to be that guy that thought about tradition.  Thought about, yeah, it would be the right thing to do.  Uh-huh.  It's not always about money and fame and this and that.  It's just, just do the right thing.  Well, I changed my tune from yesterday.  But in sports, they fuck over the fans all the time.  Exactly.  They fuck them over.  And the players don't give a fuck about the individual fan.  No.  They really don't.  No.  The players switch uniforms like it's nothing. 
[00:05:30]  Like it's us changing our underwear.  Once a month.  Yeah.  They don't care.  So why should we care in that position?  After I heard this morning on the news.  Yeah.  We're going to add to the story in a second.  Yeah.  That this guy.  Wait.  Yeah.  No, because we're going to move forward with the story.  But I'm confused by you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I thought you would be.  He likes boys and girls.  I thought you would be the guy in the room that really would be like, fuck, you know, 
[00:06:00]  fuck Derek Jeter, fuck the Yankees.  You know, you should get as much out of it as you can.  I'm surprised by your take.  I was definitely looking at it as, you know, I agreed.  The guy, Jeter, he worked at it.  He got it.  And, you know, since he did hit a home run and went into the stands, this guy was cool  from just about just giving it to him.  And, you know, that's part of his entire illustrious career. 
[00:06:30]  So why not just give it to him?  And then the Yankees were pretty good, giving the guy a bunch of shit there.  Looks like fat stinky.  He looks like young Garrett, but all blown up.  He does.  What was the quote from that mob movie about Mickey Mantle?  Uh, oh, yeah, that was from, oh, that was from a bronchist tale.  A bronchist tale.  Bronchist tale.  But does anyone know?  Louie Beans.  Give me the ball. 
[00:07:00]  Doesn't anyone remember that quote?  And that was the mindset when Mickey Mantle was playing.  Yeah, yeah.  Mickey Mantle's not going to pay your rent or something like that.  What's, I don't know the exact quote.  I don't know the quote either.  Someone might.  But it's similar to what happened here.  Oh, tell Mickey Mantle your father can't pay his rent.  See what he says.  Yeah.  Something like that.  That's Master Queef.  Thank you, Master Queef.  Yeah.  Basically saying, why do we care so much when they don't?  Yeah, why give a shit?  They don't care about the individual. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  But now you've turned, now that we got more info on this guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Now, because it just shows that everybody's out to fuck everyone else up the ass.  So, so fuck everyone else up the ass.  Well, we learned yesterday this kid owed $100,000 in student loans, right?  Right.  And he could have paid it off by just selling the ball.  And that's my reason.  Like, just sell the ball and have a nice, clean fucking slate there.  Yeah.  As far as what you owe.  A fan who handed over Derek Jeter's historic 3,000th hit ball will owe IRS thousands. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  This is America right here.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is that really a sickening?  Ugh.  The fucking government is just sickening.  They gotta get their mitts in there.  Get your mitts in.  And someone should explain this to this kid before he made his decision, by the way.  Because we know this shit's going down, and a bunch of people know this shit goes down.  This kid did not know. 
[00:08:30]  I bet you the Yankee or Jeter pays the taxes for him.  Well, I haven't seen Jeter do anything for the kid personally yet.  And then what about the tax money?  Like, isn't that taxable?  Like, I don't get how that works.  Like, if you pay...  They're saying the Yankees gave him upwards of about $50,000 worth of merchandise tickets,  shit like that, which he would probably owe close to $14,000 in taxes on.  This kid owes $14,000.  So, if they give him $14,000 for taxes, isn't that just tagged on to the original? 
[00:09:00]  Oh, I thought you were saying that the ball, because that's considered a gift.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  On the estimated value of the ball.  On the fucking merch they gave him?  Yes.  Oh, the government just...  Can you imagine that?  Jinks!  So, if you find yourself in the outfield and there's one of these special balls, just  fucking don't touch it.  Let it just sit there.  This kid went to a baseball game and now he owes up to $14,000.  How you doing?  For doing the right thing.  I think the guy that fell on his head did better off when he went to the game. 
[00:09:30]  Here's the story.  The fan who handed over Dirk Jeter's $3,000 hit ball will owe the IRS thousands.  Tax Pro said Monday, Christian Lopez, 23, will probably be on the hook for between $5,000  and $13,000 because of the luxury seats the Grateful Yankees gave him, the accountant said.  See, you can't just get something nice anymore.  No, no, you can't get something.  The government decided a long time ago, wow, we could tax that shit and make more money  off the people.  Game show people?  People, they have to pay the taxes on everything they win. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  It used to be you just won.  It used to be you just won.  Eh.  You get a new boat, a new fucking car on Let's Make a Deal.  You didn't have to pay for the taxes.  Lottery.  You got to pay a UN lotto, lottery, anything you win, you got to pay a huge percentage of.  I love when you hear that shit.  It's like, and the couple won $300 million after taxes and taking the full thing, the lump  sum and stuff.  They have about $3 million.  Yeah.  It's like, wait, what?  What happened? 
[00:10:30]  Which will be paid out over the next 25 years.  So it turns out you get like, you know, $5,000 a month.  He's still got to do his janitor job.  Right.  What happened?  The government just teaches you that you should fuck them.  Like, why would you, why deal with them straight when they're going to put their dick in you  every single minute of the day?  You got to watch, you know, you got to watch the politicians.  I'm not even going to say who, what, where, when, or whatever, but you got to watch them  say that you're not doing enough and you're not doing your share.  That's the way they drill it into your fucking head so that in a couple of years when they 
[00:11:00]  tax you more, you don't fucking start a revolution with your pals.  You just pay the fucking thing like the sheep we are.  Pay it.  Pay it.  How many fucking notices are you going to send me?  These motherfuckers every goddamn month.  Another one that they want.  Just want more money from 2006 or 2008 because they can't read my fucking interest that I  paid on my house.  That was that thing that I was, I was talking about. 
[00:11:30]  They said, after a thorough investigation, uh, we realized, Mr. Comey, you owe us upwards  of, you know, $30,000.  I was like, what?  So I get on the phone with my accountant and, uh, he got in touch with the, the, the guy,  the, the examiner.  And it turned out the guy goes, yeah, um, yeah, we couldn't read that form you sent over,  uh, for the interest that he paid on his house.  Oh, so a thorough investigation is we can't read it. 
[00:12:00]  Pay us.  That's thorough enough.  What does that say?  That we'll just assume you didn't pay anything in interest the whole year on your house.  So pay us.  Wouldn't, wouldn't there be another, wouldn't there be a better copy of that somewhere?  Exactly.  I said, blow that fucking thing up to the size of one of those giant checks, those publishers  clearing house checks and throw it at the fucking guy's fuck face and say he paid.  There's no receipt that you're paying.  Of course there is. 
[00:12:30]  There's plenty of shit.  So what the fuck are they doing?  Well, that's what happened.  My accountant then asked for it.  I was like, okay.  Here you go.  And send him another one.  But don't you think the IRS could go, hey, um, I got something here.  I can't read it.  Can you send me another copy?  Instead of going, can't read it.  Pay us again.  Pay more.  More, more.  Pay, pay.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  God damn it.  The tree of liberty. 
[00:13:00]  The tree of liberty.  I'm kind of hoping our country goes broke so we can start over.  Oh, God, please.  Just start over.  Start over.  You think they're going to let us keep our money?  Do over.  I don't care.  I don't care as long as they let us keep our guns.  Yeah, I don't care.  And they ain't going to let us.  I can live in the woods.  No problem.  I don't care.  Money's not everything.  Fucking revolution, motherfuckers.  God, I'm sick of it.  So this kid, uh, might be on the hook for five to $13,000.  But that's only a possible. 
[00:13:30]  That's only speculation by a tax expert.  Yeah, but you know what?  This is pretty accurate.  They probably will.  It's probably more.  He's a great guy, says Terry Ganner.  A diehard Yankees fan and accountant for blah, blah, and blah, blah.  But I'm pretty sure the tax man, unfortunately, is not a Yankee fan and will not look at this  so sympathetically.  Lopez says he'll pay, but he wouldn't mind a little help.  Now this guy's in debt.  More debt.  That's the lady.  He's got a big, he's got his big smile on his face with his big new Yankee hat on. 
[00:14:00]  That's like, wait a minute.  That's before the, that's before the tax cock.  Jesus Christ.  Get a picture of him after the tax cock got him.  Worst comes to worst, I'll have to pay the taxes, he told the Daily News.  I'm not going to return the seats.  I have a lot of family and friends who will help me out if need be.  Oh, he's going to have to fucking, he's going to have to fucking go to his family and go,  you want those seats?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm going to need like a couple hundred bucks here.  And he has to collect money from his own family.  I got to pay for these seats.  So in the end, what do the Yankees do?  What do the Yankees do for this guy?  He owes money. 
[00:14:30]  What did, what did they do for him?  We are in a fucked place.  We really are.  We've let ourselves, we've let ourselves be sheep and be herded into the most fucked place  in this country by these sheep herding fucking politician cocksuckers.  And that's where we are.  I hate them all.  You could, you could say, you could say Democrat all you want.  No, no.  I fucking hate them all across the board.  You know what? 
[00:15:00]  Across the fucking board.  One side might be better than the other side, but I don't give a fuck.  There's probably one or two decent guys that mean well on both sides of the aisle.  But for the most part, Barney Frank.  Barney Frank.  You know, wants to reach out, grab on, and give a good tug.  How bad does Barney Frank want to reach out and grab?  I hope he doesn't have old gay man breath.  There's a certain breath that comes with older men.  Old gay man breath.  How do you know that? 
[00:15:30]  That's kind of weird.  I know a couple.  I'm chatted with a few.  A couple of queens.  The whole country's falling apart and they joke about it by using the term peas.  Oh, with the peas.  We're all going to have to eat our peas.  I like peas.  Yeah?  I never minded peas.  I don't mind the peas.  But I don't want to have to pay for 20 fucking cases of them so everyone else can eat their  fucking peas. 
[00:16:00]  You got it?  Who's doing the pea bit, you think?  I can afford my peas.  It's time to eat your peas.  Let someone else eat their peas.  Who's doing the peas?  I know there's not a lot of morning jocks left, but one morning jock out there is doing  some kind of pea bit.  Can you look into that, Sam?  Are people still doing wackiness like that?  Are they going to the courthouse or the statehouse or whatever the fuck the house is?  Hey, we're going to have a pea-eating contest in front of the statehouse coming up on Tuesday.  On Tuesday, we're going to be blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:16:30]  So.  Had it.  What's important shit?  When is Casey Anthony getting out?  Uh, today.  You don't want to eat your peas?  17th, right?  I don't want to eat my peas.  We're not going to have to eat our peas.  I've been eating it with a giant government spoon served up my asshole.  I'm tired of it.  Isn't that an annoying note?  Eating shit.  It implies that you haven't been eating your peas every fucking year.  You know what?  How about this?  You're taking 90% of the peas and throwing it to other countries, dumping it in the water, 
[00:17:00]  fucking giving it to 20 people that you could just give it to one.  How about you cut back?  They don't fucking talk about cutting back their own goddamn jobs.  It's always about raising taxes or let's cut services on this or that or the other thing.  How about you take five of you motherfuckers that are doing the same job and get rid of four of yous  and have the one do the fucking job?  Well, that's crazy.  You'll never fucking see that happen. 
[00:17:30]  That's crazy.  Because, again, they've herded us in this place.  Cray cray!  Where we just look around and go,  Okay, this is the way it's worked for fucking enough years.  I guess it's got to work this way.  Either tax and spend or cut our services.  Can we get back to the Jeter ball?  Because the next line...  Jeter balls?  Yeah.  You're right.  The next line is driving me nuts.  This guy's nice guy attitude is driving me insane.  Oh, he's the worst.  Oh, really?  So now it comes out. 
[00:18:00]  He has $100,000 in student loans, so he should have fucking sold the ball just to fucking break even with that.  And now he gets the luxury seats from the Yankees.  So now he owes taxes on that, $5,000 to $13,000.  So now he's in the hole for just going to the game and catching the ball, right?  Yeah.  I don't care he gets to see the games from nice seats at Yankee Stadium.  The guy's in the hole.  And this is what he has to say about it.  The IRS has a job to do, so I'm not going to hold it against them.  But it would be cool if they helped me out a little on this. 
[00:18:30]  And that's why this guy is a dummy.  It'll be cool.  Oh, really?  Why don't you call the IRS and go, hey, can you help me out on this and see what they say to you?  I'm sorry.  They'll probably hang up on you.  Please press 1 so we may start an investigation on you.  Great.  Thanks.  They're not cool.  No.  This is not just having a job to do.  Sticking their fucking hand down your throat every turn.  This is not doing their jobs.  They said every turn.  And this is never, never what they were supposed to do. 
[00:19:00]  It's like if a cop pulls you over and just starts breaking your balls and fishing for shit.  He's not doing his job.  Wait a minute.  But that's not doing his job.  That's being a ball breaker.  That's going above and beyond.  That's what this is doing.  This guy, he's got to get rid of those, what do they say, rose-colored glasses or whatever?  Yes.  Enough already, dude.  You're just stupid.  He's a young kid.  He's still full of piss and vinegar.  Thinks he's got the world by the balls. 
[00:19:30]  Now he understands the IRS has a job to do.  A job to do.  You're the only person in America that understands the IRS has a job to do.  The rest of us curse them at every turn.  Get yourself a good job from your education that you're still paying your student loan off on.  And start making some good money.  And then see how much you think the IRS is doing this great job.  By the way, thanks for reminding me.  I've got to pay my insanely high property taxes before August 1st.  Yeah.  For what?  For what? 
[00:20:00]  So I could have a minor league ball team in my county?  Wow, that's what I need.  Hey, slow down.  We need a new stadium for the Islanders.  Fuck, I know.  It's all lumped into one thing now.  All right.  Hey, we want to keep the Islanders around for another generation of shit?  Of hopes and dreams and nothingness?  Whoa!  Are you voting yes?  Sorry, I'll find another team.  Are you voting yes?  I'm voting no.  I am a Nassau County resident.  I am in on this vote, and I am voting go fuck your mother on this fucking stadium and 
[00:20:30]  on the new arena and the Islanders and this minor league softball team.  You can't do that.  Whatever the fuck they are.  We have a voice.  We can get a lot of people to vote yes.  Yeah, I got a voice.  No, don't do that.  John Ching, pull that lever for fuck you.  I don't want to sit in those shitty seats anymore.  Fuck that.  The plastic is hurting my ass.  Fuck that shit.  No, don't do this to me.  I want better streets.  I want fucking potholes filled.  Oh, really?  Fuck that.  Oh, yeah, I know.  Believe me. 
[00:21:00]  When you vote no, that's going to happen?  Oh, I know.  Really?  It ain't going there, either.  Yeah.  What do you think?  I'm going to pay for 20 levels of redundancy on construction?  I love what bridge was I on.  I think it was the tri-barrow.  I went into a hole, and I'm thinking to myself, who thinks this is okay?  Day after day to have this massive hole that cars are going through.  It's not even a dunk-dunk.  No.  It's a boom.  You're almost bottoming out.  Yeah.  Day after day, as you pay the toll, I forgot what it is because I have easy pass. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, yeah.  And they're not fixing this thing.  It doesn't get fixed.  We're just fucking cheating.  Or when they do fix the pothole on some of these entrances to the fucking bridges or whatever,  they make it a big lump?  Yeah, that's so it lasts for a while.  We couldn't figure out how to smooth that down.  They do that so it lasts for a little while.  And then you get airborne.  But still, you're hitting the bump just the other way.  It's ridiculous.  Ah, the whole fucking world.  Ah, it's just fucked. 
[00:22:00]  So Lopez, a Verizon customer sales rep, caught the home run ball on Saturday and gifted it,  no strings attached, to Jeter.  Wait, if he gifted it to Jeter.  Yeah.  See, he should get a tax lawyer.  That ball had value.  Right.  I wonder if Jeter has to pay the taxes on the ball now, if someone estimated how much that  ball costs.  And now that it's Jeter's, if Jeter has to pay the taxes on it.  I wonder if it works both ways. 
[00:22:30]  I don't know.  How can you, I don't think you could gift something with no strings attached.  Unless it's not considered a gift and considered that it was his property that this gentleman  picked up and gave back to him.  No, man.  How is it working only one way?  Either way, this ball had value.  So if he's handing it over to Jeter, Jeter has to pay the taxes on that value.  Yeah, but it's saying if the ball is Jeter's in the first place.  Who knows more about this?  If the ball's Jeter's in the first place. 
[00:23:00]  But it's not his.  It might be Major League Baseball's, officially.  How is it his?  Maybe it's only worth the original value of the ball itself.  Oh my God.  Like he's got to pay tax on $3.95.  Oh my God.  For the baseball.  Who knows more about this?  Who was listening to talk radio?  It was a sports talk.  I don't know what the value of the ball is, but somebody's going to pay.  Give me a pretty big tax bill.  I don't like getting too personal on this show, but when you're in a position like we 
[00:23:30]  are, you try to help family members out.  And our problem is you can't give them too much money or either they or you owe the taxes  on that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So we know a lot about this gifting thing.  Yeah.  It's a pain in the ass.  It really is a pain in the ass.  You can't just help out family members like the old days because the IRS looks at that  shit too.  You're allowed to give them a certain amount without, you know, whatever.  That's where I want to stop.  But if you give them more past that, then it gets pretty complicated. 
[00:24:00]  What is the amount that in this country you can give without being taxed?  10 G's.  About 10 G's.  And after 10 grand, they tax it?  Oh, yeah.  10 grand's the big mark right there.  Like, if you go to the bank and take out more than 10 grand, they're going to wonder  why and where it came from and what are you money laundering and what the fuck is going  on in your life.  It's like, it's my fucking money.  That's because the terrorists are trying to blow up the country.  Oh, that must be it.  No, that's the reason.  Well, it was before that.  I heard it went into effect after that. 
[00:24:30]  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Because it's really nice when you go to the bank and maybe you have a lot of stuff to  pay for or something.  You want to take out some cash.  Whatever.  You mean you want to take out your money?  Yeah.  You want to take out your fucking money.  Without anyone noticing?  And then they've got to be like, oh, well, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  They'll give it to you.  We've got to report.  Oh, they'll give it to you.  Oh, they'll give it to you.  And then they report it to the government and say, hey, he took out this much.  And then the government goes, hey, by the way, we noticed you took out this much money. 
[00:25:00]  Say 20,000.  In 2009.  Why?  But none of your fucking business.  Oh, really?  No, it's all their fucking business.  It's all their business.  That's the problem.  Yeah.  You see the fucking country printed on that money?  That's the problem.  We own that fucking money.  That ain't your money.  Go fuck yourself.  Go fuck yourself.  That's what they say.  Yeah.  So let's say your sister needs help and you want to give her 20 G's.  After the 10.  The problem is always hooking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  That's what I've said to my family members.  Start sucking cock, you bitch.  But after about the 10, there's issues. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  Now that's problem.  See, someone's got to pay the tax on that 10.  How about they stop, if they didn't forgive the debt of other countries or whatever to  get what we want, I wouldn't mind it as much, but knowing that like Pakistan and all  these countries are getting millions of fucking dollars from us or whoever they, just so they  do what we want in the United Nations or with terrorism.  Oh, I know.  We could have no deficit.  We could be so prosperous.  If it wasn't for the way the fucking, that the government handles so much of this bullshit,  cut off these fucking, these scab countries, pick them and flick them. 
[00:26:00]  These fucking scab ass shit countries like Pakistan.  Fuck you, Pakistan.  Fuck them.  That's a great campaign platform.  Yeah.  Oh, I would run on that one in a second.  Fuck Pakistan.  Fuck every one of these shithole mud pies in Africa.  Fuck them all.  Why are we giving them money?  It's going directly to some warlord with a machete clicking his way through his country 
[00:26:30]  and trying to kill everybody.  Fuck them too.  We should put the money in the rocket ship or something and send it up to let it go around  in space.  It would be easier.  Space bank.  Ship.  Thank you.  Space bank.  I like it.  Tired of it.  God.  Let me, let me, uh, let me not doing my share.  Let me say half the Congo.  These people are lit out there, man.  They are lit.  Go ahead, Ron.  Start with you, buddy.  How about going, guys?  All right.  Hey. 
[00:27:00]  You know, you guys need to show up to keep it down a little bit about that ball, man.  Now the IRS will go after the kid for what the ball was worth when he gave it back to  Jeter.  You know, if he could have sold it for $100,000, they'll go after him for the $100,000.  Well, I want to know more about this because he said he gave the ball to Jeter as a gift  with no strings attached.  I don't know if the IRS just goes, oh, okay.  Yeah.  Why aren't they looking at Jeter to pay the taxes on the value of that fucking ball?  I really want to know now. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Well, you said you can't gift more than $10,000.  Well, if the ball's worth $100,000, then the kid's on the hook for that.  Who's to say what it's worth until it's up for sale or sold, though?  How do they do that?  Do they estimate value?  There has to be a way they do that.  I'm telling you something doesn't make sense here.  I don't think you can just – Jeter has a responsibility in this now, too.  This ball is worth money and was handed over to Jeter.  So now Jeter has a ball that's worth anywhere from what?  Up to $100,000, they're saying about maybe?  I've heard up to $400,000. 
[00:28:00]  Up to $400,000?  Yeah.  So the IRS isn't looking at Jeter like you now have something that's worth $400,000.  We want our taste.  Who knows about this?  Now the kid will have to claim whatever money that is on his taxes because –  Well, I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah, guys.  Sorry, Ron.  Go.  I'm sorry.  $12.99.  Baseball's worth.  See, Jeter won't – but Jeter will pay the tax quietly without caring.  But I wonder if that's a real thing.  It probably is.  But they say that they want $30,000 from him for that or whatever. 
[00:28:30]  His accountants – it won't matter to him.  That would be like if you got something that meant something and they're like,  hey, give us $1.25, you'd go, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I get –  It's so –  Jimmy, I get all that, but I'm wondering if that's even something he has to worry about.  I think it's considered something like stock still on paper.  I don't think until some kind of transaction is made that it has a value.  Okay.  That makes a real sense.  You're not going to be taxed on a stock you still own until you sell it.  And then, of course, they'll fucking overtax the shit out of it with capital gains. 
[00:29:00]  Thanks.  But the baseball itself, I'm not sure if they could value it like that.  Oh, wait.  You don't get – I'm sorry.  You don't get taxed – this is how dumb I am.  You don't get taxed on stock until you sell it?  Yeah.  Because I have stock, but I'm like, I want to make sure I'm paying – I actually would  call my account.  I'm like, I want to make sure I'm paying my – but I haven't sold it.  No, it just sits there.  Because it's paper.  It doesn't matter.  Oh, all right.  So you could sit on it.  I was panicking about that.  Make all kinds of money on it, but until you sell it –  I bought one share of Apple at $325.  I made $45, and I want to know how much do I owe? 
[00:29:30]  About 23.  I know.  Yeah.  Depending on how long you've had it.  Isn't it up to 50?  What is it?  It's crazy.  Capital gains.  Yeah.  On short, if you hold something short-term and get rid of it real quick –  Because you're trying to invest and make money on your money.  So you make a good deal.  That they already have taxed.  Yeah, yeah.  A little taxed because it's in the bank.  And they want half of it.  And they want even more after that.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, the only way to do it is to vote for candidates who want – like, that 17% across 
[00:30:00]  the board tax, which for 20% is fair.  I would love that.  I would love a flat tax.  Well, let's walk through this.  Everyone pays.  Let's walk through this again.  Let's say you have $25,000 that you made from your job.  Yeah.  That $25,000 was actually more money because they taxed the original money, right?  Now you put it in a bank for a little while, and they tax the $25,000 that's in the bank.  They tax the interest on it, yeah.  Then you say, you know what?  I'm not making enough interest with this investment, so now I'm going to take the $25,000 out of 
[00:30:30]  the bank, and I'm going to now invest it in the stock market.  And by the way, it's all my liability.  Right.  I'm taking the chance on not fucking – on getting nothing back from this investment.  So then you get some good investments.  Yeah, maybe you luck out.  And then now maybe you're $25,000, you turn it into $35,000.  Yep.  Well, now the government says, well, you made a profit of $10,000, you owe us $5,000.  Yeah, but I was taking all the risk.  Oh, yeah, but we don't care.  $25,000, and we sit here like assholes and go, oh, okay, keep fucking us in the ass. 
[00:31:00]  We understand.  How does that make sense?  Because we've sat here for many years as they slowly fucked us, and we said yes at every  turn.  It's because we got caught into a two deal.  We have two options.  Yep.  Like, if you want the more conservative option, you may pay less taxes, but then I think things  like Wall Street falling apart are going to happen more often, and they're not regulated.  So they fuck you that way.  And if you want stuff like more liberal policies, like I'm kind of leaning towards lately, I'd 
[00:31:30]  like to see Obama stay because of the liberal policies.  But then again, this tax stuff sucks, so I'm going to get fucked.  You can't get the third person in there who kind of takes a little bit from both.  He's trying to fuck you severe right now.  Thank God for the GOP being in there to block him, because all he wants to do now to try  before the election and get this deficit down and get his budget in order is tax the living  fuck out of anybody that's doing anything with their life right now. 
[00:32:00]  And fuck this making over $250,000 a year bullshit.  That was gone a long time ago.  He's trying to tax the shit out of every motherfucker that is earning anything right now.  And the GOP saying, no, we're not allowing you to raise taxes.  And speaking of eating peas, how about this?  And again, I don't know who paid for Michelle's trip to Europe or whatever.  Oh, we did. 
[00:32:30]  How about you eat your peas and tell her to stay local instead of going to Europe for  $400,000 or $500,000 what it costs for security?  How about that?  She loves that.  She loves our dresses.  She loves all this shit that's on the government till because it's considered, you know, she's  being kind of an envoy.  Wouldn't it be cool if all of a sudden Obama goes, okay, Michelle decided not to do her  European vacation.  It was going to cost, you know, the taxpayers $400,000.  Yeah, yeah.  Go to Detroit!  We have decided to take that $400,000 and pay for this. 
[00:33:00]  Right.  I'd be like, what the fuck is that?  Oh, wow.  That's kind of cool.  That's pretty good.  It's going to pay for like a fucking six feet of highway.  Well, whatever.  I know.  I know.  Exactly.  But whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I get what you mean.  Fuck yeah.  But you're right.  That would never happen, but that would be a nice thing to do.  And then the government, they like to, this is some very serious shit going down and they  joke about it by saying peas.  We've got to all eat our peas.  It's a goof. 
[00:33:30]  It's a joke.  And then I was watching a little bit of the press conference.  It was yesterday, I guess.  I'm losing track of time because of this kid thing.  And, uh, you know, Obama brings up peas and everyone's like, oh, I got to eat our peas.  Just chuckling.  I'm sitting here, sitting in my living room going, this is really fucking serious.  Yeah.  And they're chuckling because he mentioned peas.  He's, uh, and wow.  Did, uh, my chick even notice yesterday.  She's like, she's like, wow.  Is he looking like bad?  He's looking ashy. 
[00:34:00]  He's ashy to the point where he looks like a vampire that got caught out in the sun.  He's just really getting grayish looking.  Not just his hair either.  He is really, look at his head.  He needs that just for men.  Oh yeah, he really does.  But he does do the just for men.  Yeah.  Because then all of a sudden he'll be.  I think he skipped a session here.  Yeah.  Because then all of a sudden he'll be, he'll have really dark hair again.  Yeah.  But he keeps it so short it grows out fast.  Do you think they like a little gray in there because it makes them look more stately?  Distinguished?  Yeah.  This is the greatest I've seen him look.  Yeah. 
[00:34:30]  And then all of a sudden, you watch a week or so from now, he'll have jet black hair again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He'll be, uh, stylin'.  Who would want that gig?  Who would want that gig?  But you know what?  Ex-presidents seem to live a long time.  It helps they get out.  And they have, they have, I have a throat thing.  Oh good.  The head of fucking, uh, surgery will be over in five minutes to look at your throat.  Of course they live, they're the greatest doctors in the world, putting their fingers  up their assholes every three minutes.  Right.  Not only that, they're giving, they're giving you the stuff that, uh, they're not going 
[00:35:00]  to give the rest of us anytime soon.  The FDA hasn't approved this and won't for five years, but we know it works.  It cures everything.  Yeah, we know.  We know for a fact that this is the cure for everything.  When, when, when, when, uh, when.  I sound like Bill Burr now.  I kind of believe in some of that shit.  I, you know, I think they have something there that just, uh, you know, they inject in and  the president lives for fucking 90 years.  I, I just don't go as deep as Bill Burr, but I believe in some of that shit.  These fucking guys, you, they don't have to call an insurance person who tries to tell  them. 
[00:35:30]  Right.  You think Jimmy Carter has to go through insurance and they go, well, here's why you're  not covered for that test.  You're not 75.  Yeah.  Oh boy.  It's the test he wants or needs at any given moment.  Oh yeah.  They do not, they obviously expect much better health care.  Why, why doesn't my insurance cover this MRI?  Really?  Exactly.  No, he's in the machine in two seconds.  And he should be.  I mean, you know, I don't want the ex-presidents dying by the time they're 60, but enough already.  They do live a long time.  It does go.  And they start looking a lot younger after they leave office. 
[00:36:00]  Oh my God.  George W.  Bill Clinton made a huge comeback.  Like George W.  Now it's just like, hey, he's fucking, I think he actually can pitch for the Rangers  if he wanted to.  No, I know.  He's out there.  Yeah.  You know why I know it's all bullshit in the end?  Language.  And I wasn't a huge George W.  Fan.  Sure.  But that guy doesn't want anything to do with this shit.  Nope.  He has said no to everything.  He's like, fuck that.  I know what it's really about.  I'm going back to fucking Texas and I'm going to enjoy my life. 
[00:36:30]  He wrote a book.  He did a little book tour and then was like, that's it.  That ain't saying me no more.  That says a lot.  Yeah.  What the hell is going on in the government that he doesn't want to be part of it at all?  You know?  He doesn't want it.  Yeah.  And now Pakistan, by the way, is fucking arresting someone who is going to help us get, I've  had enough of that shitty country and their fucking shitty radical ideology.  Enough.  Disgusting country that is.  That we're just pumping blackmail money into.  It's all like if they have nukes and we're protecting the nukes. 
[00:37:00]  By the way, we should fucking nuke their nukes.  Fuck them.  Do you know who's good friends or knows?  I can't say good, but is friends with Bush Senior is a friend of ours.  What?  You know, right?  I think.  Bush Senior.  Troy Kwan.  Ah.  Didn't even know that.  No, Bush Senior is just a fan of Troy Kwan's music.  I don't know.  Vic Henley.  Bill Tetley?  No.  Why?  Bill Tetley.  Vic Henley knows Bush Senior.  Like, he'll return his calls. 
[00:37:30]  He's done our show two or three times.  Why haven't we talked about this?  I talked to him about it.  I told him last time I saw him.  Vic Henley is this southern comic that has just started to do our show in the last year.  Yeah, I love Vic.  Very funny guy.  Really?  How does he know Bush?  He has a story with it.  I'll let him tell it because I don't know the whole.  He did tell me once.  It was an event that they were doing together.  A function that Vic was performing at.  Some private company where Bush had involvement.  And he was there and they got to know each other.  Because we were talking about, you know how, and Vic doesn't brag. 
[00:38:00]  It came because we were talking about photographs and stuff like that and celebrity photos.  And I think I asked him about something.  And then he happened to mention Bush.  Like, oh yeah, that's the only one I ever got.  He obviously downplays it because he should have bragged about that on our show.  I think he does it in his act at one point a bit.  So if he calls Bush, Bush will call him back most likely?  Yeah, I don't think the same day.  You don't get a call back from these guys the same day.  But he said he's reached out to Bush before and he does call back.  Wow. 
[00:38:30]  And he knows him if he sees him and they talk.  That's way better than my Obama dream.  Oh yeah.  That's a real friendship.  That's a good one.  Oh wow.  Isn't Vic Henley a drunk?  Yeah, but Vic likes to tip a few back.  I sure do.  Vic's got that.  Vic is a very, Vic's a very, you can't see Vic when he talks, but he's always smiling.  He's a funny dude.  And you can't not feel good around him.  He's got that good energy.  I know that there's a rage in there somewhere. 
[00:39:00]  That means he's hiding something.  Oh, is there an ugliness in there?  The ones that are that happy?  Oh boy.  It runs deep.  What happened to you?  Oh yeah.  Hey, I want to go to Wayne in Texas.  Because this happened to me as well.  Wayne, go ahead, sir.  How you doing, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, Kay.  I owned a car, got married, bought a brand new car, paid the taxes on estate taxes, got married, decided I was going to give the car to my wife. 
[00:39:30]  They want me to pay, when you re-register it, you have to pay the taxes on it.  I said, well, there's no value to it.  I'm gifting it to her.  But the lady whips out a blue book and says, well, here it is.  Here's the value of it.  This is how much you pay.  Fuck you.  I know this happened to you because I had an old car.  It wasn't worth much, but I gave it to my brother-in-law.  This exact thing happened.  Remember the old days you had a car?  You don't need the car anymore. 
[00:40:00]  You're buying a new car.  Your life is, you're doing pretty well.  So you're like, you know what?  I know this guy's struggling.  I don't need 500 bucks to give him my old car.  You just gave the old car.  Not anymore, man.  Because when that guy now registers it, this is exactly what happened.  My brother-in-law went to register it down there in Philly, and they whipped out a blue book and said, well, the value of this car is now blah, blah.  You owe the taxes on that.  Yep.  But if you pay taxes when you bought it, the taxes on the car have already been paid.  Say it was a $30,000 car.  You pay that. 
[00:40:30]  Here's the taxes on the car.  Why the fuck do you have to repay taxes on the same item?  It's like when you chew gum.  If you give gum away, do you have to pay taxes on it?  Anytime you re-register the vehicle, you re-tax.  They re-tax the vehicle.  They want their taste.  They're looking for taste all over the place.  I'd love to listen to this.  Here's another thing.  Hold on.  I'm so distracted by your Australian, Texas accent.  What the fuck is that?  That's 25 years in America. 
[00:41:00]  So where were you from?  I'm in Australia.  Oh, it is.  Okay.  I heard that and I'm like, is that Australian, Texas?  I've never heard.  Dude, it sounds ridiculous.  So do you want to string up dingo lovers?  He's a kangaroo lover.  Wayne.  Stacey Anthony ate the baby.  Wayne.  Wayne, you've been in this country for 25 years.  Get rid of that Australia shit.  It's time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So how are you holding on to that? 
[00:41:30]  I was going with it.  I call you guys a couple times.  I'm in the music business.  I moved off of Long Island for five years and moved to Western New York.  I got rid of my Long Island accent.  Yeah.  David, it's time.  25 years and you can't get rid of that Australia shit?  It's coming back because now we're back in the area.  Yeah.  Do you know my accent?  I get an accent if I'm in a place for more than five minutes.  I'm really annoying to travel with.  You're that guy.  Yeah.  I immediately get it.  I'm pretty bad with that, too.  My family thinks I'm American until I get on the phone and talk to my brother. 
[00:42:00]  My accent gets thicker and thicker the longer the conversation.  What else did you want to tell us?  Because you said, I want to tell you something else and we kind of cut you off.  Yes, I'm sorry.  Yeah.  I'm in the music business.  I have a couple of entertainer coaches, big tour buses.  Oh, really?  Wow.  If you register.  Now, these are expensive fucking things, right?  How much does one of those cost?  Like a good tour bus for a band?  $600,000 to a million dollars.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  So, to register that in Texas, it's $100,000. 
[00:42:30]  Holy shit.  How did they figure that out just to register it?  What?  Because the registration is based on the value of the vehicle.  Value of the vehicle.  Oh, my gosh.  But if you register, if you set up a $300 LLC in the state of Montana, you can register  your motorhome for $120. 
[00:43:00]  Got to love Montana.  Yeah.  And that's why a lot of boats you'd see are registered out of Wilmington, Delaware.  In the old days.  I'm not even sure if that's still done.  It might be.  You'll see tractor trailers with Montana plates.  Yeah.  And, I mean, it's just freaking ridiculous.  My dad knew all that shit.  Yeah.  I bet you a lot of that shit has gone away, but.  Knew all that fucking get-around-this-bullshit shit.  Let's not forget, my dad started his own church for tax purposes. 
[00:43:30]  He never gave one sermon, but, man, it was legal.  I'll tell you something.  We were all part of a church.  A church.  I think he can be an ordained minister in Nevada for, like, $65.  I don't know.  I think it's changed.  I think the government finally figured out that some of these rules were ridiculous.  You can't be a tax-free religion.  I wanted to do it online just so I could get the parking pass.  You know, they have, you know, clergymen.  You know, you can stick in the window. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, yeah.  We've seen that, sir.  Just, yeah.  Yeah.  I cannot fucking wait at some point in my life to leave New York State.  This fuck, fuck shit state.  This tax the fuck out of you state.  And believe me, the federal government is worse.  But I just, I can't wait to get out of here and go to a state where maybe they don't have a state tax.  Maybe they're not raping me at every turn state-wise. 
[00:44:30]  Living in, uh.  I don't know.  Living in New York City is ridiculous.  Yeah, that's, that is insanity.  They just decided, oh, you have to pay city taxes, too.  Yeah, now you need city taxes.  I don't pay enough with federal and state?  Federal, state, and city.  Yeah.  Who decided that's logical?  Yeah, isn't that great?  Yeah, now you gotta pay a city tax.  Oh, really?  Isn't this city part of the fucking state, which is part of the country?  Can't you all just get together and tax me once?  Can you fuck me once and divvy it up between you as needed? 
[00:45:00]  Because you're politicians, and you're probably supposed to know which parts of the country need a little more and less and this and figure it out.  And, and, and just fuck me once?  But no.  They dick you in the ass so many different times by so many different dicks.  I hate it.  Unbelievable.  Makes me, makes me want to think of that song that I was working on called...  What was that?  Gonna love the big apple till the day I die.  I just got goosebumps. 
[00:45:30]  Do you have any more?  That's all I got.  That's all you got so far?  Gonna love the big apple till the day I die.  That's all I got so far.  It's a country twang to it.  Oh, I hate it.  You don't like that?  Oh.  Well, well, have an open mind.  He might come up with more lyrics.  Oh, I know, I know.  That's just it.  I know he will.  I know Jimmy likes Johnny Cash.  There's a Johnny Cash influence in this song.  Oh, it may not be perfect, but I'm gonna love the big apple till the day I die.  See?  It's getting better already, Ed. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, is it?  Yes.  I could hear it.  He might have a hit on his hands.  I'd have a hit on his head if he keeps saying that.  Call Willie's place.  I hate it.  I hate it.  Ed, you're right, I think.  A lot of people saying the baseball has zero value, value, excuse me, till it's sold.  Till it's sold or something.  And then we got good old Marcos in Yonkers.  Marcos.  Hey, good morning, my boys.  Oh.  Hi.  I was gonna say that this guy really, really gives meaning to the phrase young and stupid. 
[00:46:30]  The Dirk Jeter guy?  Yeah, the Dirk Jeter guy.  What was it that he said that he has his whole life ahead of him?  I have a friend of mine that's 31 years old and is in stage four cancer.  What the fuck is this guy talking about?  Oh, so you're saying he might not have his whole life in front of him.  Yeah, what kind of cancer does your friend have?  Oh, dude.  Oh.  Stage four. 
[00:47:00]  You'd think you'd want to be on the main stage for that whole...  Stage four is where the hipsters are.  Is that where the hipsters hang out?  Yeah, it's not a bad place.  Yeah.  All right.  So this guy's 23, says he has his whole life ahead of him.  $100,000 in student loans.  He owes $100,000.  He's 23 years old.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, we started making money in radio when we were in our 30s, thank God.  I was well in...  Let me think.  I was at least 32, 33 and still owed student loans. 
[00:47:30]  Wow.  10, 11 years.  Really?  Yeah.  And that's what's going to happen to this guy.  This guy's going to be easily in his 40s and still not...  And still will be in debt.  Yeah, I didn't pay off my credit cards until my mid to mid-late 30s.  Yeah.  I had, like, huge credit card debt.  That's one...  And the only reason is because we hit.  Oh, yeah.  It's the only reason.  Believe me, I'd be fucked.  Did I think the prostitutes jack my credit cards up one time and they put, like, $10,000  worth of phony charges on them? 
[00:48:00]  Oh, those prostitutes.  I used to see hookers on credit cards, like, really, like, shady ones.  Oh, my God.  And I owed, like, $3,000, but then I owed, like, $13,000.  How do you give a hooker a credit card?  That's 10 years ago.  Wow.  I didn't say I was a bright kid.  No.  I was, like, 25 or, you know, 26.  Yeah.  I called my credit card company.  I'm, like, that's not charges are not mine.  And they're, like, what are they from?  And I told them.  Prostitutes.  I did say that.  I'm, like, it was a hooker.  I gave her a credit card and I scored.  Yeah.  And they took them off. 
[00:48:30]  They honored it.  They did?  Wow.  Yeah, because they knew that the charges were inconsistent with what I had been spending  or whatever.  Oh.  Or not in the place.  Yeah, they could look at patterns, spending patterns.  Years ago, that was.  Wow.  I'm surprised they took that off.  Wow.  What an honest guy.  Well, I forget what the.  They were for goods and services, sir.  That's all I want to say.  I forget what they charged that was obviously not mine.  It was some stupidity.  Pete on Long Island.  Yeah, this one.  Aids cocktails.  Yeah.  Oh, whoops.  Pete on Long Island. 
[00:49:00]  Go ahead, sir.  Pete.  Good morning, boys.  Hello.  How you doing?  You know, with all the tax talk, what about the luxury tax?  You can't even order anything nice without getting fucked in the air.  Oh, I hate that thing.  You land on it.  It's right between Boardwalk and Park Place.  And you think you're going to make it through and get to go.  Yeah.  Who decided that we need to pay luxury taxes?  Yeah.  Luxury.  And there's like a hardworking stiff out there.  And then he kind of makes good and decides, you know what?  I'm going to finally buy my wife or my family something nice. 
[00:49:30]  I guess a boat would be luxury taxed, right?  Yeah, sure.  Maybe a little boat so we can go fishing.  Would be nice, right?  And all of a sudden the government goes, well.  Give me.  Give me a little of that, too.  Oh, wait a minute.  But didn't you take the money that I'm spending to buy this boat?  Didn't you tax the fuck out of that already?  Oh, yeah, yeah, we did.  See, but you're using it now.  Oh.  But then didn't you tax me when I bought the boat just regular taxes?  Yeah, yeah.  See, but this is extra tax. 
[00:50:00]  On top of that.  You know why?  Because not everyone can afford that.  So we really got to fuck you over because you've done good in this country.  Oh, thanks.  We have to share the wealth and spread it around like a socialist fucking government.  Eat me.  I want to keep what's mine, fucko.  It's just unbelievable.  Pakistan.  Yuck.  Oh, wow.  This is good to know.  Matt in New York.  Matt.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  That clergy thing is alive and well if you go into some of the darker neighborhoods. 
[00:50:30]  Like, I work in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and there's a church on, like, there's about three churches on every block.  Oh, yeah.  They're all under investigation, by the way.  That's like the Reverend Al.  But my dad never had an actual church.  Oh.  Filled out some forms.  All of a sudden, he's some kind of church guy, and we didn't have to pay taxes on nothing.  That sounds nice.  Well, I don't see a single one of them ever open.  The right Reverend Hughes?  Yeah.  Was that it?  I've told this story many times.  We had to walk around with the tax exempt form and hand it to the lady behind the counter. 
[00:51:00]  I was mortified.  And then if I went home and then didn't use it, I would get in a lot of fucking trouble.  Did you get yelled at?  You've got to use your tax form.  I'm 14 years old, and I'm trying to buy a pair of sneakers.  Did you hand in the tax exempt form?  And they probably didn't know what the fuck you were giving them.  No, they didn't.  It's like, what?  What?  They're like, I'm not supposed to pay taxes.  I don't pay taxes.  I'm a child of the Lord. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, wow.  That's got to just weigh on you as a child.  That's too much responsibility to give a kid.  I'm a child of the Lord.  Child of the Lord.  I need these sneakers tax free.  Oh, yeah.  I would get in trouble, man.  It was a pain in the ass.  So then we just would go home and say, yeah, we handed over the tax exempt form.  Yeah.  You know, we figured out a way around it because it was just so embarrassing when you're hanging  out with your friends.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're all paying, you know, full price and taxes on some little who gives a fuck item,  and I'm handing this tax exempt form. 
[00:52:00]  You're handing in paperwork.  I'm a little lady at the cashier would have to put her glasses on and study the thing.  Like, what is this?  This kid isn't legal.  You're trying to rip me off.  Police.  And then I would go, I'm a child of the Lord.  Child of the Lord.  Look at me.  Wow, that is embarrassing.  I'm the chosen one.  I forgot what the church name was.  I think it had a name in everything.  That would force me to just steal shit.  Like, I'd be so paranoid, and I wouldn't want to give the guy the form.  I would just be like, I'm just going to steal these sneakers, fuck it.  Oh, I stole shit just because we were poor. 
[00:52:30]  Pool.  Yeah, so I stole shit.  Yeah, we all stole shit.  It was great.  I used to go into Models and steal sneakers all the time.  I would put on new sneakers, take the old ones, and just put them in the room.  Where the other ones, because it wasn't like in shoeboxes and shit.  They were in these racks.  It was shitty sneakers and stuff.  But you put them on, and there was some old fossil security guard at the door.  And it's like, I'm like 18 years old.  It's like, you're going to catch me in new sneakers, you motherfucker. 
[00:53:00]  I am so gone.  How easy do they make it?  Oh, it's fucking great.  Fat old security guard.  Let's walk past them.  And you're a young kid with brand new Nike sneakers.  Yeah, brand new sneakers.  I'm fucking, I'm peeling out.  That's hilarious.  Catch me if you can.  Yeah.  Do you, um...  Hey, Matt, anything else, brother?  You good?  Oh, also, I'm a cop, and I live on Long Island, but I have to pay New York City tax, because 
[00:53:30]  I work for the city.  Oh, your city, yeah.  City cops got to pay, unless they live in the city.  Isn't that great?  They even figure that out.  Oh, yeah.  Because some people go, well, yeah, I do have a job in the city, but I'm going to fucking  live somewhere else.  Doesn't matter.  Oh, nope, nope, nope.  What about, they don't give you a break on commuting into the city now, do they?  No.  Which will cost you an arm and a leg.  They finally got rid of that commuter tax.  What was the commuter tax?  That was that, like, I lived, or live, in a place that is serviced by the Long Island 
[00:54:00]  Railroad to go into the city.  And then a couple of years ago, they decided, hey, you don't take the railroad, you know,  you pay your property taxes, you do everything, but since the railroad's there, you're going  to be paying this fucking MTA tax.  So here, based on your salary and the percentage thereof, you are now taxed to pay on our fucking,  to pay our commuter system.  Like, but wait a minute, I pay fucking taxes for the road, I pay taxes for my car, I fucking 
[00:54:30]  easy pass the shit out of every fucking tunnel and bridge you make me drive over, I pay for  parking, I pay for everything, and now I got to pay for a train I don't use?  Yeah.  Yes, you do.  And that's because they can't figure out their bills.  No, because they got, again, five people doing the job of one, cocksuckers.  When is it going to be enough?  It's not.  And then what happens?  Until there is a horrid, bloody revolution in this country, until some leader rises up, 
[00:55:00]  can really rile the people to take to arms and just start killing other people.  That's the only way shit changes that quickly in a country, is a bloody, horrid revolution.  When will the government realize they're the problem?  Never.  Because it works for them.  Of course.  They don't know what common people do.  They don't understand being a congressman, a senator. 
[00:55:30]  They don't understand what it's like to work, to earn money, to make something of yourself,  and then have these dickless fuck shits take it away from you.  They don't know what that's like, because they don't have it done to them.  Right.  I'm tired of it.  I'm in agreement with you, man.  It's happening across the board to every single person, not just the rich.  No, the only people that are making out are the people that aren't working, aren't looking for work, 
[00:56:00]  are getting the hand out, they're on the dole.  You know who the fuck I'm talking about?  They're doing great right now.  I mean, the rich, yeah, you have to take more of the cock.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  But the rest of you, you're still taking some of the cock.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And unless you like the cock, guess what?  It sucks.  Yeah.  It's not good.  Right.  I can honestly say I do not like the cock.  Right.  It doesn't matter if it's just a piece of the head or the whole fucking thing. 
[00:56:30]  Guess what?  If you don't like cock, it sucks.  I don't even want the tip.  Right.  Nothing.  So that's why you out there should be concerned as well.  How about just the clear stuff from the tip?  From the tip.  Yeah.  If it's just wiped on there.  Like a fucking pen.  Leaky pen.  It exploded in my pocket.  It's all started with that clown that caught Jeter's ball.  You think Clemens is going to jail?  No.  That's a tough one.  No.  The perjury thing.  They never really throw guys in jail for it. 
[00:57:00]  Like high profile guys.  They really don't.  They figure out other shit, though.  Martha Stewart.  She went to jail for perjury.  All right.  Yeah.  But she was obnoxious about it.  I think it was her obnoxiousness that she forced their hand.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're right.  I forgot about Martha Stewart.  Yeah.  If she would have just told him, yeah, I fucking got a phone call.  I bought some stock.  She was a cunt about it, though.  But she lied to a grand jury.  So that was a biggie.  Okay.  Here we go.  More about this kid.  So he received some autographed balls, bats, and jerseys. 
[00:57:30]  If he sells any of that shit, he's going to have to pay taxes on it, obviously.  IRS declined to comment, but accountants say the agency will view Lopez's reward from the  team as income.  Yeah.  Let's view that as income.  What this guy did is incredible, said Jack Gold, a CPA.  I don't know of too many people who would have done that, but the IRS follows the rules,  and the rules are the rules.  That's the law.  Fucking cocksuckers.  The only thing I could equate it to is going on the Price is Right. 
[00:58:00]  We said this earlier.  And winning in an all-expense-paid trip to Tahiti.  Old days, you want a fucking trip to Tahiti.  You know that most of the people that win on game shows never go on those trips?  No.  Why?  Because they can't afford it.  They can't afford the tax.  They can't afford it.  They go to Tahiti, and then the IRS goes, well, a Tahiti trip would cost about $10,000  for a family, let's say.  So you owe, what would that be?  $3,000?  $3,500?  Yeah.  $3,500 to $3,500, right?  Yeah, probably.  I don't know what bracket you're in. 
[00:58:30]  One Midtown tax pro said the Yankees should offer Lopez the assistance he needs.  Maybe they will.  It would appear that he's going to be hit with some tax consequences.  Wait, wait.  Stop the presses.  I didn't know this.  Our own Sam Roberts has been a victim of this.  That's right.  Were your parents, what was this?  When I was at Nickelodeon.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Last line in, because then we can get through this.  Because this came up.  What the Yankees should do is pay the taxes on this for him if they really want to make  a public relations triumph. 
[00:59:00]  So I guess if the Yankees pay the taxes, that's good enough.  Then they'll owe taxes on the taxes.  All right.  But yeah, now I'm moving on to Sam Roberts, who was on Nickelodeon and won some shit.  Wow.  We had to pay taxes on everything.  What'd you win?  What'd you win?  It was not good prizes.  They gave...  I want a trip to Vermont.  Jesus.  I love it.  Well, you could be molested with a pine cone.  I want a shitty prize.  I know.  It could have sent me back.  It was filmed in Florida.  I was like, just send us back to Florida.  Yeah, yeah.  What would have been better? 
[00:59:30]  Vermont.  Wait.  What kind of trip to Vermont, though?  I like a ski lodge.  All right.  And skiing?  Yeah, or skiing.  Or I went in the summer, because I'm not going to ski.  And what?  You just sat in a stupid lodge for a couple days?  No, they had other summer activities, like mountain boarding, which is like skateboarding,  except with tires on the board.  I've seen those.  Yeah.  That was kind of fun.  And then I won a basketball hoop and a digital drum set.  Wow.  What did all the taxes come to? 
[01:00:00]  I don't remember, but I know my parents had to pay taxes on everything.  Oh, and I bet they were happy to do it for you.  Just like, yeah.  For you, yeah.  Why would you go on a game show?  Well, I didn't know I would have to pay taxes.  No, I'm just saying, for anyone, why would you go on a game show?  Yeah, why?  That sounds like it's just very complicated.  And expensive.  And expensive.  Unless the cash thing, where you could just be like, all right, give me half the cash.  Like Jeopardy.  This is Jeopardy.  Can you tell the price is right?  I don't want the trip to Tahiti. 
[01:00:30]  How would that work out?  No.  Wait a minute.  I think what I've read in disclaimers is you can take a cash exchange for it,  but it's a lot less than the actual price.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  Like a lot less.  Why do they have to penalize it because you decide, you know,  I don't want to deal with all the taxes.  And it's valued at $25,000.  And everybody's like, wah, wah, freaking out.  And they're like, oh, oh, look, you got to pay taxes on that trip.  Or we'll give you $500. 
[01:01:00]  And they're like, all right, well, you got to pay taxes on that, too.  So, like, you'll have, like, you know, $350.  The lottery does that shit, like you said earlier.  What happened to my fucking $25,000 trip?  I won the fucking big showcase.  We should have talked to that guy today, though.  We should try to get him on the phone.  A ball guy?  Yeah.  Let's try.  Have we tried?  We should have tried to get this guy on.  And that's something we should try.  Should have tried.  Yeah.  Hey, maybe he's a fan.  Hey, yeah.  Forget about it. 
[01:01:30]  How you doing?  How you doing?  I like that song.  Tax me.  How you doing?  Yay, keys!  Hey.  We're talking $14,000 in taxes.  Hey.  Hey, Kaminoosh.  Fill out my W-2.  Kaminoosh.  This is a perfect way to end the tax thing right here.  Yeah.  Because we brought this up.  Tony in Brooklyn.  Go ahead, Tony.  What the fuck is OTB off-track betting out of business? 
[01:02:00]  That says it all right there.  It's such a...  That shows you what the government does.  The government took a business that anybody can do, a bookie, taking bets, and they lost  money.  They lost money.  Because of mismanagement.  They really are dummies, aren't they?  And too many fucking chiefs.  That's a great example of what the government does.  How do you lose taking people's money for betting horses?  You never go to the track and see everyone at once go, we won! 
[01:02:30]  You see a couple of people go, woo!  And most people are ripping up paper going, die, son of a fuck, man.  How do you lose?  It's almost impossible to lose money as a bookie.  It really is.  Almost impossible.  They figured out how to fuck that up.  How long did they have it?  Oh, forever.  For years.  But then lost money for years.  It was mismanagement.  They were losing money year after year after year.  And then it finally got to a point where they were like, we've got to close this shit  down.  And they couldn't fire the people. 
[01:03:00]  Why?  Because it was state-run.  They can't fire the fucking people.  Oh, we belong to this union.  Or we do this.  Or I have tenure.  So it's like, oh, I can't fire five of you guys?  Nope.  All right.  Shut them down.  Fuck you.  We can't make money betting on horses.  Assholes.  Oh, shit, guys.  My ship is coming.  What happened?  I just got a text.  Oh, good one.  Need cash now?  Receive $100 to $1,500 direct to your bank in one hour. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Is this the one that Montel talks about?  No credit check.  Get instant approval.  Just type reply.  Oh, shit.  I love that one where Montel is on and he goes, do you need $1,000 in your account by  tomorrow?  Yes, we do.  And it's like, you know, pay off of that bill you have.  Maybe a sudden emergency has come up.  And all I'm thinking is, how the fuck are they going to pay that off?  If you need a grand in your account by tomorrow, they want their money back the next day. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  Two grand back.  Yeah, and they want two grand.  Time's a tough for Montel, I guess, huh?  Montel's out there busting legs, I think, if you're not fucking paying back his money  mutual.  Did you just say busted legs?  Busting his legs.  Oh, boy.  You're busting people's legs?  Well, maybe in the old days.  He kind of lives in my building.  I wouldn't make leg jokes.  Oh, shit.  A little wobbly these days.  Yeah?  The Montel.  Go to Money Mutual. 
[01:04:30]  Why the fuck is he doing these commercials?  Get up to a thousand bucks by tomorrow.  The medical emergency, handled.  Extra cash until payday, done.  Just be 18-  Done.  It's good acting.  Have a regular income of at least $800 a month.  Just remember, Money Mutual for short-term cash when you need it fast.  You need $800 a month.  And you'll know what's Money Mutual.  You need to make $800 a month?  That needs to be your pay.  It's $10.  And then you can get $1,000 in your account by tomorrow.  Yeah.  And then what are the-  I wonder what the-  What's the interest? 
[01:05:00]  I would love to know what the fucking interest is on that one.  Can we find the fine print on this?  I saw one with some Indian guy.  Yeah.  Not like-  But like American Indian guy.  And he said it was meant to lend money, just like Montel's doing, but to Indians.  And he goes, I know it's expensive to get this money, but sometimes you just need it.  And all I'm thinking is, oh, boy.  Oh, shit.  That's got to be expensive.  God damn.  Yeah, yeah.  I'd love to know what the kicker is on that one. 
[01:05:30]  It really is 60% to 70% interest?  Come on.  That's usury.  You can't-  How do they get away with that?  It's probably like overseas.  Overseas?  It's probably a ship in the ocean.  You think it's overseas?  Just over the-  Wow.  The border.  What do they do if you don't pay it?  What the fuck are they going to do?  Extradite you?  Yeah, that is true.  What could they do?  Wow.  Let's say hi to Don in Texas. 
[01:06:00]  Don?  Is that Don on the phone?  Hi.  Back in the 80s, my parents went down there to Price is Right.  They won a washer-dryer combo deal.  We already had a washer-dryer, so they ended up taking the cash.  By the time they paid all the taxes, all they got was about $80 or $90.  You're on a hit show, because especially in the 80s, Price is Right was a big fucking show.  Oh, yeah.  Come on down!  You walk away with $80. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  Also, about the loans that you guys were talking about on TV and everything, how they sit there  and get their money back is what you do is you authorize them to take a draft out of  your account, and it doesn't matter unless you go and just change banks or something  like that.  They're getting their money back.  Oh, so here's what happens.  You got like $10 in your bank, right?  Right.  And you have a job, because you have to have a job, that you make money on.  So they give you $1,000, put it in the account, and then if you don't pay, you can never put 
[01:07:00]  money in that account again, because they'll just take it.  How does that happen?  How do they have authorization to do that?  You probably give them power of attorney to take that money out of your account.  But if you do that, can't you just open another account somewhere?  Yeah, you can open up another account, and then you just start fresh, and it's, fuck  you, you don't have your money anymore.  But if you keep that account, what happens is the minute that your paycheck hits the bank, 
[01:07:30]  it's gone.  If you're over 30 days late on making the payment to them, that's the way they do it.  They take it all out at one time.  So how do the banks allow that?  The banks don't give a shit.  You're either going to pay it, or it's going to go on your credit.  I have a credit card like that.  Well, it's not a credit card.  It's a debit card like that.  And it got ran up to about $3,500.  And I just said, fuck you.  Got to close the account, open up a new account, and it's on my credit now, seven years later 
[01:08:00]  still.  I don't want to lose this.  Stay on the line for a second there.  Carolina man, he's a regular.  Carolina man.  Hope I did the need cash now thing.  It's 336%.  And he writes, for real, I got $600, and seven days later, I paid them $690.  In seven days, exclamation point, exclamation point, exclamation point, exclamation point.  400%.  So how is that allowable?  I guess if they tell you what it is, they should be able to charge the interest they want. 
[01:08:30]  And then another guy says it's 197% interest if you read TGE fine print.  Another guy said over 200%.  That's crazy.  If you've got a PR at the bottom, when it's that little blurry print, just stop it real  quick and read all that.  It's ridiculous.  I think it's official.  Montel Williams is in the mob.  Yeah, Montel Williams is now a loan shark.  I think he's part of the mob.  He's a loan shark, yeah.  Montel is a loan shark.  Makes it all nice and happy on TV, but fuck, they're going to break your legs. 
[01:09:00]  Done.  Need extra cash until payday?  Done.  Don't worry about it.  Wow.  Wow.  This guy looked up the Indian loan company that you brought up at.  Oh, he did.  Rick in Tampa did some, you did some research on this, Rick?  Yeah, boy, they did.  Because like Anthony said, the Indian says, yes, the money's expensive.  So I decided to look into it.  First of all, if you want $1,000, you've got to take out a $1,500 loan because they have 
[01:09:30]  a $500 loan fee.  Secondly, wait, slow down.  We're enjoying that point.  That is fantastic.  Wait, say that again.  I'm sorry.  That's the loan fee.  Now, imagine going to an ATM.  You take out $1,000 and it says, there's a $500 charge on that.  You know what's funny about that?  I took out, what did I take out?  $200,000.  Oh, it doesn't matter.  But the ATM fee at this bank I used yesterday because I just needed cash. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  $3.  I was out of my mind.  It's annoying, right?  $3.  I'm like, the fuck did you do that?  You need $3 from me.  I don't like when banks do it.  Why do banks do it?  I can see why some independent ATM machine does it.  What else is their advantage to have the machine as they make the money on the transaction fee?  This was a regular bank, but it wasn't my bank.  I'm fucking, yeah.  Well, check this out.  She's a ball's mom.  The interest rate.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Catherine.  Catherine, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:10:30]  Hello.  How are you?  Okay, good.  Are you getting a lot of phone calls from the media?  Yes, a lot.  I got to tell you, Catherine, you raised one hell of a son there.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Yeah, he's a good kid.  He gave the ball back, and that's really good.  Any regrets whatsoever?  Is he kind of going around and going, oh, boy, I should have maybe gotten a couple of  bucks off of this?  Not a minute, not a second.  But isn't this going to cost him now? 
[01:11:00]  Is he afraid about these taxes and these stories that are popping up?  You know, we just found out about it yesterday, my husband and I, and I don't even think he  knows, and so, you know, that's something that a 23-year-old, I guess, you know, is not aware.  He thought they were gifts.  I don't think he understands the implication.  As parents, we do.  Yes, we are concerned about it.  We're inquiring about it, and because, you know, he doesn't make a lot of money. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, and he owes some cash there.  So it's become a challenge, and we'll figure it out, though.  We'll figure it out.  But he could have got close to $100,000 for that ball, which would have paid off his student  loans.  Yeah.  We're very cognizant of that.  But when he was asked by his father, you know, is this what you really want to do, Christian 
[01:12:00]  is a very decisive kid, and he said, I understand the implication.  He's not a smart kid.  I understand that I, you know, I have to work it off.  Yeah.  I really, he had a very strong, you know, conviction that, you know, this was Derek Jeter's ball,  and it doesn't belong to him, and that he needed to give the ball back, and that was the size  of it, and as parents, we were very supportive, because we support integrity and values, and  we said, if that's what you want to do, then you go and do it, son. 
[01:12:30]  All right, Catherine, so you said, you know, your husband sat down with him, is this what  you really want to do, and then when your son said yes, did he go in another room and  start crying?  Yeah.  I got to tell you, Christian is, since he was a child, is an unusual child in that regard,  is that he values things that most people would not, and sacrifices things that most  people don't understand, and as parents, we have always watched him do these things, 
[01:13:00]  and we were always fascinated, and thought that, you know, my husband describes it, he  would always say to me, you know, Catherine, this kid's got God in his heart.  Holy cow.  And I was like, yeah, you know, and that's him.  I mean, we've tried to raise him right, and teach him values, but he's just instinctively,  inherently the way that he is.  He's a nice guy.  So how old do you think he'll be when he finally realizes life just kicks you around, and God, 
[01:13:30]  I should have taken the money.  I don't think Christian, knowing him for 23 years, is the type of young man that makes,  you know, he doesn't regret things.  He looks at things and says, you know, it is what it is, I had the experience, it was  phenomenal, I don't regret it.  And more than anything, what I notice about him now is that he's extremely grateful for  the experiences that he, you know, that he's having right now. 
[01:14:00]  He's having the time of his life, and for him, you know, he sees this as just a, he's  a fun guy.  He loves to have fun, and he's having fun, and he's happy.  And to him, and to us, that has enormous value.  Yeah, that's, that's, you know, like, you know, we're not a rich family by any means of  the imagination.  I know, we are.  As we see, you know, but as we see him so happy and, you know, thriving and handling 
[01:14:30]  himself well, I mean, we're seeing a lot of things about him we didn't know.  Hey, do you think the Yankees will pay the taxes?  Yeah, will the Yankees pay the taxes, Catherine?  I, you know what, I have no clue.  Well, the answer is no.  Probably not.  Probably not.  Just to cut to the chase, the answer is no.  Probably not.  Hey, has Derek Jeter, has Derek Jeter reached out and maybe handed over some pocket money  or something?  No, not at this time.  No.  And was Derek, a lot of people were saying that picture, Derek didn't look like he was 
[01:15:00]  all that thrilled.  There's another one.  What was the take on that?  Oh, I have no idea.  I never try to guess what's in people's mind, you know.  I think, you know, he was having his own moment of glory.  I guess so, yeah, and your son was just interfering with that.  Right.  Hey, listen, you know.  I'm just screwing around with you a little bit.  One time I caught a baseball and they're like, give it back.  I'm like, I ain't giving this back without a few hundred dollars. 
[01:15:30]  Ah, Chip.  That's Chip, though.  Chip, you're a lot different.  That's for sure.  You think Jeter's a nice guy, Catherine?  Oh, without a doubt.  Mr. Jeter is a class act.  And I think that the person who returned the ball to him is also a class act.  And I think they, you know, it's a reciprocal relationship.  Yeah, it's a big relationship there.  That's for sure.  She's very proud of her son here.  You know what?  It's all good.  Lost his number already.  You know what? 
[01:16:00]  It's all good.  You a good cook there, Catherine?  I'm an excellent cook.  Yeah.  What's your specialty?  Yeah.  I was just wondering.  It just looks, you know, I bet a lot of people gobble that food up.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah, I hear you.  What's your specialty?  Yeah.  What's your specialty?  Are you Italian?  What's the last name here?  No, no.  I'm not Italian.  I'm Spanish, but I don't really specialize.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Lopez.  Lopez. 
[01:16:30]  We're Lopez.  Yeah, Lopez.  Oh, it is Lopez.  Sure.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, yeah, I cook pretty good.  I was a terrible cook for 25 years, and it finally took off.  It finally took off.  Finally clicked.  That's good.  It finally clicked.  You know, it took 25 years.  All right.  Hopefully, they'll pay the taxes for him.  You know, that's great.  You know your son's going to be stuck in your house for the next 10 years, right?  With the student loan.  No.  And all he had to do was sell his ball, and he would be on his own.  Oh, have an apartment of his own.  Yeah.  Living Lodge. 
[01:17:00]  No, I think that, you know, what people have not considered is that, as a mother, had that  ball been in his home, or people even perceiving that that ball was in his home, that it creates  a danger for my son, and I'm very concerned about that.  That's why he's selling right away.  And you know what?  They could stop him, and they can jack his car, take us to the ball.  I mean, are you just going to live?  Yeah.  You know, no, I live in a very beautiful area. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, good.  You know what I'm saying?  You've got a lot of people that, you know, the ball is precious.  I don't like the way you think.  It's, you know, well, I'm a mother.  Yeah, yeah.  Differently than most other people.  So, as far as I'm concerned, you know, when I think about this from a different perspective,  I'm almost glad he doesn't have the ball, because if it puts my son in jeopardy, I don't  care if you give me $20 million.  I don't want it.  Not worth it, right?  Not worth it.  So, as far as we're concerned, we're okay. 
[01:18:00]  We're absolutely, you know, support our son.  And I think, in the end, it was the right decision, just on the safety end of it, I  think it was the safety decision.  Yeah, sure.  Hey, I hear youth in your voice.  Young mom?  Oh, no, sir.  I'm pretty long in the tooth.  Oh, boy.  I'm 57 years young.  I'll be 58 in March.  That's our uncle.  I'm not telling you my age. 
[01:18:30]  A woman never does that.  No.  Oh, so you're going to be going to a lot of Yankee games, I guess.  Yes, I'll be, I want my son to really enjoy the tickets with his friends.  I don't want to steal his thunder.  Do you think Jeter would have been annoyed if your son signed the ball and handed it back  to him?  That would have been great.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Awesome.  I don't know.  You know how great that would have been if he signed it?  Dearest Derek, best wishes, congrats.  Like, signed the whole ball so he couldn't display it.  Do it with a pocket knife. 
[01:19:00]  You totally ruined it.  Horrible.  Oh, good gravy.  I know.  I know.  But it's, like I said, we're...  Look, I guess there's people still in this world like you and your son.  Yeah, you raised a good boy.  That's what I learned today.  Just about every other person would have sold that damn thing.  I think he was right to give it back.  It's hard to do.  But if he sells it, he's part of what's disgusting about this country.  And, you know, I think he did the right thing.  Maybe we could all learn from your son, Catherine.  Yes.  Maybe we all can learn a little lesson today.  That's right.  When a ball comes, knock everyone out of the way and fall on it. 
[01:19:30]  Right.  Sell it on eBay and don't be stupid.  You know what?  It is what it is.  We stand by our values.  We think he did the right thing.  We absolutely understand that the American way is take the money and run.  The Lopez family is not really about that.  I think she's right.  And we never have been.  We never have been.  We're happy.  We're a happy family.  So it doesn't really...  You know, we place more value in our family values. 
[01:20:00]  And I'm not giving you, you know, smoke or anything like that.  That's the way we really are.  Do we ask for drugs?  Come on, now.  What are you talking about?  Not only was...  Sell us drugs?  Not only was my family not like that, but when your son gave the ball back, my mother  called and screamed at me, just in case I ever caught one.  She yelled at me to sell it.  That's funny, dude.  Well, Jimmy is a funny man.  Well, thank you, I guess. 
[01:20:30]  Look, much like your son, I got to eat.  So let's go.  And thank you for spending a couple of moments with us.  A couple.  You're welcome.  Thank you very much.  We talked for 30 seconds.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you, Catherine.  And say hi to your son.  Yes.  I most certainly will.  Is he around?  Maybe we could talk to him, too, later or something.  Oh, he's been...  He is exhausted.  I bet.  Give him a break.  Walking up the stairs.  Yes.  But, you know, he... 
[01:21:00]  Hey, listen.  Just digesting breakfast.  I'm sure he's exhausted.  Yeah.  Just kidding.  Oh, it's...  We're incorrigible sometimes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But we have our own E-Rock here who, you know...  Exactly.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Catherine, very much.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye, dear.  Oh, she raised a super kid, huh?  Yeah, she goes.  That's very sweet.  I was supposed to be a super kid, but then...  That's nice.  But then the fucking world...  I'll take the kid.  Look at the...  Then the world got to me.  What a nice mommy.  Yeah, she's nice.  That's a nice mommy. 
[01:21:30]  What are you going to do?  He's a nice guy.  He did do...  Delusional is all hell.  Oh, yeah.  He did do the right...  He did so delusional.  He did the right thing.  In her mind.  Right.  I'm in.  All right.  We should take a break.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  I interrupted you.  No, I think you did the right thing.  I don't think...  Even though it's hard.  It's easy to...  Not only does he have to pay taxes.  I don't think so.  Meaning, the guy hit the ball.  It's a career milestone.  He's the first Yankee to ever do it.  Here, take...  It is the right thing to do to hand it back and not be a greedy twat like this country we are. 
[01:22:00]  But again, the fact that he's being paying...  Being taxed on it is everything that he didn't contribute to by giving it back.  Right.  He wasn't the greedy scumbag that most citizens are and that our government is.  He's a monkey wrench in the machine.  He's a fan.  He's the way he is.  He's going to go to some games.  The Yankees are taking care of him.  They fucking gave him box seats.  And it's like, what else does he want?  It's a ball he handed back.  If it was hit number 207, nobody would give a turkey.  Excuse my language.  I think I was wrong about Jeter, too, by the way.  I'll talk about that later.  Oh, okay.  I think I made a mistake. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, well.  You finally made...  You made a mistake?  I don't mind having any mistakes.  But I mean...  Oh, no.  In that situation.  After the break, we've got to find out about this.  Yeah, I think I was wrong.  What?  No.  I thought about it last night.  I just had a bad picture of myself.  Wow.  Ho, ho, ho.  Breaking news.  Well, I'm a child of the Lord, and I need to eat.  Yes, you are.  He was always a good boy.  Taking your...  Hey, Joey Baseballs, how you doing, man? 
[01:23:00]  Hey, not for nothing.  I'm great at the Yankees doing.  Oh, forget about it.  How you doing?  What a year it's been.  My boy, Chalute's called.  He wants us to do a little something special for the fellas.  Yeah, wait a minute.  This little thing we're going to sing right now?  Wait a minute.  This is the Yankees. 
[01:23:30]  New York City, the greatest city in the world.  How you doing?  Yankees.  How you doing?  How about the legends?  How you doing?  The Bay.  How you doing?  The Iron Horse.  How you doing?  Yankee.  How you doing?  The Yankee Clipper.  How you doing?  And, of course, Mickey Mouse. 
[01:24:00]  How you doing?  How you doing?  Oh, yeah.  Well, we got Captain America coming in today.  That's a biggie.  He's not doing a lot of interviews.  Chris Evans.  Yeah.  We're looking forward to that.  When's the movie coming out?  In theaters July 22nd.  Wow.  Right around the corner.  July 22nd.  July 22nd.  I think I'm going to go check out the last Harry Potter movie today. 
[01:24:30]  Are you?  Got a special invite.  Oh, from?  With the IMAX.  From Hans Gruber?  From Hans Gruber.  I'd rather check out something with Colonel Potter.  Get a smash.  I couldn't think of another.  I'd rather go to Potter's Field.  It's all the Potter's jokes I have.  The Harry Potter kids were all over Lincoln Center yesterday.  Yeah.  Oh, is that what that was?  Oh, my God.  Oh, okay.  Just yelling and screaming and losing their minds.  Nobody.  You didn't see anybody?  You didn't see Hermione? 
[01:25:00]  Well, I checked it out later in the day.  You couldn't get close to it.  There were thousands of kids there.  Thousands.  And they were camping out for days.  Wow.  And they were walking around, like, with the ties and the glasses.  Oh, enough of that.  And signs.  Dressing up like him.  He's a man already.  And rugby shirts that had whatever the fucking school that they fucking belonged to.  Yeah, I guess.  That's what my cock does.  Hogs, warts.  Doesn't give them to anybody else.  They had little girls crying because they couldn't get close enough to the rails. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, boy.  They were holding them back from the stars.  And they couldn't see them anyway.  They were little dots, really, for most of the people around that area.  They showed the picture of a young Harry Potter from the first movie and what he looks like now.  And that is just an entire career of doing that character.  Well, how long has it been?  Oh, fuck.  How long has it been?  Ten years? 
[01:26:00]  Ten fucking years?  I remember my ex used to drag me to these dumb movies.  And I've been out of that fucking relationship for a long time.  Holy shit.  Wow.  So, it's been ten years?  Has it?  Yeah.  You know, you're not socializing.  Ten years.  You know, you're not socializing with anybody.  Socializing?  We're waiting to go into a movie.  What am I supposed to say?  Oh, well.  You know, you just...  Oh.  I have nothing in common with these people.  What am I supposed to say? 
[01:26:30]  That's the original...  That can't be the same guy.  He was a little, like, little kid.  It was just...  Oh, look.  He's got his little round glasses.  And now he's just a man.  A hairy man.  That's the same kid.  That's the same fucking guy.  We switch him out, and we don't know.  Yeah, right?  Wow.  Yeah, you look at the first one, and he's just like the little Harry Potter.  Wow.  And he's big, manly, has to shave twice a day. 
[01:27:00]  Probably, right?  To keep the girls from going, ew, he's a man.  All right, well.  Yeah, I'm going to go, though.  Going to that one?  I'll check it out.  I have never seen one.  I heard they're good movies, and Lord of the Rings are good.  I've never seen them, either.  Lord of the Rings.  I have them.  I should watch them.  Great.  You should check out Lord of the Rings, if you have a good system, especially.  I think you do.  I'll watch it on a plane.  Peter Jackson in the middle of...  Not in the middle.  At the beginning, filming The Hobbit right now. 
[01:27:30]  And I follow Elijah Wood now.  And he said that they're filming the movie in blocks.  Where's that?  The Hobbit.  It's a place in...  Shit.  It's so they don't burn...  It's such a giant fucking movie that it's so they don't burn everybody out this time around.  They're doing, like, a segment, and then they'll take off from, like, now until the end of September. 
[01:28:00]  And then go back.  Oh, wow.  And film another place and another location.  They scout locations during that.  Peter Jackson does, like, a kind of a primitive edit of the first pieces.  And then they do it again, the second block, and then a third block.  And it just looks like it's going to be another one of these huge, cool, epic fucking movies.  And who do you follow on Twitter?  Elijah Wood.  And do the puppet master. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, I saw the, uh...  What?  What?  You don't know what that is.  No, I...  You have no idea what that is.  I saw him tweet something about that.  He has?  Right?  And do the puppet master.  What am I missing?  You're missing a lot.  Compassion.  Right?  Sobriety.  Uh, hope.  Um...  The puppet master. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, okay.  Hey, everybody!  It's Dancy Dance Time!  I love Dancy Dance Time!  From Gabba Gabba Hay!  Let's see who our Dancy Dance Friend is today!  Dancy Dance Friend.  I watch about three hours of this a day.  Oh, hey, everyone!  Um, I'm Elijah.  Hi, Elijah!  Hi!  I want to show you how to do my Dancy Dance.  We're all going to learn it together.  Oh, boy.  It's called the puppet master.  And this is how you do it.  We're all going to pretend that we have strings on our hands, our knees, and our feet. 
[01:29:30]  Oh.  Are you ready?  Let's try.  Oh, no.  Raise your knee.  Raise your knee.  Raise your other knee.  Raise your other knee.  Raise your foot.  Raise your foot.  Raise your other foot.  Raise your other foot.  Walk in a circle.  Walk in a circle.  Do the puppet master.  Yes, thanks.  That's great, everyone.  Are you shitting me?  Yeah!  Raise your knee.  Raise your other knee.  Raise your foot.  Raise your other foot.  Walk in a circle. 
[01:30:00]  Do the puppet master.  Raise your knee.  Raise your other knee.  Raise your foot.  And what do kids do when they watch this?  They bounce on your lap.  Oh, I'm not you, Uncle Paul.  I don't want to know from you.  It always ends up with clear stuff.  They step on you, you know what.  Oh, my God.  The repetition is killing me.  Raise your other foot.  Walk in a circle.  Do the puppet master.  Raise your knee.  Raise your other knee.  Raise your foot.  It just keeps going. 
[01:30:30]  Raise your other foot.  Walk in a circle.  That's why I brought it up.  So you know my pain now.  Now imagine hearing this probably, at this point, 25 times.  25 times easy on this one song alone.  I guess.  If you're watching it.  For a 14-month-old, he likes it.  Now, let's go crazy!  What?  What?  Pulls out a gun and just starts shooting them all.  It's crazy.  Start rubbing his dick on the puppets.  Go crazy.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Yay!  Everybody's dancing. 
[01:31:00]  He's going crazy.  Oh, that was so much fun.  No, it wasn't.  Thanks for having me, guys.  But I've got to go.  Oh, they're going to beam him away.  Oh, there they go.  Oh, my God.  They vaporized him.  Yeah.  What did they do?  They executed him.  Yeah.  Yo Gabba Gabba.  Yeah.  They're good at...  Biz Markie was on Yo Gabba Gabba.  What did he do?  They're good at coming up with songs that have four words.  And then those four words are said over and over and over again.  I'm the beatboxer, Biz Markie. 
[01:31:30]  And my cool trick is making more than one sound with my mouth at one time.  Check it out.  I'm Biz Markie, the human-owned guy.  Cool tricks!  Cool tricks!  I'm going to do it for you one more time slower. 
[01:32:00]  Can you do that?  Where's the motherfucking two short?  Cool tricks!  Cool tricks!  I'm Biz Markie and making more than one sound with my mouth is my cool trick.  Bye-bye.  You got one with me.  Oh, baby, you.  It's a good song.  It's great.  He was trending on Twitter yesterday.  Really?  And someone said, his mouth looks like he has Brontosaurus DNA.  I fucking hate him.  He really does.  I don't know the exact tweet. 
[01:32:30]  If you can find it real fast, Sam.  But someone tweeted that his mouth is so brutal that he must have Brontosaurus DNA.  Brontosaurus DNA.  I can't imagine having to watch these.  Oh, these kid shows are brutal, man.  I drove home from Soda's Point five straight hours, and the kid is finally able to watch TV in the car,  so it's the Yo Gabba Gabba over and over again.  Oh, no, no.  Yes, yes.  I can't imagine.  But we figured out, and we're going to try this next time, 
[01:33:00]  we're going to throw Family Guy fucking shows on.  Might as well.  It's cartoons.  Cartoons.  He'll just watch the cartoons.  He'll enjoy that.  Right?  You better hope so.  Instead of singing these same Yo Gabba Gabba songs over and over again.  Yo Gabba Gabba.  And do the Puppet Master.  He did tweet something about that, but I had no idea what it was.  But that's it?  Wow.  There's a party in my tummy.  Yeah?  Yep.  Is everyone coming? 
[01:33:30]  That old gag.  There's a party in my tummy.  Bismarcky's mouth looks like he has Brontosaurus in his DNA.  There you go.  That made me fucking howl yesterday.  Out of this world.  That's funny, man.  See, there was one day I was staying over a house, and there was family and kids and stuff  like that.  And I was watching something on television.  And then the mom just comes in and goes, yep, click, click, click, click, DVD goes in, 
[01:34:00]  and now there's like shit.  Fucking Bob the Builder or some shit came on.  And all I could think is, I was watching something.  Yeah.  You mean the kids didn't want to watch the fall of the Third Reich?  See why you were crying?  Cheese.  Cheese.  Do the puppet dance. 
[01:34:30]  Isn't it all the same fucking tune?  And what is that thing supposed to be?  I don't know.  It's green.  It's striped.  I know Muno looks like a dick or a dildo.  And that's the only one I know.  Oh, what happened to the carrots and the asparagus?  And Roby, right?  Why can't they join the party? 
[01:35:00]  I don't know.  Does the asparagus sing, we make your piss smell horrible?  Horrible.  The party in your tummy.  Carrots want to go to the party in my tummy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, well, do green beans want to go to the party in my tummy?  Yeah.  This knife did.  Okay.  Let's go.  Paint chips.  Carrots.  Yeah.  In my tummy.  Party, party.  Yeah.  In my tummy. 
[01:35:30]  Green beans.  Yeah.  Yes.  Beans dissolved by stomach acids.  Yeah.  And I just have one thing to say to you.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because you don't understand this?  No, I have no.  Try it.  You'll like it.  Try it.  You'll like it.  Yeah.  Try it.  You'll like it.  Try it.  I'll like it.  Yes.  Try it.  You'll like it. 
[01:36:00]  I, uh, see, I, I don't, I don't know.  Try it.  You'll like it.  Oh, boy.  He can't, uh...  Oh, boy.  I don't think Sam is very good at it.  Sam's snake.  Oh.  Oh, this is a video of a TV with some kid fucking screaming in the background.  Right.  That's not Barney.  Barney's old school.  Sam's just not on board with this bit with me.  Now you're going to get to an old, now you're going to get to an old Alka-Seltzer commercial, 
[01:36:30]  which I remember as a child.  Wow.  Try it.  You'll like it.  Yeah.  I tried it.  Thought I was going to die.  Took two Alka-Seltzer.  It would have been nice.  And then the song would have played, tried to like it.  Yeah.  And then you say, I tried it, I like it.  I tried it, I like it.  I tried it, I like it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe you shouldn't teach a kid that.  I know, man.  Sure you should.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Never say no. 
[01:37:00]  Always mind your manners.  Yeah.  We're your adult friends.  I'm here to pick you up.  Let me say hi to Doug in Rhode Island.  Doug?  Yeah, hey, how you doing?  Hey, man.  Listen, I don't know about you, but I have a two-year-old,  and I get stuck watching Yo Gabba Gabba,  and DJ Lance Rock, if he is not a pedophile waiting to be convicted,  I just don't know who is.  Oh, well.  Yeah.  I can give you a guess.  What's your favorite Yo Gabba Gabba song?  There's many to choose from. 
[01:37:30]  Many of them.  I like, I love Bugs.  I love Bugs is pretty damn good.  I love Bugs.  Yeah.  I love Bugs.  Just say I love Bugs over and over again.  You got the song in.  Is that it?  Pretty much.  Here it is.  I love Bugs so much.  I love Bugs.  See, these are shitty fucking videos.  They're not even good songs.  I love Bugs.  I love Bugs.  If you ever want to torture somebody,  make them happen to watch a Cool Tricks, Cool Tricks.  You can't get that out of your head.  No, it's not Cool Tricks, Cool Tricks. 
[01:38:00]  Cool Tricks, Cool Tricks.  That's pretty crazy.  Let me say hi to Jake in Jersey, Jake.  The budget's got to be 10 bucks on this show.  I know.  Barney, too.  Those are those shows.  This is fucking amazing, me.  Yeah.  Is Barney still on, or no one gives a fuck about him anymore?  No.  That's an ant.  What's that?  That's an ant.  And it's called on the ground.  What's it doing?  It's drinking.  It's driving really fast.  It's called on the ground.  That one character is ribbed for her pleasure. 
[01:38:30]  That's why I said it.  Yeah.  That's Muno.  Muno is a fucking studded dildo.  Sure.  Is the other thing supposed to be a cat?  Let's say hi to Jake in Jersey.  Jake.  Hey, boys.  What's going on?  Hey, Jake.  Opie, I just want to say how much I hate you right now.  Yeah, I know.  A lot of people do.  My five-year-olds finally grew out of this stuff, and I haven't had a watch in the past  six months, and now you've got it stuck right in my goddamn head again.  All I have to say to you is don't bite your friends. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, no.  Is there a song about not biting your friends?  If Sam was a little faster on the fucking YouTube, we would be all over this.  Don't bite your friends.  You got that one?  Oh, it's a TV version.  Another TV version.  Another good version.  Yes, Sam.  Hello again.  Hey, everyone's coming together right now.  Nice guy.  That's Lance.  DJ Lance.  I'm going to let my kid watch this. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, my God.  It's a butt plug.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  The dildo just bit the fucking miscarriage.  Hey, if you bite Kloofa, we don't ever want to bite our friends.  Do you have to tell people this?  One, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Don't bite your friends.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't bite your friends.  We don't bite our friends. 
[01:40:00]  No way.  We don't pull the hair.  Bite your enemies.  Friends are our friends.  That's right.  So we treat them with care.  Yeah.  So don't.  And less they're different colors.  Don't.  Then we ostracize and throw things at them.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't bite your friends.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't bite your friends.  Don't.  Don't bite your friends.  Don't bite your friends.  We don't want to hurt.  Uh-uh.  We don't want to bite.  Uh-uh.  We don't.  Yeah, don't bite your friends.  You're not going to starve then because pizza's his friend and heroes are his friend. 
[01:40:30]  Sorry, Iraq.  You know what this show needs?  What?  Jumpy jump time.  No.  No, there can't be jumpy jump time.  I think this show needs jumpy jump time.  Is this part of the exercise portion of?  Alex knows what I'm talking about.  Alex, do you think this show needs jumpy jump time?  Hell yeah, you need some jumpy jump time.  Yeah?  Hold on, man.

Look for this.  Hey. 
[01:41:30]  Shut the fuck up and lay down quiet.  Shut the fuck up and lay down quiet.  Shut the fuck up and lay down quiet.  Don't shit your pants.  Don't shit your pants.  Don't put shit in your diapers and get all over daddy's hands.  Don't shit your pants.  Oh, shake the baby.  Shake the baby.  Shake the baby really hard.  Jimmy's onto something.  That's how easy it is to do a kid's show.  You know how much fucking money you can make? 
[01:42:00]  You know how much parents would love you for that?  Oh, yeah.  Parents would love you.  Don't shit your pants.  Don't cry at all.  Don't cry at all.  Just bite the pillow.  Don't cry at all.  Just bite the pillow.  Let me say hi to Clinton in Virginia.  Clinton.  Hi.  Hey, guys.  Just pull up.  I'm so glad I've got skin.  What?  It's about a guy with an unclipped cock.  He's peeling his foreskin back and forth over the head of his dick, and it's making the fruit roll-up sound. 
[01:42:30]  I'm so glad I got skin.  And then the circumcised cock is looking all silly and cold.  Oh, my God.  I figured we could do something with this today.  This is...  I can't...  Oh, this guy howled when you said...  This guy cried when Ant said the dildo beat the miscarriage.  Or bit, it should be, I guess. 
[01:43:00]  Why?  It's...  It's...  No, I wouldn't be able to watch this.  I'm so glad I got hair, I got hair, I got hair.  I'm so glad I got hair.  Well, feel about it funny with nothing up there.  Nothing up there, nothing up there.  Feel about it funny with nothing up there.  Nothing down there.  Nothing down there.  I'm so glad I got eyes, I got eyes, I got eyes.  I'm so glad I got eyes.  When it gets sad, I can always cry, always cry, always cry.  What about people with no eyes? 
[01:43:30]  I can't wait until they get to that other part.  I know.  I'm so glad I got melanin.  I'm so glad I got melanin.  I'm so glad I got a nose in the nose.  That's like one of my toes.  One of my toes.  Let's be honest.  That was a little bigger.  That's like one of my toes.  Yes.  I'm so glad I got teeth.  I got teeth.  I got teeth.  So am I.  At least we can see you at night.  I'm so glad I got a candy. 
[01:44:00]  I'm so glad I got a candy.  1970s stereotyping.  I'm so glad I can dance naturally.  I'm so glad I can run real fast.  I'm so glad I got teeth.  I got teeth.  I got teeth.  I'm so glad they don't fail me now.  Oh, Jesus.  Yes, Jimmy.  I'm so glad.  I'm so glad.  Oh, what?  Oh, you want?  I'm so glad I got skin.  That's what keeps my insides in. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  Insides in.  I just wish it was white.  It doesn't even go with this song.  I got a face.  I got a face.  I got a face.  I'm so glad.  I got a face.  Why do the police always squirt it with mace?  Human race.  Human race.  Human race.  Human race.  Human race.  Human race.  Why do people yell things about my race?  Human race.  Human race.  Human race.  I am a member of a human race.  At least for a couple of hundred years.  I'm so glad.  I got it going.  I'm so glad. 
[01:45:00]  I got it going.  Wow.  That was the shit parents have to deal with that.  That's what they.  That's what they.  You want to do jumpy jump time or what?  Jumpy jump time.  I'd love to.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Went to fly today.  I love jumping before I fly.  Tuckers me out.  Oh, yeah.  Don't forget business beat of the day.  There was a Jack Black episode of Yo Gabba Gabba.  Oh, I bet it was hilarious because he's just the best.  Yeah.  He does that funny like wink thing.  Oh. 
[01:45:30]  Isn't he great?  Isn't he just great?  Oh, he is.  He's probably making a weird face.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm so glad.  He's an uncharismatic fat man.  It's Jack Black on Yo Gabba Gabba.  Behind the scenes.  What?  We don't need behind the scenes.  I don't want behind the scenes.  There are adults doing this?  Yeah.  What the fuck is going on?  Yes.  It's a big business, huh?  Huh?  Big business?  Yeah.  Hey, it leads to this children's book that is on the bestsellers list. 
[01:46:00]  I sure wish Sam would die.  I sure wish that Sam would die.  I sure wish Iraq wouldn't eat.  I sure wish Iraq wouldn't eat.  Sorry, Iraq.  Oh, what does Sam do?  I don't know.  Because he's not going fast enough.  Oh, Sam.  See what happens there when you don't go fast enough.  I sure hope Danny's thing because he has cancer.  I sure hope Danny's thing because he has cancer.  I sure hope Travis gets eczema in his beard.  Did we do dancey dance time? 
[01:46:30]  Did we cover dancey dance?  Oh, there's so many.  I know.  Do you want to do dancey dance time?  Why wouldn't I?  This is alien to me.  Hey, everybody.  Razzle Dazzle.  I sure wish I liked girls.  Hi, everybody.  My name's Leslie. 
[01:47:00]  You're fat.  And I want to teach you all a dancey dance.  It's called Do the Ugly Far-Headed Bitch.  First, I want to bring in some of my special friends.  What?  Oh.  The black girl that was just on us.  This is DJ Rora and the Junior Gems.  Now, the dancey dance I'm going to teach you is called Razzle Dazzle.  Razzle Dazzle.  Glitter hands.  Glitter hands. 
[01:47:30]  Then we're going this way to that way.  Like a pendulum.  Over here and over there.  Over here.  Over there.  This side.  Yeah.  Then this side.  This side.  This side.  Laser beam up.  She is a fucking pig.  Laser beam up.  Laser beam up.  Razzle Dazzle.  Razzle Dazzle.  All right.  I think you're ready.  Yeah.  Let's do it, everybody.  I know.  Here we go.  Glitter hands, glitter hands, glitter hands, glitter hands. 
[01:48:00]  Glitter hands, glitter hands.  Razzle Dazzle.  Glitter hands, glitter hands, glitter hands, glitter hands.  Razzle Dazzle.  Razzle Dazzle.  Glitter hands, glitter hands, glitter hands.  Glitter hands, glitter hands.  Razzle Dazzle.  Razzle Dazzle.  Glitter hands, glitter hands, glitter hands.  Glitter hands, glitter hands.  Razzle Dazzle.  Razzle Dazzle.  That was awesome.  Awesome.  Awesome.  Now, let's go.  Oh, they all go crazy at the end? 
[01:48:30]  Is that what happened?  That's part of the dance to dance time.  Oh.  Yeah.  What awful kids they have on this show.  Razzle dazzle.  Razzle dazzle.  It's my time to leave.  Razzle dazzle.  Yeah, well, it leads to this book that's out called Go the Fuck to Sleep.  Oh.  A children's book that has a buzz out there, Ant.  Oh, wait.  What's this one? 
[01:49:00]  Ting Ting.  Oh, you like the Ting Ting?  Oh, who doesn't like the Ting Ting?  Doing their Happy Birthday song.  This is the Happy Birthday song?  Happy, happy birthday in a warm bath through those nights, nights, nights.  Yeah.  Look at her ass.  Who, the one dancing in the back?  No.  The guy on the guitar.  The guy on the guitar.  Who does she sound like?  Listen persons?  Anybody else?  A little. 
[01:49:30]  A little bit?  A little, yeah.  Why are you trying to come up with a new Happy Birthday song?  It's never going to happen.  Happy Birthday.  And she's got her hairdo from fucking...  Yeah.  Blondie in 1972 or something.  Berlin.  Oh, yeah.  The singer of Berlin had that hairdo.  Yeah.  It's kind of a cool song, actually.  Say bye, brother.  They do get some good music acts on Yo Gabba Gabba.  Who is that one?  That's Ting Ting.  Ting Ting.  Who is she?  Oh, my God.  She's Ting Ting. 
[01:50:00]  They should have got the Pogues.  That's not my name.  Oh, they brush your teeth.  That's not my name.  Why are they...  Oh, that's an average Heisman.  Yeah, well...  I see.  It's not my name, Yo Gabba Gabba Remix.  And it's...  And it's Breaking Bad commercial.  Well, these videos do very well on YouTube.  Do they?  Yes, they do.  It's crazy.  Yeah.  2.7 almost million views on that Happy Birthday video.  Damn.  That's not my name.  That's not my name.  Play the Ducks are.  We don't have time to play it. 
[01:50:30]  Everyone wants to hear so much of this.  Hey, so Sam Jackson, Ant, read from this book.  It's a real children's book out right now.  It's a real children's book.  And it's called Go the Fuck to Sleep.  How is that possible?  Why is there a tranny on the front?  And it made a bestsellers list or something.  It did it?  Yeah, the book is selling very well.  So you want to hear this?  So someone got the book and gave it to Sam Jackson and said,  could you read from this book? 
[01:51:00]  So he's actually reading from the book.  This is a legitimate book.  Reading, really reading from the book.  Yes.  Okay.  The cats nestle close to their kittens.  The lambs have laid down with the sheep.  You're cozy and warm in your bed, my dear.  Please, go the fuck to sleep.  The windows are dark in the town, child.  The whales huddle down in the deep. 
[01:51:30]  I'll read you one very last book if you swear.  You'll go the fuck to sleep.  The eagles who soar through the sky are at rest, and the creatures who crawl, run, and creep.  I know you're not thirsty.  That's bullshit.  Stop lying.  Lie the fuck down, my darling.  And sleep. 
[01:52:00]  How is this book sold?  Huh?  How are they selling that book?  I don't know.  I think it's...  I think it's a...  Kids.  Parents got a sense of humor.  Do you know how many...  But do you know how many people are going to put this on for their guests?  And it's going to get like a laugh the first time.  Right.  And then it just goes on and on.  And it goes on.  And it's the same punchline.  Yeah, okay.  Go the fuck to sleep.  They own it.  They own it.  They own it.  We got it.  We heard it.  They own it.  They own it.  From Africa.  From Africa.  I wasn't talking to you. 
[01:52:30]  I wasn't talking to you.  Yeah, I think it is the same punchline.  It's like three more minutes of that.  Oh, I don't doubt it.  Listen, I was...  I guess we're trying to move on.  But this guy, Michael C.  Mike?  He says, the best is the Yo Gabba Gabba song in the car episode where Fufa, that's that  pink thing that looks a little...  Fufa the dildo?  A little tubby.  Yeah.  The pink butt plug, I think one of you guys said.  Oh, pink butt plug.  Okay.  Is too fat to get the seatbelt to fit, and they sing, don't stop, don't give up, keep 
[01:53:00]  trying.  Keep trying?  Yes.  Do you have that one, and then we can finally end the misery?  Hmm.  Keep trying.  Oh, he's having a hard time.  Oh, God.  He's trying.  Yo Gabba.  We don't have it.  Keep trying.  No.  I got a bunch of babies watching it.  Oh, boy.  So, I guess this is going to have a dead end.  So, what?  The bosses are watching it?  Is that what you meant? 
[01:53:30]  See?  Because they're babies.  Did you just mention the bosses?  For a second.  Oh, shit.  How long?  If we go to breaks, they're not too bad.  All right.  Yeah.  You know that one of the bosses...  Uh-oh.  See, you can't mention the bosses.  One of the bosses.  Just don't do it.  I just popped out.  What happened?  He's on an African safari as we sit here and sweat for this fucking company.  Really?  Yes.  For...  Oh, good.  That's great for us. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, it is great for us.  Wait, which boss?  Yeah.  It's not important to be here as the whole company's falling apart.  Lions.  I need to be on an elephant checking out fucking lions.  In the safari.  Try to negotiate his way out of warlords beheading him.  You did not get...  No, no.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  In some big black steel pot with fire burning under it as they're cooking him.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  You have to talk to the attorneys. 
[01:54:30]  Talk to the lawyers.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You mean they'll just save my bad mood?  I'm not officially in a bad mood.  Here they are.  What are you doing?  The water's getting hot.  The vision of him in a big fucking pot.  A pot.  You know what this tribe needs?  The market is better.  Yeah, yeah.  What do we got?  What do we got?  I know it's going to work.  We'll get something together with you guys.  I want to get the warlords and I want to get them some wireless microphones.  I want them in the middle of the Serengeti.  How does this sound to you?  Savage 202.  Well, I'm going to give you your own channel.  Yeah. 
[01:55:00]  That'd be great.  You could do the de-clitting live on the air.  No, no, no.  I got it.  I got it.  It'd be great.  It'd be great.  The lawyers won't allow that, sir.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is this from Yon?  That would be Yon.  I would so want to do that show.  What?  Yon. 
[01:55:30]  I can't hear you.  I'm not going to say it.  It's used in a derogatory way.  Yon?  Yes.  But the...  But the same songs and the same characters.  But the spelling where it won't get your teeth knocked out, right?  Of course.  Yes.  Because that would go with Gabba.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, that would be hilarious.  This is the joyous music of, yes, clitoral circumcision.  Yes.  Oh, why?  Is it with Fitty?  That's good that you got a shower.  That's good. 
[01:56:00]  That looks natural.  Not Jimmy's piss.  That looks natural and comfortable.  That looked like a robbery in progress.  Yeah, that looks good.  Boss with Fitty's scent.  That's cool.  That's what people want to say.  What's wrong with that?  No, it's great.  That's exactly...  That looks right.  That doesn't look like an executive just fucking pushing his face and representing the wall.  That looks good.  Very natural.  Stop.  It's all right.  The signal doesn't hit Africa.  Yeah.  This is very uncomfortable to be in such a good mood.  You got to stop. 
[01:56:30]  You mentioned bosses, though.  He's probably buying a bunch of blood diamonds.  Boy, that's good.  There's a picture of fucking...  He's probably getting a bunch of blood diamonds so he could give it to Howard.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He demanded them.  That's great.  That's cool.  There's Bladder about to be attacked.  How great is that shot of Bladder trying to have his hoodie on to look like one of the gangbangers?  Yeah.  Oh, Bladder.  What's that a picture with?  50 Cent and his crew.  And the whole crew? 
[01:57:00]  Oh, that's not 50 Cent?  G-Unit.  That's 50 Cent.  That's not Shade 45, because I don't see Eminem in that picture.  Oh, well, let's see.  Oh, that's right.  He shows up once...  Yeah, he wasn't there for that.  He has never been in this building since we started broadcasting.  He's like Haley's Comet.  Every 75 years, you might see him.  You think Steve talks to the Shade people the same way?  They say something...  I don't think so.  Or they say something, and his answer is a...  It's just a wrinkled nose and a nod. 
[01:57:30]  Are you saying that's what he does?  Is that his tail?  And I know that nobody can see this.  Is that his tail?  Yeah.  We know Scott's tail is, I got it, I got it, I got it, which means he doesn't got it at all.  I got it, I got it, I got it.  Yeah.  Oh, it's Scott?  Oh, I didn't think of that.  Wow.  Oh, man.  Yeah, I guess he's in Africa for a couple weeks.  All right.  Doing a safari.  We're better off, certainly.  A little malaria.  He's trying to get the Amistad rebuilt. 
[01:58:00]  Where can I send somebody?  He's talking to the guys who built the Amistad.  He's like, how did you get them to sign contracts for that kind of money?  Yeah, come on, tell me.  What?  Please.  Do you think he shits diamonds?  No.  No.  Over there?  It's going to be shitting fucking water.  I can't imagine what it would be like to...  You're going to get sick.  Probably, yeah.  Although you get a lot of shots going over there, too. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, you certainly hope so.  Yeah, right now, I hope for his sake there isn't a mosquito that just fucking bit some tribesman  and lands on him.  Here you go.  Here, take this with you.  You have a little malaria.  I got it, I got it, I got it.  You should do.  I got it.  Malaria.  Yeah.  I've heard a rumor.  Is he over there, or are we just making all this up?  He is over there?  I would never, I'd be scared to go there, to be honest.  Africa.  Although, the amount of money he has, he's going on a probably a safari that's safe.  Yeah.  Or, like, the Ivory Coast? 
[01:59:00]  I wouldn't want to go.  Although, a safari would be fine.  Go to Somalia.  Do you think he's going to go, like, elephant hunting or something?  Oh, just shooting fucking endangered animals?  He seems like one of those guys.  Poacher.  Fucking lions.  They put one elephant in a tiny pen and go, okay, have at it.  Just blast them.  Right.  Fuck.  He seems like he's one of those guys.  Big elephant head on his wall when we go in for a meeting.  Right.  And the elephant's like, what do you want from me?  What do you want from me? 
[01:59:30]  You must have hated this.  All right.  Did you ever see the elephant video that pissed off a lot of people?  Was it that guy, that CEO?  It was an executive CEO.  Go Daddy?  Go Daddy guy.  But the second part of that video is fascinating because then the villagers have at the elephant  and come out of the woodwork to take everything away.  Have you seen this video yet, Anne?  No.  Where are you with the hunting thing?  You personally can't do it, right?  Yeah.  I personally don't like hunting, but I don't give a shit.  Where I'm at, I don't mind if you hunt whatsoever, except for these fucking twats that are hunting 
[02:00:00]  in a closed environment like that where the animal has no chance at all.  I hate that.  That's not real hunting.  Here's the second half of the video where after the Go Daddy guy shot the elephant,  the villagers come out of the woodwork to take every piece of the animal away.  He said he did it because it was terrorizing the village and stepping on their crops.  How about you let them take care of it, you fucking white executive cunt?  I hate hunters.  He just likes shooting.  But not guys who hunt and eat.  There's guys that will shoot deer, bring it home. 
[02:00:30]  Like Uncle Ted.  Well, yeah, but you know what?  I understand it as a sport.  I don't mind that.  I really do.  It's not a sport, though.  To me, either punch the thing in the face or give it a gun because it's not a sport.  Some fucking bored twat standing there with a fucking orange hunting hat so his faggot  drunk friend doesn't shoot him.  I gotta wear an orange hat so my drunk faggot friend doesn't shoot me.  Nice hat, dick.  But guys that eat what they shoot, I don't have a problem with.  Like, guys that are hunting to eat is one thing, but these fucking sportsmen that go 
[02:01:00]  and just want to hunt big game are fucking cunts.  But they hunt them in a closed environment.  That's where you lose me.  I don't mind if they're hunting in the natural environment of the animal.  Yeah, because something could jump out and kill you, too.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't mind.  I don't mind.  It's not my thing, but...  How about your fucking...  Oh, Jimmy.  You're stalking an animal and a fucking cheetah runs you down and just rips your throat out.  Jimmy might have turned me a little bit.  If you're one of these hunting guys and you're brave, they should make it illegal to wear 
[02:01:30]  bright orange outfits.  Yeah.  So you go in there.  You gotta wear antlers.  Right.  Then we'll see how many people want to hunt.  Wear a deer suit and go hunting.  That's the only way you're allowed to hunt.  I just hate someone that really feels like they've accomplished something when they throw  it on the front of their truck.  Nah, look what I did.  Yeah.  Really?  Why don't you go home and just eat your wife's pussy properly?  Why don't you do that?  Are you a fan of the orange gear?  No, I think it's stupid.  I think it looks pretty silly.  I think it's stupid.  I think it's hilarious when people get accidentally shot hunting. 
[02:02:00]  It's hilarious.  It constantly happens.  Well, we were going for a bear, but then Herb got too loaded and shot me in the colon.  Good.  That's what you deserve.  Fucking asshole.  Amy, a rifle at a bear?  Why?  Why?  Because you're emasculated at home?  You gotta feel like you beat something?  Well, the bear walked across the yard.  That's why.  That's that.  You don't allow a bear to walk across your yard, Jimmy?  No.  That's almost different.  If a bear's in your yard, I get shooting it. 
[02:02:30]  I really do.  There's a bear.  There's a bear.  You can't reason with it.  There's a bear.  There's a bear in my yard.  There's a bear.  There's a bear.  There's a bear in my yard.  See, that's the rhythm of every fucking song right there.  Like when Ted Nugent took that fucking kid who had to make a wish and his wish was to  shoot a bear.  How about this?  No.  What?  Are you gonna take the bear with you?  You selfish little fuck?  I'm sorry you got cancer.  That's sad.  Why do you have to bring the animal with you?  Why does the bear have to suffer?  Yeah.  He has perfect DNA.  Why don't you wish for something nice, you little faggot?  Get a fucking, get a wish for a dead bear to go with you? 
[02:03:00]  Is that what really happened?  Yeah.  So whatever the kid had.  I don't know which one of them.  I don't care that he was a kid who was sick.  I feel bad for him.  I feel bad for the kid, but that's a little rough.  But too bad you want to go shoot a bear.  How about this?  Tough shit.  Go fuck yourself.  You know why?  Because you're going bye-bye in the box.  You got to bring the fucking big animal that didn't do anything to you?  Well, maybe he wants a nice rug to lay on.  It's his dream.  It bugs me.  I just hate.  Because there's something bullying about it.  And I just, it brings out that part of me that I fucking so much hate guys that do that.  Yeah.  Hate them. 
[02:03:30]  A lot of hunters love you though, Jimmy.  I don't dislike people that-  You're bumming them out today.  I don't care.  People that hunt, like I said, Ted Nugent hunts and he eats with, that's not wasting the animal.  You know, because you get some food out of it.  But guys that fucking hunt and waste the animal, I just, I cannot stomach them.  These fucking rich big game hunters.  Ah.  These fucking hunt bankers.  There I was.  What about the guys that kill a buck and then realize, I ain't dragging this shit out of  the woods.  So they take a couple pictures and just leave it there.  Do you guys really get it? 
[02:04:00]  Ah, maybe.  Ah, there they're just-  Maybe.  Some guys don't want to drag it up and down a few hills to get it back to the road.  Just fucking leave it there.  I don't give a shit.  Get a couple pictures, Herb.  Yeah.  What was his name?  Some pictures.  I don't remember.  No, your fake hunter?  I don't remember.  Herb?  Maybe, yeah.  I don't remember.  Well, I'd hold them by the antlers and you'd take some pictures and then we'll just fucking  chop them up.  Leave them here.  Just leave them here.  Fuck it.  We'll take the antlers.  Yeah, I'm not a hunter guy.  I love shooting, but I like shooting targets. 
[02:04:30]  I like doing drills and things like that.  That's fun.  Coop thinks our racism is going strong.  He hasn't hurt us in a while.  Oh, cool.  We haven't even been racist lately.  Thanks, man.  We don't have time for Coop.  Uh, no.  What should we talk about racism?  I figured we'd leave a little time on his, uh, calling card.  What?  My calling card, Mr. Coonier?  God damn.  I listen to your phone.  I haven't spoken.  I haven't heard of you listening to you guys in about six months. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, shit.  This is my third day listening, and I'm like, I'm thinking Anthony softened a little bit,  so I heard him this morning.  I said, oh, shit.  Yeah, I was thinking I was softening, too, a little bit, so I really poured it on.  What did I say?  Hey, maybe I'm just, like, immune to this at this point.  What did he say that was so bad today?  That goes, by the way.  Hold on, Coop.  I'm going to challenge you right now.  Uh-huh.  What did Anthony say that was racist that goes beyond...  Hold on!  That goes beyond humor.  Look, it's not...  I'm not challenging your humor. 
[02:05:30]  I'm not saying don't say it.  That's why I'm asking the question, sir.  That is racism.  All right.  All right.  What was it?  That is racist.  I would never tell...  I would never say anybody don't say nothing.  You know what I'm saying?  I would never be like, you know, you shouldn't say that that's not me.  Say what you want, but I figure if I'm doing the one-eyebrow raise, when I hear a white guy  say something, I mean, I suspect it's racist.  But mine's comedy racism.  That's right.  Everyone knows I'm goofy and stupid, and, you know, I go home and drink a little too much.  I drive too fast. 
[02:06:00]  I'm, you know, irresponsible.  I'm self-centered.  And then I take all that, and we make fun of it here.  But how about, uh, then I take another part of me, uh, you know, maybe my, uh, my fear  of, uh, certain, uh, ethnic backgrounds, and then I change that into, into comedy.  What about that?  That's, uh, that's not okay, though?  But everything else that I goof on myself, when I goof on myself about, that's fine.  But when I goof on, uh, anything that maybe hits home to you?  Yeah, but look, I never said anything you said. 
[02:06:30]  Anything that hits, what, it hit a little too close to projects?  The projects.  See, get it?  Too close to home?  You can't help it.  I didn't get it.  I'm fucking with you, man.  I'd be fucking, I'd be fucking with you.  That's great.  I'm just, look, like I said, the African pot thing, when you said the big black pot, and  then you followed it with savages, that wasn't enough.  And I said, listen, I have to say something.  But that, you know what that is?  That came from cartoons.  I'm going to explain.  Okay, go ahead.  But that's African.  Go ahead.  By the way, we're watching an elephant get fucking chopped into tiny little pieces as 
[02:07:00]  Coop is talking about.  Yeah.  With axes, by the way.  So what happened, though?  What about the big pot?  I've come to understand why people call it in certain words you say, or straight, just  mean niggas without saying niggas.  Savage.  No, no, no.  I use the word savage for people that act like savages.  Don't you dare take savage.  See, you can't turn that around.  You can never turn that around.  Don't take savage from me, please.  I love using that.  I yell at cab drivers.  I yell at cab drivers and call them savage.  I don't even know where they're from. 
[02:07:30]  We're looking at a video right now.  How would you describe that?  Ants pulling apart a cricket.  That's what it looks like.  But it's a bunch of...  Black people.  These are a bunch of people in Africa ripping apart an elephant carcass and leaving nothing.  Ripping it apart, by the way.  No organization whatsoever.  No, no.  So what were you saying, sir?  I'm sorry.  Like I said, you made the same reference about ants pulling apart a cricket to black people.  But I don't know.  I've said that forever. 
[02:08:00]  And I understand that we live in a context of racism, white supremacy.  Why?  All of that shit.  Do we?  Yes.  White people dominate everything.  That's racist.  I don't think so.  Well, we've done a pretty good job of this country, to tell you the truth.  Prove to me where white people don't dominate.  Let me ask you this question.  Well, I think white people being in charge of the country here has done pretty good over  the past couple of hundred years.  What?  The world?  I'm not talking about the country.  I'm talking about the world.  The world?  How is white people? 
[02:08:30]  White people are the minority in the world.  White people are the minority in this world.  Okay.  I know that.  I'm not denying that.  So what the fuck?  How can you be a supremacist?  That must be white people are amazingly smart and intuitive, ingenuity.  Divide and conquer.  What?  You use deception and you divide and conquer.  Deception, divide and conquer.  Yes.  Why don't you guys...  That's how you control a large group of people is you confuse them and you divide them. 
[02:09:00]  Well, why can't...  Well, then why doesn't Africa unite and become a powerhouse and build like rockets and missiles  and shit like that?  I'm going to say, I'll be honest with you.  The racist white supremacists that govern the planet are the smartest people in the known universe.  Yeah.  And I have no problem saying that because for people...  People...  They don't...  They don't...  They don't...  They don't...  They don't... 
[02:09:30]  They don't...  They don't...  They don't...  They don't...  Well...  Okay.  Take Africa, right?  Mm-hmm.  It's probably one of the most fertile...  On the globe.  It's full of riches and just amazing soil.  And not in all the places.  I know.  You know, you got the Sahara and everything like that.  And there's some pretty bad places down south, too.  But how come there isn't this uniting and making that place just a powerhouse of a continent? 
[02:10:00]  Because, as I said, the racist white supremacists...  Now, without blaming white people, take the black...  I cannot explain that...  Well, how could you blame black...  How could you blame white people when all black people are there?  Again, I'm going to explain to you.  Okay, go ahead.  Can you stop talking and let me explain that?  All right.  What you do, you send in your missionaries.  Missionaries.  You give them a false sense of God about themselves. 
[02:10:30]  Uh-huh.  And then you divide the people.  You choose who you want to put on a pedestal, and you turn them against the other...  It's sort of...  You know, as a matter of fact, exactly how a slave plantation works back in the day?  The world is in itself a giant slave plantation.  So how come...  Listen...  All right, man.  I'm listening.  I'm listening.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  The way the slave master on a slave plantation had to figure out a way to survive amongst  all those people, him and his wife and maybe his family, a few of them, got maybe 
[02:11:00]  20 to 30 slaves, but had to figure out a way to do it.  And the best way he knew how to do it was to beat the shit out of them.  One, divide them amongst themselves by separating families, taking the light skin, so-called  light skin from the so-called dark skin, and putting the light skin on the pelvis, causing  this whole color confrontation shit, and then you pick the men against the women, and the  children against...  It's a whole fucking system.  So if you see all this...  And that's what the world is.  That's exactly how the world is.  But if you see all this, then why don't you just blow it off and go, okay, that's what 
[02:11:30]  they're doing, hey, let's say fuck them, let's unite as a people, and we have a giant  continent packed with resources, let's become a powerhouse in the world.  First of all, the number one tool they use besides deception, the number one tool in  the deception kit was religion.  They gave everybody, excuse me, they gave the majority of non-white people on the planet  a false image of God. 
[02:12:00]  And that image of God is white.  Yeah.  Don't you think any image of God is false?  Like, African tribes worship what they worship.  Every ancient people and modern people all worship what they worship, but it's all nonsense.  But it doesn't matter whether you believe a God or not.  The point is, these people believed in a God that reflected their own society.  Are you saying to me, hold on, why did they abandon that?  I don't know Jim's question.  Can I answer Jim's question?  No, not for a second.  Let me add something in to Jim's question. 
[02:12:30]  Are you saying that people in Africa were so gullible that they would listen to anything  that a white person said?  I thought this was a continent that was full of princes and kings and, and, uh...  Look, I didn't grow up in Africa.  I didn't grow up back then.  I didn't survive 500 years and watch where this shit comes.  Oh, well, I didn't enslave anyone, so I guess, I guess we're even.  The point is this.  I guess it's a wash.  The world we live in today.  Yeah.  The world we live in today is a, is under a, a global system of racism, white supremacy. 
[02:13:00]  Wow, I don't see that at all.  I'm sorry.  Answer this question, then.  I'm looking at a black president on TV as you say this, by the way.  So show me anywhere on the planet right now or any time in history where non-white people  classified as non-white by the racist white supremacists can force white people to pick  up and move and make a move where military might could go anywhere in the world and make  large groups of white people pick up and move and... 
[02:13:30]  I have my theories, but if I say them, I'm fucked, okay?  Do you understand?  This is my, this is my white, wait, wait, wait, wait.  This is the white supremacist land that you say we live in.  I can't tell what my opinion is on why black, predominantly black nations cannot rise up and  make white people leave and, and, and create a continent of industry and maybe, you know,  become a world powerhouse. 
[02:14:00]  I can't tell you why.  That's how fucked, that's how fucked this, this world is and how white supreme, how supreme  we rule that I will be fired if I give my honest opinion as to why I believe that is  the case.  Thanks.  Thank you.  That is the phoniness of your own system.  It's not the phoniness of my own fucking system.  It's the fucking, it's, it's what you, it's the power.  It's the power you possess.  It's the power you possess. 
[02:14:30]  It's the black supremacy, the black supremacy over my fucking job.  Bullshit.  Bullshit, Coop.  There's black supremacy.  I can't speak my piece without losing my fucking job.  I can't have my, my opinion.  I can't speak my piece as to why I don't think that there is a black nation that is prosperous  and run completely by blacks.  I can't fucking express that because I'll be fired. 
[02:15:00]  Thank you.  Because that is the refinement of the system.  See, 30 years ago, you could have said what you wanted to say.  Yeah.  Yes, I, I, I, I probably could have.  The racist, white supremacist.  And what's changed?  What's changed?  So no one could talk now.  No one could talk now.  But where's, but where's the major, no one could talk now.  But what changed in the fact that where's a, a, a, a powerhouse black nation?  What has what?  I said, things have changed.  We can't talk about it now.  We could 30 years ago. 
[02:15:30]  But since it's changed, why hasn't things changed then, uh, in, uh, in Africa, in sub-Saharan  Africa?  I wanted to tell you the system has refined itself.  Meaning, and please let me explain.  All right.  Meaning.  Explain.  It is tacky to openly say nigger, so to speak.  So what has the system done?  The system has found out a way to be racist and to, and to subjugate as non-white people.  That was 20 white meetings ago.  That is done.  That was.  Should have been there.  And it is done under, under the disguise of racial showcasing. 
[02:16:00]  What is racial showcasing, you ask?  Racial showcasing is simply, a perfect example would be President Obama.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  See.  By the white supremacist.  See, no matter what a black man achieves or a black man doesn't achieve, it's always  the white man's fault.  Stop blaming white people.  Hey, Coop and black people, stop blaming white people.  Stop blaming racism.  Get your shit together. 
[02:16:30]  Get your shit together.  Get your shit together and fucking do something.  By the way, if white supremacists, Coop, if white supremacists, God, I hate, white people  are fucking, white people are fucking everything up.  If white supremacists were going to put a president in that was black, they would not  have put President Obama in.  White supremacists would have put in a conservative guy.  They would not have put in a liberal president.  Right.  It doesn't matter what, because what is politics on?  Sure it does.  That's what you don't understand. 
[02:17:00]  That's what I mean when I say supremacy.  Supremacy means I rule and I say what goes on.  Do you not understand, though?  Obama, Coop, Obama is...  White people...  You were just complaining about...  Oh, let me ask you something.  Obama, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Obama is an elitist.  He's an intellectual elitist.  He's an intellectual elitist.  He's a nerd.  Oh, that's another word of those code words that white people...  Excuse me, I don't mean white people.  Code words.  Code word?  I accuse white people of being intellectually elitist all the time. 
[02:17:30]  Are you saying because he's black he can't be an intellectual elitist?  He's a Harvard elitist guy.  He has an excuse for every black problem, and it's always white people.  No, you have an excuse for every black issue, and it's always white racism.  He's an Ivy League thinking guy.  That's my opinion of Obama.  He's a...  I can't do it.  I know.  Stop talking.  I know.  All right, Coop.  All right, Coop.  You made your point again.  Don't stop talking.  Yeah, Coop.  Let's agree not to disagree.  Let's disagree. 
[02:18:00]  I'm going to the bathroom.  Okay, go peepees.  There's one more thing on the hunting thing, though, Jimmy.  I got a piss.  Uh-uh.  Okay.  Jimmy's a little bladder.  It hurts.  Oh, God.  Yeah, the hunting thing got people worked up, too.  That argument never works with him.  Which one?  Coop.  Because he just, like...  It's always just fucking white people with a big conspiracy.  And I sit around as, you know, a pseudo-white person, because, you know, I am Sicilian. 
[02:18:30]  Part Sicilian, anyway.  But I sit around and have to listen to that shit when my fucking...  My hands and my tongue are tied that I can't honestly speak.  I can speak as honestly as a white person's allowed to speak on the radio.  I think I get away with a lot because I'm not doing it under the guise of hate or anything.  I'm giving my opinion in an open forum.  And I thank God I can do that.  But there are certain things and opinions and even facts that I cannot say. 
[02:19:00]  I will lose my fucking job.  And you're telling me that that isn't power?  Preventing me from exercising my First Amendment right isn't a power that's taken from black people  and put on me as black racism against white people?  You got white people petrified of talking!  You motherfuckers!  You have white people scared shitless to fucking give their opinions! 
[02:19:30]  That's power, motherfucker!  Not me walking around saying,  Oh, this motherfucker or that guy or this...  Oh, fucking not tipping!  Oh, shit, look!  A savage putting a man in a pot in Africa!  Those are jokes!  Those are called fucking jokes!  But you are legitimately keeping me from voicing what my opinions  and other things are for fear of losing my job.  That's more power than I'm fucking wielding. 
[02:20:00]  Jumpy jump, jump, jump, jump.  Yes.  Thank you.  Jumpy jump, jump, jump, jump.  Thank you.  What happened to our fun vibe?  Oh, watching kid shows.  Jumpy jump, jump, jump.  I'm arguing with a fucking gentleman.  Jumpy jump, jump, jump, jump.  Anyone?  Jumpy jump, jump, jump.  Jump, jump, jump.  Jumpy jump, jump, jump, jump.  I want to do the puppet dance.  See, we're happy again.  I want to do the puppet dance.  I figured out how it goes, though.  I don't know.  It's like lift your knee.  Lift your other knee.  Other knee.  Lift your foot.  Lift your other foot. 
[02:20:30]  Spin around in a circle.  Do the puppet dance.  Puppet master.  I can do that part.  You do the other part.  I don't know it.  Raise your knee.  Oh, I got it.  Raise your knee.  Raise your other knee.  Raise your foot.  Raise your other foot.  Walk in a circle.  Do the puppet master.  Now do it double time.  I can't do that double time.  That's crazy.  Why not double time?  Because my throat hurts from yelling at that black gentleman.  Walk in a circle.  Do the puppet master. 
[02:21:00]  That's great, everyone.  Now let's all do it together.  All right, we're going to break this together when I'm happy.  How did he do this?  Raise your knee.  Raise your other knee.  Raise your foot.  Raise your other foot.  Walk in a circle.  Do the puppet master.  Raise your knee.  Raise your other knee.  Raise your foot.  You know what he means about puppet master, too.  Oh, yeah.  Because he's white.  Do the puppet master.  We all know.  Raise your knee.  Raise your other knee.  Raise your foot.  Raise your other foot.  Walk in a circle.  Do the puppet master. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Raise your knee.  Yeah, I hear you.  So RockApe13 writes, sorry us hayseeds don't have Jimmy's approval to do what man has done  for millions of years.  Go to Whole Foods and have some tofu.  Oh, shit.  He got you, Jimmy.  He got you good, Jimmy.  The guy fucking just nailed you.  But that is a typical dummy's response on Twitter.  Like, I didn't say.  I said hunt for food is one thing.  Of course.  You did.  You did say that.  I said what I dislike.  And as far as man doing it for millions of years, go fuck yourself. 
[02:22:00]  Man evolves.  Man didn't have industry X amount of years ago.  Man didn't have a lot of things we have now.  So stop with the man's been doing it for millions of years.  Shit.  I don't want to hear it.  I'm talking about guys that hunt just for sport.  Yeah.  That guys who actually think these delusional motherfuckers.  Yeah.  Who think, I know I'm not good in sports.  So I don't do them.  I was an okay pitcher.  I'm not good enough to play football.  How about this? 
[02:22:30]  You guys that think you're performing in a sport, you're not good enough for sports.  So don't make other shit up like it's a sport so you can tell people you're involved in this.  You're not a sportsman.  Fucking annoys me.  I'm going to go flying today.  Am I a pilot?  No.  I'm a passenger.  That's what bugs me.  It's these guys that think that they're sportsmen and these big game hunter fucking cunts who will show up in a private jet and then murder an elephant and then find an excuse. 
[02:23:00]  Well, the villagers need it.  We all know why you did that, you fucking CEO twat.  So let the villagers.  You think Africans need a fucking multi-millionaire white guy to show up and kill their fucking food for them?  You asshole.  I would respect the CEO if he said, I'm a dick and I'm doing this because I enjoy this.  I'll do this.  If someone wants to bag a deer and take them home and take it to a butcher and have them cut it up and freeze it.  That's different.  That's totally different.  If someone wants to go over to Africa and just blast a rhinoceros in the face, I don't really see a reason for that. 
[02:23:30]  No.  Or guys that do it.  And we know the difference.  You know the difference between guys who are hunting because they like to hunt and they like to eat their own.  They like to fucking cut up and eat what they hunt.  I got no issue with that.  And there is an excitement.  I know that in The Kill.  Sure.  I don't like doing it, but I know the people that hunt.  And if they're hunting for food, there is that stalking. 
[02:24:00]  There is something inherent in humans to hunt.  There is this hunting part of humans.  And that I could see if you're doing it for food.  Sure.  But the ones that are just doing it for sport, let's not act shocked then when somebody fucking shoots up a school.  Hey, he likes to hunt.  And it's really not.  And it's really not.  For the most part, they're on these preserves.  And yeah, they're boxed in.  And it's a farce.  It's not a hunt.  Yeah.  It annoys me so much.  Put yourself in danger. 
[02:24:30]  Walk through a jungle where some animal might come out and fucking kill you.  A snake might bite your fucking ankle and you'll drop dead in the middle of the Serengeti.  And when man was doing it millions of years ago, man was fucking...  There were African tribes.  There's one tribe where they...  Pete Correale does a very funny bit on it.  These guys earn their food.  They run after a deer and they chase the fucking deer until it is tired and can run no more and lays down. 
[02:25:00]  And then they fucking kill it.  To me, that's what a hunt...  You want to hunt and that guy is...  I respect.  Yeah.  If you can follow a deer for 20 miles and then kill it when it gets tired, you're a bad motherfucker.  So enjoy.  I don't care why you did it.  You're not a fan of a guy that sits there with a bag of Doritos and a bright orange outfit in a tree somewhere?  No.  I don't know.  With deer...  This fucking asshole.  They put deer urine on themselves to trick the deer.  You're pissed.  Maybe they just like it. 
[02:25:30]  I hope while they're doing that, somebody is fucking their wife.  Oh, I hope that while they're standing there with their shitty hunting outfits all tucked in, their wife has her legs in the air, and a cock that is not white is finally filling it properly.  How does that feel?  I put deer piss on myself.  Yeah, that's who she wants to fuck.  The guy with deer piss on himself.  I spray a little deer tinkle around the thing.  We didn't...  Good.  Good for you.  I think that's good for you.  You wonder why she's happy when you get home? 
[02:26:00]  It's not because the big man brought home the kill.  It's because she was being fucked properly.  Finally.  Holy fuck.  Finally being fucked properly.  Finally.  Wow.  Finally!  Finally!  While you were spraying deer tinkle and fucking the stuff from deer balls all over your boots.  Yeah, this is a pheromone that attracts the deer.  Really?  So they're rubbing deer balls all over your boots.  Yeah, that's what they do.  They're wearing them around their neck like for earrings.  Yeah, so the deers will show up and they can shoot it. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  And I hope while they're doing that, their wife is coming in some fucking...  In the backseat of somebody else's car.  I hope that she's being fucked so well, she doesn't even care if her husband is shot.  Oh, fuck you.  God damn.  That is fucking...  Sportsman.  The fuck up.  You're not sportsman.  I'm not a sportsman either.  I'm a sportsman.  But I know that.  I know I'm not a sportsman.  I don't pretend I'm a sportsman.  I love UFC.  I love watching those fucking men do what I can't do. 
[02:27:00]  Jimmy, try it.  You'll like it.  No desire.  Try it.  You'll like it.  No desire.  Try it.  You'll like it.  No desire.  Try it.  I don't...  I think this is the one he couldn't find.  What's up?  I can't find it.  It's not there.  Oh, you couldn't find it, Sam?  See, you should try it.  You might like it.  Try it.  You'll like it.  You'll like it.  All right, pause this for a second.  The best part of the song is coming up. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, yeah?  At the end.  At the end.  Because then the little girl tries it.  And guess what?  Tries her father's gun that he left loaded.  She likes it.  Oh, really?  Sure she does.  But her voice will drive you fucking insane.  This is the worst one, by the way.  Let's hear it.  Hit it.  You might like it.  Try it.  You'll like it.  Try it.  You'll like it.  Try it.  You'll like it. 
[02:28:00]  Try it.  You're gonna like it.  I know it's new.  Is that from Merman?  You've never tasted it.  You'll just have to trust in me.  Oh, boy.  Just give it a try.  Yeah!  Try it.  You'll like it.  Try it.  You'll like it.  Try it.  You'll like it.  Try it. 
[02:28:30]  You're gonna like it.  I'll lick my sweaty balls.  Try it.  You'll like it.  Try it.  You'll like it.  Stop talking and start sucking.  You'll like it.  Now lick my sweaty balls.  Try it.  Now lick my sweaty balls.  Now lick my sweaty balls.  I know it's new.  I know it's new.  I'm gonna come down your throat.  And you've never tasted it.  You'll just have to trust in me.  I'm gonna fuck you in a month.  Give it a try.  Hey, what about the cheeks of my ass? 
[02:29:00]  I like it.  I like it.  Oh.  I tried it.  And now I like it.  Oh, that's Laura Bell.  I like it.  Laura Bell.  Roll over and shut up.  I tried it.  Roll over and shut up.  I like it.  Stop talking and start sucking.  I like it.  Stop talking and start sucking.  And now I like it.  Yes.  I'm gonna fuck you in a month.  You will be molested.  I tried it.  And now I like it.  I'm coming, you dumb bitch.  I told you if you tried it. 
[02:29:30]  I told you if you tried it.  You didn't like it.  Yes, now you have to go and pick blueberries.  Oh, God.  There's a little look in my head.  I'll lick my sweaty ball.  All right.  Hey.  So great.  And before Captain America comes in.  Yes.  And if he's not in full uniform, we turn him away by the way, Sam.  Make sure Roland knows that.  Yes.  I don't think he's gonna be.  If he walks through that door as a civilian, we are not interested.  I haven't changed.  We want to feel like children today.  I don't think he's gonna be.  I want to feel like I'm meeting a true superhero today. 
[02:30:00]  He doesn't have to have the shield.  No, he has to have everything.  Oh, shit.  Everything.  Tell Roland.  Ask Roland during the break.  Oh, God.  I love him.  And then when we get back, because we've gone way too long, we've only, this is only  our second break coming out.  Oh, I know.  It's insanity.  You saw the video of the guy shooting himself, right?  Oh, fantastic.  So I want to ask you what he did wrong and all that.  The video itself is funny.  Oh, yeah.  But then get your expertise on the whole thing.  What a dolt.  And then a guy is called Cunt on TV or something, because his last name is Hunt or something. 
[02:30:30]  I don't know.  Mike?  Yeah, we'll have that after the break as well.  Hey, we're going to talk to Captain America in a few minutes.  By the way, I want to give props to Robert Kelly, Jim Norton.  I think Anthony was in on it.  And I'm very suspicious of Club Soda Kenny as well. 
[02:31:00]  Oh.  I got the shit scared out of me yesterday after the show.  Robert Kelly filmed it on his iPhone.  I didn't know it was going down.  I just saw...  But I watched the video a few times, and you're just sitting in wait.  No, I was sitting...  Because you knew something was about to happen.  I saw Bobby come out with his camera, but I didn't know what he was going to do.  And then when I saw him start running up to you, then I knew and figured I'd, you know,  take a look.  But I had no idea.  I was scared and relieved at the same time, if that's possible.  And that reaction is on film of me, like, going from... 
[02:31:30]  And, oh...  At the same time.  Yep.  And Bobby, thank you, Bobby.  He gave it to me to put on my stupid YouTube channel.  He could have put it on his...  If you go to my Twitter, Opie Radio, I think it's one of my last tweets, if you want to  check out the video for yourself.  We've got to stop talking about that, because we have Captain America coming into the studio.  Chris Evans, how are you, sir?  What's up, Chris?  Thanks for coming in and saying hi to us.  No sweat.  No sweat.  Make yourself as comfy as you can.  I believe...  Yeah, I had fun. 
[02:32:00]  Huh?  Look at this idiot.  Yeah, another guy that almost flopped over the railing.  I think his friends had him pretty good, though.  In the wake of what's happening, come on.  Yeah, yeah.  Too risky.  You know he had a few.  Maybe take a week or so before you start diving over the rail again.  I was talking to Anthony about this before the show.  Guaranteed, by next year, they're going to raise all those...  What would you call them?  The guardrails, I guess.  The rails, or they'll put netting there.  To keep all the fans safe.  Because that's what happened in hockey.  I'm a big hockey fan. 
[02:32:30]  And the pucks would always go into the stands.  And it drilled a girl, unfortunately, and she died.  And the next thing you know, they put nets up in every arena.  A lot harder to see a puck flying at you than a baseball.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure it hurts a lot more.  Oh, man.  I don't know why they can't figure out that puck thing in hockey.  That it has to still be a black puck.  Yeah.  Which is so hard to see.  But you know what?  Didn't they do that one SportsCenter thing where they would like...  With the trail?  That'll trail.  Oh, the trail.  It's like a video game.  Yeah.  That looked silly.  It was like a neon pink thing shooting around a team.  It looked like Tron or something. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  That did look silly.  I don't know how they make it better.  I guess they've tried it over and over again.  They just can't figure it out.  But you're not here to talk about that.  No.  Oh, my God.  Chris is Captain America.  That's some roll to get, man.  Yeah.  That's right.  How did you spin that one?  That's pretty cool.  You've got to pay a lot of people.  Yeah.  Is that it?  No.  Just luck, man.  Got a little luck in there.  That's all.  Did you get the call or did you go on an audition?  No.  Initially, I got the call to audition. 
[02:33:30]  And I was like, oh, great.  That's exciting.  I can't wait to do that.  And then I kind of digested and thought about it.  And I said, wait a minute.  Initially, it was a nine-picture thing.  Wow.  Nine movies.  Damn.  Nine movies?  Nine movies.  Are you Harry Potter?  No kidding.  This is like, and you know, that's in my head.  I could be doing this until I'm 40.  That's crazy.  They're going to run out of themes.  You know, number six, Captain America saves Wall Street.  Damn.  So that scared you a little bit.  You don't want to be tied up to. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  You can't make too long for the next 10 years of your life on a whim.  And I just was like, I just don't know if that's what I'm looking for.  So I said, no, thanks.  And then it was really like, it's like a girl.  You know, the more you say no, I was like, no, I'm good.  And they called back.  They were like, well, we really have interest.  And I was like, no, I'm really good.  And then just kind of, they kept coming back.  Wow.  Like, tweaking the deal.  And then eventually I was like, okay.  You know what I love about this story?  The confidence that you must have to go, nah, I'm good.  I don't need to be Captain America.  Any other actor would go, fuck yeah. 
[02:34:30]  I'll be honest.  I mean, I'm not that.  Come on.  Let's be real.  If I hadn't done it and I was seeing all the, can we swear on this show?  Yeah, yeah.  Matter of fact, yeah.  If I was seeing all the shit that I'm seeing now and it wasn't me, I'd be kicking myself.  Yeah.  I would have been an idiot.  It would have been a moronic move.  And I'm glad I did.  Absolutely, man.  I was just scared.  What can you tell us about Captain America?  Is it going to be dark, cartoony?  Like, where are we at?  It's not dark.  I kind of asked the same thing when I took my meetings with him.  I was like, well, what's the tone?  You know what I mean?  Right.  We did Fantastic Four.  Yeah. 
[02:35:00]  And, you know, I like Spider-Man, but it's very glossy and colorful.  And I just wanted to know, where is this going to fall on the spectrum of things?  We're not going like Dark Knight X-Men.  And they said, well, what do you think about Iron Man?  And I said, I loved it.  They said, we're going to try and live in that world, that tone.  So, I mean, it's got a, you know, it's a period movie.  So, yeah.  Just being in the 40s has a nice, like, grain to it.  That's the cool thing, too.  It brings it a little more in a real place.  And people love fighting like Nazis.  Yeah.  Yeah.  People just love any, whether it's a video game or movies. 
[02:35:30]  It's like, yeah.  Those Nazis, they were all right.  It's like.  Just understood.  I think we know who the bad guys are in this one.  Yeah.  Take a look at his mustache.  Oh, no.  It used to be a lot longer there, Chris.  No, it was not.  I'm not trimming it.  It's shorter by the month at this point.  I'm not trimming it down.  Why do you think the 40s they chose?  Because the Nazis are, do you think it's because in this day and age, when you choose movie  villains, there's too many, the one group you can kind of choose as villains are Nazis.  We can all agree on it. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  I think Nazis are just a communal, I mean, it's just, there's no, it's undeniable evil.  I think they took the 40s because that's when Captain America was created.  Yeah.  That's when they saw.  And is that a picture of Hugo Weaving?  Yeah.  Right there?  No, that's me.  I haven't been through makeup here.  Yeah.  Oh, that's.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  That is a bad, bad morning.  Rough mornings.  Tequila will do to you.  Hugo's been in some huge movies.  That's what I was just saying to my buddy, the guy just can't stop making unbelievable  franchises.  And it's like, I was watching, I think about the same time, you had the Matrix trilogy. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  And then Lord of the Rings.  Oh, I guess I do Lord of the Rings too.  It's like, bah, let me do this.  Let me just dominate film.  Give me three epic trilogies.  Bah.  And then when I have some time, I'll drop in on this movie or so.  But how is he?  He's a pretty good actor.  He's great.  Yeah.  He's great.  And he's terrifying.  Playing the bad guy.  He really is spooky.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he's got that great Nazi jacket look there.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:37:00]  Red skull.  Bad guys, but great jackets.  Great makeup.  I gotta say.  Snappy dressers.  Your uniform, now, is, what I like about it, it's not that glossy kind of like a spandexy  thing.  It's almost like an army guy would wear back in the time.  Well, that was the goal.  You know, they wanted to make it utilitarian.  It has function.  Right, right.  It looks like this actually might be, maybe not the color scheme, but you might actually  wear this. 
[02:37:30]  Might stand out.  In battle, yeah.  It's kind of like a bullseye.  But it certainly looks like it actually might serve a purpose in war.  Yeah.  You have like an almost parachute harness type thing, and the material looks very rugged  and not slick.  Do you know, I was caught stealing a Captain America comic book when I was younger.  My friend Marvin and I went to steal, oh no, it was Paul.  My friend Paul and I went to steal comic books.  Typical Paul.  Yes.  And one of the ones I got caught ripping off was a Captain America 100.  It was like a big issue.  Yeah.  It was like X-Men 94. 
[02:38:00]  There's a few weird, I'm not a big comic book freak.  I used to like them, and then I sold them to drink and get drugs.  You know how it is when you're a youngster.  And that was one of the ones I got caught ripping off.  But I never knew much about Captain America.  I didn't, I think the ones I liked were like the Hulk and a few other ones.  I liked the fact that it was, you know, back in that era.  Worked out really well.  The, a lot of CGI, obviously.  Yeah, decent amount.  You know, the whole first half of the movie I'm playing this little, you know, he's a  weenie. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And so, so those days were tricky, because they, they, they did some amazing stuff.  They actually shrunk me down.  And so, that's how well built he is.  They had to CGI him to look shitty.  It's, I don't know how they do it.  It's, because I mean, if, if, if you're filming somebody and you shrink them down, as you shrink  them down, you know, background will appear as the body condenses.  So, we had to do, you know, five, six takes every time to, you know, one with me in a  green screen, one without me in a green screen, one with just the background. 
[02:39:00]  I mean, it was, scenes where we were doing the skinny stuff were incredibly tedious, but,  but it looks good.  It really does.  That is, it is amazing.  Yeah.  Uh, is this the first, uh, this isn't the first film you've done in front of a green  screen, swinging from harnesses and.  Yeah, yeah.  We did a lot of that stuff for Fantastic Four.  Yeah, Fantastic Four, yeah.  You know, he's flying around, so I'm living in a harness for you.  Yeah.  There were, there was a lot of green screening in, uh, Not Another Teen Movie, too.  I love that movie, by the way. 
[02:39:30]  And I just want to acknowledge that Chris Evans was in that film.  Critically acclaimed.  And I'm usually not into those type of films, but something about Another Teen Movie makes  me howl.  And I just want to acknowledge that, too, sir.  Oh, I didn't, I'm so stupid.  I met all you guys at the Fantastic Four.  I got a picture with the whole group.  I should have gotten a sign.  Fuck, am I dumb?  Oh, good to bet.  I didn't think today.  Well, Jimmy never thinks of having people sign pictures.  I got chick lists.  I should have gotten them, too.  I'm so silly.  Man.  That's all I do is get things signed.  That's all he does.  You, uh, you did Letterman? 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, we did the top ten.  And that was right, uh, right after that maniac was in the lobby, kind of.  Was there a maniac in the lobby?  Showing things up.  Yeah.  I didn't know about this.  Wow, yeah.  I thought Dave would have talked about it or something.  What happened?  Or maybe not talk about it.  Why?  Some guy got arrested for trashing the, he was an out-of-work actor in his early 20s,  and he broke all the windows of the Ed Sullivan Theater, the glass doors, and he trashed  the lobby, the video.  And these doors, right?  They got it on video?  You knew that.  It was on, no.  He knew that, you idiots.  Well, no, I swear, I really actually didn't. 
[02:40:30]  No, all right, then I'll be in it.  It was in my, I did the top ten list, and one of the top ten lists was about someone  breaking into the theater.  And they gave me a brief, they were like, it's, someone did a, anyway, so this is what  you can, you know, I was like, I don't know what I'm wrong with you.  So apparently, they got it on video?  Yeah, I think there's a lobby video.  I didn't watch it.  Security things.  But yeah, there's some kind of security, and there's nothing that isn't caught on camera  now.  Letterman had a great time with him yesterday.  Oh, I hope so, yeah.  He had a lot of fun with this.  This guy helped his acting career.  Oh, I get it. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, that's the kid being let out of, uh.  Now you gotta deal with commercials.  Oh, God, I hate the police station on the internet.  Oh, why should you be doing that now?  God.  You know, it is a trade-off, though, because the videos are better, and you don't have to  wait for that scrolling picture.  Wait till those commercials become 60 seconds every time, two minutes, bunching a bunch  of commercials together.  Those are classic doors.  Like, those are the original doors of the theater.  What a dick this guy is.  Wow.  You really put it out there, Jim.  Yeah, I take risks. 
[02:41:30]  What a dick this guy is.  Why would you trash such a historic place?  Yeah, he was angry.  Well, he's got issues.  And he said he doesn't even remember it, because he was that hammered.  Eh, what are you gonna do?  That's why I'm glad I quit drinking, because those are the things.  He probably doesn't remember it, and he'll wake up and go, I did what?  Like, that's what I do.  To who?  Of all the shows, you don't want to trash.  Especially if you're an actor.  Yeah.  He's trying to make it.  You might need that, stupid.  Yeah.  It's the place you want to end up.  How long were you working before you got your first real gig, or how long were you 
[02:42:00]  auditioning before you landed something that you considered good?  Not long, man.  I got real lucky.  I got real lucky.  Yeah.  I lived here, actually, for about six months, doing an internship at a casting office, just  meeting people, and trying to kiss ass, basically.  Pretty good.  Yeah, and then I got an agent, and it was okay.  It only a few months, and I got a TV show on it.  Wow, man.  What was the show?  It was a show for Fox called Opposite Sex.  We ran, like, eight episodes, and that was it.  It was garbage.  Was it a bad show? 
[02:42:30]  I liked it.  But, you know.  Yeah, I mean, I was 18.  I was ecstatic.  I was like, this should be winning Emmys.  Would you look back on it?  Is it not as good now as you thought it was then?  Oh, nothing is.  Trust me.  I look back at the old plays I used to do when I thought it was, like, fucking Broadway caliber.  Yeah.  I look at these shows, and I cannot, I just want to apologize to my father for making  him sit through countless plays, when all he wants to be is at, like, a lacrosse field,  and I'm like, come see me in tights in Shakespeare. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, shit.  You know, this poor guy just sat through it.  But I watched some of these plays recently back then.  That is the old show.  Oh, look at the old cast.  Who was in that?  Anybody?  It was Milo.  Milo Ventimiglia, that, you know, dude from Heroes, and he's been in a bunch of stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, Kyle Howard.  Yeah, the guy on the far left.  Can't stop working.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What was it about?  It was about an all-girls school that opened their doors, co-ed, and only three guys applied.  I remember that.  Yeah.  I remember that. 
[02:43:30]  Well, that's too bad.  I never said I watched it, just remembered it.  So it didn't do well?  No, no.  That happens.  I mean, you know.  No, I mean, but after a couple of months to land a TV gig like that, that's pretty  Yeah, it was lucky.  Goddamn.  At least that made it eight episodes.  Paul Reiser, the second, two episodes of the Yankham.  How humiliating.  Yeah.  You can't even get a good rhythm going.  No, no.  But he had a big show, Man About You.  It was a fucking huge show.  Yeah.  And then he has Larry David on his first show, and he's still two episodes and done. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  He knew it, though.  He came in here.  He just knew it.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He knew.  You've never seen anybody sell anything as poorly as he sold the show.  You just sold your old show better than he sold the one.  Way better, Chris.  That was coming out.  He knew it was something.  Paul was in here, and he just knew.  That's hilarious.  Just one of those things again.  Who's the, in Captain America, who's the, any love interest?  Oh, yeah.  This girl, Hayley Atwell.  Hayley Atwell.  She's British. 
[02:44:30]  You might not know her yet.  You will.  Punch that up there, Sam.  I need a picture.  Let's get to know her right now.  I need a picture.  Let's get to know her.  Have you done a lot of make-out scenes?  I've done one in a minute.  Make-out scenes.  How old are you?  All right.  That is true.  I really am 42 using 13-year-old boy fucking doctor.  Have you done a lot of kissing scenes?  Yeah, yeah, I have.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, this girl.  Okay.  Yeah, she's a cutie, man.  Oh, yeah, she is.  She's a cutie.  There you go.  Real sharp.  Like, if she was here, she'd be slinging them right with you guys.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  That's all well and good, but how's her ass? 
[02:45:00]  Oh, she's great.  Wow, she's a...  Yeah, just look at some of these pictures.  You'll see what we're dealing with.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, hell yeah.  That's a great picture right there.  What does she look like?  She looks like Megan Fox a little bit.  Oh, you think?  A little bit?  Yeah.  I thought she looked like Natty Gann.  I don't know.  Wow, that's a great picture.  She looks like a slightly older Selena Gomez in that picture.  Yeah, that's...  Nothing wrong with Selena Gomez.  Every woman that has ever rejected me.  That's a lot.  So, yeah. 
[02:45:30]  So, good for you.  She's the...  You know, you gotta make sure she's okay.  Yeah, exactly.  You take care of her.  She's the one I'm looking after.  Yeah.  At least you got her.  Poor Chris Reeve had to get Margo Kidder.  That is a psychopath.  That lunatic.  Who cast that movie?  Running naked in her shrubs.  Yeah, man.  What a lunatic.  Why are you putting soup by me?  It's mine.  That's mine.  Away from me.  Oh, I'll have it later.  I don't know.  Our soup arrived as we're talking to Captain America.  I know.  Talking to Captain America.  We're down in front of the wrong people.  Our stupid soupy. 
[02:46:00]  I don't want that.  We need soup in the morning, Chris.  No, you don't.  Oh, okay.  Why are you interrupting our Captain America interview?  I wasn't trying to.  Exactly.  Do you have a question?  No.  Why not?  Why not?  He's really into the geek stuff.  Later on, Eric.  But this is more than a geek world thing we're talking about, obviously.  You're going to come in and bring soup in.  You obviously want him to notice you.  Well, don't embarrass me.  And I'll be like, in episode three.  What do you got?  In episode five.  Eric, one question for Captain America.  Anything?  Anything?  Come on.  Yeah, you wanted Captain America to notice you.  Now Chris is here.  So talk to him. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, come on, man.  Don't be shy.  One question.  One question.  Come on, Eric.  Ask him.  Why are you turning red?  You look like Red Skull.  You look like Red Skull, and I'm bringing turkey chili and soups up.  Oh, wow.  Why are you turning red?  Ask him.  I wasn't expecting to talk to Mr. Evans.  I know.  Oh, Mr. Evans.  Mr. Evans.  What are you, the principal?  You guys are almost like twins.  Sorry.  Don't assault him like that.  So you're playing Captain America. 
[02:47:00]  Excellent question.  Always lead off of the fact.  So, you are human.  You walked in under your own power.  Good job.  Good.  Good so far.  So, you're obviously going to be tied into the Avengers movie that comes out in 2012.  Have you heard anything more?  Everybody's looking forward to that movie, but have you heard anything past that?  Like, are there going to be sequels to the Avengers series?  That's cool.  Well, I mean, I'd like to believe the Avengers is going to do well. 
[02:47:30]  I don't know.  But, I mean, from what I've seen and what we're shooting, it looks like it's going to be good.  The real question is, will there be a sequel to Captain America?  If there's not a sequel to Captain America, they might dump me.  You know what I mean?  Oh, man.  The concern is, if the movie doesn't do well, and it's your fault, and everyone else is doing their job, Thor was great.  I'm sure the Avengers would be good.  They obviously don't mind replacing people.  I mean, they swapped Ed Norton out for Ruffalo, and they're redoing the Spider-Man movie.  In comic book movies, they will replace you.  Marvel's not scared.  Marvel is not scared. 
[02:48:00]  So, the first hurdle I've got to get over is if Captain America does well.  If Captain America does well, I'm sure there's no doubt there'll be sequels along with Avengers.  Eric doesn't know what a hurdle is, so it's like an obstruction.  Something to jump over, which I can't do.  I'm trying to say that subtly, but sure.  Oh, E-Rock, you're just a little chubby.  E-Rock has a follow-up question.  That was my...  What would your follow-up question be?  That was a good question, actually.  I know you're trying to be polite, but...  That's your follow-up.  I just hope this works good.  I hate this much, Sam. 
[02:48:30]  If not, you know, it was nice seeing you as Captain America.  Great reading.  Oh, man.  What is...  He's a big...  That's nice.  I got stuff.  It's good.  We don't have anything to do.  When did Eric see him as Captain America?  The movie doesn't come out until the 22nd.  I saw the trailer.  The trailer looks fantastic.  Yeah.  The trailer looks great, man.  Are you comfortable watching yourself on film?  I mean, if I looked like you, I'd probably be more comfortable watching myself.  But I don't...  I hate watching stuff that I do.  I'm okay doing it if I'm alone.  If I'm, like, in my own...  Right.  If it's a private screening or whatever, I can't do it with an audience of people.  You get embarrassed?  I just get in there. 
[02:49:00]  I don't know what it is.  I just got to get out of there.  Really?  Yeah.  Have you seen any screenings yet?  Of Captain America?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you in the back?  Well, I've seen it alone in the theater.  Oh, that's right.  I can handle that.  I'm not going to sit through at the premiere.  No way.  No, huh?  Oh, well.  I'll be in a pool of sweat.  You know, like, if a laugh is supposed to come or a moment and if the reaction doesn't  come, it's like, oh.  That's going to be a horrible feeling.  So what?  You'll go to the premiere and then kind of make believe you're going in the movie and  then hit the side door?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Just start boozing.  Get out.  A couple of, yeah. 
[02:49:30]  A couple of pops.  Have you had any moments like that where you're watching yourself?  I did an independent movie one time.  It was a fucking bad movie.  And I had to go to the premiere.  I was Florentine's in it.  And it was so humiliating watching it bomb.  I mean, it was right that it bombed.  It made me respect the audience because it was horrible.  But it's like I left halfway through and I'm like, I can't watch.  This is a terrible movie.  Yeah, I did a movie once.  It was at the Tribeca, or it was at the Tribeca, Toronto Film Festival.  And I'd already seen the film and I was fine with the film.  For whatever reason, the movie started and I'm in a row, like, smack dab in the middle 
[02:50:00]  of the theater.  There's like, you know, 20 people.  No way to say it.  Can't leave.  Oh, I left.  It just wasn't pretty.  Ten minutes in, started to sweat.  Fifteen minutes in, started to, like, just, you know, get back really like, okay, I think  I can smell myself right now.  That's it.  I gotta go.  I gotta go.  Did they know you were there?  Oh, everybody.  The whole row was the whole cast.  And, you know, I just did this.  Sorry.  Sorry.  I'm stepping over like old people.  Pod me.  Pod me.  Excuse me.  Pod me.  Right back up. 
[02:50:30]  I just gotta go to the bathroom.  And that, you know, ten minutes in, I didn't come back.  Gotta go to the bathroom.  At my house.  My bathroom.  Was it a comedy or a drama?  Drama.  What was wrong with it?  Did you know that the audience was not buying into it?  What was happening?  Wasn't there anything wrong with it?  I just, I don't know.  It's a period movie.  It was like, you know, it took place in like the 1920s.  And it was a Tennessee Williams piece.  So it's got a, it's got a very moderate pace to it.  Right, right, right.  Yeah.  I gotta get that.  A thinking man's movie. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  Do we know the movie?  It was called Lost of a Teardrop Diamond.  It's actually a good movie.  I just couldn't sit through it with an audience.  I just couldn't sit through it.  I had to go get a beer.  Are you good at Shakespeare?  Huh?  Are you good at doing Shakespeare?  I grew up doing a lot of Shakespeare plays.  I have never done it on film.  You need an accent to sound.  I mean, when an American guy starts rattling off Shakespeare, you're like, shut up.  But every single break can just, you know, crap it out.  And I'm like, brilliant.  Brilliant.  I wonder why that is.  Like when you watch Olivier or Gilgud, I've watched them on YouTube doing Shakespeare. 
[02:51:30]  It really is.  But then I watched Brando doing it and I preferred him doing it.  It was like, that's the way.  Like he really, I've said this before, but it was like, well, I've never seen Shakespeare  like acted by somebody who seemed to feel it when they did it.  But it's like, oh, he understands what Mark Anthony is really saying there.  Did the people that understand Shakespeare like his version?  Oh, they had to have.  Spartacus, I think he was playing.  Or whatever it was.  But Spartacus wasn't Shakespeare.  I'm an idiot.  Fucking Ben-Hur.  I really am dumb.  Spartacus. 
[02:52:00]  Spartacus.  We got to respect Chris Evans' time.  We try to keep you guys later than.  But he's got a wrap.  You really got a lot going on.  You must be running around like a maniac, man.  This shit's fun, though.  Oh, thank you.  That's cool.  Hey, thanks for coming by.  Thanks for having me, man.  And believe me, best of luck with the movie.  Thanks so much.  Captain America opening July 22nd.  And I'm sure they'll keep you at least one.  I hope so.  At least one more.  I would like to offer my services, by the way.  If it doesn't work out. 
[02:52:30]  In the sequel, if they need somebody, like say you have to go through some sort of an accident  and you have to morph into a lumpy individual, green screening, I'd be happy to offer my  torso and neck and face.  I know a guy.  And I wouldn't mind another teen movie myself.  I'll try and get that going.  Get it all going.  He's taking requests.  Yeah.  Captain America, The First Avenger, in theaters July 22nd.  We're all looking forward to that.  Quick break and then we'll wrap up the show.  Stay there.  Kind of bummed Chris Evans, Captain America, had a fun time with him. 
[02:53:00]  And then mics go off and he goes, I just want to tell you guys, I used to listen to you guys  when you were in Boston.  He fucking knows us from our AF days.  I would have loved to have gotten into that with him.  He's a nice dude.  Real nice guy.  I didn't realize he was the torch.  I know I'm thinking about my stupid picture I could have got signed, but I just didn't 
[02:53:30]  know that was him.  Yeah.  You know how good looking you have to be to play two different superheroes?  God, that depresses me.  I fucking hate myself because I ate two munchkins.  Now I'm eating crackers.  Fat pig, selfish fool.  Hey, you're eating my crackers, I think.  And I need my crackers.  Ooh.  Here you go.  One more.  No, I was kidding.  No, I don't want them because I'll eat them.  What's up with the roll of crackers?  They're the carbs.  Yeah, but that's okay.  And it's white wheat. 
[02:54:00]  I'm the two cracker kid.  Better than the munchkins and all the donuts they just brought by.  Did you make it through the donuts without grabbing one?  I didn't grab one, but boy, you should have just seen Roland.  When I came down the hallway, he was peeking in that box with wide eyes, like a kid looking  down the stairs on Christmas morning.  Dude, I almost set up Roland so bad yesterday.  I'm in the park with my son.  It's my thing now.  I'm going to hang out with the moms.  It's me and the moms.  The moms. 
[02:54:30]  And they give me some attention.  Oh, yeah?  They would all fuck your brains out.  They give me a little attention.  And Roland was in the neighborhood.  I go, hey, come by the park.  When you come by, we'll go and do our shit, which is just nonsense, right?  And then I learned yesterday that you are not allowed to go in a park if you don't have  a kid.  I learned two new words.  Stranger danger.  Stranger danger.  There's something called stranger danger.  What parks?  Like every city park.  You can't go in if you don't walk in with a kid. 
[02:55:00]  With a playground.  And we learned that yesterday because I'm in the back of the park, sort of, to the back  part of it, whatever.  Yeah.  Roland walks in and a woman jumped on her fucking cell phone immediately.  They don't fuck around.  Wait a minute.  You can't go into, no, no, no.  Like Central Park?  No, no.  Like a playground.  Oh, the playground.  Playground.  A playground.  A playground, yeah.  That's different.  That's what I mean by a park.  I'm sorry.  I should have said like a playground.  Playground.  I should have said playground.  Well, they're parks to us, whatever.  That makes sense.  But he walked in and a woman jumped on her phone. 
[02:55:30]  What do you mean it makes sense?  Yeah.  You know what?  They start calling people and you're like, I used to teach here.  They mind everybody's bees.  What are we in Nazi Germany?  Nazi.  But if you don't think the moms are paying attention, he walked through the front gate  of this dumb park we were at or a playground.  And all eyes went up.  Maybe exaggerating a little bit, but enough eyes went up and a woman grabbed their phone.  And you see the kids, come here, come here, come here, come here. 
[02:56:00]  Well, Roland looks like a pedophile anyway.  Yeah, yeah.  He kind of looked like a molester.  I was sweaty and had water like, hell.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So wait, did you have any donuts?  Because it looks like there's a little frosting right here.  No, I had no donuts.  Didn't you?  Good.  Not yet.  No, I had no donuts.  I had two munchkins.  Are you breaking down?  No, I just smelled them like crack them.  Yeah, you really were smiling.  He was smiling looking at me.  I just had to smell it.  I had two munchkins and I regret it because they've been in the box show office. 
[02:56:30]  They're sweaty.  There's nothing worse than a sweaty donut bottom.  But it smells so good, though.  They should buy that cologne.  Why can't you just smell something and that satisfies you?  You know what I mean?  Why you got to put it in your face and fucking swallow it?  Right, right, right, right.  Yeah.  That's like a pussy.  You can't sit there and just smell a pussy, can you?  That's true.  I got to give you that.  You can't just take a pussy and wave it under your nose.  You want to put your mouth on it.  Sure.  Yeah.  So I almost set up rolling. 
[02:57:00]  All I had to say was, he's not with me.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know who this is.  Get away from my kid.  Like, I hope he.  My name's Greg.  Right.  Get this man out of here.  I'm a man like you.  My name's Greg.  And then the other thing, good old Sam, not Sam on Twitter, tweets a picture of the  free fucking Slurpee.  7-Eleven should be embarrassed.  They should be embarrassed.  You know, yesterday was 7-Eleven day, because it was 7-Eleven, July 11th.  Yeah.  So you go to 7-Eleven, you get a free Slurpee, which sounds like a great fucking thing to 
[02:57:30]  do.  It certainly does.  You got to wait online, and Sam tweeted the picture of the actual Slurpee they give  out for free.  Why bother at that point?  How long was the line?  It was like 10 people deep.  10 people deep.  How much is a Slurpee?  $2.  You give away free shit or free ice cream, and these dummies.  Yeah.  And it's not just people who are really poor or homeless people.  Guys with a briefcase.  Yeah.  It's like, what are you doing, asshole?  You make 80 grand a year.  Buy a Slurpee.  I'd wait online maybe for a free Slurpee, but not if it's that size. 
[02:58:00]  What was the demo of the line?  Well, there were students, probably.  There were a bunch of students.  Because I went on like 4 o'clock.  Yeah.  So it was like right at school, I was getting out.  A bunch of like students.  But then their parents went, too.  And their parents were filling up their little cups, too.  God, that's ridiculous.  I'm looking at the picture.  How big is that Slurpee?  Because I know you have giant hands, so I'm a little confused.  I don't have that big hands.  It's a Dixie cup, practically.  You do have big hands.  Ew.  Your hand bends in like fucking five joints.  I have a big thumb. 
[02:58:30]  That's probably like an eight ounce.  Yeah.  You have monkey hands.  I don't know.  I like your thumb chimp hands.  Opposable thumbs.  You have a normal pinky?  Yeah, it's normal.  Oh, God.  I dream for a normal pinky.  Look at this.  Look at this.  Come here.  Sam has long monkey fingers.  He does.  Beat it, rhesus monkey hands.  Yeah.  God said my hand was good enough and gave me like a half pinky.  What's wrong with your pinky?  Go put up your other hand.  You want to see what's wrong with my pinky?  Oh, look at the size of his hands.  That's what's wrong with my pinky.  Well, your whole hand is tiny. 
[02:59:00]  You look like a fucking couple.  You look like it was like a guy and girl wedding photo.  Let me see.  I have small hands, too.  My fucking thumb was chopped off and my pinky, they decided to give me like an infant's pinky.  What happened there?  I guess.  I'm in the womb.  I guess God was too busy making my face so beautiful that he fucked up my hands.  He fucked your hands up?  You're not as good looking as the thing in the radio.  I just want to make that point today.  Fuck you. 
[02:59:30]  All the kids were going back for like 10 of them.  Oh, really?  They just kept, you know, they'd go outside, they'd drink it, then they'd come back in and  fill it back up.  Oh, those kids.  So after the 10th time, they finally got a normal Slurpee in their little bellies.  Hard to get brain freeze, though, right?  Dare I say yummy in my tummy.  I was just trying to go, get a Slurpee, head home.  It was nothing, though.  Was Mars and his family there?  Oh, Roland.  What if you went to take two cups out? 
[03:00:00]  No, no, no.  All you need is a girl?  Oh, two girls.  Ah, well.  I know what you meant, but they were handing the cups out.  And then what if you said, give me another one?  They'd be like, no, it's one cup per person.  And what?  You go to the machine?  So why don't you fucking slam one down?  Yeah, yeah.  What if you just stand by the machine and just fucking drinking it?  It's impossible to get a fucking brain freeze.  It's so tight.  Yeah.  But I didn't want to hold up the line chugging Slurpees at the machine. 
[03:00:30]  I know.  One minute.  One minute.  And you're just there.  Slurpee shots.  It's brilliant on 7-Eleven's part, because the fact is, they sell more Slurpees on free  7-Eleven Slurpee day than any other day.  Because you get a little bit, and you go like, I want a lot of bit.  It's kind of smart marketing.  Yeah, I'd love a full-size Slurpee after having that taste.  I wonder where I could get one.  Oh, right here.  Here.  Sam, why don't we take this concept and give the people just a tiny bit of our show? 
[03:01:00]  Ah.  And then they walk away with a lot of the show.  And they want more, like, next week.  Like, we'll say...  So every other week, we only give them one day.  And we'll say, we'll give you a segment from the show, but then the segment cuts off before  it's over.  No, I want some way we can go home.  Oh, you just want to do less show.  I didn't realize that was...  That's what I meant.  That's our goal.  I didn't realize that was the strategy.  Less Slurpee, less show.  Oh.  Then they want more show, want more Slurpee. 
[03:01:30]  But you're at home.  Yeah, but I'll do it, like, next week.  Oh, okay.  You'll make up for it.  I'll come in and give them the full Slurpee next week.  And then the next week?  Small Slurpee.  Small Slurpee.  Like, every other week, you do one show per week.  Right.  And this is how we create demand for the following week.  Yes.  That's right.  Ah, that's my gig.  Relax, people.  He's creating demand now.  Yes.  Oh, he sure is.  He sure is, Sam.  Demand for our show, apparently.  Thank you.  Thank you, everybody. 
[03:02:00]  Are there more people listening to our show?  Oh, yeah.  It is.  Yeah.  It's nice.  It's tough for them to admit it, but we're saying, welcome.  Welcome.  Welcome.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Welcome.  Welcome.  And people get confused.  I don't have a problem with Howard's schedule.  God bless him for getting it.  I wish I had it.  I don't have a problem with the company for fucking being so stupid.  God damn.  Just giving things away like that, you mean?  Yeah.  Giving away everyone's raises.  Yes, Sam.  Oh.  I was thinking of for you idiots that haven't had a raise in years.  His work calendar looks like it has the measles. 
[03:02:30]  That's a red dot.  Yeah.  See?  It's like it's got the mumps or something.  No, that would be two mumps.  No.  That doesn't make any sense.  So many reds.  It's like, what are you playing?  Bingo over there?  B-I-N-G-O is his name-o?  Who wants to guess the size of the free Slurpee?  I know what it is, so I have to place myself.  You can't play.  I'm out of the competition.  Roland said eight ounces.  I'm saying six ounce.  I said ten.  You said ten, Jim.  Roland said eight.  Six ounce.  Ant said six.  Obi, obviously you know. 
[03:03:00]  Well, I do know, Sam.  Okay.  I said you did.  How big?  Because they're so hacky, I knew they would do this.  Oh, no.  Seven ounce Slurpee.  No.  7.11 ounces for the free Slurps.  Yeah.  7.11 ounces.  Why?  That's good.  7.11.  I'm kidding.  Stupid asshole.  Stupid asshole.  All literal Sam.  You guys want to hear this day in ONA history?  What happened?  And are we doing line of the day or did we forget? 
[03:03:30]  Wow.  Yes, we are.  Or do you do it on your show?  I'll do it.  On this show.  Fuck that after shit.  I know, right?  We do it on the after show.  We do it on the after show if you don't get to it on this show.  Talked about how Troy didn't ruin my party for some reason.  You were coaxing him into throwing food around.  You don't want to party like a party guy at your party?  Look, I had a party like that.  At 8.30 the next morning, we were still all in the pool and the barbecue was still going.  Wow.  And that's how fucking that party was sick.  And you were giving Troy shit for not what? 
[03:04:00]  Spitting on my floor?  No, because...  Spits on my floor!  No, and throwing food and...  Who was still there at 8.30?  Eastside Dave, right?  Do you think I even know who was there?  But Eastside Dave stayed for the party.  Eastside Dave stayed for the duration.  Troy had said he was going to bring the party like Dave does.  And what I was saying was, Dave actually brought the party and Troy...  I never think anyone means that literally when they say they're going to bring the party like Dave does.  Because no one can bring the party like Dave does. 
[03:04:30]  Let's be honest.  It's my mistake for believing in Troy.  Dave, as it was brought up yesterday, Dave literally wanted to burn down E-Rock's wedding.  Torch it.  Just torch this motherfucker he said.  He put a candle under a table, and then he draped a tablecloth over the candle.  And said, let's torch this motherfucker.  Yes.  Like, he meant it.  Literally.  So when he goes to a party, he fucking, like, is insane.  Eric...  But why would you want to be around him? 
[03:05:00]  I don't get it.  Because someone that drunk and out of control is hilarious.  And Eric, in his wedding suit, who was filming Dave, thinking everything was fun, had to throw his camera down and run across the dance floor.  And put a fire around.  Put a fire around at his wedding.  Because he said, Dave is crazy like that.  I would be pissed.  Yeah, me too.  Oh, it was fabulous.  I have to admit, I would be pissed.  So Eric and his spats ran over there?  Yeah.  He had the spats on still.  Of course, he did in his fucking 1950s shoes.  Yeah.  Ah, what do you say, dame? 
[03:05:30]  Hey, what are you doing over there with that fire?  Why don't you light me a ciggy?  Ah, why don't you roast a pig on it?  Silly goose.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah.  Speaking of Eastside Dave, Silly Goose writes something, and this is something to consider.  If Howard donated, he says 10 minutes, which is hilarious on the salary, Ron and Fez could hire back Eastside Dave.  I think if Howard donated...  I'm not even going to exaggerate.  One minute.  I would say it's 10 seconds.  10 seconds would be enough of a raise for Eastside Dave. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I think you're right.  I would have to do a quick math problem, but I think it would be about 10 seconds.  About 10 seconds.  I don't know how that ever happened with Dave not being...  That was a mistake.  I mean, I just...  It's one of those things that's just...  That's a big surprise.  Whenever I see Dave...  I'm making a mistake.  I know.  Whenever I see Dave or hear him or something like that, or get a dumb fucking text from him,  I'm just like, that guy is hilarious.  That's why no respect for the cute bosses.  No.  They can't even figure that shit out. 
[03:06:30]  It was a dumb, tiny, and I mean tiny little raise.  And they probably just see him like, you know, it's Dave.  All right, get out of here.  But the genius behind that, was just fucking...  Lost.  Spectacular.  His dumb videos, it's just him, and it's so obvious.  It's like, oh, look, Dave's going to fall down the stairs.  Yeah, he's going to scream about something.  Dave's going to scream about something.  He's going to put his face into the camera, and then he's going to fall down and scream. 
[03:07:00]  It's hilarious every time.  I don't know what it is.  I can't stop watching these dumb videos.  He's going to open his eyes real wide.  Yeah, he's going to open his eyes real wide.  And then when he gets his kids involved, too, it's hilarious.  He did a whole video, and at the end, he just has a tag of his kid going,  no, no, no, no.  Just telling him no.  And he doesn't listen.  It's Eastside Dave country. 
[03:07:30]  I've got to give him a plug.  Dave's just a fun guy to hang out with.  If you liked drinking, you would want to hang out with Dave.  That's what it's all about.  I would want to hang out with Dave, but I would wind up like that guy at the Ed Sullivan Theater.  Yeah, kicking in windows and being arrested.  If you wanted people that would wonder why I don't drink, would that be you?  Exactly, that would be me.  That hits you close to home.  Yeah, it doesn't bother me, but I mean, oh, yeah, that's the guy I am.  But that would be like, you'd be in jail, and all of a sudden go like, why am I here?  I am wrecked everybody's good time guy. 
[03:08:00]  Really?  Yeah, I'm a cunt.  Would you be in jail going, please, please, I didn't murder anyone, right?  Please.  Oh, my God, imagine.  Do you know how many people have happened?  You wake up in jail and just go, oh, God, please.  Oh, constantly.  It's happened all the time.  Oh, my God, imagine.  People have that actual feeling?  There's guys in jail right now who've been in jail for 10 years who have no memory of the crime.  Oh, that's so.  And they genuinely don't.  They're in blackouts.  Holy shit.  That is straight.  I've seen interviews with guys like that.  There's guys that drunk drive, kill people, and have no memory of doing it.  They just know that they left the house to get a few drinks, and then something happened, 
[03:08:30]  and then the next thing they know, they're in jail.  They look up, they go, why am I here?  What happened?  I don't understand the blackout thing.  I've got to be honest with you.  I had my heavy drinking days.  It's behind me, too, but I never felt like I blacked out, and I had my moments.  Some people are blackout drinkers.  Some people aren't.  But what is that about?  Am I too, like, scared of losing control that I don't make sure?  Or is it something just physical in your body?  Maybe you didn't drink enough.  You probably weren't drunk enough.  Man, I'm telling you. 
[03:09:00]  Well, maybe you weren't a blackout drinker.  That's all.  I had my time.  I'm telling you.  Or maybe as you drink, the longer you drink, the more, like, you're after blackout.  Or did I have blackouts, and I just don't know?  You know what I mean?  Maybe, yeah.  Oh, that could have been.  You know, that was during the time before Twitter.  See, that's the best way to gauge if you've had a blackout.  You wake up.  And look at your Twitter?  You're hungover.  You start going through your Twitter, and you're like, whoa.  And it's time-coded, so you're like, I have no recollection of this entire block of time. 
[03:09:30]  And you're looking through your Twitter, and you're like, oh, boy.  I hope I didn't.  Oh, I did.  Are you joking?  I dropped that bomb.  I dropped that bomb.  I dropped that one.  Are you joking?  Not totally.  Wow.  But not like total blackouts, for me anyway.  I know some people, though.  But you read and go, oh, yeah.  But sometimes you read and you go, oh, fuck, yeah.  That's right.  I was having a conversation with that person.  I was doing this.  I was, yeah, yeah.  So sometimes you just feel like.  We're going to have to discuss the blackout thing maybe tomorrow, because I, I don't know.  I woke up in Central Park twice before. 
[03:10:00]  Holy shit.  Around three in the afternoon.  I look up.  I'm like, I'm at home.  No, really?  And no recollection of how you got there.  I went to the SNL party, and then the next.  I have a suspicion on how you got in the Central Park.  Maybe you're loitering with those gentlemen behind the trees.  No idea why you're there.  Hi, I'm curious.  Did you really have to brush your teeth from morning breath?  No.  Yeah.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  No.  Not the gi.  No?  None of the gi?  But no recollection that you were walking towards Central Park or any of that shit? 
[03:10:30]  No, because last time I was a asshole, someone yelled, I yelled, see you later, assholes.  And then the next day, like around 40 minutes.  Well, who was the asshole in the end?  The park.  Oh, yeah.  That's scary.  Yeah, it is scary.  It wasn't, but once you eat pancakes, you go look back and go, ah.  Round two.  And then everything's fine.  Once you eat pancakes.  I've woken up on the bathroom floor near the toilet after I was puking in the bowl.  Oh, that'd be funny.  And then, like, you remember feeling sick, and then you wake up, and you're on the bathroom floor, and you're kind of like, where are I? 
[03:11:00]  Oh, fuck, yeah.  I was sick.  Are you in the toilet?  Oh, no.  I shit myself.  I don't.  Oh, no.  I shit myself?  Let me say, in all my years of drinking, I don't think I've ever said, oh, yeah, I shit myself.  Don't eat messing in food before?  I've woken up in the bathroom, but at the time, I knew logically it was the best place just to fucking sleep. 
[03:11:30]  I knew I was going in to be sick, but then I just, like, passed out as I was being sick.  And that tile floor could be nice and cool in the summer when you're in the hangover.  Yeah, tile's nice.  I'm bringing back memories now.  But then you wake up and just, like, oh.  Right on your cheek?  Remember that?  Nice cold tile on your cheek, like, oh, in between puking?  And then I have to lay in bed with, like, the room at 60, 66, 67 degrees with a cold rag that I then, I put it on my head, but occasionally I got to just drag it over my entire body just to cool myself off. 
[03:12:00]  Because you're like, oh, this hurts.  My head is pounding there.  And then sometimes you got to have the medicinal beer.  This is the hardest one to put down.  Hold on a second.  Hardest one to put down.  But once it's down, you go, did I really ever feel bad?  You're like, I really.  And before that, you're going, like, I swear, I think I'm ready to die.  And then you drink the one beer and go, I really don't think I felt all that bad. 
[03:12:30]  I heard Jimmy loud and clear, though.  Oh, I did.  Are you ever sick?  Are you ever sick?  No, a beer.  Are you sick and tired of being sick and tired, as they say?  No, not yet.  I don't know.  Have you ever gotten to the point where you're just like, ah, this fucking beer?  Oh, there are some hangovers that I'll go, like, the week without drinking anything because it was that fucking bad. 
[03:13:00]  And I have no urge.  And it's like, it's it.  But then you're kind of like, eh, I can go for a cinnamon.  And then you're like, oh, why didn't I have a drink yesterday?  The problem is your tap is so delicious.  The taps are icy, cold, and wonderful.  And you know what else is great?  The clinkily clink of ice in a glass before you pour in some of that Captain Morgan.  You know what else is great?  It goes clinkity clinkity clinkity clink.  The crunchity bunch of metal as it crashes against the fucking family.  I don't drive, though. 
[03:13:30]  Well, no one plans on drunk driving.  No, I don't.  I would never.  I don't do that.  He takes a lot of training.  Not anymore.  When we're in blackouts, we do things that we don't know what, like a lot of people don't  commit murders, but then they're in a blackout and they run somebody over my black, my blackouts.  And and I won't even call because I remember everything I do.  But sometimes I just need a reminder in the morning.  It's like, oh, so I don't I could never see myself being so drunk that I'm like, I'll take my car out for a drive. 
[03:14:00]  That ain't happening.  I've talked to you in those conditions.  Yeah.  I always know.  I know.  I always know.  Anthony is really loaded.  Yeah.  When he repeats himself.  Oh, over and over.  Like, it would be like, and I just want to fucking get a piece of the pie.  Literally or figuratively.  What did I mean?  And then a minute or two later, we'll be talking and you're like, I don't.  I just want to get a fucking piece of the pie.  That's all I want.  I just want what's mine.  I put in my time. 
[03:14:30]  I just want what's mine.  And then she comes to the door and kicks my face in.  Listen, yeah, we're going to do blackouts tomorrow because we got a guy on the phone.  Call tomorrow, Mark.  Oh, my God.  Woke up in the snow with a couple inches of snow on him.  That's dangerous.  Another guy woke up in a crack house with someone feeding him a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  That's nice.  Blackout stories tomorrow because I don't really get it.  I really don't.  Yeah.  And maybe I maybe I have been blacked out and I just don't know it. 
[03:15:00]  I just feel like I that was so scary to me that I was conscious of it always.  I don't know.  I don't know.  So we should get into it tomorrow a little bit.  I'll see you guys Friday.  Yes.  Jimmy's leaving us for a couple days.  Oh, Yames.  Time for him to go back to Hollywood to become a big star.  A big star.  I'm never going to be a big star.  And I've kind of come to grips with that.  What are you doing in Hollywood?  I'm doing red carpet for the ESPYs for Leno.  And then I do Tonight Show Thursday.  Oh, that's big star stuff.  Don Rickles is the lead guest.  I'm very psyched.  Oh, shit.  Have you ever met him? 
[03:15:30]  Yes.  I have a photo with him, but I got it blown up.  I want to get it signed.  I love him.  But I'm glad we're doing the same show.  I just hope my piece is funny.  I wish Rickles.  I'm sure.  I won't be on panel with him, but I'll be on the same show right before he comes out.  I wish we were either older or he was younger, so we kind of matched up better.  Yeah.  Because he's an old guy now.  Still doing it.  Don't get me wrong.  But imagine Don Rickles in his fucking prime.  We could appreciate it.  I just hope they ask me to do promo.  Sometimes they'll ask me, like the last few times I've done it, they say, come out for  the promo.  Because the J will throw to the local. 
[03:16:00]  You guys don't see it here, but he'll throw to local news shows.  Hey, coming up, Bob.  We got da-da-da-da-da-da.  And I get to stand there with the other people on the show.  Tweak his nipples or something.  I'd love to.  Yeah.  But I want to do that with Rickles.  Just to stand there.  Call him a hockey puck.  He'll love that.  There's a funny clip of Don Rickles on Dennis Miller years ago.  He just doesn't even acknowledge my dumb remark.  No, but I mean, he goes through the whole thing about how great he is.  He goes, your timing is impeccable.  And Rickles just goes, fine.  And it's the fucking timing. 
[03:16:30]  And you're like, what a funny guy he is.  He just drilled him with fun.  But just, more importantly, once again, Jimmy picking out that one tiny thing.  Like the Johnny Cash yesterday with the guy playing.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jimmy's great at picking out that one little song.  I love that guy's head now.  All I can think about is that guy's head.  One comedian talking to another.  But you, undoubtedly, have the best timing I've ever heard of a comedian in my generation.  I mean, you stun me.  I just have to tell you that from a technique standpoint. 
[03:17:00]  Nobody makes me laugh as hard as you with timing jokes.  Fine.  Fine.  That is good.  Fine.  Fine.  It's just such a fucking...  Ah, fuck you.  Oh, what timing.  Fuck you.  Well, listen, it's so great.  Fine.  Fine.  Time for this day in ONA history as we lead you.  You're going to have to do live today, Sam.  On the 10 o'clock after the show.  Sorry, Sam. 
[03:17:30]  It's your responsibility now.  You're the man.  The big cheese.  The head of honcho.  Thank you.  This day in ONA history as we say goodbye.  Jimmy back Friday.  Unless I'm killed traveling.  No.  You're doing this every time.  I hope.  It was fun one time.  Don't do this every time.  You're a taunting fate.  No, I'm saying I don't want to be killed in a plane crash.  The 757s, I'm hoping, are well maintained.  They did find some cracks in the wings, I believe, but I think they've been fixed.  They're perfect.  The American Airlines fleet. 
[03:18:00]  Let's hope it's young and healthy.  Oh, yes.  Knock wood.  None of that pesky paint on it.  Yeah.  It's all aluminum.  Nice.  I hate when you see the silver shit.  What is that about?  It's great.  No, the silver patches of tape.  Oh, well, you know.  Some kind of strong tape or something.  You've got to slap sometimes a little chewing gum and straw.  Oh, boy.  Works just fine.  The Wright brothers used it.  This day in ONA history.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents. 
[03:18:30]  Presents.  This day in ONA.  In ONA.  Our favorite moments from this very day in Opie and Anthony history.  It was on this day back in 2007 that comedian Louis Twitchell Santani licked cake off another man's balls.  Well, the showstopper would be for somebody to lick Duffy's balls as he's got cake on it.  Well, it would be silly of me to leave Philly without maybe offering a couple of more hundred bucks.  Amen.  Let's get Twitchells in here.  He's bi.  We've got to ask Duffy.  You don't care if someone licks cake off your ball bag, do you? 
[03:19:00]  Uh, you want me to lick icing off a guy's ball sack?  It's not gay because it's cake.  Let's get this over with.  Let's get this over with.  Before the cops come.  All right, here we go.  He just shoved his, shoved his, shoved his, he shoved his, he shoved his, he shoved his, he shoved his, he shoved his ball bag right in his mouth. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, shit.  He's licking it now.  This has been This Day in O&A.  In O&A.  Our favorite moments from this very day in Opie and Anthony history. </pre>
