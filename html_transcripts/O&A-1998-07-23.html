<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion of the torrential rain in New York City and its impact on the city's odor.  This segued into a segment about a saleswoman, Lisa, caught playing a game called "Catch the Condom" – a game involving catching falling condoms with a penis-shaped icon – during work hours.  Lisa was brought on air to describe the game.  The show then moved to a listener call detailing how a shared laugh over a previous segment about comedian Adam Ferrara’s relationship with Anthony’s sister led to a successful date.

Next, the hosts discussed a recent crane accident in Times Square, playing a pre-recorded comedic bit by Brian Unger about New York's unusual accidents.  This prompted Opie and Anthony to announce a contest offering $10,000 to a listener injured by falling scaffolding bearing an Opie and Anthony sticker. The unexpected sighting of station employee Earl at work sparked a brief celebration, attributed to increased ratings.

A caller then accused Opie of performing oral sex in a bathroom stall at an office party.  Opie confirmed the allegation, providing a detailed and sexually explicit account of the incident.  The show's final segment touched upon the New York Yankees, the deaths of several celebrities including Alan Shepard and Robert Young, and reminisced about the children's show *Wonderama* and its deceased host, Bob McAllister. A former *Wonderama* guest called in to share negative experiences with McAllister. The broadcast ended with another comedic bit featuring Brian Unger, this one focusing on sound effects of defecation.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York with the Verve Bittersweet Symphony, the Talking Heads and the Goo Goo Dolls got us going today with Iris, it's Opie and Anthony.  Good afternoon.  How are you, bro?  Very well.  How was your ride in today?  A little strange, I gotta say that.  Why?  I'm going across the 59th Street Bridge and get about, yeah, almost halfway over.  And it looked like some of that clear plastic was hanging across the center of the bridge. 
[00:00:30]  And I go, I'm like, what is that?  And then it hits, whoa, it was rain.  It was like a wall of rain I drove into.  Wow.  It was pouring.  We needed that rain, though.  The city was really starting to smell really bad.  A little stinky.  A little stinky, we needed to hose everyone down.  It's the good Lord's way of showering the spit off the sidewalk.  Yeah, people were coming up to me going, man, the homeless people smell extra nasty today.  No, that's not the homeless people.  That's everyone out there. 
[00:01:00]  You can't help but smell on a day like today.  How come the guy with the parka and the dreadlocks still walks around with the parka when it's 97 degrees?  I don't know.  I don't understand.  Like, that's that big 70s snorkel jacket on.  Right.  The big boots.  Yeah.  The dreads, and it's 97 degrees.  97 degrees.  Great.  Oh, by the way, if you're a potential advertiser of the Opie and Anthony show, don't bother calling.  I found out that the salespeople are too busy doing other things than selling our lovely radio show. 
[00:01:30]  What are they doing?  I was horrified.  I was eating lunch today in the break room, trying to get together, you know, get the show going and stuff.  Yeah.  And I got to call her out on this.  You know, cute little Lisa?  Yeah.  Quiet Lisa?  Yeah.  Innocent looking Lisa?  Mm-hmm.  She admitted to us while we were eating lunch today that she's busy playing a game on her computer called Catch the Condom.  Weird.  Don't you have, you know, people to call to try to advertise on any W? 
[00:02:00]  No, she's busy playing Catch the Condom.  What's Catch the Condom?  I would love to get Lisa in here to explain what Catch the Condom is.  I bet you she's mortified now and she's hiding, but Lisa, if you're listening to our voices right now, run down the hall because we want to understand why you're spending valuable work time playing this lovely game on your computer called Catch the Condom.  She says it's a riot.  If it was lunchtime, the sales staff was probably off for a good two hours already.  Yeah.  Because that's like a full day's work by 10 o'clock or so. 
[00:02:30]  Well, I'm looking down the hall.  Oh, here she comes.  Come on, Lisa.  Let's see if she's brave to come in here and explain herself.  Come on in here.  Oh, she's giving me the finger.  Come on.  Come on.  Not the finger.  That's the Italian elbow.  All right.  Get over there.  Get over there.  I can't believe you guys.  Just because you don't know how to catch a condom or put one on doesn't mean they've got to pick on me.  Thank God I don't know how to catch a condom.  Oh, I don't know how to put one on, though.  Now, what is this?  I can't believe you.  All right, Lisa.  What are you playing? 
[00:03:00]  Now, explain to Anthony what this game is, but be careful.  You can't use the D word.  You can use the P word, though.  The P word.  Okay.  All right.  Go ahead.  Now, explain to Anthony.  And don't curse.  Well, you know, that's very hard for me not to do.  Uh-oh.  Okay.  What it is is it is a penis that goes back and forth along the bottom of your screen.  Right.  And through the keys, you have to make it go faster or slower to catch a condom that's coming down from the top of the screen.  And they have little crosses and little sharks.  Picture-like spacing, baby. 
[00:03:30]  The best part is they have ammunition.  Uh-huh.  You get ammo every time you swallow a condom.  Oh.  In the form of little sperm.  So you're shooting.  Oh, my.  Look.  This is what you're doing instead of working at NDW.  I dare you to try to do this because you won't be able to.  I'm not playing catch the condom.  Sorry.  Are you good at it?  No.  Not too bad.  No.  Why are you worried about that?  You don't want to play anyway.  It's true.  Oh. 
[00:04:00]  So has anything been sold?  Oh, yeah.  That's fine.  We're doing a ton of business upstairs.  Really?  I understand.  The sales department can work 20 minutes a day because they're that good at their job.  They're that good.  Oh, is that it?  They're that good.  And then the rest of the day, you guys are playing catch the condom.  No, the rest of the day, we're out making calls to drum up new business.  Wow.  A station that's in 20th place, such as NDW, sells itself.  Right.  But you're here.  And we're going up, babe.  That's right.  We're moving.  We're moving.  All right.  Well, thanks for explaining Catch the Condom.  Oh, and thank you.  My mother and father, I'm sure, because they do listen now. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you, too.  How does the little willy run on its little...  How do I say that?  All right.  I think we can figure out how they run across the screen.  Thanks, Lisa.  Thanks.  Wow.  Well, there you go.  All right.  Well, they have time to sell the station and play computer games.  Catch the Condom.  Catch the Condom.  She should at least send the game to us so we can play it in the studio or at least check  it out, you know?  You play Catch the Condom.  I don't want to.  All right.  Request line 212-757-1027.  The fax line here at NDW, 212-957-W-NEW. 
[00:05:00]  May I have your attention?  All potential advertisers, Lisa is standing by to play Catch the Condom.  How much do they have to advertise, Anthony, to play a game of Catch the Condom with Lisa?  I would say like maybe a $15, $20 buy.  $15, $20 buy on the Opie and Anthony show and you get to play Catch the Condom with Lisa.  Give us a call here at NDW.  1027-W-NEW, where a rock lives.  1027-W-NEW, the rock of New York with 7 Mary 3. 
[00:05:30]  That's their latest called Over Your Shoulder.  Pink Floyd before that.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Are you ready to admit now, Anthony, that you have now played Catch the Condom?  I just did.  You played Catch the Condom.  Went out to the computer to check it out.  It seems to be a favorite amongst the sales staff.  I don't know.  Yeah.  It's a little computer game.  Right.  Well, they got to keep busy.  The phone isn't ringing too much around here, so they got to, you know, keep busy doing other things.  And they found this lovely game that you can play on their expensive computers that I'm sure CBS Radio bought for all those guys up there. 
[00:06:00]  Just to play games on.  Just to play games.  And they were sick of solitaire, so they found this game Catch the Condom.  Well, I see.  I played it.  And there's a piece of male anatomy that goes across the bottom of your screen.  And condoms fall from the top of the screen.  Right.  And you got to watch out because there's a cross, I guess, representing the Catholic Church that goes around and pops the condoms before they make it down to you.  And if the cross hits your piece of male anatomy, it kind of goes soggy on you. 
[00:06:30]  If you know what I mean.  And then there's this killer condom that goes around with teeth on it.  Right.  And if it gets a hold of your piece of male anatomy on the bottom of the screen, it's an ugly, bloody scene.  It does a Lorena Bobbitt to you?  Yeah.  It does.  What a great game.  It's frightening.  Why didn't we have this when we were growing up?  We had a stupid Pong. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, but Pong was great.  Then he could also play Squash.  And what was the difference between Squash and Pong?  One paddle on Squash.  Right.  He bounced it against the wall.  Or play, um, uh, K-Pong.  Remember how they advertised that, though?  Five video games in one, and it was the exact same game.  They just made the paddles bigger.  It's one lousy game.  One lousy game.  And it burnt the TV screen, so you're trying to watch TV,  and you would see the image of the Pong game. 
[00:07:30]  My parents, God.  Yeah.  And we wrecked a TV or two in our household with the first video games out.  Yeah, they went for like a hundred bucks back then.  I remember going to the bowling alley in Huntington,  which is now a supermarket because no one really goes bowling anymore.  Anyone else notice that?  That all the bowling alleys have turned into supermarkets?  That's true.  But anyway, uh...  You have to pick the mic.  I hear that.  You hear that?  It's one of my nervous habits.  I do that.  Get your hand off of it.  All right, sorry.  Jesus.  Remember the video game?  All it was was in the middle of the screen was a tree. 
[00:08:00]  Right.  And then you had two gunslingers on opposite sides of the screen.  Yeah, I remember this.  And the only...  You know, you had the tree and you had to poke your head out and try to shoot the other guy.  Yeah.  The game would go on forever.  No one would die.  It was horrible.  But it was the most exciting thing ever because it was a video game.  Well, when Asteroids came out, that was huge.  That was huge.  And Space Invaders.  And Pac-Man.  Pac-Man was very big.  A lot of people were addicted.  Centipede was huge.  Centipede, mm-hmm.  But then they started wrecking the games because Pac-Man was great.  And then Ms. Pac-Man was kind of cool. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  And then they decided to take it to this wacky level where the Pac-Man became huge and the  whole screen, waka, waka, waka, waka.  Remember?  And then you had to shoot and stuff.  Right.  It wasn't enough that they came up with a good game.  They tried to keep increasing and making it better.  Ms. Pac-Man.  And then they had the baby Pac-Man.  Yeah, and it just got so confused.  It was like, what happened to my little game?  I just wanted to go around and eat the little dots.  I enjoyed regular Pac-Man. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  Why did you change it?  Why is it a huge Pac-Man now taking off the whole screen?  Donkey Kong I used to like, too.  Yeah, that was cool.  That was a good one.  And then it got to the point where computer games were just cheaper to bring home.  Mm-hmm.  So that kind of killed that out.  Atari.  Now forget about it.  You get like Sega systems and Nintendo 1 billion.  Right.  That's not that.  Real 3D grapples that actually come out and choke you.  Yeah.  Wow.  Pew, pew, pew.  Wow.  It punched me.  This game is great. 
[00:09:30]  How true, how true.  Oh, the listeners are killing me now.  Thanks, Anthony.  Why?  They're calling up and laughing at me.  1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York.  Here's Everclear.  And I will buy you a new life.  I think the listeners are right.  We should just shut up and play the music.  I don't want to hear about that anymore.  You a-hole.  1027-WNEW, where Rock lives. 
[00:10:00]  You're hanging with Opie and Anthony.  There's a guy on the line who says that he's got a date because of our show.  A date?  A date, yes.  Ronnie, what's up?  Guys are cracking me up.  You know, I'm driving, obviously, a flatbed.  You know, so I'm up and down with you guys.  And, uh, say a quick story.  Uh, I might have this future, uh, date tomorrow night with a girl because of you guys.  How did that happen?  I was driving down the road, and I started laughing at one of you guys, uh, when we're getting  there, and, uh, I look over to me, nice little girl.  I guess about 5'5", looking at about a buck ten, you know.  And I see her laughing. 
[00:10:30]  So I notice that way, like, the lady has the same stuff, and I go, she's got to be listening  to them at the same time.  And so I teleported down the window, I says, I told you Anthony, and she nodded, yeah.  And I says, uh, you always listening?  She goes, I try every time coming home.  So it ended up that, uh, she ended up with changing the numbers while we're driving here  down the LIE.  And, uh, well, are you exchanging the numbers as you're flying down the LIE?  Oh, yeah, you know.  How do you...  How do you...  You get the old hand signals, you know, of course, before you crash into the guy in front  of you hitting his brake.  So it looks like you're going to have a date with this girl because of our show. 
[00:11:00]  That's pretty much it.  Now, what bit were you guys listening to that you were both laughing at?  Yeah, he had the, uh, the Comic-Con, and he was going over with the, um, about Anthony's...  He went out with Anthony's sister?  Oh, yeah!  Oh, bro.  And you got ripping her apart?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, Adam Farrar, who's a famous comedian and Anthony's pal from childhood days.  Oh.  Anthony finally confronted him on the air about doing his sister.  Fowling his lovely young sister.  Sorry.  Oh, man.  I just...  I was having to walk out of the studio. 
[00:11:30]  I mean, how he sat there for it.  You know, I'm easier to point it on other people.  He just got it reversed.  And now, because of that, you got a date.  That is cool.  Yeah, no, definitely, uh, so far, it looks like it's pretty good.  So, we'll see you back tomorrow night.  All right, Ron.  Congratulations.  Hey, thanks, man.  You guys, keep it up, man.  I know you...  I know you got to be getting all that hate mail for real.  I know you got to be.  You're not just saying it because, uh, more or less, too, you know, have a lot of old-time listeners.  But, uh, I love it, and everyone else that I'm talking to, you know, we're all switching over, listening, and everyone's digging it, you know?  Hey, cool, man.  Thanks, man. 
[00:12:00]  You guys, keep it up, no matter what the pressure is, you know?  Yeah, we will.  Take it easy.  That's pretty cool, huh?  How a date.  See, you got to listen to the Opie and Anthony show, because you might, uh, get a date with somebody.  Now you'll hook up.  You might hook up, yeah.  That's wild.  All right, we're doing a lot of phones today, because they're ringing like crazy.  So, if you want, uh, to add, uh, something to the show, maybe about something we talked about earlier this week, or you got something new on your mind, give us a call.  212-757-1027.  Whose birthday is it?  I don't know.  The sales staff had time to bake a cake. 
[00:12:30]  What is going on in this place?  No, actually, this cake is to commemorate our first sale of the week, and it's only Thursday.  The sales staff is back down on the ninth floor again with a cake that they baked, because they have nothing better to do today.  Good, thank God.  I'm hungry.  Yeah, we are hungry.  But thank you for asking.  We found out today that the sales staff plays a game on their computers called Catch the Condom, and now they're walking in the studio with a cake to celebrate someone's birthday.  No one's working around here. 
[00:13:00]  No wonder we're in 20th place.  Up from 23, though.  With a bullet.  With a bullet in the head.  Let me get for the bullet.  I think we all need bullets in the head.  1027-WNEW, where Rock lives.  Here's Collective Soul, the world I know.  1027-WNEW, where Rock lives.  Heart's crazy on you.  One of the songs they always played during the laser shows.  Yeah.  They always played that one, and Blue Icicled Godzilla, threw in some Floyd and threw in some Zeppelin, and you had a great, great laser show. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Anyway, it's Opie and Anthony.  Hi, how are you?  What's going on?  Hey, speaking of Godzilla real quick, you saw the movie, right?  Yeah.  Did you finally see it?  No, I didn't finally see it.  I've got to ask you a question.  Okay.  After Godzilla kind of trounced on New York the first time, was there any traffic in New York after that?  Were people able to drive through Manhattan after that?  Yeah.  They were still driving around a little bit.  Sure.  So one crane falls down, and you can't drive down there. 
[00:14:00]  No.  But Godzilla could knock down entire buildings, but you can still kind of get around.  Oh, sure.  As long as you stay out of the affected areas.  Yeah, they were still getting around trying to catch Godzilla.  All right.  Yeah.  Okay.  I just wanted to know that.  All right.  Now that you brought up the crane, I've got to play this thing from yesterday.  What?  The Brian Unger thing.  Oh, is it the crane?  Oh, my God.  No, no, no, no.  Where we asked Brian Unger from Comedy Central his thoughts on the crane incident in Midtown. 
[00:14:30]  We got so much email overnight about this, so check this out.  Brian, closer to home, we need your take.  You're a news guy about the Times Square incident, the construction accident.  Very tragic.  Everyone's talking about it here in the city.  Yeah, I think it gets all New Yorkers starting to think about their fate here in this city.  Because you really do go in the most bizarre ways here.  When your number's up, it's up in such a huge way.  For instance, I know of a guy who was hit on the head by an air conditioner that fell out of a window and split his skull open. 
[00:15:00]  He's now dead.  I think that's a tragedy.  When a cab jumps a curb, it doesn't just bump into you.  It mows over eight people and a baby, you know, in the carriage and the au pair and everything.  It's very ugly.  Only in New York.  Imagine this woman, meticulous apartment, watching Sally, enjoying her day, thanking God she's alive.  It's a beautiful morning, a little hot, but she's grateful because she has air conditioning. 
[00:15:30]  And she hears a creaking sound, thinking it might be the wind, or perhaps there's someone down the hallway or someone coming to knock on her door.  No, it's a giant crane comes through the ceiling that lands on her, her television, and smashes her, makes her want to the carpet.  That's a bummer.  Again, tragedy in New York strikes in such a brutal way.  It's like a cartoon.  What happened to that lady?  It really is.  It's the far side.  You have the picture of the window and the crane falling outside. 
[00:16:00]  The whole angle of hearing the sound down the hall.  Maybe she thought it was her grandson coming to visit her.  Why?  I've told him to be quiet so many times.  That's awful.  And, no, it's a huge steel crane coming through the ceiling.  You know, sometimes things drop from the ceilings here in New York, like roach larva, or a light fixture or something.  No, a giant crane is coming through the ceiling.  It's probably the heaviest thing that could have possibly fallen on her. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, it's just a giant crane.  There's that giant crane again.  Gosh, I hate...  We are a city on the brink.  If Mayor Giuliani would like to do something about the quality of life, why can't he do something about those giant cranes?  Oh, man, is that funny.  Very good.  Tragic.  Can we do our crane contest that we were talking about off air yesterday, after the show?  The scaffolding contest? 
[00:17:00]  Want to explain it to the people?  Is the promotion department at NAW ready to...  I don't know.  See, I don't know.  No?  I don't know if it's ready yet.  Do we even have a promotion department at NAW?  Is there?  I don't think there is a promotion department.  We have a sales staff that likes to celebrate birthdays and play Catch the Condo, and we  don't even have a promotion department at NAW, and we wonder why we're in 20th place.  Up from 23, though.  Up from 23?  Come on.  Well, me and Anthony have this great idea, because there's a lot of buildings being built and stuff. 
[00:17:30]  Everywhere you look, there's scaffolding, cranes, construction.  Right.  What we want you guys to do, if you're walking around Manhattan, is to look up a lot.  And if you see an Opie and Anthony sticker, Opie and Anthony NAW sticker that we're going  to have made, hopefully in the very near future, if they like this idea, you look up, and if  it's on some of those construction sites, and that construction site falls on you, we  want to give somebody $10,000.  A piece of scaffolding with our sticker on it. 
[00:18:00]  Yes.  If you get struck with it, you will get $10,000.  $10,000 from you and I.  How about that?  Just a way to try to get more listeners for our show.  I think that's a pretty good promotion, considering a lot of things have fallen off the buildings  these days.  But if something falls on top of you, and it doesn't have the Opie and Anthony NAW sticker,  then you just lose.  No, then you just...  You lose badly.  Then you could sue the city, maybe, if you're still alive.  But no, if you get hit with a nice piece of steel, with a nice Opie and Anthony NAW sticker  on it, $10,000.  $10,000.  I think that's a pretty good promotion. 
[00:18:30]  Let's set the contest in motion, because we don't have a promotion department here, so I guess  we can make that decision ourselves, right?  Yeah.  Do you think?  I think we're part of the...  We are promotions.  Okay.  And sales.  All right.  And on air.  I know.  So after the show, what we'll do is we'll put Opie and Anthony NAW stickers all over the  construction sites, and if that falls on top of you, bring the piece of construction  that hits you in the head, and we'll give you $10,000.  All right?  Okay.  All right.  I like that.  Wow.  Phones ringing like crazy.  We'll go to them next.  1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York, with fastball in the way. 
[00:19:00]  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Wait a minute, everyone.  Hold on a second.  What?  I think Earl's working.  Oh, my God.  What are you doing?  Earl's working, everyone.  What are you doing, Earl?  Yeah.  Woo!  Grab that mic, Earl.  Earl, what are you doing?  We need to know what you're actually doing right now.  I've never seen you work.  I've been here a month, and look, you're actually working.  Before you know it, the radio station's giving you an 18th place.  I think so.  We're moving.  We're going up.  Earl, you're the key to the ratings around here. 
[00:19:30]  Don't you understand?  The harder you work, the higher we'll go in ratings.  Earl, what are you doing right now?  What are you doing?  Because this is the first time I've actually seen you work.  Basically, what we're doing is taking the CDs that are in the library that are old and  scruffy and scuffed up and replacing them with brand new shiny CDs.  Right.  Wait a minute.  Let me check.  Our ratings just went up a tenth of a point.  A tenth of a point.  I swear to God.  Very good.  Wow.  He gets $200 an hour to do that. 
[00:20:00]  So much to do.  He works with Scott, Scott Muni, for two hours, and then he wanders the hall for eight,  and they pay him for ten hours a day.  But today, you are working, Earl.  Thank you.  He's going to help.  I'll kill you both later.  Hey, I was kind of nice.  You don't have to kill me.  We could ask you about that.  No, we'll ask that next time.  I never knew a black guy could blush. 
[00:20:30]  He's blushing over there.  That's who you both.  All right.  The phones are doing pretty well today.  Want to take another one?  Sure.  I-N-E-W.  Opie, here's a question.  You can see if this room is true.  Were you ever caught receiving oral favors in a bathroom stall at a going-away party?  I got to go.  Why?  Who's this?  This is Fred from Merrick.  Hi, Fred.  I don't know what you're talking about. 
[00:21:00]  Why is everyone abusing me today?  I seem to recall that you were slightly intoxicated when the incident happened,  because I was the second person to walk in the bathroom.  You know, I got to stop answering these phone calls live.  Can we put a two-hour delay on our show so I can think of some of these things before I answer?  All right.  Well, listen.  I got to call you.  All right.  Well, hell with it.  Is it true?  Hell with it.  Yeah, it is true.  Oh, man.  What happened was I was at my office Christmas party, and I was talking to the two big bosses 
[00:21:30]  at the bar.  And while I was talking to the big bosses at the bar, this girl, she was playing with  my stuff right at the bar.  Jesus.  And being, you know, a hot-blooded male, she said, I'll be right back, and she went into  the ladies' room, and I followed her in there, and...  Sure, that'll be fixed.  No problem.  Just let me write you up.  Well, who are you talking to?  I got three customers online here. 
[00:22:00]  You idiot.  I'm telling you what...  I hear you.  I'm not listening.  I'm not listening.  I'm hearing you.  Will you put down the Powerball tickets?  I got something to say here today.  All right.  Well, listen to you on the radio.  I have to go.  I got five customers now.  You're a good man.  You're a good man, Charlie Brown.  Don't worry about Chewbacca.  Bye.  Oh.  You didn't even want to hear it.  I'm getting nailed today.  So what happened?  Finish the story.  You're pounding me about the girl I lost my virginity to over and over again. 
[00:22:30]  Who'd the one in the stall look like Jabba the Hutt?  You're going for the whole Star Wars trilogy?  Come on.  Can I just hit the commercials here?  No.  I want to know what happened.  I went in there.  I was sitting on the stall and she was, you know...  Oh, that's a class act, Dopey.  You really know how to romance these girls, don't you?  Yeah, that's kind of cute.  Hey, honey, come here.  Yeah, I picked out a special bedroom stall for you. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, that's lovely.  It was during the Christmas party, too.  Oh, good, good.  And then...  Nice holy time of year.  I was convinced no one saw me go into the ladies' bathroom.  Christmas party, you going into the ladies' room, no one will notice, okay?  Right.  So what happened?  I had a lot of gin and tonics in me and she was doing...  All right, enough.  And all of a sudden, this lady who happened to be the boss's wife said,  Oh, my God, that's Opie in the stall getting...  Right.  Oh, I thought you meant the lady was the boss's wife. 
[00:23:30]  No.  Oh, what are you saying?  No, that would be a good story, but no.  Oh, the boss's wife walked in and saw what was going on.  Well, she saw my...  She saw my legs and figured out that it was me.  And then, like, when I left the bathroom, everyone applauded.  Oh, great.  Got a saying ovation.  I was mortified.  All right, good.  Porky's.  Yeah, pretty much.  That's about it.  Man, the abuse is flying today.  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York.  Here's Creed in my own prison. 
[00:24:00]  Check it out.  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York.  Green Day time of your life.  It's Opie and Anthony for the ride home.  Mets and Brewers tied at five after eight innings.  Yanks don't play tonight.  Yeah, he's just on fire.  I get so ticked off when I open up the paper.  Yeah.  And you see that the Yanks lost.  You're like, oh, they lost.  Yeah, but it's like, come on.  Oh, I know.  But you just want them to, you know, get the best record in baseball.  History this year, you know. 
[00:24:30]  Keep winning.  They're like 10 to 15 games ahead of everyone in wins.  Isn't the old timer game coming up or something?  Yeah, it is.  It is, isn't it?  Actually, Don Mattingly said, no, no, no thank you.  No.  No, he's not ready to do that yet.  Isn't it sad?  Like, you realize you're getting a little older when the old timer game is, guys, you remember watching play.  Yeah.  I was like, that's not the old timer game.  Old timer is like if they dragged up the babe.  Oh, no.  Babe Ruth. 
[00:25:00]  Hey, it's the babe.  I love the game of baseball.  I just smoked and drank too much.  So now I got a cancer kazoo.  Do you know Babe Ruth was the first one to get a cancer kazoo?  Yes, I do know that, actually.  A little trivia for you.  A little baseball trivia.  See?  Showing our intelligence once again today on the show.  Baseball and broads.  That was the life for me.  How about that Lou Gehrig getting Lou Gehrig's disease? 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, that sucked.  How many odds of that happening?  Come on, that's not the same name.  That old gag, babe.  Come on, come up with new material, will you?  Yeah.  Just makes you feel a little old, though.  Yes.  You know what also is making us feel a little old is the people that dropped dead in the last few days.  Well, I see on the cover of all the papers, a couple of pictures of the dearly departed.  We have Alan Shepard. 
[00:26:00]  Famous astronaut.  By the way, I was right about that yesterday, because I look like an idiot.  You said he went to the moon in 61.  No, I didn't.  Yes, you did.  I did not.  He was the first in, like, space.  First man in, first American in space.  Space, right.  He missed out by, what was it, like, a few days.  A few days or something in 1961, and everyone laughed at me yesterday.  I don't know what you're talking about.  No, because we were talking about when he went to the moon.  And I said, well, he was the first one in space, I thought.  All right.  All right.  And Robert Young, of course, father knows best. 
[00:26:30]  Who can I bring up again?  Yeah.  I thought he was in the Abe Vigoda category.  He was supposed to be dead.  And a few people emailed us overnight and said, yeah, you're right.  I thought he was dead.  The Abe Vigoda category is celebrities that all of a sudden you read the paper and you found  out they died.  And you go to yourself, I thought they died years ago.  Mm-hmm.  A la Abe Vigoda.  A lot of people think the guy's dead, but he's still walking around.  Yeah.  Matter of fact, did you read the paper on Abe Vigoda?  No.  In the Daily News the other day, this is pretty funny. 
[00:27:00]  He walked by the crime scene of Irene Silverman's mansion on 65th.  Abe Vigoda?  Abe Vigoda.  Fish.  And I guess some of the people were joking, saying, hey, Fish, are you here to, you know,  help us out?  I'm sure he loves hearing that.  Yeah, but he was going to the park for a little walk, they said in the Daily News.  Still kicking.  Man, is this the nosiest town in the history of the world?  Gotta walk by the scene.  Well, besides that, you know, the papers, you know, a celebrity can't, you know, take  a dump without someone reporting on it in the New York papers. 
[00:27:30]  It's amazing.  So.  I was just a little troubled.  A little troubled.  Maybe it's just me.  But they got these two guys, Robert Young and Alan Shepard on there, and there was a  third guy that passed, a bit of my past, Bob McAllister.  Not even, not even mentioned in the papers.  In the papers.  Bob McAllister, you might remember from Wonderama.  If you're anywhere in the age bracket from, I don't know, what, between 30 and 40, maybe? 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, maybe even a little younger.  That whole thing, maybe a little younger, maybe a little older, you'll remember Bob McAllister  as being the host of Wonderama, a little kid show.  Hey, a little Bob McAllister for you.  This is from Kids and People 2.  Oh.  Yeah.  Come on, this will bring you right back.  Right?  I guess.  We make this young, and I hope, well, come on.  We have problems of our own.  Dinah, dinah.  Kids are people, too. 
[00:28:30]  Come on, sing.  Whack-a-doo.  Whack-a-doo.  Oh, he's dead.  I don't feel like singing.  Oh.  We do our best to do our thing just like the rest.  Ban-a-bana.  Ban-a-bana.  Kids are people, too.  Come on.  Yes, they are.  That's right.  Bob McAllister.  He's dead now.  Can you shut off your computer?  Why?  That's a haunting, haunting song.  Very haunting.  Well, there's a little web page that I found that has some info on Wonderama. 
[00:29:00]  Okay.  The guy went to Wonderama.  Three tapings of Wonderama.  It used to be on 205 East 62nd Street, right in Manhattan.  And it was on the old Channel 5, which was WNEW.  It was.  You were right.  Metacomedia Television.  Okay.  The tapings, get this.  The kids would arrive midweek at about 9 o'clock in the morning.  And the tapings would go for about 10 hours.  10 hours?  10 hours.  How many shows did they tape?  One. 
[00:29:30]  It took 10 hours for one taping?  10 hours, one taping.  You go to a Rosie taping, and it takes 61 minutes.  Doesn't matter.  For an hour show.  I know.  I guess keeping these kids in line.  Oh, wow.  They didn't supply lunch.  No lunch.  Only snacks.  During each break, McAllister would step away from the kids.  My guess is that a few of them got on his nerves and smoked like a chimney.  I remember once or twice he snapped at some kid who was being annoying.  Other than doing his bit for the camera, he never seemed to be interested in the kids at all. 
[00:30:00]  Maybe it might have been the pressure of an 8 or 10 hour long taping.  Wow.  Remember the big basement that they used to have the disco in?  Of course.  It was the same studio.  All they did was aim the cameras in the other direction and pull out the four dancing platforms and put some color lighting on.  Oh, you're wrecking it.  You're wrecking my childhood.  I believed all this.  At the end of the show, the kids would get, you know, junk like Silly Putty, Lenders Bagels, Good Humor Ice Cream, and grr, house, hot dog. 
[00:30:30]  And the kids said not many kids actually walked away with prizes, only a couple.  And then they'd have to usher the kids off because the 10 o'clock news set had to be set up in the same studio.  Wow.  And they'd drive off.  But, yeah, little memories from Wonderama.  I remember when I had Three Dog Night played.  I remember watching Three Dog Night.  And I always thought it was, it was so odd to see a rock band in there with the front row of kids, like three, four-year-olds sometimes, looking like they had to do the, they were doing the pee-pee dance. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Like dancing around.  And it's like, Jeremiah was a boop.  And then, like, a little kid would come up and grab onto the bass player's leg and, like, dance, do a little kid pee-pee dance, dance.  It was just, I would be like, yeah, get my agent on the phone.  Right.  I'm going to hit him with a ball-peen hammer right over the head.  It's like, I used to be somebody.  I used to be somebody.  Now I'm playing on Wonderama. 
[00:31:30]  Take you out with a little.  No, no, no, no more.  No, no, no.  Come on now.  Come on.  Check it out.  There it is.  Oh, man.  Bob McAllister, dead.  Please don't look at the room.  We'll be at the homes of our own.  Sing it, kids.  Our beat.  Sing it, I'll be damned, too.  And now, a song for Bob McAllister on N.E.W. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, baby.  Yeah, baby.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  The rock of New York.  New band on the music scene.  That's everything singing about.  Huge.  Song is called Huge.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Mets have taken the lead at 6-5.  Could this be the last out to right center field?  No.  Okay.  One out to go in the game.  What is this?  Sports radio? 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, sorry.  Sports radio?  Yeah.  Yeah, speaking of sports radio, you know how the papers, they always, you know, they say  like, Warner Wolf broke a story or someone else in town.  Yeah.  They usually credit the big sports guys for, you know, breaking a rumor or something that  ends up happening.  Okay, I'm going to break one right here.  What do you got?  Well, I'm telling you, I want to be the first in New York to say that Michael Jordan, Phil  Jackson, and Scotty Pippen will be playing on the Knicks next year. 
[00:33:00]  Whoa.  That's a bold statement.  So if the news and the post are listening right now, you could print that and you could  quote me on that.  I want to be the first to give that to New York.  All right.  Okay?  Okay.  Thank you.  Wow.  I'm impressed if that happens.  Thank you very much.  Like Kreskin.  What are the Powerball numbers?  Powerball.  What a nightmare.  No one won that stupid thing yet.  Now it's 180 million going into Saturday's drawing.  And on the news yesterday, they're all doing the news reports from the lines in Connecticut. 
[00:33:30]  And there's vendors selling pizza and soda and water as people wait hours to get their  Powerball tickets for a chance to win 180 million Saturday.  Great.  Blah, blah, blah.  All right.  Hey, because you were talking about Wonderama, see all these lines?  Every single one of these people have a memory of Wonderama.  A Wonderama story.  Well, Bob McAllister, the host, is dead at 63 years old.  You might remember him from the 70s, his show Wonderama, right here in New York on Metromedia 
[00:34:00]  Television, Channel 5.  Right.  Turn your head like that again.  That's really cool.  Oh, geez.  Sorry.  It's like Jimi Hendrix.  Yeah.  Yeah, so Bob McAllister's dead.  I know he's trying to...  Cut it out!  What are you...  You're chasing away our listener.  Stop it!  Sorry about that.  Okay, the Mets have won.  There you go.  We're just stalling. 
[00:34:30]  Well, you want to go to the phones and talk to someone that has some Wonderama memories?  Yeah, a little Wonderama memory.  AEW!  How you doing?  Good.  Are you the DJs?  This is the DJs.  What can we do for you today?  We're the Whack-O-Ridges DJs.  Ho-ho!  I was on Wonderama.  Do you want to give a shout out to someone?  How about a long-distance DJ?  I already go right already.  Ho-ho!  Let me tell you.  We're the Whacky DJs.  Okay.  All right.  What can we do for you?  I wanted to share with you that I was on Wonderama. 
[00:35:00]  You were on Wonderama?  Yeah.  Oh.  Isn't that awesome?  Dream come true.  What happened?  I have to say that I was very disillusioned by Bob McAllister.  Why?  He was a jerk.  Was he?  Yeah.  I actually got...  Did he take you in the back and try to work you like a puppet?  Well, two things.  One is, I got to...  I was sitting, like, right in the front.  So I, like, tapped him.  I wanted to talk to him about something.  Yeah.  And he goes, don't touch.  Don't touch.  I was like, oh, my God.  That was his line.  That was his pickup line.  You know, kids are people, too. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  He was full of it.  Whack-a-doo, whack-a-doo, whack-a-doo.  I got...  How was he whacking?  I got to play a game.  You got to play a game?  What did you play?  Pass it on.  Pass it on.  How did that work?  It's like a telephone, you know, where one kid, they tell them a riddle, and then they  have to pass it on to the next one.  Oh, right.  And it would end up totally different by the time it got on.  Yeah.  And I was actually the last little kid.  And at the end, he would always pick them up, you know?  Yeah.  Say, hey, you know, good for you, whatever.  Did he pick you up?  Yeah, he picked me up. 
[00:36:00]  And then he was all, you know, put on his good guy act.  He was all nice.  Oh, the boy guy's dead.  So you saw right through him when you were really young.  Yeah.  I was like, you're full of it.  I was like, give me a good toy.  All they gave me was a spirograph.  Now I'm going to be Mr. Finger Hyman.  What was his name?  Mr. Finkel Hymer?  Yeah.  It was Dr. Finkel Hymer.  I'm going to be Dr. Finger Hyman.  Come here.  Wack-a-doo.  Wack-a-doo.  You know that game where you have to eat the crackers and whistle? 
[00:36:30]  We're going to play, but we're not going to use crackers.  Wack-a-doo.  Wack-a-doo.  Oh, my Lord.  And I got to eat good humor ice cream.  Yeah.  Very good.  Well, thank you for the memory of Wonderama.  Sure.  Has anybody here got an aardvark?  Has anybody here got an aardvark?  Let me pull out my front pockets and my pants, and I'll show you the aardvark.  Come here.  Come here.  Well, I'm going to feed you this grouse hot dog. 
[00:37:00]  Obi and Anthony.  1027.  Back to the music.  1027-WNEW, where rock lives.  1027-WNEW, the rock of New York with eagle-eyed cherry and save two nights.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  Hey.  And it's time for our childish bit of the day.  Yeah.  We had a meeting yesterday, and we found out that we're allowed to do one childish bit  every show.  Right, Anthony? 
[00:37:30]  Is that one?  One, yes.  I don't think we've done anything childish today, do you?  No.  I don't think so.  And we didn't come up with any brand new childish bits today, so we got to play the one from yesterday.  All right.  When Brian Unger was doing his Charles Kuralt thing.  Charles Kuralt.  How many people do you know could do a Charles Kuralt impression?  Not many.  Not many.  So, you know, when he was doing that Sunday morning program, and at the end of the program,  he would have the sounds of nature and stuff, and he'd show a pond and ducks and stuff.  Yeah, and it would go on forever. 
[00:38:00]  It'd go on forever.  Exactly.  Well, Brian Unger from Comedy Central, he came up with this yesterday for us.  Check it out.  As we leave you on this Sunday morning, here's me taking a big poop.  Sometimes a poop is a good thing on a Sunday morning.  Something you'd like to share with your neighbors, your friends.  Here's me and the sounds of dumping. 
[00:38:30]  Oftentimes we don't have time to show you the poop.  Today, here's me taking a dump, and then me showing it to you.  Oftentimes we like to leave our viewers with a little something from the outside.  Today, it's me taking a poop.  Here's me running to the outhouse to take a big old hairy. 
[00:39:00]  And as we leave you on this Sunday morning, the sounds of pooping.  Because there's nothing better than a good poop.  Jesus.  I'll be inampity. </pre>
