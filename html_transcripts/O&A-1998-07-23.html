<pre> 1027WNEW, the Rock of New York with the verve, bittersweet symphony, the talking heads and  the goo goo dolls got us going today with Iris, it's OP and Anthony.  Good afternoon.  How are you bro?  Very well.  How was your ride in today?  A little strange, I gotta say that.  Why?  I'm going across the 59th street bridge and get about almost half way over and it looked  like some of that clear plastic was hanging across the center of the bridge and I go up 
[00:30]
 like what is that?  And then it hits, wow, it was rain.  It was like a wall of rain I drove into.  Wow.  It was pouring.  We needed that rain though.  The city was really starting to smell really bad.  A little stinky.  A little stinky, we needed to hose everyone down.  It's the good Lord's way of showering the spit off the sidewalk.  People were coming up to me going, man the homeless people smell extra nasty today.  No that's not the homeless people, that's everyone out there. 
[01:00]
 You can't help but smell on a day like today.  How come the guy with the parka and the dreadlocks still walks around with the parka when it's  97 degrees?  I don't know, I don't understand.  That's that big 70's snorkel jacket on.  The big boots, the dreads and it's 97 degrees.  97 degrees, great.  Oh by the way, if you're a potential advertiser of the Opie and Anthony show, don't buy the  calling.  I found out that the sales people are too busy doing other things than selling our lovely 
[01:30]
 radio show.  What did they do?  I was horrified.  I was eating lunch today in the break room trying to get together, get the show going  and stuff.  And I got to call her out on this.  You know cute little Lisa?  Yeah.  Quiet Lisa?  Yeah.  Innocent looking Lisa?  Mm hmm.  She told us while we were eating lunch today that she's busy playing a game on her computer  called Catch the Condom.  Oh my God.  Don't you have people to call to try to advertise on NEW? 
[02:00]
 No, she's busy playing Catch the Condom.  What's Catch the Condom?  I would love to get Lisa in here to explain what Catch the Condom is.  I bet you she's mortified now and she's hiding.  But Lisa, if you're listening to our voices right now, run down the hall because we want  why you're spending valuable work time playing this lovely game on your computer called Catch  the Condom.  She says it's a riot.  If it was lunchtime, the sales staff was probably off for a good two hours already.  Yeah.  Because that's like a full day's work by ten o'clock or so. 
[02:30]
 Well, I'm looking down the hall.  Here she comes.  Come on Lisa.  Let's see if she's brave to come in here and explain herself.  Come on in here.  Oh, she's giving me the finger.  Come on.  Come on.  Get over there.  Get over there.  I don't believe you guys.  Just because you don't know how to catch a condom or put one on doesn't mean they've  got to pick on me.  Thank God I don't know how to catch a condom.  You don't know how to put one on though.  I don't believe you.  What are you playing?  Now explain to Anthony what this game is, but be careful. 
[03:00]
 You can't use the D word.  You can use the P word though.  The P word, okay.  All right, go ahead.  Now explain to Anthony and don't curse.  Well, you know, it's very hard for me not to do.  Okay, what it is is it is a game of catch the condom.  It's a game of catch the condom.  It's a game of catch the condom.  Okay, what it is is it is a penis that goes back and forth along the bottom of your screen  and through the keys you have to make it go faster or slower to catch a condom that's  coming down from the top of the screen.  And they have little crosses and little sharks.  Picture like space. 
[03:30]
 And the best part is they have ammunition.  You get ammo every time you swallow a condom in the form of little sperm.  You shoot.  Oh my.  Look.  This is what you're doing instead of working at any W.  I dare you to try to do this because you won't be able to.  I'm not playing catch the condom.  Sorry.  Are you good at it?  No.  Not too bad.  No.  Why are you worried about that?  You don't want to play anyway.  So has anything been sold? 
[04:00]
 Oh yeah.  We're doing a ton of business upstairs.  Really?  The sales department can work 20 minutes a day because they're that good at their job.  They're that good.  And the rest of the day you guys are playing catch the condom.  No.  The rest of the day we're out making calls to drum up new business.  Wow.  A station that's in 20th place such as any W sells itself.  Right.  You're here.  And we're going up, babe.  That's right.  We're moving.  We're moving.  All right.  Well thanks for explaining catch the condom.  Oh thank you.  My mother and father I'm sure because they do listen now. 
[04:30]
 Thank you too.  How does the little Willie run on its little...  How do I say that?  All right.  I think we can figure out how they run across the screen.  Thanks Lisa.  Thanks.  Wow.  Well there you go.  All right.  Well they have time to sell the station and play computer games.  Catch the condom.  Catch the condom.  She should at least send the game to us so we can play it in the studio or at least check  it out, you know.  You play catch the condom.  I don't want to.  All right.  Request line 212-757-1027.  The fax line here at NAW.  212-957-W-NAW.  May I have your attention. 
[05:00]
 All potential advertisers.  Lisa is standing by to play catch the condom.  How much do they have to advertise Anthony to play a game of catch the condom with Lisa?  I would say like maybe a $15, $20 buy.  $15, $20 buy in the Opie and Anthony show and you get to play catch the condom with Lisa.  Give us a call here at NAW.  1027-W-NAW where rock lives.  1027-W-NAW the rock of New York with Seven Married Three.  That's their latest called Over Your Shoulder. 
[05:30]
 Pink Floyd before that.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, are you ready to admit now Anthony that you have now played catch the condom?  I just did.  You played catch the condom.  I went out to the computer to check it out.  It seems to be a favorite amongst the sales staff.  I don't know.  Yeah.  It's a little computer game.  Right.  Well, they got to keep busy.  The phone isn't ringing too much around here so they got to, you know, keep busy doing  other things and they found this lovely game that you can play on their expensive computers 
[06:00]
 that I'm sure CBS radio bought for all those guys up there.  Just to play games on.  Just to play games.  And they were sick of solitaire so they found this game catch the condom.  Well, I see.  I played it and there's a piece of male anatomy that goes across the bottom of your screen  and condoms fall from the top of the screen.  Right.  And you got to watch out because there's a cross, I guess representing the Catholic  church that goes around and pops the condoms before they make it down to you.  And if the cross hits your piece of male anatomy, it kind of goes soggy on you. 
[06:30]
 You know what I mean?  And then there's this killer condom that goes around with teeth on it.  Right.  And if it gets a hold of your piece of male anatomy on the bottom of the screen, it's  an ugly, bloody scene.  It does a Lorena Bobbitt to you?  Yeah, it does.  What a great game.  It's frightening.  Why didn't we have this when we were growing up?  We had a stupid pong. 
[07:00]
 Oh, but pong was great.  Then you could also play squash.  And what was the difference between squash and pong?  One paddle on squash.  Right.  To bounce it against the wall.  Or play ping pong.  Remember how they advertise that though?  Five video games in one and it was the exact same game.  They just made the paddles bigger.  It's one lousy game.  One lousy game.  And it burnt the TV screen so you're trying to watch TV and you would see the image of  the pong game in it.  My parents, God. 
[07:30]
 Yeah.  And we wrecked a TV or two in our household with the first video games out.  Yeah, they went for like a hundred bucks back then.  I remember going to the bowling alley in Huntington, which is now a supermarket because no one  really goes bowling anymore.  Anyone else notice that?  That all the bowling alleys have turned into supermarkets.  That's true.  But anyway, you have to pick the mic.  I hear that.  You hear that?  One of my nervous habits, I do that.  Get your hand off of that.  All right, sorry.  Jesus.  Remember the video game?  All it was was in the middle of the screen was a tree.  Right.  And then you had two gunslingers on opposite sides of the screen.  I remember this.  And the only, you know, you had the tree and you had to poke your head out and try to shoot 
[08:00]
 the other guy.  Yeah.  The game would go on forever.  No one would die.  It was horrible.  But it was the most exciting thing ever because it was a video game.  Well, when Asteroids came out, that was huge.  That was huge.  That and Space Invaders.  And Pac-Man.  Pac-Man was very big.  Center Pete.  A lot of people were addicted.  And then you had the big, you know, the big, the big, the big, the big, the big, the big,  the games because Pac Man was great.  But then they started wrecking the games because Pac Man was great.  And then Miss Pac Man was kind of cool. 
[08:30]
 And then they decided to take it to this wacky level where the Pac Man became huge and the  whole screen walka.  Walka.  Walka.  Walka.  Walka.  Remember.  And then you had to shoot stuff.  It wasn't enough that they came up with a good game and they tried to keep increasing  and making it better.  It is Pac-Man and then they had the baby Pac-Man.  Yeah, and it just got so confusing.  It was like, what happened to my little game?  I just wanted to go around and eat the little dots.  I enjoyed regular Pac-Man. 
[09:00]
 Right.  Why did you change it?  Why is it a huge Pac-Man now taking up the whole screen?  Donkey Kong I used to like too.  Yeah, that was a good one.  And then it got to the point where computer games were just cheaper to bring home.  So that kind of killed that out.  Atari.  Now forget about it.  You get like Sega systems and Nintendo one billion.  Right.  Real 3D grapples that actually come out of Tokyo.  Yeah.  Oh.  It punched me.  This game is great. 
[09:30]
 How true, how true.  The listeners are killing me now.  Thanks, Anthony.  Why?  They're calling up and laughing at me.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York.  Here's Everclear.  And I will buy you a new life.  I think the listeners are right.  We should just shut up and play the music.  I don't want to hear about that anymore.  UAO.  1027 WNEW, where Rock lives. 
[10:00]
 You're hanging with Opie and Anthony.  There's a guy on the line who says that he's got a date because of our show.  A date?  A date, yes.  Hey, Johnny, what's up?  Guys are cracking me up.  I'm driving obviously flatbed.  So I'm up and down listening to you guys.  Say a quick story.  I might have this future date tomorrow night with a girl because of you guys.  How did that happen?  I was riding on the road and I saw a lady and one of you guys, well, Yannick's there.  I look over to me, nice little girl, I guess about 5'5".  We're about a buck 10".  And I see her laughing. 
[10:30]
 So I notice that way.  I think the lady had the same stuff and I go, she's got to be listening to them at the  same time.  So I tell her down the window, I says, I told Opie Anthony and she nodded yeah.  And I says, you always listening?  She goes, I try every time coming home.  So it ended up that she ended up with changing the numbers while we're driving here down  LIE.  And it's fine.  Did you exchange the numbers as you were flying down the LIE?  Oh yeah, you know.  How do you?  You get the old hand signals, you know, of course before you crash into the guy in front  of you, you hit his brakes.  So it looks like you're going to have a date with this girl because of our show. 
[11:00]
 That's pretty much it.  Now what bit were you guys listening to that you were both laughing at?  You had the Comic-Con and he was going over with the Opie Anthony.  He went out with Anthony's sister?  Oh yeah.  Oh bro, you got ripping her apart?  Oh my god.  Yeah, Adam Perrar, who's a famous comedian and Anthony's pal from childhood days.  Anthony finally confronted him on the air about doing his sister, fouling his lovely young  sister.  Oh man, I just had to walk out of the studio. 
[11:30]
 I mean, how he sat there for it.  He's just reporting on other people.  He just got to reverse.  Now because of that you got a date.  That is cool.  Yeah, no, definitely so far it looks like it's pretty good.  So we'll see about tomorrow night.  All right, Ron, congratulations.  Hey, hey, and you guys keep it up, man.  I know you got to be getting all that hate and all for real.  I know you got to be, you know, just saying it because we're going to have a lot of old  time listeners.  But I love it and everyone else I'm talking to, you know, we're all switching over listening  and everyone's digging it, you know.  Hey, cool, man.  Thanks, man.  You guys keep it up no matter what the pressure is.  You know, I'm going to be talking to you guys.  I'm going to be talking to you guys. 
[12:00]
 You know, we definitely will.  Take it easy.  That's pretty cool, huh?  I would date.  So you got to listen to the Opie and Anthony show because you might get a date with somebody.  Now you'll hook up.  You might hook up.  Yeah, that's wild.  All right.  We're doing a lot of phones today because they're ringing like crazy.  So if you want to add something to the show, maybe about something we talked about earlier  this week or you got something new on your mind, give us a call.  212-757-1027.  Whose birthday is it?  I don't know.  The salesman had time to bake a cake.  What is going on? 
[12:30]
 No, actually, this cake is to commemorate our first sale of the week and it's only Thursday.  The sales staff is back down on the ninth floor again with a cake that they baked because  they have nothing better to do today.  Good.  Thank God.  I'm hungry.  Yeah, we are hungry.  But thank you for asking.  We found out today that the sales staff plays a game on their computers called Catch the  Condom and now they're walking in the studio with a cake to celebrate someone's birthday.  No one's working around here. 
[13:00]
 No underwear in 20th place.  Up from 23 though.  With a bullet.  With a bullet in the head.  Let me get to the bullet.  I think we all need bullets in the head.  1027-WNEW where rock lives.  Here's Collective Soul, the world I know.  1027-WNEW where rock lives.  Heart's crazy on you.  One of the songs they always play during the laser shows.  Yeah.  They always played that one in Blue Ice, the cult Godzilla, throwing some Floyd and throwing 
[13:30]
 some Zeppelin.  You had a great, great laser show.  Anyway, Sophie and Anthony, hi, how are you?  What's going on?  Speaking of Godzilla real quick, you saw the movie, right?  Did you finally see it?  No, I didn't finally see it.  I've got to ask you a question.  Okay.  After Godzilla kind of trounced on New York the first time, was there any traffic in New  York after that?  Were people able to drive through Manhattan after that?  Yeah, they were still driving around a little bit.  So one crane falls down and you can't drive down there? 
[14:00]
 No.  Godzilla could knock down entire buildings, but you could still kind of get around.  Oh, sure.  As long as you stay out of the affected areas.  Yeah, they were still getting around trying to catch Godzilla.  All right.  Yeah.  Okay.  I just wanted to know that.  All right, now that you brought the crane, I've got to play this thing from yesterday.  What?  The Brian Unger thing.  Oh, with the crane.  Oh, my God.  No, no, no, no.  We asked Brian Unger from Comedy Central his thoughts on the crane incident in Midtown. 
[14:30]
 We got so much email overnight about this, so check this out.  Brian, closer to home, we need your take, your news guy about the Times Square incident,  the construction accident.  Very tragic.  Everyone's talking about it here in the city.  Yeah, I think it gets all New Yorkers starting to think about their fate here in this city  because you really do go in the most bizarre ways here.  When your number's up, it's up in such a huge way.  For instance, I know of a guy who was hit on the head by an air conditioner that fell 
[15:00]
 out of a window and split his skull open.  He's now dead.  I think that's a tragedy.  When a cab jumps a curb, it doesn't just bump into you.  It mows over eight people and the baby in the carriage and the au pair and everything.  It's very ugly.  Only in New York.  Imagine this woman, meticulous apartment, watching Sally, enjoying her day, thanking  God she's alive.  It's a beautiful morning, a little hot, but she's grateful because she has air conditioning. 
[15:30]
 She hears a creaking sound, thinking it might be the wind or perhaps there's someone down  the hallway or someone coming to knock on her door.  No, it's a giant crane that's moving through the ceiling that lands on her television and  smashes her, makes her want to hit the carpet.  That's a bummer.  Again, tragedy in New York strikes in such a bizarre way.  It's like a cartoon, what happened to that lady.  It really is.  It's the far side.  You have the picture of the window and the crane falling outside. 
[16:00]
 The whole angle of hearing the sound down the hall, maybe she thought it was her grandson  coming to visit her.  Why?  Did he need that detail?  He told him to be quiet so many times.  That's awful.  No, it's a huge steel crane coming through the ceiling.  Sometimes things drop from the ceiling here in New York like roach larvae or a light fixture  or something.  No, a giant crane is coming through the ceiling.  Probably the heaviest thing that could have possibly fallen on her. 
[16:30]
 Oh, it's just a giant crane.  There's that giant crane again.  Gosh, I hate it.  We're a city on the brink.  If Mayor Giuliani would like to do something about the quality of life, why can't he do  something about those giant things?  Oh man, is that funny.  Very good.  Tragic.  Can we do our crane contest that we were talking about off air yesterday after the show?  The scowling contest? 
[17:00]
 Want to explain it to the people?  Is the promotion department at NAW ready to...  I don't know.  Is the promotion...  No?  I don't know if it's ready yet.  Do we even have a promotion department at NAW?  Is there?  I don't think there is a promotion department.  We have a sales staff that likes to celebrate birthdays and play catch the condo and we don't  even have a promotion department at NAW and we wonder why we're in 20th place.  Up from 23 though.  Up from 23, come on.  Well, me and Anthony have this great idea because there's a lot of buildings being built and 
[17:30]
 stuff.  Everywhere you look there's scaffolding, cranes, construction.  Why not?  Why not?  So what we want you guys to do if you're walking around Manhattan is to look up a lot.  If you see an Opie and Anthony sticker, Opie and Anthony NAW sticker that we're going to  have made hopefully in the very near future if they like this idea, you look up and if  it's on some of those construction sites and that construction site falls on you, we want  to give somebody $10,000.  A piece of scaffolding with our sticker on it. 
[18:00]
 Yes.  If you get struck with it, you will get 10 grand.  10 grand from you and I.  How about that?  Yes.  Just a way to try to get more listeners for our show.  I think that's a pretty good promotion considering a lot of things are falling off the buildings  these days.  But if something falls on top of you and it doesn't have the Opie and Anthony NAW sticker,  then you just lose.  No, then you lose badly.  Then you could sue the city maybe if you're still alive.  But no, if you get hit with a nice piece of steel with a nice Opie and Anthony NAW sticker  on it, 10 grand.  10 grand.  I think that's a pretty good promotion. 
[18:30]
 Let's set the contest in motion because we don't have a promotion department here so  I guess we can make that decision ourselves, right?  Yes.  Do you think?  I think we are promotions and sales.  All right.  And on air.  I know.  After the show, what we'll do is we'll put Opie and Anthony NAW stickers all over the  construction sites.  If that falls on top of you, bring the piece of construction that hit you in the head and  we'll give you $10,000.  All right?  Okay.  All right.  I like that.  Wow.  Phones are ringing like crazy. 
[19:00]
 We'll go to them next.  1027W NAW, the Rock of New York with Fastball and the Way.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Wait a minute, everyone.  Hold on a second.  What?  I think Earl's working.  Oh my God.  Earl's working, everyone.  What are you doing, Earl?  Come here.  Grab that mic, Earl.  Earl, what are you doing?  We need to know what you're actually doing right now.  I've never seen you work.  I've been here a month and look, you're actually working.  Before you know it, the radio station's giving you an 18th place.  I think so.  We're moving.  We're going up.  Earl, you're the key to the ratings around here. 
[19:30]
 Don't you understand?  The harder you work, the higher we'll go in ratings.  Earl, what are you doing right now?  What are you doing?  This is the first time I've actually seen you work.  Basically, what we're doing is taking the CDs that are in the library that are old and  scruffy and scuffed up and replacing them with brand new, shiny CDs.  Right.  Wait a minute.  Let me check.  Our ratings just went up a tenth of a point.  That's a whole point, Earl.  I swear to God.  Very good.  Wow.  He gets $200 an hour to do that. 
[20:00]
 I do.  He works with Scott, Scott Muny, for two hours and then he wanders the hall for eight and  they pay him for ten hours a day.  But today, you are working, Earl.  Thank you.  He's going to hell.  I'll kill you both later.  Hey, I was kind of nice.  You don't have to kill me.  We could ask you about the...  No, we'll ask that next time.  I never knew a black guy could blush.  He's a black guy.  He's a black guy.  He's a black guy.  He's a black guy.  He's a black guy.  He's a black guy.  He's a black guy.  He's a black guy.  He's a black guy. 
[20:30]
 He's blushing over there.  That's who you both.  All right.  The phones are doing pretty well today.  Want to take another one?  Yeah, sure.  I.N.E.W.  Here's a question.  You can see if this room is true.  Were you ever caught receiving oral favors in a bathroom stall at a going away party?  I got to go.  Why?  Who's that?  This is Fred from Merrick.  Hi, Fred.  I don't know what you're talking about. 
[21:00]
 Why is everyone abusing me today?  I seem to recall that you were slightly intoxicated when the incident happened because I was the  second person to walk into the bathroom.  I got to stop answering these phone calls live.  Can we put a two hour delay on our show so I can think of some of these things before  I answer?  All right.  Well, listen, I got a call coming out.  All right.  Well, hell with it.  Is it true?  Hell with it.  I got a call coming out.  I got a call coming out. 
[21:30]

I got a call coming out.  I got a call coming out.  I got a call coming out.  I got a call coming out.  I got a call coming out.  I got a call coming out.  I got a call coming out.  I got a call coming out.  I got a call coming out.  Man, the abuse is flying today.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, here's Creed at my own prison. 
[24:00]
 Check it out.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, Green Day, time of your life.  It's Ophi and Anthony for the ride home.  Mets and Brewers tied at five after eight innings.  Yanks don't play tonight.  Yanks is just on fire.  I get so ticked off when I open up the paper and you see that the Yanks lost.  They lost.  It's like, come on.  I know, but you just want them to get the best record in baseball history this year. 
[24:30]
 Keep winning.  They're like 10 to 15 games ahead of everyone in wins.  Isn't the old timer game coming up or something?  Yeah, it is.  It is, isn't it?  Actually, Don Mattingly said, no, no thank you.  No.  He's not ready to do that yet.  Isn't it sad?  You realize you're getting a little older when the old timer game is guys you remember watching  play.  Yeah.  It was like, that's not the old timer game.  Old timers, but like if they dragged up the babe.  Oh no.  Babe Ruth.  Hey, it's the babe. 
[25:00]
 I love the game of baseball.  I just smoked and drank too much.  So now I got a cancer gazoo.  Do you know Babe Ruth was the first one to get a cancer gazoo?  Yes, I do know that actually.  A little trivia for you, a little baseball trivia.  See?  Shown on our intelligence once again today.  You know, I'm a baseball fan.  I'm a baseball fan.  I'm a baseball fan.  I'm a baseball fan.  I'm a baseball fan.  I'm a baseball fan.  I'm a baseball fan.  I'm a baseball fan.  I'm a baseball fan.  baseball trivia.  See?  Shown on our intelligence once again today on the show.  Baseball and broads.  That was the life for me.  How about that little Gary getting a little Gary disease.  Yeah, that sucked.  How did that happen?  Come on.  That's not a game.  Got the same name.  That old gag babe. 
[25:30]
 Come on.  Come up with new material, will you?  Yeah.  Just makes you feel a little old though.  Yes.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm a baseball fan.  I'm a baseball fan.  I'm a baseball fan.  I'm a baseball fan.  I'm a baseball fan.  I'm a baseball fan.  I'm a baseball fan.  I'm a baseball fan.  I'm a baseball fan.  I'm a baseball fan.  So that's the way it is.  I don't think people are a fan.  That can be surprising for them.  As can one.  Really?  Aron man wants to play...  Get into the Chronicles.  Let's see.  I'm reaching for a diye baby baby.  Arcade.  Out. 
[26:00]
 Come on. ₀⤯ overcrowded.  Okay.  You're here for the Pelage.  What do you see on the Moon boy?  Early-小, Yes.  Â1 liegen anlide'  Stressed, jealous?  I feel something on my brain.  Yes.  You tell me.  I don't know where that is.  He missed out by a few days or something in 1961 and everyone laughed at me yesterday.  I don't know what you're talking about.  We were talking about when he went to the moon and I said he was the first one in space.  And Robert Young, of course, father knows best. 
[26:30]
 Who can I bring up again?  I thought he was in the Abe Bogota category.  He was supposed to be dead.  And a few people emailed us overnight and said, �Yeah, you're right.  I thought he was dead.� The Abe Bogota category is celebrities that all of a sudden you read  the paper and you found out they died and you go to yourself, �I thought they died  years ago, a la Abe Bogota.� A lot of people think the guy is dead but he's still walking  around.  As a matter of fact, did you read the paper on Abe Bogota?  In the Daily News the other day?  This is pretty funny. 
[27:00]
 He walked by the crime scene of Irene Silverman's mansion on 65th.  Abe Bogota?  Abe Bogota.  Fish.  And I guess some of the people were joking saying, �Hey, Fish, are you here to help  us out?� I'm sure he loves hearing that.  He was going to the park for a little walk they said in the Daily News.  Still kicking.  Man, is this the nosiest town in the history of the world?  Got to walk by the scene.  Well, besides that, the papers, a celebrity can't take a dump without someone reporting 
[27:30]
 on it in the New York papers.  It's amazing.  I was just a little troubled.  A little troubled.  Maybe it's just me.  But they got these two guys, Robert Young and Alan Shepard on there.  There was a third guy in the past.  A bit of my past.  Bob McAllister.  Not even mentioned in the papers.  Bob McAllister, you might remember from Wondorama.  If you're anywhere in the age bracket from, I don't know, between 30 and 40 maybe. 
[28:00]
 Maybe even a little younger.  That whole thing, maybe a little younger, maybe a little older, you'll remember Bob  as being the host of Wondorama.  Little kid show.  Hey, little Bob McAllister for you.  This is from Kids Are People 2.  Oh yeah.  Come on, this will bring you right back.  Right?  I guess.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on. 
[28:30]
 Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  I don't feel like singing.  We do our best to do our thing just like the rest.  Kids Are People 2.  Come on.  Yes, they are.  That's right.  Bob McAllister.  He's dead now.  Can you shut off your key later?  Why?  That's a haunting song.  Very haunting.  Well, there's a little web page that I found that has some info on Wondorama. 
[29:00]
 Okay.  A guy went to Wondorama.  Three tapings of Wondorama.  It used to be on 205 E 62nd Street, Manhattan.  And it was on the old Channel 5, which was WNEW.  It was.  Metro Media Television.  Okay.  The tapings, get this, the kids would arrive mid-week at about 9 o'clock in the morning.  And tapings would go for about 10 hours.  10 hours?  10 hours.  How many shows did they tape? 
[29:30]
 One.  It took 10 hours for one taping?  10 hours, one taping.  You go to a Rosie taping and it takes 61 minutes.  Doesn't matter.  For an hour show.  I know.  I guess keeping these kids in line.  Wow.  They didn't supply lunch.  No lunch.  Only snacks.  During each break, McAllister would step away from the kids.  My guess is that a few of them got on his nerves and smoked like a chimney.  I remember once or twice he snapped at some kid who was being annoying.  Other than doing his bit for the camera, he never seemed to be interested in the kids at all. 
[30:00]
 Maybe it might have been the pressure of an 8 or 10 hour long taping.  Wow.  Remember the big basement that they used to have the disc go in?  Of course.  It was the same studio.  All they did was aim the cameras in the other direction and pull out the four dancing platforms  and put some color lighting on.  You're wrecking it.  You're wrecking my childhood.  I'm flaring.  I've planned all this.  At the end of the show, the kids would get junk like Silly Putty, Lenders Bagels, Good  Humor Ice Cream and Curr House Hot Dog. 
[30:30]
 The kids said not many kids actually walked away with prizes.  Only a couple.  Then they'd have to usher the kids off because the 10 o'clock news had to be set up in the  same studio.  Wow.  They'd drive off.  Little memories from Wonderama.  I remember when I had Three Dog Night played.  I remember watching Three Dog Night.  It was so odd to see a rock band in there with the front row of kids, like three, four-year-olds 
[31:00]
 sometimes, looking like they were doing the pee-pee dance.  They were dancing around.  It was like, Jeremiah was a boop.  Then a little kid would come up and grab onto the bass player's leg and dance, do a little  kid pee-pee dance.  I would be like, get my agent on the phone.  I'm going to hit him with a ball peen hammer right over the head.  It's like, I used to be someone.  I used to be somebody.  Now I'm playing on Wonderama. 
[31:30]
 I'll take you out with a little more.  No, no, no, no more.  Hey, come on now.  Come on.  There it is.  Bob McAllister, Dead.  And now, a song for Bob McAllister on N.E.W. 
[32:00]

 Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob,  We didn't come up with any brand new childish bits today so we got to play the one from  yesterday when Brian Unger was doing his Charles Carrault thing.  How many people do you know could do a Charles Carrault impression?  Not many.  Not many.  You know when he was doing that Sunday morning program and at the end of the program he would  have the sounds of nature and stuff and he'd show a pond and ducks and stuff.  Yeah and it would go on forever. 
[38:00]
 It would go on forever, exactly.  Well Brian Unger from Comedy Central, he came up with this yesterday for us, check it out.  As we leave you on this Sunday morning, here's me taking a big poop.  Sometimes a poop is a good thing on a Sunday morning.  Some of you would like to share with your neighbors, your friends.  Here's me and the sounds of dumping. 
[38:30]
 Oftentimes we don't have time to show you the poop.  Today here's me taking a dump and then me showing it to you.  Oftentimes we like to leave our viewers with a little something from the outside.  Today it's me taking a poop.  Here's me running to the outhouse to take a big old Harry. 
[39:00]
 As we leave you on this Sunday morning, the sounds of pooping.  Because there's nothing better than a good poop. </pre>
