<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with a discussion about a list of banned songs from radio airplay, sparking debate over the reasons behind the exclusions of classic rock and pop tracks by artists like Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, Elton John, and Bob Dylan.  Callers contribute their own often-absurd justifications, including a caller’s misremembered William Shatner song. A caller, Barry, triggers a joke about George W. Bush and Bin Laden, further diverting the conversation.

The show then shifts to William Shatner's departure from Priceline commercials and the subsequent stock drop. Callers share their investment experiences, some reporting significant losses, with the hosts interjecting Star Trek jokes and humorous anecdotes.

Andrew Dice Clay calls in, initially expressing sympathy for 9/11 victims and proposing a 24-hour radio telethon. However, the conversation quickly turns humorous and off-color, with the hosts interjecting jokes despite Clay’s attempts to maintain a serious tone.  The discussion of the telethon, nicknamed the "Radio Thong" by Dice Clay, continues, fueled by sexual innuendo and crude humor targeting Jerry Lewis, Bill Cosby, and other celebrities.  A caller, Joe, disputes Clay's claim of originating the telethon idea. The segment includes a game, "What's in my Pants," featuring a female caller and studio guest Jamaican Mike, and numerous calls detailing sexual encounters involving Jamaican men. Jim Norton, expected as a guest, does not appear.

The show features a block of listener calls detailing explicit and often exaggerated sexual experiences in Jamaica, focusing on encounters with Jamaican men and their unusually large penises. Callers recount bizarre events, including an oral sex contest and a humiliating size comparison at an all-inclusive resort.  Other calls include photos of a wife with another woman and a large penis, a woman requesting Viagra, and a man avoiding Jamaica for Disneyland to prevent similar experiences.

The Jamaican call block transitions to a call about a bizarre bathroom injury leading to a lawsuit. This segues into a discussion about "Stalker Patty," a regular caller who sends Godiva chocolates and a personal note.  The show then mocks DJ "Rick" for attending a Loverboy concert with relentlessly offensive jokes about his perceived homosexuality.  The segment concludes with the "Win Stockbroker Dave's Money" contest, which involves a woman exposing her breasts in the studio for money, resulting in Dave’s abrupt departure and the segment's end.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  R.O.P.  And for me.  1027.  E.M.A.W. 
[00:00:30]  This is the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:01:00]  Thanks for checking us out today.  This is the type of music I need to hear on the radio now.  A lot of stations just toning it down, Anthony.  Toning it down.  Yeah.  They're bringing it down, you know, trying to be all nicey-nice.  We need some high-energy music.  Music to kick ass to.  We're all sad.  We get it.  We don't need to be sadder.  You know, music makes you do things.  I mean, Ozzy Osbourne made people commit suicide.  Right.  And we can't handle music.  The video's fine.  You can watch the videos all day, but don't listen to anything. 
[00:01:30]  This, I think, is inspiring.  It rallies you.  All right, Ant.  If you're just tuning in, there's a list going around by one of the big radio companies  telling their radio stations not to play the following songs.  And it's a really long list of tunes.  Because I guess hearing these songs would be offensive on the radio, right?  Yeah, they're trying to be nice.  You know, they don't want to upset people because of some of the titles and some of the lyrics 
[00:02:00]  of these songs.  Some of them, yeah, I could understand.  Other ones, it's like, what?  Why?  Yeah, so we're trying to figure out why for some of these.  Well, Kansas, Dust in the Wind.  That's pretty obvious, okay?  Led Zeppelin made the list with Stairway to Heaven.  And why?  Why?  A few Beatles songs made the list.  A Day in the Life.  Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.  Why Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds?  That's a song about LSD, isn't it? 
[00:02:30]  William Shatner's version, too?  William Shatner's.  I hate to think that.  Picture yourself in a boat on a river with tangerine trees and marmalade.  Guys, guys, guys.  Somebody calls you.  You answer quite slowly.  The girl with colitis goes, bye.  Bye, bye, bye, bye.  Barry wants in here.  Barry, what's up?  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, what's up?  You tell me.  Yeah, I wanted to know if Bon Jovi's One and Dead or Alive was on that list or not. 
[00:03:00]  Of course not.  No?  And Bush said that today.  He wants Bin Laden.  Dead or Alive.  Dead or Alive.  Fantastic.  Blown in.  Dead or Alive.  All right, Barry.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Was that Shatner that you put in there, Rick?  I thought it was.  I'd have liked to have heard a little bit of that.  Ahab the.  Ahab the Arab.  Yeah, I'm going to play a little.  The Arab.  I can't believe you guys know that song.  I had no idea.  Oh, my God.  Bob Dylan in Guns N' Roses doing Knocking on Heaven's Door.  That would be in bad taste, according to this list. 
[00:03:30]  Arthur Brown, fire.  I am the goddess of hell's.  I am the god of hell's fire, and I bring you fire.  Blue Oyster cult's burning for you.  That's the only.  Blue Oyster cult burning for you?  That's 50% of their playlist that gets on the radio.  And I don't think Don't Fear the Reaper's going to be either.  Going to be on there.  You're not able to be played either.  No, you're allowed to play Don't Fear the Reaper.  It's not on the list.  Maybe this isn't a complete list. 
[00:04:00]  Maybe they're adding to this list.  They probably are.  Let's hope.  Who could think of every song?  Paul McCartney and Wings, Live and Let Die.  Jimi Hendrix, Hey Joe.  Why Hey Joe?  Someone help me out with that one.  Where are you going with that gun in your hand?  Going to shoot his old lady.  What does that have to do with anything?  That's ridiculous.  Stephen Lynch, The Cabbie Song.  Yeah.  All right.  How about Jackson Brown, Doctor My Eyes? 
[00:04:30]  I don't know.  Seriously.  Someone who's a little better at music than us.  Help us.  Why Doctor My Eyes?  We still didn't cover the bangles.  Why is Walk Like an Egyptian?  A lot of people call and say just because we're not sure.  Egyptian.  Some of the hijackers were Egyptian.  Doctor My Eyes.  I guess the rule would be don't play anything by an artist with foreskin.  John Mellencamp, Crumbling Down and I'm on Fire.  U2, Sunday Bloody Sunday. 
[00:05:00]  Interesting.  That's a stretch.  Boston Smokin', Billy Joel, Only the Good Die Young.  Barry McGuire, Eve of Destruction.  Steam, Na Na Na Na, Hey Hey, Goodbye.  All right.  Really?  New York State of Mind on that by Billy Joel?  No.  Let's see.  I'm moving down here.  Zombie, She's Not There.  Elton John, Benny and the Jets, Danielle, and Rocket Man.  Thank God.  Three less Elton John songs we have to listen to.  Jerry Lee Lewis, Great Balls of Fire.  Santana, Evil Ways. 
[00:05:30]  Is Elton going to pull out his Candle in the Wind?  Goodbye Norma Jean, Candle in the Wind remake.  Why not?  It worked three times before this.  And write some other words to it.  He used that originally for Marilyn Monroe.  Then it was for the white kid, the...  Oh, oh.  Ryan.  Ryan White.  Ryan White.  Ryan White when that kid died of the age.  Age.  And then he pulled it out for Lady Di.  For Lady Di.  And now I'm sure...  He was in the news.  He said he will not fly on another American airliner company. 
[00:06:00]  That's good.  Because everyone was wondering how he'd get around.  Yeah.  Who cares, sissy boy?  Unless there's an armed guard on the plane.  All right.  Where are we, Elton John?  I just caught that.  Sissy.  When do you hear that anymore?  Nobody cares how that...  You sissy.  Do people really care how a rich Nancy is flying around?  Matt, what's up?  Hey, this is an old episode of WKRP in Cincinnati. 
[00:06:30]  Why?  Don't you remember that?  There was an episode where they had a list of songs they couldn't play.  Like some holy rollers took over the airwaves or something.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Booger.  Remember that?  Now, Opie, I think you're Dr. Johnny Fever now.  Thank you, sir.  Sure.  All right.  Is that why, Dr. My Eyes, because of all the eye wash needed by the medical and rescue people?  Wow.  Now that's a stress.  That is a stress. 
[00:07:00]  But hey, look at some of the...  We've seen the footage on TV where they're washing out everyone's eyes, but come on.  Well, maybe.  Let's see what else is on this list.  Did we say Louis Armstrong, What a Wonderful World?  Why is that?  I guess because it hasn't been the last week, and therefore that would be irony would bother people.  Right.  Okay.  What if they had horrific clips in between the lyrics?  That would be acceptable, because you can show the videos over and over, and people will watch.  Yeah, great.  Youngblood's Get Together.  Peter, Paul, and Mary, Blowing in the Wind and Leaving on a Jet Plane. 
[00:07:30]  Blowing in the Wind?  How many roads must a man walk?  I hate that folk crap.  Rolling Stones, Ruby Tuesday.  Simon and Garfunkel, Bridge Over Troubled Water.  What?  Why is that?  Carole King, I Feel the Earth Move, Anthony.  Jaeger and Evans.  Remember this song?  In the year 2525.  If man is still alive. 
[00:08:00]  If you guys are on Instant Feedback, help us out and tell us why for some of these songs.  Not the obvious ones.  Norman Greenbaum, Spirit in the Sky.  How about I've got a brand new pair of roller skates?  I don't know.  Is there anything not on this list?  These creeps?  It's like Footloose.  Let me go to Chris.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, guys, just wondering if the Insects song was on there.  You better watch out or the insects will get you.  Or the Muslims will get you. 
[00:08:30]  You better watch out or the insects will get you.  There you go.  You better watch out or the insects will get you.  Jim Norton, do you know what this is?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  And you shouldn't play it because it might remind people of the way everyone in Afghanistan  is acting right now.  Like retard.  That's actually a bunch of retarded children that they got together and they got a little  song and they were singing it, if you could call it. 
[00:09:00]  Let's go to John.  He knows why we shouldn't be playing Doctor of My Eyes.  Why can't I play Doctor of My Eyes by Jackson Brown?  John.  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  I just wanted to let you know, the chorus to that song is, is this the price for having  learned how not to fly?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, that would be the reason why Doctor of My Eyes wouldn't quite be apropos for this  moment.  Oh, interesting.  Look at you.  I didn't know that.  Okay.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Thank you.  Moving on with the list, Anthony. 
[00:09:30]  Songs that radio stations shouldn't play.  Hey, Cat Stevens, Peace Train and Mourning Has Broken.  Peace Train?  Why not Peace Train?  He's a Muslim.  Oh, well, any Cat Stevens.  I shouldn't play him because he is a dirty Muslim.  Wow.  Opie, I think you're lumping a lot of people into that category.  We just threw a billion people into a room.  I know.  Really?  There are some very law-abiding Muslim people in this city and around the country. 
[00:10:00]  Great.  You sit next to him on the train.  Let's make believe we're now a little paranoid right now.  I love them.  God.  Wow.  Okay.  We're going to have to work on that as a people.  Jen and Dean, Dead Man's Curve.  What's about a car?  The plane came in.  Oh, stop it, Rick.  Martha and the Vandellas and Van Halens dancing in the streets.  Why?  Because of that stupid clip, probably, of the Palestinians supposedly celebrating. 
[00:10:30]  See, my guess is a guess.  I don't think that much when I'm listening to the radio.  Me neither.  Holly's, he ain't heavy, he's my brother.  I heard a bunch of stations playing that over the weekend.  I can't imagine why that would be there.  Don McLean, American Pie.  Buddy Holly and the Crickets, that'll be the day.  Probably any Buddy Holly song would be bad.  Yeah, yeah.  Considering how he went.  There you go.  There it is.  John Lennon, Imagine, should not be played on the radio.  Bobby Darin, Mac the Knife. 
[00:11:00]  Because they used knives.  Because they used knives.  Holy ass.  Come on.  You sucked back.  Yep.  You're kidding, right?  I'm guessing that's the stupid rationale behind it.  The Clash.  Rock the Casbah.  The Safaris.  Wipeout.  Blood, Sweat and Tears and When I Die, which is a great song.  Tramps.  Disco Inferno.  Wow.  Paper Lace.  Remember that song, The Night Chicago Die? 
[00:11:30]  Awful.  Frank Sinatra, like you said, Anthony.  How about Afternoon Delight?  Did that make the list?  Afternoon Delight.  Afternoon Delight?  No.  Throwing sticks and stones together make a spark ignite, Opie.  One of the lyrics of Afternoon Delight.  As long as the theme from Alice didn't make it.  Because that's a song that has to be played.  I'm a new girl in town and she's looking good.  A fresh new face in the neighborhood is a new girl.  Shoot her.  Wouldn't you like to just drill your fist into Linda Lavin's teeth? 
[00:12:00]  Linda Lavin decided she was going to sing the theme song to Alice.  No.  Early to ride.  Early to bed.  The 15th cleaner went out of my head.  Shut up.  Although Vic Tabak was a genius.  Wow.  I can't stand that, Linda Lavin.  Nice.  And she's like, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Yeah.  They bring it on down just before the show.  Bring it on down, Alice. 
[00:12:30]  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  What is that?  Hold on, hold on.  Do we have the song?  Yeah, I'll take care of you.  Let me hear it.  Early to ride.  Right.  It's your silence.  Early to bed.  And in between I cooked and cleaned it.  Right on my head.  Going through life with blinders on it, tough to see.  I'm playing my band blue.  I had to get up, get up from under and look for me. 
[00:13:00]  There's a blue, darling.  How on and see.  Here she goes.  Looking down.  There's a fresh, freckled face.  In the honey.  What's this?  Who's the girl in town?  With a brand new crowd.  She was just passing through.  My favorite part.  Bring it down, Linda.  Bring it down. 
[00:13:30]  That's awful.  Tim, you're next on the Opinality Show.  Oh, God.  And my whole attitude toward you has changed since you know the lyrics to Afternoon Delight,  but we'll move on.  Two things.  One, I think, Dr. My Eyes, at the very end, it makes reference to smoke of a distant fire.  Oh, brother.  I mean, they're stretching it.  But, Ant, you're a fake.  Guys, keep up the good work. 
[00:14:00]  All right.  Take care.  Thank you.  Let's move on here, Anthony.  More songs that radio stations shouldn't be playing, according to this list here.  Where were we?  Frank Sinatra.  CCR, Traveling Band.  The Gap Band.  You dropped a bomb on me.  Well, yeah.  Why can't the Traveling Band song?  I don't know.  Someone's got to help us with some of these songs.  I don't get it.  I don't know.  Alien and Farm, Smooth Criminal.  Did we figure out why for that one yet?  Just because of the...  Criminal.  The Door's the End. 
[00:14:30]  Third Eye Blind, Jumper.  Neil Diamond, America.  They come into America.  I think that's because it might offend people,  because it's about, you know,  everybody, come on in.  Come on in.  Give us your huddled masses of crap.  Come on in.  Come on in.  Come on in and poop on our faces.  Come on in.  Learn how to fly and kill us.  They come into America today.  Shut up.  Nice comb over, Tool.  I saw him on TV. 
[00:15:00]  He really has awful hair.  Love on the rocks.  Oh.  Do you know what...  How many bad songs do you know?  September morn.  We danced until the night became a brand new day.  I know that one because I was writing a song parody about it a while ago.  Internet porn.  I spanked it till the night became a brand new day.  Internet porn.  Come on.  That would have been a good one. 
[00:15:30]  My brother then suggested I should do it to the Patty Duke theme,  and then we...  Yeah.  Earl, comment?  CCR, traveling band.  There's a line that says...  747 coming out of the sky.  747 coming out of the sky.  There's a line.  Someone got excited and called the state militia.  I think the 747 line is pretty much it.  Okay.  Well, we're learning.  You know, I don't listen to the lyrics that closely.  What happened here, do I?  Checking out my classic rock.  Thank God somebody...  Hello again.  Hello.  Sorry.  Just called to let you know. 
[00:16:00]  All right.  Enough with the Neil Diamond.  Lenny Kravitz.  What?  You don't like that big, poofy comb over and the sprayed black hair?  Awful.  You don't sing me love songs.  Did he do the somebody left a cake out in the rain?  No, that was...  Wayne Newton.  Did Wayne Newton do that one?  He does sing it.  He closes with it.  Sweet Caroline.  Yes.  That's a good song, actually.  That's a fine number.  It's a fine number. 
[00:16:30]  It's a fine number.  Yes.  By a grand combo.  All right.  Ah, let's see.  Lenny Kravitz fly away.  Tom Petty free falling.  Bruce Springsteen...  Because I'm free!  Oh, sorry.  Bruce Springsteen, I'm on fire and going down.  Phil Collins in the air tonight?  Wow.  Yeah, well, come on.  It's in the atmosphere of...  Yeah, it's kind of bad.  Bad things, I'm guessing.  Alice in Chains.  Lots of Alice in Chains made the list.  Really?  Including Rooster. 
[00:17:00]  Sea of Sorrow.  Yeah, they come to snuff the rooster.  Yeah, yeah.  Here come the rooster.  Walking tall machine gun man.  They spit on me in my homeland.  You don't bring me flowers.  Please do one more version of Sweet Caroline.  Just one more verse.  Good times never been so good.  Nice.  Walk like an Egyptian. 
[00:17:30]  Wow.  Wow.  All right.  Rooster, Sea of Sorrow.  Alice in Chains, Down in a Hole.  And Them Bones.  But they write on the list, it's Them Bone.  Them Bone.  Them Bone.  Beastie Boys.  Them Bones again.  Them Bones.  Beastie Boys made the list with Sure Shot and Sabotage.  The Cult.  Shouldn't Play Fire Woman.  Everclear.  Santa Monica.  I do not.  Wow.  No clue on that one.  Yeah, that doesn't make any sense. 
[00:18:00]  Filter.  Hey, man.  Nice shot.  Foo Fighters.  Learn to Fly.  Corn.  Falling away from me.  Yeah.  Red Hot Chili Peppers.  Aeroplane.  And Under the Bridge.  Under the Bridge?  Are any of these coming through?  Under the Bridge.  Supposedly, the only connection I can make, they supposedly found explosives under the  GW.  Oh, my God.  That's the only thing I can think of.  It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there.  It's hard to believe.  Under the Bridge downtown. 
[00:18:30]  Hello again.  Hello.  Smashing Pumpkins.  Bullet with Butterfly Wings.  Limp Bizkit.  Break stuff.  Green Day.  Brain Stew.  Really?  Wow.  Temple of the Dog.  Say Hello to Heaven.  Sugar Ray Fly.  Local H.  Bound for the Floor.  Wow.  Slipknot.  Left Behind.  Wait and Bleed.  Oh, hello.  Speed Kills.  The latest one from Bush. 
[00:19:00]  Shouldn't be played.  311 Down.  STP.  Big Bang Baby.  And Dead and Bloated.  Soundgarden.  Fell on Black Days.  Black Hole Sun.  And remember that song from Nina?  Which one?  99 Red Bull.  It's Nina.  Nina.  Nina.  99 Luftballon.  The big rumor she died of a heroin overdose.  Right.  I don't even know if she did or not.  Is she alive?  Does anyone care?  I do.  Why?  Floating in the summer sky. 
[00:19:30]  Love on the rocks.  I'm TNT.  I'm dynamite.  Hello again.  Hello.  Just call to another one.  Bites the duster.  Dun, dun, dun.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Neil Diamond covering all those songs today.  All right.  For some apparent reason.  That list is on foundrymusic.com, by the way.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  All right. 
[00:20:00]  Raw it out.  We'll take a quick break and more of your phone calls.  Opie and Anthony.  Is this the best radio you guys could come up with?  1027 WNEW.  Could VH1 stop running the Motley Crue behind the music?  Yeah.  How many times?  Oh, my God.  Please.  Is this the...  Yeah.  Okay. 
[00:20:30]  Okay.  Come in.  Come in.  Virgil.  Virgil.  Come in.  Come in.  Come in.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Did I see what, Anthony?  I'm sorry.  Henry Rollins doing his spoken word thing on Comedy Central. 
[00:21:00]  Was it good?  It was pretty funny, man.  I got a good funny guy.  I got one of his spoken word albums.  It's pretty good.  He's talking about the Thai sex shops and stuff that he went into to see a sex show.  And, like, he argued with the rest of his band that he really didn't want to go to this thing.  And it was kind of, you know, a bad thing to even happen.  But his bandmates really wanted to go.  And they were pressuring him and saying that, you know, it'll give you a great material.  So he figures, what the hell?  I'm going to go.  I'll just sit there and watch and, you know, give me something to talk about.  And he's sitting there and he goes, and then I look over the other side and I see somebody looking at me. 
[00:21:30]  And he's mouthing out, hey, that's Henry Rollins at the sex show.  It's really good if you get a chance to see it.  Well, you will because I think it's played 800 times on Comedy Central, like everything else.  TV just sucks.  Yeah.  VH1, they have like four or five shows.  They just keep rerunning.  They rerun over and over and over and over again.  MTV, if they show the goddamn testicle surgery from Tom Green. 
[00:22:00]  Tom Green.  Wow.  How did I forget that name?  I need a shot.  Tom Green.  It's like, I don't want to see that.  It makes me nauseous.  It makes me queasy.  I'm surprised you were able to see Tom Green this weekend.  Road Rules Marathon over and over and over and over again.  Yeah.  They got five shows.  Huh.  Ponderous.  Effing ponderous.  Ponderous.  That's why I go to the Hitler channel.  All right.  Now, another Mike saying we're hypocrites, Anthony.  All right.  Mike, you're next on WNEW.  Yeah, you guys plugged, you know, Girls, Girls, Girls on your commercial, and now you're 
[00:22:30]  ripping on the crew.  Who plugged?  You have a commercial where you have the background of Girls, Girls, Girls.  We have no...  What does that mean?  It's a music show.  So?  Oh, it's a music show.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Yeah, that song rocked.  It rocked Friday night.  We're talking about C&M Live and a music bed that we play for our show.  That's two different things.  Or are you talking about a commercial that we had for the show?  Why?  You're ripping on the crew with Girls, Girls, Girls. 
[00:23:00]  Is it that?  Hold on a minute.  Is it this?  Behind the Genius.  Yeah, all right.  No one will deny the fact that Girls, Girls, Girls rocked.  They rocked, and the crew rocked Friday night.  I'm not saying that Motley Crue sucks in the band.  There's still a lot of their stuff I like hearing, but it sounds like it wasn't the  greatest show this weekend.  The chick was good.  All right.  All right, cool.  They don't get it.  Thank you.  All right. 
[00:23:30]  The fans, of course, are going to be a huge crew fan.  Don't worry.  If I'm a huge Motley Crue fan, and Tommy Lee's not behind the drum kit, I'm a little  bummed when I walk into the arena.  Yeah.  Exactly.  He's a big part of the band.  A lot of the flash, a lot of the show, the drum kit levitating and flying over the audience,  you know.  I'm just saying it's not the crew of the 80s.  Speaking of a band that's moving on without their main component.  Yeah.  Did you see Styx behind the music? 
[00:24:00]  Oh, did you see it, Bill?  It was one of the better ones, man.  Dennis D. Young and Tommy Shaw just flat out hate each other.  Hate each other.  They keep trying, they keep getting back together for short periods of time and then realize  they're completely different people and hate each other.  But Styx has decided to continue on because they've had some recent success because Cartman  was singing Come Sail Away on South Park and all that.  So they're torn again.  Are you on that?  Because of that?  Yeah.  It's amazing what brings some of the, it's amazing what brings some of these bands back 
[00:24:30]  into popularity.  Yeah.  They said one of the reasons why they're popular again is because of South Park doing  Come Sail Away, Cartman doing it.  Wow.  So they go and they have a band meeting and they're like, hey, Dennis D. Young, you know,  we want to get back together, you know, make some bucks, you know, go on tour.  And Dennis has some kind of, what is his problem?  He's, he's got some medical thing where he's sensitive to light.  So he needed some time.  A vampire.  What is that? 
[00:25:00]  He needed some time.  He couldn't go back on tour right away.  And the band's like, you know what?  Screw you.  And they went on without him with a brand new singer.  Great.  I always thought that guy was a little light in his loafers anyway.  They showed his wife on behind the music.  I would have swore that the guy was gay.  Yeah.  The funny thing is they showed like early footage of Styx.  And the guy, as far as, you know, as far as the time goes, was kind of, he looked the  part of a rock star in a way.  And we're talking about the, you know, the mid seventies, late seventies, whatever.  And then as time went on, he, he faded into like, uh, uh, Liberace. 
[00:25:30]  Right.  Exactly.  He went from like this guy.  Hairy land.  Yeah.  He went from a guy that looked like he fit in in the, in the seventies to looking like  Liberace within like five or six years.  Sticks behind the music thing.  You got to check it out.  I'm sure I'll be able to see that too.  It's pretty entertaining.  Frampton behind the music.  I saw that one.  That was pretty sad.  Nothing, nothing groundbreaking there, you know?  Wait, I want to hear it.  I want to hear a taste of this. 
[00:26:00]  Is that Cartman?  Yeah.  Singing it?  Yeah, listen to this.  Cartman.  I'm standing awake.  Great.  Set an open card for the virgin scene.  Cause I've got to be free. 
[00:26:30]  Free to face the light.  Get ahead of me.  Wait till it rocks.  It's funny as hell.  I'm burned in the kitchen.  I'm burned in the kitchen.  So claim it free.  We're searched for to marry.  On every ship.  But we're here.  A load of tricks.  Take care. 
[00:27:00]  Take care.  It becomes a mess when it kicks in.  Listen to this.  I look to the sea.  Reflections in the waves.  Spark my memory.  Sounds like it hurts. 
[00:27:30]  I think of childhood friends.  And the dreams we had.  We live happily forever.  It says the story goes.  But somehow we miss out.  On the part of the girl.  How we try.  Best of all we can. 
[00:28:00]  To carry.  To carry.  Come toел.  To play.  To protect me. 
[00:28:30]  Come to were.  Come to you.  Come to you.  Come to be.  Yes. 
[00:29:00]  I'm so mad.  I'm so mad.  I'm so mad.  I'm so mad.  I'm so mad.  I'm so mad.  I'm so mad.  I'm so mad.  I thought that they were angels. 
[00:29:30]  But you made a pet.  The cland obtain force is starting  And hell is force I got it  Come sail away, Come sail away  Come sail away with me  You got you extends your confidence  Come sail away, Come sail away with me 
[00:30:00]  We are walking out.  Hey!  We are going down.  Hey!  What's going on?  You can't feel like you are going to be right now.  You can't feel like you are going to be right now.  You can't feel like you are going down.  Right now.  Right now.  Don't get away.  Don't get away.  Stay away with me. 
[00:30:30]  Be quiet, huh?  Be quiet, huh? 
[00:31:00]  Be quiet, huh?  Be quiet, huh?  Okay.  That's great.  Goddamn.  That's pretty funny, man.  But yeah, because that song sticks on tour again.  Right.  What an excuse.  Yeah.  A newfound popularity, Anthony.  Correct.  Going on without Dennis DeYoung, who's too busy being Liberace.  Someone's writing Sensitive to Light, also known as AIDS.  That's horrible. 
[00:31:30]  That's the reason he gave why he couldn't go back on tour.  I mean, don't you perform in the dark with some stage lights for the most part, you know?  Yeah.  Whatever.  He's a puss.  Alright, we gotta take a quick break.  Opie.  You scum.  And Anthony.  Your new name is Dick.  Opie and Anthony.  What changed you into such demonic little bastards?  One, oh, two, seven.  Pickles.  WNEW.  So, Anthony, let's quickly talk about this Priceline thing. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  Shatner boldly goes forth from Priceline.  Yeah.  Uh, Captain Kirk has blasted off.  Captain Kirk.  They call him Captain Kirk.  My God, it was 30 mother effing years ago.  Why am I still Captain Kirk?  The sound follows me everywhere.  Bridge.  Why is there a teletype on a spaceship?  Did you hear that?  What the hell was that? 
[00:32:30]  Do you think he has a retarded Laverne Shirley following him wherever he goes?  Yes.  F-cards.  We are going to beam down to the planet F-cards.  F-card seven.  Oh, there's the door.  Bridge.  Ah, bridge.  Bridge.  Why does someone always get on and hit sickbay?  It's one slide up.  Take the goddamn stairs.  You can see Kirk do that.  The doors are shut and he's like, oh, sorry, I went to hit the button and open the door. 
[00:33:00]  Like we do downstairs.  I'm all pissed off.  All right.  Star Trek star William Shatner and the ailing name your price.  E-tailers have parted company sources.  No, no, no.  But who's leaving whom depends on which party you ask, Anthony.  I'm leaving.  On a jet plane.  Don't.  No.  When I'll be back again.  I'm beaming out of Priceline. 
[00:33:30]  My God.  Where am I going?  It's going to come through the roof of the Enterprise like Willy Mother effing Wonka.  Oh.  God, these rooms are loud.  This is the bathroom.  Where's the goddamn toilet?  Now, he dumped a lot of cash.  Yeah.  The article says Shatner is said to be miffed that he's had a paper loss of millions on his Priceline stock.  Yes.  Which the online company used as currency to pay for his crooner spoof commercials. 
[00:34:00]  Glut loops.  So instead of taking a salary, he decided to take some stock, Ant.  Glut loops.  Which in a lot of cases is a smart move.  Glut loops.  Right.  Some Wall Street analysts say Shatner may not want his name associated with the losing company anymore.  Yeah.  And that's why he left.  It's stock has plummeted from a high of $165 per share last year into a black hole of just $2.25 a share.  Nice. 
[00:34:30]  Space reference, jackass.  Black hole.  How many quat loops would A-Rod be earning on your earth for your baseball game?  Oh, wait, it's my earth too.  What a dope.  It lost billions for its investors, Priceline.  Billions.  And Shatner saw his stake, listen to this, saw his stake evaporate from $20.6 million to a poultry $202,000. 
[00:35:00]  I felt the same way when I saw Spock dying in the reactor room in the rapid gun.  Nothing I could do about it, yet he just faded away.  What sunk faster, the stock or my wife in that pool?  I'd say Priceline stock.  Oh, ring the bell.  They're just equally as dead.  Okay, ring the bell on me, William Shatner. 
[00:35:30]  At least when we brought her up, there was hope.  Wow.  She had a pulse for maybe a minute.  Well, that happened.  I lost millions.  Millions.  Millions.  Alex, what's going on?  Yeah, I lost all my money in that thing.  Yeah.  In Priceline? 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, I was at that party, the millionaire party.  Oh, you were at the millionaire party?  Come on, you are?  Yeah.  We hated all you guys.  We're looking from the stage going, look at these bastards.  They're all millionaires.  Now, you weren't able to dump your shares until a certain amount of time.  Was that it?  Well, listen to this one.  I sold part of it off, and I bought myself a car, and I got my girlfriend a breast implant.  Stop.  Swear to God.  Yeah.  And she left me.  Uh-oh.  Red alert, Mark.  She left you. 
[00:36:30]  She left me.  She left me.  When I lost it all, she left me.  So I got nothing.  No girl, no money.  You'll get nothing and like it.  You got it.  Uh-oh.  NASDAQ alert.  I hear in the background.  The price, the price line is plummeting.  Maybe we could all get together.  What?  Uh-oh.  Klingon ship.  Maybe we could all get together, and Spock could figure out how to slingshot the Enterprise 
[00:37:00]  around the sun.  Sending us back in time when price line was back at $150.  Then we'll punch up.  KON!  Klingon bastards killed my stock.  Let's go to John.  John, what's going on?  How you doing, guys?  All right.  So, you want some dirt on price line?  Uh, why?  You used to work there?  Yeah, I used to be up there in the teens.  Were you a millionaire?  I was at one point. 
[00:37:30]  These are like the quickest millionaires.  You guys gotta understand it, and I was on that stage.  These guys were, I've never seen a group of people happier in all my life.  They all had tuxedos on, and nice gowns.  The women, we're just walking around a couple of times.  Black tie.  We look like losers.  Well, we are losers.  They're drinking the expensive champagne, and they were, you could just see how happy  they were.  Actually, I believe it was Saurian branding.  So, John, you were a millionaire for a little while?  I was a millionaire for about two months. 
[00:38:00]  And then what happened?  Uh, after I got to about $80 a share, I sold all my options.  How many did you have?  Uh, a little over $10,000.  All right.  Well, so you did all right.  You made out, okay.  Yeah, I was smart.  A lot of people, man, they just didn't know when to get out, like Rick.  What's worse, the Romulans or capital gains taxes?  Uh, capital gains taxes.  I'd say capital gains taxes.  You got it.  And just to let you know, Shatner did get cash, too.  Plus option. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, I assumed he did.  I assumed he did.  Yeah.  Damn it, Jim, I'm a doctor, not an investor.  You got it.  Can't do the voice, by the way.  At least I didn't invest in that Asian internet company.  Shut up.  Try calling the main number now.  It didn't even work.  All right, John.  At least I wasn't stupid enough to go to that Asian internet company.  God.  71 cents a share.  Who saw that one?  Uh...  Shut up, Rick.  Scotty, get me some PCCLF. 
[00:39:00]  Working.  Computer.  Get me E-Trade.  Rick, when did you get Priceline?  Working.  At what price did he get Priceline?  50, right?  55.  55 bucks a share.  And he's still in.  No, I sold, dude.  It's down to...  When did you sell?  Recently?  I sold about a month ago.  At what?  At probably five.  Four or five.  Oh, sorry, dude, that you sold at four instead of two and a half. 
[00:39:30]  Sorry.  Woo!  Mr. Priceline, man.  Mr. Priceline, the man.  Picture yourself in a company that's tanking.  My stock's going down.  Down.  Down.  Down.  What is that goddamn song?  Suddenly, someone is there at the brokerage firm.  The man that tells you you're broke. 
[00:40:00]  Face is unstunned.  Hey, Greg, what's going on?  One, what's up?  You guys suck.  Thank you.  Hey, I'm pissed because I can't eat anymore.  Why?  Priceline was awesome.  What do you mean?  You know how you could get all your deals with food and stuff?  Yeah.  You really would pay half off your entire food bill.  Well, they discontinued their Priceline for groceries a while ago.  I know.  Thank you a lot, guys.  I'm so pissed. 
[00:40:30]  I told you it was going to be big.  The losses are really big.  All right, Greg.  Thank you.  Here he comes.  William Shatner.  Yeah.  Nice one.  Lucy is the sky with diamonds.  Priceline.  Lucy is the sky with diamonds.  Lucy is the sky with diamonds.  Here's the sound of me when I realize how much I lost in the market.  Ah!  I don't buy it!  Picture yourself in a boat on a river with tangerine trees and marmalade skies. 
[00:41:00]  Somebody calls you.  You answer quite slowly.  Ha, ha, ha.  A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.  She's the sky.  Cellophane flowers.  Of yellow and green. 
[00:41:30]  Oh.  Howling over your hair.  Ha, ha, ha.  What a soul.  Or the girl with a sun in her eyes.  And she's gone!  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  I love the bad echo.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Lucy and the sky.  Yes.  Yes.  Ah, Tim.  What's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  I used to work for a supermarket as a cashier.  I remember one day I come into work and it says,  pipeline has been discontinued.  And all this, I knew it was a downfall from then on, man.  Ah.  Yeah. 
[00:42:00]  I feel bad.  Yeah, I know, man.  All right, Tim.  To a bridge by a fountain.  The rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.  Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers that grow so incredibly high.  Newspaper taxis appear on the shore.  It's waiting to take you away.  Climb in the back with your head in the crowd.  Echo, echo.  Go, go, go, go.  He passed me.  Mike, what's going on? 
[00:42:30]  How are you doing, guys?  All right.  I had 2,000 shares of that stock.  Yeah.  And I'm about to commit 2,000 right now.  When did you get in?  When it first came out, my broker told me about it.  And he advised me to buy it.  Of course.  It was looking glass time.  Wow.  How much did you lose?  A lot.  A lot of money.  All right.  How you doing, Mike?  But whatever, Ben. 
[00:43:00]  Whatever, Ben.  Whatever, Ben.  Whatever, Ben.  Admiral Kirk.  Lucy in the sky with diamond.  Lucy in the sky with diamond.  Priceline stock is best served cold.  And it's very cold in space, Admiral Kirk.  My God, God.  Lighten up.  I just lost an egent junk. 
[00:43:30]  Ha ha ha.  Google.  Can't, could you cut me some slime?  I've got an idea.  I'm taking all my...  I'm taking all my Priceline chairs, putting them in a photon torpedo and shooting them toward the Genesis planet.  It gave Spots life.  Life from Dad.  I feel good.  I feel young.  It's about time to get out.  I feel young again.  What was he waiting for to get out? 
[00:44:00]  I don't know.  Everyone thought it was going through the roof.  Everyone thought it was going back?  $200.  Name your prize for a ride on the Enterprise.  Coming up.  Who wouldn't pay for that?  Poor bastard.  Now he's got to really be better.  That was his gravy train.  What's he going to do?  Go back to game shows?  They're saying he's in a movie or something.  What?  Yeah.  Why did they kill me off?  They killed me off in the last Star Trek movie. 
[00:44:30]  God damn it.  I'm done for.  All right.  We've got to take a quick break.  We'll be back.  212-757-1027.  O.B.  Anthony.  WNEW.  I just needed someone to talk to.  You were just too busy with yourself.  You were never there for me.  You were just too busy with yourself.  I just stopped it now. 
[00:45:00]  Now I'm older and I feel like I couldn't let some of this anger pain.  But it's the only thing that I am crashing is the best that I have been.  And we're back with the O.B.  We and Anthony's show.  Thanks for checking us out.  Our buddy's on the line.  We haven't talked to him on the radio since we got syndicated, Anthony. 
[00:45:30]  Yes, this is the first exposure of Andrew Dice Clay to the national market.  Andrew Dice Clay.  Hello?  It's the Dice Man.  Dice.  Talk up.  I can't hear you.  You can't hear us?  Really?  Yeah, it's hard to hear you.  No one else is having a problem today.  Cleveland is.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, I heard about that.  All right.  Can you hear us now?  Yeah, I can hear you pretty good.  All right.  What's up?  Yeah.  How are you guys doing?  Pretty good.  All right.  You know, things going on. 
[00:46:00]  No, I know.  And I actually wish I was calling under better circumstances.  Yeah.  You know?  And, you know, the first thing I have to say is, I mean, we all know what an awful tragedy  this is and how horrible it is.  And I personally want to say how my heart goes out to all the families and the firemen  and the policemen that have lost people. 
[00:46:30]  You know, it's just a terrible thing.  Inconceivable, this whole thing.  It is inconceivable.  But what you have to remember is that, you know, this country has been built on such a  strong foundation, you know, and when you have a strong foundation like we have, you  could really carry a lot on your shoulders.  And even though this is an awful thing, I mean, everybody is going to do their job. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, yeah.  I mean, just like the firemen have been doing and the police and obviously New York has the  greatest mayor in the history of New York.  Giuliani's done a great job.  He's shown leadership.  Yeah, certainly shown.  Amazing.  I mean, these people are heroes.  They're courageous.  I mean, just all the volunteers, everybody wants to be part of this.  And Dice, don't forget about the dogs.  The who? 
[00:47:30]  The dogs down there.  Yeah, and all the dogs.  Well, no, I'm serious.  No, you know.  What do you mean the dogs?  There's dogs down there.  They got the dogs down there.  They're trying to search for people.  You know, the rescue dogs.  They, you know, they have that thing under their neck, you know.  All right.  Well, the dogs don't understand English, so they don't see what I'm trying to say.  What?  Dice.  What?  Are you wearing a big leather jacket with the American flag studs on the back?  Yeah, I got my American flag jacket.  You got that one? 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  I always liked that one.  Yeah.  You know, I just want to get this across to you.  Okay.  You know, because, you know, I'm listening to it.  We're not making any jokes.  Seriously.  There's a lot of dogs down there, and a lot of people are pissed off that the dogs aren't getting, you know, the attention.  Oh, so you're not kidding me.  No.  Well, feed the dogs.  Well, they didn't have dog food, so then they put word out on the radio, and they started collecting dog food for the dogs, and then they needed a little, little what, Anthony? 
[00:48:30]  A scorch fund.  They needed, like, dog booties, and we got them that, too, because they were calling around in the rubble, cutting their little paws.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.  Yeah, but, you know.  Thanks for kidding.  We're not kidding.  I know.  You're goofing on me.  You know, I'm trying to call in.  Dice.  And be serious about something.  I'm getting ready to hit somebody in the face with a pipe.  Dice, calm down.  You know what I mean?  Dice, calm down.  First of all, we're not kidding with you.  That's just one of the things that's going on.  But you know what?  Even if you are kidding, I think that's important, because I think at this point, you know, everybody, you know, besides, you know, all the volunteers and firemen and police have to do their job. 
[00:49:00]  And if you guys are kidding, that's okay, because that's what your job is.  And I think your job is also to lift and help, you know, lift the spirits of the city and the country.  Right.  You know, and one of the reasons I'm calling in is because I would like to do a thing with you guys, which is, you know, I hope we could do this, which would be a radio telethon, a 24-hour radio telethon. 
[00:49:30]  24 hours?  24 hours where we get all kinds of entertainment, not just comedians, rock stars, performers that'll talk, maybe politicians, and raise all this money to give to these families and the police and everybody that needs it immediately. 
[00:50:00]  This is a We Are New York emergency telethon.  And, you know, I would like everybody involved in this.  And, of course, I want to do this with you guys.  And, you know, even thinking about it, you know, and I hope I'm not going over the line here.  You know, I know in the past I have had problems with Howard Stern.  You guys have had problems with him.  But I have no more problems with him.  Oh, yeah?  Because all the nonsense that we do all year long, all the petty nonsense goes right out the window now. 
[00:50:30]  Everybody is friends.  This is the time that I feel that everybody has to get together and unite because that's what we are.  You know, this is the United States.  This is, you know, the greatest country in the world.  And even though this thing happened in New York and in Washington, we are all connected.  And that's what makes us the United States. 
[00:51:00]  And this thing that happened, in my opinion, in the greatest city and the greatest country in the world, you know, has to be taken care of.  You know, and I don't like when I hear people saying, you know, we were a great country.  Let me tell you something.  We were, we are, and always will be the greatest country ever.  You know, and, you know, I just want to say this, and then we can talk about whatever you want.  Because, you know, I mean, you know what happened is awful. 
[00:51:30]  And it's something that, you know, we never thought would happen to us.  But it did.  And it hurts.  And, you know, and people can't make sense of it.  And that was the intentions of these animals that did this.  To knock us down and keep us down.  Right.  But let me tell you something.  That could never happen.  Because New Yorkers, whether you're from the boroughs or New York City or upstate New York, have the spirit and more heart than all of these third world garbage countries put together anywhere. 
[00:52:00]  Amen.  This whole country of ours will now bond together.  And I think we'll rise to the occasion.  Guys, it took you a week for the speech?  No, I'm just trying to talk from my heart.  You know, I'm going to smack you in the mouth in a second.  Let me tell you something.  We were in here on Tuesday and Wednesday last week.  And a lot of the same sentiments coming from a lot of people.  And now you're calling. 
[00:52:30]  It's over a week later.  And now you've got the RR.  I took you the call when I knew you would be on the air and a lot of people would be listening.  All right.  And I knew that the day or two after, there wouldn't be that many people listening.  Right.  You know.  I mean, but you know what?  I, you know, I am from that city.  You know that.  I'm from Brooklyn.  And, and stop playing the music.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  You got to stop playing the music, really.  I'm going to get mad. 
[00:53:00]  I think it's a nice background.  You know.  Well, I'm having a hard time thinking when you do this.  Nice.  It's the national anthem.  Yeah, we're feeling it right now.  Come on.  I'm just trying to say something.  This is the one time I'm calling in, you know, serious, and you're jerking me around here.  No.  Well, you know, I liked what you were saying, so we figured a nice background music for it.  All right.  Well, shut it off.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Anthony with the buttons.  I don't have a button.  I'm not playing this. 
[00:53:30]  What do you want?  What do I got to give you?  Jokes?  No.  I'm not going to go into that now.  I liked what you were saying.  Continue talking about the filthy animals.  All right.  Why can't they teach driver's ed in sex ed in that third world country?  It's too hard on the camel.  I mean, what kind of jokes?  There you go.  What do you call a chink and a jap driving around in a Trans Am?  The gooks are hazard.  You know what I mean?  What do you want?  What's better than ten fingers on a piano?  Two lips around my organ.  We're not doing jokes today. 
[00:54:00]  You know what I mean?  Oh, I like that.  No.  I'm just trying to talk about this thing.  I'm hanging up.  No.  I'm hanging up.  I want to talk about this telephone.  Don't hang up.  All right.  Now, you're going to be like...  You know what?  You think it's a big joke.  Yeah.  No.  But you got all these kids out there.  I'm not talking.  I'm hanging up.  No.  Dice.  Don't hang up.  I'm hanging up.  You're getting me mad.  It's almost over. 
[00:54:30]  You can't cut it off in the middle.  It's the National Anthem.  So it's almost done.  Listen to this note.  This is from the Chicago Yankee game last night where Mrs. Butterworth got up and sang  that great version of the National Anthem.  There we go.  All right, Dice.  You know something?  You guys are morons no matter what.  Well, I'll stop it.  You're just morons.  Stop it.  We thought it was appropriate.  You know I always call in as a dummy and I do stupid stuff.  I'm trying to say something.  No, we don't say that to your face. 
[00:55:00]  Never.  Let me ask you something.  Neither of you guys got kids yet?  Dice, you're being very patriotic and we just thought...  Do any of you guys have kids yet?  To date?  Oh!  You know what?  You know what?  It's good that you're doing this.  You're making me lose, too, because you know what?  All right, come on.  I've got to be honest.  I was a little uptight about calling in because I wanted to, you know, say something really  good.  Yeah.  Until you wrecked it.  No, no.  We didn't wreck anything. 
[00:55:30]  I'm just making a point.  I think you made a great point.  Hold on.  Let's regroup.  Okay.  All right.  No, we're okay.  We didn't wreck anything.  This radiothon sounds like a great idea.  What Anthony and I have been going for the last few days is a few chuckles.  So that was a little chuckle.  No, no.  And that's all right.  Just to leave a little steam, a little tension.  That's why I gave you the chink joke.  All right.  Well, we were hoping it would, you know, make someone chuckle.  You know, you started in with the dogs.  You know what I mean?  Hold on.  Hold on.  That's true.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[00:56:00]  Where do you find a dog with no legs?  Hold on.  Right where you left them.  I mean, you want dog jokes.  Wait.  I'm putting you on with Melissa for a second because you have to believe this.  Melissa?  Hi.  Hi.  Andrew Dice Clay's on the line live from L.A.  I was, I volunteered Friday night at the Armory for about four hours.  And one of the things that we're requesting that people send in is dog food and the booties.  So that the dogs have stuff.  They're not BSing you.  They're telling you the truth.  All right.  Well, you know what? 
[00:56:30]  If there's no dog food around, give them regular food.  Yeah.  You can't give the dogs regular food.  Yes, you can.  I got a dog.  He eats prime rib every day.  Yeah, well, that's some dogs.  You can't give all dogs.  And another thing.  All dogs can eat regular food.  You just don't want them to eat regular food because it's more expensive.  No.  I just don't like giving my dog regular food.  And when dogs are being dysphoric and trying to help out, you know what?  You throw them a steak.  Right.  Who's looking?  All right.  Well, anyway.  All right.  Well, anyway.  Owen, you're right. 
[00:57:00]  And I just want to say to Owen, thank you very much.  Because one of my, my company was in one of the buildings.  I've got his hair.  Okay.  There she goes.  I think with the mom.  Melissa, you're breaking out.  So I'm going to let you go.  All right.  Dice, enough with the chuckles.  So who's Melissa?  I mean, what am I even talking?  Was she good to go?  No, she's a listener.  All right.  It's funny.  You really don't believe us on the dog thing.  We have a, we have a.  She sounded out.  I think you're playing with me.  We have a radio friend.  I got a dose of kiwi cream for her.  We have a radio friend up in, where is Scorch?  Utica, Syracuse? 
[00:57:30]  We never know where he's broadcast from.  And he's.  I just called in because I think we should put this telethon together.  It's a radiothon.  Right.  Yeah, a radiothon.  All right.  Telethon is television.  I just think, you know, we need to encourage each other at this point.  Right.  You know, and help each other.  And, you know, even more important than, you know, what we're doing now, you know, the future of these children that have lost loved ones, you know, 
[00:58:00]  are going to have to, you know, live with this.  And by us doing this kind of telethon, you know, these things will be remembered.  And I think, you know, it's just our way of even more than giving the money.  Yeah.  You know, it's our way of showing that we care about them and we love them.  You know what I mean?  So, a radiothon.  This was just the most awful thing that has ever happened.  And this is our country. 
[00:58:30]  And this is, you know, a country, you know, where, you know, anybody has been free to pursue any dream and reach any goal.  And where kids go to school and when they graduate school, they're free to pursue whatever dream they want to go after.  But most important, what I feel, is that the beauty of this country is that we have always had freedom without fear.  Even the midgets. 
[00:59:00]  Do you understand what I'm saying to you?  Yes.  And don't be stupid.  Why?  Because while the president and the military do their job, it's our job now to bring entertainment to people and make them laugh.  How does this radiothon, how is it going to work, Dice?  I don't know.  You're the big brains.  Who's going to be like the Jerry Lewis guy?  Well, I'll be on the West Coast.  You'll be on the East Coast.  You could be like Jerry.  I think we could set it up.  Don't make me get stupid. 
[00:59:30]  Because when I get stupid, I lose it.  You look more like Jerry than we do.  You could be like the Jerry Lewis.  Well, actually, lady.  See?  There you go.  Lady.  Did you see Jerry this year?  You'll never walk alone.  Oh!  You know, coming out, singing that song.  Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.  So you'll be Jerry Lewis.  Can we have a toad?  Jerry Lewis ate all the dog food.  That's why they couldn't find any.  Can we have a toad?  What happened to him?  You fat son of a bitch. 
[01:00:00]  What happened to Jerry?  I actually thought it was a fat guy impersonating Jerry.  Yeah, that's what he looks like now.  You know, and I'm not looking to make fun of Jerry.  I love Jerry.  All right, so you're...  But what went wrong?  You're Jerry Lewis.  What is he eating those kids?  We get it.  We heard those.  Did you really?  Yeah.  Somebody's stealing my jokes.  I can't believe this.  Yeah, fourth grade.  There's something, though.  Yeah, so go ahead.  What were you saying?  All right, so you're Jerry Lewis.  Aunt and I, who are we?  Who's like Ed McMahon?  Who's Ed McMahon? 
[01:00:30]  I'm Paul Anka.  You're going to be Paul Anka?  Doesn't he do it?  All right, you could be like Wayne Newton or something.  All right, so how is this thing going to work?  We do 24...  We set up a studio on the West Coast.  We do 24 straight hours.  You're with us the whole time?  We do 24 straight hours.  Or are you going to pull a Jerry Lewis on us and do five minutes here, five minutes there?  I need it now.  No, no, we do the 24 hours.  I'm dying.  We're bringing all kinds of a...  Anthony.  Yeah.  Believe me, if I was there, I would have to break your wrist.  I would just have to do karate on you. 
[01:01:00]  We're having fun, right?  Nice.  We're having fun, but, you know, we're trying to set this thing up.  Yeah.  You know.  All right, what's your big idea, Anthony?  I don't have one.  All right.  I have no idea.  Talk.  Talk, Dice.  Dumb as milk, this guy.  All right.  What do you feel?  And I thought I'm a moron.  I know.  All right.  What do you think?  What do I think about what?  I think we should steal a van and sit on a billboard.  No?  That's an idea.  All right, go ahead, Dice. 
[01:01:30]  Dice wants to be serious.  What should we do?  Yeah.  No, I'm telling you what we have to do.  All right, well, you've got a studio out on the West Coast.  We've got one.  You've got to get me one.  You're with a big radio station.  How are we going to get people?  And we'll get the talent.  My agents.  How do we get the talent?  Well, my agents are really going to help with that.  You know, they've got a lot of big talent.  You know.  Who would you like on the show?  I don't know.  Who do you got?  We'll try to get Metallica.  Tartop would be nice.  You know, they've got Billy Joel. 
[01:02:00]  They've got everybody.  Oh, yeah.  You know.  Stop with the music.  It's very confusing to a mind like mine.  Gallagher?  Can we get Gallagher to smash?  We'll get a lot of comics.  We'll get Jim Norton there today.  Smash some water that looks like Ben Lada.  Ah, no.  Jim's not here.  What happened?  I spoke to him late last night.  He said he's coming down there.  He's around here somewhere.  Well, where is he?  I don't know.  He's not in the studio.  What, is he analyzing women's urine?  Where is he?  I don't know where he is.  I'm serious.  You know, you've got to stop with the music, really. 
[01:02:30]  Jimi Hendrix.  I know who it is.  Oh.  We can play this as we go to the tote board.  Okay.  Well, you know what?  Let's go to the tote board.  When do you think we could do something like that?  I want to thank the McDonald's Corporation for their generous check.  You stupid ass.  Oh, we're going to get all the celebrities.  You know, you turn the golden arches upside down. 
[01:03:00]  It looks like a big yellow ass.  It's my joke.  It's another one of my jokes.  Can we get Yakov?  Yakov Smirnoff?  We're going to get everybody.  What the country?  I think once we announce this, a lot of people want to be involved in it.  Can we get Paula Poundstone to fondle a child?  Well, if we can't, you've got Norton sitting there.  Shut the music.  This is a great version.  How much heroin did Jimmy have in his system during this? 
[01:03:30]  How much heroin was pumping through Jimmy?  All right.  Obviously, you don't want to do this.  Well, we want to do something to help.  I think Radio Tong is a good idea.  You think it could work out?  Well, they're doing a TV telethon Friday, right?  Yeah, all the networks.  I don't know what they're doing on TV.  Who's doing a TV telethon?  All the networks getting together to simulcast a huge benefit.  How are they going to do that when it's all different channels?  They're a bunch of idiots.  They're going to get Tom Hanks. 
[01:04:00]  Well, of course, you know.  He's been in war for the last 30 years already.  Britney Spears, I believe.  Yeah, did we get Britney Spears on our Radiothon?  Yeah, maybe.  Ooh.  She's nice, right?  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  But we've got to move on this thing.  All right.  So where do we go from here?  I don't know.  It's your radio station.  This is what I keep saying to you.  We've got to set a date.  We've got to start getting the town.  Roll a date. 
[01:04:30]  Roll a date.  So, Dice, what are you saying?  You'd be willing to go on a station that we supply out on the West Coast, and for 24 hours,  if I could use the term, you're going to put yourself out there and be with us and raise  some money?  That's right.  Shut the music, Anthony.  I swear, when I see you, I'm just going to choke you to death.  See, I'm going to get choked by Dice for something I'm not doing. 
[01:05:00]  Would I turn music up this loud if I was playing it and I'm trying to talk?  It's blasting.  Here it is.  It's almost the end.  Jimmy still had the needle hanging out of his arm playing this.  I think he used it as a slide on the fretboard.  Amazing.  I like Dice's idea.  I like it, too.  Dice, you mind if we do it, though, without you?  Hello? 
[01:05:30]  Can he hang off?  Dice.  I'm not talking to you now.  Oh, see, now you're playing games.  I'm mad at you now.  Now you're playing games.  I'm mad.  How can you be mad at a time like this?  I'm mad.  I haven't called in.  I call with something good.  Yeah, it's a very good idea.  You know what I mean?  We like it.  We're just suspicious.  You're going to be up for 24 hours.  What do you mean suspicious?  Don't be suspicious.  You know what?  The people listening, if they think it's a goof, it's not going to turn out the way we want. 
[01:06:00]  No, it's not that.  You're going to be up for 24 straight hours.  Yes.  It's nothing new to me.  I haven't slept in 18 years.  Look at me.  Is this like the Dice that we saw as the postal worker on that Fox TV series a few years back?  What are you talking about?  I mean, this is a sensitive, serious Dice.  You know something with what happened?  Hickory dickory dog.  Bin Laden can suck my ow.  You know?  You're going to do some different drugs?  Well, the one thing those people did do, smart.  Yep. 
[01:06:30]  You see that women, how they're covered, like, with handkerchiefs, giant handkerchiefs?  Right.  And they're never schooled, and they're just used as bang puppets?  That's the only thing they ever did smart in that country.  Bang puppets?  Bill on line one.  Yeah, bang puppets.  I can't say the F word.  Bill on line one loves Dice's radio thong idea.  Do you think, um...  Radio thong?  Like a thong?  What are you talking about, the bang puppets?  No, you said radio thong. 
[01:07:00]  You ever see those women?  You ever see their heads?  Yeah.  I mean, no, they're always wrapped up.  Yeah, let's see them headless.  Anything with hair on it.  Anything with hair on it.  Hey, people are already pledging money, so you're onto something.  No, I'm telling you something.  You know, it'll be the first radio thong ever.  Thong?  Not thong.  Thong.  Thong.  Radio thong.  You know what?  Call it a radio thong.  Have some filthy slobs come in.  Have them move some pisshole putty out. 
[01:07:30]  You know, let them do what they gotta do.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Radio thong.  Radio thong.  Da-dong.  Dong-dong.  Dong.  That'd be like Relief Girls.  You know what I mean?  People are loving the idea.  Yeah, I mean, you know.  We just feel like we're going to do all the work, though.  And you just.  No, you're not going to do all the work.  I'm going to be there.  All right.  You know, everybody is down.  We gotta raise the spirit.  That's what I'm talking about.  Radio thong.  You know, and you're not going to get me off this. 
[01:08:00]  What?  You know.  I mean, I'm just as down as you guys are.  Yeah, I see how down you are.  Which way?  Radio thong.  Which way?  Busco or you bet?  You bet.  You're right.  That's right.  What's that?  Paper or plastic?  Paper.  No.  That's plastic.  What's that?  Paper or plastic?  It's always plastic.  No, it's not.  Oh.  What is that?  Paper or plastic?  Plastic.  No.  Who cares?  What do you mean, who cares? 
[01:08:30]  Paper.  No, I thought that was the answer.  Who cares?  No.  No, that's not who cares.  Oh.  Who cares is a whole different bit.  Oh, I see.  Who cares?  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Medium.  No.  Medium rare.  Medium rare.  You're right.  Of course.  It's medium rare.  All right.  Did we go through this?  Now if you want to play, we can play.  All right.  So we like the radio thong idea.  Are people calling in?  They like the idea?  People like the idea.  I have to pissed at you for goofing on it.  No one's goofing on it.  Yeah, because you guys are morons. 
[01:09:00]  No one's goofing on the idea.  We're goofing on you.  You know, how many markets are you in?  Can we raise about $30 million overnight?  You think so?  In 24 hours?  Yeah.  If you bring your Hollywood friend.  Do you think Howard would do this with us?  Uh, no.  Are you willing to let bygones be bygones?  Uh, no.  Yes.  No.  No.  Yeah, that's what it's all about.  What, being phony?  No.  We have to all the same.  Be whatever you gotta be.  We have to all the same.  Raise the money we want to raise for this.  We gotta make like we're friends?  We are friends. 
[01:09:30]  There is no more fighting.  No more fighting?  We love fighting with you.  No more fighting.  We love fighting with you.  No, not with me.  There was an old Muslim lived in a shoe.  Had so many children, her uterus fell out.  Oh!  It's starting to happen.  It's starting to happen.  Are you gonna sing any songs?  Yeah, I'm gonna sing.  I'm over here now.  And then the new Na Na song, which I gave you a preview of. 
[01:10:00]  Right.  Yeah.  All right.  Can you sing that song?  The Na Na song?  Yeah.  I forgot.  Na, na, na, na, na, na.  Na, na, na, na.  Ducks, you sound retarded.  Well, wait.  They might have been getting to something there.  What do you mean retarded?  Go with it a little bit.  You're allowed to make fun of retarded people.  If you went over to a retarded person and said,  Hey, are you retarded?  Do you think he'd know?  You see what I'm saying?  Let's hear the na, na thing. 
[01:10:30]  Na, na, na, na.  Oh, no.  See, he's going to call back now, all pissed off, and I want him to know Opie hung up.  I did not hang up on Anchor Ice Clay.  I would never do such a thing, Anthony.  I like his radio thong idea.  Da-dong, da-dong, da-dong, da-dong.  Dumps like a truck, truck, truck.  Let me see a what, what, what, oh.  Turn on your hot light. 
[01:11:00]  Let it shine.  Wait a minute.  We could do a little radio thong idea.  He's priceless, man.  I love the Dice Man.  Waiting for him to call back.  Go call.  Usually he calls right back.  Oh, here he is.  I got you now.  Here he goes.  What happened?  Dice, what's wrong with your phone?  I don't know.  What happened?  I don't know what happened.  What happened over there?  You on a cell phone?  With who?  Oh, you on a cell phone? 
[01:11:30]  With who?  With us.  No, I'm talking, I'm talking to me now.  I know, but you're in the middle of the na-na thing.  Yeah, man, we'll get Bob Hope.  Bob Hope?  Yeah.  Well, you've seen him lately.  He looks like Mr. Freeze from the back.  He's been dead and back a thousand times, this guy.  He could do a few minutes for us.  Entertain the troops?  You know what I mean?  Well, people are digging the ideas.  Yeah, but they're going to think it's a goof because of the way you're treating it.  The only way it'll work, though, is if we get celebrities. 
[01:12:00]  Have you listened to our...  We're going to get...  You want me to call my agent right now while we're on the phone?  Uh, no.  Yeah, because he'll tell you the lineup.  All right, give us the lineup.  Mary, Mary, Quacken, Sarah, Muslim women are so damn hairy.  Oh!  Anthony.  Yeah.  I'm trying to set this up.  Guys, it's an homage.  Be a human being.  I'm giving you an homage.  Be a human being a minute.  Yeah, I can't even do my stupid jokes on your stupid show because everything gets dumped.  You've been doing some great jokes on our show. 
[01:12:30]  No, what, the kink joke?  Right.  You think that's really appropriate now that we all have to pull together as Americans?  Yeah, that's not good.  I don't think...  The nation's very sensitive right now.  They should steer away from it.  Yeah, but that's our job.  We need to make them laugh.  We need to raise money.  We need to make them laugh.  Let's leave the midgets away.  Yeah, I'll do, like, a clean, dirty joke.  All right, guys.  Okay?  All right.  All right.  Well, can you say pussy on the air?  Uh, only if it's a cat.  All right.  So we're talking about a cat. 
[01:13:00]  So just say...  Just say...  Why is...  Why is...  Yeah, Curly.  I'm going to go straight and poke my eye out.  I don't know about that.  And that's about a cat.  Yeah, right.  No, they didn't buy that down the hall.  I understand that.  What do you mean they didn't buy it down the hall?  Who's down the hall?  Who's taking bites out of their pet?  I mean, you get it?  It's all about the content.  All right.  I got one. 
[01:13:30]  All right.  I got it.  All right.  Why don't chickens wear underwear?  Why?  Who's on their face?  Is that good?  Is that a good one?  No, that's not a good one.  Can you play that one?  No, you can't do that one either.  All right.  All right.  How do you keep a bagel from getting away?  How?  You put rocks on it.  Bump.  All right.  That's clean.  Yeah.  You can't get away, but it's clean.  Yeah. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  What'd one ocean say to the other ocean?  Huh?  Nothing.  And they just wave.  What do you have when you have two green balls in your hand?  What?  Kermit's undivided attention.  You see what I mean?  We've got to go back to the film.  You went too far.  You see what I mean?  It's going to be all clean jokes like that.  Hold on.  Joe wants in about the radiothon.  Joe?  Hey, guys. 
[01:14:30]  Hey.  You two had a great idea about this radio telethon.  Thanks, man.  But Dice won't take this seriously.  I know.  What's wrong with you, Dice?  You're talking about me.  You're making jokes about this like it's some little thing.  It's my idea.  I heard ONA come up with it first.  What about you?  Oh, hey, hey.  Who came up with it first?  Dice, we've been talking about this on the radio for the last three hours.  Because I told you about it.  What?  And I told you don't talk about it until I come on.  I don't remember that.  You don't remember that?  We had a two and a half conversation last night over that thing there.  Ask our listeners. 
[01:15:00]  Since three o'clock, we've been talking about a great idea we came up with called the radiothon.  They know it's my idea.  They know you're not smart enough to come up with that.  All right.  You want to ask them?  No, I don't want...  No.  Don't start this.  All right.  I'll ask them.  Who am I asking?  Joe.  Yo.  How long have we been talking about the radiothon today?  I would guess since three o'clock.  Yeah.  That's my...  That's my approach to getting it.  They had to say it was my idea, right, Joe?  No, they said it was ONA's idea.  Where are you from, Joe?  It was lunchtime conversation. 
[01:15:30]  Where are you from?  Jersey.  Well, you're not involved in the telethon, all right?  Hang up the phone.  Well, why not?  Because I said so.  Wait, we're going to need all the help.  We're going to need all the help.  I'm sorry.  Why do you hate Jersey?  Hang the phone up, you skank.  I just don't like you for saying they didn't say me.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  All right, Joe.  Anthony, don't know how that grace is on my mind.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  I'm not going to argue with me.  I'm not going to argue with me today.  Hang the phone up, you skank. 
[01:16:00]  No, you don't...  You see, I'm not going to do that.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  Stop it.  Don't talk to me like that.  I'm over here now.  Excuse me, I'm over here now.  Hey, I'm over here now, because you said I'm over here now.  Oh, excuse me, I didn't know you were everybody.  Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo.  Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo.  Boogaloo, boogaloo.  Look what I did to you again.  Yeah, well, maybe I'll do it to you this time, big shot. 
[01:16:30]  Nicey, nice.  Nicey, nice.  Tell me to be nice.  I came in here with my lady, you open your mouth, and I do this to you, and everybody  goes, what I say, and then you hear this.  Oh!  I like the tape dice.  I like the dice on tape.  You like the dice on tape?  Yeah.  I don't even understand the way I talk.  Nah, nah.  Now they don't know if it's me or the tape.  You got so much stuff on me, you could just piece together conversations. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  Look what I did to you again.  Wait, let me do it with it.  Tell me when.  All right.  Hold on.  All right, here I am.  Ready?  Hang the phone up, Drew.  No, not that one.  Which one?  The other thing.  The other thing for you?  Said what?  About who?  In now.  You missed it, see?  No.  Can we get back to this thing?  In now. 
[01:17:30]  You know, everybody's going to think this is a goof.  It's not going to be set up.  You know what?  And now that we've talked about it, somebody else is going to do it, and you're going to  look like idiots.  Vito.  Jerry Tice Lewis.  These guys have been talking about it last Tuesday while you were buried in a hole back  in Hollywood.  What are you talking about?  This is my whole idea.  Nice.  Does it really matter who came up with the idea?  Yeah.  What, do you want credit for it after all this?  No.  I just want to get it done.  Obviously, you're the one that wants credit, because you keep going, we're talking about 
[01:18:00]  the history of the park.  Ah, nah, nah.  Are you going to be wearing a tuxedo?  No.  Why not?  This is a rock and roll telethon.  Oh, rock and roll telethon.  Yeah.  What about the dong?  This is the brawl for it all.  Oh, yeah?  That's right.  All right.  We're going to get some heavy hitters on this.  Who are we getting?  I told you.  You want me to call my guy?  Now, give me some names off the top of your head. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, we don't know anyone.  Yes, you do.  You've got a lot of people.  No.  We'll get an impressionist that does a thousand people.  Don't worry about who we're going to get.  We're going to do this.  Now, when can we do it?  Haven't you been listening to our show for the last three years?  We've never had anyone famous on this show.  We need people.  We're going to get people.  We're going to look stupid.  We have a telethon, a radio telethon, and we don't have anybody.  I woke up with my heart in the right place,  and this idea in the right place.  I got a gaffer from Fort Fairland. 
[01:19:00]  And Anthony keeps doing me.  It's like I don't even want to do me anymore  because this idiot just does me.  You have our hotline.  Get one guy to call us.  This is an immediate thing.  Get one big celebrity to call us.  I got him right here.  John Travolta.  Hey, I got John Travolta.  John, come here.  Just have a look.  Yeah, we're going to do the telethon.  Get out of here, stupid.  What the hell?  John Travolta is going to be on with us.  Do you hear him over there?  No.  I'm on the phone.  I want to get out of here. 
[01:19:30]  I'll give you a crack in the head.  Hey, is Stallone there?  Everybody's here.  Sly, Sly, fix your lip.  Come here.  Say something.  You know, I think we all got to get together.  Shut up, stupid.  That's pretty good, man.  Do something from Rocky.  Whatever I do is perfect.  Do something from Rocky.  Something from Rocky.  What was that?  Like a movie?  Yeah.  As John Travolta.  No.  I can't beat him. 
[01:20:00]  All right.  We didn't ask you to do it all day.  You said, sir, as Travolta.  Oh, what?  Yeah.  All right.  You said beat Travolta in Rocky.  Do walking.  I can't do him.  You did a good walking.  All right.  Are there any girls in there?  Are there any girls in there?  Yes.  Then let me in.  Do you have pecan ice cream?  Yes.  You have to say yeah.  When I say something? 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  You say yeah.  No, wait, wait till I ask you for something.  Okay.  All right.  Do you have pecan ice cream?  Yeah.  Then let me have some.  You see what I mean?  How I do that?  And people are going to listen to this for 24 straight hours.  See, Jay Moore thinks he does the walking.  I do.  He does Dean Martin.  What?  He does a great Dean Martin.  How about Eric Roberts?  Love the Eric Roberts.  What's the matter?  You don't want to stick it in my ass?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I don't think 
[01:21:00]  I can say that.  Hold on.  That was too good.  And they dumped out of that, my friend.  Why'd they dump out?  Because you're describing something in the Das Dimpierre.  Yeah.

It'll be like a pre-Christmas thing.  That's a true American.  You know what I mean?  All right.  Yeah.  I went to a pre-Christmas party.  I gave this chick a mouthful of...  No, you can't.  Can you use that?  No.  You know what?  For that day, they're going to have to give us a waiver on language also.  Yeah, dice.  You can't say you have to stop. 
[01:24:30]  See, it's not a place for...  No, we're not going to curse.  It's all going to be nice.  It's a place for the dirty language.  This is something we should really do and do it the right way without goofing around.  All right.  And now I'm bringing on a big star, the cameraman from Casual Sex.  Anthony, I'll give you your address in Brooklyn.  Don't make me give you your address in Brooklyn.  I moved, dice.  I know where you moved.  That's why I have the address.  Chris is saying this is his best idea since Brain Smasher. 
[01:25:00]  I liked Brain Smasher.  Yeah.  Who cares if you don't?  All right, listen.  Like, I think about these things.  All right, dice.  We really got to go.  I don't care if you got to go.  What are we doing?  We got to go.  All right.  So what do we do now?  Got to work out the details.  Call your guy.  See who you can get.  You want me to call him right now?  Yeah, call him.  Yeah, after you hang up with us.  No, no.

You actually have a great relationship with dice.  You like the dice, man.  Nah, nah, nah.  How much fun dueling dice?  I love it.  It's fun dueling dice.  Right?  All right, we got to take a little bit of a break, huh?  Yeah.  All right, yeah.  I haven't broke in about an hour.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Let me let you ladies in on something. 
[01:26:00]  Oral never gets old.  Home of the Hummer.  1027 WNEW.  Hey, it's 1027 WNEW.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're trying to find the Cosby story, Anthony.  Yeah.  We were all over the Cosby story yesterday.  Usually.  But I guess in the paper today, there's a new Bill Cosby stamp. 
[01:26:30]  There's a picture of the Cos and Felicia Rashad, who played the wife Claire Huxtable on the  Cosby show in the 80s.  And the U.S. Postal Service has put out a stamp commemorating the Cosby show.  So that means everyone could lick the Cos. 
[01:27:00]  Everyone can now lick the Cos without the Cos getting in trouble, you see.  I see.  Because as you remember yesterday, a girl claims I tried to grab her hand and stick it down  the Cos's pants.  To play what's in the Cos's pants.  What's in the Cos's pants.  Right.  Looks like a snake peeking its head out of a pool rack full of Afro hair.  White Afro hair.  We got a little gray.  Filter fly. 
[01:27:30]  The interesting thing about the Cosby stamp is that the Cos himself makes his own adhesive  for the stamp, you see.  Yeah.  Just continuous line of 20-year-old girls putting their hands down the Cos's pants.  Girl.  Stickier than Jell-O pudding down there.  Yeah.  Filth floor and filth.  Stamp shows the living room of the Huxtable House. 
[01:28:00]  Well, they fit a lot of stuff on this little stamp, huh?  It's the entire living room of the Huxtable House.  Yeah.  The couch where little Rudy sat with her little mustache.  The stairway that Theo would come down and I'd teach them about how to get girls to put  their hands down their hands down your pants like your father.  Like, oh, boy.  Feels good.  It's a little gooey.  Wiggly, wiggly, wiggly, wiggly.  Feels the floor. 
[01:28:30]  Girl.  Suck my Huxtable.  All right.  On the stamp, I've got the couch.  Remember the memorable couch of the Cosby Show where I first sat with Felicia Rashad as  we was kissing and I whipped it out and just said, hey, what are we going to do about this?  Jay Moore joke from yesterday.  Girl.  Far and filth from far.  That's a good callback from yesterday, Cosby. 
[01:29:00]  What are we going to do about this?  Phil.  So are you denying these charges there, Mr. Cos?  Deny, deny, deny all the charges from the 20-year-old chippy that said, I tried to stuff her hand  down the front of my pants.  I tried to stuff my hand down the front of her pants.  She goes down there, big pool rack for her too. 
[01:29:30]  Girl, filth from far.  Young actresses say the darndest things, huh?  She wanted to touch Fat Albert.  That's what I call them.  Down in my pants.  Fat Albert.  Girl, filth from far.  Big and fat like a tuna can.  Hey, Cos, you're just not getting in with your wife Camille anymore or what?  You have to...  My wife Camille couldn't get wet in the rainforest.  The Cos is 60 years old and so is Camille. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  And the Cos needs something a little younger.  Well, what's the problem with Camille when she's naked?  Oh, my God.  That's not even funny.  Filth and flarn and filth.  Flarn.  It's disgusting.  It's disgusting.  It's dry, dry, dry.  Big camel toe.  She got a big...  Look, here it is.  Hello?  Hey, Camille.  Look, I'll give you a tour of Camille again. 
[01:30:30]  Hey.  Hello?  Look, it's little Rudy.  Here comes little Rudy.  There's Theo.  And the other kids, I can't remember the names of.  Phil.  And here, here, here, here come Fat Albert.  And the Cos, the kids.  Running out of Camille's big game.  Hey, hey, hey. 
[01:31:00]  You see?  Hey, hey, hey.  That was the Cos's boner.  And I want to sing a song for you.  Now put your hand down the Cos's pants.  Brrr.  Brrr.  Brrr.  Brrr.  Brrr.  So it's going to be a new Cosby stamp.  Yeah, seems that way.  Seems that way. 
[01:31:30]  Looking forward to, uh, licking the Cosby stamp.  Licking the Cos?  Lick the Cos and put it on your letter, girl.  Touch my penis.  Yeah, girl.  You see?  I would like to talk to you about my penis.  Okay, terrific.  Is this the best radio you guys could come up with?  1027 WNEW. 
[01:32:00]  We have Mike from the garage in the studio.  He's a good friend of ours.  Yeah.  We see him every day.  We're going to call you Jamaican, Mike.  That's cool.  Yeah.

And I'll just go there.  Later.  Chris from the Bronx wants Jamaican Mike to say, look what I did to you again.  With that accent it has.  Mike, you have to say that for us.  To say, look what I did to you again.  Look what I did to you again. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, I'm on.  Mary, what's going on?  I'm calling in about the fact that the Jamaicans,  the man that called in earlier that said that his fiance is down there  and she's calling him.  Yeah.  Better watch out because I live with the Jamaicans.  Yeah.  And that little stereotype about the big thing, it's true.  It's true.  Oh, yeah.  My boyfriend's from Cholani.  Cholani?  I'm from St. Thomas.  Okay.  St. Thomas.  Between Portland and Kingston. 
[01:55:30]  Right.  Yeah.  He's got family there as well.  They measure distance and penis over there.  So that's like, what, 25 penis away or something like that?  Wow.  All right.  And Mary, he just pounds you and pounds you.  He takes care of it every night.  Mary, how huge is it?  Is it like a shopping bag now?  Can you remember when it was the size of a normal private area? 
[01:56:00]  No.  No.  It was seven years, my junior, seven years, you know, it just, he takes care of it.  That's all that fits.  Does it give you acid reflux from hitting your stomach?  It's like an old, it's like an old man's mouth when he pops his teeth out.  Oh, God.  Oh, man.  You walk like you have a rash all the time.  No.  No? 
[01:56:30]  You get used to it after a while, but I'm not going nowhere else.  But that's it.  You can't, there's no turning back now.  You've set the bar to a certain level and it's over.  When you're naked and you're walking around your house, does it sound like you're wearing corduroys?  No, it's fine.  But he takes care of it and well.  Jamaican?  Yeah.  When you get into the bathtub, does the water level go down?  Well, I love you, you guys are great. 
[01:57:00]  He got me into listening to you.  All right.  You're wrong.  Thank you.  Oh, man.  That's something.  We're breaking some ground here.  Finding out Jamaicans have really big ones.  Geez.  Sarah.  Yeah.  Hey, how are you?  Very good.  How are you guys?  We're doing all right. 
[01:57:30]  You guys are the greatest.  You make my drive home the greatest.  Thank you.  When I was down in Jamaica, they have lots of wooden statues with these large Jamaican  junks, if you will.  Really?  They call it the big bamboo.  And they have a shirt that say, who's afraid of the bamboo?  That's how you get used to looking at it on a statue before you have to see the real  thing, I'm sure.  If you want to try it out, you get back into it.  It's the plunger thing all over again.  Oh, man.  So, did you have any of that Jamaican sex down there? 
[01:58:00]  No, I didn't.  I was 12, but a lot of Jamaicans were interested in me.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Okay.  Terrific.  Yeah.  Have a great day, guys.  All right.  Take care.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Brad.  Hot and huge penises.  Why would girls come back?  Why do they come back?  Yeah.  Why do they come back, Mike?  That's like a strip club that gives away free beer and never closes.  Right.  Why would the guy leave?  Brad.  Oh, and hey.  What's up, guys? 
[01:58:30]  How are you?  How are you doing, Jamaican, Mike?  I'm doing pretty good.  You?  I'm doing all right.  All right.  I got this ridiculous story.  I better be careful how I tell it to being on the radio, but you hear it.  Yeah.  All right.  So a friend of mine, he's a close friend of mine, he went down to Jamaica for spring break  this year, and he went into this bar, and they were actually having, what's the best  way to put this, just random girls at the bar, they were having an oral contest.  How's that?  Whoa. 
[01:59:00]  That was a wrong place.  Like a hummer contest?  Absolutely.  So girls that were just at the bar were giving hummers to guys?  He said basically it were a bunch of random guys they had lined up there, and they were  just picking out of these just drunk girls that were just at the bar, and they all, you  know, got down and all at the same time started, and whoever could get the guy first got like prizes  and drinks and stuff like that.  Wow. 
[01:59:30]  He said it was pretty unbelievable.  Yeah.  Keep going, baby.  Keep going.  Keep going.  And I'm almost there.  It's all good, though.  It's all good.  All right, Brad.  Take care.  Thank you.  Let's go.  Thank you.  Johnny, what's up?  Hey, man.  What's going on?  How are you?  I got a funny Jamaican story for you.  I had no idea what Jamaica was all about, that the men's units down there were huge.  Ten years ago, get married, right?  My wife and I, we were only with each other before this. 
[02:00:00]  We were two virgins on our honeymoon.  We got down there.  And, you know, you go to the club med scene or the hotel down there, and you stay kind  of by yourself.  Well, one night we decided to venture out to go to the local scene to kind of catch out  what's going on.  Biggest mistake ever.  Wow.  We go to this luau, this type of thing where all the local guys are there.  We're hanging around a bonfire, eating and drinking.  All of a sudden, my wife starts to dance with one of these guys.  And this guy started sporting wood, if you know what I'm saying. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, my God.  Dude, that thing could have covered half of D.C.  He was like an umbrella.  He was like an umbrella in a shade.  Ever since then, man.  Ever since then.  Excuse me.  Can we see your stuff? 
[02:01:00]  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Torture!  It's torture!  Wow.  So what happened, Johnny?  So I'm sitting here in amazement, and her eyes are like the same.  A snake from Jungle Book.  You know what I mean?  That snake with the eyes are all googly-eyed, and she's just like staring at that thing. 
[02:01:30]  Dude, it has never been the same.  Ten years later, it has never been the same.  She looks at like bananas different now.  Oh, yeah?  I'm sticking in my mouth.  Of course, talking about the joints in Jamaica, Anthony.  Yeah, the joints.  The joints.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ouch.  I never, I never sized up since then.  Yeah.  Wow.  I just have to thank, you know, the Jamaican men for ruining it for the rest of us small  white men.  Thanks a lot, Mike. 
[02:02:00]  All right.  Take care.  Bye, Johnny.  Bye-bye.  Wow.  It's only natural, man.  Oh, my God.  That's awful.  That was on the natural.  That was hilarious.  The girl, the snake from Jungle Book.  I was getting this big.  She's just looking at that.  Whoa, that's horrible.  Her face was like those wacky paintings you see in the subway where the girls had the big,  huge eyes.  Hey, Mike. 
[02:02:30]  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  How are you doing?  All right, I got a story for you.  Yeah.  I was down in Jamaica for spring break about two months ago.  All right, I'm at this bar.  First of all, these guys, these local guys are cool, but they, you know, they go, they  flock to the bars, and they just, you know, we'll stand around all cool in the back of  the bar with, like, the joints behind her.  There's plane loads of white chicks coming in.  I mean, why wouldn't you want to go to the bars?  I see.  There comes another one, man.  We go out.  I see the hottest white girl I've ever seen.  All right.  I see her.  I don't have the courage to go talk to her. 
[02:03:00]  Finally, like, on the third night, I get a couple of red stripes with me.  I'm going to go and talk to her.  I see her in the corner of the bar hooking up with this Rastafarian guy, this Jamaican  guy.  She's rubbing his junk.  She's all over this guy, and I am just heartbroken.  And my confidence the entire week just went down the tubes, man.  It was traumatic.  Once you put that thread, you couldn't forget about it, man.  Yeah, here's you.  Ooh.  Exactly.  The Jamaican Mike did you?  There she is. 
[02:03:30]  I knew that comparison again.  That's too good.  The white guy.  White guy in Jamaica.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  And the guy that she was with at the bar.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Anthony.  Yo.  How are ya?  I was down in Jamaica a couple weeks ago. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  And there I am.  I hook up with these two girls and I meet one of the guys from the entertainment guy of  the, uh, the, uh, the resort I was at.  Uh-huh.  And we end up going back to their room, you know, having some fun with the girls.  I see this guy's hammer come out.  Oh, yeah?  It was the biggest thing I have ever done.  It didn't get any bigger.  It was just, it was like down to, like, almost his knee.  And the damn thing, it didn't get any bigger.  It didn't swell.  It just stood up. 
[02:04:30]  Like a sleeping Doberman, you know, when they wake up and they just get up.  The damn thing just stood up and looked at me.  I said, oh, my God.  I had to get the hell out of there.  I lost it.  I just walked out of the room.  See you later, precious.  Oh, my God.  Darren, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  How's it going?  We're doing all right.  Yeah, I got a friend who's a waiter, and he's got a buddy at work. 
[02:05:00]  Jamaican guy.  He's got into a contest in his country for the biggest penis.  He, they have these, they have these contests down there in little villages.  He's got a 14-inch penis.  What?  And guess what, guys?  He came in third place.  What?  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  I mean, if I go down there, I'll have to enter the women's competition, and I'll probably 
[02:05:30]  lose.  Thanks, guys.  Terrible.  All right, take care.  Oh.  You're the losers.  Yeah.  Oh.  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Junkzilla.  Oh.  Ed, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Uh, you're going to make me drive off the road.  I was down in Jamaica, and at one of these all-inclusive resorts, and they had this guy, 
[02:06:00]  the Body Man, who took us all on a picnic.  There were five guys, five white guys.  A picnic man.  Yeah, a picnic.  Or so we thought.  A picnic.  There were five white guys, five white girls, and the Body Man.  The Body Man.  He takes us out into the, uh, into the ocean, into like thigh-deep water.  And we started these drinking games with rum punch and everything.  Yeah.  Well, one thing leads to another, and everybody starts to get naked. 
[02:06:30]  And of course, what happens when white guys go in the ocean?  They got the turtle head.  So there were five of us standing there.  I've never been more humiliated in my life.  He takes down his shorts, and this thing is down like three-quarters of the way down his  tie.  Oh, man.  That's great, man.  That's great.  Why the hell would you fall down there?  That's great.  Why would you take off your, uh, your trunks, let's say, if you know you have a turtle head? 
[02:07:00]  Biggest mistake of my life.  He said if you wanted to stay there, you had to take your shorts off.  Oh, yeah, sure.  It eliminates the competition.  Exactly.  That's their plan.  They get whitey down there, and they take advantage of it.  You really ain't good, man.  That's what I did.  Oh, God damn it.  You guys are hilarious.  That is awful. 
[02:07:30]  Um, Mark.  Hey, dude.  Hey.  Oh, man.  I went into the CVS like two weeks ago, and they said, oh, hey, your wife's got pictures.  Do you want to pick them up?  I said, yeah, sure.  What the heck?  She was down in Jamaica.  I'm in the car, man.  She's down there with her girlfriend.  I got pictures of her, her girlfriend, and Long Dong Silver laying in the bed. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, laying in the bed?  Yeah.  And I'm like, what the hell am I going to do with this now?  You know what I mean?  Oh, man.  I pulled the picture out.  She hasn't said anything.  I don't even know.  And I said, okay, fine.  Who took the damn picture?  You guys are killing it, man.  Maybe they had the camera set up on a tripod, and he just hit it with his slung.  I think he was holding it with the end of his slung because I couldn't see the tip of it.  Wow.  That's funny, Mark. 
[02:08:30]  Dude, man.  It's the Jamaican Heart Lonely Club today.  You're killing it.  All right, Mark.  Thank you.  God bless you, man.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Yeah, man.  Hey.  What's up, guys?  What's up, Luis?  Hey, man.  I went to Jamaica around two years ago, and I'm hooking up with this black Jamaican girl.  And she's telling me that I'm the first white guy she's ever had, right?  So bring her back to the hotel room.  And I'm around like seven inches, so I'm like, you know, I think that I'm good and stuff.  And I whip it out, and it's all ready.  I'm ready to go.  And she says, wait a minute. 
[02:09:00]  You need some Viagra?  I got some Viagra in the back.  I'm like, what do you mean, Viagra?  I'm like, this is me, man.  What are you talking about?  She's like, no, no.  I got some Viagra.  Hold on.  Wait a minute.  Not big enough, Luis.  We're having issues, man.  What the hell is up with these Jamaicans?  That's not average, though, man.  All right.  You guys rule, man.  All right.  Thank you.  Better.  Oh, man.  This is too fun today.  That's awful.  Hey, Rod.  Yeah, guys.  What's happening? 
[02:09:30]  How are you?  All right.  I'm doing good.  Hey, let me tell you something.  I was taking my girl down to Florida in a couple weeks, and I figured I'd give her a  little special surprise to go over to Jamaica.  So I was going to go get the tickets this weekend.  Let me tell you something.  I got one thing to say to you, Tracy, because I know you're listening.  You're going to Disneyland.  You're going to Disneyland.  You are going to Disneyland.  You are not getting unleashed in the land of the Caribbean Cyclops.  You're not.  There you go.  It's not happening.  Orlando, man.  That's it.  You are staying continental, baby. 
[02:10:00]  I still love you, but, you know, we just got to make sure we keep hold of what we  got.  Go to Jamaica and have fun, man.  Don't be scared.  All right, Rod.  All right, guys.  Be good.  Closest she's going to get is Pirates of the Caribbean.  Disneyland.  Disneyland.  Disneyland.  And unlike Disney, it's not a small world in Jamaica, man.  All right, man.  We got to take a break.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's great, man.  That's horrible, man. 
[02:10:30]  Oh.  Why would a guy go down there?  Why would a crazy white boy go down to Jamaica?  Oh, this guy.  To Jamaica.  Hey, look at this clip.  I've seen this clip.  Oh, what's the...  Oh, the guy that lifts stuff with his schlong.  Yeah.  The guy look weak.  I mean, I can understand that you're a single guy, maybe.  You want to go down there and smoke more pot than you've ever smoked in your life.  That's one thing.  But if you got a chick and you go down there, you're insane. 
[02:11:00]  Or if you let your chick go down there alone with one of her girlfriends.  Oh.  Like, that's going to help.  Oh, she'll go with a girlfriend.  They'll protect each other.  No.  Skewered like shish kebab, the two of them.  Like a piece of beef and a pepper on a skewer.  That's it, man.  Quick break, and we'll be back.  What kind of show is this?  It was like somebody pouring hot wax in your ears until your brain was completely gone.  The Alfie and Anthony Show. 
[02:11:30]  1027 WNEW.  All right, we're going to talk to the guy that was injured at a fast food restaurant.  Very similar story, like the one that appears in the papers today.  Uh, hello.  Hello.  Hey, what's up?  Hello.  Yeah, what's up, buddy?  Oh, I was very injured.  Where were you injured?  At a fancy coffee shop.  Okay.  Okay.  I was drinking coffee. 
[02:12:00]  You know how it makes you have to pinch a loaf?  Sure.  When you drink too much.  Yeah.  I went to the bathroom.  Okay.  And I was very nervous.  Uh-huh.  And I had a loose stool.  Ah.  Very messy.  Yeah.  And I couldn't find the toilet paper.  Okay.  Like the gentleman that you read about.  Yeah, in the paper today.  All right.  And I went to reach back and like him, the toilet seat shifted.  Okay.  It snapped down on my penis like a bear trap.  Oh.  Now it's all flattened like a fruit roll-up. 
[02:12:30]  I was screaming in pain.  Uh-huh.  And one of the workers came in and started laughing at me.  And why was he...  And my ass was still soiled.  And I'm suing.  It was...  I was degraded.  You were very degraded, huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  And now I can't have coital relationships with my wife no more.  Well, were you having sex before the mishap?  Well...  No.  Oh, I see.  But now it's very embarrassing.  I see.  Because we tried. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  And she was laughing at me.  Because when I got excited, it looked like one of those party favors.  It unrolled.  You ever see the kids' parties?  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  My schlong was bashed apart.  And I lost my glasses.  What is...  And my shoes.  You lost your glasses and shoes when you were injured.  And I spilled a hot coffee latte on my testicles.  Oh.  I got off the boat screaming, help me.  Yeah. 
[02:13:30]  And I slipped in my own feces and fell on a toilet plunger.  And it impaled me in my back door.  Oh.  We didn't need to hear that.  Oh.  All the while, they were laughing at me.  Uh-huh.  They just said they'd get me a new coffee latte.  Right.  But I couldn't drink in the establishment with a plunger lodged in my rear end.  No.  I don't think that would work.  My penis was damaged.  Dammit.  I know.  That's what you said.  I hear you're suing for like two million dollars.  Two million.  Yeah. 
[02:14:00]  I can only make love to a coin slot now.  Slant and damaged.  Horrible.  I went to the hospital.  They laughed at me.  Yeah.  I wanted to hook it up to some kind of air pump at the gas station.  Pump some new life into that thing.  Try to easy inflate.  Sure.  Like a basketball pump.  Right.  And I said, oh, you're hurting me.  And they all laughed at my broiled testicles.  I must say you're a mess.  I'm suing.  Okay.  Oh. 
[02:14:30]  For two million dollars over injured peepee.  Oh.  Hey, could I speak to Anthony?  Um.  Pull that one off, smart ass.  Oh.  Well, Anthony's smoking a cigarette, sir.  Stop it.  His mother doesn't want to hear that.  She'll be very angry.  Oh, what?  If he learns he's even smoking.  Are you related to Anthony?  No, but I know his mother.  She'll be pissed.  She'll be pissed.  She'll be pissed if she knows that you're smoking a pack a day.  Shut up.  He's not smoking anymore. 
[02:15:00]  He was smoking for a couple of weeks during a trying period in his life.  I see.  Shut the ass up.  I also have heard that Anthony may be freebasing at this point.  Don't even start those rumors.  Alright, I'll give in to the cigarette smoke.  Okay.  This is getting too real.  Shut up.  Okay.  So, there's no truth to the freebasing rumors.  None.  Okay.  I don't know where that came from.  All right.  So, your stupid brother.  All right.  Your mom wanted to know. 
[02:15:30]  That's all.  I figured we'd bring it up on the air today.  Whose mom?  Mine?  Anthony's mom.  Oh, Anthony.  Yeah.  Put him on the phone.  Well, he's still busy smoking that cigarette, remember?  He's not smoking.  Shut up.  Oh, Anthony.  Yeah.  Put him on the phone.  Well, he's still busy smoking that cigarette, remember?  He's not smoking.  Shut up.  Oh, he's gonna sue you.  Anthony will, my pal.  He doesn't smoke.  Okay.  It was for a couple of weeks.  Okay.  But he quit again.  Well, whose cigarettes are these in the studio then? 
[02:16:00]  Shut up.  There are no cigarettes in there.  If his mother hears, she's very angry.  Okay.  Oh, he's screwed.  He's screwed.  He really should.  You know, if Anthony's gonna be smoking again, he really should buy the ones with filters.  They are.  Okay.  They were.  They were filtered cigarettes.  I'm gonna kick your ass.  Oh.

[02:22:00]  in my belt because they don't make them that small to fit around that little piece of thread that  connects my abdomen to my thorax how does anything pass through there i don't know i'm just an ant i don't  know how i work i eat the godiva chocolate all of a sudden it goes from my thorax my huge mandible 
[02:22:30]  down my little neck my little ant neck into my thorax it's got to pass through there to get out the back  then somehow all that godiva chocolate squeezes through that little thing that connects my thorax to  my abdomen it's no bigger than a hair of a human we've seen him i'm in great fear after this attack  the children might turn a magnifying glass on me you know you put it in front of the sun a magnifying 
[02:23:00]  glass who didn't do that as a kid i just moved into a child's ant farm i'm very happy i'm in chamber  one sixty five right next to the larvae that's a promotion huh because last time you were working  above yes i'm down pretty down into the into the ant farm now i'm hoping to work my way into the
