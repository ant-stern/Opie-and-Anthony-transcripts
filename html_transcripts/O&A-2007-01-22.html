<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly between politics, pop culture, personal anecdotes, and listener calls.  The show opened with a discussion of the 2008 Presidential election, focusing on Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and John Edwards, with extensive, often crude and stereotypical commentary on their electability based on race and gender.  This included sexually explicit jokes about Bill Clinton's infidelity and Hillary Clinton's perceived charisma.  They also mocked a newscaster reporting on the Chicago Bears' Super Bowl win and heavily criticized the radio show *John and Jeff*, playing their promos and making disparaging remarks about their content.  A running gag involved a mystery item found in Opie's backpack. The hosts also discussed the unexpected success of *Stomp the Yard*, offering a humorous, sarcastic critique of the plot, and reacted to a seemingly unreliable poll about voters' willingness to elect a woman or a Black president.  The segment included lengthy discussions of comedian Jimmy's experiences in Chicago.

The show continued with a humorous bit about an exploding hard drive, followed by another satirical parody of *John and Jeff*, highlighting their misogynistic views on women, DNA testing, and the age of consent. Opie and Anthony then created their own offensive parody, introducing the concept of the "Goon Hand."  Listener calls followed, discussing popular reasons for traveling to Thailand, with several callers offering excuses related to military service or employment. One caller shared a humorous anecdote about encountering a transgender person in Thailand.  The conversation then shifted to a political cartoon in the New York Post depicting President Bush and a story about Opie finding a "Black Inches" magazine in his girlfriend's possession, sparking a discussion about suspicion and guilt. They recounted an anecdote about an XM radio employee placing sex toys in Opie's backpack.  A significant portion focused on the fallout from a previous interview with Taylor Hicks, debating who—Opie or guest Jay Moore—used offensive language towards the publicist, and playing audio from the interview to analyze the situation. The segment concluded with Opie detailing a poker game with Kevin Smith where he lost $500, followed by a brief call from Kevin Smith himself.


The next segment began with Anthony recounting a disastrous poker game where he lost a significant amount of money, blaming his opponents (including Kevin Smith) for bullying tactics.  The conversation then moved to a chance encounter with a frail Soupy Sales and a meeting with Karen Lynn Gorney at a convention.  A significant portion featured two guests from ClassicCarClub.com, who detailed Anthony's experience test-driving a Lamborghini Gallardo at 135 mph on Ocean Parkway, along with subsequent drives in other high-performance vehicles.  A humorous anecdote about bumper car driving at a child's birthday party followed.  The "What Did You Learn?" segment included listener calls, criticisms, and responses to negative comments from message boards, with the hosts defending their show's approach.  This also included a discussion of an MSNBC interview about a radio contest that resulted in a contestant's death from water intoxication and the ensuing fallout, including firings.


The show continued with a post-mortem analysis of the fatal radio contest, discussing potential legal and professional ramifications and referencing a past incident involving marshmallows and a bunny suit.  A caller, Lindsay, engaged in a conversation with Opie, characterized by long pauses and incoherent responses, ending abruptly with a deliberate hang-up. Lindsay called back later, continuing the gag.  In-studio guest Flea was criticized for taking unauthorized photos of the hosts, prompting attempts to have them deleted.  The conversation then shifted to government actions regarding offshore gambling sites and its implications for Anthony, veering into broader political commentary on freedom in America and the Venezuelan political situation, mentioning Hugo Chávez.  The show concluded with a detailed discussion about their weekend radio program, "The Razzle Dazzle Variety Hour," particularly the "Musical Adventure Hour," featuring staff-selected music and hosts' mocking commentary. A listener's story about a black sexual encounter was also discussed, leading to a digression on the hosts' racial biases.


A phone call with Diana and Chris followed, focusing on Diana's mixed-race baby, with numerous sexually suggestive and racially charged comments from the hosts about the baby's appearance and the couple's relationship.  The hosts questioned Diana about her baby's father and her boyfriend's reaction to the child's appearance, probing into details about their sex life and speculating about the racial dynamics of their relationship. The conversation included discussion of Diana's physical attributes, and Chris, initially assumed to be Black, was revealed to be white.  The segment included numerous crude jokes and sexually explicit language and ended with a brief discussion of legal concerns regarding on-air content, followed by a promotion for Jim Norton's segment and the "Line of the Day" segment, featuring several vulgar entries.

Um, I don't know  Juan  Pedro

Is it  It's just one of those really oldie time kind of racist remarks  But the Post had no problem, uh, putting it in their paper  Very funny  But yeah, so it's  It's a big race, um, sex, sex thing 
[00:03:30]  The Democratic ticket  And, uh, we were talking in the office  It's just, uh, a mess  It's amazing because, uh, the Republicans basically go  Here you go  Yeah  Here, here's everything  We gave you an eight-year head start  Here you go  Here  And the Democrats are gonna blow it  They're gonna blow it  All they need  They're gonna blow it  Is a moderate  White guy  Sorry  That's just  It's America 
[00:04:00]  You gotta appeal to  Middle America with these things  And what they want  Is the moderate  White guy  Some guy that can  Like Bill Clinton  Kind of get in there  Has some ideas  You know  Runs on a platform  Of hope  You know  My story  Starts in hope  And  You know  They want someone like that  Not this  Friggin'  I don't know what the hell they're running  It's  It's just not gonna work  America's sorry  Not ready 
[00:04:30]  They're not ready  Everyone's talking  Are they ready?  Ready for a black president?  Ready for a woman?  Ready for a Hispanic?  Ready for a giraffe?  Ready for  What are you ready for?  Right  One of those are running two  We're not ready  The country  Not ready  At this point  The Democrats  Might as well run a koala bear  They're cute  Just get a koala bear  You ever see one?  They're adorable  Well I guess we gotta trust them  They're telling us that a koala bear  Could be president 
[00:05:00]  It could be  So you know what's gonna happen?  People are gonna walk into that voting booth  And yank that handle down  For Republican  Look I like to  I like to try to have an open mind  I'm like man yeah  Maybe America's ready for a black president  Maybe America's ready for the first female president  And then I'm like  No they're not  Even I'm saying that  And I like to try to keep an open mind  And people like to bring up Margaret Thatcher  You know she ran England for quite some time 
[00:05:30]  She was more of a man than you and I  It was  And England is that type of thing where that's okay  You know that's kind of a thing where they do accept that  They bow to the queen you know  The queen has been in charge  So they're kind of used to being run by a woman  It's not something new  It's too new to us  We just need like a woman vice president first  Somebody that can really 
[00:06:00]  Baby steps right  You know grab the bull bite up  Horns  Baby steps  And Hillary now is just going in full bore  A lot of people are wondering  And asking Bill Clinton about it  And he's just hysterical  He was at some function  And somebody from the press came up and asked him  The second he walked in  Said what do you think about the prospects of perhaps  Moving back to the White House  And he had some kind of beverage  And he's walking around  Like just networking  And he just goes to the reporter 
[00:06:30]  He goes  How are you going to have to ask her about that  I don't know  I don't care  I just picture him in his pajama bottoms  As the tours go through  Just scratching himself  Hey what do you do  What do you want  You don't want to see old desk or nothing  Just come in here and watch some TV  I got some like pork rinds and chips  Don't you hope that Hillary wins it all  Just so he can see all that  Just so he can see Bill  Just like not being responsible whatsoever  He doesn't care anymore  He is better out of office than he was in 
[00:07:00]  Of course  At this point  He has nothing to lose now  Love the guy  Nothing to lose  He's got his presidential legacy  Which includes that whole debacle  With the Oval Office  And the extracurricular activities with interns  But if she did win  Let's just picture that  All those things that happen  When someone's president  The walk  The couple takes the walk  Out to the marine one  The helicopter waiting outside  What's Bill going to do  He's just going to be standing out  In his PJs waving 
[00:07:30]  Bye bye honey  I'll hold down the floor  While you're gone  Yeah he doesn't care  There's chicks coming in at night  She's dressed like some kind of  You see her  She's dressing like  Old Victorian era clothing  Yeah  She's got like that thing  That comes up to the chin  From her neck  With the lace  And the  She's trying to look regal  Well she's trying to get rid  Of the turkey neck  Big turkey neck  She's trying to look young  And I promise to  I don't know if I can handle 
[00:08:00]  Like one of her speeches  With that  No  We are going to change  The way America runs  With me being your president  She is the worst  At giving the politician speech  It's the David Caruso version  Of a political speech  It's so typical  Where they start off low  We must do something  About social security 
[00:08:30]  Do you know that your children  Aren't going to have  Any money left  It's one of my favorites  Turn on some Slim Whitman music  I want to see her head explode  It's one of my favorite things man  It's got the strangest speech pattern  When it comes to talking in public  It's that politician speech  It's like she's revving up an engine  And you know what it shows?  Phoniness  It shows  She's got no  Hillary doesn't have 
[00:09:00]  A human side  You can't look at her  Like Bill was a human  I think that did  A lot to getting him elected  When he sat down  In interviews  He was like  A regular guy  And stuff  And then when he got elected  He had to be  A little more presidential  But she just  I don't know anything about  What she feels  Emotionally about anything  You know how she feels  About what the polls say  And how she's supposed  To make that better  And she's got some ideology  About health care and stuff  But emotionally 
[00:09:30]  What is she?  What is she about?  What is she like?  I don't know  What does she enjoy doing  As a person?  Remember she couldn't commit  To one baseball team  When she first became  The senator of New York  She didn't want to piss off  The Mets fans  She didn't want to piss off  The Yankee fans  Subway series  Yeah they asked her  Who are you rooting for?  And she had this stupid answer  Where it was like  Where she liked both teams  Giuliani  Loving her head  I was like  What team you like?  Yankees  I'm a Yankee fan  That's the way it is  And she's switching hats 
[00:10:00]  Depending on what stadium  She's at  Every inning  She's switching hats  Yeah  Every inning  And then also  She's wearing a Cubs hat  Because she spent time  In Chicago  I was in Chicago  Just tell us what you're doing  Just tell us what you like  People respect that in the end  We don't know her as a person  And that's going to affect her  The Obama thing  Sorry America  It just isn't ready for it  It isn't ready  And this guy  Is probably  One of the most  Charismatic 
[00:10:30]  And qualified  Maybe not qualified  He doesn't have enough time  In any one office  But he's like  He's charismatic  He's very charismatic  And that goes a long way  But they're just not ready  They're just not ready  You think the women  Will vote for Hillary  In droves?  No  Women will sooner vote  For a good looking guy  Than a woman  I think women get catty  In the polls  What about  They get a little catty  What about  John Edwards  John Edwards  Has a good shot 
[00:11:00]  To win  The Democratic ticket  White guy  Girls find him attractive  I love how we're looking  At Anthony  Like he's Chris Matthews  Like he's a political expert  I watch a lot  I read a lot of news  And I have my own opinion  Well so I'm looking at him  I'm like  Wait a minute  It's Anthony  He took a Lamborghini out  And did 135 over the weekend  Why am I asking him  About politics  Had a hell of a weekend  Yeah we'll get into that  In a little bit  Really fast  The New York Post  On Sunday  Yesterday  Did a poll 
[00:11:30]  60% of Americans  Say they would vote  For a woman president  Where was that poll taken?  I don't know  It's in a newspaper  It's got to be official  The National Organization  Of Women rally  Maybe  That's what sucks  About these polls  And stats in general  They don't tell you  Where they were taken  If it was taken  In New York City  And you asked  A lot of women  Perhaps you would get  That kind of thing  Let's look at  Say a poll  That covers  The entire country 
[00:12:00]  Right  I don't see it  60%  Get out of here  Ready for this  62% say they would  Vote for an African  American president  They would  So basically  America is saying  They would have  A black president  Before a female president  But it's close  62%  60% to 60%  I don't believe it  I don't believe it  Huh?  Nobody wants to look ignorant  Yeah  No I wouldn't vote  For a black girl  Or yeah  Intolerant  Like  Well it depends on  How they did the poll too  Are you going to use  My real name in this  Will anyone know 
[00:12:30]  That I voted  How did they word it?  It's like  Would you vote  For a woman president  Stats and polls  If she was running  Against  Osama Bin Laden  Well  60% said yes  Yeah right  40% said I'd rather  Vote for Osama Bin Laden  Good point  Give us a little more  Info on this poll  That's a very good point  And by the way  I want a president  With a poll  That's my criteria  Someone brought up  On instant feedback  Someone on instant feedback 
[00:13:00]  Can you imagine  Hillary sitting  At the same desk  That Monica was under  That desk has to go  It's a historic desk  But she's got to  Look at it every day  And know Bill  Was propped against it  As shenanigans went on  In the Oval Office  She has to work  Right  In the very room  Right  Now hold on  Let's give this  A little thought  You walk in  Your husband  Is having sex  With another woman  In your bedroom 
[00:13:30]  Maybe the living room  On the couch  Something like that  And you find out about it  Do you ever look  At that room  The same way  Are you ever in that room  Not thinking  About that  Is the furniture  A reminder  Well Anthony  When it happened to me  Jesus  I'm just saying  It's like one of those things  Where you're absolutely right  She's going to sit  At that desk  And go  I'm the president  Of the  He got up  And then all of a sudden  She's nuking North Korea  Yeah  Because she gets all pissed off 
[00:14:00]  She sees a spot  On the rug  That they might have missed  She's taking a blacklight  Through the place  Looking for the stains  I haven't been able  To eat peanut butter  Or pet my dog  In five years  A blacklight  God  A blacklight  In the white  In the  Oval office  Would be amazing  But that's going to get her  Every time she walks in there  That's the room  Right  She's just starting  Tickling her leg  Under the desk  And she's only a long 
[00:14:30]  Black hair  That was under the desk  Oh this has been here a while  Oh no  Alright well  What else is America  Talking about this morning  Stop the Yard  What's the number one movie  Stop the Yard  Stop the Yard  Where you been  Holy crap  Stopping the Yard  That just goes to show you  That we're not going to have a  Well that means  We might have a black president  Well we might  If he makes a movie  Where he's stomping the yard  And when it comes to politics though 
[00:15:00]  I don't think a movie  About a black politician  Would do as well as  Stomp the Yard did  You know usually  After the Golden Globes  All those movies  Everyone goes out  In droves to see them  Yeah  Eh  Yeah  It's still about  Stomp the Yard  Dreamgirls got a lot of  A lot of talk  Because it won a  A few Golden Globe awards  It was number three  At the box office this week  Behind  A Night at the Museum  Ugh  And stomped the yard  13 mil  My brother's dream 
[00:15:30]  Yeah  He was supposed to be this  Not me  I'm going to sit out here  And act like I want to be here  You're the only thing  Your mama's got nothing  So you better make this  College boy thing work out  College boy  Who's that  That was not legit  What the hell are they doing  I don't know  They're stomping the yard  Where are you from  They're stomping the yard  Where are you from  Where are you from  Well  In a world where  Stomp the yard  I gather his brother 
[00:16:00]  Was the college kid  And this guy was like  Hip hop  Kind of  Break dance  I don't know  New style  Guy  And the brother  Something happened  Did he die  Did he get shot  That would be an odd thing  I'm not watching  Stomp the yard  See the educated  Going to college brother  Has to get shot  In these movies  Do you know  Oh god  Wait a minute  Sam 
[00:16:30]  Sam  Do you know  About  Stomp the yard  Where are you from  Where are you  Come on  Stomp the yard  Judging from the trailer  Yes  Chris Brown  Young R&B singer  Plays the younger brother  Who was seeming  To be a competitive dancer  Uh huh  And in some kind of scuffle  Got killed  Before he got the chance  To go to college  So his parents decided  To send his older brother  To college  His older brother  I think it's his older brother  Because it's all his mama had left  Right 
[00:17:00]  And what was the older brother  Into at this point  Dancing still  Oh  He was dancing  He just didn't get killed  Doing it  Oh okay  How did he get killed dancing  And it was some kind of  Real street  Like urban  Oh yeah  Like not what they're doing  Stomping a yard  No  In college  They don't know  About the street  Does he use his urban skills  Though to kind of  Like do well  Yes  Oh  See what happens is  Their school isn't  Quite good enough  To win  Is what I got  From the trailer  Yeah  But when they bring in 
[00:17:30]  This new kid  He knows  How to spice it up  With his street dancing  And  And  So  He like  Brings that part of it  To the school  And they go out  And I'm sure  Just stomp the hell  Out of that yard  But the thing is  He's kind of a loner  Oh no  So the whole frat life  Doesn't appeal to him  At first  Of course  Ew  That's whack  But then  He picks up  Some marshmallows  And  He turns them  All around  Does he not 
[00:18:00]  Fit in at first  Is that what happens  No not at first  It's just not his thing  What's he gonna do  I think  Finally  Something happens  Where  He's befriended  And befriends  These people  And they look at him  And respect his form of dancing  Because initially  They don't have any respect  For him  Because he's from the street  You have to be trained  At this school  Oh  And then  Did you even know  This was going on  Is it going on  Rotten Tomatoes  Gives it  25% good ratings  Does it  Where are you from  You

[00:30:30]  This ended at I think  Midnight last night  You have your arch rival here  The Colts and the Patriots  So much  To exercise here  In one night  And to do it  Coming back from  Eighteen down  And they finish it though  I don't even think  Peyton's gonna watch  Intercepted  Colts are going to the Super Bowl  Oops  There you go 
[00:31:00]  That's good  That's some excitement  Yeah there was some excitement  At the end of that game  And then  Peyton took a knee  And that was it  Be funny if you made that call  In the first quarter  Yeah  What  Yeah the Bears  Were in the Super Bowl  In 85 of course  Getting the stats now  And the Colts  1970  Wow  Against the Jets right  I want to say Dallas  Unless they played  Before that  I thought they  I thought they played  The Cowboys  I can't wait  Until they do one of those  Oh wait  How could it be the

[00:33:00]  It is too good  It's pretty amazing  To just be coincidence  I haven't picked a winner  Maybe the listeners know  The last time I picked a winner  But it's been a while  Others are suggesting  That if  Opie  And then Fez  From the Ron and Fez show  Right  If Fez picks  The Bears  Then just  Sell your house  Sell your car  Everything  Take that money  Put it on the Colts  And you'll be able to buy  Mansions  Yachts  And the best of things 
[00:33:30]  Oh  Yeah  Yeah  We are the Bears  Shuffling the group  Shuffling all down  We're doing it for you  We're so bad  We know we're good  We're on your mind  Like when you guys would  You know we're tough  Struggling for fun  Slending our stuff  For everyone  We're not here  Oh boy 
[00:34:00]  They're just there  To do the Super Bowl shuffle  What's the problem?  It's a great song  By the way  John from Buffalo  Opie  What the hell do you expect?  The Bears were up by 30 points  I know it was a blowout  And then he writes  How much enthusiasm  Do you expect Buck to have?  I don't know  It's the end of the game  And it's official  That the Bears  Are going to the Super Bowl  For the first time  It didn't matter  If it was a blowout  In 22 years  You would expect  Just a little more excitement  Just a little  I mean he's a professional  Come up with something  Just how about it  And there it is 
[00:34:30]  And the guy just  When the guy from the Colts  Made the interception  On Brady  He just fell to the ground  Which was smart  Right  Don't fumble  Or do something stupid  It was a great game  Just going back and forth  After the Colts  Made that comeback  And then they were trading  Points  You know  Back and forth  And then of course  Yeah  The interception  To seal the deal  For the Colts  Steven from Bayshore  Joe Buck's summation  Was basically  By the way  The Bears win  Thank you  And good night  Yeah  We're done  He just wanted to go eat  Let's say hi to somebody 
[00:35:00]  They don't have their name  On the phones here  But he's from Chicago  What's up Chicago?  Yeah this is Chester Zash  Just from Chicago  What's up guys?  Hey Chester  What's up?  First off  I want to just say  Thanks to Jimmy  For coming out to Chicago  This weekend  He put on an excellent show  Excellent material  He was kind enough  To sign a bunch of  Wow stickers  For the past  After the show too  Me and another  Dead Ben  Passed out about  300 wow stickers  So we're getting  The word out in Chicago  About the show  Thank you sir  Jimmy's very cordial  To the listeners 
[00:35:30]  Jimmy came back  He's like  You know  With his comedy  He's an ambassador  And he was in Chicago  And he came back  With some good news  He's saying  That you know  The show's catching on  In Chicago  Yeah when we were  Passing out  When we were passing out  Wow stickers  People were just like  Oh man I've been looking  For one of these  Thanks a lot  You know  So glad to get them  To people  Thanks man  Yeah it was great  Chicago was great dude  It was just a fun weekend  And the fans were out  I mean every show was mobbed  Three out of the five  Was sold out  And the other two were great  It's like  There's definitely people listening  I know there's people listening  Absolutely  You know it 
[00:36:00]  They were there  I saw them  And they were all saying  That they loved the show  And it was  You know  It's like you can always tell  When you go out  If there's any kind of a vibe  From the city  And you know  Steve Dahl was very cool man  People on WhackBerry  Go well how come Steve Dahl  Was asking about  Calling it the virus  And breaking your body  It's like  He's a dry sense of humor  That's what he has  He's just busting your chops  He's very supportive of the show  And they all want the show to work  I had to do the sales lunch  At that  Oh god  No  No  It was completely unawkward  Stop it  You're such a liar  Doesn't that stink  Drew walked in and pep talked 
[00:36:30]  And here he is  And last time I saw him  And I was like  You know  We gotta explain it for the rest of America  We never even have gone over this one  We've been through a million of these  We'll tear away the curtain  Give you a little peek inside our radio  When we're not on the air  There are certain things called these sales like meetings  And the on-air personalities go in  And meet with the staff  We do this at the new affiliates  If we're ever there  We go in and meet with the sales staff 
[00:37:00]  Some people just come in  Shake your hand in the studio  And other stations set up this big to-do thing  It's conference room  Was it conference room?  Yes  They're all sitting around the big conference table  Big huge long table  But don't go in yet  Hold on  You gotta make your big entrance  So we've been through so many of these  The door opens  And we walk in  And they start clapping  And you stand there like an idiot  And you gotta deliver some kind of speech 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, some kind of speech about  It's a rah-rah speech  Yeah  You know  Like you're Newt Rockne all of a sudden  You know  With my dick jokes  I think we can take  Take this station to the next level  Let me tell you  For up, for up, for up  Things weren't too good for a while  Here at this station  But with our show  We plan on bringing in some numbers  So you can tell the station  At, at, at, at, at, at, at, at, at, at, at  That's Hillary Clinton 
[00:38:00]  That's what it is  That's how she does her speeches  And that's what it's all about.  And then they ask you little questions.  Hey, or not even about sales.  It usually turns into, hey, that bitch you did.  Or, you know, I listened to, God, I remember like a year ago.  It's nothing.  You learn nothing.  They learn nothing.  They don't want to be there.  No.  You don't want to be there.  No.  You just want to do your radio show.  It was the GM standing there with his arms crossed, all proud-looking, smiling, assessing the situation. 
[00:38:30]  He's actually a pretty, Drew, right?  He's the GM.  Drew rocks.  Yeah, he's great.  Drew, yeah, the general manager at WCKG in Chicago.  He rocks.  He's all right, man.  But it's the same crap you have to, well, you know, we're a show that relates to guys.  And we talk about what guys like, which is lifestyle and old sex.  And we like to get edgy and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I think if you can't sell that, you can't sell anything.  I'll tell you something. 
[00:39:00]  When it gets a little nice, I want to go to Chicago.  But I don't want to sit in meetings.  I want to see the city.  That's what I want.  I want someone that knows the city, takes us around, because I've never been there.  And I want to see the city.  I don't want to sit in dopey meetings.  Period.  Thank you.  All right.  The Midday Show brought me food.  They did.  Dan and Terry.  That's nice.  They're African-American gentlemen.  Nice.  They're very nice guys.  And I'm in the middle of a meeting, and I'm eating a salad, an awful salad in this sales 
[00:39:30]  meeting.  And then they just walk in.  He went with a homemade thing of rice and beans.  How pleasant.  The inside is a Tupperware.  You're pulled Tupperware off, and the inside is sweating on the top.  It was actually very good.  I was like, I don't want to eat this.  But then I didn't.  It was actually very tasty.  All right.  Let's go to James in New Hampshire.  James, what's up?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning, James.  How are you today? 
[00:40:00]  Not so good with the Pats loss, but I'm just thinking in honor of our first Super Bowl with  two black coaches, we need to find out what to do when my baby is black.  Oh, right.  Yeah, by the way, we could check that one off.  Now we've got a Super Bowl with two black coaches.  There is no way.  And it's unbelievable how they have to keep track of everything that a black person does.  Yeah.  You know, this is the first time that two black coaches will be coaching in the Super Bowl. 
[00:40:30]  It really is insulting to black people, I would think.  Like, you don't have to bring it up every time a black person makes an accomplishment or  something.  Yeah, the two head coaches are black.  So who gives us?  Who gives us?  Who gives us one of those?  Exactly.  Cursing potty mouth, you.  But there's another one they could check off, I guess.  I don't really get that myself. 
[00:41:00]  Checklist.  Well, there's one you're not going to be checking off anytime soon.  No, I don't see that happening.  But hey, who knows?  Obama!  No.  That's the only one they want to check off.  Who are you kidding?  Yeah, that's the biggie.  That's the big check.  Once that's checked off, all the other ones fall into place.  All the other ones don't mean crap.  All right.  Oh, really fast, because we're talking about football. 
[00:41:30]  We like to just breathe on the show.  Who's laughing at him?  A fan.  What's wrong, fan?  I hate Manny head.  Just breathing.  Fan's laughing because he's like, oh crap, they're not in control.  It had to be a second and a half of dead air while they took a breath and maybe a swig  of water or something.  Wife induces labor so husband can go to the Bears game.  Nine months.  That's nice.  Nine months pregnant and married to a Bears fan.  A fervent, a fervent Bears fan.  He could have done it with a Doc Martin.  Here, I'm inducing labor. 
[00:42:00]  Thud.  Why can't they say like a Bears fan?  It has to be a fervent.  Fervent.  A fervent.  The stupid paper is using words that are like, all right, we get it.  You're smart.  Nine months pregnant and married to a fervent Bears fan with tickets to Sunday's big game,  the NFC Championship game.  Colleen Pavelka didn't want to risk going into labor during the game against the Saints.  Due to give birth on Monday, Pavelka's doctor told her Friday she could induce labor early.  She opted for the Friday delivery to take care of her husband. 
[00:42:30]  That's nice.  I thought, how could Mark miss this one opportunity that he might never have again in his life?  While her husband watched the Bears play the Saints at Soldier's Field Sunday,  Colleen planned to watch in the hospital with the baby wrapped in a Bears blanket.  A Christmas gift from his grandmother.  She knew what was good for her.  Her and the baby, both with little black eyes.  They didn't do the...  Do the right thing.  The right thing, of course.  Where does the line cross, though, from just being a dedicated fan to,  you should be shot. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, that really is a little much.  What asses.  Induced labor.  There's a game.  Can't we just let the baby come out naturally?  A bunch of guys are throwing a ball with helmets,  and you're worried about the birth of your child,  and it's like, I care about these guys.  It's on television.  Silly.  And it looks better than being there.  There's been athletes that have blown off really important games  because their wife is having a baby.  Yeah, yeah.  They'd rather be with the wife and baby than at the game. 
[00:43:30]  Right.  And they play in the game.  All right.  Onwards and upwards.  Can you do more Hillary today?  No.  What is a...  I can't because I'm busy checking out  if people will vote for me for president of the United States.  Now, is she running, or is this an exploratory...  They all do exploratory things.  Is she past exploratory but not officially a candidate?  Where is she at?  She has thrown her vagina into the ring. 
[00:44:00]  If we can, you know, use everything, race, and just thrown it in.  She's in.  This is it.  It doesn't...  But they set up these exploratory committees  so they can start raising money immediately.  All right.  So that's what they're doing.  But they're in.  Obama's in.  The Mexican guy is in.  Senor Swanky.  That's it.  But the Democratic, like, primaries are always such a goof. 
[00:44:30]  It's just this cluster F.  They don't...  There's no unity.  Even after they pick a candidate,  the other ones still hold grudges.  Like, the Republicans, for the most part...  Are you nuts?  They both do that.  Oh, but the Republicans, for the most part, whip their guys into shape.  It's like, you know, you lost the primary to this guy.  Here's our guy.  Don't be bad-mouthing him.  Just support him and shut up.  But Democrats support after they drop out.  They can't.  They're too diversified. 
[00:45:00]  See, Obama has the black vote.  That's how it's going to work.  He's got the black vote.  He's got some of the white vote, too, of course.  But he's got the black vote.  So, if Hillary gets the nomination for Democrat,  the black vote goes away.  Because Obama...  He'll go, yeah, let's vote for Hillary.  But it'll be like, I ain't voting for no Hillary.  Hillary's going to get a lot of black votes.  I want Obama.  Are you kidding?  Oh, she will?  No, she will.  But not as many as Obama would get.  You know, President Clinton was our first black... 
[00:45:30]  Oh, shut up!  Was he?  You've heard that joke a million times, too.  We already had our first black president.  It was Hillary Clinton.  It was President Clinton.  Was it?  Was it?  All right, can we take a break?  Let us do that.  Then we shall return with more.  How much do you think Paul McCartney is going to settle for?  It's in the news today.  There's already a price, right?  Yep.  Yep.  Let me just pull this out of the hat here. 
[00:46:00]  I'd say $150,000.  Perhaps a little more than that, Anthony.  And also, you are guilty, sir.  What did I do?  I'm trying to wreck the Opie and Anthony show.  What did I do?  You are guilty, sir.  I did nothing wrong.  I was blaming someone else, but I think you are the guilty party.  I know.  It was you, Anthony Cumia.  I know it can't be me.  You.  It doesn't have anything to do with your backpack, does it? 
[00:46:30]  It was you, sir.  Oh, yeah.  That was just a treat last night.  That wasn't me?  No.  No.  I'm trying to think.  What did I do?  No.  We'll get into what fell out of Greg Opie Hughes' backpack last night.  The actor that plays Opie.  That's right.  As I was going to bed last night.  Oh, we just laughed and laughed and laughed at home.  Someone is pulling a fine scam around here.  Shenanigans are going on.  Yeah.  Shenanigans.  Yeah.  These guys are doing all sorts of shenanigans behind the scenes.  What fell out of your backpack?  Oh, boy.  Is that a good radio tease, isn't it? 
[00:47:00]  Is it a muffin?  I don't know how I ruined the show.  You ruined the show, and I blame somebody else.  Okay.  Something embarrassing fell out of my backpack.  And, Jimmy, what about you?  Tease something.  I put something in Opie's backpack.  Was it you?  Really?  No.  I want to get to the bottom of it.  He doesn't even know what it is.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Call the Opie and Anthony Show right now.  866-313-FREE. 
[00:47:30]  O&A, who's this?  It's Opie and Anthony.  What do you got for the show?  Nothing.  So, why'd you call?  The Lummy.  If you have a point that's relevant to the topic at hand, call the Opie and Anthony Show  at 866-313-FREE.  Hello?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Virus.  Yes, yes, yes. 
[00:48:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, thanks for checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Phones are lit today, but if you're trying to get through, 1-866-313-FREE.  We got lots to cover still today.  What are you laughing at over there?  Ah, just pal talk.  Yeah.  If, you know, I should just bounce this guy.  If you're going to call yourself Pretty Ricky,  people are going to think you're a girl and pop your window up and be very disappointed. 
[00:48:30]  I thought perhaps it was a girl, so I pop it up.  I don't like staring at guys.  I'm staring at guys in the studio.  So, you know, there are the ladies of pal talk that are usually displayed.  Yeah, but if we were nude, you'd have no problem staring at us, you freak.  Well, you know.  No.  So, uh, I open up a browser, Pretty Ricky, and it's a guy. 
[00:49:00]  What the hell's wrong with you?  Browser gets shut off.  Why is he calling himself Pretty?  I don't know.  You know something?  Don't ban him.  Just let him be.  I'm not banning him.  He doesn't know what he's doing.  No, don't do any of that.  He doesn't know what he's doing.  He's gone for the day.  No, don't do it to him.  He's gone for the day.  Poor kid.  All right, I'll let him back in.  He's confused about his sexuality.  The least he could do is let him hang out and pal talk.  All right, I removed the bounce. 
[00:49:30]  There.  All right.  All right.  Oh, John and Jeff, they're just terrific.  They're on before us.  Not at all.  What show are you talking about?  John and Jeff.  Oh.  They're just terrific.  It's a scream.  I was lucky.  Literally, you screamed.  I was lucky today when I had to do my thing.  Yeah.  They were in commercial break.  When you had to take care of your business that you do every morning, like clockwork.  I was able to relax this morning in there.  And then I got locked in because the handle broke.  And no one cared. 
[00:50:00]  No one came to get me.  I'm just sitting there whistling and stuff.  It was worse than saw.  Obi was locked in the bathroom.  The handle fell off.  And that awful show was on.  He'd rather cut his arm off than listen.  I just started sweating.  I'm like, they're going to know I'm in here eventually.  Hopefully, before John and Jeff come back from a commercial break.  They're awful.  Obi, John and Jeff are on.  And the handle is now off the bathroom door. 
[00:50:30]  You have two choices.  You can break the mirror and slice your own throat or listen to John and Jeff.  I'll cut my own throat.  We can't get enough of the awfulness that is John and Jeff, by the way.  That's how they get listeners.  Me and Florentine would drive around at night because they were on a satellite radio simulcast.  And we could not stop listening.  We're not sure, still, if this is a bit or they're serious.  Because we can't comprehend this show being a serious show. 
[00:51:00]  They're on before us in New York.  I think they're on before us in Chicago and a couple other cities.  But they're out of L.A. and they're just terrific.  What was the John and Jeff bit of the day today there, E-Rock?  This morning they were discussing unionizing people who check out in supermarkets.  And they were doing the pros and cons, one versus the other.  One guy was for unions.  He grew up in a union household.  The other guy was saying, how much talent does it take to put stuff in a bag? 
[00:51:30]  They want to start a union as part of the...  Wait, wait, wait.  Sorry, totally not at all.  Cash registers or the people you meet after you're paying your food bill?  The cashiers out of California, they want to start a union.  Uh-huh.  And they were arguing the pros and cons of starting a union for cash.  Did one take one side and one take the other?  Yes, they did.  Wow.  This went on for two hours.  That's fodder for chat.  Two hours. 
[00:52:00]  Well, can we hear a John and Jeff promo?  They're just the greatest thing.  Yeah, we love their promos.  Here we go.  Due to the mature and graphic subject matter, viewer discretion is advised.  The John and Jeff show.  We're two guys who think poor people cannot afford to have kids.  We're two guys who wonder what happened to the service in customer service.  We're two guys who think shoplifters should be caged like animals in full view of customers.  The John and Jeff show.  The John and Jeff show.  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body. 
[00:52:30]  We can freeze his head.  We're two guys.  Yes.  Wow.  Well, maybe, you know, maybe they fell short with that promo.  I know I said cash registers instead of cashiers.  They want to start a union. 
[00:53:00]  Union has the cash registers.  I know.  Cash registers.  People have to wash their hands before they touch our buttons.  Holding picket signs in their little drawer mouths.  Rawr, rawr, rawr, rawr, rawr, rawr, rawr.  We want, we need better pay.  I'm like, thank God these two in front of me, they just don't listen in general.  I was getting away with that one until instant feedback jumped on.  Oh, they won't let you get away.  All right.  Anyway, let's get another John and Jeff promo out there for everybody. 
[00:53:30]  The John and Jeff show.  The John and Jeff show.  We're two guys who think there should be a federal investigation into the long lines at the post office.  We're two guys who think it should be a felony if your french fries are cold at the drive-thru.  We're two guys who think a woman should give a man a gift after getting engaged.  The John and Jeff show.  The John and Jeff show.  Is this real or are they doing a mock show?  Yeah, we can't figure it out.  How about we're two guys that are not permitted to marry in every state. 
[00:54:00]  We're two guys that are fighting to adopt children together.  Wow.  Am I the only one that picks it up, especially in the one voice?  Well, listeners have picked it up.  I was talking about a show I was listening to driving in the other morning and a garbage truck driver called and said,  Look, I listen to you guys, but I think you're all gay.  And they went, hey, now, you know, I'm married.  One guy's married and the other guy likes Asian girls.  He likes to go to Thailand. 
[00:54:30]  But we found out he flies solo to Thailand.  And there's pictures up on the web of him with some Thailand girls.  Now, Jimmy, you know what?  Unfortunately, Jimmy was not here when we really needed him.  I know.  Go to the go to the picture of him in the bar.  Get that picture of him with this girl.  Jimmy, are these local women out on a out just having a few drinks for a happy hour after after a tough day at the office?  Or are these underage prostitutes? 
[00:55:00]  That picture has KidToucher written all over it.  What do you think?  Seriously, don't even go for the goof.  Of course, that's probably a prostitute.  You can tell, by the way, he affectionately has his arm.  He's a creep.  He looks like the guy they hauled back from there.  He looks like John Carr.  Or E-Rock in 15 years.  The man's an ass.  And he's wearing an awful red shirt.  And he has his arm around her waist.  And the telltale sign is she has both arms in front of her.  Like, she's so used to this. 
[00:55:30]  It's uncomfortable.  She's used to having a strange American.  She doesn't want any affection.  She just wants to, you know, pay her phone bill.  She has a waist that's about as big as your arm.  Right.  She's got barely any rest to speak of.  Look at the rest of the bar.  It's just filled with just young girls.  This guy.  I mean, nothing wrong with that.  But he's making this look like he just happened to be at a local bar in Thailand.  Yeah, a strip club.  Apparently, he likes going to Thailand.  And, again, we've said it before. 
[00:56:00]  If you're a guy and you're flying solo to Thailand, you're into some stuff.  Yeah.  And you know what?  This picture might be on the website to throw everyone off the track.  Sure.  Off the...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Look at her neck.  It almost looks like she has what could be an Adam's apple for the side.  I'm not saying she's a tranny.  Dare to dream, Jimmy.  Well, in Thailand, the Asian trannies are notoriously convincing.  That could absolutely be...  This picture is to throw everyone off the scent, if you know what I mean.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Of what?  Something worse?  Really? 
[00:56:30]  Oh, you think the other way.  Boys.  I'm just saying, I don't know.  I don't know anything about...  I don't know either.  I don't know anything about John's life there, so...  Are you guessing, though, that if that picture were accurate, his date would be propped up  on his shoulder and they'd both be wearing baseball hats and waving?  Yes.  We met in the big brother picture.  Show him another picture.  Jim's an expert on this.  Yeah.  Show him, yeah, like that picture.  Show him exhibit A.  This is more pictures from the John and Jeff website. 
[00:57:00]  Him in a bar in Thailand.  Apparently, they're getting a lot of hits right now.  Yeah, they're...  You dumb listeners, let us do our job!  Let's do our job!  Why are we helping this program?  Personally, I think that those are just...  They're not local girls, just front photos.  They're for fronts.  Fronts.  What do you mean?  Like keeping a picture of kids that aren't yours in your thing on your office desk.  You look like a family man.  I think that's more like just so people think, wow, he went out and met some chicks.  Yeah, yeah.  Did you?  When you know what you're going to Thailand for.  Of course. 
[00:57:30]  But let's make it perfectly clear.  We have no effing idea what John does in Thailand.  I have no idea, but I guarantee you this.  He would not let anybody look at his laptop.  I guarantee you that hard drive is rigged with explosives.  It's like all he has to do, he carries around on his key fob with his remote to open his car doors.  Anywhere he is in the country, he can hit it and his hard drive explodes.  It's one lousy key, the period key.  If you hit that, it's over, Johnny. 
[00:58:00]  A whole hard drive fries.  Yes, officer?  What is this file here?  13 underscore.  Oh, don't touch that.  Underscore.  Hey, can we hear another John and Jeff promo?  This show is just terrific.  We listen to it every morning, getting ready for the Opie and Anthony show.  Here's another promo for the John and Jeff show.  The John and Jeff show.  We're two guys who think women who keep their maiden names in marriage are high maintenance.  We're two guys who think DNA should be mandatory before a man's name goes on a birth certificate. 
[00:58:30]  We're two guys who think nobody should get married before the age of 30.  The John and Jeff show.  The John and Jeff show.  Jimmy, are you high maintenance?  Anyone that says that first M in maintenance should have their face slapped.  Maintenance.  Maintenance.  Well, they know what two guys should be about.  We're two guys that think a flight to Thailand is much too long. 
[00:59:00]  We're two guys that think the age of consent should be nine.  Creeps.  Well, I don't like the way they're trying to be boys.  Like, this is what annoys me.  It's like, we're two guys that think you shouldn't be married before you're 30.  It's like, you L.A. idiot.  That's your idea of being like maverick men?  Right.  You know?  Yeah, they're right on the edge.  We're two guys that think you should high five instead of shaking hands.  Oh, God.  Stop it.  Keep them away from the wheel.  Calm down.  Nuts.  That's your New Year's Eve, like, pal. 
[00:59:30]  And that just means they're getting married because it's the thing to do instead of maybe you're married to someone you really, really are into that's a hot piece of ass and giving you everything you want and you have a very healthy relationship.  Right.  They're basically saying, ah, got to get married eventually because it's the thing to do.  Time's ticking.  All right.  Well, we're two guys as well.  We want to follow the lead of the John and Jeff program.  And Steve and his crack staff came up with this.  I bet it sounds just like their promo. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, it's exactly like their promo, Jimmy.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Two guys who think that your fat ass is the reason that no one loves you and no one ever will.  Two guys who think that if your kid has a birth defect, you should burn it and start over.  Two guys who better have supper waiting for them when they get home or else.  Two guys.  We think. 
[01:00:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Of course Steve has to hit a woman in a promo.  Oh, excellent Steve.  It's so refreshing to hear that again.  Can you do one show promo where you're not hitting a woman, please?  Just one.  The women want to love this show.  I know they do.  Wait, this coming from the guy that did an hour-long break on, what was it called?  What?  The thing.  What?  What?  What were you guys talking about on Friday?  What?  What?  There was an hour-long break.  What?  You got them all.  What?  What?  On misogynistic.  What?  There was that term. 
[01:01:00]  What?  The Guido Slap.  What was it?  Oh, Goon Hand.  Goon Hand.  Goon Hand.  The Goon Hand.  It was an hour-long break.  I'm talking about how sometimes, you know, he goes, I wouldn't hit it, woman, but sometimes  you got to give her the Goon Hand.  It's where you just grab her a little bit of fat under her arm and muscle it around and  say, stop making a scene.  Because sometimes you got to Goon Hand her.  Goon Hand.  How great is that?  It leaves four little bruises on one side and one big one on the inside.  Yeah.  Someone should Goon Hand bobs on the next time he grabs for Lay's potato chips. 
[01:01:30]  What if that term is different in black relationships?  Listen to the replay.  I made the joke.  It's got a bell and everything.  I should have had more faith.  Of course.  Ah, well.  Steve, you got to make a couple more of those.  I certainly will.  So there you go.  We can't get enough of John and Jeff on here before us in New York City.  We would listen to them.  You could not listen to them.  You can't.  Like, this is not two guys who really think they're being funny and entertaining. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've listened and thought it was a goof.  But then you realize day after day that they're doing the same thing.  No bit lasts this long.  Not even one of ours.  And it's serious.  And it's become a thing every morning where I have to go in that bathroom and they're piping the John and Jeff show in.  And I got to take care of what I got to take care of.  And it's just awful.  Here's an actual conversation I heard a little bit of when I was driving in.  They were doing their self-help thing or help line where people call in. 
[01:02:30]  And they give them a little help.  They're in sticky situations.  And they help out with their knowledge.  And it's serious.  So this woman called up and said she was breaking up from her boyfriend or husband or something, some kind of divorce or breakup.  They lived together.  But they were still living together.  They were broken up.  Yet for the time being, still living together.  So one of them said, that must be a little awkward when either one of you bring somebody, a guy or a girl home.  And the other guy said, hey, hey, that's getting a little personal. 
[01:03:00]  Let's stick to the subject at hand and wasn't kidding and didn't get punched in the face by the other guy.  And then they just continued talking about relationships and how that should be handled.  I was stunned.  What question was a little personal?  I missed it.  Was it when he said, how old was your date in Thailand?  Yeah.  Now, hey, that's a little personal.  Ten.  Oh, what creeps.  We're still waiting, by the way, for one person to call up and tell us that they went to Thailand for something legit. 
[01:03:30]  One lousy person out there.  I told you.  We're not going to find one.  We're not going to find one.  There's one other reason.  If you're the representative for sales for a novelty shop that buys rubber dog doo, that's the only reason you fly to Thailand.  You go to the warehouse, you look and go, this is some of the best rubber dog poop I've ever seen in my life. 
[01:04:00]  Give me 20 plane loads.  I'm going to get a raise.  Or you're a wicker salesman.  Wicker.  We decided.  Hi, I'm with Pier One Imports.  Right.  And we're looking for wicker.  I hear you make it.  And I want to have sex with somebody underage.  Can you rig that up?  Because they're probably doing it, too.  All right.  That's not a breath. 
[01:04:30]  What happened?  Earlier we said, you know, it's taking a breath.  That's smacking your lips.  I know.  I want to try it out on the air.  It doesn't work.  No.  It won't go over with the listeners.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  I guess it's hoodie day on Pal Talk.  All the girls are wearing their hoodies today.  I got one, two, three, four girls up.  Not one of them has a hoodie on. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, yeah?  What are you looking at?  You don't see happy typing girl with her hood on?  What about French bread pizza?  Oh, their hoodies aren't up.  Right.  Okay.  No, they were up.  Then they're down.  But now they're back up.  See?  They start little trends in the morning.  Sometimes they go with a wacky hat.  Today it's all about the hoodies on Pal Talk.  Lisa Ann there.  Huh?  She's a girl that I never saw before.  I don't know.  She's kind of new to the collection.  Jimmy was commenting, hi, Lisa Ann. 
[01:05:30]  She's, yeah, now their hoodies are being pulled up.  By the way, the phones are lit with people trying to defend why they go to Thailand.  Because I'm sure they got spouses listening to the show.  Oh, wait.  Let's see if this girl has her hoodie up.  Pretty Ricky.  Let me pop that window up.  Oh, that's right.  It's a guy.  I let him back in, by the way.  All right.  Nice.  I'm nice.  All right.  We need some rulings.  All right.  This guy goes to Thailand because he works for the airline. 
[01:06:00]  Well, do you get off the plane?  If you step off the aircraft.  All right.  Let me ask real fast.  Then you're a kid toucher.  Sir?  Sir?  Hello.  Hello, I got you.  You go to Thailand because you work for the airlines?  Yeah.  I don't anymore.  I quit the airlines.  But we used to go.  What happens is a mechanic would have to fly with the aircraft.  Yeah.  And it would stay on the ground for about 12 hours and you'd do routine checks on the plane  and they would put you up in a resort. 
[01:06:30]  So you're off the plane in Thailand, right?  Off the plane in Thailand.  Pedophile!  Kid toucher.  Moving on.  Let's go to Joe in New York.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Listen, I was in the Marines from 90 to 96.  All right.  We went to Thailand in 1993.  We got four days of liberty and Patty at beach.  And, you know, everybody gets off the ship.  Everybody gets lit.  Well, we find one of our buddies, Jeremy, in a bar and he's making out with this apparently 
[01:07:00]  young lady and we're looking at her neck and she's got an Adam's apple the size of  a peach pit.  And we're like, you know, Jeremy, why don't you check under her trunk before you go any  further?  Sure enough, he reaches under her skirt and he's holding a tree trunk, man.  Wow.  Please tell me y'all shot her and dragged her out and buried her somewhere.  They call them Benny boys over there and a lot of them are convincing looking.  I mean, really, really got to look close or check under their skirt, man.  And that's where Sirius goes to get their employees. 
[01:07:30]  So thank you.  A little inside joke.  All right.  Let's go to Paula from Connecticut.  Paula.  Hello.  Good morning.  Good morning.  First of all, I want to say I love your show.  All right.  Well, thank you.  That means you've got a problem with us.  That's how it always starts.  First, I want to tell you, I really do enjoy what you do.  But.  I want to have Jimmy's baby.  Okay.  Never mind.  I went to Thailand about 15 years ago.  You what? 
[01:08:00]  I went to Thailand about 15 years ago.  Yeah.  For what reason?  Well, my ex-husband was in the military and I went over there and met the submarine that  he was on.  And we had two days there.  And let me tell you, it was something.  Wow.  I'm serious.  We got lots of tie sticks when we were there.  Ah.  Okay.  So drugs.  So yeah, we got a lot of that.  Don't do that anymore.  But yeah, we went to the sex clubs, my husband and I, and they're like 12 and 13 year olds  doing sex acts and having a good, you know, it was pretty common over there.  Yeah.  Absolutely. 
[01:08:30]  So military seems to be maybe be an excuse to be there.  I think there's shenanigans going on anyway.  Of course.  All right.  Hooker's, though.  Hey, do we have Thailand's exports?  Yeah.  I have no idea.  What is Thailand?  Well, they're into.  Some of the products they make.  Well, they got rice, textiles, footwear.  Textiles.  What are textiles?  That is so vague.  I picture textiles being like big things of wool.  Like just a big square block of wool. 
[01:09:00]  Here, we're exporting this.  Call it a textile.  I don't know.  I learned about it in school.  They're exports.  Everyone exports textiles, by the way.  Every country.  When I was going to school, what are their exports?  Well, there's textiles.  Yeah.  Textiles.  Textiles.  It sounds so, I don't know, important.  It sounds like an important export.  It's fake duty.  Why export it when every country has them?  Just keep your own textiles, could you?  If they have textiles and we have textiles, why are two ships passing each other going in 
[01:09:30]  opposite directions, both carrying textiles?  Why didn't they stay where they were?  Thank you, Brian Regan.  See, that's his lager joke that we reworked for this part of the program.  Our textile bit.  What else?  Footwear, fishery products.  Fishery?  Rubber, jewelry, and electrical appliances.  You know everything is crap, though. 
[01:10:00]  It's not like fishing equipment.  It's a stick with a string on it and a homemade hook.  Hey, here's Joe from New York.  He's gone to Thailand on vacation four or five times.  Four or five times.  There's another guy calling up, but he didn't want to wait for the break.  He says the reason a lot of people go to Thailand, bird watching.  What?  Oh, sure.  Exactly.  I'm sure they do.  Joe.  Yeah.  What's up?  Oh, hey.  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  Hey, listen.  I'll tell you the story quick.  I've been to Thailand probably about four or five times. 
[01:10:30]  I've always been with girlfriends or my wife.  I took my wife.  But on a serious note, there's a lot of good stuff there in terms of vacation.  Like the food kicks ass.  And if you're into backpacking, it's great.  Backpacking.  Yeah, there's a certain type of backpacking that they do.  No offense, Joe, but come on.  Listen, I got a story for you.  Go to the Adirondacks if you want to backpack.  Yeah, no kidding.  If you want to Thailand.  The great part about backpacking in Thailand, there's nude boys all over the place. 
[01:11:00]  Go ahead, Doug.  Let me tell you the story or what?  Oh, hey.  All right.  All right.  It's the Joe show.  All right.  You ready?  Yeah, go ahead, Joe.  All right.  Let's hear your story.  All right.  Here it goes.  The first time I went.  Eric, what's going on today?  Teach him a lesson.  Absolutely.  Let him start his story and then bam.  Eric, why do you go to Thailand?  I go there about once a year.  I try to go twice a year, actually, for fights, Muay Thai tournaments. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  I've been going for about six or seven years now.  Really?  It's a pretty good time.  I like going over there.  Competition's pretty good and the exposure's pretty good if you're trying to make it professional  in fighting.  And that's the reason you go to Thailand, right?  That's the reason I go.  All right.  Well, there are reasons.  You know what's great about all these phone calls?  There's like a guilt associated with the reason why they go to Thailand.  Hey, this is why I go.  Hey, hey.  I know what you're talking about.  I see it myself.  But I strictly go for some hand-to-hand combat. 
[01:12:00]  Eric, do you feel a little odd when you go, like when you're going through customs,  that people are kind of looking at you weird?  Well, there's an awful lot of American men walking around with young Thai boys.  That's what bothers me.  Really?  Yeah, unfortunately.  It's right in the open, right?  Well, it's tough to tell sometimes that they're walking around with young boys and young girls  because they all kind of look the same.  Yeah.  How long of a flight is it?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  It's long.  It's like 13 hours.  We did a whole bit on Friday about, you know, the pedophiles are going over there. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, that must be the longest flight ever.  And they're on that long flight.  They're all worked up into a frenzy.  They're frothing.  They're frothing at the mouth.  Just going, how long have we been?  15 minutes in the air.  What did we say?  The guy has his carry-on luggage on his lap.  He's just sitting there waiting.  Sir, we just took off.  We still have 12 and a half hours to go.  I'll hold this.  Thank you.  Miss, when will we be landing?  Shortly?  We're still on the taxiway here at LAX. 
[01:13:00]  Damn it.  All right, Eric.  Thanks.  Just can't wait.  Oh, like a kid waiting to go to Disney.  Archie, when?  When is it?  Well, we're not going until Easter break.  It's too long.  When?  Creeps.  Just creepy guys.  Why do they get busted, right?  Because they're computers and they're coming back over.  Why don't they just mail the porn home?  Well, they're really taking that.  You put porno through the mail, you get in trouble. 
[01:13:30]  And I'm thinking if you're sending a package from Thailand to your house after being in Thailand,  it could be perhaps a problem.  I think if the government is checking your mail, I think they're checking stuff coming from the Middle East and Thailand.  Yeah, Thailand too.  That's about it.  So give us a call if you go to Thailand and tell us why you go there, why you have to, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, go to Thailand.  By the way, the New York Post today, just a terrific political cartoon, everybody. 
[01:14:00]  You want to take out your workbooks?  It's just terrific.  Which paper?  The New York Post, page six, you know, they do a little political cartoon or a cartoon that has something to do with a hot topic.  Hot topic.  Hot topic.  Hot.  I can't get past the Christina Aguilera picture.  Yeah, no kidding.  Can she take a bad picture of this girl?  Jesus Christ.  No kidding.  She's like the photographer's sweetheart.  They don't look for her in a bad pose or picture.  You know, like Hillary Clinton, they always try to catch her with her eyes open real wide and her mouth open, like, wow! 
[01:14:30]  Like, that's how, it looks like she's going, holy Jesus!  In every picture.  They always, like, take a picture of her like she's surprised, like she's seeing something like, wow!  Yeah, her mouth is like, oh, wow, cookies!  And her eyes are all agape.  Every single picture.  Every picture.  They're trying to, like, undermine her that way.  Play the game with your local paper.  But Christina Aguilera is just, they put pictures of her in that are so hot, not a bad one. 
[01:15:00]  She got rid of the skank, too.  Daily News is different, yeah, the Hillary picture there.  She looks, on the cover of the Daily News, Hillary looks like, uh, uh, from magic.  She looks like fat.  She looks like Hopkins Puppet from magic.  Wow.  That's very accurate.  Because she has big fat cheeks and that, like, little thin area around them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Looks like, uh, yeah, her, her, the lower jaw is a different part.  Yeah, she should sit in a suitcase and just talk in a hotel room. 
[01:15:30]  I'm gonna run for president.  Well, here's the political cartoon for today.  It's, uh, President Bush in the Oval Office, you know, he's got, he's at his desk, behind  his desk, there's a, there's a globe in the background, map of the world there.  And then he's got, like, documents that say, uh, North Korea on the top of them.  Then he's got a document over here that says Iran.  Then he has another document that says Iraq.  All the problems he's having, feeling the pressure.  His, his ties askew in this cartoon.  He's got his big ears.  He looks, he looks very bothered, very nervous, very just, uh, just, just, just, uh, needs 
[01:16:00]  some help here.  Of course.  He's got the phone in his hand.  And, uh, the caption reads, quick, get me Jack Bauer.  I see the awful, terrible things in my life and turn it into something funny. 
[01:16:30]  Quick, swing and a miss.  Quick, get me Jack Bauer.  I get it.  It's a TV show.  See, cause he could take care of all these problems in 24 hours.  So, uh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Good luck.  Good luck to you.  Stop with the comedy in the newspapers. 
[01:17:00]  It's just not working.  Oh, uh, so the backpack, going to bed last night.  Yes.  Going to bed last night.  And, uh, and all of a sudden I hear, uh, uh, you better come quick and see this.  Oh.  And it's, uh, my lovely girlfriend.  And, uh, on the couch is my backpack that I bring, uh, to and fro this fine radio show  of ours every day.  And right next to it is a, uh, uh, a magazine. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, you wanted to guess.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  I blew up your whole bit.  What'd you do?  I didn't.  The backpack.  I just blew it.  What fell out of it?  A magazine.  Oh.  Cause you made some guesses.  I, I, no, I was wrong.  I had, um, I had bowling ball.  Pot of coffee.  I might have noticed that.  A pot of coffee.  Human leg.  No.  Cancer wig.  A salt lick.  Lemon meringue pie.  An oingo boingo CD. 
[01:18:00]  Those were my guesses.  All wrong.  Completely incorrect.  Wow.  So.  A salt lick.  Backpack that I, I, I, you know, bring to and fro.  Yep.  Next to the backpack, a lovely magazine with calendar.  Oh.  Okay.  With calendar.  That was a nice treat.  Uh, it was black inches on my couch with a, with a calendar.  The magazine was titled black inches.  It's the magazines that we buy from time to time at the newsstand.  Oh, right.  To, to horrify everybody around us. 
[01:18:30]  And, uh, obviously I did not bring a black inches magazine at home.  I wasn't smuggling.  And there are reasons to go to Thailand.  Yeah.  You know, hey, who are we to judge?  I wasn't smuggling gay porno into my house to maybe take a peek at, uh, at a later date.  Complete with calendar.  All 12 months, uh, represented very nicely, by the way.  Does your girlfriend usually dump out your backpack?  No, it was, uh, what was, uh, she was looking for someone like, ah, check my backpack, that 
[01:19:00]  type of thing.  No deal.  And, uh, and, uh, you know, that was the throw off.  Like, Hey, that was to throw her off the scent.  And as like, we're laughing about, I'm like, you know, there's a guilt that is associated  with you as a human being.  And I'm like, I'm looking at her, like staring at her, at her face.  Like she believes me.  Right.  That I did not try to smuggle this home to our, to our lovely house here.  Oh, like you were going to hide it somewhere.  Like from the back.  Okay.  I'll, I'm going into the bedroom.  I'll, I'll be right out. 
[01:19:30]  And then you take your backpack in with you and slide it under the mattress or something.  Oh, you get a quick look.  Oh, it's like when you go through the airport, you're going through security and stuff.  I get the same feeling.  I know I have nothing on me.  And I'm like, why are they looking at me?  They're going to stop me.  They're going to search me.  What, you know, I get all freaked out.  Even if I don't, what is wrong with you?  You're there's nothing going on here.  Even if the machine doesn't beep, I kind of stop and look at the guy like, eh, am I good?  Am I good?  You give that look a surprise, like you're going to let me go. 
[01:20:00]  I could just walk.  I'm free to go.  I'm free to go.  Okay.  So there's been something going on behind the scenes and it was finally my turn, I guess.  And there's been times that I have picked up because we all have XM backpacks.  There was one day I picked up what I thought was my XM satellite radio backpack to go home.  That's what I carry my stuff in.  Right.  And as I'm walking out of XM, I'm like, this bag is a lot heavier than I remember it being this morning.  And I open it up and it's just filled with sex toys.  Filled. 
[01:20:30]  Or marital aids.  Marital aids.  Marital aids.  I know.  Marital aids, a rowboat, a cinder block, and some rope.  So it's heavy and it was filled with marital aids.  Yee.  Steve's?  I have no idea.  That would be my backpack.  Who was it that day?  Well, our engineer over at XM, Marcelino.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who's hilarious, has this bit where he likes to put marital aids and magazines such as Black Inches into my book bag. 
[01:21:00]  Magazines in my book bag.  So he thought.  Magazines.  Obviously thought that that was my book bag.  Right.  And instead it put them in the boss's book bag.  Well, great.  And I was doing the whole Greg Brady thing, remember?  Oh, when the cigarettes fell out?  Yes.  They're not mine.  I'm telling you.  They're not my cigarettes.  We believe you, Greg.  They believed him because he doesn't lie.  And then he goes, you know, my parents believe me and I really respect that.  So I am going to find out whose cigarettes those are. 
[01:21:30]  And that's what he did.  And Alice realized that, hey, Greg, there's a rip here in the jacket, on your jacket.  And I remember stitching it up and there's no rip on this.  Hey, that's not my jacket.  That's what now I got to find out who the jacket belongs to.  That's who the cigarettes belong to.  That's right.  Mars.  Right.  Sir?  Did you put black inches in a book bag last week?  No, no, sir.  No, no, black inches.  The other marital aides was me. 
[01:22:00]  So someone else.  Who else is going to do that?  I have no idea.  He's lying.  Maybe somebody thinking that was yours, trying to get retribution.  This is true.  And that would be the black albino we have.  No, you don't keep your book bag where we keep our book bag.  What is black albino?  No, the black albino is Sam.  He's black but white.  Oh, wow, that was really funny.  See, he's hilarious.  Oh, wow.  You belt him.  I just want to hear Sam say book bag over and over. 
[01:22:30]  Book bag.  Book bag.  Book bag.  I don't know what the hell accent.  Yeah, I can't get a point across.  He says he's from New York.  Well, Mars puts you in a book bag.  Book bag.  He sounds like a black Scandinavian from Chicago.  All right, thanks, Mark.  All right, buddy.  Bye.  I'll get to the bottom of the book.  He put the magazine in a book bag.  Cindy, relax.  I'm going to put this black inches into your eye.  Have a cream soda, Cindy. 
[01:23:00]  All right.  We should.  Oh, speaking of 24, because this is really, really quick.  Muslim groups are concerned the fictional dark hero of Fox Television's 24 will jeopardize  their civil liberties by branding them as sleeper cell agents waiting for orders to strike.  Yeah.  The Muslims are pissed off that they're being portrayed as the terrorists.  That they're the terrorist bad guys on 24.  Right.  That upsets them because it gives the Muslims a bad name. 
[01:23:30]  They look bad.  And watch Hollywood fold eventually.  When people don't have access at work or have neighbors who are Muslim, they rely on the  images they see on television to shape their perceptions.  Yeah.  Ha ha ha.  A spokeswoman for the Council on American Islamic Relations.  The worst outcome would be that they would act on their fears.  They won't be able to distinguish peaceful, law-abiding American Muslims and the minority who act  against our faith and commit acts of terror. 
[01:24:00]  Against our faith.  Sure.  I like this.  This is my favorite part.  Muslims fear the show will foster hate against them and foster a climate of Islamophobia in  the country.  No, it's not the show that does that.  No.  Believe me.  It's not 24 that is doing that.  It's called the news and it's called American history from a few years back.  Don't worry.  We were hating you long before 24 became popular. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  Don't forget the 93 Trade Center bombing.  I mean, we wouldn't want to take credit for that.  Who did that?  Yeah.  Because remember when that show was out and the people that pulled that, those Canadians?  Yeah.  And we had portrayed Canadian terrorists.  I believe they were Muslims too.  Were the Irish people that attacked the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania?  Right.  And then a show was on that had Irish terrorists and they were very upset about that.  The Polish people that took the American hostages in 1979.  There you go. 
[01:25:00]  Can you just accept the fact that you're going to be typecast as terrorists?  It's your turn.  Because you're terrorists?  It's just your turn.  Yeah.  It's your turn in the barrel.  Stop behaving so naughtily.  A few years ago, I remember watching, well, Cowboys and Indians on TV.  The good old days.  It was the Indians were the bad guys.  It was just Cowboys and Indians.  Yeah.  And then for the next hundred years, it was blacks.  And now finally, finally we gave the blacks a break.  And now it's all about the Muslims being the bad guys.  There you go. 
[01:25:30]  God, we wore out the blacks like an old pair of shoes.  It was time for a brand new pair of Nikes.  And it says Muslim on the side.  Right.  You needed a criminal.  It's the Muslim brand.  A bad guy.  You got a black guy.  Wait.  It was American Indians?  Yeah.  It was the Germans?  Well, yeah.  Well, during war, you got to get against the guys you're fighting.  The little Japs in there.  Of course.  And that's what I was getting at.  But the 80s, you know, late 70s to 90s, about 90s, it was all about any, any, well, it was 
[01:26:00]  any like Soviet bloc Eastern kind of thing because who could forget Die Hard with the best  villain ever, Hans Gruber, East German.  Yep.  You know.  And in there, it was blacks for a long, long time.  Yeah.  And now it's the Muslims' turn.  It's just your turn.  It's just your turn.  Who will be next?  The Chinese.  Could be.  They are coming.  North Koreans, but we've already had them. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  It's just your time.  Deal with it.  Yeah.  Floridians are next.  All right.  Anthony's trying to wreck the show.  Yeah.  What did I do that I have no idea what I did?  We're going to get into that next.  I'd love to.  It's a tease for me.  And I don't even know what this is.  Do we have Hillary in studio today?  Hillary?  Hillary?  Now that you've announced your candidacy, what do you think about health care?  This country for many years has needed health care.  There are families that cannot afford the simplest of health care. 
[01:27:00]  And if I'm elected president, you will see every family in the United States will have  health care.  Like a freaking engine.  Engine's starting up.  Starts off normal every time, too.  And then.  Hey, there's your president. 
[01:27:30]  And speaking like this shows the sincerity I have in every word I am saying.  Like a robot.  I'd rather have Osimo as president than her.  Hey, Hillary.  My awful Osimo.  What do you want in the Super Bowl?  It's very easy.  Just pick a team.  I am rooting for the Bear Colts.  I love the Bear Colts.  Come on. 
[01:28:00]  Just pick one.  I love the Bears.  Yeah?  And the Colts.  So you want who in the Super Bowl?  It's really easy.  Okay.  I will pick the Colts with the Bears.  Let's go, teams.  I hope that's not too inside.  But here in New York.  Oh, she just asked her.  Mets or Yankees?  Pick one.  She couldn't pick a team.  Love them or hate them.  Rudy Giuliani.  Oh, it's Yankees.  I hate the Mets. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  Basically, that's what he said.  Always been.  But with Hillary, I don't want to piss off any group.  Got to keep it kind of keep it in the middle all the time.  Yeah.  Perish the thought.  She can't even take a stand on a goddamn sports team.  And she's going to run the country.  No.  Yes.  No.  Yes.  You're saying that she won't be able to make an accurate, like, an honest Super Bowl prediction?  I don't know.  Maybe she will pick a team.  I will pick the team with the t*** as a coach. 
[01:29:00]  Hillary, they both have one.  Then God bless those two t***.  That's not accurate.  Your impression's not accurate.  She's picking the one with...  She's a friend of the colored.  Jesus, 1950.  I'm not a friend of the one that's running against me. 
[01:29:30]  All right.  And I'm not afraid to call him a t***.  Be funny to watch, like, all her fans, like, kind of, like, wanting to clap.  What did she just say?  Yeah.  What?  Oh, Jesus.  Did she...  What?  Did I hear that right?  So, once again, Bears or Colts?  Very easy decision.  The Chicago Colts!  Someone better ask her that. 
[01:30:00]  It'll be...  Oh, ask her.  Watch her.  I guarantee she's not going to pick a team.  Melt.  Although, I think she spent some time in Chicago, right?  So, the smart choice for her would be the Bears, but I don't think she's brave enough to just say it.  She may pick Bears, A, because there's more voters in Chicago, and she's been there, or she may pick Colts because she loves horse gag.  Great video.  All right.  Well, uh...  What did I do?  Yeah, we'll do it next.  I got some audio of Anthony, and I've been blaming Jay Moore, but I think you're to blame. 
[01:30:30]  I really do.  Oh, no.  I think you're to blame.  I can get out of this.  Really?  Yeah, it was all...  We'll listen to the audio on the side.  But it's got us in quite a situation.  Quite a little stew.  A pickle?  Yes.  We're in a pickle.  Well, Anthony may have called someone the C word.  Oh.  That is very powerful.  I want to hear this, because I don't believe the context... 
[01:31:00]  A very powerful woman.  I don't believe the context I used it in.  And it's hurting us to this day.  Should be bad.  You just made me nervous.  I thought his ex-wife took over CBS radio.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and Live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.

[01:31:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony virus.  Are you ready?  Is this thing on?  Oh, Jesus.  I'm so burnt out.  I haven't done these in a while.  All right.  Here's the deal.  January 27th.  It's a Saturday.  I don't even have to say that.  Take a look at the calendar.  January 27th.  Quakertown Firehouse.  Now, I know you're saying, hey, a guy with a big career like that, why is he doing the  Firehouse? 
[01:32:00]  And I would love to say it's a fundraiser, but it's not.  It's just good money.  Listen to me.  I got until January 28th to get into the top five on this Comedy Central countdown.  Go to ComedyCentral.com and just click it on the countdown to see my face and vote.  This is important.  I don't know why it's important because you don't win anything.  It's all ego.  So, that's it.  Fuck.  I'm done. 
[01:32:30]  Good morning.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  So, we're big fans of American Idol, especially like the early rounds where it's kind of just  goofing on the idiots. 
[01:33:00]  The freak show.  The freak show for TV.  They're taking all kinds of heat though now.  Taking all kinds of heat because it's so mean this year.  They're abusing the retarded people that come into it.  It's fair game.  Anybody comes into audition, I think you should be able to just give them a little verbal lashing.  37 million people watching.  What's the problem?  They're enjoying it.  They're enjoying the hell out of it.  Well, that seems to be the problem is when a lot of people enjoy something, it doesn't 
[01:33:30]  matter.  If a couple of people don't like it, they could have it taken away or stopped.  That's kind of scary, but true.  And then Simon called one of the contestants a bush baby.  Said he looked like a bush baby.  So then when you all went home or, well, you're watching it already at home and you're googling  bush baby to see what a bush baby looks like.  What the hell does a bush baby look like?  And then you're laughing even harder, realizing it's quite accurate.  Yeah, he did.  His observation.  There was something wrong with that kid.  Well, now Simon is apologizing. 
[01:34:00]  Ew, for what?  He's basically saying he shouldn't have called the kid a bush baby.  Why would he apologize?  Kind of surprised by the apology from Simon Cowell.  You know why?  He must have gotten a lot of pressure.  The producers, all these people jump on you because they get this knee-jerk reaction all  the time.  They got a bunch of letters or something that said, it's so mean.  And Simon seemed to me.  You know, I liked when he was a critical, but too mean now.  So, they probably pulled him into a meeting and said, could you tame it down?  And you need to apologize to the bush baby. 
[01:34:30]  I don't see the producers making him do anything, though, because he's like the most powerful  guy in television right now.  I can't see anybody telling him you have to do it.  What are they going to do, fire him?  Just the whole show.  Yeah.  They would.  Simon?  You know something?  No way.  Because they're stupid.  Producers are stupid.  Hi.  I'm just a little fan.  They're just, they don't realize things like that.  They don't see things like an artist can see it.  Like, wow, that guy's talented. 
[01:35:00]  He's the guy that gets it.  If he went up against them too much, they'd throw him out.  Isn't it his show?  No.  I think it was his idea.  I'm sure he sold it and just makes a bloody fortune.  Simon, somebody else.  It's his idea.  Some other Simon.  Oh, it's Simon Cowell came up with the concept.  Simon Cowell came up with the idea of American Idol.  Yeah.  No.  I'm saying no.  This is created by Simon something.  Fuller.  Right.  It's a different Simon.  Simon's been in trouble.  He's been sued by Simon Fuller for ripping off the idea. 
[01:35:30]  But Simon Cowell brought it to America and it's his American Idol.  I don't think so.  Get some info.  I don't think so.  Get some info.  Oh, boy.  We should have checked on this one first.  No kidding.  Anyway, well, the point I'm getting at here, it would be nice if we could get some of these  American Idol rejects on our show.  Sure.  You know, maybe some of the ones they goofed on.  It would be fun.  Yeah.  And then as the show goes on, you know, we get the ones that get voted off. 
[01:36:00]  So we set up with Roland's like, hey, Roland, American Idol's back.  37 million viewers first week.  Want to get some people from American Idol on the show.  How hard could it be?  And then that's when Roland said, yeah, do you remember the Taylor Hicks interview?  And I remember it.  It went well.  I thought it went well.  It totally went well.  I thought it went well.  And then there were allegations of the C word being thrown around.  Yeah.  And then we all point our finger like, oh, well, it was Jay Moore. 
[01:36:30]  He was in the studio.  Jay Moore.  It was Jay Moore that called her the C word because I guess we were getting a little saucy  with our interview.  Yeah, it was getting saucy and it wasn't adhering to that American Idol image.  And we had heard that the publicist wasn't happy with the way the interview was going  and wanted to stop the interview.  So we wanted to continue talking to Taylor and somehow it got back to the woman. 
[01:37:00]  Well, she was listening on the line.  And I think she might have piped in like, ah.  Yeah, it's time to go or we got to cut this off.  Because it was going to an area she wasn't comfortable with.  And that's when we thought Jay Moore called her the C word.  He did.  Getting us in a lot of trouble with the publicist for the American Idol contestant.  He did.  Well, now I'm hearing things.  I'm hearing things about you.  Listen to my quote. 
[01:37:30]  I haven't heard this, but I know.  I think, or at least I think, I make a sweeping generalization.  About women?  Yeah.  About women overall.  No, about publicists.  Yeah.  I wasn't being specific as to this woman publicist.  I was making a generalization over the course of my history in radio dealing with publicists  that most women publicists are this word.  Didn't mean all of them was. 
[01:38:00]  And I surely wasn't saying this one was.  Jay Moore then specifically called her out as being one of those.  And where are we at now because of that, Roland?  That's my story and I'm sticking to it.  And she's re-evaluating it right now.  Re-evaluating.  Yeah, because I...  That sounds like there'll be an internal investigation and we'll get you right back on the air.  What I call, I go, Happy New Year.  She goes, yeah.  Yeah.  So what are you hearing, though, before that?  What's the word on the street?  She's still very upset with it for some reason. 
[01:38:30]  You know what?  She's not going to forgive it.  It's like, come on.  What are you going to do?  Yeah, well, she is sort of...  Well, because then you call up and go, well, the guys want some American Idol contestants on.  Yeah.  And that's when she reminded you?  Yeah, it reminded me of...  Then I said, it wasn't them.  It was Jay Moore.  I said, Jay Moore.  Jay Moore.  Jay Moore.  Just keep blaming Jay Moore.  And Kevin Smith because he was in studio that day, too.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  I said, like, Jay Moore popped in unexpectedly.  I was shocked he was here and he said that word to you and I'm shocked.  So...  So she's re-evaluating. 
[01:39:00]  Re-evaluating.  Her decision not to ever have any American Idols ever on our show again.  Okay.  All right.  Well, here's the audio from that famous interview with Taylor Hick.  You be the judge.  Are you guys doing any New York or New Jersey venues?  Yeah, of course.  You go to AmericanIdol.com and they'll find all the tour dates and...  Yeah.  Can I come to the show?  All good.  Everything's going to be great, man.  Girl.  You know, like I said, I went from performing in bars and little places to being on a stage 
[01:39:30]  like this and it's a dream come true for me.  So far, so good.  Yeah.  Sounds like a fine interview with Taylor Hick.  Look, not a problem.  The winner of American Idol.  Not even a problem.  All right.  We're talking...  Jimmy wants to go to the show.  He's talking about how he went from little bands up until big arenas.  Where's the problem?  And that was the end of the interview.  So we should get the American Idol contestant.  Yeah.  Right?  That proves right there everything went fine.  All right.  Send her that tape.  All right.  There might be a little more.  Let's just hear the goodbye.  We had a nice goodbye with tonight. 
[01:40:00]  All right.  Yeah.  This should be just a goodbye at this point.  A lot like Jimmy.  Yeah.  What kind of album are you going to do?  Like a soul album, obviously?  Yeah, soul, man.  Soul album.  My own album.  My stamp of approval, you know?  It's me that's gotten me here and I'm not changing.  Hey, I got a note.  I'll read it word for word.  Publicist called.  He has to move on now.  Damn it.  Oh, boy.  All right.  All right.  So...  Opie's delivery of that note message started the ball rolling. 
[01:40:30]  Perhaps it was a small snowball, but you pushed it down the hill with your, has to go now.  Well, there's nothing that annoys us more on this show than a stupid publicist getting  in the way of an interview.  You're right.  Than a wonderful publicist.  I mean, a wonderful publicist.  Doing their job.  Doing their job.  Because I'm sure they're very busy with other interviews.  Of course.  They're much more important than the Opie and Anthony show.  All right.  So you give the word.  Now, I can't imagine just based on that, that I just start throwing the C word around. 
[01:41:00]  Are you trying to call me an instigator?  You are an instigator.  Yeah?  But I can't, like I said, I can't just see you reading that and then me just blurting out  that word.  All right.  Let's see how it developed from there.  So we were having a good interview.  It was his time to go.  Somebody probably, Roland or Than, handed me that note and I read it.  Now.  Damn it.  I guess they're not happy with how we're interviewing her.  It's satellite radio though, so that's why.  She sounds like a real c***.  Publicist.  All right.  That was Jay Moore. 
[01:41:30]  I'm vindicated.  Yeah.  There's a minute left in this.  Oh.  Damn it.  I heard myself just say publicist too and I doubt it's going to be are doing the best  they can.  Oh no.  Yeah.  Let's share the guilt.  So Jay chimed in.  So far.  And directly used the word on her.  So far I instigated and Jay went right for the jump.  And I'm completely innocent so far. 
[01:42:00]  Jay didn't even like give it, give it a chance to maybe defuse itself.  No.  He jumped right in.  Oh my god.  It wasn't even on pause.  He targeted her and fired.  Read it word for word.  Publicist called.  He has to move on now.  Damn it.  I guess they're not happy with how we're interviewing her.  It's satellite radio though.  She sounds like a real ****.  Publicists always do that.  Publicists are usually ****.  Don't you agree?  All right.  Look.  Hey.  That is not anything. 
[01:42:30]  It is not an implication of her as being whatever.  I said publicists are usually, which in my experiences this is what I found.  I didn't call her it.  I am not taking blame.  I think this little bit of tape vindicates me.  I've been exonerated.  Roland?  You love them all.  I love them all.  Sure.  Whatever.  They're all, here's the bottom line.  She's being, she just wants to have a hard on for something because Jay said that even,  not even directly to her. 
[01:43:00]  It's not like she was on the phone or in the room and then Jay's blasted her with that.  He was saying that as a report of what Oprah just said.  That's a completely detached thing.  She's just, she's throwing power around.  That's all she's doing.  I'm a powerful woman and I don't need to be, that's all she's doing.  There's still like a minute left in this though.  Shouldn't there also be, shouldn't there also be like a law where they have to say,  and by the way, a publicist will be listening in on this call?  Like, you never know.  Most of the time they do.  Most of the time they do.  How about, hey, a publicist, do you mind if a publicist listens? 
[01:43:30]  And we go, yeah, we do mind.  Can you just have her not listen?  Why not?  Why not?  But you jumped right on.  Had your chances at getting American Idol guests die.  You jumped right in.  Yeah.  I piled on.  Absolutely.  Is that what happened?  I'm on radio though, so that's why.  She sounds like a real p***.  Publicists always do that.  Publicists are usually p***.  Don't you agree with that, Taylor?  This is, they're worried about your image, I'm sure.  Well, no, I don't, I don't think it's, I, like I said, I've got about 15 more interviews 
[01:44:00]  to do, so I think they're kind of just p*** them.  What interview s*** them in their f***ing s***es, they are nothing wrong.  All right, Ed.  You know what, Ed?  You are so done.  Are you kidding me?  Explain that one.  Now, I was talking about the other shows.  Oh my God.  Now, now still, I'm safe.  I did go off with a tirade.  That was a multi-curse tirade.  I read a lousy note. 
[01:44:30]  J calls are the C word.  You say all publicists are Cs.  No, I said usually.  And then we're trying to get the interview back on track, and then you went on some diatribe.  You know you're guilty when the C bomb has been dropped, and Ope said, you said that they're  always, no, no, no, I said they're usually.  Usually.  The semantics of always and usually.  It is.  Work for Clinton.  He's just trying not to get life.  Yeah, I am pleading.  Usually c***.  Don't you agree with that, Taylor? 
[01:45:00]  Taylor, this is, they're worried about your image, I'm sure.  Well, no, I don't think it's, like I said, I've got about 15 more interviews to do, so  I think they're kind of just c*** them.  What interview c*** them in their c***s is they are nothing but c*** clown shoes.  Well, you're a c*** lady, you c***.  Okay.  That was Jay.  Oh boy.  Yeah, Jay went off.  Here's what happened.  You mentioned that Kevin Smith was in studio.  Yeah.  What I was doing was a line from one of his movies.  That is an actual line from one of his movies. 
[01:45:30]  Okay.  It's an email.  They're in character reading emails and that's one of the emails that he got.  So I was doing a line.  It was in character.  Oh, okay.  See, it wasn't May.  She misunderstood.  And then the interview got completely out of control with you saying F-M blah, blah, blah.  And then that's when the publicist is now heard.  And she like pops on the interview.  Yeah.  To say, all right, enough, done.  And that's when Jay really hit her once again with the C-bomb.  Did he? 
[01:46:00]  I'm in there.  They are nothing but c*** clown shoes.  Well, you're a c*** lady, you c*** bitch.  C*** you.  Jimmy.  So.  Okay.  See, Jay is completely responsible for our inability now to get guests from American Idol.  I don't know who would blame it.  No, it is all Jay Moore's fault.  He was drinking a NyQuil smoothie.  What are you going to say?  That is total Jay Moore.  That put her over the edge. 
[01:46:30]  She's a publicist, first of all.  She's heard the language I was using.  And none of it was directed directly at her.  Even the other thing.  I said, for the most part, publicists are blind.  I didn't say her.  What about the whole thing?  Jay, the diatribe?  Yeah.  That was based on other shows.  I said, not to her.  I said, the other shows can do that.  And it was a line from what in Kevin Smith's movies?  What movie?  It was from Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. 
[01:47:00]  And Jay then chimes in and completely wrecks it by just directing it right at her over the phone.  Personal phone call.  Yeah, let's blame Jay.  Jay Moore is still to blame.  I like it.  Let's blame Jay.  Four interviews to do.  So I think they're kind of just **** them.  What interview **** them in their ****es?  They are nothing but **** clown shoes.  You have to go.  Well, you're a **** lady.  You **** ****.  **** you.  Jimmy.  So we... 
[01:47:30]  That was Jay Moore.  Hello?  We're never getting another guest again.  Forever.  Forever.  Forever.  Do you hear Jay trying to blame me?  Yeah.  Call the publicist for her.  Yeah, but she's a publicist.  How big could she be?  Call the publicist.  Yeah, he goes, how big could she be?  American Idol.  He's only represented an American Idol.  Oh my God.  That's great.  Yeah, he calls her all that and then he goes, Jim.  Jimmy.  Like Jimmy said it.  He goes, how big could she possibly be? 
[01:48:00]  Oh, I don't know.  American Idol, house 24.  Oh, that's it?  All right.  The publicist.  Stop.  My God.  You called the publicist for her.  Yeah, but she did.  It's a publicist.  How big could she be?  You called the publicist for **** for her.  What other kind of...  And we were just starting to get real guests.  Oh, wow.  You've had great guests lately.  Wow, are we never ever getting another guest?  You watch how the guests drastically drop after today.  Kevin's not coming back.  He's doing scratch-off tickets. 
[01:48:30]  He's bored with the show already.  He's done three Sudokus.  I will always come back.  Wow, well, there you go.  See?  That's it.  Now that I've heard the audio, I blame Jay Moore.  I blame Jay Moore.  So where are we at with this?  You're trying to smooth things over, Rose?  Smooth things over.  She's reconsidering because I told her, explained to her, all the voices you heard that were  directed towards her was Jay Moore.  Yeah, blame Jay.  He'll take the bullet for us, too.  That's right.  There's your audio.  He's still friendly.  Yeah, it was audio.  It's just Jay Moore.  With Kevin Smith in there, I forgot to bring up the fact that I play 
[01:49:00]  poker with him and got raped.  What are you talking about?  I got raped Friday.  Yeah.  I went to Jersey, to his comic book store, and played poker with him and other people  that were there.  Anybody famous?  No, like message board people and stuff.  He's a cool guy.  He has like little contests and their message board people get to hang out at his comic  book store and play some poker here and in L.A. where he lives. 
[01:49:30]  So I was just the fish.  I was the catch and release fish.  Just don't kill him.  Don't kill him.  Let's let him out because then you'll get some and you'll get to share.  I was digging the pocket guy because you were able to buy back in.  It was a cash game.  $100 buy-in.  And just I could not get cards.  Could not get cards.  And everyone else is getting a pretty good hand.  I try to push him out.  And you get like kind of crappy cards.  I bet big trying to push someone out. 
[01:50:00]  But they'd always have hands.  I'm losing with like – and I finally get like pocket queens.  I'm like, okay, now I'm playing them.  I got queens.  And the board is showing nothing.  It's showing a four, a seven, and an eight, something like that.  Just garbage.  And I push all in because I got to make some money back.  And Kevin's got pocket fours.  And there's a four on the board.  So he's got his tripped fours against my pocket queens.  And that was how it went all night long.  I dropped $500. 
[01:50:30]  I asked Kevin.  I demanded a production credit on his next movie.  I've dropped so much money in that stupid store.  Yeah, but you had tripped fours.  He had tripped fours.  What about the river card?  See, here goes Jimmy now, who knows nothing about Texas Hold'em.  And the river card didn't help me.  Exactly.  If it was a queen, I would have won.  Yeah.  Hold'em.  Hold'em.  He just knows.  Big Kev was at the game. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  Big Kev was at the game.  He also didn't do very well.  And that's why he's calling, just to tell us he didn't do well either.  I gather.  That's something that listeners are going to care about.  Maybe he has more information.  Maybe he has more info.  The next day, he did go to one of these conventions.  So there were some big celebrities there.  Kev?  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  How you doing?  How are you?  Good.  You lost some money, too?  I did.  Not nearly as much as you, though.  Yeah, I was digging the pocket guy, and they were all laughing at me.  So what can you add to this conversation besides the fact that you are also in the same building as Anthony? 
[01:51:30]  I've never seen Anthony lose so much on such skinny, skinny misses.  Yep.  It was the worst poker I've ever played in my life.  Were you cocky going in, Ant?  Let me ask you this.  Were you cocky?  I'm a good poker player.  I'm a good poker player.  And I really thought I was going to do well, or at least in the middle of the pack.  I sucked because I got crap cards and no one backed down. 
[01:52:00]  There was no betting anybody out.  Is that true, Big Kev?  Absolutely true.  And it wasn't even so much as that, but once Smith got money in his hand, he just bullied the table.  Oh, he's a bully.  Kevin Smith's a bully.  That's all he did.  He had a huge stack, and he's just bullying everybody around.  Like, I got this little stack of chips.  So, of course, if I bet half of him, he's just going to put me all in.  And then I'm either winning the hand, and I get to play, or I'm gone, and I'm out of the game, or digging back into my pocket. 
[01:52:30]  Did you have a character?  Because they're like the Unabomber and all these guys.  Like, were you a radio guy?  Like, you just had on two, like, golden headphones?  That's exactly what it is.  I talked everything into a microphone.  Yet, I'll check.  Check.  Check.  Check one or two.  Radio station jacket with the call letters on it?  No, I was sap guy.  I was fish.  I was the sucker at the table.  I was the one that everybody could just feed off of.  It was horrible.  It was the worst poker I've ever played in my life. 
[01:53:00]  I wasn't playing bad.  Anyone that knew Anthony at the table there, like, from the radio show, knows how much he talked about playing poker,  or was just looking at him during the game going, I really thought you'd played this game before.  Yeah.  Just getting horrible hands.  And then after a while, a folder, you fold everything.  Fold, fold, fold.  And then you start going, screw it.  Let me play this, you know, Queen 5.  It looks great.  Every day.  Anything starts looking good.  But he cleaned up.  But it was fun.  And I'm sure I'll be welcomed back with open arms. 
[01:53:30]  As long as I have money with me.  I think, yeah.  Already been established.  How is Soupy Sales, by the way?  He ran into Soupy Sales at the...  Oh, my.  Hey, is the butcher Ed Brock there today?  Because he showed up at the convention on Saturday, and I wanted him to take a look at Soupy Sales.  So when I talked about it, that there would be someone there who understood.  Soupy Sales couldn't speak, and he barely moved, and he had, like, this one sort of expression on his face.  Ant, I sent you that picture.  Yeah, he's in a wheelchair now.  Remember when we saw him walking down the street when we first got to New York? 
[01:54:00]  The vibrant Soupy Sales.  He was like, he'd walk to work, and we waved to him, hey, Soupy.  And he kind of went, like, hey.  And now, you know, a dozen years later or so, not even, like nine years later, whatever, he's in a wheelchair with the head tilted to the side.  Yeah, and his mouth kind of open, and I could not believe that they wheeled him in there for that.  Do people put a pen in his hand and just kind of work his hand to do an autograph?  Yeah, yeah, it was something like that.  Oh, just love the guy. 
[01:54:30]  Rest in peace.  Poor bastard.  Great to see him, but just sad.  Soupy, we hardly knew ye.  And then that time wins every time.  And then also I heard he told me that the girl that was John Travolta's dancing partner in Saturday Night Fever is there.  What was her name?  Karen Lynn Borney.  Yeah, she was the one that he was in the dance contest with, and it's all she's done.  She's there all the time, man.  She's very popular.  She was old in the movie. 
[01:55:00]  Like, how old is she now?  She's older, much older.  And she prints out the cover.  Remember how the Saturday Night Fever thing looked with the dance floor and John Travolta in his white suit?  She prints a bunch of those out and sells them for how much?  Yeah, the poster reproductions that she has there, 11 by 17.  She sells those.  It's quite a bargain at $60 with her signature on it.  $60.  For a poster?  For a poster.  Not even the real poster?  No, no, no.  It's like a printout. 
[01:55:30]  A printout of the real poster.  She prints them out at home.  11 by 17.  Hey, you know, but if you like that thing, you're into that sort of thing, you might pay $50, $60.  I'd rather throw myself off the Verrazano Bridge because Tony didn't call me.  Get her crappy autograph.  We got a break.  All right, Kev.  I'll talk to you.  Take care.  All right, big Kev, everyone.  And then I get a text that he's got two flat tires as we're driving home.  We had just kind of pulled away, and I made like I didn't get the text because I was well  on my way. 
[01:56:00]  We got to talk about the Lamborghini.  Oh, I'm just an ass.  I'm like driving on the rims.  I'm busy.  It was like 5.30 in the morning.  I played for hours.  It was getting light out.  Can we talk about bumper cars and Lamborghinis next?  I ran the gamut of auto driving this weekend.  All right, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, we're running out of show here. 
[01:56:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm going to miss Anthony.  Getting ready to play What Did You Learn on the Opie and Anthony show today.  Love it.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  Before we get into that, though.  Yeah.  Anthony was tooling around in a Lamborghini this weekend.  Yup.  Absolutely.  Got a couple of guests.  Guys, step up to the mic, man.  Mike, Zach.  I had a great time over the weekend.  Thank you.  I got you to thank.  Give the plug, man. 
[01:57:00]  Classic Car Club?  Into the mic.  ClassicCarClub.com?  ClassicCarClub.com.  Aw, he's so shy in front of the microphone.  I don't know.  He's got all sorts of muscle cars, but when it comes to talking on the radio,  he's just shy.  He's a doll.  Here's the deal.  You get into this club, and you hired Mark David Chapman, I see.  That is exactly what we like.  Wow.  I never even realized that.  He's not living that down. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  What?  He's not living that down.  Taking a haircut, I guess.  Yeah, yeah.  You join the club, and you get to drive exotic vehicles that you don't get a chance to drive.  So you guys just picked this up.  This is a 2006 Lamborghini Gallardo.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  So you guys had it in the city, because they're set up here in Manhattan,  and this was the first time it was really taken out on the highway and opened up.  I've driven it up and down the driveway.  Yeah, on the driveway. 
[01:58:00]  Up and down the driveway.  You can take it 100 and quadrillion miles an hour down the highway.  It's a much better job.  So I get it for the test run.  I take it down, of course, Ocean Parkway down there on Long Island.  Sure.  Nice stretch of straight road level for the most part.  I've gotten my Grand Cherokee up to 85 miles an hour on that road.  85.  On that road.  Well, if you go to whackbag.com and look for the thread, I believe I called it,  come with me on another calm Sunday drive. 
[01:58:30]  It's me doing 135 miles an hour down Ocean Parkway, and it didn't even put a dent in it.  I mean, I could have gone a lot faster.  Why did you stop at 135, though?  Because there was a couple other cars on the road.  I passed them like they were parked.  You were being cautious.  And then, you know what got me?  It's Cement Slab Road.  And you know when you drive, you hear, for the most part?  As I accelerated, it was like, and then all I heard was like this light. 
[01:59:00]  And I looked down for a split second at the speedometer, and I was doing 135.  And there's something about that speed that makes me go, you know something?  Back off.  I couldn't bring it up.  Someone else I know brought it up to 150 on that road.  But I would love to try it again.  I think I could hit the 150 mark.  How about you don't?  How about you don't try it again?  It is so exciting.  Is it exhilarating? 
[01:59:30]  How about you drive golf carts on the weekend?  It is exciting.  Up and down your driveway.  When you're doing 135 in a Lamborghini, first of all, if someone hands you the keys to a Lamborghini,  and you don't do at least 135, 150 in it, give the keys back with your new testicle keychain,  because you have no balls.  You've got to.  You're obligated as a man to drive fast in that car.  How about this?  You don't.  How about you hop in your Escalade, and you do 65, and you drive 10 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 
[02:00:00]  and you buckle up selfish?  I have a mortgage to pay.  The Opie and Jimmy show after that.  Yeah.  Hey.  After the Lamborghini, yeah, the Escalade was like driving on the mast of a tall ship.  It was so high up.  This thing nice, low to the ground.  And you guys got like everything.  Name some of the cars you guys got down there.  We have everything from that.  We have a Ford GT, which, by the way, I've had up to 180 miles now.  Should pick it up a little bit.  We just bought a new Di Tommaso Pantera.  It's kind of cool.  Pantera.  We have 911 Turbos. 
[02:00:30]  We have Shelby Cobra.  Did he return the Lamborghini in good shape, by the way?  No, no, no.  He's a celebrity, so he sent his friend to drop it off.  Ew.  Yeah.  My friend dropped it off.  Remember the time we had Lex?  The Lexus people?  The Lexus.  But, I mean, they gave it to me in the middle of winter.  I couldn't even go up a little one degree incline.  My wheels were going.  They gave us each Lexus for a month.  Well, in Anthony's case.  I didn't give it back.  It was four or five months before they finally came in. 
[02:01:00]  They actually had to repo a car that they gave me to use for free.  I wouldn't give it back.  I kept going, yeah, tomorrow.  Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.  But this thing, I could definitely...  Lexus is sensible compared to...  We're going to have to work something out because I...  We just got a new Ferrari 430, so you've got to come do that one next.  You've got to break it in for us.  Please.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks so much.  Again, give the website.  ClassicCarClub.com.  ClassicCarClub.com.  I'm watching the video, man.  You're passing these...  Wow.  Dude, it's like they're standing completely still. 
[02:01:30]  You've got bigger balls than me.  It's ridiculous.  There's no way.  You know what it is?  It's a straight stretch of road.  There's no way.  A lot of sand, though, man.  You gotta watch out for that.  I'm not...  You know something, though?  There's a lot of sand.  It had been windy enough where it blew it.  The road was very clear.  And that road has...  Not traffic.  That road has deer that jump across every once in a while.  Weren't you thinking that maybe something would just pop out of the bushes that you're trying...  What gets into your head like this, you know, obviously something bad could happen.  But the excitement of driving a Lamborghini, a brand new Lamborghini, this is right out 
[02:02:00]  of the box, and then doing that on a straight stretch of road like that, it's fantastic.  I didn't smell it.  I had a new car smell.  New car.  Hand-stitched leather.  I mean, the car was immaculate.  This is a V10.  I couldn't even be a passenger in a car going fast.  No!  My passenger was videotaping it, and he's just laughing and, you know, trying to videotape  the...  I think it's funny that you and your passenger decided to go to the beach.  You know what?  It really is the only place... 
[02:02:30]  I was able to get it up to 110 on the Meadowbrook, but there were too many cars there.  Yeah, it's like...  I got behind a Crown Victoria that wasn't a cop in the left lane, and if anything, this  bright yellow Lamborghini behind you, please, could you just get out of the way?  I don't want to do 45.  Or else, in your drive-by, they all stare at you, and they drive into you.  Oh, everyone stares at you.  You know, they drive into you.  Like in your car.  They do that in your car.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They come into you and drive...  Or better, they look at you and drive into the car in front of them.  We've had that happen.  Yeah, that's another one.  That's all the time. 
[02:03:00]  We cause a lot of accidents.  People watch you, and then they hit the car in front of you.  Get out of the way.  Everyone looks, too.  Everybody looks at this car.  It's one of those cars that doesn't matter.  You're going to look at it.  Yeah, you picked the right road, too, as far as Long Island goes.  That's the only place to really...  There's not many roads where you could open it up like that.  Unless you go way out east, way out east.  But down there, down there's good.  You go westbound, or eastbound first, and then you scope it out.  You do, you know, pretty good speed.  You kind of hit it a couple of times.  But then when you turn around, you do the U-turn, and you pretty much know it's clear for the most part. 
[02:03:30]  And then you could just gas it.  Dude, you have no problem.  I see you passing these cars like they're standing still.  Aren't you worried that they might drift over into your lane out of nowhere?  No.  They're just driving.  The cops are actually like park police.  You know, they do nothing all the time.  Yeah, they can't do anything.  You go by, they must be like calling their friends.  Made it big time.  I passed one of those goddamn Z06 bastard vet jerk-offs.  I passed one of them, and he didn't even look. 
[02:04:00]  He kept his head straight.  I don't want to get any crap from any of those guys, because they don't even have a chance.  I heard you're doing some work to your car, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You going to get those Corvette guys back?  I'm getting the new Roush supercharger put on there.  You should have kept it.  I'm increasing it up to about 600 and change horsepower.  Why don't you go to a track and ride in a circle?  Because it's more fun this way.  Is it?  There's no cops to look out for on the track.  This is exciting.  You feel like you're alive when you're doing stuff like this. 
[02:04:30]  Do you understand, once the Opie and Anthony show has its run in entertainment and is done,  and you guys retire and say, we had a great time, I love you, but I'll drive you into a brick wall if you want.  You ought to come down, get a car, have a little fun.  All right.  I'm a coward.  You'd love it.  What kind of cars do you have?  They've got everything.  They've got, like, 35 cars.  And they've got, like, classic muscle cars, too, if you're into that, you know, if you're into the older cars. 
[02:05:00]  We have an old Chevelle we just put disc brakes into, so it's bad but sensible.  Yeah, a little sensible.  You could stop after you're doing 120.  You have to put your foot down at the door anymore.  It's nice.  And then Anthony ended his weekend by doing some bumper cars.  Well, not bumper cars.  It was, I went to a 12-year-old's birthday party.  Yeah.  But it was at Strike in Great Neck.  Yeah.  And they have go-carts.  And you've got to fill out these releases.  And these releases are like, you give up every right you've ever had as being an American.  And you're like, you can't take me to court ever.  I don't care where you are. 
[02:05:30]  No alcohol.  And meanwhile, you're at the bar at a 12-year-old birthday party.  What else are you going to do?  You're drinking.  So I'm drinking.  And then I hop on the go-carts.  And they go pretty fast for the size of the track and everything.  It's a lot of fun.  But I was being very competitive, maybe a little too much.  I was being yelled at by the attendants, break, break.  Because I'd see, like, guys that are 8, 9-year-old kids, and they'd be blocking me.  So I'd just wail right between them.  And then there's a hairpin turn.  And if the guy was on the inside, there's like an 8-year-old kid, and he was on the inside. 
[02:06:00]  So I was going around the hairpin turn.  And I cut him off, and he crashed right into the wall at the hairpin.  And I'm laughing.  And he's crying.  And the attendant has remote controls of your governor's.  And he shut my engine off.  Did he really?  I'm like, God damn you.  I'm driving a Lamborghini.  Help me, Tom Cruise.  That's very cool.  I went from that to go-carts.  All right.  Let's play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  All right. 
[02:06:30]  Sonny Pirelli from Boston.  What's up, Sonny?  Hey, guys.  I learned that Ant not only sucks at pest poker, he also sucks at kiddie poker with comic book geeks.  Pirelli, let me tell you something.  You're no friggin' Daniel Negreanu when it comes to pest poker.  The guy's usually out before I am.  That's online.  Ew.  What?  We play online, pest poker, every Sunday.  How to make a Daniel Negreanu reference.  Oh, he's a very good poker player.  We know.  We know.  And your guys are great friends with him.  I heard you had a great discussion. 
[02:07:00]  We beat him up.  He's a prick with an awful hairdo and a girlfriend that dumped him to sleep with a colored gentleman.  That's right.  That's what we know about him.  And he's a fantastic poker player.  He should be.  He's awful with the ladies.  Let's go to Skunk Boy from Pal Talk.  Skunk Boy, what did you learn today?  I learned that if you start your shift at 6 o'clock and you don't have your first break until 8.30, you learn nothing.  You lose.  Good day, sir.  So you didn't even hear the show today? 
[02:07:30]  I heard the opening music and then I came back during the Respect for MLK bit that was on XM.  All right.  I'm sorry about that.  All right.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Let's go to Taylor in Texas.  Taylor, what's up?  Hey, man.  Hey.  You know, the thing I learned is that, you know, you can have a nice car, but the thing is is that, and I don't know if you agree with this,  when you have a nice car, like a Lamborghini, most guys check you out. 
[02:08:00]  There are even more guys.  Yeah, it's all the guys looking.  Yep, you're right.  Yeah.  That's what you learned?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Wow.  Thanks, Taylor.  So you learned that Anthony's a homosexual magnet in that vehicle.  Hey, there you go.  With calls like that, we'll be number one in no time.  They love me.  Well, we've run out of time, unfortunately.  There's lots of other what have we learned, but we're not going to get to them.  All right.  The music started. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, that dumb music out of nowhere just starts up like that.  Don't you hit that button if that makes, no?  Hey, guys.  Thanks for checking us out.  We greatly appreciate it.  Oh, yeah.  We got a lot done today, huh?  Absolutely.  And join us over at XM.  And don't forget, go Bears.  Bet everything on the Colts.  Go Bears.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  See you tomorrow. 
[02:09:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.  XM 202.

[02:11:00]  Thank you. 
[02:11:30]  Thank you. 
[02:12:00]  Thank you.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country. 
[02:12:30]  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're rude. 
[02:13:00]  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We had the effect of town hall CM.  So important.  Then he grabbed the mic the second I gave everyone mic access for that three seconds.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Morton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver. 
[02:13:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  You know, I was just listening to the show opener.  I got a confession to make.  What, sweetie?  I never could have been a model.  I got to be honest with everybody today.  Aw, that's sad.  We are on the same page today about the bit you mentioned earlier, which I was thinking of.  And I was giggling yesterday.  About what?  That stupid line.  It's so obnoxious.  I know.  It was just, it was such an, you know, I could have been a model. 
[02:14:00]  Could have been a model.  It was just such defiance.  What the fuck does that mean?  Anyway, like a model's life is much better than this horse shit.  But just like, do you fuckers realize how lucky you got by getting me?  Oh my God, that's right.  Because Calvin Klein was calling.  Do you realize what I gave up for this?  God, that is funny.  A model.  Just screaming it at someone.  It's out of context or whatever.  Of course it is.  Yeah, you know.  How could that ever be good in context? 
[02:14:30]  In what context?  There's no context that works in.  I kept yelling, I could have been a model.  Unless you're playing the subconscious of a burn victim talking to God.  Right.  And I don't think that was the context at the time, no.  By the way, every day people are bitching because we're not doing the walkover.  Just deal with it.  But it's time to rest the walkover.  Relax with the walkover.  And with the weather being how it is, it's a good time of year to just rest it for a month, month and a half.  And then we bring it back and there'll be a new excitement. 
[02:15:00]  It's not exciting anymore.  For the listeners, for us, you've got to rest things from time to time when you do a radio show.  I'll give them something to do.  Here's what they could do.  So, argue with the people that say, I love that they're not doing the walkover right now.  And get on a message board and just duke it out anonymously.  Duke it out for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours.  No, because the walkover is part of the show.  No, it's kind of good that they rested.  They're just lazy.  Just fight amongst yourselves.  Have fun.  Is anybody else sick of the Al bit? 
[02:15:30]  I am.  Ladies and gentlemen, the return of Angry Typing Guy.  Congratulations.  I haven't seen him in here in months.  I know I read that one, too.  Anyone else realize that Opie laughs extra long when they dump out of stuff on Free FM?  Ladies and gentlemen, an encore.  Presentation.  And then you've got the smart people that realize why that happens.  It's called stretching.  You've got to stretch because you lose four seconds every time you say cunt or cock or fuckwad. 
[02:16:00]  You're going to get that one, Al.  So, when someone says something unbelievable but then they curse, you have to stretch.  And it's better to maybe laugh a little longer or something else instead of just sitting there going,  Let the teen at the count in your head.  You ever read that shit?  Count in your head.  You read it.  Count in your head.  And then you read somebody, like, you're pissed, kind of.  And then you scroll down a little.  And then there's a guy that makes total sense.  He explains it exactly like it happened and like you would have explained it.  Because he's smart.  He gets it. 
[02:16:30]  Finally, somebody fucking gets it.  Some dickbag the other day wrote,  What?  May I?  Oh, please.  Wait, let me hand it to you.  Here you go.  Wow, it's heavier than I thought.  It's a heavy responsibility.  It's like the Lord of the Rings ring.  I'm holding on to it for a little while.  Uh, why didn't you guys broadcast when you were in Vegas?  You were out for three days and you didn't do a broadcast.  It was like, look at when we had travel days. 
[02:17:00]  We had to fly out and fly back.  And it wasn't a single flight.  It was connecting flights.  When we were there, we had shit to do.  Uh, even though it was just one thing.  It took like all day to do the rehearsal stupid stuff.  And we didn't have a studio.  And if we did, it would have been three hours earlier that we would have broadcast.  So we couldn't have done it that way.  Uh, and then what happens after our broadcast from three in the morning till six?  Who comes on?  A replay of us? 
[02:17:30]  What station are we going to be at to tell the fucking station that we're coming in to do this?  And it's got to be now linked up with all the affiliates.  It logistically didn't work because XM wasn't there.  It didn't work.  And this idiot is mouthing off that we're fucking lazy.  Look, let's just be honest with each other.  But somebody spelt it all out.  Let's be honest with each other.  We're in the calling it in stage of our careers.  Yeah, but it doesn't have to be spelt out.  We didn't need to do a broadcast from Vegas.  Calling it in.  Oh, this is the calling it in stage of our careers. 
[02:18:00]  Well, they complain about this.  May I borrow it?  Well, hand it over to Jimmy.  Yeah.  There you go.  I'll just leave it here.  Yeah.  Why didn't you guys, aren't you sick of the David Caruso bit?  Oh, yeah.  That's another one.  You douchebags.  You know what I noticed?  There are certain, look, certain people just don't like certain bits.  And that's always the case.  That's fine.  But it's like when you hear people, there are certain people that, like,  they're kind of like the left out fans. 
[02:18:30]  I kind of feel like they're, it's just not the same guys.  Yeah.  And, like, things that become running jokes now, they like things that were running jokes  five years ago.  But, like, now, just on principle, anything that's a silly running joke now is wrong.  Stink.  And it's like five years from now, it would be brilliant, great stuff that they remember fondly.  I just, even though at this point in our careers, we're very lazy broadcasters, we still give  the listeners more material on a weekly basis than any other radio show out there. 
[02:19:00]  Of course.  Any other radio show out there.  And here's the reality.  And that's another thing.  Are you sick and tired of OPC reality every time he has to make a point about something?  Wow.  Oh, shut up.  Angry typing guy is just running rampant.  I'll tell you this much.  We could do the CSI bit, even on XM, where the fans are more dedicated.  Yep.  And listen longer.  They listen longer.  Linger longer.  Linger longer over here.  We could do the CSI bit right now. 
[02:19:30]  And there's a ton of people that would call themselves, by the way, faithful listeners of  this show, that would hear it for the first fucking time.  I never have heard it before.  But the hardcore guys would, you know.  I like when they were on NEW the best.  Really?  Do you know that we did the same bit three times in one afternoon?  Because we didn't have anything else to talk about.  We used to replay shit.  You dopes.  We would replay shit three times in a day.  Anthony would do some classic three-minute Reagan bit.  We're like, make him believe it was just the greatest thing ever. 
[02:20:00]  And we would play it three different times.  We'd have excuses why we had to play it three different times in one show.  Play songs sometimes.  Remember sometimes we've just, look, we're going to throw a song on.  Right.  And then we'd just walk out and play foosball.  Yeah.  Because we had nothing.  We're like, you know, the other day I heard this song on the radio.  It brought me back to like roller skating there in Northport.  I want to play this song today.  And it was Green Grass and High Tides Forever.  The live version.  Live version. 
[02:20:30]  It's a 20-minute song.  Right.  And there were some amazingly funny, great, brilliant breaks.  But it's like we ought to play at least one day on XM.  Play a fucking, find a particularly, go to, had nothing to go to break.  Where we were just doing nothing.  Just dreck and filler.  We were there for three years, N.E.W.?  Yeah.  Was it three years?  A little over.  If you take all that best of that people have been listening to for years and years, do  you think it would equal three years' worth of on-air time? 
[02:21:00]  No.  Nowhere's near.  There are classic bits that are funny to listen to today, you know?  I laugh when I listen to it and go, oh, Christ, man, that was some funny shit.  But we've, in the two-plus years we've been at XM, we've given them so much more material  than our three years at N.E.W.  Most time at N.E.W. was exactly like the last ten minutes of this show.  Worthless, useless, babbling.  Oh, yeah, someone else was bitching because I burp.  That just shows that he has nothing to add to the conversation, but he wants to be heard, 
[02:21:30]  so he burps.  Oh, go die.  Was that the tack he was taking on that one?  We don't like pal talk.  And then people like, we don't like message boards.  We don't like this message board.  We don't like pal talk.  We don't like when they talk about the...  Enough.  And by the way, because there's another discussion about another Opie MySpace account, is this  the subtle Opie MySpace account?  No, it's not.  Why would Opie get into MySpace now? 
[02:22:00]  I don't...  I'm not a MySpace fan.  Hey, if there's a pyramid scheme I'd like to invite you in on.  Oh, here it is.  Could this be Opie's low profile, in quotations, MySpace account?  Well, here you go.  Could be.  From the horse's mouth, it's not me.  I mean, it's him, dude.  We'll be shutting down another MySpace account.  Fake Opie MySpace account.  And then...  Oh, another one I read, but it was from a Stern fan, so I'm going to take it for whatever it's  worth, but it was like, my opinion of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:22:30]  Like, he was getting an honest opinion.  And he goes, I don't see what the point is.  I listened.  All I heard was some fat guy in a rabbit suit eating marshmallows and them talking about  CSI.  They suck.  And it was like...  And I'm reading this, scratching my head, just going, this fucking idiot punches in for  like 15 minutes, and he's going to get every joke. 
[02:23:00]  You could take any show out of context.  The most popular fucking TV, radio, a movie, and just chop 15, 10, 15 minutes out of it  and go, this sucks, unless you know the storyline.  Look, I don't want everyone kissing our asses, trust me, but I say it from time to time.  Sometimes we have to lash out.  As far as these message boards, you've got to eat your own, and it would be nice to see  the intelligent people step up a little bit and explain some of these obvious things that  do happen on our show, and the reason why they do happen. 
[02:23:30]  I'll defend them.  They do.  They really do.  I see it from time to time.  It is the minority of people that are real dickbags.  Then eat them and spit them out on the fucking highway.  I think, by the way, the best part of that, what you just said, is that someone called  Eric the fat guy in a bunny suit.  In a rabbit suit.  That just makes me happy.  Fat guy in a rabbit suit.  Amen.  By the way, I'm going to prove my point.  Josh from D.C.  Hey, boys.  Josh, now, if you're bullshitting, tell me right off the bat.  I am certainly not bullshitting you. 
[02:24:00]  You swear to God, right?  I swear to God.  Well, that's good enough for me.  I have been a faithful listener of the Opie and Anthony show since the free trial days  back on XM a couple years ago.  Let's get some info.  How many hours a week would you say you listen to the Opie and Anthony show?  At least 12.  At least two or three hours a day.  That's a newbie, really.  That's like a casual listener.  But okay, 12 hours.  You guys are usually not going to work.  All right.  And say what you're going to say, because I know this. 
[02:24:30]  I know this is true like the back of my hand.  Oh, and then when people, that's another thing people complain about.  And then old pastor tells how long you've been doing, oh, right.  So I've been doing radio a long time, you fucking assholes.  Well, fuck those people.  Jesus Christ.  It's called a reference point.  I know this because I've been doing it this long.  Okay?  All right.  No bullshit.  I've been listening since the free trial days on XM.  And then, and I have not heard the David Caruso bit. 
[02:25:00]  No bullshit.  Not heard it at all.  See?  And I know this is true.  I know this is true.  I know we could do it right now, but we're not.  Don't worry.  But we could do it right now.  And a bunch of people would call up and go, wow, that's pretty funny.  Or that's a good observation.  I've never heard that before.  I'll be on the road for the next hour.  So just do it in the next hour and I'll be happy.  Thanks, sir.  I want to be, I want to be heard by other people, but I don't, I want to use a sigpick. 
[02:25:30]  I want people to hear me.  I want to be respected in the community.  I'm going to pick a sigpick.  I'm going to pick a sigpick.  Why don't you just use your real face?  No.  My voice might see me.  I want to, I'm going to get a funny sigpick.  I do respect the guys that do have their faces.  Of course.  And we're very interactive with the fans. 
[02:26:00]  So, you know, you see them out and about and you know some of the shit they've said about you on the message.  Coke Logic.  I respect that.  Coke Logic, who physically is a disaster.  Comes up to me.  In Chicago.  Is he from the Chicago area?  Yes, he is.  He's stupid to me.  When I see all these guys in Whack Bag, I assume they're all from Long Island.  All New Yorkers, of course.  But also, like Coke Logic, I even know that name.  Comes up to me and he goes, hey man, we're talking because I'm Coke Logic from Whack Bag.  And I'm like, oh shit.  And it was like, I mean, I might not have remembered if he used his face anyway. 
[02:26:30]  What was his physical problem?  The same as every other male listener.  I mean, like the head is normal and then he just glaciers into a larger boy.  But, you know, he did some really, really funny stuff cartoon-wise.  And so we talked for a while.  It was like, cool meeting him.  It was like, that's a guy who I like.  Hey, you feel like you're meeting a celebrity.  And there was another one too.  I'm sorry I'm forgetting the name.  But a lot of them show up and introduce themselves by their message board names.  It's always, it's never the negative ones though.  Like never the ones that are dicks.  It's like, you know, here it is. 
[02:27:00]  The Al Dukes impression.  Can this thing be put to bed or what?  Holy fuck.  The boys have beaten this fucking thing into the ground.  I now can no longer take it.  You hear me, WBL?  Please, no more.  Come on, Al.  And tell Opie too.  Yeah, Opie.  Let me tell you something.  That's Al D from Whack Bag.  And WBL is Anthony's screen name, obviously.  Ripple Bat Lube.  But, um, sometimes we do stuff just to make ourselves laugh. 
[02:27:30]  And hopefully you laugh with us fine.  That Al bit I could do every day.  I think that's hilarious.  I just wrote, okay, will do.  Thanks for the advice.  Anything else?  I'll send you a consulting check right away.  Just, I didn't give him the usual fuck dick, shit ass, cunt bag, mother cunt fuck dick.  Because I get, you know, criticized for that too.  Or, oh, just because he curses, now everybody's got to get behind him.  The brave message board people. 
[02:28:00]  All right.  Most of them are great.  I know.  Most of them are really cool.  In fairness.  Most of them are really cool.  Even ones that, like, bust balls or bitch about bits.  You know me and you are on the same page today?  Also, how weird is that?  Line four saying the exact same thing me and you were saying at the other place about something  you haven't done in a while.  Oh, wow.  Okay, yeah.  How bizarre is that?  Yeah, it's really weird.  And we want it to come out of nowhere.  So, uh, so Jim, thanks for the phone call.  But, uh, Jimmy's going to do that very, very soon.  All right.  Uh, you guys are good because you care about your show.  We absolutely care about our show. 
[02:28:30]  I'm listening to the Wii audio and the boys keep interrupting.  I don't need to hear their opinion every ten seconds.  Shut up and play the audio.  And then there's a poll.  Should this thread be closed before it gets ugly?  I thought it was going to be about the audio.  We played the audio.  Were you here for that, Jimmy?  For the Wii audio?  Yeah, it was chilling stuff.  Oh, then we played it again Friday.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  What's wrong with talking about it?  They didn't like that we were stopping it and commenting.  Here's my...  Maybe expressing what we're feeling as we're listening to this for the first time. 
[02:29:00]  This is good.  This gives a little people insight on the message board because I contribute a lot.  Here's my answer.  Let me get this right.  You want us to just play clips and sit there and listen to them and not say anything.  Isn't that called being a listener?  See, we put on the show.  If we don't say stuff about the stuff we're playing, we'll get fired.  How can I put this...  Oh, see, because it's like our jobs to comment on clips or news stories or phone calls or just life.  How can I put this so you'll understand?  You see, we're the hosts of the show you listen to. 
[02:29:30]  I'm Anthony from the Opie and Anthony show.  You getting any of this?  We have to do certain things that listeners don't have to do.  You can if you want, but you'll look retarded doing it in your car.  They don't understand.  We have to talk about this stuff.  Fast Freddy from...  Or then we're just sitting here listening.  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station.  Everything you've said is correct, but what about the motherfucking black baby audio?  Hey, now you're reminding me. 
[02:30:00]  I said you got to remind me first thing in the morning.  Now the guy's got a point, Opie.  Got a good point.  No one reminded me first thing this morning.  Oh, yeah, this thread.  Wow, Opie has officially gotten on my last nerve.  Ew.  Who the fuck wrote last nerve?  What fat girl wrote that?  He's on my last nerve.  Good, I hope so.  Why does he feel the fucking need...  Oh, oop, I just did what this guy's writing about.  Oops. 
[02:30:30]  Why does he feel the fucking need to talk over everyone,  especially Anthony, as I just talked over you?  We both...  Well, three of us talk over each other.  It's a matter of talking, and then you stop.  Let the other guy go.  Anthony starts doing...  I do that sometimes.  Anthony starts doing an impression,  and then Opie feels the need to do the same impression over Anthony's impression.  I only do that with the owl, because I get excited,  and I'm kind of part of that one.  It's fun to do, owl.  We kind of developed that one together.  Exactly, Pookie. 
[02:31:00]  And then I'm his sidekick when he does the Hillary.  I have to be the audience acting to his speech pattern.  That's not stepping on an impression when you do owl together.  That's a silly part of it.  You guys are both calling owl, owl.  Ow.  Fun.  I can't help it.  Do it, and watch.  I'll try not to do it.  Hey, did you get that one, owl?  I hope you dumped it.  It's going to be trouble.  It's going to be trouble if you didn't dump it, owl.  Right, owl.  Did you get it, owl, right?  Okay, owl.  Dump out of the shit word.  I can't help it. 
[02:31:30]  I have to jump in on that one.  It starts doing something funny, and then Opie just fucking kills the funny out of it.  His laugh, his jokes, his teases, everything about Opie is starting to annoy the fuck out of him.  Now, who is that?  What's his name?  Olive Who.  And how many posts?  Olive Who, you know, that's a very good name to have on the message board.  All right.  Well, it's a good name.  Because it's a funny name.  It's kind of like, it's not your own name.  Right.  They always go, why does he care if we use our names? 
[02:32:00]  Because I do, faggots.  That's why.  I make my living.  Well, I think if you're just kind of like a fun poster, and you're getting silly, and just enjoying the spirit of the show in general,  I don't give a shit if you use a fake name.  But if you're one of these guys that can critique every single part of it, then fucking have your real face up there.  That's a good point.  They're a fucking guy that all they do is fucking pound every little piece of the show.  Every day, it's a critique of one little fucking thing that we did. 
[02:32:30]  I love you.  Love you, message boards.  Mm-hmm.  That's why I like pal talk.  At least there's fucking people showing you their real faces.  When they're not showing you, they're cocks.  Hey.  Yes, they're just showing you that fat stomach and an appendix scar and a rotten brown uncut dick  and a fucking dirty fucking plane steering hand jerking it.  Fucking awful.  Fucking pilot school hand. 
[02:33:00]  A dirty unclipped hog being stroked.  Hold on.  I want to get a compliment in.  We love when people compliment.  Yes, we do.  Tracy, what's up?  How you guys doing?  Hey, you're Tracy?  You've got a girl's name.  More than, more than, I listen to you guys 24-7 because I drive a truck and I'm in and out of it all the time.  All right.  And I miss parts of your show, so I have to listen to you assholes 24-7.  Justin from South Carolina.  What's up?  Hey, how y'all doing this morning? 
[02:33:30]  Pretty good, Justin.  I did know that Jimmy had heard the replay from the interview.  I just turned on the radio about 8.30 this morning.  Oh, the MSNBC interview?  Yes.  What did he think about the focus?  Is it okay we play it one more time?  Is that okay with everybody?  Hey, Opie and Anthony, you guys, you do whatever you want to.  You guys put on a great show.  Thanks.  What do you like about the show, Justin?  Well, I'm... 
[02:34:00]  Doesn't anybody know that?  God, how far...  It's coming at you.  New thread, but the topic's closed.  Are you...  Anybody else sick of them bitching about people bitching?  And they closed the thread.  Why is Wackbag all weird colors?  Why do they do that sometimes?  They're in, like, battle mode. 
[02:34:30]  They're in, yeah, too much traffic mode so it doesn't load pictures and people can still communicate.  They're in battle mode?  Why?  Because we're talking about it, so it's getting pounded right now.  Yeah, it's very important to keep it open at all times.  Fair enough.  Because we're solving the world's problems.  Oh, very important broadcast.  MSNBC interview.  Yes, Jimmy, what have you heard about this thing so far?  I heard...  I forgot about it until I was away, and somebody mentioned it, and I heard part of it. 
[02:35:00]  I did not hear all of it.  And what I heard, I really...  You know, I actually heard of it.  Somebody sent me either an instant message or an email.  It's not important.  And I heard quite a laugh out of it.  Yes, Jimmy called me.  He said it was funny.  I felt thrilled.  Yeah, I just...  I love the fact...  You didn't call me, though.  And, um...  I did talk to you.  Yeah, but not after you heard the phone call.  No, it wasn't right after.  No, it wasn't right after. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, all right.  And I didn't hear the whole thing.  I heard part of it.  I heard it.  It was called, whatever happened.  Only Anthony's funny part is what you heard?  No, I actually...  No, no, no.  Let me explain.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Some of these bits need a straight man.  You were getting the information out there.  It was important.  Why does Anthony even need him at this point?  Shut the fuck up.  You dicks.  Do you get anything in life? 
[02:36:00]  That's why I said that to you.  It's only worked for a dozen years.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  It's just mind-boggling.  It really is.  I don't, again, it doesn't even bother me if someone shits on the show  as much as it does when they try to come off like they're in the know.  Yeah.  It's like, stop it.  You don't know what you're talking about.  You're a fat guy who just has some shit job that you're not happy with.  Yeah.  Complain about that.  Critique that.  Yeah, just squash some of these people for me. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, when they speak for everybody.  When they go, you know, no one is finding this funny anymore.  Are they really representative of everybody?  Well, that was the Rich and Bonnie show, so maybe you need a...  Well, yeah.  A better example.  Was it bad?  Oof.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What happened with the Rich and Bonnie show?  Well, let's just put it this way.  It was so bad that Rich actually had to say,  look, those guys have been doing it for 10 years.  We've been doing it for 10 minutes.  Oh, no, he didn't say that. 
[02:37:00]  Do we have any audio of that?  Can you guys find the clip where he goes, look,  he couldn't take the complaints anymore.  Oh, please, the meltdown.  So he goes, look, here's the deal.  Opie and Anthony have been doing this for 10 years.  We've been at it for 10 minutes.  Oh, great.  Oh, is that fantastic?  Oh, fuck.  That is the worst thing you could do is meltdown, man,  because then they just smell blood.  That's what made me laugh.  They smell blood and fucking go. 
[02:37:30]  He felt like he was backed into a corner.  MSNBC, yeah, so the we, hold your we for a wee.  By the way, this is breaking news, very exciting for everybody in the radio world.  Howard Stern will be on David Letterman discussing the hold your we for a wee thing.  Wow.  You're kidding, right?  No.  But he was just on Letterman.  We should have put the list of all the people we said no to.  They went right at us.  We're like, no. 
[02:38:00]  And we did the MSNBC thing as a joke, obviously.  Didn't take it seriously?  I don't understand what there is to discuss about it.  He's desperate.  He's even hinting he might get married.  Just anything to get his stupid name in the paper at this point.  But what is there to discuss about on Letterman?  Especially now.  Everything's pretty much discussed.  It's out of the news.  He'll talk about his imitators and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:38:30]  Dave will do the pen tap and go, so what happened?  So what do you got going?  Well, Dave, I have the show, which is just phenomenally successful.  My nose is growing what?  All right.  MSNBC.  We fired some people down at Sirius because of financial problems, and I got $85 million.  What a dick.  A bonus.  What a dick.  Really?  Yeah. 
[02:39:00]  It's firing people.  They had some firings down there.  From his, what, Howard 100 News or whatever?  Yeah.  Right after he got an $85 million.  Penny Crone, who's a legendary New York broadcaster.  She went to work for him, and he can't afford to pay her, so he fired her.  You're kidding, right?  Right after he got an $85 million bonus.  Yeah, it hit the paper that he got an $85 million bonus.  Penny Crone, I know her name.  Howard TV, I know they do all his interviews and stuff like that, and the show recaps.  Penny Crone's kind of, um...  She's a tough broad.  Did she suck and deserve to get fired, or was it like a financial thing? 
[02:39:30]  No.  The Howard 100 News thing isn't working.  Wow.  A lot of the things on that channel aren't working.  All right.  So, MSNBC...  Do we need to do this again?  I would like to hear it, to be honest with you.  I would like to.  I'll play it one more time.  I heard part of it.  If I heard the whole thing...  How long is it?  It's three minutes.  Oh, yeah.  I want to hear it.  All right.  Ding for the show references.  So we decided we're not going to take this interview seriously at all, although I try to get some stock answers. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, but if you don't actually give real answers, they're just going to disconnect you.  Oh, no.  That's clowning off.  It's not going to work.  Yeah, we knew that going into it.  I said, look, I'll just give stock answers, stuff that any stupid DJ would say, and then Ant would have fun with all the references.  And the very, very important case that happened back in 1983.  Yes, yes.  We all remember it.  The Sacramento County Sheriff's Department has opened a criminal investigation into the death of a California woman 
[02:40:30]  who drank too much water.  Jennifer Strange drank as much as two gallons of water during a radio show stunt to win a popular gaming system.  The sheriff is considering filing charges after hearing part of the radio show broadcast.  How much water do you think you can drink before you have to wee?  I do like two gallons.  Two gallons?  Oh, dude.  Can't you get water poisoning and like die?  No water.  Your body is 98% water.  Why can't you take in as much water as you want? 
[02:41:00]  I don't know.  Maybe we should have researched this.  I don't know.  I mean, yeah.  Maybe we should have researched that more.  Shortly after that part of the conversation on January 12th, a nurse called in warning of the dangers of drinking too much water.  Not a lot.  We can pick this part a little bit.  Allison Stewart, after that clip, goes, yeah, maybe you should have researched it a little more.  Yeah.  If that wasn't foretelling.  I know.  Maybe you should have researched us a little more.  Right.  And they called us out on it.  Like listen to that day's show where we talked about how we were going to do just this.  Right. 
[02:41:30]  This wasn't exactly the invasion of Normandy kept secret.  Right.  We were blabbing about it all day.  This wasn't Pearl Harbor.  This was a –  Yeah.  We pretty much said we're going to do an interview, but I'm going to try to get in as many show references as possible.  And if you were listening to the show, you'd have heard that.  We took suggestions from the listeners that day.  Yeah.  Help us get it all set for later that day, later that morning, whatever.  Conversation on January 12th.  A nurse called in warning of the dangers of drinking too much water.  The radio station has now fired 10 employees, including three of the morning show disc jockeys. 
[02:42:00]  Openie and Anthony are nationally syndicated radio hosts, also on XM Satellite Radio, two of the best known in the business.  They're joining us now on the phone.  Guys, thank you so much for joining us today.  Thanks for having us, Allison.  Hey, Opie, so as two people who do provocative radio for a living, what did you think when you first heard this story about this woman dying from drinking that much water during this stunt?  Well, obviously, I feel bad for Jennifer and her family, but I also feel bad for the show because they're just kind of a wacky morning show. 
[02:42:30]  They're not really shock jocks or edgy.  They were just kind of having a little fun and a little kind of peaceful, obviously.  That was great about that.  I gave the perfect stock answer where she's probably like, oh, this is great.  Oh, this is great.  It's a good start to the interview.  Yeah.  It's a coup to have these guys because they're in that shock jock genre.  And it's weird.  They're not calling them shock jocks.  It's like, this is a wacky show.  It kind of fell into something a little too deep.  And, okay, yeah, this is working.  I don't feel bad because she introduced us as Openy, Openy, Openy, and Anthony. 
[02:43:00]  There's something with that, dude.  Openy, Openy, Openy, Openy, Openy, Openy, Openy.  People can get it.  Openy and Anthony.  You know, maybe when people read, it's natural to read very quickly from left to right.  We're so used to reading quickly, like, jump in, Openy, like, because Anthony.  Open, Opie, O, Anthony, Openy.  That would be cool to get a montage of people saying our names wrong from the media because Jay Leno did it.  Oh, yeah, that would be cool.  Nelson Stewart did it.  There's a few more out there.  It might be something that's worth it.  Openy and Anthony, Openy and Anthony, Openy and Anthony, that would be a great way to open the show. 
[02:43:30]  Just have a bunch of those people saying our names wrong.  That's very funny.  Openy and Anthony.  25, 30 of them.  Openy and Anthony, Openy and Anthony, yes.  See, I just justified my pay.  There you go.  With an idea.  God forbid.  I'm going to have a little fun in it.  A little kind of face fun.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  I feel bad.  Anthony, what did you think when you first heard this?  It was awful. 
[02:44:00]  You know, these poor kids of the mother are going to be asked for the rest of their life, you know, how would your parents die?  You know, or your parents die, and they're going to have to come up with this ridiculous story of, you know, a radio stunt.  So, Opie, so what?  Now she's on.  So, Opie, what had your parents die?  Now she's thinking in her head, all right, Opie gave me, like, a really good answer, whatever, what I needed.  Yeah.  Went to Anthony.  Something is up.  She doesn't really know what's up.  Like, what?  How'd your parents die? 
[02:44:30]  Maybe I should go back to my comfort zone.  Opie seems to be the one that's helping me out.  Now, Opie, give me a good answer.  Anthony is not making much sense.  Well, then I have the hum-and-a-hum-and-a-hum-and-a moment coming up.  Anthony sounds drunk.  Just drunk.  So, Opie, so what at this point in the story, if anything, points to the radio host's responsibility for this woman's death or absolves him from it?  That's a good question.  It's going to be tough to get out of this one. 
[02:45:00]  You really don't sign up to kill a listener when you do a radio show.  So, I'd say they're pretty screwed.  Yeah, I was listening to you guys this morning, and you played a clip from this show.  Oh, she gets a little cockiness, I noticed.  Ah, listening.  I was listening.  Were you?  You missed the whole part when we talked about how we were going to do this?  I was listening.  I'm on the same page as you.  You can hear it in her attitude.  Well, she signed a release.  Yeah. 
[02:45:30]  It's one of my favorite parts.  Listen.  Yeah, I was listening to you guys this morning, and you played a clip from this show, and one of the guys was like,  Hey, she signed a release.  Does that, she signed a release excuse hold, in your opinion?  No, I think legally it might hold, so they don't get arrested.  But I think a civil case will be brought up.  And it reminds me, it was a case years ago, back in 83, a couple of disc jockeys.  I think it was Ramon and Frankis in the morning. 
[02:46:00]  They had a staff member shove marshmallows in his mouth, and he choked wearing a bunny suit.  It was awful, tragic.  The Nagel family's never recovered from that.  And, you know, I remember they were taken right off the air.  Sophie, he did not what happened to them legally.  No.  She didn't ask any questions about the Ramon and Frankis case.  No, Ramon and Frankis show.  And the greatest, because she said she was listening that morning, we ended our show with, you know, Iraq in the bunny suit, stuffing marshmallows in his fat face. 
[02:46:30]  And she's like, yeah, they got fired.  I'll be, I'll be, save me, please.  I'll be.  And now this is where I let her down, too, because I'm listening to this.  I know we've said this, but I'm saying for Jimmy, because he was in Chicago.  I go, uh, I'm listening, I'm like, oh, my God, he did not.  And then I'm laughing inside, and I'm, like, kind of covering up the phone.  Forgetting her question.  And now she's asking me a question.  I have no clue, but I picked up on a couple of keywords, and then, like, my brain slowly got back to giving her something. 
[02:47:00]  Listen how long it takes from the time she asks the question till Opie actually spits out something intelligible.  It's just a bunch of, ah, da, um, and, uh, well, ar, oh.  So, Opie, do you think this is going to bring any, any industry-wide changes, or is this just going to be one of these sad stories that sort of fades from the headlines eventually?  Uh, no, I think, uh, I think, I think the boss is going to, you know, uh, kind of, kind of. 
[02:47:30]  What the fuck are you talking about?  I think, uh, I think, you know, the boss is kind of, uh, well, I'm amazed that the interview is going on.  I'm like, he did not.  I'm laughing.  I'm going to hum it.  I'm assuming, I'm assuming end of interview, and now she's still asking questions.  I'm like, is this really happening?  She's continuing?  Reagan gave more coherent answers during the Iran-Contra hearing.  Yes, I don't recall.  By the way, your, the answer is almost 10 seconds. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, almost 10 seconds.  You were just stammering.  Industry-wide changes, or is this just going to be one of these sad stories that sort of fades from the headlines eventually?  Uh, no, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think the boss is going to, you know, uh, kind of, kind of, kind of, pretty much, uh, wreck it for everybody else.  I mean, the bosses in radio in general are beyond scared as it is.  And, uh, now that we officially have killed the listener out there, yeah, I, I think you're going to hear a lot of really, really boring radio.  No one's going to really try to go to the, go to the edge or, uh, do anything edgy. 
[02:48:30]  Well, Anthony...  Didn't, uh, didn't, uh, management maybe say, hey, did you talk to a doctor about this or something, and maybe, uh, get some confirmation if this is dangerous or not?  So, Anthony, you're throwing it up the food chain a little bit, that management maybe should get involved and maybe should be held accountable.  Yeah, maybe you say, you know, did you talk to a doctor about this or something, you know?  Can you, wait, here's the problem about that.  You fucking do the same non-Anthony accent twice at the same, and she doesn't catch on. 
[02:49:00]  Did you talk to your doctor?  Did you talk to your doctor?  That's going way back to N.E.W., that's Psycho Mark, uh, doing his commercial read for Stacker 2.  He used to go, did you talk to your doctor about Stacker 2?  Have we found that commercial?  It would have been great to just play that one.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Because he was always Psycho Mark, ah, these guys, I don't, these fucking people are crazy.  And then he'd read copy, and it would be like, hey, you ordered Stacker 2, talk to your doctor about it.  Put on his smooth, slick voice.  Anthony, you're throwing it up the food chain a little bit, that management maybe should get involved, 
[02:49:30]  and maybe should be held accountable.  Yeah, maybe you say, you know, did you talk to your doctor about this or something, you know?  Maybe management should have looked into this and seen if it was a little more dangerous than they thought.  Opie and Anthony, we really thank you for taking the time to be with us today.  Thank you, Allison.  Thank you.  Allison.  Funny.  Got to slip into Allison.  That's funny.  It's very funny. 
[02:50:00]  Then my phone went click, and that was it.  I didn't get that.  Guys, you were great.  If we have anything else on this, we'd love to give you a call and have you involved.  And it was click.  Click.  Bam.  Maybe because you didn't say one thing that helped or made sense.  Nothing I said made any sense.  He started off strong and then just stammered, and you're in eight different voices.  What a dissent.  Just talking about things that have nothing to do with our questions. 
[02:50:30]  Talking about the Nagel family being upset that their young boy died choking in a bunny suit.  The Nagel family's never recovered.  Never recovered.  How great is that?  Mr. Torrance, help us out.  I can't find your instant feedback.  Who else hates when Opie all of a sudden says, oh, it updated?  Well, it did.  Wow.  Isn't that funny?  Because then it updated.  You couldn't find it.  Yeah, I can't find it.  But supposedly another Fox show over the weekend was making fun of us. 
[02:51:00]  Does anyone have anything on that?  Oh, yeah?  Mr. Torrance.  Fox show?  Yeah, one of the Fox weekend talk shows on TV.  I guess we're talking about this Hold Your Wee for Wee, and they were making fun of us.  Mr. Torrance, if you got anything on that, please send another email.  How could you make fun of us?  Exactly.  I don't get it.  This show is goof-proof.  How do I go to the first?  Oh, now you don't know how to. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, boy.  Let me try this.  I hate when Opie can't work the instant feedback.  Let me try this.  Let me sit here.  Yeah, I can't find him.  It's just another fucking XM show they're phoning in.  Oh, yeah.  And yet, meanwhile, they'll say, like, back at the NAW days, it was great when they just hung out and talked.  Yeah.  You can't win.  What?  There's no winning.  There's no winning.  I have a rod right now.  Ooh.  All right.  How'd that happen?  I don't know.  His fan marched in, all unshaven, looking like he takes charge. 
[02:52:00]  That'll do it.  Hey, how can I get this, like, updated?  Your thingy's broke.  I gotta go to my fucking dentist.  Oh, you gotta get that thing fixed.  Yeah, I gotta go today.  Today?  Right above, right above.  Upstairs?  Yeah.  Fucking.  What's he doing?  I don't know.  Creepy Zell up there.  Zell?  He answered his own phone when I called before.  Who answers it?  What dentist answers their own phone?  No dentist.  They have a receptionist that does that. 
[02:52:30]  Hello, Dr. So-and-so's office.  That means he's not doing too well.  No, he's doing horribly.  He's probably laid off.  Which means he's got a couple lawsuits that he's dealing with.  Reusing needles.  Right.  He probably touched someone inappropriately.  Some fucking boyish-looking man in his mid-30s, which fits my description.  I'm very boyish.  He was filling your cavity, and he was hoping you were gonna fill his.  Oh.  Instead of paying.  Oh, come on.  Well, you're out.  Oh, wow.  Lindsay didn't like that.  Lindsay in Arizona.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  That was a little too harsh. 
[02:53:00]  Hi.  Oh, you know, I just didn't see it coming.  You know, the anal cavity jokes, they always get ya.  Yeah.  Dentist ass sex is where you draw the line, right?  Yeah, you know, you think of, like, sharp tools and anal sex in the same sentence is  a little freaky.  That's where you part company.  Have you ever had anything up your poop chute?  Um, you know, no.  And actually, I was thinking about that, because I was thinking about the show when you had  the old couple from Georgia, and you were trying to get her to tell you why she wouldn't  have butt sex.  Yeah, the ass sex.  Well, that guy was hung.  Yeah, I thought, God, I wouldn't.  Oh, he was fucking, I heard. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, he was hung.  Of course she didn't have that, her poop chute.  You know what, though?  I think he was intimidated, because he was in love with Jimmy.  You think?  Oh, God, yeah.  Are you kidding me?  He wanted him, he wanted Jimmy to slap him in the face with his cock.  Seriously?  Probably.  He kind of sounded like you.  He would have taken a cock to the face.  Oh, he would have.  I love the slap show on my cock right now.  Well, you got Flea out there.  I mean, he's up for anything.  He's not slapping if the mouth stays open.  All right, so what's up, Lindsay?  You know, I just wanted to call and tell you guys that, like, I hate talk shows usually, 
[02:54:00]  but I drive for two hours every morning and two hours every night to get to and from  work, and you guys are the fucking shit.  Thank you.  You're just awesome.  Yeah, but we don't, you know what, we don't have a lot of females that listen to the Opie and  Anthony show.  You know, I know.  What does a female like in the Opie and Anthony show?  Like, what do you find funny about the show as a female?  Well, you know, I'm always...  Oh, you must have missed that segment, Lindsay.  I, uh... 
[02:54:30]  Two hours in, two hours, she's driving, she's listening.  She never realizes when he says that.  What, is she the same bit on loop, or does she just, like, always think that there's a  bad problem with the phone?  She's probably still talking.  Yeah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  It's a secret I have.  Because everyone likes to think they're the one that I want to let them do.  That you really want to hear what is good about the show.  I think they all know the bit, but they're like, you know what, he does that because they're  just dumb.  Yeah.  He obviously wants to hear what I have to say. 
[02:55:00]  He really wants to hear what I have to say, because what I have to say is very click.  Hi.  My mom always tells me, when bad things happen, I need to find a happy place.  Like when my Uncle Henry crawls in bed with me and kisses my neck and licks my ear, I think  of Obie and Anthony.  That's my most happy place.  Obie and Anthony!  Oh, what's up? 
[02:55:30]  Lindsay from Arizona.  Yeah, boys.  You totally got me, you bastard.  Yeah.  Oh, we got you with that hang-up gag.  Oh, you got me.  You know, I even thought coming to us, like, if they say that, I'm going to hang up before  they can.  And then I fell right into it.  Well, hmm.  Well, now that you're brave enough to call back the show, obviously, we got to find out  what you like about the show.  For real, what do you like?  Well, you know, I'm not going to tell you for real, but you know my favorite part? 
[02:56:00]  Which, no, she's going to hang up on us now.  Yeah.  She almost got you.  I know.  So easy.  I stop.  I stop.  I stop.  I stop.  Look.  All right.  Whatever.  If anyone gives a shit.  I really stink.  I got to say.  All excited.  I stop, see?  Look how smart I am.  I know our own bits, see?  Flea is one of the most annoying in-studio guests we've ever had. 
[02:56:30]  During commercial break, he was by the window waving.  So I wave back, and he starts pointing at things, like, I don't know what the fuck he's  talking about, and I don't care.  So I think he was trying to get on the Pal Talk camera.  So it's just like, yeah, move over there.  It's over there.  Like, you'll be able to be seen.  Right.  And then, as we're relaxing, you know how we just kind of hang out and sit back and do  nothing?  I'm like leaning back in my chair during the commercial break. 
[02:57:00]  Like, yeah, during the commercial break, I'm just kind of sitting here with my hands on  my stomach.  I look over.  He's by the fucking window with his camera, like, snapping pictures of us when we're just  fucking kind of sitting around.  And this ain't candid fucking camera.  Camera.  Take a couple pictures and move on.  Candid camera.  Like, you took pictures at the walkover.  That's fine.  We expect that we're on over there.  There's this studio audience thing.  And while we're, like, talking and on.  But when we're just kind of hanging out, it's like, I want to just come in the bathroom and 
[02:57:30]  take a picture of my cock while I'm pissing.  In your mouth.  Really?  In your fucking mouth.  Super.  I want that.  I want the pictures that he took deleted.  Unless they're good shots.  You should look at them first.  No, I want the ones that I don't care if they're good shots.  The ones that he was taking through the window of just hanging out in here.  Delete it immediately.  Iraq, use some muscle.  I want that fucking camera.  Sonny Corleone.  Threaten to step on his foot, Eric.  Like, fucking throw it.  There's a commotion going on out there.  Fucking FBI.  Look at what we make Iraq to do. 
[02:58:00]  Now, Poe's over there.  Look what we make Iraq to do just to look at it.  Can we put a mic on out there?  Flea's a fan.  Yeah, get that mic on.  Flea isn't a fan.  He's a fucking asshole.  What's up, Flea?  I just don't want Opie to smash it.  Now you're going to smash it.  You're not going to smash it, but there's a way.  Delete, like, the last couple of pictures.  Well, let's see them.  There's ones that are from outside.  Then there's ones through the window.  Let's see them before you do it.  Yeah, let's take a look.  Let's take a look-see. 
[02:58:30]  Could you have...  That one deleted.  Wow.  Let me see it, Eric.  If you delete it, I'll smash you.  Why would he take that?  You look like a doddering idiot.  I'm fucking, like, leaning back.  I'm like...  I like it.  I got a belly full of fruit and smoothie.  I'm fucking, like, leaning back.  I'm looking at pal talk.  I'm fucking...  And he's snapping fucking creepy pictures of me.  You fucking cunt.  What is that one of?  Who is that?  Jimmy.  Let me see it. 
[02:59:00]  It's the back of Jimmy's head.  That first one, you're sitting there like that fucking old Don in Godfather 2 before he gets a knife in the belly.  I like that.  Actually, look, I have a chin.  Keep that one.  Is it...  They're awful pictures.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  They're just terrible.  Just delete them.  Oh, they're useless.  We're kind of goofing off today, but there is a...  Proves these here pictures.  There is an interesting story out there that might affect Anthony.  I want to get his take on it.  It's Matt from Pittsburgh.  Matt?  Yeah, how you guys doing? 
[02:59:30]  Hey, Matt.  Hey, Matt.  Hey, just real quick.  I just want to tell you, my roommate in D.C. said Bill Burr killed last night at the improv.  That's good to hear.  Yeah, he was down in Washington all weekend.  Cool.  Yeah, Fred said it.  I just want to tell you, Anthony, I heard on CNN today that the government's going to be confiscating bank records trying to find offshore gambling sites.  I don't know if you've heard anything about that.  I read this, too, on FARC.com.  Very fine site.  They have nothing better to do than go after guys like you?  Department of Justice.  Well, what they're going after right now are bank records of banks that have done dealings with the companies, with the online gambling companies. 
[03:00:00]  So Deutsche Bank and another couple of foreign banks, some domestic banks that have done business with these gambling sites.  They're looking into their records, I think, to see how much influence the banks had on these gambling sites.  But doing that, they're going to also have access to who's been using bank cards, debit cards, things like that to finance their accounts on there and who's been gambling. 
[03:00:30]  Now, what they're going to do in the future with this information, who knows?  But what the fuck is the Department of Justice doing?  It's an offshore – they have no jurisdiction internationally what these people are doing with the gambling sites.  But they're jumping in, sticking their nose in when there's shit that we've got to really worry about in this country.  But the Department of Justice figures, you know, online gambling is the big fucking problem. 
[03:01:00]  Who – can we find out, like, who is it that is actually pushing this?  Yeah, who is the big – believe me, it's a lot of these.  That's all that one-fine gambling sites themselves.  It's unbelievable.  Just let people online gamble.  Can we fucking just play some –  Especially stupid poker.  At night, it's so fucking just – you just lay down in bed, you've got the laptop on, you're just playing a fucking couple of hands of poker.  It's your business.  You're done.  It's – yeah.  And somebody said – I read in the comments there, a lot of people comment on Fark when they put a story up. 
[03:01:30]  And one person said, and Opie's talked about it before, and I think it was because of a comic, we're not free in this country.  No.  America is the furthest thing from freedom.  It's, you know, we have a lot of opportunity in this country.  It's a very wealthy country.  It's a great place to live.  I'm not knocking the United States of America, believe me.  But I'm saying we're not fucking free to do things.  We do a whole bit on that, man. 
[03:02:00]  We're free to do what the government tells us we're free to do.  Period.  Go out there with a gun in a city and try to go find supper.  In the city?  Go out anywhere.  Go out unless you're in a specific area that is meant for hunting.  Let me take my shotgun out in the woods of northern Long Island and just start blasting away at living animals.  I will be fucking arrested.  I don't have the freedom to do that.  I don't have the freedom to get on my computer and gamble online. 
[03:02:30]  That's not my freedom.  You're free to do what the government tells you you're free to do.  It's not true freedom.  It's just the way it is.  And, you know, that's fucking shitty.  It's not a good thing.  All right, well.  And we can just keep giving away more and more freedoms every fucking year.  Just more of them go down the shitter.  And you don't think about it.  We're going to be in Venezuela soon. 
[03:03:00]  What's that?  We're going to turn into Venezuela pretty soon here.  Yeah, that's a nice situation, huh?  Why?  Is that Chavez?  Because Chavez is now.  So there's a whole thing going on down in Venezuela where they want to give him, like, fucking just sweeping powers, like the Fuhrer powers.  And the United States commented, like, hey, I don't think this is a good thing, you know, to give this guy this type of dictatorship power.  And he just said, go to hell, gringos, to America.  Go to hell, gringos. 
[03:03:30]  Go to hell.  And then a nice little racist remark.  Yeah, he called Condoleezza Rice.  Yeah, what did he call Condoleezza Rice?  His little girl.  His little girl, he called her.  And he's upset because Citgo, which is his petroleum, goes to Citgo stations.  And apparently people are catching on.  If you've got to get gas, try to skip by the Citgos and go to some other savage station.  Yeah.  Because, I mean, this guy is blatantly anti-U.S.  He wants to have a complete, like, communist government down there, some kind of dictatorship like Castro's got. 
[03:04:00]  So he's changing the name of Citgo to some kind of Petro-something different name that, you know, try to confuse people.  But try to figure out what the name is and just don't frequent those stations.  Yeah, Chavez is a piece of shit.  He really is the little dictator.  But he's one of these guys who's going to be a lot of fucking trouble.  Not really.  In Venezuela, the four of us could kick the dog shit out of the military. 
[03:04:30]  They got a lot of fucking oil.  They got a lot of fucking oil.  In their hair, grease balls.  Fuck them.  All right, Matt, thank you.  Good point, sir.  Good point.  Hey, guys, stay warm.  Yeah, we will.  We will.  All right.  When the mics are off or Travis doing Musical Adventure Hour.  Wow.  That is a choice of shit.  Musical Adventure Hour.  What the fuck is it? 
[03:05:00]  Sam is saying thumbs up with Musical Adventure Hour because it involves us trashing Travis,  which Sam just loves.  We got the best shit on the radio every weekend here on 202.  Oh, my God, the weekends.  Well, I don't want to steal credit.  Musical Adventure Hour was a fan's idea.  Was it?  The name was his idea.  Why wouldn't it be?  The show was my idea.  Is this part of the Razzle Dazzle Variety Hour?  Yeah.  What are we calling the weekend programming here? 
[03:05:30]  The Razzle Dazzle Variety Hour.  The Razzle Dazzle Variety Hour.  Wow.  Oh, does that stink?  Razzle Dazzle.  Oh, is there a little thing for it?  A little sounder for it or something?  There's different imaging for each show, but it's all, it's this weekend on the Razzle  Dazzle Variety Hour.  Oh, okay.  Good, good.  Wow.  You're that guy.  Oh, that's so cool.  You're the douche I want to punch in the face.  Razzle Dazzle.  Oh, that is horrid.  Oh, wow.  I love it.  Do we have the intro for the Travis Musical Adventure Hour? 
[03:06:00]  Musical Adventure.  Now, this sounds like it's, um, you're taking some chances.  Yeah, I sure am.  It's not, it's not, yeah, I sure am.  Yeah, I sure am.  It's not just like Travis and playing music.  It's adventure.  So, like, you know, you're taking an adventure.  You don't know what's going to pop out around the corner.  You have no idea.  Could it be Kajagoogoo?  Or is it going to be some fucking fish?  Like, what the fuck?  It's an adventure.  It's like being on safari.  Is that what the theme was?  Is it basically you want to play kind of like an eclectic bunch of stuff? 
[03:06:30]  No, pretty much what it was was no adventure whatsoever.  No adventure.  Straight and narrow.  No adventure in his adventure.  Hey, hey, we're getting reviews coming in.  Hold on a second.  Tom in Philly.  What's up, Tom?  Hey, boys.  Good morning.  Good morning, Tom.  Razzle Dazzle.  Razzle Dazzle.  I listened to the Razzle Dazzle right here.  It was much better than the Valsam Body show, for one thing.  And when Sam asked Travis if he was a cutter because he played Jimmy Eat World, it was one 
[03:07:00]  of the funniest things I'd ever heard.  Oh.  All right, cool.  He said, you could talk to us.  You don't have to listen to Jimmy Eat World.  Don't cut yourself.  Oh, good.  We got four and a half minutes of audio from Travis's musical adventure hour.  Do you backsell songs?  No, the premise is pretty much one of the staff members behind the scenes plays music and the 
[03:07:30]  rest of us just comment on it.  And the bit is just us trashing each other.  Oh, hold on.  It's almost like a mystery science theater with music.  Yeah, but we don't keep the mics on while the music's on.  All right.  I don't get it.  Because we want to...  It's between songs because we don't want to...  We want to give the music its fair shot.  Okay.  So we're just yapping over the whole thing.  So then when the song ends, are you in mid-conversation?  Have you been talking through the music?  We try to save the gold for between. 
[03:08:00]  Save the gold.  Very good.  And then when it comes on and it's everything from trashing each other to what?  To saying, hey, that wasn't half bad.  Ah.  And then, you know, every week it's the different person.  This weekend will be Danny.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Let's hear the show opener for the musical adventure hour.  What is the musical adventure hour?  Yeah.  It's kind of like walking in on your buddy singing Top 40 songs in the shower 
[03:08:30]  and then realizing he's got a bottle of conditioner up his ass while he's doing it.  Oh, my goodness.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's just like that.  Steve took a little page out of his own book there, huh?  That's right.  With the conditioner model.  I'm surprised you didn't specify brand.  I like our singing of the songs at the beginning. 
[03:09:00]  That was nice.  I didn't realize.  We got a little.  All right.  We got everything in there.  We got some samples from this fine show featuring Travis this past Saturday night.  It's featuring Travis, but everyone else is involved?  Right.  So now next week is Danny, but what is it?  Like a moderator?  Obviously, Travis is in, you know, you're throwing him under the bus.  Next week, it's going to be Danny being pretty much thrown under the bus.  Did you pick the music?  Yes.  Why is this so hard for me to understand?  I don't know.  Dude, he, when you put yourself out there with musical taste or any type of taste. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, okay.  He picked the music.  Your friends beat you up.  They beat you up about the music.  Yes.  All right.  Thanks for fucking telling me.  Just holy cunt.  No one told me.  Just like our show, you put yourself out there and say, hey, I like certain, you know,  such and such song.  Next thing you know, the listeners are calling you a faggot and blah, blah.  That's the same concept.  Like, I thought they played some fucking song, came back, and someone would go, Travis is  skinny and a faggot.  No.  Like, I didn't know it was about the music.  They're making fun of him and his musical taste.  Now it ties in the music.  But also, then, I hope you play the other side where all of a sudden you guys are like, 
[03:10:00]  yeah, that one isn't that bad.  Oh, sure.  So it doesn't sound forced.  All right.  All right.  Now it makes sense.  Here's the intro with Travis.  Finally, holy shit, from this past Saturday.  What's your first song?  You want to guess?  No.  Bouncing Souls.  Yep.  How did I know?  Probably my favorite band.  I'm going to eat some salad.  No.  So, this is the headphones on when you're playing the music.  No, I'm going to turn the mic so you can still hear it on the monitor. 
[03:10:30]  Go ahead.  All right.  This is True Believers by The Bouncing Souls.  Why isn't it funny?  You suck.  Instead of The Bouncing Souls, you retard.  Oh, my God.  I've got to listen to this every weekend.  Wow.  This is an adventure.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Can we lock the doors in the studio when we leave on Friday?  What does a Bouncing Soul sound like?  What the fuck goes on here when we're home sleeping or partying or driving Lamborghinis?  I don't know.  There's a lot of stuff going on on the weekend. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, wow.  That's great.  What are the Bouncing Souls?  It's the Razzle Dazzle hour, for God's sake.  I'm a punk rock.  Can we hear a little True Believers?  And by the way, Razzle Dazzle, his show had neither.  Razzle Dazzle.  Do you see Steve rubbing a little Bacitracin into a tat this morning?  Yeah.  He's so fucking cool.  This is like opera. 
[03:11:30]  Okay, one of these.  Like a soundtrack from every Molly Ringwald movie.  Yeah, this is a little retro. 
[03:12:00]  Wait, you guys taped this, too?  People are saying you've got to do it live, so as you get involved.  We've got three weeks in the can already.  Oh, really?  They're not bad.  No, they're fine.  The only problem is the sound of the voices, but it's too low.  The vocals are mixed low, but it is good.  All right, here we have another clip from the Musical Adventure Hour with Travis.  All right, that was Lucky Denver Mint by Jimmy Eat World. 
[03:12:30]  Does Jimmy Eat World kind of help you when...  Jimmy Eat's dick.  That's what Jimmy eats.  When your parents don't understand where you're coming from, do you put on some Jimmy Eat World  and they kind of get you a little more?  It's funny.  What a cunt you are.  Yeah, I was going to say that sounded like...  God damn.  Sam is the worst.  Do your parents get you more?  Do they get you more?  Oh.  That's good.  ...a little more, because your parents just...  They don't get you.  No, my parents get me. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, I was going to say that sounded like it should be rolling over the end credits of  some teen coming-of-age movie.  Say anything.  Yeah, exactly.  Travis, are you a cutter?  No.  If you are, you can talk to us.  You don't have to listen to Jimmy Eat World.  They're good, and they have a large fan base.  What else do you have off the soundtrack to the OC?  I have nothing.  One of those two things is true.  I've never watched the OC.  That song's been playing every time I've ever walked into Hot Topic.  Dude, you should watch the OC.  You'd dig the music.  And relate to the strike of the people.  I think Fox is recording this show so they can put together their OC season whatever soundtrack. 
[03:13:30]  OC's getting canceled.  Oh, that's a shame.  I wish this show would get canceled.  He's vicious.  He sure is.  Sam's vicious.  The evil cherub.  So now you get what this show's about.  Yeah, you guys are up to something.  Yeah, I completely understand now.  You gotta do it live so the listeners can pop in.  It's the illusion that it was live.  That was actually really good. 
[03:14:00]  Epic.  Triumphant.  That was really shitty.  I've never heard a worse song.  That song made me more angry than anything.  Yeah, me too.  You know, I like that we're really getting to see the depth of Travis's musical tastes today.  I have no idea how far down it went.  I also like how all of Travis's songs have to overcome some inner hardship.  Which one was that?  What was that?  My Chemical Romance?  Yeah, My Chemical Romance.  What was the hardship they had to overcome? 
[03:14:30]  Ask them.  I don't know.  Is that what you'd listen to when you were holding your cat with your long locks?  Doing the cat against the world?  Travis's songs have to overcome some inner hardship.  Like a fucking Lifetime movie.  I think he masturbates with one remote control in his hand and right as he's finishing, he  hits play and that song comes on.  Yeah!  Come on!  Which part is it?  Is it the part where he's recollecting when he was a young boy and his father took him 
[03:15:00]  to the city?  I think so.  Wow.  All right.  I like the brutality.  Well, this next clip, the boys say that all of Travis's music is queer.  We're running out of time here on the Opie and Anthony Staff Musical Adventure Hour.  And that's what you decided to play?  Yeah.  Knowing we had precious little time.  I've never seen it.  What song was it?  It helps that we know what song you're coming out of.  Before that, I think it was World Inferno Friendship Society.  Fucking Sam. 
[03:15:30]  World Inferno Friendship Society.  Yeah.  Listen to what a fucking prick he is.  Oh, play that?  We're running out of time here on the Opie and Anthony Staff Musical Adventure Hour.  And that's what you decided to play?  Yeah.  Knowing we had precious little time.  I've never seen Danny so disgusted.  I really am.  He was pretty angry.  This is...  He was more comfortable watching, like, Bill sniff a homeless person's asshole.  Danny may never talk to you ever again.  Then I've done my job here.  I may never talk to you again.  That's sad, then.  So what's next, Travis? 
[03:16:00]  Breakfast at Tiffany's?  No.  Oh, I love that song.  I know you do.  My Deep Blue Something.  Why didn't you play that song?  It's a good song.  How about Dishwalla?  Yeah.  You had that, too.  That's my favorite.  When are we going to hear a nice classic tune from The Verve Pipe?  You won't.  What?  Who are you looking at my playlist, Danny?  Spoiler alert.  Oh, my God.  These guys.  Don't you realize, Danny, especially, the more you fucking bash him like that, when it's  your turn, your songs are just going to suck. 
[03:16:30]  You just got confidence in these songs.  No, that's not necessarily true, because we actually recorded my hour already, and I  actually played manly music that no one can make fun of.  Oh, okay.  Danny went pretty safe.  He went pretty untouchable.  Did he?  Yeah.  Didn't take many chances.  Sometimes.  I played what I like.  I mean, chances are not.  I mean, I played what I like.  Straight forward rockin'.  Yeah.  I mean, there was some stuff that they could have gave me some shit about.  It's real hard to, you know.  Give me a sample.  One song.  Stunt Humble Pilots.  It's real hard to, you know.  SDP, really?  Say, you're gay. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, yeah, okay.  Oh, it's not hard.  Yeah, thank you.  Finally.  However, Sam's hour is an abomination.  Of course it is.  My hour is the best hour yet.  All stopped by, like, Lenny Kravitz.  Fuck it up.  Two more weeks for my hour.  Two more weeks for my hour.  Approximately how long is this song?  The song is 346.  Okay, so the world will become straighter in four minutes.  Not for Travis.  He's going to plug his iPod headphones and listen to this whole soundtrack again on his way home.  I sure am. 
[03:17:30]  Courtney Love.  He didn't even have to prep for this show.  It was just a playlist.  No, yeah.  He just plugged his iPod into the computer and put it on shuffle.  He had to put it on tough music.  That was his playlist.  Guy music.  Stop.  What's your last song, Travis?  It's my favorite artist ever.  Who is it?  Courtney Love.  It's a woman.  She's hot.  It's a woman?  It's a woman?  Oh.  So she can't be an artist?  She can't be your favorite artist ever.  No.  So you mean there's no time for that Tori Amos song you want to play? 
[03:18:00]  Oh, nailed.  Is she your favorite artist ever?  Uh, yeah.  I...  Oh, you are a faggot.  Are you kidding?  What song do you love?  I enjoy a whole song every once in a while.  I celebrate her entire catalog.  I really do.  What?  Doll parts?  You like that one?  What song did you play on the show?  Uh, hold on to me.  This life is never fair. 
[03:18:30]  In fact, you'll need a never there.  Music to spit in your hands to.  As he comes to me.  In the dead of winter, dead of night, he's all that I can see.  Hold on to me.  Oh.  Hold on to me.  Hey, yeah.  Hold on to me.  I love you, Johnny Cage. 
[03:19:00]  He's a fag.  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  What's up, dude?  I wish I knew how to quit you.  But there's no truth in the heart of any of it.  Oh, hello.  Can the passion and the bitterness remain?  Oh, oh, fuck it, fuck it. 
[03:19:30]  You're a filthy whore.  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  I love you.  Sid, I can smell you a cunt.  Oh, you like that, don't you faggot?  Gotcha, the malinga. 
[03:20:00]  And this is what they had to say about that song.  For that Tori Amos song you wanted to play.  I don't like Tori Amos.  I love women who sing in rock bands.  Haven't all these bands been headed by women so far?  No.  No?  All men.  These are all men?  Even that snake's out of Plains song.  Well, there was a girl in that.  We could probably squeeze in some Ani DeFranco.  If I play your cards right.  Ani DeFranco.  I want to take a stand.  I really respect your musical taste, so I'm going to...  Thanks.  Give her a shot.  Yeah.  So what song by?  Is this Hole, or is this Corny Love?  No, this is Corny Love. 
[03:20:30]  This is Hold On To Me.  Ugh.  God damn it.  Have you heard it?  No.  I haven't, and I won't, because I'm leaving before you play this song.  Do you picture she singing to you, Travis?  Yeah.  She's sexy.  No, she's not.  She's falling apart at the seams.  I saw her on awfulplasticsurgery.com.  Isn't that a great website?  Yeah.  It's also known as cornylove.com.  That was a big out, Travis.  Travis wants to be held.  He does.  He just wants to be held.  With his sweet music. 
[03:21:00]  And nurtured.  Hold on to me.  Unfortunately, your masculinity didn't sing that to you.  Not that that's a bad tune.  I mean, I would put that in my iPod.  Oh, it's so melody.  I know, my favorite artist ever.  She drove Cobain to blow his head off that unsupportive content.  You love her.  It is a faggoty song, though.  Oh, it's so slow and girly.  It's a girly song.  Unfortunately, Dillette doesn't have the largest catalog of some artists.  Oh, so.  Blame it on Dillette.  I will.  All right. 
[03:21:30]  There's only 18 billion songs in there.  Yeah, yeah.  What if they had 19 billion?  Oh, then it would have been all man.  Right.  It'll be less gay next time.  All right.  Now, why was Sam's so bad?  It was not bad.  It'll be two weeks from last Saturday.  So, just a week and a half until the best hour.  Like Danny gave an example of a song, an STP he played.  Can we just have maybe one example of...  Can I pick it?  No, what you did on your show already. 
[03:22:00]  What's one of the songs?  Can you do your show already?  You're going to say Rob Zombie.  Yeah, there's a couple Rob Zombie songs in there.  All right, you're all fucking man.  Yeah.  All right, you know what?  I have to say, I probably would like Sam's the best.  Yeah.  I like Zombie.  Especially because he played four Rob Zombie songs in an hour.  Oh.  Oh, Jesus.  Fine.  That's fine.  You know something?  I'd rather hear that than any of fucking Travis's picks.  Absolutely.  But there should be some rules.  Well, it was like one song per band.  I agree.  So, you really have to really show people what you listen to.  What did you play?  Living Dead Girl?  Well, there's two white zombie songs and two Rob Zombie songs. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, because they're so different.  Thunder Kiss 65.  All that was was more money for me.  House of a Thousand Corpses.  Foxy Foxy.  He didn't go with the hits.  Not Foxy Foxy.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Cool.  And I'm Your Boogeyman.  Was that believable?  How does Foxy Foxy go?  That's the first single off his current album, Educated Horses.  See, he didn't go with the hits.  Do we have this?  Do we have that song?  I'm sure we do.  All right, listen.  We're going to take a break. 
[03:23:00]  But it starts off real hardcore with that, you know.  Rob Zombie has fucking got some good stuff.  Oh, yeah.  No problem here.  I want to see this little, I want to see this Macintosh Apple Shoots boy rocking to it.  Try it.  The security at the concert keeps trying to find his parents.  Oh, it doesn't sound anything like zombie.  More human than human.  More human than human.  This is Living Dead Girl and Dragula. 
[03:23:30]  It's not.  Sorry.  Yelled at me.  Sounds like Lovin' Rockets a little bit.  Oh, he's swimwalked to it.  Jimmy's swimwalking to it.  That's right.  That's not bad.  It beats the fuck out of that goddamn girly shit. 
[03:24:00]  All right, that's a little mellower than I like his music.  So when's the next, what's it called, Music Adventure Hour?  Razzle Dazzle.  The Musical Adventure Hour.  When is the next one?  This Saturday, what time?  Saturday.  Eight o'clock?  Eight o'clock.  Eight o'clock?  You guys would give yourselves prime time.  Why wouldn't they?  Who the fuck is running this place?  Who's supposed to be in prime time?  Voss?  Razzle Dazzle's always on at eight o'clock.  Voss is leading.  All right.  Voss is leading.  Prime time for the boys when we're not here. 
[03:24:30]  God bless you.  I'd do the same thing.  What the hell?  Why not?  Wait, Voss' show wasn't on yet?  No.  Well, yeah.  It was the lead in for Voss' show.  This Travis one aired already at eight o'clock.  I guess if there's a show on the channel that no one actually heard, maybe technically it  wasn't on yet.  It wasn't on, yeah.  No one heard Voss' show?  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony show.  Most of us get here on time.  We're just fat guys on the air.  We are so pathetic.  We're fancy, fancy people. 
[03:25:00]  It's the battle of the mental illness.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  It's showtime, folks.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  You'll love us.  All right.  I thought I had a cool story, but it's... 
[03:25:30]  I thought there was more to it, but I guess not.  You know, the Hold Your Wee for Wee contest?  The KDND water drinking contest tragedy brings out more stories, including stuff from as far  back as 1970 when an LA station's contest to find a car driven by a jock led to a fatal  car accident.  Oh, boy.  I guess it was one of these bits where they threw a jock in a really nice car.  I guess maybe if I play this out of my mind, you know, maybe he's driving a brand new car  and the first listener to find him wins the car. 
[03:26:00]  And someone was trying to find the car and got into a fatal car accident because I guess  they're taking crazy chances to catch up to the guy or find the guy.  And then 1979, when a river rafting promotion at W.A.K.Y.  Louisville led to a drowning death.  I've never heard of that one.  Okay.  And as recently as last August, when, says the Victor Valley Daily Press, KZXY, ran a  water drinking contest in which the winner of a new pool table downed about a gallon and 
[03:26:30]  a half of water.  He wound up missing two weeks of work and is now trying to get a copy of the waiver he  signed.  Oh, happened before, did it?  Newspaper folks and other journalists are asking Inside Radio if the continuing publicity  out of KD&D Sacramento has changed the way stations are planning their promotions.  Short answer, short answer, you betcha.  You betcha.  You're not going to hear shit on the radio as far as, you know, contests like that go.  No more contests. 
[03:27:00]  I'll be in Sacramento this weekend, Friday through Sunday.  I'm actually doing the extra night there.  And, uh, I might have to do radio out there, so I'm really hoping I can get a fucking, a  good teasing of this incident while it's still fresh on everybody's sacramental mind.  Oh, God.  It's still an uncovered nerve.  Yeah, get some headlines, will you?  I, I, it depends.  I don't know what radio is out there, but, all right.  I'll have to make fun of it.  Uh, one of the stories we didn't get to, uh, yet, and it's a sexy one.  Ooh.  And also, now, a frightening story, this one out of Arizona. 
[03:27:30]  Police say a 29-year-old sex offender passed himself off as a 12-year-old to try and enroll  in a school.  Police say Neil Havens Roderick conned two older men he was living with into believing  that he was just a young boy.  One of the men posed as his grandfather and tried to enroll him in a charter school.  Police say it may have been a ploy to lure real children into sexual abuse.  The school didn't buy it, though, and police say the two older men were upset.  When they found out that Roderick was 29 and not a young boy, all three facing charges. 
[03:28:00]  How did they catch him?  Wow.  Did he get himself away?  I don't know.  Did someone mention something in 83 and he went, I remember that?  Yeah.  What?  How the fuck?  That's pretty twisted.  You're, you're, in all, in all reality, 30 years old.  And, uh, trying to pose as a 12-year-old. 
[03:28:30]  I don't know.  There should be pictures all over.  Like, with a story like that, fucking pictures.  I want to see the picture of the guy.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Big beard, mustache.  Yeah.  I mean, if you shave Travis's beard.  15?  Yeah.  Right?  Give him a cat.  Give him a cat.  And some dye.  This guy probably looks like Coppola.  Right?  Diana, California, what's up?  Um, are you going to play The My Baby Is Black?  I've been waiting since last, since the break. 
[03:29:00]  When you said, when you gave it a teaser.  Who hasn't?  I know.  I didn't tease it at all today.  I told the listeners.  Yes, you did.  I didn't tease No Baby, My Baby Is Black today.  Yes, you did.  You said, well, anyway.  Anthony, did I tease My Baby Is Black today?  No, that's just it.  You should have just played it.  I, uh, I told everybody that they got to remind us to play it.  Well, that boy did.  He called in, and he did remind you, and then you never played it.  See, that's one of those bits we want to play from, um, 6 to 9 a.m. Eastern time, because 
[03:29:30]  we have more people listening.  It's easy as that.  Tomorrow, we promise.  If you call up and tell me, tomorrow's the day.  What do you mean tomorrow?  This sucks.  Oh, because it feels forgetful.  What?  Oh.  Why do you want to hear it so bad?  Are you living?  Because it's hilarious.  Are you living it?  No, it's hilarious.  It's insanely funny.  I want to hear it for the same reason you do.  Yeah.  Have you ever taken Black Cock? 
[03:30:00]  Do what?  Have you?  No, I haven't, actually, but thanks for asking.  Are you asking all of us?  He's taking magazines of it home.  Oh, God.  Oh, that's right, yeah.  Okay.  Black Inches, I forgot.  So, if I call tomorrow, you'll play it?  Have you ever taken Black Cock?  That's a yes.  You have, huh?  Yeah.  A little bit.  There's a story there.  Half of it.  Half of it.  What's the story?  The point is, that's not why I want you to play it, because it's fucking hilarious.  What's the story?  What do you mean, what's the story? 
[03:30:30]  We'll play it.  What's the story with the Black Cock?  A little too much Jägermeister?  We want to hear the Black Cock story.  Just give us a little.  No.  Give us a little bit.  My bit.  How did it get, how did you meet?  What do you mean, how did we meet?  Where was it?  Was it a bar or work?  Yeah.  Well, it could have been work.  I was young.  You were young?  Okay.  I love this show.  How old were you?  How old were you when you took the Black Cock?  I was young and stupid.  I was 16.  Why is it stupid to take Black Cock? 
[03:31:00]  And how old was he?  How old?  Well, he was older than me.  How old?  I'm talking about this.  Oh, I wasn't.  But how much older?  How old was he?  How much older?  This is so much better than playing the actual bit.  How much older was he?  He was like 23.  23.  So you were in the same grade.  You're a six.  We weren't in the same grade.  No, she was in class with his son.  Oh, God.  Now, how black was he?  What do you mean?  Like, was he...  How do you rate him?  Like, what is Obama? 
[03:31:30]  What does he feel?  Obama's not that black.  Nah, he's in the middle.  Oh, he's not?  He's just a notch blacker than Tiger Woods.  Uh, Forrest Whitaker, when he played the last king of Scotland, where they actually made  him even darker.  Ultra black.  Ultra black.  No, you know who ultra black is?  That's the guy from, um, from, uh, what's it called?  Uh, he plays...  He always plays a scary African dude.  It was...  Well...  In America.  There's a movie called In America.  And he plays the crazy, uh...  I forget his name.  I don't know.  What's she talking about? 
[03:32:00]  It's not my...  I don't know.  I'm not sure.  There's a play...  Did you ever see In America, where they moved from Ireland over to here?  I don't know.  It's about these two little girls.  And he was just a crazy black guy in his apartment.  So, okay.  Now...  But he's dark.  But the point is...  Okay, hold on a second.  I gotta ask you a question.  All right.  Now, Opie, since you got to ask me if I ever cook a black cock, then I get to ask you  why you hate women so much.  Whoa.  Wow.  Boy, do you don't...  You don't know the voices on this show. 
[03:32:30]  You do.  You listen to me.  I listen to you guys every single day.  What makes you say that?  What makes you say that to you?  What makes me say that?  Yeah.  Because Opie always talks about shwuggies.  But then whenever it comes to...  Wait, wait, wait.  What do I talk about?  Hold on a second.  Listen, listen, listen, listen.  Just listen to me.  You always talk about the black guys.  Hold on.  You choose them.  Wait, wait, Diana.  You call them...  What do you call them?  Diana, Diana, slow down.  I didn't understand what you said.  I always talk about what?  The shorties?  What?  The shwuggies or whatever the fuck you call them.  Oh, shwuggies.  Oh, shwuggies.  But then when it comes up in between a black guy and a white woman president, you choose 
[03:33:00]  the black guy.  And that's what that means?  You always seem to pick...  Wait, and that's why I hate women?  Are you kidding me?  So many other good reasons to hate them.  I don't get it.  Don't you think...  You don't think it would be better to have a woman than a black president?  Right now.  Neither.  And not because of the president.  What if you had a choice?  Black president or female president?  Seriously, you have to make a choice.  I can't choose.  The laws are changed. 
[03:33:30]  Everyone has to vote.  You are forced.  They look at you.  You got to pull a lever.  Do you pull a lever for a black guy or do you pull a lever for a female?  This has nothing to do with my own beliefs.  This has to do with the country.  The country can't run...  It won't be able to run right with a woman or a black person as the head of the country  because this country is not ready for that.  There'd be turmoil.  But you have to pick.  I can't pick.  Why?  I can't. 
[03:34:00]  Whoever has the white vice president so that when we all know what would happen happens,  we'd have a white guy as president.  Make believe you're not Italian for once.  For one moment.  You have to pick.  Jimmy, you have to pick.  Black.  In a second.  Thank you.  Black.  You really want to...  No.  Yes.  You want a female in there that's on the reg every month?  Do you understand how many programs...  You're not scared of being out of the black people?  Right.  Do you know how many programs... 
[03:34:30]  They always talk about the man and fight the...  Like now.  Right.  They'd be like...  Do you imagine if they had a black guy in charge?  They'd be like, we got our guy in.  Ooh, this would be like...  They'd be dancing around that they got their guy in as the head guy.  And white America would resent that so much, there would be a fucking race war.  It's just...  They would totally, all the stuff they say about slavery and all that stuff, they would  totally fucking...  They don't know how to react to that.  Even though I don't think Obama's like that, I think he's very intelligent and he probably 
[03:35:00]  could be a very good president.  The reaction of the people who would vote for him is what it would be.  So you would go for a female president?  You have to make a choice.  Hold on, man.  Hold on.  You have to make a choice.  This is a really interesting question.  And by the way, why are we talking about your black cock anymore?  I know.  You're trickery.  You're using trickery.  My baby is black.  It's trickery.  I know she wanted to...  We're very smart.  What the fuck did your father do that at 16?  We could have a woman president because pussy rules the world. 
[03:35:30]  So if we had a woman president, not Hillary Clinton, but if we had a woman president, then  she would convince all the other guys from the other countries.  Everybody would be nice to us.  If women ruled the world, why a missile shaped like dicks?  You ever see a flying vagina?  They're aerodynamically unsound.  You can't launch a vagina shaped bomb.  Everything in this world has looked like a cock.  Wonderful dick.  That rules the world.  That's what all men think about is sex. 
[03:36:00]  That's why.  Diana.  What?  So, 16, black cock.  Are you...  I have a baby.  I have a little...  I have a baby.  But that's not what I'm hearing.  Is it...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I heard it the other day and my...  I want my boyfriend to eat.  Did it...  Is it...  It's hilarious.  Is it a mulatta baby?  Who?  My baby...  Yeah, she's a mulatta mongrel.  Is she?  Out of which will come a conglomerated...  You know what?  You...  Mulatta...  ...mongrel class of people.  All braces will be destroyed in such a movement.  Diana.  She's prettier than all the white kids. 
[03:36:30]  Oh, we know.  We never deny that you guys make, you know, supermodel kids.  Supermodel factory blacks and whites.  But let me ask you something.  How big's your ass?  My ass?  Yeah.  Normal size?  I don't know.  Now, be honest.  It's a little on the big side, right?  No, it's not.  I'm not a fat white girl.  I didn't say you're fat.  I just say you got a little booty on you.  What size jeans do you wear?  Not really, though.  Normal size.  Fat size.  What size jeans do I wear?  I wear, like, four.  All right, well.  Unless she's lying.  She's going four.  I swear to God. 
[03:37:00]  Do you want to talk to my boyfriend?  He's here.  He'll tell you.  Oh, he is?  Yes, put him on.  Let's talk to him.  Well, hello there.  I want to know what...  Put him on.  I am.  And...  Just put him on the phone.  What?  Hey, how you doing, man?  What's your name?  Chris.  Chris.  What's your bugging your bug about?  We're just asking your wife.  Is she your wife?  No, girlfriend.  Girlfriend?  Basically, yeah.  Girlfriend.  We're just asking because she's white and you're black, right?  I'm white.  Oh, what happened? 
[03:37:30]  How dare you?  But the baby...  The baby...  Does the baby look white or look mixed?  I learned...  The baby is predominantly black.  Really?  I learned my lessons.  What are you, just fucking rubbing it against the sides?  Just the sides, yeah.  So wait, when you guys go out, like the two of you go out with the baby...  She must suck a mean cock.  Because he's sitting there like...  Oh, of course.  Why am I here?  Why do we have to go to the park with this?  Are you ever embarrassed?  Dude, are you ever embarrassed?  Not embarrassed.  I'm just amazed at the attention it gets. 
[03:38:00]  They think you guys are the nanny?  The nanny or yeah, they just...  Oh my God.  Dude, what the fuck?  Like, how do you deal with that?  It's uncomfortable.  It is.  I mean, it's...  Does the father ever come around?  I've never seen the guy, no?  No?  I don't get...  A black father.  Oh, man.  What...  Yeah.  So what was it like when you first, like, saw the kid?  Did she tell you she was with a black guy first and had a kid? 
[03:38:30]  Or did you see the kid and kind of figure it out?  I just think it was dirty.  No, I think I knew.  I knew.  Try to scrub it with Brillo.  What was that?  Yeah, she told you?  She's pretty open about it.  She's not ashamed about it.  So I knew right from the get-go almost.  Well, as a white guy, it's a little rough.  Do you think about it and go like...  What do your friends say?  I don't think about it.  What do your friends say?  I don't think about it because she's around so many white people,  too.  It's not like...  What do your friends...  You know, it's still separated.  It's pretty...  She's well-rounded with white and black.  What do your friends say when she's not around? 
[03:39:00]  When she's not around?  Yeah, they goof on you a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  What do they say?  Give us one.  Split in the dark oak.  Split in the dark oak.  What's the kid's name?  Kid's name?  Rasmus.  Alexis.  Oh, my God.  He doesn't know.  You didn't know what the kid's name...  What, did you just get there last night?  Yeah, last night.  No.  She doesn't live with us.  That's why. 
[03:39:30]  Oh, okay.  All right.  Let's get back on the phone.  Yeah, I'm boring you.  Yeah, well...  You're all right.  We should have...  Hey, Anthony, you should have bought the Roush package to begin with from Mustang.  No.  A full stage three thing.  Nah, I want to...  I was just an option.  Just an opinion.  Hey, I wanted the...  I'm sure it's fast enough.  Don't worry about it.  You tell me then.  All right.  Hello?  You didn't even ask him what you were supposed to ask him.  No, that you were hot.  We asked him what we wanted to.  About the size of my ass.  They think I'm lying that I said I'm a size four. 
[03:40:00]  I'm not one of the big, fat white girls that date all black guys.  I'm not one of those girls.  Black guys kind of like the big butt.  All right.  Listen, Diana, we're not going to get much out of you.  Tomorrow's the day we play My Baby is Black.  Yeah.  For you.  So are you going to play it for me?  Dedicated to you.  Yeah, for you.  For you tomorrow.  Thank you so much.  Bye, guys.  I love you guys.  Bye.  And I don't hate women.  Bye.  All right.  That was me.  It's Jimmy.  Something to do with something that happened to him as a child. 
[03:40:30]  We should have asked her how her father killed himself.  What method he used.  All right.  Time for line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Here's the first runner-up line of the day.  Who the fuck wrote last nerve?  What factor all wrote that?  He's on my last nerve.  Good.  I hope so.  Why does he feel the fucking need?  Oh.  Oop.  I just did what this guy's writing about.  Oops.  The interruption. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  All right.  That didn't get cut quite right.  Yeah.  It was cut horribly.  Who cut that?  Fat Rock.  Fat Rock.  He's getting fired soon anyway.  Bodogfight.com.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  I know I said cash registers instead of cashiers.  They want to start a union.  You have to say cash registers.  I know.  Cash registers.  People have to wash their hands before they touch our buttons.  Holding picket signs in their little drawer mouths.  We want. 
[03:41:30]  We need better pay.  They're little drawer mouths.  Yeah, they got little drawer mouths.  They open up and close.  Thanks to Bodogfight.com.  Check out the website to find out what it's all about.  Bodogfight.com.  Here is today's line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day. 
[03:42:00]  Yes, they're just showing you that fat stomach and an appendix scar and a rotten brown uncut dick  and a fucking dirty, a dirty fucking plane steering hand jerking it.  Fucking awful.  Fucking pilot school hand.  There you are.  Line of the day.  Wool, Jimmy Norton.  All the lines today were kind of like phrase moments. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah.  As opposed to just lines.  I'm not knocking it.  I'm saying that happens sometimes.  They were just like little, little, little montages.  Montages.  His fucking...  Hawk's mouth does that.  Montages.  I want to close his mouth with an upswing of a sledgehammer.  Oh, that'd be great.  We got to go early today because we got to talk to lawyers about how we could talk dirtier.  On the radio.  Yeah.  We got to talk to the lawyer there.  Talk to them about the topless shit that we can't do.  Please.  It's right there.  Yeah, I know.  I saw some.  Please, please.  All right. 
[03:43:00]  We'll talk about the topless.  We need the art of the topless back on our radio.  The of the topless bucksonic babes.  I know.  Back on the show.  I know Hillary doesn't have a period anymore.  I know that much.  No.  The attitude's still there, though.  Let's be honest.  She has it, but it's out of her mouth.  Let's go.  The National Board of Health and Luckyfella brand suppositories bring you your body and  you.  Hosted by famed sexual behavior expert, Professor Jim Norton. 
[03:43:30]  I'm a perv and I'm weird, but I'm straightforward.  Professor Norton outlines his very hands-on approach to sexual education.  Wait till your kids are asleep and just lay over one of them.  They won't know.  Oh, Jesus.  What?  For example, the art of foreplay.  The first thing I do is go to the bathroom and take one of those eight decibel shits.  Oral sex.  Why?  Sexual experimentation.  I was performing tushalinga.  And sexually transmitted diseases.  I wish I had AIDS so I could bite somebody.  And for the grown-ups, there's also a segment on marriage counseling.  Honey, you're 41. 
[03:44:00]  Can I finally have the balloon nut?  He'll also stress the importance of lubrication.  You want it to sound like when your muddy boot gets stuck like a quagmire?  Another word to the wise from Professor Jim Norton.  Remember, I'm the same.  Line of the Day is brought to you by Bodog.
