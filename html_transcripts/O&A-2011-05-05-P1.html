<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about the unreleased photos of Osama bin Laden's death. Opie, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton debated the government's reasoning for withholding the images, with Cumia expressing anger and a desire for closure, while Norton voiced skepticism and a desire for verification.  The conversation veered into tangents covering Norton's travel disruptions due to President Obama's visit to New York City,  their bizarre daydreams (including violent fantasies), Norton's Kentucky Derby betting plans, Cumia's hatred of New York State politics, and a discussion of 9/11 conspiracy theories, particularly regarding missing Pentagon footage.  A listener's tweet suggesting the photos didn't exist was also discussed.  No guests were present during this segment.

The show then shifted to a caller claiming to be an active-duty military doctor who had seen a photo of bin Laden's corpse, describing a bullet wound, a white substance in his eye socket, and a cleaned-up face. This claim was disputed by a subsequent caller, a Marine Corps colonel, who stated such a photo would be highly classified. The discussion continued on the public's right to see the photo and the controversy surrounding its existence.  This segment also featured "Dan in Jersey," who claimed to possess a picture but had protected tweets, frustrating the hosts. A discussion followed regarding a graphic photo of a lovesick teenager who jumped from a building and hit a bus, prompting comparisons to 9/11 imagery. The segment concluded with a caller named "Bobo," performing a one-man band act on a bus using a kazoo and an air horn.

The next segment featured a lengthy and rambling discussion with Rich Voss about a dispute with Rascals comedy club and a Thanksgiving show.  The conversation included numerous tangents, including graphic descriptions of Voss's dry, cracked hands (backed up by a Twitter photo), explicit details of his sex life with his wife Bonnie, further debate about the veracity of bin Laden's death, and a discussion of Voss's use of Klonopin for anxiety, along with a plane-related anecdote. Jimmy (last name unknown) was in the studio and participated.  A woman from the Helium Comedy Club unexpectedly arrived, and a brief mention was made of Mario Lopez's potential appearance. The segment also included a discussion of a man who was beaten, tattooed, and tased in his genitals.

The Klonopin discussion continued with a caller, Avi, asserting its addictive nature, prompting Voss to defend his usage.  Another caller, Jeff, offered a contrasting perspective.  Dr. Steve, a guest, weighed in on Klonopin's addictive potential, emphasizing the role of withdrawal symptoms.  The conversation broadened to encompass addiction, recovery, and pain management, with Ronnie B.'s decision to forgo painkillers after surgery being used as an example.  The hosts expressed concern about Voss's relapse risk, leading to insults and accusations. Another caller, also identified as Dr. Steve, jokingly suggested his own wine.  The segment also included discussions of Voss's anxiety, past use of Paxil, and the potential side effects of various anxiety medications.  The Wayans Brothers, present outside the studio, briefly joined the broadcast, along with Stetson, the man who had been beaten, tased, and tattooed. The hosts teased Voss for prioritizing the Wayans Brothers over Stetson's interview.  The show concluded with plugs for upcoming shows, casual conversations including anecdotes about sexual encounters, political commentary, and more banter and jokes at Voss's expense.  The show ended with an apparent breakdown of its usual structure.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on live now? Is it happening? This is it?  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for the cringe style of entertainment  and having very few limits. 
[00:00:30]  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is, like, different than any other radio.  Don't tell them what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's just not like radio. It's just like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  And saying.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people. Real excitement. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  And do it again.  Now do it again.  Time to do it again.  That should be our promo.  Opie and Anthony.  Do it again.  Doing it again.  And again.  And again.  And again.  You like yesterday's show?  Fuck you.  Pay me. 
[00:01:30]  Fuck you.  Do it again.  I liked yesterday's show.  Yeah.  It was fun.  I loved Jesse James.  I thought he was great.  A lot of people.  Kudos.  Yes.  A lot of kudos.  For the Jesse James segment.  What a gift though.  We thought I was going to be gone today.  And the flight was able to be switched.  And I'm not shooting until tomorrow.  So what a gift that I'm.  That is a gift.  Everybody just gets a gift today.  A gift of Jim. 
[00:02:00]  You wrote that yesterday.  Oh did I?  I replied to all.  And I just wrote boo.  Because you were all.  Oh I emailed it.  You emailed that.  Lucky.  What do you call us all?  Lucky ducks.  Devils?  It was lucky ducks.  Oh this time it was lucky ducks.  Oh everyone's a lucky duck this morning.  Basically he was telling the entire company that everyone is lucky.  Lucky ducks that Jim's going to be here today.  Yes.  And not flying out today.  A big switch.  I fly out a little later.  So I just wanted to let the audience know.  So I wrote back boo.  You hitch a ride on Air Force One? 
[00:02:30]  No?  No.  No.  No.  Air Force One?  Oh look this is nice.  You fly out of Newark right?  I do yeah.  Today I'm flying out of Newark.  Oh okay.  The president coming into JFK.  Kennedy.  Oh is he?  Yeah.  JFK.  10.30 and then he's going to.  We're so close to the situation.  It feels good to be part of the situation.  You pull up to the building and the barricades are all set up.  So the president will pretty much be using the same roads we use. 
[00:03:00]  He's yeah they got everything barricaded off because he's going to it's going to a firehouse.  Right.  And then in Midtown and then it's a precinct or some shit.  Yeah.  And then he's going to go to grand zero.  But in the meantime he's just completely fucking up traffic.  I have to I have to run out of this place at literally 10 o'clock.  I'm surprised you're not leaving already.  I might have to leave a little early.  You might have to leave like now.  Eight.  In protest.  In protest.  Well certainly in protest. 
[00:03:30]  I'm surprised you're even on the same soil as Obama today.  But they got.  Are you going to be okay with that?  Yeah I think I'm okay with that as long as I'm getting out before he's really getting in.  He lands at 1030.  I hope to be off of the Isle of Manhattan by then.  But they have the barricade set up where if they shut that road down I can't get my fucking truck out of the garage.  They shut the road down real early.  I know.  Real early.  Especially after Bin Laden being killed.  I hate that shit.  You might be stuck my friend. 
[00:04:00]  Kenny's got to keep.  You might have to leave.  I would leave in a half hour.  Kenny's got.  Yeah I'm thinking that too.  Like why don't you just throw all that greatness out in a half hour and get the fuck out of here.  I really should.  You should just squeeze it out right now.  Take it all.  Whatever you have inside you.  Blow the load as they say.  And I'm out.  I just got your email.  I just saw it.  Oh the boat.  But I read Kenny sent one too.  Mine was.  You know I'm trying to have fun.  You lucky ducks.  I'll be in. 
[00:04:30]  Kenny was able to.  Here's what Kenny's response was.  Yeah.  I had notified Opie, Anthony, Travis, and Gary also earlier.  Notified.  Where's the fun in that?  You should never write notified.  Yeah.  Where is the fun in that?  There's no fun in that.  I don't think I've ever written notified.  No one writes notified.  Kenny why notified?  Even if Fide wants something that I don't want to give him.  Why so professional all the time Kenny?  Isn't that what you're paying for?  Professionalism? 
[00:05:00]  Ah.  Brings up a point.  You can't crack this guy.  The professionalism.  Good point.  Good point.  And I suggest we end the show on time so we escape out of here before POTUS gets here  and locks us down.  Now, I think one of your jobs, Kenny, might be to keep tabs on the president's arrival  and see if our garage is going to be shut down.  Right.  As far as we're concerned, I'm on that. 
[00:05:30]  And here's another problem.  I don't know if you're going to be able to pull the truck up in front and stop there.  They might make you leave.  Yeah, because he's going to ground zero.  Yeah, but he's going, first he's going to a firehouse.  Where?  Midtown.  Close to here.  Real close.  Yeah, and then he's got to go up.  On 8th Avenue?  The one on 9th, I think.  I don't know where there is one on 9th.  There's one on 8th in the 40s.  Yeah, that's the one then.  Oh, yeah, right.  I thought that was on the corner of 9th Avenue.  Look at me correcting you, and I'm completely wrong. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, he used to, oh, I didn't know he was going there.  I imagine they'll block all walking traffic, too.  You think?  Well, right by it, sure.  Oh, yeah, they don't want people strutting around.  You want to be a looky-loos today, Jimmy, like we were last time?  No, I have to go home and finish.  Me and Jimmy, how long did we hang out on that dump corner?  An hour.  An hour.  Outside the view, and we barely saw him.  And then I snuck around after you left, and I was the front of the line as the motorcade went flying by.  Will you touch his arm and just go, Barry, to get a picture? 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, I don't think you'd get to touch Barry's arm.  I don't think so.  Secret Service just pummels you.  But I want to, you know how we have these dumb day fantasies?  I have the same ones that you have.  Oh, yeah.  And I'm doing this, you know, I'm doing the DC antisocial.  What do you mean the same as we have?  Day fantasies, like with these little things that your mind kind of wanders and you think these things.  And we should never say them, but we do.  We do.  For the entertainment value.  Because it's radio.  I'm getting killed about the celebrity thing, by the way.  What's that?  Where I'm convinced these big celebrities know me because I know them. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, yeah.  That is crazy.  And this started way before I got any type of fame in my dumb life.  That's literally crazy.  We're doing something.  No, I didn't have to tell people.  You got crazy thoughts.  Of course I do.  But you're keeping them in.  No, I've told a few.  Not all of them, though.  Not all of them, no.  Yeah, none of us tell all of them.  I got some fun ones, though.  Do you?  Yeah, yeah.  Do you got one you would be willing to share?  Action-packed ones.  Oh, no, you've talked about those.  Yeah, yeah.  I've talked about the action-packed ones.  That goes way back with you.  Yeah, yeah.  Where you have these crazy scenarios as you're just doing a mundane task at an old job or 
[00:07:30]  something.  Well, that or I would...  Right now...  Jimmy, we'll go back to you.  I'm sorry.  Right now, I think it'd be cool.  This would be cool, right?  Walking, trying to get to the hotel or something, time-square in my truck.  All of a sudden, a van pulls up.  Oh, my God.  There's an Al-Qaeda guy with a fucking bomb pack on him.  And I just draw on him, blow his head right off, and he drops to the ground, not even  getting a chance to blow himself up.  I'm a big hero.  And you just see that as you're walking? 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Oh, that's nice.  It was quick.  It was just like a quick kind of, yeah, that'd be cool.  Then you realize it's not a bomb pack.  He's just carrying a flat-screen TV.  You've murdered a delivery man.  That would suck.  But I thought, yeah, sure.  I got to slap Kevin from Connecticut today.  No, I don't think the people on TV could see me, too, asshole.  Oh.  You wave to him?  Yeah.  Hey, hey.  Hey, look at me.  Back to Jimmy.  Sorry.  The daydream.  It was only, we're doing this thing for antisocial. 
[00:08:30]  We wanted to visit some wounded soldiers or something.  Or a teller I wanted to, and I was going to go with them.  And I'm sure Jim and Bill would, and then I found out that that day they're doing something  at the Pentagon, which we're going to go to.  It's a good thing, a lunch for soldiers who are hurt or something.  You're going to the Pentagon?  I think so, yeah.  Fuck.  But I started having this day fantasy, like, what if the president's there?  Because, you know, it's D.C., and we all take a picture with him.  You have to say yes. 
[00:09:00]  Because he has to take a picture with the antisocial crew.  Oh, that would kind of bug me.  The antisocial crew.  But I thought to myself, like, we're all staying there for the picture, and Dave would  go, ah, come on, well, your name's on the tour.  You stand closest to him, and I would stand closest to him.  You don't even have a shot in hell.  I know.  That's a great one.  I'm 42.  But that's, but I like how Jimmy's fantasy is just getting a picture with somebody.  That's all I want.  That's all he wants.  Yeah.  We all understand that.  That's his thing.  But it's so funny. 
[00:09:30]  It's just like, yeah, yeah, and we get to take a picture.  Do you know how many presidential photos I've fantasized about to trump that Clinton?  Hey, look at this little mop-topped kid.  It bothers you I got a Clinton picture, doesn't it?  It has to bother you.  No.  My photo way better than any photo you've ever gotten.  It probably is, yeah.  No.  But you're still trying.  I'm happy for you.  I look forward to the day you come in here and trump me.  I will eventually.  Wait, can I get back to this?  Sure.  So where was everyone?  I didn't go through it literally.  You were right next to Obama because you're the anti-anti, sorry. 
[00:10:00]  That's fine.  Sorry, guys.  Anti-social guy.  Yeah.  And then who's the other guy that gets to stand next to Obama on the other side?  I didn't even.  I know you thought.  I know.  I really didn't.  I didn't know.  All I knew is they were getting cut out of my picture.  Yeah.  Right on the wall.  Yeah.  It's you and him.  And does he turn around at some point and he goes, I've seen your specials on HBO.  In some of the, in some of the funny, me and Michelle have watched a few and no,  because he would never enjoy my specials or admit to it.  He would enjoy me from the tonight show because it's clean.  He would never admit or like my specials. 
[00:10:30]  He might go, I've seen you on TV.  So your fantasies have to be pretty real.  Of course, of course they do.  Like as far as that goes, he can't, you, you'll get a picture with him in the Pentagon,  but he can't possibly like your, your specials.  No, or maybe from Lucky Louie or something that he would have, because he's a wire fan.  So he may have watched it.  Oh, that, something like that.  Right, right, right.  Those are the weird tie-ins, but there has to be a weird tie-in.  Yeah.  Ah, we all do it.  Sure.  Oh, that's great.  Like the Bushes, George Bush and his father were in Texas for the World Series. 
[00:11:00]  And I didn't cover the World Series for Lenoir.  I forget who did.  It might have been Ross who does a good job with those things.  But I was like, fuck, I wish I would have, because I would have just talked to them and  gotten a photo with, but all I thought of was how I would have, I didn't care about the  piece, fucking, I would have gotten a photo with those two.  Yeah.  But that's more believable.  That's, you have a shot there.  He didn't.  He was nowhere near them.  Oh, really?  No.  They didn't do it.  They don't do Tonight Show pieces.  No.  They don't do funny Q&As.  All I'm thinking of in Kentucky is this dinner, this celebrity dinner that we're going to be 
[00:11:30]  doing some broadcasting out of.  Kentucky Derby.  Yeah.  God, I don't want to fucking go to that damn thing one time.  And all I'm thinking of is, because I have a list of who's going to be there, I want  to get pictures with.  Who's going to be there?  All I care about is Terry Bradshaw, Tom Brady, and Aaron Rodgers.  A lot of celebrities.  That's three biggies.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's all I care about is those three.  What about the hats?  The hats?  Are you going to be wearing a hat?  Oh, that's a big thing.  I'm wearing one.  They made a hat for you?  They made me try on my outfits last time I was out there for clothes. 
[00:12:00]  How brutal is the hat?  It's not good.  See, the Kentucky Derby is known for the hats, Jimmy.  I can't wait to see Jimmy in one of those hats.  It's not good.  Like, the royal wedding reminded me of the Kentucky Derby, because they wear very silly  hats, especially the women.  Very floppy, silly.  They put little horse tracks around the brim of the hat and things like that.  They get crazy.  So, yeah, they go crazy.  I want to see the horse thing.  I've never been to a horse race.  You've never gone to the horse? 
[00:12:30]  Never.  Really?  No.  It's very exciting.  You've never gone to a local horse track?  No.  Belmont.  On the rail.  I'm going to bet.  Right by the fucking wire.  And you just...  It sounds like thunder when they fucking toss them.  It's exciting.  It's very exciting.  Something about it.  Very exciting.  Especially, you know, you've got a couple bucks on a pony.  I'm not even talking like a lot of money.  Just, you know...  A little action.  A couple and all a bet.  A little exacted bet.  Something like that.  And you're on the rail.  You're like, come on!  Come on!  And it just thunders past you, man. 
[00:13:00]  It's fucking cool.  I'm going to bet on the long shot.  Whoever the long shot is.  Really?  I don't care who it is.  How much, though?  I don't know.  I was thinking of the way in.  20 G's?  No.  They do end up with a few 20 to 1 shots and stuff like that.  Yeah.  Something like...  I won't like losing 500 bucks.  You've got to hope that a lot of horses break their legs.  Yeah.  Or I can make that happen.  Especially Kentucky Derby.  A long shot.  I'll tell you.  Throw your favorite out.  Take your second and third favorite.  Uh-huh.  And exact to box it.  I don't know what any of that means.  That's what I do.  I don't know what exact to box it means.  Does it work for you? 
[00:13:30]  Somebody just fucking Twittered me and said, like, dude, the fucking throwing the favorite  thing out worked for me.  It's like, well, it'll work occasionally.  So you're going to do it this time?  It's not a system.  Yeah, I always...  Well, how do we bet on horses these days?  I always do that.  I don't know.  Are there still, like, NASA county OTBs?  Most of the OTBs are done.  I know the city ones are done, but I'm not sure if all the NASA and Suffolk ones...  They basically took away our online gambling, so now we have to deal with the mafia again.  Thank you, America.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Because, yeah, we're going to stop betting.  So now we're going to get our legs broken and stuff. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.  The OTB thing kept it nice and safe, but you guys couldn't run that.  The state couldn't run OTB.  The state couldn't be a bookie.  They lost too much money on a bookie operation.  We downplay that shit, but that tells you everything you need to know.  Like, idiots.  They couldn't keep OTB profitable.  It tells you everything you need to know about the government and how they misappropriate funds and fuck up and triple, quadruple dip into it. 
[00:14:30]  Redundant payments.  Because a bookie makes money.  Yeah.  Even a bad bookie makes money.  So if you're the state and you're the bookie for all horse racing, all horse racing, how the fuck do you lose money?  They should have a story on that every day with just a lot of question marks on the screen.  Like, how the fuck does this happen?  How do you lose money?  But we've already moved on from that story.  But that means they're fucking up everywhere.  Our taxes?  With our money.  Yeah.  Of course they are. 
[00:15:00]  God.  I just paid my property taxes in the county that is the highest property taxed area in the country.  You don't pay enough.  Number one.  You don't pay enough, though.  No, I'm not doing my part.  You don't pay enough taxes.  I'm telling you right now.  The number one county in the country.  How many counties are in the United States of America?  That's more than seven.  Quite a few counties in the United States.  I just happen to live in the number one taxed county. 
[00:15:30]  And people are probably going, move them, move.  Well, you know what?  It's a fine line between convenience and paying and my job and shit like that.  If it wasn't for this gig, I swear to God, I'd be fucking Jesse James' next-door neighbor in Texas.  It just sounds like a pisser down there.  Yeah, but you're not going to move.  What?  You would probably move out to Suffolk County.  No.  You would actually move, move?  I would leave New York State.  No.  Yep.  Really?  I'm fucking sick of this cunt shit state that is New York fucking state. 
[00:16:00]  They are fucking robbed.  They rob you.  They're corrupt criminals that run this fucking shithole.  They're a mommy-nanny fucking state where everybody's, it's in everybody's best interest what the fucking dumb politicians are telling us what we need to do and don't need to do, can and can't do.  The graft and bullshit and spending and taxing and welfare that goes on in this cunt hole state that is New York can suck my fucking ball sack once I'm done with this job. 
[00:16:30]  When radio's done, where do you go?  I will go anywhere but New York.  Nah, nah, nah, you've thought about it.  I'll fucking move to Pennsylvania.  I don't give a shit.  I'll go to fucking, I'll go to a surrounding area so I'm close to family and shit.  Pennsylvania's not bad.  But I'm leaving fucking New York. 
[00:17:00]  I'm sick of their dumb laws.  I'm sick of their gun laws.  I'm sick of fucking everything.  Everything about it.  Tax the fuck out of me and give me worse in return than people that pay a tenth of the taxes I pay.  The lack of freedom to do anything.  The pain in the ass.  It just sucks.  I hate this fucking state.  I fucking hate it.  I've come into a city where the mayor is a piece of shit. 
[00:17:30]  Fuck him.  Fuck driving in this city.  Fuck cab drivers.  Fuck the melting pot.  Get me around white people.  I just want to live around white people.  Oh my god, what's going on with you?  I hate New York.  Melting pot my cock.  I don't know if I recognize you anymore.  By the way, that should be the name of your autobiography.  Melting pot my cock.  The Anthony Cumia story.  The picture of you in a tree fort. 
[00:18:00]  Your memory's being wiped out by a fucking...  Yes.  Things that could have been.  Are you mad because Obama's going down to ground zero?  Yeah, he's going to fuck up traffic and shit.  That's the only reason, though?  No, you know, he hasn't been there since he's been president.  He missed the anniversary.  Was he down there when he was campaigning, I think?  Yeah, he was there when he was campaigning.  It's just like, you know, whatever.  And it's kind of a grandstanding thing.  He says it's not, and his supporters say it isn't. 
[00:18:30]  But, I mean, come on, days after you take credit for killing bin Laden, you head down to ground zero.  All right, gee, thanks.  Thanks a lot.  Obviously, it was impossible, but if Bush was still president, he would be down there, right?  Sure.  Yeah, but, you know, again...  Or any president just seems like the place to be.  Again, I bring up the fact that, you know, as president, Bush was down there, you know?  He went down there.  He invited Bush, though.  Bush said no.  I mean, Bush is avoiding the limelight. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, yeah, he is.  Except he does a book tour.  He wants no part of it.  He was invited.  Good for him.  But now, inside source is saying that he feels slighted.  Really?  Bush, yep.  Why?  I don't know, because everyone's got to spin it.  Everyone is spinning this thing, no matter what side you're on.  He was called to invite it, I guess.  Yeah, but he feels kind of, like, slighted.  It's in the paper today.  You'll see it.  And I'm pissed because of the picture thing.  I'm very pissed at that.  It's like, come on.  Is he right?  I'm up in the air.  Like, I completely want to see it. 
[00:19:30]  I want to see it.  And then a part of me is like, but what is the right thing to do?  The right thing to do is show what our military did, what they're capable of, the results.  This has been something we've done over the years.  We've, you know, over the years, we showed pictures of Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Vietnam, for the good or bad of it.  We showed that.  It's just, why?  Like, what is the purpose?  I don't believe the purpose is that it's going to incite more violence. 
[00:20:00]  People fucking, they hate us.  The Islamic extremists hate us.  A picture of bin Laden being dead, and the fact that he is dead is probably enough to make him hate us more if that's going to happen.  But a picture used as a recruiting tool, but all they need is a recruiting tool is to show a hot fucking woman not wrapped up in a burka, not being beaten in the face by a hairy fucking man with an unclipped dick. 
[00:20:30]  And they hate us for that.  So fuck you.  They don't like pictures of our houses.  They don't like pictures of our shopping centers and the fact that we have cars and things.  They don't like any of that shit, and that we don't praise Allah.  That's their biggest problem, that we're infidels.  Not that we fucking blew the head off of the guy that killed thousands here.  Fuck them.  I don't like that Obama said, like, I want to see the photo. 
[00:21:00]  He goes, we don't spike the football.  And it's like, you don't use that type of a sportsmanship analogy.  This is not a friendly contest between people.  And I don't think the average person was thinking that releasing the photo is spiking the football.  I'm surprised he used that language.  There's a way of releasing the photo where it looks like you're not spiking the football.  It happened.  It's American history and world history, and it should be out there.  I agree, man.  This savage killed 3,000 New Yorkers. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And other military personnel.  And after we had helped him against the Soviets, fuck him, man.  It's not spiking.  He's acting like it's, hey, guys, you know, a combatant's met and one combatant.  This scumbag killed civilians on purpose.  I do think we have the right to see it.  Yeah, I'm disappointed in Obama using that language.  He just put that in everyone's head, spiking the football.  I just want to see the fucking death photo.  Saddam's sons were prominently displayed in death to prove that they were fucking gotten. 
[00:22:00]  Yep.  Al-Zarqawi was.  Al-Zarqawi.  They showed that.  What is it with bin Laden and what is it with this president that he won't fucking show it?  Because Bush did allow bodies to be shown after they were killed in combat.  Bush shows the photo, you think?  Why won't this fucking guy?  Bush would absolutely have shown the photo.  There's a reason they're not.  Like, the only thing I'm thinking is, what is the reason they're not?  Like, I know their thing is, like, I react very angrily. 
[00:22:30]  Like, I'm like, you know, fuck these people.  Fuck their loyalty to bin Laden.  Fuck their anger.  They hate us anyway.  Anyone who's going to suicide bomb Americans because of that photo doesn't like us right now.  Right.  But, if you're the president and your guard is to, your job is to protect people, do you  have to go, hey, yeah, that's a very cool response, you know, when you're 15 and there's  no consequences, but the reality is, there's been no backlash as of right now.  It's more Islamic ass-kissing.  I'm sorry.  That's how I see it.  It's more, let's not offend, let's not do that. 
[00:23:00]  That's why they fucking, whether they did or not, that's why they're making a point  of saying they gave them a decent Islamic burial within Islamic law and stuff.  It's like, that's why they got to say that shit, because we have to appease these Islamic  militant fucking crazy people, or what?  We're afraid they're going to attack us again?  But they did, don't forget, and this is what I have to remember, too, is like, even though  we are being polite, they're dummies, a lot of them. 
[00:23:30]  A lot of them are dirt poor morons.  Of course they are.  I mean, that Times reporter said that you could not talk logically to them, so it's  not like, again, you're appeasing people of an equal mentality.  They have idiots.  But he, I think he believes they are, and he believes we can get to them through kindness  and that, it doesn't work, it's proven over the years, it doesn't fucking work.  I don't like Islamic extremist ass-kissing, however, we did, or they did, the president did,  and the military, of course, for this operation did go into an Islamic 
[00:24:00]  radical country unannounced, shoot him in the head, shoot everybody he was with, and take  them out.  Like, they really did what they were supposed to do without kissing.  Absolutely.  They didn't kiss Pakistan's ass.  No, no.  They went into a sovereign nation and blew his brains out.  Right.  It's almost like they, somebody pointed one thing out to me on Twitter which made sense.  I'm like, I don't like this kowtowing to it.  Yeah.  And he's like, we're at war with three Islamic countries or two.  We're not kissing their asses. 
[00:24:30]  It's like, this phony politeness is annoying.  Yeah, that's what gets me, the phony politeness, and the fact that a lot of people on Twitter,  because I had a little Twitter battle last night also.  Yeah, we were going at the same time, me and Jimmy.  I had a Twitter battle also, and the majority of the people were like, saying that you don't  have faith in the Navy SEALs that they killed them.  I'm like, no, dumb fuck.  And I wish there were enough fucking characters to make my point sometimes.  Sometimes I've just got to blow off the fucking thing. 
[00:25:00]  It has nothing to do with a conspiracy theory or anything.  I 100% believe Bin Laden is dead.  Don't worry about that.  He's dead.  If I hear one more fucking person call me a conspiracy, a deather, or this, that, or the  other thing, you're a fucking moron.  I believe he's dead.  Why do I want to see the pictures?  This is a guy that killed thousands of Americans.  I was and am infuriated that it's his fucking plan. 
[00:25:30]  He financially backed it.  And I want to see his fucking head blown open for my own satisfaction.  To see the guy that fucking put this together or helped put this together, at least financed  it, helped plan it, killed so many people, made me feel so angry, helpless, sad, everything  for a long time.  I want to see, I want some final fucking, I'm not going to use the word closure, I just 
[00:26:00]  want some finality of the thing.  I want to see a bullet hole in his ugly fuckhead.  And that's why I want to see it.  No, no political, nothing deep, nothing profound.  No, I don't believe it.  Just show me his fucking split open skull.  We're not that kind of people.  No, I am.  Don't speak for me, motherfucker.  But you know what?  That Brown, what was his name?  Senator Brown who came out and said, I didn't realize he said he saw the photos.  He saw the fake one. 
[00:26:30]  The fake one that we've been laughing at for days.  That's almost embarrassing.  It's very embarrassing.  It is.  And the people that keep tweeting it that think it's real, check it out, here it is.  I might have thought it was real for a half a second, but you got a senator really believing  that he saw the death photo of Osama bin Laden.  Dude, I'm gullible.  That is embarrassing.  I bought it until either you or Danny said, and then the one in the green looked real.  I buy that shit.  That one I almost bought.  I almost bought.  The one that looked like night vision?  Yeah, we already talked about this.  I almost bought it.  I know.  Until I realized that bin Laden in that one was like smiling. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  I almost bought that one.  It's like he's pop locking.  That's not good.  Did you see the Reuters photos yesterday?  Yeah.  Those are 100% real.  Of course those are real.  And people are confused.  We didn't release those.  What happened was when we took Osama bin Laden's body away, everyone else marched into the  compound, and you had some photographers taking pictures of everything and video of everything,  and someone else released those yesterday.  But those are absolutely fucking real.  Oh, yeah.  I love the guy with the bullet hole to his chinny-chin-chin. 
[00:27:30]  Dude, and there's one laying on a plastic toy.  Yeah, you can see the toy underneath them.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, toy guns, right?  Water pistols or something I saw in one photo.  Don't go against Navy SEALs with water pistols.  Yeah, I'm kidding.  They're pretty used to the water.  The water seals.  But these are absolutely fucking real.  Oh, yeah.  You could just imagine what Osama bin Laden looked like, because these guys, you know, don't  look good.  That chopper crash actually, in a way, helped prove that he's dead, because they would have  taken, they said, his, you know, the body of his, probably, I'm guessing, his young wife 
[00:28:00]  and the daughter that survived, but they couldn't fit everybody on the chopper, so they had to  leave them there.  And the daughter is saying, I'm wondering, when they shot him, is there a reason, is  there something fishy about where they shot him?  She's saying he was alive for 10 minutes.  I don't know if that's true or not.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But did they shoot him outside?  Did they fucking take off with him?  Who the fuck knows?  We're never going to know.  And the helicopter's another mystery.  People are looking at that helicopter part going, we ain't never seen nothing like this. 
[00:28:30]  They're speculating it's some kind of a real stealthy helicopter that was able to fly in  to Pakistan and not be noticed, because it's got a lot of stealth technology in some of  those parts that they saw, yeah.  And there wasn't a firefight that came out overnight or yesterday.  No, one guy took a few pot shots at him from a guest house and was summarily dispatched.  And that was it.  But where was he shot?  In the ear?  He's shot in the head.  But man, these are as gruesome as they get. 
[00:29:00]  And the world are going to see these pictures that Reuters released yesterday.  That guy should just hold his head back and put a tissue up that nostril.  That could last for a while.  So you can just imagine what Osama looks like, obviously.  That's my favorite one.  Right in his chinny, chin, chin.  He's got two mouths.  Dude, a second ago.  Not even between his chin and his lower teeth.  Yeah.  What a spot.  He was headshot.  Look at the...  I love looking at the weird stuff in that photo.  Like, what is that behind that little cup? 
[00:29:30]  Like, was he holding a cup and trying to avoid stepping on that little toy because it's late  and he's always stepping on it and yelling at that kid?  And then blammo.  Was he having a nice cup of coffee or something?  I want to see the woman's body, Bin Laden's wife who jumped in front of him.  Yeah, I don't know why they don't have that picture, but they have three or four photos  as Reuters.  Muslims are weird about that stuff.  Like, even the guys that, like, Al-Zarqawi's people, when they killed the British woman who  was over there and had, was like a, what's the word, a missionary?  Missionary, yeah.  That was a lot of shame.  Yeah.  And no one released her death photos. 
[00:30:00]  Margaret Hassan, I think.  I tweeted this shit if you haven't seen it yet, but I think most people have.  Reuters, wow.  You get shot in the head.  It makes it tougher to not release the Osama Bin Laden photo when the world's seeing this  shit.  We're seeing that.  How much worse could it be than that?  You know what the fucked up thing is?  When you get shot in the head, you get goofy eyes.  Like, look at all, look at his eyes.  He's got goofy eyes.  Just proves that muscles really control your eyes.  Oh, they really do.  Because when those muscles die, the eyes just go. 
[00:30:30]  Eyes just go all wacky and goofy.  They go Artie Johnson on you.  Yes.  There's a lot of blood.  There's a lot of fucking blood.  We got the audio of Obama explaining why no death photos.  Did you see the pictures?  Yes.  What was your reaction when you saw them?  It was him.  Why haven't you released them?  You know, we discussed this internally. 
[00:31:00]  Keep in mind that we are absolutely certain this was him.  We've done DNA sampling.  Not the point.  And testing.  And so there is no doubt that we killed Osama bin Laden.  I believe you.  I believe it too.  It is important for us to make sure that very graphic photos of somebody who was shot in the head  are not floating around as an incitement to additional violence as a propaganda tool. 
[00:31:30]  You know, that's not who we are.  Propaganda tool.  That means on t-shirts all over the place, by the way.  The only reason I'm debating my stance on it is because the propaganda tool.  Well, if you talk about when they did that shit in the fucking jails, all those pictures came out.  Yeah, Abu Ghraib.  That's when the beheading started.  And they put them, when they would behead people, that's why they put them in orange jumpsuits. 
[00:32:00]  It was because of Abu Ghraib.  It was because that was what those prisoners had been wearing.  But that was what really began those beheadings.  And it's like you're not dealing with people who think like you think.  And these imams spin this stuff to people who don't have access to our net.  They're not hearing this.  They don't have fucking CNN.  All they're getting is Al Jazeera and imams.  So imams tell them whatever they're going to tell them and show them those pictures.  And then they're like, well, what are these Americans doing?  But those people have got to be beyond pissed to begin with.  He's dead. 
[00:32:30]  So why is the picture going to be the final thing that makes them really go nuts?  Because there are conspiracy people there too, not just here.  And there are plenty of people in the Arab world that don't think he's dead.  And maybe they like the idea that there's that doubt.  Plays into the conspiracy guys, but whatever.  Maybe.  So what happens now?  The first terrorist attack that happens, we go, okay, here are the pictures.  I guess that didn't work.  I guess holding the pictures back didn't work.  God, people still hate us.  Because there's going to be a retaliation of some kind.  I don't know.  I'm just.  Of some kind.  And there are guys just chomping at the bit to be the guy. 
[00:33:00]  Yep.  That retaliates the Osama killing.  Phones are lit, man.  Well, you know what?  Maybe they won't release the photos because they don't exist.  Oh, man.  I'm sorry.  I'm just reading.  Oh, God.  My friend Troy Kwan's Twitter.  I love Troy here.  I love Troy.  I follow Troy Kwan on Twitter.  He tweeted this.  Maybe they won't release the photos because they don't exist.  No, I'm just.  Where's Troy? 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  That's the.  What I have to realize with Troy is I like Troy.  He's my friend.  So I have to let my friend think what he thinks.  He's got questions, though.  Yeah, he's my friend.  And Troy Kwan, everyone.  Kwan-spiracy.  Speak your mind, sir.  You don't think there's photos of Osama bin Laden dead?  I mean, I don't know.  Do you know for sure?  You're told, right?  Who tells us?  Well, the government's really saying that they're out there.  Well, let's see him. 
[00:34:00]  Did we kill Osama bin Laden a few days ago?  Did we?  Did we?  Yes.  Well, they're saying we did.  I want to see the pictures.  His daughter said we did.  They did this.  His own daughter said.  This guy orchestrated 9-11 on our soil.  Worst terrorist act on our soil.  I want justification.  I want to see a bullet in that motherfucker's head.  Sure.  Hold on.  You're being hypocritical, though, because you think the government did 9-11.  So why would it matter?  No, I didn't say that.  I said that they may have been involved with it.  You kind of think.  I never said that the government. 
[00:34:30]  You kind of think the government has a big involvement in 9-11.  I said that they may have had something to do with it.  Maybe they let it go.  So then Osama bin Laden should not mean anything to you, then, if you think the government might have something to do with it.  Well, I mean, everybody thinks he's the boogeyman.  He's the bad guy.  Let's see it.  He's the one responsible for it.  Let's see.  I want to see a bullet in that motherfucker's head.  Does it affect your...  I agree.  Wait, but we all agree.  But you want to see the pictures because you don't really think that he's dead or that the pictures exist.  That's the difference.  Well, his daughter is saying that they killed him.  Like, it's 100% confirmed because people who were there, who we should have had choppered out but couldn't because the fucking chopper crashed. 
[00:35:00]  So they had to pick and choose what they brought.  But did she say that?  I'll play Troy Kwan's.  Yeah, because that's not coming from our media.  That's coming from the Pakistanis.  But where's that audio?  I want to see that.  I want to hear that.  Okay, I'm sure we could probably get that.  Or the statement.  That's coming from the Pakistanis.  If it was released, though, wouldn't then the focus switch to, well, I don't believe the validity of these pictures?  I mean, it depends what the pictures look like.  You know?  I mean, I'm not the one that always has to say, okay, this is what I've been told.  Automatically, this is the truth. 
[00:35:30]  Agreed.  So, I just want to see them.  That's all.  And maybe they're...  Yeah, but you tweeted because they don't exist.  Well, I like seeing people's reactions to when I say shit like that because they get angry.  It's almost like they're angry at me for not automatically believing what I'm told right away.  People are like, fuck you for believing that.  Fuck you.  And it's like...  I personally can't prove that they exist.  I just have a strong feeling they do.  Okay.  But that's not why I disagree.  I don't think that you're wrong to not believe what you're... 
[00:36:00]  I think conspiracy theorists sometimes think that because that's their way of feeling like they're not being irrational.  I don't...  But I don't just believe what I'm told like a moron or get mad at a conspiracy...  Because that almost says conspiracy theorists are going, we're never being irrational.  They're just mad because we don't march in the same line.  That's not true.  Right, man.  That's 100% justifying the way they feel and 100% making anyone who thinks that the government did tell them the truth about something is an idiot.  It's not right.  That's not why I disagree with conspiracy theorists or why they annoy me because they ignore all evidence that goes against making something a conspiracy and they take one little granule of evidence or weird anomaly and misdad evidence. 
[00:36:30]  Like this.  That's why they annoy me.  Like this.  This plays right into the conspiracy guys that the photos aren't being released.  But again, there are people on the other side of that that say that ought to just believe, yes, this is what happened, but there are big things missing from that puzzle where you go...  They look past that. 
[00:37:00]  Like, I hate bringing this up because we've gone down this road before, but 9-11.  There's video missing of the planes crashing into the Pentagon.  So why can't...  You know, why do you look past that?  Because I've seen video that was right there at the Pentagon.  Last night, as a matter of fact, on Smithsonian Channel, I saw a program where there was a videographer who was right there on scene.  Thing is smoldering.  And showed a piece of aluminum from a plane with a big C, red C, silver background, American Airlines. 
[00:37:30]  It was a fucking plane.  Right.  And all the pictures, when you go to those pictures, there's a piece of aluminum sitting out in the yard.  There's nothing of a...  Any sort of signs of a plane that have crashed into the Pentagon from all those pictures.  It's completely eviscerated.  It's gone.  It's gone.  Just like the black boxes, just like...  That's kind of what happens in a lot of these plane crashes.  Black boxes aren't made...  People think black boxes are indestructible.  They're not. 
[00:38:00]  And they're made for 99% of plane crashes.  They're recoverable.  But when you take a plane full throttle into a cement wall, the black box isn't going to survive.  It's not made of fucking...  Some adamantium.  And there's two of them, but yet a passport makes it.  Did you ever see footage...  Yeah, but you're looking at...  Again, a lot of paper made it out.  But see, there's just little things.  It's just like...  It's just like paper.  It's raining on paper for fucking hours.  They take any anomaly, any weird thing...  Right.  You avoid video evidence of two planes crashing into those buildings and hang on to the fact 
[00:38:30]  that something odd...  Well, something just doesn't make sense in my head.  Paper will not have as much kinetic energy in it, by the way, as something with more mass  to it.  So paper actually has a better chance of surviving, unless it's burnt up, in an impact than something  heavier.  It's just...  It's physics.  But you're crashing into a building, and there's an explosion.  Yeah.  A lot of paper.  From the impact. 
[00:39:00]  The passport's probably with the guy in the cockpit, or close to it.  First of all, the explosion is behind the cockpit.  I mean, how much room is between the cockpit and where the...  But it was still where the impact was.  That thing doing about 300 fucking miles an hour?  No, more than that.  Believe me.  600.  That thing will fucking fly forward.  Everything will go forward.  The fire will start at the wings, and behind the wings, and a passport could absolutely  survive.  And do they...  Think about it.  If it's a plant, why would you plant it? 
[00:39:30]  Like, that's...  It's such an odd piece of evidence.  Who the fuck would go, yeah, the plane crashed into the building.  Let's slip the passport down here on Vessi Street.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, it's too fucking...  All they had to do...  Again, if they're going to go through all that trouble, just...  If they found the car with Korans and all the plans in it, just leave a note in there.  Like, this is what drives me crazy.  I know.  The conspiracy guys will ignore video evidence to take that anomaly, which no investigator 
[00:40:00]  making a plant would fucking make.  No investigator who's setting this up would do that as the towers are collapsed.  It's an impossibility.  Right.  That they would plant some...  Because, again, it's such a weird thing.  People are going to go, how the fuck did this get here?  No one looks at that alone and goes, aha, that's how we know Muhammad Atta was the...  Right.  You know, come on, man.  It's just a crazy thing to do.  No?  I mean, there's other instances of things that just don't line up.  So that it puts that shadow of doubt in your mind. 
[00:40:30]  It's not a...  For me, it's not a clear...  By the way, I look at the paper and stuff blowing in.  It's just a shitload of paper.  Yeah, but that's from other floors.  I mean, it's something inside the plane.  No, man, there's the paper from those floors and above fucking...  It started raining down on the street, man.  Yeah.  Were you here...  Oh, this is horrifying.  Were you around for 9-11?  Yeah, really.  I was in Pennsylvania.  I was living in Pennsylvania.  All right, but we lived here.  We saw it raining paper.  No, and it's clear on the video.  Raining paper for hours because of the wind and shit.  I didn't have to be in New York City to see it raining paper. 
[00:41:00]  It was just blowing around.  Didn't some of the paper make it to Brooklyn, if I'm not mistaken?  Oh, that's Brooklyn.  Yeah, I saw it.  Yep, did, absolutely.  No, I mean, it's just, it's things like this where you go, hey, you know, it puts a shadow  of a doubt in your mind that, hey, maybe it's not exactly like it's been told.  And as far as video evidence, back in 2001, we all didn't have cameras on our phones.  We, there was only two, how many, two or three videos of the planes hitting.  No, man, there was one, there was two.  Yeah.  One that they knew they had and one that surfaced a year later, a guy almost erased it.  Right, and then the second one, obviously, everyone had because the news crews were on 
[00:41:30]  the scene, you know, but we weren't all just walking around with cameras.  It was a lot harder to capture shit back then.  Believe it or not.  And the Pentagon is not a place where people just hanging out with video cameras.  Right.  Well, hey.  And it's like, and like a perfect example is we're just talking about, you know, like  the government, yeah, okay, we don't have to trust the government.  But then one of bin Laden's daughters through Pakistani news agencies has said he's dead.  Okay.  And it's like, but the conspiracy guys plow over, it's almost like something in their 
[00:42:00]  mind because that will kind of go again.  It doesn't allow them to really weigh that and go, that is a real thing.  If bin Laden's daughter, who hates us, is saying he was killed, that's a, but you know,  when they just.  It would help their cause to say they, the U.S. did not get them.  Yeah.  When they, when they don't show the pictures.  That would rally a lot of people.  Like he survived the United States trying to take him out.  And we know for a fact he's not dead and he's somewhere else now.  That would be an amazing victory for that side.  But that's why conspiracy theorists. 
[00:42:30]  And no one is saying that.  It has nothing to do with the fact that they're not buying what they're told.  That's not why they annoy me at all.  And you can't shortchange that.  It is simply because, you know, you mentioned bin Laden's daughter coming through Pakistani  which is not our media.  It's not our government.  They're fucking, they're radical Muslims most of them.  They hate us.  And they're saying it.  Yeah.  And that's still not enough.  Well, what about the, like, there's always the pictures.  And if the pictures come out, there will be a problem with the pictures.  Because the goal is to make it a conspiracy. 
[00:43:00]  Not to find out what they do.  The goal is always to make it a conspiracy.  Absolutely.  God, I love that.  Here's what I was thinking.  You're right, Jimmy.  They don't release the pictures because the wound over his eye is an exit wound.  Ah!  That's funny.  Ah!  All right.  No, I haven't heard that one brought up yet.  Maybe he was fucking executed like that, huh?  Now, Troy, you tweeted that because they don't exist, but you said you wrote that to fuck  with people.  Is that real?  I like seeing people's reactions to it because you have to believe exactly what you're told 
[00:43:30]  when you're told it on the television.  Don't answer my question with a question.  Do you believe there's death photos of Osama bin Laden?  I'd like to believe there are.  But do you?  Do you?  Yes or no?  I'm having a hard time.  But I believe it.  I'm skeptical about everything.  I believe it.  I'm skeptical about everything.  When you...  I believe it, but I can't prove it to you, obviously.  When you don't show the photos...  Just say you don't believe it.  I told you, I'm having a hard time believing it.  When you don't show the photos and you dispose of the body real quick, it's going to raise 
[00:44:00]  some questions, especially with people that are skeptical.  Well, they didn't want to piss off Islam.  Well, that's pretty much...  So, according to tradition, they did what is proper.  So, when you questioned...  I'm sure they weren't happy about it.  When you questioned...  And I'm sure it wasn't a nice fucking funeral, by the way, on the ship that they want to make  it out to be.  It was a shitty 40 minutes of probably a lot of booing going on from up top.  I love how they make it sound like it was a movie funeral.  Trust me.  I guarantee that didn't happen. 
[00:44:30]  Go ahead, Troy.  They're showing other things from some of the planes that hit the World Trade Center.  You're pointing to that?  You can't carry that over?  Put it in a van?  Oh, stop.  What are you saying?  When you question the intent of a lot of the moves of our government, when things happen  like this, where there's big holes missing, you have to...  People question it.  But, Troy, what does that have to...  Like, you say that, but what does our government have to do with bin Laden's daughter saying 
[00:45:00]  to Pakistani authorities that they killed her father?  Is she in on it?  Like, now, how does that...  Do we pay her off to say that?  What happens if you're like, look, we'll take care of you for the rest of your life,  your family for the rest of your life?  Do you really...  First of all, he's a billionaire.  He's a billionaire, bin Laden.  She had access to bin Laden's money.  She didn't turn him in for the $27 million reward money.  So, all of a sudden, she's going to lie...  It doesn't make sense.  That's an impossibility.  That somebody that close to him turned him in.  Like I said, when there's big pieces of the puzzle missing... 
[00:45:30]  But there aren't.  You quit.  There really aren't.  The photos?  That's not a big piece of the puzzle?  No.  For our curiosity...  See, having the body exposed within 24 hours and dumped in the ocean is not a big piece  of the puzzle?  For our vengeance, and I agree with you, yeah, but I believe...  I don't think the president is on television lying, saying that he saw the photos.  I just don't think he's doing that.  Because if it was that easy, then Bush would have done it and fucking made himself look a  lot better because his legacy is horrendous.  I don't believe that the president is on TV lying about having seen bin Laden's... 
[00:46:00]  The magnitude of that, if it came out, is a scandal that...  You can't.  It's just an impossibility.  You can't be re-elected.  That's a big chance to take.  I do believe him.  I do not like the decision because I have the same thing.  But why don't you just admit to yourself, at least, I'm fucking angry because I want  to see it.  And it's almost like when parents say we can't do something, we're like, okay, well, then  I'll hold my breath.  And that's kind of what it is.  He's not giving us our way, so the thing is, well, I bet you don't have him. 
[00:46:30]  I bet you don't have him.  When deep down, does it make sense to you that Obama...  I guess because there's a long line of liars, but you think Obama's just sitting out  on TV saying, yes, I've seen the photos, and yes, it was him?  You know, we've been lied to before, Jim.  We've been lied to before.  That's your stance.  All right.  Yeah.  We're not going to change this.  Just know for yourself that the conspiracy stuff is not just the incident.  It's important to you to make it a conspiracy for some reason because it satisfies some  other...  And I told you before, I'm not a conspiracy theorist. 
[00:47:00]  I'm skeptical of the intentions of a lot of moves our government makes.  What do you think that...  What do you disagree with on conspiracy theorists?  Like, what conspiracy do you think actually wasn't a conspiracy theory that they were wrong  about?  Well, I mean, you know, I occasionally listen to Alex Jones, and he comes up with a lot  of ridiculous shit, and you're just like...  He sucks.  No, he doesn't suck.  I mean, I find him...  No, he really sucks.  I find him entertaining.  We should get a piece of his audio every fucking day, and we'll fucking blow holes through it. 
[00:47:30]  Like, the other day with that Madeleine Albright horse shit, being a radio guy, we know a lot  more than...  We know a lot about radio than the person listening to us right now.  You play the audio.  You just don't say that she said that.  Well, that came out that she said it backstage to a guy, and I know he's taken out of conscience.  That would hammer his fucking point home, but he knows that the audio doesn't exist,  so he fucking blew by it.  And then dummies believe what he's saying.  He sucks.  That's why I think he's great when he's on the show with you guys, because you guys aren't 
[00:48:00]  afraid to challenge him.  We beat the shit out of him every time he was on.  And I like hearing that.  It's great radio.  He tries to talk over all of us with the names and stuff, and as soon as you slow the fucking  guy down, he starts stammering.  Way worse than I do, by the way.  Well, I mean, call him out on it, you know?  We did.  And we did recently.  We banged holes through his latest...  Poor shit.  Get his opinion on this.  I'd love to hear him on the show with...  He blew it, I'm telling you.  He had a nice little gig, but he... 
[00:48:30]  He sucks.  I want to see...  Enough with Alex Jones.  The pictures, because I want to see them.  Honestly, I really do want to see them.  Yeah, he does want to see them.  I believe them.  What is he saying about the picture thing?  Oh, he's...  I can't wait to hear that one.  It is.  You know, I haven't even...  Make sure we get that audio.  But it's...  I want to see them, because I want...  Like Ant said, too, I want to see a hole in his fucking disgusting head.  But I know they exist.  I really do believe it.  In my gut, I believe that they exist.  It's coming from too many sources.  And even the Arab world is accepting it, like the majority of them.  But those news agencies would love nothing. 
[00:49:00]  You're telling me Al Jazeera would love to embarrass the United States and fucking...  And find proof that he's alive?  Oh, yeah.  That every single militant Islamic person would love to do that.  And the bottom line is his own family is saying he's dead.  He's dead.  And don't kid yourself.  We will see the picture eventually.  Yeah, maybe.  It might be years at this point.  You know, a lot of people are like,  Oh, right in time for the election.  If that's the truth...  It might take years.  But we will see it eventually. 
[00:49:30]  I hope you're right.  Because someone will have a copy that just fucking thinks they trust somebody else.  That's how it all works.  There's a doctor on the phone before we take a break.  You know what?  I don't know.  She says she's seen the photo.  She has not.  She's a doctor in D.C.  Oh.  Hi, guys.  Hello.  You've seen the Osama bin Laden photo.  Obviously, none of us in this room will believe you.  But what do you got on this?  I'm in the military.  I'm an active duty doctor. 
[00:50:00]  And we had a general come through the other day.  And he had a picture on his back there.  And he showed us.  So you're calling a radio show to tell us?  We don't believe you.  I can tell you what it looked like.  Okay.  Is it the photo that...  No, what's it look like?  Maybe she's right.  Oh, you never know.  What's it look like?  No, they had cleaned up his face, so there wasn't any blood.  You could see the bullet hole above his left.  It was more central, but it was above his left eye.  And it looks like they had shoved something into his eye socket. 
[00:50:30]  Like they had blown out the eye socket, but to keep the integrity of his face, they had  shoved something white in there.  Hold on.  Danny, look at the picture we saw.  Hold on, sweetheart.  Because I heard...  First one.  Hold on.  You know what?  She might be telling the truth.  I want to check something.  Because you said they shoved something in his eye.  Hold on.  The picture that...  Our computer's slow.  We're trying to find something here.  Yes.  What else can you tell us about it?  Yeah.  It was small, and I mean, he was trying to show a couple people at once. 
[00:51:00]  I didn't see it very well.  I mean, obviously, he wasn't supposed to be.  Oh, really?  Well, I think that's how the picture gets out eventually.  What's it doing?  Other people...  Shit.  Yeah, some people...  This is a new computer, right?  There we go.  Hold on one second.  Don't go anywhere.  What part of D.C. do you work in?  Oh, you know what I'm saying?  One of the military bases down here, I'd rather not say.  Okay, let me ask you.  So, it looked like they shoved a piece of...  Oh, my God, no.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  I think that you said something. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, my God, no.  What else?  Wait, hold on.  What else was on in the photo?  Sorry.  Doctor, what else was in the photo?  That was it.  It was just a face shot.  Did he have a bandage or anything anywhere or no?  I've heard about this, but from a military guy.  I don't remember.  What about his head?  Did he have any marks on his forehead besides the bullet wound?  Hello?  I'm here. 
[00:52:00]  I honestly, I don't remember.  You're saying that the bullet hole was kind of central to his forehead.  It was above his left eye, but more towards the center than directly above the eye.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And what do you do for a living?  I'm a doctor.  Did he have his beard and everything?  Yes.  And what did that look like?  I mean, it looked like they cleaned him up.  Sure.  Like, what did the beard look like, though?  Was he totally gray?  It was darker than some of the pictures recently. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, really?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  And was there blood around his mouth?  Oh, God.  There wasn't, I don't think, right?  None, right?  I've heard there wasn't.  Yeah.  A lot of times it'll happen when you're mid-speech that there's no blood around your mouth.  I mean, it looked like, you know, there was, his skin was intact around the bullet hole.  It was like one of those high-speed rifles that just go.  Right.  Odd, too, right?  That the forehead was a different skin tone than the actual lower part of the face, which 
[00:53:00]  will a lot of times happen.  It wasn't that photo.  Oh, you're describing that one to a T.  You're describing that photo.  You just described the photo.  That came out right away.  Everything in his eye, there's his black beard that's darker than it should be.  Oh, God.  The bullet hole closer to the middle of his head than over the left eye, cleaned up a little  bit.  Yeah. 
[00:53:30]  No, you're talking about the photo, ma'am.  That's fake.  So, a four-star general had the fake photo?  Yes.  Yeah, why not?  Just like Senator Brown saw, Senator saw a fake photo, too.  Yeah, why not?  Yeah, Senator Brown saw that exact photo and thought it was real.  So, a lot of gullible people.  I understand when the picture first hit, but four days later, you've got to stop.  Oh, wait a minute.  You've just got to stop with this shit.  Was there green coloring, a green tint to it, or no?  I don't remember.  You don't remember?  I haven't seen the photo you guys are talking about yet, so. 
[00:54:00]  All right, listen.  You didn't see the photo.  I don't think you saw the photo.  You didn't.  I thought I'm sorry.  A general's probably trying to show you a cockpit, and he landed on something else.  You think there was some guy that had to collect everyone's phones, and they're like,  oh, come on, dude.  Yeah.  He's just erasing, erasing phones.  You didn't see the photo.  I hate to tell you.  All right.  Or maybe everyone had to throw their phones in with Osama.  Google it and see if it turns up on Google, the same one you saw. 
[00:54:30]  And if it did, then it's fake.  We've got a colonel on the line from the Marine Corps.  Oh.  He wants in on this.  Colonel.  Hey, guys.  She's full of shit.  If you did see a picture, it's a doctor one.  No general's going to walk around showing a picture.  Exactly.  And most generals aren't even going to have access to it.  I work in a very compartmentalized area here in the D.C. area.  We haven't seen it.  We're not going to see it.  It's staying with the soft community and with the highest levels of government.  She hasn't seen it.  Let me ask you this, sir.  I don't know if you know the answer to this.  In that situation, how many pictures could have possibly been taken by different individuals? 
[00:55:00]  I don't know about how many individuals.  There'll probably be a whole collection of pictures, but all of them will be highly classified,  and they'll keep them.  But how about you're one of the guys on the ship before they threw him in?  Is it possible for any of those guys to get a quick picture with a cell phone or something?  More than likely, when they brought it back, the people on the ship didn't even realize  what they were bringing back.  So they wouldn't have known him probably almost until he was thrown into the water. 
[00:55:30]  And at that point, they're going to keep everybody far away for just that reason,  because everyone's got a cell phone.  Everyone's got a flip camera.  So everyone would have been kept pretty far and clear away from it.  Oh, wow, because I picture that the whole ship just stopped doing what they were doing  to watch this whole thing go down.  Yeah, I'm not sure.  Yeah, I know you're not sure, but you've got way more knowledge than us.  Yeah, I would tell you that something like that, when the SEALs come on board the ship,  a lot of times you don't even know what they have done. 
[00:56:00]  Even the SEALs in the prep for the mission, they didn't know for probably almost a week beforehand  of what they were actually prepping to do for the mission.  But plus, that's how compartmentalized that kind of information is.  Plus, isn't it also like a guy like Lindy England and those people from Abu Ghraib,  the photos got out, because they were kind of just regular foot soldiers.  But people with this level of clearance are a little bit different.  Yeah, that's a lot different.  You know, this is something, if Abu Ghraib taught them anything, it's about pictures 
[00:56:30]  and certainly put idiots in charge of prisons.  But in something like this, with a high-level, with Osama bin Laden,  they're not just going to let all the sailors on a boat take pictures and then get it out,  because they're going to want to control that information.  So it's going to be pretty tough to see this picture, huh?  I think so.  Like I said, I work in an area where we have access to top-secret information.  We've been searching on the high side for that thing.  It's nowhere to be found.  How great is it that this guy has that type of job, and they're doing exactly what we're doing, 
[00:57:00]  just searching around, hoping that they come upon it?  Yeah, well, you know, we want to see it just as bad as anybody else.  Of course.  They have his forehead gone, but it's just not going to happen.  They've got that thing pretty tightly wrapped.  Hey, do you agree with Obama's stance on this?  You know, I'm not in his shoes.  I think for a lot of reasons, I think the American public deserves to see it.  But he's the president, and he's got other things he's got to consider.  So I don't want to second-guess him. 
[00:57:30]  He's the boss.  He's the guy with the ultimate decision authority.  I think you're right, though.  I think eventually you will see it.  But I think right now, at least for the short term, you will not.  Is he a better—we were talking last night, and I think he's a better commander-in-chief  than a lot of people thought he would be, myself included.  Like, his domestic stuff, people thought, okay, that would be his strong point.  But it seems like the domestic stuff is where he's kind of falling apart.  And as a commander-in-chief, he's actually been, I think, better than people expected him to be. 
[00:58:00]  Why are you doing this to Anthony tonight?  No, but I mean, really, he's not—he sent the troops to Afghanistan.  He's already mad because of the traffic situation.  He fucking fired bombs into Libya.  Like, he's done a lot more than I would have thought he would have done as a commander-in-chief.  Hey, Jimmy, I'm not really allowed.  I shouldn't really comment on whether I think he's a good commander-in-chief or not.  All right.  Hey, Dan in Jersey has a twit pic of Osama.  Should we go there next?  Yes!  Watch out, fellas.  Bye.  Thank you.  Thank you, Colonel.  Ah, there you go.  I love thinking that those guys are searching for the picture, too.  Poor Troy's in hell.  Troy. 
[00:58:30]  Conspiracy is so funny, man.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  What's the twit pic?  I would love to see it.  Really?  Yeah, sure.  Let me say hi to Dan in Jersey.  Dan.  Hey.  Hey, Dan.  Hey.  If you look up my Twitter, it's D-Lyman, L-Y-M-A-N, 8667.  That's brilliant, man.  You just got a lot of fucking followers.  Sure.  Hold on.  D-Lyman.  Hold on, sweetie pie.  If this is a fucking virus, we're going to come to your house and punch you.  No, it's not a virus. 
[00:59:00]  It was sent to me on Tuesday.  D-Lyman what?  8667.  8667.  All right.  D-Lyman.  How do you spell Lyman?  L-Y-M-A-N.  Okay.  Hold on, my flower.  Your tweets are protected, asshole.  I said your tweets are protected.  You can't even look at them.  If you got the Osama bin Laden death photo, why would you have your tweets protected?  Why are your tweets protected?  I normally don't tweet, so I don't know how to unprotect it.  Well, this is useless then.  Oh, my God.  We're this close to the death photo, and your tweets are protected. 
[00:59:30]  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  So how are we supposed to see them?  How do I unprotect it?  I'll unprotect it and retweet it.  All right.  How do you do that?  I don't know.  Do we know?  Hold on a line.  Hold on a line.  He has two followers.  Yeah, exactly.  He's trying to get followers.  You have to follow him to see his tweets.  No, I'm not trying to get followers.  His two followers were Osama and the other one's Obama.  Oh, of course.  So he's in the nest.  I'm trying to get followers.  All right, Dan.  Hold on a line. 
[01:00:00]  We're going to try to work through this.  You're panicking.  And I'm going to make sure I don't hang up on you because, wow, this is just breaking  news.  Yes.  We're going to be the first ones with the death photo.  Imagine if it was.  And here's a guy that's fucking pissed at Troy.  He worked at the Pentagon that day.  Joey in D.C.  Joey.  Hey, what's going on?  Look, he's dead.  The picture is not going to come out anytime soon.  I understand the president's stance on why he doesn't want to release the photo.  But I don't agree with some of the arguments. 
[01:00:30]  I actually got into a pretty nice argument yesterday with somebody who said it was disgusting.  And my answer was, you twat.  If you want to see something disgusting, go do a search for two girls, one cup.  Yeah.  Punch it out.  And what was disgusting to a lot of us was after 9-11 happened and the planes hit, to  watch fucking bodies jump out of windows.  Yeah.  We saw some horrific shit that day.  But we're not like that.  See, we have to separate ourselves, man. 
[01:01:00]  We've seen Kennedy's head coming off in video.  We've seen RFK photos.  We can handle it.  We can handle it.  But it's not that.  I know, but he says the graphic photos.  He doesn't want to incite the Muslims.  You know what?  Simple as this.  The worst thing I've ever seen in my life was those people fucking jumping from the towers.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  I can't think of anything else that was worse than that.  Can't really watch that.  No.  No.  Can't watch that.  And I can't watch beheadings.  Because people always ask, where's your line? 
[01:01:30]  And just knowing, you know, those people were choosing to jump.  Yeah.  Because that was a better death than burning alive.  Because the heat was getting to them.  I don't, you know.  Can't.  That's the worst thing I've ever seen in my life.  Simple as that.  And then when they had fucking reporters down there and you hear the bodies hitting.  Yeah.  You hear the pfft.  And then I forgot who it was who finally explained what the noise was.  You just heard the glass breaking.  They're falling through awnings and fucking atriums and stuff. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, it was terrible.  You see the picture on the paper today?  What?  A lovesick fucking teenager.  I would love to talk to these teenagers someday.  What happened?  We all get our hearts broken.  Stop jumping out of buildings.  Oh, you're kidding, really?  There's a picture.  Give me your, give me, yeah, let me see that real quick.  Dylan, the post.  It was 36th Street.  Very close to here, about 10 blocks or so.  So, kid, lovesick kid jumps out a building and you get to see the dent where he hit a bus. 
[01:02:30]  He hit a bus?  Well, you know, the bus was parked at the bottom there.  It might be in the other paper.  You got the other paper?  Selfish fucking people.  And then there was a detective with his camera phone, kind of looking up, taking a picture,  trying to figure some angles out.  Taking a little snapshot.  And the bus is dented from where the body fucking hit before it landed on the sidewalk. 
[01:03:00]  And maybe these are new additions.  Now I can't find the phone.  So is the way, right?  Oh, here it is.  Yeah, your death wasn't that important.  It's on page 32, asshole.  Fuck you.  You're not front page material.  But look at the...  I almost want to tweet this.  Look at the fucking desk.  Ow!  On the top of the bus.  There's the body and there's the detective with the cell phone camera.  It's a great picture, actually.  Yeah, that's a lot of fun.  Read what it says below the pictures for everybody. 
[01:03:30]  Detective checks out the site of lovesick teen suicide on 6th Avenue and 36th Street yesterday.  With the corpse at his feet, sources say the 19-year-old, whose name was withheld,  was distraught over a recent breakup when he jumped from a building denting the top of a city bus in the fall.  Except for the driver, the QM1 bus was empty and no one was injured.  Wow.  So...  Damn, yo.  And seeing that picture reminded me of 9-11 when people were jumping out of the buildings. 
[01:04:00]  What floor did they jump from?  I don't know if they say...  But to the teenagers out there, you're not even going to remember that fucking bimbo that broke your heart.  Oh, show her.  Oh, show her.  You're not even going to...  Dummy.  There's going to be a million of those before you figure it out and maybe fall in love.  Yeah.  Stop with that fucking suicide over a chick.  Right.  Or a guy, for that matter.  You know, I guess it's happening both ways.  Jesus.  What page is it on, Gregorio? 
[01:04:30]  32.  Ooh, in the old Daily News.  Let's take a look.  I want to see this dented bus.  I love dented bus tops.  You're a fan of the dented bus?  Yeah, it was actually the name of a band I was in in high school.  Dented bus tops.  That means one poor soul has to, like...  I heard you.  I didn't.  Has to kind of duck for his whole bus ride inside.  Because it's dented.  Oh, boy.  Boo!  I wonder...  Be more funny!  Why would I try?  Wow.  What fucking... 
[01:05:00]  What part of his body do you think hit it?  You think he did a header?  Uh...  I have a lot of respect for the jumpers that go head first.  Oh.  Wow.  A lot of respect for those guys.  Just fucking put your arms to your side, dip your head down.  Dip your head.  Pain.  That would be instant.  Who was the one that...  These guys that have jumped naked off the Empire State Building just so their bodies would  splat...  Like, off the...  Yeah, the Empire.  And you're falling...  You don't hit the ground.  You hit, like, at the...  No, I always hit a ledge.  On the floor or whatever.  Yeah.  Who the fuck has balls enough to do that?  Yeah, it's crazy.  To jump naked. 
[01:05:30]  Do we still have the pictures of the one we got that one day?  What, that big fat guy?  It's right there.  It's dangerous to walk around...  It's dangerous to walk around Manhattan because these assholes decide to jump and they kill  people that are just walking on the sidewalk.  Yeah, just walking around.  And when we were at WNEW, another story that people have heard a million times, but we  do have newer listeners.  We had a jumper at lunchtime.  It was the old Harley Davidson Cafe, I think.  Yep.  They moved that thing, right?  Yeah.  And the guy falling hit some woman with his hand on her shoulder. 
[01:06:00]  She was fine.  Yeah, but it fucked her shoulder up.  I think it broke her shoulder or whatever.  But at least it wasn't her head.  Is that the picture?  Oh, God.  Oh, that's another one.  Look at that guy.  Yeah, that's another one.  Look at that guy.  Ah, it's fucked up right there.  No, we had guys...  Oh, Holly, his leg is bent.  We had a couple guys...  He's got a wedgie.  ...run down immediately and took pictures of the dead body as it was on the sidewalk before  they got rid of it.  Is that a chick?  Is there a bar on it?  Look at the thong in her ass.  She's hot.  Yeah.  What, is she a jumper? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, these are...  It's not the photo we took that day.  When fat people jump, they just like turn...  It looks like they melt.  Just melted.  But this guy...  When I was off the curb, this guy was sidewalk-  That's funny.  Sidewalk fucking pizza.  Hey, did we get the picture from Dan?  Good old Dan?  No.  What happened?  Good old Dan's retarded and he can't seem to figure out how to unprotect his tweet.  It's funny.  He has access to that high-level photograph, but he can't unprotect tweets.  How about you just get a new Twitter name real quick, Dan? 
[01:07:00]  I won't be ignored, Dan.  Or if it's a Twit pic, can't he just give us the URL?  Probably.  I don't know.  I don't know what goes on.  I don't know this, Dan.  I don't know what he does.  He's an asshole.  Tell him you don't want to follow him.  He'll understand.  Believe me.  All right.  He's still on the line if you want to try to talk to him.  Where is Dan?  Isn't he line six?  No, he's gone.  He's gone.  He's gone.  Yeah.  Flag him.  Flag him.  Someone died jumping out of a first story window at Texas State University? 
[01:07:30]  One story.  Get out of here.  Is it a midget?  Let me say hi to Jason in Texas.  Jason.  Good evening.  Good evening.  Did they have a shark tank outside the window?  How do you die for the first story?  Something had to be the punji steaks.  You explain this, Jason, and I want to find the story.  All right.  Well, I just read it in the paper down here, actually, on the internet, at Texas State University.  This chick was an RA.  She was a 24-year-old sophomore, for Christ's sake.  But you can't jump out of a first story window. 
[01:08:00]  It said it was about a six-foot ball, and it happened about three o'clock tomorrow, so  I imagine they were all liquored up.  Right on her neck.  Snap the neck.  She's dead.  Right on her freaking head.  I bet that happened, yeah.  There was another chick that went out after her, and she got injured.  Get out of here.  First story window.  Very injured.  I'm not shitting you, man.  That's some Darwin shit right there.  If you can't survive a first story hop, then do you deserve to live?  If you're a 24-year-old sophomore, you got bigger fucking problems, too, man. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, a 24-year-old sophomore, huh?  Well, really?  Yeah, and she was a little chubby.  It's a real story, man.  Yeah.  First story window.  What's wrong with the computer?  That's got to be a world record.  It's not the computer.  It's just the connection here.  Yeah.  The connection is...  I thought they had to better.  They fixed it for us.  Didn't they give us, like, our own thing?  It's supposed to be good.  Sure they did.  It's still the same source.  It's still the same internet.  It's still accessing the same...  Yeah.  Crap.  Why can't they get us, like, a fucking T-line in here? 
[01:09:00]  Are they going to do that for you?  Who are they going to do it for?  Me.  You know when they show those shows, what happens to cities if, like, humans were completely...  Yeah, weren't around.  That's what I feel like with this radio show, that the weeds are growing all around us.  Yeah.  And the vines, and eventually, we're going to come in here one day, and nothing's going  to work, and that's just going to be it.  It'll just be moss and dirt and leaves.  Everything is slowly but surely breaking down around us.  Yeah.  Including ourselves.  What happens?  It's like, why isn't any of this shit fixed? 
[01:09:30]  I know.  It's just amazing.  Oh, look at the heifer that jumped.  The other one jumped after.  One dead, one injured after leap from dorm window.  Why'd they leap?  Oh.  Can you read the story, Dan?  Just says, one Texas State student is dead, another seriously injured after both leaped  out of a dorm window early Tuesday.  Erin Ann Hicks, 24, who is the bigger of the two.  The bigger of the two.  Yeah.  Died after suffering head and neck injuries from her fall.  I mean, look, she's a big lady.  If you put all that weight on that neck, that's absolutely believable.  It's snappy.  But out of the first story, why'd she jump? 
[01:10:00]  Was there a fire?  You hit the sky.  You hit your head like that, your neck, you're done.  Yeah, I got it, but higher hopes for that one.  I didn't hear that at all.  Oh, shit.  They were probably drunk.  It says that the one thing that remains unclear as probably a pretty important part of the  story is we don't know why they chose to go out the window.  And the other girl looks like she has a huge forehead.  She should have survived.  Wow.  How do you get a forehead that big?  That's a big one. 
[01:10:30]  Without being, you know.  Well, she has her hair back, too, pulled back like that.  Yeah.  That's a wacky look when girls do that.  Iraq, do you have that bomb?  Two seconds ago.  I know.  What are you doing?  He's re-listening from 6 a.m.  We'll get it an hour and 20 minutes from now.  He's going to listen in real time.  He's got it?  Okay, he's got it.  It's not a real time joke.  I was happy.  First story?  Why'd she jump?  Was there a fire? 
[01:11:00]  You hit the sky.  You hit your head like that, your neck, you're done.  Yeah, I got it.  This is the pie truck.  Did you say, was the pie truck outside?  Was there a fucking pie truck outside?  That's funny.  First of all.  We were focused on the picture, though.  There's no such thing as a pie truck.  Where have you seen pie trucks?  Well, that was the joke.  A pie truck is a fat pig saw a pie truck and went for a pie.  I like the line.  And died.  She died getting a pie.  What a great headline.  I like it.  But we were busy focusing on the picture. 
[01:11:30]  Okay.  Good for him.  We're going to take a break.  Yeah.  Jimmy, you got anything?  You got your tickets on sale for the DC show?  Yes, I do.  The 13th of...  Next Friday?  Shit, that is next Friday.  No, next Saturday.  Excuse me.  No, it's Friday.  Friday.  I'll be with Dave and Jim and Bill in DC.  And then June 15th, we open the Chicago Comedy Festival, the Antisocial Network.  Nice.  Yeah, I'm very happy.  All right, good.  Sirius XM, the virus.  Yeah, this is the O.P. Danthony Show.  Damn it. 
[01:12:00]  There's excitement outside.  The building.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Everything is locked down for a mama's visit.  Lockdown mode because...  I don't think you're going to be able to get on that street.  It's going to drive you fucking nuts. 
[01:12:30]  I don't think you're getting out of that parking lot.  I will lose my fucking mind if I can't get my truck out of that garage.  I don't think you're going to be able to.  And I'm not even trying to fuck with you.  I'm thinking Kenny should get the car out now for you.  Well, he doesn't land, but then put it where?  They shut...  The barricades are up.  I know.  And then they'd lock things down not right at 1030 when he lands.  They locked that down beforehand. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  Great.  I'll take the fucking railroad.  I'm not even kidding.  I don't think he's going to get his car out until after Obama moves past that spot.  Then again, why would his car be...  If it's the firehouse I'm thinking of, it's on A...  Oh, for his driving route, my thing.  For his drive back.  No, the barricade's already up on the road, you know, that road.  How the fuck am I going to get home, then?  Exactly.  You're not getting home, either.  How the fuck am I going to get home?  You're not getting home.  Hey, we got Bobo on the line. 
[01:13:30]  Okay, good.  I missed him.  What the hell's he doing?  How the fuck am I going to get home?  That's the important thing.  Bobo.  Yeah, I got two pieces that I figured were the most portable of the one-man band.  We have no idea.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  We have no idea what you're doing.  I have no idea what the fuck you're talking about.  I don't think about you after I talk to you on the phone.  I have no idea why you're even calling.  I do.  So set it up.  Yeah, explain.  What are you calling for?  I brought a kazoo and an air horn. 
[01:14:00]  I'm on a bus on my way to location.  I'm not going to say where I'm going, but I'm about to do a kazoo solo with the air horn.  Bobo, where's the bus going?  You're not part of national security.  Who gives a fuck where you're going?  Are you really on a bus?  Yeah.  I'm on a bus going to the other end of Queens.  The other end of Queens.  Okay.  And how many people are on the bus?  Let me see.  There's about 12 to 13. 
[01:14:30]  About 12 to 13.  Somewhere between those.  About 12 to 13.  One truncated explosion victim.  Of course, you're not sure if you're a whole person, so I understand your math.  No, I'm saying that's minus myself.  Minus yourself.  Right.  So include yourself.  How many people on the bus?  That would be about 16.  So it's 12 to 13 until you're included and it's 16?  And then it's 16. 
[01:15:00]  Well, there was someone who just got on the bus.  Oh.  Oh, someone.  And no one got off?  All right.  All right.  And now, if you don't include the bus driver, how many people are on the bus?  That would be 15.  But you're counting the bus driver, right?  Yeah.  I'm counting the bus driver.  Okay.  And you want to do the Bobo one-man band thing?  Yeah.  Which has been very successful, I'll be honest with you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got a...  Just when we were about to kick you to the curb, you come up with this one-man band thing, 
[01:15:30]  or I think we might have even came up with that, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So.  All right.  So you got some people on the bus.  What are they doing?  Are they being quiet?  Are they just reading the newspapers?  What's going on?  Yeah.  I see a few newspapers.  I see a few iPods here.  All right.  And what are you going to play?  I'm going to play, since it's one more day to the weekend, to Friday, to the beginning 
[01:16:00]  of the weekend, I'll figure I play working for the weekend.  Working for the week.  How do we prove you're on a bus?  Let's see.  Do you hear anything like the sound of a bus?  Do you hear anything?  Do you hear anything like the sound of a bus?  If we heard that, we wouldn't have asked that question.  Kazoos are normally what I hear on a bus and air horns.  Yeah.  Just don't blast it in someone's ear.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Please. 
[01:16:30]  All right.  That guy just got frightened.  Hello?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where's the one man band?  The one man band.  And since the president is aggravating the whole borough of Manhattan. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, hail to the chief, I think that is right there.  Right.  What?  Now this guy, this guy is already trying to, trying to, trying to thread the trophy off  the bus already.  Well, you better, you better keep going with the band. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Please.  Keep it going.  Stop aggravating Manhattan, Mr. President.  Stop aggravating Manhattan, Mr. President today.  Stop aggravating and inconveniencing commuters. 
[01:18:00]  Stop inconveniencing the commuters, Mr. President.  You're causing a lot of taxpayers' money by aggravating commuters.  Stop aggravating.  Stop aggravating. 
[01:18:30]  Stop aggravating.  All right.  We have a black president right now.  Right now.  Right now.  It's a big, big, big.  What are they saying?  Ladies and gentlemen, that was the Daniel Bobo Curl with one man band.  And you guys have just been heard live on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Oh, great.  Thanks for fucking.  Good, good.  Good one.  Yeah, but I think you need a big finish there, Bobo.  Yeah.  Oh, like, what should I call it?  You should be marching up and down the aisle as you do this. 
[01:19:00]  It's obvious that you're kind of hiding in the back.  Stay on the street.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  All right.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  All right.  Ah.  All right.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Oh, my. 
[01:19:30]  Ah.  Oh, my God.  Is that annoying?  Oh.  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you Q-60.  You've been a great audience.  Q-60.  Q-60. 
[01:20:00]  Are you on the bus?  Yeah, I'm on the bus.  What are they saying to you?  Oh, no, they're loving it.  All right, I think some of this has just gotten filled.  I see a guy here with a camera.  Wait, what did that woman say?  Let's talk to her.  Oh, no, hold on.  The radio show that asked me to do this for a walk and see.  No.  Ma'am.  I'm not a part of stupidity. 
[01:20:30]  She's not a part of stupidity.  Yeah, that's what she said.  But she's loving it, you said?  Well, she ain't, but the rest of the bus needs to be enjoying this one.  Should we have them do one more song before we move on?  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  Well, you have one more song, like one over-the-top, good song for the people?  You want to sing your dick song?  I love your dick song.  Yeah, yeah.  Did he just call from the bus randomly?  Yeah.  Yes.  Dude, you just called from the bus and decided to do this? 
[01:21:00]  Yep.  Jesus Christ.  I just saw where's a good place to do this, and this is where I decided to do it.  All right.  That's insane.  You want to wrap up with your dick song?  I think they need to hear the big hit.  All right.  You didn't sing the song, though. 
[01:21:30]  You're scared to sing the dick song?  Well, on this bus, I might get it thrown out, but that's the instrumental version.  Yeah, we know that.  Yeah, we know the instrumental.  I'm very familiar with it.  All right, then maybe God Bless America, and then we can move on.  Yeah, because this can only, the longer we do this, it's going to go wrong. 
[01:22:00]  Of course.  This is going to be the one we look back on and go, why didn't we cut it after nine songs?  That horn is so bad.  You're just trying to get to work at a quarter to eight in the morning, and this? 
[01:22:30]  You knew he was going with that, right?  Oh, yeah.  It's America! 
[01:23:00]  I guess that's it.  That was it.  He's gone.  Yeah.  They probably threw the phone out the window.  Oh, with him holding it, I hope.  All right, there's Bobo and the one-man man.  That was great.  That's his thing, man.  He's really on a bus?  Yeah, we didn't set that up whatsoever.  What's his gimmick?  That's his gimmick now.  Oh, boy.  He needs pots and pans.  You're right, Chris.  Yeah, yeah, he does need a little more bang, bang, clanging.  Yeah, the air horn's getting old.  There's no percussion.  No air horn. 
[01:23:30]  No, no, no air horn.  Pots and pans would be good, though.  Pots and pans are good, though.  That way someone could grab it and smash him in the face with it, too.  True, true, true, true.  What is he?  He fucking, you know, what's wrong with this guy?  He sent me a Facebook.  I'm apologizing.  I'm sorry.  Stop apologizing.  I'm not mad at you.  I'm sorry.  I just want to be back on the show.  I'm like, stop.  I've never been mad at you.  Stop apologizing.  All right, I'm sorry.  I got you mad for saying you were mad.  Yeah, I didn't even know he wasn't part of the show. 
[01:24:00]  I don't think about him after the show's over.  No.  He was banned yesterday.  For what?  Because he went to Foxwoods, and we found out, he told a fan that if he saw Danny, he was going to punch him in the face.  And then he told the same fan that him and E-Rock were working.  Troy said the same thing.  Well, that's fair.  And then he told E-Rock that he and, and then he told a fan that him and E-Rock were working on a super secret, all Bobo worst of.  Oh, okay.  Oh, really?  So we told him that if he's going to, no. 
[01:24:30]  Both were total fabrications, and we said if you're going to lie about the show, you're going to need to take some time off the show.  So he was banned yesterday and back today.  Well, he's back today because he panicked yesterday and started calling everybody from us to Liam to the morning mashup.  He was ready to cry.  On their office phones.  How does he get those numbers?  That is true.  How does he get those numbers?  He was transferred to the morning mashup office because, I don't know, we thought that maybe they could help him.  Oh, my God.  You guys transferred him over to us? 
[01:25:00]  Over to Nicole and Stanley T., yeah.  But Liam talked to him a while back, and Bobo, whenever anybody calls him, saves the phone numbers.  And so then he just incessantly calls them.  And he has Liam's cell phone number, too.  Does he annoy Liam?  Incessantly calls.  He called Liam easily 13 times yesterday.  Wow.  Did he annoy him?  So much.  Liam hates him?  He kept, Liam kept calling to me and just handing the phone to me and saying, guess who he is, Sam.  Liam.  But Bobo, he earned his way back on the show today.  Maybe. 
[01:25:30]  I know, but, you know.  On a bus.  All right.  Jesus.  What's wrong with him?  We went really long, so we're going to take another break, and then we're going to get Rich Voss in here.  They're watching some documentary in the back.  It looks good.  Oh, yeah?  And Bonnie, they have a little bit of a clip back there.  Oh.  Yeah, the thing is go to the clip.  Things can do very well.  We just watched, like, the first 10 or 15 minutes of it.  It was fantastic.  How much of me was in it?  I don't think any.  I didn't see any Jim Norton.  How about a little more Jim Norton?  Well, I thought you were featured in the Opie and Anthony in-studio portion. 
[01:26:00]  And it said Jim Norton.  Big deal.  I didn't talk a lot.  Jim Norton.  You had some good zingers.  Did I?  Yeah.  Jim Norton.  I looked bald from the back.  I'm really not going bald, but the way my hair is when the light hits my hair, I look  like I have horseshoe baldness.  Because you have the direction your hair grows.  It's like when the light hits it, you see stuff.  All right.  Let's not go into detail.  You have a wonderful, fuzzy, velour-like head.  Every one of my bathrooms at home now, no lighting from above.  There's no one going to be watching you take a dump anyway. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, but just seeing that light fucking shining down, man, it fucking shows you a world of  hurt.  So now my lights are only from the floor.  Oh, like Bela Lugosi type lights?  I will say this.  Based on the documentary footage that I saw, laughs from Jim, Anthony, and Opie.  All right.  Everybody's very well represented.  It's very funny.  Wow.  That means the movie's going to be a hit.  I would think so.  Are we in a movie, actually, finally?  Wow.  Let's be honest. 
[01:27:00]  It wasn't exactly a fucking Kubrick production.  Oh, boy.  Are we in a movie finally?  We've never been in a movie after all these years.  And dumb, stupid, asshole jocks always get their faces in movies.  Oh, in some kind of movie role.  Hacks.  Playing a jock.  Dumb hacks have more movie credits than we do.  We officially don't have a movie credit yet.  You're in a sizzle reel.  Oh, so we're not even in a movie yet, officially.  It's just a sizzle reel right now.  Motherfucker.  Well, we'll see.  We'll see.  Sizzle reel.  Sizzle reel.  That's the big one, yeah.  So Rich Voss joins next.  Hey, did anyone see the rest of that adult baby bullshit? 
[01:27:30]  Yep.  Saw that last night.  All right.  Can we talk about it after the show?  What a fucking complete asshole.  Was there more stuff that, better stuff than what we played yesterday?  No, pretty much the same.  They played the, the stuff we played yesterday was pretty much the bulk of it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  But, yeah, he's, there was abuse.  They didn't touch on that in the little thing, but there was abuse in his childhood.  Of course there was.  Yeah.  Somebody fucked little fatty in his crib. 
[01:28:00]  Like, he reached through.  What was that guy's name?  Uh, Stanley or?  Yes, Stanley.  Chubby Stanley.  I remember him.  Little chubby Stanley Uncle Paul.  Yeah, he had little fat babushka arms.  I would play turkey foot with chubby Stanley.  He would put his little feet through the crib and I would go like, oh, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  And you get those little soft feet nice and wet and then you use them like little hands. 
[01:28:30]  You put them together.  You put those little fat feet together all slippery and wet and you use them.  Oh, God.  You open up the front of your tough skins.  Well, of course.  No baby should be named Stanley, by the way.  Little chubby Stanley.  And that mess, disaster that takes care of him, that plays like the mother role.  With the lunch lady arms.  Is disgusting.  They're both just fucking wastes of life. 
[01:29:00]  Chubby Stanley.  And they're both on disability.  So we're paying for this shit?  Yeah, they're leaching.  So we're paying for his big oversized baby crib?  Why isn't that fucking fat slob working?  Because he can't.  Why?  He's been diagnosed, actually, because of his abuse earlier for having post-traumatic stress.  Oh, so the money he's spending on cribs, we're paying for?  Right.  So, yeah, he gets a check from the government so he can get a baba.  So he can go to Home Depot and build a high chair.  And she feeds him and she's like, come on now, come on. 
[01:29:30]  I heard something about, and this is what I was laughing about yesterday because a lot of people said you never said why you were laughing so hard.  Was there a car seat involved?  Someone wrote and said, you're going to lose your shit when you see that he actually has a car seat.  No, I did not see a car seat.  All right, so I got to fuck with me.  I watched the show.  I didn't watch a car seat.  Hey, he got a great laugh out of me.  I was dying just visualizing that this guy drives around in a giant car seat.  That would be a startled baby car seat. 
[01:30:00]  All right, Rich Voss next.  Stay there.  All right.  My dick, my dick, my tiny little dick.  I've never got a lead because of my tiny little dick.  It goes out with no problems.  All you need to do is show your tits.  My dick, my dick, my tiny little dick.  I've never got a lead because of my tiny little dick.  It goes out with no problems.  All right, I'll just go for the part. 
[01:30:30]  My dick, my dick, my tiny little dick.  I've never got a lead because of my tiny little dick.  It goes out with no problems.  All you need to do is show your tits.  My dick.  All right, that's the song.  That's really good, Bobo.  Yeah, my dick.  I know that.  That's the song.  I got it.  I'm just trying to get it.  Sirius XM. 
[01:31:00]  The virus.  The virus.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  No, not at all.  Not at all.  I don't know.  Six or so.  Yeah, but I don't want to be that guy.  So if they drop a bill, what am I going to do?  Bitch and complain? 
[01:31:30]  They should at least comp a couple of you folks.  Yeah, it's an announcement to every comedy club that hears us.  You shouldn't even need to make this.  Unfortunately, you do.  And I hate to say this, but we don't pay.  I hate to be that guy.  We don't pay.  If I want to go into your fucking comedy club, I don't pay for shit.  I will give a nice big tip to someone at the end of the night.  But yeah, Jimmy's right.  I don't pay.  Anthony doesn't pay.  You know how many times we've mentioned comedy clubs?  I only go to one club, though. 
[01:32:00]  There was one in particular recently.  I went in and I got tickets to see one of the guys.  We had a great time.  And then we're ordering beers and food and stuff.  And then a bill pops on our table.  How much was the bill for?  It was probably, this goes back, it was Joe DeRosa.  So this goes back a few months.  Yeah.  It was probably $150.  So they didn't comp you $150 on a drink?  But they give me the free tickets to see the comedian.  And I don't want to be that guy.  You should say it.  What club was it?  I know we have fun with it on the show, but I'm not a cheap guy.  I really am not. 
[01:32:30]  But it's out of principle.  We give away so much free fucking advertising for comedy clubs.  Yeah, I agree.  And then it's kind of enraging that when you do go in and they don't do the right thing.  And I never say anything to the management or nothing.  I just said this to you guys and you got me riled up.  Caroline would never do that shit.  Never.  I haven't paid for a drink or a fucking chicken wing at Caroline's in probably 12 years.  I slipped that waitress at the Caroline's.  I slip her a C note right from the start. 
[01:33:00]  And the drinks come rolling in.  Yeah.  It's great.  But Caroline's is smart.  They know that a lot of tickets are sold from the show.  Governors doesn't do it.  Fucking Stress Factory.  Vinny has never thrown a bill on my table.  He shouldn't.  He shouldn't charge the customers.  Yeah, exactly.  Not for those shows.  Okay, first of all.  I'm not mentioning the club because I don't want to fuck anyone up right now.  You don't fuck anybody up.  Let's just say they're in...  But it is kind of enraging.  Why are you panicking, boss?  This week, when I'm at Helium this Friday, Saturday, if you come down to Helium, you 
[01:33:30]  won't pay a penny.  Now, when you...  Well, that's the club I'm talking about, Rich.  Well, this week...  See, here's the thing.  It could have been a mistake.  It really is, by the way.  But it could have been a mistake from the late staff.  It's happened a couple times now.  It's not a mistake.  When you went to see DeRozan...  What's their deal there?  When you went to see DeRozan...  Fucking...  What's the other club?  Gotham?  They don't fucking do that shit.  Fucking...  Comedy Cellar doesn't do that shit.  They fucking...  I'll tell you it was a mistake.  ...hand it to a check in Philadelphia.  It was a mistake.  A couple times.  It's not.  It's happened more than once, he said.  A couple times.  It's not a mistake. 
[01:34:00]  They'll do the right thing.  They'll get me seats for the show.  Nice seats.  Right in the middle, in the back.  So it's...  I'm in no one's way.  And if I want to bring six to eight people, yes.  They comp that.  But then, you know, we're ordering beers and stuff, and they fucking drop a fucking bill.  I'll tell you who's great.  Fucking Greg Charles over there.  Caroline's.  Caroline knows what they're doing.  I could call up that night and just go, hey, I'm bringing down like four people, and  boom, great seats, comps everything.  That guy is the shizny. 
[01:34:30]  I'll tell you.  If we mentioned your comedy club on the show, none of us pay.  I'm sure this is some kind of plug-ole thing or whatever.  No, it's not.  It's a courtesy.  It's not a plug-ole.  It's a courtesy.  No, it's a courtesy.  Trust me.  In the end, you're going to get money out of my pocket either way, because I'm not going  to walk out without leaving a really nice tip.  It's the principle of the fucking thing.  If you add up the amount of advertising dollars you would have to pay for these mentions,  you wouldn't be able to afford us.  You would not be able to afford this fucking show to advertise on. 
[01:35:00]  I agree.  That's why I get to play golf.  I wasn't even going to say this, but Jimmy fucking got me all riled up as I was telling  you off air.  Because I know Caroline's doesn't do stuff like that.  I know many of the stress factory don't.  Nope.  Most of them don't.  No.  Well, I mean, you don't want to be the guy like, you know what I do for your fucking club?  So what are we doing here?  Well, here's the deal.  So I just shut up and I pay it.  But here's the trade-off.  Okay, so you pay the bill and then you just avoid having comedians from that club on or  allowing them to plug it. 
[01:35:30]  I'm not saying, but you know what I mean?  Like that's, then the club goes, well, how come we can't get anybody on there?  I don't know.  Cause you don't do the right thing.  It's like, you don't do the right thing.  If you're ordering a thousand dollars with the stuff, that's one thing.  But if you go once every three months and they fucking, and you have $150 with a beard,  they should take care of that.  Steve in North Carolina.  Steve.  Hey, I just want to ask, what makes you think that you shouldn't have to pay?  I've told too many people about your show.  Why doesn't Sirius just come up with me for getting you listeners?  I think it's different.  I mean, if you want to keep it within what we're talking about, then I should go to this 
[01:36:00]  particular comedy club and go, you owe me a lot of money for promoting your fucking place.  And I can tell you the difference, sir.  Or this is a, this is a job.  Like it's, you're just, you're just as a friend going, Hey, I like these guys.  And you're passing along.  This is like a professional thing where we're fucking helping the club actually make money.  And I guess, Hey, look, as a consumer, you're doing the same thing.  So maybe, uh, maybe you have a legit beef, but then don't tell people.  They used to, they used to make me pay for the tickets too. 
[01:36:30]  And I bitched about that.  And then they, uh, they stopped that.  I swear to fucking God.  And that's, that's when I went to the guy.  Like, you know, not to the guy, one of his people.  And I said, what the fuck?  And they apologized, blah, blah, blah.  But they still dropped the fucking bill.  Never be need to be said.  But here's.  I should call him up and, and, and do a little math problem for him and go, look, if you want  to play this game, you know how much money you would have, you would owe Sirius XM for  the mentions you get?  And I'll tell you the difference, sir.  One of the things is it's like a lot of times a comedy club will say, um, Hey, could you 
[01:37:00]  take so-and-so?  It's a favor.  Um, are you still here?  Yeah, I'm still here.  Okay.  Like, and like a lot of times because the club is nice and we just like them as people  and they're good guys or whatever.  Yeah.  Like, you can't say no to Caroline.  It's hard because we like Lewis and Caroline and Andrew and we like them as people.  So like, all right, yeah, we'll do you the favor.  We'll take somebody that we normally wouldn't have taken, which helps put a lot of, Voss or  fucking guys that we know and love are different.  When a club asks you for favors like that, you don't go, okay, but you have to give me free.  You don't even think of it. 
[01:37:30]  You just do it because you like them.  And so when you're down, if you have chicken wings and they throw a bill at you, it's  like, okay, Hey, I'll pay it.  Cause there's no arrangement, but fuck you.  Yeah.  It'll, it'll, uh, Joe in North Carolina says that serious does comp if you recommend someone  for a sub.  I don't know if that's true, but maybe it is.  Here's the deal.  Thank you, Steve.  I'm not sticking up for clubs, but a lot of time, this is, I'm serious.  At that club, the owner's never, he, he doesn't go.  So maybe the manager has no clue. 
[01:38:00]  That happens.  That can, no, don't, I'm serious.  If the owner's not hands on on things, the manager could screw up.  I'm just saying that not to cover my ass.  But they take advantage of the, uh, the relationships we have with you guys.  Like you're in right now to promote helium in Philly.  The fact is because you're on our show right now, there's going to be more people going  to your show this weekend.  Simple as that.  We'd have you in anyway.  Yeah.  And I come in when I'm not plugging to it.  Right, right, right.  It's both ways.  Right, right, right, yeah.  You just happen to be the guy that's in the club this weekend that kind of really frustrates 
[01:38:30]  the fuck out of me.  That shouldn't have happened.  Any club should know.  And then I sound like an asshole.  I get it.  No, you don't.  Because I, well, I'm bigger than everyone else.  No, no.  That's bullshit.  We provide a service for a lot of comedy clubs.  No, I've gone, I've worked clubs.  And guess what?  When you throw a bottle of champagne at us at the end of the year, that's not good enough  either.  Fuck you.  When I worked in, I'm done with this shit.  I worked in Detroit, and I was at this fucking club, and I'm headlining, and I go, I want  some need.  They go, you got to pay.  I go, I'm the fucking entertainment.  I'm not paying.  You know, I've had clubs say, well, we want 20% of your CD sale. 
[01:39:00]  No, you're not giving me alcohol.  Yeah.  I mean, there's clubs around the country that are the biggest scumbags on the football.  What you're saying is right, Rich, but that is not what happened in this club.  No, I know.  It happened multiple times, and I don't work the club, so I don't give a fuck.  It's a thing where the first time a manager shouldn't have, you shouldn't have to tell  a manager that, but if you do, or he charged for the tickets, he should just comp the bill  as a courtesy.  There's no arrangement as a fucking courtesy.  But when it happens time and time again, that's because that's what the owner wants, 
[01:39:30]  or they wouldn't do it, and it's fucking embarrassing.  Yeah, but here's the thing, too.  How does Carolines know?  No one's ever said to Carolines, we get into...  No one's ever had to.  Of course.  And we say no to them sometimes, but, you know, come on.  We say...  And you know this.  But here's the deal, too, with you, you said, I don't work the club.  If it was one of the clubs you worked, would you be saying the same thing?  A hundred percent.  Okay, I'm just...  As a matter of fact, I stopped working a club, Rascals, my home club, because a new owner,  and this is 2001, didn't bonus me right, and Opie called him out on the air. 
[01:40:00]  I was here.  Oh, this is at the Opie.  I was here.  I was here.  I called out that guy for all you guys.  It wasn't affecting me.  I was just amazed that you guys were making shit money.  You know, it's ten years ago for Jimmy.  His career was in a different place, and getting horribly shitty money when you were funny  on our show and promoting the hell out of the club.  And they gave me a hundred dollar bonus for the week.  Then they gave me 500, and I never worked for Rascals again.  I was on the show with you.  It's when we did that fucking Thanksgiving show, Me, You, and Otto, in fucking... 
[01:40:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Yeah, it was...  No, you're talking about the other governors.  No, I'm talking about Rascals.  Me, you, and Otto didn't do a show there.  Fine, but this is not the one I'm talking about.  Okay, but I...  Okay, so you're calling clubs to get extra money for people.  The one you're talking...  Holy shit.  What?  You're losing your mind.  Let Jimmy talk.  All right, all right.  Let's start from the beginning.  You're insisting you are in the show.  No, I don't do Rascals.  I drove by Rascals.  I live by the parkway.  I have tokens.  Panicking, Richard.  I'm a rascal. 
[01:41:00]  I know you're exactly...  Oh, God.  I'm going to be riding a rascal in a couple more years.  I fucking...  I did this show.  Enough about the rascal.  I know, I know.  You weren't on the show.  It's not that...  Not only.  Voss was not on this show.  I headlined it.  It was a different one.  Oh, my God.  I wish I could just hand you cancer and you could eat it.  I never worked for Rascals again.  The show that me and Rich did for Thanksgiving was the new governors.  Not the one Ant's talking about, but the other one way out.  Me and you did it.  They fucked us on the bonus, and I've never worked for them again. 
[01:41:30]  That's 10 years ago, and I have never worked for governors because of that.  But it's new owners there.  I don't care who it is.  They fucked me out of a bonus.  They weren't straight, and I have never worked for that club again.  It's new owners.  The building didn't fuck you.  It was the old owners.  Well, whatever.  It's never been made right.  It was in the building.  It never worked for them again.  Why?  It's new owners.  Because you fucked me one time, I have to take it.  If you fucked me again, then I'm stupid for showing up.  Fuck me once, shame on you.  Fuck me twice, I cum harder.  Dennis?  I was on that show.  Sorry. 
[01:42:00]  When you saw the road.  Otto and me did the show.  Bob Levy's hair was so cold.  Florentine has a deep voice.  Jesus, what are you talking about?  Fucking...  He was freaking out.  He was just...  Voss was like...  It was like he was brain, which normally fires one thought an hour, was just shooting.  It was overloading.  It was like a computer dump.  What are you talking about?  I'm wearing denim, but you weren't in Philly.  I'm doing the club this weekend.  I'll be like swings.  What are you talking about?  But would you be saying it if you were in the club? 
[01:42:30]  No, I just ask you.  My feet don't touch the floor.  I ask you.  You're exaggerating.  I would.  You would go after him.  Of course I'm exaggerating.  I'm a comic.  I'm being funny.  So, Rich, I got to tell you, I will not be seeing you in helium.  So we can still play golf Saturday.  I'm going to actually be down in Philly this weekend.  I'm not going.  I don't feel comfortable there.  I wouldn't either.  I've got to be honest with you.  I don't feel comfortable there.  That's embarrassing for the club.  What were we going to say about Joe DeRosa?  No.  Joe's shoulders?  No.  Oh, by the way, you played a good security...  Doorman?  In his movie?  Yeah, I saw the movie. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, I'm a method actor.  You can say that again, because that's where you're headed.  Right for a fucking doorman's job.  Rich plays a doorman in The Cheat.  Are you saying that you work...  Are you actually playing a door?  Yeah, a doorman.  He plays a doorman.  A doorman.  Yeah, it was unscripted.  I ad-libbed.  You had to come up with more personality for the role.  Yeah, he's playing...  Jim Morrissey.  Jesus, give me a fucking...  I just got here.  You do it to yourself, Rich. 
[01:43:30]  You said 8,000 words already.  I did.  You did, I?  You said more than all of us combined.  Doorman, hole for the letters.  Brat snob.  You really do it to yourself, believe it or not.  Not all the time.  Every time, Rich.  Most of the time.  And I'm your biggest supporter.  You are funny in that.  You are like a complete doorman asshole, which is great.  I would love to hear Bonnie's take on this, because she would know what he just did.  She's seen everything he does.  Because that was a weird one, how he just panics and throws himself into it.  She wanted to write a list of things for me to bring in that I fucked. 
[01:44:00]  Like the other day, I'm going to wrap myself out on this.  She caught this, and I didn't realize it.  I text on Twitter that...  Whoopies?  Now that they killed Ben Laden...  Who's Ben Laden?  Hold on.  I'm sorry.  You can come to Philly Friday and Saturday.  It's safe.  And I didn't realize I spelled it B-E-N.  And she's looking at it before I send it, and she goes, you fucking idiot.  It's B-E-N. 
[01:44:30]  Why would she let you send that?  That's where Bonnie's got to stop being a wife.  And start...  Be the comic, Bonnie.  Let dummy send this.  Oh, my God.  That would have been fantastic.  Sometimes you don't pay attention.  No one has ever not paid attention to that.  Ben Laden.  I bet he wrote Benjamin Laden, too.  We were in bed last night.  Me and Bonnie, I swear to God, we're watching Idol.  And I hear something hit.  Like, she had a newspaper on the floor on the side.  I heard something hit the newspaper, and her hand just came like that. 
[01:45:00]  This bitch picked a burger and threw it.  It had to be the size of a marble, because I heard it across the room.  Get it.  Oh, no.  Are you disgusting?  It might have been her wedding ring.  No.  No, it wouldn't have been that loud.  Touche, my friend.  Touche.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  All right.  What do you think of this, Osama bin Laden? 
[01:45:30]  We're not going to be able to see the death photo, Rich Voss.  I was...  Do you get political?  Are you mad?  I was going to ask Anthony, and here's to me...  We've already discussed it among ourselves.  What's your point on this whole thing?  But, first of all, it doesn't matter, because they could doctor it anyway.  It doesn't, you know, who...  You know...  But, like, I was reading on one of your message boards about...  You just said nothing.  We don't have a message board.  One of those things about another radio host and his conspiracy theorists.  I don't even know who the fuck the guy is. 
[01:46:00]  And I'm watching him, right?  And it's almost sounding like...  And I was going to ask you, do you think it really happened?  Do you think he's dead?  Yeah, 100% think he's dead.  Why do you think 100%?  What makes you think...  You don't think he's dead?  No, but what makes you think it happened then, not five years ago, or didn't happen?  I'm asking, that's all.  What proof, what makes you think?  Because what is the upside of holding back the fact...  If you're the president, what's the upside of holding back that you got Ben Laden? 
[01:46:30]  That you could still...  What's the upside?  Yeah, and if he was killed years ago, it was under Bush's administration.  And the number one thing he wanted was to get that motherfucker.  So why would he get him and then go, well, hide him until the next president comes in  and let him take the fucking...  And then you do have the next president.  Why doesn't he use it closer to the election?  And also, Ben Laden's daughter...  Having his approval rating go up now doesn't mean much when a re-election is still a ways away. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, but what are you getting at, though?  And his daughter said that he was killed.  His daughter said that he was killed.  His daughter was there.  Yeah.  I think he's dead.  She was dogged.  Yeah.  Do you know what happened?  The day before...  I think we just changed your mind.  I don't think you were going to say...  No, I agree.  ...that you think he's dead.  I don't believe anything...  You just heard everything we just said.  I don't believe anything that's going on.  I feel bad for the guys that killed...  What do you call it?  In Philly this weekend.  Gaddafi's grandchildren the day before because they just got put...  No one cares about that.  No one cares about that.  They were like big... 
[01:47:30]  You know, we were headliners.  We killed Gaddafi's fucking kids.  They were headlining for a while.  You know, I don't understand anything or care about anything anymore.  After I saw that movie the other night...  And I'm not real brilliant or technical about shit.  No.  Or anything.  Inside Job.  Did you see Inside Job?  The documentary on the whole meltdown of Wall Street and all that shit.  Oh, no.  I haven't seen that one yet.  After seeing that, how do you believe any...  You know, we'll put Inside Job out.  You watch another documentary that has the opposing point, and then you go,  Oh, well, now I can believe the other point of view. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, called Women Aren't Funny.  No, no.  It's amazing, though, how they could spin and twist things.  But these are pretty...  These facts are facts.  Who did Inside Job?  These facts are facts.  These facts are facts.  You can look them up.  Who did Inside Job?  Exactly.  Who was the director?  Who did it?  Who did the movie?  You know, a guy that does documentaries.  Matt Damon was the narrator, so it was big.  It was a big documentary.  You're a humble narrator.  You're a long-suffering narrator. 
[01:48:30]  You gotta watch this.  I'm just asking, who did Inside Job?  I don't fucking know who the director's name is.  Because there's a lot of movies online that Alex Jones turns people on to that, you know...  Oh, well, this is a great documentary.  Look at...  I don't know who did it.  I know the title, so I went and said...  It was the one they talked about at the Oscars.  There's your info right there.  Inside Job.  I don't need the info.  I saw it.  Was it Bill Tetley?  It was Bill Tetley.  Holy shit.  Directed it.  Where's he been? 
[01:49:00]  Making this movie.  Is that turkey bacon?  Yeah.  It's good.  It's good for you.  Huh?  Turkey bacon?  You feel weird eating a relative?  Oh, shit.  By the way, why don't you put your glasses on and we can talk about it.  This is what I'm fucking...  This is who we have in.  Hold on, big successful entertainer.  What happened to your glasses?  He's missing the left ear fucking... 
[01:49:30]  What's it called?  I think they're actually...  Aren't they called arms?  Yeah.  The left arm is gone.  Why?  Exactly.  What happened to your really nice designer glasses?  You're like 127 hours missing the left arm.  Can I see those?  Watch it.  You can break the other one.  Why would I do that?  Oh, you would.  That's so 10 years ago.  Oh.  I got a monocle.  I don't want to...  What?  You don't get a call back.  Your acting just fell apart.  Your face lit up.  Why were you handing him over?  Because I didn't. 
[01:50:00]  I was going like this to see your reaction.  That's called acting.  You walk off the other person's reaction.  Your hands are ashy and awful.  You have the worst fucking...  I just Twittered a photo of Voss's fingers.  Oh, you did?  Dude, he's got the only fucking...  He's the only ashy white man in America.  Look at his fucking hand.  I know.  They are pretty dry.  They're terrible.  They're terrible?  I'm not doing a dub commercial.  Do you agree?  I'm doing radio and eating a turkey burger at fucking nine in the morning with guys on  their way out.  What the fuck do I care how my hands work? 
[01:50:30]  Look at his cuticles.  Whose hands are those?  You.  Yours.  How do you get that so quick?  You don't even recognize your own hand?  What do you do maintenance with a fucking weed whacker on your cuticle?  It's a giant.  How do you not recognize your own hand?  I like to know how it got up there that quick.  It's weird.  There's not a black dick in it, so why would he recognize it?  You heard what he just said, right?  Jimmy did say, I tweeted a picture of Rich's hand, so that would be your answer.  But then you had to say, how did he get up there so quickly?  Quickly, very quickly, that he. 
[01:51:00]  Do you play this role for us?  Huh?  No, I'm just saying, how is it?  Oh, he's at Twitter.  I thought that was a picture already in the archives.  That's all.  No, because your cuticles, I can't believe how fucking horrible they are.  My cuticles?  Here's the difference.  I can put my hands in my pocket.  What do you do with your face?  Oh, nothing on that one.  It's in the fucking omelet.  No, that would be fine if we were in the fucking Poconos in 1966.  Why, they didn't bonus you either?  Rich, do you agree with Obama? 
[01:51:30]  Oh, wow.  Yeah, they're all cracked.  They're not releasing the Osama pic.  It doesn't matter to me.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, they're all cracked up and stuff.  Really?  No, I'm just saying that in the picture.  Really, crow's nest hair?  You're talking about my fucking cuticles?  I'm saying the picture itself.  No, no, the side of your hand.  Maybe if I can get fucking plugged cuticles, I'll have nicer cuticles.  Maybe take a sit and you know what I mean?  You don't have to jump, Rich.  I'm being cool.  I'm just saying.  Okay, I'm sorry.  Mummy fingers?  Yeah.  Nobody likes your fucking mummy fingers. 
[01:52:00]  Look at you.  Come on, that does look bad.  They're really dry.  Look at that horrible hand.  I just want to know how great your camera is so you can get that fucking close.  I get it on my iPhone.  Huh?  That's my iPhone.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  That's perfect.  Look at you.  You see the one cuticle.  This is some FBI shit right here.  Is that one finger dead?  Yeah, what's happening there?  Go like this.  That thing above his neck is.  Is that your ring?  It looks like a dead finger now.  No, I have a dead toe.  I showed you guys that already. 
[01:52:30]  Your palm, Rich.  That's the inside of one of his palms.  That's his fucking callus, dude.  That gray thing is a callus.  What do you callus stands for?  What do you callus?  That's golf.  I'm golf.  Oh, it's golf.  It's gray.  It's dead.  That I understand.  What are you talking about?  Your hands are awful.  You have a horrible gray callus.  I wouldn't suck your hands for $10 million.  If they came through a hole, you would.  Wait, what's wrong?  Yeah, I do have bad hands.  I'm not.  Hey, listen.  I'm fucking.  I'm an older guy.  That's because there's never been a pen in them.  Oh, shit. 
[01:53:00]  Wow.  What's going on with the pointer finger?  Exactly.  It's all bent and terrible.  There's like, what is that?  What are you talking about?  I was holding it like this.  That's not how it is all the time.  Sometimes, you know, you'll look down and someone will take a picture of you.  It doesn't mean you're fucking going to be up in a tower ringing a bell.  That's how my hand was.  Okay?  You see what I'm saying?  Hands like that you'd be ringing a bell.  Those exactly are Quasimodo fingers.  That's why they're so ashy from the fucking rope burn.  I hate your hands. 
[01:53:30]  You hate my hands?  Does Bonnie comment when you rub her side with those hands?  You don't finger her with those hands, do you?  Finger her or something.  You won't allow her.  Is it rough?  I don't finger her.  What the fuck?  Who has time for that?  Fingering?  Who fingers?  What the fuck?  Am I in high school?  I finger popped her.  You don't put your fingers in while you're licking?  I don't.  I don't.  Put your fingers in.  I don't.  While I'm licking.  You gave up on finger popping?  There's two things I don't do.  While I'm licking.  You eat her ass?  Huh?  She won't let me.  Oh, you won't?  Okay.  Larry has to eat her ass.  I wouldn't eat her ass.  You know. 
[01:54:00]  You don't want to eat your ass?  You don't want to eat your ass?  Huh?  She said no.  Yeah.  Just get in there.  You don't listen.  You take charge.  Show them what they're missing.  All you need to do is taste some old black cock.  Oh, shit.  I don't think you're supposed to ask, though.  What's that?  I don't think you're supposed to ask, you know, can I eat your ass?  You're just supposed to start doing it.  You know?  Yeah.  I think the girl, like, should probably initially go, nah.  But if you just start doing it, then, you know.  Yeah, but you don't know her.  We fight, like, any time, like, she gets mad, like, if we're having sex, and I forget I have 
[01:54:30]  my gum in still, or something.  Like, anything to argue.  You're chewing gum while you're having sex.  Once in a while.  I forget sometimes that it's a neck.  That's great.  Here's the deal.  If you still think, like, I've, there was times where you used to, you know, you'd rub the  clit under the fucking hood or whatever they, you know.  But, yeah, you know, this fucking.  Not anymore?  No.  Fuck. 
[01:55:00]  I don't, I barely can.  And I love her.  I like her.  She's, I'm starting to really like her again.  I love her.  I like her.  You know what I mean?  I love her.  You're really downgrading.  I love her.  I like her.  I tell you later.  I won't kill her.  I mean, I like her.  You know, she's fun and funny, and I really love her.  And we're getting along great.  You just don't get it.  You're not as old as me.  You don't get it.  No, it's not.  It's not bad.  You're not that much older, Rich.  We're not from two different generations removed.  Do you want to have sex?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's just not with her? 
[01:55:30]  No, I don't want to.  I never fucked around.  I've never fucked around.  I'm not saying you did.  Oh, do I want to have it with other people?  Yeah.  Oh.  I just, yeah, well, I guess maybe other genders.  Do you suck her toes?  Huh?  Oh, you got to see her.  My toes are her fucking toes.  She had one toenail that's dead or something.  And they're just like, it's fucking dead.  You know how it's dead?  And it's like fucking, it looks like your grandmother's fucking brown finger.  It's horrible.  He's talking about her snot and her dead toenails. 
[01:56:00]  And all we see is hot body.  Yeah, she's hot.  She's good looking.  God, you're the greatest.  She's up for a hosting job on television.  I am?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Can you write it down?  No, because I forget the name.  Not about me.  It's got three letters.  Way to care about your wife and her projects.  Oh, I hope she gets this.  What are you kidding me?  Health insurance?  But I don't fucking thing.  You know, we had good sex.  Are you sure?  Yeah, I guess.  Well, you did.  You put it in and came, I guess.  She came? 
[01:56:30]  Does she not?  She came twice.  I know.  She comes.  Oh, yeah?  She does?  Okay.  How long do you fuck for?  Until we come?  No, no, but how long can you fuck for?  Until the cows come home.  How long can I fuck for?  It depends.  I can't fuck until they get home.  Someone's got a flash of red light on and off.  You're done here.  When was the last time you had sex?  You fucked 10 minutes?  No.  Yeah, sometimes 10, sometimes 3.  Sometimes I haven't.  It depends.  Do you fuck hard?  I, like I start, like I, here's how I used to, here's what was my old technique. 
[01:57:00]  My old technique, I just put the head of my dick in just to get him going, you know?  Just fuck with the head of your dick.  Now put the other inch in.  The other inch in.  The head in, the balls are hitting the lips.  So, you know, do I fuck hard?  Wait, you know, walk us through that technique?  Yeah, he's teasing.  You just put the head in.  And then what happens?  Then you pull out, then you go down a little, right?  You fucking, you start eating the pussy, you know what I'm saying? 
[01:57:30]  And then, uh.  I mean, what happens?  And then.  Then you ram it home?  You know when you, you know when you're ready to come, okay, then you pull out and go eat pussy  so you can hold back.  Right, right, right, yeah.  All right, everybody says, think about your grandmother, but then I'll really come.  You know what I mean?  Of course.  Yes, I do.  Like, ugh, let me see that come.  Really?  Oh, fucking horrible.  Jesus Christ, I'm over this morning.  That's all right. 
[01:58:00]  You're not bad, but just the way your head went, know what I mean?  You sound like Charlie Callas.  So, you know.  Name that thing on his hand, Charlie.  Listen, Bonnie and I eat something.  He's losing his microphone.  Your bacon's gobbling over there.  We're going to get funny.  Bonnie and I are getting one great.  Even in bed last night, she said, we make a good team.  And then I go, until I heard that booger land on the newspaper.  She's the brains and you're the driver. 
[01:58:30]  It's an excellent team.  We are.  It's fun together.  Do you still have a lot of sex with the baby?  Frickin' retard.  Yeah, we do good.  How long do you...  Are you a long banger?  Can you bang a while before you blow a load?  Oh, yeah.  How long, a half hour?  Two and a half hours.  No, honestly.  I don't know.  I'm probably...  I mean, Rich nailed it.  Like, sometimes shorter than others.  I'm probably a 15...  I mean, sometimes I can't cum, but it's not because I'm a stud.  It's because I fucking lose my erection.  Like, if I fuck too long, I'll lose my heart on. 
[01:59:00]  So, I try to...  I don't understand that.  I've never been able to not.  Did you ever premature?  Sometimes you're...  What?  Never premature, exactly.  Very rare.  I mean, when you were young?  Yeah.  I think every guy.  Really?  No.  You've never prematureed?  Are you kidding me?  So, no.  Fuck, I remember one time...  Well, he said he's younger and all.  Yeah, when I was younger, I remember...  Not younger.  I don't know about younger.  They're maybe 30s.  I was with this girl in Canada.  I picked her up on the street in a cafe.  She was so fucking beautiful. 
[01:59:30]  Beautiful.  We go to my hotel room.  We're making out.  And she stuck her tongue in my ear.  And it got so fucking...  I fucking...  I shot a load all over myself.  Right?  So, I had to go...  For her tongue in your ear?  No.  I just got so excited in my head.  I kept thinking...  This was years ago.  A year ago.  There was no contact on your dick whatsoever?  No.  I had one of those.  Wow.  And I fucking came...  I go out of the bathroom and I went and threw water.  Oh, fuck.  Spilled water on me.  Did she know, though?  Huh?  You got to make believe it.  See, I didn't know when she got kicked out.  You know?  What'd you say?  I can't do this?  I go, I...  It's uncomfortable. 
[02:00:00]  Whatever.  What are your jackets?  I just came in my pants.  Sorry.  Yeah, it's fucking horrible.  I had one of those.  Oh, yeah.  Outside the North Port movie theater.  Just making out.  Wow.  I'll be...  I'll admit it.  Was she rubbing your hand at least?  No.  Rubbing your penis?  No contact.  It was just what the boner was doing in my jeans.  It was rubbing enough.  It was a rager.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  It happened.  One time.  And then I had to make believe it didn't happen because then you're like, you know, she's  going to laugh at me. 
[02:00:30]  Well, I was on...  This...  I don't think this happened, talking about rascals.  Oh, yeah.  It happens.  Well...  It never happened to you, Jimmy?  Younger?  No, because my jerking off was...  When your hormones are just fucking out of control?  My jerking off was so ferocious that I was good at edging.  I always had very, very good orgasm control.  Like, it's one thing I have.  Right.  Sometimes it's really hard for me to come, and then I start panicking like I won't be able  to come so I lose my rod.  Like, that's...  It's this weird panic like I go through.  I fucking mentally kill myself sexually.  I mean, erect a discussion. 
[02:01:00]  I had the one time where I was with a week...  I had a whole weekend with a girl upstate years ago.  I think I was like 16 or 17 or something like that.  And she wouldn't fuck me like the first night, but it was like dry humping and everything,  and I had a rod like the entire night.  The next day, blue balls, everything.  And then the next night, she decides that we're going to be able to fuck.  Like, I could barely even fucking touch her lips, and it fucking just exploded.  But I was so worked up, I never lost the rod, so I was able to just jam it back in. 
[02:01:30]  Really?  Why wouldn't she fuck you the first night?  I don't know.  I think she was just one of those, like, eh, until we, you know...  Until you bought her cookies, right?  No, it was more like until I got the fucking bottle of Southern Comfort out.  I was eating this girl's pussy once.  I'm going down on this girl.  And it stunk so bad.  I had to...  I was going down and I would charge her.  Siding the bed and start drying.  It was so fucking horrible. 
[02:02:00]  Then one other time, I was fucking this broad.  We're going down on her, and I see all this fucking white, drippy goo.  I go, your bitch, is your fucking pussy a glue factory?  What the fuck is coming out of it?  And it was like a yeast infection.  Yeah, it's a little yeast.  Yeast stinks, too.  What's worse than when you're fucking a girl and you pull your dick out,  and it looks like a fucking...  Someone leaked a Boston cream donut on it, and the whole room stinks like fucking bread.  So you have fuck money.  Hey, baker pussy, I'm not happy with this scenario. 
[02:02:30]  You're going to have to blame Iraq for this one.  I just got a note.  What?  Iraq wants to play something for everybody.  Oh, good.  What is it?  Oh, really?  Oh, fucking horrible.  Jesus Christ, I'm over this morning.  That's all right.  That was not bad with the Iraq.  What was wrong with that?  Now get on mic and explain.  Explain that.  What was that?  I just made a note that he mispronounced Jesus Christ.  No, I didn't catch that.  Do we play it again?  Barely.  He's wearing a Pac-Man shirt.  Oh, really?  That was fucking horrible. 
[02:03:00]  Jesus Christ, I'm over this morning.  Jesus Christ.  He sounded a little Irish, but he got it.  A little Irish.  That was the fucking turkey bacon he was eating.  Turkey bacon.  I'm not making any noise.  You have no respect for the show.  You eat and talk at the same time.  Every time you're in here.  Now I don't have any respect for the question.  No respect.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  I'll be eating before it gets cold.  And you can't hear me, too.  I took no gum into my mouth, isn't there?  Because you're eating.  I love this guy.  Nathan Brimmer writes, Rich Voss, a body of a 54-year-old. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, my God.  I picked the wrong fucking day to say what I said.  Uh-oh.  Oh, God.  What?  What happened?  That's the helium broad.  How is that possible?  You're right.  She's very nice.  We like her.  How is that fucking possible?  Good.  That's what you should say.  Perfect.  What?  I just looked up, and I saw the helium broad.  Oh, well.  She's here with the...  How is that fucking possible?  She's here with the Waynes brothers.  Who, Stacy?  I mean, Meredith?  I love Meredith. 
[02:04:00]  But she should know that.  I don't think anyone from Helium's ever been up here.  I bitch and complain about their club, and I look up, and the helium broad is here.  Well, then you know they're not listening, so...  Are you fucking kidding me?  Believe me.  What are the odds of that?  The owner already called her.  Well, he should.  All right.  Well, allegedly, and this is hearsay.  I don't know how true it is.  See?  Okay.  When you called the club that time, you called as Greg, and got your...  They knew as soon as I fucking showed up.  Okay.  Well, that's their explanation. 
[02:04:30]  And you call for me.  I've never called.  Yeah, well...  I don't call them.  That's how they're spinning it.  You called as Greg, and they didn't know me.  The guy knew.  The manager that was working that night...  Gives you a smile.  He knew exactly who I was.  Because he knows that it's me.  They've been coming to see.  So why would he give free tickets to Greg?  But that's...  You know what?  There you go.  Why would he give them to Greg?  Why would he give free tickets to Greg, but give a bar bill and a food bill?  Ah, that's a good point.  Who the fuck is Greg?  Excuse me.  Because I did...  I admitted I got free tickets. 
[02:05:00]  That's a good one.  He's got a point right there.  I told you...  And thank you for the free tickets, by the way.  I should sound, you know, grateful, but...  Oh, you do.  You're right, though.  I don't know.  I agree.  I wasn't going to say anything.  I followed Jimmy on this one.  I pushed him for this one because I agreed.  I was telling Jimmy off air.  And Jimmy's basically saying that's bullshit.  Yeah, I agree.  And then I was like, you know what?  You're right, Jimmy.  And then, of all days, the helium broad's here.  Are you kidding me?  Hey, did I see the guy from Saved by the Bell walk by? 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  Slater.  Mario Lopez.  Yeah, Mario Lopez.  Wasn't he supposed to do our show?  We said yes to him.  I thought so at one point, but I don't know what happened.  We're the Waynes brothers.  I want to meet them, too.  So, anyway, Nathan...  What year is this?  I like the helium broad.  She's actually been very nice to me because there was another issue that she took...  Ah, whatever.  It's not about her.  Nathan Brimmer writes, Rich Voss, body of a 54-year-old, hands of an 80-year-old, and a brain  of a 6-year-old.  Oh.  Whoa.  He got me. 
[02:06:00]  I know.  He actually talked you up on the brains department.  Whoa.  Aren't you doing a benefit, too, Rich?  Oh, tonight we're doing a benefit for cops.  It's me, Bonnie, and Bobby Kelby.  We should be promoting that.  That's a good thing.  Yeah, and Union at the Union High School Theater.  It's like some theater at Union High School in Jersey.  Union High School Theater.  It's like some theater at Union High School.  Yeah.  There you go.  Theater, theater.  How many theaters?  I'm going to come together.  Don't get me wrong.  I got you.  I don't fail.  No, you don't.  You know, I'm one of those fucking polls. 
[02:06:30]  I don't fail.  It's me, Bonnie, and Bobby.  It's for the Union PBA.  I love doing these cop things, man.  I like doing them.  We did one in Manville once.  They're fine, man.  They get it.  Yeah, it's fucking fine.  Great crowds.  How come no women live in that town?  Something like I said, Manville.  Holy shit.  Cops are a good crowd, though, huh?  They're fun.  They're fun.  Yeah, they like having a good time.  Unless you're robbing a bank, then that's not a good crowd. 
[02:07:00]  I never heard this new laugh that Chip is...  I think Chip's tired of bombing, so he's trying to...  He's trying to laugh and lead people.  Yeah, yeah.  It ain't working.  Oh, shit.  Fucking cop benefit.  And helium.  And if...  You come to helium this weekend.  Is the club floating over the city or something?  I was talking.  Why is it helium?  We're here with balloons or something.  I wish people could see the way his mouth looks when he does that laugh. 
[02:07:30]  There's like spittle on your lips when you do it.  Where are you going to be, Rich?  Union High School Theater tonight.  Me, Bonnie, and Bobby Kelly.  It's going to be fun.  And then over the weekend at that place.  At helium.  At helium.  And if you're a radio host, from now on, you will get in for free. 
[02:08:00]  You will eat for free.  Oh, well, now it's uncomfortable.  For real.  Maybe.  Now it's uncomfortable.  I know.  It's got to be like a comic on a boat that bombs on the way down to the cruise.  No, I can't even show up there.  Now it's uncomfortable.  Hey, when you were on your boat...  What boat?  When you went on your cruise?  Yeah.  Was there a comic?  Did you listen?  There was like an improv thing.  Nice.  I didn't even look.  And then anybody that would say something like, hey, have you seen the improv thing? 
[02:08:30]  They're really good.  But I instantly knew that they were dumb, stupid people.  Boat comics are the worst.  My friend gulloped in a boat.  And on the way down, he bombed so bad.  So he was sitting on the deck next to some old people.  And they go, this is a great cruise.  We're having a good time.  And the old people go, we heard the comic sucks.  He said, yeah, I heard the same thing.  It got back to the old people.  Yeah, if a comic isn't doing good, they drop. 
[02:09:00]  They drop him off at one of the ports and let him fly home and pick up another comic.  It's fucked up.  That's horrible.  I know.  It's like, hey, you can do good Costa Rica for you, motherfucker.  Fly home yourself.  I don't think if he's doing bad.  I think if he's offensive or pisses people.  I don't know.  I think if people don't like him either.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah, because the whole thing is making the people happy, you know?  So if the comic ain't doing it, get the fuck off the boat.  Because they want to make sure everyone's having a good experience.  HMS Bounty. 
[02:09:30]  You just pop him in a little fucking rowboat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If it's Bounty, it's going to be like the quicker picker-upper.  They pick you up and get you the heck out of here.  What are you eating?  When we get back.  Nothing.  Oh.  We're on break.  I don't eat.  What do we got?  A man beat, tattooed, and tased in his genitals.  Oh, God. 
[02:10:00]  This is a great story.  We'll do this one next.  Stay there.  The virus.  Virus.  Call the opening day show now.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  Send your feedback to feedback at opianthony.com.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Rich Voss in studio.  What's going on?  Yeah.  Why are you looking at me weird today?  I don't have a good... 
[02:10:30]  From the whole...  I don't have a good vibe for you guys.  Oh, shut up.  Am I...  You have done nothing wrong.  I ate.  Huh?  I got scolded for eating.  No, I didn't.  That was a joke.  I mean, I so don't care.  Get a picture?  Just try and do radio.  Who did you get a picture with?  But I can't.  Why you got Jimmy's mic?  Sorry.  Sorry.  I didn't...  There was no names on him.  I just love Voss.  No, I'm just constipated today. 
[02:11:00]  That's why the look...  I don't know.  I just...  I look over you, looking at me like fucking, you know...  And I'm squinting.  Because I start wearing glasses and it's fucking...  Yeah, what the fuck's wrong with your eyes?  It's fucking on my eyes.  Four eyes.  I was four eyes.  Four eyes.  I went to a stupid eye doctor.  They said you need glasses for driving and maybe watching a little TV if the TV's a little  too far away or movies.  So ever since I started wearing these things, I think it fucked up my eyes.  So, boy, of course.  It's like bringing a car in.  Look, I don't need it.  I don't need it for my iPad.  I don't need it for my tiny little phones.  Oh.  But now my eyes feel all fucked up because I started wearing these glasses. 
[02:11:30]  That's perfect for you.  You went to an eye doctor or an optometrist.  Damn.  What the fuck?  These are better than the ones I had to buy.  How much were these?  Four bucks?  I got insurance, buddy.  Oh, these are actual...  Is that better?  What a creep you look like with those square glasses.  I know.  I love it.  Oh.  Do they work?  I don't need glasses for everything close.  Let me see what I'm doing.  Because I'm the opposite of people that are getting older like myself. 
[02:12:00]  You're supposed to get to a point where you need reading glasses.  I don't need reading glasses because I have the LASIK, but I need it for far away.  Shit.  Did he tell you that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They said up close, I'm perfect still.  Hey, look.  I could see the stars like 10 million miles from here.  So my eyes are like, I'm kind of squinting at everything.  That's the look you got because I feel like I have a headache or something. 
[02:12:30]  Do you have to get glasses?  Can you get LASIK again?  That's what I'm hoping for because this glasses thing is not working.  Why?  Is there a law or...  Well, I was thinking more health-related, but what are all the legalities?  No, I understood what he said.  When you get older, the LASIK doesn't help at all.  Now, you're in your 40s.  I'm starting to see where like a little bit...  For me, it works, but like a little bit at night, I'm going to have to get night driving glasses.  That's why I got to, but then if you're in your house, let's say watching TV or I'm playing a lot of Tiger Woods golf right now, but then I want to check my Twitter or look down. 
[02:13:00]  It's fucking driving my brain crazy because it's so blurry in front because it's made to see far.  So how do I figure that out?  Bifocals.  I ain't fucking bifocals.  Bifocals.  Why not?  They have a squint and have this weird look on my face that Rich picked up on.  What's wrong with focals?  They like sex with both genders.  Oh, no, you didn't.  Yes, I did.  Oh.  Yes, I did.  This dummy just asked, what about contacts? 
[02:13:30]  It would be the same problem.  No.  But it would just be contacts.  It would be far away.  No, he might just say context.  He's just...  No, I shouldn't.  But then when I looked down, it would be blurry.  That's the problem I have now, but at least with glasses, I could quickly take them off.  Oh.  I didn't mind that.  And I wasn't going to bring it up on the show, but that's why probably the look.  Because seriously, it's like bothering me.  Yeah, that's...  I got to get rid of these glasses, I think.  It's not working.  It's dark glasses.  How do people handle that? 
[02:14:00]  I think it's a unique situation because I have the LASIK.  Yeah.  Because you're having a tough time.  Oh, close-up shit.  It's crazy now.  Now I'm like this.  And I should be that guy, but...  And I got to squint, and I just got to hope I can make the word out just by the length of it.  Oh, yeah.  Like, you kind of recognize the words after years of seeing it.  You're like, okay, it's a seven-letter word that starts with H.  It's terrible.  Let me figure this out.  But I should be that guy, too, Bob, because I have the LASIK.  I'm not that guy.  Yeah. 
[02:14:30]  But now my eyes went bad as far as seen far.  Far, I'm fine with.  That's fine.  That's usually how it works.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I got to go back.  I'm lucky Bonnie reads to me.  No laughs there because we really believe that.  That's why no laughs.  Just so you know.  Should be a good line, but we actually believe that as a fact.  Where did Jimmy go?  Did he get a pic?  Oh, is he going to get a picture?  He's with Mario Lopez.  Mario Lopez.  Well, why doesn't he do our show? 
[02:15:00]  What the hell could we talk to him about, quite honestly?  I think he's promoting some kind of ab exercise book or machine.  Oh, God.  And I've had it with dumb people.  Boardroom Jimmy, and I know you're a regular.  You're getting old.  Suck it up and get reading glasses.  That's the complete opposite of what I just told you.  He said from far away.  You are listening, dummy.  You don't listen.  I just said, I got an iPad in front of me.  It is crystal clear.  I got my stupid Atrix phone.  Crystal fucking clear.  I can read tweets without moving the phone away.  What's an Atrix?  But it's blurry down the hall. 
[02:15:30]  Far away, Vision.  You know what?  Know what's fucked you up over all of this?  That glass isn't clean.  So the glass out of the studio is fucking us up.  You know what?  We need a prescription studio so they can just grind the glass down.  You ought to do all of this because of dirty glass.  The doctors.  You know what?  But with this weird face I got because I'm kind of having a half squint. 
[02:16:00]  I'm made for a monocle.  You want a monocle?  I already got the look.  A monocle.  See, I could fucking hold a monocle in there, how I'm looking.  A monocle.  Enough about this bullshit.  That is the dumbest thing ever.  It's not interesting for anybody.  It's not true.  There's a lot of people out there that have eyes.  Yeah.  But Lon's got one.  Oh, yes he does.  See?  It was shot out.  But we'll never know.  We'll know eventually.  So you just said.  We'll never know. 
[02:16:30]  I'm just saying.  I'm just asking questions.  So you're skeptical.  No, we'll never know what he looks like.  I want to see what he looks like.  Dad, I'd probably be good to say.  His brain's fucking spilling out of his head.  Why are you rolling?  Well, Howard took him before.  Yeah, we know he went on Howard, so he could do us.  I know, but I know.  He doesn't want to do us.  Did you tell him I was in the studio?  That's right.  Oh.  What a handsome guy.  I just got a picture with him.  It's fucking depressing.  Eh.  Fuck him.  I'm not a fan.  I just wanted a photo.  No, I mean, fuck him. 
[02:17:00]  I'd love to.  He's the type that you'd actually kiss his cheeks.  I'm liking that movie.  Oh, no.  Rich just blurted things out sometimes.  I know.  What movie, Rich?  You know, the one Florentine talks about when a guy's ass is so great, where he's running  down the street.  Oh, 10 to Midnight Warren.  He did have a great ass, that guy.  Oh, 10 to Midnight.  Me and Jimmy, so we're talking about how great the guy's cheeks were.  He's just for jerking off.  Yeah, let's just for jerking off.  I finally figured out what happens when Rich comes in here.  You do great radio for us. 
[02:17:30]  Don't ever question that.  But we just sit around and wait for you to just say something stupid.  Exactly.  You know what I mean?  There's like this weird thing that happens.  Well, but here's the problem.  Because I kind of want to move on to the tattooed genital guy, but I just know you're going  to say something ridiculous.  I read that story.  I read that story.  Okay.  And?  Oh, and?  Oh, it's a great story, except for the guy.  Here's the thing.  I mean, you guys will pick apart every little thing, so you make it look like, did I make  some mistakes?  Big deal.  Everybody makes a mistake every now and then. 
[02:18:00]  Of course.  And again.  So, you know, I mean.  What the fuck?  I'm looking at the stealth helicopter thing that our own media won't not show.  Oh, yeah.  Like, we have no respect for the military fucking.  Yeah.  What is it?  How about every network that pretends they care about, like, soldiers in the military just  doesn't show the top secret helicopter parts?  Yeah.  Like, it's not, you know, why do you have to show it?  It's not like you want to.  And what do they, how do they blow those things up?  That they obviously can't blow up the whole thing. 
[02:18:30]  So, they go for the control panels or whatever?  I was just, I have no idea.  I guess they have a demo guy that goes in there and does it.  You've never seen Mission Accomplished?  It's not like old school grenades or something throwing them in.  Oh, so one of those guys was there just in case that he's got to blow some shit up?  They have contingency plans for everything.  What did he say now?  See, this is what I'm talking about.  Go right back.  Hold on.  But this is exactly what I'm talking about.  That's why we can't ever really do material because we just got away from the fuck off.  This is why.  Because I really want a real answer to this.  I'm curious.  Rich Voss is honestly the greatest person that comes in here. 
[02:19:00]  He's my favorite.  Yes.  Do you have it?  It's coming.  Okay.  We were just talking about the helicopters.  Yeah, yeah.  Rich did a movie reference.  Did you hear it?  Oh, no, I didn't.  Oh, yeah.  I was involved in the conversation and I missed that bit of greatness.  Talk to Iroch.  Iroch's playing Ecstasy again.  Iroch's going crazy.  He'll get it.  Does he really have a Pac-Man shirt on?  Yes.  Yeah.  That's how he eats.  Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble.  Yeah, of course.  Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble. 
[02:19:30]  It's an awful shirt.  Pac-Man.  He's getting mad.  Pac-Man's eating what he wants to eat.  Go on chip.  You know where I was going?  I couldn't put it together.  It was more of a fill in your ending.  Do we do this?  Hold on.  Oh, he's got it.  Yeah, but hold on.  Hold on.  Okay.  Do we do this today?  It's just waiting to happen.  Oh, it really is.  It's just waiting to happen.  Do we do this?  Yeah. 
[02:20:00]  I remember the author bit.  Can we do this?  They've had to.  All right.  What are we doing first, Jimmy?  Richie's great movie reference.  It was very funny.  Oh, okay.  Let's hear it.  Demo guy that goes in there and does it.  You've never seen Mission Accomplished?  It's not like old school grenades or something.  Oh, Mission Accomplished.  You've never seen Mission Accomplished?  Mission Accomplished?  I read it.  Mission Accomplished.  Mission Accomplished.  It was a B movie.  Oh, shit.  Wait, what was that Gacy movie you're talking about? 
[02:20:30]  That I actually want to see.  Dear Mr. Gacy.  Who was in that?  William Forsythe.  Who?  William Forsythe.  Forsythe?  You know the guy that was in the Forsythe?  Who was in the Steven Seagal movie?  I'm sure he can see a lot of things.  He fucking got me outside with that one.  He was telling me about it.  Steven Hindsight?  He said the name, and I guess my eye's wet. 
[02:21:00]  He goes, did I get it wrong?  I'm like, no, no, that's exactly it.  I just couldn't wait to get him here.  Wow.  Forsythe.  You'll feel very distraught.  Mission Accomplished.  Mission Accomplished.  It's a very short movie.  It starts by them just announcing that they've done what they're supposed to do.  Oh, how did I fuck that one up?  I don't know.  That is a good one.  You're like a clockwork apple. 
[02:21:30]  I'm sure they were pretty bummed when that fucking cop didn't take back off.  They're like, oh shit, we got this secret helicopter thing here, and now we got to destroy it.  No, you know, you can still use it for other things, and maybe that's why it wasn't that loud.  You can probably hear it, but maybe it wasn't that loud when they came in.  Well, that's probably, they were saying that's probably how they got into Pakistan, so easily without being detected and shit.  A quiet, stealthy helicopter.  Damn.  That's awesome.  And then, you know, you got it, and then it's like, oh great, we used it this one time, and now we got to blow it up. 
[02:22:00]  Whoops.  Did you see them all in the situation room?  Yeah.  No, we haven't seen any of this stuff yet.  Obama looking very diligently at the screen.  Yeah.  It's a good picture.  Did a good job.  It's a good picture.  Commander and Chief did a good job.  Why is it a good picture?  They were really watching me on Joey Behar.  I was going to tweet that, but I...  Who's Joey Behar?  Joey.  Joey Behar.  Oh my God, no, did you see? 
[02:22:30]  We're explaining why there was no smiles.  Wow, how did I say mission accomplished?  I meant impossible.  Mission accomplished.  It's okay, Rich.  It happens.  Don't beat yourself up.  I get anxiety when I come here.  Why?  I don't fucking know.  Now I'm going to have to take a Klonopin.  I get in the car.  It's early.  I don't sleep.  I slept three fucking hours.  Okay, I sleep three hours.  I'm watching it later last night.  One girl is fucking so hot.  I'm going to Bonnie.  She has a great voice.  But the whole time, I'm thinking, God, she's fucking hot. 
[02:23:00]  And I get three hours sleep.  Then I come in.  I'm all disorientated and disoriented.  Disoriented.  Okay, I was waiting for a disorientated.  And I get anxiety.  And then I go take a Klonopin.  Or half of one.  I never take one.  And what does that do for you?  Huh?  What does that do for you?  Relax.  It kind of relaxes you out?  Yeah, I take it maybe once every two months.  Once a month.  Is that it?  Yeah.  What?  It's for nerves and anxiety.  Is that bad? 
[02:23:30]  No.  Not in meditation.  Huh?  When I try meditation?  It's not addictive or anything?  What am I fucking Gandhi?  Huh?  I think it is addictive.  Yes, of course it is.  A lot of people are on the Klonis.  No, I don't think.  Well, anything's addictive.  Anything is.  Addiction's mental.  Is it physically addictive?  I don't think so.  If you take it.  It is.  If you take it.  No, I'm telling you.  You're not a doctor.  It's addicting.  No, I'm not a doctor.  My mom was on Klonopin.  She's been on all this shit.  That's one of the ones that is highly addicting. 
[02:24:00]  Good stuff, man.  Addictive?  Highly addictive?  Addictive, yeah.  Yeah.  Once in a while.  Yeah?  Does it calm you down?  I was on a fucking plane.  I'm not bullshitting.  When I was flying to...  BSing.  Last week to Vegas.  You know how you...  You do realize we can't curse as much.  Oh, I'm sorry.  So, Jimmy's right.  A little bit, but they give us a bunch of stuff because of the FCC.  Whatever.  Oh, okay.  So, I'm on a plane.  You know how, if you're not first class, right?  No, I don't.  The one seat. 
[02:24:30]  The one seat that's out front, that sits right there, and there's no seat in front of you.  This guy keeps going to the bathroom on the plane.  He's a big dude, and he's got a pouch.  He's got a...  And he keeps walking back, and he's looking all...  I'm getting all paranoid.  Then he...  Now, he's standing looking at the door.  So, I got my seat back.  So, I think...  He's big.  I think he's just going to run and pull up the hatch of the door.  And I don't know if that can be done.  So, before you attack me...  Huh?  No.  Why not?  Not in flight. 
[02:25:00]  Because of the air...  Pressurized, yeah.  Oh.  I'm sure there are other safety devices that kind of don't allow you to open that fucking  thing up.  The store just doesn't...  When they land, no problem.  No problem.  This guy was twice the same.  The plane has been, you know, depressurized at that point.  That's what I thought.  I'm not really...  I don't know a lot about pressure.  Yeah.  No kidding.  Exactly.  The one advantage to your career.  No expectations.  Why didn't you walk into that?  Someone's saying Kalani's are not addictive. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, okay.  They're not.  I am.  Someone's saying it is.  Hold on.  Let's have these two.  Kalanipan.  Yeah, don't we have a doctor...  Say the rest of your story.  I think Dr. Steve...  You need to be careful with it because a lot of times you'll start...  We're going to have a debate here.  We got Avi who thinks Kalani's are highly addictive.  And we got Jeff and Buffalo saying they're not addictive.  And we'll start with Avi.  Avi, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  I love you guys.  You're the best.  Of course.  Thank you.  Kalanipan is highly addictive.  It's a benzodiazepine. 
[02:26:00]  It falls in the same category as Xanax and Valium.  And with Rich's history of taking narcotics, which it is, he's not taking that by half  one every two months.  First of all...  Oh, shit.  He's calling you a liar.  No, listen to me.  Before you...  He's calling you a liar.  Don't speculate and talk bullshit that you have no idea.  Rich.  Okay.  No, don't tell me what I'm taking.  Hold on.  Hold on, Rich.  What?  It's a real thing.  You can't curse much anymore.  Oh, okay.  Don't tell me...  Say BS. 
[02:26:30]  Okay.  Here's the deal.  The doctor prescribed...  What is it?  One milligram?  Give me your curse again.  I'm really going to get you in trouble.  Okay.  I won't do it again.  I'm sorry.  I know when I've been to many doctors for dental pain, for whatever, I know where my limit is  and I stay way below it.  Okay?  I'm allowed to take two a day if I want.  I might take one a month.  All right?  So don't go running at the mouth going, because of my history. 
[02:27:00]  All right?  I know my history.  That's why I do completely...  Well, you said you take a half, one every two months.  Oh, whatever.  Okay.  You know what?  I said, don't try to break it down and be all technical.  I know what I'm doing.  I know about addiction, pal.  So do not preach to me.  Knowledge is no defense.  Do not preach to me about addiction.  Knowledge is no defense.  Do not preach to me about it.  Okay?  I was...  Rich takes the sobriety very seriously, sir.  All right.  Knowledge is no defense.  It's a slippery slope.  What's that?  It's a slippery slope.  It has nothing to do with them.  It does.  I knew that was coming. 
[02:27:30]  But it is.  Yes.  Any of us, you know...  Yes, of course.  I got a disease that tells me I don't got a disease.  You know what?  It's so funny.  When you go into certain...  I don't want to bring any anonymity or tradition.  When you go into a 12-step...  Here's the deal.  They're not doctors.  Why do you guys say it that way?  I got to ask a question.  What?  You guys always say it that way, but everyone knows it's the big one.  I'll tell you why.  It's out of respect for the tradition.  They request anonymity at the level of press radio film because they don't want any individual 
[02:28:00]  associated with them.  Fair enough.  It's respectful with their wishes.  But I think it's obvious to most people when you guys say that.  It is, but there are other ways, too.  I mean, there's a few ways to do it.  I always wanted that.  That's all.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, there's a lot of people or celebrities.  Hey, I'm going to this and that.  And the next thing you know, they're drinking and other people go see.  It doesn't work.  Okay.  Jeff in Buffalo, go ahead.  But he agrees with Ridge Voss and the Kalanis are not addictive.  Jeff?  Well, I think it depends on the person.  I've been on it for about five years now.  Exactly.  Thanks, Jeff.  Thanks for the call. 
[02:28:30]  I've been on it for five years.  Why have you been on it for five years if it's not addictive?  For a tick disorder, it helps calm me down.  It helps me get rid of ticks.  So, I mean, I can go a couple days without taking it at all, without any problems at all.  Yeah.  So it's regulatory.  Rich, is this the photo you're talking about?  Yeah, it's great.  What is Hillary thinking right now?  He's up with her.  Yeah, she's probably looking at the dress with a load on it. 
[02:29:00]  You had an answer?  Oh, God.  We got Dr. Steve.  Thank you.  Klonopin's highly addictive.  Let's get the real answer.  Dr. Steve.  Hello, boys.  Klonopin, addicting or not?  No, absolutely.  It's a benzodiazepine.  It's in the same class of drugs as Valium is. 
[02:29:30]  And so, when you say addicting, what you really mean is if you take it for a long time and you stop, do you get a withdrawal syndrome?  And the answer for Klonopin is yes.  Ah, see.  No, Rich is different.  No, no, no.  You're different.  I didn't say I was different.  I didn't say I know what I'm doing.  You understand addiction.  What's that?  You said don't preach about addiction.  I understand addiction.  Okay, I do understand that.  And if they are addictive, I'm not doing it enough.  I do.  I just drink once in a while.  No, no, stop it.  Did the doctor prescribe you to drink? 
[02:30:00]  Did the doctor say, hey, go drink?  Okay, there's a difference.  You're not a doctor.  When a doctor says, okay, this is going to help you.  A doctor of love.  Okay.  You know what?  I really know what I'm doing.  I do.  I know what I do.  Famous last words.  No, I know what I'm doing.  Because you're bigger than this.  No, I'm not bigger than this.  I'm not going to.  Aw, shit.  When the doctor says, this is.  Chris Farley said the same thing.  Sure, I know.  Really? 
[02:30:30]  Yes, he did.  Yeah, he did.  It's a known fact.  We can look it up.  All right.  Dr. Steve, so Rich Voss is playing with fire, right?  No, I'm not.  Relapsing, probably.  Well, everybody's different.  You know, if you, your goal is to be totally clean and sober and avoid any kind of trigger  drugs, then, you know, I would avoid Klonopin.  But, you know, there are people there.  Look, there are people who were alcoholics who somehow can drink socially now. 
[02:31:00]  There you go.  You know, it's so funny.  Yeah, thank you, Dr. Steve.  No, really?  That's what Rich thinks.  Are you terrible a little bit too, Richard?  Here's the thing.  Okay, hold on.  Someone get Richard beer.  Hold on.  You know what?  I'm not.  Okay, Dr. Steve, you just said, how about when somebody is in recovery and has, like,  maybe an abscess on their tooth and they're in major pain and it's all pussed out and swollen  and infected and they get a painkiller?  Do you think, hey, tough it out, addict?  No, you're supposed to take what's prescribed to you. 
[02:31:30]  You're the people who are prescribing them, okay?  My doctor knows I'm in recovery, okay?  So he knows I have 25 years sober, so he's not going to sit there.  And when it says take two a day and I take maybe one a month and one every two months or  even maybe one a week, okay, then I'm not abusing it.  If it says take two a day and then I take four a day and I'm melting them down, then there's  a problem.  Absolutely.  If you just do, like, a little shot once in a while, it's not a big deal.  It doesn't have to do with a little whiskey on the tooth. 
[02:32:00]  I hear the panic in Rich's voice.  Everyone else is here.  I know.  Everyone else is here.  You know, hold on, hold on.  There's a very good example of what Rich just said.  Good old Ronnie B. had his appendix out.  Guess what?  What?  Not one painkiller.  Not one painkiller?  Not a one.  Yeah, because he's a big guy.  It sucks it up a lot easier.  Oh, really?  You try to get your appendix cut out of you without feeling so fucking pain.  Maybe I'll do that on my way to heal me.  Here's the thing.  Excellent.  Let me respond to that. 
[02:32:30]  Standard of care is that when you have someone that's in extreme pain and they are a user,  that you have, you know, he's right.  You have to try to treat their pain.  So what you end up doing is counseling them that this medication is probably going to trigger your addiction again  and giving them what's called informed consent.  Now, what Ronnie B. decided to do was to refuse, and he had every right to do that, 
[02:33:00]  and I think he suffered quite a bit for that, but he felt that that was the only way that he could survive that.  Other people do choose to take it.  Some of them have problems.  Not other people.  Rich Voss.  They have to go right back into rehab again.  Some do.  You're right.  Other people can get away with it because they are taking it for a medical purpose.  Well, Voss took it for the medical purpose.  A fat man was using the restroom on a flight, so that was why Voss decided he needed to tie one on  because a fat man was using the bathroom.  And needs one every once in a while when he leaves a radio show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Got to take a Kalani. 
[02:33:30]  Or is it before?  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry when the anxiety is triggered.  I'm sorry that I can't handle the anxiety.  We're just looking out for you.  We're worried about you.  Oh, yeah, really?  Yeah.  How come you don't call me at 6 in the evening and go,  How are you doing?  We're worried about you.  All right, you can't only be worried.  You're probably too loaded from your Kalani pins.  How do you know I didn't call you?  You're fucking a drug addict.  Yeah, exactly.  Why?  Because I saw it because you were tweeting something at the time.  All right?  All right.  Here's the deal.  I know anything.  How many Kalanis are you going to have to take after this show?  None.  It'll probably pass.  Maybe a half?  It'll probably pass.  You're hoping, right? 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I'll go home, sleep, wake up, and I won't have anxiety.  I've had anxiety since I was 21, okay?  For a year and a half, I was on Paxil, and guess what?  I weaned myself off it.  Now, I was in the middle of recovery, but I had major anxiety when I was 40.  Really, major, major anxiety.  Dr. Steve, is Rich Voss relapsing?  It sounds like he's taking it for a medical purpose, but he is at risk of relapsing.  No question about that.  I'm at risk of relapsing every night. 
[02:34:30]  I go to work in a nightclub.  Yeah, but this is good.  Okay, but you're not actually taking liquor in a nightclub and dumping it on your forehead  and just keeping your mouth closed.  Okay, really?  Every time...  Listen, you know what?  It's all...  One thing you're not addicted to is fucking lotion and Vaseline.  Fucking mummy fingers.  Yeah, is that a side effect of Rich Voss' drug addiction?  His hands are very dry and scaly.  Can someone tell Iraq to get back in the booth?  Rich Voss has nooks and crannies on his hands. 
[02:35:00]  Hey, Thomas' English muffin fingers.  Is that a side effect of his drug addiction, sir?  Hey, Rich, you know there are...  And you mentioned Paxil, which is not my favorite.  Yeah, this was years ago when I...  This was 13 years ago.  Well, it has a lot of sexual side effects.  Don't you have to do something with that?  Oh, no.  And so do I.  What are the sexual side effects?  There are other medications for anxiety that are not...  You know, that don't put you at risk as much as Klonopin does.  Yeah.  Some kind of root or St. John's wort?  No, no. 
[02:35:30]  Well, you know, some of the newer antidepressants are really good for anxiety and don't have  the sexual side effects.  Cymbalta is one.  Pristique is another one.  You know, they just have a lot fewer side effects, but work for anxiety without having  a withdrawal syndrome.  Hey, wait.  Do they help with depression?  Because I think I'm a little manic.  I've always been afraid that my creativity or whatever will be fucked up and that I won't  be able to get erections.  Yeah, a lot of people have that concern, and it is a problem for some people. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, it is.  That's why I don't do it.  I'm afraid my delicious cock won't work properly.  Well, Cymbalta, the new ones, have less sexual side effects.  That's not to say that they don't have any.  But, you know, any time if your creativity is somehow bound up in your anxiety, you know,  it may affect your creativity.  So, Rich, should get off the Connipin immediately.  Yeah.  I'm not on it.  Yeah, junkie.  Yeah, you're on it, kind of. 
[02:36:30]  I'm not on it.  You're sort of on it.  I'm not on it.  You're on it.  It's just, hey, Rich, you know, it's just if you want to be a purist, then you've got  to avoid that.  And if you don't, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  That's right.  Good point.  If you want to be a purist, you don't pick up a drug or a drink a day at a time.  Right.  There's your purist.  Every two months you can pick one up.  Okay.  When it's prescribed from a professional and it's in all the literature, it's in the big  book.  Fair enough.  Okay.  You are allowed to. 
[02:37:00]  Fair enough.  There you have it.  Yeah, I don't.  I'm not arguing with your doctor or if you can.  Dr. Vinnie Boom Butts.  Didn't you tell us recently that you're itching to gamble a little bit, too?  No.  On the show, I think you said.  You did.  Oh.  Liar.  You did, right?  Liar, liar.  Now you're calling me.  I'm not going for anything here.  What?  You actually said it.  Craps.  It's not.  Look, this isn't.  Well, guess what?  The show just turned into intervention and it shouldn't even have to be.  Well, it wouldn't be if you were just doing the right things instead of fucking popping 
[02:37:30]  pills every once in a while.  Every time a big fatso with a briefcase has to shit, all of a sudden you've got to tie one  on.  Oh, no.  I've got to get loaded.  The captain's hat is crooked.  Oh, no.  I didn't get my tomato juice.  Oh, no.  Fucking coach in Vegas.  How many Klonopins did you get?  I still got them from three years ago.  I still have jars from three years ago.  Of course, jars.  Just save them.  Why wouldn't you?  No, they're full.  Klonopin.  Exactly.  They're full.  So why don't you throw them away?  You don't need all those jars. 
[02:38:00]  Full jars of Klonopin.  Why do you need them?  Huh?  Why do you need them?  Saving stuff.  Why?  I'm a hoarder.  Hoarding.  Exactly.  I'm a hoarder.  I really am.  You hoard stupid cells.  Very smart.  I'm very smart.  You're not very smart.  I'm very smart.  You're not even...  I have two kids in college.  What kind of dumb parent could raise two kids that aren't doing well, okay?  I can give you my list of all of my major mental credits throughout history.  Give me one.  I used to run a business when I was 21 with eight employees. 
[02:38:30]  21.  You couldn't save enough.  You had to blow people for drugs.  How good could you...  I didn't have good...  It's between half and one, okay?  How big could you...  What was the business?  When I used to remodel houses.  That shitty house painting thing.  I had a good business.  No, you didn't.  He'd find bed bug fucking dressers and fucking throw green paint on them and sell them to  Spanish people.  What are you doing?  I had a big business back in the day.  I did.  Your business stunk.  I had a big business.  This guy used to drive a forklift in a warehouse. 
[02:39:00]  I had a big business.  Oh, no.  Well, that's always the sign of a fucking...  Who is this?  Warren Buffett on a forklift?  That's the sign of a big business.  Not the Fortune magazine.  No, I said you, dummy.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  I did.  But I'm not claiming to be a fucking...  I'm not claiming to be a fucking...  You know, I'm claiming to be brilliant.  No, I didn't.  All right.  Hold on.  We got another Dr. Steve that wants to talk to Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve.  Yeah.  Good morning, boys.  Rich, you don't have to worry.  I make a red wine called a Kalani Merlot and he never drinks it twice, so it's not 
[02:39:30]  addicting.  That's good.  Like Jim Florentine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was more of a Florentine.  He was more of a Jim Florentine.  It's not really a Dr. Steve.  It's a Jim Florentine.  Any other questions?  Hey, Rich.  No.  Yeah.  Rich, what kind of physical symptoms do you have when you have your anxiety?  Yeah.  Oh.  What kind of physical?  Yeah.  What kind of physical symptoms do you have when you have your anxiety?  I don't have physical symptoms whatsoever. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, no physical symptoms.  Physical?  So what is it?  Well, sometimes, you know...  Do you sweat a little bit?  Do you...  No.  No.  He said no physical symptoms.  I don't want to talk about anxiety now.  I really don't.  I know I've generalized anxiety disorder.  He doesn't want us to help him out.  I've been diagnosed many times.  You can't help me out.  Look at...  It's like...  Look at all three of you.  You're all messes in your own way.  Whoa.  Why are you thinking about us all of a sudden?  I don't take pills.  Ooh.  Yeah.  I don't take pills.  We're trying to make you a better person.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You might beat us up over that.  Then get me in with Stern. 
[02:40:30]  Good.  Go over there right now.  Go over there right now.  Go ahead.  Do a show.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, look at...  Oh, go ahead.  Look at...  I like being here.  You're not helping me.  You're making the anxiety worse.  Howard actually likes you a lot.  Huh?  Howard actually likes you a lot.  Yeah.  He was saying the other day in the hall.  Really?  First of all, you two probably haven't talked ever.  I've spoken to him.  No.  Not about you, but I have.  Oh, whoa.  I'm just saying.  Something else is putting on your resume.  But he likes you, so...  No, he doesn't.  Yeah.  That's who you brought up. 
[02:41:00]  I didn't hang up on Dr. Steve, by the way.  He's gone.  Oh, he took off.  No, I don't know.  I swear.  My hands are right here.  Oh, Dr. Steve.  I wanted to continue with that, because he was asking you some good questions.  Yeah, and you were just panicking and told me, hey, you want to go on Howard and Bubba  and her?  And all of a sudden, when nobody's...  What are you, if you want to go on people who aren't going to call you out?  Because he probably thinks, hey, look what Artie got away with over there.  Maybe I can go.  There you go.  Yeah, he'll be able to do your Klonopins and fucking throw out your funny lines over there. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, he wants people to fucking co-sign his thing.  Like, yeah, what's the Klonopin?  That's what he's waiting for.  Once in a while, it's every good man's fault.  We're not going to tell you that.  Whatever makes you funny, Rich, we don't care.  Yeah.  That's what he would say to you.  You're wrong.  But you got real friends over here.  I know.  That's right.  We know nothing's going to make you funny.  And we see the cracks.  You're starting to crack a little bit.  Yeah, they're in my hands.  Yes, they are.  Yeah, I got more cracks than I'm on board.  Rich, how about the big plug?  What?  Where's your anxiety-ridden body going to be? 
[02:42:00]  Tonight we're doing a benefit for the PBA, Union PBA at Union High School Theater.  Bonnie, Rich Voss, Bobby Kelly, and Kenny Michaels.  And this weekend, Helium Comedy Club.  Who's Kenny Michaels?  I've never heard of him.  I didn't book him.  He's a comic.  He's a local New Jersey guy.  Local boy made good.  Good for him, then.  Yeah, he's going to be on the show.  And then the weekend down there in Philly.  Helium, Friday and Saturday.  I'm going to work on a new CD.  You know what?  I had to listen to my last two CDs.  Slow down.  You all right?  I wanted to plug something, but you just jumped on it. 
[02:42:30]  That was a plug-in to break, and now you're starting other things.  I'm sorry.  I didn't see the break sign, okay?  Usually I see that in places.  Hold on.  This Friday.  On real shows.  Next Friday, I'll be in D.C. with the boys doing our fucking anti-social network show.  We're on the Pentagon during the day.  It should be a lot of fun.  People want to know why Ant was so quiet during the whole intervention thing with Rich Voss.  Why?  Really?  Oh, what?  No, I was...  I had a tweet...  Not tweet, texting.  I can't even fucking... 
[02:43:00]  What's wrong with your throat?  You're not supposed to curse.  I have a...  Cum in it.  Yeah, chism in my lungs.  It's...  No, I'm just getting over a cold, and it's that cough part.  I know it is.  Where it's just...  That dry cough fucking sucks.  This is why Ant's vocals are so clogged.  Like, blowing somebody is one thing.  Yeah, yeah.  But that was the type where your head is hanging over the bed, and it's pinned by thrusting  man thighs.  And literally the cum lands on your lungs.  Oh, shit. 
[02:43:30]  Jesus.  You got a spot on your lung.  What was I saying?  I don't know.  Something about a CD and all that.  Do you guys ever listen to yourselves on radio?  Have you ever listened to...  No, never.  Do you have my new CD?  I don't have your old or any of your CDs.  Are you kidding me?  What happened?  Do you ever have to listen to your CD?  Don't you hate listening to them?  I had to listen to both of mine.  No, I hate listening to yours.  No, I'm kidding.  Yeah, no, I don't mind my CDs.  There'll be bits on them, and I'm like... 
[02:44:00]  I know.  But there's some parts of it I like, some parts of it I don't.  Well, my second one, I was listening to it coming in.  I'm going, that's not a bad CD, but I have to listen to it to make another one, so you  don't want to repeat any kind of lines.  Wayans Brothers just went into the black show.  I thought they were already in there.  I just saw them walk in.  They only have more than one.  I just saw them walk in.  I want to get a show.  I only have...  I do want a picture with those guys.  Listen, when we get back, Rich is going to control the show.  Oh, nice.  We'll talk about whatever you want next.  But we got to get the genital guy on. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, so you got him on the air?  Yes.  Yeah.  Oh, I fucking read the story yesterday.  Are we going to bring the genital guy in next?  You want to interview him?  Yeah.  Just don't ask about his head or his penis.  No, I won't.  He hates this.  He had a great cover-up.  That shit is crazy.  Does this make sense to anyone?  I just need to know. 
[02:45:00]  You got your damn jacket.  How do you think you're Fonzie's store working partner?  Up next, we're going to talk to the guy that was beat, tattooed, and tased in the genitalia.  Oh, nice.  Tattooed in the genitals.  Tattooed in the genitals.  Yeah, in the genitals.  In the genitals.  He was tattooed.  Genitals.  Perhaps my wording wasn't something.  Wait.  Man beat, tattooed, and tased in the genitals.  Beat, tattooed...  What?  It should read more like man beat, tased, maybe semi-colon, tased in the genitals. 
[02:45:30]  In the genitals.  Oh, so not all the...  Well, it's not like they tattooed his genitals.  Yeah, yeah.  That would be a very big day for the genitals.  How it's written, it's great.  It took a bunch of punches to the balls, then they tased his fucking ball.  Then they tattooed the genitals as well, but they tattooed some other spots.  Oh, okay.  We got that guy, and Rich, do you want to talk to him next?  Yeah, why not?  I want to see how you do an interview.  It's an exclusive.  The guy decided to talk to us, so...  Whoa.  All right? 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  So if we get that guy on the phone, that'd be good.  I'm pretty good at interviews.  All right.  Stay there.  Rich Voss, next.  Sirius XM, the virus.  This is the OB and Anthony Show.  The OB and Anthony Show.  I think you're left with just me, because Jimmy's not here, Rich is not here, and I don't think 
[02:46:30]  Anthony can talk anymore.  His voice is shot.  I'm better now.  I don't know what happened like today.  That, that, that, that, that, that.  I was doing a read before, and my voice just stopped working.  A big hunk of phlegm got in there.  It's not like you've done a hundred live reads in the last week.  No, it's Mother's Day, you know.  Mother's Day is this Sunday.  Yeah.  In case we didn't know.  Fuck.  Where's Rich Voss?  He's supposed to talk to, uh...  Where is he?  The guy that got beat up, tased, and tattooed. 
[02:47:00]  So did he get...  Yes, dude, screwed, and tattooed, motherfuckers.  And Rich has decided he doesn't need to do the radio show anymore.  He's, he's outside the studio, lounging, talking to the Wayan Brothers.  Look at him.  Yeah, the Wayans Brothers are out there.  Look, he's holding court with the Wayans Brothers.  So, um...  Or the Wayans Brothers.  Wayans Brothers.  Wayans Brothers.  And, uh...  Which two we got out there?  Jimmy's, uh...  I don't even know which ones they are.  I know, they all look alike.  Which ones are they?  Meaning the brothers, I think, of course.  They're the black ones. 
[02:47:30]  I mean, the Wayans Brothers.  They all look alike.  Oh, now look at Rich.  Now he's, like, using his hands.  Huh?  So when you're acting...  He's trying to keep his confidence together.  You can see that he's ready to fall apart.  What is he doing?  I was on Def Jam.  Now he turned all the way around where one of the Wayans Brothers...  He's, like, orbiting them.  Yeah, had to completely turn around to follow him.  What is he doing?  He started in front of him, and then next thing you know, he's behind him, and the guy 
[02:48:00]  had to actually turn all the way around to follow Rich Voss.  They have to be like, why are we fucking...  Why do we have to deal with this motherfucker?  Oh, he got a laugh out of one of the Wayans Brothers.  Yeah, it looked like a courtesy laugh.  Was that a courtesy laugh?  Yeah, because he just stopped.  There's a lot of hand movement.  He's got sunglasses on, so he doesn't have to look at them.  And is the publicist, like, ready to go, okay, they got to go somewhere.  And I read lips.  He just said, you know what I'm saying?  You know what I'm saying?  And he just said, here's the deal.  I know the struggle.  I know when he says, here's the deal.  I know the struggle.  And I guess Jimmy's giving up on the show, too. 
[02:48:30]  So it's...  I guess we have to talk to Tattoo Guy.  What?  Tattoo Guy.  Oh, Tattoo Taser.  Yeah, yeah.  Genital.  His name is Stetson?  What?  Let me say hi to Stetson for a second.  Stetson.  Hey.  Hello.  Hello.  Hi, Stetson.  So you're going to talk to Rich Voss about what happened to your balls and shaft?  Sure, yeah.  All right, Stetson.  Stetson?  It's a pretty cool name. 
[02:49:00]  It's a rock.  It's like a hat.  Where's Rich so he could interview Stetson?  Stetson.  Must be a 10-gallon hat.  Wait, wait, wait.  Yeah, just do that.  Let's hear how Rich handles this.  I do it just to build and get bigger.  And when you get to the place where you see shit in the stadiums, you know, you're up  in a journey of...  Oh.  I couldn't fucking tell that goddamn fuck.  Yeah.  I gotta go back here.  All right.  You too.  I'm taking these, bro.  All right.  Good to see you, man.  Good to see you, man.  Good to see you, man. 
[02:49:30]  Good to see you, man.  Good to see you, man.  Good to see you, man.  Good to see you, man.  All right, man.  How do you want to see you, man?  How are you doing?  Hmm.  Should we have them, man?  I don't know.  They're very cool guys, man.  Very cool dudes.  Yeah.  None of us said no to them, really.  Bring them in if you want.  All right.  See if she...  Do you want them to...  Hey, Kenny.  See if they want to come in.  Yeah.  What are they doing?  Which two are they?  I know.  That's cool.  Sean and Marlon.  Marlon. 
[02:50:00]  I don't know.  They might have other press, but where's Kenny?  Is he asking?  Are there two microphones?  Oh, they might have other things.  Oh, they're coming in.  Uh...  Give me a microphone.  No.  Did you see if there's another microphone?  Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.  We're live.  It's kind of stupid not to have you guys on the air.  What's up, guys?  What's up, man?  How you doing, man?  What's up?  What's up, guys?  Good.  What's up?  Tangin'.  How you doing, man?  Well, there's that set still leaves only this one microphone.  Okay.  I apologize.  I mean, of course you guys should come in. 
[02:50:30]  You're hanging out with Rich and Jimmy outside the studio.  I'm like, yeah, bring them in.  Yeah, they're doing...  What the fuck?  Are you guys playing the Stress Factory?  Yeah, we'll have the Stress Factory.  Go ahead.  Okay, cool.  Stress Factory.  Nice.  This is tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday, right?  Yeah.  And you guys obviously know Rich and Jimmy pretty well.  Yeah, pretty well.  From the close.  Yeah.  I was scared to say hi to him, because he always looks angry.  Jimmy always looks angry?  He's actually a really nice guy, but he just looks like, leave me the fuck alone.  Well, in a stand-up, that's his thing. 
[02:51:00]  And Rich, I noticed, was holding court out there, making you guys laugh.  No, I wasn't.  No, I'm just talking.  You were holding court, Rich.  All I was thinking is you guys had to be like, oh, fucking Rich, just get him away, man.  That's what they were thinking about when they saw you guys in studio, they were trying  to get the fuck out of here.  And then you went and tapped with him, you fucking desperate fucking radio host.  Shut the fuck up.  They were on their way fucking home.  You're pulling out the angry comedy seller guy right there.  That was your... 
[02:51:30]  Rich, trust me, Rich will pay for what he just said.  He's on a roll right now, but he will punch himself out because he has fucking terrible  instincts.  Anyone to keep you off, Mike, Rich.  There you go.  Get me, okay.  We just upgraded.  Mike, wow.  Gonna throw the brother's drug out there.  Yeah, Rich is back on drugs, we learned today.  I got 25 years clean.  25 years.  He does a Klonopin every once in a while.  He must have been crazy.  I just want to say about people that get real sober, they must have been really crazy people. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  For you to never...  Like, I got this friend, Phil Bowman, who will never drink liquor again.  He's only like 40.  I'm like...  But I want him to do it.  Did you go through it?  Don't you ever want someone to go back to the way they were just so that you can have  some fun with him?  He's not that fun.  Like, you take him out to the club, he doesn't drink, he doesn't do none of this stuff.  It's like, do some fucking crap.  I don't trust sober guys.  I hate to say it, but Jimmy stopped at 17.  I was 18 when I stopped.  18.  But at that age, and I said at that age, everyone fucks up.  I didn't start at 13.  Yeah, but everyone does fuck up. 
[02:52:30]  No one's responsible drinking at that age.  Yeah, but I was calling the FBI.  It was fucking horrendous.  He just knew.  I knew it was a problem.  That could be a problem.  Calling the FBI.  Yeah, and I complimented, inadvertently, I complimented Sean on Requiem, which was stupid.  Oh, that was me.  Yeah, no, I know.  As soon as I said it.  But you were 13 when you saw it, so you didn't know.  That movie, fuck, it was so good.  Hold on.  Okay, then you talk about it.  Okay.  We're so excited we're talking about something he knows about. 
[02:53:00]  I can always tell the drug addicts, because they always go, I love Requiem, man.  Requiem was the greatest movie.  Okay, you were sucked on heroin.  Honestly, it kept me on drugs.  It's like doing that movie, it was, seeing how the downward spiral of, because there was  no candy coat, and the heroes, everybody lost.  It bothered me.  I literally had to walk around my apartment after that movie.  I saw it.  I was living on 43rd Street.  I had to get up and walk around the apartment.  Did you call the FBI?  What's that?  He gently put his crack pipe down and walked around the apartment. 
[02:53:30]  So you mean to tell me you didn't call two girls over, give them a double head dildo,  and go, ass to ass, ass to ass, ass to ass.  It did make me want to be on that side of the drug trade.  You know what?  Drug use is bad, but if you got them to sell, you got to get them ass to ass.  Fucking let her lost his arm in that.  This fucking girl is prostituting herself.  The mother was crazy.  It was a very fucking disturbing film.  You guys haven't seen it?  I got to be honest, I haven't seen it.  I'm not saying because I'm in it, I'm probably the worst thing in it, but you should watch that 
[02:54:00]  movie.  It's a brilliant, brilliant movie.  It's fucking great, dude.  My favorite part is ass to ass.  I know nothing about drugs.  But if you can get somebody to ass to ass, I'm laughing my ass off.  It was Keith David from Platoon, and he had the girls, and he wouldn't fuck them for  drugs.  He made them do dildo shows, which was fucking, it was just so youth-like.  Oh, a gentleman.  Yeah, of course.  He is a gentleman.  That's how you do it.  You don't make a big dick in a heart.  That's it. 
[02:54:30]  That's it.  The heart of gold.  I got to see that, man.  Can we ask Rich what his favorite part of the movie was?  Because he did yell and he saw it.  I did see it for like two weeks ago for the first time, which everybody's talking about  it, and they said it'll make you feel all, you know, like this.  I guess the best part was looking at his scabbed arm.  That was probably my favorite part.  When he was in jail?  No, you fucking idiot.  It was disgusting.  You stupid, big Google-eye fuck.  Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, AIDS fingers. 
[02:55:00]  I don't think you heard what I said.  You're attacking your real friend.  You hear what I said?  He attacked me.  No, I didn't.  I said, by the way, apology is coming.  What?  You said when his arm was all scabbed, and I said when he was in jail, because it was  a scene when he was in jail and he couldn't get the treatment.  Is that when you meant?  And you jumped all over me.  He was right.  Do we have that, Travis?  That little crazy voice.  Apology came.  Apology came. 
[02:55:30]  He said sorry.  He's a fucking, what a mean little man you are.  I'm not a mean little man.  Yes, you are.  Yeah, you're kind of mean today.  What did you think I said?  Well, that's mean.  I was hostile.  You're not the curse, remember?  You don't want to go on in jail.  I got to be honest, I was scared.  Listen, you don't want to go on in jail.  I was a little nervous.  You don't want to go on in jail.  Yeah, we got to deal with that Obama traffic today, dude.  Oh, man.  I'm so out of here.  It's the worst traffic ever.  Imagine a black president, everyone's trying to kill him.  So he's blocking off.  His security is like crazy.  It's two states wide.  I can't leave my house, dude. 
[02:56:00]  Come on.  And then Bin Laden's dead, so that's even more security.  Dude, we did Fox News this morning.  Like, they don't like him.  You're just figuring that out?  Yeah.  They're just trying to find reasons.  It's like, just say, I don't like the fact that America has a black president.  Oh, that's right.  I'd be comfortable with that.  I think that's fair enough.  He got Bin Laden.  I mean, come on.  What else does he have to do?  And they're still spinning it.  Yeah.  George Bush gave the order.  Balance the budget?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I had to give him credit for it. 
[02:56:30]  It's like, he's the commander-in-chief, and if he doesn't get it done, he gets blamed.  You've got to give him credit when it gets done.  He's fucking got it done.  He did.  There's another reason to call the FBI.  Well, here's a nice thing.  Here's a nice thing.  The thing about Osama being dead is there's a job opening available.  Al-Qaeda is hiring.  Yeah, yeah.  They need a new CEO.  Number one position.  Who the fuck wants that guy?  You think they'll hire from within?  Yeah, they're probably.  Yeah, it's probably Leviticus.  I don't think Fox is.  Al-Qaeda and McDonald's hiring.  They were so tense, though. 
[02:57:00]  They really...  Did you challenge them on anything, or you guys were just fooling around?  No, we were just fooling around.  I was just fooling around.  I didn't want to get on that shit.  You know what?  I don't believe in government that much, do I?  I'm going to sit there and fight.  Get all serious on that shit.  I barely voted this time.  That's me right there.  I went out to vote because I was like, you know what?  We have a chance to get a black guy in office.  I may never see this in my lifetime.  I didn't vote for Jesse, and he didn't win.  So let's give this a whirl.  That was the only reason you voted?  Yeah.  Yeah, but he's not really black.  He's light-skinned.  So you know what I mean?  Well, he's still black.  His hair naps up in the back.  It kicks him. 
[02:57:30]  He was just racial profiled on the biggest scale ever.  They pulled him over and asked him for his birth certificate.  He's black.  I'm not a nigger.  Show me your ID.  I'm the president.  Yeah.  Let us see your ID.  Sure you are.  Rich?  What?  I'm just wondering if you want to humiliate anybody else.  Yeah, really?  You're right.  I saw a nice moment before.  Do you have that, Travis?  This is what you did.  So you're a friend of 20-some-odd years. 
[02:58:00]  I did it for like two weeks ago for the first time.  Everybody's talking about it, and they said it'll make you feel all, you know, like this.  I guess the best part was looking at his scabbed arm.  That was probably my favorite part.  When he was in jail?  No, you fucking idiot.  It was disgusting.  You're just not a good friend.  You're not a nice person.  He really came out of nowhere with that.  There was no reason to be so violent.  I just love the banter of your googly-eyed fuck and AIDS fingers.  His fingers.  I fucking, I Twittered his fingers this morning. 
[02:58:30]  Can we get that picture up?  His fucking hands are disgusting.  I tried to do his chin, but he doesn't have one.  Yeah, that was all right.  You see?  Yeah, they were kind of fucked up.  Oh, that wasn't very nice.  Over the top again.  I got small hands.  I hope you didn't shake his hand.  Don't touch his hands.  What's it from, though?  There's nothing wrong with it.  Oh, they're all, it's all cracked up.  They're not ashy.  He's got fucking giant cuticles.  He's got fucking giant cuticles.  He plays golf.  He plays too much golf.  You play golf?  Yeah, all the time.  I wish I had time.  I don't have time.  I said, you know what?  Fuck golf until I'm like old.  Well, yeah.  I'm like 65.  Oh, wow. 
[02:59:00]  How old are you?  I'll be 54 next month.  Yeah, play golf.  Four.  I'm so glad that nobody said, really?  You're 54?  I know, right?  Yes, how old I was.  I know, but then you said 54, and you were hoping somebody would go, wow, no one said that.  He's like, all right, good, play golf.  He said exactly what they thought.  Exactly.  That's about right.  That looks right.  That's his hand.  That's his hand.  Yeah, we tweeted it.  How fucking horrible is that?  Yeah, yeah, what the fuck is he doing with his fingernails? 
[02:59:30]  And then he has a dead finger, we think.  It's all gray and shit.  I don't have a dead finger.  What is this green shit?  Yeah, what is that?  Yeah, that's the dead finger.  That's the fucking internet.  Who did you finger pop with that?  Yeah, that's...  It's like you finger pop the arm in Requiem.  And caught some shit.  No, we learned he doesn't like finger...  Hand chlamydia.  He doesn't like finger popping.  Hand chlamydia.  That's crazy.  He doesn't like finger popping?  He doesn't finger pop his wife.  What am I getting out of it?  Pussy, maybe?  You got to weigh it somehow.  If her pants are off, I'm getting pussy. 
[03:00:00]  I don't have to finger.  I'll fuck her.  You're one of those guys that's going to do it dry until you find some wet, like oil?  I got fucking oil in the...  You got shit in the bathroom.  Some jelly shit.  Although, when I use this shit with mine...  Some jelly shit.  It makes it so slippery that I'm going, her pussy's a lot bigger.  You know what?  Because it's so slippery.  When it was tight, you know?  Yeah, you need friction.  You know, just do a little quick spit or something, you know what I'm saying?  There's one more thing that could be happening there that...  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  How about you lick it and make it wet instead of... 
[03:00:30]  Well, you're giving me fucking pointers on pussy?  Yes, I am.  Get the fuck...  You know how much pussy I used to get you?  Stand up.  I know how to get pussy, okay?  I know how to get pussy.  I'm married.  I can't do it now.  But you know how much pussy I used to get.  You get a lot of pussy.  Huh?  And he sits down.  Look at you guys.  You guys instigate these guys.  Oh, I know.  You just shake up the B's and then open the jar.  I love this.  I figured it out.  I like to love Voss.  I love Voss, but he's a stupid person.  So you're saying he doesn't get laid?  No, he gets laid.  Look at him.  But you used to get Jimmy the pussy?  He gets laid. 
[03:01:00]  One, he's got a nice dick.  He's got a big dick.  I'm not going to lie.  How do you know?  Thank you.  Oh, I know because we've done girls together.  Oh, they fuck with the same girl.  What?  We've all seen Jimmy's at the same time.  You lost me.  I've never done the same girl.  What do you do?  First of all, I was...  One time, I was with this Puerto Rican girl, and she was blowing me, and he was sitting  in the backseat of the car jerking off.  Yeah.  You know, he goes, can I watch?  I go, what the fuck?  He already had his dick out.  He's going to ask you after?  That's like not the right etiquette.  Well, I figured then he feels embarrassed to say no.  Like, all right, your dick's already out.  You might as well.  It's like asking a guest to leave once they're in the living room.  That's like the dude sticking his hand in a bag of chips and go, can I get some? 
[03:01:30]  You took some.  Tell him the famous threesome story.  That was you two, right?  The one in Central Park?  No, the one where...  The one in Central Park, threesome jumping.  We've had a few.  You mean the Puerto Rican Day Parade where you guys got arrested?  The one where the girl was in the middle, and then...  There was a girl...  Just tell these guys.  We fucked around with this chick, and she was in the middle, and Voss was fooling around.  He was jerking off, and I was jerking off, and she was in the middle kind of playing  with our dicks.  And he came first.  On you?  No, no, no, no.  On himself.  Who knew that first shot probably got on you? 
[03:02:00]  You just don't know about it.  I wouldn't have cared.  I'm a trooper.  I probably would have kept going.  Sometimes you've got to fucking man up.  Take one for the team.  Absolutely.  Who am I to fucking stop?  It's just skin, right?  So he's fucking in the bathroom, and I'm finally with her alone jerking off.  And I guess she had a cat box, and he could smell the cat shit.  And I'm jerking off, and I hear...  What is this, guys?  Yeah, yeah.  Sorry you had to hear this.  That's insane.  Yeah, right.  We picked up this girl.  I picked up this girl at the cellar. 
[03:02:30]  This girl was so fucking fun.  No, it wasn't at the cellar.  That was outside of SOB's.  She was outside of SOB's on fucking...  On Houston, and she recognized you from Boston Comedy.  No, not that one.  That was the black chick.  I'm talking about the white chick that we took back.  I'll tell you, the black chick was the whole Central Park store.  Yes.  But the white chick that I picked up in the cellar, and I was driving back, and you're in  the backseat, and we go back to your apartment.  Wasn't she a comic?  No, no.  Okay.  No, this is the other one.  We go back to your apartment.  How many times?  I know.  Are you sure Tyler?  How many times have you been there? 
[03:03:00]  It was Wanda.  No, I'm not Wanda.  Wanda Sights?  So, I'm with the girl in his apartment.  She's talking about that.  Whatever.  I don't know.  But this jackass is jerking off next to me.  What?  I'm trying to tell the story.  Did I do something wrong again?  No, go ahead.  And he's jerking...  He's totally distracted.  Exactly.  He's jerking off, and then I look, and he shoots a load in his own face.  Is that right?  Oh, shit.  Did I really?  You just black out when you're jerking off.  That's some range.  Yeah. 
[03:03:30]  Wow.  Don't you remember we made her sign?  Over the left eye.  I had a good...  Oh, my God.  We made her sign paper that said she had fun.  Osama.  I fucking forgot about that.  We did do that.  That's hysterical.  So, she couldn't say we raped her.  Oh, that would hold up in court.  That's my idea.  That's hilarious.  That would hold up.  I had fun.  That's the signature under duress.  I know.  I had fun.  Holy shit.  Look, here's the proof.  She had fun.  You had a great time.  There's a signature.  Oh, fucking two lawyers.  It's all shaky writing. 
[03:04:00]  It's all shaky.  Who wrote up the contract?  I don't remember.  It's all stuck together.  It's a brilliant idea of that.  Yeah, there's fucking blood drippings on it.  Oh, God.  Do you remember what the contract said?  No.  I don't remember doing it.  It was on the back of a tough crowd.  You know what?  You guys are an animated show.  Oh, it's insane.  You guys are an animated show on Fox.  We lost it, didn't we?  Shit.  Just your story.  We lost it a while ago.  You rape the girl.  We'll take care of the government.  That's a funny episode.  All right, good, good.  That's crazy.  We got to plug, too, because we're almost done. 
[03:04:30]  The Wayans Brothers, you can catch tonight through Sunday at the Stress Factory in New  Brunswick.  You guys have seen us there.  We'll be jerking off on stage again.  Nice.  With some victim in the middle.  Stressfactory.com for tickets.  Or 732-545-HA-HA.  You guys do separate sets, right?  Yes.  I go on first.  He goes on second.  Okay.  And Rich, where will you be?  But the money's the same.  Tonight, we're doing a PBA fundraiser in Union at the Union Theater at the high school.  And then this weekend at Helium in Philadelphia.  Okay.  And for myself, the Boneyard 10 o'clock.  My interview with Nikki Sixx is going to air, and you can catch me with Jim Brewer, David 
[03:05:00]  Tell, and Bill Burr, Constitution Hall, D.C. next Friday, the 13th.  That sounds like fucking fun right there.  Yeah, yeah.  It's been a good show.  That's a great show, actually.  Thank you, man.  Solid.  And there are tickets available for that next Friday night.  Tell Bill Burr I said what's up.  Okay.  Yeah, I will.  I'll talk to that.  That's a great show.  I'm jealous.  I got to get.  It's out.  I got to get Obama traffic.  All right.  Peace.  All right.  I got to get out of here, too.  So, yes.  Thanks to Sean and Marlon for coming in.  Sorry about that, man.  Of course you guys should have been on our show.  Are we done? 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, I guess we'll leave then.  Thanks, Rich.  All right, guys.  Hey, where were you at with the movie?  Hey, man.  Oh, it's going good.  Anytime.  All right, man.  Hey, man.  Thank you, brother.  Come back and do a longer set with us.  Definitely, man.  All right.  All right.  We'll leave, I guess, right?  Jimmy, L.A.?  We'll see you.  Yeah, I'm going to Kentucky today.  All right.  Wayans Brothers.  They're still on.  What?  Are we still on?  Yeah, we just fucking keep the mics on. 
[03:06:00]  What are we going to do?  They were cool.  You want it all polished and nice for you?  What?  Not you.  I'm just saying in general.  Those guys were fun, man.  Very cool.  Yeah, we obviously should have had them on.  Yeah, we could tell by talking to them outside.  They were just cool dudes.  Yeah, I don't know what happened there.  Well, you don't see them at the cellar.  I really never talked to them very briefly.  Just, hey, how are you?  And, you know, they're always, with comics, you're almost never going to be.  You know, it's so weird when you talk about Wrecking for, because here's the  thing.  I kept hearing about this movie, and then finally, that's why I got excited, because  I finally saw it two weeks ago.  Can I do it now? 
[03:06:30]  Sorry if I stepped on it.  Not really.  I don't care.  It's just funny.  Rich, we love you.  Yeah.  Hey, can you help out?  You might be falling apart, but we love you.  I am falling apart.  Are you falling apart?  No.  I got all excited.  Did you do that?  The meltdown on the show.  That was a real reaction.  I was like, are you?  Are you falling apart?  What, do you want to call me mom?  What are you doing?  I'm going to go see my mom.  Bye, guys.  You're out?  I'm going to do a live read, I guess.  Call me if you want to do this Saturday.  Um, yeah, all right. 
[03:07:00]  You can stick around.  We're going to do more radio, probably.  What do you mean?  Just go to break so I can do a live read,  and then we'll do some other shit.  This is the OPN at 3 Show.  The virus.  Serious exit. </pre>
