<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with the hosts proudly showcasing their unapologetically offensive and controversial style, immediately launching into banter filled with crude jokes, including one about a dog.  They then shifted to a discussion of a recent NYPD officer shooting, offering support for law enforcement while simultaneously criticizing the media's sensationalist coverage. This segued into a lengthy and darkly humorous debate about the death penalty, referencing execution statistics in various states, particularly New York and Texas, before and after the death penalty's reinstatement.  A caller, Max from Dallas, commented on the show's past troubles and decline after being removed from a station.  The hosts contrasted the execution of a Chinese official for food safety violations with what they perceived as lenient treatment of criminals in the US.  The absence of Jim Norton, whose book "Happy Endings" was released that day, was noted, with a detailed—and graphic—description of his nude book cover.  They also criticized the promotional material for Norton's upcoming TV appearance on "Jill TV," hosted by Jill Nicolini, focusing on the use of old Opie and Anthony clips and Jill's attire.  Further discussion of Norton's book, including a passage about a rest stop incident during a road trip, and a bizarre discussion about being attractive to gay men, followed.

The show incorporated listener participation segments, "Rock Scream Tuesday" and "Hummer Tuesday," both incorporating sexually suggestive humor.  Brother Elmo, a guest in the studio celebrating his birthday, was featured, along with anecdotes about historical plaques. Jim Norton eventually joined the broadcast, discussing his book, encounters with celebrities like Ozzy Osbourne and Gene Simmons, and his appearance on Channel 11's "Jill TV," including his interaction with Jill Nicolini and their shared photos, with some discussion of whether the book cover or title were shown on the segment.  Norton recounted a frustrating television appearance promoting his book, where the planned graphic was only shown online, prompting a "rock scream" from caller Ernie.

Tim's newly created sweepers, "Rock Scream Tuesday" and "Hummer Tuesday," were discussed, with "Hummer Tuesday" receiving criticism for poor audio quality and inappropriate content.  The "Far Away Phone Call Tuesday" sweeper also drew complaints about unrealistic sound effects.  A significant portion focused on mercilessly mocking intern Jared's physique, with graphic descriptions and comparisons to cartoon characters and Sasquatch.  The NAACP's symbolic burial of the N-word in Detroit was covered, sparking a discussion about the event's appropriateness, Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick's actions, and perceived hypocrisy in focusing on this while ignoring other issues, such as black-on-black crime. Callers offered diverse opinions, and the hosts provided cynical commentary.  This segment culminated in a bizarre, panic-filled attempt to use a Ouija board to contact the N-word.

A comedic dramatization of a seance surrounding the burial of the n-word, intended as satire, featured profane dialogue and references to deceased figures like Tupac.  The hosts then discussed their upcoming Philadelphia broadcast, including plans for the "WOW Motorcycle Run," featuring a U2 tribute band member and H. Cup Jane.  They also touched upon the station's attempts to pre-screen guests and the resulting conflict with corporate. A listener call followed, and Elmo's in-studio birthday celebration included the bizarre stunt of him injecting himself with insulin on air.  A phone call with Big A, a show staffer scheduled for neck surgery to remove a cyst (repeatedly referred to as a "B9"), followed, filled with dark humor and jokes about the surgery and potential complications.

The show continued with an update on Big A's upcoming surgery, humorous speculation about his last words, and comically exaggerated and inappropriate reviews of Jim Norton's book, often referencing Norton's supposed death from AIDS.  Calls from listeners in New Zealand (whose location was debated), Mexico, Arizona, and Portland, Oregon, ensued, often devolving into absurd conversations about blowjobs and bizarre situations.  New sweepers were introduced, some met with negative reactions from Anthony. A lengthy discussion of a street interview conducted by Jared and Brian regarding the NAACP's burial of the N-word, featuring interview clips, followed.  Jared's film, "Big Boy Made of Duty," was also discussed.  The Amazon ranking of Jim Norton's book was a topic of conversation, along with humorous speculations and commentary.  More listener calls, further commentary on the book rankings, news items, and promotion of the upcoming WISP broadcast and Jim Norton's book signing followed. Francine, a studio guest, briefly mentioned writing a book about pizza and sex.

The show included a nonsensical exchange about meteors and meteorites.  Francine then told a joke about leaving elderly relatives out in the heat to die. A discussion of a Halle Berry lookalike suing a doctor for groping her during a job interview, after allegedly showing her pornographic pictures, followed. The hosts made crude remarks about the woman and the situation.  They then discussed Nicole Richie's pregnancy, with derogatory comments about her, her father, and her lifestyle choices. A listener suggested injecting Elmo into Nicole Richie's head, prompting one host to simulate injecting something into his own head.  Various news items, including Beyonce and Avril Lavigne, were briefly discussed, before a vulgar rant directed at a colleague named Derek concerning his sandals and bodily functions.  The show concluded with a discussion of a colleague's upcoming surgery, a morbidly humorous prediction of Ron and Fez's reaction, a comparison of their audience's behavior to Ron and Fez's, a fantasy scenario of a fight between the two shows' listeners, and promotion of a book signing and motorcycle run, culminating in plans for the next day's Philadelphia broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  In the world of radio shock jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good. 
[00:00:30]  Go screw.  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Shock show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  What?  Hold on.  Whose fault was that delay?  No.  No, is it?  Correct, open, humiliated. 
[00:01:00]  What do you mean right in front of me?  When you just end like that, I had to tie it up.  Dude, I looked at you and you went, boom, like go.  That was sloppy.  If you had to say a celebrity that you most resemble, who would you say?  Jodie Foster?  If she ate the real Jodie Foster.  Silence of the hams.  This is where entertainment is going.  I do not touch that.  The only things that may touch that is toilet paper and baby wipes.  I am right now.  The only, oh my God.  They are sick, freaks.  How close did you get to having relations with the dog? 
[00:01:30]  You have to put oven mitts on all the German shepherds so they don't scratch the watch out.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah.  Good morning.  Yeah.  There's your fake enthusiasm. 
[00:02:00]  Good morning.  How are you?  It sucks again.  Yeah.  Two seconds before we're like.  But then amazingly, right when the mics turn on.  Hey, good morning.  Good morning to you.  It's going to be a hot one.  Hot summer of the city.  Back of my neck feeling the heat is on.  The heat is on.  Hot, hot, hot.  Feeling hot, hot, hot.  Is your local news doing the hot, hot, hot song or the heat is on? 
[00:02:30]  Oh.  Well, heat wave.  Some like it hot.  Some like it hot.  When the heat is on.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, go, go, go, go.  Oh, my God.  This old gag.  Enough with the hot songs.  We get it.  Hey, I want to acknowledge the NYPD this morning.  Oh, yeah.  One of our boys went down.  That's terrible, man.  We fully support the military. 
[00:03:00]  We fully support the NYPD.  We support cops in general because obviously we're on in a lot of cities.  But, man, they still haven't caught these guys, huh?  Nah, they'll get them, though.  Believe me.  One of the boys took a .45 to the face and he's paralyzed.  They're amazed that he's even alive.  Jesus.  His partner got saved by his vest.  Apparently, they're pulling over a BMW SUV and walking up to the windows. 
[00:03:30]  Just got unloaded on.  Just got unloaded on.  You know what pissed me off about this whole thing?  I'm watching the coverage.  And they do the serious, you know, police officer down, shot, you know, paralyzed, .45 to the face.  And then also they went into, and coming up, New York CSI, and what techniques they're going to use to try to catch these guys.  Yeah, they have to make it like an entertainment. 
[00:04:00]  They went into entertainment mode.  It's like, dude, you know.  Just report the goddamn news.  The cop is down.  But there are video cameras all over the place.  Supposedly, supposedly, these hooligans, these animals, you know, they got video of them.  Yeah.  Because they were in a church's fried chicken, and then there was a video surveillance camera on the scene, I believe.  Yeah.  So I'm amazed they don't have them yet, but I'm sure they're closing in.  Well, they got a suspect.  They got a name. 
[00:04:30]  Apparently, he's some guy that was working at a car dealership, a BMW car dealership, and I guess helping himself to the goods.  And he's under this special kind of probation that extremely violent people are under.  Why isn't he in prison?  He's out there just so he could shoot people, shoot cops in the face.  Oh, do I just, oh, God, please, give the police officers a bit of liberty when it comes to getting these guys and, you know, maybe tuning them up a little bit. 
[00:05:00]  And maybe they can use a little tune-up at the station house before everything goes on the record.  Because that's just awful.  And, you know, we have a death penalty in New York, but we haven't used it since they reinstated it, what, 48 years ago?  Of course.  How long ago at this point?  I think it's been forever ago.  I think it's close to 10 years, right?  Yeah, when Pataki came in. 
[00:05:30]  I think they reinstated the death penalty here in New York close to 10 years ago.  And, you know, obviously, when they catch these animals, they won't get the death penalty.  No one gets a death penalty.  It just looks good.  It gets people voting for you.  But you don't have to actually use the thing.  So why have it?  Why bother?  They should be killing people every day of the week.  They should have death penalty Tuesdays.  Death penalty Tuesdays. 
[00:06:00]  That would be nice.  There's something I could get behind.  Death penalty Tuesdays.  If you're going to have the death penalty, use it.  Yeah.  Death penalty came back September 1995?  Yeah.  Almost 12 years that we haven't executed anyone in New York.  It was after they threw Cuomo out of there, put Pataki in.  So he signed it and went through his entire term, a couple of terms, without it being used.  And now with Elliot Spitzer in there, forget about it. 
[00:06:30]  Elliot ******, sir.  That's what I call him.  Elliot ******.  Oh, man.  Sir.  New York is becoming soft.  Is that true?  Go back to that page.  Number of executions before 1976.  Anthony, how many people do you think we killed with the death penalty before 1976?  Before 76?  Before they took it away from us for about 20 years.  I would say we loaded up with probably 62.  62 people executed since before 1976 in New York State? 
[00:07:00]  Just throwing a random number out.  Try 1130.  God bless New York before 1976.  Here we are at another execution.  We better not brag too much or Texas is going to call and go, hey, dude.  Yeah.  We do that on a weekend.  Texas made it look silly.  When George W. was over there, he made it look silly.  Yeah.  Is that true?  Wow.  That seems very high.  Wonderful.  And they used old Sparky back then. 
[00:07:30]  Strap him into old Sparky.  Watch his head smoke.  Wait, what was that other step?  Remember to moisten the sponge.  Hey, look.  We have Texas beat.  Number of executions before 1976.  Texas only had 755.  In your face, Texas.  In your face.  In your face.  In your face.  In your face.  In your face.  I'm going to paint my face.  Number of executions since 1976 for Texas.  This is a surprise. 
[00:08:00]  Only 400?  Just under 400?  Yeah.  I think it's because they didn't go through the judicial system in Texas.  Right, right.  If they thought someone was guilty of something, there would be a lynching or a shooting or something  like that.  Yeah.  They'd keep it out of the courts.  Why tie up the courts with something as trivial as people's lives?  Wow, we were animals in New York for a while.  Oh, that's great.  Before 1976, 1130. 
[00:08:30]  Don't let those parking violations build up.  You could be strapped into old Sparky.  You don't want to see your family crying as your ankles and heads smolder for a good  20 minutes.  See, we don't have this quite down yet.  Ah, yeah.  This isn't 1976 music.  I was thinking 1976 for this.  But it's before 76.  I'm sure they didn't chalk them all up in 76.  We were celebrating the bicentennial in 76. 
[00:09:00]  I'm sure many of these executions took place in the 30s and 40s.  What did you do?  Nothing.  We think you killed someone.  Into old Sparky you go.  Just zero evidence.  What kind of forensic evidence did they have back then?  Ah, who cares?  They were guilty of something.  That looks like it could be a fingerprint.  Fire up old Sparky.  He'll get the truth out of you.  So, obviously, since 1976, New York State, zero. 
[00:09:30]  Zero point zero zero.  We went from kicking ass.  Oh, yeah.  To just nothing.  Who beats us?  Who beats New York before 1976?  Now, that's what I need to know today.  Oh, yeah.  Go through the states.  I would say.  Let me try to take a guess.  Let me take a guess.  It's got to be a southern state.  Well, Georgia's up there.  Ah, Georgia's up there. 
[00:10:00]  950, but New York has them beat.  Of course, this is before 1976.  Oh.  What state you want to try?  What state?  What state?  Florida?  It's before 76.  Ah, Florida stinks.  What about, you know, how about we head out west and go to California?  Oh, boy.  Pretty liberal, though.  Ah, we got them beat.  Are we number one before 1976?  I want the big styrofoam number one finger that just has, like, electric bolts going through 
[00:10:30]  it.  And I want to know what state is, not counting Alaska and Hawaii.  I still don't acknowledge them as states.  They can't win anything.  No, they can't be involved with this.  No.  Find the lowest and find the highest, D-Rock.  You got a job today.  Lowest has to be, like, Rhode Island.  Or stupid Maine.  Connecticut.  Go to Maine.  Go to Maine.  Connecticut.  Maine, 21 before 1976.  Yes, D-Rock?  Oh, wait.  Let me get you on there.  Go ahead, E.  So far, New York has beat the entire western part of the country. 
[00:11:00]  All right.  All right.  So maybe we did have a problem.  Kick an ass piece of the Mississippi.  Maybe we did have a problem.  We needed to take the responsibility out of our hands.  One execution.  What state had one execution before 1976?  Wisconsin.  Wisconsin.  Stupid cheese heads.  They don't want to hurt anybody.  They just want to make cheese.  That's okay.  And root for their packers.  We just watched the pack.  Hey, go pack, go.  Go pack, go. 
[00:11:30]  Go pack, go.  Oh, God bless New York before 1976.  But then we just fell off the map.  Yeah.  Not once since 1976.  Oh, here's a biggie.  Who?  P.A.  Pennsylvania.  P.A.  Pennsylvania.  10.  10.  I was going to say 1040.  1,040.  Wow.  1,040.  But number of execution since 1976.  Three.  God is a nation.  What happened in 76?  Than?  Little. 
[00:12:00]  I believe there was a nationwide moratorium.  Oh, right.  On executions while they figured out if it was constitutional.  All that stuff.  Constitutional.  Oh, my God.  The feds stepped in and ruined the state's fund again.  Oh.  All right.  No one's beating New York before 1976.  Let's go back to the old days.  I call them the good old days.  Let's go to Max in Dallas.  What's up, Max?  Hey, what's going on, boys? 
[00:12:30]  I think you got your info.  That 400 was last week down here in Texas.  400 a week.  Can you imagine that?  Hey, by the way, we used to be hurt in Dallas, and, you know, they decided they knew what they were doing,  and they took us off that station in Dallas.  Yeah.  And I've been keeping close tabs on that station since they took us off.  They are in the toilet.  Good.  Yes, they are.  We got screwed twice.  Not only did we lose you guys on KOLI, then when you had your little, shall we say, month vacation. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  I lost you twice, and I had Nimrod saying, why don't you sit there and listen to it on your computer?  Yeah, because I'm going to strap my PC to my back when I'm at work, dumbass.  I love Max.  You guys have a good one, man.  All right.  Yeah, that station's in the toilet, though, Anthony, since they got rid of us.  Ah, they know what they're doing, though.  They should all get the death penalty.  Hey, speaking of the death penalty, nothing beats China, though. 
[00:13:30]  What was that story you were checking out this morning?  Oh, it's classic.  What, some guy was chewing gum or something, and they decided he had to be killed?  They take their death penalty and their government very seriously in China.  Yeah.  Don't screw around.  It seems the head of, like, their equivalent of the FDA.  You know, we get the head of the FDA here, supposed to make sure our food and drugs are  all on the up and up for the protection of the people.  And if they screwed up here, the guy would probably be reprimanded and fired from that position. 
[00:14:00]  Well, in China, the head of their FDA screwed up.  I guess there were some health concerns with some food or whatnot, and they executed him.  Really?  Bravo, China.  Like, they don't take any guff over there in China. 
[00:14:30]  Could you imagine, in this country, a government official going like, hey, I screwed up, and  they just haul you away and lop your head off or something?  That's fantastic.  Hey, it keeps everybody in line, though.  Keeps them honest.  You know.  Oh.  God bless that communism.  It works sometimes.  Wow.  Is that true?  Yeah, I'm getting some very sad news for New York.  Like, Virginia is the new leader.  Old Virginia.  Number of executions before 1976. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, yeah.  They had some fun down there.  Yeah.  1,277.  Nice.  Goodbye, New York.  Good day, sir.  But here's the problem.  Since 1976, Virginia?  98.  That's it.  But at least they're still running.  That's the new one.  Gotta be Texas.  Yeah?  Oh, and I bet it's Texas.  Texas is 400.  Texas is 400 since 1976. 
[00:15:30]  Since 76.  All right.  That's pretty good.  Oh, there was a biggie.  There was a biggie.  Arkansas?  Yeah.  Arkansas?  What the hell are they doing down there since 1976?  478.  Wow.  Wow.  All right, anyway.  Louisiana.  But all kidding aside, man, this, you know, we want to acknowledge the NYPD today.  One of their boys shot in the face, what, point-blank range with a .45.  Yeah, he's walking up a window. 
[00:16:00]  And they're looking for Dexter Bostic.  Young guy.  Dexter Bostic is on the front page of the paper.  Yeah.  Find this man.  There's Dexter, all right.  Ugh.  And it was Herman Yon, right, who's in critical condition, paralyzed?  No.  Huh?  No, he's the guy that was outside the car.  Actually, he got shot in the arm and the chest, but his vest stopped it, and he returned fire.  So it is Russell?  Yeah.  Yeah, Russell's the one in critical condition. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, that's...  Paralyzed.  Shot to the face with a point-blank range with a .44.  That's ridiculous.  And there you go.  And we have a death penalty, and it will not be used in this case.  No, of course not.  I'm sure it'll end up drugs, all these poor guys, horrible youth.  When they grew up, it was terrible.  Please.  And then they should strap him in an electric chair on their lawyer's laps, and then get 
[00:17:00]  old Spocky fired up again.  The lawyers that defend this scum.  I know it's part of our system, and they need the lawyers, but you know something?  Sometimes you don't.  Yeah.  Sometimes there's just video evidence.  There's enough evidence where you know it's the guy.  And in those cases, ah, don't waste our money.  Let the cops take him in the back and do what they do best.  And follow China's lead. 
[00:17:30]  Justice.  Follow China's lead.  Yep.  The Chinese are coming.  They're taking over the world, slowly but surely.  That's it.  Well, of course, they don't like if you punch up, you know, Google on the internet.  You might get your head chopped off, too.  But, you know, you gotta find a happy medium.  You gotta take the good with the bad.  You gotta find a happy medium between maybe corrupt government officials getting their heads  cut off, and somebody looking at a nudie picture on the internet.  Yeah, well.  Or Falun Gong.  It is.  Falun Gong.  It is crazy, because the Chinese, they execute this guy for, what was this again? 
[00:18:00]  Bad meat?  I don't know.  What did he do, Than?  It's just, they've had so much scandal with their products recently, and tampering.  They just, you can't mess with their money.  That's basically what it is.  It's amazing that this communist government has become so protective of money, and they're  really getting to the point over there in China where money is more important than this  ideology of communism, which used to be why they would kill people, you know, against 
[00:18:30]  the government.  Now it's all about the ducats.  So basically, bad meat or bad food, you die.  And in America, you shoot a cop point-blank range, and you will live.  And because you're a poor guy, you'll end up in prison, which just becomes a way of  life.  All right, well.  So you're just, you're a hero.  He'll go into prison a hero for shooting a cop, and you know, it's disgusting. 
[00:19:00]  All right, so our thoughts go out to Russell and his family there.  Russell Timoshenko, something like that?  Yeah.  Timoshenko.  All right, we got lots to do today.  Jim Norton's not here.  You don't hear his voice because he's becoming a big, big star right in front of our eyes.  His book is being released today, Happy Endings.  Make sure you go out and get it.  Yes.  It's at all the bookstores.  Jimmy's book.  It's probably the most disturbing cover I've ever seen as far as a book goes.  Yeah, it's pretty bad.  As far as legit books go. 
[00:19:30]  Jimmy's completely nude on a massage table with just a washcloth.  Barely.  Covering up his private area.  Then you got this fat broad.  Yeah.  This chubster with just a very heavy, heavy eyeshadow and heavy makeup and greasy hair.  She's obviously the massage therapist, and she's lifting up the tiny little washcloth to see what Jimmy's packing.  I had to unveil.  Oh, there we are.  And she's chuckling.  See, they're promoing his spot, Opie, right now on the news. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  And all I see is us.  Yeah, Jimmy is going to be pissed.  Jimmy is going to be so livid.  They're talking about their guest, Jim Norton, promoting his book.  Well, that's where I was going with this.  Yeah, so his book is out today, and he's going to be on Jill TV, actually.  Channel 11 here in New York, but we call it Jill TV.  Because of the lovely Jill Nicolini.  Right, and they're promoting it like crazy, Jim Norton's appearance on Channel 11, which is going to be within 20 minutes.  So if you're in the New York area, you can check it out.  We'll try to play the audio here for everybody. 
[00:20:30]  And to promo Jimmy's appearance on Channel 11, Jill TV, they're showing a montage of Anthony and I.  Yeah, not one even fleeting glimpse of Jimmy in any of those clips.  It is nothing but O&A clips, some of them eight years to ten years old.  Yeah, great.  So now I'm going to get people telling me, wow, are you sick?  No.  What happened?  No, the video you're seeing on TV was eight years ago.  And I got to mention, by the way, Jill Nicolini today is wearing a Valentine's Day teddy. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  This is something that you give your girlfriend on Valentine's Day, and she keeps it on for about ten minutes before you just ravage her sexually.  Yeah.  She looks gorgeous in that.  It's meant to be just torn off the girl's body.  Oh, please.  It's meant to be worn once.  Is that edible?  I think it's made out of the same material as a fruit roll-up.  I think the whole news department's going to cut it into pieces, and they're all going to have that in her outfit this morning. 
[00:21:30]  Just lovely.  I wonder if she'll be doing the interview with Jimmy.  No.  She really should do that.  No, Emily, the entertainment girl's in today.  Damn it.  No.  But, yeah, Jill TV is just terrific.  We've been keeping track of Jill TV for a while now, and we put the stills up on our website.  You get to see Jill and her outfit as she does this traffic thing every day.  Yep.  And since we've been keeping track, not the same outfit.  She has not even put the same thing on twice, huh? 
[00:22:00]  No, and it's been well over a month, so we're looking at at least 30 different outfits already.  30 different outfits.  And they all look like lingerie.  It's stripper wear, basically.  You think she goes to that stripper store?  Yeah.  And just picks up stuff?  So go to our website and, you know, check it out for yourself.  It's Jill TV, and then Lil' Jimmy Norton's going to be on Jill TV or Channel 11 here in  New York in about 15, 20 minutes.  Yeah.  But make sure you go out and get Lil' Jimmy Norton's book. 
[00:22:30]  It's called Happy Endings.  You can't miss it because the cover is deeply disturbing.  Jimmy's a really good writer.  Very funny.  You really get into his situations that he gets himself into, and he's just...  It's some of the sick crap you've heard on the show, but great detail and his witty writing.  I read half his book so far.  Yeah.  After scanning the whole book to see where he mentioned us. 
[00:23:00]  I'm scanning along, and out of context, I read, in a rest area, Opie's an 11, and I'm  a 3.  And I'm like, what is this about?  And I'm not even going to tell you what that is about.  You're going to have to pick up the book for yourself.  I'm like, give it a read.  He's all bummed because, well, basically, we drove up to Boston, and Jimmy has the smallest  bladder.  He has the bladder of, like, a sparrow or something.  A little hummingbird.  A hummingbird.  And he has to stop at every rest area to take a leak. 
[00:23:30]  And I joined him into the bathroom on a few of these occasions, and he was all excited  that I was going into the bathroom with him because it increased his odds or something.  I don't know what he was getting at.  That's like, if you go into a rest stop bathroom with you, that's like a hot chick walking into  a bar with a chick that isn't so hot.  She's still going to get picked up because she's with the hot chick.  Just opens up a conversation. 
[00:24:00]  But I don't know what Jimmy's thinking because it's a rest stop.  It's a rest area.  And it's nothing but a gentleman.  And he's bummed.  He's like, yeah, Opie in the rest area is an 11.  I'm a three.  I'm like, what is this about, man?  I don't think he wants to do anything.  He just wants to be asked.  I understand.  It's flattering.  Did you ever feel flattered if a gay man found you attractive or was you felt coming on  to you?  Would that flatter you?  I don't think a gay person has ever... 
[00:24:30]  How do you know?  Well, that's a good point.  Fella?  I guess I'd be...  I guess I would be...  I guess...  Oh, wow.  After 13 years, wow.  Time for me to wake up, I guess.  I guess in a strange way, sure, I'd be flattered.  Would you be flattered?  I don't know.  I guess.  Homo?  I don't know how to answer that.  I know.  That is an odd question because you want...  I think everybody wants to be attractive. 
[00:25:00]  You know how I just answered that in my stupid head?  I'm thinking, all right, if a fat chick that I would have no desire to have sex with hit  on me, I'd be flattered.  That's still...  But I'm not having sex with that person.  Still hetero.  I just answered your question like I would answer it as if a fat chick was hitting on  me.  Yeah, even a fat chick.  The definitive word there is chick.  I understand.  With a guy, though, it is an odd situation because everybody wants to be attractive and  liked and found attractive by other people. 
[00:25:30]  So does that go for gay men finding a straight guy attractive?  Does that straight guy think, you know, wow, that's kind of cool.  I'm flattered by it because they look for guys.  Like women looking at guys, that's how they look at guys.  So the way they're looking at you is the same way as a chick looks at you.  Yeah.  So there's where your fat chick analogy kind of does work.  I don't know.  What am I going to say? 
[00:26:00]  All right.  Jim Norton promoted in text on Channel 11.  They're using text now.  They have realized they have no video of Jim Norton for his appearance on TV this morning.  So now they're promoting it in text.  Could you have just found a few shots of the guy?  We talk about this all the time.  Even though we like Channel 11 here in New York and we call it Jill TV, they're lazy like  every other news organization.  I mean, they could have easily found like a clip of Jimmy on Lucky Louie.  Lucky Louie is a comedy stand-up. 
[00:26:30]  Or his HBO special.  There's a Jim Norton DVD out there from his half-hour comedy special they could have used.  They could have snapped a picture of him in the green room.  Anything.  Do you ever see when they actually take the camera in the green room and you kind of wave  or you're sitting there like looking at the paper and you look up and you kind of wave  and coming up is Jim Norton.  Anything.  Right.  But they showed us from 10 years ago.  Yeah.  So, all right.  Well, make sure you check out Jimmy. 
[00:27:00]  Channel 11 here in New York.  We got lots to do today.  Our phone number, 877-212-5762.  It's Rock Scream Tuesday.  They're standing by with their Rock Screams.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Indiana, Denver, Buffalo all want to get in on the Rock Scream.  It's also Hummer Tuesday.  We'll explain that.  That's a real one, man.  Oh, yeah.  Helping out the guys out there.  Preston and Steve don't help out the guys out there.  But they're kicking our ass.  Because they got a bunch of homos that listen to them, obviously. 
[00:27:30]  Homos.  They find us attractive.  Listen to Preston and Steve.  Homos.  And fat chicks.  Apparently so.  We got hot chicks.  And they're willing to give Hummers to their men.  Yes.  Because you're a fan of this radio show.  We'll explain after the break.  And also, it's Faraway Phone Call Tuesday.  The dumbest.  So far, we got a phone call from Long Beach.  Wow.  Long Island. 
[00:28:00]  Wow.  Could we at least get a call from over the horizon?  I don't want a direct line of sight to Faraway Phone Call.  Well, you know, it's not our problem with broadcasting pretty high up here in this building.  That we could actually see the person as they're making a phone call.  Yeah, they're waving from a phone booth.  All right.  Phone booth.  We'll step aside and we'll continue.  Here is this.  Opie and Anthony.  Another busy day on the Opie and Anthony show.  We're hitting the road after today's show. 
[00:28:30]  Or later on tonight, right?  Yes.  Because we got Jim Norton's book signing here in New York City at Penn Station.  Somewhere around there.  I guess there's a bookstore in Penn Station or around Penn Station.  Do we have the details on that?  Hurry, Kenny.  Hurry, hurry.  There's got to be.  Go.  Borders Bookstore, 33rd and 7th, right in front of the garden, you know, next to Penn, you  know, top of Penn Station.  At what time?  6?  6 p.m.  All right.  And I will be there for like an hour and then we're heading to Philly because we're  broadcasting live Wednesday and Thursday.  You got Keith's Wow Motorcycle Run happening. 
[00:29:00]  They're leaving from here, I guess, tomorrow morning.  Leaving from down the street over at XM.  Keith, give us a call and give the details on that.  And then we're broadcasting from YSB tomorrow and Thursday.  We're doing the wildest thing you own.  Last time we did this, we got a freeze-dried monkey with its mouth opened.  Or its mouth open.  Yeah, that was...  And then things happened to the monkey.  It's legendary in Philly radio. 
[00:29:30]  Legendary stuff.  That was a good one.  So we're bringing that bit back and we got a great prize.  We got like a huge 42-inch plasma is going to be the prize for the strangest thing we...  Holy Jesus.  ...we see while we're in Philly the next couple of days.  That's a good prize.  Where the hell did that come from?  YSP, man.  They're on it.  They're on it.  God bless YSP.  And they have like a whole, I don't know, schedule for us.  We're doing the show.  Then we're doing...  Then we're seeing how the wild motorcycle run is going. 
[00:30:00]  We're going to be at Lagoon or something like that, right?  Yeah, Lagoon.  Lagoon.  And then the GM wants to take us out to dinner.  They want us on Kid Chris's show.  It's just an all-day event for us.  I call it whirlwind.  Yeah.  It's a whirlwind tour.  Of Philly.  Yes.  I hope it's better than the last ones when we used to go down there and see where Ben  Franklin's house used to be.  Where they boxed it out.  Oh, I missed him.  With no walls. 
[00:30:30]  I missed that guy.  I know.  He had to be a tool.  With his tight slacks and his loafers.  He took us to Ben Franklin's house.  And we're like, oh, cool.  We got to, you know, see.  And I'm thinking it's going to be one of those things where you walk through the hallways  and you see, like, maybe they set up a velvet rope or even glass in front of it.  Oh, yeah.  And you look and see the famous, like, the spectacles.  What do they call those?  Monocles?  No, no.  Bifocals.  Bifocals.  His bifocals. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  That's what I wanted to see.  And maybe his kite and the key.  And maybe a chair or something.  You go, wow, Ben Franklin sat in that chair.  Ben Franklin sat right there.  It's in a vacuum-packed room or something.  And we get there, and Tim's all proud, and we're standing in the middle of this painted  floor.  And we're outside.  Yeah.  We're still outside, mind you.  We did not have to step through a door surrounded by walls.  And then on the corners, it's like a see-through house. 
[00:31:30]  There's, like, beams going up and then a roof line, but it's not covered with anything.  That's where it was.  You know, some of these landmarks you just got to give up on.  Just throw a 7-Eleven or a Wawa.  It's kind of to put a Wawa in there or something.  Nothing.  It's time to give up on Ben Franklin's house where it used to be.  No bow that he tied his ponytail in.  Yeah.  No singed kite.  Right.  Nothing. 
[00:32:00]  Time to put up a six-story condo.  Yeah.  Get your money's worth for that property.  Just put a plaque by the door.  Hey, before we built this monstrosity, Ben Franklin's house was underneath it.  You know, those plaques are whatever.  They all of a sudden will say George Washington slept here or whatever.  Yeah, that old gag.  There's one in Greenlaw.  My brother Elmo's in studio today.  And happy birthday, by the way.  Thank you very much.  It's brother Elmo's birthday.  Oh, happy birthday.  The bell tolls for me.  Near our sister's house.  Okay.  There's a historic plaque. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  And I saw it.  I've been driving by this old house for years and years.  And I caught a glimpse of what the plaque said.  And it says something like the most horrific murder in American history happened here or  something.  Get out of here, really.  Do you know what I'm talking about?  I have no idea what you're talking about.  I thought you were talking about the one where it was Washington slept there.  There's one down in Centiport.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  But this one, it had something like axe murderer.  It went by so fast. 
[00:33:00]  I'm like, wait a minute.  Wow, that's great.  I've got to check this plaque out.  This is a little different than George Washington slept here.  It's the Lizzie Borden residence.  Yeah.  It's where she took her 30 whacks.  I thought you might have.  No, I just saw the one that said that something really important happened here, but we forgot  what it was.  So there's just like a plaque there that doesn't really say much.  Oh, really?  There was one.  I forget.  It was some horrific murder.  You don't have to find that.  And they were bragging about it.  So I don't know.  Well, enough time goes by. 
[00:33:30]  The next time I drive to my sister's house, I'll take a picture and we'll throw it up on  a website.  Enough history.  Yeah.  Are they promoing Jimmy?  I don't know.  It's got to be soon, right?  Coming up.  Coming up.  Let's see.  Coming up on Shadow 11.  Jill TV here in New York City.  They're kind of showing.  There's a clip of Jimmy.  There's Jimmy entering the studio.  Now they've got a live clip of him.  Wait, is this it?  Turn him up.  Turn him up.  They're promoing him.  Huh?  That's not it.  Oh, this is them just, don't hit Jimmy with a pillow, you bitch. 
[00:34:00]  All right.  Jimmy's up next.  Jimmy is up next.  Let's not forget.  So keep listening to WISP for our visit to Philly.  We're very excited.  We haven't been down there in a while.  We figured it was time to reconnect with the Philly listeners.  Yep.  Stupid Preston and Steve are having a run of the place, which just doesn't make sense.  Someone just told me they give away ice cream.  We're giving away plasma TVs.  They have been there left with no competition. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  They're like, they can do as they please.  Yeah.  Well, we're coming back to town.  That's right.  We'll whittle your 20 share down to a 17 in no time.  Damn it.  How the hell did they get such huge numbers?  Hey, we're up for the challenge.  Beyond me.  We're up for the challenge.  Trust me on that.  It's going to get ugly.  Also, let's not forget.  We're an hour into the show and we forgot this.  We'll be right back. 
[00:35:00]  It's Rock Scream Tuesday. 
[00:35:30]  Rock Scream.  And Anthony.  This stupid thing started out as a joke, but every morning now, every Tuesday morning,  the phones are lit with people that want to do this.  Harry and Buffalo, what's up?  Listening on the edge.  What's up?  What's going on, boys?  I'd like to dedicate this Rock Scream to the traveling way that's not coming to Buffalo.  Hey, man.  I tried.  I tried.  Meow.  All right.  You're getting a rock scream. 
[00:36:00]  Get out of here.  Jesse in Denver.  Jesse.  Meow, meow.  Meow, meow, meow.  These aren't rock screams.  Jimmy's not here.  We're not going to allow this today.  Ryan in Indiana, what's up?  Meow.  We want rock screams.  It's Rock Scream Tuesday.  If this was Break the Rules Friday when we're on the road.  Yeah, yeah.  See, now we're not taking any more Rock Screams.  You blew it.  And then also, let's not forget, it's also...  It's Hummer Tuesday. 
[00:36:30]  On the Opie and Anthony show.  Ew.  Who did that hum?  That's Tim.  Oh, God.  That's disgusting.  He's right behind you.  What are you doing?  That's supposed to be a hot chick going like...  Yeah, man.  Like that.  Not...  Ah.  We have brought Hummer Tuesday back, though.  This is a real deal.  Play that again.  Huh?  Play that again.  Oh, God. 
[00:37:00]  You've got to hear that awful manly...  As soon as Jimmy's on TV, will you just pot that up and we'll stop doing what we're doing?  Here it is again.  Hummer Tuesday.  It's Hummer Tuesday.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  Nauseating.  God.  But it is the real deal.  We used to do this back in the day, and we have brought back Hummer Tuesday.  So, women...  To the women out there, I hope you're listening. 
[00:37:30]  You can help out your man.  Yeah.  He's a big fan of the Opie and Anthony show.  Just out of nowhere, give him a Hummer sometime today and go, that's because you're a fan of Opie and Anthony.  Believe me, he's not going to turn you down.  No.  He will not turn you down.  And it's going to make his life so much better.  He's going to treat you better.  He's going to go, what a good egg.  Yeah.  And then, of course, we get the little, hey, thanks, guys.  Yeah.  Thanks for the Hummer Tuesday, guys.  That's a fantastic promotion.  All right.  Screw Preston and Steve. 
[00:38:00]  I'll start listening to you guys.  You guys are giving us Hummers.  Ah, John.  Well, getting them Hummers.  I don't quite like it, but the way you said it.  Not only could it take a long time, but...  All right.  Not my cup of tea.  Everybody line up.  We'll do whatever it takes to get our audience back in Philly.  Come down to this.  While it might actually work in gaining us listeners, I don't think we have to go quite  there yet.  Line up outside the Ben Franklin house that used to be there. 
[00:38:30]  Entertainment news.  Uh-oh.  This could be it right here.  No E-Rock?  No E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  No, it's...  He's going to be the next story.  John in Jersey.  What's up?  You got a minute here.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey there, Jan.  Hey, I figured that, uh...  You know, my wife's been so good with Hummer Tuesday.  It's her birthday today, so I'm going to reverse it.  Yeah, we don't mind the reversal, actually.  Because we do have a lot of women listening to the Opie Anthony show.  Nut reciprocation is absolutely encouraged.  Yeah. 
[00:39:00]  I told you this.  She's been such a good sport.  I go to work.  Relax.  All right.  All right.  Goodbye.  Jimmy's on.  Goodbye.  And we're very glad to have him here with us.  Good morning.  Oh, hi.  Thank you.  Nice to have a guest who's used to getting up at this hour.  Yeah, this is...  I do radio every morning on Opie and Anthony, so I'm definitely used to getting up.  So you're wide awake.  It's like being on the set of my favorite sitcom, though.  We watch you guys every morning.  Yeah, this is great.  And we are like a comedy of errors on a daily basis, aren't we?  Oh, it's fantastic.  It's all traffic and hot chicks.  This place is great.  Yeah.  The guys enjoy themselves. 
[00:39:30]  I'm speaking...  I mean, I'm putting words in Craig's mouth.  All right.  So you're from Jersey originally?  Yeah.  Jersey boy, where?  North Brunswick.  Yeah.  And you have a younger sister?  Yeah, I have a younger sister.  And it's just embarrassing that my family has to see this book, so my apologies.  It's kind of, you know, gross and embarrassing.  So they didn't know about it until now?  No, they had no idea.  They felt like I was just a cute comedian, and now they realize I spent a lot of money  doing awful things on massage tables.  So they're going to disown you after this interview?  Not really disown me, but I think that they're kind of disgusted, yeah.  Interesting.  Okay. 
[00:40:00]  So I also understand that you like to collect photos of celebrities.  Some interesting choices of people.  Yes.  Tell us about Ozzy.  Big fan of Ozzy and Black Sabbath.  Yeah, I creeped Ozzy out.  Like 1997, I was stalking him at MTV, and I kept staring at him, and he kept looking at  me.  Oh, yeah, that's the photo.  And then he finally closed the door so I couldn't stare at him.  And I'm like, God, what a weirdo I must be to have made Ozzy Osbourne feel uncomfortable.  Gene Simmons, Alan Alda, I've stalked.  I do an impression of Alan Alda's arm.  Yeah?  Yeah, you're going to love this, but where's the camera? 
[00:40:30]  Right there.  Yes!  It's fantastic.  Gene Simmons, I understand that it wasn't easy to get his picture, that he had to be coerced  into it, kind of.  Well, we interviewed him at WNEW.  Yeah, that's the picture.  He's squeezing my little fat face.  And he was very nice to me, and then he blew me off in Las Vegas.  So I screamed about it on the radio.  And then I did an event in Philly, and one of the Opie and Anthony fans called him out  on it in front of 3,000 people.  So he had to hug me in front of 3,000 people.  It was really, like, kind of heartwarming. 
[00:41:00]  Would he be embarrassed to, like, be able to do that?  Oh, he was mortified.  Should he blush?  Wouldn't you be hugging me in front of 3,000 people?  He was completely creeped out.  Yeah, he was creeped out.  I would be embarrassed hugging him.  Why?  I don't know.  I just would.  Yeah, no, I like Gene Simmons.  Believe it there.  All right, so now I know your background is stand-up comedy, and you still are on the  circuit.  You were in Last Comic Standing.  Now you're on Opie and Anthony.  How did that whole thing come about in the first place?  Opie and Anthony, I was on.  I used to tour with Dice.  He introduced me to O&A.  I got arrested, went to jail for the Voyager bus back around in 2000. 
[00:41:30]  And we remember it well.  Yeah, you do.  You guys probably covered it.  So I've been on a regular ever since.  We got thrown off the air in 2002.  We've been back since 2004.  And this guy, E-Rock, kind of runs the entire Opie and Anthony show.  Ah, E-Rock!  That's pretty much why I'm back on the air now, because of him.  That's awesome.  So much fun.  All right, now tell us about your new book.  Well, it's a lot of true stories about comedy, about my first comedy, hookup with a  girl who kind of looked like Rocky Dennis.  Thank you.  Yeah, she was awful.  And, you know, a lot of stories about, you know, like I said, massage tables, you know, 
[00:42:00]  sitcom ideas I have.  And it's very funny.  It's kind of weird to come on and promote your own book and go, it's really funny, buy  it.  But it is a funny book.  Is there anything that you won't talk about?  Anything that's off limits and embarrassing for you?  No, not really.  I mean, the occasional tranny indiscretion.  You know, we have to kind of, we have to kind of, you know, we've all made that mistake.  Haven't we, fellas?  You got to kind of skip around that a little bit.  But no, I mean, that's the beauty of being a comedian.  It's like, who cares if people object to it? 
[00:42:30]  I mean, that's my job, is to just be funny about the truth and things that happen.  If people like it, they like it.  If they disagree, too bad.  Well, on that note, thank you so much for getting up even earlier and coming in.  We have a book signing tonight.  Yes, let's pick up, we'll give you all the info.  If you can pick up a copy of the book, it's in stores today.  You can meet him at a special signing tonight at the Borders at 2 Penn Plaza and July 12th  at the bookends in Ridgewood, New Jersey.  For more info, go to cw11.com and we'll give you all that info again.  And coming up the next hour after rumors of pregnancy is Nicole Richie actually getting married.  Hmm. 
[00:43:00]  Okay.  Look at Jimmy sitting there.  We come back, another check of traffic and get more out of your coffee than just...  Hey, right on, man.  Jimmy did a great job on Jill TV this morning.  I wish he was able to interact with Jill.  I'm sure he has behind the scenes.  We'll get all the skinny.  Well, now Jimmy's coming back to do the rest of the show with us.  Yeah.  So he'll be here in about a half hour.  But I heard Jill laughing really hard in the background.  Yes.  So she was totally enjoying it.  Jill TV.  Did a good job, man. 
[00:43:30]  Just trafficking hot chicks.  And then he credits E-Rock with everything.  He said he was going to do that yesterday.  E-Rock got us back on the air.  Yeah, that's very, very cool.  All right.  We got to take a break.  We have a new sweeper, too.  So it's Rock Scream Tuesday.  It's Hummer Tuesday.  This is the real deal, by the way.  Ladies, I'm serious.  I'm serious.  Sometime today, just surprise your man with a Hummer. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  That will get us more listeners.  A lot more listeners.  They'll love it.  They'll love you for doing it.  More power for us.  Great.  And Tim just marched in here with a faraway phone call Tuesday sweeper.  Faraway.  It's stupid.  Faraway phone call is stupid.  It's official, though, because now we have a sweeper.  Oh, God.  It means we can't get rid of it.  So you're stuck with it.  Those are the rules.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:44:30]  Good morning.  It's Rock Scream.  On Opie and Anthony.  I keep turning a little Jimmy Norton's mic on, and he's not here.  He's not there.  I put the PalTalk camera there, so you're getting Jimmy cam.  Yeah.  That's where people, that's exactly where Jimmy sits.  So you're getting the view Jimmy gets.  He'll be here in a few minutes.  Got Brother Elmo on the couch over there.  It's his birthday.  And he's going to shoot up live on the air today, right? 
[00:45:00]  You want me to shoot up?  Sure.  Going to shoot up?  Yeah.  He can shoot up live on the air for everybody.  Why do you want me to do it?  It's shoot up Tuesday.  I'll do it on the PalTalk camera.  PalTalk cam.  Have you ever seen this?  It's pretty good, actually.  No.  It's pretty good.  Where do you do it?  It's awesome.  Retina?  Right into the retina?  Into my toes, man.  Nice.  Yeah.  So where were we?  Oh, we were talking about Hummer Tuesday and the brand new sweeper that Tim came up with,  which is deeply disturbing. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, yeah.  It's really not going to help us, Tim.  I mean.  It should be a girl making a seductive humming noise after the actual promo.  That would be like, wow, that's sexy and hot.  Tim took the point of view of the male.  No, that's never good.  No, we understand what Hummer Tuesday is all about.  Even if it's the pleasure end of the male, where he's being pleasured, it still doesn't matter.  No. 
[00:46:00]  And it didn't sound like that, to tell you the truth, because I heard some sound effects in the background,  and why would the guy be humming on Hummer Tuesday when it's...  Oh, boy.  I'm starting to think that Tim may have let his sexuality slip out unexpectedly, a little  oopsie, as he's putting this together, man.  Yeah.  Well.  Want to hear it again?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's see it.  See, did you hear that? 
[00:46:30]  Like, there's sounds in with the humming.  That is very disturbing.  James Gumm was sexier.  Wow.  Well, he didn't stop there.  What?  He also came up with this, because it's also a far away phone call Tuesday.  Oh, how could I forget?  And Canadian Tony, what the hell is it with all the goddamn bits? 
[00:47:00]  Next, you'll be doing the 830 infected needle bit.  Is your needle infected?  I hope not.  I hope to hell not.  Terrible.  Well, at least my birth and death would be, you know, the same day, so it would be a nice  I don't think you want that.  That's a creepy thing.  Why?  You save on, like, letters and stuff on the tombstone.  They don't give you a two for one.  Just tell you things.  I think you got to, like, pay by the letter, right?  Is that morbid thinking that?  And do most people think that? 
[00:47:30]  Do you think that on your birthday?  What?  No, never.  I think it on my birthday.  Really?  I think, like, oh, God, I hope I make it through today, because I don't want my tombstone  to have the same frigging numbers on there.  But it gives something for people to talk about when they see it.  Oh, when they see it, and go, oh, look at this guy.  Look what happened.  Died on his birthday.  That'd be cool stuff, man.  Jeez.  I don't know.  It's morbid.  I don't know why I have so many morbid thoughts.  Anyway, so, Canadian Tony, I hate to tear down, like, the ninth wall here, but we're making 
[00:48:00]  fun of radio bits by doing all these bits.  It doesn't get the bit guy Tuesday, where people that don't get the bit comment on how  they don't get the bit, you jackass.  Well, here's the sweeper for Far Away Phone Call Tuesday.  Right.  It's Far Away Phone Call Tuesday!  Oh, yay. 
[00:48:30]  All right, there are so many things wrong with that.  What's wrong with Far Away Phone Call Tuesday?  What year is it?  First of all, why is he yelling?  Why don't you have...  He's got me yelling.  Why is he yelling into...  Why don't you have the same excitement as I do?  Because that's silly.  It's not.  Listen again before you react.  It's Far Away Phone Call Tuesday!  Is he yelling because he's far away? 
[00:49:00]  Yes.  But it's a phone call.  You ever talk to somebody, like, around the world?  You could just go, hi.  How you doing?  And they go, fine.  What are you doing?  Oh, nothing.  I'm in Australia.  It's beautiful here.  You know?  Do you know it's actually winter here?  Right.  Yeah.  You don't have to go, hey!  Do you hear the voice code in the background?  It's Far Away Phone Call Tuesday!  I'm using special machinery to get this phone call made!  All right. 
[00:49:30]  I do like the promo.  It does give the impression...  It's catchy, right?  See, I also have to put myself in his position thinking, how do you do a promo that shows  that the phone call's coming from far away in this modern time where it doesn't matter?  Uh, uh, uh, you just, you have great phones these days.  Uh, by taking it retro, like that.  Oh, Jesus!  I just saw that guy!  Why are you pissed?  Oh, no.  Jimmy just had a great appearance.  On TV. 
[00:50:00]  Really?  I thought that was...  I thought it was...  Why are you pissed?  We're so happy today.  We've had...  We've done a great hour of radio.  We...  I think you were great.  We simulcasted your TV interview.  We're all happy.  Because they didn't do...  Turn that frown into a smile, sir.  They didn't show the graphic of the book.  They didn't say the name of the book.  She said she wouldn't say it.  Oh, they wouldn't say the name?  They wouldn't say the name of the book.  They wouldn't say happy...  Wouldn't say happy ending.  Ending.  So I'm like, well, let me hold it up.  And she's like, we have a graphic.  So I just kind of felt like I got thrown into the bus.  That's why.  That's why I felt bad.  Because I was like, oh, man.  I was like, that must have been awful. 
[00:50:30]  It must have looked terrible.  No.  No.  Actually, it was a great interview.  You're very funny and everything.  I didn't even...  You know something?  I didn't notice.  Oh, okay.  They didn't show the book.  Oh, I figured you guys were going to kill me.  So I was so cranky coming over here.  Stop being cranky.  We've had a great hour of radio.  We're proud of you.  It was hilarious.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Gave a shout out to EROC.  The EROC responsibility thing.  And then the world was able to actually see your Alan Alda impression.  Oh, I forgot I did that. 
[00:51:00]  And seeing it is...  That put it over on me.  Oh, I feel better.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  They didn't let me get in the...  And Jill was laughing her ass off in the background.  I heard her.  She was great.  But I was going to show the cover.  I wanted to say that that was EROC in a blonde mullet wig.  I really wanted that cover.  Honestly, they should have shown the cover.  But besides that, it was great.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Thank you.  They got the info for the book signing out.  Everyone knows you got a book out.  And they should have said the title, Happy Endings. 
[00:51:30]  I mean...  How could they not say Happy Endings?  I don't know.  That could mean anything.  That's where we're at in this world, Jimmy.  It's a happy ending.  Unfortunately.  I feel better.  The book has a happy ending.  It does.  Yeah.  We got a nice energy today.  We're happy.  It's been an hour of hilarity on the radio.  And you did a great job on TV.  She was very sweet, actually.  Was she?  Yeah.  She's really nice.  She's very aware of the effects.  She came right in and said hello.  Really?  I mean, the whole staff is really cool.  They're all big fans over there.  They are.  The behind the scenes guys are all like, dude, I love the show. 
[00:52:00]  They're all really cool.  Really?  Yeah.  So she was really fantastic.  Yeah.  Did you get a picture with her?  Of course.  Where is it?  Let me see.  First.  I got to see his picture.  And this must be posted many people.  And she's aware that we're doing Jill TV every day?  I told her.  She's like, yeah, with the little hearts.  She's seen the graphics.  Oh, she saw the graphics.  Well, every day we take a picture of Jill and throw it up on our website for Jill TV.  You can check it out on our website.  What a great picture.  Yeah, let me see.  It feels good, right?  That's a great picture of Jill and Jill Nicolini.  She's got a Valentine's Day teddy on today. 
[00:52:30]  Is she hot in person, Jimmy?  Oh, she's fantastic in person.  Yeah.  Does she smell good?  Yeah, and she feels good because she's like a little, you know.  Feels good.  Well, we took a few pictures.  She took some for CW11.  So you put your arm around her?  Of course.  And you got to feel her hip?  The upper hip, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, they took like eight pictures for CW11.  Wow.  There you go.  Jimmy, it was a great appearance.  Okay, thanks.  I feel better now.  Were you filling?  No, I was too nervous.  Yeah.  Because I had coffee, so I didn't want to breathe in her face.  I'm like talking to my kids.  The doctor just started like, yeah, see?  All right, Jill, see? 
[00:53:00]  No, I just threw you coffee.  I got to talk out of the side of my mouth, see?  They should have shown the cover.  Oh, no, you guys made me feel totally better.  That was really good.  Maybe they just messed up because they're like a Mickey Mouse organization over there.  Yeah, Mickey Mouse operation.  No, what bugged me was when I came off, right?  Because I would have said the name of it at least.  Just said Happy Endings.  I wouldn't have went crazy.  And I'm like, did you guys show a graphic?  The guy's like, we'll show it online.  I'm like, well, dude, why am I on television if you're going to show it online?  I should be on the web.  Yeah, it's silly.  Why am I doing a simulcast somewhere?  You know?  You got many LOLs. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, okay.  You got people that were LOLing.  Yes!  I forgot I did that.  Oh, is that great?  I can almost do it.  I'm excited.  I just did it.  I just did it.  It was great.  Yes!  Do you see how I just made them acknowledge I was going to do an impression of his car?  It didn't fit in anywhere.  I'm going to do it.  Where's the camera?  You're like, where's the camera?  They were laughing hard behind.  You could hear the laughs in the background.  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Thanks.  And in honor of your fine TV appearance, we got Ernie in New York.  He wants to give you a rock scream, Jimmy.  It is Rock Scream Tuesday.  Ernie! 
[00:54:00]  Good morning.  What's up, Ernie?  Jim, you rocked on TV.  You sounded great.  Oh, thank you.  In honor of your great experience on CW this morning, I got a rock scream for you.  This is Gene Simmons.  Oh, yeah!  There you go.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Quite a rock scream, dude.  We better get Jimmy up to date here.  Tim has decided to do all sorts of sweepers for our radio show because it's Rock Scream  Tuesday, Hummer Tuesday, and Faraway Phone Call Tuesday.  Oh, good.  We don't need to play the Rock Scream Tuesday sweeper. 
[00:54:30]  No, no.  That's long.  His Hummer Tuesday one, you tell me what's wrong with it.  Jimmy's going to love it.  You listen and tell me where the problem is.  By the way, Jimmy, I was telling the story.  I'm halfway through your book, and I'm enjoying it.  Happy ending.  Where's the book signing today?  Because I got a little confused when they said to Penn Plaza.  I don't know that.  Yeah, it's on Borders.  I think that's 33rd and 7th.  It's right by Penn Station.  It's the Borders at 6 p.m. tonight.  And we're all going, and then we're heading to Philly for our big couple of days in Philly. 
[00:55:00]  Yes!  Philly, keep listening to YSP for all the details, but we're very excited about our trip to Philly.  Anyway, I'm going through the book, and of course I have to go through the whole book  to see where you mentioned me.  And all of a sudden I come across a paragraph.  All it says is, Opie is an 11.  Wait, in the rest area, Opie is an 11, and I'm a 3.  Do you remember we were traveling to Boston, and I kept standing next to you in the bathroom? 
[00:55:30]  Just making me uncomfortable.  But that's all I see in the book is, you know, in a rest area, Opie would be considering  an 11, and I'm a 3.  I avoided a lot of ONA stuff because I know eventually you guys are going to come out with  a book, and I just felt it would be kind of a scum move.  Yes!  Yeah, for me to do all the Opie and Anthony stories.  I did the Voyager bus.  Thank you.  But no, that's just not cool to do.  And that was why I stayed away from a lot of it, because, I mean, you guys are obviously  going to do that sooner or later.  Well, I'm doing the whole thing about E-Rock.  Yeah, there's rumors flying around about our book, yeah. 
[00:56:00]  Wait, you're doing it about E-Rock.  We should call it Fat Heads and Failed Dreams.  No disrespect, Eric.  I'm taken.  All right, here we go.  So, Tim came up with the Hummer Tuesday sweeper, Jimmy.  Just to figure out the problem.  Come on.  It doesn't feel like...  Did it, did it, did it, did it.  It doesn't feel like queuing up today.  Preston and Steve stuff queues right up.  It sure does.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, my God. 
[00:56:30]  That's why they beat us.  Here we go.  It's Hummer Tuesday.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  What's wrong with that?  Besides the fact he said hit record?  See, we're finally bringing back Hummer Tuesday.  A lot of these bits we're doing.  Yeah.  We're just making a mockery of the whole thing.  A mockery. 
[00:57:00]  But Hummer Tuesday is real.  It was great back in the day.  And when you think Hummer Tuesday, you think sexy.  Girl.  You think girl.  You think, like, slobbery.  You want to hear the sound.  You think.  You want to hear the sound of a girl maybe enjoying a lollipop.  Right.  Being recorded.  And giving a slight, sexy, bedroom-y hum.  Right.  As she's doing that.  And that's what you want.  And instead, you get this. 
[00:57:30]  It's Hummer Tuesday.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  You get a dock worker.  I'm thinking someone's sexuality slipped out.  You know what I mean?  It sounds like Lee J. Cobb in On the Waterfront.  You'll never work these docks again or get a Hummer, Kerry.  Right.  So, well, boy, I'm sure the women are just racing to their man as we speak. 
[00:58:00]  If that doesn't get you in the mood, nothing will.  Right.  And then he didn't stop there.  He came up with the Far Away Phone Call Tuesday sweeper.  First of all, I think Far Away Phone Call Tuesday is ridiculous.  And the sweeper for it, I kind of like it.  But just give it a listen.  It's Far Away.  Phone Call Tuesday! 
[00:58:30]  Jim, comment.  There he is.  Yeah, he's waving at you from the other room.  He should make a Far Away Phone Call from the unemployment line.  At Kinko's.  Yes.  What are his resume's together?  That is just...  I love that there needs to be Morse code, but you can talk.  Right.  But there's static.  But you've got to yell because you're far away.  When we eventually take our Far Away Phone Call today, we only do one or two.  Yeah. 
[00:59:00]  Notice how, like, crystal clear the reception will be.  It's going to be, hi, where are you from?  I'm calling from New Zealand.  Actually, let's go back to last week.  I think we talked to someone from Korea.  Korea.  Yeah.  And it sounded like the guy was calling from Hoboken, New Jersey.  He wasn't like, hey!  Yeah.  Hey!  Beep, beep, beep, beep!  I'm calling!  Hey!  It's 2007!  Right.  It's amazing!  By the way, someone called from Detroit for Far Away Phone Call Tuesday. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  And we had to tell them, uh, we're being hurt in Detroit.  Yeah.  The people in Detroit would find that silly.  It's not far away.  Right.  I saw someone from the UK, but they hung up.  Well, we'll get a Far Away Phone Call in the near future here.  Yeah.  By the way, we sent, uh, interns Jared and Matt, uh, down on the streets of New York  for some rock screams.  Oh.  This is just an excuse to make fun of Jared's awful body and haircut. 
[01:00:00]  Holy mother of God.  Anthony, out of nowhere, just started beating him up.  I'm like, this is, this is, this is unlike him.  I couldn't.  Bring him in.  I couldn't look at him at.  Bring it, bring in the 20-year-old disaster.  Let me tell you, if he was even 25, I would say, okay, some people at 25, you know, hit  the wall.  He's barely out of his teens.  Right.  And, and look at the swagger.  Oh, no.  The first swagger kid comes in.  Yeah, that's the Abercrombie and Fitch model. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  That we decided needs to work here for some reason.  And then there's just.  Thanks, Steve.  Jesus.  The disaster.  At 20, this kid's body should not be like this.  And people get confused out there.  You know, now you're, you're picturing out there a fat guy.  Like, you could carry fat.  You know what I mean?  People could carry fat.  They're meant to be fat and they could just carry it well.  There's something wrong with Jared.  It looks like he has like an inner tube on and he's ready to jump into a city pool. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  He's got that thing going on and his, but it's the whole package.  Like he's dumpy.  There's like this, this, like he's melting or something.  Where the hell is he?  I don't know.  Oh, he's getting coffee.  He's getting coffee.  Yeah.  Good.  Is he, he's working.  So we're going to just stop the whole radio show and wait for the intern to come in after  he gets his coffee.  I guess if he was out getting coffee, then.  Swapping him out with another intern.  What? 
[01:01:30]  We're swapping him out with another intern and bringing him back up.  He was out doing something.  He was out getting coffee.  Oh, getting actual coffee.  I thought he was getting his own coffee.  Like I'll go, I'll come down when I'm good and ready.  Oh dude.  You should have let him believe that.  They would have smashed.  Oh boy.  Would I have Starbucks?  No, I was, I was ripping him apart a little bit.  A lot of bit.  During a commercial break.  Yeah.  Because he walked in with something and I just looked at him and said, he's like a cartoon.  Like his body is like, it's been drawn because human bodies don't grow like that. 
[01:02:00]  He looks like he is like a South Park character.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like this big dumpy lower half, the inner tube around his gut.  And then he hunches over.  He's hunched over.  Like he has scoliosis.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But he doesn't.  And he walks just with his head kind of up because he's so hunched over.  So he looks up like through the top of his eyes and, and walks with his arms swinging.  But, but his palms are facing directly behind him. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  Like kind of a gorilla walk thing going on.  Yeah.  It's just, I'm, I'm stunned.  I, and it all just hit me when he walked in before and I had to just, I asked how old  he was.  I expected him to say like mid to early late twenties kind of a thing.  He's had time to let himself go.  You're just out of your teens.  What is he doing?  He walks like the Sasquatch in that footage.  Yes.  Where the horse is like, well, the guy, yeah, the guy fell off the horse and, but kept filming 
[01:03:00]  Sasquatch.  That's how he walks.  The Bigfoot's kind of waving with his big stupid arms swinging.  Yeah.  You know what, you know what, Jared?  He, he looks like his self-esteem.  Oh yeah.  If you needed a picture of his self-esteem, it's him.  He looks like his inner thoughts.  Yeah.  Mopey.  Yeah.  He's not hiding anything.  His body shows it all.  I don't picture one happy moment in that guy's life.  Well, let's go right to this as Jared comes back up from getting coffee or whatever the  hell he does for us.  Who knows?  The boys went on the streets of New York to get some rock screams. 
[01:03:30]  Rock scream Tuesday here on the Opie and Anthony show.  Walking down Fifth Avenue looking for people.  Sir.  Is that you?  Yeah.  Wow.  You're kind of over the top.  Yeah.  A little bit of caffeine that day.  He went with his radio voice.  Yeah.  You got to get on that.  That's like a classic radio voice.  Yeah.  Hey, rock scream Tuesday.  I thought that was actually a listener doing it like as a goof.  I thought he said, all right, just say rock scream Tuesday.  No.  No.  No.  No. 
[01:04:00]  Rock on!  Thank you.  That's Alicia from Canada.  That sounded like a half-assed Canadian rock scream.  All right.  What's your name and where are you from?  I'm Kristen.  I'm from Lexington, Kentucky.  All right.  Give us a rock scream from Kentucky.  Woo!  Wow.  I'm bluffing.  Thank you.  Thank you.  They did understand the concept of the rock scream.  They were very, very dumb.  They weren't.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:04:30]  Here comes Jared with his duty hat.  He's got his duty hat on.  Let's not forget he is the star of the duty hat video.  That's a...  Duty hat.  We forgot that he's the star of the duty hat video that's up on all the websites, all  the video websites.  Do you remember any of your lines?  Did someone say, big boy made a duty?  They took it off of break.com.  They took it...  Really?  Break.com had a problem with our...  Wow. 
[01:05:00]  They're usually pretty cool.  Well, we tried searching it yesterday, and it didn't come up.  Well, it's on our website, right?  Steve, it's up on our website.  So, Jared, you're just a disaster.  Yeah, Jared.  Thank you.  I really took note when you walked in before, because you were being just yourself.  There wasn't this attempt, even, to be like, to walk with your head up high, or maybe,  you know, sucking your gut or something. 
[01:05:30]  You just schlepped in here, and I looked going, what is wrong?  What is wrong?  You pretty much feel worthless, right?  Do you just...  All the time?  All the time?  Not all the time.  Not all the time.  Why do you slouch?  Why are you like...  Yeah, you're like...  I don't know.  Wait, when do you feel worthless?  Get on the mic there.  You don't even know how to talk into a microphone.  Yeah, have some confidence.  Do you feel worthless?  Not right now.  Say not all the time.  Not all the time.  What are you doing with your right arm, man?  Not all the time.  Not all the time.  His mouth is odd.  Is it?  Yeah, I was watching his mouth.  It's kind of like, not all the time.  It doesn't close. 
[01:06:00]  Not all the time.  It's like, he's so busy opening it for other reasons.  It's just kind of going to stay open.  Nobody reminds me of, I finally figured it out.  You guys ever see, like, a hypnotist in one of those hacky shows?  And in between the hypnotist having the people on stage do something, they're kind of  in that weird state of, like, kind of awake, but kind of asleep.  Oh, semi-consciousness?  That's what he looks like.  He's in a state of semi-consciousness all the time.  Yes, Kenny?  I just got to say that Jared is my go-to guy as far as interns go.  Yeah, why?  Wow.  Why?  He gets the job done? 
[01:06:30]  He's my main man.  So he's my go-to guy.  He's the guy I trust.  No, why?  Because he has the excitement of you.  You can relate to Jared.  With his duty hat on and everything.  Yeah.  No, Jared's okay in my book.  All right.  Is he your wingman, though, when you're trying to pick up chicks?  When you're trying to pick up chicks in wheelchairs?  So when did it start for you, like, this... 
[01:07:00]  This sadness.  Sadness and just your gut?  Were you always a chubby kid?  Yeah, I was always a fat kid.  Well, fat, because I said before, you're not fat.  You're just, like, you're mushy.  It looks like your upper half is slowly melting into your bottom half.  You look like a candle that's been burning a little too long.  Yeah, because if you just took a picture of your face, no one would say, that's the face of a fat guy. 
[01:07:30]  Right.  You know?  But he works out.  Yeah, you said you work out.  Yeah.  Now, what do you do?  How often?  I usually run three, four times a week.  Away from people that are trying to beat you up?  What do you run to the mailbox and back?  You run.  I have a treadmill in the house.  A treadmill.  Yeah.  Okay.  You're kind of gloomy is what's coming in on the instant feedback.  Gloomy.  He's a gloomy gust.  Did you lift up your shirt?  Like, are you wearing an inner tube, or is that just...  No.  Yeah.  Let's see the gut.  What's going on there? 
[01:08:00]  Come on.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  You have, like, belly button female part.  It's like, right from your belly button down, you actually have a cleavage.  It happens.  It happens.  He has enough skin to be 6'6".  Yeah.  You'd be perfect if you were 6'6".  Yeah, we just got to stretch you out.  You'll be fine.  Yeah.  I'll get ready on the dump. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, really?  Looks like you could...  Looks like you could have sex with that.  Yeah, it does.  Like, under your belly button is an area that really does look like...  That whole thing looks like you could get something done there.  Yeah.  It looks like a female...  Like an intimate area of a female.  Why is that?  Wow.  I don't know.  If I knew that, I'd try to solve the problem.  Like, your belly fat is divided into two separate entities that are separated at your belly button. 
[01:09:00]  Do you have an appendix scar?  No.  So, we're pointing out something that you've been self-conscious about for many years.  Yeah?  Yeah.  That's our job on this show, I guess.  Were you fatter?  Yeah, at one point.  You were?  Yeah.  All right, put your shirt down.  We're all feeling bad for you now.  Are you talking about the way...  No disrespect, but are you talking about...  Hormones changing, I'm starting to feel bad for people.  The fat kind of...  What's wrong with me?  The fat kind of like...  There's a part of the fat in the middle. 
[01:09:30]  Yes.  That's from the pants being pushed up.  Is that like that?  Lift your shirt again, not to make fun of you.  But like, is that buckle pushing the fat up into two halves, or is it like that when  you're nude?  Oh.  That's why I asked if you had an appendix scar.  Would you like a belly button like Matt?  Matt, show him your belly button.  Yeah, you want one of those, right?  For sure.  Just a little hair trail to some champion undershorts.  Doesn't make you sad to see a real belly button?  No.  No?  All right. 
[01:10:00]  All right, Jared.  All right, Jared.  I just...  I don't know.  I don't know what happened, though.  During the commercial break, Anthony just decided to go after you.  I just had a...  I feel like I felt...  I started like I wanted to help him out, and it just ended with me yelling at him.  I was just yelling at him.  Because he's 20.  For the love of God, what are you doing?  You must eat horribly.  I try to eat healthy.  How are you shaking your head now?  What are you, sit down to dinner with the guy?  What I've seen, he's been eating perfectly for the past, well, however long this internship is. 
[01:10:30]  Hey, hey, let me just swagger.  Hey, no, he's been eating perfectly.  There it is.  All the confidence in the world, and nothing.  Right next to each other.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, they're a little different, aren't they?  Wow.  Humanity.  Yeah, all right.  Just never know.  It's a mixed bag.  Well, you guys, we're on the streets of New York getting rock screams.  Let's get back to this. 
[01:11:00]  Lauren from Dallas.  I'm just looking for one lousy good rock scream from the streets of New York.  What's your name?  Where are you from?  I'm Lauren.  I'm from Dallas.  Okay.  Now you're obliged.  See?  You gave us your name.  Okay.  Ah!  You gotta do better.  Oof.  They just don't understand the concept.  No, no.  Rock scream.  We're bad.  Were you explaining to them that the whole...  Well, Jared gives her an example here.  Oh, good.  I don't know.  Give me an example. 
[01:11:30]  I'm so mortified.  You gotta do a little bit.  Oh, I'm done.  I'm done.  She's got no...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  No, I'm done.  I'm done.  I'm done.  I'm done.  I'm done.  Hope she's screaming like that later in an alley with a freaking cobblestone over her  head.  TJ from Jersey.  Opie, please stop eating Kashi.  Good friends.  For breakfast, you're losing the psycho Opie tag and becoming too nice. 
[01:12:00]  I feel like bad for this kid.  Why am I feeling bad for you?  He probably has fun.  You got friends, right?  He's got a cool rock t-shirt on.  He has a little bit of a gut.  He goes, you have friends, right?  He's a few pounds overweight.  And it's like, people do acknowledge that you're alive, don't they?  Like, if you were burning, would someone help?  That's what I'm trying to say, because, like, uh...  Yeah.  I feel like that was a little extreme.  He's not an overly fat guy.  No.  Yeah, like, the people out there in Radioland are thinking, well, we're talking about a 
[01:12:30]  real mess.  No.  Not really.  How much do you weigh?  About 200.  And you're what?  5'2"?  Oh, wow.  5'7".  5'7".  Two bills.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  You got a lot of lower weight, body weight, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe you should hang upside down every morning.  Get some of that up by your shoulders.  Yeah.  Big fat head.  Huh?  Evenly distribute it.  Well, we just need, like, a rolling pin or something. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, you're not rolled out right.  That's what it is.  A rolling pin.  Yeah.  All right.  Get out of here.  That's all we can do with you guys today.  Now, just observe the walk.  Go ahead.  Just feel free.  It's like this total...  There's the swagger.  Yeah.  And then look at this total lack of confidence.  He just schleps.  That is a schlep.  He looks like the kid that wanted to be a superhero. 
[01:13:30]  The animated...  What was that movie?  Hello?  What?  Incredibles.  Incredibles.  Yeah.  He looks like the kid that wanted to be...  You know, he was the Uber fan of...  Oh.  What's his name there?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's...  You know what Jared is?  He's the personification of lackluster.  Lackluster.  Lackluster.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Hey, they...  It's official.  They buried the N-word.  But we're going to attempt to bring the N-word back today.  They did.  We'll get into it next, and... 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  We got the news story about it.  And Kwame.  Good old Kwame from Detroit.  The mayor of Detroit.  Yeah.  He...  Kwame Kilpatrick.  Yeah.  He was quoted as saying,  Die, N-word.  Die.  Wow.  He made a statement.  Wow.  So, we'll get into that next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Jimmy had a little observation.  We're still watching Jilt TV, Channel 11, here in New York City. 
[01:14:30]  Jim had a very good interview about his book, Happy Endings, that is released today.  It's in bookstores everywhere.  I think it's funny that they wouldn't show the cover, and yet we're just watching this  showing a guy getting kicked in the groin.  Yeah.  Like a kick in the groin video, like where this guy stands there, and like five different  people come up.  We're the same guy kicking him over and over.  There was a couple of different guys coming over and kicking him, and it's like a YouTube  video.  That's what they're doing.  Look, they just went off the air for a second.  They're just a mess.  They're just a cluster F. 
[01:15:00]  Wow.  They had that old school where off the air.  Yeah.  Woo.  Traffic.  The thing that used to come on at two in the morning.  Yeah, yeah.  When the station would go off the air.  But it's a YouTube video.  It has, what is it, a yoga thing?  Yeah, it's some guy that says through the power of his mind he can eliminate the pain.  Some kind of martial art.  And it helps his sex life.  But here's the problem, and the news will not point this out, and I'm sure you've seen  the video by now.  It's pretty much the video of the day. 
[01:15:30]  He's not really getting kicked in the nuts.  No.  No.  He's getting kicked like in the area between there and the dirty spot.  That's what the guy's foot is doing.  He's kind of curling his foot around, you know?  Right, he's getting kicked in such a way, I mean, no one would be brave enough to even  go for this type of kick, but he's not getting hurt because he's not getting his area kicked.  No.  He probably has a fetish for it, actually.  There's guys that like that, he probably has a fetish for it. 
[01:16:00]  Funny you should say that, Jimmy.  Back at N.E.W., we had that guy come in and get nailed in the old, you know what.  Well, not that guy, a guy with a fetish.  Right.  A guy with a fetish.  Right, a different guy.  And remember the grandma that kicked him?  Yep.  Do we have a bit of that?  All right, really fast, because Jimmy mentioned it.  Here we go.  This guy, well, I think we explained it.  Go.  Two guys getting kicked hard, right in the crotch, with no protection. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, that got him.  Oh, that got him.  If he wasn't chained up, he would have fallen down.  Oh, this is not right.  Oh, that's it.  That's got him again.  Oh.  That's got to be it.  Yeah, that's got to be it.  Oh, my God.  All right, let's see if we can't get a good kick in from Grandma.  Grandma is lining up.  Oh. 
[01:17:00]  Oh.  That's got him.  He's down.  He's down.  He's down.  You don't talk Grandma like that.  Come on.  She got the bullseye.  Grandma still got a chance, right?  Let's hear it for Grandma.  Grandma, put him down.  That's.  Yeah.  There's your fetish, Jimmy.  I remember that Grandma wound up and just kicked him as hard as she could with her orthopedic  shoe. 
[01:17:30]  All right.  But they buried the N-word, everybody.  Yeah.  Apparently, we talked about a little yesterday before the ceremony.  And I guess they have the ceremony.  Actually, in a cemetery, there's going to be a headstone.  I guess.  Way to make a mockery of the whole thing.  And way to give the word a lot more power, by the way.  This could be the dumbest idea ever.  Like we said, there's so many other things that really need to be addressed besides this 
[01:18:00]  fake funeral for a word.  What is that accomplishing?  I don't know.  Why not address guys that shoot cops and eat Popeye's chicken?  Yeah.  That shoot cops in the face.  With a .45.  Yeah.  Where's Al?  Where's Al?  I'm not sure Al's in hiding until the next shock jock says something a little edgy.  Yeah.  Because that's dangerous.  That's way more dangerous than what happened here in New York City. 
[01:18:30]  Point blank range guy takes a .45 to the face.  Routine traffic stop, basically, is what it started as.  Yeah.  They didn't even get to the point of asking for a license and registration, really.  They walked up to the door.  Boom.  That's it.  Where's Al?  Where's Al today?  Where's Al when it comes to the real issues?  Yeah.  Anyway, they buried the N-word.  What do you say, Al?  Nothing.  Where do you think Al goes when these really tough stories hit the paper? 
[01:19:00]  He doesn't care.  You think he goes down to the Caribbean?  But he's got to hide.  I mean, you know, because I'm sure there are enough people out there that are actually going,  Hey, Al, hello.  Did you see the front page of the paper today?  You know what he says?  It's not my problem.  They have people that, you know, stick up for them.  I only go to the hospital beds of the people that the cops shoot.  Yeah.  You know, those upstanding citizens.  Yeah.  He would say something like that.  Like, well, while our condolences go out to the families of those officers, you know, 
[01:19:30]  our young brothers.  And then he would take it right back into that.  Exactly where he'd take it.  Right.  Exactly.  Not to change back to what we were just talking about, but Chuck in Jersey, this is very important.  Chuck, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  How you doing today?  All right, man.  You guys talking about people getting shots in the nuts, man.  I'll tell you, I'll come up there tomorrow morning and I'll take one and then it'll...  Oh, your phone crapped out.  But you'll take a couple shots to the groin?  Yeah, sure.  Yeah. 
[01:20:00]  Why the hell not?  Well, we're broadcasting from YSP tomorrow morning.  Oh, well, far away.  I'd have to come up.  All right.  Well, we'll be back in New York, what, Friday?  You can come in Friday and we'll do it.  That'd be fine.  Yeah, set it up.  What time I got to be there?  I get off work at six.  Is this one of your fetishes?  What's that?  Is it a fetish?  No, no.  I just don't care.  I take pain.  I like pain in general.  I'm damn near impervious to it.  You want a girl to do it? 
[01:20:30]  You want a girl or E-Rock?  Your choice.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Jimmy can kick me.  Anthony can kick me.  No, I ain't.  Don't kick me.  No, we got too much to lose.  All right.  E-Rock has nothing.  We'll throw him under the bus for this.  All right.  Hold on to the line.  We'll try to figure this out.  We got to get a girl that knows what she's doing when it comes to that little fetish.  Okay.  They buried the N-word.  Let's get into this a little bit.  Yes.  The NAACP has buried the N-word. 
[01:21:00]  And it was buried in a pine box.  There was no mourning at this funeral.  No.  Hundreds of onlookers cheered Monday as the NAACP.  What?  What?  Huh?  What?  Hundreds of onlookers cheered.  No, no.  What was the sentence before that?  There was no mourning at this funeral.  None, huh?  Well, some people may have mourned in private. 
[01:21:30]  Did they ask Salvi?  Did they ask some of the people?  Yeah.  No mourning whatsoever, huh?  Not a one, huh?  Apparently not.  Not a one.  Not as per this report.  Really?  Hundreds of onlookers cheered Monday as the NAACP put to rest a longstanding experience  expression of racism by holding a public burial for the N-word during its annual convention.  Along the way, two Percheron horses, is that it? 
[01:22:00]  Percheron?  Only you care.  Couple of horses.  Pulled a pine box adorned with a bouquet of fake black roses and a black ribbon printed  with the derivation of, with a derivation of the word.  Yeah.  What does that mean?  Is it the actual word?  I don't know.  Or derivation thereof?  I don't know.  It'd be funny, though, if someone just saw that on the coffin and went, ah, the fella  must have died. 
[01:22:30]  He just saw that.  Oh, gee.  Wow, they must not have liked him.  Got it.  I guess he died without any ID on him.  Oh.  Wow.  Oh, jeez.  Oof.  Poor fella.  The coffin is to be placed at Detroit Memorial Park Cemetery and will have a headstone.  Yeah.  Today, we're not just burying the N-word. 
[01:23:00]  We're taking it out of our spirit, said Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick.  Yeah.  We got audio.  You got to hear this.  You got to hear this.  All right.  It was a symbolic funeral for a slur with a polarizing past.  One intended to lay the N-word to rest.  The NAACP organized the procession in downtown Detroit, which was led by two horses and a  pine box. 
[01:23:30]  Today, we're not just burying the N-word.  We're taking this out of our spirit.  We're taking it out of our being.  We're taking it out of our minds.  Today, we ban it dead.  Was that Kwame?  Yeah.  That is-  That's the mayor of Detroit, Kwame?  That's the mayor.  Nice.  Of Detroit.  Kwame.  That's all he had to do yesterday, huh?  It's dead.  It's take place in this silliness.  Try to say it. 
[01:24:00]  See?  It's dead.  See?  Told ya.  The group has been campaigning against the casual use of the word, an epithet inexplicably  intertwined with slavery in America.  It's just wrong.  The slaves got treated like that, and we don't want to be treated like that, and we don't  want to go backwards, back into slavery.  We're not going to speak this way about each other.  You know, could they teach kids something, that that isn't going to happen? 
[01:24:30]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  We're not going to go back into slavery?  Did they teach children that that isn't going to happen?  It's just going to perpetuate bad feelings when the adults of these children-  It's just as bad as that Prussian blue band, the two girls that are white supremacists.  That right there, what that kid was saying, is just as bad.  It's, and you know it's their parents, or parent, or grandparents, filling them full  of that kind of ideology, thinking that, you know, that the white man is trying to bring 
[01:25:00]  back slavery, and they're not going to take it.  Believe me.  White men ain't trying to bring back slavery.  It was up to us.  Never would have had it in the first place.  How about that?  I'm willing to go out on a limb and say that.  What do you mean?  Yeah.  Don't think it was a good idea.  White people did, you have to, white people did kind of have a hand in the slave trade.  I understand.  I think if, you know, if it was up to me, I don't think there should have been any slavery 
[01:25:30]  whatsoever.  Are you feeling okay today?  Yeah.  Oh, all right.  Why?  I was wondering.  None of the slavery, none of the boats, nothing.  Wait a minute, I, okay.  That's all I'm saying.  Slavery was a bad thing, and never should have been brought to this country.  Do you need some aspirin?  No, I feel fine.  Do you need to take your temperature?  I feel fine.  I don't think you need to take your temperature.  I feel fine.  Or, you know, because you're not saying that because if certain things didn't happen, then  this country would be all white right now. 
[01:26:00]  It'd be boring.  Well, you could say that.  I don't, I think you're speculating.  I think through immigration, in its natural course, I think we'd have plenty of African-American  people living in this country.  I just, you know, don't think the ancestors of slaves have that same spirit of the immigrants  that would have come over. 
[01:26:30]  They wouldn't feel, you know, persecuted and whatnot because slavery was a bad thing.  It was horrible for them.  Horrible living conditions.  Just an awful thing.  And like I said, if it was up to me, never, ever would this country have accepted slaves,  sent ships over there, and brought slaves over here.  Just wouldn't have happened.  Not on my watch.  Not on my watch.  Let's go to Amita or Amanda. 
[01:27:00]  Long Island.  What's up?  Amita?  What's up, Amita?  Hi.  I just wanted to know, because I've never been to Detroit, is it really that boring and  there's no crime and no other real issues where they take the time out to bury a word?  It looks like the mayor wanted a little publicity.  He, you know, he got his face on TV all over the country because of this dumb ceremony they  did.  So stupid.  You know that many people for the NAACP would not have shown up to the funeral of a shot 
[01:27:30]  cop?  And that's what's irritating.  Yeah, how about that?  I understand it's an awful word and people don't want to use.  Like, yeah, okay, I understand that.  It's terrible.  But to go through this symbolic nonsense and then, you know, again, something like this  happens and the NAACP doesn't say a word.  Right.  They don't really address black-on-black crime at all.  They just address this idiotic symbolism.  Yeah, they don't address the real issues.  Were any of the rappers who use it frequently there attending?  Probably not.  Of course not. 
[01:28:00]  It says here the N-word has been used as a slur against blacks for more than a century.  It remains a symbol of racism, but it also is used by blacks when referring to other  blacks, especially in comedy routines and rap and hip-hop music.  Exactly.  So what was the point of this whole thing?  Amita, how black are you?  I am African-American.  Yeah.  We're good at hearing the voices.  Yeah.  We're good at hearing the voices. 
[01:28:30]  We got this weird radar.  We know.  Yeah.  We know when we're talking to a black listener.  How dark, though?  Like, are you, like, Halle Berry?  Like, who was that artist, that really black artist?  What's her name there?  Erykah Badu?  Nah, Badu's a little darker than Halle Berry.  The one from back in the day, and she was in, uh...  Esther Roll?  Nah, Esther Roll's pretty dark, yeah.  James! 
[01:29:00]  No, the one with Arnold.  Oh, man, Jay, Jay.  With the short haircut, the, uh, uh, Grace...  Grace Jones.  Grace Jones.  Oh, wow.  Are you as dark as Grace Jones?  No, I'm not.  How dark are you?  Grace Jones.  Um, maybe, uh, especially now that it's summertime, it usually is darker than Halle Berry's collection.  You guys really, uh, get a little darker in the summer, huh?  Yes, I can.  I can't.  Where we're learning.  Where we're learning, I don't know.  All right, Amita, thank you.  Thank you.  She says, is, uh, Detroit that morning? 
[01:29:30]  We should ask Detroit.  We're on in Detroit.  We've never had a phone call from Detroit, so...  So I guess...  I guess they're hearing us right now.  The Reverend Otis Moss III, his assistant pastor at Trinity United Church of Christ,  there in Chicago, said in his eulogy,  uh, this was the greatest child that racism ever birthed.  The N-word.  The N-word.  Yeah.  All right.  We're not going to speak this way about each other.  We're not going to do this N-word business anymore. 
[01:30:00]  It's time to stop.  There's also been criticism within the African-American community,  particularly focused on rappers who use the N-word casually in their lyrics.  Oh, by the way, uh, yeah, and they'll continue, by the way.  That's not going away.  Oh, yeah, stop.  That's not going away.  All right.  Let's go to Rob in New York.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Rob.  Hey, who gave the eulogy?  Who gave the eulogy for the N-word?  Yeah. 
[01:30:30]  Your door's open.  Your door is ajar.  Right.  Let's leave it at that.  Let's go to Mike in Buffalo.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, last time I checked, isn't Detroit like the unofficial murder capital of the country?  Well, I think D.C. is, but, uh...  Yeah, D.C. is, uh, way up there.  You don't think I've got better things to do?  I mean, you don't see everybody complaining about, you know,  when the single-celled amoebios made fun of the double-celled amoebios.  I mean, we'll go back all the way in history to every time somebody had hurt feelings. 
[01:31:00]  I mean, oh, my God.  Well, I think the point is, sir, to play devil's advocate,  a point with that word is that people feel like black people are, like,  the only ones that refer to each other by a racial slur.  Like, you don't really hear Irish doing it.  You don't hear the Jews doing it.  You don't hear, uh...  The Irish will do it occasionally.  Occasionally, but it's not, like, a socially acceptable thing.  It's not...  It doesn't permeate their whole social interaction.  And I think that's probably the point, that word,  is you don't hear Puerto Ricans saying, you know, 
[01:31:30]  people just don't do it.  Asians don't do it.  So maybe that's where that word is kind of weird.  It's kind of unique to black people in that way.  Yeah.  Well, whatever happened to sticks and stones, you know?  I mean, that's what my grandma taught me.  Jeez, if we could only be that simple.  God bless my...  What are you, eight?  Yeah, sir.  Settling things like an eight-year-old.  You know, whatever happened to sticks and stones?  There's a line between, let's bury this word,  and I'm rubber, you're glue.  I'm sorry.  There's a happy medium. 
[01:32:00]  What is sticks and stones?  They break my bones?  You can see them get up at the U.N.  I'm enacting the sticks and stones policy here.  Right.  You are.  Once done that in years.  Our parents have yet given us names,  and the N-word is not our name,  and people who feel like they need to say that  are wrong for saying that.  It's a funeral that comes on the heels  of several high-profile, racially insensitive remarks.  In November, Seinfeld actor Michael Richards  repeatedly used the N-word 
[01:32:30]  during a Los Angeles comedy routine.  And three months ago,  radio talk show host Don Imus  used other insulting slang words  to describe the Rutgers University  women's basketball team.  The coffin will be placed  in Detroit's Memorial Park Cemetery  with a headstone marking its symbolic contents.  Oh, my God.  What's going to be written?  Is it going to say N-word,  or is it going to be the real word?  It's going to say N-word.  You know that.  It's just going to say N-slash-word?  The bear can't be behind an actual tombstone 
[01:33:00]  that has the word on it.  That would be his story.  Imagine the surprise, though.  You're just walking through the cemetery,  and you're looking and going,  get out of here.  We're going to get out of here.  Is that what I think it says?  I don't know.  See, that's a question  that needs to be answered.  A lot of people are probably curious.  Oh, we're going to have an update  on this story within a week.  The coffin was, you know, unburied.  They dug it up.  Oh, yeah.  Tombstone is missing. 
[01:33:30]  That tombstone is the collector's item.  Or it was spray-painted  with the real word on the tombstone.  You watch.  Oh, you watch.  Why go through all this hoopla?  Yeah, I don't know.  It really is just,  and I don't like the fact  that it was spurned by two entertainers.  That's what annoys me.  It's such a stupid way  to get motivated.  Michael Richards and Imus,  that's what motivates you?  Yeah.  These two white guys who did it,  one who honestly did it in humor 
[01:34:00]  and one who just wasn't funny enough  to get out of a heckling situation  without doing it?  Yeah.  That brings it to the forefront.  Oh, God.  Kind of takes away  from the seriousness  of a few hundred years  of oppression and slavery.  Yeah.  When it's just some dope  losing his mind  at a comedy club.  and Don Imus,  you know,  slipping with a line  that he thought was funny.  And why are they bringing him  into the freaking burial  of the N-word?  It's silly  because he said  a racially insensitive thing.  Black people say 
[01:34:30]  racially insensitive crap  all the time.  It's a double plot  they bought.  I'm right next to it.  How embarrassing.  That's the Barry Imus  right next to it.  Let's say hi to Brian  in Detroit.  Look at that.  Imus and...  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hey, how are you?  All right, Brian.  How's Detroit this morning?  Well, Detroit is fine.  I'd like to give you  a little update  on the hip-hop mayor  as he titles himself.  He can...  Go Patrick, you know?  Yeah.  The only black Irishman 
[01:35:00]  I know.  Anyways,  he rolls...  He tries to rule  this city with an iron fist.  He's got more scandal  than you can imagine.  Really?  Yeah, he had a party  at the Manoogian Mansion,  which is his little home.  His palace is paid for  by the city of Detroit,  which is, you know,  losing people every day.  And the Census Bureau.  But anyways,  he had a hooker shot,  supposedly,  allegedly,  and all kinds of problems.  Let's do a little  Google search on Wyoming.  Yeah, we're going to do  that right now.  Thanks, Brian.  Phil in Detroit. 
[01:35:30]  If he had a hooker shot  and that was known,  I mean,  that's probably  a big campaign problem.  Right.  Phil would come out  in the campaign.  Yeah.  Yeah, Google  the mayor of Detroit.  Let's get some background  on him.  Phil, what's up?  Hey, guys,  what's up?  Faithful listeners  from Detroit, man.  Your best thing  on the radio out here, man.  Hey, we're coming to Detroit  with the comedy show.  All right.  Spread the word.  All right.  What's up, Phil?  Hey, I'm just telling you, man,  don't let Kwame reflect  what this city's about, man.  He is on the take.  He's a thug 
[01:36:00]  is what he is.  You know,  he was challenged  because he was wearing  a three-carat  zuconia earring around  and, you know,  really playing the style.  But that's not  what the people are about, man.  It's a beautiful city.  We continue to give  every year more money  than anybody  and telethons, you know.  It's just a good community  of people, man.  But he kind of reflects  kind of the bad stuff  that goes on here.  Yeah, you guys kind of  look a little...  What's a guy like that  getting elected then?  Yeah, you guys kind of  look a little silly today.  I mean, burying the N-word  in this bizarre ceremony 
[01:36:30]  in Detroit?  What the hell?  I know that.  I know that.  But you guys are like  the new downtown, man.  All the good stadiums  down there, casinos.  Things are happening  down there, man.  Yeah, we can't wait  to visit Detroit,  so hopefully we'll see you  at the show, Phil.  Looking forward to it.  Keep it up, man.  All right.  All the info on our  comedy tour is up on  Virus Tour,  one word on MySpace.  We should go by  when we're there.  We should go by  that cemetery  and pay our respects.  Yes.  Respect.  Absolutely.  Yeah, we got to get  our picture taken  next to that tombstone. 
[01:37:00]  Of course,  if somebody passes away,  you have to go and see.  Yes.  I think after the break  we're going to attempt  to bring back the N-word.  I think we should have  a seance.  Yeah?  I really think we should  have a seance  and try to contact...  That's what we should do.  Bring in the Ouija board.  Get the Ouija board.  We, when we come back...  I swore I would never...  ...will be contacting  the word...  I swore that I would never 
[01:37:30]  mess with a Ouija board  ever again,  but come on,  we have to today.  We have to.  By the way,  Mike in Cleveland  and many, many other people  completely understood  what you were getting at, Ant.  It just needs to be...  Oh.  It's very simple.  I spelt it out.  Plain and clear.  I was a bit confused  at first, but...  All right.  There you go.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  So...  Hey, where's Keith?  Keith the cop.  Trying to get one last plug-in  for the WOW motorcycle run. 
[01:38:00]  It's Opie and Anthony,  little Jimmy Norton.  And we got a very, very busy  few days ahead of us.  Keith and those guys  all meeting for the WOW motorcycle run  right down the street,  right in front of XM  on 57th between...  What is it, 7 and 6?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You'll just see all the motorcycles.  Yeah.  They line up for like  at least a block.  He's going to have at least  100 to 200 bikes this year.  And then he's riding  all the way to Philly  while we're broadcasting live  from WISP.  Then we're going to finish  our broadcast on WISP.  And then we're going to go  check out the WOW motorcycle run 
[01:38:30]  as they hang out at Lagoon.  Keep listening to WISP  for all the details,  but they got a fine  42-inch TV.  People are making fun of me  because I can't say plasma.  I say plasma,  then I say plasma.  Do you really?  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's just one of those  words I can't get right.  It's plasma.  Just think fat,  like that kind of an ad.  Like fat and plasma.  Plasma.  Oh.  Huh?  It's a word conversation.  That's all.  Well, you say it like  Mr. Howell would.  Lovey, lovey, 
[01:39:00]  we're getting some plasma TV.  Someone said that  on this and being back.  Really?  Yeah.  It's not plaza.  Plasma.  Yeah.  So, WISP is doing a great job  as far as our visit to Philly  because we'll be broadcasting  Wednesday and Thursday  hoping to see a lot of  old faces,  new faces.  We're doing the wildest thing  you own.  Yes.  Last time we did it,  some guy comes to the studio  with a freeze-dried monkey  with its mouth wide open  and then some stuff happened.  Yeah, used it.  Oh, boy,  did somebody use that. 
[01:39:30]  That's a good one.  And then you had the mom.  She had a kid  like a month earlier  and all of a sudden  she gave her little newborn  to some strange  Opie and Anthony listener  so she could do something  with another listener  right in front of everybody.  What a great mom.  It's always insane  when we go to Philly.  We've never had a bad broadcast  down in Philly  when we go there.  Not quite.  So keep listening to WISP  for all the details  but Wednesday and Thursday  a lot of excitement.  Then we go to  Jimmy's book signing  at Barnes & Noble 
[01:40:00]  Walnut Street  tomorrow night.  That's Philadelphia  tomorrow night.  Tonight we're in presentation  and then we head down to Philly  and by the way,  Keith,  it's 6 a.m.  they're lining up  for the motorcycle  wild run tomorrow morning.  By the way,  Jimmy's book is  number 84 on Amazon  currently.  Wow.  It's moving up.  It was actually  number 700 and something  two days ago  because I had been talking about it.  It's moving up.  Happy endings.  Go get it  at your local bookstore.  It's embarrassing.  Well, thank you.  I got it.  I got an itchy  you-know-what today.  Fuck. 
[01:40:30]  I don't know why.  But you were picking.  It wasn't like you were scratching.  It was like you were  trying to roll.  You got to roll it sometimes.  Roll it, roll it, roll it.  I was rolling.  Big story.  So they buried the N-word  and we brought in  the Ouija board.  We got to see  how the N-word is doing.  Let's see if we can  actually contact.  I hate this Ouija board crap.  It is scary.  Alright, dim the lights  and let's see if we  Ooh, that's a creepy, creepy mood.  See if we can actually  contact. 
[01:41:00]  Could you really dim the lights  please so we can maybe  buy into this dumb bit?  Jesus.  I know it's radio  but how about we dim the lights  a little bit?  We do have pal talk.  Right.  The lights haven't moved.  Contact the N-word.  They're like,  what are these guys doing?  The lights aren't dimmed.  Ooh, this is getting eerie now.  Look at this.  The shade's going down.  See, there you go.  We want to buy into this  a little bit.  Ooh.  Oh, I like it.  Oh, I'm scared.  What if the N-word shows up?  Oh.  My God. 
[01:41:30]  Do you want creepy,  Ouija board music?  Okay, let's all join hands.  Me and Jimmy are already  holding hands.  Jimmy?  What are you doing, Jimmy?  Do it all day.  You said it.  You said it.  You said it.  You said join hands.  A little respect.  Oh, sorry.  For the dead.  Okay.  Somebody get your hands  on the Ouija board.  Yeah.  Oh.  F***.  Erf. 
[01:42:00]  We are trying to contact you.  We hear you're dead.  How did that happen  when just the day before  you seemed so vibrant  in my car  as I was driving home?  Uh-oh.  Oh, it's moving.  What the hell?  The Ouija board's moving.  Oh.  F***.  We're gonna f***.  Erf.  Jesus.  Wait, at first. 
[01:42:30]  Is there somebody  you want to contact?  Okay.  C.  O.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Wait, I'm losing him.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Oh, but you yelling,  it scared him.  You scared him off.  Thank God I scared him off.  You scared f*** off.  I love him.  I like this job.  But he wanted to contact someone  I will never know.  I'm sure there's a cook somewhere 
[01:43:00]  that he wanted to talk to.  Jeez.  All right, try to bring him back.  Bring him back.  Oh.  Where are you?  Uh-oh.  Here it is again.  I  ain't  so  dead. 
[01:43:30]  What?  Whoa.  Whoa.  What?  What's that?  You said, you know what I'm talking about, Anthony.  Come on now.  Okay.  If you are here, give us a sign.  Oh, boy.  Oh, the inappropriate bell.  That is a sign.  Wow.  This is creepy.  This is, dare I say, it's a little spooky. 
[01:44:00]  It's very...  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  What fell?  Wow, what happened?  Oh, crap.  Something...  Who touched that?  Nobody, right?  What was it?  I don't...  My wallet.  It's gone.  Oh, my God.  What the f*** is here?  Is with us beyond the grave.  Dude, seriously.  What the f***?  Things just fell.  Wow.  And no one was there.  How creepy is this?  All right, again. 
[01:44:30]  All right.  Who do you want to speak with?  P.  P.  O.  P.  O.  R.  R.  C.  Wait a minute.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  I was wondering what porcelain doll that that...  Oh, s***. 
[01:45:00]  We summon you to return to Earth, to your earthly bounds.  Do not leave us.  Some of us need you.  Uh-oh.  It's not moving.  It's not moving.  We may have lost the s***.  Dammit.  Oh, jeez.  F. 
[01:45:30]  F.  T.  H.  E.  P.  O.  L.  I.  C.  E.  It's still here.  It's still here.  The s*** is still here.  Oh.  Wait.  That's odd.  Why?  Every sense is filling up.  I'm...  I smell barbecue sauce.  It's like it's permeating the room. 
[01:46:00]  This is amazing.  Klaatu varata f***er.  Uh-oh.  It's moving again.  What the hell is going on now?  Guys.  I'm really scared.  I don't think we should have done this.  I just want to go back home. 
[01:46:30]  What?  I'm...  in your...  house?  Jesus.  Baby, if you can hear me, get the shotgun.  There's f*** at the house.  I see dead f***er.  They're everywhere. 
[01:47:00]  Wow.  This is so scary.  Hey, can we turn the lights up just a little bit, just in case?  Uh...  Just in case he does appear.  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Oh.  I thought it was a f***er, but it was just a rock scream.  I forgot it's Rock Scream Tuesday. 
[01:47:30]  Hey, can I ask, uh...  Can I ask, uh...  I don't have a f***er.  Yeah, thank you.  Yes.  You want to ask a question?  Yeah.  Could you ask him how Tupac continues to put out CDs, even though he's been dead for  10 years?  Oh.  Maybe.  Excuse me.  Do you have contact with Tupac?  He...  ain't dead, mother f***er.  Ooh.  I guess that's why.  It's been proven now. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  A lot of people wondered that.  Yes.  Uh...  What...  did the N-word die of?  What did you die from?  Oh.  That's terrible.  Yeah.  Overwork.  It, uh...  Seems it never had a minute off.  I'm coming out of my trance. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, I see that.  Oh.  Thank you f***er for showing up today.  Some people, uh...  You know, buried you.  Others, uh...  As we know, uh...  Think you're still alive and well.  What do you say?  Oh.  Uh-oh.  I...  I'll be there for you. 
[01:49:00]  This N-word, I swear to you.  When you get cut off in traffic, I want to be there for you.  I'll be f***er for you.  It's bond f***er.  This is coming in.  N-word appears when you say its name in the mirror three times, like candy.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Let's see.  F***er.  F***er.  F***er.  Oh.  What's I'm doing here? 
[01:49:30]  Girl, what are you doing?  Teeth.  Sorry.  Oh.  Oh, wait.  Oh, no.  What, what, what, what?  F***er's gotta go.  Why?  What?  I...  must...  punch old ladies in the face  till they fall over in their walker. 
[01:50:00]  Oh.  Yes?  F***er.  The ghost?  Yes.  We're gonna hear from the, uh, N-word.  Yeah.  Oh.  F***er.  A-boo.  F***er.  A-boo.  F***er. 
[01:50:30]  A-boo.  Can the N-word leave, please?  All right, N-word, we cast you out.  Cast you out, evil N-word.  Oh, there it goes.  Oh, the lights are coming back on.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Well, the f***er's gone.  Yeah, yeah, he's, he's, he's, he's gone.  Good.  You wanna hear a joke?  No.  What you just heard was the O.P. and Anthony show making a mockery of the fact that they 
[01:51:00]  had a burial for the N-word.  What you heard was a comedic dramatization.  Of how stupid it is.  Of how silly it is to bury a mere word.  In an actual pine box with a tombstone.  And, and, and by using the context of a seance, we've shown how ridiculous it is to empower  a word to the point where you must bury it, and how silly and useless that act actually  is.  Right.  Exactly.  And, I would love to apologize to anyone that was offended. 
[01:51:30]  Any dead people.  The makers of Ouija board.  Uh, who else?  Isn't that funny?  Like, doesn't Milton Bradley make the Ouija board?  It kind of takes something away from the ooh spirit thing.  And you see the same company that makes like Monopoly.  Yes.  So you should apologize right now, speaking of Monopoly, to Baltic Avenue?  Yes.  Baltic and Mediterranean.  All right.  You know the property for ****. 
[01:52:00]  I shall live no further down the board than St. James Place.  Preferably, I'd like Atlantic Avenue.  Yes.  It's all crap after Marvin Garth.  Right.  Well, you know, if you're on boardwalk, you're safe.  Yeah.  But then you're just a mere go away from ****.  Boy, I can't even go to the phones, because we want to show some responsibility today.  We're trying to be good. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, we took that one right to the edge, but sorry.  We can't go to the phones.  I don't know what.  Look, look.  Phones are working.  Maybe we should take a break.  Hey, if they're going to make a mockery of the word and actually have a freaking funeral  for it.  Oh, no need.  You don't think the listeners are going to be responsible?  Oh, no.  No, no.  Responsible.  No.  Well, look.  The phone thing's working.  Look.  No, it really isn't, Jimmy.  Look.  Look, see.  Go over there.  Look, look.  Wait, no.  You have to lower it, though.  No, no.  See, it's not working. 
[01:53:00]  That looks good to me.  I don't know.  Wow.  We go to eight.  Fired.  Go to nine.  Fired.  Fired.  It's our fired buttons today.  Oh, boy.  That might just get us another vacation.  Yeah, six will give us 30-day suspension.  Yeah, well, jersey, thank you, but that would get us fired.  Oh, boy.  No, we can't go to one.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  And we can't name a day after it.  No, no, no, no.  No. 
[01:53:30]  All right.  We'll finish up with the Opie and Anthony show or this side of the Opie and Anthony show next.  And that's that.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show on this fine Rock Scream Tuesday.  Also, Hummer Tuesday.  Ladies, help us out today, all right?  You're forgetting a big one.  It's Far Away Phone Call Tuesday.  And Far Away Phone Call Tuesday.  It doesn't make any sense.  And it's not like it's a miracle these days. 
[01:54:00]  Far Away Phone Call.  And we didn't even get a Far Away Phone Call yet.  Well, we talked to Detroit.  That's Far Away for us.  Far Away Phone Call with a Tuesday.  I'm not fantastic at that point.  Let's go to Tony in Maine.  Tony, what's up?  Yeah.  Tony, this is Far Away Phone Call Tuesday, and we have decided that Maine is far enough away.  Terrible.  Tony.  Yes.  Hi, sweetie.  What's up, Tony?  Not much, man.  How are you guys doing?  Good.  All right.  So, I want to call up and do a rock scream. 
[01:54:30]  All right.  Go.  All right.  Here we go.  Let me get ready here.  Meow.  I hate meows at the end.  Maybe we'll get a real Far Away Phone Call before we get out of here today.  It is actually.  The second Tuesday of the month is also Meow Tuesday.  Everybody knows.  Never.  Stop, Jimmy.  You're going to mess up the whole bit.  What?  Although, on the road, it's now going to be road rules, which is all the rules go out  the window. 
[01:55:00]  Of course they do.  Broadcasting live from YSP tomorrow and Thursday, and some feedback going, hey, you know, if  we didn't get a spot in the listening cafe, can we still come to the station?  Well, YSP would say no.  But we would say yes.  We would say no.  But we would say absolutely.  They're trying to have a little control because, I don't know, last time we showed up, it  was a pandemonium.  Well, it was fun, and, you know, they don't really like fun.  I'm not saying YSP, but, like, the corporate people. 
[01:55:30]  Corporate never likes fun.  They're attempting to take all fun out of radio.  So let's have it uber-organized and have a cafe where, like, 50 people could watch the  radio show, and everyone else has to go home.  That's why they wear ties, dude.  It's so when they start to realize how awful life is, they can just hang themselves right  there.  Portable noose.  Of course, that's what a tie is.  That they all wear.  Wow, that's good.  They stink.  But we're looking for the craziest, the wildest, the strangest thing you own. 
[01:56:00]  And E-Rock is bringing up pictures from the last time we did this in Philly.  And I'm looking at, of course, the dead monkey.  I'm going to carve your name in a beam that you were here and knock that chintzy little  table out from under you.  So-and-so was.  You spell it W-U-Z just to show that you're still young and relevant.  And then you wrap that, ow, fella, what's the matter?  Sweet potato.  Did you hurt yourself?  And then you kick that little rickety table out, and you go, eh, eh, and someone who looks 
[01:56:30]  and acts exactly like you walks in and sits down while you're still swinging and does  your job.  Doesn't matter.  Looking at the pictures, though, you got the freeze-dried dead monkey from the last time  we did this.  Knowing the lawyers, they would not allow this this time around, because, you know,  they got to keep it uber safe, which takes all the fun out of a bit like this.  Also, I'm looking at pictures of a cat skull.  I'm looking at a picture of a segmented brain with a tumor.  Not a tumor.  I guess this brain had a stroke, and you could see that in the brain that this guy brought 
[01:57:00]  in.  Huh.  Um, uh, you got, uh, pigs, dead pigs, Vietnamese ear.  Oh, yeah, someone brought an actual ear.  Oh, right, because his father was a soldier in Vietnam, and he actually brought a Vietnamese  ear.  Yeah, so.  Oh.  I can't wait to see what, uh, comes by YSP tomorrow and Thursday.  Dude, can you imagine if they screened everything, the goody two-shoe things that'd be allowed  in?  Look, I have a coin. 
[01:57:30]  Ho, ho, ho.  You do, don't you?  That's the, that's the example I used.  Yeah.  Did you really?  Dude, I was on the phone on, uh, July 5th.  Uh, you know, we're trying not to, you know, bitch as much, but, uh, you know, I got an  email.  They said, we want to pre-screen all the people and make sure, you know, they're not bringing  anything too crazy down to YSP, this whole thing.  So I called up corporate.  I'm like, look, if you're going to pre-screen this bit, then we're canceling our trip to Philly.  And they're like, you sure you really want to do this?  You sure you really want to do that? 
[01:58:00]  That's a bit extreme, isn't it?  I'm like, yeah, I'm willing to take the chance.  A bit.  If that means you're going to take us out of the Philly market, then so be it.  Well, we're not playing by those dumb rules.  When you, when you have a bit like, uh, what's the strangest thing you own?  You want to be a bit surprised.  Yes.  You don't want to be handed a list like, well, guys, this is what's, uh, waiting for you  outside the studio.  This is my exact conversation.  And then all of a sudden we go, Ooh, a civil, a civil war coin.  Oh boy.  Oh, you're crazy.  Edible panties.  Save that one for last. 
[01:58:30]  That'll be the closer.  That'll be the showstopper.  Oh dude, I was yelling and screaming and you want to talk about CC, blind CC, blind CC,  blind CC.  Copy, paste, copy, paste, copy, paste, copy, paste.  Can't forget copy, paste.  Oh, I was copy, pasting, uh, potential new bosses.  See, this is what they won't allow us to do here.  Can you help us please?  Get us out of here.  Oh, copy, paste, copy, paste, copy, paste.  Blind CC, blind CC.  Wow.  Oh yeah.  You're a madman. 
[01:59:00]  But in all fairness, in all fairness, corporates are in our way.  Cool.  For now.  Yeah, it has to be.  For now.  Because now we're going to fight like, like, like just animals now.  Could you imagine that the, the, it would just be awful done that way.  And this is the point I made.  And that's their idea of a fun, like contest.  Well, this is the point I made.  No spontaneity.  This is the point I did make with corporate.  We get, we got lawyers that are like, uh, trying to control everything we do on the radio  these days.  Right.  Uh, but they don't, they don't have anything vested in this. 
[01:59:30]  They don't lose their jobs.  If the ratings are bad, guess who loses their jobs.  If the ratings are bad.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Can I guess?  Uh, Jimmy go, you go first.  Um, the advertising people.  I said, E rock.  I said, this would be a great way to, to, to do a interesting radio in this day and age.  I have lawyers lose their jobs.  If the ratings are bad, when you know, you have a really good show, but the ratings aren't  coming in like you, like you were hoping they would, then guess what? 
[02:00:00]  The lawyer should also lose their jobs because they're not working with the talent to try  to figure out how some of these things can be done in this day and age.  We're not talking about like just, uh, you know, uh, uh, doing bits where obviously we're  going to get fired or, or get the, you know, get in trouble with the FCC, but it's all this  like gray area stuff that they just say, no, no, no, no, it's not our job on the line.  We don't care.  We don't care.  We don't care.  Yeah.  And the next thing you know, guess what?  We're fired.  They bring in the next, uh, dopey radio show and they continue to get, to get paid, uh, 
[02:00:30]  you know, fine salaries to, to, to say no.  Yeah.  They have their jobs.  Oh dude.  It was an all day thing.  It wrecked my, uh, we were supposed to have a nice little break, you know, four or five days  away from this thing.  And, and half the time was, what was, uh, blind CC, blind CC, blind CC, copy,  pay sync, phone calls.  It was a nightmare, but we sort of, uh, won the battle with this one.  So we'll see what happens when we're down there in Philly, uh, tomorrow and Thursday.  Keep listening to YSP for all the details.  Keep the calm, make it fast. 
[02:01:00]  The wow motorcycle run.  What do you got?  Oh, just putting in all the finishing touches on it.  I want to thank Roland for our celebrity that will be riding with us.  Who?  Who?  You got a celebrity?  Uh, yeah, but Roland didn't get him.  We have, uh, brother Joe is going to ride with us.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Roland doesn't have access to him.  You guys really pulled out a good one.  Brother Joe from 2U, the U2 tribute band.  Oh, wow.  Yes, yes.  Very close to U2 riding with us.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's, uh, they're going to have to shut down the highway and everything when it comes 
[02:01:30]  by.  All right.  So, 6 a.m.  Tomorrow, meaning in front of the XM Studios at, uh, 111 West 57th Street, right off 6th  Avenue.  We plan on shoving off about 630.  Uh, I have confirmed who will be leading the wow run this year with me.  Oh.  Oh.  We figured we're going to go big because we're going to Philadelphia.  We're going with H.  H.Cup Jane is going to lead the run.  Wow.  H.Cup Jane.  How is she going to sit behind you?  Your face is going to be pushed into the handlebars. 
[02:02:00]  Imagine if she was riding the motorcycle.  Just alone?  How nice to be.  That'd be to watch.  Well, and you're the, you're the person holding on to her.  You're blinded for the whole trip.  Can't see.  Right.  Oh, that's cool.  Yes.  Boy, pulling out all the stops this year, huh, Keith?  Wow.  Brother Joe at H.Cup Jane.  Star-studded.  Top notch.  Only the bets for WISP.  Well, Keith will do anything, man.  He sacrifices for this radio show.  And the fact that you're willing to ride for an hour and a half with H.Cup breasts deliciously 
[02:02:30]  mushed into your back, you're a guy who gives, so that's what we appreciate.  Yeah.  I love the conversation he has with his wife.  No, really.  I got to do this for this show.  Yeah, I know she has massively huge boobs, and she's not shy as far as showing them to  everybody on the highway, but really, it's for the radio show, hon.  You know, if the brakes fail, she's there, I could just put the tire between them.  He probably overacts when he wakes up.  He probably overacts, goes, oh, damn it, it's that silly wow run today. 
[02:03:00]  And I got a broad on the back of the bike with me, but don't worry, honey, she's also  married, so don't worry.  Oh, yeah, she might be a swinger, but, you know.  I say we get a tranny for Keith, because that would be a sacrifice, and I think Keith  would do it.  Right.  Look at Steve saying, yes, yes.  Well, the best part, one year, his wife was on to him, and next thing you know, Keith  had to, like, substitute who he wanted on his bike with Stalker Patty. 
[02:03:30]  Stalker Patty.  I think his wife actually felt bad for him and said, all right, I get it, forget it, just  play whoever you want.  Patty.  Did she talk a lot, Keith?  We'll be attending as well.  Huh?  Patty will be attending as well this year.  And where does the WOW Motorcycle Run end?  It ends at the Lagoon.  Yeah, we're going to be at the Lagoon after our XM show, so around 11, 11, 20, we'll be  there, but you guys will be there way before that.  Yeah, I think about 10, 30.  We're making a couple stops along the way, including Trenton, world-class Harley-Davidson.  Oh, boy. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, boy.  Tom's going to call you up for about $5,000.  I think they did already.  No, no, no, no.  This is WYSP official sponsor of the WOW Motorcycle Run.  Nice.  Oh, nice.  Very good.  So, we will be stopping there for breakfast, and we'll meet you guys, like you said, around  11, 20.  We'll see you guys at the Lagoon.  We'll be there a little before.  All right.  Thank you, Keith, for all you do.  See you, buddy.  Okay.  If anyone needs last-minute stuff, Keith, at FoundryMusic.com for your paperwork, and  I'll see everyone in the morning.  Okay.  Very exciting.  By the way, I just caught myself being the radio hole. 
[02:04:30]  I went, oh, really?  Like, that's the sponsor.  I'm like, oh, good.  Oh.  Why don't I just shut up?  Oh, good.  Oh, fun.  Oh.  Awful.  You're the hole.  Valueless.  Just keep valueless.  For everybody in the Philly area, just keep listening to YSP.  They got all the details, because it's a whirlwind tour for our show.  It's amazing.  Now they're trying to make a dinner reservation with the GM.  Yeah, they want to shove in.  They want us on Kid Chris. 
[02:05:00]  Every minute.  It's unbelievable.  They want to have us doing something.  So we'll try to do as much as humanly possible.  Yeah.  Yeah, Kid Chris is doing very well down there.  So, you know, I would like us to do each other's shows.  Yeah.  We'll definitely try to get on there.  Hell yeah.  All right.  My brother Elmo's in studio today.  It's his birthday.  Oh, happy birthday, man.  Happy birthday.  Thank you very much, Jay.  Thank you, sweetie.  If I say that, then it's going to give away.  All right.  That's a good point.  No, he's what?  Ooh.  You're 34?  Yeah, 33, actually.  Would you like some blueberries?  I would not like some blueberries. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, he's two years older than me.  He's 33 today.  And it's Shoot Up Tuesday, so why don't you...  Shoot Up Tuesday?  Yeah.  Is that on the list now officially?  Well...  How many people are going to do this?  And also, your car's ajar Tuesday.  No, I won't even accept that.  Why?  What does that even mean?  Tim's already working on the sweeper.  Your car?  Your car door is ajar Tuesday, yes. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, because one guy called up and it went ding, ding, ding.  Yeah, that's how we come up with these things.  All of a sudden, it's just very organic, very natural.  It just happens.  Well, one thing this is doing, it's making it almost impossible for me to say which one  of these are the dumbest things ever.  Well, you're starting to feel far away phone call Tuesday now that you heard the sweeper.  I'm feeling the sweeper.  I'm not feeling the far away phone calls.  All right, we got to get off the air in two minutes because they got some rock and roll  to get to here. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, about a little rock and roll there, Robbie Wood.  Rock and roll.  So, it's shoot up Tuesday.  So, where do you want me to do this?  Go in front of the pal talk or...  Yeah, give a little pal talk right there.  What are you doing, dude?  Don't even explain.  I'm going to stick this syringe in my body.  Yeah.  And then, you know, when I'm done, I'll put it into my head.  I'll do whatever you want.  Really?  All right.  Yeah, I'll do some really screwed up things if you want.  You can't get it any closer than that, E-Rock?  He's been messing with needles all his life. 
[02:07:00]  It's cool.  Not with a stupid zoom lens either.  I got another brother that does surgery on himself, so...  He just fills up with air.  Yeah.  And pumps it in.  Yeah.  It gives him a buzz.  Why are you taking your pants off?  I got to stick it in...  What's wrong with your family?  What are you doing?  I'm just sticking it in my ass.  What do you want me to do?  Is that what you do?  Oh.  You mean the butt cheek.  Yeah.  Not literally.  But it's not butt rub Wednesday.  Butt rub.  Oh, high up?  All right.  There you go.  On the top of the cheek.  What do you think of his cheek there?  Oh, there's a little...  It's very spankable.  Alcohol prep. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, he's prepping for...  There you go.  A little prep.  Ooh.  A little hairier than I prefer.  Yeah.  There it is.  And, uh...  Wow, that is a syringe.  It's...  What is it?  Shoot up Tuesday?  Uh, yeah.  Don't try this at home, kids.  Shoot up Tuesday.  He's a professional.  Oh, God.  Your underwear, dude.  There he goes.  Oh, God.  Ow.  Jimmy, check this out.  I don't want to.  And...  Go.  Ah!  Oh!  Pump it in.  He's injecting himself. 
[02:08:00]  All right.  There you go.  Here it comes.  There you go.  Why do we have to see your butt crack?  Why don't we?  It's mad when you see my...  And a little more alcohol.  Do if you want.  What'd you do, dude?  No, don't.  Don't.  What are you...  What are you going to do now?  Why would you poke your head with it?  I have, like, this bump in my head that bothers me, so what I do is, like, stick this thing in.  You poke a needle into your...  The bump on your head?  Ow!  Oh, Jesus.  Holy mother of pearl.  He just stuck a needle in his head.  My brother has a needle in his head. 
[02:08:30]  Well, honestly, you gotta do some strange things to be on the air, right?  Oh, God.  How come...  He just put a needle in his head.  Why do the Hughes turn all their anger inward?  I'm not...  Psychotic.  I'm not angry at all, man.  What are you doing?  I lance this thing in my head, and I squished the stuff out, and...  Oh, dude.  Some...  I forgot.  He does his own surgery, and my other brother does his own surgery.  Wow.  Yeah, Brett, the owner of FH Riley's, does a lot of surgery. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, Brett's a little stranger than I'll ever be.  Yeah.  Yeah.  After doing what you just did...  Did you just do anything else?  Oh, that's good.  Did you shoot yourself up with anything, or you just...  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, there's insulin in here.  Oh, diabetic.  Okay.  No.  I went to a party, and then, like, a week later, I was diabetic, so it could happen to you,  so...  Did you just go to a party?  I got a virus, man.  It was viral.  Damn, get out of here.  Yeah?  Really?  Yep.  Wow.  That's dark.  One day in the prime of my life...  Is that cake?  Now I'm sticking needles in my head.  Ooh, cake! 
[02:09:30]  This guy just shoots insulin into him, and Travis, this selfish bastard, comes in with cake.  Yeah, it's great.  You are wonderful, Travis.  Why don't you just bring him functional genitals?  The funny thing is, it's his birthday, and I brought in a birthday cake from a housewarming  party we had in Philly, and I go, hey, Brother Elmo, we brought a birthday cake for you.  Just ignore the good luck in Iraq message on the top of the cake. 
[02:10:00]  And I'm such a whore, I was going to give him a copy of my book for his birthday.  There you go.  Actually, it would make a great gift.  It certainly would.  Yes.  All right, we'll see you guys tonight.  Yep.  Hopefully.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  It's on 33rd and 7th, Borders at Penn Station.  We're going to be there signing books at 6 o'clock and having a ball.  Whose book?  Little Jimmy Norton's.  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, no, if you're not there, the bodies are going  to pile up, Sam.  Yeah, if you're not joining us over at XM, we'll see you tomorrow live from WYSP in Philadelphia. 
[02:10:30]  Philadelphia.  Also known as Philly, of course.  Thanks, guys.  We'll see you.  Bye.  Bye.  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show, exclusively on XM Satellite Radio.  Why is she here?  If we walk to another studio, she works at the other joint. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, you know that old gag, we're still at the same studio.  Know what I was thinking today?  What?  This morning.  Just staying in one studio is messing up the whole flow of our morning.  How's that?  Because, like, you know, getting out on the street and saying hi to the fans and walking  and then we really need that studio built ASAP.  Well, from what I heard yesterday on the Ron and Fez show, it seems to be someone in  this room's fault.  Me? 
[02:11:30]  That's what I hear from Ron and Fez.  Well, you know those guys don't really like me, so of course they're going to say that.  What happened?  The reason they're going to be broadcasting from that little closet over there, which  they've been in, which is just hysterical to have them in that little room, is because  Opie has demanded a lap pull.  That's what they're saying.  Ron and Fez are like, well, Opie wants a lap pull.  He's getting a lap pull put in, so we're going to be here for months, Fez. 
[02:12:00]  It's hysterical.  Jimmy talks about my body all the time.  I feel the pressure to keep it up, so I figured swimming in between shows would be very helpful  for me.  That's what they were saying.  And then it's like, a lap pull?  Ron and Fez are like, Ronnie.  Ronnie.  They can't put a lap pull in here.  I hear it's good for the cardio there, Fez.  It's not really a lap pull.  It's one of those new inventions where it's...  Oh, you just swim in one spot?  You swim in one spot like you're on a treadmill, but you're in water.  It's a water treadmill.  Because I don't want to take up all the space, because you need your foosball table. 
[02:12:30]  Of course.  And your bar set up.  You're going to have a full-size bar, foosball table, and a poker table.  Yeah.  Actually, tournament-sized poker tables, about eight of them with cameras, to hold tournaments  in there.  Honestly, if XM's listening, I don't even know if they listen anymore.  Who the fuck knows?  Have you heard one word from anyone from there?  You know what?  It's got to happen.  This merger...  What was that guy's name?  E something?  No.  Because I remember...  No.  It was like E-Rock.  No, E-Rock's here. 
[02:13:00]  No clue.  E...  E-Harmony?  E-Harmony.  E-E...  E-E...  E ain't going to be working here anymore.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Honestly, no one has to have a space joke.  Can I be serious for a second?  Yeah.  They gotta, like...  Are you being Opie, the actor?  Yes.  Wait, or are you being Greg Hughes?  Greg Hughes, the actor that plays...  I get so confused sometimes.  It's like Jerry on Seinfeld, and just Jerry Seinfeld on the street.  Can I talk...  Same name, same guy, two different people.  Can I talk to the inside traders for a minute, please? 
[02:13:30]  Oh, real here?  You're going to be...  All right, you're going to be spreading some news.  That'll get you in trouble with the S-E-C.  E-C, yes.  No, but honestly, and this is Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on the Opie and Anthony  show.  Privilege.  The merger, they either gotta say it's going through or it's not.  This whole business is at a standstill.  Anyone else feeling it?  Yes, well...  I did talk to Elo recently.  In between him golfing and setting up his trip to go to the All-Star game in San Francisco,  I don't know the last day he worked. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, he's having a pisser.  But it's not by his choice.  No.  He's pretty much sitting there at this point waiting for whatever's going to happen to  happen.  I mean, it's really not helping the satellite radio business.  They gotta either say, okay, it's full speed ahead or this isn't happening so they could  go back to actually working again.  We were featured pretty prominently in a CNN, in the money section on their website yesterday.  What do they say about us?  The story about the merger.  What do they say about us? 
[02:14:30]  They just brought up, you know, that we're shock jocks and stuff.  Oh, great, yeah.  And mentioned a few things that we did.  Yeah.  And then they're mentioning how the merger talks kind of have hit a standstill.  Okay.  And now yesterday, the NAB, which is the National Association of Broadcasters, those are people  that do over-the-air type radio.  They don't want this merger to go through.  They've officially come out against the merger and now are pushing with all their power and  might against it.  But, I mean, this thing is dragging on. 
[02:15:00]  And I think it's affecting business.  It's not good for business.  No, we don't hear from anyone down there anymore.  They're taking advantage of it like anybody would.  It's cutting into earnings.  They're playing golf.  I hear, like, Elo's handicap's down to, like, a two.  Yeah.  A year ago, it was, like, a 20.  But, you know, he's got time to work on his game.  Handicap is his haircut.  Yeah.  And his liver.  Yes, the club's over to Kenny, who's raising his hand, which is not too creepy.  I heard from Don Wicklin.  He wants us to do a show down there when we go down to D.C. for the virus show. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  Well, tell Don how much is he going to pay us.  Ooh, attaboy-o.  Extra pay for everybody.  That's what I say.  You tell Wickie he said that.  If they want the privilege of us walking through those studios, it's going to cost them big.  Wickie seems to be more involved with the Ron and Fez show these days anyway.  Yeah.  See, Ronnie's just slacking.  Yeah.  Allowing someone like that to have a little power.  I know.  Give him a little power, and it's over, Johnny. 
[02:16:00]  We slapped Donnie down freaking two years ago.  Who's Wiccan today?  Is anyone Wiccan?  Are you Wiccan?  No.  What's that mean?  We have an Uber Ron and Fez fan among us.  No, no, no.  That has to do with the staff.  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah, I am an Uber Ron and Fez fan, but it's when you unbutton your shirt down to your belly  button and just expose your hair.  It's like, hey, you're antiperspirant sticking? 
[02:16:30]  Not while I'm Wiccan.  Wiccan, and then you just kind of pull your shirt open.  Yuck.  Be like, you know, like Wickey, Wickland.  Well, he does have a, I mean, look, Wickland does have that type of body that should be  showed off.  I mean, if you're going to-  To gay men.  I'm not saying anybody should.  I'm just saying if I was going to dance in 1978, I would want to wear the same type  of open shirt that Don does.  No effing kidding. 
[02:17:00]  Anyway, moving on.  I think he's a psychopath, by the way.  He's very nice to me, and he's very like, shwe Jimmy, and I just know if I said the wrong  thing, he would bite my face.  He's got voodoo dolls.  Behind closed doors, he's poking like my brother-in-law.  Oh, I would not want to tangle with him.  An evil mean streak.  Yeah.  Like, you know how shit flows down?  Yeah.  So that if you get shit on, you got to shit on somebody underneath you.  Or just pay the lady who did it.  Right. 
[02:17:30]  He will, like, if he gets a little log shit on him, he will fucking salad-shooted diarrhea  the next guy down on the ladder.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Like, if he gets some shit from upstairs, these guys are fucking dead.  Like, E-Rock, how much Wickland shit have you digested over your career?  I kind of laugh.  A lot of Wickland shit.  I kind of laugh because it gets back to me.  I'm like, oh my god, these guys actually have to take Don seriously. 
[02:18:00]  Imagine having to take shit from Don Wickland.  Holy Christ.  I'd sooner fucking shoot myself.  And I have a feeling Ronnie's giving him a little too much power.  Ronnie's slacking.  You think so?  He's slacking on me.  Yeah, Ronnie, you don't have to do that.  No.  You just treat him like Earl.  Yeah.  Just treat him like a glorified intern.  He likes that.  Yeah.  I won't be a party to this Don Wickland bashing.  I'm not bashing him.  I'm just covering my bases.  You never know.  Elo could die. 
[02:18:30]  I'm not bashing him.  How could I just say I'm not bashing him?  Oh, sure.  And everyone accepted him.  No one even said a word.  I'm not bashing him.  Oh, no, you're not.  If Elo moved on, do you realize how many more people would have to move on before it's Donnie's job?  I don't know.  I mean, oh, come on.  Is there a chimp working there?  Well.  All right.  Anyway, Club Soda Kenny wants to go home.  Switching gears here.  Kenny gave me some info on the way to work today. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, it's kind of sad.  Of course it is.  You're saying it.  Anything you say is sad.  Well, can I?  Yeah, go ahead.  I'm sorry.  Big A is dead.  Don't say that.  That's an awful thing to say.  Yeah, I thought you said it was sad.  Because.  Big A is going in for an operation?  Yeah, yeah.  I was getting in bed.  Nine o'clock is my bedtime.  I was getting in bed.  My cell phone ring. 
[02:19:30]  Is this true?  Yeah.  This is absolutely true.  That's why we.  Kenny wanted to go home 15 minutes ago.  Yeah.  All right.  What's happening to him?  He has a cyst on his neck that he has to get operated on Thursday.  And he wanted to call me personally and let me be the first one to know before they posted  it on the message boards.  Because, you know, like I treat him so good at the virus show and the show is so good to  him.  He wanted us to know that he's got a cyst on his neck and he's getting an operation Thursday 
[02:20:00]  so he can't be in Boston for the virus show.  What the hell kind of cyst?  I don't know.  It's a B9, he's telling me.  A B9?  Yeah.  Oh, it's benign.  No, it's a B9.  Yeah.  Benign.  What's a B9 tumor?  I don't know.  Like the size of the golf ball.  I said.  No.  Wait, you had tumor talk and you didn't even ask the question how big?  I think he means benign, not B9.  That's not malignant.  You know, it's a golf ball.  He did say golf ball.  Yeah, but I told him that like a golf ball means nothing to him. 
[02:20:30]  He's a big guy.  Like if when it turns into a basketball, we should talk.  You know, he should have Elo take a sandwich to that.  Yeah.  A little sandwich to the neck.  Elo's getting pretty good.  He could probably pop that up without messing in other areas of his neck.  Well, he's all nervous because he's never had an operation before.  He's never had anesthesia before.  Yeah.  You know, and he's really worried that when he wakes up from the operation, it's going  to cure his stuttering because then he won't be on the show no more.  How funny would that be if he walked in, he was 125 and didn't stutter? 
[02:21:00]  Hi, gentlemen.  Big cock bulging in his pants, a lady on his arm, smelling like Old Spice.  But that head's still fat.  Hey, we got big A.  Yeah.  I thought he was working today.  He told me he was working.  Is he on, pal?  Big A.  No.  Big A.  Big A.  Hey, old tumor neck.  What's up?  Too much. 
[02:21:30]  What happened now?  I'm just amazed they were able to find a tumor on your body.  What the?  I told him to save it for the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, what do you got, Big A?  What do you got?  Um, it's, um, a mess.  Um, they found out it was a tumor, but probably benign.  B-9?  You got a B-9.  You sunk my battleship. 
[02:22:00]  He's got a B-9-er.  Thank you, Pelton.  Are you scared, Andrew?  Yes, I am.  Well, you probably should be.  I mean, I mean, there have been a lot of, uh, a lot of times people do die on the table  or the operations, a lot of times a neck operation will lead to some sort of paralysis  if they're not careful.  Well, let me tell you a little bit about the neck.  Wait, wait.  Where on your neck is it, sir?  Uh, it's on the left side of, next to my throat.  Left side front?  Yes.  Oh, shit. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, that's, that's, that's better.  Now, here's the deal.  Yeah.  Think about your head for a second, okay?  Think of everything that's got to go on in your head, and then think about your body  and everything that goes on there that's linked to your head.  Everything has to travel through the neck.  There's a lot of gadgetry going through there.  So they really got to, uh, watch, uh, what they're cutting away.  You might lose your cable.  Yeah, you could. 
[02:23:00]  Like, it works like that.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, you cut a wire, your cable goes out, but instead of cable, it's your eyes.  It could be your eyes.  It could be your hearing.  What kind of doctor you got?  Um, uh, uh, uh, surgeon.  Um.  We hope so.  A necologist.  A podiatrist.  He doesn't have good insurance.  A podiatrist.  Ah, Jesus.  So, you, did you get a second opinion? 
[02:23:30]  Um.  Yeah, he's ugly, too.  Oh, God, Kenny.  That old gag.  But it fit.  I, I, I thought it.  I was just too embarrassed to say it.  Of course you are.  Hey.  Yeah, he's ugly, too.  And what kind of tumor is it again?  Yeah, what is it?  A B9?  B9?  Yeah.  Bingo!  Hey, uh, Big A.  Yes, ma'am?  How did they find out it's B9? 
[02:24:00]  Did they, um, did they do a biopsy?  Did you say it right?  B9.  B9.  He is.  I got a, um, a biopsy of F, uh, F, and A.  Uh, fine needle.  A fucking A?  What?  F and A?  What?  F and A.  Fine needle aspiration.  Oh, so they stuck a needle in it.  In his ass.  In your ass?  No, they stuck a needle in it and pulled, pulled some shit out and then, uh, made sure 
[02:24:30]  it, it wasn't, uh, the big casino?  Uh, yes, yeah, pretty much, yeah.  Uh, is it wrapped around anything?  Have they told you if it's like, uh, clinging on to, uh, uh, your, uh, carotid artery or,  or, or, or something like that?  Uh, no, they haven't told me.  Uh, I'll probably find out everything, uh, sometimes there's.  What if, what if it's like, what if it's wound around your jugular vein and, and, and 
[02:25:00]  the ganglia?  Yeah, the ganglia is a problem.  Big A, how did they, how did you find out you had a cyst in your neck?  Oh, good one.  Um, um, a couple weeks ago I was a little dizzy and I went, and I went to, uh, docks.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, that's not good.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Checking me out, and, and he knows, uh, uh, Bumble, uh, on my throat, he asked me what 
[02:25:30]  it was, and I told him, uh, um, I don't know what it is, I'm not a doctor, so.  Must do it a fascinating exchange.  How?  Um, Pat from Menachia, yes, uh, Pat.  Pat writes, uh, it's not a cyst, it's a sister.  They're removing a conjoins.  Hey, hey, uh, did, did, do you know how long you've had it?  Um, I don't know exactly, if I know I had it, it's too, um, too long, um, uh, uh, I saw 
[02:26:00]  it a while ago, but I was always scared of something major.  Oh, so instead of taking care of it, yeah.  Uh, Pat from Menachia, coming back strong with a second hit here.  Uh, talking about the B9, uh, cyst, of course.  Pat writes, can they remove the B.O. while they're, while they're at it?  Oh, jeez. 
[02:26:30]  It is messed up your life, like, the B.O.  I, uh.  Oh, this guy's going into the hospital, for Christ's sake.  Poor Andrew must have been so.  And B jokes are all over the place.  Must have been so scared, laying on the table, just like a big fucking wounded leopard seal.  Oh.  Just, they probably just, like, pour water on him and just stroke his face.  Keep them moist.  Yeah.  Poor Andrew.  Oh, Andrew.  Andrew, was the doctor embarrassed when he said that they wanted to remove that, that,  that, uh, the lumpy mass on your shoulders and you talked out of it? 
[02:27:00]  There he's laughing.  There you go.  Laughter is the best medicine.  That's true.  Next to, uh, next to what you're going to do.  Yeah, which is, uh, cutting your neck open to move a big mass.  Hey, Big A, uh, when you get the cyst removed, can you bring it into the show?  We need it for what the hell is that?  Possibly, uh, for, or possibly we'll eat it.  Cannibalism.  That could be something on a Ritz cracker.  Yeah, try to get that cyst and bring it in here, okay?  Uh, Big A.  I'm going to try, but I don't think he can allow me, but I'm going to ask him. 
[02:27:30]  Hey, bring in a little biohazard bag.  Hey, Big A, let me ask you this.  Did he tell you what the dizziness was?  Uh, uh, no, no.  Uh, uh, you know, just gave me medication for the, uh, motion sickness and, uh, went away.  Uh, uh, uh, did he say that it might be that this tumor is cutting off the blood supply to your brain?  Uh, no, he did not. 
[02:28:00]  Oh.  That would be pretty scary, wouldn't it?  Did he give you a simple suggestion, like stop spinning in circles and you went, oh.  Okay.  Uh, Brian from St. Louis, we can only hope Big A's surgery is less painful than this phone call.  I bet you it wasn't even Big A that went to the doctor, it was the cyst.  And the cyst said, could you help me?  There's a retard stuck to me.  Oh, shit.  I'm sorry, Andrew, I have to.  Jimmy, come on. 
[02:28:30]  You all right?  Jimmy, Jimmy?  Well, yeah, of course.  Yeah.  I like you very much.  I'm a little, I have gallows humor.  I mean, I'm a little, uh, I don't like to see my friend going into the hospital.  No, of course not.  How long is the operation?  Um, I was talking about, uh, two hours.  Two hours and then are you out the same day or what do they do?  Uh, uh, I'm going to be there about two, three, uh, two, three days.  Two, three days? 
[02:29:00]  When they knock him out, they're not going to use like, uh, they're not going to use  like what they normally do.  They're going to shoot him with like a fucking, like a tranquilizer from a helicopter as he's  walking into the hospital.  A guy with a khaki shirt on.  Hey, Andrew, make sure you get a sponge bath from a nurse.  Oh.  They do it real good, like.  Yeah, you might get a sponge bath, they feed you ice cream, and they tickle your bag. 
[02:29:30]  How great would it be if you ask for a sponge bath and they just wash the scrotum of the sea  urchin?  Hey, hey, why aren't you, uh, finding this funny like we are?  Well.  Oh, I am.  I'm trying to laugh, not be nervous and all freaked out, so.  Yeah, keep your chin up.  You have to, because they're going to cut into it.  Uh, uh, Big A, what about insurance? 
[02:30:00]  Do you have insurance?  Oh, no.  Are we paying for something else?  Oh, God.  Why do we have to, why do we have to pay for our listeners' operations all the time?  I don't know.  I know what's going to happen here.  Go ahead, Big A.  Big A?  Well, shouldn't, shouldn't they pay for it?  I mean, it's not like it's an elective surgery.  It's something you need done.  They should, but we'll find out. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, did, is it, is it a hard mass or is it soft?  Uh, it's mobile, but not as soft.  It's not that soft, but it's mobile.  It's mobile?  That's a better sign.  Yeah.  Better sign.  I know.  Better sign, yeah.  Cancer is like, doesn't move.  I got something for this phone call.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:31:00]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Waiting.  Waiting.  It takes a couple of minutes.  It's okay.  And go.  Oh, boy.  That was a perfect cue, too.  That was it.  Yeah.  Where is it?  Oh, Iraq's starting to hit his mouse.  Oh, boy.  He's getting nervous.  He's panicking.  Oh, brother.  Oh, you can tell when he's panicking.  Oh, yeah.  That's it.  And we got needles today.  We got needles today.  We can stick in here. 
[02:31:30]  All right.  Continue.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Not the cancer song.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  Oh, it's the cancer song.  Big A's actually fatter than the guy that sang this.  Sorry.  Oh, Big A.  Godspeed to you.  When do you have this done?  Sometime on Thursday.  On Thursday.  What time?  I don't know what time it is. 
[02:32:00]  How big a scar is that going to leave on your neck?  Will it interfere with the bolts?  Oh, listen to this song.  You'll be on a beach.  Cigars and scotch is suggesting that my brother, Brett, do the surgery.  Yeah.  Owner of FH Riley's.  You're a big fan of FH Riley's and my brother, right, Big A?  Of course I am, yeah.  He operates on himself.  Maybe he could, you know, help you out a little bit. 
[02:32:30]  Why not?  I will not be giving him a good luck.  Oh, come on.  Say it to him.  I will not.  That's a very, very powerful thing I will not use in this situation.  Andrew, they do stuff like this all the time, man.  It's like a cyst that moves.  It's just like a fatty buildup, which I'm sure you, there's probably like another 80 in there somewhere.  I have a couple on my back.  My lower back, I have a little, little small fatty buildup cyst.  The doctor won't touch it because it's not, you don't need it off. 
[02:33:00]  You want to feel it at?  No.  Let me see, Jimmy.  You can hardly see it until I turn around.  It's embarrassing when I'm getting a massage and I'm trying to hope her finger slips into my ass and they start rubbing it like it's a knot.  I'm like, what do you think I lived in, Staten Island, you dumb whore?  It's a fucking cyst.  She's trying to work out the tumor?  It's like, how do you, and I had one massage therapist rubbing it and she goes, oh, it's a little fatty deposit.  Right. 
[02:33:30]  Was she talking about what was laying on the table?  Enough with the cancer music.  Is it all right if I go?  I got to get ready for the Philly trip and the book signing.  Yeah, right.  Kenny's a very busy man.  So you don't care about Big A, that's fine.  No, good luck to you, Andrew.  Thanks for waking me up last night.  Yeah, no problem.  It could be his last appearance on our show, but you have better things to do, Kenny.  Yeah, 10 to you.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You better go then.  And if I can, I just saw a terrific review on Jimmy's book, Punchline Magazine.  Thank you. 
[02:34:00]  Is that online?  Yeah, yeah.  PunchlineMagazine.com.  Well, hold on.  Look, I love the book talk.  We have to get to that later.  This is more important.  Andrew's neck.  PunchlineMagazine.com.  Don't forget that.  Yeah.  I mean, after we deal with Andrew.  Borders book, 7, 33rd, you know, 6 o'clock tonight.  All right.  Andrew, you're going to be okay, man.  It's like, it's much scarier in theory than it actually is going through it.  They do this crap all the time.  For you, it's scary, but for them, it's not.  You're going to be okay. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, Big A, how are we going to get the update?  Because now we've got to make sure you're all right.  Um, um, um, I'm somehow having a message, uh, message board.  I have, I have a friend, um, posted on the message board.  All right.  Yeah.  Who's your health care proxy douche nozzle? 
[02:35:00]  All right, Big A.  Everything.  Elmo, happy birthday to the day, also.  Oh, boy.  See, always thinking of others.  That's amazing.  I hope you don't die, Andrew.  Thanks a lot.  Me either.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Let me congratulate Dr. Mengele on his bedside manner.  Uh, I just want to put this out random.  Has nothing to do with anything.  Uh, if anybody has a piano case, uh, send it here to our studios. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, boy.  That's all.  A what?  A piano case.  You know, a case that would fit a piano.  Hey, Big A, just, just asking, uh, what's your favorite song?  Yeah.  Favorite song.  What's your favorite song?  Uh, I can't, uh, I can't stick a read off here now.  Do you have a graduation photo?  Oh, stupid question.  Uh, Big A.  Big A, do you own a suit? 
[02:36:00]  Yes, I do.  You do.  Okay, that's good.  Where is it?  Yeah, where, where can we find it?  Where can we find your suit?  In my closet.  In your closet?  Okay.  And, and is there any incriminating porn?  You might want to get rid of that.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Where do you hide the stash?  Just, just in case.  Yeah, just, we're just asking.  Yeah.  Just kind of, you know, want to help, uh, help around here.  Yeah.  And that favorite song? 
[02:36:30]  Um, I have a lot of favorite songs.  I don't have that.  Well, how about you give us one favorite song?  One that you like.  One that you pretend you're singing when you're driving alone.  There you go.  That you might be singing to a girl.  Yeah.  Someone's suggesting, uh, the Bee Gees Stayin' Alive is his favorite song.  That's very good.  From Cigars and Scotch.  Of course.  Oh, wow.  Jeez.  And then, uh, Rail from Jersey, uh, Dust in the Wind. 
[02:37:00]  That's another one.  Uh, perhaps that's a good song for, for Big A.  Wanted Dead or Alive.  What are we looking at, Big A?  That isn't good.  You can't play The Lonesome Loser.  It ain't heavy, it's my tumor.  Oh, no. 
[02:37:30]  Is it true Matt Hooper is gonna remove that, uh, tumor?  And give it back to Mrs. Kittner.  Hey, uh, Big A.  Just asking, um, do you have a favorite charity?  Favorite charity?  Don't, I don't.  Ah, okay.  Do you ever think about somebody who can't see right now what a new pair of eyes could do for them?  Right.  You ever think about things like that? 
[02:38:00]  Kidneys, eyes.  No, I don't.  No?  Uh, I'll be okay.  There's a check mark on your license you might want to take a look at.  Yeah.  That's all.  Mmm.  Dog shit sniffer from Woodside and Lua Flowers and deodorant.  Don't cut you by the rest to wreck you where to go. 
[02:38:30]  Don't make the best of this dance and don't ask why.  It's not a question but a lesson.  Yeah.  Just cheering you up a little, Andrew.  Yeah, this is a good song.  Hopefully, yeah.  This is a good song?  You like this one?  Makes him think of that time he smothered a prostitute in the back of his car.  Someone is suggesting, well, it would be Bill from Waterford, a faithful listener of the show.  Big A's favorite song is S-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-sudio. 
[02:39:00]  All right, Big A, I'm sure you're going to be okay.  Yeah.  All right?  Nothing.  You get dizzy.  They find a tumor in your neck.  He said they gave a motion sickness pill.  That's the sign of a good doctor when you're having problems breathing and you're dizzy and they hand you Dramamine.  All right, take care.  Just like you might want to go out on a boat.  Hey, they buried the N-word yesterday.  Maybe, you know, the Big A could be next to the N. 
[02:39:30]  There you go.  Hey, what time is your surgery Thursday?  I don't know yet.  They'll tell me tomorrow.  Okay.  All right.  They'll tell you tomorrow?  They'll fit you in?  All right, Big A, anything else you want to say before the big surgery?  Oh, no. 
[02:40:00]  It could have been his last words.  That could have been his last words to the audience.  Oh, I didn't even see that one coming.  I did not even see that one coming.  Oh, I did.  Maybe I saw his finger over the button.  Oh.  Ooh.  All right.  I'm sure he'll be okay.  Good night, funny man.  It's scary, though, when you got to go in, especially with Andrew.  He's a, you know, he's not the fucking brightest. 
[02:40:30]  He's not the healthiest.  He doesn't know what the, yeah.  It's like a child going in there.  Yeah.  You got to talk up the ice cream and Jell-O to him because that's like the high points.  And, you know, they're going to have, like, when they bring him in, they're probably going  to have, like, all the medical interns standing, like, in a windowed room watching, you know.  And the people from SeaWorld.  Open him up, pull out a tumor, a license plate.  Hey, the reviews on your book, Jimmy, hilarious.  We got to read some of these next.  Oh, yeah.  We'll read some of these next, okay? 
[02:41:00]  Jim Norton's book, Happy Endings, is in bookstores now.  Go get one today.  Yes.  And then meet us later if you're in the New York area for the book signing.  Did James Gumm actually send in a review?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  The book review, the book signing, excuse me, is 33rd and, 33rd.  At 7th.  Yeah, 7th Avenue and 33rd Street.  Okay.  Yes.  At Borders at 6 o'clock tonight.  Oh, no.  Yo, yo. 
[02:41:30]  It's across the world.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Blah.  Blah.  Remember when we had, like, the police on our show individually?  Except for, yeah.  When they really needed us to hawk their crappy projects?  Oh, now apparently.  And now they're doing something real and they don't even return our phone calls or nothing.  They want no part of us.  Why?  Was Stuart Copeland particularly fascinating?  No.  Not at all.  Dullard. 
[02:42:00]  He didn't know who Bill Ward was.  I wanted to spit on him.  But he's one of the police, so we were nice.  Yeah.  And the other one didn't know that Puff Daddy redid his song.  He barely knew that it was a huge hit.  What's his name?  Ah, the other police guy.  Andy Summers.  Andy Summers?  He wrote that book, which really, One Train Later.  Yeah.  That must, no, I heard it was really, but no, I think it was about, like, when they first  got together, like, he was going to just, we get it. 
[02:42:30]  It's fate.  Speaking of books, Jim Norton's Happy Endings is available in bookstores as we speak.  And the reviews are coming in.  They're just unbelievable.  Someone said these might be biased fan reviews, which I don't know if I believe or not.  Yeah.  No, it can't be.  I don't think so.  Maybe one or two at most, but.  Well, what website is this on?  Huh?  Amazon.  Amazon.com?  Yeah.  It can't be biased.  I mean, the first one is by Jay Romanelli, and then he has Meow in Parenthood. 
[02:43:00]  I wonder why he would do that.  Look what he wrote.  And his review, which is two, four, five stars, says, Monster Rain couldn't keep me  away.  Jim Norton is one of the most intelligent and hilarious child rapists this country has ever  known.  Take your money and give it to him so that it will become his money.  What an ass.  That's funny.  Who wants to tackle the next one?  Better than the Bible. 
[02:43:30]  Better than the Bibles, yes.  Many look to the Bible for guidance and lessons to help them with their miserable lives.  After flipping through the literary, is that it?  Literary tour de force by Opie and Anthony's cuddly little buddy, Jim Norton.  Meep, meep, Norton.  It's quite evident that there is finally a book not only rivals the Holy Scriptures in  its wisdom and social significance, there is a book that makes them obsolete.  Wow.  Norton studied under the likes of Vonnegut, Twain, and Rich Voss. 
[02:44:00]  Vonnegut, Twain, and Rich Voss.  And the beautiful part is this dummy spelled Voss wrong.  He put two S's instead of one.  Leave off the last S for stupid.  That's how you remember Voss's name.  For the greater part of his life and this book, a massive undertaken, which reportedly  took nearly 25 years to complete, is the fruit of that labor.  If you only buy one book in your lifetime, make sure it's Happy Endings, The Tales of a  Meaty-Breasted Zilch. 
[02:44:30]  Very good.  That's a good review.  I'll say it.  How about the next one, Ant?  Something that fixed the emptiness in my heart.  Oh, that's nice.  And this is by James Gumm.  The day little Jimmy passed away, a small piece of heart died and was left empty.  Why did he have to sleep with prostitutes unprotected?  Why did we have to pick up trannies with the butterscotch buns?  And why, God, why did AIDS take him from us?  I like the fact this guy capitalized AIDS and not the G in God. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  Jimmy used to do these impressions, Jimmy used to do these impressions and you would think  it was the real person.  Yes!  Wow.  Wow.  He was so talented and loved by the Streetwalker community.  This book is inspirational and makes you understand who the true Jim Norton was.  I remember seeing Lil' Jimmy in New York one day during lunch.  He and his buddy Sam were sharing some Elio's pizza bagels and fried fish sticks. 
[02:45:30]  Sam is a special person and Jimmy took time to share lunch with him.  That is the true Jimmy.  God bless Jimmy.  God bless Jimmy, indeed.  It's so funny.  I miss him.  People will tell me things like, you know, they put that you had AIDS on it.  I'm like, at what site?  Like a hundred places on the internet.  Well, this next one is another five-star review with this under the review.  AIDS took him from us too soon.  This book will let him live on. 
[02:46:00]  In memory of the late, great James Norton, I read this book under my porch with a neighbor  boy after a game of Monster Rain.  James, you will be love and you will be missed.  Rest in peace.  Frunkus.  But he writes it Frunkus.  With an M.  No one says Frunkus.  One more for now, but the boys are coming in with the better ones that are on Amazon.com  for happy endings.  Jim Norton's latest book.  Passed Away Too Young, a legend.  There's a theme here, Jimmy. 
[02:46:30]  They don't have you dying.  I know.  No one has to be thriving and happy.  This book will serve as a fine tribute to one of the greatest comedians of our generation.  This book is bittersweet.  However, seeing how Mr. Norton lost his struggle with AIDS, it nearly brings tears to my eyes  that he withered away to nothing as he penned this swan song.  I wish nothing but the best to his partner and confidant, Eric E. Rocknagle of Breathtown,  New Jersey.  Is that a real town?  Breathtown.  Poor Eric. 
[02:47:00]  Well, the reviews are coming in, Jimmy.  Yeah, they seem like, as someone said, there might be a bias in one or two of those, but  I appreciate the people reading the book.  Oh, let's have a couple more questions about Jimmy's book.  Stumpy, the trucker.  What's up, Stumpy?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Love you.  Love the show.  What?  No, go ahead.  Go on, Stumpy.  That's our response.  I just wanted to ask Jimmy, if they were your first truck drivers, he's going to ask some  sexy lady to read me, I'll do it as a book on CD for it. 
[02:47:30]  Oh.  No, I did the reading myself for the CD.  I actually did it.  My goal, actually, I wanted to get Andrew, Big A, to do a reading at one of these things,  and maybe I'll do that at one of the signings as soon as he's better.  Yeah, but he's working on his own book, according to Dogshit Sniffer from Woodside,  Big A's autobiography, Unhappy Endings.  Oh, that'll be a great book if you get Big A to do it.  Yeah.  And then I was on it during the end of comedy. 
[02:48:00]  He'll sound awful with a cancer kazoo.  Yeah.  All right.  And one more question here from Rick in L.A.  Rick, what's up?  Hey, brother.  Love y'all.  Hey.  Yep.  Mm-hmm.  Go ahead, bro.  Yeah, I want to know if, instead of getting a signed book from Jimmy, I wonder if he could  get me a book with a dick print in it.  A dick print.  Did you ever think of maybe getting one of those ink things? 
[02:48:30]  And then you could just put your helmet in it and then just stamp the book with your helmet.  Yeah, but what I can actually do, I could do a double helmet print for you.  I'll roll ink over the top, and then I'll very gently, and none of you tricksters punch  the book while I'm closing it up.  Tricksters.  I'll very gently close the book over my mule.  That'd be great.  Yeah.  You should get one of those stamps.  That'd be hilarious.  An actual print.  Of my dick.  God, dude, do you that would fucking fantastic?  That would be hilarious.  Just Jimmy's cock print.  You've got a lot of book signings on the way.  You should do it for the next one, Jimmy. 
[02:49:00]  Absolutely.  I want to have that done maybe by DC on Friday or something.  I'll try to have a cock print of some sort.  Book signing tonight at 6 o'clock where, Jimmy?  And a stamp.  33rd and 7th.  It's the borders of Penn Station.  Very convenient.  And you will be indoors.  It's very hot outside.  So, you know, you'll be inside, and it should be fun.  We'll be down there.  Yes.  All right.  Very good.  Hey, let's not forget.  It's Rock Screen Tuesday.  Now, we've got to go through all our brand new sweepers here.  Of course, it's Rock Screen Tuesday.  You guys know this one by now.  Of course. 
[02:49:30]  Still like that one a lot, right? 
[02:50:00]  Of course.  That one gets rave reviews.  Moving on.  It's also Hummer Tuesday.  These are brand new.  Three new ones to play for you guys today.  Tim from the other joint, even though we're in the same joint.  Yeah.  He came up with a sweeper for Hummer Tuesday.  Yes.  I don't like this one very much.  It's Hummer Tuesday. 
[02:50:30]  On the Opie and Anthony show.  It's been suggested.  It sounds like Tim's thinking real hard.  I think his sexuality slipped out.  But you hear a little like in there.  Yeah.  I think it's supposed to be a sexy girl kind of voice thing.  Hummer Tuesday is one of our real ones, and it's a great one.  Are you admitting the other ones are fake?  No, no, no, no, no, no. 
[02:51:00]  What did you just mean by that?  No, no, no, no.  We just take the Hummer Tuesday a little more seriously than the other ones.  That's all.  That's all I'm trying to say.  Oh, okay.  Really?  Really.  Well, seriously, women, we want you to, like, you know, to blow us.  So, you know, sometime today.  Give the guys a little treat.  Let's cut to the chase here.  You know, we got to work around what we're talking about on the other side.  But we're looking for blowjobs.  Yeah.  On Tuesdays especially.  Give your man one, and guys reciprocate. 
[02:51:30]  That's right.  Give your friend one.  Lick that snap.  Oh, that.  So we got Hummer Tuesdays, and it's official because we got a sweeper.  And then we got Far Away Phone Call Tuesday.  So far, what's the furthest call we took today, Detroit or Maine?  Detroit.  Probably Detroit's further than Maine?  Yes.  Yeah?  Oh, absolutely, then.  You think?  Maine?  Oh, we took a phone call from Dallas.  Well, Dallas would be further than both.  Dallas would be.  Yeah.  But now we got a sweeper for that, thanks to Tim.  It's Far Away Phone Call Tuesday! 
[02:52:00]  See, he's far away.  And I don't know what kind of phone that is.  What I love about this, it just annoys Anthony.  Oh, because it doesn't make sense.  It says it all.  It says what?  Just listen to the sweeper.  You can understand that it's far away.  Phone Call Tuesday.  Why is there static like he's on a radio?  There's dot, dot, dot, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep. 
[02:52:30]  Because you've got to tune in.  Tune in?  What gear is this?  You've got to tune in.  You get those big knobs and you're tuning stuff until you get the person on the other line.  I've talked to people in England.  Yeah.  That's pretty far.  Yeah.  Never had to yell, hey!  Never the static or beep beeping like you're on a ship back in the early 1900s.  So you really hate this?  It's far away!  Phone Call Tuesday! 
[02:53:00]  Why do you shout?  Why is he yelling?  You're on a phone.  And I heard him fine.  Do you really hate that one?  I can't stand it.  Oh, you're not going to like the next one.  Oh, no.  No?  Yes.  Oh, shit.  What stupid daily thing is this for?  Oh, boy.  It's Tuesday filling up.  We suggested it a little earlier.  And he already made the sweeper.  So now it's official. 
[02:53:30]  It's now official.  We want these to happen organically.  And this one happened organically earlier this morning.  And now there's a sweeper.  So it's official.  Here's the official sweeper.  It's your door is a jar Tuesday on the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm out.  I might have to leave the show over these.  Your door is a jar Tuesday.  Why is he using his sexy voice for this instead of the Hummer Tuesday thing?  He used a girly voice. 
[02:54:00]  It's your door is a jar Tuesday on the Opie and Anthony show.  And it sounds like he's trying to be an announcer at an airport or something.  Where is this door a jar?  Oh, is he trying to be like your car?  Your car?  Yeah.  Like your navigation system voice or something?  Yeah.  Oh, that is so stupid.  He's trying to be the OnStar or whatever lady.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You just sound like a gay guy.  Yeah. 
[02:54:30]  A lot is coming out through these promos, don't you think?  I'd like to take him for a drive on keep your seat belt off, keep your door open.  I'm making a sharp turn Wednesday.  Dude.  Brilliant.  Let me write that down.  Oh, jeez.  No.  I can't even keep track of the days.  All right.  It's time for a far away phone call.  We got Mexico.  We got New Zealand and Arizona.  Arizona?  No.  Is New Zealand a guy or a girl? 
[02:55:00]  James.  Dammit.  You never know over there, though.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They're tribal.  James, what's up?  Hey.  How's it going, guys?  Slight delay?  This is good.  Far away phone call Tuesday.  In effect, New Zealand.  Far away phone call Tuesday.  New Zealand, huh?  New Zealand?  What time is it right now?  What time is it right now?  It's like three in the morning, four in the morning, something like that.  What?  Something like that.  You don't have a clock near you? 
[02:55:30]  No.  No.  The hotel here, you share a bathroom with everybody else, okay?  Really?  I'm on Hereford Street in Christchurch.  Yeah.  He's in New Zealand.  Yeah, I know.  I've been there.  So what are you doing in New Zealand there, James?  Well, you guys remember I called you guys.  I'm probably the furthest caller that ever called you.  I called you from the Ross Island Ice Shelf when I was down with the Arctic program.  Holy shit, I remember you.  Yes, sir.  He's the guy that called us from Antarctica. 
[02:56:00]  And now he's in New Zealand?  Why are you in New Zealand now?  Well, you've got two places that they bring you in and out of.  Yeah.  And one of them is chilly and the other one is New Zealand, okay?  And I stayed here in New Zealand for a little while.  This guy has far away phone called twice.  Yeah.  Now, what are you doing in New Zealand?  You're just hanging or?  Pretty much.  Yep.  Pretty much just hanging.  What time is it?  It's like three or four in the morning or something like that. 
[02:56:30]  I'm not sure.  How are you not sure?  Look at a clock.  Look at a clock and tell me what time it is.  I don't have a clock in the goddamn room.  How are you in a hotel room?  Are you in a hostel?  Yeah.  Huh?  You're in a hostel?  How do you not have a?  You don't have a watch?  No, I don't have one on.  Turn on the TV.  It's like three or four in the morning.  Just a second.  Let me tell you.  He's lying.  He's looking online right now to see.  Yeah.  You can't lie with a far away phone call Tuesday.  Oh, it's like four. 
[02:57:00]  It's four.  We are.  It's Wednesday morning.  Okay?  Yeah.  How come I get in Wellington?  It's 2.07 a.m.  2.07 in Wellington?  Yeah.  Yeah, stupid 2.07.  Then my fucking clock is wrong.  It's 2.07 in the morning.  Okay.  I'm disproving him with my iPhone.  It's really funny that you're listening.  How do you know that the show wanted you to call from New Zealand?  How can you hear this radio show and there's no workable clock anywhere? 
[02:57:30]  Exactly, because we haven't done Wednesday's show yet.  It's Wednesday here, dude.  And you're listening online?  Yes.  So you have a computer.  Yeah, but it's one of these ones that are down in the lobby that you got to put NZ dollars into it.  Okay?  Well, you just said you were in your room.  So now you're in the lobby on a computer, but a minute ago you just said you don't have a clock in your room.  Yeah, but this is a backpacker's hotel, okay? 
[02:58:00]  It's like, it's hard to explain, Jim.  Sorry.  But it is.  It certainly seems to be.  I'm buying into it.  He's calling from New Zealand.  Just a little lost.  Wait, sir.  How about, is there a receptionist there?  Yeah, anybody around?  No, no, not tonight.  No.  No.  And you've got to use your card to get into the door.  What are you wearing out? 
[02:58:30]  It's cold.  It's winter here.  It's our summer at home, okay?  What part of winter, though?  February?  February.  You guys are going to give me the first, second, third degree.  All right, well, anyway, I'll give you my cat noise.  All right, let's see.  Thank you, James.  Let's see if we have better luck with Xavier in Mexico.  Yes, sir.  What's up, Xavier? 
[02:59:00]  Xavier.  I say Xavier.  The door's open.  I'm sorry.  Hold on.  Goddamn door's ajar.  Jesus Christ.  That was terrible.  Oh, wow.  Oh, my God.  I hear the dinging.  Oh, jeez.  Hello close.  Hold on.  Did you say your door's ajar?  Hold on a minute.  Hold on.  Oh, no.  My whole goal is to drive Anthony insane.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute.  It's your door is ajar Tuesday on the Opie and Anthony Show.  The guy called and his door was ajar. 
[02:59:30]  Hey, it's a faraway phone call, door is ajar Tuesday.  It's getting too confusing.  Hey, Pierre.  Here comes your faraway rock scream, gentlemen.  Ready?  All right.  Yep.  Meow.  Wow.  Bring it on home with the rock scream.  He did a meow rock scream.  He took care of everything.  From far away with his door ajar. 
[03:00:00]  Holy shit.  The only thing you need to do is blow yourself and you covered everything today.  Hold on.  That sounds sexier than what Tim came up with.  Jesus damn.  All right, Mexico.  Are you really in Mexico?  Yeah, I'm driving to San Miguel de Allende right now, boys.  Where?  San Miguel de Allende, where they shot Desperado and Salma Hayek and Antonio Banderas film.  Oh, yeah?  I'm going to the Titi Twister. 
[03:00:30]  Are you in a truck?  No, I'm in Suburban.  Oh, okay.  I thought you were a trucker.  We were going to ask you what you're hauling.  No, sir.  I'm a dentist, sir.  You're a dentist?  Yeah.  Hey, did OPC say it's filling up Tuesday?  Huh?  You said it's filling up Tuesday.  I'm filling up.  No, no, no, no.  We have way too many.  Oh, are you filling up?  That's cool.  You're getting greedy.  Yeah, you really are getting greedy.  I mean, the door is a jar thing.  We're letting that slide, but we got to stop right there. 
[03:01:00]  It's filling up Tuesday.  All right.  Anything else you want to add from Mexico?  No, it's hot as shit down here.  We get an XM reception all the way down to around Guadalajara, so it's pretty cool, man.  Guadalajara.  You got any Spanish around you right now?  Any what?  Any Spanish?  Chinatumadri?  No, I mean, any Spanish signs or little phones walking around?  Yeah, hold on.  There's Salida San Paseo del Rey dos kilómetros. 
[03:01:30]  What does that say?  Just two kilometers.  A little ranch called San Paseo del Rey or something like that.  You're a dentist in Mexico?  Yes, I am, sir.  Wow.  I'm from Texas, son.  Does that entail just shoving candy corn up in the people's jaws as their teeth fall out?  They've got to pay in the tens of dollars for flossing out tequila worms that got stuck?  Yeah, but we catered aid stations, so little Norton wants to come on down. 
[03:02:00]  All right.  Well, thank you, sir.  Have a good one, boys.  All righty.  Our friend south of the border.  Yeah.  Amazing.  We're going to take a break.  When we get back, we sent Jared and Brian on the streets of New York to talk about the funeral for the N-word.  Yeah.  So we've got some people talking about that.  Oh, that's good.  Very topical.  And we'll go to break because I'm serious.  We have brought it back officially.

There he is  How are you guys doing?  Good  I wasn't the only one on this, uh, Brian came along and he helped out a lot  Yeah, but who's Brian?  You're the star  You're the star  What are you doing with that arm?  I'm resting  Like it kind of like  It almost rests on your  It's like the elephant man's arm 
[03:07:30]  Yeah  It kind of dangles stupidly  Yeah  You look like you don't know what to do with yourself  I don't know what to do with my hands  In life?  He's got that creepy stare, man  Something about his stare  Because he looks kind of down, but then his eyes look up at you  Yeah  He's crooked  He's uneven  His right side hangs down  I lean  Yeah, exactly  It's like you're always holding something  Why are you leaning?  What's wrong?  I don't know, I always like to lean  Talk to your friends  What's up?  Nothing  Stay up straight, try it  Just try it  You feel better, right?  Yeah, you look better  No, just be regular 
[03:08:00]  Alright, okay  Jared, hold on a second  What religion are you?  I'm Jewish  Well, okay  Did you have a leaning religious joke?

[03:09:30]  See, we're good  We're real good  He hung up because he was lying  Oh, Brian drank the boiled water from the boiled barbecue?  Yeah  Oh  Yeah, but he's the star of Big Boy Made of Duty  Do you honestly feel like you could stand right next to him?  No, he's not  He played second fiddle to shit  So you guys hit the streets?  Actually, it was third fiddle  Jimmy was the star  No, it was the shit  Oh, look at that  That's nice  I made a cameo  I made an uncredited cameo  It was the shit and then you  I don't know 
[03:10:00]  I think it should be up on IMDB  If someone wants to post that  Up on Internet Movie Database  Please, someone go on my resume  And put Big Boy Made of Duty  Please  Star and set designer  And it'll be Jim Norton as himself  Yes  Because you are playing yourself in that  Yes  Yeah  Big Boy Made of Duty  I think Jared should get a credit for that  So he'll get his own little page 
[03:10:30]  Sure  On Internet Movie Database  Yeah  As one of the stars  Big Boy Made of Duty  All right, you guys want to see  What they did with the N-word thing  On the streets?  Sure  Okay  How was it?  You guys had fun?  Yeah, it was a unique experience  Yeah  Yeah  A unique experience  Why was it unique?  Well, you know  We interviewed a lot of black people  And they had no idea  What we were talking about a lot  Really?  Yeah  What the hell is that about? 
[03:11:00]  I thought it was an important thing  Did you talk to nothing but black people?  No, we got a few  White people as well  Just a few  We got a guy from Sweden in there  That would be Thomas  Yeah  But Thomas is spelled all fucked up, right?  Yeah  Yeah  That's what they do  Lizzie, is she black, white?  She's white  And she's from North Carolina  And she's an actress  Oh, of course she is  Let's see what she had  Trying to make a way into your  What do you think an actress would say  About the funeral for the N-word?  That it's good  It's good for everybody 
[03:11:30]  Yeah, it's good  Blah, blah, blah  My name is Lizzie  I'm from North Carolina  Lizzie, as of recently  The NAACP had a ceremonial burial  Of the N-word  What do you think about that?  They had a burial of the N-word?  Yeah  I did not know that  But I think that's probably a good idea  I think all that word does  Is promote prejudice and hate  And it's not necessary 
[03:12:00]  Even for black people to use it  But I will say  As a white person  Maybe I don't understand that  Oh, God  Wow  She's oozing with guilt  I will say  I thought, alright, finally  Some balls  I will say  Yeah  No  Nothing  But as a white person  I might just not get it  She continues here  Good  Have you ever used the N-word?  No  Um  Yes  Not in a mean type way 
[03:12:30]  I'm sure it's been used in a joking type way  Wow  Could you give us an example?  Uh  Oh, God  That's the big part of the way  This is on the radio?  Um  It's satellite  Okay  Oh, so  Alright  What does that mean?  And listen how he said it  It's satellite  Don't worry  Trust me  No one's listening to this  We might as well get a bullhorn  And broadcast the rest of the block  Don't worry about it  It'll still be a secret  On the radio  Radio 
[03:13:00]  Lady  Lady  It's satellite  It's satellite  We're talking to your diaphragm  Right  As in don't you  Don't worry  It's like lady  Look at me  No one will hear this  Why do you think  I even hold  I even have a microphone  Because it's satellite  If this was real radio  I wouldn't have a job  Uh  Oh, God  Um  This is on the radio  Um  It's satellite  Okay  Oh, so  Alright  Um  An example 
[03:13:30]  That I've ever used  That word  Um  Ah  I  I'm an actress  I've been in shows  About the old south  I've used it in the show  Um  I  Have  Been around  A  Maybe like  Let's tell all the racist jokes  We can  Group of people  Um  Really  But never  I've never like  Called somebody that name  The ONA office  Is she talking about that  Wow  That's the bit though  Yep  That is the bit 
[03:14:00]  Uh  Drunk Nelson  Use it in a sentence  What was Drunk Nelson all about  Origin  Um  We met Drunk Nelson  Right outside of  Uh  What do you mean by wait  Drunk Nelson Riley  Ho ho  Brian and I  Excuse me  Who  Thank you man  I love getting  A huge laugh  By bombing  Alright  What's Drunk Nelson about  Uh  Drunk Nelson was this guy  We met out  Right outside on  Um  Sixth Avenue  And uh  He had  No idea 
[03:14:30]  What we were talking about  And he had  Two black eyes  It must have seemed like  He had gotten into a fight  Or two  And uh  He stank of booze  Alrighty  You really put two and two together  Don't you  Oh  Nothing is by this kid  He's good  He's good  Forensics  He should be involved in forensics  Yes  He had a fight  He had two black eyes  And he smelled like  Look at Sam  Oh wow  That's her brain 
[03:15:00]  I pictured you in a queue  Me too  Rubbing a big flat cardboard ass  And pinching baby fat  That's how awful Quincy's girl was  He pinched fat on her arm  But her ass was flat and long  She stunk  She was like a cardboard cutout  Of a woman  Careful  A lot of people didn't like  The Quincy talk yesterday  Oh no  They were bothered by it  Very bothered  Oh no  There'll be more of it  It's Quincy Tuesdays  Drunk Nelson  Let's see what he's about  I'm Nelson  Um 
[03:15:30]  Puerto Rico  Okay  Um  Were you aware that  The NAACP  Had a recent burial  Of the n-word  Nobody had  No  Inclination of that  No  Well uh  The NAACP  Oh he sounds like  Super  Yeah  Chase  Looker  Oh I've been  Danny  Hey brother  Hey brother  Danny  Hey brother  No one had any  Inclination of that  Really  To celebrate their  98th convention 
[03:16:00]  They had a  Ceremonial  Symbolic  Burial of the n-word  What do you think about that  I think that  They should have invited me  And that president  He ain't no fucking  Good  No  Wow  He's angry  Do you have any  Superfly  Yeah listen to this  It's the same guy  Little  Go  Yeah  Okay 
[03:16:30]  Okay  Yeah  Okay  Yeah  Your radio doll  And you're listening to  O.P. and Anthony  It's the Superfly  Jimmy Snooker  And you're listening to  O.P. and Anthony  Superfly  Jimmy Snooker  On your radio doll  I'm Superfly  Jimmy Snooker  On your radio doll  And now we go back to Drunk Nelson.  We were just wondering if you thought that the ceremony would actually help curtail the use of the N-word.  Yes, it would curtail. 
[03:17:00]  Was it the N-word?  Yes, it would curtail.  I ain't going to rob it.  I need the mic.  All right.  What was happening there?  Well, it was obvious that he was a little bit intoxicated, and he stole the mic out of my hand and started talking out of it like he was at a concert, and he was doing his own sort of show. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, okay.  Drunk Nelson show.  Drunk Nelson show.  Wow, you even named it?  Right.  Starring.  I like this jar, kid.  It's already been picked up.  I need the mic.  All right.  Okay.  If you don't have anything else to say, we can go.  All right.  That's all we want.  My opinion is we are a liberated nation.  And that's it. 
[03:18:00]  And good night.  God bless you.  Thank you.  We are a liberated nation.  If you guys had one ounce of integrity, you would have poured gas on them and set them on fire.  They're in the street.  One ounce of stick-to-itiveness and gumption.  Hey, Travis, can you play that audio for us before we move on to the last person?  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Love this audio.  Yeah, listen.  Listen to this.  We got the mic up really loud.  Listen.  Jim hasn't heard this yet.  Yeah, don't tell people what it is yet.  This is good. 
[03:18:30]  Just listen.  All right.  Just listen.  Here we go.  It's guest to sound Tuesday.  No.  Wait a minute.  Want to hear it again?  Yeah, because I think I know what that is.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  A kitten mewing. 
[03:19:00]  Not quite.  Close.  Is that a puppy rolling around?  No.  No.  It's part of our new bitch, Jimmy.  Record your dump Tuesday.  That is someone's insides falling out.  That's Derek's dump.  Jesus. 
[03:19:30]  Derek was really panicked.  Yeah.  What do you need?  Botulism?  Fucking asshole.  Isn't that great?  Oh, stupid, faggity Cuban model sandals he has.  That's what you get.  He'll be shit on his bare tootsies.  Fucking asshole.  Rotten, dirty, D.C. ass.  Fucking little Timothy Hutton-looking queer boy.  I bet you when he shits, he fucking straddles the ball the other way and rests his head  and shit on the septic tank.  Fucking douche. 
[03:20:00]  Nice shit, stupid.  All right.  Travis, how'd you record that?  Oh, he was in the stall.  Derek actually sent it to me with a thumbs-up picture.  Okay.  I thought maybe you lifted his bag and held your phone there.  That's a guy who deserves a raise.  All right.  Here's Thomas from Sweden.  What's your name and where are you from?  Hey, my name is Thomas, I'm from Sweden.  Thomas.  Were you aware as of recently that the NAACP had a symbolic burial of the N-word? 
[03:20:30]  No, I did not.  I wasn't aware of that.  Well, at their 98th convention, they had this symbolic burial of the N-word to, like,  kind of put it to death so that no one would use it anymore.  Ah, right, right.  Okay, so, uh, no, yeah, well, that sounds reasonable.  I don't think that that's...  It does.  I think that, uh, using that word is sort of showing a lot of disrespect towards a whole  generation of people that were called in a very derogative way, you know, and...  He's Swedish.  What's the N-word to him?  Neutral? 
[03:21:00]  Huh?  Somebody high-five me, quick.  Huh?  No, what'd you say?  That'd be Swiss, wouldn't it?  Switzerland.  Oh, boy.  Wait.  No.  No, but...  Swedish Hulk, too.  Oh, then the N-word should be needs a car crash.  You are never to blame.  Yes, Jimmy, you just didn't know.  Thank you.  N-word should be for nudge.  What about a new one there, right?  Fucking know-it-all.  What about the new ones?  Because I don't have any of them on this machine. 
[03:21:30]  E-Rock, you gotta update my machine with all those.  That'd be such fun.  I don't know.  You got a new one, eh?  Swiss, Swedish, they're all the same.  Exactly.  They have an S and blonde hair, and they fucking hate Jews.  Who cares?  All creeps.  Um, no.  XM should get the same type of show.  Yeah.  Yes.  No more calling it in over here.  They're finally on to us.  I think we've had very fun on these shows.  They're finally on to us, so let's update the machines and give them a show. 
[03:22:00]  Starting tomorrow.  Um, here's more Thomas.  Uh, what words do you think should be, uh, quote-unquote buried?  Well, I think, uh, I, I'm not a big, I'm not a terribly big fan of the word fuck.  But, like, I, I think it's just a little bit harsh.  But that's just me.  And I don't think that the word cunt is very nice, either.  I mean, maybe that's just me being a bit of a snob, like, but it doesn't sound very nice.  And, like, fuck. 
[03:22:30]  Wow.  Fuck it.  Can we do words together?  You got fucking nigger cunt.  Yeah.  And that is a phrase.  Can we do another on-the-street interview tomorrow and just walk up to people and go,  what do you think of the word cunt?  And just see.  That sounded so funny, saying fuck.  Yeah.  Fuck, I don't like that.  I got no problem doing that.  My love for you is like a truck, Berserker.  Would you like to make some fuck, Berserker?  That guy is great.  Let's start a rumor. 
[03:23:00]  The N-word has been buried, and they want to now bury the C-word.  And let's get their reaction about that tomorrow.  But then you got to pick a word that they'd never want to bury.  Like another word that could be mildly offensive.  We'll figure that one out.  Yeah.  All right, we're on to something.  Because cunt people would agree with it.  That's just vulgar and awful.  Jesus.  And finally, one more clip from Thomas.  Could you use the word cunt in like a sentence?  Ooh, ooh, this is, no, well, should I? 
[03:23:30]  It's for satellite radio.  It feels a bit inappropriate.  It's fine.  It's a fun word.  It's a free country.  Well, uh, ooh, look at that cunt over there.  Okay, thank you.  I think that guy made a soundtrack.  I didn't want to use it in any, well, no.  So, but that's all right, isn't it?  That's a sentence.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Could you use the word cunt in a sentence?  Use it in a sentence.  Oh, look at that cunt over there.  Was he actually pointing at somebody, or did he just say it? 
[03:24:00]  No, he was just the thing at the top of his head.  He addressed you.  Look at that cunt with the microphone.  Look at that slump-shouldered cunt.  Let's hear it for Jared.  Another good bit from Jared.  Wow, Jared, man.  Coming to the table.  And Bill helped out?  Bill helped out?  I don't even know that kid's name.  He hasn't done anything impressive yet.  Oh, Brian helped out.  Brian was there.  Well, whatever his fucking name is.  He drank a little hot water or something.  Oh, just up to the cable vision.  Oh, there you were.  High speed internet. 
[03:24:30]  It's the 1-800-OK-Cable girl with the fat knees.  Only triple play gives me that thrill.  There she goes.  Yeah.  She's so not hot.  With her bulbous nose and her fat knees.  And a skirt that's a little too long.  Just trying to be sexy.  Just because they're trying to keep it safe.  Keep it safe.  They want sexy, but keep it safe.  Keep it safe.  You see her fucking awful hairline?  Yeah, she is awful. 
[03:25:00]  I don't think it's a national ad.  You know what a hairline looks like?  Remember fucking in the line of fire when Malkovich fucking makes the phone call from the park  and he's standing there in the army jacket?  We just love that commercial.  Whenever it comes on in the office, we just stop, spin our heads around,  and have to look at her fat knees. 
[03:25:30]  Those fat knees are hers.  I want to bite them off.  It would be so much fun to just gnaw on her fatty knees.  It really is hard to be a woman.  She's giving it all she's got, and the great smile.  Bitch has fat knees.  Fat knees.  The one piece of skin she's got.  Fat knees, bitch.  You're right.  All right.  We're going to break.  Thank you, Jared and Brian, right?  Brian, very good.  We'll send you out tomorrow again.  Fucking Jared and Barry make a good team, man. 
[03:26:00]  Jared and the other guy.  Yeah, Bruce.  This just in.  Jimmy's book is now at number 71.  All right.  Went from 84 to 71 in the last hour.  Happy endings.  Jim Norton's new book, and it's out now, and we're doing a book signing tonight at 6.  Climbing up the charts, like fucking, like pre-cum leaking during a headstand.  And the signing's at 33rd and 7th Avenue.  Yes.  Now, is that number 71 overall on Amazon Books? 
[03:26:30]  Yes.  Oh, okay.  That means I'm competing with Harry Potter.  Yes.  All right.  Wow.  Number one will probably not be a shoot.  Harry, you release a book the same time Harry Potter's book is up?  Oh, God.  I'll tell you why it doesn't matter.  Oh, my God.  I'm not competing for the same audience, I mean, to have sex with, yes, but I'm not competing  with the same audience.  We want you to be number one, though, Jimmy.  None of the different categories.  Non-fiction's impossible to crack.  I would never crack.  This is listed under non-fiction.  I'm sorry.  Fiction's impossible to crack.  This is non-fiction. 
[03:27:00]  So this, I have a possibility of getting on non-fiction.  No, I wouldn't.  Wait.  Non-fiction means?  Truth.  Truth.  Fiction is malarkey.  But fiction should be true.  They should just call it a malarkey book.  Yeah.  But Harry Potter is fiction.  So that will be number one overall and on the fiction charts.  I could get to the bestseller on non-fiction.  Yes.  And I could also, if there is another section of, like, self-help, that's also a tough one  to crack because there's so many self-help books. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  But not fictiony show.  The art of the homo.  Steve from Foundry.  Also goes by the name Chess Rockwell.  Smooth Lebanese arms.  He's tantalizingly tattooed.  A big books of bear.  Scurrying at every turn.  That's terrible.  He's sorry.  He may say, no, no, no, no, no, no.  But you'll be saying, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Chess shaved as smooth as a baby's bottom. 
[03:28:00]  Tantalizing turquoise rings.  Martini Steve.  Jimmy's book is in 71st place now.  Happy Endings.  The Tales of a Meaty-Breasted Zilch.  Wow.  Beating out in 72nd place.  The Reagan Diary.  Yes. 
[03:28:30]  I should have wrote about my experiences with whores.  Nancy dumped on me once.  And then later in life when I had Alzheimer's, I returned the favor.  Yes.  Hello.  Didn't you play Big Boy Made a Duty?  Yes.  It was actually Bonzo Made a Duty.  Yeah.  They turned it into Big Boy Made a Duty.  Whip.  Do you know I have a five-star rating?  I want to thank our fantastic listeners. 
[03:29:00]  Five stars.  And that hack Reagan only has four and a half.  Someone didn't like him.  Absolutely.  His dumb diary.  His Jane gum.  Stupid.  Let him go crapping his pants.  A lot of people are wondering, what's the book right ahead of Jimmy?  That would be The Forgotten Man, A New History of the Great Depression in 70th place.  How is that?  That's exactly a bunch of fucking old people.  All right.  We got Francine in studio.  Die.  Francine?  I'm also writing a book, Opie. 
[03:29:30]  Hello.  Ooh.  Yeah.  What's the title of your book?  I forget, but it's got pizza and sex in it.  Pizza and sex?  Mm-hmm.  Is this a real book, or are you just trying to be funny?  I'm serious.  I'm writing.  I'm on my sixth chapter.  Yeah.  I don't know what to say to that.  Pizza and sex in the title?  I can bring it.  It's only six pages.  And you're-  Wait, wait, wait.  Six pages?  Six chapters?  It's one page per chapter? 
[03:30:00]  That way, it seems like a really quick read.  So how many chapters is this book going to be?  I'm thinking ten.  Which would be ten pages?  Yes.  That's a pamphlet.  Just about sex and pizza?  Well, maybe it'll be a short story book.  Hmm.  We'll look forward to that in our local-  I'll bring it for you guys.  It's really good.  Is it?  Well, I can make it longer.  You just flustered us all. 
[03:30:30]  All right, listen.  Why don't you do some news?  And then we've got to do line of the day, and then we've got a meeting, and then we have  to sleep for a little while.  And then after the sleep, we have to go to Jimmy's book signing at six o'clock at 33rd  and 7th Avenue.  And then after that, we have to get into some cars and drive down to Philly, because tomorrow  we're going to broadcast live from WISP.  Right.  For the Wild Motorcycle Run that Keith is doing, starting tomorrow morning, sometime around  6.30, up here in New York.  And then they're going to jump on their bikes and drive down to Philly. 
[03:31:00]  Wow, we're broadcasting to WISP.  To the Lagoon.  They're going to go to the Lagoon.  We're going to do our two radio shows.  Then we're going to join them at the Lagoon.  And then at that point, I think they're going to shuffle us off to Kid Chris's show on WISP.  After that, they want us to have dinner with the GM.  And then finally, we'll go back to the hotel, get some rest for Thursday's show at WISP.  What are you doing?  Well, I was fired, so I'm not doing shit.  You're unemployed. 
[03:31:30]  I'm thinking dinner.  And tomorrow, I'll probably just...  Well, my brother and sister are visiting, so unfortunately, I have to pretend like I go  to work every day.  Right.  So I have to leave the house.  You don't want them to know?  I can't.  Oh, my God.  So you're getting dressed for work, getting up early and leaving the house.  Where do you go?  Feed the pigeons like the old-timey when you get fired?  What do you do?  Yeah, where do you go?  All dressed up for work with no job. 
[03:32:00]  Well, I take the car and I drive it around the block.  Because if they come out and see the car, then I'll go to work.  Oh, boy, yeah.  Nothing gets past you.  That's smart.  Then I go to the computer lab.  I surf the net.  And I send out resumes where I see that I'm kind of sort of qualified.  And then I eat.  In 69th place, the Live Earth Global Warming Survival Handbook, 77 Essential Skills to Stop Climate Change, Jimmy. 
[03:32:30]  Harry Potter is in 66th place right now.  Well, no, no, not the new one.  That's an old one.  Are you?  Book number one is still selling that much?  Holy shit.  Wow, wee.  The new one is in first place and will be unbeatable.  Jesus.  That's the first one?  Yeah.  In 64th place, you on a diet.  The Owner's Manual for Waste Management.  Ew. 
[03:33:00]  What?  I heard him.  Huh?  You know what, Opie?  Whoa.  I'm just looking over there.  What?  The Rock got all defensive.  It's weird when he gets like that.  The official SAT study guide.  No one's in school.  Why are people buying this one?  That's how bad I'm doing?  That's a great read.  I'm losing to the SAT study guide in July.  What a fucking asshole.  What's after that?  The Christmas story?  Well, you also got to beat out the 1,000 places to see before you die a traveler's life list.  That's going to be a tough one to beat, Jimmy.  Well, don't forget, these are planning out for a while. 
[03:33:30]  Mine's only been available for a few hours.  Hopefully.  Outrage.  How illegal immigration, the United Nations, congressional rip-off, student loan, overcharges, tobacco companies, trade protection, and drug companies are ripping us off.  Ooh, I want to read that one.  You don't want to read Jimmy's?  I'm going to read Jimmy's, too, but I like educational books as well.  And a book on digital photography is beating you out, Jimmy.  How about a book on digital manipulation?  I wouldn't mind that.  Digital penetration written by the substitute. 
[03:34:00]  Oh, boy.  The official guide for the GMAT review is the 11th edition, as we know.  Well, the 11th edition.  We've got some work to do still.  The 11th edition is notoriously good.  That was the good one.  Edition 10, they said, was for faggots.  Yeah.  Edition 12 was just a pile of shit with words on it.  But they said 11 broke the mold.  11 was really good.  Good luck beating this book.  New England, white.  What the hell is that?  Every Paustonian's dream.  Why isn't that a dream? 
[03:34:30]  All right, friends.  The library.  Francine, what were you talking about?  Eh, it didn't matter.  What do you got?  News?  Yes, I do.  All right.  Let's go.  Go, baby.  Do I get the tikka-tikka sign in the back?  Yes.  There it is.  Well, there it is.  And some good news for guys felt like Steve C., the UCLA has reported that young muscular  men are likely, more likely to have more sex partners than their less chiseled counterparts. 
[03:35:00]  Study author David Frederick states, women are predisposed to prefer masculinity in men and  are physically attracted to brawny men, especially for a fling.  Well, thank you, Captain Obvious.  What are you going to tell us next?  That the sky is blue and that Pluto is the seventh planet in our solar system?  Why don't you, Asif, and UCLA actually study shit that's less obvious?  Why did you go with Pluto there? 
[03:35:30]  Pluto?  Right.  Why seventh planet?  The seventh planet?  It used to be the ninth.  Yeah.  Now they don't even consider it a planet, but it would never come in seventh.  It's the last one.  I heard it's really cold and it's on a different rotation.  Very good.  Different orbital plane.  Very good.  Yeah.  But it's still not seventh.  If you are... 
[03:36:00]  Uranus.  That's the sixth.  I believe that's seven.  Seven.  Because, see, we were talking about the number seven, so then we gave you the answer to the  seventh planet.  Neptune or Uranus?  They vary.  Neptune.  They actually cross-rotate.  Don't even start.  All right.  Uranus is seventh.  Uranus.  Neptune is eighth, and Pluto used to be ninth, but now that's a meteorite.  Yeah.  What's a meteorite?  They're not calling it a planet anymore, huh? 
[03:36:30]  No.  Just a hunk of shit.  Yeah.  Fucking big boy made of Pluto.  I'm kidding.  I mean, happy endings in bookstores now.  Go ahead, Francine.  It'd be a meteorite.  It's a meteor.  Yeah.  Meteor.  Right.  Meteorite?  No, I just said right.  Meteorite?  No, you said meteor.  I said right.  Fucking Abbott and Costello bullshit.  The brilliance of our chemistry.  Go ahead, Francine. 
[03:37:00]  Ah.  If you're strapped for cash and need some extra dough this summer, roll your elderly relatives  out from the attics onto the back lawns because temperatures on the East Coast are going to be  hitting the hundreds.  If you're certain that your grandpa or grandmas have good life insurance policies, this is  a legal, cost-effective, and easy cash way to getting rid of them. 
[03:37:30]  Because let's face it, they're old, they're cumbersome, they're clumsy, and like E-Rock,  they bring nothing to the table.  So, better get some easy cash.  Everybody can't be rich.  But why not you?  Well, I love that story when Jimmy told it using the hurricane analogy.  Yeah.  Ooh, wow.  Just protecting Jimmy.  Thank you.  I thought it was parallel thinking.  Jimmy knows.  Jimmy has a great bit about that, but it's about hurricanes and patio furniture. 
[03:38:00]  Right.  Francine.  How dare you?  Oh, she's like a Quincy.  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  No, it's still good.  You're advocating rolling out old people into the heat to kill them.  Okay.  I just want to get that straight.  Um, yeah, I would say it's a good way to do it.  How many more of these do we have?  Uh, a couple.  Oh, boy.  Hmm.  All right.  A Halle Berry lookalike, Anna Sola, returned to Manhattan's Supreme Court yesterday where 
[03:38:30]  she's suing William Swann, a doctor she claimed groped her during a job interview.  Anna claims that the doctor prior to the groping showed her pornographic pictures and said,  have you done that?  And suggested that they leave the room for a squiggly.  I'm shocked he showed her pornographic pictures.  Pornographic.  Pornographic?  Hey there, Ralphie, these are some pornographic pictures.  I was thinking more of Bill Murray. 
[03:39:00]  Oh, pornographic.  Nude pictures.  What, guys?  I'm sorry.  Oh, nude.  I apologize.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Could you read that again?  I'm sorry.  Nude.  No, not from the beginning, though.  No, not from the beginning.  It's from pornographic.  Yeah.  Uh, pornographic pictures and said, have you done that and then suggested they leave  their rooms for a squiggly or a roll in the haystack?  Hey, Anna, you're a woman.  Anna's a woman.  Boring.  You're usually born with vaginas, and men like vaginas.  Your story sounds completely hacky, and you're probably a liar, bitch. 
[03:39:30]  Maybe you need to lower your standards when it comes to job interviews, because sometimes  you have to go the extra mile.  Well, I guess you didn't really want the job.  Well, the pornography angle.  Mm-hmm.  I hope you finish strong.  Okay.  Oh, celebrity news now.  All right.  Celebrity news is always a good way to finish, right?  Yes.  All right.  As if anybody cares, Nicole Ritchie's dad, Lionel Ritchie, found out about Nicole's pregnancy 
[03:40:00]  via tabloid magazine.  It's sex.  Lionel told Metro's Kenya Hunt, Grandpa, I don't know if I'm going to be a grandpa.  I don't know if I'm ready.  Stupid Lionel.  Stop whining.  Nicole's adopted.  So, technically, she's not your daughter.  So, logically, you're not a grandpa. 
[03:40:30]  Even though your age...  Ah, did you see that jerk?  Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ah, ha, ha, ha.  This sucks.  Dad.  Lionel.  Even though your age group calls for one.  Boring.  What are you, 250?  In my opinion, Nicole Richie should be burned at a stake for her awful attempt to become a celebrity.  She's not talented, so all she does is do coke to go to rehab, get skinny and skinnier, 
[03:41:00]  date loser DJ boyfriends, and swap boyfriends with her.  What happened to her mic?  I don't know. It must have broke.  Frenzy?  She's okay. I got her.  Logan on PalTalk is suggesting, I wish Elmo would jab a syringe into her head.  Which Logan is that?  I got one.  Yeah, you want to take a syringe to the head? 
[03:41:30]  Logan 742.  Well, you all did it.  I don't think that sounds, syringe doesn't sound like a cool...  You want my brother to do it again? Watch what he does to his head.  You want to stick it in my head again?  Yeah, you can only do it once, though, right?  I'll do it again, okay.  I can only do it once.  Was that the end of the news?  Um...  It is now.  Say yes.  Oh, yes.  It's in my fucking head.  Yeah.  Because this is more important.  Wow!  Oh, it made a crunchy sound. 
[03:42:00]  Because it's in a cyst.  Dude, what is wrong with you?  Well, this time it wasn't an assist.  It's just in my skull.  Just in my brain case.  Dude, that can hit your brain.  What's wrong with you?  Your skull is pretty thick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll think it's a skull.  Protect you.  Oh, I don't know about that.  That would hurt.  I'll think it's a skull.  Five inches?  There you go.  Yeah.  Very good.  Yours probably would be five inches thick.  Yeah.  I would think.  It's a fucking...  It's a lima bean floating around in... 
[03:42:30]  What was your last story?  Without reading it, what was it about?  Uh, there's one about Beyonce and one about, um...  Ted Knight?  Avril Lavigne.  Yeah.  All right.  Francine with the news, everybody.  Time for a line of the day.  Ooh.  We got to get out of here.  We got a busy, busy, busy day.  Yes, we're so goddamn busy.  And then we got to hit the road and go down to Philly.  We got a runner-up line of the day. 
[03:43:00]  Here it is.  Ooh.  That's it?  That is someone's insides falling out.  That's Derek's dump.  Jesus.  Derek was really panicked.  Isn't that great?  Oh, stupid, faggity Cuban model sandals he has.  That's what you get.  He'll be shit on his bare tootsies.  Fucking asshole.  Hot and dirty DC ass.  Little Timothy Hutton-looking queer boy.  I bet you when he shits, he fucking straddles the ball the other way and rests his head and 
[03:43:30]  shit on the septic pants.  Fucking douche.  Nice shit, stupid.  There's a little segment of the day there.  Ripping apart Derek.  Yeah, they're turning it into a bit of the day.  That's all right.  Francine, we cut you short because we got to get out of here.  That's all.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  Don't be so sad.  I'm not sad.  I'm very...  I'm always happy when I'm around you guys.  That's why we love Francine.  Your eyes get really big.  What?  Are you serious?  Yeah, they get like big, like the dude in the rowboat in Caddyshack. 
[03:44:00]  Caddyshack?  Oh, yeah, man.  My ass?  No, your eyes.  Like, all of a sudden, like...  Wow.  I don't know what triggers it, but all of a sudden you got those big eyes like that guy  in Caddyshack in the rowboat that's fishing.  I've been told that my eyes are very beautiful.  They are very beautiful.  Thank you.  But they just go like this sometimes. 
[03:44:30]  It's the worst horn ever.  That's fantastic.  By the way, Steve from Bayshore, he's still working hard even though we gave up on the  show 20 minutes ago.  Steve writes, she has sickle cell stupidia.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  It ain't heavy, it's my tumor.  Is it true Matt Hooper is going to remove that tumor and give it back to Mrs. Kittner? 
[03:45:00]  A little Josh Chuck for you.  Oh, we're live?  Yeah.  I thought it was still going, I swear to God.  It gets confusing sometimes.  It does.  All right.  Brother Elmo, happy birthday.  Thank you very much.  Thanks to the PalTalk people, too.  I already have an issue.  Because there was a couple lines.  One that Ant did and one that Ope did.  Oh.  One of which.  Oh, yes.  But Ope definitely had line of the day. 
[03:45:30]  What?  I think Ope had line of the day.  No.  It was too racist.  But, you know, that would be pushing it.  All right.  What was the line?  Just without.  Well, here's line of the day.  Here comes.  Here comes.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  A couple of horses pulled a pine box adorned with a bouquet of fake black roses and a black ribbon printed with the derivation of, with a derivation of the word. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  What does that mean?  Is it the actual word?  Or derivation thereof?  I don't know.  It'd be funny, though, if someone just saw that on the coffin and went, ah, the fella must have died.  He just saw it.  Oh, gee.  Wow, they must not have liked him.  Got it.  I guess he died without any ID on him. 
[03:46:30]  Wow.  Yes!  Yes!  That's great.  That one was brutal, man.  I would like to have seen, though.  What happened to Anthony's?  I thought that, as I already mentioned, that was Line of the Day, but I think Anthony should have got a mention for a, hey, tumor neck.  Oh, that made us laugh really hard.  That was a beautiful, brutal line.  Had to get his attention.  Yeah, I know what he was in for right away.  I know he's still listening, so this is Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:47:00]  Big A, I hope everything goes well with your surgery.  I really do.  Yes, of course.  We're thinking of you.  And give us an update when you can.  Yes.  Anything else you want to say?  Because, yeah, well, I'll tell you this much.  I hope it goes well, because you know Ron and Fez will do the fucking funeral.  Jesus.  They will.  They absolutely will.  And stretch it out for three fucking months.  I know.  But it will all be, like, put together well, and they'll do a good live show.  Oh, it'll be perfect.  They'll wheel the casket out, that huge casket with Big A in it.  They'll have a song and dance number. 
[03:47:30]  It'll work out fine.  Fez will do a few characters.  Ron will have some brilliant lines.  Johnny will do a porn thing.  Yeah, of course.  And we'll all go, how come we don't do that at live shows?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we're lazy.  The audience will sit there and pay attention and actually, you know, listen to what they're  saying and not just throw out racist words like animals.  Can you imagine if we...  Every one of us at our table went, these son of a bitches are making us look bad.  They know how to put on a live show and their audience knows how to behave is what it is.  However, if we did a live show and we had a wedding with a girl and her father were dancing, 
[03:48:00]  do you know how many fucker I dids would have been screamed by the girl's father?  Yeah.  I know.  A bride and her father are slow dancing and their audience was actually watching and  enjoying it.  I saw tears in Ronnie's eyes.  Whereas our audience would just be like, you know, like Jimmy said, just with the rudest  fucking comments.  Like, where's daddy going to get his pussy now? 
[03:48:30]  I bet you'll miss the whisker marks on your thighs.  We do share a certain audience with Ron and Fez, but they have their people.  Yes.  And they have their people and we have...  And we have despicable animals.  We have our...  Whatever they are.  I know one thing, though.  Our listeners can beat up their listeners.  I'd want to have that fight.  A rumble.  Let's have a rumble.  ONA listeners, Ron and Fez listeners. 
[03:49:00]  I say ONA listeners, beat the shit out of Ron and Fez listeners.  Only if there are costumes.  Like LARPing?  Yeah.  But with...  Costumes.  What kind of weapons?  Chains?  Knives?  Just costumes.  Fists?  Costumes.  And costumes.  They'll make it that much funnier when we beat them up and they're wearing silly costumes.  What about the Gladiator version?  You know, remember the last show Gladiator where people would fight but nobody would get hurt?  No, we got to have good costumes. 
[03:49:30]  How about...  I say that our listeners dress up like paparazzi and their listeners dressed up like Diana being pulled out of a car in a fucking French tunnel.  Exactly.  I don't know why I didn't think that would bomb.  Because that's what...  Speaking of car in a tunnel...  Oh, there she goes.  I knew I got greedy when I said paparazzi first.  Yeah.  Excuse me, it's autograph time. 
[03:50:00]  What?  Give the plug so we can get out of here.  Wow.  Dear Jeff, rock on.  We have a signing tonight for my book, Happy Endings.  Fucking rock on for 12 fucking years already.  What time and where?  I want to...  I want to...  I want to...  You should ask, sweetie.  It's 6 o'clock.  At Borders...  You rock.  At Borders 70...  30...  Wait.  33rd and 7th, Borders by Penn Station.  6 p.m.  Tonight, we'll all be there.  The boys will be there.  I'll be there.  Francine will be there in a pair of panties.  33rd and 7th?  Yes, the Borders at Penn Station.  Penn Station. 
[03:50:30]  Oh, okay.  And then tomorrow morning at 6 a.m.  for the WOW Motorcycle Run on 57th and 6th.  You guys just line up and keep the cop.  We'll be there and they're going to take a motorcycle ride down to Lagoon in Philly.  We're broadcasting from Philly tomorrow morning.  We got the book signing tomorrow night in Philly.  We got E-Rock doing the show. </pre>
