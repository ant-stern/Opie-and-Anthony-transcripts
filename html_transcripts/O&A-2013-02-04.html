<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering off on tangents fueled by the hosts' crude humor and offensive language.  The show began with a scathing critique of Yakov Smirnoff's "Dinner Adventure" in Branson, Missouri.  The hosts, along with callers, relentlessly mocked a promotional video showcasing the show's unappetizing food, bizarre "special effects" (flames and bubbles), and the generally underwhelming presentation. They further ridiculed Branson itself, labeling it a "low-budget Vegas" filled with aging performers,  questionable attractions like the Hollywood Wax Museum and Silver Dollar City, and an overwhelming Christian and patriotic atmosphere.  The Osmond Brothers' appearance in Smirnoff's show, particularly one brother's ill-fitting wig, was a particular target of their mockery.  The segment ended with the hosts jokingly proposing a Branson bus tour, further highlighting their disdain for the town.

The show then shifted to a humorous anecdote about a disastrous convention planning meeting in Branson, leading to a discussion on Brett Ratner's firing from the Oscars for using a homophobic slur.  The hosts debated the overreaction, arguing that context matters and that such controversies are often manufactured to maintain funding.  This segued into a nostalgic discussion of classic talk shows like Merv Griffin and Johnny Carson, contrasting their more relaxed atmosphere with the perceived political correctness of modern programming.  The hosts shared anecdotes from the late-night TV world, and this transitioned into a lengthy discussion about Bill Murray, sparked by one host's dislike of *Stripes*.  This involved a listener call offering an explanation for Murray's acting choices in *Caddyshack*, and further discussion of other actors like John Candy, Harold Ramis, and Dan Aykroyd.  Pat Oswald and Charlyne Yi appeared in studio to promote their dark comedy *Young Adult*, which the hosts described as having a shocking ending. The segment concluded with a recap of the hosts' Twitter feud regarding Bill Murray.

The next segment began with a discussion about movie poster tropes, including "sexy back" shots and oversized heads. An unidentified person was in studio for this portion.  This was followed by a call from comedian Pat Cooper, who recounted a bizarre scene from *King of Queens* where he remained motionless for an extended period.  The conversation then jumped to airline travel, sparked by Alec Baldwinâ€™s removal from a flight.  Pat Cooper joined the hosts in sharing anecdotes about unruly passengers and difficult flight attendants. The discussion expanded to customer service challenges in various professions, before moving to the Republican presidential primary debates, focusing on Donald Trump and the general political climate.  The segment ended with further jokes and anecdotes about security personnel and dealing with confrontational individuals.

A segment focused on police officers, specifically contrasting how male and female officers are perceived and treated. The discussion stemmed from a recounted incident where a female officer was severely beaten.  This led to a conversation about the physicality of officers, with personal anecdotes from the hosts and callers.  A video of teenagers bullying another teen was shown and analyzed, leading to a discussion on bullying and societal changes.  Further tangents included a bad rendition of the national anthem at a sporting event (with a lengthy discussion of R. Kelly's infamous performance), recollections of childhood prank calls, a story about digging a hole to catch fish, and experiences with the USO in Iraq. The segment closed with a discussion of "Hogan's Heroes."

The final segment discussed the desensitization of society to tragedy, using the Titanic and the potential for future attractions based on the World Trade Center or Pearl Harbor as examples.  They also discussed the comedic treatment of war, mentioning *M*A*S*H* and Chris Morris's *Four Lions* (mistakenly called *Young Lions*).  The segment referenced Chris Morris's *Brass Eye* and its controversial pedophilia segment, ending abruptly.

[00:29:00]  entertainment to distract you so while you're watching people jump like fools you can eat without  worrying to applause or laugh okay i just i just i just heard something i heard it too this could be  this could be great this could be great see i thought i i gotta give it away ahead of time  i was very extremely uncomfortable by the tray the tray because everything is squeezed onto the  tray you feel like you feel like you're in a hoarder's house there's no room for anything  now this and let her let her just say how could you eat dinner without a table listen to this listen to 
[00:29:30]  this single show some people ask how can you eat dinner in a theater since there's no table oh no  you have to put that shitty tray on your lap precariously balance that fucking thing on your lap  it's the tiniest tray ever that's what the fucking oh is you order these little fold-out things no i'm  sure you just rested on your fucking well she'll probably explain she's gonna explain but you oh my god 
[00:30:00]  people are spilling food left you know why because then they could just come in and sweep the floor  down and get another show going they don't have to clean tables they don't have to uh worry about  tables and chairs nothing worse than when you have to eat your meal on your lap well what what do they  do but what do they sit on are they just chairs we're gonna find out what do you think fists i don't  know but this sounds like so fucking bad 40 bucks no table she's gonna brag about the tiny tray i think  yeah that's definitely it all right let's hear come on i'll show you okay show us oh it's like 
[00:30:30]  actually we do have tables no you don't and they're custom built just for our oh they flip out like  we have a little secret there are four very strong magnets embedded in each table it prevents sliding  and sleeping the only way to really say pause why are they promoting the stupid  fucking tray table with the magnets so you got to sit there in a theater seat like a movie theater seat 
[00:31:00]  that has a fold-out thing like an airplane uh like in the armrest it comes out and then sit there  and eat literally two inches away from the slob next to you  do you know how many fucking people are promoting it this way yeah this is this final  selling point where you're like oh yeah four magnets we got to get tickets immediately four  magnets i didn't know i had the four i thought there were three i was expecting three magnets i'm  very impressed with yakov's theater gives you four four magnets we got to get tickets for the next 
[00:31:30]  show we've been to so many two magnet places and the tray slipped and slid all night  do you know how many old people must be cutting the meat and the tray flips on the floor  yes so they finally had to come up with the magnet system but you're just hitting elbows with some  geriatric fucking disgusting slob oh man fucking getting old's gonna suck yakov you think yakov sits  down there in those chairs and eats on his fucking four magnet tray no he's having his sinuses fixed oh 
[00:32:00]  god but the half the videos is lady fucking promoting the the magnets i'd love to see the  fucking magnets pulling old bags bridge work right out of her mouth it just fucking flies out of her  face onto the tray they're just addressing what they know the old people watching this yeah and be  asking exactly and if people come and they have too much melanin we tell them no talking during show  we got milkman another trucker check it in uh milk bag what what are you hauling today

[00:34:00]  and go into nature for a while yeah big power plant that shit always drives me nuts the sewage  fucking pipes spilling into the river as you're trying to enjoy nature sounds great what  what missouri dnr has one of the world's largest fish hatcheries down there enough about the fish  hatcheries exactly right there i don't want to see where fish are coming in each other it's just gross  all right sir do you think a shark in history a shark has ever come in the mouth of another shark 
[00:34:30]  for as long as sharks have been around do you think one shark has ever sucked the  cock of another shark i'm sure by accident yeah i'm sure by accident absolutely let's learn about  the magnets place i need to know more about the magnets for the the only way to really say it in  words is that it's an experience i don't think it's a show there's an emotional value in the show  that it's hard to put in words and i think you just have to see it to to really understand it 
[00:35:00]  yakov's dinner adventure it will blow you away  oh man that that looked like a goof that looked like some kind of a goof i don't know if he's  goofing though no i have no idea as a comic you would think you would put that in at the end to be  silly but oh i don't know oh what is this what's he saying no no no no are we gonna he wants a porno  booth what is this the video is called yakov's dinner adventure funny promo oh okay oh this is 
[00:35:30]  the this might be fun that one was the informative one this is the funny promo that was the serious  cell one and this is now what have fun with the whole thing oh they spell oh this is kind of funny  it's russian around branson ticket outlet but they spelled russian wrong at first and they put russian  around like if you're in a rush you know you're russian around branson but then he changed it to  r-u-s-s-i-a-n russian around branson ticket outlet okay that's angering well you know what i agree 
[00:36:00]  with them this is funny so that is comedy so far funny okay house next door to me  he's sitting there in this little hi how can i help you my kids i promised them that we're going  to go see a magician guy you know with the tigers and then for my wife i said we're going to go see  the 12 irish tanners because you can clearly see i'm irish 
[00:36:30]  oh the canned laughs so we were wondering if we're going to be able to squeeze them both  in today of course again here in russian around branson we aim to please we have 12 irish tanners  at 2 p.m you got kirby at 8 p.m kirby is the wannabe ziegfried and roy guy do you have plans for  dinner yakov's dinner what do you suggest pause well you have your heart set on a table because 
[00:37:00]  if you don't we have magnets for you do you fly coach because if you fly coach you're going to love  the dinner arrangements i wonder if they have to ask the old people if they have metal rods in their arms  some kind of that like gets stuck on the magnet no dinner for you if you get the metal rods  why was that canned laughter that was horrible it's got to be it's funny i don't get it he's  supposedly a comic i guess he is a comic no why would he sit there and think this is funny because 
[00:37:30]  he was never funny he he was he's been a hack forever huge yeah he was huge but he was never  funny before people would say he was funny because it was like he's a russian guy he goofed on russians  and we hated russians so anybody that looked like a dumb russian we were like that was funny to us  i think uh for the time when he first came out he was funny doing that bit i think the problem that  people have with yakov is he never fucking let it go he bashed the soviet union when we hated the 
[00:38:00]  soviet union so he was like you know it was like having a guy do a wacky japanese right thing for the  time when it was all about russia this guy comes along he's got a little set about russia i think for  the time is probably considered very funny probably was but now 40 how many years you think 30 years  later easily he will not let it fucking go he's built quite the empire well i'm irish yeah  they get it candlestar not let's uh click on that and see what what he's going to suggest for dinner  i wonder oh boy a shotgun shell you put the end in your mouth and you take your toe and you flick it 
[00:38:30]  don't mention the four magnets don't mention the four magnets don't mention the four magnets  scrumptious scrumptious strawberry shortcake what do you think he'll say delicious yeah he's  gonna say scrumptious he loves saying scrumptious i'm gonna go with scrumptious  is he gonna go with refreshing fun fun fun fun fun good magnets tray anything i don't know if he's  gonna hit up the magnets here you don't want to you don't want to bludgeon the guy with too much fun  and enjoyment if you're gonna have dinner why not have an adventure 
[00:39:00]  yakov's dinner adventure  it starts at 4 30. why is he having a fucking wink  he winked it made the it made the little bell when he winked and then he uh a canned laughter came in  even the canned laughter kind of let that one bond yeah because he's yakov they can't even get the  the right canned laughter that was canned in difference that was camden laughter 
[00:39:30]  can you rewind that a little bit yeah i gotta i definitely gotta well i like the wink with the  little sound effect you like that yeah i kind of like it it's nice it starts at 4 30 and it ends  at 6 45 what so you can easily make it hold on two hours and 15 minutes of horseshit in the  afternoon pretty much it's probably an intermission though so they can all go to the bathroom and  fucking empty their diapers oh just that horrible fucking pure aged old person shit 
[00:40:00]  how would you know that it really is like  fucking creamed corn you ring out their underwear like a fucking dishrag  fucking socks roll yellow  i do with yakov's dinner theater bathroom must smell like when you walk in there oh god smells  like disease yeah death right colostomy cleaning station yeah bird show any show at 8 p.m would be  good let's say you want to see hey goods you still go to irish tanners yakov's dinner adventure and then

[00:49:00]  they want us to do a bus tour right yes and eric came up with a pretty good idea when we're all  talking these these guys down the hall want us to do the same old same old yeah bus tour no offense  because we love these areas but we've been there a million times they want us to basically go  basically yeah boston new york all the markets philly already washington maybe squeeze up to cleveland 
[00:49:30]  love all those places and we'll be back yeah and uh eric's like why don't we go  to places we've never been and maybe we'd go just to branson oh my god i would love that can you  imagine broadcasting from branson missouri yeah i want to go to branson troy wants to go to dollywood  we go dollywood we go branson branson could could you do that in the same trip do you know you know  what branson has remember a little act in vegas called ziegfried and roy sure with the tigers and 
[00:50:00]  stuff sure they have a guy just as good named kirby and he's got a tiger and he does a  fucking tiger show kirby all right let's go see kirby and kirby and you want music yeah how about pierce  arrow  what exactly what's pierce arrow uh they're apparently a very big band down there look at kirby  kirby oh kirby jesus we were watching videos of the hotels around branson yeah and um you know what they 
[00:50:30]  were you know the highlights they were they were highlighting and putting little text on the  bottom they were like covered entrance nice and so you pull up and there's a covered entrance to the  hotel and then they'd be like the lobby nice and then they showed the rooms yeah they literally showed  the hair dryer on the wall three times during the day because it's such a a special one that's nice  though instead of getting it out of the closet oh yeah do you know there's a titanic replica really in  there where you go on to an actual replica of of the titanic all right it's half the titanic well 
[00:51:00]  why not the whole titanic i don't think they could afford it or the other half's in the water and  that's probably what they're trying to say maybe maybe uh there's a hollywood wax museum in branson  yeah we have to go wow look at his own place oh yeah they all have their own place the yakov dinner  adventure that's its own place too can we have our own place i would imagine opie and anthony go to  branson gambling there too right do they no they're they're dry town too so why don't we do dollywood 
[00:51:30]  branson and i thought they did card gambling there i don't know you got to go to the liquor store and  buy your booze or something in another town and then you could take it there and drink but all these  clubs that all these horrible places to see like kirby you can't drink in there you got to see kirby  stone fucking sober he's the prince of magic though he is the prince of magic just get all  fucked up in a bus yeah that's true get fucked up in the bus stumble into kirby get off and see kirby 
[00:52:00]  look down there for an answer how many hours from new york city to branson someone out there knows  how many hours from new york to branson missouri i will guess i'm gonna say it's pretty far it's like  in the middle of the country it is a little further east than west but yeah um it's probably pretty  fucking far is it pushing the middle of the country yeah it's pretty close to so that's a week  yeah how far how far is it what what what what 18 hours 18 hours well we could sleep right 
[00:52:30]  we don't we can fly to st louis and meet the bus whoa now you're talking wow man you fly out you  grab the bus in uh branson missouri and then we make our way home tennessee we could we could hit  up kentucky you know up to tennessee i did gotta go to west virginia i did notice on the videos there  is a brand new airport in branson too all right all right so uh i don't know what kind of planes flying 
[00:53:00]  in there maybe the one that william devane is flying in his gold commercial i'll get a i'll get a ride  from bill devane is a show-off it really is oh look i got a plane i got gold i'm by a big tree i  ride horses all right hate bill devane why don't we get a ride from uh mr lee abrams oh i'm sure he  flies out there i remember when he had something to do with this whole mess i miss lee abrams all the  all the creative people kirby were shown the door i left his place years ago years ago years years 
[00:53:30]  years ago everything that was a cliche in radio he would come over and yell at you to stop doing  yeah stop doing it it's like but wait what if i do it ironically yeah we learned a lot from a hipster  i don't know if he liked us at first though i don't think he got it he ended up liking us though yeah  a lot of people don't like us when they first meet us or after or after or during during  that's why i think i'm reaching out to jim chandler that is nice of you i think that's where i made my 
[00:54:00]  mistake yeah when i was 18 i should have played it differently hey where is he broadcast from  nashville nashville you know what well how far is nash would he welcome us into his studio to do  our radio show alongside his radio show tennessee actually shares a tiny bit of border with missouri  missour yes where's the nashville part though i don't even know xm has studios in nashville oh man  why would we go there jim chandler's there that's why where's nashville i know 
[00:54:30]  tennessee but what part i have no idea is it the middle of the state is it where i always get  confused between memphis and nashville where they are in the state yeah right in the middle it's right  in the middle nashville's in the middle memphis is way all right then we could squeeze through  kentucky i hear we have a lot of fans in kentucky we could meet up with dr steve dr steve's in kentucky  we could get our prostates checked oh i don't listen to it oh yeah flood flood 
[00:55:00]  pierce arrow oh god what the pierce arrow theater they all have their own theaters and they're all  lumps of shit can we hear theaters are all like these fucking horrible looking places can we hear  one pierce arrow song oh get some pierce arrow on there please let's hear some pierce arrow this is  what we'd hear if we went to um branson missouri i would guess there's some kind of christian rock  band i don't know what a banner of liberty they're oh here it is hold on hold on pause it for a second 
[00:55:30]  all right hold on what what happens in branson by the way stays it's very yes uh fortunately they stay  there uh because you don't want to know you don't want it anywhere else too embarrassed they um they're  very patriotic it's this over the top horrid fake patriotism a lot of flag waving a lot of uh usa  you know yakov does this whole tribute to being uh you know an immigrant and coming over here and  making good and the dream yes it is dinner theater and i guess pierce arrow performs banner of liberty 
[00:56:00]  let's hear what's a pierce arrow from branson missouri sounds like  oh my god this stinks already look at this horrible stage  you'd have to listen to this for two hours it's a two-hour show

[00:57:00]  harmony but they're they're not singing together  i pledge my allegiance to the grand old flag and they all start applauding this is like a cult  branson's a cult  but they're not insane no they really sound horrible  it's pierce arrow it doesn't matter how they sound open they got  pink lamÃ© jackets on what's even creepier someone decided they needed that  fucking tape this and put it on youtube yes 
[00:57:30]  uh well the pierce arrow fans the testimonials i've heard about branson and pierce arrow have  been uh wonderful can we find that video pierce arrow sang at a sarah palin rally  of course they did remember that makes perfect sense of course you don't victory in missouri  uh well could i i want to hear the the fans talking about put some uh uh pierce arrow  testimonials testimonials testimonials all right  test put in testes just for the fun of it testosterone test testimonial anything

[01:10:30]  differently and he knows vegetable medley come on yeah who doesn't like a good vegetable  fashion over function yeah exactly the original slogan was oh let me see uh hi to jim jim go ahead  what was the original slogan jim chandler the original the original slogan which they passed on  because they thought it was too much of a tongue twister was we're where with a question mark  we're where branson sorry very nice brother take care all right we're there uh branson is shitty but 
[01:11:00]  not at the same time what does that mean um branson is shitty but not not at the same time branson is  shitty but also not shitty at the same time oh branson is shitty but not at the same time is that your  slogan yeah branson you're listening you're listening to the worst of opian anthony the  worst of the opian anthony show serious xm so we feel like the bob or walter's a medal 
[01:11:30]  yeah it's like sitting down with tom snyder or something you know what i mean he's really going  to like dig into your life and talk nothing it's like when tom snyder interviewed kiss in 79 yeah  and h was hammered tom snyder gave a good interview dick cavett you know yes sir yes sir yes sir  fucking just smoking i was watching old clips of uh talk shows and and the the amount of cigarettes  that that were being smoked during those it was one my favorite one is on the twilight zone cds uh 
[01:12:00]  the dvds the collection uh they got interviews with rod sterling on the david suskind show i have that  they're smoking in this studio you at some points you can't see them and i literally can't see them  the the cameras are pulled so far back it's a big studio but they got ashtrays they're both smoking  so much and i think the crew is smoking and everything and there was just rolling clouds of  smoke in the entire room it's hilarious it looks like an episode of the twilight of the twilight zone yeah 
[01:12:30]  yeah dude my favorite thing in that interview is you watch this thing and you like i get really  nostalgic which show but i'm like oh that was a better time yes in television what a simple time  and then you watch this interview from 1959 or whatever rod sterling and he's going this  fucking business stinks i'm done with these executives they're morons every it just sounds  like comics at the cellar just they're miserable yeah i'll do this myself i'll produce it i'll do 
[01:13:00]  everything fuck them fuck them the business is the same yeah the business never changes never  changes he literally says in this interview and it's it's on the eve of the twilight zone coming out  with one of the greatest tv shows ever and he literally goes this is it this is my last ditch  effort i don't care anymore this is my life and it becomes the greatest thing the guy ever did but he is  at the end of his fucking rope he's like i can't stand this business it's it's it's insane  like an angry rod sterling yeah just bitter fucking he's been run through the mill rod sterling 
[01:13:30]  got to see this now it's a good interview man it's cool i do i go to youtube and watch like a  lot of the old fucking 70s oh yeah merv griffin show and mike douglas those clips are great they're  so hokey and weird and i know what they seem to have more fun on those shows yeah yeah now it's  more relaxed right now it's just about going on and plugging your shit and you know they didn't  need a reason to be on back then no they just sat down hey look who's in town let's uh let's let's 
[01:14:00]  let's see what's up yeah look at who's here with cigarettes and booze in hand and now you get like  you know someone that goes on like you know letterman or whatever like gwyneth paltrow and she  talks about her plane ride yeah and she's not a comic and it goes on for like seven minutes  just just nonsense there's not a good storyteller even hint of a joke nothing still nothing but  who was the guy that took the cigarettes away someone had a walk in one day and go look we  can't have i can't be smoking someone had it's fucking up our video units right well look what 
[01:14:30]  happened with kimmel remember kimmel when his show first came out drink and and and the first night  all right the audience members puked and they go that's it abc goes no drinking i gotta explain i was  part of that never was on kimmel but i would i was hanging out in la for a while and i would just hang  out in that back room because it was the greatest party ever yeah pool tables pinball machine hot  chicks there were so many celebrities that just showed up that weren't even booked for kimmel  just for the backstage shit and then they were feeding like you said the audience booze as well  it's it's it's sucks it's a great idea i know i wish you could still do you watch those old like 
[01:15:00]  dean martin clips yeah there's a dean martin thing with bob newhart where dean martin is playing a wig  salesman and he fucking is just in the tuxedo because he never changed for any of the sketches  why would he he's standing as a wig salesman in a tuxedo smoking a cigarette through the whole  fucking sketch and you're like this this was the shit yeah well you want to wear it do you yeah  he's laughing through the whole sketch this script 
[01:15:30]  i'm here to smoke and try to  that blonde singing these boots are made for walking they just went with it they just went  with the whole program carson would do all those fucking bits the mighty carson art players you know  you'd do those bits with the hot blondes and shit like that that now would just be so sexist and  racist and everything else and it was just hilarious yeah now you the every everybody's too worried  about what the fuck someone's gonna say you can't look at brad radnor you know he's doing a q a 
[01:16:00]  at a freaking wherever and yeah a throwaway line somebody's videotaping and now he's off the oscars  what do you say uh rehearsing's for fags yeah rehearsals for fags that whole eddie murphy  enough already resigned yeah yeah yeah we lost fucking eddie murphy it's uh reason for what  saying the word no no eddie what eddie eddie's just he's like ratner's guy it seems like he's  sticking up for a ratner brought him in what this is about brought him in as host he was like yeah  let's have eddie host so when he's gone eddie's like fuck this i'm out of here it's suck it's it's 
[01:16:30]  such an immature fucking argument like it's unbelievable to me that people would make such  a stink out of it and then i read this interview or this article about it where the guy that runs  glad or the president glad goes we sat down with brett and we talked to him and that his apology is just  the first of many public uh appearances he's going to make public floggings he'll know it's like  you literally sit you down like a 12 year old joe we've been on this for a while they they'll find  someone and then they'll take them hostage they hold them hostage like they held fucking tracy 
[01:17:00]  morgan tracy morgan they got we all know tracy morgan was that tracy morgan we saw on tv  i know having to sit down with everybody that was someone that was being held  fucking hostage would have gone fly back to nashville or wherever it was and apologize to  the crowd right was there tracy morgan i know i mean please my theory my theory is that that  many of these organizations are non-profits they get government funding and in order to keep that  easy money rolling in they've got to make a stink every year oh yeah and they don't want to make a 
[01:17:30]  stink over anything real this isn't a real fight if if you're gay rights proponent good we need to  have those but fighting over brett ratner saying fag and not meaning like that is not a fight for gay  rights joe as a gay bullshit fight and joe as a gay guy you weren't offended by that right yeah exactly  you want to fight for gay rights have a rally so i could suck a girl's cock and not worry about  it getting beat up afterwards but there's a cock loving straight right right and i mean when brett 
[01:18:00]  ratner said rehearsals for fags how many people really thought that meant you know nobody that's  my point oh a bunch of people that suck dick last such especially our age every i've never looked at  it that way every year like clockwork this happened last year with that with that ron howard movie uh  the dilemma whatever it was called wearing the thing everybody knows smart cars are gay right i  don't mean gay like homosexual guy i mean like dumb yeah right and they made a fucking huge stink about 
[01:18:30]  that and they pulled the ads and the movie fucking suffered and it's like guys you know  this is an easy stink to make to say hey everybody look we're still doing our job over here  please keep that money coming in the word has two meanings it has two meanings it's a derogatory  term for gay people and it's another word that everybody uses as being something you know not  quite up to fucking yeah manly status it's like the whole man up commercials now that's like that's 
[01:19:00]  the word a guy go oh you want to go to the bathroom with me oh come on man up you know so it's all  saying like you're a fag don't be a fag when you tell your fucking friends it's like hey let's go to  the fucking bar tonight it's like no i want to hang out it's like don't be a faggot get right  right come on out right it doesn't mean don't stay home and have gay sex so i can come in and beat you  up when i catch you that's that's not what that meant no i've been doing it wrong this whole time  it's like it's got two distinct meanings you know that's one of them is is derogatory which if it's 
[01:19:30]  used like hey i say we go out and beat up some fags all right that's now you now you got  something joe as a guy that sucks on man clit right yeah no it's it's it's it's it's it's an  incredibly immature argument and the fact that we can't get uh we can't come to terms as a culture  with the fact that words progress and words start to have different meaning booty being the classic 
[01:20:00]  example does not mean fucking pirate treasure anymore words change and nobody's saying that  there is not hatred or prejudice towards gay people there is but don't you know that's not  right yeah he didn't mean it like about intent yeah exactly you know the difference yeah everyone  knows what ratner meant everyone gets carried away though when you look at uh like uh sexual  harassment in the workplace uh it starts off as as the boss saying sit on my lap suck my dick i'll get  you a better job this that or the other thing that's sexual harassment when yeah when it when it's when 
[01:20:30]  it's you can't put some dumb fucking thing in your cubicle that shows like you know a scantily clad  girl or or a joke that you like in your cubicle that's not fucking sexual harassment in the workplace  so ridiculous it's not it's so far because a chick could put a fucking brad pitt without a shirt of  course right you know get a look at that every day they just turn it into something they they go the  to the extreme level where it's not what it was supposed to be it's not what it was intended to be in the  first place which was really to help people you know if there's any organization that wants to 
[01:21:00]  keep gay guys from getting their shit beat out of them because they're gay i'm all for it fine but  if it's you know all of a sudden now our language is being uh questioned and you got to worry about  having your job with no intent no ill intent against gay people it's ridiculous think about think about  how how how how fucking uh uh uh juvenile and and just truths oh how how fucking trivial this really 
[01:21:30]  is okay brett ratner said this thing people got angry about it what good did it do to force him to  step down from the oscars nothing one less gay person that'll be beat up i guess he stepped down from  the oscars but now everybody's happy with brett ratner and going come on brett uh you're doing the right  thing now what the fuck did that have to do couldn't he just said sorry and still kept his  goddamn job that's the world we live in you can't just say you're sorry they need sorry they need  punishment and repercussions and and some kind of uh uh thing your actions merit that you now lose your 
[01:22:00]  fucking gig well it's ridiculous everybody can be bought and if that's if that's the the the if  your price only goes as high as somebody not doing the fucking oscars this isn't a cause that's  that's fucking embarrassing take a goddamn stand and if you're really mad at him go hey go fuck  yourself ratner no no you're not on our team you're a fucking asshole but they won't do that because  they're it's mob political fucking cocksuckers no pun intended 
[01:22:30]  excluded yeah takes one to know one i guess no it's it's just shit it doesn't work the pot calling the  kettle a cocksucker it does more damage than than good it does more damage than good when you fight these  petty fucking issues it damages the people you're trying to help and protect yeah it doesn't help  them it it absolutely doesn't yes slow clap absolutely look the bottom line is in 10 years  from now whatever word they're using for gay whatever's acceptable and my friend goes i just 
[01:23:00]  went to a broadway show and i saw a dance and i i kind of liked it i'm using that word i'm using that  word i don't give a fuck whatever whatever you want to change it to i'm using that right right  it doesn't matter we're gonna be able to keep up yeah exactly homo can't use any of them fag okay  whatever you go whatever you're gonna have in 10 years i'm using that i'm a big fan of the old  school uh queer you know what i like that word i've been using a lot on stage now it's kind of  like honky but you're a little light in the loafers light in the loafers it sounds fun it does it's a 
[01:23:30]  little floaty floaty so well and like fruity is a great example fruit used to mean gay you'd say  hey you fruit he'd say he's a fucking fruit that meant he was gay now you can say fruity and people  go oh that means that he's a little goofy or a little off or a little crazy with it nobody cares  that is not a gay slur anymore yeah archie bunkie used to use fruit all the time i think he's a fruit  he would say something like that it meant gay fairy didn't he oh fairy yeah yeah geez 
[01:24:00]  dear yeah why did you suck everyone knows england is a fag country when he said that it's like  brilliant england is a fag country we understood what he meant what was russell's no my friends  and i use dancer as code for gay oh because if we said yo that guy's gay they'd be like like oh he's  not cool no see yeah because gaming's not cool he's a fucking dancer oh he's gay gotcha oh that makes  more sense you know what i mean it actually does make more sense he's a dancer oh okay you referenced 
[01:24:30]  it so we gotta play some archie we love playing archie bump on this show which uh what do you got  just because a guy is sensitive and and he's an intellectual and he wears glasses you make him out  of queer i never said a guy who wears glasses is a queer a guy who wears glasses is a four eyes a guy  who's a fag is a queen that's funny that was on television i know jesus christ i was on television  not only was it on television it was when we only had three fucking channels could you imagine trying 
[01:25:00]  to get that past anyone today on television you absolutely could a guy that's a fag is a queer  you want one more it's brilliant oh yeah you all know roger and we all know he's straight and even  if he wasn't and i said if what difference would that make do you know that in many countries england  for instance there is a law that says whatever two consenting adults do in private is their own  business listen this ain't england we threw england out of here a long time ago we don't want no more 
[01:25:30]  part of england for your information england is a fag country jesus what say are they still picking  handkerchiefs out of their sleeve huh are they still standing around leaning on them skinny umbrellas  like this here i know the whole society is based on a kind of a fag though you know you're right archie  you're right the british are a bunch of pansies pansies fairies and sissies and the japanese are a 
[01:26:00]  race of midgets the irish are boozers the mexicans are bandits and you polacks are meatheads  kind of a fagdom that was on what child was uh cbs was it cbs cbs cbs and now we have to watch  that in front of the whole family the whole family would watch it and they would play stuff like that  with the shitty sitcoms that we have to fucking well i don't know the new ones oh yeah it's just  great in the golden era of tv hopefully that was just and like to think you couldn't put that 
[01:26:30]  shit on fucking fx now you couldn't put it on you could barely put it on hbo exactly yeah it's it  would have to be like somebody who's really evil and you'd have to show them as being evil and they  have to die at the end in a horrible way that guy was the fucking he was the lovable guy on the show  fx you rooted for him of course fx is pushing some envelopes it's always sunny this year went to a few  places where i was like holy shit yeah i like always they're doing some things yeah but they're 
[01:27:00]  on fx the looting thing did you see the looting thing no i'm behind they were showing they were  watching clips uh the daily videos trying to explain that the media just spins everything  and they're watching clips of the of the la riots with rodney king and then of the of what happened in  with the with the hurricane in uh in katrina yeah and uh he goes it's showing all the white people in  new orleans and he goes now would you see these people are surviving or looting and she goes they're 
[01:27:30]  they're surviving they're like getting what they need and then he plays rodney king cliff and it's  all these black people running out of the story he goes what are they doing she goes they're looting  and he goes yeah see that's how the media spent spends it when it's white people it's survival  when it's black people it's looting and she goes no the black people are looting because they're  carrying television sets and he goes how do you know those television sets don't have napkins  bread and toilet paper inside of them but i was just like jesus christ man that was a ballsy 
[01:28:00]  fucking joke that's kind of bold yeah we uh especially in this fucking dumb day and age eric  has one more he says oh okay why not not only that i had michael read him too mike it ain't enough  that he's a pinko and an atheist you're gonna turn him from a man into a morphodite  what's a morphodite a freak with a little too much of each and not a number neither 
[01:28:30]  oh that's great man how sad do you remember that episode  when archie saved that woman who was choking or something and gave her mouth to mouth oh it turned  out to be a guy yeah yeah a fucking guy see joe see remember that one right yeah yeah how how  fucking get right in there sad were all you guys because it kills me every time you watch that show  and you love it so much and then you watch an interview with carol o'connor oh my god and he's  just like well uh when we did the character and you're like yeah no oh he was the complete 
[01:29:00]  opposite in real life do archie do the voice he's a liberal guy leading heart liberal and  he adopted a black kid didn't yeah yeah or was that just a tv show yeah i think it was a tv show  did you ever see the uh series finale uh no by that point that yeah because it went to archie  bunker's plays or something it went to shit he turned into like he's he wasn't even archie anymore yeah  the uh the series finale make you cry no guarantee it'll make you cry no it won't it will why not

[01:30:00]  that can travel to your brain you could die right but she doesn't tell archie because she's scared  to tell him and he's running her all over the place making her cook and shit these awful special  episodes no no it was funny the whole time it was funny it was they made it comedic the laughs they  made it comedic i'm like a funny blood clot yeah and then in the jamaican sense i mean  but you guys forget it you this is gonna bob i know where this is going no we're listening joe 
[01:30:30]  when did they start the uh don't stop believing music end of the episode she finally tells him  and he gets mad at her for not telling him yeah punches her in the face and they're laying in bed  and he finally drops the whole facade and he goes i've been running my mouth for a long time but i  ain't nothing without you and he tells her he loves her for the first time and it's it's the end and  and you just see the human in him for one second and you're like there it is but i don't want it  that's what the whole show was about was how he is a loud mouth but he depends on her and he really 
[01:31:00]  does he is a little scared we can figure it out without it spoon-fed to us we knew he needed to  eat it how about we go out at the end i'm like all right that's a better end i thought she was blue  in the bed get me all crying over here yeah through your tears right all right absolutely crying over  here i didn't know i was in here with a bunch of barbarians yes well mr sensitive cocksucker  yeah we just held you for an hour and a half for your decision making what do you think

[01:32:30]  and hijacking and it was uh yeah it was on a hijacking and how to prevent hijacking right bring  all the planes everyone bring a gun everyone yeah bring a gun they hand out the you hand out your heaters  when everyone gets on the plane here's what he's got here's the clip jesus he's not prepared wow  good evening everybody this is archie bunker of 704 houses street veteran of the big war speaking on  behalf of guns for everybody now question what was the first thing that the communists done when they 
[01:33:00]  took over in russia answer gun control and there's a lot of people in this country want to do the same  thing to us here in a kind of conspiracy seat take your big international bankers uh they want to  what do you call masticate the people of this nation like puppets on a wing and then we get that done  and train us over to the communists he's fucking great it's hilarious the way he's just talking the  writing is great the acting is fantastic he's got the second part all right now i want to talk about 
[01:33:30]  another thing that's on everybody's mind today and that's your stickups in your skyjackings which uh  if that was up to me i could end the skyjackings tomorrow all you got to do is arm all your passengers  and maybe you got no more superiority there he ain't gonna dare to pull out no rod rod and then your  airlines then they wouldn't have to chase the passengers on the ground no more they just pass out 
[01:34:00]  the pistols at the beginning of the trip now they put them up again at the end it's brilliant case  closed case closed jesus man yeah pass out the fucking guns at the uh beginning of the trip  i get so mad at people sometimes you'll talk to somebody and they'll go you know what's your  favorite show you are on the family and they'll go uh it's just it's so racist and i go you don't  understand the show yeah the beauty of that show was they had the guy that was completely left and the  guy that was completely right and the two guys pointed out the flaws and the other guy's 
[01:34:30]  character perfectly balanced fucking character is perfectly balanced it's like it's like when  people watch the honeymooners and go i don't like it because he says he's gonna hit his wife and it's  like well yeah part do you keep watching when she tells him to shut his fat mouth yeah never you  never hit her that and the mother-in-law too i love when he cocks his fist back goes you dirty  you he's just gonna fucking pop her in the face when he swallows it when he just go when she goes  yeah the biggest thing around here are your pants and he just goes 
[01:35:00]  like when the mother-in-law just turns to him and goes oh why don't you shut up  like people just talk to each other like shit back then  every sitcom should be like that 29 minutes of insults and then they make up at the end  the last minute i love you i love you too and that's it  hey we'll see you next week what was the final what was the final episode of the honeymooners  how did they go out they the original episode alice had a blood clot yeah she finally got punched in 
[01:35:30]  the face yeah i think i really do love you in the beginning of the show instead of the end yeah  i think out of the original episodes it was the one where he was the super of the building  uh but there was no finale no back then they didn't go for the big finale right the show just kind  of ended well it wasn't really he did the show but he did it on the it was a sketch that he did on  the jackie gleason show yeah and then they said we want to do a sitcom and he goes look i'm doing  30 and that's it one and done he that's all he wanted to do that's why it's called like when you  i have the box it's called like the classic 32 or whatever the fuck and that was it and then they 
[01:36:00]  kept bringing it back it got really bad you ever see the one in the 70s where it's like a musical  it's terrible who's the wife in it it's like uh what's her name mccray or it's i don't know but it's  hilarious because when mccray oh yeah might as well be gleason and art carney kept getting grayer  and fatter yeah and older and they just kept replacing the get out of here you old bag and  bring it in some new 25 year old oh sheila sheila mccray was his wife no they just got any hollywood 
[01:36:30]  redhead to uh sit in yeah yeah it was it was in color too right awful yeah it was in color they  should have kept it in black and white and but they sing songs ope yeah yeah that's they break  it was bad it was bad his gambling money and he was bad he was drunk yeah he needed the money he  wanted to fuck sheila mccray he was quite the womanizer they give a fuck yeah his face was on  the wall of every diner in miami he's like yeah fuck it we'll do another tv show why not all right 
[01:37:00]  yeah get it started the great one i don't care if you burn  great show i love the love boat ah yeah the love boat when you when you look at shows like the  honeymoon is uh it's like that was in the 50s and it's still the same fucking premise in 90 of the  sitcoms they got the you know the funny couple is going on husband with a wife yeah with the hot  wife that's too hot for him the the wacky neighbors the fucking set is the apartment and 
[01:37:30]  you know shit like that coming in and out of the door all the time yeah it just that it didn't  change from that i love lucy same fucking thing dude you watch you watch king of queens and you  can see that it he was hugely influenced by the honeymooners yeah you know yeah same thing he  doesn't drive a bus he drives a ups truck right fat guy he's got a lippy wife that cuts him down  all the time for him yeah it's way way too hot for him fat they were just too scared to call it  the new honeymooners yeah yeah you know yeah he's doing the honeymooners yeah no one did 
[01:38:00]  come off with an original fucking idea right all this time at least a fucking love boat was on a  boat right and there was love something i had ted i did a christmas special in canada and i had ted  lange on my show nice your bartender yeah he played he played isaac he played the bartender yeah  he shot the guns yes at the beginning oh it was always uh so thrilling to see who would hook up when  you saw which stars were there it's like oh okay yeah oh look at that we got yeah suzanne summers is 
[01:38:30]  on this episode i wonder who she's gonna hook up with great for whacking too as well oh yeah yeah  yeah because they were always in a little bikinis and stuff they'd go out to the the promenade deck  yeah a shuffleboard on the lido deck yes wonderful yeah it was a good show my favorite episode was when  uh robert wagner uh throat fuck sophia loray that was a good one that was a good one go for go for 
[01:39:00]  walked in on him yeah fucking tagged her from behind yeah like cards on her back  and then they got stuck there that was great  it was uh i was talking about this show last night was barney miller funny i don't remember  wow at the time i remember it being funny when when it was on i kind of remember it being funny  but now i don't think it would hold up at all yeah no it's it was uh too dry yeah oh who didn't  like the bass riff though i think yeah even how cool the music was was how cool the show was trying 
[01:39:30]  to be what was the style of humor i haven't literally haven't seen it since i was six years  old i don't remember it at all i don't remember that one it was very dry i think it was very dry  yeah i'm with an on that uh ensemble fucking humor i think abe vegoda would get a line in every now  and then yeah i gotta go bernice is waiting for me hey fish and they were always sending people  in and out of the place yeah yeah funny line too yeah i i don't know it it was a weird show and then 
[01:40:00]  they would have people in the jail cell and they'd be doing bits with him back and forth it's like like  they wrote shit you know it's like no this guy's just in the fucking holding cell and he's  he's hilarious okay can you stop doing a two-hander with the rapist  yeah they're doing tag it fucking improvs in the fucking all right freeze  give me a situation a job and uh 
[01:40:30]  i love shows like that where the cops and the crooks are just all buddies  yeah they do that it's just a job yeah you know it's just a job yeah it's it's and i remember  people saying when that show is out it's whoa it's one of the most realistic depictions of a  precinct uh on television because before that was like adam 12 and shit like that but it's like no  that's what really goes on and then nypd blue shows up and you're like oh okay this is the most  realistic fiction yeah that's like the only thing before bernie miller was car 54 yeah 
[01:41:00]  any cop show where the cops scratched his head with the barrel of his gun  well i don't know we might as well lock them all up scratching his head with his 38  i always love that move oh well then you also had that uh the mod squad and they remember they  didn't carry guns no guns they're groovy what was that need to carry guns they didn't explain  that no they were a hippie gunman yeah they were the black guy alternative the white hippie guy 
[01:41:30]  and and uh the the girl yeah julie lipped in yeah she was hot yeah all right she was actually  married to link i think right really she was fucking him nice yeah yeah oh yeah she loved that  black cock oh it bothered me back then i used to have to switch it off and go to mannix yeah  she was gonna change her last name to big lipton oh yeah yeah let the complaints fly in there were  so many of those great quid martin productions back then canon and mannix and uh canon what the

[01:44:30]  opian anthony show serious xm okay what happened what a fucking what a fucking war i started on  twitter yesterday not oh my god was that real oh yeah i meant it but i didn't i didn't uh  it's funny how people reacted i wanted to jump in and just bash you you know why are you saying  i don't like him i never liked him you don't like bill murray never liked bill murray but i don't i  don't think bill murray like i have to he's obviously a good actor and he's good at what  he does i just never enjoyed him i think i jumped in your twitter fight halfway through so i was really 
[01:45:00]  confused so walk us through this i watched in stripes yesterday and i and at first i was like this is  terrible and then i'm like the first half of stripes good though that's how i remember it the whole  movie has hilarious parts it like that's why i didn't just twitter stripes sucks i actually began to  right like i forgot how bad this movie was i'm like no no everybody's good in this except for  bill murray and fucking harold ramus i didn't like them yes yes sir that that's you know he goes uh  john larriquette was great when he's like well we're on our way to bingo parlor and larriquette  goes again shut up okay sir okay sir okay sir or when the fucking russians come up to the back of 
[01:45:30]  the truck and they all have guns pointed at each other and john kenny goes all right all right all right  pass it forward dude do some rules fucking laugh out loud but i always fucking never liked bill  murray i didn't like him in caddyshack and that's sacrilege but i never liked bill murray um  you know it just you didn't like no caddyshack did he have a couple good moments yeah but i hated that 
[01:46:00]  whole fucking gopher storyline it was stupid to me yeah hated and uh yeah they just needed something to  tie that movie together about goofing on fucking country clubs lost in translation i thought was  boring people keep naming these movies i didn't see like a lot of people are naming this one that  one i didn't see a lot of them um the artsy bill murray movies that he's put out uh later in his  career i can't fucking sit through yeah i can't sit through those fucking things the azuzu one oh my god  what the fuck was that about azuzu i don't know but i'm trying to remember i i remember liking stripes i'll 
[01:46:30]  tell you why when this stupid little thing he plays himself in a lot of the earlier movies he  does and can he be funny yeah because in ghostbusters hated i'll tell you right the  fuck now we've said on the air ghostbusters does not hold up i'm sorry i saw it recently  it's a pile of shit yeah yeah it's a pile of shit well that's a movie and and it goes against  something else we talk about on the show a lot i wouldn't mind if they remade ghostbusters 
[01:47:00]  which makes me hypocritical is harold ramus in that yep yeah he is yeah i hated their combo  dumb voice that movie is horrible it is you don't like his kermit the frog no he's  fucking not charismatic i'm you know again he's a serviceable actor but he's not and then people get  it's amazing like and maybe i do the same thing but i said i don't like bill murray i think and  people like he's funnier than you it's like i'm not saying i'm funnier than bill murray that's  i just don't like him yeah exactly the people don't know how to argue and people unfollow like 
[01:47:30]  that's a punishment go fuck yourself unfollow hey i will not read what you write who gives a  shit i'm not paid by the person on twitter you faggots i don't give a fuck unfollow  why don't you really protest and fucking hang yourself with my picture hanging up there you go  fucking jizz bags there you go oh i love when they think they're punishing me by not don't even tell 
[01:48:00]  me just let my numbers dwindle yeah i don't give a fuck oh god that's great but it's amazing your day  is going to be ruined because they are unfollowing i literally get the fuck out of here it is an  impossibility for me to be less concerned than i am i could give a fuck but the fact that people  get so mad it was funny to me like they really are mad so you were watching stripes and then you  had a tweet that you just didn't like i always i'll tell you one thing that drove me nuts and this is  not bill murray or howard ramis's fault is when they all get their crew cuts how everyone gets a 
[01:48:30]  crew cut but those two still kind of keep their hairstyles but sure that fucking drove me nuts  you're right they can't commit they can't commit to the movie role oh it drove me nuts i wish you would  i wish you you would have texted me i would have i would have uh watched stripes just so i could be more  in this conversation because i remember the movie being pretty good the first half there's a couple  of moments where i know exactly what jimmy's talking about there's a couple of moments i like  when they went to the recruiting center and they were asking the questions like are you gay and he's 
[01:49:00]  like you mean flaming yeah yeah yeah a couple of lines like that yeah the push-up thing was kind of  funny because he couldn't fucking do one push-up yeah but yeah this harold ramus finally realized i'm not  quite the guy that really needs to be the actor yeah i'm gonna go behind the camera uh yeah and  watching these two in those fucking horrendous scenes with sean young and fucking pj souls  those fucking terrible scenes where these two fours are fooling around the fucking hot mps go 
[01:49:30]  fuck yourself you didn't answer my treatment stupid stroke mouth ah he's got a special under her  hiney oh fuck you you nerds you fucking bill murray nerds i'm not mad if you like bill murray but the  ones that were so fucking defensive of bill murray just fucking crush up glass and eat it they really  were defensive okay oh it's fucking murray's had a really strange movie career yeah he's really an  amazing career pretty much i mean caddyshack is a great range yeah caddyshack i love he was okay 
[01:50:00]  in that i just did i to me of what ted knight was great and fucking and rodney and and that's another  movie where bill murray is detached from the entire movie like it that his scenes are all a separate  movie yeah because we're going with the little fuckers right theme it's another one where it's almost  like did they film that after they filmed everything else just drove me nuts how fucking you know  you know what's funny when john larroquette walks in and the fucking and and the uh the rv is gone 
[01:50:30]  he goes who the fuck's my truck like i i'm glad i didn't bash the movie because there were some  fucking like moments that still made me laugh but most of them were john candy or john larroquette  like john candy is one of the funniest guys ever yeah what about the whole lighten up francis  fucking warren oates was great yeah uh the fucking moron guys call me the cruiser  oh god cruiser yeah just a dolt no it's customary for you to make my bunk now if i was enjoying it 
[01:51:00]  i'd have to make your bunk because right away it's your bunk and i still whenever whenever i uh  whenever i trip over something like an idiot i always turn around point and say have that removed  and then i'm going to bed last night and young frankenstein's on and gene wilder one of the  that movie was hilarious but people just would got so mad yeah i thought you lost your mind  yesterday no i just i'm not a big like i said i got in the i i i was late to the party i wasn't  that bad he's losing his fucking mind today people do why are you in such a bad mood but i'm like i 
[01:51:30]  really wasn't and then i saw fucking the uh the blackberry that fucking tablet and it just made me  angry all over again i just attack people who use blackberry and it's like i it's like i'm attacking  you guys why that's i feel bad for you like you're being no that's the ipad killer i i loved uh your  battles yesterday it was so much fun to read yeah it really were but i love when people i do some guys  that smashed me and that were really funny and i actually retweeted them yeah yeah but guys are 
[01:52:00]  just being cunts like unfollow yeah well bill murray's one of those guys he's just he's just like beloved  i guess he's what were you doing back in 1980 exactly nothing same thing i'm doing now hating  bill murray didn't we do this recently trying to figure out the last uh good movie he was in  and you go way back yeah it's it's it's let's go uh quite a ways back groundhog day i never saw all  of it was what i saw was pretty good but i liked but he played a straight guy in that really straight 
[01:52:30]  man he didn't have a lot of jokes in that movie did he i remember not really kingpin was hilarious  that was very funny he was great in that right the fuck somebody mentioned that and i was like  yeah he was really funny that i like that groundhog yeah movie i don't know i just didn't like him  in stride like his hair and stripes the fact that he wouldn't get a crew cut yeah i'd be  fucking crazy he was already losing his hair and he was probably scared it was never going to grow back  he was good in edward oh yeah okay he was was he more serious than that or he's playing a gay guy yeah  yeah i play like kind of a gay guy and stuff and it was good one of one of the edward's cronies 
[01:53:00]  that was good yeah the fucking movie's fantastic i forgot he was in that like i didn't say bill  murray has no talent he just annoyed me in fucking did you see stripes you've seen what about bob right  i with dreyfus yes been a long time i like that movie yeah i haven't seen that one people kept  mentioning movies i was like oh yeah that one oh yeah that one like there were some ones i forgot  about you had a bunch of hits jimmy yeah let's go to darren in canada darren hey um i just was gonna 
[01:53:30]  mention i got i kind of know why bill murray was acting um the way he did on uh caddyshack  like for that character carl yeah he uh he just did um where the buffalo room where he was playing  hunter s thompson and if you watch that and then watch caddyshack you can pretty much see where that  carl character kind of came from all right all right so he took a little uh a little something from that  other movie yeah it just it kind of messes a guy up when they play hunter s thompson like look at 
[01:54:00]  johnny depp he did that for fear and loathing and then look at him as uh captain jack they're on pirates  same kind of thing all right there you go thank you darren even growing up i never really  found bill murray i remember my ex-girlfriend many many years ago we talk about him he's like i just  don't like him that's like the late 80s i never loved bill murray you don't like him on snl  i don't remember him all swarmy and shit yeah i mean look i'm sure he had some funny what he was 
[01:54:30]  doing didn't oh that was ackroyd and steve moore that did that yeah again again i don't say i never  liked ackroyd in the blues brothers he was great and he was good in neighbors like he had some with  i was never a huge fan of his early uh snls man ackroyd was was pretty funny yeah i agree they gave him  some when the writing was really cutting edge and funny and and shit and for the time but they gave him  some good shit but then when he moved into movies yeah not not so much no he had a couple absolutely 
[01:55:00]  oh god what movie was that nothing but trouble that was horrible nothing but trouble that was  horrible where he had the dick nose they put it they put dan ackroyd they put the dick nose on  him and trouble is never trouble is a ruiner of movies like if that's in the title your movie's  probably going to be a fucking heinous trouble who's in it uh uh demi moore uh john oh john  candy okay fucking uh oh dan ackroyd and jerry young frankenstein that gene hackman scene is the blind 
[01:55:30]  man oh come in a friend is fucking hysterical he's gonna pour soup on his dick twice  and the fucking creature just wants a fucking glass of wine and the camera set up and and  fucking peter boyle is holding his coffee mug and he says uh toast and he fucking smashes his glass  oh i fucking laughed out loud watching that alone yeah that's hysterical man that was a funny movie

[01:57:30]  hurting you by kicking and screaming it's like i don't give a fuck it's very funny  all right there you go but i was i was surprised by how people reacted bill murray had a bunch of hits  and then a bunch of weird movies i forget how it even started honestly i just it just i happened to  watch ghostbusters again uh wow that's a bother that's a rough one um fuck i mean let me just  find the uh bothered the first one oh this was a one guy wrote uh wow you have a lot of opinion

[01:59:00]  actually i i will stand correct i should not have said not a good movie i i kept watching after i wrote  that it was very funny yeah except for him i was distracted by the kickball story we're doing after  the break what did you just say at the end i was saying that i i did actually say i shouldn't have  written if i could redo that what movie was it again stripes okay so you started enjoying stripes  after you wrote i was watching a bill murray scene just going and john candy wasn't wasn't  embarrassing in that movie what's hilarious and so john larriquette was very underrated as far as 
[01:59:30]  pj souls how good he was in that movie dumb fucking lusterless hair  the answer my treatment watch that somebody watch i know i stink we'll start for the record got it  and sean young is awful and she's fucking horrible her and horrendous harold ramus i'm supposed to have  interest in these two fucking zilches you know when she was great when gene hackney was throwing  her off the fucking balcony and no way out that was that's when she was great when she was  fucking falling to her death into a fishbowl that was the omen sorry you're listening to the 
[02:00:00]  worst of the opian anthony show serious xm let's do this pat oswald in studio uh young adult charlise  uh they're on oh are you a leading man now patten i'm a lucky co-star about the best i'll ever be  is she just beautiful in person is she yeah she is i mean she you know she's it's weird it's like 
[02:00:30]  she reminds me of she's she's really really beautiful and really really super talented and  genuinely funny so it's that it's that john ham tension where it's like hot and funny you pick  one you don't get to have yeah yeah you can't why are you what the fuck you you can't i what did i just  pick spelling you know what this sucks because you know so yeah i just yeah it's like it's like  she's there to to to remind you that life can be really unfair insanely unfair what is the movie 
[02:01:00]  who's in a movie with her though in a movie yeah well it's this come on she plays this woman named  mavis gray who who writes these young adult novels like like like think of a sweet valley high  thing and she goes back to her hometown it's actually kind of cool because it starts off like your  standard boring rom-com which is i'm going to go back and win back this my high school sweetheart  and then you realize about 15 minutes into it that she's mentally damaged and it turns into kind of 
[02:01:30]  a horror movie i mean it's still funny but it's this thing where i think it was diablo cody going  you know the behavior in romantic comedies are what psychopaths it's not this cute fun thing it's  what damaged people do right and and also what's so great about it it has that early 70s  feel of we are going to follow this character down there's no arc where at the end she's like  there's a scene at the end between her and this actress named colette wolf plays my sister comes  out of nowhere and it's so stunning where you're like i can't believe that's how we're ending it 
[02:02:00]  this is so ballsy what they just pulled off i'll just again i'm maybe i'm doing a weird job promoting  it because they're basically saying it's a very very dark comedy and there's no redemption at all  but uh the the end scene when you realize what is happening you're like oh my god that's holy  shit this is awesome that sounds great though yeah it's about a horrible person that gets way worse 
[02:02:30]  right and and manages to live being even worse because i mean i remember i was talking to dabble about  this and she goes well you know in real life people have epiphanies all the time now in movies  people have an epiphany and they change their life but in real life you have epiphanies and you're like  oh so i do that because my dad um acted there oh okay well i'm just going to keep doing that  at least i know why i do it right yeah i know why i'm like it doesn't mean i'm gonna change yeah i'll 
[02:03:00]  remember the whole theme is like assholes don't change they just sort of stay assholes i like that you  used to turn ballsy because sometimes hollywood's not ballsy with their shit uh well you know make  it all nice at the end well the whole reason that i i think jason reitman's he told me that he did  the script because the only the reason i'm shooting this is so that someone else won't shoot it and  fuck it up like i'm doing this so i can defend the ending that she has on this because again there's  this very crucial scene that any other studio would have gone that's not gonna that's not your ending 
[02:03:30]  and he's like no no that is our ending this is where it goes and you're like holy shit  it that's not gonna test well yeah yeah well they uh we we played it at a uh at the sun coast  mall and a lot of the soccer moms were very upset that uh why don't uh couldn't she have a night  you know meet a nice sailor and maybe he has a little oyster fishery or something or  that's been around too long it's called young adult it comes out next friday all right you sold it man 
[02:04:00]  did i yes i want to see this movie now just because it's different see it for charlie's you  you cannot believe how absolutely evil she is in this movie well how about this well who do you play  in the movie uh that's some asshole but she is no i play a guy that is that stayed in the hometown and  he got beaten up in high school he was called the hate crime guy because a bunch of jocks thought he  was gay beat the crap out of him now his leg is all fucked up um turns out he's not he was not gay 
[02:04:30]  it was all a mistake so he's this really bitter me but he's so kind of bitter about stuff and and  about life that he forms his friendship he had he had the locker next to charlie's the whole  high school and she doesn't remember him so it's just this total kick in the nuts but he because he  doesn't give a shit anymore he could just call her on her crap and then she kind of was like oh  i've never had a guy it's almost that that that unspoken thing of like guys who look like you 
[02:05:00]  don't normally talk to me that way so i'm gonna i'm now i'm weirdly she's fascinated with me like  she's for discovered a new species a bug like the fuck is this you know so it's really i mean again  it's it's it's very it's gonna be i i'm i'm happy that i'm in the movie but i'm even more excited as a  film buff to watch how the studio is going to sell this because it's going to be a really hard sell  oh wow but it's going to be really fascinating when when because some of the reviews are so 
[02:05:30]  positive and they have that same thing of like i can't fucking believe they went where they went  with this thing every time a movie does that it's well received every time it does well every time  damn it yeah that exactly that is what drives me crazy is every time there's some big breakout hit  it's because they did some ballsy thing and then that all that does is make more imitators until  someone else comes along and does the next ballsy thing when you fuck with that formula that they  have it seems to be a hit i mean it seems like it i mean like i typically like the mcconaughey uh 
[02:06:00]  romantic comedies you know i find it to be charming and yeah yeah he's so good hey hey uh hey jimmy  keep on living buddy hey guys guys let me take my shirt off here hang on here we go  exactly yeah wow that's good no yeah so you like the mcconaughey for me  just do you like to curl up with a good mcconaughey on a rainy on a rainy night  get a fire going i didn't have a fireplace just the end of the bed 
[02:06:30]  i've always said as long as the cover has him and a girl back to back looking over the  shoulders you know you got a good film you know you got a good one maybe she's got the scarf around  his neck like you're not going anywhere yeah yeah yeah oh wait a minute i wonder hang on  because someone there there's a i remember there was this video store and they had a section of  because they it was it was kind of going out of business so they did this section and it was called  shade tipping and it was all of the covers of movies where someone's going like this 
[02:07:00]  looking over the top of the top there's there's literally like 50 of those but you just the one  where the the man and the woman are standing back and she's kind of has some kind of i i actually now  i'm thinking of like four or five movies with that image there's a million of them yeah yeah exactly  that whole can you believe what am i gonna do she's she's in charge for love or money  yeah janey just discovered a new four-letter word dave 
[02:07:30]  i saw but i saw that something online it was a movie posters and movie uh covers there's a lot  of different themes they use over and over again there was giant head in sky where it's like yeah  the guy's on the beach and you see like he's a little picture of him walking on the beach and  then in the sky is just his head his face and also there's this hang on well i don't know why  i'm doing this radio but but there's a lot of this on posters hang on the whole he's facing 
[02:08:00]  looking back over the shoulder looking over the shoulder yes oh good you worked your lats yeah  so we should go see this okay we should find that website because there's a whole bunch of them  yeah they have a bunch of themes they really nailed it who could grab the computer for us iraq when  they're tangled up in things i like when they're like christmas ones where they're tangled up in the  the lights and the christmas lights oh my goodness and those are the ones where it's so clear that  the star was like no i'm not doing that so they just slapped his head yeah on a different body like 
[02:08:30]  they don't even try to hide the fact that we need you to drive out to this uh photo guy in westwood  no i'm not not doing that just put my get get a publicity photo put my head on there take a picture  yeah yeah grab a shot i already have yeah i'm not doing that that never occurred to me that they  probably do that you're probably right though oh absolutely we got to go there now  it's uh were you listening movie posters how they use the same themes yeah it made i forgot what  website it made but there's a whole bunch because we always talked about the back-to-back but then  this this site yeah there's so many holy crap yeah and you didn't realize oh go ahead pat i'm sorry 
[02:09:00]  no no you you were just saying that there's also this there's these weird color schemes like all  comedies now it's a white poster with big red letters every single comment that means comedy it's  it's almost like you know what the movie is if you're 50 yards away right just by color  coded probably a comedy and then all the action movies it's like gold and green next to each  other mixed or purple and yellow i never noticed that yes all right here's the first one uh tiny 
[02:09:30]  people on the beach giant heads in the clouds oh my god that's the one and had whoa tiny people  tiny people with giant heads in the clouds you're not kidding and uh let's move on to the next one  yeah there's plenty they are such formulaic uh uh which one is this sexy back i told you  there you go oh sexy back you nailed it there it is they're all looking over their shoulder sexy  back what were some of the movies that used sexy back harry potter blade harry potter blades 
[02:10:00]  a lot of all the resident evils watchmen yep shoot them up everyone's like looking over their  shoulder all right let's move on to the next one these are hilarious because it's uh it's great  what a great idea oh the famous back-to-back there is disgust yeah this is the one we noticed oh my  god they could there's and there's gyms they're tangled up in the what's gonna happen is that a  piece of shit which one is that on second one under pretty woman wait they use it christmases  oh you know what it's not fair to put observe and report on there where is that right there 
[02:10:30]  oh my god they were mocking that they had to be mocking yeah yeah totally yeah um oh my god  and yeah you've got wow that that's pretty adam's rib that's how old that is yeah wow yeah look at  that which one's the guy leaning is that mcconaughey it looks like nobody nobody leans as hot as  mcconaughey that's a hot lean man he's got the lean down he's got that lean buddy i think they make  fun of uh denzel washington in this uh series of posters too well there's another thing where 
[02:11:00]  stars clearly go you can shoot this side of my face but not this other one yeah yeah so you only  get the the certain side oh through the legs between the legs it's a james bond thing yeah my james bond  the graduate uh what else is on this list god i i shudder to think of if jim norton ever got to  start a movie what his between the legs shot would exactly nice baby skirt two balls  my father weeping in the corner all right i've got my eye on you oh 
[02:11:30]  just the eyeball once they put them all together like this you're like come on yeah did anyone think  like it could you come up with avatar did the eyeball who else is up there just for the people  out there uh well avatar bionic woman the eye of course all the candy man movies yeah yeah chucky  chucky good old chucky yeah yeah is that what people is that what people know about chucky oh  yeah that eye that eye that he has come on man i think the best movie poster ever though was um 
[02:12:00]  i love trouble oh god that was terrible oh i love trouble nature and blue yeah nature and blue  i love showing the ocean and just blue water and blue clouds go back to orange and purple that's  what i was talking about there's these two colors that go to oh black and orange sorry there there  is black and orange see black with a little slice of orange in there for the fire wow see 
[02:12:30]  die hard expendables ghost ride wow that really is like the same yeah go down further because  there's one there's these two colors it's for every action movie keep going keep going  uh oh women text in your face no okay well there's another one where all the action movies use like  green and orange together and that means action movie right go back is the denzel washington on this  website no oh because they beat the shit out of him i'm trying to remember exactly what they did 
[02:13:00]  because he gets the same variation the same shot for all his posters oh is it really yeah oh you know  his same face yeah the same like angle the same like because he's like this is this is my best  look yeah he likes the one side of his face better or something like that so oh wow look up just just  google uh denzel denzel washington posters sam denzel look up denzel's posters 
[02:13:30]  yeah i mean he's always kind of looking over his shoulder he's got a tiny guy big head in the  clouds i forgot what they said about he likes the left side of his face obviously oh he does oh yeah  yeah yeah i wonder if you could do a chart where you go okay which ones were hits okay there's a  left side of his face the ones that didn't make money right on yeah right they must have done a  chart and go okay from now on left side of the face right side we lose money i think they did that  with karate uh movies oh yeah was it how to design a denzel washington move uh yeah look at that 
[02:14:00]  yep got his big head there looking around looking over text on very intense he is he is an intense  actor though that guy i mean i he he's he's so deserved his oscar for training day because he  took kind of a b-minus movie and elevated it to this other you know i mean like that's how good  the performance was yeah you know what i'm saying like that that's the sign of a guy when they take  material and go okay i'm gonna run with this who did they screw that year because i i thought they  should have given it to him for x but i think they gave it to pacino for scent of a woman and then they 
[02:14:30]  kind of fucked him in hurricane and i feel like they owed him for training day so yeah but but  again i'm saying i'm glad they gave it to him training because that's actually like it's almost  like hurricane and x were kind of prestige movies and good scripts but training day was not the best  script that he then going okay i'm gonna drag this whole thing up on my on on my own skill level  basically and that's like okay that's great acting i have i have a more insidious look i i think that  they are very uh they're very weird with black actors and i know i know i'm normally not 
[02:15:00]  fucking i don't harp on that side of the racial thing but they don't know how to give black actors  or actresses unless for certain roles the only thing they give them for yeah that's true you know they  have to like play somebody who's either a maid or a fucking slave or a fucking drug dealer someone  who's corrupt and and damaged or they have to like give it to them for playing like the weird magical  sexless being that's there to help the white person out like oh i hope he helps this white  guy with his golf game oh god come on man do it who won who did denzel beat uh did he win did he 
[02:15:30]  beat uh uh uh is it russell crowe for a beautiful mine i don't remember who did he win who did he  beat i remember being really nauseous when he won it and i'm like that's an action movie that's like  scarface you know what i mean they should that was a that was a role that well let's find out who  did elevate who was up for it that year let's see uh training day so he beat will smith for ollie 
[02:16:00]  oh yeah beat russell crowe mine yeah beat sean penn for i am sam which um and then tom wilkinson for  in the bedroom and i am sam that that loss inspired that amazing speech in tropic thunder which is you  never go you never go you never go full full yeah yeah which which people got so angry at that but  there's like but this is actually accurate they're what they're saying is true and it's not making fun  of mentally handicapped people it's making fun of how they hand like i thought that was so brilliant  when i read that how how it's portrayed yeah yeah yeah well make sure you have a special power 
[02:16:30]  make sure you can count toothpicks really well yes uh brad wants to ask uh just something there  brad brad what do you got for pat brad hey guys good morning uh pat recently on huffington post i  think the website they posted a video yeah you're seeing from uh king of queens i believe it was  like a birthday scene and everybody's moving around but you still frozen didn't move an inch yeah 
[02:17:00]  yeah you can i was on the set that the king king of queens was such a fun show to do because all the  writers and producers were big stoners basically and they all were very pranky so they would always  slip things into the episodes to amuse ourselves so i was in the scene and the writers realized oh  he doesn't have any dialogue they go see if you can not move for this entire scene see if you can  stay perfectly still that's funny so you watch the scene and it's on huff poe and i showed it last  night on on fallon and and i literally there there's a birthday party they're exchanging presents and 
[02:17:30]  and i am in the background just not staring straight ahead and it's so creepy to the point where  then carrie lee remini goes into the kitchen and you can see over her shoulder back in the living  room i still have not you're still just standing there creepy here it is yeah oh there it is yeah  it's really you can this went viral last week man this thing yeah i was checking out thank you  brother yeah it's a long scene it is yeah there i am well i don't move the whole time still not moving 
[02:18:00]  you're standing behind kevin james yeah rolling in one speaker and the pins falling down in the  other yeah yep i think we found our new make-out album still not moving  that's so odd i know it's just  still not moving arms and the arms are like weirdly unnatural yeah it's like not it's not 
[02:18:30]  how now i've i've switched angles a tiny bit but i still haven't moved still haven't moved  holy shit yep how long is this clip oh no and then she walks in the room i still haven't moved now i  have a slight creepy smile trying to crack up then she goes in here to talk to someone and if you look in  a second over her shoulder i still haven't moved in the next if you look through the through the  pass through i still have not moved oh my god yeah it was i i don't know how i either got away with 
[02:19:00]  this or again this is this is all the writers and bruce like yeah we should do this because they're  they were all nuts oh and he's taking i want to see that funny fucking idea just to yeah yeah that is  very funny there's a lot of hidden stuff in in king of queens episodes little weird random phrases for no  reason not yet hang on you'll see it in just a second so he comes in  damn this is longer than i it's a big kitchen jesus i know but don't use them all because that's how i 
[02:19:30]  give him a slip of tour hey doug's shaking  all right that's it you're still there not moving still not moving that's how i act for real  did a lot of people catch on to that no it was you know i forgot that i did it and then somebody  just recently sent me the video went hey did you see this and then the next thing it was up on huff  poe that's funny man yeah damn cool that's great yeah so look for that apparently someone pointed out 
[02:20:00]  if you watched wkrp les nesman always has a band-aid on somewhere on his body visible  oh really and it constantly moves which is weird wow in one episode it'll move in every episode he's  in there is a there's always a band-aid that's always moving around so is he is he saying that  his character is a cutter or i don't know but it's there and and if you know to look for it once you  see it you can't not see it it moves in the episode or episode episode is different i sometimes it moves 
[02:20:30]  in the episode it's always in a different place yeah a little stuff like that so if you ever if  you're ever on a show do a little hidden stuff i'm gonna do that but i'm gonna do it like with  really badly like i'll wear a green sports coat and then a minilator lime a bright red just over  the top and like you're ruining the bitch or just always like always have a testicle hanging out  just one but only one never the whole sack only one yeah just the one  jesus i love it i do love stuff like that oh yeah uh patten was uh talking about 
[02:21:00]  airplanes because we were talking about alec baldwin well yeah alec baldwin got kicked off a  flight for playing words or something he's on a scrabbly game there that's uh words with friends  or sounds like it was a flight attendant just being a cunt although it was a male flight attendant i guess  kind of like a big cunt to it believe me well when you said that it was some guy i thought it was  another an older passenger that freaked out and wanted him kicked off because i've had times i 
[02:21:30]  remember when ipads or ipods first came out and we were taken off and they said take you know turn  everything off and i was powering it down and an old woman called the stewardess over it was like he  won't power his thing down and like like thinking we're gonna crash like i'm gonna kill everyone i'm  like no no it's okay i'm just gonna it's powering down and then she wanted the stewardess to take it away  from me you're not trusted with your toys and so i i just thought it was so mean to her or did you  like shut the fuck up i would just panicked i felt so bad for she was this terrified old woman 
[02:22:00]  who probably thinks that you know flying through the air is somehow akin to witchcraft i mean i don't  know but it's that it's that thing where she's you know like the way that your grandparents are  terrified of like the remote control or any new electronic thing it just it freaks them out so she  just wanted it gone yeah shut that off she'd rather be smoking in the airplane but also i i  just think that with the airlines folding the way they are and and and panicking and and they keep  reducing and this is going to sound really horrible but they they keep making it possible for anyone to 
[02:22:30]  fly on planes and i don't think anyone should be able to fly on a plane i think it should be a little  more because i've been on planes where i'm almost i've almost thought like if i were god i'd want this  plane to just crash because of the people that are on it i took a flight out of richmond indiana  to new york on this airline called ata airlines it's super cheap you're american trans air i think  they're called yeah it's all right so first they're boarding everyone we're at the gate and they go okay 
[02:23:00]  now we're going to board rose you know they're doing it from the back to the front so rose you know  17 to 30 everyone jams up into the door by the way this is before 9 11 so everyone jams in trying to  get on and then the the stewardess or the the gate is like we're just doing rows 17 to 30 if everyone  if you're not saying you just back off and this woman goes i'm not backing off from anywhere and  then a guy goes if she's not backing off i'm not backing off and then they had to call two security  people over to to weed through the crowd and get them to sit down then we get on the plane and we 
[02:23:30]  do that classic thing that the the pilot taxis out on the runway there's a long line but he just gets  us out there so we're in line then we stop we're just sitting on the runway because we got to wait  to take off and i'm sitting there and the stewardess is in her little jump out seat looking behind me  and i see her look back and say uh sir can you sit down can you sit down so then then everything calms  down then like a minute later she looks back up sir i need you to sit down and hear this guy why 
[02:24:00]  she goes well because we need you to be sitting down or we can't take off oh god oh the plane can't  can't fly if i'm standing i was like have you is this everyone's first flight today what is this  is this is this whole plane just a very special day i'd love to see him stand in the aisle while  the thing takes that would be awesome yeah and and we almost were going to go back to the gate because 
[02:24:30]  this guy this guy would i'm not sitting down we're just sitting here but you do understand the way why  as much as i hate flight attendants sometimes they deal with that all the time every day right  it's like no wonder they want to choke it's got to be something every day with those people i am  anytime i hear about a i'm sorry but anytime i hear about a policeman or a flight attendant or a  or a valet person snapping and going off i instantly take their side because they you know caught like  people in life like like violent assholes that you would want to avoid  cops have to go towards them and deal with them yeah all day and it's all just nuisance 
[02:25:00]  shit that's like i was talking to this policeman he goes the most accurate cop show ever on tv is  barney miller because all we do is it's not fucking miami vice and nypd blue it's just we're dealing  with hassle and annoyance some guy is just out and outside with his pants off i don't gotta wear my  pants all right let me go talk to this guy like that's all they do all day and same with like  that think of i just see the way people treat valet guys i'm amazed that there just aren't 
[02:25:30]  that there isn't an epidemic of just turds hidden under car seats everywhere by valet guys i would  totally support them doing that and same with flight attendants i see the way people act on planes  anytime a flight attendant snaps i'm like yes start hitting people start hitting them and they probably  get sick and tired of telling you and there's times i'm a pretty quiet good passenger where they  just are being twat but i guess it's because they've been dealing with these annoying oh yeah all day  yeah well it's like you ever like do a string of one-nighters and the last one-nighter in the string 
[02:26:00]  of one-nighters they're super mean to you because you realize oh they're used to comedians at the end  of an eight-day run and the comedians are in a shitty mood so they've just learned the minute that  comedian walks through the door just put them down get them quiet tell them to do like don't even deal with  it so you know it's it's that horrible they've been conditioned just to go would you shut up and  and be mean to you right yeah but again i'm always like you know what you go ahead and vent  because this will stop you murdering your spouse 10 years down the road from this tension that's 
[02:26:30]  built up yeah i think i could take it yeah yeah or if you uh like you take it out on the saturday  late show because somebody like from thursday even you know kind of cocksucker people in the audience  and by the saturday late show a guy calls and you're like get out help you get cancer  help your children are still born oh god you're right yeah the saturday late show is always it is  the it's the two worst things meeting it's people it's it's like remember you do those shows that  would start at like 11 30 on a saturday there's people that have already been out drinking and a 
[02:27:00]  community that's already done eight shows so it's the two worst storm fronts meeting in a club yeah it  was always a nightmare yeah friday late show can be a motherfucker too that can be a rough one  too because they're drunk they've worked all week late shows in general just aren't good yeah but  then i say that all the great late show on the saturday early show half of them would just be  comedy club people not my fans and they're like oh sounds like a great show to go to though i want  to go to late night shows now yeah that's it oh yeah i so i i used to love to do the when i would 
[02:27:30]  do carolines and then on sunday after the sunday show they would do like a late night just like  otto and george and all right yeah and and patrice and um and and they would just go up and  it started off as a structured show and then after a while they would just start it was just  them yelling at each other yeah yeah back and forth from the crowd so side stage boss it was just so  amazing shut up yeah from the side of the stage like the fuck am i watching here this is but it was 
[02:28:00]  so much better yeah i saw lisa lampanelli that way right she was she was part of those late night  shows too oh was she oh back in the day oh yeah that was a crazy time i remember me and florentine  watched voss on stage at carolines on a sunday and he'd be curtained off and me and jim were  standing on each side of the curtain and every joke voss told one of us would go oh man and start  groans we would love to start start and florentine came up with the idea of starting groans so it's the 
[02:28:30]  best when a guy's on stage and you're in the back going like oh and then people always like oh  starting groans is the fucking best thing in the world you guys are the biggest people  voss was so frustrated because you know it was us uh i saw i saw voss and patrice there one night  and they were both when voss was on stage patrice was going at him and it was again it was so much  better than they both without saying it were like this is so much better than material that i was 
[02:29:00]  going to do just yelling at each other and then patrice went up and immediately just laid in didn't  even let him do it said they just kept the argument going it was almost like let's let's just switch  places and keep arguing yeah so then at one point like voss starts yelling at like patrice is making  fun of voss's teeth and his veneers or whatever and voss starts making fun of patrice's weight like  you fat and then patrice goes i have a i have a gland problem and then fros goes i didn't know glands 
[02:29:30]  had the word hostess on them and then patrice did this thing where he did that classic like oh  shit that was such a great joke but i can't sit here and like i've got to nail him again so he's  trying not to laugh and trying to put voss down again unbelievable that's funny that's a funny line  yeah boom boom boom yeah just would not let up on each other people don't realize how great that is to  see you know you fuck the regular just stand up uh act that they were going to do i would love  seeing that oh yeah i mean it reminded me of like the old the apparently in the rat pack days it was 
[02:30:00]  just a free-for-all when it was oh yeah frank and sammy and dean i mean they would each go up and sing  songs but the other would would stay there and make fun and yell and go back and forth they could  drop out of a song to sling an insult go right back in without missing a beat like it i just heard  it was amazing when they were in their prime boom what's worse than the comic jumping in after like  a story like that with like a really bad story like yeah one time at the cellar and keith robinson  walks by i'm like what are you doing he's like yeah you'd love to know 
[02:30:30]  like a total non-story  it's like the riff killer oh yeah one time i was like hey you can have some of my fries he goes i'm  not gonna have any of those fries right and she said  he didn't want he okay because he didn't want them right but earlier i'd i offered him i didn't  know that he i'll be at uh be at caroline's only you gotta be there see me and this thing 
[02:31:00]  it is really great i love jumping in with a horrendous non-story after a story  it's the fucking best  so many ways just to fucking wreck everything  riff killer  yeah jimmy riff killer  jimmy raff killer 
[02:31:30]  that's funny  so this trump debate huh come on is this gonna be crazy or what no one's doing it though right  newt's doing it you know i guess who's in so far of course newt is first he's gonna say he would  he would he would go on he would go on wipeout if if it would get him a vote i i gotta say i i  actually i gained even more respect uh for ron paul and huntsman for going no 
[02:32:00]  fucking why are we doing that yeah ron paul beat up trump pretty good yeah them and and now  romney like them it's it's weird them this is almost like a willy wonka and the chocolate factor  situation them refusing to do the debate means they're eligible to be in the white house it's  almost remember when charlie gives back the gobstopper yes and then he goes oh that's the test you you  passed right i'm almost waiting for trump to then come out and go okay you three get to keep running  yeah you guys are out the rest of you guys why would you agree to this shit yeah you're out yeah 
[02:32:30]  you're idiots i was testing you you're not supposed to do you know who i am yeah i'm a  fucking idiot you're fired you're fired yeah can you imagine if trump was in willy walker he would  have said augustus you're fired we have the best chocolate factory it's mixed by waterfall  and i got a bunch of orange midgets and you look hey i'm good with the oranges the oranges love me  all right i have a good relationship with the oranges so i'm going to invite five kids and we're  going to tour the factory and uh you know maybe there'll be a surprise then tune in who knows 
[02:33:00]  and also andrew nice clay is going to be in there for some reason i'm very excited i'm very proud of  myself today hey jacoff it just comes out of nowhere sure call don't you hate trump's lips his lips  are raging constantly pursed his mouth looks like an infected bullet wound it looks like he didn't  have a mouth and and he just went to some cheap surgeon down at tijuana the guy's like well i 
[02:33:30]  just shoot you in the in the i shoot a mouth into your face and then it swells up around the edges  yeah oh god pat who's gonna be our next president who are you thinking look okay listen i i know  it's early what i'm about to say and i'm not saying this out of oh i don't like republicans  or i love democrats i have a lot of problems with especially the way the democratic leadership has  i've never seen people with carte blanche not get what they want and then someone like bush who in 
[02:34:00]  2004 squeaked in and then got everything he wanted so you know this is not a uh a question of leadership  or whatever um the republicans are having a shit year it happens it happens the democrats had one  in 68 they they fell apart they they were they went through a transition uh we we had the the republicans  had one in 76 when reagan challenged ford and it all fell apart the republicans are having a  shit year it happens it's okay go back regroup wait for 2016 you're going to need to run someone 
[02:34:30]  against hillary get somebody good obama's going to get re-elected and i'm not saying that out of a  oh you fuck you guys but just like here's by the way when people like o'reilly and and um oberman and  mad out all these people they it's their job to keep a narrative going it's like a it's like a cliffhanger  cereal there they'd be out of a job if they were like nate silver and like look i looked at the numbers  and he's he's gonna win sorry you know i mean they have to keep this narrative going but 
[02:35:00]  everyone knows they just know you can look at the film here and by the way i i will take  i'll take blame in 2004 i was so blinded by my hatred of bush that i could not see how awful  carry carries presidency his run for the presidency his campaign the whole democratic field that year  was a disaster you didn't like when he saluted and said reporting for duty oh my god are you that  is the that was the most awkward you have got to be it was i just i swear to god it was but again 
[02:35:30]  it was like and by the way i think that a lot of republicans are so blinded by their hatred of obama  that they're like i think uh i think gingrich might really take guys guys it's okay you're having a  a year it happens you know we we had one in 2004 we had one in 2000 we want to do that all gore had  to do was just get clinton just totally support clinton and get behind him and ask him to campaign 
[02:36:00]  for him and he wouldn't do it and he blew it did would gore not ask clinton nope he isn't what an  asshole nope why why yeah because in his mind i am going to try to distance myself from the scandal  even though even though at the height of the lewinsky scandal clinton's approval was still like  68 percent like it didn't affect anything no one cared so you know that i just you know again i'm not  i'm not down on the republicans there's a lot of ideas but there's even there's a lot of ideas within  the tea party that i actually support and here's another weird prediction i think in about five or six 
[02:36:30]  years elements the more sober elements from the tea party and occupy wall street are going to realize  they have a lot more in common than they have different and they're going to combine and that's  going to actually make real change because right now the tea party is holding the republican party  hostage and it's fucking them up the same way that the the the 60s radical movement fucked up the  democrats in 68 they just they couldn't get anything done because they would keep sabotaging 
[02:37:00]  themselves and so they're they're doing this insane purity test on these poor candidates they  don't understand that part of leading is having to compromise a little bit to get the other people  to do what you want them to do they're like no you have to be absolutely no this no this yes this  it's like no no they don't really have to do that and they just keep ankling themselves and  it's so weird to see that because they i mean there are some good ideas there it's going to  take four years to gel they're just going through a really weird birthing process right now 
[02:37:30]  do you agree with that and what pat is just the subtext is that pat is the jews  yeah yeah this is no but i mean do you agree that obama's going to get reelected at this point but i  hope not no i know you hope not but do you agree with that you think the republicans are in trouble  i can't tell at this point it's just one of those things i can i won't vote for him that's for sure i  don't and i don't care if if they run a fucking a cabbage head they could take a head of cabbage and run  it under the republican ticket i will vote for the head of cabbage okay right now you sound exactly 
[02:38:00]  like me in 2004 i literally was like i did a list of things i would vote for instead of bush  and it was literally like like a jar of broccoli farts uh i would vote for all italian food tasting  like it does at the olive garden for the next four years against bush uh i would vote for um uh  daily undeserved unlubed rape um and uh oh and i'd also i would vote for a puppy slowly freezing to 
[02:38:30]  death on christmas morning alone uh outside of a house uh i would vote for that over bush like that is  yeah yeah so you you are in the same boat that i like you are so pissed off for whatever reason  you're pissed off and i'm totally sure some of your reasons are legitimate some of them i don't  agree with just like i'm sure i bet a lot of them are legit i mean really but i mean it again you'll  i think four years from now you'll look back and go oh i was so pissed off and deranged that i  could not look soberly at the republican field the republican field right now is an absolute mess oh 
[02:39:00]  i don't but i don't care absolute yeah i don't even care yeah and by the way i i didn't care that  that the democratic field was an absolute mess in 2004 i just can't uh in good conscience uh vote for  this guy when you know i i i've i've made something of myself and i'm tired of being told i'm not doing  my fair share when i write giant checks uh to the internal revenue service uh every three months 
[02:39:30]  i i just and no one and the people that are telling me i don't do my share don't even know  what i'm paying that's just it too they don't know what i'm paying they just assume i i'm some big  wealthy guy that's got tax breaks and and a fucking accountant with a handlebar mustache that goes  yeah i know i'm paying through the fucking nose don't tell me i'm not doing enough anthony anthony  i don't think i don't think anyone thinks you're wealthy or successful so don't even worry about  they certainly don't think you have a glass 
[02:40:00]  they do not think that you are wearing a monocle and uh  sipping chamomile tea you're long island garbage  did you watch downton abbey last night it was an absolute  panic that butler is are you for occupy wall street uh yeah you know i and i'm i'm for  occupy wall street especially for how this is how any movement starts it is a disorganized 
[02:40:30]  mess and it's all emotional and then i was actually glad in a very weird way that it got  shut down in a lot of cities because what's going to happen is it's the same thing as when anything  gets shut down now the actual sober organizing people at the core of this i have to go okay  now what is a way to actually make some impact we we had our huge temper tantrum and i think it was  really necessary they were they weren't asking for anything too crazy they were just like how about when 
[02:41:00]  somebody becomes rich and successful they don't slam the door behind them and bolt it so no one else  gets in right you know i mean that was basically the most that was it that was it in its most inarticulate  forum but what i'm saying now is good it's been it's been shut down it's been chased out of  its areas now they're going to have to find you know an even better way to organize and it's going  to have end up having even more impact the same way the tea party the tea party had the exact same  criticisms they don't know what they want it doesn't it's all over the place it's nine different 
[02:41:30]  things and they finally started winnowing it down and that's how you know it's that's a good  point i wonder if the organizers uh were happy that it all went away because i went down to the one  at zuccotti park a lot yeah and the freaks i'm like you know no one's gonna take you people  seriously you guys got to get rid of the freaks to even start somebody wrote on reddit i wish i could  credit whoever wrote this it was so brilliant i was yes i mean i was a first-hand account of gay  marriage no no this yeah no i went down there yeah i went down this isn't no this isn't the 50 best uh 
[02:42:00]  anal porn i'm sorry i went down there just to film silly videos and people like oh you're you're  you know you're just trying to find the freaks i'm like no they're right in front of my eyes and they  see the camera and run at you like they all run at you what i'm saying is it's the easiest thing to  film somebody wrote this thing and it said hey occupy wall street blue oxford button-up shirts and  chinos and loafers dress like professional that is what is going to freak those in power out if 
[02:42:30]  you're out there banging a tambourine and and topless with glitter paint on they're going to go  yeah of course it's just but if you're out there i mean one of the reasons that um they that there was  such a huge it was called the brooks brothers riot during the 2000 election the the republicans who  rioted and wanted a recount showed up dressed and and that is what freaks people up like holy  shit these people mean business these are people who actually do work and have jobs and they're 
[02:43:00]  taking time off from their work to make sure this gets done okay they'll listen to you but if you're  out there with all your piercings and your tribal tattoos like well the guy wasn't going to be doing  anything even if you do have a legitimate job the first thing that people in power look at is like  that guy doesn't matter yeah and and and also that guy is like proud to be i'm off the grid man well  then i don't need to listen to you yeah but if you're out there if you are out there in a brooks  brothers suit and clean shaven and and and not screaming and yelling and chanting just going 
[02:43:30]  we want this this and this and if they see 10 000 of you they're like okay we might want to listen  to these guys because these are our clients and this is who we need to buy our shit that's what  that's what scares people it's the people that are going to buy the the mortgages and the flat screen  tvs if they start protesting you know soccer moms start showing up they're like okay what do you  guys want right which is probably why the tea party was taking a little more seriously because  they they were older and they seem like more responsible citizens exactly yeah and by the way 
[02:44:00]  i don't remember as many freaks with the people they seem like more responsible but this should this  should be a huge lesson uh occupy wall street is getting tear gassed and clubbed um and and they're  and all they're doing is banging tambourines and the tea party are showing up with guns and signs  like we need to water the tree of liberty and the cops are like well but they got a nice the hair looks  okay they're you know they're not you know they're not wearing a rage against the machine shirt with a 
[02:44:30]  with a belly tattoo i mean you know i'm just i'm not i'm i'm oversimplifying this but the you know occupy  wall street dress like the oppressor you know dress walk forth in the armor of your enemy and and  you'll get so much more done and i bet you at one point i hate to wax poetic but a bunch of people  dumped tea in a harbor and i'll bet they look pretty crazy back to you well those guys dressed as indians  they were yeah they were they were literally like they were like they put on indian clothes and had 
[02:45:00]  little costumes on and and i'm i'm look i'm sure there were a lot of loyalists looking around going  with these idiots with the jimmy's playing riff killer today yeah i love the new character riff  killer riff killer this is the worst of the obi anthony show serious xm downstairs they know me  i've come in enough i still have to go to the security so wait we've been here for two straight  years let us just walk through at this point well i don't i still pull out my wallet but the girl has 
[02:45:30]  my my badge ready she knows my name at this right right i still pull my wallet out and my id  because i don't ever want to get caught out there comfortable enough to where she go  oh like where she the okey doke where it's like oh you comfortable now yeah id please you know like  it's like okay i know what you're doing you're setting me up to be comfortable i'm not gonna play it  every day i pull it out and she gets frustrated almost that you see i'm fucking no not asking you 
[02:46:00]  you're right you should do that but i i don't want you to look at me ever and go and catch me and then  you you you trick me into thinking oh it's all comfortable yeah it's not it's not on it's not  but there has to be a mentality to hiring because a lot of those girls i go how do you  how do you how do you how do you keep this how does a 400 pound woman have a job protecting  the security of the nation that i i will never understand whose feet hurt yeah who's breathing 
[02:46:30]  funny who's not gonna tits are down to the floor can't walk the arms are out she's not gonna run after  anyone she's not gonna run after no how is a 400 pound woman but it's cause they something about big  those girls yeah not saying they're all like that but some about the ones who are like that  they're so they're almost like having the counterpart of having like an indian work for you 
[02:47:00]  where if i had a store and i i would have to have a hindu person work because they won't give you a  break they'll die for oh if you try to steal some holes they'll fucking get shot over that they'll take  take a few bullets take a few bullets they won't let you even slide for a penny  and and it's and it's i think i think big gun girls they just have this thing where they'll  fucking make you you know i like where you're going all right so uh a guy comes into a um 7-eleven 
[02:47:30]  to rob it right go through the scenarios white guy behind the counter what does he do  well you can you see cctv no i know but let's go a white guy let's go through this quickly in a  place right yeah he puts his hands up right and steps back he presses the button that proper button  the fucking thing yeah and if he has the security or he has the the the safe code he he gives it to  oh yeah he's not dying hands up over your bullshit let's go through this quick so now you got a 
[02:48:00]  a female white employee what does she do she i've seen cctv where female white they panic a little  bit they get a little nervous yeah but some might take a swing yeah that's weird and they a lot of  times they get knocked out but that i'll tell you what that is it's the same thing that'll get a white  woman's baby kill in the street it's an entitlement thing sometimes white women got to get knocked in  the head and they don't think to make them understand that life they've never been hit by a guy right and 
[02:48:30]  can't imagine that this guy even though he's robbing the place would hit her so she goes for  his arm when he's going into the register and this motherfucker will turn around and cold cock her  square in the face she's now out of the picture she's out of the fucking close circuit tv picture  and the guy just picks the money up but that's that's from entitlement yeah yeah and you got to  think the robbers know this this is like profile on their yeah their part they know who's behind  the counter how about uh black guy black guy is back it matter of fact if the black guy can get 
[02:49:00]  depend on where he works though because yeah there's a lot of bulletproof glass uh-huh uh where  black guys work but if they're gonna rob a liquor store and there's no bulletproof glass black guy will  either do two things he will bounce out of the exit because we think about getting murdered just get  the fuck out of there we don't think about okay we don't think about just take the money and leave  we think about my life is gonna kill me so he's like yo yo all right and he's out he's not and he 
[02:49:30]  sprints for the door he's trying to leave or he he might back up and and uh and uh and just put his  hands up you know say look take your shit don't kill me you know who the worst are we're heading that  way hey i gotta say asians well we're heading that way okay yeah i'm on this uh black uh woman black  woman does the same thing except for she'll be talking and making sure that this guy don't

[02:55:30]  fucked up thing too is those those rotund black women do get a lot of positions of of power like  that that uh the ticket agents out on the street uh tsa um uh uh dmv like all these places where you  need these people to help you that's where you encounter a lot of these women and that's where you  get most of the problems because i don't i did have people who hire people are not dumb yeah i was 
[02:56:00]  driving yesterday and saw i i don't want to get in trouble but listen uh i saw two lady police officers  team in a in a cruiser yeah two girls well they wasn't out just trying just no driving through the  cities keep it safe and i just my immediate my immediate thing is to laugh and almost to do 
[02:56:30]  something so they stop me and just and go really and just get go through the arrest thing just to say  could you arrest me like what are you doing this is and just sit in the back i just started daydream  all sitting in the back just going really like like i think they hire people who would get no respect  otherwise like like why not hire every cop to be like kenny like meaning somebody who could arrest 
[02:57:00]  you if they wasn't a cop oh yeah yeah yeah so i'm like i think they put in people who are very and  guys too not just ladies there are some guys who are cops you just start you're just gonna go  yeah and you go really you know the only reason that we're talking right now is because i respect  the actual law like actually i can fucking i can fucking be arrested by a computer because i respect  the law uh-huh i wouldn't want the law coming down on me right but but but you but you're gonna do this 
[02:57:30]  you're just a mess and you want to laugh at him yeah but you go i respect the law you know i'll take it  kenny's got a uh a little print here well some departments don't have physical fitness standards  oh you could tell yeah you could you know like back in the day like you know we we had to take  you know a physical test where you had to get over a six-foot wall and why they stopped doing that  well because you have to have a very cultural diverse but what does that have to do with being 
[02:58:00]  fat hey we gotta put fat bitches on the floor fat bitches had to be on the forest with their pants  pulled all the way up under their titties i love that look yeah walking around the ass in the front  uh that's the front the front ass you fucking messy bitch i think it's disrespectful kitty because it's  like okay i see you in the street disrespects the uniform because you get respect even when you're not 
[02:58:30]  in uniform see that's what i'm saying they still need police that that can that have understands  getting respect from other people and giving respect yeah yeah how to how to exchange but when you get  some little broad and she's standing in and and she's just wearing too much heavy clothing you see  the belt is too heavy and the gun is too heavy her head is big she's gonna fucking be an asshole  because she's already coming in with that defensive disadvantage that thing she's got to make up for 
[02:59:00]  it well you know she you know you know she don't respect so all but really all she needs to go is  go look um basically i'm the law did you ever see that that cc clip of the police the the black guy  saying baby get in the car telling his daughter baby get in the car oh shit and the fucking woman cop is  like i'm a woman cop and the guy punches her once punches her in the face shatters her entire girl  face yes and it's like come at people knowing we know who you are yeah yeah but what you are is 
[02:59:30]  you're not able to deal with some fucking uh frantic big black some people are not going to just respect  the uniform and the law it doesn't they will punch your girl face in so you get you get these these  these really bad uh security guards these really bad uh uh meter maids they i think they hire people  who never had respect before because they won't let you slide they won't they they're so happy hovering 
[03:00:00]  over you and controlling you yeah that if i if i was a cop a lot of motherfuckers would be getting away  with shit yeah like i would stop a dude and somebody and they go some girl's like i think  just like i think everybody who commits a crime shouldn't go to jail right because jail is there  for to to to penance so you go to jail and you go you know i i didn't i really didn't mean to hit 
[03:00:30]  you with the car and it's like you know what i think you will never do it again i'm not sending you  to fucking jail you don't need to be in jail just because of the statute i'm sitting i'll send you  to jail if i think you should be off the streets but there's some people that commit crimes that  shouldn't be off the fucking streets they'll never do anything again never so if i was a cop because  i've been big my whole life so i understand certain kind of respect you pull over somebody that's 
[03:01:00]  horrified their fucking light is out they're fucking you know they got tents or whatever everybody got  tents out when i look down what are you doing they answer a couple of good questions i'm like go  ahead your license is suspended get it unsuspended just fucking like i wouldn't i wouldn't fucking be  lawly with every body why but those the whack motherfuckers that's because okay you get you get some  little girl that goes in the police force bunch of bunch of 30 and 40 old dudes sitting there like 
[03:01:30]  hey dudes all right got your cuffs she's gonna try to overly prove that she belongs on the i don't  trust any woman that wants to be a cop why the fuck do you want to be a cop why the  fuck do you want to fight in a war bitch they got everybody confused yeah stay home  i don't i don't get the whole female cop thing whenever i watch some of these shows and see  one female cop up against one big fucking perp and and she isn't just immediately holding him at 
[03:02:00]  gunpoint with her fucking radio going please back up send some men out here because i there's no way  i'm taking this one he's laughing at that female bounty hunters kenny's laughing kenny you got anything on  that he can't say nothing but kenny no oh he could say a thing like he's saying things but he's heard  stories of of the past well he watches a lot of police movies yeah and police shows yeah yeah 
[03:02:30]  and there's a lot of old school guys like i saw in a movie yeah yeah that are of of the opinion you  know they should like stay home and be barefoot and pregnant right right or at least barefoot yeah  but you know in today's modern day policing society uh-huh there is very limited  you know use for women resources right and policing and policing because it's a police state of mind 
[03:03:00]  it's like you can hire any you don't need to hire the elite because it's a police state it's a police  it's a mental control right so all you have to do is have somebody in a uniform but but see my thing i  learned early in life like there's a certain way to talk to police um police hate when you think you  know the law because there's a thing that police have that cancels everything people don't know  that when i grew up used to be like a lot of motherfuckers read books and went to jail read  books and be like keith robinson i have the i know that shit motherfucker i if i the law states if i'm 
[03:03:30]  standing 10 feet away from you i am allowed it's like police have a thing called uh uh uh disorderly  disorderly disorderly me is purely what i say goes right it that it ends all your shit you are being  disorderly i can arrest it oh you're gonna get out and you're not gonna pay a fine the charges will be 
[03:04:00]  drop but you will go through the hassle yes of me coughing you it's a police uh uh it's a police  cancel all disorderly is like this funny word that we kind of think like your disorderly kind of  thinks you you're raising hell no no it's your distress be anything if a cop says this and you  don't do it disorder that's disorder that's tumultuous behavior  they they have a loophole because a guy cops this it just really you want to challenge cops 
[03:04:30]  sometimes sometimes you got to be willing maybe okay there's a battle i'm a fight i was at newark  during christmas time picking my moms up during christmas time and it gets busy they put a cop  out there yeah you know wave you know and i go you know sir i'm trying to pick my mom up this way  and i just go cool but i'm like did you realize like you're not because i said so yeah it's not a  or like it's not good enough you gotta you gotta be more respectful of the of the entire idea of 
[03:05:00]  people when you just go because i said so yeah that means that you're the law like judge dread and not  that you're following the law you are the law but you're not the law but i don't like to get into those  crazy things like they're gonna beat my head in but i'm just going come on man be more  respectful can't you also get them on an obstruction like if they're just you see that smirk i know  if someone's like videotaping something that brought back a nice memory for kenny 
[03:05:30]  or they're yelling shit out but you know you don't want to get them on a disorderly  or maybe can't can you get an obstruction that's another sham arrest it is you know whenever you see  like disorderly conduct obstructing and resisting arrest yeah you know that guy's just paying a  stupid tax hey it is what it is it's just like you can't get past it but that's just so wrong man 
[03:06:00]  i got nypd checking in on twitter i'm a nypd and a couple of years ago nypd hired two female midgets  true story i swear to god if i saw a female midget cop first of all i'd laugh my balls off just  thinking it was a gag and then if if i was a guy that might be apt to commit crimes i would not let  that person arrest me not even right it's been my experience on the street like if a few cops show up 
[03:06:30]  on a call there there's some kind of incident and i was usually the biggest guy there yeah the  shit them would always come at me and give me a hard time figuring if he can back down the biggest  guy the other everybody else is gonna fall in line oh shit you know so you were the marked man yeah so  so but see kenny knew how it be on a natural level as a big man yeah kenny already knows how to diffuse  yes problems and something tells me kenny wasn't the guy that would get out and go 
[03:07:00]  excuse me sir if there was a a volatile situation you would use body language and your voice and  everything to to make sure that person knows you're in fucking charge no if i pulled up to a volatile  situation the first thing i would do is turn on the sirens and give them a chance to run  fuck it you didn't want to do too much yeah i've i've heard a lot of stories from kenny over the  years and kenny without giving too much away he's been in situations where you know the guy would 
[03:07:30]  life or death just as big as kenny if not bigger and kenny sort of had a problem trying to you know  control the situation and look how big he is he's six five oh there's some big bad guys so how is a  female midget in this yeah yeah in this case gonna handle these situations you're just gonna  put another cop in danger she's doubly useless well that one where the guy punched that woman in the  face she fell down uh and you couldn't see the dash cam anymore because she was in front of the car 
[03:08:00]  he got over her and kept beating you fc this bitch man just beat the fuck out of her face  then to prove her her fucking gun hope she's working again yeah yeah steel blades in her face  she got fucking nuts and balls reconstructed eye sockets oh yeah it's like miss just now be a mom  did the guy take her gun too no no no but he's in jail for the rest of his life that guy oh yes he 
[03:08:30]  gets his daughter oh no oh he clocks her her daughter goes daddy daddy it's a sad video  get in the car and he goes oh go baby right in the car and he just proceeds to beat the  shit this is yeah yeah this is it she got her face smashed in every bone broken reconstructive  surgery the blasted her man out of her face and the and that's his daughter yeah oh get in the car  baby get in the car baby he go ahead gal go ahead now he and he got that you look what you made me 
[03:09:00]  do you do lady yeah yeah he's like oh man how make me beat your fucking face he went to jail  forever oh man and the daughter's just like great to not be a complete misogynist  would that happen you think that would happen to you that situation like the the the brutality of it  i mean you know it's it's hard to second guess you know when you're out there on the highway all by  yourself you know that's a bad situation but if it was a male as opposed to a female cop the 
[03:09:30]  shitter might have thought twice yeah and i'm gonna tell you why okay not to say that she's not a good  cop i'm saying that as a as a dude yeah you there's nothing to see she's coming up as a cop yeah as a man  cop you're coming up as a dude now showing this big motherfucker you're you're already thinking  she's right in his face she's got her cuffs out he turns around oh look at look look she got caught 
[03:10:00]  so fucking she never thought he was gonna do that she thought everything about her was was  the second he turned around and he didn't turn around with a punch he turned around first looked at  her at that point she should have gotten a lot more defensive and backed off she stood there  holding her cuffs like a dummy thinking that's gonna fucking do something and he that big meaty  fist right into her face you're a dude and i'm not saying that couldn't happen but most of the time 
[03:10:30]  if you're a fucking dude and a big dude and you see that motherfucker you you're telling them  everything you need to do from way from where you are look it's like standing in front of the car  because you're thinking like a like if you was just two people put your hands on the car this is  for uh both of our protection like motherfucker stay right there got any weapons on you but she  was she was being mislawed like yeah yeah you think she was also thinking that he would never hit a 
[03:11:00]  woman no it was like he would never yes he would never hit a woman she had never hit a cop and the  kid being there threw her off guard too she probably thought what's he gonna do his daughter's right  her body language was saying this there's no way this 60 fucking her body language was saying  there's no way this guy's gonna hit me no she didn't even think think she let him over and at  any time that guy could have turned around and punched her and he did of course but that's what  i'm saying you you need elite physical specimens yeah like when i see that big stormtrooper pull you 
[03:11:30]  over in this fucking tight shirt and his tight walk in his boots you go you go you know you're like oh you know what sir  and i knew would in a nine times out of ten if you got a decent excuse and you're not breaking a law  and you're you're complying anytime i didn't get a ticket from a state a statey it was a big dude  who was like and he probably met his his first of the month ticket quota right and and he's just like 
[03:12:00]  go ahead anytime you get one it's an old nonsense guy some old dude that's just like man what an  asshole yeah and then or some woman it's like why is she doing this but but this big stateys when  you think of a big statey yeah you just think of a motherfucker that can tip your car over  by himself that hat over that crew cut a by himself guy you need that you can't have like this this  little old lady or this middle-aged woman thinking it's all about fucking that's what i'm saying when 
[03:12:30]  i drive through the holland tunnel i'm looking at this i'm calling this little girl she ain't doing  and i just want to pull over and talk to her yeah and not get arrested just what you ever good job at  macy's not only are you a girl you're really a girl yeah you're a super girl like what are you  gonna do if i don't give a fuck hey yeah i don't want to punch your face in like that what are you  gonna do if i don't give a fuck like that's just so you that's so weird to me and it's and it's 
[03:13:00]  so disrespectful to put a people a person not in his position but he got 60 years for and you saw  when he stood over he's looking like oh boy he already looked at what the fuck did he look like  oh boy i had oh man i'm done i'm done and his daughter's fucked up now now she's a woman's rights  activist oh you know fucking because she's seen daddy do that shit beat the fuck out so she's ever with  a man that tickles and she's gonna stab him and mace him she's all fucked up now 
[03:13:30]  she's all fucked up but i mean i might i'm not i'm not out of bounds kenny i don't think i think a  lot of people think your way kenny anything to answer this it's an unfortunate situation it is  unfortunate i mean the midget thing is taking a little too far on the police force wait whoa little  little person somebody texted me that little thing oh wait a minute the midget cop ended up getting  fired because she was a lesbian and called other people lesbians on a domestic call  wait that's a real that's a real yeah well hey you lesbian like i need this shit i'm a cop freeze 
[03:14:00]  motherfucker we need little juicy ass cops little little fucking round butts those giant asses and  short little legs little arms when you just pick up the midget and run away with her  oh man if you're in a situation you'd grab her and run away her little side half boot they gotta  get a special made police boot throw in a garbage pail and you keep running they gotta get a modified  baby shoe to be a a fucking a little stormtrooper boots painted black so the midget the midget 
[03:14:30]  lesbian cop went on a domestic call with some other lesbians and the midget lesbian cop started  calling the other one and asking for a date and that's why she got fired oh shit and you know  that they were so good they were like thank god yeah we got we finally finally got away what a  fucking mockery we figured out a way to get out of this i think the a big fat ass asshole jamaican  bitch fucking um uh a car person is a fuck is a it's a it's an embarrassment yeah yeah because they're 
[03:15:00]  there for some kind of weird there is a reason and they and they're so cold you're not supposed  to be they don't look at you when you talk to them they're just like oh miss i just went in the  store for a second move your car yeah move it i'm gonna get up i already started you're like  fuck you man and you know what i i was hoping no one was gonna bring this up but uh we did have female 
[03:15:30]  cops come in when we were working at anyw i want to stay for the record i was out of shape that day  no let me also tell you something else we wanted to see how fast they could cut i think that video's  online and they cuff us very quickly but all we were able to do was resist physically trying to  oh that's good do this if if i was allowed to punch her in the fucking face  as hard as i could they cut that could have been a problem so what does she do  might have choked the shit out of me i don't know average resistance uh they were very good at 
[03:16:00]  tying me up and cuffing me so what did you try to do like did you i tried to yeah i tried to worm  my way around i tried to hold her arm back we were trying to i tried to keep my arm she got a  fucking you know uh uh arm in there bent it bent my arm back and it was two on one if you remember  she was well trained the whole girls on the whole gig was could we get out of the studio so it was like  and go oh wow yeah so we had to get out of the studio and uh you know we fought like like hell  but steve carlisi didn't get out no and it was just me and ann i think it was just you and i think 
[03:16:30]  and rick oh yeah and you know what basic look look i know it's not like they're hiring  fucking martha stewart but that's me and that's opie and that's rick it's not some big motherfucker  who is out for blood that would punch your face even little guys if guys don't want to get locked  up man they they can do anything sometimes it's hard to get people and then once the adrenaline's  going and maybe they're a little sweaty you can't grab them all i'm saying is i was impressed that 
[03:17:00]  day i i didn't even think they were going to be able to cuff us that's how well they had  laughable we thought they were a lot of it you know like they say look i saw a lockup on uh  uh oh man what channel discovery yeah i love that show yeah well i've seen one it was into no  it was msnbc yeah it was international lockup oh shit and uh the jail in fucking chechnya 
[03:17:30]  it was a state-of-the-art jail it was a state-of-the-art jail but the guards didn't have  uh sticks they didn't have tasers they didn't have cuffs and the and the prisoners weren't cuffed  as they were taking them back and forth because the guards they all ufc fighters yeah not literally  but they were elite yeah motherfuckers man that are breaking your face and they knew there was not 
[03:18:00]  going to be a lawsuit if he elbowed the guy's face in dude and you could you could just the the the  serenity yeah and the non-violence because of the fact that you you you didn't want to deal with  these guys weren't fucking around they would they would kill you and it wouldn't matter it'd be two  of them when when when someone's being escorted through the hallways it was always two of them and  they were all young just jacked bad motherfucking those eastern european yeah ex-soccer hooligans 
[03:18:30]  that were trained to you know to fight to fight and they and they you allow one person out in the  hall at a time and then when you're in the yard they everybody gets to and all the cops are there  making sure everybody's playing right but there's no fucking they don't have the weapons they don't  have it's just their little uniforms their little mcdonald's uniforms and they just are escorting  other big dudes down home but they know they know what's gonna happen to them if they 
[03:19:00]  fuck around when i see a storm trooper coming at me on 95 you're at your best behavior on a lot of  levels gotta be now i respect the law so if i saw a fucking woman midget i'm not gonna laugh in the  face you're still gonna be but i'm gonna go yes yeah yeah yeah but i'm just gonna go away if i didn't  respect the law i just kick this i'll kick you i'll bowl you right now i'd open the door and just  knock it right in the face with the door handle just just to get the legend of the laugh i would 
[03:19:30]  get i'll take the 10 years but but you but but i respect the law i don't want the law down on me  because i know it's a it's a it's huge it can't be stopped but at the end of the day you know you  you go oh man let's look at this fucking guy's giant head and his fucking seriousness and you go you  go dude what was i doing 60 and then the one guy let me go because i said this he goes  he was speeding i go sir i was in the middle of the pack i know i was speeding but i was gone 
[03:20:00]  with everybody else how'd you pick me out of here and it's just like well you know and i go oh come  on i was a little charming the dude was like yeah come on i just what is it because my truck is giant  and random what he just he laughed he he laughed as much as a state trooper could laugh yeah yeah but  he was like i just uh you know and it's like i said this you know i can't imagine if i was trying  to do that to a woman and she's like oh you're trying to charm me yeah no you're not what you 
[03:20:30]  think you're because i'm a girl you can just tickle your way out of a ticket stay here stay here in  the vehicle yeah i'll be i'll be back yeah it's just it's because she's not used to get it i i it was a  girl in uh florida they they brought the cops into to to escort this old drunk lady she was belligerent  they came to get her out and i go jesus christ look at this cop she's delicious and she looked  at me with cop face i go kid give me a fucking break miss you're blonde and sexy you look like  the the swiss miss coco girl i'm fucking i'm gonna jerk off to you in the prison when when you arrest me 
[03:21:00]  like you know just fucking with her laughing but she but it's always got to be you are going to  respect me but a big dude somebody fucks with kenny in the audience he's gonna laugh  because he's it's it's not digging to the to the you know he's gonna have control of the situation  without a doubt in your mind control the whole fucking situation and i'm not trashing women  cops i'm just like i guess i am but it's like but there's a problem there there's an inherent 
[03:21:30]  problem man you got just like skinnier guys cops and everything they it's gonna be a problem you got  cops calling and they're all like thank you patrice because they can't they can't say this stuff  they're all in agreement i don't have one and it's it's just i don't have one it's just based on  being a person who knows how to handle yourself without the permission of the the justice system  right right we got there's a good story coming in from boston anthony go ahead buddy well i'm sitting 
[03:22:00]  with you oh um so basically uh my cousin is a big state trooper he's about six three he works down  on the beach a lot where there's a lot of bars and uh he's got this new partner i guess they change the  rules you don't have to be six feet anymore he's about five two we call them frodo and uh this guy  used to work down uh on the beach you know like i said and i guess he was working at night and these  drunk kids just have no respect one time just started rubbing his head tell him how cute he was because 
[03:22:30]  he was so small and dressed up in his little uniform oh that's just not right  you gotta have physical physically elite people to fucking control your life i knew one of these  would come in we got a retired cop so he has nothing to lose keith in missouri go ahead sir  you're right i ain't got nothing to lose  the there are exceptions that i've worked with some good women but the majority of female police 
[03:23:00]  officers have got some type of massive inferiority complex and they're either like ultra ultra aggressive  or they think they can fix the world fight love  i love let me what what take other than physically being physical uh a presence what does it really  take to be a really a really great cop what common sense that's the bottom line doesn't matter how 
[03:23:30]  many book smarts and knowledge book knowledge you have you need common sense right right right  all right anything else missouri uh keith there well i want to say i love kenny because every time the  man talks it's something that i want to say yeah kenny uh went through the war we we had an old saying  we had an old saying when we were going to go to a fight take your time you take the winner to jail 
[03:24:00]  and the loser to the hospital that's right sir  that's right which is basically is the truth yeah if you got eyes it's like you  fucking know how that's gonna happen  cops ain't shit okay this is so fun cops are just dudes  they really are what are you gonna do they really are uh bob in ohio bob 
[03:24:30]  listen listen i was on the force with a female officer and she was not only black but i'm six  foot three 245 pounds and she had an attitude three times my size and she was just a con and a  half and there's no nice way to say it i couldn't wait till the day she got fired she actually got  fired for assault charges of course of course assault pull over motherfucker when i say pull 
[03:25:00]  up you pull over oh can you give me a little bit of insight on this kenny these new unmarked police  cars that are pulling you over that have lights that can you can get at your local um your local  unregistered puerto rican uh alarm shop they'll put them on yes can i drive somewhere to where i  think it's very safe in case this guy's a a a a criminal with with those lights on like if it's 
[03:25:30]  a real cop wait what are they using it doesn't look like a cop car dude they're in escalades they're in  fucking camaro yeah i've seen that regular cars and they have the flashing lights but you can put  those on yourself and they flash you but i'm saying that it's not even like the police thing where they  pull it out the top and put the cone on the top yeah yeah it's the whole thing you know the life  package so i'm wondering if you can if even if he's a cop where they go look man i i drove another extra 
[03:26:00]  five miles just because i thought you might have been trying to rob me and you know i mean is that  legal to do well that could be your affirmative defense in court fair enough for running yeah  because you know it there are a lot of undercover cars with these fancy fucking lights now but and  you know especially uh women are scared you know because women get pulled over and sexually assaulted  i would at least if if it's at all possible uh and i've done this before just just for the safety 
[03:26:30]  factor of me and the cop because i've been pulled over on the expressway where there's no shoulder or  anything uh and i've put my hazards on put my hand out the window giving a wave like i acknowledge  that you're pulling me over but i'll slowly find a good spot to uh to stop and sometimes that's  getting off the highway and pulling into a parking lot under a fucking light at night i'll make sure  like make them totally comfortable you know put both hands on the wheel uh window down and and 
[03:27:00]  dome light on uh but but i let them know i'm not you know i see you right i just want to make sure  we're both in a safe place right and i think they understand that if you're fucking if you just  you take off from them uh there's gonna be a problem it's not fucking uh uh uh you know the dodge  intrepid's and it's it's it's yeah yeah they got bentley's now or something like i think you know 
[03:27:30]  the drug dealer cars they just make it into police cars yeah yeah if if you're in an isolated area and  you think you're gonna get jacked i think you could pull to a more populated place and well there's  always like some gas station or just something somewhere in front of a security camera it's just  anything you know i'm just checking anything i'm pulling over for this fucking guy in a cab yeah i don't  know and yeah and kind of look at him as he's walking up to you see what it's fucking got in his  hand what are you doing i'm going home yeah so am i really yeah it's 10 o'clock goodbye what is going 
[03:28:00]  on this is the worst of the open anthony show serious xm look oh i know i look as as people that find  some stuff funny that we what am i trying to say i just putting the kid in the tree makes  me laugh really hard and i know we're not supposed to laugh at that i know it's so twisted obviously  but the video of of him in the tree i know because he's being beat up it's horrible there's a case of 
[03:28:30]  bullying that was going on and obviously there's a bullying epidemic going on out there but the video  i know they're just stuffing him in a tree because that shit happened to all of us yeah but it wasn't  bullying back then no it was called you know you you should have ran and obviously run faster home  i gotta be careful obviously what these kids did is it's horribly it's horrible and it's wrong but 
[03:29:00]  they're trying to they're trying to shove them in the tree they also try to shove them into something  else too like on top of a fence and then like hang them up on a fence and in the end the kid wasn't  really hurt no still horrible i you know obviously the tape i tape the fucking uh video i saw they  didn't uh they weren't like kicking him it wasn't like they had him down on the ground and they were  dragging him around by his feet on the ground but they he was down there and i thought they were  going to start kicking him in the head and shit and i didn't see any of that so they lifted him up 
[03:29:30]  and try to they fucked with him they fucked with him bad put him in a tree yeah why are they blurring  everybody out man these guys are utes yeah but they were brave enough to do it and  fucking film it for their friends so let's uh let's see your faces upper darby that's where the tower  theater is upper darby is yeah i know upper darby and look now that they're dragging him by his feet  yeah but this part and then they pick him up and now they're trying to hang him on a fence  this is actually news though some some kids put another kid in a tree it's like yeah because look 
[03:30:00]  look look this guy's angry we will not have this happen it will never make your fellow students  and make the streets unsafe it's on it's unconscionable we're not going to tolerate  it and they're going out in handcuffs authorities say they have arrested seven teenagers in connection  with the assault white and black were arrested together they got together for some working  together for bullying it's about time we get together for something yeah that was uh nice to see does  it does the the kid being stuffed in the tree make you laugh even though you're not supposed 
[03:30:30]  to laugh at that it's just it's hysterical it is right yeah because you know you've seen that  before oh my god i saw that kids being bullied you see that they shoved me in a locker in high  school all sorts of yeah yeah stop turn that it was part of growing up wasn't it yeah being bullied  then again part of growing up is when those kids show back up with a fucking trench coat right and  they fucking extract a pound of uh vengeance sure but is it is it worse now than it was when 
[03:31:00]  before teachers did anything and before the police did anything right yes and i'll tell you why because  ellen the generous is talking about it oh she makes it way worse oh she bullying because back back then  it was just you no one went to the fucking principal when you got your ass handed to you outside the  school or you were bullied or some shit like everyone knew who the bully was you just didn't  fuck with him and you walked past on eggshells hoping nothing was gonna you know happen where  he decided you were the one you were the fucking wounded gazelle by the watering hole that was what 
[03:31:30]  the bully did who the fuck went to the principal that that's not going that's like going to the  warden yeah yeah you didn't do that you just didn't do that you didn't do it that would make it way  worse now the police get involved in shit although we never had the uh opportunity to put the fun stuff  uh in front of the world to see um on youtube and shit yeah i don't know we just had to tell the  stories we were like old school like the indians telling the story of when you beat the kid up 
[03:32:00]  i don't know i don't have i don't have kids that age so i have no idea if it's worse i have no idea  i mean i would assume it might be a little a little more worse than when we were growing up is the result  worse is what i'm talking about like the the bullying all right everyone everyone had bullying  events or bullied people or whatever it was but did we turn into a more violent people than these  people that are being bullied now are turning into uh i i don't know like like jimmy was saying he 
[03:32:30]  comes back with a you know trench coat mafia kind of a thing um i really don't know yeah this is out of  our league because we don't have kids that age oh i know my sister she's got a 12 and a 10 and she's  she said it's a completely different world out there for kids yeah yeah completely but that's  that's her take on they are being raised softer weaker softer and i think that plays into this thank  you it does but a part of it like a lot of the like i mean like real nasty bullying there's a lot of 
[03:33:00]  fucking 40 and 50 year old fucking cocksuckers out there uh and there's a lot of people out there  that are fucked up because they were bullied that are like fucking squeamish as adults and it's like  beyond just normal competition but guys that were just tortured growing up i mean there's a  we it's a balance i can't yeah yeah but uh i i wonder what the you know repercussions there are  i don't know they are being raised like really fucking wimpy wimpy like like you kids don't go  out anymore you don't see them like riding their bikes around fucking and and just being out doing 
[03:33:30]  things that's a good point we were thrown out of the house as kids it's like get out do something  go you got home from school and you were in maybe for a quick snack right and then you were gone for  hours and then you were gone until at least dark and your mother never knew where you were you from  father they didn't know where you went they just know you went out with friends i'm going out my  friends all right whatever you did stay home maybe because it was it was still in the middle of a  snowstorm or rain or whatever yeah and it just felt weird it was weird it was inside to be yeah 
[03:34:00]  inside and then we'd go traipsing around in the woods oh yeah it turns into like lord of the flies  you're just fucking yeah throwing rocks building forts and yeah throwing things breaking shit man  you're right you don't really see kids out anymore kids aren't out they're not out playing anymore as  much yeah we had neighborhoods where i grew up where it was like every weekend you couldn't even  like drive around the adults couldn't drive around because the streets were just kids with bicycles 
[03:34:30]  and fucking you know we'd play war and shit we get little guns and you run around the yards and playing  and no one does that anymore they lock their kids up in the house to keep them fucking safe because there's  animals out there i guess i don't know or the perception the i think the news has scared the  shit out of parents too because uh i mean there are horrid people out there doing horrid things but  again is it any more than it was nah you're always going to lose a a few to some kid touching of course 
[03:35:00]  just a few happen then what are you gonna do you gotta you gotta deal with the overall numbers  yeah yeah because you gotta look at the percentage you can't save everybody percentages  we gotta sacrifice a few of the little fuckers i don't know what do kids do these days like video  games are you kidding me computers you know you don't go out and they all got phones phones  go to the mall my 10 year old needs got a phone  could you imagine having a phone at 10 how cool that would be i couldn't use the phone at 10 in the 
[03:35:30]  house like that phone i had it's like could i ask permission i could don't tie up the line  because there was a call waiting yeah don't tie it up and no long distance calls long distance who  you call long distance as a 10 11 year old yeah  anyone still doing the prank call or is it too easy to get caught too easy remember how remember how  much fun prank phone calls were as kids that was drugs for me that was doing drugs on the weekend uh 
[03:36:00]  if you had like uh friends over and uh you you just grab that phone and had the balls enough to  start dialing and making prank phone calls you would laugh your ass off and it was such a feeling of  satisfaction uh it was just the greatest thing growing up did you buy into the fact uh when the  guy on the other end said uh i know where you live and you were freaked out sometimes yeah yeah i don't  know maybe he just does i don't know there's no call waiting or anything but he goes i know where you 
[03:36:30]  live i don't know and the whole day you're just in this paranoid state like does he maybe did he  recognize my voice i think he might know oh i remember pranking uh once a bad call and this was  always the ballsiest thing you could ever do is dialing zero and pranking the operator because you  would prank the operator and uh then you'd hang up and pick up your phone and for like five minutes  you wouldn't have a dial tone like she'd pull the fucking plug on your phone right because they're  trying to trace it and you'd start freaking out like they're tracing it they're sending the cops 
[03:37:00]  you then look out the window thinking the cops are gonna come for a prank call that takes balls it  was scary i don't know if i ever did that it was usually a friend that was fucking up it's like  you don't prank the operator you it was usually the friend that discovered pot first that's like  whacking out a made man look can we just call the bowling alley that we have to call the operator  really bowling alley ask him if you've got 10 pound balls and hang up it's fucking we'll  laugh our asses off it's a classic eat a whole pack of hubba bubba it's fucking great i used to  love night is set i used to i used to call east when i was in high school we'd get stoned i used to 
[03:37:30]  call these uh these like places where nuns were where they were um where there was like this  sisterhood or whatever it was a nunnery yeah it was like a place that was it a convent i don't know  i don't know i just don't remember it was something that nuns ran or whatever and i would always call  and say that like you know my my uh older men were having sex with me and oh no you did oh yeah  constantly yeah we would just giggle how come you have to turn we're always talking about this 
[03:38:00]  innocent with my friends yeah childhood thing that we always has to take it way for you know  do you have prince albert in a can you better let him out hardy har hang up and you have to  talk about calling nuns yeah and telling him you had man dick in your ass yeah that's being sexually  abused i called a bomb i told you a bomb's threaded to the what uh um my high school  holy we were all stoned and i remember they said everybody had to leave the school walk out 
[03:38:30]  because i was convincing wow that's past 1985 i think uh the statute of limitations doesn't run out  till uh tomorrow yeah let us now you're in i was stoned what are you gonna do i was  fucking high we were all laughing my friend's house i know yeah you can't do it now i've been really  high i've never called in a bomb anywhere if you knew when i was even younger where i tried to call  i i called the white house um i was very young i was probably 12 13 and i forget how i got them i had 
[03:39:00]  the operator put me through or something from the yes hello a public library was it reagan who was in  oh you were 12 you know what 19 it was probably reagan beginning of reagan um i remember 13 yeah  it would end a carter uh and i remember calling in what would you want to say yeah to the white  house yeah what were you gonna do wow through i don't know i was just you're 12 you know you want  you wanted to see if you could do it yeah i used to call the fbi all the time you don't think you were  really on the edge i was anti-social yeah you you're really like i don't even know if it went through 
[03:39:30]  him i've just been the operator like i don't even know if she actually got me through to the white  house you were one of those kids like that if my mother like my mother used to keep tabs on on our  friends a little bit and you were one of those that she would say i really don't want you hanging  out with that boy yeah that jimmy norton boy i think you'd be that kid i never knew when the joke was  over i remember i was thinking this this morning on the way out i was listening to this song by kiss 
[03:40:00]  called do you love me at the end of the song they just keep repeating do you love me just keeps repeating  it but i remember my me and my friend lutzy we're listening lutzy yeah you don't see lutzy's anymore  no there's no there's no lutzy can lutzy come out and play i was at lutzy's house and uh  the kiss record was playing and every time they would say do you love me i would just scream no  and jump up and pretend i was stepping on the record but it happened so many times that it just got  uncomfortable and funny and his father came in and was like could you be quiet 
[03:40:30]  there we go there it is  do it jimmy yeah stomp on that record no no that's in edison though i was like in third  grade or second grade yeah no i remember this no there's just like trying to be funny  do you ever hear songs today and remember where a skip was in the song oh yeah yeah there's a  uh yeah the song before i was uh i was kiss destroyer and on the way in um you can listen 
[03:41:00]  also okay all right um there's that song called uh uh flaming youth which i don't know what that was  about paul stanley's saying but this is uh uh getting it together to break out of my cage  is the line and my record would skip it would go brage like it would ache out of my k would be  taken out and i hear that now and that's 30 years ago and i still wait for that skip that's 
[03:41:30]  up because i know exactly what you're talking about that's that's happened with a few songs where  yeah you you played them on a record so many times and it skipped in the same place yeah and uh  yeah and you hear the song now and you expect to hear the skip you ever put a nickel on it or a  penny to try to fucking make it not skip oh yeah but then it just makes the rest of the song slow  and not skipping sometimes the needle would be so fucked up it would just go right across the  whole record i was so bad okay i i used to always not know what the lyrics like i would always misinterpret 
[03:42:00]  lyrics and think they were saying other things and you would sing along to it wrong lyrics yeah  i was wrong lyrics kid wrong example no yeah yeah i was um um  no but in the beginning of do you love me the line is you really like my limousine but i didn't  know what that was at that age i thought he was saying you really like maji mozi 
[03:42:30]  what was that isn't he the contender to take over in egypt i didn't know what that meant  the contender the contender  that is embarrassing you didn't just you really did do dopey things as a kid and you kind of like  they're so embarrassing sometimes i think about it i i once we my cousins came up from uh like  maryland and uh and we went in the backyard to play and and we we i i thought we could fish 
[03:43:00]  there wasn't a lake around or anything so i dug a hole with a little spade shovel and filled it up  with water and and put these twigs with thread and and a safety pin on it in in the water hole  and convinced everybody and myself that the fish are able to dig tunnels with their tails  and we'll end up in this hole and we'll catch fish and then and then we had to go somewhere and we 
[03:43:30]  came back and the whole time we were gone all i was thinking is i can't wait to get home and and pull  this fish out of this little hole that was dug and i got home and of course the the dirt soaked up  the water in like two seconds and and it was just a little mud hole with no fish a little pile of  inoculated arms but i thought there would be fish i really was psyched but it sounds like the beginning  of a child abuse movie you know what i mean it has that creepy like it there's a weird 
[03:44:00]  innocence slash imagination going on but you know it's covering up some horrific  fucking abuse at home it was just dopey kid thinking you're on your hands and knees digging the hole  trying to block out the fact that your hiney is on fire it feels like a flame is being put into it  but it's really just the uh the average sized genitals of a much older man but it feels like  firing your backside fire in my in my bunghole and no i just i was a dopey kid who like actually convinced 
[03:44:30]  myself and it was all i would think about that the entire time we had to go to the store and i was  like oh i want to get home the fish yeah i think i started crying when there was no fish and that  could mean just horrible of course i would cry at everything i i used to steal movie lines and like  trying to make them my own oh no like what like serious ones oh yeah oh no yeah it's not like doing  funny comedy like no you would try to make people think that you came up with this i would just like 
[03:45:00]  say them like i remember there's a scene would you change it if i had to but i remember there's a scene  and a guest was coming to dinner where sydney portier yells at his father his father was like a postal  worker my dad was too so i used the same speech on my dad no it was i remember seeing that yeah did he  know you were using it i don't know he had to wait a minute that was a big movie there's one line 
[03:45:30]  in there that says you think of yourself as a colored man i think of myself as a man i don't  think i said that yeah i wouldn't have uh thrown that and probably not appropriate it's embarrassing  do you remember one line from it that you actually said to him about postal worker it was something  about um i don't care if you carry that bag 30 or 90 000 miles you did what you were supposed to  do because you owed me like as the sun it was a good speech it's a pretty good monologue because  it was written by a fucking like an academy award-winning writer it was pretty good by 
[03:46:00]  when sydney poitier said yeah when he delivered it i was jimmy norton young  fucking plagiaristic jimmy norton it wasn't bad it wasn't as good when i was standing there on my  steps in north brunswick like in my house yelling it up at them trying to shoehorn it in  i'm just trying to use it and they were just reading the paper ignoring me cares that's  hilarious auditioning little faggot oh how fucking oh cringy dumb kid stuff whoa reagan's stepping

[04:05:30]  went in to through kuwait and then we flew into um we did uh talil kirkuk and baghdad twice and  we were supposed to go to one more place uh maybe it was talil we was tried to land in one place we  couldn't because of the fog so we had to do we had to do two days in uh in baghdad instead of one  there's one location we lost scary did you take blackhawk no we took no helicopters we took all um  oh god with the a uh the fucking uh oh the amphibious no no no the uh those armored personnel 
[04:06:00]  carry-on c uh apc c-130 c-130s c-130 in every base every base he wanted to have big bases yeah  and we had enough space in between each one and there was one flight where uh we had to get  diverted to another airport and that's we hopped on ricardo sanchez's plane no no this is an  iraq i thought you were over there and now we got to ride with him he was running the all troops  so yeah in iraq with right with him was he clean or was he dirty  right what a hack but he was he was he was the top officer of oh yeah and uh so it was really 
[04:06:30]  weird to watch his delta team get off and fucking like secure the area before he left the plane you  mean it was weird to see real men jimmy is that what you're talking about i literally i couldn't  have felt more like a fucking they handed me a helmet and a blonde wig you're used to being handed a  helmet so i am and the blonde wig to tell you the truth daddy the beauty of colin is we were  doing the show that night and ricardo sanchez was in the audience and uh colin it just goes right to 
[04:07:00]  the mexican boxcar jokes oh i couldn't believe the balls on colin colin is i can do fucking  mexican boxcar jokes to the fucking commanding officer yes he's right there and the soldiers  people with guns with guns it was great great trip so yeah we saw a good very cool man performed in  his palaces and uh that's very good of you by the way that is you know oh no i demanded money  i'm like i don't do i don't take anything on the arm because you take it for granted but but that is 
[04:07:30]  dangerous you you went you put yourself in a tad bit of harm's way to uh yeah to bring some  lofts that's why jesse ventura annoyed me so much yeah that military card oh yeah i know i'm not  he did but we had an argument i'm not as brave as those guys by far but i did volunteer to go into  a war zone you mother fucker and he probably was in a motor pool in saigon the entire time  probably the first chopper out in 74 and are you saying that i wasn't in this shit 
[04:08:00]  when you ask him what he did though he doesn't answer no he doesn't because he was a he was a frog  man but he calls it a navy seal now because the frogmen were uh absorbed into the new  dts right the navy seal so he says he was a navy seal which he never  and it could just be semantics but bah and and i'd love to know what he did i don't talk about my  missions what were you and i had to change a tire once for a corporal it was unbelievable the action  what happened where where were you yeah saigon till when till the chinks came then i left when 
[04:08:30]  charlie like i i know he he wasn't in any he tried to eat a jeep like clinger  i went that's where he got his boa trying to get a section eight  his ass was the ho chi man trail his job was to clean the foreskin of sophie the horse  even though that was a woman 
[04:09:00]  it's the proverbial piece of baklava  i love how everyone on mash had the most ridiculous vocabulary in the end these giant words  isn't he a high school dropout from toledo what that is true yes yeah what does he say proverbial  for looking back on mash the humor doesn't work for me anymore  no i love a lot of the uh serious stuff they did and we lost a mash guy who who was it it's  in the paper what a guy who directed yeah yeah i didn't recognize his name oh you don't recognize  his name i like the ones my my brother always points out the best chunk the best run on mash the 
[04:09:30]  best era era is when bj before he grew the mustache when frank burns was still there yes yes  those episodes are amazing because and those are actually a lot of them are really funny because  those were the first where they would do episodes without plots it was just we're in the operating  theater and there's nothing really overall happening it's just a bunch of little events  yeah they're kind of drinking or playing poker or something and then they're just trying to get  through the night and so yeah yeah this is great there's no they're not setting up any goofy jokes 
[04:10:00]  it's just real life yeah it felt really cool  fucking frank but they said that was one of the greatest regrets they had about mash  that they didn't allow larry linville to develop his yeah who he was because he was a funny  character but they left him one level and they could yeah and they could have added and i always say  if mash were made today the top comedian the star on the show would fight to play frank burns and  not hawkeye because now if you notice the all comedian the best comedian characters people like larry 
[04:10:30]  sanders and david brent from the office they want to play the damaged assholes right and not the  self-righteous guy a little more exactly and if you had like if you made mash now like will  farrell would want to play frank burns and not hawkeye and who would be amazing at it because  you could do great satire i want oh god when when do we get to the point where we can make uh war  sitcoms uh again um hogan's heroes eventually hogan's heroes always made me laugh because it's like 
[04:11:00]  even as a kid i i what i didn't quite feel right about hey it's a sitcom and there's swastikas in it  yeah it was just the honest thing it's like canned laughter's going off and there's a picture of  hitler and they're they're fucking yeah yeah it's like hey that's a little odd who the  fuck was in charge back then yeah to allow that to happen it's a sitcom about nazis it's a talent  show being run by oscar schindler who's in charge of the network no the nazis all right they made him 
[04:11:30]  look a little goofy and stuff wasn't it the guy that played clink um because i think his he was  jewish yeah he was jewish and i think some of his relatives died in the verner verner klemperer  klemperer and yeah and he said i'll take this role but clink can never win he always has to lose  yeah he would be the goofy guy that he has to be the butt of the joke yeah yeah yeah oh it would be  great if they wrote an episode where he had to actually kill all of hogan's heroes  yeah and look amon gert is doing the eyebrow raise 
[04:12:00]  he's a card all right he's a card  hogan get your men have them dig ditches dig a big long ditch in the woods  hogan she left the ring in the tongue i can't laugh after all that red dress that shouldn't be  colorized what a nut  to a slide every time amon shoots out the window  the prop ricochet shot yeah oh and then he's talking like i feel like my 
[04:12:30]  bullets it's like all like veil direction jokes i feel like my bullets are just going two inches  and falling down  people are dying it's horrific yeah oh having a barbecue today not exactly  they were always trying to rig uh rig the old ball bearing plant to blow up hogan and his men they'd  have to go out the tree stump and come back and and again as a kid i didn't quite understand like  what they were doing i was like if they're out of the camp why don't they just keep going yeah i 
[04:13:00]  never understood heroics like you're a kid so it's not like you don't understand what a a a guy that  would have a mission or something it's like hey they're out why don't they just fucking leave yeah  let's go why is he going back it's going back i just remember that here that theme of that show  is a big part of my growing up because it does always seem to be playing in the background in the  background on some tv with a drunk relative laughing at it god damn why'd they lose i wish we'd had  hogan when i was in the arden forest we could have used that son of a bitch a tunnel under the dog 
[04:13:30]  house look at that it's lifting up and the dog doesn't even care stupid nazi dog he likes him  see because even the dog's pleasant my wife doesn't fuck  oh yeah hogan's heroes was it you know that you know that we're we're finally we'll finally get  over 9-11 as a nation when in 60 years they make a cheesy pearl harbor style romance yes titanic style 
[04:14:00]  movie about about it where it doesn't really matter the the horror of it it's more the romance well  there's there's a young stockbroker yes in the tower and he's in love with a sandwich girl and she's  trying to work away so all that's happening in the backdrop of that morning and that morning  they're in the tower as it collapses and have to proclaim their love like you know that's coming  yeah you know that's maybe not soon but it's all enough time goes by and we've always talked about  this um i i was i was uh well and people took this for granted it's like you you watch a party going on 
[04:14:30]  or a little fair and kids are sliding down this ship that looks like it's halfway into the the lawn  and it's a water slide i've seen that and it's the titanic ride i know and it's like they made a  ride out of a shipwreck where thousands died in frigid waters yeah and the most horrific death  it's yeah and then enough time went by where it was an inflatable ride that children you know and 
[04:15:00]  they're bouncing off the smoke stack and we this is fun there's just there's salt and pepper shakers you  can get it it's the titanic sinking it's the thing sticking up yeah i'm so when will the world  trade center be like a ride where maybe even a bigger one at uh uh mgm oh like like twilight  tower terror yeah oh my god something like that where it's like whoa hey the world trade center  ride look out people if you told people in in 41 that uh oh yeah this this pearl harbor thing this 
[04:15:30]  is gonna be a really cheesy romantic cheesy bad movie what yeah oh yeah yeah with a with a young  people and she's a nurse and he's a pilot and they're kind of in love on the island are you  this is no this is horrible this is i know people they just died no no just give it some time  people will be cool with it yeah they won't no they will they really don't worry about it yeah  what was the last comedy about a war that was made was it was it mash i'll say that not that this  is a sitcom but uh we've told we had chris morrison young lions about the four suicide bombers oh my 
[04:16:00]  oh four lions i'm sorry all right all right four lions young lions was brando was that science was  was that really loved totally comedy yes yes i know i saw it it was great it was great chris morris  that guy any any comedian that has to flee the country after the episode of your show  the one he did you ever see the brass eye no i've heard i know i'm familiar with it but he did this  thing about the danger of pedophiles it's a fake news show so then they show but it's more about 
[04:16:30]  the hysteria about pedophilia it's not actually about because at the time in england people were  going nuts that they burned down a pediatrician's house they didn't understand the difference yeah  that's how crazy it got so one point he's doing this hidden report and it's just a picture of a  school he goes this clever pedophile has disguised himself as his school  and um and then he had to leave england people were calling for his head wow and of course the  point he was making about all the news program hysteria then they did all these shows but how 
[04:17:00]  awful his show was and totally proved his point when it went when it boo that's it for the worst of </pre>
