<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a "worst of 2013 so far" compilation. This featured a studio interview with Jeffrey Tambor, promoting *Arrested Development*.  The conversation covered his experiences on *Injustice for All* (including anecdotes about Al Pacino and the film's music), *The Ropers*, and his thoughts on *Arrested Development*'s success.  Mick Foley, a fan of the show, joined the interview, gifting Tambor a Santa Claus t-shirt.  Clips from a previous Courtney Love interview were also played, where she discussed Amanda Bynes, the music industry (mentioning Anthony Kiedis and Dave Grohl), Eric Erlandson, Kurt Cobain's belongings (including the theft of some items), and her experiences with Kurt Cobain's guitar collection.  A bit featuring a drunken Jim Norton impersonation concluded this segment.

The show then transitioned to a longer conversation with Courtney Love, which also featured Louis C.K. as a guest.  Love discussed the difficulties of finding a resting place for Kurt Cobain's ashes (due to his suicide), detailing their current locations (including a Tibetan stupa and under a willow tree), and humorous potential solutions (like replanting the tree in Central Park).  She also aired her frustrations with ongoing legal battles concerning Nirvana's finances and the lack of transparency.  Speculation about Love potentially becoming a judge on a reality show like *American Idol* followed, punctuated by playful banter.  Louis C.K. discussed his year-long hiatus from *Louie*, explaining his need for a creative reset and escape from the show's pressures.  He shared anecdotes about his meeting with network executives, filming his stand-up special (including a humorous encounter with Nicolas Cage), and the technical aspects of filming, including camera angles and lighting.  Love also recounted a boat incident, her new, larger boat, and her frustrations with the invasive nature of fame and its impact on her children, contrasting her experiences with fans to Louis C.K.'s.

Next, a segment with Sam Roberts began by discussing the frustrations of paid online content.  This led to "Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2013 So Far," which surprisingly included a studio appearance by Roger Daltrey of The Who. Daltrey discussed his Teen Cancer America charity and its work providing specialized care for teenagers with cancer.

The show then shifted to a bizarre "Tequila and Donut Day," orchestrated by E-Rock.  This involved multiple tequila shots by E-Rock, donuts from Roland, and the participation of studio employee Dennis, who showcased his DJ skills and discussed the New York Islanders.  Rich Voss and Joe Curry were mentioned as scheduled guests.

The "Tequila and Donut Day" continued with Ira (a weatherman impersonator), Dennis (a radio DJ specializing in 60s music), and Rich Vos (a comedian) joining the tequila shots and discussions.  Ira performed his weatherman impersonation, and Dennis shared stories from his early radio career, including introducing Jerry Seinfeld.  The conversation touched on pay disparities in radio and the difficulties of the work.  The hosts encouraged other SiriusXM employees to join, and 60s music played between discussions.

The tequila-fueled segment continued with Taylor (a female DJ from Cosmo Radio), who engaged in a drinking competition with the hosts and guests including E-Rock, Handsome Johnny Tubestakes, and Pepper Hicks.  Taylor discussed her marriage and complaints about her husband, mentioning her mother's influence.  Sal, a regular on the show, expressed disapproval of the excessive drinking.  Anthony and Opie engaged in banter with Sal and other guests, leading to arguments.  Past stunts were also discussed.  Iraq became emotional, though denied awareness of it.  The segment concluded with continued drinking, banter, and discussions about upcoming appearances by Rich Voss, and farewells from the guests.

The final segment focused on E-Rock's departure.  Opie, Anthony, and Denny debated whether E-Rock should have said a proper goodbye, using frequent profanity and irreverent humor.  The discussion included interruptions and vulgar exchanges.  The segment ended with E-Rock's final song, "Working for the Weekend" by Loverboy, played without introduction, as requested.  The hosts made several references to other radio stations and DJs.

[00:00:30]  So far with me, Sam Roberts  I hope you've been enjoying this all week long  As we're highlighting some of the great moments  That have happened on the Opie and Anthony show this year  We're only into July  And already we need a highlight show  That's how great it's been  For instance, today alone  We'll be listening to some of the great in-studio appearances  From guys like Louis C.K., Roger Daltrey, Courtney Love  Today, today is the day that you get what you've asked for 
[00:01:00]  We finally listen back to Tequila and Donut Day  One of my favorite days in my whatever it's been  Eight or nine years with the Opie and Anthony show  But before we get to that, Jeffrey Tambor was in studio in 2013  Of course, it was a giant year for television  It already has been anyway  As Arrested Development came back  One of the greatest comedy shows in recent memory  Came back to television, kind of  It got a new season on Netflix 
[00:01:30]  Which has not happened before  But Jeffrey Tambor was in studio to promote that  And you never know when you have these guys  Who are like, in Jeffrey Tambor's case  A legendary character actor  But just an actor on a show  Who is hilarious as that character  You never know what you're gonna get  When you meet them in person  You never know what you're gonna get  When you interview them  Thank God  Jeffrey Tambor happens to be  He goddamn hilarious  This is Jeffrey Tambor  On the worst of 2013 so far 
[00:02:00]  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013  So far  Is that my thing?  What is it?  Oh my God, you don't recognize it?  It's the Ropers  Oh  My uncle used to play this when he tickled me  Let's talk more about that  I think that's a whole hour right there  Oh it is, and we got that hour  Remember that Norman Felt dancing with the plunger?  I love my Norman  We used to go to lunch the day of ratings 
[00:02:30]  On Tuesday  The ratings would come out  And there would be this sweat  On his upper lip  Because I think the deal with Norman was  After a certain number  He couldn't go back to Three's Company  Right  And that was  Norman was an intellectual  Did you know that?  No  Oh  Yeah  Did you, Mick?  I did not know that  Wait, why couldn't he go back to Three's Company  After a certain number of episodes?  Contract  Oh, okay  Yeah  Those were different days  How long did you guys last? 
[00:03:00]  I think we did two seasons  I didn't think we would do one season  I just said, oh, I'll just do this  And I didn't know anything about television  I knew nothing  But I had so much fun  Get this  The same year I did The Ropers  I did Injustice for All  Oh  Wow  And so there it is  I mean  Wow  The same act it does The Ropers  No kidding  That's showing a little range, huh?  Yeah  Which, by the way, as you were talking 
[00:03:30]  As you were talking about The Ropers  And Norman Fell  I was thinking of your monologue  In Injustice for All  When you go to Pacino's house  And you're drunk  And fucking Earl Soames did it again  It was  I was so nervous  Such a great movie  That was the first film  I didn't know what a mark was  I didn't know  I didn't know anything  I didn't know what  Oh, there's a thing called an apple box  Yes  And if you go out of frame  You know, I had  My first shot  I had a Belize  And I kept going out of frame  And the guy said  Do you want to put that on an apple?  Do you want an apple or a half apple? 
[00:04:00]  And yes  I said  No, thank you  I'll wait for lunch  And that's when  Oh, no  I'd never done a film  I didn't know what a mark was  That's unbelievable  That would have been so  That would have been a great joke, though  What?  If you could have played it off  Like you meant it  Oh, your uncle called, by the way  What did he say?  He said  Just come on over tonight  He's dead  I killed him, self-defense  Really?  Yeah  Because it was really  It was very  Because it took him a long time  To say that 
[00:04:30]  What was your question?  I just wanted to tell you a question  I just think that would be  That would have been a good joke  You could have played it off as a joke  Which one?  He said  I'm waiting for lunch  Oh, no  I was too nervous  You know, my father told me  Always ask a question  I was too nervous  Thank you, Jeff  What do you mean  Always ask a question?  I adjusted Jeffries' microphone  And if you have a question  Like you say  Are we on TV?  Or are we on  Ask a question  But I was always too nervous to 
[00:05:00]  I was always too proud  You know  And you gotta ask  You know  I mean  I did not know  That when you do a close-up  That they measure it  With a  You know  I didn't know  Any of this stuff  Thank God  For Al Pacino  He just took care of me  Yeah  Yeah  He knew it was your first film  Everybody  Have you done anything  As fun in a movie  As throwing those plates  Down the hall  How much fun was that  You know 
[00:05:30]  In the Baltimore courthouse  There's still chipped marble  Oh, really?  Yeah  Because I threw real plates  No kidding  And I went there  The day before  And I was  I was a very different  Kind of actor  Than I am now  I rehearsed too much  I went to the theater  Three and four hours  Before the performance  I was not  I was not improvisational  I worried a lot  So I was  I actually ruined  That movie  Which is a very  Very fine movie  With worry 
[00:06:00]  I can't watch it  Really?  Yeah  Don't worry  That's a great movie  The only thing I didn't like  About Justice for All  Was the music  I thought the music choices  Were a little weird  Like certain movies  Have weird music  Are we asking you  For your  No, not at all  I was literally  Are you weighing in?  No  No, I was always  Segwaying back  Into how good you are  Oh, okay  Well, let's just  What are some of your opinions  Have you read any good books lately?  Tell us  What you're thinking  It was coming back  To how great you are  Yes, I was just using it  As kind of a springboard  Back into your wonderfulness  It was just a little bridge  To get back to how great you are 
[00:06:30]  I'm trying to remember  Who that was  Because it was a very  Very big composer  Yeah  Yeah  Jeffrey hated it too  I had a problem  With the movie too  But I'm not sure  I want to bring it up  What was your problem?  Oh my god  Don't bring it up, Mick  It's seeing John Forsythe  In Bondage Gear  After knowing him  Remember that?  How great was that?  Charlie  Charlie and Blake Carrington  And now he's in Bondage Gear  Do you know what I did not know?  I didn't know what to do  On your day off  Because  And I would just go to the set 
[00:07:00]  I did not know  I did not know  What to do with that energy  You know  It was just very weird  Can we look up  Was it weird for you?  To be on set?  Can you go online  And look up the composer  Of  And Justice  And Justice for All  How great  And then would you check  Why was the music bad?  It was just weird  It was weird  Is it because it doesn't  Hold up?  No it's just a bizarre choice  Or at the time it was still bad  Pacino was running up the street  In one scene  They just need it right?  Dominic Chiannis was in that movie  He was  Played as  He was great  He was fantastic 
[00:07:30]  He was a good friend of mine  Yeah he was great in that  Forsythe was great  Hang a man for armed robbery  How about Jack Warden?  Amazing  I remember I was going to  He says where are you going?  I said  I'm going to Daly's  And he said  What are you doing that for?  And I said  Oh because I want to check it  He goes  What if you don't like them?  And I went  You're right  I never went to Daly's  You ever see a Jack Warden movie  Called Use Cars  Where he played two roles?  Oh my goodness  Have you seen him in The Verdict?  Have you seen him in The Verdict? 
[00:08:00]  Yes or no?  I don't remember  Then forget about it  He took your money  I think I did  The Verdict is one of the great movies of all time  Did he play a judge?  In The Verdict  No he played Paul Newman's sort of friend  I did see it then  I remember the Newman in that book  No you're lying  No no no  I would never lie to you  I would rather just be  What do you want me to look up?  Composer  Composer and Justice for All  Yeah it's dot dot dot and Justice  And then could you look up Merrill Lynch? 
[00:08:30]  I want to check my balance  I'd love to know your balance  Mick Foley's here because he's a huge fan of Arrested Development  I am  And I know that's why Jeffrey Tambor is here  In the end  Am I here for four hours?  You can hang for four  We're not going to be here but enjoy yourself  I don't understand what am I doing?  Promoting Arrested Development  I really don't know what you're doing  Do you know I did a series somewhat based  Do you know about this?  What?

He's not proud of the Oingo Boingo  But he's done Batman  He's done so many great  Weird science  Yeah  Remember?  Well yeah that was pre  He's the Oingo Boingo guy  He actually  What's wrong with that?  There's nothing wrong with being the Oingo Boingo guy  But he's done so many great compositions  Since then  Can we get back to Jeffrey please  And how much I loved when he fucking took his toupee off  And went hello Arthur  Nice day  And then put it back on like it was a hat  And there were two endings  One was Chris Lottie  Whistling through her fingers like 
[00:10:00]  Atta boy  And there was that ending  Which was the original ending  That Barry and Valerie wrote  And get this  I just did the Phil Spector story  With Al Pacino  Oh my god you played Cutler  That's right  And Barry Levinson  Was the exec producer  That's  This is why God made a circle by the way  I mean unbelievable  You played Bruce Cutler  Yeah I did just see that  I thought it was fantastic  You know Bruce Cutler?

[00:10:30]  Yes  John Gotti's lawyer  Yeah  Sure  What did he call him?  He's going to brucify you on the stand  That's what Gotti would say about Bruce Cutler  Because he was such a good fucking cross-examiner  Jimmy ranted about the movie  I thought it was amazing  Yeah  And it was  I didn't know  I knew what some of Spector's work  Yeah  But to watch Pacino work that  And just see how crazy he was  When he saw Ronnie Spector  It was fucking  And Helen Mirren  Oh she was fantastic  Helen Mirren's in the movie  Oh you want to talk about Helen Mirren again?

[00:19:30]  Ropes are a little  Too tight  And you know  When I pulled out  Of the ropes  And I'd had my ears  Injured before  So when I was  Down on the mat  I could see the blood  Dripping down  Pretty quickly  And I thought  Geez you know  The ear is mostly cartilage  It's not likely  To bleed back there  And we had this  Unique situation  Because our two  English speaking referees  Had been sent home  One because of knee injury  One due to a death  In the family  We had a French referee  Who was unable  To tell us  That he had  My ear  He couldn't just show you 
[00:20:00]  You know what  It all goes by  There's a grainy  There's some footage  On the new DVD  Handheld from Germany  And he actually  Hands it to the  To the ring announcer  Who can be seen  Like literally  Running to the back  With it  And we kept wrestling  That's what I'm going to watch  When I go to bed now  And do you want to hear  A story  I was talking to the guy  That's Jeffrey Tambor  I don't often  Drop an F-bomb  But I will hear  And you have to preface this  But I have to preface this  By saying Booker T 
[00:20:30]  Is a tough dude  In the world of wrestling  He did some time in jail  And he's written about  For armed robbery  And he got into  Wrestling  Tough guy  And he was on his  First overseas trip  With the group  I was wrestling with  And he said  When I walked in  This is his first glimpse  Of me  I walked in  I just lost my ear  And I walked in  And I said  I think I just lost  My fucking ear  Bang bang  Which was the catchphrase  And Booker T  Said he was in the corner  Going  I'm not sure  This business is for me  Oh my god  Because you're kind of 
[00:21:00]  On that adrenaline rush  That's what happens  After you've been injured  You come down  After that  But you're a young man  Are you 40?  40  Almost 48  Jeffrey  Thank you  Yeah  Appreciate that  You do look young  Yeah you look good  Appreciate that  And now I know  People come up to you  And say  There's always  Can you say  There's always money  In the banana stand  A young man  Came up to me  In the airport  The other day  And I said  You want a picture  He goes  I just want you  To do something  Oh my gosh  Well dressed

[00:33:30]  Walking  And she doesn't realize  That her lettuce  Is falling out  And her lettuce  Falls out of the bag  And all of a sudden  You  And I fly  And I catch her lettuce  And I place it back  In her bag  And I say  There you are ma'am  And what does she say  Oh thank you grocery man  Of course  I zip away  Thank you grocery man  I fly away  It's a blurb  On page 26  Of the paper  Grocery man  But meanwhile  I'm flying over  And around rapes  And child kidnappings 
[00:34:00]  And I'm ignoring them  To help someone  Like I'll zip into  Like the Whole Foods  And just as the guy  Is about to put  The heavy milk  On top of the eggs  I  Oh  I grab  I grab the milk  Out of his hand  And I say son  Look at the bottom  Of that bag  Oh  And he'll say  Oh grocery man  Thank you  I forgot there were  Eggs in there  Wow  Don't put that  On the eggs  I'll say  And all of a sudden  I go  And I've got a  Plastic bag out  And I put his milk  In it  And I fly away 
[00:34:30]  Do you bag groceries  For old people  Real quick  Yes I do  If they have to  Do it themselves  Yeah yeah  All of a sudden  Just like  The old lady  Is paying  Oh my arthritis  Is bothering me  And she's looking  At all her groceries  Pile up  Off that  The little conveyor belt  And then she pays  Then you're  And all of a sudden  I'm there  And I give her  The salute  And all her bags  Are in the car  Wow  And I say  Have a safe trip home  Ma'am  Oh thank you  Grocery man  And I fly out  Yeah and you fly out  And there's somebody 
[00:35:00]  Getting fucking robbed  In the parking lot  Yes there is  Pistol whipped  Yes  The gentleman of color  Is taking the butt  Of his gun  And caving it  Into the nose  Of another old woman  But since she has  No groceries  I allow that  I allow that to happen  Grocery man  It's the worst  You have a code  Yes yes  It's about the groceries  I'm only here  To help with groceries  Yeah  That would do well  At the box office  Oh yeah  Priorities  There's the one scene  Where the woman  Is walking with her groceries  And in slow motion  You see the handle break 
[00:35:30]  Oh shit  That'll happen  And the groceries  Begin tumbling  Oh man  And meanwhile  I'm somewhere  And I just  You see me look up  You can sense that  I sense the groceries  Are falling  And then I jump out  The window  And I change into  My outfit  As I'm falling  And I fly down  With a fresh bag  And I catch  All of her groceries  Wow  Before they hit the ground  That's pretty quick  Yeah  And I just put them  In her bag  And I go  Here you are ma'am  And I take the other bag  No littering  And I fly away 
[00:36:00]  Oh man  That's pretty good  Yes it is  Is there a scene  In the movie  Where something  Happens to you  And you're not  Available  And somebody's  Groceries maybe  Fall out of  The back of their  Truck while they  Load it up  And it's like  And then everybody  Stops and looks  And they're like  Where's grocery man  Yes  You see milk  It's in the slow motion  The milk hits the sidewalk  And the milk splatters  In slow motion  Oh boy  And everyone stops  Like traffic stops  And they all just  Look at the milk  And they know  Grocery man is 
[00:36:30]  Injured  Mama  We're grocery man  Grocery man  Pick up grocery  And I'm wearing  Pick up grocery  My grocery man outfit  Is like a green cape  But it's the consistency  Of lettuce  This is terrible  No it's not  Do you have a symbol?  Um  Oh yeah  Yes  Is there like a grocery symbol  When there's trouble?  Yes there is  Like uh 
[00:37:00]  It'll just be  A tipped over bag  With items  Falling out  Oh wow  Is that on your chest?  No  My chest is a  Paper bag  With two healthy handles  And a smile on the front  Which signifies  Happy groceries inside  Grocery man will come  I fucking hate  Grocery man  Why he's helpful  He's not helpful  Yes he is  He's so  Not helpful  Yes he is  He flies in a lot of times  Like somebody will be going  To take an item off the shelf  That's past the expiration date 
[00:37:30]  Oh wow  And as they go to put it in their cart  All of a sudden  It flies by  And it's out of their hand  What if there are a bunch of  Bad grocery things  Happening at one time?  He just fucking  Is that quick  Wow  I go everywhere  He takes care of everything  He's just fucking that quick  And they go to put something  Into the car  Past the expiration  And he snatches it  Out of their hand  Wow  Do you chastise people  For leaving their carts  Like across the aisle  When you're trying to  Fucking get through  And they're looking  For some stupid shit 
[00:38:00]  But they block  The whole fucking aisle  So there's a  I'm telling you the climax  There's a scene  Where there's a guy  Pushing carts  And he's got like  50 carts  But there's a car  Coming  Down there  And he doesn't see  The car guy  And grocery man  Flies in  And lands right in front  Of the car  And puts his hand up  In the stop motion  And the car stops  And then he waves  The carriage guy  Across the street  Oh my god  What an insignificant hero  Yeah it doesn't even

[00:42:30]  All the great moments  That have happened  On the Opie and Anthony show  In 2013  And we're only in July  This is the worst of 2013  So far  With me  Sam Roberts  While Opie and Anthony  Are on vacation this week  We're looking  At the year that was  Before  It's the year that was  Courtney Love  Was in studio  A few months ago  We didn't know  What to expect  From Miss Courtney  She's  She's a little unpredictable  Okay  Yes  She's had a rich history 
[00:43:00]  In rock and roll  And she's got a lot  To talk about  But she's also known  For possibly being nuts  Being difficult  We don't know if she's  Going to be a good  Interview or not  So what do we do  We take a chance on it  We see what happens  And what do we get  One of the greatest  Interviews of this year  Maybe of all time  Courtney Love  She gives us all kinds  Of dish  About the rock industry  Anthony Kiedis  Dave Grohl  Everything you ever  Wanted to know  It's Courtney Love  On the worst of 2013  So far 
[00:43:30]  ONA's worst of 2013  So far  What do you think  Of Amanda Bynes  You tweeted her recently  Oh yeah  That thing  That thing  I think she likes  The word ugly a lot  Yeah  She is that for everybody  It's like  What's that about  Listen  I was 14  I was so bloody ugly  And I thought  I was Kate Moss  I chased this guy  Named Mark Rennie  Who was the hottest  Photographer in Portland  Around  Convinced him  I gotta show you guys  These pictures  They're so ugly  You know  I had this big schnoz 
[00:44:00]  And I had like  Blusher on like this  And I'm wearing  White gloves  And black and white  And I'm like this  Like making new wave faces  Oh nice  And I am so fucking homely  And I think  And I gab my teeth  And I thought  I was the hottest  Thing in the world  And I was 180 pounds  Wow  So if someone calls me ugly  It sort of rolls  Off my back  Because like  It's not about looks  It's about attitude  I mean you get laid  On attitude  That's  But didn't you think  That was kind of shitty  Because you kind of like  You didn't say anything  Bad to her 
[00:44:30]  No what I said back to  Is you misunderstood me  And  Well your tweet was  Get it together dude  I think  No the first was  Something like that  Get it together dude  Because you're so crazy  Yeah yeah of course  The wig and this and that  Oh yeah  And marijuana isn't a drug  Come on  And clearly  Marijuana is a drug  At least other drugs  And then there's  Then there's this whole thing  About like Disney kids  Just like  They're not educated  Look at how she writes  You know  I'm not educated either  But I'm at least  Autodidactic  At least I try and read 
[00:45:00]  Flaubert  Do you know what I mean  Pronounce it correctly  And  They're  They have no parental  Infrastructure  And they just get  Like after they're not  Nubile anymore  Or useful  They're sort of  Waylaid  They just lose it  Yeah  And then we all  Pick on them  And enjoy it  Well we love a train wreck  Yeah but  Who doesn't love a train wreck  Model your thing  On Lohan  Man  Like  Right  Yeah  And we do look at  Until something tragic happens  And then everybody's like  Oh you know  She should have had help 
[00:45:30]  And this  But meanwhile  Everyone was piling on  The dog pile like that  You're gonna call them out  You know I did the  Billboard Awards once  And I refused to lip sync  And it was a huge mistake  Oh really  Why  Yeah because there's  Like this little delay  And because I thought  It was just  Can I say  I thought it was gay  Yeah  Yeah  Homosexual fans  I love you  I do say gay sometimes  Okay  I thought it was  Just lame  And  We actually sounded worse  Wow  Because they were doing  Accu-tuning back then  And whatever 
[00:46:00]  And I think Kid Rock  Said something on  The Billboard Awards  About people that lip sync  But he's gotta lip sync  We all lip sync now  Yeah  On those shows  Yeah yeah yeah  You sound like shit  Oh man  That's kind of  Why does it sound like shit  Why can't they get that sound  Like do a sound check  Earlier in the day  Yeah  I don't know  It does suck though  Have you ever heard  The Chili Peppers  Without Anthony's voice  Accu-tuned  Oh  Not going there  Sorry  Accu-tuning is something  They do live  Is that like  No no no  They can do it live  But it's where 
[00:46:30]  If you're hitting  Flats and sharps  They can  It rounds it up  To where it's supposed to be  Yeah  Puts it where it's supposed to be  It's what they did  With Mary J. Blige's voice  In my opinion  Mary J. Blige  Had this fantastic  Phenomenal  Soulful  Wounded  Great voice  And lately  What I hear  Is really accu-tuned  Yeah  And it's like  Barbie  Where are you  And have you used that  For me  Yeah  Hell yeah  Yeah  I'm white  You know 
[00:47:00]  I don't hear  You like  Those  You're not going to do that  But the live shows you do  It's all  It's all real  You don't use  Yeah  Of course  But Anthony Kiedis  Doesn't sound great live  Huh  If you take that away  I would say  Without  Insulting  One of my  Oldest friends  Who let me use  His rehearsal space  Before I even  Had a band  Therefore I wouldn't  Even be here  Without  Flea  That  Anthony's voice 
[00:47:30]  Is slightly  Banal  Without a little  Something  Something  Like reverb  Or something  Well when they first  Started  He wasn't even  On key  A lot of the times  That was kind of  The way the music  Was written too  And then later on  When they got very popular  It was more of a  Pop thing  And it needed to be  On key  And everything  Yeah  He was very loose  With his  Being either flat  Or sharp  With a lot of things  There was like  Something that was  There was like  A lack of  Personality  For a while 
[00:48:00]  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  And when you're  In studios  You hear people's  Voices naked  Which I mean  You hear your own  Voice naked  It's embarrassing enough  But when you're  Hearing other people's  Voices naked  It's like taking a look  At them showering  Yeah  I think that's why  You can never  So it's kind of like  Tattling on it  Isn't really cool  You can never really get  The impact of what  People are going to hear  On a record  You can't really tell  What people are going to  Hear on a record  Because you hear it  As you're singing it  And you hear it  Just bare  Through the cans  And every time  You listen to that song  Even through 
[00:48:30]  When they're processing it  Unless you're in love  With yourself  You can't  Well yeah  But who is  Are you  Really  What happened  With you and Eric  He took 74 guitars  From my storage  18 of them were Kurt's  They're left handed  And then when he gets  He needs money  He sell  He has sold  Like Kurt went to England  And got all these  Marshall stacks  Like 7 out of 10  Marshalls are lemons  So for a guy  With perfect pitch  Like Kurt  You know 
[00:49:00]  And Miko  Who's in my band now  Going to the Marshall factory  And getting the non-lemons  It's a big thing  Me I don't give a shit  I don't have perfect pitch  Me and Anthony  You know so  Anyway  They say hole  On one side  Nirvana on the other side  And he sold them  Oh  And  Then he sold  Like a headstock  That Kurt had broke  For like 100 grand  And  You know  It's like  There's this guy  In BC  Who collects stuff  And  He's a bit gross  Like he collects  Like syringes 
[00:49:30]  He collects pill bottles  What a goal  Paul Allen  Also has 45,000 plus  Items  That came  That are  Like basically  The contents of  Me and Francis  And Kurt's entire home  And that's a long story  And I don't want to make  Allegations against Paul Allen  On your radio show  Uh huh  Because  He's got more lawyers  Than I do  Oh boy  Oh boy  But  Wait but how would he get that stuff  I gotta ask you  Well I can tell you  But then the lawyers  Would do it  I'd have a lawyer  I'd get served 
[00:50:00]  As I walked out  Potentially a lot of money there  Obviously  And  Yeah and the less I talk about it  Probably the more  Um  Discreetly  And  It will  Be  To get that shit out of there  But you gotta be  Out of your mind about it  Obviously  Um  I'm pissed  I'm pissed that  Mostly I'm pissed that  The guitar tech  Who was really sweet and nice  Um  We found out  That he  Has  16  So there's 38  Kurt  There's only 38  Kurt guitars in the world  And 
[00:50:30]  He has  So Kurt  Eric has 17  We have 12  And then Ernie  Has the remaining  X  Amount  In a storage space  In Washington  That he loans out  To Paul Allen's museum  And  It's a matter  And he did a  Deposition  In  Canada  They got no press  And it's really a matter  Of finding out  Um  Proving  That  Paul's sister Jody  Knew about it  Cause Jody Allen  Kind of put it together  If she didn't know about it  She didn't know about it  But  How do you 
[00:51:00]  How is it like  It's like  It's almost like  In the holocaust  When they stole paintings  And sold them  Right  They were eventually returned  They did it to the Hendrix family  EMP Music Project  Did it to the Hendrix family  They came to my house  And this guy  Peter Black  He's the curator there  He showed me pictures  Of things  Like I said  Needles  Spoons  Pill bottles  You know  Things you don't want  On display  And  Asked me  And I answered the door  This is 1998  So he died in 94  So this is four years later  And I answered the door 
[00:51:30]  In his long johns  Kurt's long johns  He goes  Oh you're wearing artifacts  I'm like  No I'm wearing my dead husband's clothes  Oh my god  Dude  Like what  And then he wanted a bunch of stuff  And I figured  Paul is really rich  I'm like  Okay  Give me a foundation  I'll give you some stuff  And  They weren't playing ball  And then  I put everything in storage  With my name on it  So it said  Courtney love  Which is like a big  Fucking red flag  And then  Sometime in 03  The name got changed  To a corporate name  And it went in arrears  After 90 days 
[00:52:00]  And they did an auction  A public auction  Wow  Oh my god  But there's a good part  To it  Which is  Somebody was so stupid  They left their real name  Uh huh  So were they saying  You weren't paying  Your monthly storage bill  Yeah they changed it  To a corporate name  And what was the monthly  Storage bill  Like what was it  It was a couple hundred bucks  A month  A month  And so for that  They changed  And so  This  Whoever this person is  Paid  Something like  1500 bucks  For  18 holds 
[00:52:30]  Wow  I got everything  And Frances asked me  Recently for this chair  Of her dad's  And I'm like  I don't have it  Oof  It's an  Experience music project  So  We'll see how that goes  No kidding  Well it's amazing  How they  Bobby Fisher  The chess player  He had his  He had stuff in storage  Valuable stuff  Yeah  And somehow  Somebody else got a hold of it  And it was like  It's your personal shit  They put your name  Into a corporation  And they go three months 
[00:53:00]  Without paying it  Then they put a little  Teeny ad  In like Bethlehem, Pennsylvania  That says  You are going to  Have a sale  Or  You know  Acme  LLC  Woodside 944  Is having a sale  That way your name's  Not on it  So nobody comes  So no one knows  What they're selling  And only one person  A sale  I understand  I understand  Wow  And they take it all back  That's sleazy man  Who has the  It was in Anaheim, California  Who has the lead belly guitar 
[00:53:30]  You mean the Nixon now  Wasn't  Didn't Kirk get a lead belly guitar  He did have one  I don't know where it is  Ernie may have it  The last guitar he played  On Unplugged  Frances Wants  So she wants to keep that  Who has that  That's an art pack  I have that  Oh you have that  Frances and me  Who lives in the old house  What old house  In Seattle  Yeah  The old house that we lived in  Yeah  This Microsoft lady  Who doesn't win  The little kids  That come next door  For their pilgrimage  Oh really  Yeah  It's a really waspy  Neighborhood too 
[00:54:00]  That's where Howard Schultz  Starbucks guy  Had a  He pulled a 1901  Easement on me  So I couldn't build  A driveway  Because the city of Seattle  Picked on him  And then he charged  The city of Seattle  With anti-Semitism  Hired Rogers and Cowan  Wow  Da da da  And we  Our kids  His kid was  Same as his  Franny  And he wouldn't let  Her play with him  Which I thought  That was snotty  And he had built  His driveway  Like seriously  Two inches  Onto the thing  Veretta Park  But it's so waspy  And it really is  An anti-Semitic town 
[00:54:30]  Really  If you don't like Jews  You don't like show people  That's a rule  So I remember  Going into this meeting  It's all these wasps  And it was the  Friends of Veretta Park  And if you look  At pictures of that thing  I mean every day  They have to take the  You know  Every whatever  Month  They have to take  The bench down  Because people write  Shit on the bench  Because his ashes  Aren't anywhere  Because no graveyard  In Washington  That's in the  Willamette Valley  Will take his ashes  Why  That doesn't sound right  So it's a suicide 
[00:55:00]  It's a felony  In Washington  It's actually  In some states  It's considered  Mental illness  But in Washington state  For insurance reasons  Because lobbies  Tend to make a lot  Of laws  Right  Suicide  Is a very  It's very high  It's very high  By men with guns  And so  The insurance lobbies  Made it into a felony  So you can't  So there's no life insurance  No life insurance  You got it  That's it  So where are the ashes  It took me by the way  I have a lot of them  Oh you split them up  A little bit  I split them up  With his mom  Yeah  And so she 
[00:55:30]  Passed them in this  Tibetan stupa  And then there's  Some under a willow tree  That we don't know  What to do with  The bloody willow tree though  Because she's moving  Out of that house  Oh shit  So dig it out  And I don't want to  Give it to Paul Allen  And so we straighten  This little mess out  So how  Dig up the willow tree  And bring it  Yeah we'll put where  I don't know  Central Park  How do you do that  It's hard to carry  A willow tree  Put it in the back of a  Willow trees are really delicate  I'll take it  I'll take it  No you can have  An arboretum guy 
[00:56:00]  Be very very delicate  I understand  But if you're going  To leave it there  We'll take it  No we can't leave it there  It's got a beautiful house  It's robust  You want the willow tree  I don't think  I could use the willow tree  I think it should be  Like a public willow tree  I think you're right  But I don't know  I don't want to do that  Yoko Strawberry Fields  Yeah yeah  Right right  It's not really me  No  At least Strawberry Fields  Is kind of protect  You want it to be  Somewhere public  That can be watched  Because somebody will take it  Yeah that's why  I thought of Paul Allen  Because he sort of owns 
[00:56:30]  What was I saying  Oh I don't know  Now I want to make sure  That this whole  Experience Music Project  Which is that museum  Thing is clean  And that my stuff  Isn't there  Right  So in order to do that  There needs to be dialogue  And there needs to be dialogue  Between lawyers  And as Shakespeare said  First thing we do  Let's kill all the lawyers  One other question  Because I think you've got to go  Yeah  Where are you at  With Dave Grohl these days  I don't know  You guys cool  I got to Pat Smear  Yeah  A little while ago 
[00:57:00]  And about two weeks ago  Pat was the only other person  In LA that could not drive  And he was also really happy  And when Kurt wanted  Somebody in his band  That was happy  He wasn't that great  A guitar player  But he was fucking happy  So I said  I know he's got  This guy is really  Really happy  And he was working  For minimum wage  At the SST Superstore  With my first husband  Paul and James  And Paul and James  Said to him  If you join that band  You're selling out  Seriously  Wow no kidding  Yeah  This guy was a tranny 
[00:57:30]  That I married in Las Vegas  It's an annulment  Holy  Backstory thing  It's in my wiki  Who knew we had so much  In common  It's in my wiki  We all do it right  Of course  Courtney Jim  Is in the tranny  So that's what I was saying  Really  I married a tranny  In Las Vegas  Oh wow  It was funny  No  Came back to the club lingerie  Peppers were there  L7 was there  Gun club guys were there  I said  I just married Paul and James  And no one laughed  Really  Now these people aren't laughing  Uh oh  I did something bad  And then 
[00:58:00]  I didn't have money  For a lawyer  For like a year  So it took me a year  To get an annulment  He was really into pantyhose  Yeah of course  So when  Kirk called Pat  At the SAC Superstore  Following Dave was there  He's like  If you join Nirvana  You're selling out  So Pat to this day  Is in the Foo Fighters  And he said  You know  Every time this shit comes up  Dave says  I have nothing to do with it  He goes  You know  Have you ever thought  That it could just be the lawyers  And that actually  Is food for thought  But  When I went on Howard 
[00:58:30]  And I said  Many years ago  I said  I'll have lunch with him  He went on Howard  And he was like  You know  Basically fuck her  So  It's not a Yoko thing about us  What it is  Is  It's not even a dislike thing  On my end  It's that  First of all  I had absolutely no awareness  Of how big they were  Until  A few months ago  When I bought my guitar player  A Telecaster  Looked up a guitar center  And saw what I thought  Was the Super Bowl  It was a Foo Fighters show  Holy fuck they're big  You had no idea  They're huge 
[00:59:00]  Arenas  We all know that  Big arenas  But how did it take you so long  To know that  That's not even the point  The point is  Is that there's a financial issue  With like  Money market accounts  Pension plans  Da da da da  Under something called  Nirvana Inc  That doesn't include Francis  And  I need to get to the bottom  Of what that is  And  Maybe it's just lawyers  Because lawyers are hacks  Awful people  In rock and roll  So  You know  But I'm so sick of lawyers  I just want to play rock  TV has never been my thing 
[00:59:30]  Particularly  What we call reality TV  Or whatever  And this isn't like  Some E-channel  Courtney's life  Thing  What TV show is it?  I can't tell you  Oh man  Because it's a network thing  So it's a big thing  Is it something that's already on  Or is it brand new?  No it's already on  Oh  Maybe like  You know  American Idol  I can't say  I just can't say  Judge or something  I just can't say  A judge on American Idol  I just can't say  That's a big gig  I just can't say  Wow you're going to be  On American Idol  That's great  That's a great gig  I did not say 
[01:00:00]  That's a great gig  Wow  American Idol  We got a scoop today  Is that this show  Is looking for  I read the demographic  Thing they're looking for  Is disaffected  I love that word  Oh  Disaffected females  And homosexuals  And therefore  There is only one person to call  That would be me  Wait so what's show  The voice  No I get the cutters  It could be American Idol  That is true  What happened to my mic  It's on  It's on  No you muted me  No way 
[01:00:30]  You're silencing me  No  You're silencing me  Where  Who's Opie and who's Anthony  Opie  Anthony  So American Idol  That's a great gig  I did not say  Shit  See that or the voice  I'm saying  Yeah  Okay I couldn't get on the voice  If you pay  I mean  Oh okay  It's not the voice  But she's not saying no  To American Idol  I'm not saying anything  American Idol  They're knocking everybody out  What's the dance show  Dance with the stars  Dance with the stars  Cause you know  Woo  Cause my  Cause I'm sorry  My pole work 
[01:01:00]  Gives me so much  You know  I enjoyed that greatly  That you just did that  Capacity  Did you have the goods  Covered up  Very covered up  They're covered up  Yeah  Yeah with a thin strip  With a thin strip  A very thin strip  Yeah  That was a hit  She's not denying American Idol  They're getting rid of everybody  They really are  That'd be a great gig  That would be a good one  They like someone that's outspoken  Yeah  A little outrageous  Yeah  They like that on the show  Yeah yeah yeah  You'd be perfect for that show  You'd be honest  Yep  She's not saying a word  That's how it starts 
[01:01:30]  Well it's been too soft  Cause nobody's been honest  On that show for a while  Yeah  And you need that  Don't you think like  Badasses are supposed to go on there  And be badasses  And then they go on there  And there's butterflies  Flying out their asses  It's like  Yeah  Come on  Yeah  You know  Tyler even like  He was nice  They were overly nice  Well your buddy there  Howard  He  Is a bit soft  On some of the acts  I guess you can't just  Wheel in there  And go like  He's mellowing out though 
[01:02:00]  Yeah  You can't just go in there  And be like  We just had a total  Grace Kelly to  You know  We had a totally  Non-controversial  Fantastic  Yeah  Discussion  I hope I get invited back  So you think that  On the show  You'll be more outrageous  And you'll speak the truth  If someone's bad  On American Idol  Yeah  I didn't say what show it was  I'm not saying  I'm just saying  Whatever show it is  Whatever show you're judging  I just speak the truth  Right  So if someone's lip syncing  Or all that stuff  You're gonna  You're gonna call them out  You know I did the Billboard Awards once  And I refused to lip sync 
[01:02:30]  And it was a huge mistake  And I'm sorry about  Our misunderstanding  About shock jocks  It was nothing  No  It was nothing  See it wasn't shocking  We barely even mentioned this  This interview wasn't shocking  At all right  That we didn't  Yeah we weren't bothered by it  I know  We just wanted to get to the bottom  Of it  That's all  We were just  We were cool the whole time  Look we're just happy  American Idol  That's friggin' awesome  Congratulations on the American Idol  Fuckin' sad  Anything about American  Motherfuckin' Idol  More awkward moments  Can you turn your head and cough?  Epic fails 
[01:03:00]  That was a shitty joke that barbed  And fouled mouth rants  Why don't you shut the fuck up?  Coming up  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013  So far  So far  Continues  Next  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013  So far  This is it  Only seven months into the year  We're already running a highlight show  It's the worst of 2013 so far  With me  Sam  Roberts 
[01:03:30]  This year was  It was big  For returning faces  You know what I mean?  Louis C.K. is a guy  One of the great things about working  On the Opie and Anthony show  Is seeing  Some of these great comedians  That come in here  Reach that next level  You know what I mean?  You get to see these people  Louis C.K. is a guy  Who used to come on the show  Like three days a week  And then you see him  Become one of the most famous people  In the country  It's really an unbelievable thing  Especially  Good  When they don't forget 
[01:04:00]  Where they came from  Louis C.K. stopped by the show  Earlier this year  Recapped some of the boating incident  He was talking about  Filming a new special  And of course  He put  Louis  One of the most popular sitcoms  On television  He decides to put on hiatus  For a year  Right in the midst  Of its popularity  He'll tell us all about that  And do us the favor  Of bashing  Sirius XM  Into oblivion  He knows how to gain  Our favor  Louis C.K.  On the worst of 2013 
[01:04:30]  So far  What about the old TV show there  Louis  When  Come back in next year  Next year  May of next year  You just decided  Bah  Bah  Everyone else does it  Yeah  You know  Well I  That's a hard show  To do  And all the jobs  I do on it  So I kind of  Was starting  I felt like  The last season  Was good  And the next one  Would not be  I feel like  I'm on the precipice 
[01:05:00]  Of a bad season  Really  Yeah  Wow  And so I thought  Maybe I could take a year off  And spend more time  I'm not taking a whole year off  Yeah  I'm only  I'm going to spend more time  Making the show  So I start work earlier  But I had to reset it  Hit a reset button  Also  The shows  Even though the show  Is not  Seen by that many  It's still a small show  You know  It's the  The frenzy about it  And the awards  And all that stuff  Yeah  It wasn't good for the health  Of the show  To me creatively  I needed a year off 
[01:05:30]  From that  Wow  In order to keep  Doing the show right  That takes balls  Did you get any flack  From people  That won you  I mean they  They're building  Like a whole thing  The show started  Kind of a whole comedy  Thing for them  And then I had  Lunch with  The president of the network  Yeah he didn't know why  I'm taking him to lunch  And he's just  We're both having  A great lunch  And I'm like  Here I'm about to  Make his face change  It's a weird feeling  So here's what  I was thinking  And you don't want  To be leading up to it 
[01:06:00]  And I'm seeing his  Behind his eyes  Going what does this mean  And so I kind of got  So what I'm saying  Is I need to  Take a year off  And then I watch him  Take that  And he's a really  You know  Courageous and great guy  John McGrath  So he  Oh okay  You mean in the show  Your character  Is going to take a year off  We're doing an episode  We're doing an episode  About taking a year off  Take a year off  I love it  I love it  No no see  Yeah  But so I got to do it  Yeah  You should have  Like given him  A worst option first  Yeah  Like you know what  I don't want to do 
[01:06:30]  The show anymore  Yeah I kind of want to  Quit and just get out  Of the business  I'm tired of it  What  Alright maybe I'll  Just take a year off  Alright fine  Also I had no idea  You don't know  With these people  It might have been  That he would have said  Maybe you shouldn't  Come back  He might have said  Who knows  Play their hand  So it was tricky  But they were really  Supportive about it  I want to bring it back  As a musical  Like cop rock  Yeah  And then they go  No I'll take a year off  Yeah  And I'll have some  Ground to make up  People won't care as much  And the network  Won't care as much  I don't know  I think it'll be  A tremendous  Like a triumphant  Not triumphant 
[01:07:00]  But like  Coming back  Like the Sopranos  Took over a fucking year  Every time  People take years off  And when you do it  It feels like this thing  But then once it's over  It doesn't feel like anything  To anybody  Nobody cares anymore  Right  It's just television  So it's not like  I'm the police department  Taking a year off  It's just a fucking TV show  We just feel like  It would be amazing  We just feel like  We need a little  We're going to do  Something else for a year  So everybody  Just good luck  And uh  Try to be good to each other 
[01:07:30]  Keep your doors locked  Call the fire department  If you really need somebody  No they took a year off too  But uh  Yeah  And then uh  But now I'm really hungry  To get back  And I'm  I miss it a lot  So I hadn't felt like that  Are you writing though  During the  I'm trying not to write at all  You're trying not to just do anything  Not even think about it  As far as the show goes  It's a  It's a thing I've learned to do  Is to think like a farmer  Or something  Like just take  Don't  You don't want to 
[01:08:00]  Get shit out of the ground  You've got to rotate your crops  And keep the soil  Or you'll have it  That's exactly right  But being a creative guy  Doesn't something pop in your head  You're like  Oh wow  That would be a great episode  If I have a germ of an idea like that  I email it to myself  Okay  With the heading  Show idea  Right  So I have a bunch of those  And then just leave it alone  And then I leave it alone  And don't develop it  And I've just been doing it  And then I've been concentrating on the stand up  It's something I learned about sharks  At an aquarium with my kids  Sharks can't stop moving  Stop right  Yeah  You know why? 
[01:08:30]  I only kind of figured around  They don't have those moving gill parts  They don't have moving gills  They can't  They can't push water  They need the actual water  To go in their mouth  And out their gills  So they've got to keep moving forward  It would be like  If you didn't have lungs that expand  And you needed to just walk  And have  Like just have air come  If your head motion  Controlled your diaphragm  You'd have to bend over  And run  To get air to come in  What a horrible design  Oh to put fucking air in your mouth  Like a scoop  Like a hood scoop  Sharks suck  So you know  They're really dumbly designed 
[01:09:00]  So even if they stop moving for a second  They start choking  Yeah  So but they need to sleep  Just like every neurological thing  Needs to sleep  So they sleep their brain in sections  In quadrants  They sleep like a quarter of their brain  It's like Jimmy  A quarter of their brain  There's stuff  You can catch  Sometimes you'll be able to see a shark  I mean I've never seen a shark  But you could happen upon a shark  Who's asleep  Yeah  And he doesn't  He's not looking at you  He's just only doing motor skills  Whatever it is  And then he wakes up  Would he go right by you 
[01:09:30]  If he was sleeping like that  Or would he say  I don't know that much about it  I just want  There's only one follow up question  He might  Let's go  Let's get nudging  Could you put sleepy shark in the Google  I want to see if this video  Was sleepy shark  Okay so  So I figured out  I had this idea  Okay if you sleep  Certain sections of your brain  Like you just shut down  Because I do all  I'm always overworked  So I thought if I just don't  If you have the discipline  To not think about certain things  To not use certain  Yeah  Like don't do any logistical  Scheduling stuff 
[01:10:00]  For like  You know  Several hours  Don't even think about it  Only think about this thing  That you're doing  And then you swap it out  So the show is gone  From my head  For like this whole  Wow  Seven months  And then when it comes back  It'll be very rest  But meanwhile  I've been doing a stand up  Special  Right  I'm working really hard  But not at the show  Don't you feel like  I'm always afraid  If I get an idea  And I don't write it immediately  That I'm going to look at it  The next day and hate it  Like I go back over certain ideas  And I'm like  Oh you fucking stink  Like if I don't write it out  In that moment  I panic that I won't feel  That same emotion for it 
[01:10:30]  It's plus  Some stuff is like that  I think  But I don't write properly  Like for stand up  Unless I'm on stage  I can't come up with stuff  Right  So I don't  And I avoid thinking about that  Until I'm going to be on stage  So you don't want to see my notebook  In parentheses  Where I say funny face  It would be  A stroke of luck  If some guy  Coming up with a new show  Found Louie's email  And all these ideas  From my show  I was like  Louie's show's great  Critically acclaimed  Louie's got the big HBO special 
[01:11:00]  Coming out  That's exciting  The fucking  The posters are great man  I saw the bus picture  And I saw the one in Times Square  It's unbelievable  This is the first time  I had posters ever  Really  Really  My show they never did  They call it an out  I just found out  That they call it  An outdoor campaign  Because I never had one  Never had one before  My show doesn't have posters  Or anything like that  So this is the first time  I've done that  Did you have any say  In the poster  Was it all you  Yeah they showed me  A bunch of different things  Yeah  And I picked that one  Because it is really good  I notice it when I'm driving  You can't not look at it  On the subway entrances  They got those things 
[01:11:30]  So when I'm driving on the road  I see them  And they're very like  What the hell is that  It's like why would  It's a lot of white  Yeah there's a lot of white  And then I'm tiny  In the thing  That's what I like about it  Yeah you're just in the bottom  All this white behind you  It's fucking great  It's very cool  Who would present that  And think you wouldn't say  You're wasting so much space  Like that's how dumb  I have no clue  Because obviously it works  HBO has a great design department  Yeah  I don't know  I don't know  That was really smart  You need a lot more shit in there  See I would have put Louis  With a bunch of redheaded guys  And then had him shake 
[01:12:00]  And put his hands up  Like ah what the heck  Ah what am I gonna do  What am I gonna do  Because I'm just one of these  Kinds of guys  Hey that's a good idea  Could I steal that  I'm gonna use that  In a promo on my next show  That's brilliant  Yeah but you can't not look at it  All that white  And just you at the bottom  And I first saw it on a bus  And I was like  That is fucking great man  Yeah  I just hope the special  Doesn't suck  No come on  I'll find out on Saturday  I'm sure it's good  I saw a moment of it  Yeah but that's what  Everybody said about  Every shitty special ever  Yeah 
[01:12:30]  Oh I'm sure it's great  Ah it's gotta be good  It could easily suck  It's totally impossible  That it sucks  Well the managers  Or friends have never  Said that about a special  Like I shot a special  Yeah it's probably shitty  You know your friends  Never say thanks  Jimmy just filmed his  In Boston  We went up there for that  How did it go  It went really well  Summer real theater  Yep  You actually made me feel better  Because I was so panicky  About the fucking lack of  Smoke and I asked Louie  Because that's what they do  To get like lighting  A certain way  And I'm like dude  I can't use smoke  And he's like  I've never used it  It's so stupid  Never used it once  And that actually 
[01:13:00]  Is the only thing  That made me feel better  I meant to write you  And tell you that  The only thing  That made me feel better  About it was him  Well that's because  The people that are  Into the photography  Those things  They fill the room  With smoke  Yeah  So that it has  More atmosphere  And it's a giant waste  Of money  It's stupid  And you don't  The look it gives  Doesn't mean anything  Doesn't mean anything  I never did it  I've done five of these now  Never did it  Well Nicolas Cage  Gave you some advice too  About the smoke  Didn't he  I don't know  That part of our business  He just blew me off  Completely  He was on a plane  Sitting right next  To Nicolas Cage 
[01:13:30]  Trying  And you asked him  If you should use  The smoke machines  Yes  I was just  Here's what that was  Louie's fucking laughing  His balls all over  Danny's dumb question  Believe me  I would have had  More respect for myself  If I asked Mohamed Atta  That on a flight  You gotta give him  The short version  Of the whole story  Because it's amazing  I know it  I already know it  Of course you do  Hey I'm a big fan  Thank you  Thank you  No you're really great  Yeah thanks  Okay  I'm a comic  I don't know  No I guess so 
[01:14:00]  Yeah  I kind of know who you are  Yeah  Listen can I ask you a question  Yeah I guess so  And then he finally has to  Take off the headphones  Nicolas Cage  And face you  Now he has to  Take off the headphones  And face you  Yeah okay go ahead  I'm doing a stand up special  I'm not sure what that is  But go ahead  Should I use a smoke machine  I don't know why you're  It's not  I'm an actor  Louie was on the plane  I don't know why  You would ask me that  No Louie just made  Nicolas Cage like me  A lot more than he actually did  I wish that was the story  He actually would have 
[01:14:30]  Acknowledged me  Wow  It was just humiliating  Why did you ask me  Why did you ask me  Because I'm a small man  Trying to make a connection  With a movie star  He was trying his best  To get into a conversation  And before he said anything  And there were like  Three or four  Or maybe even five attempts  At this conversation  Yeah  Cross country  And before each attempt  Jimmy would play out  The scenario  And it would always end  With Nicolas Cage going  Yeah here's my number  Get in touch with me  Yeah  And it always ended  With just 
[01:15:00]  Huh  Huh  It was  It was a fucking  Five hour humiliation  Slash validation  Of what I already know  That was truly  And you were just  Trying to get a picture  And you didn't get the picture  No  I got an autograph  But  He finally gave him an autograph  But you shot in the  I saw a clip on HBO shows  Like what's coming up  And they fucking  It looked amazing  Because you shot it  In the round  In the celebrity theater  Yeah  The Phoenix  Fuck  You went in the round  Yeah  Carlin shot a special  In there  In 77  Oh yeah  And it's beautiful  And the room is exactly 
[01:15:30]  The same  It's never changed  Really  Yeah  So I got  It was about  2800 seats or something  Which is just  What I've been doing  Right  And also  I'm just sick of this  Same thing  Of like  There's the guy  With the curtain  Or whatever  Fake set  And then you kind of  Come around  Awkwardly behind him  And you see the crowd  In the distance  And I don't like  Lighting the crowd  So this way  They're all around  They're just all around you  And the crowd is a backdrop  Like everywhere  Right  You see people fuzzy  In the background  Just a fuzzy  Kind of  It's like a cartoon  When they show an audience 
[01:16:00]  In a cartoon  It's just smoshy  Fuzzy colors  But how did you feel  On stage in the round  I loved it  I did it  Is it vulnerable though  A little bit  It's just totally different  I did it  In Hyannis  They have the melody tent  I've done the round  A few times a year  For the last few years  And then  It's totally different  It's a thing where  The audience  You're always facing somebody  And you walk in a circle  It's more natural in life  To make spirals  And circles  Than straight lines  Yeah  So if you just  Give into it that way 
[01:16:30]  It's really cool  I've only done it  A couple times  And it takes  A little getting used to  Because you're always like  I've been facing  To my back too long  Did you start thinking  That way or no  Well yes  That does  A clock starts ticking  As soon as you stop moving  You feel this heat  Burning behind you  It's like being  Being a rotisserie chicken  And you stop  The rotisserie  But the stage is burning  Right  Is rotating  No no no  Some places do that  But on the show  That would have looked retarded  Oh yeah  Radio City  Not Radio City  Freaking Westbury  Westbury does that  I saw Bob Saget  In the round  And the stage 
[01:17:00]  And Dice  And yeah  The stage slowly moves  Yeah you can't film that  No you can't  And the thing  I learned  Because I did a show  In Sacramento  The same week  They have a round theater there  I did that just to get used to it  There's a few things  Like when you're on stage  In a regular stage  You want to come up  To the audience  To the lip of the stage  But in the round  The closer you get  To the lip of the stage  You're eliminating  More and more people  If you're standing  On the lip of a stage  Looking out at the audience  That's true  You're looking at  Maybe 20% of the audience  And 80% of them  Are now behind you  Wow  So the only place to be  Is either on the back 
[01:17:30]  Like standing on the lip  Of the stage  With your back  To the  You know what I mean  But you're actually  Facing more people  That would make sense  Yeah you're on the lip  Of the stage  Now if you turn around  Yeah  And face the center  Of the spindle  Yes  Now you got the whole audience  There except for  You know who's right behind you  That's right  There was a guy  There was a guy  When I did the show  In Sacramento  That theater does  They do theater  They do plays  In the round  And the guy who runs  The theater said to me  The two power spots  Are the center of the stage  And you're back  To an alley 
[01:18:00]  To a  You know  To a  Right  Right  Entrance alley  Right  So I figured that  But then  The whole other thing  Is the cameras  Because if you keep moving  Which is your instinct  You're just  You not getting any cameras  Is shot at looking  At you for very long  But I had eight cameras  All placed around  Like a gun turret  Kind of  And you just keep  Moving around  Interlocking fields of fire  Yeah  That's what you need  It's a triangulation of fire  Was it easier  Or harder to edit like that  It was weirdly easier  Because there was always  A camera that I was looking at 
[01:18:30]  Full on  And I could cut constantly  Without noticing  Right  It's like a rotary engine  Like a Mazda  Rotary engines  Very cool  The spark plugs  Catch the cylinder  As it goes by  I saw a fire  When he was  Like 1995  In Westbury  And he was  It was in the round  Was he spinning?  Yeah  Because he was so slow  He couldn't  Really fast  That's what he should do  Spin it to the point  Where the comic  Is literally hanging on  And screaming  For fear of flying off  Into the audience  They put a plastic piece  Of clear plastic 
[01:19:00]  And he was like  A subterfuge  Against the fucking  Did I say that right  I hope so  Centrifuge  Yeah I meant that  Subterfuge  It was like  Underhanded  Yeah  Hunt I am  So Nicholas Cage  Did I use the right word?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  What's wrong?  But he had cards  On the floor  It was kind of hard  To see  Because he couldn't  Remember  So he had all these cards  And he was kind of  Spinning slowly  It was really sad  To see  What year was that?  95, 96  That was something you wanted  To do a special 
[01:19:30]  So you did it  I mean like an HBO special  It was one of those things  Just for you  Was really important  Well I figured I would  Do another one this year  One way or the other  And I thought I'd put  On my website  Like the last one  Because that worked  Worked well for you  Yeah  So I figured  I'll just do that again  I knew I was going to do one  Because I knew I was going  To tour this  I had this whole tour  Yeah  And then HBO came around  And they said  What are you doing with us?  And they said they would  Make it a big event  Yeah  And I said  I don't really want to do it  Because I have my own way  Of doing it now  And I own it  And why would I 
[01:20:00]  It's better  They kind of have to match  What you could do on your own  They gave me a lot of money  And they gave me all  So that I could sell it  On my website  Just like the other one  So this was going to be  On my website in September  Jesus  And it's  I get that it's the same five bucks  And I'm not  You know  That's my own thing  How do you feel  That everyone else  Is following your lead now  And doing it your way?  No I'm not as aware  Of what other people are doing  I don't know how well  They're doing at it  I don't know  I don't think it works  For everybody  No  No guys like Gaffigan  Who has a great fan base  There's certain guys  That can pull it off  A few guys have pulled it off 
[01:20:30]  But it doesn't work  For everybody  It's not the only way  Or even the best way  To do it  No but it takes a lot  Of the  It makes the networks  Thing  It's a great thing  Because it really makes  Everybody  That's the next step  For every comic  Eventually  Although a lot of us  Can't do it yet  It's still like  The next logical progression  And it makes the networks  Harder for them  To fucking  To dictate what you do  Well here's  The thing is  Is that you don't even  It doesn't even  Have to be exclusive  To you know  Like Gaffigan's  And Aziz's  Are both on  Comedy Central now  I think  And Netflix  Mine is on Netflix now 
[01:21:00]  The one I put on my website  And I was on FX  And it was on  And now it's on Netflix  And I'm still  Still selling them  They keep selling  So it doesn't matter  Yeah  And that's what  HBO was really smart  Because I told them  I want to put it on my website  That's all mine  And I don't care  What you do  With the rest  Of the video money  And they were like  Alright  So did they make you  Name the boat  The HBO  Like yeah  Okay  How much you need  Let me tell you a story 
[01:21:30]  Exactly  But yeah  It was really  Because I was in a power position  Making the deal  So I was able to get a lot  And do it exactly  The way I wanted to do it  Good for you man  But I am happy  It's on HBO  Instead of my website  Also because it's on  There's still a lot of people  I don't need everybody  To know who I am  But people will stumble on it  On HBO  My thing that's on my website  No one's going to  Unless they know you  Yeah  It's not in the rack  That you flip through  Right  It's just in its own thing  Yeah  So the HBO thing 
[01:22:00]  Now it's more  Promotion and stuff  How is the camera  Because we were talking  About cameras to use  And we didn't use the red  We used a decent one  But I just couldn't  It was too much more money  But you used it  What did you use  I used an Alexa  On this last one  That's like the best one right  That's what they shoot  Movies on yeah  Are you happy  With how it came out  Visually  Yeah it's the best  Looking one I've done  I think  Really  Yeah  Is it that much  I don't notice  A lot of that stuff  Dude the look of your  Taping was great  I love how it came out  But I mean  I was very happy  I can't imagine  It could look even better  Than that to be honest 
[01:22:30]  Yeah with the red  Is a better camera  And that  It depends on how  You want stuff to look  And also some of it  Is the age of the thing  The Alexa  Will age quite a bit  In other words  When there's a new  Generation of televisions  Oh yeah  It'll look really good  It'll still look  The Live at the Beacon  One I actually shot  On like 4K  Which is like  A huge movie  And then we downgraded it  To like you know  To HD  But when there are  2K TVs  Which are coming  In a few years  Right you're not  Going to lose resolution  Live at the Beacon  Will look actually 
[01:23:00]  Better than this one  Because this one  The Alexa  It was smarter  Not to do 4K  It'll take 10 years  For this special  To look shitty  The Live at the Beacon  Will look good  For another 20 years  Wow man  Yours will look  Really shitty  In about 5 minutes  And it sounds shitty  Already  I'm just kidding  But when you see  The Richard Pryor special  They don't look shitty  No  Because they're on film  Yeah  You can't beat that  But you know what  Carlin's one  That I saw  That made me want  To do it there  That one is in 77 
[01:23:30]  That was shot  On some kind of beta  And it's really good  Is it really?  Kellner directed that  Right?  He did all the  Fucking Rolling Stones  Yes he did  It's also about lenses too  Because the depth of field  Makes it look so professional  Yeah  When you get that  Background that's out of focus  Yeah it makes it look  Way better  Yeah it looks great  Yeah  See I said extreme close up  All the time  I don't want them to miss  One expression  Did you?  Tee hee  Yeah  Not one wink  Cute little mug of yours  Yeah not one uncomfortable  Left eye fucking smattering  Like when you say something  Kind of naughty  But then you look like 
[01:24:00]  Yeah yeah  Like I put my chin down  And the eyebrows go up  Like you guys know  You know what I'm saying  Yeah  That's what I'm calling it actually  Come on now  You're not going to let me  Get away with that are you  Because you know me  I don't know the difference  Between shoot  We shot it  She shot it in 24p  Yeah  I don't know what the difference  They said it was good  For what we were doing  It's a frame rate  24 frames per second  Is what movies are done in  And 30 is like live television  So 30 looks like  Kind of glassy 
[01:24:30]  And live looking  And 24 looks filmy  It's kind of stuttered  Yeah it's hard to describe that  Especially the new frame rate now  What is it  48  That's what  Yeah  The Hobbit was shot  In like 50 different frame rates  And it's actually bizarre to look at  Yeah  It looks  And you can describe it  Like  It looks like a soap opera  It's like  It's got a soap opera  Well like if you go to Europe  And watch some on a PAL TV  Yeah  Like an old movie  You can watch like  Citizen Kane on PAL  And it looks like videotape 
[01:25:00]  It looks like  That's so weird  You're looking at the people  Right in front of you  Like 80's porn  When that was shot  Yes  That's what it looks like  And it looks bad  It looks cheap  Yeah  I like it to look like film  You know  What did I see that was shot  It was an old movie  I was watching  The same thing  It was like  How the fuck did this  This looks like newer  Why is it like that  A lot of TVs come like that  And you gotta set the  Hertz rate on it  Yes  Or it just looks like  Fucking shit  It's a great movie  The technology is going so fast  That it's all becoming  Just piles of versions  Yeah  No one knows how to use  Anything anymore  It's a fucking nightmare 
[01:25:30]  Like when you get a new TV  Now it's like  Like you get  Okay my cable box  Also has Netflix  And Vimeo  And YouTube  And my TV  Has Netflix  Has it  And my Apple TV  Has all  They're all on everything  My fucking Xbox  Everything I have  Has everything I have  Yes  Yes  It's a fucking mess  Like it's a train wreck  What are you  Yeah what am I using it on  What am I fucking  It's hard to focus on anything  Because everything has just got  So many different options 
[01:26:00]  Yeah  You can't focus  How are the kids  They're great  Yeah  They're great  I took them to school this morning  And they're good  We just had spring break  And we had Easter  And I had all their friends over  For Easter  Right  They're still at the edge  With coloring the eggs  And everything  Huh  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Easter bunny and all that  You like doing all that stuff  Yeah  I don't  You know  I don't like special occasions  I like daily life  Right  Right  That's more important  You know what I mean  The thing with the gifts  And the thing 
[01:26:30]  All that  Christmas is really something  You know  But it's stressful  Huh  Incredible  But I like the daily life  You know  Like I've had girlfriends  That didn't  I don't want to  I don't make everything  About Valentine's Day  And birthdays  But I get  I'm very generous  You know  And give them a lot of stuff  Just be nice  All the time  Yeah  Are the kids  Annoyed at how famous  You're getting  Yeah  Because people come up to me  When they're with me  And they hate that  They do  And now I'm on buses  And shit  And that's weird too  They don't mind that  They think that's funny  Right  But yeah 
[01:27:00]  So they roll their eyes  A lot  To me  Somebody yesterday  I was in the car  With my daughter  And this guy  Comes up to my  Window  Knocks the window  And he's a cop  He's a weird  Even more  He's not a uniform cop  Oh shit  He's got a gun  On his belt  He's got like  His jacket on his arms  So he's an undercover cop  With a badge  And gun on his belt  Yeah  And you know  Detectives also have  A dark way about them  Yeah  And he knocks on my window  And I'm like  What the fuck  I don't know  And I roll that  And he goes  You're fucking hysterically funny 
[01:27:30]  You're fucking hilarious  And then he looks  In the back seat  And goes  Oh I'm sorry  But uh  Yeah they get annoyed  Because nobody has  Any respect for them  When they  If I'm talking  To one of my kids  People walk right  Like stand between us  Yeah  And say  Can I have a picture  With you or something  Yeah  How do you know that  I just say  No no no  No  Oh Jimmy  I used to be  Apologetically no  No  You know what  No  I'm sorry  But then I go  No  Like why would you ask me  No  I'm way meaner 
[01:28:00]  Fuck I saw Louis CK  No  No  I saw Louis CK today  What a fucking dick  Yeah let him say  A lot of people go home like that  I decided  That that's okay  That's okay with me  I decided that that's the worst case scenario  That's fucking great  God that's real fame  I met him once  Damn  He's a dick  Really why  I asked for his picture  And he didn't give it to me  Alright well  I guess he's a dick  So what was  No one ever asked  Like what was the situation  Well he was talking with his kids  Yeah  Dawn is crying  And he's putting a bandit on her knee  And I took her leg out of his hands 
[01:28:30]  And threw her across the yard  And said can I have a picture  And you know what the cocksucker said  No  No you can't have a picture  It's a dick  Yeah you never bother someone with their kids  Even I wouldn't do that  No  And you're a fucking total pest  Never  When they're eating what their kids  Yeah  I don't fault anybody for asking  It's because they want a thing  And they're fans  I'm nice of them  Yeah  Not on any level  But I don't want to do it  So I just say no  But I've had problems with girlfriends over the years  Because if we're at an appearance or something 
[01:29:00]  Where there's a lot of people that are there for us  We're going to relate to Louie right now  In a microcosm  Of an appearance we're doing  You know  We had to actually go to where the fans were  Right  Microcosm on purpose  Petri dish  Yes a petri dish  But like girlfriends would get kind of like  I mean they know that they're there to see you and shit  But they completely ignore them  They'll step with their back  And like back into them to get  That's what people do  They'll push them right out  In between you  It's very  Yeah  Disrespectful  Yep  Yeah  Well in that case you're at work 
[01:29:30]  You're literally at a job  That's true  Yeah yeah  So they should just  They should shut the fuck up  Go get a drink in a corner  And wait until you're done  Yeah  Hey bitch this is my fucking livelihood  You're dealing with  You didn't have to call her name  All right  Just tell her  Just tell her  She probably was  Stupid  I think we all  I think we all need an update on the boat  Will you be boating this summer  I need to know  So the boat  They got dug out of the pile  Yeah  It was heavily damaged  There's a lot of holes in the fiberglass  And the running 
[01:30:00]  It sat on its running gear in a parking lot  You know the running gear  The propellers  Are so very carefully honed  It's like a musical instrument  So it just sat on them  With all its weight  It's not supposed to be like that  No  So it's going to take some of the  Warm season to fix  I mean I got insurance money obviously  The boat was only a couple months old  When it happened  So it'll be restored to full strength  And then I got to sell it  Oh really  Because I got another one  Did you  You know what  Guaranteed 
[01:30:30]  It wasn't big enough  It's great  You want a bigger one  Yeah of course  You never get a smaller boat  I own two boats now  I own two boats  It's great  Yeah  You should take it out  In fucking Amity Long Island  What size  It's 42 feet  42  Yeah  And you're going to pilot this thing  That's right  Yeah  It's a big fucking boat  It's a big boat  It's a big fucking boat  It's a trawler  It's easier to manage  Because it's a trawler  So it sits in the water  It's not a  It's a displacement boat  It's not a planer  It doesn't plane up on the water 
[01:31:00]  Right  So it just  It just plows through things  Does it have a big high fly bridge  On it and everything  Yeah it's got a fly bridge  It's got a huge tank  I mean I could take this thing  Down to like  You know  Probably to Maryland somewhere  For you know  One take of gas  I could take it all the way  To an island somewhere  Yeah  It would just take a long time  It's slow  Much slower  Can you go out into the open ocean  With that  I mean the open ocean  For us land lovers  We think of it as just this one big 
[01:31:30]  But there's all kinds of  You know  Areas  And you have to  I could go to  Martha's Vineyard  Or something  I'm going to try this summer  Okay  That's that good first foray  Into like  Open water  That's right  Like cruising  That isn't  It worked out great  For fucking JFK  That's right  That's right  You're doing great  Take it around the fucking Hudson  A couple times  Take the ferry  Exactly  What's the matter with you  Maybe that's great  Is it just for pleasure boating  Or do you fish or anything  I don't fish or anything  I just really like being on it  And I  This one has more livability 
[01:32:00]  So  Yeah  I'm probably going to  Yeah  I figure that where I'll be  With the writing of the show  The first two weeks of July  I have off  So I'm going to  Take like a  Like a floating writer's retreat  And just live by myself  On the boat  And go up to river  You can take a boat  Up the Hudson River  To like the  The Great Lakes  Yeah  All the way to Canada  And it's called  The Great Circle  You know how jealous I am  That's one thing I want to do  I think Lewis and Clark  Proved that  Yeah  Yeah  Well there's like a lock system  You can go through  You get a Lake Champlain 
[01:32:30]  It's like you just discovered it  You know by the way  Exactly  It's been known since 1785  I will go  I will go up the Hudson River  It's something I want to do  Well it feels very apocalypse now  Joseph Conrad  Oh that's great  Just kind of putt putt up the river  Because it's not a thing  It's not like a treacherous ocean journey  It's just moving and then  Throw an anchor once in a while  Sleep on the boat  Chill out  The boat has you know  Full kitchen  It's very  I'm sure it's awesome  Full of all the amenities  It's got a little motorboat on it  It's got a little motorboat on it  That you can tell you  It's got us tender  Drop it in the water 
[01:33:00]  And you can go on it  Yeah  You won't be scared  Sleeping on that alone  In the middle of the fucking  What is a sea monster going to come  I don't know  A creature from the Black Lagoon  A billion bandits  A billion bandits  Fucking Somali pirates  Yeah  Who knows  There's a lot of places  They'll just tie off  And just chill out  A lot of places  Throw an anchor  Or anchors  That's so great  That sounds great  Were you always into this nautical thing  Or would you just kind of like  I also like making trouble for myself  Because I can't afford it  I cannot afford this boat  No  I bought it outright  No 
[01:33:30]  And I'm not the kind  I don't have that kind of money  That's a lot of money  To buy a boat  You have to be  You have to have  Tens of millions of dollars  In the bank  That's who my  Fellow boaters are  Yeah  The guy I'm buying it from  That I bought it from  The new one  Is like  You know  He's a retired CEO  Of several corporations  Holy fuck  And I'm buying his boat  And I'm like  I am a comic  And I had a good year  And I'm in debt  I'm in debt now  You don't buy a boat  With how much money you have 
[01:34:00]  No  It's because you can afford a boat  Yeah yeah  You don't buy a boat  When you have  As much as the boat costs twice  You buy a boat  When you have  So much fucking money  That literally  Your accountant is like  If you buy a boat  You can save a couple of bucks  On your taxes  You should be able to buy  50 of the boats  That's exactly right  Yeah  And you still have an income  That's exactly right  Yeah yeah  Fucking MC Louie  It's gonna be a fucking  The true Hollywood story  Louis CK  I'm trying to remember 
[01:34:30]  I was listening to you guys  Were cracking me up  I'm trying to remember  What it was  Damn  Fuck  You know I can only listen  I have two cars  Alright  Whatever  One to get to each boat  That's right  That's right  And this fucking  Stupid fucking company  That you work for  Yeah  Oh wow  We don't  You didn't even have to say  That we work for  We knew what you meant  Yeah  Exactly  Yeah it's like  You ever listen to  Derek and Clive  It's Dudley Moore  And Peter Cook  Oh yeah okay  So there's this one 
[01:35:00]  Where Peter Cook says  I wrote to the head  Of the BBC  I just  And I just addressed it  Cunt London  That's the greatest thing  So anyway  I have the first car  You know when you buy a car  You don't decide  What kind of radio you get  First of all  These are the same  Fucking company  It's the same company  It's a merged  Two companies  Into one company  Right  Yes  I know exactly  When you buy a car  You don't order  The radio  You get a car  That was already  In the world  I don't think 
[01:35:30]  Anybody on earth  Buys a car  And then it gets  Made at the factory  And sent to you  Unless you're gonna  Wait six months  So you buy a car  You give the dealer  Your specs  He finds an inventory  Car in the area  So it's arbitrary  It might be a serious radio  I don't know why  They're different  Why  It makes no sense  That it's two different  Kinds of radios  Alright so you get your car  And the first one I got  It's got whatever  I don't even know  What the fuck  Which one are you guys  Supposed to be on  I know  What are we  XM  We're on XM  But we're also on  The serious best  All right  So I'm on X  So I'm on the XM radio 
[01:36:00]  And then I  I want to hear Howard Stern  I can't get him  So I call  And they go  It's a  There's a  Premium package  For the Howard  You have to pay more  For Howard Stern  I'm like  But that guy  Like owns half the company  Like I don't understand  Why that makes any sense  You merged  And I tell the lady  That's ridiculous  That I would have to pay more  And that I have to  Make this phone call  Yeah  Not just the money  But that I have to  Fucking  Go through this  To get something  That's in the  Fucking thing  So she goes  Well we'll give you  A month free  Oh boy  Because you're upset 
[01:36:30]  So a month goes by  And then it goes  Shuts off  I'm like  I'm not gonna  Do this every month  So then  I buy a second car  And I get  I get the car  And it's the other one  And I have Howard Stern  And I can't listen  To Opie and Anthony  Which I listen to  Every fucking day  Oh my god  So I call them up  And I go  Why  And she goes  Because that's extra  I'm like  Wait a minute  So they're extra  I have to pay a premium  To listen to Opie and Anthony  In one car 
[01:37:00]  And a premium  To listen to Howard  In the other car  How is this not a joke  And I said to her  I own two fucking radios  Of both services  Yeah  Which means I am paying  A license fee  Already  A full license fee  For Sirius  And a full license fee  For XM  You always fucking brag  That you can move  Your subscription  From why can't you make  Why am I  I would have to pay  Two premium fees  Right  To just listen  To everything everywhere  That makes no fucking sense  None  And she said to me 
[01:37:30]  Their contracts make it  It's in their contracts  Who ours?  Yes  No  She said  The person who answers the phone  Fuck her  Said that  We want to be talking  To more people  She said it's in your contract  We're dying to be  Across the board  We're begging to be  Across the board  I know  Of course  I know that  So many more people  I know that  Yeah  We could double our audience  If they did that  And by the way  If I pay  So I said to her  So wait a minute  If I  So those guys are getting  Extra money  If I  Oh my god  So that would mean  That you guys would get 
[01:38:00]  Paid extra  If more people  Sign up for the premium  Which of course isn't true  If they're going to lie about that  I'm going to say this  Everyone that answers the phones  At the XM Sirius  Customer Service  Has molested children  Yeah  You get to say it  You get to just say it  You get to say it  What we just said  About cable  And how many ways  You can get everything  Every way  Every media company  Has to fight  To make yourself  A fucking pain in the ass  To use  Is the dumbest  Fucking thing 
[01:38:30]  Because  I don't pay either  Premium service  And as soon as  My contracts run out  On both cars  I'm not going to  Listen to Satellite anymore  I'm just not going to listen  This isn't eight channels  On the old Zenith television  No  Where I have to get up  To change it  If something's fucked up  I'll go to something else  In a second  That's exactly right  Yeah  I'll plug it in my iPod  I don't give a fuck  It should be as  You have to make it  As easy as possible  Everyone knows that  That runs a company  Let Jimmy say something  Music is good  Words of wisdom Lloyd 
[01:39:00]  Yeah music is  On an iPad  The one thing that  Fucking keeps people  Listening to this type of shit  Is live talk  Because you can't  Put that on your  Fucking iPod  And the amount of  Complaints we get  Every single day  It's really dumb  Our Twitter accounts  Get complaints all day long  How long ago  Did they merge?  Years  We've been in the building  Four years  So at least four years ago  In all those years  They couldn't  How do they expect  A customer  To understand this?  It was a revenue stream  That made sense  For a while 
[01:39:30]  Because they were getting  Extra money  But now it just  Doesn't make sense anymore  No and also  Why are they entitled  To that extra money?  If I can't  Decide which one I use  Yeah  I can't decide  It's totally up to  Somebody else  What kind of radio I get  Because they're both  Look at that  Sirius XM  Is it a Sirius radio?  No it's a Sirius XM  That's what the company is  It should be a Sirius XM radio  You have an XM radio  Oh so can I just  Wait a minute  But it's Sirius XM  What the fuck are you doing?  It's a terrible business model  It might make them  A few extra dollars  But it enrages customers  It gets everyone all confused 
[01:40:00]  And they're never going to see  How many people  They don't get  Because they're difficult  Or how many people  Actually allow their  Subscriptions to lap  For that exact  No this is what I always  Like when I was in Australia  Everybody told me  That they watched my show  And I figured  They must be getting  Old versions of it  Because it doesn't air there  But they're watching the show  Like the week before  Because the whole country  Pirates there  Here weirdos  Kind of pirate  There's not that many people  That pirate here  Yeah  But in Australia  Moms and dads pirate video  Because we're not 
[01:40:30]  Letting them buy it  Because we're keeping it  We have shows  That have been on the air  Here for like three years  And we won't even give them  If they're given the option  Like everybody in the world  Is like  Take my fucking credit card  And just let me have the thing  And I'll pay  But if you're going to be  A pain in the ass  Fuck you  I can steal all of it  So the whole country  Of Australia  Rips TV  And I learned this  So when I put my  Beacon special  One of the big important things  To me was  It was globally available  Right away  And they're happy  To buy it  Right 
[01:41:00]  So I told FX  They should sell my show  On my website  And they said  That we can't do that  Because we can't let  Other countries see it before  Oh boy  But what they're doing  All those companies  And this piece of shit  Fucking company  That we're talking on right now  Is they're keeping money out  It's a cage  It's keeping money out  It's not  It's not keeping it in  Right  They think they're keeping money in  But they're keeping it out  Yeah  By the way  What you just said  That should be a fucking infomercial  For Sirius XM  It's fucking enraging  How they don't see that  Why would they do it that way 
[01:41:30]  It makes no sense  So you know long companies  Are doing business the same way  Before you decide to put something  On your site  And do it differently  It's like nobody wants  To do anything differently  Until someone does it  And then everyone goes  Oh that's the way you do it  Imagine having to buy  A different TV for Fox News  I do  Fox, FX  No  No you gotta buy  A different TV  That gets that  And then you gotta pay a premium  The way radio and TV  Got so big  Was that there was  Nothing you had to do  Right  You didn't have to pay for it  You watch it  You didn't even know  You were paying  You're paying for it  By watching advertising  You didn't even realize  That you were paying their bills 
[01:42:00]  Your time  That you were doing them a favor  By watching the shit  The feeling was  That you just click it on  And there's all this amazing shit  Your favorite music  It's amazing  Your favorite stars  Great stories  Movies that were just out  It was amazing  It's magic  He free  It really felt that way  But now with the internet  And with all this stuff  And this shit  And this subscription shit  They're like  Well we need you to  Give us this  And you can only have this part  And then you can only do 
[01:42:30]  It's just  Well I'll get free  I'm gonna go find free  Thank you  And they're  The worst  It's absolutely right  They should make it fucking easier  And their thing as well  From a paid service  You get unlimited content  And no commercials  Okay fine  But still don't make it difficult  Once you're inside that area  You should be able  I don't have us  On my car radio  I am not listening  I don't either  That's amazing  Because my car came with  A serious radio  So I didn't want to bother  With this shit  And I could probably  Make a couple calls 
[01:43:00]  And get a VIP account  I just didn't want to  Who needs it  I just didn't want to  I'm a regular person  I'm like  This is not  You know  I don't know  I seriously  Recommend everybody  That can hear my voice  Shut off the system  That is letting you hear it  We hear this shit  Every fucking day  From our listeners  And then the listeners  That are hardcore  And they understand  That they need to pay  For the service  To keep us alive  They get so frustrated  And go look  I tried  But I'm just gonna  Like get it for free 
[01:43:30]  Somewhere  And it's offset  By the people  Who are paying  For the other one  That's the thing  That's crazy  But once I had  Two cars  I'm like  Wait a minute  But I'm  I am  I'm paying  To have both  You nailed it  Because I have  An XM radio  In my house  But there's  Serious channels  I kind of like now  And I go  Oh that's right  I can't  Listen to them  In the fucking house  And baseball and football  What the fuck  The worst is yet to come  This is so fucked up man  This is ONA's worst of 2013  So far  On the O.P. and Anthony channel  Yeah 
[01:44:00]  This is O.P. and Anthony's worst of 2013  So far  Welcome back  This is it  The worst of 2013  So far  Which means  Half of these bits  Will be played again  Around Christmas time  But never mind that  You get to enjoy them now  With me Sam Roberts  While O.P. and Anthony  Take the week off  Sometimes the greatest moments  On the show  Are the surprises  One day  We're sitting around the studio  It's commercial break  And we're not show prepping  Because we don't do that  So we're probably just  Shooting the shit about  Something that never made the air 
[01:44:30]  And Roland  The talent booker for the show  He comes in  And he goes  Hey if I can get  Roger Daltrey  From the Who  In five minutes  You guys want him?  We were like  Yes we want  Roger Daltrey  From the Who  In five minutes  If you can get him  Five minutes later  Who's walking in  To the O.P. and Anthony  Studio  Out of nowhere  We didn't see it coming  We had no clue  Roger Daltrey  Stops by  And talks about his charity  And a whole bunch  Of other stuff  But just  Being in a studio  And looking at 
[01:45:00]  Roger Daltrey  From the Who  It's an incredible experience  Now you get to hear  What it was all about  On the worst  Of 2013  So far  This is O.N.H.  Worst of 2013  So far  On the O.P. and Anthony  Channel  It's happening  We just got word  Roger  Wow  Roger Daltrey's coming in here  To say hi  Who?  Holy fuck  Grew up listening to the Who  Are you kidding me?  Even I like  Roger D  Huh?  Even I like  What?  This is really cool 
[01:45:30]  Look at Travis  Travis never gets excited  I am so excited  If we take a picture with him  Holy fuck  Let's just take pictures with him  Who cares  Can we spend our five minutes  Taking photos?  Yeah we just want  To spend our five minutes  Thumbs up  Here's Roger Daltrey  Coming in the studio  Here's a big fan of mine  There he is  Hi Roger  Mr. Daltrey  Pull up a chair  My friend  Very good  We want to thank you  For coming back  We heard you were  Leaving the building  And we  We kind of chased you down  He's a busy man  You already left right 
[01:46:00]  You're in the elevator  Ready to go  What are you up to?  Quick fill us in  I'm just here  To promote  A charity  What do you got going on?  I'm promoting  Teen Cancer America  Okay  The foundation  That we've got started  Over here  That is to help  Teenagers with cancer  Oh that's a great cause  Sure  And it's to do with  Changing your system  So that they recognize  That the ages  From 13 to 25  Are very different 
[01:46:30]  From children  And they're very different  From adults  Right  Especially  Yeah  Do you think  That they're not  Screened early enough?  Teenagers tend to suffer  From very rare cancers  Some of the rarest  They also suffer  Problematically more  Late diagnosis  Because they're playing sports  And things like that  They also  They get aggressive cancer  Cancer becomes more aggressive  In them  Because they're growing  So fast  So all in all 
[01:47:00]  They suffer  Quite  They've got  A disproportionate  Problem rate  With teenagers  Right  And the trouble  With the system  At the moment  Is that  Most of the hospitals  With their  Adolescent  And young adult  Programs  They go from  They go from the age  Of 13 to 40  And of course  A 13 year old  And a 40 year old  Have got nothing  In common  Whatsoever  But we've found  In England  Where we've been  Doing this for 23 years  We've built 
[01:47:30]  25 hospital wards  We've got another  10 being built  At the moment  The evidence  We've got  By isolating  The group  You can  Refine the medicine  That they get  Right  So you get  Bigger success rates  In the treatments  Did somebody  Did something inspire you  To get involved with this  Like was there something  In your life  That was affected by it  And you said  This is something  We have to do more for  Well it was my doctor  That started it  And I just  It kind of made  Perfect sense to me  Because it's 
[01:48:00]  Nothing to do with drugs  Even though  The end result  Will be to do  With how they use the drugs  This is to do  With providing care  Providing  Specialist  Carers  Psychological support  Parental support  And environment  Because you  You know  They think it's right  That children should  Have teddy bears in hospitals  You going into a hospital  And finding something  That's teenage friendly  Right  You'll have to hunt  To find it  Yeah  So we just want  To change that thinking  And we want to 
[01:48:30]  We want to make  Teen Cancer America  The gold standard  So that  Because every state  Is very very different  In the way they  They work  By adopting that  Gold standard  As a program  They can't hide  If they're negating  Their duty  Of supplying  Specialist treatment  For this specific age group  Well do you think  That makes sense to you  Yeah  Of course  No it does  Absolutely does  Screenings happen  When you're a certain age  Like you want to get checked  For prostate cancer  For prostate cancer  Or whatever it is 
[01:49:00]  You have to be a certain age  For that to happen  No no no  Screening isn't a problem  But like I say  Jimmy  Oh no I'm making sure  Lots of issues  Where boys have gone in  And they've got a pain  In their knee  And they say  Oh you've been playing football  Yeah of course they have  Yeah of course they have  They'll come back  In three weeks  And they come back  In three weeks  And they give them  Some anti-inflammatories  Or whatever  And it hasn't gone away  Of course  And they give them  Some more anti-inflammatories  And they go back  In six weeks  And of course  The guy's in agony  And it can turn out 
[01:49:30]  To be a bone cancer  Where they have to  Roger I was a little  Hypochondriac as a kid  I always thought  It was the worst thing ever  Oh my knee hurts  It's got to be bone cancer  That's what I always thought  I was a terrible kid  Always crying  Like I say  This will change  This hopefully will change it  And we've got  We've got  We've got one unit  Out in UCLA  Which was the first unit  There's a hospital  In Seattle  That came to our  Yearly conference 
[01:50:00]  Three years ago  In Britain  And they've copied  What we do in Britain  And they're going to  I think they're going to  Adopt our standard  Yale are doing  An outpatients  Chopped down in Philadelphia  So it's  It's taking off  People are getting it  And the parents  Are getting it  Because there's nothing worse  Than being a teenager  Where you're just  Coming into those times  Where yeah  You can get laid  Oh man right  You know  You've got all the things  Teenagers do  And you get wham  With this one  Who doesn't appreciate 
[01:50:30]  A good teen  Right  Right  Well I didn't mean  Like that Roger  I just mean you know  They bring a certain  Joy to the world  Right  Certain youthful exuberance  Right  Finally have fun  Exactly  And then they're stuck  And to stick them  In isolation  Which is what's been  Happening  It can have  You know  Serious  Is there any way  We can get involved  Or  Yeah  Just look up  TeenCancerAmerica  Okay  Dot org  And donate  And donate  And donate  And motivate 
[01:51:00]  The hospitals  The cancer hospitals  Right  In your states  And area  To look at what we're doing  Come and talk to us  How long have you been involved  In the states  I've been banging on doors  For ten years  And two years ago  I got lucky  With the head of UCLA  David Feinberg  Who completely understood it  Like I did  When I was first told  Of what they were  Trying to do  Just a bell went off  In my head  That this  Made such sense 
[01:51:30]  Because most medicine  Is hugely hugely expensive  Relatively  This is really cheap  This is just organisation  Right  Right  Yeah  Yeah  But the benefits  Are huge  So that's what went off  In my head  And I just got lucky  I met David  And told him  What we were trying to do  And he got it  Immediately got it  He sent the team  Over to Britain  They looked at what  We were doing  Came back  And said  We've got to have it  Was David a Who fan?  I don't know  Whether he's a Who fan 
[01:52:00]  Really?  I actually never asked him that  I mean obviously  I bet she's a Who fan  You have your top priority  Of this charity  Which is fantastic  But he had to have been like  God damn  Who's next  I played that thing  Until you know  I wore it out  But Dave Grohl  And Robert Plant  And me  We did a  Who?  A benefit  You know  Robert Plant  Oh that guy  My mate  My mate Percy  We did a benefit  In someone's back garden  In Hollywood  They raised two million dollars  Paid for the unit 
[01:52:30]  In UCLA  Yeah  And that's how we got the foot  Did you sing with Robert Plant?  I didn't do any  No I'd love to do an album  With Robert Plant  I'm going to  That would be huge  I'm going to call him in a minute  You should  I'm going to get the phone out now  Because you reminded me  You know what  You two have great heads of hair  Yeah  You two have the best heads of hair  I've ever seen in rock and roll  The sugar in the sand  Unbelievable  So do you  It's got to be nice though  In your position  Where you know  That people listen  When you talk  Because when you use  All the years of fame 
[01:53:00]  To get something really good done  That's got to be a nice feeling  I of course wouldn't know  For either of those reasons  But I hear it's got to be nice  Well you know  What else do you do  When you're not singing  It gives me another motivation  In my life  I mean  For the last sort of  Fourteen years  I've run  A whole week  Of concerts  At the Royal Albert Hall  In London  Which has been supported  By most of the British  Pop bands  Right  Like last year  We had Paul McCartney  For instance  And who had done it  Several times  More people have done it  Than not done it  Right  We do a whole week 
[01:53:30]  Seven nights of charity  A week  Which is our biggest fundraiser  And again  It gives you a purpose outside  And the music business is great  It's really  But it's not 24-7  Right  Yeah  There's an awful lot of down time  What the hell else do you do  Yeah  Did you get to a point  Where you get so successful  Where you're like  I just want to do something  Not else  But something good  With all this  Because you're on top of the world  And it's like  Okay  How do I give something to people  No I basically saw  I saw the link 
[01:54:00]  That without  The support of teenagers  When we were  You know  In the 60s  None of this would have happened  The rock business  Wouldn't be there  Without teenagers supporting it  Right  Yeah  I thought  Well this is a perfect  Way to give back  Vehicle  To get the music business  To support  Which they did  And the comedy business  In England  And it just took off  And by the end of next year  We're hoping to  That every teenager  That gets cancer  In Britain  Has access to  One of our facilities 
[01:54:30]  And what's the  What's the website  And stuff that people  Can go to  Is it teencancer  Teencanceramerica.org  Okay  I think it's the org  We've got to get him out of here  This was very nice  Thanks for popping in  Yeah we're good to see you  Enlightening people  I'm sorry I haven't got more time  No that's okay  No it's all good man  Thank you for giving me  We're obviously all huge fans  It's not one of those things  That many people want to talk about  Right  Exactly  But I've got to tell you one thing  Of all the  All the teens I've met  And some  Survive and  A lot don't  Sadly  A lot don't 
[01:55:00]  Not one of them  Have ever  Ever got me down  They are  Truly magnificent  And the courage  Is amazing  Yeah  Now watching  And seeing  The fear  And the terror  In the eyes of the parents  That destroys me  But the teenagers  Are fabulous  So I try and talk about it  With enthusiasm  Because I know they do  And they support it  With enthusiasm  And they never get down  Right  Right  Right  All the way  All the way down  Yeah  Excellent 
[01:55:30]  Very cool  Roger Daltrey everyone  Be right back  Thanks man  All right guys  Oh yeah  Yeah  This is hilariously bad  More of Opie and Anthony's  Wars of 2013  So far  So far  Coming up  Six months worth of shows  More than 500 hours  Trimmed down to just one week  Of essential listening  What's that?  That's 20 hours of  Mind-blowing radio 
[01:56:00]  Translation  We wasted well over 450 hours  Of your time already this year  Sorry  This is Opie and Anthony's  Worst of 2013  So far  Today's a theme day  What do you mean  It's a theme day?  Eric has created a theme for today  I don't know  That's what I was talking about  Eric did you create a theme today?  What a bunch of surprises today  Yeah Roland and I created a theme  Roland?  For real?  Yeah it was mime  And then Roland jumped in on it too  So it's both of us now  When are we going to find out about this? 
[01:56:30]  When do we get to eat it?  Sure it's food related  Well I was waiting for Roland to show up  We're like  We  We're the ones that are surprised  We're surprised now  Our names are on the wall  It's a Friday  We figured we'd surprise you  What kind of theme though?  Some kind of Irish theme?  I guess we could apply it to that  I hate corned beef  So don't fuck  Yeah  I want Irish music all day long today  So that we're doing  Alright  We're doing fucking Irish  Yeah 
[01:57:00]  When Irish boys are simbailing  It's D&D day  Roland has just joined us  I would bring you guys gourmet donuts  But your palate sucks  I brought you the worst donuts ever  I was expecting Dunkin Donuts  But you brought this gourmet shit  And then E-Rock ran away  Because  It's not just Dunkin Donuts day  E-Rock  E-Rock  This is an E-Rock day  Okay  Scott and Todd was not the big thing 
[01:57:30]  That he was planning for  For today  All week long  He's been planning for something  And what is it?  He's gonna present  It's not Dunkin Donuts day  Oh no  Oh no  What is Dunkin Donuts?  I don't know  E-Rock tell him  It's not Dunkin Donuts day  He just walked back in the studio  He's hiding something  What day is it?  Oh no  Today  Is  Tequila and Donut Day  What the fuck is going on here?  Tequila and Donuts?  There's two bottles of Patron  One is silver  And one is cafe  What is he doing? 
[01:58:00]  What is he doing?  Travis  What the fuck is going on?  Wow  Like Sam said  Eric  Had an idea  Yeah  And here's his idea  And the next time you shit on anyone  You see what happens  When you give Sal and E-Rock  The first segment  Holy shit  We did set up for this  By giving Sal and E-Rock  The first segment  You're not missing anything  And of course Sam is crying  Because Sam and I 
[01:58:30]  Have been so excited for this  Why?  Because you knew  It would be a bust-a-roo?  Now do you realize  Tequila and Donuts  Don't really go together  Right?  Well it wasn't supposed to be  Tequila and Donut Day  To start  Yeah  But Roland decided to  Add on the Donuts to it  It was just going to be  Tequila Day  Tequila  How do you have a tequila day?  It's 7 in the morning  How do you not?  It's 7 in the morning  Alright let's see you do a shot of tequila  Who's going to do a shot?  Well E-Rock's going to do more  Tequila Day 
[01:59:00]  I swear to you  I don't even give a fuck  If this is bombing out there  This is the weirdest fucking morning  In a while  Holy shit  That's why you gotta just keep rolling with it  It might be bombing at a moment  The Sal story should have been amazing  It wasn't  Because he didn't stick around  To get all the details  And E-Rock presents us  With something he worked on  For I think it is  Close to 15 hours  He just doesn't want to admit it anymore  It's in here  And Ant gave him a D on that  And then  And then he walks in with  Fucking tequila  And Roland walks in with donuts 
[01:59:30]  Well I figure  You're going to eat these  Because it's breakfast  Well why?  Because it's breakfast  Why are most of the donuts  They got the holes in the middle man  You want to fill that shit in  Don't you?  Because  There's jelly right there  When you ask them  To pick 12 donuts  They get very angry  Yeah because they  Want to get rid of the ones  That don't sell well  That's why you never tell them  No  I told the guy  I wanted to pick  And he screamed at me  I know he called me  Some asshole or something  Oh really?  Yeah  Did he go  No I told him 
[02:00:00]  Your donuts are not that great  Just let me pick  Wow  But he don't care  He's just a worker  You don't give a fuck  If you're trashing your donuts  They're not great  They're pretty good  God damn donuts  Which one you got there?  I got like an apple fill  Ooh  Pretty god damn good  Do your shot of tequila  You rock  I gotta get cups  Oh god  And then we got  Scott and Todd audio  Sam's crying  Tequila at 7 in the morning 
[02:00:30]  You rock's going to do a shot  You rock's going to do a shot of tequila  You think Eric's just bringing us into his life  Like he just drinks tequila  And listens to Scott and Todd  And eats donuts  And listens to Scott and Todd  It makes no fucking sense at all  The whole hour didn't make sense  I know  It's going to be one of the worst hours we've ever done  I told you  I like bizarre  And that includes  It includes a balloon guy  Oh wow  Holy fuck  It could be  We're all excited for it 
[02:01:00]  Later on  But not now  That was a good donut  Alright so  E-Rock has opened up the  The Patron  He's just thrown in a coffee cup  Down the hatch  Down the hatch  Here he goes  E-Rock  Salud  And he just did a shot of tequila  This is like  So stupid and weird 
[02:01:30]  And  Wow  It's tequila and  Donut day  E-Rock just did a shot of tequila  At 7.15  Will you be doing another shot?  Oh yeah  Yeah  Throughout the show  Oh boy  Okay this could get interesting  Yes  And  When  When do you  Start up Roland?  Roland's waiting for 8  At night time  I'm moving  At night time  I gotta move  You're moving? 
[02:02:00]  Yeah  Where are you going?  I'll tell you  During commercial break  Right now  Why are you moving?  I thought you liked where you were  I do love it  Are you going to stay in the area?  Mm-mm  Coming back to Manhattan?  Yeah  Wow  Oh really?  Yeah  I think  That's good for you  Yeah  You're a little isolated out there  Roland  Even though you're  You're leaving Long Island City  Skyline pictures were terrific  Terrific  Oh good  We'll get different fucking  We'll get different pictures from Roland  Right  To the other side  Well I don't know if the listeners  Could handle it too much more 
[02:02:30]  So we should probably break  Before we do the Scott and Todd audio  Holy shit  That E-Rock worked on  He put a bottle away  He's got two different kinds of tequila  In case you guys want to  Why are you crying?  It's just  So bizarre  It's just the craziest shit ever  And there goes the donut  But I'll tell you why  It's bizarre  Like E-Rock  E-Rock's all in  Yeah he is  He came up with this concept  Oh we're going to do tequila and donut day  And it's going to be a huge hit  And I think he really believes  We're all just going to sit around  Drinking tequila together 
[02:03:00]  And in the end  He's going to be the only one  Of course he is  Yeah yeah yeah  That's what makes you laugh right  Of course  Because he has no awareness  That it's not going to work  Because if anybody  Has any doubts  I'll  I'll  Sweep them away right now  Matt loves a good drink  He's not drinking tequila  I can pretty much guarantee that  I am doing a shot of tequila  I can pretty much guarantee  While the sun is still  In the sky  Right  And you know what was great  This whole thing started 
[02:03:30]  Like he got this idea  Yeah  When you guys were talking about tequila  And you guys said  You didn't even like tequila that much  Yeah I'm not a huge fan  I'll have a shot here and there  But he rocks the man  He loves tequila  He's like we're doing tequila day bro  I was like yes  And then he did it  He brought in tequila  He's the man  Chavis you going to do a shot of tequila today  No  Roland maybe a little later  But it's tequila day  Roland might be the only one  That maybe later  Maybe Troy would like some  Troy would  He's down for it  Troy's not here yet  So now you've got to find people  To drink tequila with 
[02:04:00]  That's your job  Sal you going to have a shot of tequila  I'm at work right now  I'm not getting  Someone bringing up the whole work thing  Yeah  Of course Sal would be the one  Eric's got a breakfast tequila  Yeah  Breakfast tequila  It's a breakfast tequila  It's tequila and donuts  There's coffee in the other one  Right that's what I mean  Oh yeah yeah  That's fine then  That counts  He brought in coffee and tequila  But he's having some of the Patron silver  Be honest with you Rocky  You had no doubt in your mind  That people would drink tequila with you  Please be honest 
[02:04:30]  You want me to be honest  I thought it would just be a way  So I could drink tequila  While we're doing the show  No  Is that true  That's why I bought enough for everybody  Yeah but that's my question  I don't even like the coffee one  No that's what I'm saying  Spread it around  Do you really believe  Everyone would like  Be all in and start drinking tequila  Take it to the offices upstairs  See who wants a shot  Maybe they want to join in on tequila and donut day  It's fucking crazy  It makes no sense 
[02:05:00]  No  Sure  Maybe Scott Greenstein wants a swig  Yeah why don't we go down the wall  Maybe he wants to take a belt  Yeah just walk around with one hand with your Patron  The other hand with all the donuts  Wait a minute  You could be the shot girl  Donut?  Tequila?  Donut?  A lot of people saying on Twitter  I just quick quickly  Check quickly  Excuse me  They're saying at least it's not gay  Well that's true 
[02:05:30]  You're right  It depends on how much Eric drinks  Eric you want to do another shot before we go to break or?  Do another shot real quick  One more  It's tequila and donut day  Yeah make it happen  I think every time you have a donut  You gotta have a shot of tequila  Right let's start  Can you tell us about the movie now?  And  This is  What movie?  This is your segment right?  Your movie  You came up with tequila and donut day?  I came up with tequila  Alright  You just had the donut  Okay  But you came up  Okay so you came up with tequila day  Yeah  You gotta fucking have confidence in your segment  Yeah  You can't all of a sudden go like 
[02:06:00]  Nah I won't do a shot  It's fucking tequila and donut day now  It's your bit  Let's go  One more  It's already got a higher grade in my book than your Scott and Todd day  You're already  What do you give tequila and donut day?  Right now  It's getting a fucking  A good B  A good B  Wow  A solid B or  A solid B  Are we talking B plus?  It's teetering on B plus  This could definitely go to A  Before the end of the show  I'll tell you that much  Plus if he rocks drunk on the air by the end of the show  It's a fucking A plus plus plus plus plus 
[02:06:30]  It's A plus  Yes  Can you get the word out to Nicole from the morning mashup?  Oh shit  I think she might enjoy a shot of tequila  You probably don't have to tell her  Open the bottle one more time  She'll smell it  Come over here like a bloodhound  It's 7.20  She may not be here yet  When do they start?  Seven  Oh my god  That's pretty nice  And how many hours they do?  Three  They do three and they got 18 people that are on the air  Jesus  Noodles all over me  Why are we the only ones that do four hours? 
[02:07:00]  I don't know  I think  Don't they do like a couple hours and then they rerun it immediately after?  From 10 to 11 they rerun the first hour  Yeah  Oh my god  That's great  We should do that  Good for them  Rerun this hour?  Well maybe not this hour  Oh boy  Maybe not this hour  This might be one of those one and dones  Oh boy  Got a few of those out there  A little tequila burp there?  Yeah  Hopefully you're listening live  Because you're not going to ever hear this hour again  Unless Iraq starts puking from too much tequila  Oh boy  So the lesson we learned today is don't try 
[02:07:30]  No, no, no  Not necessarily  You could try  Have you done the second shot, Iraq?  You need to work on your awareness  Have you done the second shot?  Yes, Sam  Well  Because  You know it is tequila day  So part of that is a party, you know?  Yeah  Yeah  So I opened the invitation up to the mashup  Okay  Rich said  Tequila day  Perhaps after my egg sandwich  Okay  Let's do some logic there 
[02:08:00]  And Nicole  Yeah  Who we all know  Likes to party every now and then  Oh yeah  Said  That's fucking disgusting  That's really weird  Her feet  She'll be here in 20 minutes  Oh I thought she was talking about her toes  Oh  So no takers just yet  Wow  So far no takers with the tequila, Iraq  Just you  Iraq I'm sure other people will come on board  You know  Maybe by 8 a.m.  Yeah  Yeah  Other people will come around  Still early  And I just realized  I mean I know  You know  He gets made fun of every now and then 
[02:08:30]  But he's still a part of the team  I think it's like  The fact that  Gary hasn't been offered  A shot of tequila  Is like a little  Come on  That is disrespectful  Yeah you gotta make sure you offer him  Whenever he arrives  Yeah  Around 9 o'clock maybe  He'll be here  I don't know what time he gets here  Did you  Did you float this by management?  Hey we got a segment we want to do  Tequila Friday  Oh  So this didn't get approved  Are you gonna try to expense the tequila?  No  Look  He committed 
[02:09:00]  As far as I'm concerned  10 points for Iraq  10 points  Yeah  Yeah  How about you do your second shot  Do your second shot before break  And then we'll break  We'll continue with tequila  And donuts  Donuts  Friday  Wow  Well  There it goes  And we continue with Scott and Todd audio  That he worked on as well  There it goes  Oh my god  Oh he felt that one  How's that  It's good  You feeling it yet?  Not yet  Feeling a little  Did you have a little warmth feeling though? 
[02:09:30]  A little warm feeling?  No but give it a little bit more  Probably  Better have another donut too  Yeah  Maybe  Maybe a glaze or sugar  To kind of balance it  Because chocolate's too much  Good idea  Chocolate and tequila doesn't work  Too well  I shit myself  I'm not going to lie  I had a piece of cake  A chocolate cake  And drank a lot of tequila  Left a bar and exploded in my ass  That was bad days  Yeah  That's a bad day right there 
[02:10:00]  She goes  Where are you going?  I shit myself  And I left  Show started out a little weird today  I was thinking uh oh  But I think we're turning this thing around  Yeah  I think we're turning this thing around a little bit  I think maybe during the break  Since he  Since the  At it's core tequila day is a celebration  Uh huh  Sure  E-Rock should spend some time  Trying to find some people that will  That's exactly right  Take some tequila shots  Yeah  I don't drink  I would do it  He needs a drinking buddy  Yeah let's find some more people  To do tequila with E-Rock  Well this segment almost made me forget  How shitty Sal's story was  Lack of pictures and 
[02:10:30]  E-Rock saved the day  He really did  Yeah I think you saved the day again E-Rock  Good one  Alright  Alright  We got Rich Voss coming in a little later  Yeah  Oh yeah  He's playing uh  Maguire's out there on Long Island  So we got him coming in  I think Joe Curry's about  Another hour or so  That night  And we got the Scott and Todd audio  And  And more tequila shots  And more tequila shots  For E-Rock  Excuse me  You feeling it yet? 
[02:11:00]  Tequila burps at fucking 7.30  You feeling it a little bit?  No it'll be  It'll happen soon  He's feeling it  The second you do a shot  Of tequila  You get that warm  Kind of  But I had a donut right after  So it might take a little  It's about time we got Eric  Nice and loosened up on this show  A little bit  Oh god  We might see a new E-Rock today  Oh god  Oh god  I can only imagine  Oh yeah  Alright we'll break here  More tequila  More donuts  And more stuff  Oh yeah  Yeah 
[02:11:30]  It gets worse  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013  So far  Coming up  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013  So far  Continues  Right now  Right now  Right now  It's uh  Tequila and donut day  Tequila and donut day  How you feeling E-Rock?  It's starting to take effect  And I heard you found someone  To do a shot of tequila  For tequila and donut day  Nice  I found a few people 
[02:12:00]  A few people  One will do it right now  A couple will come during their breaks  Really?  Wow  Who are these people?  Are we allowed to say?  Uh  The first person  I don't actually know what he does here  But his name is Dennis  He sits outside our office  Oh Dennis is the one that drives me nuts  About the Islanders  Every single day  Found out I was an Islanders fan  So  I'll go get him  We have a little chit chat  In the bathroom every morning  About the Islanders  Every time I see him  The Islanders  Well  I'm not in as much  This year 
[02:12:30]  And of course  They're doing okay  Let me fill you in  On something  Also  When baseball season  Kicks in  He does the same to you  With baseball  It's the Yankees  Oh so maybe  Oh it's all about the Yankees  Oh boy  Yankees Yankees  I thought he was just a hockey fan  That's a little strange  So he's going to do a shot  I was breaking down  The tequila thing  With Anthony  E-Rock  You know what though  I might be wrong  Because people are now  Coming to the table  To get their shots  To tequila  There he is  What's up Dennis  Slobo  How are you  Thanks  He's calling E-Rock 
[02:13:00]  Slobo  You picked up on the nickname  Huh Dennis  Yes  You like that one  Slobo  It's fitting  It's Roland's favorite  Roland loves that nickname  For E-Rock  You going to do a shot  To tequila  Sure why not  Yeah why not  I'll celebrate  The Islanders win last night  Oh there you go  I told you  Islanders  Islanders  Do they have a good team  This year  No the rich  D.P.H.O. is down  In the minor leagues  He's doing  Some minor league stuff now  Yeah that makes our team better

[02:14:30]  Silver Patrol  This is very nice  It is  Did you have her  I have her  Dennis what do you do here  I know you  Oh that's a good question  I know we've had a lot  Of conversations about  The Islanders over  The last few years  I work in the music department  The oldies channels  I program some of the music  Oh  Oh really  Once in a while  I DJ on the channels  Whoa  Well I hear it in your voice  Dennis  Wow  Anything with Cousin Brucey  Yeah  I work with Cousins sometimes  You do work with the Couss  Yeah  I used to work with him  Back at CBS FM  CBS FM  Wow  Did you know Ron Lundy

[02:15:30]  In New York years ago  Ted Brown  And every I think  Memorial Day  He used to get drunk  On the air  As like a doctor  Would come in  And each time  And we did that  At a radio station  I worked with  But the DJ  Didn't like alcohol  So he drank like  Whiskey Sours  And all he did  Was get nauseous  By the end of the day  Yeah Whiskey Sours  You can't drink  Oh what to show  Like how drunk  You can get  Before the big  Memorial Day weekend  They give you  The breathalyzer  Yeah normally  These things are done  On just the supervision  Of like a police officer  With a breathalyzer 
[02:16:00]  It says a lot  That answer  I can do a shot  To kill  It's too early  It's too fucking early  Eight o'clock comes soon  Oh god  There's no way  Nine o'clock  No way  I am going to do a shot  In the morning  You drove in  I just can't  You drove in  Well I have to drive home  I didn't know  If you were staying  In the city or not  Oh boy he's slurring  I like it  He started  A little slur  He went  It's a little  It's very slight  Only us drunks  Can really pick up on it  But he said  He goes  Like the S 
[02:16:30]  The S  He said I didn't know  If you were staying  In the city or not  I didn't know  If you were staying  He's trying very hard  You can see  He's trying very hard  To keep his enunciation  And you know what's starting  To pipe through a little bit  Some of that E-Rock confidence  Liquid courage  Liquid courage  Yes  Why didn't you buy  The coffee tequila Patron  Oh boy  Because actually  People really do like  I don't care for it  But a lot of people  Like that better  Than the silver Patron  Silver Patron

[02:29:00]  Why do you keep coming around  Got a few people really questioning E-Rock  Really  This guy Joe in North Carolina  There's got to be something behind Eric Drake and Patron this early  Ah  Is there something else going on with you E-Rock  Could be  No  This is just based off the conversation we had earlier in the week about tequila  Alright you coming in for the Scott and Todd audio that you brought to the show  You want me to  Sure  I certainly do  And we'll celebrate the Scott and Todd while he's in here 
[02:29:30]  He's three shots in right  Shot of tequila  Three shots in is a good fucking buzz don't you think  Um you're feeling it  That's a pretty good buzz  But you gotta watch when he's pouring too  I think he's going light with the shots  No he's not look at the bottle  I've been watching the bottle  Oh  Maybe I'm wrong then  This is a good pretty decent hit taken out of that bottle already  And also you gotta realize the weight to liquor ratio there  Sure  Somebody who's a little more rotund can drink a little more than someone who's a little 
[02:30:00]  More of a slight frame  That's a polite fat joke  No  No it's actually just like fat but that's okay  Alright so  E-Rock why not just pour another shot  And uh  There's no one else in here  What?  Well you gotta still keep it going  It's your fucking bitch  It's tequila Friday  Let it rip  Do you want another donut too? 
[02:30:30]  Nah I'm gonna rip  Oh  He doesn't like sweets  We've learned that over the years  There ain't nothing I could do about it  You know I need your love  Jesus  You really think he's fucking nursing it Sam?  No I know  Are you kidding me?

[02:32:00]  When he first went over there  Really?  Playing the long versions of songs  That was the selling point  Yeah that was it  That's fantastic  Ellie Dilling came in and did mornings  Remember that?  No  She replaced Alice  I remember the Nightbird, Alice in Steel  When she was on any WFM  That was uh  Wait who was the guy that replaced Imas  And he was known for what?  Ellie Dillon  Who I believe was dating Bob Pittman  Wow  He knows all this dirt  Right  All the radio dirt  All they used to call us Radio Rats  Radio Rats  Radio Rats

Yeah  It doesn't fucking matter  When I went to radio  They'll give you the show  And you know, a lot of the British Invasion music  Has its roots in the R&B music of the 50s  Wow, yeah, yeah, yeah  Good stuff in there  The crickets don't even care  Buddy Holly and the crickets?

It was a little abrupt though  I hit it right there  He did hit it  You know what I used to say  I'd say, hey Mrs. Brown  You've got a lovely daughter  And you're not so bad yourself  What you could do in the oldies radio field  You'd have those good lines on index cards  And you'd rotate them  And you would just rotate them 
[02:38:00]  Did you ever do the one  They ain't, wait  They ain't related, but they do be brothers  That's a good one  That was a big one too  Write that one down  They ain't related, but they do be brothers  You remember that?  Or I got an index card with that on it  I actually did that one  I'm embarrassed to say I did that one  You know, it's a good one  That I heard on an air check  From a guy out at KING in Seattle  He was playing Love on a Two-Way Street  By the moments  Of course  He said, I've got Love on a Two-Way Street  But that don't mean that I go both ways 
[02:38:30]  Whoa!  Gay bashing joke  I love it  A little homophobic  I thought that was a little blues  So I didn't want to do that  Hey, Love on a Two-Way Street  But my asshole's one way  Eagle  You missed what you said  What happened?  He goes, I don't do that  I was a little blue  A little blue  A little blue  A little blue  Yeah, that was left to like  The overnight guys, right?  Talking about dicks  We always made sure  That the overnight guys  Cleaned the cart machines  That was their job?  Clean the cart machines  And emptied the coffee pots  All right

The go-to lines  Hey, the weekend's here  Hey, thank God for Friday  TGIF  Hey, thank God it's Friday

He's great  I love this  The cliches  Denny  Denny  Fucking Dennis  Is fantastic  With this radio history  But the thing on Friday  Is you don't want to talk about Monday  Because you don't want people  To get down  People want to enjoy the weekend  No  They're feeling up on Friday  So don't mention Monday  Don't mention Monday 
[02:40:00]  But what do you mention on Mondays?  You mention Monday  3 o'clock  On Sunday afternoon  Because then people  Start putting themselves  Into a Monday  Point of view  Yeah  Research has shown  Sunday at 3 p.m.  Is when people start  Thinking about Monday  Yeah  3 o'clock  You start going like  Ah, tomorrow's work  What do you do on Monday  To get them through?  Because now they're like  Ah, fuck, it's Monday  Wednesday  Think of Wednesday  Get over the hump day  Don't forget  Wednesday we'll be giving away  Concert tickets  Oh, so there's something  To look forward to  What do you do on Monday?

It's horrible  Is it terrible? 
[02:41:00]  Why is it horrible?  Why is it worse?  Because it's so early  It's early, yeah, yeah  E-Rock felt that one  How many is E-Rock on?  I think it's four  E-Rock's eyes are all glassy now  Four impressive shots though  Yeah  Impressive  Yeah  Look at the bottle  We should go to the diner after this  For real cheese, hash browns  And some home fries, right?  That's right  Hash fries and gravy  All-American radio kind of breakfast  Right, Dan  That's good, Dan  Thank you  And you know what a good thing is?  When you go to a restaurant  You'd call up  You'd tell the waitress  You work at the radio station  And you'd call back 
[02:41:30]  And you'd say  Oh, give a shout out  I'm down here at, you know  So-and-so  The Starlight Diner  Hey, you'll like this one, Danny  You know what Scorch used to do to waitresses?  Oh  A waitress would be like  Pop him in the ass  Meanwhile, he'd try  The waitress would go  Hey, aren't you on the radio?  Well, yes  And then Scorch would say  No, I'm right here  Ah, see  Scorch  Give me a bell  You can have that one, Danny  Oh, yeah  Danny, you take that  Enjoy that line, okay?  Yeah  There goes Danny  It means something else here, though  All right, Dan, thanks 
[02:42:00]  Where'd Iroh go?  I thought we were going to do some  He is a little piece of radio history right there  Oh, my gosh  Oh, God, it's so funny  That's a little blue  But it doesn't mean I go both ways  Holy shit  I swear I don't know what's going on  It's amazing  It's tequila day  Tequila and donut day  It's tequila and donut day  That's all you need to know  Where'd Iroh go to?  I don't know  Iroh  Oh, shit, where is he?  Sal doesn't know where he is today  He's MIA  He just wandered off  He just walked off  Toward the bathroom? 
[02:42:30]  Uh-oh  Oh, boy, he might have the donut shots  Someone's going there  He might be puking, maybe  Sal's going to look  Maybe that last shot has him  With the donuts and the shot  He looked fucked up after the last one  Dude, his eyes were tearing up  I know, it's Iroh  But he hasn't eaten yet, really?  He's only had the two donuts  He hasn't grazed yet  Really start grazing  Yeah, yeah  Danny's a trip  He is  You know what?  I've never said more than two words to the guy  Or heard him  He's usually like  Hey, you catch the game last night?  I'm like, yeah  Fucking, you know  Oh, Yankees  He's one of the nicer guys around here 
[02:43:00]  Yeah  But to hear him  I didn't know he was very involved  With the music stations  I do  That's why when we came to New York  So many people hated us  Especially in the business  Because we weren't following the mold of the radio guy  No  And they also knew if we were successful  A lot of those guys would have to go  Exactly  Did you rock?  Where did you run off to?  I had to pay  Oh, did you?  Is it the tequila?  Well, I didn't get to go last break, so  What?  All right  How do you feel?  I mean, is Tequila Donut Day doing well? 
[02:43:30]  It's doing well  I really thought it was going to be a bust  You know what?  I thought it was going to be a complete bust  Right  And Dennis to come in  It's just been  Who's next?  It's a party  I'm going to go find some more people  Find some more people  Are you feeling it?  I'm feeling it  You are a little bit  In what way?  I'm very hot  Oh, you're very  Yeah, look at his face  It's all red  You're a little flusher  Take off your hoodie  A little red  You got your shirt, dude  It's Tequila Friday  Whatever  I let your hair down  Nice  Take your pants off  It's all good 
[02:44:00]  It's all good  We got to film something in the elevator today  Oh, E-Rock  Drunk E-Rock Elevator Show  We'll figure something out  I need a new show for next week  Yeah  I went with an old show yesterday  Because I was too busy with all the shit  Never  But we'll have a brand new episode next week  Travis, how do you feel?  I'm fine  Travis?  You're not going to get fired  You had nothing else to do with this  Tequila or Donut  I'm not going to get fired  Eric's a senior producer  I'm a producer  Oh, she  Oh, she  Nobody's going to get fired on a Tequila Friday  Get out of here 
[02:44:30]  This is two hours of content  It's a party  Sanctioned by E-Rock  I swear I don't even know if this is good  It's good  Oh, I love it  It's so weird  I thought Dennis had a great first appearance  You know what?  Dennis rules  You're right  That was Dennis' first appearance on the program  And I think he nailed it  Yeah  He nailed it  He's talking those songs up  He's adding in the little tidbits of information about the music  Eric is sweating, by the way  Yeah  E-Rock, are you sweating?  I'm hot  Yeah, your cheeks are all red  And, uh, yeah  It's just strange because it's not that warm in here 
[02:45:00]  No, no  I turn the air conditioner around  Yeah, it's pretty good today  Yeah  All right  Yeah  This is great  This is a good Friday show  I feel sorry for, uh, Denny  Why is that?  I know a lot of guys  I mean, radio is a tough fucking road  It is  Really tough fucking road  Yes, it is  And I was, uh  I was making no money when I started out in radio  And I did the mobile DJing thing  I fucking hated it  I had to do, I had to do two in a night sometimes  Oh, man  I did at least two a weekend minimum  But sometimes it was like four in a weekend 
[02:45:30]  I had to, like, go to this guy's house  He had a garage  And he would set up all the DJ equipment  And my name would be on it  Like, all right, this is yours  I had to pile it into my little Honda Accord  This brings back memories  And I could barely see as I'm driving down the road  Because I have so much shit  Oh, man  And then I have to go to the gig and set it up  And I'm, I was never that good at that  So I was always stressed trying to figure it out  With the portable speakers and everything  And then, like, half the people didn't even give a fuck  You were there  The bar was trying something new 
[02:46:00]  And all of a sudden you had to awkwardly, like, go on mic  And try to get something going  And then, and then you'd deal with the drunks and stuff  And then at the bar or the establishment would close down  You had to break down your own equipment  And then drive all the way back to this guy's house  And put it back in his garage  I fucking hated it  I more liked when you were giving away roses at the Exxon in Islandia  Yeah, I love that  And I'd come driving up in my Apollo work van  Right  Boy, what a meeting of the fucking amazing Opie and Anthony radio show 
[02:46:30]  Those used to be  I'd pull up in my work van  Because I heard Opie on the radio  Like, fucking, gonna be in Islandia at the Exxon station  Giving away roses  That's the BAB days, right?  And I'd pull up and it's like  Opie, how you doing?  You know, huh?  And I, you know, he's giving away roses  And I had to go off to fucking an attic somewhere  How fucked up was that?  That was easy, though  That was easy compared to fucking setting up mobile DJ equipment  Yeah  Oh, God, I hate that  I was so glad that  I actually quit that  I just couldn't handle it  I decided I'll just be poor  And deal with the money I was making  Yeah  You rock comment? 
[02:47:00]  No  Did you ever mobile DJ?  No  You ever DJ?  No  No  And there's guys out there that do it  And they do it very well  I was absolutely not that guy  I just fucking hated it  Troy Kwan  He can DJ  Yeah, but he doesn't have to, like, set up his shit  That's what I mean  These were low-level, who-gives-a-fuck gigs  So degrading  It was  Because you're a radio guy  And then you go to an event  Like, you get hired for a birthday party  Or an anniversary or something  And you see them from, like, the oldie station 
[02:47:30]  Or the classic rock station  And they're just spinning dance music for you  And didn't you just have to carry crates of records?  All that  Because it was just records back then  When I was doing that  Wait, tons  Dude, the amount of equipment  I had to pop into my Honda Accord  Now you get a fucking computer  Yeah  A little laptop  And you're fucking  You're spinning  Yeah, I'm a DJ  I'm a DJ  I fucking have a laptop  And I press the fucking button  Fuck  Yeah  That's fucked up right there, yo  You're mad that the Peter Noonan guy 
[02:48:00]  Is his name?  Peter Noon  Peter Noonan  It's just Noon  Noon  Peter Noon guy has a show here, too  With Sam  Oh, my God  Yeah, that's what I'm saying  It's so annoying, isn't it?  As long as you don't spend any time  Trying to figure out how to do a radio show  Like, as long as you don't work in radio  You get a pretty good shot at getting a show here  Yeah  Like, if you've got any notoriety for doing anything  Uh-huh  Whether you at one point were a singer  As long as it's not radio  As long as it's not radio  Then you can get a show  Then you get a show  And let me tell you the other side of it  Because now that he's our pal  Denny 
[02:48:30]  Denny does everything for that fucking show  And gets paid nothing  Of course  And they just give Peter Noon the big fucking fat paycheck  Well, yeah, you gotta  Because he's the name  You gotta get the radio guys to produce these shows  Right  And they pretend  So they get the actual radio guy  That knows what the fuck he's doing  That could do exactly what Peter Noon's doing, by the way  Better  But because Peter Noon has the name  He gets the big fucking paycheck  And then, you know  Denny all fucked up on tequila  Has to put the show together  But, like, Marky Ramone has a show 
[02:49:00]  It's just because he's, like, the last name of Ramone  And I know it goes into  They don't come cheap  I know it goes into Marky Ramone's show  I know what Marky does  And I know what his producer does  Because I talk to his producer  Yeah  What does Marky do?  Marky shows up  And says what  Literally word for word  What his producer tells him to  And then they mix it together  And then he has to go back  And make it sound like something  Right  But he's not sitting  He's out of here  He's not sitting there  Listening to the songs  Waiting for it to end 
[02:49:30]  So he could pop in  No  I don't think he knows a single one  Uh-huh  Look at these specialty DJs  They do maybe an hour's work  A week  Yeah, they go into a studio  They record some lines  And then a producer  And then the actual radio guy  Has put the whole thing together  Puts it together  Pieces it together  Like a puzzle  But you don't even need that much notoriety  You could launch a popular website  Yeah  And you'll get a radio show  If you want one  If you want one  Uh-huh  Buzzfeed  Whoever  You know what I like?  You know what I like?  I like the fucking original VJs  That they got here 
[02:50:00]  Because I'll see, like, fucking  Mark Goodman  Out by the computers  And he's actually doing some work  Right  No, he's not  I don't know what it is  But he's doing something  There's nothing new  That comes out of the 80s  But he's there  On the computer  What kind of work could it be?  He's on the computer  Just announcing people who've died  He's too  Oh, you think he's just looking up  Obituaries for fucking  80s guys  Let me make sure this guy's still alive  Fucking  Yeah, yeah  Oh, is a fucking  What's his name?  Tommy Two-Tone dead?  Yeah, he is  Let me  Let me see what happened  Is he really?  To the 8675309 guy  Yeah, Tommy Two-Tone's dead  Oh, he's done 
[02:50:30]  Yep  That's too bad  Or like, hey  I've been waiting for that second hit  For a while  Yeah  Yo, hey, come on in  Hey  Why are they walking by?  Hey  Come in  Oh, come on  At least say hi  Come on  What's the matter?  Come in and say hi  Come on  Ah  It's tequila and donut Friday  It's tequila and donut Friday  But who?  Because he said?  Because E-Rock said?  Hey, we got Denny to do a shot  Because you said  I never said that  Nah, nah, nah, nah  Because you said  Did you have tequila yet? 
[02:51:00]  Nah, nah, nah  Because you said  I never said it was tequila Friday  By the way  How about one shot?  No  You know one shot won't do much  No, no  We got Denny to do a shot  One, no  What's your gonna do on, right?  I'll do a shot if someone else does one  Just so I  E-Rock  E-Rock  E-Rock  And by the way  You're looking at Rich Davis  Yeah  The last person to work in radio  To get a radio show  Rich Davis, everybody  That's true  Last person  Last one  An actual radio guy  That got a radio show  Now if you  You know  Now if you  Had some kind of a  Singing career 
[02:51:30]  Maybe you were an actor  Maybe you're an airline pilot  Any other profession  Besides radio  You get a radio gig now  Every job  Every radio job I left  I was replaced by  Automation  Or like a celebrity host  A celebrity host  Right, right  Nicole's body language  Is saying  I ain't doing no fucking tequila  I mean that makes me  No  You want a bump?

[02:52:30]  Her feet  Her Uggs  Yeah, she's got Uggs on  Even when she's not wearing  Uggs  I thought she was  Walking around barefoot  Uggs  If E-Rock gets fired  Maybe they'll replace  The host of the  Weekend Countdown  With somebody who wrote  An interesting article in Cosmo  Oh, that's a good one  You're a little bitter, Sam  You're too young to be bitter  Maybe the guy who played  With Billy Joel  That kid could have a show  Anthony  Yeah  Don't even fuck around  Because they would give him  A show in a heartbeat  Which channel would he get? 
[02:53:00]  OutQ  Yeah, he could be on  Any channel  If he's like  Oh, you know I'm a Bruce fan  Oh, how would you like  To do a daily show  On the Bruce channel  Oh, okay  All right  I saw the OutQ guys  They were walking down  The long hall  Yeah  Heard the commotion  And I saw them both  Turn around  I don't know if it had  Anything to do with us  But I'm thinking people  Are now starting to avoid  Our tequila donut day  Is this getting  Yeah, we're invited  Is this getting talk  Scuttlebutt around the building  Much like Kenny's  Walking us to the bathroom thing?  I think so  You rock and me are both  During the breaks 
[02:53:30]  Going spot to spot  Looking for people  Looking for people  That want to participate  Sam, you know  The show likes a good list  I think we've got to  Start a list  Okay  For tequila and donut day  Get on that, Schindler  You start working on that list  We're going to take a break  We're going to get Rich Vost in here next  And  Maybe we can knock him off  That pesky sobriety  Have him do a fucking shot  Sure  Tequila donut day  You gave it a solid B  Where are we at now though?  You might have to be up in that  To a B plus  Dude, with the amount of people  That are coming in  The festive party atmosphere  The amount of donuts 
[02:54:00]  That have been eaten  You can't give an A officially yet  I'm giving it a strong B plus  Strong B plus  Strong B plus  Now the audio portion  Of your  The tequila and donut day list  Has begun with  The takers  Sex man has  Done five shots  Five shots  Denny, the golden voice  Of seriously  Has done three shots  Stinky has done one shot  And Rick  Rich Davis  Sorry, Rich Davis  Is he the Rich from  Covino and Rich?  Yes, he is  I didn't know that  But that's the trick 
[02:54:30]  I didn't even want to  Bring that up to him  Right  Even because he works in radio  To get a nice paycheck  They make him do  A morning and afternoon  Two shows  He's got to do the two  But do you realize  The Herman Hermits guy  One hour a week  Yeah  And I guarantee  He makes way more money  Do you realize  If he was a software mogul  How much he could make  In radio  By getting his own show  On Sirius Tech  Or something  Do they have that?  They would create  They would create  Sirius Tech  What about Roland?  Oh, Roland did a shot 
[02:55:00]  Oh, Rolando did a shot  Yes, but he did his own  To kill  Because he's, of course  Always promoting  The Clooney  He was promoting  George Clooney's tequila  I hear I have a bottle  Of the Clooney tequila  Waiting for me  Which I will bring home  And this evening  I might have to partake  You know  When you're supposed to drink  At night  Dan's telling everyone that  On a Friday night  Yeah, and that's coming from me  Not at work  All right  No  Morning mashup  Is coming back down the hall  Should we ask him again?

Will probably be  Movies  Go to sleep  Yeah  Nothing exciting  No  Play with video games? 
[02:57:30]  Nah  How is he not more fucked up?  I'm a little confused  He is  He's trying not to talk a lot  If you notice  There's a lot of one and two answer  Fucking  One and two word answers here  Let's have him read something  He just tapped himself on the nose  He barely made it  Oh yeah  Yeah  It gets worse  More of Opie and Anthony's worst in 2013  So far  Coming up  Opie and Anthony's worst in 2013 
[02:58:00]  So far  Continues right now  Yeah  Now  Now  For those of you that just joined us  Dennis works with the 60s  And the music channel  We call it the Decades  Program  The Decades channel  And Cousin Brucie  And Cousin Brucie  And that's why earlier we played some Vanilla Fudge  And we were just getting into the whole vibe  Right  Of the 60s music  You ever just kick back  In a bubble bath  Maybe with a significant other  Just listening to the 60s

That's really up to you  We're running out of choices there  I think something  I would ask him  Is good  No, he doesn't like sweets  Or the apple filled even  Is kind of nice with the tequila  So do you eat the donut  First  And how do you do it?  Do you take a bite  And then  E-Rock?

Third place  You should have third place  There's a tie  You'll sleep better on the plane  Yeah, you'll sleep on the plane  I feel like I'm going to throw up just after that  One shot  Four people tied with one shot each  And we never found out what's wrong with her marriage  Yeah, yeah  What's the biggest annoyance with being married?

[03:30:30]  Because he took me out to dinner  What a bitch, right?  That is fucking  I'd be so pissed  Like I'm fucking taking it out to dinner  Are you bitching at me?  Yep  And I'd say  Keep your fucking mother out of our shit  Don't let her fucking influence  What I'm doing  She don't know me  If she wants to come over here  And suck my dick  Then she can comment on  What a fucking asshole I am  Wow  You gotta lay these bitches out  Straight  To suck a dick  Hey, you know what?  I don't know about this  Then she'll probably shut the fuck up next time  And she didn't do anything  She was the one that put the bug in your ear  About him being complacent

[03:35:00]  Danny's in second with three shots  And E-Rock's up to eight  Eight?  Eight, because he did two just now  Did you really?  And let's put Handsome Johnny Tube Steaks on the list there  Yep, put them on the board  One shot  One more than Sal  By the way  Handsome Johnny Tube Steaks has been talking for the last time  Handsome Johnny Tube Steaks  It's a fucking  Well, he's got the eyes  Rich Voss pointed out the eyes  He's got the eyes  Is that what it is?  It's sparkling blue eyes?  The kid was a ten  My kid's going to go places 
[03:35:30]  You think he's got a future in the business?  Don't let Danny see me slouching, by the way  As I broadcast  No, he wouldn't like that  He wouldn't like that at all  You have to sit up straight when you broadcast  You guys don't stand up  Slouching and slurring  Slouching and slurring is the name of this show  Johnny's been talking for the last two days  About the big trade?  About the fact that Opie wants him here really bad  Yeah?  Yeah  What's he been saying?  He's just been excited  One, that he's been talked about  And two, he'll take Sal's place in a moment  In a moment  In a moment 
[03:36:00]  In a moment  In a moment  You are really on a hard time  Holding together this fucking speaking  This is what I want to aspire to  Is Eric fucking sloppily talking on the radio  Excuse me  Excuse me  Oh shit  I've been providing content for three fucking hours  What?  By just drinking and making yourself seem super pathetic  And guess what?  The hosts don't like you  And by the way  Sal is sitting there being like  I'm not going to provide content  By just drinking tequila 
[03:36:30]  If you guys want me to put on a thong  And bronzer up my body  I'll do that  Oh wow  Sal  Sam, you fucking nailed him  Because he rocks the man today  I think Sal's being a party pooper  He is  Why are you being a party pooper, Sal?  What's going through your mind?  What do you want me to do?  What do you think could be saved  If you come in and take a shot?  Yeah, what's going through your mind?  Coffee shot  I'm sorry  I would do it gladly after the show  But not right now  After the show  Is this a professional decision?  No, it's not professional  I just think it's kind of pathetic here watching Eric get fucking drunk  But it's tequila and donut Friday 
[03:37:00]  And by the way  Listen to this list  If this was a regular fucking Tuesday  Then it would be a little weird  Two for Tuesday  Right, but this was a package E-Rock put together  Listen to this list  A bit  He put a bit together for the show  The Sex Man  Denny  Tay-Tay  Road Dog  Stinky  Rich Davis  Big Dave LaGreca  Handsome Johnny Tube Steaks  Those are the prime time players of Sirius XM  Not one pathetic name  No, exactly  And those are the people taking shots  That's the cool table  You know what?  That's the cool table 
[03:37:30]  That's the back of the bus  That's the back of the bus  Back of the fucking bus  We got eight guys that have done the tequila  You know what?  This is  You watch Mad Men  This was every day for them  Every day  Every day  And cigarettes by the way  Every day  We're not even talking cigarettes  Every fucking day  And Sal's over  I just think it's really pathetic  That these guys are subjective  I didn't say them  I said Eric  Because Eric's getting fucking hammered  And he's the fucking man  You know what?  I'll do something better  I'll show you the pictures of the guy  That I took this morning on the train  It's like  Oh, that's right  I didn't take him  Anthony?

No one cares about you  Turn your mic off  Not only have I not almost died for this show  Not almost died  Not almost died  Right, right, of course  I've taken body scarring with hot wax shots  Which we're gonna redo for the elevator show 
[03:39:00]  Sure  Can we do it today?

[04:06:30]  But because of budget cuts  Or format flip  Or something else  You're not going to be working here anymore  Right  So give your final sign off  Sal will pick a song  No he'll pick a song  Then he needs his song  It's his final show  Alright  You should at least give him that  You should at least give him that  Well you got a song for me  Sal will get the song  Know what song you want  As your last song on radio  Let me see  How about Goodbye I Love You  I think that's a good one  By Firefall  Sort of sentimental  No one knows that song  I know that song  1979 hit music 
[04:07:00]  Yeah but that's for nerds  How about Deep Purple  Smoke on the Water  There you go  Really?  Oh wow really  That's not cliche  No you pick your song Danny  Don't be influenced  Well I'm trying to get a good song here  Go back to your first song  How about the Tramps  Disco Inferno  As we burn this thing up  Oh man  Come on  You got it?  Which one do you want?  I want the single version  Of Disco Inferno  Don't give me the seven minute version  Oh  Cause that's what they play  On the Studio 54 channel
