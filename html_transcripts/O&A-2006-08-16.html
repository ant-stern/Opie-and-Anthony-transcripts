<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a discussion of the deaths of Bruno Kirby and Sammy Davis Jr., quickly transitioning to a detailed recounting of their infamous "Voyeur Bus" incident, including CNN reporter Jeannie Moose's role in its aftermath and Rudy Giuliani's condemnation of their actions as "stupid."  They then dissect a seemingly absurd Jeannie Moose CNN segment on airport carry-on regulations.  The hosts move on to mocking a Virginia Senator who used the racial slur "Makaka" towards a young campaign volunteer.  This is followed by jabs at a weatherman, Mike Woods, known for awkward on-air responses, and Barack Obama's perceived hypocrisy regarding SUVs. A caller complains about excessive bleeping on their XM broadcast.  The hosts also mention an upcoming comedy show and a Broadway play they deemed the "gayest thing" they'd ever seen. A caller, Raj, expresses offense at the mockery of the Indian reporter, sparking further playful insults. Another caller inquires about a Jimmy Norton DVD.  The show then praises the cringe-inducing quality of "The Comeback," contrasting it with the general audience's aversion to discomfort. The hosts discuss their upcoming "Traveling Virus" comedy show, including planned video segments, and conclude with cynical musings on God's existence prompted by a discussion of a tragic event and the inexplicable cuteness of puppies.

The show then shifts to a news story about a truck fire that killed 60 puppies, sparking dark humor from the hosts and callers.  This is followed by listener-submitted jokes and calls. Studio guests Otto and George promote their upcoming comedy shows.  Extensive discussion of PalTalk, a webcam platform, ensues, including jokes about potential inappropriate acts witnessed by viewers.  More mockery of Mike Woods follows, along with a brief, quickly dismissed news story about a child traumatized by being placed in an elevator closet.  A large portion of the show details their "walkover" to XM Satellite Radio, filled with vulgar commentary about passersby, bodily functions, and random observations, including a comment on the lack of homeless Chinese people.  A "Daily Dump Report" analyzing censored words is discussed at length, followed by a long segment about a "wigger" contestant on Flavor of Love and a discussion about the authenticity of her persona. Finally, a top heavy metal albums list (allegedly compiled by Jimmy Norton) is presented and discussed.

The next segment begins with a discussion of this heavy metal list, with a caller, Pete, jokingly advocating for Jethro Tull's inclusion.  This transitions to a promotion for an event at Opie's brother's restaurant, FH Riley's, hosted by Master Poe, including a critique of Master Poe's promotional video.  The show then features several caller discussions covering various topics, including Opie's restaurant, Jimmy's stand-up gigs, a caller's cruise on a tilted ship, a song about "a kick in the cunt," a caller's city job, their firing from SiriusXM's "Sex with Sam," and a caller's thoughts on terrestrial versus XM show versions.  Further discussion includes a Howard Stern commercial, a caller's story about a coworker with a "doggy station," Jimmy's stand-up material, a caller's complaints about the hosts' "ranting and raving," a misunderstanding with Ron and Fez, a local newscaster's accidental airing of unedited profanity, a caller's request for a tape from Otto, and Otto's habit of making empty promises.  A caller discusses XM's perceived lack of appreciation for the show and the reasons behind the channel's name, "High Voltage."  Another caller recounts a story about Jimmy's bit on drinking and Lady Di, which his 12-step friends found hilarious.  A clip of a radio personality quitting live on the air is played, followed by more listener calls, comparisons of the hostsâ€™ appearances to celebrities, a revisited "Ron and Fez" issue, and a mention of Stacy Stone from a Christian radio station.


The broadcast continues with a call-in portion featuring listener prayers, followed by callers criticizing the show and comparing it unfavorably to Ron and Fez. More listener calls, both complimentary and critical, ensue. A significant portion is dedicated to an in-studio interview with Rebecca Love, a porn star. Rebecca discusses her career, preferences, and a recent injury sustained during a photoshoot. The conversation becomes graphic and detailed, featuring sexually explicit banter between the hosts and Rebecca.  The segment ends with more listener calls, continued discussion about Ron and Fez, further sexually explicit conversation with Rebecca, including demonstrations of sexual positions using props. The final minutes include a discussion about a news story regarding a passenger attempting to board a plane with suspicious items, concluding abruptly with more sexually explicit jokes and a brief mention of upcoming live shows. The show's main recurring topics include "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday,"  videos of the "Ghost Ride the Whip" trend, mocking audio clips of Karen Meyer, and discussions of their new TV commercial.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the hosts engage in frequent vulgar language and offensive comments.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  Messicans.  That sucks.  Lesbians.  I like that in a woman.  And every other kind of beef.  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay weakens our resistance.  Dude.  The onslaught of the communist masters of deceit.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  And yeah, we're back.  Where have you been? 
[00:00:30]  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  The O.P. and Anthony program.  Elvido.  The O.P.  And Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  O.P.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that fact.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with 
[00:01:00]  Down syndrome children.  No, man.  It's terrible.  The O.P. and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I know a thing or two about a thing or two.  Shut your goddamn pie hole.  Liar, whore.  Liar, whore.  And you know it.  Fancy talk.  Fancy talk for a whore. 
[00:01:30]  For a whore.  A couple of very beautiful girls, huh?  Who are you tonight?  The Kit Kat Club?  Hey, are you about a size 14?  Are you about a size 14?  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  Whore.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  Good morning. 
[00:02:00]  Good morning.  Is it Whip Em Out Wednesday?  It certainly is.  Check the calendar.  Yes.  W.  Wednesday.  I was having lunch after the show yesterday.  Just hanging out, having a burger.  Out in the Hamptons?  With anyone special?  Just in my hood, a little burger joint.  Oh, okay.  No big deal.  Thought maybe you were being a big shot.  One of these places that has like a menu that's like this thick.  Opie just held his thumb and forefinger about an inch apart. 
[00:02:30]  So many choices.  What do I do?  What do I get?  I'll just have a burger.  And I'm sitting there.  And all of a sudden, these guys are talking about the Opie and Anthony show.  Uh-oh.  No clue that I'm sitting right there.  Oh, that's dangerous.  You almost want them to know you're there.  And the question, do you listen to Opie and Anthony?  And the one guy's like, nah.  And now I'm just waiting for the guy to explain the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:03:00]  And then the other guy saying, wow, well, that's real stupid.  That sucks, dude.  But thank God that did not happen.  But the guy starts talking about Hummer Tuesday.  Wow.  Forgot about that.  And I went, oh, my God.  We got to get that going again.  Forgot about that.  It was a treat.  Yeah.  Hummer Tuesday.  Because it was Tuesday yesterday, obviously.  So these guys were talking about the radio show.  And the guy's saying, yeah, they used to do this bit.  It was really fun and funny and blah, blah, blah. 
[00:03:30]  It was called Hummer Tuesday.  They were trying to get our chicks to, you know, give us a little action every Tuesday night.  Well, something special on Tuesday night.  And then the guy who has no clue who we are is like, hey, that's kind of cool.  And then he was talking about how we're back on regular radio, blah, blah, blah.  I was well informed.  And I was just listening in going, oh, please don't say anything bad.  Please don't say anything bad.  Oh, I can't take it.  It'll crush me.  Yeah, sure.  So anyway, it's Whip About Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:04:00]  As long as we don't get something for every day of the week.  Yeah, I know.  Can't do that.  Yeah, but our stuff is kind of cool.  Yeah, but even if we've got to leave at least one day out.  Just because every hack show has something for every day.  We've got one so far.  We might go for Hummer Tuesday again.  Yeah.  Yeah, we might have to get that going again.  But Whip About Wednesday has been happening for, what, 10 years, 11 years?  I think it's 83 years now.  Actually, it's probably about 11, maybe 12 years. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  There's a dumb show in San Francisco.  Lamont and Tonelli, who completely ripped off our wow promotion.  Completely ripped it off.  Didn't even change the name, really.  Well, then they move on from the station they were on to another station.  And now it's property of their old station, even though it's our bit.  How is that?  So they had to go to another radio station, and they changed it to Ta-Ta Tuesdays.  Bit Court.  Ta-Ta Tuesdays. 
[00:05:00]  I've got to tell you, this business is filled with scumbags, filled with guys that don't  come up with any of their own stuff.  And now with the internet and with everyone having a website, they just troll the websites,  they troll the popular shows, and they go, well, that's good.  I want to do that.  I want to do this.  It's like a menu.  And how thick is that menu, Woppy?  Could you show me?  About this thick.  Again, one inch.  But it's like a menu.  These guys don't even have to show prep anymore.  But the point I'm making, it's always been known that radio is filled with guys that just 
[00:05:30]  rip off from other guys.  But with the Whip-A-Mount Wednesday thing, in general, radio has left that promotion alone.  In general.  There's been a few.  Because it's one of those benchmark things that we did that really got a lot of attention,  especially up in Boston when we were up there.  I mean, it was all over the news and everything.  And it really was tied into this show.  So to take it word for word, you know, would seem a little silly.  And everybody would be on to it. 
[00:06:00]  And they were.  Right.  Well, Lycus grabbed it.  Mankow grabbed it in Chicago.  But he was calling it Whip-It Out Wednesday.  There you go.  I don't know what he's into.  Oops, I saw some things I didn't really like.  I should have named it something else.  He's either into Olivia Newton-John or guys.  We're trying to figure it out.  And then Lamont and Tinelli there in San Francisco, completely taking the bit.  Completely.  But then they, like I said, they leave their one radio station. 
[00:06:30]  So I guess all the bits they did at this radio station, they're not allowed to do at the  new place?  I guess not.  So now, like, this obscure radio station in San Francisco owns Whip-It Out Wednesday for  San Francisco, even though it's our bit.  That just amazes me.  Well, good luck trying to hold on to that one because we are saying that we are doing it.  And we're finally being heard in San Francisco.  So we can tell a lot of the Lamont and Tinelli listeners where Whip-It Out Wednesday came  from.  Sue us.  You know, we had a girl flash her boobs on the Today Show years ago. 
[00:07:00]  You might be able to find it online somewhere.  Good luck.  You can maybe find it on opandanthony.com.  And they were panning the line like they do every morning on the Today Show.  She lifts up her shirt.  There's her boobs.  Big wow sticker.  For everyone to see, this was before Janet Jackson, by the way, and right below the boobs  was one of our Whip-It Out Wednesday stickers.  Do you know that Lamont and Tinelli went on their show and said that one of their people  flashed on the Today Show and their listeners bought it? 
[00:07:30]  But she was in our studio.  We were talking to her about it.  Yeah, but see, we were separated because no one heard us in San Francisco back then.  Yeah.  So they didn't know any better.  And we had done it years before in Boston, too.  We got proof that it goes back to, I don't know, like 94-ish, 95, somewhere around there.  And we still do it.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's Whip-It Out Wednesday.  It's very, very simple.  We're on a lot of radio stations.  Some of the radio stations are very aggressive.  And they're handing out wow stickers at events. 
[00:08:00]  Or they got an area on their website where you could mail in for your wow sticker.  And other stations, they're just hanging and just taking the show.  And that's it.  So I don't know what to tell you.  You can either get an official wow bumper sticker if the station you're listening to us on is aggressive.  Go to their website.  See what they're doing with the wow stickers.  Or you can make your own wow sticker.  That works well.  Yeah.  Whatever works.  And basically, there's women out there.  Not basically.  We hear from them every Wednesday. 
[00:08:30]  They will flash you if they see a wow sticker.  See the wow sticker?  They pull up next to you.  Get a little flash.  A little something to a break of the monotony of your drive home, where to work, wherever you're going.  It's a beautiful thing.  Right.  And all we ask, and it's been working like this for many, many years.  Don't harass the ladies.  No.  Once they flash, it's over, Johnny.  Just let them go.  Or if a woman doesn't feel like flashing, then just move on.  This is the greatest radio contest because you got lots of winners every Wednesday. 
[00:09:00]  All you do is put a sticker or a wow somewhere on your car, and that's it.  Your job is done.  And we hear from people every week, you know, I had the sticker on for months and months,  and I thought, oh, this is a bunch of BS.  And then all of a sudden, it happened.  Like fishing.  It is like fishing.  Always said it.  Like fishing.  And, you know, that famous phrase, you got to be in it to win it.  So get a wow sticker on your car or a homemade wow sign and see what happens, okay? 
[00:09:30]  Right.  All right.  So welcome to Whip Him Out Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Almost there.  The phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Let's say hi to James in New Hampshire.  What's up, James?  How's it going, boys?  All right.  I'm very nervous.  I'm on the air.  Oh, don't be.  Calm down, sir.  You'll be fine.  Just wanted to let you fellas know that driving up here in New Hampshire, I drive around all 
[00:10:00]  day, and I saw my first two wow stickers yesterday.  So if you get up here to smash the morning buzz eventually.  The morning buzz we're up against?  Greg and the morning buzz.  You guys aren't up here yet, but you can come up here to smash the hell out of them.  I thought we were up in New Hampshire.  Oh, no, we're in Providence.  Okay.  We'll look to smash them, sir, just for you.  Thank you, James.  Fantastic.  Thank you, fellas.  So basically, you called to say that you saw wow stickers. 
[00:10:30]  Pretty much.  I'm a useless loser.  That is a prelude to wowing, is seeing the stickers.  All right, James.  Thank you.  I apologize for wasting your time on this fine whip about Wednesday.  All right.  No worries.  I don't know if that word's legal.  What?  I thought you were going to that guy.  Oh, I know.  I know.  That was another thing we did.  We did it six o'clock every afternoon, early evening.  Yeah, it was another great thing. 
[00:11:00]  It was a release of gases.  A release of air.  A release of air, let's say.  From an area where you're not used to really hearing air be released.  And we do it every day.  And maybe we'll do it again.  Who knows?  Stop the crying.  Who cares?  Can you just do an entertaining show without bitching or talking about Howie?  No.  What?  Bob Barker has written this a hundred times.  We haven't even talked about Howie today, you dope. 
[00:11:30]  Now I'm just going to have.  There he goes.  Goodbye, your band.  Bye, Bob.  We haven't even talked about Howie.  What are you talking about, Bob Barker?  Oh.  Why are you listening then?  Just stop.  We want everybody that doesn't like the show to go away.  We chase listeners away.  No, I like them listening.  Yeah, sure.  No, I really do.  When we go over to the XM show, it's everybody that just loves us. 
[00:12:00]  Because they have to pay to listen to us.  Over here, it's nice that you come across people that absolutely hate us.  And they call in or they write instant feedback to tell us how much they hate the show.  It just amazes me that they listen at all.  What is he listening for?  I don't get that.  I don't know.  I've never listened to a show I couldn't stand.  Just like more than a few seconds.  Sometimes it's so bad, it's good.  That's always fun.  I get off watching TV shows that I don't like. 
[00:12:30]  And I get angry just watching them.  I don't know why.  Just get mad watching them.  Yeah.  It's kind of fun at times.  But actually, you know, aggressively call that show.  No.  Or listen to it or watch it on a regular basis.  No, I'm with you.  Why bother?  Why bother?  You know, after a while, you're like, all right, I got to move on.  This isn't for me.  I'll find something I like.  Yeah.  So anyway, in other news overnight, it has been brought to our attention that the Opie and  Anthony TV commercial is out there.  It's running.  Yeah. 
[00:13:00]  Last I heard, Tom was trying to show us the finished product of the Opie and Anthony commercial,  and we couldn't get the disc to work in any of the computers here at Free FM in New York  City.  It's very technical here.  And, oh boy, it was an Imus, I guess, showing our pictures up on MSNBC.  Did you see what Imus is doing today?  What is he doing?  He's talking about us again today and laughing really hard.  He's laughing for some reason.  He's laughing at us.  Well, he loves every time we go after Howard.  He really, really loves that. 
[00:13:30]  So we'll get the audio and see what that's about.  But Imus just had our pictures up on MSNBC, and now he's laughing his ass off.  Calling me a terrorist again?  Who knows?  All right.  Well, yeah, Tom walked around yesterday, and we had to follow him like the Pied Piper with  this DVD.  And for some reason, we couldn't find anything that would play a DVD in the building.  No.  All the computers wouldn't recognize it.  It's one of those things where, I don't know what's happening with burning DVDs. 
[00:14:00]  Sometimes you get them burnt, and sometimes they're movies that you really want to see  and don't want to go to the theater for.  And they don't play.  And one player it'll play, and another one it won't.  It's annoying.  I don't know what the hell it is.  Is it the burning speed?  What is it, Dan?  You know about that, don't you?  You're always burning stuff.  Major motion pictures.  No, I'm not.  No? 
[00:14:30]  Steve always recommends not using the maximum burning speed.  Don't use that.  That will compromise the integrity of the DVD.  And it uses up too much fuel.  It's global warming.  Right.  Slow it down, people.  Yeah, that really is annoying, though.  Because I get certain movies sometimes.  We'll just leave it at that.  They could be old movies that are out already, but I'd prefer them burnt.  They're very old movies.  They've been out two weeks.  Two, three weeks.  Two, three weeks.  And now he's got an action figure that, what the hell is that? 
[00:15:00]  Oh, that's, what's his name?  One of the redneck comedians.  Oh, is that Larry the Cable Guy?  Oh, Larry the Cable Guy.  So distracted by Imus.  I know.  Wow.  And, yeah, I get these things.  And I pop them in, and it's like a crapshoot.  You feel all, they're like, oh, good.  I can watch this tonight.  And I pop it in, and it says, cannot read disc.  Son of a bitch.  It's a crapshoot.  So we walked around yesterday trying to see our commercial. 
[00:15:30]  Computer to computer.  To no avail.  Computer.  Then the production guy here, his computer doesn't work.  No one has a DVD player in the whole place.  Yeah.  So we're like, all right, Tom, we'll take your word for it that it came out great  because there are a few little changes they want to make in the spot.  So I'm trolling through Wackbag last night, and I see a still picture from the commercial  that we hadn't released yet.  I'm like, hey, how'd you get that?  It's a picture of the girl.  I was like, how'd you get that?  He goes, oh, it's playing in West Palm. 
[00:16:00]  Commercial's airing down in West Palm.  But Tom said it wasn't even going to play for another week.  I don't know.  But sure enough, West Palm Beach is already running the Opie and Anthony commercial.  Yeah.  Hello to West Palm Beach today.  And Wackbag.com, one of our fine fan sites, they already have the commercial up and running  on Wackbag.  Yep.  And now I'm hearing Steve C. just threw it up on OpieandAnthony.com.  So there you go.  You can check out the Opie and Anthony commercial.  It is out there, and it's going to run in a bunch of cities, I guess. 
[00:16:30]  Definitely in New York.  Obviously, in West Palm Beach, we'll see who else picks it up.  Any of the other markets want to pick it up?  And so far, the reviews on the commercial are pretty good.  Yeah.  A lot of people thought, because they saw some still pictures, that it might be wacky.  And I had to chastise a few people because we didn't want to do something wacky.  Nothing worse than the wacky DJ commercial.  So this one just kind of, you know, I think it shows our personalities a little bit. 
[00:17:00]  And our listeners are more on top of this show than us, by the way.  Yeah.  Because I came in five, and it's like, the commercial's already up on Wackbag.com.  I'm like, we haven't even seen the finished product yet.  And it's out there.  And now I'm reading it's on YouTube.  It's on OpieandAnthony.com.  The commercial's up on Fundry.  I don't know that.  What is Fundry?  Does anyone know what that is?  Fundry gets spelled?  Fundry?  Foundry?  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me? 
[00:17:30]  That's how they spell Foundry?  That's why people can never get there.  Are you kidding?  That's how they spell Foundry?  Fundry?  Oh, he's got it spelt in the link.  All right.  Well, I thought there was another great website out there like YouTube called Fundry.  I was ready to, like, Google it and see what it was all about.  You know, YouTube is great, but there is so much crap on there.  I put in yesterday because I wanted to see, um, uh, what the hell is that?  Riding Da Whip? 
[00:18:00]  Oh, Ghost Riding?  Ghost Ride Da Whip.  What, what, what?  Because I wanted to see some people getting hurt and really screwing themselves up.  So I put that in on YouTube and got two videos of destruction.  One guy, it was something I had seen a while ago in his red pickup where he climbs out and  he's trying to steer with his foot and he's on the windshield.  And then, uh, he pops up on the curb and he can't get his foot on the steering wheel.  So now he's laying on his hood and the windshield and realizes, uh-oh, I'm in big trouble. 
[00:18:30]  So he bails out, he just falls off his truck, his truck hits a fire hydrant and a telephone  pole, and it's hysterical.  So you can see these videos up there?  Yeah, on YouTube.  And then the other one was, uh, some guy in a little, like, looked like a Toyota or something  doing donuts in a parking lot of a mall.  And as the car's doing donuts, he steps out and it's still, like, revving up, rear wheels  of screaming, smoke's pouring off of him. 
[00:19:00]  He opens his door and now his door is acting like the pivot point and he's holding onto the  door as the car circles him until he falls down and the car runs him over and he's pinned  underneath it.  It's a scream.  Every jackass that tries this should just be killed.  And it should all be put up on YouTube.  But then every other one was just a bunch of dopey wiggers, uh, dancing outside their 
[00:19:30]  car with, you know, they, they walk out.  It's the whole thing, you know, ghost ride the whip.  They, they walk, they step out of their car as it's rolling and dance around and then jump  back in.  And that was it.  Boring.  No, I want to see wrecks.  I want to see, like, I want to see them surfing on the top of their cars and stuff.  Yeah.  This guy got so screwed up.  The car for the front tires run him over.  He rolls like the car starts rolling him.  And then he's stuck between the road and the bottom of the car as the car is still at full 
[00:20:00]  speed.  So smoke's pouring off the wheels and it can't go anywhere because his body is jammed between  the frame.  Nice.  And, uh, the street.  I'm looking at one, man.  He gets out of his car.  He's dancing on the side of the car.  The car's still moving.  Then he jumps on the hood and he's dancing as he's sitting down.  What is, I think it's awesome.  It is so dumb.  I, someone had to come up with this.  It's all the rage.  For who?  I'm telling you.  It's all the rage in the, in, in the hoods, especially. 
[00:20:30]  I don't know.  To me, watching the videos, it looked like a bunch of dopey white boys trying to, uh,  be hip.  Well, look.  Trying to be cool.  You know what?  Yeah.  Leave it, leave it to the, leave it to the homies.  I'm looking at a couple of white boys doing the ghost riding right now.  They're in a court.  In a court?  They're in a court.  In an upscale neighborhood?  Yeah, and they're looking.  With daddy's car?  They're trying to look cool.  There's obviously no traffic whatsoever.  Look how big the house is.  Yeah, there's huge mansions in the background.  Even though they're trying to look like they're from the hood, they got the hat on the right 
[00:21:00]  way.  Just stop.  They got their collars popped.  You're not doing anything.  Look at these huge mansions.  Who are you fooling?  Unless you've shot someone and stolen the vehicle, it's not really authentic.  Right.  Right on.  Also, this Communique God.  I'm so glad we're in the loop.  The TV spot is also up on the Buzz's website in West Palm Beach.  That's buzz103.com.  All right?  And we got the iMIS audio? 
[00:21:30]  All right, cool.  We got lots to do today.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus is definitely spreading across America, and we couldn't be happier.  Thanks for checking us out today on this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  More in just a bit.  I came up with something years ago.  Basically, it says,  Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.

Pittsburgh's loving the Opie and Anthony show, and they're very aggressive.  You go to their website, you can get Wow Stickers.  West Palm Beach, same thing.  Cleveland, and San Francisco, believe it or not.  We've only been on in San Francisco like a week, maybe two weeks.  Yep.  But they're already very, very aggressive as far as the Opie and Anthony show goes, 
[00:23:00]  and you can get Wow Stickers by going to their website.  All the other stations?  Oh, not yet, huh?  I don't know what's going on.  Well, some of them just came on board.  You know, we've got to welcome Las Vegas.  How you doing there, Vegas?  Is that today?  I don't know.  We're on in Vegas?  I say it just in case.  No.  Not until the...  I know we're going on in Vegas soon.  I think soon.  I'm not sure of the exact date.  I look at my watch like I know. 
[00:23:30]  All right, so there you have it.  For the other radio stations you're listening to us on, I don't know how you're going to get your Wow Stickers at this point.  We've got to figure that out.  But it is Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Get the sticker on your car and enjoy.  We were just saying a few minutes ago that Mr. Imus was giving us props once again on his radio show.  Yes, he was.  We've got MSNBC on in the background here.  We've got a lot of TVs here in New York City so we could keep an eye on things.  And one of the TVs is dedicated to MSNBC. 
[00:24:00]  MSNBC.  Yeah, he's broadcast on there in the mornings.  And he had this to say about us about, I don't know, 15 minutes ago.  I was listening to Opie and Anthony yesterday and little Jimmy Norton.  He was there.  And they, I don't know where they were.  They could have been in Chicago.  I'm not sure.  That guy Norton is a riot.  Oh, man, they are screaming.  So, anyway. 
[00:24:30]  He thought we were on in Chicago, broadcasting from Chicago.  See how good we are?  See?  See, Phil?  See how good we are?  See how good we are, Phil?  At Sound and Local?  No matter where we are.  Even Imus thought we were in Chicago yesterday.  Where are they?  Alaska?  Where?  What planet are they broadcasting from?  Is it really tough to fool Imus, though?  I know. 
[00:25:00]  Let's be honest with each other.  He's a legend, but he thinks we're broadcasting from Chicago.  Chicago?  What an idiot.  So, anyway.  They're playing these public service announcements that run in Chicago for handicapped people.  Oh, God.  Sounds like a scream.  Yeah.  Well, I mean...  That was good for a lead.  There you go.  We played PSAs for handicapped people? 
[00:25:30]  I think he was referring to the woman...  What's her name?  I'm sorry.  Karen Meyer.  Karen Meyer.  Yeah.  She's deaf, and she does all the handicapped segments on the news.  And whenever they have a handicapped news story, she's the one they pull out, and she does it in her inimitable style.  And that's what we were playing, and I guess Imus had heard that portion of the program. 
[00:26:00]  All right.  They're not PSAs.  PSAs or something.  It's a...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was just laughing at...  It's a deaf news woman that does these pieces on the handicapped, I guess.  Yeah.  Well, I mean...  That was good for a lead.  There you go.  It's nothing you can...  There's nothing that you should do.  What they do, but...  Nothing like making fun of the listeners who are fortunate. 
[00:26:30]  Handicapped, runner's deal.  Well, that's too funny.  I mean, it doesn't get any funnier.  Did Jeffrey happen to hear that yesterday?  Well, that's what I'm saying.  It's not something I would do, but that doesn't mean I don't think they should.  That's just...  Maybe I was tired.  I was screaming, laughing.  Maybe it was the OxyContin or something.  I thought it wasn't, you know, if I could get some.  He doesn't even know what he was listening to yesterday.  He was laughing, though.  Yeah, he was laughing.  That's good.  It's nothing he would do. 
[00:27:00]  Nothing I would do.  You got to goof on it, though.  Yeah, someone's got to point these things out.  We're sorry that we have to be the people that do it, but if there's a deaf reporter and they only give her the handicapped stories, someone's got to point that out.  Yeah, absolutely.  Matter of fact, we got one more segment from her if you want to go there.  Well, for Imus.  He seemed to enjoy it so much.  For Imus?  Yeah, why not?  Well, he listens to us on the Albuquerque station, because he's still down there in New Mexico. 
[00:27:30]  Down there in New Mexico.  At his ranch, so I guess he listens to us in the afternoon or something.  Doing my show on horseback.  I think they rebroadcast the show in afternoons.  Yeah.  I don't know.  So that gives him the chance to...  Is it?  Or is it?  I don't know.  I'm learning all the stations we're on.  We're figuring it out.  And when they play the show.  Most of them pick it up in the morning.  Well, we could do it again.  It's Karen Meyer.  We got one last segment from her.  We were going to save this for another day, but now that Imus is talking about it, maybe we should give him a little more. 
[00:28:00]  That we shouldn't do it, and I wouldn't do it.  Well, this is the worst one, too.  Uh-oh, what is it?  It's Karen Meyer.  The setup, she works there in Chicago, and she's deaf.  And they throw her on the news, and she does these cute little stories about the less fortunate.  And the one I'm about to play.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Teaching Down Syndrome kids to read.  Oh, no.  Okay.  Maybe we shouldn't. 
[00:28:30]  What?  I want, you know something, I'm going to look at this in an open mind and try to be, try to be inspired by it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm really going to give it a try.  I'm going to look at this like human beings look at it.  This is a stretch for me.  It's really a stretch.  But like human beings, the people that tune in and go like, oh, oh, that's sweet.  I'm going to try to look at it like that.  But in all fairness. 
[00:29:00]  Don't look at me, because I'll laugh.  When we played this audio yesterday, it wasn't about what she was talking about.  It was how she was talking.  It was how, because you can't really understand her.  She's on the news in a huge market, and you can't understand what she's saying.  Mm-hmm.  But we learned yesterday they have subtitles or something.  Yeah, they have to put subtitles on.  If you've got to do that, well, I'm going to try.  I'm going to try.  You're going to try not to laugh?  I'm going to try not to laugh and to really look into this story and be inspired.  All right.  It's Karen Meyer. 
[00:29:30]  From Chicago.  Teaching Down Syndrome kids to read.  Shuttle with Down Syndrome.  Learn to read in a different way.  ABC 7's Karen Meyer joins us.  The color.  So far, so good.  With a stick.  I was like, wow, she's really learning how to talk.  Sorry.  I can't.  I'm hearing it already.  Learn to read in a different way.  With a boot to the chin.  It's the stupid.  Children with Down Syndrome learn to read in a different way.  ABC 7's Karen Meyer joins us.  We'll tell her about that. 
[00:30:00]  Karen?  Linda and Sophia.  Children with Down Syndrome can learn to read.  As young as preschool age, once they start the week, that's how incredible.  Three days a week at Judy's playhouse in Hoffman Estate.  Children are taught reading.  And which one says jump?  Nice job.  The easiest way for them to learn to read is to teach them whole words first.  Okay, so which one of these says cut?  Jerry Andrus is the literacy program director. 
[00:30:30]  The mother of a child with Down Syndrome.  I can't.  I said we just stop here, man.  I can't.  What a mess.  Well, well, well, I can't understand.  Ander, she's talking about a subject that I could just go off on for an hour.  Who is watching this in Chicago and taking it seriously? 
[00:31:00]  It's a freak show.  They're the awe people.  There's not many awe people out there.  You see them on talk shows and stuff sometimes when they bring out or these other entertainment shows.  When they show something and the whole audience goes, oh, they're the awe people.  You want to just drop gas into the building when people go, oh.  You remember when Rosie O'Donnell did the retard movie, riding the bus with my sister? 
[00:31:30]  And it was just a scream.  It's a comedy.  The thing is a comedy.  It's Rosie O'Donnell going so over the top, playing this retarded woman.  Well, she sounded like Pee Wee Herman.  Yeah.  I got to get on the bus.  Get on the bus.  Just over the top.  And Tony Danza, during his show, when that was on, he showed a picture of her. 
[00:32:00]  He goes, let's look at Rosie and see what she looks like in costume.  Just look at this because it's adorable.  And they showed her and the audience went, oh, she's wearing like this Shirley Hemple wig.  She's got one red and one blue sneaker on.  You know, she's like wet her pants.  She's just a mess.  And the audience goes, oh, and it gives me like goosebumps.  The audience. 
[00:32:30]  But Tony Danza doesn't mean that.  No, I was making fun, too.  Of course.  As soon as, yeah, as soon as the camera stopped rolling, he's making fun.  Did you see her playing a retard?  He's making fun.  She plays a great tod, huh?  He's just playing his role on stupid morning TV.  Aw.  Ugh.  So there's awful people out there.  Yeah.  There's not a lot of them out there, though.  I know in Chicago, from what I read the other day, most people are going, ayy.  Ayy, caramba. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Very large Hispanic population in Chicago.  Second to L.A.  It's happening in every city in America.  Except one.  What?  I think West, states.  More states are becoming more diverse, I read yesterday.  Every state is becoming more diverse.  Except one, and I think it was like West Virginia or something.  Well, of course.  You, whoa, won't you keep out?  You boys stay out of here.  Was it really West Virginia?  Don't want your kind.  And it was either West Virginia or, um, Virginia. 
[00:33:30]  It was one of them.  You know the states we're talking about.  You know who you are.  Yeah.  And even if they're not completely getting as diverse as some of the northern states, you know that they're close.  You know they've got three new immigrants in one whole state.  Well, the southern states, you realize they didn't have a choice.  Yeah.  People were just coming over the borders.  They couldn't hold them back, so it has to be, it has to be those middle states that are still protecting their own.  Trying to keep people out of their rubbed borders. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, yeah.  Good luck.  Back to Karen Meyer.  Hey, I'm dressed.  You said, let us see.  Program director.  And mother of a child with down syndrome.  We have individual sessions for kids where we develop an individual program.  We make materials for them.  We adapt books that they might be reading in school to help them be more successful at school.  We just started doing a lot of small groups.  So now the kids are learning how to read in a small group setting, which is going to help them also generalize that to when they go to school, they're going to be learning in small groups. 
[00:34:30]  Can I be stupid?  Like, what good will that do?  See, now this is something you're pointing out.  It should be pointed out.  I'm asking.  And I'm sure there's parents out there right now that have one of these kids.  I'm sorry, but I'm asking.  What's the end game?  What's the end game?  A job somewhere.  Even McDonald's.  Even McDonald's or Burger King. 
[00:35:00]  It's all symbols on the register.  They don't even punch up things anymore.  Like, it's numbers, you know, that thing.  And I told a story a while back that the best service I ever got at a Burger King was by a girl with down syndrome.  Best service ever.  She knew exactly what she had to do.  Punched the keys in.  My order was up, and I was out the door in seconds.  Yeah.  There was a rock and, like, a lizard in my bag. 
[00:35:30]  But it was quick.  And that's...  No, she had...  Everything was perfect.  And it was the best service I had because they're so programmable, I guess.  I don't know.  She tried to put the hat on.  She had to, like, tape three of them together.  Wrap it around.  Well, they don't give you the attitude either, huh?  No, you're not getting mad at you either.  They're very happy to serve you.  They're a big smile.  Extremely happy to serve you.  All the time.  The place could be burning down. 
[00:36:00]  Right.  A big smile.  Have it your way.  Too bad your parents didn't.  Oh, my God.  Let's go to Chris on Long Island.  Chris, what's up?  What's going on?  I just wanted to tell you, you're all going to hell.  Yeah.  I don't know, listeners, myself included, are going with you, bro.  We know.  We're just asking the tough questions.  The questions no one really wants to address. 
[00:36:30]  If I had a waterhead baby, I would teach them how to play video games.  Yeah.  You know?  Something useful.  That would make them very, very happy.  Or point to a railroad crossing sign and say, look, that says meet Santa here.  You guys are too much, bro.  You guys are awesome.  You guys are awesome.  All right.  Well.  You ever see a story in the news that you want more detail on, but they don't give it?  There's stories about sex or some kind of story.  It's supposed to be a touching story about the handicapped. 
[00:37:00]  And there are so many questions you want to know, like, well, how do they go to the bathroom?  How do they do this?  But no one ever wants to address that kind of thing.  And you know everyone that's curious, everyone's curious about it and is running through it in their head.  The second you see somebody, like, once on Maury, I believe I saw a torso with a head.  Something happened.  There was no arms, no legs, nothing.  And they propped it up on the chair. 
[00:37:30]  And Maury, of course, gave it the, you are beautiful.  Let me tell you something.  As a person, you are beautiful.  Don't let people make fun of you.  Oh, Maury.  All right.  All right.  Shove this freak off.  Bring on the next freak.  Bring on the next freak.  Bring on the next freak.  And I just sit there wondering.  And I don't care what questions they're asking.  But no one calls Maury out on that.  It's the modern day freak show.  Yeah.  Under the guys that, you know, he's helping these people. 
[00:38:00]  P.T. Maury.  You know, the person has no arms and no legs.  So Maury, you know, after exploiting them for a half hour, then brings on a boy band to sing to them.  And that's supposed to make this person's life so much better.  And it's like not even in sync.  It wasn't even one of those, like, name ones.  And all those people are in the audience.  They're at home.  But the reality is.  I'd be clapping for you right now if she had arms.  Right.  The reality is Maury's just showing off a freak to everybody.  Freak show.  It's always that.  Because you're not allowed to do it anymore at the circuses.  It's under the guise of I'm different. 
[00:38:30]  Don't laugh at me.  I'm different.  Don't point.  Today on Maury, I'm different.  Don't point.  And then what does he do?  Put him in front of a television audience where a bunch of people can go, hey, come here.  You've got to see this.  And point.  And that's asking too much from humans in general.  Because if you walk down the streets in New York and someone has, like, a mole that's a little too big, you're staring at that.  Yeah, one of the big Aaron Neville things.  You're trying to tell us not to stare at the lady that's crawling to work on the sidewalk because she has no legs. 
[00:39:00]  Skateboard guy with the two irons in his hand going down the street because he doesn't have it.  And you wonder, like, where does that cut off from?  Just under the lungs?  Or does he have, like, a private area?  Is it just his legs?  I don't know.  I want those questions answered.  And I want to know how people with no arms or legs take care of cleaning up after they're done doing what you should do on a daily basis.  How do you clean that area up? 
[00:39:30]  You just, wow, I don't know.  You might scoot on the rug like dogs.  Just shuffle along and spoil your carpeting.  Just turn the sprinkler on out back.  Go ahead.  Clean up.  You want to hear another clip before the break?  Oh, please.  Karen Meyer, Chicago reporter.  She's deaf, teaching Down syndrome kids to read.  They learn to read family members' names first.  Nah, that's handy.  All right, we're going to start with Gigi. 
[00:40:00]  Hi.  Gigi.  Very nice.  Gigi and Jessica are three years old.  They are learning to be using pictures with type words.  We teach them to read first their name and mommy and daddy and, you know, their brothers and sisters names.  It's very highly motivating for them.  And we sort of teach them the whole program using those words.  Jessica's mom, Gail, Gina, my sister, daughter is doing great.  Mommy.  She wants to read all the time.  Her favorite pastime really is pulling out the books from her bookcase and reading. 
[00:40:30]  Allie, good pointing.  Is that her favorite pastime?  Is it after she reads it, she eats it?  Okay, terrific.  Oh, bite Mark's taking it.  Pages are falling out because stupid licked the glue and ate it.  Glue is tasty.  Give her the latest Harry Potter book and watch her head explode. 
[00:41:00]  Mondochromosomes.  Unrestrained human oddities.  Next, Mari.  Wow.  Well, we got two more clips.  I don't even know if we should play the last two.  We'll think about that as we take a break on this fine whip about Wednesday.  Yeah, Bud Light presents the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus, the comedy event of 2006, 10 days away. 
[00:41:30]  That's it?  Before we hit the PNC Bank Art Center in Jersey, August 26th.  September 9th, the Tweeter Center in the Philly area.  We're going to go down and broadcast live from WISP the day before the Philly show.  Can't wait for that.  September 23rd, Tower City Amphitheater in Cleveland, Ohio.  Yes, we're going to Cleveland.

[00:42:00]  Green eggs and ham tongue.  People are off.  I love showing my introverted fat guys.  We whip them out Wednesday.  We whip them out Wednesday.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  You ready?  Are you ready?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's spreading across America. 
[00:42:30]  You know, thanks for giving us a listen.  What's up, Ant?  Well, we were pointing out some things with some mentally handicapped people in the break we just did.  But I'd like to take this opportunity to prove that with a little alcohol, anybody can be a complete retard.  This one, I don't know.  I was 21 once.  I used to drink.  I did some things.  You used to drink? 
[00:43:00]  Maybe.  Yeah.  I used to drink a lot.  Used to?  Now an occasional wine.  Used to.  Yeah.  Used to.  Used to.  Relatively speaking, I guess.  You know something?  I'm thinking about this now and thinking there, but for the grace of God go I.  21-year-old man in Indiana suffered burns and lacerations.  Here's what he decided to do.  He was drunk at a party and I guess left over from the 4th of July, he had one of those big-ass six-inch mortars. 
[00:43:30]  Nice.  You know those things?  You have to bury a pipe in the ground, set them off, boom, and it makes an explosion like you see at Disney at their fireworks display.  What do you think this guy decided to do with it?  Okay.  Let me give you the ingredients to this disaster in the making.  One six-inch mortar, a lighter, duct tape, and a football helmet. 
[00:44:00]  He did not try.  It's not that hard.  He tried to propel himself as a rocket?  Let's just say he duct taped the mortar to the football helmet, put on the helmet, and lit it while being drunk, because why would you do this in any other state? 
[00:44:30]  Please tell me his neck snapped in half.  Well, his girlfriend said Spangler decided to duct tape the firework to a helmet, lit it.  She told police she saw a large flash, then saw Spangler on the ground unconscious, bleeding from the head.  The helmet was destroyed by the blast.  And he's being treated for lacerations.  He's still alive?  Burns, severe burns.  For now. 
[00:45:00]  Is there a picture of him?  No, I would love to see that, though.  Boy, that'll teach you.  Very, very good.  But that kind of, you know, I was ready to just rip the guy, but I remember being that age, and my brother's army buddies coming back, and they came back with this tank simulator.  Simulated the blast of a tank shell hitting, an Abrams tank shell, hitting the ground without the shrapnel and whatnot.  But the same concussion and blast.  And it was in a green canister. 
[00:45:30]  It looked like a big, thick Foster's can, but only military green.  It had some numbers on it and stuff.  And two wires like you'd attach a dry cell battery to.  So I went and got some wire from the hardware store.  The whole time, holding this thing like a beer between your legs while you drive and drink and drive back in the old days.  Holding it between my legs.  Because I thought, you know, it was just going to be like this little thing.  Got the dry cell, got some wire, went to the football field down at John Glenn with a few friends. 
[00:46:00]  Rolled the wire out, had 50 feet of wire.  Thought that was plenty.  50 feet's pretty far.  I figured I'd put one on the negative contact of the dry cell battery, make a hook with the wire, and then just drop it on the positive terminal.  Turn and run.  Get a few extra feet.  You know, running faster than electricity can travel through a wire.  Well, you didn't realize that at the time.  I was young and drunk.  You had a good plan, and it was going to work.  Young Mr. Spangler here.  Yeah.  Yeah, I had a great plan. 
[00:46:30]  So I set it all up, got ready to go.  The second that wire hit the contact on the dry cell, this thing goes off and makes a flash and a blast like I've still yet to ever see ever again.  Blew me back on my ass.  I wound up, I couldn't see for like a second or two.  And I got up counting my fingers, seeing that they were all there.  It was such a concussion.  And all my friends are laughing at me because they were sitting up on the bleachers really far away. 
[00:47:00]  They're laughing.  I thought I was a goner.  That was it.  Blew me.  What did it feel like?  It blew me back.  I'd say like 10 feet or something like that, but it wasn't that far.  It was a couple of feet back.  It just blew me flat on my ass.  I was down for the count.  Woke up shaking my head.  The thing made such a concussion.  And, you know, could have gone off in the car.  Could have gone off at any time.  Well, it was between my legs.  That would have been it.  I'd have been on Maury with the skateboard under me if I was lucky. 
[00:47:30]  You're a very special shock shock.  You were stupid back when you were a kid, but you know something?  You have potential to do something with the upper half of your body.  Do I, Maury?  Very good.  All right.  Want to go back to Karen Meyer?  There's only two clips left.  Oh, boy.  But I guess they have a great seg at the end of the story to bring it all around.  Karen Meyer, the deaf reporter up there in Chicago, teaching Down syndrome kids to read.  We've got two more clips to do here.  This group of children ranges in age from five to seven and a half. 
[00:48:00]  Best band of Dallas, Don Jacob, will be started in second grade this fall.  He started reading at two and a half.  Now it's Jacob's turn.  He's got 150 sight words in his vocabulary right now, so he can read beginning level books.  He does do math.  We've incorporated reading into his math.  We use his sight words so that when he reads a math paper, he has to look at the words,  I see two brown horses, I see one brown horse, and then how many horses all together, 
[00:48:30]  and he will actually find brown and black horses and add them together.  23 chromosomes plus 24 chromosomes equal 47.  Oh, 47 chromosomes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If we took one away, how many would you have?  That of a normal human being.  Two brown horses plus one horse equals three horses, and he points back at himself and one horse's ass. 
[00:49:00]  Don't teach him math.  It's just going to hurt.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Kentucky.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, Opie.  You and toddler tush over there missed a damn good line from Anthony.  What happened?  The P.T.  Mori line that you missed.  Oh, we've said that before.  It wasn't really a great line as much of an accurate observation. 
[00:49:30]  Anthony has used that line 100 times to the point I can't laugh at it anymore.  I know.  I didn't even want to say it, but it invites physical revulsion from everyone around.  Absolutely.  That old gag.  You know that story Anthony just told?  He told it 10 other times.  Did you hear how I was laughing like I was listening to it for the first time?  For the very first time.  That story was for you new markets.  To show what a horse's ass I was when I was a kid, but everyone else knows already. 
[00:50:00]  Wait till you get the Dreamweaver story someday.  I'm sitting there going, boy, I wonder how this is going to end.  I hope he's okay.  Maybe it'll end differently this time.  I should end it different just to mix it up.  And I blew a leg off.  This leg right here.  Maple.  All right.  Here's the outro to Karen Meyer and her fine story on teaching Down Syndrome kids to read.  This literacy program is growing.  Pairs are strongly encouraged to be part of the program. 
[00:50:30]  Nice work.  What does this say?  I've had people from Champaign that have come and spent a day and just made materials.  We actually had a woman who was going to India who had a nephew with Down Syndrome who wanted materials to bring back to him in India.  This program has been amazing in getting her the jump start that she probably can use.  And she's been blowing everybody away at school.  They were surprised that she didn't even know how to do that. 
[00:51:00]  D-D-A-N.  Very good.  Nice reading.  D-D's literacy program is free.  For more information, call 847-885-PLAY.  Well, go on our website, abc7tacago.com.  Well, look, you can.  That was such a nice thing, too.  Well, it's such a nice thing the anchors have to get in there.  Except hooking up your pizza.  Except what? 
[00:51:30]  We might have missed a great line there.  What?  What?  Except hooking up your pizza?  What the hell was that?  Is that what she said?  Go on our website, abc7tacago.com.  Well, you can.  That was such a nice thing, too.  All right, story.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Next up, perking up your pizza.  Next up.  Perking up your pizza.  Perking up your pizza.  That's it.  Great.  That shows how important her story was.  Yeah, right.  Right before the perking up your pizza story.  If your kid's a source of embarrassment, here's what you put on a pie. 
[00:52:00]  Wow.  All right.  Let's say hi to Steve in Israel.  Steve.  Oh, boy.  You guys wanted to know, you asked the question of why people that hate this program listen  to you.  Well, it is a virus.  That's no if. 
[00:52:30]  I can't stand any of you guys that haven't been able to stand you since I listened to you,  but on the other hand, I want to just give you all a big kiss, especially you, Jimmy.  Thank you.  No homo.  Atta boy.  Can't stand us, but he can't stop listening is what he's saying.  I can't stand it, but you guys are funny as hell.  I cannot.  I've never hated people as much as I hate people after listening to you guys.  You brought a whole new light to my life.  Why is it that you hate us, sir, if we make you laugh?  Well, you guys are just a-holes, you know. 
[00:53:00]  I think we're making people laugh at things they wouldn't have laughed at before, and it  bothers them, like, oh, my God, I thought I was brought up better than this.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's exactly right.  I thought I was brought up a lot better than to laugh at this kind of stuff.  Right.  It really is a fourth-grade playground mentality.  Just bullies until a bigger bully comes in and punches us in the face.  But anyway, you guys are great. 
[00:53:30]  Are you really in Israel?  Am I in Israel?  I said, I'm Steve Santani from Gaza.  No.  I'm not in Israel.  Are you hammered?  Yeah, what's wrong with you?  I'm a truck driver.  Of course.  All right, that's why you're still traveling.  My God.  Thank you, Steve.  We've got to move on.  Mike in Chicago, what's up?  Hey, I just want to compliment you guys on the show.  You guys came in with a little bit of class when you guys came to Chicago and whatnot.  Just like what's going on there. 
[00:54:00]  You guys fill in a real big void without Mancow being around, so.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks, man.  Yeah, we welcome Mancow's old listeners.  Hopefully, they'll like what they're hearing.  Thank you, Mike.  All right.  You have a good one.  All right.  Time for a sing along.  What's that point of it?  Oh, no.  What's that?  Let's start again?  Yeah, let's do it.  Okay, go ahead.  Is this Jimmy bringing us back into the show? 
[00:54:30]  God bless America.  Aw.  Aw.  Let her a little more.  Sit aside her and guide her.  Her son of the love of the above.  Sit aside her.  Yeah.  And guide her a little more.  Let her a little more.  Come on.  God bless.  God bless America. 
[00:55:00]  My home, sweet home.  God bless America.  My home, sweet home.  What a note.  That goes on the checklist as another thing you're not good at.  Got applause. 
[00:55:30]  Awkward applause.  It's a little awkward there, but.  All right.  Has that been our tribute to the handicapped?  By the way, you know, we tried to do some local, not local stuff, some current stuff.  Bruno Kirby died overnight.  Bruno Kirby.  57 years old, right?  Yeah, from leukemia.  Played Clemenza, young Clemenza in The Godfather 2.  That's right.  Hey, Vito.  Gammon in.  Steals the rug.  Remember that?  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  And he stands by the door with the gun and levels it at the door, waiting for the guy to 
[00:56:00]  come in as he's knocking on the door.  Great scene.  He was only 57 when he died.  That was The Godfather 2 in 74.  So that's 32 years ago.  How old was he?  He was 24 when he was in The Godfather?  Yeah.  Wow.  Imagine that.  Can you imagine?  Working with De Niro.  Yeah.  That.  He was in Spinal Tap.  He played the limo driver.  That's right.  That was great.  Very good.  Hey, hey.  Talking about Sammy Davis Jr.  Yeah.  And Frank Sinatra.  And they put the partition up behind him.  He's like effing limeys. 
[00:56:30]  Great little memorable part he had in that.  And Good Morning Vietnam.  He played the a-hole that was kind of running the station.  He was in the Billy Crystal movie.  Talking about his jokes.  Yeah.  He had a great career.  I think I'm going to have two of my jokes published in the Reader's Digest.  Yeah.  So Bruno Kirby dead at the age of 57 this morning.  You're kidding.  How did it happen?  Moving on, Than.  Help me out with this.  We saw this yesterday as we were leaving the program.  Jeannie Moose. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  I guess Moose, isn't it?  Jeannie Moose.  Moose.  Moose.  Is she the one from CNN?  Yeah, yeah.  She stinks.  She does like human interest little pieces for CNN.  And they're awful.  Was she on the voyeur bus?  She certainly was on the voyeur bus.  It was her.  She ratted us out.  She jumped on the voyeur bus with her CNN crew.  And she thought it was the greatest thing.  Ended in like 20 arrests.  Once again, we were really stupid.  We didn't see the big picture.  But she was on the bus filming the whole thing.  Going, wow, this is great. 
[00:57:30]  Look at all the excitement in New York that you guys have brought.  And then next thing you know, in front of the mayor's,  mansion there, whatever it's called,  she jumps out to talk to the mayor about what we were doing.  Yeah.  And blew up our spot.  You think we're publicity whores now?  Back then, I mean, we would take any kind of press without thinking twice  and without really thinking it over.  And we thought it would be a good idea because CNN wanted to join the voyeur bus,  which was a bus, a plexiglass bus, really, 
[00:58:00]  that had these naked girls living inside of it as it toured around.  And we had our own Jimmy Norton was on there,  Louis Black, a lot of the show staff was on board,  Steve C.  Had it drive down Broadway,  and CNN wanted to do a little story on it.  So they hopped on board,  not thinking that CNN might think,  you know, this is a good story,  but what would be a better story is if we cover this,  get off the bus, 
[00:58:30]  and rat them out to the mayor,  and then cover the subsequent arrests and whatever happens after that.  And that's exactly what happened.  Yeah, we have audio of Rudy Giuliani calling us stupid.  Stupid.  Mayor, what do you think about that bus that was driving up on the Opie Anthony show?  That's stupid.  That's just stupid.  Stupid.  Stupid.  That was pre-September 11th when everyone hated Giuliani.  Yeah, now he's a hero.  America's mayor.  He's now a hero to everybody.  There was a time most people hated him. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, please.  Right up until September 10th he was hated.  Well, Jeannie Moose, Moose.  It looks more like Moose.  Moose-in!  Jeannie Moose reporting human interest piece on CNN.  It's a carry-on quiz she does for everybody.  A what?  Oh.  She hits the streets of New York because of all the stuff you can't bring on flights,  so she does a piece on that.  It's all cute and fun and just flat-out dumb.  Contact lens solution.  No. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, what am I doing?  Well, there was an answer right there.  No, I know.  Jumped right into the quiz.  Here we go.  Is it okay to bring lipstick?  Will gel shoe inserts have security following in your footsteps?  Even airport employees have trouble keeping up with the latest rules.  I'm not an expert on that.  Place it in the bin when you go through.  No, no, no, no, no.  We invite you to test your knowledge.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's the carry-on quiz.  What's allowed and what's not allowed?  Bug spray.  No. 
[01:00:00]  Gel deodorant.  Sorry.  Jell-O.  No.  Lip gloss.  Lips?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  Lip gloss.  No.  Knitting needles.  For those, hmm, items, you can always check by going to the Transportation Security Administration  website where there are lists and lists, but the rationale can be confusing.  Gel cap type pills.  Not allowed.  Now they are.  All right, how about four ounces of NyQuil?  Not allowed.  That's allowed now. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, wow.  That's right.  No gel cap pills, but they just changed the rules to allow up to four ounces of non-prescription  medicine.  Oh, my God.  No gel cap pills, but you can take NyQuil?  Good.  She just lists items.  Yeah, that's her whole gig for this story.  Let me list some items.  And what about the knitting needles?  Do we ever get back to that?  We do get a ruling.  Oh, good, good.  Yeah, I can't wait.  Boy, I really wonder what the answer is there. 
[01:01:00]  It's going to have to be no.  If it's not no, I'm going to stab Jeannie Moose in the neck.  I don't know what happens to broadcasters.  You finally make it, you get this huge gig, and then you become lazy or something.  This is the best you can do?  That's it.  For CNN?  Well, they send her out.  I'm sure she has no say in the matter.  What do you think?  She wants to go to Beirut?  I think she comes up with her own ideas.  This is it?  Could be.  Contact lens solution.  No.  Well, you know, they've changed it.  It's enough to confuse even a New York City policeman. 
[01:01:30]  Knitting needles.  No.  Yeah.  Really?  Knitting needles and nail clippers are...  What?  All right.  I can understand the nail clippers.  That's always been ridiculous.  Nail clippers have always been ridiculous to be on the no-fly list.  But knitting needles?  Is there a size thing?  What if you bring in, like, knitting needles like a fencing foil?  What?  I don't know what the length requirements are.  Why am I yelling at Than about this?  This is my policy, sir. 
[01:02:00]  Because it's like you brought us the audio, so I'm blaming you for...  They can obviously do some...  For the FAA allowing knitting needles.  They can do some major...  What?  It doesn't make sense.  You can knit like handcuffs and secure the entire staff.  You can make a shawl and hang it so they can't see what you're doing in the front of the aircraft.  Right.  Very dangerous.  Knitting needles.  How about a hammer?  No.  How about a dildo?  No.  How about a bagel?  Potholders.  All right.  We get it.  Keeps going.  We get it.  Yeah.  Really?  Knitting needles and nail clippers are now allowed. 
[01:02:30]  Mascara.  Yes.  It's no.  We asked a spokesperson for...  Mascara's more dangerous than a knitting needle?  Yeah.  Oh, we do.  You could put an eye out with mascara.  Mascara.  I don't...  People putting on mascara with knitting needles.  That could be very dangerous on a plane.  Yes.  It's no.  No!  Spokesperson for the Transportation Security Administration.  What's wrong with mascara?  Why can't you take mascara?  She said we want people to look as bad as possible. 
[01:03:00]  That's cool.  That would work.  Lipstick.  No.  I hope Jeannie Moe's is a no.  Not today.  You can't bring her.  No, no, no.  Some lipsticks yes and some no.  That's correct.  Lipstick is okay.  Liquid lip gloss isn't.  Mascara, not allowed.  Wrench under seven inches, allowed.  Now, which one do you think I could do more?  A wrench under seven inches is allowed.  Well, this story's getting better now because this is ridiculous.  Can't you start slowly disassembling the aircraft with a wrench? 
[01:03:30]  Like, I know damn well I've looked under that seat, and with, like, a six-inch Crescent wrench,  I could take that seat out.  Yeah.  I could remove seats.  I think if somebody sees an arrow by the emergency exit to it with a wrench,  someone's going to go, could you not do that?  No, they're going to bring a tape measure and go, six and a half inches.  That's all right.  It's good.  It's allowed.  Wrench under seven inches, allowed.  Now, which one do you think I could do more damage with?  Lipstick.  If only it were as easy as this cartoon, another brave soldier in the war on terror, 
[01:04:00]  throwing out Chanel No. 5.  Forget Chanel.  What about shoe gels?  Shoe gels?  Get to surrender your gel inserts.  Wow.  Genie Moe, CNN.  I think those socks should not be allowed on a plane.  Oh, the SpongeBob?  New York.  Oh, wow.  Here's that cheese thing.  Socks.  I think those socks shouldn't be allowed.  Genie Moe.  Suffering suck-atash.  Genie.  You can't bring that on board.  Oh, we learned a lot there. 
[01:04:30]  She's really good.  Knitting needles was surprising, though.  Yeah, definitely.  Speaking of that, let's go to Bob in Florida.  Bob.  Hey there, babe.  Hey.  Hey, thanks, Pat Fumunaki, but they don't want her to take on knitting needles because  they don't want her to knit an Afghan.  Arr, arr, arr, arr.  Knit an Afghan.  That isn't even the...  Yeah.  Okay.  She might knit an Afghan.  Oh, Afghan.  Right.  Afghani.  It's actually a good line if he would have...  Yeah.  ...delivered it properly. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, well, that's not fair.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  George.  I mean, it's...  Oh, hold on a minute.  Let's go to George in California.  George.  Yo, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, I think it's pretty...  Out of the airline, it's not allowing knitters on the plane.  Knitters?  Nothing.  Oh, I gotcha.  You thought maybe they misunderstood.  All right, with that, we're going to take a break.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oh, boy.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America. 
[01:05:30]  Prepare to be wowed.  What?  Markers.  Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Okay, okay, fine.  Wow me.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  All right, lots of shows still to do.  It's the O.P. and Anthony program.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America on this fine Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Make sure you get the wow stickers on your car.  By the way, if you like mediocrity, my stupid Hammerstein ballroom tickets are now on sale 
[01:06:00]  on Ticketmaster, and it's for November 10th, part of the New York Comedy Festival.  They've been on sale for a few days, so sorry about the misinformation.  Get them now.  Yeah.  Now.  If you want, and if you don't, well.  Okay.  Accept that.  All right.  All right.  Quick, quick, cute little story here.  Breast implants saved woman hit by shrapnel.  Shrapnel.  In Jerusalem.  An Israeli woman's breast implant saved her life when she was wounded in a Hezbollah rocket 
[01:06:30]  attack, a hospital spokesman said yesterday.  Doctors found shrapnel embedded in the silicone implants just inches from the 24-year-old's  heart.  Oof.  She was saved from death, said a spokesman from Blah Blah Hospital in northern Israel.  I love Blah Blah Hospital.  The woman who was not identified has been released from the hospital, but there you go.  Breast implants saving a young woman in Jerusalem. 
[01:07:00]  You're going to have to check that one on Snopes when they never give like a name or any other  details.  It says AP.  It has to be true.  Oh, it says AP at the top.  Well, then it has to be true.  Absolutely has to be true.  Associated Press, of course.  Another big story today.  We got a racist senator out there.  They're calling him a racist senator.  Impossible.  Virginia senator uses racial slur for Indian man during campaign speech.  Oh, what racist slur did he use for Indian?  Hmm.  Indian man. 
[01:07:30]  Indian like India?  I don't know.  Or American?  I don't know yet.  The guy looks like an Indian from India.  Oh, that's the guy.  It's got to be dot head.  Well, that's a racial slur.  You think that's the one it is?  I thought we were trying to figure out what the slur was.  Hmm.  I say dot head.  No, I don't think a senator would use a.  Or a.  Haji.  Haji could be.  Haji.  Or a smelly. 
[01:08:00]  That might be it.  But again, I don't think a senator.  It is a senator, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't think.  Here's the story.  This fellow here over here with the yellow shirt, Makaka, or whatever his name is.  He's with my opponent.  He's following us around everywhere.  And it's just great.  The fellow Senator Allen was referring to is 20-year-old S.R. Siddharth, an American college student of Indian descent.  At least for the summer, a volunteer with the James Webb campaign.  Armed with this digital handy cam, Siddharth had been assigned to track Senator Allen all last week, a common practice among some campaigns. 
[01:08:30]  But Siddharth says it wasn't until Friday, during a speech near the Kentucky border, and with Siddharth's camera rolling, that Allen singled him out in the crowd, twice referring to him as Makaka, the scientific grouping for a type of monkey.  Okay, I never would have gotten that one. 
[01:09:00]  That's terrific.  Oh, is that a hard one to pull out of?  He was trying to be clever, man.  That's a hard one to pull out of.  Did you ever hear that before in your life?  I've heard of a macaque, but not Makaka.  Makaka.  I like that.  Twice referring to him as Makaka, the scientific grouping for a type of monkey.  And in some European countries, macaque is used as a racial slur.  So welcome. 
[01:09:30]  Let's give a welcome to Makaka here.  Oh, my God.  And the real world of Virginia.  Wow.  America and the real world of Virginia.  Is that what he's saying?  Yeah.  Whew.  Please vote for that guy.  Wow.  That's a tough one.  Once that gets some more legs and makes the rounds.  Well, this guy was bothering him, right?  Well, he's from the opposition.  So he's following him around with a video camera, just waiting for him to slip up.  And, hey, look what I brought home, boss. 
[01:10:00]  He decided to go schoolyard.  Yeah.  Even though he's a senator.  He's like, man, I've had it with this guy.  Makaka.  I was disappointed that someone like a senator of the United States.  This guy is going to take the.  Yeah.  Here's the victim.  He's got it.  Here's the victim.  He drew the foul.  The poor victim.  But he did.  Make sure you talk very serious.  Monotone would be good.  I was disappointed that someone like a senator of the United States would use something completely 
[01:10:30]  offensive.  Allen's communications director denies the senator was deliberately making a racially charged  remark.  Really?  Following CNN, the senator didn't know Siddharth's name.  He said Allen's staffers had nicknamed Siddharth Mohawk for the young man's short haircut.  And perhaps the senator was confusing that nickname.  Yeah, right.  Wow.  That's a stretch.  Yeah, it's no good.  Nice spin. 
[01:11:00]  You might want to fire your spin dog.  Yeah, that ain't working.  That ain't working, Johnny.  He thought the man's name was Mr. Noogers.  People had told him that the woman's name was Fat Cant.  He may have mispronounced.  Yeah.  Perhaps the senator was confusing that nickname when he called him Makaka. 
[01:11:30]  Later in a statement, Allen said he'd made up a nickname for Siddharth, which was in no  way intended to be racially derogatory.  I apologize if my comments affect this young man.  But Siddharth says he had introduced himself to Allen earlier that week.  And you said my name is Siddharth?  Yes.  You shook my hand.  He also is very good with names, legendarily. 
[01:12:00]  He tries very hard.  Very good with names like Steve, Bob, Pete.  Yeah, things like that.  Larry.  Hey, Bill.  Hello, Bill.  You can introduce yourself ten times to me with that name.  I'm not going to remember.  I'm never going to get it.  I call you Makaka.  I don't know.  His name is Siddharth.  Yes.  Siddharth.  You shook my hand.  Right?  Darth Vader.  He also is very good with names, legendarily.  He tries very hard to learn people's name when he's meeting them.  Siddharth? 
[01:12:30]  Siddharth.  Dark Sith.  Unbelievable.  Dave.  Darth Nukaka.  That's funny.  Hey, so I'm Hispanic, and I'll tell you what, if I lived in Romania, I'd be the first one  to vote for him.  That's funny.  I mean, that's not offensive.  That's funny.  Here's a dumb thing to say, though, when you're running for office.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When you're running for office, you really got to watch out. 
[01:13:00]  Even though, you know, you didn't think it was going to be derogatory toward him, if it's  a person of a different ethnic background than just white guy, you're in trouble no matter  what you call him, unless it's his name.  It's just the country we live in now.  I love seeing these politicians show their real side, though.  Yeah.  Because most of them are just robots.  They talk perfectly.  Hey, let's give it a hand to them.  Let's welcome them.  Yeah.  Makaka.  Makaka.  And Makaka, you little monkey.  Just showing he's human.  Old cinnamon lips. 
[01:13:30]  Come here.  I just thought he had just finished a cinnamon roll.  Right.  And I was saying a napkin may be in order.  Old cinnamon lips.  Trish in New York, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Hi.  Thank you for bringing to everyone's attention Mike Woods, because I have watched him for  a while now, because I watched Fox 5 in the morning, and he looks like a less bloated  version of The Rock. 
[01:14:00]  But now I think he's aware of the fact that you guys are calling him out, because when  they can't to him and ask him a question, the guy looks like a deer in the headlight.  Yeah.  Because he knows all eyes are waiting for what he has to say.  We were talking about that this morning in The Office.  We were watching him, and a fan was saying, he's got to be on to us, because look how  scared he looks.  Yeah.  For the new listeners, this Mike Wood guy, he's a weather guy, but they ask him those  dumb questions after, you know, whatever story they do before the weather.  They try to ad-lib with him. 
[01:14:30]  Right.  And he has nothing.  And he can't ad-lib.  And it works now.  It works now, but it's improv.  It won't work now, and it never works.  Why?  Why?  Why?  Go ahead.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  I didn't mean to interrupt you.  Just doing my job.  Go ahead.  Go.  Trish, what did you have to say?  That was it.  I just can't get over it.  It's absurd that he's just a deer in the headlights.  That was it.  And thank you for calling it out and bringing it to my attention.  Sam in Virginia, what's up? 
[01:15:00]  Hey, how are y'all?  All right, Sam.  This thing's all over the news down here, and the awesome part is the senator's talking  about running for president.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  And the big spin on it that they're going with here is when he said, welcome to America,  the kid got all upset because he's an American citizen already.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That kind of...  He said a few things that got overshadowed by the macaque line.  I love this guy.  He just ruined his political career.  He just ruined it.  Macaca.  I love this guy.  Yeah, he really did just wreck himself politically. 
[01:15:30]  You think?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Too many minorities vote, right?  Yeah.  They're the only ones that have time to vote, so of course they're voting.  Obama.  What's his name?  Obama?  Yeah, yeah.  He had a little slip up yesterday.  Barack Obama.  Or was it Obama?  Obama.  Barack Obama.  I don't know.  All the liberals loved him after one good speech at the Democratic National Convention.  That's it.  This guy should run for president.  That's shitty.  He gave a speech yesterday, I think, and it was all about global warming and the impact  that large vehicles have and how America has to cut down on its fuel consumption and 
[01:16:00]  start looking toward vehicles, different fuels, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,  blah, blah, blah.  He leaves, hops into an SUV and pulls away.  You can't do that.  You just can't do that.  He left in a big SUV.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You should leave on a bike, a mountain bike.  Leave with the, yeah.  Like a push scooter.  Anything.  Anything but an SUV. 
[01:16:30]  The worst car to drive these days.  Oh.  If you're trying to make a point.  If you're trying to make a point.  Yeah.  That's like Al Gore flying all over the place promoting his movie on global warming.  Right.  I think that jet sucks up a lot of fuel.  A little bit, a little bit.  Andy in Boston, what's up?  Hey, this same senator, like three weeks ago, he was like, there was firefighters in the airport  for the wildfires in Virginia.  Yeah.  And he walked up to them and told them they were doing an awful job, started swearing at  him and cursing at him. 
[01:17:00]  Well.  They were taking all the state's money and not putting the fires on them.  Well, you know what?  Now I don't like the senator.  That's right.  You got to support the firefighters.  Were they doing a bad job?  Yeah.  Were they doing a bad job, Andy?  Nah, nah, man.  They're like a special, like, wildfire put-out team from some other state and they flew  in there making eight bucks an hour and the guy who ran up on them in the airport screaming  at them.  Yeah.  This guy sounds like a loose cannon.  Yeah, he certainly does.  You're going to love him.  Yeah, he's a scumbag.  All right.  Thank you.  I want to see him win just to hear what he says.  Yeah, no kidding. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, what's the matter?  Why don't we vote in like piques?  Jesus, dude.  We got to vote in a real, like, nut job.  Because everyone's like, oh, that George Bush, what a nut.  I don't like him.  You know, I don't like George Bush, the way he's running things.  But some people really get at him like he's a kook.  Let's get a real nut in there to show what it's really like.  Get this guy in there.  Make it interesting.  Just offending minorities everywhere.  Slipping up his spin team trying to get out of it. 
[01:18:00]  The day after he's elected, he's like, show me that button and I'm going to push it.  Show it to me once and I'm smashing it.  Bring me the bag with the bomb buttons.  He's just wandering around trying to find a button.  Yeah.  And they're keeping it from him.  Right.  Like using excuses.  Mr. President, it was just here.  I'll talk to Bill.  He'll bring it in for you.  That would make a great sitcom.  I just.  That's the whole sitcom.  But we got to keep this away from him.  He's crazy.  I'm is still talking about us on MSNBC.  Is he?  About an hour ago.  Yeah.  We played the audio. 
[01:18:30]  And now I guess someone got back to him to tell him that we're not broadcasting from Chicago.  Isn't that great?  We're talking to each other through our programs.  That's how great our broadcasting skills are.  Even I miss thought we're broadcasting from Chicago.  Wanted to sound local yesterday.  That's right.  So now he continues on MSNBC just about 15 minutes ago.  Well, I've got the Opie and Anthony situation straight now.  What's in the Opie?  I think.  I was listening to Opie and Anthony yesterday. 
[01:19:00]  On 96.3, is it?  No.  Out of Albuquerque.  They're on in the afternoon.  The buzzard.  But they weren't in Chicago.  So people are calling them bitching at them because in Chicago they're claiming they don't sound local.  And I'm not a complete moron.  I thought they were in Chicago.  Maybe I am a moron.  But that's beside the point here. 
[01:19:30]  I'm not a complete moron.  I'm half a moron.  Is that his wife in TV?  The blonde with the cowboy head?  Looks like it.  Is it really?  Really solid.  Wow.  All right.  Here's Deidre.  I met her at the book signing.  That was her?  Yeah.  She's very nice.  She's dressed all in, like, black leather?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Damn, Imus.  Imus continues here.  Anyway, they had this deaf reporter on, Charles.  Yeah.  What?  And who's doing stuff? 
[01:20:00]  Who's doing these various stories about, you know, like the handicapped runners or something?  Are you talking like me?  Are you talking like me?  Are you talking like me?  See?  Look at this.  In the last segment, they were going, no, we would never do anything like this.  Right.  You know, I'm not even sure they should be doing this.  But then the second you get a hold of some of it.  Yeah.  You can't help yourself. 
[01:20:30]  Look at this retard.  You just can't help yourself.  We all like to think we have that filter.  Yeah.  We just don't.  You can't help yourself.  What's that?  The, um...  It's too easy to make fun of.  What's with that, uh, uh, Pete Rose haircut deal that guy's, uh, got on?  What a mongoloid.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh.  You mean?  Oh, okay.  Now we get the picture. 
[01:21:00]  No, no.  Then they had a, there was another metal retardation center.  Then, then they go to a local commercial here in Albuquerque, or in Albuquerque, for 96.3.  And it's all, it's a commercial about, I'm sorry, oh, and I couldn't hear this one.  It's on their program.  And it's a commercial, some lady does, about people who are, suffer from, and from abject  anxiety problems.  Is that what they played after us? 
[01:21:30]  Oh, you know.  Oh, boy.  All the stations go local, so I guess in Albuquerque, right after that horrific segment, they did that.  Oof.  Suffer from, and from abject anxiety problems, you know, Charles?  Right.  Like, like, and how.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It could be so debilitating.  Yes.  How you can send for this tape, and then the woman says, don't worry anymore.  Here's a number call, and, uh, there's no reason to get all bent out, you know, to stay  locked in your house and be afraid to go outside because you're freaking out, you know. 
[01:22:00]  And then you call for the tape, and you can't get through, and you start to get worried  again.  I am not sick.  Bartlett.  Yeah.  All right, I'm fine.  Yo, his wife really is.  She's really hot.  Very cute.  Yeah, they've been together a long time.  Can't be that long.  What, did you hook up with her when she was 12?  I don't know.  Yeah, she's, uh, very young.  Yeah, um, your, uh, your mommy called me and said to, uh, pick you up from school.  Yeah, just hop in.  Uh, Don.  Yeah, my name is Don. 
[01:22:30]  Just, uh, get in.  I'll drive you home.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, no, this is a, uh, uh, one of them shortcut deals I know, uh, to your house.  How old was she?  I don't know.  They've been together probably 10 years.  Nice.  Probably.  Uh, finally, the last clip from Imus this morning on MSNBC.  I guess he didn't have a, a lot of stuff to go to today.  Yeah.  Anyway, it was funny.  I thought it was funny.  They shouldn't be photographed together, though.  The picture of MSNBC keeps showing. 
[01:23:00]  No, the Opie's actually, Opie's actually better looking than that.  And Anthony.  They look like an ad for gay marriage.  Gay marriage?  What?  That's the old gag.  Gay marriage?  They look like an ad for gay marriage.  One, and two.  Anthony absolutely looks like a shoebox.  He, uh, a bummer.  I mean, it looks like he's related to a shoebox.  They, they, they're, they're yanking him out of the security lines now.  Opie.  Opie's the redhead one.  The one that I met at my book signing, right?  Yeah, he's cute. 
[01:23:30]  And he's got to get a better PR picture because he's actually adorable.  In person, he's like really, he's cute.  He's adorable.  No, but he does.  He looks crazy.  If you scroll down from that picture, I wouldn't, wouldn't be surprised they were holding hands.  Did you say that the Ironman looks better than his promo picture, Deidre?  It is 10 minutes after the hour.  Here's Charles with the news.  Good morning.  Good morning, Ironman.  Jeez, there you go.  It was that, uh, picture they took when we first started at XM. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  I, I had, ah, whatever.  I, I had the flu for the first two weeks.  I know I'm not, um, cover of Tiger Beat material, but Shoe Bomber is the other extreme.  I'm sorry.  I'm not quite as bent up as the Shoe Bomber.  Separated at birth.  Separated at birth.  Anthony and the Shoe Bomber.  I've heard the Yasa Arafat son.  Heard of that one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Maybe I should shave.  I think if I shaved, I tried that once when we went to the Hard Rock for the Beatles thing 
[01:24:30]  and, uh, people didn't like that either.  No.  I don't know what to do with myself anymore.  Like, I feel like I'm getting too old for the goatee.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It could be a billy goatee.  Do what you really want to do.  And bring it back.  The bandito mustache?  Be the guy that brings it back.  What, the Hitler mustache?  Be the guy that brings it back.  I can never single-handedly bring back the Hitler mustache.  Like we say from time to time, there were a lot of guys out there, they didn't believe  in the cause, but they knew they looked good with that mustache.  And you're talking about getting stopped at the security on the plane. 
[01:25:00]  Bring it back!  Anyone with a Hitler...  I bet there would be profiling for people with Hitler mustaches.  You could send 20 people with Hitler mustaches through.  They are all getting checked at security.  Yeah.  Guaranteed!  You get the mustache and then you just stand on your front lawn with, like, beige shorts  and no shirt and just, like, kind of water your lawn all day and just look menacing.  How about a lederhosen?  I just wear lederhosen and a Hitler mustache and just...  What's lederhosen?  It's that traditional German... 
[01:25:30]  Kind of suspender-ish thing.  You'd usually see it being worn by somebody playing some big brass instrument under a gazebo.  Okay.  That kind of thing.  And water my lawn like that and just, you know, talk to people.  Guten Tag!  By the way, Deirdre is 42.  Really?  Mm.  And speaking of homosexuality, I want to thank my friend last night.  She brought me to a play.  I went to an opening, a Broadway opening.  Uh-oh.  Broadway opening.  Yeah. 
[01:26:00]  There's plenty of those.  It was called Kiki and Something, and it's the gayest thing I've ever seen in my life.  So thank you.  It's a musical.  Gayer than the drag show we went to in Boston?  Did we go to that or we just...  We walked in and it was happening.  There was...  It was...  Everybody in the audience were homosexuals.  It was really...  Yeah.  And the couple in front was, like, one black guy and one white guy sitting in front of me.  And the part that bugged me or made me uncomfortable, it wasn't the fact I knew what they were going to do later.  It was when the black guy just put his head on the white guy's shoulder and I looked in and their hands were kind of locked in and they were holding hands. 
[01:26:30]  That's cute.  Well, it was loving, but it was just kind of, like, uncomfortable to look at.  And then I was like, why is my body betraying me as I looked down?  That's got to be...  That's got to be the right hook and then the left right after it to dear old dad.  That's a combination blow to dad. 
[01:27:00]  Poop, poop, what, what?  That's a two-fister.  Your what with who?  Right.  Let's go to Raj.  Sucking the what of a what?  Raj on Long Island, what's up?  Hello, gentlemen.  My name is Raj.  I'm a little bit offended that you guys made fun of that young Indian reporter and kind of jumped on the bandwagon.  I thought you men had a lot of integrity, but...  This is the worst fake accent ever. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, Raj, you're really horrible.  It leads me to conclude that you guys are just a bunch of white trash manatics.  Yes, that's a good point.  Anything to say about that, gentlemen?  Why don't you use your real voice, Raj?  Yeah.  Raj.  This is something Z100 would do.  You guys rock, man.  I was trying to get you guys.  You guys are great.  Keep on.  All right.  All right, Raj.  I always had suspicions my son was a...  But to bring home a...  Jesus.  I used to, you know, bring home a good-looking kid. 
[01:28:00]  Someone maybe we could all go fishing without me thinking about a big...  Going into...  God.  I used to powder his...  And now a big...  Is going...  In his...  Nothing worse than thinking of your boy.  The boy you raised since childhood.  Take him out.  Play baseball.  And now some big...  Takes his... 
[01:28:30]  And puts it in his...  And his...  And his...  Up his...  Through his...  And then...  All over his...  Do you want to powder that bottom now?  You just got to open a bag of dry cement.  Scoop something.  Just throw it on.  Anything but a...  Son's a size queen, sir.  All right.  That's really... 
[01:29:00]  Why don't we take a quick break there?  All righty.  Well, quick question for Jimmy before we go to break.  Glenn in Canada.  Glenn.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, Glenn.  I'm trying to update my Jimmy Norton DVD collection,  and I wanted to know if Lucky Louie was going to be released on DVD anytime soon.  I would say...  Let me predict.  Yes.  I don't know.  That's all I got.  I know nothing about Lucky Louie, buddy.  I wish I knew more.  We won't know until the end of August, 
[01:29:30]  which is always a good sign for a show.  I would guarantee that a DVD comes out.  Oh, that's obvious.  Absolutely.  You guys got, like, extras, bloopers, behind-the-scenes stuff?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That I want to see.  A lot of the clean stuff we had to shoot in case everyone wanted to network.  I'm watching the comeback.  I can't believe that show didn't make it.  I'm really enjoying the comeback with Vincent Kudrow.  It's so uncomfortable.  How do people not like that?  I watched that when it first came out, and I brought it up on the show, and I said,  it's a really good show because it's so cringe-inducing, and how, yeah, how did it not get picked up? 
[01:30:00]  Because she is perfect as this pathetic and, like, just embarrassing to watch her going through the motions of a has-been star trying to make a comeback.  Is that too uncomfortable for the audience, though?  I think that's what it is.  But it was great.  Did it find its audience?  No, I think not.  No, it didn't.  They canceled it.  I think there's a lot of people out there that don't like watching that uncomfortable stuff.  Oh, it was so, like, oh, oh, God, she's not doing this.  She's, like, crying on the inside and trying to keep a stiff upper lip, and it's just horrible. 
[01:30:30]  And all the inside show business people are all cut out of the molds that they belong.  And they have the writers pegged.  I mean, they're not as big.  Yeah.  I've never met writers quite as arrogant as the one guy they have in there.  Like, quite, you're not going to be that effed up to a cast member.  Right, right.  It was a little over the top, but.  A bit.  But the attitude, they can't get the attitude of the writers.  Like, the one guy who, the whole crew, like, everything, right down to, like, gaffers and stuff, all were perfect.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's exactly the way it is.  I mean, my minimal experience, you really feel bad for it. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, I know.  I don't laugh watching it, but I loved watching it.  Like, it didn't make me laugh, but it's, like, still enjoyable and everything.  Yeah, because it's different, too.  Yeah.  Dumb public didn't like.  How do you not like the comeback?  I love that show.  Yeah.  All right.  There's more than six of them.  Let's say hi to Dave in Dubbrox.  Yo, ONA, Jimmy, good morning.  Good morning, Dave.  Here we go.  How's going on with all these bleeps?  I pay my money for my XM and get in bleep, bleep, bleep.  Here we go.  Dave, please, please tell me that you get what just happened there.  Yeah.  Could you please be honest? 
[01:31:30]  I'm playing with you guys.  I got you on free FM and on XM all the time.  All right.  Thank you.  So you're not upset.  Take it easy.  Good morning, guys.  Yeah, we don't want anything bleeped, but that's the bit.  The bleeps are the bit in that case.  See, watch.  I could talk right over the bleep.  See?  No one's bleeping us.  I have a button with a bleep sound effect, so I could say things that are awful and talk  right over the bleep.  But it's funny to go, you know, you take my son, got his sucked, took his and put it. 
[01:32:00]  To me, that's funnier.  Of course it is.  Without just saying it.  All right.  We got to take a break.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Who are these two people just staring at us?  Who are they?  They look like friends.  Who are they?  Of course they are.  Who are they?  All right.  All right.  Friends of Steve.  All right.  Hello.  Kenny, why don't you plug your gig real fast before we take a break?  Headquarters of the Gentleman Cabaret tonight, 38th and 11th.  A lot of hot chicks there with good anatomy and all working parts. 
[01:32:30]  Going to give away traveling virus tickets at PNC and T-shirts and stuff.  So come have a few laughs and a couple drinks with me.  Tonight.  Use your tongue, Bertie, or in a $20 whore.  Thank you.  I'll say that again.  What?  Sound effect.  What?  38th and 11th.  Headquarters Gentleman Cabaret.  7 to 9 free admission.  Here in New York City.  Can you do lap dancing, you creepy bass slacks?  Thank you.  Should be fun.  Club Soda Kenny at a strip club. 
[01:33:00]  That's a bit waiting to happen.  He was banging cocktail wings.  Just two at a time.  All right.  Otto and George is here.  We'll continue.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Now we all know that Opie and Anthony wow stickers are your tickets to a successful whip them out Wednesday.  Well, yeah.  Did you know that wow stickers have many other uses?  I built my entire house out of wow stickers and two by fours.  Solid as a rock.  Oh, crap.  I'm not insured. 
[01:33:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA uncut and live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.

[01:34:00]  Good morning.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Let's not forget that.  Yeah, that's fun for you guys just driving around.  You get a sticker on your car and you never know.  It's one of those things you never know.  You drive around, you get the sticker, and before you know it, you drive with some girl flashes.  Just shows you.  And you go, what the hell?  Why is she doing?  Oh, that's right.  I had a wow on a vehicle.  It's easy.  It's very easy to play along.  You don't have to wait for a radio station van to pull you over.  Ooh.  Oh. 
[01:34:30]  For concert tickets to see, yes.  Wow.  Where coincidentally enough, the guy's last name is Van Driver.  Yeah, we make our contest very easy and exciting.  And it's like Whip Him Out whenever.  So if you have the wow in your car, you never know when it's going to actually happen.  But it will happen to most of you out there.  Hey, we got to say hi to Otto.  Hi, gentlemen.  Hi, Opie.  Hello, Otto.  Good evening.  And for the new listeners, of course, the puppet, George.  Ah, it's too early.  I'd like to crack your skulls open. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, he is a little feisty this early in the morning.  It was an early day today.  Yeah.  God bless you for having us on.  Dude, every day I got a deal with getting up at 5.15.  It stinks.  Yeah, really?  It's just not a comedian's lifestyle.  Yeah, we were listening.  We thought you weren't even on the show.  You're like quiet for the first hour, right?  Sometimes, yeah.  Jimmy goes into hibernation just to try to get some more energy from his sleepless night  of hookers and comedy.  Yeah, he has to wipe away the sleepies and the shame of what I did. 
[01:35:30]  That was a great Tony Danza, by the way.  Oh, wait, thanks a lot.  Thanks a lot, Dave.  Hey, thoughts and prayers to you.  Thoughts and prayers.  That guy was the king.  And I can't even take credit for it.  It was the Soup on E!  Joel McHale's show.  When he did Transitions.  Yeah.  And it was a segment where he would take Tony Danza doing his monologue during his show  and the awful transitions he would do.  He'd be like, I was out last night. 
[01:36:00]  I saw one of the best ukulele players ever.  And I mean, a ukulele's not an instrument that a lot of people play these days,  but it was some of the best ukulele playing I've ever seen.  Thoughts and prayers to Bruno Kirby.  He's dead today at 57.  You know, a great actor, a wonderful person.  I met him once.  Fantastic.  My daughter got an A on her test.  I'm very proud.  Oh, another...  Danzitions.  Bruno Kirby movie, Modern Romance with Albert Brooks. 
[01:36:30]  He's great in that one.  Modern Romance.  Yeah.  Didn't see that one.  It was like Albert Brooks' second movie.  He was one of those guys, Bruno Kirby.  You just knew him.  Yeah.  You know, every movie.  The freshman he was great in.  He was really good in just about everything he was in.  Yeah.  Where'd he die from?  Leukemia.  Leukemia.  Leukemia.  Yeah.  Most people didn't know his name, though.  It was like J.T. Walsh or guys like that.  That guy's fantastic.  He's dead, too.  I know.  You see him in everything, and you're like, who is that guy?  And you just don't, you know...  And Sling Blade?  Oh, what a creep.  Oh, yeah.  It would be a pedophile. 
[01:37:00]  What a creep he was in that.  He was a naughty one.  Yeah.  What about that boy?  Why don't you tell me?  Don't mention that boy.  Great.  I was going to see that World Trade Center with my girlfriend, Trish, and we decided it's too depressing.  We went to see that Will Ferrell movie.  Man, was that abysmal.  Really?  You didn't like that one?  God.  I felt like I got ass raped by Will Ferrell, and he sucked $20 out of my colon with his penis.  You know what I mean?  And Ali G.  Thank you. 
[01:37:30]  Thank you.  Guys, I'm killing.  Yeah, you are killing.  And Ali G guys in it, he's funny.  These are funny guys.  Yeah.  The movie had no pulse.  It sucked.  Really?  It was like, Will Ferrell was so unfunny.  It was like McMurphy after the lobotomy.  It was like that level of it.  It was really bad.  Product placement after product placement.  It was just-  That's what it's all about.  Yeah.  That's what they do now.  That's what they're making up for all the lost revenue.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Going to the film.  And on the way home, I rented the best of Will Ferrell just to see him do James Lipton. 
[01:38:00]  I was almost in tears.  Yeah.  I took a guy this talented and gave him nothing to work with.  But, you know, it really sucked.  But Money Hand Over Fist, that movie made.  Yeah.  The movie's still-  It's doing fine.  He's still doing well at the box office.  He's making quite the income.  Well, you didn't want to see-  Are you ever going to see the World Trade Center movie or no?  Yeah.  Probably on cable.  I mean, I love Oliver Stone.  He's the right director for that topic, too.  He loves that grim, depressing stuff.  I don't want to see that stuff in the theater.  Yeah.  I kind of want to be in the privacy of my own home. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  A little weepy.  You know, just in case I get a little weepy, you know, if there's anything going to get  you a little weepy, it's that subject matter.  So I want to sit there in the theater walking out.  Someone asks you, how was the movie?  And you go, you can't control the way you talk.  Yeah.  I like to-  I was saying, I'm sorry, man.  I like to watch-  I saw Flight 93.  It was one of the best films I've seen.  Yeah.  It was perfectly acted.  Yeah.  Perfectly acted.  I'm like, this is-  You don't feel like watching me acting.  Really?  The guys were actually real controllers and stuff like that they put in the movie.  With the snakes on the plane? 
[01:39:00]  Well, God, how awful is that?  I think that movie's going to do well, man.  Oh, well, it'll probably make a lot of-  Oh, God.  I was talking about this the other day.  I think it's like the new Jaws.  Like, they've been trying to figure out, besides the obvious, you know, how to scare the crap  out of people that fly.  You know, I know the terrorist thing, yes, but in general, most of us feel like we have  that under control, in my opinion, anyway.  But now they came up with this new concept, like, what, snakes on a plane?  The trailers I've seen, though, it's Jules from Pulp Fiction on the plane. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  It should be Jules Pit on the plane.  Yeah, yeah.  Because after the dead, snakes on the mother plane!  I'm going to walk to Earth and eat my brand muffin.  Yeah.  You're going to be a bum, Jules.  Yeah.  They've been talking about that movie for a really long time, so hopefully it's all  right.  Yeah, because it's a contained environment.  You can't get out of the thing and stuff.  Right, right, right.  You would think the first sign of a snake, though, perhaps they would land a plane somewhere.  Yeah, land!  Quickly land, everyone gets out, everything's fine. 
[01:40:00]  What?  Movie over.  Ten minutes.  And of course, they'd probably have to go from L.A. to New York.  It's got to be a long flight.  Long flight.  I can't believe I'm in the studio.  Wait, Otto, what's going on over there?  Otto's got some of his buddies in.  I'm so thrilled to be here.  Yeah, if they had to sit on the windowsill of the Chrysler building outside in the rain,  they would have still signed on.  He took a day off from work, Holly.  Don't pick on us.  Oh, okay.  Holly and that young, strapping Rutger Hauer boy she has with him. 
[01:40:30]  Got a white hair, very tussleable.  Yeah, Otto brought some friends.  Hey, Otto's playing Mr. Joshua from Lethal Weapon.  Oh, how perfect.  Yeah, there you go.  Your arm, please.  The most overacted scene ever by the current.  You give me your arm, Mr. Joshua.  Who was that?  I don't know.  Your guy who played Buddy Holly?  No.  Yeah, yeah.  That was Mr. Joshua.  Gary Busey.  The guy who overacted was the guy who played the Colonel.  Oh.  And the guy's going, where'd you get him from, Wackos or Us?  Which is such a bad 80s line.  Your arm, Mr. Joshua, please, your arm. 
[01:41:00]  Good evening, good evening.  Hello, Frank.  We've got to make sure everyone knows that Otto's going to be playing the Opie and Anthony  Traveling Virus.  I have you alone to thank for that.  You made it happen with one phone call.  You're welcome.  This guy was working on the Peter Lorre impression and Norton was emailing a hooker, but you made  it happen.  Good evening.  And stupid me.  I'm like, Otto, we didn't know you really wanted to be part of this.  And what did you say?  To work with all those great comics, all them talented guys. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  And Rich Floss.  Yeah.  He'll be there, too.  You're like, no, I want to play Pips for the rest of my life.  That's our low self-esteem as a show, though.  We're like, who wants to be involved with this?  Yeah, yeah.  I really was like, I don't know if Otto wants to be a part of this.  I'm an idiot.  But I don't enjoy the company of comedians, really.  I mean, all the backstage sparring.  It's really annoying.  But I'm looking forward to killing on the stage there.  Yeah.  For your sick, low-grade audience.  Oh, yeah.  You'll do fine.  It's August 26th. 
[01:42:00]  We're 10 days out, I believe.  10 days out from the big show presented by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  You can get tickets through Ticketmaster.com and all the info is up on Opie and Anthony.com.  The record-breaking show.  That's right.  Record-breaking.  I was embarrassed when Pete put out that press release.  I mean, you know, our comedian friends are great.  They're all great in their own right.  But you throw 30 of them together on one stage, of course we're going to beat Leno's record.  Record-breaking.  Shut up.  Ascato.  He's pretty honest. 
[01:42:30]  What's the Leno record?  Well, here it is.  The ONA virus sold more tickets at the PNC than any other comedy act in the history of the PNC.  It's 39 years.  Wow.  And the guy's record that we broke was Jay Leno.  And Opie's saying, well, we got like 800 comics on the bill.  Yeah.  So, you know, it's easy to break the record.  They all have a huge fan base.  I mean...  I never see comics advertised for there.  It's always Steely Dan, Ringo Starr. 
[01:43:00]  It is an all-star band.  Oh, God.  Yeah, this show's got...  It's got Otto and George on it.  It's got Voss, myself, Patrice, Bill Burr, Carlos Mencia, Tracy Morgan.  It's a great show.  Bob Saget.  It's going to be amazing.  Oh, may I say a laugh fest?  Yeah.  The first show in Worcester was great.  August 26th, PNC Bank Art Center.  That's going to be great as well.  Presented by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  There you go.  There's the second plug of the day.  Wow.  Beautiful.  Oh, my God. 
[01:43:30]  What do you guys do?  Do you just host, like, Anthony?  Yeah, we just look silly.  We host.  We look silly between comics.  Come out, introduce a couple of the comics.  Yeah.  It's not our thing.  No?  No.  Although, Ant did Andrew Dice Gay.  I do Andrew Dice Gay.  And he did kill.  They made up the jacket for me.  He did kill.  It says Dice Gay on the back.  And, yeah, it's the sunglasses.  And I come out and do rhymes.  Where's my little sheet? 
[01:44:00]  Your sheet?  I remember when you busted your lip open with the water bottle.  Oh, the water bottle.  Constantly.  I do it every time I have to do the...  Yeah.  And we make little cute videos, Otto.  Oh, yeah?  We made, like, a shower rape video.  Really?  Yeah.  That was cute.  Yeah.  It got a huge laugh.  It's on opianthony.com.  Wow.  Yeah.  It's me cowering in a shower.  In little Calvin Klein's.  That's all I'm wearing.  And just when you think it couldn't be more horrific. 
[01:44:30]  Well, should we give it away or should people...  Yeah.  We've talked about it on the air.  Jimmy comes walking in a frame completely nude.  He's completely nude.  Okay.  And he's yelling at Opie to just shut up and take it like a man.  Wow.  Yeah.  It got a huge laugh.  Yeah.  If they get a nice response, I have a very smooth, lovable ask.  You're going to be impressed.  Oh, Oz.  Oz wouldn't have aired that scene.  Yeah.  It was that bad.  We'll bring that video to the PNC as well.  We'll show the people that haven't seen it yet.  Or you can go to opianthony.com.  All right?  We're also talking about Imus today. 
[01:45:00]  Terrorists a little bit.  A racist senator.  We have a new story.  We love these stories.  They prove that there is no God.  You keep believing out there, but there is no God.  Did we ever really think there was?  These stories come about from time to time.  You got a question.  You got to question this God thing.  What horrific thing happened to a decent person?  Well.  Because that's always, you know, nothing better than when those church buses are driving down  the thruway and a boulder that was sitting there for 18 gazillion years decides, that's the 
[01:45:30]  moment I'm going to roll down the hill and wipe out these church-going people.  Right.  After they're coming back from some retreat where they, I don't know, cured some rare disease  and raised a billion dollars for hunger.  A rock that overlooked the plains as dinosaurs were walking around decides, now I'm going  to roll down the hill.  Yeah.  And pick up this 7-10 split of a bus full of religious people.  Can we all agree that we love puppies? 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  I love puppies.  Puppies are my only soft spot.  You love puppies.  You love the puggles.  Little puggles.  The cuteness meter pegs out into the red.  You can almost explode your cuteness transmission just looking at one.  And then the other day, we're doing the walk back, and a little beagle was crossing the  street with those floppy ears and the little eyes that are, they look like they're painted  by that artist that paints the sad little eyes with the little glimmer in the side. 
[01:46:30]  Just adorable.  I got a look.  And, yeah, just cute.  That's the only way to describe the little guys.  I love puppies, too.  Hitler loved puppies.  Come on.  Yeah.  The most evil guy in the world.  Yeah.  I believe.  Puppies.  I believe even Muslims love puppies.  Well, now slow down.  I desert the ether.  Put explosives in them.  Set them loose.  And we all know the Koreans really love puppies. 
[01:47:00]  Panda block.  You ever see what the Germans do with them on film?  Very impressive.  Oh, God.  Oh, what breath she must have after that.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, uh...  Dogs can fear.  Legs propped up.  So, in general, we could agree we all love puppies.  Yeah.  And, uh...  We got a little story about puppies that proves maybe, uh...  Well, maybe God's just busy.  Maybe he was tied up doing something else.  Yeah, maybe he got stuck at work.  Appointment book was full. 
[01:47:30]  Or maybe he was on vacation in the Caribbean or something.  The wife called.  What happened?  Well, listen to this.  From what we can tell from the driver, he was notified via the radio from another trucker  that there's smoke coming out the back of the rig.  He pulled over at that time and attempted to go in with a fire extinguisher.  But when he opened the doors, smoke, heat, and flames.  And behind all that, around 60 puppies, all in cages with nowhere to go and no air to breathe.  Oh, no, no, no, no survivors. 
[01:48:00]  Even for these guys who've seen a lot, this was disturbing.  We don't like to see any loss of life, you know, whether it's, uh, dogs, cats, uh, uh, yep.  We don't like it.  Those with the Lowell Humane Society are stunned by such a huge loss of life.  What a demise on a highway in a fire.  It's just, it's devastating news.  As it turns out, this company is one of the largest puppy brokers in the U.S.  Apparently what they do is they buy the dogs from commercial breeders 
[01:48:30]  and ship them off to pet stores across the country.  Fire officials say in transport, the puppies were given air conditioning.  No word yet if that A.C. unit caused the fire.  The driver of the truck not in the mood to talk about what happened.  What else could it have been?  No, you need to let, uh.  Puppy smoking?  Step back to me, please.  But the shipping company, Hunt Corporation, did release a statement saying we are all puppy lovers  and could have never imagined such a loss occurring.  There you go.  Did they have to say we are all puppy lovers?  We're all puppy lovers. 
[01:49:00]  It was an act of cruelty.  Well, I think we got us a goddamn puppy lover.  Hey, puppy lover.  Did all the puppies died?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All 60.  Tragic.  He slapped the puppy.  The puppy slapped him back.  I could have had you shot.  And the only thing that runs on power back there is the air conditioning unit to keep them clear.  We're not sure if it was the air conditioning unit that started the fire.  Was it puppies rubbing together too quickly?  Or one, yeah, smoking? 
[01:49:30]  Is there anything else that could start the fire back there?  Puppy blew itself up.  Trying to escape.  I know what it was.  It was just a mistake.  Yeah.  Like a light blue or something.  What a sad little story.  Yeah.  It just sucks.  Imagine the poor guy that's got to pull 60 charred puppies out of the back of the truck.  Yeah.  How many?  What do you got?  40.  46 puppies.  42.  Really depressed.  47 puppies.  The yelping.  Oh, it must have just sounded horrible when he opened the door and realized he couldn't 
[01:50:00]  get to the puppies.  Yeah.  You just hear him back there.  Yeah, because they're so lovable and they're like in your hands.  They just rely on you for everything.  And then just to be yelping like that and they know your face and you're not rescuing  them.  Right.  Hey, um.  And how come we never get upset about this upset?  And the story never really tugs at the heartstrings when a container truck full of illegal  aliens is found baking in the desert somewhere.  Because puppies don't do home invasions. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, because we don't all like illegal aliens.  We all love puppies.  We all love puppies.  We can all agree on that.  There isn't one person once a puppy kicked out of this country.  I don't call on my phone and it says dial one for English and two if you're a puppy.  Jason from Rye doing a pat from Munaki.  This is taking over the country.  Who doesn't like a hot dog?  It's a pet joke.  But then you got the real pat from Munaki on instant feedback. 
[01:51:00]  It was, uh, Arfwits.  Arfwits.  Oh, God, is that horrible.  It was pretty, pretty bad.  You got to call in with your jokes, though.  They're much better when you do them.  Right.  How bad are you going to be, Sonny?  Pretty goddamn bad.  Also, uh, shaky Mike from Virginia.  God would have helped, but his girlfriend hurt her foot.  Oh, inside.  Now you've had your drink.  Now tell me what all the puppy love has already seemed to know. 
[01:51:30]  They burn the puppies on the causeway.  They're dead.  They burn the cup.  Oh, God.  All right.  We should take a break.  We got Otto and George in studio.  Yeah.  Uh, are we promoting anything else there, Otto?  Vagina.  Oh, where's that stupid piece of paper?  Otto.  I'm doing this club in the film.  Otto.  Otto.  Otto.  You Philadelphians got to come out and stuff.  Is it the helium?  Where is it?  Is it the cabaret?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's it.  Joe knows.  Comedy cabaret when, sweetie?  15, 16. 
[01:52:00]  Uh, shut up, Conti.  I got it right here.  15, 16.  Ooh.  Yeah.  One show a night.  Comedy cabaret at the Best Western.  Please come down, Philadelphia.  Douchebags.  What day?  What day is tonight?  No, no.  September 15th.  Oh, September 16th.  Oh, and then the Gotham Comedy Club, September 8th at 11 o'clock.  All right.  Uh, well, website.  Oh, MySpace, Otto and George, and I'm going to have my own, uh, OttoandGeorge.com soon.  Thanks.  Nice.  Oh, look at you.  What is OttoandGeorge.com now?  Someone else has it?  I had it for a while, but I just neglected it and didn't give Craig my, my dates and stuff, 
[01:52:30]  but I'm, I'm getting it all together.  I got, I got a manager now, uh, Ben Carrizzo.  I asked him, I asked him to get me on a Jerry Lewis telethon, and he said, I couldn't get you on a telethon  if you had the disease.  Why do you hurt me, Ben Carrizzo?  What an embezzling name that sounds like.  Real shyster, right?  Ben Carrizzo at two o'clock.  Yeah.  That's really good. 
[01:53:00]  All right.  We'll continue.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  T.E.  Now we all know that Opie and Anthony Wow Stickers are your tickets to a successful Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Well, yeah.  Did you know that Wow Stickers have many other uses?  I sliced out both my kidneys, and I patched up the wounds with Wow Stickers.  But, but, dude, how do you pee?  Oh, boy.  Can't pee.  This was incredibly nearsighted.  Opie and Anthony!  Gotta go pee, can't go pee, gotta go pee, can't go pee, pee, pee, dance, pee, dance, gotta go pee. 
[01:53:30]  Opie and Anthony, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Wow is alive and well on Pal Talk this morning on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, yeah.  We got the Pal Talk cameras in studio.  Gotta love it.  If you got Pal Talk, they're not even a sponsor.  We just like what they do.  We just like, it's, um, it's pretty inexpensive.  Like, I pay for my own account.  I don't even, you know, it's something like, uh, $50 a year. 
[01:54:00]  If that's something like that.  $60 a year.  I'm not, is it $60 a year?  We should have part of the company at this point.  I know, really.  We turned a lot of people on to Pal Talk.  And it's, uh, you go to paltalk.com and you gotta sign up and everything like that.  But then you go to, uh, Opie and Anthony Live Room.  That's where everybody hangs out.  And, uh, you, you'll see, uh, cameras from the studio here.  You see cameras from our listeners.  And, uh, you get to look in and listen in, uh, when we go to break. 
[01:54:30]  I think we're the first radio show where we get to watch the listeners listen to us.  Yeah.  All of a sudden you'll, you'll see them start laughing or something.  It's really bizarre.  And then you get beautiful girls that, uh, flash us during commercial breaks and stuff.  There, here we go.  Ah, there she is.  May I say Pal Talk is sponsoring the O&A Village and is gonna be there?  What, what, what, what, what, Kenny?  Pal Talk is a sponsor of the O&A Village and the Traveling Virus Show.  And they're gonna be there promoting themselves and signing people up and, and telling everybody about Pal Talk. 
[01:55:00]  Could you lift the mic higher to your mouth instead of holding it and leaning into it?  Big dope.  It's, it's, it's a flexible thing.  And he lifts it partially, like, chest height and then leans over like a creep.  I'm big.  Yeah, Pal Talk's out.  All you gotta do is buy a camera.  Uh, well, I, I got a Logitech.  A Logitech.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, good one.  The type that you have right here.  Oh, it's this one.  Yeah, these are the, these are the good ones.  You can control them, like, make them go back and forth, up and down, remotely.  Pan down and remove your face from the shot when you're completely abusing yourself on film. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  You know what I like to do with another program that I have?  Um, when I'm on vacation, I got my laptop.  I can, uh, access my camera at home and turn it on, see if any, uh, you know, any riffraff is around my house.  Wow.  Yeah.  No matter where you are, you could, could, could, could, could.  And then what do you do?  Hey, I don't know.  Watch him.  Hey, man, what's up?  No, don't take that.  Oh, no.  Hey, look, we're on the TV.  No, not the TV.  Oh. 
[01:56:00]  You see him, and as he grabs for the computer, the camera just goes.  Wait, you can actually.  End of show.  That's great.  Yeah.  Those urban stories about a guy who went on vacation, and they come back, and then, and then there's, um, on their videotape, there's a guy in the room with the toothbrush.  Toothbrush.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You've heard those, right?  Yeah, I've heard that urban legend.  Wow.  There's ones like that where, uh, yeah, everything was stolen except the camera and the toothbrush.  Yeah.  And then, uh, they got home, developed the film.  Yeah.  And when the film came back, they saw the robbers, and they had taken the toothbrush and put it, uh, in a place in their body where you would not want a toothbrush. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  Or that.  Whatever, whatever they'll dump out of as I try to skate around it.  Oh, okay.  It's all right.  Don't worry.  I had that happen to me, actually, on a trip.  Uh.  No way.  I absolutely did.  And then I remembered.  Who did it?  Oh, yeah, I'm the one that did that with the toothbrush.  That was me.  Wow.  And it was straight.  Your own camera, your own place.  That's right.  Hired a tranny to videotape it.  Oh, straighten yourself out, Daddy.  So, uh, Pal Talk, if you, uh, you know, if you need proof that the girls wow for us, uh, get the Pal Talk cameras, because on Wednesdays, it's all about wowing. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Baby girl wears very sexy underpants.  You like her baby, uh, her, oh my God.  She wears, uh, boy shorts or something.  You with your toothbrush and your rectum, him laughing at you.  You think I'm going to let that happen to a nice girl like Trixie?  You're nuts.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hey, I thought we'd go a whole.  You can't treat Moe Green's toothbrush like that. 
[01:57:30]  Uh, Tom, you're a dentist.  You talk to him.  Oh, man.  I thought we could go a whole, uh, show without making fun of Mike Woods.  Oh, he did it again.  Mike Woods is our favorite weather guy.  He's right there on TV right now on Fox 5.  Uh, what, what the news, especially the local news in whatever city you're in does these days,  because they have to compete with, um, Fox, uh, network news, you know, the, uh, the national news and CNN. 
[01:58:00]  So they got to spice up their newscasts.  And what they're trying to do is not being such zombies and just reading teleprompters.  So the anchors talk to the sports guy who talks to the weather guy,  and they get these little impromptu, spontaneous ad-libbing conversations going.  Sometimes they're based on the story.  Yeah.  Oh, they're all pals.  Oh, yeah.  And this guy, Mike Woods, that you're looking at right up there,  the improv skills of a cinder block.  The guy cannot, yeah.  He can. 
[01:58:30]  He looks like half a rock.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everyone calls him, uh, it says he looks like the rock, only small.  Now, look at how big his fingers are.  Do you have any idea what he would do to your girlfriend if she wound up with him?  Oh, forget about it.  Stop.  Wait.  He's got long fingers.  What does that mean?  Um, it means he would do a lot of internal damage.  With his fingers or he could?  Whatever.  He could.  Yeah, not even, not just with his fingers.  I think that might be a reflection of other things.  Right.  Maybe.  How big his hands are.  Oh, God.  So, he just can't improv. 
[01:59:00]  If you got, uh, one of these dummies in your city, by the way, we need tape.  One of these dummies.  Send it in to Danny at foundrymusic.com.  You should run for Senate.  Yeah, and you could get, well, and we'll give you a prize for helping out the radio show.  So, Ken has another announcement.  Uh, God, there's a Tropicana truck outside.  What should I do?  Stupid.  So, you want to hear, uh, the latest Mike Woods story?  Well, they were playing a game called Where Are We with Mike Woods. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, great.  And, basically, they show a picture of a skyline, and Mike Woods has to guess where it is.  Now they're making him, they're quizzing him.  The guy can't even improv a question like, Mike, so what'd you do last night?  Dying.  I may.  I, night time, the day now, did.  Guy's a moron, and now they're going to quiz him.  All right.  Well, here we go.  All right, we are doing another one of, this is Mike Woods' favorite game. 
[02:00:00]  I said, Mike, we're going to play Where Is This Again with you.  And he's like, oh, no.  Mentally taxing.  You know what that means, Mike?  We're going to do it all the time.  I know it.  Where is this?  And Tony is not allowed to chime in because she probably knows.  Well, it kind of looks like Central Park West.  No.  Yes, it does kind of look like we're missing some buildings downtown.  Yeah, missing some skyscrapers.  But it could have been.  Could have been.  But it's not.  But it's a live picture.  Any idea?  All right, but I might know where it is. 
[02:00:30]  That one tall building.  Oh, yeah.  Here's a clue.  Tony might know where it is.  And the park might be close by.  Really?  You might want to park your car over there.  Oh, really?  Because it's wick awesome.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Boston-ish?  Boston-ish?  Perhaps.  How about Boston, period?  That's the John Hancock building right there.  Empty Babble.  Yay!  Come on!  Yes!  I'm not completely in that.  It only took 42 clues.  They just want to be like New York. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  That's what I get.  Hey!  Hey, now!  Hey, hey!  Give me that up!  Give me that up, my boy!  I had to go there.  I had to go there.  I know.  Mike's a good guy, but, you know, when all is said and done, he's just a stupid...  Yeah.  Jesus.  Weathermen should shut up and just talk about the weather, you know, really.  Yeah.  That's pretty much the deal with Mike.  Remember that kind of Tex Antoine?  Tex Antoine.  Remember that story?  He was the guy with the big controversy because...  I don't remember. 
[02:01:30]  This was a long time ago.  Yeah, a long time ago, he had gotten on and they had gotten through this awful news rape  story.  Yeah.  And they went right to him with the weather and him trying to ad-lib.  He said, when it gets to that point, the woman should just lay back and enjoy it.  Right.  And, ooh.  Wow.  That was...  Ooh, the letters.  This was before email.  You're fired!  Yeah, the letters came rolling in.  The whole city went ballistic on him.  Just went crazy on him.  Was it in New York?  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:02:00]  He lost his job.  He was like the most popular weather guy at that time.  He used to have Uncle Wethby.  Yeah.  That cartoon character with the big lightbulb head.  I knew you would know that story.  Oh.  He knows all this stuff.  I used to sit in front of a television from the time I was three till last night.  What year was that?  I mean, I did till now, still.  Yeah.  Till the time I was three?  No, no, no.  What year did Tex Antoine do that?  Oh, God.  That was...  Probably late 60s, maybe.  Oh, okay.  Early 70s.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Great, real smart thing to do. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  You really...  Do you think the second it came out of his mouth, he went, oh, no, I'm fired?  Probably, yeah.  Oh, Jesus, that was not the right thing to say.  And that was back before real political correctness.  You could get away with a lot back then.  He was in more trouble than the rapist at that point.  Yeah, yeah.  Tex was worse than the rapist he was commenting on.  Yeah.  All right.  One more story.  We'll try to sneak in here.  Oh, wow.  This cute little story.  Is it cute?  Oh, it's adorable.  Oh, right? 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, adorable.  It's cute.  Oh, it's chitons for you, see?  Chitons.  Yeah, they're adorable.  They're adorable.  Wise guy, eh?  Give me that rod.  Would I throw a lighted match in here if Rocky was in this stove?  It's a courageous cat.  You might, Robert.  You might.  Like, you put me in this room with an elevator.  I was trying to sleep on the elevator.  Nine-year-old Matthew Brogan has a developmental disorder, and though he has difficulty expressing 
[02:03:30]  himself, Matthew clearly describes the trauma of trying to escape from a time-out room.  His parents say, in reality, it was an elevator closet inside this Seaford Elementary School.  I was trying to get the door open.  So, right away, we were very upset as parents, really upset, because a major component of  Matthew's education is positive behavior reinforcement.  Roberta Brogan says back in November of last year, she was shocked when her son first told 
[02:04:00]  her about his experience.  Three months later, Seaford school officials finally confirmed via letter that Matthew had  been escorted to a time-out room three times for behavioral problems.  And they say they did it with somebody in the room.  Matthew tells me that that's not the case.  In fact, he tells me that the door was closed, and oftentimes all the lights were not on.  So, you know...  And there were monsters in there.  ...to try and get somebody to calm down. 
[02:04:30]  Family attorney, Ken Mollett...  Boring!  Matthew sounds like a very bad boy.  You know what?  We'll cut our losses.  They're not all going to be gems.  Matthew...  That's a who-cares story.  He's quite a naughty boy.  He needed to be corrected.  When do you think maybe we should throw Matthew in the elevator closet?  Hey, nigga, cook.  I'm Meg Car.  All right.  We'll cut our losses.  There was more to the story, but it wasn't going anywhere. 
[02:05:00]  We can be honest with ourselves there.  Tomorrow, Fat Boy Slim stopping by to hang out with us, and he's going to do the walkover  to XM and hand out his latest CD, Fat Boy Slim's Greatest Hits.  Otto and George, thank you so much.

Hi, Allie.  The little buds.  I don't like earbuds.  Hi, Allie.  Dried up, cunt. 
[02:07:00]  Sorry.  Sorry.  Isn't she your friend?  Yeah, she is.  That's sweet.  She drove me in.  No easy pass.  She's too much of a hippie.  Oh, no.  You had to wait on the cash line?  No easy pass.  Who doesn't have easy pass?  Why don't you have the easy pass, man?  Get easy pass.  Why don't you have the easy pass?  Another bill to pay.  Another bill to pay.  You're ruining everything, Holly.  I'll put it on my debit card.  Don't you see any equity in the time spent in the cash line?  Would you get me one, Anthony?  No.  Just taking pictures like crazy?  But she could clean a half an ounce of pot on a record album in 25 minutes. 
[02:07:30]  No seeds.  Clean.  No marks.  Cleanest pot.  No stems.  No seeds.  I'm trying to talk to her on the radio, and she's just taking picture after picture.  On a brain salad surgery album cover from Emerson, Lake, and Palmer.  This is not a library.  Nice head.  This is not a library.  Where's all the pretty women?  At work already. 
[02:08:00]  Sucks.  Hi.  Much cooler today.  Hope you're enjoying the blah, blah, blah.  Appetition.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Where's the old man?  Enjoying the blah, blah, blah.  What are you reading the blah, blah, blah?  Ah, Andrew.  Kenny, I'm going to kick this nun in front of the taxi.  Just get my back in case anybody tries to help her.  Greetings, Andrew.  That's Andrew.  Very nice to help him, sir.  Very nice.  How you doing there, Andrew?  I'm all right.  Doing good today?  I love him another day.  I'm happy. 
[02:08:30]  Andrew, you've got to wear a hat.  This is the first time we're seeing you without a hat.  That's why I took off my hat for you guys today.  Why?  I said I wanted to show you my real self today.  You have hair like Norman Bates.  So for you guys.  I just talked to God.  He thinks you're an asshole.  Oh, well.  God bless you, my friend.  You got another one today?  Eat something.  It's the homeless fucking Audrey Hepburn. 
[02:09:00]  What do the pennies indicate?  Are those crop circles?  I think it's because that's my lunch.  Your lunch?  My lunch.  Your Lord?  L-O-R-D.  Ever heard of a steed stick?  Yeah.  Your Lord.  All right.  So Jesus Christ is your Lord and Savior.  Jesus Christ is my Lord.  I will be born that way. 
[02:09:30]  I will be born that way.  Carabicho.  He's a demon puppet.  Yeah, he's very evil.  The power of Shent compels you.  The power of Shent compels you.  The power of Shent compels you.  Everywhere.  God loves everybody.  All your mother's content.  You know, the power of Lord is the greatest power in the world.  Really?  You got to have that power of Lord, baby.  I'm a huge Matt Damon fan. 
[02:10:00]  What the fuck is he talking about?  Andrew, you like the puppet?  His name's George.  George, the one who's swooping in Canal Street now.  El Diablo.  Boy George, who's swooping in Canal Street, doing a community service.  I don't know what he's talking about.  Boy, this guy needed shirt martinized.  He's fucked up today.  He's trying to make a Boy George joke.  Oh, I gotcha.  Because George the puppet Boy George.  Boy George.  Boy George, that was a hell of a stress there. 
[02:10:30]  Nice tie-in.  Boy George is doing community service.  We heard you the first time, Andrew.  Yeah.  Are you fucked up today?  Were you out drinking last night?  Hey, that is Texan's one.  No, I drank a couple of beers.  And I drink two beers.  I'm high for two days.  So did you have a couple of beers?  What is your heritage?  Hispanic?  I don't drink too much.  Cuban?  Once in a while.  Yeah, where are you from originally?  Biden.  Where are you from originally?  I'm originally from Goa, India. 
[02:11:00]  India.  Goa, India.  Wow.  Yeah.  Where or...  Don't you have a community?  I mean, I thought Indian people took care of each other.  You must be a real asshole.  I want to ask you a question.  Look, I'm wearing Hershey's T-shirt.  How come they don't give me no royalties?  Oh, because he's wearing a Hershey's T-shirt.  That's a good question.  He thinks because of advertising.  I should be entitled for some royalties.  The same reason you people charge $2 for a roll of Dounty. 
[02:11:30]  Fuck yourself.  I'll give you a royalty.  Dounty, $2, my friend.  All right.  This is Andrew.  What do you think, Adam?  Very nice guy.  Sweet soul.  Yeah.  Thank you, guys.  God bless you all.  God bless you, Andrew.  I don't have anything smaller than...  Enjoy Central Park.  Not going to be able to...  Stab a tourist when you get a chance.  The homeless, like, wrapping people over the head with cobblestones. 
[02:12:00]  Wow.  A homeless Indian guy.  I always thought the Indian community, like, took care of their own and shit.  Nah.  You never see a Chinese homeless.  That's true.  That's a very good point.  But you see a lot of Chinese.  Yeah.  They take care of each other.  Here's my friend.  70s porno mustache.  Nice.  Yeah.  Nice.  The mustache is coming back.  It's making a comeback.  Big porno mustache.  Sir. 
[02:12:30]  Sorry.  Wanda Sykes.  How you doing?  Amazing.  Wow.  Look at this open dress.  Wow.  Oof.  Double cock.  Look at this creep.  Creepy guy in a blazer.  Oh, my goodness.  A fool, all right.  He was a ghoul.  He was staring right ahead.  Like your children.  A ghoul.  All right.  Oh, look at that gentleman.  Taking a little picture.  That's nice.  Let's go over here and see what the officer...  Officer. 
[02:13:00]  Officer.  Hey, officer.  Don't you know...  The burglar came and threw me open window.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  God, William Frawley jogging.  Dun, dun.  Oh, the two joggers just nodded at each other as they passed each other.  Wonderful.  Wonderful.  What do you get in the cabs today, officer?  Nail in the cabs today?  Nail?  I like when you guys do the cab detail, when they make those lefts when they're not supposed 
[02:13:30]  to.  And you hear, pull it over, pull over.  Love that.  Any excuse.  Holly's got a dime bag of pot in her purse.  Officer.  Officer.  Dried up skank.  But she's your friend.  Oh, my God.  What a beautiful fucking day.  Oh, God.  Hey.  Glorious day. 
[02:14:00]  That's nice.  What a glorious day.  Wow.  He's a tall drink of water.  Hello, sir.  Oh, even taller.  Hi.  Jesus Christ, it's a giant town.  Oh, Jesus.  Holy shit, that's three in a row.  What are you coming out of?  Hey, nice hat.  I like the hat, huh?  Hey, nice hat.  Looks good on you, though.  You miserable twat licker.  Oh, look at the disaster that just walked out of the Steinway building. 
[02:14:30]  Goddamn rich cunt.  It's a piano wearing pearls.  Oh, little fat lady.  Holy Jesus.  Miss, what are you doing to stay cool besides eating everything?  I've heard of a diet?  Oh, is she turning around?  I thought she was going to come after you, Gene.  How nice of the piano store to put the spiky things so nobody can relax and they're having  a heat stroke.  That's what everyone does to the buildings. 
[02:15:00]  You can't sit anywhere outside.  They put spikes on them.  In New York City.  So you can't sit down on a...  Oh, really?  Peter Royal coming through.  Coming through.  We're allowing everybody in today.  Red blotchy head on him.  That was good.  That was fun.  I guess that's it, right?  I guess.  That guy likes you.  George chatting with the homeless gentleman was very funny.  Yeah.  All right.  Grinning nothing over there.  Fucking creepy hairdo.  Yeah.  All right.  He looks like a fat Frank Whaling.  We'll see you all tomorrow, gentlemen. 
[02:15:30]  No ladies, of course.  Big cock fest.  Yeah.  All right.  Again.  Let's travel inside.  Goodbye, sad public.  Oops.  There they go.  Otto killed on the walk over today.  He's just following us.  Well, I'll continue in a bit.  Opie and Anthony, XM202.  That sucks.  Lesbian.  I like that in a woman.  And every other kind of TV.  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay.  Huh? 
[02:16:00]  Weakens our resistance.  Dude.  To the onslaught of the communist masters of deceit.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  I can't believe it.  It's a pedophile humor.  Woo!  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  It's a bunch of idiots.  Perversion for profit.  Here it comes!  Here it comes!  The Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain. 
[02:16:30]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that fact.  It's Jim Northen.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down Syndrome children.  No, baby!  That's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[02:17:00]  Look how fast.  Look how fast.  Who needs the music?  Who needs the music?  Everybody else is stranded downstairs.  It was like perfect timing.  Walked in.  The elevator opened.  Shut right away.  No pain in the ass.  People hitting any of the other floors before he got to my floor.  I felt so special.  But then everyone cuts out and goes, takes a piss.  I try to get my urination done over there. 
[02:17:30]  CBS.  That way when I'm here, I can come right in.  Wouldn't that be the professional thing to do?  I hope he's still zipping up as I see him through the window.  You really do.  I like your dedication to the show.  You're willing to just piss and run down the hallway practically with your cock hanging out  as you're zipping up and fixing yourself.  You don't stay in the bathroom to do that stuff like buttoning and belting yourself. 
[02:18:00]  Let's be honest.  It sucks to be on the air by yourself.  Yeah.  I did it for a long time.  It's boring.  And you just start babbling and you're just looking at the door hoping someone's going to show up soon.  Filling time with drivel.  Crap.  And I drink so much water in the morning.  I take a leak before we leave for the walkover.  And as soon as the walkover is done, I take another leak.  You've got to take another leak.  Armin in Cleveland, what's up?  Good morning, fellas.  Good morning.  I wanted to let you know I just picked up the XM.  I got my Opie and Anthony tickets for Cleveland. 
[02:18:30]  And just loving everything that's going on, guys.  I'll see you soon.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Short, sweet, nice.  Yeah, we like that.  We like that a lot.  Otto, what did you think of the walkover?  I enjoyed it.  It's such a nice day.  It almost sucks to come up here, you know?  Yeah, I know.  It's kind of a nice little break, though.  Yeah.  It was a pain in the ass when they said we'd have to do two studios.  But then you think, you know, we've got to fucking break.  If something's happening out there, sometimes we're out there 20 minutes.  Yeah, you know, I'm exhausted from that walk. 
[02:19:00]  I want to sit down.  But I would love to go to the park right now, you know?  Yeah.  Maybe later.  Just wander around.  Yeah.  Watch people get assaulted.  You did make a great observation.  Because, you know, right outside the building, that's where I like to throw on my inline skates  and I skate home.  Yeah.  But you can't sit anywhere outside.  Yeah.  Because of the bums.  So we all have to suffer.  Oh, is that why?  They don't want bums there, right?  Yeah.  They don't want bums in front of their building.  So any flat surface here in New York City, they put spikes and all sorts of things to  make sure you don't sit there. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  You have to pay for the privilege just to change your skates.  That's why they sit on the fire stands, they're called.  Yeah.  Like the pipes that come out of the ground.  Right, right.  Sometimes they'll throw a spike on one of those.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They really don't like the homeless.  Why do we have to suffer, though?  Yeah.  All right.  We got lots to do on this half of the show.  Let's go to Jeff in Idaho.  Jeff, what's up?  I was just calling to remind you you got to play for us the last N.E.W. segment and 
[02:20:00]  the Remember ONA from Ron and Fez.  Oh, yeah.  Where are those CDs?  They're not in front of me yet.  I'm glad you reminded me because I forgot and they're not in front of me, so we'll get  those, all right?  All right.  Later.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Oh, no.  It's all this pussy outside.  What am I doing here?  I feel like a good ass rape.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Oh, where is it?  Let's see.  What?  Penis not dumped out?  Holy shit.  That is. 
[02:20:30]  We would have had a clean show at Free FM today if Otto didn't come in today.  What?  Rectum is a bad word?  Wow.  Six dumps.  All Otto.  Nigger cook?  Wait, wait, wait.  No, we do a whole thing.  Nigger's not a curse.  Hold on.  We got to get the compliment.  We got to get the thing.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, the Daily Dump Report.  Well, folks, here it is.  Notice no dumps before 816.  God, I'm sorry.  No, we like that. 
[02:21:00]  Trust me, Otto.  We like that.  When Otto said, I felt like I got ass raped.  Talking about going to see Will Ferrell's movie.  I felt like I got ass raped.  Yeah, for some reason you could say rape.  You could kind of talk about rape, but you can't say where or who was raped and things  like that.  Specifics.  Right.  That's where they get you now.  It's dumb.  Boy, no more than seconds later, the minute didn't even change. 
[02:21:30]  It's 816 still.  Pulled $20 out of my colon with his penis.  I believe the implication of the penis being in the colon is ass fucking.  No, but it's not entering.  It's exiting.  Well, you got a point.  I thought they would like that.  We'll take that to court and see how it holds up.  Yeah, we'll have a meeting after the show.  We'll try to fight for that one.  At 845, say goodbye to your shit as they walk out. 
[02:22:00]  Otto and George talking about Anthony and his surveillance cameras.  Yeah, shit's a no-no.  Yeah.  A minute later at 846, we have a rectal.  Otto and George, after Anthony was trying to talk around the issue of where they were  putting the toothbrush.  See, I had geared up.  You could say rectal.  Yeah.  You could say the man went for a rectal exam.  Okay.  He was having rectal problems.  But because I had already prefaced it with the toothbrush being shoved in somewhere, when 
[02:22:30]  you then told that it was the rectum.  Ass raped with a toothbrush would probably not be good either.  Right.  Ass raped with a shitty toothbrush.  Oh, man.  And then, again, not even a minute later, still 846, you with a toothbrush in your rectum.  And then one of my favorites at 854, the last dump of the day, a nigger cook.  Oh.  Coming from, of course, coming from, of course, the great movie, The Shining.  That should not have been dumped. 
[02:23:00]  No.  You with a toothbrush in your rectum, it should say in parentheses, delivered as Jackie Gleason.  Yeah.  Because I do such horrible things.  At least give you some credit.  Yeah.  At least there's some humor there.  Yeah.  I remember Alice.  I think it should be all right.  You brought up Alice.  God.  Now it's Lonnie Otto.  Nice girl.  I trick see him laughing at you.  You got to keep us honest, Otto.  And you did this morning.  The nigger cook line is from The Shining.  The only reason they dump out of that isn't because of FCC violations or anything.  They're just afraid of backlash and advertisers and things like that. 
[02:23:30]  So that's why that word.  Yeah, we lost that word.  That's not an FCC word where they have a problem with it.  It's a company policy.  Yeah, but your black listeners, they don't date that thin skin.  Why do you pluralize that?  Oh.  Our black listener.  They say that word like the these days.  I know.  No, it's that double standard thing that's ridiculous.  You go to the hip-hop station, tell them they can't say that word.  It'd be dead air.  I know.  Dead air.  Too true.  Oh, did I make it?  Too true.  Wait, that sounded good. 
[02:24:00]  I think I made that.  My day.  I thought I shot the basket there into the garbage.  What's this Metamucil do for you?  Makes you shit.  Is that what it does?  You should be shitting anyway.  I do shit.  Naturally.  I mean, why do you feel like you're clogged up?  Do you eat a lot of red meat?  No, why?  Oh, I don't know.  I shit twice a day.  Really?  Yeah.  Whether you need it or not.  I took a massive, like, fluffy dump when I got home yesterday.  Fluffy?  Yeah, it was, like, thick.  There was no substance to it at all. 
[02:24:30]  I want to like pudding.  But a little solidified.  Yeah, like more solid than pudding.  If it was on your chest, it would just be a fucking warm pile that did move, but not fast.  We interrupt this program to bring you the ozone midget sighting of the day.  Hey, Rob, what do you got today?  Who saw that?  I got a midget sighting.  All right.  It looked to be a brother and sister, possibly twins, Asian, which I've never seen before. 
[02:25:00]  Now really, how can you tell?  Walking down the street with their handler out of Northwestern train station in Chicago.  What do you mean their handler?  Another person, possibly a mother, but they were, they looked to be like mid-20s or so.  Yeah.  Anyway, I've never seen an Asian midget before, so.  I've seen those.  They were actually walking with, like, a valid person, though.  Yeah, a real person.  A valid person. 
[02:25:30]  An actual human being.  And that's all you got on that?  That's all I got.  Hey, Jimmy.  Go ahead, man.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  All right, let's go to Bob in Philly.  Hey, Bob, what's up?  Hey there, Bob.  Yeah, listen, uh, hey, Opie, you're running down the hallway tucking your dick away.  When did you wash your hands?  Uh, he doesn't wash it.  I don't wash my hands after I take, uh, a piss.  Oh, and he's eating blueberries right now. 
[02:26:00]  I don't know about that.  I think you're going to the bathroom too much with Jimmy.  Your penis is much cleaner than your hands.  Yeah, unless you're waving your hand in front of the stream of piss, why do you need to wash up?  Stupid.  Well, go over and shut hands with Anthony.  See what he says.  No, no, no.  You kidding me?  Most people don't wash their hands after taking them.  I wash.  Yeah.  I wash my hands.  You scrub.  Scrub, Tina.  Scrub, Tina.  All right. 
[02:26:30]  What is it now, guys?  All right.  Bye-bye.  That keeps you from getting, uh, colds too.  What?  Because you don't want to be crazy wash your hands guy.  Because that's like, you know, be like a lunatic.  But if you, if you wash your hands after you take a piss, it's not just the fact that you're, you're taking a piss and washing your hands.  But it's throughout the day, you're cleaning your hands.  I'll tell you why you should wash your hands.  All right.  I take a shower every morning.  My penis is clean.  No one has touched.  I'm, I'm, I'm the first person touching my freaking penis.  Yeah.  Yeah, but no one wants. 
[02:27:00]  I'll tell you why, though.  What's more dirty is when you're pulling the handles and stuff.  So that's probably why you should wash.  Yeah.  But not because you touched your own penis.  No, at a common courtesy to other people.  Oh, really?  You're touching your penis.  You see what half these people do before they shake your hand?  But then it's like.  They're picking their nose.  They're picking their ear.  But it's hand job.  They're picking shit out of their teeth.  And then like, hey, nice to meet you.  And those are the women.  I add nothing to this show.  That's not true.  You were killed.  Will you stop?  It's the planet you add nothing to. 
[02:27:30]  The show you're very funny on.  Oh, you mother's cunt, Ben.  You're kidding.  I'm kidding, Dolly.  Carl, I'll bring something.  Something happened here.  Get us a drink.  You bums get involved with her.  Make you cry.  It's like a hand job by proxy, though.  You know?  No.  You're one.  It's one degree of separation from your dick.  Stop.  When someone shakes your hand.  It's no big deal.  If you don't wash.  It's no big deal. 
[02:28:00]  It's like when they leave that fifth of the top of the paper around a straw when they bring  you your beverage.  Like it's a little condom for the straw.  Yeah.  So no bus fumes.  A homeless spit will get on your straw before it gets to you.  Meanwhile, they touch the part that now went in your drink.  Yeah.  Wall of hell.  Just give me the straw wrapped in paper.  Yeah.  Too early.  What does that mean to...  I have mashed potatoes.  Hey, um...  Too early.  Yeah.  Look at Ali.  We got a couple of really quick clips from Flavor of Love season two. 
[02:28:30]  We mentioned this when we were talking to Flavor Flav on the phone the other day.  The Flav.  There's a wigger chick.  You watch this show there, Otto?  Yeah.  It's like the ghetto prom.  It's like the ghetto dating game.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've seen it.  It's like the ghetto bachelorette, actually.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  And they got this one white girl.  They have a few white girls in the house, but they got this one white girl.  She's a wigger.  Yeah.  But now they're starting to say that she might be just, you know, putting on an act because  she has to talk over the top black.  She's as white as can be. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  White as can be.  Of course it's an act.  Nobody really talks like that.  You're instructed, you know.  Even black people.  Black people should talk like this.  Hello.  How are you?  I'm fine.  How are you?  All that other shit is just a masquerade like they're all rappers or something.  It's bullshit.  All hardcore hip hop.  Yo.  It's bullshit.  Yo, B.  Or something, you know, like that.  Yeah.  Why should you be shocked when a black guy talks like he's not a savage and he's like,  you know, an educated, civilized person?  That's like a shock. 
[02:29:30]  You go, wow, that guy just sounded like a human being.  People are.  Yeah.  Remember that?  Like Colin Powell.  Yeah.  When he first got some popularity there, people were like, he's so well-spoken.  Yeah.  Wow.  Look at that.  And they were amazed.  Yeah.  Because he was like, yo, we're going to fuck them up and shit.  Yeah, because he doesn't have to grab his dick to make a point, you know.  Yeah.  Yo, we go into that country, buck, buck.  That's right, son.  Let me tell you what I'm going to do, partner.  Yeah.  Yeah, partner. 
[02:30:00]  It's true.  We got to back up a second.  Jim at West Palm.  Jim.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I'm in West Palm.  Okay.  I wanted to ask Coppy if he thinks it's okay that the guy that cooks his dinner in a restaurant  doesn't wash his hands after he goes to the bathroom.  Yeah.  Would you go to Poppy's Restaurant from Seinfeld?  I don't want to know what the cooks are doing.  Poppy.  But those guys are doing a lot worse.  They're spitting in your food because you're sending it back.  I don't send it back.  They're doing snot rockets into your food and mixing it into the sauce.  They're picking scabs.  That's all a lot worse than if they just touch their clean dick before they come to your burger. 
[02:30:30]  If you think too much about it, you'll never eat out again.  You'll never eat out again.  Yeah.  I'm never going to eat out again.  That's right.  Hey, you guys said you were coming to West Palm.  I heard you say you were...  Yeah, we were lying.  No, we're not lying.  Oh, shit.  Teasing, of course.  What, for the comedy show?  Whatever.  I, you know...  Yeah, the comedy show is going to have to wait until next summer, but...  Here's when we'll be visiting West Palm.  January 4th.  Right.  When it gets cold here in New York, we will be doing our show from West Palm for a long time. 
[02:31:00]  Right.  We want to camp out in West Palm for like a week.  I want a condo.  We tried to do this last year.  It didn't work.  Because we didn't have a place to go.  We had no place to go.  I got no place to go.  You can stay in my house.  No problem.  We're going to try to work it out again this year.  Only if you hang yourself after swallowing an engagement ring.  Stupid Oki.  All right, Jim.  All right, guys.  Appreciate it. 
[02:31:30]  All right.  Maybe XM could figure that out for us.  I would love to.  This year.  A couple years, I'll be department manager.  Things are going to be tough for a while.  You and Mom are going to get along great.  I wanted a pie.  Kill it.  An aviator.  An aviator.  Great movie.  What a bunch of laughs.  She was lovely.  Okay, so Flavor of Love, the wigger chick.  This is worth playing.  Her name is Buck Wild.  Of course it is.  Flavor Flav.  Is she attractive?  She's, uh, she's all right. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, no.  Nothing doing.  This one fucks niggas.  Oh, my God.  Look at them taking me serious.  All right.  Well, here we go.  Make you cry.  Here's Buck Wild on Flavor of Love season two.  I have to win this.  Flav is meant for me.  Like, none of these other girls even come to my level.  That's my flame.  I'm going to sit down with you, and we're going to get us hot. 
[02:32:30]  Damn, boy.  Ghetto is as ghetto does, but where I live in the ghetto, it's not too many white girls  up in there being all ghetto like that, so I can't really figure out whether that shit  is real or not.  You are definitely very aggressive.  I try, you know.  I got to get what I want, and apparently that's you.  And one thing I like about you, you ain't afraid of who the fuck you are.  No, but hey, we're crazy.  So the other ghetto chicks are on to the white girl acting. 
[02:33:00]  They're all black and shit.  Oh, they're calling her out on it?  Yeah, they're like, what?  And then they asked her where she's from, and it turns out it's not even really a ghetto.  Yeah.  It's kind of like a, you know.  Greenwich?  A basic suburb.  I think outside San Diego or something like that.  San Diego.  We got more.  Now this is Flav's romantic date with Buck Wild, the white chick.  Roses is red, even though I'm wearing blue.  But for half the hour, I'll drink every drop of this water for you. 
[02:33:30]  Damn.  I like Buck Wild.  I ain't gonna lie.  Wait till I throw my girl in the water.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, man.  That's cool.  I'm down.  You gonna throw me in the water?  I can swim.  Just let me take my Pumas off first, because they brand new kids.  My Puma.  I'm trying to mess them up for real.  See, she's like a country buck.  I know you don't want me to open that up.  We out in the water.  I was feeling her spirit.  Do I do it right?  Do you do it right?  All day and night.  All day and night.  Fucking macacca. 
[02:34:00]  Her father has co-workers he has to make eye contact with.  Oh, really?  That blade wants to fuck white chicks as a black cunt looks like a fucking wallet.  Thank you, George.  Ah, give me a rod.  Ah, master.  That's a courageous cat.  That little prick, minute mouse.  And finally...  He can fight all the flavor flavors and Tommy Gennaro's in the world. 
[02:34:30]  Finally, we get this sad.  It's sad what the culture's become.  I mean, I've been to San Diego, to Rancho Cucamonga.  That's where I live.  You live in Rancho Cucamonga?  That's my hood, girl.  That's my hood.  Then she lived in Rancho Cucamonga.  And I was like, girl, I've been out there.  That ain't no ghetto.  It's not.  Where I live at Jersey City is Liberty Park, man.  You can get Timberlands on the corner at Martin Luther King Boulevard.  I'm having a hard time seeing that buck while it's ghetto, like she's acting like she's ghetto. 
[02:35:00]  You love where you come from.  That's it.  You got to have love for where you come from.  You can't be ghetto if you ain't from the ghetto.  All right?  You can't redo that.  And to me, it feels like it's redone.  I like my ghetto.  There you go.  So they're on tour.  And believe me, you could be ghetto if you weren't born or raised in the ghetto.  All she's got to do is go out with black guys.  You see on Maury or the other shows, every so often, the big fat white chick with the  bleach blonde hair comes out and the black guy. 
[02:35:30]  And she's just talking.  You shut your eyes.  You think she was doing the real person?  But it's an act.  It's not real.  It's a conscious impersonation.  Yeah.  Unless you're from that area.  Yeah.  Then it's different.  Eminem, I think, is pretty real about what he does and how he talks.  You think?  Yeah, absolutely.  Are you really?  Absolutely.  He's too good to not be.  You can't make that up and be the best in that game.  I know when he's rapping, he's got it.  No, I ain't finished yet, yo.  Oh.  That was good, right?  Yo, step off.  See how fast I can lapse into it? 
[02:36:00]  Step off.  Oh, yo, man.  Leave him alone.  Oh.  I tried that.  Dude, I give myself the douche chills.  I remember high school.  My fucking Shalto Adidas with fat lasers and glasses.  Yeah.  Nice look.  Nerd.  Really?  Oh, what a nerd.  You went for the black thing, but it was Urkel.  I don't think that Jimmy was trying to do.  I was a fucking nerd with burgundy fucking pants.  What were you trying to do? 
[02:36:30]  I just humiliate myself, which I did well.  Oh.  Trying to be like hip-hop.  Were you trying to sleep with a black woman or something?  No.  It was...  But that was when, like...  At least that would have some kind of dignity to it.  That was when hip-hop first started, like, rap, you know, like, from...  It was, like, around 86, started, like, bleeding into suburbs.  Yeah.  So I thought it was, like, rebellious.  Oh.  But it wasn't.  I was just a little cock-faced.  Is that before you found heavy metal?  Was your...  No, no.  I love metal, too.  You did?  That was just a phase I went through for, like, a year, and then I'd get out of it.  Oh, okay.  Forget what happened. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, I quit drinking.  Something happened.  Yeah, something happened.  Speaking of metal...  Uh-oh.  Jesus.  Got it right here.  Did you see the list?  No, not yet.  It's not my metal.  The list that was obviously written by Jimmy Norton.  Holy shit.  It's the list of the top, like, hundred heavy metal albums, is it?  Yeah, yeah.  Heavy metal albums.  Oh, I don't...  All right, well.  And...  That always spoils the bit.  It is...  What?  Giving it out?  Well, they guess.  How many did you list?  We did top 20s. 
[02:37:30]  Top 20.  I looked at the top 10 online last night.  I just swore it was you.  Top 20 of metal albums of all time?  Yeah.  I swore Jimmy wrote it.  All right, let's see.  Mm-hmm.  Led Zeppelin, Led Zeppelin, Led Zeppelin.  Yeah.  Come on, you gotta give them all to him.  Wait, let me get...  Not in any kind of order.  Yeah.  Metallica, Master of Pop, let's get me.  Do I have one?  In top 20.  It has to be.  There you go.  Is it in here? 
[02:38:00]  Right there, right there.  Ooh.  Metallica.  Oh, it is hot.  Master of Puppets.  We're looking at top 20 here.  Yeah.  Yep.  15th.  Yep.  Appetite for Destruction, Guns N' Roses.  And Murray.  And Murray.  No Guns N' Roses.  Wow, really?  Not in the top 20.  Destroyer, Kiss.  Oh.  Nope.  Wow.  No Kiss.  So you're willing to say you hate this list?  No.  Okay.  Not at all.  I'm sure it's very open-minded and good. 
[02:38:30]  Um, all right, let's see.  Alan Sherman, My Son to Folk Singer.  All right, that's my next yes.  Okay.  Pat Boone, A Clit for the Palestinians.  Um, how about Ozzy Osbourne, Blizzard of Oz?  No.  You will not find that in the top 20.  But there is an Ozzy album in the top 20.  This is top 20 all time or just last week?  All time.  All time.  Black Sabbath, Paranoid, obviously has to be in there. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  Um, we can pretty much end the list there.  Yep.  Mm-hmm.  All right, there goes that bit.  I knew that feeling that would be number one.  Number one.  Yeah, it should be.  Who's number one?  Black Sabbath, Paranoid for heavy metal.  Is there any more Sabbath in the top 20?  Any more Sabbath?  Well, let's see.  Black Sabbath.  Don't tell me, don't tell me, don't tell me.  How many more?  At least three more.  Three more?  Okay.  In the top 20, at least, yeah.  Master Reality, Volume 4.  Obviously, Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath has to be up there.  Uh, yep. 
[02:39:30]  Volume 4 is, uh, number 20.  What about Led Zeppelin?  Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath.  Fourth.  Yeah.  Master Reality, seven.  Okay, any more Sabbath or no?  Oh, keep going.  There's more Sabbath?  Oh, yeah.  One more.  Um, well...  And one Ozzy.  All right, hold on, let me think.  For Ozzy, I already guessed Dire of Mad Men.  That's no good?  No, you guessed...  No, I did Blizzard and then I said Diary.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Uh, 19th, uh, place.  Okay, and let's see Sabbath.  Hold on, I'm going over the, uh...  It's, obviously, it's going to be Black Sabbath.  Let's see, uh...  It's going to have to be, uh... 
[02:40:00]  It's Black Sabbath.  Yep.  Number 11.  And you got number 8?  Yeah, you got number 8.  Oh, no.  Oh, I didn't even see that one.  Another one.  Yeah.  Holy shit!  Another Sabbath album?  One, two, three, four...  Yeah, there's five in the top 11.  Hmm.  Five in the top 11.  I'm going to go crazy and guess Heaven and Hell.  Number 8.  You got them all.  There it is.  Uh, in 12th place, Corrosion of Conformity, Deliverance.  I loved that album, actually.  Yeah, it was a good one.  And they didn't... 
[02:40:30]  They never matched that success, unfortunately.  No.  Any Slayer?  Uh, Slayer, Rain and Blood.  Rain and Blood.  10th place.  Uh, number 6, Season.  Seasons in the Abyss.  Uh, King Diamond and Knife with Them.  Oh.  We did the...  Number 2, Megadeth, Rust and Peace.  Right.  Like, one Metallica?  Iron Maiden, Peace of Mind.  Number 1, Led Zeppelin.  They don't really have any metal.  I mean, I think...  Really?  The Nazis?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's more rock?  Yeah, it's like really hard rock.  They kind of just missed... 
[02:41:00]  They have just...  I thought they invented fucking metal.  I listed.  Zeppelin's a great fan, though, but I mean, I just...  And the only one we didn't mention, Iron Maiden, uh, Power Slave in 5th place.  Wow, not number of the beast.  You probably want to read that because he tells, like, why and everything like that.  It's finally a list Jimmy will agree with.  Yeah, I do, actually.  Well, I think more Metallica should have been up there.  Well, Pete has, uh, Observation, too, in Observation.  Pete, what's up?  Hey, hey, uh, on that list, there has to be Jethro Tull, right?  Well, they did win the first, uh, annual, what? 
[02:41:30]  When, when the, uh, Grammys?  The Grammy or whatever?  I mean, how can they not be on the list?  The Grammys, when they started their metal category?  Right.  And Jethro Tull won the first one.  Wow.  That's how out of touch the fucking Grammy judges were.  That's as brave as a guy.  You do know that the flute is made out of metal.  Mm.  All right.  And it could weigh something.  Punch it out.  Thank you, Pete.  Let's go to Bobby in Jersey.  Bobby.  What's up, Bob?  I hate to bring you guys back, but, Opie, don't you own a restaurant?  Well, my brother, yeah, I'm an owner. 
[02:42:00]  I'm a silent owner.  My brother runs the place, FH Riley's, 400 New York Avenue in Huntington Village.  Nice plug, right?  Yeah.  Um, no, honestly, all his cooks, they have to wear those plastic, uh, cooking gloves.  That's good.  I like seeing that.  Whatever they're called.  I like seeing that.  I like seeing that, too.  Every time they prepare a meal, they throw a glove on their hands.  Didn't that used to be called Fast Eddie's House of Trichinosis?  Fast Eddie's is down the street.  We didn't go into that, uh, into that haunted bar. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, you remember him?  Oh, God.  We used to be like, every month, a month together.  Oh, man.  Stupid lips.  Always moist.  He's your father-in-law or something?  My sister's father-in-law.  I see him every weekend.  He's got a new magic trick to show us all.  Does he still have a toupee that looks like a fucking, it's nothing to describe it.  A welcome mat.  Yeah.  Fluff and nutter on top of a chef salad.  Speaking of the restaurant, someone overnight emailed us about, uh, Master Poe is the master 
[02:43:00]  of ceremonies at FH Riley's Friday.  Yes, gentlemen.  This thing doesn't need to be plugged.  It's like, almost like, uh, you know, the whack baggers are doing some kind of wedding  reception.  It's not even an ONA event.  Well, I guess it's an ONA event, kinda.  But where's the disc?  Like, of the promo or something?  He has it over there.  What is this about?  Serrano's got the disc!  Serrano's got the disc!  That'd be in a fucking heart with a pencil. 
[02:43:30]  Wow!  Midnight Run!  Nice!  He Rock!  Sure.  What do you got?  He's suffering from fistophobia.  You don't get on a fucking plane.  Uh, this promo...  Great movie.  Wait, wait, wait.  Yeah.  Par...  What?  Stop.  He Rock.  He Rock.  Go.  He Rock's the only person I know that would look better with a toupee than, than in his  regular hair.  This is like the fourth haircut.  It's awful.  No it isn't.  Yeah it is.  You should cut your hair with a shotgun. 
[02:44:00]  Otto.  Yeah.  Enjoy.  That's real hair.  Huh.  What?  That's real hair.  Oh, his hair?  Yeah.  That's not a toupee.  Doesn't it look like those commercials?  You can swim.  You can play tennis.  Maury's wigs don't come off.  He's too young to be bald.  What?  Everybody thought that was a wig?  We knew it wasn't, but it's just...  It just looks like one.  Oh, yeah.  You can screw with it.  It's a little spiky thing.  Yeah.  Sorry, Rocky.  I can't help myself.  I want my money, Maury. 
[02:44:30]  What do you got with this Master Poe thing?  Apparently some fans met helping out Master Poe build his school and they go to FH Riley's  and stuff like that and now they just got married so they're having like a late wedding  reception slash party at FH Riley's this weekend and Poe insisted on writing and recording  the promo himself.  You may give the bride a spinning back kick.  Wait, he did not?  Yes.  He insisted on writing it? 
[02:45:00]  Yep.  Okay.  Is it a promo we're running on the channel?  As of yesterday afternoon, yes.  Beforehand, let me strap in.  I don't use the seat belt on my seat very often.  Lock the door because he could kill us.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, live reading.  Oh, wait.  It's not recorded yet?  No, it's recorded.  Oh, Danny says yes it is.  Spinning back kick.  Yeah.  All right, let's play this.  O&A Party Rockers!  This is Master Poe inviting everyone down to FH Riley's to celebrate Mike and... 
[02:45:30]  Stop!  You can't use our Benny Hill music.  We use that for horrific stuff.  Well.  Well.  Well, all right.  Good point.  All right, start over here.  O&A Party Rockers!  This is Master Poe inviting everyone down to FH Riley's to celebrate Mike and Heather Smith's  wedding reception.  Come and join the best...  I can't hear myself.  Testing one, two.  Oh, now I could.  O&A Party Rockers!  This is Master Poe inviting everyone down to FH Riley's to celebrate Mike and Heather Smith's 
[02:46:00]  wedding reception.  Come enjoy the...  Come enjoy...  You can cut it any which way you want.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't have to...  Okay, cool.  I'll just go right there.  Come and enjoy the best food and drink on Long Island and...  Come and enjoy the best food and drink in Long Island and experience the time of your life.  This is going to be an all-out bash to end your summer right.  We will eat, drink, dance, and sing all night long.  That's right.  After that's right.  That's right. 
[02:46:30]  It's another great time at FH Riley's.  It's karaoke night.  The best, the loudest, the biggest bash you'll ever know.  FH Riley is located 400 New York Avenue, Huntington, New York for reservations called  631-271-7600.  This Friday, the 18th, 8 p.m.  Be there.  Wasn't bad.  I mean, with the exception of the best party you'll know, it should have been phrased better,  but aside from that and the fourth grade reading level, I mean, it was actually just  he speaks very well, posed very clear when he talks.  A lot of energy.  Yeah.  I mean, it wasn't nearly as bad as I was hoping it would be. 
[02:47:00]  And the Benny Hill music works.  Yeah.  Yeah, because it stops.  Right.  And it kicks back in.  It certainly works.  It does work.  All right.  Well, God bless.  Impressive promo.  Tell the happy couple I'd say hi, but I'm going to be vacationing.  Yeah.  We'd say more, but you could kill all of us with one dropkick, so I think it's terrific.  He could actually, before I even know what's happened, pull the straw out of the smoothie  I'm drinking and plunge it into my neck and kill me with the straw.  He's an animal.  And then he'd shove it back in there and you'd take a last sip as you died. 
[02:47:30]  No, worse.  As things just go dark, he's smiling, drinking the rest of the smoothie.  Yeah, with the lid off, like a man drinks a smoothie as opposed to you.  No straw.  He just killed me with it.  Sip, sip, sip.  You don't drink through a weapon?  Of course you don't.  Wow.  All right.  Thank you, Paul.  You're welcome, guys.  We'll take a break.  Otto and George in-house today.  Playing the ONA Traveling Virus at the PNC Arts Center, August 26th.  I'm really looking forward to that, and I appreciate it. 
[02:48:00]  It's not just the $75 that you're paying me for the performance.  It's the thrill of being there on that stage.  Well, you were a last-minute ad.  Some of the greatest comics.  It's going to be great.  People can come, man.  It was a lot of fun.  First one was great, and we worked out some of the little bugs, and I think this show  is going to just be just off the hook.  Yo.  Wow.  I thought a black guy was sitting there for a second.  Yeah, thanks.  Thank you.  I turned around, and it's Opie.  Thank you.  You'd think it was the real people.  Thanks.  I appreciate it, guys.  Opie and Anthony are the latest shock jocks to hit it big. 
[02:48:30]  Goddamn!  They are heavily into one thing.  Boobies.  Boobies.  Yes.  One of you, I don't know which one, said, then you can pull out your business.  It's junk.  We're artists.  You present it as innocent, but I'm not so sure it is.  Screw you.  We're artists.  Is there anything you won't do for ratings?  We are publicity whorebags, publicity sluts.  We're artists.  This is all about money.  That's what it comes down to.  But you're mercenaries.  That's clever.  Aren't you mercenaries?  We're radio mercenaries, dickhead.  We're artists.  We're entertainers. 
[02:49:00]  We're not psychologists.  We're not doctors.  We're not daycare workers.  We're artists.  So it's all on appearance, none on you.  None on us.  We're artists.  None on us.  We're an industry.  I'm scared.  I'm scared.  Look, Dr. Smith.  Let's say hi to Brian in Dallas. 
[02:49:30]  What's up, Brian?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Brian.  Hey, Brian.  I just wanted to know if, since y'all are going to be on vacation,  is Jimmy going to be promoting his gig at the Addison Improv, 972-404-8501?  When am I there? I don't even know.  The August 31st, September 1st, and 2nd.  Okay, yeah, I'm doing Houston this weekend, 
[02:50:00]  and I'm back for the Traveling Virus show next week from Saturday.  Tomorrow, Friday, Saturday, I'm in Houston at the Improv,  and then the Traveling Virus, I guess, and then Dallas.  If you're in New York, November 10th.  You've got a lot of new fans down here in Dallas.  Thank you, buddy.  I've been listening to y'all since you got on XM.  All right, Brian.  Hammerstein Ballroom, November 10th, Ticketmaster now,  if you want to come see me then.  It's the only New York show I'm doing.  Where's that? Where's the Hammerstein Ballroom?  It's on the west side. It's like 34th Street.  It is?  Yeah.  Oh, I know where that is.  Yeah.  That's a nice place.  Yeah, I love it.  All right, who's this from New York? 
[02:50:30]  No name here.  Hi, this is Jason.  Hey, Jason.  Welcome aboard, Jason.  How are you?  It's cool to welcome you guys back.  I went to you over a little over a year.  I just never had a chance to give you guys a call.  I always listen to you when I drive into work.  Ah, from your lips to God's ears.  But, Jimmy, I love you still a nut.  I like you guys.  Oh, and A, you always make me laugh.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, thanks.  Oh, man.  Anyways, I'm getting ready to pack my cruise from Red Hook.  I'm going on the ship that tilted 90 degrees.  Oh, go ahead.  I'm going to hang on to the bow of the ship. 
[02:51:00]  Go down.  Hey, be safe.  Well.  Oh, man.  All kidding aside, be safe.  Hey, thoughts and prayers, okay?  Thoughts and prayers.  Jackass.  Yeah.  You guys are funny, and I always listen to you, and you guys are the greatest.  Thank you.  You've slathered enough.  You'll be joining Red Button shortly.  Yes.  Hope you're killed under the rudder.  Who never got an autopsy.  Dude, my girlfriend will kill me.  What are you kidding me?  Yeah, I'm going to be engaged to her getting married next year.  If I do anything, she'll kill me.  Hey, enjoy that little lucky lady. 
[02:51:30]  God bless.  God bless.  She's very strong-willed.  By the way, Opie, you had me laughing a couple days ago about a kick in the cunt, and there  was a song about it.  I mean, I had a pullover.  I was crying.  I was hearing that.  That's great.  You mentioned something I made you laugh by.  I just pushed a button.  Oh, dude.  Thanks.  It's a button.  Well, you pushed the right button.  I pushed the right button, and there was a fine song.  A kick in the cunt.  Great.  Oh, God.  I mean, I was in the car wash getting my car clean, and I was just laughing, and then I 
[02:52:00]  had a pullover.  I'm glad my button pushing makes you laugh.  I really appreciate that.  How do you pullover in the car wash?  That's a good point.  I don't raise a good point.  That's great.  You enjoyed that song?  Oh, kidding me?  I was laughing all the way home.  What was your favorite part of that song?  I think my favorite part was just in general the whole song and everything like that, and then  Jimmy was yelling at that girl saying, shut up.  It's still your whiff.  I wanted to steal your whiff, but Ovi has to do the second half.  I didn't know.  I'm sorry.  Wait, dude.  I'm sorry. 
[02:52:30]  Here's my question.  I really thought he might have a good answer.  Here's my question.  It's stupid me.  I'm thinking, wait.  We might learn something today.  You've been a fan for a year on XM.  Do you listen on Terrestrial?  And what is it you like about the XM show as opposed to the Terrestrial show?  Well, the Terrestrial show, I mean, it's...  He's not doing it.  He's hanging us out to dry.  Yeah.  But, I mean, XM, you guys are a little more raunch here than XM.  Yeah, yeah.  We're really trying.  All right.  Show us how it's done.  Come on.  You've got to do it. 
[02:53:00]  It's too predictable.  No, no.  It's too predictable.  Now you've got to do it, though.  You're talking as long as you want, sir.  What are you doing, Dallas, son?  No, he's in New York.  Oh, I'm at New York.  What do I do?  Well, I work for the city.  I'll leave it at that.  Best just leave it at that, son.  I'll leave it at that.  I got you.  I got you.  Best response to that question I ever got.  I said to somebody, what do you do?  And he goes, if I tell you, I'll have to kill you.  We'd laugh.  Oh, because that's a funny line.  Oh, I couldn't end it. 
[02:53:30]  We just laughed.  What do you do?  All right.  I was looking at you guys.  When you guys got kicked off the sex with Sam,  I called you guys up that day  about what happened to that guy and everything.  People replayed.  He said you couldn't replay  because you didn't know what happened.  But I was looking to you that day  when that whole incident happened  and everything like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What were you doing?  I was in Long Island.  I was driving to my girlfriend's house.  Oh, wow.  I was off that day,  and I was listening to you guys  with sex with Sam and said,  oh, no, these guys are going to get kicked off. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, you were pretty observant, huh?  LOL.  Anyway, let me go  because I've got to finish packing.  All right.  Well, damn.  All right.  Have a good cruise.  Godspeed.  Have a safe trip.  You're going to find your dog dead in the hallway.  Barry.  Let's go to Mel.  Your mother.  Mel in Dallas.  Hey, Mel.  Good morning, guys.  How are y'all?  Okay, Mel.  Mel, Jesus.  Come on.  Hi, y'all.  We can handle this. 
[02:54:30]  Stole it.  Don't that make you sad?  Hi, Jimmy.  We're thinking about coming to see you in Houston.  We've already got tickets to the...  Early.  Yeah.  Are you going to be doing any new material,  and I want to bring you a birthday gift, too.  You're fucking prescient now.  When's the last time you saw me?  The pressure's on.  I have not seen you.  My boyfriend's actually seen you.  So why would you need new material  if you'd never seen him?  They already got tickets to the same shit.  He's not going to be doing, you know,  fucking Nixon jokes, but... 
[02:55:00]  What kind of pressure is that?  I actually have a...  It'll seem definitely new to you.  Are you going to be driving a new tractor?  What the fuck are you giving the pressure for?  Zach is great.  First time, tenth time.  I will be doing some new stuff.  Thank you.  It's been a while.  I've been in Houston.  It's hard, though, when you come through a city like every...  You know, if you just come back in, man,  it can be a motherfucker,  because they expect, like, a new half hour  to go here a month ago.  But, yeah, I haven't been in Houston in a couple years, so...  Houston.  Well, what would you like from Texas?  Because I'd love to bring you a gift. 
[02:55:30]  Bring a...  Open a box.  There should be a head with an open mouth  that I can put my dick in.  And then...  I think I could work that out.  Really?  Well, you could just show up  with a little box taped around your head,  and we can laugh about it after.  All right.  All right.  We can do that.  I want my dick sucked.  That's what I want.  All right.  Thank you, Mel.  My delicious cock.  All right.  My shaved...  As that massage therapist called it,  my meat stick.  I want my...  She was taking my cock one time  and slapping it against her hand,  and she goes,  Oh, I love this big meat stick. 
[02:56:00]  Wow.  That's a compliment.  Oh, that doesn't...  Really?  Meat stick?  Yeah.  They just say,  whatever hits your heart.  Yeah.  That's why I'm...  You should shave your balls  and spray some Febreze on that.  How about if I was just really literal?  Oh, Anna, that would hurt.  You sting?  You have a rash.  I hate that.  Are you going to do any new material?  It's like,  well, you know,  why don't you just slap a new ending  onto Blazing Saddles  if you're so unhappy with perfection?  Your act is perfect as it is.  She wants a new fucking hunk. 
[02:56:30]  All right.  Let's say hi to Brian in Jersey.  Brian?  Hey, Owen, hey.  Jimmy, what's up?  What's up, Brian?  Hey, a guy I work with  has the little doggy station,  the piece of shit that he is.  And Howard's got a new commercial  out on Sirius that says,  for us to survive,  we must kill the virus.  Figured these guys  like to know about that.  Good luck.  Preaching to the converted over there.  Yeah, I know.  You know, it's like, 
[02:57:00]  what the fuck?  The guy thinks, you know,  he's going to kill you guys?  It ain't going to happen.  It just shows how scared he is.  Can we confirm this?  Because we don't have  the little doggy company.  Best example I ever heard  of something like that was,  wow, I just lost my thought.  I mean, literally,  my thought just stopped  in mid-thought.  I lost it.  Right out the,  there it is, out the window.  Oh, go get it.  Go get it.  And someone's picking up  with a pooper scooper  as they should have.  We need more info on this, Brian.  All right, I'll see  what I can find for you. 
[02:57:30]  I'm punching out for now, gentlemen.  Oh, about telling people  who already know.  I was telling somebody  this something one time  and they said,  you're preaching to the choir.  I'm like, I make a lot of sense  because the choir already knows  what you're telling.  They would know.  Why would you look at them  and tell them they know?  Why preach?  Yeah, it's just like  a whole waste of breath thing now.  Let's say hi to Jimmy and Dallas.  Jimmy.  Honest.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, I was wondering,  are y'all just going to  fucking rant and rave all day  or y'all actually going  to talk about something?  Probably rant and rave all day,  so tune in tomorrow.  That's true.  Oh, really?  Oh, and also,  Jimmy is going to be 
[02:58:00]  at the Edison Improv  August 31st,  September 1st,  September 2nd.  Thank you, sir.  I'll be ranting and raving.  I'm a ranting type comic.  I just rant.  Oh, we've already got our tickets,  Bubba.  There's about 12 of us going.  All right, thank you.  That's probably spread out  over three nights.  There's only 12 I have there.  Jimmy.  Yeah.  Are you liking today's show  and you just used that  to get through,  to plug Jimmy?  Just more or less  use that to get through.  Oh, okay.  Your screeners are nothing  but a bunch of dicks anyway.  Oh, you're not as content.  Our screeners are dicks.  We know it.  All right, let's go to 
[02:58:30]  Scott in Alabama.  Competent Derek  and sweet, soft,  touchable Travis.  Scott.  Yeah, guys,  are y'all going to play  the Ron and Fez clips  you say you're going to play today?  We had a problem  with Ron and Fez recently.  I've got a plethora  of hillbillies calling me.  Where the fuck am I?  A plethora is a great word.  Fucking y'all.  George, hold the mirror.  It's waking George up, though.  He's not happy.  Y'all got any new material?  Fucking filthy hayseed Jew-hater. 
[02:59:00]  Fuck them all.  Fuck America.  Catch cancer.  Phil in Jersey.  Phil.  Phil.  What's up, Phil?  Yo, yo, what's up, guys?  Sorry.  Hey, looking forward  to the showdown  in the PNC.  It should be awesome  for sure.  Yeah, we can.  Hey, Jimmy.  Jimmy, I just wanted  to tell you, man.  Lucky Louie this week.  Fucking dude.  It rocked.  Thank you, Phil.  Funny as hell.  Appreciate it.  I was wondering  if you guys could play  that clip when Jim explains  where he came from.  Yeah. 
[02:59:30]  I'm going to play it  on Free FM beeped.  There's something about  that I really like.  I'd want you out, guys.  Godspeed.  Yeah.  We can play it here  and then play it tomorrow  because what we got here  is the English-Spanish thing.  I like that.  We can do that  and then we can play  the other thing  over there tomorrow.  You tell me  what you want to do.  You get Jimmy's lines  and then you get to hear  the Spanish-HBO version.  Or you want to just wait  and play that over there  and then we'll play  this over here.  I would say go  Uncensored first 
[03:00:00]  on CBS  and then people  could hear the juxtapositions.  All right.  We'll do it tomorrow.  Remind us on the other show  and we'll do it tomorrow.  I promise.  Fan might disagree.  Fan?  Thought?  The juxtaposition, Fan.  Or you could play  Uncensored today  and then people will know  what you're saying tomorrow  when they hear it.  Yeah.  If they've  left or listened.  Go on.  Hurt me.  I'm an easy target.  Another way to look at it though.  We'll just do it tomorrow.  We'll figure it out tomorrow.  What are we playing now? 
[03:00:30]  Huh?  What are we playing now?  Oh, we got plenty of stuff.  I know,  but I want to hear something now.  All right.  Well,  local news drops the F-bomb.  No.  CBS station airs  raw footage  of on-scene reporter  instead of the actual piece.  Oops.  So I guess they were  practicing their piece,  whatever.  Yeah,  that happens.  Something went wrong,  they said fuck,  and then they played  that version  instead of the real version,  I guess.  Wasn't Arthur Chan,  was it?  No.  That's not the reporter's  fault either. 
[03:01:00]  So let's see what this is all about.  A fire at a home  in Petersburg.  A couple was inside  that home at the time.  Apparently the husband  made it out unharmed.  The wife could not.  Our Tim Trudeau  is in Petersburg  with tonight's top story.  Tim.  Here on Morton Street,  you can see the extent  of the damage inside.  Now, of course,  this house has bars  all over it,  and that was a major factor  for firefighters  as they tried to get  in for earlier tonight.  I can't fucking talk to you.  All right,  ready when you are.  Three, two, one. 
[03:01:30]  On this rainy and cold night,  Petersburg...  Obviously,  we're having some problems there.  We do apologize for that.  What you saw there  was raw, unedited tape.  We'll try to get  more of that story  to you in just a little bit.  All right,  who gets fired?  You can't fire the reporter.  Is that Norton Street  they were on, by the way?  Or Morton Street?  Morton.  I don't know.  I don't think  you could fire the reporter.  They taped it,  taking a couple of takes,  I guess,  and were supposed to use  one of them  during that little tape piece.  They were supposed to use...  And instead,  they used the one  that they weren't supposed 
[03:02:00]  to use where he fucked up.  Yeah, someone  that you don't even know  will get fired.  So it's in some back room  somewhere.  Well, maybe he was live.  He was told he was live  and he didn't know it.  Maybe he was told  you're going live  and...  Oh, no,  because there's a producer  going through too long.  Yeah, it's kind of  a taped thing, yeah.  Oh, boy.  I want to know why.  That you got to give  to some guy in a room  that's supposed to  get the correct  take fired.  Fired.  So fired.  I can't fucking talk here. 
[03:02:30]  We can say it.  Where's the video  for people to check out?  Come and get one  in the Yobbles.  Oh, Gorilla Mask.  Nice.  GorillaMask.net  is another great website.  Video well.  Video well, little brother.  Video well.  Here's the guy doing it.  We got the videotape here  from GorillaMaskHitTurnaround.net.  Where is this, by the way?  CBS where?  CBS 6.  Sam.  It's wherever it's 6.  That narrows it down.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[03:03:00]  Rob Cardwell  and Stephanie Rockin'.  Is she rockin'?  Or rochin'.  I don't know.  Maybe rochin'.  It's very generic.  Who knows?  Newscast.  And then they go  to the story.  There he is.  He's pointing out  out of the fire.  Little microphone.  It's raining.  He trips over a word.  And then he drops  the F-bomb.  Fuck, I can't talk.  And now a 3-2-1  for take two.  They go back  to the anchor.  Oh, wow.  Oh, my God. 
[03:03:30]  The anchor guy  is freaking out.  Wait, can you  just push it back  a little bit?  He freaked out  when they went back  to him.  Oh, wow.  Look, he's hyperventilating.  He's hyperventilating.  Am I fired?  I worked my whole  career to get  to Mobile, Alabama.  Shit.  What did he get yelled at?  I'm fired.  Wow.  He's thinking  his job's on the line.  He is losing it.  Oh, and she's  just looking down.  No reaction.  I wasn't even  in the fucking room.  Look, I...  I didn't know. 
[03:04:00]  I didn't say  you were in the tape.  Imagine if he said  something really embarrassing  like, I gotta redo this  and then I gotta go  fuck a child.  Oh, it's from Richmond.  Okay, thank you.  Wow, did that anchor  lose it when...  That's the funniest  part of that thing  is when they go  back to the anchor.  Yeah, check it out  on GorillaMask.net.  All right.  Let's say hi to Eric  in New Jersey.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, Otto,  you ever gonna send me  that fucking  telecrappies tape  or what?  Who says?  Eric.  This is Eric from Jersey.  I met you 
[03:04:30]  with the Bananas  over in Hasbrook Heights  and I asked you  for the tape.  You said you were  gonna mail me  the telecrappies,  you fuck.  Yeah, fuck.  Um, yeah, I mean,  I could still send you  a copy if you're nice.  I mean, yeah, I mean,  I probably promised  it was an empty promise.  Norton's...  Otto makes more  false promises  than the fucking Bible.  Whenever you meet...  This is what Otto  would do.  For years I've noticed this.  He'd meet somebody  and he just wants  to get away from them  and he'd go,  okay, okay,  and he would just nod  and then he puts out  a stiff hand  that kind of bends 
[03:05:00]  it so stiff he goes,  we'll have lunch.  Okay, take care.  And it's never  gonna come to fruition.  He wants that tape.  He probably loaned it out.  Somebody, you know,  lends it out  and they never get it back.  I understand.  Um, I don't know.  How do I get his address?  He doesn't want to give it  on the air, right?  Hold on the line.  You gotta give your address  to Derek.  I like how he goes,  I want the tape,  you fuck,  and then you go,  I'll do it if you're nice.  He's already gotten past  being nice.  Yeah, yeah.  No, but he's right, though.  I probably said,  man, I'll mail it, 
[03:05:30]  like, tomorrow  and then I get...  I'll get it right  out in the mail for you.  Yeah.  You gotta get a picture  of the handshake  because the hand comes out  straight and stiff.  Okay.  He stiffs shake  and the hand bends.  Like, if his right hand  comes out,  the hand bends backwards  because it's so stiff.  It is.  And it's such an insincere motion.  Okay, we'll have lunch.  Okay.  As you become  more and more famous,  you already are famous,  but as you become  more and more famous,  you're gonna need  to be able to just  completely blow people off  because what are you  gonna gain by talking  to most of these people?  Nothing.  I'm not saying I'm not...  You're so bitter. 
[03:06:00]  I love it.  Nothing.  I don't even...  This is what we have  to look forward to.  I don't disagree.  This is our future.  I love it.  Nothing.  They have nothing to bring.  What are you gonna say?  You rocked on Lucky Louie  last night.  You rocked.  Fuck everyone,  but please come to my show.  Fucking hot on.  I don't disagree.  Catch cancer!  But I try to disguise  my phoniness better.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm a complete phony.  Someone called me out  in L.A. too,  this comedian.  You know,  it's like that whole thing 
[03:06:30]  with Mel Gibson.  It's like everybody  basically hates Jews.  At least he has the balls  to say it out loud  and not fucking...  Yeah.  The chutzpah.  Yeah.  Moxie chutzpah,  whatever.  Wow.  Let's go to Dave in Iowa.  Dave?  I was just wondering  why XM shits on you guys  so bad.  They really shit on us.  I don't think they should.  No, XM rocks.  I was the best guy  when I bought my XM radio  and they sent me a deal  saying welcome to the family  and they got all their  talk shows listed.  Yeah.  And you guys are one face 
[03:07:00]  above the and more.  Hey, we're on there.  Oprah and Ellen.  Yeah, but they're all  before you guys  and you guys are the best.  Yeah, I mean,  they were hiding us  for a while.  It's been almost two years  and well...  I've never even heard  fucking Ellen or Oprah  or any of the...  Ann Morris.  There's a couple guys  in the middle of it.  They were hiding us  at first.  They've been hiding us  for a long time.  We're honest with ourselves.  We understand  when we got hired,  we got hired pretty much  so we wouldn't get hired  anywhere else.  I don't think we were really... 
[03:07:30]  They really knew  what they were hiring.  I don't think they were  familiar with the program  that much.  They had no idea  about the show  or what it was capable  of doing, unfortunately.  So they just figured,  ah, well, we'll hire them.  And I gotta say it,  until Eric Logan came aboard.  If Eric Logan didn't,  you know, get hired by XM,  we were fucked.  I'll be completely,  completely honest.  And I mean it  when I say completely honest.  Yes.  Yeah, it would have been  a bad thing.  We were fucked.  It's been two years  and you're the greatest  out there now  and you're still  just above Ann Moore.  I don't get it.  Thank you, ma'am.  They give us, um,  like a half second  in their XM spot. 
[03:08:00]  That's pretty cool.  The thing with Eric Logan  is he gets the show.  We never allowed the fact  that he's a homosexual  to interfere with  our relationship with him.  No, why should we?  Ha!  All right, you guys are great.  Thanks a lot.  All right, Dave.  Let's go to Peter.  That's not a real badge.  I'm telling.  Peter.  Yo.  Hey there, Peter.  It's Skeeter.  Whatever.  Hey, Otto,  I met you at some club  in Lindhurst a few years ago. 
[03:08:30]  You called it  a hole in the wall  with chairs?  Yeah.  And you came in late  and the guy,  the promoter,  I forget his name,  he was like,  you want to meet Otto?  I was like,  yeah, I'll meet him.  And then you came in the door  and he's like,  hey, there's his Otto.  And he just looked at me  and walked away.  In Lindhurst?  Yeah, in Lindhurst.  You just walked away.  It was so uncomfortable.  And then I went  into the bathroom  after your set  and I saw the guy  in the bathroom  that introduced me to you  and I go,  hey, that Otto  is a really ungrateful bastard. 
[03:09:00]  Right.  And you walked out  of the stall  after I said it.  Uh-huh.  I heard everything  I said about you.  Do you remember that?  Then what happened?  He just,  I just,  he just looked at me.  No, no, no, no,  but I mean  after you said that.  That was it.  No, no, no,  you're missing something, dude.  I called him a grateful bastard.  He walked away.  I got you, Jimmy.  You suck.  See ya.  I love Otto for that.  All right.  Then what happened?  Indy Mike.  Yes, sir.  I just heard somebody  call in talking about  XM not being very grateful  for having you guys on. 
[03:09:30]  Well, they're sort of showing,  well, are they though?  They, uh,  I have no idea.  I heard we're on  their website today,  so that's kind of nice.  Hey, there you go.  They gave us a day  on the front page  of their website.  Thank you.  That's kind of nice.  But I did notice  all the CBS stations  have had us on there  for the last 120 days straight,  but XM gave us a day today,  so I guess we should  be grateful today.  It was about a month ago  or so that I heard 
[03:10:00]  Willie Nelson  talking about Hank's place  changing over to Willie's place,  and the first thought  that crossed my mind  was, wait a minute,  they talked about  how they couldn't change  high voltage  to something like the virus  because it would be  so much cost  to change all the promotions  and everything,  and yet, gee,  they seem to do it  for Willie,  so I wanted to look at you.  Here's the bottom line.  I think eventually they will.  I think if we want it  badly enough,  the name brand  of Opie and Anthony  should be the channel name,  and it should have been  since day one,  but in all honesty,  they did not want  the name Opie and Anthony  on packaging. 
[03:10:30]  They felt it was controversial.  They didn't know  what kind of a fallout  there would be,  and that's as truthful  as we can be about it.  I don't think now  it's about that.  I don't think now  they would have  a problem with that.  I think they will  change the name  if the show  really wants them  to change the name.  You've got to pick your battles.  We gave up on that one  a long time ago.  We hate the name  High Voltage.  We've been saying it  since day one.  It means nothing to us.  High Voltage.  No one shopping  for an XM  would see that  and go,  oh yeah,  that's an Opie and Anthony.  Nobody.  The name means nothing  on so many levels.  It was a lawyer  that chose the name.  High Voltage. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  There was a lawyer.  She was coming up  from Washington  just before our press conference.  It's like Danger Zone.  Which is about two years ago  to right around this time.  Yeah.  And she's like,  guys,  we need to name the channel.  Think about it.  And I and Jimmy  and everybody else  were thinking about,  you know,  what can we call this thing?  She comes into the press room  for our press conference  and goes,  we're going to call it  High Voltage.  Yeah.  And I look at her like,  what?  And it was already  in the press release  and everything.  It was way too late.  I'm like,  what does that even mean?  Yeah.  And she was going off  the whole angle  of shock jocks  with shocking High Voltage. 
[03:11:30]  It's stupid.  It's cliche.  It's so cliche.  I told them.  And easy.  Just too easy.  It should be  Cunt Farts.  Yeah.  That would be a good.  Janice's fucking  Cunt in Hamden.  All right.  Well,  thank you,  Indy Mike.  But we gave up  on that one a while ago.  Sonny Farrelly  from Boston.  What's up,  Sonny?  Hey,  guys.  What's happening?  Hey,  Jimmy.  I got to tell you,  the other day  when that newcomer  called in  and asked for you  some advice  about drinking  and Lady Di  was on the other line 
[03:12:00]  and you kept on  switching over  back and forth,  I'll tell you something.  All my 12-step buddies,  they're fucking,  they're on the fucking ground  laughing their asses off.  And they want me  to actually take that bit  and they want me  to play it  at a 12-step meeting.  I wouldn't suggest it.  It's too dirty, man.  No, no,  I'm fucking serious.  It's so unbelievable.  It's something that  the transmission line  between,  you know,  a lot of drunks  get that,  you know?  Well,  it's fucking unbelievable,  man.  You fucking rock, 
[03:12:30]  Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  That's the first clip  in a long time  we've put up  on opianthony.com,  so it's up there  to listen to  whenever you want.  Thanks, sonny.  See you, son.  What?  What?  God, God, God.  I'm on a fucking cell phone.  Yeah,  I'm fucking punching out.  Bye.  All right.  Punching out.  Wait,  what is that?  Why are they all  so punching out?  They're all so radio hip.  It's just a term.  It's a term  that no one knows  how to use properly.  Yeah,  but as soon as they  get hip to a term  like that, 
[03:13:00]  you should immediately  stop using it yourself  and have another one.  We've said that.  Yeah.  We've said that before, too.  Yeah.  Guys,  we got a bid  from Mark Chernoff,  so this has got  to be terrific.  Uh-oh.  What is this?  He's the program director  over at Free FM  here in New York City.  Yes.  Over at the other joint  when we do  the first half  of the show  and this is  Inetta,  the mood setter,  quitting live on the air.  Who's that?  After six years  of being a part-time  on-air personality 
[03:13:30]  at WBLX  in Mobile, Alabama,  Inetta,  the mood setter,  setter,  exits WBLX  with a bang.  Oh, God,  I hope she shoots herself.  Did she kill herself?  Then that would be  a terrific bit.  We would have heard  about it in the news.  Yeah,  but it's from Mark Chernoff,  so it's got to be  something a lot less exciting.  Listen to her quit live  on the air unexpectedly  Saturday afternoon.  Here it is.  The big station, 
[03:14:00]  93 BLX,  it is the Gulf Coast  number one  for hip-hop and R&B  and now  with Ray-Ray  and Miranda,  the home team  in the morning.  Do it to it.  What better song  to do it to it  is Inetta,  the mood setter.  And I told you  I had a very  important announcement  and here it is.  I refuse.  I refuse to walk around  and watch people  on my job  looking over my shoulder, 
[03:14:30]  people lying to me,  people talking about me.  It's ridiculous.  It is sad.  I can't take it.  I'm not going to take it.  I don't have to take it.  I'm not a dummy.  I know how to...  Wow,  she's such a rebel.  She's ready to quit,  but she makes sure  she gets the seg,  the mix right.  The segway in.  I ain't a dummy.  I ain't a dummy.  Hey, dummy.  Why are you quitting, dummy?  I can't take it.  I'm not going to take it.  I don't have to take it. 
[03:15:00]  I'm not a...  Does she hit the...  Very good.  I can't use that line.  It stands.  Does she hit the post  right when she says  she's out of there?  I quit.  Very good, Dan.  All right.  I'm going to take it.  I don't have to take it.  I'm not a dummy.  I know how to find  another job.  But I refuse  to walk around people.  You can say  what you want to say  about me.  And if you see me  on the street,  I'll let you know  whatever you want to know.  But I refuse.  For the last six years, 
[03:15:30]  I made $6 an hour.  That ain't nothing.  Wow.  I just got a raise  after six years.  I know...  Maybe if you talk better,  they would give you  a few more bucks.  They didn't know  what you wanted.  They don't know  what you were asking for.  $6?  $6?  $6 an hour  she was doing that for?  Or is she kidding?  No, that's part-time shit.  Oh, wow.  I just got a raise  after six years.  I know I'm qualified.  And after saying this,  I don't care if I ever 
[03:16:00]  get another job  in radio, period.  It does not matter to me.  But Annette will not be  setting the mood  at BLX no more.  I refuse to walk around  with people  that'll speak to you.  Hey, Annette.  How you doing?  But then as soon as  you walk by that bitch,  I will not do it  to myself anymore.  So if you're confused  about what I'm saying,  listen very carefully.  I quit this bitch. 
[03:16:30]  Conor Big Station  93 BLX.  Aw, you stinking,  Netta.  I quit this bitch.  And then hits the commercial?  Yeah, then bam, out.  How about you quit  and then the listeners  hear you just...  Take some calls.  No, just collecting  your stuff in there.  Oh, yeah.  And then there's dead air  until someone can get in there.  Do something.  Wow, that was so dramatic.  I quit.  Ah, another bitch  for this spot.  I ain't fucking...  Ah, who cares?  Mm-hmm.  Goodbye  to Netta,  the mood setter. 
[03:17:00]  What a dope.  I quit.  That's right.  Right for the promo  for the station.  Wow.  Woo.  Hmm.  Really, uh...  Getting edgy with that.  Did she punch out, too?  I punched out.  I punched out.  Mm-hmm.  Netta,  the mood setter.  Yeah.  Setter.  Ugh.  Who cares?  Thank you, Mark.  Really appreciate it, Mark.  Uh, Rich in Chicago,  what's up?  Hey, boys.  I heard about 20 minutes ago 
[03:17:30]  one of the hillbillies  called in  and asked if you guys  were going to play  some Ron and Fez clips.  Then Jimmy said  you guys had a problem  with Ron and Fez.  What's that all about?  Oh, boy.  It was behind-the-scenes stuff.  Yeah, we can't talk about it.  It's, uh...  You might want to ask them.  All right, thanks.  It's really up to them  if they want to...  I want to know why.  If they want to air  that dirty laundry,  but it was, uh,  not good.  Yeah.  So, uh,  that's all we can say  about that.  After being friends  for so long, too.  Yeah, right.  You know.  Unbelievable.  I know.  Let's go to Jess in Jersey.  Break up my party. 
[03:18:00]  Enough on that.  Uh, Jess.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Hey.  I thought you'd really  enjoy this one  on the Jesus station  this morning  because that's what  I wake up to  because it makes you  really want to shut it off.  Their tagline  was riding the comedy  Zamboni  on the ice of life.  Oh, please get audio of that.  It's 99.1 in New York.  99.1 in New York?  Comedy Zamboni?  Yeah, I think it's called  The Star.  On the ice of what?  Wow.  On the ice of life. 
[03:18:30]  Jesus.  We're in New York.  99.1  in New York.  You sure it wasn't  like Jersey or something?  It's one of those  Huh?  It's one of those  Jesus happy-go-lucky stations.  Oh, wow.  All right.  It's W-A-W-Z  99.1 FM.  Christian music.  Christian music.  God, trust me.  When your alarm goes off  to that in the morning,  you'll want to get the hell up.  Oh, wow.  Language.  Oh, baby girl.  Fuck.  Can we listen in  to some Christian music, maybe? 
[03:19:00]  All right.  We'll figure it out.  All right.  Rock on.  Thanks, guys.  I bet it's about God.  Thank you.  Jersey Jesus.  I'll take a break.  Is Rebecca Love here?  And what is she doing  today there, Steve?  Yeah, what is she doing?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  We need to know.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Donna needs to know.  Good, good.  There's my house, Kevin.  She'll, uh...  Turn it on, turn it on.  It is on, sweetie.  I know.  I can't hear anything,  so Jimmy's messing with me.  Uh, she is willing to... 
[03:19:30]  She's very open-minded.  She'll come in.  She'll get naked.  Uh, there is one restriction  that she, uh, made me aware of,  and it's because of an injury  which she is willing to, uh,  discuss graphically.  Okay.  But she's a good egg.  A victim of the modern egg!  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!  She won't do something?  No.  My health doesn't allow this.  Really?  There's some kind of really awful, uh,  internal injury.  Food!  All right!  Oh, my God.  All right, that could be interesting radio. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, yeah.  Hey, uh, the program's scheduled  for this Christian music station.  You start your day off with sharing Jesus.  Sharing Jesus.  Truth for Life is the next program.  These programs are, like, 15 minutes long.  Otto and George MySpace.  Otto and George MySpace.  Otto and George MySpace.  Advertised on the Christian.  Yes.  Adventures in Odyssey.  Family Life Today.  Focus on the family.  In Touch.  Key Life.  Money Matters.  Big Change Moments.  Breakpoint.  Go for it. 
[03:20:30]  Joanie and friends living a legacy.  Ooh.  Listen to the Bible.  Mm-hmm.  Need him.  A word with you.  And it just goes on and on.  Me getting crucified.  Him laughing at me.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Yes, you should be.  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  That's Steve, the guy we just saw.  Oh.  Acting.  That was his acting.  We did a sketch on the show, and that was his acting.  That's him just saying, why not?  And him saying, how'd your parents die?  With the same delivery. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, I know.  You would think that how'd your parents die would have some drama to it, but...  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  It made why not sound like a statement.  Yeah.  Awful.  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  Wow.  Sing a song, sing a song.  That's right.  That was exasperation.  Wow.  Before we take a break, Jimmy in Texas.  Jimmy?  Hi, guys.  I just wanted to know if you were pissed off at Ron and Fez for using the Fire, Fire,  Fire song on the commercial.  Um, it's got...  Whatever, man.  It's tied into a whole bunch of stuff. 
[03:21:30]  That's kind of part of it, but, uh, you know.  Yeah.  I specifically talked to Fez.  It's just been shit over time.  I knew what it was.  Tell you the truth.  It's really up to them.  I'll let it out.  It's, uh, really up to them if they want to air this, uh, dirty laundry on their show  today.  Nah.  Uh, Whitetail, what's up?  Hey, hi, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  You know, Ronnie made one reference the other day on the radio about them signing Twitchels  as being, uh, like the hole on the show.  And Opie was pretty clear about wanting Twitchels to just pretty much fucking curl up and die. 
[03:22:00]  So, is that what's going on?  Dude, like I said, it's a bunch of things.  Um, whatever, dude.  You could tie in a couple of things like that, maybe, um, let's, again, it's up to them.  Like Opie said.  They want to talk about the company.  It's just something that happened, yeah, over time.  What do they do?  Just wake up every morning and just listen to our show for their show prep?  Oh, please.  Say no more, say no more.  But, you know, I think you understand what's going on here.  Hey, Jimmy, you rule, man.  Thanks, fella.  Thanks for signing my stuff at DCU and Worcester.  You're the ball.  You, I was waiting for you to call in.  You had no problem. 
[03:22:30]  And, dude, this is the sound almonds make.  Oh, my God.  Stacy fucking Stone from the Christian Station looks just like me.  Oh, come on.  Let me look.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  I'm growing a beard.  Wow.  Wow.  What the fuck?  You might want to do a little upper half.  Look at Fat Mark Maron, David Dean.  Yeah.  You might want to do a separate at birth section on Wackbag because there's a lot of those happening lately.  Ima says that Anthony looks like the shoe bomber. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah.  I look like Stacy Stone, it looks like, from the Star 989.1.  And someone said Jimmy looks like Boy George cleaning up the garbage yesterday.  No, Michael J. Fox, I got my whole life.  Yeah?  I really did.  Really?  Yes.  So maybe you could do a little separate at birth.  Really?  When you were a kid?  Maybe 50 times I've gotten that since I was an adult.  Michael J. Fox?  Yeah.  Don't sound so, like, it couldn't be possible.  I'm looking at your kid picture trying to see it.  No, no, no.  Not that young.  When I was, like, 1920.  Oh, Michael J. Fox.  Where's the kid picture?  That's me when I was a boy. 
[03:23:30]  On the left?  Looks like a young lesbian.  With the glasses.  Yeah.  Yes.  I should be walking through a Peanuts cartoon.  Wow.  Johnny Stone in the morning, he does a bit called Submit Prayer Requests.  Ah, good.  Good.  And then we can view prayer requests.  Oh, God.  Jesus, stick your finger in my eye.  All right.  Well, we'll take a break and we'll try to get more info on this radio station.  What? 
[03:24:00]  Selfish.  Oh, God.  Selfish prayers.  There's World War III happening, but someone wants, uh, please pray that my house will be  sold soon.  I bought another house and I'm paying for both of them right now.  Okay.  Oh, holy crap.  I don't think God's going to hear your prayer.  Yeah.  Ah, please pray for my boyfriend and I to stop fighting about misunderstanding and to bring  back the love that it was there before.  Amen.  What about love?  Just start blowing them again and everything will be all right. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah.  Uh, I need all the prayer I can get.  I have three blood tests to confirm.  All right.  Fuck.  What diseases I can't even pronounce.  Good luck, bro.  I just found out that my bro, 47, was hit on his motorcycle while we're- God, this is  depressing shit.  Yeah, people, you know.  Please pray I find someone to love me and I them.  Here's one.  Please pray that my husband finds his way home. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah, I wonder where he's going.  I can't think of a minute.  You found your luck, right?  Yeah.  Please pray that I get to go to a special event in my children's lives that my husband  does not want me to attend.  These prayers stink.  All right.  We'll take a break.  We'll continue with Otto and George.  And I don't know.  What?  Uh, Ruben in Laredo.  What's up?  Yeah, man. 
[03:25:30]  I just want to tell you guys, why don't you just end the show now and put on Ron and  Fez, man?  This shit's getting boring already.  Then change the channel.  Oh, boy.  Yes, or at least speak without that silly accent, Ruben.  You sissified motherfuckers.  And that potty mouth on you.  They're stealing our stuff.  And he's drunk.  They're stealing our stuff.  Ruben, why do you talk with a dumb accent?  Fuck.  Nobody's stealing your shit, man.  Ron and Fez is better than your stupid.  No, Ruben, what third world dump did your mother crawl out of?  No disrespect, but why are you talking with that silly accent? 
[03:26:00]  You dumb fucks.  Language.  They're stealing our show.  Why do you have a potty mouth?  Look, you can't face the fact that Ronnie and Fezzy there are rip-off artists.  They're ripping us off.  But it's better than hearing...  It's down the open now.  It's down the open now.  Yeah, it's up to them if they want to admit some things.  Yeah.  I mean, if they have an audience full of dirty, filthy people who don't speak with a proper  accent, that's fine.  There you go.  It'll be up to them.  Can I go home now?  Just speak English properly. 
[03:26:30]  I don't hear you, though.  Stop with the accent, you unclipped savage.  Let's go to Brad in Virginia.  Brad?  Hey.  Hey.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  I think you guys are lucky that you have Ronnie and Fez on your channel.  Do you?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think they're a lot funnier than you are.  Are they?  Then why are you listening to us?  I think that I'm waiting for the Ronnie and Fez.  That's not a good answer.  You know what time it comes on.  You don't tune in at 10.30 and wait for an hour and a half. 
[03:27:00]  So you're lying.  Why are you listening?  Just tell the truth.  It's not hard to be funnier than us when you have the whole morning to listen to our show  and then do it again and make it a little better.  Yeah.  I mean, let's be honest here.  Well, I mean, I like you guys.  I think you're funny at times, but for the most part, you just...  There you go.  Beat it.  So you're like, we caught him lying.  Why are you listening?  Waiting for the Ronnie and Fez show 90 minutes before it starts, then a minute later.  Well, I think you guys are funny.  Well, then just tell the truth the first time I asked, boy.  Eric in Utah. 
[03:27:30]  Hello.  Yeah.  I pray that my wife's black eyes will go away before she goes out in public.  You what?  That's pretty funny.  I pray my wife's black eyes will go away before she goes out in public.  Clumsy girl on those steps again.  Let's go to Rob on Long Island.  Rob.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I don't want to start any rumors here, but I think I heard Ronnie say that Jimmy Norton  sucks big, fat tranny, Dick.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, it's okay when we say, because we're all friends here, but when they say, you know, 
[03:28:00]  it hurts a little.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, exactly.  It hurts Jimmy a little.  All right.  Let's go to a gym in South Dakota.  Yeah.  Another Ronnie and Fez fan who crapped out.  Greg in D.C., what's up?  Hey, guys.  Just wanted to let you know we're actually coming up to do your walkover tomorrow, but Pittsburgh,  we were up there over the weekend, and they love you.  We got our first free Opie and Anthony shirts in Pittsburgh.  Not in D.C. where you got XM.  Oh, no, no.  We had to drive to Pittsburgh to get Opie. 
[03:28:30]  I'm glad you enjoy it, man.  You think about that when they're yanking us off Pittsburgh next week.  Why?  We don't know.  Why?  I have no idea, dude.  You talk to them.  I'm not kidding.  They're standing outside the stadium, outside the Pirate Stadium, and the station up there  is giving away your T-shirts.  Excellent.  Well, that will end, what is today?  Today is Wednesday.  Try getting them next Monday.  Jesus Christ.  Well, fuck Ron and Fez.  You guys are funny.  Language.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  We'll break.  It's getting a little uncomfortable in here. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Across America.  True tales from the road.  Real evil.  Real stories.  Real rules.  Opie and Anthony, I'm headed out of Houston, Texas, over to Lake Charles, Louisiana on Interstate  10, and just got wowed by a good-looking blonde cougar, driving one of them little Suzuki  deep, and she just popped out one little titty.  Looked like a nice little B-size.  Looked great.  Wow sticker worked just as advertised, man. 
[03:29:30]  Got wowed on a Tuesday by some 50-year-old chick hanging down, slapjacks.  It was pretty gross.  That's Jeff the Trucker from Eureka, California.  I got wowed yesterday by the university.  Then a little girl showed me a little cupcake with her little Hershey's Kisses on them.  Nice little mouthful.  We had a good time.  Just put the sticker on my truck, guys.  If you get wowed, call the Opie and Anthony wow line, 866-WOW-ME-05.  And if you need a wow sticker, go to opieandanthony.com. 
[03:30:00]  Very proud of my big tip.  Oh, God, be my night.  On your way out of line.  Hey, let's say hi to Eddie in Ohio. 
[03:30:30]  Eddie, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  You're killing me.  You're bitching about Ronnie Fez killing your shit.  Y'all always killing Howard shit, you fucking Howard hack.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  Yeah.  Always stealing Howard stuff.  Every time I turn around, you're always stealing her shit.  Give us a, maybe, give me an example of the Howard shit we steal.  Guys, I'm fucking with you.  I love you both.  I love all of you guys.  I knew it.  Thank you, man.  I hate the people that love us.  And you kill me. 
[03:31:00]  You're always joking around, and all of a sudden, boom, you just turn serious.  And some intelligent shit comes out of your mouth.  Thanks, man.  Love you guys.  All right, thank you.  You're a good boy.  Y'all have a good one.  Boom, and then some shit comes out of your ass.  All right.  Right.  Where's Rebecca Love?  She has an injury or something.  Rebecca.  Do you expect me to believe you don't know your rat from your right?  Hi, Rebecca.  Hi, Rebecca.  Rebecca Love, everyone. 
[03:31:30]  Hi, Rebecca.  She's a busty gal.  Hi.  Hello.  You were here for the ostrich story, I think?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  One of the best stories ever.  Oh, is it?  You look different.  Your hair was down or something?  Different color?  Um, same color.  Just put the extensions in.  Yeah.  I thought I asked you not to bust in here like that.  Hey, who ordered the throw pillows?  That's Otto and George.  This girl could do the pencil test with a typewriter.  Well, yeah, you certainly do have, um, yeah, it's very nice. 
[03:32:00]  You've got some apples.  You're very chesty.  And you're wearing a little vest, which is good.  Well, I wear the vest because, you know, you're walking in New York City and all, you  don't want everybody staring.  But I can take it off.  Do they, uh, why not?  Wow.  Wow.  It's Barbara Hershey with John Goodman's tits.  A little perkier, though.  Oh, man. 
[03:32:30]  Wow.  And, um...  You woke up George there, Rebecca.  Yeah, what exactly...  Tell our listeners what exactly you do.  Well, I, um, I have sex for a living.  Oh.  I'm a legal prostitute, if you think about it.  Nice.  If you think about it, let me for a second.  Okay.  Are you going to do an Arthur impression or are you leaving it up to me?  You've got to do an...  Are you a hooker?  I thought you were going to do Arthur.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I thought I was just doing very well with you. 
[03:33:00]  So, yeah, I get paid to have sex.  I'm a porn star.  Porn star.  Porn star.  Of course.  And, uh, how many guys?  How many guys would you say you've co-starred with?  Would that be in public or private?  Uh, oh, hell, you know that...  But, uh...  How many movies?  Uh, over a hundred.  Over a hundred movies?  Yeah.  Wow.  Multiple guys per movie?  No.  I've never done two guys at once.  No?  No.  No DP?  No DP.  Saving that for marriage or, uh... 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  Any ass?  You do the ass?  Nope.  No anal.  No anal either?  No.  So you're straight blowjobs and pussy?  I only do blowjobs if it's part of the sex scene.  Wow.  So all...  If you don't do pussy, then you're a lousy person.  I do pussy.  Oh, okay.  I was gonna say...  No.  You just plugged all our holes up and...  You won't just do a blowjob scene, though.  No.  What's the point?  You're gonna...  You might as well just shoot a full scene and chop it up into a blowjob scene, you know?  I like a good blowjob scene.  I like to kill two birds with one stone.  I like a good blowjob scene.  I love cold corn.  You can have a great blowjob, you know, scene. 
[03:34:00]  I just don't want to show up just for that.  No.  Eh.  Is it a money issue?  No.  No, no.  I only shoot to dance.  I mean, I shoot for Wicked, VCA, well, used to be VCA, Hustler, you know, all the top  name companies, which are feature films usually, and they chop those up into gonzo, so less  movies I have to do.  Okay.  Yeah.  Whatever works for you.  We hear you have an injury.  I'm gonna ask.  Yeah, what happened?  Okay, this is what happened.  I was on set, and we were doing a photo shoot, and the last photo shoot, I thought, oh, I'm 
[03:34:30]  gonna get a little creative.  Done it before.  Took my shoe off.  It's a five-inch heel.  Mm-hmm.  I'm thinking, insertion.  Yeah, that would be a great idea.  That would make a great photo.  Well, anyway, I guess my shoe was a little too sharp, too spikish.  Oh, wow.  Uh-oh.  I inserted, but you really can't feel, what, past four inches in there?  You know, on the last inch, it kinda broke through some skin. 
[03:35:00]  Oh, I'm getting that weird, tingly feeling in my nutsack when they're talking about this.  Aren't you getting like that?  I get that.  That weird tingle?  I got a few problems with this.  Go ahead.  What happened?  No, go ahead.  Go ahead.  I didn't feel it at first.  And what happened was, I thought I started my period, cause, you know.  It started bleeding.  Yeah.  Wow.  And the photographer stopped.  He's like, oh my God.  And I'm thinking, no, it's that time of month.  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah.  So we eventually stopped.  And I...  Here's the question I got.  Did you seek medical attention?  Yes, I did. 
[03:35:30]  Here's the question I got.  Couldn't you have like faked that photo?  And just like saw it off the heel and then have it, you know.  And then it's like, wow.  These are good shoes for her.  And half a shoe.  You know what?  Great idea.  You bring in a stunt shoe.  Yeah.  A stunt shoe.  I know.  Right.  Seriously.  Why take the chance?  No one would have known.  One or the other.  Nothing.  I hear you now, right?  Good.  It was good.  I liked it.  Or at least take a leave before you do that.  Well, I've done it before.  I've done it before.  I guess I just didn't lube it up very well.  And it was my shoes, you know.  I don't want to cut a $100 pair of shoes. 
[03:36:00]  I was like...  I want to be in show business, but I don't want like an ice skate shoved up my ass.  How far up was it?  Your cervix?  Actually, where it cut, it actually was a lot lower.  It was the sharp end that just, you know, cut the beginning part.  So how long does that put you out of work?  Do you get work from its comp?  Well, no, I work.  I work.  Oh, you do?  I just do B-rated movies right now and Cinemax and stuff.  I do those.  The doctor said it was high heels, but I knew what it was. 
[03:36:30]  Well, thank God it was the doctor that knew what I did for a living.  Because you imagine walking in there going, by the way, I shoved a five-inch heel up my cookie.  My shoe.  It hurt my pussy.  I fell off a ladder.  And my head was bashed apart.  So I hurt myself.  Yeah.  And how long does that take to heal, that kind of injury?  It's like a rotator cuff.  It takes about four weeks, four to six.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's all nice.  You've got a gash in your gash.  It's not too bad, but it's the, you know, the bacteria that can get up in there that I... 
[03:37:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, you don't want that.  Don't want that.  Do you shave your private area?  Of course.  Uh-oh, men.  I hope men do, too.  If I'm shaving, you better be shaving.  Jimmy Norton likes it.  Nothing.  You shave your cock everything.  Jimmy and George right now.  I find that very disturbing.  Why?  Why?  Why do you need to shave it for?  Women like it better.  They like it better.  They do.  I don't want to be flossing.  Isn't that ridiculous?  Shave all this.  I knew you'd become a weirdo.  No. 
[03:37:30]  I'm not that hairy to begin with.  I don't have much hair to begin with.  There's nothing wrong with keeping it clipped.  Like, you don't want your bushes in front of your house growing over the windows.  But you don't want to just rip them out by the roots, either.  When did you get it in your mind that you have to look aesthetically good  for the other sex?  It's a woman's job to get dolled up for us.  How do you know it's for the other sex?  Dolled up.  Oh.  He's not a homosexual.  Well, I'm just saying.  You never assume.  No, it's true.  But, no, it's for girls.  But girls like it.  I had a girl one time tell me,  you should shave that.  It's a dame's job to get dolled up, not yours. 
[03:38:00]  The girl will be more inclined to suck your balls if they're shaved.  I've never had a woman not like it.  They've always went, like, any reaction I've ever gotten has been,  ooh, I like that.  It's never been bad.  Yeah.  I got to see it, Otto, when we filmed a little video.  Yeah?  Did you now?  We had to do a second take because I laughed really hard.  Completely smooth and shaved.  He looked like a little boy with a loose cock.  But then you have to do it every day.  No, my cock was miserable that day.  I was packing maybe a half.  It was so soft it wouldn't bend.  It was like a fucking, like a little midget thumb. 
[03:38:30]  That's what I had sticking out of my torso.  Oh, God.  The video, well, you don't get to see that.  You get to see Jimmy's ass, though, because he's completely naked.  Yeah, Jimmy did a little porno.  In the shower rape video that's on opiananthony.com.  Why do I use Google a lot?  Shower rape scene.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was for our comedy show.  He had a high heel up his ass.  Ouch.  Yeah.  I know.  Well, I don't know how that feels.  So you couldn't do any fuck scenes.  But you could do like those movies they show in hotels or something where you just make 
[03:39:00]  believe that you haven't sex.  I call it Skinamax.  Where the guy is so far out of position you couldn't possibly be fucking.  Absolutely.  Can't the guys get closer?  It's like, what's he fucking with his belly button?  To me, they look harder to do.  I watched them shoot one time.  I watched them do a double penetration, and then I watched them shoot the soft core.  And the soft core looked harder because you can't stick it in.  And these guys were banging on her ass.  It was like he was holding on and fucking, but his dick was just hanging out.  And it looked...  That could hurt, yeah.  Oh, my God.  It was the most brutal thing I've ever seen.  Like, regular sex looking. 
[03:39:30]  Wow.  And then you've got to make sure it's hidden so you can't see the cock just...  But then they're both touching penises, aren't they?  Because you're not putting it in.  You're hiding it.  So they've got to be sliding.  I don't think they care.  Yeah, that's not homophobic.  You can get a rod in front of all those people and you're fucking a chick in the ass.  You're homophobic.  It goes out the window.  Guys like fucking the chick in the same vag hole.  Or in a mouth.  Yeah, in a mouth.  Two cocks.  And you know, it's just two dicks rubbing up against each other.  I don't care what the surroundings are.  Still two dicks rubbing.  But you're still hard rubbing against another dick. 
[03:40:00]  It's all a day's work for these guys.  So tell me.  You are not...  Yeah.  It's a little gay if you ask me.  That's all I'm saying.  It's a lot of gay, actually.  They're very happy.  I disagree.  If you can...  I couldn't do it.  But if you're able to do that, like, to fuck in front of a crew and nothing bothers you...  Well, that's cool.  You got a cock in there?  Yeah, me too.  All right, hello.  We're talking about double penetration.  The second your dicks touch...  The second dick touches dick, you're in a whole other territory, Jimmy.  I agree.  Doesn't matter.  I would...  For me, it would be the same thing would happen.  I can't...  I've tried threesomes, and I've had a few, but my dick always wilts. 
[03:40:30]  I just...  I don't like another dude in the room.  It just kind of creeps me out.  I don't like, you know, a guy's wife when he was there.  It was just like, ugh, it was too much.  Oof.  Yeah.  Who are your friends?  I meet lovely people.  She's all over the internet.  But, you know, two in the mouth I could never do.  Two in the mouth?  Two in the mouth?  Wait a minute.  The husband sits in a folding chair while you...  One time...  This is when I was, like, 18.  I mean, I answered a lady's ad in the newspaper, I'll show you how long ago it was, and she  called me back, like a month later, and she said, well, I was looking for straight guys, 
[03:41:00]  so I kind of put my ad as a single, but I have a husband.  Now, he does not want to do anything with you.  All he wants to do is watch, and I'm like, okay.  So I fool around with him.  She's, like, 35 at the time.  I'm, like, 19.  And he looked like a pizza maker.  He looked like Robert Duvall, who was balding.  And he just kind of fucking...  He just watched the whole thing.  He didn't get involved at all.  He didn't jerk off?  He didn't jerk off at all.  Then we went into the bedroom.  I think this was like...  The fuck is that about?  Well, maybe he couldn't get it up.  That's the only way to prove he wanted him.  No, no, he could.  We went in there again.  He wanted to de-peer. 
[03:41:30]  Right, what's that?  Double penetration, but I lost my rod.  Like, when she was blowing me, and he was banging her, it was okay.  But when he wanted me to put it in a pussy while he was in her ass, I just...  I lost my rod.  It was just too creepy.  I couldn't do it.  And that was too creepy.  Him sitting in a chair watching you fuck his wife wasn't creepy.  The Paco watches me, fuck her.  Wow.  And then we 69, and she blew me.  And this is the last time I saw them.  I think I saw them twice, because this second time is when, like, the actual sex happened. 
[03:42:00]  The first time, she just blew me on the sofa.  Great sermon, Father.  See you next Sunday.  I'm fucking laying back, and she's on my face, and she's blowing me.  And he was, like, down there watching, and I couldn't see what was going on.  I don't think he took a swipe, but I couldn't be sure.  I was like, I got to get out of here.  Took a swipe?  I don't think he did, but I had to listen.  He might have.  I don't think so.  I was just too creeped out.  You might have gotten up and...  Fuck that.  Yeah.  Wow.  I didn't dump or anything.  What did he...  Oh, you didn't dump?  You didn't?  No.  Because I was going to say, what was his reaction when you dumped?  No, I didn't dump at all. 
[03:42:30]  I think the first time I did was she blew me on the sofa.  Oh, and then what was his reaction?  I don't remember.  It was like, ooh.  No, no, no, no.  It was never anything like that.  He's just watching his wife blow me, and I was like, too much.  Too personal.  Too creepy.  Wow.  This was before you were in show business at all?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was still a pop.  Yeah.  Get in there, Lance.  Yeah.  I don't serve with a boy like you.  Do you get a lot of those offers now that you're like a celebrity?  Not a celebrity.  It was just a couple...  But yeah, I get them...  No, you're a celebrity now.  The girl who told me to shave, it happened on a threesome. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was completely...  That was in Jersey.  Another guy or two girls?  Yeah, but he was banging her while she blew me.  That's the way it should be.  No double penetration.  Yeah, she blew me and she...  There's an etiquette.  Yeah, to me, I just...  That's acceptable.  If you're over there and I'm here, that's fine.  All right, let's say hi to Jason in Florida.  Jason.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey, Jason.  You know, you guys missed something.  Rebecca, you said that after four inches, you don't feel anything. 
[03:43:30]  That's why you had a five-inch cut down there?  No.  I didn't say I had a five-inch cut.  I said by the last inch, you know, that's when I started bleeding or the injury happened.  So you don't feel that last inch is what you're saying.  You know what?  I just didn't feel it scrape.  Oh, my God.  Oh, see, I was thinking someone with guys that hope there.  Well, there is hope because I think in the porn industry, guys are too big.  I prefer an average, you know, six to seven inches. 
[03:44:00]  Nice.  You don't want Lexington's heel?  I prefer my heel.  How about Lexington?  Oh, my God.  Where am I going to put all that?  I can't park a limo in my shed.  Oh.  Where would I put that?  That guy's packing.  I'm not saying I'm small, but, you know, there's only so much depth.  I'd be giving head at the same time.  Yeah, he's a fucking animal.  Limo in the shed.  Do you have a large...  That's terrific.  That's a vaginal.  I don't have, like, length-wise, you'll bottom out. 
[03:44:30]  It's like getting kicked in the nuts.  You'll bottom out with me.  I actually have a code when I'm doing somebody on film.  I pinch their inner thighs so they know they're bottoming out.  What does that mean, bottoming out?  It means you're...  You're hitting the back wall.  Yeah, it's like getting kicked in the nuts.  Oh, really?  In the womb.  Yeah.  It hurts.  It hurts.  I'd love to get my leg pinched just once in my life.  Just one leg pinch is all I asked for.  Just pounding away, no pinching happening whatsoever.  All I never felt is two hands on my ass cheeks pulling me in harder, just begging for more  cock than I can provide during Is That It? 
[03:45:00]  Please!  God, the devil, hell, heaven!  Just hoping for one lousy pinch.  Nothing.  Oh, my God.  Well, we're running out of show because we've got to get out of here right at 11 today because  we've got a conference call.  More shit.  So, what are we promoting?  What are we doing?  What do we got, Rebecca?  Help us out.  Why don't we do something fun to end the show?  We got the Pal Talk cameras in front of you.  People are checking you out on Pal Talk.  Can we see you naked?  Well, absolutely.  I was waiting.  Oh!  Wow, what a lovely answer.  Hold on.  I've never actually heard that in studio before. 
[03:45:30]  I know.  I've conducted the entire interview, nude.  I wish I could just walk out like you, Hefner, you know?  Oh, my God.  Just...  Why get dressed?  What, with a stroke?  Well, it depends.  How is that stroke?  Oh, hey.  Bye-bye.  Wow.  Oh, wowie.  There they are.  I am dancing at Club Risque.  Okay.  I've been in Philly, right?  In Burlington, New Jersey, Delaware, in Philadelphia, and...  Where's the other one?  It's in Bristol, Burlington.  There you go.  Philly.  Bristol and Philly.  Wow. 
[03:46:00]  At RebeccaLove.com and dancing at the Club Risque, which...  Yeah, Philly Club.  They're good friends of the show.  Just go to ClubRisque.net and you'll get my schedule.  Those are real breasts?  Well, I paid for them.  Okay.  They look like...  No, go ahead.  Squeeze them.  All right.  Oh, Jimmy will...  There you go.  They're hard.  Wow.  Well, don't pay me.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You said squeeze them hard.  Jimmy.  What do I do?  I don't know.  Jimmy, punch them.  Punch them like fucking speed bags.  I'm very nice with buzzers.  The larger ones usually like them touched stuff. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah, I can tell.  No, I am.  I started with a D, so I just fixed a flat.  Nice.  Oh, you fixed a flat?  I fixed a flat because they went D long.  Yeah.  So, I was like, Doc, what can you do?  Yeah.  I'll put some bags in there.  That's terrific.  What about titty fucking in the movies?  Oh, my God.  That's my specialty.  Oh, is it?  I thought so.  Holy moly.  There is, I told you about that one routine I did, right, where I flip them around.  I let the guy lay over on top of me.  Uh-huh.  I prop my head back with a pillow so I can lick their ass, their in-between part, suck 
[03:47:00]  on their balls.  At the same time, titty fuck, because I have a move in between.  Right.  Hold my hand there, so it's a hand-job, titty fuck.  Oh, my God.  Lick the ass.  That's going to be proud of that one.  Suck on the balls.  Wow.  That recipe is not in my cookbook.  That's a good one.  All girls should be able to do that.  That's a good one.  You multitask.  And you know what?  They lose it in, like, two seconds.  Yeah.  That's very special.  And they have, you know, they can eat me out at the same time if they want the extra  or nerve.  Why not?  You're down there.  Why not?  Yeah. 
[03:47:30]  I might as well.  You're face-to-face with it.  What are you going to do?  Talk?  You might as well.  So, anyway, that's, a titty fuck is what I love to do.  Yeah.  And I like it when the guy actually lays on his back, so I can hold it here, and he holds  my breasts, so he gets that stimulation.  Wait, can we get a prop or something?  I'm trying to think.  Wait a minute.  Maybe a water bottle or something.  Here, give her the water bottle.  Okay.  What if a bat will do?  Yeah.  All right.  So, yeah, let's see some of these moves here.  So, say the guy's laying down.  Of course, it's a lot smaller than this.  And he'll hold from the other side, like, here. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah.  Someone give a mic her.  Yeah, we got a mic her.  All right.  So, he'll hold.  I'm a helper.  Where's that pal talk around?  Jimmy's helping.  Thanks, Christ.  We're going to turn the pal talk around.  Sorry.  All right.  He'll be holding my boot.  Lay back.  Okay.  All right.  Wait, maybe that's Jimmy's, yeah.  Okay.  Strong.  I'm holding their breasts.  And so, I'll just go like this, and I'll put lube there so it'll move nice, and then  I can grab the balls.  Hotter.  Grab the balls, have the fingernails going, and then sometimes I slide my finger to their  ass.  Oh.  She's the greatest. 
[03:48:30]  I like that.  Is that an original move?  Like, did you patent that one?  Probably the other one.  I was hoping for a chick tooth, at least.  A finger to the ass is, uh, important.  Do I feel it?  Yeah, you like that?  No.  Do I smell an analogy coming?  No.  Oh.  Just a big thank you if it happens.  And also, I wear, like, teeth guards, and that's even better.  What?  Well, because they have Invisalines.  See?  What are those?  We can't see, because they're invisible. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah.  Well, okay.  Hello.  You know our cameraman from the movie Omega Man with Charlton Heston?  One of the bloodless vampires.  Oh, wow.  We never thought of that one for Sam.  So, anyway, a guard.  Sammy.  Black or white?  Ah, Sammy.  We're trying to figure out what color he is.  My dear old Sammy.  Yeah.  All right, so what's the move?  Because you got the guards, the teeth guards, right?  The guards actually help, because then you can use a little pressure with your teeth without  actually...  Oh, without giving the teeth.  It's nice and smooth. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah, it's nice and smooth.  Why do you have them?  What do they do?  Uh, straighten my teeth.  They're like braces.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, they're like braces.  But they're plastic, and then each one's a little different, and you shove it in.  I did notice.  She's got nice teeth when she walks in.  Wow.  Right.  Like to push you in a rock quarry.  It's my job.  It's my job.  That's how it works.  Yeah.  Very nice.  And she could use that.  It's almost like getting a gum job.  Pretty much.  A little bit.  It's exactly what it's like.  How about that?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, hunt.  Let's go to Dave in Seattle.  David.  Good morning, everybody. 
[03:50:00]  Hey, David.  Rebecca, I just want you to know that you completely made our day.  There's four of us here who, we're just glad you're not a size queen, because when you  said you just like your average six or seven inches, it just, we all got chubbed up.  Well, yay.  So what's that total?  Seven times four?  Yeah.  Well, I have to handle all four.  I guess guys like hearing, you know, their average size, they like hearing that a girl  likes average size.  I want to feel it all the way inside me and those balls hitting the outside, you know? 
[03:50:30]  And it's not going to happen with something that's too long.  With monster cock.  Exactly.  There is too much.  Well, thank you for explaining it, Rebecca, because now I'm even happier.  Well, yay.  All right.  Yay.  Listen, guys, if there's a chance, Opie, I'm reminding you, the last segment from  N.E.W.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe tomorrow.  Oh, yeah.  We forgot.  We got distracted today.  All right, David, thank you.  Take the gas pipe.  All right.  Let's say hi to Tommy in Brooklyn. 
[03:51:00]  Tommy.  Hey, how are you guys?  Rebecca, I want to ask you something that I know Jimmy would want to ask.  And that's, could you demonstrate this with Jimmy?  And Jimmy could report back to us so we know exactly how good it is.  I'd be too nervous, sir.  No.  I just did.  I'd be too nervous.  I meant the real thing.  All right, James, I tried.  He's like Brooklyn.  I can't with all these guys in the room.  My penis would wilt like radiation was dumped onto me.  No, he's saying after the show, you two go off, you two lovebirds go off. 
[03:51:30]  Oh, like a private moment?  Yeah.  I understand where you're coming from.  Hold hands, lovebirds.  Emil Sitka.  Is that his name?  Yep.  All right.  That guy's from Brooklyn.  Who's he with?  So, that's it.  Rebecca Love, clubrisque.com.  Yes.  Dot net.  Dot net.  I think it's dot net.  But just go to RebeccaLove.com.  RebeccaLove.com should have your schedule.  Yeah, absolutely.  All right.  Very nice.  Anything else there, Rebecca?  Any other moves? 
[03:52:00]  No.  There's really not much for me to talk about.  Nothing's exciting.  Just sticking a heel and cutting yourself up.  Well, you know, that's every day.  A little tip fucking.  That was pretty good.  Yeah.  I think all in all, it went well.  Yeah.  I mean, I have stories.  You want to show Jimmy your ass?  Oh, show my ass?  Yeah, show Jimmy your ass.  Jimmy's an ass.  I'm an ass.  Wow.  Oh, there you go.  It's very nice.  Zach?  That's a nice tush.  Really?  Oh, it certainly is.  I don't like it.  Why? 
[03:52:30]  Problem?  No, no.  No, I just, eh.  It's not my thing.  No?  No.  What's that?  Oh, the camera.  They shut the camera off.  You ever do the ass crack fucking?  Can I cum on your back?  Yeah, I've had the cum on the back.  And then the tip fuck?  I've done anal.  Come on the stump.  Oh, hey.  I didn't know that.  I just didn't do it in the movies.  Oh.  That's monster cock going in there.  I don't want to wear diapers later on.  Personal life. 
[03:53:00]  Personal life, honey.  Why do you think I like five to six inches?  Ah.  It's a beautiful thing.  For the ass.  I love it.  Of course.  All right.  Love it.  Of course.  It's good.  Nothing wrong with that?  No.  And what's the site?  There's a...  Nice segue.  RebeccaLove.com.  Oh, yeah.  RebeccaLove.com. 
[03:53:30]  All right.  Otto, you got anything?  Fantabulous.  We're ending the show.  What?  For her?  Or her.  You.  Oh, us.  What do you got?  It was a fun day.  It was a fun day.  Yeah.  I had a good time.  Go home and barbecue now.  Otto had a...  You had a great appearance today, Otto.  And we'll see you at the PNC Arts Center.  Can't wait.  Thank you.  August 26th for the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus.  Tickets still on sale through Ticketmaster.com.  All right?  Yep.  And Rebecca, I'm sure a lot of people will check you out at Club Risque.  I hope so.  I give one hell of a lap dance.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, because I don't dance. 
[03:54:00]  Ooh.  Do you just grind on it?  Oh, there's so much more than to just dance.  Would you like to give Jimmy one?  Come on, Castelli.  Give Jimmy a lap dance.  I can't.  I can't give him a lap dance.  I mean, I don't dance.  Yeah, that's exactly.  Oh.  No, I'm sorry.  Did I...  Did you do that?  No, I have no idea.  I do nothing.  Hey, whatever.  I like that better than a dance, right?  Mm-hmm.  The doll, you know, chick just laying her hair in your lap and then slapping her ass. 
[03:54:30]  Stop it.  There's tricks to, like, you know, blowing hot air down there.  They wear the shorts, the hand, you know.  The hand might slip.  So is that a...  That's kind of a tip for the guys if they're out there.  Wear some shorts to the strip clubs.  This is great.  Without underwear.  That's a good tip.  Bruno Curdy's dead, and this one's skanking it up in Philadelphia on the weekend.  That is a...  I have no kids when it comes to a hula.  I would like to get...  That's very nice. 
[03:55:00]  So let's say a guy has his shorts on.  Now, this is a hypothetical situation.  I'm just saying, on some planet where this is completely allowed, and he's got a hard-on,  and your hand slips up, and you feel that.  Would you leave it at that, or would you maybe take care of business?  Well, here's the thing.  My lap dances...  I've never jerked anyone off.  No.  No.  But there's tricks I do where they won't even last two songs. 
[03:55:30]  You're like Uri Geller?  I'm...  I'm like...  You don't even have to jerk them off.  You just kind of look at it, rub the side a little, and...  I mean, you can rub and all.  Stick bends.  But there's no...  I mean, you don't have to have their hand around it.  Just talk really dirty.  My boobs are down there, and they, like, stroke up and down the...  The shorts are great, because it can actually rub, and it's like wearing a condom, you know?  I don't know.  That's the last time I come to this, Friendly.  I'm just...  Most guys like it, and they enjoy it. 
[03:56:00]  Every guy jacking off has tried experimentation with certain things, and one of which was to see how little you actually have to touch yourself to make yourself cum.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  You give that a whirl.  Yeah.  Does it work?  Growing up, you get bored with the same old just jacking, so you're like, let me see the minimal amount of stimulation, just mental.  Yeah.  I'll just use complete mental.  Grandma.  And believe me, by the end...  What?  Ew.  What?  I'm not saying hold out.  Oh, I'm the only one?  I'm saying just using your... 
[03:56:30]  Oh, I'm the only one.  You're the only one.  Grandma.  Right.  Grandma.  And no matter what, at the end, I mean, I'm cranking it like fucking Helen Keller at the water pump.  Yeah.  I have...  Whoa!  Whoa!  It never works.  I need more stimulation than just talking or hot air.  Well, there's a lot of things going on.  There's a hair blower and a fucking tape recorder, if that works.  A hair blower?  Yeah, you know.  That's a new meaning to blowjob.  Boo!  I mean, if hot air and dirty talk worked, but, you know, you kind of need, like... 
[03:57:00]  Touch.  You need some cranking.  God, your poor thing.  It's going to fall off.  No, I'm not talking like that.  It's got a big hog.  It can handle it.  It's not like a taffy puller or something.  Just kind of, you know...  Needs a little more stimulation than just a little yapping and maybe a brush on the side.  No, it needs more than a brush.  My hair won't allow it.  That's why they're called friction dances.  Good evening. 
[03:57:30]  Lady Trucker, what's up?  Hey, George has a prominent woody.  Would Rebecca be willing to do it with a dummy?  George has a wooden cock.  How big is a wooden...  Is he like Pinocchio?  I'm hung like a kayak paddle.  That's from my album.  I'll laugh.com.  George fucked in a movie.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:58:00]  Yeah, Nina Hartley.  God damn, I forgot about that.  Yeah, George fucked...  She's a legend.  Yeah.  She is.  Legendary cum catcher.  I made out with her in the same film.  Yeah.  After the blowjob?  After.  After he fucked.  After George fucked her, I kissed her.  We all laugh.  Yeah.  You sucked his cock?  Fucking cock's bigger than yours.  It's that fat pig wooden puppet.  All right, well.  Hope you enjoyed it.  I'm sorry about the high heel injury. 
[03:58:30]  You're sweet, girl.  Honey, I don't even care.  You could have made fun of me this whole show.  It's not going to hurt me.  I do porn for a living.  You think I care what people think?  It's true.  Yeah.  How did a guy get on a plane with a screwdriver, Vaseline, and matches?  Yeah.  A note referencing Al-Qaeda.  And a note referencing Al-Qaeda.  This guy wanted to arrest me.  During the heaviest security.  You did?  Like going on.  What?  No, this guy.  No, the guy on TV.  This is called the news.  This is.  And they're saying that there was a plane diverted to Boston, and the guy had Vaseline, a screwdriver, matches, and a note referencing Al-Qaeda. 
[03:59:00]  He's one of two things.  You know what I mean?  Because they, everybody that works at the airport in any screening capacity should have to fly with you.  They're not getting on the fucking plane.  Oh, that's a good idea.  What do they give a shit who gets on the fucking plane?  You.  Oh, yeah.  The guy to check.  Then they'll check every fucking person that gets on the plane, because they're not flying.  What do they care?  They don't care. 
[03:59:30]  Fucking auto nailed it.  How did this asshole get on the plane with fucking Vaseline, which is a no-no, and a screwdriver?  He might be crazy, or he's doing it just to see what security gets on.  Well, that's the point, but I guarantee he's not a terrorist.  He might have been a test, right?  He's not a terrorist.  I don't think he's a terrorist either.  This sounds kind of kooky.  No one has a note.  Yeah, I think he was testing the waters.  You don't blow the plane up if you're going to have a note.  You're going to have a note.  What are you going to do, blow it up and hope the note floats somewhere where they find him?  Aw, that'd be nice.  He's a test.  He's just a crazy person who wants attention, or he really wants to see the use of it?  Some kind of a crazy person.  What does Rebecca think of the whole terrorist thing? 
[04:00:00]  Yeah, what do you think?  It's bullshit.  You know what?  It's bullshit.  I think the liquid thing, I think all that, it doesn't matter.  If they really want to bomb, they're going to get a different way of doing it.  So what are we going to do?  The second we stop traveling or having fun, they win.  That's what I say.  I agree with you.  I'm sure.  I say we ban breast implants.  Hey.  Yeah, I am carrying liquid on board.  Well, that's it.  George, you get that one? 
[04:00:30]  Israeli commandos are hot.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  See, she's got liquid, so.  George has the implants.  All right, well, yeah, they're going to bomb us anyway.  Yeah.  They're going to do a, history repeats itself, so.  There's nothing you can do.  It's your time, it's your time.  That's why my teacher flunked me twice.  I'm waiting for 1939 to come back around.  Any scheduling when history is repeating itself?  How did you feel when Nipsey Russell passed away?  Who?  I'm Nipsey Russell. 
[04:01:00]  Nipsey was terrific.  He's an old porn star.  I thought you would know your porn history.  Nipsey Russell.  How old am I?  Gosh.  You shove it in your ass.  Porn history?  And tell a rhyme.  Yeah, but we know the older guys in radio and stuff.  Crap.  I don't even watch porn.  Nipsey Russell was a legend in the biz.  Yeah.  Known for his hog.  And Scatman Crothers was another one.  Yeah.  I can imagine what he did.  He did a move called The Shine.  Yeah.  That was good.  You ever hear the move? 
[04:01:30]  No.  The move was terrific.  No.  Yeah.  It's great.  Girls would come.  They'd look like they got an axe in the chest.  They'd be like moving around.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Amazing.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Give you a tour at a pantry.  Yeah.  Have everything.  Dick was as big as a roast.  A ham.  Yeah.  You like ham, Doc?  And then he wanted to put it in your ass, but I guess you're not supposed to.  Yeah.  He got accused one time of jerking off on the set, which was like a famous moment. 
[04:02:00]  He goes, ain't nobody jerking off, motherfucker.  Yeah.  You got your current flakes.  Ain't nobody jerking off, motherfucker.  That's a great flick.  Yeah.  That's terrific.  I missed it.  Yeah, that was a good one.  A little scatman.  Yeah.  All right, well.  Is that it?  Jesus.  Look at this shit.  I knew it.  What?  What'd you do?  Well, you made us go late, but, you know, we couldn't help ourselves.  We actually couldn't.  We have a conference call we have to do.  Yeah. 
[04:02:30]  Ugh.  Sure you don't want to run over?  Hey.  Oh, my God.  I tell you, they could be boring.  Well, thank you for cumming, S-C-U-M, right?  Yeah.  That's how cumming is spelled on any porn thing or anything.  Yeah.  And I still chuckle.  Yeah.  Cumming.  Well, thank you for having me.  It was a pleasure.  Oh, pleasure.  RebeccaLove.com.  There you go.  Good evening. 
[04:03:00]  What?  How do you fucking end a show like this?  That's just it.  You don't.  She was very badly raped, you see?  By the doll.  No, she's dead.  No.  My health doesn't allow it.
