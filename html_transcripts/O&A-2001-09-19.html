<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast following the September 11th attacks was a complex mix of raw emotion, dark humor, and listener interaction.  The show opened with the hosts reacting to the ongoing news coverage and the public's response to the tragedy.  Numerous callers shared personal anecdotes and emotional responses, ranging from distress to anger.  Opie detailed his experience playing *Tropico*, ironically contrasting his in-game authoritarianism with the real-world events.  He also played a remixed version of Metallica's "Seek and Destroy" created by his brother, Joe, incorporating war quotes.  The hosts discussed and criticized opportunistic advertising, citing examples from Dunkin' Donuts and the Vermont Teddy Bear Company, and also commented on the perceived insincerity of Jay Leno compared to David Letterman’s response to the tragedy.  The broadcast also included a humorous, albeit offensive, bit featuring "retarded Laverne and Shirley" interviewing celebrities.  Listener "Psycho Tim" recounted his protest at a fundraiser, involving a bullhorn and a confrontation with security.  The hosts expressed concern over the excessive detail in news reports regarding troop movements and other sensitive military information. Neil Diamond was mentioned as being in the studio at some point during the broadcast.

The show continued with further listener calls.  Nicole criticized the hosts for injecting religion into their discussions, sparking a debate about religion's role in violence. Levi vividly described the massive shipment of embalming fluid sent to New York, while Caroline highlighted the contrast between rescue efforts and some New Yorkers' continued littering. Patty, a caller working two jobs, discussed tithing 10% of her earnings to relief efforts, prompting humorous interludes from the hosts.  Technical difficulties with the broadcast in Cleveland and other markets led to calls with program directors.

Andrew Dice Clay called in, proposing a 24-hour radio telethon to raise money for 9/11 victims. The conversation with Dice Clay was a blend of serious discussion and offensive jokes.  He suggested various celebrity guests, including Bob Hope, and engaged in numerous comedic bits and impressions, often making offensive comments targeting specific groups.  The hosts and Dice Clay discussed the logistical challenges and potential talent for the proposed "radio thong."  The segment also included listener responses to the radiothon idea, negative reviews of the show, and listener-submitted tribute songs, which the hosts extensively mocked.  Callers both supported and criticized the radiothon and the hosts’ handling of the post-9/11 situation and their humor.  The segment concluded with further banter, discussion of the radiothon, and advertisements for O2Go water and Stacker 2 fat burner.

The broadcast concluded with a repetitive advertisement for "Stacker," including a phone number and radio station call letters (1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W), repeated multiple times.  No guests were present during this final segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And that's what I'm feeling today.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Seek and destroy, seek and destroy.  Pour me a drink and I'll tell you some lies.  Thank you, Neil Diamond.  You bastard.  Old school Metallica, man, with that 80s lead.  The obligatory, yes. 
[00:00:30]  80s lead.  Trying to play some scale.  You need that.  Yngwie.  Yngwie.  All right, if you're in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Master, master, master of puppets are pulling the strings.  Hello, Ken.  Hello. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you, Neil.  Neil Diamond in the studio today.  Anywhere else, 866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW.  I'm getting impatient, my friends.  What's that?  When does the bombing start?  Yeah, everyone.  That's the big question.  You can tell the news people are just dying to get some new news.  I listen to 1010 Winds, the local news station here in New York, and they're just every eight minutes or so rerunning the exact same stories. 
[00:01:30]  There's nothing new.  They taped their reporters doing a story about something.  Fox News alert, Anthony.  U.S. orders more than 100 warplanes to Gulf region.  Of course.  That's where we'll be bombing.  I don't like the whole idea of them telling who's going where kind of thing.  I just heard a bunch of troops and amphibious vehicles leaving Virginia. 
[00:02:00]  Maybe we should just keep that mum.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sure it'd be easy to find out, but let them have to find out through other channels.  I don't care about where they're coming from.  We know where they're going, so maybe we should just shut up about that.  That's a good idea, my friend.  Jack asses.  All right.  Your brother's on the line right off the bat.  Brother Joe.  What's up, Joe?  I'm glad I requested that song with the 80s lead.  Yes, isn't it?  He can destroy.  Isn't that good?  It's great.  It's very good.  Thanks, man.  Where's Joe's version? 
[00:02:30]  It's on its way in.  All right.  We'll play it.  I was so bummed, though, man.  I'm on my way home.  I'm like, oh, wait.  I didn't send it yet.  Brother Joe.  Brother Joe, we told everyone we were going to start the show with that song today.  Right.  What brother Joe was talking about, because no one else knows, because Joe still doesn't know  how to do radio the right way to Joe.  No, I do.  I actually improved on the tune.  All right.  You're bitching, but you're not telling everyone what's going on.  Yeah.  Brother Joe has a really cool version of that song that we'd like to play for everyone today.  When he gets home and he sends it in, we'll play it. 
[00:03:00]  Now, all the all these stations are playing those sappy, you know, songs with the news clips  in there about the, we're here outside the World Trade Center, Ground Zero.  Unbelievable what I'm seeing here.  We're here at Ground Zero. 
[00:03:30]  Opie in three, two.  So, so what Joe did is take Seek and Destroy, and instead of the sappy news things and everything  and what we've been hearing, just war quotes, quotes from the leaders, past, present, and  future, I guess, about war.  I'm racing home.  War.  All right, Joe.  And how we will kick ass.  I'm racing home. 
[00:04:00]  All right.  You'll have it in about a half hour.  All right.  We'll play it as soon as we get it, Joe.  Pull mine.  Thank you.  Later, boys.  So we get to play Metallica again.  Why not?  With the clips in there.  With the clips.  All right.  Where are we going to begin today?  I'm a little sleepy, first of all.  I've got to tell you.  Why?  All the news coverage?  No, I'm tired of the news coverage, but until about 4.30 in the morning or so, I was up  playing Tropico.  That's my new video game fix. 
[00:04:30]  It's not like my normal ones.  I like the first person shooters.  I like games like that.  This one, you have to, you kind of inherit this island.  You look more like a Sims guy.  No.  That is such a joke.  That's a potato chip game where you just sit there with nothing really going on, but it's  entertaining.  I've been on that form of crack when that game first came out.  But this one, you're in charge of your people.  You can control immigration.  So if you need more workers, you open up the immigration. 
[00:05:00]  But to do that, you've got to build an immigration office, very detailed on how you run this  tropical island.  You could pick your politics if you're aligned with, because it starts in like 1959.  So it starts with either a Soviet Union alliance or a United States alliance.  In this game, do you get to find the sleepers?  The sleepers?  No, no, no.  We've been reading about the sleepers.  No, you can't do the sleepers?  No.  No.  That's too bad.  So you have to balance your economy, your population, your popularity, your politics. 
[00:05:30]  Very hard to do.  So I start up the game, and I quickly become disliked by my population.  I'm just trying to make some money, help these slobs out, and what do I get in return?  I check on my list of population, a lot of people in the unhappy column.  They're unhappy with their housing.  I built some nice tenements to put them in.  They're cheap, and they fit a lot of people. 
[00:06:00]  I was a slobler.  I built like, I'm like, who cares?  Because if you don't build a housing, they build these shacks for themselves, and they're  very unhappy with the shacks.  So I build these tenements, and you could set it on normally maintained or roach patrol,  which is a lot cheaper.  So I put it on roach patrol, and I'm packing the population in these tenements, and I notice  they're not happy with it.  I'm paying crappy wages because I need money coming in.  I've got to start somewhere.  I'll give them raises eventually. 
[00:06:30]  So then different political factions, there's militarists, there's capitalists, all kinds  of different political factions that some of these people belong to, they start sending  you messages.  So I get this one, Enrique Caballi, or whatever the hell his name was.  I thought you were going to say Suave.  Enrique Suave.  He sends me a little note saying, I am not happy with the economy.  And you have to change things or people will be unhappy. 
[00:07:00]  And he's the leader of like this, the capitalist group.  So what do you think I should do?  I have him arrested.  I arrest him.  And then anyone else that chimed in that they didn't like what I was doing, I either put  them in prison or had them killed.  This did not help my popularity.  It continued to plummet until there was a military coup, and I was thrown out.  Started a second game.  Now with my girlfriend sitting there at the same time. 
[00:07:30]  Wait, how long did you last the first round?  I didn't last through five years in the game, which is about, you know, an hour, two hours  around there.  So I start now with my girlfriend helping me out, playing along.  She's like, why don't you build a high school?  I'm like, I want to build a high school.  I need like a resort area.  I got any money coming in.  That's too boring.  Build the high school, all of a sudden the people are a little happier, and they're more  educated.  Now they get the higher paying jobs.  She goes, now build a hospital and a college. 
[00:08:00]  This sucks, you know?  But I build those things.  The economy starts booming.  I could build other logging camps.  Now the money's pouring in, and the people love me.  And I don't understand why.  Like, my solution was, the people didn't like me, kill them, or put them in prison.  I had no high school or college, but I had four prisons that I could, like, lock people  up in.  And I couldn't understand why the popularity, I wasn't very popular. 
[00:08:30]  But it's a great little gauge on people's personalities.  Like, she was thinking about the schooling and educating the people so later on they could  get the good jobs and the housing could be better and things would get better.  I'm just like, no, make money for the Presidente.  El Presidente needs money.  Instead, you're like an Afghanistan leader.  I was horrible.  Yeah.  Awful.  Awful.  So, and then I turn around, look at the clock, and it's 4.30 in the morning. 
[00:09:00]  So I'm running on barely any sleep.  So it should be fun today.  I don't think anyone has slept.  And ask Dave, ass from the Bronx, ha, tropical, you pussy, play a real man's game like Red Faction.  I've been playing Red Faction.  Steve C was kind enough to download the demo and burn it to disc for me.  Great game, Red Faction.  I can't wait until the complete version comes out.  And I just got done with Max Payne over the past weekend, which is just poof. 
[00:09:30]  I wanted to get away from the whole tragedy thing over the past weekend.  So I played Max Payne and finished the game 10 hours straight of nothing but violence, killing, and fire.  One thing I like about Red Faction, new game coming out.  And you could take these little mine bombs that they have, they're like charges.  You plant them, and then you have the detonator in your hand.  You could slap them on the people.  And they run around trying to brush it off of themselves as you giggle until you hit the detonator button. 
[00:10:00]  What a game.  So, Dave.  Too bad we can't play the real version of that in Afghanistan.  Wouldn't that be great?  You're just clicking a knock on this off of me.  Boom.  Let's go to the phone and see what's going on.  Frank, you're the first call today, man.  What's up, guys?  You tell us.  I just want to call and say you guys have been doing a great job this week especially.  And your choice of music has been perfect.  Me and my boys went out drinking this weekend.  I could only talk about this thing, and we're hitting up the jukebox and playing the exact same stuff. 
[00:10:30]  Cool.  We're just trying to pump some adrenaline into the system.  That's what we need, man.  We've got to figure out what song to open the show with tomorrow.  Yeah, the news is so depressing.  Definitely needs something to take your mind off it.  All right, man.  Hang in there, Frank.  Also, Red Faction, great game.  I played it for PlayStation 2.  Unreal.  Yeah, it's pretty good.  It looks great on PC.  Yeah, with those mines, you can make all holes in the walls and stuff, too.  There's nowhere you can't go.  It's just...  Yeah, like in a lot of games, you can put a bomb near a wall.  It won't do anything.  This one, everything blows up in the game. 
[00:11:00]  So, if you've got to get through a cave wall or something, boom.  Charge.  All right, boys.  Thank you.  Keep it up.  All right, Frank.  Let's go to Fred.  Tomorrow's opening song.  Turn on your hard life.  When I couldn't get through last week...  Let it shine wherever you go.  When I couldn't get through last week, I found an alternative for venting.  I go through the Brooklyn White Pages.  I find the same people with the last names of the terrorists, and I let them have it.  You should hear some of the replies. 
[00:11:30]  They scream back.  But let me tell you, what a venting alternative, man.  Jesus, man.  You're prank calling.  They destroyed two buildings and killed thousands, and you're prank phone calling.  What am I supposed to do?  I can't get through to you guys.  Your lines are tied up.  I've got to yell at somebody.  You're prank calling people that have the same last name.  That's right.  You're insane.  It pays off, bro.  It pays off.  Feels good.  Keep the prank...  Prank calling.  You got Prince Albert in a can?  You better let him out. 
[00:12:00]  You got Bin Laden in a can?  We don't have to tell you.  That's just ridiculous.  Right?  Let's go to John.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  What's up, John?  I'm sure everybody's been watching the same news that I have, and you've seen all these  major pieces of steel coming out of the trade center down there?  Yeah.  What they should do on the first strike is take all of them big, giant pieces of steel,  cut them into, like, three-foot sections, and send the B-52s over and just carpet bomb 
[00:12:30]  Afghanistan with all them pieces.  Oh, is that great?  Just crush everybody within 4,000 yards.  Just drop the wreckage on them.  Did you imagine those Bombay doors opening up on the B-52s?  Eye beams falling from the sky.  Eye beams and tons of wreckage falling on them.  Yeah, that would be justice.  And then after that, then you throw a few bombs in for kicks, like, just to spread the  parts around a little bit.  Well, of course.  No, there's not much to destroy in Afghanistan.  Well, I mean...  Someone down in Washington was saying if we bomb Afghanistan, it'll just make the rocks 
[00:13:00]  bounce a little more.  Well, did you hear that?  Did you hear what Colin Powell said?  They asked him he was going to use the cruise missiles, and he was like, well, I'm not  going to use a million-dollar missile to blow up a $10 tent.  That's a great line.  I like that.  Okay, man.  Have a good one, boys.  Thank you.  You guys, the phones are ringing like crazy the last 10 days.  So, I mean, I'm just flat out hanging up on people so we can move on to other things.  So don't be insulted, all right?  Let's move along.  As we try to move on to other things on the show today, we want to get as many people 
[00:13:30]  on the air as possible.  Let's go to Lynn.  Hey, Lynn.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  I'm from Boston, and I'm so glad you guys are back.  I don't think I would have made it through the last week without you.  Well, there's a bunch of people in Cleveland bitching that we talk about Boston too much.  Really?  Oh, I love to hear it.  There's so many reasons why we talk about Boston.  I know.  If they were in Boston, they would know and they would understand.  Well, one of the reasons, you know, as far as this whole tragedy goes, Boston plays a  very important part.  Yeah. 
[00:14:00]  Exactly.  They left from Boston.  They lost, you know, at least 100 of their locals up there on the plains.  I know, right?  I mean, they left right from Boston.  I think people are missing that point.  You're absolutely right.  Plus, we just hate our old station no matter what's going on in the world.  Yeah.  And we're getting the ultimate revenge, slowly but surely.  It's nice to channel that hatred.  Right.  The stuff that Rocco says, I mean, is he out of his mind?  Yeah, we shouldn't focus too much on that because we say,  you said what we had to say yesterday.  Yeah.  But also, I just want to... 
[00:14:30]  We're all looking for total humiliation as the fat man tries to, you know,  take advantage of this tragedy as he lives, not on a billboard, but in a really nice,  what, camper or something?  I'm in a camper.  He can't even go the distance.  Down by the river.  He can't even go the distance for a cause.  Here's the guy up in Boston.  A lot of these wacky things going on all over the country.  He's going to live on a billboard.  And instead of living there until they raise the money they want to raise,  he's only doing like three or four hours and he's got a camper on hand. 
[00:15:00]  Hey, I got to take my jumps.  What am I supposed to do?  On a billboard.  Anything on a billboard sucks.  Anything on a billboard, if you're doing something, some kind of wacky thing and it takes place on a billboard,  stinks on ice.  We had a wow logo on a billboard.  Yeah, because it's a billboard.  When you put a sign up on a billboard, fine, that's what a billboard's for.  All right, Lynn, so what do you have to say?  I just wanted to say on it, I mean, you're obviously doing great on the tragedy,  but I didn't get through when you had Richard, Laverne, and Shirley and they were hysterical. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, at the VMAs?  Yeah, that was the best thing you could have done.  You know what?  We were supposed to play all those clips last week, but obviously, you know, something else was going on.  So we should start playing them again.  Yeah, you should, because the people who missed it, oh my goodness.  It's worth it.  All right, we'll play them the rest of the week, Lynn.  Thank you.  All right, thanks for being innocent and punish the guilty.  All right, bye.  All right, bye-bye.  Let's go to Glenn.  Hi, Glenn.  Yo.  Hey, what's up?  You know the morning show DJ on MMR in Philly? 
[00:16:00]  Oh.  No.  Parskew sounds like that, right?  Yeah.  He did a read today for Dunkin' Donuts and incorporated how much it would help to alleviate the pain of the tragedy going to Dunkin' Donuts.  Has anyone else noticed all the crazy advertising out there?  I know.  It's disgraceful.  It made me so uncomfortable to hear, you know, hey, you know, you're real upset.  You should go, you know, take a load off and eat some donuts. 
[00:16:30]  It's like, let's never forget.  And let's also never forget that we have the best prices in town.  Oh, God.  Right?  Yeah.  And don't forget a crawler.  All right.  Thanks, Glenn.  No problem.  Bye.  Bye.  Should we go here?  Yes.  All right.  Psycho Tim.  Psycho Tim, what's going on?  We're going in a few seconds.  I don't know what he's saying.  I don't know what this is all about.  We really don't know what this is about.  Psycho Tim, Psycho Mark's brother.  He's up in Boston, so I don't even know what's going on there. 
[00:17:00]  Yes, Tim.  This is a tough location.  Huh?  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Let's listen along.  Let's listen in.  I got to go in hardcore in the truck.  Let's listen in some of the humiliation.  This could be as hard as trying to find Bin Laden.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  This is the sounds of battle. 
[00:17:30]  Sorry, guys.  What happened?  We couldn't hear any of that, Tim.  Tim.  Tim's running.  Tim.  Tim.  Yeah.  What's up?  Here we go.  Oh, here we go.  We're back in the air again.  Seamus Promotions again, man.  Use your name for this.  Seamus Promotions, man.  What is this?  You're going to use your antenna right there?  Come on.  This is BS. 
[00:18:00]  This is Seamus Promotions.  This is a national tragedy, guys.  Is Seamus Promoting yourself?  The cost are coming right now to get me.  Seamus Promotion, guys.  This is BS.  You're using this national tragedy.  Put it down.  I'm telling him to put down his horn.  I'm getting kicked up by the police right now.  Come on.  The police are kicking you out of there?  I'm getting police kicked out of the police again.  You should be able to do whatever you want.  What's happening, Tim?  I want you out of here.  It's private property.  I want you out of here. 
[00:18:30]  Thank you.  This is my deal.  He hits a siren on the phone.  And the phone hang out.  We lost Tim.  Psycho Tim, if the U.S. Army has soldiers like Psycho Tim is for the O&A Army, we have nothing to worry about.  This guy is ruthless, and he wouldn't do anything.  I've got to tell you what happened, why that happened so fast, because he went to check it out earlier, and there was no one there. 
[00:19:00]  There was nobody there.  So he was the only person that pulled in.  And then he realized as he pulled in, he was the only person.  So the AF people came running over to him.  This was like two hours ago.  And he forgot he had a WOW sticker on the back of his truck.  Oh, no.  So he cruised out of there.  So, you know, they had so many people come to see them.  Well, we've all figured out that Boston's not really too good with security.  Yeah, really.  Gee, they were right on him.  So the fat man, Rocco, is up on his little billboard, and there's Crazy Tim with a bullhorn just making his life miserable. 
[00:19:30]  We're going for complete humiliation.  I wish we could have known what it sounded like on that end.  Well, we'll get Tim back on the phone, I'm sure.  Yeah.  We'll see what's going on.  It's so funny to think that, you know, you take a good cause, and then you try to attach your name to it so you get some press in the paper or on the news.  It's a disgrace.  And that's all that's going on.  Trust me. 
[00:20:00]  We worked there.  We know how Dave Dickless works.  We know how spineless Rocco is.  It's, you know, the whole raising money thing, if the end justifies the means, then fine, whatever.  You know, but you could do it from a studio.  You don't have to get on a billboard.  Make like you stole the station van and got on a billboard.  So hopefully the paper will put your name in the paper along with the money you raised.  It's a disgrace.  It could be done anonymously.  It could just be done on the air, in the studio. 
[00:20:30]  You don't have to do a wacky stunt.  All right.  Well, we'll see if anyone else from the O&A Army stops by for humiliation.  Total humiliation.  Hey, Butch, what's going on?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  How's it going?  Hey.  Yeah, you know what really, really tees me off is, like, like you said, the news has given up too much information.  Do you remember when they were chasing that van in Staten Island?  Yeah.  Right?  And I was listening to 1010 Winds like everybody else was that day just to see what's happening. 
[00:21:00]  And they cut to the reporter who's supposed to be on the road over there.  And he says, well, is there anything new?  Have you seen anything?  And the guy tells everybody, well, we haven't had anything new, but I did pass by an unmarked police car.  And he seems to be reading off a list of possible license plates.  I mean, how retarded is that?  You've got to be kidding me.  Like, this terrorist isn't listening to the news either.  Yeah.  You know?  We have finally figured out that these terrorists are pretty smart people.  So let's keep the info to a minimal, right? 
[00:21:30]  I mean, certain things you just shouldn't let out, you know?  I mean, come on.  Talk about giving away a surprise, you know?  Right.  Yeah, I don't like the whole idea of how they're talking about which resources of the military is leaving which bases and which way they're headed, you know?  I like that.  That's totally ridiculous.  Sucks.  All right.  Well, you guys suck.  Thank you, Butch.  All right.  Have a good one.  All right.  Yes, Rick.  Yeah, but on that note, they actually used the media back in the Gulf War to inform, you know, Hussein where they were headed, you know, giving them basically false reports. 
[00:22:00]  And they came around from a different angle.  So you never know what they're actually receiving and what's the truth.  They're ruining my show.  I can't get over that.  That is too much.  All right.  I hope people find that as funny as we do.  We should play one of these clips from the VMAs.  This is what we were starting to do last week when all hell broke loose. 
[00:22:30]  We had the retarded Laverne Shirley at the VMAs with us.  Of course.  Seems like a lifetime ago.  We're on the red carpet as all the big, huge celebrities were coming in.  You know, that's something that you bring up.  As I'm driving in today, I was looking at a lot of the bus stops here in the city have the ads up in them.  And I saw one for the VMAs, you know, it's obviously old news.  But you look at the date there, it was September 6th.  And you kind of look at that date like, oh, boy, you know, it was kind of, it seemed so long ago and so much happened. 
[00:23:00]  And you think, ah, if only someone knew then what we all know now gets you thinking.  All right.  A million years ago now.  Psycho Tim's calling back in.  Oh, he is?  We're not going to spend too much time on this today.  Don't worry.  It is fun.  It is a lot of fun.  We've got to find out what happened because it was a mess on the radio.  Tim, what's going on?  Well, they had like SWAT teams coming out of the bushes on top of me.  I stood my ground until the guy came down and grabbed me.  But he came right out of the trees. 
[00:23:30]  They're up like on the thing in these trees.  And I was there for a good, like, 30 seconds.  The GM's like, you better move him, sir, before I move him.  I'm like, whatever, dude.  The GM of what?  The station?  I know.  Some guy had confirmation.  Some guy who worked for the station or something.  He comes running down.  Oh, other than a guy.  They have a chick GM over there.  Was it some guy?  Because I'm going to get him.  If you don't move him, the cops, like, first of all.  Hey, Tim, Tim, was it some guy that looked like he had a 70s gay porno mustache?  No.  Then it wasn't Dave Dickless.  Then it was not Dave Dickless. 
[00:24:00]  So, well, first when I pulled in, I had a sign up.  They didn't have an AAF truck up front.  So, the sign was for, like, donations to AAF.  So, obviously, I put a wild sign on it.  Yeah, how many people are showing up for this?  Well, as of right now, it was just me.  Oh, God, that's sad.  That is so sad, man.  And it started off, the fact is that you can't listen to AAF out here because it doesn't pick  up the signal.  That is such a good thing.  It's, like, 12 miles away from anything.  So, the fact is that I would have driven around the parking lot a little small until I got a signal. 
[00:24:30]  How stupid.  And I got a signal.  We've got to explain this to people.  That's like you and I taking our show to Binghamton.  Yeah, somewhere where.  A city where, you know, our signal doesn't come in.  Yeah.  And try to do a promotion and get people to come down to see us.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, so I'm, like, I'm driving on the parking lot real slow until the signal comes in.  And I hit the park all quick.  And, like, I sat there for 10 minutes.  So, I got that one signal in that area.  Yeah.  Then, when I called you guys, they got on the air.  I just put it in gear and flew over there.  It was, like, right up to the front.  And my truck, because it's the only time I could get there in time. 
[00:25:00]  And I only said whatever I said.  And the cop grabbed me.  He goes, if you come back, you're getting the story of conduct.  He goes, if you have any.  He took my license.  I called it in.  And he's, like, he goes, there's an instant report.  He's, like, what are you doing down here?  And I said, listen to the cop.  I said, listen, I had some friends get killed down there in New York.  I was, like, this guy's just self-promoting himself.  It looks like WKRP in Cincinnati, like, what was it?  The super fly, the black dude, I did that on the show.  You know, I was, like.  Venus flytrap?  Yeah, Venus flytrap. 
[00:25:30]  Venus.  There's, like, a 20-foot gorgeous, like, RV sitting there.  There's, like, five or six, like, trappers there that he's hanging out in.  There's, like, a little tent.  And the cop's sort of being cool with me.  The cop was, like, yeah, I guess.  I'm, like, they're probably keeping 20% anyways.  That's hilarious.  Like, he's just promoting himself.  He's not promoting a thing.  You know, it's too self-serving.  It's too friggin' self-serving.  You want to raise money?  Do it with your fat ass behind the mic in the studio with a little respect for the victims of this. 
[00:26:00]  Instead of trying to just get your face in the paper or on the news by climbing a billboard.  Ugh.  The whole time I was there, he was up there for probably five minutes.  And tell the cops to stop, you know, protecting a billboard and go down to the airport there.  Logan Airport.  Yeah.  Well, what he said was, he goes, because what they're doing is they're doing all stuff in private property now.  That way, like, they have the right to be like, get off.  It's private property.  Because I was like, I can stand.  That's freedom of speech.  He was like, it's private property.  I'm like, so what? 
[00:26:30]  And the cop can't get out of my face.  Private property.  Well, we have more O&A Army members on their way.  Perfect.  I'll get pinched if I go back there.  Yeah.  How about going to the airport?  Instead of worrying about Psycho Tim, get Billy Buckner out of airport security and put a couple of the cops in there.  So, well, now they have an ASV out front protecting the sign, because I was going to put another wild sign up there, but there, he protected it.  So he just goes up there when he does his brakes, and then he climbs back down into, Jesus. 
[00:27:00]  The fat son of a bitch can't even suffer a little in the memory of these people and the tragedy,  even though it's a complete self-serving event, he can't even go the distance on that respect and actually stay up there and feel a little of the suffering.  If you even want to go that way, with some say, hey, I'm hungry.  Hey, Matty, I'm going back into the luxury RV.  Yeah, all the restaurants, we did a trade deal with them, so I get free eats for mentions on the air. 
[00:27:30]  Hey, Venus Flytrap, great idea.  Just stealing ideas.  Thank you, Tim.  All right, guys.  See you later.  Anytime you need anything.  Yeah, we know.  Thanks.  There you go, Psycho Tim.  Anthony, so I was saying retarded Laverne Shirley at the VMA is on the red carpet, all the celebrities coming by to go inside,  and we had them interview all the celebrities, or try to. 
[00:28:00]  This is when Bon Jovi walked on by, and we didn't know they were huge fans of Bon Jovi, so they lost their effing minds.  I can't listen to this.  We'll check this out, and we'll be back.  All right, it's the O.P. and Anthony show.  Richie Sambora.  Oh, my God.  Richie.  We love you.  Richie Sambora.  Richie Sambora.  We love you.  Richie.  Oh, my God.  Richie Sambora.  Richie Sambora.  We love you guys.  And I have my hair all living on a prayer.  It's my life. 
[00:28:30]  It's my life.  Watch out my children.  Wow.  It's my life.  Bye.  What else do you say?  It's now or never.  Keep the 14-year-old away from us.  Have a drink.  I want to bang you.  This is normal radio, right?  The O.P. and Anthony show.  I don't know whether the studio and listen to you guys have to drive down there and bash your heads in with a baseball bat.  Uh-oh, this is going to be a rough minute.  Um, Anthony, the Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  You know, I'm looking at this copy and, again, look at this. 
[00:29:00]  Lisa Orban.  Everyone at Vermont Teddy Bear is stunned and grief-stricken.  Do people have to fit this into every friggin' product that everyone's trying to sell right now?  Do you realize it comes off sounding bad no matter how good your intentions are?  Just, you know, you want to have a teddy bear, go to VermontTeddyBear.com.  Talk about the bears.  Talk about talking to a bear counselor.  Birthdays, babies, everything.  Why then?  Let's see what they're doing. 
[00:29:30]  Donating firefighter bears, police bears, and angel bears to the family and children of the courageous men and women who...  Yeah, that makes up for a loss of a parent.  Yeah, a bear.  What?  You're invited to share your love and strength by writing a card to accompany the bear.  Great.  So people can write cards and they get free bears from the thing.  But the VermontTeddyBear.com.  Jesus Christ. 
[00:30:00]  Lisa, that copy is not going to work.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  That just kicks ass.  Love to disturb.  Yeah.  Down with the sickness.  Lydia, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing today?  Pretty good, Lydia.  I just wanted to call you and give you guys a big whopping thank you for this whole week because, I mean, without you guys, I don't know. 
[00:30:30]  You've helped me laugh a little bit.  You've helped me just make this bearable, you know.  And, I mean, you, the whole station, everybody, it's just been great listening to you guys.  And I just appreciate you both so much.  And I don't know what else to say.  I mean, when they answered the phone, I was in tears.  I was bawling.  I was crying.  And, but you guys make it feel so much better.  Make me feel so much better. 
[00:31:00]  A lot of people doing that crying thing.  I know.  I know.  But, um, I got to tell you, yesterday, you guys had me in tears.  And you would do it with Dr. Patty.  And you're reading that note that she wrote, you guys.  Oh, my God.  The aunt.  I almost got into a car accident with my son in the car.  I just pulled the car over.  So funny.  We're just trying to be a distraction.  And if anything happens new with this whole situation, we'll break right in.  We'll let you know.  And then you can switch to the respective news stations.  But I think everyone needs a, we're calling it chuckles. 
[00:31:30]  A little chuckle.  We want some chuckles.  We need a few chuckles.  I know.  You guys are so cute.  I love you guys so much.  Lydia, thank you.  And for the other cities that are picking up the radio show, it's really hard for us to move forward.  Because Anthony was talking about it today.  And you should mention that, Anthony.  The smell of death is in the air now.  Everywhere.  It's awful.  And, um, you know, the wind was blowing over toward Brooklyn last night. 
[00:32:00]  And, uh, when I got home, I parked my truck.  And I got, like, about a block to walk to get to my apartment building.  And the whole way is just, oof.  You can smell it.  It's like when you go out in the yard and, you know, you kind of, you know something's in the bushes.  Uh, it's a smell.  And everybody's having to deal with it around this area.  It's really rough.  Oof.  All right.  Let's move on to Old Dirty.  I've got to say hi to Joe the cop, by the way, from, uh, Bay Ridge. 
[00:32:30]  Why?  My home town.  Hi.  I think I was illegally parked last night.  Instead of a ticket in my windshield, there was a little note saying that, uh, you know,  thanks for, uh, what we've done for the cops and firemen.  And, uh, he's a big fan of the show.  And I was like, oh, did I get a ticket?  You know, so I, oh, that's pretty cool.  And I, I took the, um.  How did he know it was your car?  I don't know.  He might have called it in.  I took the, uh, the police plaque that I have in my windshield to keep from being pulled  over.  I took that off on Tuesday and put it in my glove because I, you know, I don't think it's 
[00:33:00]  appropriate to drive around like with, uh, the police stuff on, on your car, uh, unless  you're, you're a cop or unless we're in peacetime and there's been no problem.  And you took gets me out of tickets.  You took the Simon out of your car too.  I've turned in the, I've turned in the cruiser that they gave me to drive in.  And, uh, but no, uh, the guy, uh, the new cities have no idea how ridiculous it got  for Anthony and I.  It's all started with a little PBA card. 
[00:33:30]  We, we got some ridiculous stuff and we want to thank, uh, the, the, the police guys in  this city.  You know why?  Uh, before this happened, uh, on Tuesday, the new NYPD have gotten some really bad raps  and just been crapped on for years.  And, uh, now everyone's coming forward and realizing, uh, uh, taking these guys for the,  the heroes that they are and the, the hard work they put in for many years before this 
[00:34:00]  happened and that went unrecognized.  These guys were crapped on for years.  If they did something, if they, um, uh, arrested, uh, somebody, it wasn't about, uh, who they  arrested, it was about how the person they arrested's rights were violated.  Now that's all taken a back seat to, uh, the work that, uh, these guys in the fire department  have done.  But, um, you know, I, I remember a couple of weeks back, they were still getting crapped 
[00:34:30]  on and not getting paid, you know, and, uh, still not getting paid.  We've supported the, the NYPD since we got back to New York and even before that.  And, uh, and, uh, so, you know, they, they've helped us out on occasion.  Half our listeners are on the job.  I mean, yeah, I know.  Hey, Matt, what's going on today?  What's going on, man?  I just want to give you guys a quick shout out.  You guys doing a hell of a job.  And I think that, uh, I want to give some props to Howard Stern because I thought he  did a fantastic job last Tuesday. 
[00:35:00]  Sure.  I actually lost my uncle in, in, uh, in the rubbish, um, in the rubble, you know, in the  rubble and, uh, and my mother's really having a hard time dealing with it.  And then, and, and so is the family.  Um, I just feel that, um, the firefighters deserve a huge pat on the back.  And so same with the police department and, uh, you guys deserve a huge, uh, you know,  we got, we got to give props to the iron workers.  Oh, definitely.  All those people that are working down there.  There's a, there's so many people involved with this.  Definitely.  All those people down there, they're just pouring out their hearts and their lives. 
[00:35:30]  And, and that most of them are doing it for free.  And, and I think that's just fantastic.  And, uh, Tim, I have a, you know, I just want to give, uh, you know,  a shout out to those people that are overseas burning our flags and stuff.  And I know a lot of trouble happens over on their waters and in their area of the world.  But, uh, you know, what, what happened here is just, it's, it's, it's, it's terror, you  know, and, and, uh, from what I heard on the radio and, uh, TV last night, that, uh, they're  looking to do another bomb on, uh, 922 because 11 days later, I mean, come on, you know what 
[00:36:00]  I mean?  And, uh, I, I was watching some of the news footage and you saw the people protesting even  in, uh, Pakistan, which is, you know, officially the government there is, uh, behind us, but  a lot of the people not behind us, they were showing some protests going on with a burn in  the American flag.  And these people are hitting the flag, the burning flag with these big sticks.  Ooh, they got sticks run, run.  I bet somewhere in the U.S. military arsenal, there is a stick-seeking missile. 
[00:36:30]  Seriously.  Why not?  Why not?  Someone thought it up.  Stick-seeking missile.  All right, Matt, thank you.  All right, listen, you guys have a great day, man.  All right.  Later.  They coming to America.  Neil, figures he breaks out into song with no apparent reason, man.  John, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up, guys?  Let me just start off by saying, you know, you guys know I love you as I'm on all the  time with you, but I am so tired of everybody calling up and hobbing all the radio personalities 
[00:37:00]  now.  I agree.  I mean, if today, the only thing that's got you through this national tragedy, how little  do you have in your life?  John, thank you.  I wish my life was that easy.  You're the only thing that has gotten me through these compliments we've been getting.  Thank you, John.  John, bringing it back to reality.  Thank you.  We'll touch your ass.  You know, listen, you guys are great, but we're just radio personalities, for God's  sake.  Yeah, we're just doing our little, little part.  That's it.  We're just opening the phone lines. 
[00:37:30]  I know, but you know what?  It's not so bad with you guys, but like on the weekends, you're listening to like TLJ  and you're just like, I just wanted to call and say I was going to jump off the building,  but then you played Bruce Springsteen.  Tell me back.  All right.  Tell me back.  Exactly.  You know, like, Jesus, shoot yourself anyway.  I knew it was getting bad, Opie, when I would go to various places like the New York radio  message board run by radio dentist Alan Sniffen, and I would see people that for the past three 
[00:38:00]  years have ripped us apart like we were out there in nursery wards of hospitals smothering  children.  This is how bad the feeling was with these people toward us, and I am seeing some of  these people actually giving us props and saying what a good job we've done.  I knew it was bad when I started seeing that.  Well, I knew somebody had to start knocking you down a little bit because you had to get  a little too big for the studio. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  I figured let me start.  All right, John.  Good job.  Have a good one, guys.  Bye.  Yeah, enough.  Look, look, look, look.  Ashley.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, just wanted to say, I know you just said, you know, don't say thank you or anything,  but we just started listening to you guys last week, me and my co-worker.  Oh, yeah, where?  We're in Newark, New Jersey.  Yeah, cool.  Yeah, and we just started listening, and we think you guys are actually pretty cool.  Well, thank you.  You're a little crazy, but.  We're very crazy.  It's pretty cool.  And I wanted to say one thing, too.  If you just started listening last week, you really haven't heard what this show's all 
[00:39:00]  about, so you will probably grow to hate us as time goes on.  Probably, but that's right.  Well, thank you, yeah.  And you were saying something.  You were cracking on the guy who called earlier about the, I think he was saying something  about the gyms that are offering discounts or something.  Yeah.  And you were cracking on Vermont Teddy Bear for the same thing, for helping the kids.  What's with that, man?  No, we were complaining about what the Vermont Teddy Bear Company's doing, and we want to 
[00:39:30]  get Lisa, the sales girl, on the air to try to work out the problem.  We've always had a great relationship with the Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  I'm just getting a little bit full of every ad now on TV and the radio and newspapers trying  in some way, shape, or form to attach themselves to this tragedy.  Whether it's a great idea or not, it's beyond me. 
[00:40:00]  But, but just to have to add it into your copy and, you know, I'm just waiting to hear,  have you, the events over the past week have made it very hard to get your F on.  How about horny goat weed?  You know, I'm just waiting for them to tie it in.  And everyone inch, everyone else inch, just holding up, the grow your schlong and extra  inch commercial that shows up.  It's like, you know, what, what's, for every inch you grow, we will donate $25.  You know, I'm just, I, I, I can't get past the fact that it comes off as self-serving 
[00:40:30]  no matter how noble, uh, they're trying to be.  You know what I mean?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, it's great.  I'm glad that we guys, we finally turned into you guys because you're pretty cool.  Well, Ashley, we're going to need some girls whipping them out when we get back to the  WOW promotion, so.  All right, yeah, I'll keep that in mind.  All right.  Thanks.  Bye, Ashley.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Rick, why don't we take a break, Anthony?  He writes things you can never read.  Satan would smack you with his pitchfork. 
[00:41:00]  Rick, we need to play one of these.  Why don't we play the Tommy Hilfiger?  When we come back, we got to talk about Leno.  I thought he did a, I don't know.  Yeah, well, uh, kind of hard to follow up, uh, a Letterman.  Yeah.  A little rough.  I don't know.  Letterman, like, did the job the day before and, and Leno just started off.  You know what?  It looked like he was really, really trying to.  Yeah.  Letterman came off very sincere because he was being sincere.  The emotion was honest. 
[00:41:30]  Um, and he just let himself go.  He didn't care if he presented himself, uh, like that.  Um, Leno, on the other hand, looked like he was trying to say something profound and it just came off looking uncomfortable.  Mm-hmm.  And I think he, it was calculated like he must have watched Letterman and said, all right, I have to do something.  But I also, I want to keep it a little light.  So I'm going to try to put some jokes in it.  And it just, it came off awkward and uncomfortable.  And just the fact that we're reviewing people's emotional reaction to this is sick. 
[00:42:00]  You know, I, I, I was, I, I was feeling kind of lousy as we were watching the tape and going, you know, everyone's watching going, all right, how's he going to handle it?  And how's this person going to deal with it?  That's kind of screwy in its own right.  But, yeah, Letterman was just very honest and, uh, open about his emotions and didn't care.  Seemed like Leno Moore didn't want to go that route of really opening up and being honest.  He seemed calculated.  Right.  I use that word very carefully.  Yeah.  For the reasons you just stated. 
[00:42:30]  But, um, Anthony, as we go to break, retarded Laverne Shirley at the VMAs interviewing the celebrities as they were going inside.  This was some great stuff that we were supposed to play last week again for you because, because it was such a hit.  And then, obviously, you know, what happened, happened.  And, uh, here's the ladies talking to Tommy Hilfiger, the designer.  Yeah.  Tommy Hilfiger, who has sold, you know, billions of clothes.  Right.  And, I don't know.  And you've got to listen closely because they're pretty much telling Tommy that, uh, they wear his clothes. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  No, they don't.  No, they don't.  They wear bootleg Tommy Hilfiger t-shirts, those two.  Yeah, we've got a little dirty in the studio, too.  But here's the clip.  We'll be back.  How are you doing?  Tommy Hilfiger.  I'm very nice to know you're talking at the radio show.  Hey, how are you?  I want to ask you a question.  Who do you think is going to win?  Who do you want to win tonight?  I'm not sure.  Well, I'll decide after I watch them perform.  I know you're a designer.  Do you think a lot of people are wearing your clothes?  I hope so.  All right.  Okay. 
[00:43:30]  We wear your clothes.  We wear your clothes.  No, you don't.  Get a nice suit on, Tommy.  I know you're a dirty.  OB.  You guys are done.  And Anthony.  Wait two minutes.  We'll say something really dumb.  Let's bring in the incest couch.  Anthony, New York Sports Club.  And how is the New York Sports Club latching on to tragedy?  Let's see.

Gentlemen, you were talking about analyzing people's reactions before, weren't ya?  Yeah.  You should have seen the reactions when I found the Japanese film crew on the street this afternoon  and absolutely haggled the crap up on them.  Oh, just losers.  You have a big problem with the Japanese film crews here in New York. 
[00:46:00]  I don't know.  There's small little issues I have.  Little issues.  But how was my brother?  He did well today, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  Your brother was a good soldier today.  He was a great soldier.  That rocks.  That was funny.  Yeah, I made it into ground zero last night.  A couple guys brought me in down there.  Boy, I'll tell you, there's no picture on TV that can describe what it's like down there.  Unfortunately.  You finally got down there, huh? 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, it's just unbelievable, dude.  I mean, you'd think you'd see, like, pieces of phone or computers and stuff like that.  But no, there's nothing.  It's just done.  Pulverized.  Yeah, yeah.  You know how much equipment was in that building?  A lot of people think of the concrete, the walls, the ceilings, whatever.  But you know how much equipment was in that building?  Just furniture.  Gone.  Everything.  Gone.  Just pulverized.  Vaporized.  There's a piece of the World Trade Center that is going through one of the buildings along Liberty Street.  And I think it's about a 45-story building. 
[00:47:00]  But the first 10 floors is a huge chunk speared right through the World Trade Center.  The World Trade Center speared right through this building.  And it just looks like a big knife sticking out.  I saw the satellite picture of before and after.  Right.  And you just see the buildings that were left standing, but the damage done to them.  Dude, they had to take down each.  Those guys standing under, they must have 1,000 guys in a rescue operation right there underneath one Liberty Plaza. 
[00:47:30]  I looked up at it last night.  It's about four degrees twisted to the right.  You can just see it, and it's just ugly.  It's coming down.  They don't know when.  They've got lasers pointed up at all the buildings in case they move a degree each way.  The sirens go off.  There's a lot of buildings that are going to have to come down still.  At least half a dozen.  At least.  Yeah, there was, in time, they had a diagram of the whole area showing the buildings we lost,  the buildings that will definitely have to come down,  and then a whole bunch of other buildings that are, like, questionable, maybe we'll be able to save them. 
[00:48:00]  Hey, you guys are going to come down to the bar down here some night and just come meet some of the guys.  They really want to.  I don't know what that I would like to do.  I don't want to go to the site itself, but I'll hang out in the bar.  That's for sure.  No, but you should definitely come down at some point and just hang out with the guys.  A lot of guys are talking and, you know, meeting me.  They really want to be you guys.  All right, Mark.  We'll be down there.  We'll be down there.  We'll be good brothers, and we're staying safe.  All right.  What is Dave saying? 
[00:48:30]  Dave.  Yeah.  What's up?  Hey, not much, guys.  Hey, I don't mean this to be crude or anything, but I respect what happened, and I really feel bad for everything,  but it seems like the whole damn world.  Hold on.  See what he's saying.  What are you talking about?  Shut up.  Oh, Dave.  We've got to see where his point is.  He hasn't even made a point.  What's the problem?  So we used a word in the wrong way.  Relax.  It seems like the whole country forgot that there was almost 400 people on the plane, 
[00:49:00]  plus another couple hundred people in the Pentagon that got killed.  So everybody's talking about the World Trade Center, which is, I mean, it's terrible.  No, Dave, Dave, Anthony and I are focusing a lot of our attention on the World Trade Center  because we know people that have died.  We're three miles from it.  We smell the death in the air.  I understand, and I'm not kidding.  We have a lot of people that are associated with this show on their hands and knees,  digging up body parts and then calling us crying, guys that I've never thought I would ever see in my life cry.  So we're a little close to this situation. 
[00:49:30]  We haven't talked about all the people that have died on the air.  On the airplanes, we have talked about the people that lost their lives at the Pentagon.  We had a 17-year-old kid that called us late last week that lost his father at the Pentagon,  and he was losing his effing mind on our radio show.  So what the hell are you trying to say?  I'm saying I want more respect paid to everybody.  How do you point out one way we have been disrespectful, Dave?  Go ahead.  By not talking about anything else but New York.  We have talked about it.  Oh, my God. 
[00:50:00]  We've talked about everyone.  This isn't even worth arguing about.  Listen, I'm not trying to argue.  I'm just trying to bring out what I see going on.  You know that in the first hour of the show, we said,  let's not forget about the innocent people that lost their lives in the Boston area on those freaking planes.  I hate people.  I didn't hear that.  I just wanted to make...  And we get complaint emails from people that just don't listen to the show closely.  You know, before you start writing your stupid emails and calling our radio show,  listen to the whole four hours of this show. 
[00:50:30]  You'll have a better idea of what is going on here.  Some people will listen for five minutes,  and we'll talk about, you know, the complete utter tragedy that's three miles to our right here,  and then they're complaining because we're not talking about, you know,  people that died in airplanes, you know, from Boston.  I am not in any way, shape, or form trying to take anything away from that tragedy.  I don't...  Please, believe me.  Just listen closely.  We've covered it all.  Then I haven't been able to listen to the whole show, I guess. 
[00:51:00]  But it's not just you guys.  Every time I turn on the TV, all I see is the cameras looking down on the Trade Center.  So what?  Is there something wrong with that?  Dave.  Did you find out?  No, there's nothing wrong with that.  Dave.  I'm just saying, I've never seen any of the firemen that died at the Pentagon being pulled out.  I've never seen any of the Army guys at the Pentagon.  You don't think the people don't feel that, my brother?  No, I don't.  210-story buildings were knocked down, bro.  There's 5,000 people dead or assumed, you know, missing. 
[00:51:30]  Does that make the people at the Pentagon any less?  No, no.  No one in there, right?  Nobody's seeing that.  Oh, my God.  You are looking somewhere.  Dave, you're insane.  Let me tell you, there's a reason why there's a live shot on the World Trade Center,  and that reason is there's close to 5,200 people that we still haven't found.  54-60.  54-60.  That number's going up every freaking day.  Dude, I'm going to four wakes before Saturday, my brother.  What are you talking about? 
[00:52:00]  Guys, I told you I'm not trying to take anything away from that.  I'm just telling you how I felt in my heart.  Spent too much time, Dave, already.  Okay.  I came in in a good mood, though.  I've had...  Bye, Dave.  He's looking in a direction where he's...  He's one of those guys that, like, argues with people just to get into the conversation.  No, that's it.  There was nothing ever said that would disrespect the people that died anywhere.  And you know something?  He brings up the Pentagon.  How about the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania? 
[00:52:30]  What's the matter, Dave?  You're disrespecting those people by not bringing that up.  Man, you're...  He's looking somewhere for an argument.  Yeah.  Maybe he's just angry.  Maybe he needs some bombing to start, too.  Nicole from Cleveland has a problem with us, too.  Nicole?  Yeah.  What's up?  Nothing.  What's up with you?  Um, I'm saying...  Yeah, baby.  I enjoy your show.  Yeah, baby.  African.  Yeah, person.  Yummy.  Yummy.  Anyway, listen to me.  Okay.  I enjoy your show. 
[00:53:00]  Or whatever.  My friends, they just got me hooked onto your show or whatever.  I'm like, yo, this show is mad geeked or whatever.  Yeah.  And I'm like, this is tight or whatever because I'm listening to it and...  How about we all start by talking English?  Yeah, baby.  Yo, Opie, do.  Are you trying to be funny?  I mean...  Nicole, you just used ten words.  I have no idea what they meant.  Our show is mad.  Okay, let me speak your language.  Yeah.  I enjoy your show.  Do you understand that?  I liked it better the way you said it before, Nicole.  Okay, well, I'm saying it how I want to say it. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  All right, say it how you want to say it.  Stay with the bindings.  All right, anyway, so like I'm saying, I enjoy your show or whatever.  But my only problem with you guys is, like, why do you guys have to bring the religion  into it?  Because that's what this is all about.  No, I'm talking about...  No, I understand.  I understand the issue.  I understand the issue of...  Okay.  ...of, I understand the issue of the Muslims and all that about...  Yeah.  ...that.  That's the bad part.  Yeah, they shouldn't have did that.  But why are you guys bringing all the other religions into it?  Uh, because...  No, I could be talking about...  I have brought this up.  Well, and Pat Robertson. 
[00:54:00]  And not only that, I have brought up the fact that more people during the time we have spent  on this planet as human beings have died in the name of various gods than for any other  effing cause ever.  Indeed, yeah.  And I've had it.  And you could look at...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,  wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  You could look at any religion, anyone, and at some point during that religion's history, 
[00:54:30]  they have figured out that God has told them to go out and kill the people that don't  believe in their God.  and it's hypocritical uh it's it's stories that are thousands of years old passed on when you  can't even pass on a joke i understand if it's got to go through two people it gets effed up  but for some reason some story that uh two thousand years old uh we've got it down some of  the most okay what i'm saying what you're not what you're not understanding what i'm saying is  i understand all that or whatever but now we're talking about now what happened now okay but 
[00:55:00]  you're bringing in all the other religious people yeah falwell is an idiot pat robertson is an idiot  we're just commenting on what's coming out in the in the in the media nicole you should be pretty  outraged by the things jerry falwell and pat robertson said you know how do they how do those  two get microphone time i'm saying we're paying for our sins so but nicole i don't understand what  right what part of what we've said about religion you have a problem with just just disrespecting 
[00:55:30]  my whole religion what is your religion by the way i'm christian i'm a christian all right  well you know and i'm saying christians totally disagree with what the muslims did but what i'm  saying is i don't disrespect anybody else's religion and it's like it's like okay i enjoy listening to  y'all show and everything but then it's like why do you have to disrespect a religion you sing at the  church there in nicole do you nicole yes don't listen to the show do you sing at the church  now she's listening she's listening to the show on the radio nicole is so concerned about uh what 
[00:56:00]  you know what we're doing no she's more concerned about hearing herself on the radio nicole turn down  your stupid radio i don't even have on my radio what are you talking about then what's in the  background i don't know what are you talking about i've had enough by nicole yeah i've had  enough of nicole too now yesterday we uh had a losing our effing mind day today we're back to a 
[00:56:30]  whole day it's just people calling up that i guess they're done they've had nothing else to say so they  gotta uh turn around and and start saying a whole things but you know the atrocities done in the  name of religion yo they're countless though you know what i'm saying it's ridiculous give me a break  man all right listen we gotta move on uh dale from jersey writes did you see the needle that leno  was poking himself with in order to make himself cry last night yo he looked out he he came out 
[00:57:00]  some emotion here but it's uh it's a little difficult he came off so phony and you know  he should just he should have just said anything you know the pressure was on him because of uh the  the great job uh letterman did just the great job he did grieving well no as you look at the great  job you didn't let me finish and it would have it would have saved my ass the great job that  letterman did being a human being exactly his sincerity his sincerity yeah came through there was  no he didn't he didn't sit down with his writers or his tonight show people it was like this is 
[00:57:30]  this is me this is dave letterman just the schmo from indiana that has spent uh many years in new  york and this is how i feel actually uh leno said something last night that was a tad questionable  and it's appropriate it was just something about the plane like a piece of the plane uh hitting  someone in new york it's it kind of yeah i got cringed when i heard it i went oh what of course 
[00:58:00]  well let's listen to what leno had to say last night okay all right yeah go ahead let me tell  you why uh we're here tonight uh as you know it was one week ago today and this is our first show back  and now we're back because the president of the united states the mayor of new york  i've asked us to try and get back into some sort of routine get back into what we  what we normally do those of you watching at home uh if you don't know this we do not do our show in 
[00:58:30]  new york we are in los angeles hence the l.a background horrible horrible images on tv  uh i i can't imagine how horrible they must be  our prayers go out of course to the victims the victims families  the new york police department and fire department to see 300 people literally march into a building 
[00:59:00]  not much chance of coming out to save people we've met to see average americans i mean just anybody  here fighting with terrorists on an airplane to protect that airplane from crashing into the  capital of the united states you know we hear so much about the greatest generation and these people  are certainly the greatest people of our generation it's just an amazing amazing story and you know  you know dogs are funny too why why the applause after that well you know people are very uh patriotic 
[00:59:30]  right now all right let's hear the other clip oh my god why does it sound like uh jay is in some  rapid boiling water what is the quality of that damn recording sounds like he's standing in a rolling boil  doesn't it the spaghetti's almost done yeah boiling boil you know in a world where people fly airplanes 
[01:00:00]  into buildings for the sole purpose of killing innocent people a job like this seems incredibly  irrelevant you know normally i would be out here making fun of democrats making fun of republicans and  you realize we don't have democrats republicans anymore we only have americans we have americans united  in one goal for one reason you know it's hard to believe nine days ago the biggest story in the united

[01:13:30]  going on for a couple weeks we obviously have a problem return our calls oh boy hey the main reason  i'm calling is hey i gotta say something the guy that was calling you earlier that said you weren't  giving enough attention to everything yeah the guy's a moron well he has a moron i've listened  to so many stations the day this happened and the day after it happened the day after it happened the  majority of the stations out there radio stations any kind of radio stations country rock it doesn't  matter we're not saying a word about it nothing the day it happened uh uh 98.1 w kdd in akron didn't 
[01:14:00]  say anything about it they stopped the music like once every 10 minutes and would say one little  thing about it and go right back to playing music well you guys even from akron you guys had the most  awesome coverage you have made so many people aware of what's going on this guy just needs to wake up  and smell the roses he needs to go get his head out of his butt and listen to the radio more often 
[01:14:30]  all right thank you jeremy thanks thank you cool let me uh heather did have something else to say  from akron heather what's up yeah i basically wanted to just say the same thing that that guy  said he you know five minutes ago you had that guy a lot of lives were lost and that's a terrible thing  but that's why god gave the women the ability to reproduce i mourn those people's deaths but our  economy was in those two buildings our livelihood was in those two buildings and i believe that's why 
[01:15:00]  a lot of people give that the most coverage it's not about who died a lot of people died innocently  yes that's a terrible thing but yeah it's not about who gets the most coverage the pentagon  uh new york city uh the people in the middle of uh the woods in pittsburgh exactly right and  it's a terrible tragedy that affects everybody and it's just a shame that something like this had to  happen before everybody could come together all right thank you heather thanks we got the board  up from cleveland hold on let's go to uh dan hey dan what's up dan you guys got me yeah what's up what's 
[01:15:30]  up all right our engineer is working on the problem right now what it is is we're having a problem with  our satellite dish and we have a storm rolling through and any little storm that comes through  sometimes knocks you guys off the air real quick temporarily and they what go to a song well i  uh we don't want to have dead air so i i'll throw in a song really quick right to you guys right 
[01:16:00]  till i pick the satellite back up and i'll throw you guys on the engineers working on it right now you  know we take pride in our show why wouldn't uh the people in cleveland tell us this has been going on  for two weeks this hasn't been going on for two weeks it's just happened today and every once in a  while or or if it happens every time there's a storm that's kind of god damn what what the hell is  this little house on the prairie i've called before and and let you guys know what's going on it's the  21st century shouldn't we have equipment that doesn't do that in the rain so i mean this it's 
[01:16:30]  not our equipment here but it's it has something to do with the satellite dish that sends you guys to  us isn't aren't satellites in space i don't think the rain hits unbelievable well you were gonna have  to do something about that because now we're also hearing that um in san francisco oh yeah they cut  us off uh and go to uh country music and here's how to happen how it happens we'll say we'll be right 
[01:17:00]  back let's leave you with some retard of the vernon shirley right they cut it right there no no we're  still in our show we're playing little bits going into commercials and then they cut instead of  hearing retard of the vernon shirley they will cut away to whatever they are a country song yeah at  least we're not playing country music yeah yeah at least we're not dumping out of you guys and going  into like garth brooks or shania twain or something we all have to get on the same page  and if things are happening that there's a problem you gotta we should all be able to let us know we're

It seems like a lot of your callers are idiots.  Yeah.  Where are you from?  I'm from Virginia.  Oh, okay.  I thought you were that guy from Texas.  Yeah, they haven't reported any firemen dead down here,  and you've got that one guy reporting about all the firemen dead in the Pentagon and everything.  You've got 300 brothers up there in New York dead, at least. 
[01:24:30]  And there's no boundaries here.  Oh, our city got it worse than your city did.  This is tragic for the whole country.  Oh, you're right about that.  All right, man.  Yo, how's Water Country USA, dude?  I haven't been there yet this year.  Water Country USA.  No, we're not there, dude.  What?  Down by which garden?  Awesome.  All right, Tom.  Thank you.  All right, y'all.  Hey, we're going to take a break, Anthony.  On the way, we've got to play some of these tribute songs that people are sending us. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  Awful.  Also, your brother's version of Seek and Destroy.  Seek and Destroy.  It's been downloading for the last hour.  Takes a while.  The Internet sucks today, man.  There's all kinds of viruses and worms.  So, the Internet, I can't get on any sites today.  And Andrew Dice Clay on the radio next.  Oh, yeah?  His first appearance since we got syndicated. 
[01:25:30]  It's actually Dice calling up.  It's not like a gag or anything.  He hasn't called us in quite a while.  He called me with an idea last night.  Hey, I'm wondering, how does this tragedy affect the midgets?  Oh!  So, I learn the news.  I'm banging this hooah.  And I hear about this tragedy.  Oh!  These towel heads.  Oh!  So, he has an idea that he wants to put out there for everybody. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, boy.  Okay.  Hold on to your seats.  I guess.  Should be fun, right?  And even though we're going to say, we're going to take a break, but we're still doing  a little show here, so don't cut out right now, okay?  Yeah, not until you actually hear the commercial portions start.  That's right.  We want to play another little clip from the VMA's Video Music Awards.

[01:26:30]  they are talking to Nate Dogg, and in the middle of talking to Nate Dogg, they thought  they saw Kato Kaelin.  Kato Kaelin!  On the red carpet.  They got really excited.  Nate, excuse me, sir.  What is your name?  Nate Dogg.  How are you?  Excuse me.  What's your name?  Nate Dogg.  Nick.  Nate Dogg.  How are you?  Nick.

Nice sunglasses.  I had it made.  One of my friends made it.  Okay.  Nice.  Okay.  Nice outfit.  I wish you a lot of luck.  Well, thanks a lot.  Okay.  All right.  What do you sing?

[01:29:00]  1027 WNEW, New York.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Thanks for checking us out.  Our buddy's on the line.  We haven't talked to him on the radio since we got simitated, Anthony.  Yes, this is the first exposure of Andrew Dice Clay to the national market.  Andrew Dice Clay.  Hello?  It's the Dice Man.  Dice. 
[01:29:30]  Talk up, I can't hear you.  You can't hear us, really?  Yeah, it's hard to hear you.  No one else is having a problem today.  Cleveland is.  Yeah, well...  Yeah, I heard about that.  All right, can you hear us now?  Yeah, I can hear you pretty good.  All right, what's up?  Yeah, how are you guys doing?  Pretty good.  All right, you know, things going on.  No, I know.  And I actually wish I was calling under better circumstances.  Yeah.  You know, and, you know, the first thing I have to say is, I mean, we all know what an 
[01:30:00]  awful tragedy this is and how horrible it is, and I personally want to say how my heart  goes out to all the families and the firemen and the policemen that have lost people.  You know, it's just a terrible thing.  Inconceivable, this whole thing.  It is inconceivable, but what you have to remember is that, you know, this country has 
[01:30:30]  been built on such a strong foundation, you know, and when you have a strong foundation  like we have, you could really carry a lot on your shoulders.  And even though this is an awful thing, I mean, everybody is going to do their job.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, just like the firemen have been doing and the police and obviously New York has the  greatest mayor in the history of New York. 
[01:31:00]  Julianne, he's done a great job.  He's shown leadership.  Yeah, certainly shown.  Amazing.  I mean, these people are heroes.  They're courageous.  I mean, just all the volunteers, everybody wants to be part of this.  And Dice, don't forget about the dogs.  The who?  The dogs down there.  Yeah, and all the dogs.  Well, no, I'm serious.  You know.  What do you mean the dogs?  There's dogs down there.  They got the dogs down there.  They're trying to search for people.  You know, the rescue dogs, they have that thing under their neck, you know. 
[01:31:30]  All right, well, the dogs don't understand English, so they don't see what I'm trying  to say.  What?  Dice.  What?  Are you wearing a big leather jacket with the American flag studs on the back?  Yeah, I got my American flag jacket.  You got that one?  Yeah.  I always liked that one.  You know, I just want to get this across to you.  Okay.  You know, because, you know, I'm listening to it.  Dice, we're not making any jokes.  Seriously, there's a lot of dogs down there.  And a lot of people are pissed off that the dogs aren't getting, you know, the attention. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, so you're not kidding me?  No.  Well, feed the dogs.  Well, they didn't have dog food, so then they put a word out on the radio and they started  collecting dog food for the dogs.  And then they needed a little, little, what, Anthony?  The Scorch Fund.  They needed, like, dog booties, and we got them that, too, because they were crawling around  in the rubble, cutting their little paws.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.  Yeah, but, yeah.  We're kidding.  We're not kidding. 
[01:32:30]  I know.  You're goofing on me.  You know, I'm trying to call in and be serious about something.  I'm getting ready to hit somebody in the face with a pipe.  Dice, calm down.  You know what I mean?  Dice, calm down.  First of all, we're not kidding with you.  That's just one of the things that's going on.  But you know what?  Even if you are kidding, I think that's important, because I think at this point, you know, everybody,  you know, besides, you know, all the volunteers and firemen and police have to do their job.  And if you guys are kidding, that's okay, because that's what your job is. 
[01:33:00]  And I think your job is also to lift and help, you know, lift the spirits of the city and the country.  Right.  You know, and one of the reasons I'm calling in is because I would like to do a thing with you guys, which is, you know,  I hope we could do this, which would be a radio telethon, a 24-hour radio telethon.  24 hours? 
[01:33:30]  24 hours where we get all kinds of entertainment, not just comedians, rock stars, performers that will talk,  maybe politicians, and raise all this money to give to these families and the police and everybody that needs it immediately.  This is a We Are New York emergency telethon.  And, you know, I would like everybody involved in this, and, of course, I want to do this with you guys. 
[01:34:00]  And, you know, even thinking about it, you know, and I hope I'm not going over the line here.  You know, I know in the past I have had problems with Howard Stern.  You guys have had problems with him.  But I have no more problems with him.  Oh, yeah?  Because all the nonsense that we do all year long, all the petty nonsense goes right out the window now.  Everybody is friends.  This is the time that I feel that everybody has to get together and unite because that's what we are. 
[01:34:30]  You know, this is the United States.  This is, you know, the greatest country in the world.  And even though this thing happened in New York and in Washington, we are all connected, and that's what makes us the United States.  And this thing that happened, in my opinion, in the greatest city and the greatest country in the world, you know, has to be taken care of.  You know, and I don't like when I hear people saying, you know, we were a great country. 
[01:35:00]  Let me tell you something.  We were, we are, and always will be the greatest country ever.  You know, and, you know, I just want to say this, and then we can talk about whatever you want because, you know, I mean, you know what happened is awful, and it's something that, you know, we never thought would happen to us.  But it did, and it hurts, and, you know, and people can't make sense of it. 
[01:35:30]  And that was the intentions of these animals that did this, to knock us down and keep us down.  Right.  But let me tell you something.  That could never happen because New Yorkers, whether you're from the boroughs or New York City or upstate New York, have the spirit and more heart than all of these third-world garbage countries put together anywhere.  This whole country of ours will now bond together, and I think will rise to the occasion. 
[01:36:00]  Nice.  It took you a week for the speech?  No, I'm just trying to talk from my heart.  You know, I'm going to smack you in the mouth in a second.  Let me tell you something.  We were in here on Tuesday and Wednesday last week, and a lot of the same sentiments coming from a lot of people, and now you're calling.  It's over a week later, and now you've got the arrest.  I took the call, and I knew you would be on the air, and a lot of people would be listening.  All right.  And I knew that the day or two after, there wouldn't be that many people listening. 
[01:36:30]  Right.  You know, I mean, but you know what?  I am from that city.  You know that.  I'm from Brooklyn, and stop playing the music.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  You've got to stop playing the music, really.  I'm going to get mad.  I think it's a nice background.  You know?  Well, I'm having a hard time thinking when you do this.  Nice.  It's the national anthem.  Yeah, we're feeling it right now.  Come on.  I'm just trying to say something to you.  This is the one time I'm calling in, you know, serious, and you're jerking me around here. 
[01:37:00]  Well, you know, I liked what you were saying, so we figured a nice background music for it.  All right.  Well, shut it off.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Anthony with the buttons.  I don't have a button.  I'm not playing this.  What do you want?  What do I got to give you?  Jokes?  No.  I'm not going to go into that now.  I liked what you were saying.  Continue talking about the filthy animals.  All right.  Why can't they teach driver's ed and sex ed in that third world country? 
[01:37:30]  It's too hard on the camel.  I mean, what kind of jokes?  There you go.  What do you call a chink and a jap driving around in a Trans Am?  The gook's a hazard.  You know what I mean?  What do you want?  What's better than ten fingers on a piano?  Two lips around my organ.  We're not doing jokes today.  You know what I mean?  I like that.  No, I'm just trying to talk about this thing.  All right.  I'm hanging up.  No.  Don't.  I'm hanging up. 
[01:38:00]  I want to talk about this telephone.  Don't hang up.  All right.  Yeah, you're going to be like...  You know what?  You think it's a big joke.  Yeah, no.  But you got all these kids out there.  I'm not talking.  I'm hanging up.  No, Dice.  Don't hang up.  I'm hanging up.  You're getting me mad.  It's almost over.  You can't cut it off in the middle.  It's the National Anthem.  So it's almost done.  Really?  Listen to this note.  This is from the Chicago Yankee game last night where Mrs. Butterworth got up and sang  that great version of the first thing about our National Anthem. 
[01:38:30]  There we go.  All right, Dice.  You know something?  You guys are morons no matter what.  Well, I'll stop it.  You're just morons.  Stop it.  We thought it was appropriate.  You know I always call in as a dummy and I do stupid stuff.  I'm trying to say something.  No, we don't say that to your face.  Never.  Let me ask you something.  Neither of you guys got kids yet?  Dice, you were being very patriotic and we just thought...  Do any of you guys have kids yet?  To date?  Oh! 
[01:39:00]  You know what?  You know what?  It's good that you're doing this.  You're making me lose, too, because you know what?  All right, come on.  I've got to be honest.  I was a little uptight about calling in because I wanted to, you know, say something really  good.  Yeah.  So you wrecked it?  No, no.  We didn't wreck anything.  I'm just making a point.  I think you made a great point.  Hold on.  Let's regroup.  Okay?  All right.  No, we're okay.  Wait.  We didn't wreck anything.  This radiothon sounds like a great idea.  What Anthony and I have been going for the last few days is a few chuckles. 
[01:39:30]  So that was a little chuckle.  No, no.  And that's all right.  That's why...  Just want to leave a little steam, a little texture.  That's why I gave you the chink joke.  All right.  Well, we were hoping it would, you know, make someone chuckle.  You know, you started in with the dogs.  You know what I mean?  Hold on.  Hold on.  That's true.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Wait.  Where do you find a dog with no legs?  Hold on.  Right where you left them.  I mean, you want dog jokes?  Wait.  I'm putting you on with Melissa for a second because you have to believe this.  Melissa?  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Hey, Andrew Dice Clay's on the line, live from L.A. 
[01:40:00]  I was...  I volunteered Friday night at the armory for about four hours, and one of the things that  we're requesting that people send in is dog food and the booties so that the dogs have  stuff.  They're not BSing you.  They're telling you the truth.  All right.  Well, you know what?  If there's no dog food around, give them regular food.  Yeah.  You can't give the dogs regular food.  They're good.  Yes, you can.  I got a dog.  He eats prime rib every day.  Yeah, well, that's some dogs.  You can't give all dogs.  And another thing...  All dogs can eat regular food. 
[01:40:30]  You just don't want them to eat regular food because it's more expensive.  No.  I just don't like to give my dog regular food.  And when dogs are being dysphoric and trying to help out, you know what?  You throw them a steak.  Right.  Who's looking?  All right.  Well, anyway.  All right, Melissa.  As long as you're getting...  All right, Melissa.  All right.  And I just want to say to Owen, thank you very much because one of my...  My company was in one of the buildings.  I got his hair.  Okay.  There she goes.  I think with them all...  Melissa, you're breaking out, so I'm going to let you go.  All right.  Dice, enough with the chuckles, so... 
[01:41:00]  Melissa, I mean, what am I even talking?  Was she good to go?  No, she's a listener.  It's funny.  You really don't believe us on the dog thing.  We have a...  We have a...  She sounded out.  I think you're playing with me.  We have a radio friend...  I got a dose of kiwi cream for her.  We have a radio friend up in...  Where is Scorch?  Utica, Syracuse?  We never know where he broadcasts from, and he's...  I just called in because I think we should put this telethon together.  It's a radiothon.  Right.  Yeah, a radiothon.  All right.  Telethon is television.  I just think, you know, we need to encourage each other at this point. 
[01:41:30]  Right.  You know, and help each other.  And, you know, even more important than, you know, what we're doing now, you know,  the future of these children that have lost loved ones, you know, are going to have to,  you know, live with this.  And by us doing this kind of telethon, you know, these things will be remembered.  And I think, you know, it's just our way of even more than giving the money. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  You know, it's our way of showing that we care about them and we love them.  You know what I mean?  So, a radiothon.  This was just the most awful thing that has ever happened.  And this is our country.  And this is, you know, a country, you know, where, you know, anybody has been free to pursue  any dream and reach any goal.  And where kids go to school and when they graduate school, they're free to pursue whatever dream 
[01:42:30]  they want to go after.  But most important, what I feel, is that the beauty of this country is that we have always  had freedom without fear.  Even the midgets.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you?  Yes.  And don't be stupid.  Why?  Because while the president and the military do their job, it's our job now to bring entertainment  to people and make them laugh. 
[01:43:00]  How does this radiothon, how is it going to work, Dice?  I don't know.  You're the big brains.  Who's going to be like the Jerry Lewis guy?  Well, I'll be on the West Coast.  You'll be on the East Coast.  You could be like Jerry.  I think we could set it up.  Don't make me get stupid.  Because when I get stupid, I lose it.  You look more like Jerry than we do.  You could be like the Jerry Lewis.  Well, actually, waitie.  See?  There you go.  Waitie.  Did you see Jerry this year?  You'll never walk alone. 
[01:43:30]  Oh!  You know, coming out, singing that song.  Na, na.  Na, na, na.  Na, na, na, na.  So you'll be Jerry Lewis.  I think Jerry Lewis ate all the dog food.  That's why they couldn't find any.  Can we have a tote?  What happened to him?  You fat son of a bitch.  What happened to Jerry?  I actually thought it was a fat guy impersonating Jerry.  Yeah, that's what he looks like now.  You know, and I'm not looking to make fun of Jerry.  I love Jerry.  All right, so you're...  But what went wrong?  You're Jerry Lewis.  What is he, eating those kids? 
[01:44:00]  We get it.  We heard those.  Did you really?  Yeah.  Somebody's stealing my jokes.  I can't believe this.  Yeah, fourth grade.  There's something new.  Yeah, so go ahead.  What were you saying?  All right, so you're Jerry Lewis.  Ant and I, who are we?  Who's like Ed McMahon?  Who's Ed McMahon?  I'm Paul Anka.  You're going to be Paul Anka?  Doesn't he do it?  All right, you could be like Wayne Newton or something.  All right, so how is this thing going to work?  We do 24...  We set up a studio on the West Coast.  We do 24 straight hours. 
[01:44:30]  You're with us the whole time?  We do 24 straight hours.  Or are you going to pull a Jerry Lewis on us and do five minutes here, five minutes there?  I need it now.  No, no, we do the 24 hours.  I'm dying.  We're bringing all kinds of...  Anthony.  Yeah.  Believe me, if I was there, I would have to break your wrist.  What do I like doing?  I would just have to do karate on you.  We're having fun, right, Dice?  We're having fun, but, you know, we're trying to set this thing up.  Yeah.  You know.  All right, what's your big idea, Anthony?  I don't have one.  I have no idea. 
[01:45:00]  Talk, talk, Dice.  Dumb as milk, this guy.  All right, what do you feel...  And I thought I'm a moron.  I know.  All right.  What do you think?  What do I think about what?  I think we should steal a van and sit on a billboard.  No.  That's an idea.  All right, go ahead, Dice.  Dice wants to be serious.  What should we do?  Yeah.  No, I'm telling you what we have to do.  All right, well, you got a studio out on the West Coast.  We got one here.  You got to get me one.  You're with a big radio station.  How are we going to get people...  And we'll get the talent.  My agents...  How do we get the talent? 
[01:45:30]  Well, my agents are really going to help with that.  You know, they got a lot of, you know, they got a lot of big talent.  You know.  Who would you like on the show?  I don't know.  What do you got?  We'll try to get Metallica.  Tartop would be nice.  You know, they got Billy Joel.  They got everybody.  Oh, yeah?  You know.  Stop with the music.  It's very confusing to a mind like mine.  Gallagher?  Can we get Gallagher to smash...  We'll get a lot of comics.  We'll get some water in there today. 
[01:46:00]  I know.  Jim's not here.  What happened?  I spoke to him late last night.  He said he's coming down there.  He's around here somewhere.  Well, where is he?  I don't know.  He's not in the studio.  What, is he analyzing women's urine?  Where is he?  I don't know where he is.  I'm serious.  You know.  You got to stop with the music, really.  Jimi Hendrix.  I know who it is.  Oh.  We can play this as we go to the toad board.  Okay.  Well, you know what? 
[01:46:30]  Let's go to the toad board.  When do you think we could do something like that?  I want to thank the McDonald's Corporation for their generous check.  You stupid ass.  Oh, we're going to get all the celebrities.  You know, you turn the golden arches upside down.  It looks like a big yellow ass.  It's my joke.  It's another one of my jokes.  Can we get Yakov?  Yakov Smirnoff?  We're going to get everybody.  What the country.  I think once we announce this, a lot of people want to be involved. 
[01:47:00]  Can we get Paula Poundstone to fondle a child?  Well, if we can't, you got Norton sitting there.  Shut the music.  This is a great version.  How much heroin did Jimmy have in his system during this?  How much heroin was pumping through Jimmy?  All right.  Obviously, you don't want to do this.  Well, we want to do something to help.  I think Radio Thong is a good idea.  You think it could work out? 
[01:47:30]  Well, they're doing a TV telethon Friday, right?  Yeah.  All the networks.  I don't know what they're doing on TV.  Who's doing a TV telethon?  All the networks getting together to simulcast a huge benefit.  Well, how are they going to do that when it's all different channels?  They're a bunch of idiots.  But they're going to get Tom Hanks.  Well, of course, you know.  He's been in war for the last 30 years already.  Britney Spears, I believe.  Yeah.  Did we get Britney Spears on our Radio Thong?  Yeah, maybe.  Ooh.  She's nice, right? 
[01:48:00]  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  But we got to move on this thing.  All right.  So where do we go from here?  I don't know.  It's your radio station.  This is what I keep saying to you.  We got to set a date.  We got to start getting the town.  Roll a dart.  Roll a dart.  So, Dice, what are you saying?  You'd be willing to go on a station that we supply out on the West Coast,  and for 24 hours, if I could use the term, 
[01:48:30]  you're going to put yourself out there.  And be with us and raise some money?  That's right.  Shut the music, Anthony.  I swear, when I see you, I'm just going to choke you to death.  See, I'm going to get choked by Dice for something I'm not doing.  Would I turn music up this loud if I was playing it and I'm trying to talk?  It's blasting.  Here it is.  It's almost a ring.  Jimmy still had the needle hanging out of his arm playing this. 
[01:49:00]  I think he used it as a slide on the fretboard.  Amazing.  I like Dice's idea.  I like it, too.  Dice, you mind if we do it, though, without you?  Dice, you mind if we do it, though.  Hello?  Is that a hang-off?  Dice.  I'm not talking to you now.  Oh, see, now you're playing games.  Well, I'm mad at you now.  Now you're playing games.  I'm mad.  How could you be mad at a time like this? 
[01:49:30]  I'm mad.  I haven't called in.  I called with something good.  Yeah, it's a very good idea.  You know what I mean?  We like it.  We're just suspicious.  You're going to be up for 24...  What do you mean suspicious?  Don't be suspicious.  You know what?  The people listening, if they think it's a goof, it's not going to turn out the way we want.  No, it's not that.  You're going to be up for 24 straight hours.  Yes!  It's nothing new to me.  I haven't slept in 18 years.  Look at me.  Is this like the Dice that we saw as the postal worker on that Fox TV series a few years back? 
[01:50:00]  What are you talking about?  I mean, this is a sensitive, serious dice.  You know something with what happened, you know?  Hickory dickory dog.  Bin Laden can suck my...  Ow!  You know?  You're going to do some different rhymes?  The one thing those people did do smart.  Yeah.  You see that women had her covered like with handkerchiefs, giant handkerchiefs?  Right.  And they're never schooled and they're just used as bang puppets?  That's the only thing they ever did smart in that country.  Bang puppets?  Bill, I like what? 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, bang puppets.  I can't say the F word.  It's one of your rules.  All right.  Bill, on line one, loves Dice's radio thong idea.  Do you think, um...  Radio thong?  Like a thong?  What are you talking about?  The bang puppets?  No.  You said radio thong.  You ever see those women?  You ever see their heads?  Yeah.  I mean, no.  They're always wrapped up.  Yeah.  Let's see them headless.  Anything with hair on it.  Anything with hair on it.  Hey, people are already pledging money, so you're on to something. 
[01:51:00]  No, I'm telling you something.  This could, you know, it'll be the first radio thong ever.  Thong?  Not thong.  Thong.  Thong.  Radio thong.  You know what?  Call it a radio thong.  Have some filthy slobs come in.  Have them move some, uh...  You know what I mean?  Radio thong.  Radio thong.  Da-dung, dung, dung.  That'd be like Relief Girls.  You know what I mean?  People are loving the idea. 
[01:51:30]  They're all...  Yeah.  I mean, you know...  We just feel like we're going to do all the work, though.  And you just...  No, you're not going to do all the work.  I'm going to be there.  All right.  You know, everybody is down.  We've got to raise the spirit.  That's what I'm talking about.  Radio thong.  You know, and you're not going to get me off this.  What?  You know.  I mean, I'm just as down as you guys are.  Yeah, I see how down you are.  Which way?  Radio or thong?  Which way?  Bosco or you bet?  You bet.  That's right. 
[01:52:00]  That's right.  Which way?  Paper or plastic?  Paper.  Oh.  That's plastic.  That's right.  Paper or plastic?  It's always plastic.  No, it's not.  Oh.  That's right.  Paper or plastic?  Plastic.  No.  Who cares?  No.  What do you mean, who cares?  I hate paper.  No, I thought that was the answer.  Who cares?  No.  No, that's not who cares.  Oh.  Who cares is a whole different bit.  Oh, I see.  Who cares?  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Medium.  No.  Medium rare. 
[01:52:30]  Right.  Of course it's medium rare.  All right.  Did we go through this?  Now, if you want to play, we can play.  All right, so we like the radio thong idea.  Are people calling in?  They like the idea?  People like the idea.  I have to piss at you for goofing on it.  No one's goofing on it.  Yeah, because you guys are morons.  No one's goofing on the idea.  We're goofing on you.  You know, how many markets are you in?  Can we raise about $30 million overnight?  You think so?  In 24 hours?  Yeah.  If you bring your Hollywood friends for it.  Do you think Howard would do this with us? 
[01:53:00]  No.  Are you willing to let bygones be bygones?  No.  Yes.  No.  Yeah, that's what it's all about.  What, being phony?  No.  We have to all of a sudden...  Be whatever you got to be to raise the money we want to raise for this.  We got to make like we're friends?  We are friends.  There is no more fighting.  No more fighting?  We love fighting with you.  No more fighting.  We love fighting with you.  No, not with me.  There was an old Muslim lived in a shoe.  Had so many children, her uterus fell out. 
[01:53:30]  Oh!  It's going to happen.  It's going to happen.  Are you going to sing any songs?  Yeah, I'm going to sing.  I'm over here now.  And then the new Na Na song, which I gave you a preview of.  Right.  Yeah.  All right.  Can you sing that song?  The Na Na song?  Yeah.  I forgot.  Na Na Na Na Na Na.  Na Na Na. 
[01:54:00]  Thanks, you sound retarded.  Oh, wait.  It might have been getting to something there.  What do you mean retarded?  Go with it a little bit.  You're allowed to make fun of retarded people.  If you went over to a retarded person and said,  Hey, are you retarded?  Do you think he'd know?  You see what I'm saying?  Let's hear the Na Na thing.  Na Na Na Na.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  See, he's going to call back now all pissed off, and I want him to know Opie hung up.  I did not hang up on Anthony Ice Clay. 
[01:54:30]  I would never do such a thing, Anthony.  I like his radio thong idea.  Da-dong, da-dong, da-dong, da-dong.  Dumps like a truck, truck, truck.  Let me see a what, what, what, oh!  Turn on your hot light.  Let it shine.  Wait a minute.  We could do a little radio thong idea. 
[01:55:00]  He's priceless, man.  I love the Dice Man.  Waiting for him to call back.  Rick, go call him.  Usually he calls right back.  Oh, here he is.  I got you now.  Here he goes.  What happened?  Dice, what's wrong with your phone?  I don't know.  What happened?  I don't know what happened.  What happened over there?  You on a cell phone?  With who?  Oh, you on a cell phone?  With who?  With us.  No, I'm talking, I'm talking to me now.  I know, but you're in the middle of the na-na thing. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, man, we'll get Bob Hope.  Bob Hope?  Yeah.  You seen him lately?  He looks like Mr. Freeze from the back.  He's been dead and back a thousand times, this guy.  Yeah.  He could do a few minutes for us.  Entertain the troops?  You know what I mean?  Well, people are digging the idea.  No, it's a, yeah, but they're going to think it's a, it's a goof.  The only way.  Because of the way you're treating it.  The only way it'll work, though, is if we get celebrities.  Have you listened to our...  We're going to get points.  You want me to call my agent right now while we're on the phone?  I know.  Yeah, because he'll tell you the lineup.  All right. 
[01:56:00]  One, give us the lineup.  Mary, Mary, Quacken, Trader.  Muslim women are so damn hairy.  Oh!  Anthony.  Yeah.  I'm trying to set this up.  Guys, it's an homage.  Be a human being.  I'm giving you an homage.  Be a human being a minute.  I can't even do my stupid jokes on your stupid show because everything gets dumped.  You've been doing some great jokes on our show.  No, what, the kink joke?  Right.  You think that's really appropriate now that we all have to pull together as Americans? 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, that's not good.  I don't think...  The nation's very sensitive right now.  You should steer away from it.  Yeah, but that's our job.  We need to make them laugh.  Let's leave the...  We need to raise money.  We need to make them laugh.  Let's leave the midgets away.  Yeah, I'll do like a clean, dirty joke.  All right.  Okay?  All right.  All right.  Well, can you say pussy on the air?  Only if it's a cat.  All right.  So we're talking about a cat.  So just...  I'm trying to poke my eye, huh?  I don't know about that. 
[01:57:00]  And that's about a cat?  Yeah, right.  No, they didn't buy that down the hall.  I understand that.  What do you mean they didn't buy it down the hall?  Who's down the hall?  Who's taking bites out of their pet?  I mean...  You get it?  It's all about the content.  All right.  I got one.  All right.  I got it.  All right.  Why don't chickens wear underwear?  Is that good?  Is that a good one? 
[01:57:30]  No, that's not a good one.  Can you play that one?  No, you can't do that one either.  All right.  How do you keep a bagel from getting away?  How?  You put rocks on it.  Bop.  All right.  That's clean.  Yeah.  You ain't gonna win it, but it's clean.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What did one ocean say to the other ocean?  Nothing.  And they just waved.  I sleep.  What do you have when you have two green balls in your hand? 
[01:58:00]  What?  Kermit's undivided attention.  You see what I mean?  We gotta go back to the film.  You went too far.  You see what I mean?  It's gonna be all clean jokes like that.  Hold on.  Joe wants in about the radiothon.  Joe?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You two had a great idea about this radio telethon.  Thanks, man.  But Dice won't take this seriously.  I know.  What's wrong with you, Dice? 
[01:58:30]  What's wrong about me?  You're making jokes about this like it's some little thing.  It's my idea.  I heard ONA come up with it first.  What about you?  Who came up with it first?  Dice, we've been talking about this on the radio for the last three hours.  Because I told you about it.  And I told you don't talk about it till I come on.  I don't remember that.  You don't remember that?  We had a two and a half conversation last night over that thing there.  Ask our listeners.  Since three o'clock, we've been talking about a great idea we came up with called the radiothon.  They know it's my idea. 
[01:59:00]  They know you're not smart enough to come up with that.  All right.  You want to ask them?  No, I don't want...  No.  Don't start this.  All right.  I'll ask them.  Who am I asking?  Joe.  Yo.  How long have we been talking about the radiothon today?  I would guess since three o'clock.  Yeah.  That's my approximate guess.  They had to say it was my idea, right, Joe?  No, they said it was ONA's idea.  Where are you from, Joe?  It was lunchtime conversation.  Where are you from?  Jersey.  Well, you're not involved in the telethon, all right?  Hang up the phone. 
[01:59:30]  Why not?  Because I said so.  Wait.  We're going to need all the help.  All right, Joe.  I'm sorry.  Why do you hate Jersey?  Hang up.  I love Jersey.  I just don't like you for saying they didn't say me.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  All right, Joe.  Anthony, don't start with you.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  That's great for my mind.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  I'm not going to argue with me.  I'm not going to argue with me today.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  No, you don't...  You see, I'm not going to do that.  Hang the phone up, you skank. 
[02:00:00]  Stop it.  Don't talk to me like that.  I'm over here now.  Excuse me.  I'm over here now.  Hey, I'm over here now because you said I'm over here now.  Oh, excuse me.  I didn't know you were everybody.  Boogaloo.  Boogaloo.  Boogaloo.  Boogaloo.  Boogaloo.  Boogaloo.  Boogaloo.  Boogaloo.  Look what I did to you.  Again.  Yeah, well, maybe I'll do it to you this time, big shot.  Nice.  Be nice. 
[02:00:30]  Nice.  Don't tell me to be nice.  Why?  I came in here with my lady.  You open your mouth and I do this to you and everybody goes ahead and then you hear this.  Oh.  I like the tape dice.  I like the dice on tape.  You like the dice on tape?  Yeah.  I don't even understand the way I talk.  Ha, ha, ha, na, na.  Now they don't know if it's me or the tape.  You got so much stuff on me, you could just piece together conversations.  Yeah.  Look what I did to you again. 
[02:01:00]  Wait, let me do it with it.  Tell me when.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  Here I am.  Ready?  Hang the phone up, you gang.  No, not that one.  Which one?  The other thing.  The other thing for you said what?  About who?  In now.  You missed it, see?  No.  Can we get back to the end now?  You know, everybody's going to think this is a goof.  It's not going to be set up. 
[02:01:30]  You know what?  And now that we've talked about it, somebody else is going to do it and you're going to  look like idiots.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  Stop it now.  All right.  Vito.  Let's meet people.  Jerry Tice Lewis.  These guys have been talking about it last Tuesday while you were buried in a hole back  in Hollywood.  What are you talking about?  This is my whole idea.  Nice.  Nice.  Does it really matter who came up with the idea?  Yeah.  What, do you want credit for it after all this? 
[02:02:00]  No.  I just want to get it done.  Obviously, you're the one that wants credit because you keep going, we're talking about  63 o'clock.  Ah, nah, nah.  Are you going to be wearing a tuxedo?  No.  Why not?  This is a rock and roll telethon.  Oh, rock and roll telethon.  Yeah.  What about the dong?  This is the brawl for it all.  Oh, yeah?  That's right.  All right.  We're going to get some heavy hitters on that.  Who are we getting? 
[02:02:30]  I told you.  You want me to call my guy?  Now, give me some names off the top of your head.  Yeah, we don't know anyone.  Yes, you do.  You've got a lot of people.  No.  We'll get an impressionist that does a thousand people.  Don't worry about who we're going to get.  We're going to do this.  Now, when can we do it?  Haven't you been listening to our show for the last three years?  We've never had anyone famous on this show.  It's Dice Stock.  Don't take the brown acid.  Oh.  Hey, I like Dice Stock. 
[02:03:00]  No, but we can't give me all the credit.  I'm just the brains behind you.  Well, we don't want to give you any.  No, I know.  I know how you are.  All right.  Believe me, I know you.  All right.  I know you better than you know you.  All right.  Believe me, you don't even know who you are.  All right.  Who are we going to be wearing?  Are you wearing a beige shirt today, my friend?  No beige today.  No beige.  What are you wearing?  Green.  Green.  You make no statement.  Don't have to.  Yes, you do.  Beige makes no statement.  The joke don't work unless someone's wearing beige.  No, no.  It's green.  It's beige.  It's gray.  It don't matter what it is. 
[02:03:30]  I'm wearing a...  It's every color other than black.  Black is the only color.  I'm wearing a Gap green t-shirt.  Gap.  Just the fact you brought it in Gap says what your life is about.  You can't wear Everlast sweatshirts all the time, Don.  Yes, you can, my friend.  All right.  We got to take a break.  Break from what?  From this.  Well, what are we going to do?  Are we going to do this?  We need people.  We're going to get people.  We're going to look stupid.  We have a telethon, a radio telethon, and we don't have anybody. 
[02:04:00]  I grew up with my heart in the right place and this idea in the right place.  I got a gaffer from Fort Fairland.  And Anthony keeps doing me.  It's like I don't even want to do me anymore because this idiot just does me.  You don't want to do yourself anymore?  No, I'm not doing me no more.  All right.  I'm going to be Chris Walken from now on.  All right, Dice, if you're so serious about the radiothon, have one of your big, big  celebrity friends call us just so we have some confidence in your abilities to get these 
[02:04:30]  people aboard.  Oh, you want a big celebrity?  What?  I could get the little redhead kid from different strokes.  I was on that show.  All right, so you don't want to do this?  We need to know who's going to be involved.  Right.  How many times have I said we called a guy right now?  Are you going to call some of your M.A.S.H.  friends?  You want me to call the guy right now?  Dice is in M.A.S., you know.  You want me to call the guy right now?  He's an injured soldier.  Can we count on?  I don't know what he means.  I've got to get his personality. 
[02:05:00]  What's wrong with you?  Can we count on Alan Alda?  We're going to get everybody.  I think everybody will want to be part of this.  All right.  Because this isn't a network nonsense show.  You have our hotline.  Get one guy to call us.  This is an immediate thing.  Get one big celebrity to call us.  I got him right here.  John Travolta.  I got John Travolta.  John, come here.  Just have a look.  Yeah, we're going to do the talk.  All right, get out of here, stupid.  What the hell?  John Travolta is going to be on with us.  Do you hear him over there?  No. 
[02:05:30]  I'm on the phone.  I want to get out of here.  I'll give you a crack in the head.  Hey, is Stallone there?  Everybody's here.  Sly, Sly, fix your lip.  Come here.  Say something.  You know, I think we all got to get together.  Shut up, stupid.  That's pretty good, man.  Do something from Rocky.  Whoever I do is perfect.  Do something from Rocky.  Something from Rocky.  What was that like?  The movie?  Yeah.  As John Travolta.  No.  I can't beat him. 
[02:06:00]  All right, we didn't ask you to do it all day.  No, you said, sir, it's Travolta.  Oh, I was?  Yeah.  All right.  You said beat Travolta in Rocky.  Do walk-in.  I can't do them.  You did a good walk-in.  All right.  Are there any girls in there?  Are there any girls in there?  Yes.  Then let me in.  Do you have pecan ice cream?  Yes.  You have to say yeah when I say something. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  You say yeah.  No, wait, wait till I ask you for something.  Okay.  All right.  Do you have pecan ice cream?  Yeah.  Then let me have some.  Do you see what I mean?  How I do that?  And people are going to listen to this for 24 straight hours.  See, Jay Moore thinks he does the walk-in.  I do.  He does Dean Martin.  What?  He does a great Dean Martin.  How about Eric Roberts?  Love the Eric Roberts.  What's the matter?  You don't want to. 
[02:07:00]  Wait, wait.  I don't think you can say that.  Hold on.  That was too good.  And they dumped out of that, my friend.  Why'd they dump out?  Because you're describing something in the Das Dimpier.  Yeah.  Do the Charlie, they took my thumb line.  Oh, you want something from that?  Well, you got to explain what you want.  Eric Roberts from the Pope from Greenwich Village.  There you go.  Eric Roberts.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  You can't say the effing part. 
[02:07:30]  You can't say the effing part.  Then I got to make something up fresh.  Just say effing.  Let me tell you.  I got to think of something he would do like.  Just do the line.  Which one?  Tell me the line and I'll say it again.  Charlie, they took my effing thumb.  Everyone.  You know.  Hold on.  I know what you meant.  You can't say the eff word.  I know what you meant now.  You meant like.  Say effing.  Like say. 
[02:08:00]  Like.  Fungu or something.  Just don't say it at all.  I'll just say they took my thumb.  No, no.  I got something.  Leave it out.  You know something, Charlie?  Sometimes you got to whack them, you know?  You say you put your coat on and you don't say go night to nobody.  And that's just to humble them, Charlie.  Good Eric Roberts. 
[02:08:30]  No, but see the bit I'm working on, they're all part of a vagina now.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Like all the impressions are part of Sarah Jessica's vagina.  You're doing the vagina monologues?  The vagina monologues.  You know?  I got to go out, but he was the other thing I talked about.  Right.  Don't say it.  You know what I mean?  Don't say it.  I'm not saying it.  You're the one that pushed me into it.  Welcome.  I didn't want to get involved in that conversation.  Welcome to the Andrew Dice Clay telethon with stars Lonnie Anderson, Mr. T, Andrea McArdle. 
[02:09:00]  Let me ask you this.  Tommy Mac.  That's funny.  Andrea McArdle.  Let's not forget Charro.  And Charro.  The coochie coochie girl.  Can we count on Charro for the radiothon?  Can't you guys get anybody?  You got to help out, too.  We don't have any celebrities on the show.  With Jamie Farr and J.P. Morgan.  You got a lot of celebrities that'll do this thing.  You got that one guy.  You know that one guy. 
[02:09:30]  Can we count on Radar from your match stage?  Radar O'Reilly?  Could you get him?  What's he doing these days?  I don't know.  You know what?  The way you guys are acting on the air, you won't be doing nothing tomorrow.  What are you talking about?  The people are going to get very mad at you.  This is not a joke.  Oh, stop it.  Just have one of these big celebrities call us.  No, we'll set up the whole thing.  I'm not having no big...  I just had a few guys on with you.  Who?  You know who you were talking to, like?  So people are going to donate money for 24 hours straight radio of you doing impressions. 
[02:10:00]  We should donate money anyway.  No matter who's on.  We'll be on.  We're going to have a lot of laughs.  You're going to sing some Elvis.  Radar O'Reilly.  Are you going to dress up like Elvis?  Yes.  You'll do whatever it takes, right?  Yeah.  It'll be like a pre-Christmas thing.  That's a true American.  You know what I mean?  All right.  Yeah.  I wouldn't...  No, you can't.  Can you use that?  No.  You know what?  For that day, they're going to have to give us a waiver on language also. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, dice.  You can't say you have to stop.  See, it's not a place for the dirty language.  This is something we should really do and do it the right way.  Without goofing around.  All right.  You know what I mean?  And now I'm bringing on a big star.  The cameraman from Casual Sex.  Anthony, I'll give you an address in Brooklyn.  Don't make me give you an address in Brooklyn.  I moved, dice.  I know where you moved. 
[02:11:00]  That's why I have the address.  Ah-na-na.  Ah-na-na-na.  Ah-na-na.  Ah-na-na-na.  Ah-na-na.  Ah-na-na.  Chris is saying this is his best idea since Brain Smasher.  I liked Brain Smasher.  Yeah.  Who cares if you don't?  All right.  Let's...  Like, I think about these things.  All right, dice.  We really got to go.  I don't care if you got to go.  What are we doing?  We got to go.  All right.  So what do we do now?  Got to work out the details.  Call your guy.  See who you can get. 
[02:11:30]  You want me to call him right now?  Yeah, call him.  Yeah, after you hang up with us.  No, no.  I could get him in one second.  Ah-na-na.  There you go.  Now we say goodbye to you.  Here goes dice.  Holy crap.  All right.  We have to take a break.  You actually have a great relationship with dice.  I like the dice, man.  Nah-na-na.  How much fun dueling dice?  I love it.  It's fun.  Dueling dice.  Right?  All right.  We got to take a little bit of a break, huh?  All right.  Yeah.  I've been broke in about an hour. 
[02:12:00]  We'll be back.  Opie.  I'm the dick.  Anthony.  I'm an ass.  I don't want to turn you on.  This is the Opie.  That has a new show.  Why are you wasting your time with this sleazy trash?  People are starting to say funniest radio ever, so don't wreck it.  Anthony, O2Go.  O2Go.  Water that's, what, oxygenated and has lots of oxygen and stuff, right?  Right.  It's very good.  Same water, more oxygen. 
[02:12:30]  More oxygen.  It's distilled water, which has been proven to be healthier in some lab somewhere.  I don't know.  They say distilled water is much better for you.  But the taste of distilled water, there's the problem.  But then, the people at O2Go realize, you put some oxygen in it.  You oxygenate the water.  And it tastes great.  And it gives you some energy.  Helps you think better.  Because it's got oxygen in it. 
[02:13:00]  O2Go.  Yeah.  Pure water.  Crisp, refreshing.  Stay healthy.  And get the oxygen you need.  What a great gas oxygen is.  O2Go.  Pick it up where you get bottled water.  O2Go.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Got to get to Joe really fast here.  Joe, what's going on?  Dad set the show back on track for a while. 
[02:13:30]  What's up?  The call.  The Dice call.  Yeah.  We're back on track now.  We're getting the chuckles.  We like Dice's radio thong idea.  The thong.  We know we're going to do something really huge.  We just don't know what yet.  And, you know, we've got to figure it out.  Yeah.  It's cool, Dad.  All right.  Later.  Thanks, Joe.  Joe.  Dice trying, though, Ann, right?  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  You can do it. 
[02:14:00]  You can do it.  Let's go to Kenny.  Kenny, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, you're inside Brill's content on the Internet.  What?  You guys were reviewed.  You were, let me see here.  Just a second.  Let me just pull it up.  We're on, we're...  Yeah.  With America already in shock, radio jocks pulled back.  Last week's terrorist attack were no laughing matter for the drive-time  personalities whose bad taste has no boundaries by Jesse Oxfeld. 
[02:14:30]  And it has a whole report, but it's a paying subscription.  So you guys wouldn't be able to see it.  You want me to email it to you?  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  Give me the address.  All right.  Hold on.  Wait.  There's one more thing.  What?  Bill Clinton was down at Ground Zero today.  Oh, yeah?  Again.  He was just there Monday.  What's he doing there?  He's concerned.  He's concerned?  Yeah.  He's from New York now.  He's in New York now.  But what's he giving?  Moral support?  Probably. 
[02:15:00]  But he's an immoral guy, isn't he?  He's giving immoral support.  That's great.  Come here, baby.  I know you're hurt.  Let me hug you.  Come here.  Yeah, it's terrible.  But you'd be surprised how many guys pull out cameras and they're interested in getting  his picture and everything.  Let's say now, baby, that your mouth is bin Laden.  And this here's a missile.  Here's what the United States is going to do.  You know what it is, though?  Hillary Clinton has been such a beacon of strength and inspiration. 
[02:15:30]  Chelsea was there, too.  Chelsea was there?  Yeah.  Cool.  All right, Kenny.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Bye.  Later.  All right.  Chelsea's got the kind of hair that, you know, just takes a week to wash a batch out of.  Right?  Right?  Too much DNA evidence.  I can't, my brother.  I'm surprised Dice hasn't called back.  I hope he's not pissed at us.  No, he's fine.  Yeah.  That's the first time anyone outside New York has heard us talking to Dice. 
[02:16:00]  Did you see Hillary getting all pissed?  Bill, you're getting much too much camera time.  I'm down there with Chuck Schumer every day.  Yeah, what is Chuck?  And the camera's on you.  What is Chuck doing down there?  Chuck Schumer has his face buried in Hillary's fat booty is what that's all about.  You know who we haven't seen is the Reverend Kidd.  Al Sharpton.  You haven't seen him, huh?  Yeah, he's got a...  I can only say, you know something?  He went to lay low.  Maybe, you know something?  I would definitely respect the guy if he just decided, look, I ain't getting involved in this one. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, Tom from Bayshore says it all in this instant feedback.  Question, where's Fat Al during all of this?  After years of wrongfully slamming the NYPD and the fire department, do you think that fat bastard would finally show some class  and at least have the guts to acknowledge the incredible job these people do day in and day out?  You know something?  There's an angle I didn't even look at.  There you go.  Now I could go back to hating him again.  I was going to say, at least he knew not to come out and try to spew any rhetoric and get a cause in or something when all this is going on. 
[02:17:00]  But the fact that he hasn't come out and praised the NYPD for what they've done and the city and Giuliani and everything, it, yeah.  Maybe sometimes saying nothing is, you know, just as good as saying something.  Why couldn't he just come out as a New Yorker and say something like a person and just, you know, do something helpful?  Everyone else has.  Yeah.  I'm getting together a telethon.  Wait a minute.  That was my idea. 
[02:17:30]  Chuck Schumer and Justin from D.C. has something.  Justin.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  New listener out here in D.C.  And I don't know about the rest of your new markets, but probably unlike you guys, everyone thought Dice was dead.  I didn't know he was still alive.  Oh, stop.  He's alive and well, and he's a good friend of the show.  I'm alive and kicking, you wish.  Hey, well, hey, uh.  Hey, Jerko, thanks.  That's the downside of you guys, I guess.  There's got to be something to everybody.  All right, Justin.  Thank you.  We got the tribute songs. 
[02:18:00]  You want to finally play a few of these?  Ugh.  Oh, these?  Just another way people are trying to capitalize on what happened to us.  I just wish somebody would call him with a poem.  Yeah.  You know, last week we.  Listen, they stink.  I heard them on another station last night, and I wanted to just punch this guy in the face.  Nothing worse than a melodramatic poem with a Camden accent.  Stop calling in to radio shows and reading poetry.  No.  You're absolutely right. 
[02:18:30]  You know something?  For some reason, people feel that when there's a tragedy, all of a sudden they become poets,  songwriters, and the truth of the matter is, you're not.  We gave people a lot of liberty last week because they needed it, you know.  They needed an outlet, and we were here.  But some of those, a couple of them were pretty good, you know, kind of had the whole essence of the whole thing.  But Dice's poetry is more poignant, if I may use the word again, poignant, than some of the stuff we were hearing. 
[02:19:00]  Where are the tribute songs?  Is it in three?  Or is it...  Tribute.  Now, are these original tribute songs?  Yeah.  Oh, sent in by various bands or people that...  They're not even our listeners.  They're just sending these songs to every station.  To every station, hoping that through this tragedy, they can get some air time.  Wow, we never knew how deep you were until we heard that.  Yeah.  Stupid asses. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  All right, well, here's the first one, okay?  We don't even know who it's by or...  Oh, we don't?  Yeah, don't even mention any.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  Today, our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under attack.  Yeah.  767 hit the World Trade Center at 8.48 this morning.  And 16 minutes later, United Flight 175 delivered the second floor.  Flight 77 took aim on the Pentagon.  It crashed in a fireball at 9.38.  At 10.20, two and a half hours after the four-pronged attack was lost, the plane crashed in a rural Pennsylvania field. 
[02:20:00]  Terrible sadness.  Seagull, you fly across the right into the misty morning sun.  These acts of mass murder were intended to frighten our nation into chaos and retreat.  We ask you where you are closing in.  Nobody knows where you're from. 
[02:20:30]  But they have failed.  Uh-huh.  Our country is strong.  Here is a man asking a question.  Is this really the end of the world?  When you feel safe here and now, you don't feel as safe.  Seagull, you must have known for a long time the shape of things to come.  Now you fly through the sky, never asking why. 
[02:21:00]  And you fly or run to somebody, shoot you down.  Not only will there be mourning for the death, there will be many, many questions.  All right.  And the impact of death.  Thank you.  And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon.  You didn't recognize who that was?  That's Gordon Lightfoot. 
[02:21:30]  Is that Gordon Lightfoot?  Clap.  We all started running.  The Corbin Park.  The Rick of the Edmund Fitzgerald.  Yeah.  Across the horizon.  Into the misty morning sun.  Either that or like the last song on Bad Company, Bad Company.  Bad Company.  No one, did you hear that?  The Rick of the Edmund Fitzgerald.  Seagull, fly high.  All right, well.  I just hate the news clip put in to accentuate the point. 
[02:22:00]  That's enough.  Nice try.  Nice try to that guy.  He's great.  You know, he's trying to do something, I guess.  Okay.  Great use of a 1979 Echoplex.  I like that effect.  All right, ready for another one here?  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Goodbye, England's rose. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, this is a little R&B, right?  Doesn't it kick in?  That's right.  I heard that one.  Yeah.  Yeah, check this out.  R&B for really bad. 
[02:23:00]  No love for anyone who's different.  Please, can we all just get along?  Oh, my God.  Is it still the same old song?  Yeah.  When we stop hurting each other, we'll see.  Can we all just get along?  Can we all just get along?  Oh, it's the same old song.  When will we love each other? 
[02:23:30]  We've been taking, hearts are aching for a revolution.  Tears are falling, the people are coming, the people are coming for a revolution.  What the hell was that?  Okay.  All right.  Well, thank you.  Thanks for sending that in. 
[02:24:00]  Thank you.  Can we follow that up with two sir with love?  Thank you, Lulu.  Two sir with love.  Let's go to Jim.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, I was rather here, evil Barney, than that crap.  Don't ever do that again, guys.  All right, Jim.  Thank you.  Isn't this stuff great?  We got lots of them.  Come on.  This stuff's great.  It's inspiring.  We got five of them today alone.  All right.  Here's the third one.  John Cougar Mellencamp. 
[02:24:30]  John Cougar Mellencamp.  I was born in America, where freedom still prevails.  I believe that fellow man should help when freedom fails.  We're not a mouse.  Yeah.  We're not a mouse. 
[02:25:00]  I don't need no attitude.  I don't want to believe we're not a mouse.  Is this the knack?  Yeah, yeah.  I think it's the knack.  I think it's the knack.  Oh.  I think it's a fun and roll. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, boy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  We're low and go.  Oh.  The fast times at Ridgemont High Memorial.  Sounds like XTC.  A little XTC, right?  Makes me want to hear some Pat Benatar.  Yeah.  Here's a rule of thumb.  Anytime a song starts with, I was born in America, 
[02:26:00]  it will stink.  Joni, what's up?  You have to stop it right now.  It's awful and nobody's enjoying it.  They're horrible songs.  I know.  Shut it off.  These people, they mean well, but I don't know.  The music was too loud, first of all.  How loud are you guys?  All right, let's try the fourth one.  Five of these came in today alone. 
[02:26:30]  Uh-oh.  James Taylor.  Dream all you feel.  You can.  This is Peter Paul and suck.  Yeah.  Simon and you are fine.  You feel all you feel.  You can.  Don't you think it's time to make a change?  Yes, yes, rock! 
[02:27:00]  Don't you think it's time to rearrange?  Now, that one's kind of surprising.  Don't you think it's time to take a stand?  I'm walking along that road, and it just don't seem to be that road, I know. 
[02:27:30]  Let's put the conch in country.  Well, that was funny.  I see a nation with devastation, see the world out.  Uh, the doggies.  The red engine here.  All right, thank you, Billy Ray Cyrus.  Thank you.  The change in rearrange, though, was nice.  Ah, from the Brady Bunch.  He puts the suck in stink.  Or something.  Wow.  Goddamn.  Okay.  Maybe this should be filed away, Opie. 
[02:28:00]  We're loud and gone!  That's my favorite so far.  Yeah, this is why they have armed guards outside of record companies.  To keep these people out.  I like the Gordon Lightfoot myself.  That was good.  You like that one?  The Rick of the Edmund Fitzgerald.  All right, here's our last one for today.  Yep.  Even John Valby sent us one.  Where's the John Valby one?  These are worse than the songs Dirk Diggler recorded in Wookiee Nights.  Goddamn Joe from Jersey.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  That was great.  We got two to go, Anthony, because we got John Valby. 
[02:28:30]  He did a song, too, okay?  Did he?  Yeah, here's another one by someone else.  Alice in Chains.  Sounds like he's singing into a fan. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, okay, I'm going out to get some nachos. 
[02:29:30]  Sounds like something off one of the Kiss solo LPs.  Hey, I bought all four of them.  Ace Frehley sucked.  Aces.  At least Aces had Beth.  Back in the New York group.  No, that was Peter Criss.  That was Peter Criss.  Back in the New York group.  I know.  That was a great song by Ace Frehley.  Yeah, but Ace Frehley sold the most out of all four of those. 
[02:30:00]  Gene Simmons was the worst.  Simmons was the worst.  All right, Ben's telling us we have to take a break, so we'll do it.  We got John Valby's song.  Damn it.  Trust me, this isn't a radio tease.  It's not that great.  Look at this.  It makes...  These guys make Starland vocal bands sound talented.  Afternoon.  Peter Paul and Fairy.  I'm about to jab a pen through my ears into my brain.  Well, the reviews are in.  Hey, finally, a Loverboy reunion.  John Cougar Mellon crap. 
[02:30:30]  That Dirk Diggler line was hilarious.  Dirk Diggler.  These songs are coming in every day, too.  It's...  Wow.  I don't think you save it.  I wonder if they listen to the song before they send it in.  They can't be sitting around their basement going, hey, this is great.  Yeah.  Not enough in-the-sky references.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, that's wrong, baby!  Woo!  Woo!  Yeah, sure. 
[02:31:00]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's left to do today, Ant?  I don't know.  We got John Valby's song about the tragedy.  Oh, yeah.  And we can play a quick round of what did we learn.  How's the John Valby song?  I haven't heard it yet.  Want to check it out?  Someone is really pissed off at us, though.  For what? 
[02:31:30]  Now, hold on.  Let's go to Ken.  Let's then find out.  Ken, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to say, you know, I mean, these artists, their songs might not be that  good, all right?  But that's the way they express, the way they feel about their country, and that's okay.  I think we said that.  Because you guys, you know, you have, you know, you have radio.  That's your way to express the way you feel.  These guys, you know, they write a song, they send it in, if it gets played, and you take  it for what it's worth, it's a great song.  They're trying to capitalize on the national... 
[02:32:00]  Wow, and they're not making money, though.  Yeah, all dirty.  We don't know that for sure.  And, Ken, we did say that, you know, this is people expressing themselves, but we got  to goof on it a little bit.  I mean, the one sounded like...  Yeah, I know.  It's funny.  The other one sounded like...  Poison, every rose has a thorn.  The Yankees and the Mets of the World Series.  It's our country, and our Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine going in to fight for us.  It's just something to inspire.  All right, Ken, slow down.  We understand the seriousness of this, and you're talking about the seriousness of our 
[02:32:30]  men and women going overseas with goofy tribute songs that stink.  Yeah, I know they stink, but they mean something to them.  And if they throw them out just to have a song, I mean, that's their way of expressing  themselves, and you've got to take it just for that.  All right.  They should play them in their houses where only they are subjected to them.  And another thing, any song that begins, you know, I was born in the USA does not suck.  And that's really stupid for you to say.  No, it's not.  It's not talking about Springsteen.  It's just normally going to be a melodramatic song. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, but normally, this isn't a normal time.  We understand that, Ken.  Everyone understands it.  I mean, I'm just a little, you know, upset.  All right, all right.  Take it easy.  My father's military.  I'm patriotic.  I know.  Your father's great.  Point well taken.  Thank you, Ken.  All right.  Bye, guys.  All right.  With that said, here's John Valby's song.  Today, I'm going to attack 9-11-2001, and as they cheer in the streets of Palestine, they 
[02:33:30]  cry in the streets of New York.  But today, we stand as Americans, still proud, angry, but we will not give in. 
[02:34:00]  We will not kill innocent people for our revenge.  Ah, collateral damage.  For America, we really believe in freedom and justice.  And justice is what's coming to you, Osama.  First name bass.  All you Islam and jihad.  Games on. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, disco people are going to get you.  Well, you can run all day, hide all night.  Osama bin Laden, now we're ready to fight.  Going to get you.  Going to get you.  Oh, yeah.  Valby around.  The bitches got to get you.  When New York smoked, the Pentagon burned. 
[02:35:00]  Osama bin Laden, now it's your turn.  Going to get you.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Going to get you.  The innocent died because you're hating.  Osama bin Laden, you're the real Satan.  Oh, hate Satan.  The towers came down on the street today.  How much longer is this?  The freedom still stands in the USA.  The towers came down on the street today. 
[02:35:30]  The freedom still stands in the USA.  Um, all right.  I wonder if Ken still feels the same way he did a few minutes ago when he called.  I was, uh, I was hoping for more of a, uh, filthy.  I know a guy.  His name's bin Laden.  Bin Laden, bin Laden, bin Laden.  Bend him over.  I'll slip a rod in.  You know, something more, uh.  More Valby-ish.  More Valby-like.  Sure.  Ah.  Ah. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, I can do a little Valby.  Look at that.  Ah, drink people.  Ah.  Ah, drink people.  Time to drink.  Hope you're doing an impression.  That's a drinking game.  You gotta drink.  That's all I can do from Valby, but.  Ah.  That was pretty good rap, though.  Oof.  Think?  With a little techno.  Rule of thumb, white man with buffalo accents, never rap.  That reminds me when, uh, you know, rap got so popular, McDonald's decided they have  to do a little rap commercial. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, remember that?  No.  Yeah, like, uh, after hip-hop became pretty acceptable, everyone was doing it in their  commercial.  He also had, uh, you gotta help me, that Jesus Christ superstar thing happening in the middle  of the rap, that, there was a song out in the 70s, Help Me Somebody.  Hmm.  Song out in the 70s.  Wow.  Now you.  Someone will come up with it.  There's all about.  Ah.  What?  What?  You're just laughing over there?  All right, let's play What Did We Learn on the ONA Show today. 
[02:37:00]  Ernie from Jersey.  Today I learned that rain doesn't hit satellites because they're in space.  Who needs schools when you have jails?  Starker Patty will work at Mickey D's today, Godiva tomorrow.  Mickey D's on Friday and both on Saturday.  Care.  And God says 10%.  West Coast Dave, today I learned that when Norton's not in the studio, he's out examining  female urine samples.  Uh, Tuna from Queens said, is it just me or did Dr. Dirty go from a classic piano to a 
[02:37:30]  1987 Casio keyboard?  Let's go to, uh, Caroline.  Caroline.  How come that's the Balby song that doesn't get dumped out of it?  Oh, God damn.  You guys are brutal, man.  They're just expressing themselves.  These are artists expressing themselves.  I don't know.  It sounded like John Balby was doing like a Mark Harris impression.  I don't know what was going on when they heard that song.  Oh, we're going to catch you.  There was one of those songs.  Oh, man.  I will get it.  It's the pictures that are catches.  It was a pop song in the 70s that had all that stuff going on. 
[02:38:00]  And it was from Jesus Christ Superstar, the musical, or no?  No, I was just some stupid man who, ah.  Oh, okay.  Well, um, I learned that dueling dice is always funny.  Yes.  And I also wanted to say that I was not responsible for that call earlier that you thought maybe  was me.  That Caroline.  Oh, okay.  Well, I didn't want to be charged with a bad call.  Caroline, not the one we have on the phone right now.  All right, Caroline.  Bye.  Bye. 
[02:38:30]  Brett writes, today I learned any song that starts with I was born in America stinks.  Norton rules.  Chris writes, today I learned that Muslim women are known as bang puppets.  I can't say the F word.  Jerry writes, today's What Did We Learn is brought to you by Starker Patty's French Fried Godiva  Sticks.  Bring some home for the queen of your hill.  Very funny.  Got to thank Jerry for the chuckle.  Yeah.  Just going for a few chuckles.  You want a chuckle?  Today I learned if you own a tropical island, don't leave Anthony in charge. 
[02:39:00]  Yes.  Never use a million dollar missile to blow up a ten dollar tent.  The U.S. has stick-seeking missiles.  I like that song, yo.  Sounds important.  Let's go to Doug.  Hey, Doug.  Doug?  Ah.  Doug?  He's listening to himself.  Sometimes it'd be funny, I'll say, Earth to Doug.  That's a chuckle? 
[02:39:30]  Calm down, boo.  John Paul, what's up?  How you doing?  All right.  Hey, I'm the program director, the affiliate in Buffalo, and I got to tell you, the last  song you guys just played, Total Hit.  John Valby?  Yeah, Total Hit.  It's a hit.  I had my radio cranked up on my car.  We love the John Valby, but he's a good friend of the show.  It was so good.  Yeah. 
[02:40:00]  All right.  How are things going in Buffalo so far?  Going all right.  Yeah?  Going all right.  It's been busy, but I'm loving these songs you're playing, because I'm getting a bunch  of them mailed to me, too, and most of them all suck.  Except for the last one you just played, which is great.  John Paul, send them in.  We'll give you credit.  We'll say the PD in Buffalo is getting these.  We'll play them.  Well, the sad thing is I just threw out a bunch of them today.  I'll have to go take them out of my garbage.  I encourage all those cities to send in the bad songs.  We'll play them.  All right.  All right, John Paul.  Thank you.  See you.  Bye. 
[02:40:30]  Bin Laden.  Bin Laden who?  Bin Laden in and out and in and out of that dumper when we flipped her over at the gangbang.  Oh!  That's more like what I was expecting.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Continue drinking.  Ah.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Osama.  Osama who?  Osama at the gangbang.  Ah. 
[02:41:00]  Ah.  Ah.  That's quite a fine ah.  Yeah, it is.  That's the Valby ah.  Oh, yeah.  If you've ever seen Valby, man, people are digging it out there.  Ah.  All right.  Where else do we go?  Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  We did all that.  Bah, bah.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe, what did you learn today?  I learned how to make a bagel stay.  Mmm.  Ah.  Ah.  There we go. 
[02:41:30]  Let's go to Brian.  Brian, what's up?  What's up, Owen?  Today I learned that Andrew Dice Clay still has his American flag studded leather jacket.  Yeah.  I sent away for the bedazzler.  I learned one other thing, guys.  Remember the bedazzler?  You put the studs on your clothes right at home.  Guys, one more thing.  Paper or plastic?  Plastic.  Which way? 
[02:42:00]  Knock, knock.  No, you got to say knock, knock if you got one.  I don't have one for that one.  I don't have one for that either.  I know.  Well, we might.  We might before we get out of here.  All right.  I guess we're pretty much done for today.  Yeah.  Bubba?  Yeah.  What's up?  Yo.  Today I learned that Dice is a serious side and nobody gives an X.  Later, guys.  All right. 
[02:42:30]  Wow.  Ikea boy.  I learned Valby should never cover the safety dance.  That was on that one.  Beep, boop, beep.  Safety dance.  Well, the safety dance.  Hello.  Valby's song sounds like really bad Depeche Mode.  Ah.  I learned that music should be left to the professionals.  And they, and that's about it, I guess.  Matt learned that the American military probably has stick-seeking missiles. 
[02:43:00]  Valby's song sounded like Rock Me Amadeus by Falco.  Falco.  Remember Falco, yo?  Falco, Rock Me Amadeus.  All right.  Falco.  Well, we're outie.  Dunsky.  Thanks, guys.  Outsky, opsky.  I hope we gave you a distraction.  Word out.  By the way, four hours have passed.  Nothing new.  We will break in with the serious stuff when it does happen.  And we're just going for a few chuckles.  I hope you had a chuckle today. 
[02:43:30]  All right?  What do they named?  A chuckle or two.  That's the new thing.  They named it.  Yeah, they did.  Operation Infinite Justice.  Infinite, it goes on forever.  Back at the League of Justice.  We need a superhero now, right?  Yeah.  Well.  Random.  There was a cartoon in the post today, or the Daily News, where the superheroes were lined up.  Post.  A post asking the fireman for an autograph.  That's a nice one.  That's pretty good.  I thought that was pretty cool.  Is that really what it's called?  Infinite.  Operation Infinite Justice.  Operation Infinite Justice. 
[02:44:00]  What channel is this?  That's the name of the operation.  It's everywhere.  Oh, it's everywhere.  That's the general term for...  Operation Bomb-A-Monkey would probably be...  All right.  We've got to get out of here.  All right, man.  Peace.  We'll see you tomorrow.  On a serious note, don't ever forget...  You know what we do here?  Absolutely nothing.  That's wonderful, isn't it?
