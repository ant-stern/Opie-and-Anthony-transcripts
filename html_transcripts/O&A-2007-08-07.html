<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics and segments, showcasing their signature blend of shock humor and listener interaction.  The show began with the hosts expressing frustration over their lawyers' restrictions on content, lamenting the over-cautious approach that prioritized avoiding legal trouble over maximizing ratings.  They discussed the limitations placed on several recurring segments, including "Hummer Tuesday" (with implied sexual content), and the cancellation of "Diabolical Laugh Tuesday" due to unsatisfactory listener submissions.  However, "Rock Scream Tuesday" and "Wake Up Your Spouse/Roommate/Significant Other Tuesday" were successful, with listeners submitting creative band name puns (like "Ungrateful Dead") and prank calls resulting in expletive-laden responses from unsuspecting sleeping partners, one involving brownies strategically placed between the caller's buttocks. A listener also performed a death metal-style scream on air.

The show interspersed these segments with discussions of unrelated news items, including a stripper performing CPR and a news clip of Vince McMahon.  There was also a discussion of the stock market, punctuated by a clip of Jim Cramer's on-air meltdown, and Sam's peculiar diet of children's food.  A Devin Retray voicemail was also mentioned.  A sarcastic commentary on a female television personality, comparing her unfavorably to Susan Waldman and Jim Cramer, further highlighted the hosts' irreverent style.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a heated exchange involving a listener, Brett, who argued with Marge, a PR person for the Little Shelter animal shelter on Long Island, about his experience trying to surrender a blind, abused kitten.  Brett’s brother, Opie’s brother Brett, detailed the shelter’s refusal to help, while Marge defended the shelter’s actions. This dispute was eventually resolved when another listener, Sarah, offered to adopt the kitten.  The segment concluded with further promotion of the North Shore Animal League.

The show also included a "Clean Up Day" segment featuring old audio clips from their WNEW days.  These clips included a bad breath advice segment with a dentist, listener remedies for bad breath, news clips (including one about Allen Iverson’s mother), segments featuring recurring characters Lady Dee and Marion, a call from their old producer, clips from their Bill O'Reilly interview, and a segment about an Austin Powers movie.  A significant portion focused on comedian Rich Voss, with the hosts playing extended clips from his older stand-up routines, highlighting humorous and awkward moments.  This was followed by a call from Jim Norton, who harshly criticized Voss's material.

Furthermore, the show featured a playback of more of Rich Voss's stand-up routine, with the hosts and Jim Norton's commentary interspersed. This was followed by several of Opie and Anthony's own past radio clips, featuring vulgar language, explicit sexual references, and offensive impersonations.  These clips highlighted the evolution of their on-air style and featured various recurring characters, including Buddy Epson, and included prank calls, a Frenchy argument with himself and a call with Ms. Cleo.  The hosts discussed near misses with disciplinary actions stemming from these past broadcasts. The show concluded with another clip of Buddy Epson’s singing.  No named guests were in the studio except for the various callers.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  it's the opie and anthony show opie and anthony radio shock jocks opie and anthony the biggest  are opie and anthony these people say shocking things that border on offensive uh in order to  entertain their options i refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice why why does radio  out of any other medium have to be nice we are being now held to a standard where we have to be  nice and make people feel good go screw radio bad boys opie and anthony controversial radio 
[00:00:30]  personalities opie and anthony infamous djs opie and anthony talk show radio host opie and anthony  opie and anthony opie and anthony radio shock jocks opie and anthony  if you want to put it feel free i've done it before i'll let you go from  to my that's really sick this is where entertainment is going more audio v-rock in the bathroom 
[00:01:00]  they got sick freaks can you pop this i want to see something squirt out aim it over there  this is the worst  this is the worst show i've ever been on but enough of this palaver let's get the show on the road 
[00:01:30]  enough flavor we got to get right into this tuesday is a really busy day on the opie and anthony show  why you might ask well why it's rock stream tuesday  very important day  oh my god yeah it's rock stream tuesday it's also hummer tuesday yes the lawyers uh stopped us dead in 
[00:02:00]  our tracks as far as homer tuesday go goes because they're not enjoying that day they really stop  that well they uh they hinted around it and i'm reading the message boards trust me we're trying to  get the gay out of the show but but our hands are tied behind our backs anything to do with a hot chick  they don't they don't want us to do does that mean like in prison we were just turned gay  like the second we're not able to get chicks look at where we go that's a really good where we go 
[00:02:30]  because you know uh some hardcore fans are looking at us a bit closely lately  and i'm telling you it's not our fault  what those dummies talk to the lawyers and try to explain this stuff yes what's the problem with  homework tuesday i forget it involves a man and a woman yeah men they'd probably love it oh  that's what we do to each other in the office we can promote it but we can't have too much  description about it we can't like the women calling and saying yeah i plan on you know blah blah 
[00:03:00]  blah or or last night uh i blah blah blah they don't like that so then what happens we go for  the easy stuff the gay stuff and then we look like idiots and you know it it really isn't graphic enough  to uh garner the uh attention of uh of the fcc they're so scared because that isn't one that's one  of those political correct things where you know a group's gonna come after you what the the whores of 
[00:03:30]  america right right now they're gonna come after you it's one of those things that uh you know  they're afraid that it's going to be a little too risque and all that's like titillating and it's  pandering and it's this and that and all the legal terminology they come up with all this crap that we  do but uh the truth of the matter is just a vague description of something like that is not going to  get an fcc violation i've read all of the lovely transcripts that come in that actually do get fcc 
[00:04:00]  violations say documents pretty yes we've read all the documents the documents and it's just  blatant like you know somebody really said something that was pretty graphic right some  somebody saying that uh you know they enjoyed hummer tuesday that's not going to do anything  just stop it lawyers don't want to do their job they want to do their jobs easy behind the scenes  they're not willing to go to court even if the fcc is wrong and do their jobs there that's why  they'd rather just sit there on their asses and just like complain in a boy room and not have to 
[00:04:30]  fight in court lawyers are lazy they don't want they're lazy they they they worked hard i guess  to get to be a lawyer you know with the school and everything that they have to go through but  then once they become lawyers they they like i was reading something on the message board about a  divorce somebody was getting a divorce and he was bitching about the fact that uh even though it was  an uncontested divorce that his lawyer wound up walking away with two grand uh for what a 250  dollar like uh uh the paralegal assistant one of his assistants did all the work but you got to slip 
[00:05:00]  him like two g's just because it's his name something and there's no choice you don't get a choice in  the matter you can't just walk in there yourself you know it's uh it's ridiculous they're just lazy  they'd rather just sit there and and and bitch about something and say no don't do that  than uh defend it well i mean that they don't get they don't get fired for bad ratings so they  don't give a crap so they'd rather say no to everything it's it's not their ass on the line 
[00:05:30]  i've been saying all along you know these uh companies like like like cbs  our big big bosses they should give a little responsibility to the lawyers like hey you need  to help our our number one radio show get the ratings up and if you don't you're fired as well  yeah and it would be a whole different ball game then we would be talking about hummer tuesday and  other things because then now the lawyers have something to lose and then they would sit around  washington figuring out how we can do a lot of things instead of just saying no no no no no no no 
[00:06:00]  no no because well you know when they fire us for bad ratings uh they continue with their jobs  with a brand new show they never lose their jobs for bad ratings never so why would you say yes to  anything yeah why would you because it's putting your neck on the line i see it that way you're  a lawyer down in washington you have nothing to lose you you can you continue getting paid no matter  what why would you say yes to anything we suggest yeah why you wouldn't there's nothing in it for them 
[00:06:30]  no incentive so i beg the big big bosses to like you know pull these lawyers aside and go look  here's the deal if you don't get their ratings up and help them get their ratings up and we feel  like you're hindering them you're fired too if you don't let them do some cool segments pronto then  you'll just be bogus too that's why the whole thing is ridiculous to me that they're never going to help  us out if there's any risk whatsoever that's why we just keep doing what we do so i mean the hummer  tuesday thing women you know uh we got a lot of fans out there and uh you know i guess the hummer thing 
[00:07:00]  it acknowledges that you you're a fan of the show maybe it kickstarts uh your the old relationship  that's all we're getting at look at that that's all we're getting at just kickstart the relationship  in honor of the opian anthony show all right can we say this hey women do what you're good for tuesdays  all right it's too early to talk about lawyers i'm sure people are hitting their snooze alarms all  over the place oh they're talking about lawyers so let's not yeah okay screw them it's also far 
[00:07:30]  away phone call tuesday never works out it's also diabolical laugh tuesday we might be losing that  one that's that one's uh faltering at least that one's doable at least people have done it yeah yeah  i don't know what the hell this whole uh uh uh far away phone call is people call up and they're not  far away hey we've uh had a far away phone call every week since we started this thing have we

I can't wait to hear it.  And there's just a few that think some of these bits are hacky.  We acknowledge they're hacky.  We're getting some good stuff out of this.  Some good radio out of it.  We just need those days of the week. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, absolutely.  Have events with them.  Yeah.  Like every hack radio show.  Yeah.  So we can be just like them.  Ours are just a little different, though, if you've noticed or not.  It's good fodder for the show.  Yeah.  Because, you know, by doing the hacky theme bits, you get stuff like this.  That's why we do these themes. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, is that awful?  Because you never know where it's going to go.  Rock Head Tuesday.  Rock Head.  I got to hear that again.  Of course, who came up with this?  This is really good.  Terry Shido getting involved with Rock Scream Tuesday.  This was followed by Pull the Plug Wednesday. 
[00:20:00]  Followed up by Was She Trying to Talk Thursdays?  And we can't second-gust ourselves Friday.  Oh, no.  She...  She...  She...  She...  She...  She...  She...  She...  She...  She...  She...  That's great.  That's great.  That's why we do these themes. 
[00:20:30]  Judas...  Judas, get me a priest.  Hey, that's...  Gotta give credit to these...  To Matt and Kelly for that.  That's a good one.  That's really good, Matt and Kelly.  Oh, there's more bands.  Yes, of course there is.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Metal bands.  Oh, what are some other popular ones?  Oh, no.  You could go with the obvious deaf leopard. 
[00:21:00]  Mushy crew?  No, that's not even good.  Death leopard.  Hey, there you go.  Coke logic.  He knows.  He's just writing brilliant.  Of course it's brilliant.  Of course it is.  Didn't he do it?  No, it was Matt and Kelly.  Matt and Kelly gets credit for that one.  Rage Against the Turn Off the Machine.  Brain Dead Zeppelin.  Oh, wow. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, old mush head.  Poor dummy.  I love it.  I love it.  Oh.  I'm going to think of 40 bands at 1102.  Oh, exactly.  Ah, we'll just do the bit tomorrow.  Someone remind us.  Who cares? 
[00:22:00]  Homework assignment for everybody.  We're on to something.  Poor Terry.  All right, we're going to try this again.  We failed miserably just before the first break, but we got wake up your spouse slash  roommate slash significant under whoever the F you're living with Tuesday.  And we got Joe in Massachusetts.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, man.  What's up?  Hey.  My girlfriend's sleeping in the other room.  And I was thinking I was going to wake her up with a nice good morning brownies between  my cheeks.  Um, let's think if that even made the air. 
[00:22:30]  I'm trying to think of how you're going to do that.  Are you just going to wake her up by pretty much sitting on her?  Yeah, pretty much.  All right.  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  Yeah, yeah.  We all know.  Yeah.  It's early morning.  When you said pretty much, we get it.  So there's a little something else attached to that.  Well, it's early morning.  I'm assuming, you know, people sleep in various states of dress or undress, things like that. 
[00:23:00]  So I don't know how this guy sleeps, but he's going to give that a whirl.  Coming in on instant feedback, ungrateful dead and rage against the breathing machine.  Hey, I did that one already.  Well, he moved it around a little bit.  Ripped me off.  Burn and fill it.  All right, Joe.  So let's give this a shot and see if this bit has legs.  The zombie.  Steven, that's from Bayshore. 
[00:23:30]  Iron, long, maiden.  All right, Joe, let's go.  All right.  Oh, I got to be pretty quiet, so I'm going to put on speakerphone right now.  All right, speakerphone.  Speakerphone up.  Let's go.  Here we go.  One second.  All right.  Let's go.  Okay.  Wake up your spouse Tuesday.  All right. 
[00:24:00]  So she's laying down right now.  She's pretty sleepy, so.  Motor lung.  Hey.  Hey, baby, wake up.  Wake up.  What the fuck are you doing, Joe?  Hey, hey, look.  You want it?  Hey.  Joe.  Cut it out.  Good morning. 
[00:24:30]  Good morning, baby.  You just farted on me.  Say good morning, baby.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Say good morning.  Good morning, Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  Good morning.  Good morning to you.  Hey, please have you wake up at the O&A show.  By the way, most of that made both sides of the radio, but she did say, she dropped an  F-bomb.  She dropped an F-bomb and said, you farted on me.  Wouldn't.  Wouldn't.  Oh, my God. 
[00:25:00]  That was hilarious.  All right, Joe.  You've kept the bit alive.  The grunge band Morana.  Yeah.  See you, guys.  All right, Joe.  Good job.  And what's your wife's name?  What?  What's your wife's name?  Michelle.  All right.  Thank you to Michelle as well.  All right, guys.  Have a good day.  Yeah, you too.  All right.  You want to try one more of these?  John in Boston?

[00:25:30]  What's up, John?  Hey, what's going on?  Good.  Hey.  Hey.  Hold on.  Did most of them make the radio with that dump?  The one dump was right in the middle of the goodness stuff.  REO Meatwagon.  Mudbrain.  It's two-bit Tuesday.  We do two bits at the same time.  Someone's cell phone writing.  Mudbrain. 
[00:26:00]  Mudbrain.  No food fighters.  And henchmen from Brooklyn instead of the who?  The huh?  All right.  John, what do you got?  Pink void.  All right.  I got a co-worker.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I think we're going to have to not do this bit for a while.  Pink void.  Hold on a minute.  You're doing a rock scream.  Come on.  Oh, slay her. 
[00:26:30]  Thomas from Dallas.  Deep purple face.  Disconnect the tubes.  Fool.  Fool.  You got to think about that one a little bit.  Took me a couple of minutes.  Fool.  Fool.  You got to think about that one a little bit. 
[00:27:00]  Quiet lump.  Oh, shivo jokes rule.  X-halin.  Heard from Philly.  System of a down pillow.

[00:28:30]  It's just hurtful.  Yeah.  Limited air supply.  Limp everything. 
[00:29:00]  How about the old Long Island band, Rothead?  Oh, our own Tim has one.  What?  Nine inch coffin nails.  Thin Terry.  Oh.  Oh.  That's too... 
[00:29:30]  What?  Snap man has a real band name.  Yeah.  Bad brain.  Twisted sister.  They kind of work.  Yeah.  It's the opposite, though.  You're damn right you're gonna take it.  Sit there.  And we lost our guy now.  Aw.  Which is fine.  It's all right.  It's all right.  It happens.  Of course it is.  All right.  We got a cute little story coming in.  Coming into the newsroom. 
[00:30:00]  The Opie and Anthony newsroom.  This is actually really funny.  Some dude, I guess he ordered a stripper to his house.  Yeah.  Girl comes over, does her thing.  People have done that, sure.  I think it's...  It's big hit at bachelor parties.  To just...  No.  But yeah, you could do that to your...  This is just a lonely guy decides to call up a stripper to have her come over and do  a little stripping.  And I'm probably hoping that he'll get a little more out of it, right?  Yeah.  Listen to what happens.  Nance gave an unexpected performance at this house on Evans Avenue Friday morning. 
[00:30:30]  The exotic dancer came to the Port St. Lucie home to entertain 46-year-old Daniel Karpinski.  Suddenly, Nance noticed something wrong.  I tried to wait for a few seconds and basically I had to regulate learning CPR in the fourth grade.  CPR?  The guy just wanted to have a little fun, orders a stripper, she gets there and he has  some kind of problem where she's got to administer CPR.  Oh man, he got too excited. 
[00:31:00]  Nance talked with our partners at Scripps Treasure Coast Newspapers.  Police say Karpinski lost consciousness and stopped breathing.  Nance started CPR.  I began doing CPR and did about three cycles of CPR and basically called 911 at the same  time to see if I was doing it correctly and also to have the ambulance rushed to the scene.  Paramedics rushed Karpinski from the home to St. Lucie Medical Center.  He now considers the dancer his hero. 
[00:31:30]  Karnisha Nance is just glad she remembered an old lesson.  Thank God for learning CPR in fourth grade.  What the F?  She probably caused the heart attack too when she lifted her skirt and he realized it was a tranny.  Steve from Pedro saying he had a heart attack.  We are beyond silly today, which is fine.  Dude, I'm up all night.  I drank a coffee last night at 9.30 and I just, why did I do it? 
[00:32:00]  Oh, you couldn't sleep.  I craved a cup of coffee.  I'm like, you'll be fine.  Oh, cup of Joe.  Five hours I laid there.  Isn't that the worst?  That's good though.  Now we're all in silly mode because of it.  That's right.  Most strippers in that situation would just kind of...  Rob you.  Kind of do the old Caddyshack.  Walk away like Bill Murray did when the priest got hit by the bolt of lightning.  We call it the old Caddyshack move.  Yeah.  There's not many strippers that would actually sit there and save your life.  They would make believe they never showed up at your door. 
[00:32:30]  Rifle through your pockets first.  Right.  Take whatever they can and just kind of sneak out the door, closing the door very lightly behind them.  Those dummies that try to save your life by putting a tape because they remembered you had to practice VCR.  I knew it was another letter.  Downtown Dave, the no cure.  Of course, the strokes.  Oh.  Yes.  Of course. 
[00:33:00]  That's coming in a lot.  John from Vegas and many others on that one.  So what do you think of that story?  Pretty good?  Yeah.  It's interesting.  It's a little interesting human interest type of story.  Well, you don't usually come across your everyday whore that could save your life.  Although, now he considers her his hero.  That means stalker.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's going to come into like the strip club she works in or something.  Hey, here is the first time.  It'll be like, hey, that'll be good.  And that'll be there every night. 
[00:33:30]  I was going to ask you, when does it go from, it's cool.  Like, she's even excited.  Like, oh, my God, you're the guy that.  Yeah.  And then she calls all her stripper friends around like, he's the one I told you about,  you know, on the news, blah, blah, blah.  When does it go from that to, oh, my God, he's here again.  Here he comes again.  Oh, my God.  He's here again.  She turns to the biker.  Could you get rid of him, please?  Punch his chest on the left side.  You're going to have to leave, FUD.  Because that's always the case in those situations. 
[00:34:00]  It's cool for a little while, then it's like, all right, enough.  Move on with your stupid life, will you?  Struggling for Aerosmith.  Now people are just doing songs.  Of course.  Green Day, good riddance.  That's Nate Sack, yes.  Hey, by the way, it's official.  Tim has made a sweeper, so now it's official.  It's Wake Up Your Roommate Tuesday.

[00:46:30]  reading's stupid reading's overrated 877-212-0-n-a  you want to acknowledge that you're on top of things but when it comes to just reading and that's all 
[00:47:00]  you do on your morning show why you don't deserve big ratings for that go to the papers hit me you  can't hurt me suck my kills you say you handle a story you'll read the paper you look look at this  giuliani's daughter's a liberal endorsing obama well what do you know how great is that though what do  you know and i were talking in office about that every daughter does that to their father but uh you  know giuliani has a little more to lose than than uh like the mechanic guy you know and his daughter's 
[00:47:30]  like acting out that's right it looks like rudy giuliani's 17 year old daughter caroline may be an  obama girl hey you're reading strange from her conservative dad caroline giuliani joined an  online support group for democratic uh democrat barack obama and listed her politics as liberal  in her facebook profile i'm reading out of the paper someone shoot me well you know what uh  uh giuliani was uh he was quoted yeah saying uh look uh she's free to endorse her as long as she 
[00:48:00]  doesn't one have to agree but daddy's a little pissed off and uh that entry in her facebook is now  gone yeah deleted well uh yeah she also put out a little statement saying what just saying you know  she's uh pretty much uh i asked you that has different politics do you want me to read a lot 
[00:48:30]  of the paper well no because i i do some of that reading yeah but after like the second paragraph  move on to the next story so that was later on in the article obviously she says she has different  politics you know than her dad and just you know uh that's uh what she wanted to do so looks like  someone's getting back at daddy but yeah well at least in that way daddy didn't send her to europe  one summer in the uh ways to get back at daddy yeah uh voting for somebody else not bad that's up there 
[00:49:00]  though no because that's not bad because that's all juliana cares about i'm just saying it's up there i  mean as just a father let's put it this way it could be the top five but the top four are  doozies we all know what the top what's the top one well is it or stripping  uh no i'd say it's not stripping no i'd say it's when you come home and your daddy goes do you support 
[00:49:30]  obama and you pat your belly and go i have to now that'd be number one  that's why i i i really find it hard to uh see obama winning this not not because you know  new york's pretty liberal yeah a lot of the big cities uh that we're hurting pretty liberal  but there is a lot of country a lot of real that the father thinking of his daughter a white father 
[00:50:00]  thinking of his daughter coming home with somebody of a different race still upsets him still very  upsetting to a lot of dads and i think that gets in the way black dads too don't like it no of course  not i was gonna ask that very thing today because we always that's the stating the obvious but does it  work the other way yes do black parents uh get a little annoyed if if their daughter's coming home  with the white boy they're just as they're just as racially biased they they think the same way as 
[00:50:30]  white people it's not even racial bias it's it's basic human nature we for the most part like hanging  out with people of our own kind that's what like uh at the animal kingdom does that's what people do  i mean i of course every uh so often you see a group of people looking like a benetton ad  or a sunny d commercial but for the most part when you go out with your friends it's a group of  whatever race you are that's why you see uh hispanic people hanging out with hispanics black people 
[00:51:00]  hang out with black people white people hanging out with white people all right you said that's how  it is in the animal kingdom right yeah all right you're a very smart guy right thank you explain the  zebra zebras are a whole animal unto themselves but they they did some exploring back in the day when  there are like woolly mammoths roaming around i don't think so i think the zebra has just had has  a nice uh uh camouflage explain the zebra it's i'm with you with all other animals hanging out 
[00:51:30]  with their kind it breaks up their line what's something camouflage the moors oh invaded the  unicorns oh i love this guy the more stupid zebra doesn't know what it wants to be so you're great  are you are you a horse great grandmother zebra uh yeah that's right she uh had a zebra kid yeah  yeah yeah stupid zebra all right hey uh the stock market it's up it's down yeah where are we at today 
[00:52:00]  well when we last left the stock market it was up i believe 286 points  after crashing the day before what does that mean i honestly god don't know what how does that what  does the market going up mean like where the market's at zero is that bad what is it well it's uh there  are certain stocks in the dow jones industrial average they take those stocks and through some uh 
[00:52:30]  a formula uh average them and and come up with what the dow jones industrial average did that day  if it's up it means the stock market had a good day if it's down it had a bad day  they have the blue chip stocks in there all the important you know some of the important stocks  are in there and it's a good gauge i don't know those are important stocks they're from different  sectors they give a good overall view of uh of industry in uh this country and in uh foreign 
[00:53:00]  countries how well it's doing our blue chip stocks uh uh say tasty cake on tires no i don't believe  tasty cake would be in there you're looking at something like general electric uh even though they're  they're bad having a bad year uh a ford motor company would be like a blue chip microsoft is uh part of uh 
[00:53:30]  of the uh dow jones ted's bicycle horn emporium is part of the dow jones industrial they just make  well bicycle horns the company that makes these yes has quite the say on how the market does on any  given day the people there's whistlery the people that play the market are just a bunch of panicky  and that's why it goes up it goes down they're just panicking all the time there is no rhyme or 
[00:54:00]  reason to it i don't understand how one day the market can drop a couple hundred points and the  next day it goes up a couple hundred points i i could explain it uh simply by saying crystal meth  crystal meth you think they're all on crystal meth they're just down there on wall street they're  just panicky one day on one day off so one day they're fine yeah they're like a little relaxed go  yeah it looked good uh some earnings came out today uh they were above what the street expected

[01:01:00]  all did all that stock every once in a while he'll call me up and go uh you know your ratings are  are a bit low in grand rapids i'm like yeah yeah whatever will you get my citadel stock up please  you know what else is low right farid you want to talk about low the price  jesus four dollars and fifty six cents and jimmy oh i went all in oh i went all in  because i remember the days when you got an opportunity to get into an ipo yes it was 
[01:01:30]  guaranteed millionaire for everybody no one gets into ipos just the privileged few that's right  initial public offering you get in and it's only people that know people you know and you can get  through your broker but it's very difficult to get in at that price because it's such a good price  it's the hov lane to wealth and riches that's right if you would have gotten in on the ipo of google 
[01:02:00]  you would have paid something like 90 something dollars a share which is a huge price for an ipo a lot  what is google at today it would have cost you 90 something dollars now usually you know you're  paying in the teens or 20s maybe even 30s for an ipo it's 501 dollars 510 a share where was that ipo  farid imagine getting in and and buying uh that much a lot of stock at 90 a share ridiculous you lose 
[01:02:30]  money that way why would you spend 90 when when it's 500 now that's a waste of money yes it's a  bad buy terrible it would have been horrid that's a tough buy though per share 99 a share not many  people have that kind of money it was a it was a biggie but let me tell you it beats 19 and then  looking at five yeah five stop saying five i wish it was five and that was after a big day yesterday 
[01:03:00]  yes that was after like a 286 uh point climb yesterday well hey wonderful this leads to  jim kramer flipping out it's all over the video websites uh kramer does what cnbc yeah he does a  cnbc or uh well yeah one of those he does like a stock show that's all wild and wacky he uses sound  effects he yells at people he takes a lot of calls people ask him what do you think about uh you know  like google and he'll be whoa let me tell you about that that price now is too high to do it 
[01:03:30]  you gotta watch stop stop he just goes crazy yeah and uh and apparently he went really a berserk  yesterday on someone else's show yeah she's trying to ask him questions and he's just losing his mind  it's it's the the the googly eyed girl the google eyed girl googly eyed she's got uh what's her name  everyone thinks she's hot i don't know i don't really she's wall eyed what the hell is her name  sue simmons sue simmons way to go local for new york there you go i love sue simmons check off new

[01:05:30]  would do things with the interest rates and stuff to try to keep the market a little more stable  and this new guy that's in there is uh just doom and gloom he uh he doesn't know how to uh work the  interest rates to keep things stable the the housing markets uh screwy the mortgage companies are are  it's armageddon the guy was well here yeah kramer continues out of his mind he hasn't seen it like  this since 1990 kramer i have not seen it like this since i went five bid for a half a million

[01:09:00]  yeah stop it just stop shut up we leave that for  ten ten wins and stuff yesterday two days ago whatever i know i saw it on uh youtube uh a couple  of days ago who cares just shut up we're talking about it now that meltdown could have been in 1984  yeah i know about stock who cares as far as the show goes it doesn't matter when it happened  according to uh let's see january 27 2000 episode of high net worth cnbc kramer has accumulated a net  worth of over 100 million dollars oh that guy's got over 100 million bucks and he's yelling like that 
[01:09:30]  taking a chance of a heart attack that i'm sure his money is safe the only thing he should be yelling  at is where can i get my  i want my  how many whores can i get  right now  when green span was in i had horse my all night 
[01:10:00]  it's the only thing he should be upset about but you know he's probably annoying at dinner like  people just want to talk to him but he has to be like the guy from tv  yeah oh yeah yeah points over the pot roast and they're like just would you just stop it  i asked for well done  this is rare  i mean relax someone's suggesting that maybe our own club soda kenny is now uh in alan green's uh  spans job i don't like anything green 
[01:10:30]  who is he  he used to be the head of the um  the fed the chairman of the um  you know the treasury guy nasda  the big guy if you big the big cheese  the guy that uh dictated interest rates  if he farted the market would go down  yeah  he was that powerful  no i i don't even know  of course you know  and now people are suggesting you might be alan green's  band's replacement because there's doom and gloom in the market  no i i guess people know what they're talking about 
[01:11:00]  and none of us like the way your shirt is tucked in  it just gives me the creeps  yeah  because it's buttoned on top and tucked in  i'm neat  it's just wrong  it's pulled too high your trousers  kenny's slacks are pulled too high  he's got high pulled slacks  he pulls his slacks up to his navel  they're at my waist  they are slacks  not like your slacks pulled up so high  they're at my waist  all right  did you get them at wallach's

[01:12:00]  the listener  we get great stuff from our listeners  well  sometimes  well we only play the great stuff  that's true  we get a lot of stuff from the listeners  the bad stuff we pile up in a mountain  yeah they mean well  yeah but see we make the listeners look like radio stars  yeah  we should just play everything that the listeners give us  ugh  wow  there's some pretty bad stuff there 
[01:12:30]  then you would understand how to do a radio show  you know  yeah  some days we got radio gold  and other days because we're just  just kind of trying to make it happen  we fall flat on our faces  but see the listeners  we weed through all this stuff  and get rid of all the crap  and just give you the best of the best  yeah so they look great  they have a best of all the time  look at the favor we do  see some people moan and groan  when we go on vacation  or take a day off  but that  when we do that  it's guaranteed to be a good radio show 
[01:13:00]  because we only give you the best of the best  right  we don't like  you know  replay all the times  we just sucked  phone number  877-212-ONA  it's wake up your spouse  slash roommate  slash significant other  slash whatever  Tuesday  slash domestic partner  yeah  just  give him a tug  wake up sweetie  we believe this is worth playing 
[01:13:30]  again  it happened very early  on the show  wake up call from Joe  Joe woke up his wife  and it was really funny  but she cursed in the middle of it  and we weren't sure  how much of this was heard  out there  in radio land  so we're going to play it again  so Joe  got a great idea  on how to wake up  his wife  yeah  and this is how it went down  about an hour  hour and 15 minutes ago  Joe what's up  my girlfriend's sleeping  in the other room  and I was thinking  I was going to wake her up  alright Joe  let's go  alright

[01:15:30]  yeah we are  because we want to  we want to do  what the hell is that  again  because it was so good  constantly looking for freaks  but I think we got to update  the promo Steve  with all the new stuff  we got  so it sounds new  and maybe you could tell people  it worked so well  we want to do it again  because if some people  are thinking we're still  playing the same old promo  yeah  they're not going to call up  because they're going to go  oh look they're making a mistake  and playing the same old promo  right  but we want to do it again  so we got to update that  just write a note or something  speaking of which  what the hell is that 
[01:16:00]  Boston Remix  Remix by RPI  we farmed out the audio  to a few of the regulars  yeah  and RPI took some of the audio  from what the hell is that  and came up with this  what the hell is that  goodness gracious  I'm sorry  you  I'd say  it could be  I'm not arguing  which is worse  what is that  that would squirt  across the room  I bet  of all the dramatic things  I've ever seen  Jesus Christ  holy crap 
[01:16:30]  oh  oh my god  I can't look  what is that  oh Jesus  this is the worst show  I've ever done  Bobby and Anthony  yeah  RPI  very good  good job there 
[01:17:00]  Bob Kelly puking in there  and everything  yeah we got your video of the day  and  here's the story  it's the father in the courtroom  have you seen this yet Jimmy  briefly yeah  I'm trying to get to see it again though  because he does what  you should be able to do  oh  absolutely  god bless this guy  the officers in the courtroom  should just let the guy go for a while  it's their job though  it's just  it's  police stop man who attacks murderer in courtroom  this is the video they're showing all over the TV today 
[01:17:30]  chaos erupted in the Jefferson County courtroom on Monday  when a murder victim's father attacked a defendant  Michael Sweat plunged toward Antonio Clifford  the man who pleaded guilty to aggravated murder  in death of  in the death of Joshua Sweat  Swede or Sweat  Michael Sweat was set to walk to the stand  to give his victim impact statement  instead he plunged toward the defendant  god bless this guy  and put his hands around Clifford's neck  and started choking him  in the end no deputies or officers were left injured 
[01:18:00]  and that's why Abdel said he didn't arrest Sweat  so he went after him  and he was choking him pretty good  and then they got on top of him  and removed him from the defendant  that's why god you just want these guys  to have like a knife on them or something  just plunge it into the side of this guy's neck  yeah  just end it already  this guy isn't going to care that he's in prison  probably been in and out of prison anyway 
[01:18:30]  murders this guy's son  and the guy loses his mind  I love seeing stuff like that  I mean one of the best ones  was the guy that molested a guy's son  karate instructor  oh god that was a great one  and they're leading him out  and the father is just sitting there  standing next to a payphone  like he's making a call  as they're leading him  right behind him in the hallway  he's got a gun on him  he spins around 
[01:19:00]  boom pops him once in the head  puts the gun down  they pin him against the wall  but job done  job well done  do we know what ever happened to that guy  because that is a  a great video  that we've all seen many many times  I have no idea what happened to him  I know he did have to go to jail  but how much time  for some time  I don't know if he went to jail at all actually  I think  wow that would be great  if anyone knows  if someone could find info on that  I believe he was acquitted on justifiable homicide  I think he was acquitted by a jury 
[01:19:30]  you know what sucks  the sheriff in the courtroom  Fred Abdallah  it looks like  News 9 Cruz  talked with Sheriff Fred Abdallah  who was the first to get to sweat  in the courtroom  and he's kind of bragging in a weird way here  as he was lunging across the table  to get him  that's when I was able to reach down  and stop him  said Abdallah  get him over there  and get him thrown on the floor  great  well congratulations  that you did your job  no one would have minded  if you took your time  could have checked your watch  yeah  oh boy 
[01:20:00]  almost break time  something like that  you know  let him get a few chokes in  squeeze the guys  was the guy cuffed  I'm sure he was at the time  yeah  that's what they should do though  is just hand the victim's family  a bat or a stick  and let you just  just do it until you're tired  I know  there are great  like  little things like that  like wouldn't it be great  if you give the family this  and that  but it just doesn't happen  I hate playing the  wouldn't it be great game  I know  it's never  gonna happen  cause you might as well 
[01:20:30]  just go to the best thing ever  just like  stomp his  brains out  with your  boot heel  just ridiculous  this guy gets to sit there  he's gonna end up in  prison  who cares  he'll get to work out  hang out with his buddies  and  just go  go about his life  but he'll be in prison  who cares  yeah  cause after a while  we've talked about it on the show  it becomes your life  everything just becomes your life  no one wants to be in prison  but 
[01:21:00]  once you're there  that's your life  that's now where you live  you gotta pay attention to people  you  you  you make friends  you make enemies  you search out entertainment  you try to have a little fun  here and there  you work  that's what it is  it just becomes  a new  life  you go to the library  and learn about something  you have people that go  into the military  they go from a civilian life  hanging out with their friends  doing things  into the army  where they have people  telling them what to do  you know 
[01:21:30]  they gotta be  certain place  certain time  do things  that then becomes your life  prisons are the same thing  that's why  I'm so for the death penalty  gone  goodbye  burden  taken care of  I'm for the death penalty  for just ridiculous stuff too  I think they ought to have it  for more than just  capital murder  that's for sure  oh yeah  how about  how about  child molestation  how about  rape  and I'm not talking  you know 
[01:22:00]  the rape that  sometimes  you don't know  you don't  you know  there's that kind  I'm just talking  your blatant  guy comes in  through the window  and  rapes a woman  how about  dancing on the sabbath  oh I thought you were  going to say  dancing on the ceiling  no  dancing on the sabbath  how about  obscene film rentals  I've gone against  the death penalty  I used to be  completely for it  oh I'm so for it  because  I just don't think  that everyone gets  the same amount of legal 
[01:22:30]  hey  sorry  never said anything  about  you know  some people being  a little more privileged  than others  well it's supposed  to be impartial  yeah well  everything is supposed  to be something  and it's not  yeah well  we got Johnny Vegas  of course  for this argument  yeah we should get  Iran's justice system  that's such a great country  I'm not saying that  one extreme of the other  douche  come on  what am I saying  I'm not saying  chop hands off  of people that  steal stuff  although it's pretty good  that would be a good one 
[01:23:00]  off with your hands  a bunch of  handless people  walking around  you just point at them  and go  thief  laugh  pick things up  thief  or hard factory worker  I can't determine  what you are  we got an update  on the father  who shot that guy  when he was hanging out  by the phone booth  as they're  you know  taking the victim  the victim  the perp  thank you  naughty boy  out of the courtroom  it's John from Yonkers  John  yeah hi guys  hey  he did 30 days  and it went down 
[01:23:30]  like Jimmy said  justifiable homicide  the reason why  he did 30 days  is because  it was the first time  they ever had a case  like that  and they held him  for 30 days  for gun possession  but you know  it was great  it was great  you know  if we had more of these  there'd be less guys  out there  thinking that they  can do whatever  they want  he only got 30 days  yeah well that was  again  the jury acquitted him  as they should have  Anthony is like  Vic Morrow's character  in the Twilight Zone movie 
[01:24:00]  I am not  gonna walk out of the bar  god damn  I'm only against  the death penalty  for those reasons  I don't think  liberals will a lot of times  say it's cruel and unusual  but I don't think it is  I think it's perfectly  acceptable  I just have a problem  with the way  we kind of come to  the conclusion  that's it  look  I don't care  who's got this  that money  better defense  this  if someone is 
[01:24:30]  honestly  guilty  of  of a murder  they should be put  to death  there are some  circumstances  where it's not  this  you know  the  prosecution  is trying  their  damnedest  to just find  somebody guilty  I'm talking  cases where  it's  definitely  the guy  but that's  what it's supposed  to be  I agree with you  but that's  what it's supposed  to be  and how many  guys are released  from prison  after 22 years  because of DNA  or people  can't 
[01:25:00]  something  well then  go  go back  to old  cases  and do  that  because  these  days  they're  using  DNA  I don't  think  they're  convicting  a lot  of  innocent  people  these  days  we got  some  great  CSI  stuff  now  yeah  I watch  the shows  that's it  CSI  I got  your hair  it's you  juice  them  that's what  I say  that's not  my follicle  is that  the footage  oh please  play that  for me  yeah here  it is  father of  kidnapped  son  gets revenge  throw that 
[01:25:30]  in the  search  bam  just shoots  him  drops the  gun  and they  put him  against  the wall  he does  have the  hacked  disguise  by the  way  the hat  and the  sunglasses  the worst  disguise  ever  that's not  too  suspicious  in a  courtroom  out of a  disguise  book  I'm surprised  the shot  looks like  Bill who  used to  work for  us  yeah  he used  to  he went  back to  school for  now  we'll bring  him back  though  doesn't he  look like  Bill  he sure  does  play that  again  same  sexual  preferences  too  drops the 
[01:26:00]  gun  and look  there you  go  nice  guy  got him  with a  headshot  too  the disguise  is awful  though  just awful  yeah  he should  have  wear those  he should  wear  groucho  glasses  or maybe  the glasses  with the  springs  on them  top out  eyeballs  perhaps a  Sesame Street  head  there's a  Grover on  the phone  he couldn't  be in  trouble  Grover's  very friendly  a little  slow-mo  see the  guy walked  in the  way  you can  see right  when he  got it  headshot  though  definitely 
[01:26:30]  alright  check that  out on  your  own  time  let's go  to Tommy  in Detroit  this can't  be possible  Tommy  what's up  hey how's  it going  man  yeah  that guy  was actually  found to be  innocent  yeah  I remember  watching it  on an  early  I used to  have a  face  with a  death  tape  he was  originally  but then  they went  back and  got him  because he  had the  gun thing  but he  crossed state  lines  it was a  whole drug  thing  Iraq did  he shoot  from the 
[01:27:00]  hip  it looks  like it  it looks  like he  shot under  his left  arm  yeah because  he still  had the  phone  on his  left arm  yeah this  guy was a  good shot  I know  he's  that's  like trick  shooting  I know  he's pretty  close to  the guy  but still  yeah  look at  the guy's  moving  he never  dropped the  phone from  his left  head  he's shooting  up at  him  but he  didn't  shoot  the  cops  that's  the  problem  look at  this guy  how close  he came  to getting  a little  collateral  damage  oh well  good for 
[01:27:30]  him  he's alive  he never  sees it  coming  this guy  all of a  sudden  he ceases  to exist  probably for  a split  second  it felt  like a  2x4  hit him  in the  head  and then  you're  just  gone  don't  stop  believing  just  ends  like  that  that  goes  to  black  you think  it just  went  to  black  to  exist  all right  why don't  we take  a break  and  we'll  just  take  one  we kind  of  gotta  catch up  a little  bit  one of  those  shows  these  commercials  it's  opian  anthony  and  jim

[01:29:30]  just talking and  all of a sudden i'm  like there are no  words to come out of  your mouth  nothing  we talked about  princess diana being  dead for 10 years  10 years uh at the  end of the month and  uh elvis presley 30  years august 16th  30  and on the cover of  readers digest as i'm  on the bowl this  morning is uh the  diana memoirs or the  and it can i'm i'm  tired of the books  about this broad  we we get it  women love this  broad she was i  know because she's  everything they're not  a lot of women she's  everything they're not  she was glamorous and 
[01:30:00]  she helped people  but you know what  charles couldn't take  her nagging her  attention-seeking  anymore so he went  over to that horse  face how great is  that no matter how  hot diana was she  was just an  attention-seeking  bitch in his eyes  and he had to go to  horse face  traded her in for a  horse face  she certainly did  right after camilla  bowls through  christopher reeve  her and charles  re-hooked up  she was damaged  goods man she knew  that uh you know  the prince charles  guy there wasn't in  love with her but she  stayed in the marriage 
[01:30:30]  and that was one of  those you know it's  royalty one of them  royalty things  well you know what if  you're this uh this  powerful woman then  you you you you go  screw the royalty i  already got the son so  i got that connection i'm  going to move on with  my life why stay in  it i think she uh  developed that over  time i think at first  she was very like kind  of shy and yeah you  know didn't know the  deal and then she kind  of as she got older she  was like oh boy this is  for the birds yeah i'll  just take off she was  rich anyway i'm sure she  was awful in bed too 
[01:31:00]  oh  oh  oh  oh  i just picture the  english being horrible in  bed  just hard oh is this  good love  yes you enjoying this  then  yes rather yes good  yeah just missionary all  the time camilla's  probably a pig that's  why charles loves her  she makes plunger  noises  you thought that too  right  you know stupid diana  was all like oh  oh with the crown on  that crown on dopey 
[01:31:30]  lance kerwin hairdo  yeah it doesn't want to  get messy don't mess up  my hair don't mess up  uh nothing  jimmy i'm with you on  that one man i thought  the same thing i'm like  what did he see in  that horse like banging  adam rich stupid diana's  hair  she went to like some  egyptian or some some uh  uh like arabic uh doctor  and then dodie fire boy  she loved it she loved the  uh she loved it  they're probably passionate  yeah  unclipped  big  yeah  real men 
[01:32:00]  when the english are done  they're probably like oh  oh yes um  cheers  cheers  night  yeah  rather  it's an awful night  not camilla  no  camilla parker bulls  animal  she pins charles's legs  behind his ears  and does a little  does a little cleanup  would you like me to get a  towel  no need chuck  i'm appreciative 
[01:32:30]  why else would he go  let me show my appreciation  she was great  he just hangs a bag of oats  off the side of the bed  she'd bury that big dumb  horse face in it  he'd look at her big awful  ass and go what do i see  in her  then his little british legs  are pinned behind his head  he's like oh yeah  she's what we call a good egg  she's not trying to get dirty  oh not at all  she didn't care  she clips all of her nails  before she gets into bed  wink wink  nudge nudge  do you remember we lost that

[01:37:00]  you just  i don't mind the broad expression  i mean sinatra said it  and it sounded okay  right  but could you get rid of the old  but relatively speaking  we had just been on the phone  with a 12 year old girl  yeah  you have to get seven 12 year olds together  to match your age  exactly  methuselah  you're on line one  now gentlemen  are you going to allow me  to have one little say here  yeah we never let marge  get a word in edgewise  we're going to give you  30 seconds marge  and then we're going to  beat the hell out of you  first of all 
[01:37:30]  yes  for some reason  and i'm not sure  what that reason is  you guys don't think  i work at little shelter  right  all right  well you know  that's ridiculous  that is absolutely absurd  can i ask  i don't work  at the shelter  but i work  from home  if you've ever  judge  all right  now wait a minute  you have to  you have to  wait and listen  okay  um  i know that 
[01:38:00]  your brother  was there yesterday  brett  and adopted a pet  and he could see  how tiny  time out  no no no  no no  that's exactly why  we got you on the line  today there  marge  marge  marge  marge  seriously  you gotta listen to me  first of all  what's your position  at little shelter  i'm the pr person  all right  you're the pr person  do they pay you  yes they do  who told you that  my brother brett  the owner of fh riley's  in the heart of huntington village  400 new york avenue  uh 
[01:38:30]  adopted a pet yesterday  arlene told me  yesterday he adopted what  she actually called me  from the shelter  and said marge  you will never believe  who just walked in here  and i said  who  she said opie's brother  brett hughes  uh brett hughes  yes  is a animal lover  marge  that's why we have you  on the line  now listen  i thought you were running  out of cornish game hens  down at the restaurant  and he was adorable  and wonderful 
[01:39:00]  and if he was there  if he spoke to arlene  if he was in her office  that would answer the question  as to  marge  wait wait wait  first of all marge  marge does not work  all right listen  marge let me tell the story  let me tell the story  it's a little different  because it came from my brother  this isn't hearsay  my brother brett called me  and told me about his experience  and that's why we have you  on the phone  and we worst of all  he didn't  hearsay through you now  all right  i want to hear  everything that he said  but i have to  technically it's hearsay  that you're saying it  not really 
[01:39:30]  yeah but it's blood  it's heresy  and by the way marge  we will plug the  north shore animal league  don't you worry  you know what  hey you're concerned  about it plugging  516-883-7575  the north shore animal league  their motto is  we don't kill them  like the shelter  first of all  marge  what dog killer  if i let you  you can take  your best shot at me  no  i'm not taking  i'm gonna just tell you  a little story  all right  my brother brett  who yes is the owner 
[01:40:00]  of fh riley's  in huntington village  400 york avenue  in cheesecake  with little dog paws  around him  uh he did not adopt  he did not adopt  a pet  no  from little shelter  yesterday  he was at little shelter  he was at little shelter  last week  let me tell you the story  he heard about little shelter  from this fine radio show  and he found a cat  a kitten  a cute little kitten  aww  and he already has  five or six pets at home  and he found out that 
[01:40:30]  this kitten is blind  so because of all the time  you've done on the  Opie and Anthony show  he goes  i'm going to the little shelter  with this little blind kitten  this little cute blind kitten  and and and they'll know  what to do  so he uh he drives up  to little shelter  the little blind kitten  is in the car  i hope my brother  calls during this  he'll back me up  and he goes in  asking for you  little shelter uh said  that you do not work  for little shelter  oh that's such a lie 
[01:41:00]  i'm just telling you  what my brother said  well maybe they were  talking to some  degenerate off the street  i'm just saying  that's what my brother  said  and then my brother  proceeded to say  well i have this blind  little kitten in my truck  it needs a home  they would not take  the little blind kitten  oh my god  he even went  is there  if you go around  back or something  is there some kind  of cattery  the cattery  all right  so he even drove  to the back  where the cattery is 
[01:41:30]  Opie  Opie  there are 300  gas chamber  whatever  cats in the cattery  right  350  right  more than the state  of Arkansas  what  go ahead  what do you mean  oh she's having  a nervous breakdown  Marge  by the way  can't guess what  Marge looks like  she's totally nude  wearing sneakers  and diapers  no bra  oh wait a minute guys  you finally said  something that's true  I never wear a bra  yuck  usually that's hot 
[01:42:00]  puppies have to eat  hold on stupid  we're laughing at you  that's when my  powdered milk  comes out at this point  she just got back  from Atlanta  she was feeding  Michael Vick's dog  can I just say  yes Marge  yes Marge  they even let  OJ Simpson respond  yes  go ahead Marge  I don't know  about the situation  I thoroughly believe 
[01:42:30]  what you're saying  to me  I will make  I will call them  this morning  and find out  as a matter of fact  I'm going there  for a meeting today  I will find out  exactly what happened  Marge  and usually we  have fun going  back and forth  and beating you  up a little bit  but let's get  serious for a second  here  here's my brother  who's  who  obviously  he's my brother  from the Opie  and Anthony show  he says that  he's looking for  Marge from  Little Shelter  and he has this  kitten that is  in desperate need  of help  obviously you have  too many cats  in the cattery  right  and you can't 
[01:43:00]  just like take  every kitten in  I understand that  but why wouldn't  they take  this particular kitten  in knowing  that we're going  to talk about  it on the Opie  and Anthony show  this is horrible  PR for the Little Shelter  so now he's stuck  with a blind kitten  he doesn't have time  to raise a blind kitten  blind  now my turn  my turn  your turn go  okay  I've been  thinking about this  I have no answer  and I only have  an apology  at this point  until I find out  exactly what happened 
[01:43:30]  yes  we have dogs there  that are blind  deaf  have cancer  have heart disease  have one eye  sounds like a wonderful place  so this is not  a shelter  that turns animals  away  Marge  Marge  I hate to interrupt you  but Ving Reams  is on the phone  can you go over  and feed his dog  so let me find out  exactly what happened  and as far as  and let me tell you  as far as being  Democratic is concerned  gentlemen  yes  whether Mr. Hughes 
[01:44:00]  comes in  whether Mr. Clinton  comes in  whether Mr. Joe  comes in  we don't  make any  preferences  if we have the room  we're going to  take that animal in  not the fact  that you happen  to be  that Brett  happens to be  oh  no preferential  treatment  even for a blind  little kitty  why wouldn't  someone from  the little shelter  even come out  to the truck  to take a look  at the kitten  one of those whores  hold on  I'm going to  fade you down 
[01:44:30]  into the mix  because you will  not stop talking  but this is  another part of the story  then my brother  Brett goes  well could you  at least come out  to my truck  and take a look  at this kitten  it needs some  kind of help  I need some  advice  they would not  even leave  the little shelter  and go to his  truck for some  reasons  what is that  about  that's so  difficult to  believe  it's the truth  but I  again  look Marge  my brother  doesn't have to  like you know  try to entertain  an audience  he's just  telling me  brother to  brother  his experience  with little  shelter  I can no 
[01:45:00]  longer support  little shelter  that's right  oh my god  the north shore  animal league  and you know  what  I can't support  and all the  support we give  in Marge  and the little  shelter  over the last  year  what is the  story that I  heard yesterday  about Brett  coming to  little shelter  and saying  the most  wonderful things  about little  shelter  what was that  is that a  made up story  he's from  a different  mom  what  just kidding 
[01:45:30]  516-883-7575  the north shore  animal league  their motto is  we're not  whores  okay  we'll take  your blind  kittens  is there a sign  over little  shelter's entrance  that says  arbit macht  free  first of all  there are  shelters all  over New York  Long Island  all doing the  same thing  trying to rescue  animals  whether people  go to  north shore  animal league  whether they  come to  little shelter  by the way 
[01:46:00]  ARF  AC&C  they're all  doing the  same thing  and that is  rescuing an  animal before  they are  destroyed  not we  don't destroy  but there are  so many  shelters that  do  and we're  Sam from  FBA  the little  shelter  doesn't want  to kill  defenseless  animals  there's no  challenge in  that  yeah  kill the  blind one  that's too  easy  you can win  a chance  to run  through the  cattery with  a bat  with a nail  through it  you draw the  lucky number  animal shelter  which 
[01:46:30]  whichever one  take a few  swings in the  cattery  and adopt a  pet  by the way  the AC&C  has a wonderful  I want to go  cattery batting  bat or a  big fat  driver  golf club  for the  kittens  I want to see  them flying out  of a pitching  machine  just a bunch  of little fur  balls  I want to go  cattery bowling  see how many  naughty kittens  oh you need  a t-shirt  all right  Marge 
[01:47:00]  here's the  deal  I personally  cannot support  the little  shelter anymore  and all the  plugs we've  given you  over the  last year  unless you  get to the  bottom of the  story  I want a  full report  later this  week  I will give you  a full report  why didn't they  take the little  blind kitten away  from my brother  Brett who works  70 to 80  hours a week  at the restaurant  he doesn't have  time to give  this kitten  the proper care  it deserves  and needs  putting his  little glasses  on every two  seconds  I'm stupid  holding a cup  I can only  speculate 
[01:47:30]  it's time for  cat shovel  baseball  hit it  oh you missed  that one  Anthony  swinging  what  we're playing  I'm listening  if you want to  get anywhere  you should talk  to Greg Hughes  cat shovel  baseball  sounds from  the cattery  what actually  went on  oh yes  oh did I  nail that one  the fact that  he is  Opie  oh nice

[02:01:30]  blind kitty  already  I just  spoke to  the head  of the  incoming  admissions  department  at little  shelter  and they  know exactly  what happened  Brett came  in with the  little blind  kitty  they looked  at the  the death  machine was  broken  and they  told Brett  that the  cat needed  to be sent  to an  emergency  clinic  because it  seemed to  have  upper  respiratory  condition  we don't  have a  vet on  the premises 
[02:02:00]  we certainly  would love  to one  day  if we  ever have  enough money  to build  a medical  center  but we  don't have  a vet  on the  premises  and we  never  told  Brett  that we  would not  take the  kitty  she's lying  because Brett  didn't say  that they  never came  out to see  the cat  that's not  true  but that's  what they  said  well I  am telling  you exactly  what Jill  said  and she  says she  knows exactly  what happened  this was  the situation  one  we did  not say  we would  not take  the kitty  two  we said  that the 
[02:02:30]  kitty  needed  emergency  look at  a vet  three  that was  the end  of it  and we  are not  guilty of  any of  the charges  Jill lies  no one  came out  and saw  the cat  so how  would they  know  what was  wrong  with them  that is  not so  they did  look at  the kitty  and how  could they  say that  the cat  should go  to an  emergency  clinic  if they  didn't  look at  it  because  Jill lies  and you  know that  she has  a reputation 
[02:03:00]  for lying  Jill does  not lie  you want  to call  Jill  this is  all  hearsay  until my  brother  calls in  right  well  this is  hearsay  all I can  tell you  is that  little shelter  is the best  shelter in  the world  I am proud  to be  associated  with it  it is  but you  know what  if you  guys would  help us  we can  become  one of  the biggest  we don't  want to  change  our location  and change  our dynamics  been there  a thousand  years  what we  want to  do  is to  raise  money  we're  stalling  because  we gave  my brother 
[02:03:30]  the wrong  freaking  number  check your  phone  Brett  school  oh there's  Marge  I'm looking  at Marge  on an old  clip of you  from channel  2 news  here in  New York  hey Marge  this is  Brett  hi  Brett  how are  you  well first  of all  thank you  so much  for all  the nice  things you  say about  little shelter  well how come  no one came  out to look  at my kitten  I bring a  blind kitten  and no one  comes out  to look at  it  that is not  what I was  told this  morning  but that's  not true  that's  not true  I sat  out there  in a truck  and nobody  came out 
[02:04:00]  to look at  it  but then  no one  said that  to me  she just  said that  we can't  take the  cat  we're too  busy  and we  got no  time for  you  she said  nicer than  that but  she said  we're too  busy  that's not  little shelter  that's what  she told me  we're never  too busy  to look at  any office  she's in there  she's reading  happy endings  the profiles  of a meaty  breasted  something  of a meaty 
[02:04:30]  breasted  zilch  and she  wouldn't come  out  it was  ridiculous  you know  Brett  I just  was on  the phone  with Jill  during the  break  the guys  break  I was  on the  phone  she told  me  exactly  what  happened  she wasn't  even there  Marge  I know  but she  was  she was  I'm telling  you  I was there  I had a  truck  I pull up  with the  blind kitten  and I'm  telling her  the thing  needs help  it was  mewing  and she  doesn't  do  nothing  and nobody  said to  you that  you should  take the  kitten  to a vet  nobody  looked at 
[02:05:00]  the cat  hey  Marge  how stupid  are you  this isn't  Brett  it's  Jimmy  take that  back  take that  back  that is  so mean  ladies and  gentlemen  my real  brother  Brett Hughes  on with  Marge from  the little  shelter  hey  Marge  what the  hell is  going on  here  Marge  it's  really me  is it  really  prove it  I dropped  off gift  certificates 
[02:05:30]  to your  shelter  yesterday  this is  how nice  my brother  is  they didn't  even take  care of  him  and he  drops  off  freaking  gift  certificates  I would  have  gave him  a boot  to the  twat  Marge  first thing  I gotta  tell you  I appreciate  most of the  work everyone  does down  there  but first  of all  no one  ever ever  even saw  the cat  no one  even came  to the  truck  I had to  run to the  phone so I'm  out of breath  when I  got to  the shelter  my fiance  was asking  for assistance  and I guess 
[02:06:00]  at the time  you guys  were too  busy  it took  about 10  minutes  before anyone  really even  acknowledged us  which maybe  you understand  if I can  understand that  because it  is all  charity work  I actually  roamed the  premises until  I found  the cattery  I went  inside the  cattery  and found  I don't  remember the  woman's name  but I found  a woman who  ran the  cattery I  guess  I explained  to her my  situation  we found  the cat  it's in  bad shape  the eyes  seem to be  you can't  see  they're all  fogged up 
[02:06:30]  and I need  someone to  come look  at it  and right  away the  woman said  you can't  leave the  cat here  we have  no room  I said  ma'am  I have  a kitten  that's in  the truck  and my  fiance  donates  to you  for the  last five  years  monthly  I said  we're getting  married and  instead of giving  out wedding  favors we donated  all the money  we would have  spent on wedding  favors and we  donate to  your shelter  can someone  please just  come to the  truck take a  look at this  kitten to tell  me if it has  a chance or  not and I  was outright  refused and I 
[02:07:00]  was aggravated I  was freaking  pissed and I  even said she  goes we don't  have a medical  center here there's  nothing we can do  I said I'll even  pay for it I  said there's  there's got to be  something that  someone can do  or tell give me  the direction  where to take  this kitten and  I said I'll pay  for all services  I'll do whatever  it takes to make  sure this cat  survives and I  said please just  come to the  truck and take  a look at  them no one  came to the  truck you  helped me with  this kitten my  truck you should  have reenacted 
[02:07:30]  your bathtub scene  from your youth  maybe that would  have gotten  her anyone else  amazed by his  phone call thinking  the same thing I  am that my dad  had some kind of  affair yeah  that's definitely  the opposite of  OB I would like  to I'd like to  say that I can  tell by your  voice that you  are a very  sincere truthful  wonderful guy who  is loving of  animals and I  thank you for the  bottom of my  heart what I 
[02:08:00]  heard was a  completely different  story I have a  meeting at the  shelter today I  will go in and  make sure that I  hear from three or  four different  people exactly what  happened but I  believe what you're  saying Brett are  you only you can  ask three or four  people there's  you know what I  I I there's only  two I apologize I  apologize I'm not  looking for apology  what I'm looking to  do is that this  did you let me ask  you this did you 
[02:08:30]  bring did you bring  the kitten to a  vet ultimately yes  he did and what's  wrong with her you  know Brett I I  heard Brett's phone  crapping out there  he might have lost  we might have lost  Brett oh  all right there he  is Brett he  brought he brought  the kitten to a  vet yes and what  did the vet say  one of the eyes  are going to be  removed and the  other one's being  treated apparently it  was a straight cat  and it was abused  by it was behind  the restaurant in  somewhere an eye  slip ah 
[02:09:00]  eye slip that's  funny get it eye  slip yeah is the  cat being treated  now yes it's at  the vet it yes  it's got to have  its eye taken out  in our care now  but we are we  are currently  treating them  Brett listen I'd  like to talk to  you about helping  you out with the  adoption of the  cat after the cat  is treated is that  okay it's margin the  main focus here  really is what the  situation what went 
[02:09:30]  down at you I  I understand and I  I feel dreadful about  it the cat is not  this is not typical  of what goes on at  little shelter you  have to believe me I  do believe it because  I was here yesterday  again because we made  a promise to your  shelter to donate  like I told you  instead of waiting  for wedding favors  money so we actually  dropped off yesterday  and Arlene who  works there was  unbelievable  you spoke to  Arlene right 
[02:10:00]  yes and she was  unbelievable  I know  Arlene the situation  happened because I  couldn't believe I  gotta be honest I  was a little  perturbed my fiance  brought me back  there Mike you  gotta be kidding me  you know why are we  even going back  there I explained  the situation to  Arlene and Arlene  even said that there  was an on-site  medical staff that  could have taken a  look at him and  when I was at the  front desk the girl  kept calling to the  cattery and no one  picked up so I  actually wandered  into the cattery and  then the front desk  called I actually  was the one who  picked up the phone  so is someone going 
[02:10:30]  to help the gentleman  up front did you say  you were the sausage  king of Chicago  the only thing I  can say to you and  you know I'm talking  over the guys  people are amazed  how kind my brother  is they're just  waiting for the  Ramon it's not  going to happen  Brett I promise  you that I will  look into the  situation even more  deeply I the only  thing I can say is  I'm terribly sorry 
[02:11:00]  stop apologizing  shelter I know the  people at little  shelter are not like  this what happened  that day I'll give  you 24 hours because  I got to make a new  soup tonight so  okay  Brett  bottom line  24 hours or  24 hours or a new  soup gets me on the  menu  I'm so glad you met  Arlene because she is  a typical cat bag  stew  don't order the  meatballs anytime soon  can I have some of
