<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the hosts' characteristically irreverent banter, self-deprecatingly joking about their perceived scumbaggery and the show's negative influence on children.  This segues into a Friday intro featuring their recurring "Chester" bit, involving simulated canine behavior and insults.  They then recount a recent trip to an electronics store, detailing a bizarre encounter with a man named Bob who repeatedly attempted to give Anthony a virus-infected computer, and another incident where Anthony’s attempt at a joke involving a toddler backfired due to baby drool.

A significant portion of the show focuses on a New York Daily News article by Richard Huff about the show's "pests"—listeners who participate in their media stunts.  They discuss the article's humorous tone, listener responses, and their own reactions, briefly referencing previous media coverage including a Time Magazine article.  The hosts also criticize the lack of effective promotion for their show on XM Satellite Radio.  A caller mentions another radio show, Lycus, accused of copying one of their segments.  The segment includes several sexually suggestive jokes, insults, and discussions of listener-created content like Photoshop creations and bumper stickers.  Several callers share their experiences with the show and its fanbase.  Jim Norton is briefly mentioned, and Tom Cruise's engagement is discussed.  Charlie, a staff member, is the only explicitly mentioned in-studio guest.

The show shifts to listener calls and a discussion about divorce, particularly Anthony's experiences.  Callers share their own negative divorce stories, focusing on financial and emotional consequences. Opie details his involvement in Anthony's divorce, describing the stress and anger, including legal battles where Anthony's ex-wife attempted to claim a portion of his radio success.  They also discuss the absurdity and anger-inducing nature of divorce proceedings. A caller recounts a humorous incident with a game warden who, after being called by Christian houseboaters due to the broadcast, asked if he'd "seen any good Hooters lately."  The hosts discuss the show's upcoming availability in Canada on XM, jokingly speculating about potential Canadian content requirements (Neil Young and Rush).  A segment is dedicated to zombie movies, specifically the *Dawn of the Dead* remake, and a Stephen Lynch song about a dysfunctional family is played. Ben Bailey is mentioned as an expected, but late, guest.

A caller shares a story involving his ex-wife's infidelity, his physical violence against her lover, and a contentious divorce.  This leads to a discussion of a news story about a California child molester with an alleged 36,000 victims, prompting speculation about sex tourism in Southeast Asia. A caller's bad cell phone connection interrupts.  Further tangents include the location of the Grand Canyon and the uneventful crash of a Goodyear blimp.

Richard Cheese and his band, Lounge Against the Machine, arrive in studio.  Richard performs songs, including a sexually explicit song where audience participation is initially encouraged then discouraged.  The segment includes discussion of his new album, the inclusion of one of his songs in *Dawn of the Dead*, and his rivalry with Paul Anka. Richard expresses anger at Anka's success and discusses band issues, including a keyboard player who left to join Hilary Duff's band.  An anecdote about a Rikers Island inmate using feces as a weapon is shared. Profanity and offensive language are frequent.

Richard Cheese's performance continues with a song titled "Shit Dick," featuring numerous celebrities and figures (Andy Warhol, Mick Jagger, Michael Jackson, Jeffrey Dahmer, Boy George, Freddy Mercury) interspersed with the repeated phrases "Shoot Nick" and "shit dick."  The hosts praise the song's musicality despite its offensive lyrics.  The conversation shifts to Richard's negative experiences with Oleo Records, including underpayment and contract disputes, particularly regarding significantly lower payment than contractually agreed upon for a second album.  He humorously discusses owning DickCheese.com, linking to both his music site and a pornographic site. Audio clips of Paul Anka yelling at his band are played. A phone call with Richard Huff takes place, discussing the reaction to his article about the show's "pests," including angry emails and letters from listeners.  More music from Richard Cheese concludes the segment.


Finally, the show features more of Richard Cheese and his band as in-studio guests.  The segment begins with a discussion about Adam Sandler's stand-up, followed by Richard Cheese's performance of "People Equal Shit," a song with explicit and aggressive lyrics from their new CD, *Apertif for Destruction*.  Opie and Anthony discuss news stories: a Brooklyn photographer's apology for recreating 9/11 imagery, a 14-year-old who stole and flew a Cessna, and generally rant about those events.  Ugly George and Jim Norton are mentioned as scheduled guests for Monday.  Richard Cheese performs a comedic version of Michael Jackson's "The Girl is Mine," featuring a Stephen Hawking impersonation.  The hosts repeatedly promote Richard Cheese's website and upcoming performance.  Ben Bailey plugs his own show at the Mohegan Sun.

[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  And yeah, we're back.  Where have you been?  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for profit.  Here it comes!  Here it comes!  The Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain. 
[00:04:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back.  I want that back.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with Down  Syndrome children.  No, baby!  That's terrible.  We will be an Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  It's Friday!  Friday!  It's Friday!  Let's do it!  Okay, Tristan.  Chester!  Here, boys.  Come on, Chester!  Chester!  Here, boys.  Come on, Chester!  Chester!  Come on, Chester!  Chester!  Here, boys.  Come on, Chester!  Where's Chester? 
[00:05:00]  Chester!  You're just a tool.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it!  Crawl around like a dog.  You're a kid toucher.  You will keep your hands off of my mule.  You're a filthy whore!  Is that supposed to be sexy?  You are a dog, Chester!  Oh, oh, oh!  Oh!  Oh, oh, oh! 
[00:05:30]  Mom!  Please stop calling!  Mom!  Mom!  I have to do this now!  Mom!  And that's how it begins today.  What the hell?  It's impossible!  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony program.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Happy to be here.  Happy to be here.  Yeah. 
[00:06:00]  Good morning.  It's Friday.  Oh, I say thank God it's Friday.  Sure, why not?  T-G-I-F.  I don't want to.  I want to bang.  Everybody's working for.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Ugh.  No, it's just Friday.  Time for your 5 o'clock traffic jam.  Well, how about the 5 o'clock fuddies? 
[00:06:30]  5 o'clock fuddies.  Oh, the hack voice.  Don't forget we're going to do another Black Party weekend on this fine radio station.  Jack's got to sound so psyched that it's Friday.  It doesn't matter to them.  They don't give a fuck.  They're not working for the week anyway.  They never worked a day in their lives.  Not real work.  We actually work?  Are you kidding me?  Oh, thank God.  It's for a whole.  Boy, my boss is getting on my ass.  What a hump.  Right.  Oh, this job.  Oh, boy.  Right.  I'm just working for the weekend. 
[00:07:00]  Coming there and spin records for four hours.  Ooh.  Whew.  Exhausted.  I'm talking about us.  I just wake up every day hoping that no one discovers that we do nothing.  No one's on to this 10-year scam we've been running.  This 10-year ruse.  It's funny.  When you first start in radio, they do tell you, don't ever mention that it's a job.  I remember Dave Dickless telling us that in a meeting once, a big meeting.  Yeah.  He goes, you know, I listen to you guys, and this is our old program director up in Boston. 
[00:07:30]  I listen to you guys talking, and you say, when I came into work today, or on my way  into work, when I left work today, the listeners don't want to hear that you're working.  They listen to you enjoying yourself and having fun.  It's like, can I tell them about this fucking meeting?  Because this is a real chore.  This is work.  See what you're doing right now?  This makes me, it reminds me, this is my job.  Because my boss is now lecturing me. 
[00:08:00]  I just want you to consider me the third member of the Opie and Anthony program.  The third member of the Opie and Anthony show.  Really?  Yeah, it's just like having Jim Norton.  Jesus.  Don't worry, Dave, we'll figure it out.  Fast forward a few years, and we got our third member.  He stinks, and I don't like him.  And it wasn't you, Dave.  He actually sat down our program director, because Ant and I were so out of control, he felt like  he had to corral us.  Yeah.  He's like, you know, just consider me the third member of the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:08:30]  The Opie and Anthony show.  That's right.  If you have any ideas, you throw them by me.  Yeah.  Stop it.  Slow down.  Anyway.  Love that guy.  I guess we've got to start by thanking everyone that showed up at the appearance yesterday,  at the RCS experience, I guess it's called.  Yeah.  What a cool store, man.  And, you know, we've done appearances at some real shitholes, and then come on the next day  and said, wow, that was a cool place.  But that was really a good place.  That's like, you want electronics?  The place is loaded. 
[00:09:00]  Two floors of really cool stuff.  Digital cameras.  I saw a little laptop.  I swear I was ready to just buy it.  If I had like another ten minutes in the store, I was definitely going to buy it.  It was so tiny.  The thing is like a little, like, how big would you say it is?  I don't even know, like a...  You put two DVD cases together.  Yeah, that's about right.  I was going to say like a little more than two CD cases.  Yeah.  There you go.  Yeah.  And then it has a little docking station that's really small also that has a disk drive on 
[00:09:30]  it, so you can load up your software on it, and then you pop the thing out, and it runs  on Windows, you know?  You open up a browser, and it's not like one of those browsers on a Trio or your phone or  something.  It's a real browser that you can go to any website with.  Very cool.  I'm definitely...  I was looking at it going, yeah, I need a sixth computer.  That's what I need.  I need...  Anthony needs six computers.  How many computers do you have?  I got five.  Seriously, I thought you might be exaggerating.  Wait, hold on. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, wait a minute.  One, two, one, two, three, four, five.  I got five computers.  Are you counting the one in the office that's officially yours?  I got six computers.  I wasn't even thinking of that.  You don't have six computers, do you?  Yes, I do.  I know you have two set up at home, right?  No, I got three at home, two are set up.  One isn't.  Right, that's what I mean.  You have two set up that you can use at any given moment.  Desktops.  Right.  And then I got two laptops.  Right.  In the bedroom.  And then, yeah, one that's home that isn't set up. 
[00:10:30]  And then one here at work.  Yeah.  Okay.  I have six computers.  Well, that guy Bob...  I need seven.  That guy Bob wanted to give you a virus computer.  Bob was a...  What a lunatic.  Yeah, I said I needed...  There's guys like Bob that ruin it for everybody else.  They just ruin everything.  Bob is the reason Club Soda Kenny ushers you on if you say more than five words to us.  No.  Because you might be Bob.  We don't mind people talking to us.  I know, but...  Bob did not want to leave.  That's what I mean. 
[00:11:00]  Bob needed to give you a virus computer, he said.  Yeah, because we had talked on the air about the AIDS computer.  I need a computer.  There's Bob.  There's a picture of Bob up on Foundry.  Yeah, we got pictures from our appearance on opianthony.com.  Standing with the biggest celebrity that was there yesterday.  Pat from Munaki.  Pat from Munaki.  It wasn't the Opian Anthony show.  It was Pat from Munaki.  Who was just waiting in line to get an autograph.  I'm like, Pat, weren't you just in the studio a couple days ago?  What are you doing?  Well, I got this.  He's taking pictures with people, signing autographs. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, so Bob comes up and says he wants to give me...  And I couldn't understand him at first.  He said he wants to give me an AIDS computer.  And I thought he said he wanted to give me AIDS.  And he walks up to me and goes to shake my hand.  Right, right.  And I just pulled away and went, ah!  Like I was disgusted.  He goes, oh, you want to shake my hand?  And I go, I don't shake any hands.  Get away from me.  And then he's just rambling on.  Because I need a computer that isn't hooked up to the network.  And I'm not afraid of it getting a virus. 
[00:12:00]  It's called the AIDS computer.  So I could download things from Kazaa and not worry about infecting my other computers.  So he wanted to give me one because he drives around and looks for junk computers that are left out on the curb.  This is what this guy does.  Yeah.  And picks them up.  And then, you know, trades pieces until he gets one to work.  Yeah, but he also is talking about how he likes to go into these people's computers.  Exactly.  To see what they have in there.  He gets passwords, bank account numbers, all kinds of things that people leave on their computers. 
[00:12:30]  And, yeah, he said he wants to send movies.  He's got, like, shit videos and all kinds of fun stuff.  So he wouldn't shut up.  He kept yapping and yapping.  And Club Soda Kenny starts going, okay, move along.  You're done, sir.  And he would move kind of to the side so other people can come in front.  But he was still talking.  So I'm just, and then I'm trying to talk to other people because other people are coming up and they have things to say. 
[00:13:00]  But Bob is occupying all my time.  And I'm just going, yeah, yeah, cool, cool.  And then I'm talking to somebody else.  Someone goes, hey, how you doing, man?  Like, hey, good.  And Bob is still yapping in my ear.  And the best part, we're all a bunch of scumbags because we finally get Bob out of your hair.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden he's like, now, he's away from the scene.  Crossed the store.  And, of course, now we're all taking turns going, Bob, Anthony has one more thing to ask you.  And he comes walking right back.  And it took a good ten minutes to get him out of the area. 
[00:13:30]  Bob.  Bob.  Bob.  So he came back.  Yeah.  But it was exciting.  I want to thank everyone that stopped by and said hi.  It's really cool.  This thing is starting to grow again.  This thing is starting to take on a life of its own.  We're all feeling it around here.  You could tell.  It's really, really cool.  Because we thought we would never do radio again.  There was a point Anthony and I thought we were completely finished.  And it's just cool to see this thing just growing like a virus slowly but surely every day. 
[00:14:00]  Thought we were done in the business.  Done in the business.  That little kid.  That was a cute little kid.  Well, Anthony has a picture up on foundrymusic.com of him choking a little kid.  I was tussling the virus.  Look, I'm choking him in that picture.  Let me see that.  I haven't seen that one.  You haven't seen it?  I've got to go to foundry and check it out.  Yeah.  I was choking him as a joke.  Well, this guy, he put his little lad up on the table.  And Anthony thought it would be cute to choke him in front of everybody.  Choke him out.  While the kid's drinking out of his Bob. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, let me tell you something.  First, the guy comes up and says, Anthony, I want you to hold my kid while I take a picture.  And I go, I don't hold children.  This ain't going to happen, Pally.  I don't hold kids.  So he goes, all right, what if I put...  God, you just make it sound like it's a great thing to go out there and go to one of our appearances.  I don't shake hands.  I know.  I shook hands.  I didn't shake Bob's hand because he said he wanted to give me AIDS.  But, no, I don't hold kids. 
[00:15:00]  So I said, I don't hold babies.  I don't hold kids.  I don't shake hands.  And that's more of a, you know, I don't want to be sued if I, you know, drop the kid, kick him, fondle him.  You know, so he decided to take the kid out of the little stroller.  How old would you say that kid is?  He's a little over a year, maybe.  He's like a little over a year old.  And put him up on the desk we were using to sign stuff.  And he sits him up there.  So he's a cute little kid.  And so I tussled his hair. 
[00:15:30]  And they took a picture of me tussling his hair.  And I thought it would be funny to put my hands around his neck and choke him.  And then he took some pictures of that.  And it backfired on me.  Because after I did it, my hand was covered in kid slime.  Because he was drinking out of his little sippy cup.  And he was drooling.  So all down his chin and neck where I was choking him, he had drool.  And it was all over my hands.  I had baby drool on my hands.  I was freaking out, but I couldn't leave.  I was going to say, that could be your worst nightmare right there. 
[00:16:00]  Dude, if it was snot, I'd have left.  You would have been on your own.  I understand that.  I didn't look or nothing.  Man, that's funny.  I got to punch it here.  I am choking the kid.  That's a great picture.  Maybe I should run for a public office.  There you have it.  Well, you know what?  It was a lot of fun.  I want to thank everyone once again for coming out.  You're just looking at me laughing.  I'm laughing hysterically.  Because I know that this will be up on a website. 
[00:16:30]  And people are going to be horrified when they see it.  What we're going to do, too, because Charlie and the gang over there, they're really cool.  They have this second floor studio that overlooks Madison Avenue.  We're going to broadcast from there, I think.  Nice.  We'll do a day or two from there.  That'd be cool.  They're going to work out the details, and we'll do it.  Kind of like MTV style, where you're like TRL.  Like a little TRL.  Yeah, we'll get chicks out there with signs.  I was going to say TRL without the hotness. 
[00:17:00]  And without the hip factor.  With no hotness.  With no hotness whatsoever.  So, all right.  Moving on, Anthony.  Moving on.  I want to congratulate the pests of this fine program.  You made the paper again.  Pests are making news like Tom Cruise.  You're in the paper all the time now, the pests.  Well, Tom Cruise is now officially engaged.  Tom Cruise is officially engaged.  Beard. 
[00:17:30]  Homo.  Beard.  Fake.  He likes to suck on the men's cocks.  What, too much?  I don't know what the hell's going on there.  Yeah.  I think he just wants kids.  I think that's what it is.  I think he wants kids of his own.  I think.  He's got kids, but they're all, you know.  Mark my word.  Katie Holmes will be pregnant by the end of the summer.  Foul that body.  I'm not even saying the end of the year.  End of the summer.  What if she is already pregnant and they've done this quick, rapid fire, love fest engagement 
[00:18:00]  to, you know, cover it up.  Make it seem like they went through all the motions the way they were supposed to.  Dirk had a good line.  He's like, can you imagine, you know, Tom Cruise with a turkey baster trying to get her pregnant?  Oh, shoving some up there because he's repulsed by her delicious, beautiful vagina.  Hey, we're just saying.  We have no idea.  Tom Cruise with a turkey baster.  We don't want to be like Imus and have to apologize to the Tom Cruise camp, so we really 
[00:18:30]  have no idea what Tom's about, but it's our feeling that there could be something going  on there.  Something going on.  He's got her hypnotized with that Scientology.  Yeah, well, what they met only six weeks ago, something like that?  It was a few weeks ago.  A few weeks ago, and now they're already engaged?  He proposed to our Opi, how romantic, on the Eiffel Tower in Paris.  How original.  Suck it!  How original.  How original, right?  Why don't you just go to a baseball game, you ass? 
[00:19:00]  I say you'd be real romantic.  Buy the ring at a jewelry store in Penn Station.  Drive your Volkswagen Bug with no heat up to Boston, Massachusetts in the freezing cold.  Yeah, he's just like you.  Get drunk.  He's just like you.  Get drunk because you know it's a bad idea when your life stinks so bad that you realize  this is as good as it gets.  Change is change.  Might as well.  Maybe something will come of it.  You've got to roll the dice sometimes. 
[00:19:30]  Maybe a miracle will occur.  Yeah.  But there you have it.  Tom Cruise, the big news today.  Engaged to that hot piece of ass Katie Holmes.  Yeah, he's going to wreck her.  All right.  So, yeah, the pests of this fine program made the paper again.  And this is what we call, that's why we love the term spread the virus because it's just  these things that happen that are getting the name out there slowly but surely and more  people are finding out about the show and then they're telling their friends and they're 
[00:20:00]  spreading it to this person and that person.  And these are viral symptoms that pop up, things like these news stories, the attack on the  media, all the little peripheral things from the show, the symptoms of the virus, which  I love.  How about this?  There was a guy, he hung up or the phones were going wacky.  I'm not sure what's going on yet.  It's okay?  Okay.  A guy said, I just want to let you guys know, was a huge fan of yours.  He lives in Jersey.  So, it's not like an old fan that, you know, ended up living in the middle of nowhere. 
[00:20:30]  Still lives in Jersey.  Found out that we're back on the air only two days ago.  Yeah.  Two days ago.  Two days ago.  He's had XM.  No, that's another guy I was going to get to.  Oh, that guy.  This is just a guy that just called that I couldn't get to in time.  Dude, how about the guy we met?  Big fan of the show.  Yesterday.  Listened to us.  At NEW.  Loved the show.  And then we went away.  He wound up getting XM.  He's had XM for a year.  For a year.  And he just stumbled upon us two weeks ago. 
[00:21:00]  Two weeks ago.  And he was a hardcore fan.  Yeah.  Hardcore.  Yeah, he would have subscribed to us anything.  And he didn't know.  He just didn't know.  So, the marketing department down there in Washington think they have done their jobs?  No.  Not even close.  You still have a lot of work ahead of you.  Are we being promoted on other channels?  Yeah, here and there.  Yeah.  Here and there.  Sure.  I'm not bitching about it because I don't know.  I'm not sure.  Here and there.  But I haven't heard us.  The thing is, the most listened to channels are the ones I listen to. 
[00:21:30]  I listen to the ridiculous 80s.  I listen to Top Tracks, Ethel, things like that.  And I listen to them a lot.  What about the Comedy Channel?  That's a perfect tie-in for this program and we're barely mentioned on there.  There's so much more that XM can do.  I never heard us promoted on any of those channels, though.  I haven't heard us on...  Unless one of the jocks decides to mention us, which is cool, on the 80s channel.  What's her name?  God, we've got to figure out what her name is.  Is it Heidi?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's really cool.  On the 80s channel? 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  I've heard her mention the show.  Mm-hmm.  The dudes on Squiz like us.  Yeah.  Comedy Channel?  Eh.  I don't know.  But, like, the most listened to channels ought to have promos for our show.  They don't have to be filthy dirty.  It's just, you know, to get people that know who we are and enjoy the show but just don't  know we're here.  Stuff like that.  You know?  Fox News Channel.  How about you during a break?  You pop us in there.  Just Opie and Anthony.  Channel 202.  People go, oh, Opie and Anthony?  Right.  I remember those guys. 
[00:22:30]  All right.  Well, here's the latest article on the Opie and Anthony show, Anthony.  Once again, in the New York Daily News, in Tube Talk.  Right.  To the people that are just finding us within the last week or two, just to help you along  here, this guy Richard Huff did a huge article on us.  I believe, what, last Friday, was it?  Yeah.  We love Richard Huff.  I've got to tell you, I love this guy.  We had him on the air.  We had a lot of fun with him.  And you know what?  But this article proves that this guy has a huge sense of humor.  Very funny. 
[00:23:00]  He just makes fun of himself throughout the whole damn thing.  You know what was really interesting?  Listening to the replay when we had him on the air the first time.  We bashed him at the beginning of the show.  Then we had him on the phone and found out what he was all about.  He was funny.  And we like him.  Then you go home and listen to the replay again.  And it was making me cringe how badly we were bashing the shit out of him in the morning. 
[00:23:30]  And it had to play all day long.  Oh.  Even after we had spoken.  Oh, you mean before we got him on the air.  Before we got him on the air.  So after we got to know him and stuff, then it goes back to the replay of the morning of us just, you know.  Right.  On a dick breath.  It was really bad.  This asshole.  Well, that's what we do.  Richard Huff, you asshole.  We're just being all nasty.  But that's how easy it is to turn us around, too.  Of course.  We hate you in the morning by the end of the show.  We love you.  We're saps.  Two hours later, we're kissing his ass.  So just to go back, I guess, a week, he did a whole article on the pests that do the assaults on the media. 
[00:24:00]  Mm-hmm.  All right?  And he had a couple examples, and he said how it's very disruptive and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Did his editorial.  And then we got him on the air, talked to him and stuff.  And our pests, you can't even call them listeners anymore.  No.  They are just pests.  Our pests.  They wrote this guy, emailed him like crazy.  Yeah, a couple.  I guess he got a couple of emails. 
[00:24:30]  These pests.  They certainly know how to respond.  So Richard Huff decided, well, this is too good.  So he decided to write another whole-page article on us.  The complete tube talk, which is just a huge section of the Daily News.  And it's just going to really help spread the virus of this show.  It's a full-page.  It's like a full-page ad.  Once again, it has our names.  It has XM Satellite Radio.  Huge picture.  Huge pictures.  So there you have it.  I want to read this whole thing because it's great. 
[00:25:00]  Is this an article online for everyone else around the country?  Yes.  All right.  You can go to opianthony.com and foundrymusic.com to see it for yourself.  But very, very funny.  The headline, ONA fans send pest regards.  Pest regards.  Very funny.  So he's even using the word pest and pests.  I've got to tell you, I was talking to my brother the other day.  Yeah.  My brother Darren.  He's coming up with an official pest t-shirt with the new Opie and Anthony logo on the front. 
[00:25:30]  And you know how you see shirts that just say staff on the back?  Uh-huh.  This one's just going to say pest.  Pest.  So Opie and Anthony logo on the front, pest on the back.  And then he's working on this cartoon character of a mosquito that's just really just annoying.  A nasty mosquito.  Just a nasty mosquito.  Because that's what the pests are like.  Like your ear at night in the summer?  Are you trying to go to sleep? 
[00:26:00]  They just never go away?  It sounds like it's going to be a good t-shirt.  So he's working on it.  He'll unveil the design soon.  And then you could get your official Opie and Anthony pest t-shirt.  A hawk in our wares.  Why not?  All right.  So it's the Daily News.  ONA fans send pest regards.  It's our good pal Richard Huff.  And hopefully he'll come on the show once again today.  Sure.  I like this guy.  Memo to self it starts out, Anthony.  Don't pick on Opie and Anthony listeners. 
[00:26:30]  Ah.  Bravo that you're learning that lesson early on.  Because others have not learned that lesson yet.  No.  No surprise last week after I slammed the ONA fans who disrupted newscasts by holding up signs behind correspondence.  The emails started coming in.  Okay.  So I called some of them psychopaths, idiots, and jerks.  But after talking to Opie and Anthony on their XM radio show,  I learned that they actually have a name for their fans.  Pests.  That's right.  Don't you realize when you write about this shit, it's just going to get worse? 
[00:27:00]  Wrote one pest who did not give a name.  You can't be that fucking stupid to think your article is worth the paper it's printed on.  Actually, and this is Richard Huff now talking again.  Actually, I believe the column is worth the full 50 cents cover price of the Daily News.  Not a penny more, not a penny less.  And then it goes back to some of the pest comments.  Maybe if you stopped talking about it and others did the same,  they would see that their efforts are a waste of time, wrote Kurt Briscar. 
[00:27:30]  Well, I guess that's not a pest.  That's someone that just flat out hates us.  I would say anyone that's giving their name is not a pest.  Pests are nameless.  Yeah, pests don't need to get their names out in general.  Nameless pests.  Then Richard says again here, true, but then I'd have nothing to write about.  Let's see.  I normally agree with you, but not today, my good friend, wrote Dan Andrews.  The Open Anthony fans have every right to turn the table on the media. 
[00:28:00]  It's the media that exploits crimes and people into profit.  If someone can beat the media at their own game, then God bless them.  Mr. Huff, your articles always make me think.  Gary Rushnick wrote, who is really being hurt by this?  Yeah, it's annoying for reporters, but when is a reporter not annoying?  When they are chasing average Joes down for interviews when something happens?  When they are outside the house of a newsworthy person demanding interviews?  The difference is that average Joes don't have to speak to the media while a correspondent has no recourse when a pest stands behind him shouting and holding signs, Richard Huff says. 
[00:28:30]  In fairness to O&A, instructions for the assault on the media campaign say don't jump in front of the correspondent, don't swear, and don't pick fights.  Just be a pest because so many of you are so good at just that.  It's written on their website.  I am 100% in your corner on the O&A thing, wrote Mitch Beck, who said he was on the radio for 25 years, Anthony.  25-year veteran of the business. 
[00:29:00]  Mitch Beck.  Someone look up what Mitch Beck did in his radio career.  I have no idea who this guy is, and I pretty much know all the players.  I'm 100% in your corner on the O&A thing, wrote Mitch Beck, who said he was on the radio for 25 years.  If I were a program director, I would fire someone just for suggesting this kind of crap.  Hence the reason, Mitch, that you never did anything of value in this business.  It's not funny, it's not interesting, and it's extremely rude, and has no other point than to be rude and to promote O&A. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, we admitted that.  Yeah.  We admitted that exact point, Mitch.  That's it.  No news there.  That was my point, too, but Beck and I were with the minority on this issue, at least among those who wrote, Richard Huff says.  You didn't even allow me time to get mad at you this morning, wrote Chris Orlando, as by the time I finished your article on O&A,  you were already on the air with the boys explaining yourself, and I was right there laughing along.  And then there were the pure attacks, many of whom did not respond to requests for their names. 
[00:30:00]  And Richard Huff has a few of these listed.  Yeah.  You're an ass, wrote one.  You, sir, are a balding tool, wrote another.  Who wrote that one?  You, sir, are a balding tool, wrote another.  And then another guy writes, shut up, write about something important, wrote Anthony Scarpelli,  who said he pulled one of the O&A stunts in Boston. 
[00:30:30]  Oh.  Wow, just wow, wrote a female pest who did not respond to a request for her full name.  You can see Richard, he's just getting abused, writing them back, trying to get their names and stuff.  Trying to get their names, I want to use your name in an article, please respond.  And they respond by going, oh, go fuck yourself.  Because a lot of them probably, their return email address is, you're a balding tool at yahoo.com.  Wow, just wow, wrote a female pest who did not respond to a request for her full name.  I've seen 12-year-olds compose a better article. 
[00:31:00]  It's choppy and flows as well as Crisco through an artery.  You should consider looking into a new career.  For the record, this is not the first time I've been told to find a new career.  Some of my colleagues suggest that often.  Also, Connie Chung yelled the same thing at me in 1995 when she was extremely unhappy with something I wrote.  Really?  Yeah.  I want to ask him about his little battle with Connie Chung.  Yeah, we're going to try to get him back on the air, hopefully later on this morning.  I didn't take the advice then.  I'm not taking it now. 
[00:31:30]  You can email rhoff at nydailynews.com.  Give him props.  We like the guy.  Definitely.  Is that the guy?  Yeah, this is Mitch Beck.  Mitch Beck.  20 years in front of an audience as both a radio personality and as a stand-up comedian.  God, he fell to two professions.  Mitch has also been very successful over his 10-plus years of experience as an executive recruiter. 
[00:32:00]  Well, nothing says funny like executive recruiter.  Countless times as a performer, Mitch has successfully interviewed.  Executive recruiter?  What the hell is an executive recruiter?  That's somebody that gets people, the right person for the right job.  He's a headhunter?  Right.  Yeah.  Oy.  Successfully interviewed, been interviewed, and has auditioned for individuals and to small and large groups.  The hell does that mean?  I have no idea. 
[00:32:30]  He has first-hand knowledge of what does and does not work, and more importantly, he's sympathetic to understanding how stressful those situations can be.  This is bullshit.  This is fill up the space with words bullshit.  This obviously is a friend of Richard Huff.  Out of all the radio guys that he could have contacted for a comment on this whole thing, he finds this zero.  Mitch Beck?  Mitch Beck had a problem?  What was Mitch Beck's quote?  Mitch Beck said, I'm 100% in your corner on the Oney thing, wrote Mitch Beck, who said he was on the radio for 25 years. 
[00:33:00]  If I were a program director, I would fire someone just for suggesting this kind of crap.  It's not funny, it's not interesting, and it's extremely rude, and has no other point than to be rude and to promote O&A.  Mitch doesn't understand being in radio for that many years and being a stand-up comedian.  He doesn't understand the value in getting your name and exposure like this.  He doesn't see that, and he has all this first-hand knowledge of what does and does not work. 
[00:33:30]  Read on.  It means this is nonsense.  Mitch has learned how to overcome them, stressful situations, I guess, and will share his insight and experiences with you so that you can overcome the challenges that face you in this tight job market.  Over the past five years, Mitch Beck and his staff at Crossroads Consulting, there you go, have seen thousands of resumes and hundreds of people coming through its doors.  And we have learned that resumes draw the attention of hiring managers and those that do not. 
[00:34:00]  We have seen the various ways that people approach interviews and blah, blah.  This guy prepares you for an interview?  Yeah, he prepares you for a job interview.  That's just as rewarding as being successful in radio or stand-up comedy.  And you live at 365 Ben Bailey Boulevard?  I love that.  Ben Bailey's coming in today.  If you think this process is difficult to you, it doesn't have to be anymore. 
[00:34:30]  We will help.  Don't let past difficulties hinder your future.  Call Mitch Beck at 203...  I won't do that.  459.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Let's go to line...  I'm sure it's easy to find.  I think I'm going to go to line two, and then I'm going to go to line eight.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  And then...  I think a little vindication is needed on the part of...  for XM executives and the Fox News things. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  We'll get it.  Gary in Indianapolis.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  Just wanted to let you know I got the virus.  Oh, cool, man.  But I was letting you know that whenever I activated my Roadie 2, you were on Premium Channel,  and the people that are doing the activation, they compare you guys to Stern, and I refuse  to pay because I don't want to listen to that shit.  Yeah, that's just a bunch of dummies that don't really know how to define the program. 
[00:35:30]  It's so easy just to call us shock jocks or compare us to Howard Stern.  That's just stupid.  It's hard to...  It's stupid marketing.  To defend them a little bit, it is hard to describe this mess, isn't it?  Yeah, but just to simply...  What would you say?  Just to simply say, it's like Howard Stern or it's shock jocks.  That shit drives me nuts.  That's people that are lazy not doing their homework and really trying to figure out what  the show is about that is unique and different from all the radio shows.  That's right.  And I've started spreading the virus here in Indianapolis, and we're taking over... 
[00:36:00]  We're going to wind up taking over the other two guys here locally.  Bob and Tom?  Yeah.  Bob and Tom have done nothing with their careers.  I couldn't have told you it was them that were up there.  Well, I told you.  I know all the players in this business.  Bob and Tom are guys that do very well in very small markets.  They never made it in the big leagues.  No, you're right.  They've got it in a lot of...  They're the kings of minor league radio.  Great.  They're not even AAA ball.  They're like the kings of AA ball. 
[00:36:30]  Congratulations to you.  Well, I'm the kings of commercials.  I don't know.  I mean, I've never really heard Bob and Tom.  I think I heard them once when I was driving somewhere in the middle of California.  Speaking of commercial radio, quickly, driving home yesterday, there was a lot of traffic  because we left kind of late.  So I'm in the Midtown Tunnel for quite an extended period of time with the traffic.  So my XM wasn't coming in, in the tunnel.  They've got to get repeaters in those tunnels.  I mean, you know, you pick them.  It's a major city, New York. 
[00:37:00]  I figure out putting a repeater in the goddamn tunnel.  So I switch over to regular radio, and I put on Jack, you know, the CBS FM thing.  And everyone's talking about Jack.  And everyone's talking about Jack.  Yeah, yeah.  Dude.  The longest commercial break where I finally, and I'm stuck in rush hour, New York City,  tunnel traffic.  Finally, I don't know how long it was, but it was quite some time later.  I pop out the other end, never heard one song.  I did not hear one song.  I was able to then go right back to XM, and that was my Jack experience yesterday. 
[00:37:30]  That was my Jack experience yesterday.  Yeah, I was jacking yesterday in the tunnel.  That was it.  Commercial break the entire time I'm stuck in the tunnel.  Yeah.  How is regular radio even thinking they're going to just skip along, not acknowledging  satellite radio, when they're just pounding you with these commercial breaks that go on  and on?  A brand new station with a brand new format.  Wouldn't you at least for some time go, not even commercial free, but with really limited 
[00:38:00]  commercial breaks?  No.  Nothing.  They were stacked up where I didn't hear one song.  So if I was into the Jack format, I would find out their playlist, get all those songs  on my iPod, right?  Yeah.  And then, you know, if you want to go that way, if you don't have the satellite radio,  then, you know, listen to your iPod in your car.  There you go.  And then you don't have to deal with the commercials.  Believe me, they're not rotating that many songs around on the Jack format.  You could load them all up in an iPod.  Because why would you listen to the station? 
[00:38:30]  Because the jocks are going to say something witty?  I hear they're pretty much jockless.  They are jockless.  So they're jockless with too many commercials.  So just get the music they play, throw it on your iPod, and just listen to your iPod  in your car.  It's an iPod with commercials.  Right.  Exactly.  That's what Jack is.  Great.  How stupid is that?  Let's go to John in Jersey.  John, what's up?  Hey, what's happening?  Hey.  Underneath my WOW sticker, I had a friend of mine make a magnetic bumper sign.  It's the same size as a bumper sticker.  Yeah.  And it says, tune in to 88.1 FM to listen to Opie and Anthony. 
[00:39:00]  Stay close.  Enjoy.  Since I've had it on, like three weeks, I've had people pull up to my driveway saying that  they didn't know you were on.  People pull over at the parking lots with me and tell me that they never knew you were  on.  I'm a little nervous.  Sorry.  That's okay.  That's pretty cool because the little transmitter that transmits from your XM unit to your own  radio, it does have like a broadcast radius that goes out a little bit.  So if you tune your car radio as you're next to this guy to the proper station, you're going 
[00:39:30]  to hear his XM radio on your radio.  Right.  And he's advertising it like that.  That's pretty cool, man.  Thanks.  You know how I found that out?  Can I tell you real quick?  You guys were on vacation and I just pulled up to a Dunkin' Donuts and I was literally  like three feet from the window.  There were two women in there in like tennis outfits.  Yeah.  And I see one of them put her hands over her mouth.  Another one is like just put a cup in her cheeks.  I go walking in and I can see this little four foot like Hindu lady trying to jump up  at the radio.  Yeah. 
[00:40:00]  It was Bob Kelly describing how he was fucking a sink coming over.  That's how I knew that it was transmitting elsewhere.  Ah, that's great.  So, all right guys, I'm punching out.  Holy gee, that is funny.  I love hearing the stories of how the old listeners, you know, found out that we were back.  Like, they're always, you know, fun stories to listen to.  Really fun.  Let's go to Albert in Texas.  Albert.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How are you guys doing, man?  Pretty good. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, well, I wanted to let you know a couple of things.  One, I don't know if they're ripping you off, but somebody in California does Flash Fridays.  I don't know if you guys ever heard of that.  Oh.  Yeah, it's Lycus.  I'm lick-ass.  And Lycus knows he got the bit from us.  I can tell you the day he decided to do that bit.  It was when we were all broadcasting.  Tell him, Eric.  It was when we were all broadcasting live from Turks and Caicos, and we were doing it  down there.  And then all of a sudden, like, literally a couple weeks later, he was doing it on his  show when he went back to L.A.  He knows.  Remember the Turks and Caicos? 
[00:41:00]  There was a bunch of stations.  And we were all hanging out, like, just about on the beach under this big broadcast tent.  It was the Sam Adams broadcast.  Yes, Sam Adams.  Went down there with Sam Adams.  So we're all, like, drinking Sam and hanging out.  And there were other jocks there that were pretty cool that we were laughing with and  stuff and doing their show, and they would come on our show, and we'd goof off.  Tom Likas was the only jock out of all the jocks that were there that stayed in his room.  He had wires running from the broadcast tent. 
[00:41:30]  And believe me, they broadcast from Turks and Caicos.  They, like, flew NASA in to get uplink satellite dishes there and everything.  So it was a big pain in the ass to get this broadcast tent hooked up and ready for all  these people to broadcast from.  Tom Likas made them run extra cables away from the broadcast tent into his room.  So you saw these cables running across the beach and grass by the hotel.  Under the palm trees.  Under the palm trees.  Under the door.  Right.  Into his hotel room.  Right by girls in tiny little bikinis with their little drinks. 
[00:42:00]  And he would broadcast from there.  Actually, topless girls, because there's Turks and Caicos.  He would broadcast from inside his room.  You're in paradise.  With the shades down.  It's like, why are you even broadcasting from here?  Why show up?  Why show up there?  You might as well have stayed home, you ask.  Yeah.  Because you know why?  He really didn't have any way of conveying to his listeners the beach and the fun.  He's a one-trick pony.  He doesn't have that.  So he might as well just be in a box somewhere doing what he does. 
[00:42:30]  And wow, it took over that whole Club Med.  Yeah.  When we were broadcasting.  We had the stickers.  Everywhere are the signs.  And next thing you know, he goes back to L.A.  And a week or two later, he starts his own version.  Flash Friday.  He knows.  I'm like it.  He knows.  Kurt in Cleveland.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  You know what, dude?  Richard Hoff.  You know, I sent that guy a lengthy, lengthy email.  Pretty much slamming him in support of you.  Yeah.  And he's so hurting for news that he has to pull one little thing I wrote out of that article  and slap it in his article today, making it sound like I'm in support of him. 
[00:43:00]  What did you say?  Which one was yours?  I wrote, maybe if you stop talking about it, the others did the same.  Oh, that Kurt.  Oh, you're that Kurt.  You're famous.  You're that Kurt.  Wow.  You're famous.  Dude.  Kurt Bob Briscar.  Yeah, but the thing is.  Here's your quote.  Maybe if you stop talking about it and others did the same, they would see that their efforts  are a waste of time.  And it sounds to me now, reading that, like you are against the show and you think no  one should talk about it, so.  Right.  And that's what's driving me nuts.  It's like, you know, he gets all this hate mail and he gets all these people hating him 
[00:43:30]  and obviously he had nothing really in support of him, so he had to go through all the hate  mail he got and find one little blurb out of there that was really meant to make him look  like an asshole, saying, dude, if you have to find news that bad that you have to go  and report on something like this, all you're really doing is giving Opie and Anthony what  they want.  Hey, Kurt, welcome to our nightmare, okay? 
[00:44:00]  Welcome to our world where you say something to the press and it completely gets twisted  around into something else.  Isn't it fun?  It's worse than a marriage.  Well, listen, this is a perfect example today.  You know, we get this huge feature in the Daily News once again and Anthony and I are  very happy today, trust me, very happy.  We love the news.  This completely helps the whole spread the virus thing.  But Richard Huff and the article, very entertaining, very funny in general.  It is funny.  But it's kind of sad because Richard Huff was on this program.  We had a lot of fun. 
[00:44:30]  We had some intelligent conversation about the whole thing as well.  Talking about TV shows, what he does, you know, talking about TV shows.  And we discussed some of the new shows that are out, things like that.  And discussed our point of view as far as this whole assault on the media goes.  And he doesn't even mention any of that, unfortunately.  You know, what's even worse is that, like you guys said, I finally get my name in the  paper.  But if I show it to anybody I know, they're going to say, dude, you're a dick.  You don't like going A?  Yeah, I know.  Isn't it fun?  You love the press, don't you?  Yeah.  Well, hey, man.  Keep it up.  You guys rock.  Thanks, man.  The times I had explained, well, that's not really how it went down at St. Pat's Cathedral. 
[00:45:00]  How many times did I have to go?  A million times.  I didn't say it like that.  It wasn't that.  That's not really how it went down.  You know, this is how it really went down.  But the press didn't bother, you know, doing their fact-checking.  Dude, nothing beats my Time Magazine quote.  Yeah, yeah.  I was, me and Opie in Time Magazine.  Time friggin' Magazine.  Finally a magazine we can bring home to our parents.  I was so, when I heard we were doing an interview in Time Magazine and the writer comes over 
[00:45:30]  and does the interview with us and I was so psyched, I'm telling my family, we're going  to be in Time Magazine.  It's different, you know, than being in Hustler and other porno magazines or, you know, little  publication here in the magazine.  I mean, yeah.  It's a little different.  Even things like Maxim and stuff, it's very cool to be in, but when you're in Time, you  know, that's something your parents can understand.  FHM Magazine, actually.  Yeah, FHM.  But when you're in Time, that's something your parents understand. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, Time Magazine, you know?  The president's on the cover.  Of course, it's Time.  I was very excited about it.  And we did a lengthy interview with the guy.  The guy's a douche.  The guy is, he's always on those VH1 shows, too.  Right.  On those VH1 80s countdown shows and stuff.  Another guy that had an agenda.  Yeah.  I forget his name.  That's the article right there?  No, that's the, that's, we were in Time Magazine again after we got fired.  Oh, right.  After we got fired.  Headline, Opie, we hardly knew ye. 
[00:46:30]  Like, this guy just did not like Anthony.  No.  Notice he leaves your name out of the headline.  Opie, we hardly knew ye.  He knows it's the Opie and Anthony show.  Tool.  But for some reason, he was, remember, we asked him why you weren't quoted more in the article.  He goes, uh, because Anthony just didn't say anything funny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because Anthony's not a funny guy.  Or the guy.  Even interesting.  Yeah.  The guy obviously was a tool and had some kind of agenda.  Joel Stein.  That's right.  Joel Stein.  Yeah.  Anyway.  Stupid Joel Stein.  Go ahead.  So, yeah, I'm very excited about that. 
[00:47:00]  Well, the article comes out, and I have one quote in it, and we were talking about our  history, how we hooked up, doing the show, what it's like doing, I mean, everything, every  aspect of the show was discussed with this guy.  Then at one point during the interview, he noticed there was a Mary Kate and Ashley poster  up on the wall.  Right.  And he goes, what's that all about?  I go, oh, the Olsen twins.  We have the countdown going for when they turn 18, and I pointed to the poster and said 
[00:47:30]  something like, Ashley's the goer, and Mary Kate's the prude, and Ashley's the goer.  Priss.  The priss.  Something like that, yeah.  I don't remember the exact quote.  Right.  And that's what he quoted.  That's what he quoted.  That was the only quote you got.  That was the only quote I got.  It was a magazine article.  Mary Kate is a priss, and Ashley's the goer.  So now my family's like, oh, Time Magazine, oh, let's read, oh, good. 
[00:48:00]  And we said some great things.  You know, the one thing, we're fortunate enough to do a lot of interviews with magazines and  stuff, we usually know the publication very well.  So if it's like Penthouse, we understand what kind of article they're looking for, or Hustler,  the Hustler article that came out recently.  We understand what they're going for.  Time Magazine, we're thinking, well, we better go a little more highbrow on this one.  So we did.  We discussed some things in a very intelligent fashion, but that guy didn't want anything 
[00:48:30]  to do with that.  Mary Kate and Ashley, before they were 18, so my family's like, great.  Yeah, it was the pedophile joke.  Yeah.  All right, let's get back to the...  Oh, I saw that guy.  I know who that is.  All right, we'll go to him in a second.  Mark in Oklahoma City.  Mark, make it fast.  Okay.  Hey, boy, it's going to make that 200-mile trip down to see Jimmy tonight.  Oh, that's right.  He's at the Addison Improv in Dallas all weekend long.  Yep.  All right, guys.  Hey, Anthony, have you seen the flash animation on the Photoshop of you from Houdini on Wack 
[00:49:00]  Bag?  Is that the fire extinguisher one?  No, it's you and Pat from Munaki in the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.  Oh, shit, I've got to check that one out.  That is fucking hilarious.  They are doing some great flash animation and animated GIFs, and it's amazing what they're  doing.  They did one where they...  Remember the bad fire extinguisher picture I had up in Boston of me squirting the fire  extinguisher?  They took that, put a picture of you laying in a bed, and me coming up behind you, shoving 
[00:49:30]  the fire extinguisher under the blanket, and your eyes bug out open wide, and you pop up.  It's hysterical.  I just saw one, go back, Earl Tunes.  Oh, Earl Tunes.  Oh, my God.  It's the iTunes spot that you see with the silhouette of a person with the iPod on, and  it's a silhouette of a gorilla wearing a hat.  Wearing the Black Earl, Black Yankee hat. 
[00:50:00]  God damn, who made that?  It's brilliant.  Oh, by the way, Lex and Terry ripped you guys off, too, on the Mary Kate and Ashley thing  last year.  Every time they did their countdown, they'd start off playing that Def Leppard song, pour  some sugar on me, and then they'd have their little countdown thing, a couple of tools.  We were doing a countdown when they were 14 years old, for God's sake.  Tell him, Fred.  Tell him, Fred.  Tell him, Fred.  Tell him, Fred.  I did it all. 
[00:50:30]  And Fred just sat there, because he's like, I ain't telling him shit.  You know something, Howie?  I'm sick of telling him.  Maybe when you give me enough money where I could actually buy a nice place in New York  City, I'll tell him some stuff.  Yeah.  Perhaps you could put off buying another $4 million Hamptons estate so I can get an apartment  somewhere.  You fuck.  And then I'll tell him everything you want me to tell him.  Yeah, that's the one, dude.  Tell him, Fred.  I come in with the extinguisher.  Look.  How funny is that?  I come popping in, shove the extinguisher under the covers. 
[00:51:00]  That's deeply disturbing.  Well, WackBag.com, the Photoshop section, that's another thing.  Cigars and Scotch made that one.  That's just taken on a life of its own, the whole Photoshop thing on WackBag.com.  Good job, boys.  Good job.  And girls.  But I think we have to say good job, boys.  I think we had, hmm, two, three, four.  Maybe five girls at our appearance yesterday.  Maybe five.  Actually had a lovely ebony princess show up, too.  And two of those girls were questionable at best.  Yeah. 
[00:51:30]  What gender they were.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, B.  Why can't you ever be nice?  I'm nice.  Why can't you just be nice?  Speaking of the message board, Jenna Rosso, his name is.  Jenna Rosso, hardcore Yankee fan.  Mm-hmm.  Says, you have to change your sig pic.  You have to.  I cannot look at the posts with this sig pic.  Have you seen it?  I think it's the only one that disturbs me, too.  It's the.  The little kid?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  It's a little girl right after she sneezed. 
[00:52:00]  There is a ton of snot coming out of both nostrils, dripping down her chin.  I can't look at it.  Please change it.  It's the only sig, out of every sig pic, it's the only one.  I've seen shit ones.  I've seen, it's the only one I cannot look at.  It makes me cringe.  Let's go to John on Long Island.  John, what's up?  Hey, Opie.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, is it, are you the white van guy? 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I got a little starstruck.  I'm sorry I gave you the cheesy thumbs up yesterday.  He gave me the thumbs up as he was driving by.  Well, here's what happened.  I saw a wow sticker.  So I'm like, that's cool.  And any time there's a wow sticker, I kind of pull up and look inside to see what demo  the guy is.  That's right.  We were just talking about that.  It was weird when you see an old black woman driving around and I was like, wow, she doesn't  fit the demo.  Wow, she bought that car from an ONA fan.  Somebody else scraped that sticker off again.  So I'm driving and I see the van.  So as I'm passing, because I'm kind of in a faster lane, we were in some pretty good traffic. 
[00:53:00]  He looks over, I look over at him.  So I'm moving pretty quick and then I'm noticing his driving habits started changing a bit after  he got a look.  He's driving in and out a little more.  Now he's trying to get, he gets right behind me.  And as he's behind me, I could see him kind of looking in the mirror, looking in my side  view mirror, trying to check it out.  And finally, it opened up next to me in the middle lane and he drove by, starts passing  me and looks over and gives me the cool guy thumbs up. 
[00:53:30]  He was Fonzie in the van.  So I gave him the thumbs up, kind of like, yeah.  I wish I took a picture of you giving me the thumbs up back.  It was pretty cheesy.  I just want to apologize.  Oh, that's funny because I thought after you did it and you drove off, I'm like, I just  got the thumbs up from somebody.  Well, usually guys don't pull up next to me, start looking in the van and see what kind  of unit I have.  Like, yeah, well, yeah, I kind of give the look over to see if it's, you know, when we 
[00:54:00]  see the wow stickers, we get very excited.  Yeah.  Very cool.  I have listeners giving me the finger because they think, um, I don't know what they think  because I, you know, drive up to them like waving like, hey, thanks for the support.  And they're like, fuck you.  I just give a glance to see what they're all about.  See what, you know.  All right, guys.  I just want to say a few to old gravy leg.  Punch it out.  All right.  A few to old gravy leg.  Let's say hi to Charlie.  Charlie, Charlie, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Charlie.  Uh, Jimmy, you were talking, I'm sorry, Ant, you were talking earlier about, uh, uh, promos. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  And, uh, happened to hear one yesterday, uh, on Fox News.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  It was, uh, it was the one where, uh, Opie was reading, uh, the article about, uh, where  you were quoted talking about American Idol.  And then Jimmy said, uh, what'd you say after that, that few star in, uh, Barbara?  Oh, okay.  I barely remember doing that, but.  As long as it has our name on there.  There you go.  Yeah, I was pretty, uh, uh, kind of surprised to hear it on, uh, on Fox News. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, that's cool.  That'll help us out.  Yeah.  I was wrong.  Thank you, Charlie.  I can admit when I'm wrong.  I was wrong.  Let's go to Bill in, uh, Kentucky.  Bill.  Hey, how you guys doing?  I'm pretty good, buddy.  Hey, I heard you guys, uh, being promoted by that guy on, uh, that does, that actually hosts  the comedy channel, and I haven't listened to him since, because I've been listening to you guys.  Oh, Sonny Fox?  Yeah, Sonny.  All right, good.  And, uh, I got a story.  I, I, we live on Lake Cumberland, and I have a houseboat, and, uh, I broadcast you guys, 
[00:55:30]  like, over the lake when we're out on the houseboat, and, uh, we had a bunch of, uh,  Christian houseboaters come up and call the DNR police, um, on us.  And the police...  I, I, I hate to interrupt.  What's the DNR police?  The Department of Natural Resources police.  Like the game warden.  They, like, find the lake.  And he came...  Why, because this is air pollution?  Yeah.  Jesus. 
[00:56:00]  Well, he came up to us, and, uh, he, he said, you know, do you guys mind turning it down and  all that, because some people were getting upset, and we were in our own little cove.  But the worst part about it is, um, I got a big old wow poster on the back of the boat,  and as he was leaving, he said, uh, have, have you seen any good hooters lately?  So the guy, the guy, the guy actually was a listener, but he really had to say, turn  it down, you know?  Hey, that's pretty cool.  All right, thank you, Bill.  Take care, guys.  Yeah, this thing is starting to take on a life of its own. 
[00:56:30]  It's starting to get really exciting again.  Yep.  Here we go again, Anthony.  I knew it would take about a year to really start taking off, because, uh, if you remember,  even when we came to New York at NEW, it took a while before we really started catching  on, remember all the nice phone calls we got from people?  Play the music.  Look, guys, shut up and play the music.  You're there to play the music.  We're just sitting there after a day, you know, we're able to squeeze in a little bit  of the funny, a little bit of the interesting in between the songs, feeling good about ourselves, 
[00:57:00]  taking some phone calls, thinking maybe it's people that want to get in and involved with  the show, comment on what we've been talking about.  Hey, you're on the air.  Uh, play the music, idiots.  You're not there to talk.  If only you talk, I'll go home.  Play the music.  So it takes time.  We understand.  Well, we're going to have to take a lot of these calls today.  Chris in Toronto.  Go ahead, Chris.  Yeah, boys.  Welcome to Canada.  Thank you. 
[00:57:30]  Yes?  What part of, uh, your, your content is going to be, uh, Canadian now?  Yeah, don't we need a certain amount of Canadian content?  Well, it was just announced that, uh, XM's Canadian partner awarded license to offer satellite  radio service in Canada.  Yeah.  Now you, uh, now you can find Canadians could listen to us legally.  You don't have to, uh, get some kind of an assumed address down here in the States.  Yeah, that's going to be great, guys.  I'm hearing all sorts of rumors, though. 
[00:58:00]  Like, XM's going to have to dedicate, like, five channels to Canadian content.  Are you kidding?  That's what I'm hearing.  I think it's, uh, let's see.  It's five for every 50 channels.  That's crazy.  You guys have nothing to add.  You know what they, you know what they do?  You guys don't have enough content for five channels on this fine service.  Oh, yeah, we got Bob and Doug McKenzie.  Exactly.  There you go.  That's it.  Hey.  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  That's what you do.  You just, uh, take five channels and have, like, no bandwidth, so it sounds like a tin can, 
[00:58:30]  and you play Neil Young songs all day.  We'll give you, we'll give you Canadian traffic.  Yeah.  Hey, a lot of traffic, eh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Canadian traffic, Neil Young tunes, Rush songs.  Some Rush.  Yeah, tell Jimmy, Neil Young's better than Nazi.  And, and you guys will get the hockey, uh, minute with, uh, sponsored by La Bats.  The hockey minute. 
[00:59:00]  Watch it out, boss.  And we can talk about the Canadian ballet.  Very nice to have Canada aboard, though, legally.  Isn't that something?  You think it's nice?  Tom on Long Island.  You don't like Canada?  I'd rather them listen illegally so we can completely control the content and not cater to Canadian content.  Yeah.  What's up, Tom?  Hey, guys.  You know, you were talking about, uh, Anthony, about how you were really not quoted a lot in the Time article.  Uh-huh.  And I'm wondering if it's because maybe you weren't listening and you just repeated everything Opie said five minutes later. 
[00:59:30]  Well, maybe that's what happened, right?  The old listening.  The old not listening thing.  God, is that painful to listen to on the replays.  It's sometimes frustrating.  I was listening to the replay with the graham cracker joke that Jimmy did, and then it bombed, and I wasn't listening, and I came right back with the same joke because I wasn't listening.  And, uh, we had joked about it that day.  But then I went home and listened to the replay and listening to the whole build-up and me actually doing the bad joke right after Jimmy did it.  It's painful. 
[01:00:00]  It's a cringe moment.  Hey, Canada.  What's up, Jim?  Yeah.  Hi.  Hey.  Um, I just called to let you know that, uh, they're projecting one million subscribers in Canada by 2007.  Really?  I think they'll do a lot more than that.  A lot more.  Well, once it takes off, you know, though, I'm sure it will be as well.  I mean...  Can we get the wow going up here because in some of the provinces, uh, uh, being topless in public for women is legal.  So, once that, uh, gets going, it should be pretty interesting. 
[01:00:30]  You guys are starved for entertainment.  I mean, it'll, we'll do, uh, way more than a million subs in Canada.  Way more.  You'll see.  The radio, the commercial radio up here is just horrible.  Jim, you don't have to tell me.  I lived in Buffalo, so I got all the Canadian stations when I was living up there.  It's awful.  And some of the stations do a pretty good job.  They're cool.  The production's cool.  The jocks are all right.  But then they have to play all that Canadian shit.  Well, you know, you'd be surprised because what, that was the, uh, the Canadian government 
[01:01:00]  concerned that the Canadian artists will not get their exposure on American satellite radio.  And the Canadian artists are saying that they're getting more airplay on all your stations than all the stations in Canada combined.  See, if, if, uh, if you're a really good band and you happen to come out of Canada, you're going to get your airplay.  I mean, Rush proved that, obviously.  Neil Young proved that.  The fact is, there's a lot of just mediocre, uh, Canadian bands that, that don't deserve the exposure. 
[01:01:30]  Well, the surprising thing is that one group I never hear on any of the, uh, rock stations on, on XM is, like, Tragically Hip.  Have you ever heard of them, brought of Kingston?  Yeah, Tragically Hip is huge in Canada for some reason.  And, uh, they just never really made it in the States.  They had, like, uh, one or two hits down here, but.  Yeah.  Are they still even performing?  Oh, yeah, actually, they're opening up for the Rolling Stones when they're in Canada.  Jesus, look at that.  So, uh, I guess it's one of the biggest bands in Canada these days, right? 
[01:02:00]  Oh, yeah, one of the top.  I think we even had them on the air once, Anthony.  Really?  Played, uh, when we were at, uh, WNEW.  Really?  All right, Jim, thank you.  Yeah, talk to you later, thank you.  All right, one more call.  Uh, Guido in Philly.  Yo, what's up?  What's up, Guido?  Not much.  I've got a couple questions.  One is, you guys are going to do that thing on the news that you guys had in the newspaper yesterday  about some woman marriage thing that Anthony was going to talk about?  The thing.  Oh, okay, uh.  I'm dying here.  I love when Anthony talks about marriage shit.  It's the funniest thing in the world.  Yeah, you're talking about the wife shot dead at, uh, split hearing. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, and the other thing is, you guys bring it back any old bits, like the, uh, the 55-gallon  drum tank, and, or if you guys are still friends with Sam, from, uh, Sex for Sam.  Yeah, I don't think Sex for Sam will be making a comeback.  Uh, we're still friends with, uh, Jim Cook.  Okay.  I mean, we haven't talked to him in a while, but he had, uh, nothing but great things to  say about us after we got fired, and said, look, guys, he actually called me personally  and said, guys, I gotta save my own ass.  I apologize in advance, but at this point, it's pretty much, you know, every man for themselves. 
[01:03:00]  I'm in deep shit up here, and I might have to say some things, and, but just know that  I still love you guys, and if the time was right, I'd advertise with you guys again.  He said that to me.  So.  What about all the other bits?  You think I'll bring them back?  Oh, yeah, we're bringing back, uh, some of the old bits.  We're coming up with new bits.  You know, it's a work in, you know, progress.  God bless you guys.  Love is punching out.  God bless us.  God bless America.  Anthony, we'll get into that story about the wife next.  How's that?  Yes.  You want to hit something here? 
[01:03:30]  Huh?  No.  Okay.  Yeah, well, okay.  We're going to take our first break on the show today.  Ben Bailey, sitting in for old Jimmy Norton.  Yes, he is.  He should be here any moment.  Weren't we supposed to have musical guests?  What happened with that?  Lounge Against the Machine.  Yeah.  They're going to perform around 9, 9.30.  I was just watching the, what was that, Dawn of the Dead?  The remake they did?  Last night.  That was great.  And they got Lounge Against the Machine in that.  Oh, really?  Playing, uh, some Disturbed. 
[01:04:00]  Get Down with the Sickness.  It's pretty funny.  That movie's really good.  I watched it again last night, and, uh, really good movie.  I love the goddamn running zombies.  One thing about the slow-moving zombie, it's like, it's pretty scary, but they really got  to sneak up on you.  You really got to be stupid to get killed by a zombie.  Yeah.  Unless there's a whole shitload of them and you're dropped in the middle.  Yeah.  Then, you know, nothing you can do.  They're zombies.  But the running zombie.  They were the first movie with this running zombie.  And that's the key.  They're balls out running. 
[01:04:30]  Now, you know, you can't just sit there and taunt them.  They'll chase you.  But when they hold up the signs that say Jay Leno, and he shoots the zombie in the head  that looks like Jay Leno, then Burt Reynolds, about 28 days later, had fast-moving zombies.  But they weren't quite real zombies.  They were more like sick people.  Zombies are the dead people, risen from the dead.  That still have good muscle tone.  Right.  Yeah, the zombies that just kind of sauntered toward you.  Yeah. 
[01:05:00]  I mean, please.  If they catch you, then you have no business living.  I like that one.  And the end of that movie is sick because you think everything's cool.  They make it to the boat.  They're going to this island or something.  They're just going out away from the mainland thinking that they're going to be safe.  And the credits start rolling.  And I remember seeing in the movie theater, everyone's leaving.  And I'm sitting there because I don't like.  I sit and wait for everyone to leave the theater.  Then I get up and leave.  I don't want to be in the mass of animals.  And sitting there.  And all of a sudden, next to the credits, the movie's still playing. 
[01:05:30]  And the end of the movie happens when the credits are rolling.  If you leave while the credits are going, you miss the end of the movie.  Which is them coming up to the island, actually starving on the water, running out of water, running out of gas.  They finally get up to this island.  And then the island is just chock full of zombies.  And they've got nowhere else to go.  So you assume they all get killed.  Now the next one's coming out.  The sequel to that, which is Land of the Dead.  Land of the Dead.  Looking forward to that one.  All right.  Love zombie movies.  You've got to talk about your Star Wars experience, too, when we get back. 
[01:06:00]  Yes.  Gaming.  We've got friends on there.  Quick break.  We've got to eat some food.  Skeptics on there.  And we'll continue with the ONA program.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus.  Hey, what's up?  Yo.  Yo.  Oh, go buy a boat and rent a gun, man.  You're saying you're single, you have money, and you're playing fucking games until 3 o'clock in the morning?  At least Norton gets horned.  What the fuck are you doing? 
[01:06:30]  What is 3 o'clock in the morning a no-fuck zone, my friend?  I'm doing just...  There's fucking after 3 a.m.?  Good point, Ant.  Thank you.  Jimmy.  Jimmy, trust me.  I'm doing just fine.  Yeah, I know, but still, man.  I mean, I live my car is going through your eyes.  I mean, I'm married.  Yeah, well, you want to live through Ope's Eyes?  You have to move to Ten Town.  I languish in Foursville, and occasionally I'll tap into Fivetown, but...  Foursville?  Let's just put it this way.  Jim's stories are exciting, and they're fun to listen to. 
[01:07:00]  If I told my stories, you'd kill yourself.  Because they're just healthy and annoying.  The hot chick in Foursville.  She's still only a four.  She's still only a four.  Occasionally, once in a while, I get lucky, and I take a ride into the village of Six.  But never Seventropolis?  No, Seventropolis is way too expensive.  And Ten Town, I mean, they actually divert any plane I'm on around it.  I'm not even allowed to fly over Ten Town. 
[01:07:30]  Ope and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Are you breathing?  Are you breathing?  Now, now, here you go.  Are you alive?  Will you listen to me?  I'm going to talk about the biggies.  Now, someone is going to die.  Will you listen to me?  Listen to me.  Die, listen to me.  Die, say, wake up.  Are you alive?  Will you listen to me?  I'm just a duck of a biggies.  Now, someone is going to die. 
[01:08:00]  Will you listen to me?  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  Say, say, are you breathing?  I am, uh, I'm catching a little flack.  Understandably so.  I said, uh, Land of the Dead is a sequel.  But I just consider any of the new zombie movies that come out are sequels.  I don't know.  Something of, if it ends in Of the Dead, and it's something I haven't heard before, it's a sequel to me.  Exactly.  But, uh, this guy says it's, uh, Night of the Living Dead, then Dawn of the Dead, the original from the 70s, Day of the Dead, and Land of the Dead. 
[01:08:30]  Correct.  Is that correct?  Yep.  And that's from a portable phone.  Thank you for, uh, clearing that up.  I know.  I just say sequel.  I don't know the order.  I just enjoy the zombie movies.  Love it.  And Shaun of the Dead.  I thought it was, uh, hysterical, too.  I don't feel like hit or miss with that one.  Some people just didn't like it at all.  People don't like that English humor, no matter what it is sometimes.  They just don't get it.  But, uh, I thought Simon Pegg is hysterical in that.  Very funny.  And the movie's very funny. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, I thought we were getting our eating done before the show.  I tried, man.  It's, you know something?  I think it's not working, though.  Why?  Because I ate before the show.  I finally got my boar's head turkey.  Very nice.  It was nice and moist.  It wasn't like kindling turkey, like I usually get.  And, uh, I ate it.  And there was a lot of turkey on it.  On the bagel.  And, uh, I came walking in here to do the show.  And I'm like, I am stuffed. 
[01:09:30]  I need a nap.  I'm exhausted.  It was like I ate a full dinner.  It was like I had Thanksgiving.  You had to unloosen your belt buckle.  Yeah, I was like, oh, oh, let me just kick back here and take a nap.  We had to throw an old football game on the tube for you.  No, turkey has that thing in it.  That thing that makes you sleepy.  The thing?  What are they called?  That makes you sleepy.  Tryptophan.  There you go.  Like I said, that thing.  Uh-huh.  That's what I did yesterday at the, uh, appearance.  Stuck my foot out in tryptophan.  Ha-ha.  Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah.  Wah-wah-wah.  Apparently the RCS, uh, promos are running again also. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  No, we won't be there again today at noon.  No.  Once is enough for now.  And all you original people who like to, uh, instant feedback and say,  wow, great, you guys are going to be there again today?  You're one of 100 people that posted the same thing.  Very original.  Just assume that someone else is going to post that.  Right.  And don't waste your time.  Tell him, Fred.  Tell him, Fred.  Fred's not going to say shit.  That makes me laugh every day.  I love that.  Every day.  Can't wait until he blows on him one of these days. 
[01:10:30]  Tell him, Fred.  I think, I think, I, I give him a year into satellite radio before he explodes with just  the thought of Howard pulling in a half a billion dollars.  Yeah.  And him getting, you know.  A shitty apartment somewhere in Queens.  Where he's doing like the real back work for the, for the show also.  Of course.  Of the heavy lifting.  Of course he does.  All right, Anthony.  Moving on to other things.  Where's Ben Belly?  Is he here yet?  Not here yet.  Okay. 
[01:11:00]  Our comedian friends, they're all oversleeping lately.  That's what it is.  You know them in mornings.  Adam Farrar stumbled in here the other day.  He didn't even know where he was.  Yeah.  With a toothbrush and toothpaste in his hand.  Hey, pal.  And he wasn't tired.  He wasn't even doing a bit.  He was like, what the hell's going on?  No, we all went in to take a leak and he's brushing his teeth.  It's funny because sometimes I still feel like we're doing afternoon radio.  I really do.  So it just has that feeling because we're up, you know, really early and then rolling.  And then you're reminded when some of these comedians come in.  You're like, oh, how tired they are. 
[01:11:30]  Dude, I'm exhausted.  It's so early.  And they're like, yeah, it's so early.  I'm like, it's 8.30.  We've been up since 5.  Yeah.  Now it's not early.  All right, Anthony.  Wife shot dead at split hearing.  Oops.  This is what happens.  People love to hear your take on these stories.  This is what happens, people.  Middletown, Connecticut.  A former state trooper fatally shot his estranged wife, critically wounded her lawyer, and then shot himself outside a courthouse where they were scheduled for a divorce hearing yesterday, police said.  Retired trooper Michael, last name I can't pronounce, 47, of Torrington, was listed in critical condition at Hartford Hospital last night. 
[01:12:00]  His 43-year-old wife Donna died at the scene.  Julie Porzio, 42, Donna's attorney, was listed in serious but stable condition.  He was a wonderful person, a state cop for all those years.  I don't know what went through his mind, said the ex-trooper's uncle, Anthony.  He was going through a bad divorce.  He just snapped. 
[01:12:30]  There you go.  I used to read these, and I guess a lot of people read them, people that haven't been through the process of a divorce.  And in a way, you're like, I don't really understand why anyone would snap, right?  You would read that, and as I would in the past, go, wow, what a kook.  What a kook.  How do you do that?  What the hell reason do you have to pull out a gun and shoot all the participants in your divorce like that, the lawyer?  And then you go through the process.  And again, like Chris Rock has said, you know, I don't condone it. 
[01:13:00]  Wouldn't do it.  But I understand.  You get a level of understanding.  And just the fact that a rational-thinking human being that has been through a divorce can actually understand the mindset of a murderer just speaks volumes as to the divorce process.  That I understand this guy and what was going through his head that might lead him to shooting and killing people just goes to show you what the process is all about. 
[01:13:30]  I observed you through your divorce proceedings, which took, what, over two years?  Yeah.  Right?  Well over two years.  Well over two years.  Yeah.  Man, you were just absolutely miserable.  Misery is just what people see on the outside.  And you had a happy life.  Well, you still do.  Oh, yeah.  You started having a happy life after you got separated from your wife.  But this freaking thing still just dragged you down day after day.  It was just a constant albatross.  I would watch your blood pressure go through the roof. 
[01:14:00]  An albatross around your neck the entire time.  And like I said, you understand the mindset of somebody.  Because if you have any type of capacity to actually harm people, which I don't.  I just don't.  I'm not that kind of guy.  Sorry.  If I guess my life or loved one's life were in danger, I'd pull out my rapier and I would start a sword fighting with him, perhaps.  But normally, I just don't have it in me to hurt other people. 
[01:14:30]  Right.  You know?  But if you have like the slightest capacity to do that, and if you're a cop, a trooper, obviously you do.  Sorry.  I didn't mean to distract you, Anthony.  That's the cereal I eat.  Oh.  That clogs me up.  Oh.  They're showing it on the news.  The optimum power.  Oh, great.  Suck it down.  She'll be backed up for a year.  She's going to be complaining of bloated belly.  Yeah, she'll look pregnant in a week, and then finally this stupid cereal will decide to release from your system.  Is it that slow a news day that they are reviewing cereals? 
[01:15:00]  It's Honey Nut Cheerios versus optimal power.  We're watching them eat cereal.  They're ripping you off, Opie.  Tell them, Fred.  I ate cereal on the air first.  Okay.  I think a much better choice, if you want an oat cereal, would be something like Tashi Heart to Heart.  I've seen this a lot lately.  Oh, my.  You're kidding me.  This is a bit, right?  It's much more nutritious.  She just said she's seen this cereal in the store.  Because, you know, we all know about the kids going down the aisle in the supermarket with all of these kind of cereals.  Oh, the kid cereal. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, even these boxes glow in the dark, I think.  You know, most of these kids cereals, or the cereals peddled to kids.  I mean, you might as well take candy, throw it in a bowl, and pour milk over it.  Well, you've heard the advice, parents.  And then throw it in a multivitamin for good measure at the end.  Oh, come on, really?  Pretty much.  These are all loaded with sugar.  In fact, most of these in the ingredient list include sugar in three or four calories.  Lucky.  There's a Reese's Pieces cereal?  Wow.  Oh, you haven't seen the cereal aisle lately?  That's brutal.  Not that.  I get my Raisin Bran, Opie.  That's what I eat.  That part may be true. 
[01:16:00]  You're welcome to taste it.  The cereal aisle is just out of control.  Count Chocula.  Yeah.  And Quaker Oats, their statement, breakfast provides the fuel kids need to help them power  through their days.  All right.  And Kellogg's, their statement was, breakfast cereals are a positive choice for consumers  of all ages who want to achieve a healthy lifestyle.  Who's quoting?  Elo?  You know, again, I talk about this.  Holy crap.  They have nothing to do.  They're talking about cereal.  They started their show talking about Tom Cruise getting engaged, and that's all they had 
[01:16:30]  today.  Who booked the cereal guy?  That's the dude from Celebrity Fitness, matter of fact.  It is?  He's now a big star.  That's something.  He has a little feature on Good Morning America once a week or so.  Doing health reports today on cereal.  But they had my cereal that I've bailed on.  Yeah, thank God.  The gut buster.  Cement.  It's cement.  It was sacrete.  I'm still going through the same roll of toilet paper I bought maybe a month ago.  Yeah. 
[01:17:00]  There's no wiping.  I mean, you're white because you're not an animal, but there's nothing happening.  It's because of these cereals.  It's like a rabbit comes out in pellets.  No, no, no.  It just falls in the bowl.  Dude.  Switch your tail and leave.  It hits the water.  I mean, if you want to know what I go through.  No.  Can I say no?  And I only go like every two to three days.  Yeah.  Take a brick and just drop it into your toilet bowl.  That's the sound these things make when they finally fall out. 
[01:17:30]  That is disgusting.  Anyway, getting back to the divorce.  Ah.  Ah.  Yes.  I was saying if anybody has the ability to harm anybody or get into some physical altercation  like a cop, like this guy, then I can absolutely see how you would take that violence out on  other people.  You go through a divorce and the wife and the lawyer, it's the wife and the wife's lawyer,  become an enemy that you have never had in your life. 
[01:18:00]  They are your arch enemy, trying their hardest to destroy you.  To break you.  To kill you.  To take away what is yours and do it in a way that is so underhanded and sneaky and nasty  that you just, if you have this ability to harm people, it brings it right to the surface  and you want to just have awful things happen to them. 
[01:18:30]  I would drive home from these court appearances going like...  Yeah!  Like, I swear to you.  In my truck, driving, squeezing the steering wheel, driving...  Yeah!  Yeah!  Fuck!  Biting things.  Biting the steering wheel.  And, you know...  My Mercury Mountaineer has teeth marks in the steering wheel where I bit it when I got rid  of it.  And you had a great life. 
[01:19:00]  We were on...  Oh, yeah.  I mean, you still do, but we were on an amazing run in radio and you were miserable because  of this stupid divorce.  Because it doesn't matter.  Imagine having everything you've wanted in life and along with it, there's someone next  to you poking you in the neck going, hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  No matter how much fun you're having, how much you're enjoying yourself, no matter what 
[01:19:30]  you're doing, you're out, you're having fun, you're having sex.  You're at a comedy club, you're in a comedy club having sex, you're just...  Whatever you're doing, that's fun.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Poking you in the neck.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Shit, I'm having fun.  Ow!  Ow!  Hey!  Hey!  It never ends.  She was never happy.  It doesn't...  She was never happy.  Of course not.  It was amazing.  Of course not.  All the great stuff that was happening to us. 
[01:20:00]  Oh!  And she was never happy.  And I could never do any right.  What about your...  I could do anything right.  What about your wife?  Wow!  Oh, jeez.  Bringing a few personal experiences in.  That's great.  We had some...  On some similar experiences.  Parallel tracks sometimes.  Oh, I was...  I could never do any right.  It was one of those relationships.  And remember when I was like begging, can I please get a cell phone? 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  It's like the late 90s.  And, you know, we're doing pretty good for ourselves.  And I wanted a cell phone.  I wanted a cell phone.  You don't need a cell phone.  What do you need a cell phone for?  Because Opie has one?  Uh, no.  Because the whole world has one.  Because the whole...  Yeah, the whole world communicates this way now.  Why was I the bad guy?  Oh, she had to blame it on someone.  Was she going to blame it on herself?  I just remember...  And then she's like, you could get a phone for the car, but not one of those cell phones. 
[01:21:00]  I go, what if there's an emergency?  Get one for the car.  Who am I?  Fucking Canon?  Yeah.  What is this, 1976?  Hello, mobile operator.  Get me 555.  Get me Opie.  I'm going to be late today.  Get me Opie.  I'm stuck in traffic on the LIE.  Can you patch me through to his StarTac?  Yeah, I would like to have one.  Believe me.  Why blame me, though?  Oh, I had to.  One of the best stories ever, Anthony and I used to commute from Huntington, Long Island. 
[01:21:30]  You know, we'd take turns.  Yeah.  I got out of driving a lot because I'd call Hank, oh, dude, I'm not feeling it today.  Remember those?  I'm surprised you trusted me because there were some times I would look at a poll and go,  that looks inviting.  Quick swerve.  That's why a book has to be written because, you know, a lot of our faithful listeners,  they thought we were just having the times of our lives.  We were fucking miserable.  Under the surface.  On so many levels, we were so miserable. 
[01:22:00]  And we were getting all that attention and people were wishing they could be us and stuff.  And they had no idea.  Oh, what was bubbling below the surface.  They had no idea.  But one day I pulled up to Anthony's abode.  Can I tell the story again?  Which one?  It's really simple.  Like, you would get up at, I think we would, what, leave around 10 o'clock in the morning,  something like that.  And you would get up, you were a night guy, so you would get up maybe 9.30, 9.40, do  a quick shower and roll out the door just in time for my honk, honk.  Yep. 
[01:22:30]  You know, time to go to work, Ant.  Mech, mech.  Work.  Ooh, let's not use that word again.  Sorry.  And I remember one time pulling up, and there was just a battle going on on the front stoop  at the front door.  Yeah.  Like, yelling.  Yeah.  One-way yelling.  I just never wanted to go home.  Because you're just like, oh, God.  And I remember you jumped in the car, and I'm like, Ant, what could you have possibly  done?  I know you had.  From the door of Opie's car to the front stoop?  Yeah, I must have done something wrong.  No, I mean, this is leaving your house.  Oh, right. 
[01:23:00]  And I'm thinking, Ant, you haven't been awake that long.  I know your schedule.  Right, right.  I just woke up.  I'm like, what could you have possibly done to get under a skin this early in the morning  when you've only been up maybe 15 to 20 minutes?  Taken a breath.  That's what I did.  There was never any reason.  There was, you know, I understand where it came from.  There wasn't reason.  Believe me.  I know it wasn't me.  Okay?  It was the other man in our life.  Jack Daniels. 
[01:23:30]  That guy.  Your old pal, Jack Daniels.  Old pal, Jack from Tennessee.  Old Jack from Tennessee's visiting.  Good old Jack.  Yeah, a lot of fun.  Jack was much more important.  A lot of fun, that Jack.  But the anger, the anger that builds up.  And then you read these stories that the husband walked in and shot the wife and lawyer.  And where I used to think they were nuts, I'd look now and go, the guy got pushed. 
[01:24:00]  That's what happens.  You get pushed.  You get pushed to a point where you just can't take it anymore.  When they're looking at what you're spending, it's not, realize this.  It's your money.  You are going out there and earning it.  They're trying to get a cut of what you're earning based on how much responsibility she had for where you are today making that kind of money.  That was the thing that pissed me off the most because I got involved in Anthony's divorce case because she was trying to claim that she had something to do with Anthony's success. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, that's the whole thing.  A lawyer will twist it around and try to make it seem like the wife has a lot to do with the husband's success.  And that way they can get a percentage of whatever you make.  And they...  Like an agent.  They point out an example where her voice is on one of our bits for maybe two seconds.  Yeah.  An old bit.  And our career hinged on that moment.  Of course it did.  That...  I'm like, are you kidding?  Why are you wasting my time with this shit?  Dude, there was one thing that came up where, get this 18,000 degrees of separation. 
[01:25:00]  They were trying to say, because I was with the band Rotgut, right?  Me and my brother were in Rotgut.  Me and my brother wrote song parodies, which we sent in to you.  A band that almost made it, by the way.  Yeah, very close.  Yeah, whatever.  Rotgut was composed of me, my brother, Sky Tony, who was the drummer, and another guy, Joe,  who was a guitar player. 
[01:25:30]  Tony and Joe were looking for a singer, so they were trying to get in touch with me.  They went down to the bar that my ex-wife worked at to talk to her to get in touch with me.  That meeting, the lawyer was trying to bring up that, if that meeting didn't happen and  we didn't hook up, the song parody never would have been made to give to you to get me on  the air.  Like they would have given up right then and there and not found me in the same town.  They just knew they could go there to find where I was going to be. 
[01:26:00]  If that didn't work, then called my brother or something.  But because they went there to the bar, she went, this is the rage that was bubbling.  So they try to get as much money as they can.  But not only that, here's where it really started like, where I drive home and go,  they would then look at what you're spending.  Now regardless of what you're sending the wife, they look and pick apart what you're spending. 
[01:26:30]  Like, oh, you bought this for this person.  How much did that cost?  And I see here the bank statement, you made a withdrawal for this.  Where did that go?  Now, on top of shoveling money to the wife during the proceedings,  Plus having your bank account.  They're picking apart what you're spending your money on.  It's my money!  I'm earning it on a daily basis.  What was their reasoning?  Their reasoning is, well, if you have this money to blow,  if you can then go out and buy gifts for this person, 
[01:27:00]  Hello?  Oh, then you obviously have this disposable income that can now go to her.  Two girls for every boy.  If you can afford gifts, then you can afford more support payments.  Like I'm supposed to only buy food and stay in a hovel because anything extra should go to her.  That's the rage that makes guys pick up guns and shoot the lawyer and the wife. 
[01:27:30]  If that's what happens.  See?  Got me all wound up again.  Let's go to Tom in Kentucky.  Tom, what's up?  How you doing this morning, guys?  Pretty good.  Hey, man.  I completely understand what you're talking about.  I mean, there's mornings where I just want to get up.  I mean, first of all, you've got to understand, I have a crappy job.  You know, I bust my butt every day.  You know, and it's like in five years I've built up, you know, I had a real nice house, had the dog, you know, had the kid. 
[01:28:00]  Everything was just going along so great.  And then, wham, divorce.  Now I'm living in a one-bedroom shack.  I'm driving a crappy car that won't even start half the time.  And all my money is going towards child support and alimony.  Well, I thank God I didn't have any kids.  I thank the Lord every day for striking down every sperm cell that I did not have a child. 
[01:28:30]  Because the idea of having to have a relationship with an ex-wife because you have a kid together,  to have to discuss things like schooling and clothes and just have to, you have to continue a relationship.  No.  Cut it clean.  That's a good point.  You get screwed in the divorce and then you still have to have some kind of communication.  Right, communication.  Because you had kids.  And it has to be civil for the children's sake and you have to see them once a week as you're picking kids. 
[01:29:00]  Hey, hey.  You know what I like?  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  That's it.  Cut it clean.  Here's a check.  That's all I want.  That's all I want you to see.  Goodbye.  Let's go to Jim in Illinois.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Well, I was just wondering, what would have been the outcome when you and Opie came outside the bank  after finding out how much money you really had in the bank? 
[01:29:30]  What if your ex-wife and your lawyer would have walked by you at that particular moment?  Oh, if I had a gun?  Uh-huh.  No.  No, I'm not that kind.  Believe me, I was enraged.  That was one of the most funniest moments of my life.  On a sick, twisted level, I openly laugh at my pal because it was so ridiculous.  I had to laugh.  It was either that or Anthony and I would have probably cried together.  Yeah.  And held each other.  Oh, it was bad. 
[01:30:00]  Well, listen, guys.  Forty large.  A true friend has to laugh in that experience because it's so ridiculous.  What are you going to do?  Forty Gs.  Forty Gs.  Completely wiped out of the account that Anthony was going to that morning to take half because  he's a good guy.  I was going to take half.  I was going to take $20,000, leave her $20,000, you know, whatever.  I get there, my entire life savings, everything I've earned in my life was gone.  Forty Gs. 
[01:30:30]  Forty thousand dollars.  That was every dime I had.  We had just started making real money where I was able to bank money.  And, yeah, me a bag of shells.  Easy come, easy go.  I had it and I went with it.  I had it and she went with it.  That was it.  Forty large.  Gone.  Poof.  Goodbye.  Whew.  And I just laughed.  I'm like, sorry, Anthony, but this is very funny. 
[01:31:00]  And at the time, I'm trying to rationalize.  I'm thinking, well, if it cost me 40 large to get out of this thing, because I was under  the impression that maybe that was it.  She'd take the money.  We'd get a divorce.  It's over.  You know, you start thinking, like, good things are going to happen.  No, no.  That was the beginning.  The beginning of a lot more Gs flying out of my bank account.  Eee.  Whew.  All right, let's go to Dave in Connecticut.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, man.  Listen, I just wanted to say, I knew that. 
[01:31:30]  I used to work with that guy up in Middletown.  And when I started work eight years ago, he was just retiring.  And he came back to work afterwards and kind of took me under his wing.  He was a great guy.  And thank you.  Very classy.  Very always had his stuff together.  Well put together guy.  You just never saw it coming from him.  They broke him.  They absolutely broke him.  Wow.  I mean, this is a guy who always had his shit together.  I mean, he was always, you know, a good looking guy, always in shape, well dressed. 
[01:32:00]  Just drove him over the edge.  Fell apart.  They, it's the worst.  All right, Dave.  Thank you.  Okay.  Let's go to Jim in St. Louis.  Jim, what's up?  Morning, boys.  Morning.  Hey, I live in a small county outside of St. Louis, all farm country out there.  About 14,000 people in the entire county.  And we've had three divorce attorneys killed in about the last five years.  That's great. 
[01:32:30]  That's terrific.  Obviously, rednecks with guns and divorce attorneys don't mix.  Watch out, boys.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Let's go to Nutley and say hi to Steve.  What's up, Steve?  How you doing, guys?  When I got divorced from my wife, my best friend defended her in the courtroom, all right?  He's my best friend.  He defends her.  And a month later, I find out this guy Bocafoli's sleeping with her.  Hey, there you go. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, how nice is it, right?  From yesterday, by the way.  He's slipping in little things.  Thanks, Steve.  That really worked.  Worked well.  Thank you.  Wait, what was he doing?  I don't know.  He seemed like Bocafoli.  He's trying to do a Baba Booey reference.  Oh.  He called yesterday, too, with one.  Oh, dude, why don't you just say it?  Yeah, I know.  Just call up the show and say it.  Get back in your DeLorean.  Go back to 1989.  And then we'll all be uncomfortable because we don't know what to do about it.  Oh, my God, how do we cover the fact that that got out? 
[01:33:30]  Jesus, dude, it's not 18.  It's not 18.  That's right.  A covered wagon, Robin.  Jesus, 1988.  If you have to say it, say it.  Who the fuck cares?  He probably tapes it.  I'll call up Howard.  Yeah, you're on the air.  Howard, I got this a click.  All right.  Let's go to Gooch in Cleveland.  Gooch, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  How are you all doing today?  All right.  Anthony.  Yes, sir.  Just because of your story, which, by the way, it's one of my favorite things you talk 
[01:34:00]  about, I laugh my ass off every time.  Glad I can.  My pain has brought your laughter.  Oh, you know what?  Anthony has only scratched the surface.  I don't know how far to push Anthony on this subject, so I'm just waiting for him to let  the floodgates open.  I see the awful, terrible things in my life and turn it into something funny.  But anyway, because of your story.  Chester!  Here, boys.  Come on, Chester!  Chester!  Chester!  Here, boys.  Come on, Chester! 
[01:34:30]  Chester!  Come on, Chester!  Chester!  Here, boys.  Come on, Chester!  Where's Chester?  Chester!  That's my favorite part.  Where's Chester?  Where's Chester?  Where's my little Chester?  Chester?  What does that say, Nike, on your hip?  But because of your story, Anthony, I started my own company last year.  Me and my buddy did.  We put a clause in our contract that says if either one of us got married without a prenup,  we'd lose our share of the company. 
[01:35:00]  Holy jeez, what a great idea.  Well, and I had to tell you, because my buddy said, where'd you get that from?  I said, you have to listen to this radio show sometime, because I have heard, not just from  you, but all the guys that work for me, every one of them got raped in a divorce, and I  refuse to ever have that happen to me.  I want to let you know, you've saved a life, Anthony.  This is a great way to get a prenup if you have a problem with a girl that is going to  be all defensive about a prenup.  You get one of your friends together, you start a business, you could do that very cheaply, 
[01:35:30]  and then you have a thing in your contract with your business partner that each of you  needs a prenup if you get married.  Yep.  If you don't get it, you lose your head.  And then you could tell the girl, look, this is the way this is, if I want to continue having  a...  Bravo.  Wow.  Brilliant.  I still believe in marriage, but I cannot believe that people would just get married  without some kind of contract that protects them just a little bit.  I don't get it anymore, because in this country, the reality is that the man gets screwed in 
[01:36:00]  the divorce proceedings.  Yeah.  Every time we talk about it, we get a few ladies here and there that say, no, I was the one  that got screwed.  You know what?  You're the exception to the rule, right?  Getting married as a man, you are signing a contract, basically, that says you're going  to get completely fucked.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You would not say...  If it was a business deal, you would never...  You would laugh that contract off the table, but when you get married, you sign it with  a big smile on your face. 
[01:36:30]  And a heart on it in your pants.  You know how many people want to get divorced out there that they just know they can't?  They do the math in their heads and go, oh, Christ.  There's a saying, cheaper to keeper.  Yep.  That's what they say.  Cheaper to keeper.  So, Anthony, thank you.  Thank you, Anthony.  Well, I'm glad someone got a little help out of this.  All right.  Punch it out, fellas.  There he goes.  Later.  Well, here's a question for you, Ant.  Rob in Kansas.  Rob?  Hey, why'd you marry this monster?  Is she a good lay or something?  Holy shit.  Well, that's a good question. 
[01:37:00]  You should have gave her a page on your website.  Punch it out.  Yeah, it was...  I don't know.  I've been asked that question, and it's one of those things.  It's like, boy, I don't know.  I guess I was just in a...  Yeah, maybe I was drinking.  I was just in a time and part of my life where I felt I should be doing something adult,  I think.  I think that's pretty much what it was.  I was...  I hadn't changed doing anything I was doing since I was 18.  I was living the same life.  I was in a shitty apartment. 
[01:37:30]  My friends would come over every day.  We would drink beers and stack them up on the table in a big pyramid.  We would shoot each other with dart guns, watch porno on TV.  It was just, I felt that I had to do something that was going to bring me into adulthood.  You always think in your 20s that when you hit 30, you're going to be this different adult person.  And then when you hit your 30s and you're going, I am still a kid. 
[01:38:00]  I'm still looked at by adults, what you feel are adults as a kid.  You know, your mother and her friends are still looking at you like a child and you kind of feel like one still.  So, I felt I had to make this move into adulthood, you know, and getting married was something you did as an adult.  Whether you're young or old, it was something you did that was mature, you know.  Right.  So, I felt like after I did that, perhaps things would change. 
[01:38:30]  I would still act the same and do the same things, but somehow things are going to miraculously change.  I was still going to have my friends over and drink and all that.  You have said this on the radio before, so I'm going to bring it up again.  You actually said once that you cried on your wedding night.  Well, it was like a tear of frustration rolled down my life.  I wasn't sitting there blubbering.  No, you weren't bawling, but you pretty much realized.  I was laying there so frustrated and pissed at myself and like, son of a bitch, this sucks. 
[01:39:00]  On your wedding night.  Yeah.  I felt it was something I had to do, was to get married.  There you go.  And to show you what a go with the flow, leave things alone, status quo kind of guy I am, that went on for nine years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just, I'm in it.  God, I might as well stay in it.  Jesus.  Fuck it.  Yeah. 
[01:39:30]  A lot of fun.  We got a little song from Stephen Lynch.  Hush.  Hush, little girl, sweet, sweet baby, don't cry tonight.  Daddy's here, and he'll sing you a soft lullaby tonight. 
[01:40:00]  Why can't it all be like it was before?  How can I explain why mommy's not here anymore?  Cause daddy likes porno and ten dollar whores.  Daddy gets wasted, daddy gets wasted, daddy likes robbing against little boys on the bus. 
[01:40:30]  I think that's why your mommy left us.  I think that's why your mommy left us.  Hush, little girl, there is no reason to fret tonight.  Tonight.  Tonight.  Tonight.  Tonight.  Tonight.  Tonight.  Don't mind the smoke. 
[01:41:00]  Daddy just wants to forget.  Tonight.  Soon it will all be like it was before.  Any minute she will walk through that front door But daddy plays poker and drinks lots of beer

Mm-hmm  All right, a couple more calls before we take a break Dominic what's going on?  Yes, hello.  That's a bad Dominic Barber impression.  Believe me, I know the voice. 
[01:43:00]  Mr. Cumia.  Yeah.  Perhaps if you spend less time with Groucho and more time with your wife.  He's got no material either, Opie.  I know.  He's got a bad impression and no material.  Wow.  Let's go to Virginia.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, boys?  Hey.  I just have one thing to say.  After seeing what my brother went through in his divorce and what Anthony's gone through  and somebody's taken my life savings, all I've got to say is they never find the body.  Punch that, boys.  See? 
[01:43:30]  A lot of people might use violence.  Wow.  Leo in California.  Leo.  Good morning.  How are you doing, guys?  How are you doing, Leo?  Listen, I just got this XM satellite radio and I started listening to you.  Wait, wait.  When did you start listening?  Oh, about, I think Monday was the first day I installed it, and so it's just a few days.  All right.  And I heard you talking about divorce stories.  I had been divorced about 18 years ago from this woman, and I live in California. 
[01:44:00]  Anybody who's been divorced in California and has children know it's a nightmare.  She still thinks 18 years later she's entitled to 25 cents of every dollar I make.  And I'm in construction, and she used to live about two blocks.  We lived in Orange County.  And she lived two blocks in the courthouse.  Every month I would be inundated, inundated with subpoenas and paperwork that I have to do it.  It got so bad I got sick. 
[01:44:30]  And I was out of work for about six months.  I got really ill.  I thought I was going to die.  What kind of sickness?  Just stress-related?  Stress-related because of the whole, you know, divorce and, you know, child thing and all of that.  And I got behind in my child support.  But in that six-month period they took my license away, attached my wages that I wasn't even making,  went into my bank account because I was honest with them and let them know that I had, you know, a little bank account. 
[01:45:00]  They attached all of that.  I couldn't travel anywhere outside the country, attached all my taxes, and the interest is about 10%.  So the interest grew.  Now, 18 years later, I'm finally just getting through paying off this woman just from the interest I owed her from the child support.  How long were you originally married?  I was originally married for about five years.  Five years.  Eighteen years later, still paying.  Still dealing with it. 
[01:45:30]  Where's the justice?  California is the land of lunatics when it comes to court.  Yes, we understand.  Are you telling this story in real time, sir?  Why did the marriage break up?  Why did the marriage break up?  Yeah.  You know, I think we both decided we didn't want to be married anymore, and it just wasn't working out.  So it was sort of mutual.  Yeah.  It wasn't working out, you know.  So it wasn't like you were, you know, screwing some hot, you know, blonde babe or something,  and she decided, man, I'm going to really turn the screws on this guy. 
[01:46:00]  No, I did that after I got the war.  There you go.  I waited until I was after, but I used to call her the Antichrist.  Because the way she treated me in the courts, I was like, was she sure she was married to this guy that she's talking about?  She made me out to be this real animal.  You know what I mean?  I went to work every day, did what I was supposed to do.  And she did everything in her heart to keep me from the food.  All right.  Well, good luck to you, Leo.  Good luck to you.  There he goes, Leo from California. 
[01:46:30]  Old, long-winded Leo.  What's that?  Ringo Starr.  Ringo's horrible.  Where's he playing?  Brian Park.  Good morning, America.  Ringo.  All right, we missed Ringo.  Whatever.  Ringo.  That's got to be quite exciting for somebody out there.  That's a good opportunity for the assault on the media.  I know. 
[01:47:00]  It's been about a week without an assault on the media.  I'm getting itchy for one, Anthony.  I'm getting itchy for one.  Absolutely.  Let's say hi to Rick in Minnesota.  Rick?  Yes.  How are you guys doing?  Good.  Yeah, marriage is okay until you go through divorce.  Once you go through the divorce there, your wife can be a real nightmare.  Is this Elo?  Thank you, Captain Obvious.  Wow.  Let's go to Rich in Indiana. 
[01:47:30]  Rich?  Hey, how you doing?  Pretty good.  What is he doing right now?  Is he all sweating and hot going, oh, God, I sucked.  Oh, I had like an idea for something and it just went nowhere.  All right, go ahead, Rich.  Yeah, well, I've certainly discovered that the number one reason for divorce is marriage.  Oh, wait a minute.  Ah!  I just had to get that out of here.  Oh, another one reason for divorce is marriage.  That's hysterical. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, now I feel like I heal.  I heal.  I wanted to share my new marriage experience.  All right, go ahead, Rich.  Girl and I had been going with at the time for about a whole year or so.  We lived in an apartment and then decided to get a house, got into a house.  She had a couple of kids.  And when we found this house and I got it by an instant, she wanted me to put her name on the title.  So I left there like, eh, we'll talk about it later.  So after we got it and got my name on the title and everything, about six months later, she was calling me up to ask me if I mind watching her kids. 
[01:48:30]  Well, she goes with her girlfriend, who was messing around on her husband, to this girl's boyfriend's hot tub.  I'm like, yeah.  Oh, that sounds good.  So, you know, figuring I knew something was going on.  And I'm not a jealous type of guy, so I didn't have any reason not to trust her up to that point, mind you.  So I did my investigation, found that, yeah, she was messing around with this little mechanic boy at the place she was working at.  Later on, after trying to give her a chance to, you know, spill it out, I found the boy, beat the piss out of him. 
[01:49:00]  So then I told her to leave, get the fuck out.  And, of course, you know, she's got a couple of kids, and I'm a real, you know, kind of a soft-hearted guy.  So she stuck around for about another, oh, two years later before things finally broke down.  And when I finally got the bitch out of my house, on the way out the door, she looks at me and she says, well, I want you to sell this house, and I want half. 
[01:49:30]  And the near-marriage part of it was way earlier, she wanted to ring.  And I'm like, well, you know, if you want to ring, I want you to quit smoking.  And, you know, she never would.  Did you guys get divorced because she thought you were long-winded?  Well, yeah, kind of.  That's why she didn't marry me.  See, the story's half-tool short.  Too late.  I thought she wanted half of my house.  And cut.  Cut. 
[01:50:00]  That's called cutting the losses.  And end of bit once again.  End scene.  This is what happened.  Listeners kill their own bits.  That's it.  That's it for now, I guess.  They know when the bit should end because they start calling, and you get calls like that.  He was such a bore, I didn't even know that he actually wasn't married.  It was a near-marriage experience.  Right.  All right, Anthony.  Well, there you have it.  That's it for now.  We'll put the old antivorce thing.  The old rage back in the closet for a while.  Yeah, we'll throw that to the side for now, and it'll come out again on another day. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, Norton's pal, Hilary Duff.  Where?  Is now singing at Rockefeller Plaza.  Oh, really?  There she is on the Today Show.  They're like battling concerts back and forth on those shows?  Oh, yeah.  Is that what they do now?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, ABC does it at Bryant Park every, well, Friday, I guess, and NBC does their thing outside their studio.  Oh, yeah.  Jeez, talk about the extreme ends of the spectrum.  Ringo Starr.  Hilary Duff and then Ringo Starr.  Yeah, look at the audience at the Hilary Duff. 
[01:51:00]  All, like, young, young girls.  A place that, where's that story?  A place where Dean Arthur Schwartzmiller would like to hang out at.  Oh, oh, oh, very good.  How's that for a radio segue?  Dean Arthur Schwartzmiller.  Can we go back to the Ringo on this TV?  I want to see if he does any dumb Beatles stuff.  Ringo. 
[01:51:30]  Beatles great.  But Ringo.  I think he, Ringo's like the guy that could never really pull off the Beatles stuff.  He could do, you know, the Ringo Beatles stuff, but.  What a beautiful day.  What a beautiful day.  Oh, no.  Is this yellow submarine?  Ah.  Who wants to hear this?  And we live a life of ease.  A life of ease. 
[01:52:00]  Every one of us.  Every one of us.  With venereal disease.  Sky blue.  Sky blue.  Sea of green.  Sea of green.  They're showing the crowd, and they couldn't be more uninterested.  Come on, please.  Oh, God.  Hit me, baby, one more time.  Look at the audience.  Oh.  They're holding up pictures of a yellow submarine.  Why are they?  What is that?  Why are they doing that?  Stop it. 
[01:52:30]  They're holding up pictures of yellow submarines.  That ABC.  That's upsetting.  That ABC handed out to the audience.  Why would they hand out pictures of yellow submarines?  John Lennon's rolling over in his grave right now.  Like, oh, God.  Oh.  This is what represents the Beatles in the year 2005.  Ringo singing his stupid song, Yellow Submarine.  Poor Ringo.  Paul McCartney can go out there and do, like, the Beatles classics, man.  The hits.  And do them quite well these days. 
[01:53:00]  The guys held up his voice and everything.  And then poor Ringo.  Yes, I was a Beatle.  We all live.  Oh, yeah.  The Beatles songs no one wanted to hear.  Right.  The awful ones.  Hmm.  Do I want to hear Yesterday or Yellow Submarine?  Haunting version of Yesterday.  Hmm.  I'm not really sure which one I'd rather hear when it comes to Beatles songs.  That's horrible.  Oh.  Some people say Yesterday, the greatest song ever.  Ever? 
[01:53:30]  Ever written.  I would definitely put that in top five.  Of course.  Yeah.  It's a well-written song, if Elo must say so himself.  All right.  The obvious.  Before we take a break and get Ben Bailey in here, who finally decided to wake up and  come in and hang with us today.  Let's see.  Jesus.  We're doing a radio show.  Making Jimmy look really good.  Coming in.  At least Jimmy comes in before the show. 
[01:54:00]  Barely.  Might be two minutes before the show.  At least he's here.  California cops.  Molester may have 36,000 victims.  This is impossible.  Of course it's impossible.  63 years old.  Dean Arthur Schwarzmiller.  So let's just do the math.  He's 63 years old.  Let's say he's been molesting, in this case, children.  Let's say he's been doing it for 36 years, Anthony.  How old would that have made him?  He would have started, like, say, 27.  Why 27? 
[01:54:30]  Because the math's easier.  Because there's 36,000 victims.  If he's been doing it about 36 years, maybe took a few years off in his later years.  That would be 1,000.  Slow down in his old age.  That would be 1,000 victims a year.  Okay.  What is that?  That would be about three a day?  About three a day.  About three a day.  Three different children a day.  Sometimes you don't even see three kids a day.  There's something wrong with this story.  You would have to grab the ass of every child you saw.  Just run around grabbing. 
[01:55:00]  You're in the supermarket.  Whoop!  Oh, let me grab his ass.  Let me grab that ass.  I ought to grab her little ass.  Just walking down the street, touching and grabbing and poking in.  Just groping children all the time.  You don't have time to work.  You're just touching kids.  Three a day and you didn't get caught?  Stop.  36,000 children.  A convicted child molester jailed in California may have committed sex crimes against thousands of victims,  police said Thursday after finding computers, notebooks, and meticulous handwritten lists of boys' names 
[01:55:30]  and apparent codes for various sex acts, Anthony.  Codes.  San Jose Police Lieutenant Scott Kornfield described...  Korn...  What?  Kornfield.  Oh.  You're talking about one of his code words.  Described 63-year-old Dean Arthur Schwartzmiller as one of the most active child molesters we've ever seen.  But like we said, he'd have to be walking around constantly just grabbing and groping children.  He's an overachiever.  During a search of his bedroom in San Jose, police discovered binders full of child porn and numerous logs. 
[01:56:00]  Logs.  Period.  No.  Yeah.  With lists of more than 36,000 children's names, mostly boys, and codes that appear to indicate how he abused them, Anthony.  I don't know what kind of codes these are.  At least Kornfield is rational here.  He's saying if one-tenth of these numbers are accurate, we're looking at hundreds of victims in a number of states.  The reason...  Only one-tenth is hot.  The reason we want to tell the world about this is because we believe he's been involved in child molestation in a number of countries. 
[01:56:30]  Wow.  He's a retired auditor for the California Department of Real Estate.  Arrested in 2004 at LAX, I guess, upon returning from the Philippines.  Oh, boy.  Authorities said they found about 150 sexually explicit images.  Is this somebody else?  Yes, that's a different case.  Ediberto Deton, 61.  Oh, okay.  Oh, yeah.  You've jumped way ahead to a... 
[01:57:00]  Sorry.  I went over the...  In a separate case.  I went over the highlighted area.  That's why they help us with the highlights.  I went out of the highlights.  What is this case, then?  Yeah, why...  Is this guy that came in second?  Who is this?  This is the silver medalist.  Yeah, underage boys.  Oh, this is another guy that was sentenced Thursday to 17 years in prison and lifetime supervision.  Admitted to traveling to his native Philippines, having sex with eight underage boys. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, but that's just sport in the Philippines.  He returned from the Philippines.  That's just...  Yeah, that's like...  I don't know.  That's just good clean fun.  Going to Florida and going to Disney.  That's just good clean fun in the Philippines.  It's like going to Arizona and going to the Grand Canyon.  Right.  You just go...  You're there.  The authorities said they found 150 sexually explicit images of 18 teenage boys in his luggage and digital camera.  Dude, I think a lot of people can relate to this one.  We all know people, okay? 
[01:58:00]  Some of you are even listening to this program right now, and you tell your friends...  That what?  You tell your friends and your family that you're going to Thailand.  You're going to the Philippines.  You want to check out Vietnam and go into one of those foxholes and see how claustrophobic  it was and take in the local f...  Ah.  F...  And flavors.  And we, who have to sit there and listen to these stories, we have to make believe that you're really going there for the tourism.  No, you're going there to get cheap prostitution and most likely touch boys. 
[01:58:30]  With underage boys.  Young boys.  There's someone we know calls from time to time and says how he's going on another trip to Vietnam or Thailand.  Because it's such a great place to go.  Yeah.  It seems like such a fun place to go.  Year after year after year.  I'll almost buy it that, you know, you go once.  Yeah.  Almost.  Barely, though.  Because out of all the places you go in the world, you know, Vietnam is not on my list. 
[01:59:00]  You better have had a pretty long resume of trips that you've taken before you go to Vietnam.  Oh, yeah, because that's what happens, too.  Like, you don't just go, I don't know, Atlantic City, Vietnam.  Right.  Because you're going there for a reason.  Maybe if you've been taking trips abroad.  I'm a little bored with Greece.  Right.  Maybe I shouldn't say Greece.  That's another place you go to.  But you might be right.  If you've been taking, you know, a different trip every year for the last 20 years, you're running out of places that you want to see before you die. 
[01:59:30]  So, sure.  But anyone that's going back there twice?  Yeah.  Stop.  The only time you should be going there is if you're a family member of somebody that was downed in a chopper and you're looking for body parts to bring home.  That's it.  There's so many times I'm biting my lip like, I want to tell this person, you really want me to believe that was the reason you're going there.  Is there anyone else you're talking about but Oedipus from BCN?  Is there anyone else you're talking about?  Because if you know two people. 
[02:00:00]  Like I said, I think.  Is there anyone else on your list?  There are people in our lives that announce that they're going to the Philippines or Thailand and they announce they're going for a reason that is not the truth.  Yeah.  That's all I'm saying.  All right.  If you don't want to name names, that's fine.  I have no idea what you're talking about, Anthony.  You still talk to these people.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  That's fine.  But it comes up from time to time and you're sitting there like, you're not fooling me, dude. 
[02:00:30]  You're just not fooling me.  Stop.  Go tell somebody else.  Did the Goodyear blimp crash?  Did you want to take in the countryside?  Wow.  Goodyear.  It crashed where?  Yeah.  The Goodyear.  Is that really a crash or it's just like a slow deflation?  It's the most uneventful crash ever.  It's crashing and you can just videotape.  The guy was videotaping the whole thing.  I think he had to change tapes.  It's just like, it's going down.  Here it goes.  You know, if that was filled with hydrogen, this would be really exciting. 
[02:01:00]  But it's helium.  There it goes.  It's slowly deflating like a kid's balloon after a couple of days.  The pilot's waving to us.  It's a boring crash.  When did they move Grand Canyon to where?  Arizona.  Sausage King.  Anthony, I want to know when they moved the Grand Canyon to Arizona.  All right, ass fuck.  Where is the Grand Canyon?  Colorado.  You are the dumbest son of a bitch on the face of the earth that you know nothing about. 
[02:01:30]  Colorado.  Young of.  Colorado.  That's where the Grand Canyon is.  I believe it's Arizona and then part of California.  No, the Grand Canyon is in Arizona.  There's a part that's in California.  Someone help me.  No.  No.  Anyone?  Not California.  Anyone?  Any?  But some may sneak up into what's up there.  Utah?  Is Utah up there or is it that other? 
[02:02:00]  Look, man.  I think on the far left of the Grand Canyon it kind of starts in California.  It's not as impressive.  But it's just.  No?  Grand Canyon is pretty far away from the California border.  Is it?  No.  Punch it up.  Take a look.  I know a little bit about everything.  I don't know everything about everything.  I'm not saying it's somewhere where you want to visit, but I hear things and I hear maybe part of it's in California.  Yeah.  But you've been there. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, but I was in the Arizona one.  The Arizona part.  You were?  Yeah.  This guy went to Thailand.  Let's go to Joe.  Hey, Joe.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  You guys are great.  That's how it is.  But anyway, I wanted to see.  My wife.  I wanted to talk.  My wife.  Wait, wait, wait.  What?  Yeah?  Your phone stinks.  Wait, hold on.  All right.  Joe, call back when you get a better cell.  I'm sorry.  He went to Thailand with his wife or something.  We'll get the story later. 
[02:03:00]  Frank on Whack Bag.  What's up, guys?  What's up, Frank?  Nothing.  All those rubes you see on TV.  Yeah.  I seen them at 5 o'clock this morning when I was delivering the papers on 42nd Street.  All them jerk-ups.  They were walking around carrying the signs in.  Oh, the cheap yellow submarine signs?  Yeah.  A lot of them must have made them up at home or in their hotel rooms, and they carried them all up.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  And also, Grand Canyon is in Nevada, too.  Yeah, a little piece of Nevada.  I mean, that's what I meant, Nevada. 
[02:03:30]  It goes up by Lake Mead National Recreation Area is up there.  Yeah, of course.  It kind of goes in.  Anthony, don't show up.  All right.  Thank you, Frank.  I'm watching out.  I'm not faking out anybody.  I'm looking at a map is what I'm doing as we speak.  And Grand Canyon is...  A little Utah, too, I believe, right?  No.  No?  That's not what I see.  The Grand Canyon is in Arizona. 
[02:04:00]  The Grand Canyon, as we know it, is in Arizona.  I understand that.  But it's not just all of a sudden a stream and the Grand Canyon and then a little stream.  Right.  It's, you know, a part of it is a part of the river that made the canyon is in Nevada.  Okay.  The little tip of Nevada down there.  That's it.  Okay.  A little more geography lesson.  But Nevada, very close to California.  The border is on California.  See?  See how I could have been confused? 
[02:04:30]  I like this separation game we're starting to play.  Of course.  So I'm not that off.  Whatever works, right?  All right.  We're going to break.  We'll get Ben Bailey in here.  Yes.  We've got Lounge Against the Machine here as well.  They're going to perform for us today.  We like these guys.  They used to perform at the old joint.  The old jernt.  So we'll give them some time.  As we go to break, it's Anthony's Wedding Planner.  Check this out.  You're getting married. 
[02:05:00]  No, no.  Here's Anthony from the Opie and Anthony show to help you plan the perfect wedding.  I'm talking to you.  Are you listening?  First, you must carefully choose a wedding ring for your gal.  I went into one of those jewelry stores in Penn Station, and I think I spent, um, 300 bucks on it.  Right.  Well, you should also make sure your betrothed gets along with your dear, sweet mother.  Your son is a scumbag. 
[02:05:30]  Eh, maybe not.  Your wedding night, on the other hand, should be a magical one.  I believe, uh, I laid there looking at the ceiling with tears of, of regret and sorrow rolling down the sides of my face.  Just follow the simple steps, and you'll have the perfect wedding.  Just like, and, eh, I got nothing.  I was shocked.  I was horrified.  I was broke.  Hopeless.  What did I get myself into? 
[02:06:00]  It only took nine and a half years for me to leave.  Never marry a wife!  I was a broken, beaten man.  And I had been married for six hours.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the only day of violence.  I'm exhausted.  I just, I have to get this off my chest quickly.  Uh, the news has gotten me scared shitless.  Seems a Massapeco couple out on Long Island, and their son were, uh, awoken early Monday morning by two armed robbers, 
[02:06:30]  who locked them in the bathroom and ran away with their cash and jewelry.  Nassau police said.  Nassau County, Long Island.  So they're telling, um, they said that late at night, they enter the homes through an open window or an unlocked door,  something like that.  I don't think they've been breaking anything.  And, uh, tying people up, locking them in a room, and robbing them.  So now I, I can't sleep.  I, I'm not, I'm serious.  I cannot sleep now.  I was up every hour last night. 
[02:07:00]  Here's what you did, dude.  What do I do?  You have, you get the advanced alarm system, which will wake you.  And, uh, you guys, uh, sleep in one area of the house.  And I know a guy in porn who does this.  This might sound crazy.  Get yourself a gun.  Yeah.  Get a gun.  Keep it in your room.  And, uh, if anybody breaks in, you pull your pistol out, man.  You're gonna, cause the alarm will alert you that they're there.  There's no way they're gonna get anywhere near your room.  Before I can pull out the heat.  Before you can pull out your pistol, man.  Lay down some lead.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  You pull out a pistol, get night vision goggles. 
[02:07:30]  As crazy as that sounds.  Yeah, that's the balance of the lambs.  Why not?  Shut the lights out.  Put on the night vision.  I'd rather swing like a Mossberg, just in case there's a couple of them.  I don't want to have to be a, I don't want to have to be, uh, good with a, uh.  I say you get a single shot.  Get a shotgun.  That's what I mean.  Get a nice Mossberg riot gun.  I say you get a panic room.  I'm, I'm loving the idea of a panic room where it just metal slides down in front of the  doors and windows of my bedroom and I'm just in there going.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. 
[02:08:00]  I don't care what you take.  It's all insured.  Go ahead.  You want to get me?  Okay, look.  I'll open the door for like a second and then I'll shut it again.  Here we go.  And, no, I'm not going to open the door, idiot.  I'm in here.  You can't get me.  Where's the DVD?  Where's the DVD player?  N-word, N-word, N-word.  Oh, no, you didn't.  N-word, N-word.  Oh, no, you didn't.  Just, oh, please don't steal the mazuzas from the door. 
[02:08:30]  What's the mazuzas?  I'll tell you how to refine it.  Get a gun.  Yeah, how are you going to solve this problem?  I am going to get a Mossberg pump shotgun.  There you go.  And keep it.  Because you know what I have right now?  The only weapon I have besides my bed right now.  No.  I have a rapier.  I have a sword.  It's not even real.  It's probably one of your online ones, you mo.  No, it's a very good one. 
[02:09:00]  Hold on, you.  Put on your wizard hat with the start on it.  I'm going to cast a spell.  Look, I've rooted him.  He cannot move.  I'm a level 70 and he's still kicking me in the balls and duct taping me.  This isn't right.  What level are you?  I didn't see your character available when I signed on.  Level 357.  Oh, I see.  Avast.  Have a...  Get a shotgun.  These premises.  A vat.  Lest I run ye through.  What a faggot. 
[02:09:30]  When you taste my steel, homin' vader.  Yeah, I'm going to get in a sword fight.  I'm Errol fucking Flynn.  He'll tie you to the radiator with the fucking thing that closes your robe.  Your wizard robe.  Oh, Christ Jesus.  European Anthony's.  The virus is spreading.  European Anthony's show.  XM 202.  Longer than that.  Oh, good.  Good evening. 
[02:10:00]  You guys just want me to start singing?  No, good morning, Richard Cheese?  No, good morning, Richard.  I'm sitting at home with my dick on hard, so I got the black book for a freak to call.  Picked up the telephone and dialed the seven digits, said,  Yo, this RC, baby, are you down with it?  I arrived at her house, knocked on the door,  not having no idea what the night had in store. 
[02:10:30]  I'm like a dog in heat, a freak without warning.  I have an appetite for sex, cause me so horny.  Oh, me so horny.  Oh, me so horny.  Oh, me so horny.  Girls always ask me why I fuck so much.  I say, what's wrong, baby doll, with a quick nut?  You can say I'm desperate, even call me perverted.  But you say I'm a dog when I leave you fucked and deserted. 
[02:11:00]  My dad'll be disgusted when he sees your pussy busted.  Your mom'll be so mad if she knew I got that ass.  I'm a dog in heat, a freak without warning.  I have an appetite for sex, cause me so horny.  Oh, me so horny.  Oh, me so horny.  Oh, me so horny.  Everybody sing along, won't you?  Oh, me so horny.  Oh, me so horny.  No one sing along, for God's sake.  You said it yourself, you like it like I do. 
[02:11:30]  Put your lips on my dick and suck my asshole, too.  I'm a dog in heat, a freak without warning.  My appetite is sex, cause me so horny.  Me so horny.  Me so horny.  Thank you. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  Thank you so much.  Yeah.  Wow.  Bravo.  Richard Cheese in studio.  What's up, Richard?  Oh, man.  Good to see you, Opie and Anthony.  Thank you so much.  Good to see you.  This is such a nice place.  This is so much better than the dive you used to play in.  Yeah.  We are so glad.  Place was a dump.  It was.  And thank you for all the pictures of the ladies.  This is lovely.  We got quite a collection started here.  Quite a collection.  It's lovely, beautiful starlets and singers.  Yeah, this is good. 
[02:12:30]  How long have you been in this room?  About a, almost, well, in October, it'll be a year.  It's so cute.  They built this room.  Fabulous.  They did, didn't they?  It's your room.  There's a big Opie and Anthony sign.  This whole place is going to be ours out there.  Really?  Doesn't it have a feel and a smell that says the Opie and Anthony show?  It's mostly the smell.  Yeah.  Mostly.  Not so much the feel.  Sorry about that.  Let me just say, speaking of feel, how about these guys, the band?  I brought the kids in.  The whole band.  On the bass, Gordon Brie.  Play a little bass there, Gordon.  And then on the drums, Mr. Frank Fetta, everybody.  And on the piano, the great Bobby Ricotta, everybody. 
[02:13:00]  Pickle in the Ivories.  That's right.  And I'm Richard Cheese.  Thank you so much for having me in.  We didn't even get practice.  We just walked in and started singing.  It was set up, and you guys were playing, and you're singing within three seconds of  actually setting everything up.  That's right.  Very Vegas.  Very live.  Very swinging, late-night show.  We're very excited.  And Richard, you've got a new album out, huh?  I do.  You know, it's a brand new CD.  It's called Apertif for Destruction.  I love it.  And it's available in stores everywhere, and at iloverichardcheese.com. 
[02:13:30]  And also at iTunes, which is good, which sort of helps the motherfuckers who like to  download the music illegally.  This gets them a head start.  It's already been formatted into a tradable, burnable format.  So thank you.  Great.  I see you sell thongs.  I love dick.  Yeah, I've got some, actually.  I was hoping there'd be a bevy of hot female producers on the show.  Yeah, well, it's around, and I'm exactly 100% wrong on what I saw.  Yes, you're wrong.  These are the hot thongs.  These are great. 
[02:14:00]  We're smart.  I love dick.  We're smart.  If we knew that there were hot women all around all the time, we would never do a good radio  show.  So we had to sacrifice that part of our lives.  Well, yeah, that's why they're not here.  The show is really good.  The show is really good.  That's how many women there aren't around here.  Seriously, I've not seen this many dicks since this morning when the band woke up in bed  next to me.  And that'll happen.  Seriously.  Get a chick in here.  One girl would be nice.  Can we get a listener to drive down?  One girl?  Remember the old days when there were chicks coming in? 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, calling all whores.  Yeah.  Well, we could get some girls down here to get their I love dick panties.  That'd be good.  You think that'll work?  Sure or why not?  Absolutely.  It's a size two.  So someone medium, you know what I'm saying?  Well, you haven't seen our listeners.  Yeah, now you're asking for a lot.  You might want to staple two of those together.  Okay, I will.  Hey, can I get a chair for Richard Cheese?  Yeah, why doesn't Richard Cheese have a chair?  Yeah, why doesn't Richard Cheese have a chair?  Yeah, why doesn't he have a chair?  On the planner, doesn't he?  We should say hi to Ben Bailey, too, who has entered the festivities.  Ben Bailey finally woke up. 
[02:15:00]  How you doing, man?  I'm doing good.  You came in?  Yeah, I was stuck on the train.  It's the life of a comic, right?  Oh, stuck on a train.  Sure you are.  Yeah, of course you are.  I only would have been a half hour late if it hadn't been for that five-minute delay on the train.  That darn train.  Don't you love when you're late for work or something?  Because I used to do this, too.  You wake up, you're real late, because I would do that all the time.  You drive to work, and you do hit some weird traffic thing that only takes about five minutes to get through,  but it gives you the reality of the excuse, because now you walk in and go, 
[02:15:30]  ah, traffic, I hit it with an accident or something.  And you're not really lying.  You have some motivation for your acting when you go into the boss.  Yeah, you can actually deliver it and make it believable.  Yeah, a little more believable instead of,  I can't believe the traffic today.  Rachel, you've come back.  It was truly awful.  Lucky I made it at all.  What I can't stand is when you get somewhere and you had trouble getting there,  and by the time you finally get there,  everybody there is an expert on why you had a problem getting there. 
[02:16:00]  You're like, oh, I was stuck on the train.  Oh, you can't take the train at this hour.  You fool, you should have gotten a cab.  Oh, well, where were you when I needed you?  You know what, I did take the train.  It only took me three minutes, asshole.  I'm lying, idiot.  I overslept.  I'm lying.  I'm a liar.  You're stupid.  Good.  Let's say hi to Fred in Brooklyn.  Fred, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Tell him, Fred.  Hey, I was watching that Dawn of the Dead,  and out of nowhere came that Richard Cheese song, The Sickness. 
[02:16:30]  That's right.  We did Down with the Sickness.  Give me a little Down with the Sickness, boys.  Isn't that great?  Yeah, this is a great story.  The director of the movie, Dawn of the Dead, he was listening to the CD on the set,  and one thing led to another, and they said, let's put that song in the movie.  And they paid us.  They actually paid us a couple grand or something like that.  Really?  And for every DVD that sells, we get, I think it's nothing.  We get nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  So that's pretty good.  But it was great exposure.  We got some good fans, including Fred, who, by the way, also a dude. 
[02:17:00]  I don't know if you're keeping track at home.  Oh, if you go with phone calls, too?  It's all actors or guys.  This is a big, yeah, male dick fest.  Well, let me tell you.  It's one big sausage party.  Let's have a dick fest right now with a little Richard Cheese, a little dick,  if you know what I'm saying.  Thank you.  That's me.  I'm complaining and learn to love the cock, Richard.  Thank you.  I might.  As you paid through the Playboy that was right in front of my microphone,  now it's over there.  You show up late.  I'm not sure what happened.  You fucking stole my magazine.  My band is playing a little song by Disturb, ladies and gentlemen. 
[02:17:30]  Do you feel that?  Oh, shit.  Wah-ah-ah-ah.  Wah-ah-ah-ah.  Get up.  Come on.  Get down with the sickness.  Get up.  Come on.  Get down with the sickness.  Get up.  Come on.  Get down with the sickness. 
[02:18:00]  Open up your hate and let it flow into me.  Get up.  Come on.  Get down with the sickness.  You mother.  Get up.  Come on.  Get down with the sickness.  You fucker.  Get up.  Come on.  Get down with the dickness.  Open up your hate and let it flow into me  I can see inside you the sickness is rising  It seems that all that was good has died  Oh no, the Bowery Ballroom which we're playing at on Saturday night is a scary place 
[02:18:30]  Now that you've woken up the demon in me  Alright boys, will you give it to me?  One, two, three, four  Get up, come on, get down with the sickness  You mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness  You fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness  Open up your hate and let it flow into me 
[02:19:00]  Why can't you just fuck off and die?  Get down with the sickness  Fuck you, I don't need this shit, I'm down with the sickness  You stupid, sadistic, abusive fucking whore  Get down with the sickness  Here it comes  Get ready to die  Get ready to  Die  Richard Cheese everyone  Thank you  Uncensored for the first time anywhere on broadcast radio 
[02:19:30]  Isn't that fantastic?  I love richardcheese.com for more information  We should get him downstairs at the Steinway joint again  Imagine that  The Steinway headquarters, Bobby, my piano player, the Steinway headquarters are right next door  Right downstairs  If you go down when you came in the lobby, it's to the right  So we can go down there and maybe jam, play a couple of songs  Well, John Valby might have wrecked that for everybody  Yeah  You know who John Valby is, right?  Mm-mm  You really don't?  I've heard the name, I don't remember who he is  He does  Call him Dr. Dirty  Dr. Dirty 
[02:20:00]  Oh yeah, okay  He's an amazing pianist  Yeah  That just happens to sing really dirty songs  The C word, everything, okay?  He says cunt  Yeah  Wait a minute, you say C word when you're on XM?  How do you?  Yeah, we leave that to other people on the show  Oh, that's nice  It's like an old habit  We're used to doing broadcast radio  Sure, sure  So we still do the initial thing from time to time  So Valby was up here, he didn't have a keyboard  So we told him to go downstairs  Uh-huh  And we asked politely if we could use one of their awesome Steinway pianos  Like, what do they cost?  Like, a hundred grand or something crazy like that?  Yeah, easily 
[02:20:30]  So he started playing just beautifully  And then finally kicked into one of his songs  And just horrified everyone down there  That had their suits on and stuff  Did you bring a microphone down there?  Oh yeah, well we brought a cell phone  Oh, the old days, it was a cell phone  Such good sound quality we got out of the piano  It was hilarious  A hundred thousand dollars Steinway through a cell phone sounds  Just the way they meant it to be heard  If it's a mobile, a T-Mobile  The quality for the Steinway is really good  Is it?  It's got a Steinway setting on it, I believe 
[02:21:00]  That's right  It's got real Steinway tones  Speaking of which, we have fucking ringtones  Everyone's got ringtones  We got Richard Cheese ringtones  If you go to iloverichardcheese.com  You can download them, I swear to God  See, that's a pretty cool ringtone to have  Some of the people with ringtones are like  Why does Newt Gingrich have a ringtone?  Some people, music makes a good ringtone  Can I just say something?  It's good to have you guys back  Am I right?  Thank you, Richard  Because they're funny, am I right, fellas?  Are they funny or what?  The band concurs, I like that 
[02:21:30]  It's so true, you guys, I missed you  Now you're back on the air  It is just a thrill and an honor  And I hope they're paying you  And I hope there's actually people who get the service  Well, they certainly are  How many listeners have you got on this show?  Any idea?  How many people are on XM these days?  Well, I think listening to our show, I think we're up to about 180  That's pretty good  That's about right  XM has well over 4 million subscribers  I was just at XM's headquarters in Washington, D.C. the other day 
[02:22:00]  You were down there?  I was down there, I saw the big sign  It says 4 billion served  4 million served up on top  Yep  And it's a nice facility  When we signed with these guys a little less than a year ago  It was like 2.1, 2.2  Really?  That's pretty good  It's growing that fast  I'll go out on a limb and say they've almost doubled it  I don't know how you do the math so fast like that  But thank you  Slow down  It's early in the morning  I like to show off like that every so often  Richard, the next time you come by  You see all those cubicles?  They're going to be gone out there 
[02:22:30]  There's a bunch of sales weasels out there right now  They're all leaving  And we're going to have a nice performance area  No kidding  And we're going to have a poll for the ladies to do their thing  We're going to build a stage  A poll  So when the ladies strippers come in  And they bitch about having to take their clothes off  Like they do now  We could actually put them in the work environment that they're used to  Where they feel they could take their clothes off and do the poll act  Can you feel at home if Norton's here anyway?  Well, I think Norton scares him sometimes  I love Jim Norton, by the way  I met Jim Norton for the first time on this show  And now I see him all over 
[02:23:00]  He's fabulous  He's blowing up  He's in Texas  Well, we're here all morning for you guys  We'll play as many songs as you want  And do not plug my CD anymore  Oh, no?  Because you've already done it once  And that's all I need  I just want you to know  I'm here for the love  And for you guys  Where can people get the CD that we're not plugging?  No, I really don't want to talk about it  I'm not even going to do it  You're not going to tell people where they can get it?  Absolutely not  Look at me, not even doing it  Where's the website that you don't want to give out?  I'm not doing it  This is my sincere love for you guys 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, right  I'm not here to sell  I'm here to care  Come on  But seriously, you guys want to play another song?  You want us to play a song?  Yeah, let's play another one here  And by the way, Bobby Ricotta, Tickling the Ivories, through the whole segment  Make sure you play The Tired yet?  That's so impressive  Make sure you play some of the dirtier stuff  Well, that's all we're here for  I would love to do  I'm looking at my CD  What's the dirtiest song on the regular set?  How about we do a little Nine Inch Nails for the kids?  Oh, nice  Start it up for us there, buddy  I mean, Frank  Is this going to be just like the 
[02:24:00]  Old drummer name?  I get confused  I know what song it is  Is this going to be just like Johnny Cash's version of Hurt?  Oh, man, how great was that record?  Start it up for us, boys  That was a wonderful song when he did Hurt on the American recordings  Yeah, this is almost as good as Johnny Cash  Little Nine Inch Nails with a taste of Sesame Street built right in  Oh, yeah  Here we go to that  Love this tune  Thank you, fellas  You let me violate you 
[02:24:30]  You let me desecrate you  You let me penetrate you  You let me complicate you  Help me, I broke apart my inside  Help me, I've got no soul to sell  Can you hear the bass okay?  Oh, yeah  Help me, the only thing that works for me  Help me get away from myself 
[02:25:00]  I wanna fuck you like an animal  I wanna feel you from the inside  I wanna fuck you like an animal  My whole existence is flawed  You get me closer to God  He's beatboxing, ladies and gentlemen  Oh, wow  You can have my isolation 
[02:25:30]  Bass  You can have the hate  That it brings  Beatbox, I had  You can have my absence of faith  Piano  You can have my everything  Singer  I wanna fuck you like an animal  I want to feel you from the inside  I wanna fuck you with an animal  My whole existence is flawed 
[02:26:00]  You get me closer to God  God!  Thank you  That was, uh, Frank Fett on the drums and the beatbox  How great was that?  He does that with his mouth  That's amazing  Let's call his girlfriend and have her describe what he does with that  When he's not playing at the gigs  What else he can do?  She's asleep  Well, that hasn't stopped opening Anthony before  I love richardcheese.com 
[02:26:30]  Thank you  I love it too  Hey, by the way  And you got a gig in New York?  Yeah, we're playing Saturday night at the Bowery Ballroom  And it's sold out though  But you guys are welcome  In fact, everyone on the staff who's a girl and opening Anthony can go  Wow, that's rough  Sorry guys, but seriously, sex change operation, anything  Please, just a woman  Any woman  But, uh, I know that, uh, I don't know how long you want us on the air  But I do have a topic that I'd love to talk about  Yes  At some point, that involves me swearing a lot 
[02:27:00]  Oh yeah?  Because I'm very angry about something  And this is the only radio show  Well, vent  Go for it  That's what it's about  This is the platform that I've been waiting for  But I need to take some water  Can I get some hot water for tea?  Hot water for tea?  Because, you know, I need to bring in  My throat hurts, uh, from all the time  What the hell happens to us?  It used to be all about the booze  Well, you know, I talk  It's a little early  By the way, congratulations to Boston  What happened over there?  Uh, city?  New York may be America's most intoxicating city  But when it comes to pot, Boston and Boulder are on a higher level  Cack, cack, cack, cack 
[02:27:30]  All the college towns  They said that all the college towns  Which is a big surprise  Yeah  This is pretty sick, actually  According to a new government study  12.1% of folks in Boston  And 10.3% in Boulder  Uh, reported smoking marijuana in the past month  12%?  That's what they're saying  Wow  That is a lot of people  12.1% of Boston  It seems low  It seems really low  Low?  Low?  I'm thinking high  Like 60%  You gotta think of like  I'm thinking high  But that includes  Doesn't that number include like children? 
[02:28:00]  Like infants and the elderly?  Yeah, I mean, slow down there  That's everybody  I'm sure if you said of college age  It would be higher than 12%  It's more or less  1 out of 8  In Boston  Smoking the dope in the past month  1 out of 8  Remember Smoke 2 Joints?  Or math  Give me a little rhythm and give me a C  1 out of 8  I guess that's a lot  Yeah, that's a lot  You gotta figure some people didn't admit it 
[02:28:30]  That's true too  Uh-oh  We got a song pertaining to your fabulous music  Great  Oh, alright  According on the bass  It's awesome  Smoke 2 Joints in the morning  I smoke 2 Joints at night  Thank you, okay  That's all we know  It was very timely though  What we make up for with the quantity  I've heard that song  Yeah, we used to do that live  But, you know  The potheads in the band left  So we don't have the legal right to do it anymore  Yeah, is this a new band?  It's a brand new band 
[02:29:00]  We've got a new bass player  New drummer  And the new piano player  And oddly enough  The original piano player  Is in town today  In New York  Really?  Out of Chicago  And the other piano player  Who fucking sucked  Oh, wow  Is also in town  Doing a very plum gig this morning  With the Hilary Duff band  Was on TV?  Yeah  This morning  I think it's on whatever that  Good Morning America  Today Show had him on  Today Show  Is there a little friction?  There's always tension  In the Richard Cheese organization  Are you tough? 
[02:29:30]  Are you like a tough  I'm a pussycat  Do I pay you guys well or what?  Because I'm thinking  Come on  I'm thinking we got another Paul Anka over here  Let's talk about Paul Anka today  I've heard the Paul Anka behind the scenes tapes  And maybe you're like that  Did you really?  Are there Paul Anka tapes?  You haven't heard the Paul Anka?  Oh my god  You don't hear this fucking scumbag  Going to go to town  He just put out a new CD  That is in direct competition  With the Richard Cheese Empire  Absolutely  And that's one of the things  I was going to ask you about this 
[02:30:00]  Because you've been doing this  A very long time  And now you've got these guys  That can't sell records anymore  And decide this is a way to go  And they found a niche for themselves  Out of nowhere  I just  So it's like Paul Anka  Old school guy  Doing exactly what you're doing  Richard  He just put out his new CD  Which is called Rock Swings  Not as clever as  Lounge Against the Machine  No  And it's got Smells Like Teen Spirit  On it  Which we do in our act  It's got  What's the other song on there?  Do you have that Paul Anka CD up there?  Yeah  Dedicated song  The problem is  There's no humor involved  In the Paul Anka stuff 
[02:30:30]  And there's a couple songs on there  He should do one of his songs  Yeah, he shouldn't be doing it  Oh, do a Paul Anka song  You should do a version of one of his old songs  Having My Baby  You should do a little Having My Baby  Or you should fuck him like an animal  Having My Baby  Thank you  But I just found out he sold  Don't play his fucking CD while I'm here  Just read the titles  Just read the titles  I was going to play it to show you  How bad it was  Oh, I heard it  It's horrible  I mean, it's great  I want to hear his outtake  If you like shitty  Alright, no  We'll play his outtake  You haven't heard Paul Anka yelling at his band?  Oh, I'd love to hear that  Because that's what I need  That's the ammo I need  To turn the country away from him 
[02:31:00]  Because we sold a thousand of our CDs last week  He sold 8,000 in his first week out  Son of a bitch  I know  And he took  Well, they got these old Paul Anka fans  That think they're going to get something  That they enjoy  Richard, you sound so angry  I'm bitter  You know what I am?  I'm bitter  I'm going to record my own backstage tapes  But I don't yell at the band  I yell at someone else's band  What happened with the keyboard player?  Oh, I'll tell you that story  It's a good one  Oh, here's the Paul Anka CD  Hold on a second  He did Eyes Without a Face by Billy Idol  Yeah  Which is what we were working on for the next album  He did Love Cats 
[02:31:30]  Which we do  And Black Hole Sun  He stole that  Stephen Eadie did that five years ago  Stephen Eadie did Black Hole Sun  That's right  I forgot about that  Fuck you, Paul Anka  Yeah  Hold on  He does Wonderwall by Oasis  You know any of those, Bobby?  Yeah  Screw him  Screw Bobby  Yeah  No, I'm just kidding  I love you, Bobby  But now what happened?  You had a falling out  Because I noticed it's a whole new band  The first keyboard player  He left because he was married  And his wife was in Chicago or something  And he was too far away  So he moved home  So we let him out 
[02:32:00]  So I got this new guy  We auditioned this new guy  His name was  I don't want to say his name  But it rhymes with Gorin  Okay  And he showed up in the band  And he was slick  And he was cool  And he did a couple shows with us  And then one day  You know, we've got like 10 shows booked in August  And in July  He calls me and goes  Hey man  Gordon, do your impression of his voice  Yeah, because we're all going to know  Yeah, it's phenomenal  He goes  Hey man, listen  I got a gig with Hillary Duff's band  I got to go 
[02:32:30]  I'm going to be his touring  You know, their touring musician  I can't turn it down, man  I'm like  Okay, well  You know, I got 12 gigs booked  What are you  What am I supposed to do?  So he just left  And he also got paid for his last gigs  And I didn't have to pay him  And I paid him all his gigs  Why did you pay him?  I thought he was going to reimburse me  For the airfare  For the gigs that we had booked  He didn't do a damn thing  Look at the tension going on  I'm telling you  In the lounge against the machine 
[02:33:00]  But luckily  As soon as he did  We got this new guy, Bobby  Yeah  Whose name also Bobby Ricotta  Total coincidence  And he's really good  And he's on time  And he hasn't bailed on me  For any tours  Is that correct?  Still in the band  Really good  And also  He looks black  Which helps  Well  I think it's more  I'll go Hawaiian  Yeah  Well he is  But if you look in the CD  He totally looks like a brother  And he's like  Giving us so much cred  Cred  Some street cred  Some street cred 
[02:33:30]  So thank you, Bobby  For staying in the band  Oh, there's the CD  That's pretty good  Something tells me, though  You wield an iron dick  With the band  I'm not that bad  I think you're probably  I'm not that bad  I mean, the first bass player  He might have done something  With a girl in a hotel room  In Vegas  Oh, well  That might have not been  To her liking  Oh, Jesus  All right  It's a bad room service  I would assume  No, no, it was a  I don't want to talk about it  Because I think I'm not allowed to  But he had to go 
[02:34:00]  He had to go  Or he had to go  It was him or the band  Going to jail  You know, when those allegations  Rear their ugly heads  Sometimes you just got to  Cut your ties  Or the band going to jail  That's what you want to hear  The band and the whole  Richard Cheese thing  Going into the tab  Wow  That would be  Actually, it would probably be good  You could put out  A prison album  Like Johnny Cash  Lounge against the machine  We really would like to play  In a prison  If someone over at Rikers  Could just book us  There you go  That would be a pleasant gig 
[02:34:30]  I got fucked up the ass last night  You know  I read an article  Hold your repertoire  Those guys in Rikers  And God bless them  I'm sure that they're all  On drug busts  Which are totally stupid  They use their own feces as a weapon  Right  I have heard this  That is a sweet  How do they do it, though?  They put it in their mouth  And spit it at the guards  Nice  I'm so serious  Why would you have to  Put it in your mouth?  Couldn't you just throw it at the guards?  Well, I think they want the propulsion  And the surprise factor 
[02:35:00]  A lot of surprises  Coming out of his mouth  Yeah  Yeah, you might  If the guy raises his hand  And wind up  You might be able to  Duck out of your way  But if you're just looking  At some guy in the face  And going, hey  Hey, boy  Of course, it's like 1920s  On a chain gang  What am I doing?  Hey, boy  What you doing in there, boy?  What we have here  Is a mouth full of feces  And he just spits it out at you  Now you've got trouble, right?  That's dedication  That is dedication to the act right there 
[02:35:30]  Remember that great song by Pat Benatar?  Give me an B  Oh, a B  Stop using shit as a weapon  Thank you  I'll be here all week  Paul Anka's going to record that tomorrow  Fucking Paul Anka comes out with a CD  The week after mine  He sells eight times as many CDs  And he's online  Fuck Paul Anka  I'm calling Letterman's show  Every week for six months  Hey, you've got to have us on  We're funny  Dave will like us  The whole Letterman band loves us  Will Lee plays on our fucking CD  Really?  He played bass on American Idiot  So I call up the booker 
[02:36:00]  And I'm like  Hey, we do lounge versions  Of contemporary rock songs  And they go  Oh yeah, Paul Anka's on  This Wednesday doing that  Son of a bitch  How about going to Jay Leno?  Ah, Jay Leno  Very, very funny man  Uh-oh  Oh wait  No, I won't do that show  Oh, boy  Now that's Jimmy's favorite  It's loyalty  Jimmy was just on Jay Leno  Jimmy Norton  Jimmy Norton is just on  Like two days ago  On Monday, actually  Was that his first time on there?  Second time  And then he sat down with Jay  That's very nice  And had a great long conversation 
[02:36:30]  Cracking the audience up  And making pedophile remarks  About Hilary Duff  Who was sitting next to her  Hilary Duff coming up a lot today  Look, Hilary Duff  Oh, she's on right now  What is with Hilary Duff?  She's on the Regis  And what the hell is that girl's name?  Jenilee Harrison  Jenilee Harrison  I don't know which one  Of the Janits or Chrissies  That she is  I don't know  Which twin were you  In that TV show?  That is an excellent Regis  I love it  That's a very good Regis  Well, it is  You've got to just  Plug your nose  And yell at everything  I do an impression  Of Edward G. Robinson 
[02:37:00]  I'd like to do  For everybody right now  It's from the movie  Key Largo  Can I have a drum roll there, Frank?  Alright, let's hear this  Edward G. Robinson  Addressing Humphrey Bogart's character  Who formerly served in the military  Edward G. Robinson  About to be shot  But he knows  So he's trying to cut a deal  With the character  And here he goes  Soldier!  Soldier!  Soldier!  Thank you  I'll be here all the way  Edward G. Robinson  Wow!  I felt like I was there  Wow, I had my eyes closed 
[02:37:30]  And it was just like it  It sounded like Richard Cheese  Doing a bad Edward G. Robinson  Why isn't Hilary Duff on our show?  She's doing the press junket  In New York  She's doing everything  She looks good  She sure does  She's lost over weight  Hey, let's go to the phones, Anthony  Because we were talking about shit  And Jeremy has something here  Jeremy in Jersey  Go ahead  I love this show  Hey, what's up, boys?  God, the piano playing in the background  Just mellows us all out  I love it  I love it  Keep it going  Keep it going  Nice  Go ahead, Jeremy  Some shit music, Bobby  Listen, you've got to get a recording  And that shit dick song  So you can cover that 
[02:38:00]  Next time he comes in  The shit dick song?  Have you heard the shit dick song?  No, I'd love to hear that song  Yeah, see?  We have the shit dick song  We haven't played this one  In a very long time  Is it about ass?  You think you guys could work up a version of this?  If, uh, in a few minutes?  Sure  Our faithful listeners would just love you  We got time this morning  Love you  Can we get some headphones for my good friends Bobby, Frank, and Gordon?  Wow, that would be  Are you insane?  You have headphones?  What, is this a radio station or a satellite network?  It's, uh, yeah  It's a work in progress  Still a radio station?  This is, uh  I had trouble getting my own headphones 
[02:38:30]  That's how they are around here  You got pop screws  Oh, wait, these guys want to hear the songs  Well, they're going to need to hear it at some point  No, we can do it  We can play it  We'll turn off all the mics  And then it'll be on the studio  In the studio, okay, that's good  And then maybe you guys leave the studio  And try to work up a quick version  And our  Bobby's so good  He could probably write it up in  Really?  Spot  Here's shit dick  You want to explain shit dick, Anthony?  It's from, uh  Oh, there's, um  Panzerfaust Records  Uh, Panzerfaust Records  They have disbanded  Yeah  Uh, because they  They were partners that ran  Pander, Pander Faust Records 
[02:39:00]  And one of the partners  Found out that the other partner's mother  Was Hispanic  Uh-huh  And since Panzerfaust is a white supremacist  Uh, label  Right  Uh, this kind of shook up the corporate world  Over there at Panzerfaust  A little bit  Which is really funny  When you think the guy probably was so nervous  Keeping this secret for so long  Yeah  Uh, Panzerfaust, yeah  Uh, Eric  We're going to need someone to get the lyrics for these guys  Immediately  So that'd be great  They've got to transcribe  They only handled white supremacy  Uh, uh, racist, homophobic, uh, bands 
[02:39:30]  That would sing these songs  And, uh, this song, Shit Dick  Is about the homosexual community  Perfect  And some of the, um, some of the celebrities  Uh, uh, that are homosexual  And how this guy feels about them  I'm looking for new material for our new Greatest Six record  See, and this is something I don't think Paul Anka is going to cover  And this could be one of those B-side things  That, uh, some of these artists do  That really takes off  One of those obscure songs that you just happen to have  Yeah, let me tell you about Paul Anka  The hidden track that's not listed  I'm very angry about Paul Anka  Don't say his name anymore 
[02:40:00]  No  Because it totally angers me  You just said it  Oh, fuck  The P word  The P word  It is the P word  We have audio of Paul Anka losing his mind  We'll play for it  I can't wait  Because I can put that on my website  And say don't support  Yeah, listen to this guy  This raving lunatic  We'll give you a copy  He yells at his band  Like they're animals  There's a Great Buddy Rich recording  Yeah  Great Buddy Rich doing that on a bus  And I love that track  Because he, uh, he says  You fucking guys  I could  I could play better shit out of my ass  And you hear a bus engine 
[02:40:30]  Through the whole tape  It's so good  You hear that  It's so good  Alright, here we go  For Richard Cheese in the band  Alright, this is shit Nick  And we're going to cut the mic  This is one of our faves  You can pick it up  We're always trying to find ways to play this  This is it  We always try to find an excuse to play this  Lovely little ditty  Shoot Nick  We hate all 
[02:41:00]  Shoot Nick  Andy Warhol  Shoot Nick  Mick Jagger  Shoot Nick  Shoot Nick  Michael Jackson  Shoot Nick  Shoot Nick  Jeffrey Dahmer  Cannibal  Shoot Nick  Shoot Nick  We hate shit dick 
[02:41:30]  But slamming shit dick  Boy  George  Shoot Nick  Freddy Mercury  Shoot Nick  David Bowie  Shoot Nick  Rob  He's in free  lava 
[02:42:00]  Music  Siege  Holland  Susan  Christian ides  Kim  Things  Son  Herbert  Engel  Freddy  Krueger  Ton  He's down to sea  Fuck you  Truman Capote! Richard Simmons!  Rod Stewart! Richard Deere! 
[02:42:30]  We ain't the funky shit-dicks! The funky shit-dicks! You're sick, sick, sick!  Goddamn it. I love that song. That is so good. We love that thing. We haven't played that in a long time.  That's really good. Yeah, we can work up a little... You can work up a version of that, Richard?  You know, lounge-ify it. Give it a little more swing class. 
[02:43:00]  Richard Deere, butt gerbilin' shit-dick. We don't have to do it now. I don't have the lyrics yet, but let's see.  Let's tease the quarter-hour. The lyrics are star-studded.  What we'll do is we'll take a break in a little while. The band, you know, leave the studio.  You work it up a little bit. Maybe hear the song again in Steve's studio, and then we'll come back and do that.  Yeah, we'll totally do that. That's good.  Hey, uh, Hawk, where are you getting those lyrics?  You just typed those up? On the fly. From memory?  I think you missed a couple, but he did a very good job. That's very cool.  I'd like to volunteer to do the fart noises. Yeah, that'd be awesome. There you go. 
[02:43:30]  But we need you to do them not just like the original song. You need to sort of lounge your fart noises out.  All right. And by the way, as a song guy, I think, and by the way, what a great title for myself, Song Guy.  That is a really well-constructed song. Isn't that good?  Because they didn't just repeat shit-dick over and over again and throw names in there.  They built a real song. They had a verse, and then there was a bridge, and there was a turnaround, and there was a refrain.  And then they did that double time with the call and answer. Right, right. 
[02:44:00]  That's a great song. Isn't it good?  What's the name of the artist?  Who did that? We just know they were on Panzerfaust records.  I'd love to find out. A little racial problem.  Every time we sing a song, you know, we play a royal record company.  Yeah. Well, Panzerfaust was an anti-tank weapon that the Nazis used to use back in the day.  Back in the day. I know. And by the day, I mean the 40s. Back in the day. Back in the good old days.  Back in the good old days. When we was hanging in Poland and shit. Back in the day, G. 
[02:44:30]  We was blitzkrieging all over the Europe. Y'all beat. Yeah.  I don't ever laugh when I do these radio shows because all the rest of the DJs in the United States suck.  And you guys are funny. Richard, thank you so much.  Thank you so much. You don't even know because I'm on a hundred radio stations all the time.  I can only imagine. We were just on Z100 and those guys are sweet. I know these people for a long time.  But it's regular radio too. It's regular radio. They're not hilarious like this. It's so very nice.  We hope we can ruin it for regular radio. Yeah. I hope so. Did they play shit dick? 
[02:45:00]  Oddly enough, they did. But it was Shakira's version. Let me tell you though.  That is sexy. It's sexy because, you know, music is an entity unto itself.  I'm quoting Shakira out of the USA today.  Remind me, speaking of Panzerfaust, I also have a Nazi record label story about my old label that I want to tell you guys later.  Really?  You think I hate Paul Anka.  Well, we got Paul Anka clips for you.  Oh, I can't wait. I gotta tell you about my old record label, Oleo Records. 
[02:45:30]  Let me get that spelling right. Oleo?  The slander and libel suit can be very active.  Why have I heard of Oleo Records? Who else was on there?  They put out a lot of independent stuff. They put out the Richard Blaine flashback.  With Jackie Martling? Yeah, Jackie Martling was on Oleo Records.  Yeah, Jackie Martling was on Oleo Records. I remember him always hawking his wares.  Let me tell you a little story about that label. Do we have time now?  Sure.  What time is it in real time, by the way?  Uh, it is five minutes. Now, if we save the time during the replays, it is about six minutes to the hour.  Five chills? To the hour. 
[02:46:00]  To the hour.  And there's no Arbitron, is there?  And there's no commercials. We just stop when we want to stop.  There's no nothing. There's no ratings. There's no accountability.  Right.  There's no nothing.  There's just XM's money.  I was just thinking, we've got to get into that five-minute till break.  No.  We can get in the news at the top of the hour and do the legal ID.  Hatred of shit, dude.  Oh man, I love this.  Wow.  Hatred of shit, dude.  Well, the old record label, when I first did this Richard Cheese album, this first label 
[02:46:30]  bought my first CD for $7,000.  Seven G's?  Seven grand to record the entire album.  Seven large.  16 songs for seven grand.  $500 or less per song.  And at the time, were you psyched, thinking, hey, I'm making money with my music?  I'm thinking I'm going to be on a record deal.  I'm going to have CDs in every store.  I'm thinking this is going to be huge.  Right.  And I did the whole album with just a couple of guys and musicians, and it worked out great.  He put the thing out.  This is Deja Vu, by the way. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, I know.  I was about to...  Go ahead.  No, no, no.  You go.  You first.  And then we'll tell the exact same story.  Oh, good.  Well, it gets so much worse than, I think, any other horror story I've heard in the music  industry.  So, he put out the CD, and it sold maybe, you know, 5,000 copies, and he just stopped  doing anything about it.  I go out there, and I start working it.  I come into New York.  I go on the O.B. and Anthony show when it was on FM.  Those were the days.  And then we sold CDs, and we were promoting, and it was great.  And then he calls me up and says, hey, we'll do a second record. 
[02:47:30]  We'll do your second record for the option.  Uh-huh.  Now, my contract said the option was 15,000 for the next record.  All right.  I'm like, great!  15 grand.  I'm making double as much.  I can do it twice as good an album.  And he goes, no, but I'm only going to give you 7,000 for the second record.  I said, but the contract says 15,000.  Did he pull the legal term contract schmontract?  He did.  It was so much better than that.  That's hard to get out of.  He said, I know, and my lawyer said to him, argument?  And he said, argument schmargument. 
[02:48:00]  That's what happened.  God, I hate that legal jargon.  I know.  So he said, no, I'm only going to pay you $7,000.  Take it or leave it.  And I said, but the contract says you have to pay me 15,000 if you exercise the second option.  I said, you know, he said, well, then I won't exercise the second option.  And he walked away.  Release me from the contract.  I'm like, okay, fine, you asshole.  Then I'll go put out my own CDs.  So I put out toxicity, my own CD.  And it went well.  Thank you.  I said to him, look, I'm going to put out my own CDs. 
[02:48:30]  Are you cool with that?  And he said, sure.  He said, I'll write you a letter that says you're free and clear.  Uh-oh.  He writes me a letter.  You can use Richard Cheese.  You can say the name.  You can run the whole CD and do what you want without obligation.  So I put out toxicity.  Great.  I put out I'd like a virgin.  I'm holding this up for the radio audience, by the way.  I see that.  I have two CDs out.  They're independent.  And I'm thinking to myself, you know what?  RichardCheese.com is his website right now.  I should own that.  Absolutely should.  Who should have OpieandAnthony.com?  Well, we had a fight for our website. 
[02:49:00]  Yes, we did.  You did?  It took a good year.  And you won, right?  Yeah.  Because you can't fucking not be Opie and Anthony and own it.  An anti-fan had the site.  I'm kind of getting some thing here because I see your website as I love RichardCheese.com.  Exactly.  And not just RichardCheese.com.  I mean, you can't imagine how much I enjoy saying those extra two syllables a hundred  times a day.  And people coming up to me going, hey, can I go to your website, RichardCheese.com?  I go, no, don't go to RichardCheese.com because he set up his website.  By the way, I love Bobby playing beautiful, lovely music behind my horrible legal nightmare. 
[02:49:30]  He has RichardCheese.com just selling the first CD and no information about my other  CDs.  Now you don't get them.  It's nice of you to plug it for them.  Do you get any money?  I barely get any money from that CD.  Yeah.  And so anyway, I've been fighting him to get RichardCheese.com back.  And I said, look, man, I'm Richard Cheese.  Right.  You told me it was okay for me to put out Richard Cheese CDs.  I have a trademark on Richard Cheese now.  Maybe you should shorten your name to Dick.  Well, I got DickCheese.com.  Oh, you got DickCheese.com right?  DickCheese.com. 
[02:50:00]  I called this porn guy in Florida who owned DickCheese.com and I said, hey, man, look,  you're not using it.  It just forwards to CyberFoxes.com.  If you pull up CyberFoxes.com, pull up DickCheese.com on there and look what comes up.  Opie, read that if you see it.  DickCheese.com.  All right.  I love this guy.  He was so nice.  I don't have BenBailey.com.  He's the real BenBailey.com.  See?  Really?  BenBailey could be another guy.  It's a British, some guy in England.  This is so great.  This is hilarious.  You go to DickCheese.com, Anthony.  It says, welcome to DickCheese.com. 
[02:50:30]  If you're looking for lounge singer Richard Cheese, click here.  If you're looking for top-notch explicit internet porn, click here.  I split this DickCheese.com with this porn guy.  He was so nice.  That's hilarious.  That is pretty cool because now two people are sharing the same link page.  That's right, and he gets my traffic and I get his.  Isn't that great how you're working together?  Exactly.  And that's a really...  Can we play We Are The World for this?  Hold on.  This is a tough decision though, Richard.  It's like, do I go to the lounge singer Richard Cheese or get top-notch explicit porn? 
[02:51:00]  I don't know which one to do.  I guarantee you everyone does the porn first.  They go right to the porn page.  Absolutely.  They get their rocks off and then they're like, what was I doing again?  I'm looking for Richard Cheese.  I've got a couple extra minutes.  I've got to click on this.  Richard, our story really fast.  We put out a CD called Demented World.  Sold well over 100,000 copies.  Oh my God, that's great.  We maybe saw 10 grand each, maybe.  We got so roughed on this.  Maybe.  I don't even think we saw that much, right?  No, no.  And then the guy decided to stop... 
[02:51:30]  Well, go ahead.  He decided to stop paying us at all.  Wow.  All of a sudden, all these CDs are out there.  He just stopped paying us.  And know why he decided to stop paying us?  Because we were bitching on the air for a year that we weren't getting paid.  So we started bitching about it on the air.  He finally calls us up and goes, I heard you bitching about me on the air.  He said, yeah, well, we haven't been paid.  He goes, well, you know what?  Now you're not getting paid.  Oh my gosh.  But he stopped paying us.  So you're not going to pay us?  Even though you haven't been paying us, now you're really not going to pay us. 
[02:52:00]  These shysters.  Please tell me you've sued him.  No.  No.  Why not?  You can get a lot more dough out of that.  I'll sue him for you.  You know what I say?  Sue Shmoo.  I went to high school with her, by the way.  Huge fit.  Some Asian girl.  She was beautiful and quite a slut.  We knew that we were in trouble with this guy, Richard.  Sue Shmoo.  He was representing Bozo the Clown.  Right.  But not the original Bozo.  That's a big contract.  Not the original Bozo.  Not the original Bozo the Clown.  But does he have the real website? 
[02:52:30]  He was trying to be our agent as well.  So he was bragging with these stories of people he knows and things he's done in his past.  He actually told us a story.  You know the song Na Na Na Na Hey Hey?  Sure.  Do you know who sings that?  I do.  It's a very obscure band.  It's got an S in it.  Yeah.  One Hit Wonder.  Water Vapor.  Sweet or sweet or...  Steam.  Steam.  No, no.  Steam.  That's right.  It is Steam.  He claims that he... 
[02:53:00]  Wait.  I think I got...  It's Steam.  This guy who wanted to be our agent...  What is?  Steam.  ...was telling us that he was in the studio while this band was doing this song but they  didn't have a name.  Uh-huh.  And he saw...  He saw Steam.  And it was this long, stupid manager-agent type story where they go into these long-winded things  It takes forever.  So I saw Steam coming out of the radiator and I said, why not call the band Steam?  And they went, what a great idea and, as we know, the name of the... 
[02:53:30]  Shut up.  I was with a manager one time and he's telling us this long story about how this other manager  he was with, they were fighting over clients all the time and this one manager turned down  this one client and he signed her to a contract on a napkin, a cocktail napkin in a bar and  they signed the contract and do you know who that artist was?  And now we have to...  Now it's a game.  We gotta sit...  Um...  Uh...  Hart? 
[02:54:00]  No.  Uh...  Pat Benatar?  No.  Yeah.  Panzerfaust.  No.  And you're just sitting there going, could you just say this so I could go home?  Oh, that's awesome.  The artist was Cindy Lauper.  Oh my God.  Wow.  Wow.  That's fantastic.  How about that?  I love that.  I heard Scott Shannon this morning on the PLJ doing a story about which starlet has herpes.  They were doing the mystery question today.  The answer is D.  All of the above.  Yes. 
[02:54:30]  Interesting.  Although I was just like, wow, Shannon is getting...  Get the post.  That's the blind item in the post today.  They had a couple good ones.  Exactly.  They had a couple good ones today.  Even the same guy was trying to get us to sign a 5 year contract in the middle of a food  court in a mall.  Without a napkin.  Because he wants another story for next time.  With a big...  And I was in a food court and I signed it on a root beer napkin.  I signed and that was Opie and Anthony.  He brought...  And remember he brought his muscle with him, that big scary black dude?  Yeah.  Brought a big black guy with him.  It was almost like you will sign this contract.  That's awesome.  Anyone could sit in an expensive office. 
[02:55:00]  I use food courts and pass the savings on to you.  How many people could claim a deal in front of the Shinnebun?  Yeah, right?  Try the chicken chow mein here.  It's wonderful.  To finish the story...  Only the free samples.  Yes, sir.  Just to finish the story, the reason we were in the food court, when your food has toothpicks  stuck through it.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, you're dining inside.  Look, hors d'oeuvres.  To finish the food court story, we put out this Dementor World CD, Richard, and we toured.  We kind of toured the CD.  We went to...  The signings everywhere, all over Massachusetts. 
[02:55:30]  We were...  We went on that mall tour.  Right, right.  We went to all these malls and record stores, and no joke, there was a few that...  We were there all day.  Six, seven hour signings.  Unbelievable.  And we're just thinking ka-ching, ka-ching in our heads, because we weren't making any  money, and this is like home...  We're finally gonna make some cash for, you know, with what we do.  So, he wasn't paying us, and we finally meet in the mall at the food court, and now he's  gonna give us some of the money.  He's gonna give us our checks.  So now we're like, on the way there, me and Oprah going, this is great, finally we're  gonna get money.  This motherfucker better have ten grand, at least ten grand each for us. 
[02:56:00]  And that would only be maybe, you know, part of the money.  Part of the money.  And it's like, at least, in good faith, it better be a check for ten grand each.  Uh-huh.  This guy was like selling t-shirts and posters and counting the cash in the back corner.  Oh, man.  Oh, it was all cash.  He'd sell these posters and t-shirts.  We didn't see one dime.  He'd be in a corner, and you just see his arm moving in here.  And you know he's not jerking off.  He's out just wads of cash, and we never saw a dime one.  Looked up every once in a while.  Keep it up, boys.  Keep it up.  Keep going, boys.  Keep going, guys.  Good work. 
[02:56:30]  His big green-stained thumb.  Thumbs up.  Yeah, you son of a bitch.  He's got pictures of, like, friggin' Benjamin Franklin on his thumb from Counting Hundreds.  We were just happy to be there, because, you know, I mean, this is huge exposure.  The CD kind of went all over the country, not, you know.  But, I mean, but a few here, a few there all over the country.  It was exciting, you know?  Yeah.  So we had nothing?  He didn't have a check for anything?  Oh, he had a check.  I think it was for a grand each.  A grand each, yeah.  One thousand dollars each.  He slides it in the envelope like a big money deal's going down.  Like a ransom for a hostage thing is slide back. 
[02:57:00]  A suitcase of cash.  And a thousand bucks he slides up.  And we are like, this son of a bitch.  And he wanted to sign us at that moment.  You know, hey, guys, here's the contract.  A five-year deal.  Like, dude, you just stiffed us, and we're gonna now sign with you?  Which item from the food court you get a thousand dollars every six months?  Yeah, yeah, every six months.  I know.  I was ready to take my, uh, dry veggie burger.  Yeah, who knows what it was, but it was so sad. 
[02:57:30]  I went to high school with her, too.  Oh, dry veggie burger.  Big tits.  Asian.  Also Asian.  Alright, so where are we at?  We got the Paul Anka clips for you.  Oh, I want to hear Paul Anka.  I can't wait.  You guys want to hear Paul Anka.  Listen to this scumbag.  Paul Anka just losing his mind.  How he treats his band.  You guys might have flashbacks.  I'm sorry, here we go.  Paul Anka yelling at his band.  The light at times of your life.  What is that blue doing over there on, all the way to the middle, and then you shut  it off?  What is that all about?  That was a fuck up.  That was a fuck up.  If I see that again, you're gone with the rest of it.  Is that clear?  That's just the way it is around here. 
[02:58:00]  You understand that?  That's how fucking crucial this is.  That's how fucking crucial this is, is my new catchphrase.  That's how fucking crucial this is.  You got his amp in the wrong setting?  Yeah.  You got that turn to the middle.  Yeah, what are you doing?  It was actually something to do with, I guess, the way the lights he was pissed at.  I don't remember on that one.  He was pissed at the way they came in and out of songs.  And he threatens their jobs.  Well, here's the one where he puts them on fucking notice.  You thought, you thought, you thought, you thought eight things tonight. 
[02:58:30]  You're on fucking notice, John.  I gave you a list.  Get half a list that I gave you.  We're choosing everything on it.  Okay?  The guys get shirts.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  The guys get shirts.  You understand?  We're not going to be as strong as our weakest link.  The guys get shirts.  The guys get shirts.  Shirts.  I chewed out Frank for losing one of our tiger stripe ties, but he found it.  Yeah.  And everything's fine.  He's still in the band. 
[02:59:00]  Did you chew him out, though?  I didn't change that it was that fucking crucial.  You're on fucking notice.  But yeah, your guys wear ties.  God, that's awesome.  This one's really good.  Listen to this clip.  Now, guys, I'm giving you all one week to get this together.  Okay?  I'm giving you one week to play that music that way it's supposed to be better.  I'm giving everybody one week. 
[02:59:30]  everybody's got one week to do it right  because I'm in my form right now  you guys are not going to come up  and support me with the enthusiasm  I've got for it  it ain't going to work  I'm the only important one on that stage  and you are letting me down  do you understand that?  I don't get it  I don't get it  do you understand that?  I'm the only important one on that stage 
[03:00:00]  and he's the only important one  I need to start being an asshole  see?  that is why he sold 8,000 CDs last week  because he's an asshole  doesn't that sound like a lot of fun though?  just getting up in front of a group of people  that are supporting you  and just treating them like shit  I love it  well I'm staying in this business  it must be a treat  we have one more clip  one more clip worth playing  because he asked them if they like their jobs  now we're all important in the totality 
[03:00:30]  if you don't care like I care  I don't need you guys to take my money  just like that guy last night  that fucked up my crew  and was short labor  I lost out 20 or 30 fucking thousand dollars  because my crew got fucked  do you understand?  do you understand where I'm coming from with integrity?  that you guys are better at the same thing  because you're all replacing  do you all like your jobs?  do you want your jobs?  do you?  then you better protect his  because if that happens again  he does not have that job  do you understand? 
[03:01:00]  you better make it life  the band gets shirts  you don't know how crucial this is  do you fucking like your job?  wow  see I like that  do you fucking like your job?  I like the new Richard Cheese  well done  I love Richard Cheese  my crew fucked me for 20 or 30 thousand dollars  do you not understand integrity?  right  I think I got it  I think I got it  thank you guys  thank you Paul Inca  for giving me a reason  you could go off with that Hillary Duff bitch 
[03:01:30]  oh jeez  use that one  I actually did yell at him  that was good  but he's out of the band  you can yell at him as you're firing him  you want to hear  slice like a hammer?  this one's pretty good too  oh absolutely  we have millions of them  this will be the last one I guess for today  there is a lot of loose shit going on  and I'm telling you  you guys are thin ice  alright  I'm telling you right now  and when I fucking move  I slice like a fucking hammer  you've seen it?  I'll do it again  when I take you the band  you better look and make sure 
[03:02:00]  everybody sees you when you walk in this room  I will not put up with this shit  you understand that?  oh man  that's just the fucking weight it is  every one of your fucking checks cash  with the amount on it  do any of your checks bounce?  do y'all get full value on your money?  I want full value on your fucking service  do you hear me?  oh wow  what a scumbag  he slices like a hammer  like a hammer  he'll fucking pound you like a pair of scissors  that's what I use  it's like a restaurant  you know what?  when I get a nice filet mignon  at a restaurant 
[03:02:30]  I use a fork and a hammer  I just kind of  and it slices  Paul Anka's right  I never thought it would work  I used to watch SCTV  and there was a character  on the Days of the Week  called Rocco  and he was this dumb hit man  and he'd go  yeah I'm crazy  crazy like a snake  it's bad idiom  we failed to consider the possibility  that maybe the band  is just awful  yeah I know  we were sticking up  behind the band  maybe they were really bad  just fucking everything up  he legitimately has a reason  to yell at them 
[03:03:00]  it's a bunch of like  12 year old kids  in a high school  junior high band  sitting there in their briefs  they pull back  and he's yelling  at all these kids  in an orchestra  kids are crying  junior high  I like his cliches  that he uses too  when you sit there  and you're yelled at  a guy that's saying  you're on thin ice  and we're only as strong  as our weakest link  it's like you're getting  cliches thrown at you  stop it  a bird in the fucking hand  is worth two in the bush  I have no idea  what that means Paul  yeah fuck you  well get your shirt  it means shut up  get your shirt 
[03:03:30]  you know a shirt  has two sleeves  and a neck hole  and you could all be  leaving out of one of them  what Paul  some of them have buttons  too  yeah buttons  and I'm buttoning down  this stage show  and trying to make  as many shirt references  you know don't make me  collar you and  those checks are cash  for the amounts  that are written on them  legal tender  not a penny more  not a penny less  god that is awesome  I am so relieved  because you know  when I came in here  this morning  I was thinking  I hate Paul Inca 
[03:04:00]  I hate Paul Inca  but now I feel sorry for him  don't you feel sorry for him  and now it's okay  that he needs that money  he's been riding over here  thinking I hate Paul Inca  I hate Paul Inca  the whole time  I hate Paul Inca  and I hate Olio Records  I hate Paul Inca  I hate Olio Records  now you can vent  this is addicting though  we gotta play another one now  please  he talks about Jesus Christ  in this  Jesus  the only satisfaction  I'm gonna get  is to you and your  fucking asses  like the coach of a ball team  or any god damn business  till you get it  understand that  because if you don't feel 
[03:04:30]  embarrassed about it  and you have no conscience  you have no heart  you have no integrity  do you understand that  then all you do  is you take the fucking money  and you've got no substance  remember that  people of substance  and character  care about what the fuck  they do  and they fix it  okay  and I think you're  working with me  because I think  that's the way you are  and I don't pull  any punches  when you guys  I am telling you  that his jaw  is on thin ice  and you know how fast  I move  I don't care  if you're a light man  a production manager  an agent  or a theater owner  like last night  you understand  I have a new philosophy 
[03:05:00]  I don't care  if it's Jesus Christ  he'll fire Jesus Christ  this guy will fire Jesus Christ  remember when Jesus Christ  got fired that time  it was sad  it was so awful  because he was always late  and he'd use that excuse  about the subway  you know  you know what the saddest part  is watching Jesus  at unemployment  sitting there with the woman  going  did you try to be  the savior today  I showed up at Paul Anka's  rehearsal without a shirt  but he's Jesus  he doesn't have a shirt 
[03:05:30]  Jesus hasn't worked since  I want to know what happened  between Paul Anka  and his ball coach  you gotta ream your ass  like a ball coach  like a ball coach  in 6th grade  that makes you go home  and cry at night  curl up in the shower  in the fetal position  his little league coach  was fucking him in the ass  that's why  like a ball coach  oh man  alright one more  we gotta do one more  you gotta stop  one more  don't make me a maniac  it hurts my face to laugh  now we're all important  to this fatality  if you don't care  like I care  I don't need you guys  to take my money  just like that guy 
[03:06:00]  last night  that fucked up  my crew  and was short labor  I lost out  twenty or thirty  fucking thousand dollars  because my crew  got fucked  do you understand  do you understand  where I'm coming from  with integrity  because you're all  replacing  do you all like your jobs  do you fucking jobs  do you  then you better  protect his  because if that happens  again  he does not have  that job  do you understand  and you better  make it right  if you don't do  the job  you're gone  and that goes  for everybody  that's just 
[03:06:30]  the fucking  way it is  because you gotta  do good  and as long  as you got it good  you gotta make it good  get it fucking right  that's just the way  it is around here  do you hear me  you understand that  don't make a fucking  maniac out of me  there you go  too late  there you go  it sounded like the same clip  but everyone has done it  when you're arguing  you say the same shit  over and over  over and over  all right  Paul Anka  make a fucking maniac  well that solves  all my problems  because if I can get  that recording out there 
[03:07:00]  I think that'll  dip into his sales  and bring up  the Richard Cheese  TV sales  Richard this is what  we're gonna do  he's gonna make me  think what the fuck  I did over here  fucking Paul Anka  you motherfucker  keep him here  keep him here  no shirt  you understand  where I'm coming from  with integrity  if that came from  a mafia boss  everyone should be scared  but it's Paul Anka  what can he actually do  they refer to him  as the bat  the bat  because he looks  like a bat  he's got that tux on  and the collar  seems extra high 
[03:07:30]  he's all tan  and dark hair  looks like George  Hamilton  a bat  that's hilarious  alright this is what  we're gonna do  when we get back  from break  we'll do shit dick  we'll do shit dick  we want you guys  to hear it again  just to make sure  you got it  it seems like you do  but just to make sure  but as we go to break  why don't you do another  track off your new CD  there  it's ILoveRichardCheese.com  it's a little tune  by my good friend  Green Day  don't wanna be

[03:12:30]  Shinnecock Indians  Shinnecock  shiny cock Indians  I love that  actually there's  a whole tribe  but female ones  the Shinnecunts  that are even more vicious  they are  very traditional  and they will  take your money  yes  Shinnecock Indians  yesterday fired  the first arrow  in their battle  to reclaim  ancestral lands  filing a federal  lawsuit seeking  the return of  3,600 acres  of prime real estate  stolen by the state  a century and a half ago  how will they do it  considering actually 
[03:13:00]  giving it back to them  because the area  is really in need  of rain  you can't have it  but you can  dance there  whenever you want  it truly is  another non-story  but basically  they just need to  smoke a peace pipe  about this  that's it  relax a little bit  oh my god  now I'm thinking  of F Troop  all I can think of  is Crazy Cat  and when he goes  it is  Balloon  oh I loved  F Troop  last show  the end of the  Civil War 
[03:13:30]  was near  and quite  accidentally  I don't know  the words  thank you  almost  close enough  just get the band  all started  we do know  a couple TV teams  and I'd like to do  one this morning  is now a good time  or should we do  this other one  why not  we do have  Richard Huff  on the line too  here  oh we do  we have a little  business with this  guy Richard Huff  he's now our  favorite columnist  in the daily news  yep  Richard Huff  hey Richard  hey how are you 
[03:14:00]  what's up Richard  howdy  so far so good  love the  your latest piece  I just want to  show Richard  this is why  Richard Huff  is our favorite  oh I just saw  you have a big  write up  that's fantastic  another big  write up from  Richard Huff  and this one  to fill people in  the first thing  Richard Huff  did on us  about a week  or two ago  was it  last Friday  was a piece  on this assault  on the media  that we're doing  that has resulted  in one  reporter being  fired  Arthur Chien 
[03:14:30]  from CBS News  he got fired  because he  one of our pests  came up behind him  with an Opie and Anthony  sign during a report  he thought he was  cut away from  thought they went to  tape  turned around and said  what the fuck is your  problem man  to the guy  and he was actually  on the air  so they fired him  and our fans  take these signs  find the live shots  going on around the city  and hold up the sign  that is a lovely  likeness of you guys 
[03:15:00]  on the sign  that's very good  and he did a story  on our pests  and how they've been  doing this  and how it's  annoying to the  reporters and what not  and we kind of  unloaded on Richard  a little bit  and then we talked  to him later in the  show that day  and found out  he's a pretty fun  guy and stuff  and has a sense  of humor  and we talked  to him about  how these listeners  that do this  we refer to them  as pests  because our listeners  are indeed pests  if you do something  that annoys them  whether it's 
[03:15:30]  people that are  enemies of the show  or us  they will be pests  to us  they attack us too  Richard  they're like mosquitoes  in your ear  on a summer evening  when you're trying  to go to sleep  pests  so Richard did  a great story  about how  these pests  do this  and how many  letters he received  and emails  and how the pests  handled his story  and it's really  a funny piece  Richard  I gotta say  well thank you  did it with a lot  of humor  yeah the headline  is 
[03:16:00]  one fan  send pest  regards  so I assume  you got a lot  of email  from our pests  we did  I did  and it's funny  because there  were some  were very logical  and respectful  and that sort  of stuff  and then others  just attacked me  as you could see  and I included  some of those  yes  the personal  attacks are very funny  well my favorite  is  you sir  are a balding tool  god  damn  you know what  kind of balls  it takes  to write that  in your own  column about yourself  I know  hey look 
[03:16:30]  the problem  I have here  though  is that  do you know  any young person  that uses  the word  tool  so I think  the guy  probably looks  like me  and that's not  what you want  in your audience  that's the thing  you need to be  concerned about  we've kind of  brought the word  tool back  you have  yeah  we've kind of  been using it  for years  because it's kind  of a fun thing  to call someone  a tool  it's like a  grandmother  yeah  you tool  and at any  W  before we could 
[03:17:00]  really curse  it was pretty much  the only thing  we could say  yeah we had to  find those  insults that you  could say  on broadcast radio  hey you know  I don't take  those things  personal  so it's fun  to put some  of those in  there  and I actually  like the Crisco  line in the  last letter  yeah that's not  bad either  but yeah  I mean they  were all over  the board  some of them  were favorable  most of them  were not favorable  and some of them  just went through  you know a litany  of things  now since we  had our little  love fest  last time  have you been  getting any  letters from 
[03:17:30]  listeners saying  you know  hey that's  pretty good  you know what  I got a couple  and I think I  included one in  there  I believe I did  but there were  literally a couple  that came through  maybe five or six  where they said  look I was pissed  off at you  when I was reading  it but then I  heard you on the  show and hey  you're not half  bad  yeah  you know  somebody said  hey you had  the intestinal  fortitude to go  on the show  or testicular  fortitude I think  was the term  the guy used  and that's true  because a lot  of these guys  will write about  Aunt Nye  and then we'll  hide behind their  article and never  come on the air 
[03:18:00]  with us  you know what  they're pests  Richard  but they're  also puppets  we work them  by strings  it's amazing  all of a sudden  we can hate you  and they'll turn  around and turn  their venom  on Richard Huff  and then we have  a conversation  and go  wow Richard ain't  bad  and they're like  yeah Richard  ain't bad  I'm a brainless  pest  Gary Springer  can fill an  audience every  day too  so  yeah  were there some  comments you  wanted to include  but maybe your  editor or the  newspaper in general  just said no way  could we go with that 
[03:18:30]  well you know  there were just  look I chose  which ones to  include  I mean just some  of them were just  long rambling  things going through  the history of your  show and all this  other crap  yeah they'll do that  there were lots  of just  you know attacks  on the media  itself which  you know to  include some of  that and make it  fun and you know  just didn't make  any sense  yeah  so I tried to  you know a good  cross section  obviously they're  ones that were  just filled with  bad words you  can't use in a  newspaper  yeah I like some  guys will write  about the media  and actually make 
[03:19:00]  very valid points  and sound intelligent  and then other  ones is just  news bad  exactly  great  sounds good  you know why  why can't we  upset reporters  they upset you  know well the  reality is no  they don't you  know you don't  have to talk to  a reporter as I  said in the piece  but so there  were some of  those sorts of  things so you  know now we're  turning it on the  media we're doing  it against the  media as if this  is a gigantic game  we're all playing  here  it's true  you know and  then there was  one guy who sent  like a two page  letter and said  if you use any of  this you can't  edit it so that 
[03:19:30]  immediately cut him  out  oh right because  yeah it would be a  whole piece on  his letter  exactly  some self-important  pest  right you know I  gotta have some  room for my own  big headedness  hey Richard  here's a picture  we want to ask you  about something  you finish your  article by saying  for the record this  is not the first  time I've been told  to find a new  career some of my  colleagues suggest  that often also  Connie Chung yelled  the same thing at me  in 1995 when she  was extremely unhappy  with something I  wrote  gotta fess up to  that Richard  what happened  that sounds like  a good story  it was during the 
[03:20:00]  Oklahoma City  right if you  remember back  the Oklahoma City  bombing situation  Connie was out  there and she  said something on  air and then some  firefighters took  issue with it  I think she was  I forget exactly  what it was she  said but she  pissed off some  folks out in  Oklahoma City  and we had  written about  that and it  was on a  Saturday morning  I'm outside  I'm full of  dirt and whatever  and my wife  comes out and 
[03:20:30]  she's like  Connie Chung's  on the telephone  and my wife  tried to tell  her look he's  busy he's got  his hands full  of dirt and  whatnot and so  she was upset  at that point  so she just  laid in to me  so many things  wrong about the  piece blah blah  blah blah  and you should  consider finding  a new career  so that pretty  much ended the  conversation  boy a lot of  people have  suggested that to  you Richard  well maybe I  need to find  something else  did you want  to call her  the C word  do you have a  tape of her  yelling at you 
[03:21:00]  kind of like  Paul Anka  no no I was  sitting there  standing in my  kitchen getting  yelled at by  an angry news  reporter  well we definitely  enjoy the piece  thanks  very nice  and what else  is going on in  the TV world  I see it's  tube talkers  that's what we're  doing so I guess  it was a slow  day for television  well you know I  had all these  letters I didn't  want to let  this go  you know there  will be something  next week  like a real  column  yeah exactly  anything hot  on television 
[03:21:30]  what do you  think of this  Hell's Kitchen  you know it  doesn't work for  me I don't care  about this guy  yelling at his  people he's just  a little too  over the top  yeah I don't  know why I find  that entertaining  though I kind  of like these  subordinates being  yelled at  you gotta give  Paul Anka one  of his reality  shows him yelling  at his band  that would be so  great  but yeah I  kind of like  that show  I could see  getting bored  with it pretty  quickly though  yeah  like it's got a  pretty short shelf  life  what are you  looking at  that's pretty  good  you know I'm  all over the  place  I think I  mentioned that 
[03:22:00]  dancing show  last week  with the stars  which again  went up this  week  I can't see  it  I don't either  there's a picture  of Evander  Holyfield  uncomfortably  holding a female  dancer in the  paper today  yeah  it's so goofy  it is so goofy  ballroom dancing  part of it  yeah  the hit me baby  still continues  to be sort of  interesting  yeah well we'd  love to play  clips like we have  for the past  couple of weeks  that's one of  our favorite  shows to goof  on  as we're recording  it big time  radio show  as we're recording  it here so we  could play it  today somebody 
[03:22:30]  has been changing  the channel of our  television in our  office  so now we got  like the home  shopping network  taped instead of  hit me baby  one more time  which is fascinating  I think we're  going to get a  copy of that  and we'll goof  on that on  Monday  I love that show  though  yeah and that's  why it's so fun  what about that  30 days on FX  you know it got  pretty good reviews  it's kind of  interesting to watch  you know I saw  the first one  where he goes  and works  for minimum wage  it'll be interesting 
[03:23:00]  to see how it  does down the road  you know what  I'm almost  feeling with this  guy is that  whole Michael  Moore thing  exactly  where he made  the movie that  was a really big  hit and then  it goes to TV  and Michael  Moore's television  show was just  a bomb  exactly  it really bombed  badly and he  did he does well  with the movies  and I think that  might be what  we're looking at  here but I'm  talking on my  yes because I  haven't seen it  well in the case  of Morgan Spurlock  though this show  sort of falls more  in line with what  you know about  what he did  right  you know the  Michael Moore show  is more about 
[03:23:30]  opinion and that  sort of stuff  rather than just  you know a concept  I'd say it was a  little biased too  and one sided  well no doubt  about it  just a tad  and if you don't  agree with the  opinion then you're  screwed  yeah but at least  Michael Moore was  like pleasant to  look at on screen  oh hot  he's an attractive  super hot  and people call me  a balding tool  could you imagine  that made us  laugh so hard  this morning  Richard is that  a recent picture  of you  yeah  alright  no that's good  at least that's 
[03:24:00]  honest and stuff  I'm just saying  some of the people  like who was that  Kay Gardella  had a picture in  there from like  the 50s  I think like  who was behind  her Bing Crosby  or something  behind her in the  picture  it's great when  you see the  picture of the  columnist and  eventually they end  up on TV or  what have you  and you can't  believe it's the  same person  Anne and Dear Abby  used to  because Abby  had a picture  for a short  period of time  I remember  growing up  that actually  looked hot  like Dear Abby's  picture looked 
[03:24:30]  hot and then  she pops up  on this talk  show and you're  like ah  yeah she's got  that stretched  face  a lot of times  that happens  they take the  picture early  in the career  and they never  change it  yep  no that's me  so that's not  true for you  Richard  you are hot  is it a joke  around the  newspaper  do you go  look at this  picture of this  person  you laugh about it  you mean in my  case  no I mean  around other  people's pictures  that you know  are really like  15-20 year old  pictures  and you go  Bill's still  using this  picture or  something  yeah for us  we're just  sort of used 
[03:25:00]  to it  you know  yeah you  talk about it  alright  well Richard  you laugh at  your co-workers  thank you  Richard thanks  for the exposure  we appreciate it  it is a really  good read to the  listeners out there  pick up the  Daily News  today  a very funny  column by  Richard Huff  hey Richard  you should come  see my show  and write a big  feature on me  next week  that goes for  me too  Richard  everyone involved  in the show  you can put me  in my own  buddy  I gotta get  back to TV  guys  we own some  of the guys  at the newspapers  we can't have  them planned stories  run a story on

[03:37:00]  Ugly George is back  we gotta talk about Ugly George on Monday  and uh  hmm  what else  oh the artist apologized  whatever  yeah  that whole big apology  you know what that says  speaks volumes  it says  death threats  it says  legitimate  authentic  scared him  to death  death threats  yeah real fast  the Brooklyn photographer  who tried to recreate  chilling images of 9-11  by jumping from the roof  of the Chicago museum  we talked about this  for a while yesterday  apologized yesterday 
[03:37:30]  to an outraged city  and the families of  the World Trade Center  yeah this guy apologized  the families of the victims  sorry  profusely apologizing  this isn't just people  writing him  or calling him  and saying  I'm gonna kill you  motherfucker  this is  you know when you leave  in your Ford Explorer  at 7-15  in the morning  you know  this morning  when you waved  goodbye to your wife  you know  it's that kind of shit  do you want that whole thing  to end in a fiery explosion  what the fuck 
[03:38:00]  did this guy think  was gonna happen  yeah  what do you think  people are gonna go  hey that's a great idea  hey look at that  yeah let's remove that  a little if we can  he knew what was gonna happen  because he did it in Chicago  he was already hiding  behind what he was attempting  yeah but the attack  he probably got what he wanted  he's on the page of the post  in his words  yeah but you know what  people email me about that  you guys talking about him  is just  you know what  but he has to have talent  to back it up  yeah so he'll be famous  for a week or two  and then he goes away  he goes away  because he stinks  I am extremely  this is his words  I am extremely  extremely sorry  for the families 
[03:38:30]  of the victims  that have been hurt  by this  he said  this is not something  this is not something  I meant to do  I did not mean  to open this up  for any of them  just for him  so  his next project  he wants to help them  relive what they felt  when they heard about  him doing this  so he's apologizing  today  oh that's good  and it looks like  he was scared shitless  I hear he's gonna  light himself on fire  to great white music  and uh  what? 
[03:39:00]  shut up you fucker  you shouldn't have  gotten crickets  Anthony  people  Anthony  turn off the lights  when you're done  what are you leaving?  I'm leaving  my god man  and then uh  really fast  uh  this teenager  who decided  to take a plane  on a joyride  and you're thinking  they're saying  he never flew  a plane before  yeah  we were talking  about this  the other day  saying that  if something  happens in an airplane  and a regular  passenger has to  get in the cockpit  could he possibly  land the plane  a jet  obviously a lot  more complex  and bigger  than a Cessna 
[03:39:30]  which is what  this kid was in  but the principles  are all the same  you know  you pull back  you go up  push forward  you go down  throttle  forward  backward  so this kid  knew how to fly  a plane  and I guarantee you  he used a  Microsoft Flight Simulator  which fills you in  on how to fly  a fucking plane  you will know  all the mechanics  to flying a plane  he just took a plane  he just hopped in  found the keys in it  never flew before  started it up  took off  and landed  a couple of times  yeah here's the story  a filter has offered  him a job 
[03:40:00]  a 14 year old boy  stole a Cessna  and went on a  late night joyride  taking off and landing  twice before being arrested  he crashed the plane  came down hard  the last time  he tried to land  suffered minor  cuts and bruises though  yeah  but he took off  landed  and what surprised me  this was at night  he did this at night  which is even harder  the teen allegedly  took his mother's van  from their home  last night  and drove to the airport  in Fort Payne  about 5 miles away  he said he then  found the key  in the unlocked plane  removed the Cessna's  tie down 
[03:40:30]  started the engine  and began driving around  the next thing he knew  he was in the air  wow that's amazing  the teen whom  police said  had never before  flown a plane  was in the air  for nearly 30 minutes  30 minutes  flying around  and then he lands  the plane  this guy is going to be  a media superstar  he'll be on  Letterman's couch  within a week  I'm sure  within days  within days  but the software  that's out there now  just teaches you  all the mechanics  to fly in a plane  you know  you don't have  the actual experience  of being in a real cockpit 
[03:41:00]  but it really does  it's a real thing  the Microsoft  yeah  and it's very technical  like you really  everything you do in there  is actually on a plane  every instrument  it works the same  as it does  it affects what you're doing  on the computer  like it does  in a real plane  so you could learn  how to fly on those things  how old is this kid  14  14  14 years old  little fucker  just yesterday  he was wearing a helmet  to ride his bike  around the yard  he takes off in a plane  he's got to be  the coolest kid in school 
[03:41:30]  now you gotta think  one minute  alright one more plug there  I'm at Mohegan Sun  tonight at 11 o'clock  check out my website  therealbenbailey.com  and buy a CD  or die  cool  do you gamble at all  at those things  not really  I'm not a big gambler  I would feel  really  I'd be angry at myself  for a long time  if I lost money  you go there  you do the gig  you make some money  and then you lose it  I'm gonna gamble it away  and then kill myself  alright  but I wouldn't throw myself  out of the window  that's inconsiderate  there you go  also Jim Norton  will be back on Monday  he's playing the Addison Improv 
[03:42:00]  in Dallas tonight  through the weekend  972-404-8501  for tickets  I guess we're gonna leave  with another song  from Richard Cheese's  CD here Anthony  the Michael Jackson song  yeah I love  richardcheese.com  if you want more info  about Richard Cheese  these guys might be back  on Monday  but we're gonna leave you  this week with a song  everyone knows  The Girl is Mine  by Michael Jackson  he says there's some  really funny stuff  that only you and I  and our audience  would appreciate  in this song  alright  so let's play this  and we'll see you guys  on Monday
