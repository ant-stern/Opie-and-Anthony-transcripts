<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  It began with a critical, and at times offensive, analysis of New York Yankees announcer John Sterling's broadcasting style, featuring clips of his calls and commentary from the hosts and callers, including Mark from Connecticut, Prozac, Nate, Rugburn, and Brian from Tennessee.  Rugburn suggested a replacement, "Big A," while Brian offered comparative examples of other announcers.  This segment was followed by a similarly unfiltered discussion of the sitcom *Good Times*, rife with offensive racial slurs,  focused on its stereotypical portrayal of a Black family. Opie confessed to a childhood crush on Florida Evans, and an episode involving a union job opportunity was recounted.  The segment unexpectedly concluded with a brief appearance by Tom Morello, Brad Wilk, and Chris Cornell from Audioslave.

Anthony then shared a story about an excessively talkative and eccentric white cab driver and the bizarre thank you card he received.  This transitioned into a segment featuring Patrice Oâ€™Neal discussing a bizarre encounter with an intern and recounting unsanitary conditions from past workplaces. This segment occurred concurrently with a photoshoot and videoshoot involving female guest Friday and also included mention of another female guest, Mackenzie Mack, as well as audio from Andrea Yates' 911 call.

The show then veered into explicit territory with Friday and Mackenzie Mack (from MackenzieMack.com) engaging in sexually explicit activities on a "Liberator" device.  Opie, Anthony, Steve, and Ben provided commentary and instructions while various sex toys were used.  A pop culture quiz for Jim Norton, revealing his lack of knowledge, was interspersed with the sexual activity. Listeners also called in with comments.

Following this, the show played audio clips from Tom Sizemore's leaked sex tapes, with Martini Steve providing commentary. Sizemore's career, struggles with drugs, and a drug test incident involving a fake penis were discussed.  This was followed by a segment featuring "The Rocker," a homemade audition video of a poorly singing but enthusiastic man, and a brief interview with Bo Bridges, who discussed his career, *Stargate SG-1*, his brother Jeff Bridges, acting methods, and the changes in filmmaking. A clip of Celine Dion's emotional Hurricane Katrina reaction on Larry King Live was also played, along with discussion of Sean Penn's post-Katrina actions.

The show continued with further discussion of Celine Dion's Katrina response, interspersed with calls about high gas prices and listener anecdotes about delivery problems, mirroring Jim Norton's own frustrating couch delivery experience.  Dee Dee, a studio guest, brought in a collection of sex toys which were described.  Maury Povich's scheduled appearance was not included in this excerpt.

Finally, the show concluded with a segment featuring Dee Dee, who brought a whip.  Dee Dee and Jimmy, another guest, experimented with the whip, with Jimmy accidentally hitting Dee Dee, causing discomfort.  The discussion included Dee Dee's submissive tendencies, whipping technique, and the resulting marks, all interspersed with jokes from the hosts. Dee Dee hinted at bringing additional sex toys for a future appearance.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Alright, here's the deal.  You want to listen to Troy's mixtape of love for Melissa?  Yes.  Or the John Sterling clips?  What's the John Sterling clips?  I've been so annoyed as a Yankee fan.  I used to love John Sterling.  I thought he did some interesting...  Color calls?  Color calls.  I'm sorry.  But he became a caricature of himself and began to annoy me so much.  I used to love the guy.  I think he actually calls a really good game.  A lot of people disagree.  I think he's very good.  But when he does the home run calls, he gets so wrapped up in his own shtick. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah.  Like, you know...  Like, it's not about you, douchebag.  It is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  At times, if you don't know where the ball's going, that makes sense.  But when it becomes...  It is high.  It is far.  Alright.  Is it?  Is it gone?  Or when the Yankees win one.  When the Yankees, years ago, would win 2-1 in the ninth inning, and he would...  The Yankees win!  It was a chilling call.  It was so good, because you felt the way he...  It was a dramatic moment. 
[00:01:00]  Absolutely.  That he was capturing with his call.  Yes, in the playoffs, but now when they win...  You're talking about a close game.  In the playoffs, maybe.  Right, right.  The Yankees win!  And you're like, yes, they did.  Yeah.  But now it's, you know, an 8-1 win in Minnesota in July.  No!  No!  The Yankees win!  That's great.  You're solid, man.  That is good.  It's like, dude, do you have no emotion for everything?  It's the same amount.  You've got to have a mix.  The sportscasters now want to be the stars, you know? 
[00:01:30]  Yes.  That's what it's all about.  We get it.  He could go all...  I understand the way, shithead.  We could go all...  Could he?  Could he?  He has a 20-yard lead on the guy chasing him.  Exactly.  I think he's going to make it.  He's got Christopher E. blown into a straw behind him.  Right, trying to move his wheelchair to catch him.  I think he's going to score.  That's so good.  Hey, could!  He sort of takes away from those special moments.  And it's like, you know, I've just seen the tape. 
[00:02:00]  He goes all the...  Fucko.  Who made the fucko list of Chris Berman?  That is hard!  That is far!  So we got John Sterling audio from him calling Yankee games, right?  And the names, by the way, that he assigns these players.  Because the best phrase, the douche chill I get in the car, I can't even listen to him anymore.  Yeah?  I cannot listen.  That bad.  Dude, they're terrible names! 
[00:02:30]  Like what?  I don't know what...  Well, we got some examples.  Yeah, I think we're going to start here.  Letters high!  Letters high!  Letters high!  All right, here we go.  Now the 1-1.  Swung on the air, goes to right!  It is high!  It is far!  It is gone!  Oh, he's done it again!  Jason Giambi!  And boy, did he hit a shot! 
[00:03:00]  Oh, way out in right field!  He timed a fastball and drilled it out!  It is a three-run homer for Jason Giambi!  The Giambino!  And the Yankees take out 5-4 leagues!  Is it true that was during batting practice?  Yeah, probably.  The Giambino?  Giambino!  See, that was actually a great call until he said that.  Yeah, the Giambino.  That was a great call.  It is high.  It was quick.  It wasn't dragged out and annoying. 
[00:03:30]  The Giambino.  Yeah.  All right, let's listen to the next one.  2-1 Seattle in the 7th.  And the right-handed Eels swung on it.  Into the air.  The deep right center.  It is high.  It is far.  It is gone!  It's a grand slam!  Bernie goes boom!  He drills a grand slam into the bleachers in deep right center.  Burn!  Baby, burn!  And the Yankees have taken a 5-2 lead. 
[00:04:00]  I would rather have Bernie strike out than have to listen to that.  Listen to that drivel.  Bernie goes boom.  Burn, baby, burn.  Burn, baby, burn.  But probably spelled B-E-R-N.  Of course.  Because his name is Bernie.  And when guys hit home runs, oh, this is the worst.  Like, if you guys were both up and you hit home runs, which you do in my eyes every day.  Of course.  Thanks, Jimmy.  He would say, he would say, the hit home runs, a back-to-back and a belly-to-belly. 
[00:04:30]  Dude.  Dude.  Back-to-back and a belly-to-belly.  He goes, and duh.  And a belly-to-belly.  All right, here we go.  That is awful.  It's horrendous.  Here's another call. 
[00:05:00]  And here's a 2-1.  Swung on.  Hit in the air to deep right center.  Logan is after it.  A way back in right center.  That ball is gone.  Oh, it carried into the right center field bleachers.  And A-bomb from A-Rod.  Alex Rodriguez adds to his major league leading total.  His 15th stinger.  And the Yankees take a 1-0 lead.  Here's the 0-1.  Swung on.  Hits in the same area to deep right center.  That ball is high.  It is far.  And it's gone. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, it's he hot.  Another A-bomb from A-Rod.  He hit a two-run blast over the 385-foot side.  And the Yankees take a 3-0 lead.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  How fucking awful is an A-bomb from A-Rod?  He's got it, like, really over.  You know who caught an A-bomb from A-Rod?  The last guy that was banged by Robert Reed. 
[00:06:00]  He dropped a doozy right to his colon.  Right out of the hole of the Enola faggot. 
[00:06:30]  Here's the next call.  Here's Posada.  He has won a deep left.  That ball is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  Georgie shoots one.  He drilled the ball ten rows back in the lower seat and left.  A Posada home run.  And the Yankees take a 4-0 lead.  Be a 1-0.  Swung on.  And there goes the deep right.  It is high.  It is far.  It is gone. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, another Yankee home run.  Georgie juiced one again.  He had a line drive toward the old Yankees bullpen in right.  A three-run post on a blast.  And the Yankees now take a 10-0 lead.  Ah, the good old days.  Georgie juiced one.  Georgie.  It's fucking on.  I can't listen to Yankee anymore.  That is really bad. 
[00:07:30]  Do you understand?  Are you 18-0 Martinez ones in here?  Ah, I'm looking.  We got the Alexander the Great.  I don't know.  The pitch is swung on.  Hit in the air to deep center.  That ball is high.  It is far.  There it is.  Gone.  In the black.  Oh, another bomb from A-Rod.  Alexander the Great hunkers again.  A home run in the black in dead center.  To break the scoreless high.  Do you know my head is tingling right now? 
[00:08:00]  Yuck.  That's so awful.  Yeah.  My head is itching.  Isn't that just the worst?  It's the same feeling I got when I was 16.  And I was jerking off reading a foreign magazine.  And my mother walked into my bedroom.  Embarrassment.  Sheer embarrassment.  No, no, no.  The desire to grab someone's head and force it on my cock.  Don't misquote me.  An A-Bomb from A-A-Rod.  Let's say hi to Mark in Connecticut.  Mark.  Dad liked what?  Yeah.  When a Sterling call from a couple years ago or a year or something ago, Yankees lost 
[00:08:30]  something like 25 to nothing.  At the end of the game, Sterling was all in tears.  He was like, you know, the best thing about baseball is that the sun will come up tomorrow.  That was, like, the call.  Really?  Is there any Tino Martinez ones here?  I don't think so.  Oh, no.  Back to back.  Oh, no.  We got some Tino coming up.  Good, good, good.  But first, we got the Yankees win call.  Again, if it's done right, I like it.  There's a way to do it where it's genuine and a way where it's not. 
[00:09:00]  But every game he ends with this.  Yes.  That the Yankees win.  Rivera at the belt and the 0-2.  Check it out swinging.  Ball game over.  Yankees win.  The Yankees win.  Do they?  They're trying to be the stars.  It's not about the players anymore.  I like the guy.  I know this is a local reference.  A guy named Charlie Steiner was doing the game. 
[00:09:30]  And I like Susan Waldman.  And she's a big fan, obviously, as well as being an announcer.  But, God damn it, John.  Just stop.  Do the calls.  Good.  You know, he's got a great voice.  He knows how to do a call.  So just do it.  Yeah.  An A-bomb from A-Rod?  Who looks at that and goes, that was fucking great?  When you went...  He's brilliant.  When you went, it is high, it is far.  I think, for now on, when one of us has a killer line in the show, someone has to call 
[00:10:00]  it.  Burn!  I'll be burned!  Or if you guys have good lines, I'll go, a back-to-back and a belly-to-belly.  Hey, Prozac.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, Prozac.  Hey, this John Sterling is such an arrogant prick.  He won't come on the air when the game starts until Susan Waldman says, and now the voice  of the New York Yankees, John Sterling.  Well, it's called an introduction, sir.  Yeah, the nerve of him. 
[00:10:30]  Can't fault him for that.  He won't come on until the power's up.  Jesus.  I don't know if it's a nitpick, sir.  The man's a bull, but...  Nate, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  Morning, Juicy Nipples.  Thank you.  You guys are missing the most annoying thing about Sterling.  The fact that he will not even call the game.  The game is secondary compared to his own inane babble.  I once heard him talking about the tires on his car.  He was going, but you know, Susan, I've got these all-season rate of the pitcher strike,  and, you know, I keep them on my car all year long.  I got it, in a way, to defend Sterling on that one. 
[00:11:00]  All announcers do that a little bit.  You know who was great at that?  Phil Rizzuto.  Rizzuto was awful.  He was great about talking about everything but the game, is what I'm saying.  Right.  No, no, dude, I know what you're saying, but I actually like the way Sterling calls, you  know, the pitch.  It's like the game is completely secondary.  Whatever he happens to be talking about at the time, he won't even tell you what pitch  was thrown if he's in the middle of something else.  I don't know.  I haven't noticed that.  Maybe you're right, but I like the way he actually does a regular call.  I actually like a regular call.  All right. 
[00:11:30]  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Rugburn from Black Bag.  Rugburn.  You guys need to get Big A to do the Yankee calls.  Oh, Jesus.  The Yankees win.  The Yankees win.  Punch it out, boy.  It is high.  All right.  Here's another call.  The pitch is swung on, and there it goes to deep right.  It is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  He's done it again.  He's done it again.  The Bantino.  Oh, not the Bantino. 
[00:12:00]  I don't believe it, and I'm seeing it.  I haven't missed a game with the Yanks in 17 years.  I haven't seen anything like this.  Constantino Martinez of Tampa, Florida, has hit his second home run of the game.  A two-run home run.  Ties the game at three.  Unbelievable.  In all those years of broadcasting, he hasn't seen a player hit two homers in one game?  No.  It really was.  It was a life-changing experience.  Jesus.  The Bantino. 
[00:12:30]  That's the one.  That actually makes my asshole go in farther.  A pucker.  Yeah.  It's a real, like, you can hear my asshole go, oh.  That's so gross.  Now the payoff.  Swung on, drilled a deep right field.  Back goes Burns.  It is gone.  It's off the back wall.  I think it's gone.  It is gone.  Another Tino home run.  Is that amazing?  Is that absolutely amazing? 
[00:13:00]  He is at seven homers in the last eight games.  The Bantino.  He drills a home run in the Yankees' trail 3-1.  Brr.  To the Bantino.  Who's in the car going, come on, say Bantino.  Say it.  You know you want to.  Brian, Tennessee.  Hey, guys.  Morning.  Morning.  Hey.  Hey, it could be worse.  I don't know the guy's name, but you could have the announcement for the Atlanta Braves. 
[00:13:30]  A little drudge.  A little slow talking.  Took you to sleep.  No, and I like that.  There's a lot I like about Sterling.  I'm not saying he sucks that they should fire him.  But those specific things that he's obsessed with.  It's like an OCD thing with him.  He's turning the doorknob three times every time Tino hits a home run.  He's got to say that.  It just becomes irritating.  Because I do think he does a good game.  That's what bugs me.  I like his calls.  Do you think maybe he's trying to be like an ESPN reporter?  Yeah.  Hey, Mike. 
[00:14:00]  Go.  Oh, oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I got to check on this one, James.  This one's out of here.  It's just terrible.  And I'm also sick.  Who is it?  Coleman that does the Met games is very overrated.  Yeah.  You know.  Looking up.  It's out of here.  Is it?  Shithead.  It's out of here.  He's a fucking cornball, too.  Now the right-hander is set to be a 2-2 to Giambi.  And the pitch is swung on and hit in the air to deep right. 
[00:14:30]  It is hard.  Yes.  It is far.  It is gone.  A walk-off, two-run, bottom-of-the-tenth home run by Jason Giambi.  The Giambino.  Ball game over.  Yankees win.  The Yankees win.  The Giambino.  No, no.  That would be stupid.  It's the Giambino. 
[00:15:00]  Ah.  The Giambino.  Does he know that he sounds like a real douchebag when he says that?  The Giambino.  The Bam Tino.  Two to go.  Penniman is set.  And he deals.  Swung on in line to left center field.  It is a base hit.  Rounding third is Reigns.  He'll score.  Tino goes to third.  It's a two-out.  Base hit to left center by Mariano Duncan.  And the Yankees have taken a 3-2 lead. 
[00:15:30]  The goody-gritty Yanks have struck again.  Yeah, I never liked it.  But I actually liked that call up until, wow, Mariano Duncan.  Jesus, that's got to be fucking eight years ago.  The Dunkino.  Right?  Mariano Duncan dunks one into center field.  But no, I liked that call except the gutty-gritty Yanks.  Yeah, he used to always say that.  But that didn't bother me as much.  Yeah.  But I know when he was saying, hey, Mike, go home.  One more.  The 2-1.  Swung on and hit high in the air. 
[00:16:00]  The Zeke left center.  That ball is going to be high.  It's going to be far.  Gone.  Derek Jeter.  It's his first grand slam.  The first grand slam of Jeter's career.  A wallop over the left center field wall.  A grand slam.  And the Yankees now have a 7-1 lead.  What was wrong with that call?  Nothing wrong with that clip.  We can't end with that. 
[00:16:30]  That's fine.  That was a good call.  And radio, you've got to end with a good one.  You've got to end with a high note.  I mean, I don't want to take it on Kansas, but.  Of course.  Here's what was that call.  Oops, right?  All right.  We'll try to end with this one.  Bill Risley warms in the bullpen.  Mattingly swings in.  He has a drive to deep right center.  It is high.  It is far.  It is down.  Back to back.  Minabilly to belly.  And Mattingly homers in a right center-bale area.  And the Yankees take up 3-2 lead. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, wow.  Has he been doing that since 94?  That long.  That long.  Mattingly call.  Wow.  Wow.  Back to back.  And Andy Hawkins has been knocked out of the game.  Holy shit.  And a belly to belly.  Too bad Ben didn't hit a home run.  A scalp to scalp.  And a hog to hog. 
[00:17:30]  Lou Gehrig hits one.  Oh, shaky running around the bases.  It is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  Ramon.  Ramon.  Bring Bam Tino a home run.  And a hit.  It is high.  It is far.  It is gone. 
[00:18:00]  Back to back.  And fixed belly to belly.  And stapled belly to belly.  Yes, they call me the Bear Beano.  And Carly, she hits another Bear Bones home run.  It is the worst of the O.P. and Anthony show.  Did I just fart?  Uh, Jackie, New Jersey, what's up? 
[00:18:30]  Hello, boys.  Hi.  Opie, did you see the Good Times Marathon on TV Land this weekend?  Did they really have a Good Times Marathon?  I spent my weekend watching the Good Times Marathon.  Opie, 48 hours of it, 96 episodes, about 500 exclamations of James!  James!  It was so...  I hadn't watched Good Times an entire episode in a long, long time.  This was a marathon.  So, I watched quite a few episodes in a row. 
[00:19:00]  That show was awful.  Just horrible.  There was nothing funny about it.  Until you watch about five or six episodes, then it starts becoming funny because it's so bad.  The catchphrases, just the storylines, they were all...  I can't even not say it.  Niggers.  It was... 
[00:19:30]  Let me say...  Jimmy...  What the hell's wrong with you?  It was...  And this is why John Amos left the goddamn show.  Because it was just this stereotypical, awful portrayal of a black family.  Horrid.  Not funny at all.  And just storylines about, you know, a wino that they bring into the house, and drugs, and JJ's always stealing stuff. 
[00:20:00]  This is all the stuff I forgot.  This is all the stuff I forgot.  They had a...  Remember Walona, the neighbor that lived next door?  She had a husband named Ray, who left her, of course, and comes back a few years later and tries to get back with her and says that he's changed.  Well, he's got to come in and wait for Walona to get back, because the horror is she's out with the rest of the Evans family.  And what's her name there?  The daughter?  What the hell was her name?  Thelma?  Thelma.  She's at home doing her homework. 
[00:20:30]  Ray comes in.  What happens?  Ray just pretty much attacks her as she's doing her homework.  She's trying to do her work, and he's like, hey, how you doing?  Gets right up behind her.  Come on, baby!  In his pimp attire.  He's just like a pimp.  John Amos left the show.  He left the show after two seasons.  Only two seasons?  Only two seasons.  He left the goddamn show because of this bad, black stereotypes that were being portrayed on this show. 
[00:21:00]  Just horrible.  And nothing funny.  At all.  The lines were so bad and so predictable.  Cornball.  I liked John Amos, though.  He's my favorite part of the show.  John Amos.  Yeah, there was some scenes where he was funny, how he'd get pissed off at J.J.  But it just became a big catchphrase.  Like, back then with TV, that was the point where it started.  You needed the happy days catchphrase. 
[00:21:30]  You needed the standout person that would come on and you'd hear the whoo from the audience.  And then they got, like, every episode turned into a special episode.  And this didn't take long in that show.  After a year, they weren't handling comedy anymore.  They were trying to cover the issues that were being presented to the black families of the time.  And it was just done in a horrible, awful, stereotypical way.  Really bad.  I think all shows need that guy that just walks on and gets the applause and does a few lines.  Oh, like perhaps a neighbor that drops in? 
[00:22:00]  Maybe.  Maybe a friend.  Yeah, we have David Duke checking in.  David, what's up?  Hey, good morning, boys.  Morning.  Just wanted to remind Anthony that our next meeting is tonight and that he should bring  plenty of rope for the after-meeting activity.  Oh, Jesus.  Why?  White people can't use the word.  Take care, boys.  That was the...  If there was any time a white person should use a word, it was when I just used it.  So shut up.  I can think of 655 more appropriate occasions.  But that's just off the top of my head. 
[00:22:30]  Because it was.  That's what they were acting like on the show.  And it was really the first show that presented a black family as the lead characters in this  show.  It wasn't like All in the Family with the Jeffersons living next door.  And that was later on anyway.  This was a show based on that.  And what they portrayed was this bad, stereotypical black family.  They lived in the ghetto.  And then I'm like, they had this one episode where this building committee was checking all 
[00:23:00]  their apartments and they were going to give a prize for the best apartment, the way it's  decorated and stuff.  And Florida was putting new slipcovers on the couch and everything.  Yet the refrigerator was still filthy.  Like they had around every painting that was on the wall was like the dirt spots.  Like they painted the set like that, obviously, to make it look like the walls.  The front door around the doorknob was just filthy.  If they were going to clean up the place so that a committee could come in and judge how 
[00:23:30]  well you're taking care of it, wouldn't you take a little formula 405 to it or something?  Maybe just clean it up a bit.  All these slipcovers.  Just the slipcovers on there.  Another one.  This episode killed me.  And now I'm laughing hysterically at the show.  Not with the show.  At the show.  So, James, James, he got a letter that said he was up for this union job that was going  to pay $4.50 an hour. 
[00:24:00]  And they are talking like they're going to move.  They're going to move to a mansion.  This is great.  They're going to get a maid for James making $4.50 an hour.  I understand the show.  Oh, it's Formula 409?  Thank you, Derek.  I made that mistake some other time and someone pointed that out.  You want to wash out stains with a freeway in Los Angeles?  Give me the 10.  I spilled something.  I understood what he was saying.  That's very funny.  Very good.  So, James is up for the union job. 
[00:24:30]  Going to make $4.10 an hour or $4.50 an hour.  They're going to move on up.  And he goes, well, Florida, I'm going for the interview tomorrow.  Let's have us a party.  And Florida goes, well, James, where do we get the money?  And he goes, just use the rent money.  We'll have plenty after I get this job.  And I just sat there and I went, oh, no.  I said it.  I said, that's called nigger rich.  That's called.  I remember my mother or uncle or something. 
[00:25:00]  If you get like $10 in your pocket and run out and spend it, that's what they called it.  Being nigger rich.  That was the word for it.  Welcome to the Opie and Fat Nick Show.  No shit, man.  No, these are, look, if anyone's offended by this, turn the fucking station.  This is just the way people talked, especially back then.  And it's the way I'm describing the situation.  This was language that was used.  And, excuse me, sorry, it's still being used. 
[00:25:30]  There are white people.  I hang around people that use it all the time.  That was a term that meant you were spending your money instead of saving it.  And the way it was portrayed on good times, that's what they were doing.  You ever pass a joint around to your friends and it comes back to you and it's all wet?  What is that called?  You lipped it.  Yeah.  You know what else they call it when you spend all your money and don't pay the rent?  Irresponsible.  Right. 
[00:26:00]  Don't hang me out to dry here, kids.  No, absolutely.  Speaking of hanging, no.  I am totally being honest with the language.  This is terminology like no one's ever heard this before.  Has anyone ever heard this before?  You ever heard that term?  No, absolutely.  Of course you have.  I have never.  You ever scream it out a window?  No, but I've thought it a couple times.  Damn fumble.  That was never said in my liberal household.  That was, my mother would throw that term around like it was, like it was, was. 
[00:26:30]  And, yeah, but that was, and of course now James goes for the job interview.  There was some kind of computer glitch and James is supposed to be 41, I guess, in the  show at the time.  The age cutoff was 35 for this union job.  And because of a computer glitch, it had him, his age being at 35, and he couldn't get the  job.  So he's sitting there and gets all pissed off at the white guy behind the desk, goes back 
[00:27:00]  home.  They're throwing a big party for him with the rent money.  And he's got to tell everyone he doesn't have the job.  That is what the show is about.  Every episode, there was just this stereotype going on.  A far cry from the Cosby show.  Do we have to play this?  Where that awful word would never come up if you're talking about the Cosby show. 
[00:27:30]  Except maybe sexual harassment.  That awful word.  What is that?  A lot of people requesting a very, very famous Opie and Anthony bit.  I remember that one.  I haven't heard this in years.  I made a little slip up on the show about good times.  You certainly did.  Want to play this thing?  Yeah.  All right, let's go to the tape.  You know, I stole the Playboy with Florida in it.  No, wait.  Florida?  Oh, Thelma, Thelma, Thelma.  James! 
[00:28:00]  James!  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  James, Opie's looking at me, James.  Look, I got that big pack of hot dogs stable to the back of my neck.  James!  Where's J.J.?  Thelma.  Thelma was just...  You said Florida.  Everyone heard it.  Opie had the hots for Florida when he was a kid.  Come on, everyone heard it.  Opie!  Come here, give me some love. 
[00:28:30]  Little brown sugar, Opie.  James!  That was only until Wheezy came along.  All right, all right.  The beauty that was Wheezy.  All right.  Oh, if only I could be George Jefferson.  I'll move you on up.  Now you've gone too far, man.  You said it, man.  Yeah, how about that Anesta, Opie?  Shut up.  Come here, heathen!  Oh, man.  Well, let's change the subject and talk about Stephen Lynch.  I could never squeeze out syrup out of that Aunt Jemima bottle without thinking, wow, what 
[00:29:00]  a hot babe.  Yeah.  I'd lose my syrup.  Oh, man.  Well, you heard it here, folks.  Opie, hots for Florida from good times.  Stole the Playboy.  That Playboy I never saw, but I guess it's in Opie's personal collection.  The one with Florida.  James, I'm making him play, boy. 
[00:29:30]  All right.  Son of a...  Look at the picture we got on the wall.  Check this out.  James!  Oh, man.  There she is.  Esther Rowe.  Wow.  She is truly dino-one.  Yeah, look at that.  Yeah.  That's chocolate thunder.  It just sucks when you put your foot in your mouth on this show, you know?  What was Hugh Hefner thinking that month, huh? 
[00:30:00]  I don't know.  He was on the crank.  All right.  It was after the stroke.  Get me, Esther Rowe!  I am trying to change the subject here so much, because this could go on for another three weeks.  James!  Here's the picture of me.  Are you feeling that tingle?  Yeah.  Here it is, Opie. 
[00:30:30]  Time to feel free.  In the time of the month.  Not getting hassled.  Not getting hustled.  Keeping your head up of water.  Opie loves mama.  Dino man!  Good times!  Good times!  Easy credit rip-off.  Good times!  Sticking in and surviving.  Hanging in and jawing!  Good times! 
[00:31:00]  Hey, we're lucky we got him.  Good times!  Yeah!  Opie's got good times in his pants.  Woo!  James!  Now, J.J., I have company this evening.  Opie's coming over.  After James got killed, remember that?  Yeah.  She would have liked a guy like you.  Shut up.  You'd have fit good in the projects.  You'd have to suffer the scrutiny of Michael, the younger brother. 
[00:31:30]  Yes!  Yes!  Remember how angry he was.  I don't think Opie would have cut the mustard.  Michael!  His hair and everything.  Mama!  Why are you dating that white boy?  He's very nice.  Now, come on.  Let mama go out with Opie.  James!  Mama, he's the devil. 
[00:32:00]  Well, he sure is the devil in bed.  Wait till I tell Walona what he did to me.  Ha ha ha!  Oh, of course he can't stack up the James, Larry Counts.  Ha ha ha!  You know, this picking on someone is not that fun ever.  Ha ha ha!  I always thought it was fun to pick on people.  Oh, it's a blast.  Come on this side.  Ha ha ha!  All right. 
[00:32:30]  Hey, this is Tom Morello from Audioslave.  And this is Brad Wilk.  Timmy C.  Chris Cornell here.  You are listening to the worst of opium and...  It's the worst.  Timmy, you really need to drink more.  And you'll be an Anthony.  Speaking of cabbies, you've got to tell the cabbie story.  I mean, we're going to be all over the ball field today, but...  Actually, Anthony made this point a while ago.  I mean, in this city, if you're lucky enough, quote, to have a white cabbie,  nine out of ten times, he's crazy. 
[00:33:00]  They're insane.  They're, like, really crazy people.  They're, I don't know, they seem like homeless people that happen to get a hack license.  They just have, like...  They're all crazy in that way where you could see them sleeping on the street.  But they're white.  They're not Middle Eastern.  They're not wearing a turban.  But you get in the cab and go, wow, it's a white guy.  And you expect maybe, you know, the old style.  Like an episode of Taxi.  Maybe.  Maybe Rieger or something. 
[00:33:30]  But you don't get that.  But you get certifiably insane people.  I, I, um...  Oh, hi, how are you?  This is the new intern.  Ah!  Can I have a coffee just for just a little bit of milk from the machine here?  Thanks a lot.  Very good.  New intern.  I'll turn to the young gentleman.  So I get in my cab.  I leave.  I say goodbye to all the people that work in the building that love me.  Yeah.  And I get into a cab.  I have my headphones on.  I want to listen to something.  And I just...  It's a white guy wearing a hat. 
[00:34:00]  And I just see the movement of his fat head.  And I'm like, oh, he's talking.  What?  And you got your ear fogged in.  I got my ear plugged in.  I'm looking for Sabbath, actually.  I'm looking for Sabbath.  Of course you are.  One of your little hole in the sky in the wind.  So I take it out.  I'm like, oh, I'm sorry, sorry.  I didn't hear you.  I had my thing in, which is a hint for shut your fat face.  Right.  Stupid.  And he's like, bet you never saw a well-dressed-up cabbie before.  Which is correct.  Um, I just want to get to where I'm going in silence. 
[00:34:30]  So I'm like, no, no, I think it's good.  Dressing up.  And I put it back in.  And I look up again.  And I just see his fat mouth continuing to...  It's like, you know, when someone's talking, if you're looking at them from the back right view,  you'll just see the subtle movements of their head.  And you're praying they have Parkinson's, but you know they don't.  They're talking.  So I take it out again.  I'm like, sorry, I didn't hear you.  He's like, well, you know, after 9-11, I traded in my black car.  I guess he was a livery driver.  For a yellow one.  So I realize he's wearing a chauffeur's uniform. 
[00:35:00]  He's driving a yellow cab.  In a chauffeur uniform.  And he looked exactly like the doorman from the Jeffersons.  That's who he looked like.  It was stupid.  And I'm driving me down Broadway.  And he goes, yeah, I even got a red, white, and blue tie to commemorate the victims.  He holds up his red, white, and blue tie so I can see it in the back.  And he starts talking about how he's the positive cab driver.  And he goes, whenever you have negativity, use me like a computer chip.  Just double-click on my icon mentally and think of the positivity. 
[00:35:30]  Let me take away your negativity.  And all I'm thinking of is what it would be like to strangle him like they did Johnny Ola.  His fucking fat neck with some piano wire or something.  Just to shut him up.  And as I'm getting out, his awful tip-begging diatribe.  That's what it is.  Of course it is.  And I get out, and he hands me a thank you card.  A card?  It's in an envelope.  I was praying to be white powder in it so I could just fucking eat it and get this over with. 
[00:36:00]  And I really, I know he doesn't have XM.  I tried to get him to do a phone-in because he's such an ass.  Yeah, of course he is.  But wherever he is, I hope he has hit a pole.  Does he have a pile of these on his seat?  I'm sure he does because I just want to thank you for being a, do you really, insincere, fatso?  Why do you have these typed out?  You don't know anything about me.  How do you know what our experience is going to be like together?  Thank you.  Yeah, and this is what it says.  I thought it was like a generic Hallmark card or whatever.  But I look and I realize this man has typed all this in. 
[00:36:30]  Are you surprised to see a dressed-up taxi driver?  That's good.  He puts his opening line in the card.  Fucking, he's like a hack in every way.  A hack and a hack.  Hack, hack.  The taxi commission is looking for me and I'm dodging him.  Shithead.  I used to be a limo driver before 9-11 and instead of a slash between 9-11, he has a question mark  because apparently fucking Tom the Doorman doesn't proofread before he hands that shit out. 
[00:37:00]  Ah, gotcha.  I traded my black car in for a yellow car.  And this is what he told me.  He hit the shift key, did he?  I have not read this card yet.  I honestly, I have not.  So this, if it's redundant, it's because he just repeats what's on his fucking card.  Before 9-11 in February of 2001, the bubble burst on the dot-coms.  Then millions of people were laid off all over the world.  Then all the businesses cut their expenses accounts to zero.  A ripple effect happened and all businesses that supported other businesses then laid them  off and some went bust.  I hope this guy is dead. 
[00:37:30]  Right.  Then when the World Trade Center got hit.  Period.  Alan Greenspan with cranky ass.  This is, no, no, this is the sentence.  This is the sentence.  It goes, went bust, period.  Then when the World Trade Center got hit.  Period.  Shouldn't that be a comma?  Look, you fucking fatso in a chauffeur outfit.  How about that?  Okay, so that's the whole sentence.  That's the whole sentence.  Then when the World Trade Center got hit.  Yes.  No, that's the end of the thought.  Shithead. 
[00:38:00]  Uh, and then the next sentence.  It just put icing on the cake.  Oh, I hate him.  It just put icing on the cake.  And he capitalizes icing and cake.  Well, wouldn't you?  Of course I would.  They're both proper names.  Mr. Icing Cake.  That's right.  Mr. Icing and Mrs. Cake would like to say,  Duh, you fat pig.  It just put the icing on the cake, comma.  And it blow everything out of the ballpark for everybody.  Yes, it does blow everything out of the ballpark.  What?  Wow.  So I'm still chauffeuring people around. 
[00:38:30]  Why shouldn't I dress appropriately, positively, and professionally?  No question mark, of course.  You might as well put that instead of a slash in between 9 and 11.  You fucking blubber.  That's where you're supposed to use that question.  Of course.  And he capitalizes and darkens appropriately, positively, and professionally.  And the next sentence, because I want you to leave my car more positive than you came in and have a more positive day, said Robert Reed.  And then in parentheses. 
[00:39:00]  I'm positive you're an ass.  He really is.  I want you to leave my car more positive than you came in and have a more positive day.  And then in parentheses.  Weekend, comma, flight, comma, stay in New York, comma, et cetera.  Oh, like if you're here for the weekend, like he's giving different reasons you might have been in his car.  Been in his car.  It's the weekend, you have a flight to catch.  Right.  He's just trying to be pertinent and relevant.  Anytime you have any negativity, capitalized and darkened, picture me as a computer icon in your mind. 
[00:39:30]  This fucking asshole is just putting a thank you card in what he babbled about the whole time.  What he babbled during the ride.  As the only taxi driver wearing a chauffeur uniform and an American flag tie in parentheses since 9-11.  What?  What'd you wear before that?  A red one with a white circle in the middle of it?  You fucking Jap lover?  And listen to classical music.  Everything is positive and relaxing.  Yeah.  I wonder if he gives himself these affirmations in the mirror. 
[00:40:00]  I am not a fat pig in a yellow cab.  I make people happy.  You make no one happy.  You know how people are happy?  Thank God I'm not that horse's ass.  All right.  Everything is positive ever since 9-11.  And listen to classical music.  Everything is positive and relaxing.  So anytime you have any negativity, you pull up my icon and double click it and let my positivity flow out.  So to rid of the negativity out, so to get rid of the negativity getting in, use me as a catalyst to get started. 
[00:40:30]  Wow.  I wish he was here.  You know what I'd like to do to this guy?  I'd like to remove his chauffeur cap and hold his cheeks and sink my teeth into his forehead.  I wouldn't even utter a word.  I would just bite his forehead and smell his sweaty hairline.  You know how annoying this just sounds?  Dude.  And you had to live this?  I had to sit in it.  You just wanted to get a fucking ride to work.  White cab drivers.  That's less than five minutes from here. 
[00:41:00]  They all want to talk.  I wanted a hole in the sky and I got this.  Everybody needs help?  Question mark.  That's...  Everybody needs help!  All right.  Now he's an 80-year-old Jew.  Everybody needs help?  So I planted a seed of positivity in your subconscious mind.  Yes, you already did.  And it's festering, sir, into a tree wishing I could hang you from it.  That's who your seed is blossoming into. 
[00:41:30]  Poison ivy.  I'd rather wipe my ass with poison ivy that you planted than listen to this dreck.  He picked the wrong person to plant a positive seed.  Wow.  That's right.  You watch how positive Jim is from this point on.  I hope someone plants some seeds of positivity all over your back, motherfucker.  So anytime you need me, I will be there.  And I wish I could...  I have to post this.  T-H-E-I-R.  T-H-E-I-R.  Yeah. 
[00:42:00]  There.  Right.  As in...  Like, I will be their reason...  Right.  ...for hating their day.  There.  So anytime you need me, I will be there to help you and support you.  Just think of me.  Of course.  And, uh...  It's almost done.  Let me thank you for being a valued client, exclamation point.  A what? 
[00:42:30]  A valued client, exclamation point.  Client.  Yeah.  I'm a client.  I have so appreciated serving you.  I look forward to many years of giving you the highest standard of excellence in service.  His name is Paul something something.  You're a positive taxi driver.  And he wouldn't even...  I wanted him to call on this radio show.  Yeah.  Because the man is a boob.  He is a complete horse's ass.  I'm like, would you call on to a radio show?  He's like, nah, I don't have time.  Time?  Yeah, I can see you're obviously a real busy man about town. 
[00:43:00]  With your red, white, and blue tie.  He's got to, uh, get back to his printer.  I just want you people to know that if they ever find a fat man hanging by the neck from a red, white, and blue tie with a chauffeur cap by his, like, turnip root dangling feet,  I want you to know, there's one comedian yelling, yippee-eye-hey, Mr. Falcon.  Let me see the, uh...  I'm going to put this online so I'll walk his name out.  Please tell me you didn't tip him. 
[00:43:30]  I did.  I gave him a tip.  I had to.  I wanted to see how positive he would have been if you didn't give him a tip.  I wanted him to call in, actually.  I like the graphic.  It's a swan swimming through a little pond with lily pads and flowers.  Which is a positive image.  It's a very positive, very happy image.  How old is this guy about?  I'd say, uh, 55.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He's probably had some tough times.  I'm sure he has.  And decided this was going to be his way of, uh, giving, giving back.  He's probably trying to make up, uh, like, karma-wise. 
[00:44:00]  Like you said, good point about the nom.  He probably feels bad about the, uh, the eight-year-old's hands he chopped off because he thought she was coming for him.  Right.  But he realized she was asking for candy.  He's trying to straighten his karma right out.  Look at all that bold type.  Is that a code?  Meanwhile, there's a fucking 40-year-old kid somewhere that can't wear a wristwatch thanks to old knee-jerk reaction.  Thanks to some fucking, some marine in a fucking chauffeur hat back in 1967 that just lopped her little hands off with a machete. 
[00:44:30]  You know, driving a cab trying to fucking put a smile on everyone's face.  Yeah, I think this guy's going to end up killing somebody.  Oh, yeah.  I would save that.  I would save that.  There's something really awful.  That's going to be worth something on eBay someday.  It's always the way with these guys.  We were driving downtown once and, uh, got a, got in a cab and it was a white guy.  And he had these, uh, pictures that he had printed out of a cab accident that day.  And he's showing me these printouts of this accident.  Look at this.  Pretty bad, huh? 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  And then he's talking about what he did before he drove a cab and they all love to just babble, the white guys.  I have his address and his last name.  He puts it on the card.  What a nut.  Maybe we'll write him a little letter and just see if he'll come on the radio.  We've got to get him on the radio.  Actually, he'd be fun to get, I'll say this in his defense.  He's a sociopath.  Yeah.  But he would be a fine, he did do a fine job of driving.  He obeyed all traffic laws.  Did he?  I will say that.  He was the safest cab ride I've had in a while. 
[00:45:30]  Didn't make you sick?  No.  Jerking around, brake.  I love the brake guy.  The guy that's got to accelerate 60 miles an hour toward a stoplight that's red and then jam on the brakes right when he gets there.  And then it turns green, boom, take off your plastic into the back, jam on the brakes again.  And you just know, you're looking at the lights down Broadway or something.  And the way they're timed, you just know this is going to be your ride the entire way down Broadway.  Anyway, smash your head into the plastic, smash the back of your head into the seat, repeat 100 times. 
[00:46:00]  All right.  Hey, this is Patrice O'Neal.  You are listening to The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  I guess which is their best, really, you know, when you think about it.  The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  I was a little impatient this morning with one of the interns.  Oh, yeah, let's get into that.  My God.  I'm sitting on the couch.  We're all just in a really good mood because we've got these news teasers that made us laugh really hard.  And we've got a huge story we're going to get into in a few minutes here that's going to get people thinking and talking today. 
[00:46:30]  And Anthony got his breakfast order.  We have a new crop of interns.  They're great, by the way.  Some of us scare the shit out of them, which is unfortunate.  They're all jumpy.  They're all like little chihuahuas that wet the rug whenever their owner comes in.  They just freak out.  And early on, when we first started the show, we got a crop of interns that turned out to just be gold.  I hate kissing their ass and stuff, but they really did.  They turned out to be very good. 
[00:47:00]  And it really raised the bar for anybody that's going to be coming into this place.  And since then, we've had some lemons.  And now we have a new crop that is proving themselves to be worthy.  Very good.  And they're so attentive in the morning with getting this food and beverage for everybody.  So, this morning, I got my bagel, toasted bagel, with some cream cheese on the side because I like dolloping it on myself. 
[00:47:30]  And I get it.  You don't like dolloping it on yourself.  You just don't want anyone else to touch anything.  Well, that's true, too.  And they always decide to put, like, a brick of cream cheese on your bagel.  What the hell is that about?  I just want a little, as the Jewish people say, a little schmear on the bagel.  Well, that's all.  So, I need a plastic knife.  And what the hell is his goddamn name?  Mike.  Mike.  Mike.  Mike, the young go-getter.  It's Mike. 
[00:48:00]  Mike, the intern.  He comes in, gives me the bagel, and then gives me one of the plastic knives.  And how does he hand me the plastic knife?  Ugh.  I see him walking in with the knife, and he's holding it by the blade of the plastic knife.  The side that I'm going to put in the cream cheese and put on the bagel.  But why is that a problem, really?  Because it's somebody's hand.  But I would just take my shirt or whatever and just wipe it fast, and boom, things are gone.  Look at all of us throughout the day. 
[00:48:30]  Look at our hands, and look what they do on a daily basis.  They're pawing through newspapers that some savage is putting on his newspaper stand.  And they're, you know, up nostrils.  They're picking ears.  You're coughing into them.  I don't know what people are doing.  So then he holds the knife by the blade.  He comes over, and I just instantly, what popped out of my mouth, I couldn't even hold it back.  It was really funny.  It popped out of me before I even knew what I was doing. 
[00:49:00]  Let me tell everyone what Howard Hughes said to the intern.  Tell me what you did.  He comes over, he hands it to me.  This is an exact quote.  I had to write it down.  Tell me what you did.  He hands it to me, and I go, tell me what you did.  Tell me what you did.  And he jumped.  He went, oh, I'll get another.  And, like, freaked out, ran, got another knife.  These guys are all frazzled.  They're so frazzled.  But I didn't even go, like, excuse me, the knife.  I just looked right at him and went, tell me what you did.  That's how you should handle that.  It jumped out of me so fast that I started laughing at myself that that even came out of me. 
[00:49:30]  It was funny.  Tell me what you did.  These guys are working for free.  Then I rolled up the Daily News and smacked him on the nose.  I shoved his face on the knife on the floor and went, no, what did you do?  Bad intern.  Then he knew, and he ran and got you another knife.  Yeah, he'll never hand it to me blade first.  You germaphobe.  But beforehand, he'll probably stick it up the crack of his ass and then hand it to me.  I've ruined that.  I can't have him get me breakfast anymore because now I'm afraid he's going to spit in it. 
[00:50:00]  Right, you have to bring your own knife now, psychopath.  See, I do.  I'll bring a box of plastic knives and keep them on my desk.  I had no idea you had this in you, this whole germ thing.  It's not really a germ thing.  I don't know, man.  It's not about the germs.  It really isn't.  It's about being disgusted by bodily fluids.  I'm not afraid of the germs that are in snot.  People have this misconception that I'm a germaphobe.  I'm not afraid of germs that are in mucus.  I hate mucus.  I'm not afraid of germs that are on people's hands from earwax. 
[00:50:30]  I just think it's disgusting.  Do you know that Anthony is the only person alive that has never picked his nose?  I don't believe he's never picked his nose.  I've picked.  Are you sure?  I use a tissue on my finger.  Finger.  You never just got in there?  Finger.  You never just got in there and went to town?  No.  There have been times I've had to, but it's definitely not around any other people.  On the job site back in the day when I was working for a living?  That's what I don't understand.  You used to do some crazy things on the job site, and now... 
[00:51:00]  Opie, those things are necessary for your own survival.  Now, a stupid plastic knife with maybe an intern's thumbprint on it drives you nuts.  It's anybody's hand.  You used to shit in the...  Spackle buckets.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The old days.  That's what I did.  And there was no toilet paper around, right?  No, no.  You had to use toilet paper.  Stop.  What would you think I was going to wipe with?  Although, once I think I wiped with an old T-shirt.  Yeah.  Then I put it back on and continued working. 
[00:51:30]  I was walking...  Me and my friend Paul McKay were walking to SEAL comic books years ago, and I had to  take out, like, one of those dumps.  It's almost like if you don't shit now, you're just going to collapse in the street.  Yeah.  Your legs actually give out on you.  We'd walk three miles from home while these comic books...  I had to go into this woods area, and I'm taking a dump, and as I'm shitting, there's  yellow jackets flying in between my legs.  What kind of a caveman dump are you taking?  It was awful.  There was bees flying around.  Oh.  I think I had to use my underwear to wipe my ass and throw it out.  Yeah, it was...  It's the worst of the Opie and N3 show. 
[00:52:00]  All right.  We're setting up the liberators for the girls. 
[00:52:30]  We got Friday in studio, and Mackenzie Mack is coming in in a few minutes.  In the meantime, because they're, like, draping some cloth over the liberators, so the girls  could use lube and stuff.  In the meantime, Anthony, really fast.  This is a quickie, I guess.  Andrea Yates Audio from Conversations with Killers.  I guess it's something they're doing on A&E or something like that?  Nice.  A&E, your murderer network.  Love it. 
[00:53:00]  Watch all those crime shows.  Interviews with the murderers, how they did it.  Cold case files.  Fun shows.  So they're talking to killers, basically.  Yeah.  Now they're interviewing them, and this is the Yates one?  Yeah.  Oh.  It's your words of wisdom from her.  Well, we got the 9-11 audio, first of all.  A little piece of that.

I didn't say a word.  No, I saw you just go, wow.  She's very nice.  I know, but you were looking at a picture on your digital camera.  What happened?  It was a picture of Friday's vag.  There's a whole photo shoot, video shoot going on in the studio while we're talking about  Andrea Yates.  Attempting to do just something a little different before we get back to the girls. 
[00:54:30]  No, I know, but I saw your face and you can't just make believe you didn't make...  Couldn't help it.  You know, Jimmy, we're talking about something a little more sexy than what's going on in  the studio.  Ooh.  Jimmy's getting a peek at the...  Wow.  It's really nice.  You like that one, Jimmy?  Jimmy is inspecting Friday.  Yeah.  Wow, Friday's great.  Wow.  It's good size, nice.  Big?

Look at that.  What is this?  Wow.  Where's your other hand?  What are you doing down there?  I'm holding Liddy, actually.  Yeah, he's got Liddy in his hand.  Liddy, what do you think of that, Vag?  Yeah, you know.  That's really nice. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, yeah, you've got to lube up her...  Oh, boy.  All right, now we've got problems.  Wow.  She is squirting a whole bunch of lube right on target.  Screw Andrea Yates, Anthony.  Yeah, let her have her fun.  Oh, what kind of lube is that?  Well, it...  Oh, yeah, Jimmy?  Jimmy's, uh...  Stays wet longer.  Jimmy's got to use a little, uh...  He's sweating.  No, I'm not.  I just forgot to use the other one today.  I don't smell. 
[00:56:00]  All right, what's going on over there, E-Rock?  Oh, my God.  She's lubing up pretty good.  Hold on.  She's what?  She's lubing up pretty good.  Thank you, E-Lo.  Yeah, we know that.

Let's get Mackenzie.  Stat Mac in here.  Wow.  We have Friday, uh...  Topless and bottomless, and...  She's on the console with, uh...

Wow, that goes up your ass, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, it goes in stages.  Yeah, I see.  It's like a little...  I was just starting a...  I lost my anal virginity, like, last week.  You did?  Oh, congratulations.  Thank you.  Wow.  Very cool.  It's Friday, like...  They gave me this one.  It's a dildo snowman, Anthony.  Grandpa give you money for that one?

Ah, ah, ah.  Ooh.  And then I wait.  You get it up here and then you pull them out.  Hey, Friday, you want to see how many you can take right now?  Okay.  I am not prepared.  You're not prepared.  Oh, you might have a...  Yeah.  So, what?  Who's looking?  What?  What's up?  She needs to put an anal plug inside for a few minutes.  Yeah? 
[00:58:30]  And sit there.  There's one outside.  And let it sit there?  All right.  You might as well bring in a box of toys.  It looks like we're going to use a lot of them.  Mackenzie, why don't you start plugging...  You're plugging away because so far you've been the coolest...  Well, both of you girls have been the coolest girls we've had on the XM show.  Like, these girls know what we're looking for.  Exactly.  There.  Now she's getting under us.  Yeah, that's the Liberator.  I like it.  Yeah, the Liberator rocks.  We love the Liberator.

No, we need a fresh clean cake.  Don't take over the Aussie stuff, stupid.  What the hell is that?  That looks like it would do some major damage.  It's a blackjack.  Keith, what is that?  Keith uses that up in the Bronx. 
[00:59:30]  I'm pretty sure I've hit some people with this.  Like a cattle prod.  What is that?  That's another type of pure power.  That's for hitting the G-spot.  Lex, oh, please.  I think that's for hitting the kidney.  Is that...  Jesus.  I never knew, yeah, the pancreas was a G-spot.  You're rubbing the kidney from the inside.  Oh, need batteries?  All right.  Cyber skin.  There you go.  Help me.  All right, let's see.  Let me try to figure out what's going on here.  Mackenzie Mack from MackenzieMack.com. 
[01:00:00]  I already see a problem.  I already see a problem.  Wait, you have to take the bottoms off.  Mackenzie, you have to take the bottoms off so we can see.  Is putting on the cyber what?  Oh.  The cyber...  Basically the strap-on.  We like total nudity.  Totally nudity.  I've been touched too many times for me to put it on my pussy, sorry.  Oh, she's worried about the thing going against her pussy that's dirty.  Well, because everyone in the room is in touch.  Hygiene first.  Everybody.  Will you still show us when you're done?  When it comes to hardcore porn, hygiene first, always.  That's fair.  Yeah.  Strap-on. 
[01:00:30]  She has to be topless.  Yeah, the shirts.  Well, who's into the scene?  It just always looks ridiculous.  I like it, though.  The big bildo.  Like the big strap-on.  She's in greyhunt.  Oh, my gosh.  You like that ass, Jimmy?  Yeah, the ass is...  She has to show the whole thing after.  Because you're going crazy.  It's so not straight.  It's so not straight.  It's big.  It's great.  It's like she's got mountain climbing gear.  All right, look at that.  She has the strap-on on.  She's twitching it around.  Friday's on the Liberator.  Do we really need the top? 
[01:01:00]  No.  All right, wait.  Do we have the little postcards?  Throw this bra at him.  Yeah, you better just throw that bra at him.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that.  On the console.  She's lovely.  Wow.  Wow.  Friday's...  How are we going to do this the Liberator?  Let's see.  Oh, you'll have fun.  Well, here, we'll explain how you do it.  Yeah, we got all kinds of scenarios.  Hold on, guys.  Do you want to see Rock the Boat?  Cupid's Arrow?  Any...  I think we start with the old fucking...  What is that? 
[01:01:30]  What is that thing?  What is that thing called?  I think that's a kid's toy that's got into the studio somehow.  One of Jimmy's dates.  What is that?  It's dope.  You can use it in the fucking shower.  Wait, we got to get the girl from mysexystore.com.  Is that a glow worm or something?  She's coming in.  She's coming in.  Yeah, on your panties.  What the hell is that?  Oh, she's in the producer's studio.  It's Moby Worm coming to get you.  Moby Worm is in her hand coming to get her. 
[01:02:00]  What is that?  This is a waterproof worm, and you can take it, like, showers, bathtub, whatever.  Really?  Two settings.  It'll sit to your ass.  Yes.  Can you drown five children while you pleasure yourself with that?  Okay, now I get it.  Exactly.  All right, well, we got, we got, wow.  Explain that, Anthony.  It looks like a glow worm toy.  No, I don't care about that.  I mean, explain the, what is going on here with Friday bent completely over the liberator.

It's a worm.  Wait, we want two mics, guys.  We need a mic on the area, and we need a mic on Friday.  That's how we do radio.  Let's, uh, let's go.  Oops.  It's all right.  Thanks.  Oh, look at the big plastic dick is falling over.  Why are we bringing the lighter into this situation? 
[01:03:00]  Oh, it's batteries.  Okay.  Batteries, right.  It looks like a lighter.  Will you hold my worm?  Oh.  Oh, Ben, she wants you to hold her worm.  I don't hold worms.  Hey, Steve, look this way.  Yeah.  Smile.  I think, I think those panties need to, um, come off.  Then I think, uh, yeah, they ought to get, go into town.  Who's the other girl taking pictures of this whole thing?  Who are you?  From Liberator.  Oh.  The girl from the Liberator.  Hey.  Taking pictures to bring back to the office.

Want to move the Liberator over?  How about we do that?  Guys, really fast.  Just move the whole sex scene over.  Close it so no one can see.  That's good.  Well, I'm trying to mic her, though, for the radio.  All right, well, here's Mars.  Yeah, her, yeah.  Huh?  Turn it off?  All right.

We got plugging going on over here.

We can use this in Hollywood.  Let's do it.  You know what?  That's very sexy, very hot, but you're being very chick-like.  You know what you got to do?  Yeah.  You got to stand up, get her on the edge, and just fuck her like you're a guy.  Just.  We were just playing.  Oh, I understand.  All about foreplay.  But, you know, we're about moving along, using the Liberator in different ways.  So now just doggy style it.

You guys want to see the, maybe the toe curler?  Which ones do you want to see here?  I want to see the Bum Bandit first.  Yeah, let's do the Bum Bandit.  This is sex with the homeless guy.  Oh, she's smacking her ass with the, uh, rubber dick.

[01:10:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're really making a short work of these sex toys.  Oh, that's the low setting.  That's what?  That's the low setting.  Oh.  Thank you.  It gets even hotter.  Oh, oh.  Uh-oh.  Almost. 
[01:11:00]  It's funny.  Is that too hot?  Oh, shoot.  It slipped out.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  I thought it was ready to...  What was that yay-to-audio you had?  I did a yay-to-vision.  It really sucks it up.  New position, please.  My goodness.  Don't fall, Luffy.  What are you doing?  What?  I'm going to go this way, and you can sit on it.  I'm like that.  Yeah.  Oh, there you go. 
[01:11:30]  Now, Mackenzie is switching.  She's sitting down.  Oh.  I've been wiping this off.  Yeah.  Do you want to try back that ass up?  We could try that one.  Well, now she's laying down, so you've got to go with something that's similar to that  position.  Oh, I know.  Like surfs up.  Oh, yeah.  Surfs up might work.  Here.  Why don't you give the girls the postcard, see which one they want to try.  Which one you girls want to try?  There's all your choices.  What is it?  Name.  Oh, pictures?  Yeah.  Which one you want to try?  Oh, okay.  Which one looks good?  She can do this one right now. 
[01:12:00]  Which one is it?  Exhibit A?  No, what's it called?  Surf's up.  Surf's up?  Oh, there's names.  Yeah, surf's up.  Surf's up.  Nice.  The guy, played by Mackenzie Mack.  Yeah.  From MackenzieMack.com, lays on her back.  Or we can also do this one.  And Friday kind of goes, just backs her ass up.  And we can also do Ride the Swell.  Ride the Swell you like to?  Uh-huh.  All right.  Okay, I'm just going to hold it up here.  All right, yeah, you hold that up.  Well, you guys tell me, so when you guys get hard, is it like that? 
[01:12:30]  Or is it like that?  Because, yeah, I'm a lesbian porn star, I wouldn't know.  Hello.  Hi.  I'm Mackenzie.  Oh, you don't like guys at all?  Oh, I like guys just fine.  But your thing is to do lesbian porn?  Yeah.  I got you.  I do guys in the bedroom at my house.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  Or someone else's bedroom.  All right, Friday has prepared the area, Anthony.  Yes.  And she's now backing up into this as Mackenzie's on her back. 
[01:13:00]  Wait, what does the picture look like?  What am I doing?  This is just like calling a golf match, Anthony.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  While Mackenzie is laying on the rounded part of the Liberator, arching her back.  There you go.  Puts her in position.  The Liberator, officially our favorite sponsor.  Yeah.  The camera should seriously be over here.  Yeah, what are you doing, Steve?  Yeah, Steve, Jesus.  Stupid Steve.  What the hell was he trying to film?  This is a Danny.  Isn't it feel great?  Yes.  It's soft. 
[01:13:30]  It's not like that hard.  It's called Cyber Skin, supposedly.  All right, why don't we get another toy involved for Friday's pleasure there, too.  This one doesn't look like Friday's too comfortable.  She could have a stimulator, too.  Here, Friday, we'll give you your own toy to do what you please.  Oh, what's that one?  That's so hard to reach places.  It's like on the end of a stick.  Oh, yeah.  Hello.  Please keep going.  I knew exactly where it was.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:14:00]  It's going to be fun for both of us.  Friday's straddling McKenzie.  How cute is this?  This is hot.  The goal is to get an orgasm out of this, ladies, just to let you know.  Looks like Steve and Ben working out their problems.  Let's turn you around.  Turn me around?  Oh, yeah, there you go.  Steve is filming her ear.  Good one, Steve. 
[01:14:30]  What are you doing, fucking David Lynch?  He's filming at my ear.  I don't like this.  Isn't that good?  Oh, my God.  Yeah?  Like that?  Steve's the Pablo Picasso of porn.  Jesus.  Turn me while she's coming.  Anyone could get the pussy.  Jesus.  Sounds like a landscape, right?  Yeah.  Blowing leaves.  Sounds like a Mexican outside your house as you're enjoying the A.C.  She's going to come in soon and ask for iced tea and rob us. 
[01:15:00]  Whoa, hey.  Turn around and ride me, baby.  Oh, okay.  That's relaxing.  Wait, I want to see what my pizza tastes like.  Oh, boy.  Ah, the old strap-on dildo blowjob.  That's nice, though.  Shows technique.  Yeah.  And hers is good.  Where she's holding the dildo slash pinch. 
[01:15:30]  She's, uh, yeah, she's tasting herself.  I don't know.  All I see is the back of a hat.  I can't, uh...  Oh, there we go.  I wonder why Carmine Ragusa was sitting here.  Wow.  She, uh, has a very, uh, very good technique.  She gets deep, too.  I like it.  She's really hot.  She's really good at it.  I'll say.  I would tend to think she's done that a couple of times.  Yeah.  That was deep throat right there. 
[01:16:00]  Mm-hmm.  That was good.  Mm-hmm.  Here we go.  Oh, yeah.  What is that, nine inches?  Wow.  Friday, could you just say,  Do you like this, Daddy?  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Show her up.  Wow.  This is beautiful.  Should we go for the grand finale, or what? 
[01:16:30]  What the hell is that?  We all rip our clothes off.  The old...  I'm ready.  Yeah, I know what to do with, what?  Seven men at one time?  One, two, three, four.  Just teasing, I don't know.  They don't know what to do with that, though.  I say we go for an old orgasm there,  for the listeners all over the country.  All right.  You first.  Give it a try.  Yeah, right?  Whose name would you like me to do?  Start jacking off.  What do you think?  Who wants to have an orgasm live on the radio today?  Mackenzie?  I thought we both were.  Or Friday?  They're working on it. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, I know.  I got the strap-on on as well.  Let me get that one right there.  Is that this part?  Ding, ding, ding.  Ding, ding, ding.  Jackpot.  It's not going to be too hard with this thing.  I don't know what it is,  but can I take it home?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Do you know how hot you are?  Yeah, I'm getting pretty hot right now. 
[01:17:30]  Can I get some applause or some sort of like...  Oh, yeah, you can.  Yes.  Ooh.  I'm trying to go.  I'm trying to go.  The plane's already moved to the side.  Yeah.  All right, why don't you straddle her now?  Yeah, do that move.  Let me see that.  She wanted you to face her.  Yeah, face me.  Yeah.  Face, face me.  And hop aboard.  Climb aboard.  She's not like this.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's going to work good.  Okay.  Ooh.  Still lubed up enough, or you need a little more squirt on there? 
[01:18:00]  We got Friday on top now.  Very nice.  Mackenzie on her back.  They're working it in.  A little jiggle jiggle.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Wait, don't you tell me where the fuck you're at? 
[01:19:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wow. 
[01:19:30]  She just fell right off the liberator.  Just like real life.  Wonderful.  As soon as you're done, off.  Bravo.  Wow.  She definitely enjoyed herself.  The band has been lifted from the Opie and Anthony program.  You want to keep that?  You can keep whatever you want there, Mackenzie.  I broke it.  Oh, no. 
[01:20:00]  It got too wet.  We broke it.  Did we?  You broke that vibrator?  Yeah.  Can you fix it?  I don't know what I did, but that was awesome.  Yeah?  Wow, man.  That is something.  That would work.  Thank you.  Hi.  Good job.  Who's next?  Thank you.  Wow.  I don't even know what to say.  Can you hear Opie?  Now the girls are just kind of tongue-in-each-other. 
[01:20:30]  Very nice.  Kissing.  Yay.  Gentle.  Gentle kissing.  Mackenzie, do you have a video in here or something?  I sure do.  It's right there in my purse.  Yeah, what's your video?  It's from Danny's special Latina version, and I'm on the bonus feature with Alexis Amor.  And it's good old lesbian stuff.  I don't think we're using too much toys, but I think it's really oral.  Yeah?  A lot of licking.  A lot of licking and sucking. 
[01:21:00]  Yes.  A lot of licking and sucking.  Jimmy's taking that.  Or you can go to dhdartdanny.com.  Let's go to David in Ohio.  David.  Yeah, what's going on, boys?  What's up, David?  Hi, little Jimmy.  Hi.  Hey, a couple things.  First of all, little Jimmy should have been thanking one of these naughty little girls at some point.  And the other thing, I'd like to hear Liddy talk dirty to one of them. 
[01:21:30]  I don't think you're going to hear that.  Yeah.  Not Liddy.  Jimmy, you want to spank one of the girls?  I don't know.  She's shy?  I'm really shy.  Oh, please.  All right.  There's no shyness around here.  Are you kidding me?  All right, so we got Mackenzie.  Who wants to get the spanking, Mackenzie or Friday?  Is it going to be hard?  No, if you don't want to.  You don't like a...  Whatever you want.  You have to remove the penis, though.  It's going to be too tempting. 
[01:22:00]  You want to remove it for me?  Yeah.  There's a clasp there.  That camera, I thought it was beginner's luck.  And there's a clasp there.  I know he wants to remove the tick.  And it's just kind of...  Because now she can take the panties off.  Can I hold that?  No, we'll just leave it there in my seat.  Thanks, stand it up.  So I can sit down, quote, unquote.  Yeah, we better take the panties off.  I'll be nice.  Oh, my gosh.  It's good.  Yes, I am.  Oh, totally shaved. 
[01:22:30]  No, I won't.  Yeah, well, I laser it off, actually.  You laser it off.  So I have to let it grow a little bit, and then we'll laser off.  Laser?  Yeah.  Does that hurt?  Hell, yeah.  But no pain, no gain, right?  And then what?  It just doesn't grow back?  Not for two years.  For two years.  Isn't there permanent laser they can do?  Yeah, they can.  But maybe one day I'll want to race things, whatever you call it.  Yeah.  You know, one day a landing strip.  Oh, sure, a little variety.  One day a triangle.  A big M for Mackenzie. 
[01:23:00]  Cool.  A big O for orgasm.  Hey, want a lap dance?  Okay.  Oh.  Wow.  Thanks.  Rinding away on Jimmy.  She's really a very, very pretty girl.  Well, I like her a lot.  No, are you spanking or what?  Oh, no, I'm sitting here enjoying.  I can't spank from this position because your hiney is too close.  You don't ever say you can't spank from this position.  You can spank from any position.  That's right.  That's a can-do attitude.  Now, look at her.  The attitude this country was built on.  Wonderful. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, oh.  Oh, you got a kiss in that one.  But I was nice.  I didn't look dirty.  That was a pleasant little...  Yeah, if you would have slobbered, I might have hit you with this.  I wouldn't slobber.  I'm a nice guy.  I don't like a vibrator between his legs.  All right.  Are we going to get a little spank going?  She's doing something, so I'm not going to interrupt her.  All right.  There you go.  Spank her while she uses the vibrator.  Ow!  How about we mic her?  Ow!  Fellas.  There we go.  You have to mic the hiney, too.  You got the hiney mic.  You can kind of hear that.  Ow! 
[01:24:00]  Friday.  You're next.  Is that too rough?  I think I have a plant on my end.  Yeah, you do.  I didn't do that hard, either.  Sorry.  I apologize.  Wow, that's red.  Turn around.  Look at little Jimmy's handprint on her butt.  I really didn't mean to do it hard.  Oh, my God.  I didn't do it that hard.  I just...  I can't help it.  I'm a little fella.  Oh!  Totally got his handprint on your ass.  Well, she's just...  Someone's naughty.  Well, people are calling in, and they just want to tell everyone where they're dropping  their loads today.  John on Long Island.  Yes, John.  Where, John? 
[01:24:30]  Go ahead, John.  Hey, what's up, man?  I just dropped my load on the cross-bronks.  Look at the sick shit.  He lost his load on the cross-bronks, Anthony.  That's our new radio bit.  Leave it on the side of the road.  Some Puerto Ricans will steal it, you.  Call in and tell us where you lost your load on the O.B.  and Anthony program.  Pat from Omaha.  What's up, Pat?  Hey, man.  It's awfully hard to drive an 18-wheeler while you're beating your meat and cleaning the  fucking mess up afterwards.  Well, good luck to you.  I got a new...  Clean the mess up.  ...it's all come to me.  Smell like gum to you. 
[01:25:00]  Jesus.  Jim in Tennessee.  Go ahead, Jim.  Hey, guys.  I drive a tour bus, and I bought one of these XM radios about three months ago.  Yeah.  And I'm a hollering group of people, and they can't see the earbuds, mate.  I'm driving along, and I'm just laughing for no reason at all.  It scared the shit out of these people.  You look like a mental patient.  Yeah, that's some of the best money I've ever spent.  Oh, right on.  And it's really hard to hollering group of people when you're dead. 
[01:25:30]  It's hard to listen to these girls eat each other.  Dude, they're so hot, both of them.  They really are sexy.  We'll have pictures up on opiananthony.com later this weekend or later tonight.  I really enjoy the hell out of your show.  I'll punch it out.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Well, Tom from Ohio.  Yes, Tom?  Hey, guys.  I was wondering if you guys could turn me on to any of the tech guys around here and tell  me how to get a load out of a Sky-Fi.  Get the load off the Sky-Fi?  Yeah.  Very good.  All right.  This is the greatest, these two. 
[01:26:00]  The best.  Unbelievable, actually.  They're both fantastic.  Friday looks all bored because no one's paying attention to her in the corner.  No, I'm done.  She just nutted.  I'm rested.  Yeah.  She busted one, so she's resting.  She's just trying to come back to reality, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Very good.  Should we take a break, I guess?  No.  I'm in love with Mackenzie's beauty.  She's absolutely cool.  She's fantastic.  You guys think you could work up one last thing before we get out of here for the weekend?  We only have like 10 minutes left on the show.  Okay, yeah. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  What do you want?  Maybe you guys go huddle and try to figure something out?  You huddle, you huddle, huddle.  The words of Opie and Anthony.  All right.  Nathaniel put together a pop culture quiz for old Jimmy Norm.  I've turned it over, so he couldn't cheat.  This is round one.  I guess they're going to get harder.  Yeah, Jimmy is really a pop culture retard.  We've learned this over the course of time.  He knows nothing.  We bring up things that everyone knows about just by watching TV, reading the papers, entertainment 
[01:27:00]  magazines, and not even really pawing over this stuff, but you kind of just pick it up  through your life, through living in this time.  But he, for some reason, this just blows right past him.  Something else is more important than any of this, and he just blows it off.  It's called pornography.  Exactly.  I was going to say, he knows the ins and outs of prostitution.  Yeah.  You should give us a prostitution quiz.  Okay.  That would be pretty funny, actually.  All right. 
[01:27:30]  Let me find my buzzer so I can actually do this properly.  That's too judgmental.  No.  There's ten questions.  How many do you think, Ben?  Oh, yeah.  Let's think.  Jim, you're going to be serious, right?  There's a couple on there that some people couldn't get.  It was fun putting this together as we were all talking about what Jim would know and what  Jim would know.  I think I would have missed a couple.  There's a couple on there that...  Hawk, get that goddamn buzzer or you're out. 
[01:28:00]  Hawk, I can't find my buzzer.  You're out, Hawk.  Maybe I could help.  Is that on the sound effect?  This one?  Try it, Ben.  Let me see.  Try it.  Hawk is very good at his job.  Oh, it does work.  Look at the booth.  All right, they're laughing.  They're laughing in the booth.  All right, here we go.  There's probably, I would say, three there that most people are kind of hard.  But the rest of them are.  All right, Jimmy, you ready?  I say Jimmy will get... 
[01:28:30]  Let me look quickly.  No.  Let me look over those.  I'll miss this one.  I think he's going to get seven out of ten.  Let me see.  Hold on.  You think so?  I think he'll get seven.  He'll miss this one.  Hold on.  He'll miss this.  He will miss this one.  He'll definitely miss...  What numbers?  You can tell, Opie, because...  He'll miss this.  Hold on.  He doesn't have it in front of him.  He's going to miss nine, eight, and seven.  Let me see that.  No, I have him missing a lot more.  And six.  Uh-oh.  You're only going to get six right, Jimmy.  No, Opie, I...  Oh, forget it.  He's going to get... 
[01:29:00]  Wait, six, seven...  The only wrong question is the one not asked.  Oh, my God.  You're going to get that one wrong.  Oh, my God.  What is a passing grade in the only school?  60.  60.  The D was always passing.  I have him only getting four correct.  I think one is correct.  I have him getting six wrong.  Anthony, I got a...  I'm going to say five.  Really?  Yeah, I was as high as seven, but...  Seven?  Six, seven, eight, nine, and ten are just going to be a disaster.  I say two?  No way.  Two?  Two he's not going to get.  Two he won't. 
[01:29:30]  I would say he won't get two either.  I think he might.  Eight, okay, but definitely not five, six, seven, eight, nine, and probably not ten.  All right, Jim Norton's pop culture quiz, round one.  Who is Jessica Simpson married to?  And he's being...  No, I'm not fucking around.  Nick Lachey.  Wow.  All right.  Okay, he gets that one.  I knew the Nick part. 
[01:30:00]  I just was trying to think of Lachey.  Shut up.  All right.  And I'm trying to explain my thought process.  No one cares, fat tits.  Go ahead, Anthony.  You give him the second one there.  What TV series is about a young Hollywood star and his entourage?  Entourage.  Oh, okay.  He gets that one right.  That was a little trick question.  That was a trick question.  I thought he wasn't going to get it.  I love the face Jimmy makes all confident.  He's all confident.  I laugh at entourage.  Come on, let's go.  All right.  What was the name of the last Star Wars movie? 
[01:30:30]  Revenge of the Sith.  Oh, wow.  I had him get it.  I had him get it.  Did you see this list?  Did you see the list?  No.  No?  I'm just not a complete moron, dude.  Did you?  No, you are.  I didn't think he would get that one right.  Were you in the studio the whole time?  I promise you I didn't.  I don't care if I get him wrong, dude.  Actually, I admit that I'm not really pop culture.  No, it's not fun for me to cheat.  I expected him to pretty much get the first five right.  It's the last five that are going to be the last. 
[01:31:00]  I think he's going to get the first four right.  You don't think he gets five?  No.  I think he gets...  No.  I think he misses five, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten.  Talk about him like he's ten.  I like that.  All right.  This is the last one he probably gets right, and then he doesn't get any more.  I don't think he'll get this one right.  You don't think he'll get this?  Okay.  What band sings the song American Idiot?  No idea.  No idea.  No.  For what?  You have no idea.  I certainly don't. 
[01:31:30]  Well, I had him getting this one.  No.  You want to take a guess?  Nope.  Do we have American Idiot?  Yeah, let me hear it.  Play a little of it.  See if he can get it after he hears it.  But you've already forfeited the question.  Wait, no, I have to hear it.  Well, now you would get it, I think.  No, we wouldn't.  No?  Wait, no, there's no lyrics.  Hold on, hold on.  Don't want to be an American Idiot.  Don't want to nation under the new media.  I know this song, but I don't know the name of that. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, because a lot of singers sing like this guy.  No, I know.  I just like him.  Because so many singers sound like their nose is clogged.  It's Ozzy.  Ah, it's a little band called 1942.  A little band from a little movie.  And no picture?  They bleeped fucking...  They bleeped the word fuck?  That must have been for the station that can't play the fuck word, right?  Yeah, no, there's probably two versions of it.  It's satellite radio, though.  Jesus.  We can handle a fuck on satellite radio.  There's happy, peppy satellite stations that don't play the fuck word.  What is that? 
[01:32:30]  I don't know.  It's Green Day.  That is Green Day.  No idea.  Wow.  Your first...  Oh, Jimmy.  I've heard that song, though, but I just don't care about it.  It's not a bad song.  Jimmy, do you watch The Simpsons?  Never.  All right.  All right.  But they've been on TV for, what, 12 years?  Have they?  How long now?  16 years?  Yeah.  16 years.  16 years they've been on.  Jimmy, name all three kids in The Simpsons family. 
[01:33:00]  I know Bart and Lisa.  All right.  And I honestly didn't know there was a third one.  The baby.  I don't know the kid's name.  The baby.  Don't know.  You've got to name all three.  There's no partial credit on this question.  I don't know it.  Fred?  What is it?  It's Little Maggie.  Never would have known that.  Never would have known that.  Wow.  Okay.  All right.  This is probably the toughest question on the sheet here.  All right.  You know there's a remake coming out of the Dukes of Hazzard movie. 
[01:33:30]  Did not know that.  Nor will I say it.  You knew that.  No, I didn't.  I'm not alive.  Let's just move on to question seven.  Well, let me hear.  Wait, you really didn't know they were remaking the Dukes of Hazzard?  No.  Come on, Jim.  I swear to God, dude.  Are you serious?  No.  With Jessica Simpson, the commercials have been all over the place.  No idea.  I haven't seen the video.  I haven't had a video.  I haven't had a TV in three weeks.  Should I move?  I sold my TV.  My new one's coming next week.  Three weeks.  This has been...  Dude, everything hasn't happened in the past three weeks.  What's the question? 
[01:34:00]  All right.  Who plays...  Nick Lachey.  Who plays Bo and Luke Duke in the new Dukes of Hazzard movie?  I would have gotten one out of two.  Wait, wait, wait.  Bo and Luke Duke.  And I like the other actor.  I always forget his name, though.  Owen Wilson and Joel Steinberg.  Pete Chains, Lisa, up in her little Daisy Dukes.  What's the answer?  I don't know.  It is Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville. 
[01:34:30]  Name one other movie that Sean William Scott was in.  I couldn't tell you his name right now again if you said it to me.  I never heard of him.  You never heard of him?  You never heard of him.  He's one of those young go-getters in Hollywood.  American Pie movies.  I've never seen it.  I know the movie.  Stifler.  Old school.  None of them.  All right.  None of them I've seen.  All right.  Let's go to question seven.  Who was the female lead in the Dark Angels series?  Queen Latifah. 
[01:35:00]  Wait.  Do you know, though?  No.  I've never seen that crap.  I'll give you a hint.  Her shoulder stinks.  Oh, was she at Alba?  Jessica Alba.  We can't give it to her.  No, we can't give it to her.  Absolutely not.  That's another wrong one.  I swear he will not get it.  He got the first four, or the first three.  Boy, I was giving you that Green Day one.  I was too, man.  I was too.  I was giving him the Simpsons. 
[01:35:30]  No, I definitely wasn't giving him the Simpsons.  All right.  Here we go.  Question number eight.  Jimmy.  Yes.  Your pop culture quiz, which you're doing miserably on.  X and Y is the most recent album from what band?  From what band?  X and Y?  X.  Right.  And Y, yeah.  Uh, Bam's Brothers Band?  No idea.  Wow.  X and Y.  Oh, the Z's. 
[01:36:00]  ZZ Top.  Yeah.  No, that would be Coldplay.  Ugh.  Never heard a song.  I wouldn't know one fucking...  If you said to me...  You know Coldplay songs.  Come on.  You can, you can, uh...  How about, uh...  What about Clocks?  That's not from this album, but...  It was a big hit.  Speedus.  This song.  Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  You know this one?  Wait.  I gotta hear the hook. 
[01:36:30]  This is the Chariot of Fire theme.  Faggot-y nonsense this is.  Only one of the biggest songs of the last ten years.  When he starts singing, I...  You must have heard this before.  Yes, I have heard this.  Okay, good.  Oh, you're getting hammered, Opie.  Sean William Scott was not in Old School.  Fuck yeah, he was.  Told you. 
[01:37:00]  Two different people said he wasn't.  Too tall, Joe.  Dude, where's my car?  Dude, where's my car?  Road trip.  Dude, hold on a minute.  He gave...  He gave mouth-to-mouth to Will Ferrell.  Yeah, he is in that.  Whoa.  Yeah, he is in that.  That is him.  Why didn't people go to Internet Movie Database?  IMDB.  He was...  Yeah, he's the guy that shoots himself, uh...  He shoots him with the tranquilizer.  He's in the movie for...  Maybe that's not a great example of his work, because he's only in the movie for like two  minutes, but...  But he's in it. 
[01:37:30]  All right, here we go, here we go.  Rob from Jersey.  What part did Sean William Scott play in Old School, Opie, you moron?  Their phones went nuts, too.  And, uh...  Sean William Scott wasn't in Old School.  That's Eric from New Hampshire.  He played Peppers.  He is in Old School.  Oops, right.  Wow.  Rob from Jersey.  You dick.  There you go.  John, Denise, they're killing me on the phones, too.  Yeah.  Killing me.  He's in it for a couple scenes. 
[01:38:00]  He's really...  Uh, Denise.  Yeah?  Hello.  Hi, Denise.  Okay, yeah, you're right.  Okay.  Ah, you stupid bitch.  I love these people that are just so quick to jump down our throats.  And I'm driving in the car, so I couldn't look on the internet, but I was just like,  I've seen it 50 times.  God, I've seen it.  And you know what?  As soon as Anne said, you know, I started panicking, like, uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh, John and PA. 
[01:38:30]  Click.  Okay, back to Jim's pop culture quiz.  Yes, number nine.  We're up to question number nine for those of you keeping tabs at home.  Can we just move on to ten?  There's no way he's getting this.  Who were the winner and runner-up for this year's American Idol?  Runner-up was Bo, and the winner was Carrie.  Damn!  I was looking for last names, too.  But for Jimmy, I will give that to him. 
[01:39:00]  I would definitely give him that.  Absolutely.  All right.  Bo Diddley and Carrie Fisher.  I would have messed up his last name, I think.  Wow.  Bo Bice.  There's one I never would have thought you would get.  No.  Carrie Underwood.  Yeah.  Jeez.  Anthony makes a good point from California.  Anthony!  Hey, what's up, sweet cheeks?  Hi.  What's Bo George's real name?  George O'Dowd, sissy.  Yeah.  Who doesn't know that?  He knows pop culture from 20 years ago.  I do. 
[01:39:30]  He's a pop culture archaeologist.  Everything about Black Sabbath, no problem.  All right, and the final question.  What is the name of the new PlayStation Portable unit?  PlayStation 3.  Wait.  He's scared.  Give him another chance.  I panicked because I saw the button.  The PlayStation Fun Pack?  We would have accepted PlayStation Portable or the PSP. 
[01:40:00]  P.S.P.  Weren't you listening when we were doing, what was it, Gamefly?  Yeah.  Gamefly.com?  And I seem to have hit it right on the head.  Four.  Good job, Anthony.  Four, correct.  Not the four I thought, but...  I got a couple of questions for you guys.  I just threw six of them together.  I don't have ten.  Oh, boy.  There we go.  Maybe you can...  What time are we breaking? 
[01:40:30]  How much time do we have for a break?  Whatever.  We'll do that.  Give us six, and then if you can think up a few more.  Tim didn't want to get...  Tim didn't...  He didn't feel good about getting smashed.  I know.  No, no, no.  I didn't mind getting smashed.  It just...  It all depends on what's important to you.  That's what I mean.  All right.  All right.  All right.  What cover song appears on some versions of Black Sabbath's first album?  Some versions of the album.  Wow.  It's a cover song.  It's a cover song.  It appears on some versions of their first album.  A kiss song?  No.  No, it's a cover song.  It's something like...  By the Yardbirds or something like that? 
[01:41:00]  What's that mean?  I don't know who it's by.  I just know that Ozzy did not write it, or Sabbath didn't write it.  And Ozzy hates it, and he shouldn't.  Hmm.  Paranoid?  I, Jimmy, have no idea.  Okay.  I will...  Two buzzers.  One for me, one for Opie.  All right.  Yeah, we have to...  You guys have to answer.  You have to make sure we all know that's our case.  Evil woman.  All right.  Let's see you guys on this one.  Evil woman?  You don't know who did evil woman, though?  Nope.  Santana.  Okay.  I didn't know.  Robert Duvall's first film. 
[01:41:30]  Jesus.  Oh.  You should know that one.  Robert Duvall, Duvall's first film.  He had hair, obviously.  Yeah.  Black and white.  Was it black and white?  I don't know.  Not even a hint.  No.  Wow.  Did he have a small part in On the Waterfront?  Yes.  He played the doc.  Look at how pissed Jimmy gets.  He just wants to smash his back.  I know.  No, these are not...  Good job.  Let's see. 
[01:42:00]  On the Waterfront.  Just thinking as you look to the left of the screen.  Oh, stop.  No, I already got it wrong.  I'm out.  Did you like the answer?  Yes.  To Kill a Mockingbird.  He was Boo Radley.  Oh.  Non-speaking part.  Very good.  All right.  How about this one?  Another very famous guy.  What was the name of Martin Sheen's first film?  This is in pop culture, though.  No, I'm just saying.  It all depends on what's important to you.  That's what I mean.  Martin Sheen's first film?  Yeah.  These are all movie questions and stuff.  And they're not that obscure.  I mean, they are pretty famous guys I'm talking about.  Obviously, before Apocalypse Now.  Yeah. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  Again, I think black and white.  I'll give you a hint.  It also had Tony Massanti and Ed McMahon.  Jesus.  Ed McMahon.  Ed McMahon.  Twelve angry men?  No, I'm thinking it had to do with...  Evil Woman was ELO?  Oh, I have no idea who it is.  Is it one of those Cold War movies?  No.  No?  Not at all.  Yeah.  Okay.  Evil Woman, it was the ELO version.  Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice.  There you go. 
[01:43:00]  No.  There was a film called The Incident.  The Incident.  But you know how many people say I don't own their cars, though?  Let them.  I don't care what they say in their cars.  I don't care if they're in their cars, and then they go, oh, no, a pole.  That's okay.  I don't care.  We'll take our beating.  You're not getting a beating, though.  It's not about that.  You're not supposed to know this.  What do we got?  Two more?  Three more.  All right.  What chapter, and this is a legendary question, was left out of the film version of A Clockwork  Orange?  Wow.  Chapter seven.  No.  I had no idea. 
[01:43:30]  It was 21 chapters, and it's a legendary lost 21st chapter of the book, which completely  changed any of the film, was left out of the script.  I had no idea.  What little film?  A very kind of a...  A little film?  What little film did Al Pacino do with Gene Hackman?  Hold on.  I want to just say, you turned our cute little, fun little bit into a disaster.  No, I didn't.  I'm going to get...  You're making us feel bad about ourselves?  No.  You're...  That was supposed to be a cute little pop culture quiz.  Well, Nathaniel's not here.  Or I'd get him in here. 
[01:44:00]  Believe me.  All right.  Go ahead.  All right.  What film did Al Pacino and Gene Hackman do together?  Hmm.  Yeah.  Here's my brain thinking.  I love that one.  No, it's Scarface meets The Poseidon Adventure.  Oh, very good at it.  I have no idea.  It was Popeye Doyle.  Hoo-ah!  Hoo-ah!  Scarecrow.  Oh, Scarecrow, of course.  What?  And what 1960s song did Kiss cover on their Love Gun album? 
[01:44:30]  Hmm.  And very well, I might add.  This one, a lot of people probably do know.  Kiss fans especially.  Sure.  I had that album, too.  Love Potion No. 9?  Ha-ha-ha!  60s song.  No!  Nope.  And then she kissed me.  Then he kissed me, they covered, but they made it, and then she kissed me.  Who did it originally?  Uh, with the Shirelles or something.  I love those fans.  Wow.  And then he kissed me, you know.  Ba-da-da-da-da-da. 
[01:45:00]  All right, Jimmy.  We're not as smart as you.  No, it's not about being smart.  It's about what's important to you.  That was my point with this.  These are weird questions, but pop culture is not important to me.  Right.  All right.  Gee.  Boy, I feel pretty good about myself right now.  Thanks, Jimmy.  I just want you guys to know that...  You know where I'm sitting right now?  In my place.  And I was put there by Mr. Jimmy Norton.  One guy said he only got three out of ten.  I'm impressed with three out of ten as far as those questions go.  Go ahead, blues man. 
[01:45:30]  No, I think you need the pop culture questions.  I'm beginning to feel bad because little Jimmy Norton just stopped me because he knew the ones I didn't and I actually knew what the PSP was.  Oh, wait.  You only got three out of ten out of Jimmy Norton's quiz?  I only asked six.  No, no, no.  Of the pop culture.  Oh, I'm sorry.  The pop culture.  Yeah, of course, because we did ten there.  Yeah, Jimmy dropped me.  Little Jimmy, you know, joy kits just dropped the shit out of me on that.  All right.  Very good.  But, you know what, dude?  I was purposely creating questions that I knew the answers to.  You know what I mean?  It's not like if all three of us had to answer the same level of tough questions, I would be, you know, fucked. 
[01:46:00]  By the way, Martin Sheen was in Ten Blocks on the Camino Real in 1966 before he was in The Incident in 67.  Okay, I stand corrected.  All right.  I meant to say second film.  I feel a little better about myself.  Give me an X.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Hi.  Hey, ELO did Evil Woman.  Evil Ways was fantastic.  Oh, you're right.  Evil Ways.  I'm sorry.  Hey, I love you guys, by the way.  I'm a converted Howard Stern fan.  Thanks, buddy.  I was converting Howard Stern. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, wait a minute.  Tell him, Fred.  Tell him, Fred.  All right, thanks, buddy.  He ain't saying shit.  All right, very good.  Hey, this is Laszlo from The Technophile and Grand Theft Auto.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony with a wow sticker, some air guitar, and a roofie.  Shit sucks.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right, let's get Martini Steve back in studio today.  Oh, why?  Well, we got the Tom Sizemore sex tapes or sex tape, and I don't know much about this.  I still haven't seen it.  Where did it come from? 
[01:47:00]  I don't know.  We'll get all the details from Steve.  This is what satellite radio is all about.  We can play this unedited.  There's a copy of it on my desk.  I haven't taken it home yet.  Yeah.  Take a look-see.  You want to go on IMDb and explain some of the movies that Tom Sizemore was in it?  Tom Sizemore.  You know Tom Sizemore.  You know Tom Sizemore.  You know Tom Sizemore.  You know Tom Sizemore.  You know Tom Sizemore.  He was in Blackhawk Down.  He was in Saving Private Ryan.  Saving Private Ryan.  You might remember that.  A little movie called Saving Private Ryan. 
[01:47:30]  True Romance.  Isn't that one?  Natural Born Killers.  Passenger 57.  Point Break.  He was a cop, by the way.  If you don't know who he is, he was a cop in Natural Born Killers who finally sits in a cell with Juliette Lewis.  And what is she, attack him or something?  He tries to bang her and she attacks him?  Yeah, I think so, right?  Yeah.  He's great.  And then Born on the Fourth of July.  Who was he in that?  He was a vet. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, okay.  Maybe it was a small part.  Probably was early on in his career.  And he was Sergeant Vinny Ventresca on China Beach.  Remember that series, China Beach?  Okay.  So what happened to him?  Well, he's had some problems.  He went out with Heidi Fleiss, too, right?  Very briefly, yeah.  Very briefly.  Had a few problems with the cocaine.  He seems to like the cocaine.  The booze.  The booze.  He's had some domestic problems. 
[01:48:30]  Been arrested for him.  Jailed.  He's on probation.  He violated that probation or is it parole that you violate?  I don't know.  Maybe it's both.  He also got caught with a fake penis, right?  Yeah.  He was supposed to take a drug test and he had some kind of fake penis.  Penis that is specially made for passing your drug test.  You fill it up with urine and it keeps it warm and it looks like a real penis.  So if they're watching you actually take a leak into the cup, you pull out this fake penis and take a leak with it. 
[01:49:00]  And they found out he was using the fake penis.  All right.  So he decided to make what?  Sex tapes?  Yeah.  I think these were made in, I think, 2003.  He makes reference to that at some point in the tape.  And I'm sure at the time he wasn't planning on releasing them publicly.  But he was videotaping himself having sex with Hollywood hookers, which are essentially porn stars.  Yeah.  Or porn actresses.  And they get... 
[01:49:30]  Stupid phone.  What kind of ringtone?  He's got the oldie style.  It's one that's about to get turned off.  Who's calling you?  I don't know.  Who's calling you during the show?  I don't know.  Someone...  I will bet you anything it's my father who's calling me.  Steve has a rotary cell phone.  I certainly do.  It's the wife calling.  There's a young blonde girl in our child's bed.  I...  There it is.  Wow.  Good one. 
[01:50:00]  Wow.  Okay.  I saw these tapes.  They're just...  Just right.  All right.  Focus.  Focus.  Steve.  You're losing it.  Don't worry about your dumb cell phone.  I'm turning it off.  All right.  So they don't do that again.  Okay.  Who was that?  The berry delivery person?  Ten pounds of berries.  So how did the tapes get out there?  Tom Sizemore is broke and needs money.  He's going to jail for violating his parole. 
[01:50:30]  And he's in rehab now, I think.  And he is...  He needs money.  That's the reason...  That's the only reason tapes that are this long with this much footage on it get out.  It's because the person that's in them had some intention of releasing them and making  a profit off them.  Wow.  That don't look that bad.  That chick doesn't look too bad on him.  But, I mean, what happens to you after Hollywood spits you out?  You have his nose buried up our ass?  That's great.  These are very, very brutally graphic. 
[01:51:00]  He looks all drugged out and stuff.  Yeah.  What a good guy.  Well, we got the audio of the tapes.  And there's some classic, classic audio here.  The first one, Tom introduces himself.  What's this about, Steve?  Just a brief little introduction to establish who the person in the thing is.  And he's, you know, sort of mumbling.  Obviously, it helps to have the video in front of you when you're watching it because his eyes  are all glazed over.  Right.  He's, you know, has big bags under his eyes.  He's obviously been up for a few days.  They know they're being filmed, right?  Yeah, this is not hidden camera. 
[01:51:30]  He's holding the camera and pointing it at his face.  And some of these, it's a two or three camera shoot.  He's got porn chicks on either side of him operating cameras while he's eating ass or,  you know, getting a rim job.  So this is not hidden camera work.  Wow.  All right, let's start with the first clip.  My name's Tom Sizemore.  I didn't do it.  I deny all culpability.  I wasn't there.  It hasn't been even remotely fair. 
[01:52:00]  Okay.  So stick around.  Have a good time.  Mike, have a good time.  All right, so that's the intro.  That's the intro.  What was he doing during that?  Just kind of hanging out?  That was, he's about to get busy with two or three girls in one bed.  And, yeah, he's just, you know, he's just introing his home movie.  All right, here's the next clip.  It's February 2003. 
[01:52:30]  I dyed my hair at Rancho Labrie.  That rhymes.  And I did.  And a couple of the girls there bleached my hair.  And guess what else I did at Rancho Labrie?  I fucked a whole bunch of the girls there.  And you're not supposed to.  You know why?  Because it's rehab.  But I didn't think my company didn't need rehab at all.  It was fine, and I found out that it was doing just fine.  I hadn't met Kara yet, so that doesn't count as cheating.  That counts as me getting laid. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, my God.  Wow.  So he was getting laid in rehab.  Yeah, Rancho Labrie is this little isolated, posh rehab center in California.  Okay.  How do you not love Tom Sizemore already?  Oh, he's the best.  Wait till you hear track six.  Wait till you hear track six.  But first, here's track three.  He's trying to tell everyone how smart he is.  Yeah.  It's been my experience, and I'm not saying I'm smart.  I'm not very smart. 
[01:53:30]  But I'm not stupid.  Like, I know, like, Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence.  He didn't write the Constitution.  See, that was a whole bunch of guys.  Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Paine, Benjamin Franklin, a whole bunch of guys.  They were called the founding fathers.  How about that?  And they wrote it by where?  What city?  Philadelphia.  See, good for me.  And, like, you know what I paid attention to in school? 
[01:54:00]  Whose tits were getting bigger.  That was, like, my main...  I'm just being honest.  That's what basically everybody's thinking about.  You know?  Is he talking to anybody?  He's talking to the camera.  You've got to understand the setup here.  He's talking to the camera while a girl is going down on him.  Oh, you didn't explain that.  Sorry.  That's a big one, Steve.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Makes it a little more interesting to listen to.  While a girl is going down on him.  In fact, he's engaged in some kind of sex act during a lot of this.  And a girl is going down on him, and he's just in and out of some alcoholic and drug-induced stupor. 
[01:54:30]  So his mind is wandering all over the place.  The first one was too cold.  It certainly was.  Jimmy.  It starts to get good here.  So here's more Tom Sizemore.  You know what you would do if you were me?  He'd let Kara suck your cock.  All right.  What would you say?  Hey, stop it.  How dare you? 
[01:55:00]  I'm unmarried.  I don't have a girlfriend.  Why do you want to do this to me?  Why are you offending my sense of...  Why is she doing this to me?  What's wrong with her?  She has a disease.  It's called a cox...  She's a cox sucker.  Do you know what I'm saying?  Look, in all seriousness, truth be told...  What's she doing the act there? 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  She's actually pulling his pants down even further and going down on him while he's doing that.  What's he packing?  Not much.  Why would you release that?  Not much because he's broke.  He's hung like an acorn.  He's got movies coming out.  He's got five movies and post-production here.  Six if you count this one.  Pre-production and two, three in post.  Yeah.  Counting this one.  Those will all be direct-to-video.  You ask.  See, I wish people would buy a movie because I'd certainly love to release it.  I'd love people to see my delicious surprise. 
[01:56:00]  There are sequences in this where he just gets on all fours in front of the camera.  And just spreads cheek.  And just shows off his ass.  You've got to love that.  We're almost up to track six.  But first, it's track five.  He bashes Heidi Fleiss here, right?  Yeah.  Having my choice between sucking a cock, I mean, having my cock sucked, and going to  jail, I'm going to pick having my cock sucked.  Giving a choice between going to war and having my cock sucked, I'm going to pick having my 
[01:56:30]  cock sucked.  Giving a choice between fucking Heidi and having my cock sucked.  Trick question.  She wasn't much for giving her head.  Oh, you know what?  This is a fictitious Heidi.  This is not the Heidi you think it is.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  I was trying to keep from being sued.  That wasn't bad.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that movie coming out.  Fly Boys with Stephen Baldwin. 
[01:57:00]  God, that's got to be good.  Oh, yeah.  Stephen Baldwin's really mysterious.  And he's got...  Oh, yeah.  These are a bunch of nobodies.  Yeah, these are all direct-to-video stuff.  He's not going to get those choice roles now anytime soon.  No more Saving Private Ryan.  Well, here we go.  Track six.  Track six.  Track six.  Come on, baby. 
[01:57:30]  Come on.  Okay, terrific.  Why was he applauding?  It's pretty disturbing, huh?  And half the time that he's doing this, he's got, you know, he, especially in this next 
[01:58:00]  track, you can see he's getting, he's getting blown.  There's a dog barking, there's a cell phone going off, and the girl that's blowing him  has a cigarette burning in one hand, and she's, you know, butted up against another girl who's  trying to sleep right next to her and just sort of not paying attention, and the camera's  being held by a third girl who's in the room because it's this above shot, and it's  obvious that nobody in the, you know, frame could be holding the camera.  Yeah.  It is just, it's a mess of bodies on this, on this hotel room bed. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, you're going to take her.  Yeah, that sounds good.  Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, what are you doing?  Oh, fuck, yeah.  A dog?  Yeah.  Dude, I filled up from that sound of her blowing. 
[01:59:00]  That slurping?  That is great.  Fuck.  It just keeps going and going and going and going.  Moaning, moaning a little, ugh.  Oh, he's kind of creepy.  Yeah, where'd you?  His moaning takes me right out of the game.  No, see, I don't mind it because he's not talking.  I, I just, I can't understand him.  I just hear her slurping, that dirty girl.  Fucking servicing.  This is sloppy.  More Tom Sizemore.  I got your camera on again. 
[01:59:30]  I'm about to commit some more crimes.  And I'm going to have sex with two women at the same time.  Right.  And then we're going to talk about something that's against the law.  Besides this here.  Which is called, this is called cunnilingus or foley fuel.  I'm not sure.  One of them means I'm not a faggot.  And one of them means I'm a faggot.  So whichever one of them means I'm not a faggot.  Oh, nothing against you faggots.  I want you to like me too.  Not that much. 
[02:00:00]  Hey, my dick is short, huh?  I'm a grower, not a shower.  Right?  I'm an eagle maniac.  God.  Wow, he is gone.  Yeah.  He has fallen.  I love him, dude.  Why do you love him?  Because he's just a raw, trying to dump a load male.  How do you not?  And he's such a good actor.  Why do you love him?  I mean, he's obviously very desperate and very sad.  Well, yeah, but he's also talented, so I kind of, you know, I just...  He was talented. 
[02:00:30]  I think he'd probably still act, but he's...  He's fallen.  I love the fact that he's just...  He's fallen hard.  But this is beautiful because he's such a mess.  He's us.  That's why I like what I'm hearing right now.  He's not like...  Can you imagine that dumb Brad Pitt did a fucking sex tape?  How he'd be polite and nice and he'd be gentle.  This fucking slob.  Chick's blowing him with a cigarette with a dog barking.  How do you not love that?  That's my life.  See, I don't have three hookers.  I have one.  I can't afford three.  I gotta go to trial.  I gotta go to trial.  It's so fucked up that I gotta go to trial. 
[02:01:00]  I'll be able to.  There's something I didn't do.  I mean, I'm breaking the law.  I'm soliciting a prostitute.  A, it's against the law.  A, but look, it's what I do.  B, I use drugs.  But, you know, not that much.  Just when I'm awake.  And C, I didn't hit her.  I didn't like her.  And the reason I broke up with her was because whenever I went to anywhere I went, she'd suck every cock in the room.  It probably kind of drains you out, you know?  Hey, LAPD. 
[02:01:30]  One more time.  I want to make this really clear.  Fuck you.  Not that I don't like you guys.  But I just feel about you how you feel about me.  You don't like me.  I don't like you.  You think I'm afraid of you?  Long guy.  Okay, suck my fucking Detroit dick.  I didn't hit that fucking clickety-clack bitch.  Vagabones coming out of her ass fucking whore.  I didn't hit her.  All right?  I shit her.  Because she asked me to.  Oh, he's a fucking classic, this dude. 
[02:02:00]  That clickety-clack bitch.  He's a clickety-clack bitch.  He's so angry.  He hates the LAPD.  That's smart.  That's real smart.  But I probably fucking gave him a hard time, this poor fella.  Just trying to walk around with his rubber dick.  Probably be left alone.  Clickety-clack bitch.  Clickety-clack bitch.  That's a whack-bag name.  That's a good one.  Clickety-clack bitch.  All right, what's the next track there, Steve?  Sweetie.  Oh, this is the setup here. 
[02:02:30]  He's in a hotel room.  He's got four porn chicks.  Everyone's naked.  There's one of those mechanical bull dildo things.  I don't know what they're called.  I want to say Zibian or something like that, but it might not.  And the girl that's riding it and him are having some in-depth discussion about how much they like pussy while he's getting blown.  And two girls are on this mechanical bull dildo.  It's a very obscure scene.  Oh, fuck yeah.  I love pussy.  It's a very obscure scene. 
[02:03:00]  Sorry, I'm odd.  Sorry, odd.  Oops.  Yeah, that's a little out of the way.  Sorry.  I was really reaching for a big word.  Is it an independent scene?  All right, smash me.  That was a bad...  This is like a real, like, film festival scene.  It's really obscure.  Obscure.  I'm hard to find.  I was reaching for a big word and I failed.  I apologize.  Oh, fuck yeah.  I love pussy.  Me too.  I love pussy.  I love pussy.  I love pussy. 
[02:03:30]  Do you love dicks too?  Oh, I like the pussies.  You like the pussies better?  Me too.  We got a lot in common.  Oh, I love a lot in common.  I love pussies too.  I love the pussies.  I love the girls stuck in my nipples.  Oh, I love pussies too.  I have a pussy too.  It's in my dick.  We are failing.  It's in my dick.  My pussy's in my dick.  If you suck it really long, forever, then it turns into a pussy.  It's weird.  It mutates into a pussy.  He's the worst.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[02:04:00]  Damn it, I hate stepping on that one.  He's a bad, dirty talker.  Oh, no.  Yeah, what was that about?  I got a dick that turns into a pussy.  Would you suck it forever?  Jesus, Tom, you're awful at this.  How do you not...  Be smooth.  I'm talking script.  I'm talking dirty.  I'll say something like, um...  That's right.  Take that you-know-what.  I like pussy.  I like honey.  I like honey.  I like honey. 
[02:04:30]  It's a very obscure...  It's a very obscure condiment.  Someone that agrees with Jim Norton.  Howard, what's up?  Yeah, I'm in total agreeance with Jimmy, man.  That just makes me like him even more as a movie star,  because he's like a regular guy, man.  You know, porn, chicks, blow.  Sure, man.  You know, that's fucking awesome.  He's not abusing the girls, you know.  He's just getting blown.  It's a high-priced girl.  I totally agree with you.  It's a bigger fan now.  Yeah, absolutely.  There's a desperation there, though.  I agree.  The guy, you know, was big in Hollywood, 
[02:05:00]  and now he's making sex tapes and releasing them on the Internet.  When you hit it big, Jimmy, in Hollywood,  don't spit all your money on hookers and blow.  Dude, I don't do any type of drugs.  Most of my money goes into having my genitals catered to, as they say.  All right.  And held, and just have a girl go,  ah-ha.  More of the Tom size, more sex tape audio.  What's this next track there, Steve?  This guy, he's so far gone.  Jim talks about having his genitals held.  This guy wants them broken off, as you'll hear in this clip.  He's getting an aggressive rim job, 
[02:05:30]  and he wants this girl to, like, tear his nuts off as she's doing it.  Oh, oh, motherfucker, yeah.  Harder.  Oh.  Oh.  Harder.  Oh, you can't do it hard enough, like breaking the motherfuckers off.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  Oh, fuck, yeah. 
[02:06:00]  Oh.  You girls are so fucking cute.  I can't get a heart on it right now, you know why?  I worry about the goddamn fucking court case.  So I don't have to worry about this court case.  I don't have to worry about the court case.  I don't have to worry about the court case.  Oh, I don't have to worry about it.  My fucking mind's fucked up. 
[02:06:30]  I need more pussy.  I just need more pussy.  I gotta get overstimulated.  It's a joke, guys.  It's a joke.  It's a joke.  All right, the obvious.  What's that noise?  Is he getting blown in a lawn doctor?  Oh, sorry.  Is he getting blown in a lawn doctor service center?  That's this big mechanical bull-looking dildo.  It's just you got one girl operating a little attenuator on the side, and it just vibrates. 
[02:07:00]  A little what on the side?  It's an attenuator.  Oh, it's that obscure thing.  For fuck's sake.  It's not a bad attenuator.  It's a new Schwarzenegger movie.  Potentiometer.  It's like a volume knob for the large fucking thing.  See, they're like 902 millibars?  Steve.  Steve.  Steve.  Let me talk.  Put it in terms so people can understand.  It's a vibrator.  It's a big riding vibrator with a volume knob on the side, if you will. 
[02:07:30]  Let's move on here.  Track 12, Steve.  What's this about?  Another monologue about how much he does not like the police, and he wants them dead,  and he gets into an argument with the young lady who's servicing him.  The hooker?  Yes.  And the hooker likes the police.  The hooker loves the police.  I've never had an STD in my life.  My camera's over here.  I'm going to say just for the record.  I have cancer of the pancreas.  I don't have chlamydia.  You know what you got cancer of? 
[02:08:00]  The police.  I have cancer of the police.  They grow on you?  No.  What day?  It's Friday, right?  And you just find a big mole and it starts growing and growing, and there's a cop that pops out?  No.  I'm hoping that over the weekend, 22 cops are murdered.  Jesus.  You say that.  I hope they have lots of kids.  Oh, come on.  The people do.  No, they're not.  The police.  The only speaking is still about people how they feel about you.  And you know what?  They have been very nice to me, truth be told.  But you should be sorry for them. 
[02:08:30]  You know what I mean?  I feel sorry.  Fuck feeling sorry for them.  They've cost me $40 million, these fucking blue hair.  Yeah, but I feel sorry for the whole system that's so fucked up that it works that way.  Well, I feel sorry for the system.  I feel sorry for the system.  Okay, I feel sad.  You make a dick shortener.  No, no, no.  What you just said to me was a dick shortener.  Okay, don't feel sorry for it.  I feel sad that our country is like that.  Because you are above that.  You see?  Give me my camera.  When a good person is persecuted.  Give me my camera.  Okay.  What, are you beating her with the camera? 
[02:09:00]  When the good son is persecuted.  Shut up, bitch.  How great.  He didn't grovel.  She's used to talking to having guys go, ah, good point.  He's like, that's a dick shortener.  Yeah, shut up.  Exactly.  The whole time they're naked, right?  Yeah, the whole time they're naked.  That's a system.  It's a shut up, whore.  That's a dick shortener.  That's a dick shortener, you blue-haired fucking dick.  All right, we got two tracks left.  This one, what does Tom Sizemore do here?  This is what he actually did in the last clip was he picked up the camera,  and no, he didn't cave her head in with it, but he did. 
[02:09:30]  He just looks into it and does a whole other rant about the system  and how he hates the system.  Uh-huh.  All right, this is, and then the last clip is Tom having a screaming orgasm.  Oh, no.  But first it's this.  For the record, I want to say, no, no, hey, no, no, I'm not mad at you.  For the record, I feel sorry for the system.  We love it.  You know why?  Because the system took all my money.  Well, listen, I got a man in change left  that some fucking lawyer is going to get from me.  And I want to say this real quickly. 
[02:10:00]  I love the police.  I think they're fly.  I think they're bomb.  Very good.  Check this out.  I think the police are nice people.  Really nice.  Can you get up my camera?  I like to hang out.  What is she saying is so nice?  Oh, she's just, she's...  Oh, because he disagreed with her before, and now she's happy that he's...  Oh, it looked like she was looking at something.  Oh.  I like to hang out with him.  Hang too far from me. 
[02:10:30]  Every day.  And smile.  Nice.  Hey, I just came in some girl's ass.  I know I'm controversial, and I don't give a fuck.  Hey, I just came in some girl's ass.  Wonderful.  He's just in a drug-induced stupor,  and his brain is just shifting all over the place,  because he can't maintain a thought for more than a couple seconds.  Where are these tapes?  Where can people find them?  There's links online.  There's links on opianthony.com.  All right, here's...  Don't be such a dick shortener.  Here's the final track of the Tom Sizemore sex tape audio. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, I'm coming, I'm coming.  I'm coming, I'm coming.  I'm coming, I'm coming.  On your faces, on your faces.  Okay.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Right there, right there, right there.  Okay.  Oh.  Oh, mother fucker.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And cut. 
[02:11:30]  Perfect.  Perfect, Tom.  A man of his size would easily have trouble coming on a face.  It's a wrap.  Wow.  Holy shit.  He's like putting him in position.  Is that what he was doing?  Yeah, it's exactly.  Get over here, sir.  Because he's lying down, he's laying down,  and he just demands that they get their faces in the way.  Good.  So he's got a cat on his knees.  Nice.  He's paying for it.  They'll eat it.  Paying a lot for it. 
[02:12:00]  Wow.  All right, well, there you have it.  The Tom Sizemore sex tapes.  Wonderful.  Well, yeah, and you won't be hearing that on terrestrial radio.  No, of course not.  You still want us to do a clean show?  Yeah.  Jesus.  All right.  You know, it was so much better when we had to kind of dodge these subjects and use double  entendre.  No.  I like hearing him say, I just came in a girl's ass.  Absolutely.  Wee!  I just got wowed.  That's a big old hootie toner. 
[02:12:30]  Let me see you.  And buddy.  It's the Opie and Anthony wow line.  If you're on the road and you get wowed, we want to know about it.  Call 866-WOW-ME-05.  That's 866-WOW-ME-05.  Tell us where, tell us when, and tell us what those delicious boobies look like.  And if your message isn't too stupid, you just might use it on the air.  Ooh!  It's the worst.  Baby, you really need to drink more.  I'm not being Anthony.  We got some audio of The Rocker. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, what is the story about this one?  Homemade lead singer audition videotape was left behind and this thing is all over the  internet now or something?  Yeah, I guess this guy wanted to be a singer.  A singer?  We're trying to get him.  And he left, uh...  Trying to get Steve in.  Steve knows everything.  Hybrid Steve.  Hi, Steve.  Hi!  Whoa!  Wow.  He almost fell.  Whoa, Steve!  You know what it is?  Normally when he sits...  Motherfuckers.  It's in a cave for the winter on a rock that's embedded in the earth. 
[02:13:30]  By the way, every time...  He's churned his wheels on it.  For now on, every time Steve comes into the studio or leaves the studio, Derek, if you will,  I want to hear that noise.  We need that one.  That's right.  Yeah, we need that on our machines, too.  All right, Steve, what's The Rocker about?  Oh, The Rocker.  Crap, I wish I had that right in front of me.  Um, it is a guy in...  Ramone is circling out outside waiting for the showdown.  Ramone. 
[02:14:00]  Drive-by hybrid.  Jesus.  Rocker.  R-A-W-K-E-R.  Uh, it is a, um...  I guess the back story is a guy...  If you've ever been to a large music store, there's always a table or a bulletin board  outside that has, um, you know, want ads for musicians.  And people leave their, uh, their, uh, their demo tapes.  Or in this case, it was a videotape with a lead singer audition on it.  Right.  And this guy left a, I guess, a pile of videotapes with his, uh, voice, with him on it, singing 
[02:14:30]  a cappella, a bunch of old rock songs.  So there's no backing tracks.  And it's just this guy just singing these tracks.  Uh, I guess there's a couple Led Zeppelin songs, a Black Sabbath song, and, uh, an ACDC  song.  And now he's famous.  And now...  It's online.  And now someone found it.  Forever and ever.  And uploaded, uploaded, uploaded the video.  And it's great.  It's getting a lot of hits all over the internet?  All over the place.  And it was done maybe three days ago, too.  Wow.  And the guy's, like, shirtless and southern.  Shirtless, southern guy.  And you can tell he's southern because he speaks with his deep... 
[02:15:00]  He sings with his deep south twang.  Okay.  Without further ado, here's Iron Man by The Rocker.  Uh-oh.  Has he lost his mind?  Can he see or is he blind?  Can he walk at all?  Or if he moves, will he fall?  Is he alive or dead?  Has he thoughts within his head?  We'll just pass him there. 
[02:15:30]  Why should we even care?  If I didn't know better, I think he was talking about Ben.  He was turned to steel in the great magnetic field where he traveled time for the future of mankind.  Mankind.  Nobody wants him.  He just stares at the world. 
[02:16:00]  Planning his vengeance.  He leaves all the way there.  That he soon will unfold.  Now the time is near for Iron Man to spread fear.  Vengeance from the grave kills a people he once saved.  Phenomenal.  Nobody wants him. 
[02:16:30]  They just turn their heads.  Nobody wants him.  Now he has his revenge.  Heavy boots of lead fills his victims full of dread.  Running as fast as they can.  Iron Man lives again. 
[02:17:00]  And there goes the rocker.  That's pretty funny.  A couple people have taken it upon themselves to do remixes.  So they'll line his vocals up with the Ozzy vocals.  Oh, clever.  Oh, really?  That's what five's all about?  Let me listen to this.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Let me see. 
[02:17:30]  You've got to eliminate the vocals, though. 
[02:18:00]  Of course you do.  The hips.  Yeah.  Is he live or dead?  Has he thought it is?  Yeah, that messes it up. 
[02:18:30]  Hey, you've got to eliminate the vocals.  Why should we?  Has he lost his mind?  Can he sing or is he blind?  Can he walk at all?  Or if he moves with the fuck?  Is he wild or dead?  Has he thought it is?  It's a high school marching band.  It's just happening there.  Why should we even care?  Nobody wants it.  He just stares like a girl. 
[02:19:00]  But he was thinking that he's going to run for.  Marching band doing that?  Yeah.  That's pretty cool, right?  Yeah.  Marching band?  He was told to steal in the great magnetic field. 
[02:19:30]  When he traveled back for the future of mankind.  Now the time is near for a man to reveal.  Vengeance from the great fields of people he once saved.  That's not bad.  I am hybrid man.  Back in 1955, man didn't know about a rock and roll show and all that jive. 
[02:20:00]  The white man had the smokes.  The black man had the blues.  Let there be rock.  Nobody knew what he was going to do, but Tchaikovsky had the news.  He said, let there be song.  And there was sound.  Let there be light.  And there was light.  I'm absolutely crying over here.  And there was drum.  Let there be guitar. 
[02:20:30]  And there was guitar.  Ow!  Let there be rock.  That guy stinks.  And it came to pass.  Rock and roll was born all across the land.  Every rock and band was blowing up a storm.  And the businessman got famous.  The guitar man got rich.  And in every bar there was a superstar with a seven-year age. 
[02:21:00]  There were 15 million fingers learning how to play.  And you could hear those things and thinking.  And this is what they had to say.  I can't take it anymore.  I cannot take it anymore.  What's the next song?  Oh, we got one more.  We got to listen to it a little bit.  He's got guts, though.  A whole lot of love.  You got to hear him do it.  Yeah, a whole lot of love.  What did you say?  He's got guts.  Guts.  He doesn't have any talent, but he's got guts.  He's got guts, and guts is enough.  He doesn't have guts. 
[02:21:30]  He's silly, and he's ignorant, but he's got guts.  Yeah.  He doesn't even know where he is.  That's pretty true.  He's got the song going through his head, but he has no idea how to keep time.  Any man brave enough to sing without any goddamn music with his guts hanging out can drink out of my mule any time.  He's got guts.  You got the video up on opanathony.com?  Yeah, it's linked.  It's linked.  It's linked.  He's silly, and he's ignorant, but he's got gas and electric, and gas and electric's enough. 
[02:22:00]  Let's hear a little bit of Whole Lotta Love.  You need cooling.  That was good.  Oh, but I ain't fooling.  I ain't fooling.  I'm going to send you back to school and way down inside.  Honey, you really need it.  I'm going to give you my love.  I'm going to give you my love.  Oh, what a whole lot of love.  What a whole lot of love.  What a whole lot of love. 
[02:22:30]  What a whole lot of love.  You've been learning.  Baby, I've been learning.  All the good times, baby, baby.  I've been yearning you.  Yeah, yearning you.  Way, way down inside.  Honey, I'm going to give you my love.  I'm going to give you every inch of my love.  Going to give you my love.  Yeah.  All right, let's go. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  What a whole lot of love.  What a whole lot of love.  What a whole lot of love.  What a whole lot of love.  Assist to Derek today.  That was great.  We have to wait for this long inch.  Guy, oh, it's still on?  Yeah.  He's been coolin'. 
[02:23:30]  Baby, I've been droolin'.  All the good times, baby, baby.  I've been misusing.  Way, way down inside.  I'm going to give you my love.  Of course you are.  I'm going to give you every inch of my love.  Going to give you my love.  Hey.  All right.  Here we go.  Yeah, let's go.  All right, we're going to go.  Here we go.  Well, we're waiting. 
[02:24:00]  Well, any fucking time, sweetheart.  Way down inside.  Woman, you need.  Don't show.  No. 
[02:24:30]  You better get your head and your ass wired together, or I will take a giant shit out of you.  What's that supposed to be, some kind of sick joke?  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Thanks for me, girl.  I want to be a backdoor man.  Hey. 
[02:25:00]  Oh.  Hey.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  God damn it.  Are you fucking with me?  I keep on calling, baby.  I keep on calling, baby.  I keep on calling, baby.  I can't calling, baby.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[02:25:30]  Oh.  All right.  Enough.  Wow.  That guy is awful.  I can't get enough of the rocker.  He's great.  The videos are pretty funny.  They're linked to opianethy.com.  Yeah.  Same song with karaoke.  We'll just do a little taste.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come on.  Come on.  You need to live for when I ain't fooling. 
[02:26:00]  I'm gonna send you back this good way.  Way down inside.  Honey, you really need it.  I'm gonna give you my love.  I'm gonna give you my love.  Oh.  What a whole lot of love.  What a whole lot of love.  What a whole lot of love.  What a whole lot of love. 
[02:26:30]  You've been learning.  Baby, I've been learning.  Are you hyper-written?  All the good times, baby, baby.  I've been learning, yeah.  Way, way down inside.  I'm gonna give you my love.  I'm gonna give you my love.  I'm gonna give you my love.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go.  What a whole lot of love.  What a whole lot of love.  What a whole lot of love. 
[02:27:00]  What a whole lot of love.  I'm gonna give you my love.  I'm gonna give you my love.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  You damn asshole. 
[02:27:30]  Shut your fucking mouth, you damn asshole.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  He stinks, and I don't like him.  Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!  Did Zeppelin have shortened that?  Wow. Short.  And that's nothing but pure and simple old-fashioned communism. 
[02:28:00]  This happens every time one of those dancers start poontanging around with those show folk fags.  Fags!  Hi, everybody. This is Huey Lewis, reminding you that you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony,  and you really ought to have something better to do.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  What?  Mr. Bridges.  Yes, sir.  How you doing?  Oh, there he is.  Sorry to make you wait. It's Bo Bridges, everyone.  Hey, Opie, hey, Anthony. 
[02:28:30]  What are we doing getting actual Hollywood stars on our show?  We don't know how to talk to a real Hollywood star.  We get the phony types.  How you guys doing?  Very good.  Good.  What do you got going for yourself these days?  Well, I'm doing Stargate.  Stargate?  Yeah.  Sci-fi.  Sci-fi show.  They're in their ninth season, and I'm joining them as General Hank Landry.  Nine years that show's been on?  Yeah.  Jesus, where does the time go?  I ain't now.  Nine seasons. 
[02:29:00]  Right.  And now you're joining the cast.  Is it the Stargate, or Stargate Atlantis, or Stargate CSI, or...?  Stargate SG-1.  SG-1.  That's the original one.  That's right.  And is MacGyver still on that show?  Richard came in and did like a couple of scenes and a couple of episodes, but he's sort  of, you know, opting out of it.  Wow.  Why would he leave?  He's doing very well with that.  Well, nine years, you know.  He helped create the show.  And I don't know. 
[02:29:30]  You'd have to ask Richard.  Wow.  Yeah.  Okay, put him on.  No?  Not there?  I've been a big fan ever since the incident.  I didn't see it live.  I mean, I was born in 68.  But I gotta say, that's a fine film.  Yeah, that was a crazy one about the subways in New York, huh?  Yeah, Martin Sheen's first film.  That was his actual first film.  Oh, yeah.  With Tony DeSante and Bulber just played the guy who got involved.  Ed McMahon.  Was that Ed McMahon's only film ever? 
[02:30:00]  It was like Tom and Carol and Bob Carroll and Ted Reynolds.  I think maybe certainly his only dramatic forte.  Now, you've been acting for a long time, and a friend of mine and I were talking about  like a lot of the way the movies are, and it seems like a lot of the stress is no longer  put on acting because a lot of the stuff, like affection, all that stuff?  A lot of the stress, you say?  Well, the effects, it seems like, have kind of replaced what you used to have to act.  Like in the 60s, you had to act because there was nothing to cover up anything. 
[02:30:30]  That's why a lot of you guys from those days are great.  And it seems like today, there's so many effects and other things that will just cover up for  a lack of like, you know, what would have passed back then.  Well, hopefully they won't, you know, where it all ends, they'll digit, I can't even pronounce  the word, digitalizes.  Or, yeah, digitize.  Either one is good, especially on this show.  I'll have to get into voice-overs or something, I suppose.  You've done a lot of great work.  He was in Norma Rae, Grease Lightning. 
[02:31:00]  You just had a fantastic career.  I mean, what did you start in, 48?  It was like your first role?  Yeah, I think around that time I was in a film called Zamba, which comes on, on TV every  once in a while where I was chasing around in the jungle with a gorilla named Zamba.  Ah.  Zamba the gorilla, sure.  There's lots of me calling out, Zamba, Zamba.  Now, obviously you're Jeff's brother.  Every role he plays lately, it just seems like he plays a complete maniac. 
[02:31:30]  He's nothing like that, I would hope.  No, now, my mother wouldn't like to hear you say that because he also played the President  of the United States.  Really?  Pretty calm and collected in that one.  I can't look at him...  Yeah, he does like those crazy guys, doesn't he?  I can't look at him without thinking of the remake of The Vanishing with Kiefer Sutherland.  Oh, yeah.  It was frightening, man.  I liked that one.  That was pretty bizarre.  He got hit with his face and the shovel goes into his face and all that.  Hey, have you seen any of his performances from the Dinah Shore show?  Mm-mm. 
[02:32:00]  Any of your brother's performances?  No, I haven't.  I remember him doing that.  Yeah, we recently got a DVD and it's a bunch of singing performances by celebrities on the  Dinah Shore show.  Oh, yeah.  He must have been like 16 or 17.  Oh, my God.  Well, I don't know.  He had this big head of hair and beard.  I think it was during King Kong.  Uh-huh.  Might have been during that one.  Oh, okay.  So he wasn't like a kid.  No, no.  But it was one of those performances that are kind of like, oof.  Yeah, he's gotten into music quite a bit. 
[02:32:30]  He came out with an album with Michael McDonald recently.  Really?  That he wrote a lot of, Jeff wrote a lot of the music for and stuff.  He's always loved music, yeah.  Do you guys have any competitive stuff going?  Because, I mean, you know, you're both very, very famous and both very respected actors.  Not really, because, you know, first of all, we both feel quite blessed and fortunate to  have been able to make a living in this business, which is such a crazy biz.  And also, I'm a bit older than Jeff, so in a lot of ways, because my dad was traveling 
[02:33:00]  a lot with work when we'd stay home as kids, I would do a lot of the father stuff with him.  So I kind of, you know, I enjoy all of his successes and so forth, because I taught him  everything he knows.  Well, you're also very musical.  I mean, it says here in the bio that you play guitar.  I'm not particularly musical.  Yeah, I love music.  I do. 
[02:33:30]  I like to play it.  I'm not quite like when Jeff and I did the Fabulous Baker Boys together.  Ah, yes.  We played all our own piano in it.  But Jeff can really, I mean, he still can play all of Dave Grusin jazz music for that.  And I had to just kill myself to learn a few bars.  I can like, I can chord with my left hand and play melody with my right, so I'm okay at  parties for an hour or so.  But that's about it. 
[02:34:00]  Hey, Bo, how's your son Todd doing?  We haven't heard from him in a while.  Todd.  Yeah, I think Todd's not my son, but he's, from what I understand, he's doing okay now,  Todd Bridges.  Yeah, but a lot of people think he's my son, but no.  No, huh?  No.  I think that's great that you're still going strong in this new thing.  Because I do a little bit of acting, too, although I'm not particularly very good.  I tend to just make eye contact with the camera, and then the director has to go talk.  Yeah, that's the first thing you don't want to do. 
[02:34:30]  Are you Meisner or Method, can I ask you that?  What is that?  Either or, Meisner or Method actor?  Well, my dad was my teacher, and he was, you know, sort of a Stanislavski guy, you know,  the Stanislavski method.  So I learned a lot of that path from him.  Stanislavski?  Yes.  As opposed to Boleslavski, which was another Method actor.  Really?  Now, Boleslavski.  Geez, now you're talking.  Oh, my God. 
[02:35:00]  We got an anchor from CNBC in the studio today, sir.  And he's boring the hell out of us.  Yeah, Boleslavski.  In fact, I just gave my nephew a book written by him.  He was one of Stanislavski's students, and he wrote a book called Acting the First Six Lessons.  And it's a great one.  You ought to get it.  It's fun.  The first lesson is do not look into the camera.  Oh.  That's what I kind of do.  I try to, like, avoid all voice inflection and emotion. 
[02:35:30]  I figure just spit the words out quickly, and then let the audience decide what I meant.  There you go.  Hey, how do you feel?  I mean, again, I would classify you as an absolutely real actor and, like, an old-school guy.  How do you feel about all the remakes and just the shit that they're throwing out at people?  Well, I mean, I've certainly done my share of shite.  You know, I think the most important aspect to any entertainment that tells a story is the story itself. 
[02:36:00]  But if it's a good one, then it probably will be retold several times, you know?  What goes through your mind when you're part of a project that you just know is awful, but you're under contract and you've got to, you know, get it done?  Well, it's odd.  For me, that's never really happened because I think the whole nature of what I do being an actor is kind of requires of you total commitment when you jump in there. 
[02:36:30]  Right.  And so by the time that the camera's rolling, I'm pretty much on board.  But aren't there times you just know, uh-oh, I got myself into something here?  No, maybe later on.  You know, if you see one, it's a stinker, you know?  Come on. Greased lightning?  It hurts.  That was a good one with Richard Pryor.  Richard Pryor, of course.  I was going to ask about that.  Did you get along with Pryor?  Because he legendarily gets along with no one.  You can dig a lot deeper into the craft than that one.  Yeah, that was Richard Pryor's first kind of main thing. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, it was like a real serious role for him as Wendell Scott.  Did you enjoy working with him or was he brutal?  No, he was wonderful in that movie.  Yeah, he was just great.  Okay, it was probably before he got jaded and miserable on coke.  I liked you as Warren Tucker in Sea Hunt episode Storm Train.  Don't you love Internet Movie Database?  No.  Actually, you were in an episode of Sea Hunt with your dad.  Yes, I played a jewel thief in that one. 
[02:37:30]  Really?  Who escapes into a storm drain after I pull off the heist,  and then Mike Nelson, my dad, dives into the sewer to save me.  Ah.  I used to watch that as a kid all the time, Sea Hunt.  Yeah, sure.  Hey, Bo.  Got a question for you, and I bet Anthony will recall this, too.  It seemed like every episode at some point in Sea Hunt involved somebody getting behind your dad and cutting his ear hose.  A violent underwater fight, his ear hose gets cut, right? 
[02:38:00]  That's right.  Yeah, what was the whole storyline to that?  What was your dad's character in that?  Well, he was like a, I think he was, was he an ex-coast guard guy or something?  That was just sort of.  But he would just.  He was like a detective, and he would go out and solve crimes on the water.  Underwater detective?  Like, how many underwater crimes are happening?  But in doing so.  Seems like a bad business.  He was all underwater, and he really introduced a lot of people across the country and the world to underwater stuff. 
[02:38:30]  And, you know, he and Jacques Cousteau kind of came along at the same time.  Yep.  Cousteau, of course, in the scientific area, my dad.  I had a sea, I had a sea hunt moment, Bo.  Oh, did you? What happened?  I was scuba diving, and I beat up a Frenchman 60 feet underwater once.  Did you pull out his arrow?  No, I just punched him a few times, and we were wrestling and stuff in slow motion underwater.  It's a true story.  The only way to wrestle underwater is slow motion.  I was scuba diving, and this Frenchman, who was just being a complete ass on the boat before we dove, 
[02:39:00]  wasn't paying attention to anything.  It was his first dive, and he just came down way too fast and landed on top of me.  So I decided the best way to take care of this was to punch him in his face underwater.  Geez, well, Jacques Cousteau wouldn't like that very much.  Cut his air hose open.  We had kind of a sea hunt, slow motion fight underwater.  It was great.  Excellent.  I wish I could have been there.  Now, you did Norma Ray in 79, and a great film, and Ron Liebman was in that.  What is Ron Liebman doing?  I haven't seen Ron in a long time. 
[02:39:30]  He's a good guy, and I actually worked again with him after that.  I cast him in a movie that I directed, and he was wonderful.  He's always great when he's out there.  Yeah, he did a very funny film by Mad Magazine called Up the Academy.  Oh, I didn't see that one.  I didn't see that one.  I remember that one, sure.  So are you looking for any young actors?  Because, I mean, I would definitely like to do some Hollywood acting work.  You know, I wouldn't mind considering you, but I'd like you to send me some footage of you 
[02:40:00]  where you could actually say something without looking into the camera.  That's very important to me.  See, Jimmy?  I don't think you have any of that.  No, but a lot of times I like to hold the paper, but I always make sure I'm holding a newspaper  so the audience doesn't see that I'm actually reading off the script.  I know how to hide it around the set.  And, Beau, Jim was in Spider-Man, the first one.  Oh, yeah, I had one line in Spider-Man.  That's true.  What did you say?  Well, I was the pivotal turning point in the film.  I was a man on the street, and they said, what do you think of Spider-Man? 
[02:40:30]  I said, he stinks, and I don't like him.  And I was, uh...  Got it, your line right here.  He stinks, and I don't like him.  That was my line.  That was the actual line from Spider-Man.  Is that how you said it?  Yeah, well, I was just kind of...  I was exasperated.  That was me playing exasperated.  So you had more...  On the actual take, you had more exasperation in there.  Yeah, I used a little bit of spunk.  I didn't even get to meet Sam Raimi.  It was all his second unit shoot in Queens.  Spunk, you know, spunk is really on the way out.  Yeah.  You've got to get rid of the spunk, too.  Yeah, here Peppy is making a comeback. 
[02:41:00]  And spunk is...  Peppy is better, yeah.  I like playing lackadaisical.  Ooh.  Sure.  Well, Bo, thank you for joining us.  All right.  Thank you, Bo.  Thank you, Mr. Bridges.  Good talking to you guys.  Have a great day.  You too.  Bo Bridges, everyone.  Bye-bye.  That's a big Hollywood star, that guy.  Right there.  Jeff, his brother.  In studio.  Right?  Lloyd.  Dad Lloyd.  Hey, this is Joe Perry, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[02:41:30]  I like my penis.  You just reminded me of something.  We didn't play the audio of Celine Dion on Larry King.  No, we didn't.  This was priceless.  She was very upset.  Let's...  We all understand that it was a disaster down there.  Mm-hmm.  But how could you not laugh when Celine Dion just breaks into song on Larry King?  Because that's going to help the victims.  That's what they need.  That's what they need.  A song from Celine.  Ew, she sang.  Oh, my God.  This is really creepy.  Ew.  It's deeply disturbing. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  I understand everyone.  Even we have been affected, and we're trying to do our part, but god damn, man.  Some of these people have got to relax.  Like Ben brought in the picture of Sean Penn walking around New Orleans with a shotgun.  A shotgun.  Here it is right here.  He's walking around with a shotgun, I guess, to protect himself as he goes on his rescue missions.  I don't know.  There's a lot of stories about the shotgun.  Supposedly, he found it laying around and picked it up.  Oh.  Others say that he brought it himself. 
[02:42:30]  I was handing this to the police.  Right.  Shithead, you got caught.  It's okay for you to have a gun for protection, but nobody else, right?  Yeah.  His little scheme backfired.  You know, this guy brought his own photographer down there as he's rescuing people.  That's just no good.  I thought he was an asshole for many years, but it turns out he really is kind of just a weirdo.  Like, he's one of those real weird guys.  Be more like your brother. 
[02:43:00]  He's fat and jolly and makes fun movies.  Hmm.  Looks like an alcoholic.  Yeah.  What a mess he is.  That's how I'm going to say that word from now on.  Alcoholic.  Alcoholic.  Maybe you'll get him on the show.  We have the same manager.  I'll talk to my manager.  Stop it.  And I have talked to Chris Penn in the past.  I've never met him.  Oh, we did.  We did.  Many years ago.  No, in person too.  Oh.  I got a picture with Chris Penn.  I want one.  I should bring in all my old celebrity photos.  They're kind of funny.  You should. 
[02:43:30]  Throw them up on the website there.  All right, here we go.  Celine Dion.  We've got to play this a little bit here.  Celine.  A little bit.  Celine Dion and Larry King last week.  I have to say, Larry, that I'm as devastated as the rest of the world.  Devastated?  If I may, I was watching you behind.  There's a television right now.  I'm watching and I'm especially waiting like the rest of the world.  I'm waking up in the morning.  I'm having a coffee.  I barely can swallow it.  Yeah, through your little pigeon neck.  She sounds like Christopher Walken. 
[02:44:00]  Oh.  I can barely swallow it.  Barely.  I can swallow it.  And she's in one of those ridiculous sweets in Las Vegas.  From my huge 38-inch plasma television, I could not take the pain and anguish of those  people as I looked down on Las Vegas from my penthouse suite.  Why couldn't you swallow the coffee?  Was her husband using her mouth to practice rolling Dyson?  Well, we've heard he's got a problem. 
[02:44:30]  What can I tell you?  We all have problems.  Yeah.  And I'm especially waiting like the rest of the world.  I'm waking up in the morning.  I'm having a coffee.  I barely can swallow it.  I come here at Caesars Palace every night to perform.  Uh-oh.  I barely can sing.  Yeah, well.  But for respect for the people who come, I am still singing.  When I come home at night, my son is waiting for me.  I watch television. 
[02:45:00]  Yes, we gave a million dollars.  But what we expect, what I want to look like the rest of the world.  I open the television.  There's people...  How do you open a television?  I open the television.  Opie, I don't think we should make fun of this.  She's still sang while those people suffered.  She's brave.  She is brave.  She's a brave girl.  We gave a million dollars.  I have a coffee.  We...  I don't know what plural is.  Yeah.  What about buying an S, you foreign whore? 
[02:45:30]  Watch television?  Yes, we gave a million dollars.  But what we expect, what I want to look like the rest of the world, I open the television.  See, it was a dollar and she just wrote million on it.  Million dollar?  It was a million dollar.  And I open the television and I see wires and tubes.  And I don't know what year it is because there's never tubes in TVs anymore, you idiot.  I open television? 
[02:46:00]  What?  But what we expect, what I want to look like the rest of the world, I open the television.  There's people still there waiting to be rescued.  And for me, it's not acceptable.  I know there's reasons for it.  I'm sorry to say I'm being rude, but I don't want to hear those reasons.  Ooh.  You know, some people...  They should fly her over, fly her over like the flooded areas.  Yeah.  In a helicopter and lower her down and then she could sing the Titanic song.  Wouldn't that be great? 
[02:46:30]  As they're hanging on to their roofs?  Hold on, Tyrone.  Tyrone, don't let go.  Don't ever let go, Tyrone.  If only there was room enough for you on that door that your girlfriend is on right now.  It could be a huge cavernous door and there still wouldn't be room.  Have you seen the women down there?  Big fat asses.  You are survivor.  Many people perished under the brown sewage of New Orleans. 
[02:47:00]  Much like they did that fateful night in April of 19...  18?  12?  14?  1912.  It was 12.  Shut up.  Much like they perished in the icy waters of the North Atlantic.  On that fateful maiden voyage of the Titanic.  But some of them were survivors. 
[02:47:30]  Where are you?  And Larry, I watch.  I watch and personally I don't care.  But I cry.  I cry because my husband is 90 fucking years old.  I cry when I think he touched me when I was 14. 
[02:48:00]  And forced me to marry him.  That is why I weep today.  You think I really care about the shwoogies, Larry?  How many bodies lie there beneath that mucky brown stinky mess?  I say P-U, Larry.  And some of them cling to their rooftops like many clung to life jackets and pieces of wood 
[02:48:30]  on that fateful night on the Titanic.  They are truly, truly Negroes.  They are so poor and so black.  All right, back to the audio.  Jesus.  Oh, fantastic.  Oh, stop it. 
[02:49:00]  Back to Celine.  More crying Celine.  And for me, it's not acceptable.  I know there's reasons for it.  I'm sorry to say I'm being rude.  But I don't want to hear those reasons.  You know, some people are stealing and they're making a big deal out of it.  Oh, they're stealing 20 pair of jeans or they're stealing television sets.  Who cares?  They're not going to go too far with it.  Maybe those people are so poor.  Some of the people who do that, they're so poor, they've never touched anything in their  lives.  Let them touch those things for once.  Invite them into your house. 
[02:49:30]  Let them touch.  You also have never touched a seat at your show at Caesars, you fucking overpriced Canadian  hosebag.  But you never touched an orchestra seat there, did they?  Oh, my God.  Let them touch stuff.  Let them just touch it.  That's the biggest cocktease ever.  Here, feel this plasma TV that you'll never have.  How racist she is.  Holy shit.  Just touch it.  Just touch it, because that'll make you feel better.  Unfortunately, they were touching guns at Walmarts and touching the triggers. 
[02:50:00]  Stop it.  I was inspired when they taught Coco to sign.  Oh, she did not say, let the people touch.  Just touch it.  Just touch it.  Oh, my goodness.  The people who do that, they're so poor.  They've never touched anything in their lives.  Let them touch those things for once.  The main thing right now, it's not the people who are stealing.  It's the people who are left there and they're watching helicopters flying over their heads. 
[02:50:30]  And they're praying.  How come it's so easy to send planes in another country to kill everyone in a second to destroy lives?  We need to serve our country.  And for me to serve our country is to be there right now to rescue the rest of the people.  We need the cash.  We need the blood.  We need the support.  Right now, we need the prayers.  Jesus, where's Larry through that hole? 
[02:51:00]  Jesus, I was nodding off.  She has the foreign policy inside of a six-year-old.  Why do we send bombs to blub their world and the universe?  In seconds.  In seconds.  Everything.  I can't get over the fact, let them touch things.  Just touch it.  Much like the poor passengers that were stuck in steerage on the Titanic.  We should just pull gates shut and lock them to drown in their basements.  Look, Tyrone, you'll never have an iPod, but hey, feel free to touch it. 
[02:51:30]  I want to touch it.  Right.  Oh.  Oh, is that the best?  What a mess she is.  She continued on Larry King last week.  It is, you know, when I was hearing a couple of days ago that these things are not reachable.  It's too full of water.  Maybe I'm too much like a mic.  I'm not thinking with my head.  I'm talking with my heart.  Nobody can open any roofs.  The helicopters flying in.  Take two people at a time. 
[02:52:00]  Take a kayak.  Go into those walls.  Take a kayak?  A kayak.  Oh, she's an outdoorsy one.  Or take a limo like I do to go to my shows.  Why can't they take the flying Steve car and please pick up these people?  Take a kayak.  Oh, it is so easy if Steve would just, there he is now.  Just fly by Steve.  Land and pick these people up in your flying hybrid car. 
[02:52:30]  The helicopters flying in.  Take two people at a time.  Take a kayak.  Go into those walls.  What?  There's kids being ready.  You can't take a kayak through walls.  Take a kayak through those walls?  What does she say?  She watches Gilligan's Island too much.  Do you think that's how they get around?  A kayak?  Jesus, this isn't I Dream of Jeannie.  Is Jim leaving a permanent thing? 
[02:53:00]  No.  Stop it.  Stop it.  He's still a big part of the show and he'll be coming back and forth and doing this and  doing that.  Don't you worry.  There's kids being raped at night.  We hear gunshots.  Big guns.  What's that?  Those people are playing.  They're walking.  They're like this.  Hello?  Do you see us?  We're still alive.  But we're dying.  It's terrible.  I do not want to talk to you about money. 
[02:53:30]  What?  Holy crap.  Will you just shut up and sing your stupid song?  She lost her fucking mind and it's fantastic.  We can't see them at night because they're dark until they smile.  We see teeth.  We think they're floating dentures.  But there are people attached to those.  Oh, is she an ass?  I thought somebody dropped a big package of ping pong balls and I was looking.  But it was humans looking up at me.  I thought it was ping pong balls and chiclets. 
[02:54:00]  But it wasn't, Larry.  It was people.  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow.  Let's say hi to Carl in New Jersey.  Carl?  Hey, she sounds like Mr. Wett.  Do you remember Mr. Wett?  Mr. Wett.  Yeah, there was two radio DJs.  They had a show back in the day.  I forget their names.  You and Anthony referenced them all the time once in a while back in the day. 
[02:54:30]  I've never heard of him.  Mr. Wett, I'm from the sewer.  I live under the ground.  I am Mr. Wett.  Never, ever, ever.  This guy is amazing.  Man, I could have saved...  I'm sorry, Carl.  I really don't know what you're talking about.  All right, let's continue with...  Why are you taking the birthday cake out?  Huh?  Oh, okay.  All right, more of Celine Dion.  Of course, please.  I want this burnt so I could listen to it on the way home. 
[02:55:00]  Of course.  We're going to have Maury Povich in studio in a few minutes as well, so stay there.  Maury.  But first, more Celine Dion.  This is too good.  Maury's going to have to wait a few minutes.  We've been doing the show now for two and a half hours.  We've been asking a lot of people how they can help, how you can help.  A lot of people all over the world want to help.  You gave a million dollars.  You're going to help a lot of people live and survive.  You should take great pride in that.  One, that you've attained the ability to be able to do that.  To be able to give a million dollars. 
[02:55:30]  You should take pride in that.  I understand it.  I understand it's very important because eventually we will need that money.  But it's just very frustrating that Franco and Consciousness and me,  oh, we have one million dollars.  If this is one thing, in three months, in six months, they will need that money.  Right now, they're praying for water.  So we need to send them the water.  They don't care about my check.  No, they do.  It's just frustrating because on our part of the world, we're trying our death  and we're expecting those people. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, she don't shut up.  I'm sorry.  Your check will turn into something.  And I'm sending Welch's grape juice and garlic.  Old, doddering old buffoon.  Yeah, you know, I love Larry King's style where he pretty much doesn't do anything on his show  and lets the people talk.  But sometimes, as a host, you've got to jump in there a little bit.  My God, is she upset?  Shut up.  All right, here is the clip of clips.  I know you've got to go on soon, but we couldn't spend any time with you without asking you. 
[02:56:30]  Do you have any kind of thing you would like to sing that fits this moment?  She's got a song for everything.  Thanks, Larry.  She's got a song for everything.  She's got a song for everything.  Is there any song in New York?  Even if you did a little of it, I don't want to.  Well, the only song that comes to my mind right now is definitely a prayer. 
[02:57:00]  What's going on in Larry King's mind?  Do you think he knows she's just a lunatic at this point and is exploiting that?  Yeah.  Or is he dead serious about having Celine Dion sing a song for everybody?  I think he's just trying to get as much out of her as he can.  And at this point, having her do a song is the icing.  Do you think so?  Is he being that calculating or is he just an out of touch ass?  That's what I'm wondering, you know.  Sing a song.  The Motley Crue.  Because she's not in the right frame of mind to actually sing a song. 
[02:57:30]  Well, let's see how this plays out.  Sing a prayer?  It's definitely a prayer.  I did sing that song a few years back with Andrea Bocelli.  Oh, yes.  And I cannot think about a song without a prayer.  I will do my very best and I'll do my best.  General Scatter and Darmasis.  I pray you'll be alright. 
[02:58:00]  And watch us where we go.  Let's just end.  Bruce Kelly's crying.  And help us to be wise.  In times when we don't know.  Let this be our prayer.  When we lose our way.  Lead us to a place. 
[02:58:30]  Guide us with your grace.  Liar, whore.  Liar, whore.  And you know it.  To a place where we'll be safe.  Shut your goddamn pie hole.  I pray we'll find your life.  You can get a doggy style.  You can get Ling on your side.  Those are your only choices.  This is my house and I get to sing.  When stars go out each night.  Reminds us where you are. 
[02:59:00]  Let this be our prayer.  Panty talk.  Panty talk.  More.  For our days.  Help us find a place.  Guide us with your grace.  Now choke yourself.  Give us faith so we'll be safe. 
[02:59:30]  Well, no shit.  That's it.  Come on.  Okay, terrific.  There you have it.  That's very dramatic.  Wow.  Celine Dion and Larry King last week.  Wow.  Liar, whore, liar, whore.  There you go.  Wow, she lost her mind.  That's fantastic.  Bob Kelly sucks in with lies.  What's up?  This is Robert Kelly.  Listen, if you want to find out where I'm performing, go to my website, robertkellylive.com 
[03:00:00]  and email me.  Or go to my MyFace and be my friend.  I stink!  Dumb juvenile delinquent asshole how to smoke fucking weed.  For more information, go to robertkellylive.com.  I'm so fucking dumb.  I want to fucking be an intelligent 34-year-old man and be able to read off a dump in bold  fucking 75-point Helvetica text.  The fucking thing you want me to read.  All I have to do is add my name where it's blank.  That's what I want to do. 
[03:00:30]  The worst of O.E. and Anthony.  I know.  The big oil companies have really...  There's so many other alternative ways to do this that they're just not being...  I think so, yeah.  I don't think there are.  I think so.  At the point we're at in history right here, maybe in the future, someday we'll have matter,  anti-matter generators like in Star Trek.  But right now, it's all about the Earl.  I'm all for the windmills.  Windmills, huh?  I want more windmill fields. 
[03:01:00]  More than bird killers.  Covering the entire country in windmills might work.  I think there are alternative things that are...  You look at the electric cars and stuff like that, you can see that the technology is really...  I mean, they're getting like a lot...  Steve's got a hybrid.  Steve drives a hybrid, which is just creepy on some level.  My hybrid.  It runs on water and honey and bee energy.  I scoop them out and I put them in the gas tank.  And as they try to leave, my car goes...  Generate the energy. 
[03:01:30]  Stupid.  Fucking trying to keep his own little outdoor place.  Bee power.  There you go.  Yeah, that's all well and fine.  You know, the hybrids.  But he still pulls up to a gas pump.  Yeah.  He still uses petrol.  I just think they're...  Like, what are you...  You're a...  You're a Malata...  Mangro class of vehicle.  Steve's got the hybrid.  What's wrong with the hybrid?  Nothing.  I was actually defending it.  How much does it cost to fill up?  Now it's about $20.50.  $20.50 to fill up your tank.  Right there. 
[03:02:00]  How many miles did you go?  400 miles on that.  400 miles.  I just filled up my Escalade yesterday.  Are you over $50?  I am so over $50.  I went over $50 for the first time.  My tank is smaller than yours.  I'm like, what?  $50 to fill it up from empty?  $65.  And on that, I can go 350 miles.  Yeah.  I mean, it's not...  Truckers are laughing at us right now, by the way.  But you know what I think?  I don't care about gas prices.  Why?  Because we're rich.  Speak for yourself. 
[03:02:30]  Really?  You know what?  I don't think about gas.  I only fill up like once every 10 days living in the city.  I do the cellar and back every night.  I don't do any driving.  Yeah, you really don't drive that much.  It's amazing.  So it's like, I mean, whatever it is, I don't notice because I've never used gas.  I can go for a week or so, a week and a half on a full tank if I'm just driving in and driving back home.  But you're up to $65.  $65 to fill the gas tank up in that monster.  It hit $50 for the first time for me, and I was like, what?  I'm noticing I'm getting a little lonely out there in the huge SUV club.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:03:00]  You certainly are.  You look around now, and remember a couple of years back, you could not, you drive down any highway, it was SUV after SUV.  Now, not seeing as many.  I'm kind of alone out there.  You can't have an SUV unless there's a TV in the back of the seat and you have gold teeth.  That's who drives SUVs, pimps and dope dealers and radio hosts who can't wait to get home and get away from the germs.  Jimmy's on fire.  That's it.  I got away from the germs.  Of course.  I'm sorry, Steve.  So your hybrid, which actually gave us a nice ride to OzFest. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  You want to go early, so I miss Sabbath.  How was the acceleration, Jim?  The pickup is not that bad.  It's a quick little car.  It doesn't go really fast.  I've had it up to about 95 miles an hour.  Yeah.  And at that speed, it gets about 12 miles to the gallon.  Maybe around 11 and a half miles to the gallon.  But at most...  Wait, wait, wait.  12 miles a gallon?  That's a hunk of shit.  I thought it was like 80 miles a gallon.  No, no, no, no.  At that speed...  Well, he was going 95 miles an hour.  At 95 miles an hour, you put pinned to the floor fast.  How would my Saturn, and I'm not trying to name drop, but how much would my Saturn get 
[03:04:00]  to a gallon?  I don't know.  90 miles an hour?  A rough guess.  Probably not that good either.  No.  Okay, okay.  When I'm coasting around the city, this thing gets around 60 miles to the gallon.  I mean, when you look at the energy meter, it says it's getting 100 miles to the gallon.  You have an energy meter?  The whole front of the thing.  You've got to get in this car.  My energy meter.  Half those meters are bullshit.  They're just there spinning and lighting up for no real reason.  Well, it tells you when the engine is shut off, basically. 
[03:04:30]  When the gasoline engine has shut down, and you're running on battery power.  When you're running on battery power.  Because as it's moving and as you're braking, it's charging the hybrid...  Thank you, Jimmy.  I speak with my hand.  When Steve talks, I'll just interrupt you.  You see Steve is moving his left arm.  It looks like he's holding a softball that doesn't exist.  That's how his hand is clenched.  Like a Roman emperor, he's presenting something to the people.  Presenting.  And it's just well-spoken dreck.  Or shit. 
[03:05:00]  Or shit.  Where are your batteries stored?  In the tribrit.  In the trunk.  Well, not in the trunk.  It's in that area, I guess.  Below the trunk.  Yeah, below the trunk.  Where a gas tank would be.  Yeah.  I mean, half of it is maybe a 10 or 11-gallon gas tank.  Any problems?  Say you run out of gas, how far can you go on your battery?  I've had it down to zero once, and I went about maybe 20 miles, I think.  And you're on no gas?  On no gas.  I mean, but you have to drive pretty slow.  You've got to drive about 30 miles an hour when you do that.  Why did you run out of gas?  Because I wasn't paying attention. 
[03:05:30]  What could you...  With all those gauges and meters, I got confused.  It was brand new.  It was brand new, and I thought, ah, shit, let's see what this thing can do.  And I was on.  I know what happened.  What happened?  You went to get gas, and when you got out, they thought you were threatening.  They didn't realize you were just standing up to look around.  I seem to have run out of petrol.  Tigger, could you pump some gas into this, please?  Or something that sounds like that to the attendant.  Wow. 
[03:06:00]  But you're right.  You don't see that many SUVs on the road.  You just don't.  No.  You won't.  And what about those people that have to drive in from, you know, western New Jersey  or Eastern Long Island?  Exactly.  Commute from Maine.  But that's the way to go, man.  He's got, he's getting like 60 miles to a gallon or 40 miles, 50 miles to a gallon.  My point was that, like, there are ways to do it.  To cut down.  A lot.  A lot.  They could do it full electric if they wanted to.  They could, come on.  They absolutely could.  I mean...  But don't we live in a country where if we want to drive an apartment building on wheels, 
[03:06:30]  we should be able to?  If you can afford it, absolutely.  I mean, why not?  This is America.  And if we want to drive these huge gas-sucking SUVs, we should be able to.  We shouldn't even have to worry about it.  We shouldn't have to be rich and fancy.  We should be able to just be the average Joe that goes to work and earns a good wage every day.  He should still be able to buy that big vehicle because we're Americans. 
[03:07:00]  We shouldn't have to be like a big, cuddly bear and buy a roller skate with a D-cell battery in it to get to work.  You...  A hybrid?  What?  It says pussy car.  It's a pussy mobile.  It certainly does not.  There is nothing sexy, nothing strong, nothing...  People's heads aren't going to turn.  And how come there's year-long waiting lists for these things?  Are there that many pussies that want hybrids? 
[03:07:30]  Yes.  The only one company is dumb enough to make them.  Right.  It's a hybrid.  It's part vehicle, part carnivore.  I'm spending a lot less on gas.  Yeah, I got my hybrid.  It's a chick magnet.  Well, look, dude.  Lexus is making a hybrid Lexus SUV that's coming out.  Actually, I think it's out right now.  Really?  The Islander is an SUV.  Hummer's making a hybrid, which I don't understand because it's going to be 14 miles to a gallon. 
[03:08:00]  What make is yours?  Toyota.  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Speaking of hybrids, did they take that magazine because I want a picture hung up.  It's a hybrid, all right.  I like Steve for doing that, though.  I respect the fact that he's saving some money.  Let's say hi to Tim in St. Louis.  Tim, what's going on, buddy?  What's going on, I hope?  Hey, man.  Tim.  Tim, you're on.  Go ahead, Tim.  Yeah, that's nothing.  I just wanted to say it took like I filled up my tank yesterday on my big truck, and it was like almost $700. 
[03:08:30]  $700.  $700.  What do you drive, like a tanker truck?  Do you have to fill the actual rig, the back?  No, it's a 2001 Freightliner.  It's got 150-gallon tanks on each side.  Wow.  Oh, 300 gallons.  $700.  How many miles do you go on that?  I'm on my way to Spartanburg, South Carolina right now from St. Louis.  I mean, how many miles can you go on a full tank?  About 1,200. 
[03:09:00]  1,200?  That's it?  That's a lot of miles, man.  For $700?  Pretty good.  1,200.  How much a gallon, sir?  I don't feel like doing the math.  I was in Nevada about two weeks ago, and I paid $2.79 a gallon.  That's high.  They're saying in Jersey it's up to $3 in some places already.  All right, Tim, thank you.  Well, we're going to get a lot of these calls.  John in Oklahoma, $640 to fill up his tank, right, John?  Yeah.  What are you driving, a Honda?  No. 
[03:09:30]  No, Freightliner.  All right.  Well, obviously, it's out of control of the fuel cost.  Tell B-Power Steve that all the money he's saving on gas will be spent replacing that $500 battery in about three years.  Also, that big old acid-filled battery causes more damage to the environment than gas.  No, it doesn't.  No, it doesn't.  You don't have a...  It's not vented, right?  Not vented batteries.  The old-style batteries used to leak.  Yeah.  It's totally self-contained, and there's so many tons of them.  Have they told you about battery life and how long those things are supposed to last? 
[03:10:00]  Sure, I'm sure it's in the documentation somewhere.  It ain't just like going to Sears and buying one of those batteries and popping it under your hood.  Well, no, that's the thing.  It does regenerate power.  It doesn't, you know, the combustion engine powers the fuel cell while you're driving.  So, as far as how long that lasts, I don't know.  I can look it up, though.  Yeah.  And the guy who just wrote that, he's like one of those guys, he was just saying, he just says shit.  Bloom and doom guy.  Dude, that acid causes more problems than gas.  And people go, really?  Yeah.  He's the guy that, when he's talking about counterfeiting money, he's like, dude, the government's the one who's counterfeiting it.  Yeah. 
[03:10:30]  Where's your facts?  None.  Dude, they are.  Don't have one.  There's a website.  Let's say hi to Carl in Texas.  Carl, what do you got for the program?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Carl.  Hi, Carl.  Yeah.  Yeah, when I was in college, we actually built a couple of hybrids for the Department of Energy.  One that was gas electric, like what she's got, and one that's a hydrogen, full hybrid.  And, you know, to be honest, yeah, those gas electrics are great, but, you know, the mileage on them is still a problem.  You're still using gas.  It's a start, but the reality is the way it looks like it's going, and BMW's already produced one, and Honda's already made one, and GM's making them. 
[03:11:00]  It's these hydrogen-powered vehicles.  He's right.  He's right, but you have to put hydrogen refueling stations on the highways, and it's going to be a while.  The hybrid car is a nice transition piece.  Yeah, well, that's the main problem.  Yeah, where do you find one of those?  There was a good hydrogen-powered mode of transportation a few years ago.  It was called the Hindenburg.  That thing worked out well.  Oh, my God, the humanity.  Oh, gee.  Oh, get out of the way. 
[03:11:30]  The SUV, the purpose of the vehicle was to actually produce it, to make it exactly like a 2000 Suburban, and it had the same functionality, same acceleration, same haul, everything.  So you didn't lose anything.  So to the driver, it was exactly the same vehicle.  It was just you fill up at a different place.  That's all.  All right.  Thank you, Carl.  Yeah.  Take care.  Chuck from Pittsburgh saying, sorry, the increase in my weekly gas cost from $1.60 a gallon to $2.60 a gallon is about $22.  The cost of walking away from an accident, priceless. 
[03:12:00]  There you go.  I like some steel around me, my friend.  How about that?  What happens when your car gets rear-ended, and you get battery acid all over?  Well, that is the one drawback.  Yeah, that is a drawback.  The whole fucking car is a crumple zone.  It's a huge, like, of just tinfoil and battery acid is what you drive around in.  Yeah, it's a very light car, hopefully.  And if you read about hybrids, you realize that the progression would be to build these things out of lighter, stronger metals. 
[03:12:30]  Of course.  So that, you know, you could build a smaller car that wouldn't weigh so much.  Composites.  Exactly.  Space-age polymers.  Exactly, but that's where it's going.  It's you.  Oh, there goes Steve.  Steve is driving around in the studio, and it is a hybrid.  Here comes Steve to work.  Steve!  Steve!  Steve!  Steve!  Steve!  Steve!  Steve!  Steve!  Steve!  Steve!  Steve!  Steve!  Steve!  Steve!  Cool!  Look out!  Look!  Here he comes!  Oh, Steve!  He's showing off now!  Jesus!  There's a bear driving the hybrid! 
[03:13:00]  Clumsy claws are trying to hit the buttons and fumbling.  Steve!  Careful!  Oh.  It doesn't make sense that you're the one with the hybrid.  You should be driving the Hummer.  Oh, you need the big vehicle.  I used to have an SUV.  You must be hysterical squeezing into that thing.  No, it's surprisingly roomy on the inside.  It's open inside.  There's actually a lot of room on the inside.  It's a weird angle, though.  What do you mean, angle?  I can't even explain it.  Like, the windshield, and it goes up like this. 
[03:13:30]  Does he have one of those huge dashboards?  Yeah.  Like, because the windshield has to be at such an extreme angle to cut down on wind resistance?  Yeah, it's a weird, weird angle.  Oh, God, stop it.  So you're looking out the front, you know, through the windshield, but because of the angle, it's just a strange view.  Yeah, the windshield is huge.  It's shaped like a big wedge to cut down on the wind resistance.  It's like a big cheese wedge shape.  Oh, my goodness.  It's really strange.  You can't put anything on your dashboard, because it starts off really, really, you know, tiny and it gets bigger. 
[03:14:00]  All right, hop in it again, Steve.  Take another laugh around.  Hey, man!  Hey, man!  Hey, man!  Hang it.  It's a hybrid.  See him on the side of the highway, broken down with an electrical cord, looking for a place to plug it in?  You don't have to plug it in, though, Jim.  Of course you don't.  All right, let's say hi to Gonzo in Long Island.  Gonzo!  Yeah?  What's up, Gonzo?  Not much, man.  How you guys doing?  All right.  Go ahead, Gonzo.  Oh, all right.  Listen, on defense of Steve, man, I got a hybrid. 
[03:14:30]  I got a Toyota Highlander, and that's in boogies, man.  It puts 260 horsepower.  You can fly on the highway.  Oh, yeah?  It's a Highlander, you know?  It does good.  Highlander.  I just took a trip up to the Catskills and on the gas tank.  It was what?  I got almost 28 miles per gallon on an SUV.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Thank you, sir.  Hey.  See ya.  Bye.  It's the worst. 
[03:15:00]  Hey, you really need to jump in.  I don't know, man, Anthony.  He's allowed to walk out and take phone calls.  Because he's fancy and special.  He can leave the show whenever he darn well pleases.  Hey, look at that.  It's gaffing in.  He just abandons his post like a coward.  It amazes me that the radio show is truly secondary to Jim Norton's life.  He doesn't really care.  I would love to get up right now and just make a phone call.  Just leave. 
[03:15:30]  Just leave.  He didn't even say anything.  No.  Like he just gets up and leaves.  Sometimes he just leaves to check email.  Where did he go?  You can't just leave your post.  He'd be great in the Army, wouldn't he?  Who's holding off the front?  Jimmy Norton.  Where did he go?  Ah, he had his pig a leak.  What?  It's about his couch that he's getting delivered.  And he wanted...  We were going to send one of the interns to his house today to wait.  Because he was only going to get delivered during the show. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  So we were going to have one of the interns go over.  Because he wants it in a certain spot and everything.  But that fell through.  So now he's out there.  He's like, I confirmed this.  And he's going...  It'd be funny if he was in here doing it on there.  Please don't tell me that he's going to leave today's program so he can get a couch for  his couch.  When it's delivered, you move it.  If it's not exactly where you're going to go.  Oh, no.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Uh-oh.  Hi, Jimmy.  It's fucking never easy, man.  It's never easy in life.  What happened?  My sofa's being delivered today.  Two months ago, I ordered it. 
[03:16:30]  Ben is so happy right now.  But it's amazing how nothing gets done in fucking life.  Nothing gets done correctly.  What was supposed to happen?  Originally, they called me for a scheduled delivery.  I say, look, I'm on the air until 11 a.m.  I have an acting class tonight at 6.  Oh, really?  So, yeah, you know, you might as well start a month before you go to L.A.  So, can you come after 11, between 11 and 6? 
[03:17:00]  We can't guarantee that, but we'll try.  I get a call.  You're scheduled between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m.  That's not within the parameters.  Can't do it, and that's why we were going to have Clayton or one of these guys wait at  my apartment for the delivery people if I couldn't reschedule.  So, I call them back.  The lady was very nice, Maria, for room and board, a place in Soho that my gay friend  took me to.  And I, I know, I know.  Very good.  And, uh...  Oh, no.  What happened now? 
[03:17:30]  He's trying to tell a story.  Go ahead, Jim.  And I'm so bored with the story in general, I picked up my blackjack and I'm starting to  read email.  I'm enjoying Jimmy's story because it just shows that there's garbage working out there.  Now, what, what was the problem now?  Um, well, I, I, I was, I just, you know...  Oh, this cake is delicious, Jimmy. 
[03:18:00]  Is it?  Have a piece.  Here we go.  Here's the cake.  It's a fork full of smile.  Fucking mind-boggling.  Mind-boggling.  Are there savages involved?  What happened, Jimmy?  I want to know what happened, though.  All right, the intern's supposed to be over to accept delivery.  Where's this problem now?  Uh, with the, it was with the, uh... 
[03:18:30]  He is so fucking distracted.  He is ready to either kill himself or kill somebody else.  I'm just not hungry anymore.  I'm just annoyed.  Not that you put something down, that happens, but, you know...  So now why can't the intern be there and the couch gets on?  Oh, because I called back and, uh, rescheduled it for noon to three.  The lady was very nice. 
[03:19:00]  And she's like, yeah, yeah, that's what I understand.  We'll make it, like, one of the later stops.  Mm-hmm.  So I just get a call from security in my building.  Oh, no.  Uh, do you have a furniture delivery?  And it's just like, they're there.  At a quarter to, uh, nine.  Yeah.  So I call the guy.  I say, can you put the guy on the phone, please?  And I tell him, look, you're not supposed to be here until after I spoke to Maria.  And you're not supposed to be there.  It's supposed to be noon to three.  He goes, oh, we had you first.  And I know it's probably going to get fixed, but it's just aggravating. 
[03:19:30]  You can never in life just make a phone call and have things taken care of.  Does anybody, just, does anything ever work smoothly?  No.  You know what happens when I'm scheduled to go on at 9.40 at the cellar?  I fucking get there and I go on at 9.40.  Give the people what they want.  Yes.  A fucking self-indulgent 20-minute horse shit set.  Oh.  As tired as I am, I know I walk in at 5 to 7.  We got to be on the air from 7 to 11.  I don't walk in at 8.30. 
[03:20:00]  I don't get here at 5 in the morning.  For some reason, people can't get shit right these days.  There is nothing that, when you order something or you need something done, you just expect it to go awry.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  Oh, it's just irritating.  Because I didn't want to stay home and miss the show today.  Obviously, I can't.  And I would have had the intern stay there and, you know, make sure the floors are okay.  You don't just have them come up and...  And now I'm thinking I should have just let them go up and put it there because now they're not going to come back. 
[03:20:30]  Big scratches on your nice wood floor.  Yeah, I got to wait until they come back.  Yes.  Well, we have to reschedule.  Do you really?  For when?  God, I hate dealing with...  I fucking hate dealing with people.  Is it a fancy couch?  It sure is.  Big and cushy for a boy to enjoy TV on.  Nice.  Will it sponge off easy?  No, I didn't even get the extra...  They were going to put some...  Scotchgard?  No.  Oh, Jimmy, what about the jism?  Please, who cares?  I'll just have it cleaned off.  I'll have somebody with a hyphen in their last name just come and clean it. 
[03:21:00]  Come on, lady.  Exactly.  Just clean it.  Let's go to Paul in Jersey.  Paul, go ahead.  Jimmy gets his couch on time.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  There you go.  Jimmy gets his couch on time.  But everybody has to deal with this crap when you got to go...  You got to go to...  You know, you have to stay home from work and do something.  There's times where you can't, so you go through the trouble of rescheduling it, and they confirm it.  And it's just...  Is there any reason shit has to be scheduled in an 8 to 10 hour window? 
[03:21:30]  No.  For a fucking couch?  No.  For a couch?  As soon as we go on break, I'm going to call the lady and just make sure all is well.  You mean to tell me they can't look at what they got to put on a truck?  Look at a map and see about how long something...  And narrow it down to even two hours.  Two fucking hours.  Ten hours.  They want you to wait.  Unbelievable.  Someone has a good point for you here, Jimmy. 
[03:22:00]  Tommy in Brooklyn.  Tommy?  Yeah.  What's up?  Listen, Jimmy.  Do you understand that every time they make a delivery, they're going to have to take your couch out,  put it on the street, pull out their delivery, then throw your couch back in?  Dude, I...  Oh my God, shut up.  Dude, shut up.  You have a little experience in this, right, Tommy?  You better tell Jimmy what's going to happen to his couch, his really nice, cushy couch.  It's time to order.  I've got to call the shopping cart.  It's over. 
[03:22:30]  I'm out.  Just a couple of goddamn apes throwing your couch off the back of the truck.  I fucking hate everybody.  I hate dealing with people.  Of course, the fucking phone's busy.  You're right.  It's a good point, though.  Oh my God.  But what am I supposed to do?  Can you have them...  You can't just tell them to go up there and leave it, because if they have to move something,  if there's something in the way, they're just going to scrape it across the floor.  Well, you know what?  Of course they will. 
[03:23:00]  Of course they will.  They'll scrape your floor up.  That has to be carried the entire way and placed down lightly, perhaps on little plastic  caster things.  I know that guy makes a great point.  I know that's what's going to happen.  It's going to get all chipped up and fucked up.  You know, your legs are going to be all wobbly now.  The legs on the couch.  Because you know they're going to kind of toss it sort of to the side.  Just not a big toss, but just enough, like a half a foot. 
[03:23:30]  But what will happen is you're going to get little street pebbles in the bottom of the  feet, and then when you put it down on your wood floor, it's going to make, like, just  these scratches all over the floor.  Yeah, that could be a real problem, I'm thinking, Ant.  Baboons just throwing cushions around, hitting each other with the cushions.  And it's not like homeless people are not puking and peeing and crapping on the sidewalks  where they're going to place the couch.  Oh, this couch looks comfortable.  I might just have to take a nap while you make that delivery. 
[03:24:00]  Oh.  Big urine stain on the middle cushion.  Well, if they don't put it there, someone will.  Well, let's go to Steve in Massachusetts.  Steve?  Fucking phone's busy.  Hey, Steve.  I'm going to the phones to try to help you out, Jimmy.  Steve?  Steve?  Steve, Massachusetts.  Got fucked by a furnace of delivery.  You, go.  Hello? 
[03:24:30]  What's your name?  Yeah, it's Steve from Massachusetts.  Oh, you asshole.  No, Jimmy, I wanted to tell you that.  You're up, you're all I got.  Wait, Jimmy, take the call on the air.  Hold on, hold on.  We've got to listen to this.  No, I can't leave her a message.  Oh, he is pissed.  He is so angry.  He is so pissed.  Let's go to John on Long Island.  John?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  I got fucking locked up because of our furniture delivery. 
[03:25:00]  What happened?  Supposed to be there at 8?  I'm there at 8.  Okay, take off.  You're going to work late.  No show.  All right, I went into work.  They tell me, okay, I call them on the way there.  They'll be there definitely at 12.  12 o'clock.  I go there.  They show at like 11.  And just drive away and leave a note on the door.  I go back.  At 3 now, they tell me.  Definitely 3, but I go there.  No show.  I go down to the furniture store, figure there, take it, put it in my pickup truck for me. 
[03:25:30]  I'll take it home myself, have my son help me.  The guy gets shitty behind the counter with me.  I drag him over the counter and beat the snot out of him.  Yeah.  What's the jail I go?  I think that's what Jimmy is ready to do.  Yeah, he's pacing outside the studio now.  Now we can't even do a show until we get to the bottom of his couch.  I can barely hear you guys.  Bill from Waterford is saying, I hope the couch company has Karma Chameleon on their hold line.  And Devin reminds me of the Brian Regan bit about the phone company. 
[03:26:00]  Can't you just flip a switch?  Yeah, we're going to flip that switch next Tuesday.  When you want your phone turned on?  Yeah, you want it turned on.  It's just like flipping a switch.  He nailed that, too.  It's like, well, we could turn your phone on next week, but...  Isn't it just flipping a switch?  Yeah, we're going to flip that switch next Tuesday.  That is really good.  Flip it now.  Wow, Eric is putting his life in danger. 
[03:26:30]  Oh, he totally is.  He's got a wireless mic right now.  He's completely insane.  By the way, the wireless mic, I don't hear it at all.  Jimmy's going to kill him.  Is it on?  I hear it.  I hear it.  Yeah, it's on.  He's waiting.  But Jimmy's on hold.  Poor guy.  There's no reason.  No reason.  He should be in a tizzy.  He rescheduled.  Afternoon.  Why?  Every...  I know it's going to happen.  They're going to take...  That guy was... 
[03:27:00]  Uh-oh.  Yes.  All right, here we go.  Jimmy's outside the studio.  We have a mic, sort of.  Yes.  I know, but the problem is this.  This is my concern.  Every single stop they make, that couch is going to have to come off and then go back on.  That collar got rattled.  They load it the way that they know they're going to have to deliver it.  So now I know that something's going to happen to it.  It's going to be...  And wait another, you know, six years. 
[03:27:30]  I've been working for this for two months.  I'm going to Los Angeles.  And this is going to be a big problem.  They loaded it wrong.  It's not...  I know what's going to happen.  I love that the collar got to him.  That one collar really did.  I saw his eyes.  We're picturing the couch going on and off.  The big monkeys just heaving it.  Because it's not their couch.  No.  I mean, we've all helped our friends move. 
[03:28:00]  Awful.  It's not my shit.  You always lean the couch up on those two little legs.  Much more weight than it's supposed to have.  When you're moving your own stuff, you're very careful.  All right.  Even if you're moving your best friend's stuff, you're knocking it to walls.  Tip it up sideways.  Tip it up.  Right.  Oh, I think it could fit this way.  Hundreds of pounds with the wrong leverage on the feet.  You step over it.  You've got to do that fancy couch math to get it through doorways.  All right.  Tip it up and then turn it sideways.  Oh, it's just banging the wall. 
[03:28:30]  If we flip it as we turn it on a 45-degree angle, I think we can flip it over the stairs.  It's not going to fit.  Get the hammer.  I've got to take the hinges off the door.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fucking nightmare.  He really, this kind of stuff kills him.  Oh, I know.  And, you know, you can't blame him.  It drives me nuts, too.  You just expect something.  When you call somewhere to get something done, you just expect to have it done.  Well, I've told a story on the air. 
[03:29:00]  I got a Sony, like, I don't know, like a 50-inch picture tube.  The biggest they were making at the time.  And it figures the next year the flat screens are all the rage and the price finally drops.  Always the way.  But I have a TV that has to weigh 500 pounds in my living room.  Okay.  And it got delivered, Anthony.  Yeah.  And it was delivered by a bunch of guys that look like they just got out of prison.  Yes.  And they...  Oh, my God. 
[03:29:30]  The couch is going to be stretched.  All right.  I'm just worried because I've been waiting for a long time for this thing.  And I...  But if there's something wrong with it, I know that that's just a chance you take when you  order something, but it's going to be a month's period.  Very nice.  So, do you want me not to deliver it at all?  No, I...  Oh, that sounded like a threat.  Oh, absolutely.  Between 12 and 3, right? 
[03:30:00]  Okay.  Yeah, that's fine.  I can't be there after 5.  Okay.  And they said they won't be taking it in and out.  Okay.  Thank you.  They're going to fuck this couch up now on purpose.  They're going to spit on it.  Yeah, because they're now pissed.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, Jimmy.  She's nice.  I mean, the woman is nice.  Yeah.  She did what she was supposed to do.  They fucked up.  And she said that they...  She called them and told them the concern.  At least she did do that.  And she said they said they'll leave it.  It's going to be on the side of the truck.  I'm sure guys that are unloading furniture all day are going to be very sympathetic now. 
[03:30:30]  To the couch that's in the way.  To the three phone calls that they've gotten.  And don't let anything happen to this couch.  And it's not like they're looking at that couch realizing if they were able to deliver it,  it wouldn't be in the way for all the other deliveries.  Not like their couch at home doesn't have duct tape on the armrest.  Right.  As they're moving someone else's TV off the back of the truck.  They're not just taking a quick kick to the couch that is in their way.  And where would you rather take a break?  Sitting on the tail end of the truck while you eat your lunch? 
[03:31:00]  Or sitting on a nice couch?  They can sit on the couch.  I'm sure it's wrapped.  With your cranky ass.  It's a nice comfy couch.  After you're moving furniture with that ass all day just lathering up.  You know what though?  This is one thing.  I'll tell you that the legs are covered with cardboard or something.  You think they've got the cardboard and the tape around them?  I'm sure they do.  Yeah.  I'm sure they don't just load it.  I don't know why I'm thinking that they're just going to load this thing with nothing on it  other than they're just going to scrape it up and bang.  I have this vision that they're just going to put it on its side on the street. 
[03:31:30]  Of course.  There's nice plastic over it.  Let's go to the Gooch in Cleveland.  The Gooch.  What's up, fellas?  What's up?  I own a delivery company.  Okay.  And you get there in the morning.  You try to schedule deliveries.  Everybody has some type of little fancy thing that they want done.  Everybody's fancy like Jimmy Norton and everything gets fucked up.  I know.  The time thing you're talking about?  Yeah, exactly.  No.  Drop the fucking thing off and leave and stay on schedule.  You can't do that.  Yes, you can.  You get to the little Jewish lady.  I bought this upstairs and she says you're supposed to take the old one. 
[03:32:00]  You get all kinds of shit from people.  Dude, you're right.  People are scumbags.  If I did this correctly, I actually called them yesterday and had they not been able  to reschedule, if they said we can't because it's impossible, we had one of the interns  that was going to help me out and wait there and just make sure that they put it where  I wanted it and didn't scrape the floor.  So I was ready to do that and then she's like, no, no, no, we fixed it.  And then they screwed up on the...  This happened with a time-worn in cable recently.  It's like you talk to somebody and it doesn't get fixed fast enough.  Cable companies are different.  I'm just saying you get there and there's always some kind of fucking problem. 
[03:32:30]  Well, they wouldn't have been with me.  I would have been standing there with bells on.  And hello, gentlemen.  I would have given them a little tip.  Said if you scrape the floor, I'll cry.  Please don't.  And they wouldn't have.  All right.  Well, good luck.  Thanks, fella.  Here goes the Gooch in Cleveland.  John in Jersey.  Go ahead, John.  Yeah.  Jimmy, can't you just call them back and tell them I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio?  She knows I'm on the radio.  I love that from the intro of the show.  She does know I'm on the radio.  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio.  All right.  We got to move on.  Thank you. 
[03:33:00]  Well, we'll see what happens with your couch.  Okay, Jimmy?  Yes.  It's just that you know how it is in life.  You deal with stuff.  You just want stuff done the way you want it done.  Golfing is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.  A true test of dexterity, skill, and, oh, seems to have landed in some dog mess.  Oh, not again.  Ramon, wash my balls.  You guys want to see Dee Dee's sex toys?  I sure do.  Sure.  All right.  Well, here's a whip.  Wow, that's the crop, huh? 
[03:33:30]  That is one of them.  I didn't bring all of them.  A whip.  Well, I didn't.  What can we do with the whip?  Well, die.  It whips somebody.  No, I know that, but can we do that to you today?  Well, I know you're going to.  Hold it up.  How long is that thing?  Is that like an Indiana Jones whip or a crop?  Let's see your technique.  That's a whip.  Anyway, let me see the other stuff.  All right.  There's her whip.  Don't slam that door.  It's killing me today.  It takes out all the oxygen.  Anyone else noticing the pressure change in your ears and stuff?  Yeah.  What is that? 
[03:34:00]  Oh, nipple clams.  Oh, you know what they are.  Nipple clams.  Just assumed.  You kind of figured it out, D.D. Jesus.  And this is probably one of Steve's favorites, right?  A cock ring?  Wow, you got a cock ring?  Steve, have you ever worn a cock ring?  No, I haven't.  I knew what it was when she...  Let me...  Hold that up.  But this is one of my small ones.  Now that would...  Why is it three rings?  That's for your Asian friends?  Are we getting arrested?  All right.  Who's that? 
[03:34:30]  You're in a heap of trouble, boy.  All right.  Sarah?  Yeah, so...  Are these things washed?  Yes, of course.  I clean them.  They're clean.  Yeah, so you can put it in your mouth, Ope.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  That's all right.  Um, yeah.  That...  Now, how does that work?  I'm seeing three rings.  You put it...  You want me to explain that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hold it up and explain it.  Well, you...  It's to stop him from having an erection right away. 
[03:35:00]  What's the point?  Wait.  Wait, who's yelling, what's the point in the other room?  Who's me?  Ari.  Oh, Ari.  You saw this and went through.  We've had Ari on the show before.  Hey, Ari.  You say, stop.  Oh, no.  Yeah, it's just for...  It's a thing.  Many have to know what...  It's a thing.  Did you say to prevent an erection?  Yeah, for a while, yeah.  To prevent an erection for a while?  Why would you want to do that?  Yeah.  To prevent it or to keep it hard?  Because, you know, it's to prevent it from getting hard, yeah.  From getting hard?  I thought it was for... 
[03:35:30]  After it gets hard, it kind of keeps the blood in there.  No, for a while, it's supposed to stop it.  Really?  And now, is there one of those go around the bag?  Well, actually, there's another one.  I didn't bring that, but yeah.  You know a lot about this, sir.  I've never used...  Yeah, but you know that there's another one like that.  I've looked at the back of the magazines, you know.  What's the matter?  What's the matter, Jim?  It's the ring.  I don't go for this.  You don't like it?  No, I certainly don't.  I'll hide it.  No, no, no.  It doesn't bother me like that.  I just don't understand why you'd want that around you.  It's uncomfortable.  Because some men like that. 
[03:36:00]  Wait, what do you do with the ring, though?  He's an easy caddy.  Ben Sparks has one.  It's called a hula hoop.  Is he really that big?  We don't know.  We don't know what's going on down there, but it's giant.  We're trying to figure it out.  Whenever he leaves a basketball store, they stop him for stealing.  I don't know.  It's just like you just use it for fun.  You have to know, like, be into the scene to understand.  Why is there three rings?  Well, there's some with four and five. 
[03:36:30]  I mean, it's just this one has three.  Is it depend on length or something like that?  No.  Is it like gigant or average?  No, it doesn't have anything to do with that.  All right.  That's wonderful.  What else do you have?  All right.  Well, I just brought a few.  I can't bring all.  You've got to save some for later, right?  Of course.  Teasing.  Do we get to whip you?  Well, that's...  Yeah.  Get that Indy whip. 
[03:37:00]  Jimmy, you know how to use the whip?  No.  Never use the whip.  What the hell?  There's police in here.  Yeah.  That's a state trooper, I think.  All right.  We're micing your ass.  I'm afraid, though, because there's a cop in the other room.  It's not illegal to be whipped.  You don't want to be whipped.  He's giving it.  Oh, we can use those.  He's holding up his handcuffs.  He's holding up his handcuffs.  Yes, he is.  Your cuffs.  Yeah, you might want to get cuffed and whipped.  Nice.  Well, like, use the whip on the counter. 
[03:37:30]  I want to see your technique, at least.  I don't really have...  I don't know.  Usually, it's like...  I don't...  What?  It's just like...  You whip.  I'm not going to, like, do it.  I don't know how to use a whip.  I've never used it.  You just...  Show me.  Oh, come on.  You used it.  I've never used a whip.  Are you left-handed, too?  No.  It's just...  Oh, okay.  My mic was in the way.  All right.  Let's see.  I can't.  I don't know how I'm nervous.  Nervous about what?  Nervous about what?  All these guys are...  Who's that one?  They're fans. 
[03:38:00]  You're just demonstrating the whip.  Yeah, let's go.  Yeah, show the whip.  You know how to use the whip.  You just go...  She just whipped Jimmy's arm.  Jesus.  She was trying to whip the floor, and it went awry to the right and nailed Jimmy in the arm.  Jimmy, you all right?  Yeah.  Let me put my face out so you can hit the eye.  Go ahead.  No, just let me see you crack it.  Yeah.  On the floor?  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  I can't do this.  All right.  Here's Dee Dee and her whip. 
[03:38:30]  Well, I'll try it, because I'm a little...  I'm shaky.  Why?  I don't know.  I can't do it.  You just did it.  You're a freak, man.  That is something.  You are.  I'm usually the submissive, though.  The what?  Submissive.  Submissive?  Could Jimmy use the whip on you?  Well, I know that was coming so soon.  I don't know.  I never used the whip before.  Well, just give it a shot.  Just tap her a little bit.  You ever snap the other guy's butts with a towel in the locker room, Jim? 
[03:39:00]  I've never done this before, so I don't know if I'm going to do it.  Oh, did you hear that noise?  Yeah.  Jim, do this.  Go.  Where are you?  That won't...  It won't, uh...  Careful.  You're getting Steve.  See?  He knows what he's doing.  I've never done it before.  Honestly, I've never done it before.  Well, you're doing good.  All right.  Let's bend over there, Dee Dee.  I don't know what the right arm motion is.  I'll just wind up and swing as hard as I can.  I want to hold the end and swing the wood part. 
[03:39:30]  Oh, God.  Sorry.  I'm glad my mom is not looking for it.  All right.  Let's, uh...  We're miking your butt once again.  Sorry.  Wow.  Jimmy just whipped Steve.  Cut it out.  Go a little bit lower.  There you are.  All right.  Let's, uh...  Cut all the mics off.  Yeah.  Well, bend over.  The mics are way down low.  No, I'm not probably...  If I don't do this right, this is my first time using a whip.  Jimmy looks like a natural on the plantation back in the 1800s. 
[03:40:00]  I thought I said I would like a little cream with my coffee.  There is not a mint leaf in my julep, boy.  I could have had you shot.  All right, Jimmy.  How's the whipping hand?  Hold on.  With all the mics, we've got to move.  We move.  We put this one the other way, because I can't whip around the microphone.  We'll just line this up.  Wait, wait, Steve.  Fix that mic.  No, no.  A little...  Yeah.  Right around. 
[03:40:30]  That's good.  Damn it.  I almost had him.  I was setting Steve up for a whipping.  All right, let's turn down the music so we can hear this.  I'm just trying to get the timing down, because I've never looked.  Wait, DeeDee, grab one of the mics if you're going to stand up.  I'm just swinging to get the actual distance.  Oh.  Yeah?  All right.  It's a little light so far.  I'm not doing it.  I'm trying at the distance.  I don't want to, you know.  Right.  Indiana.  Okay, not my back. 
[03:41:00]  Indiana Norton.  Not my back.  That's going to hurt.  Bend over.  Get the butt.  Oh.  Okay, hold on.  That one hurt.  Good.  That one hurt?  Good.  He's a good old gun.  It's starting to sting.  My young son's in the car.  Now, thank you.  I use that kind of language.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  That one looked like it hurt.  It did.  It stings.  I know it stings.  Jimmy's really good. 
[03:41:30]  God.  Jimmy.  These two make a really good couple in a really bizarre way.  Oh, my God.  I got a email.  Oh, my God.  Look at the email.  Look at Jimmy's eyes.  Jimmy really gets into this.  I know.  Oh, that was my thing.  What is that sound?  Who's farting?  What, guess?  Nice.  Did you kind of fart?  Did you guess, DeeDee?  No, I didn't guess.  No, I'm hearing, like, argh. 
[03:42:00]  What is that?  DeeDee, what kind of guesser?  Someone farted.  What?  That wasn't me.  All right, one more.  A couple more here.  All right, hold on.  I have to get the timing now, because I moved.  I'm not just getting the distance, that's all.  Okay, the distance.  Yeah, okay.  Sorry.  I'm watching.  Ah, that was my thing.  I know.  I found going soft.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jimmy's really into this.  Oh.  Did that one hurt?  A little bit of stinging.  Oh, a little stinging, sorry. 
[03:42:30]  Indy, my friend.  Oh, God.  Oh, wow.  That was a good one.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Sorry.  That was a good one.  I just got to get the distance right, that's all.  Uh-huh.  Jimmy's eyes are bugging out.  Your name's Toby.  Toby.  That was, uh, wow.  Give me a water and don't spit in it.  That was impressive, Didi.  That one hurt.  Sorry. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  So what are you going to learn?  No.  All right, Didi, we'll have more news with you in a little while?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Like the whip.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, that was nice.  Yeah, do you enjoy that kind of thing?  No, it has to be with the right kind of person.  Yeah.  Not everybody.  Not a psychopath like Jim?  I don't want to be the psychopath, but I'm just saying that it has to be somebody that  knows what they're doing.  Yeah.  And do you get that on your bear butt?  Like, is that also, yeah? 
[03:43:30]  And does it leave, like, a red mark?  Well, yeah, for a little bit.  It left a red mark yesterday.  I think it would be easier with a shorter one, a little one.  A riding crop.  Oh, I have one of those, too, but I didn't bring it, but I'll save that for next time.  Sure.  I couldn't, like, bring everything.  You've got to bring it a little at a time.  A little at a time.  With this, you've got to get used to how far away you are, because I'm not used to  swing anything that far away.  That was really good.  All right.  Well, you'll bring back some more sex toys the next time we're in D.C.  Okay?  Yeah.  It's Steady, everyone. 
[03:44:00]  She'll be back with more news in a bit here.  That whip's good for jumping over chasms as you're stealing golden idols from caves.  Yeah, that one could do some damage, it looks like.  XM202, the O.P. and Anthony Show. </pre>
