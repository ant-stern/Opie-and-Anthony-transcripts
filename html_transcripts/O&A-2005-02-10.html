<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a detailed recounting of their recent Mardi Gras trip to New Orleans.  The hosts described witnessing, from their hotel balcony, a group of Black men harassing white people on the street, employing extremely offensive racial slurs throughout their description. They detailed the physical assaults and groping, the targeting of white individuals, and the eventual police involvement.  They also recounted their own bead-throwing from the balcony, including an incident where Opie accidentally hit an elderly man on a mobility scooter.  The discussion included their observations of Bourbon Street before and after Mardi Gras, noting the stark contrast.  They shared anecdotes about their airport experiences upon returning, including witnessing a man violently vomiting in an airport and a woman vomiting on a plane.  The segment featured listener calls, one challenging Anthony's use of racial slurs and another from a police officer discussing the legal aspects of racially motivated attacks.  Opie also complained about his disrupted sleep schedule following the trip. The show included commercial breaks for Vermont Teddy Bears and teasers for upcoming segments. No in-studio guests were present during this portion.

The show then transitioned to a discussion on sexual harassment lawsuits, focusing on the perceived disparity in the number of suits filed by women versus men.  The hosts used anecdotal evidence and employed misogynistic and racist language throughout. A humorous, yet offensive, running gag about mealy apples from a specific deli dominated parts of the conversation, veering into tangents about alleged terrorism links and the hosts' dislike of the deli owner. A caller shared a personal experience of filing a sexual harassment suit against a female boss. The segment included a crude and offensive skit about sexual harassment training and concluded with "Hot Teen News," covering a teacher charged with statutory rape, with the hosts providing sexually suggestive and offensive commentary.  No in-studio guests were present, but several callers participated.

The next segment opened with Valentine's Day promotion for Vermont Teddy Bears, highlighting workplace deliveries. This was followed by a discussion of a malfunctioning CD player, involving staff members, including someone named Mars. Anthony recounted his disastrous wedding experience and offered cynical wedding advice.  A listener, Chester, complained about XM commercials.  A news story about two elderly men arrested for telling lawyer jokes outside a courthouse prompted the hosts to share several lawyer jokes. A significant portion was dedicated to a debate about the origins of "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" (WOW), with Opie and Anthony vehemently claiming to be its creators and criticizing Howard Stern for allegedly stealing their material.  A female listener, Kristen, proposed a game of "Guess What's in My Pants," leading to humorous attempts by the hosts to guess what she was doing with her phone. Finally, a caller, Jimmy, mentioned an overheard conversation at K-Rock about Opie and Anthony potentially returning to morning drive time, followed by a discussion of a complaint about a Hillary Clinton-themed promo involving diarrhea.  They also discussed a "boneyard" radio host criticizing their show.

The show continued with a discussion about a misplaced Vermont Teddy Bear commercial on XM and internal communications regarding the error. Tom from New Orleans called in, recounting a trip with the hosts and a debate about who was "cheap" regarding expenses at a strip club, involving Opie, Anthony,  "Master Poe," and the unavailable Ben.  This led to a discussion of the Hillary Clinton promo and a subsequent, intentionally ridiculous alternative. Jokes regarding Clinton's health and bodily functions were made.  Starker Patty, a news reader auditioning for the show, attempted to deliver news, but her first story (related to Vermont Teddy Bear) was deemed inappropriate due to pedophilia allegations. She then covered American Airlines eliminating pillows, a Knicks loss, Jason Giambi's steroid confession, and a body found in a water tank, all interspersed with comedic interjections from the hosts.  Flavor Flav then appeared as an in-studio guest with a VH1 camera crew, discussing his appearance on "Surreal Life," his interactions with Bridget Nielsen, and his career. The segment included a musical interlude by Will Dogey and more listener calls.

The final segment addressed fatherhood and relationships, interspersed with a Vermont Teddy Bear advertisement.  One host discussed his children, his status as a grandfather, and his daughter's young motherhood.  The other host joked about raising the first hostâ€™s children.  Flavor Flav, still present, participated in a Vermont Teddy Bear commercial, promoting Valentine's Day delivery.  The conversation included references to Flavor Flav's romantic life and employed explicit language.

[00:02:30]  XM202  XM202  XM202  XM202  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  In the wee hours of the morning, while the city sleeps, an uncommon band of heroes unites to fight the forces of evil. 
[00:03:30]  The Obi and Anthony Show.  Oh, my sweet Jesus.  With A-Cup.  I want to be known as Notorious.  No.  A-C-A-C.  Everyone is always in my way.  Oh, you really are deluded.  And B-Cup.  Kind of fat-breasted and awful.  And surrounded by dullards.  Ben looks like poorly spliced film.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Whenever Steve yawns, it looks like the back of the Batmobile and it looks like...  Paucatosis.  Eric, you're not going to cry.  Shut up. 
[00:04:00]  And armed with superhuman powers.  He holds his pants down and just starts leaking into someone's garbage can.  That's rule one.  How about if he gives you the old chin cap with his helmet?  That's all right with me.  They are living among us.  Average citizens.  Average heroes.  Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place.  Controversial talkers Opie and Anthony.  We are just nicks.  You better just sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:04:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh!  You're just a tool.  You can keep your hands off of my mule.  Eh, eh, eh.  Anyway.  Stay out the bushes. 
[00:05:00]  You little scumbag.  I got your name.  I got your ass.  I don't blame you.  He was banging cocktail wings with his two at a time.  Ow!  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  Ow!  Oh, ow!  I'm Big Dick Black.  Oh!  It's over, Johnny.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh! 
[00:05:30]  You like Huey Lewis and the nurse?  Is that so?  Who made you pulp in this dump, huh?  It's easy to grin when your ship comes in and you've got the stock market beat.  But the man worthwhile is the man who can smile when his shorts are too tight in the seat. 
[00:06:00]  Okay, poofy.  Okay, poofy.  There's always one that makes me laugh every morning.  Love that guy.  Hey, good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  Hello.  Back on our home turf of New York City.  Nice to be home.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  What?  My God.  Didn't we just land? 
[00:06:30]  They sure screwed up my sleeping hours.  Just a little bit.  It was pretty nice to do afternoons for a little while there for a couple of days.  I'll tell you.  God damn, is that nice just waking up whenever the hell you want.  You don't have to be to bed early.  Like an infant.  I feel like I'm seven years old again and I have my beddy-bye time.  So you can get up for school.  Well, Anthony, time for bed.  It's 7.30.  It was like when I was a kid.  I'd be like, can't I stay up and watch Ronan Martin's Laugh-In? 
[00:07:00]  All I know is we touched down in Newark.  I got back to New York City.  It was 5 o'clock and I was just watching the clock until it turned to 8 o'clock so I could go to bed.  I made it to 7.20 and said, ah, screw it.  Wow, 7.20.  So then I go to bed at 7.20 and I hear people coming into my building because, yeah, they probably work late.  Getting home from work a little later than usual. 
[00:07:30]  I'm just like people coming home from work and you're sleeping.  I'm already in bed for the night.  Getting pissed off at them because they're open.  You know, you can hear the door opening on the front of the apartment and they're going up the stairs, stuff like that.  And they have every right to just walk up the stairs at 7.20.  Yeah, because they're sleeping.  It's not like it's 4 in the morning and someone's coming home drunk and obnoxious.  You know, they're just coming home from work.  Coming home from a hard day's work.  But it drove me nuts because I'm like, don't they understand it's Betty-bye time?  Betty-bye.  It's Betty-bye time? 
[00:08:00]  Well, I had the opposite problem.  I just couldn't imagine staying up any later than that yesterday after all the traveling.  I had the opposite problem.  I couldn't get to sleep because I didn't wake up early.  You know, unless I'm up at 4.30 or 4.15 or whatever the hell it is every morning, I can't get to sleep that night.  You know, so I woke up, I don't know, probably 9 o'clock in New Orleans before we left.  The car was outside at like 9.30, so I got every minute's sleep I could. 
[00:08:30]  And that was it.  I didn't get to sleep until after 11.  Yeah, a quick observation.  I did get up early yesterday and decided to grab my cup of coffee and get one more look at Bourbon Street.  First of all, the day after Fat Tuesday, it's a completely different street.  Yep.  It is spotless.  There's no sign of puke, beads, scum.  Nothing.  It is, I don't know, they got that down pat.  No people.  No people look like a completely different street, right?  So I walk about two blocks from the hotel, like I did every morning with my coffee, just kind of getting, you know, waking up and going for a little walk. 
[00:09:00]  I got accosted like within 15 to 20 feet of the hotel by undesirables.  The undesirables just, you know, take over the neighborhood after everyone leaves after Fat Tuesday.  After?  That is a dangerous, dangerous road when Mardi Gras is not going on.  I made it two blocks and realized, you know what, I better get back to the safety of the hotel immediately.  Undesirables.  All the bars were closed. 
[00:09:30]  Everything was boarded up.  You know, there were just street cleaners still, you know, or actually building owners or their workers just scrubbing the fronts of their building.  That's all that was going on.  There was no sign that there was just a huge party for the last week or so.  Well, it seems the undesirables, they get started a little early before it ends because me and Jimmy saw just, it made me wretch.  We're up on the balcony of the hotel last night, you know, it's a few hours before they clean the streets off and send everyone home, I guess. 
[00:10:00]  So we're, you know, throwing beads off the balcony.  And across the street from the hotel balcony, there's about 12 or so black gentlemen standing against the wall.  And people are walking by on the sidewalk.  And they're standing against the wall on the sidewalk.  And when other black gentlemen would walk by, they'd kind of shake hands with them, you know, little hand jive gesture things there. 
[00:10:30]  Black chicks would walk by.  If they were hot, they'd grab ass on the chicks and they'd spin around and like, you know, yell at them, don't touch me.  And they'd laugh, you know, send them on their way.  Then we noticed when Whitey walked by, a white guy or a white chick or, God forbid, a couple walked by, they would smack them in the head, knock their hats off their head, molest the girls, like feeling their tits, grabbing ass, grabbing crotch of the girls. 
[00:11:00]  And, God forbid, the guy turns around and, you know, tries to stand up for his girl's honor and says something.  Because we saw this one guy, he turned around to one of these black guys with his shirt off, just, just, like, drugged out of his mind and said something like, put his hands up and went, you know, what's up, what are you doing?  The black guy just hauled off and cracked them right in the face.  All of them start laughing.  The one guy that punched him runs away now. 
[00:11:30]  You know, he doesn't even stay there.  The guy staggers into the wall that he hit, almost goes on his ass.  He kind of kept it together and walked away.  And then they're just laughing their asses off, doing this to white guys that are walking by.  Only the white guys.  They're smacking their hats off their head.  And guys are turning around and going, what's up?  And the guy squares off like he's going to hit him and he's got all his buddies with him.  So, one white guy, what's he going to do, you know?  Got to back down.  Got to get his ass beat.  Got to get punched in the face.  So, this went on for a good 40 minutes or so, I guess. 
[00:12:00]  You guys were watching this whole thing?  Oh, yeah.  We stopped from the beach.  Didn't you tell me that they were making out with the guy's chicks, too?  One guy comes by and he's with this drunk whore.  They're both white.  And somehow the black group on the corner gets them divided.  And they were just grabbing girls' arms and pulling them and hugging them and groping them and humping them.  And the guy tries to, the guy's drunk, too.  So, he kind of loses the girl. 
[00:12:30]  And they're probably five, six feet apart from each other.  But the black gentlemen have positioned themselves where they could no longer see each other.  And the girl's just being felt up.  The black guy starts making out with the chick.  She has no idea where she is.  She's like annihilated, snotted drunk.  And then they start smacking the white guy around.  So, finally, he, like, wakes up a little bit and notices where the girl is and tries to pull her away.  And the one black guy has got her by the arm and just a tug of war with the guy's chick.  That's amazing. 
[00:13:00]  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable the savagery that was going on on that corner.  And from what I hear, other corners, this is kind of a thing that's known.  It happens.  The black youth, black gentlemen in New Orleans over there at Mardi Gras just harass white people.  It's just this racial thing that goes on.  And I've got to tell you, from the balcony, you look down, and it's very hard for the word nigger not to come out of your mouth.  You know?  I'm not the guy that throws the word around. 
[00:13:30]  I don't throw it around when people are going to work in the morning.  I'm not like that.  You don't throw it around while we're broadcasting, anyway.  While we're broadcasting, anyway.  Right.  You know something?  You're the worst.  I would say 99.9% of white people don't throw that word around when you just see a black guy.  People are under this misconception that if you see a black person, you're going to throw that word around.  You know?  Because there's such rampant racism in this country.  No, it's not true. 
[00:14:00]  It isn't.  You know?  We have plenty of black friends that come up here.  We have black friends out of the show and stuff.  You don't use the word to them.  But when we were watching that, they're acting like niggers.  And that's what the word that comes out of your mouth.  Why?  Because maybe they should kill someone before you use racial slurs and epithets like that.  They were being judged on the content of their character.  And that word was the only word I could use at that moment to describe their actions at what they were doing. 
[00:14:30]  And until stuff like that changes, that word ain't going nowhere.  That ain't going nowhere.  All I kept thinking watching it is Bernie Getz is a hero.  Yeah.  I now...  If I had a gun...  I was enraged.  I would have started shooting for those other people.  Right.  Right.  It was that bad, huh?  It was so...  Enraging.  Enraging to watch.  You could not fathom how pissed we were getting watching this.  If they were smacking black guys walking by, you know something? 
[00:15:00]  I probably wouldn't have had that big a deal about it if it was white and black guys.  Right.  Because then it wouldn't have been racial.  It would have been these guys are angry sons of bitches that are looking for a fight.  You ever see an Irish guy at a bar that's just looking for a fight?  And he doesn't care who the hell steps up to him.  And it's usually his brother or cousin or something.  Are you talking about the black Irish?  No, I'm just talking about the Irish.  The Irish or a drunk Italian at one of those Brooklyn Dago bars that are just looking for a fight. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  And they don't care who it is.  You know something?  I'll stay out of their way and I got no problem with that.  But these sons of bitches were just out for whitey.  They were just...  It was a race crime.  It was racially biased hate on these guys' part.  And it had nothing to do with anything but, here's white guys.  Let's get ours now today.  Let's make up for 400 years or something. 
[00:16:00]  There.  At Mardi Gras.  So, after about 40 minutes or so of watching and just getting pissed off as all hell,  we notice in the crowd about four or five cops are working their way over.  And they're looking up at the balcony above us and pointing at the wall  and trying to get some kind of acknowledgement of where the problem was.  And then they finally get a line on it and the cops run over, grab a lot of these guys  and grab the one that really was belting people in the face, just grab him by the back of the head 
[00:16:30]  and smash his face into the wall.  And that's when I lost my voice.  I'm just screaming, have fun in jail, you mother...  I'm screaming, screaming.  And this guy didn't put up a fight when the cops were there.  He's belting drunk white people and groping their drunken girlfriends walking down the street.  But when a big bull cop comes over and smashed his face against the building,  he sure shut up lickety-split, didn't he?  And these cops down in New Orleans, man, they don't put up for anything. 
[00:17:00]  And there was an eight-year-old, about an eight-year-old, nine-year-old boy with them  that was grabbing girls' crotches, taunting people, smacking people in the head.  He's eight or nine years old, and here he is growing up with this fine leadership,  showing what it's like to laugh as they pop Whitey in the face.  I've never felt more like an old man in my life.  I know.  When those cops came over and Anthony was screaming,  spend the night in jail, and we're all yelling, that'll show you. 
[00:17:30]  We're just like old people.  I think I shook my fist.  Get off my lawn!  Yeah, you should be in school, shouldn't you?  It was awful.  Meanwhile, 12 hours ago, one of my closest friends is pelting a 90-year-old man  on a little rascal with beads, and I'm cheering and laughing.  Hey, man, that story's getting a little out of hand, by the way.  I gently tossed him, thinking he wanted to be part of the festivities.  You know, you did gently toss him from the second-floor balcony across the street.  It was a very gentle toss. 
[00:18:00]  Randy Johnson, you whizzed him, and you hit him in his head, and he turned to the left,  and he was hurt and upset and embarrassed.  It certainly was.  You're making more of it than it was, Jimmy.  The message boards are going crazy about this story, and I want to defend myself.  I figured that everyone down below us, they were all equal.  Fair game.  See, that's what we do.  In my eyes, that's how we operate, equal opportunity.  I don't see skin color like Anthony.  We didn't care who we pelted.  I don't see gender.  I don't see handicaps. 
[00:18:30]  To me, everyone is equal down below when I'm throwing my beads.  Everyone's a victim.  Everyone is deservant of some Mardi Gras beads, is what I thought.  Just pelt the public.  Yeah, I just noticed that when you hit the 80-year-old man on the little rascal,  that was the one time you didn't turn around and duck behind the,  because we would throw something and then hide behind the thing because we're cowards.  But as soon as tough ass hit the 80-year-old man on the little rascal,  he just stood there and openly laughed because what's the guy going to do?  Get up and, you know, you're such a liar. 
[00:19:00]  Crippled old man.  Turn his head.  You're such a liar.  But no one beats Ben.  No one beats Ben.  Sure, you hit old people, but Ben's lobbing beads at infants in carriages.  Aiming at them.  Oh.  Was he aiming at them?  Of course he was.  All pissed off that their little head proportion to the body was bigger than his.  Little infant head.  You'd see a baby carriage and you'd see beads flying down towards it.  You'd hear.  The baby's in the carriage herkeying and jerking in similar fashion.  Little balled up fists. 
[00:19:30]  You know, we've got to talk really fast about this.  So we're there for Fat Tuesday, obviously, and it's getting close to midnight.  And there's, what are you doing?  I'm sorry, he's cleaning up.  Cleaning up what?  He's coming over on Opie's side.  Are you insane?  He's a mad person.  You're trying to clean up my OCD?  Are you insane?  Go see my apartment right now.  Try to clean that up.  Because I can't figure it out.  I'm sure there's a lot of mouse shit that needs cleaning.  I thought you had a housekeeper.  Cleaning up?  This is organized chaos right now.  I know where everything is at this point. 
[00:20:00]  Don't touch it.  Don't touch anything.  Are you insane?  It's a crazy person going over there.  He's lost his mind being here alone for a few days.  Anyway, Fat Tuesday.  And then there's a huge rumor that, yeah, midnight, man.  You just want to be indoors.  You don't want to be around when the cleanup crew comes.  When they hose down.  And we're all on balconies like, oh no, they even shut the balconies down.  They don't even want people, you know, watching this whole thing that goes on at midnight.  Remember?  It was like a whole rumor that was just circulating.  And everyone's like, is it midnight soon? 
[00:20:30]  You know, can I get another drink before midnight?  Midnight.  Midnight.  Midnight.  So then someone calls the strip club we were broadcasting from, the Crazy Horse.  By the way, they were great to us.  They were unbelievable to us.  And they said that we could go up on that balcony to check up the cleanup crew at midnight.  And the cops and the horses.  It's this whole spectacle that happens every year, right?  So we think we're privileged.  We're up on the balcony of the Crazy Horse.  And all of a sudden you see in the distance all this crazy lights, police sirens.  And you can see that what looks like mounted, you know, police on horses, you can't really 
[00:21:00]  tell yet because it's so far in the distance.  But you know something's coming.  You're like, holy yes.  And like we were saying, you know, the Bourbon Street is just a river of people.  You can barely move down there.  Yeah.  And slowly but surely this thing comes and it's the cop cars with their sirens are going.  And then you've got the state troopers and then you've got the National Guard it looked  like and the local police and horses and then the sanitation department and dump trucks 
[00:21:30]  and these water sprayers that were like unbelievable.  Yeah, spraying the street there.  They could have used the hoses to take care of that one situation you were talking about  earlier, Anthony.  And they used to.  And then it occurs to me that this is just a show, obviously.  Yeah.  It's just a show.  Part of the show.  It's pretty much, you know, a chance to give the cops and everybody that is keeping New  Orleans, you know, pretty much under control.  For the most part.  Yeah.  It's their way of getting props for what they did all week or whatever. 
[00:22:00]  The last parade.  It's the last parade, basically.  Because this incredible thing came by with the horses and the sanitation department and  the huge hoses and the cops.  And then everyone just went back in the street and started partying after they passed their  section of Bourbon Street.  Yeah, you thought they chased everyone away, but no.  I think we missed that, dude.  I think when I saw the street the next morning, I saw at Opsaw, which was an absolutely immaculate  street.  Yeah.  For it to go from the chaos it was to that cleanliness, something happened.  Yeah.  We missed it. 
[00:22:30]  We went to bed a little too early.  If we'd have stayed another hour, I bet you would have seen them really hosing it down  and chasing people, because there's no reason for it to be that empty.  Yeah.  Unless they really booted everyone.  Jerry in Arizona has a little problem with me, I guess.  I would love to.  No problem.  I guarantee you misinterpreted what you said.  Let's go to Jerry in Arizona.  Jerry, what's up?  Hey.  I want to talk to Opie, I mean Anthony, about dropping the N-word.  Yeah.  You want to be a real tough guy standing on the balcony there.  Uh-huh.  I didn't say it. 
[00:23:00]  I didn't yell it out on the balcony.  I was saying it to Jimmy.  No, you didn't yell it out, because you're a real tough guy on the radio.  It's not a...  No, dude.  Jerry, it's not about...  He's not talking about...  What he was saying was that was the reaction you had watching it.  He was saying that this is his base angry reaction, and that's what he's saying.  He's not...  We don't throw the word around, hey, this is what these guys were.  That was the reaction you had watching something like that.  Right.  It was this base rage, and he was being honest about the feeling that you had watching it.  That's what he was talking about.  Well, still, even though, man, I mean, you said, you know, on the radio, oh, well, that's 
[00:23:30]  what they were, and, you know, that's what they was acting like.  You know, if that's the case, why don't you guys go down there and, you know, try to break  it up, you know.  All right, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, let me address why we didn't go down there, because we would  have been killed if we would have went down there to 12 black guys and said, excuse me,  I think you're acting like a nigger.  I believe we would have been stabbed and beaten to death.  Jerry, do you think that's a smart thing to have done? 
[00:24:00]  Okay, now, does it matter if it was 12 black guys or 12 white guys or...  The problem, Jerry, I know what you're saying, but the problem is they were just targeting  white...  It's amazing how race is looked at in our country.  Anthony's talking about an honest reaction for something.  Not...  We don't run around screaming, hey, look at these niggers.  No one was saying that.  It was just a reaction from watching it, and he was relaying that reaction, that face reaction.  You want to think of the worst possible way you can describe these people, the way they're  acting, and that's it.  I'm sorry. 
[00:24:30]  That's it.  And, Jerry, let me make something perfectly clear.  If it was 12 Girl Scouts down there causing problems, Anthony wouldn't have went down there  either, so...  Yeah, exactly.  He wasn't leaving his spot on the south.  Anthony wouldn't, but Jimmy probably wouldn't have.  Dude, if you've listened to this show enough, you know that we don't...  There's no...  We don't talk like that on the air.  It's not because we're not allowed to.  It's just not the way we think.  But, in that case, it was just a base rage reaction, and they were targeting people just  because they were white.  We watched it happening.  So, it was like...  Hey, I listen to this show all the time, so... 
[00:25:00]  So, you know, that's the first time you've heard that on this show, and it was a description  of something that happened two nights ago.  Well, he says, Ant's tough on the air, but didn't say it in person.  You would have to be insane and suicidal to go down there and even...  Not even confront them or say anything.  Walk past them.  Yeah.  If you're a white guy walking past these guys, you have to be crazy if you knew the situation.  We were watching people walk by and just going, oh, no, look at this couple that's coming  up.  They're done.  Trying to move them with your mind.  Yeah.  Please, get off the street.  Don't get into the street. 
[00:25:30]  Don't walk next to them.  Go around.  You don't know what you're in for.  But, you see, that's a perfect example when you describe something like that, and you give  like what the honest thought at that moment was.  It is honest.  And people react like, oh, that was a racist.  No.  99% of the human population looking at that situation would have thought the same exact  goddamn thing.  Don't bullshit me.  Would have thought the same thing.  Why are you going to come up...  You're not going to...  Oh, I don't want to use that offensive word to describe one of the most offensive scenes 
[00:26:00]  you can possibly see?  Can you imagine if that was...  And again, it happens in New Orleans all the time.  Can you imagine if that was like 12 skinheads...  Right.  ...down there targeting only black couples and just, you know, grabbing the women and  accosting them and punching some of the guys in the face, it would have at least made  the papers.  Would have been hate crime.  Absolutely.  They would have been arrested just like the black guys were.  Yeah.  But you know damn well the charges would have been a little different.  It would have been simple assault or something like that, whatever they dragged that guy  in.  Right.  Would have been one of those civil rights cases.  They're not going to have...  They're not going to have anything on these guys, though. 
[00:26:30]  No, they won't, because the guy that...  They're pretty much going to be everyone they hit walked away.  The one guy they may have an assault on, if somebody else saw it, they may be able  to get the one guy for a basic assault.  No, no, no.  They're probably released by now.  Just lock them up.  Let him go.  Right, right.  That's it.  Lock them up for 12 to 16 hours, and they're on the street again.  I'm sure he's going to be a productive member of society somewhere down the line, I'm sure.  Unless someone just happened to have a video camera.  It is Mardi Gras.  They can show the cops right on the spot, well, this is exactly what he did.  Everything is recorded down there. 
[00:27:00]  It's amazing.  Henry in Florida.  What's up, Henry?  Henry, all right, thanks for the phone call.  It was great, thanks.  What's wrong with your phone, Henry?  All right, why don't we take a break, Anthony?  We're just getting started.  We've got some great things to get to today, I'll tell you.  Got to talk about the couple that are going to wed at Dunkin' Donuts.  We've got to talk about the mermaid baby.  Oh, the mermaid baby.  That sounds so cute.  We've got to talk about...  You see the picture?  Ah!  The corpse in the water tank. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, boil your water, Jersey.  We've got to talk about stick-em-up, I have a gub.  Stick-em-up, I have a gub.  Was Rich Voss trying to rob a bank?  It's unbelievable.  The guy spelled gun wrong.  What else?  I have a gub.  We've got to talk about the Golden Gates, 23 miles of gates in Central Park.  I saw that last night.  Oh.  They're starting to get that together. 
[00:28:00]  Great.  It's going to be in Central Park for a week.  Also, Cosby groping chicks.  Grr.  And...  Is he on a corner in Mardi Gras this weekend?  I went to Mardi Gras.  It was great.  Grr.  Pull your panties down.  I'll put some ice cream on it.  I took some Jell-O pudding and put it in a foodie.  And then I punched Whitey in the head.  Come here, Rudy.  Rudy, come here.  When this white person walks by, I'm going to knock his hat off. 
[00:28:30]  Then I want you to kick him in the balls.  Grr.  Cosby's a class act.  Why did you come to this city, Whitey?  I'm going to hit him with a pudding pop.  Cosby's groping, yeah.  Yeah, hold on.  A cop wants in on this.  All right.  I'm a cop you idiot.  John from PA. 
[00:29:00]  What's up, John?  John Kimball.  John, go ahead, man.  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Great to hear you guys back on the radio.  Right on.  Listen, I'm coming over from work now.  I'm a cop right outside of Philly.  Yeah.  You there?  Yeah, we are here, sir.  We're good listeners.  Sorry.  You're absolutely right about them charges.  If it was a white guy being arrested for that, you'd be damn right.  There would be racial intimidation. 
[00:29:30]  You can get federal charges put on you.  You get federal charges put on you when it's some kind of racial hate crime.  But if it's blacks against whites, it's not a hate crime.  It's just assault.  Believe it or not, that is the arrogance of the liberal left.  Yeah.  There is this intellectual elitism that liberals have where they feel that, like, well, blacks aren't really capable of that type of thought to have these racially biased crimes.  That's why they only hold other whites accountable for racial crimes, because they see other whites as equals, and they feel that they should be held accountable. 
[00:30:00]  Blacks are like children.  They shouldn't be held accountable.  That's the way the liberal left sees it.  The liberal left sees it as white people can make a decision and say, I'm going to do this racial hate crime, and they should be held accountable for it.  But they believe black people don't have that in them to be able to make this decision and distinguish that, so you just got to give it to them.  Yeah, it's a more honest thing for black people just to behave that way, but white people should know better.  That is the subtle arrogance of the left.  That's it. 
[00:30:30]  All right.  And also, we've got to talk about Prince Charles getting married.  Hey, quite a looker.  Oh, my God.  And then our buddies there that were telling the lawyer jokes, we got an update on that.  That's a great little story coming out of Long Island.  Can we talk about that one day?  No, we never got to the story, but there's an update on those guys, which is pretty funny and pretty cool.  And in closing on that whole thing, white people shouldn't be as angry at situations like that as successful black people who try to better themselves and their people than these animals roaming around the streets like this. 
[00:31:00]  Because it really does make things more difficult for black people that just actually work in this society, work with this society, and become successful, raise a family, and just act like you're supposed to act.  Like everyone is supposed to act.  And this just really, that is what really wrecks it for a whole group of people. 
[00:31:30]  And I, thank you.  And I believe in the future this will not be a problem, but it must be overcome now.  We must all unite as one people, as Americans, not white Americans, black Americans, or Asian Americans.  We all must come together and use this fine country of ours as a group, as one, as Americans. 
[00:32:00]  And when you see fights on the corner like that, I know the N-word pops into your head. I know it.  Don't lie to me.  Maybe Rick can write a song parody about Mardi Gras.  Get us all thrown off the air.  Run, Whitey, run.  Run, Whitey, run.  Walk down the street, a fist right through his head. 
[00:32:30]  All right.  Well, very good, Anthony.  Thank you for that.  Thank you.  Yeah, no problem.  As we go to break, a little spoop spot on being a technical virgin.  I've got big plans for my future.  A good college, a career, maybe even my own business someday.  But one thing I'm not planning on is getting pregnant.  That's why I choose anal sex.  I mean, sure, it hurts a little, and I wind up walking funny for a day or two. 
[00:33:00]  But I think my future's worth it.  Anal sex, the smart choice for your future.  Steve, Steve the Bear.  Steve, Steve the Bear.  Sweet Steve the Bear. 
[00:33:30]  Sweet face, so cozy.  We go back to his place and in his cave.  He shows me his flame hat.  I wonder how he can wear that.  Wonder how many cubs got caught in his bear trap.  His flaming clothes are exotic, homoerotic.  And like Steve, it should have never came out the closet.  But if you wear it, the sideburn's got to be in good shape.  Can't be a cozy bear if your hair don't look great.  Steve.  Steve the Bear.  Sweet Steve.  Steve the Bear. 
[00:34:00]  The OBN Anthony Show.  Sam 2 Hotel.  The OBN Anthony Show.  The OBN Anthony Show.  Take it on me.  The OBN Anthony Show.  Take it on me.  Ah, the O-N-A virus spreading across America.  Yeah.  Big hi to everyone that got their radios turned on.  That was the break?  Yeah, that was it, man. 
[00:34:30]  That's all you get, Pally.  Oh, my God.  I actually had three bites of eggs.  I listened to Anthony just talk about, you know, what he said.  Well, we don't want to know who they are.  And all of a sudden, we got to hear what Anthony really thinks.  He thought it was harsh on the air.  I was reading instant feedback.  Yeah.  I think some of the listeners didn't quite get my point.  Why don't you read some of the instant feedbacks live on the air there, buddy?  I didn't understand when you were talking about race mixing and you said,  and there'll be a mongrel race and both races will be destroyed. 
[00:35:00]  And I will die before I'll yield one inch.  I don't remember saying that at all.  It's so hard to just be honest these days, isn't it?  Try to put yourself out there.  Give an honest appraisal of one man's emotion watching some scene of racial carnage.  And, you know, that's what happens.  Libby from Wisconsin, that's it.  Blame the liberal left for everything again.  Paranoid much, assholes? 
[00:35:30]  I'm not blaming the liberal left.  And wait, I just want to make something perfectly clear.  That's Jim Norton's argument always?  Yes.  Not always.  It depends.  What I'm arguing is hate crimes.  When dealing with the hate crime legislation,  I'm not blaming the liberal left for anything other than the mentality behind hate crimes  and who is prosecuted for them and who is not prosecuted for them.  There you go.  That's who I'm attacking the left for.  So, again, stop being the typical paranoid left.  I'm not attacking you for everything.  I'm talking about this.  So if you want instant feedback, call in and we'll discuss it. 
[00:36:00]  Stupid.  There you go.  Dope.  Nice liberal professor that spoke in Colorado again, too.  Oh, yeah.  Nice, right?  The left is really a very relevant group.  All right.  One more thing about New Orleans.  First of all, the airport stinks.  Oh, yeah.  Club Soda Candy got us to the airport nice and early  because everyone was leaving Mardi Gras, you know?  I mean, after Fat Tuesday, there's no reason to be anywhere near New Orleans.  You just want to get out.  Until Jazz Week or whatever they call it, the Jazz Festival, which I think is in May,  which a lot of people say is a lot cooler to go to 
[00:36:30]  because you've got the party atmosphere, but you can kind of move around and do some things.  And you can check out some shops and things like that.  Bourbon Street is all just bars and strip clubs.  What happens to that the rest of the year?  I guess every weekend, you know, that's the place to go.  Every weekend becomes like Mardi Gras.  Yeah, like Chippewa Street up there in Buffalo, the same situation.  Really?  Every weekend, it just gets crowded and nuts for the locals and for the colleges and for the surrounding areas.  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah.  But you get on those side streets and you get the cool coffee shops, the little jazz clubs, the nice restaurants, you know? 
[00:37:00]  Not the touristy part.  No.  Bourbon Street is all about just a booze fest.  Yeah.  And so Kenny gets us to the airport early and, of course, there's lines like crazy because everyone's, you know, flying out.  And you could tell there's a lot of hungover people.  Oh, they looked awful.  And so we check in.  We have, what, like two hours before our flight and there's nothing to do in that airport.  I mean, nothing.  Yeah.  Nowhere to go, nowhere to really eat. 
[00:37:30]  No bar lounge type thing to hang out in.  Nothing.  So we're just sitting around and, you know, just killing time.  And, well, we've got to get Ben for this.  He's the only other person I think saw this.  We were kind of eating at separate tables here and there.  We're spread out.  And I saw this guy running through the airport powerbooting because everyone is hungover, man.  Everyone is hungover.  Most of these people probably stayed up all night and went right to the airport.  Yeah. 
[00:38:00]  And I saw this guy running trying to make it to the bathroom.  You saw the guy powerbooting, right, Ben?  Right in the airport.  This guy was running.  He knew he had seconds.  And he was like, he was trying to find where the bathroom was.  He was kind of trying to ask somebody, like, you know, he was making, you know, sign, you know.  Yeah.  That makes you puke right here in the airport.  And all of a sudden he starts booting and booting and booting.  And then he puts his hands up to his mouth and now it's just spraying through his hands. 
[00:38:30]  That's how much puke this guy had to get rid of.  It was unbelievable.  And then, so there's puke all over this one wall.  You know the wall there?  It was kind of like a cement wall with little flowers.  You know, not flower, like plants on top of it.  Yeah.  And a little, like, maybe a place you could, you know, maybe put your bag down for a second  as you look at your airline ticket or whatever.  And all of a sudden these two old broads have no idea this guy just ran by powerbooting all over the wall.  Next thing you know they're just kind of leaning up against the wall. 
[00:39:00]  Taking a look at their flight info.  And they're going to wonder later, like, what is that?  I smell vomit.  It was unbelievable.  They're leaning and the guys puke.  Dude, this guy, it was spraying through his hands.  He was trying to keep it in him so bad and no way.  Worse is being hung over on a travel day.  It's the worst thing ever.  And that was, I missed that, but I did see the girl in the plane.  I saw that, too.  That was disgusting.  We landed at Newark and we're all, you know how you wait for that cabin door to open up 
[00:39:30]  so everyone gets up in the aisle.  They start getting their overhead and we hear from behind us.  Wait, can I make it perfectly clear, though?  Make it perfectly clear.  Sorry, because I know what people are going to be thinking here.  It was a relatively smooth flight.  It really was.  Yeah, no turbulence.  No, this was blatantly hungover.  Yeah, okay.  I just wanted to...  Yeah, exactly.  Go ahead.  And we hear from behind us, can I get through?  Can I get through?  Please?  And everyone kind of looks at the girl and she's trying to make her way through. 
[00:40:00]  She's got her hand up by her mouth and her hand is kind of wet.  And she goes, in that I have something in my mouth sound, she goes, let me see if I can do it with water.  Oh, what are you going to do?  I'm throwing off.  Oh, my God.  I'm throwing off.  That was it.  Yeah.  I'm throwing off.  So everyone just, like, clears the way.  She runs to the bathroom.  Now, for some reason, the stew, the stewardess, the, yeah, she didn't want to shut the bathroom door. 
[00:40:30]  I don't know if there's some kind of regulation about the bathroom door being shut when they're at the gate.  I have no idea.  Stewardess.  The stewardess.  What?  I think I'll be commenting on the more 1967 vernacular that you're throwing out.  The sexy stew?  No, I was saying it earlier and he was correcting me.  That's all.  Flight attendant.  No, they're just, he's right.  Stewardess.  They're waitresses.  I want the ones that look like Helen. 
[00:41:00]  You know, with the flight cap on, look like Jimmy's imaginary.  Frosted beehive hair.  Yeah.  Just loving you when no one else does.  The Boeing 707.  They're gay waiters and waitresses in the air.  You're saying that all the guy flight attendants were gay?  Did you see the guys that were working first class?  Oh, Lord.  You need one of these, sir?  Oh, Lord.  A lot of steam was escaping every time.  And he talked.  Yeah, for some reason, all the flight attendants, male flight attendants, are gay. 
[00:41:30]  And don't tell me, no, dude, I'm a flight attendant and I bang all, yeah, all right, whatever, dude.  Yeah.  Sure you do.  Sure.  All right, you're the guy.  You're the guy that decided I need to get into this profession to bang women.  Yeah, okay, I get it.  She, uh, yeah, because they're not banging the pilots that have the cool jobs, all right?  No, you know, between you serving drinks in first class and the dude that's, you know,  flying the freaking two-ton thing across America. 
[00:42:00]  Pilots.  She's going to decide to bang you at the hotel.  Two-ton plane over.  I know.  How much is it worth?  Well, I don't know, probably 500 tons.  My car is like four tons.  Between who are you going to bang?  Is it the flight attendant or Wilbur Wright?  Oh, he flew in a sop with camel.  Yes, the burlap stayed on the wings this time.  Two tons of her.  I had a very good observation.  A two-ton plane? 
[00:42:30]  I'm messing up with one stupid little detail.  Who are you going to bang?  The flight attendant or John Denver here flying the plane?  It is ultralight.  All right, I get it, all right?  But there you go.  But, yeah, I think these hot, you know, waitresses that take care of you when you fly.  Sky waitress, yeah.  Sure.  Are banging the pilots.  Of course.  Not you.  Well, the stew, she had to, for some reason now, take a curtain and kind of cover the door. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, what was that about?  That was open.  I don't know.  She wouldn't shut the bathroom door.  I think she wanted to make sure maybe she was okay or something.  I had no clue.  I think because the girl dropped to her knees and her legs were such that they couldn't get the door closed.  Oh, very good.  I didn't even think of that.  And small bathrooms.  She went on her knees.  And she was just now, let's use another term, she was just yorking.  It was.  She was just yorking.  I swear to you, and I'm not even, I'm not exaggerating at all.  Because the door was open, maybe, maybe that's part of it. 
[00:43:30]  And the amplification of that little room, it sounded like Pat from Wynaki throwing up his eggnog.  We're in the aisle, and you could hear, I mean, everyone was listening.  Loud and clear.  Gurgling.  Gurgling.  Gurgling.  Gurgling.  Yeah.  That's what it sounded like.  But more strain to it.  Like, that's just running out.  She was doing the whole, where, you know, our head was just turning red. 
[00:44:00]  Well, the waitress, she was, like, holding the thing.  Yeah.  And she was, you could tell, she started holding her, like, nose in her mouth, and she was,  you could tell she was getting sick.  Oh, you know a good Mardi Gras puke has to stink to high health.  Ugh.  Why'd you take a puke bag?  They had them right there in the thing.  No, no.  Probably filled it up.  No, this girl was puking.  This was another power booter.  I mean, this, that little bag wasn't going to do the job.  Nope.  No way.  She needed a turlet.  And I got to tell you, it got to the point where I do believe there was going to be a chain reaction, 
[00:44:30]  and other people were going to start puking, because it was getting close, man.  Oh, thank God.  Because the smell was starting to waft through where we were, and most of the plane was filled  with, you know, hungover folks.  Yep.  Thank God that door opened.  Made my way out.  And then, because the bathroom door was open still, the pilot couldn't get out.  He went to open the door to get out of the, off the flight deck, and the bathroom door  was blocking his exit.  So, here's a guy, spends, you know, three hours flying that two-ton plane into the airport, 
[00:45:00]  and he can't even leave, because some rookie is puking in the bathroom.  All this guy wants to do is fill out his paperwork, get into his 30-ounce car, and go home.  You've got to wait until everyone gets off the plane, then he can fold it up, put it  in his briefcase, and leave.  You know the beauty of it, though?  I would guarantee that 25% of our listeners went with it and had no idea that a plane  might weigh a little more than two tons, okay? 
[00:45:30]  I just want to acknowledge that.  All right?  There's a bunch of dummies that went with it.  A fully loaded 737-900 weighs 174,200 pounds, or 87.1 tons.  Well, I said 500 tons.  Thank you, Chad.  I said 500 tons, you said that.  You were more off than I was.  Apparently, the pilot was flying Jupiter.  Dope, I am.  Jesus.  I just want to go on record and say that you were more off than I. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, but the difference between two tons and 87 tons.  Yeah, but you went to 500 tons.  No one knows what a ton really weighs, but you just know that your car is like three tons.  All right, I'm sorry.  87 tons?  I thought it would be heavier than that.  Apparently not.  Relatively speaking, light.  Yeah.  Just imagine the power.  737 isn't a very big passenger.  Just imagine the power that still just amazes me.  It certainly is amazing.  The whole flying thing. 
[00:46:30]  Having Pat on there might bring it up a few.  You know, tons extra.  500 if I'm on.  I'm a big guy.  Dennis in Jersey.  One toe less, though, so it was a little lighter.  Come on, diabetes.  All right.  By the way, you guys had a full airport.  I had nobody in the airport.  I literally had one person in front of me in security.  Really?  I don't know why.  I was on the flight before you because of the mix-up.  It was starting to get crud.  I guarantee by noon it was going to just be a complete nightmare at that airport.  They said early morning was brutal, too, so maybe I got lucky you guys went up. 
[00:47:00]  In between?  Yeah.  Right.  In between the rush.  Let's go to Dennis.  What's up, Dennis?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Great to hear you back on the radio.  I know, because we weren't on the radio the last few days.  What?  No, no.  I mean, you know, just in general.  You mean, like, it's great to have us back doing regular radio?  Yeah, just to hear.  I hated the shows in New Orleans.  Hated.  Opie.  Absolutely hated.  Oh.  Okay, Dennis, what's up?  My cousin is a flight attendant for American Airlines, and he met his life partner there on 
[00:47:30]  American Airlines, and they're both flight attendants, though.  Of course they are.  And the cool thing is, they're both really excited to go see little Jimmy Norton this  weekend at the Stress Factory Eaton Town on Route 35.  And you can get more information on that at www.eatabullet.com.  www.worldwidebat.com.  I'll leave the last one off.  Thanks, man.  I think it's 888-541-A-HA-HA.  That's where you can find out about this gay couple. 
[00:48:00]  Am I correct?  All right.  That was a great one.  I won't leave the last W off.  That's for wavings, you idiots.  I want one straight flight attendant to call in and tell me why he got into the profession.  Good luck.  We're not going to find one.  Ben from Jersey says, my sister's a flight attendant, but she's as fat as hell.  Weighs at least 25 pounds.  My asses.  All right.  Hold on.  This weight thing has taken on a life of its own.  Brian the Trucker.  Go ahead, Brian. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, how are you guys doing?  Good, Brian.  Yeah, I want to agree with Jimmy Norton about the weight of a plane.  I was kind of shocked, too, to know that it only weighs 87 tons.  An average tractor trailer weighed out legally is 40 tons, so that's half the weight of a plane.  That's crazy.  Yeah, well, a tractor trailer doesn't have to leave the ground.  It's true, too, but you figure the size and how many people are out of you, you wouldn't think, you know?  Yeah, I guess, I think that's, I'm going to, maybe 87 tons is right, but I'm going to think that's wrong.  I think that's wrong. 
[00:49:00]  I think it's wrong, too.  Hey, Jimmy, I got one thing for you.  Oh, that ain't going to work.  He didn't even wait.  737's not a big passenger plane, though.  But you see, figure, like 130 people with fuel and all that stuff.  Let's say 777.  Hey, Anthony.  That's big.  Valentine's Day right around the corner.  Oh, wait a minute.  What day are we up to?  Isn't it, like, the 10th?  I think Valentine's Day is Monday.  Monday.  Yes, it is.  For all you people that care out there. 
[00:49:30]  A lot of people care.  A lot of people have love for, maybe you're a flight attendant.  You're a guy, and you want to get your gal.  No?  Want to get your guy something?  Something nice?  Nice bear?  Hi.  I got you this for Valentine's Day, sweetie.  A bear's bear.  Thank you.  Yeah.  It's the Steve.  The disappointed father bear.  No, they don't like when we make up bears.

Mike, what's going on?  What's happening, sizzle dick?  I don't believe it.  What's up, Mike?  Yeah, I can't help it.  I'm a lesbian.  I love the ladies.  You're really a flight attendant.  Yes, I am.  And you're really straight.  Yes.  Is that amazing or what?  And how many gay guys do you see in your profession? 
[00:52:00]  Be honest.  No, I probably get hit on by more fags than...  It's like working at a flying gay bar.  Really?  Yeah.  But, hey, you know, it's a great job.  So, I mean, do you get...  I mean, when the pilots decide they're not going to bang the flight attendants, then you  get to try to work these chicks?  Uh, it takes some work.  Yeah, there's no doubt the pilots get all the pussies.  I don't know if I'm buying it. 
[00:52:30]  I'm not buying it.  He doesn't sound the part.  This is why they have the gay guys.  Yeah.  Because, you know, you don't want a guy like this serving you up there in your airplane.  The gay guy's nice.  It's all, you know, hey, anything else I could get you?  This guy's like, hey, how you doing?  Maybe I'll throw your girl once.  Right.  You know?  Attention to detail.  Yeah.  Sorry, guys.  All right, Mike, I'm not really buying it that that guy is a flight attendant, huh?  Yeah.  Why is Noah in here?  I don't know.  Maybe because he bought me an apple and I just bit into it and it should be fired by a Boston 
[00:53:00]  cop and a girl.  It's like a beanbag.  Oh, wow.  Look how bruised it is in the middle.  He is the worst at getting your apples.  Noah.  What is that?  I do apologize, but you couldn't tell from the outside that it...  Where's your count?  Feel it.  All right.  Yeah, Jimmy's not happy.  Feel it.  Oh, look at it.  Look at that.  Oh, it's brown on the...  Oh, stop spitting it out.  You should have made him stick his hand out and spit it out in his hand.  This is awful.  That is a brown... 
[00:53:30]  It's brown inside.  You got it from downstairs, right?  Yeah.  How about this?  Arabs bad.  No more from the Arab deli downstairs.  I agree.  Their food preparation stinks.  It's a separate...  They don't care about food because they're strapping bombs to themselves in 20 minutes.  Hope I don't get fired for that, MS Radio.  You know?  What?  What did MS Radio do?  Oh, no, no, no.  I'm just saying.  You know, it's just making me correct in there.  All right.  We can't support these delis anymore.  They're garbage.  That's why, by the way, can I...  That's why I love Starbucks, and I love these big companies that squash these little 
[00:54:00]  faggoty...  New World Order, I'm all for it.  Why?  Because the products are better.  Starbucks is expensive, but you know what?  When you buy food there, it's fresh.  When you buy coffee there, it's always freshly made.  I agree.  The coffee prices are getting out of control, though.  No, I know.  I don't care about the big loss.  It's ridiculous, and they just raised their prices again.  It's unbelievable.  By the way, I want to thank Noah for dressing normally today, because we don't have the  energy to deal with his faggoty ways today.  Not at all.  Allegedly. 
[00:54:30]  Allegedly.  No, it doesn't mean he's a faggoty.  He has faggoty ways, though.  I just don't want to be sued for a hostile work environment from human resources, like  an Asian girl who works at Hot 97 may be doing to somebody who was recently fired.  I mean, that's just the rumor.  Yeah, she's got a lawyer now, too, huh?  Of course she does.  Yeah, I guess the whole Tsunami morning crew...  Well, not the whole.  They're going back on the radio in a few days, and they're going to come back to huge exposure,  huge ratings, a lot of people checking them out.  Yep, they know how that works. 
[00:55:00]  And one of the Asian girls, well, the Asian girl, Miss Info that works on the morning  show, she's got a lawyer, and she's not sure she's going back because it's a hostile work  environment, and she might sue, and this and that.  That is just...  Where we sit, it's just amazing that this goes on at a radio station.  Sure, your stupid job or whatever with cubicles, I get it, but this is...  It shouldn't happen.  No.  It shouldn't happen at a radio station ever.  Sure.  Well, you remember when we were talking, we were listening to the tape, and it's just 
[00:55:30]  the way Miss Jones and Todd were addressing her.  Again, she didn't want to be a part of that bit.  That's her prerogative.  But you just knew that she's an Asian woman.  You show me one Asian woman that has a funny bone in her body.  Maybe there's a couple out there.  Margaret Cho.  No, no, I'm not even being racist.  I don't mean being racist.  It's just I've never met a funny Asian woman.  No.  I'm not saying they're not beautiful, they're not good people, they're not smart.  I've never met one that made me laugh or that went with the type of humor that I would find  funny.  Okay.  And listening to her, I just don't want to be a part of that. 
[00:56:00]  You just knew this bitch is the type that will run human resources, and that's what she  did.  Yeah.  And by the way, let me...  A standing ovation for Opie and Anthony.  For every time the company suggests bringing a chick in here, you two spit on the contract  and say absolutely not.  There is no way a woman is fitting in this environment.  No, I know a lot of guys in this business that have just been...  I'm not kidding, more than one.  Let's just say a handful of guys that have been sued by their female co-hosts.  They come into this environment which is kind of... 
[00:56:30]  This is pretty much a locker room.  We're pretty much broadcasting conversation from a locker room, okay?  There you go.  And the women want to be involved with this.  Of course.  And so every morning show in America hires the stupid morning girl to do the news and  be kind of a sidekick.  And then all of a sudden, she hears something that finally she doesn't like, and she goes  running to human resources, and then there's sexual harassment charges brought on to the  male host of the radio program. 
[00:57:00]  Instead of just disliking...  There's been things I've said that you've disagreed with and vice versa.  It never occurred to me to run to human resources and bellyache about it because I didn't agree  with what you said.  But that's that little ace in the hole.  Well, I can't get my way, so I'll run to human resources and snivel.  And sue.  It just makes you want to vomit.  Human resources.  Everything that's wrong with entertainment.  Yeah, because there's going to be things that are said that if a woman was employed and 
[00:57:30]  in here on a daily basis during this show, there's going to be problems.  There's going to be problems.  And it might not even be during the time everybody's working.  But the second the woman quits the job or leaves, then it all comes out.  Sure.  Then all the laughing was fake because she was forced to, and all that she had to sit through  was putting her through hell, and she can't sleep now, and pain and suffering.  One of my best friends in the business had to deal with this for years after one of his 
[00:58:00]  female co-hosts left the show and sued for sexual harassment.  The nicest guy in the business had to deal with this for years.  Yeah.  For years.  It goes on forever.  And trust me, the guy did nothing.  And you're called sexist if you say that.  If you say you don't want a woman around when it comes to this type of a show, instead of  going, look, that chemistry won't work, instead of being honest about that, that's sexist  and that's not polite.  It's like, come on, you can't win.  If you have somebody and they're here, the show is going to suffer because they're going  to, oh, I did morning radio recently in a place. 
[00:58:30]  It was great.  The only downside was that there was a woman going, ha, ha, ha, like, you know, the mild  objection voice.  Sorry, I'm an edgy comic.  That's what I do.  Sorry.  All the brain surgeons that are in radio think that that's what a show needs.  That's why there's every show, there's a woman in there.  And they have told us for years, you know, some genius, some consultant, some boss has  always said, hey, maybe you could get a woman's point of view in on that.  No, it's never going to happen. 
[00:59:00]  No, thank you.  So, Dave in Jersey, what's up?  Come on, Dave.  Dave.  No.  Hey, by the way, a 747 can weigh up to 435 tons.  Okay, so I said 500 tons.  Very close.  I was thinking 767, 777, both bigger than 747, I believe, capacity-wise.  No.  No, I don't think so.  777 is, no?  No.  Ah!  Maybe fatter people fly on it.  All right, we're going to do our math and we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony show award for most disturbing phone call goes to donkey sausage. 
[00:59:30]  What phone?  Do me one favor.  What cuddles?  Why don't you get some whore into your studio and have her shit on the plate and put it in  the microwave and then have her roll around in the screaming donkey sausage, donkey sausage.  Raquel?  That would be me.  You want to shit on a plate for us?  Okay.  And then run around saying what?  Donkey sausage?  Donkey sausage.  Dude, Jimmy Dean's donkey sausage.  I can do that.  I can do that. 
[01:00:00]  Donkey sausage!  Donkey sausage!  Donkey sausage!  I like it.  There's something oddly attractive about that.  That's got to be a promo.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, nice.  10202.  The Opie and Anthony show.  I say, don't you know?  You say, you don't know.  I say.  Take me out.  I say, you don't know.  Don't move down low.  I say. 
[01:00:30]  Take me out.  Let's go right to the phones and talk to Jen in Jersey.  She wants to defend females, I guess.  Jen, what's going on?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey, Care Bear.  Hi, Angel.  Listen, not all girls are like that.  They're going to file sexual harassment suits and shit.  We know.  Here's the problem with your statement.  Not all chicks complain about sexual harassment.  I can't tell you.  I can't come up with one guy that has ever come up with a sexual harassment charge against a fellow employee. 
[01:01:00]  Not one.  I can't think of one.  This is a chick's problem.  One straight guy.  One straight guy, I guess.  Yeah, there you go.  Get a few.  You're McGreevy's assistant.  Governor's office, yeah.  That's true.  But, I mean, straight guys do not go running and yelling and screaming and sexual harassment ever, ever in the workplace.  I'm so lucky that the fucking girl is, like, hitting on him.  Yeah, I know you said, look, when you get someone, like, you listen to Miss Jones on the radio, that's the woman who's obviously, who you'd want on the radio. 
[01:01:30]  I mean, she's a ballsy.  She's not going to cry and file harassment.  That's the type of woman I like on the radio, is someone who's like Miss Jones.  And, you know, the reality is how these women dress around the workplace.  What is this?  Hold on a minute.  This could get ugly.  Hold on, Jen.  What happened?  There's a fight here already.  What happened?  Wait, wait.  This is the apple he gives me.  What is that?  That was the sticker.  That was the sticker?  Yeah.  So, how did you get the sticker off? 
[01:02:00]  I removed it.  How did you remove it?  Pulled it off?  You pulled the sticker off.  And a plug came out of it.  And there's a piece of apple missing.  It looks like somebody ripped the band-aid off and the scab is gone and there's an exposed wound.  How did an eighth of an inch of apple come off with the sticker?  I guess I'm just not good at pulling stickers off.  I don't know.  Not good at pulling stickers off.  I think you picked that out with your fingernails, didn't you?  There's no way apple comes out with the sticker. 
[01:02:30]  He dug his fingernail in.  Right.  And he pulled it and a piece of the apple came off.  Now, be honest.  Didn't that happen?  Maybe that happened when I was pulling it off.  I can't touch my food.  Now you can't eat it.  I can't have touch my food.  It's contaminated.  But I washed it after.  I don't care if you washed it after.  Tom Hanks bled in my apple.  Here you go.  Eat this, fella.  Another one in the garbage pile.  Now, what's that one?  What's that?  I don't know.  Eric had that one.  I just want a red, crispy apple.  Is that so hard? 
[01:03:00]  It is hard.  Here, there's a third apple.  I understand this might not be apple season, so it's a little harder to find.  Where'd you get the second one at, by the way?  Same place, but I complained this time.  Same place.  It's amazing to me.  30 seconds ago, I complained.  I'm sure they took you seriously, too, because Arab males would look at you and go,  this is a man to be taken seriously.  I heard you're a man to be taken seriously.  So I agreed to sit down and discuss Mealy Apples.  Oh, Mealy Apples is nickel and dimes.  Salud.  Noah.  Well, apparently they didn't take you seriously. 
[01:03:30]  Cut that apple in half that Noah just got from the same place, I guarantee.  It's just as bruised inside.  I hate them.  Take a look inside that apple.  They actually went down to the basement to get that one.  Yeah, that's where they keep the best apples, in the basement of an Arabic establishment.  Good idea.  That was fantastic.  Right next to the explosive belts.  I understand there's some in Mohammed Atta's bus locker in the Port Authority,  if you want to get some really delicious Macintosh apples.  They were getting plastic explosives in the middle of those apples in the basement,  but decided to sacrifice one for Jim Norton. 
[01:04:00]  We have the good ones downstairs, my friend.  Good apple, please.  Good apple, my friend.  Downstairs.  I told him it was rotten, so I said don't go there for food anymore.  How about this?  When someone says don't go there for food anymore, you don't go there for food anymore.  At least not for me.  Whatever these guys want, I can't have food from that place anymore.  Next one's going to be a grenade, pink and red.  Oh, my God.  And then he digs his fingernail and pulls. 
[01:04:30]  How does that happen?  I don't understand.  Dude, you lick horse asses.  I'm not saying there are no inconsistencies in this.  And a lousy leg.  Why?  I don't know.  All right.  I wouldn't.  You know something?  Would you want that in?  No.  If someone's picking their friggin' finger in the apple, no, I wouldn't need it either.  Why are you asking Howard Hughes?  All right, maybe that is a bad example.  I know it is.  I'm probably not the guy to ask about that.  But Danny, this is why I like Danny.  Whenever I get an apple, it's crispy.  Yeah.  And it's always in a little... 
[01:05:00]  Would you like Danny to go get you an apple?  Look at Danny smiling, beaming with pride over there that he satisfies Jimmy with his apple.  Because he really understands.  He knows what a crispy apple looks like.  I bet you know it only goes downstairs.  One of the guys downstairs must have juicy lips and a V abs like that little criminal we watched this weekend.  That's probably why he goes down there.  Do you want Danny to go get you an apple?  Well, someone's going for coffee.  Whoever's going for coffee, I would prefer them to get my apple.  But he can't touch it.  Who's this kid?  Oh, he's been here for a while. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, what's your name?  Travis.  Hey, Travis.  What's up?  Nice, guys.  Welcome aboard.  When did you start?  October or something?  January.  Oh, okay.  January.  About a month ago.  Wow.  Oh.  Don't go downstairs and get apples anymore.  They're awful and they're food stinks.  Where'd you get this one?  From the same place, but I complained.  Wow.  Way to get things done.  Don't go there anymore.  Where'd you go?  Same place, but I registered a complaint.  Really?  Did you ask to speak to the manager of the terrorist funneling operation? 
[01:06:00]  Did you?  Stupid.  I bet he shook his finger into the face of that gentleman.  That apple was mealy and I'd like another.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  I'm sure he pulled that apple out of his big, nasty, matted beard.  They went down and found the mealyest apple possible.  Here, faggot.  Alright, well. 
[01:06:30]  There goes another apple.  It just drives me nuts.  And the eggs, the same place we got the eggs from today.  Ope had his eggs and ate three of them and threw them out and I ate some of mine.  They're garbage.  Eggs, my friend.  We need to support American industry.  Not these Arab delis that are nothing more than a front funneling cash to terrorist organizations.  If Jimmy wants a good old American apple, he should buy it at a good old American store, staffed by Americans. 
[01:07:00]  Good luck finding that establishment.  Yes, and for that, he should drive to Iowa.  Because we know no store around here is owned by an American.  Because in New York, Whitey doesn't want to work that hard.  No.  Not at all.  So we have to deal with Arabs and their mealy apples. 
[01:07:30]  They're the worst.  Yeah.  Thank you.  The delis are awful.  They're just awful food people.  I'm not saying they don't run good businesses.  They're not hard workers.  Alright.  When it comes to food preparation, they're an abomination.  Because they eat with their fingers in the Middle East.  It's in a bowl and 50 people dig their hands in.  Yeah.  And just eat and talk in gibberish.  And they wipe with the same...  Of course they do the same hand.  I read that.  It's just awful.  What happened to the German guys that used to own the delicatessens? 
[01:08:00]  I remember growing up as a small child, and I believe it was East Northport, Opie.  And the corner deli, it was a German gentleman that worked in there.  And he was very proud of his product and everything he put into it.  He was there.  I mean, I don't remember ever going there.  It didn't matter what hour of the day it was.  He was there making everything.  Making the Pennsylvania Dutch potato salad. 
[01:08:30]  And when you asked for a ham and Swiss on a hero, it was sliced tissue paper thin and very fresh and nice.  And he'd hand it to you with a smile.  So what?  The little bag had a swastik on it.  You'd get over things like that if your food's good.  Is that what it said?  This was Mengele's favorite place to eat before he was chased to Austria in 1948.  So what?  He'd leave his store, lock the doors, and throw rocks through Jewish businesses on the same strip mall. 
[01:09:00]  Kristolmach.  But the food was fresh and the apples were crisp.  As I remember it in a small boy in Warsaw.  That's great.  Detroit auto-worker.  I had Ivan Demjeniuk was the name I was, I remember.  Right, right.  There you go.  Of course.  But I couldn't get Detroit auto-worker.  And a Detroit auto-worker named Ivan Demjeniuk.  Ah, did you see that jerk? 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  Ah!  What a looker.  All right, listen.  We were talking about sexual harassment.  We were.  And we were talking about how only women file sexual harassment complaints.  What happened?  Pat from Monaki.  And his lampshade had fingerprints on it.  All lampshades have fingerprints on them, stupid.  Because we touched them.  No, if it's his toe prints, it'd only be nine. 
[01:10:00]  Time to be fair.  Eh, eh, eh, handprints in it.  High sugar.  What did that mean?  His lampshade had fingerprints on it.  I guess it was made out of a hand, skinned hand.  And that's probably what Pat from Monaki meant.  How about this, stupid from Monaki?  And his lampshade had fingernails in it.  That would have more implied that there was a hand, fingerprints on it.  Like yours doesn't, because it was never touched by human hands.  Lampshade had eyelashes.  Something like that.  Yes.  A little more.  Well, I tried to.  Yeah, lampshade had a tattoo on it. 
[01:10:30]  That might more imply that it's skinned.  Oh, that's very good.  Too short.  But apparently this idiot.  No, the lampshade had a light bulb in it.  Ah, did you see that jerk?  Oh, Pat.  You are the best, Pat.  What an ass.  What do I know?  Lampshade's out of the lamp.  His shoes had gold fillings.  What? 
[01:11:00]  I figured it'd be a gold.  True.  Stupid macadamia in the toes.  Falling off left and right.  Can't even wear flip-flops because he comes home with six toes.  That's why he has to wear shoes.  So if one falls off, he knows where it is.  Creep.  Oh, that's an awful image.  Guy loses toes like Bob Kelly loses cigarette lighters.  Fool.  Oh, wow.  That's funny.  All right.  We found a guy that filed a sexual harassment complaint against a woman. 
[01:11:30]  Jim, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  You tell us.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hello.  How are you?  Pretty good.  Well, probably the only guy that you know that actually had to file a harassment suit against  a female.  Against a female?  Yeah.  What happened?  Well, I was working in an insurance company a couple years ago, and, you know, this chick  kept talking to me and coming into my office, and, I mean, she was cute. 
[01:12:00]  I just wasn't into it because I don't do that with people I work with.  And she kept bugging me, kept sending me email, and, you know, kept following me to my car  when I was getting done work and going home, and I just, I asked her to stop.  She wouldn't stop, so finally I just went to HR.  And, of course, they turned it around on me, and, you know, of course, the HR representative  I spoke to was a female.  Wow.  Imagine that.  And she didn't believe me.  So, luckily, my friend happened to be one of the guards at the company, and I actually 
[01:12:30]  parked in the same exact spot every day because I knew there was a camera on that area of the  parking lot.  So, after I showed them the thousands of emails she sent me with no replies from me and the,  you know, footage of her showing up in my car every day, then they kind of believed me.  Here's the one question I have to ask.  How fat was she?  She wasn't fat at all. 
[01:13:00]  She was actually, I mean, like I said, she was nice.  She was cute.  I just, I don't do that with people I work with.  I did it a couple years before that.  Second question, when are you coming out of the closet?  Did you have a girlfriend?  Yes, I did.  Oh, okay.  And she was very upset by the whole thing.  So, you had a girlfriend?  So, that was a legit complaint.  It happens.  We know it happens.  We were kind of kidding before.  It happens.  And I'm sure a lot of the women, if not me, most of them that filed a sexual harassment  complaint, I'm sure a lot of them are legitimate.  Let me tell you something.  That isn't really a workplace sexual harassment thing.  That's more like stalking. 
[01:13:30]  That's a girl being a stalker.  That isn't a guy filing suit because a girl is going around telling off-color jokes.  Right.  Or a girl has a calendar up in her cubicle that offended you as a guy.  Right.  This is a girl that is stalking you that you probably could have called the cops and gotten  some result from.  I don't see this as one of these human resources girl goes because a guy is saying, you know,  hey, honey, or, you know, I like when you wear a short skirt to work, you got nice legs, 
[01:14:00]  something like that.  This is a stalking thing.  Your complaint was legitimate.  And again, I know probably a lot of the women's complaints are legitimate, too.  We're not saying that they're not.  It's amazing.  These women walk around the workplace with their cleavage showing, huge boobs, their legs  completely exposed, and we're not supposed to look.  Guys are so visual to begin with.  And you see this hot piece of ass walking around with half her tits showing, her tiny  little skirts, and we're not supposed to look.  Are you insane? 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  I mean, that's the equivalent of a guy walking around the office in a ball bag for the women.  You know what I mean?  Seriously.  Or with a half shirt so your abs are exposed.  You know what I mean?  Then maybe the women would understand what's going on here.  I mean, you guys come into work with, you know, the button all the way down, the blouse  and the boobs just sticking out.  Of course we're looking.  Yep.  And of course we're getting, you know, turned on by that.  And they're wearing it because they want you to look to a certain degree because there's  a certain power and control you can have.  Yeah.  And I don't mean any woman that wears a skirt wants you to look up, and I don't mean that. 
[01:15:00]  Well, you know when someone is dressing to be looked at, and yet when you look too much,  you're the guy with the mohawk.  What are you looking at?  Well, why are you like that if you don't need to look at all?  There was an instance at XM when we were all there, broadcasting from Washington, where  a girl walked by, and Jimmy gave her the up and down to her back, by the way.  She wasn't looking, but gave her, you know, the old heel-to-head look that everyone does  when a girl walks by.  And in this case, I think it was more so that, oh my God, how can an ass get that big? 
[01:15:30]  It was more of that look than it was, you know, look at what a hot chick that is.  But if a girl walks by, and she's hot, and you give her the up and down, and she sees  you, she can nail you for sexual harassment because you're somehow looking at her from  head to toe, and it's like oogling or something.  Then women should have to cover up completely.  There you go.  I don't want to see that, obviously.  You know, I want to see some skin exposed, but if they don't want to be harassed, then 
[01:16:00]  they shouldn't be wearing the short skirts.  Dike wear.  Wear dike wear.  Exactly.  Cover yourself up from chin to toes, and that's it.  Because, you know, that's something.  Turtle necks for all women.  Yeah.  Because, guys, it's an instinctive, like, reaction.  If a girl comes quickly around a corner or something like that, you don't have time to  think about it, you're going to look at her and do that up and down thing.  And it could get you thrown out.  Our job as guys, as much as they want to make it all nice in society, is to grab you 
[01:16:30]  by the hair and drag you into a cave.  Wow.  All the way back to the stomach.  But that's the reality of it.  It's in our blood to spread seed.  Okay?  You don't have the club you hit her over the head with?  It's our, that's what we think all day long, is to spread our seed.  Our seed.  And that's all we're thinking.  Mm-hmm.  We want to drag you into a closet and spread seed.  Into the copy room.  Are you insane?  You can make it all nice. 
[01:17:00]  Society can try to, you know, make it all nice for everybody.  But that's the reality of it.  We're still animals, and we just want to spread seed.  Yeah.  When I looked at that girl, Eric Logan was right there.  And Logan goes, dude, boy, you'd be getting a sexual harassment suit if you were down here  for a while.  And they said it's for mentally undressing someone.  Mentally undressing.  Right.  Right.  Like, it's almost like, mom, he's looking at me.  How do you know what a look is?  Yeah.  Don't look at me.  Meanwhile, if you're talking, you don't look up at her.  It was a hostile work environment.  He wouldn't even look at me when he talked.  Belly acres.  Shut up. 
[01:17:30]  All right.  This really makes for a great workplace.  Yeah, there's a couple things coming in here.  Let's go to Donnie in Island Park.  Donnie, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Yeah, it happened to me last year.  I had to file a sexual harassment suit against one of the bosses.  What?  We went away.  It was a whole bunch of us on a business trip.  That sounds hot already.  People drinking and everything.  Drinking, yeah.  She starts grabbing my ass, starts grabbing my balls and everything in front of everyone. 
[01:18:00]  Really?  She took this on for like three days.  We go by the pool and everything.  She starts touching, playing my nipples and everything.  So I don't say anything.  I'm not going to say anything.  I'm not like that.  Some guy complained to one of the bigger bosses and they called me up on the phone.  It was like a big deal.  Oh, bigger bosses.  Okay.  Yeah.  I thought you said something else.  So they put me on the spot.  So then I had to stay asking all these questions and everything and I said, yeah, she touched 
[01:18:30]  me and everything.  She touched me.  She touched me.  So then I had to go to HR and I had to, in all full details, what happened.  You know, I've never acknowledged that HR even exists.  They don't exist as far as I'm concerned.  I have never acknowledged.  Anthony and I worked for WNW and Infinity Broadcasting for six years before we did what we did.  I didn't even acknowledge the HR person.  I didn't even fill out the paperwork.  I said, nope, send it to our agent.  I will not even acknowledge that you exist.  Oh, it gets even better. 
[01:19:00]  Because I didn't get into radio to start, you know, hanging out in a regular, you know,  work environment.  The workplace.  She was married, too.  And she used to tell me sick things.  She used to be like, you know, I can't bang you because that's cheating on my husband,  but I could give you a blowjob.  Ooh.  Are they still hiring, by the way?  It's like a fine company.  No doubt, man.  You want our sympathy?  We're like, tell us more.  All right.  Thanks, Donnie.  No problem. 
[01:19:30]  Let's move on to Jen in Oklahoma.  Jen, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  How are you guys doing?  Doing good, Jen.  What's up?  Well, I used to work in a prison with my husband.  And when we first started working there, they said, be careful, like, when you change shifts,  don't give each other goodbye kisses or hugs.  Because right before we started working there, a lady actually filed sexual harassment charges on a couple who was telling each other goodbye after a shift change. 
[01:20:00]  A couple is saying goodbye to each other.  And another person, another party.  Yeah, a woman filed sexual harassment charges on a woman.  Basically, she was jealous because she had the hots for the guy.  And he was married.  And she couldn't hook up with him.  And this is in a prison, by the way.  Yeah.  Well, what's really funny about it is, like, a month later, the lady got fired because she got caught having sex with an inmate.  God, that sounds like it happens all the time. 
[01:20:30]  Screw the sexual harassment stuff.  I'm hearing that, like, inmates are banging the workers in the prisons all the time.  Prison sex.  What do you do?  Back that ass up to the bars?  Yep.  Oh, man.  How hot is that?  That's animalistic.  I watched six women get walked out of a prison.  I worked there for a year.  And six women got walked out for having sex with inmates.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right.  Thank you, Jen.  Desperate woman.  That is some desperation.  I don't know about that.  That's kind of like being a kid in a candy store.  I mean, if you're a woman and you see all these 3,000 guys, I mean, why wouldn't you pick one to... 
[01:21:00]  Probably big, fat asses backing up to those bars, though.  But the guys don't care, you know?  That's what I'm saying.  It's probably desperate women that can't just go out on their own and really pick up some...  I don't know if it's desperate.  It might be just their turn-on.  Now, that's the fantasy and the guy thinking that it's a turn-on.  I think it's some slobs.  It might be the girls like...  It might be her turn-on, man.  Yeah?  Yeah.  She might be able to get whoever she wants in the real world, but for some reason, this 
[01:21:30]  is just one of those things that just drives her nuts.  You'd like to think that.  I'm going to opt for the slob backing that sloppy ass up against those bars.  What do you think, Jimmy?  Mmm, crispy apple.  That's all he cares about.  Eric, by the way, gave me his apple.  Oh, he did.  Now, listen.  Oh, that's crispy.  Sounds a little soft over there.  No, that's so juicy that...  Wow.  Very good.  That it made it look kind of a...  But I registered a complaint. 
[01:22:00]  Oh.  They were going to throw me down and rape me in the yard, but I registered a complaint  with the guards.  He did say register a complaint, right?  What, do you have to fill out paperwork?  Yeah.  Ask him how he registered a complaint, because now I need to know.  As he picks the label off of your apple, leaving a divot.  Looks like it was up on Opie's sink all night.  Had little mouse bites in it.  By the way, no mice. 
[01:22:30]  No mice?  In the last 10 days or whatever it's been.  Noah, how did you register a complaint?  I didn't register a complaint.  I just complained that it was a rotten apple.  What did you say?  Give us it exactly like it was said in the same fashion you said it.  Why don't we do some acting here?  A little theater, improvisational theater.  Do we have one of those apples?  Do we have something that could be a stand-in for an apple?  Check the garbage.  There's a few in there.  One of the ones that isn't broken.  Okay, there's the bad apple.  All right, let's say that.  Anthony is the guy behind the counter. 
[01:23:00]  Yes.  Here, come in the studio.  Make believe you're coming in.  All right.  All right?  So here comes Noah.  I'm at the register.  Who dressed normally today, by the way.  Thank God.  Yes, Akbar.  We will blow up the embassy at a...  Oh, yes, a customer.  Yes, my friend.  I just bought an apple from your store.  Yes, good apple, my friend.  Yes.  And it was rotten.  I was wondering if you have any other better ones.  Rotten apple?  Get faggot.  Get out of my store.  That's all you did? 
[01:23:30]  You said there's a rotten apple, so you didn't say, excuse me, you're selling rotten apples?  I said I just bought a rotten apple.  I just bought a rotten apple.  From your store.  Do you have any fresh ones?  Did you say that you didn't want that one rotten apple to spoil the whole bunch?  Idiot.  Hey, so what you basically did, I said, I'd like to register a complaint.  You gave me a rotten apple.  How about handing me another one so I can dig my fingernails into it and then hand it to someone and they can eat it?  Thank you.  That's a fantastic system. 
[01:24:00]  Wait, there's a fly in my soup.  All right, well, here's a dead vermin.  Here, enjoy.  You really know how to get things done, customer service.  Maven, you are.  Yeah, you're not really, um, you're not scoring any points with Jimmy there.  Oh, I just want my apples to be, where do you get your apples from, Eric?  Costco.  Where's Costco?  All right, so they do exist.  There are the crispy apples that can be bought.  Mm-hmm.  Just apparently the downstairs doesn't have the apples.  All right, why don't we take a break?  All right.  Speaking of sexual harassment, this little thing we like to play from time to time.  You hear about sexual harassment on TV, and it makes the headlines in newspapers. 
[01:24:30]  As an employee, what do you need to know about it?  First, sexual harassment is against the law, and it's against your company's policy.  So what is sexual harassment?  Linda, you are doing a fine job here.  Oh, well, thank you, Steve.  But you know, you might try dressing a little sexier at work.  I'm sorry?  I mean, we're talking about your job here. 
[01:25:00]  There may be physical harassment.  Wow.  You're really tense today, Nancy.  Ow.  Bill.  Sorry.  You looked really tense.  No, I really don't like it when you do that.  Can you please stop?  I'll never stop, Nancy.  Never.  In some instances, the harassment may be verbal.  Word around the office is you've got a fat cock. 
[01:25:30]  Yes, I do.  I've got a fat cock, too.  Maybe we should rub our fat cocks together sometime.  Maybe a little oil.  Two fat cocks.  Together.  Oil.  It might be visual harassment, such as derogatory posters, cartoons, or drawings.  Sexual harassment is not always about sex.  It may be the result of a power struggle between a manager and a subordinate. 
[01:26:00]  Man.  I could go for a power fuck right now.  Change is slow, and what was acceptable in common behavior years ago can now be sexual harassment.  Smells like vagina in here.  Excuse me?  Smells like fresh vagina in here.  Are you talking about my vagina?  Maybe.  Everyone wants to be treated fairly and with respect. 
[01:26:30]  Treat your co-workers with the courtesy and respect that you want for yourself.  It's your company's policy, and it's the law.  From O&A Pictures comes a true story of one man's pain.  It does hurt.  And a family torn apart.  And it makes you feel really funny right after it happens.  The War of the Kumias.  I had the yelling parents, too, growing up.  Until they got divorced, it was just, you know.  And then you'd see, like, the old man would take the plate full of spaghetti and throw it. 
[01:27:00]  And it would hit, like, the wall next to the phone.  And you're sitting there horrified watching the spaghetti slowly go down the wall.  Fuck you!  Get the fuck out of the wall!  Fuck you!  Oh, and the horrified kids.  Did Dad actually leave after the fights?  Yeah, a lot of times, sure.  And then, you know, you'd be able to go to sleep.  Because the yelling would stop.  First, Mom would have to wind down a little.  That fucking asshole!  You know, even after Dad left, she's still going.  Eat that shit like I need a fucking hole in the head!  I'm trying to sleep! 
[01:27:30]  He's gone!  Shut up!  Come in here!  Shut up!  That way!  Is that good?  Oh, God, he's been gone a half hour.  When would he come back?  Shut up.  The next day?  Yeah, like the next day.  You know, they'd be sitting down watching, like, Ronan Martin's laughing.  Laughing.  Everything was fine.  You know, and then out of nowhere, you'd hear the rumbling.  You'd be in bed, and you'd hear, like...  But it's time for son, Father!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  And then you'd hear from the kids, like...  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  The fucking time! 
[01:28:00]  Oh, my God!  Can't you two just shut the fuck up for, like, one night?  And then we were pretty young, so, you know, we got, you know, called into the room,  and Mom sits down and goes,  Me and your father, I want you to know, and I want you to know it has nothing to do with you,  we're divorced.  Oh, okay!  Could I go out and play now?  How is this going to change my life?  Does this mean I don't have to listen to...  Oh, it does?  Okay.  So it's a good thing.  Great.  Well, thank you for staying together for so long and really, like, torturing us. 
[01:28:30]  You couldn't have pulled this one, like, five years ago?  Yeah, fucking asshole!  Well, maybe we couldn't remember as much and didn't have to listen to the yelling and screaming.  Go away!  Is that the...  Here's an idea, Pop.  There you go.  Right back into the Huntington boat ramp.  Give that a whirl.  The War of the Kuias.  You've got to figure you're going to just sit there disgusted having to listen to this crap.  And we're back with the O.B. and Anthony Pro. 
[01:29:00]  There's so much to do and we haven't done anything yet. 
[01:29:30]  Nothing.  We've had some interesting chats.  No, I know.  It's been a lot of fun, but I guess that's a sign that we're having a good radio show.  Yeah.  So I'm looking at the front page of the New York Post.  Yeah.  It's a paper, I guess, in New York.  It's a tabloid, really.  Yeah.  It's not much better than, like, National Enquirer or...  Weekly World News.  Or Weekly World News.  Because, you know, what do you...  Let me just... 
[01:30:00]  Well, you already know, but...  What do you think the headline should be today?  The front page of the paper.  Front page of the paper today.  What's the big news story?  Like, you wake up, you go to your corner store or wherever you get your newspaper, what do  you expect to see as the big story today?  Now that you've been awake a while and you've seen what's going on on TV and things like  that.  Big national story, maybe?  Just, I don't know, Iran's nuclear program?  I don't know.  That's kind of a big one.  Well, I was thinking on the same lines as you, North Korea announces it has nuclear weapons. 
[01:30:30]  They're finally admitting that they do have nuclear weapons.  I think that would be something that maybe people should need to know.  Sure.  Right?  Sure.  If you want to go with something that's worldwide and interesting to people, maybe the fact  that Prince Charles is marrying some hag.  Yeah.  Marrying his old hag there.  Ugh.  But no, the New York Post has mystery pop star wigs out. 
[01:31:00]  They're the worst.  Mystery pop star wigs out.  This is a big day for news.  There's just a lot of stories in the paper.  I mean, they found a lady dead in a water tank.  Water treatment.  Maybe that should be the front page of the New York paper, considering that a lot of people  in Jersey are drinking water today.  And maybe they should know that, you know, where they're getting their water from.  There was a dead lady there.  But no.  Mystery pop star wigs out.  And it's a picture of, obviously, Britney Spears, but they're trying to say it's a mystery 
[01:31:30]  pop star.  And the wigging out part is the fact that she was just wearing a short brown wig.  That's it.  They got pictures of her walking a beach with a short brown wig.  That's it.  That's the big story, according to the New York Post today.  Mystery pop star wigs out.  We don't need to talk about that North Korea has all these nuclear weapons and they're out  of their effing minds over there.  What we might do about it as a country.  We don't need to talk about Iran and what they're doing behind our backs. 
[01:32:00]  No.  Everyone wants to know that Britney Spears is walking around in a short brown wig, everybody.  The fact that after some short diplomacy, we'll probably launch a preemptive strike against  some of their nuclear bomb-making facilities.  That'll be nice.  Let's get a nice...  Let's get an 18-fronted war going in the Middle East.  And now we got Joe from New Jersey.  He has the headline, by the way.  Go ahead, Joe. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, I got a different post than you guys got because I got nukes.  Wow.  Your phone just effed up your great line.  You screwed up your joke, my friend.  Well, just say it again.  No one heard it.  No.  He was going to say, the post line says, gooks got nukes.  Gooks got nukes.  But just as he was saying gooks, his phone went...  That would be the post's headline.  No.  No, it wouldn't.  They get silly, but they don't get racist. 
[01:33:00]  Ah, well, I don't know.  So what do you think of Prince Charles marrying that old hag that he's been hanging out with  forever?  I don't know why he's bothering getting married again.  Is there any reason, any royal reason for him to get married?  I know sometimes these guys are forced into marriages.  Sometimes it's to prove they're not gay.  Sometimes it's, you know, to have kids, like he did with Diane.  It was one of those things.  You know, he just needed to have an heir.  But why is he getting married now?  There has to be a reason. 
[01:33:30]  He's not just doing...  He's the prince, you know?  Mm-hmm.  And why is he marrying her?  Well, he wants to make it official.  He's been hanging out with her his whole life.  But do you think it's family pressure?  Like, oh, you better wed this woman.  We can't have you seen walking around without a wedlock.  Mm-hmm.  Something like that.  Because this guy doesn't want to be married.  He never did.  I can't see him wanting to now.  Well, you were saying in the office that he's gay.  A lot of rumor and speculation over the years that he was gay. 
[01:34:00]  And that might be the reason he's getting remarried again.  You know, he married Diana to have kids with her.  I don't necessarily disagree with you.  Because, yeah, all right.  Because you look at Lady Di and then what's her name?  Princess Bowles?  I've been calling her Diana because I don't want to say Lady Di.  Ugh.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Conjure that nasty image.  Well, Lady Diana.  Yes, Lady Diana.  And the old hag he's marrying, that's Camilla Parker Bowles.  Bowles or something like that.  Bowles.  Camilla Parker Bowles. 
[01:34:30]  What's her name?  That English whore.  Camilla Parker Bowles.  You're not thinking that he's thinking beauty's on the inside because, I mean, come on.  You look at the two and he really wanted the Camille chick all along.  Yeah.  But he had the kids with Lady Diana, right?  She probably, she's good at something.  Maybe cleaning the house, maybe taking care of them.  Maybe she gives a mean BJ.  I don't know.  The ugly ones and the fat chicks try a little harder. 
[01:35:00]  Try a little harder, perhaps.  Maybe that's it.  But, no, maybe it's, you know, family pressure saying, you know, you can't just waltz around with this broad.  So he's hooking up.  God bless him.  Have fun.  But, you know, you're the prince over there.  He could probably get some really nice chippy or something and he, hey, hey, look at us.  Perhaps it's love.  And he chooses the ugliest woman in the kingdom.  Yeah.  Well.  His son will show up to the wedding with a little Nazi uniform on. 
[01:35:30]  Well, Anthony, speaking of.  In a little salute.  Speaking of weddings, where's the Dunkin' Donuts story?  Love comes in all sides, though.  It sure does.  Oh, brother.  Throw crawlers, not rice.  Oh, throw crawlers, not rice.  Oh, ho.  Wedding at Dunkin' Donuts, everybody.  Come on, get married.  Throw crawlers.  When John Townsend.  Throw toes.  When John Townsend marries Michelle Sarayo this morning to get married, Anthony. 
[01:36:00]  Oh.  She'll have her choice of rings, plain chocolate or vanilla, without sprinkles.  Oh, did you see that, George?  God, I think I can tell you.  The Daily News, they have the best comedy writers.  Engagement ring, wedding ring, and the suffer ring. 
[01:36:30]  Three rings.  Oh, boy.  They're just terrific, aren't they?  Oh, they're the best.  Oh, boy.  The New Jersey sweethearts are planning to have a coffee and nuptials ceremony outside of Dunkin' Donuts in Hackensack.  Ah, that's...  Courtesy of the pastry chain, which has thrown in a free honeymoon in the Bahamas.  How much attention do you need that you have to get married at Dunkin' Donuts?  Married at Dunkin' Donuts.  They won a best proposal story contest held by the Donut Dynasty. 
[01:37:00]  Ah!  What's their best proposal story?  On the second anniversary of their meeting last October, Townsend gave Cererio three boxes,  each with a photo representing their past, present, and future.  The last box contained a picture of him holding a Will You Marry Me banner.  Ugh!  That was the best one they could come up with?  I wish there was a picture in a fourth box of both of them being killed in a drunk driving wreck. 
[01:37:30]  What about driving up to Massachusetts in a Volkswagen with no heat?  That's a good proposal story.  With an $80 ring.  And tears in your eyes.  From Penn Station.  With that win.  With tears in your eyes, knowing it's just not going to get any better than this, so I might as well.  Three photos, past, present, and me forking over hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Me happy, me sad, me broke. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  We got married at the Jack Daniels facility.  We're pretty non-traditional, says the bride.  I get married by Elvis in Vegas.  If by non-traditional, they mean fat.  So a pink and orange wedding is no problem.  Are they fat, nope?  Of course they are.  They're huge.  They're just Dunkin' Donuts.  She's...  You know how fat she is?  She's wearing black, and you can see her belly.  Yep.  Black is supposed to cover a world of hurt. 
[01:38:30]  In this picture, which is a black and white photo, and she's wearing a black, long T-shirt  with another shirt over it.  Yeah.  You can see her belly through the black.  Look at that.  That's fat.  Anyway, we can get these fat pigs on the phone.  They're probably...  Should we try to get them on the phone?  They're probably faithful listeners on the program.  Big fan Jersey.  From what I know, everyone in Jersey listens to this show.  Yeah, everyone in Jersey listens, and...  Even a monarchy.  And what else are they going to do but listen to this awful program and get their daily dose 
[01:39:00]  of humor?  Now they're going to go home and get to work on making some munchkins.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Oh, boy.  After their wedding night, her back's going to look like a Boston cream donut inside.  That's terrific.  Oh, sorry.  Not tonight, dear.  I'm jelly. 
[01:39:30]  Or maybe...  I hope he doesn't have a warts.  She'll go, one of those will go, ah, they're just flesh-colored sprinkles.  It'd be good, all people waiting out in front to throw hot coffee in their face as they  walk out.  Oh, my God.  This story just gets more and more awful.  Well, she also liked the idea of staying properly caffeinated for the big event, particularly  since she knew she'd be up into the wee hours of the morning to primp up for the big occasion. 
[01:40:00]  Taking some good Dunkin' Donuts coffee dumps out of the fat ass.  Sorry, dear.  Do they say where they met?  Was it at a Dunkin' Donuts?  Is that why they're doing this?  I think of a thousand other places to get married than a Dunkin' Donuts.  Absolutely.  I'd rather get married to a deli downstairs.  And at the end, instead of, like, rice, they could throw Millie apples at me and my wife. 
[01:40:30]  Congratulations, my friend.  It's going to be a pink and orange wedding, and they got, like, these pink lights.  So, one thing people don't realize is that pink lighting is key.  It makes everyone look young.  And another cool thing is that you'll definitely find munchkins among the flowers.  What a romantic, lovely story, that is.  I wish them the best.  Is someone looking them up? 
[01:41:00]  Oh, cool.  Okay.  Nothing else there.  Bahamas?  Yeah, then they get the honeymoon in the Bahamas.  Poor bastard's got to sit in the flight between those two.  Can we get to a hot story?  Why do you want to send two big, fat slobs down to a beach area?  Yeah, isn't that great?  How about, like, Juneau, Alaska?  You know, Moscow?  Bundle up Siberia.  The back half of the moon.  Congratulations.  Stand here and finally fit in, you planetary monstrosities. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, God damn, that's good.  You want a hot story?  Yeah, well, I'm trying to find my hot teen news.  Oh, yeah.  Intro.  We haven't done hot teen news in a while.  Forgot about that.  Opie and Anthony's Hot Teen News.  Ah, Anthony, a story everybody's talking about today.  Elementary teacher accused of having sex with boy 13.  An elementary school teacher has been charged with having sex with one of her students, 
[01:42:00]  a 13-year-old boy, at his home and at school.  You will be molested.  Pamela Turner, 27, was charged Monday with 15 counts of sexual battery by an authority figure  and 13 counts of statutory rape for acts between November and January.  Turner, who teaches physical education at the elementary school, lived at the boy's house  for a brief period of time when she was moving.  She lived there?  Yeah.  She lived at the house?  When she was moving from residence to residence. 
[01:42:30]  Yes, Anthony.  That's great.  Parents will have that guilt now that they let her in.  The boy's parents did not know anything about the relationship.  She could get up to 100 years in prison for this, Anthony.  100 years?  What'd she do?  She's free in lieu of a $50,000 bond.  Time of your life, kid.  Turner's husband filed for divorce in January, alleging inappropriate marital conduct.  So there you go. 
[01:43:00]  I saw a picture of this lady.  Wow.  Yeah, she's a hottie.  Let me tell you something.  If I was 13, and that was my teacher, and she was molesting me, I'd have no problem with it.  It's one of those...  Absolutely no problem with it.  Dude, how many boners were you getting at 13?  One continuous one.  Over and over again.  You got this?  Making moves on you?  I'm looking at...  Here's the one from, like, last year.  Deborah LaFave.  Remember her?  Yeah.  Look at her. 
[01:43:30]  She's got the blonde hair, blue eyes.  She's cute.  Very hot.  She's one from last year.  Again, banging some kid who was a 14-year-old.  She was 24.  Very hot.  Now we got this one.  Look at her.  She's got that blonde hair.  She's another hottie.  She's beautiful.  How about the sexy one that was having, like, hooked up with the 8-year-old black kid from  Long Island or wherever?  Oh, yeah, another one.  She was a cute blonde, too.  Yeah.  There's something going on there.  See, you know, sex with an 8-year-old. 
[01:44:00]  Awful, obviously.  Never.  You're not getting around that one.  Well, awful.  But, I mean, I remember being 13.  It was all about just popping boners.  You know, the wind blew.  You're popping a boner, and you've got this hot 27-year-old teacher...  Living at your house.  ...living at your house, and something's going on.  I'm not going to be scarred for life.  I'm just not.  I've had that happen.  The parents went out one night.  You know, she's there watching the 13-year-old.  That happened?  A couple of drinks, maybe.  Don't tell your parents. 
[01:44:30]  Ooh.  A little, uh, watching the movie.  Get a little close on the couch, maybe.  She puts her hand over.  Starts rubbing.  Uh-oh.  Now there's trouble.  Grabs on.  Boing.  It's over.  These things never last long, either.  You ever notice?  They had sex from, like, November to January?  Because they can never keep it under wraps.  No, the kid can't.  The kid can't, of course.  He's going out telling everybody.  Telling everyone.  I remember being, like, 12, 13, and I was at my grandma's beach house at, uh... 
[01:45:00]  Uh-oh.  No, nothing bad.  I don't know.  But it's kind of similar.  It's, uh, you know, a little beach house where the family went and stuff,  and my Uncle Tommy was, uh, about, I guess, 10 to 12 years older than me or whatever.  Uh-oh.  This is sounding bad.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I don't even know where it's going.  No, but he was a big partier, and he always had chicks around and this and that.  I'm just a scrawny 13-year-old, and I had a crush on one of his, you know, friends.  Yeah.  You know, at the time, I thought she was a hot piece of ass. 
[01:45:30]  I'd love to see a picture now.  Maybe she wasn't.  And thinking the whole time, I have a shot.  And I'm 13.  She had to be 23 to 25 years old.  Really?  I would have easily had no problem with that.  Yeah, at that age, you just, you're all full of hormones, just raging.  There was this guy in California named Jimmy Jackson, and he had a wife named Patty,  and he was going out one day, and I guess she was about 25 years old when I was 13, around that age.  And, uh, he was going to a horse auction up in Chino, California. 
[01:46:00]  So, uh, he leaves, drives away, and I'm there running the rent string.  I was, uh, the wrangler, Opie.  The wrangler.  I had to wrangle the horses.  So, so he left, but I didn't know this.  He had gone down the road, walked back up, gone into the bedroom, uh, closet.  Now, I went back into the house, and now Patty, I hear from the bedroom, going, uh, uh, Anthony,  could you come in here?  And I'm like, that's a little odd.  So I go in, and Patty is sitting there, um, nude, uh, with the, the sheets pulled up, 
[01:46:30]  um, and her breasts exposed.  That, that was buzz.  I know, it's a very similar story.  But, uh, she goes, why don't you come in?  And I'm like, no, because I knew Jimmy.  He's like a madman.  Guns all over the place and stuff.  Uh, I didn't, I'm not going to say I didn't think about it, you know?  But, uh, I, I actually had to restrain and say, no, I, I can't, and I'm not.  And, uh, it's a good thing I didn't, because it was all a big joke.  Jimmy was in the closet with a shotgun, and, uh, he bust out of it, and he was like, what 
[01:47:00]  are you doing in the bedroom with my wife?  But the joke didn't play out, because I, I didn't go along with it.  Uh, but, and if I did, I would have crapped myself all over that bed.  Just crapped myself.  But they were just trying to get you.  They were trying to get you.  That is sick and twisted.  Oh, it's stuff that used to go on.  That's worse than, like, the Manson family.  Used to go on out there all the time.  This is the same guy that decided it would be funny to weld together one afternoon a Roman  chariot and hitch it up to a horse and ride it down Main Street.  The horse went crazy, ran between two parked cars. 
[01:47:30]  The chariot just stopped dead, and the horse ran, uh, right into a storefront.  You guys had the best drugs out there in California.  It was just, everybody was drunk and, uh, having sex and shooting guns out there.  That was pretty much what life was on a daily basis.  What a sick setup, if you're a kid.  I know.  She's in the bedroom naked, going, come in here, and the husband is waiting in the closet  with a shotgun to jump out and say, ha, ha, ha, we gotcha.  Another woman, uh, she had to be in her twenties also, this engine, a squaw. 
[01:48:00]  Uh, she invited me to come around back by where the hay was and take a roll in the hay  with her.  And her husband, who was there at the time also, drunk off his ass, he was like, remember,  remember the Indian in 48 hours that hung out with Gans?  Yeah, sure.  That crazy, and he looked and sounded just like him.  Billy Bob.  Billy Bob, yeah.  And had the big knife on him, too.  And all I could think of was, you know, this guy's just going to skin me alive if he caught  me.  So, again, I had to turn it down. 
[01:48:30]  But as a kid that age, to have to turn it down, to have to worry about your own safety,  to have to turn these things down, is crazy.  Insane.  Nuts.  That's nuts.  When we get back, can you tell the story of the dead horse?  Oh, yeah.  That's a quickie, sure.  That's a good little story, too.  Another Jimmy Jackson story.  Hey, Anthony, Valentine's Day right around the corner.  I guess it's Monday, huh?  Yes.  Okay, guys, it's Thursday, and Valentine's Day is on Monday.  Yeah, it says it right here.  Thank you.

This was supposed to be queued up.  You were talking about wedding proposals and stuff, so a little something-something as  we go to break here.  Oh, I thought this thing was queuing up again.  Queue.  Eric to the rescue, hitting it.  Is that what you did while we were gone?  Just hit the equipment? 
[01:50:30]  This is a brand new CD player.  They were all proud that was finally installed.  Remember?  Because we were bitching about the CD player.  Oh, good.  All right.  Bravo.  It's working well.  Ben, quick, smack your hog against it.  That's great.  Well.  Yeah.  Hey, why don't you bend over and fix that thing?  Yeah.  It is just weird.  This studio has gremlins like I've never seen before at a radio station.  Hold on.  Mars is here.  Yeah, Mars.  Maybe I... 
[01:51:00]  Mars.  Maybe it was my fault.  I don't know.  Maybe I placed the CD in the wrong way.  What did you do?  I don't know.  Snap it in half first.  Mars, just give me the word and I'll take care of the situation.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  All right.  There you go.  Oh, it came out?  Yeah, let's try it again.  Give it another try.  We forgot what we were talking about or segwaying into.  Oh.  Oh, Jesus.  Opie. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, well.  Jesus Christ.  Looks like we need another one.  What did you do?  CD player two.  Wait a minute.  Mars, you know that shouldn't have broke.  He slammed the thing shut, though.  Yeah, normally you should be able to close it with the heel of your foot and not have it  break.  Surprise.  That's delicate stuff, the CD door.  It's the little tray that slides out with the CD in it.  Well, we need another little tray.  Did the tray snap?  I can't see.  I can't believe you broke that 10-ton CD player.  All right. 
[01:52:00]  Wow.  Sorry, Mars.  You saw it, though, because I don't want Washington yelling at me.  Get your ass to Mars.  That shouldn't have broke.  You're getting married.  No, no.  Here's Anthony from the Oakley & Anthony Go to help you plan the perfect wedding.  I'm talking to you.  Are you listening?  First, you must carefully choose a wedding ring for your gal.  I went into one of those jewelry stores in Penn Station, and I think I spent, um, 300 bucks 
[01:52:30]  on it.  All right.  Well, you should also make sure your betrothed gets along with your dear, sweet mother.  Your f***ing son is a scumbag.  Eh, maybe not.  Your wedding night, on the other hand, should be a magical one.  I believe, uh, I laid there looking at the ceiling with tears of, of regret and sorrow rolling  down the sides of my face.  Just follow these simple steps, and you'll have the perfect wedding. 
[01:53:00]  Just like, and, eh, I got nothing.  I was shocked.  I was horrified.  I was broke.  Hopeless.  What did I get myself into?  It only took nine and a half years for me to leave.  Never marry a wife!  I was a broken, beaten man.  And I had been married for six hours.  State of the Union.  Gas prices going up again.  The Opiate Anthony Show on XM. 
[01:53:30]  Oh!  Who goes the weasel?  Ramon, give me your sleeve.  The Opiate Anthony Show, XM 202.  Hey, hey, hey! 
[01:54:00]  We're down with the fire!  Hey, hey!  We're down with the fire!  Still to come on the Opiate Anthony program, Starker Patty coming in to try out to be our,  uh, news person.  Great.  Oh, fantastic.  I guess she wrote up some stories and everything.  The Indian from 48 Hours is Billy Bear. 
[01:54:30]  Billy Bear.  Not as easy as Billy Bear Thornton, I think his name is.  Yeah, we were saying Billy Bob.  Thank you, fan dick from WackFact.  Chester wants to register a complaint.  Chester?  Go ahead, Chester.  Hello, Chester.  I've missed you so much.  Hi, guys.  What's going on?  The kick in the side.  What's up, Chester?  Uh, not a whole lot.  I, uh, got a little bit of a problem here.  I got two radios.  Yeah.  So I'm paying 14 cents a day for your guys' outstanding program. 
[01:55:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'll agree Mardi Gras kind of sucked, but it was funny anyways.  But, uh, okay, 14 cents a day and I gotta listen to advertisements.  Uh-oh.  On a paid service.  Oh, boy.  That's a little weird.  I, I, I gotta be honest with you.  It's a little strange.  I mean, if you guys were on a paid channel, I wouldn't have a problem with them.  Oh, you wouldn't?  No.  If we weren't on a paid channel and they played commercials, you wouldn't have a problem with that?  Oh, okay.  Cool.  Right. 
[01:55:30]  Remember you said that.  I can't see it.  It makes no sense to me.  I mean, we're paying for your channel.  We're paying to hear Obi and Anthony.  Yep.  Not.  We're paying for it.  You buy the teddy bear.  Well, there's nothing wrong with the Vermont teddy bears.  It's about my wife one last Christmas.  Oh, she loved it, right?  Yes, she did.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Chester.  I don't want to hear advertisements on a page.  Well, I'll tell you what happened, Chester.  I demanded more money or I was going to walk off the program and they said, what can we  do?  And they said, let's put a few commercials on.  The listeners should enjoy that. 
[01:56:00]  Pay for Jimmy Norton.  So you can blame Jimmy Norton.  You know what?  Jimmy's a bomb.  They're listening to you loud and clear down there in Washington.  So thanks for registering your complaint.  Yes.  All right.  A couple things.  Norton, the old guys got off.  Good.  The old guys?  Yeah, this is a great story.  Good gag rule.  Jury clears lawyer joke duo.  These two old curmudgeons from Long Island.  From Huntington, actually.  Ah, your hometown. 
[01:56:30]  This is great.  A couple of jokers from Long Island got the last laugh yesterday after a grand jury dismissed  charges they had caused a disturbance when they told lawyer jokes in front of an attorney.  This is great.  Harvey, 70, testified before the grand jury that he was expressing his First Amendment rights  when he shared a few choice judicial gags with his friend Carl.  Of course he was.  As they stood online last month waiting to get into the Nassau County Courthouse.  Basically, they're waiting to go through security and all that. 
[01:57:00]  And so, you know, they had something they had to deal with at the courthouse.  And the lawyers are all lined up as well.  Everyone just getting into the courthouse.  So they figured, ah, might as well tell some jokes.  Old guys love those one-liner jokes, man.  Oh, sure.  When I used to hang with my dad at the Legion there in Kings Park, they all were telling  their jokes.  Their cute little black jokes and Polish jokes.  And they didn't care.  Well, court officers claimed the two men had been abusive when they repeated an old courthouse  chestnut about the legal profession's propensity for fibbing. 
[01:57:30]  One of these old guys says, how do you tell when a lawyer is lying?  And obviously the answer is his lips are moving.  Ah, so they're just having a good old time as they're waiting to get into the courthouse  telling their lawyer jokes.  And after the guy told his joke, both of the old guys here started howling in unison.  So they're having just a good old time.  That's great.  It's written in the paper, his lips are moving, came the answer, and the pair howled in unison. 
[01:58:00]  Howled.  You know, they've been friends forever, and they're just, like, just entertaining each other.  Laughing and laughing.  By the way, these are the worst, hackiest jokes ever.  They're just awful.  The one guy said, how do you know when a lawyer calls you and says he's, like,  owe money for Girl Scout cookies and he's dodging you?  He's dodging me.  The two men, founders of Americans for Legal Reform, set a lawyer in line ahead of them,  told them to shut up and reported them to court officers.  Do they have that faggot lawyer's name? 
[01:58:30]  No.  Of course not.  And then the officer promptly arrested, too, for telling the joke.  Arrested them?  How do you arrest someone for telling a joke?  Is the officer's name in there?  Uh, no.  They don't have any of that.  What's the charge?  I don't, well, let me see.  Arrested them for telling a lawyer jokes.  I'd love to know what the charge is on that one.  Yeah, it doesn't say what the charge is in this one, but it says, I'm a free man, um,  said one of the guys here, the, uh...  Said Pat from Munaki? 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  A lawyer joke.  Thought it was funny.  We beat him, the First Amendment is alive and well.  Wow.  Just the fact that only in this country can that ridiculousness, uh, be an issue.  Yeah.  Litigious idiots we have turned into.  Harvey said he was unbowed by the hassle and vowed to continue.  Telling jokes online?  I'm going to keep telling those lawyer jokes 150%, he said.  Other zingers in the Carl and Harvey repertoire. 
[01:59:30]  What do you say to a lawyer with an IQ of 50?  What?  Good morning, Your Honor.  I get it.  He's the judge.  These guys are great.  Can we try to get these guys on the phone?  Maybe someone will try to produce the show today.  This is like obvious stuff.  You get a wacky story in the paper like this and they're from Long Island, you try to call  them up and get them on the show.  Maybe they'll do some zingers for us live on the air.  We got three guys producing the show behind the scenes.  This is the type of thing they need to do. 
[02:00:00]  I got it, one.  Yeah.  Why don't sharks bite lawyers when they fall in the ocean?  Why?  Professional courtesy.  Ah!  Uh-oh!  Oh, don't come get me, officer!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  That's terrific!  That's terrific!  These guys are a real hoot.  And what's the difference between a vulture and a lawyer? 
[02:00:30]  What?  Wing tips.  Hello!  Exactly!  Did they say that one of these old men was pelted in the skull on a little rascal in New  Orleans this weekend?  Ah!  The older gentleman.  You know who took this case for the old guys?  Ron Cooby.  Yeah, Cooby does a lot of that type of stuff.  Oh, God.  That ass.  But he was right in this case.  I mean, he should have taken the case.  I am.  And they learned that it's still legal to tell jokes in America.  So.  I would love to know what the prosecutor, the DA, which district attorneys, is there ever 
[02:01:00]  a point where you have any human dignity and you can say, no, I'm not prosecuting this?  I mean, maybe they're not allowed to say that.  Yeah.  I know.  What are you, crazy?  Why would we even pursue this?  Is there ever a moment where an assistant DA or somebody from the prosecutor's office  can just say, no, we're not going with this?  It's not business as usual.  God almighty.  It's a big assembly line, the whole legal system, you know?  There's no real, whenever you think maybe I have this outstanding thing or this piece  of evidence or some statement that's going to be like in the movies where you say it 
[02:01:30]  and all of a sudden people go, well, that's amazing.  It just doesn't happen that way.  It's all cookie cutter and you deal with people and no case is an individual.  They're all handled in this very, the same basic way.  You know?  Oh, we got something like this?  All right.  This is ridiculous.  Throw it out.  But for the most part, it's all just cookie cutter, cookie cutter justice.  This is great, though.  What a great visual.  Just two old guys telling the hacky jokes that they've been telling forever. 
[02:02:00]  Tearing it up online.  And then some young lawyer gets pissed off and gets them arrested.  Yeah, some young guy who had a dream about making a difference and he realizes he's not  going to make a difference.  Just one more jizz bag and a whole line of them.  Yeah.  Scum.  Let's go to the phones and say hi to John.  John, what's up?  Not much.  Hey, who started WOW?  Opie and Anthony.  Why?  Okay, because all these truck drivers up in New York and Boston, they're all telling  me that Stern started it. 
[02:02:30]  Stern started WOW?  That's right, wow.  Yeah.  You find me one article that says Howard Stern started Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Please.  I started WOW.  Wow.  Please find an article that says that.  Hey, I was getting ready to get rid of XM and I heard a clip of you guys and that's  the only reason I'm keeping it.  Oh, thank you.  I appreciate it, John.  But I was about to go over to Sirius, but you guys have kept me.  But hey, if there's one thing, can I ask you a favor? 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  If y'all, I know right now you probably don't want to do it, but if there's some time you  guys can go back and tell a story from your view of what happened, you know, the church  thing or whatever, I don't know.  I heard something on the news back when it happened, but I didn't really care.  I've told that a million times.  You're kidding, right?  That has to be a joke, you know?  It has to absolutely, it has to be a joke.  But we can't get away from that story.  Even Stern doesn't claim to have started WOW.  He would never even say that.  He actually came up with one of the most ridiculous things ever. 
[02:03:30]  First of all, that's the beauty of the internet.  Just Google Whip Him Out Wednesday and you'll get articles going all the way back to, I think,  I think we started in like 96, 95, probably 95, probably about 10 years ago we started  this phenomenon that is Whip Him Out Wednesday.  You see the WOW on the back of trucks and you see the WOW stickers and the homemade WOW and  it's something we started in 95 and we basically told the guys to put WOW in their car and it 
[02:04:00]  meant Whip Him Out Wednesday and if the girls felt like it, they would flash you and it works  like crazy all the time.  You know, when it works great is going to a concert when you're stuck in traffic.  Right.  With all the young, young fillies.  The beaches too.  And the beaches.  In the summer when you're going down to Robert Moses or something.  Oh, forget it.  So, it's such easy access when they pull their little bikini aside.  Daytona 500 is coming up soon.  There you go.  You're going to be stuck in some of that traffic.  Make sure you've got a WOW in your car.  You'll see.  You'll see.  It'll happen.  NASCAR.  NASCAR.  NASCAR.  So, this WOW thing becomes huge. 
[02:04:30]  Absolutely huge.  And then Howard, because he has to claim that he invented pretty much breathing.  Has to claim he did everything.  You know, it's the law of averages dictates that there's something out there that he didn't invent.  Right.  Something.  The telephone maybe.  I don't know.  Right?  The powered flight.  There's got to be something out there he didn't invent. 
[02:05:00]  Ask him if he invented penicillin and somehow, some way, he'll connect himself to the invention  of penicillin.  Penicillin.  I had some moldy bread, Robin.  We grew up very poor in Roosevelt.  Moldy bread.  I had an infection and I thought I'd just eat the moldy bread and the infection went away,  Robin.  So, I invented penicillin.  Oh, all mine.  Oh, shut up.  Jackass.  Vented everything.  People just used to stand, Robin.  They would stand. 
[02:05:30]  And I decided one day I was going to, because I'm a genius, Robin.  I decided I was going to put one foot in front of the other.  And then everyone copies.  Oh, they call it walking now.  But that was me.  I called it sterning.  His ego is so huge and big.  He has no idea how ridiculous he sounds now.  He absolutely believes himself.  That's why no one could tell him.  He's like, you know, there are crazy people out there that actually believe things.  And you cannot tell them different because they're insane. 
[02:06:00]  That's Howard.  He's completely insane and believes everything comes from the center of the universe.  And that center is Stern.  Right.  That's it.  So, we were getting a lot of attention for Whip Him Out Wednesday.  A lot of stories written about it.  And he don't like that.  Actually, a lot of bad stories written about it.  Yeah.  A lot of bad pieces on local TV stations.  And then he claims that he did something with a bandana back when he was, what, in Washington?  I don't, I, to this day, don't know what the hell he was talking about. 
[02:06:30]  Some kind of Rube Goldberg machine he had going with a bandana, a car antenna.  Was there a day involved?  I don't even know if breasts were involved.  Tie a bandana on your antenna, Robin, is what I told him.  What does that mean?  I don't know, but I invented that.  What?  What?  And then our Frisbee dogs were ripping me off because they all had them bandanas around their neck.  We caught Frisbee. 
[02:07:00]  What?  I don't care.  He's the biggest ass.  And somehow that got turned into his version of WoW and how he invented it somewhere back in the 50s.  Yeah, whatever.  What a tool.  He really is a tool.  Jimmy, say something.  I'm completely agreeing with you and listening, but I wasn't around when he said that.  No.  Yeah.  He said that he's an idiot.  He's under a porch somewhere, I'm sure. 
[02:07:30]  What?  What did Stern say?  Well, it was a Wednesday and he whipped it out, so.  Sean in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, man.  It's even worse than that.  A day after you play something like the Mini-Me, he's playing the Mini-Me soundbite from Surreal Life.  He's playing the reporter who falls out of the barrel of grapes.  Well, the thing with the sound clips, that's a little, you know, I would love to act like, yeah, hey, we did it first and then everyone heard our show and decided they needed the Mini-Me clip.  If you're in radio doing this and you see, like, Mini-Me doing what he did on Surreal Life and you're a radio guy, you're immediately calling your people going, oh, my God, get me that. 
[02:08:00]  You don't think about who played it first.  It's not like they made it.  They didn't go into a studio and record it, you know, as their own.  It's a sound clip.  Yeah, I would love to.  It's all for no credit at all.  I would love to jump on and say, yeah, that was our, but you know what?  I mean, a lot of radio shows are sent the same stuff.  It's just how you use it and bring it into your program that makes it a little more unique, I guess.  Yeah, but he's making it sound like he found it. 
[02:08:30]  He went out there and grasped it.  That's what he was doing.  Oh, no, that was the most obvious one ever.  The Mini-Me clip is the most obvious one ever.  Every radio station in America should be playing that if they call themselves a creative radio program.  It's so obvious how great that is.  It's it.  But it's the other ones that you find, you know, where you do work a little harder that no one else has, you know?  I got it.  Like this one.  I love this one. 
[02:09:00]  That one goes on forever.  Of course it does.  No one else is playing that.  No.  No one is playing this.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  What medication?  I hate this place.  I've been here for seven years.  Seven years.  Hello, exactly.  Yeah, no one's playing those clips.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  You will be molested. 
[02:09:30]  This is one of my favorites right here.  No one's ever going to play this one.  I think this is audio of Mardi Gras when those undesirables were messing with Whitey.  We got actual audio of Whitey, Anthony.  We do.  As they were getting harassed down there on Bourbon Street.  I'm scared of you.  I'm scared.  I'm scared of you, sir, and I'm protecting myself.  I am protecting myself.  I am scared of you.  Please call the police.  That's a great video clip. 
[02:10:00]  What a tool that guy is.  Is that up on Foundry Music?  Yeah.  It is?  That's great.  The guy's videotaping some guy.  It's a white guy.  He's videotaping a black guy walking into a convenience store because he's scared of him.  The guy came to return something, I guess, and he was under the impression of him.  He was harassing the clerk in some way.  So the guy grabbed a video camera and he's videotaping him.  And the black guy's like, stop videotaping me.  He goes, no, I'm scared of you, sir.  I'm scared of you.  I'm protecting myself.  Let's say hi to Steve in New York City. 
[02:10:30]  Steve, what's up?  Yeah, how's it going, Ope?  Hey, Steve.  The other guy?  What's your name?  Just kidding.  Oh, you.  Cut it out.  No, I'm a big fan, Norton.  Thanks, man.  Opie, I seem to remember a day when you were on Night Times at BAB that Howard actually called  into your show to compliment you and tell you that you were doing something different  out there and he was actually singing your praises, unless, of course, that was actually 
[02:11:00]  Anthony calling in to screw with everybody.  But I seem to remember that happening.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  Ah, you never know.  Well, there's also an audio clip of Howard praising how funny Anthony was on his program.  So that's when I was whoring myself out to anybody.  Just put me on the radio, please, somebody.  Well, also, Anthony, since you're talking about yourself there, your Greaseman is so  spot on.  It's ridiculous.  You must have listened to that guy constantly. 
[02:11:30]  I mean, listen, I did, too, because I just thought he was just a ridiculous character and  I couldn't stop listening to him when he was on in New York.  You know what it is?  Your impression is so right on that, I mean, it's...  Thank you, sir.  You know what it was about the Greaseman, though?  The Greaseman, it was one of those things you had to listen for a long period of time  because his stories went on and on and you were waiting for him to end and they didn't.  He would take that lawyer joke we just told and make it into a 20-minute story.  Make it into a 20-minute story. 
[02:12:00]  It would go on and on.  And I'm listening, just laughing at his voice.  Yeah, he would...  And it would just go on and on and then it would end with,  we'll be back with more of the Greaseman, Joe, in a moment.  Yeah, I thought you had to add in 10 minutes of waddle-doodle and...  Waddle-dee-doodle.  Waddle-dee-doodle.  And you're like,  I was slinging lead-dee-doodle.  All right, guys, thanks a lot.  He would take the dopiest, like, three-part joke  and turn it into a 20-minute tirade on something.  There I was.  Like me doing Anthony's impression. 
[02:12:30]  Yes, Greaseman-elli.  I was on the SWAT team in D.C.  Been slinging lead-dee-doodle.  Lots of gunfire in the streets-dee-doodle.  What was the other one about his drinks?  The, uh...  Bone drive.  Bone drive.  I need a bone-dry martini.  Waddle-dee-doodle.  What?  Waddle-doodle?  And I'm sitting there fascinated just looking at the radio.  It was fun to listen to driving around Long Island.  He did pretty well in the afternoon...  No, he did well in the afternoon drive for a while. 
[02:13:00]  In New York City, he did okay.  He was like K-Rock for a little while, wasn't he?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  How he was all mad at that.  Why are you hiring these people that I can't stand to put on my station?  Howard hated whenever the company hired anyone else that had some kind of talent.  Tom, why is this man on my station?  That's what it came down to.  He hated anyone else that had talent.  Anyone else that anyone would listen to.  So then he would do everything in his power to make sure that person did not have a chance. 
[02:13:30]  He tried his best with us, but somehow we squeaked through.  Somehow we squeaked through games he played behind the scenes, yelling and screaming.  They wanted to throw us on K-Rock when we first moved to New York, but Howard wouldn't have of it.  Nope.  And this was before we ever had bad blood or anything.  Yeah.  And that was the logical move.  We were all ready to go to K-Rock.  Was to have us in afternoons, him in mornings, and then you got a great radio station instead of a radio station that has one good day part. 
[02:14:00]  Stupid Kingston gave us the jackets and everything.  We were already over there.  We had decided and we had been accepted by K-Rock.  Dude, we weren't going to be on at any W.  We were going to be afternoons at K-Rock.  Let's not forget, yeah, we had the choice.  We came to New York.  Oh my God, it's a stupid story because our stupid agent, Super Agent Bob Eatman,  and who's, oh, gee.  Well, I remember.  I mean, we're, we blow ourselves up in Boston with the mayors, Frank, right? 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  Now we have three job opportunities.  Anthony and I are from New York.  Born in, I was born in Queens.  Where were you born?  Flushing, Queens.  Queens.  And then lived most of our lives on Long Island until I started doing radio.  So we had a chance to get back on New York radio.  Dream come true.  And our stupid agent thought the best move for us was to move to Atlanta and do mornings.  Yeah.  He didn't quite understand us back then. 
[02:15:00]  He doesn't understand the programming side of what we do.  No.  He's brilliant when it comes to, you know, nickel and diming people to death and getting  a good contract for us.  But he's got to shut the fuck up as far as the programming of this show goes.  Because I was reminded of that because of last week's tirade about he wanted us to do  a clean show so one stupid guy in Philly could go, hey, wait, they do do a really good clean  show.  I'll put him on my commercial station.  And then we go back to doing regular radio and then there's immediately a problem.  They freak out.  Right. 
[02:15:30]  I mean, the logic in that stupid head of his when it comes to programming a radio show  amazes me.  And I forgot that when we first met him, his big move was, no, guys, you really need to  move to Atlanta.  Atlanta?  Yeah.  We had two radio stations right here in New York that wanted us.  Our families are right down the road.  Both the same company.  It was Infinity, you know, K-Rock and WNEW.  And we had checked out both.  It was either going to the morgue, the wax museum that was WNEW, classic rock, classic 
[02:16:00]  jocks, or going over to K-Rock, known, you know, the whole country over, cool station  to be at, cool music.  Playing the same music we were playing in Boston.  Playing in Boston.  So what the hell?  Of course we chose to go to K-Rock.  And we made our decision and we were ready to go and that lasted for about a day.  And then we got the phone call.  No, sorry. 
[02:16:30]  You're not wanted here.  Yeah, they told us to choose between the two.  So we said, yeah, K-Rock.  Yeah.  And then we were, you know, everyone was celebrating.  I remember Kingston, before he became the biggest wimp in the business.  Yeah.  Actually, he got the phone call at dinner and started jumping up and down cheering.  Yeah.  Like he just got the first round draft pick.  It was like an NBA draft or something.  It was.  And he was jumping up and down.  I remember.  The ratings would have been over there with Howard in the morning and us in the afternoon.  He was losing his mind.  And then all of a sudden, 24 hours go by and no one's calling us anymore. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  What happened?  What happened?  And then all of a sudden, oh, well, they decided to pass on you.  Yeah.  No, no one happened.  Howard found out that we picked his station.  I want them on my station.  And he caused, you know, he threw another hissy fit to Mel.  That's a fine how do you do.  And so then they threw us on, you know, N.E.W.  We didn't know at the time it was just going to be an awful experience for us.  What a baby.  And then, yeah, we did great over there.  Yeah.  Had a great run until we screwed it up. 
[02:17:30]  But another hissy fit behind the scenes from Howard.  Yep.  Because he can't take anyone that might have a little talent.  God forbid anyone steals any of the limelight.  All right.  Let's say hi to Kristen, who's in Ohio.  Kristen, what's going on?  Hey.  How are you?  Hi.  Hi.  How are you?  I am wonderful.  How are you?  You, you, you, you girl.  Sort of. 
[02:18:00]  What?  Nothing.  What do you want to do today, Kristen?  I'm going to see if you guys want to play a good game of what's in my pants.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  Is this your picture I'm looking at?  Yes.  Cool.  Oh.  What part of Ohio are you from?  Cincinnati.  You're from Ohio, Willard?  Cincinnati, Ohio?  Is that the fat capital of Ohio?  I've never been to Cincinnati.  It's a nice place.  Yeah, it's not too bad. 
[02:18:30]  Kristen, describe yourself for the listeners.  Yeah.  Well, I am 5'9".  Oh, you're 5'9".  I'm sorry?  5'9".  Okay.  5'9".  Probably about 170 pounds.  170?  Yeah.  A little hefty.  You're a little hefty?  Yeah, but that's all up top.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I was going to say that because you've got like a men's shirt on in this picture and 
[02:19:00]  you're leaning forward and there's still just a lot of stuff happening, so I'm thinking  you have massive boobs.  Yeah.  What size is it?  38DD.  38DD.  Okay, I'm getting all her stats down, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  Bye.  How big is that A?  Yeah.  B what?  How big is that A? 
[02:19:30]  Actually, I don't have much of a butt.  Wait, wait.  You're truly enchanted.  It's flat?  Yeah, kind of.  But it's wide at the hips, right?  Uh, no.  Actually, I don't have very many hips.  I kind of just go straight down.  Very many.  Wow, this is getting sexier and sexier as we go.  Yeah.  What about your, um, your, uh, your hair?  Uh, it pretty much looks like it does in the picture.  Short blonde. 
[02:20:00]  Uh-huh.  Yeah, you might want to grow your hair longer.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  And maybe some...  I'm working on it.  Maybe some bangs.  Maybe a dentist, too.  I see, uh...  No.  All right.  Cool.  So you're going to play, um, what's in my slacks?  Yeah.  Are you on the road right now?  Uh, yeah, actually I am.  Where are you headed?  I'm a truck driver, so... 
[02:20:30]  Oh, you're a trucker.  Oh, wow, that's a surprise.  All right.  Now I understand everything.  Say what?  You're a trucker?  Yes.  I don't know what's in her pants, but I bet it smells like Bourbon Street.  Okay.  All right, a trucker.  All right, and you got your big rig, uh, pulled over to the side?  Yes, I do.  Pulled over to truck stop.  Cool.  All right, uh, are you wearing something that's easy access?  Uh, yeah, actually. 
[02:21:00]  What are you wearing?  Uh, blue jeans and a t-shirt.  Or a feed bag.  Uh-huh.  Um, what's that sound?  I'm trying to plug my phone in before my battery dies.  Okay.  Oh, come on, battery.  Sorry.  I never rooted for a battery in all my life.  That battery sounds exhausted.  Don't let it rest. 
[02:21:30]  Poor guy.  The battery might go out?  Uh, no, my cell phone battery's about to die, and it's, like, got this little flap at the  bottom, and I can't get it to come off with a good-looking battery.  What's it, full of crumb cake or something?  You're not on your way to Jersey to get married, are you?  What?  Where do you live?  Where do I live?  Cincinnati?  Cincinnati, Ohio.  Yeah.  Did you, uh, fix the battery problem? 
[02:22:00]  Yes, I did.  Okay.  Damn it!  Thanks, Jimmy.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  He's such a...  He just doesn't get it sometimes, Jimmy.  I know.

Are we ready for the theme song?  Um, what the...  Oh!  Oh, the theme song.  Sure.  Yeah, we're getting ready to play Guess What's in My Pants with this Fat Pig.

[02:25:00]  I'm just going to guess a hoagie  All right, Kristen  Yeah  What you'll do is take your phone  And people wonder why we haven't done this in a while  Rub it on that very special place  And we will listen  And try to hear what type of hairstyle you have  You'll rub it up and down  Her very special place is her mouth  And then side to side  And then in a circular fashion  Don't at any time tell us what type of hairstyle you have 
[02:25:30]  Until we ask what is in your pants  Do you understand the rules, Kristen?  I do  All right  If you could rub the phone now up and down  Okay  All right  Up and down  Okay  All right  And now side to side  Okay  Side to side  And now a circular motion, please 
[02:26:00]  Around the whole area  All right  The entire area  Kristen  Yeah  I'm a professional at this  I've been doing this for many years  I've listened to many, many areas  Being rubbed by a phone  And I am saying right now  You are not rubbing that phone on your area  Yes, I am  Be honest  Now, please  Be honest with us 
[02:26:30]  It doesn't matter  What were you rubbing that on?  I seriously am  I think she's lying, Opie  I did not hear anything  That remotely sounded like that area  Well, let's all listen again  All right  Rub the phone both one more time  All right  It's too smooth  It's  There's no  Difference in the sounds  From any folds  And believe me  There's probably plenty of folds  That means 
[02:27:00]  That could mean she's very hairy  That's what I'm thinking too  Can we have circular again?  Listen  All right  Hold on  When does she have time to shave  With all that eating she's doing?  I don't hear anything  It could be my phone  Consistent sound  All right  Why don't we just get it over with?  Okay  I'm going to say  Vinyl seat  You're going to say what? 
[02:27:30]  It's a new category  He really doesn't believe that you're naked  Yeah, I don't believe you're rubbing it on your most intimates  Is there anyone around that can prove that you're naked?  Uh, no  Okay  Uh, Jimmy to you  Uh, I'm going to guess that you have a, uh  A trim  Like, what's the choice?  Yeah  The, uh  It's a mohawk  Right  Uh, well actually  The, the standard issue triangle  The mohawk  The Hitler mustache  Or the wood floor 
[02:28:00]  I say she has a standard issue trim down  All right  I'm going to guess, uh  Seventies earth mama muff  Seventies earth  You're going for the big hairy  Uh  Oh yeah  All right  Oh yeah  All right  Well, um  Kristen, uh  What is in your pants?  The, uh  Triangle trim down  Yeah, but  How trim down?  Uh  Uh, just the bikini line  But I mean  Is it short hairs  Or is it like 
[02:28:30]  I mean  Short hair  I don't want to get too long  There was no  Difference in the sound  When she went around in a circle  You always hear  Like the thuds of the  The area itself  Maybe she's only doing it in the pubic region  Do it one more time  Circular  Okay  Hold on  I got it 
[02:29:00]  You got it?

Okay  And, uh  And you overheard a conversation about us?  Yeah, I overheard a conversation  Not by Joe Schmo  By some brass 
[02:33:00]  And if it was, you know  Joe Schmo, who cared?  You know  You know, just  It's going to happen  Just remember  Jimmy Norton from New York said it  By the way, Jimmy  I can't get tickets  For the goddamn show tomorrow  Alright?  Love you, buddy  Why can't you, fella?  Probably sold out  We went with that call  Because, I mean  Well, there is  Whatever  We hear things  We have heard things  Whatever  We'll see what happens  Alright, um  Couple other great little stories  For today  Did we get that promo, by the way? 
[02:33:30]  I was trying to figure out  What that new promo was all about  And then I'm hearing  It has something to do  With a promo  We sent down to Washington  And they got really pissed off  At us or something  We got a complaint  We got a complaint  A complaint?  One complaint  About what?  Hawk  We ran one of our daily promos  On another channel  It was about Hillary Clinton  And diarrhea  And it ran around the same time  That she had the  The fainting spell  And all that  And somebody  Well, the reason it ran  Around the same time  Is that  Because it was based on  The news story 
[02:34:00]  Yeah  And somebody registered  A complaint  It wasn't a coincidence  From us  It was  Do we have the complaint?  That  Ben is  Well, it's amazing  How in corporate America  This is why corporate people  Are such scum  Somebody just said  Tough shit  No, no  God almighty  One person  Out of millions  What was the complaint about?  Let's get Ben or Steve in here  Alright  One person out of millions  Complaint  There you go  And they buckle  Oh, I don't play that one anymore 
[02:34:30]  It might be amusing  I'm still confused  There was a promo  That  I guess it was  Some audio of the bit  Where you're  Making believe you're Hillary  And trying to give  One of her awful speeches  And she's like  You know  Farting through it  Because she had  This stomach thing happen  Really?  I don't even remember  Doing that  I think so  Really?  Because she passed out  And it turned out  She had like  A 24 hour bug  Or something  So we assumed  Then, well  She had to be  You know  The diarrhea  Had to have  Something happen  In there  So we did  A little mock  Hillary Clinton  Speech thing  Where she would be 
[02:35:00]  Farting  While she was  Trying to talk  Okay  Because she was  Continuing her  Engagements  We don't have  The spot?  I think they're  Working on it now  I want to  Can we get  Somebody in here  For the  Well, I asked for Ben  But he's still  Kind of just hanging out  God, these guys  Are just the worst  They just are  I'm sure they're  Eagerly  Do they understand  We're doing a radio show?  Like, we're just  Sitting here now  And everyone's  Running around  Like, you know  You kick a pile of ants  And they just run around  Like, with no organization 
[02:35:30]  That's what's going on here  You kick a dog  And he runs around  Until he drops dead  Harry, instead of  Writing it down  Say what you have to say  Please  You don't want to say it?  Why?  Because I can't  Why can't you say it?  Well, someone tell me  What's going on  Why can't you say it?  Write it down  And we'll say it  Alright, write it down  I don't even know  Why I'm being called in here  First of all  This is fantastic  This is our staff  You know we're doing  A radio show, right?  Yes, I'm perfectly aware  Of that  Okay, we broadcast live  From 6 to 10 
[02:36:00]  And sometimes we discuss things  Yes, of course  And maybe it would be  A good idea that  You had your ear to the ground  So you kind of  Know what's going on  It's ear to the ground  And it started a forest fire  Yeah, exactly  So I have to be very careful  What is  Let me see what he wrote  What you couldn't say on the air?  Let me see  Well, this is what  Oh my God  Ben said be careful  Complaint went up to  Hugh Panera  Who cares?  Oh my God  They complained  And the boss heard  So what  The complaint went to you  Personally?  Oh, yeah 
[02:36:30]  It's about the promo  What was wrong with the promo?  I don't know  I don't know specifically  Because I didn't make it  Apparently  Let me hear it  We're trying to find it  Derek's looking for the audio  Who made the promo?  I guess Derek made a promo  When we were away  And somebody complained  About the context  So we're looking to find out  What exactly  Alright, so  You know  Now if this was on  A non-paying channel  Or non-pay  Wait, what?  Well, was it vulgar?  No, I don't think  I'm not sure exactly  What was in it  I don't think  These guys know  They're not supposed to put  Vulgar material in it 
[02:37:00]  They know they're not supposed to put  Racist anti-Semitic promo  They know about that  So I'm not sure exactly  What set the person off  So maybe she had a legitimate complaint  Entirely possible  But I don't know  Until I hear it  What station did this air on?  I doubt they had a legitimate complaint  I know it was  It was a non  It was one of like the  It was a third party  So then you made a promo  That we just played  What was that about?  Which one was it?  The laughing  Oh, the laughing one  Yeah, that was trying to  You know  Do a  A little  You know  A vague  Sympathic rebuttal  Yeah, thank you 
[02:37:30]  So it's bleeps  And us laughing  Like the good part  Was bleeped out  Yeah  Okay, exactly  But nobody will know that  Unless we play the Hillary audio  To see what offended people  Yeah, right  That's where this all comes from  I heard the new promo  Going, what does that even mean?  But I didn't know  It was because it was about  You know  The rebuttal to the Clinton promo  I guarantee you  It was over a political affiliation  And not being offended  Right  If it was a Bush trashing thing  Some idiot would have complained about that  Some conservative  I didn't care for that  Yeah 
[02:38:00]  I would love to hear it  Well, this guy  Heard the promo on the comedy channel  That would be 150  Carl in Jersey  What's up, Carl?  Hey, what's happening?  Hi, Carl  How's it going?  Jimmy Pants, how are you?  Good, Carl  All right  I thought that I heard that promo  And they were talking about  She was sick  And everybody in the campaign  Was sick  Or around her  Oh, but we must keep working  Or something like that  But it was the funniest thing  I ever heard, guys  Who could be offended by that crowd?  It was definitely what I'm thinking  And then Anthony went into  Like a mock Hillary type voice 
[02:38:30]  And farting as she's doing a speech  Or whatever  Yeah  Well, I think it was funny as hell  I don't know why somebody would be chasing  And it was on the comedy channel?  It might be because it was bathroom humor  And I don't know  It might have been another channel  They played on  That we don't know yet  It might have been  No, he said he heard it from the comedy channel  He did  But I'm saying  The person that can complain  Might have heard on that  Might have heard it  Somewhere else  Alright, well  I'm sorry to waste your time  But I didn't understand  What the new promo was about  I didn't know there was a whole back story  I have a question  And now this back story  Can't be 
[02:39:00]  We have to be careful  How we talk about it on the air  Why?  No, we don't  Because the complaint went to Hugh Pinero  I'm sure he gets a bunch of complaints  Yes  Somebody complained to Hugh  No one is saying  We hate Hugh Pinero  We just want to know what happened  And it doesn't say  We hate Hillary  Just because we mocked her  We do  We do hate her  For other reasons  She stinks  I have a question by the way  Before you go on to this  Speaking of XM  I just got to know  I just want to throw it out there  Apparently there's this douchebag  Who wants to be talked about  So I'll talk about him 
[02:39:30]  This boneyard guy  Cool guy  Yeah  Who's been trashing the show  So dude, if you're listening  No one here listens to you  And we can't get audio  Because you have four listeners  So if you want to say something  Please call in  We will put you on the air  If you want attention that bad  You're welcome to call into the show  And voice  He's like this over the hill  Wannabe rocker  Who has like a show  And he's been trashing the show  So I would like to know  What he has to say  Is that the guy that said  He was going to slap me  Or punch me when he saw me  Same jerk off  Another all talk 
[02:40:00]  No action guy  Because I walked right by him  In the hall  Come, you know  To do our show  When we were down there  Did he smack you?  No  He didn't smack me  No  No one's going to smack me  Cool guy  He didn't even attempt  Cool guy  He didn't even attempt  Any type of confrontation  Huh  That's why you're a phony  And that's why you're stuck  Just playing records  You idiot  Well he had another show  Apparently  Which failed  He's a failed  He's a wannabe  And we all know what that is  Yeah  And now he's trashing the show 
[02:40:30]  And we all know  You're a little jealous  You've been at XM for a while  I'm sorry man  Nobody  Noticed you  I apologize  That that happened  And then the ONA show comes  And gets all the attention  All the press  And you resent that  And I understand that  Nobody wants to have had a dream  And failed at it  Yeah  So please  If you want to call in  You will be put on the air  And people will hear you out  But don't be a little faggot  And hide on your  Nobody listens to you dude  You're on overnight  Nobody cares  So you want to say it 
[02:41:00]  Call in here  Everybody will hear it  You're invited to call in  And I walked right by the guy  He didn't confront me  He didn't try to smack me  Or punch me like he's been saying  On his stupid radio show  The reality is  If you play records  On a radio station  You're either an underachiever  And you just don't really  Want to work hard  Which is cool  Want to smoke your dope  And smoke your cigarettes  And drink at night  And come in  And have a cushy job  Or you're a failure  At this business  And you stink  That's it  That's about it  And I know I just insult 
[02:41:30]  A lot of people  But that's the fact  Too bad  Anyone could spin records  And talk a little bit  Between the records  Anyone could do that  Anyone  So maybe you can call it  Maybe you can call it  With one of the characters  You used to do  On your old show  That failed  I'm trying to get audio  There's no one  Has audio of this guy  So if you have this  Jerk offs audio  Please send it to  Steven Foundry  Because we're trying to find it  And nobody has it  So apparently  Your listeners don't care  About you enough  To record anything  You say ever  He's a phony dude 
[02:42:00]  Simple as that  He was talking about  How he was going to  Smack me and punch me  When he saw me  I walked right by the guy  Nothing  He didn't even flinch  He wants attention  We're not in an  Arbitron ratings war  So what's he on  The Boneyard  Cool guy  Tune in  Listen to him  Tune in  And listen to him  I guarantee he stinks  Let's say hi to Joe  Hey Joe what's up  Hey how's it going guys  Good Joe  Yeah I remember the promo  I heard it on a couple  A couple times  On your station  The comedy station  Pretty much what you said  And then Norton  Had the kicker  That she farted 
[02:42:30]  And filled up  Both sides of her  Pantyhose with diarrhea  Oops  Both sides of her  Pantyhose  That conjures up an image  Awesome  You guys rock  Thanks  If that's on the comedy channel  And somebody complained  They should have their stomach  Stared like in  Godfather 2  But if that was on  Like the 80s station  I can kind of see them  Getting pissed off  Alright Anthony  The Vermont Teddy Bear Company  Valentine's Day  Right around the corner  It's Monday right  Yes  And a lot of guys  Are out there  They're going to panic  And go to the mall  And try to find something  Last minute

[02:46:30]  Actually fall  Into the soup  Wait did I say that  Oh my god  What did I say  You just said  Did the soup  Actually fall  Into the soup  Well that's a legitimate question  Because sometimes  Soup will get mixed up  And I hate when  Another man's soup  Falls into my soup  Did your phone  Fall into your phone  Wow  Alright  Did you guys  Have fun  What  Did you guys have fun  Yeah we had a great time  Tom  Thanks to you  A lot of fun there  Tom  Yes 
[02:47:00]  Good job  And I thank you  For not showing up  That second day  You're quite welcome  Gave us a little break  From Tom  On that second day  Gave us a little  Breathing room  Tom what happened  With my shots  At the strip club  When the shot girl  Came over  And you said  You were getting shots  And then she had to  Come over to me  For the money  And apologize  That she had to  Ask me for money  Were you  I mean I  I have no idea dude  I was buying shots  I know I walked in  And got your girl  At one of those  Gigantic daiquiris  Oh you did 
[02:47:30]  Whatever you need  Yeah  Whatever you need  Except for the shots  Because I'm hearing  You were a little cheap  With some of the people  I don't think so  I heard you were  The second cheapest person  That was with us  Who was the first  No don't get it wrong  It's not Opie  No it was not me  It was just somebody else  Somebody else was cheap  Somebody else was cheap  Part of the collection  Of people that we  Were traveling with  I didn't hear that 
[02:48:00]  I've been hearing things  I hear things  Things you heard  I heard things  Go ahead Anthony  Why don't you tell everyone  Who the cheapo was  I don't know  Go ahead Anthony  I just heard  There might have been  Somebody that  Never even  Not even offered  To pay for anything  But actually fled  The scene of a check  Where's Ben  Were you there  When this happened  The last night  We were there  I believe I did  Witness this  So why don't you  Make the announcement  On the program  Who is the cheap person 
[02:48:30]  I  Can you not be a wimp  For once in your  Yeah  Come on Anthony  Have a little gumption  I'm just quite a wimpy guy  What are you going to do  Come in and karate kick you  I didn't say that  I know I'm  Oh my god  That isn't even where  I was going  Are you saying that  Master Poe was cheap  I wasn't going there  I didn't mention a name  Or nothing  Well you're not talking  About Opie  We all know  You're not afraid of me  What is Steve going to do  You'll just flick your  Little finger into his stomach  And double him over  And Ben would come in 
[02:49:00]  And you wouldn't be afraid  To tell Ben  So who could it be  Who else was with us  Opie's brother  Brett's in Long Island  What's he going to do  Drive out and hit  You'll be gone already  Kenny was with us  Kenny's in another state  He's not even around right now  Plus he's big and stupid  He wouldn't even know  You're talking about him  So who else could it be  I'm not saying  You're saying that  Mr. Poe is cheap  I did not say that  I said that  That somebody  Why are you getting all nervous  Somebody  I think what Anthony said is  What's Poe saving up to be 
[02:49:30]  Jewish  I don't think  Even Sergeant Barnes  laughed at that one  Oh Jesus  Are you saving up to be  Jewish  No I wouldn't  I wouldn't say that at all  I was just saying that  There were rumors  I didn't see anything  First hand  I heard rumors  You heard rumors  That somebody  I heard that he went out  One night  And I wasn't even there  That's what I'm hearing from  I heard he went out  Who else was with us  Is it true you want to  Change his name to 
[02:50:00]  Master Cheapo  I didn't say anything  I'm talking  He said it  Master Poe  Uh oh  He's coming in  He should come in  He has his event  I didn't say anything  What I was hearing  Was that there was a night  That the guys went out  Maybe too  I believe Jaime was out  That evening too  And there was  Tom was there  I believe  Wasn't that the night  Did you guys go out  Yes we did  After you guys went to sleep  And you  Did you go with Tom 
[02:50:30]  Uh yes  Yeah Tom was there  And uh  Who else  There was  There was Tom  Ed and Jaime  Ed right  Ed was the other guy  And I was just hearing  Things  You know  How people talk  And there was  Uh there was  Talk  That uh  That uh  A poll ran out  Uh without uh  Paying uh  Helping to pay  For the check  That was part of  What I heard  I wasn't there  I  I 
[02:51:00]  I'm hearing things  Ben could probably  I'm trying to get Ben  In here  And Eric saying  That he can't come in  Because he's on the phone  With the boss  Why won't he come in  He's on the phone  This is busy  He can't come in  Get that  Herky jerky headed  Son of a bitch  In here  He must come in  I have no idea  What they're talking about  Alright  I'm satisfied  They can come up to me  And talk to me  In front of me 
[02:51:30]  That's right  Go to Master  Poe's face  And talk  That's right Ben  Instead of calling  On the phone  Calling on the phone  No  It was an open discussion  In the office  As soon as we got in  Did I see you in the office  Yeah it was  I know I paid for two checks  And no one even thanked me  I'll be honest  Wait a second  I paid for the first night  And I paid for the last night  And I didn't even get a thank you  From just about everyone in this room  I wasn't there first night  So yeah I'll tell you  I didn't get one thank you from you  And I picked up two dinner checks 
[02:52:00]  I will definitely go on record and say that  People just assume because I make money  That I'll pick up all the checks  And you know  At least people should thank me  What?  Yeah I'll definitely fucking say it  Opie  After I chased the guy  That was cursing and yelling  And causing a problem in front of you  After I chased him away  I took my credit card  And I placed it on the table  For your brother to pay  But I ended up paying the check  And no one came up to me  And said thank you  Yes  A lot of people just assume  That it's well  You know it's the Opie Anthony show  They should pay our way 
[02:52:30]  Well you were on the phone  I couldn't interrupt you  And what about the first night?  The first night  I did say thank you  At the 201 club?  That was the first night  I did say thank you  If you did then I apologize  But the last night  Definitely not  No one did  I said thank you  I offered your money  I always say thank you  Oh no Jimmy did offer me money  And that night  I threw my credit card on the table  But there was confusion  The last night  There was absolute confusion  Because Kenny  Someone  The waiter said  That Kenny said  I don't care why  I had to pay for it  I would like a thank you 
[02:53:00]  Because I'm sure  I'll get most of it back  Eventually reimbursed  Whatever  Because it's an XM trip  But you know  A thank you goes a long way  And remember that  If you have a Vermont teddy bear  A thank you goes a long way  The thank you bear  If your friend buys you dinner  You send a thank you  The thank you bear  But now I'm hearing you  What happened with Jaime  And I don't know  Tom was complaining  That you stiffed him  On like 800 bucks  It wasn't Jaime  800 bucks  Well no  He got cut in half  Tom  Yeah  What happened  Master Poe didn't pay up  When you guys all went out 
[02:53:30]  Tom  I stiffed you  Careful Tom  No we were actually  Careful Tom  We're drinking free  And I don't know  Usually it takes a mean punch  To punch someone's teeth out  But with Tom  All you have to do is go  And Anthony I did thank you  All right  You know that  I don't know if you thanked me for dinner  I did  You weren't at dinner  Well no you didn't  Good thing you did  Because Anthony paid that one  Anthony paid that one  So there was no reason to thank me  You idiot  That was a six  I thanked you right  Anthony  Six hundred dollar dinner also 
[02:54:00]  That was  That night  Six bills  I thanked both you guys  That was delicious  All right  So what happened with Master Poe then  Nothing  He just had a little problem  In the back  Did I pay my bill  Tom  Yes  Thank you  All right  There you go  So there was a rumor  That's why we had to ask  It was asked  Because there was people talking  Boy what a surprise  Another rumor from Ben  That's wrong  Tom did we have a good time  We had a ball  Thank you very much  For your hospitality  Tom you don't even remember 
[02:54:30]  You're quite welcome  What was the problem in the back  What problem in the back  What happened  I was kind of confused  I didn't know exactly  What had happened  But it all got worked out  All right  Was there a bloody ghee involved  All right Tom  Thanks  All right well  Until next time  There he goes  Tom from New Orleans  All right  So problem straightened out  That's why rumors start  All right Master Poe  Thank you very much gentlemen  Opie  I'll say this in front of everyone  Thank you very much  For that delicious meal  The last night  It was great  All right good  Thank you  I want you to acknowledge  That amazing shot I did too 
[02:55:00]  Oh  What  The amazing shot I did  What shot  With the beads  Oh you didn't know about that  Oh the bead  Right right  Poor Kenny  Poor club soda Kenny  Just wanted to drink his water  And Opie threw a  Well I was at  Another table  There was two tables  We were about ten feet apart  Yeah  So I decided to take a bead  And I saw Kenny  Had a nice glass of water  And I'm like  There's no way I'm going to make it  But I'll try  And I went boom  And you know  Swish  Yeah  Right into his water  His glass of water  So then I get really cocky 
[02:55:30]  And  Because Kenny will not drink  Tap water on the road  Which is smart  Because Steve ended up  Getting the liquid shits  From drinking  And vomiting  And vomiting  From drinking some of the local water  Little change per stomach  So Kenny orders another glass of water  Because he's not going to drink it now  And it comes in a bottle  You know a regular water bottle  That Anthony has to his side  Right there  I'm ten feet away  I take a bead  And I just aim for the bottle of water  Like yeah right  This is going to work  And I just throw it  And I'm looking around the table  Like where did it bounce to 
[02:56:00]  And Anthony starts freaking out  He goes  Oh my god  Right in  Right in the bottle of water  Right in  Do you know you can shoot a thousand times  From this distance  And not make that  Never make that shot  It's just one of those weird  Lucky things  That will never happen again  And poor Kenny had to sit there  And wait for that guy  To bring him another water  And then everyone was encouraging me  To go for a third shot  I'm like no way  Two for two  I'm done right here  You gotta leave that  So I guess it was rumor  And speculation  On that whole Poe thing  That's why you gotta ask  Because then people build up resentment 
[02:56:30]  For no reason  See  Alright I got the promo  That everyone is pissed off about  Finally  Here it is  It's the worst  Of the Opie and Anthony show  So Hillary Clinton  She fainted  She fainted  Because she had some kind of stomach flu right  Yeah apparently she had a stomach flu  She fainted  She  You know what that means  She also had the squirts probably  Yeah they said  Probably squirting out  Out of that pantsuit  She sneezed  And filled both ankles  Of her pantyhose  And she's practicing  Her speech on the bowl 
[02:57:00]  Senator  She's on the bowl  Alright alright  I'm not feeling very well  We need  Someone in charge  That knows  New York  The Opie and Anthony show  Live  Weekdays  6 to 10 a.m.  With replays throughout the day  On XM 202  Hey this is Opie  To get channel 202  In the opening  Look I don't run the company  Obviously  But  So they do what they have to do 
[02:57:30]  That promo can run on any station  Come on  That can run on regular radio  Please  That is so  It's childish  And juvenile  Yeah  But there's nothing vicious in that  There's nothing  There's no profanity in that  You can't  Cater to a complaint like that  A complaint  There's nothing going on there  Let's all relax  So then that's where Steve came up with the other promo  Where it's a lot of bleeps and us laughing  Yeah  Yeah  Because there was one complaint 
[02:58:00]  Do we have that one Derek?  Alright  So because of the Clinton promo  Steve came up with this in response I guess  It's the Opie and Anthony show  Your home for good, clean, wholesome family entertainment  That is such a long way to go just to say  Steve has lost his mind first of all 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, that's pretty funny  That's great though  But that's a funny promo  Steve has lost his mind 
[02:59:00]  Yeah  He really has  And is there a way for us to find out what channel that they got the complaint through?  There's got to be  Like I heard that on the such and such channel  We'd like to know  Unless it was XM Kids  I think they went a little overboard  Even that  Did you hear the Cricket Duty song or whatever?  That's true  The Duty song  Sitting on the toilet making a doody  That's true  The Doody Weasel song  Why is that fine?  And there's little poopy noises  Pop goes the doody  Or something like that  Poop goes the weasel  Oh, poop goes the weasel  Just the weasel 
[02:59:30]  But weasel has the diapers on  Goes the weasel  Yeah, right there  That's on the Kids channel  Alright, that's enough  Why don't we take a quick break?  We'll continue with the Opie and Anthony program  Is Flavor Filet showing up today?  Flavor Filet?  Huh?  That's not him  That's a white guy with the camera  I know, who's that guy though?  Alright, well take a break  We'll figure this mess out  Life in corporate America can be a grind  All they do is they remove the humor from everything

[03:01:30]  I'm Starker Patty making her way into the studio to do some news for us  You know, I thought this was going to be the best story of the day here 
[03:02:00]  It says, stick them up  I have a gub  A gub  Robber who can't spell faces a long sentence  But it looks like he was doing it on purpose to throw the cops off  I thought it was a real dummy  Maybe it's not as good  The article goes on to say  Can you spell gotcha  Oh my god  It's hysterical  Nothing  A prolific bank robber 
[03:02:30]  Yeah  Thank you  You have it  I hate that one  Mine wasn't working  A prolific bank robber who passed demand notes littered with spelling errors like the word robbery  R-O-B-R-Y  Will now have plenty of time to study the dictionary according to cops  Plenty of time  Park Thomas 43 of Ronkonkoma has been charged with six bank robberies in Nassau County  And linked to nine other heists in Suffolk  Dating to June 2003  Cops who dubbed Thomas the Spelling Bee Bandit  Believed the spelling errors may have been done intentionally to convince cops they were chasing an illiterate crook 
[03:03:00]  Ah  So that's the end of that story  I thought it was a  I thought it was a real dummy  I have a gub  Yeah I mean  Yeah exactly  That's pretty funny  Alright let's get  Oh she's here  Hi Patty  Okay  Hello  So you want to try out to do news on our program?  Oh just for a lark  Just for fun  Why you don't think you're good enough huh?  Oh I don't know I've never done the news before 
[03:03:30]  No  Surprising I thought you had a lot of news experience  Oh  Well the  Oh I'm a new experience alright  You know some of the brass over there in Washington at XM have decided perhaps we need a news person on our program  Oh  So we've been auditioning some people  They've been coming in and they've pretty much stunk  And now I think the best so far has been Club Soda Kenny  Yeah Kenny had something going on 
[03:04:00]  We're going to have to have him come back and do like one of those review things again  Interesting little take on the news  When he called Condoleezza  Whatever her name is there  Rice  Rice  Bush's secretary  Bush's secretary  That was brilliant  Yeah  Starker Patty you ready to do the news?  I'm ready to do the news  Why don't we give this a shot Anthony  See what happens  Nice  We got Flavor Flay on the way into the studio in a few minutes here  So but first it's Starker Patty with the news  Okay  Well the head of a major U.S. company has just resigned from the board of Vermont's most prestigious hospital over a teddy bear 
[03:04:30]  The crazy for you bear is the center of the controversy  Alright hold it hold it Patty  Maybe you ought to pick a different story  You idiot  Maybe you ought to not pick a story about our only sponsor  Oh my god  Maybe you ought to be smart enough to know why we haven't grabbed that story  We ran with it ourselves  Some allegations of pedophilia 
[03:05:00]  Hint taken  Okay I'll go to the next one  Hint taken  How about fist taken in face  Oh my god  I'm sorry  Alright let's go back to the sound thing here  And here it is  Stark Patty with the news  American Airlines is looking to save money like everybody is nowadays  And you see it's going to be a little harder as a result  They're going to save $370,000 by eliminating all the pillows on their flight  They want to smother you with  But not completely 
[03:05:30]  If you fly coast to coast or on an international flight you'll still get to rest your head  Are you trying to do it like a news voice?  Yeah  You see the base of your neck?  What's going on over there?  You're putting on a little voice like you do on Entertainment Tonight or something  I watch a little too much of Channel 7 News on TV  Well mostly to hear the numbers  Okay  Is that why you said nowadays?  Well how about the sports story I copied from the news this morning  The Knicks failed to beat the Heat 
[03:06:00]  And overtime results in meltdown  I guess it means they lost  That concludes the sports  That concludes the sports is a huge story today  Giambi's finally going to talk about his steroids  But that's as long as my attention span is regarding sports  The only thing I watch once a year is the Super Bowl  And that's about it  I can't  That whistle that's  When she does her S's 
[03:06:30]  It goes through me like a laser  You have one sports score  There's major headlines in sports today  The NHL season is pretty much done with  If they don't come to some kind of decision by the weekend  That's done  Jason Giambi's going to be talking about steroids today  For the first time  He's got some tough questions to answer  Sure  And then Hakeem Olajuwon might be tied to terrorism  What?  Who?  He was like  He was sending money to some kind of charity  That might be connected to terrorism 
[03:07:00]  So there's a little confusion there  Well that's what he's saying obviously  Yeah why would he blow  You know America was very very good to him  Why would he you know turn around and then support terrorism  I'm sure I don't know  Educated Khaled Sheikh Mohammed too  So  Number three man in Al-Qaeda  Giambi's going to be talking though today  Yep  Talking about his steroid use  You'll see a much thinner Jason Giambi today  Yes  How about the weather report?  Alright go ahead  Cloudy and rainy  And you should wear a coat and carry an umbrella 
[03:07:30]  Because it's also cold and wet  And that was my observation  Cloudy and rainy  And then you add cold and wet  I like to get to the point  The barometer always falling  Unfortunately you're not down the stairs  How about more headlines Patty?  Yeah what about the lady they found in the water tank?  Yep  They were looking for her for a few days 
[03:08:00]  And they finally found her  Apparently she fell in  A few days  Yeah a few hours  They're not sure if she just fell in  They think there might have been a little of that  What do they call it?  That foul play  Ooh  Well they would have to investigate  Who was working at the time  Oh  Wow  That was pretty good reporting  I don't know  That was actually very good on the fly  Yeah  This is pretty creepy though  Shut up for a second there  Patty  Thank you  Divers found the body of a New Jersey water treatment chemist  At the bottom of a gigantic underground tank last night 
[03:08:30]  And investigators are looking into the possibility of foul play  Meanwhile the Passaic Valley Water Commission advised its customers in 17 towns to boil their water  A customary precaution when a foreign object is found in the tank  A foreign object?  What was she?  Huh?  Oh what  Well  A-N-G-A-R-A  But she could be married  She looks great  Yikes 
[03:09:00]  Where is she from?  A foreign object  Rodriguez  So you're boiling your water because a dead woman was in it  In Jersey  Yeah that's what they're recommending  So when you  That's their precaution  When you drink out of your faucet  Boil the water  But still know  That like  All her private area was just soaking in your water  Making tea  Yeah  A little puby hair in there  She's making chemist soup  I would go to the store and get bottled water 
[03:09:30]  Really would you?  Yes  What else might you do in that situation?  I wouldn't drink the water from the faucet  When do you think you can go and get this bottled water?  Actually I give bottled water to my own cat  Because I will not feed her from the faucet  Thank you Captain Obvious  We got ice cream  Legs of lamb  And one dead chemist  I was thinking  Eh maybe I'll just try the water 
[03:10:00]  And see how it tastes  Before I go and maybe get bottled water  I wouldn't take the rest  Kill yourself!  The devil  You give your cat  Bottled water  Yes I do  And why is that?  Because I don't drink from the faucet myself  So why should Evie?  That's your cat's name Evie?  Yes  What's that short for?  Evelyn  She was Evelyn at the shelter  And I brought her home  And shortened it to Evie  Cat named Evelyn  One cat you shortened your life 
[03:10:30]  Oh thank you  What an awful thing for a cat  Sitting there at the shelter  And Patty comes and gets you  Thank you Evie  The cat actually said  Alright I'll take her  Alright thanks Patty  That was good actually  I think Patty deserves another shot  One of these days  Do you have any entertainment news?  Hmm  Okay  Anything on the Michael Jackson case?  I read something about Lizzie Grubman  Using her staff  And they're posing in magazines and stuff 
[03:11:00]  So that she could get more publicity  For her company  Ooh  Tell us more  Wow that was a handy little tidbit  I might repeat around the water cooler  What about music news?  Music news  There's a big music news story today  Okay  What about the fact that  Johnny Knoxville's banging Lindsay Lohan?  Yeah  Actually I don't even know  Who Johnny Knoxville is  What?  No  I don't listen to his music I guess  Well how do you feel  Oh my god  You're a blithering idiot 
[03:11:30]  You know the dude from Jackass?  I never watched the show  But I know what show you mean  I tried to watch the show once  And I couldn't deal with it  So I had to turn it off  Because they got a little bit crazy  Oh crazy insane nuts  Is what they get  Hi this is Johnny Knoxville  And I'm banging Lindsay Lohan  Remember that?  Remember?  Hi I'm Johnny Knoxville  And  Yeah I remember that 
[03:12:00]  And I'm going to get shot by a shotgun  Today  Right  But I still don't know who he is  So  Hey  If I don't know something  I say it  You know  Oh because you're so outrageous  Well the big story Anthony  Mick Mars is getting divorced  And this just sent you into a little  Oh  A little tizzy  They're not married though  Not even married  Girlfriend  Nope  Girlfriend  Thanks for correcting me  This whore  This whore  Who decided she was going to latch on  To a motley crew member 
[03:12:30]  Literally  Is now suing  For ten million dollars  Ten million bucks  She wants half of everything he has  Plus support payments  And damages  Damages  For this guy supporting her  There you go  And it's California  So you know something  She's probably going to get it  They have that whole palimony thing out there  Where if you live with somebody long  Enough  And I guess she hooked up with  Mick in the early 90's  And stayed with him to 
[03:13:00]  I guess 2000  So  She was with him through the 90's  Probably led a pretty nice life  With him  Ten million dollars worth  But the early 90's  I mean that wasn't the heyday of motley  No  Absolutely not  But she wants half of everything he has  Plus  Now you got half  Plus  Support  So he still has to pay her  And damages  What kind of damages  So basically she's trying to say  That she's more important 
[03:13:30]  To motley crew  Than Mick was  Right  Right  And there's a lawyer  That is agreeing with this  Because he  Somehow promised  To take care of her  For the rest of  Their lives  And  She was going to be  A documentary filmmaker  Big money maker  And now  Yeah  And then you wonder why  Old guys are telling lawyer jokes  You know  Well she said that he promised  To give her half  She said they agreed  That if they ever broke up  They would just split it all in two  Because I'm sure Mick agreed to that verbally 
[03:14:00]  Yeah I'm sure  Yeah  Nice verbal agreement  Oh what do we got going on out there  I don't know  Some  VH1 people  VH1 people  VH1 people are here or something  Whatever  Is the whole Flava Flav thing  This big  Where we need the cameras and everything  I don't know  I understand  It's kind of a big hit there  On VH1  With the surreal life  And it's kind of cute  To watch  You know  Him trying to have sex  With that Amazon monster  What's her name  Bridget  Bridget Nielsen  Bridget Nielsen  Oh I saw that show 
[03:14:30]  The surreal life  Over the summer with them  Some entertainment news  Tell us about it  Yeah  It was a very interesting show  I think the best person  On that show  Was Ryan Starr  She was one of the  People there  That had the most talent  Why did she have  The most talent  Well first of all  And who's Ryan Starr  Ryan Starr  Is a female  Pop singer  Who's 21 years old  She's into rock and roll  Though  She's  A little young for this  But she knows the doors  And people like that  That she's really into  And I think

[03:17:00]  Is coming forward  Saying that this  Happened more recently  And the investigation  Is ongoing  I think the police  Are involved  They're checking it out  And they're saying  If the Cos  Has done some  Things that he  Probably shouldn't  Have been done  Right  So the latest  Accuser  They couldn't  Really get  On the news  Programs this morning  So they got  This other lady  That's coming forward  Yeah  And she's coming up  With some pretty  Crazy stuff  That Cosby supposedly  Did  Let's listen to  Tamara Green  Well there were  A number of people  At the table 
[03:17:30]  Friends of his  And he said to me  Yes you know  You do seem ill  You're slightly feverish  Would you like  To have some contact  So he went into  Some sort of  Office area  At the back of the  Restaurant  And he produced  Two capsules  In his hand  But I thought  Nothing of it  And I took  The capsules  In about  I don't know  20-30 minutes  I felt great  I'm telling you  And then  About 10 minutes  After that  I was almost  Literally face down  On the table  Of this restaurant  With the cars 
[03:18:00]  Coming up  With some dessert  From behind  I want to give you  Some contact  Not contact  Contact  Illegal contact  I have a pill  A red pill  And a green pill  Take one  And you wake up  In the matrix  Take another one  And I'll be  Doing you in the  Pooper over the table  In the restaurant  You know  She's an idiot  Why? 
[03:18:30]  Because he gave it  To her right at  The table  With everyone  And she's pretty much  She just can't  Handle her cold  Medicine  I've taken some  Of that stuff  We've talked about  The cold medicine  Thing and it  Should be illegal  You shouldn't be able  To just walk into  A drug store  And get this  Without a prescription  Some of it  Can really put you over  And if she had  Maybe a glass of wine  Or something  I don't know  You know  Of course she would  Have a reaction  Like that  If Kaz was going  To do something  He wouldn't be  Doing it right  In front of everyone  Like that  Right?  These are suppositories 
[03:19:00]  Is what they are  It's kind of  New suppositories  Let me put it  On my applicator  And put it  In your pooper  It's called contact  Alright  Well then she goes on here  He said  Oh my  You must be more ill  Than we believe  I totally lost  Motor control  I was almost  Unable to hold  My head up  I was very  Very  Very  Stoned  And he took me  Into my apartment  And then very  Helpfully  And nicely  Was prepared  To take off  My clothes 
[03:19:30]  And help me  Into bed  And pet me  And you know  And that's how  The actual assault  Began  Alright I'm back  In the game  I'm back  Alright I'm back  With you Tamara  Cause this is what  I love about  These type of cases  Where someone  Gets a little  Little woozy  From you know  Wobbly pops  And you always  Have to bring  Them home  And undress  Them  Why  How many times  Have you been  So hammered  You'll fall asleep  With your shoes  On in a bed  And it just  Doesn't matter  But the person  That is trying 
[03:20:00]  To help you  Has to make sure  You're completely  Naked in your own bed  There's no reason  If she can't  Keep her head up  She'll fall asleep  With her clothes on  I don't know  How many times  We've had  We've been in  That situation  Maybe in a frat house  Or down in spring  But what have you  And you just  Get the person  In their bed  With their shoes  And there you go  Put your head up  On this here  Put your mouth  Over this  This will keep  Your head up  But they always  Claim that they  Just want to  Make you comfortable  And take all  Your clothes off 
[03:20:30]  And make sure  You're under your sheets  With Rudy  I used to put her  To bed  And I'd take  Her little clothes off  And this is no different  Than just taking care  Of one of the  Huxtable kids  Now let me fondle  Your big seven  Deserve mama mom  I was petting it  Alright  Here's another clip  From Tamara Green  I didn't know  How sick I was  Or how stoned I was  But I slowly  Began to understand  That I had not 
[03:21:00]  Taken contact  The center of my being  Understood that  You know  He had gone  From helping me  To groping me  And kissing me  And touching me  And handling me  And you know  Taking off my clothes  Tell me more  Wow  You gotta love Cosby  The center of her  Yeah he realized  He had a drugged out  Girl there  And uh  He didn't go to town  What are you supposed  To do?  Give her the contact  Yeah  Take her to bed  Take her clothes off  Why any bitch  Has the sniffles 
[03:21:30]  This is what you get  Suck it up  Well  I don't know  What do you think?  You think he did this?  One more clip  Well I actually told him  That he would have to kill me  That if he didn't kill me  And he tried to rape me  It was going to go very badly  And I was furious  And I'm throwing things around  So he  Uh  You know  I guess it was inconvenient  At that point  I had not been crushed  Successfully into submission  And he  Um  He left  Two hundred dollar bills 
[03:22:00]  On my coffee table  Oof  And he left  My apartment  Here you go  Whore  Now this happened years ago  She's coming forward now  Yeah why now  Why now  Was it because she was scared  Thirty years  Is that what they're saying  This is like thirty years ago  Did she spend the money?  If she spent that two hundred  That's it  Maybe she had it until this time  Maybe it just finally ran out  She's frugal  I don't know 
[03:22:30]  I don't know about that  I don't know  It's kind of hard  After thirty years  To come forward  Well there's a lot of  Opportunists out there  You know  She's figuring  I could get some face time  Another opportunist  Is this Corey Feldman  He was on one of the  Programs this morning  I hope we get audio  For tomorrow  And now he's claiming  That now he's not sure  If Michael touched him or not  He's being subpoenaed  Back in 93 I guess  When the last case came aboard  He  They interviewed him  Because he's one of  Michael's little kid friends  Little buddies  When Corey was just a little kid 
[03:23:00]  And  And he went on record  Excuse me  In 93  Basically saying that  Nothing happened  Between him and Michael Jackson  Oh he was always saying  Like absolutely  But now  Do we have that audio  Did Steve get it or  They were  They had the guy down low  And they were doing voices  So it wasn't really worth  Is that a guess or no?  No  Okay  Wasn't worth playing  Oh because they didn't really  Have Corey speaking?  Yeah  But that's on tonight right?  Tomorrow night  Oh tomorrow night  Celebrity justice  Alright so we'll have the audio  But basically now  He's had time to think about it 
[03:23:30]  And really  Really think back  And now he's not really sure  Maybe I did get a dick in my ass  Hmm  Maybe that did happen  Wouldn't you know  If you had one in your face?  I think that's something  You kind of remember  That's probably something  That would stick out in your head  If Michael Jackson  Was having sex with you  Yeah  I don't think that slips your mind  Look I don't like Michael Jackson  Everyone knows I don't like him  But I gotta play devil's advocate here  Yeah  Did you see Stand By Me? 
[03:24:00]  Uh yeah  He looked kind of good  When he was crying  And talking about his father  Being a war hero  I mean how do you not  Just want to slip those little  Dungarees down  Was it that age?  Or was it the gremlins age?  Just uh  I don't remember him  From gremlins  Was he in gremlins?  Yeah  Like a little  Real little kid in that  Oh  And then he went through  The phase where he was  Dressing like Michael Jackson  He was really screwed up  At one point  You know something?  I might agree now  That it did happen  Because you know  He started dressing 
[03:24:30]  Like Michael Jackson  Wearing the hat  The glove  He was dancing around  He made a whole movie  Where he just acted  Like Michael Jackson  What was the movie called?  I don't remember  I was touched by Michael Jackson  I deny it  I'd like to have a copy  Of that movie  I think we could  Maybe enjoy that  Oof  I bet it's good  And I bet you'd be  A little harsh  Stop it  That Feldman kid was good  Oh you are the worst  You are lying  I hung out with that kid  One night  In one of Dice's hotel rooms  That kid came up  And hung out  Really?  Yeah  Real douche 
[03:25:00]  Did Dice touch him  Inappropriately?  Does Flavor Flay  And VH1  And everyone realize  That we're off the air  In like 15 minutes?
