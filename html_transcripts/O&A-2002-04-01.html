<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of the fallout from their April Fool's Day prank announcing the death of Boston Mayor Tom Menino.  This prank resulted in their indefinite suspension without pay from WAAF, and the Mayor's plans to file an FCC complaint and potentially sue.  Opie and Anthony discussed their firing, their decision not to apologize, and the ensuing media coverage. They reminisced about past April Fool's pranks, including a highly successful hoax involving a fake Pearl Jam concert at a fictional club called "Larky's," which attracted thousands. They contrasted their WAAF firing with their later successes, and fielded numerous calls from listeners sharing other radio station April Fool's Day pranks, including one where a classic rock station played Destiny's Child and another claiming an elephant was stuck in the Holland Tunnel.  The conversation also touched on the Pope's health and the movie *Blade II*.  The show mentioned upcoming broadcasts, including a live show from WBCN in Boston and their planned appearance on Jay Moore's ESPN show.  They also teased the impending loss of their show in two unnamed markets, later confirming this wasn't an April Fool's joke.  A visibly intoxicated Scott Farrell joined them for a conversation about baseball and other topics.

Next, a heavily intoxicated female guest, "Lady Di," celebrating her 40th birthday at Hooters, joined the show.  The conversation was highly vulgar and included Lady Di's attempts to deny her inebriation, a recap of a previous show where Pharrell Williams threw beer bottle openers into the audience, and numerous antagonistic phone calls from Ohio listeners (Cleveland and Columbus) filled with homophobic and geographically-based insults exchanged with the hosts.  They discussed various sports teams (New York Rangers, Islanders, Devils, Boston Bruins, and Philadelphia Flyers) and spent significant time planning their upcoming appearance on Jay Moore's "Moore Sports" show on ESPN.  This segment heavily involved brainstorming a skit where Opie and Anthony would give Jay Moore a massage, with increasingly absurd variations involving Ozzy Osbourne, Rakim, Slayer, Tara Reid, Cordell Stewart, Jeff Garcia, and Greg Louganis being proposed.  Humorous audio clips of sports announcers, such as Bob Murphy and Earl Weaver, were played throughout, and the show included a segment of "FU" messages from listeners.

A substantial portion of the broadcast focused on Jay Moore's wife's pregnancy via in-vitro fertilization.  The hosts and Jay engaged in crude humor regarding the process, employing vulgar terms and sexual innuendo surrounding sperm selection. They also discussed a rejected idea for a sports show opener featuring gay Broadway dancers.  The segment featured extensive criticism of their censor, "Craig," for excessively censoring their material, even when considered appropriate by the hosts. Opie's anger culminated in him throwing a microphone, narrowly missing a colleague and breaking a light bulb.  They debated various ways to address their issues with Craig, including firing him. A phone interview with Scott, owner of "sementest.com" (a service testing for semen in panties), further fueled sexually explicit humor and wordplay.  They also discussed the show's cancellation in two cities, more "F.U." calls, and a news story about a young man's suicide allegedly linked to EverQuest addiction, prompting personal anecdotes about their own gaming experiences.  The segment concluded with Babe Ruth audio.


The final segment delved into listener calls discussing the MMORPG EverQuest.  The hosts discussed game mechanics, including crafting items (arrows, potions), in-game currency generation, equipment acquisition, subscription costs, and the potential for indefinite playtime.  The discussion shifted to EverQuest's addictive nature, referencing the news story about the player's suicide. This sparked a debate about the game's impact, the responsibility of players and families, and several callers shared their experiences, including one who quit their job to play for four months and another who played for 72.5 hours straight.  Callers also discussed selling high-level characters on eBay and the social aspects, including guild participation. One caller mentioned encountering German-speaking players they identified as Nazis.  The hosts briefly discussed other violent video games (Kingpin, Grand Theft Auto) and the ongoing debate about their societal impact.  The segment concluded with speculation about the show's cancellation in two radio markets, initially presented as a potential April Fool's joke, with some uncertainty remaining about its truth.  Listeners called in with their thoughts, anecdotes, and opinions, and the show ended with a "What Do We Learn" segment summarizing listener feedback and jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Boston Mayor Tom Menino thankfully is alive and well, contrary to a radio station so-called April Fool's Joke.  WAAF DJs Opie and Anthony had announced on the air the mayor was killed in a car accident in Florida.  Tom Menino is very much alive and not at all amused.  It was an April Fool's Joke, albeit a tasteless one.  But you know, some of the listeners actually found him very funny and I do want to state that because we're getting a lot of, you know, flack that it was just, you know, shocking. 
[00:00:30]  There is some comedic value to it.  Now the mayor plans to file a complaint to the FCC and he may even sue the radio station.  WAAF management says they've offered to let the mayor throw pies in the DJ's faces to raise money for charity,  but tonight Opie and Anthony told me they will not go along with that.  What? What? What? What?  This is where it gets stupid.  You think saying the mayor was dead was crossing the line, huh?  Uh, yeah, yeah.  I just, I just, I feel bad that the mayor's, you know, wife heard it. 
[00:01:00]  Who knew that the mayor's family is fans of the Opie and Anthony show?  Tom Menino was very upset.  Adding to his anger was the fact that the on-air personalities never apologize.  We apologize to the mayor.  Never apologize.  I am sorry, mayor.  I will not accept the apology this time.  I am sorry, mayor.  Opie and Anthony killed Menino.  What?  Opie and Anthony killed Menino.  This is gonna get you fired.  I am sorry, mayor.  You make me sick, you fat sack of crap. 
[00:01:30]  The station initially tried to parlay this incident into a publicity stunt.  Station owners did take the situation very seriously and today, they acted.  Opie and Anthony repeatedly announced that Mayor Tom Menino had been killed in a car crash.  Now WAAF has suspended the DJs indefinitely without pay.  Mayor Menino is also seeking sanctions from the Federal Communications Commission.  Aw.  We're kicking.  Today, Opie and Anthony were gone.  Fired.  Opie and Anthony are on SLOA tonight. 
[00:02:00]  Opie and Anthony have been terminated.  Fired.  And that looks like the last you're gonna hear from either of these DJs for a while.  And if the former WAAF afternoon drive duo are looking for sympathy, they better not look on the streets of Boston.  I agree with it.  I think they should have been fired, absolutely.  I think they should have been fired.  It's like someone saying that to my mom and dad.  Opie and Anthony are off the air for good.  Losers.  Opie and Anthony have been fired.  It was all just a joke.  Opie and Anthony delivered the joke on April Fool's Day. 
[00:02:30]  But the punchline knocked them right out of Boston radio.  They're dead air as far as their radio show is concerned.  That's no joke.  The station's keeping kind of a low profile as a couple of its top DJs go to no profile.  Instead of delivering jokes, Opie and Anthony are going to be delivering audition tapes.  Mayor Menino had no comment on that tonight, but in the statement he said...  Hopefully this incident will give all broadcasters pause.  Pause.  Pause.  When they make statements which are...  Fault if irresponsible.  Piss off. 
[00:03:00]  Opie and Anthony killed Menino.  We killed the mayor of Boston.  We've gone after them.  Opie and Anthony.  We're nobody's bitch.  Anyone can get a joke anymore!  Yeah.  Wait, what?  Suck it!  Yes!  Suck it!  Ha ha!  We always win in the end.  It looked pretty grim back then, Opie.  How many years ago?  That was 16 years ago, I believe. 
[00:03:30]  Four years ago today.  Yes.  Our old station WAF and Dave Dickless.  Yes.  Turned their backs on Opie and Anthony.  Turned their backs.  Boy, Dave Dickless, at the time it seemed like the thing to do, didn't it?  Save your own ass and hang us out to dry, not defend us, not try to do whatever was possible to keep us.  And look at what happened.  Oh, you had a couple of fun little years there, didn't you?  Yeah. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, you had fun living off our success, but oh boy, have things changed.  Things have changed a little in those four years, right?  Yeah, Dave and a lot of other people out there need to know Opie and Anthony always win in the end.  Always.  Always.  It might look grim at certain points.  Certain situations might look like, uh-oh, boy, such and such got the best of them this time.  Uh-uh.  Because when it all comes out in the wash, we end up back, better than ever, in Boston, 
[00:04:30]  kicking the ass of the people responsible for throwing us out of there.  How about those stupid newscasters?  Yeah.  Instead of delivering jokes, they'll be delivering demo tapes.  Demo tapes.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Go after yourselves.  We had a job a week later.  And here it is.  April Fools 2002, Opie. 
[00:05:00]  Let the record state, we haven't done an April Fools joke since.  No.  I mean, how are you going to top that?  Until we figure out how to top that, we're not doing one.  I'm not doing one.  Until I get that phone call in the morning while I'm all groggy.  I wake up and Opie's on the phone going, Ant, I got a great idea for an April Fools joke.  Well, okay, Opie.  Whatever you think.  I'll be in and we'll do it.  Whatever.  You know.  You got some common sense.  That's okay.  Yeah, sure. 
[00:05:30]  We'll go.  Greatness.  It certainly did.  Our careers started four years ago today, my friend.  Our real careers.  Uh-huh.  You know, the minor leagues was all fun and dandy.  Right.  And we had a good time doing it for a while.  You got to craft your trade somewhere, you know?  So, we will not be doing an April Fools prank today.  Sorry.  There was a time that we really enjoyed doing April Fools pranks, but now every radio station  in America does them.  So, I mean, everyone is expecting it and they're all silly and stupid and we don't want to be 
[00:06:00]  a part of it anymore.  They're so bad.  Is this true?  Oh, my God.  What?  I just have an announcement about Mayor Bloomberg.  No.  It seemed...  What?  He wasn't hit by a ball at Shea Stadium?  No, no.  Oh, okay.  No, he's fine.  He's fine?  Okay.  We think.  He's never around.  I believe he was sitting with Mayor Giuliani and they were tongue kissing.  That's...  And that's not an April Fools gag.  I don't know what happened there.  Ah, here they come. 
[00:06:30]  People calling in already with some of the April Fools pranks they've heard on the radio  today already.  Let me warm this up.  Jeff, what's going on?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on, Jeff.  Oh!  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on, Jeff.  We've got to start over because program was not down today.  What number was that supposed to be?  No number.  Just program wasn't down.  Program down.  PGM wasn't down.  Okay.  Is that a joke?  Go ahead, Jeff.  No.  Okay.  Update on the crazy chicanery.  Scotzo played Beyonce from Destiny's Child. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, he did?  Oh, what a crazy.  He was like, bird dead.  And Destiny's Child.  Wait, Scotzo on the classic rock station played Destiny's Child.  That was his April Fools break today?  Yeah.  It fooled me.  It made me go wacky.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you for that.  All right.  That's a little wacky.  I heard a couple on the way in.  I heard a couple.  We'll talk about it.  Let me just give the phone numbers out because people want to get in with what they've heard  on the radio today.  In New York, 877-692-1027. 
[00:07:30]  Anywhere else, including, of course, Boston today, Anthony.  Yeah.  As a matter of fact, we'll be broadcasting live from WBCN on Friday.  Hoping a lot of people hang out outside the station.  That's always a good time.  Yeah.  We'll be handing out wow stickers like crazy wow right around the effing corner.  Oh, you have a day like this today?  Stop by BCN Friday to get your wow stickers, okay?  Yeah.  For Boston and anyone else outside of New York, 866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW.  We should tell people, we did many April Fools pranks. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  The mayor one was the last one we did.  Uh-huh.  But we're most proud of the one we did the year before the mayor prank.  Would that one involve a club named Larky's?  Larky's.  Very good.  Very proud of that prank we pulled, and no one remembers it because we outdid ourselves  with the mayor's dead thing.  Yeah.  But we had thousands of people show up for a Pearl Jam show.  It was a live Pearl Jam, one of those last-minute announced concerts where Pearl Jam was playing 
[00:08:30]  at a place called Larky's.  Figure it out.  Larky's.  It was right there.  Where was it?  Right on the Mass, New Hampshire border?  Well, is that what we said?  I forgot what town we said.  If someone comes up with it, I'll remember.  Yeah.  Matter of fact, if you come up with a town that we said Pearl Jam was going to perform  at over the border in New Hampshire, we'll give you a prize today, okay?  Wow.  And we had thousands of people show up.  Thousands.  The town was free.  Well, let me tell you something.  If I remember right, the town didn't really exist. 
[00:09:00]  We said it was near this town.  Right.  We gave a fake town and said it's right next to this town.  This town.  And this town that we said was a real town.  So we had about a thousand, at least a thousand people just kind of circling around this really  tiny town.  Asking everyone for directions.  Trying to find this place called Larky's.  Because we kept going into the production studio, blasting live Pearl Jam in the background,  and doing reports from the club like, wow, the people are really filing in.  If you want to get in on this exclusive Pearl Jam show, you better show up now. 
[00:09:30]  It's not too late.  It's not too late.  There's very limited seating, though, so you've really got to get here.  And people were just going crazy, driving all the way up there, and there was no show.  The place was called Larky's.  It pissed people off.  It was a multi-level club, remember?  Because they always said it was Larky's was on the first floor.  It was the rock club.  The next floor was Larky's.  Larky's.  It was a black club.  And then there was a country bar.  Yeah, I forgot the name.  Right above it. 
[00:10:00]  I forget the name of the country one.  Larky's and Larky's.  That was classic.  Yeah.  Classic, classic stuff.  And that really pissed a lot of people off.  They're like, dude, I'm up here.  I can't find a place.  And then we said, you know, well, we've got to outdo ourselves.  We came up with the mayor thing the next floor.  Yeah, that was a great idea.  But boy, that's all Opie, by the way.  I want everyone to know.  What?  I had nothing to do with the mayor thing.  I was along for that awful ride.  It was a great ride.  Yeah, they got a great idea.  What? 
[00:10:30]  Let's just say the mayor died.  What is?  What is?  Um, all right-o.  And then right when it came out of your mouth.  That day, April Fool's Day, four years ago.  The second it came out of your mouth, you gave me a look like, uh-oh, maybe that wasn't  such a good idea.  And what?  An hour later, cops, they're already doing news stories all over Boston.  Yeah, it was bad.  They're scrolling going, the mayor's not dead.  It's a horrible April Fool's prank that a radio station pulled in.  Oh, it was bad.  Then we had camera crews following us around for, what, a week straight? 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  At least?  Mm-hmm.  And then Dave Dickless and the rest of the gang over there at AF just turning their backs  on us.  Payback's a bitch, my friends.  Right.  What, you thought we were just going to go away forever?  All right.  So, no pranks for us today.  Don't send me fake CNN pages.  Look at this guy.  It's CNN.com, but then it's got at and a bunch of numbers and slash and stuff. 
[00:11:30]  It says, uh, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates murdered.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Aren't people expecting stuff today?  I know.  It's ridiculous.  The internet now has just made it so easy to scam people.  No one is going to pull the big prank this year.  I'm guaranteed.  Jim, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  I'm just curious, you know, why you guys did an opening show today with Sandy and Anthony's  girlfriend?  That would have been a pretty funny prank.  What, radio stations are doing that?  Oh, yeah.  What's that about? 
[00:12:00]  Oh.  As a matter of fact, the show comes on before you started that today.  It was pretty disgusting.  What, instead of doing, instead of the regular hosts being on, they have their wives?  It was all the wives.  There you go.  No, I don't believe any show did that, sir.  No lie.  Jim, that's the oldest gag in the world, and it's horrible.  It was awful on the ears.  All right.  Well, good for them.  Take it easy, guys.  All right, Jim.  Did you guys hear the Queen Mum died?  No, I'm just kidding.  Oh, she did. 
[00:12:30]  The Queen Mum.  All right.  Here come all the bad radio April Fool's pranks.  People are calling like crazy now.  Gary, what's going on?  You're next on the OPNN show.  Hey, how are you doing?  All right.  Hey, on the Spanish...  Hold on.  Excuse me.  Is this 14-year-old Gary?  Yes, it is.  Ah, 14-year-old Gary.  14-year-old Gary makes a return to the show.  Hello.  And he's got some material.  Hey, Norton.  Hi, Gary.  On the Spanish radio station in the morning.  Today?  Yeah, today.  They were saying that an elephant got loose from the Ringley Brothers and Marlene Bailey 
[00:13:00]  and got stuck in the Holland Tunnel, and they had all complete traffic.  Ho, ho!  Hey, there's a...  You people...  Look, you're not going to believe this.  I'm looking at the news right now, and it seems an elephant from the circus has gotten  loose and he's stuck in the Holland Tunnel.  Please use the Lincoln Tunnel or the GWB.  I got...  Oh, no, there's a pterodactyl on the GWB.  Gary, were people calling and believing it?  C.  Huh?  People were believing it.  They're like, oh, so what can I do now? 
[00:13:30]  And they were calling the radio station to see what other route they could use to get  to their job.  If it was on the Spanish station, just sit down and have more children until it clears  out.  And that's the real April Fool's joke that actually some of their listeners are going  to work.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Who saw that?  Nice one.  That was a nice one.  Alright, 14-year-old Gary, very good phone call.  You were prepared.  You did well.  You had material and everything.  Very good.  14-year-old Gary.  I think we might have to reconsider 14-year-old Gary.  Thank you. 
[00:14:00]  I never thought he was off the show or anything.  I listen to you every day.  Thank you.  Alright, bye.  Hey, Gary, are we corrupting you?  No.  Bill O'Reilly says we are.  Yes.  He's a dumbass.  Alright, thank you.  Alright, bye.  Bye.  Corruption of America's children.  Ugh.  The American.  But why make a special no one can remember the name of even people that were on it?  Oh, and a little message to the Christian mom that wrote me.  Go F yourselves.  Ouch.  You've got two lines of your letter and hit delete.  Where on?  I don't care. 
[00:14:30]  Dude, I love reading those.  They're the greatest.  I don't care.  I love those holy rollers.  Because they're covering up with some magical spirit.  And she started the letter with inadequacies in their own lives.  She started the letter with, I know you don't care or you're not going to read this whole thing, but...  And that's all I...  But.  That's all I read.  Okay.  Michael.  See you later.  I watched some holy rollers there on, I guess, Saturday.  It was in a hotel.  I'm sitting there.  Going through the channels and there's this man and woman, don't know their name or anything. 
[00:15:00]  You felt like you needed to find religion, Anthony, with the week we had last week?  Yeah.  That was it.  Believe me.  No.  I was just...  I had to stop.  And they're so into God that it's beyond me.  It's like there's no way they don't have an ulterior motive.  There's no way human beings can be this into God.  And they're talking like...  And they're holding hands.  It's a husband and wife team.  And everything the husband says, she's just like, oh, yes, praise God.  Praise Jesus. 
[00:15:30]  Praise.  Oh, that's the word of the Lord.  Amen.  Amen.  And you just can't picture them doing anything else but 24 hours a day.  It's God and Jesus.  And that doesn't seem like a fun life.  No.  So we take it to the other extreme.  You know, where, you know, Satan, hell, sex, debauchery.  Speaking of God, did you see Robo-Pope over the weekend?  Oh, oh.  We've joked about this in the past, but now it's a reality.  They just put the thing in his hand and let him, like, bless the crowd?  Uh, like a priest, he gets up on the pulpit. 
[00:16:00]  The pulpit?  Yeah.  It's a pulpit, right?  The pulpit.  He was on a mechanical pulpit.  What?  Where he kind of went and moved forward.  Out into the crowd like Tommy Lee's drum set?  Yeah, pretty much.  Was the Pope spinning upside down and doing circles with strobe lights on him?  Because the Parkinson's is really, uh...  Oh, yeah.  Really taking over now.  Hey, God, thank you.  Yeah.  Here's a guy that dedicated his whole life to you, and what do you do?  You return the favor by giving him Parkinson's.  Isn't that proof enough when a church ceiling collapsed on the congregation and things like 
[00:16:30]  that happen?  The Holy Rollers have truly dedicated themselves to God, and they just have these horrid deaths.  Good job, God.  The Pope gave up BJ's, and this is how you return the favor.  He can't even sleep at night.  He's shaking so much that it keeps him awake.  Good job.  Good job, God.  You know, at the Vatican, he's, you know, give us a little speech there, a little sermon,  whatever he does.  And all they do, he sits there, he doesn't even move.  He could be dead. 
[00:17:00]  The only way you know he's not dead is that one hand is just shaking like crazy.  And they put this thing in his hand, I guess, to bless the crowd with.  And all of a sudden, you know, his hand starts moving a little bit.  He shakes it, and then it's back to his side again.  Robo-Pope.  Robo-Pope.  The poor bastard.  They had this wild thing set up for him, and it just moved forward, moved around.  And at one point, he was the young, vibrant Pope.  Remember that?  Mm-hmm. 
[00:17:30]  When he first was elected to Pope?  And he was like the young guy.  He's like, wow, that's the young Pope relating to the younger generation.  Ah, now he's just some fossil sitting there.  I wait for one of his arms to just crack off.  Poor bastard.  I don't think he ever related to the younger generation.  You're acting like he was Jimmy Page 20 years ago.  He was still 70 and said, whacking your bag is wrong.  No.  When he was young, dude, he's 81 now.  He's been the Pope forever.  Pretty much our whole lives.  He was like, relatively speaking, the young Pope. 
[00:18:00]  As far as Popes go, he was young at the time.  And he kind of had some newer ideas.  Not like he was saying, you know, go crank it into a homo's face or nothing, you know.  No, he don't say that.  That's still taboo.  He just says, yes, you can be a priest.  That's pretty much the same thing as saying that.  I love the Lord.  Here's my son.  Go ahead.  Crinkle, crinkle.  Get in the bag and the confessional.  Hold on a second.  Music interlude. 
[00:18:30]  Music interlude.  That's what I said, didn't I?  Yeah.  When he rolls up the seas, he ain't just putting on the ritz.  Our God is an awesome God.  There's thunder in his perception, lightning in his fist.  Our God is an awesome God.  And the Lord wasn't joking when he kicked him out of people.  It wasn't for no reason that he shed his blood.  His return is very close, and so you better be believing that our God is an awesome God.  Awesome.  Our Garrett is an awesome Garrett. 
[00:19:00]  Our Steve is a thinner Steve.  And the new one.  Our Earl is a lazy Earl.  Look at Jimmy starting something on our show.  We got three now. 
[00:19:30]  Where is Earl? Is he in today?  Yeah, he's in a bad mood.  I saw Earl's movie over the weekend, Blade 2, starring Earl.  Earl.  He's all dressed in black.  He's got the sunglasses on all the time.  Only he was like, you know, full of energy.  If Earl was Blade, he'd be dead in two seconds into the movie.  Oh, go F yourself.  Head gone.  What a great goddamn movie.  You like the Blade 2?  You've got to see Blade 2.  The fight scenes in this thing, unbelievable. 
[00:20:00]  The effects are great when he uses the silver, whether it's a bullet or...  He hops on the back of a motorcycle at the beginning of the movie.  He's got like one of those, you know, the piano string kind of thing that you choke someone with.  And it's made of silver.  You know, silver vampires that kind of just disintegrate.  Puts it around the guy's neck and just pulls, and the guy just falls apart.  Great, brutal fight scenes.  Brutal.  Arms just busting.  Swords.  Lots of death.  Gunfire.  Everything I want in a movie. 
[00:20:30]  Blade 2.  Take that, Bill O'Reilly.  It's great.  Lots of kids are there, too.  All right, Mike.  Watching the violence.  What's up?  My two favorite crackers.  What's going on, brother?  What's up?  You boys are going straight to hell.  You know black people know God personally.  So I talked to him just now, and you're going straight to hell.  Did you talk to black Jesus?  Well, no.  You all know Jesus was black.  Why are we going to hell for stating the truth?  Well, hey, listen.  Now, first of all, the whole thing with the...  If you're God, why would you give the Pope Parkinson's?  The Pope need Parkinson's to keep him grounded, you know? 
[00:21:00]  Keep him grounded?  What's the Pope doing?  Hey, the Pope, well, hey, look what his boys is doing.  You talk about a guy that probably lived a perfect life, and this is how you repay him?  You think he lived his perfect life.  Uh-uh.  No, no, no, no.  No man is a bugger.  No, my brother.  Parkinson's is hell on earth, my friend.  Hey, but you don't know what he did before, you know, he got to Parkinson's.  You look at all his boys is doing.  What could he have done?  He's the Pope.  All right, Dad, what you don't think?  What you think, man? 
[00:21:30]  Come on, think about it.  He's the Pope, got all them little boys around.  All his boys is doing the way.  Why don't he?  All right, all right.  No, no, no, no.  Go away.  Hold up.  Let's be for real.  Come on, now.  Let's be for real.  Yeah, let's be for real.  And I just talked to a guy.  He told me the whole story.  You know, the Pope.  What?  This ain't going anywhere.  Why?  It was a good try, though.  Sorry.  Thank you.  All right, let's get back to some of the pranks some of the other radio stations are doing  today.  Steve, what's going on?  Oh, and hey, you guys rock. 
[00:22:00]  Where are you calling from, bro?  Hey, I'm calling from Columbus.  Believe it or not, you're still on the air here.  Yeah.  Well, we're going to be off the air in a few markets very soon.  Well, I hope not here.  You guys are awesome.  Will one of the markets be Columbus?  No.  Stay tuned to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, you guys.  Two of our affiliates will be leaving us very soon.  Oh, I hope it's not us, man.  And one affiliate moving us up.  Yes.  There you go.  Syndication news coming soon to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  All right, go ahead.  Check it out.  You guys were talking Friday about the Underground Mall. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, that's a big one that radio stations pull every day.  Yeah.  The Underground Mall.  Someone in Columbus did that?  No.  I was coming back from Michigan yesterday rolling through Detroit and I was scanning  through and they heard them talking about the Underground Carnival.  I was like, God damn, listen to that.  O.P. and Anthony were right.  Underground Carnival.  Underground Carnival.  Right.  That is having its grand opening today of all days, right?  Yes.  They were secretly building this for over a year underground.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:23:00]  Exactly.  That's exactly what they were saying.  They were going to be broadcasting live from it.  Oh, God.  You guys hit it right on the head.  Right on, bro.  Hey, I'm trying to spread the word here, boys.  Keep up the good work.  Thank you.  Could Columbus be one of the affiliates that will be leaving us soon?  I hope not.  I'll have to be moving.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  All right.  Norton rules.  Bye.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Chris.  Hey, Chris, what's going on?  All right.  You guys can take all the calls you want today, but what's the deal?  What are you setting us up for as a gag?  I know you've got something going on. 
[00:23:30]  No.  No.  No.  Well, I'm going to listen to the rest of the day, but I know you're going to pull something  out at the end of the day.  No.  I don't want to be honest with you guys.  No.  Yeah.  We don't want any part of the April Fool's pranks anymore.  Because you guys are so honest.  No, we're not honest, but we're just telling you like it is today.  You'll see by 7 o'clock.  All right.  It's leaving, huh?  You'll see.  Something's going to happen.  All right.  Nothing is happening today, because every radio station in America now does it.  The one guy hung up, and that's always a good one.  Hey, people, just letting you know, your $20 bills are not going to be accepted any longer. 
[00:24:00]  You cannot use $20 bills anymore.  So you have to go to the bank and change them for two tenths.  Yeah.  People buy this stuff.  People go to the banks and, you know, hey, I heard the 20s aren't good anymore.  What kind of fool?  Did you hear a couple on the way in, you said?  Just quick ones, like that people had been fired at the station. 
[00:24:30]  And then a quick, April Fool's.  Like, oh, right, right.  Hey, I just want to let everybody know, I got engaged over the weekend.  April Fool's.  Oh, sorry.  I got one.  Rich Voss killed last night.  No one will believe that.  I heard the replay of that over the weekend. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  We do a replay show on Saturdays here in New York.  God damn, was that funny.  Rich Voss, the first white guy on Def Comedy Jam.  Bill, what's going on?  Hey, O&A.  Hey.  What's going on?  Up here in Orange County, New York, the local Q104 was claiming that due to bad weather  in Florida, the space shuttle was going to be diverting into Stewart Airport in Newburgh,  New York.  And they had people lined up with cameras and binoculars sitting on top of the cars waiting 
[00:25:30]  for you to watch the space shuttle come through the clouds.  Ho, ho.  Wow.  And they also tried to pull the New York State legislation just passed the no smoking and  driving law.  Don't get caught smoking and driving.  $50 fine.  On this April 1st?  Right.  Check your calendars, folks.  Isn't that awful?  Thank you, Bill.  Yeah, you got it.  The only thing worse than the stations doing it are the God damn rubes that would listen  and do that.  The shills.  Whenever you watch those shows and you see people that get taken for money or whatever, 
[00:26:00]  you realize and you look and say, how stupid do you have to be to fall for that?  You realize that on April 1st when people just fall for those stupid things.  Go to the bank and exchange your 20s.  Hi, I'm here with all of my $20 bills.  I want 10s for them.  So why are they stopping accepting the 20s?  No, they're not.  They're not, idiot.  I heard on the radio, oh, perhaps they were doing an April Fool's. 
[00:26:30]  No.  No.  They would never do that to me.  You jackass.  No, don't give me 20s.  They're not accepted anymore.  Let me give you a fist in your face.  You know what's a good little prank I like to play on April Fool's?  I like to get a gal and have sex and then say, no, no, no.  You won't start losing weight soon.  April Fool's.  April Fool's, you have the hiv.  Jason from Cleveland, what's going on? 
[00:27:00]  What's up, fellas?  You guys definitely rule.  We definitely represent Ohio here.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on, hold on.  Let me say something here.  What?  Will Cleveland be one of the radio stations leaving the Opie and Anthony Network?  Better not.  92.3, definitely hope not.  Hold on.  One city listening to us right now will be leaving the Opie and Anthony Network.  Very, very soon.  Listening right now?  Right now.  Better not be Seatown.  We represent, definitely.  We got a prank coming in today about they were calling these husbands and wives at work. 
[00:27:30]  It was terrible, saying people are dying and all those others.  You know, the old school prank.  Terrible.  Radio station, you guys are on it right now.  We're doing it.  What were they doing?  Calling up their husbands and wives at work, saying they're dying.  It was stupid.  That's pretty funny, actually.  It is pretty funny, but the way they were doing it.  That's actually not bad.  It was pretty good, but the way they were doing it was terrible.  They were calling these people and they were, you know, not disguising their voices.  So the guys were like, oh, I don't think this is true.  Oh, really?  Terrible.  But anyway, could you guys hook me up with a shirt and you guys autograph it? 
[00:28:00]  Because you guys have to represent out here.  Yeah, hold on.  We'll figure something out.  All right.  You guys rule.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Will New York be one of the cities that will not be picking up the Opie and Anthony show  anymore?  Geez.  I hope so.  I hear there's two that are going bye-bye very soon.  Really?  Frank, what's going on?  Hey, I just wanted to let Anthony know that I officially joined his club.  What?  I had my first menage a trois. 
[00:28:30]  My club?  Is it a club now?  It's a club.  All right, listen.  Yeah.  April Fool's.  Ah.  Ah, there you go.  Hey, listen.  Hey, Norton.  Never going to work, sir.  No, let's go to Steve.  Especially not today.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  You're in soap.  Norton.  I was listening to a station here on Long Island this morning.  And they had Moby on.  And Moby was on all morning saying, I bought the station for $2.3 million and I fired everybody. 
[00:29:00]  But I'm going to sell it back now for $2.3 and one.  Hey, I didn't make up the joke.  Oh, I know.  You did a very good job relaying it, though.  Yeah, we felt equally as bored with it.  Yeah.  Thank you, Steve.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  They had one in Buffalo.  I love being syndicated.  We can find out what everyone else is doing.  Alex, what's up? 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, the radio station here in Buffalo.  Which one?  Uh, W-E-D-G.  Used to be Fox.  Oh, okay.  Mm-hmm.  They were, uh, in the morning, they were, uh, running something that a guy from Microsoft  brought the Buffalo Sabres and was moving them out to Seattle.  Ho-ho!  And...  I bet the whole city was outraged!  Did they get outraged callers on the phone?  No, they got...  Hey!  Oop!  Oop!  Oop! 
[00:30:00]  Oop!  Oop!  You know, the site they gave was, like, complete bogus.  It's like, you know, we got our information at bookdrop.com, you know.  Hmm.  You know, that site doesn't exist.  All right.  You know, another thing they give it away is they're gonna rename the team the Seattle  Super Sabres, you know.  Oy.  All right.  Thank you, Alex.  All right, see ya.  Bye.  You know, what's really cute and funny is, and it's kinda hard to do, but if you work  in a hospital, and if someone happens to have a baby that, you know, is stillborn... 
[00:30:30]  Uh-huh.  It's really funny if you hand it to them and go here, and they go, ah, then you go, ah,  I'm kidding, it's dead.  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  Oh, God!  Very near future.  Mmm.  I wonder if you're responsible.  Tom, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, um, I got news for Norton.  I just got the last two tickets to the town hall show. 
[00:31:00]  Never gonna work, sir.  It's true!  No, it's not.  I know how many there are.  Ah, you suck.  I know it.  You rock.  All right.  He was trying to do a little April Fools gag on ya.  A little April Fools.  All right, why don't we take our first break?  Mm-hmm.  We have lots to do today.  Scott Farrell is outside the studio.  Hammered.  It is opening day, so we can speak a little baseball today, I guess.  Also, I guess Lady Di is hammered.  Well, he was doing an event. 
[00:31:30]  A little event after a show over at Hooters.  And, you know, they got beer over there.  So, he was drinking some.  Lady Di was.  So, I hear.  She's hammered.  She's snotted.  It's her birthday today, too.  She's one of the most obnoxious drunks.  I remember.  There was a gig.  Where the hell were we that day?  Where Lady Di.  Bar 9.  Oh, it was Bar 9.  And Lady Di was drunk.  And I wanted to punch her in the face.  But I knew I couldn't punch hard enough. 
[00:32:00]  I didn't have the strength in me to punch her as hard as I truly wanted to.  And I hear she's just as tanked.  And the only thing I was saying at Bar 9 that night was, I just wish this was on the air.  I wish she was this drunk on the air.  So, good.  You get a little...  Is she here yet, Keith?  I'm going to go outside and check, but I had her about three pitches deep on the stairs.  Oh, good.  And she claims she doesn't drink much anymore.  She claims she doesn't drink much.  She goes, don't be here.  Shovel her up off the sidewalk.  Yeah, let's get her up here.  Bring her in.  She thinks like a champ. 
[00:32:30]  Scott Farrell.  Also, Anthony, more people calling to tell us what their local radio shows were doing for today.  April Fools.  And we're going to get Jay Moore on the phone.  Hopefully...  Oh, that's when he can call in?  He's filming.  All right.  A little later on, Jay Moore is going to call in.  His Moore Sports starts tomorrow night on ESPN.  Yes.  And you don't even know this yet, Anthony.  He called me at home after the show Friday.  Yeah.  He has an idea for you and I.  He wants us to be part of his show. 
[00:33:00]  Well, he wants us to...  More Sports?  Yeah, he wants us to tape an opening with him.  An opening?  He wants to fly us out to Hollywood.  Hollywood.  And we would film...  We would film this great opening with Jay Moore to start one of his Moore Sports on ESPN.  All right.  Do you know what the idea is?  Oh, yeah.  And I'm not going to tell you because you've got to hear it.  You're not telling me.  You've got to hear it from his mouth.  Okay.  I don't want to spoil the reaction you will have for him.  Is it funny?  I was laughing so effing hard and for all the wrong reasons. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, it's not funny?  I don't want to give too much away.  It's ridiculous.  All right.  But he had me laughing so hard, I don't know.  I thought I was going to stop breathing.  That's how ridiculous this idea is.  In a good and a bad way.  Now I'm very curious.  Well, I know.  But I can't tell you because it'll ruin the surprise for you.  Does he have you each dressing up as an affiliate and leaving?  Oh. 
[00:34:00]  Kevin from D.C.  What's going on?  Hey, this is Kevin from Heaven.  I was just wondering, you guys aren't getting canceled down here, are you?  Will D.C. be one of the cities dropping the Opie and Anthony show in the very near future?  Hmm.  The answer is going to surprise some people too.  Please tell me that.  It ain't so.  Thank you, Kevin.  Thank you.  Hmm.  Two cities dropping the show.  Why would you want to drop this program?  Can't sell it. 
[00:34:30]  Is that it?  See, because when you're in charge of the station and you can't sell it, you just assume that it's a bad show.  Wrong.  No, you're a retard and you've got a room full of retards trying to sell the damn thing.  Right.  The answer will surprise you.  All right.  In New York, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else outside of New York, including Boston today, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  Big day for us.  It's like a national holiday for us, April Fool's.  Right. 
[00:35:00]  866-277-4WOW.  Don't forget, this Friday we broadcast live from WBCN for Norton Show in Boston.  Mm-hmm.  And we love when people hang out outside the station and drink, party.  We'll be handing out all sorts of stuff, okay?  Hell yeah.  All right.  It's about as funny as a sinking school bus.  I have a strong stomach.  You guys made me blow chunks.  I'm great.  The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life.  ONA, my two new favorite whores.  You guys are really horrible.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  What a couple of ass wipes. 
[00:35:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oi.  It's April Fool's Day.  Yeah.  We are not doing a prank.  No.  People don't believe we're not doing a prank.  No.  This is what sucks about today.  One guy seems to think that at some point we're just gonna play dead air and everybody  will then think that their market was one that was taken off. 
[00:36:00]  That Opie and Anthony Show was dropped from.  No.  Two cities are gonna be really surprised when they realize they just lost the Opie and Anthony  Show and it wasn't an April Fool's prank.  Yeah.  We're not saying, you know, today.  In the very near future though.  Yeah.  I swear to you.  I don't swear often.  Two cities are dropping the Opie and Anthony Show in the very near future.  Don't have to swear on something.  It's not an April Fool's prank.  I know.  Whatever.  It's not a prank and soon enough you'll find out for yourselves, okay? 
[00:36:30]  Right.  Uh, Gabe is panicking though.  Gabe, what's going on?  Gabe!  Hello.  What's up, Gabe?  Oh, hey, uh, Buffalo's gonna dump you, aren't they?  Who?  Buffalo.  Buffalo?  92.9.  WBUF.  WBUF.  Will Buffalo be one of the cities dropping the Opie and Anthony Show?  Stay tuned for the answer.  It ain't happening today.  No, yeah.  Obviously.  I'm listening to you.  Maybe as soon as tomorrow though. 
[00:37:00]  Well, that's possible.  I hope not.  Alright, Gabe.  Thank you.  Alright.  Speaking of Buffalo, Tony writes,  Buffalo better not lose O&A.  We've already lost four Super Bowls, a Stanley Cup, and any sort of successful economy.  We need something to brighten our miserable, snow-infested lives.  Ha, ha, ha.  Tony, you're funny, man.  No, I'm not giving that hint.  We do have to give props to Tim Sabian today, though.  Tim.  Tim.  Yes. 
[00:37:30]  The program director of WYSP in Philadelphia.  Mm-hmm.  The first program director to believe in us outside of New York.  Yes.  He now runs WCKG in Chicago, Anthony.  In Chicago.  And guess what?  I know.  He's been on the job less than a week.  Yeah.  He's already moved the Opie and Anthony Show down.  Mm-hmm.  He's not going to be on in the middle of the night in Chicago anymore.  No.  And that is not an April Fool's prank either.  No.  I think we're on 7 to 11 now, right after Steve Dahl in Chicago.  Right.  There you go.  And I'm hearing Steve Dahl giving us props lately, so thank you, Steve. 
[00:38:00]  There you go, Chicago.  Tim Sabian getting right down to business in Chicago.  He's a no-nonsense kind of guy.  I don't know.  He understands the show.  He gets it.  Unlike two cities that will be dropping us soon.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  It's going to work in Chicago, Philly, Washington, Boston, and New York, but it's not going  to work in your cute little city.  Okay.  Yeah.  You know what you're doing, obviously.  Jackass.  Uh, Psycho Tim, what's going on?  Gentlemen, what's up, dude?  Hey.  Hey.  Oh, Psycho Tim calling from Boston, Anthony. 
[00:38:30]  Is he?  It's opening day.  Opening day.  How bad was the, uh, the Yankees sucks chant today?  I haven't heard it yet, but I'm sure it's going to happen, because we suck.  By saying that.  Are you okay?  Well, I'm drunk again, obviously, but that's just normal.  But I want to thank the Boston Hell, because they, uh, wrote the CS line about how the Boston  police were taking kickbacks from the scalpers.  So they arrest all the scalpers, so you can't get tickets today to the game. 
[00:39:00]  There's no ticket to Boston.  The first game is five years.  But the Boston Hell sucks.  Yeah, Pedro got pounded today in Boston, huh?  That's right.  Because they came in.  They shoot the ball of the scalpers this morning, and there's no tickets, dude.  He has no idea what happened in the game.  Oh, man.  There's no tickets.  There's a million, all a bunch of facts that there's nowhere to get in the game.  There's probably, like, 5,000 tickets at a police station someplace right now.  They effed a lot of, uh, hardcore Red Sox fans.  I saw the expose in the Boston papers. 
[00:39:30]  They had, hold on, hold on, they had aerial views outside, uh, Fenway, and they were pointing  out all the scalpers.  Really?  And then not only were they pointing out the scalpers, Anthony, they're pointing out where  the police were.  So they're showing, like, a policeman literally 10 feet from a scalper.  So some of the cops would, like, get kickbacks from the scalper?  That, plus they had no clue that the guy they were standing 10 feet from was a scalper.  Wow.  So it pissed off the, you know, the police up there in the city.  So they went in a Fenway today and got rid of all scalpers. 
[00:40:00]  Wow.  And people like Psycho Tim and other people that don't have tickets, you know, they go opening  day and do what they can outside the stadium to get in.  Even my normal scalper, the guy that always scalped tickets up, he was like, oh, dude, I got  nothing.  You know, you get in a relationship with your scalper, obviously.  Yeah.  It's like your bookie.  Yeah.  And, no, you can't even sell.  They used to let you sell them for coke, like, for the ticket price.  Right.  And not pinch it for it.  Yeah, that's right.  And now it's because of the Herald, a bunch of liberals, and the Herald screwed it all  up.  It's the last moment of communism, the Boston Herald. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, that's a big story up there, so.  All right.  Well, that's when I call in.  I'll call you guys if we get arrested later, though.  All right.  Thank you.  Yeah, I'm sure that'll happen.  All right.  Bye.  Psycho Tam.  Is Boston dropping the opening, Anthony Show, Anthony?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Boston?  You guys are going to be real surprised when you realize this is not an April Fool's prank.  Mmm.  Alice, what's going on?  What's up?  I got, like, another one of those April Fool's pranks.  Yeah.  Yeah, I heard it on that joke of a station, Z100. 
[00:41:00]  Z100!  Yeah.  It was, like, a year or two ago.  They had one of the DJs disguising his voice, like, being some internet guy.  Yeah.  And they were telling people that they were going to start charging for emails because  the post office wasn't making enough money.  Oh, really?  So emails were going to cost money?  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  Wow.  That's pretty, pretty waxing.  Alice, did you fall for it?  No.  Not even a little bit?  No. 
[00:41:30]  They didn't get you?  Nope.  I really don't care because I don't pay.  My parents do.  All right, Alice.  Thank you.  All right.  You guys talk.  Andy down here, it looks like he played a little April Fool's gag that seems kind of  funny and good-natured.  Oh, look at Andy.  This is a...  Andy!  This is a cute one.  Yeah.  Did you get involved with April Fool's Day?  Yeah, me and my buddy did.  We, uh...  What'd you do?  Well, we were outdoor hanging for Donato's, a pizza place in Circleville here in Ohio.  Yeah.  And after hearing Norton's little plan for an idea with the, you know, the dead baby joke 
[00:42:00]  there...  Yeah.  Well, the girl was hanging up a poster for a lost cat.  Yeah.  And so, uh, we stopped there and asked her what kind of a cat it would look like, you  know?  She's like, it was a calico.  So, we went down to, uh, or we told her that there was a dead, or a cat down at the  store.  Oh, my God.  So, she's like, you know, getting all excited.  Yeah.  And we, like, pulled away and yelled April Fool's and she's just crying with her eyes out.  Oh.  Oh, dude.  That's kind of brutal.  Yeah, it's funny, though. 
[00:42:30]  She wasn't really a little, like, too little of a girl.  I don't know if it was worse, though.  The joke that he pulled, or the story.  Trying to tell it.  Uh-uh, hey.  I can't tell a story.  Look how it's summed up here.  It says, called a lost cat poster, got the girl's hopes all up.  Yeah.  That's good.  That's all you need to say.  Then he went on, Andy.  Well, thank you.  Thanks, Andy.  Yep, thank you.  All right.  I feel bad for the girl now.  Kind of like Norton's dates.  They all can't be gems.  Right.  John, what's up?  Hey, man. 
[00:43:00]  How's it going?  What's up?  You're next.  All right.  Hey.  Go ahead.  Hey.  Guys, how's it going?  Jesus Christ.  Why aren't you talking?  I'm talking.  All right.  Go ahead.  Talk.  All right.  I was driving back from Houston this morning, and one of the DJs down there pulled a prank.  He said they weren't going to be accepting the old $20 anymore.  Oh, the old bills?  He was telling everybody they had to go to the bank by 6 p.m. Eastern time today to change  them out for the new ones.  Right.  And he had just about everybody there, man. 
[00:43:30]  The big head bills?  The guy got suspended.  Yeah.  Take out the old ones and put in the new down syndrome bills.  Yeah, because they took them off and they had so many, like over 10,000 people calling  and complaining about it.  Oh, so they suspended them?  Well, they suspended him without pay, you know, until it was bad.  Oh, stop it.  All right, John.  John, John, John.  You're talking to two guys that have been doing radio a really long time now, okay?  Okay.  All right, so the prank goes, the new dollar bill, $20 bills with the big head, right, 
[00:44:00]  are the ones that are acceptable.  If you have the old version with the small head, you've got to turn it in.  Turn it in.  Turn it in today before 6, right?  Yeah.  Or you're going to lose that money, obviously.  Or you couldn't use them anymore.  So then what happened to the DJ for saying this?  Well, they took him off the air and they're going to let everybody know tomorrow morning  what's going on with him.  Okay.  Nothing is going on with the DJ.  Yeah.  He's going to be just fine.  And who said that there was 10,000 complaint calls that came in?  It's Cox Communications. 
[00:44:30]  I'm not sure if you were with him.  Cox?  Yeah, Cox Communications.  If Ant and I could kill someone right now in studio, we wouldn't get 10,000 people to  call management.  Okay?  Yeah, well, the representative from Cox is the one that, you know, came on the air and  said he was sorry for the prank that he had to do.  Yeah, Cox.  It really is a radio group.  I know that.  So what?  Oh, the guy comes in and says, I'm the general manager of Arrow 107 and the prank you heard  this morning, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  We are going to decide the fate of this prankster. 
[00:45:00]  At 520.  Yeah, pretty much.  So tune in tomorrow at 520 to see if he's fired or keeps his job.  Thank you.  Now back to your regular programming.  Right?  Yeah, not word for word, but pretty much.  Yeah.  The guy's fine.  Fake.  Fake, stupid radio.  Was it Rocco?  Was that the guy's name?  Rocco?  I don't know.  No?  All right.  I don't remember his name.  Thank you.  Hey, Rocco's here.  Scott Pharrell, sorry to make you wait, but we're running.  Dude, man, I have no problem waiting for you guys. 
[00:45:30]  You're gods, but I'm drunk and I need to focus on my priorities on getting back.  We're not god-like in two cities.  Where?  What's the problem?  Two cities dropping the show.  Where?  I mean, you know, I have a lot of that experience in getting leveraged out.  You name the city.  I've been done by them.  I was in 100 markets.  Next thing you know, I was in 50.  I made all kinds of friends.  How about Brett Favre eating vomit Vicodin?  That one went over real well in Green Bay and Milwaukee.  And Larry Bird in Indianapolis? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  It doesn't matter where.  Name the city.  Chicago.  They're all pussies.  Chicago actually helped us out today.  You'll be on CKG any day.  We're on CKG.  You gotta love that.  See?  Look, it happened.  I'm all cool with that.  That's power.  That's leverage.  This is your New York, Philly, D.C., Chicago.  Dude, enough of that.  Lipstick City.  You are snotted.  You have fun down there at Hooters, man?  I'm just completely.  I mean, I went down there and had, you know, I showed up at noon, had a bunch of beers.  I sucked down.  That's fun. 
[00:46:30]  Friday night I went to, you know, the Devils game and I sat out in a parking lot and sucked  down a hundred bass beers.  Saturday I went to the Colorado cafe and watched chicks just bikini bull ride ass.  Just leverage.  Just rack.  Where do you see that?  Just, you know, leverage, rack.  And Keith was there.  He saw it.  Mostly we saw drunk dudes up on the bull and it made me, like, dethroned.  We tried to get Lady Di on the bull.  We gotta have them.  Yeah, I was thinking the gears would have flown out and springs would have flown out. 
[00:47:00]  Then I did Hooters today for the opener.  Mo Vaughn struck out.  I got a limp.  I hate Mo Vaughn.  What was the final?  I don't even know.  They're still playing.  They're still playing?  So Boston, they started the season.  Hold on, hold on.  It's 4-1 Mets right now.  4-1 Mets.  You're a Pirates fan, I see.  Yeah, I have 1960.  And I'm a Hoosier fan.  I went to IU.  So the Hoosiers are gonna win the national championship tonight.  They've never lost in the championship game.  Everybody keeps dissing them.  Now they're gonna do Maryland for the coup de grace.  Not a chance. 
[00:47:30]  Not a chance.  Yeah, you know what Juan Dixon's gonna get tonight?  A little bit of Mr. Fife's whiteness.  You gotta get some of that whiteness on your ass.  Get some of that whiteness on your black ass playing basketball.  Nothing like a guy like Steve Alford or Mr. Fife to shut you down when you're a badass.  Do you hear the guy saying, no one can stop me.  No one can slow me down.  I'm gonna fill it up on your ass.  That white guy irritates everybody. 
[00:48:00]  And everybody hates having the Hill Jack Hoosiers in the national championship game.  They've never lost a game ever.  They're gonna be 6-0 when it's all said and done.  And when it's over, I'm gonna raise a drink up to Bob Knight.  Because he recruited all of the white boys that are playing with the Bushies.  He recruited that whole team.  Mike Davis did nothing to recruit this team.  He just coached him.  He's done a great job, but that's Bob Knight's team.  He walked into a cushy situation.  It's Bob Knight's team.  That's all there is to it.  Bob Knight's a legend. 
[00:48:30]  He's the guy that coaches him.  He's the guy that recruited him.  He's the guy that knew Newton was the kid in Atlanta that would block shots and say  bitch every time he swatted one the other night.  Who's laughing now as I keep covering spreads?  Right.  The Hoosiers.  Who's laughing now?  He speaks the truth though.  I guess so.  It's Bob Knight's team.  So Friday I'm doing the Yankees.  And we're going to stands.  And that's gonna be ugly.  Elbows.  You've been to this place.  Stands?  It's a hole.  I love this place.  The Bronx and River out are gonna be elbows up. 
[00:49:00]  They're gonna be fans drinking and yelling and screaming and spitting and talking and  yelling.  Yankee fans are irate.  They're observant.  They're vicious.  They're foul-mouthed.  I hate Yankee fans.  Have you ever seen me here at 4 in the afternoon and 4 in the morning?  No.  You were hanging with Lady Di?  I hear she snotted outside the studio.  She's digging.  Totally like hammered.  She's digging me man.  She's got a crush on you.  No.  No she doesn't.  She has a crush on Ann.  But now I'm thinking.  Now I'm hearing that she has a crush on you.  Dude he's got a hottie man. 
[00:49:30]  I can't even stay here man.  She did that new thing with her two.  I'm out of here.  That little fluff she's got going.  And she's in the house.  I'm blustered.  Honestly God.  I was out there and I was like God bless Anthony.  Did you see my cousins here?  Careful.  Now Ben come on.  I'm getting angles here.  Hold on.  Get a lady dying here.  Where did you go on vacation?  Nowhere really.  I went skiing and then.  Where did you go skiing?  Killington.  How was it?  It was good.  Pico? 
[00:50:00]  No Killington I said.  Yes she is.  What's it like?  Dude you're snotted.  You're not even focusing.  You're snotted?  Over here.  There's a paper rolled up in the back.  What do you want me to say?  Neon Miami Vice colors on her.  Hello.  Lady Di.  How are you doing?  80's jacket.  Lady Di, happy birthday.  I love it.  Thank you so much.  Happy 40th darling.  Glad you could come down and spooge off of me.  You're celebrating your 40th birthday at Hooters today?  Yes I did.  Yeah it was a wing and rack type day with a mess.  Mo Vaughn's striking out. 
[00:50:30]  I'm sure she had a great time.  Now I heard you had a few pitchers of beer.  No I did not have a few pitchers of beer.  I had a couple.  Listen to what I'm talking about.  Who are you kidding?  You're bomb.  She's trying so hard.  You're wasted.  She's trying so hard to hold it together.  You're wasted.  You're already wasted.  I tried to get you a Sam Adams.  She said you wanted to do me.  It's ridiculous.  I do not have three pitchers of beer.  Keith you heard her head behind me.  Well you are book looking.  It's never ending.  Did you see me hit on the Mater D down there?  I have a boyfriend.  She said. 
[00:51:00]  I have a boyfriend.  Hold on.  Everyone's talking at the same time.  It sucks.  Real quick.  The appearance we did the other night over at the place in Jersey.  Pharrell's throwing out t-shirts.  Colorado Cafe.  He runs out of t-shirts.  He starts winging those beer openers.  Screaming the girl's name who got hit in the head with a hockey puck.  And he's winging them out in the garage.  They're bouncing off the windows.  Yeah.  No.  I had some little opener fly problems with the fans.  I was whipping them into the fans and they were jettisoning off into people's eyeballs.  Into the ceiling.  And I blamed Brittany the dead girl in Columbus. 
[00:51:30]  Sorry Columbus.  Pump girl.  Too bad you're the rectum of America anyway.  I can't believe they ever gave a hockey team to that miserable backward ass state.  Oh my God.  Go ahead Cleveland you sissy fags.  You have nothing.  Wow.  You know something?  You have nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  If it wasn't for O and A you guys would all be backward ass fags.  So what's up with Lady Di?  She's claiming she's not hammered?  I am not hammered.  She is hammered.  She's been drinking with me for four hours.  I am not hammered.  I've had fifteen beers.  Who's kidding who? 
[00:52:00]  I love the fact that you guys brought me in here.  I said I've had fifteen beers.  They're like bring him on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Lady Di.  I've been here at four in the morning and four in the afternoon.  Yes.  Hold on.  Lady Di.  I share saliva with you.  You've been exercising you said and dieting?  Uh yes.  So why does it look like you have four boobs now in front?  Oh my God.  I didn't do it today.  I didn't do it on Easter Sunday.  I didn't do it on Easter Sunday.  I didn't do it on Sunday.  She's a ranger fan.  That's a problem.  The rangers with all their Messiers and all the wonderfulness. 
[00:52:30]  The rangers still have a little bit of a chance this year.  Ron Lowe's fired.  They should bring Messier as the coach.  They're done.  They're five points out of it.  Drunken talking.  They're the enema of the Michel.  They're sissies.  No they're not.  They can't beat anybody.  Theo Fleury is great.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Yeah.  And you have a chance to get laid.  Look at her.  Lady Di looks like she's got laid.  Lady Di looks like she has an inner tube on and she's ready to jump in a pool.  Yeah.  What do you got? 
[00:53:00]  Swimmies?  You wearing Swimmies?  Where's all the Red Sox fans?  Where are they?  They're still at the game.  You got any?  He's right here.  Pedro is getting yanked.  How many did he give out today?  Hold on.  Hold on.  There's a couple people that wanted to talk to her.  He got just absolutely butt ass.  Shut the F up.  Okay.  You stink.  Tom, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Tom, go ahead.  How you doing?  Alright.  Hey, dude.  I turned your mic off.  What's up, brother?  Hey, Pharrell.  Hey, what's up, brother?  Did you share saliva with Bob Knight or what? 
[00:53:30]  No, I've been sharing.  It would die.  How about this?  Pharrell, listen.  When my time is up here and my activities have passed, I want that they bury me upside down  so Pharrell can kiss my ass.  Let's face facts.  Bob Knight.  Check out his new book, Night Time.  It's a great book.  Stories about Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio, guys like Claire B.  There's a lot of New York and Boston in it.  He's a legend.  Let's face facts.  Bob Knight is the greatest coach I've ever been around in my life.  It's too bad he's an a-hole to people, but whatever. 
[00:54:00]  I love him.  I agree that he's legendary.  But hey, he had a lot to do with recruiting a lot of these guys that are playing.  Every one of them went there because of Bob Knight.  Bob Knight, and I think everyone that goes to Texas Tech is because of Bob Knight.  He's the best friend he could ever have if he's your friend.  Much like Landon Turner, they've got to just do you.  That's all there is to it.  All right, this guy from Cleveland, very pissed.  A little pissed off, Cleveland?  You were making fun of Columbus.  Marcelo Cologne looked great from Cleveland yesterday at 5-inch shuttle.  Kevin, what's up?  Tell that dude to shut his freaking mouth before I come down there and smack him.  Okay, Ohio. 
[00:54:30]  Go ahead there, Blaine.  You're a piece of crap.  Why don't you, like, clear your voice before you talk.  Shut up, you castor oil drinking scotch sissy.  I got something for you, Ohio.  Go to your Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and play with yourself.  Go ahead.  You sound like a girl.  You get 30 days of bad weather a month.  Shut up.  A little penis.  Go root for the Browns, you couch sissy.  Wow.  Go ahead.  You have nothing.  Hey, what do you do?  Go root for the Cavaliers?  They draw two people, you fam. 
[00:55:00]  Well, basketball's for faggots anyway.  At least the Knicks suck and they draw, you sissy.  Go ahead.  Hey, where else can you get a 13-year-old girl to get killed by a hockey puck?  Oh.  Give me a break.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  You said it, not me.  That's horrible.  Uh, Bill, what's going on?  Hey, I'm a Ranger fan.  I've been a long-time Ranger fan.  But if Lady dies a Ranger fan, too, I've got one thing to say.  Yeah.  Let's go, Islanders.  Hallelujah.  Oh.  Gonna kick the Devils out tonight. 
[00:55:30]  The Islanders and Devils are gonna do great in the playoffs.  I think the Devils...  Hey, look, they can take the Devils out, I can root for them.  The Devils can beat anybody with their defensive style.  Now that they have Constantine and Larry behind the bench, I think the Langenbrunner,  New and Dyke additions are a great along the walls.  They're finishing checks.  The difference is, is the Islanders have beaten the Flyers three times in Philly.  Screw them.  I gotta tell you something about the Islanders, local paper on Long Island.  You and I are going to the playoffs together.  Hold on, hold on.  It has a huge ad on Newsday, Anthony.  It says, I swear they had to say this, too.  It says, this is not a joke. 
[00:56:00]  Islander playoff tickets go on sale.  Whatever, Monday.  This is not a joke.  But they had to say in the paper, this is not a joke.  They say, we're back, are you, everything else.  You know, the night I went out there to see the Islander game, it was great.  We had great seats, front row, floor one, they keep winning.  They've been the most consistent team here in New York.  The Rangers have fallen off the face of the earth since the All-Star game.  They haven't won jack.  They've fallen off the face of the earth, they're done.  You know what I like about the Devils?  That they can play in a Stanley Cup, win, and the fact that nobody's in the stands doesn't 
[00:56:30]  even seem to affect them.  Yeah, I was there the other night.  I did a bash.  They still play with energy.  The fact that nobody cares about the Devils.  We had a tailgate party, Keith.  There was like a couple hundred people there raging, drinking beer.  Yeah, we had a good time.  Definitely a lot of drinking, a lot of party.  How the hell do you have a team?  And they lost three to one.  How do you have a team, though, that wins the Stanley Cup, and no one cares, no one goes.  We went to the Islander Devils.  No one cares.  We went to the Islander Devils game in Jersey, me and Joey, about a week and a half ago.  Yeah.  And it was half empty.  Yeah.  I don't believe it.  No one cares about that team.  It was packed the other night. 
[00:57:00]  Hold on, another guy wants to take you to task on Cleveland.  Go ahead.  Andrew, what's up?  I grew up in Pittsburgh.  Why would I like Cleveland?  What's up with Pharrell here talking about Cleveland?  He's never even been here.  Hey, yes, I have, sissy.  I've been to Canton.  I've been to Akron.  I've been to Stowe.  I've done your sister.  Brandon Akron's a bunch of pussies down there.  I've done everybody in Cleveland so many times over.  I've been to the Hall of Fame, and I've watched the Steelers dick you like Brian Sipe  for years with mud in your face.  Jack Lambert.  The Steelers have a Hall of Fame wing.  The Browns have dirty enema underpants. 
[00:57:30]  The Browns have nothing.  Their bosses cheat.  Carmen Policy's a liar.  So is Dwight Clark.  They're on the take.  They're extortionists.  Oh, I got some mouth for you.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Go for a shot.  That's harsh.  Will you shut up, Lady Di?  I'm just telling it like it is.  Blah, blah, blah.  I'm from Pittsburgh.  Why would I like Cleveland ever?  Katrina.  Yes.  Pittsburgh's been our lover, you know, Cleveland. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, Pittsburgh is such a glamorous city.  Oh, yeah.  Dude, that is the only guy I've ever heard that sounds like Gargamel from the Smurfs.  Oh, whatever.  Go to an animation movie, bitch.  Dude, you need to stop smoking because you're going to like...  Whatever.  I sound like this all the time.  You should hear me when I'm hungover.  All right, let's go to Rick from Columbus.  Rick.  Yeah, Pharrell.  Hey, I've been to Columbus before.  The only thing I ever liked about Columbus was going to a football game there and barfing  all over your community. 
[00:58:30]  Whoa, the Buckeyes.  You don't mess with them.  Yeah, don't mess with them.  They don't win dick.  Oh.  Whatever you won.  Whatever you won.  Whatever you won.  Nice job in the Big Ten tournament as Indiana did.  You're right.  Whoa, Big Ten tournament.  I think Ohio State won the Big Ten tournament.  But Ohio State, they have nothing since Havlicek.  Sixty-five, count it.  Sixty-eight national football champions.  Oh, my God.  You're talking about the 60s.  You know, my mother was alive.  Like, I care about it.  We listen to you.  The only thing good about Cleveland is Andre Miller. 
[00:59:00]  Andre Miller is the only thing good about Cleveland.  He's the best player in town.  Mike, you're next.  I was wondering if Harvey Fierstein is going to shut the house.  Oh, yeah, Harvey, I've got to tell you something.  It's really funny.  Oh, good one, dude.  I'm so thrilled.  I'm so enamored by Cleveland.  I'll tell you, you know what I did?  I did Ohio twice.  I'm bored with it.  I don't even want to be on the air there.  I don't want to be syndicated in Ohio.  Thanks.  All right, Scott.  Cleveland calling like crazy now. 
[00:59:30]  I love New York.  Mother forellers.  Scott, what's going on?  Not much, man.  I was calling to see how you guys are doing.  I want to talk to the guy who's got a frog in his voice.  Yeah, that's right.  I got a frog and I got his lover, too.  Yeah, somebody, the guy from the little rascal's froggy.  Hey, I'm from Cleveland, man.  Cleveland rocks, man.  I don't know what the hell you're doing for.  Get a job, Romeo.  Oh, right.  Cleveland is rocked this year.  The only thing good about Cleveland is the Blossom Music Center.  Who are you kidding?  Your girlfriend's ugly.  You don't?  Shut up.  The only thing good about Cleveland is the Blossom Music Center and my knee surgeon lives 
[01:00:00]  there and I don't have a bad knee.  Bad knee.  I just know he's on the take.  Lady Di wants to do you.  Hey, now.  Absolutely.  Oh, God.  I love Scott.  I think he's great.  I love coming up here 15, she's shy, shag-a-doo.  Hey, Lady Di, someone told us that you like Pharrell, like Pharrell and his show a little better  than the Opie and Anthony show.  That's ridiculous.  That's sacrilege.  No, I want to say that's completely fine and well improved. 
[01:00:30]  Pharrell, you can have her.  Just hang out with Pharrell and don't come around anymore.  And we don't want anything in return, man.  Yeah.  This is a trade in our favor.  You get Lady Di, we get nothing.  We get nothing.  And we're okay with that.  I get Mo Bond, don't I?  In the mo-licious.  You gotta give me something as a pirate fan.  You can have all our listeners that love Mo Bond.  I listen to both of you guys all the time.  I'll get a life.  Shut up.  Look at Rick eating McDonald's, man.  He's desperate.  All right, hold on.  All the boys in here.  Roger from Boston wants in.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, nice job by Pedro today.  Hey, what do you guys think?  I think the Bruins are gonna be going pretty far this year. 
[01:01:00]  Hey, hey.  Nice slap shot.  A wicked hot slap side by Jackie Parker.  Huh?  Nice job Pedro.  He's as skinny as I am.  He's got a better chance than the island.  He can't toe the line.  Boston, the best thing they got going for him is Joe Thornton, Samsonoff, and all the  guys.  Axel Ross.  I love what they're doing.  There's no doubt that they've done a great job.  Too bad Robbie Vittorek is a dick.  Yeah, hey.  I tell you what.  Everybody here hates him.  Like a Boston team though, just like the Pats. 
[01:01:30]  They're doing it as a team and they're gonna go all the way just like the Pats did.  Oh boy.  I think the Bruins are tough with Defoe.  There's nothing stopping them.  I'm not gonna deny that they're having a great season.  Joe Thornton's been unbelievable.  Their defense, Hal Gill.  I like watching them.  Too bad they play in that Enema Center.  All right, Paul.  What's up?  Pharrell, you're the man, baby.  What's up, brother?  How can I be the man when you're the man?  I love going to Fenway and sucking down beers.  Who needs to hate each other as much as we do?  I love the fact that the Sox fans are now saying things like, hey, the Pats did it. 
[01:02:00]  Like, that's gonna be their whole war cry of the season.  They're still looking for Bampino's piano.  Bruno, tell me tonight.  Bruno, take Indiana plus the eight tonight.  You can bank it.  Dude, I had Indiana in the six against the Sooners and all I have to say is lick my package.  They did them.  That's all there is to it.  They're unstoppable.  They've never lost in a national championship game.  When I was there, they won it all in 87 against Derek Coleman.  He missed the front end of the one and one.  Keith Smart from Thomas.  Bass.  Who cares if the movie sucks? 
[01:02:30]  Go Hoosiers.  All right.  Let's go to Philly real fast.  Ken, go ahead.  What's up, YSP?  You guys rule.  There's Washington.  Bring them all on.  Philly's going to take them all.  Too bad all your players went down injured.  Roenick crippled over like an old lady.  And your boy Primo's got sore ribs.  His girlfriend doesn't even do him.  He's so soft.  You guys had first place all year.  The Bruins passed you.  You guys are pussies.  Shut up.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  You know it's true.  The Flyers had it all. 
[01:03:00]  They had it all wrapped up.  And then they coiffed as usual.  Because Bobby Clark's a pussy just like his team.  Tony.  All right, Scott.  Tony, I'll go back to Pittsburgh and be your homosexual quarterback's life partner.  Oh, you're so funny.  What do you want to do?  Lick Cordell's bumps on his neck, bitch?  Oh, Jesus.  Your awful quarterback.  Shut up.  Shut up.  It went further than the Eagles with all your sissy stuff.  They couldn't get to their 1-15 with us.  Go ahead with your Jeremiah Trotter in your pants.  Oh, boo.  Go ahead with Iverson, you idiot. 
[01:03:30]  All right.  Yeah, you come to Cleveland.  We'll put a little tear down.  I thought you were talking about Philly, you sissy bitch.  Couldn't handle it.  I don't want to go back to football, boo.  Shut up.  You guys have nothing in Cleveland, man.  Go to school.  Do something to get a job.  All right.  Whatever.  Whatever.  I'm bored, man.  Give me some...  What do you got, some West Coast action?  Can we argue with some of them?  We're not on in the West Coast towns yet.  No, not yet.  They're evil.  Working on it.  I miss that girl from D.C. with the big rack, Stephanie. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, Stephanie.  I got her on my fridge, man.  I say hi to her every morning.  Stephanie rocks.  She says, thanks for everything, Pharrell, and I'm like, thank you.  She's giving out wow stickers all over D.C. for us.  I love that chick.  Did you see her sight?  No.  No.  It was too much money.  You got to give some leverage to get on it, though.  She's got it going on.  Really?  You guys are bad asses, man.  Eat a photo.com.  Something viv, sex, love, lick, something.  Get something.  Boys, good to see you.  Peace, Pharrell.  Thanks, Pharrell.  Later, man.  And Lady Di, ugh. 
[01:04:30]  We might get back to you.  See you later.  Go have another beer for your 40th friend.  Have another beer.  I'll have another beer.  And go suck on Scott's mule for a while.  I'll have another beer.  I'll have another beer.  I'll have another beer.  She's all touchy.  Ugh.  Rub it on me.  I guess Lady Di tried to kiss Rick on the lips today.  No, I didn't.  I saw you.  Oh, God.  You saw Jim?  Yeah.  She puckered up her awful thin lips and tried to kiss Rick.  And she was coming at me and I put my hand up and blocked it.  I did not.  I went to where she was. 
[01:05:00]  Hey.  Don't touch.  Don't touch.  Don't touch.  Don't touch.  She has a mouth like that woman in the body of Dolph Sweet.  Dolph Sweet.  Uh, Keith, what's going on?  Yeah, I was listening to AAF.  They got an April Fool's joke going right now.  Oh, yeah?  What's that?  They got Rocco on the air pretending that people are actually listening to his show.  Oh.  April Fool's.  That'll leave a bruise.  All right, bro.  Thanks.  Take it easy.  Sir?  We better take a little break here.  Yeah. 
[01:05:30]  Don't forget, Jay Moore calling in at...  Now it's 4.30.  They keep changing...  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  What?  They keep changing time, but yeah, 4.30.  All right, hopefully when we get back we'll talk to Jay Moore.  Yeah.  He's got a great idea.  He wants Ant and I to film a little something to open up one of his Moore Sports shows.  Can't wait.  I guess it debuts tomorrow night on ESPN.  Yes.  The promos look hilarious.  Moore Sports.  Looks like it's going to be okay.  And Moore is spelt like his last name.  Right.  We'll talk to Jay Moore, hopefully next, and he will tell Anthony his great idea. 
[01:06:00]  Right.  You're going to lose it, my friend.  I can't wait.  Anthony.  He's a son of a bitch.  Anthony.  That guy's a rapist.  Opie and Anthony.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Jeez.  Okay.  Terrific.  Okay.  Terrific.  Couple phone numbers.  In the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Boston today.  It was four years ago today that we effed up real bad. 
[01:06:30]  Well, it worked out for the best, but yeah, at the time, really bad.  And then WAF and Dave Nicklaus turned their backs on us, thinking at the time it was a good move.  Boy, were they mistaken.  Dave Nicklaus is learning fully, but surely that Opie and Anthony always win in the end.  Always.  Always.  So if you're in Boston or anywhere else outside of New York, 866-277-4WOW.  People think we're pulling a little April Fool's prank today, Anthony. 
[01:07:00]  I know.  We're not.  There's nothing we can say to convince you that we're not pulling a prank, but this is the info we got just before showtime.  Two of the cities that broadcast the Opie and Anthony show in syndication will be dropping the show in the very near future.  So a week from now when it's a reality, maybe as soon as tomorrow, you're going to be like, oh my God, those guys weren't kidding.  What happened?  I thought it was an April Fool's.  But where?  What happened?  Where are they?  All right.  That is the facts, my friend. 
[01:07:30]  You know what's really important?  Ann has a hot cousin.  She is really sexy.  I saw you drooling.  Back off.  My cousin Alicia.  She's very sweet.  Very cute girl.  Very pretty.  I already got the hots for aunt's mom, so I ain't going with the cousin too.  Ah.  Norton's looking around, you know, like we were just outside during the commercial break.  Ah, don't do that.  And then Norton just starts looking like, and then I walk out and he looks over at me and  he makes that, huh?  Huh? 
[01:08:00]  Huh?  Huh?  Face.  And I'm like, don't look at me like that.  You look at me like that every time there's a girl in here and it's fine, but you know.  Well, it's family.  That was very nice.  It was very nice.  And she's here to visit the program and I'm obligated to look out for her safety, which  means keeping you at least a hundred feet away at all times.  So, Jim, let's make sure she doesn't leave with the hiv today, okay?  No, she won't.  I was very nice.  Dan's cousin.  She's very courteous and she's married, so it was really polite.  All right.  We're waiting for Jay Moore to call with his great idea. 
[01:08:30]  Jay Moore.  He was on the line and I don't know.  Ugh.  What happened?  I know you got all pissed off right before we went live here.  Stupid agent people.  I'm like, I need to talk to Jay real fast before he goes on the air with us.  Yeah.  And the guy couldn't figure it out.  Next thing you know, the phone hangs up.  And we need him right this minute.  Silly goose.  Another little side thing that's going on today.  It's opening day.  Everyone knows that.  Baseball is here.  So we broke out some of our favorite baseball bits.  Right.  That we've played for you guys over the years. 
[01:09:00]  Some great stuff.  We got the classic Bob Murphy call.  Bob Murphy.  We have Rick's Latin baseball we'll be playing today.  Boys of the New York Bits.  Why?  That's the best Bob Murphy I've ever heard in my life.  High fly ball.  Deep center field.  Easily caught.  Oh, the game didn't start yet.  Well, he's a little senile. 
[01:09:30]  Our Met announcer here in New York is a little senile.  He's been doing it forever.  That one high and long.  It was my lung I just coughed up.  Easily caught.  How old is he now?  He's...  You guys got to be in his goddamn hundred and twelves.  He was celebrating 20 years of broadcasting when like Rusty Staub was playing.  20 years of broadcasting.  That was back then.  So, I mean, do the math.  I don't know.  My nose is a little stuffy today.  I like the blow. 
[01:10:00]  A little bit of toot.  We might as well play the Bob Murphy.  I love this one.  This is Bob Murphy pretty much effing up a call, Anthony.  Yeah.  The pitch.  High fly ball.  It's deep to left center field.  It's way back.  It may be playable.  Agbayani can't get a play.  It's gone.  A home run.  Oh, he caught it.  He caught it at the wall.  I was not sure he was unable to reach it.  It was caught by Agbayani.  I apologize.  He was way out there and it didn't look like he had a play on it. 
[01:10:30]  But he caught it against the wall in left center field.  You know, hearing that clip again?  Yeah.  I got to say, he never saw the ball.  No.  He was just going through the motions.  He saw, you know, the fielder, you know, going back through the wall and just assumed,  you know, he's seen that play a million times that the guy was catching it.  High fly ball.  Going deep.  It's gone.  It's out of the ball.  What?  I'm playing golf with somebody?  I didn't know where I was.  He caught it?  Where's he from with that? 
[01:11:00]  He has the, as he's unlistenable.  High fly ball.  Deep to center field.  High fly.  Now we pause for these words from Budweiser.  All right.  Now I'm getting worried that Jay's calling back in 15 minutes.  He's a very busy man.  Well, he's taping stuff for more sports.  With the score of 5-9, we pause.  We pause. 
[01:11:30]  Let's go to Chris.  Chris, what's going on?  ONA.  Hey, Chris.  What's up, guys?  You tell me.  Hey, Tom, you're a drunken fool from New Orleans.  Yeah.  Do you think he could have blown it for the city down here?  I mean, is this a possibility that we could be losing you guys?  Well, you may say that we might be off the aisle.  He's, uh, your bar down here had a couple too many bears and his little practical joke  is that, uh, we might be losing y'all. 
[01:12:00]  Might be New Orleans, you think?  Yeah.  What do you think, is it?  Come on.  Well, we better move on to the next caller now.  Move on.  Thank you, Chris.  Move, move.  Okay.  Ah, Eric.  You're on.  Hey, guys.  With Opie and Anthony.  Norton rules.  Thank you, fella.  You're welcome.  Hey, Bob Murphy made a phone call today that was a towering line drive.  A towering line drive in the center field.  That one at least six feet high. 
[01:12:30]  You know, I'm a huge Mets fan.  Later, guys.  Everyone knows that.  After what you did with Bob Murphy's voice last year.  Bob Murphy.  I have to listen to the radio broadcast now.  Yeah, I know.  It is a lot of fun.  It makes it so much fun.  When he's really having a bad day, when he's got the gurgling phlegm going,  it's just, you have to listen.  It's painful, but you have to listen.  He just had a good one.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on, Jim.  What a day for Al Leiter.  What a day for Al Leiter. 
[01:13:00]  Go ahead, Jim.  Mets win.  But Murphy had a call.  It was right before the game.  Last pitch, as a matter of fact.  There was a pop-up down the third baseline.  Alfonso going under.  He bacheled the ball.  I think he lost it in the lights.  I mean the daylight.  Did he really say that?  I swear to God.  He lost it in the lights.  I mean the daylight.  He lost it in the lights.  I mean the daylight.  I mean the daylight. 
[01:13:30]  Boys, have a good day.  They better not get rid of Bob Murphy any time soon.  Too much fun.  That's great.  That's great.  We got our Earl Weaver we can play here.  Ah.  This is another classic.  Greatest clip ever.  Yep.  Earl Weaver's phenomenal.  I like this one.  Earl Weaver, the old Orioles manager there.  He used to have a Coach's Corner show and he lost it one day.  This really is one of the best things ever.  It's great.  Check it out.  The manager's corner with the thoughts and opinions of the American League's winningest 
[01:14:00]  manager, the Orioles, Earl Weaver.  And now, to the manager's corner with Earl Weaver.  Well, Bill Whitehouse, Earl, that certainly is an answer from Frederick Merriman wants to  know why you and the Orioles don't go out and get some more team speed.  Team speed, for Christ's sake.  You get some goddamn little fleas on a f***ing basis, getting picked off, trying to steal,  getting thrown out, taking runs away from you.  You get them big f***ers that can hit the f***ing ball out of the ballpark and you can't 
[01:14:30]  make any goddamn mistakes.  Well, certainly this show is going to get out in history, Earl.  Terry Elliott of Washington, D.C., wants to know why you don't use Terry Crowley as a  designated hitter all the time.  Well, Terry Crowley's lucky he's in f***ing baseball, for Christ's sake.  He was released by the Cincinnati Reds.  He was released by the f***ing goddamn Atlanta Braves.  We saw that Terry Crowley could sit on his f***ing ass for eight innings and enjoy watching  a baseball game, just like any other fan, and has the ability to get up there and break 
[01:15:00]  one open in the f***ing night.  So if this f***er had mined his own business and let me manage the f***ing team, we'd be a lot better  off.  Well, certainly you've made your opinions known on the fans' questions about baseball, Earl,  but let's get to something else.  Alice Sweet from Norfolk wants to know the best time to put in a tomato plant.  Alice Sweet ought to be worried about where the f*** her next lane is coming from rather  than where her next goddamn tomato plant is coming from.  If she'd get her ass out to f***ing bars at night and go hustling around the goddamn street,  she might get a f*** stuck in her once in a while. 
[01:15:30]  I don't understand where these questions are coming from, Tom.  That's about it from Manager's Corner.  Go f*** yourself and the f*** with your show coming up next on the Baltimore Oriole Baseball f***ing network.  Yeah.  Is that the best or what?  Is he still living, Earl Ever?  Yeah, I believe so.  Oh, he's just the greatest ever.  If you turn up the computer, I got a little clip I want to play.  Fun little clip.  What?  Oh no, this is actually good for me.  I'll do it. 
[01:16:00]  Hold on.  Ready?  I know what you're playing.  Hold on.  Playing all our baseball bits today or clips.  Go ahead.  So the winning run is at second base with two out.  Three and two to Lukey Wilton.  Little roller up along first.  Behind the bag!  It gets through Buckner!  Here comes Knight and the Mets win it! 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  That's a favorite.  Yeah, that was a tough one.  All right, when we get back, hopefully we'll talk to Jay Moore.  Jay!  Someone's going, you guys are holding off Jay Moore until 520, right?  What?  Are you crazy?  It's not a 520 bit, my friends.  No.  It was just that he was a little busy and he had a delay a little bit.  What the hell's he got to do?  It's not a 520 bit.  He's taping stuff from more sports.  Debuts tomorrow on ESPN, Anthony.  Yeah.  Let's go to the FU line and see what's going on today.  Thanks for calling and here's the open Anthony FU line. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, I'm going to leave a big FU to my boss and his little bitch boy.  They rolled out of work early so they could go watch baseball.  The first and the last days of the month are all our busiest times.  And those two just leave and go watch baseball.  Hope you both get drunk, throw up on each other, get in a drunken driving car accident.  Mess your new car up and both spend the night in jail and get poked in the pokey.  You faggots.  Thanks a lot, you fem little girls. 
[01:17:30]  Change your tampon.  Go f*** yourself.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to give a big FU out to Akron, Ohio for having some crappy weather.  Yeah, I want my spring break and there's six inches of snow on the ground.  F*** you.  Next message.  Big FU to those cheap motherf***ers who order pizza.  F***ing set now in New York.  Listen, you dumbasses.  First of all, I'm working for a goddamn limit.  So don't have your f***ing kids answer the goddamn door, all right?  I don't need...  Oh, look, a little drop into the door.  It takes them five years and answer the f***ing door.  Don't need that f***ing s***.  Second of all, do me a favor, all right? 
[01:18:00]  Order pizza so you know it's coming.  Have the f***ing money ready.  He'll be, like, opening the door.  Oh, my God!  Pizza's here.  Who sent me pizza?  You ordered it, you f***ing dumbasses.  So pay for it.  Got your f***ing money ready.  FU.  End of message.  You got a war face?  What the F?  Ah!  That's a war face.  Now let me see your war face.  No!  Oh, s***.  You didn't convince me.  Let me see your real war face.  No! 
[01:18:30]  No!  You don't scare me!  Work on it!  Jackass.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  WNEW.  This is The Opie and Anthony Show in New York.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else outside of New York.  866-2774.  Wow!  A lot of people from Boston are a little annoyed with my choice of sports clip.  I'm starting at the feeling you don't like Boston, Anthony. 
[01:19:00]  I love Boston.  Mike, what's going on?  F-U-U jackass.  Oh, come on.  What a beautiful day.  Opening day.  I'm driving around.  I'm feeling good.  And I just found...  You know, I learned something today already, guys.  Go ahead.  A 10-second pick can ruin your day.  Oh, stop.  It wasn't that bad.  Dude, they played a clip from the Mets game today.  What's the big deal?  Yeah.  I think Anthony doesn't like Boston anymore.  What clip are they talking about? 
[01:19:30]  Don't do it again, boys.  Have a good night.  Could it?  Could it?  What clip?  What's the problem?  He knows how to get under the skin of the Boston fans, Anthony.  What?  It's not nice, Anthony.  It's not nice, Anthony.  Do they...  I think maybe people might be confused as to what clip it is.  Maybe I should play it again.  It's not...  Which clip is it?  No, it's not nice.  You know, they've been very supportive of our show in Boston.  I know.  I understand.  Remember your route.  Yeah, remember. 
[01:20:00]  Remember where we made our names.  Yeah.  It was in Boston.  Oh, right.  I just, you know, it was a big day.  It's not nice.  And they're fighting for a game right now, so let us live it.  All right.  Pedro looked great today, by the way.  Yeah.  F-U.  Yankees suck.  Yankees suck.  Yankees suck.  Keep chanting that.  That's why I play the goddamn clip.  That's all you hear when you go there.  We're being so...  Church in the supermarkets.  It doesn't matter where you are.  We're being so honest with our listeners.  Mm-hmm.  And they still think April Fool's pranks are happening left and right today.  April Fool! 
[01:20:30]  Our show is going off the air in two cities.  Yeah.  Boy, will you be surprised when you realize it's not an April Fool's prank.  And then other people thinking that Jay Moore was going to...  We were stalling in that Jay was going to call in at 520.  No!  And I told you guys no, he'll call as soon as he's not busy anymore.  And here he is, our buddy, our pal...  Jay Moore!  Jay Moore!  Gentlemen, I've been getting reports on the West Coast of Brewers destroying on the show,  Norton's destroying on the show.  I just hope I can semi-destroy on the show. 
[01:21:00]  I'm in good hands.  What's up?  Don't you worry about it.  Jay, we talked Friday.  Yeah, we did.  Hold on, hold on.  You weren't too crazy about the idea I floated you.  All right, hold on.  You've got to go with this, because you kind of said,  I don't really want to talk about this on the air.  No, no, we've got to do it.  All right, because it was so effing funny to me,  and I was laughing so hard because I know what Ant's reaction would be.  I have not told Ant about your idea.  Let me just preface this by saying more sports debuts tomorrow night on ESPN. 
[01:21:30]  Yes.  What time, Jay?  10 o'clock, right after a repeat of season on the brink.  Oof.  I could give a rat's ass about Bobby Knight.  And it'll be every Tuesday at 10?  I think from then they're moving us to, like, I don't know,  we're on after billiards or something.  Oh, so they're going to, like, throw you all over the place?  No, no, no.  It's going to be 10, and that's what I'm locked in on.  So I don't even know.  I think the following week it's like at midnight or something.  They're promoing the hell out of the show.  It's hilarious.  It's amazing.  I'm watching baseball because I've got my rotisserie team all set up. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  I'm already in the books with, you know, the home run from Sheffield.  I'm already kicking everyone's ass.  And then I see my own promo come up in the corner of the screen,  right when Fernando Vina takes a ball off his nutsack.  That's pretty exciting stuff.  Yeah.  Right.  But my head was right below his nutsack.  All right.  So you call me Friday after the show.  All right.  Here's the deal, Anthony.  All right.  I want you guys on the show, obviously.  We talked about it forever.  And I haven't forgotten.  But when I got a moment to think of something.  Jay, Jay, I've got to interrupt you. 
[01:22:30]  Jay takes care of his friends and he wants to put Ant and I on ESPN.  And you guys will be on the show.  I would be flattered.  And I will fly you out myself if it comes down to that.  So he gives me his first idea on Friday.  How hard was I laughing, dude?  You laughed so hard that Sandy from the other room screamed,  Are you okay?  I've never seen his face that red.  Anthony, here's the idea.  You know Saturday Night Live, they have a cold open?  Right.  Okay. 
[01:23:00]  We want to do a cold open for the show.  Okay.  We're working on Ozzy Osbourne right now.  Are you kidding, man?  Are you going to get Ozzy on the show?  Well, he was in.  He was out.  Now it's 75.  Then it was 80.  Then it was 70.  But you can't miss what you never had.  So F him.  And we're going to be fine if we have him or not.  It'd be nice to have him.  But we also have the rapper Rakim.  We have Slayer booked.  Everyone's in the books.  We're all good.  Sharon, get me on that show, Sharon.  So here's the idea, Anthony.  For you guys to be on more sports in the cold,  I think this would be awesome.  All right.  Sell it, Jay. 
[01:23:30]  Sell it.  I'm getting a massage.  Okay.  In the ESPN, wherever you would go at ESPN Studios to get a massage.  All right.  Barry crashes through the door.  My manager, Barry Katz.  Uh-huh.  And says, Jay, what the heck are you doing?  You're on the air in five seconds.  I say, well, I thought I'd relax by getting a massage from the ESPN masseuses.  Played by you and Anthony.  You and Opie.  What?  What?  Let me finish.  What? 
[01:24:00]  You're dressed in royal white like the good humor man.  But you're real masseuses.  Okay?  Hold on.  Wait, wait.  No, no, no.  I didn't even give it a good time.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  We will stop being for a while.  Wait, wait, wait.  No, there's not.  I don't even want to stay for the ending.  Hold on.  Let me, let me get this straight.  I am trying to put you on television.  Let me get this straight.  We are massaging Jay Moore.  That is correct.  In the right suit, like white pants, white shirt, white shoes. 
[01:24:30]  Got ourselves a pretty little faggot.  So I told Barry, I thought I'd relax before the monologue by getting a nice massage from  the ESPN masseuse.  Uh-huh.  Barry looks at me and says, Jay, ESPN doesn't have masseuses.  Oh.  And then I look at you two guys and then you two guys just basically say, we just wanted  to meet Ozzy.  And you pack up and you leave.  And then I look at Barry and I say, we tell no one. 
[01:25:00]  Okay.  Terrific.  I knew you would have got that out of me.  No matter the time, you bastards.  So, again.  You just don't want to play a guy that would massage another guy.  Again, I must say, we are massaging Jay Moore.  Stupid.  Are you kidding me?  I will say this.  Yeah.  The marijuana intake, when I thought of that idea, might have been a little greater than 
[01:25:30]  normal.  Oh, jeez.  I don't want to get the AIDS, fellas.  But Opie's still laughing.  But Opie's still laughing.  Great simple words.  I am gay.  He's laughing three days later.  I am laughing now.  And Opie, yes, has been laughing for three days.  So, what is it supposed to be sexy?  What part of your body are we massaging?  Good question, Opie.  Like it matters.  I think in the script that was actually written up.  Yeah.  Because I told my writers to get this on the fast track. 
[01:26:00]  Right.  For the sole purpose, we have to get Opie and Anthony on television.  Uh-huh.  I believe you move from my thigh to my calf.  Ah!  You're insane.  Your legs.  My legs.  I don't need to be...  But you're real.  But look, you're not gay.  You just wanted to meet Ozzy.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  I don't...  I don't...  I don't want to be on TV that bad.  You're gay.  But you know what, gentlemen? 
[01:26:30]  We're talking about it, which is a good thing.  We're going to make it happen.  They're all pink on the inside.  Oh, that's one way to look at it.  So, if we're working as that is the worst case scenario...  Right.  We're going to come up with madcap fun for the three of us to get down.  You stupid faggot!  Sorry, Frenchy.  So, who has to massage the thigh and who gets to massage the calf?  Because I'm thinking if I'm massaging the calf, it's less gay at least.  Well, I thought only Anthony would massage me and Opie would be sort of an instructor 
[01:27:00]  telling him the muscles.  Oh, yeah.  I am.  Saying, okay, that's nice.  The quadricep.  Make sure you get all four.  That's why it's called a quad.  And Anthony says, right.  Got it.  You can act like a man!  What the hell are you doing?  Get on your knees and bang like a dog!  It's what I do.  It's all I do.  Why'd you get dice to massage you?  Look what he's doing now.  Now look at me.  Look at me.  Look what he's doing now.  Look at me.  Stupid.  Norton, what do you think of that idea?  Dude, just to meet Ozzy, I don't know, man. 
[01:27:30]  If the sketch doesn't go in real life, I'll give you a hummer if you can put me in a scene  with him.  But you can't say that.  I'm not going to deny that it's gay.  It's funny, though.  Eric on Line 7 goes, did Jay just come out of the closet?  No.  No.  In fact, gentlemen.  Yeah.  Opie's still laughing at the thought of Anthony massaging my thighs.  Don't just stare at him.  I was laughing so hard the other night because I know how Ant would react to something like 
[01:28:00]  that.  I'm shaking hands.  I'm shaking hands.  I'm shaking hands.  And this.  Oh, Anthony.  Yeah.  That guy that said that thing in the post about what you were worth.  Yeah.  Is that all resolved?  Oh, yeah.  That's taken care of.  Dominic Barber.  Yeah.  I was a lawyer.  Really?  Oh, God.  Every time the guy opened his mouth, I would just look at the jury and go, 100 million.  Everything this guy says started with him publicly saying something 99 million away from 
[01:28:30]  the truth.  And he didn't call the lawyer or the judge.  Right.  He decided to take it publicly to let you know for the strict purpose to mislead you.  Consider the source.  Yeah, but 100 million.  Jay Moore, attorney at law.  I'd love to be an attorney.  Wouldn't that be fun?  You could say whatever you want.  Just withdraw it.  That's why I'd be like, well, she's a whore.  Withdrawn.  Never mind.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what they do.  She slept with Rick Delgado.  We didn't know that.  Withdrawn.  And it's withdrawn.  It's not on the record. 
[01:29:00]  But you still said it.  They still have it in their heads when they go into that little room and wonder if O.J.  killed people or not.  People are now asking.  Tom from Philly wants to know if I have to give you a happy ending with the massage.  No, there is no pull release written into the sketch.  But, you know.  And how naked are you on this table?  Good question, Opie.  How naked, Jay?  Let's try to see if we can come to an agreement.  So, you know what?  This is a good sign because we're working together for a happy medium.  I am a happy medium.  I just can't believe Anthony didn't put the kibosh on it right away. 
[01:29:30]  Oh, he did.  But he just asked me how dressed I was.  So he's still thinking about it.  Opie asked how dressed you are.  We're just trying to get another five minutes out of this for our show.  Oh, I will.  Are you naked?  You got a towel on?  Are you on your chest or on your back?  Well, if I was naked, it would just be to show off the pipes a little bit.  The pipes?  All three.  So you'll just have like a towel around your waist?  No, I think I'd probably be in a robe.  Will you be on your back?  Oh, my God. 
[01:30:00]  My wife last night told me I laugh like Burt Reynolds and I think she's right.  Uh-oh.  That's a bad news.  Look, now we're getting people saying, is Jay's new show more sports or more fags?  Come on.  This is just an idea I had.  And this is not the type of threesome aunt enjoys.  But, you know, the bottom line is that was an idea that's not going to take for you two.  Uh, yeah.  However.  It's a cute idea.  It's cute. 
[01:30:30]  It's too fake.  Just say it.  It's too fake.  He pitches something that we're not going to do.  So then the real pitch seems so doable.  Right.  Is that it, Jay?  You're a shrewd one.  Yeah.  Well, look, you guys got to get on the show.  We're going to get you on the show.  I would be honored to be honored.  Everyone knows.  Everyone that works here knows that you guys are eventually going to be on this show.  So you guys would, I would be honored to have you guys on the show because it's what we  always talked about, what we would do for one another.  And I just think that's, you know, you got to do it for your friends. 
[01:31:00]  You guys.  Yeah, but let's, uh, a little less gay.  Yeah.  A little less gay?  A little less gay.  Anyway, because of the gayness of it, I'd pass up the role on your show to do a cameo  on Oz as some guy's prag.  Hey, with Jim Brown in jail, we could do Celebrity Oz right now.  Celebrity Oz.  That's a funny idea.  Yeah, that's good.  I asked one of the black guys in the office, I said, how does he feel about Jim Brown fasting?  And he went, yeah, Jim Brown fast.  And I was like, no, he's fasting. 
[01:31:30]  But Jim Brown's got to be careful.  You know what happens to weak guys in prison?  Yeah.  Wow.  Jim Brown could cut out both his legs and roll his torso through the jail and guys would  part like the Red Sea.  It's like the sheriff's cell with Jim Brown.  Good God.  All right.  So something less gay.  This is my second idea.  Jay, I have an idea.  Something less gay.  Maybe they can roll around, make it on the floor with Matthew Shepard.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Now people are asking me if I do it if Jay was in the Chris Walken character. 
[01:32:00]  You know what?  Gay.  That makes it less gay?  No, that's still gay.  Let's hear the pitch as Christopher Walken.  Maybe something will come to light here.  Sure.  Look, gentlemen, I appreciate you giving me a massage before my first show.  You kept me pumped up.  That's a little too hard on my thigh.  Thank you.  But I am breathing.  Look, gentlemen, I need a pull release at the end. 
[01:32:30]  I need the early bird special and go heavy on the oil.  Yeah.  And before you finish, I'm talking to Anthony.  Make sure that this watch find itself in my ass.  No, I got a different.  Anthony, this one's just for you.  All right.  All right.  So this is idea number two.  Okay.  Number two.  Here we go.  Me and Anthony in my office at Moore Sports, which premieres Tuesday at 10 o'clock.  Right. 
[01:33:00]  ESPN.  Are doing blow off Tara Reid's ass.  Nice.  Okay.  So far, I'm in.  Anthony says, all right, I'm all pumped up.  Let's get to it.  I look down at my crotch, and I say, uh-oh.  And then, oh.  So you guys, we leave.  America's left with the impression that you and Anthony, not only are you such good friends  and such good counterparts and so good for one another on the air as well as off the air, 
[01:33:30]  that when you fly coast to coast to be on a friend's show.  To put Tara Reid on the rotisserie.  Right.  And I'm the one that's worse for it, because I already shot my load in my pants.  So that's the second idea.  Right.  That's the second idea.  Most of that made the...  Third idea.  Hold on, hold on.  Most of that made the air...  Yeah, I would think so.  We're tag-teaming Tara Reid. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, we get to...  In that scenario.  Yeah, we get to put her on the rotisserie.  I thought I explained it expertly as far as radio censorship.  You did pretty good, and then you lost it in your pants or something.  Okay.  That day?  You were.  It happens.  So now not only do we know that you two are down with the rotisserie.  Hold on, hold on.  Just to let you know, they are dumping like crazy.  Are they?  That's insane.  If I was Dr. Laura, I could say.  Maybe the Pope's shaking extra. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, he's shaking a lot and hitting the button, hitting the button.  As he sits back there.  Hey, Jay, as long as you don't combine the two ideas and having you finish prematurely while I massage your leg.  No, no, no.  Because that's, you know.  And this is the, I didn't even get to the third idea.  Uh-oh, there's a third idea?  All right.  This is the best one.  I like you finishing while he's massaging your thigh, and in the credits, you see Anthony with an eye patch. 
[01:35:00]  And then Anthony says, we tell no one.  Right.  All right.  This is the new idea.  This is the third one that I think is the one that's really going to put it over the top.  Does it involve Tara Reid again?  No.  All right.  I'm out.  It also does not involve Opie.  Oh, wow.  How does this happen?  It's in a steam room.  It's Opie, Jeff Garcia, and Cordell Stewart.  No.  Jay.  Already, no.  Steam room.  You're at Plato's Retreat.  You're at Plato's Retreat, and you're the towel boy. 
[01:35:30]  Okay.  Forget that, then.  All right.  No steam room.  Cordell Stewart, Jeff Garcia, and Anthony in the steam room.  No one's touching each other.  Right.  Because that would be gay.  Right.  If those three guys touched each other, one threw for 4,000 yards, and, you know, one  of those three isn't gay.  So we're in the steam room.  So Anthony, Cordell Stewart, and Jeff Garcia in the steam room.  Right.  Okay. 
[01:36:00]  Okay.  Oh, God.  Here we go.  Okay.  Okay.  Now, it's a sports show.  You have to keep in mind.  Uh-huh.  Greg Louganis enters.  Who?  I don't want to ruin it if I answer who.  And he falls down and splits his head wide open.  Just to make it a little more interesting.  And everyone's running out screaming, I don't want to get the age.  Right.  Now, that is funny.  And then one of the three of Anthony, Cordell, or Jeff says, well, I already have it. 
[01:36:30]  Ah, there's the joke.  I got nothing.  I just wanted to hear Anthony's reaction to the massage skit.  The massage skit is quite gay.  When he told me this Friday, he was dead serious.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But then, you know what?  When I slept on it, you know, it is like saying, hey, look, we're his friends and we massage his legs.  Right.  I say you put one, you have it yourself on a table with just a towel showing off that terrific body.  And you have maybe Opie on the feet and Anthony on the shoulders or vice versa.  You've got to have one on each end of you. 
[01:37:00]  And then what?  What are you talking about?  It goes wherever it goes.  It's even close to that happening.  I'm just saying.  That's the massage.  You get two massage.  You don't want them both on the legs.  You have one on the legs and one on the shoulders.  Well, Jim, it's my sketch, my show, my massage.  If I want four man hands on my thigh, I'm going to get it.  Theoretically, Opie could be on one leg and I could be on the other.  It could be.  Yeah.  In a world that ain't going to happen.  Jay, you still got to do that opening just so we could all laugh.  All the listeners of the show.  Oh, my God.  Imagine tuning in to more sports and you see the opening that we turned down. 
[01:37:30]  That we turned down.  And you have, like, gay Broadway dancers doing it.  The joke would be that it's not even that gay.  That's what you're missing.  Oh, jeez.  The joke's on us then.  No, the only thing gay is, like, your white outfits.  Your massage outfits.  No.  I don't think the outfits are the gayest thing.  Me touching your leg is the gayest thing.  But you weren't massaging me because you were gay and you wanted to have, like, gay sex.  You were just two guys from Long Island that figured out a way to get into the studio to watch the show. 
[01:38:00]  And that's by BSing your way into massaging the host.  And that's exactly what the viewers are going to think when they see you at night.  Massaging your thighs.  Jay, when you're laying there and we're massaging, are you, like, laying down going,  Oh.  No.  Oh.  Because that would make me seem gay.  That would make me seem gay.  And people already think I'm gay.  Ugh.  Okay.  Reach under the towel.  New idea.  Oh, no.  No, no, I'm joking.  No, so that idea is dead and buried. 
[01:38:30]  But we're going to shoot it anyway with somebody else.  And you guys are going to go, you know what?  That son of a bitch was right.  It's funny.  Hey, Jay, do you have any other news today?  Yes, I do.  Would you like to share?  My wife is pregnant.  Oh, nice, man.  Oh.  Congratulations.  It's been a soap opera on our show for at least two years.  Wow.  Jay finally got the job done.  Yeah, we pulled the goalie.  Yeah.  Jay, it's a sports show.  You pulled the goalie.  Yeah, because, you know, we heard you had a low sperm count. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, the doctors told us it was .2% chance of us having a child.  Wow.  So.  He said, you know what?  I will never allow Western medicine to strip me of hope.  Uh-huh.  So that guy can kiss my ass.  We fired him.  Jay, is this baby going to pop out looking like Nomar Garcia-Para?  I hope so, if he can hit.  I don't care what he looks like, and I don't care who the father is.  I know it's not me.  You want to explain how this was accomplished?  To hold the goalie.  Because I think it's pretty interesting.  In vitro. 
[01:39:30]  In vitro, Anthony.  Yeah, a little in vitro.  Where the funny, he was telling me this, and I was laughing really hard, too, because  I guess you guys look at your little men under the microscope and decide which one you want.  Yeah, you actually look at all the different people.  Oh, wow.  Ain't that a crap shoot.  And they grade them, A through C.  They grade his sperm.  I'm a good swimmer.  I'm a good swimmer.  Some of the sperm literally are sitting there like a dog after you show them a card trick.  And don't dump out of this, you ass.  Yeah.  We're allowed to talk about this. 
[01:40:00]  So they grade them, and then you decide which one you want.  Wow.  And, you know, you're playing God right there, man.  No, no, no.  We're not.  We're not.  Why, you pick, like, ten, and then he picks one of them?  No, because you just want, you want all A's.  You want tadpoles that are all A's.  I don't want to get dumped, so I'm trying to be, because you have a retard on the button up there.  You're right.  Who does do the button?  He was in vitro, and they picked a Z.  That's a clue, baby.  Where are the buttons?  It swam around in circles and wanted cotton candy. 
[01:40:30]  Retard.  Fish sticks are good.  Did you get to check out your tadpoles?  Yeah, I did.  I looked at them with a microscope with another guy.  And if you think there's a faggy feeling in this lifetime, there's no more faggy feeling than walking into a room with a cup of clam chowder and handing it to another man.  And then he says, great, let's take a look.  Everything's absolutely normal right now.  As long as he doesn't say shots? 
[01:41:00]  I can hope, though.  Hey, Jay, just as a goof, did he point out some retarded ones for you, like all that one?  Oh, yeah.  No, don't pick that one.  That's a Philip Wurfman.  And what was wrong with some of those?  They just came out like, you know, they were just high.  Yeah, not good.  My wife's like, you had to ride a bike and wear tight underpants and smoke pot every day.  Nice job on the sperm count.  Little, little cell-sized hockey helmets on them.  China smashed through the egg.  One of them actually had a Division of Motor Vehicles employee identification card. 
[01:41:30]  That's a bad one.  You steer clear of that.  No, that's the one we're using.  Oh, great.  Wouldn't you love to be a doctor like that just to look at it?  Could be arranged.  Why is that not dunked out of?  Because it was all in code, my friend.  It's all in vagueness.  I don't even know what we're talking about.  It needs to be the code.  All perfectly shaven back there.  Won't dump out of that.  Jim could have been talking about a friendly scribble.  We don't know.  Right.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  You can't say that. 
[01:42:00]  You can't say that?  Of course.  So then what?  You pick out the ones you want, and then what happens?  We don't pick out anything.  They just make sure that they're dealing with strictly A's.  Ah.  And the egg is the egg.  What determines an A, though?  What?  What determines an A?  Oh, I'll tell you.  Motility.  Motility.  Strength of character.  They actually give them also a wonderlick test.  Strength of character? 
[01:42:30]  They get a wonderlick test like the NFL draft.  How well he can hit to the right field?  Exactly.  Lefties.  Right.  Mike Piazza was hit four times this spring, gentlemen.  Really?  Yes, we know that.  He's used to it.  And then he choked a minor league pitcher after the game.  Well, he finally fought back.  Yeah, five innings later when the kid got his back to him walking to the showers.  He needed to do something, though.  He was so mad he got in his eye rock and could not even be soothed by the sounds of Journey. 
[01:43:00]  All right.  So we have the tadpoles.  You pick them out, and then what?  Then they just say, tadpole, meat, egg.  In some kind of a test tube environment, huh?  Wherever Jim Norton goes, that's where they do it.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Tommy.  What's up, guys?  What's up?  Dude, I don't know what you've been talking about.  They're dumping out of everything.  That line before when you said they didn't dump out on Norton, they dumped that out on two.  I don't know what you've been talking about. 
[01:43:30]  They dumped out of...  J-Mo, big fan, by the way.  Can't wait to see your show.  Thanks, brother.  I appreciate it.  No problem.  But I don't know what anybody's talking about.  Oh, they might have dumped out of this thing I said that was...  I said intentionally get dumped out of Norton.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Before that, when you said, oh, I'm talking in code, that Harry Baxter...  Oh, yeah.  They get dumped out of that.  Why would they dump out of that, you faggot?  A splash on the chin thing?  Of what?  I didn't mention anything?  Of course you didn't.  See you later, guys.  Wow. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, they...  They dump out of...  He dumps out of stuff.  Look at the dump button.  That is ridiculous.  Let's make sure once and for all we're all on the same page.  This masseuse thing is going to go down, right?  No.  I want to hear more...  You guys are going to come on the show, right?  Help out?  I would love to.  I think that would be really cool.  Opie and Anthony on ESPN.  We'll piggyback it with Slayer or some really cool guest.  Gay Marco says he wants to massage your third leg in that gag, if that's possible.  It was only a matter of time.  Underneath the towel. 
[01:44:30]  It was only a matter of time.  Of course.  How about it and I are part of an in vitro skit?  In vitro skit.  You're there and you're looking at your tadpole.  Tadpole with my head on one.  Oh, now you're talking some CGI magic.  CGI magic.  There you go, yeah.  There's a tadpole with Opie's head on it.  Right.  And Opie looks up like, oops.  And looks at me like, I'm going to be mad.  Yeah.  And then Sandy walks in and says, honey, are you ready?  And I look at Opie and I go, it's okay. 
[01:45:00]  And then I leave with Sandy.  Well, no, no.  How about you go, where the hell are the samples?  And O and A both walk in and go...  Into a petri dish.  But see, Jim, that's actually incorrect.  Because the sample can be altered by DNA.  That's why when you go in the room to put the dolphins in the tank by yourself...  Right, right.  ...you can't have spit or like your wife...  Really?  I didn't know that.  DNA might just screw it up. 
[01:45:30]  Hope old Goody Gumdrops didn't jump out of that one.  What do you got, Lawrence Welk on the button?  Oh, no.  Worse.  No on that hip.  Worse.  What's his name?  Bag of Douche.  Bag of Douche.  You're allowed to.  See, you know something?  I'm going to go...  I'm going to...  When we go to break, I'm going to go down the hall.  I'm going to go to the perfectly tanned Ken Stevens, freshly back from his vacation, if  he's still here, and say, why can't we talk about this? 
[01:46:00]  Why can't we use the SP word?  Because that seems to be the problem when we're discussing this.  We're not discussing an entire batch.  We're talking about the cells themselves in a context that is completely safe to talk  about.  And why can't you say prematurely jocka jocka?  Right.  You can say that.  He's even dumping out words like...  Wow, that almost really, really hurt me. 
[01:46:30]  What happened?  I went for the dump button, Opie threw the mic, and it really came close to my face.  And broke a light bulb.  Sorry.  Now would be a great time for Paul Bond to run in and grab Opie.  Wow.  He just effed up a whole segment.  This is funny, interesting stuff, you ass!  Go get another job!  You don't know what the eff you're doing down the hall!  Right!  Holy crap!  Okay, I got it.  I got the idea. 
[01:47:00]  You guys play the censors for more sports.  Yeah.  We'll dump out of everything.  No, no, no.  And everything I think I can't say, you guys are like, no problem.  We need a new dump guy.  Yeah.  A dump guy that understands our show, understands content of a radio show, and the law.  I'm sick of this crap.  We just did 20 minutes of really, really funny, creative, interesting stuff, and the 
[01:47:30]  whole thing was chopped to crap.  Go get another job.  You don't know what the eff you're doing anymore.  You're being overcautious, and you're effing up our radio show.  You know, I think of the guy that's driving...  When you start dumping out of words like stuff, you got the problem.  Company man.  I think of guys driving a UPS truck on the Long Island Expressway, and all he wants to  do is listen to Opie and Anthony, because it makes his miserable drive home better, 
[01:48:00]  and this show is designed for specifically that guy, and now that guy's getting half  a show.  I'm sick of this, because Anthony and I know the rules better than the guy that's supposedly  dumping.  Absolutely.  Give us all the stupid dump buttons, and we'll dump out of our own show.  I don't need you down the hall effing with us anymore.  If we didn't know...  Craig, Craig, Craig, you don't know what you're doing.  Yeah.  Go down the hall and resign.  You're screwing this show up.  Go down the hall and resign.  Face facts.  You don't have a freaking clue. 
[01:48:30]  Can we say this guy's name on more sports?  He decided because we made it obvious that we were talking about the SP word that now he's  getting dumped out of everything.  Everything.  That's not how it works.  That is not how it works.  You don't even know that that isn't how it works.  That's not how it works.  Jesus.  Why don't you just have somebody go in there and get Billy Hayes, a lot of machines, to  go in there and give the guy a beating?  Yeah, well.  What do you mean, yeah, well, Imus?  Yeah, well.  Yeah, well. 
[01:49:00]  What the hell did I break?  The light bulb up there.  Which one?  I was showered in glass and a big, heavy microphone whooshed past me as I lunged for the dump button  to dump out of your F word.  And my shoes fell off and my glasses broke.  And now I don't know what to do.  I burnt myself on the light bulb piece.  I'm suing you for $130 million.  And then on top of it, we need some kind of system in place because when he's dumping out 
[01:49:30]  like that, we don't know he's dumping out like that.  So now it's 20 minutes of wasted radio.  Yeah.  Wasted radio because the listeners can't follow what we're doing, Craig.  There is no.  Someone has to run down the hall and go, look, this is no good, no good, instead of putting  20 minutes of crap on the radio.  There's no reason Jay cannot explain his in vitro fertilization and use medical terminology. 
[01:50:00]  And then as we goof on things, we goof on them using code words.  It's fine.  It is fine.  And find me one transcript of any finable offense that is in that context.  Find me one.  Find me one example.  You won't be able to because it won't happen.  We understand things that are completely defendable, Craig.  You don't.  You're dumping out of everything.  How did Craig get his job? 
[01:50:30]  I don't know.  Why?  What do you mean, how?  How do all the rest of the incompetent people around here get their jobs?  I don't know because I only deal with, like, you two and Rick and everybody else that's  very competent.  Whole list of people.  Well, I don't know what to tell you guys.  Dude.  Look.  You don't understand how funny you are and the whole thing just got dumped out of.  It drives me nuts.  Well, look.  This is what we do now.  We do know that you guys... 
[01:51:00]  Craig, do us a favor.  Next time Ant and I are doing a segment and we completely suck, just don't bout like crazy  so we'll have an excuse to make believe, oh, my God, that was one of the best bits we  ever did.  Yeah.  I can't believe what you guys missed.  You'll have to say suck?  It all depends on the context.  Unless he's dumping.  Then, no, you probably can't say it.  Well, here's a sketch you guys will like.  Not for you two, just a random sketch.  Yeah.  Well, of course, everyone wants to see this on TV.  Things white guys can't say on television. 
[01:51:30]  Mm-hmm.  And I just have two black guys come out and say crazy things like, hey, man, take care  of your kids.  How come there are no fathers at the NBA draft?  Why?  Dominican, you're black.  No?  Nothing?  That's funny.  Yeah, but now we're up, you know, this is Craig guy.  Hey, see, he bummed out the party.  Jack tool.  No, no, he's not going to wreck our party.  There's a little...  He's not going to wreck our party. 
[01:52:00]  Come on, let's be positive.  Well, Jay, we got to go.  We got to go deal with this, so maybe we could...  Yeah, now we got to go.  I have a baseball prediction.  Okay.  Go ahead.  This will be for, you know, I don't know, on Opie and Anthony, the first more sports  2002 baseball prediction.  Our friend, Jose Canseco, with the mullet, will hit 300, and he will hit 35 home runs  and 100 RBIs.  Jose Canseco?  In double A.  Oh, in double A.  Okay. 
[01:52:30]  Well, you guys got apoplectic about that.  Hey, that's a word for stoner spelling, B.  Oh, dump out of it.  It might be something dirty.  Apoplectic.  No, it means having a heart attack, Craig.  All right.  You know what?  You know what?  Good.  Okay.  Wait a minute, Jay.  What did I say?  You can't use that word.  Even I know that.  And I'm stupid.  I don't know anything about what should be dumped out.  All right, Craig.  You're a know-it-all.  Well, Jay, this segment will sound hilarious when Aunt and I are on vacation and we put all 
[01:53:00]  the beeps in.  Or don't put the beeps in because they didn't have to be in the first one.  Right.  So, someday, people will find out how funny this really was.  Jay, my friend, thank you.  We've got to move on.  Okay, but you guys are down for coming.  We won't do the game masseuse thing, but we're going to do something.  I would love that.  Absolutely.  And I think that's just what America wants to see on television is you guys, and we're  going to make that happen.  All right, fine.  And I'm in a position now to make that happen.  More sports.  That pumps me up.  More sports on ESPN tomorrow night at 10. 
[01:53:30]  I'd like to say hello to everybody in Cleveland.  All right.  Thank you.  I don't know.  I just had to give a shout-out to somebody.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I love you guys, and fire that guy, and we'll be back.  All right.  Thanks, Jay.  We'll be back, and R&A listeners, we'll be back right after this.  Talk, talk, talk, Opie.  Talking, talking out of one's butt crack.  Anthony.  It's a sign of personal confidence.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This show will really give your brain damage.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. 
[01:54:00]  107.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  WNEW.  How does it feel, Craig?  You can't dump out of that word.  Sperm.  Oh, you got an itchy finger, but guess what?  You can't do it.  Sperm.  We were right.  You were wrong.  Yes.  Sperm. 
[01:54:30]  Hey, Columbus, can we send our dump guy to a blue jacket game, please?  Say it, Anthony.  It feels so good.  Sperm.  Sperm.  Sperm feels good.  Say it without music.  Can I just say it once?  Go ahead, Norton.  Sperm.  I want Ken Stevens to say sperm.  Ken.  Sperm. 
[01:55:00]  There you go.  There you go, Craig.  There you go.  A lot of dumps.  Let me read the dump sheet.  Go ahead.  Read of the dump sheet.  Here.  It's right in front of you.  Put it down next to Anthony.  Let us read of the dump sheet.  All right.  There you go, Ken.  You got that?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  See?  No. 
[01:55:30]  Let's see.  Dumped out.  5.08 p.m., O.P.  Jim Norton saying, imagine that stuff dumped on your chin.  Ugh.  And it was, imagine that stuff splashed.  Splashed.  Yeah.  On your chin.  Nothing wrong with that, Craig.  Faggot company man.  It's because you've had some splashed on your chin.  No reason to deprive the rest of us of a laugh.  Sorry.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[01:56:00]  Sorry.  Ah.  You can't even keep.  I know.  I know.  That was an accident.  That was a complete accident.  Ah.  All right.  I dropped the F-bomb.  Sorry.  By the way, Ken, I almost knocked out my partner here.  Yeah.  And the mic came flying around.  And I'm sorry.  It broke one of the light bulbs.  And as I went lunging for the dump button, because Opie yelled the F-word and then slammed  the mic around, it was coming around this way and I was going for the button.  I was like, oh, no! 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  Very, very close.  The only thing that would have redeemed that whole bit would have been me being knocked  out on the floor.  That would have been right in front of Norton, he pulled my pants down and the fun would start.  Two guys.  Double knuckle stuff.  One knuckle down.  Sure.  Smells on your knee, elbow, elbow.  Well, there you go.  Craig, here's a tip, okay?  If we're saying something funny, the listeners want to hear that. 
[01:57:00]  Okay.  All right.  Good.  You got it.  Let's see.  What else got that?  5-11.  And Anthony drinks it?  I can't remember how that was said.  I don't know.  Bob, what's going on?  That was the first time.  No, you guys are always talking about Opie throwing stuff.  I now believe it because Anthony's voice was inferior, man.  Oh, my God. 
[01:57:30]  And Norton, the F-word got over the phone.  That was great.  Hold on.  To defend Anthony, though, this mic came flying around.  They're heavy, too, man.  It would have knocked him out.  Right from my eye.  It would have knocked him out.  I never believed it, but I could just tell by his voice, oh, my God, you really threw it?  I do feel bad, and I'm sorry.  And I don't blame you.  That was unbelievable.  That was great.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's move on with the fine radio show.  Get all pissed off.  I'm just curious.  Like, you know how most people have a job in life. 
[01:58:00]  What happens if you usually, like, can't do your job and you're not good at it?  You what?  You get fine?  Don't they normally just fire you?  I mean, that's fine.  I don't know.  It's just my guess.  What happens?  It's just ridiculous.  Oh, don't, uh, don't make us pull the power play.  Hey, I know of a guy, Anthony.  Yeah.  Scott helps men to find out if their wives or girlfriends are cheating by running DNA tests on their panties. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, really?  Now, if Scott finds that word that is not yours in the panties, then that means she is cheating.  Well, thank you, Weinstein.  Someone does this?  Scott does this for a living.  I guess if you think your chick is cheating on you.  You send them panties.  You get the panties out of the hamper.  Wow.  Yeah, because then...  I love the word hamper. 
[01:59:00]  The hamper.  And then you mail them to this guy, and he'll do DNA tests, and he'll tell you exactly what's going on in the panties.  He'll find mummified sperm cells in there, right?  Well...  Because they're all old.  It's been used before.  And, uh, you know, they die off quickly.  And then, like anything else, dry.  And then he could probably see them under a microscope as he takes samples.  He takes samples.  What would prove that someone's cheating?  Let's use a code word.  Say that you're looking for samples of, uh, Craig's mouthwash. 
[01:59:30]  And if you find evidence of that, you realize that there has been some shenanigans behind your back.  Uh, some kind of hijinks being played on you.  Uh, Dave, what's going on?  Yo, man, I just wanted to be left on hold so I could listen to the show.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  No problem.  Exactly.  It's ridiculous.  All right.  Thank you, Dave.  Thanks.  Bye.  So we're going to get this guy on the phone really fast.  Ah.  I bet he doesn't even do any checking.  He probably just takes them. 
[02:00:00]  Oh.  Yeah, he does.  He's got a fetish.  Yeah, he's got a fetish.  Ladies, I can check your, uh, tinkle.  Do you want to mail it in?  Uh, Clemens gave up a grand slam to the Orioles.  Ah, that's all right.  Oops.  Oops.  Ouch.  Oops.  What is it?  Eight to one?  Oh, it was one-nothing Yanks last time I came.  Wow, I guess the season's over.  No World Series.  Game one.  Oh, jeez.  It's going to be a long year with this baseball crap.  Of course.  Season takes forever. 
[02:00:30]  I'm the only Met fan in the, uh, studio.  Uh, let's go, Met's go.  Uh, Ben is a, a Sox fan.  Do you follow baseball at all?  Greet the Mets.  I love the Yankees, and I remember Jeter before he came up from the minors.  They were talking about him.  Yes, I liked him.  In a paper bag in front of you.  Crinkle, crinkle.  Oh, half and half, are ya?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Harold, what's up?  Hey, you guys are getting dropped in Austin.  Austin? 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  I went down to the studio today to get some WoW stickers.  Yeah.  And, uh, they said they were all out.  They gave them all the way.  Uh-huh.  And it didn't matter because they were dropping you guys this week.  Uh-huh.  All right, thank you.  Yeah.  A lot of people think we're playing a little gag, but two cities, I guess, are dumping the show in the very near future.  Uh-huh.  And when they do, you'll realize that it wasn't an April Fool's prank.  That we were telling you the truth.  Wow.  We're waiting for this guy. 
[02:01:30]  Rick's calling him right now.  Dylan, what's up?  Dylan!  Hey, what's going on?  That's with the chopper.  I lie.  What's up?  I had a friend, this guy that does DNA touching, I had a friend of mine use him about a year ago.  Yeah.  I heard it on Z100, and I gave him the number one time, and he did it, and proved positive it came out saying that she was cheating.  Really?  Yep, he got a little letter back, and apparently he had to send something of his own in order to, you know, tell me.  Right, you've got to get the comparison thing going.  Yeah, so it definitely works. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, well, we've got the guy on the line.  There's so many good questions to ask him.  Oh, my God, look at his website name.  Are we allowed to say that?  Can we say that?  Can you spell it?  Is it E-A-T-A-B-U-L-L-E-T?  Oh, you are a whore.  You're a whore.  I do believe you're allowed to say sementest.com.  Right, because he tests for it.  That's his job.  Because, Craig, we're not describing the semen.  Right.  We're not describing where it goes or what anything is being done with it. 
[02:02:30]  He's testing for the presence of semen.  The old hall matter.  Is what it is.  Exactly.  Loves his job.  No running in the halls.  Loves to tell.  Let's see if Craig does the right thing, okay?  I'll show you.  I'll give you a little test.  The word is semen.  The password.  This should not be dumped out of.  We're going to talk to a guy named Scott who has a website called sementest.com.  Right.  This you're supposed to dump out of. 
[02:03:00]  Scott.  It's waiting.  Waiting.  Yeah.  Waiting.  Why is that even wrong if it's true?  All right.  So you gave him a test.  You show that you know that isn't supposed to be on the air.  Right.  Something of that graphic nature.  Right.  And you want to see if he dumped out of it.  And he should have.  Okay.  He's on the ball.  Okay. 
[02:03:30]  He dumped out of it.  But any.  Good job, Craig.  Good job.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Did you learn that in Dump School 101?  Good job, school.  Good job.  Well.  See, when you describe it, Craig, that's when you're supposed to dump.  Right.  But now, just talking about Scott from sementest.com, now this is perfectly fine.  We will talk about how he tests for it.  And, Craig, guess what?  If we think it might be a little crazy, we're going to use code words.  Is that okay with you, Craig? 
[02:04:00]  All right.  There we go.  We might have to use the word chowder.  Is that okay, Craig?  Uh-oh.  Now you've done it.  What's that, Rick?  Let's talk to Scott.  Scott has a website called sementest.com.  Right.  Scott.  Hey, Scott.  Hi, guys.  Just got to keep our people in order over here.  Sorry, Scott.  All right.  I'm sorry you had to hear all that.  Yes.  And, by the way, I have no clue if it's chunky.  Craig, don't dump out because now we don't know how I use the word chunky. 
[02:04:30]  You're all here.  Chunky soup.  All right, Scott.  Scott.  How are you?  I'm good.  How are you guys doing?  Now, you have a little business here.  Yeah.  And if you guys think their girls are cheating, you send them, or they send you their panties.  Right.  And you test it for another man's semen.  Yeah.  First, we test it for semen.  Right.  Uh-huh.  And to see if there's actual semen there. 
[02:05:00]  Right.  And then we can go forth from that and find out through a DNA test if it's his or not or somebody else's.  Mm-mm.  And if it's someone else's, obviously, she's cheating.  Okay.  I'd think so.  Mm.  Anyway, the guy can gather up DNA from other guys that he knows and send it to you, and maybe you can match it up and he can find out who she's cheating with?  Yeah, he'd have the problem of getting the DNA from the other party. 
[02:05:30]  Well, you kill him and then send a swab of blood.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  No?  Yeah, that would work, but, I mean, you don't recommend that, do you?  No.  You could have gay sex with him and save it.  The obvious question here is if your lady is cheating on you, how is the you-know-what?  See, Craig, because I'm not sure in this context if I can do this.  Yeah.  The you-know-what ends up in the panties.  Oh, she's got to put them on afterwards, so you can't get rid of all that. 
[02:06:00]  No, she will have a discharge or-  Uh-huh.  From the Army.  Yeah.  Yeah, a discharge from the Army.  Uh-huh.  Into her panties.  Yeah.  Sometimes for up to a week.  Wow.  So, you know-  Now, in all fairness to Ned Flanders down the hall, I don't know if that made the air.  I don't either.  You know, that might have been a bit-  That's like a gray area.  A bit descriptive on how it might end up. 
[02:06:30]  Usually the gray area stuff he does dump out of.  I'll just translate, just in case.  Dump or good?  No, we're good.  We're good.  Well, that's-  Scott?  Yeah.  What percentage would you say of guys that send in panties are from cheating girls?  Probably about 40%.  40%.  Well, you've got to figure that the guys do assume that she's cheating and have some reason  to send you the panties.  Yeah, most of them have some reason. 
[02:07:00]  Like, you know, she's out until 3 o'clock in the morning with a co-worker at a bar.  For some sort of reason.  And stayed in a hotel.  Yeah.  Right.  For whatever reason.  Yeah.  Scott, Joe on line 2 says-  I'm going to try.  Joe says, my girlfriend doesn't wear panties.  Can I send her-  Can I send in her mouth?  Send in her what?  You cannot surgically remove a woman's mouth and test that for anything. 
[02:07:30]  I do believe you do need panties for this, right?  Normally.  And Scott, how do the guys send in the sample?  Oh.  Mail.  Just, you know, they put it in an envelope and they send it to us.  Airborne, Express, Federal Express.  The panties are in a baggie?  Yep.  Wait, wait.  What about his sample?  Yeah, his sample.  Oh, his sample?  So he can do the comparison thing. 
[02:08:00]  Well, what we do is we ask him to-  We could either send him a kit or he can just go into a pharmacy and buy some Q-tips.  You could send him a kid?  Kit.  K-I-T.  Now, we're not in the kid business.  So he takes a little-  So he takes the Q-tip and rubs the inside of his cheek.  Yeah, that's right.  Upper cheek.  Ah, all right.  Oh, I thought you were getting another sample.  Yeah.  Oh, no, his cheek's on his face.  No, I know.  Mouth, mouth.  You don't send a swab from any other cheeks or you might get a different result, right? 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I understand.  It actually might work, but anyway.  Sir, can I ask you a question?  Did you ever open the bag and have an awful smell come out of it?  Hey, that's a good-  Like, this girl must work out a lot.  This bag smells like the toe-epping of a rhino.  It always has some sort of an odor, but some people like that.  Do you sniff any of these panties that come to you?  Yeah, anything like, do they send pictures along and, you know, you can take a little whiff. 
[02:09:00]  You ever put them over your head and whack your bag and scream, whore?  Ah.  Scott, are you ever deeply disturbed at some of the stuff that comes in your mail?  Like, oh, my God, it looks like a huge shoe shine rag.  Yeah, anything that need be tested on the back?  Would you ever get a pair that looked like it was from the Bundy crime scene?  Maybe it was, you know, the only time- 
[02:09:30]  We've actually had.  We've actually had it from, I don't know if it was from Janameka or Trinidad.  They sent us, it was man's pants, totally covered in blood.  Really?  Yeah, the front.  You probably killed her.  Yeah, yeah.  You ever get cute little-  I thought he was, it turned out he was cheating.  You get any cute cartoon underoos?  Nothing like that?  Yeah, we get some real nice stuff, too.  Powerpuff girls?  Undies?  Nothing, no? 
[02:10:00]  Grannels?  Any interesting stories that came your way, Scott?  Oh, I don't know.  You know, we found mustache hair in there.  Oh, you did, did you?  Yeah.  Mustache hair.  And it wasn't the guys?  Well, we didn't test for the hair, but, um,  should have told the guy, hey, look, you got a mustache,  because we found a mustache hair.  Wow.  At least you know she was cheating with a trooper.  Hey, hey, he's willing to go the distance.  He bet he is.  Dave wants to know if you do taste testing. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, God.  We offer free tours.  Free tours?  For sniff and taste.  There you go.  Look at you doing the jokes now.  Like a wine testing, uh, taste test.  I understand.  Dad.  Wow.  I bet you that worked on Z100.  Oh, sorry, and we're still in the air.  Hey, could you use this in court, your results?  Uh, normally you can't.  Uh, the testing we do is anonymous testing.  Uh-huh.  And, um, you can't use it in most states, um, you, uh, you can't use this for divorce, 
[02:11:00]  because there's no, most divorces are no fault.  Right.  Right.  Do you get to keep the panties yourself, or?  Oh, yeah.  We got lots of them.  We got a big cabinet full of them.  You don't send them back?  Uh, normally, no.  How do you inform the men that their women are indeed cheating on them?  Well, we either email them, or they call us.  Wow.  Really?  And then what do you say?  Give me, like, a sample.  Okay, I've sent in some panties. 
[02:11:30]  They come back, and they're tainted with another man's seed.  What do you tell me, Scott?  Hi, Scott.  You got problems.  Well, what happened?  Uh, we just, we just tell them that if we found semen.  I was hoping to get a little play thing going, Opie.  Yeah.  I was hoping to get, like, a character thing going.  Like, Scott, I'm on the phone with you, and I have the tainted panties.  Like, how do you tell me?  Because it's kind of an emotional thing, right?  A little role play.  Right.  A little role playing.  Right.  Right.  Okay.  Scott, would you like me to send another badge? 
[02:12:00]  Scott?  So, are you, but you're nice.  You're not like, oh, geez, hey, your hooah is screwing around on you.  No, no.  We actually have to do some sort of counseling with it.  Really?  Because, you know, if, well, there's different types of testing.  First of all, when you start off, if the man hasn't had sex with his significant other,  wife, or whatever, you know, for over a week, and there's semen in there, then you know she's  been cheating because it can't be his. 
[02:12:30]  Well, right.  So then you don't have to go into the DNA test, but if he's fairly active with her and  there's semen, it will be his.  I mean, obviously, he's going to have his semen there, too.  Right.  So then you have to isolate to see if there's other semen there, and then we check for the,  I guess we check for sperm whales.  Oh, there you go.  Say another.  There you go.  That cracked open up.  Do you hear him?  Yeah.  He's crazy like that. 
[02:13:00]  He's ready to throw another mic at my head.  What was the biggest pair of panties you got in the mail?  Oh.  Hey, what's the most you've ever seen on some of these things?  Oh, God.  We got a pair of slacks in.  Black, black slacks.  Yeah.  Guy brings in.  And she wasn't wearing any panties.  Yeah.  And it was pretty gross.  It was running down the legs.  Wow. 
[02:13:30]  That's hot.  And she turned out that she was cheating, and even after she was confronted,  of course, he's divorced her by now.  Right.  And she still wouldn't admit it after found out that it was his best friend.  Oh.  And he admitted it and ended up getting kicked out of the house,  and she still wouldn't admit it.  Wow.  I love the guy that she was cheating with, though, because he didn't even bother.  He just, you know, let it go right there, and go ahead, Peg, put your pants on, and leave.  And leave.  Sounds like muddy shoes and a quagmire. 
[02:14:00]  Doesn't it, Doc?  A quagmire.  Just when you thought we didn't have any more questions for Scott, here's another one.  Fred wants to know if you could tell if the chowder, Craig, I'm using the word chowder.  What?  If the chowder came out of the V or the A.  Oh, that's pretty good.  Yeah.  Is there a way to tell where it came from based on where it is located on the garment? 
[02:14:30]  To see what kind of action your wife or girlfriend was having.  Because maybe, put it this way, maybe some of this event was going on with her face buried in a pillow.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah, you know what I mean, Scott.  Like, well, it's not easy.  I'm figuring out your code description.  Right.  So, can you tell based on where it is in the garment?  No.  No?  Well, how about if you'd find a piece of corn in the chowder? 
[02:15:00]  There you go.  Well, that's great.  Scott, how funny are we?  You're terrible.  You guys are terrible.  Thank you.  Thank you, Scott.  Well, it has been fascinating talking to you, Scott.  And, I guess, go to sementest.com if you have any doubts about your girlfriend's fidelity or wife or whatever.  Right.  Or your boyfriend.  Ooh.  Scott, any other plugs there? 
[02:15:30]  Well, just, you know, sementest.com.  Yeah.  It's got a lot of information.  Do it anonymously.  Is there any way for a girl, is there a test for a woman to maybe test if her husband's been cheating?  Is there anything like that that could be done?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  How is that?  Normally, after a man has had...  Right.  We understand.  He's done.  He is finished, let's say.  He's finished. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  And he will have dripping for about two hours after the act.  Uh-huh.  Right.  Understood.  And...  And, um, so there will be deposits.  Yeah.  In his underpants.  Well, you know something?  You put that under a microscope, it looks like Jurassic Park.  You know what I mean?  There's probably...  No, regardless.  There's just things happening.  So you're saying that the woman should just...  No, there's tadpoles and there's all sorts of things there.  Sir, is it possible to find out for the woman just to cut off his dirty C and mail it to you? 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, there's another thing, too, is that you could find a female's epithelial cells, which are skin cells.  Oh, okay.  So if that ends up in the guy's undies and you find that, and then what?  You do more DNA against the girl or the girlfriend or the wife.  And if it's not hers, then the guy's been cheating.  Right.  Or standing very close to a girl.  Yeah. 
[02:17:00]  God, do you feel...  Naked.  Do you feel bad that some of these guys are just trying to get some loving?  Hmm.  And all the wrong places?  It might be the right place, though, if his lady or...  Or what the hell, the guy is not giving it, you know, to his partner at home there.  Oh, I got a question.  I got a question.  Any little friends inside these things when you open them up?  Do you ever find any crabs or anything like that?  No. 
[02:17:30]  No?  No, and I hope we don't.  How about multiple samples in one pair of panties?  Oh, that's a good one.  Anything like that?  Yeah, that we find.  Oh, she's been put on the rotisserie?  We're looking for the football team or the baseball team, you know.  Oh, my God.  So two guys.  Wait, maybe more than two.  How many?  What's the most different DNA you found in one pair?  We have found two.  Two.  And was one the guy, the sample? 
[02:18:00]  One was the husband, and the other one was somebody else.  No, I just like to think there's, like, five, you know, pinball machines involved.  Did you ever have, like, say a woman sends it in because she thinks her husband has been unfaithful,  and then you check his boxers and you find blood in Girl Scout cookie crows?  Look at Norton cracking himself up.  Wait, let's see if Scott finds that funny.  Scott?  No, it wasn't funny.  No, not at all.  Not at all.  There's 18 cities disagreeing with us. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, we have fun, huh?  Sounds like you have a fun show.  Are you actually on the air?  No.  Yeah, a lot of our guests ask that.  I know, because this doesn't really seem like the run-of-the-mill interview you do, does it?  No.  Yeah.  All right.  Do you ever get a pair of panties from a guy named Craig?  Actually, we have three Craigs.  Which one would it be? 
[02:19:00]  I mean, how do we differentiate?  There was probably a sweater and rosary beads with them.  No.  It wouldn't have been panties, though.  It would have been check the mouth part of a ski mask.  Yeah, we did get a ski mask.  Really?  Why?  Yeah, tell us about this.  This should be good, too.  Yeah.  What about the ski mask, sir?  Did you actually get a ski mask, or are you? 
[02:19:30]  No, I'm making it up.  Ah, you're joking.  You're a card.  All right there, Scott.  It's been very, very educational.  I didn't know this service was available.  Oh, Scott, I have no...  Yes, Opie?  Are you going to use it now?  Um, no.  Use the service? 
[02:20:00]  I have no need for this service.  Do you, Opie?  No.  No.  Rick?  Not that I know of.  No.  Norton?  Well?  Oh, Scott, I have one more question?  Sure.  Oh, God.  Oh, you got him.  Nice.  You got him.  Opie got him.  It was pretty easy to get him, because you just hung up on him.  Ah, poor guy.  Yeah, but he can make it up.  Sure.  Now he's going to call back.  What was that question?  It was all right.  Oh, Scott, click.  All right, well.  That was hot.  Hey, when we get back, why don't we play Latin baseball? 
[02:20:30]  Ah.  It's opening day, and so we're doing some of our baseball things.  One of Rick's more offensive songs.  I mean, his vocal styling's not really the content.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  As we go to break, let's go to the F.U. line, actually.  Let's go to the F.U. line.  Let's go to the F.U. line.  Thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  This is a big F.U. out to Bill O'Reilly for slandering and just mutilating that interview 
[02:21:00]  with O.N.A. and for just being an overall prick with no sense of reason.  If he had any sense of reason, he would have understood that what he's saying is S.9.  F.U.  Bill O'Reilly.  Next message.  Hi, this is E.J.B.  I want to give a big F.U.  to those burnt, crispy pieces of crap, B2K.  I'm sick of those pieces of s***.  Thank you.  Bye.  Next message.  Yeah, this is Rob from Stoyle, and this is a big F.U.  to Lower Chai Ridley and other problems and all your other cheap-ass furrows and talent 
[02:21:30]  partnerships and P.A. who charges contractors 50 to 100 bucks just to work in your piece  of s*** town.  Let me tell you something.  I'm sick and tired of your cheesy-ass talented inspectors.  I have nothing better to do except stick your finger in a donut and follow my goddamn truck  around.  Get a life.  F.U.  Next message.  Hey, I'd like to leave a huge F.U.  to Bill O'Reilly for being an s*** towards Opie and Anthony.  I hope you rot in hell.  F.U.  End of message.  Nothing you can imagine has prepared you for this. 
[02:22:00]  I don't want them enjoying it like exactly.  Sometimes you want to hear...  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show?  Yeah.  My goodness.  Hold on one sec before you get that.  Yes.  I want to play Babe Ruth's audio.  The Babe.  Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. 
[02:22:30]  Oh.  You know how bad my voice sounds?  Well, it feels just as bad.  You know this baseball game of ours?  Coming up from the U.  The only real game I think in the world.  Baseball, you've got to start from way down the bottom.  When you're six or seven years of age, you've got to let it grow up with you. 
[02:23:00]  And if you're successful and you try hard enough, you're bound to come out on top.  Just like these boys have come to the top now.  Thank you.  It's my way, sir.  Yeah.  Happy opening day to everyone.  There you go.  The Bambino.  There he was.  Actually, I thought I was a tape of Pharrell.  Sounded a little like our own Scott Pharrell. 
[02:23:30]  Boys.  So what's going on with EverQuest, Anthony?  Oh, it'll be a tragedy in the news here.  Death of a game addict.  Get this story.  And this tool mother of this tool 21-year-old.  Sean Woolley.  He loved online computer game, an online computer game so much that he played it just minutes before his suicide.  21-year-old Hudson man.  Addicted to EverQuest.  That's your game.  That's the game I play, Opie. 
[02:24:00]  That's your drug of choice.  That's my drug of choice.  It's been called EverQueer, EverCrack.  I'm not alone.  Our own Keith Kopp over here loves the game.  I was like the drug addict who kind of said, hey, Keith, I'm playing this game here.  Why don't you check it out?  Exactly.  Exactly.  And it's a horror show.  It has consumed my life.  It has totally consumed his life to the point where he now, like the first thing he says to me or I say to him when he comes in the building is, dude, what level are you up to, man? 
[02:24:30]  What are you doing?  I call and leave messages on his machine and stuff like that.  Yeah, he leaves messages about what server he's on and what he's got, more equipment.  It just takes up your life.  It takes up every minute of your life.  It's a massive multiplayer online role-playing game, EverQuest.  Great graphics now.  It's 3D virtual world.  They got over 400,000 people worldwide subscribed to this, playing it.  It's what they call a never-ending fantasy game. 
[02:25:00]  Well, Sean Woolley shot himself to death in his apartment.  His mother blames EverQuest.  That is why I unload my gun.  Before I play this game, every single time, and I put the bullets in the car, and I have it padlocked, and I let my girlfriend hold the key.  You have to.  You get angry.  So let me get this straight, because this lunatic shot himself over a computer game.  I swear, you didn't tell me what's going to happen with the story. 
[02:25:30]  She's going to now try to get this game banned, right?  Well, she's going to sue the game, first of all, and try to get some quick cash.  Great.  And then she wants all kinds of new warnings put on these games.  Ha-ha!  That's right, Cartman.  Well, she's hiding attorney.  She blames the game.  It's like any other addiction, Elizabeth Woolley said, the mother.  Either you die, go insane, or you quit.  My son died.  The virtual world of EverQuest, of course, monster-slaying missions and quests. 
[02:26:00]  And the success makes the character stronger as they interact with other characters from all over the world.  And...  Yeah.  Wait, what?  Well, exactly.  Believe me, if you play...  You know the game.  And a lot of people play online gaming.  So you understand what kind of environment you're in.  People say you're very vulnerable to becoming addicted to EverQuest.  This guy, this addiction service worker, says that people who are prone to this are people that are prone to boredom, lonely, sexually anorexic, have low self-esteem and poor body image. 
[02:26:30]  As all of you should.  And they say, they accuse the makers of EverQuest of creating an addictive game.  It could have been created in a less addictive way, but that would be like the difference between powdered cocaine and crack. 
[02:27:00]  And then Parker, this guy from the clinic, goes on to say, talk about a 21-year-old college student who has stopped going to class within eight weeks after starting to play EverQuest in his senior year.  And after playing the game for 36 hours straight, had a psychotic break because of sleep deprivation.  Whatever.  I'll do what I want.  He thought the characters had come out of the game and were chasing him. 
[02:27:30]  I can't wait to get to this point.  That sounds like a pisser.  I want the characters to chase me.  I had those same feelings, you know, staying up all night cramming for a final exam.  Whatever.  He was running through his neighborhood having hallucinations.  I can't think of a drug that could have taken where he would have, oh, a drug that he could have taken, which would have had him disintegrated to the point he was in only 15 short weeks.  Other things they say is Sean Woolley's character in EverQuest could have traumatized him. 
[02:28:00]  He may have had his character slain in combat and not be able to recover it, which is very...  You cannot leave the house until you recover that body.  Let's say...  You cannot turn the computer off.  I'll explain.  I'll explain, Opie.  I understand.  Let's say you're battling in a faraway realm.  But your body, your character, has to be bound to a city. 
[02:28:30]  So when you die, you reappear wherever you're bound.  Now, if you're way far away from the city and you die, now you've got to run without any of your equipment from your city binding point to where you died.  If you don't know where you died, you're lost.  After a week goes by, your body disappears with everything on it.  So everything you've earned, everything that you've played years for, disappears.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  Exactly.  So they're saying that perhaps he lost his body and his goods and his treasures or an artifact. 
[02:29:00]  Or he had been cast out of one of the game's social clubs called Guilds.  Maybe he was an outcast.  Or how about this?  He was a douchebag in real life and should have just gotten a girlfriend and gotten a Hummer.  And I'm glad he shot himself because he saves us the trouble of having to deal with him.  And Elizabeth Woolley remembers her son was betrayed by an EverQuest associate he'd been adventuring with for six months.  Sean's online brother-in-arm stole all of his money from his character and refused to give it back. 
[02:29:30]  Isn't that kind of like real life?  Oh, what a bunch of faggots.  He was so depressed and in tears.  I said he couldn't trust those people.  It's only a game, I tried to tell him.  She didn't understand, Keith.  No, she does not.  She doesn't understand.  There's a buddy of mine that, well, I don't know this person.  He happens to be a fan of the show.  Right.  Or I sometimes group with.  A lot of people online on EverQuest, fans of the show.  Exactly.  My pal, I know him as Brody on the Ionae Row server. 
[02:30:00]  And he happens to be a 19-year-old college student who on a regular basis blows off class or work and spends the whole day.  And who am I to say?  Because I blow off the whole day and will play this game for hours on earth.  Hold on.  You're a cop.  You're not supposed to be blowing off your day.  We kind of need you in the streets of New York.  College kid, whatever.  Somebody will catch them.  Put down the EverQuest there, Keith.  And you were going to ask me, how long is the longest stretch you have played this game? 
[02:30:30]  I would say 14 to 16 hours.  14 to 16 hours.  Get up on a day, like 9 o'clock, just sit in the chair with like a bowl of Froot Loops.  Can you pause it, though, if you go to the bathroom?  No, there's no pause.  No, no, no.  You can't pause it.  If you leave the computer and you're not in a safe spot, you can come back.  And while you were going to the bathroom, let's say a griffin could fly by and kill you.  I wouldn't know what a griffin is.  It's a large, flying, lion-headed creature. 
[02:31:00]  Why are you looking at me like that?  Because it's just awful.  Griffins stink.  You might be able to hide somewhere, but you're never sure, unless you log off, that you're safe.  So a lot of times, if we order out, we order maybe some sushi and the bell rings, I'll get up.  And as I'm paying the guy, I'm looking the other way.  Yeah, take the money.  Give me the food.  And I'm just looking to see if I'm getting attacked.  Is it a griffin, or do they just show an Eddie Griffin movie and your character shoots himself? 
[02:31:30]  I also, since we're on the subject quickly, I must thank Ted Yule and the wonderful people from the Cats and Hats Guild.  That opie, they got me.  They helped me get my epic weapon over the weekend.  And I'm very happy, I am now level 51, Shaman Barbarian, with my epic weapon.  Oh, man.  Yes.  You lost me at, there was a tragedy today. 
[02:32:00]  Hey, Keith, what level are you?  I happen to be a 35 Paladin.  My name is Salvin on the Iona Row server.  I will be trading WOW t-shirts for more equipment.  Oh, look at them.  If anyone cares to send me a message.  Some guy, he just hung up.  I was going to go to him, but he probably had to get back to the game.  Yeah.  He said that he spent five hours making keys.  What does that mean?  Making keys.  I make arrows four to five hours at a time.  I'm an alchemist, so I make things like potions that make people faster, and I can sell them. 
[02:32:30]  Now, wait a minute.  Now, here.  Now, wait a minute.  Why would you make arrows?  Because you could sell them to other players in the game and get platinum, and with that  platinum, you buy better equipment.  But how long does it take to make an arrow?  Oh, Keith, you're the arrow maker, not me.  I could sit for maybe an hour and make $200, maybe more.  As you get better at your skill of making these things, you can make them faster and 
[02:33:00]  cheaper, and you don't have as many failures in your attempts to make them.  Now, we pay to play this game, too.  We pay approximately $10 a month.  Yeah, it's a subscriber.  Or you could pay quarterly.  Now, they just came out with the one-year or two-year agreement for 30% savings of $109  for a year, or $190.  Now, Ant, will you be paying $190?  I have to ask if they have the 10-year plan, because I believe I could get an even better  discount.  All right, how does the game end? 
[02:33:30]  Oh, no.  Actually, we're hearing something.  It says, a shot with a bullet in the head.  Actually, yeah, we do have audio of the game ending.  There it is.  Good night.  Actually, it says, a game without end.  How does it pull people in?  A key component is the game can be played indefinitely.  There's always people populating the online world, and it's the social structure of the  game.  The graphics are thrilling.  They say they just haul you in.  Do you mean forever and ever, Ant? 
[02:34:00]  You can just play forever?  Yes, you can play forever, as long as the game is on there.  This type of thing is becoming huge, where people are more concerned about their online  life than their regular life.  Sean Woolley was overweight, worked in a pizza restaurant, and lived alone in his apartment  the last months of his life.  May have depended on EverQuest, depended on EverQuest to provide the life he really wanted  to live.  Are you making that up, or is that true?  No, that's what it says.  If a fat guy in a pizza place shoots himself, he should have.  If you're fat and work in a pizza place, follow his lead, even if you don't have a computer. 
[02:34:30]  Let me go to Bob.  Bob, what's up?  What's up, man?  I was working.  I played that game for about, I don't know, two months, then I quit my job and played it  for about four months straight.  That was it.  That's all I did.  Actually, my name is Ubermuzzle.  I'm a level 50 necromancer.  Look at Norton's face.  What?  A level 50?  You're a level zero zilch.  I know all about it.  Got to go for it.  All right, Bob. 
[02:35:00]  You're a level zero zilch.  I mean, it's hard to say, because Keith and Anna, my friends, Keith, and I know a cop,  and he lives a life, and Ant, obviously, on the show, lives a life.  So if people are living their lives and doing it, that's fine.  And when I hear them starting to give up school and then blowing their head off, I wish he  would have shot his mother first.  That's the only thing I can say.  We'll see you now once wanting one.  Well, she's going to be a problem, then.  Because she is.  She will attempt to take this game away from everybody else that could enjoy it in a way  that doesn't affect their lives.  Just because her Christmases are now going to be a little lonelier. 
[02:35:30]  Elbow on the ribs.  I don't like playing a game that people don't have lawsuits against.  That's pretty much the rule of thumb I adhere to.  I like games, when Kingpin came out, it was a huge outcry because it was such a violent  game.  I like the games.  Explain Kingpin real fast.  Kingpin's great.  That one rocks.  You're a guy, and you're just screwing up people in the city.  You start with a lead pipe.  You can beat hookers, steal their money, shoot people, shoot gangbangers, sell drugs. 
[02:36:00]  It was great.  Well, weren't they trying to pull Grand Theft Auto 3, or was that just a rule?  Of course they were trying to pull that.  A little message to Rockstar, do not be pussies.  Nah.  We're all waiting for Grand Theft Auto 4.  It's going to be a while.  Don't back down.  You know, there's a lot of the people that are into trying to ban things like this.  They get more violent and crazy than Grand Theft Auto 3.  Please.  You know, it's funny, they're so worried about computer games and the violence and the bad  things for their kids.  Long before computer games, blacks were being lynched in the South, so enough with blaming 
[02:36:30]  computer games because you're bad parents.  That's what it is.  Sean was playing 12 hours a day.  He wasn't supposed to because he was epileptic.  The game would cause him to fly into epileptic seizures.  Probably the last eight times he had seizures because of his stints playing EverQuest.  Oh, what a zilch.  Big goose egg.  Willie understands her son has problems beyond, had problems beyond EverQuest, and she tried  to help him contact a mental health program.  Mental health?  Let's see what he had problems with. 
[02:37:00]  Diagnosed him with depression, schizoid personality disorder, symptoms of which include a lack  of desire for social relationships, little or no sex drive, and a limited range of emotions  in social settings.  This fed right into EverQuest playing.  It was the perfect escape.  Pete, what's going on?  Not a lot, man.  How's it going?  All right, go ahead.  You were talking about the guys playing 16, 18 hours.  Somebody said 36. 
[02:37:30]  Right.  I had a 55th level magician, and my group, we went up and played in hate for 72 and a  half hours straight.  You're a level what, what, sir?  You're a level what?  55th level magician.  I no longer.  I quit playing EverQuest about six months ago.  Oh, you did.  You're clean and sober.  What happened?  What made you quit?  What got you up the booth, sir?  Was it the feel of a warm female mouth for the first time?  What made you quit? 
[02:38:00]  I walked in one day, and I just decided I was done.  Cold turkey, you did it.  Wow.  People talk about it like drugs when they say they stopped.  They're like, no, man, you know, I had to get out of that.  I had to stop.  Now, of course, I did go from heroin to mescaline, and I went right back in, because I'm playing  Dark Age of Camelot right now.  Oh, yeah, that seems to be the one other people are picking up.  What's the highest level you've ever heard of to get to?  60 is the highest level there is.  60 is the highest.  As of now, they might come out with an expansion that could push the levels up higher for those 
[02:38:30]  people that are 60 now and have nowhere to go.  I'm at 51, but I'm going to take my time for the next nine levels.  Sir, how did you quit level 55 when you could have got to 60 and been like the head EverQuest  person?  Hell no.  There's so many 60s.  It's a funny word.  They might have sent you a little wizard hat.  Anthony, tell them how hard it is to get from 51 to 60.  It's very hard.  It takes a long time.  I'm not sure what.  There's a lot of things that are hard, too.  So what?  It's hard to get hepatitis C.  It doesn't mean I want to do it.  It's hard.  So what? 
[02:39:00]  You know what else is hard?  A black mule.  It doesn't mean I want to sit on it.  I just thought I'd rather get the old mule heart.  Mule.  Goddamn, is that funny.  All right, Pete.  Take care.  Listen to you, Columbus, man.  Norton, you rule.  Thanks, Pete.  Thank you, Columbus.  Is Columbus one of the cities that will be dropping the O&A show?  People are emailing me.  They really think it's an April Fool's joke.  I've gotten three emails from people.  You know, there's nothing we can say.  I know.  I'm telling you right now, two cities are dropping the O&A show very, very soon. 
[02:39:30]  But you'll be surprised when, you know, the April Fool's ends for us in 20 minutes.  And then maybe tomorrow one of these cities is off the air.  And then you'll be like, wow, they weren't lying.  Steve, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  God, dude, I have so much to say.  I'm calling from Cleveland.  I've played EverQuest since the day it came out.  I play with my brother.  I have a 60 cleric, a 60 enchanter, a 60 druid.  So you can tell I spend a lot of my time on there.  How many years ago is this, sir?  How many years have you been playing?  I've been playing since beta. 
[02:40:00]  About three years.  Can you enchant some electric formula?  I can do anything you want, but I'm on in Rooks.  So if you want to play on Rooks, look for big.  You know what?  I've actually hashed around the idea of getting a second computer just so I can make my own teammates.  I do a comp.  I play my enchanter and my player.  Dual account.  So now you can have two people that team up and then help each other out.  Yeah, I do that.  I know people have done that.  Now, another thing, if you look on eBay right now, people sell these characters on eBay. 
[02:40:30]  And I think, like, Sony is against it.  They don't like it.  But people build the character up.  Let's say there's a level 60.  He's got, like, some really good equipment on him.  They sell their accounts for upwards of $1,000.  What do you, like, say this guy is really obviously a good player, which is like being the guy who's bagging the most fat chicks.  What do you do now with the game, bro?  Do you still play it?  I hung up on it.  You know what happens at that point?  You still play because it's a social environment. 
[02:41:00]  Do you go into chat rooms?  Are you ever in a chat room talking with people?  Not really, no.  But I talk in instant messages.  I'm not trying to.  Okay, instant message.  It's the environment is the same because there's a chat window.  So as you're in this environment, instead of just chatting, you're off doing things.  You team up with, like, a few people to slay something that's a little bigger than you would be able to do alone.  And the whole online society.  But here's the difference.  He said it's kind of like the chat room.  No, it's not.  All right, you're chasing around a lion-headed bird man who might throw an arrow at you, 
[02:41:30]  and I'm trying to get some girl to give me a Hummer in a parking lot at Rascals.  That's the difference.  I'm not talking to another.  I'm not talking to a fat pizza shop worker.  Hey, put the gun down, son.  I'll send you some stuff that I have accumulated.  No.  I'm always like, yeah, it's me.  Hey, glad you enjoy the show.  Would you?  You got any pics?  I don't know.  You know something?  I'm looking at the phones, and I see a lot of people that play this game.  Hopefully on my potty mouth.  Hopefully you can keep the potty mouth. 
[02:42:00]  Some good stuff.  400,000 people play this game online.  How many people were Nazis?  Does that mean it's good?  Actually, in fact, the other day, you can group with up to six people,  and the other day I got into a group, and...  And you put on group chat, so you can only speak with the people,  so you can speak with the people in your group, and all of a sudden...  I was actually playing with Nazis because they were all typing in German.  I had no idea.  Because it's worldwide, so you get a group of German people, 
[02:42:30]  you get in there, and you're seeing German text, and...  It's multicultural.  Look out on the bright side.  400,000 people that are not in the streets of the world.  Look, please, and I agree, that's 400,000 tickets.  I'm not going to sell to town hall on April 18th.  Oh, God.  400,000 people you don't have to, you know, compete against to get that yellow discipline.  Exactly.  Excellent way.  A long way to walk for that, but an excellent way to look at that.  Wes, what's up?  Yo, what's up?  Yo. 
[02:43:00]  I think me and my roommates were playing for about one week on and off.  Get a hold of yourself, would you?  Yeah, sorry.  I'm kind of sick.  Wait, wait.  It says your friends, you'd do shifts, and one of you would...  Yeah, one of us would play for about maybe like one and a half or two days.  Then he'd wake one of us up.  He'd go to sleep.  One of us would take over.  Jesus.  Do you know what I would do?  I would play the game and then lose your man and not wake you,  and you'd come back and no game.  And I'd be laughing. 
[02:43:30]  But, I mean, it was just so true because we were in one spot the entire time.  We were waiting for one piece of equipment to drop.  Yeah, see, sometimes you do something.  Opie, you camp a location.  Yeah, right.  This means you go to a location, and one of the computer-generated characters  will appear at some point in the game.  You must slay him to get a piece that he's holding  that you either turn in later for a quest or get right off the bat.  Maybe he's got some good armor that you want to take.  But the trick is some of these computer-generated characters... 
[02:44:00]  It takes like a week to spawn.  ...take a week to spawn in that location.  And people are fighting over the camp.  You have to sit there for a week.  And we didn't get it.  That's the worst part.  And you didn't get it in the end?  No.  It didn't drop anything.  You should get it in the end.  I was going to say...  It seems like none of you guys are getting it.  What?  All right.  Let me go to Matt.  We've got to take a break.  That would be preferable to play in that game.  What are you doing?  I'm getting it in the end.  I can't talk right now.  Matt, what's up?  Yo, what's up, Opie and Anthony?  How's it going?  I play EverQuest like all day, every day. 
[02:44:30]  And that's all I do.  How old are you, son?  What?  How old are you, son?  I'm 14.  I'm almost 15.  There's a trench coat and a tragedy in your future.  You do know that, don't you?  No, there's not, Norton.  I have 51 days played, 18 hours and 42 minutes.  I do...  I'm addicted.  It says you spend all day making beer.  What does that mean?  I, uh...  Oh, he's a brewer.  I'm a brewer.  There you go. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, you brew, so you make the beer.  I'm a dwarf, too.  And then he sells it.  He's a dwarf and little brewer, and he sells the beer.  And what is your pal-y friend one on the Aone Row server?  Because that's what I'm on.  Okay, dude, whatever you got.  I'll send you t-shirts.  Anthony autographs some shirts or something.  I'll get you whatever you need, kid.  Just keep sending it.  That's insane.  Do you want to know my name?  Yeah, go ahead.  I'm a 58 warrior.  My name is Talari.  T-A-L-A-R-I.  I need a pen.  I need a pen. 
[02:45:30]  It's Talari.  T-A-L-A-R-I.  These guys are losing it.  All right, thanks, Matt.  Let me go to Mike, and then we've got to take a break.  Go, Mike.  Hey.  Hey.  What's up, Mike?  I was a player of you guys.  Actually, Anthony had a journal.  Oh, yeah.  Quite a while back.  Laguna?  Yeah, I remember that.  Okay.  Yeah, see?  He was one of the buds that I've played with online.  Really?  Yeah, and I also won Norton tickets in Cleveland, so hopefully on the day you guys come out  there, I'll be able to come up to the studio and irritate you guys. 
[02:46:00]  Hopefully you can tear yourself away from that computer.  Allow me, Norton.  Oh, hey.  All right.  All right.  At the show.  Don't try to get on my good side.  With that, we'll break and we'll do the what do we learn next thing.  The Opie and Anthony F.U. line is there for you when life sucks.  Sucks to be me.  Call anytime.  212-830-3785.  On the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:46:30]  N.W.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  W.N.E.W.  It's time to play What Do We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show today.  Let's get right to it.  Chris, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  All right.  I learned a lot today.  If I make it to 60, I get a magician's hat.  I hope he thinks sperm is going to make it through.  Well, you know, hey, guys, you've got to try, you know? 
[02:47:00]  Well, how about this?  Jay's head was under a nut sack.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  All right.  I think we're done with you.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let's go right to the instant feedback.  Safer that way.  Al Mack.  Today I learned fat, epileptic, depressed pizza shop employees should not play EverQuest.  Oogie Pringles Ghost.  Nice.  Oogie.  Hey, forgot about the Oogmeister.  I learned today the PGM button wasn't down.  And our Earl is a lazy Earl. 
[02:47:30]  Our Earl is a lazy Earl.  Thank you.  Jersey Gary, I learned today a griffin is a large-headed flying creature.  An ant is an alchemist.  He also learned the Pope gave up BJs for Parkinson's.  He also learned Jay Moore pulled the goalie and is hoping for a Dominican that can bat 340 and hit 40 homers.  Paybacks are a bitch.  Dave, as usual, O&A always win in the air.  Yes.  Austin, thanks for the continued support. 
[02:48:00]  We're live Friday from WBCN's studio.  So head over there and party outside.  And, you know, you know the deal.  We have fun up there.  Absolutely.  And Jersey Gary also writes, I learned today Craig got the Z chowder.  Jerry from Edison.  Town Hall is still, still, despite shameless plugging, pathetically not sold out.  It won't.  He also learned the beginning of Moore's Sports has a happy ending.  And if there's corn in the chowder, you know where it came from.  God damn, that's good. 
[02:48:30]  We have some funny bastards listening to this show.  Sheep lover.  I learned the calf is less gay than the thigh.  Rob from VA.  18 cities are scared to death right now, but only two are F'd.  Yeah, going off the air in, it looks like two cities.  And look, April Fools is just about over for Aunt Nye.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Where do you want to go here?  We'll go to Rob.  Rob, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Today I learned Keith is going to get contacted by Psychological Services tomorrow. 
[02:49:00]  Hey, Keith, don't you want to mention your guild?  Opie, turn up, Keith.  Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.  Listen to this one.  Yes, the Disciples of Justice.  Thank you.  Look at Noyden's face.  What does that mean?  That's his guild.  That's a guild that I'm in.  I'm not in a guild, Opie.  I'm sort of like a freelance guy.  I hook up with the Cats and Hats guy.  They help me out, but they're all level 60, my friend. 
[02:49:30]  That's kind of gay.  They're badass.  Disciples of Justice.  Disciples of Justice?  At least it's a little tougher.  They all stink.  Cats and Hats would probably kick your ass, though.  They're all 60s.  Good point.  They're like Uber characters.  Uber.  Uber.  Garglers of Seeds.  That should be the name.  Is this true?  Well, I meet from Jersey.  Hey, guys, FYI.  KTU just did your $100,000 prank today.  Yes.  As their April Fool's prank.  Really?  Like they said, they're going to give away $100,000, and they get a lucky winner, and it 
[02:50:00]  turns out to be the candy bar.  Yeah.  What kind of...  Oh, well.  Hey, we did it.  What kind of crap?  Awesome.  Dave, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  I learned that Norton would give Earl Teresa Jay Moore to do a skit with Ozzy.  That's true.  Oh, you know what?  Thank you very much, gentlemen.  I didn't even mean to go to you.  I meant to go to Awesome Garrett.  Sorry, Dave.  Awesome Garrett.  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey, Awesome Garrett.  You're not Awesome Garrett, though.  No, he's...  Well, I'm awesome nonetheless.  He adopted the name Awesome Garrett when he calls our show. 
[02:50:30]  Go ahead, Awesome Garrett.  Well, I learned a couple of things.  You can't dump out of sperm.  Right.  And there are 400,000 people that are never going to have sex.  Very good.  I don't know.  Thank you, Awesome Garrett.  Our Garrett is an Awesome Garrett.  Matt writes, I learned people don't kill people.  Lion-headed birds kill people.  And you can pay for admission to see Jim Norton and then get it back in the parking lot. 
[02:51:00]  That's good.  Jimmy, what's going on?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  I learned that when you guys come to Boston Friday, it's going to kick ass.  Yeah, we're going to have fun.  Thank you, man.  I learned that Norton sucks because he hates all video gamers.  Mm-hmm.  I also learned that you can't dump out on sperm.  Right.  And I learned that 14-year-old Gary and that other kid that just called both suck.  All right.  Dude, I don't hate all video gamers.  It's not true.  All right.  Jimmy, anything else?  I think you're defending yourself.  Hey, Norton. 
[02:51:30]  Not going to work, sir.  I don't hate video gamers.  I just don't like the video games.  I think most video gamers should somehow be killed in a helicopter crash.  I'm not saying I hate all of them.  A virtual crash where you kind of got to bring it in yourself?  Charlie Company.  Charlie Company.  When you call your friend, did you see that?  He goes, yeah.  And a rub and a tug.  All right, Ben.  All right.  All right.  Oh, look at Ben.  He's freaking out.  Ben's freaking out.  I see a paper with 652 written on it, and it's 45 seconds past now, Opie.  Our Garrett is an awesome Garrett, and his keister fits snugly around my finger. 
[02:52:00]  There may be one city that we're saying goodbye to today.  Really?  Today?  It might be as soon as today.  So it's been fun.  But, yeah, if they don't dump out of this, we will be back.  Yeah.  Because O&A always win right in the end.  As soon as we have details, we'll pass along to everyone else.  But this could be it for one city.  Don't know.  Yeah.  We'll find out soon. 
[02:52:30]  Thank you. </pre>
