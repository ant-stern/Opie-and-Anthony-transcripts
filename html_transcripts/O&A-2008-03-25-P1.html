<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with Adam Ferrara as a guest, recounting humorous stories of his early life struggles, including periods of poverty, failed sales jobs (optics and water filters), and irresponsible spending.  The hosts shared their own anecdotes, focusing on their past experiences with Ferrara, recalling Nerf gun battles and Opie's surprisingly modest former home.  The conversation then shifted to Anthony's recent experience babysitting his nieces and nephews for three weeks, sparking a tirade about the difficulties and annoyances of parenthood, peppered with hyperbolic and offensive language.  A caller offered a contrasting perspective on the joys of parenthood, further fueling the hosts’ exaggerated and vulgar complaints.

The discussion continued with further anecdotes about the exhaustion of parenthood, focusing on the hosts' fathers and humorous stories about Adam Carolla's father and his car repair attempts.  This segued into a rant about perceived changes in women after childbirth, using exaggerated and offensive descriptions.  Mike Rowe, host of *Dirty Jobs* and *Shark Week*, then joined the show as a guest.  He detailed his experiences filming *Shark Week*, describing shark bites and the dangers of filming with sharks in a protective suit.  He also recounted the extreme dangers faced by crab fishermen on *Deadliest Catch*, including graphic descriptions of injuries and deaths.

The show then veered into a news story about Yoko Ono's chauffeur being arrested for blackmailing her with compromising photos and tapes, leading to humorous, highly descriptive, and sexually suggestive speculation about Ono's life.  This was followed by a Rolling Stones' *Rock and Roll Circus* audio clip featuring Yoko Ono's singing, which the hosts described as unpleasant.  A discussion about a chimpanzee attack, involving graphic descriptions of injuries inflicted on a couple, followed.  The hosts and callers expressed strong opinions about this event and the nature of chimpanzees.

The next segment began with a discussion about gorillas and aggressive chimpanzee behavior, centering around St. James Davis, who was severely injured by chimpanzees and wanted his pet chimpanzee, Mo, returned. The hosts and callers expressed disbelief and used highly offensive language to discuss the situation.  A caller, Eddie, shared his experiences owning a chimpanzee, further highlighting the animal's aggressive tendencies.  The segment concluded with a “dope of the day” segment featuring Roger from Kentucky criticizing XM radio censorship, followed by a game where listeners guessed which concert Anthony wanted to attend (No Doubt).  This led to relentless homophobic slurs and offensive teasing of Anthony from Opie, Ben, and the callers, which continued until the segment's end.

[00:03:00]  WXRK New York, it's the O.P. 
[00:03:30]  Some people don't like you to mention certain things. 
[00:04:00]  Some people don't want you to say this.  Some people don't want you to say that.  Some people think if you mention some things, they might happen.  Some people are really f***ing stupid.  You're listening to the worst, you're listening to the worst, you're listening to the worst, not the best, the absolute worst.  And you're listening to the worst of O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  It's absolutely awful.  Hey, look who's in studio. 
[00:04:30]  My pal.  My pal.  My pal.  My pal.  My pal too.  My pal.  I've known Adam before he was even famous.  Oh.  But because of you, he's now my pal as well.  Everyone's pal.  Adam Ferrari, everybody.  Please.  I knew Adam.  I was working construction.  Sure.  And Adam was trying to figure out what he wanted to do after college.  And that spanned the globe. 
[00:05:00]  That was it.  Oh, boy.  Until you found comedy.  Thank God you found comedy.  Yeah.  Because you were on the road to ruin, my friend.  He came over my house once.  And I was just a dirtbag.  Two.  And I'm going to say two because so were you.  I know.  I was a dirtbag.  I couldn't pay my rent.  I'm living in an apartment we used to call Pee Wee's Playhouse.  It was just people would walk in.  We'd be watching TV, a coffee table covered with beer cans.  We'd stack them up like a pyramid and drink.  And the door would fly open. 
[00:05:30]  And one of our friends would come rolling in and shooting those plastic dart guns at us,  which we all had on us at all times because you might get assaulted like this.  And a firefight with these dart guns would break out.  And then, you know, when you ran out of darts, the war was over.  And we'd sit down and watch TV and drink beer.  And that was pretty much what our lives were all about.  But he hooked up with a gig where he's selling.  What are you doing this week, Adam?  Ed, I'm selling optics.  Like, what the? 
[00:06:00]  Optics?  Optics.  You need binoculars?  What do you need?  Yeah, I got everything.  So I'm like, well, that sounds good.  How's it going for you?  Great.  Great.  Next week, Adam, how's the optics?  The optics?  What are you waiting?  Out of your mind?  Now, water filters.  Water purifiers.  Have you looked at the water you're drinking?  The water you're drinking is filthy.  I go, okay, so what does this entail?  All you got to do is this. 
[00:06:30]  And he'd make this thing like he's clutching something between his thumb and forefinger  and turning it a quarter turn clockwise.  He goes, all you got to do is this.  And I'd be like, what does that mean?  What happened?  It's as easy as it's that easy.  Hook up a filter.  You give me 1995, you will have pure water.  Pure water.  He's selling water filters.  He was like a fuller brush, man.  I did everything.  Everything this guy did.  And then there's a comedy contest. 
[00:07:00]  It's a dive.  Norton, we're making a movie.  We don't know how to make no movie, Ralph.  How hard could it be?  That's what he was.  The Ralph Cramden of our crew.  And then there was a comedy competition that was out on Long Island.  Some dump in Comac.  Yeah.  He goes over there and he did very well.  Yeah, I won that.  You won that one.  And they sent him out.  Pay more on the water filters.  Yeah.  And no more scams.  No more optics or water filters.  No more scams.  And no more seeing Adam. 
[00:07:30]  It's like, Adam, where are you?  I'm going out to L.A.  I'm doing this.  Hollywood.  And it really went quickly after that.  Like, you started getting a lot of gigs.  You picked up management.  And then Adam was the guy that, like, we're sitting around still, you know, waiting for a friend to come to the door with the dart gun, drinking the beer, going, how the hell did Adam pull that off?  We use just as much of a dirt bag as we are.  And he's out there, you know, on the road.  I see him on TV.  I'm seeing him doing things.  Like, what the hell happened? 
[00:08:00]  You bested.  I mean, you know, it's funny.  I'm listening to that story and the odds of one guy getting out of that.  Oh, that whole thing of, yeah, the whole life.  That scenario from cops.  That's exactly what it was.  And two of you got out.  Just living paycheck to paycheck.  Just barely.  Hanging on.  You know, and most of it went to beer and toys.  We love.  We would be.  This is how irresponsible we were.  We'd get paid like a pittance for the crap jobs that we had to do.  On Thursdays.  Yeah.  We'd get drunk on Thursdays.  And we'd run out, grab a bunch of beer. 
[00:08:30]  And then instead of doing things like electric bills and things, rent, stuff like that, we would run to Toys R Us and buy toys.  Nothing.  There was a day we'd just wander around Toys R Us and we'd come home with a slot car set.  Yeah.  And set it up and get drunk and play with slot cars while the landlord was banging on the door.  Please tell everyone how old you are, by the way.  Because if you're like 22, 23, most people are like, yeah, of course.  Probably late.  I was in my late 20s, early 30s. 
[00:09:00]  I was mid-20s.  You were mid-20s.  And I had friends and my brother.  22, you can play with race cars?  I'm thinking toys.  Yes.  That's still happening right out of college.  We used to go to Toys R Us.  You're still not a grown-up?  And then we would come back individually and the guys that worked it, I don't have a bigger dart gun.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  We'd try to buy better guns to shoot the other guy.  Better guns because you needed a better arsenal.  Jim Laird bought a shotgun version of the dart gun and sawed it off.  Like, sawed-off shot. 
[00:09:30]  He'd come rolling in the door.  It was ridiculous.  It was just a life on the road to ruin.  It was like Peter Sellers when Cato would attack him when he came home.  Yeah, yeah.  Just surprise me.  Any minute someone could jump out of a laundry room and shoot you.  That's awesome.  And I was $20,000 in credit card debt because for some reason they gave me a credit card.  They gave me one credit card with a $4,000 limit on it.  And once I started chalking that up, they sent me another one and another one. 
[00:10:00]  And they sent me $20,000 worth of credit cards and I used every bit of it.  And I'm talking buying, like, CD players, camcorders, helicopters, just buying crap.  I remember I was making $300 a week.  They gave me a credit card limit of, like, $5,000.  Yeah, how are you going to ever pay that off?  It's like they're trying to end your life.  They just want you to get you on that wheel.  They are.  And I said to myself, I'm like, I can never pay this off.  Like, I'm paying the minimum, I think, on each card was $60 or $80 or something like that a month. 
[00:10:30]  And I didn't have anything.  At some point I was out of work.  I worked as a pool installer for a while where, you know, I'm not even, like, in the ground pool where it takes some skill above.  I was installing above the ground pool in pools in just white trash Long Island yards.  And it was awful, making no money, couldn't pay my credit card bills or anything, just a constant mess. 
[00:11:00]  And then radio came along and it was like, you know, hooked up with Opie.  Excuse me, Opie came along.  That's it.  That's right.  Not radio.  Let me tell you something, my friend.  Other radio guys could have had you, but they were too stupid.  That's right.  Because you were doing a lot of radio shows, but those asses with their big egos couldn't see the future.  All right, Savior.  I saw the future.  Let me bring something up, Savior.  No, I'm not.  I'm just saying that I saw the future, that there's other guys out there that were dummies that didn't see it. 
[00:11:30]  I know. There's a little Savior in there.  They are.  There is a little Savior in there, of course.  But I want to bring up something about the Savior at this point.  But when I first started going to BAB, where Opie worked, and doing the show, I assumed, for some reason, that anyone that was on the radio was rich.  I just assumed that.  If you were on the radio, you were rich.  So Opie, a big day for me, invited me over to the house to watch.  Oh, this story.  This story.  It was to watch.  What was that movie that the guy died filming?  Brandon Lee? 
[00:12:00]  Brandon Lee, yeah.  The Crow.  The Crow.  I invited you over to see Crow?  See The Crow on video?  Yeah.  I was very excited.  It's Opie from BAB inviting me over to his place.  And I'm like, he put a roofie in your dress?  Yeah.  It sounded creepy.  He walked in.  It sounds creepy to me.  I don't remember this.  Actually, you just invited me over to talk about the show.  Yeah, okay.  There was somebody else there and watching The Crow or something like that.  So, you know, just talking about, like, how, you know, the future of the show and stuff.  Back rubs.  Pretty cool.  Yeah, back rubs too, man.  You put on these handcuffs. 
[00:12:30]  I'm going to drill a hole in your head and pour Drano in it.  Show your magic trick.  So I assume, because he lived in Northport, which is a pretty nice.  Nice town of Long Island.  Town of Long Island, North Shore, right on the water.  It's one of those sleepy towns.  Sleepy towns.  Sleepy towns.  Everyone's very sleepy.  But I'm assuming, you know, like, gated, this big mansion I'm going to be pulling up to.  Announcing Mr. Cumia.  Walk this way.  If I could walk that way.  I had a name in Long Island Radio. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  You got to tell the people.  So I had a little name for myself doing my own little thing.  Nothing like what we're doing today, obviously.  But as far as Long Island Radio goes, I was doing all right.  You were like the guy that has his own mattress commercial.  Yeah.  There you go.  You knew the guy.  Crazy Opie.  You knew the guy.  Opie's nighttime attitude.  The people knew the show, knew the guy, knew the name.  A lot of attitude with that show.  You were famous if you squint.  A lot of attitude.  And so I figured, wow, this is the coolest thing. 
[00:13:30]  I'm actually going to hang out.  So maybe I could get something going and get into radio.  Because it's what I wanted to do.  And I didn't want to do construction anymore.  So Opie gives me the address.  And I'm driving around in my Apollo air conditioning work van because I didn't own a car.  Because I couldn't afford insurance or car or anything like that.  So I would take my work van, which was only supposed to be used for work.  Did they ever notice I had a trailer hitch on the back to tow my jet ski that I bought with a credit card?  You're driving 3,000 miles a week.  Exactly.  They'd be like, mileage. 
[00:14:00]  They would want mileage.  And I'm like, oh, I'll give it to you in a minute.  I don't think in five years I ever gave them one mileage.  And I would lie about it.  So it would keep building up.  I'm like, oh, my God.  I'm telling them I have like 63,000 miles on this.  And there's like 84,000 miles.  If they ever check, I'm so fired.  I had a low-profile trailer hitch on there because I used to tow my jet ski.  And I'd get done with work.  If I was finished with the job at noon, you're supposed to call in and get another job to go to.  But I'd be like, I'm going to be here all day.  And I'd go down to Northport and back their work van into salt water with my trailer. 
[00:14:30]  Take my jet ski off.  There I am in Northport, Harvard, just buzzing around with my work van in the parking lot with a big trailer on it.  That's classic working man stiff debt, 20 grand credit card debt.  But you still have a jet ski.  I bought the jet ski with the credit card, with one of the $8,000 credit cards.  And he's on the jet ski in his uniform with the hat.  Hey, I'm going on a service call at Nashroken. 
[00:15:00]  What do you want from me?  Leave me alone.  Anthony, why is there seaweed in the truck?  And, yeah, the truck started rotting away.  It was rusting on the back.  And they're like, what the hell is going on?  I don't know what's happening.  A trailer hitch.  That's the best part.  I don't know.  How do you get away with that?  But, yeah, it was one of those situations where, you know, just had to get out of it.  And I went over the house to have this meeting.  And I'm expecting this big house.  I pull up to a crap hole house. 
[00:15:30]  And Opie has half of it.  I had the top half.  The top half of the crappiest house.  And then me.  This was after 10 years in the biz.  Yeah, 10 years in radio.  In the biz.  And I assumed everybody in radio was rich.  So even then, I'm thinking, this has to be his summer place.  This has to be like, he's just here in Northport.  He got this place as a summer place.  And he has to have this winter place. 
[00:16:00]  But, no.  This is the vacation spot upstairs at Uncle Phil's?  Exactly.  But it was in Northport.  This was it.  So I figured.  No AC.  That was it.  No AC.  Just a hot.  There's cats roaming around.  Just a hot second floor apartment.  It was just, it was off with a fan blowing somewhere, you know.  Half the stuff I got off the sidewalk.  That was the first.  That someone was thrown away.  Engine blocking a yard.  Yeah.  That was the first inkling I got that maybe radio isn't just all glory and, you know, fortune and glory. 
[00:16:30]  But now we're millionaires so we can just laugh.  The old days.  Did I tell you I bought that house and burnt it down just for the fun of it?  By the way, as we laugh, we're just throwing money in the air today.  Yes, we're the family still in it.  I paid them off.  That's funny, though.  You must get this, Adam.  Like, the first time you ever did, like, a premium blend and then you did a college gig and people had actually seen you on TV and they're like, I can't believe you're here. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Thinking that you made, like, a zillion dollars.  Now you made it.  I was like my first, you know, remember the MTV, the Half Hour Comedy Hour and Caroline's all that stuff on A&E?  So I do all that.  I get a gig in Atlantic City and I invite these guys down.  Yeah.  To come to us.  Oh, here's another story.  Same thing.  And you think Adam's big time comic come down.  I was Atlantic City.  He goes, I'm playing the trop.  He's got to be making 10 grand a show in the trop.  This guy's Mr. Vegas over here next.  Now he's in Atlantic City. 
[00:17:30]  He's going to be playing the trop.  He's inviting his buddies down.  This was Entourage before the Entourage show.  I'm going down.  But without all of us, me, Joe Curry, my brother, Adam, we're going to.  I'm going to light up the town.  It's A.C.  My buddy's playing the trop.  Come on down.  Yeah.  What was it?  Whores for everyone.  Oh, God.  There was a Murphy bed.  It wasn't the big room at the trop.  It was the comedy club.  It was the comedy club at the trop.  It's in the trop.  You don't stay in the trop.  That's not the Angel Salazar room, is it?  Yeah.  That was before Angel.  I'm thinking he's playing the big room at the trop. 
[00:18:00]  Nah.  No.  He's playing this.  And he's not even allowed to stay at the trop.  That was the condos?  You know the condos?  He's at the condos.  So we all have to sneak in this room to where we're staying overnight.  With the bed that comes out of the wall?  One bed came out of the wall.  Oh, I didn't get the luxury of that.  I was on the floor.  Spring break all over again.  Girl, you and her got the bed.  Oh, the wife was with me.  Well, I couldn't sleep in it because I wasn't heavy enough to keep it down.  Yeah.  So, like, because I had a...  Buzz kill! 
[00:18:30]  And you guys got the bed.  But I fed you.  I snuck you into the employee bed.  Oh, yeah.  That was another thing.  I'm thinking, you know, he's going to be a great room service at the trop, or we're  going to go to one of these restaurants or something.  He hands out expired meal vouchers to all of us.  Here you go.  Here you go.  Here's your vouchers.  They're expired, Adam.  I know.  Look.  Here's the plan.  And now there's a plan.  Stay close to me.  Don't look the people in the eyes that are serving you the food or at the register.  Just walk up. 
[00:19:00]  He goes...  I wish I could say it here, but he goes, lead with your junk.  You know, just lead with, like, like you belong there.  He goes, just look like you belong there.  Hand her the voucher and walk away.  You thought it was going to be like Goodfellas.  I thought I was going to have to shoot McCluskey in the throat and walk out and throw the gun  down.  It was one of the most eye-opening, uncomfortable, oh, my God, my friend is still a piece of  garbage moments.  And now he has to dance for his money.  Yeah. 
[00:19:30]  All right.  Listen, we got a break.  We got to take a break.  Adam Farrar in studio.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  It's the O.B.  and Anthony show.  92.3 K-Rock.  92.3 K-Rock.  It's the O.B.  and Anthony show.  Hey, this is Brian Regan, and you are listening to the worst of O.B.  and Anthony.  Borderline psycho from Michigan, it looks like.  I'm sick, too, O.B., but I went to work anyway.  I'm hoping to take down this office like a Legionnaires convention. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, thanks.  One of those guys that come into work sick.  Get everyone sick.  They think they're very important.  Well, I know I'm going to get sick.  No, no, no.  No, not from you.  Oh, I know I'm over as far as getting other people sick.  Not from you.  The timing was perfect.  It was like right at the end of Friday's show.  That's why I think we all just got really silly on Friday.  Yeah.  I was out of my mind with a fever.  I was starting to hallucinate. 
[00:20:30]  I'll be sick in no time because I was playing video games.  And in my office, because I've sequestered myself in the office for video games because  I have, you know, kids over the house.  That had to end weeks ago.  No, dude.  Tuesday.  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  What's the first thing you're going to do when they leave?  You've had kids in your house for three weeks.  Cleaning crew comes in.  Are you going to read?  Goes over everything.  Are they scuffed anything?  Paint.  Yes, I've noticed some scuffing.  Of course.  Brand new place. 
[00:21:00]  Little children with the scuffing.  I saw the littlest one.  Vincent, pick up a toy and throw it right at my office doors, which are glass.  Oh, thank goodness it didn't break.  But I'm playing video games.  And one of the rules, there's rules.  One of the rules, kids not allowed to come in to Anthony's office area.  So I shut the doors, which then makes it so the air conditioner really can't get in there, 
[00:21:30]  the air conditioning, because you can't, like, suck the air out.  So it kind of gets in the windows.  Don't have curtains on them yet, so the sun is baking it.  So I sit there in a sweltering hot box like I'm in lockdown, like I'm in the hole.  And I got to sit there and play my video games there.  And so the kids came back from somewhere, you know, they were out somewhere, come walking  in, and Anthony, the oldest one, is standing there watching me play the Godfather game,  which is kind of funny because they're just cursing up a storm in the game and I'm blowing 
[00:22:00]  people's heads off and everything.  It's kind of funny for a kid to watch that.  And then he goes, I go, do you need a tissue?  Like, panicking that I didn't even look at him.  Like, I'm like, do you need a tissue?  Because I didn't want to see it.  And he goes, no, that was a cough.  Like, oh, okay, good.  So you just, like, coughed all over me.  When did the kids realize during their visit that you didn't want to hang out with them?  Two days in. 
[00:22:30]  First day was probably cool because it was all fun and new.  Everyone comes in and is like, oh, hey, it's been a while, blah, blah, blah.  By day two, did they realize you had no desire to hang out with them?  It's a conflicting schedule thing.  It's not a don't want to hang out with them.  I have nothing to say to kids.  I don't know how to talk to them.  What do you say?  They come up and show you something.  Uncle Anthony, look at them.  Oh, neat.  Get out of here.  I don't know what to say to kids.  Did you spend any quality time with the kids? 
[00:23:00]  Quality time?  Like, I was out in South Hole visiting my brother and his kids, and I jumped on a trampoline  for, like, a half hour with the kids.  Ew.  How old are the kids?  Eight, almost seven, tree.  That's even getting there.  Look, I'll be a lot better when the kids are older.  I don't, I can't deal with kids that are under, like, I don't know, ten.  When you could start carrying on a real conversation with them about something that's real, it's not 
[00:23:30]  always just, don't do that.  Put that down.  Stop that.  Leave that alone.  Get over here.  Get off him.  Don't touch that.  Touch this.  Take that.  Put that away.  That's all I've heard for two weeks straight is orders being barked out.  You're constantly giving them orders.  Who wants these things?  Who has children to want to have kids?  You're crazy. 
[00:24:00]  As house guests, it's one thing, because there's a light at the end of the tunnel.  When you are a parent, what were you thinking?  It's nothing but, stop it.  Stop it.  Stop hitting him.  Put that down.  Put that down.  Pick this up.  Use this.  What are you doing?  So did you or did you not spend quality time with the kids?  Not a second.  Not one moment you had?  Not real.  I must say, before Anthony hacked on me with the cough, the video game thing was cool,  because he was kind of, like, talking about how his dad had played it and stuff,  and it's a fun game, which I'm still playing, and he's just looking at me, like, playing the game. 
[00:24:30]  So that was cool.  Did you read a little story to one of the fellas?  Story?  Stop it.  Who's got time to read?  What?  No.  I don't even touch him, really.  I kind of, I picked little Vincent up.  He doesn't even touch him.  I picked him up, turned him around 180 degrees, placed him back down, and said, go,  to have him run away from some equipment.  And then ran into your office and disinfected your entire body.  And the last time.  With the hidden cleaning supplies that you have in there. 
[00:25:00]  Yes, the Purell bath.  Wait, is that office the place where the floor has been badly scratched by pushing the ottoman?  No, that was in the reading room.  But the little nubs are on the bottom of the ottoman now, and it wasn't as bad as I had heard.  I just heard it and didn't even want to look.  But I do have to go and have somebody come and clean all the windows, because for some reason, windows fascinate children.  They take sticky hands and put it on them.  They've got to lick them.  They've got to put snot on them. 
[00:25:30]  They've got to do it.  Because that's what kids do.  I'm not saying that these children are any different than anybody else's children.  They're just children.  You're saying you hate these awful kids as much as you do all kids.  Right.  Yeah, that's how I hear it, too.  No, because...  Did you ever want kids?  Did I ever want kids?  No.  I've got to tell you.  Ever since you can remember, you never wanted to be a father.  Ever since I can remember, never wanted to be a father, never wanted kids.  Did you have in your neighborhood that one couple that never had kids, and you saw how sad they were? 
[00:26:00]  Sad?  They were never there.  They were out having fun.  Not putting 80,000 pounds of equipment in the back of an SUV so they could go away for two hours.  Holy Jesus.  Get the pack and play.  Get this thing.  Get 20,000 car seats to throw in the...  Strap the kids in.  You've got to go two miles down the street.  I swear, it takes 45 minutes to pack up, at least, sometimes an hour, to pack up kids.  I'm one of seven, and my neighbors, they never had kids, right?  Yeah.  And they started out as a young couple, and they looked like they were having a lot of fun. 
[00:26:30]  You would see their friends coming over.  They'd have yard parties and all that.  Granted, they were enjoying themselves while it was like just a zoo at my house with seven kids, okay?  And all the other kids that my parents decided to adopt over the years, and the people that were living in the freaking attic that we discovered from time to time.  I mean, it was insane.  All of a sudden, there's Karen.  Who's Karen?  Well, she's your sister.  How could she be my sister? 
[00:27:00]  She's 17 years old.  Someone please explain this to me.  Where has she been for 17 years?  In the attic.  And then next thing you know, Karen leaves because she can't take the crap that's going on in my house.  All of a sudden, Karen's not your sister anymore.  Okay, that was fun for a couple of years.  That's just weird.  Of course.  This isn't run-of-the-mill stuff.  Daddy, is there a ghost in the attic?  I don't know.  I'll check.  And we find someone that was living there for months.  Someone's boyfriend that got kicked out of their house.  The stories go on and on in my house. 
[00:27:30]  But anyway, the point I'm making, so the years go by.  Yep.  Like, I grew up in Centerport.  You know, we moved in when I was four or five.  And I moved out pretty much at 18 and never really looked back.  But, you know, my mom still has the house.  And only recently, I don't know, maybe like five years ago, this couple without the kids finally moved to Florida.  And as the years went by, it wasn't as happy as what I'm getting at.  No.  And then we would see them staring out their window at our house in the driveway and all the kids having fun. 
[00:28:00]  And you could see that they really missed out on something.  Let me tell you about missing out.  Like, when they were young, it didn't matter.  But when they got older, they felt like they were missing something.  Well, you know something?  20, 25 years later, now they're an old couple looking at our driveway.  Exactly.  Keywords, they're an old couple.  Have fun when you're young.  Why would you bury yourself to have to take care of kids, to lose any spontaneity whatsoever left in your relationship? 
[00:28:30]  Because you've got to plan every goddamn move you make because of these little kids.  So that later in life, what you're saying is they can watch you rot.  That's pretty much it.  You're sacrificing the fun, vibrant, vibrant, thank you, almost vital years of your life so that when you're older, you could sit there and be a burden.  What if your mommy and daddy thought the same thing?  You wouldn't be here.  Then I wouldn't be here. 
[00:29:00]  But the Opie and Jimmy show, no one would know about me.  Is your mommy happy that she had three kids?  Of course she is.  They weren't planned.  I'll tell you that.  All three weren't planned?  All three.  All three.  My brother was...  She was pregnant with my brother Joe before they were even married.  My brother's birthday's in July.  Their anniversary was something like in September.  So it was one of those weird things.  Whoopsie.  And then it was just, you know...  Mom's a good egg.  It's what you did.  Yeah.  And then they had me, and then Dawn, and that was it.  Your mom's a goer.  After Dawn.  Nice. 
[00:29:30]  Oh.  Really hot.  Stop.  It's hot stuff, right?  It's my mother.  Hey, hey, guys.  Oh, what?  Right here.  Yeah.  Sitting here.  That's very sexy.  What's wrong with that?  Right.  I'm not...  Salting?  Yes, it is.  Why?  She's hot to this day, Anthony, and you should acknowledge that.  You have a hot mom.  We like her.  We really do.  I'm glad she likes you boys.  Jesus.  Sal's in the way. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, he kind of is.  Sal is a wonderful man.  Don't say he's in the way.  Yeah, you don't want to say that to Sal.  You're looking to put a hit out on Sal?  He knows all about being in the way.  Trust me.  I'll give you the Paulie look.  Maybe you can shoot him.  What do you want me to shoot him?  It's not a bad idea.  I knew Sal was the real deal when he actually called our show at NEW and threatened our lives.  This is Sal's stepfather, and he actually threatened our lives.  Yeah. 
[00:30:30]  This is no joke.  It wasn't a bit.  It wasn't a bit.  No.  We got very, very scared at that moment.  Look, I'm glad my mother had me as a kid.  That's fine and everything.  She wanted to be a mother, whether she wanted to or not.  She was a good mommy.  She raised us great and everything like that.  I'm just saying it's not for me.  And if someday I'm old and I'm there looking at young couples and their kids and thinking of regrets of days gone by, then so be it.  But right now, I could not imagine having to run around, speak in baby talk, and do nothing but blurt out orders on what you should or shouldn't be doing or touching or eating or this or that or the other thing. 
[00:31:00]  That was actually Ant's idea of being affectionate when he goes, I'm glad my mommy had me.  That was his idea of being like sweet.  I love my mommy.  I give her big hugs and kisses.  Ant has a problem.  Why?  Showing your soft side.  To anybody else.  Say something nice to your mom right now. 
[00:31:30]  She's listening.  Mommy, I love you.  See?  You can hear it in his voice.  He's very uncomfortable.  No.  Yes, you are.  Family is one thing.  I'm very nice with my family.  Anyone else can go F.  I care not about anybody.  Here's a test.  Say something nice to my girlfriend.  My allied forces.  The allied forces kind of got in the way.  This is the ONA virus spreading across America.  The worst.  Of Mookie and Anthony.  I know.  Hey, Nick, what's going on? 
[00:32:00]  Hey, I'm just calling about the smoking deal here.  There you go.  Well, a lot of smokers need the regulation because they're very irresponsible as far as  throwing butts everywhere, especially at the beach.  They think it's one big ashtray.  If the butts at the beach were the biggest problem, how about the medical ones?  People are effing slob.  I was in Miami.  I went into the water, and I was like, I was disgusted.  There are Pringles cylinders floating around.  People are like that.  And chip bags and bags from stores and flip-flops and all kinds of crap. 
[00:32:30]  Dead witnesses.  That people, like, I'm guilty every so often.  You know, I'll flick something out the window.  But never, I usually think, what's going to end up with it?  It's usually biodegradable.  It's impossible.  It's something.  You're not going to, like, I wouldn't throw a Pringles can in the ocean off of Miami.  Well, that's why we have littering laws, too, because most people are irresponsible.  Dude, you're right about that. 
[00:33:00]  I agree with you.  A lot of smokers are pigs with their butts.  But how about you ban that?  You're right, ban it.  And also ban baby changing so I don't have to smell that disgusting loaded diaper in a public place.  That's right.  You're right.  Goddamn parents that bring their babies to the beach.  They change that goddamn diaper.  He's a baby.  What do you want him to do?  Bury it.  I don't know.  Keep him home until he's 11.  Running around on the beach with that monkey diaper on.  Yeah, just loaded.  It's loaded up.  It's cute.  Oh, adorable.  It's cute.  Their little fat legs fumbling clumsily in the sand. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, look at he fell.  Where's that shark that went without a meal when you need him?  Just swallow him whole, crappy diaper and all.  These guys hate kids, huh?  No kids.  Bit of tenderizing down he goes.  I don't hate kids.  It's the parents I hate.  Kids have no choice.  They're stupid, overimposing parents.  Parents are the problem.  What do you hate about kids?  Nothing.  Kids are okay.  I actually have a nephew I love very much.  Kids are cute.  You know something?  Kids are great when they're other peoples.  Right, exactly.  When they're other peoples that can control them. 
[00:34:00]  You shake the shiny object in front of their face.  They make that big, toothless, goofy smile.  And you laugh.  And it's fun.  And you leave.  The last thing I want to do is have to deal.  You know something?  I went out to Colorado.  Remember, buddy?  Was you in a softball game a couple of years ago?  You'd make a good parent, though.  No, I wouldn't.  I'd be a horrible parent.  He's a dad now.  Remember when he's playing ball and stuff, drinking with the guys and everything?  You should see him now.  Everywhere they go, he's a pack mule.  He's a pack mule.  You've got to take the baby crib thing with you. 
[00:34:30]  And there's the bag with the baby stuff and the baby seats that you've got to fasten into the car that's baby friendly.  And then when you get there, you've got to unload the baby stuff.  Now you open it up.  And while you're doing that, you hear this.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Other people on the plane can't sleep here.  Ah!  But that only lasts a few years.  No.  Your entire life.  And there's benefits to having a family, Anthony. 
[00:35:00]  You know something?  Or a tax break?  God bless you if you choose that route in some future juncture.  Christmas is that much better.  Christmas.  That's one thing I hear, too.  You know something?  Christmas meant nothing to me for so many years because I had grown older.  I kind of forgot what it was like to be a child.  But now I'm living Christmas through my child's eyes.  Ah!  Ah!  Play with the ball, Jimmy.  Ah!  You know how you live Christmas?  Christmas, you treat yourself to a nice, big-bottomed Spanish hooker on Christmas.  Then you remember how great Christmas was. 
[00:35:30]  I don't mind kids.  It's the parents trying to...  Feliz Navidad, Jimmy.  Hold on, hold on.  I've got to get back to Anthony for one second.  Yeah.  But is Buddy happy being the pack mule now?  Absolutely.  All right.  So there you go.  He's very happy.  You just can't understand it because it's not your kid.  It's two very beautiful, well-behaved children.  So he's happy.  Yeah.  So what's the problem?  There is no problem.  It's just a different stage in his life.  Oh, here's what it is.  I've got it.  Okay.  Having a baby seems to be like when you fell asleep next to the bean pod in Invasion of 
[00:36:00]  the Body Snatchers.  When, before it happens, you're fighting it tooth and nail.  You hate it.  You look at the people that have changed and go, oh my God, look at him.  He's pointing out everybody.  What is he doing?  I don't want to live this life of post-bean pod and you fight it tooth and nail and the  bean pod people look evil and horrible and nasty and it's a terrible way to go through  life.  There's, there's no, uh, you're, you're lacking some of the things that you would have had, 
[00:36:30]  uh, prior to the bean pods.  Pre-pod.  Then you go to sleep next to the pod.  You wake up and all of a sudden you're one of them.  Everything's fine.  You're not sad.  You don't miss what you had because you really, you're in another phase of, of your, your life.  Yeah.  I don't want to fall asleep next to the bean pod ever.  I like pre-bean pod.  You're looking at post-bean pod and you're kind of digging it.  I'm digging it.  I never look post-bean pod and dig. 
[00:37:00]  Why?  Because it's frightening.  It's, it's, it's, it's a whole different way of life.  I have seen everyone that has had kids changes absolute and complete.  There is a whole change of lifestyle.  There is no more spontaneity in your life.  Period.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  How?  It doesn't have to be that way.  No, it is.  I cannot pick up and go, give me two tickets to goddamn Bahamas.  We're going this weekend. 
[00:37:30]  You get four.  You can't take infants.  No, you can't take infants.  It's a change.  Yeah, but then you're not going down there and getting your mixed banana daiquiris.  It's daiquiris, but, woo!  But it's called a sacrifice, Ed.  Right.  Sacrifice.  Hold on, hold on.  I don't want to make sacrifices.  But the infant thing only lasts, the infant stage doesn't last 25 years.  Long enough.  By that time, your life has changed so much, there's no getting back to the party and fun.  You've got 18 years before you can do anything.  And you're lucky.  You could, you could get like a nanny to make it a little easier.  I'm talking about the average president.  That figure out stuff and they get nannies and stuff to make it so they can still do stuff. 
[00:38:00]  Dude, 99.9% of the people cannot get nannies.  What they do is they have their babies and it's the end of spontaneity.  It's the end of just picking up and going somewhere and doing something.  For a while.  For a long while.  For years.  For a long while.  Yeah.  Even when they're old.  You've got to take care of the kids.  You've got to take care of them.  Then the kid's going to get it old enough.  He's 16 years old.  You're not going to leave him alone or ruin your house.  It's a sentence.  You can't trust a little bastard.  It's a goddamn jail sentence.  You're in prison.  You're in baby goddamn prison. 
[00:38:30]  It prevents you from doing anything.  I love the idea that this weekend, if I damn well wanted to, I could jump on a plane and go somewhere and be on a beach drinking daiquiris with my chick and not worry about where the baby is.  If your dad thought like you, you wouldn't be here.  And thank God my dad was an a-hole and had children.  Your brother wants in.  Brother Joe.  Do you agree with that?  Yes.  It wasn't.  Your phone sucks.  We'll wait until he comes in. 
[00:39:00]  I'm sure he's coming in with Laird at some point to plug bar nine tonight.  Why don't we take a break?  Anthony, dad was a pod person?  Will just, yeah, my father fell asleep next to the bean pod.  He woke up and had three kids.  I'm just worried about it because my girlfriend's talking about having a kid and I black out.  But she's actually looking around the apartment thinking this place isn't baby safe.  And I told her me being the father of a child isn't baby safe.  Right.  You're a hazard.  What am I going to do?  What are you going to tell the kid? 
[00:39:30]  He'll figure it out.  What are you going to figure out?  I've seen you break everything you own.  I know.  You're horrible.  I guess it's horrible.  I had a goldfish.  It died.  I mean, come on.  And kids eat like every day I've heard.  It's always about the feeding and the caring and the change this and the whole, the partnership  dynamic between the husband and wife, the guy and the girl.  All of a sudden it turns from becoming this impassioned thing about effing and being in 
[00:40:00]  bed and sucking and doing things to you change them.  You wash them.  You bathe them.  You take them here.  You do this.  And where does that leave room for your poor schlong?  Where does that come in?  What do you want to name the kid?  How about bear trap?  Don't you want a minivan?  Some of them are kind of sporty with sporty names.  I got my SUV.  I got my Jeep.  We had a whole discussion.  Like guys calling up trying to tell us how minivans are cool.  They're not just because they renamed them with, you know, sporty names. 
[00:40:30]  I got stuff around my house too.  Baby kangaroos can choke on things I got laying around the house.  Everything I own, every possession I have is one millimeter by one millimeter big.  Just big enough covered in lead paint.  Right.  Lead paint.  I have burning cauldrons of wax just sitting around for aesthetics.  I don't care.  Hot coat hangers all over the floor.  That's all you need. 
[00:41:00]  I have apples with razor blades as displays just all around.  Is there anything worse than somebody telling you a story about their kid and including  the, like, like, ah, like, like, ah, just trying to express how cute and how smart the  kid is and the whole time you're thinking, I really, really wish you would have fallen  down the steps in the third month.  Not because I don't like the kid because your story is awful.  And they're telling you with the kid drooling like a carrier monkey all over your stuff.  It just becomes fully involving. 
[00:41:30]  The child or children become the parent's life.  There is nothing.  Everything else is at least second place.  Usually third or fourth down the way.  She's my little pride and joy.  I got a quick story.  I was at a sushi restaurant in Huntington.  Shushi.  Shushi.  Shushi.  Shushi.  How was it, Rich?  Shushi.  Shushi.  Hey, sushi.  And we're sitting there, nice little place, you know, everyone's sitting around enjoying 
[00:42:00]  their sushi.  Yeah.  And this couple comes in with a newborn.  I don't know, kid's maybe eight months old at this point, right?  They're getting ready to sit down right next to us.  The kid starts projectile vomiting water all over the restaurant.  That is beautiful.  They were so mortified and they just had to turn around and leave.  They didn't even offer to clean up.  They just knew they had to get the F out of the restaurant.  That is great.  The parents don't understand. 
[00:42:30]  We don't think they're cute.  We think they're annoying.  Remember at Philly when I got to the airport very early after my jaunt back to New York  to get cigarettes?  Cigarettes, yeah.  I came back and we went right to the airport to go to sleep.  Here, here...  You're right.  ...is what showed up.  You would make a horrible parent.  Dude.  I like doing spontaneous fun things.  He went from Philly to Manhattan to get cigarettes.  And then back to Philly so we could fly to...  To Buffalo.  Right.  It was great.  Picked up and went.  I didn't care.  He's like, not a care in the world, nothing. 
[00:43:00]  And here...  Me trying to sleep at the airport.  Here's what a parent let the child do for two hours.  Oh, my God.  There's a visual.  There's a visual.  What are you doing?  Dude.  Are you having a nervous breakdown?  No, this is what I heard.  Back and forth.  Back and forth.  Can we get that on video? 
[00:43:30]  For the website?  Get Steve in here.  Your little legs.  Don't the people see other people trying to sleep?  They don't care.  You don't see...  You don't say, grab your little friggin' rat and say,  Hey, hey, see the person sleeping?  It's not nice to make noise.  They don't give a crap.  Now the parent's exhausted and has given up.  Not my problem.  Because they think that we're supposed to help raise their stupid children.  Right.  And you know what?  We don't care.  I don't care about your kids, man.  They are so goddamn inconsiderate. 
[00:44:00]  You don't want to have a family either?  I'm not knocking families.  I'm not going to have a family that intrudes on other people.  I'm going to have...  The kids are going to behave themselves.  If I have a kid someday, I will.  And kids are fine.  It's the parents who don't control them.  It doesn't take a village.  It takes you.  Yeah, right.  Oh, Hillary Clinton, of course.  It takes a village.  It takes...  Yeah.  Here he is.  Martini Steve.  Martini Steve.  All right, do it.  What, what?  All right, wait, wait, wait. 
[00:44:30]  Wait, you got to explain it again for the video camera.  This will be up on foundrymusic.com.  This is what the little bastards kids did at the airport.  I'm trying to sleep, and the kid is...  Here's where I'm sleeping.  Okay.  One more time.  Right at the camera.  That was what I got.  Steve, label that...  Oh!  The guy was still on the air.  Steve, label that ant has a nervous breakdown.  Just show him running toward the camera. 
[00:45:00]  Inconsiderate.  There he goes.  Woo!  There he goes.  Martini Steve has left the studio.  We're going to break.  Relax.  I hate when they talk to the kid in front of you because they want you to hear the interaction  between them and the kid.  No, they want you to...  Look, I'm making an effort, but the kid's possess is nothing I can do with it. 
[00:45:30]  No, no, no, no.  I mean when it's a friend and they want you to see how smart or cute the baby is.  Like, Timmy did really well.  Don't you know what A plus A is, Timmy?  And the kid's supposed to answer, and you're supposed to go,  Oh, isn't that cute?  Yeah.  Look how cute.  I never acknowledge it.  I never, ever acknowledge it.  But that's all some of these people have.  Exactly.  Exactly.  That's all I have.  And I don't want to hear it.  I'm not interested in all they have.  They're tough, effing luck.  Exactly.  What do I have?  I have a deep, stinky belly button.  That's what I have.  I sniff it on my own. 
[00:46:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show  92.3 K-Rock  WXRK New York  It's The Opie and Anthony Show  92.3 K-Rock  92.3 K-Rock  It's The Opie and Anthony Show  Hey, this is Colin Quinn.  You're listening to The Worst of Opie and Anthony,  and the best is Lady Di and Marion,  so you can imagine the worst.  That's a hugging, loving kiss fest  between Adam Farrar and my brother, bro, Joe. 
[00:46:30]  I miss brother Joe.  Mikey, what's going on?  Hey, how you guys doing?  All right.  Listen, I got to take the other side on this one.  All right, here's the deal.  I spent 20 years in the bars.  I was the single guy.  Anthony, I was you.  No question about it.  I understand everything you're saying.  Yeah.  But here's the problem.  Yeah.  You don't understand the other side.  You are, for lack of a better explanation,  the virgin trying to explain sex.  Okay?  And here's why.  Okay.  Because now I have two kids. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  And what you were saying earlier  about how exhausting it is  to put the car seat in the car  and carry the pack and play  with you everywhere you go.  Pack and play.  He's got to know things like,  the pack and play.  Pack and play.  All right, all right.  Let him finish.  You said it.  Now, here's the deal.  Yeah.  There's nothing more exhausting  than trying to go to the bars.  That's a good tired, though.  That's a good tired.  Yeah, it's a good tired, man.  No, it's not.  It's like this.  Dude, you are post-BeanPod. 
[00:47:30]  You fell asleep next to the pod.  You are not human.  But you're pre-BeanPod.  You can't explain post-BeanPod.  Yeah, I agree with Mike.  You don't get it.  You can't fully understand  because you don't have kids of your own.  You don't have a different outlook  on the whole thing.  I see it unlike he does.  I see it.  I see the child without the love,  that unconditional love  that goes along with it  being your goddamn kid.  That's his problem,  is that he has that unconditional love 
[00:48:00]  for that little kid.  I don't.  Nor does anybody that doesn't have kids.  So when you're at the airport  trying to sleep one off,  and there's one of these little bastards  running around screaming,  I get pissed.  And I look and go,  that guy should tell his kid to shut up.  But you would have been pissed  if you didn't spend the whole night  getting cigarettes in Manhattan.  Because I could.  I could pick up and go.  I could pick up and go anywhere I want  at any given moment.  Passion on this subject scares me.  It should. 
[00:48:30]  It scares me.  It's all about...  You're out of your mind when it comes to life.  You know what it's about?  You know what it's about?  What?  Freedom!  Were you loved...  It's about freedom.  Were you loved as a child, Anthony?  I think so.  I was a little latchkey kid.  Something's going on in that head.  I'd get home from school.  Something is going on there.  No.  No.  Something happened to you as a kid.  No.  Did you get the proper love?  Did you get to play Little League?  No, I didn't want to play Little League.  I played Little League.  Joe played. 
[00:49:00]  I watched TV.  And I played with dinosaur models.  That's what I did.  Do you see these parents treating their kid, I don't know, and you didn't get the attention  when you were growing up?  No.  No, no.  I'm going to play psychologist here.  Nothing about attention.  Because your passion is...  It's scary.  It's all about my life and the way I like to lead it, and I like the freedom of being able  to do things, go places, go to some strange, faraway, exotic land like Miami, and just at 
[00:49:30]  a moment's notice.  And I don't like, on the other hand, when parents with children step on my freedoms.  You know what we did?  See, we saw a lot of frustration in the old man growing up.  That's true.  Okay.  He always wanted to be like a cowboy or a biker or do things that having kids really did  not fit into.  A cowboy.  He ended up...  That's what he ended up doing.  He ended up...  That's what he ended up doing.  He moved to California.  And became a cowboy.  He got horses and cattle.  Call it him a chore. 
[00:50:00]  Call it stupid, whatever you want.  But this is what me and Anthony are very, very passionate about.  Not being tired.  I don't have a pet.  He knocked up mom with Joseph.  I don't have...  And had to get married.  Pretty much.  I don't even have a pet.  And then two kids later, he's sitting there going, holy crap, I'm stuck.  So he never wanted you guys.  And that, I think, plays into this.  Whether he never wanted us or not, I know when I was hanging out in California, he was  damn happy to have me out there.  Well, that's good.  You know.  That's good to hear.  It was kind of nice.  Well, because he missed the pack and play years.  Yeah.  Yeah, no pack and play back...  Back to you, it was pack and play. 
[00:50:30]  They had the barbed wire bassinet back then.  They just didn't know.  There's this.  Goddamn, kids.  There's my father's mind.  Yeah.  God, this would be great.  I could be a cowboy.  What?  Joseph, shut up.  I'm having the cowboy family.  Oh, shut up.  I could be a cowboy.  I could do that.  I'll go out to California.  I'll get off. 
[00:51:00]  Rosemary, shut that kid up.  I can't be a cowboy.  I have kids.  I can't be a cowboy.  He became a cowboy.  He couldn't afford to buy a horse.  I know.  That was the problem.  But, but, it's...  I think...  There he goes.  There goes Pops.  Happy trails, Dad.  Oh, and that goddamn kid yelling again. 
[00:51:30]  It's Joe.  Oh.  Joseph, quiet.  I'm a cowboy.  On a steel horse, I ride.  I'm walking.  Oh, the kid's crying again.  Rosemary, feed that kid.  You're pregnant again?  Oh, it's the Italian law.  We gotta call him Anthony.  Don't you believe in birth control?  Jesus Christ. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, what the hell?  They weren't packing no rubbers back then?  Shut the kid up.  I'm a cowboy.  Oh, boy.  Look, I got my six-shooter.  Oh, I just shot Joe.  Yeah.  Oh, I don't know.  Maybe that is it.  Maybe I saw, like, Pops really didn't want to be a parent.  He was pigeonholed.  He couldn't do anything. 
[00:52:30]  He couldn't do the things he wanted to.  It was always the way it was supposed to be back in the 50s when they got together.  All you ever heard about was, well, you got out of school.  You went into the army.  Then when you got out, you married a girl.  And you settled down.  You settled down with a nice girl.  Why don't you settle down?  Like Henry settled down with a nice girl.  Oh, the biker?  Yeah. 
[00:53:00]  Bro, bro, I'm taking Joseph and putting him on the gas tank and driving him around the neighborhood.  Oh, you're not.  That's what he used to do.  Dude, he had to.  What did he have?  He had, like, an old Yamaha.  Yeah.  Little piece of garbage.  I think it was, like, a 500 or something.  And he used to put us.  And he put me up on the gas tank.  He put me on the gas tank and my brother on the back and right around the neighborhood.  No helmets.  They didn't know about helmets back then.  Yeah, you didn't have that.  It was back in the days.  They didn't know.  Cigarettes helped you. 
[00:53:30]  They cured lung fever.  Cigarettes made your skulls thicker.  Right.  Oh, come on.  Bro, take the kid.  I'm going out with Jimmy McNally.  We're right.  We're right.  We're right.  We're right.  We're right.  We're right.  I'm going down to the bar.  That was the four-finger dude, wasn't it?  Yeah.  Jimmy McNally's four-finger.  I'm going out to the bar.  You have to freak us out.  See, at least your father wanted to do something.  My father was exhausted.  He didn't want to do anything.  All the time.  All the time.  Your pop is exhausted. 
[00:54:00]  Tired.  See?  From being a parent.  Yeah, from working and being a parent.  Ugh.  The best thing we did, he took us to Adventureland on Long Island and put us in the bumper cars.  You know, with the big sticks that goes up.  Yeah, with the sparks that come down on your head.  Sparks that fry you.  Yeah.  He was so tired and aggravated, he had to take us there.  Go ahead.  Hit something else.  Hit it.  You wanted to ride this?  I don't want to hear your asses burning from the sparks.  You made me come out here.  See?  That's a guy.  Now, Big Joe, your dad, was with Louise Wheezy for how many years now?  Forty years. 
[00:54:30]  Forty years of marriage.  They're still together.  Whatever.  Kids.  And you watch, like, Adam.  Yeah.  You know, he wasn't always Mr. I'm on TV, I'm a comedian.  His father had to deal with this guy.  Mechanically?  Retarded.  Retarded.  At one time, we figured, we're going to do the brakes.  Yeah.  We're going to do the brakes on Adam's car.  So we're in Adam's garage, and we got the wheels off, the brake drums are off, and we're  changing the shoes, and Adam's got some grease on his hands.  So, he's wiping the grease off of his hands, right, with a rag. 
[00:55:00]  His father then walks in, and Adam, looking so proud, trying to please his father by showing  him he's not a mechanical retard.  Him and Anthony are here fixing the brakes.  He's wiping his hands, going, hey, Pop.  His father goes, hey, what are you doing?  My chamois.  My new chamois.  Adam had no clue that the chamois used for putting a sparkling shine on that newly waxed  car.  He's wiping grease off on his hands.  And he screamed at me. 
[00:55:30]  He goes, and he screamed at you.  He goes, look, I know he's a moron.  You should know better.  I was working on a car one day.  My father's standing in the doorway with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth, and just  this sick look on his face.  He put his hand on my shoulder and said, son, you're going to have to get a job.  You're going to have to work at something the rest of your life.  This ain't it.  Can you sing?  Can you dance?  Can you tell jokes?  Because this, you're going to go hungry if you have to do this.  He realized. 
[00:56:00]  But that's the other end of the spectrum where the parent was there the whole time.  And see, he's exhausted.  Oh, he's nuts.  My Pop got to be a cowboy.  I call my father now.  He goes, hello.  What's the matter?  I'm married.  And what is his wife's name?  Louise.  Louise.  Wheezy.  Wheezy.  Well, we're moving all night.  To the east side.  Oh, your mama's name is Wheezy.  Deluxe apartment in the sky.  Without out of help, we're moving up. 
[00:56:30]  He doesn't know how to work the hand truck.  He asks where the key is.  I get the show, right?  The job.  My father calls me.  So De Niro, the ship came in.  Then it gets canceled.  He goes, it's a good thing I didn't quit my job.  Let's go to Sally.  She has a problem with all this.  Sally, what's up?  I was just calling.  Some of the things that make me mad about post-pod women, that you can, a perfectly normal  professional woman friend of mine turned into this barefoot subservient wench. 
[00:57:00]  And, you know, the kid spits on her new blazer and she thinks it's cute.  She rates it.  You know, like, oh, that's kind of cute.  She does what to it?  Rates.  Rates it.  Rates it.  She rates the spit up.  Oh, I was ready to really, really like this woman.  Jesus Christ.  And then if she sees, like, if one of these women sees dirt on your face and they don't  even know you, they happily lick their finger and try to wipe the schmutz off your face.  Schmutz.  Schmutz.  Things like that.  It just.  Yeah.  Or if you're tired of the gum you're eating or you don't like what you're eating, they 
[00:57:30]  hold their hand out so you can spit it in it.  And it's just these things.  Yeah, they turn into their whole life.  Let me explain to people once again.  Their whole life is devoted to these little people.  These little children.  But they're not even people yet.  You've got to train them to be people.  They do things that you would never do in life.  Like, okay, spit it out.  Spit it out in mommy's hand.  And it's like, you know, next thing you know, it's the car window coming down, spitting 
[00:58:00]  things out.  Jesus.  All right.  It's just thing and the whole everything.  It's a production.  Everything becomes a Broadway production.  We're going to move the kid.  We're going to move the kid.  We're going to the movies.  We're going to pack it up, pack it up, pack up the children.  It's a huge production.  The play pens, the things.  We've got to get off this subject. 
[00:58:30]  You're going to have a nervous breakdown.  I'm freaking, do you see me?  I'd rather talk about Joe's new look over there.  The kids are evil.  Joe's new look.  Oh, he did.  He's got a new look.  I have a goatee.  I usually had the reverse of the goatee.  Well, I'm packing up the children, putting them in a car.  I need the car seat.  I need the toys.  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Ugh.  All right.  Why don't we break?  We'll get off this.  You're tired, man.  We'll get off this.  What are those Star Trek kids? 
[00:59:00]  Friendly angel, come to me.  That's what the hell they are.  Nya, nya, nya, nya, nya, nya.  Friendly angel, we should know.  Creepy little things.  Far away.  Far away, four, two, six.  We should talk about Joe's.  Friendly angel, come to me.  You're a member of the goddamn thing from Star Trek.  Well, it's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We'll continue in just a bit here.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Let's say hi to Mike Rowe.  We can't get enough of local TV. 
[00:59:30]  God bless you.  We're obsessed with local TV and how stupid it has become.  Can't watch enough of it?  Can't make fun of it enough?  Local news, nothing like it.  That's where I came from.  Well, I didn't come from it, but I worked for a local news station.  Did you?  San Francisco, dreadful, yeah.  San Francisco, local news.  It's all the same, man.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter what town you're in, turn on the local news.  There it is.  Same girl.  Well, not that girl.  Well.  It's the same guy, same makeup, same suit, same story, same well-modulated baritone.  Well, you have the voice for it.  Yeah, you got the crazy voice.  My friend, don't hold it against me. 
[01:00:00]  You got the voice.  Did you do radio ever?  I tried it years ago.  I wasn't very good.  No?  You know, it was okay.  I just, it was perplexing, you know, and.  Tell me about it.  It's just baffling, you know.  I mean, you guys are in the Plaza Suite here.  I mean.  Yeah, this is pretty nice digs.  Yeah, nice people sitting around.  I'm sitting on a red leather couch.  It's just fantastic.  Yeah.  It's supposed to look like lips.  Oh.  We hate it.  Well, I'm sitting on lips then.  David Lee Roth ordered them when he was working here. 
[01:00:30]  He'll do that.  Yeah.  For the week he was here.  That was a heck of a run, wasn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bozy, bozy, bop.  Diddy-bye.  Dave, leave.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Can you get bozy, bop out of here?  Yeah.  Bozy, bozy, bop out the door.  The cleaning crew.  That's not a word.  Waiting to clean up.  You hosting Shark Week.  It's true.  Yeah.  That's good.  We love Shark Week.  It's taken off.  I remember like the first one. 
[01:01:00]  19 years ago.  This is the best show ever.  This is, I mean, I didn't know this either.  I mean, when I got the call, I thought they were kidding because, I mean, if you've seen  Dirty Jobs, I'm not the likeliest candidate to entrust with the longest running franchise  in cable television.  But they convinced me they were serious.  So we said, yeah, sure.  Yeah.  Why not?  And what does it take to host?  Do you have to get yourself into some dangerous situations?  I guess, you know.  Well, I mean, it's, you know, the whole danger thing is as bad as the local news.  It gets trumped up to a place where most of the time you need to look at it, you know, 
[01:01:30]  with one eye sort of shut and smirk on your face.  But the truth is, you know, things scared the hell out of me for about a month straight.  We were in Cape Town.  We were in cages with Great Whites.  We were off the coast of Bimini without a cage and a shark suit.  I was going to ask.  Did the whole cage thing.  Listen, I mean, I spend a fair amount of my average day scared of something.  And I'm not shy about admitting it.  And I was perpetually and consistently horrified for about a month, you know. 
[01:02:00]  And in the end, you know, you learn a little something, you have a few laughs,  and you get a new perspective on sharks.  Once you make it through, it seems like it was really cool.  It's one of the things when you're doing it.  You cross it off the list, and you go, huh, how about that?  I got bit by a shark.  I'll never do that again.  Did one nail you?  Oh, yeah.  Dozens, actually.  Jesus.  Dozens.  I met a complete lunatic and a great guy called Jeremiah Sullivan who invented this shark suit about 30 years ago.  It's basically a suit of armor. 
[01:02:30]  Chain link, almost.  Chain link.  But it's more like hosiery.  It's so, you know, it's so flexible.  So picture 400,000 of these tiny little stainless steel rings, all individually teague-welded overseas by very meticulous people.  And you put the thing on, you look like Sir Galahad on a bender.  Chain mail.  And the job, you know, on Dirty Jobs, you go do a job as best you can and see what happens.  That was the same sensibility for Shark Week.  But the gig was, go make the shark suit and then watch as Jeremy tests it. 
[01:03:00]  But, of course, that was completely nonsense.  You know, you put the suit on, Mike.  You go test it.  So, you know, we basically go off the back of a boat.  We create a chum slick first.  So we've got about three dozen 12-foot reef sharks.  And I'm not even kidding, man.  And these are gray with the big teeth in there just frothing at the water.  12 feet.  12 feet long, 10 feet long.  They go crazy.  We put on the suit.  We jump in the middle of them.  And we sink to the bottom of the ocean.  And we've got a chum bucket down there. 
[01:03:30]  And we basically move the frenzy from the surface to the floor.  And then we let them bite us, you know.  And it's just, it's mad.  I mean, it's crazy.  I've got cameramen around me.  They're looking at me shaking their head.  I'm looking at Jeremiah.  And he's not looking back because his head's where his ass was.  He's upside down being dragged across the ocean floor and shook like a tug toy.  Yeah, now the chainmail would protect against punctures.  Yeah.  But you're still getting the pressure of a bite, which I hear is pretty strong. 
[01:04:00]  And, yeah, they shake and they pull you around so you're still getting the ride of the shark bite.  And even then, it's still half-hearted.  I mean, if these things really, truly wanted to tear you to pieces, they could and they would.  They really don't.  You know, sharks are curious.  They're playing with you.  Well, they investigate with their teeth, unfortunately.  And they don't have the opposable thumb thing.  So all they have to do is just kind of touch you with their mouth and, you know. 
[01:04:30]  They realize that.  Unfortunately, that's also the business end.  That's the business end.  Well, they realize that you're not good eats.  No.  And they let go.  No, especially wrapped in steel.  I mean, it's all putting, you know.  You ever bite into aluminum?  I mean, it's got to be, like, twice as bad as that.  That would be hysterical if the shark felt the same thing.  Like, ow, damn it.  What the heck?  Just kind of swimming away going, my filling, my filling.  You're not doing that.  Shark dentist.  Wait, you can't test that with a great white, right?  You can't let a great white bite your arm like that.  Jeremiah is working on what I can only imagine is, like, a 12th century suit of armor to do that very thing. 
[01:05:00]  But, like I said, he's crazy.  And I don't think he can do it.  No, I think it would be a terribly ill-advised mistake.  One of the rumors that if a great white is attacking, a newspaper across the nose will actually stop it.  Newspaper?  That's actually true.  That's been proven many times.  So should you find yourself in that situation?  With a newspaper?  Yeah, rolled up post.  Reading the Times down here on the reef.  Just headbutt the great white.  You'll be fine.  Yeah.  That way he can bite your head off and end it quickly and not have to be bleeding to death from a leg wound. 
[01:05:30]  You ever see that footage of the woman that gets bitten and then they pull her out and you can see, uh, that's the worst footage ever taken.  Oh, where they pull her out into that boat and her leg is just gone.  Yeah, gone.  The blood is just pouring out of her.  See, here's the thing, man.  I mean, I, I, I've seen that in, what, last year there were nine fatalities, maybe 250 attacks.  Um, three times as many people died from ostriches.  Ostriches?  And I wrangled ostriches. 
[01:06:00]  And, you know, I can see how it's true, but, you know, there's no ostrich week.  The ostrich isn't getting impressed.  No, not very scary.  Also, 200 people died from toasters.  We, we, we, uh, found out that in the United States alone, yeah.  Uh, more people died from vending machines falling on them than, uh, sharks.  Trying to get the change out.  But there, there isn't any vending machine weak.  Yeah, just trying to tip the thing out or something and fell on them and killed them.  Well, a vending machine never chased anyone and then ripped its leg off.  Yeah, perhaps there would be.  If a tab machine ripped your arm off, there'd be, there'd be a tab machine weak. 
[01:06:30]  And you can see the vending machine.  I mean, that's really the thing.  Yeah, true.  You can see it coming.  It's just sitting there, kind of inert, you know.  So, you really have to taunt a vending machine for it to hurt you.  Get some action.  Hey, uh, you also narrate World's Deadliest Catch?  That's true.  God, you got like three of the quarter shows on TV.  I do, yeah.  Yeah, on the same doggone show, too.  Go figure.  Dirtiest job.  Uh, I love World, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Deadliest, uh, what's the name 
[01:07:00]  of the show again?  Deadliest Worst Awful.  Disastrous Catch.  Yeah, it's a nightmare to TiVo, but it's a good show.  Anthony, turn me on.  World's, uh, Deadliest Catch.  Uh, Anthony, turn me on to this show.  I can't get enough of it.  I never thought crabbing would be interesting to watch on television.  You just never knew what went behind it and how dangerous this job is.  No, it's, it's beyond insane.  It's, uh, I mean, if you read the actuarial tables, um, which a friend of mine sent me  before I went up to Dutch Harbor. 
[01:07:30]  I actually hosted the first season.  Um, I'll get back to it in a second if, if you find it at all interesting.  But really what happened, uh, the network called and said, Hey, we're going to do a  story on these crabbers.  And my folks are fishermen, you know?  So I figured, Oh, I, I know a little bit about it.  Where are we going to go?  You know, maybe we'll go down to South Carolina.  Maybe we'll go to the Chesapeake Bay in Baltimore.  Oh yeah.  It's like, no, dude, we're going to Dutch Harbor, Alaska, Bering Sea, dead of winter.  I'm like, Oh, that sounds dangerous.  So I get this actuarial chart and I swear to God, the injury rate on the crab fleet for 
[01:08:00]  an average season is 100%.  If you're on a crab boat and you're fishing for a season, you're going to get hurt in  some way, shape or form.  The catastrophic injury rate is 12%.  That means, that means there's a one in 10 chance, a finger, a crushed pelvis, you know,  something that puts you in a hospital.  What is it?  The mechanisms in the water or something?  Grab your hand as you're holding it.  It's probably a variety of things.  There is so much equipment, frozen equipment, swinging around the deck that these guys have 
[01:08:30]  to know where everything is at every moment.  Huge pots, these cages that they lower into the water and then pull back up and hopefully  for them it's full of crabs.  But as they're doing it, you know, one's coming up after another and it's another guy's job  to dump it and guys are taking and making sure that there are keepers and the small ones  have to be thrown back at all.  All this is happening at once in a frozen environment where you, you know, it would  be dangerous if you were just walking down a sidewalk with that type of ice. 
[01:09:00]  These guys, the boats are just flying all over the place.  A crab pot weighs 800 pounds.  800 pounds.  Every edge of it is sharp.  It's sliding across a frozen deck.  There are 30 like it on deck.  The winds are blowing 40 knots.  The seas are 15, 20 feet.  You haven't slept in five days.  Yeah.  Good luck.  You ask yourself who are the people that do this and the only thing I could find by  watching the show is lunatics.  Complete crazy people. 
[01:09:30]  You got people who have no idea what they're signing on for and you have people who have  been doing it 30 years.  Those, the ones in the middle wash out.  But the final thing on the actuarial chart is the mortality rate, which is one a week.  Now, I completely dismissed all this, right?  I was there six weeks, a year and a half ago.  Six guys died.  Yeah, that ship went down.  I saw three catastrophic injuries.  And I mean, it's the truth, man.  Guys on your ship died or like over the whole...  There were 148 boats in the fleet that year. 
[01:10:00]  One of the boats went down.  Five guys on that boat died.  And while the rescue was going on, a guy got washed over a boat not far.  And if you fall in that water up there, you've got two minutes, maybe.  They had footage of the captain talking, which was really like creepy.  I mean, it was just bad.  What catastrophic injuries did you see?  I turned my ankle on a step in a hotel.  For me.  I mean, have you ever...  That's catastrophic, man.  I slipped on some of my money one time.  You know when the side of the coffee table hits your shin and you're getting water? 
[01:10:30]  That'll hurt.  That'll hurt.  You know, one time I was eating king crab and those are sharp.  And I cut my hand.  Did you get the spice in the car?  And the lemon got in there.  And it was catastrophic.  I was at a crab restaurant and they gave me back my black American Express card.  And that's made of platinum.  What?  Asses.  No, what did you see on a boat?  Like people getting hurt.  The first night I was there, a crab pot came untethered, slid across the deck and crushed a guy's pelvis. 
[01:11:00]  A Coast Guard Jayhawk came and plucked him.  Yeah, they had to take him off the boat.  800 pound crab pot into your hog?  Yeah.  That's got to hurt.  Awful.  You know, I mean, honestly, it is so, it takes a while to get your head around it, you know.  But the reason it's such interesting TV, aside from the human stories, it's just that basic conceal and reveal.  What's in the pot, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  And they're pulling up the pot.  And you know, maybe there's crab, maybe there's not.  I mean, how excited can you be?  Sometimes you find yourself interested in, are they going to get crabs? 
[01:11:30]  Sometimes I guess bear, by the way.  I guess bear.  You never know.  You don't know what's under that water.  Could be a big, vicious bear in there.  Pull it up, it's a tranny.  I got to throw it back.  Hi, tiny, I'm cold.  Get back in there.  Bear week.  You do really, because the people, you watch the show and you realize the people are a little crazy, but they're such personalities.  They have such, you're not going to find a boring guy on one of these boats. 
[01:12:00]  They all have these strange, weird personalities that, yeah, you kind of root for a ship to pull in a lot of crab.  And when you see the captain, you know, using whatever knowledge he has, trying to lay down the pots where he thinks there's going to be crab, and then it comes time where they're pulling up.  You are.  And I wanted to hit myself that I was so interested in if these guys are going to pull up pots full of crabs.  Yeah.  Well, you know, a lot of, I mean, for me, after being up there six weeks, that's when I really started to think about dirty jobs. 
[01:12:30]  This other thing that kind of evolved.  And, you know, there's so many people in the country who are willing to do stuff that most of us, you know, really never even consider.  And what's interesting about the crab fishing guys is, you know, right boat, right captain, and a little bit of luck, you can make 40, 50 grand in a week.  Wow.  Wow.  Now, that's changing because Congress has passed something called the Crab Rationalization Act, which is changing the essential way fishing is allowed to happen.  But for a long, long time, you know, that was the Wild West. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, would you take a pay cut like that to go crabbing?  No.  I have a shellfish out there, so I'm pretty much out of that.  It will make crabs cheaper for you and I, though.  We're the ones that actually suffer in the end.  We're the ones that suffer.  Think about it, really.  I mean, the prices for King Crab are just a little too ridiculous.  The price is very high.  And I don't mean a human talk.  I just mean money-wise.  Are these guys' lives really that important?  I mean, come on. 
[01:13:30]  What else were they going to do anyway?  They were on their last land.  Horrid, man.  They've lost 10 jobs, three wives.  They're alcoholics.  Yeah, you do kind of describe a few of them.  Right, well.  It's true.  And because of that, I got to pay what?  For a lousy King Crab?  Why are they so hard to catch?  Dirty jobs.  Now, I've seen a couple of these where, uh-uh.  Yeah.  I don't know what they're paying you, but it's not enough.  Hundreds of dollars.  I think we should tell Mike.  In the tens of dollars. 
[01:14:00]  I know we're hanging out with a real man here, but I got to tell Mike.  Anthony, germaphobe.  No, no, no, no.  No, don't.  Everyone gets that wrong.  What do you call it?  Jimmy and I call it a germaphobe.  Disgusting-aphobe.  Like, I don't care about germs.  Someone sneezes in the room.  I'm not going to go crazy.  It's disgusting, sticky, yelling things.  What about the straw that was left on your little counter there?  I don't know whose that was.  It had nothing to do with germs.  It was disgusting.  It was like spittle.  Mike Rowe.  There was a bit of spittle on it. 
[01:14:30]  Mike Rowe laughs at you.  You screamed and yelled, and we had to have, like, some kind of hazmat team come in and remove it.  Right.  I needed some Lysol spray.  Disgusting things disgust me.  And with Dirty Jobs, you are in a lot of disgusting situations.  I saw one trailer for one of the shows.  I didn't even understand what you had to do.  Yeah.  And I was disgusted.  It was something with the bones.  Oh, man.  And I think I saw a pig head.  Sure.  A bison head.  A bison head.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:15:00]  And the smell, the faces you make interpret the smell perfectly.  Sadly, the medium in question has not perfected smell-o-vision.  Yeah.  So, if it had, we would never have made it on the air.  The things I have smelled, honestly.  Yeah, you could just tell it reeks.  What was this?  That place was in Oklahoma City called Skulls International.  And this place.  Now, look.  It's funny you mention that one because we've done over a hundred. 
[01:15:30]  And there have only been a couple that have come back from the network that's like, look.  I mean, thanks for trying.  Oh, really?  No.  And we kind of fixed it to get it on the air the way you saw it.  But originally, I'll tell you what.  Every morning at Skulls International is beyond shocking.  UPS comes.  They deliver dozens of boxes.  And in the boxes are heads.  Heads of any imaginable creature.  And what these guys do is they unpack the severed heads and they flens them. 
[01:16:00]  They take the flesh off and they prepare the skulls.  People, universities, hospitals, museums, all kinds of places need fully articulated skulls.  Fully articulated creatures, in fact.  In many cases, they'll send the whole bear.  They'll send the whole dog.  People want their pets turned into skeletons after they've died.  And I don't know why this is, but there is some odd aftermarket out there. 
[01:16:30]  Anyway, these guys do the work.  And they're not ghouls, but, man, I'll tell you.  There's got to be a little ghoulish element in there.  I mean, we've all smelled interesting things just driving down the highway from time to time and wondered, huh.  The whiff.  What is that?  Is it a paper plant?  Is it a treatment plant?  Well, in Oklahoma, if you just, if the wind's right and you turn off the interstate just so, you're hit with a funk that would literally, it just changes the way you look at the world. 
[01:17:00]  And it skulls internationally.  That's bad.  Yeah, it's bad.  It's that bad.  So that rotted carcass smell is like throughout the entire building.  The smell of death.  It's throughout about five square blocks.  Yeah, they have their own septic system.  They have their own everything.  Because they can't tap into anything municipal.  So what do the guys do to get by?  You mean for, like, money?  No, I mean as far as masking the smell, I guess.  Not one thing.  Not one thing.  No, and this is what Anthony...  Because we've heard all those tricks about what do the crime scene guys do? 
[01:17:30]  Vicks under the nose.  All that crap.  They don't do any of that.  Nothing.  Nothing.  They laugh at those guys.  Listen, the human capacity to adapt to whatever hell you're in is truly endless.  And, you know, there are a lot of lessons from dirty jobs.  But for me personally, having done 106 of them, you know, that's not the world I came from.  You know, that's just the world I'm in for the time being.  Well, that's why it's interesting because you're taking somebody that doesn't do it, you, throwing you into a situation like that. 
[01:18:00]  These guys are used to it.  They don't think twice about walking into it.  It's another day at work.  Another day at work.  But you take somebody that isn't used to it, they can really convey how disgusting some of these jobs are.  And we've got to stop right there.  We're really...  Damn it.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Hey, what's going on?  This is Andre 3000, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  You wouldn't visit concentration camps?  If I was there, if I would ever go to the filthy continent that is Europe, which I have no ambition to do, 
[01:18:30]  everyone, especially my relatives, they're, you know, all Italian, of course, like, oh, you got to go to Italy.  You got to go to Italy.  Italy, why?  Why do I want to go?  I don't want to go to Europe.  I would go to England.  You don't even want to go to Suffolk County.  Yeah.  It's too far.  Which, for the rest of America, is the county right next to where Anthony lives. 
[01:19:00]  He doesn't want to cross the border into Suffolk County on Long Island.  I'd go to England.  I would go to Ireland.  Yeah.  And as far as Europe is concerned...  Why would you go to Ireland?  That's about it.  I don't know.  They seem like they have cool pubs.  I'd want to go into a pub and have a Guinness real, you know, Irish pub.  And England seems pretty cool.  Speak the language.  That's another thing.  I don't want to go to France and sit there and have to pull out a little book on, you 
[01:19:30]  know, a medium rare.  How do you say that?  Yeah.  I have no idea.  Where's the craziest place you've ever been?  Craziest place?  Probably Tijuana.  Tijuana, Mexico?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That is a whole nother...  Donkey show?  Filthier than any place.  No, I was a little too young to see the donkey show, but I saw a lot of stuff just on  the street.  A lot of prostitution.  Right there in the open?  Poor little children. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little back alley action going on.  Guy...  I remember seeing a guy just...  Full action.  Not like, you know, little foreplay action.  Full action.  Right next to a dumpster.  And the girl was holding on to the dumpster with one hand and, like, turning around and  watching the guy.  And how old were you?  Probably 12.  So what? 
[01:20:30]  Daddy took you to Tijuana, Mexico?  Yeah.  And we were looking for some bar that he had remembered, maybe remembered going to at some  point when he visited.  And we were walking down some back little alleyway.  And there was just...  You heard the little...  And I remember hearing the little dumpster wheel squeaking as it turned a little bit because  this Mexican was just...  Wow.  And I'm sure your dad, being a responsible father, covered your eyes and got you the  hell out of there, right?  No, it was a big laugh.  And, hey, look at that. 
[01:21:00]  And then I'm sure he made some kind of a Mexican racist joke.  And for the new listeners, I'm convinced Anthony had the greatest dad ever.  Oh, yeah.  Ever.  He got him a girl at what age?  It was my 13th birthday.  13th birthday.  I got a shiny 10-speed bike.  Anthony got a whore.  I got...  No, she was a 19-year-old friend of the family.  No, she wasn't.  Friend of the family.  No, we've known her...  We knew her for years.  She was kind of loose.  You know, she was kind of loosey-goosey around the people that we frequented. 
[01:21:30]  I was going to say, how do you think dad knew that she was going to give you a little  action?  She was very popular around the stable, let's say, around the ranch.  Why?  Was she funny?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A load of laughs.  Is that why she was popular?  Without the laughs.  Was she good at Sudoku?  Yeah.  Really popular.  She...  Yeah.  One time, she dragged me out of a restaurant out there in California because the original 
[01:22:00]  Mexican guy that she wanted to have sex with had passed out in his eggs.  We were all having breakfast after a night of drinking at 13.  And you were 13.  Let's make sure.  Yeah.  And she was, you know, like rubbing this guy's leg and everything.  And he had just fallen asleep in his eggs.  And she kind of turned around looking at me.  And she goes, all right, I guess it's you. 
[01:22:30]  And just grabbed my arm and took me out of the place.  And my father went, I'll see you tomorrow.  And that was it.  You know, back to the house.  Your dad was amazing.  For some action.  I wish I could have met him, man.  Oh, was he a wreck?  What a trooper.  You're just hanging out there drinking at 13 in a bar and then going home with one of the  broads.  I get home from junior high.  It was a short walk from Marco Forrester, Marco Forrester junior high.  And I'd walk down to the stables where we kept our horses and there would be my father 
[01:23:00]  and Uncle Chato, Tio Chato, our Mexican friend, just swilling these huge 40s of bud, just drinking.  And even at that age, I'm just like, why don't they work?  You know, why?  And they were always just complaining about unemployment running rampant.  Oh, geez.  It's so hard to... 
[01:23:30]  And then he'd get like a job for a week.  I was going to say, let's go look for jobs at the bar.  Let's go look for jobs.  No.  Always getting in fights.  Like 13 years old and we'd pull into this underground parking garage under a place called  the Franciscan, which was a big tourist trap because it was San Juan Capistrano, so it  was just full of tourists.  Right, right.  To see the swallows and the mission.  And we'd get out and they were constantly, like my father and all of his friends and  everything, constantly just drunk and starting fights with the tourists because it's like 
[01:24:00]  a goddamn tourist bar and constantly starting brawls.  And I'd be like the little guy.  So I'm the easiest target to go after for these tourists when the fight would break out.  And so like the big guys come running after me and I have to like go bolting up these  stairs.  And then one time I turned around and kicked the guy and he kind of fell down the stairs  a little bit.  And one thing I got to say, my father always did look after me during those altercations 
[01:24:30]  because as the guy was trying to catch his balance on the stairs by grabbing the handrail,  my father grabbed it by the hair and pulled him just off balance backwards and then proceeded  to smash his head on one of those parking blocks in the garage that stopped your tire.  And then all I know is like cops were everywhere throwing us all against the wall.  And there I am, like my hands against the wall, just a little guy getting frisked, took my 
[01:25:00]  little buck knife as my father was making faces at me next to me.  It was just that.  What kind of faces?  Like sticking his tongue out and laughing.  It was just a, it was a mad house.  It was a mad house.  And I want to remind people, you were 13 years old.  13.  He'd throw me the keys to the dune buggy.  Yeah.  Because, you know, not a pot to whiz in or a window to throw it out of.  Right.  But we had to have, you know, horses and dune buggies. 
[01:25:30]  Although we moved every six months because, you know, the landlord was banging on the door.  So he tossed me the keys to the dune buggy and, and, you know, he'd been drinking.  I'd been drinking and just go, ah, have some fun, you know.  And I'd get all the girls from the stable and they were like, you know, 12, 13 years old.  They'd pile in.  And I would just drive like 60 miles an hour down these riverbeds of, of Orange County.  Plowing into bushes.  I didn't know what I was doing.  Could have killed like a whole carload of kids. 
[01:26:00]  We were constantly shooting guns.  It was just the most dangerous situation for children to be placed in.  Hence.  Ever.  The greatest dad of all time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The greatest dad of all time.  It was an adventure.  The, the, the, the biggest thing we did all year was our yearly trips out to the Mojave  desert where we would just go out there and ride dune buggies and shoot big weaponry and 
[01:26:30]  shoot anything that moved until one thing that moved was, of course, I've told that story  before, young Charlie Reyes.  Poor Charlie.  Charlie got shot on one of our outings by his father.  His father was loading up a little pistol and, uh, shot him right in the shoulder.  Looked like a heart shot.  Just whole front of his shirt turned red and, uh, oh, were we out in the middle of nowhere?  Had to just load him in a pickup truck and drive him.  And it was a waterfall of, uh, blood coming out, right? 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  It looked like a water fountain.  Never saw anyone get shot before or since, but, uh, I was looking right at him and heard  the gun go off and was looking right at little Charlie.  He was nine at the time, by the way, nine.  And, and, and when he got shot, he dropped his gun because everyone was armed.  We were just armed to the hilt.  He dropped his gun.  You guys were like a drunk militia.  He looked at his father and just went, oh, and fell to his knees and it like came squirting 
[01:27:30]  out in a perfect red tube that looked like it was actually red blood in a tube.  It was perfectly circular and in a perfect arc that just pumped out.  So we were like, oh my God, Charlie's just shot right in the heart.  That's it.  He's going to die any minute.  So all the drunk parents and everybody just grabbed like anything they could and packed  it on the, the wound and, and in ice and then threw him in the back of a pickup truck  and had to drive him to Arizona because that we were closer to Arizona border than any city 
[01:28:00]  in California.  We were 50 miles in off of a highway.  So we were in the middle of the mountains.  They were called the old woman mountains.  It was an abandoned silver and turquoise mine.  How cool.  And that's where we used to camp and, you know, drink tequila, shoot guns and ride, drive  dune buggies.  And, uh, that was the last time we ever went out there.  That was kind of ended the Mojave desert trips, but Charlie made.  He was fine.  Last I heard when I went out to California, when we went out, I visited Capistrano and 
[01:28:30]  asked about everybody and he's fine.  Richard's dead, but he's fine.  Well, yeah.  Your gay friend's dead.  We'll get into that another day.  Poor Richard.  All right.  The boy that Anthony was seeing growing up.  I was not.  All right.  Uh, this is the ONA virus spreading across America.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  92.3 K-Rock.  Sadie's the...  WXRK, New York. 
[01:29:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  92.3 K-Rock.  92.3 K-Rock.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Slow news day, but this Yoko thing is kind of weird, huh?  Yeah, I guess, uh, she's got, what, a chauffeur and, uh, he's, uh, he's, um, in trouble for  threatening her life.  Well, they arrested him, uh, last night.  And trying to extort money from her.  Yeah.  Says that he has been taping her, taping her personal conversations. 
[01:29:30]  And this, it was odd when I heard it on, uh, the news station when I drove in this morning.  Um, he has embarrassing photos of her, which I thought was just about every photo of Yoko.  But apparently he's got some embarrassing, but there's ones of her, we've seen pictures  of Yoko completely nude with John, with what amounts to, I, I don't know how to put it  here, but it, it looks like what we used to call a pool rack. 
[01:30:00]  Go to your local pool hall where a pool table is.  Look at the rack you used to rack up the balls with and now go to a barbershop.  I'll give you time.  Sweep up the floor.  Now fill up that pool rack with all the hair from the floor.  That's what's been photographed on Yoko.  And he's got more embarrassing photos than that.  The cover of the, what, what album is that?  With her naked and John naked.  Uh.  Yuck. 
[01:30:30]  Uh.  John spooning with her.  Uh.  Yuck.  Uh.  I don't know.  I wasn't a very big John Lennon fan to tell you the truth.  He was totally.  Not, not solo.  Huh?  He's taping her in the car.  And he's denying any wrongdoing, but they have two different, uh, evidence of where he is.  What, driving?  That would be embarrassing.  Her driving.  Just making wrong turns and cutting people off.  Blinker on.  Uh.  Yoko, two million dollar extort ordeal.  A conniving chauffeur blackmailed Yoko Ono with embarrassing tapes and photos he claimed  to have secretly recorded. 
[01:31:00]  Then threatened to kill the widow of Beatle John Lennon.  Did they need to add that?  Uh.  For refusing to pay John Lennon, who played in the band The Beatles.  Right.  It's Yoko.  Couldn't they just say, uh, you know, John's widow?  I think we know.  You know who Yoko is?  They had to say the widow of Beatle.  Beatle John Lennon.  The Beatles had a few hits back in the 60s.  Yeah.  They don't want you to, you know, be confused with the other John Lennon out there.  Right.  For refusing to pay two million in hush money.  Uh.  They arrested this guy. 
[01:31:30]  Hush money.  At his Long Island home.  Ono, uh, blew the whistle.  As he was let out of the 20th.  Blew the whistle.  Blew.  Blew the whistle.  As he was let out of the 20th Precinct Station House on the Upper West Side last night to  go downtown for booking on a charge of attempted grand larceny, the handcuffed Carson made  his own shocking allegation that Ono.  Oh, no.  Handcuffed.  Oh, not that Carson.  Sorry.  The handcuffed Carson made his own shocking allegation that Ono had sexually harassed him. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  Blech.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Turk, too.  He's a Turkish guy.  Yeah.  Like a Turkish military guy.  Yep.  See the two of them all tangled up.  His nickname is Coco.  Ew.  It was Yoko and Coco.  Are you kidding?  No crap, man.  Too bad there wasn't a little crazy Spanish boy.  He would have been Loco.  Too bad they didn't sing with Kaz Elliott.  They all could have choco'd. 
[01:32:30]  His quote.  His quote.  She said Mark Chapman wasn't a worse shot.  She would have croco'd.  I'll keep going with awful, awful rhymes.  She's just trying to stop me from pursuing a sexual harassment case, is what he was saying  last night.  When asked specifically if 73-year-old Ono had made unwanted advances, Carson boasted, oh,  so many times.  Really?  Yeah.  His ego just needs a stroke-o.  Of course, Ono is denying these allegations. 
[01:33:00]  You think Yoko Ono's had sex since John Lennon's death?  I'm going to guess she has.  Probably some Upper East Side or Upper West Side art dealer.  Like an art guy.  Just some boar who has like long hair over his collared shirts.  Like a Spalding Gray hairdo.  Yeah.  Some crushing, horrible boar.  Because she's a boar.  Yeah, she really is.  She's tediously boar. 
[01:33:30]  She has nothing.  She's never said anything I've wanted to hear.  No.  You can't.  The story gets better.  Cops said Carson gave Ono a rambling two-page type note on Friday, the 26th anniversary of  her husband's murder, complaining about long work hours and threatening her with audio tapes  and photos that would embarrass her.  He wanted the $2 million or he would go public.  Does this stuff ever work?  Scumbag.  Do these little scams ever work?  I'm sure they do.  You never hear about them.  Extortion like that?  I'm sure.  People write a letter? 
[01:34:00]  If you're just taping her in her own car like that, just to blackmail her, just what  a vulture.  Yeah.  Just be shot.  Along with the threatening letter, Carson allegedly told Ono he had been her lover, gave her a  photo in which she's wearing revealing nightwear.  Oh, boy.  Agh.  And showed her another photo of a box filled with video and audio tapes purportedly with  hours of potentially damaging footage.  He has her recorded talking against the British government and the American government and Sean 
[01:34:30]  being derogatory about his father.  Big deal.  Ono immediately denied being Carson's lover during the heated confrontation.  At one point, she threw her pocketbook at him.  If I don't get the money, I'll kill her.  Well, if it was full of all the money she's got, that could have hurt.  Yeah, right?  Jesus.  It's not if it was full of her album sale receipts.  Or her talent.  It would have floated away like it was full of helium.  Yeah, she'd throw the purse in.  Nice wind would have just taken it. 
[01:35:00]  My fucker book.  My fucker book.  That's right.  Funny accent.  Where'd go?  Been here how long?  Come on, Yoko.  What kind of embarrassing footage could you have?  She's playing that full metal jacket part.  All me so horny and she's just acting it out in a house coat.  Craig on Long Island, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, if these allegations are true, isn't she going to look like a dodo?  Like a dodo?  Ah. 
[01:35:30]  I curse you today.  But he didn't do it right.  No.  Is that dodo?  No.  It's, uh...  You know, that was just a bad joko.  See, sir?  See?  That's how it's done.  And Coco.  Uh, Jimmy on Long Island.  Jimmy?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I already tried to embarrass you, but I turned out records in public.  Oh, yeah.  That would, uh...  Not be good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, we have Rock and Roll Circus, one of our favorite things ever. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, yeah.  Jay Moore turned us on to this.  It's a, uh, a little film that the Rolling Stones did.  They invited their friends to some kind of circus tent, and everyone in the audience...  My friend!  Everyone in the audience had to wear, like, uh, rain slickers, like yellow rain slickers,  if I remember correctly.  They were high.  They were as high as you can get.  And they invited their friends, like, uh, who's in this?  I gotta remember, uh, Jimmy Page and Eric Clapton.  Peter Frampton?  Peter Frampton.  Maybe.  Maybe.  I just said that.  I don't think so. 
[01:36:30]  Uh, Jimmy Page, definitely.  Eric Clapton, definitely.  Uh, Foundry, uh, John Lennon, and Stephen Carr.  Stephen Carr was there.  We performed Pendulum.  We all shine on.  John Lennon, of course, with Yoko.  And, uh, basically, I think they all just dropped acid, got really high, and then they  went for one of these all-star jams.  Yeah.  Ugh.  So, you got, uh...  Stephen Carr.  You got the Rolling Stones on stage. 
[01:37:00]  You got John Lennon singing with Mick Jagger right there.  It's worth the price of admission.  You got Jimmy Page.  You got, uh, Eric Clapton.  All on the stage.  It's a classic rock and roll moment.  And they are jamming, doing one of these, uh, all-star jams, and then effing Yoko steps  up to the mic and wrecks the whole thing.  Why?  Why did she have to open her freaking mouth?  Why didn't John Lennon tell her, stay home?  I know.  Uh, for everybody that loves, uh, uh, John Lennon and his music and everything, for all 
[01:37:30]  that, he was the most whipped guy for not just, you know, telling her, hey, could you back  off?  I'm the one with the talent that everyone's talking about here.  Yeah.  And it was known back then that if you want John, you get Yoko too.  So the Rolling Stones is like, oh my God, a chance to do something with John Lennon?  All right.  Fine.  It was an awful package deal.  Just the fact that he would enforce her on everybody, self-righteously force her on  everybody.  That's great.  Right.  And she stinks.  Here's a Lamborghini and cancer.  And you don't get the cancer, but you have to put it in the passenger seat and talk to 
[01:38:00]  it.  So from Rock and Roll Circus, here's the all-star jam going down, and you as the listener,  you have to guess when Yoko starts singing.  It's tough.  It's really tough.  Listen closely.  Oh, my God. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, my God.  She just goes on and on with that caterwauling. 
[01:39:00]  Someone's saying, that's what the last three seconds at Hiroshima sounded like.  Oh.  All right, John.  You want to call now?  Wow. 
[01:39:30]  Wow.  It's a break it down.  I mean, she's doing something that pretty much every human being out there can do.  What's so special about this?  If you even want to go with the artsy angle.  He's screaming.  He's screaming.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah 
[01:40:00]  ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah 
[01:40:30]  Oh, look. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, look.  I can't breathe.  Shut up.  she sucks and shame on lennon oh yeah what point did like clapton go is this a joke oh

[01:43:00]  the opie and anthony show  92 3 k rock it's the opie and anthony show okay here we go  hey this is brett michaels of poison and you are listening to the worst of opie and anthony  well the chimp story is one of the best stories ever yeah we loved this story from the second we  heard it what a couple had a chimp for many many years and then they uh they gave the chimp to some  kind of place where it could live because the chimp was getting a little uh violent so and it was 
[01:43:30]  getting too big you know they're all cute and all like when you're watching the little rascals and  they're dressed in a little engineer costume it was getting a a bit uppity yeah so they had to  take it to this uh shelter uh this place i don't even know where these are it's not a zoo it was like  this habitat for chimpanzees and they took it there and uh they'd visit it and one time they're visiting  it on its birthday and and these these this dope couple this dopey couple brought it a birthday cake 
[01:44:00]  like it's gonna know like it's gonna have any clue it's its birthday and that you're bringing  it a cake and that it even recognizes you know what it knows that uh this couple gave up on it  yeah they gave up that's what it knew at the time it used to have fun watching television in the house  probably like doing human stuff and now it's just sitting there having another monkey throw feces at  it and and and they they brought a cake and they went out into this uh habitat area and apparently 
[01:44:30]  another chimp got a little angry that it wasn't his birthday it was the little jimmy norton chimp  feeling jealous he wanted some cake and they wouldn't give it to him yeah they wouldn't give  it to him because it was it was their chimps birthday well this chimp that didn't get cake  sure showed this guy because first it went and lunged and bit off the old lady's thumb  that's how it started just no cake i'll take your old thumb she was the lucky one yeah she was lucky 
[01:45:00]  she just lost a thumb it got her thumb when the guy then intervened the husband to try to get the  chimp off the wife after uh it took her thumb the chimp laid into this guy and mauled him there's two  chimps that attacked him yeah but the one really like went after him uh it was just  uh the other one was was his chimp and uh it kind of let him go after a while but it was one one  chimp in particular his chimp helped in the attack yeah a little bit oh and then and then was chased 
[01:45:30]  off the chimp he raised helped in the attack it's a chimp doesn't matter they're just like humans no  they're not i didn't realize that one of the ones that attacked them was his yeah briefly and then and  then this other chimp laid into him ate the guys first of all chewed off one of his feet just  decided i'm gonna chew off your foot and bit it right off and then uh uh ate his face took his nose 
[01:46:00]  right took his nose off and just ate and one of his eyes i think he lost like that his cheeks  his chin i mean the chimp was sitting there eating his face like it was dinner like it was just a  steak and then he went on to the fingers then the fingers i don't know how many fingers he lost but  there are quite a few quite a few fingers were lost and then oh my dear god no if you don't think  that's worse uh bad enough adding insult to injury the ultimate insult he went for the groin 
[01:46:30]  he attacked the guy's groin area and completely mutilated it this chimp  because that's what they do that's kind of a a thing that they do they they when they're angry  with other males is is keep them from reproducing in the wild and one way is to rip their their groin  area to shreds and that's what they did to this guy why i didn't realize that one of them was that 
[01:47:00]  really annoys me and it just makes me happy that those hands of course wonderful as ashtrays  keep defending them you animal rights idiots this is what they do to you all the years of love you  give that mammal and attacks you with a friend let me tell you what they gave up on the chimp let me  tell you a little something mr norton if that chimp was where it belonged out in the wild somewhere  i don't think the wilds of nebraska have chimps in them i think people bring them here and then 
[01:47:30]  think that they're so adorable and cute because when there is there anything cuter than a baby chimp  in a little engineer outfit i watch spanky had one or or in the little golf outfit with the golf and  the knickers little golf clubs the monks got your bag it was adorable but then they grow up and they  eat your i did an mtv pilot which went nowhere and i had to work with a chimp how cute was it  it was beyond adorable mikey his name was and i got to spend the day with him and we bonded and how did 
[01:48:00]  the director tell the difference between the two of you um the one that reached into the diapers and  flung was not the chimp i did that when i was hungry and i was too frightened to express myself  it was great it was really cute so we got up there adorable but they get big yeah and then you got  to do something with them so what do you do you send them to these habitats and then you forget  about them you don't go back with a birthday cake thinking it's going to remember you but they do  remember you the gorillas don't do that and apes don't do that the chimps are just vicious gorillas 
[01:48:30]  are horrific but they're not i don't i can't see a silverback and i again somebody i'm sure will  call me tell me i'm wrong but if you just kind of curl up in a ball i don't think a silverback would  do that oh no oh my god have you ever seen the silverbacks in the zoo they are the most frightening  creatures i've ever seen they they will they will sit down and for the most part if you watch them  in a zoo uh they'll they'll kind of just pick at themselves and and look kind of quiet and then  they'll do this thing where they kind of turn their head over their shoulder and give you a little look  with their eyes they open them up and then turn their head back but when you see these things get 
[01:49:00]  pissed and they start rattling around their cage or their the the trees these huge trees and they're  just going crazy and then you see them out in the wild they just rip things apart you do not want  to be near these things when they're mad yeah i think once they know that you're dominated i don't  think they would rip your unless you are fighting them like another gorilla let's try it out yeah  let's do it let's try it out with you let's try it with ben because even if they go into it it's  gonna take them so long to get it ripped off we'll have help there by the time they if you've ever 
[01:49:30]  heard a gorilla go just out of exhaustion for trying to mutilate ben's parts  see the gorilla dabbing his brow yeah oh jeez halfway there  we don't know what's down there we certainly don't all right we got the update though we got  uh chip attack survivor update the latest audio from this great story st james davis sat in a  wheelchair horribly injured nearly killed when he was attacked by two chimpanzees at a kern county 
[01:50:00]  animal refuge last year and said all he wants is to get mo his pet chimpanzee back home  i haven't been able to seal they won't let me into the flames and i i would heal a lot better  if we could be together again  holy  you gotta be me is this idiot trying to get the chimp back 
[01:50:30]  he deserves to have his ripped off and shoved up  it wasn't his chimp that attacked him i'm almost positive yeah i i i apologize for the  extra hair mark to my little friend your little furry friend i remember the story it was two other  chimps i do not believe that his was involved with it and and that's what he wants it back yeah  why would you ever want to see a chimp again exactly i don't care if you raise this damn chimp 
[01:51:00]  did you hear his voice though and if my chimp should be struck by a bolt of lightning  and then i do not forgive i will come looking for those that are responsible look how they  massacred my groin i just want to mow why  chimp's name was mo mo isn't that unbelievable  why does this guy want this chimp back to heal better yeah unless you could teach it to rub salve 
[01:51:30]  it's not going to help you heal it's probably going to finish the meal uh that was your face  psychologically he needs this to happen cool so he could heal hey uh i never wanted this for you mo  the next clip he explains what happened senator chimpanzee president chimpanzee not groin eat a  chimpanzee you're spilling it you're spilling it look at this god we got to take a break but eddie 
[01:52:00]  in new york grandpa i hope your groin gets better your grandson chips eddie go  yeah listen i used to work in a zoo in like in staten island yeah and they had like 16 chimps and  all of them had babies they're all at the same time so they had to get rid of a couple so they  asked me if i bought one for like i think it was like three thousand dollars how are you allowed to  have one they said they said you can buy it you had to get the show you to pay for everything the 
[01:52:30]  shots and everything but there was like a total package came out to like six grand so six large for a  chimp so i waited a little while and i thought you can borrow it so i forgot the six grand i bought it  if you get one from birth they're the easiest things to raise like a little kid but like when  this one got his name was that bed he went went to beat the crap out of you yeah they they like all  of a sudden have a temper tantrum and they'll start swinging those long arms around and it's over 
[01:53:00]  johnny well they do things to you that another chimp would you know can tolerate without yeah it would be  nothing because they're uh you know they got that uh retard strength but i'm almost positive  if anyone knows the story that the two chimps that attacked he had cupcakes or something and they  wanted them and instead of just giving them up give him a cupcake this dummy tries to explain to a wild  monkey these are not for you no no not for you take the thumb all right have these any your pet 
[01:53:30]  chimp ate your uh iguana yeah well i had two iguanas too and i had them for like three years  so they're about like maybe a little more than a foot long each oh so you're wow so you were attached  to the iguanas yeah because they show such love and affection iguanas another animal that you have  as a pet just so it's expressionless expressionless unloving nothing you know what i do when i see  someone's pet iguana i grab by the tail and i crack its head on the counter and then i put it back  and go how come he's not moving like an unripe banana rotten reptiles green nothing all right 
[01:54:00]  eddie uh thank you stupid leaf with feet here's the explanation of what happened to this guy  mo the davis's pet was a familiar sight at their west covina home but in late 1999 after an escape  and two biting incidents the city forcibly removed mo to a refuge after the davis's sued west covina  settled by agreeing to pay for a home for mo in baldwin park but that fell through things languished 
[01:54:30]  until last may in kern county when st james and la donna davis went to visit mo on his birthday  and st james was attacked by two other chimps they were shot to death to stop the attack i don't mean  to lay blame completely at the city but if mo had retained been retained here at his residence  obviously the davis's would not have had to gone all the way to kern county to visit where this  attack was precipitated it's a very unfortunate set of circumstances but the housing uh where 
[01:55:00]  what was that had nothing to do with the city they're trying to sew yeah but he's he's contending  his modeling career is ruined they're saying you look good from the other side by the way uh roger  from kentucky oh my god is the dope of the day dope of the day roger roger brown dope of the day  on the instant feedback why the f is xm being censored this is bs if i wanted free radio i would  flush my radio down the toilet and f my mother get with the effing program punch punching out he's

I understand.  Look, look, look, look.  Look, before you give your explanation, we also have to mention that we did find an 
[02:03:30]  InXS CD in your car and Alanis Morissette?  Alanis Morissette.  See, when I used to drive into work with Anne, we were rocking to, like, Zombie.  Rob Zombie.  Come on.  I left my pal.  I don't get to commute with him anymore.  He's rocking to No Doubt.  In the cars.  You are the worst, man.  No, no.  Come on. 
[02:04:00]  It's been a while since we've gotten something on you, Anthony.  No, no.  See, you don't seem to understand that this...  Look, look.  Let's not forget the time you called me to talk stocks and I heard this song in the background.  No!  You will admit that that was playing in the background.  Look, look, I was, I had the goddamn radio and I'm scanning around and finally you picked 
[02:04:30]  up the phone and that's what, where the radio was stopped.  Yeah.  And I started talking to you.  It was.  Oh, man.  There's no explaining it.  I'm sunk.  I wasn't...  Shut up.  I wasn't listening to this.  Oh, man.  I can understand if it was like bye-bye love by the cars or something.  That almost rocks.  But this...  Oh, my God.  No, I wasn't listening to it.  It just came on.  This happened to come on the radio.  Yeah, it was on scan.  And it stopped on cue and you picked the phone up. 
[02:05:00]  What am I going to do?  Hold on up.  I got to get a cool song on the radio so you don't think I'm a tool?  You know?  Well, if you knew the show, yes.  Yeah, I know.  In hindsight, I guess I should have.  You see what I've been doing now, though?  Whenever I call from the road, I try to find a faggiest song to put on the radio.  Hey, Ann.  Just hanging out with this hardcore band.  What's up?  Just wanted to check in with you to see what we're doing on the show today. 
[02:05:30]  Look.  You want to dig up crap like this.  What?  You want to dig it up.  Who had to get an autographed Ricky Martin CD?  Oh, my God, it's him.  Come on.  Come on.  Who had to get it?  Was that Anthony?  No.  I think that was open.  Oh, my God.  You know it was for s***.  Okay.  I'll buy that. 
[02:06:00]  Okay.  All right.  That's fair enough, right?  Fair enough.  Okay.  Sure.  Very good.  Okay.  Are we understanding each other?  Sort of.  While I'm still in litigation?  Oh, my God.  So it's someone else's CD collection that happens to be in your car.  What's his name?  You jerk off, man.  You are the worst. 
[02:06:30]  All right.  You're hot.  We were just having fun, and all of a sudden, I'm the asswipe.  Wait.  Vito's checking in.  Vito?  Yo.  What's up, Vito?  How you doing, guys?  Hey, Anthony, I need my warrant CD back.  You guys suck.  All right, man.  Bye.  Bye, bro.  Oh, man.  I got to just take one of these calls.  It wouldn't be fair if I did.  Fred, what's up?  Oh, and it's just a girl. 
[02:07:00]  Come on.  I know it.  Ben just can't keep a secret.  Hey, guys.  Yeah, what's up, man?  Got those Yanni tickets you wanted there?  Easy.  Smart.  I actually went to see Yanni at the beach.  Ah, okay.  If we're going to be honest here today.  What happened there?  Oh, it was so hot, Anthony.  Oh, my ass.  Yeah, Yanni.  I think I got a little culture in my life. 
[02:07:30]  A culture?  No, that's a few years back.  Yanni.  What was the worst show you ever saw?  Ooh.  Ooh, that's...  Let me see.  I saw REO Speedwagon.  Jackson Brown.  Oh.  I just did Jackson Brown.  That was pretty bad.  Yeah.  All right, let's go to Rob.  Hey, Opie, did you have to go jet skiing with Ricky Martin to get the CD signed?  All right, easy.  We just asked to find people at Sony to help me out for a Christmas present. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That's the truth, man.  That's it.  Yeah, you're not off the hook either.  Going to see No Doubt.  You can wear some suspenders and checkered pants.  Ant's going to dye his hair.  He's going to put a little purple in it.  That would be cool.  Oh, come on.  I'm just going because Gavin might be there.  Come on, man.  All right, Rob.  Disappointing me, guys.  Thank you.  Oh, come on.  Are you getting pounding on the instant feedback yet?  Rob from Long Island.  Hey, Ant, maybe Lilith Fair will hit town soon.  You better get your Backstreet Boy tickets before all your homo friends get them first. 
[02:08:30]  Anthony, are you looking forward to the Mike and the Mechanics reunion?  It just sucks when you say something on this show.  I guess it's Ant's turn in the barrel today.  Yeah, yeah.  You couldn't take Ben to the side and say, hey, Ben, don't tell anyone, but I really need  No Doubt tickets.  Jerry, what's going on?  I hear ABBA might be getting back together.  People are pounding me, you bastards. 
[02:09:00]  Getting severely pounded on this.  What else are they saying on the instant feedback?  Oh, God.  I'm with the police.  I want a warrant for Anthony's apartment to search for Liza Minnelli CDs.  I'm just glad it's not my turn today.  I don't think I could handle it today.  Hey, Ant, you going to the No Doubt show with Gay Marco?  I suck, man. 
[02:09:30]  All right, you got it queued up, Mark?  Oh, you want to take it?  No, I want to check it out.  I want to see it.  What is Nick Carter calling for?  No, I don't think it's that Nick Carter.  I think it's a different Nick Carter.  Oh, I thought it was our buddy in Boston.  Oh, all right.  Nick.  Hello.  Yeah.  I'd like to invite Anthony down to my special show.  I'm from the Backstreet Boys, and I'd like to show them what I've got playing in my pants.  Great.  I want you sideways. 
[02:10:00]  Okay, very, very funny.  Very good.  Just hysterical.  That was great.  All right, Ant, time's up.  Very good.  You handled yourself quite well there.  Thank you.  I made the mistake of actually trying to explain myself the first couple of minutes, and I realized  I was completely insane.  You never explain anything on the show.  You just take it.  Yep.  Going to No Doubt.  All right.  Okay.  That's it.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Good. 
[02:10:30]  Uh-huh.  Going to be looking forward to hearing this song.  Sure.  It's been living up my eyes.  I'm exposed, and it's no big surprise.  Don't you think I know exactly where I stand?  This world is forcing me to hold your hand.  Everybody.  I'm just a girl, a little of me.  We deliver keggers. 
[02:11:00]  We deliver keggers.  Vanessa, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  Anthony, I like No Doubt, but, you know, I'll get you a George Foreman grill if you go  to see Barbra Streisand.  Barbra Streisand.  What do you think?  Get out of here.  What are you, insane?  Barbra Streisand.  All righty.  Bye.  All right.  Bye.  All right, Anthony, let's take a quick break, and we'll be back, okay?  Please.  All right.  The LB and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rod. </pre>
