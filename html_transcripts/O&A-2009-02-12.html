<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with speculation on Joaquin Phoenix's bizarre David Letterman appearance, debating whether his behavior (long beard, sunglasses, Irish brogue, one-word answers) was an act or a sign of genuine mental distress.  This quickly transitioned to a gruesome account of a man dragged for 17-20 miles through Queens and Brooklyn by a vehicle, detailing the horrific injuries and the driver's obliviousness.  Anthony then recounted a failed alarm clock experience and an encounter with an overly zealous environmental activist, sparking a discussion on changing political views with age and their own past activism.  They briefly touched upon the upcoming Mike Tyson book and the film "Milk," focusing on Josh Brolin's performance and the "Twinkie defense."  Brett Favre's retirement and D.W. Griffith's controversial "Birth of a Nation" were also briefly discussed.  The hosts then heavily scrutinized a video of President Obama interacting with a woman at a press conference, expressing strong skepticism about her homelessness and suggesting the interaction was staged for publicity.  A humorous "three seashells" bit from *Demolition Man* was included.

The show heavily featured Henrietta Hughes, a woman who received a house from President Obama, with the hosts using vulgar and derogatory language to describe her and speculate on her and the President's motives.  They also sarcastically commented on the public reaction.  Other topics included listener questions about Soupy Sales' fading popularity, a discussion on baseball's steroid era and Barry Bonds, an intern's social media misconduct, a state representative's proposal to castrate pedophiles, and California's prison overcrowding.  Duff McKagan, of Guns N' Roses and Loaded, then joined the show.  He discussed his career, transition into finance, financial advice, Loaded, and the search for a new Velvet Revolver singer.  Numerous anecdotes about Opie's childhood and a bizarre banana-related intern story were also included.

The interview with Duff McKagan continued, covering Guns N' Roses (and a non-committal response about a reunion with Axl Rose) and his current life.  This transitioned to graphic descriptions of Steven Adler's addiction struggles, shown via clips from *Celebrity Rehab*.  The hosts shared personal anecdotes, including one about a new BMW X6 and plans to damage it,  leading to a discussion of arrests at a party over a bong photo and the Michael Phelps/Kellogg's controversy.  This fueled a discussion on social media's power in boycotts.  A lengthy, humorous, and gross-out description of a king cake followed, along with an impersonation of "Tank Hankerous" offering Valentine's Day advice and speculation on the Sirius XM merger, punctuated with vulgar comments.  A "guess the sound" game involving graphic sexual acts with a watermelon and discussions of similar explicit videos concluded this segment.


The show continued with a caller's naive childhood misconceptions about sex, followed by graphic descriptions of videos from eFukt.com, featuring explicit sexual acts and commentary.  A PajamaGram.com commercial break intervened.  Speculation on Howard Stern's finances and further discussions of eFukt.com videos, including one involving a person with a disability, followed.  The show culminated with a call from "Wheelchair Fred," who, encouraged by the hosts, masturbated with a dildo live on air while engaging in sexually explicit conversation with the hosts until the show's end.

[00:01:30]  beard slicked back greasy long hair sunglasses sunglasses and just doesn't answer anything and  when he does it's in this kind of irish brogue well he was given he was given one word answers he was  chewing gum yeah and there's a suspicion there that maybe he's doing it on purpose maybe he's doing  a little right a little something something so some drugs or something i don't know so what uh i 
[00:02:00]  guess you it's something you're gonna want to check out for yourself today uh we might not be able to  do it justice it was just very weird at times letterman getting really really uh agitated oh oh he  was mad that uh we'll get to that in a second he was mad that uh joaquin was chewing gum so so  joaquin goes all right we'll chew gum takes the gum out and pops it under letterman's desk yeah so  oh is he trying hard to be the uh i don't know i'm a dangerous unpredictable actor i no he was trying 
[00:02:30]  to to have people think that maybe he was on heroin or something trying to be intriguing not even that  he was barely trying to do anything he was just sitting there making everyone uncomfortable  that's the whole thing i think he's trying so hard to do that i'm sorry i'm so distracted they showed  the van run over hamburger man well who's hamburger man that's the guy that got hit by a car here in  new york uh and then another car or van ran him over and dragged him 17 miles through uh through queens 
[00:03:00]  yeah and brooklyn and there he goes  that's the beginning of his 17 mile journey is he okay put it this way the police cannot identify  who he is he uh that one video the show was that his foot oh it was his shoe flying off or something  okay but he was there uh he he got hit by a a car got thrown into the other lane and then uh a couple 
[00:03:30]  of people pulled over one guy stopped and was looking and then a van came and just ran him over  and you see he's there and the van crosses over him and he's gone and he was on a 17 mile journey on  the bottom of that van uh just leaving um blood marks uh uh commissioner uh kelly said um they're  looking for body parts along the route that they took try to identify maybe find a thumb  there's supposedly there's blood streaks all the way too down like a pencil eraser 17 to 20 miles 
[00:04:00]  queens and brooklyn where did he end up in queens right i think brooklyn he ended up in um  coney island oh brighton beach i'm sorry brighton beach that's nice huh did the guy know  that was dragging him no had no clue come on how do you not know people were like pointing and saying  hey you got something under your van it's in broad daylight right and uh he just kept going and 
[00:04:30]  then when he finally stopped somebody said hey there's something under your van and he looked and  that's when he saw what was left of this uh former person something tells me it wasn't 20 mile horror  ride it was probably like a freaking 20 feet horror ride and then the rest was just kind of  you know i don't think the guy was like 20 miles going hey could you stop hey i'm down here hello  was the guy killed on impact they don't know they don't know if he was uh killed on impact 
[00:05:00]  oh danny apparently he was hit by two separate vehicles yeah and so he was hit by the first car  and uh no one's quite sure if he was if he was still alive and then the second car is the one that  actually picked like hooked him and drank yeah we said all that already yeah oh i'm sorry we did all  that already he got um yeah he got hit by the first vehicle and he was kind of crossing the street  right right and then did that squirrel move where he decided i'm gonna go back the other way  and because he made it across i guess the first time he didn't look when he turned around and there

[00:21:00]  opian anthony my neck is killing me man i guess i i slept for once did you sleep funny did you sleep  on it funny i do believe yes that's what they say i woke up around 10 30 i went to bed early last night  and my my girls in the liver uh in the uh bedroom going what's wrong like what are you talking about 
[00:21:30]  why are you waking me up she goes you you were screaming what i don't know i can only imagine  what you were yelling out who knows she goes up you were screaming so you all right i'm like yeah  i was asleep but what i had no recollection that i was screaming you're leaning over a typewriter  maybe when i jumped up i pulled the the neck out i guess the worst feeling were you dreaming don't 
[00:22:00]  shoot me in the office josh brolin that's scary you saw milk huh loved it dude it was a good movie  best actor it's god damn was that a good who had a better performance than him now that you think  about it who's up for best actor you got sean penn and milk jimmy saw the movie because i guess and  saw the movie the day before yeah so now we've all seen the movie good thing it's a good movie it is 
[00:22:30]  good didn't you like how they also how they kind of captured that feeling of the 70s without going  overboard yes i like how they did that you know it wasn't because some some people they cannot  do a piece about the 70s without having to go so over the top that you're like all right we get  it you don't have to drill into my head it's the 70s you know they really had an authentic look to it  and they put some real news clips in there yeah that was like a young tom brokaw and uh walter  cronkite well because you know it was a true story so they kind of added that in my friend had a 
[00:23:00]  little part in that movie he was the uh steve he's uh he's the guy who works with metallica he's the  guy with the mustache the homophobic uh store owner when he first no way the guy that comes up yeah  welcome in the neighborhood like yeah they say that they wouldn't be welcome in the neighborhood  somebody steve yeah that was oh really is he a comedian or something what an ass he was he was  a complete douche no he's actually large assistant he's uh he's just uh he actually and he actually  his friends are short that's pretty cool man yeah it's like oh yeah we want to join the uh 
[00:23:30]  merchants association he's like no we have you know rules in this uh town you know there are laws  there are higher laws yeah god he points to the sky douche but then later it's funny how he changes  his tune later when he's got he's got 300 homosexuals boozing it up in his place yeah  all ready for the night yeah drink out of this empty in those bottles so they can use them  uh best actor you got sean penn and milk brad pitt the curious case of benjamin button 
[00:24:00]  i saw that movie uh it ain't gonna get the job done uh frank langella for frost nixon i saw that  he was good but even but the problem there he doesn't look like nixon no takes it out nixon has  such a unique look that if you don't look like nixon it's gonna take you out of the movie a little  bit then this guy richard jenkins from a movie called the visitor anyone didn't see that no one saw  that he can't that means that he's gonna probably win and then mickey rourke for the wrestler but i 
[00:24:30]  don't think he was acting as as much as sean penn was acting well i think mickey rourke has uh he's  a little bit like that in real life which i mean he was amazing and the movie was amazing don't get  me wrong but now we're talking about the best performance of the year i don't think they want  him out there either yeah i don't think they want him out there cursing sorry jimmy west that's  okay was he not nominated in because mickey rourke won in england if it was a bafta that yeah bafta  and golden globes i think he beat him in both he beat him in both he's won mickey rourke has won 
[00:25:00]  something like 16 different global awards for this performance really he was great that that  means sean penn's gonna win it they're gonna do the old uh sometimes when you're doing it's like i  guess if jamie fox won and so did philip seymour hoffman but it just seems like sometimes when  you're doing an impression of a guy who's uh it's i think a little slightly easier because you're just  kind of watching that guy and mimicking what yeah you see him do and mickey rourke created this guy  yeah all right that's that's a good point when are the oscars another week or two uh 22nd 
[00:25:30]  next weekend next sunday two weeks two yeah a couple sundays out right okay got the night terrors  some people saying do you have the night terrors no i don't think so and we are screaming please  harvey don't recruit me jp cable i have no recollections all i know she was standing there  and i'm like what why are you waking me up she goes no you were screaming so i'm coming in here  to make sure you're okay i'm like oh all right an odd thing to do and i just start screaming i was 
[00:26:00]  just in a deep sleep though you know all right because i didn't get to nap yesterday no nap  deep sleep yes that's what i'm learning but no nap makes for a miserable day after the radio show  it's tough to yeah tough to do anything without that nap we're like either we're like four-year-olds  we have to take our naps our afternoon naps i didn't nap either i said i spent the first part  of my uh my time uh back at my house um trying to figure out my desert eagle shoulder holster 
[00:26:30]  which uh by the way i guess uh because i'm not like a one of those big guys uh it's a shoulder  holster yet it sticks out of the bottom of my shirt it's like the gun's much not short the shoulder  the gun is just giant but you would think they'd have that figured out you would think they do  i'm adjusting straps i'm trying to do everything to tuck it up under my arm and and it's just  the thing weighs a ton so uh i don't know might have to forego that and just go to the range with it 
[00:27:00]  in a uh you really need a little holster for that thing hey doesn't look cooler to have it in like  a briefcase are you kidding the coolest thing is just pulling that this thing aside and pulling  that gun out and just start rattling off some rounds at some targets at the range so fantastic  your shoulder holsters are made for a lighter weapon i believe the desert eagles like for movie  shoulder holsters i think there's a lot of duct tape on the back of the actor when they're uh showing 
[00:27:30]  that kind of holster just swinging around yeah yeah all willy-nilly you can't get the thing out of  the holster fast enough yeah it's just ridiculous unbelievable it's fun am i am i ignorant to not  know that san francisco gays were getting like had to fight for their rights at the latest 78 i didn't  realize that boy then they finally gave it to him didn't they all right take the whole damn city  yeah all right we give in yeah i didn't know it went that long yeah i had no idea because blacks 
[00:28:00]  get really mad when you met when you equate this civil rights struggle of gay people with with black  people black people you're very pissed off you know it's not the same it's a choice they didn't  have to deal with the same stuff and i'm sure they could hide it yeah yeah well they're starting to  great hi can't hide your blackness but uh they and on a smaller level had to i didn't realize they were  being dragged out by cops and beaten up and arrested by cops yeah a lot of stuff going on and the the the 
[00:28:30]  thought process with some of the people especially the religious people and the anita bryant like  that what a c and they show one part where in florida you know they passed a an ordinance where um  gays had the same rights as everybody else as far as jobs go you know they couldn't be fired  for for being gay and having a job uh and then anita bryant comes out and some other people and they  not only want them fired especially as teachers but anyone that knew that they were 
[00:29:00]  gay like guilt by association if you knew a gay teacher and didn't say anything you too would  be fired and and the hatred and the um uh them talking about uh the crimes against god like they  would just talk about god like hey he's right here and he says this isn't good i just spoke with  him i didn't need a bryant was a kook yeah and i we were i was hoping she was dead and then i just was  like how old is she and somebody said she's only 69 years old man she she's hiding obviously she 
[00:29:30]  hasn't been heard from in decades she's irrelevant she's no bag well she was uh she was pretty popular  back then yeah with her causes florida orange juice sales whore popping out oh i know everybody  mind you business with a stupid old miss america look to her where you can't really tell how old she  is what are you 20 or 40 and apparently yeah she's still alive still alive yeah but josh brolin was  in that movie right josh brolin was very good in it he's uh 41 today when he plays that uh when he plays 
[00:30:00]  a little bit of a drunk yep and he goes to the party it's a little victory party and it's all gay  yeah he just he looks like he really wants to go into the party oh boy does he i think he really  wants to i think there's something going on with him they were hinting at that yeah they were hinting  like but they weren't brave enough to really yeah yeah say it a little frustrated that he had a kind  of hold back his own feelings i think uh might have been a little part of that at five years i didn't 
[00:30:30]  realize that the san francisco mayor had been shot to murder the mayor and harvey milk and uh he gets  five years he did five of his sentence right yeah that's just amazing you killed the mayor  in his office yeah and then and then knowingly walked down it wasn't like even a crime of passion  then went and looked for harvey yeah brought him into another room and shot him and it was uh  they called the twinkie defense because they were saying his lawyer just what a shock the junk food 
[00:31:00]  that a lawyer would just just scoop stoop below pedophile standards yeah and he the junk food defense  blamed it on junk food and he was all hopped up on sugar and stuff come on what judges is buying into  this one or jury one that don't like uh what they called queers yeah that's what they uh that's  what they didn't like but you would think he would get time for shooting the mayor at the very least  unbelievable but the mayor like supported and the mayor was only supporting because harvey milk was 
[00:31:30]  apparently supporting his causes a little quid pro quo there sure and then um josh brolin's character  wanted a little favor about getting some psychiatric center out of his uh jurisdiction  and harvey didn't go along with that and uh he won his vote anyway harvey won his vote  without needing josh brolin so uh josh brolin was really like you kind of went over my head you don't  help me i didn't help you you humiliated when he said that you and he kept saying like i can't go 
[00:32:00]  back to my family and my my constituents like he was just feeling yeah completely humiliated when you  hear a guy continually feeling like not just embarrassed but humiliated yeah yeah worry man  by a pixie yeah yeah he was backed in the corner he sure was amazing hey they just showed a um uh a  frank purdue commercial with the younger frank purdue or whatever his son yeah and he you've seen the  commercial before he's walking around with his blackberry uh-huh and he's uh he's either getting 
[00:32:30]  some stats together or he's he's running he murdered chicken yeah he's doing something with  his blackberry the the purdue company they do realize that that commercial is way out of touch  the blackberry he's using just a dumb observation has a short little antenna on it and it's it's a  blackberry that was out maybe five years ago and they just showed the commercial again on tv you know  what they got to appeal to people that have no clue what that is so they got to look at something that's 
[00:33:00]  years old so the old people go is that one of those phones yeah there it is that's the one  they're using portable phone yeah it was like one of the first real blackberries that started rocking  and it was in that commercial just now you should you should be able to walk up to old people  show them a cell phone if they don't know what it is hit them with that thing from uh no country for  old men oh my god just bolt to their head and then drag them 20 miles i ask you this is that 
[00:33:30]  going to happen to us someday like you can't imagine we're going to get older and not be able to figure  out tech stuff but it happened to our parents they were young and hip figuring out all the tech crap  that was out there yeah and when they were living you know through that period tech crap a hydromatic  transmission i understand that you know now that we look back it's just please we've been like  overloaded with technology right the past but are we going to be savvy enough in in our older years 
[00:34:00]  to figure out this stuff or are we going to have like somebody you know uh some younger person looking  at us and rolling their eyes like come on this is what you got to do it's real easy like we're fools  yeah i don't know uh i'd like to say no and that i keep on top of technology but uh i couldn't set my  new alarm clock yesterday if you remember from the earlier portion of the program so uh so it might  be happening already although it is one of those that you pop your iphone into and you could get  your music off your iphone and things like that so apparently my iphone alarm didn't go off either 
[00:34:30]  because it was docked into this thing is an alarm clock it goes off and then and then it just jumps  off your uh nightstand oh it rolls around and it rolls around but it rolls away from you the whole  thing is it just is is set in such a way that just keeps rolling away from the bed yeah and now  you got to chase this damn thing you got to get out of bed there'd be holes that is the thing holes in  my floor right there would be holes in my floor because most people just hit the thing and maybe 
[00:35:00]  you hit the snooze maybe not but in this case this thing jumps and starts rolling away from you so you  got to go find it that's a problem i have a bose alarm clock though oh the bose is the bose rules  it's horrendous those are very expensive the bose yeah and you you curse it every time i keep mine  across the room i have to get up and hit a remote really it goes to concert volume you cannot if you  sleep through that except for 558 i said it for 518 and i get a bed at 530 oh i have a very very weird 
[00:35:30]  number schedule but uh it is you cannot sleep through it you can't let you just said it wrong i've said it  wrong and i've hit snooze too quick and then forgotten to reset it but it's impossible if  you sleep through that quincy better come and get you there's a problem with them i just set the  blackberry don't have to worry about electricity nothing well that's what i usually do with the  iphone but i popped it into this new fangled machine op this new fangled machine and then it  wouldn't uh wouldn't go off gotcha all right we're gonna take a break my god you know we were 
[00:36:00]  talking birthdays while josh brolin 41 rayman zarek of the doors the big 7-0 today yeah wow  what was he the kid was he the kid of the group he was the he was the keyboardist and uh i don't know  how old would morrison be if he was alive oh you can't even imagine him old him shuffling out onto

[00:37:00]  fat ass just trying to keep the dream alive as they do a medley of all of their songs with everyone  else playing along there's something to be said that springsteen pulled it off at 60 he did fine man  yeah different animal there i think yeah uh he took care of himself is what you're getting at and he  doesn't need to have he had the working man look he never had like a rocker look right you know so  if he did gain weight which he did he's he's heavier than he was he's not fat by any means but 
[00:37:30]  you know you still look and go oh that's bruce yeah morrison would have been pushing 66  so i guess ray manzerk was one of the older ones in the band ah all right oh uh as we go to break  it's worth playing again the christian bell versus david f uh after the dentist this this little  mashup thing so i'm on uh was that on when i woke up access hollywood or one of those uh shows  they're playing like and the adorable little boy coming home from the dentist so they're playing

[00:41:30]  willy mays do we didn't understand the uh the old age thing and no i thought we were kid you're just  like hey we got this great i thought we got the great willy mays on the mets get him on the down  slide dear god he was an old 40 like nowadays athletes playing in their 40s it's it's not that  crazy anymore you know when we were growing up and when your favorite athlete hit 40 yeah he was just  getting his you know one last paycheck i remember when tom siever came back to the mets and everyone's 
[00:42:00]  like oh my god siever's gonna be a met again yeah and oh he's just an old man trying to  throw the ball just trying to hit the uh the catcher micky mantle uh when he ended his career  yeah yeah what what i have no idea not in the yankee uniform no florida marlins  you are a do 
[00:42:30]  sure it's very uncomfortable to wait for it but it was definitely worth it  definitely worth it didn't uh didn't babe ruth retire as a brave  yeah yeah babe ruth just had a horrendous who knows that they all have horrendous endings we  were talking about this last week matter up and just a brave with a hole in his neck and  they use his larynx to do the tomahawk chopper he had like saggy skin in his uniform i remember  seeing the picture going oh my god as opposed to the great shape he was in with the yankees 
[00:43:00]  fast motion film run around the oh i understand that but all that fatness started to sag on him  and he looked horrendous i mean baseball should have taken care of that guy at the end and said  look you know what you don't have to do this we have a little money saved you did well by us so we'll  uh we'll uh we'll uh we'll we'll make sure your retirement's okay and there's the video of the guy  being dragged again it's so just um it's creepy to see the van just uh going out of frame with the 
[00:43:30]  guy and there's his shoe sticking out of uh the back bumper if you're just tuning in you'll you'll  read about it later on this morning a guy was dragged for close to 20 miles on all the highways  we have to make around the new york area we have to figure out how to make hit and run proof shoes  oh because they fly off they just fly off your shoes no matter how tight you seem to tie them  why are they so hard to get on when they're already tied right they can pop off like that why can't  you just pop them on i was reading about uh d.w griffith last night oh yeah a birth of a nation 
[00:44:00]  yes one of my favorite movies and uh i had no idea his life ended horrifically did it his life  ended with him just wandering around hollywood no like trying to talk to whoever would who would  give him you know the time of day and he would try to tell him how how you know great he was was he  being chastised by the community oh yeah they took uh his lifetime achievement award away yeah 98 
[00:44:30]  or 99 something like that why stop it you political correct douches as time went by they  they decided that that movie was not a good thing oh of course for the times it was what it was was  but they took away his award and chastised him and by the end of his life he was just wandering around  hollywood uh you know trying to tell people that he was he was somebody just erase the past like it 
[00:45:00]  never happened and and and and just just go along in merry way criticizing stuff in no matter what the  context well they don't like the content of his movie obviously as the years went on but you still  like uh allow him his lifetime achievement award because he was very influential as far as movies  go absolutely he was the first one to use all sorts of different shots and things like that well  wasn't it that the award was named after him and then they renamed the award the dga award used to be  the dw griffith award yeah and then in 99 some head of the uh dga decided that no we couldn't do that 
[00:45:30]  so we're just going to change the name it's now just going to be that's all they did the dga lifetime  achievement award but then they take his lifetime achievement award away i don't think so i'm not  sure i gotta look at it maybe i read that uh it's just wrongness still it's ridiculous the guy uh the  movie made of course um uh birth of a nation kind of glorified the clan i guess you can say  and uh showed the clan like saving white women from evil black men and things like that but there 
[00:46:00]  was an ideology back then and that film kind of reflected it and uh you know good bad or indifferent  that's what it was you know what his defense was too hey i hired some black uh actors yeah hey and  then in this book i'm reading they're like well not really there might have been a couple but most  of them were in black just white guys in black face oh white white actors in black yes oops yeah  oopsie i'm reading this book i think it's called uh heroin and uh genius it's one of my bathroom 
[00:46:30]  books because it's it's it's all these people a to z that were very famous very creative and pretty  much how they died and i haven't found one with a person like i was saying i think last week where he  died at his summer home with a perfect uh breeze coming in the window and it's 80 80 degrees out no  humidity well just not a cloud in the sky everyone dying a horrific death down on their luck  you're every single one of them you love those morbid books and morbid stories well it's it's it's 
[00:47:00]  interesting you know yeah i really look at that that's a movie poster i had no idea i've never seen  a birth of a nation oh it's fantastic i have didn't like the laughs i was hoping for  that's uh in my uh in the hat as being one of the first movies i play in my theater  you should get one of those posters though i certainly should you know which an original 
[00:47:30]  poster for those three oh my god twenty three dollars uh boo  i have to ask a question yeah sure um i look at the monitor over here and danny's very good with  popping things up as we go on the monitor but for the past few days there has been a page that  has been up constantly oh the clam thing and it is sometimes been there for months clam thing i  don't i and occasionally i say it it's what is that that's been up there for a long time man 
[00:48:00]  it made me it made me laugh the other day because demolition man happened to be on as i was  as i had found this picture and uh basically what it is if you've seen demolition man there's this  whole uh like inside joke in the movie about what to do with the three seashells and it has  something to do with the bathroom and and no one knows and the running gag throughout the movie is  how do you use the three seashells well this is a little comic strip that kind of explains how to  use the three seashells and it's a little more uh obvious than i guess you'd imagine it to be so  yeah it's sort of used for hygiene after you have a movement well so step one i think we can read 
[00:48:30]  through some of this step one take two of the seashells and place them between your fingers  to be used like chopsticks yeah or castanets almost uh step two using the two seashells gently pull on  blank to remove them from your blank until bowels have been completely emptied yeah you got to kind  of use it and uh pull it out like a tool like like what like a dog that ate a vein yay and then the 
[00:49:00]  third seashells like pulling a snickers bar out of the mouth of someone who doesn't want to give  it up right with a seashell uh using the third seashell scrape away any blank remnants from your  blank and then of course you dispose of all three seashells in in the uh toilet and flush see what's  the big mystery yeah but the seashells would clog up your drain no your pipes or whatever i just  always saw the future they have popping up uh in between everything else you're popping up like what  is that it looked like first i thought it was some kind of tampon um instructions and i saw that 
[00:49:30]  was a shell or a castanet i didn't mean to distract anybody or it looked like one of those um one of  those uh speculums that they use during gynecological exams i've just always been a fan of like fake  instructional oh yeah like i think my favorite one of all time is the phony uh airplane instructions  from fight club oh yeah it shows everybody freaking out and panicking yeah there's fire everywhere  and it is awesome that whole movie is amazing let's say hi to mike in chicago mike mike hey fellas 
[00:50:00]  what's going on hey hey hope if you had flipped the placemat over you would have realized he kept  his uh lifetime achievement award uh yeah a lot of placement jokes uh placemat jokes coming in  all right so we go from a birth of a nation to black history month we're celebrating we are  kind of to celebrate black history month the opium anthony show is recognizing those historic african 
[00:50:30]  americans without whom this country would not be the melting pot it is today today we honor film and  television star tim russ russ first honed his craft on television with such memorable characters as  security guard number one on amazing stories and officer number two on the new twilight zone  however tim is most remembered for his portrayal of trooper in the mel brooks film space balls  found anything yet we ain't found we beg to differ tim sounds like you found your place in history 
[00:51:00]  and in our hearts stay tuned for more icons of black history on the opium anthony show  steve's doing a really good job with that absolutely yes hey uh we got the obama audio of the i think it  was the homeless woman this uh you know for anyone that's down on their luck out there all you have  to do is get in front of obama somehow one of these press conferences yell and scream get his attention 
[00:51:30]  he'll call on you tell him how horrific your life is and you're going to be all right they're going to  set you up nice easy street a lot of speculation uh as to if this was a setup really uh well here's  this woman a little background she's supposedly homeless um she uh lives with her son in a pickup  truck in some parks they just park and go to sleep i guess the son had a job uh lost his job so they  lost their house this is her story she then as a homeless woman gets into this event that i guess the 
[00:52:00]  entire city wanted to attend uh she somehow gets a ticket to get in and gets right up front to ask the  president to question about being homeless and all of a sudden becoming the face of homelessness in  this country bull i'm not buying it for a second she's gotta i'll show you the face of homelessness 
[00:52:30]  it wears lipstick and yells obscenities at you while you walk into your other job hot yes sexy  you gotta think she's homeless because you could check on that crap you said would be really not  good for the president i would say that she's homeless oh yeah but obama's got people she was  gussied up pretty good to be homeless i'll tell you that she did look pretty good for a homeless woman i  think she might have facilities is what i'm saying she might have some facilities to uh check on that 
[00:53:00]  that would be really bad for the president who's checking no one checks on this son of a bitch  they let him just do everything he's anointing people people are uh looking at him like he's  jesus he kissed her on the cheek and she almost fell down and got cured of cancer  smell you know homeless hear me out i'm sort of with you and i think he has people  that he wanted to get something done like this during the press conference so he gets his people  to go look find someone that's a little down in their luck that looks kind of okay not like scary 
[00:53:30]  homeless like we see like you said hey obama right i'm golden bun right so they search the  street they find this woman she's homeless it's a perfect story here's a ticket to the press  conference matter of fact here is a front seat to the press conference matter of fact we're gonna  put you in the front row and then it's all set up nice perfectly like obama's just looking around  like oh you yeah because she's got to be homeless or this would be really bad if it comes out she  wasn't really bad but i think everything else was a fine setup to get to the point where obama's 
[00:54:00]  gonna have this interaction with the homeless lady probably she rolled her fat cheek this uh  shined it up nice you know damn well this woman was checked out everything they're not gonna let  some homeless person walk up and then have the president walk right up to her like this  don't friggin do this right don't lie this is a big setup a big showboat uh show biz moment 
[00:54:30]  for our new uh uh uh president who's just like every other politician just shut it this woman it  was a plant point she was just a plant in the audience well it helps his uh stimulus package you  know you're also doing the press conference and here's someone down on their luck that shouldn't  be down on their luck that ain't perfect it's a hollywood story the face of homelessness it's  tippy tom homelessness is tippy tom the face of homelessness are kooks they're nuts that's why 
[00:55:00]  they're homeless you don't think tom would have been as graceful yeah right in front of obama i would  have that i would have that oh fantastic hey you're the first president i've ever spoken to  i used to live with batman law we got a dog named bagel let me tell you something probably asked him  if he cried at sophie's choice like he did yeah he yeah it's uh stimulus package isn't right  it's not right the children are taking their children but tippy it is right it'll help you my friend okay 
[00:55:30]  hey yo bobby you gotta be here imagine they f f up they think tippy tom could be the face of the  homeless and all of a sudden tippy tom is yelling screaming that hey you promised i could be on the  stage i could be off on the stage it's uh i i there's shenanigans going on here i'm not sure what  the shenanigans are but then everyone comes out of the woodwork to uh give this woman a home and uh 
[00:56:00]  money and and things like that and they attribute it to like wow look how great everyone is being  now that obama's president everyone's just caring about each other and uh then she goes uh she found  out about the house offer and she goes well i'm gonna have to check that out check it out oh i hope the  rooms suit you what she's gonna wait for a better house maybe ah this friggin that's bs artist 
[00:56:30]  it's nice she's all hooked up crap it's all nice it's a nice little story no it's not it's i don't  know how they got to that story but it's a nice little story it's show business that's what he's  doing he's showboating the lady went to the rally and snuck up front and talked to the president yeah  how does that happen yeah and then he had kooky douche yesterday from the school that got an internship  and everything he's all over the news he's got a thousand yard stare he'll be back to you know being 
[00:57:00]  down on his luck by next tuesday let him have his little time in the sun he's a sweet boy he leans  over and kisses her on the cheek did you notice the uh woman in the background of that shot oh yeah  that's my favorite part well what happened there's a white woman in the background some older white  woman and right after obama kisses this uh homeless woman on the cheek yeah and then leans back you  get a good view of this white woman she's looking at obama like he's jesus and she mouths out the words 
[00:57:30]  i love you obama and and then puts her hands up to her mouth and and blows them like kisses  she is so taken with this man and this show business phony moment he's the president yeah  he's the president what about other presidents you didn't see women fawning over lbj because he was  old they love clinton they love clinton because he was young they love jfk because he was young 
[00:58:00]  it's what the women do they they go after the young president oh like clinton huh the lbj without the l  if hillary clinton was the president there'd be guys out there wanting to have sex with her  might have to throw her a presidential one even though she's a slob absolutely put the just have  the president wow kickbox her calves up by the ceiling oh oh my god that white woman is uh just  losing her mind she is wow in the presence of the lord she looks like kathy bates in misery yeah  i'm your biggest i'm your number one fan obama we can't find obama what the hell you were 
[00:58:30]  supposed to watch that woman's house being hobbled right where's the president i thought you were  no i wasn't i went for coffee where is he that woman is just captivated and he's got to go right  over and give her a kiss on that big fat cheek if you're so homeless how are you fat how are homeless  people hey she's fat all right she's fat there's the big kiss maybe maybe she's got a edemia or something 
[00:59:00]  what now look at the woman look at the white woman look at her look at her watch this look  she she's you missed the i love you obama moment though i think that must have been a different  but she's losing her mind she she wants to kidnap the president what the hell is going on with this  presidency there she is look people like him it's nice he is staring at him we haven't had a president  that that people look at like this i guess jfk is probably the last one not healthy yeah but i mean  you don't look at a president like this a young kind of like rock star the thing kennedy had that i mean

[01:09:00]  it's perfect man you get in front of obama with your problem it's solved immediately they are just  walking up to this man and and he's setting a precedent that is just amazing that at every press  conference some dummy is gonna get up there and ask for a christmas presents from uh santa bama  there's guilty uh there's guilty rich people out there who go all right where's henrietta live  i'll drop off a check yeah there's a woman donated a house to her that's nice staying as long as she 
[01:09:30]  wants that's nice and the woman that donated the house doesn't need that house so apparently not but  it's like every president does this like where they have you know they all do what they have where  where they have where they have these set up moments with and then you have uh you have daryl and  daryl uh daryl lost his family they feel you know it's usually at some kind of a speech and then they  go why don't you stand up and uh take a bow sure that's a moment like that it's planned out they're 
[01:10:00]  invited to these events yeah this woman the the impression they were giving is that she was just in  the crowd here comes this homeless woman just talking to the president everything's off the cuff  then he walks over and uh you know uh washes her feet and uh now she's uh holy me i know i know i'm  saying that they all use these these moments to further their agenda or to make themselves a boy  human they all where's the change where's the change the only one that where's the goddamn change 
[01:10:30]  that he promised we're not necessarily at all methods maybe in some of the results i don't think i  don't think bush ever used that tactic not this one but he oh god they all single out people  and you have uh bush was oh and you have helen was just a weirdo he didn't have a human emotion in  him no he was the bush was very sensitive he would cry with with with soldiers families no i think bush  was a softy deep down really uh it was hard to tell at times once when my father uh threw spaghetti  against the wall i started crying i said i had a tummy ache i had myself a tummy ache he always has 
[01:11:00]  some stupid woman on this is becky or damn i'm never i'm related to henrietta hughes i gotta send  another check yeah i said all i said all right put her on the tail and i don't have to see her  chubby face anymore but i'm white surely hempel needs a house how do we have the same last name if  i'm white and she's black how did that happen something way back jefferson huh most black people  don't have to have white names way back in the uh olden days open oh you think maybe your family  maybe my grandpappy was your family maybe my grandpappy a little white uh-huh megan i was sicilian 
[01:11:30]  we've all seen true uh stories well well the more romance true stories true stories  exactly true romance let's take a break we're late when we get back we got it i've seen true  stories no it's not a show of course it's not aunt anthony what's the name of that picture true  stories with with uh christian bale slater henrietta got me all upset oh i know you get rapes 
[01:12:00]  i call the gillian and calm down it's gonna be okay no one's taking your house and your guns you'll  be all right we'll see state rep wants to castrate sex offenders yeah that's something and we got a  sexist uh folgers commercial from the 60s oh worth listening to today  does she end up on a great outside the uh oh man  hey just a reminder we got duff mckagan stopping by to say hi we had a real good time with him last 
[01:12:30]  time he he was by the radio show yard that'll happen in about 15 20 minutes i was just talking  to travis yeah buds uh buds uh ceiling he might punish a rod for the steroid thing also says he might  change record books to reflect steroids and he's thinking of reinstating hammer and hank erin as the 
[01:13:00]  home run king wow this ain't happening never he said it's something he he won't uh you know say no  to right now won't rule out yeah really he's just getting a headline that ain't happening  you had these monsters hitting monstrous home runs off pitchers that were doing steroids  yeah people forget that part of the whole uh equation yeah yeah the guys were hitting crazy home  runs and they were monsters but the the the players pitching to them were monsters too 
[01:13:30]  or some of them a lot of them and barry bonds has never been proven to do steroids you know yeah  yeah whatever i'm just saying everyone like ceiling hates him but you can't change the record  no not a big fan of uh mr bond he refused to but i i you know he's got the record what are you  gonna do and he can't punish a rod either i mean if there was if there were a couple players that  were on the steroids then maybe but it was it was pretty much rampant yeah it was the steroid era 
[01:14:00]  we talk about this you got to let it be yeah and then you move on to the next year they'll figure  out something else to make themselves stronger and faster bionics bionics probably right secret  bionic secret arms did he have his arms amputated and uh install robot arms who knows they've they've  always cheated in baseball and they will continue to cheat and get away with whatever the hell they can  right because their livelihood depends on it yep i remember the spitballs remember pine tar corks 
[01:14:30]  that was ridiculous they were doing everything they could old uh jolton joe uh dimaggio used to wave  his fingers in front of the catcher's face so he'd uh catch a whiff of maryland  it was very distracting he couldn't make the signals to the pitcher well the catcher was vomiting  billy martin would steal home and the catcher was playing at that time yes and the catcher was  doing this to get the smell out of his face and the pitcher's like what you're waving off the 
[01:15:00]  fastball you're what you're crazy this guy's a monster all right dimaggio breaking ball it's  amazing with that next thing you know it's a 700 foot homer wouldn't wash his hand all night and all  day game time people are very confused they uh remember that i did live with a uh a black uh a  black girl one summer henrietta hughes not henrietta hughes though i mean my parents you know they were  they were church goers well sort of church goers i think they were kind of sucked into the cult because  our centerport is very very culty when it comes to being a catholic yeah and uh they got sucked in and 
[01:15:30]  next thing you know we're we're inviting a black girl from the city to live with us for the summer  like the fresh air fund yeah we had one of those i don't know if it was like full-time i don't  remember i was too young where they used to bus inner city kids yeah i just remember going suburbs  i just remember going to robert moses and uh she was the only one that didn't need suntan lotion i  remember that as a kid i was asking questions and i didn't really get a good answer on that one  that's adorable yeah look at you learning about different cultures when you were younger like that 
[01:16:00]  makes you very tolerant sure well then when my um you know we had a big house and everyone moved  out of the house and to pay the bills they started bringing in people to live in our rooms which was  always weird you know i have fine memories of my bedroom and then fast forward a decade or two and  there's a guy's you know smoking crack you and using our cereal spoons that's a true story by the way 
[01:16:30]  my mom's like god all the spoons they got this like they got this like uh burn mark right in the  middle yeah gee i wonder what that is like you're not that stupid are you who's the dummy that's smoking  crack in my old room or heroin cooking or whatever right sure they had something going on god but they  took in uh a black woman and i told i told the i tell the story my grandma didn't know any better she  was just old school and uh my mom came home and my grandma who was about 80 at the time she goes uh 
[01:17:00]  dotty uh the colored girl needs to see you oh jeez and my mom's like her name is and whatever her  name was at the time but my grandma didn't know she was just trying to tell tell my mom that that's  how they talked back then you know tell my mom that uh it was a different time they needed to talk  state rep wants to castrate sex offenders does he this is a good little story huh  sounds sexy to start with maybe that much more than three million american children are victims of 
[01:17:30]  molestation that's according to the child molestation prevention organization almost half were violated by  repeat offenders talladega county representative steve hurst now wants to surgically castrate  pedophiles whose victims are younger than 12 you take a child that's completely helpless they have no way  to defend their self if somebody does something of this nature to them you have literally just in my 
[01:18:00]  opinion you have destroyed that child for the rest of their life is it an urge they they can't control  well if it is the castration certainly would take care of that and thereby protect neighborhoods  and community communities and future victims that's wonderful that's i don't think so that's a waste of  time i think it just makes them more angry and then they'll just take to killing people because  now they're not doing it for the feeling they're right oh yeah you think you solved uh solved this  that's a waste of time we're not going to start castrating people yeah i think we should but it 
[01:18:30]  ain't happening no i like the fact he's pushing it though i like the fact he's that they're not getting  that there's no the harshness for the recidivism rate among them is extremely high yeah the punishments  are not harsh enough it's it's amazing that you can rape like an eight-year-old or or fondle or  molest an eight-year-old and be out and be out it should be treated like a murder rap where you know  you uh you go away and depending on how bad it is uh even the death penalty but um yeah you know i 
[01:19:00]  think it should be treated like murder where you go to life without parole you can't fix these people  they've said it before there's no fixing them and you know they they go out and uh become uh  members of society that aren't molesting anymore right right they're just looking all the time  see that movie what was it the woodsman or yeah kevin bacon kevin bacon on that park bench  why don't you sit on my lap oh it's such a creepy movie he was just asking  they had a lap that no one was sitting on was he supposed to be rude about it 
[01:19:30]  it was a very sittable lap if you remember of course there's two types of castration  chemical yeah physical yeah uh you hear what they're doing in california castrating um what  you know you got some crowding going on so they're thinking of letting 58 000 prisoners go  oh jesus 58 000 and they did a story last night i guess i was supposed to feel sorry for these guys 
[01:20:00]  because they're living in gymnasiums oh you know uh in a massive group in gymnasiums because they  don't have any place to know a room and the one guy's bitching that he's getting you know he got a  staph infection and stuff i'm not sorry for the staff and and and i want to know what this guy did  that he's in a prison to begin with they're living in a gymnasium getting staph infection whatever  yeah what's going on there and why don't we just build more prisons they have no problem building  more strip malls just keep building prisons people get angry when you say build more prisons because 
[01:20:30]  um you know they say it's uh racist first of all i've heard that um it takes money which could  better be spent on education and things to prevent people from doing bad things and ending up in prison  prisons are such a last resort and they're so archaic opi so you got to think a little more  progressively and think that um there's such uh things out there education right rehabilitation  psychiatric care family planning all this stuff keeps people out of prison yep right so just when 
[01:21:00]  i think i'm just when i think i'm a little liberal then you say something like that and i'm with you  no way oh build them build the walls so high they never see daylight that's what i say bring back the  dungeon bring back the dungeon all right what happened to you last night you're in a bad mood  you're in a bad mood i saw that goddamn henrietta clip that's a nice little story oh she's a sweetie 
[01:21:30]  and i gotta wait a whole nother week for a lot she's sweet how was it it was a good one i didn't see it  yeah can you explain lost in 60 seconds today never i can't do it i really want to get in on that  program just get hurley's version when he tells his mother what happened oh really and then i'll be good  that's pretty much i'll be good on everything yeah why can't they have a youtube video like  lost in two minutes they do two minutes though they absolutely do really and then i could start  watching oh yeah then you'll be all caught up freaking eric gave me the big bank theory 
[01:22:00]  like season one i'm like what i'm not watching this why would i watch this  someone called in and said the show's good someone my brother oops  and so all of a sudden eric gives me the box set i'm like i'm not gonna sit through the big  bank theory what you mean the the show the sitcom oh no i thought you meant about lost like there  was a big bang theory but i'm sorry no we're just that we're talking tv i was thinking of of this  eric likes the worst shows apparently he likes like network sitcoms my brother swears big bang 
[01:22:30]  theory is really good so i don't know but i'm not a sitcom guy no for the most part is 30 rock  sitcom that's a weird sitcom though yeah it's different yeah that is very different quirky  don't have the wacky neighbor and all this other stuff that every sitcom has those just yeah that  the cookie cutter sitcom is just dead i'm so done with them don't even want to watch it can give a  crap i think they're funny i mean there's a lot of cool moments like i what's that one with the 
[01:23:00]  rascally kid on it where the adults will say something but the kid will kind of come in and  say something like aha man this kid's a tiger he's precocious sure is he's a little mature for his age  wise uh yeah well past his years the audience always laughs yeah i don't know which sitcom that  is jimmy i'm trying to stuff someone touches him and gets castrated yeah oh uncle paul that guy i don't  like him and the husband and wife they don't get along you know there's sexual tension there yeah 
[01:23:30]  well you know that's no good the husband's always making mistakes and the uh the wife is a little  hotter than he should be with and she's always she's teaching him a lesson by the end of the episode  she's got something witty to say too about every f up he makes you know husband doesn't know crap  about anything no he's stupid how does he walk or breathe yeah how about this wife you're an enabler  why don't you get out if you don't if you don't like your little relationship you're in somehow  he's earning the cash yeah exactly i want to do a sitcom and i want one of the episodes to be called

[01:24:30]  i don't think i sat through one full episode never sat through an episode of um uh the the the queen of  king or the king queen thank you uh raymond never the queen of kings it was a different show  it was about some fag who'd like to visit henry the eighth  all right do we have a thing we had to talk to somebody about too by the way 
[01:25:00]  what what happened should we discuss that what talk about um the thing  oh oh oh that oh is it his first day back i don't know since then oh he apologized to me  oh did he yeah why did he apologize to you i don't know i'm the one that called him out  all right bring that son of a bitch in because now i'm mad yeah you're now you're mad you've been  mad all morning yeah you're right we've been walking on our tippy toes all morning with you  what happened to you yesterday stop talking to yourself yeah maybe she can record me talking 
[01:25:30]  to myself you apologize to opie immediately come in what steve told you oh did you apologize to opie  well i was here you weren't here yet i guess he was the first person i was where am i oh where was  i was the first person to arrive and he said i'm sorry he actually said do you have a moment i said no  i do not i sit right here i'm in the office first every day i'm in two chairs wait did he  nine o'clock but did he affect the show or you personally i don't even know i don't know how 
[01:26:00]  this went down i do it was a what what i do oh no i really don't know nothing forget it nothing  no i really don't know nothing what you got a facebook account oh yeah i deleted it right  after you left that comment and i didn't when you had your interview to be leaving comments  yeah i said oh well look at that nice thing you're not supposed to be doing  when you interviewed to be an intern did um did steve or or anybody else tell you some of the rules 
[01:26:30]  that are in place now steve is nodding yes some of the rules as far as posting things  yeah i was told no yeah i'm not on message boards yeah yeah because there's a confidence  there's kind of a confidentiality thing we like around here not that there's uh wicked secrets  going around but my gay lifestyle i like keeping it on the dl as they say yeah why i didn't even  think anything of it because at xm we got fans taking pictures and stuff but i mean i get the 
[01:27:00]  whole point of posting it see the thing is you're a little more inside than the fans right so you can  see things say things just and again not like there's huge secrets going on but you just never  know and and we actually yes and there has been instances where the people have been discouraged  from snapping pictures of us through the glass uh the guests on the bleachers but uh the other day i  guess you were in the glass booth yeah i was wearing the phones with uh travis and uh and you took a 
[01:27:30]  picture and said uh learning the phones right at uh at k rock but it wasn't quite a picture of the  phone the phone was there but it was a picture of the window and us doing the show that was that was  the picture and i know uh if i may drag opi into this i know you're not a big fan of the candid shot  while we're on the air being posted kind of a thing yeah not really you know it's not one of those  things that's like yeah yeah you know if we know people are taking pictures video all the time that's 
[01:28:00]  fine but then you post a picture and you know comments on facebook and things yeah i apologize  then i don't accept it i like pictures i take with people i i enjoy taking photos so take take as many  pictures but no no no what i'm saying with jimmy so he's saying it right now so you are allowed by  the way and every intern is allowed to snap as many candid shots of jimmy as they want make whatever 
[01:28:30]  comments you want and then post it on whatever site you want i want that jimmy apparently loves  it what i was about to say was i like pictures i like taking pictures with people but you shouldn't  be snapping photos when people don't know you're snapping them like when you work yeah i always  actually agree with you oh well then forget everything i mean i'm not being self like i take  photos with the guys that come in like we're interviewing duff mckagan i got a photo with him  oh boy yeah well yeah you'll be first in line oh look there you go tim ran in to take again a 
[01:29:00]  picture of you tim that thing will be up on facebook in two seconds are you with your big grapefruit  no all right well hey man no i just apologize to anthony just had one of those you know run-ins i'm  sorry you don't need to apologize forget it i took it down right after you let the comment so he's very  my snide sarcastic comment he's very excited to be here what can i tell you who isn't and he used  to be a fan or you wouldn't be of course yeah a fan that turns into an intern it happens all the time 
[01:29:30]  so you remember us talking about you know postings and things like that as far as message boards yeah  remember an intern that was on a message board and he started uh uh posting and texting with my  girlfriend that was hysterical what yeah yeah this is an intern back at xm when when we first started  and he was actually uh he started um posting and then having like a posting chat with melinda at  some point and she was laughing she goes one of your interns is like posting things and stuff i was 
[01:30:00]  like oh my god get out of here i go okay don't tell him just you know keep seeing what he says and  then on his last day as an intern i called him out on it i was like oh so and then i gave out his  name that he used to uh post under and said you know you weren't supposed to be uh posting i go  you're gonna get a great uh one of those uh recommendations or stuff out of me breaking the  rules breaking the rules all right hit the bricks all right look at you put his pink floyd shirt on 
[01:30:30]  why you there was something else that happened with intern show i just remember all right danny  what happened yeah i thought this should be brought up too uh somebody thought it was a good idea to  try and network with one of our guests oh right taboo number two the interns aren't supposed to um  uh have interaction with our celebrity guests what if they got a project or something they're working 
[01:31:00]  yeah exactly we've had people get in trouble big kev why is he laughing his ass off we're taking a  picture with somebody and things like that well uh when judah was in here the other day joe decided  he was joe again yeah of course joe again the fuck oh i'm offense ah that's okay you left the k out  yeah so uh now what happened with judah well that's actually what i apologized for and wanted to  clear up with opie that uh there was a misunderstanding and what am i a piece of

[01:37:30]  roses fan he claims ever and i'm sure you've heard that a lot over the years and he came in and was  just singing in your face like obscure guns and roses songs and then he proceeded to do something  with a banana that we can't really describe over here but what would you do he was like g his gg  allen impression is what he was doing all right yeah good reference definitely yeah yeah yeah you  know and yeah it just took me by surprise and well the guy why wouldn't it he's talking about his wife  and it's there's a new kid yeah he starts yeah punching himself in the cock and he you know what 
[01:38:00]  though he would be so happy that you remembered that moment even though it's a disgusting depraved  moment yeah he'd be like oh my god he remembers me he's that twisted yeah now he's very happy he  just made his day by remembering the whole story he's on the other side uh he seemed like a very  nice fellow yeah once he gets a couple of drinks or bananas in him well isn't that true with all of  yes indeed it is sir indeed now you uh the whole look at that the wall street journal 
[01:38:30]  you're you're a lot going on a finance guy these days well have you always been it's not like i'm  mr finance guys these days it's just uh um back in the 90s when i i kind of woke up from from the fog  that i'd been in the fog that was my 20s i suppose yeah um i looked around the smoke was clearing and  and i realized at 30 years old i didn't know at all how how money worked you know i really didn't 
[01:39:00]  know what interest rate meant i didn't know any of these things and i at that point it's just i know  you give it to your dealer and he gives you something in return pretty much was hit in my 20s  kind of like that and yeah i mean yeah so i i uh and i i had to fill my time in my days i was  newly sober and i didn't have anything to do you know uh going out and getting hammered all the time  and scoring drugs like you said you know and that takes a lot of time it's a full-time job 
[01:39:30]  so i started uh going through i had this file cabinet with uh financial statements from the  previous six years and i started going through them and i and i really couldn't tell what was going on  it was like hieroglyphics it was and you know what they they i got into a class  to learn about that i didn't want to ask anybody i was i was too afraid to ask i felt like you know  sturdy i should have known all this stuff but i realized once i got into the class that actually  i wasn't alone that yeah most people don't know and we watch financial tv and they're talking about 
[01:40:00]  multiples of something of a stock and you're going yeah great i mean good or bad you know um and and i  i just took a real interest in finance it was it was uh uh it's it spoke to me and i started to  understand how money worked and um and i was able to kind of uh get a grip on my own financial life  and that's what i was trying to do get a grip on my life in general how are you financially after 
[01:40:30]  like the smoke clear were you a mess or were you still okay i i was okay it was really you know what  i found out i was there was guns was such a big band and there was so many factors involved in the  touring aspect of guns and uh so many people getting paid and and so much commission you know  and of course we got we got paid the last and and if you went on late or if you you know we paid all  the all the fees managers still took their their money off the top off of gross thank god you guys 
[01:41:00]  weren't known for going on late though yeah yeah all the all the union uh all the the fees  you're the parents at 11 p.m that type stuff right new york's a great example for that because  madison square gardens you're going late and you and and the cops and the union guys go overtime  there it's quadruple scale so you're paying to play when you when you go on late yeah you're you're  paying a couple hundred grand to play you're losing a couple hundred grand basically so because of  what axel was doing that must have really been annoying because it wasn't you were ready to go 
[01:41:30]  every single time i guarantee it yeah that's and that's i was ready to go but um i'm not even going  there that's okay so i'm just looking at uh we've all that's it's wrong we've all done our reading  yeah and yeah so i i took an interest in that just for my own sake and then when vr got together and  and took off um different publications like the wall street journal started asking me questions 
[01:42:00]  about like the valuation of a band and it started with one interview and i answered with a couple  informed answers to a couple questions and it kind of blew up from there i was this guy kind of knows  what he's talking about yeah the de facto go-to guy after that uh like it or not so yeah and do you uh  do you dabble in a little uh day trading are you a steady steady as a rock blue chip kind of guy  i i don't day trade uh i kind of uh i take positions and i stick with those positions for 
[01:42:30]  the long run and i and i might um you know pair those positions positions out here and there uh but  no i'm i'm as an investor i'm very young not a gambler i'm not a gambler and i'm very young so i'm  look i i don't need to cash in my money right right right it's like you got time to let that's  a lot a lot of people you know trying to make that big hit the big score and you realize if you're a  young guy relatively young guy whatever uh there's plenty of time to just invest and let it sit look 
[01:43:00]  at the track record over the the course of the history of the the market and uh you will do well  in time so you don't have to make that score overnight you should get a job uh believe me i uh i'm very  interested in uh and plus the way you say that it's you're exactly right and and uh i think in  the last eight years or so we all thought we were kind of geniuses because you know why the stock market  was going up oh yeah up and up wait and the real estate market was going can i jump in for a second 
[01:43:30]  you can anthony is the biggest day trader going oh no i have look i have a certain what were you  trading yesterday uh i was getting my ass out of serious all right i was trading general motors there you  go i but but there's money to be made by playing it every day but you have that's let me tell you  that is a small amount of disposable income you have some play money that he's like having fun with  poker all right that's your point just have fun no my investments are my investments that's long  term that's retirement that's the stuff that i don't fool around with but to take a a few grand and 
[01:44:00]  just have a little fun trading some of the stocks you'll learn some stuff from doing it yeah you take  some bumps you you you hit a few things um you you get to know some of these companies a little  more intimately uh so i kind of enjoy doing that um with and again only disposable income you'd never  do that with your retirement well it sounds like you know what that's about then yeah you're right  because it is no different than kind of playing online yeah online poker or going to the track or 
[01:44:30]  whatever else you're going to do you're uh you know something like here's what i like doing and  i've i've done this a lot over the years and especially um when when the uh internet uh bubble was  was uh just before it burst i'm from seattle i was right there oh going down everybody you talk to  your landscaper about trading stocks because they were doing it like everybody was into it but um  i would buy uh puts and call options on like uh google especially now where they're flipping 16 
[01:45:00]  points a day one side or the other you know and then you you cash out you make a few bucks and then  you wait because the next day it's either going to drop and you're going to be able to pick up your  puts uh and sell those so so for people who don't know what that is and and and i i this is perfect  opportunity i i started writing a financial column for playboy they approached me about six  weeks ago i have a column that i write for the seattle weekly and i write just about whatever i 
[01:45:30]  want to write about my dog's flatulence you know i'll write about or whatever um uh they asked me  they approached me about a financial column and and uh i thought about it and i said you know the  only way i'd really be i think a value of service especially right now because we all did we watched  financial news and we all kind of thought we were experts and we got into a lot of trouble with  i will refinance in two years and we're gonna the real estate market's gonna go up and then the 
[01:46:00]  house of cards of course came crashing down and i think a lot of people are like me when i was 30  years old like embarrassed to ask anybody so with this financial column i'm just going to i i started  last week with what was this uh what was the deal with with a mortgage what what what happened there  so i explained it in simple terms not any big financial jargon and so when you're talking about  puts and calls that you might a lot of listeners yeah probably listening to this going huh i've heard 
[01:46:30]  that term those terminology i've explained it a few times on on the air but you know you get new  listeners all the time right so it's yeah it's it's it's pretty much yeah you're you're you can make  money whether the stock goes up and down based on buying or selling the option to buy or sell a stock  so it's a lot cheaper uh you don't have to invest you're leveraging you don't have to invest so  much money you've explained it to me i still don't get it i know i gave money to an accountant 
[01:47:00]  who gave money to a stupid stock broker i lost a little and now i'm trying to get it back i didn't  lose a lot i i pulled out i was sick i told him stop here if it goes any lower than this pull me out  i don't want to lose all this money because i knew that things were kind of falling apart yeah and he  let it go 10 000 below right stuff uh jimmy has a good story though he got in the market at a  perfect perfect place it's amazing actually about six months ago that was when i jumped in  headfirst six months ago i wanted to build a nest egg yeah and as a result the whole world economy 
[01:47:30]  collapsed he literally got in just before everything came crashing down everybody he is the the mush of  wall i ruined he was the straw that you and mad off he was the guy yeah it was jimmy and mad off right  right is it true you got into microsoft and starbucks early it is true but i i think you know  just the myth has kind of grown i i got it there were my local stocks man seattle guy and it wasn't  like i took huge positions uh to it isn't like i bought a bunch of stock in microsoft and starbucks 
[01:48:00]  i just got in i got into a lot of things in 1994 even if you just bought one share you gotta tell  your microsoft microsoft what did you get in that you have to oh god what did i get in at back then  but you know it's it's it's doubled a bunch of times since then i mean i i was maybe 40 bucks a  share but that was in 1994 and and and especially starbucks that was a was a local company it started 
[01:48:30]  at the pike place market i remember when it's starbucks dude they had coffee whole bean coffee and tea  in one place and it was good coffee and i drank starbucks coffee and in it by 94 it had grown  there were stores along the west coast i think do you do all the uh uh research into a stock before  you you buy it or or you ever just realize hey i'm kind of noticing i use this i'm seeing other people 
[01:49:00]  use it and then you kind of just buy in based on that you know i i don't go through and read all  the annual reports or reports i have i have done that for school and and once in a while for my  own stock just because i'm interested in what intel what they're doing next year um but i have a  financial planner that i just talked to he's got a team of people who do all the research you know  and and i just ask him the questions and i trust him i noticed things like um you know before apple 
[01:49:30]  announced their earnings last time which were very good even in this you know crappy economy  i noticed going into the apple store here in manhattan the place is constantly packed so there  i'm hearing the the rings of an iphone everywhere yeah and you're just like you know something i'm  buying apple products and you sit there and go there's something in that there there's something to  be said there there's a story being told perhaps i should jump in people are getting their music on 
[01:50:00]  itunes right right everybody's got an ipod walking on the street yeah maybe apple's a good stock so  that's one of those stocks especially when you get something that's been dragged down by uh uh the  economy or or the sector goes down so you know a certain company that's doing well also gets dragged  down uh what do you look at as as a good buy because everything's been dragged down lately what do you  look at um it doesn't even have to be a specific specific stock but like a sector maybe or well i mean a 
[01:50:30]  a great sector that everybody's talking about once they figure out where what they're going to do  with the quote-unquote bad loans and bad loans are uh these how do you get into this without uh and  make it kind of plain speak um a lot of these banks have mostly good good loans i mean most of the loans  out there are good but we're all thinking all the loans are are bad and foreclosures and bad loans  quote-unquote bad loans these banks have a bunch of good loans too and these bank banks and financial 
[01:51:00]  institution stocks are beat up yeah um once they whoever the smart guys are who are going to go in  there and figure out what's good and bad and these banks are and financial institutions are worth a lot  more than what they're being traded at right now oh yeah a ton more so i don't know when the right time  it's going to be i have no idea but um you know and real estate interest rates are low if you have 
[01:51:30]  a credit score of 720 or above and you have verifiable income you're going to get the loan  you're going to get a good loan and i i don't know if i'd wait any longer i mean you could maybe save  another 5 10 or 20 grand on that place you're looking for in in eight months but if the interest  rates go up at all you're going to pay 30 times that over the life of the loan 50 times i'm never  going to hit absolute bottom to buy an absolute top to sell yeah so it might be somewhere if you 
[01:52:00]  have i've talked to a lot of people hey i got it i got money i have some dough in the bank and i'm  going to first time home buyer should i buy now if i i would yeah i i would if if i had good credit  in in a verifiable gig yeah i probably would i i i'm not i don't want to buy a house right now so  i think it's a good opportunity right now also for um to buy a lot of the some of these beat-up 
[01:52:30]  stocks that are just being dragged down by the economy that are good blue chip companies sure that  you're not looking to make money on in a week but you're gonna i know people are gonna look back in  a year two years whatever it may be and go god damn it i should have bought then when everything  you know when you're looking at this valley in the graph right now this is going to be where people  said damn it i should have bought if you're my age or younger or 50 or 55 i'm 45 it's it the whole thing 
[01:53:00]  is buy low stay for a long time yeah uh you know uh buy low not buy high that was where i went wrong  i figure the higher it is the better buy it is because then you can wait till it dips and then  just dump it what you pay for how old are you though i'm 40 40 so you know what if you would have  not sold those those positions i don't know what exactly you had i don't either believe me it was  they were sellable yeah oh they were sellable yeah when you're facing bankruptcy yeah well you 
[01:53:30]  know if you're not going to catch if this is retirement dough uh right now is a great time to  buy probably any blue chip stock the big ones i saw procter and gavel trading down at like 50  something do you think general motors is going to go under i'm i'm i'm i don't know but i'm i'm you  know we we bailed them out quote unquote yeah and then they what two days ago they just let go a 
[01:54:00]  bunch of people yeah didn't we bail them out to keep those jobs in yeah apparently and yeah detroit's  a place i'd like to go and start start putting some foot up some asses yeah i mean that's that's just uh  it's just not right so are they going to go under i don't i have no idea they said when you're smaller  you don't uh fall as hard so they they're trimming down uh to to try to keep uh that but the thing is  i can't see general motors disappearing from i can't see our our our workforce our country uh 
[01:54:30]  and at under three dollars a share you know you're not making money in a week you're not making money  in a couple of days maybe not even years but that seems to me to be one of those stocks that once  they do reorganize and get their crap together uh and it goes back up what an opportunity to be in  at under three dollars a share on an american automotive uh you know legend uh it just seems 
[01:55:00]  to me one of those stocks that you know i'm i have i have some shares and i'm just holding on to them  yeah yeah i mean you're right i mean you should you have a good way of talking about this stuff  i hope we're not losing people screw them yeah but you know i mean i think a lot of people want  to know about this kind of stuff but you start talking about you say the word stock and people  start to get a little you know hazy eyed and scared and yeah yeah and uh but it is a good time like 
[01:55:30]  if you if you if this is retirement money if you can get in like you say gm or the blue chip stocks  uh it's a great time to buy for you i'm holding on to all my positions yeah because i i'm not  cashing in tomorrow or next year or in five years or in ten years you can't look at your statements  every time and go oh what are you just oh my god just shred them let you know no joke the last ones  that came in they were still in the envelopes i'm like i don't even want to know that's great that's 
[01:56:00]  healthy and i'm not even kidding i mean i could look online if i had to so but it's just the principle  i don't want to get caught in looking at this stuff every month that's and that's probably sage  advice for everybody out there don't look at headline news and look in the bottom right corner  every day yeah and i was online constantly i never had any kind of investment accounts and it was fun  it went up a few grand and then it just didn't i don't hate it i don't know you had hair down to 
[01:56:30]  your ass like 10 months ago it was depressing yanked it out in a fit of self-hatred rage  eating chocolate crying on the toilet yeah like a true fat girl uh duff has a heart out here so  we only have a couple minutes left um loaded so what's going on you're doing some music too duff  yeah which is awesome music is my main my main thing right but this is kind of been fun this  whole financing and writing for playboys is really uh it's a trip i'm getting a lot of feedback and  you know why especially here in new york people really know about that and uh but yeah loaded is 
[01:57:00]  a band i've had for for 10 years and that's right um even during velvet revolver uh loaded we play  gigs for a charity up in seattle it was a band i formed when i was going to seattle u getting  you're going to business school um and we play gigs we go to japan on my spring break and play and  and the band grew and grew and i think the myth of the band grew more uh during the tenure of of 
[01:57:30]  of vr so um when the tour was ending last spring the the velvet revolver tour uh we unloaded decided  let's make another record and it was a it was a great sort of getaway for me to reinvigorate me for  for music it was it was a tough year uh that last probably six seven months with scott it was a lot was  going on and as a musician you start i was losing track with the art and it was it was a lot of just 
[01:58:00]  kind of drama and and uh loaded got me away from all of that and we made this record that really was  one of the most inspired uh pieces of music i've i've been involved with in a long time and i'm really  proud of the record and i'd put it up against anything i've done it's not a vanity project it's  not a side project it's a it's an actual band that we've had and we just went and played europe and  in japan again and we're going to tour the states this spring we have a the single that's coming 
[01:58:30]  out radio's really going for it and and it's it's it's it's a lot of fun and and in saying all this  about loaded and and us touring and all that um some positive things for velvet revolver have  happened i don't think velvet has made our best record by far yet you guys announced we did you  you didn't announce the new singer yet you guys will know we'll let you know yeah yeah no hopefully  it'll be a big announcement whoa yeah but you got the guy definitely can you honestly say you got 
[01:59:00]  the guy you're just not ready to tell everybody yet i think we have the guy yeah are we gonna be  blown away by who it is yeah i don't know so much you um you'll be blown away by the quality  without saying who he is what other bands has he sung for  g purple leds up  um the guy you guys that there was a like three guys in the last three months or so that all were 
[01:59:30]  stellar you know and we'd been listening to like two three hundred guys and you start losing track  is that guy even good yeah he might be stellar i can't tell i don't know you just burn out on  hearing so many people wow is it a well-known guy uh the guy i'm semi-known i was talking to a friend  of mine yesterday i was here in town a friend from uh from anthrax and i was talking to him about the 
[02:00:00]  guy he goes oh like musicians know who he is oh that guy's killer really yeah okay it's kind of one of  those things where we all know he's killer like oh that makes perfect sense why didn't i think of  that so uh uh i so like i said i think we have the right guy there are four other three other  partners i have in vr sure um but i think we're all sort of settling on yeah one particular guy how  do you like how are you in two bands like that though loaded in vr right now it's the next couple 
[02:00:30]  years for me i'm good thing i'm a type personality uh i'm gonna be really busy but uh loaded is a  little left of center yeah it's a quirky band it's got it's a it's got a a lot of humor to it um  and the when i write for loaded it's kind of a different left to center i can take more risks  with with writing and be kind of a bit more artistic that's got to be great when like you said you're a 
[02:01:00]  little frustrated if there's a little too much drama happening uh with uh velvet revolver you know  you can always go there and you have kind of a a sanctuary yeah yeah get away from you know yeah  it's all you know cock and ball jokes and and nice there you go bananas  i'm just making it easy bananas socking yourself  nice uppercut is it the dude from uh space hog because people are saying it's already been announced 
[02:01:30]  the the guy we the dude royston from yeah yeah we worked with him the guy's fantastic i love space  yeah a band not many people know about but yeah right they had a couple big stars was a great song  yeah uh anyway and we worked with royston for about six weeks and and we actually worked with  royston even before we let scott go uh we were going to have royston do that last tour of the 
[02:02:00]  uk and europe with us wow uh that's kind of how strained it got at the end wow let's just cut our  losses now and finish this tour with with royston and royston um was 98 percent there it was no fault  of his own there's just you know you have to have that perfect chemistry and for us to get a new  singer it can't just be good and it can't just be actually frankly great it's got to be amazing  yeah for people to go oh now it makes sense yeah so many fans like yeah velvet revolver fans 
[02:02:30]  guns and roses fans you know loaded fans so yeah you're gonna and you got us looked at yeah we're  the worst critics out of all of the fans and and you know for the fans we want it to be amazing we  can't just go out at this point in our careers and go okay well here's this thing we go this guy up  here yeah so uh you know we our quality control is is pretty stringent right on to say the least i  meant to say in the meantime space hog not stars stars is by the band i am i'm an idiot uh steven adler 
[02:03:00]  do you talk to him uh we're we're in contact uh he's i've always i've never not talked to him it's  not uh i love the guy he's my same age but but i've always looked at him as a like a little brother  he's tortured man he's giving everyone some great tv but that guy is tortured i couldn't watch i  somebody somebody called me and it's it's on tivo at my house that that show the uh the sober house 
[02:03:30]  show and um somebody called and said you gotta see it's this stuff and i turned on and i could  watch about four minutes of it and i my stomach started turning yeah and why would someone say  you gotta see that it's like i'm not sure you know i i'm not sure and i don't i'm not a big fan of  reality tv and and uh it really it really hurt me you know that watching him like that and it reminded  me of a lot of things uh uh both deal in dealing with him back in the like 90 and 91 it was really 
[02:04:00]  sad to watch yeah there he was right there and and people joke about it you gotta be really effed up  to have guns and roses kick you out and it but it really wasn't that funny you know it we did go to  him and go dude it we don't tell anybody to slow down at all this is 90 and 91 and we're telling you to  you know asking you pleading you to slow down you've gone over the line and that line was the 
[02:04:30]  line was yeah it was it really was you um you know and we talked to him as as brothers as loving  brothers and uh um and he couldn't he couldn't pull it back and you know it's it's a treacherous and  an evil disease man and and it'll make you do things that you and i can look at and go what  but i actually understand it a lot more because i i have the disease and uh um yeah i guess it makes  for for like you said good tv a lot of people are talking about it but uh boy he's being exploited 
[02:05:00]  you know dr drew's making believe it's something else but they're just exploiting the guy  he's tortured he's you know has no business trying to live in a sober house especially  you know yeah place for him i guess you know people have asked me about that show and being  a sober guy what do you think about that show and i guess if one person out of all those people  gets sober from that experience well then that that's worth it i suppose but i don't care to watch 
[02:05:30]  it yeah without the voyeurism aspect or even the exhibitionism of of getting high because you  wonder if somebody wants tv time are they gonna are they gonna pick up just because it's more  interesting almost defeats the purpose yeah yeah because we're all i mean  look and i'm an attention whore too to be honest i'm sober so i mean i definitely understand that  had i gotten sober under those circumstances it might have been a lot more difficult  knowing that if i relapsed it would be more more attention focused on me or more tv time or more  love or whatever you know that's interesting i i don't know i i never even thought of it in that  in that way i know i i even in the depths of my my using and all of that i i would never have gone 
[02:06:00]  on tv never no way you know there's the one bit of sense that would still be in there going you  don't want this on film and well on videotape well and plus you know frankly all of the the things  you're running you got a lot of things running when you're using you got this guy delivering over  here and this guy over there this guy's actually everybody thinks he's works on your stereos at your 
[02:06:30]  house you know and all of that would be uh like you said full-time job and you know it took a long  one a long time acquiring all of these different dealers and and their ruses you know and that  would have that house of cards would have came down blown up that spot you know what i'm talking  about right with me alcohol was i got sober very young so the drugs yeah but the booze was the main  one for me yeah that was my main uh how old were you i was 18 when i got sober whoa wow yeah that's  amazing yeah we had talked to him about that before and said like well when you're 18 everyone's a 
[02:07:00]  jackass when they're drinking he's like no he was an exceptional ass he just knew yeah 18 you know  normal people don't do this normal people don't do that you know you know well that's yeah i i'm  amazed by people who get sober that young you know and and how fortunate you are to have your hit  your low and realize it's a low at 18 yeah i was a i was a complete zero i never would have made 30  so you know i'm fortunate he moved on to a sexual addiction oh boy you want to talk about replacing 
[02:07:30]  one with the other holy mac this prostitutes all over the country that are thanking me for quitting  drinking and drugs that's where all of my energy goes yeah well okay hi you look like you need to  hit bottom come over here honey  jimmy's been open with that uh for years on our show there well at least he's open about it and he's  yeah that's what these goddamn shows are about when you when you when you realize you're stumbling and

[02:11:30]  know it's pretty hopeless to watch and it's sad check it out yes i can imagine that oh all right  sitting to your left every day  hey at least i can find my bedroom come on most of the time if not i'd just fall asleep on a couch with  a wine glass in my hand and precariously touched we haven't played this in a while steven adler  uh has been given given some great tv and we're gonna i mean eric gave me these deaths i'm like  i'm not playing this in front of duff mckagan but here's uh steven adler crying about missing slash 
[02:12:00]  i think this was part of celebrity rehab not sober house my main thing is that you're serious about  this because i'm serious about i want my desk my sauce back all right  because it means everything in the world to me  i wish i was dead every day wow he misses slash  he's in he's in hell man this guy absolutely in hell 
[02:12:30]  you know what's this lipoma  shoot it okay yeah i'm seeing it you got anything else we're shooting are you shooting down here  no my neck yeah good face to my neck that's what you're using he was shooting into his neck well  you have to what right into that yeah not the not this one right not the biggie  what right into the artery imagine it just goes right into his brain 
[02:13:00]  if you're all messed up  that's what you're using my main thing right now is sneaking away  and trying to crack that's what you want to do or that's what you know no that's what they've been  yeah yeah wow guys will actually shoot obviously behind their legs uh but there's guys that will  shoot behind their scrotum um you know they do what they do i mean there's guys that shoot uh  to get high i mean there's no veins left that's boy that's using every conceivable vein when you 
[02:13:30]  start doing that it's also harder to find there though people can't see the track marks  oh yeah well yeah feel them with your mouth yeah well if somebody yeah if somebody sees it how do  you do how do you do that if you're just in your seat the wrong way it's a little uncomfortable yeah  imagine all right pulling everything up and put a needle there and then uh one more steven adler uh  punching a china cabinet after talking to slash and then he's uh trashing matt storin in this clip  what'd you do he pressed the side why because i was talking to slash and i don't know i paid 25 
[02:14:00]  cents who's gonna play drums i need a new cellar and i go that piece of that song  and they didn't call him up instead of me that's what i don't know wow it's hard to understand man  yeah hard to understand when did he ever see a stroke right yeah from doing too many drugs  and he's still at it sober house i have one of those episodes were just amazing him wandering 
[02:14:30]  around the house trying to find his heroin man he's in bad shape man wow all right you don't  can't make it how's he gonna make it be surprised how's he gonna get his life back there's people that  uh come off the bowery like like you know real hardcore bums who are just living outdoors that  wind up uh getting so you know boom but i mean you know you know i mean it's like that's definitely  doable i mean uh you just gotta want to uh do it that's all if you become willy you'll do it right 
[02:15:00]  he's not that he's bad but he's not beyond region because people that aren't that familiar  uh with steven adler do yourself a favor and google image his name to see what he used to look like and  what he looks like now it's it's amazing it's the same person it's unbelievable actually kind of  amazing that he's still alive huh it's amazing he's still alive yeah absolutely sometimes you see  people like wow they look terrible it's like well i guess the option is dead yeah i mean look at the  option it beats beats the alternative right sometimes we'll put the split screen up on uh onaradio.com 
[02:15:30]  he's like the walking dead huh he's like the walking dead yeah i mean he seems like a really nice  guy has a good personality people are rooting for him but are they yeah they are reality audience  they don't root for people they just want destruction and and uh hardship and believe me  no one no one cares that's watching the show and dr drew is just looking to you know get his name out 
[02:16:00]  there and it's just it's you're not getting help from a reality show just doesn't i would love to get  him on the show to to ask you know what is he trying to accomplish and would he admit that you  know it helps his name recognition of course it or you know what i mean because there's a major  exploitation going on which is fine we exploit uh people when they're down and out but we but people  know that but with him it's under the guise that he's helping celebrities and yeah and bringing these 
[02:16:30]  issues to everybody else but i don't really i don't know about that i don't really see it that way  you know because he has he's always he's having group therapy and all this stuff that people would  do in this situation yeah but in front of everyone's eyes and i mean and like we said one of the guys  was called up dr drew and he was on the roof and he was thinking or doing drugs on the roof so the  first thing dr drew did was grab the camera crew and ran out to find it yeah why does he just run out 
[02:17:00]  by himself good job and have a little sit down with the the fella on the roof but he had to make sure  it was all film for the the the you know the tv show steve uh oddly enough we just got pitched  adler for uh in studio so if you guys of course of course we would love steven adler to be when is  that going to happen uh soon yeah we would love steven adler how great would it be if he comes in  with a suit and he's like hello guys it was just down on wall street ringing the opening bell  i am into stock i'm into stock just completely cleaned up yeah i'd love to have him in yeah absolutely 
[02:17:30]  that would be a hell of a hell of a conversation all right i think we got to go we went real late  with duff mckagan so yeah before we go can i just give a shout out to somebody who helped me a lot  uh my this guy jeremy who i know over at bmw in uh and he's not asking me to do that but i'm going  to do it he's on on route 17 new jersey i'm driving now an x6 and it's a beast and i love it's nice  everyone who has seen it i mean everyone who has seen it is asking me questions about it really i'm like 
[02:18:00]  the cool guy with the i've never been no you're the cool guy never in my life what does it look  like me it's uh it looks like a isn't that yeah it's yeah that's pretty cool man let me see front  view a little front view action look at jimmy yeah it's uh he's styling it's got uh i like the  windows big enough for a hooker to lean in you have no idea no wonder how uh what damn that step  i'm sorry no no i i tripped mice water stumbled right now where are we at today 
[02:18:30]  nothing about the mouth i figured i'd keep it going for you guys because you almost forgot but  you know what i don't have in it i don't have serious yet because the new chips which you can  get the best of xm package i have to wait a month for so i need to listen to our uh might want to just  wait no i want to get it i'm getting my new car today too man oh now i'm jealous i'm thinking  maybe i should have got the beast dude it is a beast look at that thing it's nice it really is 
[02:19:00]  it smells like i won't even open the windows because i like the new car smell that goes away  yeah driving quickly but they took good care of me it was a lot of people tried to help me a lot of  people were very nice but this is what i ultimately went with it's amazing i i had my heart set on  something and it couldn't happen right and then i went here and just found this i'm in love with it  awesome know what i do because i can't deal with having a new car so i'm gonna get the keys today and  then i'm gonna punch the side of the car get it over with why are you afraid of it getting dinged  yeah so i figure if i if i do the first thing then i don't have to obsess about that you don't have to 
[02:19:30]  kill the person so one big kick to the side and i'm like okay now i'm good you silly goose i lease  it and then i got some kind of insurance on it's not that much yeah which covers like five thousand  dollars worth of damage you're gonna get from the garages and backing up but then again my backup  camera will cover a lot of damages see backing up a lot of people hurt their neck looking over the  thing i just kind of peek into the monitor in the backup camera and they say don't rely heavily on the  all about the backup camera backup camera is a whiz it's wonderful wonderful and it gives you a  little warning yeah beep when you're getting close to something and you look at the camera you're 
[02:20:00]  like i never would have backed this far up without a camera you get right there on the bumper i back  up down the highway this way i can just look at things right in front of the car yeah that camera  thing is pretty much in every car now i mean they're wonderful they're really moving forward with  your with your luck you'd kick the uh car to make a dent in it and uh break your air conditioner  well and heater on your passenger and the floor would fall out of the bottom well and give it  two flat tires what are you gonna do i'm just praying that there's not a third flat tire because 
[02:20:30]  i gotta drive that piece of crap back out to long island and leave it on the side of the road for  somebody to find you have to take a train out of that what time are you going to get your vehicle  uh right after the show i guess i would offer to take you out there but i'm afraid you'll cut a gasser  and wreck the new truck a lot of protein gassers yesterday yes so have i i actually was just i'm  so embarrassed by my farts i actually just leave the room like she knows what i'm going to do because  i tell her like i gotta go fix something yeah and uh she knows it's time for a gasser i just yell i got 
[02:21:00]  a sour stomach leave me alone sour let's get out of here we'll see you guys tomorrow bye  rock and roll continuing with the opian anthony show uh michael phelps on tv there  they're arresting everybody it's so stupid it's south carolina fucking asshole sheriff the stupid  fucking uh sheriff in south carolina yeah uh thinks there's some criminal charges that they could get 
[02:21:30]  on these guys because of the bong picture right what the fuck they've uh i think they've arrested  eight or nine guys at this point what the fucking guy's trying to get a little headline for himself  what's promising though i forgot about this until i saw the michael phelps i was watching tv  yesterday and of course what was it kellogg's dumped on michael phelps well they didn't re-up his  contract it was expiring yeah yes so uh michael phelps fans are starting their own boycott 
[02:22:00]  good kellogg's now i know how and is like you know those boycotts don't work at all blah blah  but this is what i was thinking because now we're all doing whether it's uh facebook or twitter and  all that we're all kind of kind of getting connected and i think that that uh people could finally fight  back with these big corporations using their facebooks and such because they're saying i i think  it was a facebook thing that started this like hey man if you're a fan of michael phelps you know 
[02:22:30]  stop eating kellogg's and let's make our own statement here so they're they're and they're  fighting back a little bit because they're they the potheads mostly they're like fuck this this  isn't right did you get five more info on that because i'm generalizing yeah i understand that but  what i'm saying with with all this uh social networking that everyone's doing it makes it a  little easier to fight back against the corporations and such and this is why i would support it i would  because sorry jimmy just to finish my point when we got fired over the years right all the fans would 
[02:23:00]  get together like we gotta do something but they weren't connected so they were like well i'm gonna  do a uh a protest tomorrow and five people would show up because there was no organization all we  have is danny at the fucking police barrier because it was like kicking an anthill thank you yeah it was  like kicking an anthill and everyone just trying to figure it out but you're not organized but now if  something happens you can pop up pop a message to everybody on facebook or whatever and go look  we're fucked we need to do this so it it's interesting is what i'm saying i would support it 
[02:23:30]  because uh this is this is what fucking scumbags this company is this guy fucking wins 12 gold medals  for this country yeah he wins 12 fucking gold medals for the united states and he smokes a joint  or a bong hit and he's not good for their image right yeah what a bunch of fucking scumbags how many  potheads eat your cereal right come on hold on yeah i mean you got a tree oh give me my food oh oh 
[02:24:00]  sorry kenny was feeling tardy kenny never gets oh so sure you got some sushi i have some sushi  um yes james norton got some sushi i did hold on excuse me open my seaweed salad  ew seaweed salad ew why is that i don't like getting healthy but seaweed it's fucking rules  they just put the word salad behind it right you gotta play the seaweed good i want some seaweed 
[02:24:30]  does it smell like fucking can i see your uh seaweed you can't no you know what it looks like it's not  i you know me i like smelling food can i see no you can't please i will say the avocado i'm not  eating fish in this place yet i don't know if i trust it there's either a mastodon or kenny standing  in front of the camera can't tell which yeah i'm sorry after a talk she can't tell  i'm sorry he's master dumb  um uh espn yeah the guy that uh owned the bong he was stupid enough to put it up on ebay thank you uh 
[02:25:00]  denny miller that's true coming out of philly pot activist rip kellogg's company for dropping phelps  i just think this is kind of interesting and it shows a direction we're kind of going in with uh  this uh social networking bursting with in indig indignation no no bursting with indignation  god thank god you said yes oh i know i could stammer my way through a news story but you know i know 
[02:25:30]  what i know the word indignation and legions of legalized marijuana advocates are urging a boycott  of kellogg's company including all of its popular munchies for deciding to cut ties with olympic  hero michael phelps after he was photographed with a pot pipe the guy made him a fucking mistake  and he wasn't on any drugs when he was uh winning the gold medals for this fine country of ours no  that's the part of him you're endorsing the leader of one of the biggest groups the marijuana policy 
[02:26:00]  project called kellogg's action hypocritical and disgusting and said he'd never seen his membership so  angry i might be right with more than 2300 of them signing an online petition yeah you know  it just doesn't you know everything i just said for the last 15 minutes staff just throw it away  just take it out of the replay you know what it is you're talking about that people getting together  they've been getting together with organizations uh even before the internet letter writing things  like that they belong to church groups whatever the fuck it is and they got results right just by 
[02:26:30]  doing that that was their way to get together so even though there is uh the internet now and you  kind of rally the troops people are apathetic to everything right especially potheads you're just  like ah fuck him who cares let him have his gold medals i just want to smoke a joint he should the fact  that he won that much for this country we should be able to do whatever we really are just a country  full of shitheads yeah boobs yeah uh i i usually don't do this but i'm going to read another paragraph i  usually only read the first two paragraphs you learn everything from the first two paragraphs 
[02:27:00]  paragraphs paragraphs paragraphs uh paragraphs of each story kellogg's had no problem signing up phelps  when he had a conviction for drunk driving an illegal act that could actually have killed someone that  is a fact oh he had a dewee said rob campia the group's executive director to drop the animal to drop  him for choosing a relaxer substance that's safer than beer looks like yes is not uh outrage and it  sends a dangerous message to young people hmm there you go so they're trying dangerous message i guess 
[02:27:30]  we got a long ways to go before we do all truly organize and and fight back a little bit we  certainly do i figured it out i'm going to hire oh boy there you go fox business no karma's in  wow it's a serious charge to liberty to avoid unsolicited takeover serious charge to avoid bid from  charles ergens dish network how about that who are they showing there oh potus oh that's why this 
[02:28:00]  company's in potus stupid potus yeah man  all right and seriously oh gee that you don't want to look at that five-year chart  backroom negotiations reorganize under chapter 11 and then come out uh with your white knight waiting  uh at the gate so to speak but i mean this this the showdown is coming quickly i mean think about it  you've got until uh tuesday uh to believe to figure out something and i think egos are no doubt coming 
[02:28:30]  into play i mean let's let's not question that whatsoever this reminds me of uh you know the whole  microsoft jerry yang yahoo deal you know where yang basically you know cost his uh shareholders billions  and billions of dollars i think whoever gets it whether it's ergon or malone they can make it work  and i think you know obviously shareholders are done um but boy oh boy you know these egos they do  get in the way yeah and you think about it ashley i know we were talking about it yesterday when you  compare the likes of gm stock to what's happened to sirius xm yeah you know 13.6 billion dollar bid 
[02:29:00]  two years ago this month i mean incredible yeah how much is the stock worth now five cents i mean  yeah yeah i mean certainly i think the bankruptcy papers are written up and ready to be put in  uh obviously the big issue is the debt i think overall though satellite costs are coming down and  i think if you got if they got sadly with all these huge contracts but there might still be some money  in there you know um but uh obviously reorganization is the key word here right yep all right guys let's 
[02:29:30]  believe it there we'll continue to watch the song fire everyone not us  that was funny you said just to thank bob for negotiating a contract that wouldn't  stay under the radar yeah that stays under the radar yeah bob had a good strategy  negotiate a crap contract for us i'd imagine i would imagine whoever's taking over this uh this  company would be doing some uh renegotiating and we're certainly not one of the big big contracts 
[02:30:00]  that they would be looking at at first seven point two cents right now what do you do do you fool  with it do you dabble in it a little bit guys just told me you got out i got out at eight  now it's a seven two i go do you gotta go penny to penny with this one my friend you want me to  dabble yeah go a little dabble no i wanted to go a little lower dude i want to get it's got to go  into the sixes is that that's that pregnant woman that had 80 babies uh holy shit look at the stretch 
[02:30:30]  marks on her side that looks just like the way that pregnant woman's belly looked in uh dawn of the  dead before that uh i'm sure zombie baby came out tmz's got the picture but they're showing it on tv  right now it looks like she has a is it a hoppity hop yeah hippity hop or whatever in in the front  there they're showing her with like a she she looks really good right there no she doesn't i would  would you danny no right there that just looking at the face she doesn't look like she used to have 
[02:31:00]  a cleft palate yeah yeah she looks like one of those cleft palate kids that got fixed or something i  don't like the whole duck collagen lip thing i know i'm not digging that she does have heath ledger  lips but and what is she well she's a whore espanol she's not even a whore she got some  espanol in her she likes uh the turkey baby she have a nose job too yeah it looks like she's done  plastic surgery i think one of the babies fell out of it go to tmz.com though the picture is amazing

[03:34:30]  with the ultimate retard face as a guy is wheeled underneath her with a trach fucking  a respirator trying to eat her pussy people he could eat her pussy though and not even have  to come up for air it'll just keep pumping right he should have tried to eat it with the hole in his  neck yeah wow they are really uh into each other oh my god i don't know what's more disturbing that 
[03:35:00]  the fact that there are pictures of this or the fact that someone took the picture yeah someone's  like like they had to ask somebody they're all in cahoots together they both have the respirators so  they can't breathe on their own and uh where's his balls yeah they're gone right yeah i think they're  gone they used to he lost them somewhere i forgot to put this up for the audience i'm sure they're  going to want to see what and what was the site called oh this is up on uh inhumanity inhumanity 
[03:35:30]  that pretty much explains it you can find that off the e-fucked it  it's on it's on the e-fucked network network right e-f-u-k-t wow  where you go they're laughing pretty good look at her face that's extreme pleasure  or she just went into cardiac arrest she's got a little terry schivo going on yeah  his balls are gone and look at her fingernails yeah they look like pacinos in that movie 
[03:36:00]  oh god what a mess these two are they made for each other though  there is no god it's a penis yeah all right let's get out of here no testes we find uh the  wheelchair fred thing yet thumbs up are we gonna go right into it now  yeah let's get all right this is when wheelchair fred called our show  an old uh friend of the show yeah he's a mess from a motorcycle accident actually because his voice 
[03:36:30]  is really fucked up and he's he's mangled pretty good but he's all there up top yeah he's still got  his uh mind but he can't really speak very well he had his trachea like crushed or some  shit and then he got his legs busted in so many places he's in a wheelchair right he's not paralyzed  right but he just can't walk so he's still got health insurance and his dick and everything  so if he had real health insurance he probably wouldn't have been as mangled he was a he was a  cool motorcycle dude and uh and now he's stuck fucking himself uh with a dildo in his own bathtub 
[03:37:00]  check this out we'll see you guys tomorrow thanks for listening thanks to the crowd and  everything all right bye bye i'm sure people might not want to go with what i'm about to say  an idea uh-huh okay you can either go with it or turn the channel all right now fred you say you're  real desperate and uh life blows and yeah and uh you can't get a woman out there and you and uh you  you don't want guys anymore yeah and i must be ugly and and you're stuck with the dildo right 
[03:37:30]  you guys i really think you need to show people out there your plight and how desperate you really  are and what you have to do to get satisfaction and i think that might help your life how would he do  that but don't you know i was thinking there's more snow around here i haven't been out he hasn't 
[03:38:00]  been outside in a while because there's a lot of snow in the area for a month i'm thinking you know  he might want to give us a little demonstration today no  because i honestly don't think i honestly don't think people understand how desperate fred is jim i  do think that if you show that desperation a little bit you'd be much more likely to get some emails from  some girls who are willing to strap one on and give it to you yeah because at this point i think 
[03:38:30]  after the demonstration i'm just thinking yeah that uh people are gonna feel sorry for you and  there's gonna be a few women out there that are gonna feel sorry for you and i think they're  gonna start emailing you think this is a surefire way for him to get girls short thing you want  you want you want you want girls right friend get pity what i'll get pity you'll get pity but i think  you'll get it i think you'll get girls emailing you it's kind of like the girls that write prisoners  and stuff they're out there fred i'm telling you but i don't think they understand how sad and 
[03:39:00]  desperate you are so i think a little demonstration would really really yeah i was looking  you do fred you want to get ready and uh oh what do you think fred i think i'll go and buy a hooker  you think you'll go and buy a hooker no you don't make much money you're not you're not you're not  i think you're missing the point yeah i think fred's missing uh the point here fred are you at your  place right now yeah you're at your place you have your home ah shut up uh you have your your dildo with
