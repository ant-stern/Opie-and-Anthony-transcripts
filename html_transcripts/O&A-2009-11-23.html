<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast detailed here was a highly sexually explicit and offensive program featuring a variety of segments and guests.  The show began with Primetime Sam Roberts and E-Rock hosting a segment on sex addiction.  In-studio guests Jim Norton, Rich Vos, and Bob Kelly discussed their own experiences with graphic detail, using vulgar language and describing various sexual acts.  Callers Wendy, a sex-addicted trucker, and Jeff, who frequented prostitutes, contributed their own explicit accounts, with Wendy’s past, including potential childhood abuse, briefly touched upon.  The segment was punctuated by numerous crude jokes and interruptions, including a running gag involving a picture of Pete Rose.

The show continued with Opie and Anthony joining Norton and Vos in a highly sexually explicit conversation detailing their own sexual encounters, including mutual masturbation, oral sex in various public places, and encounters with women described using derogatory terms.  Norton recounted a particularly graphic anecdote, and Vos shared multiple stories involving encounters with multiple women simultaneously.  A prank involving porn star Lisa Sparks and a naïve intern, David, was then executed, resulting in David inadvertently touching Lisa’s breasts under the hosts’ direction.

A subsequent segment featured a woman, Lisa, in the studio, with a male guest, David, instructed by the hosts to engage in increasingly intimate physical contact with her, culminating in touching her breasts and genitals.  The situation escalated when Lisa’s (staged) husband arrived, angry at David's actions. A near physical altercation was averted by the intervention of the hosts and others.  The "husband," revealed to be a long-time listener, then joined in a discussion which included the use of racial slurs.  This segment also included a preview of an upcoming segment involving Eastside Dave and a forced head shaving.


The show then shifted to a chaotic segment revolving around a dispute between Opie and Eastside Dave (“Afro Wars”), stemming from a haircutting incident that left Dave nearly bald. This was interwoven with a weight-gain contest (“Biggest Gainer”) involving Opie, Anthony's staff, and Dave.  Dave’s lost wedding ring and various health issues, including genital hives and prescribed medication (Veltrix), were discussed. The segment included graphic details of Dave's experiences on the Opie & Anthony TV show pilot, such as drinking a cup of Big A's shaved eyebrows, receiving a nipple piercing, and having apples spat into his mouth.  The potential for a Prince Albert piercing was also discussed. The "Biggest Gainer" contest concluded in a stalemate.  The segment also included numerous insults and offensive language.

An interview with Larry Sinclair, who claimed to have had sexual relations and used drugs with Barack Obama, followed. The interview was highly detailed and included questions about the specifics of the alleged encounter, Sinclair's health issues, and financial situation. The hosts expressed disbelief and used insults and offensive language throughout.

Later, Tom Jones was interviewed in the studio.  The conversation covered his career, interactions with fans, and past encounters with Elvis Presley.  A humorous moment arose from Tom Jones' prior acquaintance with Sinclair’s father, Joe Voss. Sexually charged remarks punctuated the interview.

Finally,  following Tom Jones' interview, a discussion with Patrice O'Neal and Louis C.K. focused on racial preferences in pornography, using explicit descriptions, racial slurs, and offensive language.  Specific websites and graphic details of their content were discussed. The conversation explored the reasons behind the preferences and touched upon racial prejudice, with frequent interruptions and tangents.  Numerous individuals were mentioned by name throughout the broadcast, including Gras, Pitsy, Mooch, Pepper, Kenny, E-Rock, Butcher, Jimmy Norton, and Steve.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, it's Jimmy Fallon, this is the worst of Opie and Anthony, which really means Opie  and Anthony went on paid vacations and these two had to work and be fired.  Here's Primetime Sam Roberts and E-Rock, and oh yeah, what's Late Night with Jimmy Fallon  on NBC?  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show, I am E-Rock, and this is Primetime Sam Roberts.  Both characters from the Opie and Anthony show that you know and love.  E-Rock, Dr. Drew's sexual rehabilitation show was not the first time the public knew about  sex addicts.  No? 
[00:00:30]  As a matter of fact, the Opie and Anthony show, that's the show that exposed sex addicts  to the public conscious.  Well, we know a lot of sex addicts.  It seems like most comedians that come by here are sex addicts.  Jim Norton comes to mind.  Bob Kelly.  Rich Voss.  Luckily, all three were in studio talking about that sexual addiction.  Oh, this is very convenient.  That's right.  Here it is.  Jim Norton, Rich Voss, and Bob Kelly talk about their sexual addiction.  It's much funnier than Dr. Drew's show.  Right here on the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  You're ready to be fucked, man. 
[00:01:00]  You're listening to the worst.  The worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  I want to talk about sex.  Let's talk about that sex thing.  Which sex thing?  Jimmy's little problem.  Yeah, because that's a fucked up thing.  I mean, we got people in the room that are married, and then we have some people that are  getting married, and then we have somebody who's probably never going to be married, who  gets to fuck his life away if he chooses to.  I'm going to get married someday.  No, you're not, Jimmy.  That's got to be the worst addiction, though, man. 
[00:01:30]  A sex addiction.  Because you've got to have it.  Because you've got to have the sex.  How do you fucking cure that?  You just got to stop doing certain unhealthy things, like fucking the masturbation.  But then how do you get to the point that you're having healthy sex?  Yeah, but it's also a disconnection.  You're disconnected from something.  Is there a cure for sex addiction?  I really don't know.  Do people get through it?  Well, it's like food addictions.  I mean, you do it, but you just do it healthy.  That's all.  And you just know.  When something's healthy, when you're having healthy sex, it's okay. 
[00:02:00]  You just know it.  And the difference is if I'm jerking off on a line and my dick's not even hard, and I'm  coming for the third time of the day, you're at the wrong website.  It must be the comfortable chairs in here.  I know.  Plus, it feels a lot more comfortable over here.  Yeah, but you know what's weird is that there's guys that meet girls, they like them, and you  talk to them, how's your sex life?  Oh, yeah, we fuck like once a day or at least four times a week.  And I'm like, you fuck the same? 
[00:02:30]  It's like, wow.  And you like her?  It turns you on?  Like, I told my girl, I'm sorry, but you don't, it's like, honey, she gets mad because  she wants to come out in lingerie and be sexy, and she wants my dick to get hard.  It's like, you have to, if you want my dick hard and you want to fuck, you have to come  over and grab my dick and fuck with it.  It doesn't just stand up on fucking end like a fucking new 18-year-old in fucking Cleveland.  You know what I mean?  It's, it's, you need to come over and, it's like an old dog, you rub its belly and fucking 
[00:03:00]  jerk it off a little bit and I'll get hard and we'll be able to fuck, but, and these  guys who fuck their, I know friends of mine who have girlfriends and fuck them.  And it's like, wow.  But all the time, like, but they're really into fucking their chick.  Yeah.  And it's like, there's something about sex that is fucked up to me.  Why aren't you into fucking your chick?  It's not that I'm not into fucking my chick, it's that I'm disconnected.  Sex is a bad thing.  Sex was a, I was taught sex in a fucked up way. 
[00:03:30]  So it's, it represents bad to me.  So if I'm with somebody that I give a shit about it, I don't want to do bad shit to that  person.  I don't want to do shit, bad shit to her.  I want to do, I don't mind doing bad shit to some chick I meet in New Brunswick that, you  know, fuck her.  I don't give a shit.  Like some, some chick that just wants to suck my cock.  Fantastic.  My dick just goes, wah.  I can't even fucking not have a hard on around her.  But somebody who give a shit about it, it's like, it's like, fuck, this is bad.  This is fucking bad.  How the fuck do you get over that? 
[00:04:00]  I don't know.  You, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you have to go back  and find out those things that happened that made it, exactly, that made it bad.  But you also stop acting out.  Like, um, like if you stop acting out, like my dick has been all over the place lately because  I'm not, I mean, occasionally I am jerking off, but not nearly like what I was.  I would literally go home after the show.  I would try to nap and I couldn't nap because I would jerk off and I wouldn't stop jerking  off until it was fucking, like I would force myself to go to the gym and then fucking,  and then, uh, work out and go do my spot and then, you know, jerk off again at night. 
[00:04:30]  It was awful, dude.  Don't you?  Awful.  I jerk, in hotels on the road, I have to jerk off every day, but it doesn't take, you know,  but it's different, if you're jerking off healthy, like if you just scrap a load, you  throw some lube on your dick and you're fucking pumping out all over yourself and take a nap.  Yeah, exactly.  That's fine.  But if you're on Craigslist for three hours, hunting down she-mails, not that I do that.  No, me neither, but I mean, you know, if you're a fucking she-mail, you know.  And you get pre-cum coming out for the whole three hours. 
[00:05:00]  It's called edging.  Yeah, and then you, and then as soon as you find one and you just, just shoot it and it  comes out and you feel nothing.  Why don't you make yourself almost cum?  Why don't you just jerk it off really fast and maybe you can move on with other activities  for that day?  Believe me, right now that was Jim Norton in the mirror a thousand times.  I would love to know why I don't.  But what is that about?  It's escape.  It's numbing feelings.  My therapist told me it's to numb your feelings.  When you jerk off in the mirror, that's a sign of split personality.  Shut the fuck up.  It is a sign of split personality if you jerk off in the fucking mirror. 
[00:05:30]  That's creepy.  Maybe you just like looking at yourself jerking off.  Listen to me, I'm not a fucking doctor, but I know.  Really?  You're not talking boss?  Really?  Wow.  It is something.  You're not even a fucking high school student.  You're barely human.  It is something about, you don't feel, and it sounds gay, but you have to learn how to  feel something.  It's actually because you don't want to, because you grow up with so much fucking pain with whatever 
[00:06:00]  is happening that you learn how to do things that make you not feel pain.  I've jacked, though, to fucking websites and shit like that, and spent a long time doing  it.  You know?  You wait, you get right to the brink and stop.  Yeah, but do you pay for whores?  Because it fucking feels good.  There's no deep, dark fucking secret there.  For some people, it is.  That's what these guys are getting at.  That's what I'm saying.  A guy like you is a fucking amazing to me, because you're connected in a fucking different  way.  You can jack off and then go fucking pay your bills and fucking do shit. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, but also, and then you can go drink and buy guns.  So you have the same thing.  But you have, you fan it out.  Okay?  I don't drink anymore.  I don't do drugs anymore.  I did quit smoking.  My eating is not bad, so it all fucking comes out through my hand, my nipples, and my dick.  All of it.  All of that self-hatred.  All that big thing just dumps out that way.  Dumps out your cock.  Yeah, all that need to escape.  Comes out your dick hole.  If I was eating cake until fucking three in the morning, or drinking again, it wouldn't 
[00:07:00]  be as bad.  Then you'd be Bobby Kelly.  Well, you know what?  No, honest to God, though.  I mean, food is just like sex.  Because you're on the fucking road, and you don't want to get a whore.  You don't want to fucking go to a massage parlor.  You don't want to let some chick with fucking warts come into your fucking room and dry fucking  boner.  So you're like, fuck it.  You get a pizza, and it actually, you disconnect.  It's gratification.  It's that quick fix.  It's the same with comedy.  It's not feeling.  You don't want to feel.  It's not that you don't want to feel. 
[00:07:30]  You want to feel.  You want to feel quickly, and you want to rush.  No, it's that you don't want to feel anything.  I was just laughing at the boss finger pretzels.  Don't bite your finger.  Get it?  They're real small.  He just has mustard on his fingernail.  Yeah.  Jimmy, what are you doing?  We're having a serious discussion about your problems.  He's going to make a hand.  He's going to make Voss's hand out of the pretzels.  Here's the thing. 
[00:08:00]  Fucking visual jokes on the radio.  Here's the thing.  Well, what I'm saying about my...  He just did a chin joke.  You're going to look like Voss's hand.  Yes, of course.  Very funny, Jimmy.  So, Jimmy, where's this going to go?  I don't know.  I hope that I can stay away from it.  Let me swallow my pretzel because it's fucking making my life miserable.  Is it?  Awful.  It looks like it's making it miserable, though, not doing it.  No. 
[00:08:30]  No?  Can't you change your practices?  Well, yeah.  Like Ope said, you know, just jack off and shoot and then go about your business.  But, yeah.  But I wasn't even jerking off when I was horny.  I was just jerking off because...  Yeah, but...  It was something.  That's the thing.  If you're horny and you're like, fuck, I want to scrap a load.  That's healthy.  Yeah, you scrap a load.  No one cares.  I'm not saying I wouldn't do that, but I don't know how to do that.  Like, what I do is I wind up on Craigslist.  Just look at it ads.  Or I wind up on one of eight websites and it's fucking hours and it's fucking endless. 
[00:09:00]  Well, like Ope said, just fucking jack off.  Yeah, but it sounds like...  It sounds like there's like an OCD thing happening there, too.  I know what you mean, but no.  I mean, maybe that's...  It's because it's like you're...  It's like there's a tick.  It is about escape.  And Bobby's right.  So it is about feeling nothing and numbing yourself.  And it is a quick fix in the sense that you're getting a rush.  It's that endorphin release.  It's like a drug.  It's like...  And let's be honest.  When a guy comes, there's a major disappointment right after you come.  It's like you go from a really cool high to poof. 
[00:09:30]  Let me tell you something.  You're just crashing hard.  You've got to help them with our homework.  Jerking off is like a big hug.  It's like a hug from the dad you never had.  It's just gone.  A fucking lonely hug of...  Well, it was the same as when you used to...  Women jump up and start doing chores and they're just happy after and stuff.  And guys, there's a massive crash that happens.  But we're brought up on sex in a fucked up...  We're brought up with porn and magazines and fuck, fuck.  Fuck this bitch.  I fucked that bitch.  Women are brought up the opposite spectrum. 
[00:10:00]  It's like find somebody you love and fucking romance and blah, blah, blah.  And you don't want to fuck.  We're brought up.  Fuck that bitch.  You fucked that bitch.  I fucked that.  I mean...  So we're brought up in a fucked up way.  It's just...  And it sucks for us.  My wife was brought up like a dude.  Well, that's because there had to be a balance made or else nothing would get done in this world.  We'd all just be fucking.  Or if it was the other way around, human beings wouldn't exist. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, but then there's a point...  There's a point in life that when you meet a chick you like and all of a sudden you're supposed to be like them.  You're supposed to...  Hey, let's make love.  You know, fuck what?  What?  Let's say hi to Wendy the trucker.  She's a sex addict.  I think we should take some sex addicts.  Oh, I love to.  But sex addict calls today.  Yes, Wendy.  Wendy.  Hi.  Hey.  I just wanted to say that I totally understand how Jimmy feels.  I'm a sex addict and I've gone to therapy. 
[00:11:00]  Wendy, can I stop you for a second?  I've got to be honest.  I'm not even trying to be a radio dick guy.  You know, when a girl says she's a sex addict, it's kind of hot.  I don't mean to be a dick, but...  What kind of...  How did you act out?  Um, it's more like the, the hunt.  Um, I kind of like married men are a lot easier to get, but it's just the thrill of the hunt.  Thank you.  Once you get them and have sex, then you don't want them anymore.  Yep.  Huh, so how many, how many guys you're fucking? 
[00:11:30]  Huh?  How many guys were you fucking?  Um, I, it's probably in the hundreds.  Wow.  I've been, I've been married and it's been hard being married because sex gets really boring  when you're with that person once you have them.  Um, I have to masturbate like every night before I go to bed, a couple of times sometimes.  Are you still married?  No.  What's the most guys you've had in like a weekend?  In a weekend?  Yeah. 
[00:12:00]  Um, probably like four, four or five.  Four guys in one weekend, four or five?  It's easy on the road because, you know, I have my choice of men.  Are you pretty?  Are you good looking?  Yeah.  Um, for the trucking world, yeah.  So a lot of black men.  Oh yeah, I'll do a black man.  Yeah.  You ever gang bang?  Um, no, just two guys.  Two guys.  Tag teaming.  Jesus.  A little put you on the rotisserie deal.  Two brothers. 
[00:12:30]  Been to the, I've tried the like swinger parties.  Um, those are all right.  Yeah.  The women get a little jealous there, so you have to go to predominantly male ones, but,  um.  You pick them up at rest areas?  You gotta have the thrill.  Do you park your Peterbilt in your cunt?  Jesus.  Anthony, Anthony's interviews.  I wish Dr. Phil did his, his, uh.  So how many guys you fuck?  Yeah.  It's kind of like the, uh, story, you know?  Are you scared of catching something? 
[00:13:00]  Fucking fuck.  Jesus.  I, I use protection.  All right.  And I'll pick, I mean, I'm not just gonna pick any, uh, fat trucker there and have sex  with them.  Right.  Yeah.  What do you, like, like, do you like giving head?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  So, like, you would just be at a truck stop and decide you want to suck some cock?  Yeah.  Wow.  That's pretty cool.  And I, I have my little thing.  I get to the truck stop.  I go in, take my shower, put on nice clothes, you know, uh, do my hair and makeup and I  find the guy, I pick out the guy that I want to have sex with. 
[00:13:30]  How do you find him?  How do you pick him out?  Um, there's just a connection.  You just know.  And what about the approach?  What about, what about the approach?  You walk up to him.  What do you do?  Um, I just find something to talk about.  I give, I give him a look.  I've been told I have, uh, I just have this look that I want to be fucked in my eyes.  But yet, I'm very kind of.  I have Patrice do a gig a week before you get there.  Thank you.  Hey, uh, Wendy, do you have a MySpace that we can look at? 
[00:14:00]  I do.  Do you want to give it out?  You'll get, you'll get.  It's, uh, trucker sticks.  69.  Of course, 69.  69.  You know what that means.  Where are you as far as, uh, trying to take care of this?  As far as what?  Where are you?  Like, are you still, are you getting help?  Or are you just, what are you doing?  Um.  Still just fucking?  Well, I'm in a new relationship.  I tried the therapy once.  The guy I was with thought I was just full of it.  And, um, so I gave up on it. 
[00:14:30]  And now I'm just trying with self-control.  All right, hold on a minute.  We got, uh, Bob the trucker.  Bob, what's up?  Yeah, this is Bob the trucker.  Uh, I'm just wondering when he's going to be tonight.  At a buffet.  Well, we might have seen a picture.  Wait a minute.  Is that, is that you?  All she has to do is let me know and I'll meet her there.  I'll tell you where she's going to be.  Hoping Danny DeVito and Billy Crystal don't throw off her train.  Was that her?  All right, where is, let's see a picture of Wendy. 
[00:15:00]  Is that the only one we got?  Oh, she's not bad.  Is that you, uh, taking your own picture with a cell phone in a mirror?  Um, no, I don't think there's any of those on there.  Oh, wait.  How do we find a picture of you then?  We're on your MySpace.  It's trucker, T-R-U-C-K-E-R-C-H-I-C.  Trucker Chick, 69.  Trucker Sheik.  Oh, good.  That wasn't you.  Thank God that wasn't you.  All right, yeah, we just saw a slob of a person. 
[00:15:30]  Prisoner of the highway.  Are you sure that's not you?  Prisoner of the highway?  All right, here's, uh, is that you?  Uh, wait, wait, there might be some, uh, MySpace, uh, fraud going on there.  Yeah, I know, you gotta hold up a newspaper with a date on it.  You're only showing your eyes.  That's never a good sign when you, uh, have that on MySpace.  Those are her fuck-me eyes.  Let me see.  Uh, this girl, this one much better than the MySpace page we just had on.  What she's not saying?  Wow.  If you, if you find my space in MyPitchers, there's a couple pictures in there. 
[00:16:00]  I have to kind of keep it clean for my kids.  You're not, you're not bad from the forehead up.  Jesus Christ.  You got them big tits?  Honestly, she's not that bad.  She's not bad.  I mean, for a truck stop, no job.  How shallow were we?  She calls up about her addiction, and we're like, how big are your tits?  Not, not bad.  Yeah, she's trying to share with us.  I know, she's.  We're trying to do something a little different today, and we failed again.  What are we doing that's different?  And Bob's stupid, Voss is stupid, and I can't stop eating on the air.  Sounds like everything's from October 2004. 
[00:16:30]  You're a little chubby, but I'd fuck you.  Nice.  I am.  I'm chubby, but, you know, like I said, I'm here in the trucking world.  I'm not bad.  You definitely got, maybe just cut out two blowjobs a week and go work out.  You definitely got the fuck me eyes, that's for sure.  You use those eyes, I think you're getting whatever you want, so.  Yeah, that's what I've been told.  Why don't you make extra money at the truck stops and just get paid for blowing a couple truckers if you like doing it?  Because it can't be that easy.  Hey, can I ask you a question?  There's got to be some game to it, you know? 
[00:17:00]  Don't make him hide the money.  Bob Kelly wants to ask us something.  I just want to ask you a question.  Do you just, do you like, like if you meet a guy where you just suck his cock?  Yeah.  Like you don't have to fuck him, you just meet a guy and just suck it?  Um, I met this one guy, we were getting our trucks loaded and it was like instant connection  and we were in my truck and I was done blowing him within 10 minutes.  From meeting to swallowing cum in 10 minutes. 
[00:17:30]  Yep.  You let a guy fuck you in the mouth, cutting ass?  Yeah.  Wow.  And you'll swallow the load?  Yeah.  That's good protection.  What are you protecting it from?  Sometimes it just happens.  Wendy, where did this come from, you think?  Oh, probably the typical, uh, abuse of the child.  Oh boy.  Sex abuse?  What happened?  From who?  You know, the father thing and older guy things.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Slow down, Wendy. 
[00:18:00]  Slow down.  The father, you had sex with your father?  Um, no, no, I don't think so.  He, uh, he molested my sister.  Oh boy.  What did he do to her?  And I was pretty young, so I don't remember if anything happened with her.  Were you jealous of that?  Molested her.  How did, how did he molest her?  Yeah.  Um, I really don't know.  She was older than me.  I was the, uh, trying to save the marriage baby, so my parents divorced when I was young.  Oh.  Did you say did your dad touch?  And then we ended up on the carnival.  Did your dad, I'm sorry, did your dad make you, make you touch his weenie? 
[00:18:30]  I don't remember.  Oh boy.  You're blocking it out, you think?  Huh?  Uh, Brian H. wants to know if you're in Maine, because he'll fuck you right now.  In Maine?  Yeah, what part of the country are you in?  I know I'm in Arkansas.  Arkansas, okay.  So, so if I, if I went, if I saw you at a truck stop and I was, I just looked at you  and I go, I just want you to suck my cock, would you do it?  Um, it depends if there was that connection.  Like you go, I cocked to your mouth?  You just walk up and go like, hey, how you doing? 
[00:19:00]  And, uh, you know, what are you hauling?  Blah, blah, blah.  Truck talk.  And then you go, like, uh, hey, why don't you come into my, uh, into my sleeper?  Hold on, hold on, we might have a guy that, uh, actually, uh, got blown by her.  Uh, Dano.  Hey guys, what's up?  What's up?  We got Wendy the sex addict trucker on the other line.  Yeah, that was Evansville, Indiana?  Nope.  No?  Ah, okay, sorry guys.  It's like a new game show on the over the day show. 
[00:19:30]  Did you fuck her?  Where did you get blown?  Sometimes I don't even know their name.  Like one guy that I've seen a couple times, I don't remember his name, but I just call him my happy meal guy.  Oh.  Because we met at McDonald's.  Oh, okay.  I thought maybe he gave you some, uh, happy meal.  Let me, uh.  She just knows him as.  Oh.  Let's get Johnny from Pennsylvania on the line.  Johnny.  Hey, what's up, bubba boys?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Uh, Wendy.  Hey, why don't you rub one out for us? 
[00:20:00]  I've been on the road since you're so hot, huh?  Yeah, Wendy, would you masturbate for everybody?  Um, I can.  I'm driving.  And I do have a boyfriend who's in the sleeper, so.  Oh, is he?  Do me a favor.  She can't have tabs on you.  Unzip it.  Unzip his pants and take out his cock while he's sleeping.  Yeah, why don't you, like, pull over and, uh, blow him?  Why don't you take out his cock?  Huh?  Take out his cock right now while you're driving.  Take out his cock, a sucker.  I've done that before, you know, I've had to pull over because he'll come up, he'll walk  up and have a hard on and I'll have to give him an edge. 
[00:20:30]  Wow.  It's actually people who try to talk dirty, but they're always congested.  Take out his cock and pull your mouth.  Yeah.  Hey, does he know you're a sex addict?  Huh?  Does he know you're a sex addict?  Yeah, he's, he's finding that out.  I've told him and, uh, when I don't get it for a while, I get really bitchy.  Does he get a big, does he get a big piece?  No.  No, what's he got, like six inches?  Yeah.  Six inches is pretty big.  And you've probably, you've probably been with guys with huge cocks, right? 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  You like a bigger cock?  Yeah.  Do you like a cock when you, when you take it out of your mouth, you have to make that  sound?  Do what?  It's so, it's so big when you take it out, you just, that's not, you have to, that sound?  Vacuum seals around our lips.  The other thing you said, I, I did catch, uh, you said you were raised in a carnival?  Yeah.  Circus.  What?  What was that all about?  Um, when my mom divorced my dad, she decided she wanted to go travel on the carnival, so 
[00:21:30]  we did that for, and how old were you?  Did people pay a quarter to see you under a tent?  Yeah.  How old were you?  The magnificent sword swallower.  How old were you, Wendy?  I'm just helping your, I was, um, 10.  Oh, okay, you definitely got fucking touched at the carnival.  Bobby, what's wrong?  What happened?  We're in the middle of talking to Wendy, the sex addict.  Fucking, just his rotten calamari ass. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, it just looks like a squid mouth.  He should have a beak coming out of his asshole.  All right.  A little sea urchin ass.  Yeah, he should shoot black dye from his asshole when he gets scared.  Well, Wendy, thanks for calling the show.  Wow, Wendy.  So, Wendy, how long have you been, how long have you been, you know, not, how long has  this, you've been not fucking?  Um, I met this guy in September, so I've been with one guy since September. 
[00:22:30]  You haven't fucked anybody since September?  Come on.  Just him.  Is it hard?  Yes.  His cock hard, right now it's hard, his cock?  Um.  Do you eat his asshole?  Not yet.  Why not?  He's letting me experiment.  Did you ever get a big asshole pube with a root on it, still on it, stuck in your teeth?  Fuck you, you know what, leave you?  I told him he's got to clean up the apple a little bit, you know.  He's got to clean it up there. 
[00:23:00]  Jesus.  A root.  That's great.  It looks like a scallion.  That is disgusting.  Have you ever, have you ever.  You know, you have to know, right?  Have you ever came, have you ever had an orgasm by sucking somebody else's, by sucking a dick?  Like, hold on.  Wait, hold on.  I, I, I stopped.  Please, can I just say something? 
[00:23:30]  What the fuck was that about?  Never put me in the same category as stupid.  What the fuck was that about?  By sucking a dick, that's what I meant.  Ah, this fucking guy's sucking me.  What was that about?  Jesus Christ.  Whoops, whoopsie.  What the fuck?  Jesus Christ.  What was that about?  I, I meant to say, have you, she ever had an orgasm?  I meant to say, we also know what you did say.  Oh my God.  Jesus.  Jesus Christ.  Whoopsie.  Whoopsie. 
[00:24:00]  What did I say?  By sucking somebody else's dick by accident.  Wow.  Wow.  Have you ever had an orgasm by giving somebody a head?  That's too late now.  I guess Voss had an incident where he sucked some guy's cock.  He wants to know if you can relate to that.  By rubbing on the guy's leg like a shih tzu.  And he just wants to know if you can relate to that.  Were you so horned up like Voss was when he was sucking another man's cock?  He just shot his load out of his daisy dukes. 
[00:24:30]  Like she's.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, thank you, Wendy.  We're going to let you go.  It's time for leaks.  We'll, uh.  Yeah, I got to pee.  Oh God, that's not funny.  We'll talk to you next time.  We got a few more people that are sex addicts on the line.  And we'll talk to them next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, this is Robert Kelly.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  The worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony with Sam and E-Rox.  Sam, coming up after the break.  Sex addiction.  Voss, Bob Kelly, Norton. 
[00:25:00]  All talking about their sexual addictions.  All hilarious.  And all just mentally deranged.  Stay tuned.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  The virus.  You're listening to the worst.  The worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony with E-Rox and Primetime Sam Roberts.  Sam, we're continuing on with sex addiction featuring Jim Norton, Bob Kelly, and Rich Voss.  Who better to describe sexual addiction than these three addicts? 
[00:25:30]  They put down the drugs.  They pick up another addiction.  And that addiction is sex.  You think you've heard it all.  But that's nothing.  Here comes part two of Jim Norton, Rich Voss, and Bob Kelly, sexual addicts.  You're listening to the worst.  Holy shit.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Fuck it.  Oh, fuck it.  Yeah, that's your answer.  That's your answer to everything.  Lovely conversations during the break.  Talking about shitting.  Sucking cock. 
[00:26:00]  Sucking cock.  Trying to see if there's any truth to Rich's slip-up.  When Rich wants to know, in the last segment, he said he never sucked and he just held it in front of his mouth.  And maybe, I bet you he took it and then bounced it off his own lip like, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Yeah.  That's the sound it makes when you're about to service an older gentleman and you're trying to turn him on.  He just rubbed the tip just to get the pre-sem like Carmex on his lips. 
[00:26:30]  And just rubbed it around.  Do you ever do that?  All right, Rich, have you ever had your dick in another man's mouth?  Ew, when?  Let's say hi to Jeff the Trucker.  Jeff, what do you got?  Hold on, Jeff.  This is the sound it makes if you just bounce it off your pursed lips.  Fuck.  Jeff, what do you got for the show?  Help us out here.  It's like a smoke of a cigar.  How's it going, guys? 
[00:27:00]  Hey, no, when?  Go ahead, Jeff.  Yeah, you're on.  I was just saying, I just wanted to let you guys know, you know, I didn't have a fucked up childhood or nothing like that.  It was all good for me.  You know, my folks are great.  But, you know, I'm fucking horrible, man.  I look at fucking porn for hours.  And then I can't help myself.  I've got to go get some, you know?  And I'll get hooker after hooker.  And it's fucking rough. 
[00:27:30]  I can't help myself, you know?  I'm blasting potato flakes all over a meat pocket.  Why hookers?  They're easy to kid, you know?  But hook it.  Why not?  But you can't even kiss him.  Why not?  They're right there.  They're slutty, you know?  It's easy to do.  I'm a fat fuck, so, you know.  Oh, okay.  There you go.  Yeah, that's no big deal.  Hey, Bobby, when you have sex with your wife, do you kiss her?  I'm not fucking talking about that, you fucking cunt. 
[00:28:00]  What?  I'm just asking if you're talking about disconnecting and sex and stuff.  I think, I think, I think.  But this guy's talking about a whole, another thing, too, is that, I mean, you know, when  you have shitty self-esteem and you hate yourself, it's so easy.  You're not going to go to a bar and try to meet a chick.  You're going to go fucking, dude.  Jimmy just makes the face to me.  It's all about hating yourself, dude.  See, dude, if you hate yourself, you're going to wind up bad like you hate, dude. 
[00:28:30]  You know, this is the funniest thing is, I can't even, I can't even say anything.  I don't even have a fucking brain unless I go, dude, shut your face.  Dude.  Listen.  I was just saying that about the piece of shit.  I like how Jimmy made himself the smartest comic in the fucking room.  You're not.  You're not.  You do.  No, you're not.  You fucking, you fucking, you call me every time you have any glitch in your fucking electronic  life.  You call, dude.  I call a plumbing when there's shit in the vault.  I don't want to call a lot of people.  You call me.  And this asshole, this asshole will actually teach it back to you. 
[00:29:00]  This is, this, you're not the smartest comic in the room.  He teaches it back to you.  All right.  All right.  Go ahead.  Prove that you're smarter than Jimmy.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Prove that you're smarter than Jimmy.  What's a terabyte?  Hopefully something you get from drinking shitty ice cubes in Guatemala.  Shit.  Exactly.  I have terabytes.  I'm not saying that he's not funny.  He's hilarious.  I have terabytes.  And he's fast.  I have terabytes on my computer.  It's a fucking hard drive space.  I know what terabyte is.  What?  For you.  I know.  But this is the fact, is that Jimmy, admit this. 
[00:29:30]  Whenever you put in a sandwich.  Don't say fuck.  That's a taradacto bite.  Oh, you fucking right.  You know what?  It was my, it was my smashing and I'm mad at you.  Oh, yeah.  First of all, I was asking you about your wife because I don't kiss as much.  And you were talking about disconnecting and the sex thing.  And that's why I asked you to kiss when you make love.  That's all.  It wasn't a personal thing.  Yeah, it is.  You were talking about my wife and kissing.  No, I'm talking about you.  How is it not personal?  Yeah, Boston.  Because you talked about sex with your wife.  How do you go from you sucking a cock? 
[00:30:00]  You just said, well, if I want my wife to get me hard, she just can't come in with a negligee.  She's got to pull my cock.  I always ask you a normal question about kissing and you're talking about fucking hand jobs.  He shot an elastic at Norton's ass and it caught it.  It just disappeared in Norton's ass.  A baby hand shot out.  Boston, do you kiss Bonnie when you're having sex?  Not that much.  That's what I'm saying.  Why?  Huh?  Why?  Because it's just kissing is, it shows too much affection. 
[00:30:30]  Do you kiss like when you're a girlfriend?  Are you like, will you, you make eye contact and kiss?  Yes.  I don't do that.  What's wrong with that?  I don't do that.  See, you're, exactly, you're, you're, you're one of those guys.  Yeah.  You're one of those guys.  Oh, look at this.  He's like a little romantic.  Who kisses?  No one kisses in love.  I'll kiss, yeah, but I'll kiss somebody but not a girlfriend.  Like, I'll kiss in that situation but not with a girlfriend.  You weren't kissing your girlfriend at the end?  You don't kiss hookers.  Sometimes, no, not when we're having sex.  Like a good, look at it.  Oh, no, she didn't want to kiss me either.  She wouldn't, she would close her eyes and pretend I was anyone but me. 
[00:31:00]  What would you do if you were fucking me?  Bonnie.  Rich, you and Bonnie.  When did you stop kissing her?  What's that?  Anthony, what happened?  What are you doing over there?  What happened?  Jimmy's, Jimmy's fart smells so fucking bad.  I don't smell it.  Dude, it didn't hit you.  It's pure shit.  It's fucking, it's evil.  It is evil incarnate.  It's like shit is coming out.  Oh, I'm fucking.  We didn't know what you were doing and we thought you were going to a bad place or something.  What the hell was happening with you? 
[00:31:30]  I was going to a bad place.  Stinkville.  All right, Rich.  Jesus.  When did you stop kissing Bonnie?  I mean, I kissed her once in a blue.  When you were, when you were first dating, I'm sure you were kissing like crazy, right?  I fucking, yeah, I used to kiss her.  I used to, yeah.  I think the kissing slows down a little bit, but.  Yeah, I think the kissing does because like, well, you know, I mean, it just, it's not.  So when you're having sex, you don't kiss her?  Don't look her in the eye?  What's going on?  No, well, something, no, not in the eye.  I try to, because I, no.  Back of the neck?  I just put my head to the side and, you know. 
[00:32:00]  And crud.  And just think about whatever I can to keep it hard.  Wait, do you say I love you while you're having sex?  Will you say like, I love you, babe?  Yeah.  Really?  See?  Not every time, but.  But you're looking right at her when you say it?  And she's looking back.  Why are you making me look like I'm a rock?  No, you're normal, but that's fucking a creep.  But see, you're not supposed to have.  Good for you.  You're supposed to have a fucked up background, too.  Well, you shouldn't be able to do all that good stuff.  My background isn't fucked up sex-wise.  My background's fucked up with like a mom and other things.  Yeah, but that's what distorts your sexual fucking, your. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, but you guys have like fucked up sex backgrounds.  But what's going to happen to you?  What's going to happen someday?  I mean, aren't you worried that someday she's going to want a, she's going to want a little,  you know, she's not going to want, you know, I love you, I love you, too.  She's going to want you fucking little pussy.  Get the fuck over here.  Not to, like, get too personal, but it's not all, you know, it's a variety.  We talk about this.  Relationships need lust and love.  You've got to understand that that whole lust thing has to be part of your relationship.  Are you a good dirty talker? 
[00:33:00]  I can't picture you talking dirty.  Do you get mean?  Do you get, like, too mean?  No, I don't get mean.  You like that?  I'm not over me myself.  You fucking idiot.  I'm not over me.  That's Anthony.  You just get way too mean.  You like that?  You fucking moron.  Fucking Jew lover.  You fucking, you dirty fucking kike.  Holy shit.  You fucking like that?  You like that?  Yeah?  Liberal?  You'd be surprised.  Can I ever tell you how much I hate your cunt, mother?  You'd be surprised.  Really?  Are you bad?  I'm very romantic. 
[00:33:30]  Are you really?  I'm a romantic.  What do you say?  Like, I love you, baby.  That feels so good.  Oh, that feels so good, baby.  That feels so good.  Like, like, uh...  That feels so good.  Yeah, I kind of give, like, a play-by-play, maybe, a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  That's it.  Put it in your mouth.  That's right.  Put it in your mouth like it's a fucking Smith & Wesson.  Right.  That's it.  Take your bullets all over your chin.  You're chipping her teeth with your desert eagle.  But he has to hand out name tags just to make sure he's...  He keeps it all organized.  Do you ever fantasize watching your wife thank somebody else? 
[00:34:00]  Oh, yeah.  I like you a lot.  Look down at her name tag.  Do you think that's interesting?  See, Anthony has a registration booth in his front fucking lobby.  Jesus.  Please sign in, please.  Yeah, stop at the help desk and then come back to the millionaire's cock.  Anthony's very private and holds his cards very close to his chest.  But this is what we're imagining, that there's a registration process.  So Voss asked a good question.  Voss asked a sick question.  I heard it.  What, Voss?  Do you fantasize, like, your wife or girlfriend banging somebody else? 
[00:34:30]  See, I can't go down that road.  Why would you fantasize about that?  That one bothers me.  Why?  Wouldn't you?  Why?  It's so wrong.  I told my chick that, of course.  But while her eyes were closed, just whatever the hell she was going, I was just pretending  that I was watching and there was, like, five guys teaching her a lesson.  Actually, I actually...  Not five, bud.  I keep my eyes shut because I don't want to see the guy's balls and assholes that she's  blowing while I'm fucking.  Well, I had this one girl and I fucked it up.  I can't believe I fucked this up.  I didn't even get to fuck her.  She blew me a couple of times. 
[00:35:00]  She goes, my fantasy is three guys in every orifice, you know?  Wait, three guys in every...  That's nine guys.  No, I mean, you know, one in each.  Nine guys.  All right.  Three talks in the police.  She's the guy in the Guinness Book smoking the cigarettes.  He is the smartest because he can multiply.  You know what I'm saying.  And I fucked it up with her.  But you got to be...  See, it's got to be, like, a real someone you're close with.  It can't be just some girl you're fucking...  It's got to be someone you're connected with.  I used to...  I fucked up a lot of relationships when I was younger because my thing was... 
[00:35:30]  And it was a fucked up...  I used to do it to test the chick.  Because I don't trust women.  I fucking hate...  I hate women.  Obviously.  So I used to get them...  I used to get them, like them, and then if I really liked them, I'd try to get them  to blow my friends.  I know that's fucked up.  What the hell is up with you guys?  Holy fuck.  And I would...  And you know what?  Ninety-five percent of them would blow my friends.  How would you get that done, though?  I would be like, okay, I knew it.  She's a fucking whore. 
[00:36:00]  Fuck you.  But how would...  But then...  Hold on, hold on.  You're jumping way ahead.  Like, how would you get her to blow your friends?  I'll tell you, you start fucking her, and then you start fantasizing, and you're  joking around, you see where they're at, and then you start making her tell you  if she could, would she, and they're usually like, no, no.  And then you get them to finally admit, like, yeah, I would.  And then they start getting into it, because they think it gets you off, so they'll  stop being like, yeah, I'd fucking suck his...  You like that?  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden, one night she shows up, and your friend is, hey, what's 
[00:36:30]  going on?  I just stopped by at two in the morning.  How are you guys doing?  And then, you know, you leave him alone for a second, and then you leave him alone,  and then she'll start, you know...  Do you let your friend in on this?  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  You tell him, look, this is the deal.  So, one time I did it, I said, you come over, I'm going to leave you alone, you start  talking, I'm going to come back in, we're going to go in the other room, I'm going to  get her to stop blowing me, then you walk in while she's blowing me, and she's going  to keep blowing me, and just take your cock out. 
[00:37:00]  Don't fucking, don't panic, just take your cock out.  And that's it.  Come over and take your cock out.  And then, they come on, take their cock out, and she, I'm telling you, it turns me on right  now.  Once the chick you're dating, and all of a sudden she looks over and sees another cock,  and then she just goes for it, you're like, oh God, ooh blee, ooh blee.  But you're going out with this girl.  Kind of.  Not in love, but you're going out with her, and then all of a sudden she blows him, and 
[00:37:30]  then, you know, it's kind of fucked up.  See, but it's like hostage, he's doing like hostage negotiations with his potential girls.  It backfired on me.  It backfired on me.  I mean, this one girl that I really liked, hot chick, and I tried to get her to do it,  and she kind of, she was kind of fantasizing.  This is so fucked up.  My friend was in the other room, and I opened the door to my room, and was fucking her doggy  style, halfway out the door.  You know what I mean?  And then she just was like, you know, I was like, yeah, you fucking sucky. 
[00:38:00]  What if he came right now?  What if he walked in here?  Would you grab his car?  And she was like, stop, stop.  This is bullshit.  She started crying, and then she left.  Oh, God, what a bad scene.  Yeah, she dumped me, too.  Did you end up blowing him?  Oh, shit.  Because he wanted a blowjob.  I know, I should have.  See, the problem is, the worst part is, is I was actually, at the time, living with six  retarded men.  I was their counselor.  Yeah, I've heard these stories.  I'm banging a chick in the hallway.  Don't repeat the story, because some guy's going to call up and say, here's the thing.  The fucking retarded mule comes out. 
[00:38:30]  The problem is, see, because you, Kim, it's drooling already.  Not him, you idiot.  Yeah, just fingers.  You can't use friends.  You've got to use fake people in those fantasies.  He takes his wig off and puts it on their head.  Hold it for me.  She wants a baseball sign because she thinks it's Pete Rose.  You didn't tell me you knew Pete Rose.  Boss, what do you have?  No, I'm just, it's, it's, it's, you can't use your real friends in a fantasy like that. 
[00:39:00]  It's got to be a complete unknown.  What are you out of your mind?  Why don't you use your friends?  How come his head and his neck just have, like, one line of things?  There's no face shape.  There's no lower face.  Holy shit.  It goes.  That stupid puzzled look.  She's sucking his dick.  That dumb fucking look on his face.  His hand starts opening close. 
[00:39:30]  Why does Pete Rose look so scared?  Why does Pete, why only one of his eyes opening?  Oh, God.  Why is Pete Rose's tongue so long?  Oh, fuck.  Oh, Bobby, Pete Rose is shitting on the floor.  Jesus.  He's constantly spirals out of control. 
[00:40:00]  It's fucking too funny.  Pete Rose did not touch my head.  He has jelly on his fingers.  Going back to Bobby's story.  Oh, God.  Sean brings up something that comes up a lot, Bobby.  And I'm just going to read this.  If you're in the same building, let alone the same room with a guy who's got his cock out,  that's fucking gay.  No, it's not.  No, it is.  Shut up.  A lot of guys who say that.  You fucking homophobic faggot.  You have such a...  Really? 
[00:40:30]  So what do you do?  Get on top and fuck her like a man?  Fuck you, you faggot.  Get a cock near your cock.  Stop being...  That's a man.  A man can get close to another guy's cock.  Calm down, Bobby.  You're gay.  Here's the thing.  If a guy blows you...  But it's coming in a lot.  If a guy blew me...  So what?  I'm just saying.  Listen to me, Zach.  Listen, a guy's never blown me, but if a guy blew me, wouldn't it make me gay?  It makes him gay.  Okay?  All right, Rich.  No, but I'm not saying...  Dude, I'm not saying you have to fucking suck a cock.  No, I didn't say I suck a cock. 
[00:41:00]  I'm saying...  A pussy needs to be in the room.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay, so if there's a pussy in the room and some guy blows you...  No, your dick needs to be in her mouth or a pussy.  I mean, you can't just have two cocks out and no pussy in the room.  Yeah, it's done it a million times.  Me and my friends have doubled so many fucking broads.  Beat Bobby.  And you should be having fun.  Bobby, why is Pete Rose wearing a hat with a propeller on his side?  I'm going to shit myself.  I'm fucking laughing so hard.  I can't look at Jimmy. 
[00:41:30]  I can't fucking look at him.  I hate that fucking guy.  Pete Rose.  I'm sorry.  Holy shit.  God damn, I'm crying.  What gets you more...  Fucking crying over here.  What gets you more excited?  What?  If you look at two girls eating...  If you're ready to jerk off, say you were looking at porn.  Fine.  Two girls eating pussy or a girl blowing a guy?  I like both.  What?  No.  That's not the question.  I don't...  There's no...  There's no...  What gets you more excited? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What do you...  Yeah.  I like...  I like...  I like Pete Rose sucking on a lollipop while he's getting head.  Oh, these guys are fucking...  Oh, shit.  I can't take it.  Holy fuck.  They went on fucking retard jokes.  There's like three shows going on at one time.  There really is.  It's fucking hilarious.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I couldn't look at Jimmy because he's laughing so fucking hard about Pete Rose that I start 
[00:42:30]  cracking up.  I'm crying.  I'm fucking tears coming out of my eyes from that fucking Jimmy, man.  Oh, funny.  All right.  This guy's going to back you up.  This does come up a lot, though.  Let's say hi to Will and Charlotte.  Will.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, it's hard to hear you.  So, listen, all these guys saying it's gay, if there's another guy in the room, they're  just basically not confident with themselves.  I got a friend of mine, him and his wife hang out with me and my chick. 
[00:43:00]  They get it on.  You know, we're fucking right next to each other.  It's not a big deal.  It's nothing.  You just...  You know, it's all about being confident with yourself.  These guys are...  They get a little timid of the penis.  Do you...  Does your wife and...  Does his wife and your girl fool around?  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah, definitely.  You know, we get them in the shower, you know, all that stuff.  And, you know, you go back and forth, whatever, but it's not gay just because there's another  penis in the room.  Do you bang his wife while he bangs your girlfriend? 
[00:43:30]  No, that's not.  Neither one of the chicks are cool with that.  It's not a full swap.  Oh.  What would you rather look at?  I will say, the first time it ever happened, I was fucking my chick, and he was fucking his  wife, and his hairy leg rubbed on mine, and I lost everything.  I don't know what I'd rather watch, though, because two chicks is almost too mild to me.  Yeah.  Like, I've seen that so many times.  Like, there's something dirtier about a chick blowing a guy.  Like, to me, that's more of a sex...  Because it's so acceptable. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  And I'm not saying two chicks doesn't turn me on.  It does.  But it's almost like that turned me on when I was 20.  Yeah.  Before time...  I'm not talking about porno, either.  I know.  Me, either.  Yeah.  Lesbian and porno don't turn me on as much as watching...  No, I'm not even talking porno.  No, I'm talking like you're at a party, let's say, and there's a bedroom, and there's two  chicks in bed.  That can be really hot.  On the bed, and you're fucking just watching.  That's hot.  That or a guy fucking a chick in a bed at a party or something.  What would you rather, like, peep in on?  Really hard to say. 
[00:44:30]  I honestly see.  It depends.  It's like, you know...  I'd much rather see the...  And it's not a homophobic thing, but I'd rather see the two girls going at it.  I might do it at times.  I'd rather watch the...  We asked you.  I've seen...  We saw a live sex show in Brazil, and it didn't fucking turn me on as much as...  I was in Albany.  I'm talking amateurs.  I saw two chicks eating each other's pussies was actually turned me on more live.  Live, watching two chicks eat each other's pussies was fucking...  I don't...  Watching it, it doesn't do anything for me.  Live, it fucking... 
[00:45:00]  I almost killed myself.  I used to have them just, like, you know, going around and kissing and shit.  Like, two girls in bed, totally naked, making out with each other and feeling each other  and stuff.  Not just two porn chicks, fucking 69, snatch eating.  I'm talking, like, some fucking heavy petting going on and shit.  Or gay porn.  That would be...  You ever watched gay porn?  What?  Jesus.  Fucking rich.  We were right at the fucking edge of hotness there.  Yeah, exactly.  It was, like, two chicks, fucking amateurs at a party.  They're fucking kissing. 
[00:45:30]  And you're like, I don't like gay porn.  Yeah.  No, Rich.  You like gay porn, Rich?  No, I mean, not anal.  But a little...  Anal's gross.  We...  That's gay.  Gay porn.  Gay porn.  Gay porn stinks.  It's funny.  I'll tell you why it sucks.  It stinks.  Gay guys...  There's two guys in it.  Guys, exactly.  If you watch fucking, like, a girl sucking a cock, she's actually performing.  She's licking it and looking and sucking.  Gay guys just blow each other to cum.  And they're just hammering it in his mouth and doing the exact technique that should be 
[00:46:00]  done to make somebody cum.  Girls are licking it, taking it out, sucking on a knot, making it sexy.  Yeah.  Gay guys are just like...  Look at Bobby's face.  Can I tell you the greatest sounds I've ever heard?  I got to have Kazaas somewhere, and I might still have it on an old hard drive.  It was...  There was two biker dudes, and one dude is shitting in the other dude's mouth.  But the sound is...  It's the fuck...  I have to get it for the radio, because the sound is like... 
[00:46:30]  Ah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  It was so...  It was like...  It was...  The one guy is sitting on the edge of something.  Get the fuck out of here.  And it's almost like the other guy's laying under him, and it was such a long coil shit.  It was like...  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  It's like...  It's the sounds of it.  It's all you'll want to hear in your replay machine.  Oh.  Oh.  Let's go to Mike in...  Jesus Christ.  Let's go to Mike in New York City.  Mike, what's up?  Wonderful. 
[00:47:00]  Mike, how are you doing?  Hey.  Yeah, I was the guy that called up a couple weeks ago with the orgy story with the bride.  The what story?  The orgy story with the bride could be...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, so as I'm telling all my friends, like, why wouldn't I?  There are all a bunch of people saying that I'm gay because I'm around my buddy because  his cock is out.  And I'm pretty much saying, all right, when you're watching porno, don't you see a cock  there?  All right, well, if you're lucky.  Easy boss.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's porno. 
[00:47:30]  A lot of guys would say it's gay.  A lot of guys say it's not.  It's not gay.  Me and my friends used to jerk off together.  That's gay.  That's gay.  That's not gay when you're just two guys in a room when you're young.  I talked about this on the radio before.  That's not gay.  How old were you?  Huh?  32?  No.  We were eight.  I don't know.  We were like 16 or 17.  I don't fucking know.  I was a little old.  Yeah.  It's a little old.  Really?  Yeah.  It's not experimenting anymore.  The only time me and Vos jerked off one time, but there was a girl in between us, and then  she got up for a second, and I'm laying on the bed, and there's like a girl's space 
[00:48:00]  in between us, and then she came back.  And Vos was so funny that day, because I think I told this story, but he goes, let's  up a coin.  Whoever loses has to fuck her.  And you said this in front of her.  That's the beauty of that.  And then he came first, of course, and there was cat shit in the bathroom, and he must have  smelled it when he walked in.  I'm trying to jerk off, and I hear.  Wait, wait.  Also, remember that time?  This is what I was hoping we were going to get to, by the way. 
[00:48:30]  The Rich Vos, Jim Norton sex stories.  Well, we got tons of sex stories.  But the one time.  We got tons of sex stories.  The one time, I was fucking.  Oh, God.  This hot girl, I met her outside the cellar.  She was like 20, and I'm driving.  We're going.  Norton's driving us back to wherever, my car.  Oh, yeah.  And she's blowing me in the back of the car, and all I can see is his beady eyes in the mirror,  right?  So we go back to his house, right?  And she's, and she don't really want, no one ever wants anything to do with him when  they're with me. 
[00:49:00]  You know what I mean?  So he was like, she's blowing me, and he's like, touching her.  He jacked off, right?  I swear to God, his load hit himself in the face.  I'm sitting next to him, and he's laying on the couch, and then we made her sign something  like, did you have a good time, remember?  Oh, my God.  I forgot about that.  Do you remember the time I almost made the girl puke with my asshole?  I also remember that.  Would you take your shirt off?  Hold on.  Why are you asking Jimmy if he remembers that? 
[00:49:30]  We were together.  We got this chick a long time ago, and we went back to his place, and he already did  his thing, so I got her, and I made her eat, I made her want her to eat my ass and blow  me, so, but I, there was, he was in the other room, I was in a hallway, so I just took my  pants off, and I still had my dirty, hot socks on, because we just did like three shows,  so I was just, my balls were all hot.  Sweaty and all.  And she was lying on the floor, and then she got up on her, I don't know, she had her fucking 
[00:50:00]  on her bum, and just started eating my ass out, and this was, all Jimmy heard from the  other room was, oh, and then, wait, wait, wait, wait, it went, oh, God, it was in the  hallway of my apartment, just like a fucking picture, I had, I had dust bunnies in my asshole.  Remember the four and the two I brought back to the hotel room?  Oh, the one was getting married with the bad teeth?  No, the four and the two? 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, one was a four, and then one was so fucking horrendous, and Jimmy, and  he's begging her.  One meter or two, that she had all her female parts?  It was, these were the ugliest I've ever met at Caroline's.  She had a blouse on from Marshall's?  And it was fucking horrific, and I called Norton, he was doing Dangerfields, and I was  at Caroline's, I got these two broads, and we go back to this fucking, they have a hotel  room at the fucking Marriott, and this girl's blowing me in the bathroom, and he's begging  the two, telling the two that he just got out of rehab or whatever. 
[00:51:00]  Was I?  Yeah, yeah, he would get lying, I was in rehab, I haven't been with a girl in a long  time, and she just, no.  You're working a four, that's awesome.  And then the four, the four blew me, was eating my ass out and stuff, and I talked her into  blowing Jimmy, right?  And then we're leaving, and I go, she blew you, he goes, yeah, I go, did you make out  with her?  He goes, just a little.  I go, well, she just ate my ass.  I was making out with her in the bathroom, and I didn't know she had eaten his ass. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, fuck.  It would have been better if you didn't give away the ass-eating in the setup.  Yeah.  You should have said she blew you.  Oh, shit.  I thought that's better.  That's all right, it's still effective.  That's still effective.  I just caught that, yeah.  It still leaves a bad taste in your mouth, either way, look at it.  I try to get a wait, we were on the road, and didn't I, like, fucking try to get a  waitress to go in a closet with you somewhere?  Yeah, just look at his cock, just look at his cock.  He's got a big dick, just look at his dick.  He's trying to get a waitress to go in a fucking closet.  I used to brag about his dick to other girls.  Trying to get them in the fucking bathroom with me. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, God damn.  I think that's why, like, I'm friends with all you guys, but I never have taken that  last step to be close friends with you guys, because I've seen enough, I've seen Jimmy's  cock, and you can't be a friend of Jimmy's until you've seen his cock.  I've watched Vos make out with a grandmother.  Me and Bobby don't really have, you know, we're still getting to know each other, but just  when it comes time to make that final, like, step to be close friends.  Yeah.  We're driving through Times Square to drop her off at a bus station so she can take  a 12-hour bus back home.  Yeah, she had to go to Cleveland. 
[00:52:30]  She was sexy, and she's blowing me, and she's in the backseat peeking.  Oh, shit.  Wonderful.  Oh, man.  No, you know what?  I had a blow.  I have no problem you saying that I was peeking, all right?  I have no problem with that.  Yeah, but what really happened was you got my attention, and then you're taking the rear-view  mirror and fucking making the angle perfect for me.  Of course.  Helping a friend out?  Yeah.  That fucking Latin broad, I don't want to say her name that I was going out with, was so  fucking hot, man.  I jerked off one time, and I had just come into the city after I jerked off, and the 
[00:53:00]  chick you see was sucking his dick in the car, so I sat in the backseat, but my dick was  like a fucking root.  I'm just trying to jerk off, and she was grabbing it, too.  Really?  She was?  Yeah, I think so.  I hope so.  Maybe she's just watching.  I'm just watching.  What the fuck is with these guys?  She was so fucking hot.  Jesus Christ, will you stop pretending I'm not here?  You just threw trash at me?  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, buddy.  I want to hear this.  So into your stupid story, you just, yeah, fucking...  Throwing trash, it's hitting Bobby in the head.  He's running with you, you fucking creeps.  He thought he was at SeaWorld.  Hey, uh...  We're getting...  You know what? 
[00:53:30]  That's pretty fucking funny.  That was pretty good.  You know, it's been a while.  Joe in Vegas is requesting the famous Central Park story.  Oh.  That's a good one.  Can I tell it from the beginning?  Real quick?  No, you don't have to be quick.  This is a great story.  There's a lot of new listeners that haven't heard this one yet.  This is one of their classics.  We were coming out of somewhere, and it's hot...  I mean, it's black chicken.  We're coming by SOBs on Houston.  Yeah, and there's...  What's SOBs?  It's the club.  Not that it matters.  Okay.  There's black chicken.  She was like a nine, right? 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, we said it.  And not smoke.  Came up to me and goes, oh, she knew me from comedy, like B-T or one of those shows.  Boston Comedy Club.  What, Boston?  What's it?  Yeah.  Hot.  Yeah, that's just like a big TV show.  Well, no, whatever.  I don't know what she knew.  A TV show.  She's all over on Def Jam.  It was either Def Jam or a local comedy club.  I'm not sure how she recognized me.  What?  That doesn't matter, okay?  I'm sorry.  I'm very recognizable.  You're right.  You're right.  All right.  Jesus Christ.  I'm admitting fault.  You're right.  All right.  Go ahead.  So she goes, we go, you want to hang out?  We went and got bagels. 
[00:54:30]  And then we go, we were planning to go to the Pete booths already, but we were hungry.  Maybe we weren't even going to go get bagels, but we couldn't say, you want to go straight  to the Pete booths.  We go, let's go eat.  And then we were...  No, we went to a bagel place that was right by the booth.  The booth was on 54th, right up Broadway.  So we went to that bagel place right there so we could just segue.  Oh, let's go to the booth.  We're right here.  Put fucking bagels on your cocks and then fucking blew each other and ate bagels at  the same time.  But wait a minute.  So then we went to the Pete booth.  You guys went to the Pete booth together? 
[00:55:00]  Not in the same booth.  All right.  Well, I brought her into the booth with me and they kicked me out.  The Indian guys go, you know, they kicked us out of the booth.  They do?  And then we're standing on Broadway right across from the Letterman's...  Ed Sullivan Theater.  Oh my God, could you tell the story, please?  Will you calm down?  I'm sorry.  There you are.  So I'm making out with her and I got my hand under her dress.  She has like one of these slip dresses that, you know, you tie.  And I'm fingering her right on Broadway.  Great description of a dress. 
[00:55:30]  I'm fingering her and she's having...  And as I'm fingering her, Norton's standing behind her just squeezing her butt like it's  nice.  With that Norton face when he's getting dirty.  So I fingered her and she came.  She came right on Broadway.  So then we get in the car and we drive her out and we go up to Central Park.  Right?  Norton looks at his false teeth when he's getting really turned on.  He just sucks his top lip in.  His top lip goes in.  He crinkles his nose.  Yeah, his nose comes over his upper lip and then his eyes squint and he gets that little  angry brow. 
[00:56:00]  I'm going to fucking kill somebody.  Wait, did I squat behind her too?  I think I squatted behind her on the fucking...  On Broadway.  Yeah, on Broadway.  You're squatting on your knees grabbing her...  This is 1968?  What?  Who the fuck does that now?  How could you even get away with that?  It was between a newspaper stand and a car.  Yeah.  It was dark.  Oh, well.  Go ahead.  You can tell the rest.  Oh, God.  So then we drive around and we go up to Central Park and we park on the east side.  There's a little wall there.  And we climb over the wall and we go down into the fucking woods of Central Park and she 
[00:56:30]  is fucking hot.  And then she starts blowing me, right?  She's on her.  She's blowing me.  She's standing.  This is fucking cruising with Al Pacino.  She's blowing me.  And then I look down.  Wait, she was standing and blowing you?  She bent over.  No, bent over.  Bent over.  You know, like that.  She forgot to tell us she was a midget.  And then I was the only midget in the story.  And then she bent over blowing me. 
[00:57:00]  And I look down and Norton is eating her ass like it's candy.  I see his face eating her.  You know, I wasn't really into it.  And then I look and I go, he's just eating this strange girl's ass.  Right?  Right in there.  I mean, a girl we picked up walking down the street.  Okay.  And he's got his face in there like candy.  And it's buried in there. 
[00:57:30]  There's a little tongue coming on.  How was it?  Huh?  How was it, Jim?  It was nice.  Nice dumper.  Did she have any roids?  No, I don't remember.  It was dark.  Was it loser ass?  No, that was her ass.  You went in there, like, without any visual assessment of the target.  Not knowing what's around that corner.  Did you feel any wrinkles with your tongue?  No, she was young.  She was 25.  She was tight, man.  This girl was fucking smoking.  I don't know if she blew you.  Did she blow you after?  Yeah, but my dick was kind of half in and out.  So I had to jerk off.  She was like, I'll lick my balls or something. 
[00:58:00]  She hated it.  She didn't want any part of me.  She was just doing it for him.  And I ate her ass, so she probably felt somewhat obligated.  It's like when you let a salesman in the house.  She looked at her, I'm going to get something.  All right.  I'm going to buy something.  What's the cheapest thing you got for sale?  Yeah, shit.  Fuck, man.  So then we're driving home, right?  He just ate her ass.  And I said to him, I go, did you have a good time?  He goes, yeah, it was kind of fun, but I was a little uncomfortable because I don't want  to get my pants dirty kneeling down.  I go, but you'll eat a strange girl's ass and you're worried about grass stains? 
[00:58:30]  Grass stains on the knees of your pants.  And you just rush over things.  Like, he tells a story badly.  He gives it away.  Not that it's a big secret, but it was like the way it happened.  From what I remember, I'm like, yeah, my legs are really sore.  You're like, wow.  I'm like, I was squatting down.  I didn't want to kneel on the grass and get my pants dirty.  You just rushed right to it.  He was so easy to eat our ass.  You reiterated that like we got it.  Okay, but here's the thing.  I explained it perfectly.  You were on the ground.  You don't want to get your pants dirty.  I just want to apologize for my fucking slow, drawn-out Guatemalan story now. 
[00:59:00]  Because now I know what it feels like to you guys.  I just feel like shit.  You know when something happens to you and you're like, oh, fuck, I feel bad.  You know what?  The radio hosts get very uncomfortable when those stories are going slow.  Opie laughed through the story.  I like the story.  So why is he apologizing for our story?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Because you weren't involved in it?  I'm sorry.  Because he was making it.  We're not an improv team, asshole.  I'm not.  I don't fucking care.  You don't care.  You're your own improv team.  Okay?  You're one letter short of fucking improv.  Improved? 
[00:59:30]  Nothing?  No, that would be improv.  You're one letter short of improv.  Improv.  Well, you're a pro.  That stunk on so many different fucking levels.  He's a distinction.  So when you got home and you were living with your mom at the time.  He gets so mad.  Who?  Why are you getting mad?  I'm talking to him now.  I'm asking about this Central Park.  When you got home, because you were living with your mom, and she did your laundry and  saw grass stains, and she'd say, were you eating ass again?  No, I didn't see that's the whole thing.  He never got the grass stains. 
[01:00:00]  That's right.  So why would that...  That's a funny joke if we pretend he had grass stains.  Yeah.  Let's pretend.  Let's pretend.  Suspend.  Just a little suspend.  We already acknowledged that he didn't have grass stains.  This isn't the fucking Carol Burnett show.  It's Carol Burnett.  Who's that?  Is that Carol Burnett's...  Yeah, Carol Burnett.  Again, what?  Is that Carol Burnett's what?  You said what?  Is that her what?  What?  Is that her what?  What?  You said, is that her what?  I'm waiting to hear your joke.  Come on.  I don't have one.  Well, then fucking shit your face. 
[01:00:30]  Is that it for the sex stories?  Do you want to share one more?  I don't know if we have any more.  You don't have any sex stories with your friends where you fucked a bunch of chicks?  With other guys?  I swear to God.  What about you, Anthony?  Nothing?  I actually...  You just bang and shit.  You and your brother never fucking just railed somebody.  Actually, I watched a train once at the fraternity house, but...  Yeah?  That's the first time I got laid was from a train.  The first time I had sex in my life.  I'll tell you this real quick.  Let me...  One guy in front, one in your mouth?  We're staying in... 
[01:01:00]  We're staying down...  We're 17 or 18.  We're staying in Seaside.  It was fucking...  It was 4th of July weekend.  Punchy language.  So we went to some shit hotel that we go to, and it was two beds.  It was me and my friend Brian.  So the lady said, listen, I'm going to rent you guys a bed, and I'm going to rent the other  bed to other kids.  And we go, no other fucking kids...  Did I tell the story?  I don't think I told...  No, I'm just like...  He goes...  There comes another story from Fox.  I go, no other kids are going to rent the room since we already have it.  So we go, okay, we'll take it.  So we took the fucking room.  We go to the ball walk, come back. 
[01:01:30]  She rented the bed and the floor to five other guys.  So now we got seven guys in our room that we don't even know.  Why don't you scream at her?  Huh?  Because we have fucking...  It's 4th of July weekend.  That's the deal.  So I come back to the room.  I come back to the room, and one of the guys is fucking this broad.  This is the first time I got laid in my life.  He's fucking this broad.  I go, can I do that?  I mean, can I have some?  And he goes...  And so I started fucking, and when he was done, I came like...  It was just a fat, semi-fat girl, and I came so quick. 
[01:02:00]  And then I walk out the door, and there was a line down the fucking hallway.  And my friend Brian, he was like six on line.  Dude, that's how it was at the fraternity house.  They put a keg outside the door.  This girl...  There was a whole line of guys just in their underpants.  I was waiting, and it was like our sister sorority.  And the next day, we're having like a beer social at this bar, and she's there just hanging  out like nothing happened.  I couldn't fucking believe it.  We used to do that with a crazy lady, Connie.  She was around 34. 
[01:02:30]  And we used to all fucking just take her to the park and fucking cum on her.  I swear to God.  And then there was another crazy guy.  This other dude who was just out of his mind.  And we'd make them fuck.  He used to just love Ozzy, but he lost his mind.  He'd just say, Ozzy!  And he'd just make the devil horns.  Yeah.  And he was just a fucking lunatic.  And you fucked him, too?  And we used to make her fuck him.  And he'd just be on top going, Ozzy!  And she'd be like, is he all right? 
[01:03:00]  Is he all right?  Is this okay?  Is this all right?  And she'd just repeat herself?  Just two fucking maniacs fucking each other?  And you guys laughing.  Oh, yeah.  There was one lady.  Hold on.  I've got to call a timeout.  A lot of people are asking if you said maternity house instead of fraternity house.  No, I didn't say maternity.  I don't think I did.  Listen to the tape.  I'm sure I could.  I'm going to be listening to the replay later.  Can they check that thing?  That would be hilarious.  Can they run tape, please?  At the maternity house.  At the maternity house.  There was a crazy lady.  If you didn't say that, I'm breaking this microphone over your head. 
[01:03:30]  That's why I don't like when women actually shoot.  They come.  It grosses me out.  Because that fucking crazy broad we used to fuck.  We were fucking on an abandoned school bus one day.  Like six dudes banged her.  I was the last one.  And I was fucking her standing up.  And her pussy just emptied on me.  And I fucking...  Shit.  And it came out like somebody actually turned on a faucet in her uterus.  It just went...  And came out like water. 
[01:04:00]  Fucking visc.  Do you know that there are guys...  Guys like cuckolds and shit that it's called a cream pie?  There are guys that would love to lay under that and take the whole thing in their mouth.  God damn it.  It came out like cream pie?  No, dude.  It fucking...  And that's why I don't like...  I don't like...  I don't really want to find my chick's G-spot.  I don't want her to come.  I just want it all inside.  No, I don't want to fucking see it fucking dribble out like somebody just poured tapioca  on my fucking cock.  You don't like your girl to squirt in your mouth?  No.  Who the fuck now? 
[01:04:30]  Remember that squirter we had with Big A?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That girl was...  She could just squirt at will.  I don't know.  It looked like she was peeing.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Was it real, Jimmy?  It kind of looked like...  Really?  Yeah.  Like spray paint.  And Big A was just right there.  She was airbrushing her pants.  And she was doing it to his face.  Yeah.  I had to go leave in puddles on the floor.  Me and my friend was banging her and her friend.  Man, fuck that.  Oh, shit.  I was selling coke.  What happened? 
[01:05:00]  What happened?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Nothing.  That just came out.  Don't listen to me.  I'm fucking stupid.  You derailed us for a second there.  I did.  I have nothing.  I thought...  First thought it was going to be the beating.  No, no.  First time I...  Whatever.  I had a Hillary Clinton type of joke.  I fucking...  I didn't have completely organized in my head.  I don't like that fucking load.  When women drop loads.  That's just gross to me.  Would you let a couple...  Would you mind if like four or five guys fucked a chick?  And then she put a pussy in your mouth and squeezed it into your throat?  Oh, yeah.  With a giant oyster.  Like toothpaste? 
[01:05:30]  Her clit was just like a thumb.  Just all swollen.  Then you get her pussy opened up.  Like fucking...  Like predator's face.  This is going to discharge.  Comes out like coffee grounds.  Or lines.  Well.  I think this...  I think this train's out of gas.  I know.  I'm kidding.  Yeah.  The old fuck.  We made it to the station.  Yeah, yeah.  Thank God.  We had to get off and walk, but it's not far.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sorry. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  And nobody...  Nobody is helped.  Oh, fuck enough.  Nothing has changed.  Fozzie Bear from Cow Hampshire.  He writes,  If you guys ever talked to Crash from the Toucher and Rich show,  ask him about the homeless McDonald's girl  who used to hide in his mom's house.  Pretty fucked up shit.  We're going to have to get that story on the air.  Maybe tomorrow.  I hit a chick in my basement once.  I told you that.  Oh, yeah.  You hit her there?  No, I hit...  Yeah, the retarded chick used to follow me home all the time.  So one time I let her in because my mom wasn't home. 
[01:06:30]  And I took her in the basement.  She jerked me off with lava soap.  That's got abrasive in it, right?  Just fucking hard.  Yeah.  And then my mother and aunt came home.  I saw the car pull up, so I left her down there.  I went upstairs, and I fell asleep on the couch until like 8.30.  For 22 years.  Dude, I came back.  It was the saddest thing ever.  I opened the tornado doors we had in the back.  How many hours?  It had to be...  We got home probably around 2.30.  Six hours.  I went back at 8.30 at night.  Yeah.  And it was kind of...  I think it was like almost spring, so it was still cold and windy. 
[01:07:00]  And I opened those tornado doors, and just a shivering fucking retard.  Would she still have the soap on her hand, though?  She didn't wash the soap?  She still had the little...  Holy shit.  And I was like, get the fuck out.  Go, go.  I used to put a mattress in the garage, so my roommates wouldn't see me fucking like fat  girls.  I had a mattress in the garage.  Dude, I had a fat chick one time.  I used to...  I put pillows over her whole body, so I would just see her head blowing me.  You know some girls telling that story about you right now.  I know.  And then all of a sudden, there's a retarded guy open the storm drain. 
[01:07:30]  Storm drain.  Yeah, we used to...  I used to sneak these fucking pictures.  I can never fuck fatties.  I fucked a bunch of fat chicks.  I only fucked one.  I fucked a fat chick once, and we were...  You fucked more than one.  You had a mattress in the garage.  I fucking...  You didn't do that for a long time.  You didn't say how many times I fucked her.  I promised this girl a steak and cheese to get her to blow me.  And after she blew me, she wouldn't leave until I bought her the steak and cheese. 
[01:08:00]  She was sitting around.  Deal's a deal.  I'm like, all right.  She's like, yeah, where are you going to get that steak and cheese from?  I'm like, all right, well, I'll give you the fucking...  She ate it watching TV with her fat gut out.  As soon as she was done dipping her fries, she left.  She goes, all right, I'll see you later.  When I was in Vegas, I went down to get an English muffin.  And I went down to get eggs.  And the girl goes, if you get me an English muffin, you can fuck me in the ass.  That's Jesus Christ.  I had to fuck up for a muffin. 
[01:08:30]  Jesus, I would have got you in anyhow.  You're in my bed.  This is Rich Voss from Last Comic Standing Season 1 and Season 3.  I was the guy who didn't win.  You're listening to The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's The Worst of Opie and Anthony with Sam and E-Rock.  Sam, after the break, Intern David back yet again.  Yes, we can never say goodbye to Intern David.  We can never get enough of him.  As a matter of fact, Lisa Sparks, the porn star extraordinaire, couldn't get enough of him either. 
[01:09:00]  Unfortunately, we had a listener pretend he was Lisa Sparks' husband.  And Intern David almost shat himself.  Stay tuned.  It's The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's The Worst of Opie and Anthony with Sam and E-Rock.  Sam, this one features your favorite intern of all time, David.  Intern David, there's never been an intern quite like Intern David.  And this was one of his marquee bits.  Very early on in his internship, we tricked him into thinking.  We had porn star Lisa Sparks in studio.  And we tricked him into thinking that, well, first, we had her kind of give him a lap dance. 
[01:09:30]  And show him her breasts and things of that nature.  Dave likes this because he's never been touched by a woman.  He's very much a virgin.  I'm sure he still is to this day.  And then our listener friend, Carlton.  That's his name, right?  Yeah, that's Carlton.  And then Carlton, who's one of the listeners and superfans of the show, happened to be in studio.  And we told him to pretend he was Lisa Sparks' husband.  As it turned out, Carlton is a very good actor. 
[01:10:00]  Yes, he scared the hell out of David.  Here it is.  On The Worst of The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're listening to The Worst.  The Worst.  I actually felt retarded.  Like, really retarded.  The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right, hey, are we ready?  Steve, is it soundproof?  We're going to attempt something here.  In the other room, cutting IDs and helping Derek with some light.  All right, we got Lisa Sparks.  I told him he's in a soundproof room because...  You didn't tell him she does porn.  Did we say it over there?  No, we didn't. 
[01:10:30]  We said something about her big tits, but we didn't say...  Jim, you said Lisa Sparks is coming in and she...  I don't know if you alluded to it or not.  It doesn't matter.  We're going to say she's just a listener.  And what Lisa's going to do...  I told her, like, she's not going to tell David she's in porn.  She's going to sit.  She has a very short little skirt on.  And she took her panties off.  So she's going to kind of flash him.  Like, while they're talking.  Just show her pussy a little bit.  And we're going to try to get David to talk to her.  And I think that Anthony should indicate to the audience, 
[01:11:00]  whenever we catch him, A, looking up her skirt...  Yes.  We're staring at her big tits.  Yeah, she does have big, beautiful tits.  If you'll hear this.  Yeah, whenever we catch him doing that,  is there anything else we could get him to do?  Yeah, we got other things.  But we can tell without...  After the big reveal, we got some other things we could get.  No, no, no.  I mean, like, before we reveal.  Is there anything else that we can indicate to the audience?  No, it'll be obvious when Ant rings the bell  that he's just staring at her big tits and her can't. 
[01:11:30]  Let's bring her in.  Let's just cross-body block him so his face falls right in our pussy.  Let's bring her in and just talk to her before...  I can't.  We're going to bring her in before.  All right.  Here's Lisa.  She looks really good.  Jesus.  Lisa, before I get to you, I just got to apologize  because it's all about apologies these days on radio.  You know that dumb statue I was just making fun of in Galveston, Texas?  Uh-oh.  What was it?  Well, the locals there had such a horrific hurricane back at the turn of the century,  I believe, somewhere around 1908, 1910, somewhere around there. 
[01:12:00]  Lost a lot of people.  Lost pretty much the entire community a hurricane back in the day.  And I guess that...  That they decided to make a statue to kind of honor those people  that died in that hurricane almost a century ago.  So I'm an idiot.  A century ago?  Yeah.  Fuck them.  I'm an idiot.  Cares about them.  I was going to say, and you're apologizing.  Oh, Lisa, I don't know why your mic would be on.  I know, man.  Why would it be?  Let me see if it's my fault today.  Wow.  Okay.  I'll talk.  Okay.  I don't know why you're apologizing to me about the statue, though. 
[01:12:30]  No, not you.  Not you, you dummy.  Let me see.  Hold on.  Let me see how it looks.  I was just checking.  I feel like I should be like the basic instinct chick.  Come on.  Oh, wait.  Why would that mic work, Jimmy?  You're not going to touch it?  You're not going to indicate at all that he can see your pussy?  I got it.  Can you lean back a little bit?  I want to see how it looks.  Like, say he's talking to you.  How would you continually do it?  Like, if he's talking to you.  He's kind of like, oh.  Yeah, just see if you can.  Make sure you open it so you can see the lips, though.  I'm being really a pervert.  And he's like, hold on.  Just be like, what?  Nah. 
[01:13:00]  Look, she has a nice pussy.  I shaved this morning just for you.  Fucking sexy, man.  Oh, you know panties?  No.  I took them off.  He told me to take them off, so I said, okay.  Yeah, well, if he tells you to take them off, then that's what I do.  Isn't she a trooper?  I'm a trooper.  What are you promoting while you're here?  I don't know.  Oh, she's just hanging.  Can we make panty tea today?  What?  Panty tea.  Panty tea.  What is that?  We get a little hot water.  We dip the panties a few times.  The crotch.  You dip the crotch and the ass of the panties. 
[01:13:30]  But my crotch is clean, so I don't know if you get anything.  Even a clean one's got to leave a little something.  You like that, Jim?  Her vagina is so nice.  You like that?  Yeah, it's plump and sexy.  Shaved.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Freshly today.  Freshly today.  Some people are saying you did tell Dave she's a porn star.  If I did, it's my fault.  I will figure something out.  Let's bring in David.  Intern David.  We want him to interview her.  Yes.  I need to talk.  Yes.  David?  He's a very naive Jewish virgin.  David!  Is he really? 
[01:14:00]  Do we know that?  David!  Where is he?  David!  Oh, that's right.  We learned that last time.  David!  Where is he?  I'm calling him.  David!  You're going to be dead now if it wasn't my David.  David?  That's the best clue.  I'm in the love of my David.  David!  David!  Oh, here he is.  Over there.  Where do I go?  If that's all right with you.  In the big boy chair.  Look at that.  David, this is one of our fine listeners, Lisa.  Hello.  And we want you to interview her. 
[01:14:30]  Okay.  He's like, all right, I got it, I got it.  We want to see what your, uh...  Your interviewing skills are all about.  Yeah, what kind of chops you have.  Make sure your headphones are working, you little sweet man.  Hello.  Okay.  Fine.  Why won't you look at her?  Is your headphones not working?  Why don't you turn the volume up?  Yeah.  It's like, I can't hear.  It's not magic.  There I go.  There I go.  No.  What are you doing?  You're panicking.  You're falling apart.  Panicky Pete.  How is that? 
[01:15:00]  Hello, hello, hello.  He can't hear himself.  Do you have headphones?  No.  No.  Not really.  Mars is on the, uh...  Okay.  Hello, hello, hello, hello.  A little bit.  A little.  That's a good thing to do on the radio.  Just, hello, hello, test, test, check, one, two.  There I go.  Now I got it.  Ah.  So when you see a volume button, why would you turn the volume a little and go, no, and  then not turn it a little more?  I don't know.  Dave, you're having a tough time looking at Lisa.  Why?  I don't know. 
[01:15:30]  Are you angry at her?  I don't know her.  I know.  I'm mad.  I don't know who she is.  I never met her.  All right.  Well, why don't you ask her a few questions and get to know her a little bit.  What are we interviewing?  Because she's a listener and she's up here and it's like we always talk to the listeners  and we never give, we get complaints that we never give the on, like a lot of the staff  time to talk to them.  So.  Yeah.  That's right.  So.  Okay.  Yeah.  Go for it.  Shoot. 
[01:16:00]  I'm all yours.  Okay.  Just get that.  What's your name?  My name's Lisa.  Hi, Lisa.  Where are you from?  I live in Kentucky.  Kentucky.  What are you doing in New York?  I have friends here and I'm visiting.  I listen to the show.  I'm a visitor.  Oh, that's great.  Where in New York are you staying?  Over near Times Square, you know, where all the fun stuff happens.  Oh, do you like, do you like Times Square?  I do.  It's fantastic.  What do you like about it?  It's all the pretty lights.  Definitely.  They're very pretty, aren't they?  Absolutely.  You're a big fan of the Opie and Anthony show? 
[01:16:30]  Absolutely.  You listen every day?  Not every day.  But every morning.  Yeah.  I try.  I gotcha.  I do my best.  It's an interrogation.  So.  I know.  What do you do?  What do you do for a living?  I run websites.  I'm a webmaster.  I'm a geeky.  I'm a computer geek.  What kind of websites are these?  All different kinds.  I've made a ton.  And you mean you like get contracted by the companies to make websites for them?  Absolutely.  I'm a nerd. 
[01:17:00]  I know.  What makes you so experienced in website making?  I've done it for years.  Did you study like computer science in school?  No.  Actually, communications, but same difference.  How did you get experience?  Like when did you make your first website?  Ah, wow.  1999.  Oh, and what was that a website of?  Do you remember your first website?  I do.  It was a picture one.  It had pictures on it.  Was it for a certain company or just on your own?  Just on my own.  Okay.  That's good to know.  How long are you going to be in New York City for? 
[01:17:30]  I leave on Friday.  Friday?  Just a couple days.  Nice little short trip.  Oh, are you upset to go back home?  No, I'm ready to go.  No?  No, because I like my house.  What about New York?  You don't like New York?  No, I love New York.  So then why would you leave?  Well, because I live somewhere else.  Maybe you should move to New York.  Ah, okay.  Maybe.  Why not?  I would.  You should.  I like living in Kentucky.  It's nice and mellow.  Where do you live?  He's like, that's really annoying.  Does that bell signify the end of this interview? 
[01:18:00]  No, no, no.  He's just BSL.  Don't worry about that.  Would you like me to continue with the interview?  Yes, we would.  Would you like to?  You know, I hear tell she might be single there, David.  So maybe ask her a few questions about that.  Yeah.  Yeah, sometimes people go to breakups, listeners.  That's good.  Where do you live with anybody?  Do you have a roommate?  I don't.  Actually, well, I do, yeah.  He's sort of a roommate.  He?  Yeah.  Oh.  It's all right. 
[01:18:30]  Don't let that catch you down.  He's sort of a roommate.  He's gay, David.  What?  He's gay.  He's a roommate.  He's gay.  Is he really?  Absolutely.  Okay, that's good to know.  Yeah.  I wouldn't want you to have another straight roommate be taken already.  Exactly.  I'd be kicking down my door every day.  Yeah.  I can't have that.  What's your current status?  Are you single?  Are you involved with the guy?  Married?  I am all over the place.  I'm all of the above.  All of the above?  All of the above.  See?  She's a girl that's, you know. 
[01:19:00]  All of the above means you're single, you have a boyfriend, you're married all at the  same time?  I have one of everything.  I'm not sure.  What does that mean?  Because a lot of times people are married.  She's already told us this.  And they separate, and the paperwork hasn't gone through, so there's a technical marriage.  Technicalities.  So you're separated, but you're not officially divorced yet.  Exactly.  Is that too much of a touchy subject for you?  No.  Absolutely not.  Are you seeing someone right now?  No.  I'm seeing lots of people, but no.  Not one person in particular. 
[01:19:30]  There you go.  Lots of people.  So how many?  I have no idea.  I can't even count.  I've got one in every city.  Whoa!  You have a guy in every city.  Absolutely.  If you were on vacation in one city, you're like, well, you'll look up the guy in that  city, and you'll, okay.  That's right.  In Miami?  You always get enough sugar days everywhere you go.  Do you have one?  Do you have a guy that you see when you visit New Jersey?  Yes, actually. 
[01:20:00]  But I can take another one.  I'm from Jersey.  Maybe I can replace this guy.  Who is this guy?  He's just a friend.  You like Lisa?  You want to replace the guy?  Nice.  Do you find her attractive, David?  Definitely do, sure.  Yeah?  What do you like about her?  She's good looking.  Uh-huh.  Oh, that's so sweet.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, she's good looking.  What else?  I mean, that's...  Is she your type?  Oh!  What do you like about her?  She has cool tattoos. 
[01:20:30]  Look at that tattoo right there.  Yeah, they're...  I guess they're nice, yeah.  No, he doesn't like my tattoos.  No, he's probably...  He's a very...  He's never there to go with tattoos.  Oh, I have lots of them.  Well...  Hmm.  I don't know.  I don't want to be too honest.  Should I be honest?  Yes!  Go ahead.  Take a good look and let us know.  Well, I don't...  You're not looking.  I'm looking.  I'm looking.  I don't know about this tattoo...  If I'm going to be honest, tattoos really aren't my thing, to be honest.  Well, you're Jewish. 
[01:21:00]  Well, there's only a couple.  She has them on her...  It's nothing big on each ankle.  Yeah, tattoos really aren't my thing.  Do you have tattoos anywhere else, Lisa?  I have one on the back of my neck and one on my lower back.  Oh, can you show them the lower back tattoo?  Is that asking too much?  No, of course not.  If it is, I apologize.  All right.  Okay.  What do you think of that one?  As I said before...  As I said before, I'm not really into tattoos.  Well, but you...  It was right above her hiney hole.  I noticed that. 
[01:21:30]  That's right.  It's perfect placement for people to see.  I noticed that.  Yeah?  Yeah, I noticed.  Do you...  So the tattoos...  She's a very pretty girl.  The tattoos are a turn-off, so you can't bring her home to your parents, obviously.  She should just wear a long skirt, right?  Some socks.  What else?  Yeah.  What do you like about her?  You don't like the tattoos.  What do you like about her?  Look around.  I'm looking.  I'm looking.  I don't...  I don't know.  There's something...  There seems to be a problem.  What's going on over there?  Yeah, what's the matter?  I don't want to be...  I don't want to be... 
[01:22:00]  I don't want to be too honest about my true feelings and embarrass her or make fun of her,  so I don't want to say...  Why would you make fun of her?  I was going to say, you make fun of me.  She's very sexy.  Yeah.  What would...  Yeah, be honest.  You'd have a problem taking her around?  I don't want to be honest, because if I'm honest, it would be too rude.  What's rude about it?  Holy Jesus.  I'll turn off your mic.  I just don't want to be rude.  It's kind of rude.  If I want to say my true feelings...  Lean over to Anthony.  What's rude?  Lean over to Anthony and tell him, because I got your mic off.  Oh, okay. 
[01:22:30]  It's on.  I hear it in the headphones.  I didn't turn it off yet.  Take your headphones off.  All right.  Your mic is off.  Whisper it to Anthony.  Jesus Christ.  What?  He's a flaming homosexual.  Well, what did you say?  You say it.  I mean, come on.  Just get it out in the open.  Nothing offends me.  That isn't offensive to her.  No.  That would be like a girl whispering to one of her girlfriends, I don't like him. 
[01:23:00]  His cock's too big.  You know?  So you might think it's an insult, but she won't.  So you could just be honest and tell her.  And look her in the eye and tell her that.  Yeah.  For once.  Look her in the eye.  Well, it's on.  Again.  Again.  All right.  What are we saying now?  You're telling the truth.  You're just telling her what you told me.  Yeah.  Because it's not an insult.  I don't know.  I don't know.  If I'm going to be honest.  I won't be offended.  It's okay.  Because guys have different tastes. 
[01:23:30]  I have different tastes.  And to be honest, your breasts are a little too big for me, to be honest.  Hey, that's all right.  Your breasts are too big.  Too big.  That's too big for me.  It's okay.  I'm not saying I don't like breasts.  I'm just saying that I like a little smaller.  Hold on, David.  It's okay.  You're only seeing the top.  Cleavage part.  Maybe if you saw the whole breast.  Well, that's why.  We'll do something.  No, but maybe if you saw the what?  A titty monster's going to jump out?  No.  It's not that I don't like.  What do you think about that?  Wow.  I told you. 
[01:24:00]  It's not that I don't like it.  It's just.  Can you take them both out?  Yes, I can.  It's not that I don't like it.  Pump those out.  All right, David.  What's wrong with that?  How about this?  They look.  May I?  Yeah, go ahead.  Now, would you feel one just to see how soft it is?  Just to see if it.  You can.  She won't forget.  Yeah, but it's not that I don't want to feel.  Wait, wait.  What was he going to say?  What was he going to say?  No, no.  Of course you want to feel, but what?  I just.  Everyone has their own preferences.  Yeah.  Yours are men.  But it's just a tit.  No, no, no, they're not.  It's banging out.  No, no, no. 
[01:24:30]  Have you ever grabbed a boob before?  Have you ever grabbed a tit?  I have, yes.  Where?  I don't know.  Just have.  Where?  He's like, just have.  Where?  Walking down the street.  Probably angrily outside of grabber school.  Now, where have you had contact with a breast?  I don't know.  Just have.  In a club a couple of times?  A club?  They don't let you touch them in strip clubs, sir.  That's illegal, David.  Well.  Some girls do.  Just give a little grab.  Give her a little grab.  They're real, too, which is.  I'm not saying they're not real.  I'm not saying that. 
[01:25:00]  Stop insulting her.  I'm not.  We're insulting her.  I asked you before if it was insulting.  You said no.  No, it's not.  I asked before if it was insulting.  You said no, I can say it.  Not touching is insulting.  Yeah, it's insulting.  In this country.  All right, here's David.  He's moving in for a touch.  And don't worry.  Give it a good one.  Use both hands.  Feel the weight.  Feel the weight of it.  Yeah, you know.  Use both hands, all right?  Bring your mic over so you can talk.  I'm going to hear what you're saying.  Yeah, let's.  Okay.  I can't really reach out.  That's all right.  We're fine.  Go ahead.  So what am I doing right now?  Feel it. 
[01:25:30]  There's two big bare tits.  What do you think you're doing?  Yeah, I see.  I see.  How big are those, Lisa?  38 double Ds.  38 double Ds.  Very firm.  No implants, right?  Natural.  All right, David.  Two hands.  Get in there.  All right.  Here we go.  Okay.  Okay.  Just going in.  It's definitely nice to feel, I mean, but.  It was like you were, like, milking a cow.  What at all?  Anyone else knows that?  You've got to touch them a little, like.  You've got to get sexier.  Better than that.  You've got to be a little sexy. 
[01:26:00]  A little more caressing.  You're, like, giving her a fucking breast exam.  Yeah, I know.  Well, I don't know what you want me to do.  Well, there's two 38 double Ds.  They're bare.  Yes, I see that.  You have two hands.  Do you see how God thinks?  I see.  I see.  David, what would you do?  Just rub it like a big mezuzah.  Yeah, just.  Just do what you would do.  What would you do with those?  All right.  Yeah, go ahead.  Go in there.  You would do that.  He's.  Wow.  He's massaging them.  Yeah.  The way one checks a ham before one punches it. 
[01:26:30]  He was.  It's like.  That was.  It's definitely nice.  It's nice.  He was waxing a car.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You were doing a little Daniel-san.  You were kind of assaulting them.  Like, you were searching those tits.  Yeah.  Seeing if they'd stolen anything.  Why don't you gently rub your fingers.  Gently rub your fingers over the nipples.  Yeah, grab the nipples.  Just do that.  Nicely.  Just gently.  Give it a pinch.  So your four fingers go like.  Yeah.  Over her nipples.  There you go, David.  Let's do that.  Wow. 
[01:27:00]  Would you be okay with that?  I'm absolutely fine with it.  Yeah, she's fine.  That's nice that you asked, though.  That's good.  Thank you.  That's very nice of you.  You're very polite.  All right.  Get in there, David.  Give him a little frut.  Okay.  All right.  Let's see how he works the nipple.  Go ahead, David.  Make believe we're not here.  I don't know how you want me to do it.  Much better.  Just kind of let your fingers, like, go, like.  Let your fingers do the walking.  Like, let him skip over the nipple, like, like, like pointer, middle, ring, pinky.  Like, vrp, vrp, back and forth like that. 
[01:27:30]  Just to get, like, a little.  I don't know what you mean, like.  Just try it out.  Jimmy will help you through it.  He looks like David Patterson reading.  Just like that.  Like, you just caress, pinch a little bit, but lightly.  Yeah, let's go, David.  You just kind of, like, feel nicely with your thumb.  Just touch nicely.  Get a knife and cut them off.  All right.  Hey, hey, hey.  Well.  That's good.  Very good, David.  Now I'm just scraping gum off them.  David.  Is that the appropriate way? 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, but you're just touching them.  Yeah.  It's like, you should actually put your face against one.  You don't have to do anything.  You just put your face against it.  Yeah, the side of your head.  It's nice.  It's like a sleeping.  Yeah, see if she has warm bosoms.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Take your headphones off.  Yeah, it's fine.  We're here.  Yeah, we're here for you.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Don't be embarrassed.  We can't see it.  Fine.  Yeah, they can't see.  Go ahead.  Who can't see?  Go ahead.  So what exactly am I doing?  What are you doing? 
[01:28:30]  What every guy in the room wants to do.  We've got to get someone to play the part of the Joe's husband.  That's nice.  Take your glasses off.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Please, for a second.  That was very matronly and motherly, the way you did that.  Yeah, it was.  How do you want me to do it?  I'll show you.  This is not about me.  This is about...  He's always ready to go.  I'll do it.  I'm not going to do it.  You just go like this.  Brush your lips just gently against the nipple.  You don't have to do anything.  Just be gentle.  What was I doing before? 
[01:29:00]  What were you doing before?  You look like a ram fighting another ram for the right to mate.  Come on, dear.  Don't be shy.  Aw, look at that.  With his glasses.  How about your nose, your mouth?  What are you not...  I'm doing what you're doing.  No, you're rubbing your head like fucking...  He looks like Rain Man.  When Rain Man would rub his head against something.  Oh, right.  You get a...  Rub your...  This is what you're doing.  That's what you're doing.  No, I was doing this.  I was...  This is the top of your head. 
[01:29:30]  This is the side of my face.  Watch.  I love this part.  See?  Okay.  You rub your face against the nipple.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Feel free.  He just rubbed his head.  It looks like he's washing his face with a tit.  It looks like they just brought that hot towel in first class.  And he's wiping his face with it.  It happens.  A little bit.  There's nothing...  That's exactly what you were doing.  Yeah, there's nothing wrong with what you were doing.  I was doing a little different.  David's doing a fine job. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, I'm not saying it's bad.  You look shy.  Would you...  No, I'm shy.  I'm only shy because I didn't know that I was going to be doing this.  I had no idea.  We didn't know.  We didn't have enough prep time.  What's your religious background?  Who?  Oh, you.  Me?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Christian, I guess.  Yeah?  Okay.  I grew up Baptist.  I don't know.  What about...  How filthy is this?  A little mixed religious thing there?  You should suck one.  What if...  What...  Jeez.  You should suck one.  Yeah.  You need a rabbi to bless it first.  Are those kosher tits? 
[01:30:30]  You should just suck one.  Probably not.  You probably should.  You should suck one, I think.  Just a little bit.  Just a little.  I don't think that's a little more inappropriate.  Well, you know, you just start kissing the nipple a little bit and then if, you know, sucking  is involved, that's fine.  If not, you know, you do what you want.  Kiss the nipple.  It's like, uh...  That's like your personal playground right now.  If you're gonna kiss the nipple.  I'll show you on the other one.  All right.  Jimmy will show you on the other one.  Thank God there's two.  You hold it up like this.  Okay.  You look at your friends and you go, eh. 
[01:31:00]  You hear?  Aw.  Aw, you could do that.  That's sweet.  I can give a kiss.  It's like kissing Nana.  I mean, I can do it however I want, but I'm trying to do it the way you were telling me  to do it.  No, whatever you want.  No, no.  You do it your own style.  Why don't you be like De Niro in Cape Fear?  Yeah, yeah.  Cape Fear?  Get in there.  Get in there, Jimmy.  Your own style, sir.  Get in there.  All right.  However you want to do it.  All right.  He's taking the headphones off.  He's going in.  He's going in for the kiss. 
[01:31:30]  Wait.  Can we get a mic on it?  Ooh.  Hold on.  He's licking.  You're licking.  I was impressed.  That's not fair.  The guy was licking the nipple.  You don't have to back off so quickly, sir.  Wow.  Hold on.  Anthony, can you?  Let's find out exactly what Anthony wants you to do.  I think that was...  Anthony, can you tell David?  Oh, I would actually, if you could, grab the breast and do what you were doing. 
[01:32:00]  A little kissing.  Grab one of the breasts with one hand.  Yes, yes.  And then just kiss the nipple a little more and then lick around the nipple a little if  you feel...  That's what I started to do before on my own.  All right, yeah.  But you don't have to cut it so short.  You can do whatever, you know, you want.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know if you want me to do a specific...  Yes, whatever.  You know, wing it.  Look.  All right.  Wing it.  Yeah.  Yeah, she likes to have fun.  Sure, sure.  Okay.  Don't you worry.  Can you see?  Okay.  What are we doing?  Roll over there. 
[01:32:30]  Using a kiss to her left breast.  Oh, yeah.  Very good.  Do what I was doing before.  Just hold it.  Yeah, whatever you're comfortable with.  It's up to you.  You're doing great.  Okay.  But if she likes it...  I'm here.  Do you like it?  Absolutely.  All right.  Good for me.  You want me to say anything?  Just get in there.  No, no, no.  I don't have to say anything.  All right.  Oh, this is going to play the part of it.  Great. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, this is bad.  It's getting better.  Wow.  All right.  That's not bad.  Hey.  You're kind of getting into it there.  I like that.  Yeah.  That's...  Yeah, you're kind of getting into it.  Do you want to touch her legs?  She has really beautiful legs.  I like she has nice, feminine, soft legs.  I don't know if you're going to get a chance at this again, man.  Look at those big...  I didn't know I was going to have this chance at all.  It's fantastic, isn't it?  I didn't know I was going to be doing this.  David, I noticed you were looking like at her...  Oh, that's why.  Oh, wow.  No panties down there.  Wow.  Did you notice? 
[01:33:30]  I saw you looking at the...  I certainly did notice.  I don't know if I'm supposed to mention that or not, so I didn't say anything.  Oh, well, you noticed, all right?  I noticed.  Why don't you face him a little bit and...  Yeah, could you open your...  A little view.  Oh, there we go.  Yeah.  What do you think of that?  What do you think, David?  I forgot that I had a skirt on.  You've been that close to one?  Oh, that's very nice.  It's nice.  Well, yeah.  Well, most people would yell out, Jesus, but in your case...  Look at that, huh?  What do you think?  That's where...  That's where a cock goes. 
[01:34:00]  Sometimes.  He has a little chuckle.  David, what do you think?  I think it's very nice.  You want to touch it?  I don't know what I'm allowed to do or not allowed to do, so...  Well, ask Lisa.  I'm not going to...  You can touch it if you'd like.  I would touch it if I'm allowed.  All right.  Well, sure.  There it is.  Wow, look at that.  I'll even bring it to you.  Look at that.  So what do I...  Okay.  What are you doing?  Sam, get out of the way of that camera.  Just touch it?  Thank you.  Go down there.  Get really close. 
[01:34:30]  Can Sam see?  Hey, could you, like, use your thighs to close up his ears while he's in there?  Why not?  Just...  You don't have to lick it.  Don't lick it.  Just get close.  No?  No, don't lick it.  Just get close.  Just kiss the thighs.  No licking.  No, no licking the pussy.  Just kiss the thighs.  We don't know where she's been.  What?  I don't.  I don't even know who she...  I don't know anything.  It might be all...  It's fine, though.  You can look at it.  Get close and look at it.  Don't touch it.  Okay.  You can touch it.  No, you can touch it.  You can give it a touch.  Touch it with your fingers.  Give it a touch.  We'll be born. 
[01:35:00]  What do you think?  Hold on.  Can you get in there, Sam?  Kiss the thigh.  Can you see?  Yeah.  And then touch a little and kiss the thigh.  That'll work, right?  It should.  All right.  Yeah, touch the vagina again the way you did.  That was good the way you were touching it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Touch again.  I swear he's going to become a director one day.  I know.  He's good.  Touch.  Touch.  Do you want to look at the hiney hole next?  It's up to you guys.  What do you want me to do?  I don't know what you want me to do. 
[01:35:30]  We know.  What am I going to do?  Touch it again.  All right.  Let's go.  Touch again.  Touch the vagina.  There you go.  That's the pussy.  Touch it.  What is he doing, Jimmy?  I can't see.  I don't know.  Do you know where that special spot is?  Find the special spot.  Here's one.  Just run your finger right down that little credit card.  It kind of looks like a credit card swipe thing.  You kind of look like you're checking bad fruit. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You touch it.  Just touch it.  Just touch softly.  We want you to find it.  Yeah, that's it.  We want you to find the sensitive area there.  Yeah.  All righty.  Just touch softly.  All righty.  Okay, he's poking around in there.  Is he finding it, Jimmy?  No.  No.  He's running his hands over it.  Along the, but on the outside edges.  Yeah.  So you need to go dead center.  And kind of rub your finger down the middle a little bit.  She's okay with it. 
[01:36:30]  I'm perfectly fine.  Go ahead.  Put it down the middle a couple of, a couple of few times.  All righty.  All right.  All righty.  There you go.  All the way down.  Oh, well.  Lisa, why are you laughing?  I don't know if that's the reaction we're going for.  No, it's good.  It's the way he's opening.  He looks like he's opening curtains.  Yes, yes.  Wow.  He's making sure it was getting open.  Well, that's good.  A meat variety.  Do you like the vagina?  Yes, I do.  All right.  Definitely.  Cool.  Could she rub your legs a minute?  Because I feel bad.  Could she rub your leg a little bit? 
[01:37:00]  If she wants to, it's up to her.  I wouldn't mind.  I want to see you rub your leg.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Hey, Lisa, what's okay?  Lisa, what is he packing?  You can feel through his jeans.  Is he packing anything?  Yeah.  I can feel it through the jeans.  So that's always a good sign, right?  That's always a good sign.  Why don't you guys get a little closer?  Get a little more comfortable.  Why not?  How close do you want me to get?  As close as you want.  As close as you want me to get.  Obviously, you know.  How close do you want to get?  It's really up to you, whatever she's told me to do.  She wants me to sit on your lap. 
[01:37:30]  She seems to be a wild girl.  Would you like that?  I would like that, sure.  Okay.  How about you sit where she is?  This way the pal-to-a-camers can see.  Okay.  Let them sit first.  And let Lisa, who is a wowee.  Wow.  And you sit there, young David.  The chair of honor.  Yes, yes.  The chair of honor.  And you can always talk.  I'm just, oh, boy, what a heine.  You can sit right there.  David, this Lisa is a wild one, huh?  She's great.  I am.  Oh, look at that.  The heine.  What exactly?  She'll rub your cock a little.  No, but what do you want me to do? 
[01:38:00]  You can grab her boobs from behind.  It would be a good sign.  Yeah.  Is there anything specific on me?  Do I just do whatever I want?  No.  It's whatever you want, David.  Now he's like, I don't want to.  What do you want me to do?  Do you want me to do something specific?  David, can someone get in here with a microphone, an extra microphone that we'll reach?  David, at this point, grab that one, Jimmy, and just...  Oh, good idea.  Good idea.  All right.  Good idea.  Okay.  Or hip-hop, you got that on?  There's anything specific on me you can do, or I can just do whatever I want.  David, how about we do a little freestyle?  You're on your own now.  We set you up nice here.  Hey, Lisa, could you face David?  Maybe you can put your breasts in his face and touch his penis. 
[01:38:30]  Why not?  All right.  It's harmless.  It's harmless, David.  It's fun stuff, right?  Scoop back a little, Dave.  Don't be so selfish, please.  No, it's a big chair.  It's a big chair.  Yeah.  Roll with it.  What?  Let's see what happens.  Yeah.  Yeah, let them throw out.  We can do that any time.  Oh.  Hi, dear.  She's sitting on his lap.  I know.  Do you want to touch her juicy little big...  Yeah, run your hands down her ass.  Yeah, have fun, David.  That's it.  David is, uh, this little ass.  Aggressively rubbing her boobs. 
[01:39:00]  She's bouncing up and down.  He's rubbing her arms.  That's good.  How about that ass?  He's like a grandmother.  You might want to grab it.  Grab that big ace.  Put your hands around back.  Yeah, there you go.  What do you think, David?  Now push your hips forward and stick your dick in her.  Yeah.  I mean, no.  I mean, just...  Are you kidding?  Can she rub your penis through your jeans?  I was.  If she wants to.  I was.  All right, yeah.  Keep rubbing.  I was.  All right, so he's grabbing her ass now aggressively.  Cool.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:39:30]  Cool.  And, um...  This is nice.  You like it?  I like it.  It feels better than you probably thought it would.  Yeah.  Right.  David, you want to at least sit in your underwear?  That'd be kind of cool.  Not naked, though.  You can't be naked.  You can't be completely naked.  No.  Not naked, but...  Put in underwear.  Underwear's okay.  No, no, no.  No, why not?  I don't think so.  Underwear?  I don't think so.  All right, keep...  I don't think so.  All right, play with her boobs and...  Are you embarrassed?  Are you clipped?  Of course.  Yes.  Stop it.  Are you embarrassed? 
[01:40:00]  I guess.  To be in your underwear?  Oh.  All right, that's okay.  All right.  Well, go ahead.  Let's not...  Do you feel her pussy against your cock over there?  No.  Not really.  A little bit?  Oh, the chair's not conducive for that?  Can we get a better chair?  I really don't, to be honest.  All right.  How about you lean back a little more and push it?  No, no.  No, I mean, if you slouch in the chair a bit, you'll get there.  You move down.  Yeah.  Now, holy shit. 
[01:40:30]  Dude, your pocket's sticking up.  Whoops.  No, I'm talking about him.  She just backed into a black microphone and the microphone almost disappeared.  I think you have to adjust yourself, don't you?  Oh, me?  Yeah, where's your dick?  Down by your pocket?  There's a better chair.  Better chair over there?  All right.  Here, David.  Give him that other chair.  Oh, well, there's a better chair.  I think David is kind of liking this whole thing.  Yeah, David, get in there.  He can't stand up.  Make a little pup tent.  All right, David.  Now have fun. 
[01:41:00]  This is all you, buddy.  It's going to be better.  Yes.  I think this is a little bit...  Oh, see?  There you go.  You guys go at it.  Go at it.  There we go.  She's riding his lap in the jeans.  That's it.  He has his arms straight out.  All right, Sam.  Sam can move a little bit.  Thank you.  David, you can touch it.  Your arms are in fists straight out.  Spank her a little bit.  Oh, is she going to spank?  You can take it a little harder than that, dear.  Spank her.  No.  You can spank her.  Just a little tap.  A little love tap.  You want me to show you how to do it?  A lot. 
[01:41:30]  She'll show you.  See?  See?  She doesn't mind it at all.  She likes it.  Exactly.  Yeah, keep spanking her.  I'll have a red ass.  See what happens.  Might be a bust.  You know what I do?  You always get back to this.  Yeah.  What the fuck are you doing?  What the fuck are you doing to my wife?  Huh?  Huh?  Don't be mean.  No, let me do it.  Don't be mean.  Uh-oh.  I just listen on the radio.  I just listen to what I'm coming to see.  What the fuck's wrong with you?  You're not supposed to be here.  Shut up!  I'll do what you want to get home. 
[01:42:00]  Okay.  As for you, why are you touching my wife?  Why are you touching my wife?  I didn't know she...  I didn't know...  Why are you touching my wife?  I didn't even know you were here.  Oh, shit.  I didn't know you were her wife.  Oh, fuck.  Look, it's...  Who hides this prick?  Dude, we just...  We told you to be respectful.  I stepped like a fucking twit.  Dude, we just thought that we didn't know.  We thought you guys were broken up and shit.  No, we're not broken up.  She said that they were...  No, we're not fucking broken up.  All right.  Let's hold the guy back.  She knows it as well.  Mars, hold the guy back.  This is not good. 
[01:42:30]  We told him to be respectful.  Yeah, hold it.  Yeah, he...  He was okay.  Ooh, this ain't good.  He was nice.  Nice.  He didn't stick anything in anywhere.  David?  I'm going to stick something to him in about three seconds.  How about that?  David, you at least told the guy an apology.  Yeah.  No one doesn't have an apology.  She's going to get an ass kick in about three seconds.  Get up.  Get up.  Get up.  Look, there's no need for...  Fuck that. Get up.  Dude, there's no need for violence.  He was just...  David, what's the matter? 
[01:43:00]  He was just...  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  All right.  Oh, my God, now.  Now there's going to be a problem.  David.  David.  Stop, stop, stop.  David, run.  What do I do?  David, just fucking run.  Run.  Run.  I'll be getting held back.  Fucking run.  Run.  Get out of here.  Lock the door.  Lock the door.  How do we lock this?  Stop, stop, stop.  What do I do? 
[01:43:30]  What do I do?  What do I do?  Wait, wait, wait.  Okay, that guy was really good.  He's very good.  They got audio.  They got audio.  Is that really her husband or is it a joke?  Is this a joke, like, playing that joke on me to try to, like...  He's really the husband?  He's really upset? 
[01:44:00]  Come out.  Get the fuck out.  Right the fuck down.  Get the fuck out the room.  Get the fuck...  No, no, stop, stop, stop.  Wait a minute.  This is too much.  Get the fuck out of the room.  I can't do this.  Get the fuck out the room.  Get out the...  It's my second...  It's my second day of the interview.  I'm not gonna hit him.  Get off me.  Get the fuck out of me. 
[01:44:30]  It's my second day of the interview.  Get the...  It's my second day of the interview.  It's my second day of the interview.  Oh, God.  Wait, am I supposed to...  Oh, wait a minute.  I can't do this.  Yo, Dave, run.  Run.  Run out the room.  Run out the room.  Run, run, run.  Run, David.  David, just run.  Get out.  Get out.  Run, David.  Run.  David, run.  Get out.  Get out of the hole.  Just run.  Go.  Get the fuck over here.  Go downstairs.  Go downstairs.  Go downstairs.  He fell down. 
[01:45:00]  He fell down.  He fell down.  Come on.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Holy shit.  Is he young?  Where did he go?  Yeah, he's gone.  Wow, you did a fucking...  That guy was so good.  That guy was fucking good.  He was great.  He's a good actor.  That's a regular listener.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Honey, don't beat up the little white boy.  He comes by...  He's tired now.  Wait.  He comes by and watches the show all the time. 
[01:45:30]  We finally got involved.  Let's bring David in to apologize.  Just don't give it away.  Wait.  Can we hold him down?  We calmed you down.  Hold him down.  Hold him down.  Like, have him held down in a chair.  He just wants...  Now, we calmed him down and talk.  All he wants is an apology.  Tell him we calmed him down and talk to him, and he just wants an apology.  Get him in that big chair and make believe you're holding him down.  Who's holding him down?  Me?  You guys.  Yeah, but don't laugh.  Don't give it away.  Okay.  David, he just wants an apology.  I'll try to get him in here to apologize to you. 
[01:46:00]  Mars and Steve.  Should we sit on him?  Yeah.  Okay.  Hold him, Mars.  Hold his arms.  Wait, yeah.  David, yeah.  Let's bring David in.  Did you know me and Anthony know he was here and he was going to attack me like that?  They didn't know.  This is your one.  It's not good.  Jim, do you guys know that he's a good guy?  Or he was going to come in and attack me?  Is that planned?  No.  It was planned for me to go in there and do stuff with her.  That was planned.  Yeah, we don't know what's going to happen. 
[01:46:30]  The guy comes once in a while, but we didn't know what the relationship was.  We don't know.  But did you know he was going to come and attack me like that?  No, dude.  How are we supposed to know that?  No, no, no.  He didn't attack you.  He was just yelling.  You could have.  We held him back.  That's fine.  Why did you?  You guys told me to go up to like...  Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to do all that.  You know, we would like just touch her respectfully.  We didn't realize you were going to put your fingers in it.  Hey, shit, get in here.  He just wants you to apologize.  He feels like...  But it wasn't my toy.  You...  He came in.  You were sucking her tail.  Face me like a man to get your ass in here.  It's a guy's wife.  It's a guy's wife.  What do you know?  But did you know he was going to be there and attack me? 
[01:47:00]  Come on!  No, I wouldn't have touched her if I knew that.  But just don't say I did anything.  Just apologize.  Apologize.  Always be here, Martin.  You disrespected the guy.  Holy shit.  David, first of all, we owe you an apology.  We didn't know the guy.  I had no fucking idea.  We told him, though.  We did tell David to kind of just be respectful and stuff like that.  I don't mean to.  She comes by the show a lot.  She's a slut.  Hey, hey, hey.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  You got a little carried away.  First of all, I don't want to offend anybody. 
[01:47:30]  I understand.  We're holding him down, as you can see.  I don't want to offend the husband.  I don't even want to offend you two.  Yeah, but the thing is, we were just telling you to touch her.  But you got a little carried away.  You were stuck in her tits.  You put her on your lap.  We didn't tell you to do any of that stuff.  You were what?  I didn't know this was going to even happen.  No, but you're looking between her legs.  You're kind of making her uncomfortable.  He needs to know what you actually did to her.  And then you got to apologize for it.  Just tell the truth.  That's what he told us he wants.  Tell the truth.  For whatever reason.  Sorry for what?  What did you do to her? 
[01:48:00]  He's held down nice luck.  He's all right.  Just talk to him and tell him.  He's exhausted.  So what do I...  Just tell the truth about what you did.  What did you do?  You make us all look like fucking creeps.  That's all he wants is an apology for...  But he needs to know what you did to his wife.  Because it didn't go all that far.  No, it didn't go all that far.  Not at all.  Because he's thinking it was a lot worse.  So explain what you did.  No, no.  It wasn't a lot worse.  What did you do to Lisa and apologize for it?  Okay, well...  Well, I came into the...  Look me in the eye and tell him what the fuck you did.  I came into the studio and I met her and I was asking her some questions. 
[01:48:30]  And then what happened?  And then I looked at her.  And then I looked at her and I touched her breasts a little.  And then I kissed them a little.  And then I touched her legs and thigh area a little bit.  And then she...  Tell him everything, Derek.  And then she got on top of me and...  Wait, wait.  Jimmy is something out there.  He knows it.  He saw it.  Just tell him everything.  Because everything is videotaped.  So he's going to see the videotape anyway.  What?  There's more?  Did you not tell me?  And then after that she got on top of me and started moving up and down. 
[01:49:00]  And I started touching her and caressing her.  Touching her where?  On her breasts, on her ass, up and down her back.  I touched her on her vagina a little bit.  You did what?  A little.  What?  Are you fl...  You should have left that part out, probably.  You said to say everything.  Yeah, but, you know, by that we would...  Oh, boy.  You know, stuff you get away with.  A strip club.  No, no, no.  Please get up.  No, no, no, no, no.  Please.  I want to throw you...  Tell her what...  Tell her what she did to me. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, you better tell her.  What possessed you to do that?  What possessed me?  What possessed...  What the...  Why would you do that?  I don't really know what to say.  I don't know what to...  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Why would you do that?  I don't know what to say.  I'm not supposed to say why I did that.  I don't know.  How about to say that I apologize  and I'll take my ass kicked like a man?  How about that?  Say that.  Look, it's not cool you guys are holding the guy down.  Let him go.  I don't think he's going to do anything.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  What?  Stop, stop, stop.  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. 
[01:50:00]  Bump, touch it like that.  Oh, no, no.  Oh, Jesus.  Bump, sit him down.  It's Crown Heights.  Just tell her...  Bump, touch it like that.  You were...  Just tell her that she was touching you too, right?  Just say it, David.  You got to confess.  She was touching me too.  Where?  She was touching me on my dick a little.  She grabbed.  Whoops.  She grabbed it a little.  Whoops.  I slipped and fell.  Oh, boy.  David.  We'll talk later.  Okay.  David.  So, I'm going to get...  I just want to say that I'm very sorry for doing this. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, you're sorry?  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  It'll never happen again.  Oh, yeah.  You're damn right.  I will leave this room and I won't talk to her ever again if that's what you want.  I apologize.  It'll never happen again, so I'm going to make sure that you'll touch anybody again.  Anybody?  Ever.  I think we...  You know, the threats should stay...  Ever.  Maybe just not your wife.  Maybe just not your wife.  You know what?  David.  Go.  Go.  You did your job.  Go.  Okay.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Run.  Run.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Asshole.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Holy shit. 
[01:51:00]  Yes.  And scene.  And scene.  Bravo.  Wow.  That was great.  Is this a stunt like this guy coming over?  Is this a stunt like this guy coming over?  Is this a stunt like this guy?  He really didn't know he was going to be here.  Is this a stunt?  Is that guy an actor?  Let me go out there before he knows.  Let me go out there and talk to him for more seconds.  He doesn't know yet, does he?  No.  You want to tell him?  Or should we let it be? 
[01:51:30]  No, I'm not going to tell him.  I just want to see if it bothers him in a black guy.  Oh, I go.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy.  Is he playing a black joke on me as a new intern?  Or is he really the husband and he's really upset at me?  Is he really the husband of her?  Can I tell you guys how much I love this show?  What's your name, bro?  Carlton.  Carlton, you ruled.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I had no confidence that you could actually be on a break.  Come on.  You know how to act mad?  Let's see what you're going to say.  Is he playing a new intern or is he really the husband and he's really upset about me? 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, he'll be okay.  He's not a big guy.  He's not going to freak out.  He's relaxing now.  So he's really the husband.  He's really upset.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But he thinks that you don't like the whole black-white marriage thing.  That's not true.  When did I say that?  I didn't say that.  You're screaming in the hallway.  Let's go into a speech.  I didn't say anything about that.  Yeah.  I never said that.  Why does he think that?  How do I know that he's really the husband? 
[01:52:30]  I don't know.  I guess so.  I mean, I don't know the guy.  I just know that he came in and he was a little freaked out.  I mean, we got to make it interesting for the radio.  We have to because it's happening.  We can't not make it interesting.  But he thinks...  It's not a joke.  He's really...  Yes!  He's the husband.  I mean, he's...  They're okay.  He'll be okay.  He's relaxing now.  Are you playing like a practical joke on me as being a new intern?  Or is he really just came out and you didn't know he was going to come?  No idea he was going to come.  We don't know what that relationship is.  He's been here before, but we didn't know. 
[01:53:00]  We don't ask.  You promise?  He's really the husband?  He's really upset?  Yes.  Okay.  He thinks that the whole interracial thing is bothering you.  But I didn't...  And that you're basically...  Is that okay?  Because basically he thinks that the whole black and white issue is what...  Like, you feel like it's a black man with a white woman and you don't like that.  So you can pretty much do what you want to do.  What gives him the right to think?  But I didn't say anything about...  Gives him the right.  He thinks that because he thinks, like... 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, you know she was dating a match with a black guy.  And you're just going to grab her big white titties and not care what he's doing.  Well, I didn't...  When I was grabbing her titties, I didn't know that her husband was black.  Heck, how did I know?  I didn't know that.  Yeah, but he thinks that you did know it and that's why you did it.  You didn't tell me that her husband was black.  Yeah, but I told him I did because he was mad at me.  But I didn't know.  Well, tell him that.  Don't tell me that.  Tell him that.  Just tell him that because he thinks...  I'm not going to go near him.  He's going to bite punch me in the face of a dark man conscious.  No, no, no.  We'll protect you.  What was happening?  He's been in that man conscious, this guy.  I don't know. 
[01:54:00]  We'll look out for you.  But just make sure that...  Just apologize, Tony.  I...  Well...  He thinks that you saw...  I didn't know that her husband...  At least he didn't fucking tell me.  You don't care that they're in a racial matter.  He's sitting right there.  How do you not pick him up? 
[01:54:30]  What happened, Jimmy?  You guys couldn't...  I was saying basically...  We didn't hear.  We took a break.  What happened?  Basically, I was telling David the issue of race and how...  Yeah.  That the husband feels that...  You know what he was saying about how...  About David grabbing her big white tits because he didn't like the fact that she was with a black guy and he hates that kind of shit.  And now he's claiming he didn't know her husband was black, whatever.  I mean...  David?  Hmm.  What?  Is that true? 
[01:55:00]  That is true.  The honest truth is that I didn't know that her husband...  Her husband was black.  And even if...  And even that you are black, that doesn't mean anything to me.  I'm not...  I'm not racist.  I don't...  I don't care about that.  That's fine with me.  I don't have a problem with racism...  With race like that.  You don't have a problem with racism?  Yeah, you're basically saying that if she wants to ruin her life, you don't care?  No, I don't have a problem with her marrying a black man.  I didn't even know that her husband was black.  No one told me that.  But you probably knew she had a husband and you didn't care.  And even that you are black, it doesn't matter anything to me. 
[01:55:30]  And I'm not trying to be offensive to you at all.  And if I was by any means, I sincerely apologize to you.  I am sorry.  And you don't say the N-word, right?  Never, never.  Yeah.  Maybe.  No, never.  Have you ever said it?  We all have said it.  I've never said it.  See, that's the problem.  There's dishonesty here.  Yeah.  We all say it.  We're not proud that we do.  And we make sure the windows are rolled up usually.  So, like, everybody admits to it.  You probably said it at one point in your life.  Maybe as a kid, it's a stupid thing to do. 
[01:56:00]  I understand that.  Anyone would understand that.  I wouldn't say it to anyone's face.  No, no.  But you've said it before.  I know that.  At least everyone has.  Not to, not to.  Wait, Jimmy, have you said the word?  No.  Not proud of it, but you have.  Anthony, you don't even have to ask him.  I have.  Sam, have you said it?  I said it.  Hip-hop?  Yeah, I've said it.  Steve, Lisa, probably in bed.  Yeah, sure.  Mars.  Yes.  Yeah.  Have you said the word? 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Under what circumstances?  Wait, what word?  What's that?  What word have you said?  I said nigger a couple of times.  What?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Holy shit.  Not in front of anybody.  Not in front of anyone.  You just did.  Yeah, but I'm not saying to be offensive to him.  I'm saying because we're talking about it.  You're saying, did you ever say...  David, when I said what, everyone says the n-word.  Wow, you say the n-word now.  That's...  He is getting fucking pissed. 
[01:57:00]  So when did you say it?  Not in front of people.  What does that mean?  That means that's your true feelings.  No.  When do you say it then?  Never.  Very rarely.  When?  What occasions?  Rarely.  Rarely.  Rarely.  Rarely.  Rarely.  Rarely.  Rarely.  Rarely.  Rarely.  Rarely.  Rarely.  Rarely.  Rarely.  Rarely.  Rarely.  You should apologize for calling him...  I didn't call him.  I didn't call him an n-word.  I just said, yes, I've said it before.  I didn't call it to him.  I never would.  But when have you said it?  You said you say it frequently.  No, I didn't say I say it frequently.  No, I didn't.  When do you say it, though?  You said on occasion it'll come out, but not around people. 
[01:57:30]  No, not on occasion.  No.  When?  It won't come out.  It usually never comes out.  The question was, have you ever said it?  So, yes.  When did you say it?  When was the last time you said it?  I honestly can't remember.  I was just joking around with friends.  Oh.  What kind of joke was that?  I really don't remember.  Like me to help you to remember?  What?  Like me to help you to remember.  Oh, boy.  No.  Uh-oh.  Is everyone okay here?  I don't know.  Lisa, you all right?  It's gotten very uncomfortable.  I'm okay. 
[01:58:00]  It's gotten very uncomfortable.  You're okay with the fact that David, the Jewish guy, was squeezing your big tits and fingering you?  You all right with that?  It was fine with me.  Did we take it too far?  No, it was okay with me.  All right.  David, you were all right with that.  You did that, obviously, right?  Yeah.  I was all right with that.  I didn't know her husband was going to come and barb in like that.  Yeah.  Hopefully, he cock-blocked you, basically.  Yeah.  Basically, yes.  Were you thinking, um...  I cock-blocked you.  Wow.  I think he's just goofing around, sir.  I think he's just like...  First you said it, and what?  Now I'm cock-blocking you from hitting on my wife. 
[01:58:30]  Well, obviously, you came in here.  You just make a bad situation worse for yourself, son.  What's that?  Just keep making a bad situation worse for yourself.  Just keep on talking.  David, what do you think of someone that would...  Keep on talking.  What do you think of someone that would, like, you know, fool around with you that easily  that's married?  Hmm.  Go on.  Say it.  I mean, I...  I dare you.  I think, in a way, you got to defend yourself here because...  No, he doesn't.  You know.  Well, if I'm going to be honest, I mean...  Yeah, yeah.  Be honest.  She told me that she was separated from her husband. 
[01:59:00]  Really?  So, I mean, which means...  I took it to mean that...  She wasn't divorced.  We knew that, right?  Well, I knew that she wasn't divorced, but she said that she was separated and that she  wasn't seeing, like, her husband anymore.  They were separated.  They were going to get a divorce, so I thought, like, okay.  I didn't...  So, you feel that that's a green light for years ago when you start feeling her up?  Yeah.  What do you think of Lisa for letting you do that now that you know that she actually  is far from being divorced, obviously?  What do you think of Lisa? 
[01:59:30]  Well, I think that's kind of...  Well, I could be a little bit rude.  I mean, you should have at least warned me.  I didn't know he was coming.  You didn't know that he was in...  Did you know he was in New York?  No.  Where did you think he was?  Back in Kentucky?  I don't know.  You didn't know that your husband was in New York?  I don't pay any attention to where he's at.  How do you not pay attention to your own husband?  Because we're not together.  But...  So you're not together.  No.  But we're still technically married.  Well, but if you're not together and you're not seeing each other, why is he so upset then?  I don't know.  So you're basically saying that, look, you guys are separated, so basically you're open 
[02:00:00]  game for any guy to come in and hit him.  Well, if you were separated and you weren't seeing each other, it would kind of mean that.  Tell him to beat it, then.  So basically you're saying the husband has no right to be here and be angry.  No.  But no, I'm also saying that she could not be telling the truth to get me to do that stuff.  Oh, she's a liar.  It could be that she's a liar.  I don't know who's telling the truth.  I don't know any of these people.  Your wife's a liar.  I don't know who's telling the truth.  Well, you've already said she's easy, and now you're calling her a liar.  I don't know who's telling the truth.  All right.  You said way too much already. 
[02:00:30]  I thought you'd just get the hell out of it before someone hurt you.  That's what I'm being made.  Leave.  Leave.  I'm telling you.  Fuck out.  Get the fuck out.  Oh, Jesus.  Just go.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe you're ahead again.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Keep running.  Don't stop to hit the outside.  He sure does know how to run out of the place.  There's one for the books.  All right.  We got to take a break.  Yeah, we got to.  Should we tell him?  We should tell him because we're going to find out during the break.  Let's bring him in. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, of course.  Now?  Yeah, because I don't know who to find out during the break.  Can't keep having him run out in the hallway.  Bring him in.  We know he stretched it out, but it was just kind of fun.  All right.  Bring David in.  He's like, no.  He was such a nervous wreck.  Oh, my God.  Was he scared?  Yeah, we did.  Yeah, we did.  I just wanted to make believe we didn't.  Oh, he was so scared.  Is this a joke?  He kept asking over and over again.  It's a joke.  Will you hold him?  Yeah.  All right.  Right. 
[02:01:30]  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  Just tell him.  Stop, stop.  David.  It's okay.  It's a real bad day.  Do you have something to say there, sir?  When it's least expected, you're elected.  You're the one to...  Am I supposed to talk?  Well, we're good.  He doesn't even know her.  No.  He doesn't?  He never met her before in his life.  That's what I was asking him before, and you were saying it was a husband. 
[02:02:00]  Yes, we were lying.  Yeah.  I said that.  I said that, and you said...  I said that, and you said...  I said that as a joke, and you said, no, it's a husband.  Yes.  We know.  Yes.  I asked you if it was a joke, and you said no.  Yes.  That's of course.  Why would we give it away?  So if I may ask the real question, who are you, by the way?  Are you just a random listener?  I'm random.  I'm a long-time listener.  Yeah.  Big fan of the show.  We didn't even know he could act as well.  Yeah.  I saw him run in. 
[02:02:30]  You looked like you could bring it in.  I'm like, oh, this guy.  Fuck, you didn't even know him.  He did a pretty good job.  Yeah, he was very good.  Thank you.  Thank you.  How about this?  To prove that everything is okay, how about each one of these gentlemen, in a sign of solidarity,  could each one of them perhaps suck one breast in tandem?  I think that's a lot of these are very fair.  Nice.  I'm a knee and ivory.  Go for it.  We got to figure out how to get that online, man.  Is she topless?  We can block our tips.  All right, we'll figure something out.  We'll just put house bolts in front of them.  I'm always thinking ahead of time.  Hold on. 
[02:03:00]  Can we have one person express to close this bit out?  Yeah.  Get over there, David.  I was really scared.  Yes, we know you were.  That was the beauty of it.  Don't get it, David.  He doesn't care.  He's a pervert.  He wants to suck her.  He's actually shaking the guy's hand.  I don't know who you are.  All right.  Go ahead.  Enjoy.  Come on.  Each one suck a tip.  Great.  It's great.  I love my life.  So cool.  There it is.  Look at that.  We can get along.  On one side, his dad would be disappointed, and on the other, hers would be disappointed. 
[02:03:30]  Should we get married?  Sure.  Okay, cool.  That guy was great.  What's your name, man?  You're here all the time.  Carlton.  Carlton.  That was fucking great.  Thank you.  He didn't break.  He didn't crack.  He didn't laugh.  I was laughing all the time.  All the time.  Yeah, he was very good.  Do you act or no?  No acting.  That was good.  All right.  Well, I guess we'll take a break, and we'll all jerk off on Lisa's tits.  Right.  I was leaving you for a while.  Yes, of course.  Really?  You were?  For a while.  For a while.  For a while.  The whole time you ran out.  I don't know. 
[02:04:00]  Jesus Christ.  Runaway train.  Running right off the track.  Runaway train.  Running right off the track.  Runaway train.  Running right off the track.  Yeah, the runaway train.  Running right off the track.  It's the worst.  Worst.  Of the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony with Sam and E-Rock. 
[02:04:30]  Sam, coming up after the break, you either love him or you hate him.  It's Eastside Dave.  I love Eastside Dave.  He's my radio co-host on Saturday nights, and he's a wild man.  He's totally unpredictable.  And in this next clip after the break, we forcibly shave his head.  Coming up next on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony with Sam and E-Rock.  Sam, you know, sometimes we don't plan on things to happen, but in the old facility  that we had, sometimes Eastside Dave would walk around and would catch Opie's eye, so  we'd have to bring him into studio. 
[02:05:00]  Well, of course, we'd bring him into studio, but that would be where the predictability  ended.  And I think this next bit that we're about to play is when we actually pinned him down,  didn't we?  Yeah.  And shaved the top of his head?  Not his whole head, just the top.  Is that what we did?  All right.  Yeah, we just shaved.  It was like a reverse mohawk.  Exactly.  We gave him the reverse mohawk and put him through bodily harm.  Yeah, he recently, I guess, another one of those bets that Ron and Fez do, and he had  his nipple pierced?  No, that was for the pilot.  Oh, that was for the pilot? 
[02:05:30]  It was for the TV show that he got his nipple pierced.  We decided to remove the piercing for him.  Whatever happened to that pilot?  It wasn't picked up, but I kissed a homeless man on it.  Fantastic.  I had the DVD, and you'll never see it.  I have it, too.  Why do you have it?  Because I got a copy.  For what?  You weren't asked to be on the show?  Archiving purposes.  You auditioned, and they said, no, thank you.  I know.  Wasn't fat enough.  I went to Pat Fumunaki.  What can I say?  I guess so.  Here it is.  Eastside Dave gets his head forcibly shaved.  It was part of Afro Wars on the worst of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:06:00]  Who the fuck is listening?  To the worst.  Who's fucking listening?  To the worst.  The worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  There he is.  Eastside Dave.  Dave was really getting the compliments yesterday.  I think we're going to let you sit with the boys today.  At the big boy table like on Thanksgiving.  It's the first time we've had Eastside Dave.  Are we playing your bit today?  I thought we'd come back strong from...  No!  Oh, boy. 
[02:06:30]  Watch his neck.  No!  Just watch his neck.  It's right there.  It's right there.  You really thought we'd let you sit with the...  Watch his neck.  You really thought...  More than it hurt me, Dave.  You really thought we would...  We...  Don't let him get away.  All right.  Don't let him get away.  He's scrambling.  You started the razor too soon.  Don't let him get away.  You really thought we were going to let you just sit at the grown-up table?  Grab his head, Danny. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, here he goes.  Kenny's got his hand.  Afro Wars.  Afro Wars is over.  It's over.  Kenny and Anthony.  Club sort of Kenny has a...  Kenny and Anthony.  Get on mic, Sam.  You're not hurting him, are you?  Kenny and Anthony.  Get on mic, Sam.  Let him choke.  No, let him breathe, Sam.  Let him breathe.  Look at that, baby.  You're breaking my fucking wrist.  All right.  All right, all right.  Don't hurt him.  Oh!  He's going to run.  He does this. 
[02:07:30]  He won't run.  What are you doing?  No, no.  Get him right down a little.  Get him down the middle.  No!  You got him.  You got him.  You lost.  You lost.  You lost.  You lost.  You lost.  Don't scream.  Afro Wars is officially over.  You got to go to Seaside, Dave.  Afro Wars is officially over.  Don't you spit on me.  I'll put a mask on you.  Don't you spit on me.  I spit on him.  You don't have it.  You don't fuck.  I'm on the street. 
[02:08:00]  You think you can trick me?  You don't fuck.  You think you can beat me?  I beat you again.  You don't fuck with a bull.  OB and Anthony, we're the better stuff.  He's taking nine guys to get me down.  He's taking nine guys.  We got your stunts.  We got your hair.  We got your plugs because Ronald Fizz is on from noon to three.  What do you got left, Dave?  Get out.  Let me see.  I'm going to wreck you a new asshole, Sam.  How's the haircut look?  I'm going to fuck you up.  How's the haircut look? 
[02:08:30]  How's the haircut?  You think you can play tricks on me, Dave?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That haircut looks awful.  Let me see, Dave.  That's fine.  Dave, let me see.  That's fine.  Dave, you're on my foot.  Dave, turn around.  I want to see your haircut.  I can't.  He's fucking holding my hand.  Turn around.  Oh, God.  It's just a big...  I still have an afro, in my opinion.  You don't have an afro.  This is an afro, Steve.  No, you're done.  No, this is still an afro.  Oh, absolutely.  This is an avant-garde afro.  Look at my fucking hair.  And you know what? 
[02:09:00]  I'm not shaving, bitches.  That's the fucking big joke on you.  Look at my hair.  It's still a fucking afro.  You put a couple bald spots in my head.  You didn't afro me down, bitchy.  I am going to go through life like this because this is still an afro.  Rob Fez doing a three-face.  Wait.  Turn around.  Turn around.  I just faced you.  Turn around.  You had eight guys to try and stop the bull.  Turn around.  And you still didn't properly execute a head shape.  I got more fucking hair. 
[02:09:30]  Let me see.  Nine, ten, ten people on 202.  Not me, Dave.  Look at this.  It doesn't matter.  This is still an afro, Mr. Opie.  You think there's enough hair on there?  No, no, no, no.  All right.  Well, get the razor back.  Get the back.  Get the back.  Get the back.  There you go.  Get the side.  Get the back.  Don't touch the sides.  Don't touch the sides.  Hey, get back the razor.  Hold his hands.  Jesus.  Now he's trying to poke out Danny's eyes with the razor. 
[02:10:00]  You let him get the razor.  He's like, Dave has the razor now.  Let go of the razor.  And the pressure will be released.  All right.  Wait, wait.  Just wait.  What are you, insane?  Dave doesn't play games.  No, Dave.  Get the bangs off.  Get the bangs off.  Wait, did he get the strip in the back?  All the way down to the back of the neck.  All the way to the back of the neck. 
[02:10:30]  You can't touch the bull.  The bull's going to fuck you up, Sam Roberts.  The bull's bald, Dave.  The bull's bald.  And we're just going to get it.  Wow.  It's taking fucking eight 300-pound security guards.  Yeah, but Dave, you...  And I'm still not down.  Your whole Ryder Fest crew tried to take me out on 57th Street.  You couldn't get the job done.  Pitsy, where the fuck are you, Pitsy?  The open answer show got the job done.  Hey, Pitsy!  Get over here!  He's copying and pasting in your office.  You fucking sons of bitches.  How do you like that?  You want to start?  I like that.  Get him.  Get this fucking guy. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, yeah.  Get this fucking guy.  Who is this guy?  Pitsy, get him.  Who is Pitsy?  Pitsy.  Pitsy.  All right.  Now he just pissed off Kenny.  Now he pissed off Kenny.  Now there's a bra.  Now there's a bra.  It's over, Dave.  I hit the feet because it's over.  Get the back of his head.  Get the back of his head.  Get the back of his head.  Sam, look out.  There we go.  Dave.  You've been beaten, Dave.  Come on.  Come on.  Don't get the ball. 
[02:11:30]  Dave, you were beaten.  Again.  Kenny's an animal.  Oh, he is.  My niple rink.  Get the back of his head.  Turn over, Dave.  I'm still good here.  Turn over.  Turn over, Dave.  I don't turn off for no play.  Ruffin through the three.  That's me, too.  Turn over.  Turn over for no one.  Ruffin through the three.  I ask you politely to remove the fish from my throat.  You guys are fucking with the bull, baby.  Afro Wars is over, Dave.  Afro Wars ain't over shit. 
[02:12:00]  Afro Wars is officially over.  I owe my $500 for the biggest gator competition.  Whatever happened.  That's right.  Actually, yeah.  Do me a favor.  I haven't shaved down there in a while.  Wait.  You guys think shaving my crutch is a fucking joke on me, you fucking faggots.  Now we got to explain.  Like, the Ron and Fez crew tried to get Sam on the street, right?  What happened, Sam?  What happened?  What happened?  You and Pence, there were nine interns down on 57th Street that tried to assault me.  Throw me into a plate glass window.  Drunk Irishman, his name was Mooch. 
[02:12:30]  Throw me into a plate glass window.  Throw me down on the pavement.  You are a chronic liar, Sam Roberts.  And you got no hair off my head.  You didn't get one strand of beautiful curly hair off my hair.  Oh, you are a lying sack of shit.  You're going to go down hard.  So we've been planning this the entire vacation.  The whole time, baby.  You thought you were coming in here.  I've got to explain all this, because all hell broke loose for the last 20 minutes.  And we invited Eastside Dave to the adult table.  We allowed him to sit with us. 
[02:13:00]  With us!  His head is bleeding.  Like that.  Oh, my God.  He thought he was privileged.  He thought we were going to talk about the pilot we filmed yesterday for Comedy Central.  And quite frankly, Eastside Dave was a star, yes.  And he thought he was coming in here to talk about that.  And we ambushed him.  And we completed Afro Wars by shaving his head.  It didn't count!  Remember, Dave?  Afro Wars by the single honor.  You started these sneaky tactics, Dave.  No, no, no.  This is your own.  That was fun and games.  This is fun and games, baby. 
[02:13:30]  This is the end of the game.  Game over, Dave.  Just a fucking parade of 300-pound men dragging the bull down.  The horns are coming out, Sam Roberts.  The horns are out, and they've pinned you down to the floor, Dave.  I wish I could talk, but Clipsaw and Kenny's cock is two inches from my mouth.  You started this, Dave.  No, we're done.  No, we're not done.  Dave, you started it.  We ended it.  He's sitting on my fucking nipple ring that I did for your television show. 
[02:14:00]  Can you please let him off my nipple ring?  Oh, God.  It's going to be infected with sweat.  I thought we were piercing your ball bag for the TV show.  The guy wouldn't do it.  Oh, he wouldn't do it?  No, I was willing to do it, because the bull's always willing to do it.  All right, sit up.  If you go after anyone, though, you're done.  Oh, we really need to get the back of your head.  Will you let that?  He looks silly.  All right, sit down.  Sit down.  Sit down.  You use that mic.  I can't talk in my mic, because Dave was drooling and spitting on it while he was talking. 
[02:14:30]  All right, Dave.  The haircut is terrific.  Actually, it's perfect how it is.  Danny did a great job.  It's perfect.  What are you picking up?  He's trying to stick it back on.  You can't stick your hair back on.  Afro Wars is over.  You never said, I can't continue the war.  It's over.  It's over.  It's not over.  I got hair.  No, you don't.  I got hair.  Look what he's doing.  He's staring back on his head.  Did you just put it on my head?  I have a wonderful head of hair on my shoulders. 
[02:15:00]  You guys tried to get Sam to lose Afro Wars by, you were in cahoots.  You were, like, doing some top secret shit.  You convinced Fez, you convinced Fez.  I don't know what you're talking about.  You convinced him.  I have my incestors.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Because Fez wouldn't do a thing like that.  There's a rambling, crazy Irishman by the name of Mooch decided to take you.  It was all fun and games.  It wasn't nine security.  Oh, Sam.  There was Dave. 
[02:15:30]  There was Mooch.  There was Pepper.  I didn't even touch you.  There was Pitsy.  There was some random.  Dave, can you take the fake hair off your head before you put your headphones on?  Where's the glue?  Pitsy, where's the glue, Pitsy?  There's no glue.  There's no glue.  I need to ask you one question.  I'm looking at a picture that E-Rock took where Kenny's pretty much choking you out.  Your color, is that from your alcoholism or because of the lack of air going to your head?  It's both, buddy.  All right.  Because you're a little blue there.  Someone bring Dave some glue.  He's asking for some glue.  Do you want glue, really? 
[02:16:00]  I really appreciate the help of Gras and Pits at this moment.  Do you want glue to try to glue it back on?  Yeah.  Because you have to work.  Look, I don't quit.  You might think this is over.  It's not.  Ron Fisk, noon to three.  You can tape it to my head.  You can do whatever you want.  That means the Afro War continues.  Dave, you don't have to quit to be defeated.  Here is what, how you would have beaten me.  You got beat.  I didn't get beat.  Dave, Dave.  It's going to have luscious hair in the back.  People are saying he looks like Clint Towers.  Hey, the guy was in Apollo 13.  Let us give you a movie. 
[02:16:30]  Good for Best Picture.  Great movie.  How about we do this?  Now that Afro Wars is over, how about we give you the Clint Howard?  The Afro Wars does not end.  It's over.  Until one of us says, I decline.  How about we give you the Clint Howard?  With the long hair on the sides, I think it would be a great look for you.  I'll do a Clint Howard, only if you concede that the Afro Wars continues.  How does it continue?  Well, Dave, you're...  Because I have a back afro.  No, you know, we took that out, too, for the most part.  Gabe Kapler had a back afro. 
[02:17:00]  Gabe Kapler.  Dave's wife is stepping up and saying, where's the money for the weight gain contest?  I, Opie owes me 500 clams.  I don't know about no weight gain contest.  We're not talking about some weird weight gain contest.  Yeah, I don't remember that one.  Oh, boy.  I don't remember the weight gaining contest.  We could get in trouble for welshing on that one.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't remember actually doing that contest.  I remember we were talking about doing it.  So let's admit, then, if you are willing to admit that Eastside Dave of Ron Fez Noon to  3 defeated the entire staff of Opie and Anthony 6 to Noon.  What about the... 
[02:17:30]  In the biggest gainer?  What about the plug for the guys that put you on TV?  I just said Eastside 6 to Noon.  You didn't mention the show.  Comedy Central.  I wasn't sure what we could say and what we couldn't say.  I was trying to protect you guys.  You're smarter than dumb Sam.  I think I know what trade I want to make now.  Hey, Sam, tell us what you did on the show.  And then he gives the whole plot of the fucking TV show that no one's supposed to know about.  I just talked about kissing that guy.  He's like, there's teams and this and that and points and...  Points?  If you guys are willing to concede that I, in fact, won the biggest gainer... 
[02:18:00]  They're now calling you Eastside Larry Fine.  Steven asked from Bayshore.  Sorry.  One-third of the greatest comedy troupe of all time.  Thanks for the compliment.  Can we give you the Clint Howard now?  If you concede that, I win the biggest gainer.  This way, it's a stalemate.  Oh, by the way, I got your wedding ring.  So, what happened?  What are we going to do now?  Come on.  Now, you...  Let that happen.  You know.  Did you lose that?  What happened?  They took it off my finger when one of 15 people grappled me. 
[02:18:30]  In pandemonium.  Pandemonium.  Ram Shackle Jackson or whatever.  No, you left it at the Bard Comics last night.  No.  When we were doing the little party after we were done.  Oh, don't you ever say that.  Did you do that?  I was home at 8.15.  My wife could verify that shit.  Yeah, but the shoot ended at 4.  We all know that.  It didn't.  You're lying.  Oh, my God.  Is your forehead bleeding? 
[02:19:00]  Yes, it's bleeding.  It's bleeding because I'm a fighter.  Fighters bleed.  I'm bald fighting, Mr. Anthony.  You sure did put up a big fight.  This is a nice...  You got hair in your mouth?  It's a nice ring.  I got hair all over the place.  You got hair.  Can we give you the Clint Howard?  You want us to at least clean it up a little bit for you?  I want to admit that I took the entire staff of you guys down for biggest gainer.  If you guys want to admit victory, then it's a stalemate.  And then more wars can continue.  But let's admit that I took the biggest gainer competition because I'm not going out here 
[02:19:30]  a loser because I believe I won that.  Hey, Butcher, you still in the biggest gainer?  Fuck yeah.  Eh, there you go.  Oh, okay.  Fuck you, you sidekick.  I'm having a child in a month.  You need money, don't you?  I need this $500.  And I need the title at this point.  You want your ring back?  I'd love that.  Can we just clean up your hair a little bit?  Is there any way we can listen to this?  What?  Wait a minute.  God damn it.  I love you so much, Mr. A.  You're a fucking great person. 
[02:20:00]  Pure and simple.  I don't care what those fucking...  Whoa!  Hey!  Fucking...  Whatever.  That's a fucking...  You're a fucking good guy.  Ron Fez.  Okay?  Noon to three.  But O&A.  Awesome.  Six to noon.  And...  That's a fucking...  Uh, no.  I got no call.  Call you, MP.  I got a call.  Call you, Mr. C. 
[02:20:30]  Or Mr. A.  And that's what I got calls to do.  And I'm saying right now,  Fucking love you.  Love you, man.  Alright.  Love you.  Have a good vacation.  Bye-bye.  These are the types of calls we get.  I got one more.  You're making drunk calls to Anthony?  Yeah.  Here's one more.  God damn it.  I love you so much.  I love you so much, dude. 
[02:21:00]  You have no fucking idea.  You're the man.  Oh, Jesus.  I love Ron Fez, too.  Jesus Christ.  Ron Fez.  Noon to three.  Hope you're happy.  Fucking six to noon.  Let's fucking rock and roll, bitch.  It's fucking St. Patrick's Day.  I'm calling for one person, Mr. A. 
[02:21:30]  Mr. A.  Mr. A.  Tell him that I love him.  Pure and simple.  I love Mr. A.  I love that fucking Jimmy Norton, too.  I was just about to get hurt.  Yeah, I love Ron Fez.  All right.  I'm going to pass out.  I would love to go.  Shit.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Bitch.  Yeah, fuck.  I spilled the beer.  I'm going to hell.  You're going to spit sir.  Such a fucking whore.  Spit sir.  Hey, you know.  I'm spit sir. 
[02:22:00]  You know.  Whatever.  Fuck.  Yeah, whatever.  Spit sir.  Yeah.  I'll be calling it A.  No, I'm just two or two bitches.  There you go.  Oh, that's.  Wow.  That's.  Those are some of the messages that I received over vacation from Dave.  I don't see anything wrong with those.  No, why would you?  A man calling another man with affection in his heart.  It's so funny.  I loved getting those messages.  I felt true love from those messages. 
[02:22:30]  I need to check into rehab now.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  With your head shaved like that, they'll take you in a second.  Yeah.  This is a lunatic.  I got a bed waiting for you now.  Does your wife encourage you to stop drinking?  Yeah.  Definitely the cut down.  Yeah.  Definitely the cut down.  Yeah.  I'm trying.  I'm sticking with the once a week thing.  Problem is, sometimes once a week, then that makes me want to drink just as much as  possible, and then phone calls like that are made.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Here's your ring.  I'm not messing with your ring. 
[02:23:00]  Thank you.  See, look.  Look, I'm a nice guy.  See?  That's class.  It's personified right there.  Barely.  Personified.  Personified.  I love fucking Dave.  So, in the end, we admit that it's a stalemate.  Because, I mean.  No, you lost Afro Wars.  I think Sam could officially cut his hair now.  You started this, Dave.  We beat you at your own game.  How is this not an Afro?  Dude, we beat you.  There's no hair in the middle.  Dave, focus.  Yeah.  We beat you at your own game once again. 
[02:23:30]  No.  You started this, like, behind the scenes.  I'm going to try to, like, make him lose.  Right.  And we didn't forget.  Yeah.  And then.  I remember being dragged into this competition.  You took the honor out of the competition.  I remember being dragged into it.  And now, to get serious, you were a star yesterday.  Fucking Comedy Central thinks you're the real fucking deal.  I did that for Ronald Fez, noon to three.  No, you did it for Opie and Anthony's TV show.  You've got to, like, start separating yourself, my friend.  I separate nothing. 
[02:24:00]  But you were doing stuff that they didn't even tell you to do.  What did you do?  You drank the, give us the list of things you did for the show yesterday.  For the pilot.  They cut off Big A's eyebrows, and they were pulling them in a cup with water, and I grabbed  the cup out of the guy's hand and drank it.  And it had the eyebrows, the greasy Big A eyebrows.  Yeah, it was disgusting Big A, and I nearly threw up.  There was grease in the cup, even though it was just water, shaving cream, and eyebrows,  and you drank that whole thing.  That was horrifying.  And then this one comedian was eating apples and spitting them into my mouth. 
[02:24:30]  You're doing, like, a baby bird feeding.  Yeah, but it would have been fun, like, two or three apples, but he did 15 fucking apples  on the street, and I started to throw up.  And then I started to almost throw up the apples back in his mouth while he was doing  it, so that was a horrifying thing.  And then it ended with a nipple piercing?  I got a nipple pierced.  Thank you, yeah.  Wow.  I don't know exactly how it's going to come out.  I'm like, okay, can I take it out now?  They're like, no, just keep it in there for a while. 
[02:25:00]  Did it hurt?  Yeah, it hurt like hell.  We wanted to get his ball bag pierced, but they wouldn't do it.  No.  They wouldn't do it.  Why wouldn't they?  Not the champ.  The champ was willing to do it in a heartbeat.  Why wouldn't they do it?  It was downtown and everything.  Everything goes down there.  No, the guy actually asked the guy, they're like, so will you pierce his balls?  He's like, I pierced only one ball before, and the man had to go to the hospital.  Oh, really?  I'm not going to do that again.  Yeah, so we're like, okay.  I finally figured out something you will not do.  What's that? 
[02:25:30]  You've eaten your own shit.  You've done it all.  Yeah.  You really have done it all.  I'm going to give you props now, but you will not get a Prince Albert.  I was just...  That's the only thing you probably wouldn't do.  God, that's a piercing through the tip of your dick, through the hole in your dick,  out through the bottom of your dick, and then you put like a barbell through it.  Get a photo of a Prince Albert.  I mean, they're done.  Yeah.  I mean, we won't even get a...  Who's this fucking Prince Albert that is named after him?  I know.  That it's named after him.  And he's a fucking food in a can.  Yeah. 
[02:26:00]  He's a fucking hole through the cock and bad food.  That's how it stinks.  Yeah, I don't think you'll do a Prince Albert.  We're trying to find you one.  And we won't get into the dick slicing and all that, because now we're getting a little  too far.  That's crazy.  A little too far.  But as far as relatively normal shit, I think that's the only thing you wouldn't do.  Well, the penis is a sensitive area for me.  I've had problems with it before.  Have you?  Although I was willing to do a catheter on this program.  Yeah, that's true.  What problems do you have?  What? 
[02:26:30]  Certain issues.  Fever blisters is what I call them.  You have fever blisters on your penis.  You fucking started talking about this yesterday in between, like...  That's an old problem.  In between stuff we were filming.  I have a little Veltrix.  Can't cure.  Oh, you got to verify?  No.  It was honestly...  I swear to God.  I have very sensitive skin.  And I get into...  I break out with the hives a lot.  Yeah.  And I swear to God, because the doctor said that it's not herpetic.  And I wouldn't have ever used... 
[02:27:00]  Remember that word had he not told that to me.  Right.  But, um...  Some are debating that.  Yeah, the guy tested for everything.  And did he give you Veltrix?  Why the Veltrix then?  Why Veltrix?  Because he said it would cure...  It would be the same symptoms.  It would alleviate the same symptoms.  So it's just like herpes, except it's not herpes.  It isn't, though.  Because I get, like, the hives on the side of my body and, like, my forehead.  Right.  But have you been tested, blood tested for herpes?  Yes.  Yes.  Do you have any herpes antibodies?  No.  Or any antibodies? 
[02:27:30]  No, I don't.  Okay.  You saw there's your Prince Albert.  Oh!  That's the only thing I could think of that you wouldn't do.  Never.  That looks like it could do some permanent damage.  That's part of...  That's, like, part of the normal world.  I mean, we could go further with this stuff.  But as far as, like, things you would do and not do, that's the only thing I could think  of right there.  Who would want that?  I don't know.  Oh, just look at that.  It looks like it would be fun.  That's the only thing.  And I'm not even trying to convince you.  There's no...  I gotta think about it.  That's all.  Oh, boy.  Oh, that looks so painful. 
[02:28:00]  If you're gonna do it, wait for this TV show to be picked up.  We could do five, seven minutes on this one.  You lost Afro Wars.  How does it feel?  I don't feel like I did.  You can't continue, Dave.  I don't feel like I did.  But, Dave, I understand...  You lost, Dave.  I understand your spunk or whatever, but it's over.  You can't continue now.  I mean, how did I lose?  I was grabbed by a multitude of...  Security men. 
[02:28:30]  Did you come in here on your own?  You weren't smart enough.  See, you gotta, like, get that brain smart, too.  Right.  I'm not the most intelligent key in the box.  All you gotta do is stay out of the studio and we wouldn't have got you.  You walked into your own trap, my friend.  Right.  I don't know what that meant, but...  What about the biggest gainer?  Yeah, right?  I won that competition.  It was supposed to be over by now.  Pat Duffy would do a Prince Albert, by the way.  You know, the guy that's been in the stunts.  He would. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know, though, but eating his own shit.  My own feces is better than rushing...  That was crazy.  The guy went to the hospital, having hot sauce, put up his ass from a semi-celebrity.  He's got fucking herpes.  Kidding, Jay, come on.  He's got herpes.  Fever blisters.  He's got herpes.  Fever blisters.  Fucking Tabasco up the assholes, nothing of this kid.  Genital hives.  Genital hives.  That's as high as they call it.  Oh, my God.  Let's see.  Did you show the pal talkers maybe they haven't seen the hair yet? 
[02:29:30]  Oh, no.  They've been looking at it.  Believe me, I've had...  No, take the fucking duct tape off.  You look silly.  You try to duct tape the hair back.  Look at that.  Let me get a good...  Save that for Ron and Fez.  Back to it here.  I'll go to six.  I mean, if I have the hair, it's the same thing as, you know, Marv Albert.  Everyone says what a nice afro he has.  Right.  I mean, if I tape hair on my head, it's the same thing as Mr. Albert.  Did we get a nice for you in the middle there?  You want us to clean it up a little bit?  It's like the reverse mohawk if you're trying to figure this out at home.  Yeah. 
[02:30:00]  Okay.  It's a new kind of afro.  What do you want me to say?  Like Terry Bradshaw.  Yeah, turn around.  Like, look that way.  So there you go.  There's the back.  You can just stay right there for a minute.  Let me get a good view.  It's better that we didn't take the mohawk all the way down to the back of the neck.  There's like a whole clump of hair still there.  Hey, Tom Hagen.  Someone says, when did Louis C.K. come in?  Oh, that's good.  Louis C.K. 
[02:30:30]  Dave, you fell for our trap.  I'm disappointed.  Oh, I didn't fall for anything.  I came in here.  I fought like a champion.  I still have plenty of good hair on my back.  You did fight.  Yeah, but this was a competition about the hair on your head, and that's gone.  No, no, no.  It's not.  You can't.  Right here.  You can't continue.  Stop trying to put the hair back.  It's not going to work.  Admit that I defeated everyone with the big gainer, and then I'll go quietly.  It's a stalemate.  Get the fucking scale in here.  Admit that I beat Popeye Jones or whatever that fucking name was. 
[02:31:00]  Popeye Jones.  Butcher, have you been training?  I'm still fat, yeah.  I will do this.  If you have gained more weight than Butcher to this day, I will admit the feat.  Okay.  Do we have the numbers?  Maybe.  Oh, boy.  Where is Than?  Than is sick today.  Is Than all right?  Than?  Than will be okay.  What happened?  Got struck right.  Oh. 
[02:31:30]  See, I'd rather have that than someone with herpes.  Fever blisters?  Fever blisters.  Fever blisters, that's what they are.  Gentle eyes.  For sensitive skin.  Exactly.  What was your starting weight?  195.  Are you lying?  No.  No.  All right.  And Butcher, come on in here.  Biggest gainer was a contest that kind of never took off.  And we forgot to tell the participants that we really didn't want to do it.  Yeah.  All it resulted in is me having now an eating problem. 
[02:32:00]  Now he's addicted to food.  At like 1 o'clock in the morning, I'm like, I really need some Doritos.  I wonder why.  I hope you lose this contest because of the hair we just took off your head.  Yeah, it puts him under by an ounce.  Put it back on, then.  He put it back on.  You can't put your hair back on.  He put it back on his head.  I don't think anyone will notice the difference.  I really don't.  Please, like, fix that nice for the Ron and Fez show today, noon to three.  Like, get it all glued back in place nice. 
[02:32:30]  Don't sneeze on us.  No, it's just the hair.  All right.  And Butcher, what was your starting weight?  I think Butcher was 208.  All right, 208.  If you beat Butcher right now, I will admit defeat.  But my boy Butcher has got you beat on this contest, too.  No, you go first, please.  What?  Look at the thing.  He's just a mess.  Oh, fuck you, Dave.  Dave, it is so done.  Wait. 
[02:33:00]  I'm 224.6.  No way.  Yeah.  You started at what time?  208.  What time?  Dave, you're done.  208 is how many pounds?  16.  16 pounds you have to beat.  So what was your starting weight?  195.  My starting weight was 195.  195.  So you need to hit 211.  211.  And I will admit defeat.  Or better.  211 or better.  Wait.  There was a point in there, wasn't there?  I might need the point.  Point six.  Point six.  So you've got to beat 211.6. 
[02:33:30]  Yes.  I'm keeping this.  211.  By the way, I must say, I think this contest was supposed to end officially April 1st.  211.6.  Oh, yeah.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Stop moving.  Yeah, bitches.  212.2.  The champion.  Wow.  And the stalemates.  What?  212.2.  Wow.  What?  Fucking pound.  He said that he pulls it out.  I'm a shitter.  Now, admit that I am sometimes the champ. 
[02:34:00]  Sometimes I take a loss.  Yeah.  Sometimes I take a loss when eight fucking security guards bring me down.  What'd you do?  You couldn't eat a little more?  What the way?  Would you have a salad, you asshole?  Yeah, yeah.  I'll admit defeat.  I'll admit defeat.  I'll admit defeat.  Wait, he beat us by .4?  It was fucked up, man.  Wow.  He admits defeat.  Wait.  Contest is over.  That could be the hair.  And it won the 100 pounds, Opie.  That could be the hair.  Get back on there.  Take the hair off your head.  The champion wins.  Take the hair off your head. 
[02:34:30]  Look at the hair.  And stop drinking water.  I think I was born yesterday.  No, no, no.  Okay.  Drink that.  I do.  But you drink the water now.  This is over.  Drink the water.  Drink the water.  This is over.  It's the guy in the defeat.  Get back on that scale.  Can't hold the bottle.  He's holding the bottle, Jimmy Norton, to point out.  I lost weight.  He's drinking AIDS, you fucking asshole.  He's drinking my gentle huts.  All right.  The scale's fucked up. 
[02:35:00]  I think they've...  The scale's fucked up, so we're going to have to call this a draw.  No.  He admitted defeat.  I'm the champ.  All right.  Well, Steve, what are you doing?  Oh, he's stepping on the buttons.  Yeah, he's getting nervous.  Steve doesn't know what he's doing.  No, because you took the hair off your head, and now you're getting nervous.  That's how you executive produce.  Now you're getting nervous.  Now, what does it say?  2.12.4.  So give me some more weights. 
[02:35:30]  Add me some more.  Give me some more fucking victory.  Oh, I love the victory.  I love being a champ.  It's hard not to be a champion, and I am one.  Yeah.  So I'm going to take my champion, and you might have a slight victory in Sam Roberts.  Maybe I'll concede now.  I am a champion.  But we have a stalemate, part champ.  I'm at least 50% champion.  I'm going to take that to my grave.  50% champion.  Thank you.  50% champion, huh?  And I am the biggest gainer champion for Ryan Fez, noon to three.  Soon to be full-time on the Opie and Anthony TV show. 
[02:36:00]  I don't know what you're talking about.  Yeah.  Now, can someone remove this?  That really hurts.  You want us to remove it?  With pliers.  If you know what you're doing.  Yeah, we know what you're doing.  Who knows what they're doing?  You guys know what you're doing.  You can do it right now.  Get the pliers.  You can't pull it through like that.  What is it?  A barbell?  Kenny, you know what you're doing, right?  Kenny knows.  Unscrew one side of the barbell, right?  Yeah, Kenny knows.  Let Kenny do it.  You have some alcohol, too, right?  Yeah.  What?  Kenny knows what he's doing.  Do you need a drink? 
[02:36:30]  No, that's a...  Gotcha.  All right, take your shirt off.  Another bed.  Take your shirt off.  Kenny knows what he's doing.  Don't.  That's not pliers.  That's a knife.  You can't cut it out.  Jesus, Kenny.  Will you just take your shirt off?  We're good at this stuff.  He's not going to come near me with a knife.  I don't think he...  I put it away.  All right, listen.  So we're getting a lot done here.  You lost Afro Wars.  You cheated and won Biggest Gainer.  No, I won Biggest Gainer, fair and square.  I want my 500 clams, Mr. Opie. 
[02:37:00]  I'm done.  No, just the one.  No!  What's wrong?  He's grabbing my nipple.  Well, let him do it.  So what?  Let him do what?  You look like an orangutan.  No!  Okay, all right.  All right, all right.  Do you like it?  Do you like it?  No, I don't.  I don't like it.  I like it very much.  You like it more than you?  Ow!  You got an angle on this.  All right, let's just get the piercing out of his nipple.  Thank you, guys.  Kenny, are you going to do it?  Nah, I don't. 
[02:37:30]  Who could do it?  E-Rock?  Steve?  Steve, you got piercings all over your body.  Yeah, my ears.  Huh?  My ears, I have piercings.  My rears.  My rears.  Somebody's volunteering from the stand.  Oh, that's safe.  That's one of the listers in the bleachers.  Well, that's good.  I'm not going to.  That's please.  202 employees only.  No offense.  Sam, you want to do it?  Now that you're gay, you'd probably enjoy that.  I'm not gay.  I just want Afro Wars.  Why can't I have a little bit of glory? 
[02:38:00]  You want Jack and shit.  What are you talking about?  You just admitted defeat to Afro Wars.  Sean M. is noticing from Monroe, New Jersey, that I sound like one of the Duke brothers.  Turn those machines back on!  You're the only one who saw Trading Places?  Turn them back on!  All right, we got Travis's wife. 
[02:38:30]  We'll take out the piercing for you.  Really?  Yeah.  Okay, I mean, with your hands?  I need to see it.  Is it like a normal barbell?  Uh, yeah.  Make it hurt.  No, please don't make it hurt, Travis's wife.  I would never.  That is one-sixth man.  He looks like an orangutan.  He really does.  Wow, he really does.  You got some orange hair, bro.  Okay, come here.  Oh, Jesus.  Do you know what you're doing here?  Yes.  Okay.  Don't touch her.  Don't touch.  I can't look, though. 
[02:39:00]  No.  Dardy and screwing.  I'm going to pull.  Ready?  Yeah.  Okay, ready?  Yep.  I bet he was, his skin was healing around it.  He's squeezing it.  Oh, it's bleeding, though.  All right, get some alcohol.  I think I need alcohol.  Yeah, you do.  Make sure it's safe.  Is it bleeding?  Don't drink the alcohol.  Steve comes in with Budweiser. 
[02:39:30]  How many days into the drinking challenge are you with?  Since I called Mr. Anthony over here.  Since St. Patrick's Day.  I guess so, huh?  You're not allowed to drink?  Not until someone bails?  Mooch or Pepper Hicks bails.  All right, so if you keep, uh...  Or Pitsy.  Yeah, all right.  All right, get out of here.  Thank you, guys, and you can watch the champion walk away.  Ron Fez, noon to three.  The biggest gainer champion.  Yeah.  Afro Wars champion right here.  Biggest gainer champ.  Afro Wars. 
[02:40:00]  Biggest gainer champ.  Afro Wars champion of 202.  Biggest gainer champ.  Sure, the biggest gainer champ will take some photos with the fans.  With the fans.  Is he the best?  Who's better than Dave?  The worst.  It's the worst.  Of the O.P. and Anthony show.  It's the worst of O.P. and Anthony with Sam and E-Rock.  Sam, after the break, who is Larry Sinclair?  Larry Sinclair is the man who says he had oral sex with President Obama.  Did he or didn't he?  He called into the O.P. and Anthony show to answer those questions. 
[02:40:30]  Stay tuned.  It's the worst of the O.P. and Anthony show.  You're listening to the worst, the worst of O.P. and Anthony.  It's the worst of O.P. and Anthony.  I am E-Rock.  He is primetime Sam Roberts.  That's right.  Of course you know who he is, but I have to introduce myself because not everybody knows  who I am.  Correct.  So we do this thing here.  We have Larry Sinclair on the phone.  Who is Larry Sinclair, Sam?  Well, we here at the O.P. and Anthony show get all the big guests, and when a news story  breaks, we get the people who are involved to comment. 
[02:41:00]  Larry Sinclair is the man who put out a YouTube video saying that he had shared drugs with  then-Senator Barack Obama and also received oral sex from him.  I find this a little hard to believe.  Well, we got him on the phone, and when put to the question, he came off as quite believable.  Interesting.  Larry Sinclair on the worst of the O.P. and Anthony show.  Didn't he call you, too?  What?  This sucks cattle dick!  You're listening to the worst of O.P. and Anthony. 
[02:41:30]  You're failure!  Fail!  Yes!  We could get Larry Sinclair on the phone.  Let's get him, of course.  Are you up for a Larry Sinclair interview?  I certainly am.  You know who Larry Sinclair is?  He's the one that went on YouTube and claimed that he blew Obama.  He blew Obama, and Obama bought cocaine for him and crack for himself, meaning Obama.  And he did it numerous times or something.  Do we have that clip?  We should replay it before we get Larry on the phone.  I heard a crazy rumor that John McCain is so old, he once owned Barack Obama's great-great-grandfather. 
[02:42:00]  I don't know how this shit gets started, but it's just wrong.  All right, this is Larry Sinclair, Jeffrey.  Listen to this claim that he made.  Do we have the...  I want the XM version.  Okay, good.  Here it is.  Larry Sinclair.  We're going to get him on the phone in a minute here.  Hi, my name is Larry Sinclair.  I'm making this video and posting it on YouTube because of an incident involving myself and 
[02:42:30]  Senator Barack Obama between November 3rd and November 8th, 1999, in the Chicago, Illinois  area.  The mainstream media and Obama himself has done greatly to prevent this story from becoming  public.  During those time periods in 1999, I met Obama at an upscale lounge in Chicago, Illinois.  After having a few drinks, Obama and I left in my limo, began to drink. 
[02:43:00]  Mr. Obama acquired powder cocaine for my use, crack cocaine for his use.  I performed oral sex on Senator Obama, who at the time was a state representative for the  state of Illinois.  Mr. Obama knows these allegations to be true.  I'm challenging Mr. Obama to come forth, be honest, stop claiming that his drug use  is limited to his teenage years.  1999, you weren't a teenager.  1999, you were state representative for the people of the state of Illinois. 
[02:43:30]  1999, I performed oral sex on you in the back of my limo, as well as in my hotel room,  in Gurney, Illinois, two days later.  In Gurney.  If you challenge this, the authenticity of this allegation, I challenge you to take a  polygraph test, as I will submit to as well.  These allegations are true and need to be told to the public.  Let the public decide whether Mr. Obama is being forthright and honest. 
[02:44:00]  Thank you.  There he is.  Larry Sinclair.  How great is that?  Larry Sinclair.  He believes what he's saying.  It's a douche.  Which I think could be his own mental issues.  I like that.  1999.  Yeah.  Oh, here's Larry.  Where's Jimmy?  It sounds like he thinks it happened in his head.  I mean, he sounds wrong.  Oh, yeah.  That sounds authentic.  Maybe it really happened.  Yeah.  Mr. Sinclair.  Yes.  It's a pleasure to have you on the Opie and Anthony radio show.  How are you, sir?  I'm going crazy in Washington, D.C. 
[02:44:30]  But other than that, I'm fine.  Why are you going crazy in Washington, D.C.?  Well, I'm just trying to get some things done and get some things addressed.  And what would that be, sir?  I'm basically trying to get someone to ask the questions to Barack Obama and stop tiptoeing  around this self-proclaimed Democratic nominee.  Why do you think he's, I mean, the answer seems obvious, but why do you think he's denying  this and nobody is approaching you for more information? 
[02:45:00]  Perhaps the Republican Party would, boy, they would revel in this.  Well, actually, it's not that he's denying it because he hasn't denied it.  Not unless you call what his San Juan Puerto Rican attorney, Andreas W. Lopez, went on Puerto  Rican television claiming as a denial, but the campaign has not denied anything.  In fact, they have made very specific intent not to deny anything.  Wow.  And as far as asking me why other people are not approaching me, actually, I spent the 
[02:45:30]  last week interviewing and documenting things with quite a few people.  So let me ask, I don't mean, I missed the beginning.  So you, they talked about the oral sex already?  No, not yet.  We didn't dip right into that.  He's in Washington trying to get things done right now.  Okay, so now you had a limo and Obama went to cop drugs.  Now, you say you performed oral sex on him in the back.  That's correct.  How many times did you give him head? 
[02:46:00]  Gave him head twice.  Once in the limo, once in the hotel room.  But this isn't about the sex.  This is more about the fact that he did the drugs, he bought the drugs, and he's been  lying about it ever since.  Well, it's also about the sex.  Well, yeah.  Because to be a presidential candidate who's a homosexual, that is something to be spoken  about.  How big's his cock?  No comment.  No?  Why would you just say that?  You admit blowing him.  How big's his cock?  Yeah.  No comment.  Is it big?  Is it fat?  Most black guys have fat, big dicks.  I got notes for you.  This is a wannabe black man with a white boy's dick. 
[02:46:30]  Oh.  No.  Oh, damn.  No, you didn't.  Uh-uh.  Oh, yes, I did.  You're saying he's basically a small, thin cock that you sucked in the back of a limo?  I'm not giving any details on that one right now, sir, because I'm actually meeting with  some attorneys and with some journalists here to get this out.  Oh, you want to go to the Times with the fact that he has a small dick?  Did he cum in your mouth?  Yes.  He did.  What did you do with it?  Are you a cum eater?  Never mind.  Well, did you swallow it or spit it out? 
[02:47:00]  Come on, guys.  Are we going to be serious about this?  No, we are.  This is satellite radio.  Yeah, this is an in-depth interview.  We wanted to get a little more information than the normal outlets are getting.  Oh, no.  Sorry.  I had to tell.  No.  That's fine.  We can get it in depth, but I want to try to keep it as clean at the same time.  Okay.  When the man put the rice pudding in your mouth, did you eat it or spit it out the limo window?  I'm not a spitter.  All right.  All right.  That's good.  All right.  That's a good boy.  All right.  Next question for the senator from Alabama. 
[02:47:30]  Did Obama have, like, a freckle or anything on his penis that way?  I cannot comment on those things right now, guys.  Why?  I really can't.  Wait, hold on.  If you tell him the truth and you gave this presidential candidate a blowjob in the back  of a limo, why is it out of line to ask if there was any definable features?  I did not say it was out of line to ask me.  You're screaming.  No, I'm not screaming.  Sorry.  I did not say it was out of line to ask me that question.  I said I cannot answer that question for you right now because of what I am involved in 
[02:48:00]  here in D.C.  Okay.  All right.  You know, Fez, you've been on our show for 10 minutes and you haven't said Ron and Fez  new to three.  What?  No, this isn't.  What?  No, this is Larry Sinclair.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Larry Sinclair.  I got a little confused there.  Here's a question.  Is he cut or uncut?  I will not answer that question at this time either.  Why not?  Why?  What are you doing?  Does he have like a soft mushroom head?  Pending litigation? 
[02:48:30]  Pending litigation.  There is some litigation, but right now I truly am meeting with some journalists and  some attorneys here.  Larry!  Larry!  We are definitely trying to get this addressed today or tomorrow.  Right.  It is out and open.  So you went on YouTube.  Hold on.  Hold on.  How much coke did he do?  Can you say that or did you decide?  Actually, he smoked exactly two rocks in the limo and I believe another two in the hotel  room.  So you can give out the exact amount of cocaine he did, but not whether his cock had skin 
[02:49:00]  on the tip of it?  That's not what I said.  I didn't say I could not give you that.  I said I could not answer that at this time.  Why?  Why?  Well, that's the difference.  I can't give you that.  I can't.  You're playing semantics.  I mean...  No, sir.  I'm not playing semantics.  What I'm doing is I am actually following advice because I have spent the last seven days  in D.C. trying to get people to understand that all of these radio shows and all of these  Internet attacks and people calling me an idiot or a mental case are not true. 
[02:49:30]  I'm not saying they are.  I'm asking you whether he had foreskin.  That doesn't reflect on your mental health.  And I am telling you that I am following the advice and not to comment on that at this  time.  Now, if you ask me that question again tomorrow when you can pick up the phone and call me,  I may very well be able to give you that.  Right.  Or it may be that you're lying and you don't want people to have something that's provable  like that.  Oh, Jimmy.  It could be that you're lying and you don't want something that's a provable fact.  Like if you give the wrong answer... 
[02:50:00]  Hold on.  If you give the wrong answer, it's provable.  Whereas how much crack did he smoke is not provable.  Well, actually, it's not so much that I'm worrying about lying because I'm not.  And second of all, I've actually answered that question at one time and I've been told  not to respond to it at this time.  Who told you?  Because of what is going on today in D.C.  Okay.  Who told you?  Like I said, if you want to ask me that question...  So why would he even take this phone call?  Well, the thing is, okay, what answer did you give back then?  We won't ask you.  I'm not even going to tell you that. 
[02:50:30]  Did you sit on his dick?  Did you try to at least get it in a little bit?  No, I did not.  Just the tip?  Did you lick his bag?  What did I say about oral sex?  And yes, I did.  All right.  All right.  Let me tell you.  Now, you said you had oral sex with him in the limo and the hotel.  In Gurney.  In Gurney.  How far...  What's the time difference between the two times you gave oral sex?  The time difference is, like I said, all along.  I can't tell you it was the next day, the day after.  We were partying.  Hold on.  Do not...  Let me answer the question before you go there. 
[02:51:00]  Please, Anthony.  Sorry.  Okay?  Yes, sir.  Let him talk.  I have...  No, I am just getting tired of being misquoted.  Misquoted.  I know.  We don't want to misquote you because you won't give a straight answer.  Yeah.  Excuse me?  Exactly.  Sir, I said the time dates, the dates that were involved are November 6th and November  7th.  Exactly.  If you want to be specific in that, you tell me.  No, but that's the thing.  Were you a limo driver?  Why were you in the limo?  I was not a limo driver.  I rented five-star limo service. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, that's a good question.  Why were you in the limo with Obama?  How did you actually hook up with him?  What was the hook up?  The limo driver was a friend of Barack Obama's and introduced us to each other on the night  of the 6th of November of 1999.  Who were you that he would do that?  Because I asked the driver to introduce me to someone who wanted to drink and be social.  I was in town for the graduation of my godson from the Great Lakes Navy Training Center.  So you said introduce me to someone who wants to drink and be social and take it to a U.S. representative. 
[02:52:00]  I had scheduled to go out Saturday as well with my godson.  Wait, you're leaving something out.  You wanted to find someone that would drink and what did you say?  Be social.  And be social and maybe take it in the shitter.  No, no, I did not.  In fact, I was not asking to meet anyone on a sexual basis.  I was asking to meet someone who knew Chicago, who would be fun to spend the evening with  and socialize.  How did you know the limo driver?  I'm sorry?  How did you know the limo driver to ask him? 
[02:52:30]  I had the limo driver for two nights already.  And you said, can you introduce me to someone, some guy who will be fun to hang out with?  And why does that strike you as being somewhat odd?  I'll tell you.  It happens every day.  But why did he choose Barack Obama to introduce you to when Barack was, what was he, he was  a state representative at that point?  From my understanding, he was an Illinois senator.  And your point being?  Illinois senator.  So all of a sudden he says, I'll introduce you to a senator.  You're just some schlump.  No, he did not say he would introduce me to a senator. 
[02:53:00]  He said he would introduce me to a personal friend of his.  Okay, now let me explain this.  Do you honestly think that a senator would then get in the back of a limo with a perfect  stranger and do coke and get his dick sucked by this guy, you, and not worry that maybe  this might fuck up his career?  Dick, let me ask you, do you want me to answer the question?  Yes.  Hell yes.  I've seen it done plenty of times before.  Did you eat his ass?  Wow. 
[02:53:30]  Apparently.  You know what?  Go to Texas.  Go to Laredo.  Go to South Carolina.  I'll be right back.  Why?  I'm going to Nashville.  You're talking about this is something foreign for politicians.  Excuse me.  I didn't go out and seek Barack Obama out.  Sure you did.  You were looking.  I think you're lying, Larry.  I believed you at first, but I think you're lying because of your lack of details.  Sir, why do you think I have spent the last week here in D.C. with details, with documentation, 
[02:54:00]  sitting down and answering every question being asked of me face to face?  What documentation?  Yeah.  When is that info coming out?  I'm hoping by in the morning.  Yeah.  Have you banged anybody in D.C. while you were there?  No, I have not.  Yeah.  Your name ought to be Larry the Tattletale.  What made you decide to come out and admit that you blew him in the back of the limo on  his small white dick?  First of all, sir, I never even wanted to have to mention anything about the sex.  Look, I gave this campaign and Senator Obama the utmost respect and opportunity for six  and a half months to just correct his admission about his drug use. 
[02:54:30]  Did he sit back in the chair, or basically did you sit in the chair and he straddled your  face and fucked it?  Nothing personal, but you know what?  A good mouth-fucking for Larry.  I wouldn't either, sir.  You're absolutely right, Larry.  Larry the cable layer.  All right, hold on.  Maybe Larry's telling the truth.  I don't know.  I don't want to paint you as a liar.  What's a misquote that you think has been attributed to you that bothers you?  What's the what?  What's something that you've been misquoted on?  We'd like to know, because you're saying that you keep getting misquoted. 
[02:55:00]  Well, people say, well, I mean, Daily Kos is saying, oh, well, he was a mental patient  or, oh, it wasn't his limo.  He said Senator Obama's limo, and Senator Obama was a struggling senator, struggling to pay  his student loans, couldn't afford a limo.  People are just misquoting everything.  I never said it was Barack Obama's.  From day one, I've always said, I rented the limo from five-star limousine service.  Okay?  And where'd you pick him up?  Down outside of a bar off of Rush Street, and I'm still waiting.  That's another reason I'm here in D.C. is I'm fighting with Citigroup right now because 
[02:55:30]  they've been slow at getting the credit card receipts back to us.  But everything is documented.  You know, you can say you think I'm lying, and that's fine.  I know you are.  I'm sorry?  Here's the thing.  Because you're saying.  You doubt him so much, Jimmy.  I'll tell you, only because he said, I talked to a limo driver.  I wanted to meet somebody to hang out with.  And all of a sudden, the limo driver brings him to his friend, who's a U.S. senator, who  cops drugs for him.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  That's another misquote. 
[02:56:00]  Correct yourself.  He was a freshman Illinois senator.  I said that.  I said, oh, okay, whatever he was.  Well, freshman Chicago.  So he was his first year of high school.  That's a little young, isn't it?  Then let me.  What?  What?  The man is the same age as I am.  Yeah.  Yeah, but how old are you?  We were both 38 and 19.  That's exactly.  All right.  You go ahead and talk.  I'm sorry.  What do you do for a living now?  How do you make money?  I don't do anything.  I am sitting on disability and taking care of my medical problems. 
[02:56:30]  Who's disability?  That's just.  I'm sorry?  Nothing.  Yeah.  What kind of medical problems?  Do you have mental health issues?  No, I don't have any mental health issues, sir.  And I have my doctors to verify.  All right.  What's your health problem?  Would you like to have those?  Because I'm really getting sick of everyone.  I agree.  Larry, what's your health problem?  I have severe nerve damage.  I have a brain tumor.  I have asthma.  I have my right legs completely numb at all times.  Anything serious?  And many, many more that I'm not.  You know, they've already been.  One sec.  They're listed in order on the blog. 
[02:57:00]  Wow.  Huh, huh, huh, huh.  Okay, hold on.  See that, Nick?  You still blow politicians?  No.  My health doesn't allow myself.  You know what?  Can I say something?  You sure can.  You know, you can make fun and you can say what you can.  You know, you can give your opinion.  But let me tell you something.  Anything I've ever done in my life, I've always had the guts and the balls to stand up  and admit I've done it.  And at least that's more than I can say for most people who are in public office. 
[02:57:30]  And that's definitely more than I can say for Barack Obama.  How do you even know it was Barack Obama or just some dude?  What?  How do you know it was him?  That's a good question, actually.  Sir, the man was introduced to me as Barack Obama and Barack Obama himself introduced himself  to me.  I am not stupid.  No.  So, basically, the brain tumor, is it life-threatening?  Are you going to be okay?  I'm going to be fine.  What kind of tumor is it?  I have never said I was dying tomorrow, and I'm not dying tomorrow.  Yeah, so you're okay with the brain tumor. 
[02:58:00]  Is it malignant?  Is it like Ted Kennedy's?  Yeah.  My tumor has not known much at all in the last six months.  But you're cocked out.  Six months?  Yeah, I think that you're lying about the tumor.  Have you ever gone down on Hillary Clinton?  You can think whatever you want to think.  I've already produced my medical records otherwise.  And if the public thinks I'm required to put my medical records on the Internet, that's  a mistake.  You'll put your medical records on the Internet, but you won't say whether or not Obama is  circumcised.  Excuse me.  I have told you. 
[02:58:30]  I have been instructed not to answer that question until we finish today.  Who instructed you?  And I have given you the opportunity to ask that question after today.  If you can't respect that, then sorry.  Who instructed you?  Who instructed you?  I'm sorry?  Who instructed you?  My attorneys and some journalists that I'm working with at the moment.  Because they, what, did they want the scoop?  So basically the journalists are telling you, we want the scoop, so you're not going to  give out real information so the journalists can get a scoop?  No, actually, I'm listening to my attorneys, sir.  I don't listen to journalists at all at this point anymore. 
[02:59:00]  Then why'd you mention them?  Because you know what?  Journalists and radio hosts, you know, it's all about money.  It's all about ratings.  It's all about anything.  You're right, sir.  You know, I know some people.  What if we could get you a spot speaking at the Democratic National Convention this summer?  Would you answer that?  Would you answer Jim's questions?  Sir, by the time I'm done, I don't think Barack Obama's going to be speaking there.  Oh.  Wow.  Why do you hate him so much?  Sir, it's not a matter of hate. 
[02:59:30]  You know, what are you talking about hate?  Why are you doing this to him?  I haven't attacked this man.  I've told this man to stand up and tell the truth.  But when you started talking about it, I mean, everybody gets a blowjob, you know.  I mean, I'm going to take a limo.  Then why are you calling asking about sexual details if it's no big deal?  Because I've got a rod.  I want something to jerk off to him.  And Larry, you know there's no way you're going to be able to prove this in the end.  Yeah.  You're lying.  Yeah.  I don't agree with that.  I believe him.  I believe him 100%.  Now he's lying.  He wouldn't give him details.  I believe him.  I believe him.  He's been instructed not to. 
[03:00:00]  Jimmy, why can't you?  By lawyers and journalists.  Let me explain.  Jimmy, let me ask you a question for once.  Sure.  You say, why do I hate him?  I do not hate him.  Have you seen the attacks that have been leveled against my mother?  What?  No.  Who attacked your mother?  No, no, no.  Besides God with a retarded son.  Have you seen the vicious, harassing attacks that have been leveled against my mother?  Every living person and member of my family as well as my dad's father over the last month?  Oh, my God.  Hey, Larry.  Have you seen that?  That's terrible.  We're not attacking the cunt. 
[03:00:30]  Who has been attacking her?  Excuse me?  I know I did not just hear you say that.  What?  No, he's talking about the people that were attacking her.  Yes.  Yeah.  What I'm saying is, why were they?  He said witch hunt.  Oh, okay.  No.  My family has been totally attacked by paid bloggers.  This is ridiculous.  I am not going to let any presidential candidate attack my family.  I would either.  Are you telling me that Obama actually attacked that cunt?  Or are you saying that other people did?  Sir, I am telling you that I already have documented evidence that shows that the internet attacks 
[03:01:00]  came from and by paid internet bloggers paid by the Obama for America campaign  and going back to the Obama for America.  Yeah, but why are you lying about being on disability?  I think you're lying about disability.  You think I'm lying about what?  Being on disability.  Yeah.  Sir, I'm not lying.  All you have to do is check.  I've been on disability.  Oh, well, speaking of which, Mr. Sinclair.  I've been on disability since 2003.  Did you fail a polygraph?  I'm sorry?  Did you fail?  Yes, he did.  The polygraph test. 
[03:01:30]  Yes, he did.  No, actually, I think that's a matter of interpretation.  Yeah, you pass or fail.  They interpreted that you failed.  No, sir, a phony Ph.D. by the name of Edward Gelb issues a two-page report when normally  he issues a complete report claiming deception found, and then a second polygrapher who was  supposed to be reviewing them, who people claim that I approved or knew of, which I did  not, Mr. Gordon Barlin.  But why are you lying about the credit card receipts? 
[03:02:00]  Everybody knows they were sent out weeks ago, and you're saying they weren't.  Excuse me?  Exactly.  That's what I heard.  That's the point I'm trying to make.  Excuse me, sir.  Jimmy's right on it.  There have been no credit card receipts.  Right.  There have been no credit card receipts provided to us yet from Citiboo.  Yes, but that's not what they're saying.  They're saying that they went out months ago.  Yeah, we had them on the phone earlier.  The credit card people.  We've been on this story all day, Mr. Sinclair.  Excuse me?  What credit card people?  We talked to Steve from Yellowstone Credits.  We talked to Ted Burke.  And that's all we can tell you, because the rest of this info we're saving for our article. 
[03:02:30]  Well, that's fine, because I'm telling you right now, Citigroup has not released anything.  Yeah, but okay, but who's the one you're saying that Obama is levying a tax on your mother and that she's on disability?  And she's not on disability.  I didn't say my mother was on disability.  Don't backpedal now, buddy.  Yeah, don't backpedal now.  Oh, God.  You guys are good.  Hey, listen.  I said, I am on disability, sir.  Larry, so you're a cocksucker, right? 
[03:03:00]  Where are you at with, like, Hillary Clinton?  Would you suck her cock, too?  Actually, I have no preference for either one of the three candidates.  No.  So why would you have a first black candidate?  Why would you take him down with this?  Even if it's true, why would you do this to him?  Why would you turn around and ask me to be on your show the day after he self-proclaims himself to be the Democratic nominee and then turn around and make this into some idiotic joke?  We're not making a joke.  But it's not illegal to get a blowjob, you know? 
[03:03:30]  We're just trying to get to the bottom of it.  Right.  You don't really give any...  You have a good case.  We're going to be on your side.  You're lying, though.  I believe him.  You know what?  First of all, Jimmy, I think his name's Jimmy, the one that keeps screaming, you're lying, you're lying, you're lying.  That's Jimmy.  Mr. Norton, to you, sir.  Oh, no.  It doesn't bother me at all.  Trust me.  I hear people say that, and I also hear people say just the opposite.  Right.  It doesn't matter.  Just don't call your mother a cop.  You can call someone up on the phone and ask them to go on your radio show and ask them for something, and you can't see anything. 
[03:04:00]  Listen.  You can tell me I'm lying all you want to.  Mr. Sinclair, but just describe Obama's penis.  I will not do that before I am instructed to do this.  That's the big thing.  That's what happened with the Michael Jackson case.  You ever suck a guy's cock?  The Michael Jackson case, that's what blew it out of those...  That's why he called him, because he's lying.  Right.  He's not even on disability.  In the Michael Jackson case, he was acquitted, remember?  Yes, exactly.  But I talked to fucking Ted Burke over at the medical place, and he said that you're not on disability.  Right.  I heard that.  Sir, if you talk to Ted Burke over at the medical place, I receive disability every month. 
[03:04:30]  Yes, but they said it's for mental health reasons.  That's what Jack Dunphy told me.  Excuse me.  You are not...  Excuse me.  Now, you give me your name and tell me that you got someone that says that I am on disability for mental health reasons.  Jim Norton.  It's true.  So, Eric Nagel, Dr. Eric Nagel said that you are not on disability for that.  Dr. Who?  Eric Nagel.  It's one of the premier brain surgeons in the nation.  Yes, and he also does stomach stapling on everyone but himself. 
[03:05:00]  Well, I got news for you, sir.  There's a big way to get the Mayo Clinic.  I got news for you, sir, Jimmy.  The Mayo Clinic?  Hold on.  Mayo.  The Mayo Clinic.  No, I know, but I was trying to make it obscure, sorry.  No, that's okay.  The Mayo Clinic.  Actually, you guys are...  May it is.  Well, I got news for you, sir.  Yes, sir, yes, sir.  I was fucking foul-tipped in.  Anyone that gave you such a statement...  I got too excited.  ...that's very easily disproven because I have my disability card and my insurance card right here with me.  So they can go straight to, you know what, and back. 
[03:05:30]  H-E-double hockey sticks, I say.  I am disabled physically.  And mentally.  Physically, not mentally.  Yeah, but we also, believe me, you're not clear yet.  Because we talked to Dr. Marv Gresto, and he informed us that the brain tumor thing you're saying was simply for sympathy  and because you had a stock in a hat and wig company.  That's right.  Well, you know what's so funny is you talk to all of these people I've never even heard of and don't even know nothing about them.  You don't know who Dr. Eric Nagel is?  Yeah, see what the tumor's done to you, sir?  Exactly.  Your memory's going. 
[03:06:00]  And what about Steve Carlisi?  You're going to tell me you don't know who he is?  Well, actually, I think I just spoke to him on the phone.  Of course you did.  Exactly.  And he has talked to people in the limo company who said that you're lying.  At Five Star.  Of course you talked to Steve.  You guys have similar interests.  Yes.  Well, you know what?  Let me ask you this.  If Steve has talked to someone in Five Star, the owners of Five Star from 1999 through 2000 up to 2003 aren't even in the limo business anymore. 
[03:06:30]  And I'll tell you right now that there's a private investigator speaking with the driver as we speak.  Well, Steve knows all this.  How much more do you want to tell me that you know?  We would ask Steve if he was producing the show over here.  Now, how much more do you want to tell me that you have verified you know?  Exactly.  Where do we get Steve in here?  Yeah, get Steve in here.  Do you have any DNA of Barack Obama?  Not that I know of.  That would help.  Exactly.  We should have dribbled a little.  Can we pump your stomach?  Maybe something's still swimming around in there.  I'm sure that's long gone.  What other celebrities have you had sexual encounters with?  Oh, that's a good question.  None. 
[03:07:00]  Come on.  None.  I'm so depressed.  So Steve is here now, and Steve, tell him.  Exactly.  Hold on.  Steve, we got Steve Carlisi right here.  Yes.  We'll verify what we just said.  Steve, verify it.  Steve, I can absolutely verify it.  While I was tracking down Mr. Sinclair, everybody verified exactly what Jim was saying.  What happened to your hair?  I was wearing a hat for too long.  Cool.  Go ahead, Steve.  You verifying what?  Exactly.  Tell him, Steve.  Exactly.  Tell him.  Exactly.  Jim, exactly the point that you were making before, which...  Larry, we're watching somebody with good improv skills. 
[03:07:30]  Yes.  Apparently, I can't hear him talking, so his improv sucks.  I know.  Gotta talk.  Larry, it took me about a week to track you down, and everybody at the...  No, no, but the thing about the limo driver that I was just talking about while you were  paying attention...  Well, Steve, it shouldn't have taken you a week to track me down, because you emailed  my attorney, what, about two months ago?  Just follow the cum trail.  Yes, but you're...  But it took you a while to actually get back to me.  This morning was the first time I'd actually heard from you. 
[03:08:00]  No, it's not.  You're a tease.  No, I do not say that.  I have the sent emails from my email box.  I sent you an email back to...  I'm talking about on the phone, Larry.  Huh?  I'm talking about on the phone, Larry.  Well, this is the first time you've asked me to call you.  This is a great observation.  David L. from Philly.  This dude smokes crack and sucks black cock, but won't curse.  But who smokes crack?  Exactly.  Well, no, you snorted regular cocaine.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  No, I...  You know what?  I smoked crack back in 1984 and 85 and ended up at Mount Sinai Medical Center. 
[03:08:30]  For mental health issues, like we said.  With a bad case of pneumonia for about a week.  Right.  Uh-oh.  That must have gotten you scared.  And by the way...  It just kind of makes you think about what you're doing and how you're doing it.  And the guy wasn't a PhD.  By the way, I mean, we spoke to Dr. Richard Voss, and he said simply that you were telling...  You were lying about your body language.  Mm-hmm.  Dr. Richard...  What body language?  What...  Where have you seen my body language?  Dr. Richard Voss...  On YouTube.  ...observed you on YouTube and said you were lying.  Does Dr. Richard Voss, whoever this idiot is, know? 
[03:09:00]  He knows the good doctor.  Don't make fun of his speech agreement.  I don't know who he is.  You guys are throwing names.  Are you?  That's just like you're telling me that you spoke to a doctor that says I am not on disability  for physical reasons.  Dr. Eric Nagel.  And that is totally untrue.  That's right.  And even his nurse Travis backed him up.  So my question is, who are you speaking with to where you feel you have authorization to verify my disability?  All you had to do was ask.  I would have been more than happy to authorize that. 
[03:09:30]  We asked, and you're not giving direct answers.  Larry, we asked you questions.  Yeah, Larry.  No, no, no, no, no.  You don't want to comment on nothing.  No, no, no, no, no.  Don't even go there.  No.  I'm going there, girl.  Don't go there.  Listen.  Do you take a spin class in New York?  You guys are good?  But...  Larry, let's get to the bottom of this.  Are you suggesting that we raise a generation of super kids, and why?  What?  That's what I'm getting at.  Exactly.  Who are you voting for, Larry?  Hold on, Larry.  We got an expert in the field and studio. 
[03:10:00]  We got Uncle Paul.  Yeah.  Who's who?  Uncle Paul.  I got a kid show out here.  I wanted to know, did you take the semen that Barack gave you in the mouth and make a  cumsicle from it?  Oh, my God.  You guys, please do not go here with this.  I have spent too much time being serious and honest about this, and we're going to turn  this into a morning radio joke at this point.  Well, no, we're not trying to, but I just want to know that sometimes if you make a cumsicle... 
[03:10:30]  Don't worry.  I don't make things.  I just swallow and go.  Jeffrey asked a good question.  Who are you voting for?  Yeah.  Or is that private too, Larry?  Neither.  In fact, I'm starting to think I need to go to one of the foreign embassies here on Embassy  Row and seek political asylum.  Oh, why is that?  That sounds emotionally healthy.  How about insane asylum?  Why political asylum?  We're going to go to Iran. 
[03:11:00]  It was a joke.  Oh, okay.  Sorry, we didn't recognize you.  You had none of the makings of a joke.  Oh, no, I can't tell a joke, but you guys can.  Come on.  No, of course you can, Larry.  And I believe you.  For the record here, you know, I believe you.  Well, I will tell you what.  Those who say they do believe me, that's fine.  Those who say they don't believe me, that's fine.  But...  Where do you take a stand?  I'm going to get to the bottom.  Look, I'm going to get to the bottom of it to where it's either going to come out, and  they're going to ask the questions, and they're going to show what we have, and either he's 
[03:11:30]  going to respond...  I asked you the questions.  You won't answer certain ones.  You're being wishy-washy.  You're being evasive.  Well, first of all, I don't know who you are.  I've never heard your voice before in my life.  Oh, we've heard yours, Fez.  Well, I'm sure you have, but who sounds more high-pitched and feminish, mine or Jimmy?  Feminish.  Feminish.  Feminish is not a word.  Okay, well, I just made it up.  I would say the voice...  Exactly.  I just made it up, the whole story.  The voice that's coming out of a mouth with a dick in it sounds more feminish. 
[03:12:00]  Mr. Sinclair.  Yes.  Tell him about the discounts, Larry.  The what?  Nothing.  I just decided to go real inside.  So, I don't think you ever really answered the question as to why you're doing this.  Right.  The only purpose for me doing this is he needs to be honest about the extent of his drug use.  Who cares?  Why?  The sex is not an issue.  You know what?  Everybody in D.C., everybody in...  You know what? 
[03:12:30]  Just about...  I would be willing to say about 50% of every politician in every state...  Larry.  ...has engaged in some sort of extramarital sexual relationship.  Larry.  Larry.  Whether it be gay, straight, gay, fri, or whatever.  Larry, that's all good.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  You're giving us nothing.  That's why the frustration...  Exactly.  Give us a little piece of puzzle here.  Some guy called your mother a cunt, and he attacked you, and who cares?  No, sir.  I did not say...  You know what?  First of all, Jimmy, now, I've been respectful to you.  Yeah.  I understand it's morning radio. 
[03:13:00]  You're right.  What's going on with you, Jimmy?  I understand it's morning radio, but let's not get into the names...  No.  ...because I didn't say the name cunt.  No.  And you did turn around and say, well, I haven't attacked the cunt, and the one thing  I won't do is I won't engage in this with you.  I hate you.  Larry, I want to apologize on behalf of Jimmy Norton, because he is a little wise.  Well, no, I mean, he can call me anything he wants to.  You're the son of a cunt.  That's fine.  That's fine.  He can call me anything he wants to, but when you start calling my mother, who has been 
[03:13:30]  put through hell over this, that's a whole different subject.  Okay?  Larry, you gave us nothing, and we're frustrated.  Give us a little something about Barack Obama.  Let me put...  We're hurt by a lot of people, and a lot of this shit is picked up by the mainstream media.  So screw the fucking magazines in Washington and give us a little something, and we'll  blog them, and we'll call Breepard to get this going for you.  Yeah, but you listen to me.  We know Ted Drudge.  That's right.  You are not listening to me. 
[03:14:00]  I just told you there is a private investigator meeting with the driver today.  Who is it?  Detective Lark?  Who?  He's retired.  You don't...  I'm the one tired.  Who do you have?  Anthony Palacchino?  Is that the guy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, who's your lawyer?  No, I'm not going with the judge from Fox News.  Who's your private...  Who's your private dick?  You could be.  Who's your private dick, Larry?  Jokes aside.  Go. 
[03:14:30]  Exactly.  Cunt hugger.  Excuse me?  Did you and Barak's hang out after and cuddle, or was he romantic, or was it all like tough?  It was not all that romantic.  There was a few smooches on the neck and this and that afterwards.  It was...  Smooches?  We met...  We sat in the bar for about an hour, an hour and a half, talking.  Is it true?  What did he drink?  Okay.  He was drinking Chivas and Crown.  That'll call 45, I would have believed.  Excuse me? 
[03:15:00]  Who made the first move?  On the sex act or the drugs?  Either one, Larry.  Sex, sex, sex.  I had mentioned to him...  I had made the statement in the bar that I could use a couple of lines to wake up.  And he said I could use a blowjob and it hit a crack?  No, Jimmy.  Actually, he asked me if I was talking about coke, and I said I was, and he said he could  help me out.  So he copped the drugs.  Where did he cop the drugs from, Larry?  Go.  We left the bar, drove about 30, 35 minutes.  I gave him $250.  He gets out of the limo.  Five minutes later, he's back. 
[03:15:30]  Right.  Anything else?  Yes.  Who smoked the crack?  You both did, right?  No.  Exactly.  I didn't even know that he had bought crack or had crack until I had already done two  lines, was going down on him, and he pulls a glass cylinder and a baggie out of his pocket  while he's in my throat.  I'd love it if that was true.  He's fucking getting his fucking dick sucked, smoking crack.  Wow.  He really knows how to get the endorphins going.  You know, it's amazing.  I've actually met people who actually get more aroused on crack than they do on anything  else. 
[03:16:00]  Who are these people, Larry?  We want names.  Excuse me?  Who are these people?  Give us a name, Larry.  We think you're lying again.  We're private citizens.  It doesn't matter.  Well, we want their names.  Who are they?  Who are these drug-smoking fruits?  Well, first of all, I'm not a drug-smoking fruit.  Exactly.  Of course you are.  I'm a Marlboro-smoking fruit.  Oh, good.  Is that where the tumor came from?  Or did I call it your brain hat?  No, Jimmy, I think it's hereditary because it tends to run in my family. 
[03:16:30]  Who else has the brain tumor?  Who else has the brain tumor?  No, cancer tends to run in my family.  Who else has the cancer?  Why is it in your family, Larry?  Huh?  Not many people escape the cancer.  No, my father didn't escape it either.  My mother didn't, and I haven't yet.  All right, good.  But, I mean, that's not a sympathy thing, and I really, you know, when you start mentioning  that you have doctors making statements about the next time.  Dr. Eric Nagel made a statement.  No, no, no.  Let me finish, Jimmy.  Sorry.  The next time you want to say that you have information about me from doctors, why don't 
[03:17:00]  you ask me to give you the name of my doctor?  What's the name of your doctor?  I'll ask you right now.  What's the name of your doctor?  Dr. Vidi Boombox.  Judson Somerville.  Hey, hey, hey.  What is it?  Judson Somerville.  How'd your parents die?  Now, what else did you know?  Justin Somerton?  Oh, God.  Do you have something in your ears?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Yes.  It wouldn't be the tip of a dick, would it?  What's that?  Oh.  Oh.  Gee.  I think he's implying that.  I hear what he said.  He said you might have a dick in your ear.  I think you have a dick in your ear. 
[03:17:30]  But I do, but I won't tell you whether it's uncircumcised or not, because I'm talking  to reporters.  Hey, hey, hey.  And magazines.  It said talking to one of the biggest radio shows in America.  No, I, listen, guys, I understand that.  When you, when he called, when the radio guy called just now, he asked, I thought you guys  wanted me to go on in the morning.  Other shows are going to hear this and say, we're not having this guy on because he doesn't  reveal anything new.  He lies through his fucking teeth.  Or he's holding back.  First of all, you caught me on the way out the door.  You can say what you want to, but I assure you, Jimmy, I have listened to you. 
[03:18:00]  Now, you're going to give me a chance to respond, please.  Okay, but your doctor's name, please.  I just told you.  I couldn't hear it because you were too busy making snide remarks about...  Justin Somerville.  Justin Somerville?  And where does this quack reside?  Excuse me?  Exactly.  It's a proctologist there, Larry.  Oh, never mind.  Colon and rectal surgery.  Yeah.  Dr. Justin Somerville.  Justin Somerville is a proctologist.  First of all, my doctor is not a proctologist.  You got an asshole doctor feeding you Ambien. 
[03:18:30]  I bet you he goes in with a minor cell.  Oh, Christ.  Oh, God.  You clawed that in there.  See, because you got an ass cave, Larry.  Listen, I am sorry.  I like to explain mine.  Hey.  What are you talking about?  I am very sorry, but I do have to go.  I have an appointment.  What's your appointment, Larry?  Another lie?  No, sir.  My appointment's to meet with someone.  Who are you meeting with, Larry?  Would you like to know where and when?  Yes, I would.  Ted Kennedy?  I went to the APEC conference over at the Washington Convention Center.  No, that was canceled.  Everybody knows that. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, Larry, you're lying.  They canceled that.  Larry.  Are you going to talk about the time you fucked Joe Lieberman in the ass?  What?  Remember?  You remember?  Excuse me, sir.  I have never done what you just referred to to anyone, neither male, female, nor animal.  You've never fucked a guy in the ass?  You're a bottom.  You're a sloppy party bottom.  Yeah.  Right?  Oh, God.  With lying tendencies.  I hear you.  Larry, you're not telling the truth about Barack's penis.  We all know it.  Did you guys kiss goodnight? 
[03:19:30]  Not on the lips, no.  How many nuts does he have?  He better have two.  Oh, wait.  By the way, here's a way to figure this out.  Uh-huh.  How did you guys get in touch the second time?  Go.  Very good, Jimmy.  To you.  Very good.  How did we get in touch the second time?  Yes.  I've already said this a thousand times.  He shows up at my hotel room unannounced.  How did he know where you were staying the weeks later?  The drive because they dropped me back off before they took him for the Saturday night.  How many times do you even listen to anything?  Really, Jimmy? 
[03:20:00]  I listen to a lot of lies because the hotel had no record of you being there.  Excuse me?  I talked to the guy, fucking Ted the Night Guy over there.  He said that there was no record of you ever being in that fucking hotel.  There you go.  I just turned over the record straight from Choice Hotels outside of D.C. myself yesterday.  See?  And they've been in my hands for, what, months?  They've been on the Internet.  People keep saying they're fake.  They are fake.  You know what?  Ted told me.  Walk your behind into Choice Hotels International here in Silver Springs, Maryland.  I can't.  I'm on disability.  With me? 
[03:20:30]  How much do you want to be fucked that you're walking into things backwards?  What?  What?  Well, I tried.  Did your father pass away before or after you sucked a black man's penis?  Well, hmm.  Well said, Larry.  You have one in your mouth right now?  I bet.  Well, no, because, I mean, I had to listen to the question because if you had asked me if he passed away before Barack Obama, then yes. 
[03:21:00]  Okay.  But you didn't specify Barack Obama.  Did he?  You made a general statement.  Well, oh, well, you've had other black men's dick in your mouth?  Sir, I was raised and I was born and grew up in South Carolina.  What do you think?  What does that mean?  I'm thinking you did.  Yeah.  So you blew strong thermon?  Guys, listen.  I am really sorry, but I really do have to go.  Call me later.  Where do you have to go?  Call me later.  I love you.  All right.  Bye. 
[03:21:30]  There he goes.  I wanted to hit his mother again.  God damn it.  Larry Sinclair.  Oh, my God.  You're a son of a God.  Larry Sinclair.  He's a goose.  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony with Sam and E-Rock.  Sam, after the break, Tom Jones.  The man who taught Carlton Banks to dance.  Tom Jones.  Coming up live in the Opie and Anthony studio.  Stay tuned.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Coming soon to Broadway, Jim Norton of the Opie and Anthony show stars as that lovable redheaded orphan in the new production of Annie. 
[03:22:00]  The sun will come out.  Come on, Jimmy.  Tomorrow.  You got to lay in bed and die of cancer tomorrow.  Like Yule Brenner.  Oh, you used to be fun in the sun.  But now you're shitting in your bed.  And your head is full of mush like Lyle Alzado.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  The virus.  You're listening to the worst.  The worst. 
[03:22:30]  Of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony with primetime Sam Roberts and little old E-Rock.  I love it.  And in this segment here, Tom Jones is in studio.  And for those of you who don't know, Anthony loves Tom Jones.  Who doesn't love Tom Jones?  He's a legend.  He's still making ladies swoon at the age that he's at.  And he can still pull off a goatee.  Yeah, he came in.  He was promoting his new album.  And I think he had a show somewhere down in Atlantic City at the time.  But we got to talk to him about concert stories. 
[03:23:00]  About do ladies still throw panties at him?  Have they shown up at his hotel room?  And what's going on?  He just had a bunch of stories that kept everyone entertained.  Everything you've ever wanted to know about Tom Jones and so much more.  Right now.  On the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  How much does he make?  He makes at least 17 bucks a show.  You're listening to the worst.  Oh, wow.  That's pretty cool.  No, not at all.  Of Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, because it's a piece of shit.  Oh, yeah.  Tom Jones.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:23:30]  And sitting here, none other.  Tom Jones.  Right.  How you doing, man?  Yeah, good.  Thanks.  Got a new album out?  Yes.  God damn.  You're still cranking.  Yeah.  I mean, not even like one of these guys, because there are people out there that are, you know,  hanging on by the skin of their teeth to a career and stuff.  But I saw you recently in Atlantic City and just kicking ass.  And the fans, what got me was, there are kids going to see you, and then, you know, some 
[03:24:00]  of the old broads, they're still digging on you there, Tom.  Yep.  But it's amazing, the audience that goes to see you.  And the show you put on, phenomenal.  Thank you.  I mean, you would think, not that I, you know, I'm not saying, hey, you know, why don't you  settle down or something like that.  But, you know, you would think that you might lighten up after the years.  Yeah.  You're still all over that stage.  You got the set of pipes on you. 
[03:24:30]  It's still amazing.  Thank you.  And if I could keep just kissing that ass.  Why not?  I'll keep doing it.  I had a copy, an advanced copy of this CD.  Some people would probably call it an illegal bootleg copy.  And I was raving about it.  I mean, it really was fucking great.  I mean, it was all, it was energy.  It was, it was, that, that, that's the song.  I'm alive.  And I was running around just yelling, I'm a man.  Not quite as well as you did it, but it was just fucking great.  I, myself, never heard of you.  No. 
[03:25:00]  Of course.  My father, when we, my father, when I was like 11 years old,  and this had to be 40 years ago,  came home with an album signed by Tom Jones  and said he played cards with you.  But you would, his last name was Voss, but I think he was lying.  Hold on.  What's his last name?  Joe Voss.  Yeah, Joe Voss.  I know Joe Voss.  Good ass.  My father.  You don't know.  Yes.  Yeah, I remember Joe Voss.  He played cards with you and he came home with an album.  Yeah, yeah.  We used to hang out.  Get out of here.  He was telling the truth?  Yeah.  In the corporate and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:25:30]  Wow.  That, that is actually, I'm shocked.  Joe Voss.  Yes, my dad.  Yeah.  Are you kidding?  Are you really about Joe Voss?  No, no.  I know Joe Voss.  Oh, my God.  He's the guy that would come in and complain how stupid his kid was.  I mean, it must have made fun an impression.  I haven't seen him for a long time, but yeah, we used to hang out.  Yeah.  Does he owe you money?  No.  No.  Well, he, he never used to carry any money.  I remember that.  I'll chip off the old block. 
[03:26:00]  I tell you, it was a, it was a funny thing.  He came, um, cause I knew him from New York, you know, and then he came over to, to England.  I was playing the Palladium in, in London and he showed up and, um, he said, I'd like  to invite you to a party tonight.  I said, Oh really?  You know what I mean?  Cause he was, he was, I was inviting him.  So, uh, yeah, it was in, in the Ritz.  He had a suite in the Ritz.  We went over and had a big slap up meal, champagne.  I couldn't believe it.  And he paid for it.  This is, I'm stunned.  Hold on.  Either there's another Joe Voss who's big in the record industry. 
[03:26:30]  Well, you have one of those photographic, you have like a photographic memory?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  How would you remember?  That was 40 years ago.  Joe Voss from 40 years ago.  Damn.  Well, that's something, Rich.  You got a claim to fame.  Finally.  I really heard of TV.  Okay.  Father, uh, hung out with Tom Jones.  And I like the fact that Tom still has no interest in talking to Rich.  No, no.  That makes me really happy.  Like, who cares?  All right.  What's he doing now, Joe?  Uh, yeah.  He works at a travel agency. 
[03:27:00]  You know, he's married again.  Right.  The third time.  And, uh.  Oh, boy.  He lives in New York here.  Oh, good.  You know.  Real success story there.  Just like Tom.  Is it hard to pretend?  I asked Tom.  Is it hard to pretend, like, when the older chicks come up to you, that, you know, that  they still have, that you're interested?  Is it?  I mean, because you're legendary.  Tom Jones is legendary for just, for women.  That's like your thing, is that chicks throw their underwear at you.  Yeah.  Which is a great thing to be known for.  Um, and I guess you've got to be nice to the older ones, but it's got to be kind of irritating. 
[03:27:30]  No, they, they, you know, they're good.  They're good people.  It's, uh.  The cougars.  People, you know.  Yeah, but I mean, when it comes to, like, you know, banging them.  Oh, well.  No, no.  No.  What's the cutoff age?  Do you have a cutoff age where it's like, they've got to show you a date, if it's over  this, you've got to give them a boot?  Uh, yeah.  Boat 30, I would think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's probably it, right?  30 still?  Yeah.  Younger than 30?  That's right.  Wow.  30.  He's Tom Jones, for God's sake.  What are you thinking?  I saw, like I said, when I, when I went and saw you in Atlantic City, uh, there were, uh, 
[03:28:00]  these older women that came up and they're throwing those big old bloomers at you and  stuff.  And, uh, then these, uh, these real young girls came up with thongs.  That's right.  And they start throwing those and they're singing and dancing to, to your songs, uh, the newer  songs and, you know, your classic hits that everybody knows.  And I'm just watching this going, this guy has just got it down.  Well, there you go.  You figured out the formula.  A lot of, a lot of practice. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You hypnotize these girls.  Is, uh, uh, I mean, what, what has changed since, you know, touring in the older days and,  and, and touring now, uh, for you?  It's the same.  You know, I'm just an older version of what I was then.  It's my attitude is the same and I still like the same music.  You know, I think, I think I've learned more about music.  You know, at one time I like, cause I was a teenager in the fifties.  So rock and roll was a big thing with me.  Fifties rock and roll, you know?  And, uh, so I, I, I didn't really particularly like swing singers, you know, I didn't like 
[03:29:00]  band singers.  That was like before.  But then as time went on, I, I learned to appreciate Frank Sinatra, for instance, you  know, Tony Bennett and people like that, which in the fifties I, I thought were like passe,  but, uh, well, you're like, you were an Elvis fan, right?  Like you were a big Elvis guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fifties rock, you know, Jerry Lee Lewis, French Domino, Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, of  course.  We had, uh, cause we had a prep sheet.  They always give us a prep sheet, which I knew that, you know, I mean, most of your stuff  is so well known, but our crack team, this is what they said, he became friends with 
[03:29:30]  his idol, Elvis Presley in 1965.  Right.  And stayed that way until his death in 1967.  1967.  1967.  Yeah.  That's a short friendship.  And, uh, boy, we sure missed out on a lot of Elvis there.  Yeah.  So you, you, you, he was your idol or your guy you really looked up to and you, and  you met him and hung out with him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And my, my first year in, uh, in the business, 1965, when I came over to do, uh, some  Ed Sullivan shows and I met Elvis Presley in, uh, in Hollywood, you know, I was out 
[03:30:00]  there doing an Ed Sullivan show because it's funny at that time.  Uh, it went color.  You know, it was black and white before that.  Right.  And then when they went to color, they had to do it in, um, Los Angeles because they  didn't have the facilities in New York to go to color.  So then I went out to LA and did some shows out there and Elvis Presley was, uh, I went  to Paramount studios for, to do a song for a movie and they said, Elvis is here and he'd  like to say hello, you know?  And I said, wow, Christy, you know, everything was like happening in that first year. 
[03:30:30]  It was mind boggling.  What was the song that year that was the big song for you?  Uh, well, my first hit was, it's not unusual.  Hmm.  And then I had watched a new pussycat and then I had a ballad called with these hands.  So that was in, uh, you know, in 65.  So when I met Elvis, he was walking towards me singing with these hands.  Hmm.  I thought, Jesus Christ.  I mean, here comes Elvis.  It was like a dream, you know, it was, wasn't, it wasn't real, but, uh, but it was.  And he said, how the hell do you sing like that?  I said, well, you're partly to blame, you know, listening to you.  So did you ever like, I mean, with a guy like that, you're hanging out with your idol 
[03:31:00]  and you're a guy who's known to like, let's be honest, a lot of chicks.  Did you, did you ever get to, like, we call it pulling a train.  I've done it with him, me and him on a girl.  Like normally what would happen is because he's better looking, he would get the chicks  and like, he would kind of guilt them into banging me as well.  And it'd be like, me and him waving at each other over a girl.  And there had to be some of that with, with you on the road all over all the years.  Hmm.  Yeah.  It was very non-committal.  Hmm. 
[03:31:30]  Like now you could do grandmother, daughter and granddaughter.  You could do like.  Nobody wants the grandmother.  You bang the mother and the daughter.  You ever bang the mother and the daughter together at one point in your career?  I can't tell you that.  That's a yes.  See, for me, ask me that question.  Absolutely not.  I've never done that.  And I can't tell you that is a yes?  That's an absolutely yes.  And that's probably like in many different countries.  He's probably banged them in England and here.  What's the most chicks of the time?  We're not only going to ask you about girls, but like Tom, I was so psyched that you're  coming in because again, you're a guy, you are everything, like you're the pinnacle of 
[03:32:00]  a rock star when it comes to that because they're throwing underwear at you.  Yeah.  You don't care about that.  That is big.  The gigs, like the coolest gig was like back then was like the Copa and stuff, right?  Yeah, that was.  Yeah.  That was the place.  In New York.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When I first came over, I did a Dick Clark caravan of stars in the summer of 65 and that  sort of turned me off a bit because we've toured everywhere in a bus, you know, all over America 
[03:32:30]  and I didn't realize America was so big until I, until I did that.  So I went, I went back to England with my tail between my legs a bit, you know, because I  thought this is not the way, you know, didn't seem like show business to me, but then I was  playing a place in London called the talk of the town, which is a nightclub.  And then my agent saw me and said, you know, you need to be in the Copa and nightclubs like  that.  So, and then my TV show came out.  So, yeah.  What was the big, um, like, like, I don't understand how back then did somebody just see you and 
[03:33:00]  decide, Hey, wow, this guy's got a great set of pipes and, uh, he's got the sex appeal.  Let's, uh, yeah, at the beginning.  Yeah.  My, my manager, well, the guy that became my manager, Gordon Mills, his name was, and  he came to Wales where I come from and he was well, she came to visit his mother and  he saw me, uh, in a club and, uh, he said, my God, you know, your voice is incredible.  And I said, well, thank you.  And he said, if you ever come to London and you want some help, you know, I'm, I'm your  man. 
[03:33:30]  So then he called me up and he said, look, I've never managed anybody before, but I'd seen  him on television.  He was a singer himself.  So I knew that he was in the business, you know, so I grabbed all of him with both hands  and I thought, you know, you know, you're not getting away from me.  So, so I could tell that he was the one that, uh, that was going to do it.  And then he wrote, it's not, not unusual.  And, uh, that was it.  That was the beginning of it.  And, and, uh, you brought up, uh, the TV show.  I remember, you know, watching the, uh, the, uh, Tom Jones, uh, show the variety show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  On ABC.  Yeah.  How, how did that work for you? 
[03:34:00]  Now you're, you're a club singer.  Uh, you, you hit.  And then they're throwing a TV show at you.  Was that a rough, uh, thing for you to go?  Like, I've never done television.  Well, I, you know, the only television I had done is guesting on.  Right.  Right.  But now you're, you're never hosting.  Yeah.  You're the guy.  Yeah.  So I didn't know whether I could do it.  So we did a special, first of all, and.  Cause you were in like sketches, right?  They'd put you in the comedy sketches.  Yeah.  I remember watching that.  Yeah.  So my parents, yeah.  While they weren't yelling at each other. 
[03:34:30]  Right.  So, uh, I wasn't crying.  It, uh, it, it worked.  And I liked it because I could do all kinds of songs.  You know, as when you go on TV and you, you guessed, you do one song, maybe two.  Right.  You know, so you gotta, but then when you've got your own show, you can do all kinds of stuff.  Yeah.  You'd be in the middle of something to just break into song, you know, whatever, whatever  song you wanted.  The duets, you know, I was always pushing for, for, for rock singers.  So ABC television wanted more, uh, middle of the road people.  Right.  But I was pushing for Jerry Lee Lewis and a little Richard, you know, which, and Wilson 
[03:35:00]  Pickett, which I got on there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was like a trade-off.  You know, I had to have Barbara Eden on as well.  You know, I dream of Janie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kind of do, do the little sketches and stuff.  And, and what a trademark that, uh, opening was, it was the microphone.  Yeah.  And the pinky ring.  And the ring, yeah.  This is Tom Jones.  There you go.  And, uh, it's not unusual it would start and, uh, then, then you'd come out, but you didn't  find that difficult to, um, to host.  Like how, how involved were you in the actual production of, of that show? 
[03:35:30]  Oh, very much so.  Yeah.  It was, yeah.  I mean, I was nervous, as I say, when I did this pilot, you know, but, um, well, so the  more I did, the, the, the easier it became and it became second nature to me.  It was like a strange time back then because, uh, if, if you did hit in music, apparently  they just gave you television shows like Glen Campbell had, uh, had one and, uh, Andy  Williams.  Andy Williams was the one.  Yeah.  Dean Martin.  Dean Martin.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dean Martin would have that.  Do you find nowadays, uh, it, it is just more difficult to, to break in and, and, 
[03:36:00]  and get that popularity?  Um, I, I think it's basically the same, you know, the, as it was then it's always youth  orientated, you know, record companies are always looking for young bands and young singers.  It always seemed though that back then they would give, if somebody clicked, they really  were just handed so much, uh, media, uh, back then they were all over the TV.  They were doing guest spots on laughing and, and, uh, having their own shows. 
[03:36:30]  Right. Well, the reason I got my show, they told me was that I could, I could do all kinds  of songs, which was, um, and I was like 28 years old then. So, uh, I sort of, I filled  a gap in there because it was either, you've got Andy Williams, you know, singing sort of  middle of the road stuff and then Glen Campbell country, you know, so they wanted somebody that  could cover all of it and, um, which, which ended up to be me.  We ever, uh, we ever censored on television for words or movements or yeah, Ed Sullivan 
[03:37:00]  show, especially really, what did, what did they do?  Well, when I first came over, um, in 65 and they said, you know, you can't move like that  on television. We'll cut the closeups. They were telling me actually having sex with a  girl on stage. They were telling me something that they told Elvis Presley nine years before.  Wow. Like nothing had, had, had really changed. And, um, I remember I did a, and you had to  do it. It was like an, almost like an audition, even though, uh, you know, I was signed to do 
[03:37:30]  the show. You still had to do a rehearsal in a rehearsal hall. Cause they wanted to say  and do it live. Yeah. They wanted to hear exactly what you were going to do. Wow. And  so the, I did a, an album track called, uh, what you're going to do. And the opening line  is, uh, you've been running around balling, right? Which means having a ball, you know,  right, right around balling, playing the clubs every night. And when I said balling, they  said, what you can't see balling on, I said, well, it's so I had to say wailing. Oh, wow. 
[03:38:00]  You should change it to fucking.  And then when I had Delilah out, you know, they said, uh, well, we got to change something  in Delilah. I said, well, if you, if you're going to take out, I felt a knife in my hand and  she laughed no more. That's the reason he's killing. That's the big, yeah. The big payoff  there. But she said, no, it's not that it's, uh, at break of day when the man drove away,  I was waiting. So they said, if you, it was at, it was at break of day, you know, and when 
[03:38:30]  the man drove away, that means he was with her all night. I said, well, yeah, that's why  he kills her. So it wasn't the fact that he's not having breakfast. Yeah. It was, it was  a sex thing. I mean, it was unbelievable. Wow. He was like the most powerful man though.  Ed Sullivan. I mean, was he a nice guy or was he, he was, he was a nice guy and, uh,  he liked me, which, which, which was very useful because I did like five Ed Sullivan  shows, you know? So, uh, I heard Ed hated, uh, Joe Voss. Is that true?  Well, he didn't, because he never paid, never paid a bill, the skin Flint. Exactly. 
[03:39:00]  He threw a party and he told everybody he was paid for. Was still people looking for Tom  for some money for that party back in 1968? Was there any, anybody that like opened for  you that became a big star? Um, yeah. Well, the who, you know, they used to open my show  in, uh, in 65. Yeah. Jesus Christ. How do you follow the who? Yeah. Were they hard to  go on it? Cause Sabbath, Black Sabbath had Van Halen opening for them in like 78 and they, 
[03:39:30]  and like that, they said that was, it was really hard to go on after Van Halen had done what  they did. Right. Did you have trouble after the who or didn't, you didn't care? No, no,  not really. Especially there to see Tom, you know. Well, they used to do these package tours,  you know, you got all kinds of people, a mixture of rock and pop and, uh, you know, so, uh, and  everybody dug it. So it was, it was fine. Did you do any of the Motown scene? Any of that  stuff? Like the tours with the Supremes or any of those people? Yeah. When, when I did  this Dick Clark Caravan of Stars tour, there was the Shirelles were on there and a doo-wop 
[03:40:00]  group called the Jive Five. You know, there was a lot of, uh, people that were around in  those, uh, in those days, you know, so they wanted to sign me on Motown once. They  were really, yeah. You know, you don't find many artists that can talk about their experience  with the Shirelles and Motown that are still putting out albums, still relevant, still  drawing crowds and still have the pipes and you're willing to take chances, uh, that other 
[03:40:30]  people aren't. When, when, you know, when you covered, uh, Kiss, uh, the, uh, uh, Prince  song, people were like, what the hell is he doing? But, but it was a big hit. Yeah. Well,  when I did it with the Art of Noise, I think they thought, oh, Vegas meets, uh, techno pop,  you know? And, uh, but then when they heard it, heard it, they realized that it was, um,  you know, it was a serious record. Yeah. Cause it wasn't, it wasn't kitschy. A lot of people 
[03:41:00]  thought it was going to be this kitschy kind of a goof, uh, uh, album, but, um, man, you  sang your balls off on it. It sounds fantastic. And, uh, it, it put you into another category.  It put it, it, you, you then transcended, uh, where you had been and were able to keep  your, your career going, which you've done for years. Uh, was, was that a calculated thing  to keep your career going this long? Did you think when you started that you'd, you'd still 
[03:41:30]  be in the business and still be as is? I didn't, I didn't know whether I would still  be alive. Really? Yeah. But, uh, with, with, with doing kiss, I liked the song and I was  doing it, uh, in my show live, not thinking about recording it. I just thought it would  be a good song for the, for the stage. And then the Art of Noise saw me do it on TV and  asked what I recorded with him. So I said, okay, let's give it a shot. At the time also  was the, really the peak of, uh, MTV videos and everything. So the video really took off and 
[03:42:00]  just watching. I remember my, you know, my mother would watch and go, Oh my God, it's  Tom Jones. It's like, yes. So we had to break through video. Right, right. You know, so  I'd never had an award from MTV before, but, uh, that was huge. What do you, what do you,  do you do anything for your voice or you're just one of those guys that are just lucky  because some people, their voice goes after a while and you still, man, you, you, you  nailed those notes. I'm lucky. It's, it's, it's a God given, uh, talent. Yeah. It's,  it's a natural voice. So, um, but I went for lessons when I was a teenager and the, the 
[03:42:30]  woman that was, uh, giving me, uh, voice lessons, she said that you're singing, you're  singing pretty, you're singing pretty correctly. If you're going to do pop music, you know,  you can't do it any, uh, better than you are, you know, as far as breathing is concerned  and using your diaphragm, you know, in, in, uh, in the right place. So I think that's what's  kept me going. I've never really abused it. Singing correctly, right? Yeah, I think  so. And it's so odd to listen to somebody that has such a powerful voice and not think 
[03:43:00]  how are you not ripping your voice apart on a nightly basis, but that's just the natural  way that you, uh, you sing. It's, uh, quite fantastic. I don't have to, I don't have to  warm up or anything. I don't do any exercise. I'm sure there are singers that want to just  belt you in the head. It's like, I don't do anything. Yeah. No honey and tea or any of  that. He just walks in, he belts out the show, bangs 80 chicks and then leaves.  I did not love that. I could, I could not believe how great this CD was because I didn't 
[03:43:30]  have any of the names of the songs. It was just all tracked. Yep. But it's like, you  know, you've been around for a long time and it's just, it's, it's a really, like you said,  relevant, powerful CD. It's just fucking great, man. Thank you. I mean, uh, you know, I don't  know what else to say about it. It is still like, it's one of those, uh, you know, you could,  you could screw to this music. It's, uh, you know, powerful, uh, chicks love it. Not  the opening song. You can't know. Cause every time he goes, I'm alive, you're like looking  around like, you can't, but there's slower songs and then there's fans. It's like, it's, 
[03:44:00]  I wish I could, I could do it more justice, uh, and describe it better. Cause I listened  to the whole thing a few times through working out. It was great. Do you still, uh, you still  enjoy doing the classic, your, your hits, uh, for the people because they, man, do they  eat that up? Yeah. Well, that's the, the people keep them alive, you know, when you,  when I do Delilah, for instance, you know, it's so recognizable as soon as it starts that  you get applause up front, you know, before, uh, before you even start it. So it's a, it's  a great feeling. I like that because if I went to see somebody and he or she didn't do 
[03:44:30]  any of those songs, I think, well, what's there are people that do that with that. You  know, the fans are left going, you know, Hey, I'll, I'll get the new album. I'll learn  to love these songs and see them next time around, but you know something, play some  hits. That's what I do in a live show. All new stuff that I put in and, and I sort of  fit the hits through up, throughout the show, not like new stuff and then old stuff. And  it works. They all, they all, they all work. Yeah. I'm being played by the band, you know, 
[03:45:00]  the same, same band is playing it all. So you don't get that, uh, shock from listening  to one record and then jumping to, to another, you know, playing it all. Do you got a favorite  song? I mean, I know it's a, it's a kind of a hokey question, but do you have one that  that like that you, that you do that you're like, that this is the best thing I've ever  written? Uh, it's one of the, um, there's a song called, it looks like I'm never going  to fall in love again. It's a ballad that, uh, a guy called Lonnie Donegan wrote for  me in, uh, in England. And that, that's still stands up. It's a, you know, it's a powerful 
[03:45:30]  ballad. And you do that every live show? Yeah. But it's not unusual is, is the most  important because that was the one that changed my life. You know, your first hit record is,  is, is so important and it still stands. Oh man. Yeah. It's a great arrangement. A lot  of your songs, you hear the classic Tom Jones songs on the radio and you just, you, you  kind of stick with it. You know, you, you don't listen to that. How do you not listen  to like, she's a lady or sex bomb and just go, that's a bad motherfucker. How do you not? 
[03:46:00]  You can't not listen to those songs. They're great. When, uh, yeah, when I saw you live,  I could not, I was in the casino, just sex bomb, sex bomb, the whole, for hours, just  singing that. If that isn't one that gets stuck in your head. Yeah. It's funny cause  kids like that song as well. Yeah. I don't think you know what the, what it, you know  what the words are cause there's some, there's some risque lines in there. But, um, that  is odd because, uh, I did see, uh, during when I, I saw your show, uh, there was a girl 
[03:46:30]  had to be eight years old, standing up kind of, uh, on a table with, uh, parents just  watching. And I'm going, there's an eight year old watching Tom Jones and there's risque  lyrics going on there. But they don't hear those. No, no. They just like the music. Yeah.  Like the music and like, uh, no, she didn't throw her underwear. Although she was looking  at Tom's pants at one point there, you ever, you ever, uh, done TV and had people go, uh, 
[03:47:00]  you know, could you wear some padded underwear or something? Well, no, when I, when I had  my TV show, I had to wear a belt, like a dancer's belt, really dancers wear. Yeah. Yeah.  Keep it all, keep it all in place. You know why? Cause there is, there is an instance where  you'll see him on a live show and go, wow, that is Tom Jones. What a great problem to  have. Sir, your penis is going to offend millions of people. I just assumed he had  a spare microphone. If, uh, the one went out, he was able to just reach in and get 
[03:47:30]  another. Let's say Burt, Burt, uh, Robin from Batman had the same problem. Uh, Jim  Norton does not have that problem. My friend, my friend, Jim Florentine's a comedian and he  had such the opposite problem that his first TV appearance, he actually put a sock in the  front of his pants and his penis looked bigger. There was a rumor for years that, uh, that  you had done that. Yeah. There was the sock rumor. That's right. Yeah. But I've, I've  said is those pants were so tight. There was no room for it. No room for a sock. It was 
[03:48:00]  all Tom Jones. There you go. And you probably didn't realize of course that the tight pants  would accentuate or you never would have worn them. Exactly right. It was just a fashion  statement. Of course it was. How great is it to go through life? Like you wear pants that  show off your hog and chicks go, Oh my God. And they throw hotel keys at you. Like, what is  that? Is there any better feeling than that? No. Of course not. Did you ever take a hotel  key off the stage and not know who you were going to see and just do it? No, I've never  done that. You had, what would you have? Like the roadies and stuff? Like, you know, kind 
[03:48:30]  of tell you who was who and what was what? Exactly. Yeah. So comics, like most good comics  have small units because they're covering up their small unit with comedy or whatever.  It's just being like all the comics that have big units aren't that good. Richard Pryor  had a big dick. Did he really? Yes. Okay. So one guy. Leave it to Voss. Because it was  legendary. We're just joking with Tom about his penis. You're going into like a real  psychological profile. Yeah. A lot of people have small penises and our fathers 
[03:49:00]  gambled with Tom Jones. Thank God. So the new album, what was the, what the hell am I  trying to say here? Oh, uh, uh, you have people write, uh, your music or you, uh, yeah.  Well, when I, I signed with the S curve is the label that I'm with here. And, um, so they  were getting me songs, you know, that had already been recorded or, and I said, I want  some new stuff. And then they started getting me new songs, which I was not excited about. 
[03:49:30]  So I thought, well, I better get in, uh, with the songwriters and, and, and work with  them, you know, and tell them what I, what I want. Oh, okay. Rather than wait until songs  show up, you know? So that, that's, that's what I did. Each writer that came in, uh, I  worked with them, you know, and told them. That's, I guess after a time you figure out  which songs are best suited for you. Yeah. Cause, uh, it must be hard to have somebody  else write a song for you and then look at it and go. Well, nine times, nine times out 
[03:50:00]  of 10, there'll, there'll be something to do with sex. You know what I mean? And of course,  you know, which, which is fine. If it, if it's a cool song, like sex bomb is a very  clever song, right? You know? So that's fine. But you don't come up with many of  those, you know, the other ones are sort of just blatant, you know, and, um, not  clever. So that stuff, uh, like one songwriter wrote, uh, you look good with my  t-shirt on, you look even better with it off. And I said, I think that's, you know,  we need to move. Yeah. The sexuality in the Tom Jones songs has been very subtle. 
[03:50:30]  Yeah. Uh, like that. I guess you leave the, the literal to, uh, the hotel room, you know,  whatever. That's what I did. I got with them and sort of started to write with them and  change things around and say, you know, so that's, uh, and thank God it, it turned out  well. I mean, we had a load of, I recorded a lot of songs and then we picked the, what  we feel is the, the best out of the bunch, you know, to put on the CD. How many, uh, how 
[03:51:00]  many dates do you tour a year? I mean, you are, you're always out. Yeah. About  200, 200 shows. Give or take. Do you get a regular gig in Vegas? Yeah. MGM. Oh,  okay. I saw you at the Riviera years ago. Didn't you? I worked, I saw you upstairs  at the Riviera. Uh, not the Riviera, Caesars Palace. I was at the Flamingo, uh, Caesars  Palace, uh, Bally's. I was in for a while. I mean, it was Bally. It was Bally's. Bally's.  Yeah. Bally's. Yeah. I was working. Have you noticed how Vegas has changed a lot over the 
[03:51:30]  years? Like years ago, it was all like the, the wise guys that ran it and took care of  everybody. And now it's just a bunch of corporate people. Yeah. Who just don't seem to take care  of the town as well. It's, um, it's easy, you know, cause they only want you to do one  show a night. When I was there in the sixties, you know, in seventies, I used to do two shows  a night, every night for a month. Oh yeah. And, uh, after a while, you know, you start to  get, wow, that, that was, uh, my voice was suffering a bit from, from that. A little taxing  on your voice. Yeah. Especially in Vegas, it's dry there, you know, so. And Tom, maybe a few 
[03:52:00]  of your friends, you could get a few of your friends to sing at a club. So, uh, yeah, but  they were there though. I think we would work well together if I opened for you. I think we'd be.  Oh Jesus. I'm saying. He'd rather have Joe work with him again. Yeah. Listen, man, I'm a top  notch comic. There's no audience. I can't work. Clean Vegas. I'm telling you, I think we'd be,  you know, maybe your opening act gets sick or whatever and you need a rich boss. I mean,  I'm just looking out for the team. Make the audience sick. Yeah. Or maybe, maybe the bulge 
[03:52:30]  in his pants isn't available. So he needs a replacement, which I'm sure you'd be perfect  as. He doesn't need a comic open. You don't use comics as openers, do you? Not anymore.  I do. I do the 90 minutes myself though. Did you use comics as openers? I used to. Yeah.  Did any of them bomb? Uh, no, they were, they were all pretty good. George Wallace was  with me for quite a while. Oh, okay. Jay Leno. Jay Leno used to open for me. Hmm. Jesus  Christ. The who and Jay Leno. Yeah. It's not bad on the credentials list. Got a few. I saw  George Wallace a couple of weeks ago. He's still in Vegas. He's at the Pink Flamingo. At 
[03:53:00]  the Flamingo. Yeah. So you're going out. When are you going out to promote this? Um, well,  I mean, you're up, I mean like a tour dates, like you're out right now doing the press. I  mean, when are you going to have concert dates and stuff? Uh, yeah, I will do next year  now because I'll be promoting all the way up to Christmas all over. You know, I got to  go to Europe next week. Yeah. He like has to do press all of the world. Yeah. That's  really, you're recognizable everywhere. Yeah. I mean, that's, that's something you  go to Japan and they're like, Oh, Tom Jones. Yeah. When I do a gig, I fly in the day of 
[03:53:30]  there's always tickets available. So I go on the local radio and I tap dance and beg  and then hopefully people show up. It's gotta be nice to go to Europe and then go to  Africa, wherever it is you go. Yeah. I probably could have picked a better second  country than Africa after Europe for Tom Jones's audience, but I'm a non-improving  idiot. Uh, is there anybody? The Kenya dust bowl. Yeah, I know. I really am. So how is  this Sierra Leone and is, are the pirate hijacking is going to affect you in Somalia? I'm a true  asshole, Tom. My apologies. Um, anybody you'd like to collaborate with that you haven't 
[03:54:00]  yet that you'd love to do something with? Uh, yeah, there's, um, singers. I mean, Whitney  Houston, I think is, you know, I don't know what she's singing like right now, but, um,  she's got a great, you know, great voice. So I think a duet with her would be nice. Alicia  Keys, I like. Oh, she's great. You know, uh, Duffy, you know, is, is a Welsh singer. I've  seen Duffy on, uh, in the Starbucks. Like they have her, it's her, right? Or is it he?  Starbucks? Yes, go. Okay. I've, I've seen her CDs in Starbucks. The CDs. Not working in  Starbucks. That would be atrocious. A worse future than, uh, Joe Voss. Get over your fault 
[03:54:30]  what I mean. He remember, you remember Joe Voss. Like Joe Voss had been outside five  minutes ago, waving, yelling, Tom, it's me, Joe Voss. So either Joe, Tom's memory is obviously  really good. Do you remember my name? Yeah. God damn it. He has no idea who I am. Ah, it's  just me. Yes, I do. I've seen you on television, doing stand-up. Holy shh. Wow. Tom and I  are chatting. Ah, I hate this. Well, that makes me, what, can, can, can two men of similar 
[03:55:00]  ilk discuss something? Yeah, where are you going to find one? Have you really? Yes,  really. That makes me very happy. Yeah, yeah, very funny. A guy like Tom Jones had to get  up and turn the channel because of me. It's funny, he was banging one time and something  just wrecked the vibe. Oh, it's that little man with the awful head shape. Wow, I'm so happy.  Oh, damn. Well, I'm a true fan, man. I'm really happy you, you, you came in and you're  going to be promoting, and again, I've been harping about this album. I really have been 
[03:55:30]  raving about this album for the last week, when we were, two weeks ago, because we were  off last week. You've been amazing over the years, and it's, it's amazing, because I do  remember as a kid watching and seeing my parents just freaking out about it, and then, you know,  going to see you live myself and just loving it. It's transcending generations, my man.  Thanks. Hi, everyone, this is Tom Jones, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony. It's the worst of Opie and Anthony with E-Rock and  primetime Sam Roberts, both from the Opie and Anthony show. You know, Sam, when Patrice 
[03:56:00]  O'Neill is in studio, it's a good shot that most of the conversation is going to lean  towards some kind of black discussion. That's true, race. Race. It starts, it gets down  to race. Louis C.K. was also in studio this day, so they started talking about racial porn.  Louis saying that he didn't like looking at black women, and them trying to figure out,  is that racist? Yeah, because Patrice then says, who likes looking at white women in  porn because their boobs aren't as good, and they have no ass? E-Rock. Did we ever resolve 
[03:56:30]  this? Well, we wouldn't, if we, even if we did? Yeah. I'm not saying whether we did or  didn't. Okay. But if we did, I'm not going to tell you what the resolution is, because  then why would you listen to this? That is a good point. What the fuck is this? You're listening  to the worst. What the fuck is this? The worst of Opie and Anthony. I don't know why, but  I've never seen a black woman that gave me a bummer. The only black woman I find attractive  is like, yeah, white looking black women. Yeah. Let me ask you this. Like a white woman  with a tan. Ooh, ghetto black. Yeah, okay. Ghetto black is where it's at. Is it insecurity? 
[03:57:00]  Is it insecurity thinking that all black women like big giant dicks? No, because I do have  a kind of a big dick. You're packing? Yeah. I don't believe that at all. I have a nice  dick and a pretty big dick. Really? I've been told by enough women that I believe it now.  I've been told by that, but it's not true. Wait, Louie, who was playing you that day?  Unlucky Louie then. What? Oh, shit. Oh, well, you know, it was flaccid and it was afraid  of the camera. But when it started, it's nice. But it grows into something. I can't help it. 
[03:57:30]  It's not something I have a control over. A nice shave. I have something I have any control  over. A nice shave. I'm going to be quite honest to you. I only like mix something. I don't  like a full-blooded nothing anymore. Right. I know what you mean. Full-blooded  anybody. Your girl doesn't look full black. My girl's half something. Yeah. I'm attracted  to half something. Exactly. Half something. Half something. Full Asian does nothing. Full  white women. It's just I enjoy a mixture. You need some conglomerated mongrel. Yes, indeed. 
[03:58:00]  I think it's what you grow up with because I still, all my fantasies are still, were built  when I was 10. I'm still going on those. Yeah. You know, so fucking. Age-wise.  Blonde cheerleaders and older Jewish women. Still the two things I like the most. Who else  is racist again? You said you're racist again. No, I am. No, not at all.  But you can figure that. Yeah, there's certain, like, I, uh, I don't like, uh, probably like  Asian. I don't like really, unless they're mixed with something. They gotta be kind of,  uh, Amerasian. You know, something like that. I've met black women. I've met black women 
[03:58:30]  that I have, that I've flirted with and that I've really gotten like a crush on, but then  I think about fucking them and then my dick won't get hurt. And I can't control that.  What kind of fucking Nazi? That's awful. I know. I'm sorry. Like, as far as black  chick goes, maybe, maybe Francine. I'm talking pussy. Yeah, maybe Francine. Not dating, not  loving. I'm talking about pussy too. I'm talking about pussy too. But she's crazy. I wish I  could. She'd have to cave her head in with a hammer when you're done. I'm ashamed. I'm ashamed 
[03:59:00]  of my dick. You don't jerk off the black porn? No. What? I've never looked at black  porn. You're a piece of shit. Inadvertently, I've looked, inadvertently, I've looked at  black porn and gone like, her father must be so fucking upset. Jesus. You're talking  about white, we're talking about a white girl with a black guy. Two hands full of mouth  and ass. What are you, what are you, we're not talking about black dick. We're talking  about black pussy. Yeah. You're missing a lot. Like, you know, when I'm stumbling, when  I'm like looking through porn. Like a chick like that, a black chick. I'm not into like 
[03:59:30]  dark black chicks. Where's this fucking fan at right now? Fan.  I don't know. They're, they figured we're doing all the heavy lifting today. Fan, we  need you. Come on. When I look, when I'm looking at porn and I see, uh, brown and round.  Brown and round. You're going to, you're going to show me shit that might as well be two girls,  one cup. Dude, we did brown and round last time, didn't we? No. No, we did fat. We did  mysweetfatty.com. A whole nother story. My sweet fatty. Today it's brown and round. When 
[04:00:00]  I'm surfing porn. It's brown and brown. I agree. Right there. You wouldn't stick your fucking  dick in that. What the fuck? No. Are you fucking kidding me, man? No. So here's the  thing. I mean, I will, I have been jerked off by black hookers. Oh God damn. What the  fuck is that? I closed my eyes and thought about white people. See, she's pretty light.  Yeah, she's not black. Is that a weave? Are all of you fucking the same way? These women  are. No, I'm with you, Patrice. That's kind of light. Oh, see, what's that? Look at that  right. Oh, look at that giant, pretty giant asshole. I don't want a giant, pretty giant asshole. 
[04:00:30]  Just that beautiful little asshole on that giant ass with, with the pink twat. Are you,  are you not well? I know. Wow. See, we're different as a people. I don't think there's any points  like, like if you went to harrymongolianbitches.com. Look, oh my God. All right. Yeah, but that,  oh, look at that. Are you fucking joking? That's a little scary now there. That ain't, 
[04:01:00]  uh, Patrice, you just lost a big, oily asshole. That's scary? Just how it moves. You're losing  me now. What is that? You're losing me. It's a giant, oily asshole. That's intimidating  right there, man. It looks like a fucking cat scan of a heart. They are moving that ass.  It looks like it's going to eat your water. It looks like it's going to eat your dinner  or something, man. It's like, feed me. Do you know how fucking fast my face would be 
[04:01:30]  in just, Patrice, I was with you, but this is scaring me. There's way too much. That's  scaring you? There's too much extra meat on the ass. That's scary? All you motherfuckers  are gay. No, that, those big, fat, scary. A fat black ass ain't doing it for me. That's  scary. It looks like a centipede's mouth thing. Hello, hello, hello, hello.  Like a Muppet. Skinny white bitches don't do anything for me, meaning I don't look at  them and go, oh, but I'll fuck one. And I'll do the same thing to a skinny white bitch that 
[04:02:00]  I would do to this bitch right here. No, I need to be fucking visually excited. I would  say the same thing. I could certainly work up a boner and fuck one of these girls, but  I wouldn't. Really? As a favorite of them? Sure. Sure. Hey, I'll throw it. I'll throw  it. Yes. Totally. Here you go, nigglet. I'm going to try. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. She'll  have a good time. I have a nice steak. I'm white. That's hilarious. But when I see them, 
[04:02:30]  I don't get hurt. Wait, what about that one? That one's all right. What, all the way up  and to the right, she's white. White chicks. No, the second one down, there's something  else in there. That's white. These are white chicks. I was looking for... Now we're just  looking at porno. I was reprimanded for not looking at porno fast enough, so I'm just trying  to be ahead of it. Before, I didn't consider that porno. I don't know what that was.  Exploitedblackteens.com. Exploitedblackteens.com. Exploitedblackteens.com. This is like precedent 
[04:03:00]  cases in a courtroom. Yes. Oh, your honor. I cite the case of exploitedblackteens.com. Let's  bring it up, please. Let's submit it. What the fuck, Chase? The defense calls. Exploitedblackteens.com.  Are you sure we got it right? This looks like one of those general... All right, we're  looking for it. Okay. Warning. Warning. Warning. All right, let's see. Okay. You're about to see  pussy. Now this... Exploitedblackteens.com. Okay, now you add the young and fragile and 
[04:03:30]  they get interesting. It's true. She's ugly, though. Yeah, she's a little fucking... No,  she's not. She's all right. I like her. With the jizz across the face. This racism bothers  me. No, this isn't racism. This is pure... Wow. Jesus Christ, that guy is laying some silly  strength. Holy shit. What was that, a home invasion? What the hell is that? She looks like  Brandy. That chick looking like Brandy a little bit. Come on, dude. Look at this girl.  She's not bad. She looks like the daughter in the first Lethal Weapon. I found her kind 
[04:04:00]  of cute. Yeah, she was cute. I changed it from giant, greasy black booties moving...  Which shows you that it ain't the color of the skin. It's the content of the ass. It  is the color of the skin. If I could quote Martin Luther King. Look at this girl right  here. Are you fucking joking? No, this girl's... All right, that ain't bad either, right?  No, these girls are all sexy. She looks like that Raven Simone fucking chick. So does she.  So does she. So does she. So does she. So does she. Wait a minute. Go back. Go back  one. The one with the sweat sock. The sweat sock. Yeah. That's really sexy. A very dark 
[04:04:30]  black girl with like tube socks from the 70s. Yeah, with the ABA socks. All right. She's  pretty dark. Look. Look, she's very dark. That's it. I'll give it to you, Patrice.  She's really pretty. And Jemima wig on. That's right. Jesus Christ. That's right. She's got  the Boston Celtics socks on. That's the thing. She has to be in context. She looks like a  white chick that's really tan. That's what it is. And that's fine by me. You don't fucking  make me sick. I don't like the big fat asses. These motherfuckers make me really sick, 
[04:05:00]  man. It has nothing to do with race. We're proving it has nothing to do with race. You're  not. Do you guess? Do you realize saying, oh, long as the little nigglet has long socks  on and a police hat? I can't. No, that looks good. I'll cop to it that it's racist. I  can't help it. How is it? I'm not going to cop to being racist on this. But why? I'm  sexually, I am. I can't help it. I can't help that I don't get a bonus to certain people.  And you know what? You have access. Oh, my God. That looks like Urkel. That looks like 
[04:05:30]  fucking Urkel with tits. I'm also prejudiced against fat people. Look at fucking Urkel taking  a load on the face. Did you just fucking call her Urkel? Look at her taking a load on the  face. That's Urkel. That is the sexiest thing I've seen all year. That pretty girl.  That's Urkel. She looks a little manly, Patrice. She's got a mustache. She looks manly with  those little deer eyes looking up at cum. Deer eyes. Deer eyes. There's a lot of eyebrows  there. And those tits ain't doing me justice. Oh, you. Fuck you. What? I'm just done with 
[04:06:00]  you. The nipples look like the flying saucers from Mars Attacks. See, they're not witchy anymore  because they know this is too racist. One joke bombed. Fuck you. They're with me.  No, no, no. Not the bombing. Your racism is just too much. How come I liked the black  chick? I fucking liked that. I didn't like the fat ass. You didn't. I liked the black  chick. You put him in context. And I want you to explain your racism to why. I don't know  why. I mean, I just don't get hard. Blacks on blondes. Yeah, this is really going to fucking 
[04:06:30]  make me happy. This is a Steve C. suggestion. Oh, is it? Yeah. Oh, here we go. Yeah, this  is great. But she's not blonde. What went wrong? This should be called, I wanted my father  to shoot himself. Well, no joke. The other link he sent me was daddysworstnightmare.com.  Get out of here. Really? Yeah, let me go to it. Fucking Steve. Yes, daddy's worst nightmare.  Get Steve in here. Steve is the expert. It's either another site like this or him bringing  girls home. It's the same, though, as like a black. I don't get turned on by fat women. 
[04:07:00]  Right. So why would it be white or fat? You can put white fat asses up there. I ain't  going to fucking like it either. It's a sexual aesthetic thing. Oh, God. Ladies and gentlemen,  the expert on porn. Yes. Steve. Steve C. Hold on a second. Try my daddy. My daughter's  bangingblackzilla.com. Blackzilla. Wow, whole sentence website. Yeah, this guy, Blackzilla,  just his helmet is eight inches, I think. Holy shit. Oh, my God. Ah, shit. Maybe that's 
[04:07:30]  not it. Hold on. Oh, damn. Google, Google that sentence. Wait, you know Blackzilla? Patrice?  I know what he, I know his work. He's packing. He knows his, it's not hard to figure out. I  don't think he breathes fire. He knows his specs. He knows his specs. I know I'm familiar  with his, with his, you know. There you go. Oh, boy. All right, we're getting Blackzilla  on the screen. Here we go. It was one of them. I want to see, uh, oh, that's one of those 
[04:08:00]  fucking sounds. Ah, shit. If I'm what, if I'm sure. Oh, come on, I sent you two good  ones. Thanks for nothing. Oh. Oh. See, I told you. Holy mother of God. Oh, God damn. What the fuck?  That looks like a mugging. What the fuck? Is that why you carry a gun? That's it. Just  in case fucking Blackzilla comes in. He could. And bangs on your door with his cock. He doesn't  have to. He could just take his cock and use it like No Country for Old Men. That fucking  thing and just bang the lock out of your door. As he fucking, he's fucking into a pussy 
[04:08:30]  goes fave, friendo. Holy shit. Fucking bang. Oh, get out of here. Oh, that's like that  horse cock that killed that gay guy. Yeah. That's the only thing we got out of slavery  is this. It's porn. Porn in our reparations. Yeah, see? That's not right. Wow. Look at  her face. She's sucking on that cock. It's like sideways in her mouth. Her face is just 
[04:09:00]  hard. It's a horrified look. Okay. Terrific. Imagine that. I would say that's another way  that I'm, I mean, if I, if I'm surfing porn. Another racist thing. Yeah, another racist  thing about me. Is to see a black cock and a white woman. If I see, if I'm surfing porn  and there's a big black cock, to me, it's like stumbling on gay porn. I'm like, oh, well,  just keep moving. Just keep moving. But if you see a white cock, you think there might  be some chicks involved, so it's okay to look at it. I have no problem watching a white  guy fucking black girl on porn. You motherfuckers are awful. Just awful. What? Then you at least 
[04:09:30]  know her rent's going to get paid. Pussy should be the thing that, that, that crosses all boundaries  that bring us all together. I know. Like I have a dream. There's no, there's no conversation  that a guy, guys should go, here's the, here's the conversation. It's like my friend will go,  Hey, look at this chick. And I go, ah, her head's kind of big. He goes, would you fuck? I go,  that has nothing to do with it. That's what the conversation should be when it comes to 
[04:10:00]  pussy. Like, oh yeah, black girls don't turn me on, but I'll fuck the shit out of them.  That's more to do with your sexual fucking obsession. I will fuck them. It's just that  they're not the thing that gets me, my dick hard right away. Fair enough, I'll go with  that. That's all. If there were no other women left on the face of the earth and I needed  to fucking cum. There was no other women. They just needed something, a dumpster.  Right. Just to like dump a load in. I'd be happy. They're just above a cup. Yeah. Well,  what kind of cup? There are cups. Fake China. There are cups that are nicer. There's some 
[04:10:30]  pretty cups out there. There's some cups out there that are, there's like black women.  There's like some kind of cups, black women, other kind of cups. Like that's the way the  certain kind of cups. You know, I don't think we've done much today to bring the races together.  No. I don't think my birthday is really bringing the races together. Usually me and Patrice  will have discussions. And I think at the end of the day, it kind of helps bring us, give  us a more mutual understanding of each other. I think we've gone a couple of steps back 
[04:11:00]  today. Well, the pussy thing bothers me. That really bothers me. Because that is just  something. Don't you understand it has more to do with your sexual obsession than it does  us not liking certain types of women sexually? You'll fuck anything. You transcend race because  you'll fuck anything. Well, I'll fuck anything. Most guys will fuck anything. I'll fuck anything  too. That's absolutely true. Under certain circumstances, he will at the drop of a hat.  When you say anything. That's why he bought a hat. So he could drop it and fuck something.  Fuck people. Not anything is the problem. Like some guys might not fuck a certain level. 
[04:11:30]  Like they won't go into a nine. We're talking, we're not talking like ugly and this and  that. We're talking racially. Yeah. You, you have problems getting horny with a black  10. I found those black skinny chicks attractive. Okay. Definitely. But listen to how you're  saying it. Brown and round were not black 10s. Those are not black 10s. No, I won't  be tentative then. Those are black 10s. I'll say they were hot. See, everybody's got a  different scale. Those are black 10s. Black 10s, those fucking fat ass ones. And the black 
[04:12:00]  community. Oh my God. They are coveted. Just like white guys covet tall, skinny white  women. I don't. I don't. They do nothing for me. I will fuck one because they exist.  Okay. So that's exactly the same then. That's exactly the same. The only thing you won't  fuck them is like a Yeti. So you're admitting to the same prejudice as us then. That you will  know that the women that you, that you, that you think white people hold it in the highest  esteem, the tall, but you just said they don't do anything for you, but you'll fuck some. 
[04:12:30]  But listen, if I go look skinny white bitches, especially ones like that have the bone in  the pelvis. Like you can see the pelvic bone. Yeah. That's, that bothers me. But you go,  she has a pussy and she, you know, she looks good to something else or someone else. It's  like, Hey, you know what? White guys love this. Not my thing. Bend over. Like, it's  like, look at those black, greasy asses. Nah, that's nothing for me. But you know what? 
[04:13:00]  Black, greasy ass. Here we go. Pussy is the, is the ultimate denominator out of all of it.  And I can't believe you. Yeah, but you have your preferences. Don't you have to find something  aesthetically pleasing when you're fucking it? Do you want to look down at some fucking  ass and go like, uh, aesthetically to you? I'm only saying the same thing you're saying  about skinny white girls that these girls with the big black asses, they're not my preference,  but I would fuck all of them. Let me say that's great. That's the, she has a big ass. That's  the same ass that you went ill to except for on a negative picture. I didn't say it's the 
[04:13:30]  negative. It's the negative version of that black ass. Keep going. Let me see something  else. Same ass. Look at that shit. It's the same exact ass. I do prefer a big white ass to  a big black ass. You a motherfucker, man. Yeah. That's the same shit Hitler probably  said. Yeah, I gotta say. I gotta say, you're right. I think I do prefer a big, bigger white  ass to a big black ass. Oh, see the girl with the bunny ears and the big ass? Yeah. That's  awesome. I love that. Are you fucking joking? I would never disrespect it. I would never disrespect 
[04:14:00]  madness by going yucky to that. Love that. Love that. That's the same ass. I know, but  they're white. Are you fucking joking me? Yeah, but they're white. They're white. He's telling  you, yes, but they're white. They're white. Look, white. White ass. Blonde hair. Look at  these fucking assholes. They're good. They're good. I thought that black girls was on the  fucking screen. That was like, oh, oh. I know. Deliciousness. Don't worry, ladies and 
[04:14:30]  gentlemen. Those chains are made of tinsel steel. No, no. And that's the worst. What the fuck  is it with you? Of Opie and Anthony. Are you professional or not?
