<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts announcing potential show expansions to New Orleans and Austin, Texas, while addressing an email suggesting their imminent cancellation.  Jim Norton was present in the studio.  The conversation quickly shifted to the hosts' harrowing commutes through NYC traffic, exacerbated by an NYPD event at Carnegie Hall. Opie vividly described his resulting road rage, detailing the damage he inflicted on his car's interior by punching it, throwing out his CDs and cassettes, and repeatedly slamming the car door. Anthony shared his own frustrating commute experience.  Listener calls from New Orleans followed, with one call being abruptly cut off.

A substantial portion of the show focused on a news story about O.J. Simpson's alleged involvement in an ecstasy ring, satellite TV theft, and money laundering. The hosts engaged in a highly offensive and exaggerated comedic portrayal of Simpson's supposed activities, employing fictionalized scenarios and phone calls filled with numerous offensive jokes and stereotypes.  They also promoted their "What the Hell is That?" contest, soliciting pictures of unusual growths or medical conditions for on-air diagnosis, previewing some already submitted entries.  A review of a Limp Bizkit remix album, met with strong dislike from the hosts, was also included.  Numerous listener calls followed, reacting to the driving stories and O.J. Simpson jokes, interspersed with discussions of the hosts' musical preferences and a debate over bands like U2, and  a Paisano's restaurant advertisement.

The show then delved into a discussion about Phish and the Grateful Dead, sparking a debate amongst callers about the merits of each band.  This expanded to include other artists like Van Halen, Black Crowes, Nirvana, Alice in Chains, and Ozzy Osbourne, with highly critical and vulgar commentary. A caller recounted a negative experience at a Grateful Dead concert.  A significant segment featured Earl, a listener hospitalized with bleeding ulcers, providing updates on his condition and hospital experiences in humorous and often crude terms, through multiple calls.  The "What the Hell Is That?" segment continued, with several callers detailing unusual genital and other bodily issues.  Nate, a caller with a testicular issue, scheduled an in-studio examination.  Other callers described a third nipple, half-face sweating, and a hairy genital growth, along with a listener who cut their mouth on a toenail.  The segment concluded with a lengthy discussion of Opie's bet to hit Central Park from their building's roof with a golf ball, debating its feasibility and dangers. A heated call with Pharrell Williams followed, stemming from a negative review of a Limp Bizkit remix they produced, exchanging mutual insults. A Rockaway Bedding live read was also included.

A later segment opened with a discussion about golf, including stories about caddying for Clark Gillies.  The rooftop golf ball stunt was further discussed with a somewhat concerned NYPD caller. An interview with Erin, a 19-year-old mother who developed a fungal infection after sucking on a co-host's (Stalker Patty's) grotesquely described hammer-toe to win Britney Spears tickets, followed, detailed in graphic terms.  Cheryl, a caller with a cauliflower-like genital growth ("balloon knot"), planned an on-air diagnosis on Friday.  This transitioned into a sexually explicit and vulgar fictional conversation portraying Tom Brokaw as resentful of Dan Rather, with exaggerated claims of Brokawâ€™s tyrannical behavior and sexual exploits.  Further calls discussed the fungal infection, the upcoming "balloon knot" diagnosis, and the "Homeless Shopping Spree."  "Balloon Knot Joe" expressed disgust at the planned genital examinations and the show's content.  Jay Moore called in, discussing his experiences and future appearances.  A discussion about Chris Kattan allegedly stealing a bit from Jim Brewer from a previous Opie and Anthony broadcast concluded the segment, with numerous other callers adding to the chaotic and crude nature of the show.  The show closed with a promotion for Jay Moore tickets.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  If people know not to let a joke brew that long, it's like hiding your stuff.  Hi, Opie and Anthony.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including New Orleans?  New Orleans.  Man, I think we're on in New Orleans starting today. 
[00:00:30]  Nice.  But I'm not positive, Anthony.  I think we are.  So if we're on in New Orleans, what's up?  866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW.  That doesn't make sense, though.  And if it's true that we're on in New Orleans, hello, Mardi Gras.  Yeah, we finally have a reason to go down to New Orleans.  Oh, we will be taking advantage of that, that's for sure.  We've been trying to broadcast live from Mardi Gras for many, many years.  And if we're on in New Orleans, and I think we are, we're coming down there very soon. 
[00:01:00]  Hell yeah.  A couple months.  What about that guy that sent around that email that said we were done?  Oh, yeah.  I think we're on in Austin, Texas, too.  Austin, I believe.  There you go.  I'm not sure about that either.  So if you're hearing us in Austin, Texas, or New Orleans, we definitely want to hear from you today.  866-277-4WOW.  If you're calling from New Orleans to tell us that we suck, go F yourselves. 
[00:01:30]  We haven't even done anything yet, so shut up.  Where was my folder?  Matt Stout picked it up by Matt from...  Who?  Matt Stout.  Oh.  All right, so I got my folder.  All is good in the world.  Thank you.  Picked it up by mistake.  Opie freaks out when his stuff is missing.  This is Don and Mike scripts.  This isn't our stuff.  See?  What is that?  He picked up a bunch of folders, I guess.  Don and Mike perceptuals.  What is it?  I don't know.  That's theirs, not ours, so...  All right.  So here we are. 
[00:02:00]  What's up?  Jim Norton in the studio.  Of course.  Anthony in the studio.  Yes.  And we're all on the same page today because we all were stuck in traffic on the way to  the station today.  Yeah, there's something going on today.  Something at Carnegie Hall.  A real big deal with the NYPD and stuff.  Oh, was it?  I think so, right?  So why do they block the streets off?  I don't know, but I beat myself up today.  Yeah, you get crazy.  I do the same thing.  No, I'm not joking.  I beat myself up today, Anthony.  Yeah. 
[00:02:30]  You were yelling scream and you beep your horn a lot and then...  I punched the interior.  Oh, you do punch?  Oh, hell yeah.  I didn't think you were a puncher.  Oh, no.  I punched the interior.  I once punched the windshield of my Volkswagen Buggy many years ago and cracked it.  Really?  Because I was so angry.  Well, I came in just beyond past.  And then Anthony came in beyond past.  And then Norton came in beyond past.  By the time Norton came in, I was fine again because I got to relive it through you guys.  Yeah.  But I beat myself up today in the car because I just couldn't take it. 
[00:03:00]  You were punching your console.  And did you break something?  I broke a few things, yes.  And I just got a new car.  And your new vehicle?  Yeah.  So we're going to have to send it to the shop.  But with me, New York, we all know, I mean, just driving around is just, it's just a nightmare.  We're not saying anything new, but we accept it as New Yorkers, right?  And especially lately, it's really been a pain in the ass.  Yeah.  With the 9-11 thing, we've added more time onto our comfort level, you know, our acceptance level. 
[00:03:30]  Uh-huh.  And I had this clock that ticks in my head when I'm stuck in traffic.  If I'm stuck in traffic, I'm cool.  I'm like, all right, I'm expecting this is all right.  For a limited time.  For a limited time.  Yeah.  But then it keeps clicking and clicking, and I feel that my body overheating.  Literally, overheating.  You feel it.  Give me 10 minutes on the clock, and then I lose my mind.  Then all of a sudden, like today, it was 11.30.  Uh-huh.  And I said to myself, I was already driving an hour and 20 minutes. 
[00:04:00]  It's a ride that should take an hour, seriously.  Yeah.  But I'm 20 minutes, I'm like, all right, I'm accepting this.  But I said to myself, I only have 10 minutes to go.  If that clock in my car turns to 11.40, and I'm not in the garage.  It's over.  I am losing it on myself.  Not others.  On myself.  That's healthy.  So now, it's kind of like that movie, kind of like that scene from the Michael Douglas movie.  The, uh, the, uh.  Yeah, yeah.  Falling down.  Which is, I could totally relate to that character on many levels. 
[00:04:30]  So, um, I'm in the car, and it's ticking and getting closer to 11.40.  I'm only, I was only five minutes from, uh, our building in the garage, Anthony.  Yeah.  It took me 40 minutes, to make a long story short, to get into the garage, okay?  So now the clock is clicking and ticking, and it gets to 11.40.  I just lose it.  Yeah.  My first move is, uh, between the two seats is where you get your CD holder and your cassettes  and stuff on that little paddle.  Sure.  I just start pounding on it as hard as I can. 
[00:05:00]  My, my hand went numb, and I swear I said to myself, great, I can't do a show today because  I need an x-ray.  Now you've, uh.  That's never good when you think you need an x-ray.  You thought you broke your hand.  Oh, without a doubt.  I thought I broke it.  That wasn't good enough, because now it's not moving.  Because when you react like that, you expect something to happen in return.  Yeah.  But you're still stuck in traffic, right?  Tony from Mineola's confused.  He goes, did I hear right?  Opie was beating himself off in the car.  No, no.  He was beating himself up in the car.  Beating myself up.  Right.  Yes. 
[00:05:30]  So that wasn't good enough that I thought I fractured my hand.  No joke.  It went numb and all that, because I just pounded.  There's, there's like a hole in my cassette thing now.  I got it, and it's cracked.  Have that fixed.  Sure.  I have to have that fixed.  So that wasn't good enough, because I'm still stuck in traffic.  So now I lift open that panel, and I took all, I'm a mental case aunt at times.  I took all the CDs and cassettes that I had in there, and I threw them out the window  onto the sidewalk.  So I lost my WBCN 2001 naked disc.  Uh-huh.  I lost the, uh, the Limp Bizkit, uh, remix CD, which blows anyway, so who cares? 
[00:06:00]  The sidewalk could have that one.  Uh, Sandy's Mary J. Blige is gone.  Uh, I think.  Terrible.  Uh, Ben, I got some bad news.  I think I threw out the, uh, the U2 Urban Plaza CD.  Oh.  Idiot.  I'm such a big talk.  But I'm not sure.  I'm not sure, but it was in there.  Uh, he got the best U2 bootleg ever.  And you threw that out.  A year ago when U2 played at Irving Plaza in front of what?  A thousand people, Ben? 
[00:06:30]  Tops?  At Irving Plaza.  It's a, it's, it's right off the board.  It's a, it's a great, great, uh, bootleg U2 show.  So I'm suggesting, Opie, that you should look into the Segway People Mover.  Uh, that thing that, that guy invented the other day.  So you can just wing in and out on your stupid two wheels.  Yeah, we should talk about that later.  So I threw all my CDs and cassettes onto the sidewalk and it made me feel a little better.  But now, once again, I'm still not moving.  And now I've already like, in my opinion, fractured my hand and I threw all my stuff out of the car. 
[00:07:00]  Now, this is the move that I'm, if you saw me doing this, please call the show.  I decided to open up my, um, my driver's side door and just open it and slam it about 20 straight times.  Oh, you just went crazy like that.  I just went nuts.  I couldn't take it anymore.  So I opened the door.  I'm like, go, go, go, go, go, go.  You ever see when chimpanzees lose their mind in, in Africa and, uh, they want to like show their, their other chimps that they're the boss or that they're angry with something.  And they run and they pull trees out of the ground and throw them and like smack themselves and, and throw rocks and throw their crap and everything. 
[00:07:30]  That's pretty much what you look like in a vehicle.  Yeah.  I'm just opening and slamming the door over and over again.  I'm not, I, I really think I did it about 20 times.  And then, then, uh, finally like a comm came over me and I was okay.  Acceptance.  Yeah.  I was okay with the world.  I hate that point.  I had a numb hand.  I lost all my CDs and I, who knows if I busted the driver's side door, I'll have to find out later.  I'll have to ask your making Mike, but, uh, and then I finally came into work just losing. 
[00:08:00]  I got into the office and the only thing that made me feel better was when you walked in just beyond pain.  I was so pissed off too.  Yeah.  I had gotten, uh, I'd gotten in pretty, pretty early, but then the last three blocks took me forever.  And I, I, I have a great respect, uh, for the, uh, NYPD here in, uh, New York.  Absolutely.  Um, but I do not enjoy the traffic cop people, not the police department, the traffic people, 
[00:08:30]  the people that direct traffic.  Sometimes they have regular own NYPD and they put the vest on them and they direct traffic.  And I listen to them.  I do not listen to the traffic people.  I hate those people.  They barely, they don't even speak English.  So I'm going to make, uh, my left turn to get to the road that, uh, takes me to the parking garage.  A mere 30 feet up that road.  It's funny you went down there because I gave up on that.  No.  I wasn't.  56, right?  Yeah.  The back way?  Yeah.  I go to make the left there.  And this, uh, guy, this traffic guy with his little vest goes, no turn.  I go, no turn. 
[00:09:00]  I'm turning.  He goes, no, straight.  He wants to send me down Broadway, which is a goddamn mess.  Uh, and I see the parking garage.  I go, dude, parking garage right there.  I'm going there.  He goes, no, you go straight.  So now I'm just pulling out everything.  I think I showed him a library card.  I'm like, look, I gotta go.  I'm going through.  I'm going through.  And I just start moving.  I started turning.  And he stepped out of the way.  And then, and then when he realized I was going, he goes, okay, go.  And waved me on.  I was not going to, uh, go down Broadway and sit in another, at least half hour of traffic. 
[00:09:30]  I'm amazed people are, are not killing each other on the, on the roadways.  Well, we're still, because we're to the point where, I don't know, traffic is going to just stop moving.  Yeah.  And then what?  We're, we're still kind of, uh, in that whole, we're together in this kind of, you know, let's pull through and let's, uh, uh, work together kind of phase.  We're still kind of in that.  But, uh, as more time goes on, you're going to see more people getting pissed off and maybe shooting people. 
[00:10:00]  I just want, I don't drive in often, because I gave up on that a while ago, as you could tell from today's story, that I just can't handle, handle this crap.  Like, like Anthony.  He handles it pretty well.  He yells and screams, but then he gets the job done.  He'll, you know, we've mentioned this on the show.  He'll, he'll drive on sidewalks.  I find the alternate routes that most people are unwilling to take.  I've seen him do some amazing moves.  How about going backwards on a, on a way, one way, 55 miles an hour?  Backing up the one way street is always a good thing.  55 miles an hour.  And then center medians on crowded highways are great. 
[00:10:30]  I will take that right to a, a bridge and then cut in.  And don't think you're going to bumper to bumper, uh, the guy in front of you to keep me from coming in.  Because I'm coming in.  Right.  Nothing you could do about it either.  Yeah.  I love that when they try to get, because I'll just keep going.  Because I know they're not going to, they're not going to let me hit their car.  So eventually they will stop.  I will just keep coming over on you.  No, I'm coming over.  And I rolled the window down and I put my finger down and go, I'm in here.  It's wonderful.  So I, you know, I, I take the nightmare ride from Long Island every once in a while. 
[00:11:00]  And I just know every time I take the ride, eventually between my house and where we broadcast in Midtown, Manhattan, I will get effed.  Yeah.  You just wonder, where are you going to get effed today?  Where is the construction crew trimming the trees on the side of the highway?  Because that is so important during the day.  Yeah, there shouldn't be any construction going on right now.  Well, that's all right.  Not when major roads are still closed.  All right.  Uh, Norton?  Just, uh, the tree in Midtown is a big problem. 
[00:11:30]  It's not just the police event today.  It's the stupid tree in Rockefeller Center.  And Voss bites his arm in traffic.  And I won't do anything bad to myself.  Yeah.  You're crazy.  So what I do is I travel with a small child and I just hit it.  Is that what you do?  Yeah.  You hear the screaming and it kind of makes you feel better.  Does Voss really bite himself?  He showed me scars on his arm from traffic.  I can relate to that.  Because it's weird.  I, I have to beat myself up sometimes and then I feel good.  And I'll have pains and everything. 
[00:12:00]  But I feel better.  I don't get it.  All right.  Whatever works for you.  Without a doubt.  Brandy, what's going on?  Hi, how are y'all?  Hi.  Oh, no.  Where are you from, Brandy?  New Orleans.  New Orleans.  I love it.  So we're on to New Orleans.  Yes, I are.  Right on.  When are y'all coming down here?  Mardi Gras.  No joke.  The Super Bowl is the weekend before Mardi Gras.  Yeah, we might have to spend the whole goddamn week.  Two weeks.  Yeah, no, we're coming down for the Super Bowl, too.  Okay. 
[00:12:30]  All right.  Well, listen to us for like a week or so and then call us and tell us what you think, okay?  Or as Rick says, 20 minutes.  Oh, yeah.  Or, yeah.  Yeah, our producer once said that if you're not laughing in 20 minutes and you have the  wrong station, you should go to New Orleans.  You'll get to know us and either love us or hate us, but you'll feel compelled to listen  for some stupid reason.  All right, Brandy.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  There's nothing really to say to her.  No.  She doesn't know us or the show.  No.  She'll learn.  Was that kind of weird?  It's like, hey, what's up?  Bill, what's up, man?  Hey, Bill. 
[00:13:00]  Bill?  Bill?  We got to be patient, Opie.  Be patient.  He's from New Orleans.  What is?  Hey, Bill.  Bill!  Congratulations.  The first stupid call from New Orleans.  Opie, be patient.  Bill!  It's a brand new city.  Oh, yeah.  Bill?  Hey, Bill.  You know, eight or ten, I'll put them below the grade.  Pretty much get rid of the whole stump.  He's doing some stump removal, I believe.  Hey, Bill. 
[00:13:30]  Bill, he's talking.  His phone is on.  He's talking to other people.  Thanks for the call, Bill.  Got him on hold.  Leave him there.  See how long he'll...  That'll be a trivia question someday.  What was the name of the first stupid phone call from New Orleans?  Ah, poor guy.  Trying.  He wanted to say that.  We're not saying New Orleans, right?  Exactly.  The first thing I noticed is it's New Orleans.  New Orleans.  You're sounding out every letter.  What?  You're sounding out every letter.  New Orleans.  New Orleans.  New Orleans. 
[00:14:00]  New Orleans.  New Orleans.  New Orleans.  New Orleans.  Nothing.  We got to take a break because we have a really busy show today.  Yeah, we'll get right into the O.J. thing.  Bunch of people calling.  They want to know if O.J. is here because they need to meet.  Yeah, I know.  O.J. in it again.  So we'll get into that a little bit today.  Believe it or not, Tom Brokaw is stopping by once again today.  Oh, my goodness.  Because Dan Rather is in the news again, and you don't want Dan one-upping Tom Brokaw.  Does he do it?  We'll talk about that. 
[00:14:30]  Also, we need to get more people for our What the Hell is That contest that is happening  Friday, and I think we still need another doctor or two to come down and help us with  the contest, okay?  Yes.  We'll have details in a bit.  Also, we're going to talk about the Homeless Shopping Spray.  That happens a week from today.  And more of your phone calls.  In New York, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including New Orleans.  866-2774.  Wow.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027-WNEW. 
[00:15:00]  Seven does freeze.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thanks for checking us out.  Everyone gets so defensive, Opie.  Huh?  Talking about driving and offensive driving.  Like, I like to practice, and I said, no one cuts in front of me, and if I want to get  in traffic, and I want to merge into a traffic jam, I will get in front of you, and there's  nothing you can do about it. 
[00:15:30]  There's this guy, Traeger, I guess, saying, you better not cut in front of me.  I have a perfect record defeating clowns like you.  Then he respects my taking alternate routes, sidewalks, media, et cetera.  But no, the truth of the matter is, I would get in front of you.  No one makes me their bitch on the highway.  That's what I consider it.  If you're in traffic, and somebody pulls a move and gets in front of you, they just made  you their bitch.  And if you let somebody block you and not get in front of them, they've again made you 
[00:16:00]  their bitch.  Doesn't happen with me, pal.  I don't care.  I got a goddamn lease.  I don't care what it looks like when I throw it back on.  Believe me.  People are like, oh, I'll take my 66 Cutlass, and I don't care.  Dude, it comes down to balls.  I'll hit you.  I don't care.  But cars, other cars weren't the problem today.  It was just gridlock today, where you're just not moving, and you watch traffic lights  go, green, yellow, red, green, yellow, red, green, yellow, red, and you're not moving.  And I just start going nuts in my head. 
[00:16:30]  I just lose it.  Frank, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Opie.  You know, I've been meaning to buy Disturbed the Sickness.  I was wondering what day you're going to be throwing that out your car and what center  I should be on.  Ben is really pissed off, because I'm not really sure if the U2 CD made it.  He's really pissed.  You all right, Ben?  No.  Thank you, Frank.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  I'm glad I went out of my way to let you get that, to use that. 
[00:17:00]  Now I can't.  Well, when I'm working on my one connection to get it again, because you trashed someone  on another stage.  Ben, when I'm raging, I'm not sitting there thinking which CDs I need to keep, which ones  I need to throw.  What makes you throw?  I get pissed when I drive, but I don't throw CDs out the window.  It's called, it's a mini nervous breakdown that you have in the privacy of your own vehicle.  It's like a driving breakdown.  You actually have some type of mental breakdown in your car.  I've done it.  You ever scream and make a sound like some nut rocking in their own feces in a mental  institution? 
[00:17:30]  I've done that.  I've been in the car and you just go, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  You're hitting things.  You hit your own head, ah, ah, ah.  He's going crazy.  Yeah, Ben, I get pissed when I, dude, I was driving down 6th Avenue last week and a cab cut  me off and I said something to the effect of, you know, get the F out of this country type  thing but i wouldn't take which is you know whatever it is but i wouldn't take and throw cds  out the window and you were probably you were what on 57th street not moving so what does that 
[00:18:00]  do you throw it'd be funny if you were like moving like 30 and throw them out you threw them out  you gotta throw them at somebody no i know i just i smashed them to the ground no you gotta throw  them at and you know what i think it's more dangerous to tell a cabbie to get out of the  country than to beat yourself up why because you don't know what that guy can do it's true i i turn  into uh i know what i can do i know what i can do to myself but i don't know what other people  gonna do to me i say it with the windows rolled up exactly hey you insert bad racial epithet here 
[00:18:30]  you know it gets bad because you know something you come down to a very primal thing when you're  in that situation it's anger and it's very primal so when you pull up next to the person that just  effed you uh you don't go hey you lousy driver you'll insert whatever language is appropriate  for either his race or sex or or whatever else comes in and don't tell me everybody doesn't do  it it's just as long as your windows are rolled up i don't know how many times a fine maybe asian

[00:29:30]  them we'll be like oh who invited them i know we do that all the time uh oj's lawyer anthony no drugs  on oj we know that the focus of the case has to do with ecstasy and an ongoing drug investigation  the agents that were here were part of an ongoing colombian drug task force there were no ecstasy  pills any cocaine or any type of illegal narcotic that was found in mr simpson's home  but why is oj involved oj's somehow involved in operation x operation x joe what's up hey joe joe 
[00:30:00]  joe joe whatever you're on the radio joe oh no it's short you got the wrong name what's up  yeah oj's a doctor yeah yeah he's gone from operating on his ex to operation x graduated  medical school this week operation x yeah and i did some throat surgery on the call all right guys  you guys suck i'm gonna go listen to myself in philly in another five minutes all right sean thank 
[00:30:30]  you i just love the fact that uh the cops don't leave oj alone whether it's his uh road rage or uh  this ecstasy thing or or uh domestic abuse it's just great i they don't they just have to pound this  guy all the time he killed people jason jason from philly what's up hey what's going on  what's going on hey hey i was just calling that oj man what an idiot that guy can't stay out of the  nuke yeah i don't know if he's an idiot though we can't catch him for anything the teflon oh the 
[00:31:00]  teflon all right nothing he's a good idiot you know he throws everybody's mind off of the taliban  all right jason thank you oh osama bin laden no that's the oh i was talking about  john what's going on hey how you doing johnny conference the slogan is going to be  if it was he it couldn't have been he that's good i'll remember that all right  all right thank you uh what's this money laundering thing the lawyers i don't know i guess when you 
[00:31:30]  sell a lot of drugs you got to launder the cash and uh somehow oj's involved in money i can assure you  that mr simpson doesn't have enough cash in his pocket or in his bank account to ever be involved  in any type of money laundering there were no and i repeat no ecstasy pills found in mr simpson's home  or in his automobile or on his person you know where all blood was found during the last case and never 
[00:32:00]  will be involved in any type of illegal drug use dealing or sale hey there you go  how could this lawyer uh even shut his eyes to take a nap never mind sleep jose's got this guy jose's  got some uh info for us jose hey what's up what up uh supposedly they um i guess the cops i got in the 
[00:32:30]  tape from uh i don't know i guess a drug dealer or a sting and apparently oj's name got mentioned  like three times as a part of the ecstasy ring in florida so they decided to go visit his house  yesterday and search his house for like six hours they must have been so bummed they couldn't find  anything all right all right jose thank you pete from boston they'll never find ecstasy in oj's house  because if there's one thing oj's good at it's getting rid of the x already coming in the jokes 
[00:33:00]  uh here's oj's lawyer talking about the satellite dishes the second part of this damn thing that's  going on i think you would all realize and appreciate the fact that this warrant was not  about a satellite dish or cart that mr simpson may have normally in law enforcement here in the southern  district you know we don't have 30 or 40 fbi agents raid someone's house because there's an 
[00:33:30]  allegation that they have a uh satellite card that they shouldn't have illegal cable oh now i am in  trouble well don't we all have a one satellite card everybody have maybe a channel they shouldn't be  getting the black box is that really a bootleg satellite card is that really a problem now what is  this last one oj's lawyer talking about uh lawyer pissed about the pot leak yeah uh i guess there was  a report that one of the fbi agents leaked that they found pot ah someone said they found pot in oj's 
[00:34:00]  house all right what about the marijuana there was no marijuana found in the house who told you that brian  hearing that's a different federal agency why i'd like to know who you heard that from because first  of all if you heard that from a federal agent or authority it would be in direct violation of a court  order and they will be they will be held in contempt of court hold on there was no there was no marijuana 
[00:34:30]  found in the house was it on oj was it in his car what you know lawyers have a way of doing that  none found in the house in the house in the house it was in the garage i don't know i like this lawyer  actually to be honest with you yeah yeah man he's dirtbags in the media he's slamming them i like this  guy though hate him i didn't do nothing again there you go oj with the e oj with the e i'm going to

[00:38:30]  of the song or the line is uh cold as ice in the background you hear you know that's ice ice baby  like a lady gonna mention ice baby and be serious about it it's just kind of cool save it for the  concert i think it's fun they didn't need to put it on the cd the cd rocks i i think the one song  that there's only one song i really don't like on that and it's kind of that hip-hop one  plates on your ass what the hell is what the hell is putting plates on your ass anyway does anyone know 
[00:39:00]  what that is it's kind of old school we could ask some of the brothers they'll help i remember i  remember on a beavis and butthead episode uh uh beavis was psyched about that yeah put some plates on  her ass and like he's all psyched about it but i don't know what it means it probably means that the  girl's got boots or it might yeah maybe that i think it has to do with smacking that ass though  or something i'm gonna go with that the girl has a burr a bootay look at him a big butt that goes like  this it has a shelf which is all plates and that's that's hot in the ghetto i don't know it seems to me 
[00:39:30]  like it's more of a brutalizing thing than just a uh oh yeah what are they in uh spin magazine spin  magazine has a little story on them and uh gorillas yeah naming you two uh what the band of the year  duh i know jim norton hates you two why do you hate you two just don't like them why never did  you gotta respect the band that's been around for 20 years i don't i don't want to hear his 
[00:40:00]  liberal rants dropping dropping plates on your ass dropping plates on your ass biatch i'd rather i'd  rather see him swing when i go to shows you're right you're right about that gets a little too  political speeches in between songs i'd rather just see him rock i want to see ozzy running around  and just screaming we love you that's what i want to see i don't want to be told  ozzy doesn't even know he's on the stage that's why i like him exactly look at this guy jared  disturbed is such a gay band oh i'm so scared because they're so disturbed all these gay new 
[00:40:30]  metal bands suck listen to real metal bands like megadeth pantera and slayer dude dude it's it's i  understand you know you could kick back listen to some uh megadeth pantera i don't mind crank it  down megadeth every once in a while absolutely but you know something that guy who would think  that megadeth pantera and slayer fans would be the the closed mind people that wouldn't accept newer  music like they were the outcasts uh uh years ago well disturbs kind of uh they're a bit corporate 
[00:41:00]  they're pretty heavy i don't know man they just rock i don't care what the hell they do true  they kick ass uh really fast before we move on anthony yeah so uh we get in the other day the uh  limp biscuit remix cd yeah i i mean i don't have to tell you i mean you're the same way huge limp  biscuit fans you know for the most part well yeah i mean seeing fred turn up on every other goddamn  project is kind of well but when you got it weird but when you got into the band you didn't know that's  the way he was going to go true yeah but i was pretty excited to listen to this uh limp biscuit 
[00:41:30]  remix cd oh my god it blows biggest piece of crap this year i put it in on saturday i love  limp biscuit i put it on saturday is that going to be in a review in the paper with quotes big  spots biggest piece of crap dude i we were steve open i was like all right cool because we were all  he was driving a boss i was driving a boss i'm thinking this is gonna be perfect cruising music  i'm gonna just crank it up different versions of all the songs they slowed it down turned them 
[00:42:00]  into hip-hop songs nookie they do like it's like a puffy like nookie version that we don't have a  copy laying around now we gotta get now we gotta play a little bit i did break mine today in uh that  little uh road rage breakdown because now i gotta hear a little ghetto nookie it's a bunch of hardcore  rappers redid all the limp biscuit songs like limp biscuits known for adding this these really crunchy  hooky guitars and it's hip-hop stuff they took it all away yeah oh yeah it's like pizza with no  crust yeah i was expecting all the guitar work and stuff no guitars and you got a hamburger you got 
[00:42:30]  to get yeah yeah and they wanted pizza but uh i give them an a for effort for trying something  different no but i don't know maybe they just owed a record to the the record company that's entirely  possible there's there's all these rumors and speculation that west borland isn't in the band  anymore he's gone right he's gone well who knows i mean they're between albums but i mean  it could be fred durst trying to get in good with the rap community it could be any number  of well he does seem to uh uh uh really get into that there's also there's one good remix on that 
[00:43:00]  disc and it's the one but i'm disgusted he goes yo what's up yeah that's how ozzy spoke that's how  geezer butler spoke you know yeah exactly what's up yo shut up stupid all right uh ben's giving me  the limp biscuit the uh nookie oh this is just this is horrendous let's hear some ghetto nookie uh  this is the remix uh nookie remixed by the neptunes  hey uh little mama how are you doing what is that how are you doing 
[00:43:30]  and i don't want you to be my kid but uh  when does it start sounding like nookie that's what i was thinking when i threw it in the car i  didn't even know what song i was like what is this i had to grab the cd case and go what uh what  song is this one two freddie j i came into this world as a reject looking to the eyes then you'll  see the size of the plan falling on the path it's burning in my brain everyone that burns has to learn  from the pain hey i think about the day my journey ran away with my pay my fellas came to play now she's 
[00:44:00]  stuck but my homie said she fucked and i'm just a sucker with the lump in my throat like a chomp  yeah like a chomp like a chomp like a chomp like a chomp like a chomp like a chomp  yeah all the uh guitar is like everything that made it kind of because uh limp biscuit's always been  kind of rock rap you know what i mean what i'm rock part gone now it just might as well what i like 
[00:44:30]  about like this because it's one of those uh bands when you're cranking your car you feel like  hurting somebody right you know what i mean you're just there's a lot of energy and i don't really  feel like  it's kind of sad i'm the laughing stock in the neighborhood and you would think that i've been  moving on but i'm gonna pop it like a fan fucked up in the head not maybe she just made a mistake  and not to give her a break my heart will hate either way hey what the hell what you want me to say  that doesn't have the impact man where's the you need the energy when that kicks in 
[00:45:00]  on the regular version it's like you know that's great hammer what's up  yeah what's up man hey yeah yo that new biscuits that just that's horrible i mean seriously man  how can you go out and play a play a good rocking show and then come out with something like that on  a cd the fans should be disgusting that's a little a little weird all right in fact with all the music 
[00:45:30]  now what's up with all these great hit volumes it's just for the holidays or something yeah most  likely of course they got to get a product out all right just to take more money from us i think  richard cheese does a better version of nookie uh enjoying on my way in today loudly master  reality by sabbath wow 71 no rap making it old school no ozzy d stupid nonsense break up your mind 
[00:46:00]  your rap or your rock just be one and stop sucking god no noise i think the rap rock  that's going away that's going away fast now yeah rock big but uh and here's limp biscuit from  the same cd doing break stuff the remix this is break stuff wow it's not like destiny's child  did i get it no i didn't i got to pull it out 
[00:46:30]  stay away mother there you go  oh go on you missed it you missed the ass i missed the i missed the ass all right i will say the the 
[00:47:00]  limp biscuit version of that song is really good that's a good song yeah that's what i was on  you know killer song this thing stinks someone's saying they're only selling this uh through telemarketing  is that true no no this is in stores that's in stores no one one one new way that they're selling  albums now is they're selling them through 800 numbers it's just a new way the uh the record  companies are trying to compete with the immediacy of the internet they want to be able to deliver it the 
[00:47:30]  day it comes out right right there's only one good track on it it's butch vig doing nookie that's  yeah that's cool that's the one i made a rejoiner for you guys with that's that's the only good  track on this thing and there's still no guitars but at least it's it's usable butch vig is aight  smoky what's up from harlem hey what's going on fellas i just want to weigh in on how weak this  album is yeah uh i'm more of a hip-hop fan and to be honest with you neptunes do some good stuff like  they had that uh miss go shake your shake it fast song yeah they do some good stuff but when limp 
[00:48:00]  biscuits tries to cross over i mean stick to your core i mean don't try to do new things with it  just doesn't work out it doesn't please anybody that's true that's it guys i just want you guys  do a great job love you guys later all right thank you speaking of crossing over uh no doubt yeah when  is gwen stefani just gonna you know tell the band it's over uh what do you think what do you mean there  is no band left there you don't think oh my god that latest song yeah uh what does it go uh uh

[00:49:00]  girls that uh like going to see no doubt you know and um this drummer just jumps out from behind his  drum kit at the end of the night completely balls naked and just stands there on the stage as they  take their bows and whatnot and there's these girls getting their first glimpse of man junk that's a  little odd and they arrested morrison yeah right oh my god no i she she won't uh she won't leave  that band there's no band though left with that you don't think not at all especially that new song

[01:01:00]  listened to bands that just drone on and on and they go dude let's just jam for the last 20 minutes  of rehearsal and you're sitting there listening to it's something that would would be exactly what  you'd hear from fish and the dead it's just nonsense that goes on and on it doesn't stop you  don't like i need structure to my music relax a little bit of structure all right and do you  come up with a hook you freak do you do you enjoy any songs over four minutes long do you like any  jams i uh you know something if you want to delve back into the old ancient days i could listen to 
[01:01:30]  some yes that's what i would do i would smoke a lot of pot listen to yes something like that yes one  song on one side of an album a lot of technical stuff going on there too technical for me yeah i  i wouldn't listen to it now how about you go to a black crow at the time how about you go to a  black crow show and they do like a 10 12 minute version of like remedy or something you know i  could probably squeak by on that because it's a hit you're all right got a hook something and i'm  gonna hear some songs i know they get a little different when she talks to angels are you are  you sitting i don't like it and listen to these jazz blues riff things that people are just jamming to 
[01:02:00]  for 20 30 minutes what are you got it's like sitting through a goddamn drum solo but don't you  drummers call up now because they suck hold on solos stink you're you mean to tell me you didn't  enjoy when van halen used to do their solo thing did michael anthony really need 20 minutes to show  his bass playing skills on his jack daniels base our bass player wrote this jazz odyssey 
[01:02:30]  we can't do a free-form jazz odyssey in front of a festival crowd  i'm with you spinal tap mark four i'm with you with the whole van halen thing oh god that stuff  stinks it's that was that was bathroom break beer break you know what one by one they would come out  and do like yeah 10 minutes on their own oh they always start with the drums right yeah yeah  yeah yeah alex van halen would start going with his drums and spinning around and we had the bass 
[01:03:00]  and then the bass and eddie would get it going by that time you felt you know you were like oh  eddie had come out and then the sammy days as sammy would have to do the guitar part and eddie would  play along with it and oh shut up it's self-serving and it doesn't uh do anything for the crowd that's  there it's just like old fish thing they enjoy it they want to get up there and jam because it's  fun for them and for some reason they've uh hypnotized their audience through drugs or whatever 
[01:03:30]  other means psychic uh connections that uh they sit and and uh uh listen to this but i i can't be  bothered about uh drum solo moby dick anthony no no drum solos suck moby dick you know what almost  good moby dick on the album fine you know live how long that must have went on 20 minutes forget about  it 20 minutes yeah ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding and you know he's  going from like the smallest highest pitch drum all the way down to the lowest one it's going to take 
[01:04:00]  him forever oh enough get to the big bass one and let's finish let's go to manny manny what's up  manny hello oh man let's go uh yeah i wonder if norton likes grunge grunge no i never liked grunge  never liked it nirvana when nirvana first hit never like alice and chains i didn't like them  you're a freak i'm not i'm not how could you not like the pain in lane staley's voice i'm not familiar 
[01:04:30]  with alice and chains i don't know any of their music if i do someone like someone like you would love  alice okay maybe i'm not familiar with i know who they are not familiar with the music wow i'm  telling you i'm being honest and i never liked nirvana mud honey what's that really old school  pretty much the first grunge band well one of them nirvana actually no uh what was that what was that  one uh band there uh yeah mother love bone who's that nice that was like the band that that brought the 
[01:05:00]  whole hair band thing to the grunge that was like the ah that that was the band that was the bridge between  hair bands and grunge rock guy died i'm not interested guy died of an od uh just when he was  about to be huge and then they fought well jim what was it andrew wood lead singer andrew wood right  you don't know alice and chains come on man in the box  this rocks right norton you gotta respect a guy that cannot record anymore because he weighs 80 pounds 
[01:05:30]  he's just drugged out hypodermic needles in his arms at all times the band has been trying to get this  guy together for years and he just can't do it something like guns and roses what oh no that's  just that yeah now there's a lot more to allison chains than just throwing it away and saying they  sound like freaking axel and guns and roses you you really do wow one more and we got to move on ed 
[01:06:00]  what's up hey what's up man hey hey norton man i agree with you since sabbath broke up the only  good music is ozzy music thank you ed you're right there are these people that are out there it's  great anybody else believes anything else they think their mother's knee curtains are tight too man  although i've been black sabbath forever dude heaven and hell mob rules and live evil were good

[01:14:30]  a camera inside you to see what uh happened mm-hmm how much of the camera were you able to take  i think it was going that way was it going the mouth or the other way they uh they used it through  my mouth oh they didn't put the camera the other way no well i have a question for you is it true  that they wanted you to work harder so they're going to do a melanin extraction did they replace  your batteries earl i think the other ones are running out oh we shouldn't abuse earl he's in the 
[01:15:00]  hospital bed so when are you getting out earl uh hopefully thursday thursday are you on some good  painkillers right now i'm on nothing um i'm on my second bag of blood but other than them blood  oh because you lost blood through your ulcer yeah wow uh they just do a blood transfusion are you  crapping in a bedpan earl no you get up and go to the bathroom um no they gave me a nice little uh

[01:16:30]  so i'm just kind of keeping it on the down why if this isn't like a big thing are you in icu  i have no idea you'd have no idea why you're in the intensive care unit wouldn't that be a question  you would ask your doctor say doc i looked at the door i see that i'm in the intensive care  unit with people that uh might drop dead why am i here probably because he lost a lot of blood right  earl is that it yeah because it's almost all this is related to the blood loss to the blood loss all

[01:20:30]  uh around here like a sloth that uh when he lost all that blood and his blood pressure dropped and  it didn't really affect him physically because he had been training for that his whole life  it's only from long island earl sounds like he is at a sticker stop  yeah that's the same where all we get at a sticker stop and he's supposed to be energetic laying in  icu johnny g from around the corner stacking plates refers to a high riding ass that you can stack  plates on that's what we kind of yeah but any song i've ever heard of all it sounds like something

[01:22:30]  guy had yeah only the thing is i know what it is i've been to a doctor about it what is it it well  the hair growing thing i don't have but i have something called a varicocele and it's like out  a vein or two veins tied together there's like a knot and the blood can't get through so the blood just  collects and you've got these veins that are just like filled with blood they dumped out of that all  that all right all right wow looks like grandma's uh leg with all the veiny that's great so so the 
[01:23:00]  blood just collects yes what do you do for that sir well um i went well i first discovered it when i  was like 14. i was in the eighth grade and i thought it was like a tumor so i went straight to the doctor  and he sent me to the urologist and they found it out he recommended surgery you can have it surgically  corrected and uh but then the insurance company if you're going to get a surgery they make you get 
[01:23:30]  a second opinion so i went to a second urologist and then he said you don't need surgery it doesn't  harm you in any way so then i had to go get a third opinion and they said well you can but it doesn't  really matter and so the only thing is it can affect fertility but not bad and i found out  subsequently yeah that both my grandfather and my uncle on my mom's side had it and my grandfather  has five kids and he never had it fixed who told your grandma it's always great grabbing on a grandpa's 
[01:24:00]  big bulging varicose yam bag well my uncle had it fixed and he's got three kids so you know i just  left the one i want to get unnecessary surgery and it's not because they hold on hold on hold on  we should you know something we should be able to say that yeah but i don't trust it's very clinical  but i don't trust me either you're saying when you're uh ready to go sexually let's just say  because you know the yams rise up right so you know yams rise up so the you know the girls can't

[01:30:00]  for all i i i like uh remixes but when i think limp biscuit remix i'm thinking it's going to be  balls to the wall and it was more hip-hoppy and a little too slow for my taste that's because that's  the direction you know forever i'm going i mean that's why i mean we got you got the neptune you  got timbo you know i mean i mean we all we got everybody did their own thing you know what i mean  it was like everybody going through their track go on the lab come back to something nice it's like  it's like taking but taking out the the guitars and the rock part well y'all don't know i'm i don't

[01:45:30]  thing it looks like a i don't know like a golf ball it's kind of hairy and it's uh right by my balloon  knot area and i swear i'm definitely afraid to go but i'm just i i'm afraid you know all right it looks  like a fuzzy golf ball where are you calling from philly dude where like is it exactly right next to it  i mean it's like i took a mirror you know what it looked like because the first time i was just 
[01:46:00]  like a little piece of skin or something but then it started getting bigger and bigger it's a golf ball  so that's that well i'd say a little bit smarter yeah like a big jawbreaker bring in one of your  drivers maybe you could remove it and he just swing away how many nuclear power plants are in philly  i tried cutting it off with a pair of clip toenail clippers we're getting what you want yeah i tried  you know clipped it off with a pair of toenail clippers i don't mean pretty bad when it was how  big uh when it was like the size of a marble oh and it's now bigger i sucked on it like some candy 
[01:46:30]  that sounds like a smart way to handle it though sal will you come up from uh philly to be part of  what the hell is that what yeah absolutely i'll definitely be there we got beer and everything  it's gonna be a little party and you'll be with people that you can relate with too are they all  gonna be watching me do this or is it gonna be like a just me and a doctor or something ah  we set it up whatever don't worry about that all right privacy all right man all right oh we got 
[01:47:00]  the guy that has the rotting corneas on the line take his info okay this is looking good as long as  these people don't blow us off like last week come on man we're syndicated now we gotta look cool for  everybody yeah say you're coming down come down right right speaking of uh uh my driver anthony yeah  i still i i i i need to do that bet by the way no you will will not be doing opie has this uh  uh well very vivid imagination he he believes at some point he is going to be able to go to the 
[01:47:30]  roof of this very building which is how how how tall is this building five 40 story yeah  are we up to 50 is it 50 something it's less than 50 it's a pretty it's it's a very tall building  around where we are you know who's obsessed with this bet by the way is our own uh ken stevens oh  really he's willing to let me try this there is no way you can try this there's no way to try it  because it is dangerous here's what opie wants to do we are on 57th street central park is three three 
[01:48:00]  blocks up it's three blocks away it's two 58 and 59 58 59 is central park's out yeah he's right  two blocks two blocks i could do this hold on one two it's two it's two short blocks yeah yeah there  is that little it's like double blocks 57th street is a two-way street as well as central park west 
[01:48:30]  exactly what do you want to sell for us so they will explain it he wants to go to the roof i'm  dead serious by the way he wants to go to the roof of this building tia smack a golf ball he says he  can hit central park i don't have to hit the middle of central park i just have to get the the edge  why is that even an idea exactly he's insane there is no way you could pull this off there's no way  you could legally do this why the boss is into it it would kill somebody it would absolutely 
[01:49:00]  kill somebody you don't know that you'd knock out one of the goddamn horses that are pulling the  carriages or around the park you don't know that hit a tourist why don't you just do it with a bowling  ball and see if you can throw that into central park but we're trying to figure out how far we're  trying to figure out how far it is from the roof to uh the edge of the park and i i i said it's no more  than like 220 yards that's doable you think 220 well from from this high up you're going to have a lot more  forward movement exactly that's why i would it's guaranteed i could do it and there's no buildings 
[01:49:30]  in my way yeah if you slice it no big deal just a golf ball plummeting 500 feet you'll share you'll  probably shank the thing through the window on the building next to us ben is weird though whack he's  really freaked out about this you can't do it it's not cool you can go to why don't you go to chelsea  piers you go four stories up four stories up at chelsea piers it's boring it's boring bye-bye to  opie's little radio show bye-bye at opie's car bye-bye opie what if i do it what if i do it late 
[01:50:00]  at night there's always people around new york there's oh yeah yeah yeah we'll set up someone to  catch it there is no way to do that if if if tiger woods wanted to do this  it there would have to be so much done to prepare where they close off uh half of manhattan to drive  a golf ball from the roof of a 40-story building we weren't supposed to towards central we weren't  supposed to broadcast this oh that way no one would know who did it exactly all right then we won't 
[01:50:30]  talk about it now so when we do it kind of no one will know kind of like when uh uh the priest in  the caddyshack gets hit by the lightning and bill murray is he just walked away he just walked away  because no one really cigarette boy opie on the uh 48 floors he lines up this last shot tears in his  eyes i guess oh we got a lot of that oh wait it's a police officer what are you gonna do you can't  the boss is into it though i would like to know physically if it could be done that's why i think 
[01:51:00]  i i said i think it can be done three swings too i get three swings wait a minute just in case i  doff one i want to know exactly how far it is this calls for the old billy barule  yeah let me down billy 38 000  anthony aren't you a risk-taker 
[01:51:30]  but his whole place sucks that's right it sucks  you need the risk involved the Ben's like oh just go to Chelsea Piers and see if you can hit it that  far who cares it's boring let me tell you something I like the risk factor Evel Knievel had risk I  want to know how far it is if it's if it's 300 yards or less you can make it right because you're  talking about forward motion you you smack that thing you're going to get a lot further just for 
[01:52:00]  the fact that it's got a it's got more room to fall as it's going forward a little not even 200 yards  not even you know that I don't think it's 200 yards even 200 I would bet a lot of money that  it's over 220 yards where's Earl with the tape measure oh damn sorry we can measure it someday  I would say it's at least to walk it off someone pace it off because two blocks is like a tenth of  a mile so Rick I caddy for a really long time and this is how about winning that caddy tournament 
[01:52:30]  and this is how obsessive this is how obsessive I am about this uh stunt I've already kind of like  you know I kind of scoped it out I'm telling you it's 220 yards at least 220 then you can make it  can't you do something safer like maybe throw a Chinese star what if we broadcast the whole thing  so everyone you know has a heads up yeah that's good they would have to close and and and move  vehicles and close roads and stop pedestrians and buildings would have to be blocked off and like 
[01:53:00]  like I said if Tiger Woods wanted to do this it would cost millions to do and be this huge thing  uh you know you're not going to just hop up on the roof uh throw throw some of the rooftop  gravel in the air to see which way the wind's blowing and and take a swing why do I share with  you guys I should have just went up there and and and and well you should have a driver right  in right in the office why don't you just fling an envelope with white powder and see if you can 
[01:53:30]  hit Central Park it's an awful idea top story terrorism strikes the heart of New York City as uh  the Taliban seems to be using golf balls oh well that sucks when somebody walked up to the body  picked up the golf ball and said anyone playing a titleist we knew there was a problem uh Amy  hey hey what's up I'm just calling you guys about Leanne I think that was the name the girl with the 
[01:54:00]  leaky the leaky you know what yes situation yeah she has got to be seen by your guy's doctor do you  have doctors coming down uh I don't know Rick do we have doctors coming down yeah why what do you  think we have enough doctors see that is a symptom of it's the main symptom of something extremely  serious so I hope she's I don't know I hope the doctor takes it seriously all right well we'll find  out good we'll find out on Friday yeah definitely have her checked out I hope she comes down okay  okay thank you Dan Dan from Hoboken doing some of the math if two blocks is a tenth of a mile 
[01:54:30]  two blocks is a tenth of a mile two blocks a one-tenth of a mile he said that's uh 528 feet  under 200 yards doable it's so doable I already know it's doable I just gotta you know make sure  I don't duff it look who the hell just farted dude anyone no it wasn't me get John in here  it wasn't me it wasn't me it walked in here what the and he thought no one would notice you smell it 
[01:55:00]  over there Jim no I wouldn't mind you smelled it right John what is wrong with John today this is  like the tenth thing with him he comes running in with his do you smell it now right how bad is that  where is he go that's such a lie Norton was it you Rick unless it was you and when the door  flung open the whole wind kind of just knocked it over I wish it was me John was that you nope 
[01:55:30]  swear to God dude I was in here for two seconds how much of an impact I've made you know what  if I thought I would admit it who farted admit it I didn't don't be pussies you normally I always  admit it it's either Rick or John I wish that was my pussy everybody else admit that look how proud  somebody could be of that far I would have waved it at you was it Rachel oh yeah I like it I like  saying I did that mine mine I did that now someone's doing the map quest for me uh 50 
[01:56:00]  yeah I'm over here yeah but what is this means nothing to me isn't there a legend on there of  of distance okay hold on hold on let's go let's go 300 feet 300 feet would be a block it's 600 feet  it's 200 I'm I'm right on I'm telling you it's it's well I said what 220 where are we we're right  here 57th you gotta remember the sidewalk Ant right edge of the building is uh you know behind the 
[01:56:30]  sidewalk 600 yeah that's like 220 I will bet money that this thing is uh 220 within uh within  within seven yards either way I will take that then that's an easy thing especially from 40 stories  up all right then it's gonna clear the buildings then then all we have to worry about is hitting  someone in Central Park all right if um if you could hit it straight which I don't know I've seen 
[01:57:00]  your swing you can get a lot of distance but sometimes you go a little yeah I hear the trees  I'm a monster with my driver monster another person that could do this cowbell bill yeah bill bill's got  a hell of a swing bill could easily do it hmm see a lot of people now challenge they don't think I  could do it now I gotta do it I gotta do it do you think you could get it past Central Park uh the the  road in there no way center drive no no that is you add another 200 feet uh 300 feet onto that 
[01:57:30]  it's another 100 that's 300 yards that's 300 yards and you're 40 stories up that's the bet yeah but  like I I remember physics it starts dropping fast like it like it's not once the arc goes right once  it hits the point where it's just dropping straight down then your height doesn't matter exactly but  I think you might be able to push 300 yards from 40 stories up maybe you're not high enough goddamn  swing at this thing top of the Empire State Building maybe aim for Washington Heights the 
[01:58:00]  worst idea I've ever heard I'm kind of liking it now I'm kind of getting into it oh yeah there's a  lot of people into this bet we're just trying to figure out how I can pull it off from the top of  the building it's 40 stories it's only 220 yards tops 220 to the park I guarantee you hit the park  I want you to get it past the road the road which is which is another another uh 100 uh yards 
[01:58:30]  that's 300 yards you've hit what 260 I can hit that far easily and then give you you tack on the  the height I think you might squeak 300 out of it that's the bet that I want to see what is Tiger  Woods average uh oh he's just an animal what's he hit I don't know I don't even uh uh over 300  times he's hit over three but what about that drunk what the hell was his name John Daly  god damn that guy had a pair of mitts on him huh that guy could hit it that guy could go over  central park he'll hit tavern on the green know who I used to caddy for that drink there that was a 
[01:59:00]  nightmare Clark Gillies oh really the old islander yeah he could monster drives but the problem with  him was I mean he could he could hit him over 300 but he hit him about a mile high as well  yeah and as a skinny little caddy he would ask where's my golf ball son am I crinkle crinkle  so I would start walking I'd start walking to the right side of the fairway and he'd be walking to  the left like stupid kid doesn't even know where my ball is funny going like a loser 
[01:59:30]  bleachy breath and tear stained little face all right all right I'm not saying just use a WBCN  golf ball what the hell would that do I don't get still get blamed for that there might be a joke  there somewhere I have to use a uh all right listen competing stations golf ball if you're on hold  because you want to be part of what is what the hell is that that's cool we'll we'll we'll pre-interview  you and see if you're worthy for uh coming down here to get diagnosed on Friday okay yeah uh we don't  talk to everyone on the air as far as that goes and um we gotta talk uh talk to Tom Brokaw next 
[02:00:00]  Anthony ah yes he's a little pissed off pull your pants down can I see your taint whipped cream  lesbian can we see your butt let me tell you about my balloon nut the opium anthony show radio's own  slaggy you're checking out the opium anthony show we're on in new islands new islands first day  how you doing for that place in louisiana we got a couple calls at the beginning of the show and 
[02:00:30]  nonsense so yeah oh well let's go to kevin from the nypd kevin oh be you too how the hell are you  gonna pull this this thing off with the golf balls why first of all we're gonna get to spot you down  in the park when that thing comes flying through the trees and no one knows who you know where or when  it's gonna come down or whatever that's just it it's a little bit of the challenge wait a minute  you do have the retarded laverne and shirley available for that i think it's gonna be pretty 
[02:01:00]  obvious that it hits the park from the roof well you gotta be have somebody down there to to clear  people away or whatever you know what the true odds are of it really hitting a person it's pretty slim  or a vehicle it could happen but better not come through my the window of my uh radio car  no i'm talking like if it hits central park the odds that it hits a person are very slim  yeah right at five between four and seven p.m yeah i love the fact that uh the nypd guy here has an 
[02:01:30]  open mind yeah he's not ruling it out completely he's like you know i hope your liability insurance  is paid up i want to know why a member of the nypd is concerning himself about some golf stunt  man you guys rule i'm telling you thanks captain all right norton bites all right yeah he does  all right we have erin on the line erin was uh the 19 year old mommy that did mommy what would  you do for britney spears tickets she has a four-year-old daughter the little hussy i like 
[02:02:00]  that though she's the grand prize winner yeah what she did for the britney spears tickets she sucked on  stalker patty's disgusting hammer toes her big toes she's got a hammer toe and a little uh offshoot  to her hammer toe she can't clip her big toenail because it hurts too much oh god it hurts make so  it's this huge picture when when you're at a public pool or something if you've ever seen this at a pool  or anything you look at someone's feet and see that disgusting huge big toenail picture that even 
[02:02:30]  more disgusting than the most disgusting one you've seen well erin had to then suck on that  toenail for uh sixty seconds and she did she had uh she had a nice technique by the way she had a  great technique erin yes hi so we're we're hearing rumors what happened to you after the uh the little  stunt on the show when i was on the train going home i was like i had the tongue i was still trying  to get that taste out of my mouth mystery and everything like that and i put the to my tongue 
[02:03:00]  on the top of my mouth and it was like cut from my teeth back oh man you had a cut on the roof of  your mouth from your teeth back to where like almost like all the way back to the roof of my mouth it  just cut like complete across stalker patty's toes scraped the roof of your mouth all the way to the bone  and then no but it gets worse i went to my boyfriend's like you got to go to the doctor i'm  not kissing you till you go to the doctor if you suck on those things i wouldn't kiss you and i went  to the doctor and i have a fungal infection in it oh my god wait a minute are you kidding me i'm dead

[02:04:00]  oh man wow that that sucks so so uh what did the doctor say did he say how did you do this and  well i told him i said i did it for the britney spears tickets he just sort of like laughed and said  you know you shouldn't put your people's feet in your mouth no matter what and did you have to  describe what her toenail looked like and what was under there i said that she had a hammer toe and it  was sort of like gross and you know there's dirt underneath and he said it was probably dirt she  probably has like foot fungus or something you got foot fungus in your mouth and i got it in my mouth

[02:24:30]  and it's like this poor son of a bitch can't even go  can't even beat it in his house  like he got in trouble in the movie theater  cranking it in the movie theater  now he can't even do it in the privacy of his home  they storm in and take his porno  jay moore  hey  what's up  what's up jay  let me tell you something  if i can get arrested for having porno in my house  i'm on death row  you might as well send me to oz  yeah you all start  you start thinking jesus christ  what kind of porno does it take  i think he had kitty porn or something  no they would have mentioned that if he had 
[02:25:00]  they're just  they're just on  you know  they've been following him and oj around for 10 years now  i think they did  and now they're saying that they also  searched that uh  uh rooney from ferris bueller  yeah the principal from ferris bueller  jeffrey jones  you know that guy  he has porno of mrs pool from the hogan family  mrs pool  listen to this  he had his house search for underage gay porn  after cops found material in uh  peewee herman's house  and this material pointed to uh the first bueller principle 
[02:25:30]  material in paul rubin's house pointed to jeffrey jones's house  that means it was a jpeg from  oh so maybe he had sent him porno  or maybe it's pictures of  looks like they're trading stuff  maybe there was a note with a little map  maybe  how to get to the rest of the gay underage porn  rooney you're a kid toucher  unbelievable  hey  it was saturday night live anthony  when the girl said  where do you  where are we supposed to allow this man to watch porn

[02:26:30]  we're rocking  hanging out man  i haven't talked to you in too long  i watched the uh rerun of your appearance on conan  last night  how was it  it was so funny to watch you go  now it's mine  oh they rerun that one  yeah i was dying  i better look over my shoulder now  it was pretty funny  i'm walking down  i flew in  i'm in rhode island now  i took a red eye  and i flew in  and i'm walking down the street in manhattan today  and the guy's like  this guy's like  hey you were so funny on tv last night  i'm like dude i was on a plane last night  i don't know what you're smoking  he's like  you're on conan 
[02:27:00]  you gonna be a prick  don't be a dick  don't be a dick  oh and then i had a homeless guy ask me for money today right  yeah  i told him i have any change  and he goes  oh mr nfl ain't got no change  let me just say  you're homeless but you get fox sports  he knows you from fox sports  jay  maybe he downloads it on the internet  what's up  speaking of the homeless  uh guess what we're doing tuesday  next tuesday  please tell me it's true  homeless shopping spree too  next tuesday  is it gonna be the same place  undisclosed location 
[02:27:30]  undisclosed location  that's right  yep  we are bringing the homeless uh christmas shopping once again this year  oh you got you know what  you guys have so much love in your hearts  see  we skipped last year  and uh we did this two years ago  and you were in the studio for the whole thing remember  that was a melee  a lot of  i like  what was the guy's name  ziggy was trying on victoria's secret  ziggy was trying on really nice suits  if you remember  urine smelling ziggy  trying on some nice versace suits  with the crap  and  crap in his underwear 
[02:28:00]  god knows what he had  he smelled awful  yeah you think  i call him larry zonka  that guy  because he's always down by the boston comedy club  cradling his 40 ounce  like he's going over the goal line  what's new you guys  i listen to you in cleveland  you guys are  you're global  isn't it great  it is great  we had two cities today my friend  what two  uh somewhere in louisiana  wow  we're in new island  new islands  stop having sex with your brother  i'm listening to the radio  everyone is saying that 
[02:28:30]  i'm saying it wrong  so that's why i'm saying  somewhere in louisiana  we were saying new orleans  new orleans  new orleans  it's actually new orleans  now  now  and austin texas  hey music capital of the world baby  austin texas  we're on a station called the juice  the juice  did you say the jews  the juice  so benstein  hey did you guys see the corner back  corner from um  the seahawks  sean springs got busted for steroids  did he really  yeah he suspended for the year  he's a corner 
[02:29:00]  maybe football's not your sport  if you freaking max out the scales  at 180 after taking them  what did he weigh 110 pounds  when he came in the league  he busts up  yeah  let the fat tackles take the steroids  and you just work on covering receivers  you hump  yeah  kevin from jersey a little upset  saying jeter ruined the show  no keeter was great  when he's beating little kids  over the head with a bat  that was funny  weekend update  no actually you suck  yeah when he went against  the socks fan there  that guy  who was that guy 
[02:29:30]  that played the socks fan  he was on a couple of times so far  i think he's like a semi-regular now  oh it's kind of like me  kind of a boston guy  yeah  he's kind of like you  he gets to wave at the end of the show  yeah except i never got on the update desk  you never did  yeah you did  i know  i think you did once  i just saw  your vision is history anthony  i never got on ever  you were doing the ones  where you were playing the sports clips  in reverse  and it was  you know why that got on the air  why  check this out  rob schneider did it twice  and it got cut right before air  yeah  and he goes  ah  i'll give it to jay moore 
[02:30:00]  and it'll probably get on  oh really  it was really funny  and then he goes  well put a 10 on that circus  it's like you know  when they play the sports bloopers  or amazing sports moments  jay was playing sports clips  backwards  in reverse  isn't that amazing  did you see him jump up  backwards off of that thing  very funny  the ball sticks to the rim  whoa  what'd you do scotty  put crazy glue on the ball  hey jay what's your take on  the game tonight  islanders flyers 
[02:30:30]  hey man  islanders all the way  thank you  islanders  because they got rid of that  gay gortonman's fisherman  on their uniform  and went back to the  go to the  remember when they changed it  we've had gorton's  a gloucester fisherman  all right  we've had some problems  in the last few years  when i want fish sticks  i go to the new york islanders  they make the best fish sticks ever  hey  eric windrose  i don't understand  this whole thing about hockey  half the guys in hockey  their agents  are their freaking brothers  uh yeah  so he's like 
[02:31:00]  well the team owners  are talking to his  uncle cleotis  like what would happen  to a lawyer  you got some like  drunk uncle going  eric is the greatest  player to ever  live in the game  it really wasn't that funny  but i'll get it on the next one  you guys  don't worry  now it's mine  come on  sean springs was good  that was a nice little  hey i went on  uh  mike and the mad dog  last friday with boomer  oh  mike and the mad dog  and uh  like a five minute thing  because boomer's on nfl this morning  and you don't think we got a hundred emails 
[02:31:30]  oh i don't know if you did  i just wanted to tell you  from my mouth  jay's all over  jay went on  mike and the mad dog  all i did was imitate chris  the whole time i was on  you're not out of it  until you lose four games  and the best of it is  let's get back to the phones  bruce or bayside  bruce how are you  well you got guys like  my half of that  true true  no doubt about it  these guys can throw football  but let's see how they do  when mike holmgren is starting  to get tight  back up to the flesh 
[02:32:00]  let's get to have a commercial  wait for the commercial  welcome back  we'll be back up to this  we'll be back up to this  hey you coming in here or what  yeah i'm doing a host for tomorrow  so i can get in there tomorrow  and uh... i'm going to do rascal  actually this just happened  i'm going to do rascals friday  two shows friday  so we'll get in and have some fun  so i'll actually be in town a day longer  to fool around  i'm not calling for the shameless plug  i'm actually calling to  because i haven't called you guys in a long time  oh that's cool  but uh... 
[02:32:30]  i listened when uh...  vanilla ice was on the phone  when i was in uh...  vegas  ah yeah  man  that  stuff never happened  when i was in there  i can't complain with any of the things  that have happened to me  while in that studio  i got a sweet name after me  i had cousins making out  as they stripped for me  jay that was probably  the sickest display  we've ever had  in this studio  it was how many of the girls  were there  i don't know  like six  little league mom  it was that time of the month  little league mom  just shows up  rips her clothes off 
[02:33:00]  and jumps in this pile of vag  she must have been hungry  because no one was taking care of her  no no one was taking care of her  she just had the fever  she is somebody tried to take care of her  and there was whispering going on  and she pushed the head away  and then gave a little whisper  gave that little code like  you know what's funny  when i was in vegas  i'm driving around this guy  he's about 60 years old  he books the date  and now he's taking me  to all the radio stations  i go if you listen to these guys  you'll be addicted to them  trust me  they're new in vegas  and he's listening  and he's listening  and i go  you know all  i've been in the studio  all of this right now  is real  and the guy 
[02:33:30]  slows the car down  and looks at me  and goes  are you effing serious  yeah  like a weed  are you fake five chicks  in a gangbang  dude i was in vegas  you were at the paris  you were at the paris  you were at the paris right  hey jam what's up  hey buddy  i was there too  i didn't get to hear it though  but i saw photos  it was disgusting  yeah it was just  if norton thinks it's disgusting  there's probably people  with severed limbs  jay we had a video made  jay we had a video made  in a good way  it was that good  steve made a video  a 40 minute video  of all the highlights  you know what  i love the fact that  uh 
[02:34:00]  little league mom  got in the action  and like you said  she was having her time  and it was so subtle  how she informed the girl  that uh  it was her time  it was just a little pat on the head  and a little look  and the girl knew what was going on  meanwhile it takes me  to have a mouth looking like  ronald mcdonald  before i even realized  that maybe i shouldn't be  in that area  at that moment  and he was like a drunk clown  from quick change  yeah  and they just have a look  and they know 
[02:34:30]  like  can it  here comes clara battle  that's so funny  hey you guys  lynch is playing tomorrow night too  isn't he  where  where's he at  for wednesday  where  i don't know  billy hughes told me  la machine told me  he was playing  lynch is not good with the plug  i don't know  i mean he's too shy  to plug or something  yeah  we never know when he's playing  well  hey you know what  it's  he's been on heroin  maybe someone will call up  jay earl's in the hospital  what's wrong with him  he uh  he  he almost bled  he had like a  bleeding ulcer 
[02:35:00]  he lost a lot of blood  he's in there  oh you know what  that makes me feel bad  because i probably contributed  to a pint of it  you  we're just looking like  we might as well  have just injected him  with something  that put him in the hospital  we know damn well  we put him through  such hell  you know  i'll bet you  i'll bet you a thousand dollars  everyone in the room  can match it if they want  that he's not listening  yeah  because his monitor  would be like  beep beep beep beep  oh he don't want to listen  no way  they gave him a black pajama  in the hospital  well he has to  yeah i know 
[02:35:30]  because he's black earl  because he loves wearing  all black  and i don't think  he freaks out  he wakes up  get this off me  the black gown  with his black ass  sticking out the back  oh  i don't think that  you have to ruin it  you know  we need the paparazzi  to go down there  we need a picture of earl  in the white gown  i'll put up some reward money  if you could get us  a picture of earl  in the white gown  i'll give you a hundred dollars  i'll match it  no problem  two hundred dollars  we're up to two hundred  and we'll give a hundred  i don't even have to ask him  jim will give a hundred  i certainly won't  jim will give  four hundred dollars 
[02:36:00]  you get a picture of earl  in the white hospital gown  earl's gonna take a picture  of himself  and bring it in  who cares  earl has never worn anything  besides black  nope  and you don't have to see  his ass or anything  just him in the gown  holding his ivy  he said it was a bleeding  ulcer  it's probably full-blown AIDS  poor earl  what does earl look like  when he lost  how many pints of blood  was it  he said he lost  almost  almost a third  a third of his blood 
[02:36:30]  i'm thinking it almost looks like  a mrs butterworth's container  half full  the squeezy bottle  yeah he gets a little ashy  up top  yeah he gets ashy  you lose a lot of blood  he probably  probably looks like  qaddafi  hey brewers checking in too  here  all our buddies  shut up  jimmy  what are you talking about  niggers  hey wait a minute  this is america  for crying out loud  i can't even go in my car  and have a hoot and a holler  and now i gotta hear about  niggers

[02:39:30]  gay  so uh  derek jeter walks in  it's a massage uh  set up  a massage table  and uh chris katan  is the masseuse  jeter lays down on the table  i guess he couldn't  show his ass or something  so he's covered up  uh with a robe  uh and then uh chris katan  puts on some music  and starts massaging jeter  and he gets a little uh  personal  where he's he's putting  his hands down by his chest  and uh wrapping his arms  around him  and and singing  which by the way  he was enjoying  if you were really  watching the sketch 
[02:40:00]  you should have watched  chris's bulge  if he was really getting excited  that's what i'm talking about  oh my god  this is really happening  go ahead  i'm touching jeter  oh my god  oh the player  gay guys  god  so uh  jeter  jeter gets all pissed off  jumps off the table  and this happens  a couple of times  how he says  uh hey  you know  i'm feeling a little weird  about this  and uh  chris katan talks him  into laying back down
