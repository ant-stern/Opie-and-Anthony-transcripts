<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast begins with the hosts declaring their commitment to provocative, uncensored radio. They recount a recent mini-vacation, detailing their elaborate strategies for taking time off, including fabricating a Muslim holiday.  A detailed description of their experience at a UFC fight in Las Vegas follows, focusing on the brutality of the fights and the intense reactions of the crowd.  A listener, Jimmy, calls in, describing his VIP experience, sitting near celebrities like Mandy Moore and David Spade. He gives a blow-by-blow account of the Rampage Jackson vs. Forrest Griffin fight, highlighting the violence and the copious amounts of blood,  while also sharing humorous anecdotes about his and his friend Bob Kelly's feelings of inadequacy in the presence of exceptionally fit fighters. The hosts discuss the UFC's rising popularity and its impact on boxing.  Numerous photos from the event are mentioned and promised for online posting.  The segment also includes a prank call, a review of *Hancock*, and more listener calls. Anthony shares a humorous story about his and his girlfriend Jill's deceptive announcement at a family gatheringâ€”pretending to save money on car insurance with Geico instead of revealing their engagement.  The discussion returns to the UFC event and the hosts' experiences, punctuated throughout by offensive language and crude humor.

Bob Kelly joins the show as a guest.  The conversation starts with a funny anecdote about Kelly's attempt to subtly mention his work on HBO's "Torgasm" to Rampage Jackson.  This segues into a discussion about Rich Voss's awkward encounter with Ann Coulter at the Comedy Cellar. The hosts and Kelly share their own anxieties about meeting celebrities.  The show then features the recurring "FU" message segment, filled with angry and vulgar voicemails.  They discuss their upcoming "Virus Tour," mentioning confirmed comedians and hinting at surprise guests.  A significant portion focuses on the alleged Alex Rodriguez-Madonna affair, with the hosts offering crude and offensive critiques of both A-Rod and his wife's appearances.  The conversation shifts to *Extreme Home Makeover*, with the hosts and Kelly discussing their emotional responses to the show, particularly episodes featuring military veterans or families with disabilities. They analyze the show's emotional manipulation and question the choices of homes and neighborhoods featured, often using derogatory language to describe the families and their surroundings.  More listener calls, further commentary on *Extreme Home Makeover*, and continued speculation about the A-Rod situation, including Madonna's denial, follow. The segment ends with more listener calls, a discussion of the "black national anthem," and promotion of the upcoming tour and merchandise.  Profanity and offensive language are prevalent throughout.

The show continues with the hosts reminiscing about past antics.  They then discuss a Denver event where a jazz singer performed "Lift Every Voice and Sing" to the tune of "The Star-Spangled Banner," sparking a debate about the audience's reaction and the appropriateness of the situation. This is followed by a story about a Red Sox fan in Falmouth, Massachusetts, allegedly beaten with a baseball bat after being mistaken for a Yankees fan. The hosts discuss the intensity of the Red Sox/Yankees rivalry. Anthony then recounts a detailed, graphic account of being assaulted by his girlfriend's ex-boyfriend, "Louie," involving high beams, a baseball bat, and facial injuries.  Quick-hit segments follow: plugs for a UFC charity book and Bob Kelly's comedy shows; graphic descriptions of the running of the bulls in Spain and various animal attack videos from YouTube; detailed commentary on Pat from Munaki's participation in the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, including descriptions of his eating techniques and post-contest bowel movements; and speculation on the cause of plane nose damage.  The segment concludes with more discussion of Pat from Munaki's personal life and wrestling past, including audio clips from a news story about his hot dog eating contest training.

A segment heavily focusing on Pat, a guest with significant weight issues, ensues.  The hosts and other guests repeatedly make crude jokes about his body, particularly his buttocks and legs.  A large stain on the studio window, allegedly vomit, is intensely scrutinized and described with offensive language. The discussion is filled with sexually explicit and offensive jokes about bodily functions and anatomy.  Speculation about Pat's weight loss methods and financial situation is interspersed with more offensive jokes and descriptions of his body. The show briefly shifts to Robert Kelly's upcoming stand-up show, pornography, and other off-color jokes.  Pat unsuccessfully attempts a line-of-the-day sponsorship, still incorporating the focus on his physical attributes.

The final segment features a host rambling through various news items and a Playboy magazine. He shares his opinions on John McCain, movies like *Wanted* and *Get Smart*, and the reality show *Rehab*.  He mentions Alex Rodriguez, Barack Obama's election, and his own financial problems. A significant portion focuses on the Elliot Spitzer scandal, with the host reading and commenting on a news article in a disjointed manner, interspersed with non sequiturs and inappropriate jokes.  He reads a career advice column, criticizing the advice and the advice-seeker.  A caller criticizes the host's crude jokes about Elliot Spitzer. The host also mentions viewing pictures in a magazine he doesn't specify, which he cannot share due to the audio-only format.  Vulgar language and inappropriate comments are prevalent throughout.

[00:04:30]  they stayed on top of me to make sure that i had all my credentials i had everything i mean i had full  access to everything to the fighters to the what you want to by the way you want to have low self-esteem  bring your girl to a ufc weigh-in oh really me and bob sat there we sat there like two fat chicks  like watching the weigh-in's exciting because they bring these guys up and then you know they  weigh them it's like there's a couple thousand people watching this and it's just all guys who 
[00:05:00]  are in better shape than anybody you've ever seen in your life and me and him are just sitting there  moping and i'm thinking i just hate sour cream and onion potato chips and i'm watching a guy you  know like that little v that real men get they have it starting at the chin  but god damn it was exciting man um the day before even just going to the i'm sorry i forgot  you're actually here i'm just i apologize dude i'm already yapping go ahead you know my self-esteem  is so low i only take my chick to sumo wrestling matches that's the best way to do it look at this 
[00:05:30]  guy he's load of crap look at this guy he can't control his calorie intake did you uh did you see it  sir uh yeah i did see it i saw you um i saw you right behind mandy moore well that's what we're  getting at jimmy uh went out to vegas was treated like a king the fights were great rampage jackson  lost huh i was i was uh i really wanted to talk about um jimmy's perspective about the whole fight  because the whole fight they were cheering for forrest griffin because he's a crowd favorite i was not 
[00:06:00]  cheering for farce hold on but i wasn't cheering for farce i really wanted rampage um we saw  him that morning um we talked to him it's amazing this guy was fighting for a championship fight  that night and we saw him in the early afternoon having breakfast and uh we talked to him for a  little while and he's the same guy that he is when he comes in here he's just we love rampage jackson  yeah he was great gives us great radio but joel anything else because i want to go to jimmy and  get some highlights from his trip to vegas i just wanted to get that point that uh i was hearing on tv 
[00:06:30]  that they were like i saw the fight they were cheering for forrest and the third and the second round which  was amazing for forrest um but at the end they started booing him now they what's up with that  they didn't boo forrest dude what they booed they really are those fans are so hardcore they're romans  it's like going to it's like being in rome we we watched every fight and uh some of the like the  earlier card fights because they're like young guys trying to make a name from this and you're  watching a street fight spaniard spaniard spaniard thumbs down off with his head yeah but every 
[00:07:00]  all right buddy uh they boo if there's not enough action because they're so used to these guys these  guys aren't like boxers that are going to clinch up man they literally are are if they're not  punching each other in the face somebody is spin kicking somebody is putting somebody on the ground  trying to break his arm it was it was like watching a coliseum fight um so that's probably  why they were booing if there was a momentary pause in the action uh they booed yeah they want 
[00:07:30]  him to keep going and and beat the crap out of each other yeah they really want to see and i didn't know  bobby was such a ufc expert like he knew everything really it was annoying well look at that is annoying  look at the picture of bobby behind manny moore he's studying the fight everyone thinks that we were  i was cranky in that phone manny moore this is how good the ufc took care of us this was the seating  thing you have the octagon you have uh the announcers of course sitting there then you have the front  row with like rampage's family and chuck liddell and uh and all the the fighters ufc guys behind them 
[00:08:00]  was uh was mandy moore and then uh over to her left was david spade and ketis from the chili peppers  and then boy did the boy did the celeb list drop off  in the row behind them was robert kelly jim norton  somebody some guy from a band who was actually really cool who i who remembered me from river  if he was up there with bc i didn't i didn't know what band he was in and that's why this picture  is all over these sites now mandy moore cheering she's cheering and my jimmy and bob kelly behind 
[00:08:30]  mandy moore we're gonna put these pictures up on onaradio.com my favorite thing about those  pictures is the girl next to mandy moore has her arms up and it looks like jimmy's arms so it looks  like you have no you're not cheering you're just straight faced and your hands are just up a little  bit in clenched little fists going like oh i'm here oh do you know who was sitting one one or two  seats over from her who was so i was so sexually attracted to that chick i don't laura wish i could 
[00:09:00]  have thought of a guy real quick okay damn it you know vacation takes its toll that's from the girl  from that 70s show um oh the one with the red hair or the dark one now uh but her yeah laura pre-pond  yeah oh that's why we call him stunt brain jimmy yep like that juicy yeah oh juicy i mean her breasts  her like her her hips she is such a she's not heavy you know she's perfectly built yeah um she is  fantastic wow really sexy and uh well now we need to see pictures of her come on i guess this is the 
[00:09:30]  place to uh this is the place to be if you're a celebrity go to these uh ufc events now huh well  the young chicks i think like a lot of the uh a lot of these guys because they're like they're like  the most alpha male yeah but they're all nice dudes it's amazing there's something like with boxers  where i guess because boxing is such an institution but none of these guys are dicks none of these  fighters like liddell because they're not making you know huge money yet they're not that's why but  you know they're not spoiled man i'm just joking i mean they well they've been bitching that they 
[00:10:00]  would need to make a little more money than they're making but uh so far so good with this whole ufc  they know what they're doing and they probably should make more money because they are uh they're  like they're they're like rock stars man liddell was actually running out to where the crowd i saw  sully there was chris angel um i didn't talk to him because their seats weren't quite as good as ours  oh they put you know the small players like chris and sully can go sit you know with the regular  people so you're saying sully from godsmack didn't uh have as good of a seat as you why would he  you know um but liddell liddell is like running out just like taking pictures with fans i mean these guys 
[00:10:30]  like never say no to fans it was really cool to watch man like the difference between them  and other people who have uh achieved a certain level of fame it was dicks they've become yeah  as it gains popularity i'm sure they'll uh turn into uh douches maybe like every other athlete but  they were dude rogan rogan we hung with all weekend i was just really you know i got a picture  with wow because randy couture was there doing uh he was behind on somebody's corner remember the guy 
[00:11:00]  that knocked out mirko krokop with that kick to the face he's also the same guy that broke randy's  arm with a kick in a fight he broke his arm with a kick what's his name do you remember oh yeah  gabriel gonzaga okay and uh i really wanted to see him fight but unfortunately it was about a 40 seconds  that savage oh he was fighting too he wasn't even on the main card dude this monster rogan said that  when he walks on stage for the weigh-in it's like a stone figure it's like a mythic he's like a 250  pound brazilian eating and killing machine and he just uh it was it was amazing because you're so 
[00:11:30]  close you could hear when they oh yeah yeah and in that forest fight man i wanted rampage so badly  there was a forest is a great fighter he threw a kick in the second round to rampage's leg he  buckled his leg and you could hear it was like oh he threw a kick and uh and rampage was visibly  staggered and spent the entire round on his back holding on to the guy basically trying to stop the  guy from from from tapping him out how the hell do they survive a shot like that it's amazing to 
[00:12:00]  me and how does it look uh being so close to the fight is it just horrifying at times you you feel  like somebody has invited you again it's like watching a caged street front because on tv you  could almost be all right i'm a i'm away from the action story this is pretty cool but i'm in my  living room but to be like 15 20 feet away it's got to be insane i honest to god dude i was such i was  so excited watching this like i didn't like i've been to a lot of sporting events all it's been  years and i've had cool moments but i i was afraid the girl in front of me i jumped up so many times 
[00:12:30]  because rampage was was was sluggish like compared to the way i've seen him before and then like in  the third round he really started hitting forest and every time he would throw up like a combo i was  jumping up and making like like that noise it's amazing how you don't care how awful you look when  you're cheering i was scrunching my fist and i was honestly being aware that i was gonna punch the  girl in front of me in the head because i kept jumping up with my fist and shaking that would  rule i was so worried that i was accidentally gonna hit her in the back of her skull cheering for him 
[00:13:00]  it was it's amazing how invested you get that's awesome but when you watch a champion walk out like  i've never been to a championship fight before it's this energy like you just want you want to scream  like you don't you can't the the power of feeling one of these guys walk into this arena to fight  with music play it's it's an amazing you only imagine what it would have been like to sit in  the real coliseum though and watch people hack each other to pieces with swords you would just be 
[00:13:30]  yeah it couldn't be much different it couldn't be much different yeah it couldn't be with the  exception of i i didn't feel quite as bad i was sad watching rampage lose i really was because i like  him and i thought i thought that he should have kept the belt but his head didn't come off he didn't  die and he was funny in the he got more fans because he was so graceful at his loss honest  to god because they like to boo rampage because he oh my good god because they uh because he beat  liddell everybody loves chuck liddell rampage came over from pride and knocked him out people don't 
[00:14:00]  like rampage jackson so they were booing him they're booing the champion and then when he lost and  he's up there and he's giving his uh because rogan goes right in and talks to you in the ring  and uh he was just like ah got my ass whooped and it's like who can't like this guy yeah i think  we got the audio that we're gonna play in a little while oh yeah wait till bobby comes in because  bobby i'm probably not doing this justice but uh bobby's just an animal when it comes to the ufc  he really he really is like an expert on these fighters i just we say it every time these guys  are in and every time we talk about the ufc i just don't know what boxing is gonna do man 
[00:14:30]  how do you go no one's interested when was the last boxing match honestly that anyone was really  interested in how do you go to a boxing event after going to a ufc event who's got who's uh  it's all ordered a pay-per-view for boxing who's watched boxing it's it's this thing is now huge  boxing's old school for like our parents yeah they're the last generation that's going to really  enjoy boxing because this ufc is just destroying it's gained acceptance uh it's not as as savage as  it used to be right when they had no rules uh it was some people found it just too hard to watch 
[00:15:00]  there was boxing's gonna be personality driven now like if you're not a personality who people  want to watch yeah people up you have no shot in boxing because it's not as interesting to watch  yeah there's this almost this uh you almost have to give vince mcmahon a little nod too because these  fighters come out to music you know and people are all psyched about them they're they have  personality uh there's car you know they're they're charismatic uh it's different than boxing 
[00:15:30]  where it's like all right here's this guy comes out with his entourage and you know it's it's a lot  different i think you got to give a nod to vince uh for showing people how how some of these uh stars  uh should come out there's if there's got to be it see if you can find screen caps here rocket i don't  know if there are any but there was one fight like you don't have to like like know the fighters to like  watch because the first fight we were watching it was like this tall skinny dude was was kind of  beating up on this other guy and uh it looked like a lot of poor kids getting his ass kicked in  the middle of the third round somewhere he just grabs the black guy the certain the tall black 
[00:16:00]  dude and he just he chokes him out it's like that's how fast wow those fights you're getting  your ass kicked and all of a sudden your arms were up in the air because the other guy had to tap  because you almost snapped his arm in half the bloodiest uh fight i've ever seen happened uh this  guy josh i think his last name is koschek he's a he dies here blotted and a lot of people don't like  him because he's like a crap talker and uh he was on the the reality show and he fought  this dude uh chris liddell liddell i think his name is pronounced and he he opened him up on a cut  he it was such a bloody match and they said head wounds bleed more they look a lot worse than they 
[00:16:30]  really are medically look at that when oh god it looked like he had been shot and he uh look at  look at how he's smeared blood all over the it's everywhere the mat was smeared look at that picture  up too josh uh koschek's blonde hair was dyed like the like it looked like he had a red halo on  look at his hair and where was he bleeding from jimmy i know the head but what part looks like  everywhere i couldn't i couldn't tell it looked like it looked like dealy plaza 
[00:17:00]  you get any blood on you jimmy it literally i'm surprised we didn't get splattered there was so much  uh blood on the mat i couldn't believe how bloody the mat got from this guy but he kept getting up  and uh what a warrior man this guy just he lost on a decision uh but he man he just wouldn't stop  fighting these guys are tough dudes if they they gotta add a little more blood to the ufc a little  more blood look at that take a page from vince mcmahon and you know hide the razor blades and stuff  every once in a while a fighter has to go in and take one for the team and get really bloody for 
[00:17:30]  everybody you can't not but the beautiful thing about these fights is they're all i mean the beautiful  thing i wanted the rampage fight to go longer uh but they give them five five minute rounds so it's  like a 25 minute fight these guys get three three minute rounds and the winner our bud dwyer  dude it was it was uncomfortable how much blood there was but it was again the guy was fine it  was it was a head wound which is just yeah when you get cut your head bleeds like you've been shot  but you're actually fairly okay right so so jimmy uh you go to what would tyler durden do and there's 
[00:18:00]  a picture of mandy moore and then behind her is you and bob kelly is anyone recognizing that you two  were big stars too behind mandy moore i um well there was a lot of opium they have no idea but  i mean you guys have done very very well with your careers and no one is mentioning that that's  little jimmy norton behind mandy moore yeah there was uh on the website they actually uh said it looks  like there's a new celebrity couple then they kind of mocked the fact that no one thinks that we're  dating of course which i thought was did we well bobby is directly behind her he's directly behind her 
[00:18:30]  did he smell her hair or anything um i don't know that'd have been creepy and leaned forward  bobby smelt her hair oh you could have bobby is such a super fan no i mean in her lap  bobby's such a super fan you can tell by how he's looking that he's like i could do that  i think i think i want to do this oh god i thought he did king kong bundy  but obby pointed out that i look i actually do look relatively thin and handsome in these pictures 
[00:19:00]  but um but he pointed out that i look like i'm in a bad mood but it might have been that  because they showed mandy moore on fox uh or on i'm sorry on the on the jumbotron  during the intros like right before the intro right so i might have been very tense before um  because i found myself very nervous i have to correct myself mandy this is what they say about  the picture on uh w w t dd.com mandy moore was seated within inches of stand-up comedy superstar  jimmy norton at the one page jackson forrest griffin fight cool they wrote that yeah they 
[00:19:30]  must be fancy it's funny i mean that's very cool i didn't i didn't think they gave you the the nod  i i didn't notice it either till eroc uh blew it up a little bit and they said people thought  we were kind of dating oh that's cute no one did and then they correct themselves actually no one  yeah can i just see how uh rampage uh leading many to wonder if the two are now dating  no not really no one is wondering that that's what they say that's what it says yeah it says 
[00:20:00]  norton wasn't there to get mandy's trap he was there to hunt and dispose of a human target he  cannot be reasoned with he cannot be bargain with kill kill kill because i have a look on my face  god they must be fans over at that website yeah they said about the terminator that's pretty  reason yeah i do look like a horse's ass just but i was i was just probably very nervous it's  amazing like i was really bummed out i was rampage handled it though man he didn't uh i can't believe  how graceful the guy was in defeat he didn't bitch he didn't complain he's like well i thought i uh 
[00:20:30]  i thought i should have won but uh he wasn't this i don't know there's just like a real a real  grace in the way he lost cool we're heading for our first break here uh blood went on camera during  the chris uh uh lidl fight wow also uh john from jersey wants everyone to know that randy won that  fight even though he had the broken arm randy oh yeah you know he did win that fight that's right  that was one of gonzaga's wow uh what else uh and then we got this uncle uncle dick from port  washington uncle dick what's up happy port guys all right hey what i want to know jimmy was did they

[00:23:00]  awful yeah danny why is uh hancock god awful danny review it's kind of like someone had a great idea  for a movie and shot it as like a as like a twilight zone episode and then said oh you know what we don't  have enough for a 90 minute film so let's just add all this garbage to it to try and fill it with  something are you describing this show i could be i saw i saw a clip where he's like flying around  like superman but he's got like a bottle of jack daniels or something in his hand i'm like what is 
[00:23:30]  what are they doing that's the part that was actually kind of cool because it goes from this  you know it it takes a different turn than the usual superhero movie where the public loves him and  it's just like oh hancock save us where they they hate him because he's just he's just causing  trouble and damaging things while he is you know saving lives and fighting crime sort of at the  same time he's causing millions of dollars so they hate him they hate his guts they want him out of  out of la and it's a cool premise and then until about 40 minutes in when obviously the screenwriter 
[00:24:00]  said we got nothing else here and then they had to introduce this whole big you know quote unquote  twist thing to try and and take it somewhere else the twist is is what his chicks a superhero too  what do you want me to ruin it for people i don't i don't mind it yeah he's just like you want me to  i don't care jimmy why are you covering your ears you're not going to see this dumb movie who knows i  may have to say wally or wally or however the hell you say wally i think wally i don't know i'm just  guessing wally the pixar movie is getting uh great reviews look at look at him flying with a bottle 
[00:24:30]  what is what what is he doing he's drinking and flying yeah now oh he just wrecked a sign of course  he crashes into a sign and gets into a car of uh gangster with some homies with some homies that  now have to turn around and shoot him and of course the bullets bounce off him because he's  a superhero and now he stops the car with his feet like fred flintstone actually like i like the fact  the gangbangers shot at him too uh blue healer kentucky hancock is a great half movie so walk out  halfway through oh we were discussing that over the weekend uh movies that we've walked out of 
[00:25:00]  and uh the life aquatic yeah was that what that crap was called uh steve steve zizu a life aquatic  yeah yes you uh you walked out on that one i walked out on that one that's and i rarely walk out of  uh movies and it's a wes anderson flick i understand you're supposed to like like everything wes anderson  does yeah i hated that movie yeah i i watched it uh i didn't walk out on it because i saw it at home  which would have been silly and you can't just walk out yeah you can shut off the tv but to walk 
[00:25:30]  out of your own house is silly you're wandering around the neighborhood going i just walked out  of my house because the movie was bad and then you go back and you feel stupid how funny would that be  though you walk out of your own house because the dvd sucks just walked out on a movie no because  the black people won't stop talking who are you why are you in my home  i walked out on um uh oh many many years ago a little movie called mr mike's mondo video yeah it 
[00:26:00]  was uh yeah the guy from saturday night live sure that's now dead oh is he really yeah he's dead now  what was his last name there uh stump brain mike mike mike mike corleone  oh my goodness yes his brain did explode yeah you ever walk out of a movie jimmy are you dying  over there what's up i swallowed and it went down the wrong path michael donahue  right excuse me michael o'donahue thank you brother man you do notice that jimmy's pretty much choking 
[00:26:30]  to death over here yeah well i i had to get the information out you're right there jimmy i am yeah  i i don't know i've ever walked out of a movie i'm trying i think i have at one point i just  can't remember what it was oh my dad and i walked out of my dad when i was a kid i wanted to go see  my bodyguard because it was really exciting oh god my dad didn't feel like driving that far so he  took me to see stardust memories it's a black and white woody allen film which at this age i might 
[00:27:00]  enjoy it but at that age i was not one of the better woody allen movies right not at all there's a  million woody allen movies i'd see before that one oh that one stunk yeah and uh i was so annoyed we  left halfway through it and my dad took me to see my bodyguard like in the middle we caught most of  it what was the movie with kim basinger basinger or whatever and uh cartoons cool world i walked  out of that one too and i loved kim basinger back back then too uh but she wasn't good enough to  just sit through the movie to just stare no her animated uh body well it went from she was playing 
[00:27:30]  like with cartoon characters and stuff yeah there was uh uh i was supposed to go see alien when it  first came out with my mommy she was going to take me to the movies and see alien and i was very  psyched because i had heard about it and you know great movie still holds up i love watching it and um  it was sold out so we had to go down the street and see the cinematic movie release of battle star 
[00:28:00]  galactica which was just the show on tv at the time but they they decided they were going to put  it in the movies the pilot episode in the movies and i sat there watching that bummed out because i  didn't see alien oh i was so no i was just annoyed steven s from bashar i goose stepped out of schindler's  list not enough laughs you hear about hitler getting his head knocked off yeah what yeah some uh  some dude uh didn't like hitler too much so he went to that wax museum all right madame tussauds 
[00:28:30]  sure and just just knocked hitler's head off with one block off to rock him suck him hitler it was the  second guy into the exhibit the second guy he was a berlin cop he wait a minute hold on hold on i i know  you're you're going to give us the details but i have a problem with the fact that they didn't  kind of hide hitler's wax figure maybe deep into the into the museum he's the second one you see no  no the the person who took the head off is the second guy who was in the second guy to see hit 
[00:29:00]  the hitler figure oh okay ran all the way to the back where the exhibit was i would assume you would  hide hitler okay i'm all right thank god they had this thing set up where they were supposed to  do where hitler has a little thing and it goes kapow and then it says congratulations you're the  six millionth customer so thank god they ended that quickly oh my god he knocked his head off  yeah clear off headlock he had hitler in a headlock and the guards were coming and he 
[00:29:30]  twisted and just separated the head but that's wow that's not a fair fight no no hitler's not  moving too well these days so no how could he do that boo you beat up wax hitler wow gee wow very  brave and they actually the german the museum had put they have this really weird thing in  germany where they they of course they vilify hitler but almost to the point of like ridiculousness  where they don't acknowledge him as a historical figure which he was i mean yeah yeah no matter what  he's an animal yeah but they got mad at the movie downfall which was a great film and it portrayed 
[00:30:00]  hitler like they showed the personal side of him which uh you can't hide that he was a person i mean  the fact that he was a human being who had love and who had affection for his dog more frightening  than more frightening that he was able because we like to pretend that we have no connection to  these people who are such barbarians but yeah that is a guy who could have been somebody you knew yeah  you want him as some kind of monster that is completely unrelatable but uh yeah when you know 
[00:30:30]  he's got to put his little dog goldie down with that little poison pill he felt a little bad and that  said hitler and that brought a little tear to your eye right you know i was watching i just kind of  felt bad and that's not too outrageous by the way you walk around uh new york city and you realize  you know people love their dogs way more than than actual people so yeah something about blondie  excuse me everybody thank you steve how was your vacation there or or we're calling it the mini  vacation we're gonna take a real vacation vacation next month why not do we know when we got away with 
[00:31:00]  one man i don't know we got to figure it out my nose fixed let's gotta figure it out because i might  go to turks yeah yeah turks and cakes yeah turks and cakes sure is that the guy that did it that's  the guy that punched hitler looks like a skinhead looks like a nazi what happened looks like he would  be in agreement with hitler he wanted to take it home as a souvenir yeah what is he doing he kicked  hitler's head off and yelled no stick-to-itiveness yeah he's a scary looking guy looks like a soccer 
[00:31:30]  hooligan yeah so uh uh pool update ah well um we're still at the point where the pool uh company might  get a bad commercial from me but uh at least it's it's getting done it's full of water so it's officially  a pool okay um but uh just a couple little details here and there got to be taken care of  should be should be today and uh keith of course is over there um taking care of business as he does 
[00:32:00]  uh but i had a little little soiree over the house over the weekend a little soiree um it was uh me and  uh jill and our uh families both of our families we were going out to the nautical mile in freeport  and uh beforehand what is the nautical mile that is a strip uh in freeport of white trash long island  of white trash uh yes um a lot of fans down there what am i doing no it's believe me there are a lot 
[00:32:30]  of fans down there what's up freeport it was uh it was really cool though a lot a lot of fun yeah  a lot of parties going on down there man people just really knowing how to party it's almost like  a poor man's jersey shore which is really bad when you consider jersey shores like a poor man's jersey  shore it's really awful but uh had fun really did uh but beforehand we had a little a little soiree 
[00:33:00]  uh with the uh families and uh everyone was suspicious my sister calls me and goes what's  going on why are you and jill having you know both the families over your house first of all you never  have guests over your house and uh uh secondly why both families before you're going out you know to  the freeport you adjust to that you never have family over your house oh that's well true but i never  i've never really entertained right at the house you said guests but you're talking about your own 
[00:33:30]  family yeah you don't even invite to your house but the truth of the matter is i i'm uh i have the  the house is really getting in order now and i like having people over that's what it is okay  entertaining and jill's very good at that you know she's good at putting things together and making  sure to have the right food there and everything oh really yeah i'm terrible at it but she's really good  at entertaining like that so uh you know the families came over and we're eating little you  know hors d'oeuvres and stuff didn't want to eat too much because we were going out to dinner and 
[00:34:00]  everything uh had some wine and and beer for for everybody so after a few drinks um we kind of you  know got uh up uh next to each other in in the uh kitchen and clink the little glasses like clink clink  clink clink clink clink clink and said uh you know me and jill i said we've been together you know  a relatively short period of time how many days um we were kind of you know past the whole day's  thing we're on the month thing now you know months right approaching 60 it's almost 60 days just going 
[00:34:30]  on two months okay and uh said you know relatively short period of time but uh huge uh feelings for  each other and and um you know it's very unexpected that this would happen and then she said a few  words about the same thing and i said and and and with that all said and done we we have a very  special announcement to make at this point um uh jill's sister is crying uh sal is going i told you 
[00:35:00]  roe i told you i knew it i knew it uh my mother's face is just red uh both families are just drop jawed  they stop breathing yeah yeah everyone's still holding their glass up and um so i have a very  special announcement to make uh we saved a boatload of cash on our auto insurance with geico i used a  hacky geico commercial line and you could not see two more pissed off families in your life oh were 
[00:35:30]  they angry why would they be pissed off though because they were all excited they thought this  was just a whirlwind romance going into true love and and announcing a marriage or something and and  we just completely uh whose idea faced them it was kind of both of ours we were just hanging out  laughing because then my brother could called up and said you know you got to confirm or deny these 
[00:36:00]  rumors i'm hearing so we thought it was kind of funny rumors it was just i think my sister because  she's like you don't do this why are both families getting together why at your house you don't have  people over you're going out but you're going over the house first so the chatter started when the invite  went out that you know you're gonna have a little together at your house yeah a little chatter that's  hilarious i have a question on a scale from one to ten yeah what does your geico joe get  oh actually uh as far as dark comedy it got a 10 oh okay but but the uh no not from that from us 
[00:36:30]  from the family they were just drop-jawed and and really pissed they were annoyed what did sal  like i lost my bet i guess he had bet with a few people that this was going to be a big announcement  yeah day you know the big announcement day chuck chuck one from pleasant city ohio nice ant hack but 
[00:37:00]  nice yeah it was i understood it was like a hack kind of a thing to say uh using you know a line from  a geico commercial but it seemed like the appropriate hacky line i knew it was hacky but it was like  something that just would have that's the difference by the way if you're going hack as long as you know  it's hack before you go hack you're all right there i knew the line was hack but it was an appropriate  use of a hack line there are people that go hack thinking they're being lenny bruce right  that's the difference exactly you can go hack if you openly realize in your dumb head that you're 
[00:37:30]  doing that attention please uh jill and i walked into a bar we own it  be more funny  yeah that's hilarious well it got it got the uh yeah i got the families annoyed  um our mission did it wreck dinner oh yeah no i don't i don't want to i don't want to wreck  dinner a few more drinks and everyone was fine i don't want to blow up your spot but uh you know  that uh email you sent me can we uh can can we talk about that or what or is that just like oh jill's

[00:41:30]  but jimmy's saying there are ways to control the situation my friend no let me tell you something  there's no way to control that situation because at some point you're gonna have to uncork the  bottle right and uh if if the bottle let's say you take a wine bottle and you're uncorking it the  normal way by the way uh red wine right no no this is a white a fine white wine i'm talking a white  wine right wine but sometimes red pinot you don't care how about a little uh what's the one in between 
[00:42:00]  there you know it's a fine white wine let's just say sure and and you know how you normally uncork a  bottle uh uh it's standing straight up and you uncork it and there's no problem and you can pour  it into the glass let's say the bottle was laying on its uh uh side okay our bottle doesn't really  have a side so let's say it's the the back of the bottle and it's just laying down and and now  everything's done all the fun and festivities are over and you're pulling the cork out of the wine 
[00:42:30]  bottle it's gonna all pour out right yeah but there's ways of controlling that  with what give me nose sock  you don't want you don't want your wine all over your socks no you don't understand i've actually  because i've had a lot of wine bottles and it's a problem so i will as i remove the cork i'll just 
[00:43:00]  grab a sock and jam it right in the neck of that bottle no because you don't want wine on your sock  i'd rather have wine just go all over the sheets and then use the sheets and then you wash the sheets  and then you lay around in the wine who cares yeah who cares you'll walk off the sheets on your back  like a cape  hancock it's a new movie yeah steve g from whack bag wow nice ed way to go old clown mouth

[01:01:30]  was hanging out the whole night she was uh she did uh red eye with charade do you like or dislike  yeah i love her she's great i mean there's times where i didn't like things she said this  she said to me about the 9-11 which i didn't like but i do overall i like her very much and  she's great because she never apologized she's a bit outspoken at times she is but she never says  she's sorry and she never backs up i i respect that she what she says is just opinion and that's  allowed but she was so cool hanging out all night and uh we were all she was talking to everybody 
[01:02:00]  she's one of the nicest people does she know the show by the way uh i don't know she knew tough  crowds she knew me from tough crowd um but the uh her friend the guy she was with knows opiate  because he lives here in new york and she's heard of the show of course um well so we're all hanging  out and then voss walks in and uh because he loves ann coulter and loves to be considered like an  intellectual conservative oh and uh so he walks rich voss what did you say he wants to be considered  like a conservative and an intellectual voss just wants to be thought of as a smart guy say that 
[01:02:30]  that's what he thinks and he doesn't say he doesn't even know what conservative means  i want to be smart you just used voss and intellectual in the same yeah yeah but not in a good way as  antonyms okay how you lost me but antonyms are kind of like i know i'm kidding that's actually a  really good joke no i knew you knew i was just getting to it sorry i'm sorry that's it uh i was uh  so voss is there and voss walks in with the baby and ann is sitting there and uh we're all having a  ball and she looks at rich and she goes oh my god i know you you're funny and he recognized her and he

[01:03:30]  you've never seen a dummy take the wind out of 20 people's sails it was we were having a ball  until he walked in and sucked the fun out by him it was it was he just embarrassed himself what an  idiot and bonnie who you can't not love bonnie we're sitting there a minute later and she goes to  me if if he wasn't sure wouldn't you just wait a second before saying anything right why would you

[01:08:30]  michigan with us last summer hopefully get uh we'll get steven lynch for the the tour this uh this  summer well not the tour one one date august 2nd uh d-rod it's everywhere that's all  anyone that's all anyone is talking about is this uh a-rod guy and madonna and now uh what uh  they're both racing you got a-rod and his wife they're they're trying to like uh file the papers  first for doesn't matter who for a little divorce action files it first she is going to walk away 
[01:09:00]  a winner oh wow so supposedly there's a prenup though yeah supposedly there's a prenup again  she's gonna walk away a winner i doubt that covers infidelity you know yeah that's i think  that's what she's claiming he's been cheating on her at strip clubs for years and she know she's  known about it and now he's trying to find religion supposedly and she's flipping out about it i don't  get it uh kabbalah yeah yeah she he's he's been i mean he's been caught cheating at strip clubs with 
[01:09:30]  people and never said anything how do you know he's been actually caught cheating at strip clubs  bob dude don't you read the daily in the post it's a fact if it's in there is that with the  whole madonna tie-in is he was going to her for what spiritual guidance yeah i bet you he's not  banging her why would he well because she's an icon i mean she's a good looking i would she's 50  the girl yeah she's 50 come on 30 what uh he's 32 yeah he could get any material girl video girl 
[01:10:00]  anymore you guys are missing the point that's exactly material broad material dame  but no that's that's a material broad material bag a material cougar oh god she is a cougar  why would a rod go the cougar route because he can bang anything he wants she is an untouchable  she's an icon i mean madonna is an icon yeah but that's why i think it shows that a rod's damaged  that he has to like he'd bang an icon like that when he could have any broad out there i also think 
[01:10:30]  he likes the idea of being around someone who's much more famous and recognizable than he is  like they said he's starstruck around her and i think that's what he's probably hanging out with  her for he's probably just hanging out with her because she's madonna and he's going for this  religious thing but she's paying attention to him why she's madonna why would a guy want that  i would i would hang out with her i mean he couldn't not she's a man no yeah yeah she's got  like lance omstrong zero body fat she's all it's awful i think she's got that big i just had a kid  belly button just pushed out it looks like a little head inside there you guys are nuts that 
[01:11:00]  belly button makes me want to puke you wouldn't everything makes you want to puke you wouldn't  bang madonna no no no no i don't believe any of you i think if the chance came no i never thought  she was hot man i never did either never but because she's the truth or dare years with i was  baiting hanging around and it was black and white footage then maybe the black and white footage made  her a little hotter but yeah she's got veiny bicep muscles back in the old days when she was 
[01:11:30]  you know the madonna dressing like a little ragamuffin yeah that's the days you uh wanted  to bang madonna not now yeah she had a little meat on her bones she was nice yeah when she was a  little pudgy yeah she looks like a tranny trying to be her here it is  when you can start seeing ligaments on a woman ligaments yeah you don't want to see  ligaments you have hot ligaments but that's where that's the that's the cut off look at that acl 
[01:12:00]  i love your ligaments that's the cut off with me i mean it doesn't matter how old you are for the  most part but as soon as you can start seeing the ligaments yeah you know there's no meat on that  bone yeah i bet she's fun to make out with i think you guys are crazy and i'm not into older  living at all i think i'm a firm believer that they should be put down after a certain  put down set up the tent around them and i bet her tongue is cold so there you go what was that  from that's hot right there it's not though there's a million girls that dress like that 
[01:12:30]  or that are way hotter we're looking at a picture of a very young madonna yeah but let me tell you  something that's when there's equity in her fame back when it was that age yeah there was equity equity  in her fame here's the other thing thank you bob for pointing that out i felt like a douche when i  said we're talking about politics you ass here's the other thing she's home ownership she's too  italian hang loose she's too italian she does everything to try to you know knock the italian  down a little bit but she's too italian for me well she was a lot more italian back then she's got 
[01:13:00]  the really big bushy eyebrows that she has to tweeze like literally every hour to make sure they don't  grow back in or you know there's a lot of arm hair that has to be ripped off she's playing a  regular basis i'll bet she's had the electrolyte sure take off a little too italian and tried it  twice and too many ligaments are showing ligament a rod is a douche though everything about this guy  he just doesn't seem like he's a nice guy although i will say one thing about kabbalah that i think if 
[01:13:30]  it if i interpreted it right i like it is that what they got a guy that that scum agent of his scott  boros who's just to me he's the guy's a cancer of a human just a blight uh a typical douche vulture  no integrity agent and i heard that he he told a rod to go into free agency which kind of kind of  made yankee fans really hate him like you're being treated well here and then you got to go out and  get what 300 million yeah and uh go into arbitration and all that and then i heard he fired boros and 
[01:14:00]  he came back to the yankees like that's why he came back because that scummy filthy agent because  of kabbalah no but they i would i'm not i lost well he's yeah he's trying to find out what do you  like about kabbalah he's with the agent madonna's agent who's uh a big guy in kabbalah now so he he  went with him and he's like a spiritual advisor yeah something like that he's really big into kabbalah  so he went with him and he told him look just go back to the yankees stop this right and then he fired  his scott which i like if that if that's the influence that that group had on him where he kind of i 
[01:14:30]  don't know what kind of money he took but if they caused him to not keep negotiating and being greedy  uh you know i kind of like that the weird part is it's also madonna's manager gaio siri is madonna's  manager and lenny kravitz's manager where a rod's wife is staying in paris at kravitz's house so he's  tied up with all three of them yeah they're all friends though i mean like i don't think she's banging  lenny kravitz i mean why would lenny do it you know what and this cynthia rodriguez too she's a  she's just a dummy she's a dumb broad like the whole uh stripper thing from last year 
[01:15:00]  what does she do she turns around and gets pregnant and has another kid after that that  that sounds smart to me actually that's financial planning but yeah but she already had one by him  she didn't need another one the more the more the money you get more money if you have two kids  what do you do with your stock splits you make more money that's it but it was we're not in a rod's  life but it's pretty obvious to everyone that he looks like he's a bit of a player and what  does she do she turns around and gets pregnant again more uh child support uh people.com reporting 
[01:15:30]  my husband and i are not planning on getting a divorce i know alex uh rodriguez through guy uh  osery who manages both of us i brought my kids to a yankee game i'm not romantically involved in any  way with a rod i have nothing to do with the state of his marriage or what spiritual path he may choose  to study that's madonna speaking to people.com today i believe it for some reason i do too there's no  way he's just he's just looking for something else in life yeah he's trying to get out of it  and he's trying to find spirituality why the late night visits to her pad though for spiritual guys 
[01:16:00]  the whole building's talking saying oh my god he's been hanging out at this building for a while now  taking the service elevator to sneak around a bit maybe after games i mean maybe it comes in after  a game if the yankees are finished at 10 30 he might be there by 11 30 because uh maybe it's just  after a game like you know we would hang i would hang with bob late night yeah i actually my mother  kicked me out of the house i was a year into sobriety she kicked me up because i would come  home at like two in the morning but i was at a ihop talking you know about how great it is not to 
[01:16:30]  drink and drug for like three hours with a bunch of other aa people yeah did anyone uh we were off  the air because we took a little vacation but uh did you see what a rod did during our break no and  it seemed like such a pr stunt and i hate to go down this road because it's a cancer kid but i'm like  what is he doing the whole madonna thing hits right and all of a sudden there's a huge story in all  the papers that uh there was a sick kid with cancer that's a huge yankee fan and stuff and  a rod decided that he was going to drive the kid to yankee stadium which is a great yeah very nice 
[01:17:00]  thing to do obviously but the timing was weird no because it knocked uh the madonna story uh you  know a little back in the paper and it was all about a rod you know driving this sick cancer kid  to yankee stadium with his family like he picked him up brought him to yankee stadium brought him back  it's very nice but the timing was weird as far as you know great to just have like the severe case  of road rage while you're doing that yeah with a beer in your hand just cursing like the worst curses 
[01:17:30]  ever and racial evidence just throwing them out at everybody on the road all right keep that picture  up you know like when i drive going back going back to madonna you would go oh that's a man jimmy  no she has very muscular arms that's too muscular i don't mind a girl that works out a little bit  and gets a little tone to her body but look that is ridiculous yeah but i still have sex with her  though of course without a doubt man you know just because she's madonna yeah but hey she's not an  ugly woman he would have sex with her because she looks like a man you know she's not you know how 
[01:18:00]  many ligaments you would feel just having sex with her ligaments would probably creep me out  but that also means good muscle control i'll bet you she's a great lay oh she's probably really  open sexually yes oh yes yes yes yes yes yes i mean those are if you didn't know any better that's  that's the arms of a man that angle you're right that's not a good picture of her but it doesn't  matter i'd still i'd still kiss her tenderly and have good sex with her yeah i better teach me a  lesson i'm gonna put the special belt on and show me who is boss she is she's boss certain positions like 
[01:18:30]  the heinie heinie bone hurts you yes yeah a certain position where the girl's heinie bone will hurt  you yeah if a girl loses too much weight you feel that heinie bone god it's a bit on the pointy it's  like hitting your femoral arteries the spine the bottom of the spinal circulation on your femoral  arteries feels like she has a tail  gonna bend your legs to give more of a seat 
[01:19:00]  uh well so that story's everywhere madonna's denying that they uh they're romantically involved  so yeah they're probably not now i don't think so oh you don't think that's true no no because a  rod he's i he i think they were doing some some stuff there sure yeah and to make love to madonna  she's had it by the best of them she's probably you gotta probably do some weird print stuff like  like candles and chant and you know yeah dude bite her on the neck and drink her blood and then  go down on an angle 90 degree angle and then flip around and have sex in a gyrosphere this is what i 
[01:19:30]  do i learned this i created this she's well beyond just missionary yeah exactly it's uh also being  reported that when a rod second kid was born he flew down to miami to be with his wife and his uh  newborn for 10 minutes and then left the hospital off to madonna and flew back to new york supposedly to  be with madonna a lot of supposants today allegedly his wife is hot too well why would you get your 
[01:20:00]  wife pregnant he is dumb i don't think you get anybody pregnant i think you just forget and  now you're married i mean yeah but you gotta be using one of those things yeah but if you're  allegedly doing stuff on the road on the road you're gonna be on high alert when you're hanging  with your wife maybe you got maybe you got caught doing something and that's i mean that's kind of the  way look look here's another kid but what if she wants another kid and then what's he supposed to  do hey let me put this on you take this pill and right right right you know just in case i got some 
[01:20:30]  hangers for my suits that i've been yeah exactly you know what are you gonna do then she'd be  suspicious like oh what what's the matter you wanna have another kid sure yeah oh yeah take that golden  stuff that comes out of there and yeah but you gotta that's that's like oil now for him  uh you gotta say in the whole thing though he could have just said look you know maybe in a few  months or next year or something finding a lottery ticket oh forget about it i'd love to get a little 
[01:21:00]  ice cube tray full of his diamonds are coming out of there that's what it is underpants come off and  she's like she actually went i found i found the golden ticket it's like a wonka bar  that's what we that's what we got everlasting knob hopper  let's say hi to let's go to let's go to uh cleveland good morning cleveland let's say hi to nick nick 
[01:21:30]  what's up buddy how you doing guys all right i think sorry okay nick i think you guys are missing  the picture here a rod's wife is this almost bodybuilder looking woman she i think she's a  fitness she's into that fitness like aerobics thing and she looks kind of manly in some pictures that  i saw on the internet the other day man this is new to me nick because uh madonna looks way  more ripped than uh a rod's wife yeah i've never seen a picture of a rod's wife where i'm thinking 
[01:22:00]  she's ripped yeah there's a there's a picture of him and her together and she's in a bodybuilding  bikini and she actually her abs are really disgusting and manly looking and her shoulders  are cut and her back is feed and she almost looks like a female bodybuilder all right we're looking at  a picture right now which i like by the way she's got quite a figure nice figure oh is that from  sports illustrator where they okay no don't even try to compare that to a madonna

[01:29:00]  it's uh i saw it's heart-wrenching at times the family with like the all the kids had no arms and  no legs and they had a they had to walk around on like an old hardwood floor and their stumps were  all ashy god and then they they actually made a house with shoots they made little mittens for  their their book the little bony paws made little mittens for their little this makes you cry  let me tell you how about they build a nice and my ass off it doesn't cause afflictions jesus at the 
[01:29:30]  end of the show it just they the whole show but then they build it to the point and they put the bus  in front of the house and the family and then they move that bus that's when i'm done move that  and then they're gone and then the bus moves and everyone starts balling every yeah because  this big mansion and then they do the dramatic music and you know surrounded by other trailer  homes the only problem i have with extreme home makeover it used to be like families down on their  luck like you know the father lost his job at the factory yeah and the kids are all like normal 
[01:30:00]  now they have to go with the the afflictions yeah you see the one where like the whole house has to  be like 52 degrees or the door the daughter dies the hell kind of superhero crap is this  the refrigerated people i'm not  that was the worst one ever the whole family has to suffer and be cold all the time because  this one doesn't know how to like you know take care of her own heating  that's fantastic this is my daughter fudgesicle  what a bad girl dude and then just take her to see letterman every night yeah yeah see it's an 
[01:30:30]  inside joke the studio's freezing but the ac bill for this family is ridiculous everyone has to walk  around with mittens and stuff because she can't figure out her body temperature yeah she can't go  outside so the so then her brother decides well if you can't go outside i won't go outside either  so then they build them a huge like like uh like uh like game room play room uh bowling alley thing  in the basement yeah and they did something with the outside too where she could actually go outside 
[01:31:00]  they put they moved to alaska yeah exactly how about that yeah how about the north paul bad girl yeah  penguin here's an ice bucket hat like a hat made of ice cubes she used to go to hotels and put her head  under like last night no problem crying because the marines are crying  i'm okay with that but the families with the afflictions it's like stop you're doing this  on purpose to make us cry here at home i would just yell big whoop how about the dad the one with 
[01:31:30]  the dad and he had like like 20 kids and then the the mom died and then he had to take care of all  the kids by himself god yeah yeah why do they do it you know they it's obvious it's on purpose  that's what they want to make you cry just give some poor family that could use a house a house  it doesn't have to be a ringling brothers uh sideshow well then the ones that make me laugh  when they go into the ghetto and build this ridiculous house yeah in front of in the middle 
[01:32:00]  of trouble in the middle of just like you know a place that looks like it should be i don't know  just it's been bombed or whatever and then you know like the family just has to fight for everything  you know they they have to be on guard 24 hours a day what's someone gonna break in and steal the new  driveway now they give them they give them all kinds of plasmas and they give them all the  electronics and it's and they they make the kids room like they hey what what's your fantasy well i  like mushrooms and then you go in there's a mushroom bed a mushroom yeah you know a little mushroom 
[01:32:30]  you know window and they spare no expense is the point and then it's on abc so it's huge advertising  that this sick house is in the middle of the ghetto yeah what do you think happens after the camera  crews leave and all the people leave that built the house and the bus leaves looks like sunset on  i am legend just come out of the woodwork and no one's leaving that house anytime soon yeah yeah  it's like when they the pimp my ride thing when they yeah you know they get oh yeah black girl from 
[01:33:00]  the you know compton she has a pinto and then they put 90 plasmas in it 20 televisions piled on the  three xboxes and a waterfall holy my god you've been pimped all right see you later we gotta get out  of here it's on cinder blocks before they leave  that's the truth you rock do we have any footage of that of which extreme makeup i've never seen it  oh just i honestly if you put uh move that bus into youtube you could see the grand finale of 
[01:33:30]  every show they've ever done my favorite one is the black the black mama just passing out yeah  yeah yeah on the road that was oh she just passed out look i don't i i i have a a few tears every  once in a while but then there's times where i'm laughing my ass off when they moved the bus and the  black mama and her and her daughters fell on the pavement because they couldn't believe it their  excitement got the best of them that made me laugh really hard i wasn't crying at that one that's  great yeah i can't i'd move that bus parties what kills move that bus i can't even go by the port 
[01:34:00]  authority no uh oh yeah here we go they they did uh an episode in camden new jersey which is like the  murder capital of the entire country or right up there uh mark jersey what's up yeah hey what's  going on back i think it was last year maybe or uh a few months ago they did one in camden new jersey  i mean this house was a ridiculous it was a mansion inside the ghetto and i had to repo the  guy's car like about three weeks after it aired are you serious i'm serious man i'm a repossession 
[01:34:30]  agent yeah that i think that's what i'm talking about it was uh it was a father single father  trying to raise his sons and and he's worried that they're his sons are going to join the gang and all  that right yeah i think that was it and i had to repo his pickup truck like three weeks later  that the the new pickup truck that they give them oh no this thing was like a 98 chevy pick  chevy that was a buy here pay here oh wow what's that mean buy what basically it's when uh the 
[01:35:00]  dealership will in-house finance the person without going through a bank uh why do they do that what's  the advantage of high interest oh it's high make their own rates yeah vehicles like three thousand  dollars they're going to charge them like eight thousand dollars and no bank is going to give them a  loan anyway why do they do that they get a few payments from the sucker and then they get the  pretty much brand new car back they wrecked the guy's credit  guys got hard credit anyway that's why you can't go through a bank right okay thank you he's a bum

[01:41:00]  selena yeah um god i don't remember really really don't remember movies don't make you cry  uh i guess you know a little choked up here and there oh no last time you wrote a check to your  ex-wife all right you're right every every three months i cry there you go steve from bay  show is saying anthony teared up when he heard about the hitler's wax head incident yeah 
[01:41:30]  by putting the wax head into a headlock that's wonderful all right here's uh last night just a  just a clip extreme home makeover with the marine with the one leg it's huge man i'm trying to look  at every bit of detail man there's so much heart that went into all this after daniel lost his leg  he could have easily just given up but he didn't he didn't because he had four children that needed him  that needed their daddy he has so much heart and so much character and so much love to give these 
[01:42:00]  children that it's it's been an honor to be here this week and that leg represents what he did for us  and the sacrifices he made and he doesn't want us to feel sorry for him why are you wants us to um  persevere like he does marine one leg all right i just figured it out one of the things that does 
[01:42:30]  make me cry is that sound bed in the back man of course they put the cry music sure 16 candles  little sound bed in the back yeah they put this the music to make you feel bad oh you want big  tent circus music yeah no a bunch of asses i don't think they really need to like you know  pump up the emotion there the guy's walking around on a fake leg the slow acoustic jam in the back  yeah that's fighting for our country calculated my friend you know what they did they that'd be  that'd be funny if they did have his old leg and they framed it and stuck it on the wall just 
[01:43:00]  just to honor it honor it this is what this house represents here's uh one more clip  how does that feel wow i feel that my life has truly changed i've been through some stuff i can't  even believe i've made it through when there was times that i truly wanted to give up  my kids were my strength and my marine brothers and my army brothers and my wounded brothers and people 
[01:43:30]  that lost a lot more than me they were my strength i don't believe on the hero i did this for my  brothers and i did this for my family and i would do it all again but to know that people appreciate it  and just see them come together with that appreciation and that love and create that house  it means all the everything in the world to me that's the worst clip from the show come on 
[01:44:00]  yeah there's a clip where they show the flagpole and all the marines are crying well is it good  audio though or can you not hear it yeah you just hear like grown men tough grown tough men just  crying and hugging each other oh geez that that would make you cry anthony that wasn't no the other  clip was a little more intense than that anthony's very sensitive i'm surprised i'm very sensitive  why do you fight that how do you block that part of yourself yeah why do you block the  um sometimes sometimes during a movie if it i feel a little emotional i'll bite my tongue real 
[01:44:30]  hard really so i don't um yeah why don't you just let it out i got a little because uh it's  gay because if you let it out it's all gonna come out it's fruity it's all gonna come out it's all  gonna come what watch that i'll sit there  i don't think it's gay to cry as long as you're not crying all the time  not i spend it yeah i don't think you should be crying every week i used up all my crying as a  kid every once in a while i don't think there's i don't think there's anything wrong i cried all  the time at the drop of a hat i cried as a kid i was being asked this weekend uh what do you know

[01:46:30]  or the fifth grade or something like that and uh uh i had to bring in these italian things you know it  was for whatever your culture was so my mother didn't want to make anything so she goes to the  store and she buys these little cookie things in a box and dumps them out in a bowl and put saran  wrap over them and i bring them in it's supposed to be like she made it or something and they looked  like little puffs of duty that's what it looked like and everyone was like eww anthony brought duty  cookies eww anthony brought duty cookies so except the german kid 
[01:47:00]  he brought out the video camera and there was two girls in a cup  the german boy throwing those cookies on his  so i went home crying to my mommy they said i brought duty cookies just crying like a little fruit  oh always that's sad though everybody made because they made fun of my duty cookies your 
[01:47:30]  mother's lazy and yes i felt like it was horrible that i had been uh you know yeah but what if it  went the other way and everybody was like wow look at these cookies are the best then you would  have been a superstar and it would have been great exactly your sweaty duty cookies they probably sweated  because the uh yeah they were horrible they looked like little nuggets  hey a couple more phone calls before break craig on long island craig yeah hey what's going on  fellas what's up craig just once i'd like to see the episode when uh they knock down you know just 
[01:48:00]  like uh like the movie the jerk they knock down the old crap hole and just build a bigger crap hole  yeah they got this whole idea for the show from the jerk yeah basically yeah but you got to build  another hole yeah so you're saying they shouldn't build they shouldn't build it as nice as they do  they should just upgrade it a little bit like they should just leave the outside crappy and just redo 
[01:48:30]  the inside fantastic looks like leave it outside just looks like a crap hole and inside it's just all  mahogany and plasma and gold and do what the mafia does yeah mafia they know how to do that yeah  they don't they don't build something that looks great on the uh the outside they're not stupid they  don't want to you know draw attention themselves yeah but you walk into some of these houses and  you're like wow palatial yeah just get a couple like uh cement lions put out in the front yeah  throw them off cement over your yard cement the yard take all the grass up cement everything paint

[01:50:00]  didn't even give him a new hat they just or wigs they just straighten out the one he's got on  they give him a coupon because they're always crooked they give him a coupon for a tattoo tattooed  eyebrows they change their facial expression once a week this week you're happy next week you're  going to be sad in june you're going to be angry the whole month because because our happy guys taking  off august and july you want a lifetime supply of visine

[02:00:30]  it was very and we talk about the news a lot and it's very uh relevant it's not the news i went  you're starting to think that it's the news because you're dating jill nicolini and i don't blame you  but the rest of us are not buying that they're actually doing something important with their time  on tv they're a bunch of hacks i don't whoa hey hacks and alcoholics that's what i say don't say  that right not true it's the news is it's very uh run like a fine-tuned machine over there that's 
[02:01:00]  what i noticed being in there they might as well be bloggers they're not bloggers they're pretty  much bloggers the news they're video bloggers that's what they are they stink just because  you're dating the the traffic vixen you know that's cool and i understand why you're saying what you say  but look i'm not dating anyone over there they're a bunch of hacks i'd like to down a few if you know  what i mean what who doesn't like having a drink or two i'm i'm sure they have and not during working 
[02:01:30]  hours that's crazy they have a little booze right between their legs they go to commercial and they're  just look i defy you to see that or i'm a nobody i want to be walter cronkite but instead i'm a hack  what do you got to say things like that for they're very nice people you know cnn  fox msnbc they're in the number one market in the country new york doing the news local news on 
[02:02:00]  channel 11 hacks they still have to do their own makeup right no yes they do no there's hair and  makeup people there they probably have to set up the cameras and then run in front of them  yeah he is before the commercial ends the guy has his own little tissue paper he puts around  his own yeah yeah this is not true not at all it's wonderful over there let's get into something  i'm gonna need the stunt brain for this one what what's uh you've heard the black uh national anthem 
[02:02:30]  before what i made up my own once i'm sure there's a bunch of people making up their own out there  uh boy would we'd love to but uh that would be a firing offense of course it would i saw the uh  the rules back in the old days we could have broken into about 18 song parodies right now or played a  few uh the house next door to me was remember that one we would have had a whole contest make up your  own black was sold to remember that one yes we do stunt brain what's this about this happened in 
[02:03:00]  denver i know that much yeah last week the uh mayor of denver was holding a state of the city  address invited a woman to sing the anthem the national anthem to start the event right and she  did but she put the words to the black national anthem to the tune of our american national anthem  oh my god no no one knew this was coming right nobody knew she said only three people knew the  mayor and everyone in attendance the mayor knew no he was quite shocked the mayor and everyone in 
[02:03:30]  attendance why don't they stop her well it makes the mayor look bad don't you think they thought  she was initially going to do some kind of funky intro and then get into it because she's a jazz  singer but she never changed it and then never sang the words to our national anthem it's kind of  awkward because it goes out live i guess like what do you do uh you thank her off the stage go there's  no this isn't the time for this thank you lucia at this time please welcome renee martin to  sing our national anthem our national anthem our lift every voice and sing 
[02:04:00]  till earth and heaven  ring i'm stopping on this isn't it this isn't the one  i don't even know what she's singing this isn't the national anthem what were those lyrics oh i 
[02:04:30]  don't even understand what she's trying to say lift every voice and sing yeah lift every  voice lift it's not lifting oh man i got a few lifts of course we do yikes  ring with the harmony  of  liberty 
[02:05:00]  let our  someone just say what the f you heard that in the background i'm not sure if i did that was in  your own brain it sounded like someone said what the really let me go back listen back  right there why is everyone being polite just someone should say something like what are you  doing they probably thought she just forgot the lyrics and she's just trying to get when someone  forgets the lyrics to the national anthem they get booed immediately i don't care where it is you 
[02:05:30]  knew she was doing something but what she's singing here's probably why she didn't stop because  she's not singing anything controversial obviously change but it's not like these are bad lyrics it  doesn't matter the statement that it makes by singing is is offensive i agree but that's why  they probably didn't know what to do yeah but they might have thought she was just singing uh  the the you know there's always the lost verse that you never knew yeah you know what i mean  boy am i stupid i don't remember this one this is the long version they sang originally yeah nobody 
[02:06:00]  wants to be the dummy that interrupts when it was like the real lead-in for the actual song like  you don't know is this the actual way it's supposed to be something yeah she's not singing black  people rise up yeah against the white cracker say can y'all see i mean it's not a radical version  the angst that we feels exactly who was cursing the person in the background on the song did they  dump oh just because i said it yeah you can't even hear it i don't even know if it if you you did  hear that by the way oh because uh anthony brought up that they might be saying what the f in the 
[02:06:30]  background who cares jesus christ keep it safe keep it safe keep it safe for the children wow  you use your tongue prettier than a twenty dollar  loud as the 
[02:07:00]  how did you see that jerk  hey where are the white women at  has taught us i got it from a negro  a song full of hope  has brought  okay terrific 
[02:07:30]  facing the  rising sun  of  new day  oh my god  stop squeezing words in  how many words  well  let us  march  on  till  victory 
[02:08:00]  is  won  victory is one okay  i don't think that one's gonna catch on  too wordy  see they didn't even know when  to clap  they were like  uh  is it over  it's not like a black person's song that could have been anybody  they didn't know  then people might think that they intro the national anthem wrong  like you might think that she was supposed to do  no one probably thinks  that she's just improv-ing or changing this because it actually  sounds like it's what she was meant to do 
[02:08:30]  if it was at a phillies game she would have got batteries thrown at her  oh my god  oh  wow  yeah  but nobody knew maybe the guy made a mistake  and this was the verse you're supposed to sing and then you don't want to get up  and yell at her because the guy made a mistake in his intro right  so it's a tough position to be  everyone was confused hey you guys remember the story from um  falmouth uh  the old guy was fishing with his little  little grandchild  oh yeah pushed into the water yeah  and then the kid he's allowed to make one phone call and he decided that he  needed to call his buddy and brag about what he did 
[02:09:00]  that was falmouth uh  you know up there in cape cod sure  this story of uh the yankee uh red sox thing  comes from falmouth another one  it's a hotbed of activity for the opian anthony show seems to be  this is uh how it went down a father beaten with a  as his family watches in horror  a group of young people harassing them about being yankee fans  hi frank that's right a man with a bat allegedly went up to a car with new  york license plates started accusing the family  harassing them because they're apparently yankees fans the father got out of the 
[02:09:30]  car and that's when the situation became violent  absolutely ridiculous absolutely ridiculous  people in falmouth can't believe one of their fellow residents would  allegedly attack a dad and his kids  accusing them of being yankees fans just because they had new york plates  a little bit silly oh they didn't even have like the no yankee it just had  hats or nothing huh just new york place it didn't have the yankee logo or  nothing it was just someone just put a bullet in the sky how do they find that 
[02:10:00]  odd though roach how do they find that odd that is so  typical of of boston and and the massachusetts uh oh wait a minute and it's  odd because it's just a it's just a new york plate you know how many you drive  around boston you're gonna see a bunch of new york plates i've been cursed at  just for uh being in a yes i have car with if you recall i had my new york  place up there about three years into my uh residence in uh massachusetts yeah  knowing we'd go back someday and uh oh i was always getting it especially 
[02:10:30]  seriously yeah especially when you know it was a yankee uh  red sox uh series things like that nobody in new york notices massachusetts  place we don't care i know don't even care  yeah but from but do you do you root for the  but for the most part they don't care up there either  are they really a lot of no they don't they do more so than new york that's  that's you guys are crazy get out you're crazy let me tell you something you're nuts 
[02:11:00]  next time you're up in boston look around there's so many people driving around with new york plates  more so in massachusetts do they do they care about this whole goddamn yankee thing  and they look at new yorkers and just think yankee thing  oh it's the same it's the same i'll tell you why no it's not absolutely new manhattan  you don't get red sox suck chants everywhere you go manhattan has manhattan has uh more uh you  know people from all over the world there's not new yorkers in manhattan but if you go to brooklyn 
[02:11:30]  uh the bronx when was the last time you heard a red sox suck chant here in new york at  a set at another event at any event that isn't even because we don't suck you go to a celtics  game yankees suck we're really good suck all right we get it right everywhere you go dude i  performed in both i'm telling everywhere you go they're more likely to get new york yankees suck  in a boston venue that has nothing to do with sports right then in a new york venue that has  nothing to do with sports because the the new yorkers are not as focused on the red sox 
[02:12:00]  because new york typically hasn't lost a rivalry so they're not the big demon to new york  all right so a red sox fan drives around the bronx with massachusetts uh plates no one's gonna  harass him no one's gonna harass them i've seen yankee fans scream at an old lady's face after  a yankee game that's right i mean you suck and the lady was like almost died you will get that on  both sides yes but i'm saying you're more likely to face that in boston than you are here of course  and you're talking about in in the bronx that's where the yankees play this was not right outside of  fenway you know you know what i mean it's like all right let's pick mastic that's another 
[02:12:30]  asshole no not nearly people don't associate automatically massachusetts with red sox because  the rivalry is not as important to boston new york it's the first they don't think of 9 11 they  don't think of the statue of liberty right they don't think of the empire state building  they're obsessed what do they do wait a minute so if i'm in boston and i have a new york play  yeah okay i say we just fight but i'm telling you let's just fight fight they are uh and again 
[02:13:00]  like if you mention a sports team like in philly if you mention another team they'll bully you  but they will just start with uh because they become obsessed everywhere because of historically  the ass kicking bruins came celtics came last time you were at a bruins game i've seen clips  you don't go to sporting events i know a bar okay i've been to a few bars i can argue that  brought up a bruins game a bruins game you've never been to a bruins you know when i was at the celtics 
[02:13:30]  game you've never been to a celtics all right i dreamt i was there once now you're fibbing what  about when you're at wimbledon yes at wimbledon they actually start chanting people from boston man i  wish i'd like tennis because i heard it was a good one too yesterday oh with this uh nadal and  federer they're saying one of the greatest finals ever exactly that's the action i was hoping the  level of excitement that gets conjured up during a tennis discussion i wish i could get into tennis 
[02:14:00]  because it sounded like it was a doozy also ringle star uh 68 today we want to mention that wow 68 it  isn't to say that a man a red sox fan in the bronx is going to get hassled absolutely no one is saying  that new york fans aren't dicks too of course the level is different there than it than it is there's  a much larger blast radius of hatred up there well you guys i think i mean maybe i would i went to a  yankees game with the red sox i sat in the bleachers and had a shirt on and they weren't i i kept it 
[02:14:30]  hidden and talked to everybody around me made friends with everybody and then i unzipped my shirt  and it was almost i was like it's too late we're already friends we've been talking for 20 minutes  and they were cool but uh may i mean maybe maybe you're right there's also two teams here  i i i don't think they are in boston it's just the red sox so it's like for them it's all focused on  one team whereas here you have the yankees and the mets you see you i mean even though i think the  yankees have probably more people but the mets have enough of the fans where it breaks it down the  middle i think sports are more important in cities like uh boston and philly and when i lived in buffalo 
[02:15:00]  it was all about the bills all about the sabers because there's not there's not other things going on  that distract you it's all about the sports teams right here we have these little things like  dumb libraries and museums broadway dumb stuff that's what you're doing as you're saying  new yorkers go to the library they certainly do you know how many people from the bronx i see  in moma i like your moment joe thank you here's more of the audio found with massachusetts yankees fans 
[02:15:30]  just because they had new york plates yeah a little bit silly i've been a red sox fan for  since i was six i guess and at no point did i ever think that it was that important around 10  friday night this man 20 year old robert korea and his buddies smashed the new yorker's car leaving  dents four to six inches deep police say they were stuck in bumper to bumper traffic after the felmouth  fireworks show and one thing led to another you get out of the car asked the kids to cool it and 
[02:16:00]  he was um hit with a baseball bat this guy's stupid you don't get out of your car and go cool  it yeah never get out of the car i learned that it's called the reginal denny i got knocked out and  kicked in the face for 20 minutes did you yeah i got the last words i remember i'll just go talk to  him that doesn't work and i opened the hyundai door oh and i woke up five hours later with lips oh my  lips was so swollen is this a real story yeah you just got i was let me tell you something i went 
[02:16:30]  from i met this girl one of the prettiest girls i've ever been with in my life and we went on a date  we sat on the roof of my hyundai by the uh by the the ocean in quincy and uh we just let the  i remember the wind was romantic the moon was coming out and the sun oh it was so we were kissing and  you know you haven't met a girl that you don't even want to have sex with you just want to kiss  her because you don't want to ruin it because you really like her that's that's the type of night 
[02:17:00]  we had we just made out and we pulled up to her we pulled up to her mom's house her grandmother's house  and uh was sitting there kissing and it was like threesome best nights of my life oh jesus  and then all of a sudden just uh high beams shot through the back windshield  mm-hmm like a horror movie and she went oh my god louie oh no oh not louie  i went who's my voice went up you're trying to be casual like you know oh no damn well who louie

[02:43:30]  alligators and the alligator took no fucking he's just waiting the alligator was like i know this  routine go ahead you know it took me a while to learn this but i figured it out i shut my mouth  you're fucked i'll become boots for this trick alligator rips off arm on youtube his hand was  not in the alligator's mouth more than a nanosecond basically they'd have to go to the replay to see  if the ball crossed the plane yeah exactly his arm you can almost hear him going and then i 
[02:44:00]  oh that alligator bit and rolled and then giggled he knew exactly what he had to do to rip his arm off  sure this video on youtube is alligator rips off arm and if you're looking for what category it's in  it's tagged under comedy good of course it's hysterical hey uh pat from it it's under comedy  because it was labeled by the alligator he sent it in that's right at first it was under delicious  nobody found it 
[02:44:30]  he's got his little nathan's yellow thing they were all banging it in the audience  nice pat pat's famous pat is famous he's a famous uh guy in the uh food eating uh competition  now pat nathan's hot dog eating contest joey won again that second year in a row right uh yeah second  year in a row he edged me out well how many edged you out yeah how many do you eat uh i ate uh let me  think well it was reported as as 19 but i actually ate 20 there's an investigation i've launched you're 
[02:45:00]  off by 40. 39 i think but pat is that the best you've done let's not make it worse than it is  is that the best you've done though uh no i've done somebody's sending me messages god he's saying cut  the shit yeah i'll be seeing you soon oh yeah it's your feet they're going do you remember us  asshole fucking stop it cut the malarkey what's the most you've eaten that nathan uh well actually i 
[02:45:30]  don't know if you know they shortened the contest yes they did 10 minutes instead of uh what was it  12 yes do you know why they did that i know because i'm pretty sure in the bylaws no they found some  obscure piece of paper that was hidden in an attic or something that's bullshit and they realized that  the original contest was actually what the whole thing yeah i think uh i think this is my guess and my  opinion here it's just to keep people from exploding like that french gentleman in that restaurant 
[02:46:00]  they didn't want they didn't want any anyone getting hurt give me a bucket it wasn't a bun by  the way it was a wafer a wafer converting it to the oh well sorry why am i correct no i'm an ass so uh  then they had to do an overtime after eating yeah five dog uh sudden death stay too fast there really  would be sudden death i saw you making those faces and before you were introduced i was taking 
[02:46:30]  a little confused on the stairs you didn't know whether to go up or down where am i no actually  they had the the espn guy like directing the guy in front of me and he's going hold don't go yet okay  and i'm going now now go now instigator and then when i was up i was like now now do i go now  and then what was the gag you did a little back injury oh yeah well actually for some reason they  do two entrances and the first one i did my usual tony monero uh saturday night uh fever live moves 
[02:47:00]  and uh and then the second one i thought i should do something different so i figured to do the old  the old back pull and uh why the old back pull i don't know i was watching on i don't get what he's  doing everybody else seems so healthy they're like a bodybuilder up there and oh okay what is  the back pull sweetie well you act like you sort of like sort of like uh the uh stairway to heaven 
[02:47:30]  cover the old man you hold your back and you go like you walk hunched over a little like i should  be going oh yeah was it to be funny or just to pretend you were hurt i think i was trying to be  funny oh evidently you failed miserably yes we got audio of pat from uh the nathan's hot dog eating  contest nj.com followed you around while you were training uh new jersey star ledger here we go  don't blow it over me pat philbin is in training the self-employed courier from munaki wants to 
[02:48:00]  make it to the nathan's famous july 4th hot dog eating contest when i get a chance i do the stuff on  the radio do wacky stuff with the eating contest and it's fun makes the the daily grind a lot easier  at a local bar philbin practices a new method eating dogs and buns separately those man it seems  like there's like new people coming on the scene doing doing uh that method and they're getting like  30 hot dogs so i'm switching up my method this is gonna be the first time i try that did the new 
[02:48:30]  method work pat uh uh no it failed miserably uh who did this fucking report npr no the guy  explained to me that he used to be a hard news uh reporter he wasn't reporting about my dick  uh do you ever think of entering a sugar cube contest yeah  people are doing their path from munaki impressions on uh instant feedback uh dog  shit sniffer the great dog shit sniffer from woodside writes the gag was the 21st hot dog 
[02:49:00]  uh so he used to be a reporter on what happened uh he well he said this was the first video for  like entertainment purposes and you can hear from his uh he picked the narration it was like he was  narrating uh fantastic the uh concentration camps did he make a uh little rape joke accidentally and  oops not doing the weather anymore that's when they should just lay back and enjoy it  it oh i'm what oh wait what was that one me and andy are the only ones to get a text 
[02:49:30]  antoine text antoine uncle wetherby text antoine the weather guy came back from a uh a rape story  that the anchor was doing and they went to him for the weather and he goes uh at that at that point  she should just lay back and enjoy it we got that audio and let's find goodbye  i fired fought so fired did you did you hear the camera guy laugh a little did he no i'm just  wondering what's something that's funny real funny oh you hit from the background 
[02:50:00]  a chitter is bad enough but if you have a distinctive laugh like desi arnaz  all right friends  and vivian vance is laying in the dressing room with a bloody asshole she decided instead of  pressing charges she'd married me i took my uncut cuban cock and fuck mrs trumble  wow that's that's a good reference uh more on pat's training pat goes to the qualifier 
[02:50:30]  after downing 22 dogs it's on to the qualifier and a shot at his fourth trip to coney island  thanks the regional qualifier at qvc studios in westchester pennsylvania  a lot of competitive eaters start out in a frenzy but philbin calls himself a steady eater  he eats at a constant pace sneaking up on the others and quietly passing them 
[02:51:00]  philbin gobbles 22 and a half dogs in 10 minutes barely enough to win  next stop i know pony island did this narrator was he the same guy on uh lost who did the darmer  the darmer videos jesus christ he's fucking terrible  this guy's fucking terrible pat here at the darmer initiative padma from new naki who'll eat 20 hot  dogs yeah i well i uh instead of doing it at the old i did a test run that they filmed i took like a 
[02:51:30]  half day off work to do it uh instead of doing it at the trailer i i uh got manny's the the famous  sports bar down the road to let me do it in the corner of the restaurant he didn't mention him he just  said a local bar we did a gig at manny's do that yeah kind of like you didn't mention opie and anthony  there you go on the radio hey i made him put it on the screen  yeah the the graphic was pat uh producer from the opie and anthony so here it is espn pat is 
[02:52:00]  introduced at nathan's hot dog eating contest so down to earth if i had my space i would friend him  this guy i might not friend although i do like him quite a bit he's very funny patrick's  building out of munaki new jersey so they call him pat from munaki from munaki it's a big man  opie anthony's fan traditionally in more recent history the big man hasn't performed as well it's  been the thin guys the kobayakis the test nuts it's very true 
[02:52:30]  this is not a sport i love you pat it's fun it's entertaining it's not a sport that's what i think  that's uh supposed to be tongue in cheek or food in cheek oh voodoo has a nice picture up  i could do that in my younger days what is it what's the picture of she's uh doing like uh  neck bridges like we're used to doing wrestling you were a big wrestler you used to wrestle oh 
[02:53:00]  literally yeah i was a big yeah it's pretty good wrestling clifton class of 81  last century that's when all my good times happened last century now he just wrestles with  sadness yeah and sadness wins it sure does oh god Philbin down for the count sadness victorious  said they went to do a toehold nothing was there  when uh when me and fan had went down to pat's trailer to do pat from munaki cribs yeah one of my  favorites some of his wrestling trophies were just like old and dirty and dusty in a shoe box in 
[02:53:30]  like a closet with no door on it it was just the saddest thing that's where all of his happiness is  in a shoe box all covered in dust it's faded memories from many years ago that was probably  like the highlight i need a drink how about some five hour energy oh yeah you got that five hour energy  in front of you there pat i'm not working out for you oh that's very good after five hours it's  quite a drop off 
[02:54:00]  you just fall asleep no matter what you're doing driving you're skipping you're fucking a miner  i have to wait for him to come out of the uh mine shaft  so why not display the wrestling trophies there pat uh well they they've kind of like come unscrewed  and broken and should we get you a new one no that's all right i i have them in my memories 
[02:54:30]  have you ever won any uh eating contests at all yeah yeah i win the qualifiers although i haven't  gotten my trophy yet i'm still waiting for it there george they probably know go right in your closet  they're like send his last what the fuck's he gonna do with them uh empty shoe box full of  trophies just display them pat when they flew me out to that grilled cheese uh contest that regis  mentioned from monarchy monarchy he's pat for monarchy i was sent out there to win because they  didn't have anybody out there and then ed cookie jarvis didn't know i was going out there and he flew 
[02:55:00]  out there and he ended up beating me i got second in that i don't know this ed cookie jarvis but i hate  him jarvis i don't know what he does he's using the jarvis name to put cookie in front like cookie  jar is that his real carries around a big spoon that's his thing do they uh are they mad at uh joey  chestnut because he um he doesn't really take it seriously he kind of goofs on the whole athlete  thing and uh no i think uh they realize it's not really a sport really yeah you sure do take it 
[02:55:30]  seriously asked him if he was an athlete and he was like yeah he goes i'm just gonna have fun  have a good time but we did get a little mention there that was kind of nice we got the regis  mention pat from uh munachi well maybe this will save your appetite 19 grilled cheese sandwiches in  10 minutes is it possible for somebody to eat and swallow 19 of these grilled babies in 10 minutes well 
[02:56:00]  yes it is and the guy who did it won the grilled cheese eating contest is he a relative of you oh  no no no the runner-up uh patrick philbin from munachi munachi new jersey right across the river  scarfed down a sandwich and a half less and third place came in too close to call why they mentioned  you if you didn't win the contest but it but it's because she mentioned philbin yeah thinking that uh  he's in the philbin in the article and duh stupid yes okay uh we got the end of the hot dog eating 
[02:56:30]  contest that just went on a few days ago this is amazing this is probably one of the most exciting  finishes in all of sport it's definitely in all of uh coney island hot dog eating history right here  and we count the final 15 seconds now 
[02:57:00]  and that's it that is a photo finish right there how do you have a photo finish with the dogs we've  gone overtime before it'll be the judge's call down there what's in the mouth of course counts  that's the very end as long as you swallow it  pretty exciting pat it was uh thrilling ending to that contest was it's not a uh reversal if it  doesn't hit the table so if you catch something coming out of your mouth you could put it back in 
[02:57:30]  oh really oh yeah so if you like vomit literally vomit yeah  yeah yeah well we got the judges announcing the uh the tie ladies and gentlemen here's the work  of our 10th interregulation we have come to an absolute complete tie a tie never before in  coney island have we come to a tie  ladies and gentlemen bring up five more hot dogs and buns each 
[02:58:00]  it'll be a five dog eat-off that looks like the call unbelievable the fans not disappointed  how the fuck do you eat five more how many people are watching this what the hell uh i think this is  like 30 40 000 people live 10 000 off somewhere wait there's 30 000 30 000 people they jam it they  they uh barricaded off and they're all jammed in that area come on yeah but what how many i didn't  count them how many people on tv you think a couple million on tv i think it was like 500 
[02:58:30]  four or 500 000 i'm really getting off my gotta be a lot more than that okay i think so too i think  a lot of people had it on in the background yeah you guys puke after the contest is over no i'm sure  some do that to relieve themselves but i only had 20 hot dogs so i let that goodness are they  good yeah i i got used to them they're they're very garlicky and spicy really and uh yeah like  in my personal life i i don't put condiments on it anymore because you can't afford them 
[02:59:00]  a couple cents op get them anywhere yeah make sure pat goes home with some condiments for his hot dogs  we got some ketchup sissy there you go why don't you put condiments on them heinz is a sponsor of  the martin's put condiments on uh because i'm used to because it would just slow you down the contest  and i'm used to eating them like that all right pat how big is i gotta fight myself from dunking  them in water how big is the dump and do you dump immediately after the the competition uh as a matter 
[02:59:30]  of fact uh you don't dump right well this year i didn't dump yet i was trying to push the hot  dogs through with uh a couple ribeyes and you haven't dumped since the contest no could you  please take a picture of this dump how about could you feeling a little bloated could you  shit now no no no no i tried shitting before i came here does the dump come out with like chunks  of hot dog unshewed like a hot dog casserole no my stomach does contain hydrochloric acid 
[03:00:00]  when it completely breaks down the food yeah but maybe there's a little hunch of it though yeah  like corn up cap and a mudslide shoots out his ass like a gatling gun how big is the dump gonna be  uh it'll be uh significant one piece it'll be of note is it gonna be one piece because that's a lot  of protein that's usually it's gonna curl up like a garden hose there's usually one real big  chunk at first the one that can you shit in a bucket not water and just save it let it harden 
[03:00:30]  try to wear it around your neck at the next contest i could try that but my neighbors might have a  problem dude can you bring it after a few weeks could you bring in your hot dog dump in a bucket  and then we'll have you know like uh pat duffy or someone do a a hair wash yeah but don't do it  do it in a bucket and let it dry out like a mexican hut don't let it hit the water because it kind of  resolves yeah make a birdhouse out of it yeah when you know you're gonna have that significant 
[03:01:00]  dump can you i'm serious put it in a bucket and put a cover on it or a dog will eat it  a dog will think he did good yeah leftovers there the fucking ice there's a  a shit site that i've seen in the girls fun girl takes the biggest dumps ever right and she  shits into a bucket while it's on a scale where is that did you know give it to danny immediately  yeah or she just shits on the scale i don't see that she might just shit on the scale i don't  remember but you think you have to weigh the bucket like they do at the deli counter 
[03:01:30]  yeah she might shit on the scale i could be wrong yeah just put the bucket on the scale and then you  can uh deduct it hey get your finger off the scale trying to rip me off here's the end of the hot  dog eating contest as we find that video oh and they just flipped kobayashi over because he can  cannonball they can cannonball kobayashi just gets it down  and joey matches him we're going for the last dog now kobayashi's pushing it in joey's pushing it  something like a gay movie joey chestnut looks to be done joey chestnut wow joey chestnut the passion 
[03:02:00]  is raw but the hot dogs are cooked that's the most amazing competitive eating contest i have ever seen  and kobayashi is absolutely crestfallen he brought everything he had to coney island today he's a great  competitor a gracious man but joey it would appear is going to maintain that title now like tiger  woods just a couple of weeks ago it's joey chestnut who retains the mustard belt he is the champion of 
[03:02:30]  the nathan's famous hot dog eating contest be funny if you just took one of those hot dogs and  stuck it in your asshole and just gave that last one to kobayashi and then whisper that wasn't my ass and  then he just smells the shit and pukes jesus christ losing the competition right at the last dog  he might have won uh 1.5 million people could be watching this thing on espn was that it oh yeah  what the fuck happened to that jet nose yeah something uh it's like somebody punched it for 
[03:03:00]  unruly behavior will smith got angry oh that's it's an nwa plane  oh okay may have collided with a bird and that's what it did to the yeah that looks like who was  guiding it in d-day a fucking bird with dents i had to think about that one yeah that's the video  of the day the nose of this plane is pushed all the way in well you're saying a bird could have  caused that that's crazy a bird yeah you're traveling i guess at 500 miles an hour but you're so high

All right.  Go ahead.  Oh.  Go ahead.  Sorry, Pat.  Go ahead.  I'm starting to feel a little self-conscious here. 
[03:17:00]  Seriously, though, if you look at it, he looks like a fucking old woman standing front  ways.  Look at that.  It looks like a fucking...  He's clenched his butt cheeks.  It looks like a pussy that just goes way too high on a chick's stomach.  All right.  Why don't you open it up and, Bob, can you take a peek at it?  All right.  Let's go.  Let's...  Stop doing buns of steel exercises.  Turn toward Bobby.  Turn toward Bobby there.  It's my Clegal.  My gay Clegal exercises.  Clegal.  Clegal. 
[03:17:30]  Hello.  He's a very deep asshole.  Is this a banning offense in the IFOCE?  It's worse.  It's worse against the glass, too, because it actually makes it change colors.

It's just an asshole.  Really?  With what?  Did a firework go off in it or something?  An M-80.  Why would you stretch your asshole?  What comes out of his asshole?  A fucking comet?  Bobby, it's down the hall.  Bobby, come on in.  I'm sure nobody's screen-capping on Paltuck. 
[03:18:30]  You're going to pass the legs up, fucking gross.  Bobby.  Oh, that lasted.  Shut up, Opie.  You all right?  Shut your face.  Don't get mad at me.  I'm mad at everybody.  Why?  Why?  Now I'm not going to be able to eat anything.  Bobby, we got a video of...  Oh, fuck.  Holy shit.  He's giving birth.  That guy's ass is giving birth.  It looks like he has little red worms in it.  Yeah, threw a baseball full of worms. 
[03:19:00]  He's smuggling Swedish fish in his hiney.  Swedish.  All right, Bobby.  Swedish fish.  Mister, can I have a Swedish fish?  Oh, look, he's got an asshole candy dish.  Mister.  That's a lovely picture.  Oh, God.  Looks like he sat on Fusilli Jerry.  Can you imagine eating that?  It looks like it's giving birth to a kitten.  Look at that.  It looks like an embryo. 
[03:19:30]  He has an embryo in his ankle.  Or a guinea pig or a little puppy.  Looks like a fucking planet exploded in his asshole.  Bobby, we got something else to show you.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm glad that you guys have enough content for the show.  You have to resort to this, you fucking lame asses.  This is you at...  Fucking shallow shit.  No, this is you and Jimmy at...  Let's make somebody puke.  This is you and Jimmy...  It's not my fault if you don't like highbrow entertainment.  This is you and Jimmy at the UFC fight.  Matty, you have no more news stories, you dummies.  This is you and Jimmy at the UFC fight in Vegas.  Check it out.  Why don't you do some show prep next show?  Check it out.  This is a fucking...  That doesn't bug me. 
[03:20:00]  I told you that.  That's just gross.  Makes him hungry.  Yeah, the way it's rolling back and forth, I think it's fake.  That doesn't...  Yeah, I think it's fake.  Why would you fucking...  It's a wiener barbecue, Bobby.  Either that or the smoke is fake.  It's not really hot.  First of all, it didn't get enough.  When I said it doesn't bug me, it just makes him hungry.  That was pretty funny.  Thank you.  That was pretty funny.  It's the guy's dick on the barbecue.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  He's not using any A1.  Yeah.  Fothersome.  Do me a favor.  Sam and Travis, get some fucking show prep for the next time I'm on.  I hope you use Pam on that grill. 
[03:20:30]  All right, we did show prep.  It's fucking...  It's Monday.  This is for you, Bobby.  Opie and Anthony.  What is your chest?  Do you get a lot of hair?  No.  Let me see.  You want to fucking suck your cock?  No, it's none of your business, actually.  Let me just see.  You want to stretch your bottles down and make your cock a little bigger.  Let me just see.  I want to see.  I'll turn away.  Let me just see.  This is for Bobby.  Go ahead.  No.  How do you like a cocksucked now by a 37-year-old chunky bald guy, huh?  Not so cute anymore, huh?  You liked it when I was cute. 
[03:21:00]  I don't want my gay.  Of course not.  No.  Opie and Anthony.  Well.  Well.  Well.  Apparently, you've got to watch what you say on this show.  Yeah.  Stretch your balls out and suck your cock.  It can always come back and hit you.  At least there's any contacts.  Oh.  Oh, fuck.  All right.  Everyone over Pat's ass?  I don't know if that happens.  How's the blonde doing in the front row?  You doing all right?  I'm good.  I'm good.  Thank you very much.  I'm much better. 
[03:21:30]  Where are you from?  Tampa.  Tampa, Florida.  Nice.  That's where that plane landed.  Yeah.  I'm a little scared because we have to go back next weekend.  Why are you scared?  I don't think you're going to worry about it.  That's one in a minute.  Well.  There's a lot of birds in the air, I guess.  Is that smudge stain bugging you?  Do you want to just clean it?  Are you dying to get some wind going?  It's not going to smell it anymore.  Are you dying to, you just want to get Windex and some bounty and wipe it off?  Or is it, is it bugging you?  Yeah.  There's some antibacterial.  Apparently before I get a date with a woman, I need a date with a Stairmaster. 
[03:22:00]  Jesus.  How about a razor blade and a bucket to put that extra fat in once you cut it off?  Oh, Bobby.  Why so mean?  I'm sorry.  You're right, man.  I'm sorry.  You're a little harsh.  It's just crazy.  I just get carried away.  Why are you a bully, Pat?  I don't.  I don't bully him.  I'm sorry, Pat.  I like you.  Pat, you're supposed to be thin, though.  I know.  You've got weird, thin legs.  I have a slow metabolism.  You do.  You have, like, a 1920 body built.  Body built.  Fuck me.  Wow. 
[03:22:30]  What's that?  Wow.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I deserve that.  Wow.  Wow.  I deserve that.  What a wreck.  Actually, I deserve a real one.  Then it would look like the nose of that plane.  I'd love to know what's been happening with that.  What is that?  I don't know what the plane ran into something.  What the fuck is this?  Ted.  That's right.  You don't know Ted?  No.  I've never met Ted.  I hung out with some other guy all weekend.  What was his name?  Paul.  I forget his name. 
[03:23:00]  Paul.  Yeah, Uncle Paul I hung out with all weekend.  How do you not know his name?  Robert was a good boy.  He was very nice.  Remember he was walking and saying hi to everybody?  Yeah, I remember when the plane was boarding and every little kid that got on you were like,  Hey, Jackie.  Hey.  How are you, Paco?  Hey.  He knew everybody's name and he was telling me about how he was babysitting.  Well, you baby.  You baby with the little kid. 
[03:23:30]  What was his name?  The little boy got a little rambunctious.  So you had to.  We know Uncle Paul pretty well there, Bobby.  Yes.  I don't remember.  I babysit all the neighborhood kids.  Free of charge.  I keep my sign up.  Free babysitting.  Don't ask.  Don't tell.  What the little kid's idea?  Didn't you get mad at the little boy?  I don't remember.  Fresh.  Uncle Paul, did you like Pat's ass?  Did you like Pat's ass? 
[03:24:00]  Not in particular.  Getting rejected by pedos.  Damn.  It's exploitation.  I don't like that.  I like it small.  Put it in the palm of your hand.  It's small.  Makes for a snugger fit.  Oh, God. 
[03:24:30]  It's the worst.  It really is the worst.  It really is very creepy.  People are requesting Convertible Boy.  Do we have Convertible Boy?  We haven't played that in a while.  For Bodden.  Oh, God.  Remember your hit song, Convertible Boy?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It was a smash hit.  Do we have Convertible Boy, Iraq?  One moment?  Why didn't somebody animate that?  That would have been fucking great.  Yeah, no kidding.  I think someone did.  Yeah.  Nobody did.  I checked.  Every day.  Nobody did. 
[03:25:00]  We got it?  All right, here we go.  Convertible Boy.  He's so amazing.  Convertible Boy.  He's so cute.  That's it?  That's creepier than I ever fucking remember.  Oh, is that filthy? 
[03:25:30]  You can't picture the guy with blonde hair jumping in the convertible with the wind blowing?  No, wind ain't the only thing blowing with that fucking voice.  What do you think of?  You got a lovely voice.  That's a good song, Convertible Boy.  Convertible Boy.  You're very good, Robert.  I remember when you was a baby, you'd always try to sing.  You wasn't very good.  It's just the worst, isn't it? 
[03:26:00]  Oh, man.  It's creepiest.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break, and then, I don't know, we'll do something else after this.  Spend an hour in this chair, alone in this room, and you'll feel sick.  Oh, God.  Afraid.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Ashamed.  Ah!  What the hell?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah, Pat is putting his pants back on.  That's a good sign.  Yeah.  Getting the show back on track here.  Thank goodness.  Look at the disappointed look in all the girls' faces.  They really lost Anthony.  What do you mean?  Why?  No, I had to keep the cameras rolling for that thrilling Pat from Monaki segment. 
[03:27:00]  Oh, you were controlling the little cameras.  So you were like directing and producing.  Yeah, because it's like people want to kind of see what it looks like.  Oh, I did not know that.  Yeah, well.  Good thing nobody screen caps that kind of stuff.  No, never.  Don't worry about it.  That won't end up all over the internet.  I don't think there'll be a video of your...  Fatsy.  I don't think there'll be a video of your asshole talking.  Don't worry about that.  No, of course not.  Talking asshole?  No, no, no.  Why?  We have plenty of them here.  I do that with my pants on. 
[03:27:30]  Let's not forget that Robert Kelly's going to be at Punchline.  Yes.  San Francisco, what, this weekend?  This weekend.  Thursday, Friday?  Where are we at?  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Holy shit.  Going to Wednesday.  Yeah, but come Friday.  Come Friday, Saturday.  Wednesday through Saturday.  Wednesday, yes.  Through Saturday.  It's going to be good.  Very good.  That's a great club, man.  I love the fucking Punchline.  I've never played.  I'm excited.  I can't anymore.  It's too small, but it's like...  Oh, Jesus.  I'm kidding.  I'm just kidding.  I actually...  It's a good room.  I can definitely play this club. 
[03:28:00]  Let's put it that way.  No, you're doing...  Bobby's doing great.  Bobby's doing great.  It's the type of place...  Robin Williams will work out  when he's in San Francisco  and he lives out there.  And if he wants to go out  and try some material...  Right.  He always has to the party.  Bobby, you've got to ask him  who he is.  Who are you?  Just Jim chewing some gum.  I love that character.  What did you think it was?  Oh, Jesus.  I'm so character-driven these days. 
[03:28:30]  I like drinking warm sardine oil.  Pat, you having fun today?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's a comfy chair.  Oh, we've got to get Pat  a gym membership?  Yep.  He's going to get rid of  a couple channels off his cable  so he can afford a gym.  We'll pay for your fucking...  A couple of channels  off your cable?  I'll pay for your fucking gym.  Just pick $170 for cable.  You've got to sacrifice  a few channels? 
[03:29:00]  Yeah.  How about we get a sponsor  with a trainer to help Pat?  Yeah, somewhere...  Close to Munaki, obviously.  No, like Long Island.  Make him drive  to the fuck of the Hamptons.  Only Friday nights  at 7 p.m.  Have you seen  the price of gas lately?  Yeah, is that affecting  your job there, Pat?  Oh, yeah.  Not making a dime.  No.  How much do you make a year?  Be honest.  Well, probably...  Probably 40, 50, but... 
[03:29:30]  K, 1,000.  Well, assumed.  Hoped.  But then when you subtract  vehicle costs and gas and tolls and...  $8.  Stuff, yeah.  You have to guess?  Yeah, not real good.  After your expenses,  how much are you bringing home?  Well, I haven't really run  the numbers.  I just kind of...  I just kind of...  Kind of when...  Rent day comes.  I pay last month's rent, 
[03:30:00]  and then...  Are you incorporated?  No.  I got a trade name.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  But if you were a corporation,  you could deduct all those expenses.  I don't understand these words  you're throwing at me.  That's right.  The government allows you that.  If you had, like, a company called...  You'd just write it off.  If you had a company called  Flappy Ass Inc.  Flappy Ass Inc.  Flappy Ass.  Oh, everybody.  Yeah.  Unless everybody's up.  Yeah, really.  I got a year's supply of hot dogs coming.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  That's funny.  A year's supply? 
[03:30:30]  You mean a month's supply?  Yeah.  That's more like it.  Yeah, but he's not going to eat the hot dogs.  He's going to get himself back into shape.  We want to get Pat on Biggest Loser.  Maybe after the hot dogs.  Does anyone have a connection to Biggest Loser out there?  He'd be perfect.  We really should.  Hey, you should.  Well, sounds like a good idea.  We're going to look into that, Pat,  because they had auditions here in New York recently.  You should have went.  Looked into my asshole.  Might as well look into that.  That is a gaping hole.  Yeah.  If you're a deep asshole,  if you were a chick, I'd marry you.  I think I need an ass lift and a ball lift. 
[03:31:00]  I like a girl with a deep asshole.  I'm not that deep.  Like, your asshole starts,  the outskirts of your asshole,  like the suburbs of your asshole,  starts,  but then it doesn't get to actual asshole  for way in there.  You've got, like, one of those long driveways  you've got to go down and get the mail.  I think I need an anal bleaching.  Yeah, yeah, maybe that's it.  It'll take about a gallon, but...  Your asshole can hold a shovel.  It's like an umbrella stand.  Inside. 
[03:31:30]  Hey, Pat.  Yes?  Umbrella stand.  The whole stand.  Yeah.  With the umbrellas open.  Yes, so?  With a man in there,  avoiding the rain.  Let's keep going.  The traveler's insurance umbrella.  Hey, look, it's Jonah.  An awning.  Pat, uh...  It was a little wary joke.  We learned something else about Pat.  That you have a bridge thing.  What is that about again?  Oh, yeah.  Well, with all this handling of my penis lately...  Well, we're trying to get you a little action.  Yeah, well, yeah. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah, it didn't work out too well.  I noticed that I have somewhat of a minor deformity on my peen.  What's all that is?  It's a...  The rest of you?  Well, I looked it up.  What did he say?  My penis has a tumor.  He said, the rest of you?  Very good, Bobby.  Fucking Bobby.  I looked it up, and it's called Skin Bridge.  Is this skin that goes from the head to the fucking dick? 
[03:32:30]  Well, yeah, from where the circumcision was to the glands.  Let's cut it off.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What?  Oh, you got a picture of one?  Oh.  Oh, shit.  What the fuck?  Get the fuck out of here.  It's not that bad.  That's like the red carpet.  Holy shit.  I got like a little tiny one.  Like a little hair lip.  Why wouldn't they have fixed that?  Let's snip yours, Pat.  Yeah, cut that.  Just cut it with a scissor.  Mine's very minor.  Oh, hey, what's that metal in there?  You sure that's not gum? 
[03:33:00]  I know somebody when I was a kid who had that.  Wait, you have a...  It's called a skin bridge?  Yes.  I knew someone who had two of them when I was...  Don't worry, I don't take umbridge to that.  Doesn't Colin have that?  The skin bridge over River Client.  Well, you know, a skin bridge gone too far.  Nothing.  I'll tell you the skin bridge in Brooklyn.  Look at that one has pre-sem on the tip of his cock.  Unless it's raining out.  And that's why Steve Brody jumped off the skin bridge.  Jesus, what the fuck is that? 
[03:33:30]  By the way...  That's a funny reference.  Someone's writing, fuck a gym membership.  Get Pat a fucking accountant.  Oh, God.  They got to put a paper clip through it.  I need something to account.  He's multitasking.  Come on there, Danny.  Find some pretty cocks.  I know.  Find a brown one.  Danny, find a nice fucking huge cock.  Jesus Christ.  Robbie?  Just type in nice cock and see what comes up.  So what are you going to do with this skin bridge? 
[03:34:00]  Oh, look at the girl.  And why did it take so many years for you to discover you got a skin bridge?  I don't know.  I was there.  I just thought I didn't roll it back far enough.  What is this?  She-mail site?  I know.  We end up here.  Yeah, let me see that one.  Jimmy, oh.  I'm kidding.  Get rid of that in a minute.  Oh, this is black jump?  Get rid of that before I cum all over myself.  Don't get...  All black she-mail site?  What the fuck?  I know. 
[03:34:30]  I like the black she-mails.  They have ashy elbows.  Jesus.  It's called black.  Bad enough it's a woman with a cock, but not a big purple one.  Yeah, go to a nice white...  Holy shit.  Get a nice white she-mail up there with a nice circumcised helmet and all the same color skin  through the whole cock.  What the fuck?  Jesus, what the fuck?  It's so big it hooks.  It's bent.  That's what I...  Wow.  That's a man.  Mine...  That's no way to polish a brass bed. 
[03:35:00]  A lot of porno going on on the screens here.  Yeah, I don't like it.  I don't like it.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  We're going to do the line of the day.  They get so ugly once they have hair on them.  I like when they're real small.  You can just kind of...  Oh, God damn it.  What?  If you're a good boy, I'll make you a cumsicle.  What?  You as a baby used to make cumsicles.  I'd make my cum in the ice tray for your cumsicle. 
[03:35:30]  You didn't know me as a boy.  I did, too.  I babysitted you.  You was very fresh.  Oh, I was?  Yeah.  What I...  What'd I do?  Huh?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What the fuck?  That's what happens when you talk shit. 
[03:36:00]  Danny just put up a picture of a guy sucking a giant dick.  Jesus, what is this?  LuckyDevil.com?  That's what happens when Sam doesn't shave his chest hair.  The guy looks like the other...  One guy is forcing his head down.  But he doesn't look like he's really being forced.  No.  One guy has a Clint Eastwood snarl.  He's too big of a trooper, this kid.  There's no way he could be getting forced.  As he was doing that, he was going,  One, two, three.  Three. 
[03:36:30]  It is three.  All right.  We're going to do a lot of the day.  Enough with the cock.  Wait a minute.  Keep going.  No, enough already.  One more.  One more.  One more fucking hot she-mail.  One more.  One more.  One more.  Oh, fuck that.  It's your real cock.  I don't want a snow cock.  I know.  It's a giant white one.  Who believes that?  Get a nice fucking hot chick with a fucking nice piece.  What the fuck?  Oh, Jesus.  Jesus, come on.  She looks fearful. 
[03:37:00]  I like that.  Yeah, she's very afraid of that giant dick.  I fucking want a big dick.  Fuck.  Look at that.  All right.  If I had a big dick...  Come in the bathroom later.  Isolate that, by the way.  Why do we have to go to the bathroom?  Just flop it over the table.  I'll tuck it from here.  Fucking a...  She's holding it from his liver.  ...big guinea cock.  You big fucking Italian sausage barbecue cock.  Wrap your cock in plastic and put it on a fucking styrofoam plate.  Sell it at the fucking grocery store. 
[03:37:30]  Don't sell my cock.  I wouldn't.  Thank you.  All right.  Line of the day is...  Oh, shit.  What the fuck?  A plushie.  It's some twink with a giant cock.  Oh, look at his...  Hey, Steve.  I swear to God, I look at his hairdo first.  His cock is meaningless.  It's that awful hairdo that bugs me.  He's got the emo.  So he's reporting from a tornado.  Sucking himself off.  I just... 
[03:38:00]  Fuck, I got a small dick.  I think he's from Nantucket.  Yeah.  I got to lose weight.  I think my dick...  I'm going to get an inch back if I lose around 30 more pounds.  You got...  Oh, you got the pubic fat?  I'm going to weigh myself today at the gym.  Wow, I got 10 inches to gain.  10 inches?  Roberts, you have a lot of fat around your pubis.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  Who's that?  Who is this?  I'm Ted, and I work for Ted's pubis thinning company.  Well, yeah, I actually... 
[03:38:30]  I have a little bush fat around my pubes.  Can I recommend some tape?  If you tape your pubis all the way around your back, your penis looks bigger.  Do they have special pube tape or something?  Yes, it's silver, and it's sold at hardware stores.  What's it called?  Duck tape, fatso.  Ted, the pubis fat, buddy.  Ted, the pubis fat thinner.  Thinner.  So will it actually work?  Will it make my dick bigger? 
[03:39:00]  Ted?  Will it make my dick bigger?  Yes, it pushes your pubis fat in.  What are you pushing?  Do you push it back?  Oh, God.  Look at the pubis fat on this fucking guy.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Danny just pushed up a picture.  This guy's got no dick.  That's Larry.  He's from Ronkonkoma.  Wow.  Some people really don't take care of themselves.  He was stricken with pubis fat either.  That guy's pubis fat completely engulfs any genitals.  Wow. 
[03:39:30]  That is the biggest bush fat I've ever seen.  You could fuck him.  It's like when a tree grows around a sign.  Yeah.  That's what happens.  Driving down the highway, you see that no passing sign halfway in an oak tree.  That's it.  But you don't know the agony of what it feels.  Whenever one's throwing pebbles at his fatty pubis.  We got a gym membership for Pat.  Get this guy.  Just opened a new gym.  Not too far from Pat on Route 46 in Pinebrook, New Jersey. 
[03:40:00]  I'd like to offer him a free three-month membership to get him started.  If that guy gives you three months, I'll pay for the next three months there, Pat.  How about that?  How far is Pinebrook?  This guy who set that in five.  That's probably like Willowbrook.  Past Willowbrook.  It's close, kind of?  Fairfield.  Is it close enough to you?  Yeah.  For free, it's close enough.  You know what I mean?  If that guy could leave some info, that would be great for Pat.  And then Pat said, what, you need a gym membership?  Well, this guy says, Pat needs an accountant, nutritionist, trainer, shrink, plastic surgeon. 
[03:40:30]  Veterinarian.  And joke writer.  Oh, geez.  So he says, oh, forget it, just kill yourself.  Well.  That was square.  That was Opie from Long Island.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Shit.  Carbonite.com, thank you.  They sponsor Line of the Day.  You guys have fun out there today? 
[03:41:00]  Wow.  Very enthusiastic.  On Star Trek, they perform the Carbonite maneuver.  What's that?  That was a fake destroy everything bomb.  That was one that didn't work on Pal Talk when you did it the other day.  What was the call?  Is that when the man fell in the plastic machine?  Yeah.  Actually, it was the one with Ronnie Howard in it.  Little baby Ronnie Howard.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Captain Kirk.  More trivia?  We are much alike, Captain. 
[03:41:30]  We both take pride in our ships.  His ships sucked.  Yeah.  Walking around.  I had the helmsman that freaked out.  What, are you going to just sit there and die?  Pat, read the copy for us today, will you?  Oh, shit.  Okay.  Can you read it with your asshole, though?  Can you read it with your asshole?  Yeah, read it with your asshole.  Like your asshole reading it?  Yeah, please.  For the Pal Talkers.  Come on.  Oh, shit.  One last time.  Come on, one last time.  Where's my ass going to go when the screen's over there?  Just stand over by Anthony. 
[03:42:00]  All right, put it up.  Oh, I'm not on camera.  There's logistical problems here.  All right, put the copy over there.  Put the copy over there.  All right.  I like to use that camera.  All right, get out of here without taking my pants off again.  Oh, there we go.  I'll tell you what.  I got to go to five, and then Jimmy Norton's got to move a little bit.  Jimmy Norton doesn't have to be told.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  He's going to be in the copy with his asshole today.  This is for the Pal Talkers.  He's bending over.  Oh, my God.  Is that your sack?  No, that's his ass flap.  No, no, what's down there?  You got some on your sack. 
[03:42:30]  That's more ass flap.  Wait, what is that on your ball?  Is that a wart?  Bob, what is that?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Look, look.  I'm serious.  What's that speck?  She's making elephant noises.  Do you see that?  What the fuck is that?  It's fucking...  It looks like toilet paper that grew onto his balls.  Oh.  Rocky workout.  What is he doing? 
[03:43:00]  It looks like the inside of somebody's throat when they're laughing.  Invisible boxing workout.  It looks like Dad got mad and threw the ham.  What is he doing?  A speed bag workout?  Yeah.  It says...  All right.  It looks like a Muppet.  All right, Pat, read the line of the day copy with your asshole.  This is for the Pal Talkers.  Okay.  Line of day.  It's sponsored by Carbonite.com.  Carbonite backs up your computer hard drive so you never have to worry about losing any  of your files. 
[03:43:30]  Check it out at Carbonite.com.  Promo code XM.  Keep going.  All right.  We have five runners up.  And six...  And one six altogether.  I'm not real good at math.  Talk to your asshole.  Although I am a high school graduate.  All right.  All right.  Here's your first runner-up line of the day.  That's what I meant to say.  Well, I thought either that or the Wizard of Odd was in town and the Scarecrow was sitting 
[03:44:00]  next to him.  The Wizard of Odd.  The Wizard of Odd.  The Wizard of Odd.  I get nervous hanging with the big boys.  You were off by almost the whole alphabet.  I didn't even sit.  You were on my 22 letters.  That was funny.  Here's the next runner-up line of the day.  Like, in my personal life, I don't put condiments on it anymore. 
[03:44:30]  Because you can't afford them.  Jesus.  Well, that was a little cruel, I thought.  But it was runner-up line of the day.  Here's the next runner-up line of the day.  He was doing some laundry.  And that's his job.  And he goes, oh, she's honing in.  He goes, bring back the lazy vegetarians.  He goes, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[03:45:00]  Pat's laughing through his asshole.  Okay.  It's a great visual.  Here we go with another runner-up line of the day.  You did it.  I would assume you would hide Hitler.  Okay, I'm all right.  Thank God.  They had this thing set up where they were supposed to do it where Hitler has a little thing at  that goes kapow, and then it says, congratulations, you're the six millionth customer.  So thank God they ended that quickly.  Hey, I'm Jewish. 
[03:45:30]  I was offended by that.  Oh, well.  How is this asshole so deep?  Oh, where are we?  I wish you were a chick.  So deep and so tasty.  A nice deep asshole.  The girl's blowing you and you put your whole middle finger in.  Middle finger?  No, no.  And you put your middle finger in while she's blowing you.  And then the middle finger just touches the asshole.  It's all crack.  I like a nice deep crack.  I love that.  On a nice ass, though.  I like to smell a deep crack.  Are you guys done now?  That asshole should have a shell around it. 
[03:46:00]  Yes, you should.  Maybe a Dyson sphere?  My fucking good joke with your better one.  Mine wasn't that good either.  It was dud and dutter.  Bruce Willis should be lowering an atomic bomb into it.  It looks like he already has.  Oh, shit.  Swim, motherfucker.  All right.  We have one more runner-up line of the day. 
[03:46:30]  There's a fucking light brown ring.  What?  Open it up again, Pat.  Look at this, Bob.  Look at the way the light close a little.  Look at how deep that is, Bob.  I hope somebody's killing it.  Do you have a flashlight?  Here come those hot dogs.  Give me a flashlight.  Here come those hot dogs. 
[03:47:00]  Maybe I got a couple cups.  Yeah, a pen light.  You want to look in there with a pen light?  Yeah, from here, though.  A pen light?  You're going to need a fucking spotlight.  You're going to need a movie premiere light.  A cleat light.  What the fuck?  Hey, I ain't Sandy Kane.  Why don't you just see if you can get a mirror and aim the sun into that asshole?  That's a deep asshole.  Deep?  Oh, God.  Wait, thanks.  Remember when baby Jessica fell in there? 
[03:47:30]  Hilarious.  Didn't 12 miners die in this asshole?  They actually found fucking dinosaurs inside.  I saw two million bats fly at his asshole last week.  The Batmobile will come driving out.  Fucking patch.  All right, what are we doing?  I don't know.  Where are we at?  I want to get a pen light because I want to see a little buffalo drawn on the inside of it.  They're calling you Otto and Gorge. 
[03:48:00]  Evil Knievel tried jumping it.  He landed right in the middle of it.  Pat, reset the last runner-up line of the day, if you will.  Oh, okay.  With your asshole.  Is this the final?  Is this the line of the day or the last runner-up?  No, we never did the last runner-up.  All right.  Here's the final runner-up line of the day.  I noticed that I have somewhat of a minor deformity on my peen-peen.  What's it all in?  It's a...  The rest of you?  Well, I looked it up. 
[03:48:30]  The very funny Robert Kelly is going to be at the punchline starting Wednesday.  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday in San Francisco.  Bob Kelly at the punchline.  Can you upload my CD through your asshole on iTunes?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Bob Kelly's CD.  Hey, you're going to get it on iTunes.  That's just not good, Pat.  I'm sorry.  Try harder.  Can we, like, paint eyeballs on his butt cheeks to make it more real?  What's your problem is? 
[03:49:00]  You don't know how to do it.  Or Homer mouth.  Oh, no.  You're going to promote my CD.  It's called Just the Tip.  Hey, want to make out?  Is mine as bad, Bob?  Wait.  Pat wants to make out with your asshole, Jimmy.  I think my hemorrhoid will do some French kissing.  Oh, you get a little nugget.  A little roid?  You get a little nugget.  What's wrong with you?  You never have a nugget.  It's probably a little roid.  A little one?  A nugget.  All right, we got it.  We got a flashlight.  All right, Jimmy's got the flashlight. 
[03:49:30]  No miner's helmet?  A flashlight.  Jimmy is pointing the flashlight at Pat's ass.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  There goes Bob.  Bend forward, Pat.  Oh.  Get that other kid in here that was dry here.  It's not that bad.  Boy, those Hubble resolutions are wonderful.  It's just an asshole.  The inside is great.  It looks like he's puckering. 
[03:50:00]  He's puckering his asshole.  Looks like after a horse takes a dump.  All right, we got this guy with the tap out.  It's not that bad.  Yeah.  He's an asshole.  Get in there, sir.  Would you smell it?  I'll give you five hours.  Was it something I said?  Is that a scar right there, or is that just sweat?  That's the asshole wrinkle that has been embedded, and fucking the sun has never hit.  Should we paint eyes on him or something so the mouth looks better?  Pat, you should go outside on a sunny day and open that up and let sun get in there and 
[03:50:30]  pull water on it so maybe the skin will live again.  You guys missed Bobby's gum flying out of his mouth.  I need reanimator fluid.  All right, Jimmy, what's going on back there?  Gun shot.  It was a one-in-a-million shot, Doc, I tell you.  It looks like the crevice that something used to be in.  Yeah.  Open it up, Pat.  It looks like if you took a tub out of the floor, what the floor would look like. 
[03:51:00]  Do you see any shit forming yet?  No, but look how deep that is.  When he laughs, though, it clenches back up.  It's somehow connected to his throat muscle.  Bobby, can you see the tip of a doody?  Hang on, I'm fucking tied up here.  All right, get over there, Bobby.  Oh, wow.  He's really gaping now.  It's not bad, Bobby.  The skin is fucking dead.  There's dead skin in there.  Would you smell it for ten bucks?  The inside of his asshole looks like a black guy's asshole. 
[03:51:30]  You have zombie ass.  Yeah, you do.  It's like, yeah.  Dude, can you do me a favor?  Coming to get you.  What, what, Bobby?  Bobby, can you do me a favor?  Yeah.  Close your ass.  Pull your pants back up.  Pat, Pat.  No, he's supposed to do line of the day.  I'm trying to remember.  Did you ask me to show you my asshole, or did I just do this on my own?  Pat, Pat, Pat.  Pat, this is your parents speaking.  I'm starting to feel a little silly here. 
[03:52:00]  This is God, Pat.  Pull your pants back up.  Pat.  Pat, poor Pat.  Wait when you lose weight, Pat, your asshole is still going to be fucked up.  You don't need both mics, Bobby.  That's a deep side.  You're messing with people up.  It is.  It looks like an asteroid strike.  Yeah.  Hey, Pat, you got to do line of the day still.  That's all.  I look much better in clothes, and I look horrible in clothes.  Fucking Pat.  Oh, what the fuck?  That's your asshole, Pat.  Oh, wow.  What is that?  Is that from Star Wars? 
[03:52:30]  I was in Maxim.  I don't recall that.  It's the Sarlacc pit monster.  That is the Sarlacc pit monster.  Yeah.  Is that that?  It's very similar.  Wow.  Princess Leia is going to walk the plank into my asshole.  All right, Pat.  Why don't you say, here's the line of the day, so we can play it there.  Oh, okay.  And here we go.  After seeing my asshole, here's the line of the day. 
[03:53:00]  Here comes the line of the day.  The line of the day.  The line of the day.  And they're like Gonzaga.  I have a picture of him holding his fist next to my head.  His fist is the size of my whole head.  If he punched me, he's got more brains.  I fucking want a big dick. 
[03:53:30]  And that was the line of the day.  Yes, son.  Yes, son.  I have my pants on.  That was the line of the day.  Holy shit.  So did you like the five-hour energy there, Pat?  Yeah, it was great.  Yeah.  No carbs in there.  Gave you a lot of energy to talk out of your asshole, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I could talk for another four hours. 
[03:54:00]  She's talking until it comes out of your asshole.  Thanks, five-hour energy, for the free product.  They're hooking the show up with some energy drinks for the pest and crew.  That's five-hour energy.  It wakes up your brain, your asshole, gets you bright, alert, and focused.  Without the jitters or the crash later in the day.  Oh, maybe after five hours.  Might want to drink two for that busy work day.  You guys good out there?  Anybody have anything they want to say, do, nothing? 
[03:54:30]  My asshole left them speechless.  Yeah.  That's good.  Just like it has many of us.  All right.  And Robert Kelly, Punchline, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday of this week.  Yes, Punchline, San Francisco.  San Francisco.  So all the XM listeners.  Or as I call it, Sanny Franny.  Sanny Franny.  Who's that?  Me.  How many characters do you have?  More than you can throw a fucking thing at. 
[03:55:00]  Really?  Yeah, that was no improv guy.  There's more characters you can throw an amber alert at.  Listen.  Look at Pat getting mad at him.  Damn!  That throws his fist in the air.  I was doing too much Star Trek stuff.  I was thinking red alert.  You can't end with that.  Jettison the pods.  You can't end with that, Pat.  You've got to end with a doozy.  A doozy of a line.  Come up with a good one.  Yeah, come up with a good one, Pat. 
[03:55:30]  We leave it to you.  You do something good here.  I need something to work off of.  Heinz.  Not a big heinie.  Why is it always puns?  I know.  Always fun wordplay.  I know.  Speaking of trucks, how about we're not speaking of trucks?  Yeah, how about a little...  Just something else.  How about them Mets?  You don't always need to springboard from one word to a single word.  No, apparently he does. 
[03:56:00]  Why don't you pick up the paper and do some topical.  That would involve thoughts.  Yeah, pick up the paper and do a little lip talk.  Do some topical.  Do some topical.  This will be good.  And you can do puns.  Oh.  Because now it's the paper.  Okay.  He's going to the paper.  Turf war set for Christy.  That's nice.  No, no.  You don't just read it in your own voice.  I do it.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Coming up with a little concept here.  Oh, now I'm at the ads. 
[03:56:30]  Oh, shit.  Just think of something fun.  Jim's going to help you.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  What about the A-Rod?  He's getting, you know, divorced.  They're calling him D-Rod.  He's sitting there in her ass and fucking the old broad Madonna.  No.  Actually, I think Madonna's hotter now than she was at 20.  Got to say it.  Keep going.  I like sinewy, sinewy broads. 
[03:57:00]  Yeah.  I'm going to send you an email saying, how about some jokes, motherfucker?  How?  Come on, Pat.  You can do it.  Come on, Pat.  Come on, Pat.  Here, here's one.  Pat's ass has more to say than he does.  They thought it was really your ass talking, Pat.  So much for ending on a high note.  How about anything?  Give us something.  Give us something. 
[03:57:30]  Here.  Looking for a hot date?  Call now.  Man with gaping asshole.  Looking for hot broad.  No?  I, uh...  He's falling apart.  How about...  Yeah, come on, man.  It's nothing.  The words are all...  Maybe you're in the wrong paper.  Get the other paper.  I can't even read.  Yeah, it's a bad paper.  Get the daily.  That's the daily boring.  Here.  Here's another one.  Give him the post.  There we go.  He's panicking.  Come on.  It's got the same headline.  D-Rod.  That was the same paper.  Get the daily. 
[03:58:00]  Huh.  Oh, okay.  Boom.  Right there.  Chinese Olympic cups.  How about something on that?  Do something.  Something fun.  They're on little scooters.  On little segways.  Wow.  Yeah.  I'm thinking of a racial joke to do.  I can't think of one.  You can't even think of a Chinese people on scooters joke?  How about this?  Them motherfuckers need to scoot to the big dick store and get they salesforce.  Come on, Pat. 
[03:58:30]  You can.  We need it out.  We're waiting for you.  Come on, man.  Any story.  We've done everything.  Line of the day.  We got Bobby's plug-in.  The fans had a good time out there.  Scores.  All right.  Fuck.  How about scores?  See?  It ain't so easy, Tim.  Dude, as a black guy, it's easier.  How about this?  Scores.  You're scoring a motherfucking zero so far on the human scale, motherfucker.  Hey, you're right. 
[03:59:00]  My left hand is weak.  Black people are funnier.  Always.  Oh, yeah.  Pat?  Any story, Pat.  Pat, here's another paper.  Go through slowly.  Hey.  News game.  My comprehension isn't...  Hey, how about this, Pat?  You and Afghanistan have something in common.  Bombing.  Afghanistan bombing.  Your asshole looks like the front of that plane. 
[03:59:30]  People dying.  That's funny.  What's the headline?  Read the headline.  Well, come on.  Hancock keeps Smith King of July 4th.  Okay.  How about something like that?  Instead of just going...  I could do some kind of...  Do something with the name.  Hancock and Will Smith.  Yeah.  My hand was on my cock on the 4th. 
[04:00:00]  Fucking A.  Wow.  I've never seen Pat like this before.  Read another headline.  You got it, Pat.  There you go.  Come on.  Gardener growing nicely in Bronx.  I know nothing about sports.  So, keep going to the back.  Like, there's entertainment back there or something.  Yes.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, you're missing it.  Home Depot's having a sale.  You're spilling it.  Are they?  What are they selling?  Hopefully, they sell some motherfucking joke books. 
[04:00:30]  I'm talking, Jimmy.  Hell, yeah.  Why don't you build yourself a motherfucking comedy club?  I'm performing at motherfuckers.  Afghanistan, dateline, Afghanistan.  Airstrike kills 27 civilians.  They're Afghanis.  Hell, yeah.  Well, they're lucky because they didn't have to hear this shit.  Wow, Pat.  One good one. 
[04:01:00]  That's all we're waiting for.  One good one and we can all leave.  Yeah.  Looks like we're staying for a while.  Come on.  You can find something.  Look at him panicking.  Go into the papers as quickly.  Yeah, focus.  Right there, the bra.  Be the funny.  Look at that.  Be the funny.  Nicole Murphy.  Yes, that's Eddie's ex-wife.  She was in Sag Harbor.  Yeah, my ass sure was sagging.  Oof.  There was almost something there.  Yeah, sag.  Yeah.  Something like that. 
[04:01:30]  Yeah.  Was that smooth talking, Jimmy?  Yeah, that's pimping, Jimmy.  Pat, you're panicking.  I'm right there.  The hot dog.  Right where your finger is.  The big sausage.  Your head is...  No, that's coins in a thing.  It's very visual.  I'm sweating.  Oh, yeah.  That's...  That's classifieds.  I think I need to look for a job. 
[04:02:00]  Say good.  The weather.  In opening, the high's going to be 87 and the low's...  The low's going to be this motherfucking segment too.  Howdy.  Yeah, yeah.  Sunny with a chance of boring.  All right.  People...  His asshole has the consistency of hamburger meat.  People are suggesting we just leave Pat on the air alone.  No phones, nothing.  Just Pat and a mic. 
[04:02:30]  So he just comes up with something.  All right, Pat, after the break, it's just going to be you and a microphone.  Oh, God.  No phone calls, nothing, okay?  All right.  All right.  We're out of here, but Pat will continue live until noon.  Where are you going, guys?  Who is that?  It's Professor Ted Frump.  Ted, Ted, Ted Burns.  Teddy Rash.  Ted Portnork.  Ted's Match Emporium.  Ted's Inflatable Rat Factory.  Ted's Egg Emporium.  You're listening to The Ted Show.  Ted's an ass. 
[04:03:00]  Ted, Ted, Ted, Ted.  The Bop-Bop-Bop-Bars.  Well, this is Pat from Monarchy back on the old satellite radio here.  I've been reading up on Christy Brinkley and her little divorce she has with her ex-husband,  Peter Cook.  Eww.  Eww.  Well, apparently he spent some money on porn.  I don't see anything wrong with that. 
[04:03:30]  That's about all I have on that.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  I assume that's McCaine, for his wrong judgment on war.  Eww.  He said, even every judgment he's made about the war has been wrong.  Eww.  That's certainly something. 
[04:04:00]  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  There's a, hey, how about the movies that were out?  Wanted, I saw that movie.  Had Angelique Jolie in it with all her back tattoos and stuff.  I don't remember much else about the movie, but I liked it. 
[04:04:30]  And then Get Smart, I saw that too.  I see a lot of movies.  I don't have much of a social life.  Yeah, they had the guy Putty.  He was Jaime.  I don't know if that's a plot roiner, but I thought I'd put it out there.  I don't have anything else to say.  That was pretty good.  I didn't see Wally.  I was too busy digesting hot dogs. 
[04:05:00]  That's the noise from my paper falling.  How about, well.  Oh, how about the show Rehab?  With, uh, with, uh, Jeff Conaway.  Who's laughing out there?  See, I must be doing good.  Eh.  Ugh.  Uh, I think they're bringing it back.  Oh, there's going to be a, uh, spin-off called Sober Living.  Wow, that sounds like fun. 
[04:05:30]  Uh, like Celebrity Rehab, the new show would predominantly feature Dr. Drew Pinsky,  formerly of Loveline, who oversees the celebs during their stints in televised rehab.  That sounds just like Celebrity Rehab.  They're doing the same show over and over again.  I think I need a rehab.  Joke rehab.  And, where'd that laughing go?  I don't hear anything.  Oh, okay.  I think they're, at this point, they're laughing at me, not with me. 
[04:06:00]  Uh, what else do we got here?  Ooh, it's getting a little uncomfortable.  Want to turn that heat down?  There's no heat on.  Uh, well, we're all done with Newsday.  I think that paper stinks.  The New York Post.  How about that D-Rod?  Didn't I already talk about that?  Didn't have anything on it then.  And I certainly have nothing on it now. 
[04:06:30]  And, uh, okay.  Let me go here.  Hey.  Oh.  Oh.  You know what?  Biracial voters take pride in Obama's milestone.  Okay.  I really can't focus on words right now.  Uh, but they take pride in Obama.  And that's about all I have on that.  It's really, really uncomfortable. 
[04:07:00]  This job isn't as easy as it seems.  Now I'm just perusing ads.  Oh.  Look.  Oh.  Ford's for sale.  Huh.  Gee.  Wish I had some credit.  Ew.  Damn.  Well.  I think that's another case of them laughing at me.  Laughing at my poor financial situation.  Uh.  Gee. 
[04:07:30]  I'm almost ready to pull my asshole out again.  Uh.  Hey.  Where are you going?  Uh.  Well.  I'm looking at a lot of cool pictures.  Too bad this is an auditory medium.  Ugh.  Uh.  Hmm.  Oh wait.  Something about Elliot Spitzer.  Tricky Spitzer griped about clingy escorts.  Oh. 
[04:08:00]  Hmm.  Well.  I guess they were clingy to his, uh.  His.  His governorship.  That makes some women hot.  Power.  First you get the power.  Then you get the money.  Then you get the pussy.  That was my bad.  Scar face.  Reference.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Uh.  I thought about it.  Because I didn't seem so right to me at the time. 
[04:08:30]  Dopp said.  I don't know who Dopp is.  I didn't read the beginning of this article.  Uh.  Okay.  Now.  I'm reading this article like the Pulp Fiction movie.  In different segments.  That don't make any sense.  Uh.  Former Governor.  Elliot Spitzer.  Forster was on when his trysts with a high-priced hooker were exposed.  Had repeatedly protested that his state police bodyguards were watching him too closely.  A former top aide recalled.  I've stayed awake at night thinking about it.  Former Spitzer Communications Director Darren Dopp. 
[04:09:00]  Told the Post.  Adding that he now believes the complaints may have been hints at the scandal to come.  I thought about it.  Because it didn't seem right to me at the time.  Dopp said.  I'm a little choppy in my reading here.  Dopp.  A key figure in the Dirty Tricks scandal who has only begun to discuss Pits...  Pits...  Pits...  Pitser...  Pitsy.  Pitsy was fucking hoarse.  I don't know.  Okay.  Well, you know what? 
[04:09:30]  This is really boring.  I just edited myself here.  Uh...  Uh...  Uh...  Now I'm just making weird noises.  Uh...  Hey, let's read the cartoons.  No?  It's probably a bad idea.  Uh...  Crosswords?  No.  Eh...  Web of Connections?  I don't even know what that means.  Uh...  How about career coach? 
[04:10:00]  Greg.  Go to Greg.  There's a segment in the paper called Go Greg.  I think it might be an advertisement.  Well, the question is...  I recently graduated with a degree in biology and have not been able to find a job.  I'm wondering what I should include in my resume to make it stand out, since it's very generic.  The other problem is that I never did an internship, so I have no experience.  Is there any way to convey that I'm a quick learner and willing to work hard if given a chance?  And Greg, his answer is...  This difficult economy has forced many companies to cut back, and there just isn't the need for one... 
[04:10:30]  I'm not reading very well.  And there just isn't the need there once was for people to dissect frogs.  I don't even know what that means.  Oh, because the guy's a biologist.  Oof.  Really?  Show prep is very important for radio, I'm finding out.  Uh...  But seriously, my friend, how do you go spend... 
[04:11:00]  How do you go spend four years getting a biology degree and never do an internship?  It's such a specialized major that one is almost forced to gain some practical experience just to satisfy the degree requirements.  Basically, he's calling the guy stupid.  Uh...  As for your resume, the continuing flow of missives from readers...  I don't know what missives are.  I'll have to look that up later.  Uh...  Wondering how to change their CVs shows...  I don't even know what that means.  There's still a misconception out there that doctoring your resume can cure what ails your job. 
[04:11:30]  Search.  Fuck.  I thought job was the last word in that sentence, but it was job search.  Since you can't redo your senior year, redo your resume.  That will be about as successful as hiding DNA evidence from the forensic scientists...  I'm getting the idea.  Somebody's playing something over me.  I'm going to have to put on my headphones.  I don't know what that means.  So...  Anyway...  Okay. 
[04:12:00]  Back to Greg and his answer.  His condescending answer to this douchebag who doesn't hold an internship.  Uh...  Proctor's job is just one of the many great careers one can pursue with a biology degree.  There are numerous others from studying global warming's effect on the environment to working  so many other fields that end in ology, including physiology, herpetology, industrial micro...  Boy, this is a boring fucking question and answer. 
[04:12:30]  My mumbling is much more exciting.  And it's really not.  So, I ate 20 hot dogs the other day.  And they only reported it as 19.  I've launched an extensive investigation.  And, uh...  And my throat's very dry right now. 
[04:13:00]  I'm hoping commercials come up very quickly.  So, uh...  Hey, let's look at Anthony's, uh...  Uh...  His templates for his sound machine.  Oh, there's one that could go good right now.  The Sad Hulk theme.  Yeah.  Well, it's all the ones we all know and love.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And they took away all the other papers. 
[04:13:30]  So I'm just fumbling around.  It's been fun on this show.  But I don't think they'll ever ask me back again.  Usually I'm pretty good off the cuff, but...  Now I just stink.  Oh, there's a Playboy!  Cindy Margolis!  She's holding up pretty good, but I don't like them big fake cans.  Uh...  This is a very visual magazine. 
[04:14:00]  Not good for radio, but...  Hey, I think my...  Limp dick's starting to move.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  No.  That wasn't it.  Ooh.  Okay.  Carrie Keegan.  Oh, let's, uh...  If you could see this...  Once XM gets that visual medium going...  Boy, it is going to be great stuff.  Love Guru.  I thought it was okay.  It was great. 
[04:14:30]  Uh...  A lot of ads in this magazine.  I was a penthouse guy when I was younger.  I like to see...  Cunt.  Hey, they got a little cunt in Playboy these days.  A little hint of cunt.  And, uh...  Yeah, oh...  Heath Ledger as the Joker?  Huh.  Well, that's certainly a source of yucks.  Ha, ha.  Ooh.  Hey, how about Playboy party jokes?  Haven't seen this in a while. 
[04:15:00]  Why did Elliot Spitzer, the former governor of New York, spend $80,000 on escorts?  Because his wife was a Spitzer, but he wanted to swallow her.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I don't recall writing that joke.  So bad.  Ooh.  How did the country know Elliot Spitzer was a Democrat?  He was caught with a woman.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  He's calling the Republicans fags.  Okay. 
[04:15:30]  Why did Elliot Spitzer's wife stand next to him when he publicly confessed to stepping outside his marriage?  We got someone not happy.  Lisa, Long Island, what's up?  Maybe we could talk this out.  Humor is in the worst, the worst taste I have ever heard of.  I can't believe the choice of humor.  The worst.  You think that's funny?  Yes.  You think that's intelligent?  Make a pie, bud.  Make a pie.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show. </pre>
