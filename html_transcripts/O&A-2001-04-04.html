<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about the disruptive effect of a new, attractive female employee, Melissa, on the male staff, described in highly explicit and vulgar terms.  The hosts speculated about the reasons for her hiring, suspecting their boss, Ken Stevens, of having an ulterior motive, fueled by his unusually long lunch breaks and increased office presence.  They even revealed playing back what sounded like sexually suggestive audio recorded outside Ken's office.  This segment transitioned into a discussion about the plummeting value of Priceline stock and William Shatner's involvement, featuring caller anecdotes and Star Trek-related jokes.

The show then shifted to a lengthy segment focusing on an intern, Brian, who called in sick on Monday and Wednesday, returning with a large bandage and eye patch, claiming a motorcycle accident.  The hosts and staff highly doubted his story, leading to an on-air interrogation.  Brian initially maintained his fabricated story of stitches and glass in his eye, but a physical examination revealed no injuries. He eventually confessed to embellishing his story to avoid work.  A listener vote decided against firing Brian, though he was sent home for the day. The discussion involved staff members Stinky and Jess, who expressed discomfort with Brian's actions, and darkly humorous references to other instances of deception and violence.  This was followed by a separate discussion on the use of body glitter as a means of tracking men's activities with women, with callers sharing related anecdotes.  The body glitter discussion briefly touched again on Ken Stevens' extended lunch break and the suspicion surrounding his relationship with Melissa.

Next, a studio employee, Black Earl, was brought in to explain his earlier outburst involving violently shaking studio equipment. He offered vague explanations, leading to jokes about his ambiguity and lack of "bling bling."  The hosts then presented Earl with a crude sex toy, which he refused.  The show then covered a news story about Arnold Schwarzenegger allegedly groping a TV reporter, followed by a humorous *Total Recall* parody song that received mixed reactions from callers.

The focus returned to Ken Stevens' extended absence and the suspicion of an affair with Melissa.  The hosts attempted a playful, suggestive phone call with Ken, role-playing a fictional affair.  The segment concluded with the hosts joking about the possibility of being fired.

Following this, there was a segment that apparently resolved an unspecified issue ("He cleared everything up perfectly"), after which a guest named Phil was abruptly dismissed. A brief mention of needing Febreze preceded a series of celebrity impersonations – John Madden, Robin Williams, Mark (possibly Mark Wahlberg), Adam Sandler, Al Pacino, Michael Richards, and Chris Farley – announcing they were listening to the show on 102.7 WNEW. These impersonations were comedic and featured mispronunciations and interruptions, concluding with repeated "I'll see you next time" statements.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  1-0-2-7. And on the 8th day, God said, let there be breath.  The Fools. Wow. WNEW.  I'm Big Dick Black.  I'm Big Dick Black. 
[00:00:30]  Well, it's picked up, Rick. How are you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Howdy.  You got a saget?  Uh, my head's deep.  Pretty close.  You're from the man.  No.  What are you, people?  On the door? 
[00:01:00]  Yes.  It's the O&A Show.  Hello.  Hello.  Open for business.  212-757-1027.  What's up, Ben?  Today, Ben's critics, you know, they criticize Ben's 8-Minute Show now. 
[00:01:30]  And remember yesterday, some guy chimed in and said, what's the matter, Ben?  You can't play anything new?  Today, he plays a couple of newer songs.  And now the same guy is going, oh, what, you don't like classic rock?  So I believe someone's really effing with Ben.  And it's getting to him, too.  He's like, man, it's the same guy.  You know, it's the same guy.  He changed his little playlist today just because some guy gave him some crap yesterday. 
[00:02:00]  And now, look, see, you're still getting crap.  Ben, you've got to believe in your radio abilities.  Don't let the critics get to you.  Yes.  You know what you're doing.  You're in that seat.  You've got a radio show.  Don't listen to the critics.  Hey, we should take that advice.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  How are you doing today?  Pretty good.  Yeah.  I hope everyone realizes we have a Playboy model working here now.  And it's really effing distracting. 
[00:02:30]  A lot of people getting thrown for a loop by Melissa.  There's this girl, Melissa.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, it would turn gay guys straight.  Yes.  Yes.  This girl's ridiculous.  She doesn't wear a bra.  She's got big, huge boobs.  She wears leather pants, cowboy hats.  Like, who wears cowboy hats to work aside from maybe a stripper?  You know what I mean?  We've been to a lot of strip clubs.  She walks around like when the girls arrive for their shift at a strip club. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, they've got their little bag with them, their little duffel bag, and they walk past  the patrons at the bars.  And you go, you look at them and go, oh, now I've got to nurse this beer another 20 minutes  until she hits the stage.  You know?  And that's kind of what she looks like as she's walking through the halls.  And no one can look her in the eye because she's just showing off her cleavage.  No work is getting done.  Yeah.  That's why we're making up this break as we go along.  We didn't even talk about the show today. 
[00:03:30]  We're all in the back office.  Rick, Rick, go to the cop here now, now.  There she is.  There she is.  Check it out.  You're human.  Yeah, let's make believe that we don't look at other women.  What are you, high?  What world does that work where, like, you're married to someone and you just, you know,  you make believe that there's no one out there to check out?  God.  I don't know what you're talking about.  I was busy working over there.  There you go, Rick.  You're a pussy.  She looks like Farrah Fawcett today. 
[00:04:00]  How long have you been married there, Rick?  Almost a year and a half.  Yeah?  You used that George Foreman grill there yet?  Yes, we have, Anthony, and it really saves time.  And I didn't even pick that out.  And the picture of Melissa is up on WNEW.com.  You just click on the wow sticker, I guess, right?  Yeah.  Wow.  Did you smell her?  What?  No, I didn't smell her.  I can't help it.  She had all this perfume on.  What are you doing?  He's talking about not looking.  No, I don't do that.  Did you smell her? 
[00:04:30]  What the hell are you doing?  Well, we're all taking turns leaving the office to get a peek, making believe we have business  down the hall.  We never leave our office.  And I'm pissed off.  I even took somebody else's facts.  You took someone else's?  Oh, boy.  It's about time we have something to look at around here.  You know what I'm saying?  There's a hot chick around here that is really distracting everyone, and I just want to say  it on the air.  And I want Ken in here, our boss, because this is very suspicious.  Oh, I've got to tell you something else. 
[00:05:00]  Last night, I'm watching the videotape of the XFL pregame, which was delivered.  Yes.  You had already left.  I didn't want to look at it.  So I was screening the tape.  I left here about, I guess it was quarter after eight or so, a little after eight.  As I'm leaving, Ken Stevens is coming into the elevator, or leaving the elevator I was  getting into to leave, coming back to the office from somewhere at a quarter after eight 
[00:05:30]  last night.  What's that all about?  Something's up.  This is very suspicious.  And I've never seen him come back to this station that late, ever.  Matter of fact...  Looked like he had a few in him, too, I'll tell you that much.  Matter of fact...  Yeah.  Let me say something else about Ken Stevens.  All right.  Is this the first week he's been here all week?  Correctamundo, in the words of Arthur Fonzarelli. 
[00:06:00]  Our big boss, Ken, he doesn't like this place.  He's babysitting this place.  He's usually here two days a week.  But this week, hot, playboy chick walking around.  He's been here every day.  I go, Ken, you flying out today?  Oh, no, no, no.  No, no.  A lot of business to tend to here at N.E.W.  No, no, no.  I got stuff to do.  Meetings, meetings.  I really looked at the N.E.W. situation, assessed it, and think it requires a little more  of my time.  I'll be here every day and night working. 
[00:06:30]  There is something going on, and we're going to get to the bottom of it.  Oh, we'll tell you.  Because I haven't even seen her do any work, and no one cares.  Yeah.  Has she done anything?  No.  She doesn't do anything.  She just walks around looking good with her little cowboy hat, wearing sunglasses inside.  They're like Jennifer Lopez hot sunglasses.  I actually...  Belly button.  Huge freaking handlebars on her ears.  Open.  Oh, my God. 
[00:07:00]  I slipped a mic under Ken's door.  You did?  Also, when he got back.  And I don't know if he was in there alone, but I got some audio of him.  Do I make you horny?  Yeah, baby.  Yeah.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Oh, my God.  What is that?  What the hell is going on in that office? 
[00:07:30]  Something's going on.  I don't know.  Hey, Bill.  What's up?  Yeah, I wanted to know if you guys remember that sexual harassment talk you got a couple  of months ago.  I am so glad you brought that up, because she's hotter than any girl we've ever had  on the show, and any other lady that works here at WNEW, and I'm thinking, my God, I think  they're setting us up for a big fall here, because they know we're going to have to talk  about her.  There is something else going on here.  And she is an employee. 
[00:08:00]  I'm sure she's a big girl and she knows the business, but you guys are already playing  the line.  You don't need any temptation.  No, we don't need the temptation.  She wants us to want her.  She wants us to want her.  What?  Have fun with a fellow.  Take care.  Get Ken on the phone.  You want Ken on the phone?  Yeah, is he back from lunch?  Let me get that.  All those lunches are probably getting a little longer, too.  He left for lunch at 11.30.  It's now 3.15.  Is he going to come back with an ice cream cone like the old boss? 
[00:08:30]  Or will he have something else in his mouth?  Hey.  What the hell is going on?  I don't know.  There's something.  Because you just don't hire girls like this to walk around the office.  It distracts the workers in the work environment.  I'm going to try to get Ken on the air.  Scott, what's up?  Guys, how are you?  Good.  I think the hot chick in the workplace actually goes through a three-phase process. 
[00:09:00]  First is there's a distraction phase, which you guys are going through right now, where  no work gets done.  Wait, and I've got to slow you down.  There's a reason we're distracted.  Because she's showing off everything.  Well, she wants you to look.  Wait, there are girls in the workplace that you just know under their little outfits there.  They're really hot, but they're not really flaunting anything.  Yeah.  This girl is walking around flaunting at all.  She wants eyes to be there.  No question.  There's more skin showing on her body than clothing. 
[00:09:30]  And that's good for you.  Phase two is the morale-boosting phase, where you're going to get there about, you're just  going to find yourself to start getting about 10 in the afternoon, 12.  Yeah.  The morale is up, because you want to be there to see this chick.  Scott, we didn't work on our show today.  We were too busy being like guys back in junior high school going, dude, dude, dude, go to  the copy machine.  Eventually, though, there's the third phase, which is the acceptance phase, where you realize  that you don't have a snowball's chance in hell of getting in this chick's pants. 
[00:10:00]  Well, it's not even about that.  I don't even care.  It's just something is up, and we want to get to the bottom of it.  Yeah.  That's all I'm saying.  Good luck to you.  Thanks, Scott.  Yeah, Ken, it seems, is still out to lunch.  Interesting.  Where's Melissa?  I think she went out to lunch.  All right.  Interesting.  Okay.  Could be nothing.  Why'd she go to lunch?  She didn't do anything.  I don't know.  Tom, what's up?  At the time, yeah, that's basically all she did at YSP in Philadelphia. 
[00:10:30]  She talked around looking hot.  Every time they had a promotional thing, she was there.  She sits there, signs, autographs, comes with pictures.  So her job is to just be hot?  Yeah.  Yeah, because they did get her from YSP in Philadelphia.  Yeah.  So this guy knows a little something about her.  When he said it was Melissa, I knew who it was.  I mean, she's smoking.  So her whole job is just to look hot?  Her job is to have you boys walk around with hard-ons all day.  All the job. 
[00:11:00]  Well, how is that going to make us work harder?  It's going to tease the hell out of you all day.  You're going to be at work every day.  You're not going to be late or anything.  Yeah.  All right, Tom.  Thank you.  All right.  Have a good one.  I think they're taking the lead that we've always took here.  Whenever there's conflict or controversy, we've noticed that boobs always help out.  And chicks, right?  That might be what they have in store for us.  Jason?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I'm thinking management's using your plan against you. 
[00:11:30]  I was just saying, whenever you guys got a problem in the studio, bam, you bust out the  boobs and everything's fine.  You guys were talking about, you know, like how some of the DJs don't like each other  and whatnot.  You know, you bring in boobs.  Everyone forgets that.  He might have a point.  He might have a point.  On to something.  What does she actually do there?  Does she have a job?  We don't know.  She's been here all week.  She's been on most of the radio shows.  I don't know what she does.  She changes outfits on an hourly basis.  Yeah.  She walks around with like a hot, like super cowboy hat on. 
[00:12:00]  She sounds like more of a studio whore than Psycho Mark.  Yesterday, she had no bra on.  Jesus.  Yesterday, no bra, full B's, cleavage.  Her shirt was unbuttoned all the way down to her belly button and tied right there.  Like, wow.  You know what?  She starts coming in in a bikini and just walking around the studio.  She might as well.  Opie, I found out why Pete couldn't fix my microphone.  He is busy installing a pole in the lobby. 
[00:12:30]  There's going to be a pole installed in the lobby.  I don't know what.  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to WNEW.  Let's give a big hand right now, making her way to the studio, Melissa.  Come on, people.  Give it up for Melissa.  You may recognize her as a former employee of WYSP.  Now she's here with us at NEW. 
[00:13:00]  Give her a big hand, Melissa.  Hey, Anthony, why isn't Fez joining us?  Swing it on the door.  Swing it when we want.  Because I hate you when we want.  Yeah, give her your support and money, people.  Her new job here at NEW, be hot.  That's the job description.  And boy, she is as she makes her way to the pole.  Oh, the pole just broke because Pete installed it.  Have a fucking man.  Are we talking to him now?  Why are we talking to him? 
[00:13:30]  Because now there's a hot chick.  Hot chick in his office.  That's the only reason, Dan the man.  Don't think we like you now.  They're using O&A tactics on us.  Backfiring.  Right, Stink?  Stink.  What do you think of this whole situation?  Everyone's talking about it.  We're like, what is she doing?  Oh, yeah.  I get up and walk around for no reason.  You know, just like you guys.  Oh, I got to check something in the studio.  Yeah.  I was putting up an email from listeners. 
[00:14:00]  I don't care about the listeners.  I'm putting them up like, oh, I got to read all the emails.  It's like you get them on your screen, O.B.  Why you got to print them out?  They've had to reload the printer three times today with paper.  There's just blank pieces of paper shooting out.  I don't know.  People are printing out things like cartoons from paper.  Very important document here.  That says I'm with stupid.  Very important.  I had to make 50 of these based on various persons' backs. 
[00:14:30]  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  How could you get a hot piece of ass walking around your office?  You know something, though?  She's not going to get fired.  Ken hired her.  Ken hired her to do nothing.  And we're okay with that as long as Ken will admit that.  Isn't that funny?  Earl does nothing and we make a big deal out of it.  Well, Earl's got nice boobs, though.  Oh.  Stop that.  Ouch. 
[00:15:00]  Ouch.  So, that's that, I guess.  Hopefully we'll get Ken on the air.  She's got her little Western number on.  No, she's doing the Farrah Fawcett slash Jennifer Lopez hot sunglass thing.  Oh, the sunglass thing today?  With, did you see the heels she's wearing?  The spiked heels?  Really?  You look, she had shoes on?  I didn't know.  Frank, what's up?  Yo, guys, what's going on?  Hey.  Dude, the same thing happened in my workplace, right? 
[00:15:30]  Like, one of the bosses got fired, so they just rehired this girl.  She was like 22 or something.  Yeah.  Like, same thing, like a nice rack and everything.  Yeah.  Dude, she does nothing.  She walks around the place and she's considered the new assistant.  That's it.  That's all she does.  That's it, huh?  Yeah.  She gets paid to walk around and look hot.  That's all she does, man.  Yeah, how do you get fired if your job is to be hot and you're being hot?  You know, she ain't going to get fired.  I don't know, man.  All I know is that the bosses talk about...  It just seems like an easy job. 
[00:16:00]  I wish I could have went to college to get the job to be hot.  Oh, sorry.  Seems like you don't do much.  How do you learn how to be hot?  Maybe at the bar that Marco goes to, the cock down in the village.  But how does someone learn how to be hot?  I don't know.  You've got to pick up the fashion mags, I guess.  She was telling us yesterday that she was hired to just sit in the millionaire.  Who wants to be a millionaire audience?  In the audience.  That's right.  I like looking at boobs.  Naked women. 
[00:16:30]  Come on.  I stared at that Kathy Lee for so long, it drove me crazy.  Now we hire hot girls to sit in the audience.  I love it.  So, that's where we're at.  And Ken's still not back from lunch.  And Rick, you're a pussy for not admitting you're looking at her.  He's smelling her.  It's too busy smelling her not to look at her.  Did you smell her?  What?  What are you, a cock a spaniel?  I'm, I'm, a little secret guys look. 
[00:17:00]  And, ooh, girls look too.  You know?  Yeah, but no matter how you slice it, dude, Linda's going to make me seem wrong.  I'll always be wrong for doing it.  You signed up for that when you got married, my friend.  That's her job.  You're wrong.  Anything.  You will be wrong.  All right, we've got to take a break.  212-757-1027.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:17:30]  Let me let you ladies in on something.  Oral never gets old.  Home of the Hummer.  1027-WNEW.  So, Anthony, let's quickly talk about this Priceline thing.  Yeah.  Chatner boldly goes forth from Priceline.  Yeah.  Uh, Captain Kirk has blasted off.  They call him Captain Kirk.  My God, it was 30 mother-effing years ago. 
[00:18:00]  Why am I still Captain Kirk?  The sound follows me everywhere.  Bridge.  Why is there a teletype on a spaceship?  Do you think he has...  You're not with that, wasn't it?  Do you think he has a retarded Laverne Shirley following him wherever he goes?  Yes, F-times.  We are going to beam down to the planet F-times.  F-times 7.  Oh, there's the door. 
[00:18:30]  Bridge.  Uh, bridge.  Okay.  Why does someone always get on and hit sit-bay?  It's one slide up.  Take the goddamn stand.  I see Kirk do that.  The doors are shut.  He's like, oh, sorry.  I went to hit the button.  Open the door.  Like we do downstairs.  I won't piss off.  All right.  Star Trek star William Shatner and the ailing name your price.  E-tailers have parted company sources.  No, no, no. 
[00:19:00]  But who's leaving whom depends on which party you ask, Anthony.  I'm leaving on a jet plane.  Don't know.  When I'll be back again.  I'm beaming out.  Oh, Pricelon.  My God, where am I going?  It's going to come through the roof of the Enterprise like Willy Mother Effing Wonka.  Oh.  God, this room's allowed.  This is the bathroom.  Where's the goddamn toilet? 
[00:19:30]  Now, he dumped a lot of cash.  Yeah.  The article says Shatner is said to be missed that he's had a paper loss of millions on his  Priceline stock, which the online company used as currency to pay for his Kuhner spoof  commercial.  What moves?  So instead of taking a salary, he decided to take some stock, Ant.  What moves?  Which in a lot of cases is a smart move.  For a troll.  Right.  Some Wall Street analysts say Shatner may not want his name associated with the losing 
[00:20:00]  company anymore.  Yeah.  And that's why he left.  Its stock has plummeted from a high of $165 per share last year into a black hole of just  $2.  Black hole.  $6.25 a share.  Nice space reference, jackass.  Black hole.  How many quatlobs would A-Rod be earning on your Earth for your baseball game?  But where does my Earth do? 
[00:20:30]  What a dope.  It lost billions for its investor, Priceline.  Billions.  And Shatner saw his stake, listen to this, saw his stake evaporate from $20.25 a share.  $2.6 million to a poultry $202,000.  I felt the same way when I saw Spock dying in the reactor room in the rapid gun.  Nothing I could do about it, yet he just faded away. 
[00:21:00]  What sunk faster, the stock or my wife in that pool?  I'd say Priceline stock.  Ring the bell.  They're just equally as dead.  Okay, ring the bell on me, William Shatner.  At least when we brought her up, there was hope.  Wow.  She had a pulse for maybe a minute.  I haven't had to.  I lost millions. 
[00:21:30]  Millions.  Alex, what's going on?  Yeah, I lost all my money in that thing.  Yeah.  In Priceline?  Yeah, I was at that party, the millionaire party.  Oh, you were at the millionaire party.  Come on, you are?  Yeah.  We hated all you guys.  We're looking from the stage going, look at these bastards.  They're all millionaires.  Now, you weren't able to dump your shares until a certain amount of time, was that it?  Well, listen to this one. 
[00:22:00]  I sold part of it off, and I bought myself a car, and I got myself, I got my girlfriend  some breast implants.  Stop.  Swear to God.  Yeah.  And she left me.  Uh-oh.  Red alert, Mark.  She left you.  Oh, she left me.  When I lost it all, she left me.  So I got nothing.  No girl, no money.  You'll get nothing in life, she's got it.  Uh-oh.  Mazdaq alert. 
[00:22:30]  I hear in the background.  The price, the Priceline is plummeting.  Maybe we could all get together.  Uh-oh.  Klingon ship.  Maybe we could all get together, and Spock could figure out how to slingshot the Enterprise  around the sun, sending us back in time when Priceline was back at $150 a day.  Then we'll punch out.  Come on! 
[00:23:00]  Klingon Baxter's killed my stuff.  Let's go to John.  John, what's going on?  How you doing, guys?  All right.  So, you want some dirt on Priceline?  Uh, why?  You used to work there?  Yeah, I used to be up there in the teens.  Were you a millionaire?  I was at one point.  These are like the quickest millionaires.  You guys got to understand that, and I was on that stage.  These guys were, I've never seen a group of people happier in all my life.  They all had tuxedos on and nice gowns.  The women, we're just walking around a couple of times. 
[00:23:30]  Black high.  We look like losers.  Well, we are losers.  They're drinking the expensive champagne, and they were, you could just see.  Actually, I believe it was Saurian Brandy.  So, John, you were a millionaire for a little while?  I was a millionaire for about two months.  And then what happened?  After I got to about $80 a share, I sold all my options.  How many did you have?  Uh, a little over $10,000.  All right.  Well, so you did all right.  You made out, okay.  Yeah, I was smart.  A lot of people, man, they just didn't know when to get out, like Rick. 
[00:24:00]  What's worse, the Romulans or capital gains taxes?  Uh, I'd say capital gains taxes.  You got it.  And just to let you know, Shatner did get cash, too.  Plus option.  Yeah, I assumed he did.  Yeah.  Damn it, Jim, I'm a doctor, not an investor.  You got it.  Can't see the voice.  At least I didn't invest in that Asian Internet company.  Shut up.  I'm trying to call him the main number now.  It doesn't even work. 
[00:24:30]  All right, John.  At least I wasn't stupid enough to go to that Asian Internet company.  God.  71 cents a share.  Who saw that one?  Uh, shut up, Rick.  Scotty, get me some PCCLF.  Working.  Computer.  Get me E-Trade.  Rick, when did you get Priceline?  Working.  And what price did he get Priceline?  50, right? 
[00:25:00]  55.  55 bucks a share.  And he's still in.  No, I sold, dude.  It's down to $3.  When did you sell?  I sold about a month ago.  At what?  At probably five.  Four or five.  Oh, oh, sorry, dude, that you sold at four instead of two and a half.  Sorry.  Woo!  Mr. Priceline, man.  Mr. Priceline, man.  Picture yourself in a company that's tanking.  My stock's going down. 
[00:25:30]  Down, down.  Where's that goddamn stock?  Suddenly, someone is there at the brokerage firm.  The man that tells you you're broke.  Face is unstunned.  Hey, Greg, what's going on?  One, what's up?  You guys suck.  Thank you.  Hey, I'm pissed because I can't eat anymore. 
[00:26:00]  Why?  Priceline was awesome.  What do you mean?  You know how you could get all your deals with food and stuff?  Yeah.  You really would pay half off your entire food bill.  Well, they discontinued their price line for groceries a while ago.  I know.  Thank you a lot, guys.  I'm so pissed.  I told you it was going to be big.  The losses are really big.  All right, Greg, thank you.  Here he comes.  William Shatner.  Yeah.  Nice horns. 
[00:26:30]  Priceline.  Lucy in the sky.  Here's the sound of me when I realize how much I lost in the market.  Yeah.  I don't see it.  Picture yourself in a boat on a river with tangerine trees and marmalade skies. 
[00:27:00]  Somebody calls you to answer quite slowly.  A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.  Salivated flowers of yellow and green.  Oh.  Towering over your head.  What a toll.  For the girl with a sun in her eyes.  And she's gone.  I love the bad echo. 
[00:27:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Ah, Tim, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  I used to work for a supermarket as a cashier.  And I remember one day I'd come into work and it said, pipeline has been discontinued.  And all this, I knew it was a downfall from then on, man.  Ah.  Yeah.  I feel bad.  Yeah, I know, man.  All right, Tim.  To a bridge by a mountain.  By a mountain.  The rocking horse people leave.  Marshmallow pies.  Everyone smiles as you drift past the floor.  It grows so incredibly high. 
[00:28:00]  These paper taxis appear on the shore.  They're waiting to take you away.  Climb in the back with your head in the cloud.  Echo, echo.  Echo.  Echo.  Go, go, go, go, go.  He passed me.  Mike, what's going on?  How you doing, guys?  All right.  I had 2,000 shares of that stock.  Yeah.  And I'm about to get to the side right now.  When did you get in?  When it first came out, my broker told me about it. 
[00:28:30]  And he advised me to buy it.  Of course.  It was looking glass time.  Wow.  How much did you lose?  A lot.  A lot of money.  All right.  Hang on, Mike.  But whatever, Ben.  Whatever, Ben.  Whatever, Ben.  Admiral Kirk.  Lucy in the sky with diamond.  Lucy in the sky with diamond.  Priceline stock. 
[00:29:00]  Lucy in the sky with diamond.  It's best served cold.  Lucy in the sky with diamond.  And it's very cold in space.  Admiral Kirk.  My God, come lighten up.  I just lost an S-load.  Ha, ha, ha.  Gone.  Could you cut me some slack?  I've got an idea.  I'm taking all my Priceline chairs, putting them in a photon torpedo and shooting them toward 
[00:29:30]  the Genesis planet.  It gave Spot life.  Life from death.  I feel good.  I feel young.  It's about time to get out.  Kirk.  I feel young again.  What was he waiting for to get out?  I don't know.  We thought it was...  Everyone thought it was going through the roof.  Everyone thought it was going back?  Two hundred.  Two hundred.  Name no prize for a ride on the Enterprise.  Coming up.  Who wouldn't pay for that? 
[00:30:00]  What bastard?  Now he's got to really be better.  That was his gravy train.  What's he going to do?  Go back to game shows?  Ah, they're saying he's in a movie or something, so...  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.  New Sandra Bullock movie.  Why did they kill me off?  They killed me off in the last Star Trek movie.  God damn it.  I'm done for.  All right.  We've got to take a quick break.  We'll be back.  212-757-1027.  Dudes with Tudes.  I think every time we open our mouths, we're pissing someone off. 
[00:30:30]  Bokey and Anthony.  We're out of control.  We're so happy.  All right.  Knock it off.  1027-WNEW.  So we talked about...  What's that?  Captain Hook.  You guys hire some weird people, man.  Our intern showed up today with a patch on his eye.  Arr!  And then above the patch on his forehead, a huge bandage. 
[00:31:00]  And he swears that he was in, what, a car accident?  A car accident.  A motorcyclist, I guess, hit him.  Arr, maybe.  Arr!  Arr!  Well, we think he's like faking.  There's been...  Now, there's been some speculation as to the validity of your injuries.  Everyone was speculating during the day that I'm wondering if it's real.  Because some people have looked under the patch.  I have not looked under the patch and said there's nothing wrong with the story.  What happened to you? 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, what happened?  I got hit by a car.  You look completely ridiculous.  You got hit by a motorcycle.  Yes.  But not you personally, your car.  My car.  Okay, so you're driving.  Driving, making a left-hand turn.  You're making a left.  And the motorcycle decides I'm going left to me.  He decides to do what?  To pass on my left.  Oh, to pass on your left.  Yes.  So, you're making a left.  He's passing you on the left.  And he runs into what?  My driver's side.  The driver's side door.  So, what happened?  Wait.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  My head goes through my driver's side window.  Oh, it did? 
[00:32:00]  Yes.  How fast was he going?  I don't know.  Went to miles an hour.  Mm-hmm.  And you're making your left?  Yes.  And he hits your door.  Your head goes through the window?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Yes.  So, you hit your head.  And what happened to your eye?  Glass got in it.  Glass in your eye.  And what happened underneath that patch on your head?  That's where my head went through the windshield.  What kind of injury?  Just a couple of scrapes.  A couple of scrapes.  Yeah.  Anything?  Any hospital?  Yeah.  My eye.  Watch that in your eye. 
[00:32:30]  Why the patch?  Because I can't really open up my eye.  You can't open it?  No, not well.  It's a glass in the eye.  Kind of hurts.  Yeah.  A little bit.  Can we look at the scratches on your head?  You've got to see them.  No, I hear they can't take it off.  You can't take it off.  I don't want to take it off.  Okay.  No, no.  I'm still...  Look, I'm still willing to believe this.  I'm still willing to believe this.  Peter Cation over there.  So, you got scratches, but they had to be stitched. 
[00:33:00]  How many stitches did you get?  Three stitches.  All on one cut or two on one cut?  No, it's all on one cut.  All on one cut.  Three stitches.  Minor.  Yes.  Is there any way to lift it up to take a look under me?  If you really...  I'd rather not.  I mean...  All right, Ben.  Ben, to you.  I saw you take it off out there and rub your eye.  Well, you were...  No, no, no.  Oh, no, no, no.  I'm talking about the bandage on his head.  Well, lift up the patches.  Yeah, let's look at the eye.  I really can't open up...  I've shown Rick before.  I really can't open up my...  I always do.  You just... 
[00:33:30]  You can't really...  All right, he's just blinking that...  That eye's blinking a lot.  No, I have a question.  Yeah.  All right, Rick, to you.  You said you had glass in your eye.  Yes.  How come you were rubbing your eye before if there's glass?  Because it bugs the hell out of me.  Oh.  Didn't they get all the glass out?  Yeah, they did, but it scratches.  It scratches.  It scratches, huh?  Scratches in your eye.  Yes.  Well, that happens.  The cornea gets scratched open.  Yes.  And it takes time to heal.  And that's the only injuries you had was the glass in the eye and the stitches above your patch? 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  My driver's the window shattered.  Let's see the stitches.  I really can't.  I'll come in...  Next time I'm here, I'll show you the scar.  You know, it would be totally...  No, don't do it, Steve.  You know, it would be...  I'm covering my head now.  No, it's going to hurt.  You know something?  Wait, we've all had stitches.  You can take the...  My doctor told me not to.  I don't want to get infected.  I swear...  No, I'll cover my head now because I'm going to post anybody in the studio.  No, no.  Don't worry.  No one's going to pull it off.  Yes, they will. 
[00:34:30]  No, no, really.  No one pull it off.  But the thing is, this would totally be resolved just if we saw some stitches.  Because I must say, everyone has been talking behind your back saying that you're facing it.  It seems very suspicious.  Now, Rick, was there something behind, like, I heard a story that he couldn't make it in one day.  He couldn't make it in.  Well, last week, he never made it in on Monday, which was a snow day, saying that, you know, the trains weren't running.  Well, that's fine, but...  But, you know what?  Monday wasn't that bad and trains were running.  I didn't say trains weren't running.  I couldn't get to the train station, but... 
[00:35:00]  What hospital was that?  Northern Westchester.  Northern Westchester.  Okay.  Emergency...  I mean, I feel like...  What?  What?  Like an idiot.  No, no.  Don't ever feel like an idiot.  Everyone's looking at me really funny.  Well, just take the patch off, show us the stitches, and then we all look like idiots.  I really would rather not, because...  Next time I come in, I will show you the scar.  No, because you might cut yourself and get picked up.  Yeah, I know I did.  I'm empathetic.  Sticky.  When he first came in, he said he didn't want to take the patch off, because he still has glass in it. 
[00:35:30]  Right.  Well, I think there probably is...  That's what he said to me.  Is there glass in it?  This is a little weird.  You were rubbing your eye.  Because it itches because of the scar.  I think this kid came in with a fake injury, man.  No, come on.  I swear.  No, I'm still...  I totally am willing to believe you.  How about we all put...  Now, here's a little more of what happened.  All right, Rick.  Wednesday, he was supposed to be in.  Yes.  I never got a phone call.  He knows my number.  He's left me messages before.  Well, Rick, come on.  Nothing...  I don't like calling you either.  What? 
[00:36:00]  When was this accident?  It was about my hometown.  Where?  I went Wednesday.  My car...  And that's why you didn't call Rick?  Yeah, it really was.  But how come you found the time to call Steve?  All right, hold on.  No, AJ from the other show.  All right, here we go.  You guys are willing to listen to me.  All right, let's...  I'm just trying to figure this out.  I understand.  Did you get me?  It sounds a little...  All you have to do is pull down the bandage.  I will show you...  And then we look like tools.  All right.  On Wednesday...  We've all had stitches. 
[00:36:30]  All you have to do is go like this.  Show the edge of the stitch and boom.  What's going to happen?  I'll show you on Wednesday.  We're just going to come back.  All right, let him talk.  Now, what happened?  My car...  Steve, you got something on this?  No, let him tell his story.  Your car?  My car...  I left the dome light on in my car so my car didn't start because the battery was dead.  Okay.  And when I got it jumped, I was on the way to the station.  That's...  I called when I found out my car was dead.  Okay.  And then on the way to the station, you had the accident call.  I accidentally called Steve.  And your whole head went through the windshield? 
[00:37:00]  No, the side window.  The side window.  Because the motorcycle hit him on the side, so it threw his head through the side window.  What was the name of the guy in the motorcycle?  You can't give out memes like that, right?  Well, we can always dump it out.  Ben?  No, you know what I love about this, too, is that he can't find to call any of us.  And I love the excuse that our interns all of a sudden have.  I don't know the number.  I'm actually going to be in defense of this, too, because I really...  I have trouble calling because I don't know anyone but Obi's number.  But, Ant, we fixed that problem weeks ago. 
[00:37:30]  We all gave him phone numbers.  Said, this is the...  You've got to call us.  Mike has a good point.  I've been hearing from Jesse.  All right, all right, all right.  All right, that's boring.  Mike has a good point on line nine.  Well, let me...  We'll go to Mike.  All right.  Mike, what's up?  It's WNW.  Dude.  Hey.  What happened to the dude on the motorcycle?  And why was he out on Wednesday in the snow and the rain on a motorcycle?  It makes no sense.  It wasn't raining and snowing on Wednesday.  It was crappy out Wednesday.  It really wasn't.  All right.  What happened to the guy on the bike? 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, what happened to the guy on the bike?  He really just...  My car was more destroyed than his...  But what happened to him?  Wait, the guy had to go flying.  He really didn't.  We weren't going that fast.  But wait, what happened to him?  He came from...  He was just kind of...  And he left?  Yeah.  Wait, wait, he left.  All right.  Hold on.  Okay, all right.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I have an accident report.  Hold on.  If you guys...  Wait, you have an accident report, too?  Is that fake, too?  Yes, that's fake.  Wow.  I know people in high places.  If you guys will...  I think it's a plot for airtime. 
[00:38:30]  It's working.  Let me tell you.  It's working.  Now, he hit the door.  Yes.  It was enough for...  Let me just get this straight.  It's enough force to physically move the vehicle enough that your head...  It moved your car enough.  Yes.  Because in order for your head to go through the driver's side window, your car has to move  to put your head through the window.  It's not your head that moves.  When your head goes through anything, it is the actual vehicle moving into your head. 
[00:39:00]  So he hits your car with enough force to move the vehicle so your head goes through  the window.  Yes.  It's basic physics.  But nothing happens, and he rides his motorcycle away?  Swear to God.  I have an accident report.  Oh, green, and it's not fake.  It's nothing...  Is your car here?  No.  How did you get here?  The train.  How did you get to the train station?  Car.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, listen.  Hey.  This guy is so full of it.  He doesn't want to show you the stitches because he doesn't have any. 
[00:39:30]  I know.  There's no reason in hell.  I work in the emergency room.  There's no reason in hell why he can't show you those stitches if he has them.  Hmm.  And that's like a...  Where'd you get that bandage?  Out of your side.  Wayne Reed, right around the corner.  I just got a four key in here.  You guys will believe me.  It's barely on your forehead.  With this one?  This one's just great.  It's kind of popping up.  We might be able to even look underneath.  And will you agree that maybe you might see some swelling in that area?  No, you can't tell because the bandage is you. 
[00:40:00]  But even around his eye.  Jerry.  Yeah.  Hey, Jerry.  Hi.  Hey.  I just got into a car accident.  What?  And I got 50 stitches across my eyelids.  And they didn't put any bandages on me.  No, it's not on his eyelids.  Oh, no, because...  No, he's got...  This is what he's got.  He's got a patch over his eye because he had a little glass in there and he scratched up  his eye, even though you can't really tell when he lifted up the patch.  And then he has a bandage above the eye where he has some stitches.  A bandage is above the eye.  What make a motorcycle is this, sir? 
[00:40:30]  Well, put it this way.  I just received 50 stitches.  It was a Honda.  No one drives Hondas.  It was a...  I drive a Honda.  People drive the Hondas.  It was a Honda.  And he hits the door.  What did he say to you after he hit you?  Are you okay?  Are you okay?  And then he took off.  No.  I mean, he waited around for the police.  He waited for the cops.  All right, all right.  That's why I have a police report, which I will bring to you next time I'm here, so  you guys don't think about it.  All you have to do is show us the bandage.  I don't...  Everyone is like... 
[00:41:00]  Rachel.  Yeah.  What's up?  People's heads don't go through driver's side windows.  Well, no, it can happen.  It can happen.  Would a motorcycle driver drive away if it hit him with enough impact to make his head...  Well, that's what I'm saying.  A lot more damage would be done to the guy.  He turned his head so it was head on.  Don't buy it.  No way.  All right.  I got something for him.  Okay.  It looks like you have nice, poofy, shampooed hair. 
[00:41:30]  Did you take a shower recently?  I washed my head.  I didn't take a shower.  Did you take off the bandage?  No.  I was still not too much.  I swear to...  That's a drive bandage.  It's not wet.  It's not wet.  It's soggy.  It would be all messy.  I washed my hair.  That is a brand new bandage.  But wouldn't it come off if it got wet a little?  It hasn't yet.  How can you keep it from getting wet washing your hair?  Because I'm pretty uninstated.  Very good question, Opie.  Thank you.  Okay, you're right.  Detective Opie.  Let's see.  Take advantage of it.  No, I don't want to.  Anne-Marie.  You've got to take that advantage.  I mean, and considering how much he's touching it and pushing on it... 
[00:42:00]  Anne-Marie.  Yes.  Hey.  Hi, Brian.  Hi, Anne-Marie.  Hi.  Hey, what happened to him?  Well, I don't know about the accident because I wasn't working whenever he got in the accident.  But I can tell you he's very accident prone.  Hang up, Anne-Marie.  Hang up the phone.  Why not?  What's the matter, Brian?  Keep her on the phone.  Jesus, I work with her.  Trying to figure this out.  What do you mean he's accident prone? 
[00:42:30]  Oh, my God.  Yeah, fine.  Tell her about...  Tell them about the incident.  The other incident.  How many incidents have you had, Brian?  Oh, my God.  We're on to something.  Tell them about the hot boiling water on my crotch.  You can tell him that story.  Oh, that's true.  Oh, that's right.  You can tell him that.  He's a regular over at the Hudson Valley Hospital.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  He's like...  He falls...  Well, you know, like, a lot of people can fall down the stairs, but Brian can actually  fall up the stairs and get hurt.  It's like that Munchausen by proxy syndrome, only without a child. 
[00:43:00]  He just does it to himself.  All right.  Hold on, Anne-Marie.  But he gets tension.  You do that?  What town was this in?  Yorktown.  I live in Yorktown, yeah.  Yorktown.  Okay.  Bill, you work in Yorktown?  No, no.  I live in Yorktown.  But listen...  Okay.  I got a friend that's a state trooper.  Yeah.  Was it the state troopers that helped this kid?  Yeah.  Yeah?  I got a friend that's a state trooper.  He would have told me.  He just came on a motorcycle to see me.  He would have told me if there was a motorcycle accident.  Besides, there's so much sand on the roads, especially right after the blizzard, there 
[00:43:30]  was no way that anybody's driving a motorcycle right here because he'd be dead.  I've seen people drive a motorcycle.  I have the police report.  I swear to you.  I'll bring it in the time I see you.  All you have to do is take the bandage off.  I don't know what to do.  What police department?  Like, what area?  Is there any way we can call right now and verify that there was an accident?  What area?  What road did it happen on?  Yeah, what road did it happen on?  What road was it?  It was in Pleasantville.  What road?  What road?  Pleasantville Road. 
[00:44:00]  Dude, you came to work taking an accident, man.  Dude, hold on.  Maybe I'm embellishing it a little bit.  That's scary.  Embellishing a little bit.  All right, now we're getting on to it.  What is embellishing a little bit?  We work with a bunch of people.  What's embellishing a little bit?  How much is embellished?  Be honest.  No, I really got hit by a motorcycle, Mike.  Maybe my head didn't go through the window.  Was this last year?  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  Maybe the head didn't go through the window.  So it hit the window.  No, well, I think...  So there's no glass in your eye?  There is glass. 
[00:44:30]  From where?  What broke?  No, my window did break.  But my head and my nod went through the window.  It might have been his...  Wait, let me...  Mike.  Mike, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  I always can't order glass for a living.  Yeah.  All right?  It takes almost a hammer to put go through a side window.  They're not meant to break.  Right.  This guy must have got creamed if he could have even come close to getting his head through  a side window.  So you're saying maybe it was the guy?  The motorcycle guy's helmet?  Maybe it was...  Of course, the car?  But he just drove away?  No.  He was fine.  I have an accident. 
[00:45:00]  I'll give you the guy's number when I get home.  I'll call you.  So then what...  If your head didn't go through, what's on your head?  It was the glass shattered onto my head.  Okay.  All right.  It hits.  Glass shatters on your head.  And it is enough to...  Oh, lift it up.  Lift it up.  Lift it up.  You've got to lift that damn thing up.  You've got to.  I'm dying to see this now.  Lift.  It's got to be...  I really don't want to.  I'm feeling really...  That's the purpose here.  We're trying to...  We're working this out.  We're working with...  We're working with single white male.  I'm telling you.  We're working through this. 
[00:45:30]  I'm an effort freak.  Keep the cop.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  We're trying to recreate the accident scene here.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's a cop.  Here's a cop that's been on many...  Yes.  ...details.  Okay.  I've seen many accidents.  So what you're saying is you're in the left-hand lane attempting to make a left-hand turn?  No.  I'm in my right lane.  Making a left-hand turn.  Making a left...  An illegal turn.  Okay.  Wait.  You're making an illegal turn there?  No, no.  It's legal.  Are you in the turning lane? 
[00:46:00]  You're going left.  It's a one-way street.  One lane.  I mean, not one lane.  I'm sorry.  One lane each direction.  Yes.  Okay.  So it doesn't matter left or right.  All right.  All right.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Pleasantville Road.  What university is there?  Quickly.  Peace University.  Okay.  All right.  University.  Pleasantville Road.  And you're at an intersection.  What road are you turning on to?  This is a familiar route because you're on your way to work.  I was on your way to work and school and all that.  You take this every day.  So Pleasantville, you make a left on Manville.  Manville.  Manville.  Okay.  All right.  Approximately, how far back is the motorcycle when you make the turn? 
[00:46:30]  Probably 20 feet.  And he passes you over the double yellow.  Well, I think what might have happened was that his foot, what he said was his foot slipped  off the brake pedal and he kept going into my car.  His foot slipped off the brake pedal.  He didn't use the handshake.  He doesn't use that front brake.  So his foot slipped and he went in.  So it was just, so he's almost like next to you.  Yeah.  And he builds up enough speed to fly into your car and even shatter a window and fly off 
[00:47:00]  his motorcycle so his helmet hits the window.  So just, how fast were you going?  I was stopped because I was making the turn.  But I mean, how fast were you going on that road before you came to a stop?  30?  35?  Maybe.  There's no way.  Okay.  I have a conclusion.  I have a conclusion.  All right, Keith.  All right.  Like Gary Busey.  Keep the comment.  I have a conclusion.  After being affiliated with the show for almost two years, we have a lack of security.  But this guy should just not be in.  Who does the screening?  Now, Keith, you've talked to a lot of people that you might be arresting, you might not be, 
[00:47:30]  and you get stories out of them that you can tell right away if they're true or false.  You're a seasoned cop.  This is really, this is shit.  Keith, you ever watch Cops and you see him in a question in the guy and it's like, this  is so, like, this isn't panning out.  There should be beads of sweat rolling down this guy's forehead.  Is there?  Let me see.  No.  No.  No.  I'm fat.  So I'm kind of a little.  Next time he comes to work, I'd like to see the car.  All right, Keith.  Thank you.  Okay.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  A lot of people are saying you'd be in a neck brace. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  What happened to your neck?  Nothing?  Nothing.  Swear to God.  My head may not went through the window.  All right.  Might not have went through the window.  I have a police report.  All right.  So now, like, your head didn't go through the window.  So let's see the stitches.  No.  You have no stitches.  No.  Well, we've drawn the conclusion now that you do not have stitches under those bandages.  No.  It's not what we want to believe.  We have drawn the conclusion through questioning and working through this that you cannot possibly 
[00:48:30]  have three stitches on any cut under that bandage.  Okay.  You don't, do you?  No.  Oh, if I don't.  You have a scratch.  Yeah, right.  What is it?  It's a scratch.  It's a scratch.  Yes.  I embellish a little bit.  So you embellish with the stitches.  Then you can take it off.  Hey, it's a cut.  Did you indeed go to the hospital?  Yes, I did.  Take off the bandage.  You can take it off.  I'm embarrassed, man, because it's probably not going to be anything there.  Don't even be embarrassed.  Just take it.  Because I see a cut on my finger, too, if you really want to. 
[00:49:00]  You can redeem yourself.  Take the bandage off.  We'll laugh at you, and then we'll move on.  We'll laugh, and we'll move on.  Let's go.  I want to see a cut on my finger that I got through.  Take the bandage.  No.  Just the bandage on your head.  Just the one on your head.  Take the bandage.  You've got to take it off, though.  Here it comes.  It's going to hurt.  Let's take it off.  Let's take it.  You see that?  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Turn your head.  I am scared for my finger.  There's nothing.  Dude, I was honestly expecting maybe a cut.  Yeah, at least a little cut.  A little cut. 
[00:49:30]  There's nothing?  There's nothing.  I mean nothing there.  There's nothing there.  There's nothing there.  Dude, there is nothing there.  Holy ass.  There's absolutely nothing.  I am scared for my finger.  People, I can't stress to you enough, like not even, there's not even an abrasion.  There is nothing under that.  I saw the police.  It went from three stitches to the head going to the window, and there's nothing under there.  Because I was looking.  That is skin on the same side of each head.  It does not look any different.  There is not even any swelling or anything. 
[00:50:00]  Dude, there's nothing.  Nothing hit.  I have a police report.  Okay.  Give me a picture of my face.  Was it Earl's friend on the motorcycle?  Was that it?  Earl's friend, the visible man?  Now let's go.  Now let's go phase two.  Dude, take the patch off.  Take the patch off.  You look ridiculous.  You don't need the patch.  Take the patch off.  Obviously, you didn't have that.  Take the patch off.  Open your eye.  No, I really can't open my eye.  Open your eye.  That is true.  It's not tearing.  It's not red.  It's not red.  The whites of your eye are white.  I can't even open my eye.  How many fingers?  I can see that of my right eye. 
[00:50:30]  I can see five.  Close your right eye.  Open the other eye.  You can't.  Open the eye.  Where are you?  Open the goddamn eye.  There's nothing wrong with your eye.  Hey, please don't do this anymore.  I swear.  You're scaring us.  Open your stupid eye.  Open the eye.  Open the eye.  Single white man.  Open the eye.  There's nothing wrong with it.  You have nothing on your eye.  I swear to you there's something wrong with my eye.  There's nothing on your forehead.  You had a huge patch.  There's nothing on your eye.  You're saying you couldn't even take the patch off the shower. 
[00:51:00]  There's nothing on your forehead.  Holy S.  That is the best.  Now, look.  All right.  It's opening up.  Yeah, it's opening up a little bit.  All right.  I swear if you guys.  It's opening.  Yes.  All right.  Open it up.  You embellished about the eye.  Open it.  No.  Pull the bottom lid down a little.  That really does hurt.  Well, pull it down.  I just want to see if it's red.  Pull the bottom lid down.  Now, open your eye.  I can't open up my eye.  Hold it open.  That really does hurt.  Take the pain.  Hold it open a little.  Hold your eye open.  I want to see if there's any irritate. 
[00:51:30]  Look, it's totally white.  Dude, do you see any red?  I swear it hurts.  It looks like his other eye.  There's no red.  There's nothing wrong with you.  I mean, they're a little bloodshot, but his other eye's bloodshot, too.  There's nothing wrong with you.  They're both the same.  But please wear the patch.  Feel free to wear the patch.  With my parrot.  Please feel free to wear the patch.  All right.  Look at Hope.  He's freaking out on me.  Hey, in one second. 
[00:52:00]  Who the hell screams these people?  Not always.  What's up, bud, Ben?  Brian is a little weird.  Do you remember the first couple days you showed up to work?  You, like, brought in pies and was buying us coffee.  Well, that's nice.  You want to make a good impression.  I'm not going to delve off into any other direction.  There are directions here that don't have any validity with this case that we're working on right here.  The injury case.  The injury case.  I still got to know.  Did you embellish with the motorcycle?  No.  I have the police report.  I will bring it in.  All right. 
[00:52:30]  We are looking forward to seeing the police report.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much for the frigging half-hour radio.  Steve, you're not going home early today, are you?  No.  Not at all.  Steve, we've got to get at least a still picture of the unveiling of the police.  Okay.  What were you working on before we pulled you in?  Nothing.  Nothing?  I'm checking out his feedback.  All right.  Okay. 
[00:53:00]  Great.  We'll let you continue ahead on your job.  All right.  You can wear the patch if your eyes are hurting a little bit.  All right?  Okay.  Thank you very much.  That was great.  Take your bandage with you.  We wouldn't want to get any infections from all the blood on there.  That is great.  What's the matter?  Nothing.  I'm a little hurt.  You're a little hurt?  I feel like an ass.  Yeah.  Well, you know something?  Well, open your eye.  And then we can, like, move on.  And you're still, like, faking that you can't open the eye.  The thing is, I understand you feel like an ass.  But when you do certain things and they don't pan out and there's consequences, the one consequence is looking like an ass. 
[00:53:30]  Yes.  So you did this.  Now you move on and you learn.  That may be embellishing when these things happen.  You said you had stitches.  There's nothing on your forehead.  Nothing at all.  Next time you fake a knee injury, you wrap it up in an ace bandage, no one could call you on it.  You just say, it hurt.  I hurt my leg.  But a head wound is like, wow, that's a tough one because it's right there.  And the patch, you know something?  If you're just a head wound, maybe that would have it.  But then you add the patch, it's a little much. 
[00:54:00]  Okay.  A little much.  We might have believed it if you just had the patch.  Or the eye patch.  Not both, though.  It's a bolt.  Put it over the top.  But next time a leg injury, back injury, something you can't really, say, take the bandage off.  Jay, dude, stop talking to this guy.  Call security.  Hide behind something.  You'll never see a freaking accident report.  He's lying.  He's a psycho, bro.  All right?  Thank you.  Now, wait, wait, wait.  He says he feels like an ace. 
[00:54:30]  That's because he's busted.  Now he's about to strike.  You're not going to strike, are you?  I have my hands.  I feel like it's an eye.  Can we check his clothes and stuff?  For real?  You're not going to go crazy, are you?  No, he is, man.  Get rid of him.  Do you own any guns?  No guns.  Do you have any guns on you?  No.  Do you have any needles in your pocket?  Okay, let's brisk them over.  I'm not going to get stuck in here, am I?  Can we check his clothes for weapons?  I don't think he's carrying any weapons, Opie.  You thought he had stitches. 
[00:55:00]  No, we didn't think he had stitches.  But, you know, I would think he was just trying to garner a little sympathy.  Are you the man of a thousand faces?  Excuse for the day off.  All right, we can move on now.  All right.  Thank you very much.  You can go back to or whatever.  And don't feel too bad, you know.  You pay, you know.  You do something.  It doesn't pan out.  You pay.  Now you'll forever be the eye patch.  What good message board name could it be? 
[00:55:30]  Captain Psycho.  Captain Psycho.  I'm honored.  All right.  All right.  Well, continue with looking at instant feedbacks.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You can turn around and...  There you go.  There you go.  There he goes.  Out the door.  Watch, don't hit your head with the door.  That would hurt.  Lock that studio door.  Holy S.  Where the hell are you firing these people?  That was great.  Opie.  Keep your hands. 
[00:56:00]  Always see your pants.  Ah, too late.  And Anthony.  I'm just a flaming fag.  More stupidity on the way.  102.7 WNW.  Yeah, it's the O&A show.  212-757-1027.  You know, you got to get Stinky in here.  I'm proud of Stink.  He's becoming more and more honest as he continues working on our radio show.  He was...  Stinky was a little, uh... 
[00:56:30]  What, shy?  Shy at first.  Wouldn't really speak his mind, but...  He has changed.  Stink?  One of our favorite smartasses back in the office after the show.  Stinky.  Stink, what are you feeling right now with this kid?  I hate him.  I don't want to see him.  Oh, wow.  He lied to me, like, constantly the whole day before the show.  Really?  I was asking him, you know, what happened.  Oh, I got stitches.  I can't show them.  My eyes got glass in it.  Like, you know, what am I going to do?  A little scary.  And you're a little, like, uncomfortable now. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, I don't want to talk to him.  So you guys are like, I'm uncomfortable.  Yeah, you got to be a little sympathetic, Opie.  I mean, there's a reason that he's doing this, you know.  I'm not out here to save the world and stuff, but I kind of know there's some kind of reason that it's going on.  Anthony.  Yeah.  There was a reason why Joel Rifkin did what he did.  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm saying I'm not, uh...  I'm not getting behind him.  There was a reason why that kid shot up the school in San Diego. 
[00:57:30]  Absolutely.  And it was because when he lied one time or something, people just jumped on him, maybe.  Yeah.  People are tuning in halfway through going, what the hell is going on?  It went from an A-team type crash.  Why don't you explain really fast?  Summarize.  I know.  Summarize what happened.  Well, Opie, our intern came in today.  Yeah, he...  What's his name?  Brian.  This is Brian.  He came in.  He had a big bandage on his forehead.  Huge. 
[00:58:00]  Huge.  Yeah, very big bandage.  Took up half his forehead.  On his forehead.  And an eye patch over the left eye, his left eye.  Claiming he had it in an accident with a car and a motorcycle.  He was making a left.  So he went out to get coffee or something, and we all started whispering to the back  office.  We're like, holy yes, the guy's faking.  It just didn't seem...  Didn't add up.  Didn't add up.  He was trying to get off of work, I think, or an excuse for not coming in. 
[00:58:30]  Because he didn't show up Wednesday.  Is that it, Rick?  Didn't show up Monday or Wednesday.  Didn't hear from him at all.  Yeah.  So basically...  And Rick's just a prick to work for.  So he, like, really rags these guys.  Basically, he should be fired, but he had an excuse.  And the excuse was that he was in this accident.  Yeah.  Hence, the patch on his eye and the big, huge bandage on the forehead.  And the big bandage on his head.  And people were calling him on it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In the office.  We were talking.  And then we decided we'd just go on the air and hash it out.  Well, he comes in and says...  He was making a left. 
[00:59:00]  The motorcycle was going straight around him.  They crashed.  His head went through the driver's side window, cutting his head, requiring three stitches  in the ER, Opie.  And he had glass in his eye, which scratched the cornea.  And that's what the eye patch was there.  After some questioning about some things that didn't quite pan out...  Everyone is scared now.  Look at everyone's face.  Might have been embellishing.  No, let's go outside.  Everyone's in the studio.  He might have been embellishing.  He's the only one outside the studio now. 
[00:59:30]  And that door's locked.  Freaked out.  So we said he might have been embellishing the story.  Who comes up with this crap?  He wouldn't take the bandage off his eye, off his head, off his forehead.  He wouldn't take the bandage off.  We wanted to see the cuss.  He finally said he was embellishing.  Took the bandage off.  Opie, there was not even a ding.  There wasn't a scratch where if you scratched yourself on your head because you had an itch,  there wasn't even that red that you had.  I have more of a mark on my face, you probably noticed today, 
[01:00:00]  from a washcloth because I scrubbed too hard.  Look, over here.  Right.  He doesn't even have that on his forehead.  You get more marks just from shaving than you have.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't stress to how much of a mark there was nothing.  Nothing.  And then the eye patch comes off.  He was blinking real hard with that eye,  saying that there was glass in it,  even though there wasn't glass.  But the eye started loosening up,  and he's not blinking as glass.  And he pulled down the bottom of the eye,  and there was no red at all. 
[01:00:30]  No red in the eye.  So, obviously...  So it went from a major car accident to...  He made up the story because he missed Monday and Wednesday,  and now no one wants to leave the studio to work.  It was a story.  Let's go back to Anne-Marie.  Anne-Marie.  Yes.  Hey.  How you doing?  All right.  Well, I can tell you that Brian probably,  when he gets hurt,  see what happens is,  he's kind of afraid that it's going to be worse than it really is. 
[01:01:00]  Anne-Marie, he wasn't hurt at all.  Oh, but I bet you he thinks he was.  I wouldn't put it past him.  I bet you he poked himself in the eye a couple times  before he came to work.  No, he didn't do it on purpose.  But he gets, like, he's very tender.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Like, if he gets, like, a headache, you know,  he's got a brain tumor, it's, you know...  Oh, like a hypochondriac kind of thing?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What's...  Yeah.  But that's...  Yeah, and we call him Briar the Liar. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, what do you call him?  Briar the Liar.  Well, because he exaggerates a lot?  A little bit, yeah.  Jesse?  Yeah.  Do you remember when he said he had to take a day off  because he had surgery on his head or his brain?  No, it was his foot.  What?  What?  It's something like that.  It's his foot.  It was his foot?  Yeah.  Oh, he said his brain.  You're right.  He said he had surgery on his head.  Well, maybe his head is...  All right, let's go.  Get Briar.  Briar, what happened?  What happened when?  You had surgery.  On my ankle, yes.  On your ankle.  Yes, that was true.  And that was true. 
[01:02:00]  What happened then?  Now nothing I'm going to say.  Well, now you know what it is.  It's the boy that cried wolf thing.  You can't blame us now for not believing certain things.  Earl, stay in here.  Steve, stay in here.  Get sticky in here.  Now, what happened to your leg?  To your ankle?  From my leg, I tore a leg.  What happened?  I tore my leg and it's playing basketball.  Playing basketball.  And you got an operation done.  It doesn't look like you're too active.  Do you have a scar on your ankle?  Is there an operation scar there?  Yeah.  On my knee, yeah.  All right, let's see.  He was playing basketball with Michael Jordan. 
[01:02:30]  Brian, you...  All right.  Brian, you told me it was when you tripped.  I thought you said ankle.  I thought you just said ankle.  Wait, I thought you just said ankle.  You said ankle.  I'm just...  All right.  I don't see any surgical scars.  Wait, where's the scar?  How long ago was this done?  My surgery scar was done a while ago.  But my knee...  But what's the recent one?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Guys, when was this?  When was this?  This was a couple weeks ago.  Do you remember when you guys made a quick comment that someone tripped over the door? 
[01:03:00]  Right.  He tripped over the...  Oh, that was Brian.  I remember that.  And you said you came in and you said you had to have, like, your ankle...  You, like, tore a ligament or something.  I didn't tore a ligament from that.  I don't need to be writing you out.  You want to see my...  I'm not trying to write it out of me.  Where is the surgery scar that you had from this recent operation that was two weeks ago?  It was orthoscopic.  You're not familiar to see it.  I swear.  Oh, no.  We have no surgery scars over here.  Wait a minute.  It was orthoscopic. 
[01:03:30]  So...  Okay.  What do you got?  It's a mole.  It's a mole.  It's a mole?  Oh, my God.  I can't believe it.  It's not a mole.  Okay.  Now, Brian, haven't you also been going to physical therapy every Friday?  Yes.  I have been.  For what?  My ankle.  For the ankle.  Yeah.  That you had the orthoscopic surgery.  You had the mole on.  Yes.  And this therapy is where? 
[01:04:00]  It's in Peekskill.  Sorry.  Pleasantville again.  No, Peekskill.  And what do they do to help you out?  Put me on different machines.  Although I'm not very active, as Opie said.  They put me on machines that make me.  On machines?  Yes.  Because your ankle, what do they say is actually wrong?  It's total ligaments.  It's total ligaments.  Yes, a lot of them.  So now you, like, walk and do things, treadmill or something.  Treadmill, they put me on different machines.  Okay.  But there's no scar?  No.  It's amazing. 
[01:04:30]  It's new, sir.  All right.  Where's...  Bring Jesse in here.  Pathological Brian's a new nickname.  Mark from LeBron.  Get everyone in here.  Get Stinky in here.  So, okay, you had that surgery.  Yeah.  But it was nothing with your brain or your head?  What was that, Jess?  You said...  See, Ben, I don't remember exactly, because it wasn't, like, a big deal.  But you said you couldn't come in one Friday.  I don't mean...  I feel bad, because I'm like... 
[01:05:00]  Oh, whatever.  That's cool.  You said you had, like...  You needed surgery on your head.  On your head?  No, no.  That was Rick making a joke about head surgery.  I never said I had head surgery.  I think we're going to have a little vote.  What are you going to vote?  Who wants Brian to go home today?  What?  I'm not voting that.  You lied.  Why were face?  Who cares?  I'm fine with it.  I don't care.  I think it makes for a great radio.  What, you want to toss a diamond in the rump like this out the door?  No, I said go home today. 
[01:05:30]  Today?  Yeah.  No.  I think he's doing a great job.  Thank you, I think.  Come on.  You're going to get more stories if we live.  This is great.  If we live.  Hands up.  Who wants him out?  Today.  Today?  No.  I think I'll put my hand up, too.  Oh, you want to go home today?  Steve?  Take care of the eye?  I'm cold as I'm cold.  You're cold.  Well, you're big.  And you don't know how to handle yourself.  I don't know.  You're going to hate things, Steve.  He's not going to.  There's only three people that want him to leave?  I don't know if you're being honest.  Let's be honest. 
[01:06:00]  Why don't we get out of the room?  I'm being honest.  I think it's fine.  I'll turn my back, and I'll put my hands against the wall for you guys.  All right.  Turn your back, because maybe someone doesn't want to see that they're voting for you.  Oh, a secret ballot?  All right.  Who wants him to leave?  Yeah, look.  Four votes are going up right now.  Four and four.  I had mine up before.  I just didn't see it.  Earl?  It's to you.  The deciding vote.  Earl?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  No way.  The man that can't do anything right.  Earl's not going to vote him off the island.  That's his brother, man. 
[01:06:30]  Earl still thinks he's a virgin.  Earl, I like you.  I can't believe you guys wanted to stay today.  I want you to vote me out.  Kids effed up.  Why did you do it?  Can we ask that?  We really have an answer to ask the why.  Why did you go through this elaborate accident scheme?  Intimidation.  What do you mean?  Everyone had a story on the show, and you figured you needed one?  Yeah, sure.  No, not as much.  What intimidation?  Wait, you are intimidated, or you are? 
[01:07:00]  I'm intimidated by this show.  You're intimidated.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Before you get into this.  Yeah.  Because it is a tie.  It's four that want him to go, four that want him to stay.  I'm telling you, we're going to the listeners.  I'm sorry.  I'm screwed.  Clear the phone lines.  One, two, three, four, five, six, two, four.  Okay, we got nine phones ringing.  And that's what's going to decide it.  I still got a note.  Was there ever an accident?  Yes, there was.  Was it in the last calendar year?  Yes, it was.  See, now I can't even believe that.  I can't. 
[01:07:30]  Now I can't believe it.  But when I bring in the accident report, I'll wind up.  And I interrupted you.  Go ahead.  Say what you have to say.  You were saying you were getting...  Oh, you're intimidated by the show.  Yes.  Now, why is...  I'm sure anybody...  Jess, when you first came here, it was a little rough, a little intimidating.  Yeah.  All right.  And how did you deal with it?  I'm still dealing with it.  What are you guys talking about?  But you just come in, you do your job, you hang out, you get your barbs in where you can,  you kind of, you mix it up with us.  No, like, you just don't say any...  I would wait until you guys would talk to me, and I didn't bring food. 
[01:08:00]  Okay.  But that...  But that was a nice gesture.  No, that was a nice gesture.  That was a nice gesture.  But, now, how did you feel this was going to help you?  Because I felt like if I didn't come up with...  Because if I didn't elaborate on my injuries, you guys wouldn't believe me, which...  Well, yeah, you put you over the top there.  But why did you come up with the story at all?  It wasn't a story.  It really...  I mean, what?  But, oh, it's a story.  You don't have stitches.  Okay, that one is a story, but the accident was true. 
[01:08:30]  Take the patch off.  Take the patch off.  Take the patch off.  Take the patch off.  Take the patch off.  Take the patch off.  God.  I'm not going to play along now.  Take the patch off.  My eye really does bother me.  I really can't take off a patch.  His eye bothers him, Opie.  You guys are all insane.  Don't.  I know.  Cornea, if you shine a light in the person's eye, it kills.  Yeah.  You don't want to do that, do you?  We're not shining a light in his eye, for Christ.  We're starting the voting.  Okay?  The listeners will decide.  I'm packing up as we speak. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, Dave.  Yeah.  Have you heard the last hour of radio?  Yeah.  Okay.  What do you think?  I think the guy's a pathological liar.  I think you've got to get rid of him.  All right.  Get rid of him.  All right.  Thank you, Dave.  Take care.  This is one bell.  Stinky.  Make sure Stinky keeps track.  Okay.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike?  Mike?  I don't know, man.  This guy's crazy, but he's funny.  So, no.  That's what I'm saying.  All we want to know is, should we, you know, send him home today?  Right now?  No.  No. 
[01:09:30]  This is way entertaining, man.  I'm listening.  All right.  Stay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let's go to another Mike.  Mike?  Uh, keep him there, because, uh, two words.  Ted Kaczynski.  Thank you, Mike.  All right.  Have you been known to be violent at any time?  I'm a very sweet guy.  Very sweet.  And he's a liar, so that might mean...  So they said about Joel Rifkin.  No, and, and, and, so you don't have any aggression or anything?  You guys are insane.  Well, everyone says that one day I might just, you know, snap.  Oh, good.  Let's just keep him around. 
[01:10:00]  You're insane, Anthony.  And there's no gag anymore.  I can't believe you guys want him here after what we just heard.  Oh, wait.  Earl's raising his hand now.  Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because you were a pussy when we needed you.  So now the listeners are going to decide.  Troy.  Yeah.  Hey.  He's the guy, man.  See, everybody.  F you all.  Sympathy vote.  I love it.  F you all.  Let's go to, let's go to Jerry.  Jerry.  Fire him.  He's a fairy.  Fire him? 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, fairy.  He's a fairy.  Fire him.  All right.  Okay.  We're running out of votes here.  Let's go to Frank.  Frank.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, now I know why my instant feedback's never getting on the air anymore.  Fire his ass.  Fire his ass.  It's 3-3.  All right, guys.  Bye-bye.  Three votes to go.  Mark from the Bronx saying he should have used the Chewbacca defense quickly, that it's  just so ridiculous that you must have quit.  Jeremy.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey.  I say keep him.  I think you've got a status quo on our hands.  F and you guys suck. 
[01:11:00]  No, that was a keep.  Please, no, don't let him leave today.  It's only 5 o'clock.  That leaves in two hours to come back with weapons.  Michael.  Hey, what do you think?  I think he should go.  All right.  He's like the guy at the ski lodge with the fake cast.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  It comes down to the one final vote.  Here it is.  Don't let me down.  Wayne?  Yeah, that's me.  All right.  How you doing, O.D.?  You will decide Brian's fate.  Fate.  Honestly, I know his doctor before I vote. 
[01:11:30]  What?  I know his doctor.  You knew his doctor?  I know his doctor.  I can verify for it all.  Conflict of interest on the voting, but.  Oh, but it's Bones McCoy.  Bones McCoy.  Wayne's double.  Bones McCoy.  There's anything that's wrong with him before he comes into work.  All right.  Everybody.  Very funny.  You just saved your ass.  All right.  Wayne, it's Steve.  I say keep the nut.  You.  Keep the nut.  You know, maybe put one of those security bracelets on him so you know where he is all  the time.  Will I take off my patch now?  He stays. 
[01:12:00]  Keep on your patch?  I mean, you got to talk about it, you know, pull around.  So now you're going to admit that the patch is fake and you want to take it off now?  No, that was a joke.  I'm sorry.  Wayne, thank you.  You let me down and I was going to give you something for voting him out.  You're going to give me something to vote him out?  No, no, I can't.  You voted to keep him.  Brian, I'd appreciate it if you didn't look me in the eye or even don't even come 20 feet  away from me.  Don't even enter the studio for the rest of the show. 
[01:12:30]  Okay.  Just the show?  Okay.  I can do that.  And do not be in the office after the show's over.  Uh-oh.  Until I leave for the train.  It's like Michael Corleone and Fredo.  You're nuts.  Look at me.  You're dead to me.  Wow.  I'm going to slowly back out of the studio now.  This is, uh, you guys let me down, man.  What's the matter, O?  You don't like me?  You're saying you love the Psycho Factor.  Every time something happens, you go, I love the Psycho Factor.  We just got an hour of Psycho Factor. 
[01:13:00]  Now it's like hit the street.  Oh.  What?  There he comes.  What?  Come on.  What?  You don't find this very entertaining on a very psychotic level?  You don't have to deal with them.  Look at these guys.  Look at Sticky and Jess.  They don't even want to go outside the studio now.  I'm never going to talk to them again.  You're the talent, guys.  You know?  You're not the talent.  No, the problem is, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  I wanted him to go.  Ain't one mistake. 
[01:13:30]  Then we went to all you guys.  It was four and four.  Then we go to the listeners.  And the listeners let us down.  Or my side, anyway.  I saw your point.  Ben, are you happy?  No.  This sucks.  Get him out.  You're a friggin' freak.  Thank you.  That is mental.  That whole story we just heard is beyond psycho factor.  That's mental.  All right.  Send him home for the day.  We can't.  And then we will talk about it.  No, we can't.  Why?  We did it the fair way. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, I know we did it the fair way.  I'll accept the results.  I'm just pissed.  I'm pissed at the results, but I'll accept them.  Well, the voting should be whether he should be fired or not.  We don't need good radio that bad, is all I'm going to say.  Look at this guy checking in.  Make him wear the patch as long as he still works there, no matter how long it is.  He's always got to come in now with that patch.  If he doesn't, he goes home.  Yeah, tell him that.  No, I'm serious.  He's got to wear the patch always.  No, the day he shows up without the patch, I swear to God, you've got to send him right home. 
[01:14:30]  No joke.  Rick, go tell him.  No, that's got to come from Rick.  Rick hired the lunatic.  Very good.  Michael from Kenton Falls.  He said that.  Tony, what's up?  Oh, before you start ripping on me, I agree you should have sent him home today.  I tried.  But, dude, this kid has got problems, bro.  And, dude, we've listened to your stories about your family.  Yeah.  Dude, my friend's pregnant wife works with your brother, Quinn.  You think after hearing Friday's show, she didn't look at him in a different way? 
[01:15:00]  Wait a minute.  First of all, first of all.  Dude, I agree, bro.  I've never faked an injury.  I know you have.  No one in my family faked an injury for sympathy.  All right?  Bro, nobody's questioning your integrity, bro.  But this kid has got problems.  He needs a nap ski.  Maybe a permanent one.  Oh, thank you, Tony.  Not you, Ope.  The kid.  Oh, I heard you.  Dude, man. 
[01:15:30]  I don't know, Ope.  Nice knowing you, bro.  This kid's going to whack you and stinky first.  Jeez.  Later, dude.  All right, Tony.  Nice knowing you, brother.  Uh, Tuttle from New York.  Final test.  Does Brian like Huey Lewis and the news?  Look at my business card.  The color is bone.  Rob, what's going on?  Yo, fire his dumb ass.  You're calling stinky a rat, though.  No, because I thought the kid was answering the phone.  Oh.  Dude, stinky rocks, man.  Stinky rolls.  Yeah.  They should make you just headless.  I'm stinky's personal bitch. 
[01:16:00]  All right.  They can do stupid things.  All right.  All right, guys.  Thank you, Rob.  All right.  Look, Steve, you're all uncomfortable.  No, this isn't going to work.  He's got to go home today.  Oh, because...  No, because, like, Michael...  Here, Michael...  Now you're all uncomfortable.  Michael online, too.  Ope, change your diaper.  Opey.  Yeah.  What's your problem?  We're a grown man.  We're not...  Because the kid is effed up.  Opey.  Not even in a good way.  Not even in a way we could, like, exploit on the radio.  Who cares?  You could take him down. 
[01:16:30]  All right?  I saw you on XFL.  I mean, you're not some little small wimp.  Who cares?  He's not going to shoot anybody.  He doesn't know how to bandage himself.  So what?  See, now Ann wants to send him home.  But you know what?  Ann, stick to your word.  Keep him.  He's entertaining.  I'm just saying, if it's going to interfere with the show, then he's got to go home.  No, see, I'm not happy with the decision we made, but we made the decision.  I have to live with that.  Yeah, but you're...  That's fine.  Yeah, but you're crying about it.  Who cares?  Michael...  Keep him away!  Michael, you...  Stinky! 
[01:17:00]  God, someone will back me up.  Stinky, talk to Michael.  Everyone is uncomfortable now.  How are you going to look at this guy or, like, at the end of the show, go to the office  and sit down next to him?  What is he going to say to you?  Michael, the guy had a bandage on his forehead, claiming he had three stitches.  After about an hour, he finally took the bandage off.  Guess what?  There wasn't even a scratch.  Isn't that a little mental?  Did he have a Jeffrey Dahmer look to him, or what?  At least out of one eye, did you see it?  I mean, come on.  You're sitting here whining about this for 20 minutes.  Move on.  All right, we'll move on, please. 
[01:17:30]  Thank you.  Okay.  If I was him, I would leave on my own, out of embarrassment.  I don't know what he's doing.  No, he's just sitting there.  No one's talking to him.  He's afraid to come by the studio door, even.  Hey, tell him to go home.  What?  Tell him to go home.  Oh, you're not going to make me do that.  Oh, I will, but then the listeners will lash out at me.  Call me and cry, baby.  If it comes from you, they'll go, okay, cool. 
[01:18:00]  Tell him to go home.  I can't do that.  What am I?  Tell him to go home.  Tell him to go home and not to go back.  Now, get out of here.  Come on.  That's not my job.  I don't hire and fire.  Well, that's Rick's job.  Rick should show some backbone.  Oh, see?  Come on.  You're pushing it off onto me.  Well, who's who's?  Hey, the name on the sign says Opie and Anthony, and you're Anthony.  Look.  Yeah, his name's first. 
[01:18:30]  Look.  You're going to pull that.  That's the first time you ever pulled out.  In this situation.  It works.  Just for the record, we've never played that before.  It works, though, in this situation.  You know we've never played that before.  Look, I already spelt out how I feel about this.  Look, if I'm not looked at as a crybaby, I'll do it right now.  No problem.  Oh, I can't see.  I think, what are you thinking?  He's having a bone.  What are you going to do anyway? 
[01:19:00]  He can't do anything now.  He just has to sit there.  You know what?  I don't really care what people think of me.  Get him in here.  Yeah, make sure he doesn't go in the studio.  Brian.  Yeah.  You're outside the studio about what?  He said 20 feet from you.  Right.  That's what I asked you.  So, for the first time, you're following rules.  The Opie restraining order.  Can we do the prison visit, though?  Yeah, you want to do it that way?  Yeah, get him on the phone.  All right.  No, because then, no.  No, I can do it this way. 
[01:19:30]  Brian, you're making a lot of people uncomfortable.  I can tell.  I'll leave if you want me to.  That's okay.  I understand.  What?  What?  I understand.  You understand that?  Yeah.  We don't know if we want you back, though.  What?  I'm going to lie?  That would suck.  Well.  Do you understand there has been a breach of faith here?  Don't you find it a little weird, the whole thing?  You're still wearing the patch, and you don't even have an eye injury.  You don't have an injury, though.  That's what you don't understand.  What's every injury? 
[01:20:00]  You said you had an injury on your forehead.  There's not even a scratch.  My head was smashed apart, and I lost my shoes.  So, you're about 19 feet away.  Okay.  Yeah, move back a quick.  Thank you.  God damn it.  You're awful.  You're so mean.  I'm mean.  The guy's getting the suit.  Shut up.  No, I see what you're talking about.  Shut up, Jess.  I don't have a job.  Obi, you're 100% right.  Stank, am I right?  You are.  Ben, am I right? 
[01:20:30]  100%.  Thank you.  200%.  You're not going to ask me?  I don't care.  I know you don't care.  That's all right.  These are good cookies.  Who wants them to come back?  Not everyone at once.  Wow.  That hurts.  How's it going to be different any day, you know, tomorrow?  It's awkward.  Yeah, you're calling sick.  Is the injury going to be healed?  You're calling sick half the time anyway.  Is this going to crush you? 
[01:21:00]  Not that much, but it will.  A little bit, because I like you guys.  No.  You can still, you can still, you can still, you can still, I mean, be tough, be tough.  I'm talking to myself.  Would we have to worry about you coming back here and shooting everybody?  I don't like being blunt with this thing.  Now, is there anything that might happen?  Are you going to shoot everyone?  No, no, no.  No shooting going on.  Stab?  No.  You can still listen to us through the radio and stuff.  Let's see how things go. 
[01:21:30]  Can you step back a little bit?  Hello, I think he sounds fine to me.  I don't foresee any problems with him coming back.  So, Brian, why don't you, you know.  You're not going to kill anybody, though, right?  No, nobody's going to be dead.  No threats, no threatening emails or anything?  Nothing at all.  What?  Nothing at all.  Nothing at all.  Brian, did you sign something?  Yeah.  When you started working here?  Yeah.  Okay.  That you're not to kill anybody?  Yeah, I didn't read the fine print, but I guess... 
[01:22:00]  I think that was in there.  Brian, I'd feel safer if you weren't around.  You know, it comes from this breach in faith.  We all trust each other here, and we don't lie to each other.  And then when a lie is made like that, we're like, hey, where does it end?  You know what I mean?  Okay.  Oh, I'm the guy.  You just made me the guy.  I just said that.  I've gotten that speech before.  Oh, no, you be the guy.  I'm going to go back to my cookies.  I'm okay.  And beer.  Hang out.  Cookies and beer.  I'm fine.  We'll leave the door, Jar, and we'll revisit this. 
[01:22:30]  You're not fired.  You're on what we call a permanent layoff.  Oh, I've been laid off.  All right, Rick, why don't you show Brian the door?  Oh.  What?  Jess?  I'm terrible.  No, you guys are right, the way I think about it.  He's all right?  No, you guys are right, the way I think about it.  Why?  What were you thinking before?  I just felt like it was, like, mean.  Yeah, I mean, I, see, that's what I'm here, but I mean.  Look, I'm kind of elaborate just to, you know.  Yeah, but we don't, and I, and I don't have to, we don't work with him. 
[01:23:00]  It's someone like Stink.  I can see it in his face.  He's not happy.  Ben's not happy.  You're not happy.  I'm not happy.  Rick's not happy.  Yeah, I see.  That's what I mean.  I see the point.  You don't have enough brain cells to figure out that the guy's a psychopath.  Right.  You're working with him thinking everything's fine.  Brian, any final thoughts?  Oh.  Oh, God.  Yeah, you want to make a statement? 
[01:23:30]  It's been real.  Do you feel this is justified?  Somewhat.  If I brought in the police report, would you guys still sit on BF?  Oh.  Well, I have a problem with the stitches that weren't there.  Yeah, even if you are in some kind of an accident, like the stitches not being there  is a little weird.  Okay.  Not only that, if you really had an accident, then fine.  Call us and say you had an accident.  But don't not call us or call other people in this building and then show up the next  day that you're supposed to be here to work with an eye patch, a captain's hook hand, 
[01:24:00]  a freaking bandage on your head.  A parrot.  I'm surprised you didn't wipe off your own leg just so you can limp in here.  Christ's sake.  All right.  Well, we've got to take a break, Brian.  So, thank you.  Well, you know something.  What?  Send him home today.  And then let's really discuss this because...  No.  No.  You know what it is.  Come on.  Have a little, you know, compassion.  I have compassion.  I just...  I feel bad somewhere inside.  How old a guy are you?  What?  He's 20.  You didn't F up?  Tell a few wacky stories when you were 20? 
[01:24:30]  But I F'd up so many times and Rick's been a lot cooler than that.  You didn't come in with a fake injury.  That's what I mean.  I'm on your side.  What I'm saying, Rick's easy to go to when you screw up.  That's a single white female territory.  It's weird if I could figure out why you did it.  I really still don't understand why you would do it.  Is there some kind of an issue you got?  Are there other issues?  It's hard to scream across the studio, but it's a matter of being really afraid of you  guys and being intimidated.  You're 19 feet away. 
[01:25:00]  Is it an attention thing?  No.  You don't crave attention?  No.  Maybe?  No?  No.  Dude, you look ridiculous.  You're standing there with an eye patch that you probably don't need.  Oh, probably.  He's warming up to you.  All right.  We've got to move on with the show.  Okay, so look, you go home for the rest of the day because he can't think under these  circumstances.  And we'll get back to you on the long term of this.  Sure.  I just want to see it.  All right.  That's all.  It's just letting you off the hook lightly. 
[01:25:30]  No, I'm not.  I'm really interested to see if I'm out.  You'll get the phone call tomorrow.  Oh, okay.  Look at the act.  Oh.  I'm expecting it to you.  I don't care.  I want to see it.  That's all.  All right, Rick.  Thank you, Brian.  Thank you, Brian, for your service to this fine radio show.  Let's take a break, regroup, and do something different.  You've got all the tact of a rake.  I like, I like, I like small boys. 
[01:26:00]  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  You are officially out of control.  Agreed.  1027.  N.E.W.  1027 W.N.E.W. is...  The Sports Guys at 5 a.m.  The Radio Chick at 9.  Ron and Fez at noon.  O.B. and Anthony at 3.  Don and Mike at 7.  Next time, on a very special Ron and Fez.  We're looking for the ultimate New Yorker.  It's your chance to win $10,000. 
[01:26:30]  Ronnie, it says here that Carnegie Hall seats over 2,800 people.  Yeah, but only 2,500 if you're there.  Hey!  Fez, can you honestly tell me that that fat ass of yours doesn't make up 300 seats?  No.  Then I guess your 300 seat ass owes me an apology.  Sorry.  Listen for details on how you can become the ultimate New Yorker on Ron and Fez.  And win $10,000 from Ron and Fez.  Now in midday.  Ron and Fez.  Middays, noon to 3.  1027.  W.N.E.W.  Um, yeah, it's the O&A show. 
[01:27:00]  Lots to do today.  We'll get into all that in just a bit here.  You know what?  I have a conspiracy theory that rivals anything from the X-Files.  Hi, Anthony, before you start this?  Yeah.  Uh, 405 update.  Ken Stevens still out for lunch.  Check him for body glitter when he gets back.  Here's my theory.  Rivals the X-Files conspiracies.  Uh, every woman in, uh, at least this country got together somehow on a secret woman network. 
[01:27:30]  I think it's over the internet.  Some...  Can you find that on the WWW thing?  On that WWW thing?  I don't know where it is.  Guys can't access this.  It's a code that they've all spread around and kept very secret.  And there was this huge invention called body glitter.  Came out a few years back.  This stuff is like when, when they used to tag the animals on Wild Kingdom.  Because you, if you ever come home with body glitter on you, there is no effing way you can make an excuse for it. 
[01:28:00]  You were in contact with a woman wearing body glitter in some way, shape, or form.  How you handle that contact is another thing.  How you get out of that.  But there's no saying, I did not have contact with a woman that had body glitter on you.  There's got to be other ways to get body glitter on you.  Let me think.  A body glitter truck exploded right next to me.  Holy Christ, I'm lucky to be alive. 
[01:28:30]  You come home with body glitter.  There's no doubt what you were up to.  You've got to have, no, I'm not even saying you were doing anything.  But the fact is, now your excuse isn't going to be, no, no one was near me with body glitter.  No one touched me with body glitter.  Now you have to come up with an excuse as to why you have it on you.  And the only thing is, a girl touched you with body glitter on.  You can do these strip clubs.  You used to just have to worry about horse smell.  That perfume sweat thing that they wear so well. 
[01:29:00]  And portions of that, of course, you know, can be washed off.  You can never wash off body glitter entirely.  You could do whatever you want.  There will still be, all of a sudden you're walking in the kitchen or somewhere.  You're getting yourself a drink.  You turn just right in that light.  Bling.  Bling.  Bling, bling.  A lighthouse effect of body glitter shines in our eyes.  What?  What's that?  So you think it's a conspiracy. 
[01:29:30]  The women have figured out a way now.  To track us.  To tag us.  When you're around alien women with this body glitter.  Just a fair warning.  Just giving it out there.  That's all.  Lisa has a story.  Lisa.  Hey, Lisa.  Oh, I am actually cold.  What?  What?  I feel cold because this is so scary.  Why?  My boyfriend came home with glitter Saturday night and I was suspicious.  And you're just making me crazy right now. 
[01:30:00]  I'm going to...  Oh, my God.  What did he say?  Ann, I hope you're not ruining it for all the men.  Dude, how could this ruin anything if you come home with body glitter?  They're all pissed at us now.  Mike, why are you getting us men in trouble with this?  How do you come home with body glitter?  And I'm not exposing anything other than if you come home with body glitter.  But maybe the fine ladies that listen to our show weren't thinking that until you put it in their heads.  See?  Lisa.  All right.  Lisa, what did you think and what did he say when you noticed body glitter on him?  Oh, he told me his sister had borrowed his car. 
[01:30:30]  Okay.  Oh, my God.  You're going to make me cry.  That's a hot one.  That's a hot one.  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  Maybe he was smelling extra fresh, too, and I thought I was suspicious.  This is so part of the car.  See?  You have to come up with some excuse.  You know, it was in his hair, too.  He has a little teaser. 
[01:31:00]  And I saw it when I got up in the morning.  I saw it in his hair.  Now, for you guys that are pissed at me for saying this, go F, because I'm helping your asses right now.  Because if this happens to you, you are going to need a story to run with.  So you think this out now.  Don't come up with your sister borrowed the car, either.  He said the sister, because we went for brunch the next morning.  I saw it in the passenger seat.  So his sister borrowed the car, and apparently, Accordance had picked up some of her girlfriends,  and maybe they had on body glitter. 
[01:31:30]  That is so lame.  I am freaking right now, because I blew it.  It's just a little nudge, but when you said it, I went cold.  Now we're having fun.  Were you buying that, though?  I actually was.  Yeah.  See, it's exactly what I said, though.  There's nothing.  You have to now come up with an excuse as to why you have it on.  It's not just going to get passed over. 
[01:32:00]  So I'm not letting any secrets out of the bag here.  All I'm saying is, if you go home with it, you're going to have to have a damn good excuse.  Because she's going to notice, and you're going to be F.  And it was on my skin, too.  Because when I got up in the morning, because I'm like one of those little bohemian chicks.  I don't wear any of that crap.  And I saw a little glitter on my skin.  I saw it in his hair.  See?  Can you see this?  That was the glitter from the whore that he was with.  Yes.  I'm helping you.  Look at that.  And I said to him, you don't smell of alcohol.  How about that? 
[01:32:30]  You know, he told me, and I actually believe this, that if you drink a lot of soda after  you drink alcohol, you don't smell it.  Because he was hanging with the boys.  Hanging with the boys with body glitter.  Was he hanging with the village people?  Fez.  Well, Lisa, keep us updated, okay?  Okay.  All right, cool.  All right.  Let's go to Chris.  What's going on?  Yeah, dude, I just got home two, three days ago.  And I see my girlfriend, all happy to see her.  She looks at me, she says, what's that? 
[01:33:00]  A little bit of glitter.  I was just at a party, you know, like a raver or whatever.  And, you know, all the raver kids, they always got body glitter going on, whatever.  I didn't notice.  And then she starts accusing me, oh, you're with some chick, blah, blah, blah.  Same old crap, man.  Chick sucks.  So you weren't doing anything?  You were just like at a rave?  No, no, no.  Like, all right.  This is the story, right?  All right.  So we take a couple of tabs, you know, little X, and we're dancing. 
[01:33:30]  Some of that X.  So I'm like hanging out with this chick.  She's cute.  And we're like dancing together.  Yeah.  So she gives me a little kiss on the cheek.  That's it.  That's all it takes, though.  That's fine.  But now you've got to say how you had contact with this girl.  Exactly.  And your wife's never going to believe that it was just a kiss.  It's a girl conspiracy thing.  Exactly.  That's what I'm saying.  All right.  Well, yeah, thanks, guys.  Whatever, Ben.  Well, big Randy checking in. 
[01:34:00]  Body glitter on your face.  Oh, so-and-so just gave me a kiss.  Body glitter on your C.  Start packing.  It's over.  Now, what if you get some on your hand, you go to take a leak, now you're spreading it  around like the AIDS.  Now, you try to come up with an excuse as to why you have body glitter on your genitals.  But I think you're start packing.  I think even if you have it on your hands, you're screwed, though.  Yeah.  And two, three days later, glitter's still there.  Ray? 
[01:34:30]  That doesn't all shower.  Ray?  Hey, Ray.  Yeah.  How are you doing?  You sound depressed.  I was so happy coming out of this go-go bar, you know, and I'm laughing at what you're  saying.  And I'm looking in the rear view mirror, and I said, oh, my God, it's all over my face.  See?  You went to the bar.  And now...  I did not know to look at this, you know?  And I'm looking in the rear, and I'm laughing at all the girls and all.  And I'm laughing, and I'm looking in the rear view mirror, and it makes, you know, the  lane changes.  And I'm looking in the mirror, and I said, oh, my God, my glasses, my face.  It's a tracking system. 
[01:35:00]  Imagine your chick coming home.  Look, imagine your girl comes home.  You go to give her a kiss, and you smell Old Spice on her neck.  Same thing.  You'd be like, how'd you get that?  Oh, well, so-and-so gave me a kiss.  Well, once that time when I came home, I had a little fishy smell.  I told her I went to McDonald's.  Oh, Jesus.  Thank you, Ray.  But, you know, the body glitter doesn't wash off.  It's not easy to find, and it just takes one piece to catch the light just right. 
[01:35:30]  It's over, Johnny.  Dylan.  Dylan.  Dylan.  Dylan.  Dana.  What's up, dude?  Dylan.  All right.  I think I have the solution to this problem.  All right.  You just have to wear the body glitter all the time.  Get your own body glitter.  But I don't give a f***.  Wow.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, sorry.  No cursing.  No F word.  Anyway, I don't give a f***.  It's like an arms race. 
[01:36:00]  If you know they're doing the glitter thing, you do the glitter thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then it, like, cancels each other out.  Cancels it out.  Yeah.  No, it was my mom.  She was wearing it.  Well, that's my advice.  All right.  Thank you.  Later.  Bye.  One more story here.  Butch.  Butch, what's up?  Hey.  What's up, man?  Yeah, I had the same problem.  I went to a club one night.  My friend's sister came up, gave me a hug, gave me a kiss on the cheek.  I didn't even realize she had the glitter on.  You know, I went home.  I was all exed out. 
[01:36:30]  And, you know, I walk in the door.  And the next day, you know, what the hell is that all over your face?  You know?  I was like, oh, it's my friend's sister.  You know, she gave me a kiss.  Those sisters.  What?  Those people and their sisters with the glitter.  Nah, you know, I was actually telling the truth.  I was like, oh, it's my friend's sister, you know, and I still got in trouble.  Of course.  You know?  Of course you did.  Oh, brother.  All right.  Thank you, Butch.  Who is Shem?  Shem?  Yeah.  What's up?  Hey, O&A.  How's it going? 
[01:37:00]  Hey.  I wonder if we can flip it on them.  If they come home with not enough body glitter, can we start freshen them?  Yeah, right.  Where did your body glitter go?  It's like you're rubbing off.  There's not enough glitter on her face, not enough on her shirt, on her skirt.  You can start ranking on them.  Marking territory.  Yeah, exactly.  That's funny.  Thanks.  Pete from Teanex says, the glitter's like the exploding packs of money from the bank.  You know, you go to rob the bank, and then the money explodes, and the red dye is all  over you, and the cops can find you.  Same thing, body glitter. 
[01:37:30]  That stuff rubs off.  You know, if you're standing an inch away from someone, it doesn't jump off and get on  you.  Matt, but if you even brush up against somebody with it, it's all over you.  Matt has a solution for the glitter thing.  Matt?  Yo.  Hey.  What's happening, guys?  What's up?  Check it out.  I'm a carpenter, right?  And I've got to deal with insulation a lot.  Uh-huh.  And when I get the insulation all over me, you take masking tape.  You've got to keep it in your car.  And you put the masking tape on your arms and your body, wherever.  And you peel it off, and the insulation comes off.  So I'm thinking, if it works with these tiny little pieces of insulation, it's got to solve 
[01:38:00]  the body glitter problem.  No, this stuff does not all come off of people.  Duct tape.  Duct tape.  How about your hair?  How about it's in your hair?  Then you rip all your hair off.  No, baby.  I just decided to shave my head tonight before I came home.  You do what you've got to do, guys.  Thank you, Matt.  All right.  Do we have a Ken Stevens update?  Rick, yes.  Ken Stevens, surprise, still out. 
[01:38:30]  420.  Now he's smoking pot, is what it is.  Hot Melissa still out to lunch, too?  No sign.  No, no.  Oh, boy.  I hope they're at least smart enough to come back separately.  Oh.  Why is everyone cringing?  Nick, what's going on?  Yo, what's up?  Hey.  Yo, what are you going to show up about this?  Yeah, a lot of people pissed off, Ant.  This isn't something that is a big secret thing to let out.  Why?  No, it is a big secret thing to have for the women listening. 
[01:39:00]  This is a secret thing.  Nick, what would happen if I hadn't said anything and you came home with body glitter?  I haven't said anything.  Yeah, but you don't understand something.  Not every girl is wearing body glitter.  Now they're all saying in their locker rooms at work and everything.  You know what?  Oh, and they're right.  We should all start wearing body glitter.  No, they do it anyway.  No, they don't all do it.  Oh, yes, they do.  Oh, I don't think so.  It's a conspiracy, my friend. 
[01:39:30]  I don't think so.  It's bad enough we have to worry about the perfume.  God bless Febreze.  You're in the bed, you spray Febreze, and the smell is gone.  Now we can't get rid of this glitter.  You use Febreze to get the smell out of your bed?  Oh, that's the greatest invention.  The cheating kit.  You need Febreze and stuff that dissolves small reflective particles.  No, yeah, it's the best stuff.  Believe me, let your listeners know.  If you don't have time to change your seats, Febreze. 
[01:40:00]  All right, thank you.  Febreze.  Let's go to Dave.  I want to move on, but the stories are coming in now.  Dave, what's up?  Yeah, just last night, the exact same thing happened.  Come home, a couple of specks on my face.  Friend gave me a little kiss goodbye.  You know, haven't seen him in a while.  What's that?  Running right into you.  And what you're saying right now, she's listening.  She's going to kill me when she gets home.  Well, but you're telling the truth.  Dave, you said you haven't seen him in a while? 
[01:40:30]  No.  I think he meant, um.  Like, damn.  All right, all right.  I caught that, too, but I figured he meant the girl.  All right.  I hope he did.  Jesus.  Hello, body glitter.  Wow.  Thank you.  Yeah, that's your first line of defense.  Hey, it was a guy.  He's a gay friend of mine.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  I got something.  Yeah.  Ken, obviously not listening because he's doing a six-hour lunch today.  Yeah.  With Hob and Melissa.  Mm-hmm.  We have to give Hob and Melissa body glitter so we can track Ken Stevens. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, dude, that's great.  Anybody we can track in this whole place.  You see, everyone starts walking to him with body glitter on him.  Hey, wait a minute.  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  Did you see the sales guy with body glitter on him?  Everyone walks around looking like disco balls.  Oh, man.  That's funny.  I'm doing you a service, guys.  Lighten up.  That's funny.  All right. 
[01:41:30]  Want to take a break?  Yeah.  All right.  212-757-1027.  We'll be back in just a bit.  Gentlemen, sir, you're wacky.  Wimble out, Wednesday!  Are you matching me naked?  Overload.  Pleasure overload.  Oh, it doesn't make me pain.  It's the O&A show. 
[01:42:00]  212-757-1027.  We'll be going to the phones in a bit here.  Yeah, we haven't even taken a call except for John.  Hey, there's a lady outside the studio that wants to meet Psycho Mark.  Oh, yeah?  How many times did you hear that one in the last half a month? 
[01:42:30]  Oh, you know, right when you said that, I'm like, wow, that sounds familiar.  But we know how Psycho Mark treats the female listeners, so we're going to tie them up in a chair.  Oh, don't even joke.  Oh, God.  Yeah, you can send in instant feedback.  I've never seen more instant feedback in my life, by the way.  A lot of people checking in.  They all got their opinions, much like a-holes.  We're trying to print up as many as possible.  Most of the stuff we have to ignore. 
[01:43:00]  And I don't know what else to say.  You know what's weird about everything that's going on?  Yeah.  Black Earl lost his S in here.  He just lost his mind during commercials.  He lost his effing mind.  He came in.  He grabbed our big rolling cart that we used to carry the stuff from the office into the studio.  It's full of CDs and tapes and whatnot.  And just grabbed it and started shaking it up and down.  It looked like the old Samsonite commercial. 
[01:43:30]  Why?  I'm just saying the way he was abusing the piece of equipment.  He ripped the thing out of the whole...  He ripped the top part out of the car.  He came flying out.  Everything was flying out.  It's all in disarray.  I would love to know what he was actually so upset about.  Why don't we get Black Earl in here and see why he's so upset?  I think we all know, but it's always fun when he tries to explain himself.  He's got some rage.  I'll tell you one thing about Earl, though.  Yeah.  He's like a cockroach during a nuclear blast. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, yeah.  You know how they say cockroaches would survive a nuclear fallout?  Yeah.  That's Earl.  Yeah.  I would love to know how many guys he has seen come through these doors.  Yeah.  Since he started at WWE.  They come and go.  They come and go.  Always a treat.  Look who's in the studio.  Black Earl.  Earl?  Yes.  You were very upset during the commercials.  And we didn't know what happened.  All of a sudden, you came in, and I start hearing this banging and our machinery and everything being thrown around. 
[01:44:30]  What happened?  We all understand why you would be upset, but you want to express yourself live on the air today?  Well, that's good.  That's good.  No.  They didn't pick up the Black Rock Coalition show?  Is that what it is?  That would get me mad.  Sunday night.  Sunday night.  Now, what has you in a tizzy?  We're all venting here. 
[01:45:00]  No, it's just everything.  Yeah?  Well, say something.  What got you to where you picked up the rack there and just started going crazy on it?  Just a little frustrated.  That's all.  Yeah, but there's got to be something.  What are the things?  You're allowed to vent.  Just the whole situation.  Could you be any more vague?  No.  This is how he keeps his job, though.  See?  We should learn from Earl.  You are so right. 
[01:45:30]  This is what we should do.  We should learn from Earl.  Okay.  Hey, how could he possibly ever get fired if he doesn't, you know, say anything?  We always say something stupid that, you know, gets us almost fired.  It's vague Earl, now.  It's vague Earl.  All right, Earl.  Come in.  Give us a little more.  Without going into it, I'm frustrated for the same reason you're frustrated.  All right.  Okay.  That's good.  Without.  He's like the magic eight ball. 
[01:46:00]  Not quite ready to commit.  Signs say...  Earl should write horoscopes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Avoid things lying.  Right.  Hmm.  So, some of the same things we're upset about.  There wasn't something that ticked you right before you picked that up and started going crazy on it?  One thing?  No.  Not at all.  Wow.  Well.  Earl, I got a question for you. 
[01:46:30]  Why don't you wear any ice?  Where's some of your bling bling, Earl?  You need some bling bling.  You saw that on that TV, too?  I learned about the black community.  I love to learn about the black community.  I had no idea that the brothers, it's a status symbol, Anthony, to have some.  The bling bling.  Where's your bling bling?  No bling bling?  No bling bling.  Because usually when people wear all black, like you do, the gold chains and the bling bling looks all good. 
[01:47:00]  I hear some of the bling bling, also known as ice, can cost upwards of a quarter million dollars for one piece that hangs around your neck.  I started a whole thing, fool.  Mr. T.  The bling bling.  Mr. T. has some bling bling bling.  So where's your bling bling?  No bling bling.  None whatsoever?  Hmm.  All right.  Huh.  What do you think of the bling bling?  You seem vague on that, too.  I wouldn't pay a quarter of a million dollars for any bling bling. 
[01:47:30]  Earl's psychic hotline.  It's very vague.  Call me now.  You be asking me what the problem is.  You should be looking at yourself.  Call me now.  Earl's vague psychic network.  Earl, you feeling a little better now?  Yeah.  Would you like to turn at Sally the effing slut masturbator?  I'll pass.  You sure?  There we go.  We need someone to try out Sally the effing slut masturbator.  Earl, would you like to give it a try? 
[01:48:00]  No.  It says, eff this bitch hard.  Eff this bitch hard.  It also says, see in my mouth.  You want to try it out, Earl?  I don't know.  F my tight A.  You sure?  I'm not the big guy.  You're vague.  Ice cream guy.  It even has instructions.  Ram your big C here.  Well, perhaps I might think about giving it somewhat of a try.  So, Earl, you're just bummed out about what's going on today. 
[01:48:30]  Yes.  There you go.  That was very good.  You'll be bummed out.  Call me now.  What do you need?  Back in his little cubicle, he's got the incense burning and the smoke.  Call me, Earl's psychic hotline.  You ought to be keeping your eyes to yourself.  Call me now.  Man.  All right.  Well, we got absolutely no information out of Earl why he's pissed.  He was pissed enough to pick that up and throw it around. 
[01:49:00]  Yet he really can't convey to us what is pissing him off.  But we should learn from him.  Man, well, we're in that big meeting.  If we acted like him, I think we'd be styling right now.  Probably be VP or something.  Earl's going to work his way right up the corporate ladder.  We'll call him Black Rock Earl.  From the big CBS corporate building.  All right, Earl.  It's good to see your face.  Your man ain't no good. 
[01:49:30]  Girl, you've got to get away from him.  Earl, are you eyeing...  I'm looking.  I see the teacup card.  He's in prison, is he?  Call me now.  I hate that bitch.  Earl, are you eyeing any of the open offices?  No.  Okay.  A lot of open offices today.  We need...  He's cheating on you, girl.  We need Earl's cubicle out of the way.  So we can blow the wall out. 
[01:50:00]  I've got to tell you.  You know what I've got in the back of my SUV?  Downstairs right now.  A full-size foosball table.  I can't put it where I move.  The neighbors downstairs would go crazy.  Whack, whack.  But I want to set it up in our office or something.  But now we need a bigger office.  Set it up?  I've been taking something out of our office.  Yeah, I know.  Believe me.  Dude, why do you think it's still in the back of my truck and not brought upstairs?  I'm driving around.  Every time I step on the brake, ten foosballs go clunk into the front of the thing. 
[01:50:30]  I take off.  I go clunk into the back.  I want to bring it up, but I'm not sure I'll be loading it back in the freight elevator in a couple of days.  Look at my drawers.  There is nothing in my drawers.  I'm seeing problems with your show.  Call me now.  Earl, you don't have to worry, man.  You will be here when radio is something that people will receive directly in their head as they walk.  The new tuner.  They'll just be right in place and a chip in your head and Earl will be here. 
[01:51:00]  Earl would be old.  Yeah.  Let me tell you about an old day.  Right.  I've got to tell you.  They call me a black girl.  I remember when the girl should have stepped in out of a private area.  That's right.  Your hair will start going white.  I've got to drive the big flying N.E.W. bus.  Because we've got flying cars now.  Let me tell you about the old days.  When we didn't have them flying cars.  Big, tall, two big tufts of gray, white hair on the side of his head. 
[01:51:30]  Big tuft on his chin.  Let me tell you about the old days.  I used to drive the N.E.W.  When we drove on the feet.  Now they've got the flying cars and I'm still getting fat.  Hey, Earl.  When Ant and I are long gone, will you be telling stories about us?  I'm telling stories that you guys knew.  I remember all year was, what, 1998.  Let me tell you, back in our 1900.  Shut up, boy.  I'm talking.  I still can't understand why I was so mad.  It was something to do with somewhat of a situation I can't really talk about.  And that's why I'm still him. 
[01:52:00]  Flying cars and I'm still late to sticker stop.  Can't find it from 200 feet in the air.  With radar and all kinds of ash.  Nice to have you back.  I'll call me Black Earl, but I'm getting a little ashy.  Earl, I almost got you a Christmas present.  Oh, fuck's sake, geez.  So you can hang the pictures better.  Anyone else see the new gadget on TV?  Oh, is that the suction cup device?  No, the thing where you don't even have to, like, hold the nail anymore. 
[01:52:30]  What?  The super hammer.  The super hammer.  The super hammer.  I was going to get Earl the super hammer.  I almost ordered it, too.  Stop.  I guess you fill the handle of the super hammer with nails.  Right.  So now you don't even have to, like, you know, hold the nail and go bang, bang, bang.  How does it, which size nails?  Little brads or what?  Relatively small ones, but medium.  It's actually called, remember, I had you write it down, it's the auto hammer.  The auto hammer.  And I was thinking, man, this would be perfect for Earl.  It would cut his picture hanging time in half. 
[01:53:00]  Down to a week.  Let me tell you, I was hanging pictures back in the old days before we had the super hammer.  What do you want on this wall?  Back in the days when we had walls, now it's like a force field.  Just stick to it.  I'm still trying to get the Black Rock Coalition show on here at WANW.  Where are the white women at?  Future Earl.  Earl from the future.  Earl from the future.  I've been here so long, let me tell you.  Let me tell you about him.  Right.  Someday, Ant and I will be gone. 
[01:53:30]  We already know that.  But Earl will survive, and he'll be left behind to tell the stories.  I remember back, I believe it was 1990, back in the 1900s, I remember sitting there watching a girl shoot an egg, a hardball egg, out of her naughty parts.  I was right there in the studio.  Let me tell you about it.  Big tuft of white hair.  Big, like, pure white hair with a little white beard on there. 
[01:54:00]  Let me tell you about it.  I dressed all in black.  Black girl.  I remember the time the guards had a girl come in, I know, what they call it, the coochie fireworks.  She shot a bottle rocket right out of her most naughty part.  I'm still here.  They got the flying WANW van.  Used to roll on the street.  I used to crash it and get lost.  Now let me tell you about it.  They got a flying van.  What's the matter, Earl?  Here's Earl from the...  Earl, look, we're meeting each other.  You're Earl from the past.  It's like Earl in the future. 
[01:54:30]  No, Earl from the present.  Earl, no, to me, he's in the past.  Oh, okay.  It's like black to the future.  That movie.  I met myself.  Let's go to the under the seat dance.  I'm going to play some Chuck Berry.  Black to the future.  Earl from the present, yes.  Do you have anything to say there, Earl from the future?  Boy, you look terrible.  What do you want on this flux capacitor?  Dr. Brown, you're the whitest man I've ever seen. 
[01:55:00]  We can't get back to the future  unless we get 1.2 gigawatts of energy  into the flux capacitor.  Boy, that's a gigawatt.  Oh, bill's broke.  That could be like...  That could be a classic.  I remember.  Show about...  What was that?  19...  No, the year 2000.  Beginning of the century, I remember the boy of us. 
[01:55:30]  Everyone got arrested,  and I got one of our high-powered black attorneys.  Black girl for the future.  Black girl for the future.  The guy's untouchable, though.  Yeah.  And I have seen 50 people get fired  since being here.  That's right.  Earl's been here for 12 years,  so he must have seen  200 to 300 people get fired.  Now, there's in the future here at NAW.  You used to take them all over the galaxy.  Too bad they didn't have that one.  Carol Miller was around. 
[01:56:00]  I can't believe Scotchel's still alive.  How the hell's that happen?  I'm 98 years old,  and Scotchel's still alive.  Yeah, that's right, Scotchel.  Okay, come in.  He's doing a three-minute show on the cube.  It's taped two weeks in advance,  so he can nap. 
[01:56:30]  Our first brand-new character  in bit of the new year, Anthony.  And everyone catching on.  Andrew from Long Island.  I learned that now you have to play  Huey Lewis in the news,  Power of Love,  whenever Black Girl from the Future appears.  That's not like a hell of a future.  Too much.  Boobs, the world's universal language. 
[01:57:00]  Opie and Anthony,  your linguistic experts.  Whip them out Wednesday.  M-E-W.  Let's try John on line one.  John, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to mention  the Arnold Schwarzenegger  mishappened  that happened recently.  The radio chick mentioned it before,  10 minutes before they got off the air.  Yeah.  He groped some news reporter.  He groped a TV reporter. 
[01:57:30]  It was in my paper on Long Island,  but I can't find it in the New York edition.  I want to show these guys.  I couldn't find it either.  I just heard it like 10 minutes  before they went off the air.  She was saying that  he was staring at her cleavage  the whole entire time.  Hello, cutie pie.  All right, wait, wait, dude.  We need someone to send us the story  because I did read it.  I can't find it in the papers  that are in the studio  because, I mean,  there's some hilarious stuff  in this damn thing.  Yeah, he was saying  that she looked fantastic  the whole time. 
[01:58:00]  Right, right, right.  And she was too scared  to tell him off  because, you know...  Someone send us...  Now we're having fun.  Someone send us a link  to the story  because I can't find it.  All right, John?  Okay.  And then we'll share it  with everybody.  No problem.  Thank you.  Yeah, I heard about that,  but I want to read the story.  All right.  We found the Arnold story.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah, newyorkpost.com, Anthony.  TV reporter claims  Arnie groeped her.  You got some sound effects  to help us along  with this story, maybe?  Hello, cutie pie.  Of course.  And then we're going  to play the Arnold song. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, the Arnold song rules,  which is hilarious.  Maybe that movie  shouldn't have been called  kindergarten cop-a-feel.  What?  Maybe that movie  should have been called  kindergarten cop-a-feel.  Oh, I get it.  A British TV reporter says  superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger  made sexually suggestive comments  and groped her  after an interview, Anthony.  No problemo.  I was angry,  Anna Richardson said.  How are you?  She was angry.  I want to say,  you dirty bastard,  but you can't tell  a powerful man like him  to F off.  I'm just party pooper. 
[01:59:00]  The alleged groping  took place  with Schwarzenegger  was in London  doing interviews  for his new sci-fi flick  The Sixth Day.  Good morning.  The reporter,  who was wearing a miniskirt  and knee-high boots  for the interview,  said their chat  turned awkward  pretty quickly.  You're close.  You've come to me.  Now.  He kept saying  how fantastic I looked  and staring at my boot  boobs.  How are you?  And when the interview  ended, 
[01:59:30]  the married father  of four suddenly  turned into the  gropinator.  Now we're having fun.  When I went to shake  his hand,  he pulled me onto  his knee saying,  I really want to know  if your breasts are real.  Hello, beautiful.  Oh, my God.  Why are you kidding?  Dana.  Dana.  Dylan.  Dylan.  She told him  that she was an F-co.  What?  Wow.  She told him  that she was an F-co.  Excuse me.  Oh, man.  What, does she have  huge boobs then?  Well, that's the  British equivalent  of a triple D  bra size, Anthony.  Ah.  And that's when 
[02:00:00]  the robusty Richardson  said the star  took matters  into his own hands  and touched her breasts.  That's great.  He then said,  yeah, they are real.  Now we're having fun.  Yes, Arnold.  The stunned stunner  said she stood up  and told Schwarzenegger,  you're making me  very nervous.  You son of a bitch.  The 53-year-old  told her not to be  and pulled her  back onto his knee.  Whoa.  I said,  as the reporter 
[02:00:30]  speaking,  can I go, please?  He said, yeah,  and patted my bum  as I went off.  I don't play it.  Boom.  Now we're having fun.  Boom.  How are you?  I don't play it.  No problemo.  I don't play it.  Eh, eh, eh.  Hello, cutie pie.  I don't play it.  Boom.  Nice.  Schwarzenegger's spokesman  told the paper  the actor was getting  a raw deal.  I don't know anything  about this particular incident,  but Arnie is a big flirt, 
[02:01:00]  as is Anna,  he said.  There you go.  Arnold Schwarzenegger  trying to see  if this lady  with an F cup  had real boobs or not.  Yes.  Allegedly.  You want to play  the Arnold song?  Yeah.  This came in today.  It's really  effing funny.  No problemo.  I hope you're rolling, Tate.  I don't even know  who to give credit to.  Remember the movie  Total Recall?  Total Recall.  The movie rocks.  Listen to the very  obscure references 
[02:01:30]  in the song.  Yeah.  Some obvious references  and then he gets  really obscure  with the references.  Check this out.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.

[02:36:30]  Ouch  Hello  Ken how you doing  Gentlemen how are you  Very good  What's going on  Pardon  What's going on  Hmm  Not much  Yeah  We were just in the middle of a bit  Oh sorry  Yeah  Well  We were doing a news  Your producer gave me a phone number  And said to dial it  And I did  Yeah we're just going over  What's going on in New York  Yeah  Trying to upgrade the program  Oh yeah  How you feeling about the station these days 
[02:37:00]  And the shows and everything  Pretty good as a matter of fact  Yeah  I bet  Yourselves  Good  Good  Yeah  Having a great time  Yeah thanks again  Loving it  Lately  Yeah  And we like your new hire by the way  Which one  Melissa  Oh thank you  Everyone's enjoying her and her pictures  And I think she's a fine addition to the station  Good  How do you feel about Melissa  Me?  Yeah  I think she's a fine addition to the station  Right  Yep  Yep  Yep  Does she do anything Ted? 
[02:37:30]  Yeah what's she do?  She  Is her job to just look hot?  No I think she would tell you that  There's more to it than that  Yeah  Would you say she's a fine addition to your staff?  That's not polite  Well she's on your staff right?  She's on the station  On the station staff?  On the station payroll  Right  Okay so she's on the staff 
[02:38:00]  Gotcha  Yeah  Okay  Oh that's great  Have you heard the  No I've been out  Oh damn  Yeah  Obviously I've missed something  Where have you been?  Because we noticed  Ken we got here today at 1130  We figured we got some business to talk over  Right?  Some things to discuss  Uh huh  And no Ken  Yeah  Now although it does seem  That of recent  You have been spending more time here at NEW  And in New York 
[02:38:30]  Instead of your duties elsewhere in the country  Uh we've noticed you've been absent  For lunch  And maybe taking a little more time away from the station  Um than you have when you're usually here in New York  Ever since  Let's see  I guess what Ann's trying to say  Beginning of the week  You took a six hour lunch today  We've been keeping track  So you're assuming that that entire time was lunch  That hurts  No not lunch  No no  We're not assuming anything  We'd be silly to assume things 
[02:39:00]  Right  But um  That would be bad DJs  Because of many things  Because it isn't just like  You know you aren't here  There are other people I guess  That are employed by uh  NEW that also aren't here  So we're not just picking on you  There's other people  Let me just think off the top of my head  Who else  Was Melissa around today?  Uh no  No I didn't see her for lunch either  Yeah she took a few hours today too  Do you know where she might have been um  For her extended lunch Ken?  I think I see where you're going with this 
[02:39:30]  What?  What are you assuming?  Yeah  I'm shocked  I'm shocked that you would suggest such a thing  Mmhmm  Well you are a man  Well that would be impressive actually  You would like  No I'm a happily married man  With a six year old son  Hey  Hey you don't got to make excuses to me  You know  You can justify it any way you want  Well you try to do something nice for you guys 
[02:40:00]  And this is the reward  Can we uh  Can we take a look at your face for body glitter?  Yeah  You don't have any body glitter on you do you?  Body glitter?  Yeah you ever see body glitter?  There's a lot of strippers wear  You've seen the stuff right?  Oh so that would be like the telltale sign  If there's body glitter on my suit  Ken let me just give you a little word of advice  This stuff's impossible to come off  So you best just never get it on you  In any situation  I'm not saying anything's happening anywhere  But in any situation  Nudge nudge wink wink right?  Okay  Hi Ken 
[02:40:30]  Ken  Thanks for the advice  No problem  Burn that  Burn that suit  Ken can stinky come in and smell your fingers?  Would that be out of line in any way?  I think I'd have to draw the line somewhere  Yeah I wouldn't have smell them either  That's certainly a good place to start  Good choice Ken  Never let anyone bother  Can I go now?  Hey  You've got things to do  That's fine  I understand  Nothing more important than talking to you  Alibis to concoct  Whatever  Okay 
[02:41:00]  Alright Ken  Thanks for calling  Well have fun  And I'm glad we really got to the bottom of this  And cleared up a lot  This is a great job isn't it?  Yeah  Yep  Thanks  Alright Ken  Take it easy  Bye  Bye  There he goes  It's our boss  Ken Stevens  They're on to me  They're totally on to me  What are we going to do  About this?  Alright well I'm sold  Sounded like he was enjoying that 
[02:41:30]  I see no problem  It looks to me like  Any suspicions we've had  Have been thrown out the window  You know  He cleared everything up  Perfectly  He was  Where for lunch?  Oh we never said  Melissa was where for lunch?  Oh  Never said  Hey Phil  What's up?  Oh you guys are so fired  Are they going to at least put that stuff on for a little while  Before they replace you or something along that line? 
[02:42:00]  Yeah he didn't seem to be chuckling with that one  No not at all  It was one of the funny little times you've been on our airwaves  I don't know what happened  Yeah  You're in it  Alright Phil  Thank you  Take it easy guys  Bye  Hmm  Well it's all clear now  Hey why are they pulling us out of the studio?
