<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show, broadcast live from the Crazy Horse in New Orleans during Mardi Gras, was a chaotic and intoxicated affair.  The broadcast began with the hosts recounting their difficulties navigating Mardi Gras road closures to reach their hotel, their observations of the excessive vomit on the streets, and the general sights and sounds of Bourbon Street, including the aggressive bead-soliciting antics of Tom, a local character who targeted women of all sizes. Racial observations were made regarding bead-throwing. The New England Patriots’ Super Bowl victory was a major topic, with Ben's boisterous celebrations described in detail.  The hosts and crew were demonstrably drunk, frequently commenting on the intoxication of those around them.  The Super Bowl commercials and halftime show were deemed underwhelming.  A humorous Vermont Teddy Bears live read occurred.  Listener calls and appearances by Martini Steve (whose flamboyant Mardi Gras hat was a point of discussion) and his drunken exploits (including passing out in a strip club) punctuated the broadcast.  A shared breakfast at a restaurant with male waiters in drag was also recounted.


The show continued with a disastrous hotel breakfast story featuring "creepy" waiters and a chocolate stain (initially mistaken for feces) in one host’s bed.  First-class air travel was discussed, with a host detailing his brother's unfortunate seating experience next to a drooling, intoxicated passenger.  A significant argument ensued about Opie allegedly not covering a bar tab for his brother and Ben, leading to Anthony promising to pay for everyone's dinner. Jim Norton complained about the lack of soap in his hotel suite and the poor planning by Club Soda Candy.  The broadcast included live interactions with stripper Jolie and a caller who shared a flight with Norton.  Throwing beads and cups from the balcony was frequent, culminating in a near-miss involving a woman's drink.  The escalation of bead-throwing from gentle to aggressive was discussed, alongside their upcoming appearance on CBS Sunday Morning, focusing on indecency and past controversies.  A recorded bit about Charles Kuralt's alleged mistress and Tom's increasingly erratic and intoxicated behavior were played, with a brief interview of Tara Patrick.  The segment was filled with crude humor and sexually suggestive remarks.


The broadcast then focused on their chaotic live show from the Crazy Horse balcony, significantly hampered by excessive noise and Tom’s unwelcome presence. Tom's repeated unwanted physical contact, particularly licking Norton's head, was a recurring theme.  A failed attempt to have Club Soda Kenny conduct street interviews via wireless microphone (due to technical difficulties and Kenny’s bead-throwing) was highlighted. The hosts commented on the topless women and general Mardi Gras debauchery.  Audio clips from a Geraldo Rivera interview with Michael Jackson regarding child molestation allegations were played, with humorous commentary.  A song parody about Christopher Reeve’s accident and an extended bit about Robert Reed’s portrayal of Mike Brady were also included.


The final segment featured a highly intoxicated Tom repeatedly groping a dancer, Carly, prompting frequent calls for someone to punch him.  Objects were thrown from balconies onto the set, including cups and beads, with at least one near-miss hitting Opie.  Tom's substance use (hallucinogenics and alcohol) was discussed.  An improvised bit about Tara Patrick's missing toy fox, and details about her upcoming appearance, continued. Martini Steve appeared briefly. The broadcast concluded with a bizarre and explicit description of a fictional "male group orgy competition" advertised on Gaper View.

Well, you go in back in the office upstairs, and they'll give you a BJ up there for real.  I'm not kidding around.  We'll go there later.  I was like, Tom, how about just a high?  We haven't seen you live in two years.  Yeah, I'm pretty high.  What do you want from me?  The guy is such a drunkard.  Every time he comes over, I don't even have to look around to see if he's around me. 
[00:07:30]  Do you notice the aroma that follows Tom?  Yeah.  It's Brut by Fabergé and beer.  And that mixture, it's Tom when he comes by.  You smell him before you see him.  And there's a teeth update with Tom.  Oh, yes.  His teeth are horrendous, but they don't smell as bad as last time.  Right.  Anyone else notice?  I kind of backed my head away.  I haven't gotten close enough yet.  Yeah, because he's still a close talker, but at least we're not getting the real bad rotting teeth.  Oh, my God.  Bad breath thing.  No, his teeth, it looks like a beach in Phuket. 
[00:08:00]  Just mud and trees and human waste.  He's just going to pick the stuff between his teeth, and that's the mushrooms we're doing later.  Those are the mushrooms.  I cure them here in my choppers.  What a scene, though.  They like to grow in a dark, dank place.  This is a crazy scene.  We have so many Opie and Anthony fans stopping by already.  Where were those two guys with the Monster Rain signs?  They're right below us.  Where are the signs?  Is that where they are?  Yeah, Monster Rain.  Yeah.  And they have another one that says Banana Phone ONA XM 202. 
[00:08:30]  And then one, I guess, for Rick, what did it say?  Swim, bitches, swim.  Yeah, that's all it says.  But yeah, a lot of people, a lot of fans of the show stopping by here in New Orleans.  How you doing?  Yeah, see?  Right away.  They're all taking pictures of us.  Snapping pictures.  We're on display.  We're handing out beads.  We got the Mardi Gras panties we're throwing down to the ladies.  It is, yeah, quite the scene.  And we're going to be here partaking in the festivities. 
[00:09:00]  Hey, Ben, throw them to somebody else.  We're not quite.  I've noticed we're not quite as tanked as we were last time we came here.  No.  We were pretty well hammered and gone by the time we even hit the airwaves.  I haven't had a drink yet.  No, it was the hurricanes that did us in last time.  And the listeners have been talking about our last New Orleans broadcast for years.  Like, how awful it was.  So we figured maybe we'll at least try to do a broadcast today.  I got it.  Sorry, Ovi.  I have a Pats fan that's yelling at me right now.  Dude, I said the Pats were going to win. 
[00:09:30]  I absolutely gave it to you guys.  I said the Pats were going to win, too.  Of course.  Who didn't think the Pats were going to win?  He's jumping around like Ben.  Yeah.  Well, speaking of Ben, we got to talk about Ben.  Ben, just before we went on the air, I think that's why we had technical problems.  Ben sneezed all over himself.  And it was all over his glasses, too.  What the hell happened?  You sneezed into your hand, and he blew snot, and it was actually connecting his nose  to his glasses.  His glasses were covered.  His face had a miscarriage. 
[00:10:00]  We're trying to get Ben's mic on.  I can't hear you, Ben.  He was a mess.  He sneezed.  He just had snot all over.  His lenses looked like Bourbon Street.  It was a mess.  Because he had a mouthful of cheese and, like, ham sandwiches.  Yeah, he was eating.  I was eating, and we didn't have much time, because getting up back with the sandwiches  so late, and I was eating, I sneezed, and it was food went all over my face.  And then I got Tom behind me, trying to, he's knocking my head with beads.  He's really a pro, Tom, at getting the girls to perform for the beads.  He won't just throw them down. 
[00:10:30]  He's yelling at girls, come on, show me your titties.  Just show me one.  I'll throw you the beads here.  He's an animal with these beads.  But the problem is, he has no discretion.  He wants the fatties to show as well.  Oh, my God.  The girl he got to show just before we went on the air, she had to be about 350 pounds.  With no boobs.  A slob with no boobs.  She was what we call a flatso.  Yeah, yeah.  All belly, no boob.  And he got her to flash.  Not that we wanted to see it, but he's a professional. 
[00:11:00]  He's here every year.  He knows the drill.  It's like fishing.  He has all sorts of beads.  He's got the really cheap ones for the 10-year-old girls where you can't have them show anything, obviously.  Yeah, then he throws the cheap ones down.  I've noticed there are a lot of girls.  Ben was throwing panties down to a girl that was about 12 years old.  Ben had no clothes.  Like, stop.  What are you doing with her?  She did have a nice ass.  And then Tom has the really nice beads, and he has the Mac Daddy of beads around his neck that he's waiting for.  He almost got a girl to show the clam for the beads that he had around his neck. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, he gets girls to show their boobs, and then he goes for the snatch.  All right, who's the racist up here on the balcony?  That's all I want to ask.  Why, why?  I'm just noticing a pattern here.  Yeah?  When the black chicks come walking by, the beads are getting thrown down to them a little extra harder.  I swear to God.  Do you think people are on purpose?  Look, dude, I don't know.  I mean, half the balcony is our crew, and then there's another half that I don't know who those people are,  but I just saw some beads get rifled at some black chicks.  I don't care about the color of their skin, but, you know, some of these girls, the black chicks that have walked up, 
[00:12:00]  we saw one, looked just like Samuel L. Jackson.  And I don't want to be throwing beads and seeing the boobies of a girl that looks like Samuel L. Jackson.  Throw me the beads!  All right, speaking of Tom from New Orleans, let's get Tom on the air.  My bra is the one that says, baby, motherfucker.  How you guys doing?  Oh, Tom, there he is.  What's going on, Tom?  He came here.  Come on, baby, I need to see some titties.  He's tanked.  He's already tanked.  Look at him, he won't give the mic away. 
[00:12:30]  He's fighting the pen for the mic.  Are we going to lick Norton Ken again?  No, stand back over there.  Come on, Norton.  You know you love me.  I do love you.  Ben's trying to keep him away.  I smell him from here.  He's awful.  He is so happy.  Dude, he just licked his tongue, and he just wiped your head.  Oh, God damn it.  No, that's going to drive Norton nuts.  We'll have Kenny take him away.  That's going to drive Norton absolutely nuts.  Tom is gone.  He is gone.  You know what the equivalent of having him lick your head is?  Have somebody take you and rub your head in that liquidy gutter down there between the 
[00:13:00]  ground and the sidewalk.  That's exactly what it's like.  The walk from the hotel over here to the Crazy Horse balcony.  Hold on.  Can we slow down a second, though?  Because you just said something that was kind of funny, the walk from the hotel to over  here.  Yeah.  That was the first time you left the hotel.  I have not been out of the hotel since our plane landed, and we went to the hotel and  checked in.  I have not left.  We checked in, what, three, four days ago?  I don't even know at this point.  It seems like that.  Yeah.  It's New Orleans time.  A day is like three days back home.  I believe it was Saturday afternoon we got in, right?  I guess. 
[00:13:30]  And now it's Monday afternoon.  I just left the room.  Yeah.  I want to start by the brainiacs that decided that we could just easily get to our hotel  on a Saturday night on Bourbon Street.  Oh, my God.  They had roads just blocked off, what, a mile in every direction?  Yeah.  There's no vehicular traffic on these roads.  It's all pedestrians packed.  I mean, from building to building, across the street, on the sidewalk, in the streets,  you cannot even walk, never mind get a car through there.  Yeah.  So we're in this limo, the whole crew, you know, and all of a sudden there's the road 
[00:14:00]  block, and we're like, you've got to be kidding.  We're like 10 blocks away, and we've got luggage and everything.  Minimum of a half a mile.  And they're like, sorry, you're going to have to unload here and bring your bags to  the hotel.  We're like, what?  Club Soda Kenny jumps out of the limo, shows his badge, says a few things.  Next thing I know, it's like the parting of the Red Sea.  Kenny is walking next to the limo like Secret Service for the president.  Yeah.  And everyone, he's just going, get out of the way, watch your backs.  And, yeah, the crowd was parting. 
[00:14:30]  Our car got to drive through right up by the back door of the hotel, pretty much.  Yeah, it was perfect.  It was like that scene from In the Line of Fire.  Yeah.  I felt very proud to have Kenny with us.  So then what happened was we check into the hotel.  I go, all right, Ant, see you later.  Yeah.  And this is the first time I'm seeing you.  Like two days later, I finally see Ant.  So anyway, you left the hotel for the first time and the walk over here.  I don't leave the room because I remember last time we were here.  And last time, it was a clusterfuck. 
[00:15:00]  We all remember that.  Didn't we make a pact?  We were here, what, two, three years ago?  We said we would never return.  We absolutely said we are never, ever coming back here again.  But kind of looking back on it, I think it had a lot to do with the broadcast.  It was so bad.  It was, I mean, it's memorable now as being one of our worst broadcasts ever.  Ever, right.  But people now look at it fondly as that.  Yeah.  So I think that put us off to it a little more, too.  The walk back to the hotel last time, we've yet to do that, by the way. 
[00:15:30]  I think you guys have, though.  You've walked these streets at night.  We've been all over the place.  We were in some crazy Irish bar last night for the Super Bowl.  We'll get into all that.  That had a lot to do with it, too, because it is disgusting.  Right.  Your brother has a photo that he showed me that is the definitive Mardi Gras picture.  I don't mean the beads, the girls with the tits, the balconies, the people.  Not that.  It was one picture he showed me.  It was a close-up of a vomit splattered on the street with some beads in it.  You know what the best part of that picture is?  It's like Technicolor.  You see how vibrant the colors were? 
[00:16:00]  The greens were piercing.  When we first got here on Saturday, my brother and I, the cool part is Bourbon Street is just a complete sea of people.  It's like a river of people.  You could deal with it for about 10 minutes before you just want to punch someone, unless you're up on one of these balconies, right?  But the cool thing about New Orleans and Mardi Gras is to go down these side streets.  That's where it's manageable.  Right.  And that's where everyone pukes, because they're on Bourbon Street.  They've had too much to drink, too many hurricanes.  And all of a sudden, they're like, all right, I've got to go somewhere and puke, so they go down the side roads. 
[00:16:30]  So the side roads are just littered with these amazing freaking piles of puke, and we've been taking a ton of pictures.  We're going to make a collage of it.  Vomit hopscotch you play when you're going down the side streets.  Right.  So, yeah, you were talking about the walk over here.  Yeah.  The sidewalks, even though we got up early to go to breakfast this morning, and what happens is they get the crews out with their powerful hoses, and they hose everything down.  Yep.  You've got to see this freaking street at, like, I think we were up pretty early, 8.39 in the morning. 
[00:17:00]  I remember from last time we were here.  Disgusting.  It is putrid.  And then after they hose it down, you know, they're not getting on their knees and scrubbing it with a scrub brush.  Oh, my God, we're about to see some amazing boobs.  Oh, there she is.  Tom's working this one.  This girl is beautiful.  Go ahead.  They don't scrub the street, so it just kind of collects in the gutters now.  Right.  And the smell coming out of these gutters when we were walking over, I swear I almost puked.  Yeah.  It hit me at one intersection.  It was vomit and, like, bad hot dogs. 
[00:17:30]  And just bad, like, bar beer.  Yeah, bar beer.  That stale beer smell.  That morning-after bar smell.  And the sidewalks are all slimy.  It's like taking a whole bunch of lard and just, like, you know, just, you know, rubbing it into the sidewalk.  You can skate to the hotel.  And I think that's what kind of turned us off to it last time.  It's like my last memory of it is that.  And then going back to the room, and then we flew out the next day.  Right.  So I was kind of.  Oh, wow.  That was a nice one. 
[00:18:00]  I was kind of leery about leaving the hotel since we've been here.  Yeah.  So me and my chick just hung out, you know.  You're kind of in a hotel, and you're with your girls.  So it's kind of cool, you know.  There are things you find to do in the hotel in between getting room service and watching the Super Bowl.  Nothing wrong with that.  It wasn't, you know, it was nice.  But tonight, we're going out.  And I think we might even stay here at the Crazy Horse because we've seen chicks coming in and stuff.  The stage looks nice.  It looks like a nice comfy place.  So I think we're going to hang out here and watch some chicks dance. 
[00:18:30]  There's nothing wrong with that at all.  Jimmy, what's going on, buddy?  Just watching all the girls flash.  There's really nothing above a five here.  So far, it's been, well, this is like the daytime flashers, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like the daytime strip clubs and stuff like that.  But you know what I noticed, too?  Jimmy's right.  The girls and the guys that are with them, a lot of them in the daylight look like those couples you see on those HBO sex specials.  Where they go to those sex clinics to learn how to give a head and use a dildo and have an orgasm. 
[00:19:00]  And they're the most heinous people you ever want to see.  They're about 50 years old, flabby.  That's the type of people you get at this hour.  I think later at night, it does kind of get better because those people are probably still sleeping.  We were talking to some of the locals, and they said that Mardi Gras this year is a little weird.  It's a little earlier than usual, so you don't get as many college kids here.  Oh, is that what it is?  You get the nice young meat.  There's a lot of middle-aged women just flashing like crazy.  Look at this girl, completely topless with the body paint on. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, she's painted, got beads on.  She's got piercings.  Her boobs are painted in like a daisy flower.  We saw a couple of women that were about 60 years old.  They were wearing nothing but fishnet for shirts.  And it was heinous.  Like they left looking at themselves going, yeah, this is going to work today.  And people were giving them beads just so eventually it would cover their awful boobs.  I look good.  Really horrid. 
[00:20:00]  So there's just so many stories to get to.  I don't even know where to begin, man.  We were watching the Super Bowl last night at an Irish pub.  Norton was there, and Master Poe was there, Club Soda Kenny, the whole gang.  And Master Poe was pretty much guarding Ben from getting the shit kicked out of him, basically.  Ben, huge pass, Ben.  Dude, you have no idea.  I know you're going to, like, you know, fight back here a little bit.  Ben was so excited as well as he should.  You know, the Pats won their third Super Bowl in four years.  I know.  Got to give it to them.  The dynasty, Opie. 
[00:20:30]  The dynasty.  Don't forget to mention the dynasty.  Everyone is talking about the dynasty.  And, uh, Ben, every play was just doing the hergy jerk.  Ben would, every time there was something good, Ben would leap off his chair and do this awful,  like, jump up and down in a circle dance and then do, like, a quick jerk.  And this guy's playing a video game.  They wanted to punch him in his large skull.  He's bumping into people playing video games.  Because the club, I heard, I wasn't there, was packed.  Absolutely packed.  I mean, Ben was the one with the most room because he was, like, moshing with himself.  Well, wait a second. 
[00:21:00]  I had to, I was the one with Opie's brother that went all day to get a table at a place.  And then these guys were just going to blow us off.  But we had to get a table because everyone was sold out.  It was nuts.  Crazy and insane, by the way.  Yeah.  So we got one of the better tables in the place.  But then we lost all the chairs.  It was nuts.  It was crazy.  It's crazy insane.  It's nuts.  Anyway, yeah, I mean, you had maybe three inches of room on either side of you the whole time during the Super Bowl last night.  But Ben, man, he had at least three or four feet around him at all times because he would just jump up after every crazy play and do this whacked out dance. 
[00:21:30]  By the end of the Super Bowl, we had five or six people imitating Ben doing the herky-jerky dance.  It was hilarious.  It's like Homer Simpson.  It's going to be huge.  They're going to start doing it in the end zone.  Right.  Do the herky-jerky.  Do the herky-jerky.  You know those, you know the video game, golf game or whatever?  Yeah.  It's a really heavy machine.  At one point, Masterpone and Club Sertacanity both lift this thing up off the ground and move it because these guys, these jarheads, were ready to just beat the crap out of Ben. 
[00:22:00]  Kill Ben.  Because he kept bumping into them, and he had no idea he was bumping into people.  Very excited, Ben.  What an obnoxious Ben he was.  After they won, he's going, it's the slightest thing.  He's crying.  It was the first emotion I've ever seen him feel.  I was very excited.  I know you were.  It's the slightest thing.  I had to watch.  They're all like leaving.  I had to watch the trophy ceremony and all that.  Of course you did.  Of course you did.  I got to tell you, though.  That Super Bowl, I mean, the game was exciting, but, I mean, we don't even need to talk about the Super Bowl commercials.  They stunk. 
[00:22:30]  You know something?  It was a non-issue, the commercials.  Every year, everyone makes a big deal out of them.  This year, because of the controversy of last year with Janet Jackson, Boobie, showing, and then everyone jumped on the bandwagon and saying that the commercials were risque, the farting horse and, you know, the semi-clad women in the commercials.  So now they pulled back on that also.  And it made it the most just unmemorable Super Bowl as far as commercials go and halftime show ever. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, they rated, like, the Burt Reynolds commercials the best commercials.  Eh, stunk.  That made, you know, made fun of all the past commercials, basically, all the cliche things they used in the Super Bowl commercials.  I don't know.  You know what's going to happen.  Next year, you're going to see all the crazy commercials come back, and I'll tell you why.  Because people don't feel like they got their money's worth.  I mean, how much was the 30-second spot?  You know, the same as it was.  What was it?  2.4 million for a 30?  It was like something like 4.8.  For a 30-second spot.  4.8, I think, for a minute spot.  And no one wants to pay that kind of money for a commercial no one's going to remember. 
[00:23:30]  Right.  And they only remember the ones that are a little risque, a little spontaneous-looking, something that's memorable, edgy.  Now, this year, nothing like that because everyone was so scared.  So they backed out.  A lot of people, a lot of the big companies didn't spend a whole lot of money putting these commercials together and getting them on the air.  So you wound up with a very lackluster showing.  Money talks, so you watch.  Next year, all the crazy commercials will definitely come back.  And then you had Paul McCartney at halftime.  Oh, what did you think of that? 
[00:24:00]  The most boring halftime show I've ever seen in my life.  I mean, it was the safest thing you could get.  It was Paul McCartney standing on the center of a stage with his bass guitar, his band on the peripheral edges of this big stage.  And that was it.  They had some fans, I guess, around the stage.  But none of them even dressed remotely risque.  Playing his songs, which are, you know, safe, old Beatles songs.  How out of hand can you get when you're playing old Beatles songs? 
[00:24:30]  Right, right.  Get back.  Yeah.  Hey, Jude.  It was not.  What danger are you going to get in there?  No, it was pretty interesting.  In the bar we were at, though, the whole crowd was singing along to Hey, Jude.  Yeah, it was.  And these, I mean, the average age in the bar we were at last night could have been higher than 25, 26 years old.  And everyone was just singing along to Hey, Jude.  No, you missed it.  We're in Louisiana.  They were actually singing Hey, Jude.  Don't come in here.  They put it together.  I mean, Paul McCartney, he sounded great. 
[00:25:00]  I'll give him that.  He sounded just like the record.  You might as well have just played a Beatles album.  Right.  Because that's pretty much what it amounted to.  It was boring.  I mean, we're getting to the point.  Just bring back the marching bands for halftime.  Hey, they're spelling out USA.  This is fascinating.  There was nothing to that.  It was very safe, milk toast, and pablum.  Thank God the game was very good.  One of the better games in recent years.  Well, it was great.  The last three Super Bowls that the Pats were in, you know, they've given three great, 
[00:25:30]  great games.  The game wasn't a blowout.  The Eagles, they looked good.  They looked a little more disorganized.  The Pats looked like they needed a little time to get themselves organized.  I think they were really pumped up and had it settled down a little bit.  But the Eagles did a good job.  And, you know, Terrell, you'd like to bash him, but he came across pretty well.  Somewhere around the second quarter, I asked my buddy Bull, who he's down here, 
[00:26:00]  broadcasting.  I worked with him in Buffalo, Rochester.  We've had him on the show over the years.  And I go, Bull, is T.O. even playing?  You know, I was like, I forgot that, you know, he was even playing.  With his screwed together ankle.  Every time he was making those moves, they'd show some slow motion clips of him  really changing the direction that he's going in in a split second on his toes.  And you see, they would show it.  And I was cringing, like, I just want to see screws in a spring pop out. 
[00:26:30]  Just watch his foot fall off.  This is the most distracting thing, because we're trying to do a talk show.  And out of the corner of your eye, all of a sudden you'll see another girl flash.  Yeah.  You just keep talking, enjoy the breasts, and then move on.  And then I have to think, what was Anthony just talking about?  Because, you know, some of you don't care about others.  You're like, oh, hey, look at that.  It's funny, all the beer trucks are making their way in down Bourbon Street,  because it's time to, you know, to reload in all these bars.  Reload, bar supply, trucks, everything.  And I've noticed that the Budweiser trucks and the Coors Light trucks  and the rest of them are so much more important than the lives of these human beings. 
[00:27:00]  They get top priority.  You see how these things are backing up pretty much right over people.  They don't care.  It's like, they've got a job to do, man.  They've got to get, you know, all the bars reloaded.  Yeah, I saw one person waving off.  There's one of the trucks beeping.  I saw him waving off a linen truck, like, I guess, for napkins and tablecloths.  They were waving him away so they could back the Bud truck in place.  So you know what the priorities are here.  Just ask Tom.  He knows, too.  Drinking.  I think Tom's passed out somewhere. 
[00:27:30]  Drinking, god damn.  We've been doing the Tom line, you know, the whole time we've been down here,  wherever we are, we're like, you can drink right here in Starbucks.  Yeah, it doesn't matter, because his big line last time he came here was,  they let you drink right here in the airport.  And when we landed, I was amazed, you know,  there's guys with big beer cups, they've got that hand grenade cup  that looks like a hand grenade, drinking the hand grenade out of it,  the hurricane.  And you walk around the airport just drinking,  and everyone's hammered at the luggage carousel.  You know, Tom gets on the bags because he thinks it's a ride, 
[00:28:00]  and he starts going around because he's drunk off his ass constantly.  So then every place we go, yeah.  They let you drink right here in the Starbucks.  Yeah, let me tell you, they let you drink right here in the emergency room.  I don't know about the dentist's office.  They might let you drink there, but I couldn't tell you.  Dude, we got such an Opie and Anthony crowd out here.  It's not even funny.  We got Opie and Anthony T-shirts and signs.  It's getting nuts.  We got a Pats fan down here that's just lambasting me.  I was rooting for the Pats. 
[00:28:30]  Ida Dynasty, right, I know.  All the Eagle fans are mad at us because I was rooting for the Pats.  They're like, how can you do that to us Philly fans, bro?  Come on, what's wrong with you?  You know, if I'm going to bandwagon jump, it's going to be with a winning team.  All right, why the hell would I go for the Eagles?  We're just getting started.  Why don't we take a break?  You all right, Ben?  Yeah.  Everything's great.  When we come back, we've got to talk to Martini Steve and Club Soda Candy.  Martini Steve's got the...  It can only be described as the flaming pimp hat. 
[00:29:00]  I heard about Martini Steve on evening number one.  And perhaps our audience...  Look at Ben, he's herking and jerking.  Ben, don't herky and jerk too much or this whole freaking balcony is going to fall over.  People throw Ben beads because they think he's dancing.  They're like, oh, look at that guy's really into it.  He's into the spirit of things.  All right, we should play something going into break.  Maybe in honor of Paul McCartney.  You want to do one of your Brother Joe songs?  Oh, those are cool.  Either Lady McCartney or amputee Heather Mills. 
[00:29:30]  Which one is...  Lady McCartney one's better.  I think we played that one the other day, though.  We could play it again.  I don't care.  We also got to talk about our appearance on national TV.  Oh.  Sunday morning.  Sunday morning.  I missed it.  It was pretty cool.  We have so much to do.  We're just getting started.  Sophie and Anthony broadcasting live from the Crazy Horse on Furman Street.  I think Sex Bagels ready back in New York.  If you're ready, Sex Bagels.  Having a great time there in New York.  Why don't we play Lady McCartney and we'll continue with the O&A program.  Lady McCartney used to have two feet. 
[00:30:00]  Plain to see your lower half's incomes lead.  Saved lots of money.  Got a great excuse.  Can't have price on pedicures, foods, and shoes.  Every night she takes on for prosthetics. 
[00:30:30]  Hops in circles when she tries to run.  Yes, she only has to tie one shoelace.  She has a stuff.  Lady McCartney always has a past.  Woodpeckers, they gather beneath her dress.  Woodpeckers, they gather beneath her dress.  Woodpeckers, they gather beneath her dress.  Woodpeckers, they gather beneath her dress.  Woodpeckers, they gather beneath her dress.  Woodpeckers, they gather beneath her dress.  Woodpeckers, they gather beneath her dress.  Woodpeckers, they gather beneath her dress.  Woodpeckers, they gather beneath her dress. 
[00:31:00]  Woodpeckers, they gather beneath her dress.  Woodpeckers, they gather beneath her dress.  Woodpeckers, they gather beneath her dress.  Woodpeckers, they gather beneath her dress.  Woodpeckers, they gather beneath her dress.  Woodpeckers, they gather beneath her dress.  Woodpeckers, they gather beneath her dress.  Woodpeckers, they gather beneath her dress.  Woodpeckers, they gather beneath her dress.  Stop, stop, stop, stop.  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  She has a stop.  Lady McCartney, outside on the deck.  Guess the rate there's time I'm chewing on your leg. 
[00:31:30]  Tuesday afternoon, she's looking sexy.  Then I lift her skirt and see that stump.  Close my eyes and fantasize while effing.  She has a stop.  Lady McCartney, or should I say Eileen?  How you gonna curtsy when you meet the queen? 
[00:32:00]  Live from Mardi Gras.  They are funny, entertaining, and don't take themselves too seriously.  It's called sarcasm!  Hello, exactly!  Oh, yeah!  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:32:30]  Opie and Anthony, XM202.  Swishin', they can't destroy.  Swishin', they can't destroy.  Those are packed in there.  Swishin', they can't destroy.  Thumbs up to you.  Swishin', they can't destroy.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:33:00]  And we're broadcasting live from Bourbon Street in New Orleans at the Crazy Horse.  The Crazy Horse rocks.  This place is very, very cool.  We're gonna have to check out the festivities after the broadcast.  Oh, hell yeah.  I don't know about going to a strip club with Tom, though, and getting a Hummer in some cheesy office while you're being videotaped.  I really don't think I need that.  You'd probably say, and not a surprise, I'm the one giving it.  I love you guys.  I don't even know where that strip club is he's talking about.  He said it's off the beaten path.  Oh, it's probably around the place that I heard, because, of course, I was in my room, Opie, much of this trip. 
[00:33:30]  I just got out today.  It's kind of nice that you're out getting fresh air finally.  Yeah, kind of taking a look around, a lovely area.  But I was watching some of the local news here in New Orleans, and six murders.  Six murders in one day, by the way.  One day.  You don't even get that in all five boroughs of New York City nowadays.  But I was stunned.  There's Tom now, in the middle of Bourbon Street, holding up a drink.  It's a green drink. 
[00:34:00]  Is that the grenade or the green hurricane?  Isn't that a hand grenade?  I don't think it was green until it actually hit his teeth and he backwashed it.  Oh, right.  Some messed up chemical reaction turned that green.  Someone's throwing beads at him.  He's coming back up.  The guy's yelling, it's a grenade.  Tom's throwing a grenade.  Oh, it's a grenade?  A hand grenade?  I wanted a goddamn hurricane.  I wanted a hurricane.  Leave it.  You know something?  It served me right for sending Tom out for a drink water for me. 
[00:34:30]  I got you something.  Yeah, I know what you wanted, but I know what I want to give you.  And that's a hand grenade.  By the way, who?  I want to give him a hand grenade, a real one in his mouth.  Exactly.  He'll improve his teeth.  Who are these freaks on the other side of the balcony, by the way?  I don't know.  I think they're Tom's friends.  Those are Tom's friends.  Obviously, they're just babbling idiots.  They're trying to have a conversation with us and we're doing a radio broadcast.  While we're on the air.  You're talking in a head phone.  It's like, dude, it's a hurricane.  I'm stupid.  I don't care.  It was a question.  Yeah, we're broadcasting to the entire nation, but we have to listen to you.  Tom's filthy friends. 
[00:35:00]  Do you guys want to say hi to Billy Mac and talk about the Super Bowl?  He went down to Jacksonville.  Billy Mac was at the Super Bowl?  Yeah, sure.  Let's throw him on and see what happens.  See how it was to actually be there.  I heard it was kind of hell for anybody that went down there live.  I'm trying to get more headphone volume because it's getting louder and louder  up here.  Tom is losing his mind.  Oh, thank you.  That's much better.  Now I can hear myself.  Thank you.  All right, good.  Thank you, Tom. 
[00:35:30]  There we go.  Now we're all reaching back to the thing and turning our headphones back down a little  bit.  Let's just tell you.  That's cool.  Okay, that's much better.  Thank you, Jaime.  Jaime's doing a great job for us in the other room there.  Jaime is the best.  Let's say hi to Billy Mac.  He was in Jacksonville for the Super Bowl and let's see what he saw.  Billy.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  You just sound like you're having a much better time than anybody could have ever had in Jacksonville.  Let me tell you something.  I've got to ask one question.  Yeah.  Has Ben stopped patting himself on the back?  Well, he does it accidentally when he jumps up to cheer for a play. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, it must be the big schlong of his.  He emailed me about, not email, text message about 55 messages last night.  And the last one was, we are the best.  Yeah, he was yelling and screaming, Dynasty, all the way back to the hotel.  This is what I noticed about Ben.  As soon as the Super Bowl was over, everyone left him alone.  No one wanted to deal with Ben.  No.  No one.  We're like, hey, Ben, take care.  Jimmy went one way, I went another.  And next thing you know, Ben is all by himself celebrating the Pats victory.  Who wants to sit there and listen to him just gloat? 
[00:36:30]  No, it's awful.  His hair is all matted to his head and sweating.  Ah, that's it.  All right, Billy, so how was Jacksonville?  It just sounds like the worst place to have a Super Bowl ever.  Let me tell you something.  I'm going to try and keep it clean.  It's like having three pounds of garbage in a one-pound bag because no matter where you went,  I'm not bad against crowds, but they just had no idea what to do and how to do it.  I hope the phone's not clapping out because I'm at the airport.  But, you know, whatever you saw on television, it was just the PR people trying to tell you 
[00:37:00]  everybody had a good time.  Why were Puerto Rican saying that?  If you really spoke to the fans, it's impossible.  Nobody had a good time.  Billy, how far away from the stadium was your hotel?  Well, I got kind of lucky.  I was about 12 miles away.  We got a joint at the Jacksonville Airport, and then we scored a room with the Hilton,  which was actually at River Walk, if you're familiar with the place.  Not at all.  Nah, you guys are down on the wall, and it's probably as crowded down there as it was on  one location by River Walk. 
[00:37:30]  It's crazy.  Jesus Christ.  And what, they had the cruise ships lined up and people were staying on the cruise ships  because they didn't have enough hotel rooms and all that?  Well, one of the major networks, I'm not going to mention their name, had one cruise ship in  front of the Adams Mark, which was like the VNFL hotel, and you had to be whoever you were  to be there.  The rest of them were up a little west of the stadium, all hotel, but you really didn't  see them.  I don't even think you could see them on the TV shots.  Well, that's actually pretty cool.  You couldn't get it.  If you were a regular Joe like myself, there's no way you were getting anywhere near that. 
[00:38:00]  Well, after the people were done with the Super Bowl, did they go back to the cruise ships  and watch Boston 20 minutes on stage?  Jimmy, I couldn't hear you, but you probably just thought about the thing whacked off.  I don't know.  No, no, no.  That was fun.  Billy, Billy, I'd like to know who joined you at the Super Bowl.  Well, I really didn't get a chance to meet up, but we had a good conversation, and he's  back home.  Did you talk to him about coming on our show at all? 
[00:38:30]  You know what?  I really didn't get a chance to do that, and I'm going to do that because I'm coming back  down next week for the Daytona 500, so we're going to be in communication with that.  Was he alone, or was there a female companion with him?  You know what?  Like I said, I only spoke by phone, so I'm not quite sure what you're talking about.  You're good, Billy.  You are good.  You're a true friend of Jay's.  I'm not going to rat Jay Moore out.  I'll give you guys a shout again, and listen, have a good time.  By the way, you guys, have you been to Rick's Cafe yet? 
[00:39:00]  No, what's that all about?  Rich Tabaret?  You know what?  If you can't afford Rick's, try Temptations, and I'll leave you with that.  Goodbye, sweet cheeks.  We broadcasted live from Temptations last time.  That's a great club, too.  Yeah.  You can't say who it was, by the way, that he was down there with, but afterwards, they  went out and had a cough medicine daiquiri.  By the way, Martini Steve is filming us up here on the balcony at the Crazy Horse, and he's  got his flaming pimp hat on, Anthony, that we bought this morning after breakfast. 
[00:39:30]  This looks like it was made for Steve.  Like this hat was put together just for Steve to wear.  The flame pattern on it is exactly like the flame pattern on his shirt and his shoes.  You know, of course you can pick up flame wear anywhere, but to match the flames exactly  from his shirt and his shoes, it was meant to be.  And it's one of those wacky Mardi Gras hats.  Yeah.  It's all black fur, and then it's got like silver Christmas tinsel in it, and then the  top has flames, and underneath the brim has flames, and it is the gayest thing I've ever 
[00:40:00]  seen.  Steve, you can't hear us, right?  I was.  Did you see the sign in the store?  It said if you buy two of these hats, you get a free load on the chin.  Brocious.  Yeah.  He was very excited when he found this hat.  Wow.  Why is Steve freaking out?  What are you doing?  I'm not freaking out.  I'm just trying to put my...  Oh, he can't get the headphones around my hat.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  We can't get you headphones or the hat.  Well, this is what sucks.  Once again, we're doing this broadcast, we're literally a foot away from each other, but  it's so loud.  Jaime did a great job with the microphones and everything, but it's so loud. 
[00:40:30]  There's a bar across the way just cranking music, louder than I've ever heard music in  my life.  So we can't even hear each other.  We're a foot away.  So Steve has no idea what we're saying.  And there's a guy across the street who looks like Patrice O'Neill wearing a big purple  hat that just says no cover.  Yeah, he's trying to usher people in.  It's very loud here.  It's Bourbon Street Mardi Gras.  What do you expect?  You know?  We got to deal with it.  Right.  And Steve can't hear us talking, so he needs headphones.  I kind of feel guilty because when we got in Saturday night, we all went out, did a little  dinner.  And then we went to the House of Blues, and then we went to like a, kind of just a dive 
[00:41:00]  bar, you know?  And I was ready to leave, and I think it was Club Soda Candy and a bunch of us were heading  back to the hotel.  Steve looked at me.  He had a few in him, right?  Of course he did.  But he was trying to be responsible, and he looked at me, and he goes, I think I'm going  to go back with you guys.  And I, I'm an enabler, I think, because I go, Steve, nah, stay out, have some fun.  You're down in New Orleans.  Like, he was at that point where he was trying to show control, and he was ready to leave. 
[00:41:30]  And all he needed was someone like me to go, yeah, all right, come on back with us.  Yeah, come on back.  But instead, I'm like, nah, Steve, you know, why don't you stay and have fun?  You put that little walnut stomach to use.  Yeah, thank you.  So that's the last I heard of Steve until we all started getting the Ben phone calls  in the middle of the night, 2, 2.30.  I think Jaime has one on his phone.  Yeah.  Basically, Ben was calling everyone, laughing his ass off.  This was like 2, 2.30 in the morning, to tell everybody that Steve passed out at a 
[00:42:00]  strip club, and they don't know how they're going to get him back to the hotel.  Yeah, I completely fell asleep in an easy chair in a strip club with girls all over me,  kissing me, apparently.  And I have no recollection.  Apparently, I was tired and disinterested and belligerent.  You forgot belligerent.  I wasn't belligerent.  I heard belligerent.  I wasn't belligerent.  Is that what you call it?  Tired when you're passed out with a drink in your hand?  I wasn't belligerent.  It was a little tucked out.  Oh, sleepy.  I have no recollection of being belligerent.  He kept saying, I'm not going to rape you. 
[00:42:30]  I'm not going to rape you.  I'm not going to rape you.  That is not true.  I heard that's true.  I mean, that's just a rumor.  That is not true.  That's a rumor from another city.  We're talking about New Orleans now.  Yeah, that didn't happen in New Orleans.  But I just felt bad because he really wanted to be responsible and come back to the hotel.  And I was the one, I think, that pushed him over the edge.  He was like, nah, stay out.  Stay out where all the drunks are and all the alcohol is, Steve.  You'll be fine.  Good one, O.  And nobody loves Steve's misery more than Ben.  Yeah.  Like, you can't hold a discussion with Ben.  We're watching the game, and I'm like, yeah, man, it's first and four. 
[00:43:00]  He's like, yeah, Tom Brady.  Dude, hey, I'm Bear Steve.  I'm passed out.  Which is what throws all these awful non-sequiturs out of the conversation.  Well, I think what Ben was doing was sending the girls over to try to make out with Steve and stuff.  Right.  Even though he was a little sleepy.  Yeah, I was a little tired.  But I was trying so hard to maintain some little modicum of control.  Someone was telling me, too, that they finally got you up out of a chair.  You woke up for a little while.  And we all have these wristbands on.  It's the only way you can get in and out of the hotels. 
[00:43:30]  And Steve forgot where he was.  I swear this is true.  Someone said it.  All Steve said was, bring me here.  And points to his wristband.  Oh, my God.  He had no idea where the hotel was, and he didn't even know the name of the hotel.  But he remembered somewhere in his drunken stupor that the name of the hotel was on his body.  So all he said was, bring me here.  And he was pointing at his wristband.  You like tats.  You have tattoos.  You want to get your address tattooed on your wrist.  I really should.  So you could just go bring me here whenever that happens again in the future. 
[00:44:00]  I've gotten ripped drunk at Mardi Gras.  I can check that one off the checklist.  Now I don't have to do it again.  I heard that you passed out.  You were asleep in that chair.  Yeah.  And someone tried to give you a hot foot, but no one even noticed.  It was, put a little match in there, lit it, and nothing happened.  He wasn't passed out.  He was hibernating.  Yeah.  In his lair.  A little cozy bear.  He was very comfortable.  He was over him.  Hey, I'm Steve.  I passed out.  Thanks, man.  So then Steve was very responsible last night. 
[00:44:30]  I was.  As we were watching the Super Bowl.  I was amazed that he wasn't drinking last night.  Not a drop.  Oh, speaking of bear.  Oh, speaking of bear.  Oh, yes, Anthony.  You know, Valentine's Day is coming up.  Yeah.  And what better gift can you find than a Vermont teddy bear?  I say none.  I say none better gift than a Vermont teddy bear.  That's right.

Fantastic.  Yeah.  I was hoping to be through it before anyone noticed.  What a rip those guys did on Vermont teddy bear.  That was pretty good.  We love the gang at the Vermont teddy bear.

This is the new thing we're doing is live reads. 
[00:47:00]  Live reads are back on the show.  How about that?  That's very cool.  Here's a straw for your drink, Anthony.  Oh, thank you.  And it's wrapped like Howard Hughes likes it.  Thank you.  I saw that.  It was wrapped in a napkin, so other people touching it wouldn't upset me.  I like one more thing about the live read.  I can't wait to go on the message board and read, I pay for the channel so I hear commercials.  Shut up, stupid.  Shut up.  Shut up and stay tuned.  You'll be pleasantly surprised.  Yeah, you're going to be very pleasantly surprised.  And by the way, since the live read is over, can you mention that they have the Ben Sparks 
[00:47:30]  Bear, which twitches like it has parking tits and comes with an extra liver after a Super Bowl  party?  By the way, can we bring Club Soda Kenny in here?  Wow, the music's getting even louder across the way.  Yeah, people are screaming.  We need a mic for Club Soda Kenny.  Kenny's just looking at us like a deer trapped in headlights.  He has no idea what's going on because no one can hear us.  Girls are flashing below us.  We got Opie and Anthony freaking beer mugs that we're throwing down to the people. 
[00:48:00]  We're throwing down and hurting some people.  I like the people that actually, we got these, yeah, they're beer cups.  We throw them down to the people.  And sometimes they roll into the gutter, into the sleaze water in the gutter, and people  pick them up and wipe them off.  Well, talk about a little hepatitis cocktail next time you drink something out of that.  I guess it's a very valuable item.  There you go, fatty.  Wow.  Enjoy.  And we're throwing down these great, XM has like 5,000 of these Opie and Anthony cups.  There's the Opie and Anthony.  They have the little caricatures of the down syndrome heads. 
[00:48:30]  And then on the back, it says XM satellite radio.  So the ground is like littered with them, because once somebody misses it, they won't  pick it up.  Some people do.  Some people don't.  So yeah, they're kind of littering the roadway.  Don't you guys hear me popping on the mic every time I say P's?  Well, you've got to be a professional and know how to say your P's without actually popping  them.  All right.  I was doing the same thing.  I'm not a professional broadcaster either.  Don't worry about it.  I hope I get some lussies down here.  How's that?  Excuse me.  I'll come start to Kenny.  Kenny, hi.  Has made his way to this side of the balcony.  Hey, Kenny.  I just want to ask for a raise, because I have to deal with Tom from New Orleans. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, yeah.  And I want a raise for this trip.  I heard about that.  Back off the mic.  You don't have to swallow the mic there.  Yeah.  Is he really causing you anguish?  He's getting to that point.  Yeah.  He is very annoying.  Yeah.  Can you just make sure he doesn't lick Norton's head?  I'm going to make sure he doesn't do anything out of line.  All right.  Thank you.  Keep him in line, Kenny.  I just wanted to ask you one thing.  Yeah.  Did you send a girl to my room last night? 
[00:49:30]  No.  Because there was a girl came to my room last night.  She offered me super sex.  Yeah.  So I took the soup.  Thank you, Kenny.  Thank you.  I do have to.  Wow.  Did you enjoy breakfast this morning?  Don't give the gag away, but did you enjoy it?  What?  With the homo joint?  You took me too.  I didn't take you there.  Not a...  Homo joint.  Now listen to this.  The hotel recommended this.  Kenny goes...  You know, Kenny does everything for us on the road, right?  So he goes to the concierge. 
[00:50:00]  Concierge.  Concierge.  Consigliere.  And asks for a nice place to have breakfast, right?  Tom, I need a nice place for breakfast.  Tom, you're the concierge.  You talk to him.  Mike is the manager at his hotel.  So this guy suggests this place called Petunias.  Yeah.  Petunias.  Sorry, Tom.  I can't take it at Petunias.  You're out.  We should have known that it was going to be a strange place because it was called Petunias.  Petunias.  So we all go. 
[00:50:30]  We walk into the joint.  It was me and Kenny, my brother.  Steve.  And Steve the Bear.  Who fit right in.  He definitely fit right in.  The first thing we see as we walk in, it's all men as the waiters.  Ooh.  Dressed in drag with fluorescent wigs and fluorescent, like, eyelashes.  That doesn't tell you something right there.  They had, all had fake boobies.  They had Catholic schoolgirl skirts on.  Ooh.  With the thigh highs and the F me type boots. 
[00:51:00]  And why were you there long enough to even notice all this?  Why weren't you turned around and out?  Because we were hungry.  Yeah.  And I must say, the breakfast was very nice.  Very nice.  Eric, why, as soon as we walked in, I'm like, here's 15 to 20 minutes of effing radio, and  here's 15 to 20 sigpicks for whackbag.com and the rest.  True.  They look like female, like Oompa Loompas because of the fluorescent wigs and stuff.  The food was excellent, but we're looking at these guys like, what is going on here? 
[00:51:30]  I was trying to pick out the hot one.  Yeah, we're all going, so who do you think's the hot one here?  What, did you have eggs, Ben's dick?  So, so then we couldn't figure it out, and obviously we had these looks on our faces like,  what are you guys doing, right?  And then they finally explained that, I guess, once a year they have to dress up like chicks  because tomorrow's what, Fat Tuesday, right? 
[00:52:00]  Yep.  So I guess they're closed tomorrow, so it's a big deal, and this is what they do every  year.  They're known for this, to have their waitstaff, you know, dressed in drag.  So normally they're not in drag?  No, no, not at all.  So it was a gay joint, though?  No, it wasn't a gay joint.  No, no, it turned out to be very nice, actually.  Very hetero?  Yeah, the food was good.  Our waiter was like 350 pounds, dressed up like this, and he's trying to have a normal  conversation with us, and I'm like, could you just get me a refill of coffee, please?  Yeah.  It was just really, really awful.  Yeah, he wanted to make small talk. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  So, sounds great.  I'm sorry I missed it.  Yeah.  I said, cut the chit-chat, sailor.  Hey, Steve, did you like the breakfast joint this morning?  See, no one can hear us.  Every time we want to talk to someone, we got to like, we got to hand the headphones over.  The only thing, I heard the only thing Steve really didn't like about it was they bring  the breakfast sausage in their asses.  Yeah, thank you.  Did you like the breakfast joint today?  I did.  Well, I liked the food.  The guys were a little creepy.  A little creepy?  Oh, very creepy.  Yeah, they were very, very strange.  Yeah, with their flame hats. 
[00:53:00]  Yes, thank you.  Well, actually, one of them looked almost feminine, except for the Adam's apple.  Wait, you found one guy a little attractive?  No, no, I didn't find him attractive.  I was like, that one's a girl.  I'm like, she's not a girl.  Look at the Adam's apple, you idiot.  You just said she's not a girl.  Oh, jeez.  You see how easy it is to fall into that trap?  Yeah, well.  Before you know it, you've got your hand on the back of a big shoulders.  It was good, though.  So then I go back to my room, and I saw a disaster in my bed. 
[00:53:30]  Disaster.  And I panicked, because last night after the Super Bowl, we were out pretty late.  We ended up on one of these balconies, the Southern Comfort Balcony.  Yeah.  Look at this guy with the Opie and Anthony t-shirt.  What's up, bro?  He's ringing an inappropriate bell as he's walking down the street.  And he has no idea what we're saying, because they're not pumping the show out to the street.  So I go back to my room to crash for a little while, right?  Yeah.  And I noticed, like, what can only be described as shit stains. 
[00:54:00]  Ooh.  Where?  I got it on my bed.  In your bed?  All over one of my pillows, and all over, like, you know, the fitted sheets.  Dude, not just a little, like a lot.  And the only thing I could think of, think about, was, like, last night when I got home  really late from the Southern Comfort Balcony and all that, you know, they had those little  mints.  Right.  The mints on your pillow.  So, you know, I'm getting ready to crash. 
[00:54:30]  I'm watching some more of the Super Bowl coverage on ESPN.  The chocolate.  The five-hour post-game show that they did on ESPN or whatever.  Right.  And I'm like, oh, I'm craving chocolate, so I eat this chocolate thing, and I'm thinking  I ate the whole thing.  I must have not ate the whole thing, and somehow it got in my bed.  Oh, well, maybe when you took a bite, a little piece cracked off, ended up in the bed.  But that's what I don't understand.  A little piece is going to make that much of a mess?  Little chocolate can go a long way.  Little goes a long way. 
[00:55:00]  I noticed once, I had a similar story.  I was eating one of these meal bars, and it was a chocolate chip one, and I'm eating it  in bed.  And I'm kind of sitting up in bed, and one chocolate chip.  Now, it's pretty tiny.  It falls down, and it must have fallen and gone kind of between my legs, where my ass  would be in my bed, and I didn't notice it.  So I go to sleep, and as I hunkered down to sleep, I must have smeared it on the sheet.  And I wake up in the morning, I get out of bed and look, and right where my ass was is 
[00:55:30]  this skid mark of chocolate on my white sheet.  Now, I knew what it was.  I knew I didn't crap the bed.  But I wanted to make sure my girlfriend knew what it was, because how embarrassing would  it be to leave?  She goes to get out of bed, flips the sheets over, and sees a shit stain down the sheets  on the side of her loved one's sleep.  So I had to, you know, I'm trying to be quiet because it's very early in the morning, but  I had to wake her up.  I had to wake her up and go, baby, that's not shit. 
[00:56:00]  I just got to wake up and hear my excuse for why there's a brown skid mark in my bed.  You should have scraped your finger through it and tasted it and said, look, it's chocolate.  And then you realize you were wrong at one shift.  I feel like a silly goose.  Yeah, after I lick it, I pull the sheets down further and see the chocolate chip laying  there, mocking me.  I was convinced that this was left behind from whoever was using the room before me.  They wash the sheets every time.  Yeah, I know.  But I'm like, how did all this get all over the place, right? 
[00:56:30]  So then I, of course, have to scratch it with my, you know, finger.  And I got to do the smell test, because I'm in a major panic.  Why didn't you wrap it in toilet paper and scratch?  Because, you know, crap, it doesn't come off that finger.  That cell will be there for months.  I think I was confident of thinking that most likely it's going to be the chocolate, but  I wasn't sure.  So I was like, all right, I got to scratch to make sure.  And it was.  It was chocolate.  Wow, look at that.  So, hey, that was very nice.  Bravo.  Redhead with the black roots just showed her big, big old can.  I didn't see him.  You missed, Jimmy.  She did very well, because she's getting just slammed with beads. 
[00:57:00]  Literally.  Who does it hurt in the head?  I think that's my brother.  No, it's my brother, Brett.  Your brother, Brett, is a pisser.  Wait, just to finish the story, so I leave the room, and the cleaning lady was right  outside my door, and I took the covers all the way off.  So now you see, I'm not kidding yet, like a foot long, at least, like a foot chocolate  stain, and then it was on the pillow.  And I didn't want to, you know, let her off the hook, so I go, oh, there was an accident  there.  I just want to warn you. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, you told her it was an accident?  Yeah, I didn't tell her what it was.  I had an accident there.  I thought she said it to you for a second.  It really would have been scary.  So that was kind of exciting this morning when I got back from the Petunias breakfast  joint.  Petunias.  Well, now, I go downstairs this morning, and I go out to the, Kenny leads me to the atrium  outside the hotel.  Very lovely area outside.  It's like the courtyard.  Beautiful weather down here.  It's overcast, and it's supposed to rain, but the temperature, you know, when you think 
[00:58:00]  of New York the way it's been the past couple of weeks, to be in 70 degree temperature is  fan-friggin-tastic.  I love it.  So we're sitting outside, and the only people at the table are your brother, Brett, and  Ben.  So we're hanging out, and they're talking about their night last night.  And one thing they bring up, they're kind of going back and forth about how Ben and your  brother got stuck with the $200 bar bill last night.  And I guess your brother Brett had a kick in $100, and Ben kicked in $100, and all of 
[00:58:30]  you guys were drinking.  And all I had to say was, Opie, what the heck?  You make your brother pay for his goddamn drink?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  That's not true, though.  You pull out the Amex.  You pay the tab.  Hold on, hold on.  That's not true.  First of all, I wasn't drinking.  But that doesn't matter.  I'm not talking about how much you drank.  Second of all, I wasn't drinking, and I think Ben pretty much drank all that.  You were most of the bar tab.  It doesn't matter is what I'm saying.  If your men are drinking, it is your responsibility to pull out that Amex and write it off. 
[00:59:00]  It's a business trip.  Dude, to let your brother pay $100 for a night of drinking is completely out of line.  You have nerves.  You don't even hang with us.  You're hanging in a hotel the whole time.  The first night we were here, I picked up dinner for everybody, got no thank yous from  anyone, but whatever.  And then...  They're too busy calling the papers.  And then I looked at my brother last night, and I asked him if he needed cash, because 
[00:59:30]  I didn't know what was going on, because I wasn't drinking last night.  I had a couple...  Dude, I looked at you and asked you if you needed cash.  Oh, my brother just rolled me under a bus.  I know it.  It's amazing, because I looked at him, and I go, dude, do you need cash?  I gave him the cash sign, because I didn't know what was going on.  I did actually...  I got to be fair, and believe me, I'm happy to see you getting booed under the bus, but  he did actually say, do you need cash?  It wasn't very loud, but he did actually get...  Do you need some cash?  And I kind of leaned down, like, what?  He goes, no, no, no.  Nothing, nothing.  He actually did ask.  Thank you.  You did ask.  Because I was just... 
[01:00:00]  I had a couple beers with my buddy Bull, and I was hanging in the back with Norton.  We had our own little thing going.  We had no idea what was going on with these guys.  Ben was drinking like a fish, first of all, and ordering tons of food for himself.  I was just under the impression, if your brother is there, if your brother is there,  there's no way he should have to pull out $100 to pay for a bar tab.  That's all I'm saying, Opie.  I heard them complaining about it this morning.  I'm like, Jesus Christ.  All right, here's what I'm going to say.  Wait, wait, wait.  Dinner on Anthony tonight. 
[01:00:30]  Dinner on Anthony.  I will absolutely take everyone out tonight.  If you're even going to hang with us tonight.  I'm hanging tonight.  Howard Hughes.  We've got Howard Hughes going to his room because he's worried about...  I do have to test fly a plane, but I'll be there.  He's worried about the puke and the scum on the sidewalk, so I don't even know if he's  going to leave his hotel tonight.  But if we're lucky to have Anthony hanging with us tonight, Anthony will pick up the bill.  These are the Hughes brothers.  Anthony Hughes doesn't want to get germs on his hands from going outside, and Greg Hughes  doesn't want to get germs on his hands from pulling money out. 
[01:01:00]  I will.  I am doing it right now.  I am inviting everyone to dinner tonight.  Pick out a restaurant.  I will absolutely go and foot the bill.  Boy, you're going to actually hang with us tonight, Anthony?  Gee, dang.  I said I was going to hang tonight and tomorrow.  He's trashing me, but we haven't even seen him for two days.  I've been hibernating like Steve.  And I flew my brother down here.  Okay.  That is true.  That is true.  How about that airplane seat he has?  Well, that's what I'm going to say.  And see, I'm going to get thrown under the bus for this one, too.  And I did feel guilty. 
[01:01:30]  Last minute, I told my brother, you want to come to New Orleans.  He's always wanting to go to Mardi Gras, right?  So we fly first class, which I've talked about on the air before.  Oh, not we.  It's a little awkward for me personally from where I come from, but, you know, it's a nice  little perk that we have now, right?  Sure.  So by the time it was time to book my brother's flight, because it was a last minute thing.  Voss.  There was no, where?  Jokes for donation sign.  The guy who's walking down the street.  That should be Voss' sign.  It should be Voss.  By the way, what's awkward about flying first class? 
[01:02:00]  It's just, we've talked about it on the air.  It's just, it's a weird thing with me.  I don't feel like I just, it's just weird.  I don't feel like I deserve it and all that from where I come from.  The only thing awkward about first class is that Ben and Steve actually try to make eye  contact when they're walking back through the coach.  Yeah.  It's like, look straight down into your magazine.  Keep going.  I'm not used to the, you know, the first class treatment.  That's all.  I mean, I'm going to try to get used to it because it's very cool.  But yeah.  So by the time I booked my brother's flight to come down here, there was literally one  seat left on the plane. 
[01:02:30]  It was the worst seat.  Oh my God.  That's right.  He sat in the worst seat on the plane.  The worst seat.  Fred, explain where you were sitting.  I think I was sitting in the bathroom, to be very honest with you.  I was in the bathroom.  He was sitting on the toilet.  I'm the only seat that could not recline, but everyone in front of me was more than happy  to recline right in my face.  It's that seat that's right at the back of the plane where the wall is, so you can't recline.  Yeah, he was the seat right next to the bathroom.  On the back wall.  Both bathrooms. 
[01:03:00]  Two bathrooms.  On the back wall where his seat couldn't recline.  The gremlin had a better seat in the nightmare at 30,000 feet episode of The Twilight Zone.  Wow.  And then explain to Anthony who you were sitting next to.  I was sitting next to one of God's special friends that decided that.  God's special friends?  Oh yeah.  He likes to drool and he likes to share a drool with everyone else that likes to sit next to him.  Oh my God.  You had a target here?  The worst seat on the plane.  And his mother sat about a row away from us and she decided to scream across me to yell  at him as he's drooling on me. 
[01:03:30]  Well, you had to sit next to amphetamines in the gene pool when she was pregnant?  One of those disasters?  Didn't she have to tie his shoe or something?  She had to tie his shoe.  She had to tie it over me.  Her breasts were pressed against my face, which wasn't too bad, although she was 77 years  old.  Even better.  And they bought him drinks on the plane too.  He had Bloody Marys out the air.  So keep him calm.  Got to keep him calm, right?  So a little guy, special creature, was drunk too, screaming at people, and every two seconds 
[01:04:00]  you hear the bathroom flush, and then poof, they smelled it.  And I looked down a little aisle and there's little Opie and Anthony and all those guys  with the nice little food.  I didn't even look back once.  And the pillows.  I had a little guilt going on.  I'm like, my brother's back there somewhere rowing.  I call them the rowers now.  Yeah.  They're called the rowers.  And I couldn't look back to see where he was sitting.  In the bilge.  Good.  Honestly.  You want to talk about travel problems?  I understand your seat wasn't good.  But dude, on the way in, there were no oyster egg crackers for my hot cream of asparagus soup. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, my God.  That soup was really good.  No oyster egg crackers.  I understand the last seat on the plane is uncomfortable, but try eating hot soup without  oyster egg crackers.  I don't know why they get so mad at some of those seats, too.  Because I made sure I looked back, and I had my wine glass full of wine for my meal, and  I kind of lifted it up to them in the back and said, hey, guys, how are you doing?  So I even acknowledged them.  And they still were like, eh, got bad seats.  I don't like the fact that there's a curtain between third class and coach. 
[01:05:00]  It used to be a dark curtain, but since 9-11, for security reasons, they now have a kind  of a transparent, opaque blue curtain.  I don't like it, though, because I almost don't want them to look up and see what it's like  up there.  The pleasure in there.  You know, that's nice of you, that you wouldn't want them to see that.  Don't rub it in.  Yeah.  All right, why don't we take a break?  We're running a little late here.  I have a major complaint when we get back.  A major complaint.  A major complaint from Jim Norton when we come back.  Oh.  Do you want to do that?  All right, we're going to do Ant's Martini Steve song.  It's a break.  It's Opie and Anthony broadcast live from Bourbon Street at, what is this place called? 
[01:05:30]  Crazy Horse, right?  Crazy Horse.  Very cool place.  Hot chicks.  Oh, my God.  The chicks are showing up for work.  They're just phenomenal.  Just walking around in their little, little outfits getting ready for the night's festivities.  Yeah, my chick had a fun little story when she went into the bathroom.  Go ahead real fast.  She walks into the bathroom, and the dancers are all getting ready to go on.  So my girlfriend's by the sink putting her makeup on, and this dancer comes running in, 
[01:06:00]  her underwear to her knees, with a tampon in her hand, like as she's running, trying to apply it.  Put it in, and then she sees my girlfriend and just goes, oh!  Oh, she was having, like she kind of felt it coming on real quick?  Yeah, I guess she had a run like, oh!  And our panties were by her knees, and she's running with a tampon.  It's like someone just blew a cannonball through the dam, and you know it's about to burst.  You're going to plug it real quick?  Plug it up.  I hate to be a chick.  But they have to look at that. 
[01:06:30]  And then, you know, we'll go down later and watch the girls dance, and I'm sure she'll point out which girl it was.  And we'll all laugh, looking for the strings.  We'll laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh.  When do they start dancing here?  I don't know.  When do they start dancing?  Pretty soon.  We should get some of the girls on the air.  Yeah, Ben's giving us a thumbs up.  All right, when we get back, Jim Norton has a major complaint.  Major.  Major complaint from Jim Norton when we continue.  You know it's got some flaming shoes The condo pyro would admire 
[01:07:00]  It makes contestants bring in food And it runs the boundary music empire  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire Martini Steve's clothes are on fire  He only buys flaming attire His clothing's like a barbecue 
[01:07:30]  His laundry never needs a dryer If you're selling burning shoes  This drunken Lebanese will fire  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire Martini Steve's clothes are on fire  He only buys flaming attire  Yeah, you know he's got some flaming shoes The condo pyro would desire 
[01:08:00]  If you're with him drinking booze The smoke detector is required  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire  He only buys flaming attire He only buys flaming attire  Martini Steve's clothes are on fire 
[01:08:30]  Martinez's clothes are on fire  Live from Mardi Gras  We're a bunch of scumbags  Oh gosh  They're Vidos  They're Opie  And Anthony 
[01:09:00]  XM202  The Opie and Anthony show  God damn that was close  I think we're back on are we?  Alright Jaime's giving us a thumbs up  It's Opie and Anthony broadcasting live from Bourbon Street in New Orleans  We're at Crazy Horse  The Crazy Horse 
[01:09:30]  Oh my god  That's a mess right there  Big black guy dressed like a gladiator  I gotta tell you  We're on this balcony at the Crazy Horse's balcony over there  We're just  I think we're about a half hour away from having a major bead war with that balcony  Full blown bead war  We're starting to flirt with each other a little bit  Like the girls over there showing their boots  We're throwing some beads nice right now  And they're throwing beads nice back  I guarantee you  Half hour from now it's gonna be an all out war with that balcony you watch  Okay?  I've been firing like fistfuls of beads down at people on the street 
[01:10:00]  Trying to knock drinks out of their hands  This is what I noticed last night from the Southern Comfort balcony  Yeah  We were up there relatively early at the Super Bowl where it wasn't too crazy yet  Oh  And people just take their time with their beads  They point out a girl down below and it's all nice  Yeah  And they kind of gently toss it after she shows her boobs  And everyone's happy and they're applauding, right?  Right  You fast forward about an hour, hour and a half  And it's just an all out pegging that's going on  I want to nail this woman  People's  Oh! 
[01:10:30]  Nice!  Did you hit her?  Yeah, right in the arm  Pulled the fat pig hanging out the car with her?  Yeah, yeah  Good  I nailed her like Kennedy  Almost took out the side window  But what I was saying  And then as the night goes on  You know, it's just an all out pegging that goes on  People are just trying to, you know  Hurt people  Pretty much hurt each other, you know?  Wonderful  Oh, Jim Norton has a complaint  Yeah  What are you upset about, Jimmy?  I don't know  It's just really annoying  When I checked in yesterday  I go upstairs to my room 
[01:11:00]  And in the upper floor of my two-level suite  There was only one soap in the bathroom  I go to take a shower  I'm downstairs in the living room area  I walk up the spiral staircase to the top floor of my two-level suite  And I actually have to get out of the shower  And go back to the sink to get my soap  And I was just disgusted with that type of planning  So you have a two-level suite  Yeah, yeah, don't you?  You know, I'm not going to lie  It hurt  It hurt a little bit 
[01:11:30]  A little bit  Because Norton gets in  And we all had lunch or something  And Norton goes  I'm going to check in  Because his room wasn't ready  So I'm like, you know what?  I'm going to go  And I'm going to go and regroup in my room  Give me a call when you guys want to  You know, meet up with Ben  And my brother and stuff  For the Super Bowl  Yeah  So all of a sudden  Club Sort of Candy Calls  About 20 minutes later  Anthony, the echo  The echo that I heard  Coming from Jim Norton's suite  I'm not even lying  Kenny's like  I think we found a place to watch the Super Bowl  Because that was the big thing yesterday 
[01:12:00]  We didn't know where to watch the Super Bowl  I go, where, Kenny?  He goes  From Norton's two-level suite  Two-level suite  With a huge, you know, big-screen TV  Like two or three couches  Dude, his suite is absolutely ridiculous  And I hear this echo  And I'm getting  I'm not going to lie to you  It hurt  It hurt a lot, actually  And the worst is when he goes  Come up and look at it  And I'm making the X across the throat sign  Like, no  No  Because I think Opie's going to  Kick me out of my suite  Because he's got his brother  They're sharing, like, a bed  And his poor brother's got to sleep on a cot  We're all kidding aside  Because we're having fun down here 
[01:12:30]  It's Mardi Gras and all  Yeah  But Eric Logan and Kevin Straley  Are going to get the nastiest email from me  Starting tomorrow  Uh-oh  And here's the deal  We've been trying to play nice  And trying to, you know  Go with what XM has been telling us  But now  I insist  That Club Soda Candy  Takes care of absolutely  Everything  Everything  Everything  Because I have a whole list of things  That have gone wrong on this trip  Like all the other trips  And one of them  One of them  Is completely unacceptable 
[01:13:00]  As we've  We've  We just  We just took out this car  I just nailed that woman  They're in an SUV  And their windows are open  And we just completely destroy them  And she's all happy  Like waving at us  Yeah  Anyway  It's unacceptable  Candy has to completely take over  From now on  Yeah  And I won't accept anything  Anything different  He's the guy that knows what we need  And what XM has to do  Whatever differences  Or problems they have  With Club Soda Candy  It's time to get the fuck over it  Because  I'll tell you what happened  I checked into my room, right? 
[01:13:30]  Everyone knew  I was bringing my brother down here  Yeah  There's one king size bed  One king size bed  And the room is so small  Which is fine  I don't really care  I'm not a  You know  I'm not a diva  Trust me  But we had to bring up a cot  For my brother to sleep  A cot?  And there's no  There's nowhere to  You know  To place the cot  Nowhere  And everyone knew ahead of time  But this is because  Details aren't being taken care of  Like they should be  Kenny will take care of  Every detail  Kenny was on the road  With Dice for 13 years  He knows this 
[01:14:00]  And it's really starting  To get really frustrating  That XM just doesn't get it  I got ya  You know  I hear ya  And then we called down  There's no other rooms available  But it's F'n Mardi Gras  No  So we got the king size bed  And a cot  I can't even move around my room  At all  I can't  Oh brother  And then  You know  Then to get the phone call  From Norton's two level suite  That could sleep like  I don't know  Ten people comfortably  It hurt a little  I felt so guilty  That I just kind of  Walked around downstairs  In the living room area  In my suite 
[01:14:30]  Going  I'm just sitting on the couch  For 30 seconds  Alright I'm done with this  Let me walk up  Go upstairs  It's nice and dark  In there  I love it  But I'm telling you  One bar of soap  In a suite of that size  The nerve  Is just not acceptable  The nerve  That has to be fixed  So anyway  We're in the nicest hotel  In New Orleans  There really is no better hotel  Than what we're in  It is really nice  It's gorgeous  But you know  But yeah  It would have been nice  To have maybe twin beds  In there  And they're sick of us  Complaining about this stuff  But we keep telling them  We know the solution 
[01:15:00]  Just let us  Kenny's the guy  Oh man  What do we got here  Wow look at this girl  Wow  I can't see  Hold on Tom  I can't see  Tom is like  Tom  Come just grab the girl  Can I grope the  Yeah go ahead  You can say whatever you want  It's satellite radio  He just tried to stick  Two fingers in there  You saw that right  I know  He cannot grope the strippers  That's illegal  No  I don't blame him  For wanting to grope you  But that  I mean that  That's just trying  To make two fingers disappear  And then he just dances away  All innocent  Like what did I do 
[01:15:30]  What's your name  My name's Jolie  Jolie  I'm the exotic schoolgirl  Yes you are  Look she's got a little  Schoolgirl type shirt on  It's recess  It's time to play  Yeah when do you guys  Start dancing  We're trying to figure that out  We're dancing  I just got off stage  Oh really  I'm all hot and sweaty  Wow  Gotta love that accent  Down here in New Orleans  She's a lovely girl  Very nice  Tom what were you  Trying to do  What were you trying to do  Nothing  My girlfriend  Girlfriend she's horrified

[01:16:30]  Don't do a pancreas exam  I gotta tell XM  These cups are genius  These really are fantastic  Nobody's catching them  Every time y'all throw the cups  Nobody can catch them  Well if somebody misses a cup  And it rolls into the gunky water  They just kind of leave it  Excuse me ma'am  It's Tom Pio Paps me up  Let me use my dirty  Alcohol-laced fingers  I'll tell you if you have cancer  Ah there you go Tom  Hey we got someone on the line  That was on the plane  With Jim Norton 
[01:17:00]  To New Orleans  Is that true  Really  Let's see if Todd is still there  Todd what's going on buddy  Hello  Hey Todd  You were on the plane  With Jim Norton  Yeah I was on the same plane  As Jim  And I was sitting back  And coached  Of course he was sitting up  In first class  And I kept on looking  Down the aisle  And the flight attendant  Looked just like Noah  And he came up to me  Spoke with a lisp  And he said  Can I help you sir  And I said  Well I think I might know  The guy sitting up there  In first class  And he had the nerve 
[01:17:30]  To tell me  He said  Hey  If you want to see Jim Norton  You can see him  Meet in town New Jersey  At the Stress Factory  February 11th and the 12th  For more information  You can call  888-541-HA-HA  Or log on to Jim's website  At www.edipullet.com  Wow  Who saw that coming?  Oh my god  That was the best plug ever  The flight attendant said all that  That guy is great  He had me  I was in the plane with him  Like I felt like I was there  And then all of a sudden  I'm blindsided 
[01:18:00]  By a cheap plug  Oh  Stress Factory this weekend  In Eatontown  The new Stress Factory  Thank you sir  For that plug  That was fantastic  What a great plug  That guy gave  Sneaky bastard  Do you have to get back on stage?  Eventually  Eventually?  Look how low  Her little skirt is  That is so cool  You can almost see  Can I see your hiney?  It's so close  To ground zero there  Wow  Very nice  Saturday night  Somebody shot me in the ass  With a BB gun  So I was having people  Check and see if I had a bruise  Are you kidding? 
[01:18:30]  Why would someone  Shoot you in the ass  With a BB gun?  They didn't mean to  They shot the ground  And it ricocheted  And I was just like  Well holy fuck  I was drunk  I didn't feel it  It's terrific  Oh boy  Amazing  What's up?

How awful they are?  Can you say it?  She's making these  Horrendous faces  We talk about his teeth  Right to his face  I'm missing my teeth  When you look at his teeth  Do you think of  Eli Wallach running  While the ecstasy of the gold  Plays  In and out of his teeth?

[01:20:00]  If he did go to the dentist  He'd attack his teeth  With a hose  Like civil rights footage  In 1965  From the other room  They use the same hoses  They're using to clean the sidewalk  Yeah  Tom's teeth  Alright well  Well thanks for stopping by  Just gotta get back on stage  She's beautiful  We'll check you out later  Yes she is hot man  I didn't want to ask  You think she's the one  That had the uh  Uh yeah I was informed  She is the one  That's the one  That is having her time of the month  She's on her period  Oh wow good  Oh wow she's 
[01:20:30]  I think  Wow I thought she was really tall  But  Her spite  Her  Wow  Her stripper shoes  Are about a foot high  That's why when Tom  Pulled his hands away  It looked like he had  Reached his hand  Into a cherry jubilee  Well I didn't know what it was  I'm like hey Tom  Pass me the pistachios  Tom is just the worst  He just doesn't care  Tom doesn't care  He walked right up to that girl  And just grabbed her crotch  Yeah  He's a cannibal  Yeah  He's got some redeeming value  Doesn't he  They let your fingers  Crane just right here  In the airport  I think we gotta say hi

[01:24:30]  Southwest Airlines  The only airline  I really support  Emotionally  Ever since they booted  Those big fat people  Off the plane  Yeah good for them  I'm not talking  These are not people  I'm not saying  That's somebody  That's 300, 325  I mean it's America  We eat good  I overindulge  We all do  You ever see somebody  So fat  It makes you angry  Like you want to  Grab them by their  12XL shirt  How did you get so fat  And I'm talking  In the area  Of 700  750  You know 
[01:25:00]  You ever see  Somebody so fat  They sit on the couch  Their legs  Stick straight out  If you have legs  Like baby arms  Change your eating habits  And of course  We're such a pathetic  Litigious society  You know  You sue for everything now  They're suing  The airlines  You know  We don't think  We should have to  Pay for two seats  Yeah well I don't think  I should be uncomfortable  Because you're repressing  Childhood rape memories  With pure fat  And carbohydrates 
[01:25:30]  You don't want to  Pay for two seats  Fine  Hire a horse trailer  To pull you  To your destination  And hang your fat  Jowls out the back  And chew oats  For 3200 miles  You monster  With no willpower  You look good crowd man  Fine

[01:26:30]  I want to see  I want to see  I want to see  I want to see  I want to see  I want to see  And we're back  With the O, B and Anthony  Program  It's getting ugly  Just like we thought  It would  Damn  That was close  Broadcast live  From Bourbon Street  In New Orleans  At the crazy horse  The beads  Are starting to fly  A little harder  Stop  I came two inches  What happened Jimmy  What happened Jimmy 
[01:27:00]  If you want to throw  Like beads at people  Fine  But you can't  Whiz cups at people  Tom is whizzing cups at people  How many balconies  Have Opie and Anthony cups  Holy shit  Give me my license  I want to throw it at somebody  What a dope  He doesn't disappoint  I'll tell you  I had a big handful  Of green beads  And I came within two inches  Of knocking some girl's drink  Right out of her hand  She was pissed  It is  It turns into a bead war  That's good to wheel a baby around  In the middle of Mardi Gras  That's healthy 
[01:27:30]  Yeah  Isn't that great  Yeah  And look at this lady  She's going to step right over  Wow  That was good  The cup went right in the bag  That that lady was holding up  So  Alright  Tell them not to whiz cups at people  Thank you  Why are you handing me this?  They would like us to mention that  Who are they?  That's the sister club  Of the crazy horse  Okay  They're doing an event  At the gold club  Here in New Orleans  Getting naked  Is not an option  It's the G-string awards  Anthony  Annual four day competition  Begins Wednesday  After Mardi Gras 
[01:28:00]  At the gold club  Cabaret  Very nice  We went there the other night  That's the place  Steve fell asleep  Oh okay  Where you had the chicks  Making out with Steve  And he had no idea  Exactly  You guys want to start  A bead war  With that balcony  Or what?  They got some heavy duty artillery  Do they?  Yeah  We were running low  On the big beads  We got these little ones  Yeah  Well  Why don't we try to talk  About the  The CBS Sunday morning thing  You didn't see it right?  No  For some reason  I was up in time 
[01:28:30]  But I missed it  It was with Charles Osgood  Yesterday  They did  I think it was like  A ten minute piece  On Indecency  Jaime told me  He goes  I hope they're not  Going to turn the music  Up louder  As the broadcast continues  I'm like  Are you insane?  It's only going to get  Crazier and crazier here  It's already louder  The people  There's more people  In the streets  The music's getting louder  So  It's alright  It's Mardi Gras  It's Mardi Gras  It's all about  But man  They're just pumping  The music across the way  So they did like 
[01:29:00]  A ten minute piece  On Indecency  And they talked to you  And I  You hear how loud  That's getting?  I don't know  If they can hear that  At home  But  Wow  That is loud  That is really loud  They're going to  Drown us out of here  There's nothing wrong with that  Oh my god  I've never heard  Music louder in my life  Wow  Alright  Just turn your headphones  Down a little bit  Yeah  That's all I do  Alright  I'll try that  I'm sure they can't 
[01:29:30]  Hear that over the airwaves  Nah  I don't know  It depends on the  Microphones we're using  I'm kidding  But it might  It might not sound as loud  It sounds fine on the air  Right?  Yeah it sounds fine  Anyway so  CBS Sunday morning  They did a ten minute piece  On Indecency  Because it's the year anniversary  Of Jan Jackson  And they ended up  Talking to you and I  Yeah they did it  About two weeks ago  I guess  Came to the studio  It was good exposure for us  But there's nothing really  Earth shattering there  Really  Nothing new  How did they  How did they use our stuff?  They made us sound  Very intelligent  We had intelligent things to say 
[01:30:00]  Wow that's a trick  Of course they had to mention  That we got kicked off the air  For having a couple of half sacks  At St. Pat's Cathedral  And then they showed  Like an inside shot  At St. Pat's Cathedral  Ooh  And it was almost like  A dramatic pause  You know  Really  And then they talked to  You and I  In our new XM studio  In New York  Did we say anything  Entertaining or funny?  Not really  Or they just kind of  Kept it to the facts?  It was kind of boring  But the funny thing about it  They showed some  You know  B-roll of the studio  And stuff  And Rich Voss  Was sitting in  For Jim Norton  All that day  Norton was bummed 
[01:30:30]  That he wasn't  Going to be there  Voss was sitting in  Bragging and saying  Ha ha  I'm going to be on  National TV  In place of Jim Norton  They didn't show  Jim Norton  They didn't show  Voss at all  Not even like  A piece of him  They showed Patrice  For like a half a second  Patrice got some  Air time  That was the day  He came in  With all the glass dildos  So  But I think the clip  Is up on  Foundrymusic.com  And opiananthony.com  If you missed it  From this past weekend  That's all  I'm going to have to see it  Do you want to play  The audio of our part  And try to listen to this?  Yeah that way  I'd be able to hear  A little bit  Alright we got Eric 
[01:31:00]  Back at the studio  Let's see if  This is going to work  Eric whenever you want  Play our part  Of the CBS  Sunday morning thing  Satellite is where  You'll find radio  Personalities  Opie and Anthony  Who were a little  On guard  When we visited  Their studio  And what usually  Happens is we'll say  Something really bad  And outrageous  They'll have the  Sound up on that  And then they'll  Turn it down  And do the voiceover  Of you know  How horrible  They are  Opie and Anthony  Were fired  From a Boston radio  Station in 1997  For an April Fool's joke 
[01:31:30]  We figure we just  Blow the whole thing  Up  And say  That Mayor Menino  Was dead  It's really great  To be here  He wasn't  And in 2002  They were fired  From a New York  Radio station  After taking a phone  Call describing a  Couple having sex  In New York's  St. Patrick's  Cathedral  You know  Morley was obviously  Wrong  I mean  I guess it was  A mistake on a level  But as far as  What we do  It's kind of  Made us bigger  What do you think  About the Super Bowl 
[01:32:00]  Opie and Anthony  Now broadcast  Nationwide on  XM radio  Without any fear  Of the FCC  It gives you  A lot more freedom  It's getting on the air  And being able  To discuss anything  Without worrying  That it's going to  Come back and bite you  From the FCC  It's basically  Talking about adult  Subjects like adults  Talk about it  When they're maybe  At their friend's house  Maybe in the locker room  They sell this stuff  On the street  We know there's  An audience for it  That's why we're doing it  That's why we get paid  A lot of money to do it  With moves afoot  To pump up the fines 
[01:32:30]  On traditional broadcast  TV and radio  The route of  Opie and Anthony  May turn out to be  A road more traveled  Because make no mistake  There's a cultural battle  Underway in America  That could be  Every bit as bruising  As what you'll see  In the Super Bowl  Later today  At least  During the game  Half time  Given what happened  Last year  It's a safe bet  You can let your children  Back in the room  For that  And that was pretty much it 
[01:33:00]  That's it huh  It was pretty much  Uneventful  That's all we got  Yeah  But they made it sound like  That halftime show last year  Was so outrageous  And I still argue  That it really wasn't  That bad  And people gotta relax  And we saw the results  Of it this year  We were talking about it earlier  That it was a really  Boring halftime show  I mean  Seeing Paul McCartney  Sing some Beatles songs  Was cool  Definitely  But the commercials  Were just like  Who cares  You know what  That would be cool  To see  Paul McCartney  Doing that  Like on Saturday Night Live 
[01:33:30]  Or something  The musical guest  You know  As far as the Super Bowl goes  You want it to be  High energy  Or something  It was  It was nothing  Wow  This really got loud  I know  All of a sudden  My mic and everything  Got really loud  It's just  It's just getting  Harder and harder  Broadcast  There are so many people  Below us here  Below the balcony  But you can see  The whole piece  On foundrymusic.com  Or opiananthony.com  It was a cool  Little thing  For the show  And good exposure  For us  I was trying 
[01:34:00]  To pay attention  To the clip  But there was a  What had to be  14 year old girl  Walking by  In front of us  Did you see her?  No  I missed her  She was stunning  Oh my god  What's wrong with you?  No  And Norton  I think threw her beads  Or something  Oh Jesus  Yeah  All lying  Hang me out to dry now  Like no one saw  The hot 14 year old girl  I did not even  Can you hear me now?  I couldn't even notice her  Oh you didn't see her at all?  No no not at all  But I'm glad I threw her beads  I should have made her earn them  Anthony I was thinking 
[01:34:30]  In honor of the CBS  Sunday morning piece  Yes  We've had a lot of requests  For that Charles  Carole thing  Oh I remember that  We played it for the first time  I think last week  Actually when they came in  To film that piece  Yeah we had played that  And I think this would be  A good place to play that  As we try to regroup  And try to figure out  How we're going to do  The rest of this broadcast  Because it is getting  So freaking loud  Here in Bourbon Street  Loud and visually distracting  Look now there's chicks  Dancing down there  I noticed that 
[01:35:00]  That the pieces of asses  Have gotten a lot hotter  Yeah  When we first started broadcasting  It was all just  The middle aged women  Showing there  Just awful cans  But now it looks like  All the younger women  Are finally out  And ready to party  Show  Now some of the hotties  Have shown up  It's getting more  And more interesting  This Charles Carole thing  Basically we found out  That Charles Carole  Who used to be the host  Of CBS Sunday Morning  Before Osgood took over  He had some kind of what  Mistress that he would visit  On the road  Or something like that  Yeah he had like 
[01:35:30]  A steady mistress for years  Up in Montana  And he used to tell his wife  That he was going fishing  In his favorite cabin up there  And he used to go see this  What was pretty much  Amounted to his other wife  Up there in Montana  Right  So as we go to break  I think we're going to play this  One thing I want to say  You guys want to get  Club Soda Kenny  On the street  With a wireless mic  Oh wow  Yeah we should do that right  We can't hear Jim Norton  Jim Norton's mic  Keeps going out  Alright is it good  Yeah you're on again  Okay  We should get Club Soda Kenny  Down there no  Oh talk to some of these people 
[01:36:00]  Sure  After break let's  We'll go down the street  And talk to Club Soda Kenny  He's hanging out with the people  On Bourbon Street  But first here it is  Montana  Frotch rat  We leave you  Now with the sounds of Montana  And me making my face look like a glazed donut  Before I get back to my wife  The sounds of the elusive bearded clan  And me trying to shuck the hell 
[01:36:30]  Out of that bearded clan  I usually don't say things like that  But I'll leave you this Sunday morning  With the sounds of me  Giving her the old pile driver  That's the one where I crouch over her  Push down real hard  In a pile driving motion  So now pictures and sounds of me  And the pile trial  On my mistress in Montana 
[01:37:00]  On the road  The road I prefer  Pictures now of the Hershey Highway  Visited that in Montana  Lots the Hershey Highway  My wife often thought I was fishing  On my trips to Montana  And it's true I was  Here's the sound of the  Trouser trout  Coming out  Of my trousers 
[01:37:30]  As I  Pound some ass  And now the sounds of me  Pounding ass  With my  Montana  Crotch rat  We leave you now  The sounds of me and my mistress  And me shooting a tray up in that piece  And now finally  The sounds of  My mistress  Hobbing my knob 
[01:38:00]  We don't often leave you with the sounds of knob hobbing  I figure this is a good time to leave  And now the sounds of me  And my knob  Being hobbed  Charles Kuralt on the road  Hob  Knob  Now the sounds of  The purple helmet warrior  Going into battle again  Against the dreaded bearded clan 
[01:38:30]  Montana  Crotch rat  Yes the Montana crotch rat  God I wish she shaved  A little personal hygiene in the groin area  So it wouldn't look so much like a possum  Guy and woman  Looks like road kill  Looks like the last time I saw  Woodchuck caught in a combine  All red and brown 
[01:39:00]  And what not  Now the sounds of a woodchuck  Being caught in a combine  Leave you  I mentioned she  Looks like she had  Einstein's head in a leg lock  I should trim that  First time I made love to her  Pulled those panties down  And looked like  Fidel Castro eating a London broil  I used to have a lot of sex in my car 
[01:39:30]  Yes  Gave her a Spanish fly once  I found her on the gear shift  Now the sounds of my girlfriend  On the gear shift  We leave you  Yes  I just wish she was a little better  With the hygiene  It sort of looked like  When you take two big pieces of silly putty  Slap them together  And throw them  On the floor of a barber shop 
[01:40:00]  All pink and hairy  I'm talking about Opie and Anthony  I'm talking about all this lady  And I'm telling all that Opie and Anthony  I'm talking about all  El programa de Opie and Anthony  Live from Marty Cron  También Jim Norton  No se le olvide de Jim  The Opie and Anthony show  XM 202  Calling all freaks  And we're back

[01:41:00]  More pissed off in my life  What happened Jimmy  We got cups  We got to throw down at people  And we got beads  Beads are meant to be whizzed at people  I mean I think that's fantastic  But this fucking idiot  Is throwing cups at people  And it's like  Hey stupid  We're the only ones  With yellow Opie and Anthony cups  Who else has these  They couldn't come from anywhere else  You can't whizz them at people  Not only that  He pegged some  I think it was a lady  In a wheelchair  That was the only thing  That kind of made me not angry  Is that he did hurt a person  In a wheelchair  I was like alright  Well that's kind of funny  But Tom is so just out of it 
[01:41:30]  He's completely hammered  And he's just taking these cups  And throwing them  As hard as you can throw  A plastic cup  He has not seen  It's really funny  Because Norton is losing his mind  I mean  It's a known fact  That Norton just hates Tom  We all know that  And now Tom is just babbling  On a microphone  That's not even working  Did you see that?  Well actually it's turned on  But it's actually rebelling  Against his breath  It shut himself off  It's like Hal  I hear ya  That's right  Good timing  Can you hear me?  What's up Tom? 
[01:42:00]  Can you hear me?  Yes  I don't think Club Soda Kenny  Like me too much  He hates you  Like everyone else  He wants me out of here  Yeah he's going to bounce you  In a few minutes  And Norton asked him like  No you just can't  Throw cups really hard  I hear you  It's my saying  Don't say it again  Oh  Okay  This is going to be a fight  And Norton was like  Well you know  Tom is kind of cool  Or not kind of cool  But I've thought about Tom  And I mean  I don't know  What do you think?  When did I say that?  And I don't know  What's going on  No you just can't  Win cups at people  Because they're going to know  It's us  Are they?  Look at vengeance

Take a little breather  Yeah in a garage  In a car running  Take a nice breather  Take a walk for yourself  Alright thank you Tom  Alright Tom  He's trying to give us the fist  I don't know what he's doing  Kenny will throw him  Don't harass another stripper  Will you?  We're busy doing a broadcast  Kenny will throw him off of this balcony  We've had one chick on the balcony so far  And he's been up here the whole time  Can I stop popping on the microphone  Every time I say paint?  Don't worry about it  I apologize  That's the least of our problems today  I know that's annoying  It's the least of our problems 
[01:44:00]  Is Tara Patrick on the line?  We've got Tara Patrick on the line Anthony  We were supposed to talk to her  What?  Friday I guess  Friday  And we just ran out of show  So we wanted to get her on the air real fast  All right  So she could say hi to us  Tara what's up?  Hey guys  How's it going?  Hi Tara  We have to apologize for Friday  We just ran out of show  You guys got stuck in traffic on Long Island I guess  Huh?  Yeah  Of course  And I think Evan was very very mad at us  But we had no choice in the matter  They cut off the show right at 10 o'clock 
[01:44:30]  So there was nothing we could do  Yeah so don't  Don't have him beat us up or nothing  Hello?  Yeah  Hey guys  She can't hear you  Can you pass it through better?  We're trying to  We're at Mardi Gras  So it's kind of loud  That's probably why  There's so much background noise  Bleeding through  Yeah  Okay hold on  Hold on  I'm having to try again  All right  Is that Evan?  Yeah that's Evan  Oh it was  Tara  All right  You know what 
[01:45:00]  Eric  Just  Eric  You've got to  You've got to get them on hold  Because we can't hear anything  And it's just  It's a clusterf as it is here  Yeah  On Bourbon Street  I guess she's hosting  A Mardi Gras party  In New York City  On Tuesday night  Where?  At Larry Flint's  Hustler Club  Oh wow  Hustler Club  At the Hustler Club?  Yeah  Trenton 11th Avenue  All right  Tara Patrick will be at  The Hustler Club  Doing a Mardi Gras party  In New York City  Tomorrow night  I do believe  I'm so annoyed  That I'm going to be down here  Instead of up there  That's what we could have had up there  One of the hottest porn stars ever 
[01:45:30]  And instead I'm down here  With this drunk  With awful teeth  Licking my head  This timing stinks  He's licked your head twice so far  He licked  If he would have licked my head  The second time  He hit the headphones  Well the first time  He took his hand  And just went like  Got a nice slobber  On his hand  Toxic waist  And then just wiped it  On the back of Norton's skull  So  Disgusting  At least you know  You're not going to get poked  By something like  A toothbrush bristle  That might have been  In his mouth  You know if I can't find  A good escort down here  Maybe I'll lay on the  Bathroom floor  And have Tom  Just lick my chest 
[01:46:00]  It'll be the same thing  I've done in New York  Kind of  And he doesn't understand  That we really  Just don't like the guy  But he loves us to death  He'll do anything for us  He's one of those  Kind of guys  That really has  No real friends  But he has people  That he thinks are friends  And we're amongst  Those people  He actually thinks  We like him  And we're just goofing on him  But the fact of the matter  Is he's a repulsive  Human being  That we want no part of  And for some reason  He has nothing to do  With XM  Right?  No  He's got nothing to do  With us 
[01:46:30]  But he has something  To do with us  Broadcasting down here  I have no clue  How that happened  Yeah how did this  Come about Ben?  Ben why is he  Involved with us again?  Tom got us the actual  Space we're broadcasting from  Tom got us this space  Yeah  And Tom's  You know Tom's very  Hooked up down here  He now works at  Intercom  Because remember  He got fired  From our last station  Yeah  Because when  When the other jocks  Were doing appearances  Tom would get drunk  And run up on stage  And wow I'm Tom  From New Orleans  And then he got fired  As the general manager 
[01:47:00]  Of the station  So now he's selling ads  But I understand  Why we had to deal  With him last time  Because he was  He was part of the station  We were broadcasting  From down here  But wasn't there  Someone else  We could have gone through  To get us a spot here  Let me tell you something  This is a good spot  We got a good set up  It's a great spot  I'm not saying  For some reason  That drunken ass  Has gotten us  A really good spot  And I hate the fact  That that happened  Could we have gotten  Somebody who drinks less  Like William Holden  Kenny is just  Watching him  Like a hawk right now 
[01:47:30]  Kenny's not happy  And I like Tom  I like the guy  But it's like  Stop touching me dude  I'm not joking  I hate being touched  See he's the kind of guy  That thinks it's a joke  Yeah he thinks it's funny  Look so I'll do it again  I understand how radio works  Well the problem is  He's known as the guy  That licks people's heads  And we said that on the air  So of course he wants  To do his thing  He's got to play it up now  He's got to do his thing  You know  Disgusting  We were going to try  To send Club So to Kenny  Down to Bourbon Street  To talk to the people  But I don't even know  If we could possibly do that 
[01:48:00]  It is getting louder  And louder here  Yeah I want Kenny here  Anyway to watch out  Make sure he doesn't  Come over and touch me  I like you Norton  Alright thank you stupid  Norton  We should send him down  There though  We should send somebody  I don't know if we'll hear it  Or anything but  We should talk to some  Of these whores that are  Definitely  What's the most  You would do for bees  Things like that  Kenny  Kenny  Alright Kenny's going down  To the street right now  With the wireless mic  Get Master Poe up here  To watch his area  Get Poe  He'll take Tom's throat out 
[01:48:30]  That was so funny  I guess Poe was giving lessons  On how to make weapons  Oh yeah  We got to talk about that  At Newark Airport  We had about an hour and a half  To kill  So we went to the diner  And Poe's whole thing is  Whoever he meets  He has to pretty much  Tell everyone how tough he is  Okay  Yeah  I noticed this about Poe  And then he has to give  Everyone that comes to the  XM studio in New York  Lessons on how to defend themselves  And one of his things is that  You could kill somebody 
[01:49:00]  Or hurt someone  With just a piece of paper  Improvised weapons  Are his big thing  So he was at the restaurant  Saying how he could make  A deadly weapon  Out of a placemat  Right  You know the paper placemat  You get at a restaurant  Right  And I guess he showed everybody  No but that's the problem  He just says you know  You could pretty much hurt  Or kill somebody  With just a piece of paper  You have to wrap a gun in it  And I was thinking  Well if you're in a confrontation  With somebody  And you don't have much time  To think  I don't think the move  Would be to take a piece of paper  And start folding it 
[01:49:30]  Into a weapon  Folding it  Was that what it is  You could fold it  Into a spike or something  I guess we're going to have to  Maybe have him explain  When we're back into  A normal broadcast environment  When we get back to New York  But he swears that  You can hurt someone  Really bad with just a piece of paper  You know how you hurt somebody  With a piece of paper  You make it a contract  And you put Tom's name on it  And the weird thing  About New York airport  We're at the diner  And you know  You go through security  And they're checking for weapons  And stuff  And they're x-raying everything  Right  And then we sit down  For a nice meal 
[01:50:00]  And we're using  You know  Metal force  Yeah  I'm like  Oh that doesn't seem too smart  Defeats the purpose  Well they're worried  About your nail clippers  And all that stupid stuff  When you're going through security  And then  You get through security  And then there's plenty  Of weapons abound  Yeah then  Poe picks up the plastic knife  And he goes  You could even use this as a weapon  And we're like  Howie goes  You slit their eye  You slit their eye  With the plastic knife  Slit their eye  And Kenny's like  But that's a really small target  You know  Yeah you kind of want to go  For a big target 
[01:50:30]  Exactly  All right  Club soda Kenny  He's down on the street  He's 6'5  He's big and stupid  Wow  He's turning on his mic  I don't even know  If this is going to work  I think the wireless  Is having a problem  Cut the wireless  It ain't going to happen  Oh wait  We got to turn  We got to  I don't know  If this is going to work  We got to put the  Hey what's up  Oh we got it  We got  Another thing  That's not going to work today  Don't tell him  It's not working  Just keep looking at him 
[01:51:00]  Smiling  And he'll let him  Talk to a few people  Yeah do that  Do that  Just let him go  He's hysterical  He's wandering around  No one can hear you stupid  Look he's talking to me  Let's throw beads at him  Oh you just hit that guy  In the head  Very close  All right  Kenny  Kenny's wandering around  Kenny good job  Keep thumbs upping him  I just gave him a thumbs up  He's walking over  To a beautiful girl now  And she's talking  And we have no idea  What she's saying  Because the wireless  Doesn't go far enough  I'm going to try to hit him  With these beads  When he comes back  I got a big fistful 
[01:51:30]  Of colorful  Festive beads  Girls on a bicycle  Oh watch  Let me hit Kenny  Oh got him in the arm  All right  Well that's another thing  That's not going to work today  I swear to God  It wouldn't be a broadcast from Mardi Gras if it wasn't a clusterfuck 
[01:52:00]  Wow look at that girl  She's completely topless with her boobies painted  She's got that pink hair  Very nice  Very big breasts  Are we getting video of this stuff?  Oh there's one  At Clutch and Speed  Where's Martini Steve  Is he filming this stuff?  No  He is filming this  I think there's a gang rape going on down there  Yeah it's kind of crazy 
[01:52:30]  When a girl like that  You know  Walks by completely topless  I mean guys swarm around  And it gets a little crazy down there  Yeah  Looks a little risky for the girls  But  That's what it's all about  It's a good look  It's a good look  Wow those are big pants she got painted  Yeah let's see if we can knock her drink over  There you go whore  Whore  All right  Nice people just enjoying the festivities  Oh did I ever tell you about my friend  When I used to hang out with this bodybuilder named Stanley  I was 13 and his brother Mike  Is he real or was he like Helen? 
[01:53:00]  He was a made up one  He would come in a cape and rescue me  No me Stanley  Stanley was like 25 and Mike was like 13 my age  We would all play video games together  It was like a molesting waiting to happen  But Stan was just a nice guy  But Michael was a sociopath  So we would ride around and throw things at people  And one time he had  We used to like get like cool whip cans  Cool whip buckets  Oh right  And put hot motor oil in them  And I remember we were driving by some guy without his shirt  And Mike goes  Hey Stanley let's leak some motor oil in it  And throw it on his chest  And we drove by this chick one time 
[01:53:30]  And they had some Chinese food mustard  And Mike goes  Hey whore have some mustard  And he threw it at her  And he smashed it right in the face  Chinese mustard  One time we were in a pickup truck  And they had a couch in the back  So he lit the couch on fire  And pushed it out onto the highway  Hoping somebody would crash into it  And be killed  What an ass  Hey whore have some mustard  My favorite thing ever  What an absolute ass  That's kind of what this is like  Winging things down  You think I can hit her cup out of her hand  Or that guy's cup  Damn I'm short 
[01:54:00]  That's stunk  You're out of practice  I love the looks you get from these people  After you hit them with the beads  Oh  Look at that  Those girls look like they washed up on a Phuket beach  A lot of those going on  The festivity is really really getting underway now  When do they shut down the traffic  Because there's still a lot of cars driving through here  We keep throwing things in their windows  Hoping to knock out the driver  So he hits the gas  And runs over a crowd of people  Right in front of us 
[01:54:30]  I think we should take another break  All right  And we'll regroup  Eric just play whatever you want going into break  Because I can't even hear myself  It's getting louder and louder  What Ben?  You're cool?  All right  It's Open Anthony broadcasting live  From the Crazy Horse  On Bourbon Street  In New Orleans  Check this out and we'll be back  Crypt of the Night  This is about Christopher Reeve  Oh they got the same version  I took a ride one day 
[01:55:00]  My horse to ease my troubled mind  I hadn't landed a decent road  Since I met somewhere in time  I couldn't get a job  Unless I wore a blue and red suit  I felt there's nothing I could do  Yeah  Then suddenly my horse stopped short 
[01:55:30]  That stupid thoroughbred  My hands were tangled  And the bright eye landed  Right on my head  I can tell that I had done some major harm  Cause now I can't feel  My legs are my arms  If I fell off my horse  Would you still call me Superman  I broke two vertebrae 
[01:56:00]  And I'm never gonna walk again  The only things I move are my lips and eyes  Cause I'm paralyzed  I once was strong  But now I'm weak  I need a straw  So I can eat  I took for granted 
[01:56:30]  How easily I used to get around  I drool and stare  Near in my chair  And I can't even brush my hair  And when I try to speak  I make these gargling sounds  If I fell off my horse  Would you still call me Superman  Now I breathe through a poop  Attached to an oxygen can  I sound like Blair's  Cutting Jerry  From the facts of life  Cause I'm  Where we are  It's my life 
[01:57:00]  Yeah  Music  Thank you. 
[01:57:30]  If I fell off my horse, would you still call me Superman? Will you please wipe my butt, cause I no longer have use of my hands. They hope I walk again if I exercise, but I'm paralyzed.  Yeah, if I fell off my horse, would you still call me Superman? I used to drive a Porsche, but now I have a handicap van. I'm surprised my wife's not banging other guys, cause I'm paralyzed. 
[01:58:00]  I used to drive a Porsche, but now I'm paralyzed. 
[01:58:30]  They are funny, entertaining, and don't take themselves too serious.  It's called sarcasm! Hello, exactly!  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  XM202, the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Why is Mikey thinking physics? 
[01:59:00]  That's Kenny's life.  And we're back to the O.B. and Anthony program live from Mardi Gras, and we're broadcasting here. Why?  At this point?  Because it's a party, O.B.  Because it's a huge party. We're at the Crazy Horse. We're on a balcony. It's just getting crazy. And now it's starting to rain.  Yeah, the rain has come. Some of the people scattering to the sides of the road.  It almost feels like an act of God just to clear the shithole out. 
[01:59:30]  Watch your way, the stink.  Well, we got Big and Stupid on Bourbon Street right now. He's on the wireless mic.  Is it going to work now?  Hey!  Club Soda Kenny is on the street, and he's going to talk to some people. Let's see if this works.  Jaime said it's going to work.  Am I good?  I'm on the street. I'm going to talk. Hey, talk on the radio.  Hello.  Say something about Mardi Gras.  Mardi Gras rolls.  Where are you from?  Iowa.  Iowa farmer. See ya.  You want to talk on the radio? Say hello. 
[02:00:00]  Hi.  Yeah.  Hello.  I just nailed her in the face.  Holy shit.  Hey.  Tell me shit.  Hi.  I have no voice.  Say you're a hug chick.  I'm a fucking hungover chick.  He's just mugging people.  All right. I'm finding a lot of people. Everybody's throwing stuff at me.  Yeah. That's not cool.  He is just mugging people.  It'll be an improvement.  Let me talk to some more chicks. 
[02:00:30]  I hit her right in the face.  Here. Say hello on the radio.  No.  Hi.  The trick is to hit the girls he's talking to.  Yeah.  He's going to say Kenny right on the head.  Come on. Say hello on the radio.  Oh, God.  That just hit the file.  Anthony just nailed the microphone.  Jimmy, Florida.  Good for you.  Good for you.  Hello.  Come on. Talk to someone.  Hello.  Hello.  God damn.  Hey, you want to say something from...  I can't say tonight. 
[02:01:00]  What?  Oh, you're an asshole.  What is he doing?  He's still fucking throwing them at people.  You want to say hello on the radio?  Oh, up here.  All right.  You've got to hit the people in the face that he's talking to.  All right.  I'm going to find some more people.  All right.  Here's another fact.  I'm going to start getting live from Burnt Street.  Hi.  Am I ready?  Hit her in the face.  What's up?  What's going on?  I'm going to see you guys here in New York.  You're listening now on the XM?  Absolutely.  Where are you from?  New Orleans. 
[02:01:30]  Go for you.  That's right.  Here you go.  Have some mustard, boy.  Texas.  Yes.  Texas.  Texas.  Yeah.  Did you show anybody your tits yet?  Not yet.  No.  No.  She did.  She did.  No.  No.  All right.  Coastal to Kennedy is getting completely attacked by the beads.  Show them your tits.  I need some good beads.  Don't throw your beads.  Go ahead.  Get us out of this, Jaime.  Thank you.  We have crappy beads to give out.  That is really funny. 
[02:02:00]  All the sounds you were hearing were the beads hitting the girls in the face.  As Coastal to Kennedy is trying to interview them.  It's starting to rain pretty bad out there.  It's turning into like a wet t-shirt contest now.  That's not a good thing.  No.  And it's getting louder and louder.  We could try to do the Michael Jackson audio thing.  Oh, yeah.  Geraldo talked to Michael Jackson.  I was, of course, you know, sequestered in my room, Opie, for the past couple of days that we've been here.  And I was watching a VH1 thing on Michael Jackson. 
[02:02:30]  And they had video of him from private moments.  It was this videographer that just used to be, I guess, one of Michael's friends and would videotape some of the stuff.  Did you see that, Jaime?  Martin Bashir.  That's the one that got him in all the hot water.  There is a video of him dancing with Lil' Webster up in some room.  And he was doing Michael Jackson dances with Webster.  It was the creepiest thing ever.  Because Lil' Webster's grabbing his crotch and dancing around. 
[02:03:00]  And that whole thing.  Remember when he kind of had a relationship with Brooke Shields?  He took her to an awards show.  But instead of taking Brooke up on stage with him when he won an award, he took Lil' Webster with him.  That whole thing ended.  And I never knew this.  Because he tried to check into a hotel with Webster as father and son.  And that's when Webster's parents went, no, that's it.  You're not hanging out with Michael Jackson anymore.  This creep is trying to check into a hotel with Lil' Webster. 
[02:03:30]  Why?  He should have grabbed Webster and had Webster carry a little thing that he churned.  G-gong, g-gong, g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g.  And music comes out, have a cup, and people throw money into it.  That little creep.  He should have molested Webster with a little fat-faced tease.  But that is what Michael Jackson is.  A predator.  Yeah.  Oh, what is this?  Oh, good.  That's the police department.  Wow, people get out of the way.  Tooling down the middle of Bourbon Street.  Wow, these guys don't even slow down for people.  Look at this.  Why is Grady from Sanford and Son hanging out the back of that truck? 
[02:04:00]  I've seen more Grady's from Sanford and Son in this city.  Well, do you want to try to play some of the audio from the Geraldo interview?  Yeah, Michael Jackson seems to go on Geraldo a lot on Fox News  because Geraldo's actually supporting him.  And you can't find another outlet for someone to kiss his ass.  It's not really stupid on Geraldo's part.  Geraldo knows Michael Jackson's going to come on.  It's going to give him ratings.  For a second, if you think Geraldo supports Michael Jackson,  you're on drugs.  Geraldo knows the guy's a predator. 
[02:04:30]  Geraldo's got kids.  Would he let his kids stay with Michael Jackson?  I'd like somebody to ask him that.  Well, we could just try to play some of these clips and see what happens.  We've got Geraldo talking to Michael Jackson  about the history of the raids at Neverland Ranch.  You want to go to that clip and see what happens here?  Nice.  All right, let's play this.  Sadly for Michael Jackson, Neverland Ranch,  this fantasy world he created back in 1988  to celebrate his vision of himself  as a kind of modern-day Peter Pan  has too often been sullied by harsh reality. 
[02:05:00]  Twelve years ago, when the King of Pop was performing overseas,  this 2,800-acre spread in a remote section of Sennabarver County  was raided for the first time.  Since then, law enforcement officials  have often come bursting through these lovely gates.  Sometimes, the defense argues,  they've come just to make a point  and perhaps also to make some news.  Example, the widely covered December 3rd raid  to obtain a sample of Michael's DNA,  a sample they obtained without any hoopla at all in private 
[02:05:30]  the very next day.  In the words of one legal pundit,  Neverland has been searched more often  than the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.  Neverland is as unique as the man who built it,  a shrine celebrating an innocent ideal  that over the years has been crushed  and sullied by allegation, rumor, and innuendo.  Now, as the current case against him unfolds,  Michael Jackson knows for a certainty  that the district attorney will spin  every child-friendly attraction,  from the statues, to the rides, 
[02:06:00]  to the exotic animals,  into a kind of malevolent child trap.  And this despite the fact that over the years,  thousands of mostly inner-city children  have enjoyed this place without incident.  Yet he knows that what you see in this place,  innocence or evil,  is in the eye of the beholder.  Oh, are you kidding me?  Do you hear this guy defending a belt  just because every child that went there  wasn't molested?  Yeah.  Then none of them were.  Evil is in the eye of the beholder,  or in this case,  evil is in the brown eye of a child. 
[02:06:30]  Scumbag, Geraldo.  Yeah, there's Geraldo backing him up.  Like the police are doing this for publicity.  No, I think if you pay off a child's family  to not go to court about molestation charges,  I think there's a problem there.  I think if you're sleeping with children  and you're a 40-year-old man,  yeah, I think there's a problem there.  I think Geraldo is doing this for the reasons he gave,  for the police breaking into that place. 
[02:07:00]  For publicity.  Of course.  How could the guy...  Self-respecting, that's why.  I was going to say,  how could any self-respecting guy?  The guy obviously has no self-respect.  Geraldo, he's a media whore.  He's doing this just to get ratings.  And I think Michael Jackson's pretty screwed.  Jury selection, I guess, is still going on.  That's going to be another circus when the trial starts.  I was reading in the paper  that it's costing like $40,000 a day  to put this case on.  That's great.  Out there in California.  $40,000 a day because of all the security 
[02:07:30]  and all that that they need to do  to get the case rolling.  You want to try another clip here?  Want to try Jackson's life at the ranch with his kids?  All right.  It's from Geraldo's exclusive interview  with Michael Jackson.  Our interview was conducted  at a friend's recording studio  on the 19th of January.  Here it begins.  So how are you doing?  I'm doing fine, Geraldo.  How are you?  Despite whatever goes on in the world,  you feel okay? 
[02:08:00]  I'm doing very well.  Thank you.  You know, it was wonderful  seeing you with the children.  That, I think, is the real Michael Jackson  that has not been seeing you  with your own children,  one in diapers,  the other two toddlers.  I don't know how you manage without a nanny.  Well, I enjoy taking care of my children myself.  It's fun.  That's why I had them  so I could take care of them.  And it's just great relief for me.  You know, it's pleasure.  It keeps me happy and laughing.  And they're wonderful,  sweet, innocent children.  They really are.  I saw you as kind of the arbitrator 
[02:08:30]  between the Nickelodeon channel  and the Disney channel there.  You know,  you get some really difficult problems  to solve there.  Yes.  But you have such a kind of a normal life there.  It's sweet to see.  Thank you.  They bring me that.  Tell me what the children mean to you.  Your own children.  They mean,  it's hard to put into words  because they mean everything.  The way he would explain  how your children make you feel.  I mean, they're the world for me.  I mean, I wake up  and I'm ready for the day 
[02:09:00]  because I give them breakfast.  I change diapers.  If they want to read,  we do a lot of reading.  We play hide and seek.  We play blindfold  and have a wonderful time with them.  And you can create a world  that at least begins to seem normal.  I mean,  they don't know any other world,  obviously.  I do my best for sure.  So that is obviously a priority to you.  Yes, of course.  I want to be the best father  in the world, of course.  Do they know who you are 
[02:09:30]  or what you mean to people?  Yes, they do.  They've been on tours with me  and limousines  and I'm on a sea of fans.  Do they like it?  Yeah, they find it exciting.  They want to get on stage.  They bug me  to go on stage with me.  So pretty soon  I'm going to take them on with me  and let the world see them  for the first time.  They're going to say,  Daddy, I want to go home  and watch Nickelodeon?  Probably.  Probably.  They do that too?  Yes.  Can I say,  the reason Michael Jackson  has children 
[02:10:00]  is the same reason  that drug addicts  grow their own pots?  For your own head.  Yeah.  Oh, is that awful?  And Geraldo just defending him.  Oh, to see you with the children.  That's the real Michael Jackson,  isn't it?  Yeah, well,  that's what everyone's saying  and that's why  there's going to be a trial.  With the children  is a real Michael Jackson.  Changing diapers?  Is he talking about his own kids  or the blood he's got to change  out of his victims?  What an awful, awful man.  Yeah. 
[02:10:30]  Geraldo backing him up,  trying to present him  in a normal light.  Oh, isn't that the only type  of normalcy you see  as a person?  Are you kidding me?  The guy is going on trial,  not because it's the first time  it happened,  because this just happens  over and over again.  Yeah, I like reading with my kids.  Yeah, we like reading together.  Yeah.  See, there is nothing wrong.  Read this paragraph.  There's nothing wrong  with man-boy love.  He's got those magazines 
[02:11:00]  with the fingerprints of kids  and him on it.  Child porno magazines.  Of course he loves reading  to the kids.  It's a new pop-up book  called Snitches Get Stitches.  This is what happens  when you tattle  on Uncle Michael.  All right, well,  it's my new  sucking spell book.  See, dick, run  right into your mouth.  All right, let's try  another clip here.  Jackson talking about  his private life.  I think it's track six there, Eric. 
[02:11:30]  Let's listen to this  from the exclusive interview  with Geraldo Rivera,  Michael Jackson.  When you have  such intense scrutiny,  how do you live  any kind of normal life?  How do you, you know,  have any fun  outside of your own property?  I don't.  I go off property sometimes,  but not all the time.  I create my world  behind the gates, you know,  because I can't go  to the local movie theater  down the street  or the local park  down the street  or go pick up ice cream  at the market,  the corner store.  So you want to create  that world behind the gates. 
[02:12:00]  And that's what  I try and do.  It's not just for me  if I could share  with my family  or friends  or whoever I do.  And that necessity  for some privacy  drives all these  crazy rumors  and speculations.  It's a difficult  balancing act  that you have to endure.  Yes, yes.  Part of what comes  with celebrity.  But you're not  complaining, are you?  I don't.  I try to, you know,  rub it off.  Not that I'm,  I don't know what  I'm the king of.  I think you're 
[02:12:30]  getting shot at, maybe.  No, no, no, no.  The king of journalists.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  You know why  he can't go down  to the local movie theater?  Because they don't show  Chicken Hawk at Lowe's.  You have to order it  off the internet.  Baggot.  He is  just despicable.  And to have  Geraldo  in his corner  cheering him on  on a very popular  news network,  the guy knows  what he's doing.  He's getting the ratings.  Michael Jackson thinks 
[02:13:00]  he's going to be vindicated  because Geraldo Rivera  agrees with him.  Yeah.  Give me a break.  And you know,  he brought up  an interesting point there.  It seems like  Michael Jackson says  he can't act like  a normal person  outside of the gates  of Neverland.  He feels alienated  and out of place  outside those gates.  So I think he actually  feels he can do  whatever he wants.  If I can't live  with your laws  outside my gates,  then I'll make up  my own inside.  And whatever he does  inside his own gates  is his world,  you know? 
[02:13:30]  His whole  bullshit Peter Pan  thing that they  keep bringing up.  And I think he  honestly feels  he can do  whatever he wants  in there.  And what he's been  doing is molesting  children.  And man,  after this trial,  from what I've seen,  it looks pretty grim  for the guy.  And I think  Michael Jackson  in prison  is going to be  some of the most  entertaining stuff  to speculate on  ever.  It's going to make  for some great  radio bits,  I'll tell you.  That is some big  prisoner telling  Michael to moonwalk  into his dick.  Yo, man, 
[02:14:00]  get on your knees  and beat it.  All right,  we got another  cut here.  Michael Jackson  talking about  children.  Another what?  Cut?  Oh, a cut.  Michael Jackson  talking about  children in distress,  Anthony,  from the Geraldo  Rivera exclusive  interview.  Let's listen to this.  Michael Jackson  sounds a lot  like shitty music  across the street.  Michael Jackson  sounds like a drunk  yelling Opie's name  from the street. 
[02:14:30]  Are they drinking  back in New York,  too?  Yeah, I think  they're having a  Mardi Gras party  over there.  What track?  Sorry.  Track seven.  Okay, here we go.  Children in distress.  Here we go.  So what is it  about children  in distress?  You mentioned  the tsunami relief  effort.  What is it?  Is it your own  fatherhood that  motivates that?  Caring and reading  the Bible,  learning about God,  Jesus, love.  Jesus said,  bring on the  children,  imitate children,  you know,  be like little 
[02:15:00]  children,  and to take care  of others,  take care of old  people.  And we were  raised with those  values.  Those are very  important values  in my family  and I.  We were raised  with those values  and they continue  strong in us  today.  Raised with  those values.  Michael,  he didn't say  children in distress.  He said,  why do you have  children in this  dress?  Very good.  So,  we can try  one more clip  here.  It's kind of  hard to,  I can't even 
[02:15:30]  hear these clips  really.  It's so loud.  How about  Jackson?  I think this  is cut 14.  Jackson,  Elo's daughter,  Jackson,  are you talking  about?  Or Michael?  Michael Jackson.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  Elo was telling  me that he's  starting to email  pictures of his  little daughter  to Norton  over and over  again,  like every day.  Does he just  mean regular  mail and he  calls it email  because it's  Elo sending it  or does it  mean the actual  computer email?  I never got  the,  what is Eric's  email address?  I never got  an email from him.  Wow.  There's another  stripper going to  work,  I guarantee it. 
[02:16:00]  What's written  on her ass?  I can't tell.  Hot ass or  something like  that?  Holla?  Oh.  Hottie.  Hottie bitch  or something like  that.  Wow.  Yeah, she's got  to be going to  a club.  It looks like  she's a stripper  going to work.  Much too hot  to be walking  with this rabble.  Why don't we  go to track  14, Eric.  This is Michael  Jackson talking  about giving  to the children.  Yeah.  Giving to the  children.  Your homes,  I mean for all  the grandeur of  Neverland,  your home is  quite modest  and your  personal style. 
[02:16:30]  I don't see  any bling  for instance.  How come?  How can I have  a big diamond  thing instead of  Michael?  Because I'm  modest in my way  and if I had it  on I would  probably give it  away from the  first kid who  would walk up  to me and say  wow I like  your necklace  here.  You can have  it.  Because when  I was little  stars like  Sammy Davis,  Fred Astaire,  you know,  Gene Killen,  if I admired  something they  were wearing  if I simply  said God  I love that  shirt you're  wearing  they would  give it to  me.  So I was  taught that  you know  that's part  of a show  business trait  you know  to hand it 
[02:17:00]  over.  Despite the  glare of the  media attention  and even the  day that I was  there and you  invited the  inner city kids  there,  what's it like  to have a kid  there?  Why do you  do that?  I wanted to  ask you that  question that  day but I  pose it to  you now.  Why?  Why do you  when you  yeah when you  see those  kids tell me  what's going  on?  Because I  think I  traveled the  world over  eight times  around the  world and  I go to  hospitals.  I do as  many hospitals  and orphanages  as I do  concerts.  But of  course it's  not covered.  That's not  why I do it  for coverage. 
[02:17:30]  I do it  because it's  from my  heart.  And there  are so many  children in the  cities who've  never seen  the mountains,  who haven't  been on a  carousel,  who haven't  petted a  horse or a  llama,  who've never  seen them.  So if I can  open my  gates and those  gates open and  that bliss,  explosion of  screaming and  laughter from the  children and  they run past the  breeze, they run  on the rides, I  say, thank you  God.  I feel I want  God's smile of  approval, you  know, because I'm  doing something that  brings joy and 
[02:18:00]  happiness to other  people.  He's delusional.  And I know what  happened, by the  way, because he  was saying that if  a child wants  something, he'll  give them like a  shirt or whatever.  So the child must  have said, gee, I  really admire your  underpants and all  that stuff that's  built up in your  testicles.  I sure would like  it.  And I felt I had to  give to the  children.  I felt like I had  to give.  He didn't have his  shirt on his back,  or should I put  some seeds on  it?  And he goes, I've  been around the  world eight times,  and I visit  children, you  know, in homes and  in hospitals and  orphanages. 
[02:18:30]  It's like a Home  Depot for him, the  world, just going  around various  plates, like a  smorgasbord.  Well, the  beautiful thing  about going to  Africa is all  you've got to do  is put a little  chocolate on your  mule and 30  kids will run  over.  The hungrier they  are, the happier  he is.  Oh, man, you're  a mess.  Good luck,  Michael.  We've got one  more track.  It sums up the  whole thing.  It's the exclusive  interview with  Geraldo Rivera.  Michael Jackson,  it's his statement,  Anthony.  When you said it  sums up the whole 
[02:19:00]  thing, I thought  you meant a  money shot on a  hairless little  face.  It's Michael  Jackson addressing  the charges against  him.  So, let's go to  this.  This is track  18.  Finally, you  know, we  studiously avoided  the case.  We've not talked  at all about the  case that's been  and you're under  this gag order.  I know that you  have received the  permission from the  judge to read a  statement.  Yes.  You know, I hate  to end an interview  that way, but if  you'd like to read  that statement, I 
[02:19:30]  think it's important.  Sure.  In the last two  weeks, a large  amount of ugly,  malicious information  has been released  into the media about  me.  Apparently, this  information was  leaked through  transcripts in a  grand jury proceeding  where neither my  lawyers nor I ever  appeared.  The information is  disgusting and  false.  Years ago, I  allowed a family to  visit and spend  time in Neverland.  Neverland is my  home.  I allowed this  family into my  home because they  told me their son 
[02:20:00]  was ill with cancer  and needed my  help.  Through the years, I  helped thousands  of children who  were ill or in  distress.  These events have  caused a nightmare  for my family, my  children, and me.  I never intend to  place myself in so  vulnerable a position  ever again.  I love my community  and I have great  faith in our justice  system.  Please keep an open  mind and let me have  my day in court.  I deserve a fair trial  like every other  American citizen. 
[02:20:30]  I will be acquitted  and vindicated when  the truth is told.  Anything else you'd  like to say?  No, no.  Yes, there's  something.  I would love to  have the public's  prayers for my  children and myself.  Okay, brother, you  got it.  All right.  Thank you.  Yeah, pray for him.  Yeah.  Pray for your  victims.  And the poor kid  with cancer, that's  how Michael got him,  by the way.  Yeah.  He said, look, you  see these two things?  There's chemo in  them.  Put this in your  mouth and drink your 
[02:21:00]  medicine.  Here's a magical  cure.  It's Jesus' use.  He called up the  Make-A-Wish  Foundation.  He's like, yeah,  you got anyone with  washboard abs who's  under 12 who coughs  a lot?  I mean, this is  horrible stuff, clear  stuff that's leaking  out.  Talk about his  leaks.  You think he's  going to get off?  I mean, he's gotten  off, obviously.  Put up, Bob.  I think this time, if  there's any truth to  the allegations against  him, then he'll go 
[02:21:30]  away.  I think unless it is  completely false and he  can prove it, he's got  to go to jail.  You know, from the  horrible, disgusting  things that have leaked  out, you know, he's got  to...  It sounds like you're  talking about the O.J.  Simpson trial.  You know that, right?  I know.  This is all the same  stuff that everyone  talked about when O.J.  committed those two  murders.  It seemed obvious that  he was guilty, but  money has a strange  way of really distorting  the justice system.  But he's done it 
[02:22:00]  already.  This is like if O.J.  hooked up with another  blonde and she was  found dead on O.J.'s  doorstep with a slit  throat, O.J.'s blood  all over the place  again.  It would be a little  hard for him to  explain it again.  Michael Jackson's  already done it once.  He's paid it off.  Now it's happening  again.  I think this is really  difficult for him to  explain it away like,  you know, he's being  set up again.  You think they got  some just great  evidence they're going  to finally...  I think they do. 
[02:22:30]  I think Michael Jackson,  who now is saying he's  never going to put  himself in this  position again.  Why didn't he say it  last time?  He already spent  millions of dollars  for one kid that he  supposedly molested  and paid him off.  Why wouldn't he after  that instance knock  all this crap off of  sleeping with kids and  inviting kids over?  And if you're going to  invite kids over, he  tries to put in one  category, inviting sick  kids over to play at  an amusement park that  he owns, in the same  boat as him sleeping  with kids in his bed  and playing games.  It's not the same 
[02:23:00]  thing.  If you invited sick  kids over to play at  your house, at your  amusement park, that's  fine.  You have people there,  doctors, nurses,  whatever other staff is  appropriate to take care of  the kids, to chaperone  them, you're never alone  with the kids.  That's taking care of  kids.  If he really is this guy  who just wants to take  care of children, that's  fine.  Put all these things in  place, especially after  you've been accused once  already.  But he didn't.  He's still dragging them  up to his bedroom with a  secret doorbell and  locks on the doors, and  that's why he's screwed  again.  Why? 
[02:23:30]  Because he did it.  Because he's guilty.  Because he's a pedophile,  a molester, and a  predator.  Allegedly.  No, I'm saying  definitely.  I know, I'm just  throwing that in.  We'll see if he  sues me.  Go ahead, Michael.  Sue me.  Sue Opie for saying  that.  I dare you.  Yeah.  All Opie would have  to do is shave a little  hair off his ass and  say, look, Mike.  I like Opie.  He's blonde.  Let's all relax.  Yeah, he would really  like you.  Let's all relax.  All right, well,  wow, look at this thing.  Guy or girl, can't even  tell from here.  I don't know what that 
[02:24:00]  is.  I don't know.  We're live at  Mardi Gras, Crazy  War, Bourbon Street.  It's raining.  People are getting  drunk.  It's raining.  It's a mess.  Yeah, it is.  But I like the smell  that's now wafting up  from the steaming  street from the rain.  Mmm.  That's nice.  That was actually  Tom talking.  So what are these guys?  This guy's got, like,  they got doctor scrubs  on and he's got a big  dildo sticking out of  his pants and he's  beating girls with it  as they walk down the 
[02:24:30]  sidewalk.  He just beat the ass  of that hot blonde  right there.  That is wonderful.  Pretty much anything  goes at Mardi Gras.  We've seen that.  I think when we come  back we should start  a bead war with that  other balcony over  there.  You want to start  whaling something?  We better get some  artillery because they  really have a lot of  big heavy beads.  We got, like, little  BB beads.  The girls don't even  want them.  I think we've ran out  of beads.  Yeah.  So we'll continue in  just a bit.  Eric, get us out of  here.  Live from Mardi Gras. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, gosh.  Oh, man.  They're Ritos.  They're Opie.  And Anthony.  I was, I thought  of you guys at my  parents' house for  Christmas.  Thanks, Peter.  The very Brady  Christmas was on from  88.  And it was just, it  was so funny because  Peter and Bobby were  sharing the living room  and Peter had on a  nightshirt.  And I'm like, who  wears a, whoever in  this, at least from  like after 1850, has  worn a nightshirt.  A nightshirt.  And you can't look at  Robert Reed, do  anything without 
[02:25:30]  noticing how gay he  is now.  The hand on the  hip.  He is very gay.  The left hand being  this while the right  arm is akimbo on the  hip.  You cannot notice.  Peter!  Peter!  Why don't you slip this  sexy little nightshirt  on, Peter?  Because it's no fun  unless I can pull  something up in the  back.  That's why all the  Brady boys wear the  nightshirts.  He just gave up  acting straight.  Because I think in  the original series, 
[02:26:00]  you can, I don't  think you can tell at  all, but you're  right.  These later episodes  and specials that  came out, he just  said, ask for it.  I am what I am and  here it is.  Those scenes where  he's laying in bed  with Carol at the  end of the show,  doing the little  show closer and  they have to make  like they're a  loving married  couple.  It's like, oh  my, oh, Carol,  come here, let me  give you a kiss, I  guess.  I can smell that  vagina from up  here. 
[02:26:30]  Mind if I sleep in  the boys' room  tonight, Carol?  Greg, do you  think I could  shove that big  horse sculptor at  the bottom of the  stairs up my ass?  Let's try.  There's one scene  where one of the  Brady kids, like  one of their kids,  like whether it was  Marsh's little  eight-year-old  red-headed son,  slid down the  banister and Robert  Reed was at the  bottom to catch him.  I'll catch you, 
[02:27:00]  come on down.  Oh, he's coming  so fast.  So am I.  Oh, yeah.  I love those  boys.  Stupid.  Girls, you okay?  All right, good  night.  Hi, boys.  Let me tuck in and  read you a little  story.  Once upon a time,  there was a  homosexual actor  playing a dad.  Well, I understand  that he would  molest Bobby and  Greg, but he  wouldn't molest  Peter because Peter  wasn't mechanically 
[02:27:30]  inclined.  Peter, why don't you  put on the Phil  Packer mustache you  wore in episode 33  and, you know,  tickle my little  member down here  with that mustache.  all right, boys,  we're going to play  Steal the Playbook.  I put it in my  pants.  You boys got to  steal it so Greg  can read the plays  and I rolled up 
[02:28:00]  these plants and  put them in this  tube.  Now you've got to  hide them in me.  And we're back.  It's the O.P.  and Anthony  program live from  Mardi Gras, New  Orleans, Crazy Horse, 
[02:28:30]  Balcony, Beans,  Tits,  everything.  People getting  pelted by mugs  from Tom.  Tom never cooled  it, by the way.  He's been just  tagging people as  they walk by with  the O.P.  and Anthony mugs.  That's going to be  great later on when  we get punched in  the face.  Are you O.P.?  Yeah.  Pow!  Blah!  Blam!  Blah!  We've got a lot  of fans here.  It's unbelievable.  A lot of people  stopping by saying  hi.  They've got O.P.  and Anthony  t-shirts on and  signs. 
[02:29:00]  It's just absolutely  crazy.  What's up, Ben?  Hey, that girl's got  a red hurricane.  Where?  I've got some  green things.  I want a red  hurricane.  God damn it.  Wasn't the green  thing a hand grenade  or whatever they're  called?  A hand grenade.  It's a hand grenade.  What about the  hurricane?  Yeah, the hurricanes  are the red ones.  We need a few  hurricanes.  We need some  hurricanes.  You sent Tom out.  What do you expect?  I know.  He came back.  Don't send him  again.  He'll probably spit  in it as a joke.  By the way,  Norton is late  coming back to the  broadcast because I  saw him in the  hall negotiating with  one of the strippers.  I don't know what 
[02:29:30]  the hell's going on.  Are you kidding  already?  Norton, I noticed  you were negotiating  with one of the fine  young ladies that works  here at the crazy  horse.  Well, I asked  somebody how much a  lap dance was and  they said for up here  it's $40.  Are you kidding?  Yeah.  So I said lap dance  is not happening.  They got some very  interesting rooms up  here.  They're kind of like  cubicles with just  couches in them.  You notice that?  Now, you don't know  what's happening though,  Jimmy.  What's that?  That might be a  bargain.  I know what's  happening.  He knows what's  happening.  Yeah. 
[02:30:00]  Are you going to  taste the local  fare while you're  down here?  Yeah, I'm going to  walk around and see  what's going on.  Yeah.  I want to lap dance  badly.  By the way, where  are we eating dinner  tonight on Anthony's  Cab?  I'm paying.  You pick this  play.  I don't care where  we go.  I just don't want to  walk through like,  you know, masses like  that.  No, we figured this  out.  Find a good spot.  You get off Bourbon  Street, it gets much  cooler.  You go up to like  Decatur up by where  the House of Blues is,  that's where it is.  Find a good spot.  We had a great time  at House of Blues the  first night we were  here and then we  found out Greg  Allman's playing  tomorrow night.  I think we're going  to go check that 
[02:30:30]  out after the  broadcast tomorrow.  Yeah, we got tickets  for Greg Allman  tomorrow night.  Yeah, very cool.  Let's go.  That's going to be  awesome.  And then we found  this dive bar that  was pretty cool with  the jukebox.  That's Dan Aykroyd's  favorite bar in the  country.  Really?  That's how, yeah.  It's a complete  dive though, man.  There was nothing  going on in there,  but the music was  great.  Well, the House of  Blues was getting  built here in New  Orleans.  That's where everyone  hung out, all the  celebrities.  That's where they  still all go when  they're in New  ones.  Right on.  Anthony, we got to  talk about the  Vermont Teddy Bear  Company.  We're doing live  reads on the show.  The show getting  more gooder by the  day, Anthony. 
[02:31:00]  Much more gooder.  Yeah, Valentine's  Day, right?  You got to do  something for your  sweetie.  You got to get her  something and don't  get the flowers, the  chocolate.  What are you going to  do?  Get the Brax  chocolate?  You're going to go  into the pharmacy  last minute, get that  little heart-shaped  box of Brax?  No.  Some ass one year  told me, I'm  I should get a  heart-shaped  necklace.  Remember that?  Oh, that's true.  Who is that?  That awful, awful  Valentine's Day that 
[02:31:30]  you and I spent  drinking in some  bar in the middle  of Ashland?  Valentine's Day is  really difficult to  pick out something  special, something  memorable, something  that seems like you  put the personal  touch in.  And guys panic.  One year I was  asking around, they  said, oh man,  heart-shaped  necklace, that's the  way to go.  I think it was  thrown in my face.  And then I called  up Anthony and we  got hammered.  On, what was it,  Route 9 in Ashland  or somewhere up  there?  Yeah.  Or in, what the  hell were we?  Framingham maybe?  Framingham or 
[02:32:00]  Westboro, whatever.  Yeah, so we're  saying, no flowers,  no stupid chocolates.  Well, if you want to  do the chocolate-bear  combo, that's not a  bad thing.  Yeah.  Because if you just  get the chocolate,  eat the chocolate,  it's gone, and then  where's the memory of  the love that you  gave her that year?  And they get  fatter anyway if  they eat just  chocolate.  Right.  Have some celery,  you slob, and  hold your bear.  We've never heard  complaints when  somebody has, you  know, tried the  Vermont teddy bear  thing.  So, it's got  personality, and it  could be, you  know, there's so  many bears to  choose from, you 
[02:32:30]  can customize it to  your loved one.  We got the  lover boy bear,  heart-shaped love  tattoo, the  gangster love, the  heartthrob bear  wearing boxer  shorts, the  mysterious love  bandit, or the  officially licensed  new playboy bear  with a smoking  jacket, martini  glass.  If you're romantic,  send the Cupid bear  or the Romeo  bear, and you  could also get  bears that are  linked to their  occupation or  hobby, like a  heart-shaped, a  heart-racer bear, or  a love-handle bear  dressed like a  trucker.  Best of all, she'll 
[02:33:00]  think of you every  time she hugs her  little bear.  Shop at  vermont teddybear.com  or call one of  their friendly bear  counselors, 1-800-89-B-T-A-R.

If you call that  number, make sure you  tell the fine folks  at Vermont Teddy Bear  that Opie and  Anthony sent you.  And I quickly just  want to welcome those  guys to the program.  Very cool that they're  back on board with us.  Yes.  All right. 
[02:34:00]  I don't know.  I guess we're kind of  wrapping up the  festivities here from  Mardi Gras.  Festivus, Jerry.  I can't hear myself.  So what are we doing  tonight?  We're going to check  out the dancers here  for a while?  I think what we'll do  is kind of hang around  a little bit after the  show, go inside, check  out some of the  dancers.  I want to see how  that dancer that's on  the rag moves.  I want to figure that  whole thing out, right?  To keep from any  leakage.  After she gets off  the stage, it looks  like a Japanese flag. 
[02:34:30]  What's up with the  sirens below us?  Anybody?  They're looking for  Tom, probably.  I guess we've got to  get Tom back on the  air.  I know Jimmy doesn't  want this.  He was yelling  before when everybody  went for a break and  I was sitting here, he  came over.  You've got to get me  back on the air for  real with the  headphones.  None of that  bullshit on the air.  And he's bringing  me by another  stripper I see too.  Oh, is he  molesting her too?  We've got to call  them dancers actually.  For some reason,  something happened  with the strippers  thing. 
[02:35:00]  They don't want to  be called strippers  anymore.  They want to be  called exotic  dancers.  Wow, I'm seeing a  girl walk down and  I am going to put  these beads right  in that cleavage.  You're going to  give it a shot,  Anthony?  I'm going to give  it a shot.  She's got to have  at least double  beads.  Here we go.  Just wobbling.  Oh!  That was really  close.  Who did that more?  That's the girl I  was going to get,  you bastards.  Alright, you had  the shot of the  day by the way.  Anthony, you  threw beads so  hard before that  they ended up  around the girl's  neck and just  spun around once  and landed  perfectly.  I got a ringer.  Oh my God,  what is this mess?  What does she  want? 
[02:35:30]  Here you go.  I'm going to  throw him a cup.  There you go.  Take your cup.  She can drink her  Geritol out of it.  Her husband's 80.  Here's an XM  prostate for you.  Let's say hi to  Tom from New  Orleans.  How you guys  doing?  Hey, Tom.  You're not supposed  to be touching  the strippers or  the dancers, I  should say.  The dancers.  Hey, what's her  name?  Huh?  What's your name,  baby?  My name's Carly.  Carly.  Wow.  She's absolutely  beautiful.  She is beautiful.  Tom, get your  hand off her  bit, Tom.  She just got  really pissed off. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  She got really,  really pissed.  He just casually  had his arm around  her and then he  just felt her up.  I know.  He started grabbing  her breast.  Tom, you got to  treat the girl  with some respect.  I do.  I do.  She's dancing now  up here.  She could shave  her armpits a  little bit.  Wow, that's  heroin chic, isn't  it?  Yeah.  Tom, does she  have a nice  hiney?  You got to  wait, honey.  How's her  hiney?  She won't  show it.  Let's just  turn around.  Look at that.  Oh, Tom's  going to stick  a thumb in it.  A lot of  plump. 
[02:36:30]  I've got  deep feet.  What an awful  man he is.  He's checking  out all the  girls.  Yo, guys,  this one ain't  bleeding.  What about  going?  What about  going, tiny?  Oh, yeah.  Why does he  have to touch?  Why is he  always touching  you, Jimmy?  Jimmy, stop it.  Jimmy, I love  you.  Jimmy, make  my week and  punch him in  his face.  I almost did  when he licked  the headphones  before, but I  knew if I did,  Kenny would  jump in and  kill him.  Make my  week.  Kenny would  kill him.  You actually  were protecting  him by not  hitting him like  that.  Thank you, Jimmy.  I want to  have fun with  you tonight,  bud.  He's patting  you now.  He's patting  you.  Tom, what's  the rest of  your night  going to be 
[02:37:00]  like?  I think we're  going to go  out and have  a couple of  drinks with  Jimmy.  What's this  weed shit?  Not you.  Not you  with your  girlfriend now.  I got a  vacuum and  get divorced  and then got  my girlfriend.  Tom, that  was going on  the last time  he was here.  I know.  Well, you're  coming.  I'm not  hanging out  with you.  You're coming.  I'm not  hanging out  with you.  When was  the last time  you were  sober?  Seriously,  because this  whole Marty  thing happens  all year long.  This morning  at like 5 a.m. 
[02:37:30]  when I woke  up.  That was it.  You drink  every day,  right?  Yeah.  Pretty much  every day?  Yeah.  And Bourbon  Street's like  this almost  every day,  right?  No.  It's just  wild every  day.  No.  On the  weekends,  though?  No.  Yeah.  It's wild  on the  weekends.  What's the  drug of  choice for  tonight?  Hallucinogenics.  Can't do  a little  shroom  action?  Well, hey  Tom.  Oh, wait.  I'm sorry.  I think  it was Tom.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Thanks, Jimmy.  I like him  on my pizza.  I'm sorry.  I was talking  to the back 
[02:38:00]  of the garbage  truck.  Hey, I'm  talking with  Tom Brady.  All right.  Thank you, Tom.  Why don't we  take the headphones  home?  Tom, thank you.  All right.  Away from Tom.  You guys are  great.  Thank you for  the great spot  here at Mardi Gras.  You guys rock.  You guys rock.  And I hope we  party tonight.  All right.  We'll make sure  we do not party  with you tonight.  But thanks for  the offer.  Yeah.  Oh, good.  His headphones  are off.  Yeah.  We're not going  out with Tom.  Absolutely not.  He is.  My chick came  up to me and  said, Tom is so  wasted.  He came up to  her and said,  Hey, I am 
[02:38:30]  taking mushrooms  and I am so  hallucinating.  Right now?  Yeah.  So he's not even  waiting until later.  He's already  taking some.  Oh, he's giving  you the finger.  You can't hear  anything.  Club Soda Kenny,  remove this guy.  He's becoming a  problem.  Remove him right  now.  If he thinks  he's getting me  a Hummer,  that's not  happening.  I'd rather have  Ope get me a  Hummer by giving  me Ant.  All right.  Deal. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, that guy's  that guy's cup  right there.  Watch.  Oh, that was  really close.  And then they  all look up at me  and they want to  kill me.  I had nothing  to do with that.  Wow.  You don't know  how to look away,  dude.  You got to look  away when that  happens.  Take the quick  glance.  Get your joy  out of it.  It hit the  cup directly,  but.  Oh, the lady  in the wheelchair  smoking a  cigarette.  She looked like  she needed a  Ope and Anthony  beer mug.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  She's in a  wheelchair chain 
[02:39:30]  smoking.  That's really  smart.  That's fine.  Why don't you  throw down a  couple of good  feet?  Yeah, this is  the end of the  program, guys.  This is what  you get today.  This is it.  And tomorrow.  And tomorrow.  It's going to be  worse tomorrow.  It's going to be  louder.  You know what  this shows us?  That we were  right last time  we were here.  That we should  never broadcast  from Morning  Girl.  Remember, three  years ago, we  left here.  We had a good  time.  And we went,  all right, we'll 
[02:40:00]  never do that  again.  Never come  back.  The broadcast  stinks.  It just doesn't  make sense.  I think it was  fun today.  We actually had a  pretty good time.  A lot of fun.  And it's only  three hours.  It's just funny,  though.  After ten minutes,  everyone forgets  that we're trying  to do a radio  show, and they're  on the balcony  trying to talk to  us.  They talk to you.  Trying to hand us  drugs and drinks.  Guys from the  streets.  Look at this guy.  He's yelling at us.  And they talk to you.  Right.  And we can't hear  what they say.  And then they  throw us the  finger because we  can't hear them.  Yeah, like they're  trying to carry on  a conversation. 
[02:40:30]  We're doing a show  here.  Right.  We're doing a show  and what we think  is a show.  Hey, what's up?  We have a lot of fans  here.  Why are people  so into cups?  I never knew  that was a thing  here at Mardi Gras.  People want  free things.  Is it just free stuff?  Dude, if you were  throwing colon cancer  off the balcony,  they'd be running  with their arms  up to grab it.  It's amazing.  Colostomy bags.  Here comes the  Asian girl with a  tree right through  her.  Throwing used  colostomy bags.  Hopefully it would  hit Tom in the  mouth to make it  smell better.  Using his mouth 
[02:41:00]  watch.  He's the only guy  that would go to  the dentist.  Dentist would go,  all right, rinse.  No, just swallow it.  You should take some  of these huge beads  and floss with it.  You know,  Club Soda Kenny  has a dentist joke,  I think.  Really?  Yeah.  I've been reminded  that Club Soda Kenny  might have a dentist  joke.  Kenny's getting his  headphones on.  We all love  Kenny's jokes.  Kenny's taking his  job very serious  today.  I like that.  Doing it very well.  I like that a lot.  We haven't seen  any flashing lately,  Anthony.  No.  Girls are getting 
[02:41:30]  free stuff here  is what it is.  Kenny, do you have  a dentist joke  in honor of Tom  from New Orleans?  I hate him.  You don't like him  at all, right?  Kenny is really  not liking it.  Hey, Kenny,  think of it this way.  You know how you  feel about Tom?  That's how XM  feels about you.  Isn't that awful?  That is bad.  Now you can kind of  see what type of  hatred is going on  there.  Listen, I heard you  talk about Michael  Jackson the other  day.  May I make an  observation?  Certainly.  Do you know  what the difference  between Michael  Jackson and acne 
[02:42:00]  is?  What?  Acne comes on  your face after  you're 13.  Wow.  Not bad.  Very good.  What about the  dentist joke in  honor of Tom?  Oh.  You know what  time a Chinaman  goes to the  dentist?  What time?  2.30.  2.30.  Yeah.  I get it.  Thank you,  Kenny.  All right in the  drink.  It was a direct  hit that went 
[02:42:30]  right into the  guy's drink.  One hit him in  the face.  The rest went  right in the  drink and he  is pissed.  That was a good  one.  What a direct  hit.  Now he's throwing  him back at the  wrong side of the  balcony.  Good.  That's fine.  We're all  broadcasting.  I'm holding  cups.  Dude, that hit  perfect.  I'm glad I got a  direct hit.  That actually went  right through to  Governor Connolly's  back.  See, why didn't  he just throw the  beads at him while  he was coming up  instead of waiting  for him to turn  on Elm?  That was a tough  shot. 
[02:43:00]  Hey, that balcony  is getting a lot  more action than  we are as far as  the girls flashing.  Yeah, because we're  not asking for it.  We're just kind of  giving the girls  stuff.  You know, I'm being  handed notes.  If this is not a  hint, probably from  Washington.  Yeah.  Ben's holding up  big notes that just  say, you can get  off the air whenever  you want.  Oh, brother.  A big sign.  You can get off  whenever you want.  Hint, hint.  Yeah, you've done  a great job.  Leave.  Yeah, leave now.  Let's get Martini  Steve on the air  before we get out  of here for the 
[02:43:30]  night.  Martini Steve.  Oh, an open cup  walking by and I  missed it.  A lot of people  responding on the  message boards  said, like, why are  Opie and Anthony  only broadcasting  three hours instead  of four?  Now you know the  answer to that  question.  Right.  Martini Steve, you  ready to drink  tonight or what?  We'll see.  We'll see.  I have to.  I've been very  responsible for the  last 48 hours.  I don't know how  much longer I can  keep this up.  Well, it wasn't 48  hours, but.  Oh, Super Bowls.  Hold on.  I've got to bounce  this thing. 
[02:44:00]  Bouncing hard,  Opie.  Don't hit anybody  with it.  Bouncing.  Come on, bounce.  Oh, hit the roof.  And there it goes.  Point, point, point.  Into the sleeves.  You know that's  coming back up to  at us with the  balcony.  Steve, you're going  to have a couple  of martinis tonight  with us?  We'll see.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Ant's paying if he  doesn't go back to  the room.  Oh, really?  I'm out.  It's on me.  I'm going out.  Oh, really?  I'm out tonight.  Fantastic.  Fantastic, then. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, now they're  looking at me.  I was going to  wing it into her  drink.  Why don't we wrap  this mess up that  we call the  Anthony program?  Don't forget, we  got to mention the  Tara Patrick info  one more time.  That's all.  Okay.  You mentioned it  there, Steve.  All right.  You got the...  Can I do it?  Wow, is that a kid  or a...  Tara Patrick.  Where?  She's looking for  a five-pound toy  fox, Tara,  the $5,000 reward  to the dog.  You can email her  at Tara at  clubterra.com.  Where's she making  her appearance  tomorrow night,  Steve?  And, yes, I am.  She's hosting a  Mardi Gras party  tomorrow at  Larry Flan's 
[02:45:00]  Hustler Club.  Where's the  hustler club?  Yeah, good.  He can fucking  giggle all he wants,  pardon my French.  I'll throw him  off his balcony  if he doesn't  shut up.  Oh, God.  Who?  Why the anger,  Steve?  Why the anger?  Why the anger?  Oh, nothing.  Nothing.  I haven't thrown a  cup or a  goddamn beat  at anybody.  I've been running  around like a  chicken with its  head cut off  all day.  That's all.  Who are you  mad at?  Oh, nobody.  Nobody, not at all.  Anyway, I'm having  a great time.  Maybe I will  drink tonight.  Anthony, what I  was asking, is  that a kid or  like a fidget?  A fidget standing 
[02:45:30]  next to the big  guy?  Yeah, and then  I pointed and  then that guy who  I believe is the  father of that  looked up and  gave me the  look of death.  No, it's a  father and son.  It is a son.  Yeah.  It kind of  looks like a  little Webster.  It looks like a  little Webster,  actually.  It's like a  mini version of  the father.  Oh, he's leaving  the kid alone.  Oh, no, no.  See, that's the  mother there.  All right.  Why don't we wrap  this up like we  said about five  times?  Cowboy hat,  cowboy hat.  We'll do this  all over again  tomorrow, live  from Bourbon 
[02:46:00]  Street in New  Orleans.  New Orleans, it's  Mardi Gras.  Thanks for  listening.  We'll see you  tomorrow.  No, I'm not  waiting this time,  Jimmy.  Thank you.  Bye.  It's coming to  the gay channel.  What is up?  It's the second  annual male group  orgy competition.  And he hits the  hole right after  Jesse opens it up.  With your host,  John Madden and  Pat Summerall.  And then everyone's  kind of slopping  around down there  and grunting and  groaning and, you  know, you get  modern stuff flying 
[02:46:30]  and gang tackles and  scrums and  quagmires.  No fems, fats or  hairies, just the  hunkiest gay studs and  wild group action  competition.  I'd like to pack  that guy around  too.  Don't get carried  away, John.  There was all kinds  of stuff flying  around there.  It's male group  sex to die for as  described by the  best play-by-play  team in the biz.  That was a late  one.  That one didn't  come and didn't  come and didn't  come and finally  they threw it  out of there.  I don't know  where that one 
[02:47:00]  came from.  Look at that  big old meat  lob.  What a meal those  guys are having.  That look good.  That's a good  group.  If you go nuts  for tight butts  you push, you  push, you  push, get  Gaper View  today.  He just rode  him backwards.  Just put him  right on his  back.  With Pat  Summerall and  John Madden.  That looked  like it was the  last shot out  of the Roman  candle.  The second  annual male  group orgy  competition on  Gaper View.  I'd like to  pack that guy  around too.  Floyd, yeah.  He's going to  fire into his  guy right here. 
[02:47:30]  Call 1-800-HEY-CUTIE  to order today.  That's it.  I'm out of here. </pre>
